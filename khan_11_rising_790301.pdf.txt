Abstract
Aim: High prevalence of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been reported among the dialysis patients throughout the
world. No serious efforts were taken to investigate HCV in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) treatment who
are at great increased risk to HCV. HCV genotypes are important in the study of epidemiology, pathogenesis and
reaction to antiviral therapy. This study was performed to investigate the prevalence of active HCV infection, HCV
genotypes and to assess risk factors associated with HCV genotype infection in HD patients of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa as well as comparing this prevalence data with past studies in Pakistan.
Methods: Polymerase chain reaction was performed for HCV RNA detection and genotyping in 384 HD patients.
The data obtained was compared with available past studies from Pakistan.
Results: Anti HCV antibodies were observed in 112 (29.2%), of whom 90 (80.4%) were HCV RNA positive. In rest of
the anti HCV negative patients, HCV RNA was detected in 16 (5.9%) patients. The dominant HCV genotypes in HCV
infected HD patients were found to be 3a (n = 36), 3b (n = 20), 1a (n = 16), 2a (n = 10), 2b (n = 2), 1b (n = 4), 4a
(n = 2), untypeable (n = 10) and mixed (n = 12) genotype.
Conclusion: This study suggesting that i) the prevalence of HCV does not differentiate between past and present
infection and continued to be elevated ii) HD patients may be a risk for HCV due to the involvement of multiple
routes of infections especially poor blood screening of transfused blood and low standard of dialysis procedures in
Pakistan and iii) need to apply infection control practice.

Introduction
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public
health problem, with an estimated global prevalence of
3% occurring in about 180 million carriers and approximately 4 million people have been newly infected
annually [1]. The prevalence of HCV infection among
dialysis patients is generally much higher than healthy
blood donors [2] and general population [3]. Studies
held in dialysis centers from different countries revealed
that prevalence ranges form 1-84.6% [2,4] and there is a
particular concern because HCV chronic infection

causes significant morbidity and mortality among
patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) [4].
In Pakistan currently, approximately 10 million people
are suffering from this tremendous disease which cover
6% of the overall population. A high prevalence of HCV
Ab (38% weighted average) was described in the studies
of patients undergoing chronic dialysis in Pakistan [5].
The spread of HCV in Pakistan is fuelled due to lack of
education and awareness of disease, shortage of medically qualified and scientifically trained health care
workers especially dentists, lack of health infrastructure
such as use unsterilized instruments, use of high numbers of therapeutic injections and practice of daily face
and armpit shaving in community barber shops [6,7].
New HCV infection was evidently more frequent at
dialysis centers with higher anti-HCV prevalence and
failure in infection control measures. In some countries,

both prevalence and incidence remain very high, indicating major ongoing nosocomial transmission, probably
due to the limited resources available to treat a rapidly
growing HD population [8].
The striking genetic heterogeneity of the RNA genome
of HCV is well recognized [9,10]. On the basis of molecular relatedness, HCV is classified into 11 major genotypes: 1 through 11, among which first six are major
player of infection globally [9]. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, over 80 subtypes and minor variants
referred to as “quasispecies are existing [10], which differ by 20% to 23% on the basis of full length genomic
sequence comparisons subtype [11]. Identification of
HCV genotype does not influence disease presentation
but is important for its predictive value in term of antiviral therapy, counseling and management [12]. Counseling is indeed a necessity in order to minimize the risk
of transmission of HCV infection to others [13]. This
study investigated the subtypes of HCV infection and
correlate genotypes of the HD patients with the demographic data and risk factors. This study also evaluation
the prevalence of HCV with the past studies in HD
patients conducting in different regions of Pakistan.

Materials and methods
Study Sample and Data Collection

384 HD patients were randomly selected collected from
three hospitals of Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa: Khyber Teaching Hospital, National Diagnostic Dialysis
Center and Dialysis Ward Hayatabad Medical Complex.
All patients were briefed about the study and proper
willing consent was signed.
All patients were interviewed for demographic data
and risk factors to HCV infections including history of
number of blood transfusion, intravenous drug use
(IDU), surgical interventions, and dental treatment, multiple sexual partners, barber shop, piercing instruments
and exposure to known HCV-positive persons, number
of years on dialysis and change of the center. Blood
(5CC in sterile syringes) were collected from HD
patients; sera were separated in two aliquots and frozen
at -70°C for HCV RNA detection and genotyping.
Antibodies Screening

All the subjects were screened for anti HCV antibodies
third generation test according to the manufacture
instructions (Accurate Diagnostics USA).
RNA Isolation, PCR amplification and Detection

RNA was isolated from 100 μL serum, using RNAzole
RNA purification kit (Trizole Inc. USA) as per manufacturer protocols. HCV RNA was Reverse transcribed with
200 U of Maloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Fermentas USA) and amplified with nested

Page 2 of 5

primers specific for 5’ untranslated region of HCV genome. Amplified product was subjected in 2% agarose gel
for electrophoresis.
HCV genotyping

HCV RNA positive samples were genotyped with primers specific for core region of different HCV types by
type specific PCR as mentioned elsewhere [14].
For contamination control RNA extraction, cDNA
amplification and electrophoresis were carried in separate areas. Both negative and positive controls were run
parallel to the patient samples in each batch.
Statistical Analysis

c2 test were used to accesses the association between
HCV positivity and variables. Statistical significance was
evaluated at 0.05 levels.

Results
This study involved 384 patients treated with HD and
was screened for anti HCV and tested for HCV RNA
and HCV genotypes during January 2010-April 2010.
The mean age of the patients was 40.9 ± 5.54 years (age
rang15-75 years). 244 were male (mean age 40.4 ± 8.4)
and 140 were female (age range 41.7 ± 10.07), 340
patients were married (mean age 42.7 ± 8.03) and 48
were unmarried (mean age 28 ± 4). The mean duration
of HD was 6.7 years (range 1-12 years). Change of dialysis centre was noted in twelve patients. Of the total, 112
(29.2%) patients were anti HCV positive; 48 were
females (42.85%) and 64 were males (57.14%). HCV
RNA was detected in 90 (80.4%) anti HCV positive
patients and in 16 (5.9%) anti HCV negative patients.
None positive patients had exposure to known HCVpositive persons.
Genotype distribution

In current study the genotype distribution was as 3a
(42.85%), 3b (23.21%). 2a (14.28%), 1a (16.07%), untypable (8.92%), 1b (3.57%) and 4 (1.78%) (Figure 1).
Risk assessment for HCV infection

Table 1 showed the genotype distribution (%) according
to age and gender. HD patients were classified into four
age groups. The frequency distribution of genotypes in
relation to age revealed that genotype 3a was most common in nearly all age groups while 3b and 2a were comparatively less frequent. Age group with > 46 years were
more affected with mixed genotype while untypable genotype were more common in age group < 45 years.
Genotype 3 (a and b) were common in female as compare to male while genotype 1a, untypable and mixed
were more common in male as compared to female.
Genotype 1b and 4a were found only in male.

Table 2 showed the distribution of different HCV genotypes with relation to different risk factors in HD
patients. Mixed genotype was more prevalent in HD
patients with history of blood transfusion and barber
shops. Mixed and untypable genotype was found significantly more often in HD patients with history of mean
number of 2.28 blood transfusions and genotype 3a, 3b
and mixed genotype were found more commonly in
patients with mean number of 4.61 blood transfusions.
IDUs were found with untypable and mixed genotypes
only. In patients infected through barber shops, genotype 3a and 2a were more prevalent, followed by 3b and
1a genotypes. The most prevalent risk factor for untypable genotype was found to be dental treatment and
barber shop.

Discussion
The HCV infection continues to be a major disease burden on the world. For example, the prevalence of HCV
antibodies among dialysis patients has been reported to
range from: 8 to 36% in North America, 39% in South
America, 1 to 54% in Europe, 17 to 51% in Asia1.2 to
10% in New Zealand and Australia [15]. The first
description of HCV in Pakistan was recorded in 1992
and about 6%, i.e. at least ten million persons are carriers among a population of 140 million, showed there
is no proper review of HCV and it is becoming a Herculean challenge. With the current disease burden, Pakistan has left behind the surrounding countries like
India, Nepal, Myanmar, Iran and Afghanistan [1]. HCV
gained importance particularly as major complication in
multiple transfused patients during the last decades
especially in the countries where HCV is more prevalent
in general population and amongst the blood donors
[16]. This was the first study conducted in patients treated with HD in Pakistan to determine the distribution
of HCV genotypes and their interrelation with risk factors. Even though considerable progress has been
attained during the last years, HCV prevalence rate
among HD patients does not seem to have changed
considerably [17].
The incidence and prevalence of HCV among dialysis
patients varies markedly from country to country
[18-20] and among dialysis centers within a single country [19]. HCV prevalence is much higher in developing
countries as compared to developed world [21]. Table 3
showed that first paper in Pakistan in this line of literature was published in 1999 and till yet six different
reports consisting of small sample size (ranging from
28-190) showed that an HCV percent prevalence of
26.02% among the HD population, rate of Prevalence
become high in past as compared to recent studies. The
prevalence rate of HCV in this study from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa stated that HCV infection was persistent public
health concern in dialysis patients. This study comprised
high prevalence rate might be due to large sample size
as compared to rest of all.
A panel of 30 top gastroenterologists of the country
met in 2004 at a conference and reported that 75%-90%
of HCV Pakistani patients were harboring genotype 3a,
followed by genotype 1 [9], also confirmed in current
and in other different Pakistani population [1,7,27,28].
The prevalence was higher among the males. High
prevalence in male as compared to female could be due
to their exposure to various HCV risk factors [6] particularly barber community and multiple sexual exposures
[10]. In current study 3 was more prevalent in females

to HCV, also supported by various studies
[2,14,20,29,30] but could not recognizes as independent
risk factor in other studies [13,17,20,30].
Needle sharing and household contacts were not significant risk factors in this study, similar to other literature [3,15]. There is an indication that environment of
dialysis treatment itself function as a vehicle in dissemination of HCV among HD patients [29]. A high prevalence of patients with HCV infection in HD facilities has
been considered a risk factor for transmission of the
infection [8]. Several reports have linked a high incidence of HCV infection in dialysis patients who shared
dialysis machines in dialysis unit [15].
This study showed a statistically significant difference
in the prevalence of HCV infection between patients
who were on dialysis for more than five years, and
patients who were on dialysis for less than five years.
Various other studies [2,13,15,18,29-31] confirmed that
duration of HD was considered one of the risk factors
for acquiring HCV infection. Thus strict application of
infection control precautions including early screening
of patients for anti-HCV and separate machines for
anti-HCV positive patients led to a decline in the incidence of seroconversion in HD unit [15].

and 1 in male, as stated in a study that genotype 1 was
more common in male as compared to females [27]. For
HCV prevalence and genotype distribution statistically
no significant difference was found between male
(57.14%) and female patients, verified by other study
[2,12,17]. Old age groups were found more infected
with HCV. It has been suspected that fragile health
structure, unsterilized instruments and use of contaminated razor by barbers may be contributing to the
spread of HCV [5,7].
Blood transfusion(s) constitute a part of treatment in
many HD patients and thus exposed greatly to HCV
[2,14,29]. The risk of hepatitis transmission through
blood transfusion is considered to be high in Pakistani
population due to a lack of appropriate screening of
blood in past. Several studies confirmed the prevalence
of HCV among people with a history of blood transfusion before the advent of blood screening procedures in
Pakistan [6,9]. Percentage prevalence of HCV was 4.95%
± 0.53% in the general adult population and 7.94 ±
1.49% in multi transfused population [9]. The prevalence
found in this study (75%) was greater than that estimated for general adult population in the country. The
multitransfused patients in this study was more prone

Conclusion
It is concluded from pervious and current study that
HCV prevalence in HD patients continued to be elevated in Pakistan. HCV genotype 3 accounts for
approximately one-thirds of HCV-infected HD patients
and the distribution of HCV genotypes in HD patients
is similar to that in other population of Pakistan. High
prevalence of HCV in HD patients demonstrated that
environment of dialysis treatment itself function as a
vehicle in dissemination of HCV among HD patients as
well as they are exposed to the same community risk
factors as general population.
