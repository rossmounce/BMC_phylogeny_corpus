Functional characterization of an alkaline
exonuclease and single strand annealing protein
from the SXT genetic element of Vibrio cholerae
Wen-yang Chen1, John WS Ho1*, Jian-dong Huang2 and Rory M Watt3*

Abstract
Background: SXT is an integrating conjugative element (ICE) originally isolated from Vibrio cholerae, the bacterial
pathogen that causes cholera. It houses multiple antibiotic and heavy metal resistance genes on its ca. 100 kb
circular double stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome, and functions as an effective vehicle for the horizontal transfer of
resistance genes within susceptible bacterial populations. Here, we characterize the activities of an alkaline
exonuclease (S066, SXT-Exo) and single strand annealing protein (S065, SXT-Bet) encoded on the SXT genetic
element, which share significant sequence homology with Exo and Bet from bacteriophage lambda, respectively.
Results: SXT-Exo has the ability to degrade both linear dsDNA and single stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules, but
has no detectable endonuclease or nicking activities. Adopting a stable trimeric arrangement in solution, the
exonuclease activities of SXT-Exo are optimal at pH 8.2 and essentially require Mn2+ or Mg2+ ions. Similar to
lambda-Exo, SXT-Exo hydrolyzes dsDNA with 5’- to 3’-polarity in a highly processive manner, and digests DNA
substrates with 5’-phosphorylated termini significantly more effectively than those lacking 5’-phosphate groups.
Notably, the dsDNA exonuclease activities of both SXT-Exo and lambda-Exo are stimulated by the addition of
lambda-Bet, SXT-Bet or a single strand DNA binding protein encoded on the SXT genetic element (S064, SXT-Ssb).
When co-expressed in E. coli cells, SXT-Bet and SXT-Exo mediate homologous recombination between a PCRgenerated dsDNA fragment and the chromosome, analogous to RecET and lambda-Bet/Exo.
Conclusions: The activities of the SXT-Exo protein are consistent with it having the ability to resect the ends of
linearized dsDNA molecules, forming partially ssDNA substrates for the partnering SXT-Bet single strand annealing
protein. As such, SXT-Exo and SXT-Bet may function together to repair or process SXT genetic elements within
infected V. cholerae cells, through facilitating homologous DNA recombination events. The results presented here
significantly extend our general understanding of the properties and activities of alkaline exonuclease and single
strand annealing proteins of viral/bacteriophage origin, and will assist the rational development of bacterial
recombineering systems.

Background
The SXT mobile genetic element was originally isolated
from an emerging epidemic strain of Vibrio cholerae
(serogroup O139), which causes the severe diarrheal disease cholera [1]. Formerly referred to as a conjugative
transposon, SXT is now classified as being a type of

integrating conjugative element (ICE) [2,3]. Unlike bacteriophages and plasmids, ICEs cannot replicate their
double stranded DNA (dsDNA) genomes autonomously.
They integrate into the chromosome of the bacterial
host, and replicate along with the host’s chromosomal
DNA. In response to certain physiological signals, they
excise their genomic material and form a covalently
closed circular double stranded (extrachromosomal)
molecule [4]. SXT inserts its ca. 100 kb dsDNA genome
into the 5’-end of the prfC gene on the V. cholerae chromosome in a site-specific manner [5]. After induction of
the SOS response, SXT excises itself and re-circularizes

into an extrachromosomal form which may be transferred by bacterial conjugation to recipient donor cells
[3,6]. The genomic composition of SXT is closely related
to that of R391, an ICE originally isolated from Providencia rettgeri (originally referred to as an IncJ element)
[7], and they are fellow members of a large family of
self-transmissible mobile genetic elements [3,4,8,9]. The
SXT/R391 ICEs encode multiple proteins conveying
resistance towards heavy metals (e.g. mercury) and antibiotics (e.g. sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, chloramphenicol and streptomycin) [2]. As such, they are
efficient vehicles for the horizontal transfer of resistance
genes within susceptible bacterial populations [3,6,8-11].
The SXT genome contains three consecutive coding
DNA sequences (CDSs; s064, s065 and s066) arranged
in an operon-like structure, which encode homologues
of ‘phage-like’ proteins involved in DNA repair and/or
recombination [2] (see Additional File 1 Panel A). The
encoded S064 protein (SXT-Ssb) is highly homologous
to bacterial single strand DNA (ssDNA) binding proteins (Ssb); S065 (SXT-Bet) is homologous to the Bet
single stranded annealing protein (SSAP) from bacteriophage lambda (lambda-Bet, which is also referred to
as a DNA synaptase or recombinase); and S066 (SXTExo) shares homology with the lambda Exo/YqaJ family
of alkaline exonucleases [12,13] (See Additional File 1
Panel B). Related ICEs (e.g. R391, ICEVchB33 and ICEPdaSpaI) all encode essentially identical bet, exo and ssb
genes (>99% nucleotide identity) within highly similar
genetic contexts [7,9,14].
Alkaline exonucleases are widely found in the genomes of viruses (especially herpesviridae), bacteriophages and other self-transmissible genetic elements
[13,15]. The alkaline exonuclease from bacteriophage
lambda (lambda-Exo) has been the subject of intense
study since its discovery and isolation in the 1960s
[16-25]. However, the in vitro activities of only one
other closely-related homologue have been studied in
any great detail; namely G34.1P from bacteriophage
SPP1 (SPP1-Chu) [26,27]. The SPP1-Chu and lambdaExo alkaline exonucleases both digest linear dsDNA
molecules with strict 5’- to 3’- polarity. They bind to
the termini of the dsDNA molecules and progressively
hydrolyze the 5’-strand in a highly processive manner,
releasing 5’-mononucleotides and generating long 3’ssDNA tails [17,21,26,27] (see Additional File 2 for a
schematic overview). The partnering SSAP protein
(lambda-Bet or G35P, respectively) coats the nascent 3’ssDNA tails, forming helical nucleoprotein filaments
[28,29], and promotes their annealing with complementary regions of (partially) single stranded DNA on the
bacteriophage, episome or host chromosome [30-32].
This ‘strand annealing’ pathway may occur at double
strand breaks (DSBs) or at the replication fork. Other

host cell DNA recombinases (synaptases) such as RecA
may also play a role in recombination events, and
strand invasion of an intact DNA duplex may, or may
not occur [20,32-34]. DNA repair and replication proteins from the bacterial host cell then process and
resolve the branched DNA intermediates formed
[20,33]. The alkaline exonuclease may also ‘trim’ any
ssDNA overhangs formed after SSAP-mediated annealing events, enabling the resultant nicks to be closed by
DNA ligase [21,23].
Aside from their native biological roles, the activities
of partnering SSAP and alkaline exonuclease proteins (e.
g. lambda-Bet/Exo, RecET and Che9c gp60/61) have
attracted increasing interest for their use in bacterial in
vivo DNA homologous recombination-based genetic
engineering procedures [35-41]. In an approach referred
to as ‘recombineering’, partnering SSAP and alkaline
exonuclease proteins co-expressed within a bacterial
host cell efficiently mediate homologous DNA recombination (genetic crossover) between PCR-generated linear
dsDNA molecules and the desired chromosomal or episomal target, via short regions (ca. 35-50 bp) of shared
sequence homology. Phenotypic changes or selectable
markers e.g. antibiotic resistance genes are generally
required to detect recombination events. Although the
precise mechanism has not yet been established, it
appears that only partnering alkaline exonuclease and
SSAP proteins (i.e. ones from the same biological system) can associate with each other and function
together to promote DNA recombination; e.g. lambdaExo does not bind to, or functionally-cooperate with the
E. coli RecT protein [42].
Genetic studies have recently revealed that the SXTBet (S065) and SXT-Exo (S066) proteins promote DNA
recombination between two different ICE molecules
residing within the same heterologous host cell (Escherichia coli), leading to the formation of ‘hybrid’ ICEs [10].
Furthermore, Datta et al. [39] have recently shown that
SXT-Bet can efficiently promote genetic recombination
between single stranded oligonucleotides and the E. coli
chromosome. This prompted us to characterize the biochemical and biological activities of the SXT-Exo and
Bet proteins, to help establish their proposed involvement in DNA recombination events.
Here, we show that SXT-Exo is a processive alkaline
exonuclease with the ability to digest linear, but not circular ssDNA and dsDNA molecules. We further demonstrate that SSAP and Ssb proteins stimulate the in vitro
dsDNA exonuclease activities of SXT-Exo. When
expressed from plasmids established in E. coli cells, the
SXT-Exo and SXT-Bet proteins mediate the homologous recombination of PCR-generated dsDNA fragments
with the chromosome via short flanking regions of
shared sequence homology.

Methods
Materials

All oligonucleotides were purchased from TechDragon
Ltd. (Shatin, Hong Kong) in a desalted (Bio-RP) form.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using
Expand DNA polymerase and buffers (Roche), containing PCR-grade deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs,
Roche), on a GeneAmp 9700 thermal cycler (Applied
Biosystems). Plasmids were purchased from Novagen
and Invitrogen. Restriction enzymes were purchased
from New England Biolabs (NEB), and digestions were
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
DNA was routinely analyzed after electrophoresis on 1%
agarose (Invitrogen) in Tris-acetate EDTA (TAE, USB)
gels. Visualization and quantification of DNA bands
(densitometry) was performed after staining with ethidium bromide (Sigma) using UV trans-illumination on a
ChemiDoc XRS molecular imaging system with Quantity One v4.6.6 software (BioRad). Plasmid DNA was
routinely purified from 4 ml (stationary phase) overnight
cultures using Qiaprep spin miniprep kits (Qiagen). PCR
products and DNA excised from agarose gels were purified using Qiaquick PCR purification and gel extraction
kits (Qiagen), respectively. Where applicable, linearized
DNA was dephosphorylated using calf intestinal phosphatase (NEB), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, then gel-purified. DNA and protein alignments,
sequence analysis, primer design, etc. were performed
using Omiga v2.0 (Oxford Molecular). Graphs were prepared using OriginPro 7.5 SR1 (OriginLabs).
Strains, plasmids and Media

Plasmid pJB1 was constructed by Dr. John Beaber and
was generously supplied by Prof. Matthew Waldor (Harvard Medical School and HHMI). pJB1 contains the
region of the SXT integrating conjugative element (ICE)
that includes the ssb (s064), bet (s065) and exo (s066)
genes, was used as the template for the PCR-amplification of all SXT genes. Plasmid pBAD-ETg [35] was generously supplied by Prof. A. Francis Stewart (TU Dresden).
All arabinose-inducible plasmids constructed here are
derivatives of pBAD-ETg (see Additional File 3), and contain identical 4503 bp NcoI/HindIII backbone fragments,
which houses the ColE1 ori, bla ampicillin resistance
gene, araC repressor, P BAD operator/promoter region,
and ribosome binding site immediately upstream of the
adjacent NcoI and NdeI restriction sites.
All gene targeting, gene cloning and plasmid propagation procedures were performed in E. coli DH10B [Invitrogen, genotype: F- mcrA Δ(mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC)

cells by electroporation using a MicroPulser electroporator with 1 mm gap electroporation cuvettes (BioRad).
Transformed cells were plated onto Luria-Bertani (LB)
agar (USB), and liquid cultures were grown in LB medium (USB); supplementing with kanamycin (Kan, 50 μg/
ml, USB), ampicillin (Amp, 50 μg/ml, USB) and/or
chloramphenicol (Cm, 30 μg/ml, Sigma) for plasmid
maintenance, where appropriate. LB-agar containing
chloramphenicol (12 μg/ml) was used to select for E.
coli strains containing chromosome-based copies of the
chloramphenicol (cat) resistance gene. Protein expression was performed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) or BL21
(DE3) pLysS Rosetta (Novagen); inducing expression by
the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-b-D-galactopyranoside
(IPTG, USB) to between 0.1 to 0.5 mM; incubating cultures post-induction at 20-37°C.
Plasmid construction

The SXT-exo (s066) gene [GenBank:AY055428.1, 73921 74937] was PCR amplified from plasmid pJB1, using the
Sexofor (TATACATATGAAGGTTATCGACCTATCAC)
and SexoRevX (TTAACTCGAGTTAAAAATAAAATGAGCTCGGCGA) primers. After NdeI/XhoI digestion
(restriction sites underlined), it was cloned into pET28a
(Novagen) to create pEA1-1. The lambda-exo gene was
PCR-amplified from bacteriophage lambda cI857 ind1
Sam7 DNA (NEB) using the exofor1 (TATAACATATGACACCGGACATTATCCTG)
and
exorev3
(TTATCTCGAGTCGCCATTGCTCCCCAAA) primers,
and cloned via NdeI/XhoI into pET32a (Novagen) to create pEE4. The SXT-bet (s065) gene [GenBank:AY055428.1,
72817 - 73635] was PCR amplified from plasmid pJB1
using the SXTNdeI (TTAACATATGGAAAAACCAAAGCTAATCCAA) and SXTXhoI (TATACTCGAGCTAAGAAGCTAAAGGCTGTGTGAG) primers,
then cloned via NdeI/XhoI into pET28a to create plasmid
pX28-1 (N-terminal His-T7 tagged SXT-Bet). The SXTssb (s064) gene [GenBank: AY055428.1, 72318 - 72737]
was PCR amplified from plasmid pJB1 using the SSBfor1
(TATAGAATTCACCATGGGAAACCAAGTAACACTCATAGGC) and SSBrevX (TTAACTCGAGTTA
AAAATCTGGTTCAGGATAAGTTTG) primers, then
cloned via EcoRI/XhoI into pET28a to create plasmid
pSB2. The lambda-bet gene was PCR-amplified from bacteriophage lambda cI857 ind1 Sam7 DNA (NEB) using the
betfor1 (TATAACATATGAGTACTGCACTCGCAACG)
and
betrev2
(TATTCTCGAGTGCTGCCACCTTCTGCTCTG) primers, digested with NdeI/XhoI
and cloned into pET32a to create p1DB.
Plasmids pB1E4, pBex4b1, pBX2B and pBAD-28MCS
are all derivatives of plasmid pG5P4-1, which contains
the 4503 bp NcoI/HindIII ‘backbone’ of the pBAD-ETg
plasmid [35]. First, pG1.2A was created by PCR-amplifying the cloning the gam gene from bacteriophage

lambda cI857 ind1 Sam7 using the gamfor1 (TATAACATATGGATATTAATACTGAAACT) and gamrev2
(ATATTCTCGAGTACCTCTGAATCAATATC) primers, then cloning it into pET32a via NdeI/XhoI. Then,
the gam gene and downstream hexahistidine tag were
PCR amplified from pG1.2A using the gamLbad1
(TATGCCATGGGCCATATGGATATTAATACTGAAACTGAG)
and
XHh6
(TACCAAGCTTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTG) primers, the ca. 425
bp PCR product was digested with NcoI/HindIII, and
then ligated with the 4503 bp NcoI/HindIII backbone of
pBADETg to create pG5P4-1. All genes were cloned
into pG5P4-1 in such a way as to replace the gam gene.
All reverse PCR primers included a stop codon preceding the XhoI site, so that they did not encode C-terminal hexahistidine fusions).
The contiguous bet and exo genes from bacteriophage
lambda cI857 ind1 Sam7 were PCR amplified using the
betfor1 and exorev4 (TTATCTCGAGTCATCGCCATTGCTCCCCAA) primers. The ca. 1470 bp PCR
product was digested with Nde/XhoI and cloned into
plasmid pG5P4-1 to create plasmid pB1E4 (placing them
both under the control of a PBAD promoter immediately
upstream of bet). The region of SXT containing adjacent
SXT-bet and SXT-exo genes (GenBank: AY055428.1,
72817 - 74937) was PCR amplified from pJB1 using the
SXTNdeI and SexorevX primers; then the ca. 1590 bp
PCR product was digested with NdeI/XhoI and cloned
into pG5P4-1 to create plasmid pBex4b1 (placing the
SXT bet-exo genes under the control of a PBAD promoter
immediately upstream of SXT-bet).
The region of SXT containing adjacent SXT-ssb, bet
and exo genes (GenBank: AY055428.1, 72318 - 74937)
was PCR amplified from pJB1 using the Ssbfor1 and
SexorevX primers; then the ca. 2630 bp PCR product
was digested with EcoRI/XhoI and cloned into pG5P4-1
to create plasmid pBX2B (placing the SXT ssb-bet-exo
genes under the control of a P BAD promoter immediately upstream of SXT-ssb). For a control plasmid, the
ca. 140 bp multiple cloning site from pET28a was
excised by digestion with NcoI/XhoI, and was cloned
into pG5P4-1 to create plasmid pBAD-28MCS.
Protein expression, purification and analysis of
multimericity

E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLys Rosetta containing pEA1-1 was
grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin at
37°C to an OD600 of ~0.60; IPTG (0.4 mM) was added,
then cultures were incubated at 30°C for 6 hours. The
washed cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (25
mM Tris-HCl pH7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole)
then lysed by sonication. After centrifugation (15,000 g,
30 min; 0.45 μm filtered) the supernatant was applied to
a 5 ml Hitrap Chelating FF column (GE Healthcare)

that had been charged with nickel (II) ions. His-tagged
SXT-Exo was eluted using a linear gradient of imidazole
in lysis buffer (25-500 mM). Fractions containing pure
protein were pooled, and buffer was exchanged using a
G-25 Sephadex desalting column (GE Healthcare) preequilibrated with 25 mM Tris-HCl pH7.4, 50 mM NaCl.
The SXT-Bet, SXT-Ssb, lambda-Exo and lambda-Bet
proteins were analogously expressed from their respective pET-based expression vectors in BL21 (DE3), grown
in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin or 100
μg/ml ampicillin (as appropriate), and were similarly
purified by immobilized Ni-ion affinity chromatography,
followed by buffer exchange on Sephadex G-25 (GE
Healthcare).
The multimeric arrangements of the purified, recombinant SXT-Exo and lambda-Exo proteins (100 μl) were
analyzed using a Tricorn Superdex 200 HR 10/300 GL
column on an AKTA-FPLC (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with gel filtration buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl
pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM imidazole);
at a flow-rate of 0.4 ml/min at 4°C, monitoring the eluent at 280 nm. The column was pre-calibrated with the
following protein standards (GE healthcare): ferritin
(440 kDa); aldolase (158 kDa); thyroglobulin (67 kDa);
ovalbumin (43 kDa); chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa) and
ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa).
Qualitative determination of SXT-Exo substrate range,
mode of digestion and metal ion dependence
DNA substrate determination

Assay mixtures (20 μl) containing SXT-Exo (0.6 μg, 5
pmol of trimers) and a DNA substrate: i) undigested
pUC18 (184 ng); ii) PstI-linearized pUC18 (184 ng); iii)
dephosphorylated PstI-linearized pUC18 (184 ng); or iv)
M13-phage ssDNA (TaKaRa, 300 ng, 0.13 pmole) in
Tris-HCl (25 mM, pH7.4), 50 mM NaCl with/without
10 mM MgCl2 (as indicated in the text), were incubated
at 37°C for 30 minutes then quenched (20 mM EDTA).
Aliquots (20 μl) were analysed on 1% TAE agarose gels.
Determination of digestion polarity

A representative linear double stranded DNA substrate
(’unmodified’; 712 bp) was synthesized by PCR using
pET32a as a template, with the primers T7for (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG) and T7rev (GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG). An analogous 712 bp dsDNA
substrate (’PT-modified’) was similarly synthesized by
PCR, using the phosphorothioate modified primers
T7forPT3 (TAATACGACTCACTATA S G S G S G) and
T7revPT3 (GCTAGTTATTGCTCAG S C S G S G), where
the subscript ‘S’ denotes a (nuclease resistant) phosphorothioate linage instead of a normal phosphodiester lingage. Both PCR products were 5’-phosphorylated using
T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB), then purified (QIAquick PCR purification kit) prior to use. The 5’-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/12/16

phosphorylated ‘unmodified’ and ‘PT-modified’ dsDNA
substrates (0.1 mg) were separately incubated at 37°C
with lambda-Exo (3 μg) or SXT-Exo (30 μg) in TrisHCl, (25 mM, pH7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl 2
(total volume 40 μl). Aliquots (20 μl) were quenched (20
mM EDTA + 1% SDS) immediately and after 30 mins,
and analyzed on 1% agarose TAE gels.
Time course analysis

Assay mixtures (250 μl) containing NdeI-linearized
pET28a (1.84 μg, 0.56 pmol) and SXT-Exo (6 μg, 50
pmol of trimers) in Tris-HCl (25 mM, pH7.4), 50 mM
NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2 were incubated at 37°C. Aliquots
(20 μl) were quenched (1% SDS + 20 mM EDTA) at the
times indicated over a 160 min period, then analyzed on
1% agarose TAE gels.
Quantitative determination of double strand DNA
exonuclease activities by quenched PicoGreen fluorescent
assays

The double strand exonuclease activities of SXT-Exo
and lambda-Exo under various conditions were determined by quantifying the amounts of double strand
DNA that remained after enzymatic incubation, using
the PicoGreen DNA fluorescence reagent (Invitrogen,
catalogue # P7589). These quenched PicoGreen fluorescence assays were performed as described previously
[26,43] with minor modifications. All experiments
described below utilized analogous assay procedures,
which were performed in 96-well microtitre plates
(Iwaki 3860-096, Asahi Glass Co., Japan). Four to six
independent replicates were performed for each experimental condition; with graphs showing the mean values
± standard deviation. Unless otherwise stated, assays (48
μl) contained SXT-Exo protein (2 pmol of trimers) in
exonuclease buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH7.4, 50 mM
NaCl, 0.5 mM MnCl 2 ). Assays were initiated by the
addition of 2 μl of a solution of the DNA substrate, typically PstI-linearized pUC18 (5 ng, 0.003 pmol), in exonuclease buffer; and were incubated at 37°C for 30
mins, before quenching by the addition of EDTA to a
final concentration of 20 mM. PicoGreen reagent was
then added (250-fold dilution) and fluorescence levels
were immediately measured (excitation 485 nm/emission 535 nm) using a Perkin Elmer 1420 multi-label
counter. The degree of dsDNA digestion was determined using: (N-R)/(N-P); where N = fluorescence reading for the starting DNA concentration; R =
fluorescence reading at the quenched time point; P =
fluorescence reading obtained for half of the concentration of linear dsDNA substrate used in the assay, which
had been heat-denatured (P is an approximation of the
digestion end-point; for most assays, P = fluorescent

reading for 2.5 ng of heat-denatured PstI-linearized
pUC18 in 50 μl of exonuclease buffer).
Determination of optimal conditions for SXT-Exo double
strand DNA exonuclease activities

Quenched PicoGreen fluorescence assays were performed, quenched and analyzed as described above with
minor modifications. Determination of optimal Mg 2+
and Mn2+ ion concentrations: Assays (50 μl) contained
SXT-Exo (2 pmol of trimers), PstI-linearized pUC18
(5 ng, 0.003 pmol) in Tris-HCl (25 mM, pH7.4), 50 mM
NaCl containing MnCl 2 (0-10 mM) or MgCl 2 (050 mM) at the concentrations indicated in the text; and
were incubated at 37°C for 30 mins. Determination of
optimal pH: Assays (50 μl) contained SXT-Exo (2 pmol
of trimers), PstI-linearized pUC18 (5 ng, 0.003 pmol),
50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MnCl2; adjusted
to the appropriate pH value (pH7.0 - pH9.0); and were
incubated at 37°C for 30 mins. Determination of optimal
temperature: Assays (50 μl) contained SXT-Exo (6 pmol
of trimers), PstI-linearized pUC18 (5 ng, 0.003 pmol) in
exonuclease buffer. All solutions were pre-equilibrated at
the temperature indicated in the text (31-47°C) using a
thermostat-regulated water bath; an incubation time of 1
minute was used. Effects of adding various concentrations of monovalent or divalent metal cations: Assays (50
μl) contained SXT-Exo (2 pmol of trimers), PstI-linearized pUC18 (5 ng, 0.003 pmol) in Tris-HCl (25 mM,
pH7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MnCl2; as well as the salt
indicated in the text (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, Na2SO4, K2SO4
or Na 2 HPO 4 ; to a final concentration between 0-500
mM); and were incubated at 37°C for 30 mins. The relative dsDNA exonuclease activities were calculated (as a
percentage) by comparison with results from analogous
assays that contained: SXT-Exo (2 pmol of trimers), PstIlinearized pUC18 (5 ng, 0.003 pmol) in Tris-HCl
(25 mM, pH7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MnCl2.
Double strand DNA end preference

Assay mixtures contained SXT-Exo (12 pmol of trimers)

The 50Cy3 (CAgTCACgACgTTgTAAAACgACggCCAgTgCCAAgCTTgCATgCCTgCA-Cy3) and 70Cy3
(TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCAgTCACgACgTTgTAAAACgACggCCAgTgCCAAgCTTgCATgCCTgCACy3) oligonucleotides both contain Cy3 fluorescent groups
at their 3’-termini, and were phosphorylated at their 5’-termini using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, then purified
(Qiaquick PCR purification kit, Qiagen). The 50blunt
(TgCAggCATgCAAgCTTggCACTggCCgTCgTTTTACAACgTCgTgACTg) and 70overhang (TgCAggCATgCAAgCTTggCACTggCCgTCgTTTTACAACgTCgTgACTgTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT) oligonucleotides
do not contain 3’-Cy3 groups, and were not 5’-phosphorylated. Three partially double stranded DNA substrates
were prepared by thermally annealing various oligonucleotide pairs: “Blunt ended” = 5’-PO4-50Cy3 + 50blunt; “5’overhang” = 5’-PO4-70Cy3 + 50blunt; and “3’-overhang” =
5’-PO4-50Cy3 + 70overhang (see Additional File 4 Panel
B). With the careful exclusion of light, equimolar amounts
of each oligonucleotide in millipure water were heated to
100°C for 5 minutes, then allowed to cool slowly to room
temperature. Substrates were used without further purification. Exonuclease assays: Reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained: i) SXT-Exo (50 pmol of trimers), Tris-HCl (50
mM, pH 8.0), 0.5 mM MnCl2, and 20 pmol of one of the
Blunt ended, 5’-overhang or 3-overhang annealed oligonucleotide substrates; or ii) lambda-Exo (3 pmol of trimers)
in Tris-HCl (50 mM, pH 8.0), 5 mM MgCl2, and 20 pmol
of one of the Blunt ended, 5’-overhang or 3’-overhang
annealed oligonucleotide substrates. Assays were incubated at 25°C, and 10 μl aliquots were withdrawn and
quenched with 40 μl of gel loading buffer (50 mM Tris
pH8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 8 M urea, 20% glycerol) at
the times indicated in the text (0-20 minutes for SXT-Exo;
0-10 minutes for lambda-Exo). Samples were stored on ice
in the dark prior to resolution on denaturing polyacrylamide gels [7 M urea-TBE polyacrylamide (12%, 37.5:1)].
Gels were scanned for fluorescence using a Typhoon™
9410 Variable Mode Imager (excitation 532 nm/emission
580 nm). Band intensities on the scanned gel images were
quantified using Quantity One software (BioRad) to calculate the degree of digestion of the (annealed) 5’-PO 4 70Cy3 or 5’-PO4-50Cy3 oligonucleotides. Data were fitted
to hyperbolae using Origin v7.5 SR1. Figures show the

pmol; 4 pmol; 2 pmol; 1 pmol; 0.5 pmol; 0.25 pmol; 0.125

polyacrylamide gels, and analogously scanned for

Determination of exonuclease processivity and rate

The procedure used was analogous to that previously
described by Myers and co-workers [24,26]. SXT-Exo
(41 nmol of trimers) and PstI-linearized pUC18 DNA
(30 ng, 18.1 pmol) in 150 μl of Tris-HCl (25 mM,
pH7.4), 50 mM NaCl were pre-incubated for 5 mins at
25°C. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 50 μl
of Tris-HCl (25 mM, pH7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM
MnCl 2 (making the final concentration of Mn 2+ ions
0.5 mM) and were incubated at 25°C. After 30 s,
unbound SXT-Exo was ‘trapped’ by the addition of
heparin (150 μg; Sigma, Cat. #H3393) in exonuclease
buffer (100 μl). 50 μl aliquots were withdrawn at various
time points (0-30 mins) and quenched with EDTA
(20 mM). Levels of dsDNA were immediately quantified
using PicoGreen reagent as described above. Analogous
control experiments using a ‘trapping’ buffer without
heparin (i.e. 100 μl of exonuclease buffer) were performed. The number of nucleotides digested was determined by calculating the percentage of DNA substrate
digested at each time point, then multiplying this value
by 1343; which is the number of nucleotides available
for digestion per DNA strand on the linearized (2686
bp) pUC18 molecule, assuming digestion occurs from
both termini. Four independent replicates of each
experiment were conducted, and graphs show the mean
values ± standard deviation. To obtain the processivity
and initial rate of DNA digestion at 25°C, data from the
heparin trap experiments was fitted to a hyperbola using
Origin v7.5 SR1 as previously described [24].
Protein-mediated modulation of the double stranded
DNA exonuclease activities of SXT-Exo and lambda-Exo

SXT-Exo (2 pmol of trimers), and 2 pmol of the protein
indicated in the text [BSA (Sigma), SXT-Bet, SXT-Ssb
or lambda-Bet] in 48 μl of exonuclease buffer were incubated at 25°C for 5 mins. PstI-linearized pUC18 (5 ng,
0.003 pmol) in 2 μl of exonuclease buffer was added to
initiate the reaction, incubating assays at 25°C for 30
mins before quenching (20 mM EDTA). Levels of
dsDNA were immediately quantified using PicoGreen
reagent as described above. In analogous experiments,
lambda-Exo (2 pmol of trimers) and 2 pmol of the protein indicated in the text [BSA, SXT-Bet, SXT-Ssb or
lambda-Bet], in 48 μl of Tris-HCl (25 mM, pH7.4),
50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 were incubated at 25°C for
5 mins. PstI-linearized pUC18 (5 ng, 0.003 pmol) in 2 μl
of Tris-HCl (25 mM, pH7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM
MgCl 2 was added to initiate the reaction, incubating
assays at 25°C for 10 mins before quenching and analyzing dsDNA levels using PicoGreen reagent. Six

replicates of each experiment were performed, and data
was analyzed using ANOVA (SPSS software package).
Figures show the mean values ± standard deviation,
with corresponding P values indicated (compared to
control reaction where no protein was added).
Oligonucleotide exonuclease assays

A 75-mer of oligothymidine (dT75) was used directly, or
where applicable, was phosphorylated at the 5’-terminus
(5’-P-dT75) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Assays
(250 μl) containing dT 75 or 5’-P-dT 75 (400 pmol) in
Tris-HCl (25 mM, pH7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2
were initiated by the addition of SXT-Exo (100 pmol of
trimers). Reactions were quenched immediately (20 mM
EDTA) or after incubation at 37°C for 3 or 25 minutes.
Protein was removed after precipitation by consecutive
heating (100°C, 10 mins), cooling (4°C, 10 mins), and
centrifugation (15.6 kg, 5 mins). Supernatant (100 μl)
was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography using a
Tricorn Superdex 200 HR 10/300 GL column pre-equilibrated with 25 mM Tris-HCl pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1
mM EDTA; at a flow-rate of 0.4 ml/min at 4°C, monitoring the elution of oligonucleotides at 254 nm. A standard curve for dT75 was constructed (loading 10, 20, 40,
60 or 80 nmoles of oligonucleotide onto the gel filtration column under analogous conditions; see Additional
File 4 Panel A). The area under the main peak on the
gel filtration chromatogram (elution volume 12.9 ml),
was proportional to the amount of dT75 present.
Determination of double strand DNA recombination
activities

A chloramphenicol resistance (Cmr) cassette was PCRamplified from plasmid pEGFP-loxP-CmR-loxP [44]
using primers ECgalKF1 (GTTTGCGCGCAGTCAGCGATATCCATTTTCGCGAATCCGGAGTGTAAGAATAAAAATAGGCGTATCACGAG) and ECgalKR1
(TTCATATTGTTCAGCGACAGCTTGCTGTACGGCAGGCACCAGCTCTTCCGTAGTGAACCTCTTCGAGGGAC), to create a dsDNA molecule (Cm<>galK)
that contained 50 bp flanking regions with sequence
homologous to the 5’- and 3’-ends of the E. coli galK
gene (underlined in the two primer sequences; see Figure 11 Panel A). These primers were analogous to those
previously described by Yu et al. [38], which were used
to perform analogous galK gene targeting experiments
with the lambda-Red proteins. The Cm<>galK PCR product was gel-purified (Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit, Qiagen); DNA was eluted from the spin column with 1 mM
Tris-HCl (pH8.0). Plasmids pBAD-ETg, pB1E4A,
pBex4b1, pBX2B and pBAD-28MCS were separately
transformed into E. coli DH10B by electroporation. Individual transformant colonies (LB-agar + ampicillin 50

μg/ml) were inoculated into LB medium containing 50
μg/ml ampicillin (5 ml), which were incubated with
shaking at 37°C overnight. Aliquots from the overnight
cultures were expanded 1:100 in fresh LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin (50 ml in 250 ml conical
flasks), and were incubated with shaking (37°C, 60
mins). Expression was induced by the addition of filtersterilized aqueous arabinose solution (10% w/v) to a
final concentration of 0.1%, and flasks were incubated
with shaking (37°C, 60 mins). Flasks were then rapidly
chilled in ice-water (with swirling) for 20 minutes, cultures were decanted into pre-chilled 50 ml Falcon tubes,
and cells were pelleted by centrifugation (4000 g, 10
mins, 1-3°C). After carefully decanting the medium, cell
pellets were gently washed with ice-cold sterile water
(40 ml), and centrifuged as before. Washed cell pellets
were resuspended in ice-cold sterile water (190 μl) and
transferred to pre-chilled 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes
placed in wet-ice. The purified Cm<>galK dsDNA targeting cassette (1.18 μg) was added to each tube, and
after 2-3 minutes, aliquots of the resuspended cell pellets (2 × 90 μl) were pipetted into (pre-chilled) electroporation cuvettes placed on ice. Immediately after
electroporation (1.8 kV), LB medium (1 ml, no antibiotics) was added to the electroporation cuvettes, and the
resuspended cell mixtures were transferred to 1.5 ml
microcentrifuge tubes, and were allowed to recover (37°
C, 90 mins). A 10 μl aliquot was removed, diluted
1:10,000 in LB media then plated onto LB-agar in order
to calculate the surviving cell count. The remaining ca.
1 ml of transformed cell suspension was centrifuged
(12,000 g, 1 min) then the entire cell pellet was plated
onto LB-agar containing 12 μg/ml chloramphenicol.
Agar plates were incubated at 37°C for 16 hours prior
to colony counting. The recombination efficiency was
calculated by dividing the number of chloramphenicolresistant colonies by the number cells surviving electroporation (colony forming units). 10 Cm-resistant colonies from each plate were screened by PCR, to check
that the Cm r cassette had been chromosomally-integrated in the correct manner. All experiments were performed in duplicate, and repeated 4 times (8 replicates).
Errors were calculated on the mean values ± standard
deviation.

Results
SXT-Exo forms a trimer analogous to lambda-Exo

The SXT-exo (s066), SXT-bet (s065) and SXT-ssb (s064)
genes were cloned into pET28a vectors (Novagen) and
expressed in E. coli as 20 amino acid N-terminal T7hexahistidine fusions (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGS
HM...). The bet and exo genes from bacteriophage
lambda were cloned into pET32a vectors (Novagen) and
expressed in E. coli as 8aa C-terminal hexahistidine

fusions (...LEHHHHHH*). All five of the recombinant
His-tagged proteins were purified by immobilized Niaffinity chromatography followed by desalting, and were
determined to be 95-99% pure by SDS-PAGE (Figure 1
panel C). With the exception of SXT-Exo, the purified
recombinant proteins all exhibited good long-term physical stability in a variety of buffer systems (data not
shown). Consequently, all experiments involving SXTExo were performed using batches of freshly-expressed
and purified protein.
The multimericity of the recombinant SXT-Exo and
lambda-Exo proteins were determined using size exclusion chromatography (Figure 1). Two peaks were apparent in the SXT-Exo chromatogram (Panel A). SDSPAGE analysis of eluted fractions corresponding to both
peaks confirmed that they contained only SXT-Exo protein (data not shown). The minor peak (eluting at 7.9
ml) corresponded to a molecular weight of ca. 1350
kDa, which equated to ca. 33 SXT-Exo monomers. The
major peak (eluting at 12.9 ml) correlated to a molecular weight of 145 kDa, which corresponded to ca. 3.5
SXT-Exo monomers. Lambda-Exo eluted at 13.8 ml
(Panel B), correlating to a molecular weight of 91 kDa,
which corresponded to 3.35 protein monomers. This
indicated that the recombinant lambda-Exo and SXTExo proteins both formed stable trimers in solution,
with no monomeric forms detected. This strongly suggests that SXT-Exo adopts a ‘doughnut-shaped’ homotrimeric arrangement analogous to that of lambda-Exo
[19]. The torroidal trimers of both these two proteins
possibly migrate faster through the gel-filtration column
due to their flattened, non-spherical topology (i.e. larger
Stokes radius). The high molecular weight, soluble
aggregation of ca. 33 SXT-Exo protein monomers is
most likely an artefact due to heterologous over-expression in E. coli, and is probably not biologically relevant.
Consequently, in all subsequent biochemical assays, the
concentrations of the SXT-Exo and lambda-Exo proteins
were reported in terms of moles of trimers, as this is
most likely the active form of both exonucleases.
Qualitative determination of SXT-Exo nuclease activities

The lambda-Exo and SPP1-Chu proteins essentially
require a divalent metal ion cofactor for exonuclease
activities [17,26,27]. Therefore, we first investigated the
ability of SXT-Exo to digest linear dsDNA in the presence of millimolar concentrations of various divalent
metal ions (Mg2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Ni2+,
Fe2+). Results indicated that only Mn2+ and Mg2+ ions
could function as cofactors for the dsDNA exonuclease
activities of SXT-Exo (data not shown). We then investigated the substrate range of SXT-Exo, determining its
ability to digest a variety of linear and (covalentlyclosed) circular double stranded and single stranded

DNA molecules. A large excess of SXT-Exo protein was
incubated with undigested pUC18 plasmid DNA to
determine whether it had the ability to nick or cleave
covalently closed circular dsDNA molecules (Figure 2,
Panel A; lanes 6 and 7). Results clearly indicated that
SXT-Exo had no endonuclease or nicking activities.
Similarly, incubation with M13-phage DNA (Panel A,
lanes 8 and 9) demonstrated that SXT-Exo could not
cleave circularized ssDNA. In these respects, SXT-Exo
has substrate specificities analogous to those of SPP1Chu and lambda-Exo [17,21,22,26,27].
Aliquots from a time-course analysis of the SXT-Exo
mediated digestion of NdeI-linearized pET28a are
shown in Figure 2, Panel C. It could be seen that the
concentration of linear dsDNA molecules decreased
steadily over time (i.e. there was a gradual decrease in
fluorescence intensity), but their sizes remained relatively unchanged. This finding was consistent with SXTExo digesting dsDNA with significant processivity; i.e. it
sequentially hydrolyzed numerous nucleotides from each
termini without dissociation of the protein from the
DNA chain.
Nikiforov et al. have previously shown that the 5’- to
3’-exonuclease activities of the T7 gene 6 protein could
be effectively inhibited by the incorporation of phoshorothioate groups into the DNA backbone, in place of
‘natural’ phosphodiester linkages [45]. We used an analogous approach to determine the digestion polarity of
the SXT-Exo exonuclease (Figure 2, Panel B). A PCRbased strategy was used to synthesize a 5’-phosphorylated linear double stranded DNA substrate (’PT-modified’, 712 bp in length) containing 3 consecutive
‘nuclease resistant’ phosphorothioate linkages near the
5’-termini was synthesized. An analogous 5’-phosphorylated linear dsDNA molecule without phosphorothioate
modifications (’unmodified’) was similarly prepared. As
the phosphorothioate linkages are only present near the
5’-termini of each strand of the DNA duplex in the ‘PTmodified’ substrate, they should not interfere with the
activities of an exonuclease with 3’- to 5’-polarity. However, an enzyme with 5’- to 3’-polarity should be significantly inhibited. Lambda-Exo and SXT-Exo were
separately incubated with these two DNA substrates
(37°C, 30 mins) and their digestion products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis (Figure 2, Panel B). Negligible amounts of the ‘PT-modified’ linear dsDNA
substrate were digested by SXT-Exo under the conditions used (lane 5), whereas the ‘unmodified’ linear
dsDNA substrate was fully digested (lane 3). Under analogous conditions, lambda-Exo completely-digested the

37°C with lambda-Exo (3 μg) or SXT-Exo (30 μg) in Tris-HCl, (25

‘unmodified’ dsDNA substrate (lane 7) but only digested
a small amount of the phosphorothioate modified
dsDNA (lane 9). This clearly indicated that SXT-Exo
digests linear dsDNA with 5’- to 3’-polarity, analogous
to the lambda-Exo and SPP1-Chu proteins [17,27].
Quantitative determination of SXT-Exo double strand
DNA exonuclease activities using the sensitive fluorescent
PicoGreen reagent

We quantified the dsDNA exonuclease activities of
SXT-Exo under a variety of different experimental conditions using sensitive fluorescence assays incorporating
the PicoGreen reagent (Invitrogen). This approach has
previously been utilized by Myers and co-workers to dissect the activities of lambda-Exo and SPP1-Chu
(G34.1P) [24,26,43]. The PicoGreen reagent fluoresces
intensely when complexed with double stranded DNA,
but exhibits very low fluorescence levels in the presence
of free nucleotides or single stranded DNA chains [43].
Using this reagent, it is possible to accurately quantify
the amount of dsDNA that has been enzymaticallydigested. Purified PstI-linearized pUC18 DNA (2686 bp

Page 10 of 21

in length) was used as a representative linear dsDNA
substrate for all PicoGreen assays.
As our initial results had indicated that SXT-Exo
essentially required Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ ions for catalytic
activity, we first used quenched PicoGreen fluorescence
assays to determine which concentrations these divalent
metal ions were optimal for its dsDNA exonuclease
activities (Figure 3). Results indicated that Mn 2+ was
optimal at 2.5 mM (Panel B), whilst Mg 2+ was most
effectively utilized at 30 mM (Panel A). At optimal Mg2
+
and Mn2+ concentrations, the rates of dsDNA exonuclease activities were equivalent (within experimental
error). Analogous sets of PicoGreen assays were then
used to characterize the dsDNA exonuclease activities of
SXT-Exo between pH 7.0 and 9.0. DNA digestion rates
formed a skewed bell-shaped distribution between these
pH values, with an optimum at pH 8.2 (Figure 3, Panel
C). Activities fell-off markedly above pH 8.5. The operational temperature range for the SXT-Exo protein was
similarly investigated. Its dsDNA exonuclease activities
increased steadily between 31 and 41°C, reached a
maximum at ca. 42°C, then dropped-off sharply at

determined by quenched PicoGreen Assays. Panel A: Optimum Mg2+ ion concentrations. SXT-Exo (2 pmol of trimers) in Tris-HCl (25 mM,

experimental procedures.

temperatures higher than this (Figure 3, panel D). SXTExo was essentially inactive at 47°C.
Inhibition of SXT-Exo dsDNA exonuclease activities by
phosphate and various inorganic salts

To gain a better understanding of other factors influencing the biochemical activities of SXT-Exo, we systematically investigated how the addition of various inorganic
salts affected its ability to digest linear dsDNA (PstI-linearized pUC18). Analogous sets of quenched PicoGreen
fluorescence assays were used to determine the relative
effects of sodium (Na + ), potassium (K + ) and calcium
(Ca 2+ ) cations; as well as chloride (Cl - ), phosphate
(PO 4 3- ) and sulfate (SO 4 2- ) anions. Phosphate ions
strongly inhibited the dsDNA exonuclease activities of
SXT-Exo, with sodium phosphate having an IC50 of 25
mM (Figure 4, Panel A). This may be due to competition for the DNA internucleotide phosphodiester group
binding sites within the protein trimer, or may possibly
be due to interference with the putative protein binding
site for the 5’-PO4 group at the terminus of the DNA
strand being digested [24]. Electrostatic effects or divalent metal ion chelation effects (reducing the pool of
free Mg 2+ or Mn2+ ions available to the protein) may
also play a role. Sulfate ions similarly inhibited SXT-Exo
at concentrations above ca. 10 mM; with sodium sulfate
having an IC50 of ca. 20 mM, and potassium sulfate having an IC50 of ca. 35 mM (Figure 4, Panels A and B). Its
mode of inhibition may be analogous to that of phosphate, as this anion contains a roughly-similar geometrical arrangement of oxygen atoms around a central nonmetal atom.

Page 11 of 21

The dsDNA exonuclease activities of SXT-Exo steadily
decreased with increasing concentrations of Na+ and K+
ions, but were only significantly inhibited at concentrations above ca. 200-300 mM (Figure 4, Panels A and B).
This general inhibitory effect by Na + and K + ions at
high concentration appears to be common to most, if
not all related exonucleases, but the reported inhibitory
sensitivities vary significantly, e.g. see references [46-51].
At the concentration used in the standard exonuclease
buffer (50 mM), NaCl appeared to have negligible inhibitory or stimulatory effects. Notably however, potassium ions stimulated enzymatic activities 20% at
concentrations between 50-100 mM. Baylis et al. [46]
and Stolzenberg and Ooka [47] similarly noted that the
BGL5 alkaline exonuclease from Epstein-Barr virus had
optimal activities in the presence of ca. 50 mM of potassium or sodium ions. 100 mM CaCl 2 almost entirely
inhibited SXT-Exo dsDNA exonuclease activities (IC50
ca. 75 mM, Figure 4 Panel B). By analogy with structural
observations previously noted for lambda-Exo [19], and
the fact that calcium ions also inhibit the RecE [52] and
RecBC exonucleases [53], it appears most likely that Ca2
+
inhibits SXT-Exo via direct competition with the divalent metal ion (Mg2+ or Mn2+) binding sites.
DNA substrate preferences

Having determined how various chemical and physical
parameters affect the dsDNA activities of the SXT-Exo
protein, we next focussed on characterizing its DNA
substrate preferences in a quantitative manner. Sets of
PicoGreen assays analogous to those described above
were used to investigate the rates at which SXT-Exo

by quenched PicoGreen assays. Panel A: Inhibition of the dsDNA exonuclease activities of SXT-Exo with sodium chloride (black squares),
sodium phosphate (buffered to pH7.4; red circles) and sodium sulfate (blue triangles). SXT-Exo (2 pmol of trimers), PstI-linearized pUC18 (5 ng,
0.003 pmol) in Tris-HCl (25 mM, pH7.4), 0.5 mM MnCl2; as well as the salt indicated in the figure (NaCl, Na2HPO4 (pH7.4), or Na2SO4; 0-500 mM);
were incubated at 37°C for 30 mins. Panel B: Inhibition of the dsDNA exonuclease activities of SXT-Exo with potassium chloride (black squares),
calcium chloride (red squares) and potassium sulfate (blue triangles). SXT-Exo (2 pmol of trimers), PstI-linearized pUC18 (5 ng, 0.003 pmol) in TrisHCl (25 mM, pH7.4), 0.5 mM MnCl2; as well as the salt indicated in the figure (KCl, CaCl2 or K2SO4; 0-500 mM); were incubated at 37°C for 30
mins. Relative dsDNA exonuclease activities were calculated (as a percentage) by comparison with results from analogous assays that contained:
SXT-Exo (2 pmol of trimers), PstI-linearized pUC18 (5 ng, 0.003 pmol) in Tris-HCl (25 mM, pH7.4), 0.5 mM MnCl2, 50 mM NaCl. Graphs show the
the mean values ± standard deviation. See methods for detailed experimental procedures.

digested linear dsDNA molecules containing different
types of ends (see Figure 5). Blunt-ended linear dsDNA
substrates, as well as ones containing small (4 nucleotide) 3’- or 5’-ssDNA overhangs at each terminus, were
prepared by digesting pUC18 plasmid DNA with the
SspI, PstI or BamHI restriction enzymes, respectively.
Linear dsDNA molecules containing short 5’-ssDNA
overhangs at each termini (un-shaded triangles)
appeared to be digested ca. 30-50% faster during the
initial phase of incubation with SXT-Exo (0-5 minutes)
than corresponding blunt-ended substrates, or ones containing short 3’-overhangs (black shaded circles). However, after ca. 10 minutes this initial effect was
compensated for; and after 40 minutes there were no
significant differences in the overall percentages of linear
dsDNA substrate consumed. Notably, SXT-Exo digested
PstI-linearized pUC18 (black shaded circles) ca. 20-fold
more effectively than 5’-dephosphorylated PstI-linearized
pUC18 (un-shaded circles). This demonstrated that
SXT-Exo had a strong preference for linear dsDNA
molecules that contained 5’-phosphorylated ends, compared with ones that had lacked 5’-phosphate groups.
To determine whether SXT-Exo had ssDNA ‘trimming’ activity [21,23] we investigated its ability to
digest both non-phosphorylated and 5’-phosphorylated

Figure 5 Double stranded DNA end preferences of SXT-Exo.
SXT-Exo (2 pmol of trimers) in Tris-HCl (25 mM, pH7.4), 0.5 mM
MnCl2, 50 mM NaCl; was incubated at 37°C for 30 mins with: i) 5’phosphorylated linear dsDNA with 4 nt 3’-overhangs (PstI-linearized
pUC18, black shaded circles); ii) 5’-hydroxylated linear dsDNA with 4
nt 3’-overhangs (dephosphorylated PstI-linerarized pUC18, unshaded circles); iii) 5’-phosphorylated blunt-ended dsDNA (SspIlinerized pUC18, shaded inverted triangles); or iv) 5’-phosphorylated
linear dsDNA with 4 nt 5’-overhangs (BamHI-linearized pUC18, unshaded green triangles). Aliquots were removed at 1, 2, 5, 10, 20
and 40 minutes; quenched, then dsDNA levels were quantified
using the PicoGreen reagent. Graphs show the the mean values ±
standard deviation. See methods for detailed experimental
procedures.

forms of a synthetic 75 mer of oligothymidine (dT 75
and 5’-P-dT75, respectively). SXT-Exo (100 pmol of trimers) was incubated with 400 pmol of dT 75 or 5’-PdT 75 in Tris-HCl buffer (pH7.4) containing 10 mM
MgCl2 at 37°C. Reactions were quenched immediately
(0 min), as well as after 3 minutes and 25 minutes;
then products were analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography. This enabled both the length (retention
time) and concentration (peak area) of oligonucleotide
reaction products to be determined. Overlays of the
three chromatograms obtained for reaction products
formed at the three time points are shown in Figure 6
(Panel A, dT75 ; Panel B, 5’-P-dT75 ). Various amounts
of oligo-dT 75 (10-80 nmoles) were analogously analyzed using gel filtration chromatography, to confirm
that the area under the main peak eluting at 12.9 ml
on the chromatogram was proportional to the amount
of oligonucleotide present (Additional File 4, Panel A).
Under the conditions used, SXT-Exo digested 13% and
40% of the dT75 substrate after 3 minutes and 25 minutes, respectively (Panel A). In the corresponding set
of reactions, 37% and 63% of the 5’-P-dT75 substrate
was digested after 3 minutes and 25 minutes, respectively (Panel B). This revealed that SXT-Exo had a ca.
1.5- to 3-fold preference for 5’-phosphorylated ends
under the conditions tested. It may be noted on both
chromatograms, that the height of the shoulder peaks
did not concomitantly increase as the main peak
decreased, and no additional peaks with longer retention times appeared. This revealed that SXT-Exo
digested both the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of the oligothymidine 75-mer without the
production of significant amounts of shorter chain
length products. This observation is consistent with
SXT-Exo hydrolyzing ssDNA with a certain level of
processivity.
To further dissect the dsDNA-end preferences of the
SXT-Exo protein, three (partially) double stranded substrates were created by annealing (partially) complementary pairs of oligonucleotides (see Additional File 4,
Panel B). One of the annealed oligonucleotides in each
substrate was phosphorylated at its 5’-termini and fluorescently-labelled at its 3’-termini with the Cy3 group
(indicated with an orange-coloured asterisk in Figures 7
and 8). This enabled the digestion of this DNA strand
to be followed by fluorescence scanning of denaturing
polyacrylamide gels (with the other strand being ‘invisible’). The “Blunt ended” substrate comprised a 50 bp
fully double stranded ‘core’ region; the “5’-overhang”
substrate contained the ‘core’ dsDNA region and a 5’overhang of 20 thymidine residues; and the “3’-overhang” substrate contained a 3’-overhang of 20 thymidine
residues (which may also be referred to as a 5’-recessed
end). The composition of our exonuclease substrates are

similar to those previously used by Mitsis and Kwagh
[54] for their characterization of lambda-Exo.
SXT-Exo (50 pmol of trimers) was separately incubated with 20 pmol of each of the annealed oligonucleotide substrates at 25°C for 20 minutes (Figure 7).
Aliquots were periodically removed, quenched, and then
resolved on denaturing-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were
fluorescently-scanned, and the intensities of the bands
that corresponded to the Cy3-labeled oligos were quantified to determine the percentage of substrate digested
at each time point (Panel D). Four replicates were performed; and representative gel images are shown in
Panels A, B and C. Standard curves were constructed
for both Cy3-labelled oligos used, to confirm that their
fluorescence intensities were linear over the range of
concentrations used (Additional File 4, Panels C and D).
Results indicated that SXT-Exo digested DNA substrates
containing 5’-recessed ends (3’-overhangs; shaded
inverted triangles) or blunt-ends (un-shaded circles)
with roughly equal efficiencies (52% and 48% digested,
respectively; see Figure 7 Panel D). Both were digested
roughly 2-fold more effectively than ones containing 5’overhangs (shaded circles, 26% digested). Furthermore,
it may be noted that the intensities of the bands on the
gel corresponding to the 5’-phosphorylated-3’-fluorescently labelled oligonucleotides (5’-PO 4 -70Cy3 or 5’PO4-50Cy3) decreased with increasing time, but their
size remained essentially constant. This indicated that
this strand of the (partial) duplex was being digested by
SXT-Exo in the 5’- to 3’-direction, in an apparently processive manner.
Analogous sets of experiments were performed with
recombinant lambda-Exo protein (Figure 8); except

using fewer molar equivalents of enzyme (3 pmol of trimers) and a shorter incubation time (10 minutes).
Lambda-Exo digested the DNA substrates containing 5’recessed ends (shaded inverted triangles) and blunt-ends
(un-shaded circles) with roughly equal efficiencies (66%
and 60% digested, respectively; see Figure 8 Panel D).
Both of these DNA substrates were digested roughly
twice as effectively as ones containing 5’-overhangs
(shaded circles, 37% digested). Our findings are entirely
consistent with the results reported by Mitsis and
Kwagh [54]. Taken together, these experiments clearly
demonstrated that the lambda-Exo and SXT-Exo proteins digested this set of (partially) dsDNA substrates in
an analogous manner; with both proteins exhibiting
equivalent substrate preferences.
Processivity and rate of double strand DNA digestion by
SXT-Exo

The processivity of the SXT-Exo enzyme was determined using a ‘heparin trap’ method [55]. This approach
was previously used by Myers and co-workers to characterize the processivity of the lambda-Exo and SPP1-Chu
proteins [24,26]. A ca. 2000-fold molar excess of SXTExo trimers was incubated with the linear double
stranded DNA substrate (PstI-linearized pUC18 with 5’phosphorylated ends), to ensure that both termini were
saturated. After allowing 30 seconds for initiation of
reaction, a large excess of heparin was added to sequester all unbound enzyme, to ensure that we were monitoring ‘single-binding’ digestion events; i.e. determining
the average number of nucleotides digested by an
‘active’ SXT-Exo trimer before dissociation. Under the
conditions employed (Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.5 mM MnCl2,

Figure 7 Digestion of fluorescently-labeled annealed
oligonucleotide substrates by SXT-Exo. The ability of SXT-Exo to
digest three different (partially) dsDNA substrates (prepared from
two annealed oligonucleotides, see Additional File 4) was
monitored by quantifying the digestion of the 5’-phosphorylated-3’Cy3-labeled strand using fluorescence gel scanning. In each assay,
SXT-Exo (50 pmol of trimers) was incubated at 25°C with 20 pmol
of the dsDNA substrate in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 0.5 mM MnCl2.
Aliquots were removed and quenched at 0, 1, 2, 4, 10 and 20
minutes; then analyzed on 7 M urea-TBE denaturing polyacrylamide
gels (times indicated above lanes). Gels were scanned for
fluorescence, and fluorescence intensities of the bands
corresponding to the Cy3-labeled strand were quantified. Panel A:

25°C), the processivity of SXT-Exo was estimated to be
746 ± 55 nucleotides (un-shaded circles, Figure 9). Analogous control experiments were performed (no heparin
trap) to quantify the DNA digested by equivalent
amounts of SXT-Exo during multiple protein binding
events; i.e. including further digestion of partiallydigested DNA substrates by re-associated SXT-Exo trimers. Under these conditions 1137 ± 85 nucleotides
were digested in 30 minutes (shaded circles, Figure 9).

analogous to those described for SXT-Exo (see Figure 7), the ability

incubated at 25°C with 20 pmol of the dsDNA substrate in 50 mM
Tris-HCl pH8.0, 5 mM MgCl2. Aliquots were removed and quenched
at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 10 minutes; then analyzed on 7 M urea-TBE

were scanned for fluorescence, and fluorescence intensities of the
bands corresponding to the Cy3-labeled strand were quantified.

SXT-Exo protein trimers, the heparin trap data was also
used to determine the initial (maximal) rate of digestion.
Fitting the data to a hyperbola [24], the rate of SXT-Exo
mediated digestion of PstI-linearized pUC18 DNA was
gauged to be ca. 7 nt per second.
Protein-mediated modulation of the double stranded

Further sets of quenched PicoGreen assays (analogous
to those described above) were used to determine
whether the presence of equimolar amounts of the
SXT-Bet or SXT-Ssb proteins had any effects on the
rate by which SXT-Exo could digest a linear dsDNA
molecule (PstI-linearized pUC18). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was included as a control, as it is commonly

DNA. Heparin-trap experiments were used to calculate the average

30 s, before trapping unbound protein by addition of a large excess
of heparin. Aliquots were removed at 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30
minutes; quenched, then dsDNA levels immediately quantified using
PicoGreen assays to determine the number of nucleotides digested
from each end (red circles) at each time point. Analogous control
experiments without heparin were performed (black circles). Four
independent replicates of each experiment were conducted, and

section for details.

found to enhance protein stability in solution (e.g.
restriction enzymes [56]), but would not be predicted to
exhibit any protein-specific effects with SXT-Exo. As
may be seen in Figure 10, Panel A, the presence of
SXT-Bet or SXT-Ssb enhanced the activities of SXTExo ca. 2.2-fold or 3.2-fold, respectively. This may be
compared to a ca. 1.8-fold increase of dsDNA exonuclease activities when equimolar amounts of BSA were
added. Intriguingly, the addition of lambda-Bet protein
stimulated the activities of SXT-Exo nearly 8-fold. Analogous experiments were performed using the lambdaExo protein, in place of SXT-Exo (see Figure 10, panel
B). Similar results were obtained. BSA stimulated the
activities of lambda-Exo ca. 1.2-fold, whilst lambda-Bet
stimulated its activities ca. 3.3-fold. SXT-Bet and SXTSsb enhanced the dsDNA exonuclease activities of
lambda-Exo ca. 3.4-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively. The
effects of adding different molar ratios of SSAP or Ssb
proteins to SXT-Exo or lambda-Exo were not
determined.
DNA recombination activities of SXT-Bet and SXT-Exo

In order to evaluate whether the SXT-Bet and Exo proteins had the combined ability to promote homologous
DNA recombination, a non-essential gene on the E. coli

Page 15 of 21

chromosome (galK) was targeted for allelic replacement
with a PCR-generated dsDNA chloramphenicol resistance cassette (galK<>Cmr). An analogous approach was
previously used by Yu et al. [38], to determine the
dsDNA recombination activities of the lambda-GamBet-Exo proteins (the lambda-Red system), expressed
from a modified prophage element in the DY380 strain
of E. coli. At its 5’-end, the galK<>Cmr targeting cassette contains 50 bp of sequence homologous to the
chromosomal region immediately upstream of the galK
gene, and 50 bp of sequence at its 3’-end homologous
to a region in the galK gene that is slightly upstream of
the termination codon (see Figure 11, Panel A).
The lambda-bet-exo, SXT-bet-exo and SXT-ssb-bet-exo
genes were analogously expressed from arabinose-inducible plasmids (pB1E4, pBex4b1 and pBX2B, respectively) constructed from pG5P4-1 which contains the
‘backbone’ of the pBAD-ETg plasmid [35] (see Additional File 3). An analogous arabinose-inducible plasmid
(pBAD-28MCS) containing the multiple cloning site
from pET28a in place of a gene encoding a homologous
recombination protein was used as a negative control,
and pBAD-ETg was included as an additional positive
control. pBAD-ETg contains a gene encoding the functional C-terminal domain of the RecE protein under the
control of the arabinose-inducible P BAD promoter, as
well as its partnering recT gene constitutively expressed
from a synthetic EM7 promoter and the lambda-gam
gene constitutively expressed from a TN5 promoter.
Plasmids were stably established within the DH10B
strain of E. coli, which was selected due to its high electroporation efficiency, and because it does not express
the RecA recombinase. Protein expression was induced
by the addition of arabinose to 0.1%, and transformed
strains were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour to allow sufficient time for the cellular synthesis of the DNA recombination proteins, before being made competent for
electroporation (’recombination competent’ cells). The
gene targeting efficiency was calculated by dividing the
number of chloramphenicol resistant colonies by the
total number of cells surviving electroporation (colony
forming units). Under the conditions tested, lambdaBet-Exo (B1E4) and RecET (pBAD-ETg) were found to
have approximately equal dsDNA homologous recombination efficiencies (3.8×10-6 and 3.7×10-6, respectively;
Figure 11, Panel B). The background recombination
levels (<1 × 10-10, pBAD-28MCS) were extremely low,
as DH10B is a recA- strain. The pBex4b1 (SXT-Bet-Exo)
and pBX2B (SXT-Ssb-Bet-Exo) plasmids had more than
50-fold lower recombination efficiencies of 7.5×10-8 and
3.5×10-8, respectively. However, this was still more than
300-fold higher than background levels, clearly demonstrating that the SXT-Bet and Exo proteins functioned
together to promote dsDNA recombination in E. coli.

Discussion
Sequence similarities between SXT-Exo and related
alkaline exonucleases of viral/phage origin

Lambda-Exo, G34.1P (SPP1-Chu) and SXT-Exo all
belong to the lambda Exonuclease (LE) superfamily of
alkaline exonucleases [13], which is also (somewhat confusingly) referred to as the ‘YqaJ-like viral recombinase
domain’ (pfam09588). Genes encoding lambda-Exo/YqaJ
homologues are commonly found in the genomes of
prokaryotes and prokaryotic mobile genetic elements;
often adjacent or proximal to genes encoding single
stand DNA annealing proteins (SSAPs) and single strand
DNA binding proteins (Ssbs) [12]. They fall within the
large PD-(D/E)XK restriction endonuclease superfamily
[15], and are phylogenetically and functionally related to
alkaline exonucleases from the baculoviridae and herpesviridae families such as: UL12 from Herpes Simplex
Virus type 1 (HSV-1) [47,48]; Kaposi’s Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) shut-off and exonuclease
(SOX) protein [57]; the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)
BGLF5 exonuclease [46,47,58]; and the alkaline nuclease
(Orf133) from the Autographa californica multiple-capsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) [50,59]. The RecE
exonuclease from E. coli has minimal sequence homology to lambda exonuclease/YqaJ family proteins, even
though it has many functional and structural similarities
[51,52,60,61].
SXT-Exo (338aa) and SPP1-Chu (311aa) are notably
longer than lambda-Exo (226aa); with shared homology,
conserved motifs and putative active site residues
located within the N-terminal 200aa region [13,26] (see
Additional File 1). Lambda-Exo crystallizes as a ‘doughnut-shaped’ torroidal trimer [19], but recombinant

G34.1P (SPP1-Chu) has been reported to form a dimer
in one study [27] and a pentamer or hexamer in another
[26]. Contrastingly, most eukaryotic viral alkaline exonucleases are monomeric and contain additional domains
at the N- and C-termini that are involved in proteinprotein interactions and DNA binding [15,57,58]. Our
size exclusion chromatography data (Figure 1) strongly
suggests that the active form of SXT-Exo is a torroidal
trimer that is structurally and functionally analogous to
lambda-Exo; even though it also shares high levels of
sequence homology with SPP1 G34.1 (Chu), which
appears to adopt a quite different multimeric
arrangement.
Optimal conditions for double strand DNA exonuclease
activities of the SXT-Exo protein

The SXT-Exo protein had maximal dsDNA exonuclease
activities in Tris-HCl buffer at a pH of 8.2 (Figure 3,
Panel C), which is slightly lower, but comparable to, the
pH optima of the lambda-Exo (pH 9.2-9.5 [18]) and
SPP1-Chu (pH 9.0 [26]) alkaline exonucleases. Whilst
lambda-Exo and SPP1-Chu optimally require Mg2+ ions
for catalytic activities [17,19,26,27], SXT-Exo is notably
different in its preference for Mn2+ ions over Mg2+ ions
(Figure 3, Panels A and B). Apart from the increased
apparent binding affinity for Mn2+ ions, results from our
in vitro experiments (those described here, as well as
those not shown) indicate that there are no distinguishable differences in substrate preferences or biochemical
activities of SXT-Exo in the presence of 10 mMgCl2 or
0.5 mM MnCl2; suggesting that these two ions are functionally interchangeable. In lambda-Exo, the Asp119,
Glu129 and Leu130 residues present within motifs 3

Mn2+ or Mg2+ ions are bound in an analogous manner.
To the best of our knowledge, intracellular manganese
and magnesium concentrations within V. cholerae cells
have not yet been determined. However, it appears likely
that the majority of SXT-Exo protein expressed within
SXT-infected V. cholerae cells would contain Mg2+ ions,
due to its presumably far-higher intracellular
concentrations.

recombination between a PCR-generated DNA fragment and
its homologous target on the E. coli chromosome. Panel A:
Schematic overview of the chromosomal targeting assay use to
score exonuclease + SSAP-mediate recombination efficiency. A
dsDNA ‘targeting’ molecule (galK<>Cmr) was synthesized by PCR
using two primers sharing (ca. 20 nt) sequence homology to a
chloramphenicol resistance cassette at one end; and 50 nt of
sequence homology to the 5’-end (ECgalKF1) or 3’-end (ECgalKR1)
of the non-essential E. coli galK gene at the other. The purified
galK<>Cmr targeting cassette was electroporated into DH10B cells
expressing pairs of Exo and SSAP proteins from established
arabinose-inducible plasmids. The Exo and SSAP proteins mediate
homologous recombination between the galK<>Cmr dsDNA
cassette and the galK locus of the E. coli chromosome via 50 bp
regions of flanking sequence homology. This creates a mutant E.
coli strain that has its galK gene replaced with a chloramphencol
resistance cassette. Panel B. Comparison of dsDNA recombination

The RecET; lambda-Bet-Exo; SXT-Bet-Exo and SXT-Ssb-Bet-Exo sets of

(negative control). Homologous recombination events were scored
by plating galK<>Cmr-electroporated cells onto LB-agar with/
without chloramphenicol. The dsDNA recombination efficiency was

and 4 (see Additional File 1, Panel B; motif numbering
according to Vellani and Myers [26]) are involved in
binding the divalent metal ion putatively involved in
phosphodiester bond hydrolysis [19]. These residues are
entirely conserved within SXT-Exo; equating to Asp100,
Glu110 and Leu111; which implies that the catalytic

The inability of SXT-Exo to digest dsDNA molecules
that contained phosphorothioate modifications near
their 5’-termini, clearly indicated that this protein functions as an exonuclease with strict 5’ to 3’-polarity. This
is mechanistically-consistent with the finding that the
5’-phosphorylation status of DNA substrates strongly
affects the efficiency by which they are enzymaticallydegraded. SXT-Exo digested 5’-phosphorylated dsDNA
ca. 20-fold more effectively (Figure 5), and 5’-phosphorylated ssDNA 1.5- to 3-fold more effectively (Figure
6) than the corresponding dephosphorylated substrates.
It has previously been shown that lambda-Exo and
G34.1P (SPP1-Chu) both exhibit similarly-strong preferences for ssDNA and dsDNA substrates with 5’-phosphorylated ends [17,24,27]. Subramanian et al. revealed
that the Arg28 residue of lambda-Exo plays a key role
in binding 5’-phosphorylated DNA substrates; with the
R28A mutant exhibiting an impaired ability to ‘recognize’ dsDNA ends, resulting in far lower levels of exonuclease processvity compared with the wild type enzyme
[24]. This arginine residue is highly conserved within
this class of alkaline exonucleases [13,15]; corresponding
to Arg17 in SXT-Exo and Arg20 in SPP1-Chu [26]
(located within motif 1 in Additional File 1, Panel B).
The notable inhibitory effects of phosphate and sulfate
ions (Figure 4) are consistent with them competing for
the protein binding site that accommodates the terminal
5’-phosphate group of DNA substrates.
Exonucleases may be broadly divided into two functional classes: distributive enzymes that dissociate after
removal of a single nucleotide; or processive enzymes
that remain bound to the DNA chain for a large number catalytic events, or until complete hydrolysis has
occurred [25]. The heparin-trap experiments revealed
that SXT-Exo digested dsDNA in a highly processive
manner; hydrolyzing an average of 746 ± 55 nucleotides
from each terminus before dissociation (Figure 9). Its
rate of DNA hydrolysis was determined to be ca. 7 nt/s.
The processivity and rate of digestion for SXT-Exo
reported here are comparable to those previously determined for lambda-Exo using bulk scale, solution-based
assays: i) a digestion rate of ca. 17 nt/s, with a processivity of ca. 400 nt [24]; ii) a digestion rate of 4-7 nt/s [54];
iii) a processivity of >3000 nt [22]. They are also similar

Chen et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2011, 12:16
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/12/16

to the figures obtained for the SPP1-Chu exonuclease: a
digestion rate of 2-3 nt/s, with a processivity of ca. 1000
nt [26]. This is consistent with these three alkaline exonuclease proteins sharing a common hydrolytic
mechanism.
When relatively long linear dsDNA substrates (linearized pUC18, 2686 bp) were used as substrates for the
SXT-Exo protein, the presence of blunt-ends, or short
(4 nt) 3’- or 5’-overhangs had little overall influence on
the levels of digestion (Figure 5). However, when shorter
(annealed oligonucleotide) substrates were used, which
contained considerably longer (20 nt) 3’- or 5’-oligothymidine overhangs; there were notable differences in its
relative digestion efficiencies (Figure 7). This suggests
that below a certain threshold, the length or type of
overhang present at the DNA terminus does not significantly affect the binding or ‘productive loading’ of the
exonuclease protein; only the 5’-phosphorylation status
is important. As may be seen in Figures 7 and 8, SXTExo and lambda-Exo exhibited an analogous ca. 2-fold
preference for the digestion of 5’-recessed and bluntended DNA substrates, over ones containing 5’-overhangs. This is fully consistent with the results of Mitsis
and Kwagh, who demonstrated that the rate constants
for DNA digestion mediated by lambda-Exo decreased
in the order: 10 nt 5’-recessed ends > blunt ends >>10
nt 5’-overhangs [54]. Taken together, our results indicate that the SXT-Exo and lambda-Exo proteins both
process linear dsDNA ends in a similar manner, producing the long 3’-ssDNA tails that are the substrates for
their respective SSAP partners.
Stimulation of SXT-Exo activities by SSAP and Ssb
proteins

It was previously shown that the G35P single strand
annealing protein from bacteriophage SPP1 stimulated
the exonuclease activities of its partnering G34.1P (Chu)
protein towards dsDNA substrates ca. 2- to 5-fold [27].
The authors further demonstrated that the G36P single
strand binding protein protected ssDNA from digestion
by G34.1P. However, they did not investigate whether
G36P modulated the dsDNA exonucleolytic activities of
G34.1P. Here, we found that the SXT-Bet, SXT-Ssb,
lambda-Bet and BSA proteins enhanced the dsDNA
exonuclease activities of both SXT-Exo and lambda-Exo
to differing extents; and none were inhibitory. Most
notably, the lambda-Bet SSAP protein stimulated the
activities of SXT-Exo almost 8-fold, which was substantially higher than the 2.2-fold stimulation in the presence of SXT-Bet (see Figure 10, Panel A). In the
reciprocal set of experiments, SXT-Bet and lambda-Bet
stimulated the dsDNA exonuclease activities of lambdaExo to a similar extent (3.4-fold and 3.3-fold, respectively; see Figure 10, Panel B). The SXT-Ssb protein

Page 18 of 21

stimulated the activities of SXT-Exo 3.2-fold, which was
considerably higher than its 1.9-fold stimulation of
lambda-Exo. There appears to be no obvious pattern or
trend for the abilities of the SSAP and Ssb proteins to
enhance the activities of the lambda-Exo or SXT-Exo
exonucleases. Furthermore, many mechanisms appear
plausible: e.g. the SSAP or Ssb proteins may open up
regions of ssDNA at the termini of the linear dsDNA
molecule, thereby facilitating the binding or ‘loading’ of
the torroid-shaped exonuclease trimers. The SSAP or
Ssb proteins may also promote the removal of nascent
hairpins, stem-loops or other intra- or inter-strand
annealed structures within the partially ssDNA molecules produced after an initial digestion event; thereby
facilitating exonuclease binding and subsequent digestion. More importantly, it remains to be seen whether
these in vitro effects have any direct correlation with the
biological activities of the Ssb, Bet and Exo proteins
from the SXT, lambda or related viral/phage DNA
recombination systems; either in their native arrangements, or in alternative permutations.
SXT-Exo and SXT-Bet promote DNA homologous
recombination in E. coli cells

We chose to investigate the homologous recombinationpromoting activities of SXT-Bet/Exo using a plasmidbased system in E. coli, as this would enable direct comparison with the well-studied lambda-Bet/Exo and
RecET protein pairs. Furthermore, as the adjacent SXTssb, bet and exo genes have an operon-like arrangement
on the SXT genetic element [2,10], this system presented a straightforward opportunity to investigate the
possible involvement of the single strand DNA binding
protein (SXT-Ssb, S064) protein in the dsDNA recombination process. Our results indicated that the SXT-Bet
+ SXT-Exo proteins (on plasmid pBex4b1) had modest
dsDNA recombination activity within E. coli; ca. 50-fold
less than those of RecET (pBAD-ETg) or lambda-Bet/
Exo (pB1E4A) under the conditions tested (Figure 11).
Even though the SXT-Ssb protein stimulated the exonuclease activities of SXT-Exo in vitro, the additional supply of the SXT-Ssb protein (on plasmid pBX2B) did not
enhance the recombination activities of SXT-Bet +
SXT-Exo; it slightly reduced them.
Datta et al. previously reported that the oligonucleotide-directed DNA recombination activities of the SXTBet protein were comparable to those of lambda-Bet
and RecT [39] in E. coli. Taken together with our findings, this suggests that the activities or biophysical properties of SXT-Exo may be limiting the combined
dsDNA recombination activities of the SX-Bet/Exo protein pair. It is possible that the intracellular environment
of E. coli may not be conducive to optimal SXT-Exo
activities, whilst SXT-Bet can function quite efficiently.

Chen et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2011, 12:16
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/12/16

This may be related to the fact that SXT-Bet shares significantly higher levels of amino acid identity with
lambda-Bet (55%) than SXT-Exo shares with lambdaExo (26%; see Additional File 1). E. coli is the native
host for the RecET and lambda-Bet/Exo proteins, but
the SXT/R391 family of ICEs infect entirely different
species of gamma-proteobacteria (e.g. V. cholerae and P.
rettgeri). Consequently, they may be optimized for activity within quite different bacterial hosts. Interestingly,
Datta et al. [39] further reported that all 4 pairs of
SSAP and Exo proteins tested in E. coli [G35P + G34.1P
(Chu) from bacteriophage SPP1; Orf47 + Orf48 from
Listeria monocytogenes; OrfC + OrfB from Legionella
pneumophila and Plu2935 + Plu2936 from Photorhabdus luminescens] had dsDNA recombination activities
that were >1000-fold less than those of lambda-Bet/Exo
(RecET was not tested). However the OrfC, Plu2935 and
Orf48 SSAP proteins all had ssDNA recombination
activities comparable to those of RecT or lambda-Bet.
This suggests that for 3 out of 4 sets of proteins tested,
the exonuclease protein may the cause of the low
dsDNA recombination activities.
Yamamoto et al. recently reported that the lambdaBet/Exo proteins (expressed from the pKD46 arabinoseinducible plasmid [37]) were capable of mediating
homologous recombination between PCR-generated
dsDNA fragments and the V. cholerae chromosome
[62]. Their results indicated that the recombination efficiencies of lambda-Bet/Exo in V. cholerae cells were
more than 100-fold less than in E. coli [39] and required
100 nt or longer flanking regions of homology on the
dsDNA ‘targeting cassettes’. These reduced efficiencies
may be due to degradation of the introduced PCR fragments by host cell nucleases [63], or may reflect the
reduced functional activities of the lambda-Bet/Exo proteins within V. cholerae. It would be extremely interesting to investigate the efficiency of the SXT-Bet + SXTExo proteins using similar approaches in V. cholerae
cells; especially within nuclease-deficient strains more
amenable to (natural or chitin-induced) DNA transformation [63], to see if these systems were better suited
for recombineering approaches in this species.
Biological and mechanistic implications of our findings

Taken together with previous findings, our results are
consistent with the following mode of activity (see Additional File 2). A trimer of SXT-Exo proteins bind to the
terminus of a linear dsDNA molecule: e.g. a ‘broken’
ICE molecule or host chromosomal double strand break
(DSB), in a process that is facilitated by the presence of
a 5’-phosphate group [24]. In the presence of Mn2+ or
Mg2+ ions, the SXT-Exo trimer then digests one DNA
strand in a highly processive manner from its 5’-terminus towards its 3’-end, whilst translocating along the

Page 19 of 21

complementary 3’-strand like a ‘bead on a string’ [19].
The long 3’-ssDNA overhangs formed are coated by the
partnering SXT-Bet protein, forming helical nucleoprotein filaments [28,29]. These nucleofilaments associate
with regions of homologous dsDNA on the host chromosome or viral genetic element, and mediate strand
annealing, strand exchange and possibly strand invasion
[31,32,34]. As SXT-Exo has no detectable nicking or
endonuclease activities, the fully circularized double
stranded or single stranded extrachromosomal forms of
SXT (or related ICE) will not act as substrates in the
absence of existing DNA breaks, or without the actions
of host restriction endonucleases [10]. The ssDNA exonuclease activities of SXT-Exo may play a role in DNA
‘strand assimilation’, by ‘trimming off’ redundant ssDNA
strands formed after the formation of joint DNA intermediates [21]. Furthermore, our finding that recombinant SXT-Exo cannot cleave circularized ssDNA
indicates that it does not modify the circular single
stranded form of SXT DNA that is the substrate for
conjugative transfer from donor to recipient cells
[3,4,10].

Conclusions
The S066 SXT-Exo protein has both single strand and
double strand DNA exonuclease activities, but no
detectable endonuclease or nicking activities. Adopting a
stable trimeric arrangement in solution, the dsDNA exonuclease activities of SXT-Exo are optimal at pH8.2 in
the presence of 2.5 mM Mn2+ ions; and are substantially
enhanced in the presence of SSAP and Ssb proteins.
Analogous to lambda-Exo, SXT-Exo degrades linear
dsDNA with 5’- to 3’-polarity, digesting substrates containing 5’-phosphate groups with high processivity. The
SXT-Exo and SXT-Bet (S065) proteins functioned
together to promote homologous recombination events
in E. coli cells, with an efficiency that was ca. 50-fold
lower than that of lambda-Bet/Exo or RecET under the
conditions tested.

processive manner from its 5’-terminus by the alkaline exonuclease
protein (e.g. SXT-Exo), generating long 3’-single stranded DNA (ssDNA)
‘tails’. The partnering single strand annealing protein (SSAP; e.g. SXT-Bet)
coats these long ssDNA tails, forming helical protein nucleofilaments. The
SSAP mediates annealing of the 3’-ssDNA-nucleofilament tail with a
complementary region of ssDNA on the other resected DNA molecule
(here, also depicted as being coated with SSAP, although this may or
may not be the case). Here, the torroidal trimer of Exo protein is shown
to dissociate from the non-digested strand, although this may not
necessarily be the case. The SSAP mediates displacement of the original
complementary strand, and promotes annealing of the (SSAP-coated)
complementary strand from the other DNA molecule until its 3’-terminus,
or until the end of its sequence homology. Any 3’-ssDNA overhangs
would not be digested by Exo, but by a host exonuclease with 3’-5’
ssDNA exonuclease activity (not shown). The Exo protein ‘trims’ both the
5’-ssDNA overhangs via its ssDNA exonucleolytic activity, until only a nick
remains, which is sealed by host DNA ligase.
