Abstract
Background: Popular methods to reconstruct molecular phylogenies are based on multiple
sequence alignments, in which addition or removal of data may change the resulting tree topology.
We have sought a representation of homologous proteins that would conserve the information of
pair-wise sequence alignments, respect probabilistic properties of Z-scores (Monte Carlo methods
applied to pair-wise comparisons) and be the basis for a novel method of consistent and stable
phylogenetic reconstruction.
Results: We have built up a spatial representation of protein sequences using concepts from
particle physics (configuration space) and respecting a frame of constraints deduced from pair-wise
alignment score properties in information theory. The obtained configuration space of homologous
proteins (CSHP) allows the representation of real and shuffled sequences, and thereupon an
expression of the TULIP theorem for Z-score probabilities. Based on the CSHP, we propose a
phylogeny reconstruction using Z-scores. Deduced trees, called TULIP trees, are consistent with
multiple-alignment based trees. Furthermore, the TULIP tree reconstruction method provides a
solution for some previously reported incongruent results, such as the apicomplexan enolase
phylogeny.
Conclusion: The CSHP is a unified model that conserves mutual information between proteins in
the way physical models conserve energy. Applications include the reconstruction of evolutionary
consistent and robust trees, the topology of which is based on a spatial representation that is not
reordered after addition or removal of sequences. The CSHP and its assigned phylogenetic
topology, provide a powerful and easily updated representation for massive pair-wise genome
comparisons based on Z-score computations.

sequences, an estimate of the relative time separating
branching events, previously supported by geological
records, could be formalized using mathematical models.
The use of proteins for evolutionary reconstructions was
vastly explored as soon as the first amino acid sequences
were made available [1-9]. The rich biological information contained in protein sequences stems from their
being, on the one hand, translation of genes that reflect
the history of genetic events to which the species has been
subjected, and on the other hand, effectors of the functions constituting a living creature [10] Since protein
sequences are encoded in a 20-amino acid alphabet, they
are also considered to embody more information-per-site
than DNA or RNA [11]; they also exhibit smaller compositional trends [12,13]. When compared, sequences that
share substantial features are considered as possible
homologues [14], based on the fundamental postulate
that can be simply stated as "the closer in the evolution,
the more alike and conversely, the more alike, probably the
closer in the evolution".
As summarized by Otu and Sayood [15], the techniques of
molecular phylogenetic analyses can be divided into two
groups. In the first case, a matrix representing the distance
between each pair of sequences is calculated and then
transformed into a tree. In the second case, a tree is found
that can best explain the observed sequences under evolutionary assumptions, after evaluation of the fitness of different topologies. Some of the approaches in the first
category utilize distance measures [16-19] with different
models of nucleotide substitution or amino acid replacement. The second category can further be divided into two
groups based on the optimality criterion used in tree evaluation: parsimony [20,21] and maximum likelihood
methods [22,23]. For a detailed comparison of these
methods see [24].
In phylogeny inference based on distance methods, features separating related proteins are used to estimate an
observed distance, also called the p-distance, the simplest
measure of which is just the number of different sites
between proteins. Divergence time (t), also called genetic
distance or evolutionary time, is calculated from the p-distance, depending on assumptions derived from evolutionary models [11,24]. For example, the assumption that
mutational events happen with equal probability at each
site of any sequence leads to the molecular clock model
[2]. Although widely used, it is well-known to be unrealistic and numerous corrections have been proposed to
refine it [19,25,26]. By definition, the distance matrix is
given as T = (tab) where a and b represent the homologous
sequences from the analyzed dataset. Tree reconstruction
algorithms are then applied to these matrices [11,24].
Eventually, phylogenetic trees corresponding to the classified sequences are statistically evaluated with bootstrap

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/49

methods and, when available, calibrated using dated fossils [25,26].
Doolittle et al. [27] have proposed methods for converting amino acid alignment scores into measures of evolutionary time. Similarity between amino acids [28-30]
provides a way to weight and score alignments [31]. In
practice the optimal alignment of two sequences (a and b)
is determined from the optimal score s(a,b) [25,27], computed with a dynamic programming procedure [32,33]. In
aligned sequences, conservation is measured at identical
sites, whereas variation is scaled at substituted sites. To
estimate the variation/conservation balance, the p-distance
can be given as a function of fid, the fraction of identical
residues: p-distance = 1 - fid. To take into account that multiple mutations can happen at the same site, an expression
of fid was proposed by Doolittle et al. [27] using s(a*,b*),
the score obtained from randomized a and b sequences
[34] and sid, the average score of the sequences compared
with themselves [19,25,27]:

fid ( a, b ) =

s(a, b) − s(a*, b*)
sid − s(a*, b*)

(1)

To connect pair-wise alignments and phylogeny, divergence time has been approximated:
t(a,b) = -λ log[fid (a,b)]

(2)

introducing a Poisson correction [2] as a reasonable stochastic law relating amino acid changes and elapsed time.
As mentioned earlier, adjustments and corrections of
equation (2) were proposed to fit more realistically the
complexity of evolution [11,25,35]. This attempt of unification helped reconstructing phylogeny of major lineages
[27]. However, detailed phylogenic trees obtained from
evolutionary close sequences are not satisfactory. In practice, phylogenies are reconstructed based on multiple
alignments. Multiple alignment based (MAB) trees are recalculated when incremented with additional sequences;
although MAB methods are usually considered accurate,
numerous cases of inconsistencies (incongruence)
between observed data and deduced MAB trees are
recorded (see [15,36]).
Here, we re-examine the estimate of the p-distance between
two homologous sequences, based on fid, as a source for
geometric positioning, divergence time calculations and
evolutionary reconstruction. We based our model on
mathematical properties that alignment scores should
respect; i) information theory [37,38] applied to sequence
similarity, ii) algorithmic theory applied to alignment
optimization [28] and iii) alignment probability, particularly in conformity with the TULIP theorem [39]. We used
these properties as a framework of constraints to build a

geometric representation of a space of probably homologous proteins and define a theoretically explicit measure
of protein proximity. This unified model conserves information in the way physical models conserve matter or
energy. The obtained representation of protein sequences
is unaltered by adding or removing sequences. Applications include therefore the reconstruction of evolutionary
consistent and robust trees, the topology of which is based
on a spatial representation that is not reordered after addition or removal of sequences.

Results and discussion
Pair-wise sequence alignment scores in information theory
Criteria to measure the variation/conservation balance
between proteins should embody as much as possible the
structural and functional potentiality within sequences of
amino acids. In the absence of explicit physical criteria,
amino acid similarity was solved empirically by measuring amino acid substitution frequencies in alignments of
homologous sequences [30,40]. Given two amino acids i
and j, the similarity function s(i,j) was set as:

s(i, j) = log

ϖ ij

( 3)

π iπ j

where ϖij is the observed frequency of substitution of i by
j or j by i, and πi and πj are the frequencies of i and j in the
two aligned sequences. The ϖij frequency is the estimate of
the probability of substitution of i by j in real alignments;
whereas πiπj is the estimate of the probability of substitution under the independency hypothesis. The similarity
function gives a 20 × 20 similarity matrix usable to score
protein sequence alignments, that can be interpreted in
the information theory [37,38] according to the following
proposition.
Proposition 1
Amino acid substitution matrix values are estimates of the
mutual information between amino acids in the sense of
Hartley [37,38]. Consequently, the optimal alignment
score computed between two biological sequences is an
estimate of the optimal mutual information between
these sequences.
Proof
Given a probability law P that characterizes a random variable, the Hartley self-information h is defined as the
amount of information one gains when an event i
occurred, or equivalently the amount of uncertainty one
loses after learning that i happened:

h(i) = -log(P(i))

(4)

The less likely an event i, the more we learn about the system when i happens. The mutual information I between

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/49

two events, is the reduction of the uncertainty of one event
i due to the knowledge of the other j:
Ij→i = h(i) - h(i/j)

(5)

Mutual information is symmetrical, i.e. Ij→i = Ii→j, and in
the following will be expressed by I(i;j). The self and
mutual information of two events i and j are related:
h(i ∩ j) = h(i) + h(j) - I(i;j)

(6)

If the occurrence of one of the two events makes the second impossible, then the mutual information is equal to
- ∞. If the two events are fully independent, mutual information is null. The empirical measure of the similarity
between two amino acids described in equation (3) can
therefore be expressed in probabilistic terms:
s(i, j) = log(

ϖ ij
π iπ j

) = log(Pϖ (i ∩ j)) − log(Pπ (i)) − log(Pπ ( j))

(7)

where Pϖ is the joint probability to have i and j aligned in
a given alignment and Pπ the measure of probability that
amino acids occur in a given sequence. From equations
(4) and (6), equation (7) becomes:
s(i, j) = h(i) + h(j) - h(i ∩ j)

(8)

that is
s(i, j) = I(i; j)

(9)

As a consequence, the similarity function (or score) is the
mutual information between two amino acids. Additionally, the score between sequences (the sum of elementary
scores between amino acids, [32,33,41,42]) is, according
to the hypothesis of independence of amino acid positions, the estimated mutual information between the two
given biological sequences.
Once two sequences are aligned, we pose the question
whether the alignment score is sufficient to assess that the
proteins are conceivably alike and thus evolutionarily
related? The theorem of the upper limit of a sequence
alignment score probability (TULIP theorem, [39]), sets
the upper bound of an alignment score probability, under
a hypothesis less restrictive than the Karlin-Altschul
model [43]. Given two real sequences a and b (a =
a1a2...am and b = b1b2...bn), where s = s(a,b) the maximal
score of a pair-wise alignment obtained with any alignment method, b* the variable corresponding to the shuffled sequences from b, and given P{S(a,b*)≥s} the
probability that an alignment by chance between a and b*
has a higher score than s, then whatever the distribution
of the random variable S(a,b*) the TULIP theorem states:

with k > 1, µ the mean of S(a, b*) and σ its standard deviation. The unique restriction on S(a,b*) is that it has a
finite mean and a finite variance. A first corollary of the
TULIP theorem is that the Z-score is a statistical test for the
probability of a sequence alignment score. We additionally state the following new corollary.

Question of the proximity between protein sequences in
the light of information theory
Since the optimized alignment score of two protein
sequences allows an access to both the mutual information between proteins and an upper bound that the alignment is not fortuitous, one would expect that it is an
accurate way to spatially organize proteins sets. A simple
relation would be "the higher the mutual information, the
nearest". There are three ways to assess the proximity
between two objects a and b in a given space E [41]. The
first is dissimilarity, a function f(a,b): E × E → ℜ + such
that f(a,b) = 0 ⇔ a = b and f(a,b) = f(b,a); the second is the
distance per se, that is a dissimilarity such that the triangle
inequality is respected: ∀ a,b,c ∈ E, f(a,c) ≤ f(a,b) + f(b,c);
and the third is the similarity defined as a function f(a,b):

E × E → ℜ such that f (a, a) = max f (a, b) and f(a,b) =
b

f(b,a). Representing objects in a space is convenient using
the notion of distance. When the optimal alignment is
global, i.e. requiring that it extends from the beginning to
the end of each sequence [32], it is theoretically possible
to define a distance per se, that is to spatially organize the
compared sequences [41]. However, from a biological
point of view, global alignment algorithms are not reliable to assess homology of protein domains. Local align-

ments are better suited, using scoring matrices to find the
optimum local alignment and maximizing the sum of the
scores of aligned residues [28,31]. In contrast with global
alignments, local alignments do not allow any trivial definition of distances [41].
Although amino acid similarity is a function f(i, j): E × E
→ ℜ , owing to the local alignment optimization algorithms, the computed score is a function f(a,b): E × E →
ℜ +, requiring the existence of at least one positive score in
the similarity matrices. Thus, when constructing an alignment with the Smith and Waterman [33] method, the
constraint that s(a,b)>0 (i.e. I(a;b) > 0) is imposed. This
condition is consistent with proposition 1: if two
sequences are homologous, knowledge about the first has
to bring information about the second, that is to say, the
mutual information between the two sequences cannot
decrease below zero: I(a;b) > 0 (i.e. s(a,b) > 0). As a consequence, in the following geometric construction we
sought a refined expression for the proximity of proteins.
Geometric construction of a configuration space of
homologous proteins (CSHP) conserving mutual
information
In a set of homologous proteins, any sequence a can be
selected as a reference, noted aref, in respect to which the
others are compared. A geometric representation of
objects relatively to a fixed frame is known as a configuration space (CS). In physics, a CS is a convenient way to
represent systems of particles, defined by their positional
vectors in some reference frame. Here, given n similar
sequences, it is therefore possible to consider n references
of the CSHP. In a given (CSHP, aref), each amino acid
position aligned with a position in the aref sequence, corresponds to a comparison dimension (CS dimension).
Proteins are simply positioned by a vector, the coordinates of which are given by the scores of aligned amino
acids. Gaps are additional dimensions of the CS. When
considering that local algorithms identify the space of biological interest, i.e. a CSHP, the gap penalty is a parameter
that maximizes the shared informative dimensions. Thus,
given the amino acids mutual information, alignment
optimization methods define the relative positions of
proteins.

At this point in our construction, a first important property of the CSHP can be deduced. Since mutual information with aref is sufficient for the full positioning, then
positioning of proteins in a given (CSHP, aref) is unambiguous, unique, and is not altered when proteins are added
or removed. In other words, a (CSHP, aref) is a univocal
space.
Given two sequences a and b, if b occurs in (CSHP, aref),
then a also occurs in (CSHP, bref). The pair-wise alignment
Page 4 of 16

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/49

of a and b having no order (symmetry of the mutual information), the positions of b in (CSHP, aref) is dependent of
the position of a in (CSHP, bref). Thus, once a (CSHP, aref)
has been built, ∀b ∈ (CSHP, aref), part of the geometry of
(CSHP, bref) is learnt. Thus, in a CSHP, information
needed for the position of n sequences is totally contained
in the geometry of the n (CSHP, aref). This geometric stability is not observed with multiple alignments, which can
be deeply modified by addition or removal of sequences.
In the CSHP, protein position is unaltered by additions or
removals of other proteins. In practice, the construction of
CSHP is therefore completely deduced from any all-by-all
protein sequence comparison [45,46] and can be easily
updated.
The q-dissimilarity, a proximity notion for a geometric
representation of the CSHP
In the CSHP, the definition of a distance per se based on
mutual information is reduced ad absurdum (For demonstration, see methods). To define a proximity function i)
sharing properties of distance, i.e. increasing when objects
are further apart, ii) deriving from similarity and iii) relying on mutual information, particularly the property
"f(a,a) ≠ f(b,b) is possible", we introduce a fourth notion
of proximity. Such proximity was called q-dissimilarity (for
quasi-dissimilarity), a function f(a,b): E × E → ℜ + is
defined such that

( 12 )

∀a ∈ E, f (a, a) = min f (a, b)
b∈E

∀ a ∈ E, ∀ b ∈ E, f(a,b) = f(b,a)

(13)

Let s be a similarity, then q = e-s is a q-dissimilarity, named
the 'canonical q-dissimilarity' associated to s. Accordingly,
the TULIP theorem allows a statistical characterization of
q(a,b) the canonical q-dissimilarity between two
sequences a and b.
TULIP corollary 3
From the TULIP corollary 2, relation (14) is simply
deduced:

P { Q(a, b*) ≤ q(a, b)} ≤

1
z(a, b*)²

( 14 )

with Q(a,b*) being the random q-dissimilarity variable
associated with S(a,b*). Given a (CSHP, aref), each
sequence b aligned with a is characterized by a q-dissimilarity q(a,b). In geometric terms, b can be represented as a
point contained in a hyper-sphere B of radius q(a,b).
The representation of a (CSHP, aref) shown in Figure 1 is
therefore in conformity with all constraints listed earlier
and can also serve as a Venn diagram for the setting of
events realized following a continuous random variable

Q(a,b*). When a is compared to itself, it is set on a hypersphere A of radius q(a,a), which is not reduced to one
point. In the context of information theory, it is therefore
possible to express that the proximity respects the property "q(a,a) ≠ q(b,b) is possible". Considering Figure 1,

1
is the probability for a
z(a, b*)²
random sequence b* to be in the hyper-sphere B. In conclusion, the q-dissimilarity is therefore a proximity notion
that allows a rigorous geometric description of the configuration space of homologous proteins, real or simulated,
(CSHP, aref, q).
P { Q(a, b*) ≤ q(a, b)} ≤

Unification of pair-wise alignments theory, information
theory, p-distance and q-dissimilarity in the CSHP model
A geometric space is a topological space when endowed
with characterized paths that link its elements. Here, paths
can be defined as the underlying evolutionary history separating sequences [11]. Given u the common unknown
ancestor, then the divergence time t(a,b) is theoretically
the summed elapsed times separating u to a and to b.
Without any empirical knowledge of u, the simplest
approximation for t(a,b) was sought as a function of the
fraction of identical residues fid, thus of the p-distance.
With the hypothesis of the molecular clock, this function
can be given as equation (2), where the transmutation of
a and b is a consequence of a Poisson process. By using
relation (9) on the equivalence between score similarity
and mutual information, then the fundamental postulate
"the closer in the evolution, the more alike and conversely, the more alike, probably the closer in the evolution" can be reformulated:
Fundamental postulate
Given two homologous proteins a and b, the closer in the
evolution, the greater the mutual information between a
and b (i.e. the optimal computed score s(a,b)) and conversely, the greater the mutual information between a and
b, probably the closer in the evolution.

Whereas the first part of the postulate is a consequence of
the conservational pressure on mutual information, the
second assertion founds the historical reconstruction
underlying a set of biological sequences on statistical concepts. A corollary is that evolution of two homologous
proteins is characterized by a loss of mutual information.
In the CSHP, this formulation of the fundamental postulate allows a novel mathematical formalization of the pdistance in probabilistic terms. Basically, the p-distance is
the divergence observed between two sequences knowing
that they share some features (the observed sequences a
and b) and that they were identical before the speciation
event (sequence u).

Geometric and probabilistic representation of the configuration space of homologous proteins (CSHP)
Geometric and probabilistic representation of the configuration space of homologous proteins (CSHP). For any sequence a
taken as a reference (aref), one can build a configuration space (CSHP, aref) where all sequences that are homologous to a can
be set. When two sequences a and b are aligned with a score s(a,b), then b is positioned in (CSHP, aref) and a in (CSHP, bref).
The sequence alignment length determines the number of configuration dimensions; pair-wise amino acid scores determine the
unique solution for its positioning. The q-dissimilarity (q = e-s) defines a proximity between sequences allowing a geometric
representation (CSHP, q). Remarkable properties are i) the conservation of mutual information, [I(a;b) = I(b;a) ⇒ q(a,b) =
q(b,a)], between (CSHP, aref) and (CSHP, bref), ii) a probabilistic representation of homologies based on q-dissimilarities by Venn
diagrams (A and B) and iii) the assignment of a topology relying on protein evolution assumptions. Evolutionary paths for a and
b lineages, sharing an unknown ancestor u, have a probabilistic expression, bounded above (see text), supporting a phylogenetic
topology (TULIP trees).

Looking back to equation (1), we can re-formulate fid in
probabilistic terms, considering the fraction of shared features (identical sites) knowing the observed data and the
existence of a common ancestor. Given two proteins a and
b, let us consider the random variable Q(a,b*), defined in
TULIP corollary 3. In (CSHP, aref), shown in Figure 1, one
can define the probability law P{Q(a,b*)≤ρ} as the probability that the q-dissimilarity between b* and aref is lower
than ρ. The hyper-sphere of radius ρ contains therefore
the b* random sequences sharing informative features
with a accordingly. The probability pid/a that b* shares
identity with a, knowing that the q-dissimilarity between
b* and a is lower than that between the real sequences b
and a, is:

which is a probabilistic expression of fid in respect to the
reference aref. According to the Venn diagram in Figure 1:
pid/a (b*) = P(A/B)

pid/a (b*) = P{Q(a,b*) ≤ q(a,a) / Q(a,b*) ≤ q(a,b)}

which can be expressed as

(15)

Using the Bayes theorem, equation (15) can be expressed
as:

pid / a (b*) = P( A / B) =

P( A ∩ B) P( A)
=
P(B)
P(B)

( 16 )

In consequence:

pid / a (b*) =

P { Q(a, b*) ≤ q(a, a)}
P { Q(a, b*) ≤ q(a, b)}

( 17 )

pid / a (b*) =

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/49

P { S(a, b*) ≥ s(a, a)}

From relation (20), t(a,b) appears as a function of Z-score
ratios. For any set of homologous proteins, it is therefore
possible to measure a table of pair-wise divergence times
and build phylogenetic trees using distance methods.

( 18 )

P { S(a, b*) ≥ s(a, b)}

Assuming that substitution rates are independent of lineages [35], then random sequence models a* and b* are
equivalent, that is to say Q(a,a*) ≈ Q(a,b*) and
pid / a (b*) =

P { Q(a, b*) ≤ q(a, a)}
P { Q(a, b*) ≤ q(a, b)}

≈

P { Q(a, a*) ≤ q(a, a)}
P { Q(a, b*) ≤ q(a, b)}

( 19 )

Thus pid/a, and symmetrically pid/b, provide a probabilistic
expression of fid knowing the data, i.e. the observed mutual
information between a and b expressed as Q(a,b).
Given two homologous sequences a and b, when their
optimal score is s(a,b) ≥ µ + ψ with ψ being a critical
threshold value depending on the score distribution law
(See Methods for the demonstration for the critical threshold), owing to the TULIP corollary 2, we can state that pid/
a is bounded above:
pid / a (b*) ≈

P { S(a, a*) ≥ s(a, a)}
P { S(a, b*) ≥ s(a, b)}

l (a, a*) z(a, b*)²

where µ1, σ1, µ2 and σ2 are the mean and the standard

equation (1), showing that the pragmatic approach by
Feng and Doolittle [19] could be supported and generalized in a theoretical elaboration.
Using the Poisson correction, an expression of t(a,b) is
given as the linear combination of the two corrections of
the p-distance deduced from pid/a and pid/b :
t(a,b) = -[log(pid/a (b*)) +log(pid/b (a*))]

(22)

with a* and b* the random variables corresponding to the
shuffled sequences of a and b respectively. The sum of the
logarithms corresponds to the product of the two probabilities, an expression of the hypothesis of independence
of lineage. Interestingly, equation (22) provides an
expression of the symmetric effect of time on the variations that independently affected a and b.

Reconstruction of protein phylogeny: first example, case
study of the glucose-6-phosphate isomerase phylogeny
We compared the trees we obtained, called TULIP trees, to
phylogenetic trees built using classical methods, for
instance the popular PHYLIP [47] or PUZZLE-based [48]
methods, termed here MAB trees (for multiple alignmentbased trees). Firstly, because MAB trees are constructed
from multiple alignments, removals or additions of proteins modify the multiple alignments. Inclusion of
sequences is considered as a way to improve the quality of
multiple alignments and to increase the sensitivity of the
comparison of distant sequences [49,50]. By contrast, the
protein space used to build TULIP trees is not reordered
when data sets are incremented or decremented (drawing
of the TULIP tree may apparently change due to the tree
graphic representation methods; nevertheless the absolute tree topology is not reordered). This remarkable property is due to both the geometrical construction by pairwise comparison and the convergence of the distance
matrix elements estimated by equation (21). Indeed, the
estimate of the right-hand term of equation (21) relies on
a Monte Carlo method, after randomization of the biological sequences [39,44,51] and is therefore dependent on
the sequence randomization model [52] and convergent
in respect to the weak law of large numbers [53]. Conver-

gence is proportional to 1/ numbrand , where numbrand is
the number of randomizations. In the case studies presented here, we set numrand = 2000 (see Methods). By contrast, stability of MAB trees is sought by bootstrapping
approaches and consensus tree reconstruction. MAB trees
appear as the result of a complex learning process including possible re-adjustment of the multiple alignments
after eye inspection pragmatically applied to assist the
reconstruction. Alternatively, Bayesian analyses have been
recently proposed for phylogenetic inference [54], estimating posterior probability of each clades to assess most
likely trees. Still, in a recent comparative study, Suzuki et
al. [55] and Simmons et al. [56] provided evidence supporting the use of relatively conservative bootstrap and
jacknife approaches rather than the more extreme overestimates provided by the Markov Chain Monte Carlobased Bayesian methods. In the absence of any decisive
methods to assess the validity of the trees obtained after
such different approaches, no absolute comparison with
the TULIP classification trees can be rigorously provided.
Whenever a TULIP classification was achieved on a dataset
that led to a consensual MAB tree, both were always consistent. For example, Figure 2 shows the phylogenetic
PHYLIP [47] and TULIP trees obtained for glucose-6Page 7 of 16

phosphate isomerases (G6PI). Phylogeny of the G6PI
enzyme has been studied by Huang et al. [57] in order to
demonstrate the horizontal transfer of this enzyme in the
apicomplexan phylum due to a past endosymbiosis [57].
Owing to the neighbor-joining analysis used by Huang et
al. [57] (see methods) Figure 2A shows that apicomplexan
G6PI is "plant-like". The TULIP tree shown in Figure 2B is
consistent with this conclusion. Interestingly, differences
between the two trees are found only when the bootstrap
values on the MAB tree are not strong enough to unambiguously assess branching topology.

Reconstruction of protein phylogeny: second example,
case study of the enolase phylogenic incongruence
TULIP classification tree further helps in solving apparent
conflicting results obtained with MAB methods. In a comprehensive study from Keeling and Palmer [36] the PUZZLE-based reconstruction of the enolase phylogeny led to
incongruent conclusions. Enolase proteins from a wide
spectrum of organisms were examined to understand the
evolutionary scenario that might explain that enolases
from land plants and alveolates shared two short insertions. Alveolates comprise apicomplexan parasites,
known to contain typical plant features as mentioned
above, particularly a plastid relic. In this context, the
shared insertion in apicomplexan and plant enolases (Figure 3) has been interpreted as a possible signature for

Figure phylogenic incongruence
Enolase 3
Enolase phylogenic incongruence. When aligned, the enolase region corresponding to amino acids 73–118 of the Oryza sativa
gene, exhibit two insertions (red boxes) that are only present in land plants, charophytes and alveolates. In alveolates, these
insertions are consistent with a horizontal gene transfer. However, to date, evolutionary reconstructions based on enolase
sequences did not allow any phylogenetic branch gathering for these clades [36].

some evolutionary relationship between apicomplexans
and plants [58,59] and a likely sign of a lateral transfer.
From the distribution of this insertion in enolases from
several key eukaryotic groups, Keeling and Palmer [36]
postulated that lateral transfer had been an important
force in the evolution of eukaryotic enolases, being
responsible for their origin in cryptomonads, Chlorarachnion and Arabidopsis. However, they could not conclude about alveolates, finding a conflict between the
distribution of the insertion and the MAB phylogenetic
position (Figure 4A). The authors had to admit that lateral
gene transfers failed to explain apicomplexa enolases, and
were compelled to suppose that the lack of congruence

between insertion and phylogeny could be because of a
parallel loss of insertions in lineages, or to more complex
transfers of gene portions.
Based on our theoretical model, we constructed the corresponding TULIP tree. TULIP trees given with BLOSUM 62
or PAM 250 matrices, Fitch-Margoliash or neighbor-joining methods led indistinctly to a unique tree topology
(Figure 4B). Separation of great phyla (Archaebacteria,
Eubacteria, Diplomonads, Trypanasomes, Animals, Fungi
and Amoeba) is recovered. A plant-like cluster is additionally reconstructed, in which a distinct separation occurred
between {Rhodophytes ; Cryptomonads} and {Land

Solution4 the enolase phylogenic incongruence
Solution of the enolase phylogenic incongruence. (A) Multiple alignment based (MAB) tree. (B) TULIP tree. Both trees were
constructed using the BLOSUM 62 similarity matrix. For MAB tree construction, bootstrap support was estimated using 1000
replicates. To build TULIP trees, Z-scores were estimated with 2000 sequence shuffling. Clades that contain a unique insertional signature (Land plants, green box; Charophytes and Chlorarachnion, blue box; Alveolates; yellow box) are not gathered
in the MAB tree, as previously reported [36]. By contrast, in the TULIP tree, the phylogeny of enolase proteins is reconciled
with the insertional signature detection in Land plants, Charophytes, Chlorarachnion and Alveolates.

Plants ; Charophytes ; Chlorarachnion ; Alveolates} main
clusters. It is remarkable that this latter cluster is that characterized by the enolase insertion.
This topology corresponds to the observed distribution of
the enolase short insertions and provides therefore a solution to the apparent enolase phylogeny incongruence: the
phylogenetic position of alveolates is not in conflict with
the distribution of enolase insertion and the apicomplexa
enolase is possibly a consequence of a lateral transfer, like
in cryptomonads.

Large scale phylogeny based on a CSHP built from massive
genomic pair-wise comparisons
A CSHP containing large sets of protein sequences can be
built after any all-by-all massive comparison providing Zscore statistics. Because the space elaboration is explicit,
then quality of the mutual information conservation
depends on the choice of the scoring matrix, the geometric positioning depends on the local alignment method,
the homology assessment depends on the alignment score
and probabilistic cutoffs and the phylogenetic topology
on the choice of the stochastic law correction. Eventually,

genome-scale pair-wise comparisons [39,36] find in the
present CSHP a robust, evolutionary consistent and easily
updatable representation.

Demonstration that distance of a protein to itself cannot
be defined in the CSHP
In the simplest case, building a distance between amino
acids (that would lead to distance between sequences) on
the basis of computed similarity values would have to
respect the condition:

∀i ∈ E, ∀j ∈ E,d(i,j) = 0 ⇒ i = j

(a)

onstration that, given S the random variable corresponding to the alignment scores of pairs of shuffled sequences
and µ the mean of S, given two homologous sequences a
and b, when their optimal score is s(a,b) ≥ µ + ψ (with ψ a
critical threshold value depending on the score distribution law), owing to the TULIP corollary 2, we can state
that pid/a is bounded above

pid / a (b*) ≈

P { S(a, a*) ≥ s(a, a)}

l (a, a*) z(a, b*)²
=
≤ υ
P { S(a, b*) ≥ s(a, b)} lυ (a, b*) z(a, a*)²

To the purpose of this demonstration, we considered the
cumulative distribution function F(s) = P(S ≤ s), its derivative f(s) known as the probability density function
defined as dF(s) = f(s)ds, and the positive delta function δ
(s) = (s - µ)2(1 - F(s)). Since δ (s) = (s - µ)2(1 - F(s)) is null

for i and j, two given amino acids and d the distance function. Using this condition in the proposition, any organization of the CSHP with a geometric distance is reduced
ad absurdum.

for s = µ and lim δ ( s) = 0 , the Rolle's theorem implies

Proposition
Building a distance between amino acids derived from the
composed function d(i,j) = (φ ❍ s)(i,j), where s is a similarity function and φ a bijection, is impossible without a
loss of mutual information. Moreover, two proteins from
distinct organisms can have the same configuration, being
like "twins", and d(i,j) = 0 does not imply i = j.

2(1 - F(s)) - (s - µ) f(s) = 0

Proof
Condition (a) implies that φ (s(i,i)) = φ (s(j,j)) = 0. This
equality imposes that s(i,i) = s (j,j) and, following equation (7) of main text, that I(i;i) = I(j;j). Considering for
example tryptophan (W) and glutamic acid (E), if W
occurs in a sequence, the mutual information gained
about the occurrence of W at the aligned position would
be the same as that gained in the case of E about the occurrence of E at the aligned position in the homologous protein. This statement is easily rejected on the basis of
biochemical concerns. On one hand, aspartic acid (D)
shares common biochemical properties with E, particularly a carboxylic acid, and easily substitutes in homologous sequences. By contrast W, exhibiting a unique
biochemical feature, is less substitutable without altering
the function. Thus the mutual information I(E;E) is necessarily lower than I(W;W). This that can be checked in
scoring matrices such as BLOSUM 62 [30] where I(E;E) =
5, I(D;D) = 6 and I(W;W) = 11. Condition d(i,i) = 0 leads
to an obvious loss of information. The second assertion of
the proposition is obvious.
Determination of the threshold value ψ, for topological
reconstructions in the CHSP based on pair-wise alignment
score probabilities
An important basis of the reconstruction of a probabilistic
evolutionary topology in the CSHP is based on the dem-

one can express as

The

2(1 − F( s))
term corresponds to a continuous funcf ( s)

f ( s)
is known as the haz(1 − F( s))
ard function [61], that is the probability of s, per score unit
(i.e. mutual information), conditional to the fact that the
pair-wise alignment score is at least equal to s. The hazard

In consequence, δ (s) reaches its maximum for a s0 (s0 ≤ µ
+ ψ) and it is strictly decreasing on ]µ + ψ ,+∞[.
The estimation of s0 is not trivial because it depends on the
knowledge of the cumulative distribution function. Extensive studies provided experimental and theoretical supports for an extreme value distribution of alignment
scores [31,43,44]. Using the extreme value distribution of
type I, i.e. the Gumbel distribution [62], the cumulative
distribution is given by

replicates. To build TULIP trees, for each couple of
sequences a and b, alignment was achieved with the
Smith-Waterman method and the BLOSUM 62 scoring
matrices, using the BIOFACET package from Gene-IT,
France [64]. We computed estimated z-scores z(a,b*),
z(a,a*), z(a*,b), z(b*,b*), with 2000 sequence shuffling.
For all computations, an estimation of the Gumbel
parameters θ and β was made using the computed µ and

βΓ'(1), where Γ'(1) ≈ 0.577216 is the Euler constant. In all
computations, both Gumbel parameters were very close
(in the case of enolases, mean(θ) = 35.04, SD(θ) = 0.12,
mean(β) = 3.92, SD(β) = 0.08). As a consequence, the
assumption Q(a,a*) ≈ Q(a,b*) was verified for any pair of
sequences. We used the parameters to estimate µ = θ + βΓ
'(1) (in the case of enolases, µ = 37.33), and µ + ψ ≈ µ +
10.5178 ≈ 47.85. As any pairs of computed scores are
higher than this critical threshold, we used relation [20].
Estimation of evolutionary time was achieved according
to equations [20] and [22]. Trees were constructed using
Fitch-Margoliash and Neighbor-Joining methods [47].
