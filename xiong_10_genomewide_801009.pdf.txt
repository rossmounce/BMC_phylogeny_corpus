Genome-wide identification and evolution of
ATP-binding cassette transporters in the ciliate
Tetrahymena thermophila: A case of functional
divergence in a multigene family

Abstract
Background: In eukaryotes, ABC transporters that utilize the energy of ATP hydrolysis to expel cellular substrates
into the environment are responsible for most of the efflux from cells. Many members of the superfamily of ABC
transporters have been linked with resistance to multiple drugs or toxins. Owing to their medical and toxicological
importance, members of the ABC superfamily have been studied in several model organisms and warrant
examination in newly sequenced genomes.
Results: A total of 165 ABC transporter genes, constituting a highly expanded superfamily relative to its size in
other eukaryotes, were identified in the macronuclear genome of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. Based on
ortholog comparisons, phylogenetic topologies and intron characterizations, each highly expanded ABC transporter
family of T. thermophila was classified into several distinct groups, and hypotheses about their evolutionary
relationships are presented. A comprehensive microarray analysis revealed divergent expression patterns among
the members of the ABC transporter superfamily during different states of physiology and development. Many of
the relatively recently formed duplicate pairs within individual ABC transporter families exhibit significantly different
expression patterns. Further analysis showed that multiple mechanisms have led to functional divergence that is
responsible for the preservation of duplicated genes.
Conclusion: Gene duplications have resulted in an extensive expansion of the superfamily of ABC transporters in
the Tetrahymena genome, making it the largest example of its kind reported in any organism to date. Multiple
independent duplications and subsequent divergence contributed to the formation of different families of ABC
transporter genes. Many of the members within a gene family exhibit different expression patterns. The
combination of gene duplication followed by both sequence divergence and acquisition of new patterns of
expression likely plays a role in the adaptation of Tetrahymen a to its environment.

Background
The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily of genes is one of the largest in the genomes of both
bacteria and eukaryotes [1]. Using hydrolysis of ATP to
ADP to generate energy, ABC transporters move a wide
variety of substrates across membranes, including ions,

sugars, amino acids, polypeptides, toxic metabolites,
xenobiotics, and drugs. Therefore, they provide nutrients
to a cell as well as protect it from both internally produced and exogenous toxins [2,3]. Eukaryotic ABC
transporters usually consist of two types of domains, a
transmembrane domain (TMD) and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). Many ABC proteins include two of
each type of domain and are so-called full transporters.
Others are half transporters, containing one TMD and
one NBD, and generate a functional unit by forming a
homo- or heterodimer [2]. Based on their primary
sequences and the organization of their domains, the

human ABC genes were classified into seven families,
from ABCA to ABCG [4]; an eighth ABCH family was
discovered in the analysis of the Drosophila melanogaster genome [5].
In humans, mutations of many ABC genes are linked
to hereditary disorders, such as adrenoleukodystrophy
and cystic fibrosis [5,6], and proteins coded for by many
genes in the ABC families B, C and G function as drug
efflux transporters [7]. In parasites, products of ABC
genes have been implicated as factors contributing to
resistance against chemotherapeutics [8], and in insects,
ABC genes have been linked to pesticide resistance
[9-11]. These medical and toxicological roles make ABC
transporters important in pharmacological research [12],
therapeutic applications [13], and toxicology [14]. Extensive investigations of ABC transporters in bacteria and
multicellular eukaryotes have been done [5,15-22], but
studies in unicellular eukaryotes other than yeasts have
been limited to parasitic species [23,24]. Clearly, the
ABC transporter superfamily in unicellular free-living
species requires additional study.
Tetrahymena is a free-living ciliated protist found in
freshwater environments around the world [25]. At the
cellular level, its structural and functional complexity is
equal to or greater than that of individual metazoan
cells. Studies on Tetrahymena have led to numerous
scientific breakthroughs, and a number of molecular
genetic technologies and genomic resources have
recently been developed [26-28]. In particular, the Tetrahymena Genome Database (TGD, http://www.ciliate.
org) and Tetrahymena genome expression database
(TGED, http://tged.ihb.ac.cn) [28,29] provide the opportunity for analysis of both the functional and evolutionary characteristics of gene families at the genomic level
in this model organism [30].
In the present study, we identified 165 ABC transporter genes in the Tetrahymena thermophila macronuclear
genome. The locations of introns, evolutionary relationships and expression patterns of these genes were characterized. A detailed analysis showed that the
evolutionary and functional divergence of Tetrahymena
ABC transporters has resulted from a combination of
gene duplication, mutation, pseudogenization, and
changes in gene expression.

Results and Discussion
Identification and classification of ABC transporter genes
in T. thermophila

A total of 165 putative ABC transporter genes were
identified in T. thermophila (Additional file 1), making
it the largest superfamily of ABC transporter genes
described in any species to date. All of the genes could
be grouped into eight families based on organization of
domains, BlastP scores, and placement in phylogenetic

Page 2 of 18

trees. Their phylogenetic relationships are shown in the
ML tree (Figure 1).
The ABCA family comprises 29 full transporters and 4
half transporters. The gene model for one full ABC
transporter gene, ABCA12 (TGD accession NO:
TTHERM_00694300), was predicted incorrectly by
TIGR. Our RT-PCR results showed that this “monster”
gene was, in fact, two full-transporter genes, i.e.,
ABCA12-1 and ABCA12-2 (data not shown). In vertebrates, the ABCA family is composed entirely of full
transporters, and in the plant Arabidopsis all are half
transporters [31]. However, both full and half transporters have been found in another protist, Dictyostelium
[32]. No ABCA genes have been identified in yeast [33]
(Table 1). Three ABCA genes (ABCA1, ABCA8, and
ABCA15) in Tetrahymena are highly similar to the
suABCA gene in sea urchins, which was found in sperm
membrane vesicles and is involved in changing the
immature sperm membrane to produce the terminally
differentiated mature spermatozoa [34]. These three Tetrahymena ABCA genes were markedly up-regulated
during starvation, and the high levels of expression were
maintained during conjugation. Starvation induces physiological changes that prepare cells of different matingtypes to form mating pairs [35]; therefore, these ABCA
genes may be involved in inducing and/or sustaining
conjugation.
The ABCB family consists of 13 full transporters and
13 half transporters. Among those, one full transporter,
ABCB23 (TGD accession NO: TTHERM_00803570),
possesses both one ABCB-like NBD (E-value: 6e-61) and
one ABCC-like NBD (E-value: 3e-50). The mixed structure of this gene was verified by sequencing its cDNA
between the first NBD and second TMD (Additional file
2). The ABCB23 gene was grouped into the ABCB
family according to the higher similarity of its NBD
(lower E-value) to ABCB-like NBD.
Two ABCB genes (ABCB12 and ABCB13) in Tetrahymena were predicted to have a mitochondrial localization by the Predotar program (http://urgi.versailles.inra.
fr/predotar/predotar.html). The half transporter
ABCB12 has an ABC_ATM1 domain (cd03253, E-value:
2e-65 ) that resembles the NBD of human ABCB7 and
the yeast ATM1 gene, both of which are involved in the
transport of the Fe/S binding protein into mitochondria
[36]. There is an ABC_MTABC3 domain (cd03249,
E-value: 1e -63 ) in ABCB13 that resembles the NBD of
human ABCB6, which has been shown to be associated
with iron transport and is located in the mitochondrial
membrane [37].
The human ABCB1 gene MDR1 (multidrug resistance
gene) encodes a well-studied p-glycoprotein that has
been shown to confer resistance to or transport a wide
variety of anticancer agents. The MDR protein is

thought to transport both endo- and xenobiotics and
protect cells from toxic agents [38]. The ABCB15 (TGD
accession NO: TTHERM_00240450) of T. thermophila
shares a 32.3% amino acid identity with MDR1, which is
higher than that between the human p-glycoprotein and
its ortholog STE6 in the yeast (26.2%) [39]. A protein
composed of both 66 and 96 kDa subunits has been
reported to function in T. pyriformis as an efflux pump
similar to mammalian MDR1 [40,41], and a putative
p-glycoprotein in T. pyriformis (GenBank accession No.
CAD55936) has been described. The ABCB15 of

T. thermophila shares a 35.2% amino acid identity with
a putative p-glycoprotein of T. pyriformis and is induced
by DDT, but not by either TCDD or b-estradiol (Additional file 3). Thus, the ABCB15 protein might function
as a substrate-specific MDR,
The ABCC family comprises 60 full transporters and
thus represents the largest family of ABC transporters in
T. thermophila. In the human genome, nine ABCC
genes encode the multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs),
which contain a core domain of TMD similar to pglycoprotein, with the difference that some of them

have an extra TMD at their N-terminal region to form
the structure TMD-TMD-NBD-TMD-NBD. MRPs
transport xenobiotics coupling glutathione (GSH), which
is a major feature distinguishing them from p-gp; therefore MRPs also are recognized as GS-X pumps [38,42].
In T. thermophila, no extra TMD was found at the Nterminal region of ABCC proteins, but an extra
GST_Mu domain was present at the C-terminal region
of ABCC52 (Additional file 1). Xenobiotics are fused
with GSH by glutathione S-transferases at phase II, and
then the complexed substances are transported by
MRPs at phase III, suggesting a coordinated action of
GSTs and MRPs [43]. ABCC52 is a MRP-like gene and
the GST_Mu domain may indicate that it functions
similarly to recognize such GST-complexed substances.
The ABCD family contains only 2 half transporters.
The ABCD families of most other organisms also consist
of a low number of half transporters except for that of
the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, which includes both a
full and a half transporter [44] (Table 1). Members in
this family that have been studied are all targeted to the
peroxisome, where they regulate the transport of longchain fatty acids [45]. In yeast, two ABCD half transporters (Pxa1p and Pxa2p) were found, and these two half
transporters form a heterodimer that functions in the
b-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids [46]; In humans,
there are four ABCD genes [47], the human ABCD1 is
responsible for the X-linked form of adrenoleukodystrophy as a homodimer [48]. The ABCD1 and ABCD2

genes of T. thermophila exhibited the same pattern of
expression (Pearson Correlation Coefficient, PCC =
0.948) during the physiological/developmental stages of
growth, starvation and conjugation (Additional file 4),
suggesting that a heterodimer may also be their functional form.
The ABCE and ABCF families each contain only two
NBDs without TMDs in T. thermophila. Almost all
eukaryotes also have only one ABCE gene except
A. thaliana, which has two [31]. In Tetrahymena, also
one ABCE gene has been identified. In animals, ABCE
has been shown to inhibit RNase L, a double-stranded
RNA nuclease, and is referred to as RLi [49]. Many
intron positions within ABCE1 genes are conserved in
animals and plants, especially in vertebrates (Additional
file 5); therefore, it has been suggested that most of
these introns (e.g., those in human, mouse and rat
ABCE1) were ancestral in nature and that many introns
have been lost in other species (e.g., Ciona intestinalis,
Anopheles gambiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Dictyostelium discoideum, Plasmodium
falciparum) [15]. The ABCE1 of T. thermophila contains
6 introns; however, it shares no intron positions with
ABCE1s of animals and only one with that of Arabidopsis, suggesting that the timing and mechanism of intron
gain and loss in the ABCE1 gene of T. thermophila may
have differed from those of opisthokonts and plants. For
the ABCF family, a well studied gene is the GCN20 of
yeast, which has been shown to regulate translation in

amino acid-starved cells by interaction with eukaryotic
initiation factor 2 (eIF2) and ribosomes [50]. In Tetrahymena, two ABCF genes were found; one of the two
genes (TGD accession NO: TTHERM_01014620)
showed a high expression level in the three stages of
T. thermophila life cycle, indicated a constitutive function of this gene.
The ABCG family includes 3 full transporters and 36
half transporters. Members of the ABCG family are
structured as NBD-TMD or NBD-TMD-NBD-TMD
that have a TMD at the C-terminal region of NBD, an
orientation inverse to that of the ABCA, ABCB, ABCC
and ABCD families. Human ABCG2, first identified in
cells from placentas and breast cancers, is a multidrug
resistance ABC transporter gene different from both
MDR1 or MRP1 and is known as breast cancer resistant
protein (BCRP). A half transporter, BCRP functions as a
homodimer or tetramer bridged with disulfide bonds
[51,52]. Expression of ABCG25 is induced by DDT
T. thermophila, and it shares 31.8% amino acid identity
with BCRP, suggesting that it might have the same basic
function (Additional file 3).
The ABCH family was identified in Drosophila [47],
and lacks members in mammals and C. elegans. The
function of ABCH is unknown. Tetrahymena has 2
ABCH genes, both of which have a single NBD. The
ABCH1 gene of the social amoeba D. discoideum has
the same structure [32]. However, genes of the ABCH
family encode a half transporter with an NBD-TMD
structure in D. melanogaster and A. gambiae [47].
The evolution of ABC transporters in Tetrahymena

All N-terminal NBDs (NBDs-1) and C-terminal NBDs
(NBDs-2) of full transporters and NBDs of half transporters (NBDs-half) were used to construct the ML tree
(Figure 1). It showed that NBDs in the same family clustered together except for the ABCC family (Figure 1).
The relationship of the eight families was similar to that
previously reported in Dictyostelium [32]. Comparative
genomics analyses of ABC transporters suggested that
the ancestral ABC transporters arose before the differentiation of prokaryotes and eukaryotes [53-55]. In another
analysis using 19 evolutionarily diverse eukaryotes, those
NBDs in the same family still cluster together (unpublished result). These results suggest that the eight ABC
transporter families may have diverged prior to the last
universal common ancestor (LUCA) of existing
eukaryotes.
Many proteins are composed of at least two domains,
and it has become clear that the formation of new
domain combinations is an important mechanism in
protein evolution [56]. In most cases, but not always,
the eukaryotic ABC transporters are composed of two
or four domains through various combinations of TMDs

Page 5 of 18

and NBDs. Half transporters are composed of a single
TMD domain fused to an NBD domain, a structural
organization that could be symbolized as TMD-ABC or
ABC-TMD (ABCG family) depending on the N- or
C-terminal location of the TMD domain. Full-size transporters are probably generated by duplication and fusion
of “half-size” transporters and are symbolized as [TMDNBD]2 and [NBD-TMD]2 (ABCG family) [55,57-59]. In
our analysis, three phylogenetic relationships were found
among the three kinds NBDs (NBDs-1 and NBDs-2
from full transporters and NBD-Half from half transporters) in an unrooted tree, corresponding to the ABCA,
ABCB and ACBG families respectively. In the ABCA
family, NBDs-2 (A-2) showed a distant relationship to
NBDs-1 (A-1) and closer relationship to NBDs-Half
(A-Half) (Figure 2), which indicated the possibility that
the ABCA full transporter fused from two distinct half
transporters, which we refer to as “heterogenous” fusion.
In the ABCB family, NBDs-2 (B-2) showed a close relationship to NBDs-1 (B-1) and a more distant relationship to NBDs-Half (B-Half) (Figure 3), which indicated
the possibility that the ABCB full transporter formed by
fusion of two high similarity half transporters, referred
to as “homogenous” fusion. The ABCG family possesses
three full transporters with a reverse domain organization. Neither NBDs-1 (G-1) nor NBDs-2 (G-2) associated into separate cluster but, instead, were dispersed
among the cluster of NBDs-Half (G-Half) (Figure 4).
Since there are no ABCG full genes in the P. tetraurelia
genome, this result indicates that the T. thermophila
ABCG full transporters originated after these two species diverged. NBDs-1 and NBDs-2 of two full genes
(ABCG37 and ABCG38) are in the same group (group4)
(Figure 4), while two NBDs of the other ABCG full
transporter (ABCG39) cluster into two groups (group3
and group5). Although the ancestor could not be determined in an unrooted tree, these three pairs of NBDs
seem to correspond to “homogenous” and “heterogenous” fusions. In addition, the ABCC family members
were all full transporters with distant relationship of
NBDs-1 and NBDs-2, also may have undergone a heterogenous fusion process.
Possession of a large number and variety of ABC
transporters is a significant characteristic of T. thermophila, and we carried out an analysis to discover
whether this results from numerous, lineage-specific
duplications and when these duplications occurred.
First, a phylogeny of NBDs was used to investigate the
evolution of all of the 165 T. thermophila ABC transporter genes, using both full transporters (NBDs-1 and
NBDs-2) and half transporters (NBDs-half) (Figure 1).
A strong correlation was observed between the conservation of intron positions and phylogenetic relationships
of ABC transporters, except for some scattered examples

which may have resulted from recent intron-gain events.
Next, full and half transporters in the ABCA, ABCB,
ABCC, and ABCG families were divided into groups.
Within each group, the locations of introns were conserved, indicating that intron gain and loss had occurred
before the evolutionary expansion of each family. The
ABCA, ABCB, ABCC, and ABCG families were massively expanded, containing 17 clusters of tandem repeat
genes that comprised a total of 58 genes (Table 2). The
ABCG family had the most clusters, six with a total of
29 genes, and its largest single cluster had 11 tandem
genes. The sequence identities of proteins in each tandem cluster ranged widely (50%-80%) and correlated
with values of Ks for these tandem genes. However, several tandem repeats had a low Ks (0.1169-0.3109) (Figure 5), and notably, genes within tandem clusters were
more closely related to each other than to those in
other clusters. This suggests either that duplication
events had occurred relatively recently within the clusters of tandem genes or that some mechanism results in
the concerted evolution of these genes.
The ABCA family can be divided into 6 groups
including two groups of half transporters (groups 5-6 in
Figure 2) and four groups of full transporters (groups1-4
in Figure 2), suggesting that Tetrahymena inherited at
least 6 ABCA transporter genes from its ancestor.
Regarding the expansion of full transporter genes, it was
significant that the tree topologies of full transporter
NBDs-1 and NBDs-2 were surprisingly similar (Figure
2). This suggests that these genes evolved as full transporters first and then became expanded. Thus, three
genes ancestral to full transporters expanded to form
groups1-4, containing 2, 8, 9 and 10 genes, respectively
(Figure 2b).
Similar phenomena also were observed in the ABCB
(Figure 3) and ABCC families (data not shown). The
ABCG family differed from the others in being composed mainly of expanded half transporters–5 ancestral
genes expanded to 2, 6, 5, 15 and 9 genes, respectively
(Figure 4b). More than 90% of the ABCG genes in Tetrahymena are half transporters that are more similar to
one another in their sequences than to other ABC transporter families (data not shown), which indicates either

very recent expansion, higher negative selection or
highly concerted evolution of these genes.
After the phylogenetic analysis of NBDs within Tetrahymena, we compared the detailed compositions of
ABC transporter families in Tetrahymena to those of
other eukaryotes (Table 1). Tetrahymena, with a predicted proteome of 24725 genes, possesses 53 more
ABC transporter genes than those of P. tetraurelia, its
closest sequenced free-living ciliate which has been
shown to have undergone three whole genome duplications (WGDs) [60] resulting in a predicted proteome of
39642 genes. Tetrahymena and Paramecium probably
branched off ~800 Mya, yet only 23 orthologs of ABC
transporters between Paramecium and Tetrahymena
were found using a reciprocal Blast search (see methods); therefore, 86% of ABC genes in Tetrahymena
appear to have evolved after divergence of these two
species. The pairwise Ks values of 7 sets of ABC transporter genes (see methods) fell mainly between 1.2-2.2
(Figure 5). Rebecca et al (2006) compared the evolutionary rates of proteins among animals, plants and ciliates
using Ka/Ks and concluded that the genomic architecture of ciliates has experienced the highest rate of evolution, at least 1.6-2.6 times greater than in any other
major group of eukaryotes investigated to date [61]. An
overall rate of 9.76 mutations per silent site per billion
years in Tetrahymena can be calculated using the overall
rate of mutations in Arabidopsis (6.1 per silent site per
billion years) as a basis for calculation, with a normalization of 1.6 fold, [62]. If this is correct, then most of the
duplications of ABC genes in T. thermophila probably
occurred between 61.5-112.7 Mya ago. However, it
should be noted that this is a preliminary estimate, and
further analysis of the general rate of protein evolution
at the genomic level will be required for a more precise
calculation.
Comparisons of Tetrahymena with other alvelolate
protists, such as the apicomplexans Babesia bovis and
Plasmodium yoelii, or more distantly related model
organisms, such as S. cerevisiae, D. discoideum, A. thaliana and H. sapiens, also suggest that the superfamily of
ABC transporters in Tetrahymena not only has a higher
absolute number of genes but also represents a higher
percentage of the predicted proteome (Table 1). The
large size of this family in Tetrahymena may result from
either an increased rate of gene duplication or a low
rate of loss. Moreover, it has been shown in Tetrahymena that only genes associated with sensing of and
responding to environmental changes (e.g., kinases, voltage-gated ion channels, P-type ATPases and transporter
genes) have undergone such large-scale, lineage-specific
expansions resulting in a higher number of genes than
in other eukaryotic taxa, including the other free-living
protists [27]. This suggests that the enlargement of

several ABC transporter families in T. thermophila
resulted from relatively a high duplication rate.
Functional divergence of ABC gene duplicates in
Tetrahymena

Gene duplication is a primary source of new genes with
novel or altered functions [63], and a comprehensive
classification of all models for the evolution and maintenance of gene duplication has been provided in a recent
review [64]. A study of the patterns of expression is one
important measure of functions of a gene that could
facilitate understanding of the genetic basis of evolutionary change [65,66]. The extensive duplications of genes
in the ABC transporter superfamily of Tetrahymena
provide a particularly good opportunity to investigate
the functional consequences of gene duplication in a
single organism.
Figure 6 shows a heat map illustrating the overall
expression profiles of ABC transporters in T. thermophila during different physiological/developmental conditions. Three categories could be identified based on
cluster analysis: 1) silent genes or those with low expression levels (some points may silent) (Figure 6a); 2) genes
expressed only under specific conditions (Figure 6b); 3)
genes with high expression levels for all the experimental conditions (Figure 6c). Seven sets of duplicates of
ABC genes in the four largest families (ABCA, ABCB,
ABCC and ABCG) were selected for analysis of the evolution of their gene-expression patterns. Among these,
one set was fit best with the Non-phylogenetic/Free
model, and the others all fit best with the Pure-phylogenetic/free model (Table 3). The Pure-phylogenetic
model assumes that changes in gene expression

occurred on every branch of the phylogeny and that
there were neither loss of functions within a gene family
in the course of this process nor sporadic changes in
gene expression [66]. Thus, either pseudogenization or
functional divergence might have occurred in the cases
of those six sets of ABC transporter genes.
We attempted to separate the effects of different
modes of duplicate retention by categorizing the expression profile into four types (see methods) for the seven
sets of gene duplicates and inferring their ancestral
expression states for a comparison. Tandem duplicates
of ABC transporters were chosen to represent relatively
recent duplications, there being nine such duplicates
distributed in six sets of genes (Figure 7). In addition,
analyses of those gene sets were performed where
applicable, including calculation of Ka/Ks values and
sites under positive selection, the possibility of forming
a heterodimer, and the inducibility to toxic exposure as
accessory evidence. The following four different models
could be inferred from these nine pairs of duplicates
(Table 4).
• Neofunctionalization for four pairs. 1) The ACBA15ABCA16 pair is likely to be undergoing a coding level
neofunctionalization, since many sites were detected
under positive selection for this pair (Table 4). The loss
of expression in one copy could have been shaped by a
reduction of the formerly high constitutive expression,
to perform a novel function related to, for example, a
rare or low-concentration xenobiotics. 2) the ABCA17ABCA18 pair showed the same expression pattern for
the ancestral state and two descendants. Similar to the
ABCA15-ABCA16, this pair has undergone coding-level
neofunctionalization given the relatively high age of the

of color as determined from microarray data indicated along the top (From left to right). The color scale is as follows: dark color, low expression;
light color, high expression. Levels of expression were obtained for 20 points in time during three physiological/development stages of the life
cycle of Tetrahymena: For growing cells, L-l, L-m and L-h correspond to ~1×105 cells/ml, ~3.5×105 cells/ml and ~1×106 cells/ml, respectively. For
measurements of expression during starvation, ~2×105 cells/ml were collected at intervals of 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 24 hours (referred to as S-0, S3, S-6, S-9, S-12, S-15 and S-24, respectively). For measurements of expression during conjugation, equal volumes of B2086 and CU428 cells
were mixed together in culture, and samples were collected at intervals of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 hours after mixing (referred to as C0, C-2, C-4, C-6, C-8, C-10, C-12, C-14, C-16 and C-18, respectively). The following three categories could be identified: a, silent genes or those
with low expression levels (some points may silent); b, genes highly expressed only for specific conditions; c, genes with continuous high
expression levels.

selection (Table 4). 3) the ABCB17-ABCB18 pair had
the same type of expression in the ancestral state as the
two genes in the pair (Table 4), whereas the ABCB17
gene could be induced by exposure to DDT (unpublished data), suggesting that ABCB17 might have
evolved a new functional role. 4) the ABCC10-ABCC11
pair was inferred as having an ancestral state of high
expression for specific conditions still found in the
ABCC11 gene, but ABCC10 showed a continuous high
level of expression (Table 4). Furthermore, positive

selection on some sites also was detected in the four
pairs (Table 4); therefore, the neofunctionalization
model was determined to be the best one.
• Subfunctionalization for one pair. The subfunctionalization model implies that duplicates partitioned the
function of the ancestral gene and underwent a reciprocal rapid, partial loss of function [67,68]. Two expression patterns would be consistent with this model:
ancestral ubiquitous expression followed by both duplicates specializing their expression patterns, or high
ancestral expression levels with low duplicated pair
expression levels (that add up to the previous high

level). In our analysis, the ABCB1-ABCB2 showed a
relatively recent duplication (with low Ks), and more
important, the ancestral state may have shown both
expression patterns of the descendants prior to duplication (Table 4), therefore, this pair is the most probable
duplicates for subfunctionalization. However, simple
gradual pseudogenization is another possible explanation
for this pair.
• Dosage balance for two pairs. The dosage balance
model implies a positive selection for fixation of the
duplicates, with both descendants maintaining the original function showing signs of negative selection at the

coding level in preservation phase. This model may
apply to genes involved in transport [69] and proteinprotein interactions [70]. With low Ka/Ks values, two
pairs (ABCB10-ABCB11 and ABCG23-ABCG24) showed
the same type of expression in the ancestral state as in
both duplicates, and these two pairs possibly form heterodimers based on their co-expression PCC values
(Table 4), indicating a dosage balance model for these
two pairs. The expressed macronuclear genome of Tetrahymena is effectively polyploid (45 copies of each gene
on average); however, the retention of both members of a
gene pair after duplication to enable an increase in the
level of response to match exposure to substances (i.e.,
increased dosage) may still play a role in the evolution of
ABC transporter genes in T. thermophila.
• Pseudogenization for one pair. The tandem duplicate
ABCG31-ABCG32 showed a silent state during the
entire life cycle of the T. thermophila (Table 4), and no
evidence of transcriptional inducibility from exposure to
several toxic substances. The parsimonious ancestral
expression state of this pair was also silent (Figure 7).
Since the duplication is fairly old and the pairwise Ka/
Ks hints at negative selective pressure operating until
quite recently (Table 4), thus, a recent, rapid pseudogenization of both duplicates seems the most probable
explanation.
•Uncertain model for one pair. In the ABCC52ABCC54 pair, one descendant (ABCA52) has a high
expression level similar to that inferred for the ancestral
state, and the other descendant (ABCA54) showed a
specific expression pattern. Given the relatively high age
of the duplication (high Ks), this pair seems unlikely to
be involved in a slow, step-wise subfunctionalization
because expression loss of te one copy is expected to be
a rapid process. Since only two sites have been detected
under positive selection, the possibility that this pair
underwent a coding-level neofunctionalization process is
also seemingly low. A gradual pseudogenization process
that led to the step-wise loss of expression in one copy
was possible, where such loss would have to be relatively
recent due to the low Ka/Ks values of this pair. However, the lack of certainty in regard with their ancestral
state further made the situation less clear. Therefore, we
thought it is hard to suggest one best model for the
ABCC52-ABCC54 pair.
Network asymmetry in which one gene in a pair
acquired more co-expressed genes than the other (Additional file 6) could be identified in many tandem duplicate pairs in the seven sets of genes, indicating that each
of the two duplicate genes could be involved in a different pathway or biological process. A similar phenomenon also has been reported in yeast [71]. Finally, six
genes were found to be up-regulated under stress from
DDT and one by exposure to TBT (unpublished data).

Page 14 of 18

This of suggests that there may be more duplicates that
have been preserved in the genome through neofunctionalization or dosage balance.

Conclusion
T. thermophila possesses a total of 165 ABC transporter
genes, the largest number in this superfamily reported
for any organism to date. The reason for Tetrahymena
having so many ABC transporters is probably related to
its lifestyle as a highly dispersed, free-living unicellular
organism. For multicellular organisms and parasites, the
cells are in more stable environments, whereas Tetrahymena must survive exposure to all the substances and
organisms in the fresh water that surrounds it, and thus
would benefit from having a large number of diverse
genes to enable it to sense and respond to this correspondingly diverse and ever-changing set of environmental conditions. There is evidence that these genes have
undergone lineage-specific expansions [27], creating a
large, diverse complement of ABC transporters that
could be involved in the efficient efflux of numerous
endogenously produced toxins or elimination of a broad
range of xenobiotics. The phylogenetic analyses, characterization of intron positions, and ortholog comparisons
performed in the present study facilitated both the identification of progenitor genes and formation of strong
hypotheses to explain the evolutionary origin and expansion of the ABC transporter superfamily in Tetrahymena.
Our analyses indicated that the fusion of domains or half
transporter genes played a role in the evolution of the
diversity of ABC transporters in Tetrahymena along with
gene expansion by duplication. These duplicates appear
to have experienced subsequent divergence by accumulation of mutations and differences in expression patterns.
Multiple different mechanisms including neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization, pseudogenization and
dosage balance appear to account for this functional
divergence.
Methods
Identification of genes

To identify ABC transporter genes in Tetrahymena, we
first searched for predicted ABC transporters genes in
the TIGR database (ftp://ftp.tigr.org/pub/data/Eukaryotic_Projects/t_thermophila/Transporter/) and extracted
the 160 genes annotated as ABC transporters. These
ABC transporters were divided into full transporters and
half transporters, which were aligned separately to identify sequences of NBDs. The NBD sequences then were
used to perform a BlastP search (default setting) in
TGD [29] to identify other genes with an NBD-like
sequence. A total of 185 genes were found, including 1
homolog of Rad50, 4 in the SMC family, 7 in the Muts
family, 9 with partial NBD sequences, and 164 with

Xiong et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:330
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/330

complete NBDs. The DNA sequences of these 164 genes
were used to do a BlastN search of the NCBI EST database and TBestDB (http://amoebidia.bcm.umontreal.ca/
pepdb/searches/login.php), and the EST information of
every gene was examined to determine whether there
were any incorrectly predicted genes. RT-PCR was carried out to verify the cDNA sequences, and as a result,
one incorrectly predicted gene was separated into two
genes, giving a total of 165 predicted ABC transporter
genes with complete NBDs. The protein sequences of
these 165 predicted genes were used to perform BlastP
searches in the NCBI non-redundant protein database,
and hit scores and E-values were sufficient to sort the
majority of the ABC transporter genes into 8 families
(several sophisticated genes having to be determined by
constructing a phylogenetic tree) [32]. The nomenclature for human ABC families (http://www.genenames.
org/genefamily/abc.html) was used to name all ABC
transporter genes in Tetrahymena. Orthologs with genes
in Paramecium were detected as the reciprocal best hits
in the Blast search, using all the 165 T. thermophila
ABC genes as the query.
Sequence alignment, phylogenetic analysis, and intron
mapping

Owing to the difference in length of half and full ABC
transporters, we used the NBDs for phylogenetic analysis of ABC transporters. All NBDs were sorted into the
following three types: 1) NBDs of half transporters were
given the same name as the gene (e.g. ABCA29); 2) Nterminal NBDs from full transporters were given their
name of their gene followed by .1 (e.g. ABCA1.1); and
3) C-terminal NBDs from full transporters were given
the name of their gene followed by .2 (e.g. ABCA1.2).
The protein sequences of all NBDs were aligned using
MAFFT (http://align.bmr.kyushu-u.ac.jp/mafft/online/
server/index.html) and the matrix Blosum45. Then, the
alignment was trimmed using the Trimal program [72]
with the option -gt 0.1, and a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using PhyML [73] with
100 bootstrap iterations.
All nucleotide sequences of NBDs were used to map
introns. First, each ABC transporter cDNA sequence
was aligned with the scaffold sequence to find the position of the introns. Second, the alignment of NBD protein sequences was back-translated into a DNA
alignment (codon alignment) of NBDs using RevTrans
(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/RevTrans/). Finally, the
introns in the NBD regions were mapped manually into
the codon alignment of NBD DNA sequences.
Microarray data

The microarray data were retrieved from the Tetrahymena
Gene Expression Database (TGED, http://tged.ihb.ac.cn/).

Page 15 of 18

This included the normalized microarray data published
by in Miao et al [28] in which the microarray data of each
gene consists of an expression profile containing 20 time
points from three stages in the life cycle of T. thermophila,
including 3 time-dependent points of growth, 7 timedependent points of starvation, and 10 time-dependent
points of conjugation. The heat map of the ABC transporter genes was calculated using the program ArrayStar version 2.0 (DNASTAR, Inc, Madison, WI).
Tetrahymena strains, culture conditions, and toxicity
experiments

The wild-type strain SB210 of T. thermophila was provided by Dr. E. Orias, University of California, Santa
Barbara, and strain CU428 was provided by Dr. P.J.
Bruns, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY. Cells were grown
in SPP medium at 30°C [74]. Dr. Y. Xu, Institute of
Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China provided TCDD, which was dissolved in DMSO (Sigma) for
use; b-estradiol was purchased from Sigma. Preparation
of DDT was performed as previously described [75]. Aliquots from stock solutions of TCDD, DDT, and b-estradiol were added to culture medium to produce final
concentrations of 1 ppb, 4 ppm, and 1 ppb. Cells from
stock cultures of CU428 in early stationary phase
(~2×105 cells/ml) were inoculated into TCDD, DDT, or
b-estradiol-treated media and incubated for 24 hours at
30°C. The same volume of DMSO used in treatment
cultures also was included in cultures used as negative
controls.
Total RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and real-time PCR

Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit
(Qiagen) after cells were homogenized with QIAshredder (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA integrity was verified using a Bioanalyzer
2100 (Agilent). RNA samples were treated with DNase
(Promega) and subsequently were reverse transcribed
into double stranded cDNA using M-MLV reverse transcriptase RNase H+ (TOYOBO). Real-time PCR reactions and calculation of the relative expression levels of
ABCB15 and ABCG25 were the same as previously
described [76].
Analyzing evolution of gene expression and inferring
ancestral state of expression

The procedure used for analyzing evolution of gene
expression followed the steps described in [66]. First,
the pairwise similarity was calculated using FASTA
(http://fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/fasta_www2/fasta_www.
cgi). Then, the following two criteria described in [66]
were used to partition the superfamily of ABC transporters: 1) sequences must contain a FASTA-alignable
region that comprises greater than 80% of the longer

Xiong et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:330
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/330

protein; 2) two genes resemble each other more than a
specified threshold (35%). Based on these criteria, 7 sets
of genes were identified that were suitable for analysis
of the evolution of gene expression, including 2 sets
each in the ABCA, ABCB, and ABCC families and 1 set
in the ABCG family. Protein sequences of each set of
genes were aligned using MAFFT. Then the alignments
were back translated into the codon alignment of DNA
sequences using RevTrans.
The GTR+I+G model of evolution was selected by
ModelTest [77], and ML trees were constructed by
PAUP 4.0b10 [78]. The microarray data of each gene
from 20 points in time were log2-base transformed and
represented the character data of taxa tips. Then, both
the phylogenetic trees and the log-transformed microarray data were input as a set of continuous data into the
program CoMET [79]. Using default settings, 9 maximum likelihood models of the evolution of gene expression were compared according to the Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC), and the model with the
minimum AIC value was chosen as the best fitting
model of evolution of gene expression.
To estimate the best fitting model of the evolution of
duplicated ABC genes, the expression pattern of each of
the 7 sets of genes was characterized according to the
following system of four types based on the heat map of
expression over 20 time points in the life cycle of
T. thermophila: 0, silent; 1, low expression (some points
may silent); 2, specific high expression (in terms of
point or stage); 3, continuous high expression. The
ancestral expression states were constructed by parsimony and likelihood methods with the program Mesquite [80] using the four types of expression states (0, 1,
2 and 3) as characters of taxa.
PCC calculation, searching for candidate co-expressed
genes, and detection of the positive selection

Information on the co-expression of genes of T. thermophila was found in TGED. The Pearson Correlation
Coefficient (PCC) of a pair of genes was calculated
using a C++-compiled program (available upon request).
Candidates for co-expressed genes were identified by
the PCC using a threshold of 0.8 (This threshold guaranteed including most genes in KEGG-predicted conserved pathways between T. thermophila and other
eukaryotes). Every ABC transporter gene in the 7 sets
was searched in TGED, and the candidates for coexpressed genes were obtained. To measure the difference in numbers of candidate co-expressed genes, we
adopted the following two methods: 1) calculating the
quotient (high number/low number) of candidate coexpressed genes between two genes in a pair and 2) calculating the difference (high number-low number) in
candidate co-expressed genes between two genes in a

Page 16 of 18

pair. Finally, the percentage of pairs in which the quotient > 2 and the difference > 100 was calculated.
The set of 7 genes identified by the procedures given
above were used to analyze evolutionary patterns of
divergence in expression of genes. Their nucleotide
sequences were aligned codon by codon, using the
aligned protein sequences as guides, and an ML tree of
each set was constructed using PhyML. Then, positive
selection was tested by PAML using the branch
(Model0), site (Nsites = 1, 2, 7 and 8) and branch-site
(Model A, specifying the two tandem repeats as foreground lineage) models [81]. In addition, the
non-synonymous substitution (Ka) and synonymous
substitution (Ks) for gene pairs in each set also were
calculated.
Microarray data accession numbers

Microarray data have been deposited with the NCBI Gene
Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo)
under accession numbers listed in document S11 in Miao
et al [28] ... (doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0004429).
