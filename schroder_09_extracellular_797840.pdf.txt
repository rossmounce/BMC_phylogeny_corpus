Abstract
Background: The EXO (EXORDIUM) gene was identified as a potential mediator of
brassinosteroid (BR)-promoted growth. It is part of a gene family with eight members in
Arabidopsis. EXO gene expression is under control of BR, and EXO overexpression promotes
shoot and root growth. In this study, the consequences of loss of EXO function are described.
Results: The exo loss of function mutant showed diminished leaf and root growth and reduced
biomass production. Light and scanning electron microscopy analyses revealed that impaired leaf
growth is due to reduced cell expansion. Epidermis, palisade, and spongy parenchyma cells were
smaller in comparison to the wild-type. The exo mutant showed reduced brassinolide-induced
cotyledon and hypocotyl growth. In contrast, exo roots were significantly more sensitive to the
inhibitory effect of synthetic brassinolide. Apart from reduced growth, exo did not show severe
morphological abnormalities. Gene expression analyses of leaf material identified genes that
showed robust EXO-dependent expression. Growth-related genes such as WAK1, EXP5, and KCS1,
and genes involved in primary and secondary metabolism showed weaker expression in exo than in
wild-type plants. However, the vast majority of BR-regulated genes were normally expressed in
exo. HA- and GFP-tagged EXO proteins were targeted to the apoplast.
Conclusion: The EXO gene is essential for cell expansion in leaves. Gene expression patterns and
growth assays suggest that EXO mediates BR-induced leaf growth. However, EXO does not
control BR-levels or BR-sensitivity in the shoot. EXO presumably is involved in a signalling process
which coordinates BR-responses with environmental or developmental signals. The hypersensitivity of exo roots to BR suggests that EXO plays a diverse role in the control of BR responses in
the root.

Background
Multiple pathways control growth and development. BRs
received particular attention when BR-deficient and BRinsensitive mutants were identified [1]. Loss of BR action

results in extreme dwarfism. Leaves, internodes, and
roots of BR-mutants show reduced size and growth of
reproductive organs can be impaired [2]. The growthpromoting effect of BR is largely based on the promotion

of cell expansion, though BR may also enhance cell
proliferation in leaves [3]. The most prominent direct
BR-effect is the modification of gene expression patterns.
In fact, BR action requires genomic events, and numerous approaches have identified BR-regulated genes [4, 5].
The identified genes and physiological studies suggest
that BR controls cell wall modifications, organisation of
microtubules and cellulose microfibrils, aquaporin
activity, and photosynthesis [2, 6]. BR-regulated genes
also include putative signalling components, among
these the EXO protein (At4g08950) [7, 8]. EXO gene
expression is a strong indicator of BR-responses in
vegetative tissues. BR-deficient mutants showed weak
EXO expression, whereas BR application to the wild-type
resulted in elevated EXO transcript levels [7]. The BRhypersensitive bes1-D mutant exhibited constitutive EXO
expression [9]. EXO overexpression resulted in stronger
shoot and root growth in wild-type plants [7]. However,
overexpression of EXO in the BR-deficient dwf1-6 mutant
did not normalize dwarfism [7]. EXO action apparently
requires the presence of further BR-dependent factors.
The transgenic line AtEM201 contains a T-DNA insertion
in the EXO promoter. The EXO mRNA level was strongly
reduced in these plants. However, the plants did not
show an abnormal phenotype [8]. Likewise, inhibition
of EXO expression by means of RNA interference did not
result in an abnormal phenotype [7]. The lack of
phenotypic changes in either approach could be due to
genetic redundancy, or the exo mutant phenotype could
become evident only under certain growth conditions.
Alternatively, the remaining EXO mRNA in the AtEM210
and RNAi lines could be sufficient to maintain proper
protein levels [7, 8].
Here we report on the characterization of an exo knockout mutant that shows dwarfism. We show that
diminished growth of exo is due to reduced cell
expansion rather than impaired cell proliferation. EXO
is an extracellular protein that modifies BR-induced
growth responses. Expression profiling experiments
identified EXO-regulated genes. The potential molecular
mode of action of EXO is discussed.

Results
The EXO/EXL protein family
Eight homologous proteins including EXO form a
protein family in Arabidopsis (see Additional file 1,
Figure S1). Structurally conserved proteins were identified in dicots such as tobacco [10], potato [11], wine
grape and black cottonwood, and monocots such as rice
and Sorghum bicolor, the conifer Picea sitchensis, and the
moss Physcomitrella patens. The genome of the soil
bacterium Solibacter usitatus also encodes a putative

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/20

PHI1/EXO-like protein of 317 amino acids (see Additional file 2). No further homologs were identified in
bacteria, archaea, fungi, animals, and protists. A phylogenetic tree is shown in Figure S2. The conserved region
comprises almost the complete primary structure of
about 300 amino acids (Interpro entry IPR006766;
PFAM entry PF04674).
EXO and EXL expression patterns
The AtGenExpress development series [12] was used to
analyze transcript levels in different organs. Strong EXO
expression was observed in rosette leaves, cotyledons,
and roots. Senescing leaves and pollen displayed little
EXO expression (Figure 1). Flower organs (i.e., sepals,
petals, stamens, and pedicels) had varying mRNA levels.
The EXO-Like1 (EXL1), EXL3, and EXL5 genes showed
expression patterns similar to EXO (Figure 1). The
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was calculated
for the EXO/EXL gene pairs (see Additional file 1, Table
S1). Expression of the EXL1 gene (At1g35140) was
closely associated with EXO expression. The correlation
coefficient accounted for r = 0.71 in all profiles and
r = 0.87 in profiles of vegetative tissues (without flower
organs and pollen). EXL3 (At5g51550) and EXL5
(At2g17230) gene expression correlated positively with
EXO expression as well (see Additional file 1, Table S1).
Associated expression of genes may indicate a common
role in physiological processes or pathways. Interestingly, EXL1, EXL3, and EXL5 expression was also induced
by BR (see Additional file 1, Table S2). In contrast,
mRNA levels of the remaining four EXL genes (i.e., EXL2
[At5g64260], EXL4 [At5g09440], EXL6 [At3g02970], and
EXL7 [At2g35150]) were not altered upon BR-application, and were not associated with EXO expression
(see Additional file 1, Figure S3, Figure S4, Table S1).
The EXO protein is required for shoot and root growth
An exo knock-out mutant (SALK 098602) [13] was
identified which carries a single insertion in the EXO
coding sequence (see Additional file 1, Figure S1).
Growth of exo plants was reduced in soil and in synthetic
medium (Figure 2). Fresh weight and dry weight of exo
shoots were diminished in comparison to the wild-type.
The exo plants produced 50 to 60% of the wild-type fresh
and dry weight in six independent experiments
(Table 1). In further independent growth experiments,
biomass production was reduced to a variable extent. In
three experiments, exo fresh weight was reduced to
approximately 40% of the wild-type level, whereas in
three other experiments the mutant produced up to 81%
of the wild-type fresh weight (see Additional file 1, Table
S3). Differences in biomass production of soil-grown
plants may depend on the light conditions which could
not be fully controlled in the greenhouse.

EXO, EXL1, EXL3, and EXL5 gene expression in different organs and developmental stages. Wild-type expression
profiles of the development series [12] were downloaded from AtGenExpress and normalized using RMA-Express. The mean
and SD of three replicates are shown.
Root length of plants grown on vertically oriented plates
was determined. 14, 21, and 31 d old exo roots were 30,
24, and 19% shorter in comparison to the wild-type,
respectively (Table 2). Loss of EXO function did not
affect organ formation. For example, the regular number
of flower organs was formed, and fertility was not
impaired. The exo mutant showed a slight tendency to
delayed flowering. The opposite trend was observed in
35S::EXO plants (C24 background [7]; data not shown).
An EXO overexpression construct (termed 35S::EXOga)
was transformed into the exo mutant. EXO expression

under control of the 35S promoter restored the wild-type
phenotype (Figure 2C). Expression of an EXO:HA fusion
protein under control of the 35S promoter also restored
the wild-type phenotype in exo (Figure 2E). These results
demonstrate that the mutant phenotype was caused by
the T-DNA insertion in the EXO coding sequence.
Another T-DNA insertion line (SALK 098601) was supposed
to carry a T-DNA insertion in the EXO coding sequence. In
fact, PCR using the LBb1 primer (for left border of T-DNA
insertion, see http://signal.salk.edu/tdnaprimers.2.html)

and an antisense primer for the 3'UTR of EXO resulted in a
0.7 kb fragment and confirmed an insertion in the EXO
coding sequence. However, no homozygous mutant plants
were identified though all plants were resistant to kanamycin. Therefore, the mutant was back-crossed with the Col-0
wild-type and the F2 generation was screened for homozygous plants. PCR analysis of 96 plants indicated that none
carried an insertion in the EXO gene in both chromosomes.
This observation may suggest that a second insertion close
to the EXO gene impaired development of homozygous
plants.

wall (Figure 4A). Only weak background fluorescence
was detected in non-transgenic Col-0 plants. Furthermore, a 35S::EXO:GFP construct was stably introduced
into Arabidopsis wild-type plants. Green fluorescence
was detected in the apoplast. Plasmolysed cells showed
fluorescence in the apoplast as well (Figure 4B). These
findings are in line with the predictions of sequence
analysis tools such as TargetP http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/
services/TargetP/[16] and Predotar http://urgi.versailles.
inra.fr/predotar/predotar.html[17] which state that all
members of the Arabidopsis EXO/EXL protein family are
cell wall-associated. In addition, proteomics approaches
also identified the EXO, EXL1, EXL2, EXL3, and EXL4
proteins as part of the cell wall proteome [18-21]. Thus,
EXO is an extracellular protein, and the other members
of the protein family are also likely to be transported
into the apoplast.

Loss of EXO results in reduced cell size
Leaf size is determined by variation in cell size and
number. Small leaf size of exo could be based on
impaired cell expansion, cell proliferation, or a combination of both. Rosette leaves of wild-type and exo
were subjected to anatomical analysis. Leaf thickness
(Table 3) and leaf area were reduced in exo (Figure 2,
Figure 3D). Epidermal cells of exo and wild-type plants
were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and found to be smaller in the exo mutant
(Figure 3A). Histological analysis of subepidermal
palisade cells in mature rosette leaves revealed reduced
cell expansion in exo (Figure 3B). Furthermore, transverse sections of fully expanded leaves showed that
palisade and spongy parenchyma cell areas in exo were
significantly smaller in comparison to the wild-type
(Table 3). Thus, EXO is required for cell expansion.

Dwarf mutants are frequently characterized by both
smaller cells and a decrease in the total number of
palisade cells [14, 15]. The total number of palisade cells
of the 5th or 6th rosette leaf was estimated. The exo
mutant showed a tendency to fewer cells in comparison
to the wild-type, but differences were not consistent in
independent experiments (data not shown). Thus, EXO
has no major effect on leaf cell number of soil-grown
plants.

EXO modifies BR responses
Wild-type, exo, and complemented exo plants were grown
under aseptic conditions in the presence of different
brassinolide (BL) concentrations. Cotyledon length,
cotyledon width, hypocotyl length, and root length
were determined. In the absence of exogenous BL,
cotyledon length and cotyledon width were significantly
reduced in exo compared to wild-type and complemented exo plants (Figure 5). BR application resulted in
larger cotyledons. However, the relative increase was
significantly reduced in exo (Figure 5A and Additional
file 1). Introduction of the 35S::EXOga construct normalized cotyledon growth. Hypocotyls were slightly longer
in exo in the absence of BR (t-test, P < 0.001). The exo
hypocotyls showed a diminished response to BL.
Relative hypocotyl elongation was significantly reduced
in comparison to the wild-type (Figure 5B and Additional file 1). The observations suggest that EXO is
required for BR-induced growth in above ground organs.

EXO is an apoplastic protein
The subcellular localisation of EXO was analyzed using
an HA-tagged EXO protein under control of the 35S
promoter. Introduction of the 35S::EXO:HA construct
into the exo background normalized growth (Figure 2E),
demonstrating that the fusion protein is functional.
Western-blot analysis showed that the EXO:HA protein
was stable in the transgenic plants (Figure 2E). The 35S::
EXO:HA construct was transformed into Col-0 wild-type
plants, and leaves of transgenic plants were embedded in
Technovit 8100. The EXO:HA protein was detected using
an anti-HA antibody and a secondary antibody coupled
to FITC. The EXO:HA protein was detected in the cell

The BR-response of roots was also tested. Inhibition of
root growth by BL was significantly increased in exo
compared to the wild-type (Figure 5C and Additional

file 1). Introduction of the 35S::EXOga construct normalized exo root growth. Thus, loss of EXO results in BRhypersensitive roots. Since this finding does not hold
true for shoot organs, which are less BR-responsive in exo
plants, the EXO protein may play a diverse and tissuespecific role in the control of BR responses in the root.
EXO-dependent gene expression
Wild-type and exo plants were grown in a greenhouse for
35 days in three independent experiments. Affymetrix
ATH1 microarrays were hybridized with labelled cRNA
prepared from above ground plant material. Ten genes
(including EXO) showed significantly weaker expression
in the exo mutant than in wild-type plants. WAK1 (Wall-

Associated Kinase 1) [22] transcript levels were reduced
approximately 2.5-fold in the mutant. Five genes showed
significantly stronger expression in exo (Table 4). Several
other up- and down-regulated genes encode enzymes of
the primary or secondary metabolism.
The BR-regulated EXP5 and KCS1 genes were previously
reported to be under control of EXO in Arabidopsis C24
plants [7]. Expansins play an essential role in cell wall
loosening [23], and the fatty acid elongase, KCS1,
catalyses very long chain fatty acid synthesis in vegetative
tissues [24]. Real-time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated
weaker EXP5 and KCS1 expression in the exo mutant in
comparison to Col-0 wild-type plants (Table 5). The

differences in KCS1 and EXP5 transcript levels diminished with increasing plant age (Table 5). Similar
development-dependent differences in KCS1 and EXP5
expression were also observed in plants grown in
synthetic medium (data not shown). Weak KCS1 and
EXP5 expression may represent one reason for diminished BR-induced growth in exo shoots.
However, the vast majority of known BR-regulated genes
(including genes involved in BR-biosynthesis, BR-catabolism, and BR-signalling) did not show significantly
altered transcript levels in exo. In line with this finding,
we previously showed that EXO overexpression does not
result in altered transcript levels of BR-regulated genes
such as DWF4 and CPD [7]. Thus, EXO is not a key
control element for BR-responsive gene expression in the
shoot.

Discussion
Structure and subcellular localisation
EXO:GFP and EXO:HA fusion proteins were detected in
the apoplast (Figure 4). Other extracellular proteins such

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/20

as arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs) are attached to the
plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI) anchor. However, analysis of the EXO primary
structure did not reveal a GPI modification site, and
plasmolysis experiments showed that the EXO protein
was not associated with the plasma membrane
(Figure 4). Cell wall proteins are embedded in a
polysaccharide matrix and it can be difficult to extract
them. Bayer et al. [18] identified the EXO, EXL1
(At1g35140), and EXL2 (At5g64260) proteins in extensively washed cell wall preparations. This finding
suggests a tight association with the wall. On the other
hand, Borderies et al. [19] recovered extracellular
proteins by washing Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures
with salts and chelating agents. They aimed to identify
loosely bound cell wall proteins and results were
critically evaluated with respect to the integrity of the
plasma membrane of the cells. EXO was among the 50
identified proteins. In line with the observation of
Borderies et al. [19], HA-tagged EXO protein could be
extracted readily from 35S::EXO:HA transgenic plants
using a standard method for the isolation of soluble
proteins (Figure 2E). Thus, a fraction of the EXO protein
is loosely bound to the cell wall, though another fraction
may strongly interact with cell wall components.

EXO mediates cell expansion
The exo mutant showed reduced leaf size, root length,
and biomass production. Reduced leaf size in exo is due
to diminished expansion of epidermis and parenchyma
cells. It was shown that EXO gene expression is BRdependent [7] and under control of the BES1 transcription factor [9]. Different experiments were performed to
test the role of EXO in BR-responses. The exo mutant
showed diminished cotyledon and hypocotyl elongation
in response to exogenous BL (Figure 5 and Additional
file 1) indicating that EXO is involved in BR-promoted
cell expansion. It was shown before that EXO overexpression in the BR-deficient dwf1-6 mutant did not
normalize growth [7]. Similarly, introduction of the
35S::EXOga construct did not normalize the phenotype
of the BR-deficient det2 mutant ([25], data not shown).
Thus, EXO is necessary but not sufficient to mediate BRpromoted growth. Expression profiling experiments
demonstrated that EXO controls only a subset of BRregulated, growth-related genes such as KCS1 and EXP5.
BR-deficiency and BR-insensitivity go along with changes
in transcript levels of numerous genes [5]. Since most
BR-regulated genes were normally expressed in the exo
mutant, it appears that EXO does not generally affect BR
sensitivity and BR levels in the shoot. Our expression
profiling experiments revealed further genes with altered
expression levels in exo compared with the wild-type
(Table 4). For example, At5g39320 and WAK1 are

BR growth responses are modified by EXO. Wild-type, exo, and transgenic exo seedlings carrying the 35S::EXOga
construct were grown on half-concentrated MS medium for 7 days in the presence of different concentrations of brassinolide
(BL). The experiment was carried out independently three times, representative examples of observed responses are shown.
50 plants per treatment and genotype were analyzed. Data are mean ± SD. Cotyledon, hypocotyl, and root growth in response
to BL is significantly different in wild-type and exo plants (statistics in Additional file 1). A. Cotyledon length and width

expressed at lower levels in the mutant. At5g39320
encodes an UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase that could be
involved in the synthesis of cell wall precursors. WAK1 is
a transmembrane protein containing a cytoplasmic Ser/
Thr kinase domain and an extracellular domain which
interacts with cell wall pectins [26]. The wall-associated
kinases (WAKs) are likely to be involved in signalling
between the cell wall and the cytoplasm, and could play
a role in development and cell expansion [27].
Thus, EXO is likely to act downstream of the known BRsignalling pathway in the shoot. The protein may
mediate BR-induced growth via modifications of cell

wall properties and metabolism. BR-hypersensitivity of
exo roots suggests that EXO plays a root-specific role in
the control of BR-responses. The molecular basis of this
finding is unknown.
The plant extracellular proteome may comprise 2000
different proteins [21, 28]. The PHI1/EXO proteins do
not show similarities to proteins with known functions,
and thus may have enzymatic or signalling functions
that are unknown to date. Our hypothesis is that EXO
integrates cellular, metabolic, and/or environmental
factors, and feeds this information into an unknown
signalling pathway which controls cell wall properties

Wild-type and exo plants were grown in soil in three independent experiments and gene expression profiling was carried out by means of Affymetrix
ATH1 microarrays. Log2 fold changes (log2 FC) were determined from Col-0/exo signal ratios. A log2 FC ratio of one indicates a FC of two. FDRadjusted P-values were calculated using the approach of Benjamini & Hochberg. Filtering criteria: average log2 FC ≥ 1 or log2 FC ≤ -1 and adjusted
P-value ≤ 0.10.

Wild-type and exo plants were grown in soil. RNA was extracted from
rosette leaves of 10-, 30-, and 50 day-old plants. eIF1a CT values were
subtracted from respective CT values of the gene of interest resulting in
dCT. Subsequently, differences were subtracted from an arbitrary value
(i.e., 40). Higher numbers indicate higher transcript levels. ddCT results
from subtracting (40 – dCT)exo from (40 – dCT)WT. A ddCT of one cycle
indicates a fold change (FC, wild-type vs. exo) of two. Error: SE of gene
of interest in three technical replicates. The experiment was carried out
independently three times, representative examples of observed values
are shown. For sequences of real-time RT-PCR primer pairs see [7].

and metabolic pathways. The BR-hypersensitivity of exo
roots contrasts with the diminished BR-response of exo
shoot organs. Further studies will address the rootspecific phenotype and a potential role of EXO in the
control of BR-responses in roots.

The EXO, EXL1, EXL3, and EXL5 genes showed associated
expression in different plant tissues (Figure 1). The
similar structure of the EXO, EXL1, EXL3, and EXL5
proteins, the associated expression in different organs,
and the common control of expression by BR suggests
that all four proteins may play a role in growth control.
Genetic redundancy of the EXO/EXL genes could account
for the relative mild phenotypic alterations of exo in
comparison to BR-deficient or BR-insensitive plants. The
generation and analysis of mutants in several EXO/EXL
genes may address this issue.

Conclusion
The EXO protein represents a class of proteins that occurs
widely in the plant kingdom. It is localized to the cell
wall and mediates cell expansion. EXO presumably is
involved in signalling processes that coordinate BRresponses with environmental or developmental signals.

Methods
Screen for mutants
The SALK_098602 line [13] carried a T-DNA insertion in
the EXO coding sequence and was named exo. The DNA
insertion site was confirmed by sequencing and is
highlighted in Figure S1 (see Additional file 1). Homozygosity of T-DNA insertions was confirmed by PCR on
genomic DNA using T-DNA border-specific and genespecific primers. Impaired gene expression in the

knock-out mutant was confirmed using RT-PCR (with
primers spanning the respective T-DNA insertion sites)
and northern-blot analyses (Figure 2C and data not
shown).

Establishment of transgenic lines
The 35S::EXO overexpression construct, based on a
modified pGREEN vector, was described before [7]. A
second overexpression construct was established using a
Gateway-compatible vector. The EXO coding sequence
was amplified using the primers EXO_GA_fw 5' CAC
CCC TCT TTC ACT ATT ACA CTT TTC CT 3' and
EXO_GA_rev 5' GAC CAT AGT AGA GCA AGC CGA C 3'.
The PCR fragment was cloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO
(Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) vector, and inserted
into the pH7WG2 vector for expression under control of
the 35S promoter [29]. The resulting construct was
termed 35S::EXOga and used for complementation of
the exo mutant and transformation of the det2 mutant.
The pENTR/D-TOPO vector carrying the EXO coding
sequence was also used to establish the 35S::EXO:GFP
and 35S::EXO:HA fusion constructs using the pK7FWG2
[29] and pGWB14 [30] vectors, respectively. All constructs were transformed into Arabidopsis plants using
the floral-dip method.

Growth conditions
Seeds for growth experiments (i.e., wild-type, exo, and
35S::EXOga in exo) were derived from plants grown in
parallel in a greenhouse under identical conditions.
Plants were grown in one-half concentrated Murashige
and Skoog medium supplemented with 1% sucrose and
solidified with 0.7% agar. After two to three days in a
cold room (4°C), plants were transferred into a growth
chamber with a long day light regime (16 h day,
140 μmol m-2 s-1, 22°C; 8 h night, 22°C) and grown
in a randomized manner. For monitoring root growth,
plants were grown on vertical plates. Alternatively, plants
were established in soil (type 'GS-90 Einheitserde',
Gebrüder Patzer, Germany). Seeds were allowed to
germinate and to grow for two weeks in controlled
growth chambers (7 days: 16 h light [140 μmol m-2 s-1],
20°C, 75% relative humidity; 8 h night, 6°C, 75%
relative humidity; thereafter 7 days: 8 h light [140 μmol
m-2 s-1], 20°C, 60% relative humidity; 16 h night, 16°C,
75% relative humidity). Subsequently, plants were
transferred to long-day conditions in a greenhouse with
artificial light (16 h light [high pressure sodium and
metal halide lamps], 21°C, 50% relative humidity; 8 h
night, 19°C, 50% relative humidity). All genotypes were
grown in the same chamber at the same time in a
randomized manner.

Gene expression analysis and protein extraction
RNA for Northern-blot analysis was isolated using the
Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Northern-blot and real-time
RT-PCR analysis was performed as described [7]. Generation of labelled cRNA and hybridisation of ATH1
oligonucleotide microarrays were performed using standard protocols in cooperation with Atlas biolabs (Berlin,
Germany) as described [7]. Profiles were normalized
with RMA (Table 4), MAS5.0/GCOS (Table S2, see
Additional file 1), or RMA-Express (Figure 1, Additional
file 1: Figure S3, Figure S4, Table S1). Differences
between wild-type and exo were tested with the LIMMA
software package [31] using a moderated paired t-test.
FDR-adjusted P-values were calculated using the
approach of Benjamini & Hochberg.

Protein for Western-blot analysis was isolated using ice
cold extraction buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 7.2), 100 mM
NaCl, 10% glycerol, Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Grenzach, Germany)).

Leaf cross sections and microscopy
The fifth or sixth leaf of 35-day old plants was used for
microscopic analysis. Leaves were embedded in 4% agarose
and sectioned at 40 μm through the widest part of the blade
for transverse sections using a vibratome (Leica VT 1000S,
Bensheim, Germany). Leaf thickness and leaf cell area were
analyzed using the cellP software (Olympus, Hamburg,
Germany). At least eight leaves per genotype and ten cross
sections of each leaf were measured. Cells surrounding the
leaf vein were excluded. Images of sections were generated
using an Olympus BX41 microscope. Subepidermal cell
layers were analyzed using an Olympus AX70 microscope
after bleaching of leaves with 1 M KOH for 24 hours. For
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), leaf samples were fixed
in 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.25% glutaraldehyde in
phosphate buffer (pH 7.1) and dehydrated. A gold/palladium (80:20) coat of 2 nm was applied in a cool sputter coater
SCD 050 (Bal-tec, Balzers, Liechtenstein). Images of the leaf
surface were observed on a LEO 1550 (LEO, Oberkochen,
Germany) microscope. GFP-fluorescence was visualized in
roots of 27-day old transgenic plants grown in sterile media
with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope.

For immunocytochemistry leaves were fixed in 3%
paraformaldehyde and 0.25% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.1). The samples were dehydrated and
infiltrated in Technovit 8100 resin (Heraeus Kulzer,
Wehrheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. The leaves were sectioned at 1.2 μm using a
Leica RM2255 Rotary Microtome and mounted on
charged glass slides. The sections were treated with
0.1 M NH4Cl in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 5
min followed by a washing step in PBS for 5 min. Slides

were incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in
PBS for 30 min and incubated over night at 4°C in
primary antibody (anti-HA, mouse IgG clone 12CA5,
Roche) diluted in 5% BSA/PBS at a ratio of 1:60. Three
washing steps with 0.1% BSA in PBS for 10 min were
followed by one with 1% BSA in PBS for 10 min.
Subsequently, the slides were incubated for 1 hour at RT
with the secondary antibody (FITC goat anti-mouse IgG
(H+L), ZYMED, San Francisco, USA) diluted in 5% BSA/
PBS at a ratio of 1:100. After four washing steps with PBS
for 10 min, images were generated using an Olympus
BX41 microscope.
