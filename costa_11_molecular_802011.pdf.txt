Abstract
Background: Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are important candidates for the development of vaccines because they
are usually able to promote both humoral and cellular immune responses in mammals. We identified and
characterized the hsp60-hsp10 bicistronic operon of the animal pathogen Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, a
Gram-positive bacterium of the class Actinobacteria, which causes caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) in small ruminants.
Findings: To construct the DNA vaccine, the hsp60 gene of C. pseudotuberculosis was cloned in a mammalian
expression vector. BALB/c mice were immunized by intramuscular injection with the recombinant plasmid (pVAX1/
hsp60).
Conclusion: This vaccination induced significant anti-hsp60 IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a isotype production. However,
immunization with this DNA vaccine did not confer protective immunity.

Findings
Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis is a facultative,
intracellular, Gram-positive bacterium of the class Actinobacteria, which also includes the genera Mycobacterium, Nocardia and Rhodococcus. The latter three genera,
together with Corynebacterium, form a group of potentially pathogenic species termed the CMN group. Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis is the etiological agent
of caseous lymphadenitis (CLA), or cheesy gland, which
affects small ruminants (sheep and goats) and occasionally other hosts. This chronic disease is pathognomonically characterized by the formation of suppurative
abscesses in superficial and internal lymph nodes. In

severe cases, these abscesses are also found in internal
organs, such as the lungs, kidneys, liver and spleen,
characterizing visceral CLA [1]. The economic relevance
of CLA, its widespread occurrence, and a lack of knowledge regarding its molecular mechanisms of virulence,
have prompted the investigation of its pathogenesis with
the aim to develop efficient treatment strategies against
this disease [2].
Chemotherapeutic treatment of CLA is difficult
because the bacteria are shielded within granulomas,
where they are relatively protected from antibiotic
drugs [3]. Therefore, attempts to control CLA usually
entail immunoprophylaxis by vaccination. Various strategies have been used for developing vaccines against
CLA, including the use of inactivated or attenuated C.
pseudotuberculosis strains [4,5], fractions of bacterial
cells containing bacterial antigens, antigens from culture supernatants, and DNA vaccines [6]. None of the

currently commercially available vaccines for C. pseudotuberculosis provide effective protection against
CLA [7].
Heat shock proteins (HSPs), or molecular chaperones, are traditionally classified according to their
molecular weight; they are highly conserved proteins,
abundantly expressed in eukaryotic and prokaryotic
organisms [8]. These proteins are expressed in
unstressed cells at low levels, and play an important
role in cell survival both under normal physiological
conditions, during various phases of the cell cycle, cellular differentiation and growth, and under stress conditions, such as heat shock [9]. Heat shock proteins
are considered immunologically important due to the
fact that they are recognized by the host in bacterial,
fungal, and parasitic infections and are therefore capable of inducing strong humoral and cellular immune
responses in mammals [10].
Several studies have shown that these versatile proteins can be used as antigens for the development of
vaccines against diseases. In the case of infectious diseases, HSPs could play a dual role in vaccine development. Pathogen-derived HSPs can be used as vaccine
antigens, and host- and pathogen-derived HSPs can be
used as adjuvants [11,12]. Strategies to more effectively
induce immunity with HSPs include the use of DNA
vaccines. HSP-based DNA vaccines have been effective
in several immunization trials against Mycobacterium
spp. infection [12].
The Hsp60 protein of C. pseudotuberculosis, using a
protein subunit as immunogen against CLA, failed to
confer protection against infection with C. pseudotuberculosis in mice [13]. Using an alternative strategy, we
assessed the feasibility of using DNA encoding hsp60 for
protection against experimental challenge with C.
pseudotuberculosis.

Methods
Bacterial strains, growth conditions and plasmids

All bacterial strains, plasmids and PCR primers used in
this study are listed in Table 1. Escherichia coli TOP10
was grown in Luria-Bertani broth (LB, Difco Laboratories, Detroit, USA) at 37°C with stirring for 18 h. Plasmid-containing transformants were selected by the
addition of ampicillin (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and
X-Gal (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) to the media. The
supplement concentrations were ampicillin (100 μg/mL)
and X-Gal (40 μg/mL).
Isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was used
at a final concentration of 1 mM in complementation
experiments.
Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis biovar ovis strain
T1 was aerobically grown in brain heart infusion broth
(BHI, Acumedia Manufacturers, Inc., Baltimore, MD,
USA) and on 1.5% (w/v) BHI agar plates at 37°C for 4872 h [14].
DNA isolation

All DNA templates were prepared with genomic DNA
isolated by collecting a bacterial cell pellet from culture,
as previously described [14]. Briefly, an aliquot of 20 mL
from a 48 to 72 h culture was centrifuged at 4°C and
2000 × g for 20 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1
mL of Tris/EDTA/RNase [10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.0), 10
mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 50 mg RNaseA
mL-1] and centrifuged again under the same conditions.
Supernatants were discarded and the pellets were resuspended in 1 mL of TE/lysozyme. Samples were then
incubated at 37°C for 30 min; 30 μL of 30% (w/v)
sodium N-lauroylsarcosine (sarcosyl) were added, and
the mixture was incubated for 20 min at 65°C, followed
by incubation for 5 min at 4°C. DNA was purified using
phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and precipitated

spectrophotometrically.
PCR amplification and cloning

PCR reagents, restriction endonucleases, and ligation
reagents used in this study were all purchased from
Invitrogen, San Diego, CA. Both genes were amplified
by PCR using genomic DNA of C. pseudotuberculosis as
a template, with primers that were designed based on
the DNA sequence of paralogs of C. diphtheriae NCTC
13129 (NCBI Acc. GeneID: 2648771 and NCBI Acc.
GeneID: 2648772). The C. pseudotuberculosis hsp60
gene was amplified by PCR using the following primers:
5’- GATGGCAAAGCTGATTGCA -3’ (sense orientation) and 5’- TTAGTGGTGGTGATGGTG -3’ (antisense orientation). The PCR assays were carried out in a
final reaction volume of 50 μL, containing 20 ng genomic DNA, 2 μM of each of the primers, 1 × PCR Buffer
II and 1 U AccuPrime taq DNA polymerase. Amplification was run in a thermal cycler (PTC-100, MJ
Research, Inc.) as follows: one cycle of 95°C for 5 min;
29 cycles of 95°C for 1 min, 50°C for 40 s, and 68°C for
2 min 30 s; and a final extension step at 68°C for 7 min.
The hsp60 fragment was purified from bands in 1.0%
(w/v) agarose gels using the Consert TM Rapid Gel
Extraction System kit (Gibco-BRL, Gaithersburg, MD,
USA). The retrieved DNA fragment was then ligated
into the pCR ® 2.1-TOPO ® vector, as described in the
manufacturer’s protocol. The recombinant plasmid
(pCR ® 2.1-TOPO ® /hsp60) was then introduced into
competent E. coli TOP10 cells, and single recombinant
colonies were selected. Plasmid DNA was isolated from
cells by the alkaline lysis method [15]. The presence of
the inserted DNA fragment was confirmed by sequencing, using the DYEnamic ET Dye Terminator kit
(Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA).
To verify operon structure, the hsp10 gene and intergenic regions of the operon were amplified using the
following primer pair: 5’- GTGGCTAACGTCAATATCAAGCC -3’ (sense orientation) (designed based on the
DNA sequence of paralogs of C. diphtheria NCTC
13129) and 5’- CTTCAGGATGCCTTCACGGG -3’
(antisense orientation) (designed based on the DNA
sequence of the C. pseudotuberculosis hsp60 gene). The
PCR assays were carried out in a final reaction volume
of 50 μL containing 20 ng genomic DNA, 2 μM of each
of the primers, 1 × PCR Buffer II and 1 U AccuPrime
taq DNA polymerase. Amplification was performed with
a thermal cycler (PTC-100, MJ Research, Inc.) as follows: one cycle of 95°C for 3 min; 29 cycles of 95°C for
1 min, 50°C for 40 s, and 72°C for 1 min 30 s; and a
final extension step at 72°C for 5 min. The amplicon
containing hsp10 was also purified, cloned, transformed,
and sequenced as described above.

Bioinformatics and comparative genomics

Sequence homology analysis was carried out against
nucleotide and protein databases available in GenBank
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, using the Blast tool
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/ [16]. Multiple
sequence alignments and analysis were performed using
the ClustalW algorithm http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/.
The predicted amino acid sequences were analyzed to
identify conserved motifs, using the Conserved Domains
program http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/
wrpsb.cgi and the ExPaSy ScanProsite program http://
www.expasy.org/tools/scanprosite/. For three-dimensional modeling, we employed MODELLER http://salilab.org/modeller/modeller.html [17]. The isoelectric
point (Ip) and molecular weight (Mw) were predicted
with software found on the ExPaSy website http://web.
expasy.org/compute_pi/ [18].
Functional characterization of the C. pseudotuberculosis
hsp60 gene

To examine the functional activity of the C. pseudotuberculosis hsp60 gene, E. coli B178groEL44 mutant
(ΔgroEL44) was transformed with a pProEx-Hta/hsp60
plasmid constructed by Pinho et al [13]. The E. coli
ΔgroEL44 mutant is a strain that bears a temperaturesensitive allele of groEL, namely groEL44. This mutant
strain is unable to propagate bacteriophages g, T4 or T5
[19]. Two phenotypes were analyzed in this complementation assay: heat stress resistance and inability of gcIb2
phage to grow without the protein coded by the hsp60
(groEL) gene, as described by Kumar et al [20], with
adaptations for use in our study. First, the empty vector
(pProEx-Hta) and the recombinant vector (pProEx-Hta/
hsp60) were transformed into the E. coli wild-type B178
and ΔgroEL44 strains. To investigate the effect of temperature on protein expression, the bacteria were grown
in LB broth containing ampicillin and IPTG. The protein was visualized in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel [21].
Aliquots of 3 μL of the induced cultures were plated on
LB, with and without IPTG, in dilutions from 10-1 to
10 -6 , and the plates were incubated at 30 and 42°C.
Finally, to assess the growth of the gcIb2 phage, E. coli
ΔgroEL44 was transformed with the empty and recombinant vectors (groEL44[pProEX-Hta] and groEL44
[pProEx-Hta/hsp60]), while the wild-type E. coli was
transformed with the empty vector (B178[pProEX-Hta]).
Dilutions of the phage (10 -1, 10-2, 10-3 and 10-4) were
made. Aliquots of the dilutions were plated on LB containing these transformants, with and without IPTG,
and the plates were incubated at 30°C for 18 h.
Plasmid construction for the DNA vaccine

The hsp60 gene was amplified using primers containing
restriction sites and the Kozak consensus sequence

within the primer: 5’- AAGCTTACCATGGCAAAGATTGCATT - 3’ (sense orientation) and 5’GGATCCTTAGTGGTGGTGATGGTG - 3’ (antisense
orientation), which include the HindIII and BamHI sites
(underlined), respectively. The hsp60 gene was amplified, cloned and transformed as described above. The
recombinant plasmid (pCR®2.1-TOPO®/hsp60) and the
eukaryotic expression vector (pVAX1©) were submitted
to HindIII/BamHI double digestion. The digested samples were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.
DNA fragments were purified as described above. The
purified DNA fragments were then subcloned into the
pVAX1 vector. The components and conditions of the
ligation reaction were according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The presence and the correct size of the
insert were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion
(EcoRI/HindIII). Both the empty vector (control) and
the recombinant vector (pVAX1/hsp60) were introduced
into competent E. coli TOP10, and single recombinants
were selected. Control and pVAX1/hsp60 vectors were
isolated and purified using the EndoFree Plasmid Giga
kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). DNA concentration
and purity were determined by absorbance at 260 and
280 nm.
Immunization and challenge

BALB/c mice (6-8 weeks old) were divided into two
groups of five mice each. Mice were pretreated with 10
μM cardiotoxin five days before the first DNA immunization, as previously described [22]. Each animal was
immunized by injecting the quadriceps muscle with four
doses of 100 μg at 15-day intervals, with an empty vector (pVAX1; control) or a recombinant vector pVAX1/
hsp60. Blood samples from the mice were collected by
retro-orbital plexus puncture 15, 30, 45 and 60 days
after the first immunization. All mice were challenged
intraperitoneally 21 days after the fourth vaccination
with an infectious dose of 1 ± 106 CFU of the MIC-6
strain of C. pseudotuberculosis. After challenge, the mice
were monitored daily and the protective effect of the
DNA vaccine was assessed by evaluation of the survival
rate of the immunized animals. This experiment was
performed twice to confirm the results.
Determination of antibody levels

To examine the humoral responses induced by pVAX1/
hsp60, the levels of specific anti-hsp60 IgG, IgG1 and
IgG2a isotypes in individual mouse sera were determined by ELISA. Flat-bottomed 96-well plates were
coated with the C. pseudotuberculosis Hsp60 protein in
0.05 M carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, (5 μg/mL
per well) at 4°C for 18 h. The plates were washed three
times with PBS-0.05% T20 (1X PBS, pH 7.4, 0.05%
Tween 20) and then blocked with PBS-0.05% T20

containing 10% bovine serum albumin - BSA (250 μL
per well) at room temperature for 2 h. Plates were then
washed three times with PBS-0.05% T20 before addition
of a 1 in 100 serum dilution (100 μL per well) from
immunized mice. The plates were then incubated at
room temperature for 1 h, and subsequently washed
three times with PBS-0.05% T20. Afterwards, 100 μL of
peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1 in 5000), IgG1
(1 in 5000) and IgG2a (1 in 2000) antibodies were
added per well (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham,
AL), and the plates were incubated for 1 h. The reaction
was developed by adding 200 pmol orthophenyldiamine
(Sigma-Aldrich, Bornem, Belgium) for 15 min and
stopped by the addition of 50 μL of 6% H2SO4 to each
well. The plates were read at 492 nm with an automatic
microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
Statistical analysis

All data were expressed as means ± standard deviation
(S.D.) and analyzed using GraphPad Prism, version 4.03,
for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Statistical differences between groups were identified using
one-way ANOVA. A one-tailed Student’s t-test was
used to determine if there were significant differences
between the experimental and control groups. A P value
of 0.05 or less was considered significant.

Results
Isolation and characterization of the C. pseudotuberculosis
hsp60 and hsp10 genes

The C. pseudotuberculosis hsp60 gene was amplified by
PCR using primers that were designed based on the
genome of C. diphtheriae, because of the phylogenetic
proximity between these two species. The full lengths of
the DNA sequences that were amplified were 1,626
(hsp60) and 297 (hsp10) nucleotides. The nucleotide
sequences of the C. pseudotuberculosis strain T1 60 kDa
chaperonin and 10 kDa chaperonin GroES coding
sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession
numbers AY781285 and DQ869271, respectively. These
two genes are separated by a small sequence of 11 bp
(Figure 1). In order to obtain information on similarity
with genes of other species, the corresponding
sequences were subjected to BlastN. Similarity searches
of nucleotide sequences of both genes revealed significant identity with other Corynebacterium species. The
hsp60 gene was predicted to encode a putative protein
consisting of 541 amino acid residues, with a predicted
molecular weight (MW) of 57.4 kDa and a theoretical
isoelectric point (Ip) of 4.91. The hsp10 gene was predicted to encode a polypeptide of 98 amino acids, with a
MW of 10.6 kDa and an Ip of 4.49. In order to search
for the putative identities and functions of these genes,
the sequences were subjected to BlastX searches against

the protein database of GenBank. The putative Hsp60
protein displayed greater similarity to the Hsp60 protein
of C. diphtheriae (89%) and C. glutamicum (82%), when
compared to those of Nocardia (66.9%) and Mycobacterium (61%). The comparative alignment of primary
amino acid sequences of Hsp60 homologues can be
observed in Figure 2. The Hsp60 putative protein shows
a motif characterized by a histidine-rich C-terminal. In
order to compare the structure of Hsp60 protein of C.
pseudotuberculosis with that of other chaperonins, a
three-dimensional (3D) model was predicted based on
PDB-related structures (Figure 3). The protein was
found to have high sequence similarity (54% identity)
with chaperonins of other bacteria.
Functional characterization of hsp60

The GroEL mechanism is universally conserved in prokaryotic species; consequently, paralogous copies of
GroEL may result in redundancy of chaperonin function
in these organisms. In E. coli, the development of phage
lambda (g) requires a functional GroEL/S system. GroEL
was originally identified as the host factor responsible
for phage g capsid protein assembly and was subsequently shown to be essential for cell viability [20]. We
used a complementation test to functionally characterize
the hsp60 gene (groEL gene) of C. pseudotuberculosis
(Figure 4). Two E. coli strains were used for this purpose: the wild-type B178 strain and a ΔgroEL44 mutant.
We observed that the mutant transformed with the
pProEx-Hta/hsp60 vector only grew at the 10-1 dilution,

when incubated at 30°C. When incubation was at 42°C,
bacterial growth was not observed (Figure 4b). The
ΔgroEL44 mutant, incubated at 30°C, was also not phenotypically restored in a phage experiment. The expression of C. pseudotuberculosis hsp60 (groEL) did not
promote phage development (Figure 4c).
Anti-Hsp60 antibody response and protective efficacy of
the DNA vaccine in a murine model

Vaccination with plasmid DNA encoding hsp60 induced
significant levels of anti-Hsp60 IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a
antibodies in BALB/c mice, after the second immunization, compared to levels in mice vaccinated with the
empty vector (Figure 5). Increased antibody responses
following boosting were observed for all the isotypes.
The levels of IgG1 and IgG2a at 15, 30, 45 and 60 days
after the first immunization and the IgG1/IgG2a ratio
were recorded (Table 2). The results suggest a Th2-type
immune response, induced by pVAX1/hsp60 vaccination, at 15 days after the first immunization, with a
decrease of the IgG1/IgG2a ratio at 30, 45 and 60 days
after the first immunization.
Protection studies

DNA vaccine protection studies were carried out in
mice to test the potential of hsp60 for this purpose. All
the animals died 12 days after challenge with the wildtype C. pseudotuberculosis MIC-6 strain. The mice
began to display clinical signs of morbidity three days
after infection; during the first two weeks the animals

and ascitis, all characteristic signs and symptoms of a C.
pseudotuberculosis infection.

Discussion
This study was the first to characterize the immunogenic potential of the hsp60 DNA vaccine for protection
against the veterinary pathogen C. pseudotuberculosis.
The hsp60 DNA vaccine induced a cellular immune
response but failed to confer protective immunity to the
host, which corroborates a previous study that found
that an Hsp60 protein subunit vaccine also did not confer protection [13].

Characterization of the hsp60-hsp10 bicistronic operon

We found that in C. pseudotuberculosis these genes are
arranged in a bicistronic hsp60-hsp10 operon, separated
by a small sequence of 11 bp. The size and organization
of the hsp60 gene in C. pseudotuberculosis (1,626 bp)
was similar to those described for other bacterial species, such as C. glutamicum (1,617 bp) [23] and R. equi
(1,623 bp) [24]. The hsp10 gene (297 bp) has a start
codon (GTG), and the predicted molecular weight is
10.6 kDa. These characteristics are conserved in the
hsp10 genes of other species [25]. Comparative DNA
sequence analysis of the hsp10 and hsp60 genes showed
significant similarity with genes of microorganisms with

phylogenetic proximity, especially between two hsp60
paralogs (groEL1 and groEL2) within the Corynebacterium genus [26]. Alignment of amino acid sequences
coded by hsp60 revealed a higher identity at the N- and
C- terminal regions. According to Barreiro et al [26]

some microorganisms have different functional motifs at
the C-terminal ends of the proteins coded by hsp60;
there is a string of histidines in groEL1, while groEL2
has a glycine-glycine-methionine (GGM) motif. This
putative protein showed a motif containing eight

histidine residues at the C terminus, which is characteristic of hsp60 paralog groEL1 protein in actinomycetes
[27]. The predicted tertiary structure of the Hsp60 protein showed three functionally distinct domains that are
very characteristic of chaperonins: an a-helical

equatorial, a small intermediate, and a highly flexible
apical domain [28].
The high level of similarity between hsp60 of C. pseudotuberculosis and those of other important pathogens,
such as M. leprae and M. tuberculosis, is important

Significantly different compared to mice immunized with the pVAX1 vector.

because other studies have indicated that mycobacterial
Hsp60 is a potential immunodominant target of the
humoral and T-cell response in mice and humans [29].
Additionally, high sequence homology of HSPs between
different species results in HSPs that have cross-reactive
epitopes [30].
Despite high homology between C. pseudotuberculosis
hsp60 and E. coli GroEL, our complementation assay
failed to complement the GroEL defect in E. coli. There
are several explanations for these results. First, the
hsp60 expressed in E. coli may have improperly folded
and thus lacked activity to complement GroEL. Second,
since HSPs have been reported to adversely affect protein homeostasis and vital intracellular functions [11],
overexpression of hsp60 may have reduced cell viability
at all concentrations except at the 10-1 dilution at 30°C.
Third, protein-protein interaction between E. coli GroEL
and GroES (the corresponding hsp60 and hsp10 paralogs) is also necessary for cell viability [31]. The GroEL
mutant E. coli complemented with the C. pseudotuberculosis hsp60 gene did not grow, indicating that there
may be little protein-protein interaction between the
Hsp60 and E. coli groES proteins. Finally, lack of growth
may indicate that the Hsp60 protein cannot function
inside E. coli despite protein homology because speciesspecificity of chaperone proteins is complex and is not
explained simply by protein homology [32], because the
regulatory mechanism of the heat shock response differs
among species [33].
E. coli GroEL is also required for the proper growth of
bacteriophages, including capsid formation [27,34]. The
inability of the C. pseudotuberculosis hsp60 gene to support the growth of g phage in the E. coli GroEL mutant
suggests that the Hsp60 protein does not perform the
specific function of capsid formation inside E. coli, again
possibly due to incorrect folding.
Immune response to hsp60 DNA vaccine in mice

Due to the success of DNA-based vaccines using genes
encoding HSPs to induce immunity against a variety of
pathogens [24], we chose the C. pseudotuberculosis hsp60
gene for the development of a DNA vaccine. Vaccination

with the recombinant C. pseudotuberculosis hsp60 antigen
induced significant production of specific anti-Hsp60 antibodies. These data indicate that the DNA vaccine
(pVAX1/hsp60) generated both IgG1 and IgG2a
responses, when administered to BALB/c mice, however,
with a tendency towards a Th1-type immune response
after 30 days of the first immunization based on reduced
IgG1/IgG2a ratio. Nevertheless, DNA immunization with
pVAX1/hsp60 conferred no protection against challenge
with the pathogen; it did not prevent infection.
The protective efficacy of DNA vaccines has been studied
extensively for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. For example, a
DNA vaccine encoding the M. leprae hsp65 induced protective immunity against tuberculosis challenge in a mouse
model [35], and a DNA vaccine with the M. avium hsp65
plasmid elicited a strong protective immune response in
lambs and protected against M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis infection [36]. However, other studies have
shown that a high antibody response induced by DNA vaccines does not always result in protective immunity [24], as
we also observed in our study.
In summary, intramuscular administration of hsp60
DNA vaccine in mice induced an immune response but
failed to confer protection against infection with C.
pseudotuberculosis.
