Abstract
Background: The complete genome sequences for human and the nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans offer an opportunity to learn more about human gene function through functional
characterization of orthologs in the worm. Based on a previous genome-wide analysis of wormhuman orthologous transmembrane proteins, we selected seventeen genes to explore
experimentally in C. elegans. These genes were selected on the basis that they all have high
confidence candidate human orthologs and that their function is unknown. We first analyzed their
phylogeny, membrane topology and domain organization. Then gene functions were studied
experimentally in the worm by using RNA interference and transcriptional gfp reporter gene
fusions.
Results: The experiments gave functional insights for twelve of the genes studied. For example,
C36B1.12, the worm ortholog of three presenilin-like genes, was almost exclusively expressed in
head neurons, suggesting an ancient conserved role important to neuronal function. We propose
a new transmembrane topology for the presenilin-like protein family. sft-4, the worm ortholog of
surfeit locus gene Surf-4, proved to be an essential gene required for development during the larval
stages of the worm. R155.1, whose human ortholog is entirely uncharacterized, was implicated in
body size control and other developmental processes.
Conclusions: By combining bioinformatics and C. elegans experiments on orthologs, we provide
functional insights on twelve previously uncharacterized human genes.

Background
The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been used as a
simple model for understanding animal biology for
nearly four decades. After the sequencing of entire
genomes from several metazoans, we are now in an excellent position to take a gene-centric approach to the worm

as a model organism. A majority of human genes have
homologs in C. elegans. In a comparative proteomics
study, 83% of the worm proteome was found to have
human homologous genes [1]. Only 11% or less contains
nematode specific genes. This makes the worm a suitable

model organism for delineating human gene function [24].
In a previous study, all transmembrane protein families in
the C. elegans genome were classified and the human
orthologs identified [5]. Predicted proteins with two or
more membrane domains were clustered and for each
cluster a multiple alignment was created. From the alignments, HMMs (Hidden Markov Models) were built and
subsequently used to search for mammalian homologs.
The consensus of nine different phylogenetic methods
and BLAST were used to assign orthology. This resulted in
a total of 174 worm-human orthology assignments with a
high confidence.
Orthologs are sequences that arose from a common
ancestor gene and were separated by a speciation event
[6]. Identification of orthologs is important, since they
might share functionality. In closely related species, such
as human and mouse, orthologs are normally trivial to
find. However, when comparing distantly related species,
e.g. human and worm, this is no longer the case because
the similarity levels overall are low. Instead, one needs to
rely on sophisticated phylogenetic reconstruction techniques to infer whether two genes stem from a node that
corresponds to a speciation split or to a duplication event
within a lineage. Close orthologs are likely to have the
same biological role in the two organisms. Distant
orthologs on the other hand, are less likely to have the
same phenotypical role, but may have the same role in the
corresponding pathway. Consequently, by studying true
C. elegans orthologs to human genes experimentally in the
worm, one can potentially learn more about the gene
function also in humans. Depending on whether duplication(s) have occurred in one or both lineages since the
speciation event, orthologs can form one-to-one, one-tomany or many-to-many relationships.
Paralogs arise from a duplication event. A common scenario when genes are duplicated is that one of the gene
copies is under negative selective pressure and therefore
retains the function of the ancestor. The other copy might
then be more free to evolve a new function different from
the ancestral function. This is the reason why paralogs in
different species are less likely to share functionality compared to orthologs. Paralogs can be divided into two subtypes – outparalogs and inparalogs [7]. Outparalogs are
paralogs that evolved by gene duplications that happened
before the speciation event and therefore they do not form
orthologous relationships. Inparalogs, on the other hand,
form co-orthologous relationships, since they are paralogs
that evolved by gene duplications that happened after the
speciation event.

Here we present an initial functional characterization in
C. elegans of seventeen genes. The criteria for selecting
these genes were that they are high confidence candidate
orthologs to human genes [5] and that their function is
unknown. They are all predicted to encode transmembrane proteins, which imply that they could constitute as
yet unknown receptors, channels or transporters playing
important roles in various biological processes in multicellular organisms. We are particularly interested in studying those genes that might have a neuronal function. The
phylogeny, membrane topology and domain organization were analyzed. Gene function was explored experimentally in the worm by means of RNA interference
induced knock-down phenotypes and gene expression
patterns.

Results
Membrane topology predictions
The consensus of nine different methods was used to predict membrane topologies for the putative C. elegans proteins, and two different methods were used to predict
signal peptides (see Methods for details). Each predicting
method has some margin of error; therefore the consensus
from several different predictors is more likely to give a
better estimate of the true topology. Results were viewed
using the SFINX tool [8,9], an example of output can be
seen in Fig. 1. The number of transmembrane (TM)
regions ranges between six and ten (except for one of the
splice variants of R155.1), with a majority of proteins having six or seven TM regions (see Table 1). Such proteins
are likely to be receptors, channels, or transporters. One
case, however, (C36B1.12) is likely to be an intramembrane protease.
Phylogenetic analysis
The results from the phylogenetic analysis are presented
in Table 1. The previous orthology assignments are still
valid [5], although for some C. elegans genes, additional
human orthologs have emerged from the sequencing
efforts. At present, 29% (5 of 17) of the worm genes have
one-to-many ortholog relationship with human genes,
which means that there has probably been an expansion
in the human lineage. This is the case for C36B1.12
(Q93346) and ZK721.1 (Q9GYF0) (see Fig. 2A and 2D,
respectively). 53% (9 of 17) showed a one-to-one relationship with its human ortholog, for example sft-4
(Q18864) (see Fig. 2C). Two of the worm genes, F40F9.1
(Q8MQ55, Q8MQ56) and F40F9.2 (Q20241), seem to
have a many-to-many relationship (see Fig. 2B). The phylogenetic tree in Fig. 2B show somewhat inconclusive support for where the speciation event could have taken
place. It is possible that the human gene Q8IVW7 is also
an ortholog to the two worm genes. To investigate the
ortholog relationship further, Orthostrapper was used
[10]. Orthostrapper analyzes a set of bootstrap trees

Figure 1
Output from SFINX for (A) C. elegans protein C36B1.12 and (B) one of its assigned human orthologs Q8TCT8. The overall
membrane topology of the two proteins is very similar. The consensus from the different topology predictors is nine transmembrane (TM) regions, a N-terminal signal peptide, and a >150 amino acids non-cytoplasmic N-terminal region. Conserved
aspartic acid residues are marked with an asterisk (residues 433 and 516 for C36B1.12; residues 351 and 412 for Q8TCT8).
Phobius is the only program used that predicts both TM regions and N-terminal signal peptides. The other programs are
designed to only detect TM regions, and therefore, they commonly mistake the signal peptide for a TM region. Numbers on
the horizontal axis indicate amino acid positions. Color coding: black = TM region, white = non-cytoplasmic, gray = cytoplasmic, striped = N-terminal signal peptide predicted by Phobius.

instead of the optimal tree for orthologs. The algorithm
detects orthologous relations between two (groups of)
species. The frequency of orthology assignments in the
bootstrap trees can be interpreted as a confidence value
for the possible orthology of two proteins. Orthology
assignments in the optimal phylogenetic tree that might
be incorrect can be identified by their low ortholog bootstrap value. This makes it possible to resolve complicated
many-to-many orthologous relationships. When analyzing the multiple alignment for the phylogenetic tree in

Fig. 2B using Orthostrapper, the results showed a stronger
support for the human genes Q9BWQ8 and Q969X1 to be
the orthologs compared to Q8IVW7 (65% vs. 23%). It
seems that the orthologous relationship in this particular
case is complicated to elucidate. Still, Q9BWQ8 and
Q969X1 are the best candidate human orthologs for the
C. elegans genes F40F9.1 and F40F9.2.
H13N06.5 and T28F3.3 both show sequence similarity to
the human gene Q92504. However, the phylogenetic tree

methods, the bootstrap support improved to 99% and
67%, respectively. When analyzing the phylogenetic tree
using Orthostrappper, there was a very strong support for
this orthology assignment (94%). Therefore, we conclude
that T04A8.12 is probably the ortholog to Q9UHJ9.

C-terminal half of the protein and in the N-terminus there
is substantial variation. This suggests that the C-terminal
part may constitute the proteolytic subdomain, whereas
the N-terminus defines the specific function of the respective proteins.

C30H6.2 has three potential human orthologs, Q9H6T8,
Q9NXC4 and Q96NN4. The bootstrap support for the
speciation node with PAM distances was 57%. This
improved to 87% and 88% with observed divergence and
Poisson correction, respectively. Orthostrapper results
showed a strong support for Q9H6T8 and Q9NXC4 as
orthologs to C30H6.2 (84%), whereas the support for
Q96NN4 was weaker (57%). Considering these results,
we believe that all three human genes are orthologs to the
worm gene; however, the ortholog relationship seems to
be weaker between Q96NN4 and C30H6.2.

F40F9.1 and F40F9.2 seem to have a PF01027 domain
(UPF0005), which is an uncharacterized protein family.
Both F08F1.7 and ZK858.6 may belong to the PF02990
domain family (EMP70). Proteins in this family might be
located to endosomal membranes [16]. F14F3.3 and
R155.1 were predicted to have a PF03062 domain, which
is annotated as a MBOAT (Membrane bound O-acyl transferases) domain. Biochemically characterized proteins of
this group encode enzymes that transfer organic acids
onto hydroxyl groups of membrane-embedded targets
[17]. SFT-4 most likely has a PF02077 (SURF4) domain.
Members of this family are believed to encode integral
membrane proteins located to the endoplasmic reticulum
[18]. A PF03798 domain (LAG1) was found in Y6B3B.10.
This domain is associated with longevity in yeast (Jiang et
al. 1998). Three of the seventeen putative proteins
(D2013.10, T04A8.12 and ZK721.1) do not match to any
Pfam-A domain.

Putative domain assignments
The domain organization of the predicted proteins was
analyzed using the Pfam database [11,12] (see Table 1).
Conclusions about possible functions cannot be drawn
from the mere presence of a putative domain, although it
can give some indication.

Five of the proteins (C30H6.2, T11F9.2, H13N06.5,
T28F3.3 and T01D3.5) may have a PF02535 domain,
which is annotated as being a ZIP domain. The ZIP family
is believed to include zinc and other metal transporters.
The ZIP proteins have been classified into four groups
based on sequence conservation [13]; the ZIP subfamily I
and II, the gufA subfamily and the LIV-1 subfamily (also
called the LZT subfamily). The ZIP I subfamily contains
mostly plant and yeast sequences; however, it also
includes T01D3.5 and its putative orthologs in Drosophila
melanogaster, mouse and human (Q9V4C6, Q8BFU1 and
Q9NUM3, respectively). The other four worm genes
appear to belong to the LIV-1 subfamily. This subfamily
has a unique metalloprotease motif that raises the possibility that they might have protease activity [14]. Within
the LIV-1 subfamily there is a subgroup called the KE4
group, to which H13N06.5 and its human ortholog hKE4
(Q92504) belong.
C36B1.12 was predicted to have a PF04258 domain, a
probable signal peptide peptidase (SPP) domain. SPP catalyzes intramembrane proteolysis of some signal peptides
after they have been cleaved from a preprotein. This
processing by SPP is related to protein cleavage by presenilins. Homologs to SPP are divided into five subfamilies
based on phylogenetic analysis (subfamily SPP and
subfamilies SPPL1-4, for SPP like) [15]. C36B1.12 and its
putative human orthologs Q8TCT7, Q8TCT8 and
Q8IUH8 belong to the SPPL2 subfamily. The members of
subfamilies SPPL1-4 only show homology to SPP in the

RNA interference studies
Out of the seventeen genes studied, sft-4 and R155.1
exhibited phenotypes when both the N2 (wildtype) and
the RNAi sensitive rrf-3(pk1426) II [19,20] strains were
subjected to RNAi by feeding (see Table 2). The phenotypes were enhanced with strain rrf-3, although the Dpy
(dumpy) phenotype seen for R155.1 was still low penetrant and relatively weak. The Lva (larval arrest) observed
for sft-4 occurred at larval stages L2–L3 and there was an
almost complete penetrance with the sensitive strain. The
RNAi phenotypes for both genes were detected at all temperatures, although, for sft-4 they were more severe at
higher temperatures. The positive results were verified
with RNAi by injection in strain N2.
Analysis of gene expression
Transcriptional fusions with gfp were established for fourteen genes and the resulting gene expression was analyzed. The results are presented in Table 2. Because the
arrays are extrachromosomal and not integrated; mosaic
patterns of expression were observed. Also, germ line
expression could not be analyzed, due to germ line silencing. For 18% (3 of 17) of the genes no transgenic lines
could be established despite several attempts, and out of
the lines established, 14% (2 of 14) showed no expression. This could be due to several reasons (see
Discussion). In half of the transgenic lines established,
expression was found in more than three different tissues.
The most prevalent major tissues of expression were hypo-

rectal epithelial cells (re), spermatheca (s), vulva (v), ventral nerve cord (vnc). A limitation when extrachromosomal array transgenes
are used is that expression in the germ line is not possible to evaluate. No transgenic lines could be generated for T11F9.2, H13N06.5
and T04A8.12. Possible reasons for this could be that the injected DNA concentration was too low or that the sequence was toxic. In
either case, the extrachromosomal array formed may not have been sufficiently large to be inheritable [46]. The transgenic lines for
ZK858.6 and F14F3.3 showed no expression of gfp. This might be caused by conditional gene expression, germline silencing or absence
of the promoter::gfp fusion from the inheritable extrachromosomal array [46].

dermis (9 of 14 transgenic lines), nervous system and pharyngeal muscle (8 of 14) and intestine (6 of 14).
Examples of gene expression patterns observed are presented in Fig. 3, 4, 5, 6. C36B1.12 shows expression
restricted to head neurons and intestine (see Fig. 3). The
intestinal expression was stronger during larval stages
compared to the adult stage, and it was predominantly
located to posterior intestinal nuclei. F40F9.1 and
F40F9.2 demonstrate some overlapping expression in
nervous system and pharyngeal muscle (see Fig. 4A,4G);
however, F40F9.1 appear to be more widely expressed in
the nervous system with expression in more neuronal cell
bodies and in commissures and ventral nerve cord (see
Fig. 4C). Expression of F40F9.1 is also located to body
wall muscle and hypodermal cells in the tail (see Fig. 4E).
F40F9.2 is also expressed in the excretory system,
although it is weaker compared to the other tissues (see
Fig. 4G). Widespread expression patterns were observed
for sft-4 and ZK721.1 both during larval and adult stages
(see Fig. 5 and 6, respectively). For sft-4 it was highly
mosaic with pharyngeal muscle as the most consistent tissue of expression.

Putative function assignments
C36B1.12
The three putative human orthologs (Q8TCT7, Q8TCT8
and Q8IUH8) to the C. elegans gene C36B1.12 are
thought to be presenilin-like (PSL) proteins (also called
PSH proteins for presenilin homologs). Presenilins are an
important group of proteases acting in the nervous system. Abnormal proteolytic cleavage may result in accumulation of pathogenic insoluble proteins, implied in e.g.
Alzheimer's disease. We have shown that C36B1.12 is
probably expressed in head neurons and intestine; however, the intestinal expression might be ectopic (see Discussion for details), which would imply that the gene is
exclusively expressed in neurons. This suggests that the
three human orthologs may also encode neuronal
functions.

The membrane topology of human proteins belonging to
the presenilin-like family has been analyzed previously.
Q8IUH8 was predicted to have seven transmembrane
(TM) segments and a cytoplasmic C-terminus [21], and
the same was predicted for HM13_HUMAN (Swissprot:
Q8TCT9) [15]. However, it should be noted that although
the number of TM segments of these predictions is the
same, the topologies are in fact different. The fourth segment in the Q8IUH8 prediction is missing from the

HM13_HUMAN prediction, and the C-terminal segment
in the HM13_HUMAN prediction is missing from the
Q8IUH8 prediction. This means that the four C-terminal
TM segments are not in register between the predictions,
and consequently the loops are on opposite sides. This
includes the loop between the putatively catalytic aspartic
acid residues also present in presenilins that was predicted
cytoplasmic by Ponting et al., and non-cytoplasmic by
Weihofen et al. Because of the TM segment disagreement,
these aspartic acid residues were predicted to be located in
TM5 and TM6 in the Ponting et al. prediction, but in TM4
and TM5 in the Weihofen et al. prediction.

Merging these two proposed topologies by accepting all
TM segments predicted by one or the other study would
yield a topology with nine TM segments. Our own analysis of the proteins in question using the SFINX tool [8,9]
provides strong support for this topology, with the C-terminus in the cytoplasm (data not shown). We therefore
propose that both previous TM topologies had incorrectly
left out one TM segment, which would correspond to segments 4 and 9 in the 9-TM segment model.
We further analyzed the other members of this family
with SFINX [8,9], and consistently found a 9-TM topology

model with C-terminus in the cytoplasm. The conserved
aspartic acid residues would be located in TM6 and TM7.
As an example, the SFINX output for C36B1.12 and one of
its human orthologs Q8TCT8 is shown in Fig. 1. The overall topology is very similar between the putative worm
protein and all of its orthologs in both human and mouse,
as well as the other presenilin-like proteins. One
difference, however, is that C36B1.12 and two of its
human (Q8TCT8 and Q8IUH8) and mouse orthologs
(Q9JJF9 and Q8BHP0) are predicted to have a N-terminal
signal peptide, a feature that seems to be missing from the
other presenilin-like proteins.
F40F9.1 and F40F9.2
F40F9.1 and F40F9.2 are 48% identical to each other on
the protein sequence level and they also appear to have
similar membrane topologies. They are close in the
genome (<100 bp apart), but on opposite strands. It has
been shown that genes closer than 500 bp on opposite
strands are likely to have a shared control region [22],
which means that these two genes might be coexpressed.
The expression patterns observed are indeed overlapping,
although not to a full extent (see Table 2). One of the
human orthologs (Q9BWQ8) identified has been shown
to protect cells from Fas-mediated cell death [23], suggesting that F40F9.1 and F40F9.2 might be involved in
apoptosis.
sft-4
The sft-4 gene (C54H2.5) is highly conserved throughout
evolution with orthologs in both vertebrates and non-vertebrates. All orthologous relationships are one-to-one
with a high bootstrap support. The tree in Fig. 2C indicates that there exists a worm homolog (O45731) to sft-4.
O45731 (T02E1.7) was found to be 33% identical to sft-4
on the protein sequence level and it was also predicted to
have a PF02077 (SURF4) domain. However, our RNAi
screen indicates that there is no or little functional redundancy between the two genes, since sft-4 has a very strong
RNAi phenotype, showing an almost complete larval
arrest at stages L2–L3. The RNAi phenotype for T02E1.7 is
wildtype according to previous studies [24]. Our gene
expression analysis revealed a wide spread expression of
the reporter construct for sft-4 (see Table 2). Taken
together, these data suggests that sft-4 may play an essential role during development acting in many tissues.
ZK721.1
ZK721.1 is most probably orthologous to the human
genes Q9NXL6 and Q9Y357 (CGI-40 protein). The CGI40 protein was found in a screen where novel human
genes evolutionary conserved in C. elegans were identified
[1]. The function of both CGI-40 and Q9NXL6 is
unknown. ZK721.1 has several worm homologs, one of
which is sid-1 (Q9GZC8). SID-1 has been identified as a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/85

protein that is required for systemic RNAi [25,26]. It was
predicted to have eleven transmembrane (TM) regions
and some of them have been experimentally verified [27].
The high number of TM regions suggests that SID-1 forms
a channel. Double stranded RNA is thought to diffuse
through this channel, leading to spreading of the RNA and
hence, a systemic RNAi effect. This idea is also supported
by the fact that no homolog of sid-1 has been found in
Drosophila, which can explain the observed absence of systemic RNAi in this organism [28,29]. Our analysis of
ZK721.1 predicts that it has ten TM regions, which makes
it a likely candidate for forming a channel. The phylogenetic tree indicates that ZK721.1 is the best candidate
ortholog to human genes Q9NXL6 and Q9Y357, whereas
sid-1 is a probable outparalog to the human genes (see Fig.
2D). The tree also supports the previous finding that there
is no homolog to ZK721.1 or sid-1 in the Drosophila
genome. We have observed a wildtype RNAi phenotype
for ZK721.1, which is consistent with results from other
studies [30,31]. Further analysis might reveal if ZK721.1
also is involved in systemic RNAi or if it has some other
function. Four additional genes required for systemic
RNAi have been reported (rsd-2, -3, -4 and -6) [26], but
none of them map to locus ZK721.1.
C30H6.2, H13N06.5, T01D3.5, T11F9.2 and T28F3.3
SLC39A4 (Q9H6T8) was identified as one of three possible human orthologs to C30H6.2. The human gene has
been implicated in the rare inherited condition acrodermatitis enteropathica, which results from a defect in the
absorption of zinc [32]. It is believed that SLC39A4 might
encode a zinc transporter responsible for intestinal
absorption of zinc. Therefore, C30H6.2 may also be a
zinc/metal transporter.

The predicted human ortholog (Q92504) to H13N06.5 in
C. elegans has been shown to be a zinc transporter localized to intracellular membranes [33]. Q92504 probably
transports zinc out of the endoplasmic reticulum and
other intracellular stores. The Drosophila ortholog to
H13N06.5 is Catsup (Catecholamines up, Q9V3A4), which
encodes a negative regulator of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)
activity [34]. TH is a rate-limiting enzyme for production
of dopamine in the brain. The Arabidopsis thaliana gene
IAR1 (Q9M647) is also an ortholog to H13N06.5. It is
proposed to be involved in auxin metabolism or response
[35]. Interestingly, the mouse ortholog (Q31125) to
H13N06.5 and IAR1 was shown to functionally substitute
for the Arabidopsis gene. These data indicate that there is
functional conservation among these orthologs and it is
likely that H13N06.5, and possibly also T28F3.3, could
play similar roles in the corresponding pathways in the
worm.

BMC Genomics 2004, 5:85

BIGM103 (Q9C0K1) was identified as one of four candidate human orthologs to T11F9.2. The human gene was
found to be induced during the infection and
inflammatory response. It was also shown to play a role in
intracellular zinc ion accumulation and retention [36].
Consequently, it is possible that T11F9.2 might be an integral membrane zinc/metal transporter.
The human ortholog to T01D3.5 has no known putative
function. We observed a wildtype RNAi phenotype for
T01D3.5 as well as for the other four PF02535 (ZIP)
domain containing putative proteins (C30H6.2,
H13N06.5, T11F9.2 and T28F3.3). This indicates that
there might be some functional redundancy between
these genes. Considering the information available, it is
conceivable that T01D3.5 may also be a zinc/metal
transporter.
F08F1.7, T04A8.12 and ZK858.6
F08F1.7 and ZK858.6 show 47% identity on the protein
sequence level and they have similar membrane topologies with a large N-terminal non-cytoplasmic region and
nine transmembrane regions in the C-terminal part.
F08F1.7 and one of the splice variants of ZK858.6 were
predicted to have a N-terminal signal peptide. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the human gene p76
(Q99805) is the ortholog to F08F1.7 and it appears to
localize to endosomes [37]. The function of the probable
human ortholog (Q92544) to ZK858.6 is unknown.

Both F08F1.7 and ZK858.6 are predicted to be in operons,
as is T04A8.12 [38]. F08F1.7 is probably in an operon
with tth-1 (F08F1.8, O17389). TTH-1 is likely to belong to
the PF01290 domain family (thymosin beta-4), which
includes actin-binding proteins, implicating a possible
role in cytoskeleton organization. ZK858.6 is predicted to
be in an operon with ZK858.5 (Q94421) and ZK858.7
(Q94416). A PF05154 (TM2) domain with unknown
function is likely to be present in ZK858.5. ZK858.7 might
have a PF04189 domain (eIF3gamma; eukaryotic initiation factor 3, gamma subunit), suggesting that it could be
involved in translation. T04A8.12 may be in an operon
with T04A8.11 (Q22140) and T04A8.13 (Q22142).
T04A8.11 might be a ribosomal protein, since it appears
to have a PF00252 (ribosomal L16) domain. T04A8.13
was predicted to have a PF00646 (F-box) domain, which
is known for forming structural complexes with other proteins. There are no matching Pfam-A domains for
T04A8.12. The best candidate human ortholog to
T04A8.12 is FRAG1 (fibroblast growth factor receptor activating gene 1, Q9UHJ9). FRAG1 seems to be ubiquitously
expressed in adult human tissues and it has also been
detected in several human tumor cell lines [39]. Our
results from the gene expression analysis demonstrated
that F08F1.7 is probably expressed in several tissues in C.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/85

elegans, suggesting an important biological role. Previous
studies have shown that the human ortholog p76
(Q99805) is ubiquitously expressed [37]. There was no
expression observed for ZK858.6 and for gene T04A8.12,
we failed to generate a transgenic line. All three genes
exhibited a wildtype RNAi phenotype. For F08F1.7 and
ZK858.6, the wildtype phenotype could possibly be
explained by functional redundancy between the two
genes and a third C. elegans EMP70 domain containing
protein Y41D4A.4 (Q95Y24). We found that Y41D4A.4 is
homologous to F08F1.7 and ZK858.6, and most likely an
ortholog to the human gene Q9HD45. Taken together,
these findings point to that F08F1.7, ZK858.6 and
T04A8.12 might play fundamental biological roles, and
that they may be involved in processes such as cellular
organization (F08F1.7) and translation (ZK858.6 and
T04A8.12).
F14F3.3 and R155.1
The human genes Q99908 (BB1) and Q96N66 are probable orthologs to F14F3.3. BB1 has been shown to be overexpressed in breast and bladder carcinoma [40],
suggesting that it might have a role in tumor progression.
The function of Q96N66 is unknown.

The likely Drosophila ortholog to R155.1 is Nessy
(Q9XYV9), a putative Hox gene target [41], indicating a
possible developmental role. The Dpy (dumpy) RNAi
phenotype detected for R155.1 could be due to some
developmental/body size regulatory error in possibly the
hypodermis and/or body wall muscle; tissues in which the
gene is expressed according to our analysis. The best
human ortholog candidate (Q92980) to R155.1 has not
yet been functionally characterized.
Y6B3B.10
Y6B3B.10 is most probably orthologous to the human
gene P27544 and they both seem to belong to the
PF03798 (LAG1) domain family. LAG1 is a longevity gene
that was cloned from yeast [42]. Members of the LAG1
family are thought to be involved in determining lifespan.
However, the phylogenetic tree revealed that Y6B3B.10
and its human and mouse ortholog (P27545) form a tight
cluster in the tree, separated from the other LAG1 domain
containing proteins, indicating that they may have
evolved a slightly different function. Y6B3B.10 showed a
wildtype RNAi phenotype and it appears to have an
expression restricted to the pharyngeal muscle.
D2013.10
D2013.10 is orthologous to Q15055 (human), Q8K1A5
(mouse) and Q9VX39 (Drosophila). Neither of these genes
has any putative function assigned to them and they have
no matching Pfam-A domains. D2013.10 is expressed in

several tissues in C. elegans and it exhibits a wildtype RNAi
phenotype.

Discussion
This study illustrates how bioinformatic and experimental
analysis can be combined to elucidate putative gene function. We have predicted worm-human orthologs and performed an initial functional characterization of the worm
genes. Since orthologs are likely to have the same
biological function, a better understanding of the function of the human genes can be accomplished through
analysis in C. elegans. The genes explored in this study
were selected from a previous study [5] and they are all
predicted to encode transmembrane proteins. Such proteins are attractive to study since many interesting receptors, channels, transporters and signaling proteins are
found among them, making them likely to be involved in
important regulatory processes in multicellular
organisms.
The number of transmembrane (TM) regions predicted
for each protein, is similar to the number predicted for
each cluster of putative TM proteins from the former study
(± 1 TM region) [5]. For the putative proteins H13N06.5,
F14F3.3 and ZK721.1, however, the difference is larger
(+2-3 TM regions). This divergence could be due to Remm
and Sonnhammer having performed predictions on a
cluster and not on individual genes. In addition, they used
only the program TMHMM [43] for analyzing membrane
topology. TMHMM, when using default settings, may
miss weak TM regions, leading to a possible underestimation of the number of TM segments. A better estimate of
the true topology can be achieved through the use of several different prediction programs. In this study, we used
the consensus of nine different methods provided by the
SFINX tool [8,9] to assign membrane topology.
We observed an RNAi phenotype for 11.8% (2 of 17) of
the genes when using both strains N2 (wildtype) and rrf3 (RNAi sensitive), respectively. This is in agreement with
previous experiments, where 10.3% (N2) and 12.8% (rrf3) phenotypes have been detected [30,44]. The RNAi phenotypes for sft-4 are consistent with previous results
[30,31]. However, the two groups have reported nonoverlapping phenotypes, but in this screen we have
observed all of them. The Lva (larval arrest) phenotype
has also been reported from the genome wide screen
using strain rrf-3 [44]. The Dpy (dumpy) phenotype for
R155.1 has not been reported before. The gene was downregulated using RNAi by injection in a screen of chromosome III [45] and the phenotype was found to be
wildtype. However, the focus of that analysis was to identify genes involved in cell division and therefore only a
few post-embryonic phenotypes were scored. The Dpy
phenotype observed is also low penetrant and relatively

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/85

weak and could therefore be missed. Furthermore, differences in results from RNAi screens have been shown to
exist. A 10–30% difference between experiments done in
both different and in the same laboratories has been
reported [44].
When analyzing expression patterns using transcriptional
reporter fusions, one issue of concern is whether the pattern observed is the expression pattern of the native gene
or not. Ectopic or lack of expression can occur if the
putative promoter used does not include all the regulatory
elements. Expression in several different cell types in the
pharynx and in the posterior intestinal cells of young animals has been attributed to the use of incomplete promoters
[46].
Another
limitation
when
using
extrachromosomal arrays is that analysis of expression in
the germ line is not possible, due to germ line silencing.
The putative promoter used in the transcriptional fusion
for C36B1.12 is only 1 kb, due to the presence of an
upstream gene. Therefore, it is possible that the intestinal
expression seen predominantly in young worms and
mostly located to posterior intestinal nuclei, is an artifact
of the use of an incomplete promoter region [46]. If this
is the case, C36B1.12 might be expressed exclusively in
neurons in the head (see Fig. 3). This finding provides
support to the idea that C36B1.12 and its three human
orthologs encode neuronal functions. A possible consequence of this could be that they act in a fashion analogous to presenilin, or even that they could be involved in
β-amyloid precursor protein processing. It would be interesting to study their role in nervous system development
and function, and whether they are linked to neurological
disorders
The transcriptional fusion for T28F3.3 also showed a similar intestinal expression, apart from the specific expression in neurons in the head, ventral nerve cord, vulva and
a weak expression in hypodermis. The putative promoter
region used is only 0.8 kb, due to the presence of an
upstream gene. Thus, the intestinal expression seen for
T28F3.3 may once again be related to the use of an incomplete promoter region [46].
Two of the transcriptional fusions (for the genes F14F3.3
and ZK858.6) showed no expression of the reporter gene.
This is unlikely due to the use of an incomplete promoter
region, since the upstream region included was 2.9 kb and
3.0 kb, respectively. Instead, it might be caused by conditional gene expression, germline silencing or absence of
the promoter::gfp fusion from the inheritable extrachromosomal array [46]. For three of the genes in this study we
failed to establish transgenic lines. Possible reasons for
this could be that the injected DNA concentration was too
low or that the sequence was toxic. In either case, the

Page 14 of 18

BMC Genomics 2004, 5:85

extrachromosomal array formed may not have been sufficiently large to be inheritable [46].
Out of the seventeen genes in this study, three are predicted to be in operons (18%). This is equivalent to the
number of genes in the C. elegans genome that are
believed to be in operons (15%). Whether C. elegans operons contain genes of related function or not is still
unknown. There are, however, some indications that
genes encoding proteins of fundamental biological
importance might be clustered into operons. For example,
genes for mitochondrial proteins have a strong tendency
to be together in operons and also genes encoding splicing proteins [38].

Conclusions
This study has shed some light upon the putative function
of a few predicted worm-human orthologs. Our aim was
to identify genes that could play a role in the nervous system and indeed we have been able to find eight genes that
appear to be expressed in neurons. C. elegans is an excellent model organism for pursuing the functional characterization of these genes, considering its well mapped and
relatively sophisticated nervous system. Investigating the
function of orthologous proteins using a simple multicellular organism is a suitable approach for the possibility of
learning more about the function of a gene not only in
one species but also hopefully in several. This approach
becomes even more valid as several genomes are being
sequenced at the moment with additional ones already in
the pipeline. With the enormous amount of data that
these sequencing efforts are generating, it is very useful to
be able to start delineating the gene function based on
functional characterization of the ortholog in another species, before initiating studies in more complex organisms.

Methods
Membrane topology predictions
The membrane topology was predicted with nine different
methods, and the SFINX tool [8,9], was used to display
the results. Eight membrane topology predictors were
used: Phobius [47], TMHMM2.0 [48], TMHMM1.0 [43],
PHDhtm [49], HMMTOP2.1 [50], HMMTOP1.0 [51],
MEMSAT [52] and TOPPRED [53]. In addition, a KyteDoolittle hydrophobicity curve [54] was constructed for
each putative protein sequence. Transmembrane regions
were considered positive if they were predicted by a
majority of the methods, or by four methods and having
a supporting Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity curve. Phobius also predicts N-terminal signal peptides. The signal
peptides predicted by Phobius were verified with
SignalP1.1 [55]. Each program was used with default
settings.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/85

Databases
The Pfamseq database version 10.0 [56] was used for
searching for homologous sequences. It is based on the
Swiss-Prot 41.10 and SP-TrEMBL 23.15 databases. The
Pfam database [11] version 11.0 [12] was used for domain
assignments.
Phylogenetic analysis
The Pfamseq database [56] was searched for homologs
using the Blastp 2.2.5 program [57] with default settings
and with the putative worm proteins as query. Multiple
alignments of full-length sequences were created using
POA [58] with default settings. Gappy sequences and columns (>50% gaps) and redundant sequences (>99%
identical) were removed. The program PHYLOWIN [59]
with tree building method neighbor-joining [60] and
PAM distance was used for constructing phylogenetic
trees. Trees were also built with observed divergence and
Poisson correction as distance methods, however, the
results from that analysis are only discussed for genes
where there were major differences in bootstrap support.
If available, a yeast sequence was used as an outgroup. A
total of 500 bootstrap tests were run on trees to assess the
significance of the branching order. Only bootstrap values
≥ 50% were considered positive.
Domain assignments
Pfam-A domains were assigned using the Pfam database
[11,12]. Pfam-B domains were not considered, since they
are automatically generated and non-curated and therefore of lower quality.
Nematode strains and culture conditions
Maintenance and handling of C. elegans strains were as
previously described [61]. Strains used were CGC N2
(wildtype) and CGC NL2099 (rrf-3(pk1426) II) [19]
(Caenorhabditis Genetics Center [62]). The rrf-3 mutant
strain has an increased sensitivity to RNAi, also for neuronal genes [20], which otherwise are more refractory
towards RNAi compared to other tissue types. Strain
CB00907 (dpy-5(e907) I) was used for generating the
transgenic lines [63].
RNAi screening
Generation and cloning of PCR products
Total RNA extracted and purified from C. elegans using
TRIzol (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) was
reverse transcribed using Reverse Transcription System
(Promega, Madison, WI) and then PCR products were
generated using Advantage™ 2 PCR Enzyme System
(Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) with gene specific primers as
well as primers for spliced leader 1 (SL1) and SL2 (Invitrogen Life Technologies): 95°C 60 s, 35 cycles of (95°C
30 s, 55°C 30 s, 68°C 4 min) followed by an additional
extension at 68°C 4 min. See additional data file 1 for the

primer sequences used for the RNAi studies. Products
were ligated into linearized (XmaI) (New England
Biolabs, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) and dephosphorylated L4440 vector (Fire Laboratory [64]) using Rapid
DNA Ligation Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and
transformed into JM109 E. coli bacterial strain (Promega).
Colonies were screened using XmaI, correct colonies were
grown in overnight cultures and DNA was extracted using
QIAfilter Plasmid Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The
vector with the insert was sequenced using ABI PRISM® Big
Dye™ Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kits
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
RNAi by feeding
Strains N2 and rrf-3 were used for RNAi screening by feeding [30,65]. CGC [62] bacterial strain E. coli HT115(DE3)
was transformed with the L4440 vector (Fire Laboratory
[64]) containing the cloned gene fragment using standard
methods. The vector contains an ampicillin (Amp) resistance and strain HT115 is tetracycline (Tet) resistant, so
bacteria were selected on Amp (75 µg/ml) and Tet (12.5
µg/ml) plates. Single colonies were picked and grown in
cultures of LB with Amp (60 µg/ml) and Tet (12.5 µg/ml)
for 14–17 h. The bacterial solution was seeded onto NGM
plates containing 1 mM IPTG and 25 µg/ml carbenicillin.
Seeded plates were allowed to dry at room temperature.
Eggs were prepared with standard bleaching method and
transferred to the plates. N2 strain was incubated at 15, 20
and 25°C. rrf-3 was incubated only at 15°C and 20°C,
since the strain has a temperature-sensitive decrease in
broodsize [20]. The hatched worms and their progeny
were scored for a number of different phenotypes [30,44].
The phenotypes assayed were: Adl (adult lethal), Bli (blistering of cuticle), Bmd (body morphology defect), Brd
(low broodsize), Clr (clear), Dpy (dumpy), Egl (egg laying
defect), Emb (embryonic lethal), Gro (slow post-embryonic growth), Him (high incidence of males), Lon (long
body), Lva (larval arrest), Lvl (larval lethal), Mlt (molt
defect), Muv (multivulva), Prz (paralyzed), Pvl (protruding vulva), Rol (roller), Rup (ruptured), Sck (sick), Sma
(small), Ste (sterile), Stp (sterile progeny), Unc (uncoordinated). Emb was defined as greater than 10% dead
embryos for N2 and greater than 30% dead embryos for
rrf-3. Ste and Stp required a brood size of fewer than ten
for N2 and fewer than five for rrf-3. Each postembryonic
phenotype was required to be present among at least 10%
of the analyzed worms. The experiment was ongoing for
about 4 generations and the phenotypes were scored on a
daily basis. A constant supply of transformed HT115 bacteria was ensured. The experiments were performed in
duplicates at each temperature for each gene and worm
strain. For the postembryonic phenotypes typically at least
20 worms per plate were scored. As a positive control the
gene unc-22 ("twitchin") was used (Fire Laboratory vector

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/85

pPD34.09 [64]). Empty L4440 vector was used as negative
control.
RNAi by injections
The L4440 vector (Fire Laboratory [64]) containing the
cloned gene fragment was linearized in two separate reactions using restriction enzymes NcoI and XhoI (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt am Main, Germany), respectively.
The reactions were purified and single stranded RNA was
synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). The two reactions were mixed and annealing
was performed to produce double stranded (ds) RNA,
which was subsequently purified. The dsRNA was injected
undiluted into twelve young adult N2 hermaphrodites for
each gene. The injected worms were put on individual
plates and split between three different incubation temperatures (15, 20 and 25°C). Phenotypes were scored for
both the injected worms and two subsequent generations
on a daily basis. Phenotypes scored and criteria for scoring
were the same as for the RNAi by feeding of strain N2.
Generation of transgenic lines
The transgenic lines were constructed at the Baille Laboratory, Simon Fraser University, Canada [66]. Transcriptional expression constructs for gonadal injection were
generated using fusion PCR, also known as "PCR-stitching" [67]. Typically, about 3 kb of genomic DNA sequence
immediately upstream of the predicted ATG initiator site,
was used as the putative promoter (see supplementary
material for primer sequences). When an upstream gene
was within the 3 kb, the size of the putative promoter was
adjusted downwards. For genes in operons, the sequence
upstream of the first gene in the operon was used. The
putative promoter was fused with another DNA fragment
containing gfp (green fluorescent protein) and unc-54
3'UTR amplified from vector pPD95.67 (Fire Laboratory
[64]). See additional data file 1 for the primer sequences
used for generating the fusion PCR products. The resulting
fusion PCR product was injected without purification into
the gonad of young adult hermaphrodites of strain
CB00907 at a concentration of 10 ng/µl together with 100
ng/µl dpy-5(+) plasmid (pCeh361) in 1xTE buffer to generate an extrachromosomal array. Analysis of the expression patterns of the different transgenic lines was
performed at the Vaz Gomes Laboratory, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden.
