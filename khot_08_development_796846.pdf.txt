Abstract
Background: The diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) remains challenging. Culture
and histopathological examination of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid are useful but have
suboptimal sensitivity and in the case of culture may require several days for fungal growth to be
evident. Detection of Aspergillus DNA in BAL fluid by quantitative PCR (qPCR) offers the potential
for earlier diagnosis and higher sensitivity. It is important to adopt quality control measures in PCR
assays to address false positives and negatives which can hinder accurate evaluation of diagnostic
performance.
Methods: BAL fluid from 94 episodes of pneumonia in 81 patients was analyzed. Thirteen episodes
were categorized as proven or probable IPA using Mycoses Study Group criteria. The pellet and
the supernatant fractions of the BAL were separately assayed. A successful extraction was
confirmed with a human 18S rRNA gene qPCR. Inhibition in each qPCR was measured using an
exogenous DNA based internal amplification control (IAC). The presence of DNA from pathogens
in the Aspergillus genus was detected using qPCR targeting fungal 18S rRNA gene.
Results: Human 18S rRNA gene qPCR confirmed successful DNA extraction of all samples. IAC
detected some degree of initial inhibition in 11 samples. When culture was used to diagnose IPA,
the sensitivity and specificity were 84.5% and 100% respectively. Receiver-operating characteristic
analysis of qPCR showed that a cutoff of 13 fg of Aspergillus genomic DNA generated a sensitivity,
specificity, positive and negative predictive value of 77%, 88%, 50%, 96% respectively. BAL pellet
and supernatant analyzed together resulted in sensitivity and specificity similar to BAL pellet alone.
Some patients did not meet standard criteria for IPA, but had consistently high levels of Aspergillus
DNA in BAL fluid by qPCR.
Conclusion: The Aspergillus qPCR assay detected Aspergillus DNA in 76.9% of subjects with proven
or probable IPA when the concentrated BAL fluid pellet fraction was used for diagnosis. There was
no benefit from analyzing the BAL supernatant fraction. Use of both extraction and amplification
controls provided optimal quality control for interpreting qPCR results and therefore may increase
our understanding of the true potential of qPCR for the diagnosis of IPA.

Background
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a common
infection in patients with hematological malignancies
and those undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation
[1]. Despite the availability of several active antifungal
agents, IPA continues to have a high mortality rate [2].
The diagnosis of IPA remains a challenge [3,4]. Most
symptoms are non-specific, such as fever, cough, or chest
pain, and many patients have no symptoms at all.
Although some radiographic findings in the lungs can
suggest aspergillosis, such as the presence of a halo sign
(ground glass opacity surrounding a nodule) or cavitating
nodules, these findings can also be found in subjects with
pulmonary zygomycosis or other infections and are thus
again not necessarily specific [5]. The failure to make an
accurate diagnosis frequently results in the use of empirical antifungal therapy in the suitable immunocompromised host.
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid is routinely used to
assess for the presence of fungi at the site of pulmonary
infection. Conventional microbiological techniques like
culture and histology of BAL fluid are most commonly
used for the diagnosis of IPA, but have suboptimal sensitivity, and in the case of culture may take several days [68]. Detection of the fungal cell wall constituents like galactomannan (in serum and BAL fluid) and beta-glucan (in
serum) are promising diagnostic alternatives to facilitate
the diagnosis of invasive fungal infection, but false positive and false negative results remain problematic with
both assays [9-11]. Molecular diagnostic techniques such
as nucleic acid detection by PCR are emerging as potentially more sensitive and rapid alternatives to conventional techniques for the diagnosis of IPA [12-19]. Our
study focuses on developing a quantitative PCR (qPCR)
platform to detect Aspergillus DNA in BAL as an indicator
of IPA.
Quantitative PCR has several advantages when used for
the detection of Aspergillus spp. First, qPCR is highly sensitive with the potential to detect a few gene copies per reaction, or less than a single genome for multicopy genes
such as the rRNA gene. Second, by taking advantage of
both conserved and variable regions of genes, primers and
probes can be made that are specific for a given genus, species or strain of microbe. Third, qPCR can measure the
amount of microbial DNA in a clinical sample, which
may be useful for assessing the burden of infection and in
distinguishing between colonization and infection.
Fourth, multiplexed qPCR reactions can reduce the necessity of running independent qPCRs allowing for the detection of multiple targets or for inclusion of amplification
controls in a single reaction. Fifth, qPCR assays can be
completed in a few hours, resulting in a rapid turn around
time for reporting results. However, to develop an optimal

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/73

qPCR assay for diagnosis, several challenges and shortcomings should be addressed to avoid false positive and
false negative results [20-22]. False negatives can occur
due to suboptimal DNA extraction (i.e. low recovery of
DNA and/or the presence of PCR inhibitors), large quantities of human genomic DNA competing with the microbial target for amplification, and suboptimal analytical
sensitivity of the qPCR reaction itself (high detection
threshold). False positives can occur due to introduction
of contamination during sample collection, DNA extraction, and PCR set-up, resulting from the presence of fungi
in the environment or fungal PCR product carry-over. In
addition, false positives can occur in the setting of suboptimal analytical specificity in the qPCR, resulting from
cross-reactivity of the target qPCR assay with other (nontarget) fungi or DNA. Optimal qPCR assays should incorporate controls to assess for these factors contributing to
false positive and false negative results, but most studies
published to date have not. A major hurdle to the wider
adoption of PCR for the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections is the lack of standardization among assays. It is
important that investigators in the field adopt standards
for ruling out false positive and false negative results, as
this will allow for more accurate comparisons among different assay platforms.
Many studies have used BAL fluid for the diagnosis of fungal pneumonia using PCR, but the best fraction of BAL
fluid to use for this purpose has not been defined. It is
unclear if the majority of Aspergillus DNA in BAL fluid is
contained in intact cells or is cell-free DNA that results
from lysis of fungi in vivo. We hypothesized that if most
of the Aspergillus DNA is present in intact cells, then detection can be maximized by concentrating the cellular fraction of the BAL into a pellet by centrifugation before
subjecting this smaller volume to DNA extraction. If cellfree Aspergillus DNA is the dominant form in BAL fluid,
then qPCR should detect equal or greater amounts of
DNA in this larger supernatant fraction.
To optimize our qPCR assay platform for the diagnosis of
IPA, we developed a panel of qPCR assays, including
amplification and extraction controls, and modified a
DNA extraction technique to increase yields of fungal
DNA from BAL fluid. This optimized assay was tested on
sequentially obtained BAL samples collected from
patients with hematological malignancies or undergoing
hematopoietic cell transplantation at the Seattle Cancer
Care Alliance who developed pneumonia or pulmonary
nodules. In an initial analysis, both the pellet and supernatant fractions of the BAL were assayed to determine the
optimal fraction for detecting Aspergillus DNA. The performance of our qPCR assay was compared with the conventional microbiological techniques of culture and
histology.

Methods
Study population and design
Patients with hematological malignancies or undergoing
hematopoietic cell transplantation at the Seattle Cancer
Care Alliance who developed pneumonia or pulmonary
nodules underwent bronchoscopy with BAL. BAL fluid
remaining after conventional microbiological and cytologic evaluations was processed as noted in the next subsection. This was a retrospective study analyzing BAL fluid
samples obtained from April 2002 to July 2003, and was
approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. This study involved
81 patients, 94 episodes of pneumonia, and 144 BAL samples. Note that multiple lobes were lavaged at the time of
bronchoscopy in most subjects, resulting in an average of
more than one BAL sample per episode. Analysis was
done on an episode basis, with an episode defined as a
single radiographically and temporally related pneumonia. If a subject had resolution of pulmonary infiltrates
with appearance of a new infiltrate at a later time, this was
considered a separate episode. Figure 1 depicts the algorithm used for the diagnosis of IPA using qPCR. Patients
with proven or probable IPA were diagnosed using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/73

Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria [23]. Designation of clinical status was performed by an investigator
who was blinded to qPCR results, with host factors, clinical criteria, and microbiological criteria abstracted from
the medical record and entered into a relational database.
Processing of BAL fluid
The starting volume of BAL fluid was in the range of 2 to
5 ml. BAL fluid was centrifuged at 3200 rcf for 15 min at
4°C. The pellet was resuspended in a small volume of
supernatant, with the final pellet fraction having a volume
of 100 to 400 μl, depending on the degree of cellularity.
The pellet and the remaining supernatant fraction were
frozen in separate tubes at -80°C until DNA extraction.
DNA extraction from BAL fractions
DNA extraction of clinical samples and PCR set up was
performed in a laminar flow hood within a laboratory
that was exclusively used for pre-PCR processing. An optimized version of the MasterPure™ Yeast DNA Purification
Kit (Epicentre® Biotechnologies, Madison, WI) was used
for BAL DNA extraction. The 100% isopropanol, 70% ethanol and DNA grade water used for extraction were filtered in an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit with a

molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of 30 kDa (Millipore
Corporation, Billerica, MA). Yeast Cell Lysis™ solution
and MPC Protein Precipitation Reagent™ were UV irradiated at 240 mJ/cm2 with samples approximately 15 centimetres from the bulbs (Spectrolinker™, Westbury, NY).
The silicon carbide sharps were washed 10 times in DNA
free water and baked at 180°C for 48 h. DNA-free microcentrifuge tubes were used with DNA extraction (Eppendorf Biopur tubes, Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany).
Sham digest controls consisting of DNA free water were
processed with every extraction run serving as negative
controls to monitor for fungal contamination.
DNA was independently extracted from the pellet and
supernatant fractions of the BAL; no whole BAL was processed. In the case of the supernatant fraction, extraction
started with 0.5 ml of the supernatant from the protein
precipitation step onwards. For the pellet fraction, an
additional bead beating step was included. Two milliliter
sterile screw-cap tubes were loaded with silicon carbide
sharps of sizes 0.1 mm and 1 mm (BioSpec Products, Inc.,
Bartlesville, OK) at a 1:1 ratio up to a volume equivalent
to 250 μl. Yeast Cell Lysis™ solution at a volume of 550 μl
and BAL pellet at 100 – 400 μl, or 200 μl of water as digest
control, were added to the tube. The contents of the tube
were homogenized in a FastPrep®-24 System (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) at 5 m/s for 60 s. Each tube was incubated at 65°C for 45 min then kept on ice for 5 min. MPC
Protein Precipitation Reagent™ was added at a volume of
325 μl for pellet and 450 μl for supernatant processing.
The tubes were vortexed for 10 s and centrifuged at 11,000
rcf for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was transferred
to a new micro-centrifuge tube containing an equal volume of 100% isopropanol pre-cooled to -20°C. The contents of the tube were mixed thoroughly by inversion and
incubated at -20°C for 1 hour. Precipitated DNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 11,000 rcf for 10 min. This
supernatant was removed and discarded. The pellet containing DNA was resuspended in 0.5 ml of pre-cooled (20°C) 70% ethanol and vortexed. The tube was then centrifuged at 11,000 rcf for 5 min. This supernatant was
removed to a level just short of disturbing the pellet. The
remaining volume of ethanol was allowed to evaporate by
air drying for 5 min within the laminar flow hood. The
pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 0.1% Triton-X prewarmed to 65°C then incubated at room temperature for
one minute with periodic gentle vortexing. The DNA was
either used immediately for qPCR, stored at -20°C overnight or at -80°C for longer periods. If PCR inhibition was
detected in the extracted samples, they were reprocessed
from the protein precipitation step onwards (see Figure
1).
Preparation of fungal genomic DNA
Genomic DNA from fungi was extracted with an optimized MasterPure™ Yeast DNA Purification Kit (Epicen-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/73

tre® Biotechnologies, Madison, WI) in order to assess assay
analytical sensitivity and specificity. Fungi were transferred into micro-centrifuge tubes from liquid media and
centrifuged. Cell pellets were washed with 1 ml 1× PBS
and centrifuged at 10,000 rcf for 3 min. The supernatant
was discarded and cells resuspended in 500 μl Yeast Cell
Lysis™ solution. The tube was vortexed at top speed for 10
s. The tube was incubated at 65°C for 1 h and then kept
on ice for 5 min. For filamentous fungi, the pellet was
ground with a micropestle at the start and during the
65°C incubation. Protein Precipitation Reagent™ was
added at a volume of 400 μl to the tube and vortexed for
10 s. The tube was centrifuged to pellet cellular debris at
11,000 rcf for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to
a new micro-centrifuge tube containing an equal volume
of 100% isopropanol pre-cooled to -20°C. The contents
of the tube were thoroughly mixed by inversion and incubated at -20°C for 1 hr. Precipitated DNA was pelleted by
centrifugation at 11,000 rcf for 10 min. The supernatant
was removed and discarded. The pellet containing DNA
was resuspended in pre-cooled (-20°C) 1 ml of 70% ethanol and vortexed at maximum speed for 10 s. The tube
was then centrifuged at 11,000 rcf for 5 min. This supernatant was removed to a level just short of disturbing the
pellet. The remaining volume was allowed to evaporate by
air drying for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl
of 0.1% Triton-X pre-warmed to 65°C and incubated at
room temperature for 1 min with periodic gentle vortexing. The total nucleic acid in the extract was quantified
using a UV spectrophotometer. For every 149 μg of total
nucleic acid in the extract, 10 U of RiboShredder™ RNase
Blend (Epicentre® Biotechnologies, Madison, WI) was
used to remove RNA. RNA removal was confirmed by visualizing the pre- and post-treatment extract on a 1.5%
agarose gel. DNA was quantified using a Qubit™ instrument and Quant-iT™ dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen
Corporation, Carlsbad, CA).
Quantitative PCR assays
Quantitative PCR assays in this study were based on Taqman™ chemistry and an Applied Biosystems 7500™ realtime instrument was used for detection. To prevent contamination, each PCR master mix without additional
water component was filtered through a Microcon YM100 centrifugal filter unit with a MWCO of 100 kDa (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA) at 650 rcf for 25 min
and 1500 rcf for an additional 5 min before use. The additional water was independently filtered with an Amicon
Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit with a MWCO of 30 kDa
using. DNA-free microcentrifuge tubes were used with the
PCR set up (Eppendorf Biopur tubes, Eppendorf AG,
Hamburg, Germany). No-template controls were run with
each qPCR assay to monitor contamination. Each
extracted BAL sample was run in duplicate reactions. Samples were interpreted as positive if both duplicates showed
an increase in normalized relative florescence above the

background and the multicomponent view demonstrated
an increase in absolute florescence (as estimated by the
7500 System SDS software, Applied Biosystems).

again.

Uracil N-glycosylase activation at 50°C for 2 min, premelt at 95°C for 10 min and then 45 cycles of 95°C for 15
s (melt) and 65°C for 65 s (annealing and extension). A
standard curve for quantifying Aspergillus DNA was generated using Aspergillus fumigatus genomic DNA (ATCC #
MYA-1163) dilutions ranging from 1000 pg to 30 fg. All
positive Aspergillus qPCRs for the first 48 episodes were
subjected to sequencing using Big Dye terminators and an
Applied Biosystems capillary sequencer to confirm identity with the expected target.

(ii) Extraction control qPCR
Successful DNA extraction was confirmed in all samples
with a qPCR targeting the human 18S rRNA gene with forward primer 5'- CTC TTA GCT GAG TGT CCC GC -3',

consisted of an Uracil N-glycosylase activation at 50°C for
2 min, pre-melt at 95°C for 10 min and then 38 cycles of
95°C for 15 s (melt) and 65°C for 65 s (annealing and
extension). A standard curve for quantifying human DNA
was generated using human genomic DNA (Roche
Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN) with dilutions ranging from 10,000 to 1 pg.

Analytical specificity testing
The analytical specificity of the Aspergillus qPCR was
assessed by testing 1000 pg of genomic DNA from 29 different fungal species spanning 15 genera grown in culture.
The following clinically or phylogenetically relevant fungal pathogens were chosen: Aspergillus fumigatus (ATCC #
MYA-1163), Aspergillus oryzae (ATCC # 20719), Aspergillus
ustus (ATCC # 20063), Aspergillus candidus (ATCC #
20022), Aspergillus terreus (ATCC # 10070), Aspergillus flavus (ATCC # MYA-3631), Candida albicans (ATCC #
90028), Candida glabrata (ATCC # 90876), Candida kefyr
(ATCC # 28838), Candida guilliermondii (ATCC # 90877),
Candida lusitaniae (ATCC # 42720), Candida dubliniensis
(ATCC # MYA-580), Scedosporium apiospermum (ATCC #
28206), Scedosporium prolificans (ATCC # 90468), Paecilomyces variotti (ATCC # 10865), Penicillium chrysogenum
(ATCC # 10108), Rhizopus oryzae (ATCC # 10260), Rhodotorula glutinis (ATCC # 16726), Absidia corymbifera (ATCC
# 14058), Fusarium solani (ATCC # 56480), Mucor racemosus (ATCC # 42647), Rhizomucor miehei (ATCC # 46345),
Cunninghamella bertholletiae (ATCC # 42155), Trichosporon
cutaneum (ATCC # 38300), Candida parapsilosis (clinical
isolate), Candida tropicalis (clinical isolate), Candida krusei
(clinical isolate), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Novagen, Madison, WI), and Cryptococcus neoformans (ATCC # 28958D5). Cross-reactivity with 1 μg of human genomic DNA was
also assessed.

(iii) Aspergillus targeted 18S qPCR
The Aspergillus targeted qPCR amplified a 114 bp segment
of the Aspergillus 18S rRNA gene with forward primer 5'GAT AAC GAA CGA GAC CTC GG -3', reverse primer 5'AGA CCT GTT ATT GCC GCG C -3' and probe 5'-FAM CTT

Data analysis
Quantitative PCR results were compared with clinical
diagnoses based on the EORTC/MSG criteria. Sensitivity,
specificity and positive and negative likelihood ratios with
their associated 95% confidence intervals were calculated.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/73

The negative and positive predictive values (NPV and
PPV) were also calculated for these sequentially obtained
samples. These diagnostic parameters were also calculated
for culture, histology and both culture and histology combined. A receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis
was done using a computer program written with MathWorks MATLAB® software to assess how changing qPCR
detection threshold affects sensitivity and 1-specificity.

Results
Demographic characteristics of the patient population
Of the 81 subjects with pneumonia or pulmonary nodules studied, 60 (74.1%) underwent hematopoietic cell
transplantation and the remainder of the subjects had a
diagnosis of leukaemia, lymphoma or another neoplastic
condition (see Table 1). Accordingly, the study population represents a group of patients at very high risk for
invasive aspergillosis based on risk factors such as underlying malignancy, neutropenia and use of steroids.
Analytical sensitivity and specificity of the qPCR assays
The Aspergillus qPCR standard curve of genomic Aspergillus
DNA consistently yielded R2 (goodness-of-fit) values >
0.98, which enabled quantification. The Aspergillus qPCR
could reliably detect down to a threshold cycle (Ct) of 41
which is approximately equivalent to 1 fg of Aspergillus
genomic DNA or a single copy of the target 18S rRNA
gene.

To determine the specificity of the Aspergillus qPCR, 1 μg
of human DNA and 1000 pg of fungal DNA from 29 species spanning 15 genera were tested in the Aspergillus
qPCR assay. Only Penicillium notatum and Paecilomyces
variotii had significant cross-reactivity, with similar levels
of Aspergillus DNA reported with addition of 1000 pg
DNA from these species. Cross-reactivity studies of the
Aspergillus qPCR with human DNA revealed that 10 fg of
Aspergillus DNA could be successfully amplified in the
presence of 1 μg of human DNA per reaction. In actual
BAL clinical samples, as little as 20 fg of Aspergillus DNA
was detected in the presence of 550 ng of human DNA per
reaction. These results demonstrate that very small quantities of Aspergillus DNA (< 1 genome) can be detected in
a background of large amounts of human DNA (109 fold
excess DNA by mass) using this assay. BAL samples from
the first 48 episodes consisting of 10 true positives where
an amplification product was detected were sequenced
and confirmed to have DNA that matched the Aspergillus
genus for each episode. Based on this high concordance
rate sequencing was not performed for the subsequent 46
episodes.
The analytical sensitivity of the human 18S rRNA gene targeted extraction control qPCR was tested with human
genomic DNA. The extraction control qPCR could reliably
detect down to 37 Ct which is approximately equivalent
to 1 pg of human genomic DNA or one-third of a human
genome or 88 copies of the target 18S rRNA gene. The

standard curve of human genomic DNA consistently
yielded R2 (goodness-of-fit) values > 0.98 for the human
18S rRNA gene qPCR, which enabled quantification of
amounts of cellular material in BAL fluid.
Extraction control qPCR
The extraction control qPCR qualitatively confirmed successful DNA extraction and estimated the amount of
human genomic DNA present in all 144 BAL samples. The
median amount of human genomic DNA per BAL pellet
was 2.08 μg/pellet (52.1 ng per qPCR reaction) with a
range of 9 ng to 58.8 μg per pellet. The amount of
genomic DNA in the supernatant fraction was relatively
low at a median of 88.8 ng/ml of BAL supernatant and
had a range of 0.05 ng to 22.43 μg per ml BAL supernatant.
Internal amplification control analysis of PCR inhibition
The IAC signal in the no-template controls was compared
with the IAC signal of the BAL sample. A delay of 2 Ct
(equivalent to a 3-fold change in quantity) or greater in
duplicate qPCR reactions was used as a cut-off to classify
a sample as having significant qPCR inhibition. The IAC
multiplexed with the Aspergillus 18S was more useful in
detecting inhibition when compared with the IAC multiplexed with the extraction control assay. This is because
the IAC signal in the extraction control was at a severe
competitive disadvantage due to the large amounts of
human DNA present in each sample. The IAC multiplexed
with the Aspergillus 18S assay detected significant inhibition in 11 samples. Inhibition in all these samples was
overcome by re-extraction from the protein precipitation
step onwards without significant loss of DNA as assessed
by the extraction control qPCR (Fig. 1). When the reextracted samples were assayed again, the IAC did not
detect any inhibition.
Contamination control
Sham digest controls were negative for Aspergillus DNA,
showing that no fungal contamination was evident in the
DNA extraction reagents. No-template controls were also
negative, showing that fungal DNA contamination was
not detected in the PCR reagents.
Determination of the optimal fraction for detection of
Aspergillus DNA in BAL fluid
After processing 66 BAL fluid samples from 48 episodes of
pneumonia, data analysis was done to evaluate which
fraction of BAL fluid contains the most Aspergillus DNA.
Ten episodes were categorized as proven or probable IPA
in this cohort of 48 episodes; within these 10 episodes,
Aspergillus DNA was detected in 7 of 10 for the pellet fraction and in only 4 of 10 for the supernatant fraction. All
positive supernatant fractions also had a positive pellet
fraction. Of all qPCR positive BALs, an average of 98.3 ±

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/73

3.8% of total Aspergillus DNA from both fractions was
seen in the pellet. Analysis of BAL pellet and supernatant
results together conferred sensitivity and specificity identical to that of BAL pellet alone. It should be noted that
although the supernatant fraction had low sensitivity
(40%), it was highly specific in identifying episodes with
proven or probable IPA (specificity 100%). Since BAL
fluid supernatant did not appear to add meaningfully to
the diagnostic yield, further analysis of BAL samples
focused on analysis of BAL pellet fractions.
Diagnostic utility of the Aspergillus qPCR, culture and
histology
Table 2 summarizes the key diagnostic parameters of the
qPCR assay, culture, and histology in detecting the presence of Aspergillus in BAL fluid. ROC analysis of qPCR
showed that a cut-off of 13 fg of Aspergillus genomic DNA
per BAL pellet (corresponding to approximately 41 cycles)
generated good sensitivity and specificity (Fig. 2). Based
on this cut-off, the Aspergillus qPCR assay detected 10 of
13 episodes with proven or probable IPA (sensitivity
76.9%) and 8 out of 81 episodes without proven or probable IPA (specificity 90.1%). The positive and negative
predictive values were 58% and 94%. For all BALs with
any Aspergillus DNA detected by qPCR, the median quantity of Aspergillus DNA was 173 fg with a range of 4 fg to >
1500 pg per pellet.

BAL culture was somewhat more sensitive than qPCR in
detecting IPA (sensitivity 84.6 %) and had high specificity
(100%). Histology on the other hand was less sensitive
(53.8%), but had high specificity (100%). When culture
and histology were used in combination, the sensitivity
increased slightly to 85.7% and specificity remained at
100%. There was only a single episode with proven or
probable IPA in which the histology was positive when
the culture was negative. For this episode, the Aspergillus
qPCR was convincingly positive with 2 pg of Aspergillus
DNA found in the pellet. Two episodes with proven or
probable IPA which were culture positive were not positive for qPCR or histology. It should be noted that in these
episodes the culture was positive for Aspergillus at a single
CFU level. One episode with proven or probable IPA
showed no evidence of Aspergillus by culture or histology
and was also negative by Aspergillus qPCR–this subject had
a lung biopsy shortly after BAL fluid acquisition that confirmed IPA.
The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) calculated between
the fungal burden estimated by qPCR and the number of
colony forming units detected by culture in BAL was 0.93
(95% C.I. of 0.85 – 0.97, df = 25, p < 0.01), suggesting a
strong relationship between these two independent measures of fungal burden. The 95% confidence intervals were
estimated based on the Fisher r-to-z transformation.

0.23 ng (Table 4). This could imply that enough cellular
mass was not sampled during bronchoscopy which could
in turn affect the chance of sampling fungal cells from the
potential site of infection.

False positive (FP) and false negative (FN) results based on
qPCR
Tables 3 and 4 show information about the false positive
and false negative cases as identified by qPCR. Some
patients did not meet standard criteria for IPA, but had
consistently high levels of Aspergillus DNA in BAL fluid by
qPCR based on repeated assays (Table 3). Since the notemplate controls and digest controls were consistently
negative, the FPs could not be directly attributed to contamination from DNA extraction or qPCR reagents.

All 3 FNs were negative for histology (Table 4). One
(patient #9) was also negative for culture and the other
two FNs (patient # 10 and 11) had positive culture values
reported at a level of 1 CFU. These low or negative culture
values could potentially reflect lower fungal burden in the
BALs which could impact detection by qPCR. The IAC
analysis ruled out PCR inhibition as a cause for FNs. In
addition, the human genomic DNA amounts in the BAL
pellets of FN samples were well within the tested limits of
cross-reactivity with amplification by Aspergillus qPCR and
hence inhibition due to human genomic DNA overload
does not appear to be a factor affecting FN results. It is
worthy to note that FN patient # 9 had the lowest amount
of human genomic DNA per reaction of the entire study at

Despite the availability of new mould-active antifungal
medications such as extended spectrum azoles (voriconazole, posaconazole) and echinocandins, aspergillosis
remains a significant cause of death in patients with cancer. Delays in the institution of appropriate antifungal
therapy may contribute to the high mortality seen with
IPA, and the diagnosis of aspergillosis remains a clinical
challenge, enhancing the potential for delay [1,3]. Molecular diagnostic techniques such as detection of Aspergillus
DNA in BAL fluid using PCR are promising approaches
that may facilitate rapid diagnosis, but published studies
[12] tend to lack key quality control standards that are
useful in identifying problems with false negative and
false positive results within a study. Furthermore, the lack
of appropriate controls affects the ability to coherently
compare different published diagnostic PCR platforms for
IPA [12,21,22,25]. We developed a qPCR approach for the
diagnosis of IPA that incorporates rigorous quality control
steps designed to determine if fungal contamination is
introduced at the DNA extraction or PCR set up stages, if
human DNA is present in the extracted samples and at
what level (extraction control), if PCR inhibitors are
present after DNA extraction and to what extent they
cause inhibition (internal amplification control), and if
large amounts of human genomic DNA impede the
Aspergillus qPCR.
Many studies have been published describing various PCR
assays for the diagnosis of IPA using BAL fluid, but the distribution of Aspergillus DNA in BAL fluid has not been systematically evaluated. We assayed the BAL pellet and
supernatant fractions separately for the first 66 BALs
(equivalent to 48 episodes) in order to identify the most
useful fraction for diagnosis. Our results showed that
98.3% of Aspergillus DNA in BAL fluid is cell-associated,
most likely as either intact fungal cells or as fungi engulfed
by leukocytes. The most significant implication of this
result is that the diagnostic yield may increase by centrifuging large volumes of BAL fluid and subjecting the pellet
to a single extraction. There was no diagnostic benefit
from analyzing BAL supernatant as it was positive only
when the pellet was positive for Aspergillus DNA. The
Aspergillus DNA detected in the supernatant may have
resulted from low-level lysis of Aspergillus cells and release
of DNA either in vivo (bronchial lining fluid), or in vitro
after BAL fluid collection. Attempts to concentrate
Aspergillus DNA in the supernatant fraction using ultrafiltration provided no additional value but rather resulted in
losses of DNA when compared to the original supernatant

extract (data not shown). The BAL fluid pellet appears to
be the best fraction for use in the diagnosis of IPA.
Aspergillus conidia are ubiquitous in the environment, creating the potential for false positive fungal PCR results
when highly sensitive PCR assays are employed [21]. Fungal cells or fungal DNA can enter the assay process at
numerous points, including at the time of BAL collection,
during DNA extraction, or at qPCR set up. UV irradiation
and ultrafiltration have been previously used to control
PCR contamination [26-28]. Apart from processing samples in a laminar flow hood within a laboratory that was
exclusively used for pre-PCR processing, we used UV irradiation, filtration of solutions, and baking of beads and
glassware as additional tools to eliminate potential contaminants present in the extraction and PCR reagents. The
Yeast Cell Lysis Solution™ and the Protein Precipitation
Reagent™ (Epicentre® Biotechnologies, Madison, WI) used
in DNA extraction could be UV irradiated without loss of
function (data not shown). The silicon carbide sharps
used in the bead beating step of DNA extraction were specifically chosen from a wide array of materials for their
ability to remain chemically and physically stable through
a 2-day baking period required to eliminate any contaminating nucleic acids. The organic solvents used in DNA
extraction were filtered through a membrane with MWCO
of 30 kDa. The qPCR mastermix reagents were carefully
selected such that they could all be filtered through a
membrane of 100 kDa MWCO. The nucleotide cut-off for
a 30 kDa filter was 60 bases of single stranded DNA and
50 bp double stranded DNA, and for a 100 kDa filter was
300 bases single stranded DNA and 125 bp double
stranded DNA. Even though our Aspergillus qPCR amplicon was 114 bp long (estimated MW of 70 kDa in its double stranded form), we could consistently prevent
contamination of the PCR reagents. To minimize any contamination emerging from the IAC qPCR, the IAC primers, probe and template, which were multiplexed with the

target qPCR assays, were also filtered as part of the mastermix. The size of the IAC template was designed to be 105
bases long such that it could easily filter through a membrane of 100 kDa MWCO. Another source of contamination in PCR assays may arise from amplicon carry-over
contamination from previous PCR runs of the same assay.
In addition to strictly isolating pre- from post-PCR work,
a uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG) enzyme step was incorporated prior to PCR in combination with use of the nucleotide 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate (dUTP) to degrade
previous PCR products and prevent carry-over contamination. The water-only sham digest controls and no-template PCR controls used with every experiment were
consistently negative confirming that we were able to control contamination originating from the DNA extraction
and PCR set ups.
Another factor contributing to FPs can be cross-reactivity
of the Aspergillus qPCR assay with non-Aspergillus fungi.
Extensive analytical specificity testing showed that among
the 23 non-Aspergillus fungal species, our Aspergillus qPCR
assay had significant cross-reactivity only with Penicillium
chrysogenum and Paecilomyces variotii. P. chrysogenum is a
ubiquitous fungus closely related to A. fumigatus. It is
rarely associated with human opportunistic infections. P.
variotii is an opportunistic human pathogen, but voriconazole, which is considered first line therapy targeting
Aspergillus species, is also active against P. variotii. Thus the
clinical ramifications of incorrectly calling a Paecilomyces
infection an Aspergillus infection are likely to be small. The
galactomannan antigen assay for diagnosis of aspergillosis is also susceptible to false positive results due to crossreactivity with antigens from these two fungal species
[10].
Although qPCR assays can detect down to a few target
molecules of template per reaction, DNA extraction of
fungal pathogens from clinical samples remains the bot-

tleneck of PCR diagnostics [29-31]. Each BAL sample may
consist of sterile saline (lavage fluid), fungal cells, biological components which may be PCR inhibitors (e.g. heme
and mucus), and a large amount of human cells. Our previous work evaluated the utility of 6 commercial fungal
DNA extraction kits [30]. Based on optimizing fungal
DNA yields and minimizing FP and FN results, we
selected the MasterPure™ Yeast DNA Purification Kit (Epicentre® Biotechnologies, Madison, WI) for this study. The
DNA extraction protocol was further optimized by adding
silicon carbide sharps for lysis of fungal cell wall which
significantly enhanced extraction yields. The extraction
control qPCR qualitatively confirmed successful extractions and gave a quantitative measure of the amount of
human genomic DNA present in every BAL extract. In
addition, it helped guarantee that the BAL fluid contacted
a human mucosal surface and that DNA was not significantly degraded. Although processing fungal cells in parallel to asses extraction efficiency has been suggested as a
more accurate measure, such an approach brings with it
the high probability of introducing fungal contamination
in the pre-PCR processing lab and is thus a serious drawback. We avoided processing and extraction of fungal cells
from external sources to minimize the potential for false
positive PCR results. We verified the ability of our Aspergillus qPCR assay to successfully amplify 10 fg of A. fumigatus
genomic DNA (< 1 Aspergillus genome) in the presence of
1 μg of human genomic DNA per reaction (109 fold excess
human DNA). The human 18S rRNA gene PCR extraction
control measurements helped validate that human
genomic DNA in actual PCR reactions derived from BAL
fluid was well within these limits, providing evidence that
human DNA did not interfere with assay performance
leading to false negative results.

It has been suggested that an IAC is critical for assessing
PCR inhibition in every sample to rule out inhibition as a
cause for FNs [20,32]. Very few studies related to fungal
PCR diagnostics analyzing BAL fluid have incorporated an
IAC [33,34], only one of which focused on Aspergillus
detection in BAL. Our IAC was a truncated version of an
exogenous DNA template derived from the jellyfish aequorin gene previously used in PCR studies for the diagnosis
of cytomegalovirus disease [24]. Known amounts of IAC
template introduced in the multiplexed qPCR mastermix
enabled reliable quantification of inhibition in the
Aspergillus or extraction control qPCRs. Because the IAC
was added during the qPCR stage, it was unaffected by
other variables of the process (like DNA extraction) and
therefore it exclusively monitored inhibition in qPCR. In
addition, the multiplexed IAC amplified with primers and
probe independent from the target and its reaction kinetics were optimized such that it did not affect the analytical
sensitivity of the target qPCR assay (as confirmed by the
positive A. fumigatus standards in each experiment). The
IAC qPCR detected inhibition in 7.6% (11 out of 144) of
the BAL samples. Re-extraction of DNA eliminated PCR
inhibition in all samples without significant losses of
DNA. Therefore, the IAC ruled out qPCR inhibition as a
cause for FNs in this study. It is also noteworthy to mention that the IAC qPCR multiplexed with the Aspergillus
qPCR assay did not manifest any inhibition even in the
presence of human genomic DNA as high as 1.5 μg per
reaction. This implies that the IAC was monitoring for
qPCR inhibition independent of the large quantities of
human genomic DNA found in extracted BAL fluid.

tion threshold of fungal burden (e.g. femtograms of
DNA). This was useful in identifying the threshold of
detection with an optimal trade-off between diagnostic
sensitivity and specificity. The ROC analysis showed that
a detection threshold of 13 fg of Aspergillus DNA per pellet
generated a sensitivity and specificity of 76.9% and
87.7%, respectively (Fig. 2). These data compare favorably
to the sensitivity and specificity of both PCR and galactomannan antigen studies using BAL fluid published previously [10,12]. At this detection threshold and a prevalence
of proven or probable IPA of 13.8%, the NPV of Aspergillus
qPCR assay was high at 94% and the PPV was 58%, consistent with results from other studies using BAL to diagnose IPA [16]. In addition, the PPV of our qPCR was
similar to the FDA approved serum GM test used on
hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients [35,36]. The
lower PPV reflects the relatively low prevalence of IPA
when analyzed on a per episode basis. A high NPV is useful as it suggests that a patient is unlikely to have IPA if the
test is negative, and this may spare the patient from receiving unnecessary antifungal treatment that was started
empirically, though these results do not rule out infection
with another fungus.
Some patients (7) did not meet standard criteria for IPA,
but had consistently high levels of Aspergillus DNA in BAL
fluid by qPCR, as documented by repeated detection in
multiple qPCR assays performed on different days (Table
3). These cases may be false positives due to fungal colonization of the airways, fungal contamination at the time
of BAL collection, or true positives indicative of shortcomings in the EORTC/MSG criteria for defining IPA. Several
of these patients had a diagnosis of idiopathic pneumonia
syndrome or related pulmonary conditions after hematopoietic cell transplantation and were treated with
mould-active antifungal medications empirically, thus the
diagnosis of IPA cannot be completely excluded despite
the absence of formal criteria for IPA. On the other hand,
other patients did not receive mould-active antifungal
therapy and did not appear to develop sequelae of IPA

despite absence of treatment, suggesting that these episodes are definite false positives.
Among the 3 patients with false negative results, one had
no evidence of Aspergillus in the original BAL sample using
any diagnostic method, but proved to have IPA based on
a subsequent lung biopsy. This false negative sample had
the lowest amount of cellular material of all the BALs
processed in this study which may reflect inadequate sampling of the lung segment at the time of bronchoscopy
with BAL. Two patients with false negative PCRs for
Aspergillus had 1 CFU of Aspergillus detected in BAL fluid
by culture. This failure to detect Aspergillus DNA in the
BAL fluid from these 2 subjects may reflect the low burden
of fungal organisms, or may reflect the fact that these culture results are false positives (laboratory contamination),
leading to improper classification using EORTC/MSG criteria.
There are several limitations of our study. First, the BAL
procedure is highly variable which may impact the
amount of fungal cells sampled from the site of infection.
Second, significant portions of BAL were sent for other
microbiological tests like histology and culture. There
could be an impact of uneven distribution of fungi in the
BAL between aliquots submitted for these various tests. In
addition, the sensitivity of our study may have increased
if larger volumes of BAL were processed. Third, we do not
have serum or BAL galactomannan data for these subjects,
which limit our ability to compare PCR performance with
another molecular diagnostic test. Fourth, based on the
EORTC/MSG criteria, culture was primarily used as a gold
standard in defining IPA. This may have led to an overestimate of sensitivity and specificity of culture in our study.
In our study, quantitative PCR was about as sensitive as
culture or culture with histology combined (Table 2). In
contrast to culture, qPCR results can be generated in one
day. Although culture was equally sensitive in detecting
IPA in this study, it should be noted that this result probably reflects the critical role that cultivation played in

defining subjects with IPA using EORTC/MSG criteria in
this study. Several studies in the past have reported the
sensitivity of BAL culture to be relatively low (< 50%)
[4,7,8]. Of the 13 episodes with proven or probable IPA,
culture and Aspergillus qPCR (with a 13 fg detection
threshold) were concurrently positive for 8 episodes.
There were 2 episodes when culture was negative and
qPCR was positive and 3 episodes when culture was positive and qPCR negative. In addition, qPCR was always
positive when histology was positive. This implies that
when qPCR is conjunctively used with culture, sensitivity
of detecting IPA could approach 100%, though much
larger numbers of samples will be needed to define the
true sensitivity and specificity of the qPCR assay. The significant correlation of fungal burden estimated by qPCR
and the CFUs reported by culture tests implies qPCR is
highly likely to be positive when culture and/or histology
are positive. This result is in concordance with several
published studies [15,18,34,37].

Conclusion
Our Aspergillus qPCR assay detected Aspergillus DNA in
76.9% of subjects with proven or probable IPA when the
concentrated BAL fluid pellet fraction was used for diagnosis. There was no benefit from analyzing the BAL supernatant fraction. Use of both extraction and amplification
controls provided optimal quality control for interpreting
qPCR results. PCR inhibitors detected in samples by the
IAC could be removed with re-extraction of the DNA.
Some patients did not meet standard criteria for IPA, but
had consistently high levels of Aspergillus DNA in BAL
fluid by qPCR suggesting that the FPs may result from colonization of the airways or shortcomings of the MSG/
EORTC classification criteria. Future studies will involve
additional testing of BAL samples where the performance
of galactomannan antigen assay is also evaluated. The rigorous quality control steps incorporated in our qPCR
assay significantly enhance the reliability of the results
and therefore may increase our understanding of the true
potential of qPCR for the diagnosis of IPA.
