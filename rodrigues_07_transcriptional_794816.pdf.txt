Abstract
Background: The main vector for transmission of malaria in India is the Anopheles culicifacies
mosquito species, a naturally selected subgroup of which is completely refractory (R) to
transmission of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium vivax;
Results: Here, we report the molecular characterization of a serine protease (acsp30)-encoding
gene from A. culicifacies, which was expressed in high abundance in the refractory strain compared
to the susceptible (S) strain. The transcriptional upregulation of acsp30 upon Plasmodium challenge
in the refractory strain coincided with ookinete invasion of mosquito midgut. Gene organization
and primary sequence of acsp30 were identical in the R and S strains suggesting a divergent
regulatory status of acsp30 in these strains. To examine this further, the upstream regulatory
sequences of acsp30 were isolated, cloned and evaluated for the presence of promoter activity. The
702 bp upstream region of acsp30 from the two strains revealed sequence divergence. The
promoter activity measured by luciferase-based reporter assay was shown to be 1.5-fold higher in
the R strain than in the S. Gel shift experiments demonstrated a differential recruitment of nuclear
proteins to upstream sequences of acsp30 as well as a difference in the composition of nuclear
proteins in the two strains, both of which might contribute to the relative abundance of acsp30 in
the R strain;
Conclusion: The specific upregulation of acsp30 in the R strain only in response to Plasmodium
infection is suggestive of its role in contributing the refractory phenotype to the A. culicifacies
mosquito population.

Background
The Anopheles culicifacies mosquito is the main vector of
the human malaria parasite, P. vivax, in the Indian sub-

continent and is responsible for approximately 65% of
new malaria cases annually [1]. The natural transmission
cycle of Plasmodium parasite requires successful complePage 1 of 20

tion of a complex sporogonic cycle in the midgut and the
salivary glands of the Anopheles mosquito, a process that
takes place over a period of two weeks. This developmental cycle can be blocked by the innate immune responses
of the mosquito thereby resulting in the elimination of
pathogen in the vector itself [2].
Mosquito vectors differ in their efficiency of transmitting
malaria; some are refractory and completely block transmission of parasite [2]. Naturally evolved and genetically
selected refractory strains are important for the study of
mechanisms that mediate Plasmodium killing [3-5].
Genetically selected susceptible and refractory strains
(4Ar/r and L3-5, respectively) are described in African
mosquito Anopheles gambiae [3]. The R strain blocks parasite development by melanotically encapsulating the ookinetes after invasion of the midgut [6]. Understanding the
molecular basis of such refractory phenotypes may contribute to the development of novel strategies for malaria
control, which would rely on elimination of the parasite
in the mosquito itself.
Recently, Adak et al. (2006) reported the isolation of a naturally occurring field strain of A. culicifacies that is 100%
refractory to P. vivax and partially resistant to P. falciparum
and P. vinckei (rodent parasite) [7,8]. In the R strain,
brown capsular ookinetes characteristic of the melanization reaction were microscopically observed in the mosquito midgut within 24 hours of Plasmodium – infected
blood feeding. Normal uncoated ookinetes were observed
in the S strain indicating that strain refractoriness in A.
culicifacies could be attributed to melanotic encapsulation
of ookinetes. The melanotic capsule consists of a proteinaceous poly-quinone material surrounding the parasite
and killing of the parasite may be mediated by toxic
byproducts of the melanization cascade reactions, such as
free radicals or by starvation within the capsule [9,10].
The melanization reaction starts with a modulatory serine
protease cascade, leading to proteolytic cleavage and activation of prophenoloxidases (PPOs) to phenoloxidases
(POs), the key enzymes for melanin production [11,12].
In addition, serine proteases are also involved in signaling
and amplification cascades that lead to the activation of
specific defense mechanisms, such as melanization, coagulation and induction of anti-microbial peptides. An
increasing number of serine proteases involved in
immune responses have been isolated and characterized
from A. gambiae. The majority of these serine proteases are
present in the hemolymph and expressed by hemocytes.
In A. gambiae, CLIPB9, CLIPB4 and CLIPB1 serine proteases are induced during immune responses and have
sequences characteristic of prophenoloxidase activating
enzymes [13-17]. The role of several of these proteases in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/33

melanization and killing of parasites has been examined
by RNA interference [18-20].
In the present study, we report the isolation of a serine
protease (acsp30) from the body tissue of A. culicifacies.
Acsp30 was poorly transcribed in the S strain whereas
abundant transcript was observed in the R strain. Expression of acsp30 was constitutive in both the strains but was
strongly upregulated upon parasite invasion in the R
strain. Although, the nucleotide sequence of acsp30 cDNA
and genomic clone were identical in R and S strains, a significant sequence divergence of upstream regions was
observed. The promoter in R and S strains was localized
within -702 bp of the translation initiation site; quantification of promoter strength by the luciferase-based
reporter gene assay revealed a 1.5-fold higher activity in
the R strain compared to the S strain. Our studies suggest
divergent promoter sequences recruit differential transcription factors resulting in a varied expression of acsp30
in the R and S strains. In addition, differential distribution
of nuclear proteins in the two strains could also contribute
to disparity in acsp30 transcription.

Results
Cloning and analysis of acsp30 of A. culicifacies
A PCR-based strategy was employed to isolate the serine
protease-encoding gene (acsp30) from the body tissue
(thorax and abdomen) of A. culicifacies. The 816 bp fulllength cDNA encoded a 272 amino acid protein, ACSP30,
corresponding to molecular mass of approximately 30
kDa. Computer-assisted analysis revealed that the first 17
amino acids of ACSP30 constituted a signal peptide and
the next 19 form a propeptide. Mature ACSP30, 236
amino acids in length possessed structural elements characteristic of all serine proteases such as the conserved catalytic triad (HDS) and six cysteine residues (Fig. 1A).

By using the ClustalW alignment program (Mac Vector
version 7.0), the deduced amino acid sequence of ACSP30
was aligned with reported sequences from other insects.
ACSP30 showed highest sequence similarity (83%) with a

defense mechanisms in insects [18,19,23-26].
Differential expression of serine protease in R and S strains
The relative expression level of acsp30 transcript in fiveday old naïve adult female mosquitoes of the R and S phenotypes was analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig.
2A) and real-time PCR (Fig. 2B) using β-actin as an internal control. Though acsp30 was expressed constitutively in

the R and S strains, there was a significant difference in
their expression levels. In naïve adult female mosquitoes,
transcript levels of acsp30 were 40-fold higher in the R
strain compared to S. Acsp30 was expressed constitutively
during development of mosquito; a varying pattern of
expression was observed from second instar larvae to
pupa. A dramatic 300-fold increase in acsp30 transcript
was observed in the second instar larvae as compared to
the levels present in the adult mosquito (Fig. 2C).

(D) Temporal induction of acsp30 upon Plasmodium infection. Refractory mosquitoes were fed on uninfected blood (open bars) and on P. vinckei infected blood (shaded
bars) and transcript levels of acsp30 were measured by real-time PCR at different time intervals post-blood meal (PBM). For all
realtime RT-PCR experiments, RNA isolated from body tissue (abdomen and thorax) of mosquitoes was used as template and
expression levels of acsp30 were measured by using the Comparative CT Method. Transcript levels were normalized to the
internal control, β-actin and shown as fold induction relative to the naïve adult female mosquitoes. Representative data (mean ±
S.D.) from three independent experiments are shown.

Immune responses to Plasmodium infection
Both refractory and susceptible 4–6 day old adult female
mosquitoes were separately fed on blood of Balb/c mice
infected with Plasmodium vinckei petteri. The refractory A.
culicifacies mosquito strain is partially resistant to the
rodent malarial parasite [7]. Mosquitoes fed on blood of
uninfected mice were included as blood-fed controls.
Temporal expression of acsp30 was monitored by real-

time PCR at regular intervals after feeding (Fig. 2D). In the
R strain, a 68-fold increase in acsp30 transcript level was
observed 24 hours after feeding on uninfected blood.
Mosquitoes fed with infected blood exhibited a 300-fold
increase in the transcript levels over the naïve unfed
female mosquitoes. The 24 hour post-feeding upregulation of acsp30 expression coincided with microscopic
observation of encapsulated Plasmodium ookinetes in the

midgut of the R strain. In contrast, the expression levels of
the acsp30 remained unaltered upon feeding uninfected or
parasite-infected blood in the S strain (data not shown).
Structural analysis of acsp30 upstream regulatory
sequences from R and S strains
The cDNA corresponding to the acsp30 was cloned from
both R and S strains and sequenced. A comparison of the
two sequences did not reveal any difference between the

two strains. Since the cDNA sequence of acsp30 was identical in both the strains, we isolated the corresponding
genomic DNA using PCR. The 887 bp gDNA fragment was
slightly bigger than the cDNA indicating the presence of
an intron. Sequence analysis revealed that the gene has a
single intron of 71 bp at its 5' end and is a phase 0 intron.
Since the location and the sequence of the intron were
identical in both the strains, the upstream sequences of
acsp30 were isolated and evaluated for promoter activity.

Using a PCR-based directional genome walking protocol,
regions upstream to ascp30 were cloned from R and S
strains. Amplicons of 1.4 kb and 0.7 kb were obtained in
the R and S strains respectively. Upstream sequences (702
bases) from the R and S strains were aligned by ClustalW
using MacVector (Version 7.0) and EMBOSS-Align (Fig.
3). A high degree of sequence similarity (94.2%) was
observed up to 333 bp, upstream of the translational start
site (ATG). Beyond this region there was a considerable
divergence in the gene sequence. The region between -702
bp and -333 bp showed 54% similarity with 41.7% gaps
and only 30% similarity was observed in the region
between -702 bp and -500 bp with 65.8% gaps (Fig. 4).
In silico analysis of the upstream sequences of acsp30
revealed characteristics of RNA polymerase II-transcribed
promoters. Using the computer-based promoter prediction tool, two putative transcription start sites were predicted to be located at -31 bp (score cutoff of 1.0) and -40
bp (score cutoff of 0.8) upstream of ATG in R and S
strains. The region surrounding this transcription start
point corresponded to the arthropod initiator sequence,
which is found in the interval -10 to +10 of 25% of arthropod RNA polymerase II-transcribed promoters as
described by Cherbas and Cherbas (1993) [27]. This reinforced the prediction of this site as the true transcription
start site. In both strains, two TATA motifs were found at
position -53 and -189 from the ATG and two arthropod
transcription initiator motifs TCAGT [27] were present at
position -12 and -152. Using the consensus DCAKTY [27],
putative capsite was found at position -31 and -152
respectively in the R and S strains. These sites constituted
the putative core promoter elements (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6).

Regulatory sequence motifs in both the strains were
searched from within the insect family using the MatInspector Program [28] and 29 consensus matches were
detected in the S strain and 19 in the R strain, all of which
were based on factors present in Drosophila. In the S strain,
the 29 different matrices were well distributed along the
entire 702 bp upstream region but in the R strain such
motifs were absent in the region between -304 bp and 702 bp and the 19 matrices were restricted to the -1 to 303 bp region. A comparative analysis of putative binding
sites is depicted in Table 1.
The upstream regulatory sequences of the R and S strains
were also scanned for putative vertebrate regulatory elements. Several interesting motifs were found in these
regions. Computer-assisted analysis revealed motifs
which were homologous to the response elements for
transcription factors described in the promoters of other
insect immune-responsive genes and mammalian acutephase protein genes and are listed in Table 2[29]. Of the
several motifs listed, an interesting observation relates to
the two potential regulatory motifs for the ecdysone
responsive element (EcRE) (consensus RGKKSNNNGNNYK) [30]. In the R strain, EcRE are located at positions 199 to -211 bp (GGTTGAATGCGTT) and -5 to -17 bp
(AGTGGTCAGTACT) on the plus strand while only one
such motif was located in the S strain at a position identical to the R strain (-199 to -211 bp). At present, it is difficult to assess the consequences of these differences on the
refractory phenotype, a detailed mutational and deletion
analysis is necessary to study the significance of these
observations.

Functional analysis of the acsp30 promoter in R and S
strains
Based on the homology of upstream sequences of acsp30
between R and S strains, two regions were selected for
evaluating the promoter activity. The region spanning -1
to -333 bp showed 94% similarity and the other region
spanning -1 to -702 bp showed 72% similarity. These

regions from the R and S strains were cloned in promoterless pGL3-Basic vector containing firefly luciferase
reporter gene and transfected into Drosophila S2 cells. The
luciferase activity from all the four constructs was higher
than that of the vector (pGL3-Basic) and control (pGL3Control) suggesting that the upstream gene sequences
from R and S strains contain regulatory elements for their

respective promoters (Fig. 7). The two constructs pGL3Ref333 and pGL3-Sus333 yielded similar levels of luciferase activity, while pGL3-Ref702 from the R strain
showed 1.5-fold increase in luciferase activity compared
to the S strain.
Differential binding of nuclear proteins to acsp30
upstream sequences from R and S strains
The increase in promoter activity in the R strain was attributed to sequence differences within the 400 bp region
spanning -333 to -702 bp upstream of the start codon. To
determine the effect of such differences on the binding of
nuclear proteins, electrophoretic mobility shift assays
(EMSAs) were performed. EMSA experiments with three
different probes (400 bp, 188 bp and 100 bp) allowed us
to determine the minimum upstream region that shows
difference in binding of nuclear proteins and thus might
be responsible for differential expression of acsp30 in the
two strains. EMSAs using nuclear extracts from the R strain
and R400/S400 probe revealed two complexes, a sharp
slow migrating band, complex A and a faster moving diffused band, complex B (Fig. 8A, lane3). Both the com-

plexes were observed when R188 probe was incubated
with nuclear extract from R strain (Fig. 9, lane 3). Interestingly, formation of complex B was nearly abolished on
R100 probe but complex A formation remained unaffected (Fig. 10). These results clearly indicated that the 88
bases (-602 to -514 bp) missing in R100 probe were critical for the assembly of transcription factors forming complex B but the 100 bp upstream region (-702 to -602 bp)
was important and sufficient for binding of nuclear proteins forming complex A.
In general, the binding of nuclear proteins to probes
derived from the S strain was less compared to that from
the R strain, which further emphasized the importance of
differences in upstream regions of acsp30 from both the
strains. The greater intensity of the bands with the R
probes showed that the formation of both the complexes
was more on R probe than S; an approximately 25%
increase in DNA binding activity of both the complexes
was observed on R400 as compared to S400 probe.
Importantly, when S188 was used as a probe, there was an
approximately 50% reduction in the formation of com-

increase in sequence divergence (70%) in this region
between the two strains.
Specificity of interaction of nuclear proteins with various
probes from R and S strains was evaluated by competition
assays in the presence of corresponding specific cold
probe. The binding of nuclear factors to 400 bp upstream
sequence from R strain (R400) was highly specific as the
formation of complexes A and B was reduced to 25% in
presence of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled 400 bp
cold probe in the EMSA binding reaction mixture (Fig. 8).
Competition experiments with sequentially shorter fragments from R and S strains also generated similar results
showing the specificity of binding of nuclear factors to all
the probes (data not shown).

additional transcription factors in the R strain that could
be absent in the S strain. Noticeably, the binding pattern
of nuclear proteins from S strain to S188 and R188 probes
(Fig. 9) were different from that of nuclear proteins from
R strain. A similar result was obtained with S100 and
R100 probes (Fig. 10). When a nuclear extract from the S
strain was used with R100 probe, the faster migrating
band, complex B did not form. This is indicative of either
a lack of the transcription binding factors in the S strain
that form complex B or their low concentrations that prevent detection. The association of putative binding factors
was quantified by converting intensity of signals to
numerical values by using the Image Analysis Software,
ImageQuant TL (Amersham Biosciences) and the results
were presented as bars in figures, 5, 6 and 7.

Discussion
We also performed EMSA experiments using nuclear
extract from both the strains to evaluate the presence of

are responsible for strain survival and reproductive success. Genetic analyses of this strain have revealed that the

dium by melanotic encapsulation of ookinetes. The phenoloxidase cascade that is responsible for the
melanization event recruits serine protease to activate
prophenoloxidase, thereby leading to the formation of
phenoloxidase, tyrosine and quinones [12]. Serine proteases are reported to play a determinant role in triggering
melanotic encapsulation of parasites in many malariarefractory mosquito strains [5,18,31].
We focused our analysis on one of the early determinants
of encapsulation phenotype, serine proteases. A parasiteinducible serine protease-encoding gene (acsp30) was isolated from the body tissue of A. culicifacies. The deduced
protein, ACSP30, shared 30% or less sequence similarity
with serine proteases from other insects such as Drosophila, Chrysomia and Culex. These serine proteases are
reported to function mainly in dissolution of fibrin clots
or in embryonic development. Notably, ACSP30 did not
possess a CLIP domain and shared a very low sequence
homology (<15%) with Clip domain serine proteases that
are implicated in melanization of malaria parasites
[18,20,32]. It may represent a divergent class of hitherto
undescribed serine protease that plays a role in melanotic
encapsulation of the parasite.
Importantly, transcriptional analysis of acsp30 revealed
that it could play an important role in the mosquito
immunity. Real time analysis demonstrated that the levels
of acsp30 were 40-fold higher in the refractory strain as
compared to the susceptible strain even in the absence of
any challenge. The strain seems to have evolved the capacity to constitutively express high levels of serine protease,
which could serve as a molecular marker for differentiating R and S strains. The high transcript levels of acsp30 in
the R strain prompted us to further investigate its role
inresponse to parasite invasion. In this regard, timedependent experiments that involved feeding R and S
mosquitoes uninfected and Plasmodium-infected blood
were carried out. Expression levels of acsp30 were significantly increased upon un-infected blood feeding (68-fold
over the naïve unfed control) in the R strain but no such
induction was observed in the S strain, thereby making it
a strain-specific response. Upon feeding parasite-infected
blood, the transcription of acsp30 was further upregulated
(4.4-fold over the uninfected blood-fed control) suggesting that endogenous levels of the transcript were not sufficient to combat the invading parasite and an added
induction was required to block parasite development.
Noticeably, upregulation of acsp30 transcript levels 24
hours after parasite-infected blood feeding coincided well
with the appearance of melanotically encapsulated ookinetes in midgut of the R strain of A. culicifacies.
Both, time and high level of induction of acsp30 are suggestive of its role in PPO-mediated melanization cascade

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/33

triggered in response to Plasmodium. Importantly, the
transcript levels of acsp30 were unaffected when the nonmelanizing S strain was fed on Plasmodium-infected blood
(data not shown). This result further strengthened the
possibility of involvement of acsp30 in contributing
towards the refractory phenotype to the mosquito along
with other genes. Interestingly, when the R strain of A.
culicifacies was challenged with a gram-positive bacterium,
Micrococcus luteus (data not shown), the expression levels
of acsp30 were not affected, indicating that the induction
of acsp30 was a Plasmodium-specific response.
Recently, gene silencing of Clip domain serine proteases
by RNAi have revealed their involvement in killing of parasite and melanization of sephadex beads [18-20]. The
loss of refractory phenotype of the R strain mosquitoes
upon injection of dsRNA corresponding to acsp30 could
illuminate the specific role of ACSP30 in melanization.
The steps that lead from upregulation of acsp30 to encapsulation in the refractory strain are not clear at present. It
is possible that upregulation may be a postmelanotic
event facilitating clearance of parasite [20].
To understand the basis of differential expression of
acsp30 in the R and S strains, structural analysis of the gene
was carried out. Genomic DNA and cDNA sequences of
acsp30 from both strains were found to be identical,
including the presence of a 71 bp intron. Therefore, we
concluded that the coding and the non-coding regions of
the gene were not responsible for the observed differential
expression in the two strains. The upstream sequences of
the gene from both the strains were cloned, scanned and
evaluated for promoter activity using a promoterless, luciferase reporter vector. The promoter activity of the 333 bp
regions was nearly identical whereas 702 bp region from
the R strain yielded 1.5-fold higher luciferase activity than
the S strain. This observation suggested that the sequence
between -702 bp and -333 bp was responsible for the differences in promoter activity in R and S strains. Sequence
alignment of the 400 bp region (-333 to -702 bp) from
both strains revealed 54% similarity compared to 94%
similarity in the 333 bp region (-1 to -333 bp) thereby
providing support to above observation.
An in silico analysis of acsp30 upstream sequences was carried out using the MatInspector program. It is premature
to identify amongst the listed transcription factors any
correlative specifics for encapsulation, nevertheless, one
particular transcription factor that deserves special mention is Dorsal. It is mainly engaged in transcriptional activation of genes involved in dorsoventral patterning [33].
The mosquito orthologue of dorsal is Gambifl (REL1),
which has been shown to translocate to the nucleus following bacterial but not Plasmodium infection [34]. Inter-

estingly, this site was present in the upstream sequences of
acsp30 from susceptible but not from the refractory strain.
Several signature sequence motifs implicated in promoters of immune-responsive genes from A. gambiae and
Aedes aegypti [29,35-37] were also present within the
upstream sequences of acsp30. Notably, the consensus for
NF-κB, which is reported in Aedes [35] and A. gambiae [29]
defensin genes is absent in acsp30, suggesting that
defensin pathway-associated serine protease is different
from the phenoloxidase-associated serine protease. Interestingly, the A. gambiae PPO1 gene that codes for melanin-synthesizing enzyme prophenoloxidase is the first
mosquito immune gene reported to contain two ecdysteroid response elements (EcRE's) in its promoter sequence
[38]. Using reported consensus sequences, two putative
EcREs were located in acsp30 upstream sequences from
the R strain and one in the S strain [30]. The significance
of these differences and their eventual effect on refractoriness in A. culicifacies remains to be ascertained. A closer
look at the nucleotide composition of the upstream
sequences in the two strains revealed a very high G+C content in the R sequences and high A+T in the S sequences
which probably could influence the affinities or the
strength of the DNA-protein interactions.
EMSA experiments were carried out to further characterize
the upstream sequences of acsp30 from both strains.
Together with 400 bp, which showed higher promoter
activity in R strain, two more regions within (100 and 188
bp) were chosen for EMSA experiments. Nuclear proteins
from the R strain mosquitoes interacted with R400 probe
to form two complexes, larger complex A and smaller
complex B. The complex A appeared as a discrete band
whereas complex B was observed as a diffused band in the
agarose gel with greater intensity than complex A. This
could be due to greater affinity of complex B for the probe
than complex A or due to its higher abundance. The
sequence differences between R400 and S400 led to a
25% reduction in formation of both the complexes on
S400, showing an overall decrease in number of transcription factors binding the upstream sequences of acsp30 in
the S strain as compared to the R strain. Competition
binding experiments demonstrated that binding of
nuclear proteins for complex formation was highly specific. By using two deletion mutants of the 400 bp region,
we were able to narrow down the regions that were important for the assembly of both complexes.
The formation of complex A was seen even in the smallest,
100 bp region used for EMSA experiments but complex B
was completely abolished in this region and required an
additional 88 bases. Importantly, S strain nuclear extracts
lacked or had very low levels of transcription binding factors (TBF) forming complex B. Complex A formation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/33

remained unaffected on using nuclear extract from the S
strain, indicating that the nuclear proteins forming complex A were present in both the strains but, the sequence
difference between R and S upstream sequences was critical for its formation. On the other hand, formation of
complex B was sensitive to both the sequence and the
presence of transcription binding factors in the nuclear
extract. Identification and characterization of these TBFs
would be necessary to further evaluate the differences in
the two strains. The 2-D analysis of nuclear proteins from
S and R strains will probably reveal the identity of the
TBFs responsible for high level expression of acsp30 transcript and other genes contributing to the refractory phenotype.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this is the first report of an immuneresponsive serine protease from a field-collected refractory
strain of Anopheles culicifacies, the main vector of malaria
in India. Transcript abundance of acsp30 in naïve adult
refractory mosquitoes, even in the absence of any
immune challenge, suggests possibility of its contribution
towards refractory phenotype to A. culicifacies population.
Through a series of EMSA experiments and in silico analysis, we have tentatively identified potential regulatory
binding motifs that could be responsible for differential
expression of acsp30 in R and S strains of A. culicifacies.
Further analysis of factors responsible for conferring
refractory phenotype to mosquito against malaria parasite
may pave way towards identification of critical intervening steps to abort parasite development in mosquito.

Methods
Mosquito rearing
Cyclic colonies of S and R strains of malaria vector, Anopheles culicifacies, were reared in an insectary at National
Institute of Malaria Research, Delhi maintained at a temperature of 28 ± 1°C and 75 ± 5% relative humidity and
fitted with simulated dusk and dawn machine with a photoperiod of 14 hour day and 10 hour night as described by
Adak et al. (1999) [39].

Mosquitoes were fed upon 1% glucose soaked pads and
raisins. Female mosquitoes were offered rabbit blood for
ovarian development. Following hatching, larvae were
reared in enamel trays containing de-chlorinated water
and fed on powdered dog biscuits and brewer's yeast tablets in 3:2 ratios.
Cloning of ascp30 of A. culicifacies
Total RNA was isolated from the body tissue of refractory
population of A. culicifacies by the TRIZOL Reagent
method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, USA). To avoid contamination of the digestive
proteases, the gut was removed from the mosquitoes asep-

tically. Up to 5 μg total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis
using reverse transcriptase enzyme (Superscript II) and
adapter primer (AP, 5' GGC CAC GCG TCG ACT AGT ACT
TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT 3').
Degenerate primers, SerPr1 (5'-TGG GTC/G C/GTG ACC/
G GCC/G GCG/A/T/C CAC/T-3') and SerPr2 (5'-ACG
AGC/G CGA/G CCA/G CCC/G GAA/G TCG/A/T/C-3')
were designed based on the sequence of reported serine
protease in A. gambiae [21]. Using these degenerate primers and cDNA as template, a 450 bp fragment was amplified. The fragment was cloned into pGEM-Teasy vector
(Promega Corporation, USA) and sequenced by
Microsynth (Switzerland). On the basis of sequence of
cloned insert, a set of gene-specific primers, DSerPr1 (5'CGT GCA CTT GAA CAT TAT CTC-3') and DSerPr2
(5'CTG GTT GGC AGC GTC ACG A-3') were synthesized,
to obtain 5' and 3' ends of the gene respectively, by RACE
(rapid amplification of cDNA ends) according to the protocol described in the 5' and 3' RACE kit manuals (Invitrogen). Gene-specific end primers, 10FMOS (5'-ATG AAA
CTG TTC ATC GTC GT-3') and 11R (5'-TTC AGT ACT TGA
TGC CAG ATT-3') were designed and synthesized on the
basis of sequences of 5' and 3' RACE fragments to obtain
the full-length serine protease gene. Using these end primers and cDNA as template, a complete 816 bp gene
(ascp30) was isolated, cloned in pGEMT-easy vector and
sequenced. All the primers were synthesized from
Microsynth.
Dissections and RNA extractions
The mosquitoes were dissected on clean new slide in a
drop of ice-cold sterile DEPC-treated water and body tissue (abdomen and thorax) was collected by removing
midgut, heads, legs and wings. Body tissue from ten mosquitoes was pooled in 500 μl of TRIZOL. Mosquito larvae
of the different instars were also collected and stored in
TRIZOL at -70°C.

The tissues were ground to homogeneity with a batterydriven hand-held homogenizer using DEPC-treated sterile
grinder tips and processed for RNA extraction by TRIZOL
Reagent method. Contaminating DNA was removed by
treatment with RQ1 DNase (Promega Corporation)
according to manufacturer's instructions. The total RNA
isolated was used as a template for semi-quantitative and
real time RT-PCR analysis of acsp30 transcripts using βactin as internal control.
Blood feeding strategy
Rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium vinckei petteri 279BY,
supplied by Prof. Irene Landau, Museum National d'Historie Naturelle, Paris [41], was maintained on rodentmosquito cycle at the National Institute of Malaria
Research, Delhi [7]. Cryo-preserved Plasmodium vinckei

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/33

petteri infected blood isolates (500 μl) were mixed with an
equal volume of incomplete RPMI culture media and
were inoculated into healthy 4–5 weeks old Balb/c mice.
Thin blood smears prepared from peripheral blood of
infected mice were fixed in methanol and stained in JSB
stain [42]. The slides were examined under oil immersion
lens of compound microscope (Carl-Zeiss, Germany) for
the presence of various stages of parasite. Ideal time for
feeding was ascertained by periodically monitoring the
parasitemia of infected mice and looking for the presence
of at least 0.5% mature gametocytes. Four- to six-day old
mosquitoes were starved by depriving them of raisin and
glucose pads for nine hours. Approximately 100–200
starved mosquitoes were held in cages and gametocytepositive mouse was placed in the cage for 1 hour during
daytime for feeding. Subsequently, the full-fed mosquitoes were separated from unfed and partially-fed mosquitoes in a separate cloth cage labeled accordingly and were
maintained at 23–24°C temperature and 65–70% relative
humidity in the insectary. Mosquitoes were dissected after
6, 12, 18 and 24 hours of blood feeding and the tissues
were stored in TRIZOL at -70°C until analysis.
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis
The relative transcript abundance of acsp30 in naïve mosquitoes (S and R strains) was determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR using a One-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen
GmbH, Germany). The amount of RNA in both the tissues
was normalized to the β-actin gene. The sequences of the
primer pairs used for amplifying β-actin were β-actinFor
(5'-CAG ATC ATG TTT GAG ACC TTC AAC-3') and β-actinRev (5'-GA/C/TC CAT CTC C/TTG CTC GAA A/GTC-3').
Using the normalized amount of RNA as template, ascp30
transcript was amplified by using gene-specific primers,
forward 10F (5'-ATCAGTTACCAATCGATCTTGCC-3')
and reverse 4R (5'-CGTACGTTCCCATGCACTG-3') to
obtain a 500 bp amplicon. The amplification regimen was
as follows: reverse transcription at 48°C for 30 minutes,
inactivation at 95°C for 15 minutes and the PCR at 94°C
for 30 seconds, 52°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 30 seconds for 33 cycles followed by a final extension of 72°C
for 10 minutes. Before loading on 1% agarose gel, the RTPCR products were treated with 1 μg of RNase (Qiagen
GmbH) at 37°C for 10 minutes to eliminate template
RNA. The gel was photographed with Polaroid 667 black
and white print film.
Real Time RT-PCR analysis
Real time RT-PCR was performed using Quanti Tect SYBR
Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen GmbH) and iCycler TM system
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA) to measure relative transcript
levels of acsp30 in naïve R and S mosquitoes, in various
developmental stages of R strain mosquito and after
blood-feeding and parasite-feeding treatments. The
Primer 3 web-based tool was used to design gene-specific

primers, ensuring that the length of the PCR product was
300 bp. β-actin amplicon was obtained by using β-actinFor and β-actinRev primers and acsp30 amplicon was
obtained by using AcSp30For (5'-GTC AGA CCG CTG
GTG GTA AT-3') and AcSpRev (5'-CTC ACG GTT GAG
GAA CGT CT-3') primers. Each 25 μl reaction mixture
contained 2 μl of template RNA (100–500 ng/μl), 2×
QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Master Mix, 2 μl of primers (5 pmoles/μl), RNase-free water and 0.25 μl of QuantiTect RT enzyme Mix. Real-time cycler conditions
included a preliminary reverse transcription at 48°C for
30 minutes, an initial activation step at 95°C for 15 minutes and 40 cycles of denaturation (94°C), annealing
(52°C) and extension (72°C) for 30 seconds each. The
final step included gradual temperature increase from
50°C to 94°C at the rate of 1°C/10 seconds to enable
melt-curve data collection. A non-template control (NTC)
was run with every assay. The threshold cycles (CT) were
recorded for acsp30 and β-actin amplicons during each
experiment. Difference between the CT of β-actin and
acsp30 or ΔCT was determined and the relative abundance
of acsp30 was calculated in different treatments using
Comparative CT method using the formula 2-ΔΔCT [43].
Isolation of genomic clone of acsp30
Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from the body tissue
of R and S strains of mosquito by the method of Henry et
al., 1990 [40]. Using gDNA as template and end primers,
10FMOS and 11R, the genomic clones of acsp30 from
both strains were amplified by PCR. The obtained amplicons were cloned into pGEM-Teasy vector, sequenced by
ABI PRISM and a comparative analysis of the nucleotide
sequence from both strains was done using the ClustalW
(MacVector Version 7.0).
Isolation and cloning of upstream regulatory sequences
Three nested gene-specific reverse primers; R1 (Biotinylated) (5'-ACTACGAGGAGATTCACGCATGG-3'), R2
(5'-TTA TTCACACCTTGAGTTCAATTG-3') and R3 (5'GGCTAAAACGACGACGATGAACAG-3') were designed
from the 5' end of serine protease cDNA sequence. Using
50 ng of genomic DNA as template, PCR was performed
in four different tubes with four forward walker primers
(WP) [WP1, 5'-CTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGNNNNATGC-3';
WP2,
5'-CTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGNNNNGATC-3';
WP3,
5'CTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGNNNNTAGC-3'; WP4, 5'CTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGNNNNCTAG-3'] and the
reverse biotinylated primer, R1 according to the directional walking method described by Mishra et al., 2002
[44]. Amplified biotinylated products were then immobilized on streptavidin-linked paramagnetic beads and nonbiotinylated DNA was washed off. Nested PCR was carried
out using the above immobilized PCR product as template and gene-specific primer, R2 and T7-based forward

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/33

walker primer (5'-CTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3').
Amplified PCR products were cloned into pGEM-Te vector
and sequenced by Microsynth.
Forward primers containing the KpnI site were designed
and synthesized. They were located at 702 bp and 333 bp
upstream to the translational start site (ATG) at +1 position. These included; RefDelFor702, (5'-GGTACCCAATGACGCGTTAAGCC-3'),
RefDelFor333,
(5'GGTACCGATAAGAACGACCTGG-3') for the refractory
strain and SusDelFor702, (5'-GGTACCTCCTGATCAACTATAT-3'), SusDelFor333, (5'-GGTACCGATAAGAACGAC CTG G-3') for the susceptible strain. The reverse
primers were designed from a region just upstream to the
ATG and contained XhoI restriction site. These included,
RefSPRev, (5'-CTCGAGGATTAG TACTGACCACTACGG3') for the R strain and SusSPRev, (5'-CTCGAGGATTAGTACTGACCTCTACGG-3') for the S strain. Using the DNA
of the pGEM-Teasy clones as template and the above
primers, a 32 cycle PCR was carried out with the following
conditions; 94°C for 30 seconds, 52°C for 30 seconds
and 72°C for 1 minute with a final extension at 72°C for
5 minutes. PCR products were again cloned into pGEMTeasy vector. Plasmids prepared from the positive colonies were double digested with KpnI and XhoI. The fallout
was eluted from the gel using Qiagen gel extraction kit and
ligated into promoter-less luciferase reporter vector pGL3
Basic (Promega Corporation), which was pre-digested
with KpnI and XhoI enzymes. Resulting reporter plasmids
were named pGL3-Ref702, pGL3-Sus702, pGL3-Ref333
and pGL3-Sus333.
Computer-based sequence analysis
The upstream sequences of acsp30 isolated from R and S
strains were analyzed for potential transcription factor
binding sites using the MatInspector program [28]; matrix
library was set as Insect library, the core similarity at 0.75
and optimized matrix similarity was used for both the
strains. The upstream sequences for the two strains were
aligned using the ClustalW program (MacVector Version
7.0) and EMBOSS alignment programs. The core promoter elements and other vertebrate transcription binding factors were identified using reported consensus
sequences as described in the results.
Cell culture, transfections and luciferase assay
Drosophila S2 cells were obtained from Invitrogen and
were maintained at 27°C in Schneider's Drosophila
medium (Invitrogen) with 10% heat inactivated fetal
bovine serum in 25 cm2 cell culture flasks. One day before
transfection, S2 cells were seeded at 0.75 × 106 cells/ml in
24-well tissue culture plates to achieve 80% confluency.
DNA (1.5 μg) was transfected using cellfectin (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfection was carried out in serum-free medium for 8–12

BMC Molecular Biology 2007, 8:33

hours. The transfection medium was then replaced with
serum-containing medium and the cells were harvested
48 hours after transfection in 50 μl of 1× Cell Culture Lysis
Reagent. Luciferase activity was then measured using the
Luciferase assay system (Promega Corporation) and the
luminescence was read on a Packard LumiCount manual
luminometer. A pGL3-Control vector containing luciferase reporter under control of SV40 promoter served as
a control. Each transfection was repeated three times and
the luciferase activity was measured twice for each sample.
Preparation of nuclear extracts
Five-day old, adult female mosquitoes were dissected on a
clean slide in a drop of ice-cold sterile phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) pH 7.4 under a dissecting microscope. The
midgut, head, legs and wings were removed and the body
tissue of 100 to 200 mosquitoes from both R and S strains
were pooled and stored under liquid nitrogen until
required. The tissues were ground to homogeneity in a
minimum volume of PBS, with a battery-driven handheld homogenizer using sterile grinder tips and processed
for nuclear protein extraction according to the protocol of
Lin et al., (2004) [45] with minor modifications. Briefly,
homogenized tissue was solubilized in buffer A (10 mM
HEPES, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol,
0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM Na3VO4,
10% glycerol and 1 μg/ml of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin (pH 7.9) for 30 min at 4°C by gentle rocking on a
nutator and centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4°C for 1 min.
The supernatant containing the cytoplasmic proteins was
discarded and the pellet was then extracted with buffer B
(20 mM HEPES, 350 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA,
1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol,
1 μg/ml aprotinin, pepstatin and leupeptin, pH 7.9) at
4°C for one hour by gentle rocking on a nutator as
described above. The extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 ×
g at 4°C for 5 minutes and the supernatants (nuclear
extract) were snap frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -70°C
for subsequent use in EMSAs. All the protein concentrations were estimated by the method of Bradford (1976)
[46].
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
Primers were designed to encompass the 400 bp upstream
region (-702 to -302 bp) of acsp30 that was responsible for
difference in promoter strength in the two strains. Three
different fragments (100 bp, 188 bp and 400 bp) from
upstream regions of R and S strains were selected for
EMSAs. The DNA probes for EMSAs were prepared by
amplifying and radioactively labeling the fragments by
PCR in a 50 μl reaction mixture. The reaction consisted of
10 ng template (upstream regions from R and S), 10 pmol
of each primer, 100 μM dNTPs, 10 μl α-32P-dCTP (10
mCi/ml, 3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer, USA), and 2.5

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/33

units of Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech, USA). The PCR
included 32 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 94°C, 30 s
annealing at 52°C and 30 s extension at 72°C, followed
by a final extension of 5 min at 72°C. Labeled probes were
purified using a QIAquick nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen
GmbH) and the counts were checked by scintillation
counter (Beckman, USA).
The probes were named based on the size of the amplified
DNA fragment. In the R strain, R100 probe (-702 and -602
bp) was amplified using RefUp702For (5'-CAA TGA CGC
GTT AAG CCT GAT-3') and RefUp602Rev (5'-GAT CGC
CGT CGT CCA TCA ACA-3') primers; R188 probe (-702
and -514 bp) by RefUp702For and RefUp514Rev (5'-TTC
ATG TGG TTT CAT GAT TTA TTA-3') primers; R400 probe
(-702 and -302 bp) by RefUp702For and RefUp302Rev
(5'-CTT TCG AAT GAC GCC AGG T-3') primers. Similarly
for the S strain, S100 probe (-702 and -602 bp) was amplified using SusUp702For (5'-TCC TGA TCA ACT ATA TGG
GTT CCT-3') and SusUp602Rev (5'-CTA TTG AAA GAA
TCA ATT TGC TAA-3') primers; S188 probe (-702 and 514 bp) by SusUp702For and SusUp514Rev (5'-TTC ATA
TCT CAT CAT TTA TTA AAA ATT-3') primers; S400 probe
(-702 and -302 bp) by SusUp702For and SusUp302Rev
(5'-ATT TCG TAA TGA CGG CCA GGT-3') primers. EMSAs
were performed using 10 to 20 μg of nuclear extract from
either R or S and incubated at 37°C for 25 minutes with
32P-labeled probes (30,000 c.p.m. per reaction) and 2 μg
of poly (dI-dC) (Sigma). The binding buffer contained 20
mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA
(pH 8.0), 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 4% glycerol, in a final volume of 20 μl. For competition experiments, a 100-fold
molar excess of unlabeled probe was pre-incubated in the
reaction mixture at 37°C for 10 min before labeled probe
was added. The DNA-protein complex was resolved on a
2% agarose gel (pre-run for 1 h at 4°C) in 0.5× Tris-borate
EDTA (TBE) buffer at 200 V at 4°C. Gels were dried and
exposed for autoradiography. Scanning was performed
using the Typhoon 9210, Variable Mode Imager from
Amersham Biosciences, USA. The intensities of the signals
were quantified by the Image Analysis Software, ImageQuant TL (Amersham Biosciences) and represented as the
percentage ratio of S to R signal intensities. The accession
