Quasispeciesmutation spectramicro-evolution of dengue virus serotype 3dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)sequence diversityTaiwan

Abstract
Background: Previous studies presented the quasispecies spectrum of the envelope region of
dengue virus type 3 (DENV-3) from either clinical specimens or field-caught mosquitoes. However,
the extent of sequence variation among full genomic sequences of DENV within infected individuals
remains largely unknown.
Results: Instead of arbitrarily choosing one genomic region in this study, the full genomic
consensus sequences of six DENV-3 isolates were used to locate four genomic regions that had a
higher potential of sequence heterogeneity at capsid-premembrane (C-prM), envelope (E),
nonstructural protein 3 (NS3), and NS5. The extentof sequence heterogeneity revealed by clonal
sequencing was genomic region-dependent, whereas the NS3 and NS5 had lower sequence
heterogeneity than C-prM and E. Interestingly, the Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood
program (PAML) analysis supported that the domain III of E region, the most heterogeneous region
analyzed, was under the influence of positive selection.
Conclusion: This study confirmed previous reports that the most heterogeneous region of the
dengue viral genome resided at the envelope region, of which the domain III was under positive
selection pressure. Further studies will need to address the influence of these mutations on the
overall fitness in different hosts (i.e., mosquito and human) during dengue viral transmission.

Background
Dengue viruses (DENV), which consisted of four antigenically distinct serotypes (DENV-1, 2, 3 and 4), are the
most important arthropod-borne viruses affecting

humans. After infection, it may result in dengue fever
(DF), dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), dengue shock
syndrome (DSS) or death [1,2]. It is estimated that close
to 50–100 million cases of DF and 30,000 fatal cases of

DHF/DSS occur annually in tropical and subtropical
regions. With the increased numbers of dengue patients, it
is indicated the global expansion of epidemic areas, and
increased frequencies of severe DHF/DSS and case fatality
[3]. Considerable efforts have been devoted to developing
vaccines to prevent dengue, but the success of the vaccines
will be dependent on the vaccine strain chosen to direct
against the diversity and evolution of DENV genome.
DENV belongs to the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae,
possessing a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome,
which is approximately 10,700 bases in length and contains a single open reading frame [4]. A single polyprotein
translated from the viral RNA is cleaved into 3 structural
proteins [capsid (C), premembrane (prM) and envelope
(E) protein] and 7 nonstructural proteins (NS), with the
gene order as 5'-C-prM/M-E-NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4ANS4B-NS5-3'. Like many RNA viruses, the genomic
sequence of a single DENV isolate exists in nature as a collection of highly similar but not identical variants known
as quasispecies due to its high average mutation rate of 103 to 10-5substitution per nucleotide copied and per round
of replication [5,6]. Previous studies using a clonal
sequencing approach amplified viral RNA directly from
DENV-3 infected patients' plasma and the extent of
sequence heterogeneity in the envelope region with mean
pairwise difference ranging from 0.21 to 1.67% have been
observed [7]. There are obvious reasons for selecting the E
gene region for this study, mainly due to its important
biological functions such as receptor-mediated endocytosis, virus-induced cellular tropism and eliciting neutralization antibodies. However, one cannot exclude the
biological significance of the sequence heterogeneity in
other genomic regions including non-structural (NS) proteins, 5' and/or 3' non-coding regions (NCR). The wellstudied example of hepatitis C virus (HCV) demonstrated
that the quasispecies dynamics and composition of the
NS5A region may play a role in disease prognosis and in
response to interferon and ribavirin therapy [8]. Although
the previous attempt to correlate the sequence heterogeneity of the capsid gene with NS protein 2B gene region of
DENV-3 has observed very similar sequence heterogeneity
with mean pairwise p-distance 0.12–1.2% [9], the extent
of sequence variation among full genomic sequences of
DENV within infected individuals remains largely
unknown. Thus, it is important to address whether the
evidence of different evolutionary processes, such as adaptive evolution, shape the population genetics of DENV at
specific genomic regions other than the E region.
An outbreak of DHF, attributed to genotype 2 of DENV-3,
resulted in 111 DF and 23 DHF cases in Tainan (southern
Taiwan) from October 1998 to January of 1999 [10].
DENV-3 was the only serotype isolated during this outbreak, and the seroepidemological study clearly demon-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/72

strated that DHF cases were not associated with secondary
DENV infection [10]. Here we report the selection of the
most prominent variable regions identified by the fullgenomic sequencing of DENV isolates from six clinical
patients during this outbreak. The application of the
clonal sequencing of those variable regions enabled us to
study quasispecies structure of DENV isolates and to provide a better understanding of the changes in mutation
spectrum at the clonal level and virus evolution.

Results
Heterogeneous regions identified at full genomic scale of
DENV-3
To identify the potential heterogeneous regions of DENV3 in the whole-genomic scale, acute-phase plasma samples were obtained from six dengue patients, including
three DF (designated 1F, 2F and 3F) and three DHF
patients (designated 1H, 2H and 3H). The sequencing
strategy is depicted in Fig 1. These patients' plasma samples were used to infect the C6/36 mosquito cell line to
obtain sufficient viral genomic RNA for full-genomic consensus sequencing for the identification of regions with
sequence heterogeneity for follow-up clonal sequencing.

The consensus sequence similarity of these six viruses was
as high as 99.73%. The 2H and 3H virus each had two
silent changes at nucleotide positions of 808 (G to A),
9979 (T to C), 4204 (C to T) and 8785 (T to C), respectively (Table 1). There were no consistent nucleotide
changes that might correlate with disease severity among
paired viruses using this consensus sequencing approach.
However, the potential heterogeneous sequence regions
were clearly observed and identified by close examination
of the overlapping chromatogram files using the SeqMan
program in the Lasergene software package (DNASTAR
inc., Madison, WI). Special attention was paid to identify
the regions which consistently presented mixed-chromatographic peaks in the respective trace files obtained from
at least two independent sequencing primers. These
potential heterogeneous regions, located at C/PrM, E, NS3
and NS5 genes (Table 1), were selected for the clonal
sequencing analysis. Five genomic fragments were amplified directly from six patients' viremic plasma by five
flanking primer pairs (Table 4) at nucleotide position of
1–764 (5'NCR/C/prM), 1259–2550 (E/NS1), 5443–6337
(NS3) and 8501–10316 (NS5/3'NCR) using Titan™ one
tube RT-PCR System (Boehringer Mannheim). After
excluding the primer sequences, the C/PrM region was
752 nucleotides in length with 225 amino acids in the
coding region; the E/NS1 region was 1239 nucleotides in
length covering 413 amino acids which included 40
amino acids at the N terminal end of NS1 protein, the NS3
region was 866 nucleotides in length covering 288 amino
acids, and the NS5 region was 1791 nucleotides in length
with 586 amino acids in viral coding sequences.

Clonal sequencing of the heterogeneous regions among
dengue viral genomes
The pCRII-TOPO™ T/A cloning kit (Invitrogen, San Diego,
CA) was used to clone PCR products representing heterogeneous sequence regions identified by the consensus
sequencing as described previously [7]. At least 20 to 30
clones containing the PCR amplicons from four heterogeneous gene regions (C-PrM, E, NS3 and NS5) were
sequenced, aligned, and analyzed using the program GCG
and MEGA v3.0 [11]. In general, the transitional substitutions were higher than transversional substitutions for all

samples analyzed. The transitional changes (A to G or T to
C) constituted overall substitution rate of 72.8 ± 5.1%,
73.7 ± 11% at C/PrM, E of structural proteins, and the NS3
and NS5 regions had relatively lower such changes of 63.2
± 7.5%, 44.7 ± 18%. The lowest nucleotide mutation frequencies were observed in NS3 region with a mean ±
standard deviation (SD) of 0.6 ± 0.3 × 10-3 for all clones
analyzed, followed by C/PrM (1.2 ± 0.15 × 10-3), NS5 (1.5
± 0.4 × 10-3) and envelope region (1.8 ± 0.8 × 10-3), which
was statistically significant (p < 0.01). Similarly, the substitution frequencies of amino acids were also variable
among the viral genome regions with the lowest frequency observed in NS3 (1.3 ± 0.4 × 10-3), followed by C/
PrM (2.3 ± 0.3 × 10-3), E (3.1 ± 1.8 × 10-3) and NS5 region
(3.3 ± 0.8 × 10-3) (Table 2).
The mean pairwise p-distance as described in the previous
study [7] was employed to compare the extent of sequence
variation among different viral genome regions. Consistently, NS3 had the lowest pairwise p-distance among NS5,
C/PrM or E protein. The average mean p-distance in nucleotides and SD for NS3, C-PrM, NS5, and E were 1.4 ± 0.6
× 10-3, 2.3 ± 0.3 × 10-3, 3.1 ± 0.9 × 10-3, and 3.7 ± 0.7 × 103, respectively. At the amino acid level, NS3 also had the
lowest mean p-distance (3 ± 1.4 × 10-3) and E proteins had
the highest variability (6 ± 1.2 × 10-3) (Table 2). The difference of mean p-distance in nucleotides or amino acids
among different genes was statistically significant (p <
0.01). No consistent correlation between any two different genes from the same human isolates with the extent of
the nucleotide heterogeneity could be made. This would
suggest that different genes are governed by different
mutation rates, which resulted in different sequence (quasispecies) spaces/sizes in different gene regions.
Different selection pressures on different domains of E
gene of DENV-3
Our previous analysis of the E gene of DENV-3 covered
only 131 amino acids [7]. The PCR amplification by
primer pair p1259A and cdc2503B in this study covered
1239 nucleotides encoding 413 amino acids, including
portion of domain I and II, 3 hinge regions, and complete
domain III to the end of the stem-anchor region [12].
However, genetic instability was observed when the PCR
product was cloned into the T/A vector and propagated in
E. coli. The genetic truncation occurred consistently at the
location following amino acid position 412 of the envelope gene (E412). This truncation was observed in 29
clones (21.5%) out of 135 clones sequenced. In order to
increase the sample size and to investigate the extent of
amino acid substitution in the E protein, the deduced
amino acid sequences of all 135 clonally obtained
sequences from patients' viremic plasma were aligned and
trimmed so that it contained 293 amino acids, ranging
from E118 to E412, which include portions of domain I

and II, the complete domain III and a portion of stemanchor region for analysis (Table 3). Consistently, there
was a higher mean amino acid p-distance in dengue hemorrhagic patients (1H: 0.008 ± 0.002, 2H: 0.012 ± 0.002,
3H: 0.009 ± 0.002) than in dengue fever patients (1F:
0.006 ± 0.001, 2F: 0.007 ± 0.002, 3F: 0.007 ± 0.001) with
statistical significance (p < 0.05).
Since the E protein is the major determinant of viral entry,
cellular tropism and the target of both humoral and cellular immune selection [13,14], amino acid changes associated with particular site changes were further investigated
using Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood program (PMAL) [15]. The non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitution ratio, referred to as parameter
omega (ω) in the model, was calculated with the
CODEML program from the PAML package, which analyzed and compared the ω ratios codon-by-codon using
the maximum likelihood ratio test among three domains
[16]. In this study, the M3 model of codon evolution was
used since it often provides the best evidence for positive
selection. Although some variations were observed, in
general, domains III and I were influenced by positive
selection as indicated by the dN/dS ratio larger than 1, but
domain II was influenced by neutral selection, as the dN/
dS ratio was smaller than 1. The average value of dN/dS was
the highest in Domain III (21.52), followed by Domain I
(2.45), then Domain II (0.92) (Table 3).
Phylogenetic analysis of DEN-3 Virus
To determine the evolutionary history of the DENV-3
viruses found in Taiwan in 1998, the nucleotide sequence
of their partial E protein genes were compared with those
from all previous published DENV-3 E gene sequence
available in the GenBank. The phylogenetic tree analysis
for 141 clonal sequences from six virus isolates of this
study and 24 global DENV-3 sequences separated the

viruses into five main subgroups, which had been previously defined as five different genotypes. As in previous
studies of DENV-3 diversity, the 1963 Puerto Rico strain
formed a distinct outlier, which served as the outgroup for
the phylogenetic tree. The tree topology was very similar
based on either neighbor-joining (NJ) or parsimony
(PAR) method. Based on the phylogenetic tree, the virus
isolates from Taiwan in 1998 formed a tight cluster with
strong bootstrap support, which fell closer to the isolates
from Thailand as they belong to DEN-3 genotype II,
according to the classification of Lanciotti et al (20)(Fig
2). Most of the population from the clonal sequences
formed a tightly cluster, which represented the highly
homogeneous nucleotide sequences during the same epidemic. Interestingly, some clones from different individual isolates appeared to form the different subgroups
under the Thailand genotype, with 50–100% bootstrap
support. This indicated viral evolution did occur during
the epidemic period, probably under selection pressure.

Discussion and Conclusion
To the best of our knowledge, this was the first systematic
attempt to understand the sequence spectrum of the entire
genome of DENV-3. Previous studies, focused on certain
genomic regions such as the envelope gene, the capsid
gene or the NS2B gene, have revealed the presence of quasispecies structure as indicated by the simultaneous presence of multiple variant genomic sequences of the dengue
virus isolates from either the clinical samples or fieldcaught mosquitoes [7,9,17-19]. Instead of arbitrarily
choosing one genomic region in this study, the full
genomic consensus sequences of six DENV-3 isolates were
used to locate the four most prominent heterogeneous
regions, the C/PrM and E in the structure, and NS3 and
NS5 in the nonstructural regions.

Use of clonal sequencing to study the mutation spectrum
needs to ensure that sequencing artifacts due to RT-PCR
amplification are reduced to minimum. In this study, we
used viral RNAs extracted from patients' viremic plasma
directly. In addition, a thermostable polymerase with
proof-reading function was incorporated in the RT-PCR,
which has been shown to be a simple and valuable
method for characterization of mutant spectra of virus
quasispecies [20]. The nucleotide changes from four
sequenced-viral genomic regions (range of 4.4–11.6 × 105 changes/nucleotide/cycle of PCR) were greater than
those predicted based on reverse transcriptase (10-4) and
proof-reading DNA polymerase (Pfu, 10-6 error/site/cycle)
combined [21]. Based on the experimental data, Arias et
al pointed out that the biological and molecular clones
were statistically indistinguishable when defining the
mutation spectrum with regard to the types and distributions of mutations, mutational hot-spots and mutation
frequencies [20]. Similarly, we believe that the fullgenomic characterization followed by clonal sequencing
procedure employed in this study is a reasonable and
justifiable approach for the characterization of mutation
spectra (quasispecies dynamic) of DENV-3 viruses.
DENV, like other RNA viruses, exists as quasispecies with
the sequence diversity of the envelope gene in the DENV3 virus population from 6 clinical isolates, ranging from
0.22–0.39% of mean p-distances in this study. These val-

ues are within the range calculated by other studies (0.12
to 0.84%) for different portions of the E protein genes of
DENV-3 viruses from either the clinical or field-caught
mosquito isolates [7,9,17-19]. Our study confirmed use
of the structural protein, especially the E gene with higher
sequence heterogeneity to study the viral quasispecies,
instead of NS protein and 5' and 3' NCR. The extent of
sequence variation observed in this study was similar to or
lower than what has been reported for acute infection of
HIV-1 or HCV [8,22-25]. A study of sequence variation of
HIV-1 after sexual transmission revealed that the nucleotide mean diversity of the E gene (gp120) was 0.24% and
that of the gag gene (p17) was 0.5% [22]. Similar results
by studying variants of hepatitis C virus (HCV) from a single infected blood donor and 13 viraemic recipients were
traced to examine the sequence diversity in hypervariable
region 1 with sequence p-distance ranged from 0.3% to
6.2% [23]. These data might support an important concept in the evolution of arthropod-borne RNA viruses
(arboviruses) which evolve more slowly than RNA viruses
transmitted by other routes due to intrinsic constraints
associated with dual replication in mammalian and invertebrate hosts [26]. Consistent with this interpretation was
that the lower sequence diversity was observed at the same
E protein gene from the field-caught mosquito DENV-3
isolates [19] or after inoculation of clinical serum of
DENV-3 into mosquitoes (data not shown).

The larger mutation spectra in structural proteins than
non-structural proteins probably imply less genetic constraint on the structure proteins to maintain proper function than non-structural proteins. However, the
mutations in the structural or non-structural proteins did
not accumulate randomly during replication. The mutation rates vary in different functional/structural domains.
Even within the envelope structure protein, where
domain III, the proposed receptor-binding and neutralizing antibody-binding sites [13] had highest sequence
heterogeneity than Domain I or II. The detail analysis in
our study further indicated that the different selection
pressure was exerted on different domain of the E gene of
DENV-3. Domain III and domain I were under the influence of positive selection (dN/dS:21.52, 2.45) and domain
II was under the influence of neutral selection (dN/
dS:0.92). The particularly higher dN/dS ratio in domain III
of viral isolates 3H was caused by the value of 0 of dS at the
denominator. The positive selection on the domain III is
not surprising since domain III contains the receptorbinding domain and major type-specific neutralization
epitopes [12]. However, the complete E gene sequence
may be required to clarify the evolutionary selection on
domain I and II due to incomplete sequence obtained in
this study.
In contrast to other studies which suggested the strong
purifying selection in the E gene of dengue virus evolution, the consensus sequences used for analysis represented dengue viral gene conservation during long-term
evolution [27]. The clonal sequences obtained from our
study represented the selection pressure imposed on viral
populations during the short term of evolution, which
might explain the substantially different dN/dS value
within hosts and among genotypes. The majority of the
nonsynonymous mutations that arise within each host
occurred as singletons with relatively low frequency in the
population; thus are likely to be deleterious. Such heterogeneous gene pool may give rise to various viruses able to
occupy new ecological niches or to adapt to sudden selection pressures on the cycle of replication. It is evident that
certain nonsynonymous nucleotide mutations at specific
sites repeatedly occurred among different virus isolates as
well as after mosquito inoculation in our study (data not
shown), which has been proposed as quasispecies memory in another study [28]. Further studies are needed to
address the influence of these mutations on the overall fitness in different hosts (i.e., mosquito and human) during
dengue viral transmission.

Materials and methods
Study subjects and virus isolation
Six dengue patients were identified by RT-PCR to be
DENV-3 positive during the 1998 epidemic and their
acute-phase viremic plasma samples were collected within

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/72

seven days following the onset of fever. These plasma
samples were used to infect C6/36 Aedes albopictus mosquito cell lines as described previously [29]. The study
protocol was approved by the College of Public Health
Research Ethics Review Committee at the National Taiwan University with the informed consent obtained from
six dengue patients. Six adult dengue cases between 38
and 63 years of age, including one DF (F) and one DHF
(H) cases, whose disease status were classified based on
WHO criteria [30], were represented as 1F, 1H, 2F, 2H, 3F
and 3H, respectively.
DENV-3 was confirmed by indirect immuno-fluorescent
antibody (IFA) tests using serotype-specific monoclonal
antibodies (DENV-1:H47, DENV-2:H46, DENV-3:H49,
DENV-4:H48) [31]. The C6/36-passage one viral stock
was used for full genomic consensus sequencing to identify regions with sequence heterogeneity for clonal
sequencing as described later.
Preparation of viral RNA, RT-PCR amplification and
consensus sequencing of PCR products
Viral RNA was extracted either from viremic plasma specimens or from the C6/36-passaged one cell culture fluids
using QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) by
following the manufacturer's protocol. The eluted RNA
was used as the template and overlapping regions of
DENV-3 genome amplified by Titan™ one tube RT-PCR
System (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) following the
manufacturer's suggestions. The oligonucleotide primer
pairs were designed based on published full-length
DENV-3 sequence data for the strains of H87 and 80-2
(GenBank Accession number M93130 and AF317645)
and the unpublished DENV-3 sequences (Chang, G-J. personal communication). Ten overlapping fragments were
generated which spanned genomic regions of DENV-3 at
the following nucleotide (nt) positions: 1 to 1199, 540 to
1712, 1259 to 2521, 2171 to 3435, 3142 to 4697, 4124 to
5708, 5443 to 7497, 7246 to 8770, 8501 to 10335, 9991
to 10709. Primer sequences used for PCR amplification
were summarized in Table 4. The obtained PCR products
were sequenced by using the Big Dye Terminator Sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA) and analyzed by the 3100 automate sequencer (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems) with a short capillary.
Preparation of plasmid templates for clonal sequencing
We used pCRII-TOPO™ T/A cloning kit (Invitrogen, San
Diego, CA) to clone PCR products representing heterogeneity sequence regions identified by the consensus
sequencing protocol at the previous section. The T/A vector ligated PCR product was used to transform Escherichia
coli TOP10 competent cells (Invitrogen) and at least 30
white colonies were picked, to grow in 3 ml LB broth at
37°C overnight. Plasmid DNAs were extracted by the

Virology Journal 2005, 2:72

QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen), and each plasmid
DNA with the desired inserts was completely sequenced
using insert flanking primers, T7 and cSP6.
Nucleotide and Amino acid sequence analysis
Overlapping chromatogram files retrieved from the automate sequencer were analyzed and edited using the SeqMan program in the Lasergene software package
(DNASTAR inc., Madison, WI). The derived consensus
sequences after excluding the sequences of amplifying
primers were aligned using GCG package (Genetic Computer Group, WI). For full-length genomic sequences we
paid special attention to identify the regions which consistently presented mixed-chromatographic peaks in the
trace file obtained from at least two independent sequencing primers. These regions were selected for the follow-up
clonal sequence analysis. Pairwise comparisons of both
nucleotide and amino acid sequences between isolates
and clonal sequences were performed using the program
MEGA v3.0 (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis,
Pennsylvania State University, PA) to determine the numbers of transition and transversion changes, and the mean
and proportion of difference, Hamming distance and pdistance, as described previously [8,32,33]. Synonymous
(dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) distances relative to the
consensus sequences were calculated within each isolate
by maximum likelihood ratio method in the CODEML
program from the PAML package [15]. Instead of assuming that all sites are under the same selection pressure with
the same underlying dN/dS ratio, it allows variable selection intensity to vary among amino acid sites [34,35]. In
this study, M3 model of codon evolution was applied for
which often provides the best evidence for positive selection [16]. An excess of nonsynonymous substitutions over
synonymous substitutions (ie. the ratio of dN/dS > 1) is an
indicator of positive natural selection at the molecular
level.

The results were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). T-tests were performed on two-sampled tests
and a one-way ANOVA was performed to compare data
from different genomic regions, family clusters or
different domains in envelope region. In all tests, a pvalue less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Evolutionary analysis
The nucleotide sequences generated in this study were
combined with those of all other DENV-3 E protein gene
sequences available on GenBank, which resulted in a total
data set of 154 sequences. Phylogenetic trees were estimated using parsimony method available in the Phylip
v3.6 package [36]. Bootstrap resampling analysis of 500
replicates was generated with the SEQBOOT program to
prove the stability of the trees. Phylogenetic trees were

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/72

delineated using the TreeView (v.1.6.6) program by using
Puerto Rico 1963 isolate as the outgroup. For better presentation of the phylogenetic tree, only 30 clonal
sequences from six different clinical isolates and 24 global
isolates were shown in Fig 2.
Nucleotide sequences accession numbers
The sequences from four heterogeneous regions of dengue
viruses from the six patients studied here have all been
submitted to GenBank, and their accession numbers are
from DQ109039 to DQ109173 for the E region, from
DQ109174 to DQ109305 for the capsid/prM region,
from DQ109306 to DQ109405 for the NS5 region and
from DQ109406 to DQ109524 for the NS3 region.
