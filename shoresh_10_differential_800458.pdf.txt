Differential expression of maize chitinases in the
presence or absence of Trichoderma harzianum
strain T22 and indications of a novel exoendo-heterodimeric chitinase activity
Research article

Abstract
Background: The interaction of plants with endophytic symbiotic fungi in the genus Trichoderma alters the plant
proteome and transcriptome and results in enhanced plant growth and resistance to diseases. In a previous study, we
identified the numerous chitinolytic enzyme families and individual enzymes in maize which are implicated in plant
disease resistance and other plant responses.
Results: We examined the differential expression of the entire suite of chitinolytic enzymes in maize plants in the
presence and absence of T. harzianum. Expression of these enzymes revealed a band of chitinolytic enzyme activity
that had greater mass than any known chitinase. This study reports the characterization of this large protein. It was
found to be a heretofore undiscovered heterodimer between an exo- and an endo-enzyme, and the endo portion
differed between plants colonized with T. harzianum and those grown in its absence and between shoots and roots.
The heterodimeric enzymes from shoots in the presence and absence of T. harzianum were purified and characterized.
The dimeric enzyme from Trichoderma-inoculated plants had higher specific activity and greater ability to inhibit
fungal growth than those from control plants. The activity of specific chitinolytic enzymes was higher in plants grown
from Trichoderma treated seeds than in control plants.
Conclusions: This is the first report of a dimer between endo- and exochitinase. The endochitinase component of the
dimer changed post Trichoderma inoculation. The dimer originating from Trichoderma inoculated plants had a higher
antifungal activity than the comparable enzyme from control plants.
Background
Trichoderma spp. are opportunistic root colonizing fungal plant symbionts [1] that induce numerous changes in
plant gene expression and physiology. Among the phenotypic changes are increased systemic resistance to plant
diseases [1-8]; increased growth of plants and roots,
including an increase in fertilizer use efficiency and
uptake [9-12]; and a generalized increase in resistance to
abiotic stresses [1,13].
We recently completed an analysis of the proteome of
maize plants in the presence or absence of T. harzianum
strain T22 [11,14]. Even though T22 was present only on

roots, there were 141 proteins that we identified as upregulated and 50 that were down-regulated in shoots [11],
while in roots 20 up-regulated and 11 down-regulated
proteins were found [14]. A large portion of the up-regulated proteins were involved in carbohydrate metabolism,
while a number of others were involved in photosynthesis
or resistance to stress. In addition, starch accumulation in
maize plants whose roots were colonized with T22 was
greater than in the control [11]. We suggested that
Trichoderma induces both increased growth, which is
mediated by an increase in photosynthetic and respiratory rates, and systemic induced resistance [14].
In an earlier study we determined that maize root colonization enhanced expression of chitinolytic enzyme
activity [15]. This is frequently assumed to be part of
induced systemic resistance [8]. However, in our pro-

teomic studies, we did not identify up- or down-regulation of chitinolytic enzymes, probably primarily because
we examined proteins with isoelectric points between 5.3
and 7.5, and the pIs of most chitinolytic enzymes are
more basic or acidic than these levels. Prior to a recent
study [16], only seven endochitinases and four partial
sequences of exochitinases were identified. Using a combination of in silico and expression analyses, we identified
putative 27 endochitinase genes (glycosyl hydrolases families 18 and 19) and four exochitinases (GH20; β-Nacetylhexosaminidases). The full sequences of these
genes, domain analyses, and, in many cases, chromosomal locations were identified for these genes [16].
The chitinolytic enzyme families in plants and
microbes are quite complex. They may cleave the chitin
or other substrate molecules randomly or a single residue
from the non-reducing end of the chitin molecule. These
two types are commonly referred to as chitinases (endoβ-N-acetylglucosaminidase; EC 3.2.1.14) and exochitinases (β-N-acetylhexosaminidase; EC. 3.2.1.52). To
avoid confusion, hereafter we will refer to the EC 3.2.1.14
enzymes as endochitinases and the 3.2.1.52 proteins as
exochitinases, and any protein with enzymatic activity
against chitin as a chitinolytic enzyme [17].
Given the great diversity of chitinolytic enzymes in
plants, it is not very useful to simply quantify total chitinolytic enzyme activity as a quantitative measure of
induced resistance or other factors. The total activity
probably indicates little regarding the specific functionality of any individual gene product. In terms of disease
resistance, as measured by antifungal activity, the differences between exo- and endo enzymes is quite large. In
general, endochitinases have greater activity than exochitinases but mixtures of fungal endo and exo-acting
enzymes usually are synergistic, and on a per unit protein
basis, a combination of exo and endo enzymes usually are
several-fold more active than any single enzyme [18,19].
In the course of our expression analyses of chitinolytic
enzymes in maize with and without T22, we noted a chitinolytic enzyme band with a mass substantially larger
than any expected gene product of the 31 different genes
we identified in maize. This protein is a heterodimeric
enzyme composed of an exo- and an endo-acting
enzyme. Such heterodimers have not been heretofore
described, and they may be of substantial importance
since the heterodimeric enzyme would be expected to
have substantially greater antifungal activity than any single protein. Moreover, the endo portion of the heterodimer differs in plants grown in the presence and in the
absence of T22.
This paper describes the characterization of the differential expression of chitinolytic enzymes in maize with
and without T22, the isolation of the heterodimeric

enzyme from T22-treated and untreated plants and
describes its very high antifungal activity.

Results
Chitin degrading enzymes of maize are different in shoots
and roots and in the presence and absence of T. harzianum

Maize chitinolytic enzymes obtained from roots and
shoots of plants grown from seeds treated or not treated
with T. harzianum strain T22 were tested for activity in
gels. Without boiling, five different activity bands were
observed in shoots and two on roots. After boiling, the
activity bands in shoots decreased to three, and the pattern changed in roots (Fig. 1). In both shoots and roots,
activity of almost all bands was higher in the presence
than in the absence of T. harzianum (activity of chitinolytic enzymes can readily be restored after boiling, as
has long been known [20]). The only exception is band #5
which did not differ significantly between the two treatments (Fig. 1C and 1D). Activity band patterns observed
in shoots were different from those observed in roots on
the SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 1A, B). Bands observed in gels
exposed to the methylumbelliferyl substrates changed
over time of incubation. Some activity bands of shoots
appeared as early as 2 min after incubation while others
appeared only later. After 30 min incubation the clarity of
the earlier bands decreased due to diffusion of the fluorescent product (Fig. 1A). Bands #2, #3 and #4 (55 kDa,
43 kDa and 30 kDa, respectively) were observed as early
as 2 min after incubation with the substrates. The rest of
the bands appeared after 15 min of incubation. But bands
#3 and #4 diffused by the end of 30 min incubation (Fig.
1A). Band #1 at the size of 95 kDa and band #5 at the size
of 25 kDa appeared in the protein samples processed at
55°C but failed to appear when protein extracts of shoots
were boiled before loading.
In roots, activity bands were observed to be 95 kDa and
23 kDa in both control and Trichoderma-treated plants in
samples that were heated only to 55°C (Fig. 1B). However,
no known chitinolytic enzymes have a molecular weight
as large as 95 kDa. After boiling, only one activity band
was observed at ca. 30 kDa. This suggested the possibility
that the 95 kDa chitinolytic activity band is a complex of
proteins.
Quantitative analysis of the fluorescence was performed using NIH-image software. Three independent
repeats were performed and equal loading was used in
each lane. In addition three major bands in each lane
were quantified in the Coomassie stained images. These
were used to verify equal loading and as a normalizing
reference. In most cases the level of chitinolytic activity
was 2- to 5-fold higher in plants grown from T22 treated
seeds than from control seeds (Fig. 1C and 1D).

Figure 1 Comparison of chitinase activity banding patterns of proteins extracts from control plants (C) and Trichoderma-inoculated (T)
plants. As described in the materials and methods, polyacrylamide gels with equal loading in each lane were removed from the glass plates following
electrophoresis, subjected to various washes, and stained for chitinase activities using methylumbelliferyl substrates that were dissolved in 100 mM
acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 1% low melting agarose. Chitinase activity bands from shoots (A) and roots (B) are shown. Activity bands started to
appear as early as 2 min after beginning of incubation. Different intensities were observed for the activity bands in control and Trichoderma-inoculated
plants, as shown in (C) -shoots and (D) -roots. The bands observed were numbered: 1-5 in shoots and 6-8 in roots; Bands intensities were measured
and compared between the two treatments. Molecular size markers: 106, 93, 52, 32, 28, and 18 kDa.

Identification of chitinolytic enzymes

Thin slices of the activity bands were cut out of the gel
and proteins were identified using LC/MS/MS. Massspectrometry results were screened against green-plant
database into which the sequences of the maize chitinolytic enzymes identified in our previous study were
incorporated [16]. Chitinolytic enzymes were identified
in 10 bands at a confidence level higher than 95% (Table
1, for Enzyme nomenclature of these chitinolytic
enzymes see Additional file 1). In band #6 of roots from
T22 treated plants, Exo2 was identified at only 90% confidence. The parallel band from control plants also contained this enzyme (at a confidence level of 96%)

suggesting that the identification of band #6 of root from
Trichoderma-inoculated plants was correct.
Exo2 was the only protein identified in all tissues and
treatments examined. ChiIVA and ChiIVB were identified only in shoots of control plants. ChiIII9675 and
ChiI11654 were identified only in shoots from Trichoderma treated plants. ChiI67336 was identified in shoots
of both control plants and those grown from seeds
treated with T. harzianum. ChiIII9615 was identified in
roots of both control plants and Trichoderma inoculated
plants.

Bands harboring chitinase activity were cut from gels and sent for identification by LC/MS/MS. The plant treatment and the tissues from which
the proteins were extracted are listed. The proteins were either heated to 55°C or boiled before loading on gel. The numbers of the bands
match the activity bands marked in Figure 1. The chitinases identified and the level of confidence is listed (when two proteins identified their
% of confidence is listed respectively). The amino acid sequences, binding domains and other information for each of the proteins is described

lier. The LC/MS/MS data indicated that this band contained two enzymes; an endochitinase with a mass of a ca.
30 kDa and the other was Exo2 with a mass of 66 kDa
(Table 1). This suggested that the protein in this band
could be a heterodimer between Exo2 and an endochitinase. The endochitinase in this putative dimer differed
according to the source of the tissue--the enzyme identified in shoots in the presence (ChiIII9675) and absence
(ChiIVA) of T22 was different and it differed again
between roots (ChiIII9615) and shoots of control plants
(Table 1).

Purification of the heterodimeric proteins from shoots

Proteins were isolated from shoots of control and Trichoderma-colonized plants and then were further separated
into 20 fractions according to their pI using a Rotofor
apparatus (Bio-Rad). Protein concentrations and chitinolytic activities were determined in each fraction and
expressed as fluorescence per milligram protein using
only MUA and MUB separately (Fig. 2A, B). In control
samples only the third and fourth fractions contained
activities on both MUA and MUB. In samples from plants
colonized with T. harzianum, the fourth and fifth frac-

tions contained enzymes that acted on both substrates.
The combined activities in both types of tissues were in
fractions at pH 6.2. The fourth fractions derived from
control and Trichoderma-treated plants, which had the
highest activity, were further analyzed.
The fractions indicated above were then separated on
native PAGE gels. In-gel activity assays demonstrated a
strong activity band in both control and Trichodermatreated samples (Fig. 2C, Activity panel). SDS- PAGE gels
of a sample from the fourth fractions revealed a number
of protein bands (Fig. 2C, Fraction panel). The activity
bands from the fourth fraction of the two treatments
were cut out and extracted from the native gel. Portions
of these extracted proteins were further run on SDSPAGE gels and found to give a single band at the size of 95
kDa after silver staining (Fig. 2C, Dimer panel, 55°C
lanes). The electrophoretically homogenous proteins thus
obtained were then used for subsequent assays of enzymatic and antifungal activities, and are described as the
purified heterodimeric proteins hereafter. The fold purification of the dimeric protein was tested using MUA and
MUB. The MUB based specific activity increased 302and 482-fold over the course of the purification for
enzymes from the control and Trichoderma-treated
plants, respectively (Table 2). The MUA based specific
activity contained within the dimeric protein increased
2.8- and 5.1-fold in the control and Trichoderma-treated
plants, respectively. The specific activities, based on the
two substrates, of the purified heterodimer isolated from
Trichoderma-treated plants were almost two-fold higher
than the activity of the protein from control plants (Table
2).
In order to dissociate the dimers to their components
the isolated dimers were boiled for 10 min in the presence
of a reducing agent (50 mM TCEP·HCl). While boiling
completely abolished activity, it did not completely dissociate the dimers into their components under these conditions. However, faint bands were observed at the sizes
of 65 kDa and 30 kDa which are at the expected sizes of
the exochitinase and the endochitinase identified by the
LC/MS/MS from these 95 kDa proteins (Fig. 2C, Dimer
panel, boiled). It is also worth noticing that the intensities
of the dissociated bands were stronger for the dimer
derived from control plants than the dimer derived from
Trichoderma-treated plants. This may suggest that under
these conditions dissociation of the control dimer is easier.

Discussion
Chitinolytic enzymes in plants are numerous and highly
diverse, including those in maize. The enzymes are
arranged in various classes and into endo- and exo-acting
enzymes based on domain analyses and sequence motifs.
The classification of enzymes in Table 1 and in this paper
is based on this sequence information; we recently have
described the maize chitinolytic enzymes and published
the sequences of the 27 endochitinases and four exochitinases from maize [16]. This study demonstrates that
root colonization by T. harzianum not only results in
changes in shoot and root chitinolytic enzyme activity
levels as we have described earlier [15] but that qualita-

tive changes also are induced. These data suggest that the
chitinolytic enzymes in maize are under complex regulatory control and that T. harzianum induces changes in
this regulation. Previous study has demonstrated that in
our system Trichoderma is present only on roots [15].
Thus, observed changes in proteins in shoots are a consequence of systemic induction by T. harzianum, which has
been noted in other studies as well [2,6,8,11,21,22]. Probably our assessment of the presence or absence of various
chitinolytic enzymes is an underestimate, since we were
able to identify only 10 of the activity bands.
There are so many chitinolytic enzymes, probably many
with unknown physiological function, and therefore
determination of total activity is not very useful. In many

antifungal activity of the purified heterodimeric proteins
in a model system utilizing P. digitatum. Both dimeric
proteins inhibited spore germination (Fig. 3). However,
the IC50 of the dimer from Trichoderma treated plants
was 14.74 nM while the IC50 of the dimer from control
plants was 38.95 nM. In addition to inhibition of spore
germination, in the presence of 52.36 nM of dimer (from
both control and T. harzianum treated plants) and at
21.05 nM and 10.53 nM of only the T. harzianum treated
plants derived dimer, we observed degradation of the
fungal cell walls in specific spots of some spores as well as
fusion of spores, which suggests that they had been primarily converted to protoplasts (mostly seen in the
Trichoderma treatment-derived dimeric protein) (Fig. 4B,
E-G). At lower concentrations of both dimers, other
abnormal structures were observed, such as swelling of
the hyphal tips and branching of the very end of the
hyphal tips. This relates to the weakening of the cell wall
since the tip is more sensitive to cell wall degradation.

studies, only changes in total chitinolytic activity were
measured [8,15]. In other cases, one, or at most a few, of
the enzymes that may be produced in plant systems were
studied [23-25]. A few studies have been more comprehensive; for example, a study on sugar cane pathogenesis
examined four chitinases [26] and a study in rice examined distribution, structure, organ-specific expression
and phylogenetic analysis of 12 chitinase III enzymes
[27]. However, so far as we can ascertain, there are no
fully comprehensive studies on the role of the total mixture of chitinolytic enzymes or genes in any plant process.
Two endochitinases, which were identified in the activity bands in this study, were previously shown to have

antifungal properties [28]. Chitinolytic enzymes are no
doubt important in pathogenesis [28,29,31-33]. Overexpression, or high level expression of heterologous chitinolytic enzymes, alone or in combination with other
antifungal proteins frequently results in protection
against pathogens [19,34-40]. The enhanced protection
by the chitinases could be due to direct inhibition of fungal growth or due to induction of plant defense responses
by the GlcNAc oligomers generated by their activity [41].
However, in other studies modulation of chitinase expression did not change the resistance of plants pathogens
[42,43]. This suggests that chitinases may also have other
roles (as demonstrated by [44,46-50]). Hence total activity of chitinases does not necessarily represent antifungal
activity and a study of specific chitinases could greatly
contribute to our understanding of their role.
Several Trichoderma strains induce the Induced Systemic Resistance (ISR) pathway [4,6] and others are suspected to induce the systemic acquired resistance (SAR)
pathway [51]. These data suggest that different pathways
of induced resistance may be activated by the presence of
different strains. Expression profiles may be more complex when adding effects of pathogens in plants colonized
or not colonized by Trichoderma. In cucumber, very different responses were identified in plants infected with
the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. lachrymans after root colonization by T. asperellum [8] than
with the biocontrol agent alone. Thus, altered profiles of
the complex mixture of chitinolytic enzymes are likely to
be discovered by different combinations of Trichoderma
strains and pathogens. It appears to be a very good system to examine the total potential of plants to express
induced resistance and changes in chitinolytic enzymes
can provide good markers for these differential
responses.
In the course of the current research, we found an
activity band with chitinolytic activity that was larger
than the protein that would be expressed by any gene that
we had identified. The molecular range of all identified
maize chitinolytic enzymes is 55-66 kDa for exochitinases
and 16-35 kDa for endochitinases. This indicated that
none of these could be the sole constituent of this high
molecular weight band. To our surprise LC/MS/MS identified an exochitinase, Exo2, together with different endochitinases, depending on the treatment and tissue type.
The mass of this 95 kDa protein was equal to the sum of
the exo- and endo-chitinases detected by LC/MS/MS and
the activity of this band disappeared upon boiling. These
data suggested that the 95 kDa protein was, in fact, a heterologous dimer between an exochitinase (Exo2) and an
endochitinase (ChiIII9675 or ChiIVA, in the shoot). An
exochitinase purified from mungbean was shown to exist
in a hetero-dimeric form with an unknown protein [52].
Thus, we have identified novel heretofore unknown het-

erodimer comprised of an exochitinase and an endochitinase. Although the dimers were identified in vitro from
plant extracts we hypothesize they may have an in vivo
significance, for example, in plant defense.
We were intrigued by the appearance of the different
endochitinase constituents in the dimer in the presence
or absence of T. harzianum and their possible role in
plant defense, especially since endochitinases and exochitinases were shown to possess synergistic antifungal
activity in mixtures [19,34]. Since the specific chitinolytic
activity of the dimeric protein in Trichoderma-treated
plants is higher than from control plants, this suggested
that the dimer from treated plants might possess higher
antifungal activity. This was confirmed since the purified
enzyme from shoots of Trichoderma-treated plants was
about twice as effective in preventing germination of fungal conidia as was the corresponding protein from control plants. Similarly, lower concentrations of the
Trichoderma-derived enzymes were required to cause
obvious cell wall damage in germlings of Penicillium digitatum. There are no reports on ChiIII9675, which is one
of the components of the Trichoderma-induced heterodimer, but the monomeric maize ChiIVA has antifungal
activity [28]. There has been a great deal of interest in
producing disease-resistant transgenic plants that express
chitinases. For example, Trichoderma chitinases, when
introduced transgenically into plants, induce resistance
against a range of plant pathogenic fungi [19,34,35].
Although tested here only against one fungal model system further study of the dimers activity against other fungal pathogens is under way. Yet, the genes encoding these
maize enzymes would appear to be good candidates for
such uses since they are derived from a food plant, and
therefore may be more acceptable than ones from microbial sources. The mechanisms by which Trichoderma spp.
induce plants to be more resistant to disease is just now
being understood. It could be that the change in chitinase
activity profile and the formation of dimers with higher
activity are part of this mechanism. It is likely, but
unknown, whether these dimers exist in other plants. The
in vivo role of these dimeric chitinase proteins in inducing resistance in plants to fungal attack deserves further
attention.

Conclusions
Using chitinase activity assays and gel-based proteomic
approach we characterized the differential expression of
the entire suite of chitinolytic enzymes in shoots and
roots of maize plants in the presence and absence of T.
harzianum. We further isolated heretofore undiscovered
heterodimeric proteins which include an endo- and
exochitinase constituents. Change of the endochitinase
component of the dimer resulted in change of the enzymatic activity.

Materials and methods
Plant and fungal material

Seeds of maize (Zea mays L.) inbred Mo17 were treated
with Trichoderma harzianum Rifai strain 22 (T22) in a
cellulose-dextran formulation (1-2 × 109 cfu/g) [53] or
were treated with water. Previous work with application
of the cellulose-dextran powder without T22 gave no
observable difference than water application (data not
shown). The cellulose-Trichoderma powder was suspended in water (38.5 mg/5 ml) and 100 μl were applied
to 5g of seeds. Seeds were planted in sandy loam field soil
in boxes (10.5 × 10.5 × 6 cm) with five seeds per box. Seed
treatments with T22 result in colonized roots, but the
organism does not grow on or in shoots [15]. Boxes were
incubated in a growth chamber with diurnal fluorescent
lighting with 16 h/8 h (light/dark cycle), at 22 ± 4°C, and
watered as needed. Seven-day-old seedlings were harvested: the shoots were first measured for heights and
then excised 1 cm above soil level, frozen immediately in
liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C until use.
Protein extraction

Shoot tissue samples were ground with liquid nitrogen
followed by further grinding in 9 ml of ice cold 0.1 M
HEPES and 2% dithiothreitol (DTT) per 3 g tissue powder using an Ultra-Turrax homogenizer (Janke & Kunkel).
Two repeats with a total of about 10 g shoot tissue each
were processed for each treatment. For ca. 10 g of control
plants, 55 plants were used. For Trichoderma-treated
plants, 40 plants were used to get ca. 10 g of tissue. The
homogenate was then centrifuged for 20 min at 15000 pm
at 4°C. Proteins were precipitated from the supernatant
by adding 8 volumes of ice-cold acetone and incubating
16 h at -20°C. After another centrifugation the precipitated proteins were washed twice with 2 ml of ice-cold
acetone followed by drying under a flow of N2. Powder
was than dissolved in sample solubilization buffer (100
mM sodium acetate pH5.5, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM DTT).
A small aliquot was diluted 50-fold with water and the
protein content was determined using Coomassie Plus
Protein Assay (Pierce) according to manufacturer's
instructions.
PAGE and in-gel chitinase activity assay

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
was employed to assess the relative amounts and banding
patterns of the chitinases in protein samples. Protein
samples were mixed with 25% by volume of loading dye
(15% sucrose; 2.5% SDS; 125 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7; 0.01%
Bromo-phenol Blue), loaded on a 4% acrylamide stacking
gel and separated in a 12% acrylamide gel using a Mighty
Small II electrophoresis system (Amersham). Gels were
then used for in-gel chitinase activity or stained with
Coomassie or silver stain using standard procedures.

Shoresh and Harman BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:136
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/136

Basic-native PAGE (native-PAGE) was used to isolate
the protein from the piece of gel harboring the chitinase
activity assay. Protein samples were mixed with 1/5 of
loading dye (100 mM of Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 50% glycerol;
0.01% Bromo-phenol Blue) and were loaded on a 4%
acrylamide stacking gel with 50 mM of Tris (pH 6.8) and
separated using a 10% acrylamide gel with 360 mM of
Tris-HCl (pH 8.9). The running buffer contained 50 mM
Tris-Base and 380 mM glycine, pH 8.9. Proteins were separated for about 5 h at a constant 30 mA/gel with cooling.
Before the in-gel chitinase activity assay, native gels
were washed with acetate buffer (100 mM, pH 5.0) for 20
min. SDS-gels were washed three times in renaturation
buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0; 2 mM EDTA; 1% casein)
for 30 min per wash and then washed for 20 min in 100
mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) with 1% (v/v) purified
Triton-X100. This was followed by two washes with 100
mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) for 15 min each. Similar procedures have long been used to renaturate chitinolytic enzymes following treatments appropriate for SDSPAGE gels (Trudel and Asselin, 1989).
Gels were then stained for chitinase activity by overlaying with 1% low melting (≤35°C gelling temperature) agarose that contained methylumbelliferyl substrate in 100
mM acetate buffer (pH 5.0). Substrates used were 4methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminide (MUA;
20 ng/ml), 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-D-N, N', N"triacetylchitotrioside (MUB; 16.6 ng/ml), 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-D-N, N'-diacetylchitobioside (MUC;
10 ng/ml) and 4-methylumbelliferyl N-acetyl-β-D-N, N',
N"N'''-tetraacetylchitotetraoside (MUD; 10 ng/ml)
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Agarose was melted in a microwave oven and kept in a water bath at 37°C and substrates
were added prior to application. Gels were kept at room
temperature and the activity bands were observed after 2,
15 and 30 min under UV light. Following photo imaging
of chitinase activity banding patterns, the agarose layer
was gently removed from gel and gels were rinsed in
deionized water and stained for protein profiles by coomassie or silver staining using standard procedures.
For dissociation of dimers, tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP·HCl) was added to a final concentration of
50 mM with the sample buffer and protein samples were
boiled for 10 min before loading on the gel.
Rotofor separation

Proteins were separated according to their pI using a
Rotofor Cell (Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer's
instructions. Before separation proteins were dissolved in
2% ampholyte (Bio-Lyte 5/8, Bio-Rad) and 1% purified
Triton X-100. Twenty fractions were collected and the pH
of each fraction was recorded. Proteins were precipitated
with addition of 8 volumes of cold acetone and incubated
16 h at -20°C. After 20 min of centrifugation at 15000

Page 9 of 11

rpm at 4°C, pellets were washed twice with cold acetone
and dissolved in 250 μl of 100 mM sodium acetate (pH
5.0). Three μl were diluted 1:10 in water and the dilutions
were used to measure protein concentration and chitinase activity (in 96-well plates).
Chitinolytic enzyme activity assay in plates

Chitinolytic activities were quantified in 96-well plates.
In each well 10 μl of BSA, 30 μl of tested sample (at the
desired dilution) and 30 μl of substrate (0.2 mM of either
MUA or MUB) were added, keeping the plate on ice. The
plate was then covered, sealed in a plastic bag and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped with
30 μl of 1 M sodium carbonate and the fluorescence was
determined at 360/460 (excitation/emission) with a CytoFluor II fluorescence multiwell plate reader. Fluorescence
of known concentrations of 4-methylumbeliferone
(Sigma) was used to plot a standard curve to determine
the activity of the chitinase in samples tested. The activity
was defined as micromolar methylumbeliferone released
per min per microgram of protein.
Extraction of proteins from acrylamide gels

Activity bands were cut out of the native gels (care was
taken to obtain pieces that were as narrow as possible).
Gel bands were mashed through a nylon mesh (SpectraMesh poly; Spectrum Medical Industries, Los Angeles,
CA). After addition of 100 μl water, the gel was left overnight at 4°C with occasional mixing. Mashed gels were
loaded on glass fiber columns (3 mm height) and centrifuged at maximum for 5 min. The eluted protein was
transferred to a new tube and 50 μl of water were added
to the column. After incubation of 1 h at room temperature, centrifugation was repeated.
Mass-spectrometry analysis and protein identification

Proteins were identified by peptide sequencing using
nanospray ion-trap tandem mass spectrometry (nESI-IT
MS/MS). The nESI-IT MS/MS experiments were performed on an LC Packings (Dionex)/4000 Q Trap
(Applied Biosystems) in positive ion mode. Protein identification was carried out using the PMF - GPS Explorer,
ESI - Analyst (Applied Biosystems) software. Non-redundant NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information, W) and SwissProt (European Bioinformatics
Institute, Heidelberg, Germany) databases as well as our
local chitinase sequences database were used for the
search. Searches were performed in the full range of Mr
and pI. Positive identification was considered only for
C.I.% of ≥95%.
Antifungal activity

Antifungal assays were conducted in 96-well plates using
a standard assay [54]. Each well contained a spore suspension of Penicillium digitatum (1000 spores per well)

Shoresh and Harman BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:136

and purified dimer at different concentrations in a final
volume of 30 μl in 1/3 strength PDB (potato dextrose
broth, Difco). Extraction from an empty gel was performed and this solution was added in place of enzyme
solutions for the control. The microplates were incubated
for 16-18 h at 25°C. Observations following incubation
were taken directly from the microplate wells under a
Nikon Diaphot brightfield microscope (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY, U.S.A.). The percentage of conidia germinated
was determined based on a screen focused to the center
of the well. Microscope slides were also prepared for
observation at higher levels of magnification. Abnormal
mycelial growth and morphological anomalies such as
branching, bursting, appearance of necrotic zones, and
lysis of the hyphal tips were recorded and photographed.
The assay was repeated independently on two separate
days.
