Replication of avian, human and swine influenza
viruses in porcine respiratory explants and
association with sialic acid distribution

Abstract
Background: Throughout the history of human influenza pandemics, pigs have been considered the most likely
“mixing vessel” for reassortment between human and avian influenza viruses (AIVs). However, the replication
efficiencies of influenza viruses from various hosts, as well as the expression of sialic acid (Sia) receptor variants in
the entire porcine respiratory tract have never been studied in detail. Therefore, we established porcine nasal,
tracheal, bronchial and lung explants, which cover the entire porcine respiratory tract with maximal similarity to the
in vivo situation. Subsequently, we assessed virus yields of three porcine, two human and six AIVs in these explants.
Since our results on virus replication were in disagreement with the previously reported presence of putative avian
virus receptors in the trachea, we additionally studied the distribution of sialic acid receptors by means of lectin
histochemistry. Human (Siaa2-6Gal) and avian virus receptors (Siaa2-3Gal) were identified with Sambucus Nigra and
Maackia amurensis lectins respectively.
Results: Compared to swine and human influenza viruses, replication of the AIVs was limited in all cultures but
most strikingly in nasal and tracheal explants. Results of virus titrations were confirmed by quantification of infected
cells using immunohistochemistry. By lectin histochemistry we found moderate to abundant expression of the
human-like virus receptors in all explant systems but minimal binding of the lectins that identify avian-like
receptors, especially in the nasal, tracheal and bronchial epithelium.
Conclusions: The species barrier that restricts the transmission of influenza viruses from one host to another
remains preserved in our porcine respiratory explants. Therefore this system offers a valuable alternative to study
virus and/or host properties required for adaptation or reassortment of influenza viruses. Our results indicate that,
based on the expression of Sia receptors alone, the pig is unlikely to be a more appropriate mixing vessel for
influenza viruses than humans. We conclude that too little is known on the exact mechanism and on predisposing
factors for reassortment to assess the true role of the pig in the emergence of novel influenza viruses.

Background
Pigs are important natural hosts for influenza A viruses,
which are a major cause of acute respiratory disease.
Influenza viruses of H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2 subtypes
are enzootic in swine populations worldwide. Most of
these swine influenza viruses are the product of genetic
reassortment between viruses of human and/or avian
and/or swine origin and their phylogeny and evolution
are complex [1-3]. The swine influenza viruses circulating in Europe have a different origin and antigenic

constellation than their counterparts in North America
or Asia and within one region multiple lineages of a
given subtype can be present [4,5]. Although natural
infections of pigs with avian [6-10] or human influenza
viruses [11,12] also occur, these viruses were rarely capable of establishing themselves as a stable lineage in pigs
without undergoing genetic adaptation [13].
Because sialic acids (Sia) with a2,6 and a2,3 linkages
to galactose (receptors preferred by human and avian
influenza viruses respectively) were identified in the
porcine trachea, pigs have been implicated as intermediate hosts or as mixing vessels for reassortment
[14-16]. As such, co-infection with human and AIVs

or with human, swine and AIVs could lead to the
emergence of new influenza viruses with a pandemic
potential. On the other hand, the generation of pandemic influenza viruses in pigs appears to be a rare
and complex process, and the 2009 H1N1 influenza
virus is the first pandemic virus that is almost certainly
of swine origin.
Though experimental in vivo studies [17-21] have confirmed the susceptibility of pigs to both avian and
human influenza viruses, they also point towards a
strong species barrier as virus titers obtained from the
respiratory tract and from nasal swabs were invariably
lower for the heterologous viruses than for typical swine
influenza viruses. In addition, all AIVs examined failed
to transmit between pigs [22,23]. Limited in vitro studies, using either porcine tracheal organ cultures [24] or
primary swine respiratory epithelial cell cultures
(SRECs) [25] confirmed the lower susceptibility of the
pig tissues to most heterologous viruses. In the SRECs,
Busch and co-workers identified molecular differences
in the HA gene which correlated with the divergence in
infectivity.
However, the replication efficiencies of influenza
viruses from various hosts as well as the expression of
Sia receptor variants have never been compared at all
levels of the porcine respiratory tract. For this purpose,
we (1) established porcine nasal, tracheal, bronchial and
lung explants covering the entire porcine respiratory
tract with maximal similarity to the in vivo situation, (2)
investigated the replication ability of avian, human and
swine influenza viruses in all relevant parts of the
respiratory tract and (3) analyzed the receptor distribution by means of lectin histochemistry.

hours post culture (hpc) are shown in Table 1. Every
result was the mean of 12 counts. The percentage of
necrotic and apoptotic cells generally remained below
5% for NE and TE and below 10% for bronchial explants
(BE) and lung explants (LE) during the entire period.
There were only two exceptions: the TE at 24 hpc and
the LE at 96 hpc.
Overall, it was concluded that the fluctuations of virus
yields over time were a true reflection of virus replication since the proportion of dead cells in the explants
showed little variation until at least 72 hpc.
2. Virus yield

All swine, human and avian isolates yielded infectious
virus in the four explant systems. As shown in Figure 1,
virus titers in the supernatant were significantly higher
at 24 than at 1 hpi. The virus titers of Chicken/Belgium/150/99 in the supernatant of fixed explants, non
permissive to infection, were at or below the detection
limit by 48 hpi. This indicates that the titers of the AIVs
by 48 hpi, although low in NE and TE, most likely are
the result of a limited replication.
-Swine influenza isolates-

The three porcine influenza subtypes replicated most
efficiently in the NE, TE and BE with still increasing
virus yields between 24 and 48 hpi. At 48 hpi there
were minimal differences in virus titers between the various subtypes. In these explants, the swine influenza
viruses reached higher virus titers than any of the heterologous viruses, except for A/Panama/2007/99
(H3N2). In the LE, the replication capacity of the swine
influenza viruses was more similar to that of the human
and avian influenza viruses and somewhat lower than in
the other explants.

-Human influenza isolates-

1. Viability

The two human isolates showed a clear distinction in
their replication efficiency. In the NE, TE and BE A/
Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) behaved similar to the swine
influenza viruses, while the virus titers of A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) were in between those of the swine
and avian strains. The virus titers of both subtypes were
highest in the BE and, as for the swine influenza viruses,
lower in the LE.

(NE) and tracheal explants (TE) continued beating for at
least 72 h after sampling.

tracheal (B: orange arrow) explants, single swine influenza virus positive cells were diffusely spread while no avian influenza virus positive cells
were present (a, b). Swine influenza virus positive cells were also found as a continuous line in bronchial epithelium (C), as multiple foci in the
bronchioles (D: red arrows, E) and as single alveolar cells (F: green arrows) in lung explants. Avian influenza viral antigen-positive cells were
limited to bronchiolar epithelium in lung explants (d: red arrows, e). Symbols underneath the pictures give the results for the semi-quantitative

-Avian influenza viruses-

Of the heterologous viruses, the group of AIVs was least
successful in replication and the only one with lower
virus titers at 48 hpi than at 24 hpi in some cases. The
differences in titers between the avian and swine influenza viruses were most pronounced in the NE and TE.
While at 48 hpi, the maximum AIV titer reached 3.1 log
TCID50/ml in the NE, the minimum titer of the swine
influenza viruses was as high as 6.1. In the BE these differences were decreasing and they were even no longer
significant in the LE. Although all AIVs preferentially
bind Neu5Aca2-3Gal b-HexNAc-terminated receptors,

duck and chicken viruses differ by their recognition of
the inner Galb1-3HexNAc or Galb1-4HexNAc linkages
respectively [26]. Still we did not observe a clear distinction in virus yield between the examined duck and
chicken viruses.
Overall, the differences between the virus yields of
swine and AIVs were statistical significant in NE, TE
and BE at 24 and 48 hpi and in LE at 24 hpi only. Titers
of A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) were consistently
lower than those of swine influenza viruses in NE, TE
and BE (except at 24 hpi in the BE). In the same

100% of the epithelium staining positive. Additionally
the BE epithelium showed reactive atypia changing to a
monolayer with few ciliated cells. Many swine influenza
positive cells were also found in the LE. These contained groups of positive epithelial cells or an entirely
positive epithelial lining in large and small bronchioles
and, rarely, single positive alveolar cells. Detection of
AIV positive cells was limited to the bronchioles of LE,
with fewer foci and numbers of positive cells than for
swine influenza viruses. Semi-quantitative analysis of the
IF stainings confirmed these findings, as presented by

3. Dose response curves

Figure 2 shows the effect on the virus yield of Swine/
Gent/7625/99 (H1N2), Duck/Belgium/06936/05 (H4N6)
and Chicken/Belgium/150/99 (H5N2) after inoculation
with 10- and 100-fold lower doses (5 and 4 logEID 50
respectively) than in the principal experiment. The
reduction of the inoculation dose clearly had more effect
on the AIVs than on the swine influenza virus. Inoculation of AIVs at 104 EID50 did not result in infection of
the explants (titers below the detection limit), while for
swine influenza viruses this was only true for NE and
TE. In the BE and LE there was a limited or no reduction of the swine influenza virus yield respectively.
A 10-fold increase of the inoculation dose (105 EID50)
of AIVs still failed to infect NE or TE. Detectable virus
titers were reached in the BE and similar titers as those
obtained with the highest inoculation dose in LE. The
same dose of swine influenza virus resulted in infection
of all explant systems by 48 hpi at levels (almost) identical to the original 106 EID50 dose. The slope of the virus
yields between 1 and 24 hpi was remarkably less steep
in NE and TE than for the highest inoculation dose.
4. Influenza A nucleoprotein detection

An overview of the results is shown in Figure 3. Generally, cells positive by IHC displayed an intense brown
intranuclear staining. They were identified in all the
explant systems inoculated with the swine influenza
virus (H1N2) and only in LE with the AIV (H4N6).
Swine influenza virus positive cells in NE and TE were
limited to diffusely spread single cells in basal and apical
layers of the epithelium with distinctly more positive
cells in the NE than in the TE. In the BE the level of
infection was higher than in NE and TE, with up to

5. Receptor expression

To determine the Sia receptor distribution in the pig
from the nasal mucosa down to the alveoli we performed lectin histochemistry. Considering the results by
van Riel et al. [27] on the pattern of viral attachment
(PVA) of human and AIVs in pig tissues, we focused on
the expression in epithelial cells and glands of NE, TE
and BE and in bronchioles and alveoli of LE. An overview of the results is shown in Table 2.
Both a2-3- and a2-6-galactose linked Sia receptors
were detected in the epithelium of the respiratory tract,
but they displayed a very distinct distribution pattern.
SNA binding (specific toward a2-6-galactose linked Sia)
was abundant from the nasal epithelium down to the
bronchioles, and more moderate in the alveoli (Figure
4). The MAL-I and MAL-II isotypes, which identify
Neu5Ac(a2-3)-Gal(b1-4)-GlcNAc and Neu5Ac(a2-3)Gal(b1-3)-GalNAc respectively [28], gave very different
results. While MAL-I binding was absent in all epithelial
cells, MAL-II binding was rare in nasal, tracheal and
bronchial epithelium and moderate in bronchioles and
alveoli. At the level of the glands, SNA binding intensity
gradually increased from the NE towards the BE. On
the contrary, MAL-I and MAL-II were only binding in
the glands of NE at a moderate level.
Since our findings of lack of binding with MAL-I and
-II in the trachea were in disagreement with previous
reports of Ito et al. [14] and Suzuki et al. [15], we tried
to find an explanation for the discrepant results. Both
used acetone fixed tracheal cryosections and digoxigenin labeled MAA (Dig-MAA). Duck intestines were
used as a positive control. Therefore, we compared
Dig-MAA binding on acetone fixed cryosections of the
trachea with that on paraffin sections of paraformaldehyde fixed tissues. The frozen tissues still showed no
binding of MAA to the tracheal epithelium but more
positive binding to the submucous glands and to blood
vessels (Figure 5).
Because our MAL lectins were biotinylated instead of
digoxigenin labeled we also wanted to exclude that the
different conjugation method was the cause of the

agglutinin II (MAL-II) in the different explant systems. SNA binding (first column) was abundant in the epithelium of nasal (NE), tracheal (TE)
and bronchial explants (BE) and in the epithelium of bronchioles (Bronch.), but moderate at the level of the alveolae (Alv.). MAL-I binding to
epithelial cells was absent to rare in all explants systems (second column). MAL-II binding (third column) was rare in the epithelium of NE, TE
and BE. At the level of the bronchioles and the alveolar tissue, it became moderate to abundant (as indicated by the black arrows).

negative binding in the porcine trachea. For that reason
we compared the binding of biotinylated MAL-I and -II
with digoxigenin labeled MAL-I and -II in duck intestines. This tissue is traditionally used as a positive control because it only expresses Siaa2-3 Gal linkages. The
digoxigenin labeled MAL-I and II, as shown in Figure 6
panel C and c respectively, gave no binding. The biotinylated MAL-I and -II were both binding to the intestinal epithelium but in a different pattern. The MAL-I
(panel A) bound only to the apical surface of the epithelium, while MAL-II (panel a) also bound to the mucus
of the goblet cells. The binding was shown to be specific, since it was abolished when the sections were pretreated with neuraminidase (panels B and b). In the

porcine trachea there was no binding of either biotinylated nor digoxigenin labeled MAL.

Discussion
We have confirmed the susceptibility of porcine respiratory tissues to infection with a range of AIVs. These
AIVs replicated clearly less efficiently in tissues of the
upper (nasal and tracheal) than in the lower (bronchi
and alveolar) respiratory tract. This was associated with
a paucity of a2,3-linked Sia receptors in the nose and
trachea.
The relatively low AIV titers in porcine NE and TE
may in part explain why experimental pig-to-pig transmissions of AIVs have failed so far [22,23]. This hypothesis is further strengthened by the results of our dose

response experiments, in which a 10-fold reduction of
the inoculation dose of AIVs completely abolished infection in NE and TE. A similar 10-fold reduction of the
inoculation dose of a swine influenza viruses did not
eliminate infection, indicating that the predominant distribution of an appropriate receptor is indeed an important determinant for cell tropism [29]. Wild birds
infected with low pathogenic AIVs mainly excrete the
virus via fecal and oculonasal discharges, while aerosol
transmission is much less important [30]. We therefore
speculate that a successful infection of the porcine

upper respiratory tract (URT) with AIVs requires exposure to feces or fecal contaminated material with high
virus concentrations. However, the likelihood that an
entirely AIV successively infects several pigs, allowing a
gradual adaptation to a mammalian host by point mutations, was probably overestimated in the past.
Since the infectivity pattern in our in vitro system is
consistent with previous studies on avian, human and
swine influenza virus attachment and replication, it is a
valuable alternative to in vivo experiments. Two recent
pig infection studies [31,32] clearly showed a lower

replication efficiency for AIVs than for swine influenza
viruses throughout the porcine respiratory tract. In both
studies the AIVs replicated better in the lower (LRT)
than in the upper respiratory tract (URT), but this was
also the case for the swine influenza viruses. The latter
finding contrasts with our in vitro system, in which
swine influenza viruses reached lower titers in LEs than
in NEs. This is most likely due to the presence of fewer
virus-susceptible cells in LEs compared to a same surface area in NEs.
Our results on lectin binding intensities were not
entirely in line with previous studies. We confirmed the
abundant expression of a2-6-linked Sia receptors in the
trachea as well as in other parts of the respiratory tract,
but a2-3-linked Sia receptors were only detected in the
bronchioles and alveoli, with moderate intensity. Overall
we showed the Sia receptor distribution in the pig

tissues to be similar to that in humans [33-35]. Even
when repeating the methods of Ito et al. [14], no a2-3linked Sia receptors could be identified in the trachea.
Van Riel et al. [27] have previously studied the pattern
of virus attachment in porcine respiratory tissues using
labeled avian and human influenza viruses. Human
viruses attached to many cells in the trachea, bronchus,
bronchioles and to a moderate number in the alveolae,
which is in agreement with our SNA binding intensities.
As for the avian viruses, there was a lack of binding in
trachea and bronchus, but increased binding in the lung,
which is in accordance with our MAL-II staining. These
patterns of viral attachment therefore agree with our
lectin stainings, and they dispute the much cited study
by Ito et al. It is of interest to note that chicken and
duck influenza isolates are known to prefer SAa2,3-Gal
b1,4 Glc NAc (as recognized by MAL-I) and SAa2,3-

Van Poucke et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:38
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/38

Gal b1,3 Gal NAc (as recognized by MAL-II) respectively [26,36]. As MAL-I binding in all the explant systems was negative, we would expect a reduced
replication potential of the chicken isolates, which was
not the case. All this fits with the hypothesis of Guo et
al. [37], who state that Sia are necessary but not sufficient to act as the cellular receptor. This could also
explain for the examples where influenza virus entry did
not seem to be affected by a depletion of cell surface Sia
[38,39].
Even within one group of heterologous viruses, some
possess a higher infectivity than others. A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) had a 2 log10 lower viral yield than
A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2). Though both viruses are
expected to have mainly a Siaa2-6 tropism [38], Wan
and Perez [16] have suggested a dual receptor specificity
(for both human- and avian-like receptors) for A/New
Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) and a strict Siaa2-6 preference
for A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2). To assess whether certain viruses are more likely to undergo interspecies
transmissions, molecular differences responsible for this
difference in infectivity will have to be identified.

Conclusions
In this study we successfully developed an in vitro
model that covers the entire porcine respiratory tract
and is permissive to influenza virus replication in a similar way as in vivo. The infectivity of AIVs was shown to
be low in the URT, while the pattern of human influenza viruses more closely resembled that of swine influenza viruses. These findings correlated with the Sia
receptor distribution in the pig tissues, which was
shown to be similar to that in humans. Consequently,
the classical hypothesis on the unique role of the pig as
a mixing vessel, based on the abundant expression of
both a2,3-linked and a2,6-linked Sia receptors in the
trachea, no longer stands. Simultaneous presence of
human- and avian-type receptors has also been identified in humans [34,35,40], ducks and quail [16,41], and
Thompson and colleagues [39] have generated data indicating that co-infection of human ciliated epithelial cells
with human and avian influenza viruses could occur.
Therefore, more detailed studies on the mechanism and
on predisposing factors of reassortment are required to
asses the true role of the pig.
Methods
1. Animals

Five 6-week-old pigs from a high health status farm that
was negative for influenza A viruses were used. The animals were housed together in a HEPA-filtered experimental unit with ad libitum access to water and food.
At arrival they were treated intramuscularly with ceftiofur (Naxcel®, Pfizer-1 ml/20 kg body weight) to clear the

Page 10 of 14

respiratory tract from possible infections with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parasuis and Streptococcus suis. Two days later
they were euthanized by intravenous administration of
thiopental (Penthotal®, Kela-12.5 mg/kg body weight)
and exsanguinated.
2. Isolation and culture of the respiratory explants

To cover both the upper and lower respiratory tract,
four different systems were used: nasal (NE), tracheal
(TE), bronchial (BE) and lung explants (LE).
-Nasal explants-

The NE were cultivated according to the air-liquid interface principle. NE were prepared as described by Glorieux et al. [42]. In short, the respiratory mucosa was
carefully stripped from the medial side of the ventral
turbinates and from the nasal septum. This tissue was
cut in squares of 25 mm2 each, which were transferred
to fine meshed gauzes in 6-well plates with the epithelium facing up. Each well contained two ml of medium
((50% DMEM (Gibco)/50% RPMI (Gibco), penicillin 100
U/ml (Gibco), streptomycin 100 μg/ml (Gibco), gentamycin 0.1 mg/ml (Gibco), glutamine 0.3 mg/ml (BDH
Biochemical)) so the epithelium was slightly immersed
in fluid. Explants were cultured in an incubator at 37°C
and 5% CO2.
-Tracheal organ cultures-

The trachea was excised distal from the larynx and
proximal to the bifurcation. This part was divided in
two by a sagittal incision and both halves were pinned
onto a sterile board so the adventitia and cartilage could
be removed. The remaining tissue (mucosa with some
submucosa) was then cut in pieces of 25 mm2 and processed similar to the nasal mucosa. Cultivation also took
place following the air-liquid interface principle.
-Bronchial organ cultures-

The left lung was removed from the thorax and placed
into transport medium (phosphate buffered saline (PBS),
penicillin 1000 U/ml (Gibco), streptomycin 1 mg/ml
(Gibco), gentamycin 0.5 mg/ml (Gibco), amphotericin B
5 mg/ml (fungizone®, Bristol-Myers)). Next the surrounding lung tissue was manually dissected out until
only the bronchial tree remained. Bronchial rings of
approximately two mm in diameter and three mm long
were cut. These rings were transferred to 16 ml capped
culture tubes containing one ml of medium (MEM
(Gibco), penicillin 100 U/ml (Gibco), streptomycin 100
μg/ml (Gibco), kanamycin 1 μg/ml (Gibco), glutamine
0.3 mg/ml (BDH Biochemical), HEPES 0,02 M/100 ml
(Gibco)). To imitate the in vivo situation, explants were
alternately exposed to air and medium by putting them
at 37°C in a slowly turning device (0.5 turn/minute) for
rotating culture tubes.

-Lung explants-

Thin LE were obtained following a technique described
earlier for rat lung explants [43], with slight modifications. We opened the thorax in the ventral midline and
placed a ligature on the left trachea bifurcation. Two
canules, each connected to a 20 ml syringe, were
advanced down the right trachea bifurcation. One syringe contained cold PBS, the other air. As such the right
lung was simultaneously perfused and aerated in situ. In
the laminar flow the right apical lobe was fully expanded
by inflating a 1% agarose solution. The agarose (type
VII-A low gelling temperature, Sigma) had been dissolved in white PBS, autoclaved, microwave heated and
cooled down to 37°C. The expanded lung was placed at
4°C for 10 minutes in a sterile container until the agarose solidified. This tissue was then cut up in cubes with
a cross section of one cm2, which were transferred to a
20 ml syringe with seven ml of 4% agarose. After replenishing the syringe with more agarose it was placed at 4°
C for 15 minutes. The embedded lung tissue was cut in
slices of one mm thick, using a cryotome blade. These
slices were trimmed until they had a surface of 25 mm2
and incubated overnight in 24-well plates with one ml
of medium (DMEM (Gibco), bovine insulin 2.5 μg/ml
(Sigma), hydrocortisone 0.5 μg/ml (Sigma), vitamin A
0.5 μg/ml (Sigma), gentamycin 0.1 mg/ml (Gibco)) at
37°C and 5% CO 2 . After 24 hours the explants were
thoroughly washed with warm PBS to remove the
remaining agarose. Finally they were transferred to 6well plates with two ml of medium and cultured at 37°C
and 5% CO2.
3. Analysis of viability

To evaluate virus yields over time we had to confirm
that fluctuations in virus titers did not result from a
decreased explant viability.
Nasal and tracheal explants were checked daily for
ciliary beating by light microscopy.
At 0, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post culture two
explants of each system were collected. One was used to
determine the percentage of necrotic cells by an EMA
staining (Invitrogen), the other to determine the percentage of apoptotic epithelial cells using an “In Situ Cell
Death Detection Kit” (Roche) [44]. The latter is based
on Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated
dUTP Nick End Labelling (TUNEL) to detect DNA
strand breaks. The EMA staining was performed on non
fixed tissues, the TUNEL staining on cryostat sections.
From each explant 12 cryosections, dispersed over the
entire sample, were cut. For each section the positive
cells within one ad random selected microscopic field
(magnification 1000×) were counted. The number of
epithelial cells in the NE, TE and BE as well as the total
number of cells in the LE were determined by staining

the nuclei with Hoechst (1:100 diluted in ultra pure
water (U.P.)) (Invitrogen).
-EMA-

The explants were transferred to a 24-well plate and
washed once with medium. They were incubated in the
dark with 300 μl EMA (1/20 diluted in medium) for one
hour at 4°C. Next they were exposed to a bright light
source for 10 minutes. After three more washes with
medium, the explants were embedded in methylcellulose
(Methocel®, Fluka) and preserved at -70°C. Afterwards
six μm thick sections were methanol fixed during 20
minutes at -20°C and counterstained with Hoechst
(1:100 in U.P.) (Invitrogen).
-TUNEL-

The TUNEL reaction was performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The explants were
embedded in methylcellulose, cut into 12 slices of six
μm thick, methanol fixed and counterstained with
Hoechst.
4. Viruses, inoculation and evaluation of virus replication

Three porcine, two human and six AIVs were used
(overview Table 3). The human and porcine influenza
strains were representatives of viruses that are currently
widespread in the human or swine population. The
avian viruses were low pathogenic isolates from both
Galliformes and Anseriformes and belonged to different
HA subtypes. At least three repeats were conducted for
each explant system and each virus subtype.
After 24 hours of culture and one washing step with
PBS, the explants were inoculated with 106 EID50 virus
in a volume of 600 μl. For this purpose, NE, TE and LE
were transferred to 24-well plates while the BE remained
in the cell culture tubes. One hour of incubation with
the inoculum at 37°C was followed by three subsequent
washing steps with 0.5 ml warm PBS so non-attached
viruses were removed. Next the explants were placed
back in the original 6-well plates or culture tubes with
2.3 ml (NE, TE and LE) or 1.3 ml (BE) of new medium.
To assess virus yields, 300 μl of supernatant was collected at 1, 24 and 48 hours post inoculation. Ten-fold
serial dilutions of the supernatant were inoculated onto
MDCK cells grown in 96-well plates. These plates were
incubated for seven days at 37°C with 5% CO 2 and
checked for CPE. The presence of virus replication in
each well was confirmed by an immunocytochemical
staining, which was analyzed by light microscopy. The
cells, fixed with paraformaldehyde 4% for 10 minutes at
room temperature, were incubated with mouse anti-NP
monoclonal HB-65 antibody (1:50, ATCC) for two
hours. Subsequently, incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibody
(1:200, Dako) for one hour was followed by a development step with H202 as substrate and 3-amino-9-ethyl-

carbazole (AEC) as precipitating agent. Virus titers were
calculated by the method of Reed and Muench and
expressed as TCID50/ml. Statistical analysis to compare
the titers of the avian, the swine and human viruses in
Figure 1 was carried out using the Kruskal-Wallis test
with a 95% confidence interval (p < 0.05). The avian and
swine viruses were compared as groups at 24 and 48
hpi, the human viruses were compared separately
because of the consistent differences in virus yield
between the 2 subtypes.
Because the virus titers obtained with AIVs were frequently low, additional controls were performed to confirm that these titers resulted from productive virus
infection rather than from the release of input virus
immediately after the attachment step. To this purpose
a parallel experiment was performed with explants that
only allow attachment of the virus and no virus entry or
subsequent steps [45]. One NE, TE, BE and LE were
prepared as described above. After 24 hours they were
fixed in one ml of 1% paraformaldehyde at 4°C for one
hour. Next they were extensively washed with PBS and
inoculated with 600 μl 106 EID50 Chicken/Belgium/150/
99 (H5N2). After one hour of incubation at 37°C the
inoculum was removed, the explants were washed three
times with PBS and the medium was renewed. Supernatant was again collected at 1, 24 and 48 hpi.
5. Evaluation of the dose response

Additionally we wished to examine the effect of the
inoculation dose on the yield of swine and AIVs at different levels of the respiratory tract. Therefore NE, TE,

BE and LE were inoculated with Swine/Gent/7625/99
(H1N2), Duck/Belgium/06936/05 (H4N6) and
Chicken/Belgium/150/99 (H5N2) at three different
doses: 106, 105 and 104 EID50 virus in a volume of 600
μl. Collection and titration of the supernatant was performed as described above. Each condition was
repeated twice.
6. Influenza A nucleoprotein detection

Since virus titrations of the supernatant do not provide
information on the number or type of infected cells, we
fixed the explants inoculated with Swine/Gent/7625/99
(H1N2) and Duck/Belgium/06936/05 (H4N6) at 48 hpi
to perform immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescense (IF).
IHC was carried out on formalin fixed (for 24 hours)
and paraffin embedded explants. Ten consecutive sections of 4 μm thick were cut in six different areas of
each explant. Because formalin-fixation can cause protein cross-linking, antigen retrieval (AR) was applied to
stain the viral nucleoprotein. Enzyme-induced AR was
accomplished by incubating the deparaffinized and rehydrated sections with 0,1% pronase (Roche) at 37°C for
four minutes. Endogenous peroxidase and biotin activity
were blocked by incubation with 3% H2O2 and the biotin/avidin blocking kit (Vector) at room temperature
respectively. Incubation with the anti-influenza A
nucleoprotein monoclonal antibody at a 1:400 dilution
was performed at room temperature for 90 minutes.
Slides were rinsed three times in 0.05 mol/L Tris-buffer
and incubated with biotin-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse

Van Poucke et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:38
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/38

immunoglobulin at a 1:100 dilution (Dako) for 30 minutes at room temperature. After another wash they were
incubated with the ABC-complex for 30 minutes, developed with AEC (Vector developing kit) and counterstained with hematoxylin.
To exclude that AR gives rise to false positive results,
we compared the localization of virus positive cells after
IHC with those after IF. Therefore similar explants were
embedded in Methocel® (Sigma), frozen at -70°C and
entirely cut in sections of 8 μm thick. These sections
were fixed in methanol for 10 minutes at -20°C. Since
this fixation method only causes precipitation of proteins, AR was not required. The anti-influenza A
nucleoprotein monoclonal antibody was incubated at a
1:50 dilution followed by FITC labeled goat-anti mouse
IgG (Molecular Probes) at a 1:200 dilution, both for one
hour at 37°C.
Semi quantitative information on the infectivity was
obtained by IF on cryosections, where the following
scoring system was applied: -: no virus positive epithelial
cells, +/-: single positive cells covering <10% of the
epithelium, +: between 11 and 40% of the epithelium is
positive, ++: between 41 and 70% of the epithelium is
positive, +++: between 71 and 100% of the epithelium is
positive.
7. Lectin histochemistry

The distribution of a2-3- and a2-6-galactose linked Sia
receptors in explants, 24 hours post culture, was
detected by lectin histochemistry. The tissues had been
fixed in 4% buffered formalin during 24 hours and were
paraffin embedded. In an identical manner fresh nasal,
tracheal, bronchial and lung tissues were analyzed to
check for the effects of cultivation on receptor expression. Because formalin fixation can cause protein crosslinking, thereby hiding antigenic sites, antigen retrieval
(AR) was applied. Nicholls et al. [37] have previously
shown that heat induced AR by microwaving the samples in 10 mM citrate buffer pH 6.0 at 95°C for 15 minutes is the optimal method for the retrieval of Sia
receptors. To exclude false positive results by AR, some
control sections were pretreated with neuraminidase
removing the Sia. In these stainings we obtained negative results, showing that the AR unmasked only the
epitope of interest.
Duck intestines, which only contain Siaa2-3Gal linkages, were used as a control for the specificity of the
MAA and SNA lectins.
-Expression of a2-6 linked Sia-

The a2-6 distribution was examined using a digoxigenin
labelled Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) used at a
1:200 dilution (Roche). Sections were incubated for one
hour at room temperature. Subsequently, the slides were
incubated with 1:200 sheep alkaline phosphatase

Page 13 of 14

conjugated anti-digoxigenin Fab fragments (Roche) and
developed with New Fuchsin (Dako).
-Expression of a2-3 linked Sia-

Two different isoforms of the Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA), MAL-I and MAL-II that both bind to the
a2-3-linked Sia moiety of the receptor, were used. They
do differentiate though at the next glycoside level
between galactose b1-4- or b1-3-linkages respectively
[46]. The biotinylated MAL-I and -II (Vector Laboratories), both 1:200 diluted, were incubated overnight at
4°C. Staining was developed with a strep-ABC complex
1:100 (DakoCytomation) and an AEC-substrate kit (Vector Laboratories). Subsequent sections were also stained
with digoxigenin conjugated MAA from Roche, as used
by Ito and colleagues (16), together with digoxigenin
conjugated MAL-I and MAL-II. The latter were
obtained using the Dig Conjugation Kit (Roche) and
aimed to examine if the conjugation method can influence the lectin binding.
