Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs are short (~21 base) single stranded RNAs that, in plants, are generally
coded by specific genes and cleaved specifically from hairpin precursors. MicroRNAs are critical for
the regulation of multiple developmental, stress related and other physiological processes in plants.
The recent annotation of the genome of the grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) allowed the identification of
many putative conserved microRNA precursors, grouped into multiple gene families.
Results: Here we use oligonucleotide arrays to provide the first indication that many of these
microRNAs show differential expression patterns between tissues and during the maturation of
fruit in the grapevine. Furthermore we demonstrate that whole transcriptome sequencing and
deep-sequencing of small RNA fractions can be used both to identify which microRNA precursors
are expressed in different tissues and to estimate genomic coordinates and patterns of splicing and
alternative splicing for many primary miRNA transcripts.
Conclusion: Our results show that many microRNAs are differentially expressed in different
tissues and during fruit maturation in the grapevine. Furthermore, the demonstration that whole
transcriptome sequencing can be used to identify candidate splicing events and approximate
primary microRNA transcript coordinates represents a significant step towards the large-scale
elucidation of mechanisms regulating the expression of microRNAs at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.

Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (19-24 nt) non-coding
RNAs that play important roles in the regulation of various cellular processes by inhibiting gene expression at the
post-transcriptional level [1-3]. Many miRNAs interact
with target mRNAs, leading to degradation or sequestration from the translational apparatus [4,5]; some miRNAs
target other non-coding transcripts and are required for
the generation of trans-acting small interfering RNAs (tasiRNAs) [6]. miRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of key developmental, stress response and other
physiological processes. While in animals many miRNAs
are derived from introns or untranslated regions of coding
messages, plant miRNAs are typically specified by dedicated MIR genes. These genes are, at least for the most
part, transcribed by RNA polymerase II to yield capped
and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNA) [7].
The RNAse III enzyme Dicer-like-1 (DCL1) mediates the
specific excision of mature miRNAs from the pri-miRNA
via the initial generation of imperfect hairpin precursors
(pre-miRNAs) and the subsequent excision of a duplex
consisting of the mature microRNA and its complementary region (miRNA*) [8,9]. Most, if not all plant miRNAs
then undergo methylation of the 2' hydroxyl group at the
3' ends of this duplex [10] and are subsequently exported
to the cytosol, where one strand, the mature miRNA, is
selectively incorporated into the RNA Induced Silencing
Complex (RISC) which mediates interactions with target
mRNAs [11].
The same, or highly similar mature miRNAs are often
specified by different genomic loci within a species, and
many, but by no means all, miRNAs show broad phylogenetic conservation - similar miRNAs are grouped into
families. Several computational methods have been
developed to identify putative pre-miRNAs by evaluating
the capacity of the genomic context of sequences similar
to known mature miRNAs to form hairpin structures
exhibiting structural and thermodynamic features consistent with known pre-miRNAs (e.g. [12]). Purely ab-initio
approaches to the prediction of non-conserved (lineagespecific) miRNAs have also yielded some notable successes (e.g. [13]), although such approaches are often
plagued by an excess of false positive results. The most
reliable method to identify putative novel pre-miRNAs
remains the sequencing of small RNA fractions [10,14-20]
coupled with the identification of plausible hairpin structures in flanking genomic sequences (e.g. [21]).
Once mature miRNA sequences have been identified,
their expression in different tissues, developmental stages
or environmental conditions can be studied through
experimental approaches such as northern blotting, oligonucleotide arrays or deep-sequencing of isolated small
RNA fractions. However, the fact that identical or highly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/558

similar mature miRNAs can derive from multiple loci
within a single genome limits the capacity of such
approaches to determine which genomic precursor loci
are truly expressed.
Meaningful insight into the regulation of miRNA expression at the transcriptional and other levels is undoubtedly
desirable in the context of post-genomic and systems biology initiatives. However, large scale and in-silico studies of
the regulation of transcription of miRNAs require accurate
definition of primary transcript coordinates on a genomic
sequence, or at the very least, fairly accurate estimates of
transcriptional start sites. Owing to their typically short
physiological half-life, relatively few pri-miRNAs have
been found in EST and large-scale full-length cDNA
sequencing projects in plants. For the same reasons, manual cloning and characterization of primary miRNAs is a
laborious process, and has been performed for relatively
few plant miRNAs [7,22-24].
To date, large-scale analysis of expression of plant miRNAs and associated prediction of precursor sequences
have been restricted to relatively few species and the paucity of complete plant genome sequences limits the possibilities for studies incorporating extensive genomic
information. The recently published genome sequence of
the grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) [25] provides the first
opportunity to study the potential roles of miRNAs in
fruit maturation and other physiological processes of a
commercially important species in the context of a complete genome sequence.
We have previously used comparative methods to predict
140 putative pre-miRNAs (representing 28 conserved
miRNA families) in the grapevine genome [25]. Here we
present experimental validation of a large number of these
predictions using several high throughput methodologies.
Oligonucleotide arrays reveal that several of these families
show significant changes in expression levels in different
tissues and during fruit maturation. Small RNA deepsequencing allowed the precise definition of boundaries
of mature miRNA sequences where comparative predictions left some ambiguity.
Additionally, we demonstrate that deep sequencing of the
polyA+ transcriptome permits the precise identification of
which candidate precursors are expressed in different tissues and shows that, in many cases, fairly precise estimates of primary transcript coordinates may be inferred
from such data. Finally, we show that patterns of splicing
and alternative splicing of pri-miRNAs may be elucidated
from whole transcriptome deep sequencing data and confirm that a significant proportion of grapevine pri-miRNAs are subjected to such processes, consistent with the
suggestion that post-transcriptional regulation might play

a widespread role in the regulation of plant miRNA maturation.

Results and Discussion
In the previous description of 8.4 fold coverage assembly
of the grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) genome [25] we identified 164 candidate conserved miRNAs. Here we present a
comprehensive characterization of conserved miRNAs in
grapevine including a refinement of mature miRNA
sequences and important information regarding pattern
of expression of both mature miRNAs and precursors.
Three complementary approaches were followed to characterize the expression pattern of both the mature miRNAs and their precursors. To allow a comparison between
methods, all technologies were applied to leaf tissue.
Whole transcriptome deep sequencing was performed on
all tissues available from the highly homozygote
sequenced clone PN40024. To maximize the coverage of
tissues studied, microarray and 454 transcriptomic analyses were performed on berries - organs of particular agronomic importance - from other clones as they cannot be
easily obtained from the very weak PN40024 clone.
Comparative prediction of microRNA precursors
We previously used the MicroHarvester software [12] with
all plant miRNAs present in release 9.1 of miRBase [26] to
identify 164 candidate conserved miRNAs and their precursors in the 8.4 fold coverage assembly of the genome
of the grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) [25]. Manual refinement
of these predictions provided 140 high-confidence candidate pre-miRNAs classified in 28 conserved families (79
unique predicted mature microRNA sequences).

For the most part, we confirm existing patterns of miRNA
family conservation with respect to completely sequenced
plant genomes for which extensive analyses of miRNAs
have been performed (Arabidopsis thaliana, Populus trichocarpa, Oryza sativa and Physcomitrella patens). Of the 28
families for which we identified putative precursor
sequences in Vitis vinifera (Table 1), 9 are represented in
all four of these species and a further 10 have been characterized in all three magnoliophytes. One family
(miR403) is present in both of the previously sequenced
Dicots, while two previously Arabidopsis-specific families
(miR828 and miR845) were predicted in grapevine (suggesting their loss or - as yet - undetected presence in poplar), while miR479 and miR482 (annotated only in
poplar and grapevine) are likely to have evolved in a common ancestor of these organisms after its divergence from
the Arabidopsis lineage [25]. miR477 precursors have
been characterized only in poplar, grapevine and P. patens,
while a series of miR535 precursors represent the first
members of this family to be identified in core eudicots,
having been identified only in P. patens, rice and more
recently in the California poppy (Eschscholzia californica)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/558

[27]. The only families tested for which members have
been identified in poplar and at least one other of the
aforementioned genomes but for which microHarvester
failed to identify candidate precursors in the grapevine
genome were miR472, miR530 and miR827.
With respect to the reference annotation of protein coding
genes in the Vitis vinifera genome, 127 putative pre-miRNAs were intergenic in location (17 overlapped with
annotated genes but on the non-coding strand). Four precursor predictions fell within or overlapped annotated
coding or UTR exons although homology searches and
transcriptomics data generated subsequently to the initial
annotations call into question the validity of all but two
of these exon annotations. miRNA 156 h is probably an
incorrect prediction derived from a coincidentally plausible hairpin structure formed by the opposite strand to the
presumed target (a Squamosa-promoter Binding Protein
(SBP) box gene). A similar situation is observed for
miR171 g which falls on the opposite strand to to a GRAS
domain transcription factor gene. Nine precursor predictions were apparently intronic in location. Manual checks
of the automated annotations suggested that all of the
introns putatively containing pre-miRNAs were likely to
be erroneous predictions, being atypically long (over 13
kb) and interrupting putative retroelement derived genes
or obvious fusion gene predictions (not shown).
Deep sequencing of small RNAs from grapevine leaf tissue
We generated 37,219,323 reads with Illumina sequencing
of small RNA isolated from Vitis vinifera L. clone PN40024
leaves. 15,261,352 individual small RNA reads of 19-24
bases (41% of the total reads generated) representing
2,626,822 unique sequences were mapped to the draft
genome after removal of adapter sequences. Over 40% of
the total mapped sequences were of length 21 bases and
accounted for 26.3% of the genomic loci represented by
the mapped data (mean redundancy of 9.25 reads/locus).
34% of loci represented were of length 24 (13.4% of tags
sequenced) with a mean redundancy of 2.27 reads/locus,
suggesting, in accord with other studies [28,29], that miRNAs in our sample tend to be expressed at higher levels or
processed more specifically than the more heterogeneous
24 base small RNAs [see Additional file 1: Supplemental
Table S1].

Mapping of the short tags onto the genome sequence
revealed that of the 28 families predicted by our comparative analysis, 22 showed at least one sequence tag either
in exact or very close correspondence to the position of
one of the predicted mature sequences (the exceptions
being miR403, miR477, miR535, miR828, miR482 and
miR845). For some families, thousands or even hundreds
of thousands of short RNA sequences were recovered
(miR156, miR164, miR166, miR167, miR172, miR393,

For each predicted pre-miRNA the table reports: the mature sequence, the number of perfect matching short RNA reads observed in leaf (column
A), tissues in which significant expression of the precursor was observed by Illumina whole transcriptome sequencing (column B, where L = leaf, R
= root, S = stem, C = callus), the presence of 454 reads including the precursor sequence in leaf (column C, where Y = yes, N = no), and tissues
where the Combimatrix oligoarray showed significant expression of the mature sequence (column D, where L = leaf, I = inflorescence, R = root, Bg
= immature berry, Bv = veraison, Bm = mature berry). Asterisks indicate signal detected for precursor in that tissue. Mature miRNAs are ordered
to reflect expected cases of crosshybridization for oligonucleotide arrays. For all microRNAs, chromosome, strand and coordinates of the
precursor miRNA are provided (scaffold coordinates indicate that the miRNA was situated on a scaffold not incorporated into the 8.4× genome

miR396), while less than 1000 sequences corresponded
to each of the remaining represented families. In some
cases, the most commonly observed sequences were identical to at least one of the predicted mature sequences
(notably: miR156, miR160, miR164, miR167, miR169,
miR172, miR394, miR399) while for other families, the
predominant mature miRNA sequenced exhibited small
variations (shifts or differences of length of one or two
bases) with respect to the predicted mature sequences
(e.g. miR166, miR393, miR395, miR396, miR408). This
finding was not unexpected given the variation in mature
miRNA lengths within families observed in other plant
species and the nature of the comparative method used to
generate the initial predictions. For three families
(miR171, miR397, mir398) the predominant species
sequenced showed greater shifts with respect to the prediction. While in the case of miR171 and miR397, shifts

of up to three bases within or between organisms are registered in miRBase (Figure 1A, B), the grapevine miR398
family presented several mature sequences that varied by
up to 8 bases with respect to one another (Figure 1C). For
other predicted precursors for which matching small RNA
reads were recovered, the vast majority of reads conform
to the sequences indicated in Table 1 [see also Additional
File 1: Supplemental figure S3], consistent with the primary requirement for the annotation of plant miRNA
sequences [30].
We recovered a number of reads that include an additional 3' base that does not correspond to any genomic
locus, this tendency has been observed in other species
(e.g. [28]). Furthermore, a low but notable proportion of
mapped small RNA sequences show mismatches to the
genomic sequence while preferentially mapping only to

Alignments of predicted and observed mature miRNA sequences for three miRNAs. For each miRNA, the
sequence predicted by comparative analyses and the number of corresponding small RNA reads are shown in blue, while the
most frequent small RNA derived from the genomic locus (and the corresponding number of observed reads) are shown in

putative miRNA precursor loci. This is probably due to
errors in sequencing or during reverse transcription or
amplification. Some families (notably miR168) show a
greatly exaggerated tendency towards sequence errors
with 13,477 short sequences showing a single substitution (G in the genomic sequence, A in the reads recovered) from the predicted sequence and not exhibiting
satisfactory alternative map positions on the grapevine
genome (not shown). This is possibly due to known
increased error rate of the Illumina sequencing strategy in
GC rich sequences [31] although the intriguing possibility
of RNA editing cannot be excluded. The expected miR482
mature sequence was not observed but the miRNA*
sequence was present, albeit at low frequency. During the
course of these analyses it became clear that two precursors (miR172a and 172b) were likely to derive from the
opposite strand from that initially predicted. Where

appropriate, corrected mature sequences have been
deposited in miRBase.
Due to identity or similarity among mature miRNAs
belonging to the same family, deep sequencing of small
RNAs does not allow consistent unambiguous assignment
of mature miRNAs to their genomic loci of origin. Nevertheless our analysis provided indications of the presence
and abundance of 47 distinct mature miRNAs from conserved families in leaves - corresponding to up to 97 distinct precursor loci (see Table 1 for summary and
Additional File 1: Supplemental figure S3 for detailed
maps of all small RNA reads mapping to predicted precursors). The error prone nature of the small RNA deep
sequencing data likely gives rise to a certain number of
false positive matches. In fact in cases where hundreds of
thousands of reads represent a single family, sequence
and reverse transcription errors lead to the coincidental

Oligonucleotide design strategy for Combimatrix custom oligonucleotide array
Oligonucleotide design strategy for Combimatrix custom oligonucleotide array. Probes were designed complementary to the predicted mature miRNA (green line) and miRNA* (thick black line) sequences. Additional probes were

with respect to the miRNA and miRNA* sequences.

generation of mature sequences that perfectly match other
precursor sequences. For example, over 800,000 reads
perfectly matched miR156b/c/d, while over 2000 reads
matched miR156a (whose sequence differs from the
miR156b/c/d mature sequence by a single base). The
mean Illumina base call quality score for this position in
the miR156a matches was 11.7 versus 30.6 for the same
position in the miR156b/c/d matching tags (37.4 and
35.1 for the flanking positions in the miR156a matched
sequences). A similar pattern was observed for several
other mature/precursor clusters and we conclude that,
particularly when mature sequences differ by only a single
base, it is difficult to reliably differentiate between precursors of origin with current small RNA deep-sequencing
data.
Oligonucleotide arrays
A 12K CombiMatrix custom array was developed to validate our in-silico miRNA predictions and to profile miRNAs expression in different tissues.

no significant hybridization for these probes occurred. On
the contrary, for probes shifted 5 nucleotide towards the
5' end of the miRNA precursor the lack of signal drop-off
might be due to the fact that probes were synthesized with
their 3' termini towards the slide, and that no "spacer" oligonucleotide was used (according to CombiMatrix protocols). As a consequence, steric effects might reduce the
specificity determined by the 3'-most five bases of the
probes.
Other than for 26 out of 140 pre-miRNAs (Table 1), no
detectable signals were recorded for the probes designed
on the precursor loop regions - likely due to size fractionation of RNA samples and the relatively short half-life of
pre-miRNAs. We conclude that our miRNA expression
data are principally derived from mature miRNAs molecules, without appreciable pre-miRNA contamination.

Slides were hybridized with low molecular weight RNA
(LMW-RNA), extracted from six grapevine (V. vinifera L. cv
Corvina) tissues: ripening berries (three stages analyzed),
roots, leaves and young inflorescences. Each hybridization and LMW-RNA extraction was performed twice.

Finally, it should be noted that recent studies have demonstrated appreciable levels of cross-hybridization
between closely related miRNAs and probes differing by
only one or two bases [32]. It is therefore difficult to
exclude the possibility that cross-hybridization within
miRNA families causes a distortion of quantitative estimates of expression levels of some individual mature
miRNA sequences.

In addition to the mature miRNA sequences, the probe set
included probes shifted 5 or 10 bases 3' or 5' with respect
to the central base of the corresponding mature miRNAs
as well as probes derived from regions of the stem not predicted to overlap with the mature miRNA sequence and
controls containing maximally destabilizing substitutions
with respect to probe sequences (Figure 2). Except for
probes shifted 5 nucleotides towards the 5' end of the
miRNA precursor, for more than 90% of the probes a signal drop-off greater than 90% was observed - indicating

Microarray analysis of miRNA expression
Of the mature miRNA sequences considered, 56 (corresponding to 23 different families), showed significant
expression in at least one tissue tested (Table 1 and Additional File 1: Supplemental Figure S2), and another 6
showed a borderline signal. Specifically, 41 different miRNAs showed significant signal in roots, 47 in leaves, 49 in
young inflorescences, 53 in green berries, 42 in berries at
veraison (the point where growth ends and maturation
begins) and 40 in mature berries.

To evaluate the statistical significance of the differential
expression of mature miRNAs in the six tissue considered,
we set up two distinct comparisons: one among the three
developmental stages of the ripening berries and the other
one among leaves, roots and inflorescences. ANOVA analyses were performed with a P-value threshold of 0.05 and
subsequently a Scheffè test was used to assess which of the
three tissues showed significant differences. Thirteen different mature miRNAs showed a statistically significant
change in signal between the ripening stages of the berry
(Figure 3A-C), and 27 miRNAs showed significant
changes in their expression when comparing three different tissues (leaves, roots and inflorescences)(Figure 3DH). miR395a and miR171 h show a distinctive pattern of
expression - being highly expressed at veraison with
respect to the other two stages (4.4 and 2.3 fold changes
of expression level respectively) (Figure 3A). Seven miRNAs (miR156f, miR169a, miR169f, miR169r, miR169x,
miR319b and miR535a) are more expressed in mature
berries than in green berries (Figure 3B). Four miRNAs
(miR171c, miR172c, miR396c, miR403a) are, on the contrary, more expressed in green berries, their expression
decreasing during ripening (Figure 3C).
Clear patterns also emerge from analyses of differential
expression between roots, leaves and young inflorescences. Thirteen miRNAs are significantly differentially
expressed in roots, showing a similar expression in the
other tissues. In particular miR397a, miR398b and
miR408 all show at least 100 fold higher expression in
root than either leaf or early inflorescences, while
miR159a, miR160a, miR399a, miR399b, miR403a and
miR535 show more modest, but still significant, changes
in the same comparisons (Figure 3D). On the contrary
miR164a, miR164b, miR171c and miR172c show a significantly lower level of expression in roots (Figure 3F).
Five miRNAs (miR169v, miR169y, miR171f, miR171 h
and miR319b) yield significantly higher signals in young
inflorescences than both leaves and roots (between 2 and
7.2 fold higher levels in this tissue)(Figure 3E). Only one
miRNA, miR160c, shows a leaf-specific expression profile
(2.5 fold lower level in leaves with respect to other tissues)
(Figure 3G). Finally, six miRNAs (miR169a, miR169e,
miR169f, miR169x, miR171e and miR395a) exhibit significant differences in expression levels in all comparisons
between leaf, root and inflorescences (Figure 3H). Five of
these miRNAs (169a, 169e, 169f, 169x and 171e) show
the highest expression in young inflorescences and the
lowest in roots.
Following the widespread assumption that many miRNA/
target interactions are conserved between related species
[1,2], our data regarding differential expression of mature
miRNA sequences raise some intriguing possibilities par-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/558

ticularly with respect to the potential importance of
miRNA in the regulation of fruit maturation.
Li et al. [33] recently showed that the transcription factor
NFYA5 is targeted by miR169 and that overexpression of
miR169 leads to excessive water loss through leaves and
hypersensitivity to drought stress in A. thaliana. In this
light, the preponderance of miR169 family members in
the group of miRNAs upregulated in mature berries is
striking and might reflect a mechanism to protect maturing fruit from dehydration. We also note that miR535
family, identified so far only in O. sativa and P. patens [34]
is upregulated during berry maturation. This is a first indication of a possible function of miR535 for which no
information was previously available. miR396c shows 6
fold decrease in expression during ripening. The mir396
family targets seven Growth Regulating Factor (GRF) genes
in Arabidopsis [13]. GRF genes encode putative transcription factors associated with cell expansion in leaf and
other tissues in A. thaliana and O. sativa [35,36]. A potential role for miR396 in the regulation of cell expansion
during fruit maturation is an intriguing hypothesis. In
addition, recent data also link miR396 to responses to abiotic stresses including drought [37], again suggesting the
importance of water homeostasis during berry ripening.
miR172, downregulated during berry maturation, targets
Apetala 2 (AP2) -like transcription factors, regulators of
flowering time, organ identity and of vegetative phase
change [38]. In grapevine, genes related to AP2 are upregulated at veraison, being involved in berry maturation
[39] and putatively connected with abiotic and biotic
stress resistance. This evidence fits well with our findings.
The sharp up-regulation of miR395 at veraison suggests a
further role for miRNAs in an agronomically important
aspect of grape maturation. miR395 is known to contribute to the regulation of sulfur metabolism, targeting both
sulfate transporters and ATP sulphurylase genes. A direct
connection between ATP sulfurylases and berry maturation has not been demonstrated, but it is known that a
Glutathione S-transferase is strongly connected with berry
ripening and in particular with coloration during berry
development [39].
miR397a, miR398b and miR408 which are extremely
highly expressed in root tissues target various copper proteins: plantacyanin, laccases and a superoxide dismutase,
all putatively involved in stress responses and lignification
[13,15,40,41]. These miRNAs have also been shown to be
coexpressed in Arabidopsis under conditions of copper
deprivation [42]. Moreover some laccase genes in Arabidopsis are root specific (for example AtLAC15) or mostly
expressed in roots [43] and are involved in root elongation and lignification [44]. Given that grapevine roots are
much more lignified than those of Arabidopsis, it is plausible that regulation of laccase expression is vital in the

Page 11 of 19

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:558

grapevine. It is interesting to note that the laccase family
is, along with other polyphenol oxidase gene families,
massively expanded in grapevine with respect to Arabidopsis (>60 genes in V. vinifera, 17 in Arabidopsis).
The complementary approaches utilized in the current
work allowed us to uncover relevant shortcomings of both
oligoarray and small RNA deep sequencing in the characterization of miRNA expression patterns. In particular, oligonucleotide arrays, for the most part, do not yield
sufficient specificity to discriminate between family members. Our custom array, in which sequences of various
length outside the predicted mature miRNA were
included, clearly indicates that cross-hybridization is
likely to present a confounding factor. For small RNA
sequencing by Illumina technology, sequence features
and/or post-transcriptional modification may be important features causing unforeseen biases determining an
underestimate of abundance of specific miRNA families.
This is suggested by the fact that some families, such as
miR162, miR535, mirR403, miR482 generated few or no
leaf small
RNA sequence reads, even if they can be clearly detected
by northern blotting (miR162, miR482, not shown) or
oligonucleotide arrays (miR162, mir403, miR535) in the
same tissues. Our data suggest that this anomaly is not
caused by the presence of unprocessed precursors in the
samples used for oligonucleotide array analyses, although
we cannot exclude the possibility of environmentally
influenced or clone-specific expression patterns of these
microRNAs influencing our results. However, it is interesting to note that some of these sequences (e.g. miR535
which contains several repeats of the motif 'GAG') have
characteristics known to be associated with high levels of
sequencing errors with Illumina technology [31].
Whole transcriptome sequencing and differential
expression of precursors
The majority of plant miRNA genes are transcribed by
RNA polymerase II and result in the production of polyadenylated primary transcripts [7]. A strict correlation
between expression levels of individual precursors and
levels of mature miRNAs should not be expected. Mature
miRNAs are likely to be, in general, more stable than their
corresponding primary transcripts and may derive from
more than one genomic locus. Furthermore, recent data in
plants [45] and animals [46] suggest that a variety of
mechanisms, including alternative splicing and the specific binding of protein factors, can regulate the efficiency
with which pri- or pre-miRNAs are processed. High levels
of primary transcript can thus be associated with low levels of mature miRNAs and vice-versa. These considerations notwithstanding, it is reasonable to presume that
sequences derived from highly expressed pri-miRNA tran-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/558

scripts should be represented in whole transcriptome
"deep sequencing" experiments.
To investigate this hypothesis, we have analyzed whole
polyA+ transcriptome data generated with the Illumina
Solexa technology [47] and Roche 454 next generation
sequencing platforms.
A total of 135,047,735 Illumina sequences (33-35 bases
in length) derived from polyA+ RNA isolated from 4 tissues (in vitro cultivated juvenile leaf (29,829,113
sequences), in vitro cultivated juvenile stem (30,785,175
sequences), in vitro cultivated juvenile root (29,254,635
sequences) and embryonic callus (45,178,812 sequences)
were mapped to the grapevine genome and coordinates
compared to those for predicted pre-miRNAs.
The statistical significance of the number of reads mapping within a predicted pre-miRNA was evaluated (see
Materials and Methods) and 52 predicted precursors show
significant expression in at least one tissue (25 in leaf, 38
in stem, 17 in root, 33 in callus)(Table 1). Many predicted
precursors show a wide expression (miR156d, miR159c,
miR166a and c, miR168, miR171a, miR398a, miR398b
and c, miR408, miR482). In some families, when
expressed, precursors show overlapping patterns. For
example, miR319c, miR319e and miR319f are all
expressed in stem, while miR319c and miR319 g are
expressed in callus, no expression of miR319 was detected
in leaf or root. A similar situation is observed for the
miR396 family. In other cases, different precursors seem
to be predominantly expressed in different tissues. For
example miR171e transcripts are detected only in callus,
miR171f is only transcribed in stem while miR171 g is
observed in callus and root - a similar situation can be
observed for several families including miR166, miR167
and miR169). These data suggest that tissue specific
expression of different precursors within single families is
widespread in the grapevine.
454 sequencing generated 613,098 and 581,655 reads
respectively from leaf and berry polyA+ RNA. The expression of 15 unique predicted precursor sequences received
ulterior support from these data (Table 1). With the exception of miR160b and the miR535 family the expression of
all precursors detected by 454 sequencing in leaf was also
strongly supported by Illumina data. Interestingly, given
the lack of detectable expression of the mature sequence
in leaf or berry, miR482 precursors were detected at high
levels both by Illumina and 454 sequencing, suggesting
post-transcriptional regulation of processing of this transcript.

Transcription and splicing of pri-miRNAs in Vitis vinifera. A summary of transcription of genomic loci containing predicted pre-miRNAs is provided. Illumina whole transcriptome reads per base are reported for four tissues as log(number of

(blue bars), 454 reads (black bars) and assembled 454 sequence contigs (green bars). Predicted genes where present are represented by red bars. Panel A refers to miR394B, panel B to miR162 and panel C to miR168.
Estimation of primary microRNA transcripts and splice
sites
For a number of predicted microRNAs the density of coverage of the corresponding genomic loci was sufficient to
attempt to estimate primary transcript coordinates as well
as patterns of splicing and alternative splicing.

We constructed Position Specific Scoring Matrices
(PSSMs) of experimentally validated grapevine canonical
splice donor and acceptor contexts (French-Italian Consortium for Characterization of the Grapevine Genome,
unpublished data) and used these matrices to evaluate all
possible canonical splice donors and acceptors from 3 kb
upstream to 3 kb downstream of predicted microRNA precursors showing extensive coverage by Illumina RNA-Seq
reads. The positions and flanking exonic sequences of all
possible splice donor/acceptor pairs were used to combinatorially generate possible splice junctions. RNA-Seq
reads which did not map perfectly to the genome
sequence were compared to these computationally generated splice junctions and pairs providing perfect matches
(with at least 8 bases on either side of the splice junction)
were recorded along with the tissue distribution of reads
supporting each splice event. Additionally, for each supported splice event, we recorded the ratio of base coverage
by RNA-Seq of the flanking 40 putatively exonic bases and
the coverage of flanking 40 putatively intronic bases (not
including reads previously identified as covering the puta-

tive splice junction). Three fold greater coverage of exonic
regions was considered as additional support for the presence of a functional splice junction. Introns inferred from
mapping of 454 transcriptome reads were also recorded.
Visual examination of RNA-Seq coverage of regions
upstream and downstream of miRNA precursor loci was
used to provide initial estimates of transcript start and end
positions. This step was complicated by the known propensity of RNA-Seq to provide uneven coverage of transcript termini - presumably due to the dynamics the
nebulization step in sample preparation and to issues
associated with differential recovery of fragments during
sample preparation. Accordingly, we subjected the 6 kb
interval centered on predicted precursors to promoter prediction analysis by TSSP-TCM [48] in order to attempt to
provide support for manually identified transcription
start sites. Estimated transcript coordinates, putative
intron coordinates quality scores for each donor/acceptor,
frequencies of splice junction-covering reads, and TSS proposed by TSSP-TCM are reported in Additional File 1: Supplemental Table S4.
Figure 4 shows the transcriptional landscape for the
genomic region from 3 Kbp upstream to 3 Kbp downstream of three exemplar predicted miRNA precursors,
including introns inferred from 454 and Illumina
sequence data, the concordance of splicing events identi-

fied by 454 and Illumina reads is notable and consistent
with the reliability of the Illumina data to infer splicing
events. Detailed genomic alignments of all reads supporting splices indicated in Figure 4 are available in Additional
File 1: Supplemental Figure S5. We note that relative numbers of tags representing different regions of putative primary miRNA transcripts vary but tend to be consistent
between different tissues. The GC content of 100 base
windows centered on each genomic position are also
shown and illustrate, within the proposed primary transcripts, an apparent correspondence between depth of
coverage and GC content [31].
Figure 4A shows the transcriptional context of miR394b
and the presence of a canonical intron supported by 14
Illumina reads (7 distinct sequences). This intron was also
easily detectable through RACE experiments (see Additional File 1: Supplemental Table S4). We note that the
position of the intron corresponds well to a region of low,
or undetectable levels of Illumina transcriptome coverage,
and that tissue specific differences in Illumina reads mapping to this region are quite apparent. These data suggest
that our approach is capable of identifying introns in primiRNA transcripts and differences in steady state levels of
pri-miRNA transcripts between tissues. Additionally, 3'
RACE experiments indicated a transcript 3' end within 20
bp of the position predicted from RNA-Seq read coverage
(see Additional File 1: Supplemental Table S4).
The miR162 precursor (Figure 4B) is of particular interest
in that it covers a region including several potential
canonical introns that are supported by multiple Illumina
and 454 reads. All tissues indicate that the transcriptional
start site falls between positions 4,714,680 - 4,714,687 on
chromosome 17. The postulated canonical introns imply
alternative splicing of the nascent primary transcript from
this locus, as does the coverage of the region by 454 contigs (whose map positions are also consistent with the
Illumina data with respect to the overall coordinates of
the nascent primary transcript). Several of these introns,
and the alternative splicing of this transcript were also
supported by preliminary RACE experiments (see Additional File 1: Supplemental Table S4). Indeed, while the
boundaries of proposed introns correspond to "shoulders" of falling transcript coverage, significant levels of
reads mapping within the introns are observed. Interestingly, Hirsch et al. [45] recently demonstrated that the primary miR162a transcript of Arabidopsis is subjected to
complex pattern of alternative splicing, similar to that
proposed for the grapevine miR162 transcript. In Arabidopsis, only unspliced isoforms are capable of yielding
mature miRNAs. Our findings therefore suggest conservation of alternative splicing as a key regulatory mechanism
in miR162 expression and indicate that Illumina and 454

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/558

transcript data can also be used to identify alternatively
spliced plant pri-miRNAs.
Figure 4C shows evidence for expression of the miR168
locus. Analogously to miR162, our data suggest alternative splicing of the pri-mRNA, while the distribution of
454 contigs is highly consistent with the Illumina data.
Vaucheret et al. [49] showed that AGO1, the target of
miR168 is involved in the regulation of miR168 stability.
Our data may hint at yet another mechanism of regulation
of this intriguing miRNA.
Of 25 precursor loci chosen on the basis of extensive RNASeq coverage (see Additional File 1: Supplemental Table
S4), 18 showed evidence of transcript splicing and 8 of
alternative splicing, suggesting that post-transcriptional
modification of miRNA transcripts is likely to be widespread. It is possible that some splicing events frequently
identified by deep sequencing approaches could be associated with regulation of downstream processing of transcripts as has been shown for the miR162 transcript of
Arabidopsis [45]. For miR162 and miR168, this hypothesis might be consistent with the low levels of mature
microRNA observed by deep-sequencing, in contrast to
the apparently high spliced transcript levels. For several
pre/pri-miRNA loci (notably miR162 and miR168) we
infer several closely related canonical introns (shared
splice donors with splice acceptor sites shifted by a few
tens of bases or vice-versa). We speculate that this phenomenon might be due, in part, to the incapacity of the
Nonsense Mediated Decay pathway (which is dependent
on ribosomal scanning of mRNAs [50] to monitor "erroneous" splicing of non-coding transcripts.
The estimation of primary transcript coordinates, and in
particular transcription start sites is a critical step towards
the elucidation of specific mechanisms regulating the
expression of miRNAs at the transcriptional level. Our
Illumina transcript reads are non-directional - it is not
possible to establish from which strand of the genome a
transcript is derived. However, we show elsewhere that
both concomitant transcription of both genomic strands
at single loci and transcription of intergenic regions are
rare in grapevine (French-Italian Consortium for Characterization of the Grapevine Genome, unpublished data).
Thus, evidence of transcription of intergenic pre-miRNAs
can reasonably be considered as validation of transcription of the precursor.
The finding that relative depth of coverage of different
regions of primary transcripts is consistent between tissues suggest the presence of systematic biases in either the
procedure used to fragment the cDNA, in amplification of
fragments for sequencing, or in sequencing efficiency.
Dohm et al. [31] observed a strong relationship between

Page 14 of 19

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:558

local GC content and depth of coverage with Illumina
genome resequencing. Indeed, we observe a relationship
between local GC content and depth of coverage - even
within regions that show contiguous coverage and are
unlikely to represent introns (correlation between log coverage for positions represented by at least one sequence
and GC content of 100 base window centered on that
position for all bases within 3 kb of a predicted precursor
is >0.25 for all tissues, p = 0). However, grapevine introns
between both coding and non-coding exons show a low
GC content (34.7 and 32.3% respectively) with respect to
coding and non-coding exons (44 and 37.3% respectively) [25]. Thus, it may be difficult to differentiate
between introns and regions where low coverage is a
result of low GC content in exonic regions on the basis of
Illumina transcriptome data - particularly where levels of
template are likely to be low and a-priori gene models are
not available. However, the discovery that putative splice
junctions for pri-miRNAs can be identified by discontiguous mapping of illumina reads may help to ameliorate
this problem for plant pri-miRNAs. The fact that we recovered evidence of alternative splicing of miR162, is consistent with data from A. thaliana [45] and validates our basic
approach. Indeed, other putative pri-miRNAs, including
miR394b show evidence of splicing from both transcript
coverage and discontiguous mapping of whole transcriptome reads.

Conclusion
We have used a combination of high throughput
approaches to show highly tissue specific expression of
mature miRNAs in the grapevine Vitis vinifera including
the first evidence of differential expression of miRNAs
during fruit maturation in this species. We have shown
that, for plants at least, whole transcriptome sequence
data can be applied to the detection of differential transcription of putative precursor miRNA loci and to the
detection and definition of pri-miRNAs as well as to the
tentative definition of patterns of splicing in such precursors. It is probable that similar analyses performed in lines
carrying mutations in genes involved in miRNA processing (in particular DCL1- plants) will allow more extensive
and accurate definition of miRNA transcripts on a large
scale, eventually facilitating detailed analyses of promoter
sequences and a deeper understanding of mechanisms of
transcriptional regulation of miRNA genes. Our analyses
also suggest that splicing (and alternative splicing) of primiRNAs may be widespread and might constitute a general mechanism for the regulation of miRNAs.

Methods
Plant materials
Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) clone PN40024 plants and callus tissue were cultivated in vitro under standard conditions. For oligonucleotide array analyses, fresh tissues,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/558

with exception of roots (where in vitro cultivated plants
were used), were collected from field-grown V. vinifera L.
cv Corvina. Grape berries were harvested 5, 9 and 15
weeks after flowering, while leaves were collected from
pre-flowering plants, inflorescence samples were collected
3 weeks before flowering.
RNA extraction and deep sequencing
For Illumina deep sequencing, total RNA from PN40024
was extracted with the Spectrum Plant Total RNA Kit
(SIGMA) as directed by the manufacturer. RNA was
DNase treated with RQ1 RNAse-Free DNAse (Promega)
and RNA integrity was checked using an Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer.

Total RNA samples from leaf, root, stem and callus were
processed using proprietary kits at Illumina, Inc. in Hayward (CA, USA). Briefly, PolyA+ RNA was isolated from
total RNA fragmented using Ambion RNA fragmentation
buffer. cDNA synthesis was performed with Invitrogen
random hexamer primers and cDNA was purified using
QIAquick PCR spin column (Qiagen). Ends were blunted
and 3' A overhangs introduced using T4 DNA polymerase
and E. coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment. cDNAs
were ligated to adapters with a single 'T' base overhang.
After selection of 150-200 bp fragments from 2% lowrange agarose gel, samples were amplified by 18 PCR
cycles to enrich cDNAs with correctly ligated adapters and
to amplify the amount of DNA in the library. Samples
were loaded on Cluster Station to create flow cells of
CSMA (Clonal Single Molecular Array) and sequenced on
the Illumina platform. RNA-Seq data are available from
http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/externe/gmorse/raw_data/.
Small RNAs (20-30 nt) were isolated from leaf total RNA
by a denaturing PAGE gel. Samples were prepared for
sequencing using proprietary kits at Illumina, Inc (CA,
USA). Briefly, 5' and 3'-adapters were ligated to small
RNAs. After reverse transcription, a low number of PCR
cycles were used to create a sufficient amount of cDNA
constructs. cDNA sample was then loaded on the Cluster
Station and sequenced at ultra-high throughput on the
Illumina platform at Illumina. Small RNA sequencing
data are available from the Short Reads Archive (SRA)
under accession number SRS005164.
For 454 transcriptome analysis, polyA+ RNA was isolated
from V. vinifera L. cv Corvina leaf and berry tissues by
according to Rezaian and Krake [51]. After reverse transcription using an oligo(dT)-adapter primer for first
strand synthesis, cDNAs were amplified with 18 (leaf) and
17 (berry) cycles of LA-PCR [52]. Normalization was carried out by one cycle of denaturation and reassociation of
the cDNA. Reassociated ds-cDNA was separated from the
remaining ss-cDNA (normalized cDNA) by passing the

Page 15 of 19

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:558

mixture over a hydroxylapatite column. After hydroxylapatite chromatography, the ss-cDNA was amplified with 9
LA-PCR cycles using phosphorylated primers. cDNAs were
finally purified using the NucleoSpin ExtractII kit from
Macherey & Nagel and subjected to sequencing on the
ROCHE 454 GS FLX platform according to manufacturer's
instructions.
For oligonucleotide array analyses, total RNA was
extracted from V. vinifera L. cv Corvina tissues and size
fractioned, following the procedure [53] with minor modifications. Before extracting RNA from berries, seeds were
separated from the rest of the fruit. Low molecular weight
(LMW) RNA was checked for quality and quantity using
the NanoDrop Spectrometer (ND 1000, Celbio SpA) and
the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyazer.
Oligonucleotide arrays
Predicted grapevine miRNA precursor sequences have
been published elsewhere (Jaillon et al., 2007). A CombiMatrix 12K CustomArray was synthesized with 1947
miRNA-specific probes synthesized to test grapevine
miRNA expression profiles.

For each grapevine miRNA precursor, we designed a set of
20-22 nt probes specific for the mature miRNA, the
miRNA* and their complementary sequences, as well as a
probe specific for the non mature microRNA stem/loop
region and probes designed on the miRNA and miRNA*
sequences but shifted of five or ten nt, forward and backward in order to test probe specificity. snRNA U6 and four
grapevine tRNA probes were used as positive controls.
Fourteen distinct negative and mRNA degradation control
probes were included. Additionally, for each specific
probe, a mismatch control with 2 maximally destabilizing
substitutions was included. Each probe was present on the
final array in three replicates. All probe sequences are
available in Additional File 2: Supplemental Table S6.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/558

used to estimate the reliability of each signal. Probes with
a median signal higher than background and with PM/
MM value higher than 1.2 were called as present. The normalization between arrays was performed using the quantile normalization method [54] using the BLIST software,
provided by Combimatrix.
Normalized signals were Log2 transformed and probes
with a low PM/MM ratio (<1.2) were discarded. Differentially expressed genes in various tissues were identified
with a one-way ANOVA test (p-value < 0.05). Significant
results were further investigated with Scheffè test, a post
hoc test to define which tissues showed significant differences.
The use of short RNA probes has not proven to be effective
to distinguish between miRNAs that have few differences,
in particular at the first or last nucleotide [32], therefore
microarray data from closely related miRNAs have been
treated as replicated data. Thus different miRNA precursors that give rise to almost identical mature products
have been clustered as single entities.
Complete oligonucleotide array experimental design and
data are available from the Gene Expression Omnibus
[GEO: GSE13801].

Slides were hybridized with 3 g of LMW RNA labeled with
Cy5 (Mirus LabelIT miRNA labeling Kit (Mirus Bio
Corp.)). Hybridization and washing were performed as
indicated by CombiMatrix. Slides were scanned with a
Perkin Elmer Scanarray 4000 XL raw data was extracted
with Scanarray Express 4.0 and Microarray Imager (CombiMatrix) software. After each hybridization, slides were
stripped according to manufacturer's instructions and reused 5 to 6 times.

RACE experiments
Total RNA was extracted from V. vinifera L. cv Corvina
leaves, using a rapid CTAB method, as described [55],
with minor modifications, and DNAse treated (DNase I
from Sigma). The FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit (Ambion)
was used to perform classic 3' and 5' RACE protocols, following manufacturer's instructions. PCR products,
obtained with gene specific primers (miR482-5'-RoutCGGCATAGGATCTGAGTCCAC,
miR482-5'-RinnGAAATCCCCGAAAACAATAGGA,
miR482-3'-FoutCGGTTTTCAGATTGGGTTATGA,
miR482-3'-FinnAGGAAGAATGGTGGATTCATTA,
miR394b-5'-RoutCCTCTTTTGTGGCTGTGAGATG,
miR394b-5'-RinnTGAAAGAGGCAAAGAGGAGGAG,

miR162-3'-FinnGGTTTATCTTCCGATGGAGAAC), were subsequently
cloned in pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced.

Two hybridizations were performed with independently
extracted LMW RNAs, for each sample. Background level
was defined as the average signal of the negative and degradation controls plus two times their standard deviation.
The ratio between intensities of the perfect match probe
and its mismatch probe (referred to as PM/MM) was also

Bioinformatics methods
For small RNA deep sequencing, initial reads of length 33
bases were scanned for the presence of the 5' part of the 3'

allowing 2 mismatches. Raw sequences whose last 9-14
bases represented the first 9-14 bases of the 3' cloning

primer were mapped to the draft genome sequence after
removal of adaptor sequences using the software SOAP
[56]. Whole transcriptome Illumina reads were mapped
to the Vitis vinifera genome using the software SOAP.
Counts of reads mapping to defined genomic loci and all
statistical analyses of cluster densities were performed
using custom scripts written in PYTHON.
For Illumina transcriptome data, we estimate the probability that at least the observed number of reads should be
clustered in the genomic interval defined by the precursor
using the Poisson distribution. Thus, we exclude all reads
mapping to predicted genes, and search for significant
violations (at the 1% confidence interval) of the nullhypothesis that remaining reads should be distributed
randomly among intergenic regions. We consider only
reads mapping uniquely to a single genomic locus. Given
the expected short half-life of most primary miRNA transcripts, we believe that these criteria constitute an
extremely conservative test of precursor expression.

For the genomic regions containing predicted miRNA precursors, we used ad-hoc PYTHON scripts exploiting the
MatPlotLib library to plot, for each base the log of the coverage (normalized to the expected coverage under a null
model of random distribution). Thus only values above
zero reflect higher than expected numbers of transcriptderived matches.
Python scripts were used to generate PSSMs for U2 splice
donors and acceptors (3 exonic bases, 14 intronic bases)
and aggregate log scores were used to assign scores to all
possible canonical splice donors and acceptors. Custom
PYTHON scripts were used to combinatorially generate
putative splice junctions and SOAP was employed to map
RNA-Seq reads that did not provide contiguous perfect
matches to the genome sequence to such junctions.
