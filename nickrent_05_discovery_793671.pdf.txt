Abstract
Background: Although recent molecular phylogenetic studies have identified the photosynthetic
relatives of several enigmatic holoparasitic angiosperms, uncertainty remains for the last parasitic
plant order, Balanophorales, often considered to include two families, Balanophoraceae and
Cynomoriaceae. The nonphotosynthetic (holoparasitic) flowering plant Cynomorium coccineum has
long been known to the Muslim world as "tarthuth" and to Europeans as the "Maltese mushroom";
C. songaricum is known in Chinese medicine as "suo yang." Interest in these plants is increasing and
they are being extensively collected from wild populations for use in herbal medicines.
Results: Here we report molecular phylogenetic analyses of nuclear ribosomal DNA and
mitochondrial matR sequence data that strongly support the independent origin of
Balanophoraceae and Cynomoriaceae. Analyses of single gene and combined gene data sets place
Cynomorium in Saxifragales, possibly near Crassulaceae (stonecrop family). Balanophoraceae appear
related to Santalales (sandalwood order), a position previously suggested from morphological
characters that are often assumed to be convergent.
Conclusion: Our work shows that Cynomorium and Balanophoraceae are not closely related as
indicated in all past and present classifications. Thus, morphological features, such as inflorescences
bearing numerous highly reduced flowers, are convergent and were attained independently by
these two holoparasite lineages. Given the widespread harvest of wild Cynomorium species for
herbal medicines, we here raise conservation concerns and suggest that further molecular
phylogenetic work is needed to identify its photosynthetic relatives. These relatives, which will be
easier to cultivate, should then be examined for phytochemical activity purported to be present in
the more sensitive Cynomorium.

Background
Molecular phylogenetics has expanded understanding of
relationships among all major angiosperm groups and
has thereby strongly impacted their classification [1].
More recently, such advances have also included some
nonphotosynthetic holoparasites whose phylogenetic

positions had previously been uncertain, such as Hydnoraceae [2] and Rafflesiales [3]. The latter study documented that Rafflesiales are actually a polyphyletic
assemblage of three or four independent evolutionary lineages. The losses and reductions in features that are pervasive in parasitic plants have resulted in remarkable

morphological convergences, thereby explaining their
erroneous placement by traditional methods. Previous
molecular phylogenetic work with such holoparasites
highlighted the need to employ gene sequences from different subcellular compartments and analytical methods
that accommodate rate heterogeneity, thus avoiding longbranch attraction artifacts [3]. These steps are justified
because congruence among different gene trees provides
evidence that the organismal tree is being recovered, while
incongruence suggests the presence of nonstandard processes such as introgression, lineage sorting, and horizontal
gene transfer (HGT) [3-6].
In addition to the abovementioned holoparasites,
another group with uncertain placement is Balanophorales. For over 150 years, there has been taxonomic debate
as to whether the genus Cynomorium is part of Balanophoraceae [7,8] or whether it should be classified as a separate
family, Cynomoriaceae [9]. These plants are fleshy, monoecious or dioecious holoparasitic herbs that often produce swollen tuberous haustorial root connections to
their host plants. Their stems bear scalelike leaves and
their unisexual flowers represent the ultimate in reduction
among angiosperms [10] (Figure 1). Balanophoraceae (in
the strict sense) contains 17 genera and 44 species in the
neo- and paleotropics whereas Cynomorium has two species in eastern Asia (C. songaricum) and the Mediterranean
(C. coccineum). The presence of bisexual flowers, an unusual bimodal karyotype [11] and features of the stamens,
ovules, and embryo sac [12] in Cynomorium all support its
segregation from Balanophoraceae. Whether considered
one or two families, all past and present classifications
accept a relationships between Cynomorium and Balanophoraceae. Previous molecular phylogenetic work using
only nuclear small-subunit ribosomal DNA [13] suggested placement of Cynomorium with Saxifragales and
Balanophoraceae with the sandalwood order (Santalales).
The validity of these results could not be assessed because
high substitution rates in these plants could potentially
confound phylogeny estimation [14] and because confirmatory data from other genes was lacking. Here we utilize both nuclear and mitochondrial gene sequence data,
analyzed with maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian
inference (BI) methods, to determine whether Balanophoraceae and Cynomoriaceae are related to one another
and where these clades fit in the global angiosperm
phylogeny.

result as obtained with the global data set. Similarly, mitochondrial matR analyzed alone with BI (Additional File 6)
showed Cynomorium well separated from Balanophoraceae. Moreover, strong support is obtained from multigene and separate gene analyses for a relationship
between Balanophoraceae and Santalales. Given these
results, attempts were made to precisely determine the sister taxon of Cynomorium within Saxifragales, a clade that
has been subjected to extensive molecular phylogenetic
work [15,16]. The shortest MP trees contained a clade
composed of Cynomorium and Crassulaceae (Figure 3),
however, this relationship did not receive high bootstrap
(BS) support. A similar lack of resolution for this clade
was also seen in the BI tree (Additional File 7). On both
the MP and BI trees, Cynomorium is part of a clade with
moderate support that contains Crassulaceae, Paeoniaceae, Aphanopetalaceae, Tetracarpaeaceae, Haloragaceae, Pterostemonaceae, Iteaceae, Grossulariaceae, and
Saxifragaceae.

Discussion
This work documents that Cynomorium and Balanophoraceae are not closely related, a result in conflict with past
and present classifications. Assuming our molecular gene
trees reflect the organismal tree, these data indicate that
morphological features, such as inflorescences bearing
numerous highly reduced flowers, are convergent and
were thus attained independently by these two holoparasite lineages.

Results

Cynomorium in Saxifragales
From an historical perspective, Hooker [7] allied Cynomorium and Balanophoraceae with Haloragaceae (the latter
is a family in Saxifragales, see Figure 3) because both
groups have epigynous flowers with stamens opposite the
valvate perianth lobes. He also noted the striking similarities between the female flowers of Gunnera and Lophophytum (Balanophoraceae). Our analyses that included
Gunnera (data not shown) indicate it is not closely related
to either Cynomoriaceae or Balanophoraceae, a result in
agreement with other work that placed Gunnera as sister to
all core eudicots [17,18]. Other 19th century workers such
as Hoffmeister proposed a relationships between Cynomorium and Hippuris (Plantaginaceae, an asterid) because
both have a single, epigynous stamen attached to the top
of a unicarpellate ovary. This relationship was not confirmed following a detailed floral morphological study
[19] nor was Cynomorium shown to be related to asterids
following molecular analyses reported here.

Results of analyses of of the global data set using both MP
(Figure 2) and BI (Additional File 3) strongly indicate that
Cynomorium is not closely related to Balanophoraceae but
is a component of Saxifragales. Small-subunit (SSU)
nuclear ribosomal DNA alone analyzed with BI (Additional File 4) and ML (Additional File 5) gave the same

The exact position of Saxifragales within the core eudicot
clade remains uncertain because various molecular phylogenetic analyses are in conflict (c. f. [17,18,20,21]).
These studies have proposed relationships with rosids,
asterids, caryophyllids, and Santalales, i.e. nearly all

members of the core tricolpate clade (see review by Judd
and Olmstead [22]). The results reported here also demonstrate uncertainty with regard to the topology of the
above clades (Figure 2). Given the variety of ways these
clades could resolve, the possibility exists that Balanophoraceae and Cynomorium are more closely related than
graphically depicted in Figure 2. Although future molecular phylogenetic studies may support this, it is unlikely
that these two holoparasite groups will become sister
given that the Balanophoraceae + Santalales clade has BS
support of 94% and Cynomorium is sister to Peridiscus with

98% BS support. Moreover, the latter two genera are sister
to Hamamelis with a 98% BS value.
Long-branch attraction has long been suggested as a confounding factor when conducting phylogenetic analyses
of organisms with marked among-lineage rate heterogeneity [23]. Indeed, our group has shown that Rafflesiales,
another holoparasitic angiosperm group, is susceptible to
long-branch attraction, particularly when analyzed with
MP [3]. The results reported here differ from that study in
several respects. First, MP analysis of the global data set

does not indicate that Balanophoraceae and Cynomorium
exhibit particularly long branches with respect to other
angiosperms, nor are these holoparasite clades "attracted"

to each other (Additional File 8). This result differs from
that obtained when the Rafflesiales molecular data are
analyzed with MP where the four distinct lineages (ApoPage 5 of 11
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:38

danthaceae, Cytinaceae, Mitrastemonaceae and Rafflesiaceae) appear monophyletic [3]. When the global data
set is analyzed with BI, some degree of branch length heterogeneity is seen (Additional File 9), however, Balanophoraceae and Cynomorium still remain on distinct clades.
It should be pointed out that for the global data set,
branch length comparisons between holoparasites and
photosynthetic plants are somewhat biased given that the
chloroplast genes were coded as missing for the holoparasites. Taken together, we feel our results are not being
influence by long-branch attraction and that they provide
strong evidence for the independent evolution of these
two holoparasite lineages.
Attempts to find morphological features that link Cynomorium with Saxifragales are complicated, first because the
latter order is morphologically heterogeneous and second
because of morphological reductions in the holoparasite
(see below). The heterogeneity of Saxifragales is evidenced
by the fact that pre-molecular classifications placed many
of its component families in distinct subclasses [8].
Although a close relationship between Cynomorium and
Crassulaceae was not seen on the BI tree, the shortest MP
tree showed these genera as sister taxa, thus this possible
affinity will here be considered. Tricolporate pollen (Figure 1e), stem succulence, and proanthocyanidins (red pigments, see [24]) are possible characters that may reflect a
relationship between Cynomorium and Crassulaceae, but
these are all general features found in many groups. Other
than such facies, there are few floral characters that could
be considered synapomorphies between the extremely
reduced flowers of Cynomorium and those of Crassulaceae.
The staminate flower of Cynomorium is composed of four
to six distinct perianth parts forming a whorl below the
single stamen and a wedge-shaped structure interpreted as
a pistillode [25]. The apical portion of the pistillode is
concave and accepts the base of an anther theca prior to
filament elongation (Figure 1b) and its internal lateral
surface has a groove that accepts the filament. Stamen
morphology is not unlike many tricolpate angiosperms:
the anthers are dorsifixed, tetrasporangiate, dithecal and
open by longitudinal slits. The carpellate flower (Figure
1c) is composed of a single carpel with an elongated,
grooved style. The perianth (or perigonial scales) are
much smaller than in the staminate flower, reduced to
small papillae at the summit of the ovary or along its
sides. The bisexual flowers are similar to carpellate flowers
except for the addition of a stamen at the base of the ovary
(Figure 1d). As with many holoparasitic flowering plants,
the reduction or loss of morphological features interferes
with the comparative morphological approach when
searching for relatives among less modified photosynthetic plants.

Balanophoraceae in Santalales
Although precedents exists for placing Balanophoraceae
with Santalales [8,26-29], recovering this relationship
with both nuclear and mitochondrial genes is surprising
because any morphological similarities (e.g., reduction in
the gynoecium) have usually been assumed to be cases of
convergence [30]. Moreover, BI of the Saxifragales data set
indicates a derivation of Balanophoraceae from within
Santalales, not as its sister (Figure 3 and Additional File 8).
Although a multigene analysis of Santalales with robust
taxon sampling exists [31], it was generated with nuclear
ribosomal DNA and chloroplast genes. To conduct analyses with Balanophoraceae and Santalales, mitochondrial
genes from the latter will be needed to test relationships.

Cronquist [8] viewed the sandalwoods as the best candidate ancestral group for Balanophoraceae, however, he
admitted any similarities might reflect convergent adaptations to parasitism. Of the 17 genera in the family, only
Dactylanthus, Hachettea and Mystropetalon were used in
this study because they are sister (and basal) to the
remaining genera and have lower substitution rates in
SSU rDNA, thus avoiding potential long-branch artifacts.
The floral morphology of Mystropetalon is less reduced
than other genera in the family. Given that its staminate
flowers have pistillodes (vestigial carpels) and carpellate
flowers have staminodes (vestigial stamens), it is assumed
this plesiomorphic condition reflects evolution from an
ancestor with bisexual flowers. Floral features in common
with Santalales include a valvate perianth and stamens
with "typical" morphology (i.e. anther sacs and filaments
as opposed to synangia as seen in Balanophora). When
examining the haustorial structure of Mystropetalon, Weber
[32] noted the presence of a collapsed zone, graniferous
tracheary elements, and "runners," which he associated
with Santalales. Similarly, reduction in ovules is seen in
several santalalean families, particularly the mistletoes in
Viscaceae where no true ovule exists. Either an embryo sac
is embedded within central placenta called a "mamelon"
or the archesporium develops hypodermally in the ovary,
functioning directly as megaspore mother cells [33]. Similarly, ovules have been lost in some Santalaceae (Exocarpos) and Loranthaceae. During the course of floral
reduction, the loss of ovules most influenced Fagerlind
[27] who drew a direct ancestor-descendant relationship
between Santalaceae and Balanophoraceae.
As mentioned above, such apparent similarities between
Balanophoraceae and Santalales have also been
interpreted as convergent. Kuijt [10] suggests that the
reduction of santalalean ovules may permit retention of
meristematic activity, a requirement for the formation of
complex fruits in epiparasites. For root parasites such as
Balanophoraceae, he suggests ovular reduction is related
to selection for tiny seeds that require host stimulants for

germination, as is seen in Orobanchaceae. In addition to
ovules, the androecia of both Viscaceae and Balanophoraceae are diverse with both showing trends toward the formation of synandria and porose dehiscence. Whether
these trends are convergent or follow from homologous
suites of genes may yield to direct testing using floral
homeotic mutants.
Although herbaceous root parasites have evolved in Santalaceae (e.g. Thesium, Quinchamalium), most members of
Santalales are woody. Completely holoparasitic species
do not occur in this order, with the possible exception of
Daenikera, an endemic monotypic genus of New Caledonia whose photosynthetic capabilities remain to be determined. As adults, dwarf mistletoes (Arceuthobium,
Viscaceae) fix only about 30% of the carbon needed for
growth [34,35] but prior to host attachment seedlings
actively photosynthesize. For this reason these mistletoes
must be considered advanced obligate hemiparasites, not
holoparasites. Thus, to include with Santalales the entirely
holoparasitic group Balanophoraceae requires further
investigation to identify the exact sister group.
Ethnobotany and conservation biology of Cynomorium
Cynomorium coccineum, known to the Muslim world as
"tarthuth," has been harvested from the deserts of north
Africa and the Middle East for thousands of years. Arabs
and Bedouins eat the interior portions of fresh young
stems, prepare infusions of older stems to treat colic or
stomach ulcers, or dry and pulverize the plant for use as a
spice or condiment with meat dishes [36]. Medicinal uses
of tarthuth can be traced to Al-Kindi, Al-Razi (Rhazes),
Ibn Masawayh, Ibn Wahshiya, and Maimonides but the
plant became known to Europeans only in the 16th century. A group called the Knights Hospitaller of St. John
operated a hospital in Jerusalem and learned of the medicinal qualities of tarthuth from local Muslim physicians.
When the Crusaders lost Jerusalem to the Muslims, they
moved to the island of Malta where Cynomorium was also
native. The site where the "Maltese Mushroom" grew
(Fungus Rock) was thereafter vigorously guarded and
thieves were imprisoned or made galley slaves. The "treasure of drugs," as the Arabs called it, was used for a variety
of purposes, including treating apoplexy, venereal disease,
high blood pressure, vomiting, irregular menstrual periods and as a contraceptive and toothpaste.

Modern biomedical and phytochemical research on
Cynomorium coccineum has demonstrated a variety of activities from plant extracts. Effects of Cynomorium extracts on
mammalian reproductive cells modulation of pituitary
gonadotrophins [37] as well as changes in testicular development [38] and epididymal sperm patterns [39] in rats.
Cynomorium songaricum, known in Chinese medicine as
"suo yang," has been shown to contain triterpenes with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/38

HIV protease inhibitory activity [40,41]. Interest in herbal
medicines is growing at a rapid pace, and attention has
been focused upon Cynomorium as evidenced by its availability via hundreds of distributors advertising (via the
internet) herbal remedies for kidney and intestinal ailments as well as for impotence. Although it is not at
present clear how many original distributors of the plant
exist, and whether plant material being marketed as
Cynomorium is actually this plant, what is clear is that it is
not being cultivated, thus authentic herbal preparations
must be obtained from wild populations. Very little information exists on the cultivation of Cynomorium [25] and
certainly commercial suppliers are not practicing sustainable harvest by cultivating this obligate holoparasite.
There is evidence that overexploitation of this plant has
resulted in localized extinction [42]. For these reasons, we
here raise concerns for the conservation of both species of
Cynomorium and strongly voice the need to develop cultivation methodologies. Given the potential and actual biomedical applications of extracts from this plant, and
conservation concerns given extensive harvesting from
wild populations, information on its phylogenetic position within angiosperms is timely. Further molecular
work will likely illuminate its closest relatives within Saxifragales. These taxa should then become the subject of
phytochemical analyses to determine whether they also
contain compounds of biomedical interest. Cultivation of
photosynthetic plants would be more straightforward
than the holoparasite, thus possibly relieving some of the
pressure to harvest this more sensitive species from the
wild.

Conclusion
All previous classifications have allied Cynomorium and
Balanophoraceae, likely owing to the holoparasitic habit
and the presence of inflorescences with numerous tiny
flowers. Molecular phylogenetic analyses using nuclear
and mitochondrial gene sequences both indicate that
these taxa are not closely related and that perceived similarities are a result of convergent evolution. Cynomorium is
strongly supported as being a member of Saxifragales,
however, its exact position within this order remains unresolved. Surprisingly, both nuclear and mitochondrial
genes place Balanophoraceae with the sandalwood order,
a relationship previously proposed but explained by some
as a case of convergent evolution. Both species of wild
Cynomorium are being harvested from wild populations
for use in herbal medicines, and evidence exists for overexploitation. Given that methods to cultivate these
holoparasites are not being employed, we here raise
conservation concerns. If further molecular phylogenetic
work identifies the nearest photosynthetic relatives of
Cynomorium, these plants should be examined for phytochemical activity.

§Models selected by the hLRT can vary depending on the model parameter addition hierarchy used; models used for analysis were those chosen by
the AICc and at least one version of the hLRT [for matK pos 1, AICc was used]. The listed numbers of variable characters in the "both global and
Saxifragales" portion of the table refer to the global data set. Akaike weights of the chosen model were computer for the total number of characters
(all) and the number of variable characters (variable). * Both the global and Saxifragales data sets included atpB codon positions 1 and 2, but the
models chosen for these data partitions differed between the two data sets (simpler models were chosen for these partitions with the Saxifragales
data set, which comprises more closely related taxa than does the global data set).

Methods
Taxon sampling and data collection
Voucher information for all newly sequenced taxa is given
in Additional Files 1 and 2. DNA was extracted, PCR
amplified, cloned, and sequenced following reported
methods [3,43]. The nuclear and mitochondrial
sequences were amplified using primers reported elsewhere [14,44,45]. Sequencing was conducted using an
ABI Prism® 377 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Two
multiple sequence alignments were constructed. The purpose of the global data set was to test the position of
Cynomorium and the three Balanophoraceae genera
among angiosperm orders. This matrix included nuclear
small-subunit (SSU) rDNA, chloroplast rbcL and atpB, and
mitochondrial matR for 67 taxa with Laurus and Cinnamomum as outgroups. Balanophoraceae and Cynomorium
lack the chloroplast genes rbcL and atpB, but they were
included in the global data set to stabilize the overall tree
topology as previously demonstrated [2,3]. Given the
strong support for a relationship between Cynomorium
and Saxifragales obtained from this global analysis, a
Saxifragales data set was constructed to further resolve the
position of the parasites within this clade. Here the genes
used were nuclear SSU and LSU rDNA, chloroplast rbcL,

atpB, and matK for 62 taxa with Lea and Vitis as outgroups.
In both alignments, chloroplast genes were coded as missing for the holoparasites. Accession numbers for newly
sequenced genes are: AY957440 – AY957454.
Phylogenetic analyses
The global and Saxifragales data sets were analyzed using
maximum parsimony (MP) in PAUP* 4.0b10 [46] and
Bayesian inference (BI) methods in MrBayes 3.0b4 [47].
MP searches were performed using 100 random addition
sequence replicates with tree-bisection-reconnection
(TBR) branch-swapping, holding ten trees at each addition step, with all sites equally weighted. Fully partitioned
Bayesian analyses were performed by partitioning each
data set by gene and, for the protein-coding genes, by
codon position. This resulted in a total of 10 partitions for
the full data set and 11 partitions for the Saxifragales data
set (Table 1). MP trees were constructed for each gene (following the protocol described above), and these trees
were used in PAUP* to evaluate 24 nucleotide substitution models for each data partition. For example, models
were evaluated for the "rbcL Pos1" partition (the first
codon position of the rbcL data set) on the MP tree for the
rbcL data set. MrModelTest 2.0 [48] was used to select an
appropriate model from the PAUP* output via a second-

order version of the Akaike Information Criterion (AICc)
that takes sample size into account, as recommended by
Posada and Buckley [49]. AICc values were computed
using both the total number of characters and the number
of variable characters per partition. For nearly all partitions, the Akaike weight for the chosen model was much
higher than the Akaike weight of the next best model, so
model-averaged analyses were not performed. The bestfitting models and their Akaike weights for each data partition are listed in Supplementary Data. Partitioned Bayesian analyses were performed with all model parameters
unlinked (i.e., model parameters for each data partition
were estimated separately from each partition), and with
topology and branch lengths linked. Two separate analyses (with different MCMC seeds, random starting trees
and default uniform priors for all parameters) were run
for each data set for 15 million generations, with trees
sampled every 500 generations. Trees recovered during
the first 2.5 million generations (the first 5000 trees) in
both runs were discarded as burn-in, leaving a total of
25,000 trees which were used to construct majority-rule
consensus trees.
