Abstract
Background: It is essential to elucidate the relationship between metabolic and genomic diversity
to understand the genetic regulatory networks associated with the changing metabolo-phenotype
among natural variation and/or populations. Recent innovations in metabolomics technologies
allow us to grasp the comprehensive features of the metabolome. Metabolite quantitative trait
analysis is a key approach for the identification of genetic loci involved in metabolite variation using
segregated populations. Although several attempts have been made to find correlative relationships
between genetic and metabolic diversity among natural populations in various organisms, it is still
unclear whether it is possible to discover such correlations between each metabolite and the
polymorphisms found at each chromosomal location. To assess the correlative relationship
between the metabolic and genomic diversity found in rice accessions, we compared the distance
matrices for these two "omics" patterns in the rice accessions.
Results: We selected 18 accessions from the world rice collection based on their population
structure. To determine the genomic diversity of the rice genome, we genotyped 128 restriction
fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers to calculate the genetic distance among the
accessions. To identify the variations in the metabolic fingerprint, a soluble extract from the seed
grain of each accession was analyzed with one dimensional 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).
We found no correlation between global metabolic diversity and the phylogenetic relationships
among the rice accessions (rs = 0.14) by analyzing the distance matrices (calculated from the pattern
of the metabolic fingerprint in the 4.29- to 0.71-ppm 1H chemical shift) and the genetic distance on
the basis of the RFLP markers. However, local correlation analysis between the distance matrices
(derived from each 0.04-ppm integral region of the 1H chemical shift) against genetic distance
matrices (derived from sets of 3 adjacent markers along each chromosome), generated clear
correlations (rs > 0.4, p < 0.001) at 34 RFLP markers.
Conclusion: This combinatorial approach will be valuable for exploring the correlative
relationships between metabolic and genomic diversity. It will facilitate the elucidation of complex
regulatory networks and those of evolutionary significance in plant metabolic systems.

Background
It is essential to elucidate the relationships between metabolic and genomic diversity to understand the genetic
causes of phenotypic variation among natural populations. Visible and chemical variations associated with
genomic diversity provide the information required to
identify key genes associated with such phenotypic
changes [1]. Patterns of nucleotide polymorphisms and a
population structure figured in a natural population have
allowed us to understand the evolutionary significance of
genetic variation under the influence of geographic factors
or different environments [2,3].
The technical development of metabolite profiling has
provided quantitative phenotypic information on the
metabolome among strains and identified genes involved
in metabolic networks [4]. Therefore, a comprehensive
exploration of the correlations between metabolic and
genomic diversity, achieved by superimposing data from
these two "omics" approaches, could provide information
regarding both the broad and specific relationships
between metabolo-phenotypes and genotypes. This information would aid the identification of genetic associations between the metabolic and/or visible phenotypes
[5,6].
Metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) analysis using
segregated populations has been applied to various plant
species as a popular forward genetics approach [4,5,7-9].
Although mQTLs analysis has been used to dissect the
genetic loci involved in metabolo-phenotypic changes in
mapping populations of various organisms, no methods
have been developed to identify the correlations between
genetic polymorphisms and metabolo-phenotypic differences in divergent accessions or individuals from natural
populations. To date, several attempts have been performed to find correlative relationships between genetic
and metabolic diversity in various organisms [10-13]. It is
still unclear whether it is possible to discover such correlations between each metabolite and the polymorphic
pattern found at each chromosomal location to explain
natural variation. Combinatorial approaches of population genomics coupled with metabolo-phenotyping
should play a significant role in the exploration of the
association of genetic variation with metabolic changes
that have a significant impact on evolution and adaptation [3].
In this study, to assess the correlative relationship
between metabolic and genomic diversity found in 18 rice
accessions selected from the world rice collection, we
compared the distance relationships of accessions for
these two omics patterns, globally, with marker polymorphisms vs. the metabolomic fingerprints of NMR spectra,
as well as locally, for each chromosomal region vs. each

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/568

spectra. To perform these analyses, we developed a robust
procedure to explore the relationship between metabolic
and genomic diversity. As a result, we present the first correlation map of metabolic and genomic diversity among
rice accessions.

Results and Discussion
To select the appropriate rice accessions for the comparison of metabolic profiles with patterns of genetic polymorphisms, we initially investigated the population
structure of the world rice collection. The accessions of the
world rice collection have been classified into three major
groups, japonica, indica I, and indica II [14]. To determine
in greater detail the genetic structure of these populations,
we performed population structure analysis using Structure software on data generated by genotyping 128 restriction-fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) markers.
This analysis showed that the japonica type accessions
were composed of 4 sub-groups; temperate, and tropical
I, II, and III. For the twoindica groups, the members of
indica I were not divided, while those of indica II were
divided into two sub-groups; indica IIa and indica IIb
(Fig. 1). We chose 18 rice accessions from 6 representative
sub-groups to cover a diverse range of cultivated rice populations, on the basis of population structure, to avoid
regional bias (Fig. 1 and Additional file 1).
The RFLP genotyping data were also used to generate global and local genetic distance matrices along each chromosome in combination with physical allocation data on
the rice genome (Additional file 2). Soluble extracts of
seeds from each accession were analyzed by 1D 1Hnuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis to elucidate
the metabolic diversity among the accessions (Fig. 2 and
Additional file 3).
To assess the global correlation between metabolic and
genomic diversity, we calculated Spearman's coefficient of
correlation (rs) between the distance matrices calculated
from the 4.29- to 0.71-ppm 1H chemical shifts and
genetic distance among accessions with polymorphisms
at the 128 RFLP markers. We found no correlation
between global metabolic diversity and the phylogenetic
relationships among the rice accessions (rs = 0.14).
Although the phylogenetic tree of the genetic distance
matrix showed the expected 3 typical clusters (corresponding to japonica, indica I, and indica II; Fig. 3a), the
metabolic diversity tree showed no identifiable clusters
corresponding to the phylogenetic clusters (Fig. 3b). This
result indicates that there are no relationships between the
genomic and metabolic diversity of solution metabolites
of rice grain in the comparison of holistic data. In higher
plants, the diversity of the metabolome might tend to be
unrelated with genomic diversity. In sesame, which has
been an example for the comparison of metabolic and

genomic diversity in higher plants, the relationship patterns generated for the AFLPs and the seed metabolic profiles also differed [10]. Seed metabolic profiles are derived
from the transcriptome that is specifically activated in the
embryo and endosperm during seed development. Genes
involved in the abundance of solution metabolites of rice
seed might consist of small members expressed in seed
specific transcriptome. Although there have been few
examples of the global assessment of correlations between
metabolic and genomic diversity in higher plants, the
recent updating of the infrastructure for population
genomics and metabolomics should allow us to determine correlation patterns at different levels i.e., from
genomic segments to small chromosomal regions in each
organism along with their evolutionary patterns. In Arabidopsis, a large number of metabolic QTLs were identified
in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) of two parental ecotypes, which had been selected from 14 ecotypes based on
their metabolic profiles [15]. Most of the metabolic variation observed among the ecotypes was successfully
mapped using this RIL population, indicating that meta-

bolic variation can be associated with simplified polymorphic patterns at specific chromosomal regions.
We then calculated the rs of Euclidian distance matrices
derived from each 0.04-ppm integral region of the 1H
chemical shift against the genetic distance matrices
derived from sets of three adjacent markers along each
chromosome (Additional file 4). The results of these local
analyses are presented as a 2D correlation map (Fig. 4). To
assess the statistical significance of each correlation coefficient value in this dataset, we calculated the p-value for
each rs value and determined the relationship between the
rs value and the p-value for all combinations. As a result of
this analysis, an rs value of 0.4 was supported with a pvalue of 2.99E-07; the value of rs at the 0.1% level of the
p-value was between â¥ 0.3 and â¤ 0.4. We also calculated
the correlation coefficient values between each genetic
distance matrix of three randomly sampled RFLP markers
and the metabolic profile of each of the 104 NMR spectra
in 10,000 trials to estimate the probability of a high correlation by random chance (Additional file 5). The results

showed that the probability of a correlation coefficient rs
â¥ 0.4 in the randomized data was less than 1% (0.71%).
Therefore, in this analysis, we applied rs = 0.4 as the
threshold to detect correlative combinations between
metabolic and genomic diversity.
The presentation of the correlations as a 2D heat map
showed large non-correlative areas studded with correlative areas, which can be explored in omics-wide comparisons. The heat map showed clear correlations between the
profiles of soluble metabolites and local genomic diversity at each chromosomal location. To identify metabolites, we performed 2D 1H-13C NMR analysis (Additional
file 6, 7 and 8). Diversity in the choline profile (3.2 ppm)
showed a high correlation with genetic diversity around
the R1613 RFLP marker, located at 176.5 cM on chromosome (Chr.) 1 (rs = 0.67, P < 0.01). The lipid methylene
signal (1.22 ppm) showed correlations with polymorphic
sites at multiple chromosomal locations, with the highest
located around the C43 RFLP marker at 92.8 cM on Chr.
5 (rs = 0.66, P < 0.01), and the second highest around
R1943 at 123.7 cM on Chr. 8 (rs = 0.58, P < 0.01). The correlation peaks corresponding to each of the lipids (1.00,
1.16, 1.22, and 1.60 ppm) with Chr. 2 (153.6 and 95.7
cM), Chr. 5 (41.4, 92.8, 103.5, 112.3, and 9.8 cM), and
Chr. 11 (123.3 and 85.8 cM) were in good accordance
with the covalent bond networks within molecules of
each compound. Furthermore, sucrose (3.40, 3.59, and
3.78 ppm) with Chr. 1 (186.8 cM) and Chr. 4 (31.4 cM)
also showed good accordance. Similar intramolecular
covalent bond networks were reported in NMR experiments of biological metabolite mixtures, including covariance total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) analysis of
insect venom [16] and TOCSY analysis of intact human
gut biopsies [17].
Local comparison between the dendrogram based on the
correlative RFLP polymorphisms and NMR spectra
showed a similar tree structure between both genetic and
metabolic variation among the accessions. For example,
the dendrogram of genetic polymorphisms around the
C43 RFLP marker (92.8 cM on Chr. 5) and the diversity of
the lipid methylene signal indicated the genetic and metabolic divergence between indica I and two other groups,
japonica and indica II (Additional file 9).
To display the chromosomal locations of the correlative
regions at 34 RFLP markers, the results of the correlation
analysis were superimposed onto a genetic map of rice
(Additional file 10). This genetic map should allow us to
identify metabolic QTLs associated with each of the metabolic abundances allocated on a genetic map. It would
be beneficial if future genetic analyses narrowed down
candidate genes and/or isolated such metabolic QTLs in
combination with other genomic resources for rice such as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/568

genetic marker systems and genome annotation databases.
Throughout this study, we developed a robust approach
to explore the correlation between genomic and metabolomic diversity observed in natural variation, which is
shown as a schematic flow in additional file 11. The procedure is summarized as follows: (1) selection of appropriate accessions based on population structures; (2)
acquisition of the metabolic profile of selected accessions
using various types of metabolomics platforms and the
calculation of the distance among accessions on the basis
of metabolite abundance or spectrum intensities; (3) genotyping of selected accessions using DNA markers covering the whole genome and the calculation of local genetic
distance among accessions from genotype data of adjacent marker sets; (4) to discover the correlative relationships between each metabolite and chromosomal region
and the coefficients of correlation for metabolic and
genetic distances in all-against-all combinations and to
display their distribution on a genetic map. In this analysis of rice, we did not find a correlation between metabolic
and genomic diversity as observed in previously reported
studies. On the other hand, local correlation analysis
allowed us to identify small correlative areas mostly in
non-correlative spaces. This suggests that local correlation
analysis could be an effective method to discover such correlative areas allocated to chromosomal regions together
with linkage maps or variation data of genomic sequences
[18,19].
This study illustrated a new integrative approach to
explore the links between metabolomics and genomics.
The procedure could be extended to a higher resolution by
using denser polymorphic marker maps in various species.

Conclusion
This study assessed the correlative relationships between
genetic and metabolic diversity among rice accessions.
The data presents the first correlative relationship for the
chromosomal distribution of each metabolic profile in
rice. The combinatorial use of genomic and metabolomic
data demonstrated here should facilitate the elucidation
of complex regulatory networks and those of evolutionary
significance in plant metabolic systems.

Methods
Rice seed materials
The rice accessions were chosen from the RFLP-based Rice
Discovery Research Set of rice germplasms, which contains 68 rice accessions and is developed and maintained
by Genebank http://www.gene.affrc.go.jp/about_en.php
at the National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences
(NIAS). The accessions were classified into three major

Page 7 of 10

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:568

groups by principal components analysis (PCA) of the
RFLP data: japonica, indica I, and indica II [14]. Population structure analysis using Structure software (v. 2.1,
http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu/software/
structure2_1.html) was also conducted on the world rice
collection to determine the population structure in more
detail, especially for the japonica type [20,21]. Based on
the results of the PCA and Structure analyses we selected
nine accessions each of japonica (temperate, tropical I, II,
and III) and indica (indica I and indica II) to be included
in the correlation analysis between genetic and metabolomic diversity.
RFLP genotyping and phylogenetic analysis of rice
accessions
We used 128 RFLP markers to evaluate the genetic diversity of the 18 accessions by the Southern hybridization
method of Kojima et al. (2005). Each of the marker alleles
was scored as Nipponbare-type (1), Kasalath-type (2), or
other types (3-7) (Additional file 3), and the presence or
absence of each allele was recorded. The genetic distances
between the 18 rice accessions were calculated with the
"restdist" program of the PHYLIP (v. 3.67) package http:/
/evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html;
we
used the distance matrix to calculate the coefficients of
correlation with the metabolic diversity matrix and to calculate a phylogenetic tree by the UPGMA method using
the "neighbor" program of PHYLIP. The physical position
of each RFLP marker was retrieved from the Rice Annotation
Project
Database
(RAP-DB)
http://
rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/[19].
NMR spectroscopy and quantitative analysis
We prepared NMR samples from rice seeds, as previously
described [22,23] with slight modifications. All 1D Watergate [24] spectra were acquired at 298 K on a Bruker
Avance DRX 500 NMR spectrometer operating at 500.13
MHz and equipped with a 1H inverse triple-resonance
probe with triple-axis gradients.

The 1D NMR spectra were integrated between 0.0 and
10.0 ppm over a series of 0.04-ppm regions by our custom
integration software [25]. After exclusion of the water and
DSS
(2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate)
resonances, each integral region was normalized to the total
integral region (Additional file 2). The data were analyzed
by a partial least-squares projection, based on the spectral
bins obtained from 1D spectral analysis and by using a
hierarchical clustering analysis package running on R software.
Correlation display of genetic and metabolic variation
A Euclidian distance matrix based on the 0.04-ppm integral regions of the chemical shift from 0.708 to 4.292
ppm (104 bins) in the 1D NMR spectra was calculated by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/568

using the "dist" command of the R package. Genetic diversity among the 18 rice accessions was calculated from the
genotype data of all alleles of the 128 scored RFLP markers. To assess the correlation between genome- and
metabolome-wide diversity among the 18 accessions, we
calculated Spearman's coefficient of correlation between
the genetic and Euclidian distance matrices. Local metabolic diversity among the 18 accessions was calculated as
a Euclidian distance matrix in each of the 104 bins. Local
genomic diversity was also calculated as a genetic distance
matrix using sliding bins that included three adjacent
RFLP markers along each rice chromosome. To explore
the local correlations between genomic and metabolic
diversity, we calculated Spearman's rs and p-values for all
combinations of the local metabolic and genomic distance matrices using the "cor.test" program of the R package (Additional file 4). An RFLP map with correlative
chromosomal positions was generated with MapChart
ver. 2.2 [26].
Annotation of candidate metabolites by 2D NMR of 13Clabelled rice seeds
13C-labelled rice extracts were prepared as previously
described methods with minor modifications [27,28]. In
brief, seeds were powdered, 20 mg of which was suspended in 600 Î¼L standard buffer (100 mM potassium
phosphate, pH 7.0, and 1.0 mM 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate in D2O), heated at 65Â°C for 15 min, and
centrifuged at 12,000 Ã g for 5 min. The supernatant (500
Î¼L) was decanted into a 5 mm diameter NMR tube.

Two-dimensional (2D) heteronuclear single quantum
coherence (HSQC) [29] spectra were recorded on a Bruker
Avance 500 spectrometer equipped with an inverse triple
resonance CryoProbe with a Z-axis gradient, operating at
500.13 MHz for 1H frequency (176.061 MHz for 13C frequency), and the temperature of the NMR samples was
maintained at 298 K. A total of 128 complex f1 (13C) and
1024 complex f2 (1H) points were recorded with 96 scans
per f1 increment, resulting in a total recording time of
about 6 h. The spectral window and offset frequency in
the f1 dimension were 7042.593 Hz (40 ppm) and
11971.59 Hz (68 ppm), respectively. The spectral window
in the f2 dimension was 11160.7 Hz (16 ppm). The offset
frequency in the f2 dimension was 3330 Hz (4.75 ppm).
The 2D HSQC spectra of the 13C-labelled rice samples
were processed using the NMRPipe software package [30].
To quantify the signal intensities, a Lorentzian-to-Gaussian window with a Lorentzian line width of 10 Hz and a
Gaussian line width of 15 Hz was applied in both dimensions before Fourier transformation. An automatic polynomial baseline correction was subsequently applied in
the f1 dimension. The indirect dimension was zero-filled
to 4096 points in the final data matrix. Cross peaks of

each metabolite were matched to our standard 1H/13C
chemical shift database [31]. The database is implemented with an in-house Java program, which allows for
the systematic batch identification of large numbers of
metabolites by simply matching the observed 13C-HSQC
peaks with peaks in the database. Our chemical shift data
are continuously updated and are available on the PRIMe
website http://prime.psc.riken.jp/[32]. The queried peaks
were classified as annotated on the basis of whether the
chemical shift difference in each dimension between the
observed peak and the peak in the database was less than
a specified tolerance value. Typically, tolerances of 0.03
ppm for 1H and 0.53 ppm for 13C were used in this study
(Additional file 8). From these candidate metabolites, an
identification or assignment was defined as unique if
there was only one candidate in the database within the
specified tolerances for an observed peak (Additional file
6).
