Genetic variation of g-tocopherol
methyltransferase gene contributes to elevated
a-tocopherol content in soybean seeds
Maria S Dwiyanti, Tetsuya Yamada*, Masako Sato, Jun Abe and Keisuke Kitamura

Abstract
Background: Improvement of a-tocopherol content is an important breeding aim to increase the nutritional value
of crops. Several efforts have been conducted to improve the a-tocopherol content in soybean [Glycine max (L.)
Merr.] through transgenic technology by overexpressing genes related to a-tocopherol biosynthesis or through
changes to crop management practices. Varieties with high a-tocopherol content have been identified in soybean
germplasms. The heritability of this trait has been characterized in a cross between high a-tocopherol variety
Keszthelyi Aproszemu Sarga (KAS) and low a-tocopherol variety Ichihime. In this study, the genetic mechanism of
the high a-tocopherol content trait of KAS was elucidated.
Results: Through QTL analysis and fine mapping in populations from a cross between KAS and a Japanese variety
Ichihime, we identified g-TMT3, which encodes g-tocopherol methyltransferase, as a candidate gene responsible for
high a-tocopherol concentration in KAS. Several nucleotide polymorphisms including two nonsynonymous
mutations were found in the coding region of g-TMT3 between Ichihime and KAS, but none of which was
responsible for the difference in a-tocopherol concentration. Therefore, we focused on transcriptional regulation of
g-TMT3 in developing seeds and leaves. An F5 line that was heterozygous for the region containing g-TMT3 was
self-pollinated. From among the progeny, plants that were homozygous at the g-TMT3 locus were chosen for
further evaluation. The expression level of g-TMT3 was higher both in developing seeds and leaves of plants
homozygous for the g-TMT3 allele from KAS. The higher expression level was closely correlated with high atocopherol content in developing seeds. We generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants harboring GUS gene under
the control of g-TMT3 promoter from KAS or Ichihime. The GUS activity assay showed that the activity of g-TMT3
promoter from KAS was higher than that of Ichihime.
Conclusions: The genetic variation in g-TMT3, which plays a major role in determining a-tocopherol concentration,
provides significant information about the regulation of tocopherol biosynthesis in soybean seeds. This knowledge
will help breeding programs to develop new soybean varieties with high a-tocopherol content.

Background
The vitamin E family comprises tocopherols (a, b, g, and
δ forms) and tocotrienols (a, b, g, and δ forms). All isoforms possess lipid antioxidant activity, and a-tocopherol possesses the highest vitamin E activity in
mammals [1,2]. Vitamin E is widely used as an antioxidant in foods and oils, as a nutrient additive in poultry
and cattle feeds to improve meat quality, and as a supplement in the human diet to help prevent diseases

such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The market
size is expected to grow because of the increasing interest in functional food and increasing demand for meat
products. About 85% of commercial vitamin E is synthesized by chemical reaction [3]. This vitamin E usually
includes the naturally occurring RRR-a-tocopherol and
7-stereoisomers as secondary products, whose biological
activity is only 50%-74% of that of the natural a-tocopherol [4]. Thus, it is very important to increase natural
vitamin E production in crops and vegetables [2].
Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is one of the major
crops for food, oil, and animal feed. In seed processing,

tocopherols are extracted together with the oil fraction.
The tocopherol content is only about 1.5% of the oil;
nevertheless, tocopherols are critical for oxidative stability [5]. Since tocopherols contribute to both the nutritional value of seeds and the oxidative stability of
soybean oil, enhancing tocopherol content in soybean
will improve its market value. In common soybean cultivars, the main forms of seed tocopherols are g-tocopherol and δ-tocopherol, which account for 60% to 70%
and 20% to 25% of the total tocopherol, respectively.
The proportion of a-tocopherol is usually less than 10%
of total tocopherol in soybean seeds [1,6,7]. There have
been some efforts to improve soybean vitamin E
through genetic engineering. The Arabidopsis VTE4
gene encodes g-tocopherol methyltransferase (g-TMT),
which catalyzes the last step of a-tocopherol biosynthesis (Figure 1); overexpression of VTE4 in soybean seeds
resulted in a-tocopherol elevation to 75% of total tocopherol. When VTE4 was coexpressed with VTE3, which
encodes methyl-6-phytyl-1,4-benzoquinol (MPBQ)-

Figure 1 Tocopherol biosynthetic pathway in higher plants.
Tocopherols consist of a polar chromanol ring and a lipophilic
prenyl chain derived from homogentisic acid and phytyl
diphosphate. The shikimate pathway produces the homogentisic
acid, whereas the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP)
pathway produces phytyl diphosphate. Phytyl transferase (HPT)
catalyzes the reaction of phytyl diphosphate addition to
homogentisic acid, producing the common precursor of the
tocopherol biosynthetic pathway, methyl-6-phytyl-1,4-benzoquinone
(MPBQ). MPBQ-methyltransferase (MPBQ-MT) adds a methyl alkyl to
MPBQ, to produce 2,3-dimethyl-6-phytyl-plastoquinol (DMPBQ).
MPBQ and DMPBQ are cyclized by tocopherol cyclase (TC) to form
δ-tocopherol and g-tocopherol, respectively. The last step of
tocopherol biosynthesis is methylation of δ-tocopherol and gtocopherol, which produces b-tocopherol and a-tocopherol,
respectively. These reactions are catalyzed by g-tocopherol
methyltransferase (g-TMT).

methyltransferase (Figure 1), a-tocopherol increased to
more than 95% of total tocopherol, and vitamin E activity increased to up to five times the level in nontransgenic soybean [6]. Meanwhile, overexpression of Perilla
frutescens g-TMT alone increased a-tocopherol to more
than 90% of total tocopherol [8]. Several studies have
suggested the importance of other tocopherol forms.
For example, g-tocopherol may prevent inflammation or
improve kidney function, which are distinct from its
antioxidant activity [9,10]. These studies triggered us to
look for natural tocopherol variants, which may have
unique characteristics. Such variants may make it possible to breed soybean cultivars with a wide range of atocopherol (from 10% to 90% of total tocopherol), and
to develop soybean cultivars tailor-made for certain
purposes.
Tocopherols are present in leaves, stems, flower petals,
and seeds of higher plants and green algae [1,11]. While
a-tocopherol is usually the predominant form in leaves,
there are diverse variations of tocopherol composition in
seeds [1]. For example, in soybean, rapeseed (Brassica
napus), and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), most of
the tocopherols are g-tocopherol or δ-tocopherol; in
sunflower (Helianthus annuus) and safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) seeds, the content of a-tocopherol is
more than 95% of the total tocopherol content [12,13].
Variations in a-tocopherol content (a-tocopherol weight
[μg] per 100 mg seed powder) and concentration (atocopherol as a percentage of total tocopherol) have
been reported in crops such as maize (from 0.9 to 6.5
μg 100 mg-1), sunflower (>95% in wild type and <10% in
mutants), safflower (>85% in wild type and <15% in
mutants), rapeseed (a/g-tocopherol ratio ranged from
0.54 to 1.70) and in the model plant Arabidopsis
[12-16]. Previous studies have shown that variation is
also present in soybean. Three soybean varieties with atocopherol concentration of 20% to 30%, Keszthelyi
Aproszemu Sarga (KAS), Dobrogeance, and Dobrudza
14 Pancevo, were identified through analysis of more
than 1,000 cultivars and varieties from soybean germplasms collections [7]. These varieties showed higher atocopherol content compared to typical cultivars over
two planting years, indicating that high a-tocopherol
content was a stable trait [7]. QTL analysis using Chinese (Hefeng 25) and Canadian (OAC Bayfield) soybean
varieties revealed four QTLs for tocopherol content in
linkage groups B2, C2, D1b, and I, which correspond to
chromosome 14, 6, 2, and 20, respectively. However, the
causal genes involved in these QTLs are yet to be identified [17].
In our previous study, the genetic characteristics of
the high a-tocopherol concentration trait were evaluated
in an F2 population derived from a cross between KAS
and a typical variety, Ichihime [18]. a-Tocopherol

Dwiyanti et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:152

concentration of a typical variety is less than 10% of
total tocopherol [6]. Here and in our previous study
[18], a-tocopherol concentration was defined as the
ratio of a-tocopherol to total tocopherol, whereas atocopherol content was defined as the a-tocopherol
weight (μg) per 100 mg soybean seed powder. The
broad-sense heritability of the high a-tocopherol concentration trait was estimated to be 0.645 [18]. Two
simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers, Sat_167 and
Sat_243 on linkage groupK (chromosome 9) were
strongly correlated with a-tocopherol concentration
[18]. The relationships between tocopherol forms were
also analyzed; a-tocopherol concentration had no significant correlation with total tocopherol content, whereas
g-tocopherol and a-tocopherol concentrations showed a
strong negative correlation [18].
The strong negative correlation between a-tocopherol
concentration and g-tocopherol concentration suggested
that a major gene involved in the biosynthesis pathway
of a-tocopherol might be responsible for the trait [18].
Tocopherols are biosynthesized from two precursors,
homogentisic acid (HGA) and phytyl diphosphate. The
two precursors are condensed by HGA phytyl transferase, generating MPBQ. MPBQ is methylated to become
2,3-dimethyl-6-phytyl-1,4-benzoquinol (DMPBQ).
MPBQ and DMPBQ are converted by tocopherol
cyclase to δ-tocopherol and g-tocopherol, respectively.
The last step of the tocopherol biosynthesis pathway is
methylation of δ-tocopherol and g-tocopherol by g-tocopherol methyltransferase (g-TMT), yielding b-tocopherol
and a-tocopherol, respectively (Figure 1) [1].
To elucidate the genetic basis of the high a-tocopherol concentration trait in KAS, we performed QTL
analysis and fine mapping for a-tocopherol concentration by using the population derived from a cross
between a typical variety Ichihime and the high a-tocopherol variety KAS. The g-TMT3, which has high similarity to the Arabidopsis VTE4 gene, was located within
a QTL region of approximately 75 kb. The expression
level of g-TMT3 was higher in developing seeds of
plants with the KAS genotype, and the expression elevation was correlated with an increase in a-tocopherol
content. It is also demonstrated that the transient activity of g-TMT3 promoter from KAS was higher than that
of Ichihime.

Results
Mapping the QTL responsible for the high a-tocopherol
concentration trait

KAS, a soybean variety with 20% to 30% a-tocopherol
concentration, was crossed to the Japanese cultivar Ichihime (a-tocopherol concentration <10%) to obtain a
segregating population consisting of 122 F2 plants [18].
These plants were grown in the Hokkaido University

Page 3 of 17

greenhouse, where F 3 seeds of each F 2 plant were
obtained and analyzed for their tocopherol composition.
A molecular linkage map was constructed using 152
SSR markers that were polymorphic between Ichihime
and KAS. The linkage map covered 3401 cM of the soybean genome and consisted of 20 linkage groups that
corresponded to the 20 pairs of soybean chromosomes.
Two population groups were used for QTL analysis.
The first population (hereafter, “F 2 seed population”)
consisted of F2 seeds from the Ichihime × KAS cross; in
this population, tocopherol concentrations were analyzed using the half-seed method (see Materials and
Methods). The second population ("F 2 plant population”) consisted of F2 plants whose tocopherol content
and concentration were evaluated by testing the F2:3
seeds. Multiple QTL Mapping (MQM) analysis was performed using MapQTL5, and the QTL threshold values
were determined for each trait by using a 1,000-permutation test [19].
For a-tocopherol concentration, only one QTL was
detected. The QTL was located on a linkage group K
(chromosome 9). MQM analysis revealed that an interval between Sat_243 and KSC138-17 had a strong correlation with a-tocopherol concentration, with LOD value
23.4 and phenotypic variation explained (PVE) by this
QTL of 55.8% (Figure 2, Table 1). In our previous study
[18], there was a strong correlation between a-tocopherol concentration and g-tocopherol concentration.
Therefore, the QTL analysis was conducted not only for
a-tocopherol but also for g-tocopherol and δ-tocopherol.
This was done to elucidate the relationship among tocopherol isoforms and to identify the gene(s) that determine tocopherol composition. From MQM mapping,
the QTL located in an interval between Sat_243 and
KSC138-17 was also associated with g-tocopherol concentration (LOD = 11.5, PVE = 32.8%) and δ-tocopherol
concentration (LOD = 5.0, PVE = 16.1%).
For the F2 plant population, QTLs for tocopherol concentrations and contents were analyzed. The same QTL
observed in the analysis of the F2 seed population was
also detected for a-tocopherol concentration (LOD =
20.2, PVE = 55.0%), g-tocopherol concentration (LOD =
16.7, PVE = 48.7%), and δ-tocopherol concentration
(LOD = 4.8, PVE = 17.0%). Moreover, this QTL was
also responsible for a-tocopherol content (LOD = 20.6,
PVE = 56.5%) and g-tocopherol content (LOD = 5.24,
PVE = 17.9%). For δ-tocopherol concentration, another
QTL was detected in interval Sat_244 and Sat_033 of
linkage group M (chromosome 12), with LOD value
5.26 and PVE 22.5%. However, this QTL was not
detected in F2 seeds analysis.
It has been reported that four QTLs for tocopherol
concentrations and contents were detected from QTL
analysis in a segregating population derived from a cross

regions. This fact suggests that the genetic factor
responsible for high a-tocopherol concentration in KAS
may be different from that in OAC Bayfield.

respectively.

To identify the candidate gene on chromosome 9, fine
mapping was performed in the QTL region flanked by
the Sat_243 and KSC138-17 markers using F5 lines. The
F5 lines were derived from the F2 plants using single seed
descent method. The frequency distribution of a-tocopherol concentration in F 5 lines is shown in Figure 3.
The a-tocopherol concentration was nearly co-segregated with genotypes of KSC138-17 marker (Figure 3). F5
lines showing recombination in the region between
Sat_243 and KSC138-17 were genotyped for newly developed SSR markers located between Sat_243 and KSC13817 (Figure 4A). The fine mapping showed that the candidate gene contributing to high a-tocopherol concentration in KAS was likely located in the region between
KSC138-10 and KSC138-9, which corresponded to
approximately 75 kb of genomic sequence (Figure 4A).
Based on soybean genome information in the Phytozome database [20], there were 10 predicted genes
located in the QTL region between KSC138-10 and
KSC138-9 on chromosome 9 (Table 2, Figure 4A). One
of them, Glyma09g35680.1, shared 81.8% peptide similarity with g-TMT encoding gene in Arabidopsis, VTE4
[21]. In silico analysis further revealed that two additional genes encoding g-TMT exist in the soybean genome: Glyma12g01680.1 and Glyma12g01690.1. Their

predicted polypeptides similarity to VTE4 was 81.4% and
68.9%, respectively, and both genes were located in tandem on linkage group H (chromosome 12), separated by
4 kb genomic sequence. Interestingly, two g-TMT genes
located in tandem were known to regulate a-tocopherol
biosynthesis in sunflower [13]. However, no QTL for atocopherol biosynthesis has been found at linkage group
H located in tandem with Glyma12g01680.1 and Glyma12g01690.1 in soybean. According to the genome
information of database Phytozome [20], there is no the
conserved synteny between the genomic regions surrounding Glyma12g01680.1 and Glyma12g01690.1, and
Glyma09g35680.1. However, in this study, we were
unable to determine whether these regions were homeologous to each other or not.
Glyma12g01680.1 and Glyma12g01690.1 were identical to genomic sequences (g-TMT1 and g-TMT2, respectively) obtained from Ichihime (Ujiie, unpublished data).
Therefore, Glyma12g01680.1 and Glyma12g01690.1
were designated as g-TMT1 and g-TMT2, respectively.
Glyma09g35680.1 was designated as g-TMT3. Based on
predicted amino acid composition, the three g-TMTs
were classified into one phylogenetic group, which is a
part of a cluster of g-TMTs found in dicots (Figure 5).
Except for the N-terminal region, the three g-TMTs
from soybean share high amino acid similarity with gTMTs found in several other plant species (Figure 6).
The plastid is known as a site for a-tocopherol biosynthesis [11], therefore the existence of plastid transit
peptide signals in the three g-TMT proteins using a prediction program of the subcellular localization was
searched. As a result of ChloroP analysis, a plastid transit peptide was predicted in g-TMT2, but not in gTMT1 or g-TMT3 (Figure 6).
In this study, QTLs responsible for a-tocopherol concentration and g-tocopherol concentration were detected
at the same location (linkage group K), strongly supporting the negative correlation between a-tocopherol
concentration and g-tocopherol concentration described

in the previous report [18]. On the basis of the biosynthetic pathway of tocopherol (Figure 1), g-TMT plays a
pivotal role in determining the relative concentrations of
a-tocopherol and g-tocopherol. Therefore, we focused
on characterization of the g-TMT3 gene. According to
the Phytozome database, g-TMT3 is 4.3 kb long and
consists of six predicted exons. An approximately 5.5 kb
genomic region containing the entire sequence of gTMT3 gene and its 5’-upstream region was sequenced
in both Ichihime and KAS. A total of 26 nucleotide
polymorphisms were detected in both exons and introns
(Figure 4B). Two nucleotide substitutions in the exons

Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of g-TMT1, gTMT2, and g-TMT3 from soybean with g-TMTs of plants, green algae
and cyanobacteria. GenBank accession numbers are shown in
parentheses. An unrooted tree based on amino acid sequence
similarity was obtained by using the neighbor joining method.
Bootstrapping was performed with 1,000 replicates, and the
bootstrap values (percent) are indicated above the supported
branches. The scale bar indicates the distance corresponding to 5
changes per 100 amino acid positions. The predicted protein
sequences were initially clustered by using ClustalW.

Figure 6 Amino acid sequence alignment of g-TMT proteins. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of g-TMT1, g-TMT2, and gTMT3 with those of other plants green algae and cyanobacterium. For B. napus (EU637012.1) and H. annuus (DQ229832.1), only one of the
sequences was used for alignment. The sequences were compared with A. thaliana g-TMT (VTE4) as a standard; identical residues in other
sequences are shaded, and gaps introduced for alignment purposes are indicated by dashes (-). Lines under amino acid sequences represented
plastid transit peptides, which were predicted by using ChloroP1.1 [37]. Blocks surrounded by black boxes are conserved SAM-binding domains,
as reported by Shintani and DellaPenna [21].

Ordinary cultivars (Williams 82, Ichihime, and Toyokomachi) and high atocopherol cultivars (KAS, Dobrogeance, Dobrudza 14 Pancevo) were used for
analysis. Polymorphisms in exons are depicted by *1, *2, *3, *4 (see Figure.4B).

led to amino acid alterations. They seemed not to be
nucleotide polymorphisms involved in the high a-tocopherol concentration, because Williams 82 which possessed identical nucleotides to KAS at these two positions
showed low a-tocopherol concentration same as that of
Ichihime (Table 3). Therefore, the 5’-upstream regions
from the transcription initiation site of g-TMT3 between
high a-tocopherol and typical soybeans were compared.
Approximately 1.2 kb of the 5’-upstream region was
sequenced in six varieties with high a-tocopherol concentration (KAS, Dobrogeance, and Dobrudza 14 Pancevo)
and typical varieties (Ichihime, Toyokomachi, and Williams 82). Sequences alignment revealed that 10 singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were observed between
the two groups. Of these, two SNPs were located in gene
transcriptional regulation domains: a MYB binding site
and a CAAT box at positions -612 and -46, respectively,
from the predicted transcriptional start site of Williams 82
(Figure 7). The motif of the CAAT box in high a-tocopherol soybeans was “CAAAT”, whereas the motif in typical soybeans was “CCAAT”. “CCAAT” is the canonical
sequence of the CAAT box, but the “CAAAT” motif is
also recognized as a CAAT box motif in mammals [22,23].
On the other hand, the MYB binding site ("CTGTTA”)
was observed only in high a-tocopherol soybeans. The
motif is recognized by MYB transcription factors in maize
and Arabidopsis [24].
Relationship between a-tocopherol concentration and
expression levels of g-TMT genes

The expression level of g-TMT3 could affect a-tocopherol content and concentration was investigated
because the polymorphisms correlated to a-tocopherol
concentration were found in the transcriptional regulatory domain of g-TMT3.

Figure 7 Predicted transcription factor binding motifs in 5’upstream sequence of g-TMT3. The 5’-upstream sequence of gTMT3 was isolated from high a-tocopherol soybeans (KAS,
Dobrogeance, and Dobrudza 14 Pancevo [Pancevo]), and typical
cultivars (Williams 82, Ichihime, and Toyokomachi). Cis-element
motifs were predicted by using the PLACE [39] and PLANTCARE
databases [40]. Only motifs where nucleotide polymorphisms occur
are shown. CAAT: common cis-acting and enhancer; MYB: binding
site for MYB transcription factor. ATG surrounded by green box
indicates translation start site. +1 indicates transcriptional start site
(TSS). Numbers above the nucleotides refer to the distance from the
TSS. Vertical rows of dots represent promoter regions not shown in
the figure.

surrounding g-TMT3 and homozygous throughout
almost entire genome was used to generate plants
homozygous for the g-TMT3 genomic region from Ichihime and that from KAS; these are referred to as Ichihime lines and KAS lines, respectively. Three lines
homozygous for the Ichihime allele (F5-24-10, F5-24-14,
and F5-24-15) and three lines homozygous for the KAS
allele (F5-24-7, F5-24-18, and F5-24-22) were generated.
From each plant, developing seeds were collected at 30,
40, and 50 days after flowering (DAF).
As shown in Figure 8A, a-tocopherol concentration
increased toward seed maturation. At all developmental
stages, the a-tocopherol concentration was significantly
higher in the KAS lines than in the Ichihime lines (P <
0.05). In 30-DAF seeds, a-tocopherol concentration in
the KAS lines was 1.2 to 2.4 times that of the Ichihime
lines. The difference between the Ichihime lines and the
KAS lines was greater toward seed maturation. At 50
DAF, the a-tocopherol concentration of KAS lines was
up to three times that of the Ichihime lines. There was
no significant difference (P < 0.05) in g-tocopherol concentration between the Ichihime lines and the KAS lines
(Figure 8B). Compared to other tocopherol forms, δtocopherol concentration in the KAS lines was

for either the Ichihime allele for g-TMT3 (F5-24-10, F5-24-14, and F524-15; yellow bars) or the KAS allele for g-TMT3 (F5-24-7, F5-24-18,
and F5-24-22; blue bars) were used for analysis. Seeds were analyzed
at 30 days after flowering (DAF), 40 DAF, and 50 DAF. The
concentrations of a-tocopherol (A), g-tocopherol (B), and δtocopherol (C) were calculated as the percentage of the tocopherol
isoform in total tocopherol content. Data are represented as mean
± SD of the values obtained from triplicate experiments. For each
developmental stage, significant differences between the Ichihime
genotype group and the KAS genotype group (confidence interval

at 40 and 50 DAF (Figure 8C).
a-Tocopherol content in the KAS lines was significantly higher than that of the Ichihime lines at all seed
developmental stages (Figure 9A), and the difference

was the greatest at 50 DAF, showing the same tendency
as a-tocopherol concentration. In contrast, total tocopherol content did not show significant (P < 0.05)
change during seed maturation (Figure 9B). It is concluded from these results that the a-tocopherol concentration increase resulted mainly from the increase in atocopherol content. Among the other tocopherol forms,
g-tocopherol decreased slightly toward seed maturation,
whereas δ-tocopherol content increased until 40 DAF
then decreased toward maturation (Figure 9C and 9D).
A significant difference (P < 0.05) between the KAS
lines and the Ichihime lines was observed for δ-tocopherol content at 40 DAF stage, and a slight but not significant difference (P < 0.05) between KAS lines and
Ichihime lines was also observed for δ-tocopherol content at 50 DAF stage. No significant difference (P <
0.05) was observed for g-tocopherol content at any
developmental stage (Figure 9C).
The expression levels of g-TMT1, g-TMT2 and gTMT3 were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR at three
seed developmental stages (Figure 10). The expression
level was normalized based on the expression of a reference gene, 18S rRNA which was given as a proper reference gene in a gene expression analysis [26]. The
expression of all three g-TMT genes reached the highest
level at 40 DAF, when seed size reached the maximum.
g-TMT1 and g-TMT2 showed no difference (P < 0.05)
in expression level between the Ichihime lines and the
KAS lines. g-TMT3 showed significant differences (P <
0.05) in expression between the Ichihime lines and the
KAS lines at both 30 and 40 DAF. The expression level
of g-TMT3 in the KAS lines was 1.5 to 3 times that of
the Ichihime lines at 30 and 40 DAF (P < 0.05). Expression levels of g-TMT1, g-TMT2, and g-TMT3 were also
analyzed in fully expanded leaves of Ichihime and KAS.
Interestingly, the transcriptional level of g-TMT3 in KAS
leaves was also higher than that in Ichihime leaves, the
same pattern as was observed in developing seeds (Figure 11).
Activity of g-TMT3 promoter of Ichihime and KAS

Since the expression level of g-TMT3 was different in
leaves as well as in developing seeds (Figure 11), we
measured the transient activities of g-TMT3 promoters
in transgenic Arabidopsis leaves expressing GUS reporter gene under the control of g-TMT3 promoter from
KAS or Ichihime. The GUS activity of 10 T2 plants carrying the g-TMT3 promoter from Ichihime and 11 T2
plants carrying the g-TMT3 promoter from KAS were
shown in Figure 12A and 12B. Mean of the GUS activity
in transformants carrying g-TMT3 promoter of KAS was
385.5 pmol 4-MU min-1 mg-1 protein, whereas the mean
in transformants with Ichihime promoter was 100.53

Ichihime allele for g-TMT3 (F5-24-10, F5-24-14, and F5-24-15; yellow bars) or the KAS allele for g-TMT3 (F5-24-7, F5-24-18, and F5-24-22; blue bars)
were used for analysis. Seeds were analyzed at 30 days after flowering (DAF), 40 DAF, and 50 DAF. The contents of a-tocopherol (A), total
tocopherol (B), g-tocopherol (C), and δ-tocopherol (D) were calculated as the weight per 100 milligram dry weight of seed. Data are represented
as mean ± SD of the values obtained from triplicate experiments. For each development stage, significant differences between the Ichihime
genotype group and the KAS genotype group (confidence interval 95%) are shown with asterisks.

transformed data showed that the activity of g-TMT3
promoter of KAS was significantly higher than that of
Ichihime promoter (F = 7.170, P = 0.015).

Discussion
g-TMT3 is the candidate gene for high a-tocopherol
concentration in KAS

In the previous study, two SSR markers, Sat_243 and
Sat_167 on a linkage group K (chromosome 9) were
strongly associated with a-tocopherol concentration. In
this study, we confirmed that the QTL in interval
Sat_243 and KSC138-17 was associated with a-tocopherol concentration, g-tocopherol concentration, atocopherol content, and g-tocopherol content. The QTL

positively regulated a-tocopherol concentration and atocopherol content, and negatively regulated g-tocopherol concentration and g-tocopherol content (Table
1), indicating that the candidate gene is directly related
to conversion of g-tocopherol to a-tocopherol. Fine
mapping using F5 lines showed that g-TMT3 was located
in a QTL region. This study focused on the molecular
characterization of g-TMT3 gene.
Based on sequencing analysis and gene expression
analysis, the nucleotide polymorphisms in g-TMT3 promoter region might increase the expression level of gTMT3 in developing seeds of KAS, and subsequently
associated with high a-tocopherol concentration in KAS
seeds. Transient GUS assay for the 1.2-kb promoter

cis-elements affecting the g-TMT3 expression is located
outside of 1.2-kb upstream of the transcriptional start
site.
Two of the polymorphisms were located in transcription factor binding motifs in the 5’-upstream region of
the g-TMT3 gene in high a-tocopherol soybeans (Figure
7). The first mutation is located in a CAAT box, which
acts as an enhancer for gene expression. The canonical
sequence of CAAT box is “CCAAT”, which is the
sequence found in Ichihime. The KAS type is
“CAAAT”, which is not canonical but is recognized as a
functional CAAT box in mouse [22]. At present, we do
not know any report that mutation in a CAAT box can
enhance gene expression. The second mutation produced a MYB binding site in the KAS promoter; this
same sequence ("CTGTTA”) is also found in the caffeic
acid O-methyltransferase gene promoter of Arabidopsis
[24]. In Arabidopsis, the “CTGTTA” motif is recognized
by maize MYB transcription factors ZmMYB31 and
ZmMYB42 [24]. Further analysis of these cis-elements
will provide information of whether these polymorphisms contribute to alteration in the promoter activity.
Regulation of tocopherol content and concentration in
soybean

The tocopherol content analysis in this study provides
important information about regulation of the tocopherol content and concentration in soybean. In the
KAS lines, δ-tocopherol content was lower than in Ichihime lines at 40 DAF. However, the content of g-tocopherol did not differ between KAS lines and Ichihime
lines. Since the peaks from g-tocopherol and b-tocopherol could not be separated by the analytic method
used in this study, it is suggested that increase in btocopherol content might mask a decrease in the content of g-tocopherol. Thus, g-TMT3 may catalyze both
g-tocopherol and δ-tocopherol conversion to a-tocopherol and b-tocopherol, respectively (Figure 1). The δtocopherol decrease and a-tocopherol increase in KAS
lines also raises the question of whether g-TMT3 can
also catalyze the methylation of MPBQ to DMPBQ. It is
reported that Arabidopsis g-TMT (VTE4) was not active
toward MPBQ in vitro [27]. In soybean, there was little
similarity in amino acid sequences between g-TMTs and
MPBQ-MTs, indicating that soybean g-TMTs might not
be active toward MPBQ. Further analysis of the enzymatic activity and substrate specificity of g-TMT3 will
provide more information about the biochemical properties of g-TMT3.
The possibility of functional differentiation of g-TMT
proteins

g-TMT1, g-TMT2, and g-TMT3 proteins have amino
acid similarity more than 90% and two SAM binding

domains (Figure 6), suggesting that they all possess the
g-TMT activity that catalyzes the conversion of g-tocopherol to a-tocopherol. It is elucidated that three gTMT genes (g-TMT1, g-TMT2, and g-TMT3) were
expressed in leaves and developing seeds where a-tocopherol was synthesized and accumulated (Figure 10, Figure 11). However, it is indicated that alteration in
expression level of g-TMT3 alone could increase both
a-tocopherol concentration and a-tocopherol content to
up to 2.4 times that of typical soybean (Figure 8A, 9A).
If g-TMT1 or g-TMT2 mutations are also able to
enhance a-tocopherol accumulation, gene pyramiding of
these g-TMT variants will enable us to develop new soybean varieties with higher a-tocopherol concentration
or content than KAS. g-TMT1, g-TMT2, and g-TMT3
polypeptides showed differences in their NH2-terminal
region (Figure 6), although they shared high amino acid
similarity with g-TMTs found in several other plant species (Figure 6). Interestingly, no plastid signal peptide
was predicted in g-TMT1 and g-TMT3 based on in
silico analysis. a-Tocopherol is known to be localized
and be synthesized in plastids [11], and enzymes
involved in its biosynthesis are localized inside the plastid [11,28]. Further analysis about the subcellular localization of g-TMT1 and g-TMT3 might elucidate the
functional diversifications in g-TMT proteins for the
regulation of a-tocopherol biosynthesis in soybean.

Conclusions
In this work, we identified a QTL responsible for
genetic regulation of the high a-tocopherol concentration in KAS. In addition to regulating a-tocopherol
concentration, this QTL also affected g-tocopherol
concentration and δ-tocopherol concentration. Thus it
is suggested that a gene underlying this QTL regulates
tocopherol concentration. Through fine mapping, gTMT3 was identified as a candidate gene for the high
a-tocopherol concentration trait. g-TMT3 encodes gtocopherol methyltransferase, which catalyzes the
methylation g-tocopherol to a-tocopherol. The expression of g-TMT3 in the developing seeds of KAS lines
was higher than in the seeds of Ichihime lines. Concomitantly, g-TMT3 expression was higher in leaves of
KAS than in those of Ichihime. Taken these results
together, it is concluded that the promoter region
polymorphisms caused higher g-TMT3 expression in
KAS, resulting in a higher a-tocopherol concentration.
A transient activity analysis of g-TMT3 promoters
showed that the activity of KAS g-TMT3 promoter was
higher than that of Ichihime g-TMT3 promoter. In this
study, it is also demonstrated that genetic variation in
the promoter region of g-TMT3 was associated with
both a-tocopherol content and concentration in soybean seeds.

Methods
Plant material and growing conditions

A total of 140 F2 seeds derived from crosses between
Ichihime and KAS were used for QTL mapping. The
distal portion of each seed was cut off and used for
tocopherol concentration analysis. The F 2 seeds were
grown in commercial potting soil (Katakura Chikkarin
Co., Ltd., Japan) in the greenhouse of Hokkaido University, Japan (43°0’N, 141°21’E) in 2005. Ten seeds from
each plant were collected and bulked for tocopherol
concentration analysis. Leaves were harvested from each
plant, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored
at -30°C until DNA extraction.
For gene expression and tocopherol quantification
analysis in developing seeds, HIF-derived lines were
used. An HIF (F5-24) was identified as being heterozygous around the g-TMT3 locus based on the genotypes
of the SSR markers at flanking loci. The plant was
selfed to obtain lines that were homozygous for either
Ichihime or KAS marker alleles around the g-TMT3
locus. Three lines homozygous for the Ichihime alleles
(24-10, 24-14, 24-15) and three lines homozygous for
the KAS alleles (24-7, 24-18, 24-22) were used for analysis; these sets of lines are referred to as Ichihime lines
and KAS lines, respectively. All lines were grown at the
Hokkaido University experimental farm in June 2008.
Seeds of each plant were sampled at 30 days after flowering (DAF), 40 DAF and 50 DAF. The seeds were
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°
C until gene expression and tocopherol content
analyses.
Extraction and HPLC analysis of tocopherols

Tocopherols were extracted from mature seeds and analyzed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) following the procedure described by
Dwiyanti et al. [18].
For F2 seeds, a distal portion of the seed was cut off
with razor blade and cut into bits. Ten mg of sample
was weighed and sonicated in 300 μl of 80% aqueous
ethanol for 10 min at room temperature. Hexane (600
μl) was added to the sample for extraction. The sample
was let sit at 4°C before being centrifuged at 13,000 rpm
for 5 min using a refrigerated centrifuge (Eppendorf
centrifuge 5417R, Eppendorf). The upper (hexane) phase
was transferred to an HPLC vial (Waters Corp., Japan).
Analysis was performed in an HPLC system (Hitachi
LaChrom Elite, Hitachi High-Technologies Corp., Japan)
with an Inertsil ODS-3 reverse-phase column (3.0 mm ×
250 mm, GL Sciences, Japan). Column temperature was
maintained at 40°C and separation was performed under
isocratic condition for 25 min. Solvent A was acetonitrile, solvent B was methanol, and the ratio of solvent A

Page 13 of 17

to solvent B was 75:25 (v/v). Flow rate was 0.5 ml/min.
Tocopherols were detected at the wavelength of 295 nm.
For F3 seeds derived from F2 plants, five seeds from
each plant were bulked and ground into fine powder.
Seed powder (50 mg) was weighed into a 15-ml test
tube. The powder was sonicated in 1 ml of 80% aqueous
ethanol for 15 minutes at room temperature. After incubation at 4°C for 30 min, the sample was centrifuged for
10 min at 2,500 rpm in a Tomy RL-100 centrifuge
(Tomy Seiko Co., Japan). The upper phase was transferred to an HPLC vial. Analysis was performed in an
HPLC system (Hitachi LaChrom Elite, Hitachi HighTechnologies Corp., Japan) with same column as used
for the F2 seed analysis. Column temperature was maintained at 40°C and separation was performed under isocratic condition for 25 min. The mobile phase was
acetonitrile:methanol at a ratio 90:10 (v/v) ratio. Flow
rate was 0.5 ml/min. Tocopherols were detected at the
wavelength of 295 nm. Each analysis was performed
twice.
Tocopherol extraction and quantification of developing seeds were performed based on a procedure developed previously [29] with several modifications. Twenty
mg of freeze-dried seed powder was stirred in 1 ml cold
acetone. The sample was sonicated at room temperature
for 20 min. After the sonication, the sample was incubated at 4°C for 30 min. Centrifugation was performed
twice, at 13,000 rpm for 10 min each time using a refrigerated centrifuge (Eppendorf centrifuge 5417R, Eppendorf). The upper solution was transferred into an HPLC
vial. The analysis was performed using a Hitachi
LaChrom Elite with a reverse-phase column (Inertsil
ODS-3, 4.6 mm × 250 mm). The column temperature
was maintained at 40°C. The analysis was performed
under isocratic condition, with a mobile phase of ethyl
acetate:75% methanol at a ratio of 50:50 (v/v). Tocopherols were detected by UV light with the detection
wavelength set at 295 nm. Each analysis was performed
three times.
Tocopherol content in the sample was calculated
against the peak area of dl-tocol (Tama Biochemical Co.
Ltd. Japan). dl-Tocol was added into the 80% ethanol or
acetone used in the extraction at a concentration of 3
μg/ml.
Genotyping

Leaves from each F2 plants were sampled and stored at
-30°C until DNA extraction. Genomic DNA isolation
was performed according to the CTAB method as
described by Dwiyanti [18]. About 0.2 g of leaf tissue
ground in liquid nitrogen was added to 700 μl of cetyl
trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) extraction buffer.
After 30 min incubation at 60°C, the extract was mixed

Dwiyanti et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:152
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/152

with 700 μl of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1 v/v),
and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min in a refrigerated centrifuge Tomy MR150 (Tomy Seiko Co., Japan).
The aqueous solution was transferred to a 1.5-ml tube,
and mixed with 500 μl of cold isopropanol for nucleic
acid precipitation. Crude nucleic acids were collected by
centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min in a refrigerated
centrifuge Tomy MR150 (Tomy Seiko Co., Japan). The
nucleic acid pellet was washed with 150 μl of 70% ethanol and the remaining liquid was evaporated. The pellet
was then dissolved in TE buffer. RNA was precipitated
by lithium chloride as described in [18]. About 20 ng of
total DNA was used as the template for PCR analysis.
SSR markers were selected from the soybean consensus linkage map [30] to cover all soybean linkage groups
and tested for polymorphism between Ichihime and
KAS. Additional SSR markers were developed based on
the soybean genomic database Phytozome [20] and soybean SSR database BARCSOYSSR_1.0 [31]. Genotypes
of 148 selected SSR markers were determined in F 2
plants. The DNA band for each marker was amplified
by using the PCR procedure described previously [18].
Amplified products were separated on either 3% Agarose S (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd), 4%
NuSieve Agarose S (Cambrex Bio Science Rockland,
Inc.), or 10% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained
with ethidium bromide, and DNA bands were photographed under UV light.
Genetic mapping and QTL analysis

A linkage map based on the genotypes of 152 SSR markers in 122 F2 plants was constructed using MapManager QTX [32]. Map distances were calculated in
centiMorgans (cM) by using the Kosambi function.
QTL analyses for a-tocopherol concentration, g-tocopherol concentration and δ-tocopherol concentration
were carried out in both F2 seeds and F2 plants. For F2
plants, QTL analyses for a-tocopherol content and gtocopherol content were also performed. Permutation
analysis (1,000 times) was performed to determine the
genome-wide minimum significant LOD threshold
score. Based on the analysis result, QTLs with LOD
score exceeding 2.8 were regarded as effective loci.
Initial QTL mapping was performed by using the interval mapping (IM) method provided in MapQTL 5.0
[19]. Markers flanking the QTLs were used as cofactors
in QTL mapping by using the MQM method in the
same program.
Fine mapping

F 5 plants were generated from F 2 plants by using the
single-seed-descent method. These F 5 plants were
planted at the Hokkaido University experimental farm,
Japan (43°0’N, 141°21’E) in June 2007. Ten seeds from

Page 14 of 17

each plant were bulked for tocopherol concentration
analysis, and the leaves of each plant were used for
DNA genotyping. Tocopherol quantification was performed with the same method used for F3 seeds. DNA
was extracted from leaves with the CTAB method.
Six SSR markers (Table 4) were developed to identify
recombinants in the region containing the QTL. These
markers genotypes were determined in F5 plants. The
PCR reaction mixture was 20 ng DNA, 1 μl of 10× PCR
buffer (TaKaRa), 0.25 mM of dNTP mixture (TaKaRa),
0.2 μM forward primer, 0.2 μM reverse primer and 0.5
units of Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa) in a total
volume of 10 μl. PCR reaction was performed as follows:
an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 5 min; followed
by 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s, and 72°C
for 30 s; followed by a final extension step at 72°C for 7
min. PCR products were separated on 10% acrylamide
gels, and bands were visualized under UV illumination.
Phylogenetic analysis and plastid transit peptide
prediction

Amino acid sequences of g-TMT1, g-TMT2, and gTMT3 were obtained from the Phytozome database
[20]. Amino acid sequences of g-TMT homologs from
cyanobacteria (Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002
[ACA99779.1]), green algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [CA159122.1]), plants (Lotus japonicus [DQ013360.1],

ClustalW function in MEGA 4.0 software [35]. A phylogenetic tree of the proteins was constructed by using
the neighbor-joining method in MEGA 4.0 software
[35]. A bootstrap (resampling) test was performed 1,000
times to determine the distances between proteins. Plastid transit peptide prediction was performed using
ChloroP 1.1 [36].
Gene cloning and sequencing

Genomic DNA samples from high a-tocopherol soybean
varieties (KAS, Dobrogeance, and Dobrudza 14 Pancevo)
and typical soybean varieties (Ichihime, Toyokomachi,
and Williams 82) were isolated by the CTAB method
described in the genotyping section. Primer pairs were
designed based on g-TMT3 (Glyma09g35680.1) genomic
information [20]. g-TMT3 fragments were amplified by
using the following PCR conditions: initial denaturation
step at 95°C for 5 min; followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for
30 s, annealing temperature for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min;
followed by a final extension step at 72°C for 7 min.
PCR products were separated in 1% Agarose S gel
(Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd). Expected amplification products were excised from the gel, precipitated
with ethanol and ligated into the pGEM-T Easy vector
(Promega Corp.). Vectors containing DNA fragments
were transformed into Escherichia coli strain JM109.
After overnight culture, plasmids were isolated by using
Wizard SV Plus Minipreps (Promega Corp.). DNA fragments were treated with a Big Dye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing ver.3.1 kit (Applied Biosystems) with the following reaction conditions: 30 cycles of 96°C for 10 s,
50°C for 5 s and 60°C for 2 min. DNA fragments were
sequenced by using an ABI PRISM 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) and the sequences were
aligned using the BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor
[37].
RNA extraction

Total RNA was extracted from developing seeds or
leaves following the lithium chloride precipitation procedure [38] with several modifications. After frozen tissue
(about 200 mg) was ground to a fine powder in liquid
nitrogen, 150 μl of Tris-saturated phenol (pH 8.0) and
500 μl of extraction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1
mM EDTA pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1% SDS) were added
to the frozen powder. The mixture was ground thoroughly. Three-hundred μl of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol
(24:1 v/v) was added to the sample, the solution was
vortexed, and the aqueous and organic layers were separated by centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 10 min, 4°C) in a
refrigerated centrifuge (HITACHI Himac CF15RX II,
Tokyo, Japan). The aqueous phase was transferred into
a 1.5-ml tube. The chloroform:isoamyl alcohol treatment
was performed twice. The RNA was precipitated by the

addition of 0.3 volumes of 10 M lithium chloride. After
being stored at 4°C overnight, the solution was centrifuged (15,000 rpm, 15 min, 4°C). The RNA pellet was
dried by leaving the tube opened on ice. The RNA pellet
was resuspended in RNase free water.
DNA was removed from the resuspended pellet by
DNase I treatment. Ten units of DNase I (TaKaRa) and
DNase I buffer was added into the RNA solution. The
mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 min. RNA was
precipitated again in the presence of 0.3 M sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of ethanol. The RNA pellet was
dried, and again resuspended in RNase free water.
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis

Each cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA by
using the M-MLV reverse transcriptase system (Invitrogen) with random hexamer primers according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. After synthesis, one volume
of cDNA was diluted with four volumes of nuclease-free
water.
The quantitative RT-PCR reaction was conducted in a
20-μl volume containing 5 μl of cDNA, 12.5 mol of
each primer and 2× SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Applied
Biosystems). The reaction was performed in a DNA
Engine Opticon3 (MJ Research Inc.) under the following
conditions: 40 cycles of 95°C for 20 s, 58°C for 20 s and
72°C for 20 s. The specificity of the amplification was
verified by melting-curve analysis. The expression levels
of the g-TMT genes were normalized to the level of 18
rRNA for developing seeds analysis, and to b-tubulin for
leaf analysis. Primers used for each g-TMT gene, 18S
rRNA and b-tubulin are summarized in Table 5.
Bioinformatic analysis of the promoter sequences

The upstream 1.3 kb regions of g-TMT3 from Ichihime,
Toyokomachi, Williams 82, KAS, Dobrogeance, and
Dobrudza 14 Pancevo were analyzed. Regulatory elements in these regions were analyzed using program
PLACE [39] and PLANTCARE [40].

Generation of transgenic Arabidopsis harboring GUS
gene under the control of g-TMT3 promoter

The 1.2 kb region upstream the transcriptional start site
in the g-TMT3 promoter was amplified from Ichihime
and KAS, cloned into PCR®8/GW/TOPO® vector (Invitrogen). The plasmids were sequenced. The promoter
fragments were inserted into a plant expression vector
pMDC100 [41] containing a b-glucuronidase (GUS)
reporter gene [42]. The construct was introduced into
Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105. Arabidopsis
thaliana ecotype Columbia plants were transformed
with A. tumefaciens harboring the expression vector
using a floral-dip method [43].
GUS histochemical and activity analyses

For GUS histochemical assay of transgenic Arabidopsis,
leaves from T2 plants were soaked with staining solution
containing 1 mg ml-1 of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-b-dglucuronide (X-Gluc) based on protocol described by
[44]. The soaked leaves were vacuumed for 10 minutes
and incubated overnight at 37°C. The chlorophylls were
removed by a rinse with 99.5% ethanol after staining
treatment.
For GUS activity assay, crude protein was extracted
from leaves of T2 plants with 200 μl of extraction buffer containing 50 mM of sodium phosphate (pH 7.0),
10 mM of EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.1% of SDS, and 0.1% of
Triton X-100. Sixteen μl of the extract was mixed with
50 μl of 1 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl-b-D-glucuronide
(4-MUG) and 34 μl of extraction buffer, and incubated
at 37°C for 0 min, 30 min, and 60 min. The reactions
were stopped by adding 200 μl of 0.2 M sodium carbonate. The fluorescence of 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) derived from the reaction was measured using
Wallac ArvoTM 1420 Multilabel Counter (Perkin
Elmer). Protein content in the extracts was determined
using Quick Start™ Bradford Protein Assay Kit (BioRad Laboratories). GUS activity was expressed as pmol
4-MU·min-1·mg protein.
