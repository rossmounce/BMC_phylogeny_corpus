Abstract
Background: Interferon is well thought-out as the key defence against all infections including HCV. The only
treatment for HCV infection is pegylated interferon alpha (IFN-a) but unluckily more than half of the infected
individuals do not act in response to the cure and become chronic HCV carriers. The mechanism how HCV induce
interferon resistance is still elusive. It is recently reported that HCV envelope protein 2 interacts with PKR which is
the interferon-inducible protein kinase and which in turn blocks the activity of its target molecule called eukaryotic
initiation factor elF2. Sequence analysis of Envelope protein reveals it contains a domain homologous to
phosphorylation sites of PKR andthe translation initiation factor eIF2alpha. Envelope protein competes for
phosphorylation with PKR. Inhibition of kinase activity of PKR is postulated as a mechanism of to interferon (IFN)
resistance.
Results: Present study involves the insilico investigation of possible role of potential phosphorylation in envelope 2
protein of 3a genotype in interferon resistance. Envelope protein coding genes were isolated from local HCV
isolates, cloned and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis was done and tertiary structure of envelope gene was
predicted. Visualization of phosphorylation in tertiary structure reveals that residue 266 and 267 of envelope gene 2
are surface exposed and their phosphorylation may compete with the phosphorylation of PKR protein and possibly
involved in mediating Interferon Resistance.
Conclusion: A hybrid in-silico and wet laboratory approach of motif prediction, evolutionary and structural analysis
has pointed out serine 266 and 267 of the HCV E2 gene as a hopeful claimant for the serine phosphorylation.
Recognition of these nucleotide variations may assist to propose genotype precise therapy to avoid and resolve
HCV infections.

Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of hepatitis
which reduces the quality of life of some 170 million
people worldwide [1]. HCV infection is frequently
associated with chronic liver diseases and development
of hepatocellular carcinoma. In Pakistan propensity of
HCV infection in local population is ≥6% with prevalent
genotype 3a [2]. The patients infected with genotype 3a

respond efficiently to interferon therapy but unfortunately the rate of reoccurrence of infection is also very
high and after relapse the patients show resistance to
interferon therapy. Recent studies showed resistance to
interferon in HCV infection has been partially ascribed
to functional inhibition of PKR which is interferon
induced anti-viral protein [3-7]. HCV is an enveloped
sense, single stranded RNA virus belonging to family
Flaviviridae. Its genome is 9.6 kb in size and encodes 10
proteins which are synthesized as a poly-protein precursor and subsequently processed by host as well as viral
proteases to yield ten mature proteins. HCV also

encodes an eleventh protein, ARFP or F that is produced
by translational frame shifting from the core region [8].
Viral proteins are expressed in a cap-independent manner by means of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)
located in the 5’ UTR [9-11].
The IFN system is the first line of defence against viral
infection in mammals [12]. IFNs are glycoproteins commonly known as cytokines which are released by the
cells during infections.Activation of type I IFN (IFN-a &
b) genes at transcription level is mainly triggered by
viral double-stranded RNA present in infected cells
[13,14]. Upon infection the virus particles replicate
inside the host cell ultimately the cell dies and viral
particles are released that can infect surrounding cells.
However, the infected cell can warn neighbouring cells
of a viral presence by releasing interferon. The neighbouring cells, in response to interferon signalling, produce large amounts of an enzyme known as (PKR). PKR
is aserine/threonine kinase found in cells in dormant
state.PKR is induced by interferon and activated upon
autophosphorylation.It plays an important role in
cellular antiviral defence as well as in apoptosis, signal
transduction, and transformation [15]. Activation of
PKR by autophosphorylation occur upon binding to its
regulator, dsRNA molecules [16,17].This permits the
enzyme to phosphorylate its substrates. Best known of
these is translational initiation factor eIF2, which is
phosphorylated on serine 51 of its subunit. Phosphorylation of eIF2a controls a number of cellular processes,
most important of which is the blockage of protein
synthesis. Phosphorylation of many cellular and viral
proteins, including the human immunodeficiency virus
transactivator protein, Tat [18,19], and 90-kDa proteins
from rabbit reticulocytes [20] and human cells is
mediated by PKR [21-24]. The roles of the other
phosphorylation events are as yet unknown. Different
genotypes of HCV exhibit different rates of response to
IFN-alpha and these variants are characterized by mutations that may be accountable for IFN-alpha resistance.
Two HCV proteins that have been involved in IFN
resistance through inhibition of its downstream protein
kinase (PKR) are NS5A and E2 [17,25]. The E2 glycoprotein are supposed to be the first viral components
that come in contact with the host cell surface receptors, and elicits production of neutralizing antibodies
against the virus, and is involved in viral morphogenesis.
It binds to external loop of CD81, a tetraspanin found
on the surface of many cell types including hepatocytes
[26]. This viral envelope glycoprotein is an obvious
candidate for vaccine development as it is chosen target
for humoral and cell-mediated immune responses
[27,28]. Taylor et al., 1999 reported that envelope protein
2 of HCV contains a 12 amino-acid sequence domain
which is homologous to the autophosphorylation site of

PKR and initiation factor eIF2a, which is growth they
considered it a possible mechanism by which HCV circumvents the antiviral effect of IFN and cause chronic
infections and hepatocellular carcinoma. They also
reported that E2 proteins with a PePHD sequence identical to genotypes 2 and 3 of HCV, which are known IFN
sensitive genotypes, showed only a weak inhibitory effect
against PKR activity [28].

Methods
PCR amplification of E1E2 genes & cloning

Hepatitis C virus RNA of local 3a genotype was isolated
from the serum of a chronic HCV carrier using RNA
isolation kit (Gentra, Life Technologies, USA) according
to the given kit protocol. The cDNA was synthesized
using gene specific anti sense primer and amplified after
addition of sense primer. The required amplified product was of approximately 1700 bps. The required band
was excised from the gel and the DNA was extracted
with DNA isolation kit (Fermentas Inc. Germany). The
amplified sequence encoding E1E2 genes were cloned in
pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen Tech USA) between Hindi
III and EcoR I sites. Transformation: The plasmid was
used to transform competent cells. Competent cells that
have taken up plasmid wereselected by using 100 g/ml
ampicillin and 12.4 ug/ml of tetracycline.
Colony PCR

To identify bacteria harbouring cloned E1 and E2 genes,
individual colonies are used to directly inoculate PCR
reactions. The PCR reactions were prepared with 5
pmol each of vector-specific primers T7 (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG) and BGH Following a single
round of amplification; products are isolated on a 1.5%,
ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel, a successful cloning reaction being visualized as a product at approximately 2 kb. Colonies identified as possessing a desired
clone are then used to inoculate a 3 ml LB culture containing 100 g/ml ampicillin, shaking at 225 rpm overnight at 37°C the plasmids was isolated through plasmid
isolation kit by (fermentas). Cultures are used to prepare
a plasmid stock Quantification of the plasmid prep is
performed on nano drop. Isolated DNA was sequenced.
At least three clones were sequenced using in both
directions according to the sequencing protocol.
Sequence analysis

The DNA strands from both PCR products and plasmids were sequenced by using specific sense and anti
sense primers the sequences reported in this paper have
been deposited in genebank database (Accession no:
EU399722). Approximately 350 ng of plasmid DNA
used for each sequencing reaction, containing 5 pmol of
primer, 2 ul of big dye, 2 ul of sequencing buffer

(applied biosystems) in a total volume of 10 ul. Sequencing profile was 94°C for 20 s, 58°C for 20 s 60°C for 4
min, repeated 30 times, transferred to a 0.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, labelled DNA is then precipitated with
50 ul of absolute ethanol. The DNA was kept at room
temperature for at least 30 min and centrifuged at
14000 g for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded the
DNA pellet washed twice with 250 ul of 70% ethanol,
centrifuged at 14000 g for 20 min each time. The pellet
was dried and DNA was analyzed using an ABI prism
sequencer.
Phosphorylation sites Prediction

To check post translational modifications in the local 3a
sequences of the envelope genes in silico N-linked phosphorylation sites were predicted using the freely available online servers i.e. NetPhos 2.0 developed with
neural network which predicts phosphorylation sites in
sequences and structure [29] and Scanite which predicts
target motifs for different kinases [30]. Scanite predictions were made on the “Low Stringency” to identify as
many sites as possible. Further analysis was done using
these predicted sites (Figure 1).
Protein Structure Prediction and Analysis

Due to the unavailability of template model in Protein
Data Bank (PDB) server [31] ab-initio model was developed using I-TASSER [32]. Sequences were uploaded
and models were obtained. The phosphorylation sites
predicted with two servers were shown in the 3D structure. Chimera [33] and SWISS PDB viewer [34] was
used to conclude whether potential phosphorylation
sites were surface opened or masked. Five residues were
observed on the exposed surface of the model (aa: S66,
S266, S267, S356, T311). The most reliable sites are
visualized in the (Figure 2).

envelope gene sequence.

Phylogenetic Analysis: Protein sequences of local envelope gene sequence and other reported sequences for 3a
genotypes from different countries of the world (Japan,
China, USA, UK) were retrieved from NCBI. All sequences
(EU399722, NC009824, D17763, AY958007, AY958005,
AY958014, AY958012, AY958010, AY957994, DQ430819
and DQ437509) were then aligned by using CLUSTALW
[35]. A neighbour joining tree was constructed using
PHYLIP [36] (Figure 3).

Results
To characterize the role of envelope genes in disease
progression we cloned the amplified PCR product in
mammalian expression vector pc DNA 3.1. This vector
has a CMV promoter which represents an effective
mean to transduce eukaryotic cells for transient and
stable expression studies. The cloned genes were

sequenced in both direction and the consensus sequence
was made and submitted to NCBI GeneBank database.
The assigned Accession number to this sequence is
EU399722. Local envelope 2 gene sequence was compared with other reported sequences for 3a genotypes
from different regions of the world to find out the percentage nucleotide identity (PNI) (Table 1). Multiple
sequence alignment phylogenetic study was done by
using CLUSTALW[35] (Figure 3).
Potential phosphorylation sites in the cytoplasmic
domain of the E2 protein was predicted, which may be
possibly involved in mediating interferon resistance.
Phosphorylation site predictor has the tendency to overpredict, therefore stringency was increased and only
those motifs were selected that received a NetPhos
score of 0.8 or higher or predicted by both NetPhos [29]
(Figure 1) and Scansite [30]. The final yield was 31
putative sites (Ser- 11, Thr- 14 and Tyr- 6). Fine of
them were predicted by both the servers.
The phosphorylaton sites must be present on the
surface of the protein. To find this the local sequence
was analysed for finding the surface accessibility by
using online server NetSurfP [37] (Table 2). The
putative sites were then visualized in the 3D protein
structure using SWISS PDB Viewer[34] (Figure 2).

The PDB structure was developed by using Ab-initio
protein structure predictor server I- TASSER[32]. From
all this analysis two sites were found to be most reliable
phosphorylation sites i.e. S266 and S267. Scansite was
used for finding the phosphorylation interaction motifs
and found that S66, S266 and S267 interact with the
PKC, Casein Kinase, SRC Kinase and AKT Kinase which
were then investigated in GeneCards and was confirmed
from UniGene and UniProt[38] (Table 3).

Discussion
The envelope protein 2 (E2) of hepatitis C virus (HCV)
is recently reported to interact with double stranded
RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) [9,12,15,16,23,25].
HCV envelope protein E2 contains a domain homologous to phosphorylation sites of the interferon-inducible
protein kinase PKR and the translation initiation factor
eIF2 alpha, which is a target of PKR [23]. As a result E2
competes and inhibited the kinase activity of PKR and
blocked its inhibitory effect on protein synthesis and cell
growth [18,21,29,32,39]. We aim to find out the role of
phosphorylation of envelope protein 2 on interferon &
PKR response. Envelope protein coding genes were

fragment was sequenced and the sequence was submitted to NCBI (EU 399722). The local envelope gene
sequence was compared with other reported sequences
for 3a genotypes from different regions of the world to
find out the percentage nucleotide identity (PNI) as variations in the envelope genes accounts for different
degrees of disease progression in HCV RNA positive
individuals with different genotypes [3,12,25]. In silico
N-linked phosphorylation sites were predicted (Figure 1)
