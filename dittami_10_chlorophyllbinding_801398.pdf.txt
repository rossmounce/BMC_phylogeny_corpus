Chlorophyll-binding proteins revisited - a
multigenic family of light-harvesting and stress
proteins from a brown algal perspective

Abstract
Background: Chlorophyll-binding proteins (CBPs) constitute a large family of proteins with diverse functions in
both light-harvesting and photoprotection. The evolution of CBPs has been debated, especially with respect to the
origin of the LI818 subfamily, members of which function in non-photochemical quenching and have been found
in chlorophyll a/c-containing algae and several organisms of the green lineage, but not in red algae so far. The
recent publication of the Ectocarpus siliculosus genome represents an opportunity to expand on previous work
carried out on the origin and function of CBPs.
Results: The Ectocarpus genome codes for 53 CBPs falling into all major families except the exclusively green
family of chlorophyll a/b binding proteins. Most stress-induced CBPs belong to the LI818 family. However, we
highlight a few stress-induced CBPs from Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Chondrus crispus that belong to different
sub-families and are promising targets for future functional studies. Three-dimensional modeling of two LI818
proteins revealed features common to all LI818 proteins that are likely to interfere with their capacity to bind
chlorophyll b and lutein, but may enable binding of chlorophyll c and fucoxanthin. In the light of this finding, we
examined the possibility that LI818 proteins may have originated in a chlorophyll c/fucoxanthin containing
organism and compared this scenario to three alternatives: an independent evolution of LI818 proteins in different
lineages, an ancient origin together with the first CBPs, before the separation of the red and the green lineage, or
an origin in the green lineage and a transfer to an ancestor of haptophytes and heterokonts during a cryptic
endosymbiosis event.
Conclusions: Our findings reinforce the idea that the LI818 family of CBPs has a role in stress response. In addition,
statistical analyses of phylogenetic trees show an independent origin in different eukaryotic lineages or a green
algal origin of LI818 proteins to be highly unlikely. Instead, our data favor an origin in an ancestral chlorophyll a/ccontaining organism and a subsequent lateral transfer to some green algae, although an origin of LI818 proteins in
a common ancestor of red and green algae cannot be ruled out.

Background
Photosynthesis is a central process in plant physiology,
which involves the collection of solar energy via two
types of light-harvesting complexes (LHC-I and LHCII). LHC-II is the most abundant of these complexes in
thylakoid membranes, and consists of pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) which are bound to chlorophyllbinding proteins (CBPs). LHC proteins constitute a

large family of proteins [1,2], which includes chlorophyll
a/b-binding proteins (CABs), fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/
c-binding proteins (FCPs) [3,4], high light-induced proteins (HLIPs), early light-induced proteins (ELIPs), the
psbS subunit of photosystem II (psbS), and stressenhanced proteins (SEPs). CABs, as well as FCPs
(together referred to as CBPs in this manuscript), have
been suggested to have emerged from cyanobacterial
HLIPs as a result of two duplication events and the subsequent loss of one transmembrane helix [1], but this
evolutionary scenario has been recently challenged by
Engelken et al. [5]. CABs and FCPs were frequently

reported to be transcriptionally repressed in response to
light stress [6-8].
Although CBPs are classically considered as lightharvesting proteins, increasing amounts of data point to
possible additional functions within this protein family.
For example, a number of genes encoding FCPs were
observed to be down-regulated in a developmental
mutant of the brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus [9].
Moreover, several recent transcriptomic studies of stress
response [10-14] highlighted FCPs that were upregulated in response to heat-, salt-, oxidative-, or light
stress in both brown algae and diatoms. Within the
green lineage, similar observations were made concerning CBPs in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii after high light
treatment [15,16]. The up-regulated CBPs were referred
to as stress-induced CBPs, LI818 proteins, or LHCSR
[15,17,18]. They were shown to constitute one of several
distinct families of LHC proteins [14,19-21], and can be
found in a range of eukaryotic lineages.
A role of these proteins in light-harvesting seems
improbable considering their expression profiles. Functional analyses of both stress-induced CBPs and closely
related non stress-induced CBPs carried out in a few
model eukaryotes suggest that at least some of these
proteins function in non-photochemical quenching
(NPQ), i.e. the dissipation of excess light energy. In
C. reinhardtii, the LI818 polypeptide, unlike other
CBPs, was shown to be only loosely embedded in the
thylakoid membranes and to be localized in stromaexposed regions [22], and mutants of this protein were
affected in their capacity to adapt to high light [18].
Paralogs of LI818 proteins in the moss Physcomitrella
patens (named LHCSRs), even though not stressinduced on a transcriptomic level, were also shown to
be active in promoting NPQ and to contribute to
photoprotection under high light conditions [23].
Moreover, in the diatom Cyclotella meneghiniana, proteins of this family have been suggested to bind diadinoxanthin and diatoxanthin [24], and are important to
quench fluorescence [25]. In another diatom, P. tricornutum, a LI818 protein has been shown to be required
for efficient light response and to influence natural
variability in photoresponse [26]. Similar suggestions
have also been made for LI818 proteins from the haptophyte Emiliana huxlei [21].
In addition to uncertainties about the function of
these LI818 and LI818-like proteins, their evolutionary
origin has not yet been finally resolved. Neilson and
Durnford [20] argued that, since LI818 and LI818-like
proteins have been identified in diverse groups of photosynthetic organisms, they are likely to have been
amongst the first eukaryotic light-harvesting proteins.
On the other hand, several reports have suggested that
these proteins have evolved within the green lineage and

were transferred to the heterokonts and other chlorophyll a/c-containing algae during a cryptic primary
endosymbiosis event, which involved the uptake of a
green algal endosymbiont by an ancestral chromalveolate [18,27,28]. However, this latter theory, as well as the
chromalveolate hypothesis in general, is highly debated
[29-32], particularly because the only genomic data on
red algae come from an atypical alga with a reduced
genome and without cell wall [33].
The recent publication of the genome of the brown
alga Ectocarpus siliculosus [34] represents an interesting
opportunity to expand on previous work carried out on
the origin and function of CBPs. The Ectocarpus genome codes for a total of 53 CBPs belonging to different
families [34], several of which have already been shown
to be induced in response to stress [12]. Taking into
consideration the new sequence data from E. siliculosus,
we aimed to explore both the diversity and evolution of
this large family of proteins, focusing our attention on
stress-induced CBPs. First, we examined the phylogenetic position of known stress-induced CBPs from different organisms. We then sought to assess structural
and evolutionary differences between CABs and the
LI818 family, the latter comprising most of the stressinduced CBPs. To this means, homology modeling and
structural superimposition of E. siliculosus and C. reinhardtii proteins belonging to the LI818 clade with a previously crystallized spinach CAB were performed.
Finally, several hypotheses on the origin of the LI818
family were tested.

Results and discussion
Genomes of photosynthetic haptophytes and heterokonts
code for high numbers of CBPs and LI818 family proteins

An extensive search for CBPs in fully sequenced genomes revealed that, on average, heterokonts and haptophytes contain the highest total numbers of CBPs
(Table 1, Additional file 1), although, within the green
lineage, Volvox cateri and Physcomitrella patens also
possess numerous copies of these proteins. LI818 family
proteins are only scarcely represented within the green
lineage. They were found in one to three copies in several green algae, in the genome of the moss P. patens,
and in EST libraries produced for gymnosperms, notably
Picea glauca (two copies, gb|DR591434.1 and gb|
CO250289.1) and Picea sitchensis (three copies, Figure
1). Incomplete copies were also found in the angiosperms Medicago truncatula (one copy, gb|BG452558.1)
and Quercus robur (one copy, gb|FR633552.1). In the
genome of the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae and
EST libraries for Chondrus crispus (4,114 ESTs), Porphyra yezoensis (20,069 ESTs), and Gracilaria changii
(8,147 ESTs), no gene encoding any LI818 protein was
identified; neither was any homolog found among the

available sequences for the cryptophytes Guillardia
theta (15,173 ESTs) and Rhodomonas sp. [35]. In contrast, numerous proteins of this family were present in
haptophytes and heterokonts, where 4 to 15 copies were
found in the examined genomes. These data indicate the
importance of CBPs, and in particular of LI818 proteins,
in the marine environment and among haptophytes and
heterokonts.
CABs and FCPs contain several subfamilies

In order to establish relationships between the E. siliculosus sequences and other LHC proteins identified in
chlorophyll a/b-, chlorophyll a-, and chlorophyll a/ccontaining organisms, phylogenetic analyses with CBPs
from a wide range of taxa were performed. The topology
of the tree presented in Figure 1 is similar to results
previously published [14,19-21]. Two groups are clearly
distinguishable. A first one comprised sequences only
from the green lineage and contained most of the CABs
from terrestrial plants (LHCa + LHCb). It will not be
further discussed here, because it was already considered
in detail in previous articles [19,36]. The remaining part
of the tree constitutes the second group, which can be
split into several major divisions, each comprising
sequences from photosynthetic heterokonts and haptophytes, and containing a certain number of subfamilies
and taxon-specific subgroups.
The first division to consider was originally highlighted
by Koziol et al. [19] and was composed of members from
the cryptomonads, haptophytes, and chlorarachniophytes.
It was named LHCZ in absence of any indication on

function or localization of this class of proteins. In our
phylogeny, LHCZ also contained one brown algal as well
as several diatom sequences.
The second division corresponds to the LI818 family
(also named LHCX in diatoms, [10,11,13]), and contains
most of the stress-induced CBPs. It features three subgroups with moderate statistical support, which correspond to different taxonomic groups. One is formed
almost exclusively by stress-induced genes from several
species of diatoms, and contains the recently functionally characterized PtLHCX1 [26] (Ptr_25 in our phylogeny). Another one comprises several E. siliculosus
sequences, many of which were induced in response to
abiotic stress conditions and most of them are likely to
have been subject to concerted evolution and/or
to result from recent duplications. Effectively, proteins
Esi_12 to Esi_22 are all highly similar and located in
close proximity on supercontig 0085 in linkage group 16
of the Ectocarpus genome [37]. This group also contains
one Fucus sequence. The third subgroup is the most
heterogeneous and comprises sequences belonging
mainly to haptophytes and to organisms of the green
lineage. This subgroup also contains the LI818 proteins
that have been recently functionally characterized in
Chlamydomonas and in Physcomitrella, and which function in NPQ.
The remaining sequences were previously divided into
two groups [19,20]: one named cryptomonad/red algal
LHC clade [14,19], LhcaR [20], and LHCR in diatoms
[13,38], and a second one named FCP or LHCF clade
[19,20]. However, in this study as well as in the study of

Neilson and Durnford [20], statistical support for the
separation of these two subgroups is insufficient (10 and
5 for PhyML/bootstrap, 70 and 43 for PhyML/SH test,
and no support by MrBayes). Moreover, the position of
these two sub-groups with respect to the LI818 and
LHCZ divisions is poorly resolved in both studies [20].
We mention these divisions in our study because they
correspond to current naming conventions, but the biological relevance of such a distinction is questionable. In
contrast, among the LHCF sequences, we identified a
well-supported subgroup of proteins containing
sequences from several species of diatoms, three of
which have been shown to be induced in response to
light stress [13], as well as a group of closely related
Ectocarpus sequences.
Stress-induced chlorophyll-binding proteins

One of the questions we attempted to answer in this
study was whether all stress-induced CBPs, both in Ectocarpus and in other photosynthetic organisms, fall into
the same clade. Figure 1 clearly demonstrates that most
of the stress-induced CBPs from most examined organisms (all for Ectocarpus) belong to the LI818 clade. This
is in agreement with the supposed function of these
proteins in NPQ [18,23,25]. Nevertheless, not all LI818
proteins have been shown to be transcriptionally
induced in response to stress. This can be seen for
example in the case of the moss P. patens, where neither
of the two known LI818 proteins (represented by
Ppa_46 in Figure 1) were up-regulated in response to
osmotic-, salt-, drought, and UV-B stress in two independent studies [39,40]. Another recent study in P. tricornutum [26] has shown the protein LHCX1 to be
induced at a protein level in response to high light,
although no changes were observed on the mRNA level.
In addition to non stress-induced LI818 proteins, we
also found two cases of stress-induced CBPs from other
clades. The first of these cases are high light-induced
CBPs from P. tricornutum. While four of them clearly
fell into the LI818 clade, forming a subgroup with other
diatom sequences, three others fell into the LHCF group
and are part of a strongly supported group of diatom
proteins with a sister group of E. siliculosus proteins.
The second case is the red algal protein Ccr_01, which
fell into the LhcaR clade and which was strongly
induced in response to different abiotic stresses: 87-fold
induced in high temperature, 21-fold in high light, and
3.6-fold in low salinity (p < 0.05 for all treatments) [41].
This finding is particularly interesting considering that
in public red algal EST databases or in the (strongly
reduced) genome of Cyanidioschyzon, we were not able
to find either LI818 or psbS proteins. Should the
absence of these proteins be confirmed by the ongoing
Chondrus and Porphyra genome projects, Ccr_01 could

Page 5 of 14

be an excellent candidate for an NPQ-regulating protein
in red algae. In any case, the discovery of stress-induced
CBPs in different families supports the hypothesis that
functions other than light-harvesting may have evolved
independently in different CBP clades and in different
organisms.
Modeling of LI818 family proteins from Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii and Ectocarpus siliculosus

After having observed that most of the stress-induced
CBPs belong to the LI818 family, we attempted to assess
the structural and evolutionary changes that have
occurred in LI818 proteins compared to CABs by
homology modeling of two sequences of this subfamily,
one representative for the “brown” lineage (Esi_02 from
E. siliculosus) and another for the “green” lineage
(Cre_23 from C. reinhardtii). The N- and C-terminal
ends of Cre_23 and Esi_02 were not included in the
models because they are too divergent, and only the
residues corresponding to residues Pro 19 to Asp 215 of
the spinach CAB were considered. The modeled CBPs
from C. reinhardtii and E. siliculosus display 58% and
60% sequence similarity, respectively, with the spinach
CAB, for which the three-dimensional structure has
been solved [42]. This similarity level was sufficient to
generate a reliable 3D model for Cre_23 and Esi_02.
The a-helices a1, a3 and a4 and most of the b-turns
are well conserved for these proteins (Figure 2), which
was confirmed by the multiple sequence alignment of
the LI818-like proteins (Figure 3). In these regions,
LI818-like proteins feature key residues strictly conserved with the spinach CAB: Asp47 (Asp28, Esi_02
numbering), Glu65 (Glu48), His68 (His51), Glu180
(Glu158), Arg185 (Arg163) and Gln197 (Gln175). The
lysine 179 is also well conserved or replaced by polar
glutamine. Almost all of these residues are involved in
direct binding of chlorophyll a molecules (Chla 602,
603, 610, 612, and 613). The arginine 185 stabilizes
Glu65 through an ionic interaction, which coordinates
the magnesium ion of Chla 602 [42].
The main difference in the secondary structure is
observed in the loop connecting the helices a1 and a2
and in the helix a2 itself. This region is shorter in the
LI818 proteins (between 6 and 12 residues shorter) and
the sequence composition is completely different (Figure
3), resulting in a significant displacement of the helix a2
in the models of Cre_23 and Esi_02 (Figure 4). All
LI818 proteins feature a conserved signature G-P-A-XX-[H/Q] in this region. The N-terminal end of this loop
is more divergent and the sequences can be grouped
according to three types of sequence patterns (Figure 3).
These three groups roughly correspond to several subfamilies that could be distinguished within the LI818
clades (Figure 1). The group including all LI818 proteins

from E. siliculosus also comprises some CBPs from
green algae (Cre_23, Cre_24, and Sco_01) and from
moss (Ppa_46). In the spinach CAB, the helix a2 is
involved in the binding of two chlorophyll b molecules
(Chlb 607 and Chlb 606) and one lutein molecule (Lut
621) [42]. As shown in our 3D models and in the alignment, the location of helix a2 in LI818-like proteins is
completely different and cannot provide similar binding
interactions for these chlorophyll b and lutein molecules. Moreover, LI818 proteins possess a conserved glutamate residue (Glu176, Esi_02 numbering) instead of
an alanine at this position in the spinach CAB (Ala198).
Such a substitution would result in a steric clash with
the Chlb 607, suggesting that this molecule is likely
absent in LI818 proteins. These structural predictions
are consistent with the fact that CBPs from heterokonts

and haptophytes do not bind chlorophyll b but bind
chlorophyll c. Similarly, brown algal LHCs contain
fucoxanthin, instead of lutein. In the spinach CAB, one
end of the lutein is bound to Asp47, while the opposite
end interacts with Trp97, which is localized in helix a2.
In the LI818-like proteins, Asp47 is strictly conserved,
but Trp97 is missing, since the equivalent region is
completely altered (Figure 3). In addition, fucoxanthin is
a shorter carotenoid than lutein, suggesting that one
end of a fucoxanthin molecule could interact with
Asp47 (Asp28, Esi_02 numbering), but that the recognition of the other end differs from the spinach protein
structure. In the Cre_23 model, the helix a2 adopts a
conformation similar to the Esi_02 helix a2 (Figure 4),
as predicted by the conservation of the signature
G-P-A-X-X-[H/Q] (Figure 3). This signature is also

Figure 3 Structure-based sequence alignment of the crystallized spinach CAB (code 1RWT) with proteins belonging to the LI818 clade.
The secondary structure of the spinach CAB is shown above the alignment. Conserved amino acids highlighted by a red background are
identical and those in red letters are similar. Alpha helices are represented as helices, and b-turns are marked with TT. Blue triangles indicate the
conserved residues involved in the binding of chlorophyll a molecules. The green star shows the conserved glutamate in LI818-like proteins,
predicted to preclude the binding of Chlb 607 observed in the spinach CAB. The colored frames indicate the three subgroups of helix a2 within
the LI818 subfamilies.

conserved in other green algal proteins (Cre_24 and
Sco_01) and in the protein Ppa_46 from P. patens.
Therefore, the “green” LI818 proteins cannot recognize
chlorophyll b and lutein in the same way that the spinach CAB binds these molecules [42].
Altogether, these analyses support the conservation
of the chlorophyll a binding sites in LI818 proteins.
However, these proteins can probably not recognize
chlorophyll b and lutein molecules as observed in the
spinach CAB structure [42], due to the large displacement of helix a2 (Figure 4). These structural features
raise questions about the nature of the pigments
bound in the conserved helix a2 region of the LI818

proteins. In heterokont CBPs, these changes in topology could be related to the potential binding of chlorophyll c and fucoxanthin molecules, easily explaining
the differences with the spinach CAB; in contrast, this
hypothesis is not relevant for “green” LI818 CBPs,
which are expected to bind chlorophyll b and lutein
molecules. In addition, this alteration of helix a2 is
similar in “brown” and “green” LI818 proteins, supporting that these proteins have diverged from a close,
common ancestor. This suggests that green LI818 proteins may have evolved in an ancestral chlorophyll c/
fucoxanthin-containing organism and were possibly
acquired by green algae later.

The origin of LI818 proteins in different lineages

This latter observation prompted us to reexamine the
origin of LI818 proteins in greater detail. The absence
of CBP proteins in cyanobacteria and in an extensive
EST library of the glaucophyte Cyanophora paradoxa
[43] indicates that ancestral CBPs evolved after the
separation of glaucophytes from red algae and green
plants (Figure 5A). The presence of red-, haptophyte-,
and heterokont CBPs within the same group is in agreement with the hypothesis that these proteins originate
from a photosynthetic organism from the red lineage,
and were transferred during secondary endosymbiosis.
This event, however, cannot explain the presence of
green LI818 proteins in a branch of the tree (Figure 1)
otherwise comprising purely red- and chlorophyll a/ccontaining algae. Interestingly, very similar observations
were previously made for another group of proteins:
Frommelt et al. [27] found that 5 of 16 protein
sequences from heterokonts, haptophytes, and cryptophytes involved in carotenoid synthesis were closest to
prasinophytes and not to red algal sequences. Although
genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis and

chlorophyll-binding proteins are not related, they are
both involved in photosynthesis. Notably, the enzymes
violaxanthin de-epoxidase and zeaxanthin epoxidase,
both of which were closest to the green linage in the
study of Frommelt et al. [27], are part of the xanthophyll
cycle, and thus an important actor in the regulation of
NPQ, just as it has been suggested for LI818 proteins
[18,23,25].
To go deeper in the analysis, we tested four different
hypotheses regarding the phylogenetic position of the
LI818 proteins by manually rearranging trees and performing statistical analyses. The first hypothesis assumes
independent but convergent evolution of LI818 proteins
in the “green” and the “brown” lineages. Our results
show this scenario to be highly unlikely (Hypothesis 1,
p-values < 0.00001; Figure 5B). While our model cannot
account for environmental factors that might favor such
a scenario, the aforementioned structural data provide
additional strong arguments against this hypothesis. The
second possibility was that LI818 proteins may be ancestral CBPs that have evolved in a common ancestor of
the red and green lineage [20] and have subsequently

1, 2, 3, and 4 as well as blue arrows indicate possible origins of LI818 proteins (see B and text). Orange arrows designate possible horizontal

in which, based on currently available sequence data, we would assume LI818 proteins to have been lost according to these hypotheses.
Hypothesis 1 assumes that LI818 originated independently in green plants and chlorophyll a/c-containing organisms; Hypothesis 2 assumes that
LI818 proteins evolved before the separation of the red- and green lineage; Hypothesis 3 assumes a transfer of genes from the green lineage to
a common ancestor of heterokonts and haptophytes (Chl a/c) during the cryptic endosymbiosis event proposed by Moustafa et al. [28];
Hypothesis 4 assumes a horizontal gene transfer from an ancestral chlorophyll a/c-containing organism to an early member of the green
lineage.

been lost in many embryophytes and probably also in
red algae (Figure 5B, Hypothesis 2). In this case the
position of the green LI818 proteins in our phylogenetic
tree should be in reality at the root of the green branch.
The fact that LI818 proteins were not found in red
algae or cryptophytes could be explained either by insufficient sequence data for these organisms or by a secondary loss of these proteins. Based on the statistical
analysis of a tree manually rearranged to fit this hypothesis, this option cannot be clearly ruled out (p = 0.017
and 0.05 with the AU and WSH tests, respectively).
A third hypothesis was previously proposed by Peers
et al. [18] and consists in a horizontal transfer of green
LI818 genes to a common ancestor of heterokonts and
haptophytes during a cryptic primary endosymbiosis
event. Such an event is believed to have taken place
before secondary endosymbiosis [28], and could explain
the absence of LI818 proteins in red algae but not in
cryptophytes. Under the assumption that LI818 proteins
were transferred during this event, we would expect
LI818 proteins to branch early from the green lineage.
A tree manually rearranged to fit this hypothesis
received p-values < 0.001 in both AU and WSH tests
(Figure 5B, Hypothesis 3). Hence, based on our analysis,
this option seems highly unlikely. In addition, several
studies have recently provided independent evidence
against the “Chromalveolate hypothesis” [44], favoring
distinct rhodobiont endosymbioses in chlorophyll
a/c-containing algae [30,45,46]. Under this evolutionary
scenario, it seems unlikely that a cryptic green algal
endosymbiosis could have preceded the plastidic secondary endosymbiosis in each lineage of chlorophyll
a/c-containing algae.
The last hypothesis, which was prompted by our
examination of the structure of LI818 proteins, was that
the first members of this family could have evolved in a
chlorophyll a/c-containing organism after secondary
endosymbiosis, and that a horizontal gene transfer could
have taken place to an early green organism (Figure 5B,
Hypothesis 4). Based on the close proximity of green
and haptophyte LI818 proteins in Figure 1, such a transfer could have involved an ancestral haptophyte. Molecular clock studies date the split of the red- and green
lineage to the late mesoproterozoic, over 900 million
years ago (Mya) [47,48], and secondary plastid endosymbiosis is assumed to have occurred shortly thereafter
[47]. The same studies date diversification of the green
lineage to approximately 730 to 700 Mya, respectively,
leaving a time-frame of about 200 million years during
the early neoproterozoic for such an event to have taken
place. This hypothesis does not assume any losses of
LI818 proteins except in parts of the green lineage, and
best fits our phylogenetic tree because all LI818 proteins
constitute a subfamily within the group of chlorophyll

Page 10 of 14

a/c-containing and red algal proteins (p-values of 0.983
to 0.999 with AU and WSH tests respectively). In accordance with this, the phylogenetic trees obtained for
enzymes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis [27] could
also be interpreted in the same sense, since, just as for
CBPs, several proteins from green algae (e.g. phytoene
desaturase, isopentenyl diphosphate:dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase, zeaxanthin epoxidase, violaxanthin deepoxidase) branched within a group of haptophyte and/
or heterokont sequences, and not as a sister group.
Gene acquisition by green algae is not unprecedented.
The genomic analysis of Micromonas unraveled the
transfer of bacterial genes involved in biosynthesis of
peptidoglycan [49], and this alga has also acquired several brown algal genes responsible for mannitol synthesis [31].
Although the evidence presented in this study is not
strong enough to definitely reject Hypothesis 2 (Figure
5B), our findings provide a strong indication against
the putative transfer of LI818 proteins during a cryptic
green algal endosymbiosis event preceding red algal
secondary endosymbiosis (Hypothesis 3), and favor a
scenario with a transfer in the other direction
(Hypothesis 4).

Conclusion
This study shows that E. siliculosus contains a wide
variety of CBPs from different divisions and with
potentially different functions. In all of the examined
species, most of the CBPs known to be stress-induced
belong to the LI818 family, which is particularly well
represented among haptophytes and heterokonts, but
also present in several organisms of the green lineage.
According to our analyses, the possibility that LI818
proteins may be ancestral CBPs, which have evolved
before the separation of the red and the green lineage,
remains viable. However, structural alignments and
three-dimensional modeling illustrated several elements common to LI818 proteins, which are likely to
interfere with their capacity to bind certain chlorophyll
b molecules, but may enable the binding of chlorophyll
c and/or fucoxanthin. This finding, together with the
statistical analysis of our phylogenetic tree, point to a
new possibility not dealt with in previous studies, i.e.
that LI818 proteins may have originated in an ancient
chlorophyll a/c-containing organism and could have
been later transferred to the green linage. Understanding the evolutionary history of CBPs may also increase
our understanding of the evolution of the different
eukaryotic lineages as a whole. If our hypothesis is correct, LI818 proteins will not be found in red algae. We
thus anticipate that ongoing genome projects such as
those of the red algae Chondrus and Porphyra will
confirm this prediction.

Methods
Sequence retrieval

Four approaches were taken to select sequences for this
study. First, CBPs were searched for in the sequenced
genomes of photosynthetic eukaryotes representing the
major photosynthetic lineages (Table 1). These searches
were carried out using “blastp” and reference sequences
representing the four major clades in our phylogeny. All
hits (e-value < 10) were submitted to InterProScan [50]
using default parameters, and considered CBPs if a
“Chlorophyll A-B binding protein” domain corresponding to the PFAM00504/IPR022796 motif was detected.
All sequence identifiers, database references, and InterProScan domains are given in Additional file 1. Many of
these sequences were included in our phylogenetic analysis; however, in cases where the results obtained for
related species were highly similar, only a representative
was selected.
In a second step we attempted to fill gaps in our phylogenetic tree, where no or only limited genome
sequences were available, by using data from EST
libraries. For these searches “tblastn” was used instead
of “blastp”, and in case of duplicate sequences, the longest EST was chosen. The identified CBP sequences were
translated using NCBI OrfFinder (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/projects/gorf/). In the case of red algae, only the
reduced genome of C. merolae was available for public
use, and we added EST sequences from C. crispus
(4,114 ESTs, 3 coding for CBPs; [51]), P. yezoensis
(20,069 ESTs, 4 coding for CBPs; [52]), and G. changii
(8,147 ESTs, 7 coding for CBPs; Teo et al., unpublished),
all of which were obtained from the NCBI EST database
(dbEST). Furthermore, as no genome sequences are
available for cryptophytes, the same strategy was applied
for an EST library of Guillardia theta (15,173 ESTs, 21
coding for CBPs; [53]), and we also took advantage of
the availability of five CBP sequences obtained in a previous study by Broughton et al. on Rhodomonas sp.
CS24 [35].
As we were particularly interested in stress-induced
CBPs and the possible role of these CBPs in NPQ, we
considered additional sequences relevant for these topics
in a third step: seventeen ESTs coding for CBPs from
the Antarctic diatom Chaetoceros neogracile (total number of ESTs in the library 1,744; [10]), and six previously
identified CBPs from Fucus serratus and F. vesiculosus
were selected because transcriptomic data were available
for these sequences [10,11,14]; also, three sequences
from the diatom Cyclotella meneghiniana were included,
because these proteins had been shown to be related to
NPQ [25].

Finally, several individual sequences were added to our
phylogenetic tree in order to facilitate comparisons with
previous phylogenetic studies [19,20,36,54], and to
include a wider selection of LI818 proteins from the
green lineage. For the latter purpose, blast searches were
performed in the NCBI nr and EST databases, and the
retrieved sequences were treated as described above. We
added two sequences from the chlorarachniophyte (Rhizaria) Bigelowiella natans, which is thought to have
acquired its plastids through an independent secondary
endosymbiosis event with a green alga [55]; one
sequence from the dinophyte Karlodinium micrum; two
sequences from the unicellular green algae Mesostigma
viride (Charophyta) and Scenedesmus obliquus (Chlorophyta); one sequence from the haptophyte Pavlova
lutheri; two sequences from a second strain of Micromonas sp. (CCMP490); three sequences from Ostreococcus
sp. RCC809; one sequence each from O. tauri and V.
carteri (these had also been identified in our analysis of
the corresponding genomes); and three sequences from
the gymnosperm Picea sitchensis. The sequence corresponding to the first available CAB structure from
Pisum sativum [56] was included to enable homologybased three-dimensional modeling, but was later
replaced by the spinach protein mentioned below. A
complete list of sequences and accession numbers is
available in Additional file 2, and further LI818 proteins
are reported in the first paragraph of the results and discussion section, even though they were not included in
the phylogenetic analyses due to the high degree of
sequence similarity with other represented sequences.
Phylogenetic analyses

A phylogenetic tree was constructed for all sequences
except those of poplar and maize, which were highly
similar to those of A. thaliana, and those of O. lucimarinus, as they were highly similar to O. tauri. To this
aim, sequences were aligned using MAFFT [57] and the
“E-INS-i” strategy with default settings. Automatic alignments were then manually refined using Bioedit 7.0.9.0
[58], taking into consideration only the conserved
regions of the proteins for further analyses. A total of
131 residues were manually selected (see Additional file
3). In some cases, this resulted in two sequences with
100% sequence identity, and one of the identical
sequences was excluded for further analyses. In parallel,
an automatic selection of conserved residues was carried
out using the Gblocks algorithm [59]. Even with the
least stringent settings, this resulted in the selection of
only 53 residues. Phylogenetic analyses based on these
53 residues yielded similar tree topologies as the manual

selection (data not shown). CBPs and FCPs were considered stress-induced if they were identified as such in the
original publications, or in the case of E. siliculosus, if
the mean ratio stress/control for hyposaline-, hypersaline-, and oxidative stress reported in our previous study
was greater than 2, and the p-value (ANOVA) associated to this change < 0.05 [60].
Maximum likelihood trees were generated using
PhyML (bootstrapping with 250 iterations as well as
Approximate Likelihood-Ratio testing [61]). We chose
the “Blosum62” substitution model allowing gammadistributed rate heterogeneity over sites (4 categories) as
well as invariable sites, as this was shown to best represent our data using ProtTest [62] and the AIC criterion.
The results were complemented by bayesian inference
analysis using MrBayes [63]. Except for the use of “Blosum62” as prior for the substitution model and gammadistributed rate heterogeneity in the likelihood model
(see above), default parameters were applied. The analysis was run for 8,000,000 generations (samples were
taken every 100 generations). At this point, the average
standard deviation of split frequencies was stable at
approximately 0.03 and decreased no further. The first
25% of samples were discarded as burn in. The PhyML
tree was used as a basis to manually introduce targeted
modifications in the tree and to run the tests evaluating
different evolutionary scenarios on the origin of LI818
proteins. Different trees were tested using treepuzzle
[64] to calculate site-wise log-likelihood (same substitution model as above), and CONSEL [65] to perform the
Approximately Unbiased (AU, [66]) and the Weighted
Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests (WSH).
Sequence analysis and three-dimensional modeling

A multiple sequence alignment of the LI818-like
sequences was generated as described above, and manually refined using BioEdit, on the basis of the crystal
structure of the CAB from spinach (PDB code 1RWT;
[42]). The chain A of this structure was also used to generate a three dimensional (3D) model of the proteins
Cre_23 from C. reinhardtii and Esi_02 from E. siliculosus
using Modeller [67] with default parameters. The multiple sequence alignment and the 3D models were displayed using ESPript [68] and PyMOL [69], respectively.
