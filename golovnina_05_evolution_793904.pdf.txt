Abstract
Background: Merlin, the product of the Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene, belongs to the ezrinradixin-moesin (ERM) subgroup of the protein 4.1 superfamily, which links cell surface glycoproteins to the actin
cytoskeleton. While merlin's functional activity has been examined in mammalian and Drosophila models, little is
understood about its evolution, diversity, and overall distribution among different taxa.
Results: By combining bioinformatic and phylogenetic approaches, we demonstrate that merlin homologs are present
across a wide range of metazoan lineages. While the phylogenetic tree shows a monophyletic origin of the ERM family,
the origin of the merlin proteins is robustly separated from that of the ERM proteins. The derivation of merlin is thought
to be in early metazoa. We have also observed the expansion of the ERM-like proteins within the vertebrate clade, which
occurred after its separation from Urochordata (Ciona intestinalis). Amino acid sequence alignment reveals the absence
of an actin-binding site in the C-terminal region of all merlin proteins from various species but the presence of a
conserved internal binding site in the N-terminal domain of the merlin and ERM proteins. In addition, a more conserved
pattern of amino acid residues is found in the region containing the so-called "Blue Box," although some amino acid
substitutions in this region exist in the merlin sequences of worms, fish, and Ciona. Examination of sequence variability
at functionally significant sites, including the serine-518 residue, the phosphorylation of which modulates merlin's intramolecular association and function as a tumor suppressor, identifies several potentially important sites that are conserved
among all merlin proteins but divergent in the ERM proteins. Secondary structure prediction reveals the presence of a
conserved α-helical domain in the central to C-terminal region of the merlin proteins of various species. The conserved
residues and structures identified correspond to the important sites highlighted by the available crystal structures of the
merlin and ERM proteins. Furthermore, analysis of the merlin gene structures from various organisms reveals the
increase of gene length during evolution due to the expansion of introns; however, a reduction of intron number and
length appears to occur in the merlin gene of the insect group.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate a monophyletic origin of the merlin proteins with their root in the early metazoa.
The overall similarity among the primary and secondary structures of all merlin proteins and the conservation of several
functionally important residues suggest a universal role for merlin in a wide range of metazoa.

Background
The advancement in genome sequencing projects, the
accumulation of knowledge in bioinformatics, and the
molecular genetic analysis of genes and their functions in
a variety of model organisms provides us with an unprecedented opportunity to identify novel genes based on
sequences related to characterized genes [1]. This process
is conducted using pairwise sequence comparison with
the understanding that genes form families wherein
related sequences likely share similar functions. Although
initial identification of new genes may not yield a clear
indication of their respective functions, studies on their
evolution may allow validation of their sequence identity
and provide information on their putative functional
characteristics. For genes evolved from duplication and/or
adapted to different evolutionary niches during speciation, detailed sequence comparison can provide additional information regarding their biological and
biochemical characteristics [2].
Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a highly penetrant,
autosomal dominant disorder, whose hallmark is the
development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas [3,4].
The tumor suppressor gene associated with NF2 has been
identified and termed the neurofibromatosis type 2 gene
(NF2) [5,6]. The NF2 gene encodes a protein named merlin, for moesin-ezrin-radixin like protein, or schwannomin, a word derived from schwannoma, the most
prevalent tumor seen in NF2. For simplicity, we refer to
the NF2 gene product as merlin hereafter.
Merlin shares sequence similarity with the ezrin, radixin,
and moesin (ERM) proteins, which belong to the protein
4.1 superfamily of cytoskeleton-associated proteins that
link cell surface glycoproteins to the actin cytoskeleton
[7,8]. Like ERM proteins, merlin consists of three predicted structural domains [5,6,9]. The N-terminal
domain, termed the FERM (F for 4.1) domain, is highly
conserved among all members of the ERM family and is
important for interactions with cell surface glycoproteins,
including CD44 and intercellular adhesion molecules
[10-13]. Crystal structure analysis shows that the tertiary
structure of the FERM domain of merlin closely resembles
those of the FERM domain of moesin and radixin [14-18].
The FERM domain of merlin exists as a clover-shaped
molecule consisting of three structural subdomains A, B,
and C, which are homologous to lobes F1, F2, and F3 in
moesin and radixin. Subdomain A, composed of residues
20–100, possesses a ubiquitin-like fold. Subdomain B,
consisting of residues 101–215, folds itself into a topology like that of the acetyl-CoA-binding protein. Subdomain C, containing residues 216–313, adopts the
pleckstrin homology/phosphotyrosine-binding fold
found in a broad range of signaling molecules [14-16].
The second half of merlin contains a predicted α-helix

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/69

domain, which is also present in the ERM proteins [19].
Although the unique C-terminus of merlin lacks the conventional actin-binding domain found in the ERM proteins [20,21], merlin can directly bind actin using the
residues at the N-terminal domain and indirectly through
its association with βII-spectrin or fodrin [22-24].
The merlin and ERM proteins are thought to be key regulators of interactions between the actin cytoskeleton and
the plasma membrane in polarized cells. They act as
important members of signal transduction pathways that
control cell growth and participate in the sorting of membrane proteins during exocytic traffic [25,26]. However,
unlike the ERM proteins, merlin has a distinct function as
a tumor suppressor [27]. Growth suppression by merlin is
dependent on its ability to form intramolecular associations [28,29]. In this regard, merlin exists in an "open"
(inactive form) or "closed" (active growth-suppressive
form) conformation that is regulated by phosphorylation
[30-35].
While previous studies have focused primarily on the
functional analysis of merlin, limited information is available about its overall distribution across eukaryotes and
its evolution. A phylogenetic study indicates that the
FERM domains of ERM homologs from sea urchins,
Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and vertebrates share 74–82% amino acid identity and have about
60% identity with those of merlin [25,36-42]. These levels
of identity are exceptionally high, suggesting that the protein structures of the merlin and ERM proteins from these
species may be well-conserved. The most divergent ERM
proteins are found in tapeworms and schistosomes [3639]. The FERM domains of these parasite proteins share
only 44–58% similarity to their vertebrate homologs. The
high degree of structural conservation among these proteins points to possible similarities or functional redundancies. Intriguingly, no FERM domain-encoding genes
have been identified in the genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, implying that FERM domains evolved in
response to multicellularity, rather than as a cytoskeletal
component [25].
The goal of the present study was to expand our understanding of the taxonomic diversity of merlin and the phylogenetic relationships using experimentally annotated
and predicted sequences. By the integration of the BLASTbased analysis using the available partial and whole
genome sequences with phylogeny reconstruction, we
have generated an evolutionary tree for the entire ERMfamily members from various taxa and identified some
interesting details about their phylogenetic origin. In
addition, we compared sequence variability at functionally significant sites, including the major phosphorylation
site of merlin, predicted the secondary structure of the

merlin proteins of various species, and examined the
exon-intron structural evolution of the NF2 gene.

Results and Discussion
BLAST identification of merlin sequences
To identify putative merlin and ERM sequences in a wide
range of eukaryotes, we performed BLAST analysis of 15
available genome databases. By searching through all
annotated proteins and genome sequences, we identified
50 sequences from 30 species. Table 1 summarizes the full
list of the predicted and annotated merlin and ERM proteins identified, and their GenBank and available UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot accession numbers and related
resources. No merlin-like sequences were found in the
genomes of fungi, plants, and protozoa. While the
sequencing projects of the hard ticks are still ongoing at
The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR), amino acid
sequences deduced from partial cDNAs of salivary glands,
which share a similarity with the FERM domain of merlin,
have been noted from Rhipicephalus appendiculatus [43],
Amblyomma variegatum [44], and Boophilus microplus [45].
Assembly of predicted merlin sequences from whole
genome shotgun
To date, the genomes of Caenorhabditis remanei and Drosophila yakuba are represented by a set of contigs [46].
When contigs are ordered, oriented, and positioned with
respect to each other by mate-pair reads, they are
described as a scaffold. Scaffolds are the main product of
the Whole Genome Shotgun strategy and can be assigned
to chromosomes using chromosome-specific markers.
Although the extensive scaffolds for the genomes of
Caenorhabditis remanei and Drosophila yakuba are not currently available, we were able to assemble predictive protein sequences, which most resemble the merlin sequence
of the closely-related organism, Caenorhabditis elegans or
Drosophila melanogaster, respectively, using TBLASTN
search across the available sets of contigs. In the Drosophila
yakuba contig 49.37, we identified a predicted merlin
sequence, which is nearly identical to that of the Drosophila melanogaster protein with the exception of three
positions at the C-terminus, two substitutions at
Glu468→Asp and Asn579→Ser and an insertion of Lys at
position 575. Also, we found three Caenorhabditis remanei
contigs, 564.6, 2151.1, and 2151.2, which contained merlin-like sequences with similarity, ranging from 81% to
100%, to its Caenorhabditis elegans counterpart. It should
be noted that the deduced amino acid sequences were
assembled manually, and in some cases, only partial or
approximate amino acid sequences could be obtained.
Nevertheless, they were useful for the identification of the
definite gene in the respective genome and were valuable
for the following phylogenetic reconstruction in order to
validate the functional relationship and evolution of the
definite gene.

Construction of a phylogenetic tree for the ERM family of
proteins
To understand the origin and evolution of merlin, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the 50 proteins of the
ERM family, which were identified from 30 different taxa
(Table 1) using the neighbor-joining method [47,48]
combined with the molecular evolutionary genetics analysis program MEGA2 [49]. Three protein 4.1 sequences
from humans, mice, and zebrafish, respectively, were used
as an outgroup. By comparing the bootstrap support values, which denote the number of times a grouping occurs
out of 1,000 random samples from the alignment, we
constructed a phylogenetic tree for the ERM family of proteins (Figure 1). Based on this phylogenetic analysis, the
entire ERM family can be subdivided into the ERM clade
and the merlin clade. While both clades show a strongly
supported monophyletic origin, the merlin clade can be
robustly defined and separated from the ERM clade (the
bootstrap support value = 100). We identified a total of 22
sequences for the merlin clade and 28 sequences for the
ERM clade. The topology of the phylogenetic tree within
the merlin clade appears to agree with the general concept
of evolutionary history of speciation.

The merlin clade can be further divided into three groups
according to the order of derivation: worms, insects, and
Chordata, with the earliest separated genus, Ciona, in the
last taxonomic unit (Figure 1). The predicted merlin-like
sequence from Caenorhabditis remanei branched from that
of Caenorhabditis elegans, and similarly, Drosophila yakuba
diverged from its Drosophila melanogaster counterpart.
Both the "unnamed protein 1" of Tetraodon nigroviridis
and the "unknown protein" of Xenopus laevis from the
GenBank database are clustered in the Chordata merlinlike group with high bootstrap probabilities (Figure 1),
which confirms their identity as merlin homologs. The
protein fragment from Anopheles gambiae, which bears a
sequence similarity to merlin, is grouped together with
the Apis mellifera merlin-like protein by a bootstrap support value of 100.
Although the ERM-like proteins have been identified in
Taenia saginata, Schistosoma japonicum, Echinococcus granulosus, and Echinococcus multilocularis [36-39], we did not
find any merlin-like sequences in the genomes of these
species. The lack of merlin-like sequences in these parasite
genomes may be due to incomplete genome sequences in
the database; however, this explanation is unlikely
because the merlin-like sequence was also not observed in
the genome of Schistosoma mansoni, which has been rigorously studied [50]. Another possibility is that the absence
of merlin-like sequences in these organisms may reflect
their adaptation to a parasitic lifestyle and the reduction
of various organ systems. Alternatively, the merlin protein
may emerge later during evolution. Similarly, no merlin-

like sequence was found in the complete genomes of protozoa, fungi, and plants. Based on these results, we suppose that the derivation of merlin occurred in the early
metazoa after its separation from flatworms.
As illustrated in the ERM clade in Figure 1, the ERM-like
proteins found in parasites can be grouped together but
form a separate branch from the rest of ERM proteins.
Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the clustering of the
"unnamed protein 2" of Tetraodon nigroviridis with the
Fugu rubripes radixin protein defines it as a radixin-like
protein. It should be noted that the two predicted ERM
proteins, erm1a and erm1b of Caenorhabditis elegans [51],
may represent different transcript variants of the same
gene (also see below).

Furthermore, we have observed the evident expansion of
the ERM-like ancestor in vertebrates (Figure 1). Since the
ERM homolog of Ciona emerged prior to the vertebrate
clade, it appears that the first duplication of the vertebrate
ERM sequence occurred after its divergence from Ciona.
Subsequent expansion within this sub-family has led to
the present existence of three related groups of proteins,
ezrin, radixin and moesin; among which, the ezrin group
is the most ancient. Such an expanded complement may
only be common to the ERM proteins of vertebrates
because other metazoa have only one predicted ERM-like
homolog [52-56]. Curiously, the increasing number of
ERM members that occurred within the vertebrate clade
paralleled the evolutionary complexity of the organism. It
will be important to understand how these proteins

Sequence alignments reveal conservation of several functionally important residues, including the major phosphorylation site of
Figure 4
the merlin group
Sequence alignments reveal conservation of several functionally important residues, including the major phosphorylation site of
the merlin group.

Figures 2, 3, and 4. Previously, the conservation of the Nterminal FERM domain among human ERM proteins and
their functional importance were described [10-13]. In
our alignment, we showed that this conservation
extended to the merlin and ERM proteins of various species for which sequences were available to date. These data
suggest a universal role for the presence of the FERM
domain during evolution and further imply an existence
of certain evolutionary constraints on the changes of their
amino acid residues.
Although merlin lacks the C-terminal actin-binding site
found in ERM proteins [7,20,21,57], it can directly interact with the actin cytoskeleton [22,58] or indirectly bind
via the actin-binding protein βII spectrin/fodrin [23,24].
Sequence alignment showed extensive amino acid variability in the C-terminal region of the merlin proteins of
various species, while a noncontiguous stretch of 25
amino acid residues, including the well-defined actinbinding site, was reliably aligned among all predicted
ERM proteins with the exception of the "unnamed protein
2" of Tetraodon nigroviridis (Figure 2). According to the
phylogenetic tree, the "unnamed protein 2" of Tetraodon
nigroviridis is classified in the radixin group (Figure 1), and
its sequence visibly differs from other radixin proteins
only at the C-terminus. The reason for this sequence variability is presently unknown. It may be due to an inaccuracy in sequence assembly from the scaffold. Alternatively,
the "unnamed 2 protein" may possess a unique characteristic and will be of considerable interest for functional
comparison with other radixin proteins.

Sequence variability at the C-terminal domain of the merlin proteins of various species appears to be high, while
some conservation can be found within separate taxonomic groups such as vertebrates, insects, and worms
(Figure 2 and Additional File 1). A part of the C-terminal
region is absent in Fugu rubripes, Danio rerio, C. briggsae,
and Brugia malayi. This may be due to partial assembly of
the protein sequences, as all of them were predicted by
bioinformatics using the available genomes and cDNA
sequences. Alternatively, the lack of conservation in the Cterminal region of merlin in these species may imply that
this region does not share the same function. In the
remaining organisms, the C-terminal amino acid residues
have a specific charge distribution, in spite of decreased
hydrophilicity, when compared with the C-terminal part
of moesin [15]; however, they likely form structures similar to the B, C, and D helices found in moesin.
Unlike ERM proteins, two regions (residues 1–27 and
280–323) in the N-terminal half of merlin have been
mapped that are sufficient for binding to F-actin [59,60].
The first 17 amino acids in the N-terminus of human merlin are present in the merlin proteins of various species
but not in any ERM proteins (see Additional File 1). The
merlin proteins of higher vertebrates contain these residues, eight of which are absent in the merlin proteins of
other organisms. Crystal structure analysis suggests that
the structure of these extreme N-terminal residues of merlin is disordered in solution but likely becomes ordered as
merlin binds to some effector targets [17]. Our sequence
alignment indicates that the conservation in the extreme

Page 9 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:69

N-terminus of merlin extends to the first 27 residues. The
distribution of specific positively-charged residues also
appears to be conserved in this N-terminal portion of the
merlin proteins of lower vertebrates and insects. These
results suggest that the first 27 amino acids of merlin serve
as a common protein-binding motif. It is noteworthy that
a similar sequence can be found in the ERM-like protein
of Ciona; however, the N-terminal region of the Ciona protein contains ten positively-charged, basic amino acids,
which may affect the binding to actin and/or other proteins (Additional File 1).
The internal actin-binding site, containing residues 280–
323 in the N-terminal half of merlin, was found to be
highly conserved among all merlin and ERM proteins analyzed, particularly the last 30 amino acid residues (Additional File 1). This region contains an extended helix at
the beginning of the α-helical domain and its importance
is supported by the identification of several disease-causing mutations (S315F, L316F, L316W, Q324L), which
were predicted to destabilize the α-helical segment and
disrupt its hydrogen bonding with subdomain A [16-18].
In addition, these residues have been shown to associate
with F-actin in moesin [61,62] and to contribute to the
ICAM-2-binding site in radixin [14].
Previously, LaJeunesse et al. [63] identified seven functionally
important
amino
acid
residues
(170YQMTPEM177) in the N-terminal domain of Drosophila merlin, called the "Blue Box." These seven amino
acids are identical between the human and Drosophila
merlin proteins but differ from the ERM proteins.
Sequence comparison revealed a more conserved pattern
of the Blue Box; all seven amino acid residues of the Blue
Box were found to be identical in the merlin sequences
from vertebrates, fruit flies, and honeybees (Figure 3);
however, several amino acid substitutions were found in
the Blue Box of worms, fish, and Ciona. The most interesting substitutions were found in the merlin-like protein of
Caenorhabditis from 174ThrProGlu176 to 174SerAlaAsp176. It
is noteworthy that the methionine residue at position 177
in the Blue Box is conserved among all merlin proteins
but not in the ERM proteins. These results further corroborate the functional importance of the seven amino acids
in the Blue Box [63].
According to the crystal structure of the FERM domain in
human merlin, the Blue Box residues are located in helix
α3B of subdomain B [18] and form a defined area that is
located on the surface of the protein [17]. Intriguingly, the
three-dimensional conformation of merlin's Blue Box
region is similar to that of the equivalent region in radixin
[18], suggesting that regions in addition to the Blue Box
are required for merlin to function as a tumor suppressor.
Note that regions closely adjacent to the Blue Box-equiva-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/69

lent residues in human ERM proteins have been shown to
participate in the N-terminal to C-terminal intramolecular
interaction and ligand-binding, enabling increased
mobility and structural changes in the activated FERM
domain [14-16,64]. In light of the functional importance
of the Blue Box in Drosophila merlin, its sequence conservation during evolution, and its location on the surface of
merlin, the Blue Box probably participates in specific protein-protein interactions and contributes to other activities of merlin.
As in ERM proteins, phosphorylation affects the subcellular localization and intra- and inter-molecular associations of merlin [13,30-32]. In addition, it modulates the
ability of merlin to suppress cell growth [34,35]. Two
phosphorylation sites have been mapped to the Ser518 and
Thr576 residues in the merlin protein. Phosphorylation on
Ser518 has been shown to modulate the ability of merlin to
form intramolecular associations and to bind to critical
effectors important for growth suppression [34,35]. In
contrast, phosphorylation on the Thr576 residue has no
effect on merlin's functional activity, while phosphorylation on this residue is important for the function of ERM
proteins [57,65-67]. Sequence alignment shows that the
Ser518 residue is conserved across all merlin proteins of
various species with the exception of the fruit fly and the
worm, which contain a related threonine residue at the
corresponding position (Figure 4). Since both the serine
and threonine residues can be phosphorylated, we suggest
that the corresponding threonine residue in merlin proteins of the fly and the worm may act as a phosphorylation site.
Gutmann et al. showed that mutations within the predicted α-helical region of the human merlin protein had
little effect on its function, whereas those in its N- or C-terminus rendered the protein inactive as a negative growth
regulator [28,29]. Specifically, five naturally occurring
missense mutations, L64P, K79E, E106G, L535P and
Q538P, were found to inactivate merlin function. Interestingly, we found that the Leu64 and Lys79 residues were conserved among the merlin and ERM proteins of various
species (Figure 4). According to the crystal structure of the
FERM domain of merlin, the L64P substitution would create a cavity in the hydrophobic core of subdomain A and
affect its β-sheet structure [17,18]. The significance of this
structural information was further supported by the finding that the L64P mutation impaired the ability of merlin
to form an intramolecular complex between its two N-terminal interaction sites [28]. Moreover, the L64P mutant
lost its ability to bind the cytoplasmic tail of CD44; this
interaction correlates with the ability of merlin to function as a growth suppressor [29].

The Lys79 residue is situated at the end of helix α4A, and
mutation at this residue (K79E) may cause the formation
of a salt bridge with its neighboring Lys76 residue, which is
normally hydrogen bonded to Tyr66 in helix α3A [17].
Two equivalent lysine residues, Lys60 and Lys63, were
found in module F1 of moesin and were predicted to be
involved in specific protein interactions, consequently
changing the structure of an activated molecule [15,16].
Together with a group of positively-charged amino acids
at the beginning of the helix module F3 (R275, K278,
R279), these lysine residues interact with the negativelycharged residues (342-REKEE-346) in the C-terminal
region [16]. Importantly, most of the homologous positively-charged residues located between lobes F1 and F3
in the radixin protein have been shown to bind to inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) [15]. In addition to Lys79, the
Lys76 residue was also found to be highly conserved
among various merlin and ERM proteins with the exception of the worm protein, which has a Gln76 instead of
Lys76 (Figure 4 and Additional File 1). Also, the ERM-like
proteins of parasites Taenia saginata, Echinococcus granulosus, and Echinococcus multilocularis contain an Arg76 residue, which is also a basic amino acid residue and may be
capable of participating in interactions similar to those of
the corresponding lysine residue. On the contrary, in the
JF2 protein of Shistosoma mansoni, the position equivalent
to Lys60 of moesin is occupied by a glutamic acid residue,
and no conservation of residues 275, 278, and 279 in the
JF2 protein was found, suggesting a unique structural feature for this Shistosoma protein.
Several other naturally-occurring missense mutations on
human merlin, including E106G, L535P and Q538P, have
also been found to affect its functional activity [29,68].
Our sequence alignment revealed that the Glu106, Leu535,
and Gln538 residues were conserved among the merlin
proteins of the Chordata group (Figure 4), highlighting
the general importance of these residues for merlin function. Similar to the L64P mutation described above, the
E106G mutation resulted in impaired intramolecular
associations of merlin [29]. However, the Leu64 residue is
highly conserved among all merlin and ERM proteins of
various species, while Glu106 is conserved only in the merlin proteins of Chordata and worms. In the crystal structure of the FERM domain of merlin, the Glu106 residue is
located at the linker A-B (α1'B) and participates in the
inter-subdomain interaction by forming a hydrogen bond
with the Lys289 residue [17,18]. This interaction may enable subdomain B to rotate closer to subdomain C. Intriguingly, Lys289 is conserved only among the merlin proteins
of mammals, chickens, frogs, honeybees, and mosquitoes
(Additional File 1). In the merlin proteins of other species,
a negatively-charged aspartic or glutamic acid occupies
this position, except in fish. Instead of lysine, an arginine
residue was found in the homologous position of all ERM

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/69

proteins (e.g., Arg273 for moesin), except for the ERM-like
proteins in parasites (Additional File 1). This Arg273 residue, located at the beginning of the helix of subdomain
F3, lies in a specific cleft between subdomains F1 and F3
with the positively-charged R275, K278, and R279 residues. According to the structure of radixin, the IP3-binding site is located at this basic cleft [14]. This region in the
moesin protein has also been shown to interact with its Cterminal domain [16].
It should be mentioned that residues that are conserved in
the merlin proteins, but not in the ERM proteins, of various species may be important for elucidating the functional difference between the merlin and ERM proteins.
We found that the glutamic acid residue at position 204 of
human merlin was conserved among all merlin proteins
(Figure 3). In contrast, variable and uncharged amino
acids were found at the corresponding position of the
ERM proteins. Crystal structure of the FERM domain of
human merlin shows that the Glu204 residue lies in the
beginning of helix α4B and is included in a specific stretch
of amino acids in subdomain B [17]. By sequence alignment of human merlin and ERM proteins, about 70
amino acids, including this specific stretch of residues,
which are unique to merlin but different in ERM proteins,
were identified (see Additional File 1). The majority of
these amino acids can be subdivided into three clusters;
each of them is specific to its corresponding subdomain
and is located on the surface of the protein. These results
suggest that these 70 amino acids likely take part in protein-protein interactions. Note that the conserved stretch
of amino acids in subdomain B also includes the functionally important "Blue Box" discussed above.
Similarly, the isoleucine residue at position 546 was
found to be conserved among the merlin proteins of various species, while a leucine residue was present in the corresponding position in all ERM proteins (Figure 2). The
residue homologous to Leu529 in the C-terminal domain
of moesin is located at the end of helix A with other
hydrophobic residues, tightly contacting the hydrophobic
faces of helices B and D of subdomain F2 [15]. Although
the information about such an interaction in merlin is
presently unavailable, additional crystal structure analysis
should allow us to better understand the importance of
this amino acid residue. In addition, it will be interesting
to test whether mutations in the conserved amino acid
residues identified in this study could affect protein function.
Predicted secondary structure of merlin and comparative
analysis of the predicted α-helical region

of ERM proteins contained approximately 200 residues
that were predicted to be mostly α-helical [19]. To exam-

of the merlin mRNA sequences available in the database are shown in nucleotides (nt) and the lengths of the predicted merlin

that Northern blot analysis detected the rat and mouse NF2 mRNAs of about 4.5 kb, indicating that the sizes of the rodent
NF2 mRNAs shown here are not full-length. The asterisk (*) denotes the exon-intron structure of Brugia malayi predicted from

ine whether there was a similar structure present in all
merlin proteins, we analyzed 21 merlin sequences from
various organisms and predicted their secondary structures using the JPRED program [69]. The results of such an
analysis for six representative species are presented in Figure 5. The predicted locations of α-helices and β-sheets in
the N-terminal domain support the experimental findings
from the structural analysis of the FERM domain of
human merlin protein [18]. In addition, a predicted αhelical structure in the central-to-C-terminal region was
found to be conserved among the merlin proteins of various species analyzed. Previously, it was shown that a truncated merlin protein of Drosophila, containing residues 1–
600, lost the ability to localize to the cytoplasm and was
concentrated at the plasma membrane [63]. However, two
smaller truncated proteins, consisting of residues 1–350
or 1–375, were only loosely associated with the plasma

membrane. These results suggest that the predicted α-helical region of merlin is important for its intracellular localization. Since almost the entire α-helical domain was
absent in these truncated proteins, we suggest that it may
contain a determinant for membrane association. This
notion is further supported by the observation that additional truncated proteins, containing residues 1–300 or
missing almost the entire α-helical domain, were diffusely
localized to the cytoplasm.
In human merlin, the predicted α-helical structure is situated between residues K312 and K478 (Figure 5 and Additional File 1). The N-terminal border of this structure was
clearly recognized for 21 merlin sequences analyzed,
whereas the C-terminal boundary could be traced only up
to Urochordata (Ciona) and Nematoda (Caenorhabditis).

sequences, contains a high density of charged amino acids
(from about 25% in Ciona to greater than 40% in vertebrates). Sequence alignment reveals 19 conserved amino
acid residues in this predicted α-helical domain (Additional File 1). The amino acid identity for the predicted αhelical domain within each phylogenetic group is as follows: 1) Genus Drosophila (D. melanogaster and D. yakuba)
– 99% (one amino acid substitution), 2) Genus
Caenorhabditis (C. elegans, C. briggsae, and C. remanie) –
85.7%, 3) Genus Ciona (C. intestinalis and C. savignyi) –
71.7%, 4) vertebrates – 63.5%, and 5) mammals – 90%.
Taken together, these results indicate that the merlin proteins of various species contain a conserved α-helical
domain in the central to C-terminal region.
Exon-intron structural evolution of the merlin gene
Recent progress in automated computational analysis of
partially and completely sequenced genomes using a gene
prediction method and the analysis of expressed sequence
tag (EST) has provided considerable opportunities not
only to describe novel genes but also their exon-intron
structures. Such an approach also allows the examination
of the presence of different splicing variants/isoforms. To
understand the evolution of the exon-intron structure of
the merlin gene, we assembled all available NF2 generelated sequences from various taxa. Using the sequences
of proteins, mRNAs, and combined contigs [70], we established the structure of the merlin-like gene for Brugia
malayi, which consists of 12 exons and 11 introns (Figure
6). Analogously, the homolog of the NF2 gene in
Caenorhabditis elegans was found to contain 11 exons and
10 introns. It should be mentioned that the two NF2-like

sequences, nfm-1a and nfm-1b of Caenorhabditis elegans,
differ from each other only by the sequence of the last
exon (Additional File 1), suggesting that they represent
cDNA isoforms.
As shown in Figure 6, the general arrangement of the merlin gene structure is conserved among mammalian species, especially at the region that encodes the N-terminal
domain, albeit the length of the genes may differ slightly.
The human NF2 gene consists of 17 exons and spans
about 95 kb of DNA [5,6,71,72]. NF2 transcripts undergo
alternative splicing, generating multiple isoforms [72-79].
Isoform I, missing exon 16, and isoform II, containing all
17 exons, are the two predominant species. As the result
of alternative splicing, isoform 1 encodes a 595 amino
acid protein. Isoform II differs from isoform I only at the
C-terminus. Insertion of exon 16 into the mRNA provides
a new stop codon, resulting in a 590 amino acid protein
that is identical to isoform I over the first 579 residues.
Because of the presence of a long 3' untranslated region,
the longest NF2 isoform I RNA, containing the sequence
from all 17 exons, is about 6.1 kb [72]. The merlin genes
of other mammalian species, Rattus norvegicus, Canis
familiaris, Mus musculus and Pan troglodytes, contain 16
exons (Figures 6 and 7). In addition, alternatively spliced
merlin isoforms have been found in rodent species [8082]. On the contrary, the structure of the merlin genes of
Gallus gallus and Fugu rubripes are arranged differently
from those of mammalian species, with 15 and 14 exons
spanning much shorter DNAs of only about 25 kb and
12.3 kb, respectively (Figure 6). Although the NF2 gene of
Fugu rubripes has not yet been completely assembled, we

predict that it lacks the sequences of the first and the last
exons of the mammalian NF2 gene based on our sequence
alignment (see Additional File 1).
In spite of the presence of 16 exons and the size of transcript similar to those found in some vertebrates, the gene
for the merlin-like protein of Ciona intestinalis is relatively
small with only about 4.3 kb (Figure 6). This tendency
towards reduction of intron length and number continues
to be seen in the merlin gene of worms and insects (Figures 6 and 7). The gene for the merlin-like protein of
Caenorhabditis elegans, consisting of 11 exons, spans about
4.7-kb DNA, and that of Brugia malayi, containing 12
exons, is about 5.5 kb in length. The NF2 homolog of Drosophila melanogaster and the gene for the merlin-like protein of Apis mellifera are only about 2.9 kb, the smallest in
the merlin clade, and consist of 5 and 8 exons, respectively
(Figure 6). Interestingly, some conservation of the positions of homologous introns can be found in the NF2
gene from various species (Figure 7); however, the sizes of
their introns are variable. Such an evolutionary conservation of homologous introns implies that the presence of
regulatory sequences in the introns to regulate the transcriptional event.
Unlike the sizes and structures of the merlin or merlin-like
genes in various organisms, the lengths of the merlin proteins and transcripts have not changed very much during
evolution (Figure 6). Moreover, several functionally
important domains of merlin also remain conserved.
Since the merlin protein of the insect emerged after deviation from that of the worm, which was anciently derived
from the common ancestor (Figure 1), it appears that the
decrease in gene size and exon number occurred specifically within the insect group. This branch of merlin evolution is likely to develop independently and in the
opposite direction from those more recently developed
merlin proteins of Chordata. Parallel evolution towards
the increase in merlin gene size and exon number
between the worm and Chordata appears to be less likely.
Thus, it is possible that the common ancestor for the merlin genes of the worm, the insect, and Chordata may contain a few more exons. During evolution, reduction of
introns and/or fusion of exons occur within the insect
group.
It is evident that the genome of the insect is more complicated than that of the worm. The simplification of the
merlin gene structure in the insect is unique and may have
a functional significance. This observation may explain
the lack of splicing variants of the NF2 homolog in Drosophila, in contrast to those merlin isoforms found in
mammals [72-82] and in Caenorhabditis elegans as we predicted in this study.

Conclusion
We have conducted the phylogenetic analysis of merlin
diversity across metazoan genomes using the experimentally annotated and predicted sequences in conjunction
with bioinformatic tools. We show that the merlin proteins have a monophyletic origin with a root in the early
metazoa. We have also established the expansion of the
ERM-like ancestors within the vertebrate clade that
occurred after its separation from Urochordata. Several
potentially important sites that are conserved among all
merlin proteins but are divergent in the ERM members
have been identified. As supported by the crystal structure
data, these conserved residues are likely to be important
for merlin function. Analysis of the evolution of the merlin gene structure reveals the existence of common splicing variants in human and Caenorhabditis elegans. While a
trend toward the increase of gene length during evolution
was observed, a reduction of intron number and length
appears to occur in the merlin gene of the insect group.
Taken together, our results have important implications
for the evolution of the merlin proteins and their possible
functional variability in different taxa.

Methods
BLAST search
Initial sequences of genes and proteins of interest from
various organisms were identified from the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database
[83] using the BLAST algorithm [84]. We then searched
the desirable sequences across genomic databases of completely or partially sequenced genomes available at The
Sanger Institute [85] and The Institute for Genomic
Research (TIGR; [86]). Also, we investigated other available sequence databases that contain information for specific organisms. The sources of sequences of the predicted
or experimentally annotated merlin and ERM proteins are
summarized in Table 1.

To obtain the entire amino acid sequence of an annotated
protein, we used UniProt from Universal Protein Resource
[87]. The erythrocyte membrane proteins 4.1 sequences of
Homo sapiens (GenBank: CAI21970), Mus musculus (GenBank: NP_001006665), and Danio rerio (GenBank:
AAQ97985) were also included in the analysis as an outgroup. Because of the presence of many non-conserved
and large introns in the genes of interest, we conducted
BLAST search using TBLASTN alignment algorithm in the
cases where no protein sequences were available.
Alignments and phylogeny
The CLUSTAL_X program [88] was used to align the characterized or predicted protein sequences from different
species. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the
MEGA2.1 program [49].

Secondary structure prediction
The secondary structure prediction program JPRED [69]
was used to predict the secondary structure of each merlin
protein from various species. This program uses physicalchemical properties of the amino acid sequence and neural network for recognition of α-helices and β-sheets.
