Abstract
Background: The highly homologous PE_PGRS (Proline-glutamic acid_polymorphic GC-rich repetitive sequence) genes
are members of the PE multigene family which is found only in mycobacteria. PE genes are particularly abundant within
the genomes of pathogenic mycobacteria where they seem to have expanded as a result of gene duplication events.
PE_PGRS genes are characterized by their high GC content and extensive repetitive sequences, making them prone to
recombination events and genetic variability.
Results: Comparative sequence analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis genes PE_PGRS17 (Rv0978c) and PE_PGRS18
(Rv0980c) revealed a striking genetic variation associated with this typical tandem duplicate. In comparison to the M.
tuberculosis reference strain H37Rv, the variation (named the 12/40 polymorphism) consists of an in-frame 12-bp
insertion invariably accompanied by a set of 40 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that occurs either in PE_PGRS17
or in both genes. Sequence analysis of the paralogous genes in a representative set of worldwide distributed tubercle
bacilli isolates revealed data which supported previously proposed evolutionary scenarios for the M. tuberculosis complex
(MTBC) and confirmed the very ancient origin of "M. canettii" and other smooth tubercle bacilli. Strikingly, the identified
polymorphism appears to be coincident with the emergence of the post-bottleneck successful clone from which the
MTBC expanded. Furthermore, the findings provide direct and clear evidence for the natural occurrence of gene
conversion in mycobacteria, which appears to be restricted to modern M. tuberculosis strains.
Conclusion: This study provides a new perspective to explore the molecular events that accompanied the evolution,
clonal expansion, and recent diversification of tubercle bacilli.

Background
Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains (MTBC) are the
causative agents of tuberculosis (TB), a disease that has a
considerable detrimental impact on human and animal
health worldwide [1]. This group of slow growing pathogens includes the classical M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. africanum, M. microti, as well as the newly recognized MTBC
members, M. pinnipedii and M. caprae species. M. tuberculosis remains one of the most successful and adaptable
pathogens known to mankind despite the availability of a
vaccine and effective antimicrobial agents. This adaptability certainly reflects a very ancient and prolific evolutionary history.
With the availability of complete mycobacterial genome
sequences, whole-genome comparative sequence analyses
were possible and resulted in the identification of
sequence polymorphisms, that greatly inform our understanding of the evolutionary process of the MTBC [2-14].
It is now assumed that M. tuberculosis (the major etiological agent of human TB) and M. bovis (having a wide host
range) both arose from a common ancestor [15,16]. It has
also become apparent that the M. africanum-M. microti lineage represents a phylogenetic bridge between M. tuberculosis and M. bovis, whereas "M. canettii", a rare
phenotypically unusual tubercle bacillus, appears to be
closest to the common progenitor of the MTBC [17,18].
Recent studies confirmed that "M. canettii" and other
smooth tubercle bacilli are representatives of pre-bottleneck lineages and that the progenitor species (the socalled M. prototuberculosis), from which the MTBC
emerged, might have coexisted with early hominids
[19,20].
Completion of the genome sequence of M. tuberculosis
strain H37Rv [2], revealed that a major source of genetic
variation in this species could be associated with two large
gene families encoding acidic, asparagine- or glycine-rich
proteins referred to as PE (n = 99) and PPE (n = 68). These
multigene families represent approximately 10% of the
coding capacity of the genome and are characterized by
their high GC content and extensive repetitive structure.
Both families have been divided into subgroups, of which
the PE_PGRS subfamily (n = 61) of the PE family is particularly polymorphic and found to be enriched in essential
genes [21]. Although the function of the members of this
gene subfamily is currently unknown, the PE_PGRS genes
are strongly suspected to be associated with antigenic and
genetic variability as well as virulence [22-31]. It is
thought that members of the PE/PPE multigene families
might frequently undergo genetic remodelling by gene
duplication, recombination, and/or strand slippage
mechanisms because of the presence of a large number of
repeat sequences within these genes [2]. In the current
study, we focused on a prominent polymorphism motif

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/107

that occurs within two adjacent PE_PGRS genes, and provide evidence for its association with both early and recent
evolutionary events leading to a new PE_PGRS-based perspective to dissect the evolution of tubercle bacilli.

Results
Comparative sequence analysis of contiguous PE genes
Since the large number of homologous M. tuberculosis PE
genes seem to have arisen by multiple gene duplication
events, it is very difficult to determine duplication history.
We thus focussed our comparative sequence analysis on
PE genes that are situated adjacent to each other in the M.
tuberculosis H37Rv genome, as these tandem duplications
(those where the two copies of the duplicated region are
immediately adjacent to one another in the same orientation), could signify real duplicates. Fourteen neighbouring PE genes (11 apparent duplicates and 3 apparent
triplicates) were identified throughout the H37Rv
genome. About half of the contiguous PE sequences display more than 30% overall amino acid sequence similarity with their neighbouring PE gene member (Figure 1). As
expected, a higher degree of similarity was associated with
the conserved N-terminal PE region of the gene (Additional file 1), as previously reported [2]. Genes with low
amino acid similarity were excluded from further analyses
due to an uncertainty concerning their origin.

Further scrutiny of the nucleotide and amino acid alignments, showed that the PE_PGRS17 (Rv0978c) and
PE_PGRS18 (Rv0980c) genes (Figure 2A) shared the highest identity, indicating that they may represent a true
duplication event. Within these two genes, we could identify 2 major alignable coding regions of 168 (MAR1) and
162 (MAR2) amino acids, with a similarity of 98% and
90%, respectively (Figure 2B). These genes thus fulfilled
the criteria used previously to define the bacterial paranome [32] and should be regarded as a typical tandem
duplicate in spite of being separated by two overlapping,
non-associated, non-PE genes (Rv0979c – encoding a
hypothetical protein of unknown function and Rv0979A
– encoding a probable 50S ribosomal protein L32 rpmF).
The first alignable coding region starts at the first codon
and extends beyond the PE region, while the second maps
to the highly repetitive and GC rich (and usually very variable) PGRS C-terminal extension. PE_PGRS18 is larger
than PE_PGRS17 essentially because of the presence of
two extra in-frame nucleotide stretches, the first (222 nt)
is located between the two major alignable coding regions
and, the second (168 nt) represents an extra C-terminal
extension (Figure 2B). Further inspection of the upstream
non coding region of both genes revealed a nearly perfect
homology starting at the nucleotide position -235. Furthermore, a BLASTN search performed against the whole
genome of M. tuberculosis H37Rv identified another
PE_PGRS gene, PE_PGRS45 (Rv2615c), sharing 98%

identity through nucleotides -235 to 506 with
PE_PGRS17 and 98% identity through -235 to 595 with
PE_PGRS18. PE_PGRS45, which is located approximately
2.6 MB distal in the genome, is thus clearly a paralog of
PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18, and is either the progenitor
of these two genes or was duplicated from one of them. In
a recent study, the 3 PE_PGRS orthologs were shown to
share 5 nts at polymorphic positions lying upstream of
their coding sequences [33], thus confirming their evolutionary link. Sequence analyses of the genome sequence
of the phylogenetically closest non-tuberculous mycobacterial species, M. marinum, showed that its genome was
devoid of both the PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18
orthologs (See Additional file 3), as well as lacking the
orthologue for PE_PGRS45 (data not shown). As these
genes were also found to be absent from other species of
mycobacteria (e.g. M. leprae, M. ulcerans, and M. avium
paratuberculosis-see Additional file 3), the duplication of

these three PE_PGRS genes thus seems to have taken place
only after the divergence of the tubercle bacilli.
Identification of a prominent genetic variation in PE_PGRS17 and
PE_PGRS18 coding sequences
Alignment of PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18 with their corresponding published sequences (M. tuberculosis reference
strains CDC1551 and 210, and M. bovis AF2122/97)
revealed a prominent genetic variation associated with the
major alignable coding region 1 that was either restricted
to PE_PGRS17 (M. bovis and M. tuberculosis strain 210) or
shared by both PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18 genes (M.
tuberculosis CDC1551) (Figure 3A). In comparison to the
genome of the M. tuberculosis reference strain H37Rv, this
genetic variation (termed the 12/40 polymorphism) consisted of a 12-nucleotide in-frame insertion accompanied
by 40 SNPs dispersed along a DNA stretch of 135 nucleotides (Figure 3B), encompassing the junction between

the PE and PGRS regions of the gene sequence (Figure
3A). This variation results in a 4-amino acid insertion and
15 amino acid changes. In contrast, although PE_PGRS45
shared the MAR1 region (which contains the 12/40 polymorphism) with PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18, no polymorphism occurred in the orthologs of this gene in the
abovementioned sequenced strains (H37Rv, CDC1551,
210, as well as M. bovis AF2122/97).
Distribution of the 12/40 polymorphism throughout a
worldwide collection of tubercle bacilli
Based on the above observations, we decided to extend
our analysis to an additional group of 98 genetically

diverse and worldwide distributed tubercle bacilli. This
group consisted of M. tuberculosis H37Ra, 38 other M.
tuberculosis strains sensu stricto, 19 M. bovis strains, 1 M.
bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) strain (Danish strain,
Statens Serum Institute), 22 M. africanum strains, 10 M.
microti strains, 1 dassie bacillus, 1 M. caprae strain, 1 M.
pinnipedii strain, 2 "M. canettii" strains, and 2 smooth
tubercle bacilli strains (See Additional file 4, highlighted
in yellow). For this purpose, the DNA sequence encompassing nucleotides 31 to 712 (numbering according to
the M. tuberculosis H37Rv sequence) for both PE_PGRS17
and PE_GRS18 was determined in all these tubercle bacilli
strains. The multiple sequence alignment (Figure 4)

showed the absence, in both genes, of the 12/40 polymorphism in M. tuberculosis H37Ra, the two "M. canettii"
strains and in one smooth tubercle bacillus isolate. For the
second smooth tubercle bacillus isolate, we have been
able to amplify only PE_PGRS18 which was found to be
devoid of such a polymorphism. Strikingly, all strains of
the M. africanum-M. microti-M. caprae-M. pinnipedii-M.
bovis lineage (including M. bovis BCG), as well as the
ancestral (TbD1+) and PGG1 strains of M. tuberculosis,
harbor the 12/40 polymorphism in only their
PE_PGRS17 gene sequence and not in PE_PGRS18. This
finding was supported by analysis of the sequenced whole
genome of M. microti strain OV254 (data not shown). In
contrast, the pool of M. tuberculosis bacilli belonging to
PGG2 and PGG3 appears as a mix of 2 subpopulations;
one showing the variation uniquely in PE_PGRS17, while
the second displays the genetic change in both paralogs.
Interestingly, similar to the PGG2 epidemic M. tuberculosis
reference strain CDC1551, a PGG2 outbreak-associated
Tunisian M. tuberculosis Haarlem3 strain [34] displayed
the 12/40 polymorphism in both PE_PGRS paralogs.
Development of a reverse hybridization-based assay for
the detection of the 12/40 polymorphism and confirmation
of its non-random distribution throughout the
evolutionary history of the MTBC
In order to be able to rapidly test for the presence or
absence of the 12/40 polymorphism, we devised a simple
reverse-hybridization-based assay, named the PEGAssay
(PE_PGRS Grouping Assay). This consists of two biotinylated PCR products, encompassing the 12/40 polymophism, each specific to the PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18
sequences from each sample. The labeled amplicons were
allowed to react independently with a 5' aminated 24-mer
oligonucleotide probe, representing the 12 nt insertion
and the 12 downstream nucleotides of the 12/40 polymorphism. Using this assay, we determined the distribution pattern of the 12/40 polymorphism within
additional tubercle bacilli strains, known to have a critical
position in the evolutionary history of this group of pathogens ("M. canettii" and ancestral M. tuberculosis strains),
and in a larger collection of strains representing the 3 PGG
groups recovered from Africa, Europe, North- and SouthAmerica. As shown in Figure 5, no hybridization occurred
with either M. tuberculosis H37Rv or its avirulent derived
strain H37Ra, while two hybridization spots are apparent
for those strains harboring the 12/40 polymorphism in
both PE_PGRS paralogs. As expected, only one reacting
dot corresponding to the PE_PGRS17 amplicon could be
seen for strains where the 12/40 polymorphism is
restricted to this PE_PGRS gene. Compilation of the
sequence data with those of the reverse hybridization
assay (See Additional file 4) revealed that (i) all "M. canettii" strains (n = 6) and one smooth tubercle bacillus isolate are devoid of the 12/40 polymorphism in both

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/107

PE_PGRS paralogs, (ii) all strains of the M. africanum-M.
microti-M. bovis and their related subspecies (n = 98) harbor the polymorphism motif exclusively in their
PE_PGRS17 gene sequence (+/-), (iii) all PGG1 (ancestral
and modern) M. tuberculosis strains (n = 108) associate
with the M. africanum-M. microti-M. bovis in that they harbor the polymorphism motif exclusively in their
PE_PGRS17 gene sequence, (iv) for the remaining modern M. tuberculosis strains (259 PGG2 and 48 PGG3), the
largest number of strains harbor the polymorphism exclusively in their PE_PGRS17 gene sequence, while a smaller
proportion of PGG2 group (n = 112) and only 3 strains
from the PGG3 group contained the 12/40 polymorphism in both PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18 genes (+/+).
A very small number of isolates (n = 4 PGG2) were found
to mirror the reference strain M. tuberculosis H37Rv and its
derivative H37Ra in that the 12/40 polymorphism motif
was absent from both PE_PGRS genes (-/-; n = 6 in total).
This finding was confirmed by sequencing (data not
shown).
Overall, depending on the occurrence pattern of the 12/40
polymorphism (restricted to PE_PGRS17, shared by both
PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18, or absent from both paralogs), the whole MTBC complex falls into three PE_PGRSbased genotypic groups or PGRS types (termed PGRST1 to
3, respectively). Aside from representing all strains
(100%) of the M. africanum-M. microti-M. bovis lineage
and the M. tuberculosis PGG1 group, PGRST1 (+/-) is also
significantly the most predominant PGRS type within the
PGG2 (56%; P < 0.001) and PGG3 (87%; P = 0.0033)
groups. In contrast, PGRST2 (+/+) and PGRST3 (-/-) are
restricted to modern, non PGG1, M. tuberculosis strains.
The PGRST3 subpopulation is very rare, as in the whole
MTBC collection we could only identify 6 strains (1%),
which includes the laboratory strains H37Rv and H37Ra.
Importantly, PGRST2 was highly associated with PGG2
strains (P < 0.001) and could also be significantly found
in the PGG3 pool (P = 0.0004), albeit at a very low frequency (Figure 6A).
Frequency of the 3 new PE_PGRS-based genotypic groups
(PGRST) in three geographically distinct populations
As our collection contained a substantial number of

shown in Figure (6B, C and 6D), PGRST1 was predominant in the three geographic situations (P < 0.001; P <
0.001; and P = 0.0192, respectively).

Genetic variation of the PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18
genes
To obtain better insight into the evolution of these two
PE_PGRS paralogs, we analyzed the genetic variability of
the sequenced genes across the worldwide tubercle bacilli
collection. As mentioned earlier, the 12/40 polymorphism is highly conserved, as the same insertion and the
40 accompanying SNPs are observed for both genes irrespective of the MTBC subspecies. In no case, have we
noticed a missing SNP or a variation for the 12-nt insertion and its associated 40 SNPs. However, aside from the
12/40 polymorphism, we observed along the partial
sequence of both genes, a total of 30 MTBC-associated
polymorphic sites (14 sSNPs, 15 nsSNPs and a 114-nt in-

frame M. microti-specific deletion) (See Figure 7). Overall,
after concatenating the sequences of both PE_PGRS genes
and taking into account the 12/40 polymorphism, 26
MTBC alleles were identified (T1 to T26), of which 20
(77%) were associated with M. tuberculosis. In this species,
much of the genetic diversity was found to be associated
with PE_PGRS18, as assessed by the estimation of the π
value for both synonymous (πs) and nonsynonymous
(πa) substitutions. However, both genes appear to be
under purifying selection as their ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions per site (Ka/Ks) is <1
(Additional file 5). Unlike M. tuberculosis, the orthologs
from strains of the M. africanum-M. microti-M. bovis lineage appear more homogeneous; the strain collections of

on selected members of the M. tuberculosis complex and

and 18 correspond to PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18, respectively. MTBC strains producing a single reacting dot with
PE_PGRS 17 (presence of the 12/40 polymorphism in
PE_PGRS17 but not in PE_PGRS18) are referred to as "+/-"
and belong to the PGRS type 1 group (PGRST1). Isolates
whose PEGAssay pattern produces two reacting dots (presence of the 12/40 polymorphism in both PE_PGRS17 and
PE_PGRS18 genes) are referred to as "+/+" and belong to
the PGRS type 2 genotype (PGRST2). Finally, isolates whose
PEGAssay produces no hybridization signal (absence of the
12/40 polymorphism from both PE_PGRS genes) are
referred to as "-/-" and belong to the PGRS type 3 genotypic
group (PGRST3). Note that M. smegmatis strain mc2 155,
which lacks both PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18 whole genes,
produces no hybridization signal.

M. africanum and M. microti each defining a unique allele,
and sequences for 19 out of the 20 M. bovis strains (including M. bovis AF2122/97) were identical.
The sequences from the pre-bottleneck species, "M. canettii" and other smooth tubercle bacilli, were clearly the

most divergent. Indeed, aside from sharing 10 SNPs with
the other MTBC strains, they showed 25 additional specific polymorphic sites (15 sSNPs, 7 nsSNPs, 2 insertions,
and 1 deletion), clearly indicating their evolutionary distance from the rest of the MTBC. In both "M. canettii" and
the two other smooth tubercle bacilli strains, PE_PGRS18
is frame-shifted (a 1-nt insertion immediately after position 270) and this gene appears to be much more variable
than its paralog.
Further inspection of the nucleotide substitutions
revealed that nucleotide changes in both paralogs tend to
occur within the same nucleotide positions, irrespective of
the evolutionary status of the species. In fact, nucleotide
positions 54, 119, 129, 153, 213, 217, 247, 450, 462, 507,
508, and 510, showed variability in both PE_PGRS genes.
Thus, certain positions appear to be prone to genetic variation although evolving differently within different species. Strikingly, in all but one variable position (position
119), the mutations in one paralog are permuted comparatively to the other. Consequently, where the mutation is
non synonymous (nucleotide positions 129, 217, 247,
and 508) the phenotypic change for both paralogs is limited to two amino acids throughout all the species (Figure
7).
Because PE_PGRS genes are GC-rich sequences, we looked
at the occurrence of the mutation with respect to the
codon position. ANOVA and Tukey's tests (See Additional
file 6) showed that, for both genes, the third codon position significantly displayed the highest GC content (P <
0,001 for both genes). However, although mutations
occurred more frequently at the third codon position (P <
0.001 for both ANOVA and Tukey's test) in PE_PGRS18,
no such association could be observed for PE_PGRS17.
Thus, a mutational bias might have operated for the diversification of PE_PGRS18.

Discussion
Previous studies involving comparative genomics and
explorative genome-wide multilocus analysis conclusively
showed that the present MTBC strains appear as a genetically homogeneous clonal pool, since they display a
highly significant linkage disequilibrium and an exceptionally low rate of silent nucleotide substitutions
[4,7,33,35-37]. This picture contrasts with the situation
that seems to have prevailed in the very early history of the
tubercle bacillus in which a significant rate of DNA
exchanges were allowed, most likely through intragenomic recombination and horizontal gene transfer [19].
Compelling evidence suggest that members of the MTBC
arose from a single successful ancestor, resulting from a
recent evolutionary bottleneck [4,15,19]. The identity of
such a parental strain has not been defined, though some
genetic markers (polymorphisms located in codon 463 of

the katG gene and codon 95 of the gyrA sequence, an SNP
in the promoter region of the narGHJI gene complex, and
the TbD1 deletion) help to distinguish between ancestral
and modern MTBC strains [4,15,16,38].
The findings from this study provide additional evidence
for the concept that the present clonal MTBC strains are
the progeny of a single successful ancestor. Indeed, the
identified PE_PGRS-associated 12/40 polymorphism
could represent a genetic marker for the most successful
post-bottleneck-derived clone from which the MTBC
strains expanded. Based on this polymorphism, we
showed that all MTBC strains could be assigned to three
new PE_PGRS-based genotypic groups (PGRST1 to 3).
Strikingly, PGRST1 was found to be predominant in all
three katG-gyrA defined PGG groups irrespective of their
geographic origin and evolutionary status (ancestral or

modern). Because all ancestral (TbD1+) strains, including
the M. africanum-M. microti-M. bovis lineage, belong to
PGRST1, one can argue that acquisition of the 12/40 polymorphism is coincident with the emergence of the most
successful MTBC parental strain. Consistently, the 12/40
polymorphism was absent from both PE_PGRS genes in 6
"M. canettii" strains and one other smooth tubercle bacillus analyzed, which are believed to represent the very early
pre-bottleneck MTBC progenitors [19].
From the overall distribution pattern of the 12/40 polymorphism, a general evolutionary picture emerges (Figure
8) which conforms to, and confirms, previously published evolutionary scenarios for the tubercle bacillus
[4,15,16,19]. As PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18 showed the
highest degree of homology and represent a typical tandem duplicate, one can deduce the molecular events

which took place in the most ancestral tubercle bacillus
strain. Such a strain would be TbD1+ and harbor a single
copy of a gene genetically very close to PE_PGRS17 or
PE_PGRS18 (the PE_PGRS17/18 common ancestor).
After duplication of this ancestral gene copy, further gene
evolution led to the "M. canettii"-associated genetic configuration in which both genes lack the 12/40 polymorphism, but have separately undergone isolated single
nucleotide changes. During the adaptive period of the
progenitor species, additional genetic changes took place,
including the occurrence of the 12/40 polymorphism in
the one paralog (PE_PGRS17). The fact that the GC content of the 12/40 polymorphism is in the range of that of
the mycobacterial host genome, may have ensured its
maintenance throughout the clonal expansion of the
MTBC progenitor. The data suggest that the polymorphism has remained stable throughout the expansion into
the M. africanum-M. microti-M. bovis lineage and within
the ancestral M. tuberculosis strains, and only with the
emergence of modern TB has this variation been able to

be transmitted (in its entirety) into the other paralog or
deleted from PE_PGRS17. Such a genetic rearrangement
occurred exclusively in PGG2 and PGG3 groups leading to
the emergence of the two aforementioned disproportionately less frequent PGRST2 and PGRST3 subpopulations.
The emergence of these two newly defined modern subpopulations could be explained by the natural occurrence
of homologous recombination between the two PE_PGRS
gene sequences of strains from the PGRST1 population.
The sequence environment (close proximity and high
sequence identity) appears to be optimal for such a mechanism to take place, although it only seems to occur in the
modern M. tuberculosis strains. It has already been shown,
through in vitro experiments, that initiation of homologous recombination occurs in mycobacteria provided that
sequence heterology does not exceed 10–12% [39]. Such
a requirement is largely fulfilled in the case of PE_PGRS17
and PE_PGRS18, but may eventually restrict homologous
recombination events between other PE_PGRS paralogs

Page 10 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:107

that have undergone substantial levels of sequence divergence (up to 12%).
Transfer of the 12/40 polymorphism from the
PE_PGRS17 to its neighboring paralog, or its reversion
(loss from PE_PGRS17 sequence) in modern M. tuberculosis, is typical of a homologous recombination process
called "gene conversion". Such a gene replacement event
is frequently observed among members of multigene families in bacterial genomes and contributes to both the
maintenance of genetic information and creation of
genetic diversity [40]. It is very unlikely that horizontal
gene transfer (HGT) may have contributed to generate the
two modern PGRS types of populations (PGRST2 and
PGRST3). Indeed, random acquisition of the 12/40 polymorphism through HGT would have generated an additional PGRS type population, harboring the
polymorphism uniquely in its PE_PGRS18 sequence (a
putative "-/+" population).
The recent generation of PGRST2 and PGRST3 subpopulations from the predominant PGRST1 accommodates
either the double-strand break repair (DSBR) or the synthesis-dependent strand annealing models [41,42] as the
molecular basis for this gene conversion event. It seems
that the pre-synaptic double-strand breaks that initiate the
homologous recombination event in the PGRST1 population occurred more frequently in PE_PGRS18 than in
PE_PGRS17, so that PGRST2 emerges more frequently
than PGRST3. Under such circumstances, the DNA
polymerase will use the 12/40 polymorphism-containing
PE_PGRS17 sequence as homologous template to fill-in
the broken PE_PGRS18 gene sequence, resulting in the
PGRST2-associated genotype.
The distribution of the polymorphism types when
informed by PGG and sSNP clusters strongly indicates
that gene conversion events (followed by clonal expansion) occurred independently multiple times (Figure 9).
Indeed, all the PGG2 sSNP clusters each possess both
PGRST1 and PGRST2 despite existing over clearly divergent evolutionary tracts. Based upon the data set presented in Figure 9, conversion has occurred at least four
times and reversion at least once (or twice if one considers
the PGG2 PGRST3 strains not included in Figure 9). Overall, the results clearly indicate that PGRST2 and PGRST3
subpopulations are modern M. tuberculosis lineages and
emerged separately from PGRST1 strains through multiple gene conversion events. It is also interesting to note
that two of the 6 strains identified with PGRST3 were laboratory strains (H37Rv and H37Ra), which have undergone significant in vitro culturing over decades, so that this
conversion may not really occur or be tolerated well only
under in vivo infection conditions.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/107

RecA-mediated gene conversion processes have been
shown to occur in vitro between two rRNA operon copies
in M. smegmatis, uncovering the molecular mechanism
underlying resistance to aminoglycosides [43]. As far as
could be ascertained, this study provides the first concrete
example and the most direct evidence for the natural
occurrence of gene conversion events in mycobacteria.
However, Gutacker et al. [33] have previously suspected
recombination when addressing the distribution pattern
of 5 polymorphic nucleotides within the Rv0980cRv0981 intergenic region (Rv0980c-Rv0981 iSNPs). This
finding raises the question whether the complicated pattern of the Rv0980c-Rv0981 iSNPs would be linked to the
12/40 polymorphism-associated gene conversion event.
Indeed, if gene conversion extends to the homologous
intergenic sequences of PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18, the
distribution profile of the iSNPs must be identical for
both genes, as a result of gene replacement. The data
show, that for both H37Rv and CDC1551, whose
PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18 genes have undergone gene
conversion, the iSNPs distribution patterns of the two
genes are quite different. Thus, unless the 5 polymorphic
nucleotide positions are exceptionally unstable, the complicated pattern of this intergenic polymorphism does not
seem to be associated with the gene conversion event
described in the present paper.
It is well assumed that gene duplication and subsequent
functional divergence are crucial for bacterial evolution as
they play a major role in gene innovation and adaptation
to changing environments [32]. In this context, it is worth
mentioning that although PE_PGRS genes are restricted to
mycobacterial species, they have preferentially expanded
within the genomes of pathogenic mycobacteria, most
likely through extensive gene duplication events coupled
to genetic divergence during their adaptation to the very
hostile intra-macrophagic environment [24]. We hypothesize that gene conversion may have contributed to the
evolution of members of the PE_PGRS subfamily and may
have participated in the generation of antigenic variation
in their members [22,2,28]. It is striking that this type of
recombination does not seem to occur in the MTBC members other than modern M. tuberculosis, and one wonders
whether this is a mechanism that is specific to, or that may
occur at greater frequency in modern M. tuberculosis.
Recently, Lui et al. [44], extending Gutacker's analysis
[33], identified a mosaic polymorphic pattern (the
IRMT0105 locus) associated with a PPE gene (MT0105).
The authors hypothesize that small-scale gene conversion
or recombination at hotspots near PE or PPE gene families
has been an important mechanism for M. tuberculosis to
escape immune surveillance.
As far as could be ascertained, the functions(s) of
PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18 are unknown and, as yet,

Schematic representation of the proposed evolutionary history of the tubercle bacilli according to the presence and absence of
the 12/40 polymorphism. The scenario was constructed from the distribution of the 12/40 polymorphism within and between
species. This scenario fits in with previously-proposed evolutionary schemes based on deletion regions and single nucleotide
polymorphisms [15, 15, 19]
there is no indication whether they are essential or not.
According to the present study, it could be assumed that
both PE_PGRS genes may be dispensable for normal in
vivo growth under certain conditions as they are absent
from the genome of M. leprae, and PE_PGRS18 was frameshifted in the two "M. canettii" and two other smooth
tubercle bacilli strains analysed. By contrast, no such
frame shift mutations were observed in the worldwide
sequenced collection of MTBC strains, indicating that they
may have evolved to assume an essential role in these particular widespread species. Consistently, PE_PGRS17 and
PE_PGRS18 belong to the so-called iVEGI (in vivoexpressed genomic island), a cluster of 49 in vivoexpressed genes, thought to encode cell wall components
and participate in lipid metabolism required for mycobacterial survival in vivo [45]. Within this island, PE_PGRS17
and PE_PGRS18 account among the 21 genes that display
higher expression levels in mice samples compared to in
vitro cultures. The iVEGI locus harbors at least three genes
(Rv0981, Rv0986, and Rv0987), whose products were
shown to be required in early interactions with the host
cell as well as in persistence [46-48]. Furthermore, genes
playing critical roles in bacterial survival and fitness generally display higher acquisition rates for sSNP (Ks) in
comparison to nsSNP (Ka). We found that both
PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18 are under purifying selection as the majority of disadvantageous phenotypic
changes would have been eliminated during evolution.
We consistently found that, irrespective of the species,
only particular non-synonymous changes are tolerated
within certain nucleotide positions of both genes. These
findings, and the fact that these genes appear to be preferentially expressed in vivo [45], argue for a potential role in
host-pathogen interactions.

Finally, the question comes to mind whether the occurrence of the 12/40 polymorphism could have enabled
PE_PGRS17 to acquire a new or altered function that positively influenced the evolution of the MTBC. If so, it is
also interesting to speculate whether the recent change
from the PGRST1 to PGRST2 genotype in M. tuberculosis
would further increase its fitness and/or adaptability.
Indeed, as with PGG2 isolates, PGRST2 appears to be frequently associated with outbreak strains and clustered
cases, although not exclusively. By contrast, as mentioned
earlier, the PGRST3 genotype is very rare among TB cases,
and two of the four strains found to contain the genotype
are in fact laboratory strains (H37Rv and H37Ra), thus
seeming less prone to expansion and/or to have occurred
as a more recent reversion event. Although it is hard to
believe that a single polymorphism in one or two genes
would have dramatically impacted the evolution of the
tubercle mycobacterial species, further experiments based
on gene replacement and/or inactivation of the different
forms of both PE_PGRS genes are needed to clarify this
issue. It is worth mentioning that the 12/40 polymorphism lies within a region of the protein, which according
to the domain organization proposed by Brenan et al.
[25], may represent a transmembrane helix. This location
may be critical for the protein function inasmuch as PE/
PPE protein complexes are strongly suspected to be
involved in signal transduction [49].

Conclusion
Deciphering the evolution of bacterial populations is crucial to better understand the genetic traits behind the
emergence of biomedically relevant strains. In the present

Distribution of the three PGRS types through sSNP-based genetic clusters and PGG groups
Figure 9
Distribution of the three PGRS types through sSNP-based genetic clusters and PGG groups. The Phylogenetic tree of M. tuberculosis isolates from New York and New Jersey shows the relative distribution of PGRS types 1 (PGRST1; +/-), 2 (PGRST2; +/
+), and 3 (PGRST3; -/-) with respect to the synonymous single-nucleotide (sSNP)-defined 9 major genetic clusters (I, II, IIA, and
III to VIII) and PGG grouping. The 36 sSNP-based phylogenetic tree was constructed as described by Gutacker et al. [33]. The
data clearly indicate that the PE_PGRS17/PE_PGRS18-associated gene conversion event occurs multiple times mainly in PGG2
strains.

the tubercle mycobacterial species. This polymorphism
provides a valuable marker of the ill-defined successful
ancestor that emerged from the evolutionary bottleneck
and from which the MTBC expanded. The findings also
demonstrate the involvement of natural gene conversion
events specifically in the diversification of the modern M.
tuberculosis population. To our knowledge, this paper provides the first concrete example for the natural occurrence
of such a molecular event in mycobacteria.

Methods
Sequence data
The complete gene and protein sequences of all members
of the PE gene family in the genome of M. tuberculosis

H37Rv were obtained from the GenoList (Pasteur Institute) website [50]. The sequences from all PE members
which are contiguous in the genome were extracted from
these datasets for further characterization. The contiguous
PE sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW [51]. Amino
acid similarity and identity rates were calculated using
BioEdit [52] with an integrated Blosum62 matrix. Members that showed high percentages of identity were further
aligned to their corresponding orthologs from the
genome sequences of M. tuberculosis CDC1551 [53] and
M. bovis AF2122/97 [50]. The complete genome
sequences of M. marinum strain ATCC BAA-535 [54] and
M. microti strain OV254 [54] were obtained from the
Sanger Institute website.

Bacterial strains
A total of 521 mycobacterial isolates recovered from
diverse geographic origins (Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe,
and North- and South-America), were used in this study.
The collection was chosen to be representative of the
known diversity of the MTBC and the pre-bottleneck lineages. It included 415 M. tuberculosis strains (representing
members from all three Principal Genetic Groups (PGG)
as defined by Sreevatsan et al. [4], i.e. 108 PGG1, 259
PGG2 and, 48 PGG3 strains), 42 M. bovis strains (including 5 different BCG strains), 30 M. africanum strains representing members from all three subtypes defined by
Viana-Niero et al. [55] (i.e. 14 subtype A1, 6 subtype A2
and 8 subtype A3 strains), 17 M. microti strains (including
9 from voles, 3 from llama, 2 from cat, 1 from pig and 2
from humans), 3 dassie bacillus strains, 4 M. pinnipedii
strains, 2 M. caprae strains, 6 "M. canettii" strains and 2
smooth tubercle bacilli isolates (representing members
from five of the eight Smooth Tubercle Bacilli Groups- ST
groups-identified by Gutierrez et al. [19], ie.1 ST group A,
3 ST group C, 2 ST group D, and 1 each of ST group B and
I). The M. tuberculosis isolates, which were recovered from
at least 32 different countries, involved 57 ancestral
(TbD1+) [15], 31 Beijing, 91 Haarlem, 73 LAM, 85 T, 16
CAS, 17 X, 5 S, 10 U and 1 MANU families [56]. Details
on the geographic origin, host, spoligotype pattern, and
PGG of each isolate of the whole collection are available
in the Additional file 4.
PCR and DNA sequencing
PCR amplification of PE_PGRS17 (Rv0978c) and
PE_PGRS18 (Rv0980c) gene sequences was accomplished
using a common sense primer, 7880S (5'-ATGTCGTTTGTCAACGTGGC-3'; positions 1–20) and the specific reverse
oligonucleotides 0978R1 (5'-TCAGCTGATTACCGACACCGT-3',
976–996)
and
0980R1
(5'-TCATATGGCCGCCGAACACAC-3', 1354–1374), respectively. The
amplification reaction mixture contained 2 μl of template
genomic DNA (about 20 ng), 10 μl of 10× buffer (Qiagen), 10 μl DMSO, 2 μl of 10 mM nucleotide mix (Amersham Biosciences), 2 μl of each primer (20 μM stock),
0,25 μl (1.25 U) of HotStart Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen) and sterile nuclease-free water (Amersham Biosciences) to 100 μl total reaction volume. Cycling was
carried out in a PTC 9700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) with an initial denaturation step of 10 min at 96°C
followed by 35 cycles consisting of 1 min at 95°C, 1 min
at 60°C and 2 min at 72°C. The amplification ended with
a final elongation step of 7 min at 72°C. PCR products
were purified using the GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band purification kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. Partial DNA sequencing (nucleotides 31 to 712) was performed using the sense primers
7880S (see above) and PEGA.S (5'-CAAGCGATCAGCGCGCAGG-3', 184–202) for both genes. Sequenc-

ing on the reverse strand involved the internal primers
0978R2 (5'-CGCTTGGACCGTTGCCGATGG-3', 770–
790) and 0980R2 (5'-GAGGCTGACCGCGCCGCCGGT3', 730–750) for PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18, respectively. Determination of the nucleotide sequence was performed with the Prism Ready Reaction Dye Deoxy
Terminator Cycle sequencing Kit on an ABI PRISM 377
DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Each sample was
sequenced from two independent PCR amplification reactions.
Sequence analysis
The sequence data was edited and aligned using the software programs BioEdit [52] and ClustalW [51]. Both the
PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18 genes were either analysed
individually or upon concatenation. The software programs Arlequin v.2.0 [57] and DNASP [58] were used to
obtain summary statistics of genetic diversity. To test for
adaptive selection, we determined the nucleotide substitution changes and the ratio of synonymous (Ks) and
nonsynonymous (Ka) substitutions per site. For this purpose, we used the analysis developed by Nei-Gojobori
[59] as implemented in the DNASP package. A statistical
analysis of ANOVA and a Tukey's test were performed to
test for significant difference of GC content and substitution rates between PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18.
Set up of a reverse hybridization dot blot assay for rapid
PE_PGRS-based grouping (PEGAssay) of MTBC strains
Biotinylated PCR products encompassing the 12/40 polymorphism were obtained using the common sense primer
PEGA.S and the biotinylated member specific reverse
primers PEGA78.R (5'-bGACACCGTGCCGCTGCCGAAA3',
705–725)
and
PEGA80.R
(5'-bCCGTTGCCGAACAGCCATCC-3', 568–587) for PE_PGRS17 and
PE_PGRS18, respectively. The amplification conditions
were the same as mentioned above. Ten microliters of the
biotinylated and heat denatured PCR product (diluted to
a total volume of 150 μl with 2 × SSPE-0.1% SDS) was further hybridized with a 24-mer 5' amino-linked oligonucleotide probe (5'-GATCGAGCAGGCCCTGTTGGGGGT3'). The latter represents the 12-nucleotide insertion and
the immediate downstream 12 nucleotides of the 12/40
polymorphism and was synthesized according to the
PE_PGRS17 sequence of strain CDC1551. The probe was
diluted in 150 μl of 0.5 M NaHCO3 (final concentration
of 3 ng/μl) and covalently bound to a Biodyne C membrane (Pall Biosupport, Portsmouth, United Kingdom)
using standard protocols [60]. Briefly, after activation of
the membrane, 150 μl of the diluted probe was applied in
wells of a 96-well dot blot apparatus (BioRad) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Following inactivation and washing steps, biotinylated PCR products were
added to the wells and the entire apparatus was then incubated at stringent hybridization conditions (65°C for 1

h). The samples were removed by vacuum aspiration and
the membrane was washed three times with 50 ml of 2 ×
SSPE-0.5% SDS for 10 min at 57°C. After incubation for
45 min at 42°C with 10 U of streptavidin-POD (Amersham Biosciences) diluted in 20 ml of 2 × SSPE-0.5% SDS,
the membrane was washed twice with 50 ml of 2 × SSPE0.5% SDS for 10 min at 42°C and then once with 25 ml
of 2 × SSPE for 10 min at room temperature. ECL chemiluminescence detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences)
were added according to the manufacturer's instructions,
and the membrane was exposed to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences) for 5 min. To allow for repeated use
(up to 10 times), the membrane was stripped during a 1 h
incubation in 1% SDS at 90°C, after which it was incubated in 20 mM EDTA for 20 min at room temperature
and stored at 4°C.
Typing assays
Spoligotyping, assignment of isolates to PGG, and detection of the TbD1 region, were performed according to previously described protocols [60,4,15].
Statistical analysis
Associations were evaluated for statistical significance
using the χ2 or Fisher's Exact Test implemented in GrapPad Prism v.4. (GraphPad Software, Inc., USA). A P value
< 0.05 was considered to be significant.
