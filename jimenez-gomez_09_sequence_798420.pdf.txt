Abstract
Background: Tomato species are of significant agricultural and ecological interest, with cultivated
tomato being among the most common vegetable crops grown. Wild tomato species are native to
diverse habitats in South America and show great morphological and ecological diversity that has
proven useful in breeding programs. However, relatively little is known about nucleotide diversity
between tomato species. Until recently limited sequence information was available for tomato,
preventing genome-wide evolutionary analyses. Now, an extensive collection of tomato expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) is available at the SOL Genomics Network (SGN). This database holds
sequences from several species, annotated with quality values, assembled into unigenes, and tested
for homology against other genomes. Despite the importance of polymorphism detection for
breeding and natural variation studies, such analyses in tomato have mostly been restricted to
cultivated accessions. Importantly, previous polymorphisms surveys mostly ignored the linked
meta-information, limiting functional and evolutionary analyses. The current data in SGN is thus an
under-exploited resource. Here we describe a cross-species analysis taking full-advantage of
available information.
Results: We mined 20,000 interspecific polymorphisms between Solanum lycopersicum and S.
habrochaites or S. pennellii and 28,800 intraspecific polymorphisms within S. lycopersicum. Using the
available meta-information we classified genes into functional categories and obtained estimations
of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) quality, position in the gene, and effect on the encoded
proteins, allowing us to perform evolutionary analyses. Finally, we developed a set of more than
10,000 between-species molecular markers optimized by sequence quality and predicted intron
position. Experimental validation of 491 of these molecular markers resulted in confirmation of 413
polymorphisms.
Conclusion: We present a new analysis of the extensive tomato EST sequences available that
represents the most comprehensive survey of sequence diversity across Solanum species to date.
These SNPs, plus thousands of molecular makers designed to detect the polymorphisms are
available to the community via a website. Evolutionary analyses on these polymorphism uncovered
sets of genes potentially important for the evolution and domestication of tomato; interestingly
these sets were enriched for genes involved in response to the environment.

Background
Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is the second most popular vegetable crop in the world [1]. In addition, tomato is
being developed as a model organism and is more closely
related to important crops like lettuce and coffee than
other models such as Arabidopsis, poplar or rice [2].
Tomato also has an interesting natural history, which
includes a single domesticated species and a number of
wild relatives that have wide morphological variability
and are adapted to very diverse environments [3,4]. The
comparative study of tomato wild species can help us
identify key genetic factors involved in domestication and
will benefit breeding programs.
Despite the advent of high throughput genomic techniques and bioinformatics, comprehensive genome-wide
information remains unavailable for most species, including tomato. Since the tomato genome sequence is currently incomplete and the microarray platforms for this
species do not feature most of the loci predicted to exist
[5-7], genetic studies have focused on the analysis of particular loci and segregating populations. These studies led
to in-depth information on a few loci and uncovered the
potential usefulness of the natural variation existing in
related species [3,4]. A major goal for tomato geneticists is
the acquisition of comprehensive genome-wide information that can be used in the improvement of resistance,
quality, aspect, flavor and growth in cultivated varieties
[8].
A large amount of genetic and molecular information is
available for tomato, most of which has been deposited at
the SGN http://sgn.cornell.edu. In this database there are
more than 320,000 ESTs from several tomato species. This
abundant sequence repository has been used to develop
polymerase chain reaction-based (PCR-based) molecular
markers to build on the original, time consuming and cost
ineffective restriction fragment length polymorphisms
(RFLPs) [9-12]
Recently, bioinformatic surveys of genome sequences
have revealed the importance of SNPs in shaping evolution and also in serving as molecular markers [13]. In
tomato, initial genomic work on SNP discovery involved
de novo sequencing of EST libraries and comparison to
the existing databases [14], or faster and less expensive
computer-aided mining of the available sequences
[15,16]. In these analyses only the information from the
plain sequence was used. As a consequence there were
high numbers of both false positives created by sequencing errors, and false negatives resulting from data that did
not meet the conditions set by the researchers, such as
minimum number of sequences or sequence similarity
surrounding a SNP. Furthermore, low rates of validation
were often obtained, in part because of lack of information on sequence quality and on intron position. For

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/85

example, if a predicted marker spans an intron it will be
difficult to detect by PCR.
There is now an increasing wealth of resources in the
tomato databases and similar repositories such as
sequence qualities, unigene assemblies, open reading
frame (ORF) predictions, sequence similarity with other
plant species and localization to genetic maps [17]. The
use of this metadata allows for more sophisticated experimental designs that increase the quality of SNP prediction
and information on the SNP's effects. For example, by
comparing tomato and Arabidopsis thaliana databases a set
of markers was developed that targeted loci conserved
throughout evolution both in sequence and copy number
[18,19]. This Conserved Orthologous Set (COS) has been
proven an invaluable resource for comparative and evolutionary studies among plants [20-22]. Similarly, a recent
publication used intron positions conserved between
tomato and Arabidopsis thaliana to detect intraspecific
SNPs in noncoding regions, demonstrating the possibilities of bioinformatics predictions [23].
Despite the availability of sequence-associated metadata
and the need for functional genomic studies in tomato,
there is surprisingly little information about the relevance
and levels of variation found in coding regions. Previous
SNP mining efforts are either based on noncoding regions
or have no information about the effect of the polymorphisms on protein sequence. Moreover, most SNPs mined
from EST sequences have little probability of being functionally important, since the majority are expected to fall
in the un-translated regions (UTR), where the polymorphism rate increases more than five fold in comparison
with coding regions, [23]. Information about the number,
localization and type of non-synonymous polymorphisms will help unravel useful information about the
evolution of genes that may have adaptive significance
[24], serving as a primer for more profound studies on
natural variation of interesting traits.
To perform reliable evolutionary and phylogenetic analyses sufficient polymorphism data can be obtained from
the sequences of the wild species already available. However, most studies have focused on finding intraspecific
molecular markers between cultivated tomato cultivars.
The few attempts to infer rates of polymorphism and
selection on tomato genes among its wild relatives are
reduced to small sets of genes likely providing biased estimations [25].
To fill the gap in knowledge about sequence similarities
and differences among cultivated and wild tomato species, we mined the EST and unigene tomato database from
SGN in search for substitutions and insertions/deletions
between and within the three species with highest representation: S. lycopersicum, S. habrochaites and S. pennellii.

We used additional metadata from the database to effectively predict SNPs and infer levels of polymorphism in
coding versus noncoding regions and in gene families. We
surveyed this dataset for signatures of sequence evolution,
selection and/or adaptation using the McDonald-Kreitman test [26] and codon-based maximum likelihood
analyses [27,28]. Based on the polymorphisms detected
we also developed a set of specific molecular markers and
a website to make these available to the community at
http://www.plb.ucdavis.edu/labs/maloof/TomatoSNP/
index.html.

Results and discussion
EST assembly
The unigene database version 200607 build 1 from SGN
consists of 239,172 ESTs grouped into 34,829 unigenes,
each one containing between 1 and 1087 ESTs, with an
average of 6.9 ESTs per unigene (data not shown). Unigenes can be formed by EST sequences from any tomato
race or species, although most unigenes (87%) contain
sequences from a single species (Figure 1).

We mined sequence assemblies of S. lycopersicum (L) ESTs
for intraspecific polymorphisms and assemblies containing sequences from both S. lycopersicum and S. habrochaites
(LxH) or S. lycopersicum and S. pennellii (LxP) for interspecific SNPs. To reduce the complexity of each analysis we
reassembled the unigenes using only ESTs from the species relevant to the analysis. The consensus sequence for
each reassembled contig was then aligned to the original
unigene sequence and, when available (88.89% of the
unigenes, data not shown), to the predicted coding
sequence (CDS). In the cases where a predicted CDS was
available, each nucleotide in the assembly was annotated
as 5' UTR, CDS or 3' UTR. We assigned quality scores to
each position in the assemblies by calculating separately
for each species the sum of the qualities of all nucleotides
at that particular position.
Several filters were applied to diminish the number of
false positive SNPs predicted in our analyses. Assembly
regions that did not align with unigene sequences were
removed. We also discarded positions where only a single
sequence was found and, in the interspecific analyses,
assembly regions where sequences from only one of the
species assayed were detected. Using the remaining portions of the assemblies we determined an optimum quality threshold for each analysis at which the average
sequence quality was maximized (see Methods, Figure 2).
Assembly positions that did not pass the quality threshold
were removed, leaving for SNP mining a total of 4,712
unigenes spanning 1,736 Kb of interspecific assemblies
and 19,159 unigenes including 11,058 Kb of intraspecific
S. lycopersicum data (Table 1).

In every analysis the majority of nucleotides assembled
were located in predicted coding regions. Between 2.8 and
6.2% of the positions could not be assigned to a gene
region due to the lack of predicted CDS (Table 1). The
average quality of the nucleotides considered in the
assemblies was always highest in the 5' regions and lowest
in the 3' regions (Figure 3). This could be explained by the
bias towards sequencing the ESTs from the 5', as an average of 95.87% of the sequences from each library were
readings from the top strand (data not shown). Interestingly, assemblies from unigenes for which there is no predicted CDS had overall average qualities similar to the 5'
region (Figure 3). This raises the possibility that those unigenes contain mostly 5' UTR sequence, in turn explaining
why ESTscan [29,30] was not able to predict a CDS.
SNP mining
We mined the resulting sequence assemblies for nonconsecutive SNPs taking into account the position of the SNP

SNP. In translated regions the majority of the mutations
are located in the third position of the codon (Figure 4).
This result was expected since selective pressure in coding
regions reduces the number of non-synonymous substitutions and the redundancy of the genetic code is mainly in
the third base of the codons. We then calculated hypothetical codons in the UTRs by extending the ORF from the
origin of transcription in the predicted CDS. The third
position bias disappeared in these hypothetical noncoding regions (Figure 4) suggesting that on average the SNP,
CDS, and codon position predictions are accurate. In
addition, when looking at all SNPs in coding regions

with respect to the predicted gene regions. In total 40,834
substitutions and 8,266 insertions/deletions (indels) were
detected (summarized in Table 1; see Additional files 1, 2,
3 &4 for full data). Several observations confirm the performance of our SNP detection algorithms. As shown in
Table 1, indels appear between 2.6 and 8.7 times more frequently in UTRs than in the CDS. Insertion and deletion
of nucleotides are likely to produce changes in the open
reading frames disrupting correct translation, therefore
selection against them is expected in coding regions. Similarly, predicted noncoding regions yielded between 1.8
and 2.9 times more SNPs per kilobase analyzed than coding regions (Table 1), as reported in previous tomato analyses [15,19,23,25]. We next used the estimated CDS for
each unigene to calculate the codon position for each

together, the percentage of non-synonymous SNPs is
46.37%, similar to genome-wide analyses in Arabidopsis
(45.34%) [31] and humans (46.46%) [32].
Regarding the differences between intra and interspecific
analyses, we found only 26.5% of the analyzed loci to be
polymorphic when mining a single species versus the
69.5% when analyzing pairs (Table 1). For interspecific
analysis the SNP rates were comparable to those published before between S. pennellii and S. lycopersicum
(1.02 to 1.61 SNPs/100 bp) making no distinction
between coding and non coding regions [14,33]. The
same holds true for S. lycopersicum intraspecific analyses,
where reported SNP rates range between 0.0117 and
0.585 SNPs/100 bp on all EST sequences analyzed regardless of their location in the gene [14-16,25].
SNP representation in Gene Ontology classes
We reasoned that certain gene families might be more variable among tomato cultivars and species than others. For
example, since tomato species are adapted to diverse environments, genes involved in environmental response
might accumulate a higher number of non-synonymous
SNPs due to selection. We used Gene Ontology (GO) categories [34], which group genes into functionally related
classes, to assess the differential polymorphic rates of unigenes encoding specific classes of proteins. We assigned
GO categories to each nucleotide position in the assemblies based on the closest Arabidopsis thaliana homolog,

and looked for categories with over- or under-representation of non-synonymous SNPs. To achieve higher power
we grouped together the data from the interspecific analyses. The larger number of sequences available in the
intraspecific analysis allowed greater statistical power,
although the most over- and underrepresented gene
classes are in agreement in both analyses (Figure 5). As
expected, GO categories related to environment interaction, such as responses to stress and abiotic stimulus, had
an over-representation of non-synonymous polymorphisms both between and within species (p < 0.001, Figure 5). On the other hand, categories involved in basic
biological processes and transcription regulation showed
a relative lack of polymorphisms, as had been found in
Arabidopsis thaliana accessions [31]. Surprisingly, genes
encoding ribosomal proteins also presented more SNPs
that expected, perhaps due to the challenge of distinguishing homologs from paralogs in this gene family, which
shows complex patterns of copy number variants in Arabidopsis [35].
McDonald-Kreitman test
The neutral evolution theory holds that most within species polymorphisms and between species differences have
little fitness consequence [36]. As a result, the ratio of
non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions should be
similar for a particular gene both within and between species. Deviations from this can be a sign of non-neutral
evolution [26]. To examine this prediction, we conPage 5 of 11

Polymorphism occurrence by Gene Ontology categories

structed alignments of the wild and cultivated consensus
sequences containing only the good quality positions and
the SNPs predicted by our algorithms, and surveyed each
alignment for signatures of positive selection using the
McDonald-Kreitman test [26]. With this method we tested
1425 unigenes from the S. lycopersicum and S. habrochaites
analysis and 924 unigenes from the S. lycopersicum and S.
pennellii analysis. Before correction for multiple testing we
found significant excess of non-synonymous mutations
(p < 0.05) in 16 unigenes in the LxH analysis and 3 unigenes in the LxP analysis (data not shown). However,
none of those unigenes survived the Benjamini and Hochberg correction for multiple testing [37].
Maximum likelihood codon-substitution models
The McDonald-Kreitman test compares variation between
and within two species. An alternative approach is to
simultaneously analyze all the sequences in a phylogenetic tree [38]. Following this method, we surveyed the
unigenes for signals of positive selection using maximum

likelihood estimates from codon-substitution models
[27,28]. We reasoned that genes important for domestication might show a higher rate of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions specifically in the S. lycopersicum
lineage. To test this idea, we fit two different models for
each unigene using alignments of the coding regions from
cultivated tomato, Arabidopsis thaliana and S. habrochaites
or S. pennellii. One of the models used assumed similar
non-synonymous/synonymous rates (dn/ds) in every
branch of the evolutionary tree (one-branch rate model).
The second model allowed for different dn/ds estimates in
the branch leading to S. lycopersicum relative to the rest of
the tree (two-branch rates model). For each gene we used
a likelihood ratio test to ask if the two-branch model fit
significantly better than the one-branch model. Support
for two-branch rates is suggestive of directional selection
on the branch leading to domesticated tomato, therefore
raising the possibility of identifying genes important for
domestication [38]. Alternatively, S. lycopersicum-specific
dn/ds ratios could occur due to natural selection acting

after the S. lycopersicum lineage split from S. pennellii or S.
habrochaites but before domestication. We were able to
test 1682 unigenes from the S. lycopersicum and S. habrochaites analysis and 1384 unigenes from the S. lycopersicum
and S. pennellii analysis. From those, 9 and 1 unigenes
respectively presented evidence of elevated non-synonymous substitution rates on the branch leading to S. lycopersicum after correction for multiple testing (Table 2),
suggesting these genes as possible targets of selection during domestication. We cannot discard, however, the possibility that some or all of these genes have an excess of
fixed polymorphisms in the cultivated tomato lineage due
to a population bottleneck during domestication [39], or
because of the effect of natural selection due to differing
environments. Among these genes we found that the three
GO categories most represented were responses to abiotic
and biotic stimulus, responses to stress and protein
metabolism. This finding is in concordance with our analysis of SNP over-representation in gene families.
Molecular marker design
Using the information gathered from the assemblies we
developed a set of molecular markers for detecting the
predicted SNPs. Successful design of PCR based molecular
markers from EST sequences requires the ability to avoid
amplifying introns. Since many Arabidopsis intron positions are conserved in tomato [23], we used this information (see Methods) to inform the design of molecular
markers for the polymorphisms identified in the interspecific analyses. First, we tested our intron predictions by
designing three primer pairs surrounding predicted
introns. One of those produced a band 700 bp greater
than expected without introns and the other two did not
amplify, suggesting the existence of introns where predicted (data not shown). We did not carry out similar
analysis for the intraspecific SNPs due to the lack of infor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/85

mation within SGN regarding the S. lycopersicum accessions used. Although it is well known that S. lycopersicum
ESTs in SGN come from several cultivars, the information
for each individual EST library is not available. For each
high-quality, interspecific SNP we developed a database
containing suggested primers to amplify the SNP region,
restriction enzymes to detect the polymorphism, and predicted fragment sizes before and after digestion of each
allele. This information can be accessed at http://
www.plb.ucdavis.edu/labs/maloof/TomatoSNP/
index.html.
We validated a subset of markers by using 491 primer
pairs designed to amplify fragments from S. lycopersicum
and from S. pennellii, S. habrochaites, or both. We calculated the size differences between the amplified products
cut with the appropriate restriction enzymes when needed
or uncut in the case of indels. From the 491 primer pairs,
6 pairs amplified fragments that were smaller than
expected and were discarded. Another 48 pairs failed to
amplify fragments in at least one species, leaving us with
437 primer pairs that would test 281 polymorphisms
between S. lycopersicum and S. habrochaites and 228 polymorphisms between S. lycopersicum and S. pennellii.
Among these, 30 primers pairs yielded bands that were
bigger than expected, probably due to the existence of
non-conserved introns, nevertheless 23 of these were polymorphic as expected after restriction enzyme digestion.
For the remaining amplifications we found 87% (220 of
261 LxH and 193 of 210 LxP) of the molecular markers to
work as predicted. It is worth noting that 10% of the successful markers showed bands corresponding to both alleles in at least one of the species tested, suggesting
heterozygosity in the lines used or the amplification of
fragments from a family of genes sharing that sequence.
Markers that failed could be due to undetected SNPs in

(LxP) ESTs. Intraspecific analysis of S. pennellii and S. habrochaites ESTs were not performed as the EST libraries for
those species were developed from a single accession.

Conclusion

For each unigene we used cap3 with relaxed parameters (p 66 -b 99 -e 200) to assemble the EST sequences from the
species participating in each of the analyses into analysisspecific contigs. Using these assemblies we calculated the
sum and average of the qualities for each nucleotide call
at every position and obtained analysis-specific consensus
sequences. These consensus sequences were aligned to the
original unigene sequence and the predicted CDS to estimate the beginning and end of the coding region. Every
step in this process was carried out and verified using custom Perl scripts.

We report in this work more than forty-nine thousand
inter and intraspecific polymorphisms mined from the
EST databases of the cultivated and two wild species of
tomato. By taking advantage of the additional information linked to each sequence we were able to more accurately estimate the quality and the position of each SNP
with respect to the coding region, which allowed us to distinguish those polymorphisms more likely to have phenotypic effects. Comparison of the sequences to homologs
from better characterized species also allowed us to functionally classify the predicted unigenes and perform gene
evolution analysis and tests for positive selection. We
were able to suggest candidate genes and gene families
that may be related to domestication of the cultivated
tomato and/or environmental adaptation of wild species,
providing hypotheses for more involved evolutionary
studies. The information obtained was also used to design
a set of markers that we make available to the community
via a website. To our knowledge this is the first time that
substantial meta-information including quality values,
open reading frame predictions and homology to genes in
Arabidopsis thaliana, has been used on tomato sequences
to perform a pre-genomic analysis of gene variability and
evolution.

Methods
Sequence data
Fasta files containing version 200607 build 1 of the unigene sequences, EST sequences, EST qualities and estimated coding region for each unigene were downloaded
from SGN. ESTs in this database originated from the
sequencing of at least 43 S. lycopersicum cDNA libraries
belonging to at least two different accessions, 2 S. pennellii
and 2 S. habrochaites cDNA libraries plus some individual
cDNAs. Unigenes are the consensus sequences of these
ESTs assembled with cap3 software as described in [17].
CDSs for the unigenes were calculated by SGN with ESTscan software [29,30]. This software returns an optimum
open reading frame based on Markov models and the
nucleotide usage found in coding regions. Lukas Mueller
at SGN kindly generated a custom list of all the unigenes
and their constituent ESTs. The highest BLAST hit of every
unigene versus the Arabidopsis thaliana genome was bulk
queried and downloaded from SGN. Arabidopsis thaliana
sequences were downloaded from TAIR (version
20080412, http://www.arabidopsis.org)
Assembly construction
We mined intraspecific SNPs in S. lycopersicum (L) ESTs
and interspecific SNPs between S. lycopersicum and S. habrochaites (LxH) and between S. lycopersicum and S. pennellii

Perl and R [40] scripts were developed to estimate the
quality score thresholds for sequence inclusion in SNP
discovery. Once a threshold was determined we exclusively considered the positions in the assemblies above
the threshold as follows. For interspecific analyses we
required the sum of all the qualities of the nucleotides
from each species to be over the threshold. For the
intraspecific analysis we developed an algorithm that partitions all qualities at a given position into two groups
with the minimum difference of the sums. We then considered only those positions in the assemblies at which
the sum of the qualities of both groups was over the
threshold. The threshold was defined as the quality score
that maximizes the average sequence quality calculated
separately for each species (interspecific analyses), or for
each group of qualities (intraspecific analysis) taking into
account only those positions over the threshold (Figure
2). We determined a quality threshold score of 50 for the
intraspecific S. lycopersicum analysis and of 40 for both
interspecific analyses (Figure 2).
SNP discovery
We defined SNPs in the intraspecific analysis as any
assembly position where two and only two different bases
were registered and for which the sum of qualities for each
nucleotide call was over the quality threshold imposed for
the analysis. For the interspecific analysis we considered
SNPs whose positions within the assemblies presented a
single and different nucleotide call for each species, and
whose sum of qualities was greater than the imposed
quality threshold. For quantification, SNPs that were consecutive in the assemblies were counted as a single polymorphisms. SNP rates were calculated as the number of
non-contiguous SNPs per 100 bases.

Amino acid translation, SNP codon position and transitions/transversion ratios were evaluated with custom Perl
and R scripts that analyzed the EST assemblies, the unigene sequence and the predicted CDS sequences.

Differential representation of SNPs in GO terms
Each nucleotide in the EST assemblies was assigned one or
more GO categories based on the terms from the homologous Arabidopsis thaliana locus. To increase the accuracy
of the test, we used only the parts of the assemblies that
corresponded to coding regions and only those SNPs that
has been predicted to produce amino acid changes. GO
categories text files (version 20080712) were downloaded
from TAIR [34]. For the interspecific analyses, we pooled
the nucleotide calls for both (LxH and LxP) analyses. For
duplicate loci we removed the locus with the shortest
sequence. R scripts were developed to calculate over and
under-representation of SNPs in nucleotide pools of each
GO category versus all SNPs/nucleotides detected in the
analysis using Fisher's exact test.
Tests for selection
We performed McDonald-Kreitman tests and estimated
Maximum likelihood from codon-substitution models on
those unigenes that contained S. lycopersicum together
with S. pennellii or S. habrochaites sequences. For the
McDonald-Kreitman test we built fasta files for each unigene with the estimated CDS for the wild species alleles
and two S. lycopersicum alleles differing in the SNPs identified in the L analysis. To maintain the fidelity of the analysis, those positions that did not pass the quality
threshold using the methods described above were substituted with the 'unknown' character and not considered in
the subsequent analysis. The number of synonymous and
non-synonymous substitutions and p-values were calculated using the previously described MK.pl Perl script [41].

berg algorithm in the Bioconductor multtest package
[37,45].
Molecular marker design
For each polymorphic unigene in the interspecific analysis
we aligned its predicted protein sequence with the protein
sequence of its Arabidopsis best BLAST hit using standalone BLAST and custom Perl scripts. We calculated
intron positions in the unigene based on intron positions
in the Arabidopsis CDS. For each SNP we designed primers using Primer3 [46] with the unigene sequences as
input, adjusting the program to design the primers within
the predicted exon where the SNP was located.

We used Bioperl to generate virtual PCR fragments for
each SNP allele based on the primers designed, and to
find restriction endonucleases that would differentially
cut the fragments, thus creating molecular markers. A set
of these molecular markers was tested on genomic DNA
from S. lycopersicum VF36, S. pennellii LA716 and S. habrochaites LA1347. Touchdown PCR was performed in a MJ
Research PTC-200 Thermocycler with a starting annealing
temperature of 58°C, which decreased 0.5°C per cycle for
15 cycles and stayed constant at 55°C for 30 cycles. Extension time was 40 seconds and denaturizing steps were performed for 30 seconds at 96°C. PCR products were
digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes to
detect the polymorphisms. We developed a database and
a website holding the molecular marker information for
each interspecific SNP.
All R and Perl scripts are available by request.

Two maximum likelihood codon-substitution models
were fit to test the hypothesis of existence of positive selection in each unigene [27,28]. First, we fit the null model
with a single dn/ds ratio with equal ratios in every branch.
The second model allowed for two dn/ds ratios: one for the
S. lycopersicum lineage and one for the rest of the tree.
Then, a likelihood ratio test of the hypothesis of two
branch rates was calculated by comparing the likelihood
values from both models as in [42]. To do this we created
Perl scripts that used ClustalW [43] to align the cultivated
and wild species predicted CDS and the homologous Arabidopsis thaliana coding sequences. Alignments whose sum
of qualities were not over the imposed quality threshold
were substituted with the 'unknown' character. We also
removed the parts of the alignments that lacked sequences
from any of the three species. We constructed a phylogenetic tree of the three species and used PAML (v 3.14 [44])
to calculate the maximum likelihood of the models.
The resulting p-values from these experiments were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini and Hoch-
