Abstract
Background: Analysis of complete microbial genomes showed that intracellular parasites and
other microorganisms that inhabit stable ecological niches encode relatively primitive signaling
systems, whereas environmental microorganisms typically have sophisticated systems of
environmental sensing and signal transduction.
Results: This paper presents results of a comprehensive census of signal transduction proteins –
histidine kinases, methyl-accepting chemotaxis receptors, Ser/Thr/Tyr protein kinases, adenylate
and diguanylate cyclases and c-di-GMP phosphodiesterases – encoded in 167 bacterial and archaeal
genomes, sequenced by the end of 2004. The data have been manually checked to avoid falsenegative and false-positive hits that commonly arise during large-scale automated analyses and
compared against other available resources. The census data show uneven distribution of most
signaling proteins among bacterial and archaeal phyla. The total number of signal transduction
proteins grows approximately as a square of genome size. While histidine kinases are found in
representatives of all phyla and are distributed according to the power law, other signal transducers
are abundant in certain phylogenetic groups but virtually absent in others.
Conclusion: The complexity of signaling systems differs even among closely related organisms.
Still, it usually can be correlated with the phylogenetic position of the organism, its lifestyle, and
typical environmental challenges it encounters. The number of encoded signal transducers (or their
fraction in the total protein set) can be used as a measure of the organism's ability to adapt to
diverse conditions, the 'bacterial IQ', while the ratio of transmembrane receptors to intracellular
sensors can be used to define whether the organism is an 'extrovert', actively sensing the
environmental parameters, or an 'introvert', more concerned about its internal homeostasis. Some
of the microorganisms with the highest IQ, including the current leader Wolinella succinogenes, are
found among the poorly studied beta-, delta- and epsilon-proteobacteria. Among all bacterial phyla,
only cyanobacteria appear to be true introverts, probably due to their capacity to conduct oxygenic
photosynthesis, using a complex system of intracellular membranes. The census data, available at
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Complete_Genomes/SignalCensus.html, can be used to get an insight
into metabolic and behavioral propensities of each given organism and improve prediction of the
organism's properties based solely on its genome sequence.

Background
All living organisms adjust their metabolism and behavior
in response to the changes in their environment. For unicellular microorganisms, knowing themselves, i.e. constantly monitoring a variety of environmental and
intracellular parameters, is a necessary condition of survival. Mechanisms of some adjustments can be as simple
as those in the lac operon – the presence of a substrate
induces expression of the genes that are necessary for
assimilation of that substrate (although even lac operon
has a complex high-level regulation through catabolite
repression and inducer exclusion, see [1] and references
therein). More complex regulatory mechanisms include
transmission of an external signal across the cytoplasmic
membrane, followed by intracellular signal transduction
to the appropriate genes (operons), metabolic enzymes,
or to such organelles as bacterial flagella. Given that all
these mechanisms have to be encoded in the organism's
genome, the complexity of the signaling systems correlates with the genome size and the range of environmental
challenges it normally encounters. Bacterial parasites that
inhabit relatively stable host environments typically
encode few, if any, signaling proteins (see [2-4]).
Analysis of the first three sequenced microbial genomes
revealed very few signaling systems: four histidine kinases
(HKs), five response regulators (RRs) and no methylaccepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) in Haemophilus
influenzae, none of these in Mycoplasma genitalium or Methanococcus (recently renamed Methanocaldococcus) jannaschii. Analysis of the fourth sequenced organism, the
freshwater cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803,
revealed 42 HKs and 38 RRs [5], whereas the fifth, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, again had none. The list of signaling
proteins encoded in microbial genomes grew by leaps and
bounds ever since, generally following the exponential
increase in the number of completely sequenced genomes
and the total number of proteins that they encode (Figure
1). Given the importance of two-component signal transduction in bacteria [6,7], the numbers of HKs and RRs
were routinely reported in many genome descriptions.
However, due to the limitations of employed algorithms
and arbitrarily high cut-off values in most sequence comparison protocols, certain HK variants were often missed,
for example, the HKs of the LytS family (family HPK8 in
the classification of Grebe and Stock [8,9]). Some HKs of
the recently described HWE family [10] have not been recognized as HKs even when compared against SMART
[11,12] and Pfam [13,14] domain databases [15]. Because
of that, HKs were systematically undercounted: the
number of HKs in E. coli, first reported to be 28 [16], was
then revised upwards to 29 [2,17] and now stands at 30
[18]; [see Additional file 1]). Likewise, the number of HKs
encoded by Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, originally estimated to be 42 [5], has been revised to 46 [2]. As a result,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/35

most estimates of the HK numbers published in previous
years are unreliable. Besides, listings of signal transduction proteins typically did not take into account Ser/Thr/
Tyr-specific protein kinases (STYKs) and protein phosphatases, which, as we now know, were encoded in the H.
influenzae, M. genitalium, and M. jannaschii genomes [see
Additional file 1], see [19,20]. Further, cross-genome
comparisons revealed entirely new classes of signaling
molecules with GGDEF and EAL domains, involved in the
turnover of the c-di-GMP, a novel secondary messenger
[21,22]. Although genetic data and sequence considerations have long pointed to the diguanylate cyclase (c-diGMP synthetase) activity of the GGDEF domain and the
phosphodiesterase (c-di-GMP hydrolase) activity of the
EAL domain, direct biochemical proof that this is indeed
the case has became available only in the past year [2325], reviewed in [21,22]. Predicted phosphodiesterase
activity of the HD-GYP domain [26] has never been experimentally verified. Finally, although participation of cellular adenylate cyclases (ACs) in signal transduction was
never in question, class 3 enzymes (AC3s) were recognized as legitimate environmental sensors only last year,
when they were shown to function as light receptors modulating motility in cyanobacteria [27,28]. Adenylate cyclases of class 1 and class 2, represented by experimentally
characterized proteins from E. coli (AC1, [29]) and Aeromonas hydrophila (AC2, [30]), are cytoplasmic enzymes of
relatively narrow phylogenetic distribution [see Additional file 1] and are not known to function as environmental sensors.
The diversity of the signal transduction systems made
careful accounting for all of them a daunting task, further
complicated by the paucity of the data on the cellular targets for STYKs [31] and virtual absence of any data on the
mechanisms of c-di-GMP-mediated regulation [21,22].
Hence, most signaling protein surveys focused exclusively
on certain classes of membrane receptors (HKs and/or
MCPs) and RRs [5,16,17,32-34], or on certain organisms,
mostly cyanobacteria and actinobacteria [35-38]. Shi,
Kennelly and Potts performed a comprehensive survey of
STYKs and protein phosphatases [19,20,39], but have not
looked at other signaling proteins. Galperin and colleagues [2,26] performed a census of HKs, GGDEF, and
EAL domains but never considered STYKs or ACs. Surveys
of the MCP and AC3 distribution in complete microbial
genomes by Zhulin [40] and Shenoy and Visweswariah
[41], respectively, were limited to these protein domains.
The information on signaling systems is poorly represented in public databases. While HKs and RRs are covered in the KEGG database [42,43], other signaling
systems are not. The SENTRA [44,45]), SMART [11,12]
and COG [46,47] databases have a good coverage of the
first sequenced genomes but have not been updated in a
while, whereas data in other databases, such as Pfam

[13,14] or PEDANT [48,49] are generated mostly by automatic means and therefore prone to the biases described
above (and also in the Results section).
While preparing recent reviews on signal transduction in
bacteria [3,22], the need for comprehensive and reliable
data on the distribution of specific signaling systems
among different phylogenetic lineages became all too
obvious. Since signal transduction systems grow in
number and complexity with the genome size and play
increasingly important roles in environmental bacteria
[3,4], it has become clear that comparative analysis of
such systems could provide a useful insight into bacterial
behavior [50]. Here I present a comprehensive census of
HKs, MCPs, STYKs and ACs, as well as GGDEF, EAL, and
HD-GYP domains encoded in complete genomes of 167
bacterial and archaeal species, sequenced by the end of
2004. I hope that availability of these data on a public
web site [51], which will be updated as needed, will stimulate further analysis of microbial signal transduction and
will lead to a better understanding of microbial behavior
in various ecological niches.

Results
Scope of the study
Bacterial signaling mechanisms are extremely diverse,
ranging from simplest two-domain transcription regulators, such as AraC or LacI, to multi-component signaling
cascades that regulate sporulation, flagellar biosynthesis
or biofilm formation. Until recently, the term 'signal
transduction' has been typically reserved for the two-component systems consisting of a sensor histidine kinase
(HK) and a response regulator (RR). In keeping with this
tradition, I did not include in this survey single-component transcriptional regulators, whether of AraC type [52]
or much more complex NorR type [53] and considered
only dedicated signaling systems that consist of more than
two individual components. In addition to HKs, these
included Ser/Thr protein kinases, adenylate and diguanylate cyclases and two types of predicted c-di-GMP phosphodiesterases, containing, respectively, EAL or HD-GYP
domains. Other enzymatic output domains as well as
DNA- or RNA-binding response regulators have not been
considered here but could be added to the list in the
future. Because of the previously noted parallelism

BMC Microbiology 2005, 5:35

between the domain architectures of intracellular signaling proteins (e.g. PAS-GGDEF-EAL) and respective
response regulators (e.g. CheY-PAS-GGDEF-EAL) [3], no
attempt has been made to distinguish such proteins; they
were counted both in the GGDEF and EAL columns. Naturally, such proteins were counted only once to obtain the
total number of signaling proteins encoded in any given
genome.
The data set included complete bacterial and archaeal
genomes sequenced by the end of 2004. While Archaea
and Bacteria are generally considered separate domains of
life in the prokaryotic world, there are indications that
many signal transduction systems in archaea have been
acquired from bacteria through lateral gene transfer
[2,32]. Hence, for the purposes of this study, domain
Archaea was treated as just another bacterial phylum.
Owing to the redundancy of the current genome list, only
one representative genome per species was used in the
analysis, typically the first one to be publicly released.
Exceptions included two strains of Escherichia coli, K12
and O157:H7 [54,55], and three serovars of Salmonella
enterica, Typhi, Typhimurium, and Paratyphi [56-58].
Data validation
The total numbers of copies of each signaling domain
encoded in each given genome were estimated in iterative
PSI-BLAST [59] searches, using the strict inclusion threshold expect values of 10-7–10-4, adjusting as necessary.
Potential false-positive hits were checked at every step of
PSI-BLAST using the CDD Domain viewer [60] and manually removed (unselected) from the hit list for the next
iteration of PSI-BLAST. The most typical sources of the
false-positive hits were as follows.

Histidine kinases consist of two separate domains, (i) a
well-conserved ATPase domain of the GHKL family
[61,62], referred to as HATPase_c domain [Pfam:PF02518
http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pfam/getacc?PF02518]
in the Pfam database [14], and (ii) a less-conserved phosphoacceptor (dimerization) domain, carrying the phosphorylatable His residue [7,63]. The dimerization
domains are quite diverse in their sequence and comprise
the His Kinase A (phosphoacceptor) domain clan in
Pfam, which unifies four individual domain families:
HisKA [Pfam:PF00512 http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/
Pfam/getacc?PF00512], HisKA_2 [Pfam:PF07568 http://
www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pfam/getacc?PF07568],
HisKA_3 [Pfam:PF07730 http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgibin/Pfam/getacc?PF07730, and HWE_HK [Pfam:PF07536
http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pfam/getacc?PF02518].
Due to the great variability of the HisKA domains, the
results of PSI-BLAST search are largely determined by the
presence of the HATPase_c domain and often include
other members of the GHKL family, such as DNA gyrase B

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/35

and DNA repair protein MutL, as well as anti-sigma F factors (SpoIIAB-like Ser/Thr kinases). Due to the presence of
long α-helices in the phosphoacceptor domains, they
sometimes show spurious low-complexity hits.
Methyl-accepting protein (MCP) domain (PF00015)
[Pfam:PF00015 http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pfam/
getacc?PF00015] contains long α-helices, which also
attract low-complexity hits. However, the extremely high
conservation of the (LI)LALNAAIEAARAGExGRGFAVVAxEVR sequence pattern allows a relatively easy recognition of false-positive hits.
Ser/Thr/Tyr
kinase
(STYK)
domain
(PF00069)
[Pfam:PF00069 http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pfam/
getacc?PF00069] belongs to the Protein kinase superfamily clan in Pfam [14]. Other members of this clan,
such as kinases of kanamycin, streptomycin, methylthioribose, homoserine, choline, and 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (KDO), are often retrieved in PSI-BLAST
searches. In fact, the latter enzyme, KDO kinase (product
of the waaP gene, PF06293 [Pfam:PF06293 http://
www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pfam/getacc?PF06293]) often
gives much better BLAST scores than certain divergent Ser/
Thr kinases. Most of the discrepancies between the data
presented here and those in the KinG database [64,65]
could be attributed to those false-positive hits. The most
common false-negative hits were the putative protein
kinases of ABC1/AarF family (PF03109 [Pfam:PF03109
http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pfam/getacc?PF03109]
or COG0661 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/new/
release/cow.cgi?view=1&cog=COG0661]), which are
somehow involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis, most
likely by regulating this pathway [66]. It should be noted
that although members of the ABC1 (activity of bc1) family are sometimes misannotated as ABC transporters or
even ABC transporter substrate binding proteins, this
appears to be due to a simple misunderstanding, which I
have ignored and counted these proteins as protein
kinases.
GGDEF domains (PF00990 [http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgibin/Pfam/getacc?PF00990] from diverse bacteria have
diguanylate cyclase activity [23,24] and are structurally
related to the eukaryotic adenylate cyclase (AC3) domains
[67]. While PSI-BLAST searches of GGDEF domains rarely
produced any false positive hits, many GGDEF-related
domains appeared to be inactivated, some were clearly
truncated. The latter ones were excluded from the total
count. The most interesting example included a conserved
family
of
proteins
(COG3887
[http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/new/release/
cow.cgi?view=1&cog=COG3887]) comprising a fusion of
a modified (likely inactivated) GGDEF domain and the
DHH-family
(PF01368

phosphoesterase domain. Members of this family are
encoded in genomes of most Firmicutes, including tiny
genomes of some Mycoplasma spp., but their function
remains unknown.

and PF00211 [Pfam:PF00211 http://www.sanger.ac.uk/
cgi-bin/Pfam/getacc?PF00211], respectively) did not
return any false-positive hits in PSI-BLAST searches.
HD-GYP domain is a variant of the widespread HD-type
phosphohydrolase (PF01966 [Pfam:PF01966 http://
www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pfam/getacc?PF01966], [69])
domain that contains a C-terminal subdomain with extra
conserved residues [26]. Classical HD domains without
the second subdomain often showed up as false-positive
hits; these were filtered based on the total length of the
BLAST alignment.
Whenever possible, the domain and protein counts were
compared to the published data and all discrepancies
were manually verified. Thus, this census has identified 92
HKs in Bradyrhizobium japonicum, 62 HKs in Mesorhizobium loti, and 48 HKs in Sinorhizobium meliloti [see Additional file 1], which was much more than 80, 47 and 40
HKs, respectively, recognized in these bacteria in a recent
survey [34]. A comparison of the two sets revealed that
most of the proteins missing from the HK list by Hagiwara
et al.[34] comprise a conserved family (COG3920 [http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/new/release/
cow.cgi?view=1&cog=COG3920]) with an unusual
HisKA_2 (PF07568 [http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/
Pfam/getacc?PF07568]) dimerization domain, which,
however, still contains a conserved His residue, confirming that these proteins are true HKs. This and other comparisons showed that, in most cases, different authors
correctly identified the core sets of signaling proteins and
most discrepancies could be attributed to the different
ways of treating divergent, inactivated and truncated
sequences. The approach adopted here was to take a middle ground, not counting clearly truncated and highly
diverged sequences but keeping in the list full-length
domains that might have had inactivating point mutations. For example, although Gly?Ala and Glu?Ala
changes in the GGEE motif of the GGDEF domain have
been shown to abrogate its diguanylate cyclase activity,
sequences with such changes were still counted as diguanylate cyclases, while the truncated sequences in Methanococcus kandleri protein MK0296 [UniProt:Q8TYK1 http://

were not. Likewise, Archaeoglobus fulgidus encodes a family
of proteins that have a typical HK domain architecture but
lack the HATPase domain. Such truncated sequences were
not included in the total count [see Additional file 1] but
still listed (marked with asterisks) in the supporting files.
Since the signaling protein count was based on the
domain count, monster multidomain proteins, combining various output domains, such as the hybrid HK-STYK
[UniProt:O32393
http://www.expasy.org/uniprot/
O32393] described in Spirulina platensis [70] or the HKGGDEF combination, found in Geobacter sulfurreducens
protein
GSU3350
[UniProt:Q747B7
http://
www.expasy.org/uniprot/Q747B7], have been counted
more than once.
General trends
The census of signal transduction proteins encoded in
complete microbial genomes [see Additional file 1]
revealed several interesting trends. It has largely confirmed previous observations [2,4,71] that the total
number of regulatory proteins encoded by each given
organism genome positively correlates with the genome
size (Figure 2a) and the total number of encoded proteins
(Figure 2b): microbes with complex life styles generally
have larger genomes and encode more sophisticated and
diverse regulatory systems than parasites with their largely
degraded genomes.

While small genome size (and the correspondingly low
number of signaling systems) is often associated with
pathogenicity, there are numerous pathogens with relatively large genomes (e.g. Bordetella parapertussis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis), as well as free-living organisms with
very small genome sizes (e.g. Thermoplasma acidophilum,
Aquifex aeolicus, see Figure 2a). Many free-living archaea
encode very few, if any, proteins involved in signal transduction. For example, among 2977 proteins, encoded by
the extreme thermoacidophile Sulfolobus solfataricus, only
9 are signaling (8 STYKs and an AC2). A similar picture
has been reported in marine cyanobacteria [72] and is
seen in the recently sequenced genome of the ruminal
bacterium Mannheimia succiniproducens, which encodes
just 5 HKs, an AC, and a STYK [see Additional file 1].
Apparently, the constant and nutrient-rich ruminal environment does not require much signal transduction.
These data indicate that organisms inhabiting stable environments can get away with relatively simple signal transduction systems. In contrast, organisms that survive in
diverse ecological niches, including facultative pathogens,
such as the spirochetes Leptospira interrogans and

in simple and stable environments: Wolinella succinogenes,
another ruminal inhabitant [73], encodes many more signal transduction proteins than other bacteria with similar
genome sizes (Table 1, see below).

Bacterial IQ
The total number of signaling proteins encoded in a given
genome (or, rather, the fraction of such proteins among
all encoded in the genome) can be used as a measure of
the adaptive potential of an organism, some kind of 'bacterial IQ'. The slope of the best-fit line on Figure 2a is 2.03,
meaning that the total number of signal transduction proPage 6 of 19

teins grows approximately as a square of the genome size.
The organisms whose genomes deviate most from this
trend can be considered particularly 'smart' or 'dumb'
compared to their relatives. There could be different ways
to evaluate the relative abundance of signal transduction
proteins at the given genome size; the data in Table 1 were
calculated using the following formula:
IQ = 5 × 104 (n-5)1/2 L-1,

where n is the total number of signal transduction proteins, L is the complete genome size in kb (even counting
plasmids, it is a more consistent measure than the number
of predicted proteins), 5 × 104 and 5 are arbitrarily chosen
empirical coefficients, so that IQ = 100 corresponds to 9
signal transducers in a 1000 kb genome and to 105 transducers in a 5000 kb genome. Accordingly, the IQ value is
not defined for organisms with less than 6 signal transduction proteins.

With one exception, all organisms listed in Table 1 are
environmental gram-negative bacteria (most gram-positive bacteria and archaea scored much lower) that are
highly motile and are known to use a wide variety of electron donors and electron acceptors [73-76]. Such versatile
organisms as Chromobacterium violaceum, Desulfovibrio vulgaris, Geobacter sulfurreducens, Vibrio vulnificus, and
Wolinella succinogenes are also repeatedly found among
the leaders in individual categories (Table 2), both in
terms of absolute number of signal transduction proteins
and of their fraction among all encoded proteins. Remarkably, most of the winners come from the relatively poorly
characterized beta-, delta- and epsilon- subdivisions of
Proteobacteria. This illustrates the limitations of relying
just on Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis as model organisms for studying signaling transduction in environmental
organisms. The recent efforts on the post-genomic analysis of the versatile gamma-proteobacterium Shewanella
oneidensis [77], which encodes a decent set of 46 HKs, 26
MCPs, 7 STYKs, 3 ACs and 52 GGDEF, 28 EAL, and 9 HDGYP domains [see Additional file 1] might be a step in the
right direction. In contrast, E. coli appears to have a relatively low IQ. Although its 30 HKs, 19 GGDEF and 17 EAL
domains at first seemed like a high number [16,26], E.
coli, as well as Salmonella spp. and Yersinia spp., other
members of Enterobacteriaceae, looks pretty 'dumb' compared to the representatives of Pseudomonadaceae, Vibrionaceae, or Xanthomonadaceae, particularly with respect to
chemotaxis: any sequenced member of the three latter
families encodes many more MCPs than the meager 5
MCPs in E. coli. The deep-sea bacterium Idiomarina loihiensis, which belongs to yet another gamma-proteobacterial
lineage and whose protein set is just 62% of that of E. coli
[78], encodes more diguanylate cyclases and 3 times more
MCPs than E. coli. The delta-proteobacterium Bdellovibrio
bacteriovorus, a predator that infects an E. coli cell and
grows in its periplasmic space, also turned out to have a
higher IQ: it has a smaller genome than E. coli but encodes
almost twice as many HKs and four times more MCPs.
Phylogenetic distribution of signaling systems
Histidine kinases are by far the predominant type of sensory proteins (Figure 1), whose distribution in all
sequenced organisms generally follows the power law
(Figures 3a and 4a). The relative abundance of other types
of receptors, however, varies widely among organisms of
different phylogenetic lineages (Figure 3b–f). Still, the distribution of their total number also follows power law
(Figure 4b). These observations will be analyzed in detail
elsewhere. The following is just a brief listing of several
unexpected trends:

1. Archaea do not encode AC1- or AC3-type adenylate
cyclases, diguanylate cyclases or c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterases (with the exception of several highly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/35

diverged and probably inactive ORFs), but encode a fair
amount of STYKs. In 11 of 20 archaeal genomes, STYKs
and class 2 ACs are the only recognizable proteins
involved in signal transduction. More than a half of all
sequenced archaeal genomes do not encode any MCPs,
others encode from 2 to 5 and only the two halophilic
species have a large number of MCPs (17 each, Figure 3b).
2. Actinobacteria do not encode MCPs or, for that matter,
any other chemotaxis or flagellar proteins (the only one
that does, Symbiobacterium thermophilum, probably does
not belong to the actinobacterial lineage [79]). Instead,
actinobacteria encode relatively large numbers of HKs and
STYKs (Figure 3a,c). As noted previously, Mycobacterium
tuberculosis encodes a relatively high number of AC3s [80],
as do two other mycobacteria, M. bovis and M. avium, but
not M. leprae (16, 16, 12, and 4, respectively). The regulators of these AC3s remain unknown, although some ACs
have been implicated in sensing of the bicarbonate level
[81]. The dramatically lower number of signaling proteins
in M. leprae, compared to other mycobacteria, is in line
with the general picture of genome decay in this organism
[82].
3. Cyanobacteria encode large numbers of HKs and
STYKs, but very few MCPs (e.g. 134, 52 and 3,
respectively, in Nostoc PCC 7120 [see Additional file 1]).
These data are consistent with previous observations that
cyanobacteria encode just several highly conserved MCPs
[37] and regulate their motility using HKs (phytochromes) [83,84] and ACs [27,28].
4. There is great variation between different subdivisions
of Proteobacteria with very few common trends. Proteobacteria generally encode few, if any, STYKs, but a large
number of MCPs and diguanylate cyclases. The number of
ACs is relatively low, except for representatives of the
alpha-subdivision. While gamma-proteobacteria typically
encode a single AC1 and no more than one AC3, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa this sole AC3 is important for virulence [85].
5. Several bacterial phyla that currently have only a handful of sequenced representatives show highly biased patterns of signal transducer distribution. For example, four
sequenced members of the Bacteroidetes (formerly the
CFB group) encode a relatively large number of HKs (85
in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron), but few or no STYKs and
no MCPs, ACs or diguanylate cyclases. It would be
interesting to see if this trend holds when more genomes
of this lineage become available.
Variation in IQ between close relatives
The recent genomic data revealed substantial differences
in gene content among different strains that, judging by

the level of 16S rRNA identity, belong to the same bacterial species [86,87]. It is therefore not surprising to see dramatic differences in signaling protein content among
different species of the same genus. Still, different members of the Bacillus genus show very similar distributions
of signaling proteins [see Additional file 1]. In contrast,
three sequenced genomes of Clostridium spp. encode
dramatically different numbers of MCPs (38 in C. acetobutylicum, 20 in C. tetani and 0 in C. perfringens) and HDGYP domains (9, 1, and 1, respectively), whereas the content of other signaling proteins is more or less in line with
the genome sizes. Accordingly, C. acetobutylicum makes it
into the winners list in both MCP and HD-GYP categories
(Table 2).
Although not seen in the current data set, domains that
are missing in one strain were sometimes found in a
different strain of the same species. Thus, although this
domain census shows the absence of HD-GYP domains in
Yersinia pestis strain CO92 and in Bacillus cereus strain

ATCC 14579 [see Additional file 1], this domain is
encoded in Y. pestis strain KIM and B. cereus strain ZK.
These differences indicate that signaling proteins can be
easily acquired and lost, so all observations on the presence or absence of certain signaling system in a certain
organism are only as good as the current genome set.
Transmembrane and intracellular sensors: Extroverts and
introverts
Analysis of complete microbial genomes revealed complex systems of intracellular monitoring that included
PAS- and GAF-containing proteins with a variety of output
domains [3]. The fraction of membrane-bound proteins
among all signal transduction proteins encoded in each
given genome was evaluated here using three different
methods for predicting transmembrane (TM) segments,
followed by manual analysis of the outputs. The census
showed that while the great majority of HKs and MCPs
were membrane-bound, as much as one-third of all HKs
and one-sixth of all MCPs did not contain a single TM seg-

ment (Figure 1, Additional file 1). In contrast, only about
a half of all adenylate and diguanylate cyclases and c-diGMP phosphodiesterases were membrane-bound; a
majority of STYKs and HD-GYP domains were soluble
(Figure 1).
It must be noted that not every membrane-bound signal
transduction protein is necessarily a sensor of the environmental parameters. An obvious example among HKs is
the turgor sensor KdpD, where TM segments serve solely
as anchors [88]. Aer, the energy-sensing MCP, presents a
similar case [89]. Conversely, some cytoplasmic sensors
might actually sense extracellular signals, e.g. when the
sensing domains are present on separate transmembrane
polypeptides, as is the case with CheA, the chemotaxis
HK. Furthermore, many cytoplasmic sensors respond to
signals that are membrane-permeable, such as light, oxygen, H2O2; NH3, and should not be considered purely
external or internal. Keeping in mind all these caveats, the
predominance of extracellular or intracellular transducers
can be used to distinguish organisms that are concerned
primarily with sensing environmental parameters ("extroverts") from those more closely monitoring the intracellular milieu ("introverts").
In obligately parasitic bacteria that encode only a handful
of signal transduction proteins, most of these proteins are
membrane-bound [see Additional file 1]. However, Figure

5a shows that once the total number of signal transduction proteins goes beyond a dozen, the fraction of them
that are membrane-bound stabilizes at about 60%,
approximately the same in representatives of all phyla,
except for Cyanobacteria and Archaea. In the latter two
groups, the fraction of membrane-bound signal
transduction proteins is close to 30% and also shows very
little variance (Figure 5a). Although, as mentioned above,
cyanobacteria encode very few MCPs, this fact alone cannot account for the difference between them and all other
bacteria. A comparison of other types of signaling proteins
encoded in cyanobacteria and proteobacteria (Figure 5b)
shows the prevalence of soluble proteins among cyanobacterial HKs, STYKs and GGDEF domains, compared to
the prevalence of TM proteins among the same groups of
proteins in proteobacteria. The difference between cyanobacterial and archaeal proteins on one hand and proteins
from other lineages is most clearly seen in the comparison
of HKs (Figure 5c). Remarkably, actinobacteria and firmicutes turn out to be firm extroverts with relatively few
intracellular HKs; some of the latter, however, are known
to participate in regulation of sporulation [6]. This schism
between cyanobacteria and all other bacteria with completely sequenced genomes is likely to be due to the much
more complex organization of the cyanobacterial cell,
which contains intracellular membranes harboring the

teins is seen in methanogenic archaea and in the green
sulfur bacterium Chlorobium tepidum, although not in the
phototrophic alpha-proteobacterium Rhodopseudomonas
palustris [see Additional file 1]. Since archaeal heterotrophs also show low amounts of TM signaling proteins,
there does not seem to be a direct connection between
'introvertness' and autotrophic metabolism.

Discussion
This paper has grown out of a survey of signal transduction systems in several alpha- and gamma-proteobacteria
prepared for a recent review (Table 1 in ref [3]). It turned
out that mere 'counting the senses' could help understand
bacterial behavior. For example, as discussed earlier,
genomes of two alpha-proteobacteria, Caulobacter crescentus and Mesorhizobium loti, encode the same number of
HKs but the former one encodes 19 MCPs compared to
just one in M. loti [see Additional file 1]. In contrast, M.
loti encodes 13 copies of AC3, compared to just two of
them in C. crescentus ([3], [see Additional file 1]). Such
observations could provide a useful insight into the
physiology of many obscure bacteria whose genomes
have been sequenced in the last several years or will be
sequenced in the near future. I have therefore updated our
previous listing of signal transduction proteins encoded in
microbial genomes [2] to cover the genomes sequenced in
the past five years.

Defining the set of signaling proteins
For the purposes of this study, the set of surveyed signal
transduction proteins has been limited to just 7 classes of
proteins: histidine kinases, methyl-accepting chemotaxis
receptors, Ser/Thr protein kinases, adenylate and diguanylate cyclases, c-di-GMP phosphodiesterases with the EAL
domain and predicted phosphodiesterases with the HDGYP domain [see Additional file 1]. Certainly, this list is
far from being complete. In a general sense, any cellular
protein that participates in cellular adaptation to the
changing environment can be considered part of the signaling machinery. Thus, AraC-type transcription regulator,
whose DNA-binding properties are modulated by arabinose binding to its N-terminal domain [52], could also
be treated as an intracellular signal transducer. According
to a recent study by Ulrich, Koonin, and Zhulin, such
'one-component' signalers comprise a majority of signal
transduction systems and were the first to arise in evolution [90]. More sophisticated mechanisms of signal transduction include two-component (HK and RR) signal
transduction systems and a variety of other signaling systems that have been described only in the past several
years (see [2,3,21,22,39] for reviews).

This census considered only dedicated signaling systems
that consist of more than two individual components.
Therefore, transcriptional regulators, even those of complex domain architecture, were left out (for a comprehensive survey of helix-turn-helix-type (HTH) transcriptional

Page 11 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Microbiology 2005, 5:35

regulators, see [91]). I have also left out response regulators, which are typically considered together with HKs.
One of the reasons for that was the frequent confusion
between three classes of response regulators: (i) the singledomain chemotaxis response regulator CheY that transmits the signal through protein-protein interactions; (ii)
the DNA-binding response regulators of the CheY-HTH
domain architecture, and (iii) the response regulators
with CheY-AC, CheY-GGDEF or CheY-GGDEF-EAL
domain architectures, which produce secondary messengers, cAMP and c-di-GMP. Here, various proteins containing AC, GGDEF, EAL or HD-GYP domains have been
lumped together, just as the chemotaxis signal transduction kinase CheA is typically treated as sensor kinase,
despite being just a transmitter in the signaling cascade
going from MCPs to the flagellar motor. This approach
differed from that of Ulrich et al. [90], who included
diguanylate cyclases and c-di-GMP phosphodiesterases
(GGDEF and EAL domains, respectively) into the 'onecomponent' set.
Another important omission in this survey are Ser/Thr
protein phosphatases, which can dephosphorylate STYKs,
modulating their activity, and should also be able to
dephosphorylate the cellular targets of STYKs. However,
several surveys of these enzymes have been published
recently [19,39,92], and more are apparently on the way.
Due to the difficulties in separating true protein phosphatases from phosphatases of other specificities that
often produce false-positive hits I have chosen to exclude
them from this survey. Several other systems of the bacterial signal transduction machinery have also been left out.
These include (i) Ser/Thr kinases of the bacterial (GHKL)
type that regulate the activity of the RNA polymerase
sigma subunit; (ii) HPrSer kinase/phosphorylase and other
components of the bacterial PEP-dependent phosphotransferase systems, which regulate chemotaxis, membrane transport (inducer exclusion), and catabolite
repression; (iii) the systems that regulate RNA and protein
degradation; and many others. A census of each of these
systems could be an interesting project in its own right.
The limited scope of this survey, which did not include the
sophisticated sporulation machinery of the firmicutes and
certain unique (potentially signaling) archaeal domains,
could be a reason why representatives of these two groups
have generally scored low in the IQ category. Including
those proteins into a future version of this census might
partly correct that bias, although that would increase the
degree of 'introvertness' among archaea even further.
Caveats of automated domain counting
Even within the limited scope of this survey, there is a lot
of space for controversy. There are no clear criteria to
decide which proteins should be considered HKs or STYKs

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/35

and which should be not. Thus, the discrepancies of the
results presented here and in the papers by the Mizuno
group [5,16,34] can all be attributed to their more conservative approach to defining HKs. The survey by Kim
and Forst [17] shows a similar undercount of non-canonical HKs. In contrast, counting STYKs in the KinG database
[64] used more permissive criteria than those employed
here, which resulted in KDO kinases and other related
kinases being counted as STYKs. For other signaling
domains, there was much less room for disagreement. The
counts of MCPs and ACs, presented here, are very similar
to those reported, respectively, by Zhulin [40] and Shenoy
and Visweswariah [41]. All our data with supporting
information are available on a public web site [51], which
should provide an easy way to analyze any discrepancies
and, if necessary, correct the final count.
Do numbers really matter?
It is well known that growth in bacterial genome size is
accompanied by accumulation of paralogous protein
families, which can be easily seen in lineage-specific
expansions of transcriptional regulators, metabolic
enzymes, and/or surface proteins [93-95]. It can be argued
therefore that the sheer number of signal transduction
proteins encoded in a bacterial genome is hardly a good
measure of its IQ, as many of these proteins are closely
related paralogs. It would seem, however, that lineagespecific expansions that have been fixed in evolution must
be of some value to the host organism. Among metabolic
enzymes, there are indications of functional diversification even among close paralogs [96]. As for signaling proteins, Valley Stewart and colleagues have shown that
NarQ and NarX, two paralogous HKs in E. coli, have similar but non-identical functions in modulating cellular
response to nitrate and nitrite [97,98]. Likewise, out of 12
GGDEF domain-containing proteins – potential diguanylate cyclases – encoded in Salmonella Typhimurium
genome, one, AdrA, was found to be primarily
responsible for regulating biofilm formation in a complex
medium, whereas another, STM1987, was critical for biofilm formation in the nutrient-poor medium [99,100].
These data show that we should be very careful in assigning the same function even to closely related paralogs. Differential regulation of expression and activity of
paralogous signal transduction proteins could be yet
another sophisticated mechanism allowing the bacterial
cell to fine-tune its response to environmental changes.
Therefore, until there is clear evidence that functions of
paralogous signal transduction proteins are truly identical, the total number of such proteins remains the best
measure of the bacterial IQ.
Intracellular signaling
One of the most significant insights to emerge from comparative genome analysis was the recognition of the vast

Page 12 of 19

BMC Microbiology 2005, 5:35

system of intracellular signaling in bacteria. It became
clear that many bacteria encode complex systems of intracellular monitoring whose domain organization is very
similar to that used in transmembrane signaling: a sensor
domain (typically, PAS and/or GAF), followed by HK, AC,
GGDEF or EAL output domains [3]. In certain cases, soluble HKs, MCPs, and ACs have been experimentally characterized and shown to be involved in monitoring levels
of intracellular ATP, oxygen, CO, bicarbonate, nitrate,
reactive nitrogen species, and other metabolites and modulating the cellular response to the changes in these
parameters [101-105]. Some intracellular sensors
appeared to be specifically geared towards unusual substrates used by the particular bacterium, such as methanol
and formaldehyde in Paracoccus denitrificans and Methylobacterium organophilum [106,107]. In the recently
sequenced genome of Dehalococcoides ethenogenes, a major
detoxifier of chlorinated organic pollutants, many soluble
HKs were found encoded in close proximity to the genes
for reductive halogenases, the enzymes that catalyze the
dechlorination reactions [108]. It was proposed that these
HKs respond to intracellular rather than extracellular
stimuli, stimulating the expression of reductive halogenases in response to the presence of their chlorinated substrates [108].
This census shows that intracellular signal transduction
proteins comprise a significant fraction of all signal transducers encoded in almost any bacterial genome. However,
most of them are still uncharacterized and have yet to be
recognized as legitimate members of the bacterial signaling network. The finding that these proteins are abundant
in many pathogenic as well as free-living bacteria should
help focus the attention of the research community on
these novel components of the signal transduction
network.
The predominance of intracellular signal transduction
proteins in cyanobacteria is in stark contrast with the far
smaller proportion of such proteins in other bacterial lineages. There could be several possible reasons for this
'introvertness', all linked to the ability of cyanobacteria to
conduct oxygenic photosynthesis. Firstly, cyanobacteria
harbor a complex system of intracellular membranes carrying the photosynthetic reaction centers. Intracellular signaling proteins could be needed to control formation and
functioning of the photosynthetic system, as well as the
transition from phototrophic to heterotrophic
metabolism and back. The compartmentalization of the
cellular interior probably requires a sophisticated system
of monitoring conditions within the individual compartments. Last but not the least, cyanobacteria are unique
among (known) prokaryotes in that their cells generate
oxygen, which other bacteria try to keep outside the cell.
The presence of oxygen affects the redox balance in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/35

cytoplasm and leads to oxidative damage of numerous
cellular compounds, including ATP, methionine, cysteine,
and many others. It is very likely that numerous intracellular HKs that contain PAS domains are involved in maintaining the constant level of the redox potential in the
cyanobacterial cell. Surprisingly, Rhodopseudomonas palustris, an alpha-proteobacterium that is also capable of transition
between
autotrophic
and
heterotrophic
metabolism, does not appear to be an 'introvert' [see
Additional file 1]. Hence, it seems that the trend of
autotrophic bacteria and archaea being more of 'introverts' and heterotrophic bacteria being more of 'extroverts'
might be biased by the current selection of the completely
sequenced genomes. It would be interesting to see
whether this trend holds when more genomes of bacterial
photo- and chemolitotrophs become available.
Phylum-specific bias and evolution of signal transduction
The knowledge of the phylogenetic distribution of signal
transduction systems allows a better understanding of
their evolution. Previous analysis of HKs and RRs by
Koretke and colleagues led to the conclusion that twocomponent systems originated in bacteria and radiated
into two other domains of life through multiple events of
horizontal gene transfer [32]. HKs and STYKs appear to be
the principal signal transduction proteins in archaea, suggesting that these two classes of proteins could be already
present in the last common ancestor of all living organisms (LUCA, [92,109,110]). The absence of AC3-type adenylate cyclases, diguanylate cyclases and c-di-GMP
phosphodiesterases in any of the sequenced archaeal
genomes is quite remarkable. In fact, the only full-size
archaeal AC3 domain known to date has been found in an
uncultivated psychrophilic crenarchaeote that exhibited
numerous cases of horizontal gene transfer [111]. Most
archaea, however, encode ACs of class 2 (COG1437
[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/new/release/
cow.cgi?view=1&cog=COG1437]), which are found in
only a handful of organisms outside Archaea [30]. These
data show that although cAMP is a truly universal second
messenger, different domains of life utilize different
enzymes for its production and probably employ entirely
different mechanisms of cAMP-dependent signaling.

Another remarkable example is the diversity of outputs of
the chemotaxis machinery. Although all MCPs counted in
this work are very similar, it has been noted [112] that
chemotactic signals in diverse bacteria and archaea are
being transduced to at least three different motility apparata: the bacterial flagellum, the archaeal flagellum that is
unrelated to the bacterial one [113], and to the type IV
pili, which are responsible for gliding motility of cyanobacteria and certain other bacteria [84,114].

In general, variability of signal transduction protein content in closely related bacteria, uneven distribution of
these proteins among well-established phylogenetic lineages, and the presence in many genomes of tight clusters
of closely related paralogs indicate that signaling proteins
can be easily acquired and lost. Lineage-specific gene
duplication and gene loss and lateral gene transfer probably play a key role in shaping the signaling protein repertoire of each given organism. Why, then, would the total
number of signal transduction proteins grow as a square
of the genome size (Figure 2a) across a wide variety of
microorganisms with diverse lifestyles, phylogenetic affinities, and metabolic capabilities? It is tempting to suggest
that there must be an underlying mechanism supporting
this correlation. For example, the power-law distribution
of HKs (Figure 4a) might stem from the simple fact that
the number of binary interactions grows as a square of the
number of interacting components [115], so that the
number of sensory proteins that manage the linearly
growing number of metabolic enzymes has to grow as a
square of that number. This explanation is somewhat similar to the one offered by van Nimwegen to explain his
observation that the number of transcriptional regulators
in bacteria also grows as a square of the genome size [71],
although his analysis did not include two-component systems. This was also the rationale behind the decision to
measure bacterial IQ as a square root, rather than a linear
function, of the total number of encoded signal transduction proteins (see the Results section). However, HKs
comprise only but a half of all signal transduction proteins counted in this work [see Additional file 1]. The distribution of other types of signal transducers is even more
fascinating: while distribution of each individual class of
proteins seems almost random (Figures 3b–f), their total
number still grows approximately as a square of genome
size (Figure 4b). One could speculate that this quadratic
dependence determines a near-optimal number of signal
transducers at a given genome size. This would mean that
during their adaptation to different ecological niches, bacteria evolve to rely primarily on certain types of signal
transduction, while other types of transducers can be lost
(or not fixed in the genome when acquired by lateral gene
transfer). For example, during the reductive evolution of
chlamydia, HKs and STYKs were retained, while all other
transducers and were lost [see Additional file 1]. In contrast, spirochetes held on to their chemotaxis transducers
but mostly lost their STYKs. The recent evidence for noncanonical roles of signal transduction proteins, e.g. regulation of gene expression by the chemotaxis system [116]
and regulation of chemotaxis by adenylate cyclases [28],
suggests that there is certain flexibility in functions of different transducers that could be used by bacterial evolution to generate even greater diversity of signal
transduction mechanisms.

Future developments
The goal of genome analysis is to predict the organism's
physiology and behavior based solely on the genomic
sequence. There has been great progress in predicting
metabolic pathways [110,117,118]; deciphering signaling
pathways so far has lagged behind. Accumulation of complete genome sequences has led to the delineation of
many new signaling and signal transduction domains and
caused a revolution on our understanding of bacterial regulatory networks [2,3,20,119].

I believe that, despite all its limitations, this census would
be useful for microbiologists, at least by highlighting still
unresolved problems in prokaryotic signal transduction.
This work should be complemented by surveys of other
components of the signal transduction machinery, including various response regulators, Ser/Thr protein phosphatases, PTS proteins, and many others. Genomes of
several environmental microorganisms, including 9-Mb
genomes of Myxococcus xanthus, Rhodococcus sp., and Gemmata obscuriglobus, have been completed and are expected
to be publicly released in the near future. Owing to their
sheer size, these genomes are likely to bring new signaling
domains and illuminate even more regulatory relations.
Myxococcus xanthus, which reportedly encodes close to 200
HKs and many STYKs, would probably become a leader in
both these categories.
The example of M. xanthus exposes certain flaws in the IQ
calculation method used in this work. This bacterium has
extremely complex behavioral patterns [114], but, at 9.1
Mb, it would need to encode more than 550 signal transduction proteins just to make it into the winners' list
(Table 1). Certainly, better ways to evaluate bacterial IQ
are needed, but that should be subject of a future work.
Still, I believe that in the era of 'systems biology' when cellular metabolic pathways are being routinely modeled on
a whole-genome level [50,120] and the cell itself is treated
more as a machine with a number of interacting parts
[121,122], it is important to keep in mind the real complexity of the signal network encoded in each given
prokaryotic genome and have an easy measure of this
complexity.
I also hope that this census will help us get a better understanding of the microbial diversity and the unique ways
that bacteria use to adapt to changing environment. Such
understanding is becoming increasingly important as our
earlier methods of controlling bacterial growth with onesize-fits-all wide-spectrum antibiotics show progressively
diminishing results.

Conclusion
Careful accounting of diverse proteins participating in
prokaryotic signal transduction shows that the complexity

Page 14 of 19

BMC Microbiology 2005, 5:35

of signaling mechanisms correlates well with the organism's genome size and the size of its proteome. The total
number of proteins involved in signal transduction, the
number of histidine kinases, and the total number of signal transduction proteins other than histidine kinases all
grow as square of the genome size. At the same time, the
fractions of the latter proteins – MCPs, STYKs, adenylate
and diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases – in the
total set vary widely depending on the organism's ecology,
metabolic properties, and phylogenetic position. The
results of this census are freely available to the public and
will be updated and corrected as necessary. The availability of this resource, as well as introduction of the concepts
of bacterial IQ, introverts and extroverts among the
prokaryotes, should help in achieving a better understanding of the microbial behavior and forces that shape
microbial genome evolution.

Methods
Data sources
Complete genome sequences of 167 bacterial and
archaeal species, sequenced by the end of 2004, were
downloaded from the NCBI's Genomes database [123] or
searched directly through the NCBI web site. Only one
representative genome per species was used, usually the
first one to be publicly released, according to the NCBI
Genomes database listing. Exceptions were made for
Escherichia coli, represented by two strains, K12 [GenBank:U00096] and O157:H7 [GenBank:BA000007], and
Salmonella enterica, represented by three serovars, ParaTyphi
[Gentyphi
[GenBank:CP000026],
and
Typhimurium
Bank:AL513382],
[GenBank:AE006468]. For Prochlorococcus marinus, strain
CCMP1375 [GenBank:AE017126] genome was used, the
middle-sized one of the three. Among other simultaneously released genomes, Staphylococcus aureus N315 [GenBank:BA000018], Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ1066
[GenBank:CP000024], and Thermus thermophilus HB27
[GenBank:AE017221] genomes were used.
A census of histidine kinases
The complete list of histidine kinases was compiled separately for each particular phylum of bacteria from the
results of BLAST searches against selected genomes using
the NCBI's Genomic BLAST tool [124], followed by iterative PSI-BLAST searches [59]. Typically, the searches used
as the query sequence the C-terminal fragment (residues
301–579) of the well-characterized histidine kinase PhoR
[UniProt:P23545
http://www.expasy.org/cgi-bin/nice
prot.pl?P23545] from Bacillus subtilis, which contains
both HisKA and HATPase domains [125], and a positionspecific scoring matrix (PSSM) derived from an alignment
of well-characterized histidine kinases (both available as
Supplementary Material). Additional searches against the
NCBI's Reference Sequence (RefSeq) database [126,127]

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/35

were performed through the NCBI BLAST web interface
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/ by limiting the
search space to the given phylum (e.g. Actinobacteria
[orgn]) and excluding reference sequences of incomplete
genomes (srcdb_refseq [prop] NOT srcdb_refseq_model
[prop]). The PSI-BLAST searches used strict inclusion
threshold expect values of 10-5–10-7 (adjusting as necessary) and were iterated until no newly retrieved sequences
belonged to HKs. The total numbers of copies of each signaling domain encoded in each given genome were estimated using the "Taxonomy Report" option in the BLAST
output. Potential false-positive hits were checked at every
step of PSI-BLAST using the CDD Domain viewer and
manually removed (unselected) from the hit list for the
next iteration of PSI-BLAST. In each case where the HATPase domain was easily recognized but HisKA domain
was not, a BLAST2sequences [128] search was performed
to check whether the HATPase domain was preceded by a
conserved region carrying a conserved His residue. The
presence of such His-containing regions would indicate
that those questionable proteins (e.g., mlr1749 [UniProt:Q98JW4
http://www.expasy.org/cgi-bin/nice
prot.pl?Q98JW4_RHILO] and other members of
COG3920
[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/new/
release/cow.cgi?view=1&cog=COG3920]) comprise legitimate HKs, contrary to the view of Hagiwara et al. [34].
Alternatively, PSI-BLAST searches were run against a local
copy of the RefSeq database, using the same query
sequence and search parameters with additional filtering
against sequences translated from unfinished genomes
(ZP_xxxxxxxx entries). The resulting hits were compared
against the NCBI Taxonomy database to ensure that they
all came from a single organism (only one genome of
each bacterial species, usually the first one to be
sequenced, was used in this analysis). Similar protocol
was used to search for histidine kinases in other bacterial
phyla.
Counting other signaling domains
Owing to the relatively high sequence conservation of the
MCP, ACyc, GGDEF, and EAL domains, manual checking
of the PSI-BLAST outputs revealed very few false-positive
hits. In the case of the two latter domains, many low-scoring proteins had numerous amino acid changes, including ones in the likely active sites (see [2,22,67]). No
attempt has been made to sort these domains into active
and inactive ones. For the HD-GYP domain, which comprises a typical HD superfamily phosphoesterase domain
with a number of additional conserved residues, highscoring BLAST hits to the standard HD domains were filtered based on the shorter length of those hits.

Identification of transmembrane receptors
Transmembrane (TM) segments in verified sets of signal
transduction proteins from various phylogenetic lineages
were predicted using PHDhtm [129] and TMHMM [130]
programs. The results were sorted into three bins: TM proteins (≥ 2 TM segments), 1 TM proteins, and soluble proteins, and the discrepancies between predictions of the
two programs were manually inspected. Comparison of
the results revealed many false-negative assignments, so
that prediction of a TM segment by either program typically turned out to be justified. Questionable cases were
also checked using the HMMTop [131] program, which,
however, produced both false-negative and false-positive
predictions of TM segments. Therefore, HMMTop assignments were considered only when supported by either
PHDhtm or TMHMM results.
