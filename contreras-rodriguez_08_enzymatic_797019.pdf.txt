Abstract
Background: The sequenced genomes of the Brucella spp. have two urease operons, ure-1 and ure-2, but
there is evidence that only one is responsible for encoding an active urease. The present work describes
the purification and the enzymatic and phylogenomic characterization of urease from Brucella suis strain
1330. Additionally, the urease reactivity of sera from patients diagnosed with brucellosis was examined.
Results: Urease encoded by the ure-1 operon of Brucella suis strain 1330 was purified to homogeneity
using ion exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatographies. The urease was purified 51-fold with
a recovery of 12% of the enzyme activity and 0.24% of the total protein. The enzyme had an isoelectric
point of 5, and showed optimal activity at pH 7.0 and 28–35°C. The purified enzyme exhibited a MichaelisMenten saturation kinetics with a Km of 5.60 ± 0.69 mM. Hydroxyurea and thiourea are competitive
inhibitors of the enzyme with Ki of 1.04 ± 0.31 mM and 26.12 ± 2.30 mM, respectively. Acetohydroxamic
acid also inhibits the enzyme in a competitive way. The molecular weight estimated for the native enzyme
was between 130–135 kDa by gel filtration chromatography and 157 ± 7 kDa using 5–10% polyacrylamide
gradient non-denaturing gel. Only three subunits in SDS-PAGE were identified: two small subunits of
14,000 Da and 15,500 Da, and a major subunit of 66,000 Da. The amino terminal sequence of the purified
large subunit corresponded to the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by ureC1. The UreC1 subunit
was recognized by sera from patients with acute and chronic brucellosis. By phylogenetic and cluster
structure analyses, ureC1 was related to the ureC typically present in the Rhizobiales; in contrast, the ureC2
encoded in the ure-2 operon is more related to distant species.
Conclusion: We have for the first time purified and characterized an active urease from B. suis. The
enzyme was characterized at the kinetic, immunological and phylogenetic levels. Our results confirm that
the active urease of B. suis is a product of ure-1 operon.

The present work describes the purification as well as the
enzymatic and phylogenomic characterization of urease
from Brucella suis strain 1330; in addition, the urease reactivity of sera from patients diagnosed with brucellosis was
examined. To our knowledge, no Brucella urease has been
previously purified and characterized. Since Brucella is a
human pathogen, it is important to obtain as much information as possible to complement databases, such as

Urease was purified from the soluble extract of B. suis
1330 using two consecutive chromatography steps that
resulted in the final isolation of a homogeneous enzyme
(Figure 1). As previously reported in the case of Mycobacterium tuberculosis [16], hydrophobic-interaction chromatography was consistently the most useful method to
purify B. suis urease. The urease was purified 51-fold, with
a recovery of 12% of total urease activity and 0.24% of the
total protein (Table 1).

Several bacterial ureases have already been purified and
characterized [5]. One of the most studied ureases is from
Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium that is able to persist in the
stomach where the pH is very acidic [8]. Urease activity is
an important colonization factor by generating ammonia
in the immediate bacterial microenvironment, thus protecting H. pylori from the deleterious effects of gastric acid
[9]. Furthermore, urease activity appears to be responsible
for the acid resistance of the invasive enteric pathogen
Yersinia enterocolitica [10]. Interestingly, some humans
have a genetic predisposition to develop reactive arthritis
following a Y. enterocolitica infection, which correlates to
their serum reactivity with the UreB subunit of Yersinia
urease [11].

Results and discussion

Absorbance (280nm)

A wide variety of environmentally and medically important bacteria produce the enzyme urease (urea amidohydrolase; EC 3.5.1.5), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of
urea, leading to the production of carbon dioxide and
ammonia [3]. This enzyme allows many soil bacteria to
use urea as a nitrogen source. Urease is also an important
virulence factor that improves survival of pathogenic bacteria under acidic conditions within the host and can also
cause direct damage to the host tissue due to ammonia,
CO2 or alkali production [4,5]. Interestingly, some species
of Rhizobiales, such as Brucellae and Bradyrhizobium BTAi1
show multiple urease clusters [6]. This reiteration so far is
found in other bacterial species, namely Streptomyces coelicolor, S. avermitilis, Pseudomonas syringae and Escherichia
coli [7].

BRENDA [12-14]. These results can then be used by experimentalists and modelers to understand, from a systems
biology point of view [15], the mode of action of enzymes
in the pathogen and how that can be modified in order to
develop new disease treatments.

Urease activity (μmol /min)

Brucella spp. causes brucellosis, a zoonotic disease still
endemic in many countries of the world. This infectious
disease affects different animal species and is transmitted
to humans in several ways, the most common through
ingestion of raw milk or other unpasteurized dairy products. The preferred ecological niche for the brucellae is
within phagosomal compartments of host macrophages;
the capacity of this bacterial pathogen to establish and
maintain chronic infections is dependent upon its ability
to replicate within these phagocytic cells [1]. Brucella
belongs to the alpha-2 subdivision of the Proteobacteria
and they are therefore phylogenetically related to the
plant cell-associated species of the genera Rhizobium and
Agrobacterium [2].

Purification data refers to a single preparation, obtained in a representative experiment. The enzyme was purified by ion exchange and hydrophobic
interaction chromatographies. Enzyme activity was determined using a spectrophotometric coupled assay with glutamate dehydrogenase. Details
are provided in Methods section.

Urease activity was always eluted as a single symmetrical
peak at 450 mM NaCl during anion exchange chromatography, and eluted at 180 mM of NH4SO4 in hydrophobic
interaction chromatography. During the chromatographic purification, all fractions were measured for urease activity and consistently produced one activity at the
same salt concentrations. The purified protein showed a
specific activity of 540 U/mg. This is in the range of urease
specific activities described for other organisms: from very
low – 8 U/mg for Rhodobacter capsulatus [17] – to as high
as 3500 U/mg in Brevibacterium ammoniagenes [18].
An SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified enzyme revealed
the presence of three protein bands with apparent molecular masses of 66,000, 15,500 and 14,000 Da; the low
molecular weight bands were poorly stained in contrast to
the large subunit (Figure 2). The stoichiometry of the subunits in bacterial ureases has been the subject of considerable investigation. Separation of individual subunits by
SDS-PAGE and integration of the staining intensities for
the multiple bands reveal near-integer values for the subunits stoichiometries, but these ratios vary for the
enzymes from different sources. It is likely that all ureases
possess equal numbers of each or their distinct subunits
polypeptides [5]. The molecular weight of the native
enzyme obtained by gel filtration on Superose was
130–135 kDa, while molecular weight obtained by nondenaturing zymograms gels, appeared as one prominent
band with a molecular weight of 157 ± 7 kDa (Figure 3).
Bacterial native ureases show a range of molecular weights
from 140 kDa in S. salivarius [19] to 300 – 600 kDa in H.
pylori [5]. The isoelectric point was 5.0, very similar to the
5.1 value of urease from Proteus penneri [20]. The predicted molecular weight for the three subunits of B. suis
urease operon 1: URE-A1 (11,129 Da), URE-B1 (11,377
Da) and URE-C1 (61,054 Da), the total molecular weight
expected is 83,520 Da, this result is very closed with the
molecular weight obtained in the polyacrylamide gradient non-denaturing gel if B. suis urease could be in a dimer
form (2). Molecular weights higher than expected for the
three subunits in the denaturing polyacrylmide gel could
be a product of aberrant running. Differences between
results in gel filtration chromatography compared with
polyacrylamide gradient non-denaturing gel could be a

product of different conformation of the standard proteins and the possible multimeric conformation of the B.
suis urease.
B. suis urease activity was present between pH 6–8 but
activity decreased sharply below pH 6. Recently the optimal pH of B. abortus urease was determined as 7.3 [21].
Similarly, the ureases from Sthaphylococcus saprophyticus, S.
salivarium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and M. tuberculosis
have a neutral optimum pH between 7 and 7.5
[16,19,22,23]. In contrast, the ureases from L. reuteri, L.
fermentum, L. ruminis, and S. mitior exhibit acidic optimal
pH values of 2, 2, 3, and 4.5 respectively [19], while H.

pylori and K. aerogenes have a slightly alkaline pH of 8.0
[8,24]. We assayed urease activity in Tris-HCl buffer at pH
8.0, as suggested by Dunn and co-workers [8]. Although
Tris has been described as an inhibitor of urease, a simple
control experiment comparing the activity in Tris-HCl and
the synthetic buffer HEPES, showed no significant difference (results not shown).
In terms of temperature stability, ureases from different
species of Lactobacillus have a very high optimal temperature between 55 to 65°C [19], and M. tuberculosis is stable
between 22 to 60°C but is inactivated above 60°C [16]. B.
suis urease was active between 10–45°C, and it was almost
completely inactivated above 45°C. The optimal activity
was observed between 28–35°C, temperatures that are
close to the corporal temperature of humans and other
animals who are hosts for this pathogen.
The kinetic study of B. suis urease showed a simple
Michaelis-Menten-type kinetic behavior (Figure 4), in
accordance with what has been described for ureases from
other organisms [5]. The Km obtained by hyperbolic
regression was 5.60 ± 0.69 mM, and a very similar value
(5.24 mM) was obtained with the still widely used

Lineweaver-Burk or double reciprocal plot (Figure 4).
Hence, B. suis urease shows a higher affinity for its substrate than the enzymes from B. abortus (13 mM) [21], P.
mirabilis (39 mM) or Providencia stuartii (12 mM) [25], but
less affinity than H. pylori whose urease has one of the
lowest Km values (0.3 mM) reported [8]. A limited correlation may exist between the value of this kinetic constant
and the ecological niche of the host organism. For example, H. pylori inhibits the gastric mucosal lining, where
low concentrations of urea are present (1.7 to 3.4 mM);
such a low kinetic constant would allow this urease to
function under close to saturation conditions despite the
low substrate concentration. In contrast, microorganisms
that are exposed to large amounts of urea such as are
found in the urinary tract or in the soil typically possess
ureases with higher Km values, such as 13, 60, and 40 to
130 mM observed for the enzymes from P. mirabilis, Sporosarcina ureae, and Bacillus pasteurii, respectively [5].
Several compounds have been described as inhibitors of
urease (for a review see [5,26]). These are potentially
important to control urease related pathogenesis of bacterial infections and in enhancing the efficiency of urea fertilizers [5]. We tested the inhibitory effect of three of these
compounds, hydroxyurea and thiourea, substrate analogues, and AHA. Both hydroxyurea and thiourea show a
competitive type of inhibition (Figure 5), with Ki of 1.04
± 0.31 mM for hydroxyurea and 26.12 ± 2.30 mM for
thiourea. These results agree well with what is described

Due to the low protein concentration of the low molecular weight bands (Figure 2), it was not possible to
sequence them. Since the active urease apoenzyme consists of UreA, UreB and UreC, it is likely that the smaller
bands correspond to UreA and UreB. In the case of 66 kDa
protein, we obtained the amino acid sequence MPARISRATYAQM; this sequence matched with B. suis UreC1
subunit (BR0270).
During the last years, several immunoreactive Brucella
proteins have been identified and evaluated against animal and human serum samples [28-30]. It is well known
that urease is the most abundant protein of H. pylori and
as a result it serves as a significant immunogen and is useful in diagnostic tests. Patients with active gastritis due to
H. pylori show significantly elevated immunoglobulin G
and A sera titers to the urease [5]. In the current study, B.
suis urease was tested for reactivity with human sera from
patients with acute and chronic brucellosis by western
blot analysis. The IgG antibodies in sera from patients
with acute and chronic brucellosis reacted against the
large subunit while the lower molecular weight subunits
were not recognized. It is possible that the smaller subunits (UreA and UreB) did not react because their concentration was too low or that they are not immunogenic. As
expected, healthy individuals were seronegative for reactivity to the UreC1 (data not shown). This is somewhat
analogous to the serum reactivity of patients recovering
from Y. entercolitica infections in which the UreB subunit
is recognized [11].
Figure 5
Inhibition of B. suis urease by thiourea
Inhibition of B. suis urease by thiourea. The concentrations of urea were 4 mM (ᮀ), 8 mM, 10 mM (Δ) and 20 mM
(×). The combination of the two graphs, Dixon plot (A) and
the parallel lines in graph (B) indicate a competitive inhibition,
with a Ki of 26.12 ± 2.30 mM determined from the intersection point of the lines in (A) [47]. Results are from a representative experiment using a single enzyme preparation.

for ureases from other bacteria: the enzyme from K. aerogenes is inhibited by thiourea with a Ki > 25 mM, and
hydroxyurea is a competitive inhibitor of the Brevibacterium ammoniagenes urease with a Ki of 0.23 mM [26]. For
AHA, we used a similar approach and obtained a competitive inhibition with Ki of 0.77 ± 0.06 mM. AHA has been
described as a potent inhibitor of ureases from bacteria
and other microorganisms [5] and the study of urease
from jack bean and K. aerogenes revealed that AHA is a
slow-binding competitive inhibitor with a very low Ki, 2.6
– 4 μM [26,27]. Our results confirm that AHA is an inhibitor of B. suis urease, with a lower Ki than thiourea and
hydroxyurea. To test AHA as a slow binding inhibitor is
beyond the scope of this study.

Although the sequenced genomes of the Brucella spp. have
two urease operons (ure-1 and ure-2), it appears that only
one is responsible for encoding an active urease. In the
case of B. abortus, Tn mutagenesis produced mutations of
ure-1, but not ure-2, resulting in decreased urease activity
[31]. Similarly, in the case of B. suis, the disruption of the
ureC2 or ureB2, genes does not affect measurable urease
activity in B. suis [16]. Thus, it is perhaps not unexpected
that the urease purified in this study was identified as that
encoded by ureC1 based on N terminal amino acid
sequencing. Moreover, the serum from humans diagnosed with brucellosis also reacted with UreC1 and supports the mutational studies that only the ure-1 operon is
used to produce urease during a Brucella infection. It is
also noteworthy that the serum from patients infected
with Y. enterocolitica also shows reactivity to the UreB subunit and is a candidate antigen involved in the induction
of reactive arthritis in the same patients [32]. This ReA
syndrome is also a typical side effect of a significant proportion of patients who have been infected with Brucella
[33,34] or with a number of other pathogens acquired
through the gastro-intestinal tract [35]. The question
remains: why are the bacterial ureases so immunodominant and are they responsible, at least in part, for the

induction of ReA as suggested by the arthritogenic peptide
theory [36].
PSI-BLAST comparisons showed that UreC1 from B. suis
has 99% of similarity with either the putative UreC1 from
B. melitensis or UreC1 from B. abortus (encoded by
BMEI0647 and BruAb1_0296 genes, respectively). Also,
high similarity values were obtained by comparison with
the alpha subunits from M. loti (81%), R. leguminosarum
(78%), S. meliloti (79%) and A. tumefaciens (78%). In contrast, the comparison with UreC2 from B. suis, B. melitensis

and B. abortus (BR1358, BMEI1652, and Bru Ab1_1355
genes, respectively), yielded lower values (around 55%, in
each case). To find the relationships of the multiple urease
clusters of B. suis, we carried out a phylogenetic and structure analysis with ureases from bacterial species with
unique or multiple clusters.
The phylogenetic tree deduced for B. suis UreC1 (BR0270,
denoted as B. suis 270) grouped it within the Rhizobiales
order (Figure 6, left). The closely related clades included
the typical UreC from other alpha (not shown), beta (Bur-

kholderia thailandensis), and gamma (P. syringae and P.
syringae tomato) proteobacterial species. However, in the
other main clade, the UreC2 (BR1358, denoted as B. suis
1358) was grouped with Yersinia and Photorhabdus species,
both from the gamma proteobacteria subdivision [bootstrap value = 100]. The unexpected phylogenetic relationship of cluster 2 possibly reflects a horizontal gene transfer
event, because both Brucella and Yersinia share the niche
(the mammalian cell), are classified as facultative intracellular pathogens and can replicate inside macrophages
[1,37]. In a closely related clade appeared two UreC from
Bradyrhizobium BTAi1 (denoted as 1962 and 4442) and
one from Pseudomonas syringae strain B728a (PSYR2197).
A similar explanation of horizontal gene transfer could be
applied, because these species are common inhabitants of
the soil and the plant rhizosphere. Also in this group were
the UreC subunits of the distant Actinobacteria species
Streptomyces coelicolor and S. avermitilis.
Interestingly, the main group relationships observed in
the phylogenetic tree for UreC were also revealed in the
structures of the urease clusters. In the alpha proteobacteria subdivision (including Silicibacter pomeroyi, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Rhodopseudomonas palustris, not shown),
the Rhizobiales and B. suis, the cluster 1 structure has the
order ureDABCEFG (Figure 6, right). A slight variation,
with the structure ureDABCFG, is present in B. japonicum,
in one of the clusters of Bradyrhizobium strain BTAi1
(denoted as 7009), in some gamma proteobacteria such
as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (not shown) and in one of the
two clusters of P. syringae strain B728a; in two last species,
the ureFG genes are located several genes downstream. A
second main structure, with the order ureABCEFGD, was
shared by B. suis cluster 2 and the Yersinia pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis and Photorabdus luminiscens clusters and with
one of the clusters of Streptomyces coelicolor and S. avermitilis (Actinobacteria). Lastly, a third structure was found
with the order ureEF(AB)CGD. This structure was present
in two of the clusters of Bradyrhizobium strain BTAi1
(genes 1962 and 4442) and in one cluster of P. syringae
strain B728a. In this case (AB) symbolizes the fusion of
ureA and ureB genes. In Streptomyces coelicolor and S. avermitilis the urease clusters consist of only ure(AB)C genes.
The conservation of the cluster and the coherence with the
phylogenetic tree among the analyzed species suggests a
coordinated evolution of genes and clusters and, perhaps,
a relationship between origin and function.

Conclusion
We have for the first time purified and characterized an
active urease from B. suis. The enzyme was characterized
at the kinetics, immnunological and phylogenetic levels.
Our results confirm that the active urease of B. suis is product of ure-1 operon.

Methods
Bacterial strains and growth
B. suis 1330 (ATCC 23444) was kindly donated by Central
Veterinary Laboratory (New Haw, Weybridge, United
Kingdom). The strain was grown on Trypticase soy agar
(Difco) supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract
(Difco) (TSA-Y) at 37°C for 48 h.
Preparation of cell extract
The crude extract was obtained by breaking the cells with
glass beads treatment as previously described [38]. The
extract was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra, 5 K (Millipore Corporation), aliquoted and stored at -20°C.
Enzyme purification
The sample was applied onto a XK26 column packed with
High Performance Q Sepharose (20 ml) equilibrated with
10 mM imidazole buffer (pH 7.0). A gradient of 0 to 1 M
NaCl was applied at a flow rate of 120 ml/h, and 5 ml fractions were collected and assayed for urease activity. Fractions with urease activity were pooled and saturated with
1.5 M ammonium sulfate. The sample was then loaded to
a XK26 column packed with Source PHE (20 ml) previously equilibrated with 100 mM sodium phosphate and
1.5 M ammonium sulfate (pH 7.0). The column was
eluted with a descending gradient from 1.5 to 0 M ammonium sulfate at a flow rate of 30 ml/h. All purification
steps were performed at 4°C using a fast protein liquid
chromatography (AKTA FPLC) system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden).
Enzyme assays
Three different assays were used: (a) Phenol red urease test.
Qualitative urease test were performed during enzyme
purification. Urease activity was monitored by observing
the color change of a phenol red pH indicator from yellow
to red, which results from a pH increase due to urea
hydrolysis. Extract fractions (10 μl) were mixed with 100
μl of assay phosphate buffer pH 7.0 containing 1 mM freeacid form of phenol red and 100 mM urea and incubated
at 28°C. (b) Spectrophotometric urease assay using phenol red.
Urease activity was quantitated spectrophotometrically as
previously described [20,39]. (c) Quantitative urease assay.
Quantitative measurements of urease activity were determined spectrophotometrically using a coupled assay with
glutamate dehydrogenase, as previously described
[31,40]. One unit of urease activity was defined as the
amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 μmol of urea per
min. Specific activities were calculated as units of urease
per mg of protein in the extract.
Protein determination
Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce, Rockford, Ill) or using

Coomassie Brilliant Blue G in a Bradford-modified assay,
as decribed [41].
Native and denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed
using polyacrylamide gradient from 5 to 10% and detection of urease on the native gel was performed as
described by Mobley et al. [5]. A kit for molecular weights
14,000–500,000 Da for non-denaturing PAGE was used
to estimate the native urease molecular weight (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, Miss.). Denaturing gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) was performed on 15% polyacrylamide gels
as described by Laemmli [42] and used to monitor purification and estimate the molecular weight of the protein.
Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue G250. A broad
molecular marker set (200,000 to 6,500 kDa, Biorad Lab,
Inc) was used as a standard.
Amino acid sequencing
For amino-terminal sequence analysis, the UreC1 putative
band resolved by SDS-PAGE was electrotransferred to a
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane [43] and the N-terminal sequence was determined by automated Edman
degradation (Synthesis and Sequencing Facility at Johns
Hopkins University). The amino-acid sequence obtained
was compared with available sequences at the website of
the National Center of Biotechnology Information [44]
using the Psi-BLAST program [45].
Molecular weight determination
The relative molecular weight of urease was estimated by
FPLC gel filtration and SDS-PAGE. Gel filtration was executed on a Superose 12 (10/300) column (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) calibrated with the
following standard markers: thryroglobulin (670 kDa),
gamma globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa),
myoglobin (17 kDa) and vitamin B12 (1.3 kDa) (BioRad). Equilibrium and elution (0.5 ml/min) were performed with 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0 containing
150 mM NaCl.
Determination of pI
The isoelectric point was determined by chromatofocusing on a MonoP FPLC column equilibrated with 25 mM
imidazole, pH 7.4 using a pH gradient from 7.0 to 4.0
(Polybuffer 74, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala,
Sweden).
Influence of temperature and pH on urease activity
Activity of urease was examined in 15 mM sodium acetate
at pH values ranging from 2, 3 and 4; in 20 mM sodium
phosphate for pH 5, 6, 7, and 8.2; and in 25 mM glycine25 mM sodium hydroxide-25 mM sodium chloride for
pH 9, 10, and 10.6. Urease samples were incubated for 5
min at 28°C in the different pH buffers. After incubation,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/121

urea was added to a final concentration of 5 mM and urease activity was determined using the quantitative coupled
assay described above. The influence of temperature on
urease activity was determined by equilibration of urease
samples at various temperatures between 5 to 70°C for 5
min in 30 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.0, and urease activities were determined by the spectrophotometric urease
assay using phenol red described above.
Determination of kinetic parameters
Kinetics studies were performed using the same coupled
assay described for specific activity determination,
described above. Km for urea was determined within a
concentration range of 0.25 to 25 mM. The reactions were
followed for 5 min and initial rates were calculated from
the linear portion of the curve. Data was fitted to irreversible single substrate Michaelis-Menten models (rectangular hyperbola) by non-weighted non-linear regression
using the program Hyperfit [46].
Inhibition studies
Thiourea, hydroxyurea and acetohydroxamic acid (AHA)
were tested as inhibitors of B. suis urease. The inhibition
studies were performed as indicated by Cornish-Bowden
[47]. Thiourea inhibition was determined using 4, 8, 15
and 20 mM of urea and, for each of these concentrations,
varying the inhibitor from 10 to 50 mM. Hydroxyurea was
used in a concentration range of 0.5 to 20 mM for the
same concentrations of substrate described before. AHA
was studied using the same substrate concentration range
and 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mM of inhibitor. In all cases, the urease
activity was determined as described before, and appropriate controls were made to ensure that none of the
inhibitors tested inhibited the auxiliary enzyme, glutamate dehydrogenase.
Human sera samples
Sera from 9 patients with brucellosis at different stages of
the disease were used. The samples were selected according to the following criteria: 5 patients had acute brucellosis as determined by the clinical symptoms and an
agglutination titer equal to or higher than 1:80, and with
positive 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) agglutination. All 5
blood cultures of acute patients were positive for B.
melitensis. The other 4 patients were considered to have
chronic brucellosis as determined by a history of persisting symptoms or relapses and persistent agglutination titers (≥ 1:20), over the course of more than one year. Sera
from 21 volunteers, without antecedents of brucellosis,
and negative to standard and 2-ME agglutination tests
were included.
Western blot
Immunoblotting was carried out by the method of Towbin and co-workers [48]. After transfer of the proteins

from SDS-PAGE, the membrane was blocked with 2%
albumin and cut in 4-mm strips. Samples of human sera
were diluted 1:20 in Tris-saline buffer (TSB), and then
added to each strip of membrane and incubated overnight
at 4°C. Following incubation the strips were washed and
0.5 ml of a 1:500 dilution of horseradish peroxidase
labeled anti-immunoglobulin G (Cappel, USA) in TBS
was added. After incubation for 1 h at 37°C, the conjugate
solution was discarded and strips were washed with TBS.
Finally, the strips were developed by the addition of 10 ml
of TBS containing 5 mg of diamino-benzidine (Gibco
BLR, USA) and 0.1% hydrogen peroxide. Prestained
molecular mass markers (Gibco BRL, USA) were used as
standards.
Phylogenetic and gene cluster analyses
The phylogenetic tree for UreC was performed with the
alignment of the corresponding amino acid sequences
with ClustalW [49] and applying the algorithm of Neighbor-Joining [50] with a bootstrap of 100 replicates, as
implemented in the Phylip package v3.2 [51]. Additionally, a tree applying the Maximum likelihood method, as
implemented in PhyML [52] was obtained with JTT distances. Identical grouping in the trees was obtained with
both methods. S. coelicolor was chosen as outgroup and
the trees were graphed with TreeView v1.6.6. [53]. For
gene context analysis, the cluster structures were defined
using the information from MBGD database [7] for each
published genome, and the Rhizobase [54] in the case of
Bradyrhizobium strain BTAi1. The genomes analyzed and
accession numbers for UreC sequences are as follows:
Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA110 (Q89UG0), Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 (Q8UCT2), Rhizobium etli CFN42
