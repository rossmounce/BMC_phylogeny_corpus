Abstract
Background: Six nucleotide (nt) insertion in the 5’-noncoding region (NCR) of the nucleoprotein (NP) gene of
Newcaslte disease virus (NDV) is considered to be a genetic marker for recent genotypes of NDV, which emerged
after 1960. However, F48-like NDVs from China, identified a 6-nt insert in the NP gene, have been previously
classified into genotype III or genotype IX.
Results: In order to clarify their phylogenetic position and explore the origin of NDVs with the 6-nt insert and its
significance in NDV evolution, we determined the entire genome sequences of five F48-like viruses isolated in
China between 1946 and 2002 by RT-PCR amplification of overlapping fragments of full-length genome and rapid
amplification of cDNA ends. All the five NDV isolates shared the same genome size of 15,192-nt with the recent
genotype V-VIII viruses whereas they had the highest homology with early genotype III and IV isolates.
Conclusions: The unique characteristic of the genome size and phylogenetic position of F48-like viruses warrants
placing them in a separate geno-group, genotype IX. Results in this study also suggest that genotype IX viruses
most likely originate from a genotype III virus by insertion of a 6-nt motif in the 5’-NCR of the NP gene which had
occurred as early as in 1940 s, and might be the common origin of genotype V-VIII viruses.

Background
Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the most serious infectious diseases of birds causing major economic losses in
poultry industry[1-3]. Its causative agent, virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV), belongs to the genus Avulavirus, in the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, family
Paramyxoviridae, order Mononegaviriales[4,5]. NDVs
have a negative-sense, single-stranded continuous RNA
genome about 15,186-nt, 15,192-nt or 15,198-nt in
length [6-8] that contains six genes in the order of 3’NP-P-M-F-HN-L-5’, encoding six viral proteins (nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, matrix protein, fusion protein,
haemagglutinin-neuraminidase and large protein, respectively)[9]. Two additional proteins, V and W, are

expressed by mRNAs derived from the P gene via RNA
editing [10,11].
Phylogenetically, NDVs have been classified into two
major divisions, class I and class II [8,12]. Class I NDVs
with the genome size of 15,198-nt are occasionally isolated from wild aquatic birds and domestic poultry and
all but one of them are avirulent [8,13-16]. Class II
viruses include most virulent and some avirulent NDVs:
genotypes I-IV viruses are early lineage before 1960 with
the genome size of 15,186-nt; whereas genotypes V-VIII
are recent lineage after 1960 with the genome size of
15,192-nt [4,7,8,17,18]. Genotype I of class II contains
mainly avirulent isolates from wild waterfowl and poultry species of the world; genotype II consists of North
American isolates, which display different virulence ranging from lentogenic, mesogenic to velogenic; genotypes
III and IV viruses represent early isolates from the Far
East and Europe respectively during the first pandemic
from mid 1920 s to late 1950 s; NDV strains isolated

from the second pandemic during 1960 s and 1970 s
belong to new genotypes V and VI; subtype VIb viruses
are responsible for the third pandemic of pigeon origin
during the 1980 s; novel genotypes of VIII and VII
(many subgenotypes) which result in the fourth and latest pandemic have emerged since late 1980 s in the Far
East, Europe, and South Africa [8,19-21].
NDV strain F48 ("F48E8” or “F48E9” was used in previous publications in which E8 or E9 means the 8th or
9th egg-passage of the original virus) was isolated from a
diseased chicken in Northern China in 1946 and has
been used as standard challenge strain for vaccine evaluation in this country [21-23]. The phylogenetic grouping of F48-like viruses is controversial in the literature:
genotype IX of class II by some researchers
[14-16,21,23,24] while genotype III by others for their
highest homology of F gene with genotype III viruses
[8,25,26]. At all events, it is evident that genotype IX is
a sister clade of genotype III isolates which emerged in
1930 s. On the other hand, F48-like viruses have the 6nt insert in the 5’-NCR of NP gene, which is considered
to be a genetic marker of NDV strains emerged after
1960 [7,8]. However, the full-length genome of F48-like

Page 2 of 11

NDVs has not been determined. In order to clarify the
phylogenetic position of F48-like viruses and explore the
origin of NDVs with 6-nt insert and its significance in
NDV evolution, five F48-like viruses isolated in China
between 1946 and 2002 were characterized and
sequenced.

Results
Analysis of genome size

To determine the exact genome size of F48-like NDV
isolates, the full-length genome sequences were compiled from sequences of nine overlapping cDNA fragments along with the sequences of the GC-rich region
of NP gene and both ends of the genomes. Those
sequences were submitted to GenBank and the accession number was FJ436302 - FJ436306. The results of
sequencing displayed that these F48-like NDVs carried
6-nt insert in the 5’-NCR of the NP gene, the same as
that of genotypes V-VIII NDVs which emerged after
1960 s (see Figure 1). Besides, no other insert or deletion was found when compared with all known NDV
isolates. Therefore, the genome size of all the five genotype IX isolates was 15,192-nt, just as predicted before.

Moreover, those 5 viruses isolated during 1948-2002
shared 99% nucleotide sequence identity of their genomes and the same 6-nt insert motif CCCCCC.
Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic analysis of the five F48-like NDV strains
together with NDVs representing the established genotypes was first performed using the variable region
seqences (nt 47-420) of the F gene (Figure 2). The tree
consisted of two major divisions, class I and class II, the
latter was further divided into two lineages, early and
recent. The early lineage included five genotypes (I to
IV and IX) while the recent lineage consisted of four
genotypes (V to VIII). It is obvious that F48-like strains
(genotype IX) were close to but diverged from the early
genotypes III and IV strains, forming a separate
subclade.
Table 1 shows the range of F gene sequence similarity
of NDV strains within one genotype and between different genotypes. The sequence similarity of F gene
between genotype IX and III was the highest, ranging
from 91.2% to 94.3%. The sequence similarity of other
genes between genotype IX and III NDVs was also the
highest when compared with those between genotype IX
and other genotypes (data not shown).
Indeed, no matter which gene was used, the phylogenetic trees indicated very similar relationship of genetic
groups. Figure 3 is the phylogenetic tree based on the
entire genome sequences of the five F48-like NDVs in
this study and those of other NDVs representing genotypes I through VIII which are available from the GenBank. The phylogenetic position of the F48-like NDVs
here is consistent with the tree in Figure 2. Genotype IX
strains were also clustered into early lineage, closely
related with but diverged from genotypes III and IV
strains.
GC content of the genomic sequences

The GC content of the sequences of Newcastle disease
virus is also an important molecular characteristic. In
table 2, we calculated the GC content of different
region from 25 strains of NDV, including the entire
genome, 6 complete viral genes, and also the 5’ NCR
of NP gene in which extra 6 nt were detected. It was
noted that the GC content of full-length genome of all
the 25 NDV strains were similar, however, the GC
content of 5’ NCR of NP gene showed significant difference. The 5’ NCR of NP gene of genotype IV-IX
NDV strains displayed more than 60% GC content,
while that of genotype I and II strains showed about
53% and 55% GC content. Interestingly, the GC content of Genotype III strains in the same region was
about 58%, higher than genotype I and II NDVs but
lower than genotype IV-IX NDVs.

Molecular characterization of F protein

All the genotype IX strains in this study as well as other
genotype IX isolates whose F gene sequences are available in the Genbank displayed the F protein cleavage
site motif as 112RRQRR↓F117, the same as that of genotype III-IV strains (Figure 4). This finding is coincident
with the biological characteristics of F48, which is used
as the standard challenge strain in China (ICPI, 1.99).
Moreover, F protein of genotype IX NDVs also had six
potential N-glycosylation sites which were highly conserved among NDV isolates. The transmembrane (TM)
and cytoplasmic regions of genotype IX NDVs contained
several conserved substitutions and a non-conserved N
for D substitution at residue 545.
Molecular characterization of HN protein

NDV strains of different genotypes show differences in
the size of the HN protein which is the major determinant for virulence. The HN protein of all genotype IX
strains is 571 amino acids long, the same size as HN of
genotypes III-VIII viruses. The HN proteins of genotype
IX strains contained all the six sites N-linked potential
glycosylation sites at position 119, 341, 433, 481, 508,
and 538 [27,28]. In addition, the HN of genotype IX
NDVs contained positions E401, R41 and Y526 associated with receptor binding, and residues R174, R416
and R498 involving in NA activity [29-31].
Alignment of untranslated region of NDV genome

Figure 5 shows the alignment of the leader (A) and trailer (B) sequences of genotype IX NDVs with those of
other genotype strains. Genotype IX NDVs contained
the same gene-start (GS) signal and gene-end (GE) signal which are highly conservative for all NDV strains.
Besides, the NP-P intergenic region of only one nucleotide was G in most genotype I-II NDV strains, whereas
it was A in genotype IX NDV strains as well as genotype
III-VIII strains. Several unique nucleotide substitutions
were found in trailer region of genotype IX viruses, for
example, C15095, C15107, C15125, and C15151 (Figure
5B).

Discussion
The outbreaks of the genotype V-VIII NDVs were still
an enima in the history of NDV evolution. Where did
those viruses come from? Did they evolve directly from
genotype I, II or III? The genetic character that
obviously differentiating those viruses from early genotypes was the six nucleotide (nt) insertion in the 5’-noncoding region (NCR) of the nucleoprotein (NP) gene.
In this study, the 5 viruses isolated from 1948 to 2002
displayed the genome size of 15,192 nt due to the same
6-nt insert CCCCCC in the NP gene. However, those
NDV strains shared high identity with genotype III, and

The nucleotide sequence similarity of NDV strains were calculated by the MegAlign program in the Lasergene package (DNASTAR Inc. Madison, WI 53715, USA).
30 sequences of full-length genome together with more than one hundred sequences of complete F gene were involved.

were obviously clustered in a sister clade of genotype III
in phylogenetic trees (see Figure 2, 3). It is well known
that genotype III is a typical “early” NDV geno-group,
while 6-nt insert of NP is characteristic of “recent” genotypes[8]. That is to say, two contradictive genetic features were both identified in F48-like NDV strains,
suggesting the transitional role for those viruses in NDV
evolution.
It is reasonable to infer that genotype IX viruses most
likely originate from an early genotype III virus by the
insertion of a 6-nt motif in the 5’-NCR of the NP gene,
and recent V-VIII genotypes may come from genotype
IX viruses, or evolve directly from genotype III or IV
viruses in the same way. There are several evidence can
be provided to support this hypothesis.
Firstly, it was noteworthy that a classic genotype III
strain Australia-Victoria/32 shared the highest sequence
similarity with F48 strains. The nucleotide sequence
identity of the F, HN and L gene of Australia Victoria/
32 (AV/32) with F48 strains was 94.3%, 93.7% and
94.4% respectively. In previous studies, early lineage
viruses AV/32 (genotype III) and Herts/33 (genotype
IV) have been positioned as the possible progenitor of
recent virulent strains according to the sequence and
phylogenetic analysis based on the HN, M-F, M, P and
L gene sequences respectively and also their early date
of isolation [32-36]. Results in this study indicated that
F48-like viruses (genotype IX) invariably shared the closest homology with AV/32 viruses and displayed the
genome size of 15192-nt.
Secondly, F48 which was isolated from an ND outbreak in Northern China in 1946 [22] is the earliest
NDV isolate known to have the 6-nt insert in the 5’NCR of NP gene, which suggested that NDV strains
with 15,192-nt genome size emerged as early as 1940 s,
rather than 1960 s when genotype V strains came out.
The recent genotypes V-VIII strains, as early as they
were first isolated, have displayed wide genetic distances

and geographical distributions, which is indicative of a
long period of evolution prior to the emergence of the
recent viruses. On the other hand, the insertion of a 6nt motif is an rare event in NDV evolution in view of
the extremely low probability of nucleotide addition or
deletion in the genome RNA of Paramyxoviruses
[37,38]. Thus, it was most possible that genotype IX
NDV was the common origin of genotype V-VIII.
Thirdly, it is noteworthy that all the recent viruses are
virulent and their HN protein is exclusively 571 amino
acids long, suggesting that their common progenitor
must possess those genetic characteristics. As described
below, genotype IX displayed the F protein cleavage site
motif of 112 RRQRR↓F 117 and a HN protein of 571
amino acids.
At last, the GC content of the full-length and partial
genome of Newcastle disease virus was compared in this
study (table 2). It was noted that most region of genomic sequences of all class II NDV strains shared similar
GC content, however, the 5’ NCR of NP gene, where
the 6-nt insert was found, showed significant difference
in GC content. All the viruses with 15,192-nt genome
displayed more than 60% GC content, while that of
most 15,186-nt genome strains were no than 50% in
this region. Interestingly, F48-like viruses showed high
GC content in the 5’ NCR of NP gene, the same as that
of recent genotypes, suggesting the relationship between
genotype IX and IV-VIII.
Moreover, the significance of 6-nt insert in NP gene
for NDV has never been explored. A phenomenon has
been observed in this study: genotype IX viruses were
isolated ranging from 1940 s to 2000 s; In comparison,
the early genotype III viruses such as AV/32 from Australia, Miyadera/51 and Sato/30 from Japan and Mukteswar from India are prevalent in Australia and Asia
during the first pandemic of ND before 1960 but no
longer detected thereafter with the exception of Mukteswar which is used as a vaccine virus in some Asian

countries[39]. Therefore, two different kinds of early
genotypes NDVs, one with the genome size of 15,186-nt
and the other with the genome size of 15,192 nt, exist
simultaneously between 1940 s and 1960, while the former one is the predominant. In contrast, the recent genotypes V-IX viruses with genome size of 15,192-nt have
emerged and predominated while early genotypes III
and IV viruses have disappeared since 1960 s. It seems
that NDVs with the insertion of 6-nt motif in the
5’NCR of NP gene might gain certain survive advantage
in selective pressure of the ever-changing ecology.

Conclusion
Results in this study indicated that F48-like viruses are
transitional class II NDVs with early-genotype phylogenetic position and recent-genotype genome size of
15,192-nt, which makes them to be a separate genogroup, genotype IX; genotype IX viruses most likely originate from an early genotype III virus by the insertion
of a 6-nt motif in the 5’-NCR of the NP gene, and
recent V-VIII genotypes may come from genotype IX
viruses, or evolve directly from genotype III or IV
viruses in the same way; and this insertion is an important event in NDV evolution which had occurred as
early as in 1940 s.
Materials and methods
Viruses

NDV strains for entire genome sequence analysis in this
study are as follows: F48E8 (the 8th egg-passaged stock
of F48) was isolated from chicken outbreak in Northern
China in 1946 [22]; FJ/1/85/Ch, ZJ/1/86/Ch, and JS/1/
97/Ch were isolated from chickens in Eastern China in
1985, 1986 and 1997 respectively; strain JS/1/02/Du was
isolated from a healthy duck in our laboratory in 2002
[21]. All the five strains have been characterized as virulent NDVs and assigned to genotype IX previously
(detailed data see Table 3). They were grown in 10-dayold embryonated specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken
eggs and the allantoic fluids were harvested and stored
in -70°C until use.

Polymerase with GC-rich buffer (Takara Biotechnology,
Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The annealing temperature was 62°C.
Amplification of the 3’- and 5’-ends of the viral genome

3’- and 5’- ends of the viral genomes were obtained by
rapid amplification of cDNA end (RACE) as reported
elsewhere [40]. 3’-RACE was carried out by genomic
RNA ligation with 5’ end phosphated adaptor CL+ (5’CGC CAG GGT TTT CCC AGT CAC GAC-3’). Our
protocols are as follows: viral RNA, 25 pmol of CL+, 2.5
μl of 10×T4 RNA ligase buffer, 1 μl of 10 mM ATP, 2.5
μl of 1 mg/ml BSA, 20 U of RNasin (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China), 30 U of T4 RNA ligase (Fermentas,
Shenzhen, China), and RNase-free water to a final
volume of 25 μl were mixed and incubated at 4°C for 18
h. Then the enzyme was denatured at 75°C for 15 min,
and the ligated products were precipitated by ethanol
and dissolved in 20 μl RNase-free water. A 5 μl aliquot
was taken out to make cDNA with anti-adaptor CL-,
which was complementary to adaptor primer CL+. The
reaction was conducted with Mo-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR was carried out
with CL- as the forward primer, while the reverse primer 3TSR (5’-GAG AGA TAT GAG AGC ACC TTG
TCT GAG T-3’) was specific for NP gene of the virus.
For the 5’-RACE, the first strand cDNA was synthesized by Mo-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega,

Madison, WI) using a specific primer 5TLF, 5’-GTC
CAT TCT GTG CAG AGA GTT TAG TGA G-3’,
which was located from 14,502 nt to 14,527 nt in the
viral genome (mentioned in the direction of 3’ end to
5’ end of genomic RNA). The reaction mixture was
incubated at 42°C for 60 min, and then the cDNA was
treated with an equal volume of 0.6 N NaOH for 20
min at 60°C to hydrolyze the mRNA and denature the
first-strand cDNA. After purification by using PCR
purification kit (Axygen, Union City, CA), the cDNA
was ligated with adaptor CL+ by T4 RNA ligase
according to procedures as described in 3’ RACE. The
resulting adaptor-ligated cDNA was amplified using
primer 5TLF and anti-adaptor primer CL-. Heminested PCR reaction was then conducted using the primer CL- and specific primer 5TSF, 5’-CAA TAC TGG
GTC TCA GAG TCA AAA ATC-3’, which was located
from 14724 nt to 14751 nt in the viral genome (mentioned in the direction of 3’ to 5’ of genomic RNA),
and then 1 μl of 1:100 diluted primary PCR product
was used as template.
Cloning and sequencing of the amplified products

RT-PCR products of overlapping fragments covering
entire genome and GC-rich 5’ NCR of NP gene and RTPCR products by RACE were extracted from agarose
gel, ligated into the TA cloning system (Promega, Madison, WI), then transferred into E. coli DH5a strain. At
least four clones of each segment were sequenced in
both directions using the ABI-3700-based (Applied Biosystems Inc.) fluorescent cycle sequencing technology by

Sangon Biotechnology (Shanghai, China), and then the
correct sequences were determined.
Sequence analysis

Prediction of amino acid sequences, aligment of
sequences and phylogenetic analysis were conducted
using the MegAlign program (Windows 32, MegAlign
4.00) in the Lasergene package (DNASTAR Inc. Madison, WI 53715, USA). The sequences of overlapping
DNA fragments were aligned and compiled into complete genome. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by
using the Lasergene software package and MEGA version 4 (Tamura, Dudley, Nei, and Kumar 2007). Data
and accession numbers of complete genome sequences
of NDV strains in this study were presented in additional file 1 Table S1. Additional F gene sequences used
in Figure 2 were taken from the EMBL/GenBank, the
origins of which were described previously [8].
