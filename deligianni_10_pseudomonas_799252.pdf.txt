Abstract
Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is considered to grow in a biofilm in cystic fibrosis (CF) chronic lung
infections. Bacterial cell motility is one of the main factors that have been connected with P. aeruginosa adherence
to both biotic and abiotic surfaces. In this investigation, we employed molecular and microscopic methods to
determine the presence or absence of motility in P. aeruginosa CF isolates, and statistically correlated this with their
biofilm forming ability in vitro.
Results: Our investigations revealed a wide diversity in the production, architecture and control of biofilm
formation. Of 96 isolates, 49% possessed swimming motility, 27% twitching and 52% swarming motility, while 47%
were non-motile. Microtitre plate assays for biofilm formation showed a range of biofilm formation ability from
biofilm deficient phenotypes to those that formed very thick biofilms. A comparison of the motility and adherence
properties of individual strains demonstrated that the presence of swimming and twitching motility positively
affected biofilm biomass. Crucially, however, motility was not an absolute requirement for biofilm formation, as 30
non-motile isolates actually formed thick biofilms, and three motile isolates that had both flagella and type IV pili
attached only weakly. In addition, CLSM analysis showed that biofilm-forming strains of P. aeruginosa were in fact
capable of entrapping non-biofilm forming strains, such that these ‘non-biofilm forming’ cells could be observed as
part of the mature biofilm architecture.
Conclusions: Clinical isolates that do not produce biofilms in the laboratory must have the ability to survive in the
patient lung. We propose that a synergy exists between isolates in vivo, which allows “non biofilm-forming” isolates
to be incorporated into the biofilm. Therefore, there is the potential for strains that are apparently non-biofilm
forming in vitro to participate in biofilm-mediated pathogenesis in the CF lung.

Background
A biofilm is defined as a bacterial population in which
the cells adhere to each other and to surfaces or interfaces with architectural complexity [1]. The role of biofilms in many infectious diseases including urinary tract
infections [2], periodontitis [3], ophthalmic infections [4],
and chronic diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) [5], has
been demonstrated and they are thus of clinical concern.
Biofilms exhibit increased resistance to antimicrobial
agents, due to production of extracellular polymeric

substances, high concentrations in the biofilm of
enzymes such as b-lactamases due to higher cell density,
slower cellular metabolic rates as a response to nutrient
limitation and the presence of persistent cells [3,6-8].
The bacterial pathogen P. aeruginosa is capable of
adhering to a variety of epithelial cells and this is
believed to be the critical step in colonisation of the
lung in CF. When sputum samples from CF patients
were examined, P. aeruginosa predominated in aggregates, being encased in the characteristic extracellular
matrix of biofilm thriving bacteria [9-11]. The earlyinfecting P. aeruginosa strains of the CF lung typically
resemble those found in the environment, being nonmucoid, fast growing and relatively susceptible to

antibiotics [12]. During chronic infection, however, the
bacteria acclimatise to the airway environment of the
CF patient via considerable genetic adaptation and the
accumulation of loss-of-function mutations. Mutation in
the mucA gene, for example, causes a transition from
the non-mucoid to the mucoid, alginate-overproducing
phenotype [13]. Other phenotypic changes include the
loss of flagella or pilus mediated motility, the loss of Oantigen components of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS),
appearance of auxotrophic variants and loss of pyocyanin production, as well as the emergence of multiply
antibiotic resistant strains [8,11,14-16]. This phenotypic
transition during chronic infection probably reflects an
adaptive behaviour that enables the P. aeruginosa isolates to survive in the hostile environment of the CF
lung [17-19].
Various studies have addressed the importance of bacterial motility, both as a means of initiating contact with
an abiotic surface and in biofilm formation and development [20-22]. P. aeruginosa is capable of three types of
motility. Twitching motility is mediated by type IV pili
on solid substrates [12], whilst swimming motility and
swarming motility are both mediated by the flagellum in
aqueous environments. A switch from swimming to
swarming motility is believed to occur in semisolid
environments (e.g. agar or mucus) [23]. Flagellamediated motility serves to bring cells into close proximity with surfaces thereby overcoming repulsive forces
between the bacterium and the surface to which it will
attach [24]. It has been suggested that the flagellum also
plays a direct role as an adhesin [14] and indeed Sauer
et al. [16,25], observed a significant decrease in attachment efficiency in non-flagellated P. aeruginosa mutants
compared to the wild type. Twitching motility is a form
of surface translocation that is mediated by type IV pili,
which are involved in biofilm architecture and are
responsible for the formation of microcolonies in biofilms [15,21,26].
It has been hypothesised that biofilm formation initially requires flagella-dependent association and binding
to a surface to allow formation of a single cell monolayer. Individual cells of this monolayer then conglomerate into a number of microcolonies through twitching
motility via type IV pili. Once attached and manifesting
twitching motility, P. aeruginosa can then form fully
mature biofilm structures [8,21]. Notably, cell motility
varies during the different developmental stages and
ceases after irreversible attachment, implying the loss of
flagella in biofilm bacteria [16], a theory supported by
microarray analyses that showed that flagella and type
IV pili genes were downregulated in biofilm cells compared to planktonic cells [27]. In contrast, Klausen et al.
[28] reported that flagella and type IV pili were not
necessary for initial attachment or biofilm formation,

but they did have roles in shaping P. aeruginosa biofilms: whilst both wild type PAO1 and flagella - /pili mutants formed undifferentiated biofilms consisting of
small microcolonies in the initial stages, the mature biofilms were structurally very different.
It is clear, therefore, that there is a large amount of
information about the role of motility in biofilm development, but its contribution to the infection process is
not fully clarified. However the adaptations that bacteria
undergo in the CF environment are likely to induce
alterations in the biofilm phenotype. In the present
work, RAPD profiling was coupled with biofilm formation and motility studies in vitro to gain insight into
how motility might be correlated with single or multistrain biofilm formation in CF isolates.

Methods
Chemicals

All chemicals, of analar grade or better were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., Poole, UK, unless
otherwise stated. All agars and broths were obtained
from Oxoid, UK, except where stated.
Bacterial isolates

Ninety-six Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were cultured from sputum samples taken from 13 children
known to be infected only with P. aeruginosa, who were
attending the CF clinic in Belfast City Hospital, N. Ireland at the same time (Andrienne Shaw, pers. Comm.
2003). Isolates were chosen based on their colony morphology on Pseudomonas isolation agar. All isolates
were initially confirmed as P. aeruginosa using both the
API20 NE identification system (BioMerieux, France)
and by subsequent amplification of the P. aeruginosaspecific OprL gene [17]. Isolates were deemed mucoid
or non-mucoid by visual inspection on agar and the collection was stored at -70°C on Protect cryobeads (Technical Service Consultants, Heywood, U.K.).
Arbitrarily primed-PCR (AP-PCR)

Genotyping of the P. aeruginosa collection used two
arbitrary primers, 10514 and 14306 (Table 1), as
described by Kersulyte et al. [29]. Phylogenetic trees
were constructed using the Gelcompar II software
(Applied Maths BVVBA, Keistraat 120, 9830 Saint-Martens-Latem, Belgium). The cluster algorithm used was
UPGMA and DICE with an optimisation value of 0.5%
and a tolerance of 1%. Gelcompar II software was used
to generate profiles.
Motility assays

agarose (BDH Ltd., UK) using a sterile toothpick. The
swimming zones were measured after 48 h incubation at
37°C. Swimming motility was also confirmed by light
microscopy.
(ii) swarming

The medium used for this assay consisted of 0.5% Nutrient broth, 5 g l-1 glucose and 0.5% Bacto-Agar (Difco).
Plates for swarming motility assays were inoculated with
a 5 μl aliquot from an overnight culture in LB broth,
onto the top of the agar and incubated at 37°C for 48 h.
(iii) twitching

The plates for twitching motility contained LB broth
solidified with 1.2% bacteriological agar. The plates were
stab inoculated with a sharp toothpick to the bottom of
a Petri dish from an overnight culture grown on LB
Agar at 37°C. The plates were incubated at 37°C overnight and the clear zone at the agar/Petri dish interface
was measured as per Harunur-Rashid and Kornberg [30]
followed by staining with coomassie brilliant blue G250
(0.5% (w/v) in 25% (v/v) isopropanol/10% (v/v) acetic
acid) for 30 min to increase contrast. All motility assays
were performed in triplicate.
Detection of pilA and fliC genes was confirmed as
described by Kus et al. [31] with modifications in the primers as shown in Table 1. PilA genes of isolates 1, 40 and
48 were amplified with the primer set pilB2 and tRNAThr,
and for isolate 72, the primer set pilA and tRNAThr. FilC

genes of isolates 1 and 72 were amplified with primers
fliCFor3 and fliCRev2 [32], and for isolates 40, 41 and 48
the primer set fliCFor2 and fliCRev2. The resultant amplicons were ligated into a pT7Blue-2 cloning vector and
transformed into NovaBlue Singles using a Perfectly Blunt
Cloning Kit (Novagen). Plasmid DNA was extracted from
broth cultures using a Rapid Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Qiagen) and the inserts sequenced. Primers SeqU19, SeqT7
and pre-pilA were used in the sequencing of all cloned
pilA genes. In addition, clones from isolates 1, 40 and 48
required use of primer pilB2 while isolate 72 required the
primer pilA. Primers SeqT7 and SeqU19 were used to
sequence the cloned fliC genes from all four isolates. The
sequences for isolates 1, 40, 41 and 48 have been deposited
in GenBank. For the fliC gene the accession numbers are
EF418192, EF418193, EF418194, and EF418195 respectively while for the pilA gene EF418188, EF418189,
EF418190 and EF418191, respectively).
Gfp tagging of P. aeruginosa isolates was carried out
by mobilising the pBK-miniTn7-gfp3 and pUX-BF13
plasmids (Table 2) as per Koch et al. [13]. Insertion was
confirmed by PCR using transrev/transfor primers
(Table 1) giving a 150 bp amplicon.
Microtitre plate assay for assessment of biofilm formation

P. aeruginosa strains were grown to an attenuance (D600
of 0.5 and diluted 100-fold with LB broth following

which 100 μl aliquots were dispensed into triplicate
microtitre plates which were incubated at 37°C. Three
plates were sacrificed for analysis every 4 h and attenuance was measured at 600 nm with a BioTek FL600
microtitre plate reader against uninoculated LB broth;
means and standard deviations were calculated. Biofilms
were stained with 1% crystal violet, washed with deionised water and quantitated by adding 95% ethanol followed by measurement of the absorbance (OD 595 nm)
as per Stepanovic et al. [33]. Strains with no change in
O.D over the control were classified non-biofilm producers, weak- (up to a 2 fold change), moderate- (up to 4
fold change) or strong- (greater than 4 fold change) as
per Strepanovic et al. [33] All tests were carried out in
triplicate and the results were averaged. P. aeruginosa
strain PAO1 was included as a positive control.
Biofilms in a capillary flow reactor were grown in
glass capillary tubes of square cross sections under continuous flow conditions. The capillaries had a nominal
inside dimension of 900 μm and a wall thickness of 170
± 10 μm (Friedrich & Dimmock, Millville, N.J., USA).
The flow cell apparatus consisted of a vented medium
feed carboy (four litre capacity), a flow break, a filtered
air entry, a peristaltic pump (Watson-Marlow), the
capillary and flow cell holder, an inoculation port, and a
waste carboy. The components were connected by silicone rubber tubing and were sterilised by autoclaving.
A culture of gfp-P. aeruginosa was grown in LB overnight at 37°C in a shaking incubator at 140 rpm. A 100
μl aliquot of this culture was used to inoculate 10 ml of
sterile LB broth in a 250 ml conical flask to achieve
good aeration and the culture was grown at 37°C with
shaking at 200 rpm for 3 h. The tubing was clamped
downstream of the inoculation port and the capillary
flow system was inoculated with 300 μl of this fresh culture. The tubing was then clamped upstream of the
glass tube and the system was allowed to stand without
a flow for 19 h to allow the cells to attach to the glass
capillary at 37°C. After initial attachment, the flow of
medium (1/10 strength LB, to avoid blockage of the

capillary due to excessive biomass production) was
adjusted to a flow rate of 20 ml h-1.
Bacterial staining of mixed biofilms consisting of
biofilm+ and biofilm- isolates, were stained with 300 μl
of a 5 mg l-1 rhodamine B (Kodak) solution in water.
The stain solution was injected into the capillary reactor
through the inoculation port and the cells allowed to
stain for 5 min. Biofilms were subsequently observed by
confocal scanning laser microscopy with excitation and
emission wavelengths of 540 nm at 625 nm respectively
for rhodamine B and 475 nm and 510 for GFP.
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)

Prior to SEM, samples were chemically fixed as follows:
A 10 μl aliquot of an overnight culture, grown in LB
broth at 37°C, with shaking at 140 rpm was placed in a
round glass coverslip (10 mm diameter, Chance Proper
Ltd., UK) with a 10 μl of fixative (3% glutaraldehyde in
0.1% sodium cacodylate, pH 7.3). The coverslips were
previously coated with polylysine (Sigma-Aldrich) to
assist adherence of bacterial cells. The cells were
allowed to fix for 10 min following which the supernatant was discarded and excess fixative was added to the
coverslip for 5 min followed by a final washing step
with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, pH 7.3. In order to dehydrate the bacteria the coverslips were successively placed
for 10 min in each one of the following solutions: 30%,
50%, 70%, 90%, and 100% (twice) (v/v) acetone. The
coverslips were then dried with a critical point drier and
sputter coated with Au: Pt, 60:40 in argon (Polarow
E5100). The slides were visualized with a JSM 840 SEM
(JEOL Ltd., Herts, UK).
Light and Epifluorescence microscopy examination of
P. aeruginosa cells was performed using a Nikon Eclipse
E800 microscope equipped with 40 × and 60 × water
objectives, differential interference contrast (DIC) polarizing filters and reflectance optics. For epifluorescence
microscopy, the microscope was equipped with a 100 W
Hg-vapour discharge lamp and fluorescent images were
obtained using the following filters: B-2A blue excitation

filter with excitation wavelength 470-490 nm, (Nikon)
and a Red excitation filter: Cy5 HYQ (Nikon). Images
were captured by a Micromax RTE/CCD-732-7 (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ, USA) camera and MetaVue 5.0 software (Universal Imaging Co., Downingtown,
PA, USA).
CLSM and image analysis

Glass capillary flow reactors were inoculated with the
GFP-P. aeruginosa isolates and biofilms in capillary flow
reactors were observed using 40 × magnification lenses
with a CLSM (Leica TCS-NT). CSLM image analysis
software was Image Pro Plus, Version 3.00.00 (Media
Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA). Microscope images
were analyzed by use of the line scan fiction of Metamorph image analysis software (Universal Imaging Co.,
Downingtown, PA, USA). For the depth profile, the
interface between the biofilm and the glass wall was set
to zero on a spatial axis. Stimulated fluorescence projections and vertical cross sections through the bacterial
biofilms were generated with IMARIS (Bitplane AG)
software package running on a Silicon Graphics Indigo
2 workstation.
Statistical analysis was performed in order to validate
the effect of motility in P. aeruginosa biofilms. The isolates were divided into four groups based on their motility patterns: the first group (C1) consisted of isolates
that both swim and twitch, the second (C2) of immotile
isolates, the third (C3) of isolates that swim but do not
twitch and the forth (C4) of isolates that twitch but do
not swim. A one-way ANOVA was performed to test
the null hypothesis that there were no differences in the
mean motility of the four groups, followed by a Tukey’s
post-hoc to compare the individual groups’ differences.
Tukey’s post-hoc calculates a 95%-confidence interval
for the mean of each group and then substracts the
means pair-wise i.e. C1 minus C2, C1 minus C3 etc. If
the differences include 0 then the means are not significantly different. The results were verified by performing
a two sample Ttest within pairs of groups and the
obtained p-values for multiple testing corrected using
Bonferroni correction. MiniTab was used for the statistical analysis.
Statement of Ethical Approval

Health and Personal Social Services (HPSS) (Northern
Ireland) REC 2, Reference No. 07/NIR02/39.

Results
We examined a set of 96 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa for their ability to produce biofilm in
vitro and we determined the relationship of bacterial
motility to biofilm production within the set.

Diversity in biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa CF isolates

We examined biofilm-forming ability in 96 well microtitre
plates. Biofilm growth was observed as a ring of crystal
violet-stained material formed at the air-liquid interface.
We observed a wide variation in the quantity of biofilm
biomass amongst the isolates tested (Table 3, column 3-5).
A total of 31 isolates were characterised by weak adherence, 19 isolates by moderate adherence and 46 by strong
adherence (A595 nm > 0.3). Among the strongly adherent
isolates, differing levels of adherence were also observed,
with A595 nm values ranging from 0.3-2.0. Neither the
quantity of planktonic cell biomass produced in these cultures, nor the growth rate of the isolates, was correlated
with the quantity of biofilm biomass produced: bacteria
with doubling times of either 1 h or 5 h could both produce the same quantity of biofilm. Biofilm formation
amongst the isolates also differed in the time of initial
adhesion, with some isolates showing strong adherence
whilst the planktonic bacterial population was still in the
lag phase and the cell density low, while for others, adhesion commenced only when the planktonic culture was in
the mid exponential phase (data not shown). A whole cell
protein determination [34] carried out concomitantly with
D600 nm measurements, confirmed that attenuance values
were indeed due to planktonic cells and not due to alginate produced by them.
In order to visualise the differences in attachment
between strong and weak biofilm forming isolates, bacterial cells were allowed to attach to glass coverslips and
subsequently visualized using SEM. Coverslips were
immersed vertically in an inoculated culture and two
coverslips were removed and fixed for SEM visualization
at intervals. Diversity in isolate attachment onto the
glass cover slip was observed, with the moderate and
strongly adhering isolates from the microplate assay
forming clumps of cells (e.g. isolate 17; Fig. 1a). Weakly
adherent isolates attached as individual cells (e.g. isolate
80; Fig. 1b) however as both types of biofilm matured,
the spaces between the clumps were filled with a cell
lawn (Fig. 1c &1d).
Isolates previously characterised as weakly adherent
did not form the characteristic biofilm structures, and
we observed that relatively few cells were attached to
the glass substrate and that biofilm formation was
initiated only after the surrounding planktonic culture
had reached stationary phase. At this point the cells
were elongated, reaching up to 15 μm in length - a
potential response to nutrient limitation also observed
by other researchers.

isolate motility. Swimming motility was initially observed
for 48 isolates (50%) with a migration zone of 7 - 40 mm
(Table 3, column 7). Twitching motility was distinguished by the presence of an interstitial twitch zone
formed by colony expansion. Isolates exhibiting twitching
motility (Table 3, column 6) formed flat spreading colonies with a characteristic “rough” appearance and a
twitching zone consisting of a very thin layer of cells
observed as a halo around the colony. Isolates incapable
of twitching formed small, smooth, flat colonies on the
agar surface that remained at the inoculation point. Coomassie staining revealed a series of concentric rings in
the twitching zone. When P. aeruginosa isolates were
inoculated onto the surface of agar to assay swarming
motility, 36 (37%) of the isolates (Table 3, column 8)
formed characteristic swarming patterns consisting of
branches or tentacles radiating from the inoculation
point. Movement across the agar surface was rapid, with
bacteria having colonised the entire surface of the plate
within several hours after inoculation. A lack of twitching
motility was not matched by an absence of swarming
motility, but did seem to influence the pattern of colony
translocation. When twitching motility was present, the

swarm edge exhibited a higher bacterial cell concentration than the centre, while in non-twitching isolates, bacterial colonies were denser in the centre and surrounded
by a thin film of translocated bacteria. Of the 96 isolates,
a number of strains overlapped in terms of motility phenotype: 24 had flagellar and twitching motility, 27 had
only twitching motility, 47 had only swarming motility
and a total of 45 were non motile.
Given the complex phenotypic diversity of the clinical
isolates based on direct observations we recognized the
need for a rational approach to selecting the most
appropriate isolates for further study. We adopted
RAPD as a convenient and quick genotyping method
that allowed us to characterise the heterogeneity in the
group, using a cut off value of 85% similarity as a
threshold to compare strains. Primer 10514 generated a
total of 22 different profiles (Table 3), fifteen of which
contained more than one isolate. Primer 10514-generated profiles were cross- referenced with those of primer
14306 and showed that similar profiles were generated
with both primers.
We noted variations in surface attachment ability and
in motility among strains and we selected strains based

aeruginosa isolates formed a monolayer (B and D; isolate 80) while the moderate and strongly adherent isolates formed clumps of cells (A and
C; isolate 17) when biofilms were grown on glass cover slips. Microbial attachment first presented as clumps of cells (A and B; 7 and 14 h

upon both genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, i.e.
strains that represented similar RAPD groupings and
also based upon the degree of biofilm production.
Twenty genotypically distinct isolates were thus selected
for further study (Table 4, column1).
P. aeruginosa CF isolates exhibit a lack of correlation
between motility phenotype and genotype

The observed phenotypic differences in twitching motility led us to consider whether non-twitching isolates
were inherently non-motile or whether they possessed
the capability to be motile but did not express it. Pilin
alleles and associated gene(s) are located in a common
chromosomal locus between the conserved pilB and
tRNAThr genes [18]. The presence of various tfp accessory genes located upstream of pilA determines

amplicon size, thus allowing the delineation of five TFP
groups [18,31]. Seven twitching efficient and 13 twitching deficient isolates were selected (Table 4) and we
determined whether or not pilA, the type IV pilus (TFP)
gene responsible for the PilA structural protein, was
present in the isolates.
Thirteen isolates yielded ~2.8 kbp amplicons with the
pilB and tRNAThr primers [31], thus the majority of the
CF isolates fell into TFP group I (tfpO). Amplicons of
~1.4 kb were produced with the same pilB and tRNAThr
primer set from isolates 1, 3 and 64 placing them in
TFP group II (tfpY). Six other primer combinations
were tried with isolates 41, 54, 55 and 72, however a
pilA amplicon was generated only from isolate 72 using
primers pilA and tRNAThr, showing that it belonged to
TFP group V (tfpZ). Of the 17 isolates for which pilA

contrast however, isolates 5, 6, and 61 (motile) exhibited
very poor adhesion in microtitre plates. For the statistical analysis we started with the null hypothesis that
motility does not affect biofilm formation and performed a one-way ANOVA that gave an F-value of 9.88,
allowing rejection of the null hypothesis. At this point
we could not say between which groups the difference
was so we performed a Tukey’s post-hoc test between
all the possible group pairs. Group C1, as it was termed
for the analysis, contained the highest percentage of
strong biofilm forming isolates - 80% - while in groups
C2 and C3 the percentage of strong biofilm forming isolates was only 40% and 33%, respectively (Fig. 2). The
results revealed that C1 was different from C2, C3 and
C4 but there was no difference among the C2, C3 and
C4. The same conclusion was reached using a Ttest
with correction for multiple testing. We concluded
therefore that the combination of swimming and twitching motility has a positive contribution to biofilm biomass but is not absolutely necessary for the initiation of
the process.

Having shown statistically that the isolates possessing
both twitching and swimming motility produced greater
biofilm biomass we set out to investigate the architecture of biofilms produced by members of this group.
We gfp tagged 5 isolates exhibiting different motility/
biofilm biomass combinations: 17 and 40 (twitch+, swim

presence was confirmed only 7 (41%) actually exhibited
twitching motility, demonstrating that the presence of
pilA alone does not secure motility. Representative
amplicons were cloned and sequenced and subsequent
alignments confirmed their categorisation into the
groups described by Kus et al. [31]. The fliC structural
gene was also detected in all 20 isolates (Table 4), however its presence, like that of pilA, did not guarantee
swimming motility as 9 isolates (45%) did not swim.
The presence of flagella in isolates was verified with
SEM, while full length DNA sequences were obtained
for fliC of isolates 1, 40, 41 (motile) and 48 (non
motile).
Statistical analysis shows that motility contributes to
biofilm thickness but not to biofilm formation in our
isolates

It has been reported in a number of studies
[16,25,35,36] that motility is required for biofilm formation, whereas in contrast, Klausen et al. [28] reported
that mutants deficient in pili and flagella showed no significant differences from wild type. In the current study,
biofilm formation was not influenced by the presence of
either flagella or type IV pili, since 45 isolates that
formed either moderate or strong biofilms were deficient in twitching, swimming, and swarming motility. In

Figure 2 Box-and-whiskers plots showing the impact of
flagella/TFP on the biofilm. P. aeruginosa isolates placed in four
groups based on their motility properties. Based on the presence of
flagella/TFP the groups were named as C1 (+/+), C2 (-/-), C3 (+/-),
C4 (-/+). One-way ANOVA reveals a significant difference (P < 0.001)
between the groups with respect to CV absorbance. (This difference
can also be observed when the three outliers, marked by stars, in
group C2 and the two outliers in group C3 are discarded from the
analysis.) Tukey’s post-hoc test revealed that the presence of both
flagella/pili (group C1) contributes to a significantly higher biofilm
biomass (as compared to groups C2-C4).

(twitch-, swim-, biofilm+). The resulting gfp-tagged isolates had growth rates identical to those of the parental
strains (data not shown). P. aeruginosa ATCC15442 was
used as a control to ensure that reactor did not influence biofilm morphology and following staining with
Syto9 and propidium iodide, characteristic mushroomshaped biofilms of P. aeruginosa ATCC15442 were
observed in a number of different reactors. Spatial biofilm distribution in the tagged strains was measured
over time in a glass capillary flow reactor and images
were acquired with CLSM at regular 12 h intervals at
random positions in the flow chambers. Visual inspection revealed that the biofilm architecture of the P. aeruginosa CF isolates was significantly different from that
of the ATCC control strain (Fig. 3). Among the isolates
tested, 17, 40 and 41 gave biofilm growth while isolates

55 and 80 did not attach to the glass capillary. Isolates
were observed as microcolonies on day 1 and formed a
biofilm within 48 h of inoculation. They continued to
grow until the 7th day with a maximum thickness of 75
μm for isolates 17 and 40 and 145 μm for isolate 41.
Isolate 17 formed a mushroom-shaped biofilm that
appeared after 48 h of growth, while isolate 40 formed a
flat biofilm with small hilly structures spatially distributed. The biofilm formed by isolate 41, was flat and was
the thickest among the isolates. Although stains 55 and
80 showed weak attachment to microtitre dish wells,
other than a transient superficial attachment at seven
hours no attachment was observed from 12 hours
onward in the glass capillary flow reactor. We observed
that cell attachment proceeding to biofilm formation
was dependent upon the attachment substrate.

Entrapment of non-biofilm forming P. aeruginosa isolates
by an already established biofilm

We wished to test the hypothesis that the diversity of
isolates derived from clinical samples is due to non-biofilm producing isolates interacting with biofilm producers. Glass capillary flow reactors were inoculated with
the GFP-P. aeruginosa 17 isolate and the biofilm formation was followed with CLSM. Following 48 h growth,
the capillary reactor was inoculated with isolate 80 and
the flow was stopped for 3 h to allow attachment. The
bacterial biofilms were stained with rhodamine B (reference colour) and observed with CLSM 24 h after inoculation with isolate 80 (Fig. 4). Isolate gfp-17 was
identified by green fluorescence due to the production
of GFP, and isolate 80 was identified by rhodamine B.
The excitation and emission wavelengths were distant
between the fluorophores and did not overlap. Isolate
gfp-17 established a green lawn that colonised the reactor surface, while isolate 80 was observed as spatially

Page 10 of 13

distributed red cell clumps within the established biofilm. Furthermore, cross sectional analysis of the biofilm
(Fig. 5) showed that isolate 80 was not only attached to
the surface of the isolate 17 biofilm, but that the cells
were incorporated into the three dimensional structure
of the established biofilm, suggesting that isolate 80 was
able to migrate into the established biofim despite its
lack of twitching and swimming motility.

Discussion
The CF lung can be colonised by P. aeruginosa isolates
that display heterogeneity in both motility and biofilm
phenotype. We evaluated the association between types
of motility and biofilm formation using a set of 96 clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. Several studies have
reported that motility is required to initiate cell attachment [8,37-39] although there is still no consensus as to
the contribution of each type of motility to the overall
process of biofilm development. While P. aeruginosa is

capillary flow reactor. Isolate gfp-17 was allowed to establish a biofilm for 48 h and then isolate 80 was inoculated into the flow reactor. After
24 h incubation the mixed biofilm was stained and GFP and rhodamine B were excited at 488 nm and 567 nm respectively.

isolate 80 was inoculated into the flow reactor. After 24 h incubation the mixed biofilm was stained and GFP and rhodamine B were excited at

a motile bacterium, the lack of motility in CF isolates
has been previously reported [15] and here some 47% of
the isolates were non-motile. Nonetheless, motility was
not a key factor for the initiation of initial attachment in
vitro, but when the motility phenotype was present,
there was a notable increase in biofilm biomass similar
to that observed by Head and Yu [40].
We were particularly interested in the role of Type
IV pili in biofilm formation and we noted that our isolates had a broadly similar distribution of pilin types to
that described by Klausen et al. [28], with no particular
bias towards any TFP group for motile and non-motile
isolates (Table 4). Some 65% of the isolates had Group
I pilins, and although this group contained both motile
and non-motile strains, we did however note a high
degree of sequence diversity (data not shown), which
could explain our observation that only 59% of pilA +
isolates actually showed a twitching motility
phenotype.
It is generally accepted that flagella are required for P.
aeruginosa swimming and swarming motility [21,41].
We therefore deployed a combination of molecular and
microscopic techniques to examine our selected isolates.

As documented in the literature, however, the presence
and expression of fliC was not enough to guarantee
swimming motility [38,41,42], and our confirmation by
SEM that certain non-swimming isolates possessed flagella leads to the hypothesis that other molecules must
be involved in the initial colonisation of a surface by
bacteria. Indeed, a recent study of Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm identified a surface-associated autolysin
that possessed bacteriolytic and adhesive properties [43]
and it is possible that similar adhesins may play an
important role in the initial attachment of P. aeruginosa
to surfaces.
Differences in biofilm structure have been connected
with the role of type IV pili and flagella [44] and in
addition to diversity in biofilm biomass, we too observed
variations in biofilm morphology amongst our isolates.
Of the five isolates we investigated in vitro, only one
formed the expected mushroom architecture, two failed
to form a biofilm on the capillary (and were also only
weakly attached in microtitre plate assays), one formed
a thick lawn and one produced a thin lawn with hillocks. It is clear therefore that biofilm morphology and
architecture are very isolate specific.

Deligianni et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:38

Bacterial immigration along a surface may be type IV
pilus-driven [21] or flagellum-driven [22]. Klausen et al.
[44] and Barken et al. [45] identified flat biofilm structures of both the parent PAO1 and the flagellum deficient mutant ΔfliM-PAO1, whilst the pilus deficient
mutant ΔpilA-PAO1 formed hilly structures, suggesting
that cell migration within the biofilm was the result of
the type IV pili-driven motility. In contrast our experiments showed that twitching positive isolates produced
a mushroom shaped biofilm or hillocks, whilst twitching
negative isolates produced only thick lawns (Fig. 3).
Such diversity in the production, architecture and control of biofilm formation suggested to us that what we
were measuring in vitro may not represent the true
situation that would be found in vivo. For example, clinical isolates that do not produce biofilms in the laboratory must have the ability to survive in the patient lung,
leading to the hypothesis that a synergy between isolates
in vivo, may allow “non biofilm-forming” isolates to be
incorporated into the biofilm.
Leriche et al. [19] have described the protection of
certain bacterial strains by other strains within a mixed
biofilm system. We therefore investigated the potential
for a “non biofilm-forming” isolate (isolate 80) to be
incorporated into the biofilm produced by isolate 17, a
strong biofilm producer and showed that not only can
an established biofilm of P. aeruginosa assist in the
attachment and colonisation of another isolate, but also
that the two P. aeruginosa isolates became integrated in
a mixed biofilm as shown in cross section CSLM images
(Fig. 5).
In the mixed biofilm scenario in vitro, the CF P. aeruginosa biofilm could consist of many different isolates,
some of which are unable to form biofilms themselves
yet can colonise an already established biofilm. Adaptability is the key to successful colonisation of an environmental niche and in the field of infectious disease, it
is widely accepted that a pathogen will normally have
more than one way of exerting a pathogenic effect.
Many pathogens, therefore, have multiple adhesion
mechanisms allowing attachment to, for example,
epithelial cells [46]. We contend that the physiological
mechanisms involved in biofilm formation should be
considered in a similar manner, in that a deficiency in
one phenotypic aspect of biofilm formation may be
compensated for by other genetic and phenotypic
factors.

Conclusions
Motility makes a positive contribution to biofilm formation in CF isolates of P. aeruginosa, but is not an absolute requirement. It is clear that CF isolates with
differing motility phenotypes can act synergistically to
form a mixed biofilm. This could give an advantage to

Page 12 of 13

bacterial communities as they would possess a greater
repertoire of genetic ability, thus allowing them to adapt
to different challenges e.g. antibiotic chemotherapy, host
inflammatory responses, etc.
