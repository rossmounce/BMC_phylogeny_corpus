Abstract
Background: In the past few years, functional genomics information has been rapidly accumulating
on Rubiaceae species and especially on those belonging to the Coffea genus (coffee trees). An
increasing number of expressed sequence tag (EST) data and EST- or genomic-derived
microsatellite markers have been generated, together with Conserved Ortholog Set (COS)
markers. This considerably facilitates comparative genomics or map-based genetic studies through
the common use of orthologous loci across different species. Similar genomic information is
available for e.g. tomato or potato, members of the Solanaceae family. Since both Rubiaceae and
Solanaceae belong to the Euasterids I (lamiids) integration of information on genetic markers would
be possible and lead to more efficient analyses and discovery of key loci involved in important traits
such as fruit development, quality, and maturation, or adaptation. Our goal was to develop a
comprehensive web data source for integrated information on validated orthologous markers in
Rubiaceae.
Description: MoccaDB is an online MySQL-PHP driven relational database that houses annotated
and/or mapped microsatellite markers in Rubiaceae. In its current release, the database stores 638
markers that have been defined on 259 ESTs and 379 genomic sequences. Marker information was
retrieved from 11 published works, and completed with original data on 132 microsatellite markers
validated in our laboratory. DNA sequences were derived from three Coffea species/hybrids.
Microsatellite markers were checked for similarity, in vitro tested for cross-amplification and
diversity/polymorphism status in up to 38 Rubiaceae species belonging to the Cinchonoideae and
Rubioideae subfamilies. Functional annotation was provided and some markers associated with
described metabolic pathways were also integrated. Users can search the database for marker,
sequence, map or diversity information through multi-option query forms. The retrieved data can

be browsed and downloaded, along with protocols used, using a standard web browser. MoccaDB
also integrates bioinformatics tools (CMap viewer and local BLAST) and hyperlinks to related
external data sources (NCBI GenBank and PubMed, SOL Genomic Network database).
Conclusion: We believe that MoccaDB will be extremely useful for all researchers working in the
areas of comparative and functional genomics and molecular evolution, in general, and population
analysis and association mapping of Rubiaceae and Solanaceae species, in particular.

Background
Accumulation of available genetic markers directly contributes to advances in marker-assisted genetic studies
with a wide range of applications such as detection and
identification of individual genes and/or quantitative trait
loci (QTL), or exploration of the genetic diversity and
population structure with regard to natural variations [13]. The recent and rapid accumulation of sequence
resources, mainly from crop species, ensures an improvement of the genetics approach in combination with the
comparative genomics. The extension of these genome
resources to their close relatives as well as to more distant
genera greatly facilitates the elucidation of evolutionary
histories. This elucidation involves the discovery and
study of key orthologous loci, phylogeny reconstruction
and a variety of other biological questions.
The Rubiaceae family is the fourth largest family of flowering plants but, except for rare species such as Kadua centranthoides Hook. & Arn. [as Hedyotis centranthoides]and
Kadua affinis Cham. & Schltdl. [as Hedyotis terminalis]
(Levesque MP, Twigg RW, Motley T, Katari MS, Dedhia
NN, O'Shaughnessy AL, Balija V, Martienssen RA,
McCombie RW, Benfey P et al: Expressed tag sequences
from Hedyotis centranthoides and Hedyotis terminalis flowers - Stage 2 (NYBG), accessions available from http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov 2003), most of the genomic information has been generated from the major economic crop
species of the Coffea genus, cultivated throughout the
tropics: C. arabica L. and C. canephora Pierre ex A.Froehner, the Arabica and Robusta coffee trees, respectively.
They are thus used as molecular models for the Rubiaceae.
Integrative information of genomic and genetic knowledge acquired for these plants can be further extended to
other Coffea species but also to other economically important Rubiaceae genera used in medicine (e.g. Cinchona,
which produces quinine, is used as a cure for malaria),
and in horticulture (e.g. many genera, including Gardenia,
Ixora, Pentas, Mussaenda and Sherardia, are well known
ornamentals [4]).
Among PCR-amplified markers, microsatellite (or simple
sequence repeat, SSR) markers are commonly used in
large-scale genomic studies owing to their ubiquitous distribution in both protein-coding and non-coding regions
and the high degree of length polymorphism among indi-

viduals [5]. The C. canephora microsatellites were screened
in a leaf and fruit EST database [2] and in a C. canephora
BAC sequence [6]. The overall SSR density has been estimated as one SSR every 7.73 kb and one SSR every 4.1 kb,
in the ESTs and in the genomic sequences, respectively
[2,6]. However, although microsatellites are distributed
ubiquitously throughout the Coffea genome, only a few of
them are suitable for designing informative markers with
properties such as strong and specific amplified fragment
after PCR and easy scoring of allele sizes, high heterozygosity and/or known position along a linkage map.
Functional genomics is particularly promising for identifying genes involved in a variety of biological functions,
which include pathways related to the coffee beverage
quality such as synthesis of caffeine, sugars, lipids and
chlorogenic acids, but also those related to fruit development. The use of markers directly targeting expressed
genes important for each specific trait would be beneficial
to these studies. Due to the ongoing sequencing of
expressed genes from different plant organs, it is now possible to develop EST-SSR markers for important traits, like
fruit properties.
Previous publications [1,2,7,8] and the present study have
revealed that coffee EST-SSR and SSR markers show a high
level of transferability across distantly related species,
thereby providing additional markers for orphan
Rubiaceae species.
Although the genomic data available on coffee plants are
rapidly increasing, they are often isolated and scattered
and rarely available online. In the present study, an effort
has been made to create a centralized access to both published and original new data on evolutionarily conserved
and validated markers. Integrated comprehensive information system and bioinformatics tools are provided,
which will be useful for the research community working
on plant genetics and evolution of coffee tree related
organisms.

Construction and content
Data source
The data retrieval and compilation for MoccaDB has
involved the following steps: (1) extraction of data from
various sources (publications, public databases etc.); (2)
Page 2 of 11
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:123

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/123

development and testing of additional new markers in
Rubiaceae species; (3) compilation, elimination of
marker redundancy, BLAST annotation; (4) insertion into
the database.
Marker and sequence source
The current version of MoccaDB provides information
regarding Coffea EST and genomic SSR markers retrieved
from 11 published studies as well as original data (table
1). The database stores 638 markers, defined on 259 ESTs
and 379 genomic sequences.

Complete information on the origin of the data was
reported such as laboratory, DNA library description, and,
finally, reference of the published work. Polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) primers, amplification conditions, and
expected product sizes were directly retrieved from the
publications, when available.
For most of the markers, nucleotide sequences were
downloaded
from
GenBank
databases
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and stored in the database.
A unique set of markers
Most of the retrieved markers had been declared by their
authors as designed on unigenes or, at least, on nonredundant DNA sequences. Nevertheless, to identify any
redundancy due to the multiple origin of the data, all
DNA sequences were checked for homology using the
DNASTAR software package (Lasergene, Madison, WI,

USA). The markers designed on sequences having a similarity percentage >90% were defined as "similar markers"
in the database.
Annotation
Markers stored in the database are provided with a general
SSR description: repeat motif and number, corresponding
amino acid repeat if any, and, if known, SSR position on
the sequence (coding region or UTR, as described in [2]).

Markers associated with experimentally described metabolic pathways (e.g. sucrose metabolism during coffee
fruit development [9]) were integrated. Putative functions
were predicted for all DNA sequences through similarity
searches using BLASTx against GenBank protein databases
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov[10].
Maps, transferability and diversity
Marker mapping data were retrieved from a published
inter-specific Coffea linkage map [11] and can be visualized with CMap [12], integrated in MoccaDB.

The high transferability of SSR markers at evolutionarily
conserved (orthologous) loci within the Coffea genus has
been previously reported by different authors. For example, the percentage of transferability of SSR markers developed on C. arabica genomic DNA ranged from 72.7% for
C. liberica Hiern to 86.4% for C. pseudozanguebariae Bridson [13].

Our previously published [2] and newly designed EST-SSR
markers (Table 1), at a total of 99, were tested for amplification on a panel consisting of up to 21 Rubiaceae species
belonging to the Cinchonoideae and Rubioideae subfamilies [14](Table 1). A new set of EST-SSR markers, provided by Crouzillat et al. (Table 1), was also tested on the
following Coffea species: C. canephora, C. heterocalyx Stoff.,
and C. pseudozanguebariae. Only those showing a good
and specific PCR amplification with an easy scoring of
allele sizes were retained.
Both for markers retrieved from publications and for
those designed and/or tested in this study, a maximum of
available transferability-associated information was
stored in the database: transferability status, amplification
quality, information on the polymorphism (number and
sizes of alleles within a given species, polymorphism
information content (PIC) value).
Database and Web application
MoccaDB has been designed for simple and efficient
information search and retrieval. It is currently housed on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/123

a Linux Red Hat Enterprise server but is generally platform-independent. The database design has been carried
out using the Unified Modeling Language (UML). MoccaDB is composed of two major components: a relational
database created using open-access MySQL 5.0 and a PHP
web application that communicates with the database.
The web interface runs on the Apache 2 Web server. The
PHP scripts dynamically execute complex SQL queries to
retrieve data from the database according to user criteria
and display them as a standard HTML output using CSS
style sheets. MoccaDB also integrates bioinformatics tools
such as BLAST [10] and CMap [12]. For an overview of the
MoccaDB structure and interaction with the bioinformatics tools and external data sources, see Fig. 1.
The database contains mainly public but also some private data. The public data are accessible to any person
connected to the MoccaDB Web site. To access to the private data of some scientific projects as well as to insert
one's own data (markers, DNA sequences or mapping
data) in the database, the user should open an account
that is created with the permission of the scientific project

manager. Several supplementary Web interfaces have thus
been developed allowing the user an administrative access
and database feeding.

Utility
A user-friendly web interface has been developed to facilitate data retrieval according to specific user needs. One
can search for markers, DNA sequences, maps and diversity data by using the corresponding multi-option query
forms. The data can be viewed with a different degree of
details, either as an overview (a list of search results), or as
a detailed result page for a selected marker, sequence or
map, with information on marker transferability, diversity
and mapping. The experimental conditions, sequences
and other relevant data are easily downloadable in different formats. Some additional information, like the construction of DNA libraries or description of the marker
types, can be visualized with the help of pop up windows.
Extensive, mostly bi-directional, hyperlinks are provided
between the different data pages, thus facilitating the navigation within the web site (Fig. 1).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/123

Synthetic and downloadable information on annotated
markers
Through the marker search page, markers can be directly
searched by their names but the query can also be filtered
by marker type, species and sequence origin, as well as by
the availability of experimental data on their transferability and mapping.

The search results are displayed in the form of a table providing general information on each marker. The users can
select any number of markers from this table and download them as an Excel file, together with additional
optional information such as PCR experimental conditions, original DNA sequence, diversity/transferability or
mapping data, depending on their scientific interests and
future data utilisation. They can also access the detailed
individual marker pages via the hyperlinks associated with
each marker.
A typical individual marker page (Fig. 2) displays detailed
information on diverse marker aspects: original sequence

The result page provides general information about the SSR marker (e.g. repeat motif, repeat number) as well as the corresponding genomic sequence with database cross-references to NCBI and SOL (if available) and a hyperlink to the MoccaDB
Sequence detail Page (B). The mapping information section provides information about marker locations on the genetic map,
which links to the CMap viewer (C) and the CMap feature detail popup (D). The PCR information section may also provide
details on marker assay conditions (forward and reverse primers, melting temperatures, predicted size of PCR product). The
reference section gives publications related to this marker with links to Pubmed.

and export them in FASTA format. The sequence detail page (B) displays all the associated information for that sequence which
includes general information (e.g.: sequence type, DNA bank), annotation information, marker information and publications
related to that sequence. Hyperlinks give access to associated data within MOCCAdb such as markers, DNA bank or link to
external resources such as SOL or NCBI.

information, map location, transferability and/or intraand inter-diversity, existence of "similar" markers developed on the same locus by other researchers, etc....
The genetically mapped markers can also be searched
through the map search page. For each map, linkage
groups can be displayed separately or together thanks to
the CMap tool. A link associated with each SSR marker on
the map brings the user back to the marker data page (Fig.
2).
Functional markers directly targeting the expressed genes
A user can search for sequences used to design the markers
through the sequence search page. The query will optionally take into account the sequence name, species origin,
sequence or marker type, and, more specifically, its putative function, namely a keyword in the BLAST annotation
(e.g. transferase, Fig. 3). The sequence search page is especially useful when searching for "functional" markers
linked to a particular metabolic pathway. Among different
functions, the database is hosting markers associated with
the sucrose metabolism [9].

The resulting searched sequences are displayed in a summary table with hyperlinks that give further access to
sequence or marker data pages (Fig. 3). From this table,
sequences selected by the user can be downloaded in a
multi-fasta file to facilitate subsequent external analyses
(BLAST search, clustering, etc...).
These functional markers could also be used in such studies as functional mapping, population analyses or association mapping.
Transferable markers and polymorphism status
Transfer of genomic tools across species boundaries is crucial to assess variation in relevant germplasm and constitutes a unique tool to study orphan related species.

In its current release, MoccaDB already gives access to valuable transferability data. In particular, of the C. canephora
and C. arabica markers screened for cross-amplification
and polymorphism, a minimum of 83% amplified alleles
from any wild Coffea species, independently of its genetic
relationship to both cultivated species (Fig. 4). Across the
Rubiaceae family, many coffee markers were transferable
to wild relatives of the Cinchonoideae subfamily, but only
a fraction, maximum 12%, was transferable to distantly
related genera in the Rubioideae subfamily (Table 2).
When working on one or more given species, the biologist
can thus use the diversity query page to search markers
that amplify these species, and eventually reveal inter-specific polymorphism (such as species-specific alleles) or
intra-specific polymorphism (through the PIC parameter). Results for the searched markers are displayed in the
form of a summary table (Fig. 5) with details on the
marker transferability: species tested, amplification status,
polymorphism, amplified allele range. These data will be
particularly useful for researchers looking for an optimal
polymorphic marker set for genotyping populations of a
given species.
If the objective is the selection of markers for refining
mapping in an inter-specific cross, or for discriminating
two or more species, the user can identify diagnostic
markers (i.e. with species-specific allele range) with
known genetic map location or not.
A synthetic results table of these data can be obtained and
downloaded from the marker search query page (Fig. 5).
Bioinformatics tools and external links
CMap and the NCBI BLAST2.0 [10] were integrated into
MoccaDB. Any given sequence can be searched for similarities against the MoccaDB sequences or updated public
GenBank Coffea databases: (1) all C. arabica and/or C.

Conclusion and perspectives
Contrary to some currently existing plant marker databases that contain predicted molecular markers (e.g.
[16]), MoccaDB only stores validated markers provided
with experimental protocols and related data. Indeed, we

intended to centralize information on markers associated
with single-copy loci, which can be reproducibly used for
genetic analysis within the Coffea genus and related species.
Some Coffea genetic markers were made available by very
few open and freely accessible database resources (Trieste
[17], CIRAD [18]), but these resources are mostly limited
to SSR data generated by their own hosting institute.
MoccaDB includes most of the publicly available data in
addition to original data. As compared to the previously
released databases, MoccaDB provides greater integrated
information and specific features:

MoccaDB evolution
In MoccaDB, a large amount of information is centralized
and freely accessible to all users. A login system exists only
for private project access and for data submission. To facilitate data integration, comma-separated values (csv) submission forms have been defined to allow automatical
submission of data. More markers will be included in the
database as and when they are made publicly available.

The database currently houses SSR markers from both
genic and non-genic regions of the genome. Markers
whose polymorphism is due to single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs), insertion/deletion (indels) or transposable elements are in the process of being developed
and will be stored in MoccaDB in a near future.
Coffee has increasingly rich genetic and genomic
resources including expressed sequences tags (ESTs) [e.g.
[2]] and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries
[6,19]. Whole genome sequencing, genetic, physical and
comparative maps are being developed. MoccaDB will be
extended to include new data types, but also links to cytological maps and morphological data.
Systematic efforts have been initiated to generate PCRbased comparative genetic maps in several clades of
plants, particularly in Solanaceae using Conserved
Ortholog Set (COS) markers [20]. Data obtained in this
family could be of benefit for wide comparative genomics
studies including those of Rubiaceae species.
