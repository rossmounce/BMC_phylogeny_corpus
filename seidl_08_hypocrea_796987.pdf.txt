Abstract
Background: The hypercellulolytic mutant Hypocrea jecorina (anamorph Trichoderma reesei) RUT
C30 is the H. jecorina strain most frequently used for cellulase fermentations and has also often
been employed for basic research on cellulase regulation. This strain has been reported to contain
a truncated carbon catabolite repressor gene cre1 and is consequently carbon catabolite
derepressed. To date this and an additional frame-shift mutation in the glycoprotein-processing βglucosidase II encoding gene are the only known genetic differences in strain RUT C30.
Results: In the present paper we show that H. jecorina RUT C30 lacks an 85 kb genomic fragment,
and consequently misses additional 29 genes comprising transcription factors, enzymes of the
primary metabolism and transport proteins. This loss is already present in the ancestor of RUT C30
– NG 14 – and seems to have occurred in a palindromic AT-rich repeat (PATRR) typically inducing
chromosomal translocations, and is not linked to the cre1 locus. The mutation of the cre1 locus has
specifically occurred in RUT C30. Some of the genes that are lacking in RUT C30 could be
correlated with pronounced alterations in its phenotype, such as poor growth on α-linked oligoand polyglucosides (loss of maltose permease), or disturbance of osmotic homeostasis.
Conclusion: Our data place a general caveat on the use of H. jecorina RUT C30 for further basic
research.

Background
In modern biotechnology, many of the fermentations
producing high volume/low price products make use of
microbial strains which have been improved by classical
mutagenesis using UV light or mutagenic chemicals.
Information about the loci which became altered in the

process of mutation and selection for improved product
formation is scarce, if available at all. One notable exception is penicillin production by the fungus Penicillium
chrysogenum [1-3], where the early mutation program has
been shown to have removed detoxification reactions for
the side chain precursor and has increased the biosynPage 1 of 15

thetic capacity by amplification of the gene cluster for its
production. In the case of the industrial cellulase producing fungus Trichoderma reesei, the anamorph of the pantropical ascomycete Hypocrea jecorina, all of the strains
that are currently used on a commercial scale have been
ultimately derived from one single isolate which was collected on the Solomon Islands during World War II [4,5].
The genetic basis of the respective mutations which led to
enhanced cellulase production in these industrial strains
is essentially unknown. However, B.S. Montenecourt and
D.E. Eveleigh prepared two separate lines of mutants
which led to the hypercellulolytic strains RUT C30 and
RL-P37 ([5]; Fig. 1), of which H. jecorina RUT C30 has
become the most frequently used strain for laboratory cellulase production [6-11]. In this strain two of its genetic
changes have been described: one is a truncation in the
cre1 gene encoding CRE1 the carbon catabolite repressor
protein, which renders this strain carbon catabolite derepressed [12]; and another one leading to a frameshift
mutation in the glycoprotein processing β-glucosidase II
encoding gene [13]. Electrophoretic karyotyping showed
that the two largest chromosomes in RUT C30 are somewhat smaller, whereas the other five chromosomes are
somewhat larger, resulting in a total increase in genome
size from 32.5 to 34.7 Mbps [14]. Gene mapping revealed
a history of significant recombination events between the
seven chromosomes, but no gene losses were observed so
far [14,15]. The only exception that was noted was the
absence of hybridization of one random clone (RC16) in

RUT C30, which hybridized to chromosome IV in strain
QM6a and chromosome I in strain QM9414 [14]. This
suggests the presence of many more changes in RUT C30,
which have not been uncovered until today.
Due to its carbon catabolite derepressed phenotype, H.
jecorina RUT C30 has frequently been used as a reference
strain in studies on the regulation of gene expression [1618] or cell biology [19]. In a similar type of study, we have
recently observed that the transcript of a gene was completely absent from RUT C30, and subsequently we found
that also the gene was absent from this strain (Christian
Gamauf, Christian P. Kubicek and Bernhard Seiboth,
unpublished data). In the attempt to identify the reason
for the absence of this gene, we discovered that H. jecorina
RUT C30 lacks a large (85 kb) segment of genes present on
scaffold 15 of the genomic sequence of the wild-type
strain H. jecorina QM6a http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Trire2/
Trire2.home.html, [20]. The identification of these genes,
and their correlation with changes in the phenotype of H.
jecorina RUT C30 compared to strains QM6a and
QM9414, are reported in this paper.

Methods
Fungal Strains and culture conditions
The Hypocrea jecorina strains QM6a (wild-type; ATCC
13631), QM9414 (early cellulase overproducing mutant;
ATCC 26921), NG 14 (ATCC 56767) and RUT C30
(ATCC 56765) were used throughout this study. They
were maintained on PDA slants (potato dextrose agar;
Difco, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and stock cultures kept at
-80°C.

For shake flask cultures, 200 ml of Mandels Andreotti
(MA) medium [21] with carbon sources added as given at
the respective results sections, was suspended into 1 L
Erlenmeyer flasks, inoculated with 5 × 107 spores, and
incubated on a rotary shaker at 28°C and 200 rpm. To
induce polyol dehydrogenases, glycerol 1% (w/v) was
used as a carbon source. Cultures were harvested after 24
hrs by gentle filtration, and replaced onto fresh MA
medium with either L-arabinose, erythritol or xylitol as an
inducer (10 mM), and incubated for further 12 hrs. At this
time they were harvested and used to prepare cell-free
extracts (see below).
Detection production of antimicrobial agents
Secretion of potential antimicrobial polyketides was
tested by an agar diffusion method and plate confrontation tests. For the former, culture filtrates from various
time points during growth- and stationary phase on D-glucose and lactose as a carbon source were sampled, proteins denatured by heating (100°C, 5 min), and the
samples then concentrated to a tenth of their volume in a
Speed Vac. They were then filtered through 20 μ filters

(Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and pipetted into 8 mm
holes punched into agar plates containing inocula of
Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the plate confrontation tests, 8 mm diameter agar
plugs of mycelia of the two strains of H. jecorina were
placed 5 cm apart from a respective colony of the same
microbes. The presence of an antimicrobial component
was indicated in both methods by a clearing zone.
Nucleic acid isolation and hybridisation
Chromosomal DNA and total RNA were isolated as
described [22,23]. Standard methods [24] were used for
electrophoresis, blotting and hybridization of nucleic
acids.
PCR analysis
The open reading frames described in the results section
were amplified from H. jecorina QM9414 and RUT C30
genomic DNA using the GoTaq® system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) with 0.4 μM of sequence specific primers
(Table 1) and 2 mM MgCl2. The amplification protocol
consisted of an initial denaturation step (2 min at 95°C)
followed by 28 cycles of denaturation (1 min at 95°C),
annealing (45 s at the primer specific temperature) and
elongation (2–5 min at 72°) and was concluded by a final
7 min elongation step (72°C).
Genome Walking
To identify the 5' end of the deletion, the GenomeWalker™ Universal Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA,
USA; [25]) was used. Briefly, this method first constructs
pools of uncloned, adaptor-ligated genomic DNA fragments. Then, two PCR amplifications are preformed per
library: the first uses the outer adaptor primer (AP1, provided by the manufacturer) provided in the kit and the
outer, gene-specific primer (GWRUT C30gsp1; Table 1).
The resulting PCR mixture is then used as a template for a
secondary or "nested" PCR with the nested adaptor
primer (AP2, provided by the manufacturer) and the
nested gene-specific primer (GWRUT C30gsp2; Table 1).
The DNA fragments were then cloned and sequenced.
PCR amplifications were performed using the Long PCR
Enzyme Mix (Fermentas, St.Leon-Rot, Germany). Distinct
PCR products were amplified from libraries constructed
with DraI and StuI endonucleases and sequenced (MWG
Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany).
Amplification and sequencing of the cre1 locus in H.
jecorina RUT C30
The wild-type H. jecorina cre1 locus is located on scaffold
2, and its open reading frame (ORF) spans from 786955–
789433 (ID 120117). Oligonucleotides used for the
amplification of the cre1.1 mutation in strain RUT C30
and are given in Table 1.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/327

Enzyme extraction and assays
Preparation of cell free extracts and assay of xylitol and Larabinitol dehydrogenases was performed essentially as
described previously [26,27]. Erythritol dehydrogenase
was measured in the same way as L-arabinitol dehydrogenase, but using 100 mM erythritol as a substrate.
Microscopical analysis
Conidida from 7 – 10 day old cultures were collected and
suspended in liquid Mandels Andreotti medium [21] containing either 1% or 10% (w/v) glucose and cultivated at
28°C. 50 μl drops of conidial suspension were placed on
large cover slips and examined at room temperature by
using differential interference contrast optics with a 60×
(1.2 numerical aperture [NA]) water immersion plan apo
objective on an inverted Nikon TE2000 microscope
(Nikon, Kingston-Upon-Thames, UK). Images were captured with a Nikon DXM1200F digital camera and transferred into Adobe Photoshop software (version 10.0;
Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) for further
processing.
Biolog Phenotype Microarray analysis
Global carbon assimilation patterns were investigated
using Biolog FF MicroPlate™ (Biolog Inc., Hayward, CA,
USA), using the protocol published recently [28]. Briefly,
H. jecorina strains were pregrown on 20 g·l-1 malt extract
agar, and 90 μl of a conidial suspension from them (75 ±
2% transmission at 590 nm) dispensed into each of the
wells of a Biolog FF MicroPlate™ (Biolog Inc., Hayward,
CA, USA). Inoculated microplates were incubated in the
dark at 30°C, and percent absorbance determined after
12, 18, 24, 36, 42, 48, 66 and 72 h at 750 nm. Analyses
were repeated at least three times for each strain.
Statistical Analysis
Basic statistical methods such as multiple regression analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) as well as multivariate exploratory techniques (cluster and factor analyses)
were performed using STATISTICA 6.1 (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa,
OK, USA) data analysis software system.
Sequence analysis and phylogeny
The genome sequence of H. jecorina is available [29]. To
screen the genome for genes missing in strain RUT C30,
the "browse" function was used. Genes are identified by
their protein ID number (search → gene models → protein id). Sequence analysis of the genes identified to be
missing in H. jecorina RUT C30 was performed with InterProScan [30]) and SMART (/; [31]). Proteins with most
similar sequences were identified by BLASTX[32]. For phylogenetic analysis, protein sequences were aligned using
CLUSTALX 1.83 [33], the alignment edited with GENEDOC
2.6 [34] and the phylogenetic analysis performed in MEGA
3.1 [35].

expressed in H. jecorina QM9414 but not in strain RUT
C30 (C. Gamauf, C. P. Kubicek and B. Seiboth, unpublished data). Consequently, we tested by PCR whether this
gene is actually present in the latter strain. Using the rgx1specific primers given in Table 1, a clear product of
expected size could be amplified from strain QM9414,

but not from RUT C30 (Fig. 2a). Since this could indicate
a gene deletion at this locus, we then designed primers for
the amplification of the immediate 5' and 3' flanking
genes (i.e. a monocarboxylate transporter, ID 109211;
and an aldehyde dehydrogenase, ID 65142; respectively).
As these two genes were apparently absent from strain
RUT C30 too (Fig. 2b), a larger gene lesion was assumed.
Therefore we screened for presence of genes with wider
distance from the rgx1 locus until positive hits were
found, and then reduced the intervals until the genes
immediately flanking the gap could be identified. Thereby
the first gene located 3' of the gap in RUT C30 was identified as a nitrilase, ID 64996. However, no gene could be
found in the 5' direction of the gap, because even amplification of the most 5' located gene on scaffold 15 was not
possible in strain RUT C30.
Since these data suggested that the gap may be continued
on another, unknown scaffold, we applied a genome
walking strategy. Primers were designed to hybridize
within the intergenic region between the gene encoding a
hypothetical protein, ID 79726, and the gene encoding a
nitrilase, ID 64996 (primer GWRUT C30gsp1) and within
the coding region of ID 79726 (primer GWRUT

C30gsp2). Interestingly, in contrast to our assumptions,
this method identified the 5' end of the gap close to the
beginning of scaffold 15 in an AT-rich region (at +1555
bp; Fig. 3a). This breakpoint localizes within a large intron
in the 5'-half of an ORF encoding a putative rhodaneselike protein ID 109199. This gene displays a high number
of unusually long introns (Fig. 3a), and it is possible that
these either represent annotation errors or it is a pseudogene. A closer investigation of this gene was beyond the
scope of this paper, however.
The 3' end of the gap identified by genome walking corresponded to the region identified by PCR amplification
and specified it at +86603 bp of scaffold 15 in the 5' nontranscribed area of the nitrilase-encoding gene (see
above). Thus, this analysis provides evidence that H. jecorina RUT C30 contains an approximately 85 kb large gap
on scaffold 15, which in H. jecorina QM6a [20] contains
29 ORFs (Fig. 3b) and that most of these genes are not
present in the genome anymore.
The 85-kb deletion is unlinked to the cre1 mutation
As the reason for this gene deletion in RUT C30 is
unknown, we wondered whether it would be topologically related to the cre1.1 mutation. The cre1 locus in this
strain has been shown to be truncated [11], but the exact
length of the mutation and its genomic location has not
yet been reported. A BLAST search of the H. jecorina
genome sequence database with the cloned cre1 gene
identified it to be located on scaffold 2: 786955–789433
(ID 120117), and thus distant from the locus of the lesion
which was identified in this paper. In order to identify the
cre1.1 mutation, we amplified and sequenced the cre1
locus in strain RUT C30. Using the primers Cre1fw and
CreIIr (Table 1), PCR with QM9414 DNA resulted in a
3565 bp fragment as expected, whereas RUT C30 yielded
a fragment of 1087 bp only. Sequencing of the fragment
obtained with RUT C30, and its alignment with the
sequence of scaffold 2 (Fig. 4) revealed the loss of a 2478
bp fragment which starts 3' of the region encoding the
CRE1 zinc finger and reaches into a noncoding region.
The coding region of the immediately following gene
(tre12588) was not affected.
In silico identification of the genes lacking in H. jecorina
RUT C30
In order to evaluate the impact of the detected gene losses
on the phenotype of H. jecorina RUT C30, we first performed a detailed in silico analysis of the encoded putative
proteins (Table 2). Most of the ORFs could be aligned
with proteins of known function, and only three of them
encoded completely unknown proteins. Two genes
encoded Cys6Zn(II)-type transcription factors, which are
only found in fungi [36]. However, orthologues of these
two transcription factors have not been described in any

metabolism (e.g. two aldehyde dehydrogenases, one
aldo/keto reductase, one alcohol dehydrogenase, one
glycerol dehydrogenase and one trehalase), and three
transporters (a maltose permease, a monosaccharide
transporter and an amino acid permease). The latter is
very similar to a general amino acid permease that was
characterized from Amanita muscaria [37]. Four other
genes encoded extracellular enzymes (a glucan endo-1,6β-glucosidase, a carbohydrate esterase, and the rhamnogalacturonase RGX1 that initially triggered this study).
Finally, two of the genes missing in H. jecorina RUT C30
encoded proteins involved in cellular detoxification pathways, namely a multidrug efflux pump and a glutathione
S transferase, and gene one encoded a class I reducing
polyketide synthase.
H. jecorina RUT C30 is impaired in the assimilation of αglucans and -glucosides
The presence of a maltose permease in the missing
genomic fragment raised the question whether this would
have an impact of the growth of H. jecorina RUT C30 on
α-linked glucans and glucosides. As can be seen from Fig.
5, growth on dextrin, starch, maltose and maltotriose was
indeed strongly impaired in RUT C30, which is consistent
with the absence of a maltose permease responsible for αglucoside uptake. This interpretation is supported by the
fact that H. jecorina – in contrast to several Aspergillus spp.
– does not have multiple maltose permease genes
(unpublished observations) and also lacks an extracellular α-glucosidase [38]. The present findings are therefore
consistent with a metabolism of α-glucosides in H. jeco-

rina by uptake and intracellular hydrolysis, which is
impaired in RUT C30.
H. jecorina RUT C30 displays several alterations in carbon
source assimilation
In view of the relatively strong abundance of metabolic
genes in the genomic region which is missing in H. jecorina RUT C30, we performed a comprehensive analysis of
its ability to assimilate (i.e. grow on) carbon sources using
95 carbon sources contained in the Biolog Phenotype
Microarrays, and compared it to its wild-type strain
QM6a. The data obtained (Fig. 6) identified several striking differences: strain RUT C30 had a strongly impaired
growth on L-arabinose, L-erythritol, D-galactose and also
2-keto-D-gluconic acid. Interestingly, the opposite effect
(= an enhancement of the assimilation rate) was also
observed with some other carbon sources, e.g. glycerol, Nacetyl-β-D-glucosamine, D-mannitol, D-fructose, D-trehalose, D-mannose, D-ribose). This strongly reduced growth
on L-arabinose, L-erythritol and also D-galactose suggested to us that one of the aldo/keto-reductases identified as lacking in strain RUT C30 (i.e. ID 65142, ID 6567,
and ID 64956) could be involved in polyol assimilation.
In order to test this hypothesis, we prepared cell free
extracts from strains QM9414 and RUT C30, and tested
these activities in cell-free extracts. As shown Table 3, both
strains of H. jecorina had high NAD+-linked dehydrogenase activities with xylitol, L-arabinitol and erythritol and
NADPH-linked dehydrogenase activities with D-xylose
and L-arabinose as substrates, respectively. Activities with
the other coenzyme (i.e. NADP with xylitol, L-arabinitol
and erythritol; and NADH with D-xylose and L-arabinose)
were negligible, with the exception of some NADP+linked activity of strain RUT C30 on xylitol, which was

absent from strain QM9414. In general, activities in strain
RUT C30 were significantly higher. Only the NAD+-linked
erythritol dehydrogenase activity was similar in both
strains. These data indicate that the loss of the three aldo/
ketoreductases in RUT C30 has apparently no effect on its
metabolism of the major polyols and therefore cannot
explain the different growth pattern of strain RUT C30 on
L-arabinose and L-erythritol
H. jecorina RUT C30 favors high osmotic pressure
The glycerol dehydrogenase GLD2; EC 1.1.1.156; [39]),
which is lacking in H. jecorina RUT C30, has been shown
to be involved in glycerol formation during osmoadaptation in A. nidulans [40] and H. atroviridis ([41]; there
named GLD1). We were therefore interested to see
whether the loss of glycerol dehydrogenase would render
strain RUT C30 osmotically unstable. We grew strains
QM9414 and RUT C30 in submerged culture on 1 and
10% (w/v) glucose. The results are shown in Fig. 7a: strain

RUT C30 had a longer lag phase for growth but then accumulated about double the concentration of biomass than
strain QM9414 under both conditions. The conversion
yield YX/S on 1% (w/v) glucose was 0.45 and 0.63 for
strain QM9414 and RUT C30. While a yield over 0.5 can
be explained by the utilization of amino acids in peptone
for biomass formation [42], these data show that RUT
C30 accumulates biomass more efficiently under both
conditions. Yields on 10% (w/v) glucose were 0.08 and
0.22, respectively. This indicated that the loss of glycerol
dehydrogenase did not render strain RUT C30 osmotically
labile, but that it even performed better than strain
QM9414 at high osmotic pressure.

In order to learn the reason for the prolonged lag phase in
strain RUT C30, we microscopically examined the germination of its spores. This analysis revealed that RUT C30

size before they start to form a germ tube (Fig. 8). While
spores of H. jecorina QM9414 showed a uniform spore
diameter of 6 – 10 μm during spore germination, H. jecorina RUT C30 spores swelled up to a diameter of 20 – 30
μm, corresponding to an up to 50 – fold increase of spore
volume (Fig. 8a–d). Interestingly, not all RUT C30 spores
showed a swelling response and the extent of the swelling
varied, resulting in a relatively homogenous distribution
of spore diameters from ca. 10 to 25 μm. Germination was
observed from swollen and not swollen spores and
osmotic stress (10% carbon source) did delay germination but not influence the ratio of swollen to not swollen
spores. However, although germination from even
extremely swollen spores was observed, apparently not all

swollen spores were able to enter the germination phase
and during later growth stages a number of large spores
that had undergone autophagic cell death [43] could be
detected (Fig. 8e). The spore swelling and autophagy of
swollen spores in H. jecorina RUT C30 could result in a
delay of the formation of an interconnected mycelium
and therefore explain the observed prolonged lag phase of
RUT C30.
H. jecorina RUT C30 lacks pigment formation
An intriguing observation during the cultivation experiments was that strain RUT C30 does not form the yellow
pigment, which is characteristic for H. jecorina and other
Trichoderma spp. from section Longibrachiatum [44]. This
difference was observed both in late submerged cultures
as well as during plate growth. We suspected that this
could be due to the absence of the class I polyketide synthase ID 65172. In order to test this presumption, we subjected its amino acid sequence to phylogenetic analysis
(NJ) with other polyketide synthases investigated by Kroken et al. [45]. In this analysis (data not shown), the H.
jecorina polyketide synthase was determined to be member of clade I from the reducing polyketide synthases,
thereby clustering most closely to Bipolaris mayidis PKS5,
whose function is not known. Since none of the members
of this cluster is known to be responsible for pigment formation, but some of them (e.g. the lovastatin synthase)
synthesize antimicrobial polyketides, we also tested
whether RUT C30 would be deficient in formation of an
antimicrobial compound. However, using the agar diffusion assay and the confrontation assay, we could not
detect any such compound in strain QM9414 and consequently also not in RUT C30 (data not shown). While the
use of more sensitive methods such as MS may detect differences in secondary metabolite production between H.
jecorina QM6a and RUT C30, our data show that the loss
of this class I polyketide synthase does not influence the
antimicrobial activity of H. jecorina.

H. jecorina NG 14 has a full-size cre1 but lacks the 85 kb
fragment
Both, H. jecorina RUT C30 and its ancestor NG 14, are
mutants that underwent mutagenesis by nitrosoguanidin
and were selected for growth on cellulose in the presence
of glycerol (NG 14) and 2-desoxiglucose (RUT C30). We
therefore wondered whether the loss of the 85 kb fragment and the truncation of cre1 were the result of one or
both of these mutation steps.

In order to test the presence of the full-length or the truncated cre1 gene in NG 14, we designed primers creF and
creR (table 1). CreR hybridizes in the 2.5 kb fragment of
the cre1 locus that is absent in RUT C30 (see above) and
should therefore result in amplification of a 2.9 kb fragment from the native cre1 gene only. Using these primers
we could amplify the expected PCR product from
QM9414 and NG 14 but not from RUT C30 (Fig. 9a). On

the other hand using primer creF in combination with
primer creRUTr, binding downstream of the cre1 truncation, we amplified a 1.9 kb fragment corresponding to the
truncated cre1.1 gene from RUT C30, whereas the two
other strains yielded a larger (4.4 kb) fragment corresponding to the native genomic locus (Fig. 9b). Consequently, we conclude that the cre1 truncation specifically
occurred in H. jecorina RUT C30.
In order to test for the presence or absence of the 85-kb
gene fragment, which is missing in RUT C30, the gene specific primers for ORFs 3, 4, 5, 10, 20 and 26 (table 1) were
used. By means of these primers, we were unable to
amplify a PCR product from strains NG 14 and RUT C30,
whereas amplicons were obtained in the control with
QM9414 (data not given), indicating that the large chromosome lesion is already present in the ancestor of RUT
C30.

Discussion
In the present work we have shown that the hypercellulolytic mutant H. jecorina RUT C30, in which only two
mutations (in the carbon catabolite repressor protein
CRE1 and the processing β-glucosidase II [12,13] had
been described so far, carries a major deletion in its
genome which comprises 85.048 bp including 29 open
reading frames. Although this finding had not been
detected so far, it is in accordance with earlier karyotyping
results, which showed that the size and number of chromosomes in H. jecorina strain RUT C30 differed significantly from QM6a and QM9414 [14,15]. Unfortunately,
none of the marker genes that were used in these studies
was located on scaffold 15, and we were thus unable to
identify the chromosome on which the 85 kb fragment
described in this paper is lacking. However, despite of the
fact that these 0.085 Mbp are a significant lesion, they are
small compared to the changes in chromosome size determined by these authors. While the size determination in
contour-clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) gel
is not sensitive enough to distinguish between 0.1 and 0.2
Mbp, it is nonetheless possible that more deletions may
be present in the genome of RUT C30.
The reason for this gene loss in RUT C30 is unclear. The
genealogy leading to mutant RUT C30 involved three
mutagenesis steps from the wild type strain (Fig. 1), of
which the first one was simple UV mutagenesis whereas
the subsequent two (from M7 to NG 14, and from NG 14
to RUT C30) involved mutagenesis by N-methyl-N'-nitro-

N-nitrosoguanidine [5]. However, both agents usually do
not lead to chromosome alterations or translocations. The
results from genome walking have shown that the 5' site
of the deletion is located in a region containing an about
1600 nt long palindromic AT-rich region (PATRR).
PATRRs have been found to mediate genomic instability,
thereby contributing to translocations, deletions and
amplifications [46,47]. Carter et al. [15] have speculated
that the lack of a sexual cycle and the need for mitotic pairing of chromosomes arising from there may increase the
tolerance of mitosporic fungi to chromosome rearrangements. In the light of the above reasoning, PATRRs may be
preferred regions for this. In N. crassa, this has been
shown to be due to escape from het-c incompatibility
[48]. The possibility that such rearrangements may regularly occur in H. jecorina would be consistent with similar
data from other fungi [49], and also be consistent with
results from the analysis of the genome of H. jecorina
QM6a [20] which revealed a number of gene conversion
events. In addition, such events could also occur during
the regeneration of protoplasts after transformation with
DNA (as shown for Nectria haematococca [50]), which
would explain the high phenotypic diversity in H. jecorina
transformants [27]. Our results with H. jecorina NG 14
show that the loss of the 85 kb gene fragment already
occurred before the origin of RUT C30, and such an event
must therefore have taken place in this or even an earlier
mutant strain.
The structure of the gene encoding the rhodanese-like protein also supports such a scenario: this gene does not have
any orthologues in fungi, but shows similarity to flavibacterial rhodanese-like proteins. It is conceivable that this
gene arrived by horizontal gene transfer in an instable
region, which led to the insertion to this unsual high
number (14) of introns. The gene seems to be active,
though, as the database lists 15 ESTs for it.
We were not able to predict the putative function of all
genes which have been lost in RUT C30. Although we
could therefore not to relate all of these genes to distinct
phenotypic properties, for some of them clear correlations
were obtained. One of them was the inability to grow on
α-linked oligo- and polysaccharides, which we interpret to
be due to the loss of the maltose permease gene (ID
65191). This finding implies that H. jecorina RUT C30
may not be a good source of enzyme production on carbon sources containing starch and other α-linked glycans,
unless this deficiency is complemented by the corresponding gene from QM 9414.
Another intriguing finding during this study was that the
loss of glycerol dehydrogenase GLD2 does not lead to an
impaired osmotolerance. Consistent findings have been
reported with a gldB-knock out strain of A. nidulans [40],

Page 13 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:327

where it was shown that this strain failed to accumulate
glycerol during osmotic stress, but instead accumulated
other polyols including D-mannitol, L-arabinitol and Lerythritol. It is therefore possible that other polyol dehydrogenase genes of H. jecorina can compensate for the loss
of GLD2. However, the microscopic findings from this
study, i.e. that RUT C30 displays a significant swelling of
its conidia before it starts to germinate, indicate that
osmotic homeostasis is impaired in this strain. A possible
explanation for this finding would be that the compensating polyols (L-arabinitol, L-erythritol) are less fast metabolized, and thus lead to an increased osmotic pressure in
the spores and delayed germination. The carbon source
assimilation experiments also revealed that strain RUT
C30 shows an enhanced growth rate on a number of simple carbon sources such as glycerol, N-acetylglucosamine,
D-mannitol, D-fructose, D-trehalose, D-mannose, and Dribose. Interestingly, there is evidence that some of them
act as catabolite repressing carbon sources in H. jecorina
(e.g. glycerol, [18]; fructose, [51]; mannose, unpublished
data by L. Hartl, C.P. Kubicek and B. Seiboth). The phenotype in RUT C30 may be related to the loss of function of
CRE1, and be due to the relief of catabolite repression by
these carbon sources within their own catabolic pathways,
most likely at the level of uptake. Sugar permeases of H.
jecorina and other mitosporic fungi are known to be
repressed by elevated levels of their substrates [52,53].
This property enables strain RUT C30 to grow faster at
high sugar concentrations such as 6% lactose, a condition
employed to make use of its superior cellulase forming
capacity [54].

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have identified a major genomic alteration in the hypercellulolytic mutant strain H. jecorina RUT
C30, and have been able to correlate several of them with
not yet apparent phenotypes of this strain. Likely, insights
provided in this paper may only just be the beginning,
and further such changes may be found when its genome
would be subjected to a more thorough investigation.
While the differences between the parent strain and RUT
C30 do not interfere with the use of RUT C30 in biotechnology for the production of cellulases, it is clear that the
use of this strain for basic research in physiology or molecular genetics is flawed. This is especially true for its use as
a "carbon catabolite derepressed" mutant, because the
truncation in its CRE1 protein clearly is only one of several more changes compared to its wild-type parent. Such
a comparison may only be valid, if the results are compared to the mutant strain NG 14 in which the cre1 truncation has not yet occurred.
