Abstract
Background: A Baltic population of Atlantic sturgeon was founded ~1,200 years ago by migrants
from North America, but after centuries of persistence, the population was extirpated in the 1960s,
mainly as a result of over-harvest and habitat alterations. As there are four genetically distinct
groups of Atlantic sturgeon inhabiting North American rivers today, we investigated the genetic
provenance of the historic Baltic population by ancient DNA analyses using mitochondrial and
nuclear markers.
Results: The phylogeographic signal obtained from multilocus microsatellite DNA genotypes and
mitochondrial DNA control region haplotypes, when compared to existing baseline datasets from
extant populations, allowed for the identification of the region-of-origin of the North American
Atlantic sturgeon founders. Moreover, statistical and simulation analyses of the multilocus
genotypes allowed for the calculation of the effective number of individuals that originally founded
the European population of Atlantic sturgeon. Our findings suggest that the Baltic population of A.
oxyrinchus descended from a relatively small number of founders originating from the northern
extent of the species' range in North America.
Conclusion: These results demonstrate that the most northerly distributed North American A.
oxyrinchus colonized the Baltic Sea ~1,200 years ago, suggesting that Canadian specimens should be
the primary source of broodstock used for restoration in Baltic rivers. This study illustrates the
great potential of patterns obtained from ancient DNA to identify population-of-origin to
investigate historic genotype structure of extinct populations.

Background
Sturgeons (Acipenseriformes: Acipenseridae), the producers of caviar, are remnant survivors of the once flourishing
chondrosteans, dominant fishes of the Permian period.
The continued persistence of these 'living fossils' is threat-

ened throughout North America, Europe, and Asia. Today
there are two species of Atlantic sea sturgeons; the European sturgeon Acipenser sturio, found in France (Gironde
basin), and the Atlantic sturgeon A. oxyrinchus inhabiting
the rivers and coastal waters from the Gulf of Mexico to

the Canadian Maritime Provinces. Although classified as
sister species and showing some phenotypic similarities,
approximately 60 million years of isolation [1] has
resulted in physiological differences between these two
species. For example, European sturgeons prefer spawning
temperatures ≥ 20°C, while Atlantic sturgeons exhibit latitudinal variation in spawning temperatures ranging from
as low as 13°C in Canada to 26°C in the southeastern
U.S. [2].
According to archaeological and molecular dating, a population of Atlantic sturgeon was founded in the Baltic Sea
during the Middle Ages (8th and 10th century) by migrants
from North America [3]. These founders created a self-sustaining population, which became disjunct from the western Atlantic populations. This Baltic population has been
over-exploited by commercial fisheries and was extirpated
in the 20th century. A group of international fishery managers are now seeking to re-establish the extirpated population using fish from the original source population(s),
on the grounds that North American A. oxyrinchus exhibit
sufficient ecological and genetic potential for a successful
restoration. To increase the probability of success of such
a restoration in the long-term, the ideal scenario would be
to identify and use a founder group that is genetically
closely related to the extinct population. Although the
utility of ancient DNA studies to elucidate evolutionary
relationships and guide restoration projects has been recognized [4-7], the full extent of management applications
from these studies have not yet been realized.
In this study, we investigated the evolutionary and demographic characteristics of the historic founders, by performing an extensive genetic characterization of the
extinct Baltic population derived from medieval tissue
samples representing their first generations starting at the
8th century. We focused on identifying the region-of-origin of the North American founders, and on calculating
the effective number of individuals that originally
founded the Baltic population ~1,200 years ago.

Results
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
Two hundred and twenty seven DNA samples from 586
ancient bony scutes (8th – 13th c.) were successfully
screened for their mtDNA control region haplotypes. The
species A. sturio and A. oxyrinchus were differentiated by 22
diagnostic substitutions (> 10% sequence divergence)
[see Additional file 1]. Two hundred and twenty scutes
had A. oxyrinchus control region haplotypes (218 haplotype A, and one haplotype BS1 [EU684143] and BS2
[EU684144] each, respectively). Seven scutes shared haplotype AS17 from A. sturio.

Morphological classification
The morphology of 210 bony scutes was preserved sufficiently to identify species. Of this number, 176 were classified as A. oxyrinchus; whereas 34 showed typical A. sturio
surfaces. Morphological classifications were subject to
error depending on the state of scute preservation. However, 183 (87%) samples were classified as the same species based on morphology and mitochondrial DNA. Four
scutes yielding A. sturio haplotypes showed A. oxyrinchus
morphology; in contrast 23 scutes had A. oxyrinchus
mtDNA and A. sturio morphology.
Amplification of nuclear DNA
Allelic profiles of 29 (out of 50) randomly selected scutes
from Ralswieck, Island of Rugia Germany were successfully amplified. The 29 randomly selected scutes yielded
unique multilocus genotypes. Locus Afu-39 was monomorphic in two populations (Table 1). Profiles of seven
polymorphic microsatellite loci were used for the assignment analysis: Afu-19 (trinucleotide), Afu-39 (trinucleotide), Afu-68 (tetranucleotide), Afu-54 (tetranucleotide),
Aox-45 (trinucleotide), Aox-23 (trinucleotide) and Aox-12
(imperfect nucleotide). All loci used in this study showed
allelic patterns of disomic inheritance. The detected structure (four clusters) of A. oxyrinchus populations was
related to their geographic distribution. Baltic and Canadian sturgeons grouped together (Figure 1A). STRUCTURE results showed a high allele-frequency similarity of
Baltic samples with Canadian samples (28 samples were
assigned to the Canadian population). A single sample
was assigned to the Mid-Atlantic population. Probability
values for region-of-origin assignment are given in Table
2. FST estimates (10100 permutations) (Table 3) and
AMOVA values (Table 4) were calculated using Arlequin v.
3.0 [8] based on haplotype frequencies of mtDNA control
region sequences.
Identification of hybrids
Flanking sequences of locus Aox-23 were successfully
amplified for 47 (of 50) scutes as previously described [3].
Three hybrids (fish with nuclear sequences from both species) and four introgressed specimens (mtDNA = A. sturio
and nDNA = A. oxyrinchus) were identified. Additional
assignment tests calculated in STRUCTURE including 100
artificial hybrids generated between fishes from source
populations (Canadian, Mid-Atlantic) and European sturgeons (A. sturio) designed in HYBRIDLAB 1.0 clustered
Baltic sturgeon together with Atlantic sturgeon, and produced no evidence for a historic hybrid population (Figure 2).
Inference of the founder population size
Using ancient and contemporary DNA data for eight
genetic loci (7 autosomal microsatellites and mtDNA),
the size of the founding population to the Baltic Sea was

inferred using the Approximate Bayesian Computation
(ABC) method. When the posterior densities obtained for
the 8 genetic loci are combined, the effective founding
population size is likely to be less than 10 (Table 5, the

baseline case). To evaluate the sensitivity of the results to
the assumptions and methods used, different population
histories, parameter values and estimation methods were
tested. These included a more limited source population
(Canadian only), the larger/smaller sizes of the modern
North American/Baltic populations, different time points
for colonization, and different rejecting/weighing procedures. Although the 95% HPD (Highest Probability Density) intervals varied, the estimated total population sizes
were less than 20 individuals in most cases. A strong bottleneck signal was exhibited by both mtDNA data and also
a few microsatellite loci. The assumption about the source
population had a strong impact on the results. The 95%
HPD interval became bigger when the Canadian population was assumed to be the only source, because the
resolving power of the statistical analysis declined due to
their low genetic diversity.

Discussion
Restoration projects are often faced with the problem that
little information is available when choosing a founder
group for restorative breeding, especially when native
populations became extinct many decades ago. One powerful way of obtaining more information is to analyze the
genetic structure of historic populations and their relationships to extant populations [7]. Recent progress in
ancient DNA analysis enables investigations of historic
population structures [5,6]. This information can be used
to select specimens for introduction from appropriate
regional groups, taking under consideration that individuals from different environments may exhibit evolutionarily important differences in adaptively significant traits.
Congruent patterns of population structuring among collections of extant A. oxyrinchus have been identified in
both mitochondrial [9,10] and microsatellite DNA [11]
which consisted of four regional clusters in the western
Atlantic: 1) Gulf (A. o. desotoi in tributaries of the Gulf of
Mexico), 2) southeastern (rivers in Georgia and South
Carolina), 3) Mid-Atlantic (Hudson and Delaware rivers),
and 4) Canadian (Kennebec, St. Lawrence and St. John)
(Figure 1B). In the present analysis of the microsatellite
profiles of the ancient Baltic population, 28 out of 29
(97%) individuals were assigned to the Canadian regional
grouping and one fish was assigned to the Mid-Atlantic
grouping (Figure 1A) as identified in previous studies. An
overwhelming predominance of Canadian A. oxyrinchus
genotypes within the ancient Baltic population was similarly observed in the mtDNA sequence data set (Figure
1C); 218 of 227 (96%) bony scutes shared haplotype A
while the two remaining specimens had haplotypes BS1
and BS2, which are likely recent derivatives from haplotype A (Figure 3). However, it is difficult to decide when
and where these "new" haplotypes evolved; prior to colonization in North America, or after the founding event in

the Baltic. If there were 3 or more female founders, it is
possible that BS1 and BS2 may have evolved in North
America. Prior this study, 45 North American haplotypes
from this control region fragment have been described.
Many of them were observed in only a few fish, sometimes single specimens [e.g. [9,10,12,13]]. Considering
the fact that most North American populations are representing less than 10% of their population sizes 100 years
ago [14], haplotypes BS1 and BS2 could have become
regionally extinct in North America. By contrast, if there
was only one female founder, the two haplotypes must
have evolved in the Baltic Sea.

Pairwise Fst estimates based on partial control region sequences
calculated in Arlequin v. 3.0. by computing conventional F-Statistics
from haplotype frequencies [8,41].

These results demonstrate that the most northerly distributed A. oxyrinchus successfully colonized the Baltic Sea,
suggesting that Canadian specimens may have characteristics suitable for the environmental and ecological conditions that existed during the original founding. The IUCN
reintroduction guidelines state that the organisms used
for reintroduction should be as closely related as possible
genetically to those originally inhabiting the habitat [15].
We suggest therefore that Canadian specimens should
dominate the broodstock for reintroduction.
As recent physiological and biogeographic studies implicate temperature as a primary selection force for species
survival and persistence of populations [16,17], a second
factor for consideration might be including specimens
from populations with broader thermal tolerances in
order to minimize risk to the restored population through
climate change. The inclusion of specimens from the MidAtlantic population could potentially extend the thermal
amplitude in associated physiological responses.
In any case, from an ecological point of view, there are
potentially many factors which might contradict each restoration plan [18,19] (e.g. climate change, concurrence
with other species, introduction of parasites or diseases).

Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) based on mitochondrial haplotype distances calculated in Arlequin v. 3.0 [8].

We observed a small number of hybrids and introgressed
specimens indicating a historic Baltic population of A. sturio; a conclusion that is supported by the archaeological
record [2]. Recently, the Baltic population was suggested
to be a hybrid population between European sturgeons
and Atlantic sturgeons [20]. However, this conclusion is
not supported by the outcome of this study. Taking genotype distribution observed for the 8th–13th centuries [this
study] and 18th–19th centuries [3] under consideration,
most likely both species were sympatric during the founding event. Later, A. sturio was likely displaced by Atlantic
sturgeons due to the cooling during the Little Ice Age. A.

sturio may have evolved characteristics suitable for a
warmer environment [A. sturio needs spawning temperatures ≥ 20°C whereas spawning temperatures of A. oxyrinchus range between 13–26°C; reviewed in [2]] rendering
the species physically unable to persist permanently in the
Baltic region. Baltic region was the most eastern historic
distribution area of A. sturio. This region is characterized
by a cold, continentally influenced climate. However,
immigrations (colonization attempts) of A. sturio from
the North Sea (e.g., Elbe River) into Baltic rivers can not
be excluded during warmer decades until the North Sea
population became extinct during the last century.

Estimated size of the founding population (NF) to the Baltic Sea at the Early Middle Ages. The ABC method was applied to 1,000,000 simulated
genetic data sets (mtDNA control region and 7 microsatellite loci). The following population history was assumed as a baseline 1: a small part of the
source (Canadian, Ca, and Mid-Atlantic, Mid) populations colonized the Baltic Sea at 1200 years or 60 generations before present (TF), experienced
single-generation bottleneck (Tbot), then the populations of both sides of the Atlantic (NA, NB) kept a constant size (effective population size = 2,000)
until the Baltic population became extinct. Modified population assumptions were tested in the scenarios 2–6; 95% HPD (highest probability
density) intervals are listed.

Assuming Canadian and Mid-Atlantic populations of A.
oxyrinchus as the original founders, our simulations suggested that the Baltic Sea was colonized by fewer than 10
founders (females and males). The estimated number of
founders changed as components of the simulation
model were varied, but the estimated mean was 20 individuals at the largest. This finding was based on a discretegeneration model and relatively simple population

dynamics. It must be noted that the assumption of constant population size is not likely to be valid, as intensive
harvest caused drastic changes to population sizes. However, testing of several different scenarios indicated that
this result was quite robust. There may have been several
colonization events, but the outcome of this study indicates that only one of them is likely to have succeeded.
From a genetic point of view, our study suggests that it

may be possible for a small number of founders to result
in a sustainable population.

Conclusion
Ancient DNA population genetic studies are a valuable
tool for obtaining more information on historic population structure and information to select specimens for
introduction from appropriate regional groups. Furthermore, our results indicate that only a small number of
individuals may have been sufficient for the establishment and persistence of a self-sustaining population. This
agrees with recent studies which suggest that successful
colonization from a small number of individuals probably occurs more often than previously thought [21]. Our
findings suggest that given a suitable environment, a longterm viable population may result from even a small
founding population with limited genetic diversity, thus
encouraging ongoing efforts to preserve and restore populations.

Methods
Archaeological samples
Bony scutes were excavated from two Medieval sites at the
German Baltic coast, i.e. Ralswiek (Isle of Rugia, n = 538)
and Wilhelmshof (Peninsula Usedom; n = 48). According
to the historic record Ralswiek was a marine trading port
in the late 8th and 9th centuries [22]. In the succeeding centuries (10th – 12th c.) the site lost its importance and
became an agrarian settlement. Excavations (1972–1984)
revealed a large faunal collection with numerous fish
remains. The bony scutes of sturgeons studied here are
from the early period in which sturgeons were very common and important in human diet during this time for
consumption as indicated by the archaeological context
[23]. In the late period (10th – 12thc.) sturgeons are rare
among the fish remains from the cultural layers, indicating a decline in sturgeon occurrence. Similar temporal
changes in the importance of sturgeon as a fish for consumption have been observed at other important Medieval sites of the Baltic coast, i.e. Gdansk (Poland) and
Staraja Ladoga (Russia). Wilhelmshof is a non-agrarian
settlement of the 12th–13th centuries with evidence for
local handicraft and trade [24]. A small collection of fish
remains (n = 178) is available from this site. Sturgeon is
represented by 48 bony scutes, which were targets of the
morphological and genetic analyses. Both species have
different scute surfaces [25,26]. Scute surfaces of A. oxyrinchus are alveolar, while A. sturio have tubercular surfaces
[drawings of scutes were published recently in [2]].
Authenticity of DNA Sequences
DNA extraction and PCR were performed at the ancient
DNA Laboratory at the Paleogenetics Group at the Institute of Anthropology of the University of Mainz, a laboratory dedicated to ancient DNA analyses following strict

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/221

guidelines. We applied the criteria for the authenticity of
ancient DNA as previously described [27]. DNA was
extracted from bony scutes after UV irritation from each
side for 30 minutes. For each scute 0.25–0.5 g material
was milled and incubated overnight in 2 ml EDTA buffer,
200 μl N-Laurylsarcosidase and 20 μl Proteinase-K followed by a phenol-chlorophorm extraction with a final
concentration step using Centricon©-100 columns. Blank
controls were included in every DNA extraction as well as
in every PCR. Sturgeons had never been analyzed in the
ancient DNA laboratory before. No evidence for contamination was detected during the entire study.
Mitochondrial DNA analysis
Cloning (Invitrogen) and sequencing (3100 ABI capillary
sequencer; Applied Biosystems) were performed at the
Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, Berlin
using standard procedures. PCR was performed using
primers Hetero I and Hetero II or RevA, amplifying a short
fragment of the control region (~200 bp) as previously
described [28]. PCR products were purified by treatment
with ExoSAP-IT™ (USB). A minimum of two independent
PCRs were performed for each DNA extraction. Analysis
of molecular variance (AMOVA) was calculated in Arlequin v. 3.0. Intraspecific relationships were calculated
using NETWORK 4.2.0.1.
Nuclear DNA analysis
Microsatellite PCR's were performed as previously
described [11,29]. Length detection using 3100 ABI capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems) were performed at
the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, Berlin
using standard procedures. Again, blank controls were
included in every PCR setup. We used the procedure previously described [30] to minimize allelic dropout or artifacts: all loci were amplified from two independent DNA
extractions. In case of differences between both runs
(homozygous vs. heterozygous), this procedure was
repeated until a sufficiently secure result was achieved
otherwise the sample was discarded. Samples with ambiguous amplifications of multiple alleles were discarded for
that locus. Allele length standardization between previously published data of A. oxyrinchus from rivers St. Lawrence and St. John (n = 39, Canadian population),
Hudson and Delaware (n = 54, Mid-Atlantic), Albermarle
Sound and Altamaha River (n = 37, South East), and
Suwannee River (n = 48, Gulf) [11] and our ancient samples (taking into account different running conditions
and devices between both labs) were performed on sample exchanges and validation of allele lengths after finishing ancient DNA analysis because shifts of +/- one allele
can be found between genotyping platforms. A modelbased assignment test was performed based on microsatellite data using STRUCTURE 2.0 [31]. Neither hybrids
nor introgressed specimens (see below) were included in

assignment tests. All 29 ancient samples included in the
assignment test were classified as A. oxyrinchus based on
their morphology and shared mtDNA A. oxyrinchus-haplotype A. No signs of hybridization or introgression as
indicated by their microsatellite locus Aox-23 flankingregion sequences were observed. Each scute produced a
unique multilocus genotype. Population subdivision of
A. oxyrinchus [Canadian, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Gulf
populations – see [11]] was investigated using the admixture model and MCMC simulations (50,000 burn-in steps
followed by 100,000 replications) for different numbers
of clusters (K = 2–10). For each different K, the estimates
of posterior probability Pr(X|K) (simulation summary Ln
P(D)) were compared [32] choosing the ΔK showing a
clear peak (K = 4–5). After this, Baltic samples (aDNA)
were included using the admixture model (K = 4; 100,000
burn-in steps; 1,000,000 replicates). Ten replicated runs
were calculated for comparison of Ln P(D)-values and the
clustering.
Hybrid detection
A. sturio and A. oxyrinchus have several diagnostic substitutions in the flanking region of the microsatellite locus Aox23 [3,29]. These substitutions were used as a hybrid
marker. Hybrid detection was focused on scutes: i) showing a disagreement between morphology and mtDNA (n
= 27), ii) all scutes having A. sturio haplotype AS17 (n =
7), and iii) to bring the sample size up to fifty we added
16 randomly selected scutes with A. oxyrinchus haplotype
A. PCR products were cloned using the TOPO TA Cloning
Kit® (Invitrogen). Approximately 20 clones of each sample
(n = 901 clones) were sequenced. Additionally, HYBRIDLAB 1.0 [33] was used to simulate an artificial hybrid population between A. sturio (Gironde population, France –
allelic data were published in [34]] and A. oxyrinchus
(Canadian population). One hundred F1-hybrid genotypes were modeled. An additional assignment test using
STRUCTURE included artificially generated hybrids,
potential founders (Canadian and Mid-Atlantic sturgeons), Baltic sturgeons, and Gironde sturgeons (A. sturio).
Inference of the founding population size
The size of the founding population in the Baltic Sea in
the Early Middle Ages was inferred from seven microsatellites and mtDNA control region sequences. The following
population history was assumed in our simulations: a
small part of the source (Canadian and Mid-Atlantic)
populations colonized the Baltic Sea at 1,200 years before
present (ybp), then the populations of both sides of the
Atlantic kept a constant size (effective size = 1,000 with a
50:50 sex ratio) until the Baltic population became
extinct. The Baltic founder population was assumed to
experience a single-generation bottleneck, because the
population size of species having a potential to produce a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/221

huge number of offspring is expected to show a dramatic
increase after they settle themselves in a suitable environment. However, we also tested bottleneck periods of different lengths, as well as a gradual increase of the
population size after the colonization, to check the sensitivity of the results to this assumption. Coalescent simulations were iterated 1,000,000 times, varying the effective
population size of the founders as well as the source. Uniform prior distributions are assumed for both founder [1,
500] and source [100, 10,000] females as well as mutation
rates (one mutation in [10,000, 100,000] years). In general, fishes are characterized by very low mutation rates
and sturgeons have one of the lowest mutation rates
within all vertebrates [35]. As we analyzed ancient Baltic
samples (microsatellites: n = 18–30, mtDNA n = 218) and
NA modern samples (microsatellites: n = 93, mtDNA n =
183) as real data, we took an equivalent number of
ancient samples from the simulated Baltic population at
800 ybp as well as of modern samples from the simulated
NA population. A stepwise mutation model was used for
microsatellite evolution, while an infinite site model was
used for mtDNA evolution. Generation time was assumed
to be 20 years [36]. A discrete-generation coalescent
method [37] was used to follow the change in the allele
frequencies.
The approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) method
[38] was applied to the simulated data set. The analyses
were carried out using functions of the statistical package
R provided by Mark Beaumont (University of Reading,
UK). Out of the three elements (local regression, local
weighing, and local density estimation) of the original
ABC, the local regression procedure has a potential problem. The actual founder size used in each simulation iteration is increased or decreased by local regression on the
basis of the deviation of simulated genetic data from the
observed data. Because the range of founder sizes is rather
small in the present study, the mathematical treatment
can produce zero or negative founder sizes which never
happen in the real world. Therefore, we carried out the full
ABC analysis after log transformation of the variable. We
also confirmed that our conclusions were unchanged if we
used the untransformed data and applied the ABC without local regression to them. Posterior probability was calculated for each locus based on the following summary
statistics: number of alleles, number of private alleles, and
Nei's gene diversity (for both microsatellites and
mtDNA); and number of segregating sites (mtDNA only).
Normalized Euclidian distances between the summary
statistics values of the simulated data and those of the
observed data [39] were calculated for each iteration. Each
locus showed a different bottleneck signal, but our main
discussion was based on the combined posterior probability. One thousand out of 1,000,000 simulated data (pδ
= 0.001) with the smallest distances were selected and

used in the final analyses. Local weighing and calculations
of the posterior density functions were carried out for each
locus using the R functions.
