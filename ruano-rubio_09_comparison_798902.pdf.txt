Abstract
Background: Phylogenetic profiling encompasses an important set of methodologies for in silico
high throughput inference of functional relationships between genes. The simplest profiles
represent the distribution of gene presence-absence in a set of species as a sequence of 0's and 1's,
and it is assumed that functionally related genes will have more similar profiles. The methodology
has been successfully used in numerous studies of prokaryotic genomes, although its application in
eukaryotes appears problematic, with reported low accuracy due to the complex genomic
organization within this domain of life. Recently some groups have proposed an alternative
approach based on the correlation of homologous gene group sizes, taking into account all
potentially informative genetic events leading to a change in group size, regardless of whether they
result in a de novo group gain or total gene group loss.
Results: We have compared the performance of classical presence-absence and group size based
approaches using a large, diverse set of eukaryotic species. In contrast to most previous
comparisons in Eukarya, we take into account the species phylogeny. We also compare the
approaches using two different group categories, based on orthology and on domain-sharing. Our
results confirm a limited overall performance of phylogenetic profiling in eukaryotes. Although
group size based approaches initially showed an increase in performance for the domain-sharing
based groups, this seems to be an overestimation due to a simplistic negative control dataset and
the choice of null hypothesis rejection criteria.
Conclusion: Presence-absence profiling represents a more accurate classifier of related versus
non-related profile pairs, when the profiles under consideration have enough information content.
Group size based approaches provide a complementary means of detecting domain or family level
co-evolution between groups that may be elusive to presence-absence profiling. Moreover positive
correlation between co-evolution scores and functional links imply that these methods could be
used to estimate functional distances between gene groups and to cluster them based on their
functional relatedness. This study should have important implications for the future development
and application of phylogenetic profiling methods, not only in eukaryotic, but also in prokaryotic
datasets.

Background
A decade has passed since the introduction of phylogenetic profiles to elucidate functional relationships
between gene products. The basic assumption in the phylogenetic profiling approach is that convergent evolution
of traits, e.g. gene co-presence and co-absence patterns
across genomes are due to inter-dependence between
those traits [1]. For example, if the activity of a gene A is
dependent on the existence of another gene B, a fixed
deletion of B renders A redundant and consequently A
will be eventually lost due to genetic drift as it is no longer
subject to selective constraints. Phylogenetic profiles of
gene presence-absence are typically encoded as a binary
sequence of 1's (presence) and 0's (absence) where each
position in the profile corresponds to a particular species
under study (Figure 1). Functional dependencies between
genes should then result in a smaller number of differences in the corresponding profiles than expected by
chance.
Since their introduction, phylogenetic profiling
approaches have evolved and a number of novel methods
have been developed to quantify the similarity between

two profiles or to statistically evaluate the reliability of the
predicted functional relationships. These methods can be
coarsely divided into two categories depending on
whether they take into account the underlying species
phylogeny: non-phylogenetic approaches that include
pairwise distance comparisons [1], mutual information
[2] or Pearson correlation [3] and phylogeny-aware
approaches that rely on parsimony [4], maximum-likelihood [5] or kernel-methods [6] based scoring. In theory,
phylogeny-aware approaches are preferable due to the statistical bias introduced by gene content inter-dependence
between closely related species, and it has been shown
that such methods can improve the prediction of functional links in eukaryotic genomes [5]. Nevertheless, these
methods remain computationally complex. As a consequence, some groups have proposed phylogeny-based
heuristic corrections with the goal of reducing the inherent biases in a computationally efficient manner (e.g. [7]).
Despite the successful application of phylogenetic profiles
in a number of studies involving prokaryotic genomes
(reviewed in [8]), profiling in eukaryotes has received little attention. Moreover, based on combined prokaryotic
and eukaryotic studies, some groups have concluded that
the statistical signal is severely disrupted by inclusion of
eukaryotic genomes [9,10]. To measure the extent to
which these methods can be applied in studies of eukaryotes, Singh and Wall [11] constructed phylogenetic profiles consisting exclusively of eukaryotic genomes and
detected some correlation for proteins within the same
functional module determined using the Gene Ontology
[12]. This finding indicates the presence of at least some
statistical signal in eukaryotes.
As an alternative to these co-evolution studies based on
individual genes, a number of recent studies have independently proposed a different approach based on the
correlation of homologous gene group sizes across
genomes. Ranea and colleagues [13] grouped protein
encoding genes hierarchically in families based on their
3D structure (CATH structural domains) and sequence
similarities. They then measured the evolutionary convergence between them through copy number, referred to here
as group size, correlation analyses based on a euclidean distance statistic to quantify profile pair relatedness. Cordero
and coworkers [14] studied the co-evolution between
pathway co-occurring gene families from the COG database [15]. They introduced a more sophisticated phylogeny-aware approach based on the reconstruction of the
histories of gene content across phylogenetic lineages.
Thus, gene families (or groups) that showed concerted
changes in size at the same branches along the species tree
are predicted to have co-evolved. Despite their methodological differences, both studies reached the conclusion
that considering gene group size instead of total presence

or absence of a particular gene can lead to a considerable
improvement in predictive performance, at least in their
respective datasets. In addition, very recently Tuller and
colleagues [16] applied non-parametric correlation analysis of gene group size changes along branches of the species tree to elucidate functional relationships between GO
terms. They used this approach in conjunction with correlation of evolutionary rates to reconstruct a global gene
co-evolution network in yeast species.
Although all these approaches have been used successfully
in a certain number of studies, no objective comparison
has been performed to evaluate their relative performance, particularly in the more complex situation of
eukaryotic genome studies. Here, we have constructed a
benchmark containing both positive examples of functionally related gene pairs and negative examples of unrelated pairs, based on the functional relationships defined
in the STRING database [17]. The benchmark contains
examples of two different types of relationships: physical
protein-protein interactions (PPI) and co-occurrence in
the same cellular pathway (CoPW). We have used this
benchmark to perform a comprehensive study of "classical" gene presence-absence phylogenetic profiles, as well
as gene group size based analyses taking into account the
species phylogeny, in order to measure the ability of each
technique to predict these functional relationships in the
eukaryotic life domain.

animals, fungi and amoebae for analyses that required a
rooted tree. The figure was built using FigTree v1.2.2 http://
tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/.

Methods
Gene group test sets in eukaryotes based on orthology and
shared domains
The first step in any phylogenetic profiling analysis is the
definition of homologous gene groups in the set of species
under study. Here, we have used a large test set of eukaryotic orthologous gene groups extracted from the
OrthoMCL database version 2 [18]. This orthology prediction database offers a broad eukaryote species sampling
and has performed well in gene function based benchmarks [19]. Each orthologous group may contain an arbitrary number of paralogs within each species as
determined by the OrthoMCL multi-species algorithm
[20], typically resulting from post-speciation gene duplications. Therefore OrthoMCL groups are appropriate for
the evaluation of both presence-absence and gene group
size based approaches as functional link predictors in
eukaryotes at the domain level. The resulting test set
includes a total of 53 eukaryotic species (Figure 2) and
54228 orthologous gene groups present in at least two of
these species.

Since the OrthoMCL group granularity may be too fine for
group size based analyses to be effective, we also generated a coarser gene grouping based on InterPro database
[21] domain and family level matches across all eukaryo-

tic proteins in OrthoMCL (using the precomputed
matches available on the OrthoMCL database website).
This second approach frequently leads to genes being classified in more than one group due to the presence of
multi-domain or fusion proteins. Despite the fact that
such co-occurrence may in fact be a good indication of
functional relationship between groups (the rosetta-stone
method [22]), it obscures the evaluation of the real merit
attributable to the phylogenetic profiling approach itself.
Therefore, we excluded from our analyses, profile comparisons between gene groups where the size of their intersection was greater than 1% of the size of the smaller group.
Any effects due to group overlap were considered negligible below this threshold. The resulting set includes 4378
groups present in at least two eukaryotic species. Table 1
shows some general statistics relevant to this study concerning the groups generated using OrthoMCL and InterPro based approaches.
Eukaryotic phylogeny and selection of conserved gene
groups
In order to apply more accurate genome phylogeny based
profiling methods, we needed to specify a fully resolved
species phylogeny for the 53 species under analysis. We

used a curated phylogeny (Figure. 2) taking into account
the current understanding of deep evolutionary relationships between eukaryotic taxon groups [23-27]. The root
of the tree was placed at a plausible location corresponding to the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes: the split
between unikonts (amoebozoa, fungi and metazoa) and
bikonts (platae and the rest of protists) [28]. In order to
focus on functional relationships that may be relevant to
most of the eukaryotic species examined, we considered

only those gene groups that expand across these two
major taxon groups. The final dataset consisted of 8999
OrthoMCL and 2716 InterPro groups.
Gene presence-absence profiling
For each of the groups in the 2 datasets described above, a
presence-absence profile was constructed, with each position corresponding to the 53 species under study. The
position in the profile was set to 1 if the species was
present in the orthologous group, regardless of the
number of genes, and was set to 0 if the species was
absent. The similarity of each pair of profiles was then
measured using two different approaches: (i) co-occurrence of group loss as inferred using Dollo parsimony and
(ii) weighted-hypergeometric and runs-corrected scores.
These two approaches are described in more detail below
and in Figure 3.

Dollo parsimony was initially conceived as a tool to infer
phylogenies [29], but recently some studies have applied
this approach to the analysis of the evolution of gene content in genomes and functional linkage between proteins

details). Then, profile pairs are tested for evidence of co-evolution (GSCOR and GSHGT).

in eukaryotes [30-32]. Dollo-parsimony assumes that of
two possible state transitions, in our case, presence to
absence and vice versa, one is more probable than the
other. In the current context, we assume that gene gains
can only occur once, but that genes can be lost independently in many lineages. Thus we assumed that recurrent
gain of the genes in different eukaryotic lineages via lateral
gene transfer (LGT) is relatively small in comparison to
the number of genes inherited vertically.
In order to measure the statistical significance of the similarities observed between two profiles, we applied the
hypergeometric test based on the four possible result
classes (i.e. combinations of presence and absence) at
each position on the profile. We also implemented the
phylogenetic correction used in the STRING database by
compressing subtrees with all extant taxa in the same
result class into a single observation (described in [8]).
Additionally we bound trees at branches where a gene
group loss occurs in either of the two orthologous groups.
We considered that two gene groups cannot influence
each other's evolution long after one of them has been
lost (i.e. after the next speciation event in the species tree
under study). In the rest of the article we refer to this
method as DPCP (Dollo-parsimony compressed profiles).
Presence-absence profiling using ordered profiles and runsbased scoring
This is the approach proposed by Cokus and coworkers
[7]. In summary, their approach scores the number of
coincidental co-presences (1 and 1) in a pair of group profiles, taking into account the proportion of gene groups
present in each genome (weights) and the species phylogeny. The scoring procedure does not consider the tree
topology per se, but it does so indirectly by ordering the
species in the profiles according to their evolutionary relationships and then counting the number of runs (i.e. maximal consecutive co-presence positions) between two
profiles (Figure 3). Although not equivalent, the number
of runs is positively correlated with the combined number
of gene group gains and losses in both profiles and thus
the information content present in the profile pair. For
example, multiple co-presences found within a small
number of runs may indicate gene conservation in lineages rather than co-evolution, whereas the same number
of co-occurrences in a larger number of runs is a more
convincing indicator of true co-evolution.

The number of observed runs and the resulting score
depends on how we graphically sort descendant subtrees
at each ancestral node in the species tree. We chose a single order for all comparisons following the approach indicated in the original paper [7], which involves minimizing
the genome content dissimilarities between adjacent

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/383

genomes in the profile. From this point on we refer to this
method as WRUNS.
Gene group size profiling
In gene group size based profile approaches, instead of
coding gene groups according to presence and absence,
the exact number of gene group members at each genome
is preserved at each position. Therefore there is no loss of
information at this point. Methods that do not take into
account the phylogeny (e.g. [13]) could compare the profiles with no further changes. However, phylogeny aware
methods include an additional step where profiles
"unfold", by incorporating an additional position for
each ancestral taxon or internal node in the species tree
that contains an estimated ancestral group size. Then, the
group sizes in the profile are transformed into the final
signed size change along the branch that lead to them
(Figure 3 right). This is calculated as the group size at that
node minus the group size at the direct ancestor on the
tree. As a result, each position in the final profile, representing a branch in the species phylogeny rather than an
extant species, includes a neutral sign or 0 if there was no
size change, a negative number if the gene group
decreased in size, contraction, or a positive number if its
size increased, expansion.
Reconstruction of ancestral gene group sizes
A key element in these approaches is to infer ancestral
gene group sizes. Here we used two different approaches:
a parsimony based reconstruction method and a new
approach based on gene trees.

For the parsimony based reconstruction, we implemented
the algorithm described in Cordero et al 2008, who minimized a cost function on the minimum number of genetic
events (individual gene losses, duplications or gains) necessary to explain the observed pattern of group sizes in
extant species. Here, we used the cost function F (Eq. 1);
in this function we do not consider de novo gene gains,
that would result from LGT, thus increases in gene group
size can only be due to existing gene duplications. We
adjusted the gene duplication, d, to loss, l, cost ratio
parameter, μ, using observed relative frequencies using
the gene tree based reconstruction approach (μ = 2.5).

Fm (d , l) = m d + l

(1)

The novel gene tree based approach involves the reconstruction of the genealogy for each gene group and the
mapping of gene gains and losses onto the species tree. To
do this, we used the MAFFT software [33] to construct
multiple sequence alignments for each gene group. Then
we used the TreeBest package [34], first to build the corresponding trees using the neighbour joining (NJ) algo-

rithm on multiple substitution corrected amino acid
distances, and second to map genetic events onto
branches on the species tree.
Often protein domain rearrangements and fast sequence
evolution hampers sequence alignment and in turn gene
tree reconstruction. Consequently, we needed to split
each gene group into subgroups more amenable to alignment and tree inference. In order to do this, we performed
a greedy decomposition in maximum cliques using
Cliquer [35]. Here we define a clique as a subset of genes
whose sequences are aligned with any other member of
the clique over at least 50% of the length of the shortest
sequence in the pair. This threshold was determined in
tests on a subset of groups and permits reconstruction of
subgenealogies without over-fragmentation of the subfamilies. At each decomposition step, the maximum
clique is subtracted from the remaining set of genes until
only one or zero remains. Since calculating maximum
cliques is a computationally demanding problem (NPhard in complexity theory terms), we used Nmclique [36],
an approximate heuristic solver, as long as the remaining
group size was greater than 300 genes. Finally, once a gene
group was fully decomposed, TreeBest was run on each
subgroup and inferred genetic events were merged by adding them up on the corresponding branches of the species
tree.
Group size based profiling significance testing
We applied two methods to identify gene group size
change profile pairs that show a significant level of coevolution: first using a correlation test on unmodified size
change values and second using a hypergeometric test on
the distribution of the sign of the change (expansions and
contractions) across branches. We refer to these as GSCOR
(correlation test of group size change) and GSHGT
(hypergeometric test of group size change) in the text
from now on. Subscripts (Pars) and (GeneT) indicate that
ancestral group size were reconstructed using parsimony
or gene trees respectively (Table 2).

For GSCOR we implemented an approach similar to the
one proposed by Cordero and colleagues [14] but opted
for a non-parametric method, Kendall-t ranks correlation
coefficient and p-values as changes are not necessarily

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/383

normally distributed. We also tested a partial correlation
correction to take into account the bias effects of heterogenous genome sizes. However this did not result in an
improvement in predictive performance (data not shown)
thus we opted for the uncorrected version, relying on
empirical thresholds and the p-value fitted distribution to
eliminate this and other biases as described in Results and
Discussion.
In both approaches we did not take into consideration
ambiguous branches that exhibit no group size change.
This allows a binary encoding of expansions and contractions in GSHGT and avoids numerous ties of 0 in GSCOR.
Measure of profile pair information content
For the GSCOR method, we used the number of branches
considered in the test, i.e. those with expansions and contractions in both profiles, to quantify information content. In contrast, for DPCP, WRUNS and GSHGT, we used
the geometric average of the profile entropies multiplied
by the length, lij, of the profile pair under consideration:

IC ij = l ij H i H j

(2)

The individual profile entropy H is calculated using the
fraction of positions for each possible symbol (DPCP
{0,1} and GSHGT {-,+}):

H i = −p i (− / 0) log 2 p i (− / 0) − p i (+ / 1) log 2(+ / 1)
(3)
Calculation of information content adjusted profile pair
scores
We used two approaches that take into account IC, in
order to classify profile pairs as putatively co-evolving or
not. First, we used a single cut-off threshold based on a
negative control set built as described below. Second, we
fitted a bivariate distribution of scores versus information
content for each method using the kernel approach implemented in the MASS R package (function kde2d).
Positive and negative test sets
We used the STRING database version 7 [37] as a unified
source of both experimentally verified and computation-

ally inferred protein-protein functional relationships. We
built two different categories of true positive (TP) datasets.
The first set, TPCoPW, contained gene pairs that participated in the same KEGG cellular pathway [38] as stored in
STRING. The second set, TPPPI, included interacting protein pairs from interactome databases present in STRING
(see [37] for details). We propagated the relationships
defined for individual genes to gene groups, if there were
at least two disjoint pairs of genes in each group that were
functionally related to each other. In the case of TPCoPW, at
least one pair must belong to a unikont species and the
other to a bikont. This way we intrinsically give more
weight to functional links that are more likely to exist in
most eukaryotes. Due to limited species sampling of protein-protein interactions, in the TPPPI we included all
group relationships that had evidence in both vertebrates
and non-vertebrates.
In order to construct the negative control dataset, we
wanted to explicitly exclude potential functionally linked
gene pairs and their corresponding gene groups. We therefore built a "false negative" (FN) set of related gene pairs
based on the absence of any kind of evidence in STRING,
except functional links only supported by the phylogenetic profiling method implemented therein; if included,
these would result in an overestimation of the performance of the phylogenetic profiling methods under evaluation, due to similarities between the criteria used to build
the negative control set and to compare their profiles later.
Finally, we propagated all gene level relationships to their
respective OrthoMCL and InterPro groups with no additional restrictions.
In each analysis we generated a putative true negative set
TN (200,000 pairs). To do so, we constructed random
gene group pairs and discarded those present in the FN set
until we reached the targeted size. Note that all TP pairs
are included in the FN set, therefore TP pairs are also automatically excluded from the negative control.
We used two approaches for generating random pair samples: based on a weighted and unweighted group random
pair generator. In the unweighted approach, resulting in
the pair set TNUW, each group has the same probability of
being picked, whereas the weighted approach gives a
weight to each group proportional to the number of gene
members, resulting in the pair set TNW. The motivation
behind using a parallel weighted approach is the noticeable bias in the orthologous and domain level group sizes
found in the TP sets in comparison with unweighted
TNUW sets. In order to generate positive predictive value
(PPV) plots, we estimated the real proportion of TP group
pairs using the number of unweighted random pairs
rejected because they were found in the FN set.

Results and Discussion
A total of six phylogenetic profiling approaches described
in Methods were tested based on the positive and negative
datasets of functionally linked genes or gene groups.
These included two methods based on the traditional
presence-absence profiles of individual genes: a full species phylogeny based method (DPCP) and a computationally efficient heuristic method (WRUNS). In addition,
four different gene group size approaches were tested
resulting from the combination of two methods to infer
ancestral gene group sizes (parsimony and gene tree) and
two methods to evaluate the significance of the co-evolutionary signal (GSCOR and GSHGT). A summary of the
methods and abbreviations used is shown in Table 2.
Sensitivity of presence-absence profiling at the
orthologous group level
We first applied the traditional presence-absence profiling
methods, here represented by DPCP and WRUNS, to the
test set of OrthoMCL orthologous groups. The goal was
then to correctly predict known relationships extracted
from the STRING database, namely co-presence in pathways (TPCoPW) or protein-protein interactions (TPPPI). To
measure the overall sensitivity of the methods, we initially
defined a single global p-value or score threshold for each
method using the distribution of values observed in the
negative control sets at the typical standard type-I error
level of 5% (i.e. 95% specificity).

The first two columns in Table 3 show the resulting sensitivities. DPCP is more sensitive with a maximum of 20.7%
true positives versus 14.9% for WRUNS on the TPCoPW test
set, using TNUW as a negative control. Similar results are
obtained for TPPPI with sensitivities of 17.5% and 13.7%
respectively. Using the weighted negative control, TNW,
the two approaches achieve more similar but slightly
lower sensitivities (Table 3). Thus, in this case, we conclude that the negative test set sampling approach has little effect on the sensitivity estimates.
The corresponding ROC curves (Figure 4 pink and yellow), which plot sensitivity versus specificity, show that
these methods are better than random classifiers especially in the region of high scoring cases (inset diagrams).
Nevertheless, both presence-absence profiling approaches
sometimes fall just above or below the diagonal, generally
showing a poorer performance on the PPI positive set
compared to the CoPW set. This is due to a considerable
percentage of profile pairs that do not exhibit enough variability or number of genetic events (information content), resulting in an elevated number of degenerated
maximum and non-significant p-values (= 1) that affect
CoPW and PPI (especially the latter).

Sensitivity of group size based profiling approaches at the
orthologous group level
Since the OrthoMCL orthologous groups may contain a
variable number of paralogs for each species, group size
based approaches are also applicable in this scenario.
Accordingly, we also evaluated their sensitivity using the
same procedure as for the presence-absence profiling
methods (Table 3). In order to calculate empirical thresholds, we only considered group pairs with a minimum
number of 10 common branches that have undergone a
group size expansion or contraction, since lack of either
group size variability across species or phylogenetic
spread renders a considerable number of profile pairs
unsuitable for this purpose.

The ancestral gene group size reconstruction using Parsimony also yielded results better than a random classifier
based on the ROC curves (Figure 4, light blue and dark
blue). They were roughly equal to or inferior to presenceabsence methods in the high selectivity region close to the
origin of the axes with the exception of the TPPPI using
unweighted negative test set sampling (zoomed in insets
in Figure 4). Using GSCORPars, the observed sensitivities
are higher than with GSHGTPars (Table 3).
In contrast, the gene tree based reconstructions achieved
in general a better sensitivity, closer to that achieved by
DPCP on the TPCoPW test set and with a noticeable
improvement on the TPPPI set using both GSHGT and
GSCOR. GSCORGeneT achieves an more than 2 fold
increase using the unweighted negative set sampling
(37.9% versus 17.5%). Also the corresponding ROC
curves (Figure 4, light green and dark green) are the ones
closest to the ideal classifier, indicating that these methods seem to perform better overall (Figure 4A-D).
Sensitivity at the domain sharing and gene family level
In a second experiment, we applied the same analyses to
coarser groups of genes from the InterPro dataset (see
Methods). These groups are clearly more extensive in
comparison with OrthoMCL groups, with a 5 fold larger
mean group size (Table 1). A larger number of members

allows a greater group size variability across extant and
ancestral gene groups, and thus a larger number of
informative tree branches that have undergone group size
expansions or contractions.
It is worth noting that the weighted negative pair sampling generates a staggering 49% pairs present in the FN
profile pair set (see Methods). In other words, if two genes
are chosen at random, there is nearly a 50% chance that
they contain some functionally related protein domains
(i.e. at least one functionally linked protein pair contains
these domains). This is not surprising if one considers that
even assuming an unrealistic random intergenic functional network, larger gene groups would have an increasing chance to exhibit some direct or indirect functional
link through some of its members.
Although presence-absence profiling is not appropriate
for coarse gene clusters (since most positions are 1), we
applied DPCP and WRUNS to these two datasets in order
to compare their performance with gene group size based
approaches. Presence-absence profiling clearly loses overall sensitivity when applied to coarse gene groups (Table
4). Moreover, their sensitivity does not even reach the
designed type-I error for the prediction of PPI relationships using the InterPro groups. This confirms that presence-absence profiling is less useful at this group
granularity level, although it still does better than a random classifier on the CoPW positive profile pair set.
In contrast, using the group size based approaches, the
sensitivity remains equal or increased with coarser clusters
of genes. The only exception is the gene tree reconstruction with the hypergeometric test (GSHGTGeneT) for the
prediction of CoPW relationships, where sensitivity
slightly decreased (approx. 2% less). The maximum sensitivity achieved is as high as 63.7% for the prediction of PPI
using the InterPro groups and the unweighted negative
control sampling to calculate thresholds.
The corresponding ROC curves are consistent with these
results (Figure 5A-D). These show an appreciable decrease

in performance of the presence-absence profiling methods compared to the results obtained with the OrthoMCL
groups (see Figure 4), especially for the prediction of PPI
positive pairs. The group size based approaches using parsimony reconstruction (light blue and dark blue curves)
improve considerably in most cases (except for CoPW predictions using weighted negative sampling), in contrast to
the gene tree based reconstruction (light green and dark
green curves) that only results in a noticeable improvement for the PPI predictions.
Effect of information content on sensitivity and false
positive rates
To evaluate to what extent information content (IC)may
have an impact on the performance of the different meth-

ods, we plotted sensitivity, or true positive rate (TPR), and
false positive rates (FPR) at a standard type-I error level of
5% against a measure of profile pair IC (described in
Methods) (Figure 6). All approaches show better performance for the prediction of PPI compared to CoPW relationships. Moreover, the sensitivity is in most cases higher
than the FPR, although the ratio between the two quantities is lower using the group size methods.
For the gene presence-absence methods applied to
OrthoMCL groups (Figure 6A), the sensitivity increases
steadily with increasing IC clearly above the FPR. Both
DPCP and WRUNS achieved similar performances at the
same IC levels. The sensitivity is clearly higher for the prediction of PPI compared to the CoPW dataset. At the 5%

the right column (D-F) corresponds to InterPro groups. The top row (A and D) shows results using presence-absence profiling
approaches, the middle row (B and E) represents group size approaches using the hypergeometric test (GSHGT), and the bottom row (C and F) corresponds group size approaches using the Kendall-t correlation index (GSCOR). Results for WRUNS

Thus the first two represent sensitivity or true positive rate (TPR) whereas the second two indicate FPR using alternative negative control sampling approaches. Sensitivity, FPR and IC frequency distributions are smoothed by considering neighbouring
data points along the y-axis (radius 2) with equal weights. Data points with less than 10 observations are not shown.

type I error level, sensitivity exceeds 50% in the highest
informativeness regions. In contrast, the FPR barely
reaches 10% under the same conditions, thus resulting in
an approximate 5 fold ratio between sensitivity and FPR.
For the group size based approaches (Figure 6B and 6C),
the parsimony ancestral size reconstruction apparently
results in lower IC (measured by the number of branches
that exhibit expansion or contraction in both profiles
simultaneously). Nevertheless this observation is not by
itself a clear indicator of the overall performance superiority of the gene tree based reconstruction. At best, for the
parsimony reconstruction with the hypergeometric test
(GSHGTpars), FPR reaches values as high as 30% with a
contrasting sensitivity that only occasionally surpassed
the 40% mark (Figure 6B). Using gene tree based reconstruction, these figures reached 35-40% and 65-70%
respectively. In general, sensitivity vs FPR in group size
based approaches does not go far beyond the 2 fold mark.
In contrast, the correlation based approach (GSCOR)
using either parsimony or gene tree based ancestral group
size reconstruction does not show such a clear distinction
graphically between CoPW positive and negative control
sets specially using gene tree reconstruction (Figure 6C).
The performance is slightly better for PPI positives.
The sensitivity and FPR of the methods applied to InterPro
groups (Figure 6D-F) are very similar to the plots obtained
using OrthoMCL groups from a qualitative point of view.
Nevertheless there is a clear loss of sensitivity in presenceabsence methods at this group level (Figure 6A and 6D).
The differences between the group size based approach
curves (Figure 6B vs E and C vs F) are mainly due to differences in the IC ranges and thresholds used.
Effect of information content heterogeneity
In order to investigate the IC ranges for the profile pairs in
each of the test sets, we plotted the relative profile pair IC
frequency distribution along the x-axis (violin plots under
each diagram in Figure 6). In all approaches and gene
group granularities, the regions with high frequency in the
positive profile pair test set do not match the maximum
sensitivity (always associated with high IC). This seems to
be the main factor that limits profiling performance.
Additionally, the profile pair distribution across IC levels
is clearly different between the positive and negative datasets in each possible combination of profiling methodology and gene group granularity. Using presence-absence
profiling, the positive set frequencies are shifted towards
low IC in contrast to the negative control set frequencies,
whereas this trend is reversed using group size
approaches. This may explain the contrasting performance of presence-absence profiling and group size based
profiling within and across different gene group clustering
granularities.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/383

In the case of presence-absence profiling, most PPI links
are found in the region with less informative profile pairs
especially in the InterPro gene group positive test set (Figure 6D). Thus, despite the fact that sensitivity is generally
higher when compared to CoPW positive pairs and that
PPI functional links should exhibit a stronger interdependence, this type of profiling performs worse in practice
(Tables 3 and 4).
These results suggest that we could aim to improve functional link prediction accuracy by using alternative grouping criteria that maximize IC. For example, previous
studies in prokaryotes and eukaryotes indicate a gain in
performance when considering several similarity thresholds [13,39] as opposed to a single gene clustering criterion. However altering granularity in order to increase the
chance of detection by optimising IC may render the
results less amenable to interpretation, as cluster boundaries may not correlate with clear biologically interpretable
gene groups (e.g. orthologous groups, gene families,
shared domains, gene ontology clusters and so forth).
Alternatively, profile pairs could be sorted based on IC for
further investigation using potentially more accurate but
computationally demanding approaches, such as maximum-likelihood based methods [5]. This would avoid
running computationally demanding analyses on profile
pairs with low IC that a priori are much less likely to show
any evidence of coevolution.
Score adjustment based on information content
In view of the differences in information content (IC) distributions for the positive and negative test sets, even
when using weighted negative sampling, we reassessed
the performance of the different approaches after correcting for IC heterogeneity on a case by case basis. Taking
TNW as a control and using a kernel fit, we estimated the
conditional probability distribution of the scores given
the IC under the null hypothesis that gene groups are not
functionally related: Pr(score|ICij). Then, the scores were
converted to adjusted p-values equal to the probability of
obtaining a score equal to or greater than the observed
score given the IC found in the pair. The resulting profile
pair p-values should more accurately reflect our confidence in the prediction of co-evolution of the corresponding gene groups. The plots on the right-hand size in
Figures 4 and 5 show the adjusted ROC curves next to
their non-adjusted counterparts using unweighed and
weighted negative sampling (left and middle plots respectively) and Table 5 shows the sensitivity estimates at the
type-I error level of 5% (p-value <= 0.05) for the ICadjusted p-values.

Our results indicate a decrease in the performance of the
gene group size based approaches using IC corrected p-

values, while the performance estimate of the presenceabsence approaches remains relatively unchanged compared to the single empirical threshold approach. The parsimony reconstruction based analyses are the most
affected by the adjustment, particularly when applied to
the InterPro datasets, where sensitivities that were previously estimated to be as high as 34% percent (Table 4)
decrease to around 10% or lower (Table 5). All in all, the
group size based approaches seem to lose most of the
advantage they had with respect to presence-absence profiling when the co-evolutionary signal is measured objectively based on the IC of the profile pair. In other words,
we overestimate the performance of gene group based
approaches unless, either the profile pair scores are
adjusted for IC, or the statistical differences between the
positive and the negative control test sets accurately reflect
the properties of the real world data.
Thus, the typical approach of generating unweighted random pairs to build a negative dataset and a single cut-off
value results in a very clear overestimation of the accuracy
of gene group size approaches. Performance improvement using this strategy does not seem to be founded on
a real gain of co-evolutionary signal as much as statistical
biases due to heterogeneous distribution of informativeness between positive and negative control groups. Jothi
and colleagues [10] made an important remark on the
importance of a careful selection of the null hypothesis in
order to avoid spurious results due to profile heterogeneity. They focused their discussion on the effect introduced
by combined analyses of profiles with different phylogenetic spread. The adoption of species tree aware
approaches, such as the ones used in this study, together
with the restriction of considering only groups that are
present on both sides of the root of the tree, should reduce
these biases. Nevertheless, differences may still remain
and can result in artefactual detection of functional relationships between gene groups.
It should be noted however that the inability to distinguish between putative functionally linked and unrelated
pairs may result in part from the difficulties in obtaining
a pure negative control dataset totally devoid of function-

ally linked groups. For instance, weighted negative sampling generates a high proportion of false negatives: 49%.
Moreover, the functional network resulting from the clustering of genes into coarse groups is inevitably very condensed, with most genes connected by one or only a few
direct functional links (Table 1). Arguably, we should
expect to see at least some weak co-evolution between
groups that are found close together in the network (i.e.
most random pairs).
Other sources of bias in phylogenetic profiling analyses
For all the methods tested here, the FPR increases for high
information content levels. This trend is more pronounced in the group size based approaches and especially when using non-partial correlation corrected
coefficients (GSCOR). Previous studies using permutation
and simulations have already shown that heterogeneous
genome size can affect the outcome of co-evolution tests
[13,14]. For example, lineages leading to larger genomes
should have a natural tendency to expansions and vice
versa. Moreover, genomic scale events, such as whole
genome duplications and major genome rearrangements,
may introduce additional background co-evolution-like
patterns for the affected gene groups that are not a consequence of true functional relationships.

In addition to genome size effects, we also found evidence
for local correlation of group size evolution mostly
between neighbouring branches of the species tree (Figure
7). Either positive or negative correlation of group size
change between phylogenetic tree branches should result
in a number of coincidental expansions and contractions
greater than that expected under the null hypothesis, due
to the fact that we conveniently (but erroneously) consider observations at different branches or profile positions as independent data points. An evolutionary
explanation for this phenomenon might be that closely
related phylogenetic lineages tend to follow a similar evolutionary pattern, resulting in positive correlation, and
that gene losses are typically preceded by gene gains,
resulting in negative correlation between ancestral and
successor branches on the tree. Branch evolutionary correlation heatmaps such as the one shown in Figure 7 could

be used to attain an optimal choice of species for phylogenetic profiling by selecting lineages resulting in a minimization of autocorrelation effects.
Phylogenetic profiling as a functional link predictor in
large-scale analyses
The positive predictive value (PPV) is a statistic of special
interest for high-throughput functional studies as it quantifies the probability that a positive test outcome is in fact
a true prediction. Figure 8 shows PPV plots against sensitivity for analyses using the OrthoMCL and InterPro
groups based on IC corrected p-values. Reasonable PPV
values (50% or greater) are only obtained at very low sensitivity, especially for the OrthoMCL gene groups (Figure
8A and 8B). This is for the most part due to the low estimated proportion of TP pairs amongst all possible pairs
(Table 1) and the fact that only a fraction of these have a
high enough IC to be tested.

Consequently, although phylogenetic profiling may be
used to unveil some functional relationships with a strong
co-evolutionary signal, it is on its own not suitable for
large-scale screening of these relationships in eukaryotes.
The PPV improves when considering coarser gene clusters
(Figure 8C and 8D), but this will lead to subsequent problems in distinguishing true functionally related gene pairs,
since the number of possible pairings grows quadratically
with the number of members of each group.
Reassessing the contribution of gene group size based
approaches
Gene group size based approaches offer an opportunity to
overcome some of the limitations of presence-absence
based methods [13,14], for example the analysis of essential gene group profiles (present in all or most species).
Nevertheless, even though these methods take in consideration a greater number of genetic events, thus increasing
information content, they are still outperformed by presence-absence in certain cases, particularly when applied to
the fine-grained OrthoMCL groups (Table 3 and 5 and
Figure 4). The most plausible explanation for this is that a
total loss of a gene group, without any homologous genes
left to perform at least part of its biological role, has a
much greater impact than losing or gaining some gene
"copies". Thus, common gene group pair co-expansions
or co-contractions that do not result in a total gain or loss
of the homologous groups under consideration provide
less compelling evidence of co-evolution and may introduce noise.

Despite this lack of resolution, the fact that the sensitivity
values are typically above the FPR curves (Figure 6) is a
clear indicator that these scores are positively correlated
with true functional relatedness. Consequently, although
group size based approaches may not perform that well in

comparison with neighbouring lineages on the species tree.

classifying pairs as related or unrelated, they may still be
appropriate for defining functional distances between
groups and also perhaps for clustering them in functional
modules. In any case, high scoring pairs are likely to be
true functionally linked groups [13,14]. However, it is
preferable to use adjusted scores determined, for example,
by the kernel approach described in Methods in order to
avoid an over-representation of cases with high IC due to
their inherently higher non-adjusted scores.
Gene trees improve the performance of gene group size
change approaches
In an attempt to improve the performance of gene group
size based methods, we used gene trees to reconstruct
ancestral gene group sizes. This resulted in a clear
improvement compared to parsimony reconstruction.
Gene trees can map more precisely gene duplications and
losses to branches of the species tree using the evolutionary information present in the gene sequences. The total

or alternative genetic event types that may also co-occur
between co-evolving groups of genes.

number of genetic events inferred is approximately 9 fold
the number recovered using parsimony. Moreover, multiple losses and gains can be simultaneously detected on the
same branch, whereas parsimony can only infer an optimal number of gene losses or duplications depending on
the sign of the size change on that branch. Consequently,
the number of branches with expansions and contractions
in the average profile pair is much greater using the gene
tree based reconstruction (Figure 6). Moreover, after correcting for heterogeneous IC content, the sensitivity of
gene tree based approaches is clearly greater than those
using parsimony (Table 5).

Conclusion
To summarize, our results confirm that the performance
of phylogenetic profiling methods is limited in eukaryotic
studies, an observation already made in previous studies
of presence-absence profiling [9,10]. However, several
methodological aspects beyond the scope of this article
may influence the outcome: for example different methods for orthologous group prediction, large group decomposition and alternative gene tree building methods,
different methods for species sampling or the use of other
criteria to define bona fide functionally linked group pairs

In addition to presence-absence profiling, recent work in
the field has proposed group size based approaches as an
alternative methodology that may improve performance.
Our analyses indicate that the relative performance of
both approaches is for the most part dependent on the
gene clustering granularity. While presence-absence profiling is more appropriate for fine-grained gene clusters
such as the OrthoMCL orthologous groups, we show that
the sensitivity of the group size based approaches can be
increased by using coarser clusters of genes (based on the
presence of a shared InterPro domain). In our experiments, the type of functional link affects both approaches
in the same way, since direct protein-protein interactions
(PPI) represent stronger interdependences and are generally better predicted than participation in the same KEGG
pathway, which include a wider variety of relations. We
also show that heterogeneous information content
between positive and negative control datasets influences
performance assessment. Moreover, a combination of two
frequently adopted evaluation strategies resulted in a clear
overestimation of the performance gained using group
size approaches (i) generating a negative control set that
involves random or exhaustive unweighted group pair
generation and (ii) using a single null hypothesis rejection
threshold. Here, we have proposed an alternative based
on adjusting the profile pair scores based on their information content. In this context, weighted sampling of a
negative set helps in obtaining enough cases across the
information content range to accurately approximate this
distribution with a smaller sampling.
In contrast with gene group size approaches, presenceabsence profiling always shows a better positive versus
negative classification accuracy in the face of the heterogeneous nature of the information content across profile
pair sets. This property is true for both gene clustering
granularities tested despite our efforts to improve gene
group size based approaches using gene trees to infer
ancestral group sizes. Therefore, we conclude that presence-absence profiling methods are more suitable for the
analysis of datasets where the profiles have sufficient
information content.
Nevertheless group size approaches are still useful and
provide a complementary means of detecting domain or
family level co-evolution between groups that may be elusive to presence-absence profiling approaches. Moreover
positive correlation between co-evolution scores and
functional links imply that these methods could be used
to estimate functional distances between gene groups and
to cluster them based on their functional relatedness.

Finally, despite the fact that this study focuses on eukaryotic genomes, we believe these observations should also
be considered in future bacterial and archeobacterial phylogenetic profiling analyses.
