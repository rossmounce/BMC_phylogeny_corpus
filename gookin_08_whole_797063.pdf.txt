Abstract
Background: The classic paradigm of heterotrimeric G-protein signaling describes a heptahelical,
membrane-spanning G-protein coupled receptor that physically interacts with an intracellular Gα
subunit of the G-protein heterotrimer to transduce signals. G-protein coupled receptors comprise
the largest protein superfamily in metazoa and are physiologically important as they sense highly
diverse stimuli and play key roles in human disease. The heterotrimeric G-protein signaling
mechanism is conserved across metazoa, and also readily identifiable in plants, but the low
sequence conservation of G-protein coupled receptors hampers the identification of novel ones.
Using diverse computational methods, we performed whole-proteome analyses of the three
dominant model plant species, the herbaceous dicot Arabidopsis thaliana (mouse-eared cress), the
monocot Oryza sativa (rice), and the woody dicot Populus trichocarpa (poplar), to identify plant
protein sequences most likely to be GPCRs.
Results: Our stringent bioinformatic pipeline allowed the high confidence identification of
candidate G-protein coupled receptors within the Arabidopsis, Oryza, and Populus proteomes. We
extended these computational results through actual wet-bench experiments where we tested
over half of our highest ranking Arabidopsis candidate G-protein coupled receptors for the ability
to physically couple with GPA1, the sole Gα in Arabidopsis. We found that seven out of eight tested
candidate G-protein coupled receptors do in fact interact with GPA1. We show through G-protein
coupled receptor classification and molecular evolutionary analyses that both individual G-protein
coupled receptor candidates and candidate G-protein coupled receptor families are conserved
across plant species and that, in some cases, this conservation extends to metazoans.
Conclusion: Our computational and wet-bench results provide the first step toward
understanding the diversity, conservation, and functional roles of plant candidate G-protein
coupled receptors.

Background

The ability to sense the environment and respond appropriately is a crucial factor for organism survival. One of the primary sensing mechanisms used by metazoans involves Gprotein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling cascades. These
cascades are composed of, at the most simplistic level, a
plasma membrane localized stimulus-sensing GPCR that
transduces the extracellular signal to an intracellular heterotrimeric G-protein complex, thereby activating downstream
signaling cascades. Because GPCR sequence conservation
even within a single GPCR family of an organism can be lower
than 25% [1], GPCRs are identified not by sequence homology
but rather by their ability to couple with an intracellular heterotrimeric G-protein α subunit and by their two-dimensional topology, which classically consists of an extracellular
amino terminus, seven membrane spanning domains connected by three intracellular and three extracellular loops,
and an intracellularly located carboxy-terminal tail.
Signaling from the exterior of the cell is initiated when the
GPCR becomes activated by ligand binding, stimulating an
exchange of guanosine diphosphate for guanosine triphosphate on the Gα subunit, and a subsequent dissociation of the
heterotrimer into Gα and a βγ subunit dimer. Gα and the βγ
dimer then proceed to initiate downstream signaling cascades
[2,3].
GPCRs comprise the largest class of transmembrane signaling molecules present in metazoan organisms and have been
shown to recognize ligands and effectors such as photons,
ions, nucleotides, amino acids, peptides, glycoproteins, hormones and lipids [4,5]. Although GPCRs appear to be strictly
limited to the eukaryota, they are ubiquitous and have been
cloned from a wide range of evolutionarily distant organisms,
including yeast [6], coral [7], nematodes [8], arthropods [9],
human [10], and even from the preserved DNA of the woolly
mammoth [11]. GPCRs play central roles in processes as
diverse as yeast mating and insect taste perception [12], and
in mammals, GPCR signaling plays critical roles in development and metabolism. Aberrant mammalian GPCR activity
has been directly linked to such maladies as blindness,
asthma, heart disease, obesity, and cancer [13,14].
Whole genome sequencing efforts have shown that heterotrimeric G-protein signaling can be highly complex. The
human proteome is known to contain 23 Gα, 5 Gβ, and 12 Gγ
subunits [15], leading to over 1,300 theoretical heterotrimeric
complexes. Factoring in the over 850 predicted human
GPCRs [16], many of which are known to homo- and heterodimerize [17], the number of potential signaling pathways
becomes enormous. In sharp contrast, the number of known
heterotrimeric signaling complex components in plants is
dramatically less. The fully sequenced model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has only one canonical Gα subunit (GPA1), one
Gβ subunit (AGB1), and two identified Gγ subunits (AGG1
and AGG2) [18,19]. Arabidopsis also has a single regulator of

Volume 9, Issue 7, Article R120

Gookin et al. R120.2

G-protein signaling (RGS) protein (RGS1), which has been
shown to directly accelerate the intrinsic guanosine triphosphatase activity of Gα [20]. Interestingly, RGS1 contains a
heptahelical domain as well as an RGS box domain, and
might also function as a receptor or co-receptor [21]. For the
past decade there has been only one putative GPCR (GCR1)
identified and experimentally investigated in Arabidopsis
[22-25]. Recently, a new GPCR, GCR2, has been reported in
Arabidopsis [26], although this protein sequence does not
appear to have the canonical seven transmembrane (TM)
topology of known GPCRs and some discrepancies exist
regarding its purported plant hormone signaling function
[27]. Thus, the question that arises, and which is the focus of
the present study, is whether the Arabidopsis genome is as
depauperate of GPCRs as it is of heterotrimeric G-protein
subunits, or whether additional Arabidopsis GPCRs exist that
have not yet been identified. In other words, given that Arabidopsis has only one canonical Gα subunit and one canonical
Gβ subunit [28,29], and only two identified Gγ subunits
[30,31], is it reasonable that GCR1, and potentially RGS1, are
the only candidate GPCRs in Arabidopsis, or are there other
as yet undiscovered candidate GPCRs? The large number of
plant responses that are affected upon genetic knockout of
GPA1, AGB1, AGG1, or AGG2 [32,33] suggests that the latter
hypothesis may prove true.
The great physiological importance of GPCRs, combined with
the ever-increasing availability of nucleic acid sequence data,
has prompted the development and use of bioinformatic tools
to predict and identify new GPCRs. Using both functionally
characterized GPCRs and their predicted sequence homologs
as a starting point, new predicted GPCRs have been identified
and shown to be plentiful in a broad range of organisms from
slime molds to humans [16]. Analyses based on sequence conservation are useful for identifying GPCRs that are highly
similar to known GPCRs, but the low sequence conservation
within the GPCR superfamily, and even within each GPCR
family, limits this approach. To circumvent this problem,
more comprehensive bioinformatic methods have been
developed to identify and characterize potential GPCRs.
More than ten bioinformatic programs designed to identify
transmembrane domains are publicly available, and programs such as TMHMM2 [34] and HMMTOP2 [35,36], and
Phobius [37,38] can be used to identify sequences with the
classic 7TM domain topology of GPCRs. In a comparative
study, Cuthbertson et al. [39] found TMHMM2 and
HMMTOP2 to consistently perform better than other programs, and Phobius was reported to perform comparably
[38]. To attain greater accuracy in the number of predicted
TMs, signal peptide prediction programs such as Phobius and
Signal-P [40] can be used in conjunction with dedicated TM
prediction programs, since TM domain predictors alone have
a tendency to mistakenly predict signal peptides as aminoterminal transmembrane domains [41-43].

At the level of directly predicting a sequence as a GPCR there
are only a few prediction methods available, and the diversity
in their approach is an indicator of the difficulty of this task.
The quasi-periodic feature classifier (QFC) developed by Kim
et al. [44] maps statistical values derived from protein
sequence attributes into an n-dimensional feature space and
classifies the query sequence as either a GPCR or a non-GPCR
through the use of a discriminate function. The QFC relies on
four parameters for classification: amino acid usage index;
log of the average periodicity of the hydrophobicity function;
log of average periodicity of the polarity scale; and variance of
the first derivative of the polarity scale. Notably, the QFC has
been used successfully to identify Drosophila odorant and
gustatory receptors [45,46] and Anopheles odorant receptors
[47].
The GPCRHMM [48] prediction method is based on variances in amino acid composition and topological segment
lengths between GPCR families. While not explicitly predicting a 7TM topology, GPCRHMM describes the typical 7TM
topology by creating different hidden state compartments to
model each of the three extracellular segments, the three
intracellular segments, and the seven transmembrane segments that connect them. The amino and carboxyl termini are
additionally broken into two compartments (close to the
membrane and globular) and the distal amino-terminal compartment also includes a signal peptide model. GPCRHMM
also includes a secondary filter that takes sequences passing
the global prediction model and re-analyzes the central core
7TM region of the query using only the corresponding local
compartment models in order to reduce the number of false
positives arising from amino acid composition bias derived
from long amino and carboxyl termini.
Recently, Moriyama et al. [49] combined the alignment free
methods of discriminant function analyses, support vector
machines, and partial least squares regression (LDA, QDA,
KNN, SVM-AA, SVM-di, and PLS-ACC) to identify a preliminary list of 652 Arabidopsis candidate 7TM receptors. This
initial list was reduced by filtering with HMMTOP2 [36] to
tentatively identify 394 putative 7TM receptor proteins
(7TMpRs) with 5-10 predicted TM domains. A subsequent
requirement of exactly seven predicted TM domains and an
extracellular amino terminus identified 54 non-redundant
proteins as 7TMpRs. This prediction method has not been
challenged in biological experiments in order to determine if
the predicted GPCRs actually couple to a Gα subunit.
In our work we use a combination of direct GPCR prediction
methods, multiple TM domain prediction analyses, and signal peptide prediction to identify and rank candidate GPCRs
in the Arabidopsis proteome. Once potential candidate
GPCRs have been identified in a proteome, it is possible to
classify them using software such as the four level classifier
GPCRsIdentifier [50], which classifies GPCRs as belonging to
GPCR superfamily, family, sub-family, and sub-family types

Volume 9, Issue 7, Article R120

Gookin et al. R120.3

based on amino acid composition and dipeptide frequencies.
Beyond classification, candidate GPCRs can be characterized
using coupling specificity prediction software such as PredCouple 2 [51], which predicts the type of Gα subunit with
which the candidate GPCR should physically interact. We further characterize our candidate GPCRs by using GPCRsIdentifier to classify our candidate plant GPCRs and Pred-Couple
2 to predict their coupling specificity. We also show evidence
for evolutionary conservation of our identified candidate
GPCRs using the fully sequenced genomes of rice (Oryza
sativa) and poplar (Populus trichocarpa), and search the
Pfam database [52] to investigate domain similarities. Most
importantly, we also provide positive results from in vivo protein-protein coupling assays between some of our highest
ranking Arabidopsis candidate GPCRs and the sole Gα subunit in Arabidopsis, thus confirming the efficacy of our bioinformatic scheme for identifying novel, divergent GPCRs.

Results
Identification of candidate GPCRs in Arabidopsis
Due to the low sequence similarity of GPCRs, alternative
methods beyond BLAST are required to identify novel
GPCRs. Because the QFC algorithm was reported to have an
approximately 98% success rate in classifying GPCRs from
non-GPCRs [44], and GPCRs are classically described by
their 7TM topology, our criterion to identify a protein
sequence as a candidate GPCR comprises the requirements of
direct prediction as a GPCR by the QFC algorithm and the
presence of exactly seven TM domains as predicted by at least
two of the three TM prediction programs used (TMHMM2,
HMMMTOP2, and Phobius) after correction for signal peptide misprediction (Figure 1).
We identified 2,469 Arabidopsis proteins that satisfied the
QFC requirement (Figure 1). To predict proteins containing
seven TM domains, we performed whole proteome analyses
with the dedicated TM prediction programs TMHMM2 and
HMMTOP2, and the signal peptide/TM domain co-prediction program Phobius. The mature proteins of sequences with
signal peptides detected by Phobius were subsequently reanalyzed by TMHMM2 and HMMTOP2 (Figure 2a). A total of
401 non-redundant protein sequences were predicted to have
seven TM domains by at least one of the three programs and
83 were predicted to have seven TM domains by all three. We
identified 178 proteins that satisfied our '2/3 predictions' rule
for the presence of exactly seven TM domains (Figure 2a).
The intersecting set of these 178 proteins with the 2,469 proteins identified by QFC analysis contains 127 candidate
GPCRs, which we call the 'intermediate pool'; of these, 71 are
predicted to have exactly seven TM domains by all three TM
domain predictors (Figure 1; Additional data file 1).
From this intermediate pool of 127 proteins, we designated a
sequence as a high ranking candidate GPCR if it also satisfied
the criterion of prediction as a GPCR by GPCRHMM using the

relaxed global threshold of -10. Because GPCRHMM appears
to have high specificity for selecting GPCRs, and it has been
reported that reducing the GPCRHMM global cutoff threshold to as low as -53 still allows GPCRHMM to function with a
false positive rate of only approximately 1% when analyzing
data sets composed of proteins containing 6-8TMs [48], we
chose to use the relaxed global threshold of -10 in order to

select more divergent GPCR candidates while still minimizing
the number of false positives. Whole Arabidopsis proteome
analysis by GPCRHMM using this threshold identified a nonredundant set of 99 sequences (Figure 1). Of these 99
sequences, 16 also satisfied the prediction criteria from our
QFC and 7TM analyses; thus, we designated these 16 as 'high
ranking' candidate GPCRs (Figure 1; Table 1), while the

remaining 111 proteins from the intermediate pool were designated as second tier GPCR candidates. Further filtering of
the 16 sequences through the use of a stricter global threshold
in combination with a local GPCRHMM filter, namely a
GPCRHMM global filter threshold level of 0 and a positive
GPCRHMM local score, identified 11 of the 16 candidates as
belonging to an upper bin within the set of high ranking candidate GPCRs (Table 1).

Empirical testing of Arabidopsis candidate GPCR Gαcoupling ability
Although the identification of candidate GPCRs by bioinformatic means is informative, the validity of the predictions can
only be determined empirically. One obvious criterion that
GPCR proteins should logically satisfy is that they should
physically interact with a G-protein α subunit. As wet-bench
evaluation of such protein-protein interactions is not a trivial
task, we chose half of our Arabidopsis high ranking candidate
GPCRs for in vivo analysis, and did so using additional information beyond our initial criteria of direct GPCR prediction
and TM domain analysis.

Twelve of the sixteen high ranking candidate GPCR
sequences were predicted to have seven TM domains by all
three methods (Table 1), with ten of the consensus 7TM proteins found within the eleven member upper bin. Two of the
upper bin consensus 7TM predictions (Cand6, At5g02630.1;
Cand7, At5g18520.1) are only apparent after removal of the

Candidates Cand2 and Cand8 were chosen based on their
limited similarity to GPR175, a mammalian GPCR. Heptahelical protein 2 (HHP2) was selected for analysis since the HHP
family shows similarity to the atypical GPCRs of the human
adiponectin receptor and membrane progestin receptor family [53]. The Tobamovirus replication protein TOM1 sequence
was selected for analysis since both TOM1 and TOM3 were
shown to be essential for tobamovirus pathogenicity in Arabidopsis [54] and mammalian GPCRs are essential for HIV
pathogenesis [55]. Two of the splice variant products encoded
by the At3g59090 locus (Cand3 and Cand5) were chosen
based on the fact that they differ primarily in their amino-terminal regions and both are annotated as being similar to
TOM1. Our BLAST analyses show that Cand3 and Cand5 have
only limited similarity to TOM1 or TOM3, with BLAST e-values ranging between e-12 and e-07 (data not shown).
A high proportion of GPCRs, especially class A GPCRs, are
known to be intronless [56], and this information was used to
select Cand1 and Cand7 instead of other candidates that, like
Cand1 and Cand7, are also annotated only as expressed proteins. Additional support for selecting Cand7 came from
domain prediction analyses using the conserved domain
database at NCBI, which indicated that Cand7 has a Lung
7TM receptor domain with a query e-value of 3.1e-35.

Protein sequences predicted to be GPCRs by QFC and GPCRHMM are indicated by an asterisk and the GPCRHMM global score is provided for
sequences we identify as GPCRs using a relaxed cutoff threshold score of -10. The predicted number of transmembrane domains and the
intracellular (in) or extracellular (out) localization of the amino terminus are shown. Pcut-T and Pcut-H describe topology predictions of the mature
proteins by TMHMM and HMMTOP, respectively, after in silico cleavage at the signal peptide cleavage site predicted by Phobius. Candidates shown to
interact with GPA1 in vivo using the split-ubiquitin system are identified in bold while the sole negative result from that assay is shown in italics.
‡GCR1 interaction with GPA1 in the split-ubiquitin system was previously described by Pandey and Assmann [60]. †RGS1 interaction with GPA1 in
the split-ubiquitin system was previously described by Chen et al. [20]; the RGS1 sequence was truncated at the upstream border of the RGS box
prior to analysis by GPCRHMM.

After choosing these candidates, we applied the split-ubiquitin system to test their ability to interact with GPA1, the sole
canonical G-protein α subunit of Arabidopsis. The split-ubiquitin system variant of the yeast two hybrid assay is based on
the ability of the amino-terminal (Nubwt) and carboxy-terminal (Cub) domains of ubiquitin to spontaneously reassemble
and become a functionally recognized target for ubiquitin
specific proteases, which cleave an artificial transcription factor, PLV, that is fused downstream of Cub (Figure 3a). PLV
translocation to the nucleus and subsequent induction of
reporter gene expression leads to functional complementation of auxotrophic yeast and positive interactions are easily
visualized through yeast growth. Protein-protein interaction
test assays are possible through the use of NubG, a mutant
version of Nubwt that has reduced affinity for Cub; thus, a
functional ubiquitin is reassembled only if the two test proteins (in our case, a candidate GPCR and GPA1) interact.
Increased assay stringency is achieved by modulating test
protein expression levels through the application of methionine, which downregulates the methionine repressible Met25
promoter that drives Cub fusion protein expression. In our
split-ubiquitin system assays we separately fused the Nubwt
and NubG domains to both the amino terminus and carboxyl

terminus of the candidate GPCR and tested the ability of these
fusion proteins to interact with the GPA1-Cub-PLV fusion
protein (Figure 3b,c, sectors 1-4). Fusion with the Nubwt is a
positive control that should always yield protein-protein
interaction. Because the fusion of additional protein sequence
can cause physiochemical changes in protein structure and
loss of function, we also performed the reciprocal assay in
which the Nub domains were fused to GPA1, and the candidate GPCR was fused to Cub-PLV (Figure 3c, sectors 5-8).
The two reciprocal assays were performed on the same
methionine supplemented media plate (Figure 3c). Since a
lack of yeast growth indicates a lack of protein-protein interaction, all interaction assay cultures were simultaneously verified as capable of growing on minimal media alone (data not
shown). All of the positive interactions, as determined by
yeast growth due to complementation of the his3 mutation,
were also accompanied by the expected color change of the
diploid yeast due to complementation of the ade2 mutation
(data not shown).
Figure 3d illustrates one positive result, while Figure 3e illustrates the sole negative result from our tests of candidate
GPCRs. As shown in sector 2 of Figure 3d, the candidate

showing a simplified outline of the split-ubiquitin system assay: protein A is fused to the amino-terminal half of ubiquitin as an amino- or carboxy-terminal

yeast growth. (b) Cartoon detailing the control (Nubwt) and test (NubG) fusion protein construct orientations for sectors 1-4 in (c). (c) Schematic
depicting the organization of the interaction assay plates in (d,e). The X represents the candidate GPCR open reading frame (ORF). Sectors 5-8 show the
reciprocal assay. (d,e) Representative results for the ability of candidate GPCRs to interact with GPA1, the Gα subunit, on 1 mM methionine repression
media. Diploid yeast containing GPA1 fusion constructs and either candidate Cand5 (d) or TOM1 (e) fusion constructs both grow on minimal media (not
shown), but Cand5 specifically interacts with GPA1 and allows growth on the repression media (d, boxed sector) while TOM1 does not (e, boxed sector).

GPCR Cand5 interacts with GPA1 as shown by the presence of
yeast growth; however, this interaction does not occur when
the Cand5 protein has a carboxy-terminal NubG or Cub
fusion protein (Figure 3d, sectors 4, 6 and 8), consistent with
the known importance of GPCR carboxyl termini in binding
G-proteins as well as other GPCR interacting proteins [57]. As
shown in Figure 3e, sectors 2, 4, 6 and 8 all lack yeast growth,
demonstrating that this candidate GPCR, TOM1, does not
interact with GPA1 regardless of the orientation of the fusion
proteins.
Our complete results, summarized in Table 2, demonstrate
that seven of the eight candidate GPCRs we tested indeed
interact with GPA1. All of the positive control interactions
using Nubwt-candidate fusion proteins showed heavy yeast
growth, as expected. Fusion proteins made using Cand1, 2, 3,
5, 7, 8 and HHP2 in the NubG-candidate orientation interacted with the GPA1-Cub-PLV fusion protein as indicated by
yeast growth (Table 2). The NubG TOM1 fusion protein did
not interact with GPA1-Cub-PLV in our highly stringent conditions with 1 mM methionine (Figure 3e), nor did it show any
interaction when the methionine concentration was reduced
five-fold to 200 μM (data not shown). None of the test assays
involving candidate-NubG constructs showed any interaction

with GPA1, while all of the control assays showed heavy yeast
growth except the assay involving HHP2, which did not show
any growth (Table 2). From these data we can conclude that a
free carboxyl terminus is required for Cand1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8
to interact with GPA1.
All of the reciprocal interaction assays using the GPA1 Nub
fusion proteins and the candidate-Cub-PLV fusion protein
were negative, while all of the control assays involving either
the Nubwt-GPA1 or the GPA1-Nubwt fusion proteins were positive except Cand8 (Table 3). Taken together, the results from
the reciprocal assays provide further evidence that a free carboxyl terminus is required for candidate GPCR interaction
with GPA1. Because the interaction of GPA1-Nubwt and
Cand8-Cub-PLV did not show any yeast growth, the negative
results for interaction between GPA1-NubG and Cand8-CubPLV are inconclusive (Table 3).

Classification of our Arabidopsis high ranking candidate
GPCRs
Although GPCRs are highly divergent and generally have low
sequence similarity, extensive study has led to the ability to
categorize metazoan GPCRs into receptor families and subfamilies, and even subfamily categories [58]. Importantly,

GPCR classification systems are based on the pharmacological properties of GPCR function [58]; therefore, classification
of candidate GPCRs may give clues regarding their functional
relatedness. The comprehensive GPCR classification software
GPCRsIdentifier [50] was utilized to classify our candidate
GPCRs in order to compare classifications of plant candidate
GPCRs with those from metazoan systems.
As the GPCRsIdentifier method is independent of primary
sequence and also does not attempt to verify a query sequence
as having the typical 7TM topology of GPCRs prior to classifi-

Volume 9, Issue 7, Article R120

Gookin et al. R120.8

cation, we applied GPCRsIdentifier to proteins that we had
previously predicted to contain 7TM domains (Figure 2a).
GPCRsIdentifier was able to classify the great majority of
these proteins: 94.74% of the 7TM proteins identified by
TMHMM2, 90.56% of the 7TM proteins identified by
HMMTOP2, and 91.52% of the 7TM sequences identified by
Phobius were classifiable by GPCRsIdentifier.
We next specifically applied GPCRsIdentifier to classify our
high ranking candidate GPCRs in the Arabidopsis proteome.
All 16 of these candidates were classified as being class A
GPCRs, and 12 of these were identified as belonging to the
Olfactory subfamily (Table 4). GCR1 was the only sequence to
be classified as belonging to the Olfactory I subfamily type
category, and nine of the Olfactory classified sequences were
diversely classified into the Olfactory II subfamily type category numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, and 13. Two of the sequences
classified into the Olfactory II subfamily were classified into
the FOR-like category. The remaining four Arabidopsis high
ranking candidate GPCRs were only classified to the subfamily level: three sequences were identified as belonging to
the Peptide subfamily of class A, while one sequence was classified as belonging to the Viral subfamily of class A.

Application of our GPCR detection method to the
Oryza proteome
To identify candidate GPCRs in Oryza the same bioinformatics pipeline was applied as was used for Arabidopsis. Application of the QFC algorithm to the Oryza non-redundant
proteome identified 3,344 proteins as GPCRs. Topology predictions using TMHMM2, HMMTOP2, and Phobius identified 187 proteins that were predicted to have 7 TMs by at least
two of these programs, after considering the presence of signal peptides (Figure 2b). As summarized in Figure 4, we iden-

Arabidopsis candidate GPCRs shown to interact with GPA1 in vivo in the split-ubiquitin fusion assays are identified in bold while the sole negative
result is indicated with an asterisk. Oryza and Populus candidate GPCRs that are orthologous to one of the emboldened Arabidopsis candidates are
identified in italic type (see Table 5 for orthology details). †GCR1 and RGS1 interaction with GPA1 in the split-ubiquitin system was previously
described by Pandey and Assmann [60] and Chen et al. [20], respectively.

tified an intermediate pool of 151 non-redundant Oryza
candidate GPCRs that satisfied the criterion of direct prediction as a GPCR by the QFC algorithm and a majority 7TM
topology prediction. Sixty-seven proteins in this intermediate
pool were predicted to have exactly seven TM domains by
consensus prediction (Additional data file 2). Application of
GPCRHMM with a relaxed global threshold to the intermediate pool resulted in identification of 138 second tier candidate
GPCRs (Additional data file 2) and 13 high ranking candidate
GPCRs (Table 5). Seven of these sequences were further segregated into an upper bin of high ranking candidates using
the additional filtering steps of requiring a GPCRHMM global
score greater than 0 and a positive GPCRHMM local score
(Table 5).

Four of the thirteen high ranking candidates were predicted
to have seven TM domains by all three TM predictors,
although 7TM consensus predictions became evident for
three of the sequences (Os01g61970.1, Os03g36790.1, and
Os02g40550.1) only after considering the confounding effect
of signal peptides on amino-terminal TM domain prediction
(Table 5).

ently; Os04g36630.1 was classified as belonging to the class A
family while Os01g66190.1 was classified as belonging to the
class C family. This may indicate that these Oryza candidate
GPCRs have functionally diverged and have differential ligand specificities since GPCR classification systems are based
on pharmacological function.
Classification of the Oryza class A candidate GPCRs identified a greater diversity of subfamily representation than that
seen in the Arabidopsis analysis (Table 4). Only 5 of the 13
candidates were classified into the Olfactory subfamily and of
these, two were identified as Olfactory I family sequences.
The other three were classified into the Olfactory II subfamily
type category numbers 4, 5, and 10. Another 5 of the 13 candidates were classified into the Rhodopsin subfamily, and the

remaining 2 sequences were divided between the Peptide and
Lysosphingolipid subfamilies.

Application of our GPCR detection method to the
Populus proteome
Direct detection of potential candidate GPCRs by the QFC
algorithm identified 2,678 sequences within the non-redundant Populus proteome (Figure 5) and our protein topology
analysis identified a total of 249 protein sequences predicted
to be heptahelical by two out of the three prediction programs
(Figure 2c). The intermediate pool of Populus candidate
GPCRs, defined as those proteins that satisfied both the QFC
and majority 7TM prediction requirements, contains 202
proteins of which 96 are 7TM by prediction consensus (Additional data file 3).

Using the same GPCRHMM criteria as previously employed,
we identified 20 high ranking candidate GPCRs in the nonredundant Populus proteome (Table 6), 12 of which compose
an upper bin of candidates as they were co-predicted by the
QFC and GPCRHMM using our most stringent criteria. Of
these 20 high ranking candidate GPCRs, 16 are predicted to

and Phobius. Nine of the consensus 7TM prediction
sequences are found within the twelve sequence upper bin

and Thyrotropin (one) subfamilies. One sequence, Pop

Pop796139, was classified by GPCRsIdentifier as a globular
protein.

Protein sequences orthologous to our Arabidopsis candidate GPCRs demonstrated to interact with the Arabidopsis Gα subunit are shown in bold and
BLAST e-values are provided to support their identification (see Table 1 for additional details).

are homologous to our Arabidopsis candidate GPCRs that we
empirically demonstrated to interact with GPA1 (Tables 2 and
3). Specifically, we hypothesized that our Arabidopsis candidate GPCRs shown to interact with GPA1 should have likely
orthologs in the Oryza and Populus proteomes and that these
likely orthologs should also have been predicted as candidate
GPCRs using our most stringent identification scheme.
To evaluate the hypothesis that our Arabidopsis high ranking
candidate GPCRs shown to physically interact with GPA1
exhibit sequence conservation in higher plants, we performed
phylogenetic analyses using potential orthologs identified by
BLAST analyses of the Arabidopsis, Oryza and Populus proteomes (Figure 6). This molecular evolutionary analysis
supported both parts of our hypothesis. First, as described in
more detail below, all seven of our interacting GPCRs as well
as GCR1, previously shown to interact with GPA1 [60], indeed
have close homologs (E-values < e-60) in Oryza and Populus,
while RGS1 [20] has a close homolog only in Populus (Tables
4 and 5, Figure 6). Second, nearly all of the orthologous
sequences uncovered by phylogenetic analyses were independently predicted as GPCRs using our GPCR prediction
pipeline (Figure 6), despite differences in primary sequence,
physiochemical characteristics, and topological boundaries.

Using GCR1 as the input sequence, we identified single
homologous proteins in both the Oryza and Populus proteomes (Os06g09930.1, Pop820940), and both these proteins were among those independently predicted by our
bioinformatic pipeline as high-ranking candidates in these
proteomes. Queries using the RGS1 sequence did not identify
a homolog in the proteome of the monocot, Oryza, but did
identify a sole homologous protein in the proteome of the
dicot, Populus (Pop720911). This sole Populus RGS1 homolog
was identified as second tier candidate GPCR by our bioinformatic analysis. Further queries of publicly available databases show that GCR1 is highly conserved across the plant
kingdom, including dicots and monocots, while RGS1
sequences are highly conserved within the dicotyledonous
species (data not shown).
BLAST analyses showed that Cand1 has no homologs within
the Arabidopsis proteome, but it does have two highly similar
proteins in the Oryza proteome and three homologs in the
Populus proteome (Figure 6d), all of which we had previously
identified as high ranking candidate GPCRs. Although highly
similar sequences (BLAST < e-95) were identified in other
plant species, the identification of non-plant possible
homologs of Cand1 was limited to a single Dictyostelium pro-

Candidate GPCRs Cand2 and Cand8, which share 83% identity and compose a two gene family in Arabidopsis, identified
a similarly closely related protein pair in Populus but only
identified a single homolog in the Oryza proteome; we had
previously identified all three of these proteins as belonging
to the high ranking candidate GPCR gene sets of these proteomes. The Cand2/8 family is not only widely conserved
across monocot and dicot plant lineages, but is also conserved

Queries with all three splice variants of At3g59090 (Cand3, 4,

(Os01g54784.1) and two sequences (Pop205267, Pop551235)
in the Populus proteome (Figure 6e). BLAST analyses using
these At3g59090 splice variants did not detect any non-plant
sequences, suggesting that this family, like the TOM1/3 family with which it is weakly associated, is plant-specific.

Figure sequence alignment of the Cand2 (At3g05010.1) and Cand8 (At5g27210.1) family
Multiple7
Multiple sequence alignment of the Cand2 (At3g05010.1) and Cand8 (At5g27210.1) family. The family is widely conserved beyond the Oryza and Populus
proteomes; homologous sequences can be found in other dicotyledonous plants (grape [GenBank:CAN61534.1]), monocotyledonous plants (sorghum
[GenBank:AAM47585.1]), insects (honeybee [GenBank:XP_625021.2]), and mammals (mouse GPR175 protein [GenBank:AAH10244.1]). The long
carboxy-terminal region of the honeybee and mouse protein sequences are truncated due to the lack of any meaningful alignment beyond that shown.
Schematic above the alignment blocks indicates the 7TM topology of Cand2, as predicted by TMHMM. Blue lines, extracellular regions; blue blocks, TM
domains; red lines, intracellular regions.

The HHP family has five members in Arabidopsis and has
previously been reported to be similar to human adiponectin
and progestin receptors [53]. BLAST searches of the Oryza
and Populus proteomes using HHP2 identify five homologs in
the Oryza proteome and six homologs in the Populus proteome (Figure 6g), and all but 2 of these 11 sequences were
found by our independent GPCR candidate search.

BLAST searches using Cand6 and Cand7, which compose half
of a four gene family in Arabidopsis, identified six
homologous protein sequences in the Oryza proteome and
five in Populus. A broader BLAST analysis, using all of these
sequences as queries, showed that the Cand6/7 'super-family'
contains 29 non-redundant members within the Arabidopsis,
Oryza, and Populus proteomes. The majority of these
sequences (20/29) are independently identified by our GPCR

Genome Biology 2008,

prediction pipeline as candidate GPCRs, with 13 of the 20
sequences identified as high ranking candidate GPCRs.
Molecular evolutionary analyses using all 29 members show
that the superfamily strongly and equally bifurcates into two
clades (Additional data file 4), with one clade containing
Cand6, Cand7, and all of their close homologs identified in the
initial BLAST analyses (Figure 6f). Subsequent BLAST
searches using Cand7 as the query show that this large plant
family of sequences is similar to the human GPR107 family of
GPCRs and conserved across plants, insects, fish, and mammals (Additional data file 5 and data not shown).
To further characterize the phylogenetic relationships identified by our molecular evolutionary analyses, we queried the
Pfam database [52] using all of our candidate GPCRs (Additional data file 6). Domain search analyses using the Pfam
database confirm the previous descriptions of GCR1 having a
Dicty_CAR domain, and we find that this attribute is also
found in the Oryza and Populus homologs of GCR1 (Figure 6;
Additional data file 6). Our analyses show that the plant
Cand6/7 superfamily members all contain the Lung_7TMR
domain (Figure 6; Additional data file 6), which is common to
the mammalian GPR107/108 family. Plant sequences in the
TOM1/3 family have a domain of unknown function,
DUF1084, while Cand9 and Cand10 both have a DUF300
domain. The haemolysin-III domain of the HHP2 family of
Arabidopsis sequences was previously noted [53] and we
show that this domain is conserved across the greater HHP
family in Oryza and Populus (Figure 6; Additional data file
6). Interestingly, several of our candidate GPCRs and candidate GPCR families (Cand1-5 and Cand8) do not have any of
the domains included in the PfamA database. This provides
additional support that these are novel, uncharacterized proteins, but does not provide negative support for their identification as a candidate GPCR: analysis of all of the human
sequences available in the GPCRDB using the Pfam database
shows that 21.4% do not have any associated PfamA domains,
and 6.2% of the sequences have domains that are other than
those annotated as GPCR specific (data not shown). Similar
to the number observed for the human GPCRDB sequences,
20.4% of our Arabidopsis candidate GPCRs did not have
matches in the PfamA database. Although PfamB family
domains are not annotated and are of lower quality, all of our
candidate GPCRs without PfamA domains were assessed for
the possibility of functionally conserved domains in order to
computationally characterize these proteins to the fullest
extent. After PfamB analyses, we find that nearly all of these
candidate GPCRs have some type of uncharacterized domain
(Additional data file 7). Interestingly, in some cases the associated domain is based exclusively on data from members of
the candidate GPCR family or superfamily. For instance,
members of the Cand2/8 family have Pfam-B_26759 and
Pfam-B_14631 domains, but these domains are based on the
ProDom alignment of Cand2/8, a sorghum homologue, and
the human GPR175 sequence (see also Figure 7). This domain
analysis suggests that these two unannotated PfamB domains

Volume 9, Issue 7, Article R120

Gookin et al. R120.16

may be uncharacterized GPCR domains, but this remains to
be proven.
Taken together, our results show that the high ranking Arabidopsis candidate GPCRs that we have empirically shown to
interact with GPA1 are widely conserved in plant species, and
that homologous sequences in other plant proteomes are
indeed independently predicted as high ranking GPCRs by
our approach, further supporting the validity of this method.

Discussion
Bioinformatic identification of Arabidopsis candidate
GPCRs
The experimental elucidation of candidate plant GPCRs has
so far been limited to the discovery of Arabidopsis GCR1 [25]
and its homolog in pea [61], Arabidopsis RGS1 [28], and,
recently, Arabidopsis GCR2 [26]. Within the Arabidopsis
genome no other genes have any appreciable similarity to
GCR1 or RGS1 by BLAST analysis. GCR2 and its two
homologs within the Arabidopsis genome are homologous to
the lanthionine synthetase C family [27], and furthermore, all
of the key LanC-like family GXXG motifs as well as the catalytic residues are conserved between GCR2 (At1g52920.1)
and lantibiotic cyclase, for which a crystal structure is known
[PDB:2g02, PDB:2g0d] [62]. Although GCR2 was reported
by Liu and co-workers [26] as a GPCR, none of the 16 TM prediction programs used to create the ARAMEMNON membrane protein database [63] predict this protein to have seven
TM domains, including DAS and TM-PRED, which were
included in the Liu et al. report [26]. Our whole proteome
analysis using our multiple topology prediction approach did
not predict a single TM domain within this protein. Illingworth et al. [62] mathematically describe how GCR2 can be
misconstrued to have transmembrane domains and show
that GCR2, similar to other lanthionine synthetases, does
have short hydrophobic stretches but these short regions
encompass the conserved GXXG motifs and map to a single
face of the 2g02 crystal structure. Interestingly LANCL1,
another lanthionine synthetase, was initially identified as a
GPCR [64] prior to biochemical experimentation, which confirmed its subcellular localization as a peripheral membrane
protein. Additional discrepancies have also arisen regarding
the description of GCR2 as a GPCR that functions as a receptor for the plant hormone abscisic acid. Gao et al. [27] report
that GCR2 is not genetically or physiologically coupled to
GPA1 and is not required for abscisic acid perception during
seed germination and seedling development
GCR1 has no homologs within the Arabidopsis proteome.
BLAST searches of other plant proteomes, including Oryza
and Populus, do readily identify sequences highly similar to
GCR1, but subsequent BLAST searches using these identified
putative orthologs of GCR1 suggest that these genes also have
no homologs within their respective proteomes. The lack of
obvious homologs of GCR1 in each proteome precludes the

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R120

Genome Biology 2008,

ability to discover new potential GPCRs through the use of
simple homology-based searches. Attempts to identify plant
candidate GPCRs through the use of publicly available GPCR
specific databases were also not productive; the GPCRDB
database [58] and the SEVENS database [65] contain only
GCR1 and sequences from the mildew locus o (MLO) family,
although SEVENS also includes GCR2 and its two homologs.
Searches of the GPCR/G-protein/effector database gpDB
[66] did not identify any plant sequences in the GPCR
category.
To circumvent these problems, we have developed a combinatorial approach to identify novel GPCRs based on the direct
prediction of GPCRs by the QFC algorithm and GPCRHMM;
signal peptide detection by Phobius; TM domain prediction
by TMHMM2, HMMTOP2, and Phobius; and subsequent
GPCR classification by GPCRsIdentifier. Our bioinformatic
analyses of the Arabidopsis proteome identified a primary
tier of 16 high ranking candidate GPCRs using the criteria
that sequences were required to be co-predicted as a GPCR by
the QFC algorithm and GPCRHMM and have a predicted
7TM topology by at least two of the transmembrane prediction programs.
Notably, both GCR1 and RGS1, two proteins experimentally
confirmed to functionally couple to the sole Gα subunit in
Arabidopsis [20,60], are found within our primary tier of
candidate GPCRs (Table 1). RGS1, which has both a 7TM
domain and a long carboxy-terminal RGS domain, was
directly predicted as a GPCR by GPCRHMM only when
analyses were performed using the 7TM domain of the protein. This is because inclusion of the carboxy-terminal RGS
domain introduced sequence bias from the intrinsic amino
acid composition and dipeptide frequency of this domain,
resulting in a lower Global score of -15.27.
Also found in this primary tier of GPCR candidates is HHP2,
one of five members of the Arabidopsis HHP family with
sequence similarities to human adiponectin receptors and
membrane progestin receptors [53], and two members of the
TOM1/3 family implicated in tobamovirus multiplication
[54]. Of the 16 proteins in our primary tier, seven have not
been previously studied and are only annotated as expressed
proteins. The inclusion of these biologically uncharacterized
proteins in our candidate GPCR list provides both a clue as to
their function and a framework to guide the design of future
experimental work.
Since GPCRHMM appears to be highly specific, or at least
highly conservative, in identifying novel plant GPCRs, we reasoned that our strict criteria for identifying the highest ranking sequences most likely excluded the identification of
potentially useful candidates. Removal of the high ranking
candidates identified by GPCRHMM from the intermediate
pool led to the identification of 111 second tier candidate
GPCRs, including HHP1, HHP3, and three members of the

Volume 9, Issue 7, Article R120

Gookin et al. R120.17

MLO family: MLO7, MLO10, and MLO13. The plant-specific
MLO family is named after a barley MLO protein that was
experimentally shown to have a 7TM GPCR-like topology and
play a key role in mediating fungal infection [67]. Aside from
the 7TM topology, there is no evidence to suggest that any
MLO family members couple to Gα. Additional MLO family
members (MLOs 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11 and 14) are identified by our
QFC analysis but are subsequently removed by our ion channel filter step (Additional data file 8).
Attempts to reconstruct an overall evolutionary relationship
using our 16 high ranking candidate GPCRs proved fruitless,
and the inclusion of the remaining set of 111 candidate GPCRs
did not provide any greater resolution beyond the obvious
small gene family clusters identified by BLAST analyses of the
Arabidopsis proteome alone (Figure 6). These phylogenetic
results were expected based on the lack of sequence homology
between our candidate GPCR clusters, which mirrors the
well-established lack of a comprehensive phylogenetic relationship linking all metazoan GPCRs of an organism.

Prediction of candidate GPCR coupling specificity
In the human system, the heterotrimeric G-protein contains
one of 23 different Gα subunits and some GPCRs are
described as promiscuous because they can couple to more
than one type of Gα subunit. Although Arabidopsis contains
only one canonical Gα subunit, GPA1, which is most similar
to a Gz variant of the Gi/o subunit family [3], we used PredCouple 2 to predict the coupling specificity of our candidate
GPCRs. Since GPA1 belongs to the Gi/o subunit family, it follows that Arabidopsis candidate GPCRs associated with
GPA1 should be predicted to couple with members of the Gi/o
family. Our analyses show that 92.2% of our Arabidopsis candidate GPCRs for which Pred-Couple 2 provides a coupling
prediction are indeed predicted to couple to the Gi/o family
(Additional data file 9). Note that the absence of a coupling
prediction does not indicate that a sequence is not a GPCR,
because Pred-Couple 2 initially filters sequences using
parameters based on established GPCRs and is not, therefore,
designed to detect novel or divergent GPCRs [51].

In vivo testing of protein coupling
With the information provided by our bioinformatic analyses,
we turned towards providing empirical evidence that some of
our top candidates truly have the potential to function as a
GPCR. The split-ubiquitin system, a membrane-based variant
of the yeast two-hybrid assay, has been used to demonstrate
coupling of the candidate GPCRs, GCR1 and RGS1, to the sole
Arabidopsis Gα subunit, GPA1 [20,60]. GPA1 has been
shown to act specifically in this binding assay as it does not
bind the inward potassium channel KAT1 or a truncated version of GCR1 [60]. Our in vivo protein-protein binding experiments demonstrated that the great majority (7/8) of the
candidate GPCRs that we tested do interact with GPA1. We
show that candidates Cand1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and HHP2 all couple
to GPA1, provided that the carboxyl terminus of the candidate

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R120

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/7/R120

Genome Biology 2008,

is not blocked by a fused protein tag. This requirement for a
free carboxyl terminus was observed previously for GCR1
[60]. TOM1 did not interact with GPA1 in any of our assays
regardless of protein fusion orientation. Given the apparent
specificity of GPA1 in the split-ubiquitin system, our positive
protein-protein interactions now await confirmation of
interaction in planta. The ability to not only bind Gα but to
stimulate the exchange of guanosine diphosphate for guanosine triphosphate is a key characteristic of classically functioning GPCRs that could also be assessed in future studies.
Within the Arabidopsis proteome, the candidates we tested
for in vivo coupling to GPA1 ranged from a single gene to
members of small families. Cand1 has no homologs within the
proteome, candidates Cand2 and Cand8 comprise a small two
gene family, Cand3 and Cand5 are two splice variant products
of the same locus, and Cand7 is a member of a small four gene
family in Arabidopsis. Interestingly, Cand6 (At5g02630.1),
which is the second closest homolog to Cand7, is also identified in our top tier of candidate GPCRs, suggesting that the
other two members of this family may also couple to GPA1.
HHP2 is part of the five gene HHP family [53], and we predict
all but HHP5 to be GPCRs, suggesting these sequences also
may compose a GPCR family.
Given the positive correlation between our high stringency
computational analysis identifying candidate GPCRs and our
subsequent in vivo assay showing physical interaction with
GPA1 under high stringency (1 mM methionine) conditions
[68], it is likely that these proteins, and their close homologs,
actually function as GPCRs.

Bioinformatic method application to the Oryza and
Populus proteomes
As our method for identifying novel plant candidate GPCRs
successfully identified a set of Arabidopsis high ranking proteins, most of which were demonstrated to physically couple
with GPA1, we next applied our method to the proteomes
deduced from the fully sequenced Oryza and Populus
genomes. Our analyses identified 13 and 20 high ranking candidate GPCRs, and an additional 138 and 182 second tier candidate GPCRs in the Oryza and Populus proteomes,
respectively. Similarly as described for our Arabidopsis candidate GPCRs, those Oryza and Populus candidates for which
coupling predictions were obtained using Pred-Couple 2 were
primarily predicted to couple to the Gi/o type of Gα subunit
(Additional data file 9). And for Oryza, in which the Gα subunit has been characterized, our results are consistent as the
Oryza Gα subunit shows sequence similarities to subunits of
the human Gi family (data not shown).

Evolutionary dynamics of candidate GPCRs in plants
One hallmark of metazoan GPCRs is the conservation of individual GPCRs across divergent organisms. BLAST analyses
using the Arabidopsis candidate GPCRs that we
experimentally demonstrated to couple with GPA1 in the pro-

Volume 9, Issue 7, Article R120

Gookin et al. R120.18

tein binding assays identified a number of homologous
sequences in the Oryza and Populus proteomes, the great
majority of which (47/53) were also independently predicted
as GPCRs by our bioinformatic method (Figure 6). With the
exception of HHP2, all of the Arabidopsis candidate GPCRs
that we demonstrated to couple with GPA1 have homologs
within both the Oryza and Populus top tier candidate lists.
The small Arabidopsis gene family of Cand2 and Cand8,
which shows approximately 22% identity, and approximately
43% similarity to the mammalian GPR175 GPCR family, has
a corresponding two gene family in Populus, but only a single
homolog is identifiable in the Oryza proteome, suggesting a
potential evolutionary loss. Additional homologs can be identified within other plant (grape and sorghum), insect (honeybee), and mammal (human, mouse, rat) predicted proteomes.
Multiple sequence alignments show that the intracellular carboxyl terminus, which has been described as the 'magic tail'
due to its ability to couple with multiple GPCR-interacting
proteins including Gα [57], has near complete identity (Figure 7) within the group of plant sequences. This high
sequence conservation across diverse plant genera points
towards conserved binding partners and potential signaling
mechanisms.
In contrast to the small number of sequences that compose
the other high ranking candidate GPCR families, the Arabidopsis candidate GPCR Cand7 belongs to a small gene family,
which, in turn, belongs to a large 29 member protein 'superfamily' found within the Arabidopsis, Oryza and Populus
proteomes. Phylogenetic analyses show that the Cand6/7
superfamily deeply bifurcates to form two distinct clades. One
clade contains the three closest Arabidopsis homologs of
Cand7 (including Cand6), and the other clade contains three
only distantly related Arabidopsis sequence (Additional data
file 4). The two clades are linked by a single Arabidopsis
sequence found at the midpoint of the reconstructed tree. The
divergence of the Arabidopsis sequences exemplifies the difficulty of finding potential GPCRs by homology alone; without the results from our independent GPCR prediction
pipeline these distant Arabidopsis homologs, which are
phylogenetically surrounded by candidate GPCRs from the
Oryza and Populus proteomes, would not have been discovered as belonging to the Cand6/7 superfamily. All of the proteins within the Cand6/7 superfamily contain a Lung 7TM
receptor domain (Additional data file 6) and are related to the
GPR107/108 orphan GPCR superfamily that contains the
same domain. Interestingly, one residue, Cand7 Trp193,
located near the interior membrane junction of TM1, is invariant in all 29 non-redundant sequences of the 3 plant proteomes, and this conservation extends across kingdoms to
almost all members of the greater GPR107/108 family identified, including insects, fish, and mammals (Additional data
file 5), suggesting its functional importance.

Genome Biology 2008,

Overall, while most of our first tier candidates have homologs
across the three proteomes as well as other taxa, the distribution pattern of putative orthologs and putative paralogs is
heterogenous. As can be seen in Figure 6a-g, the gene trees of
homologs show diverse patterns with none of the seven trees
in Figure 6 showing a consistent set of putative orthologs/
paralogs across the three proteomes. Thus, it seems likely that
while each species retained many of the ancestral GPCRs,
each seems to have specialized through both gene duplications and gene losses.
Although GPCR prediction algorithms all use sequencederived information as a starting point, sequence homology is
not the key component in our method of candidate GPCR
identification. For example, our analysis identifies Cand7 and
its second closest homolog, Cand6, as candidate GPCRs, but
not At3g09570.1 and At5g42090.1, Cand7's first and third
closest homologs. Both of these 'un-chosen' sequences were
excluded from our intermediate pool by the QFC, but they
were directly predicted to be GPCRs by our GPCRHMM analyses and did pass our '2/3' topology prediction requirement.
The four other Arabidopsis sequences identified in the
Cand6/7 superfamily are surrounded in the phylogenetic tree
by candidate GPCRs from both Oryza and Populus and would
have been candidate GPCRs had we not applied the QFC ion
channel filter (Additional data file 4; Table 4). It was deemed
more valuable to include rather than discard the ion channel
filter (see Materials and methods), because this filter removes
a large number (70) of protein sequences annotated as having
channel or transport activity, 43 of which have already been
identified and named, while only excluding 19 potential second tier proteins (Additional data file 8).
Although our bioinformatic approach identified a number of
candidate GPCRs within each of the three proteomes analyzed, the sequences identified do not compose a homogenous group. Using the primary sequence independent fourlevel GPCR classification system in GPCRsIdentifier [50], we
show the majority of our primary tier candidate GPCRs
appear to be most similar to the class A family of GPCRs, the
most abundant type of metazoan GPCRs [16], but belong to a
wide range of subfamilies and subfamily types. Furthermore,
the subfamily classification distribution varied between proteomes. The majority of the Arabidopsis primary tier
sequences were classified into the Olfactory subfamily while
the Oryza and Populus primary tier of candidate GPCRs
showed greater diversity in amino acid composition and
dipeptide frequency.
The direct meaning of these classifications is unclear relative
to their descriptive names since, for example, plants do not
possess an olfactory system. The GPCR classifications provided by GPCRsIdentifier may simply provide a ready-made
system to catalog the breadth and diversity of plant GPCRs,
and eventually, new plant-centric descriptive names should
be devised for these families and subfamilies. Alternatively,

Volume 9, Issue 7, Article R120

Gookin et al. R120.19

these results may suggest an evolutionary relationship and
indicate that mammalian GPCRs and plant GPCRs are
derived from a common class of ancient GPCRs. Along these
lines, it is known that some of the mammalian GPCRs bind
plant secondary metabolites; for example, the ligands of opiate and cannabinoid receptors were first identified as plantderived compounds, and only later it was discovered that
mammals themselves manufacture analogous compounds:
the endorphins [69] and the endocannabinoids [70]. In fact,
the previously thought plant-specific compound morphine is
now know to be biosynthesized de novo by humans [71], and
morphine as well as its biosynthetic precursors have been
shown to activate Gα subunits through GPCR signaling [72].
These data further suggest an evolutionary link between
mammalian GPCRs and plant GPCRs.
Just as relevant evolutionary and physiological links exist
between our candidate plant GPCRs and human GPCR function, plausible links also exist between plant and insect receptors. Herbivory induces plant production of volatile
compounds and one such compound, methyl salicylate
(MeSA), is a mobile signal that induces plant defenses in spatially distant organs of the plant under attack as well as in
neighboring plants [73,74]. MeSA also activates unique neuron specific receptors of the cabbage moth Mamestra brassicae [75] and females of that species avoid ovipositing on
plants and artificial plants equipped with MeSA emitting dispensers [75], apparently in an attempt to avoid plants already
occupied by herbivores. In contrast, volatiles from herbivoredamaged plants attract wasps that parasitize insect herbivores [76], and MeSA has been shown to attract, as well as
elicit electrophysiologically significant responses in, lady beetles [77], which are predators of aphids and plant mites.
Homology modeling and ligand docking simulations [78,79]
using our plant candidate GPCRs, predicted insect receptors,
and tentative ligands such as MeSA may be helpful in identifying prospective receptors that respond to the same ligand,
for example, MeSA, in both plants and insects.

Comparison to previous plant GPCR prediction
attempts
The study of heterotrimeric G-protein signaling in metazoan
systems is mature and, as a result, most of the bioinformatic
analyses of the GPCR family of signaling proteins are based
on metazoan proteins and are designed to predict metazoan
GPCRs. In comparison to both wet-bench and computational
researchers studying mammalian systems, researchers in
plant laboratories have relatively little information with
which to identify novel candidate GPCRs. To our knowledge
there have been only three published attempts at predicting
GPCRs in plants, in papers by Fredriksson and Schioth [16],
Inoue et al. [80], and Moriyama et al. [49].
Fredriksson and Schioth applied a hidden Markov model
(HMM) approach. Although published in the year 2005, the
GPCR prediction attempt by Fredriksson and Schioth [16]

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R120

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/7/R120

Genome Biology 2008,

was performed on a pre-genome sequencing NCBI Genscan
data set containing only 6,600 Arabidopsis predicted proteins [16] compared to the current 29,988. Their analyses
identified only GCR1 and five of the MLO family proteins as
GPCRs in the Arabidopsis data set. The identification of
GCR1 is not surprising as the GCR1 protein sequence was
already shown to have sufficient similarity to sequences from
several classes of GPCRs to be identified as a GPCR by BLAST
and PSI-BLAST analyses [81]. The identification of five Arabidopsis MLO sequences as GPCRs is also not surprising as
Fredriksson and Schioth [16] utilized HMMs trained on the
highly similar MLO family [82]. Fredriksson and Schioth [16]
did extend their prediction attempts to another plant system
consisting of 2,400 predicted proteins from the incomplete
Oryza proteome, and this analysis identified only a single
protein, an MLO, as a GPCR. It should be noted that the
plant-specific MLOs have been described as GPCRs based
solely on their 7TM topology and there are no genetic, physiological, or biochemical experimental data to support their
identification as GPCRs. In fact, the one experimental test of
Gα coupling, with barley MLO1, yielded negative results [67].
During the course of our study, we examined another HMMbased approach, PRED-GPCR [83], but this approach was
ultimately excluded from our final analyses. PRED-GPCR utilizes a homology-oriented probabilistic approach based on
identifying query sequence similarities to descriptive GPCR
family-specific 'signature' motifs. Profile HMM GPCR family
signatures were derived from low entropy regions of multiple
sequence alignments based on GPCRs identified in the SwissProt and TrEMBL databases and sorted into families. Notably, this approach does not explicitly use or assume any topological information.
Our PRED-GPCR analysis of the version 6 Arabidopsis proteome using the default settings identified only seven
sequences (Additional data file 10). Because PRED-GPCR is
based on multiple sequence alignment profile HMMs, relaxing the default settings may allow for identification of candidate GPCRs that are evolutionarily divergent from the
previously identified GPCRs within the PRED-GPCR training
set. Using relaxed user defined settings increased our candidate list to 19 non-redundant sequences (Additional data file
10), and the results for the PRED-GPCR default and user
defined setting analyses have only one sequence in common
(At4g19050.1). None of these PRED-GPCR predicted
sequences were identified by our GPCR prediction pipeline.
This was due to their identification as a non-GPCR by the QFC
algorithm, either with or without the ion channel filter, and
their predicted non-7TM topology, with the exception of
At2g36630.1, which was predicted as a GPCR by the QFC but
has 9 or 11 predicted TM domains, and At1g52780.1, which
was not predicted by the QFC and was predicted only by Phobius to have 7 TM domains. The remainder of the PREDGPCR predicted sequences have 0-3 or 23-24 TM domains.

Volume 9, Issue 7, Article R120

Gookin et al. R120.20

None of the 19 PRED-GPCR predicted sequences were identified as a GPCR by GPCRHMM.
The apparent inability of PRED-GPCR to identify Arabidopsis candidate GPCRs may reflect the fact that PRED-GPCR
was developed and trained using a data set composed of only
class B, C, D, and F GPCR sequences with a high relative proportion of sequences coming from class F, the frizzled/
smoothened group. By contrast, our classification analyses
using GPCRsIdentifier [50] identifies nearly all of our high
ranking candidates in all three plant proteomes as class A
GPCRs (Table 4), and our whole proteome analyses suggests
class A type candidate GPCRs comprise the majority in plants
(data not shown). This comparison provides a rationale for
why these proteins were not identified by the PRED-GPCR
methodology, and indicates that HMM-based approaches will
prove more useful in plants when retrained using plant-specific HMMs derived from candidate plant GPCRs verified to
couple with Gα, such as those identified in the present report.
In 2004, Inoue et al. [80] described the binary topology pattern (BTP) approach and applied it to the analyses of several
proteomes. The BTP method [80] is entirely different from
the QFC and HMM-based approaches in that it does not
directly use any primary sequence information. The BTP
method is based on the observation that although the
sequences of extra-transmembrane regions (the loops and
tails) of GPCRs are highly variable, there is a tendency for the
lengths of these regions to be similar within GPCR families.
By an iterative process, Inoue et al. [80] coded the extratransmembraneous regions of known GPCRs as having a
short (0) or long (1) length and found that a binary code representation of protein topology (for example, 10011001) could
be used for GPCR identification and classification.
The BTP data set published by Inoue et al. [80] was derived
from the August 13, 2001 release of the Arabidopsis proteome
(25,542 sequences) and most predictions are invalidated by
the subsequent high quality refinements of the Arabidopsis
proteome. Examination of the Arabidopsis candidate GPCR
data set predicted by Inoue et al. [80] using the BTP method
showed that only 57 of the 100 predicted candidates had
sequences that remain identical to a protein sequence in the
current version (v7.0) of the Arabidopsis proteome. An additional 8 sequences have 100% identity over the aligned
region, but have protein lengths that differ from the current
sequence. We discount these because the BTP method is
based on coding residue segment lengths. One BTP predicted
GPCR sequence was identified by Inoue et al. as At1g42560,
but actually shows the highest identity (86%) to At2g33670.1.
A comparison of the still-valid 49 BTP-predicted sequences
with our candidate GPCR data set shows that there are 11
sequences in common. Most notably, GCR1 and Cand7, both
found within our high ranking candidate GPCR set, are identified by the BTP method. The BTP identification of GCR1,
which has previously been shown to couple to GPA1 [60], and

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R120

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/7/R120

Genome Biology 2008,

Cand7, which we show in the present study to couple to GPA1,
indicates they have true GPCR topological characteristics
beyond their heptahelical nature and provides further
computational support for their identification as likely
GPCRs. It would be interesting to see how the method of
Inoue et al. [80] would perform on the current proteome;
however, the BTP code was not made available.
The study performed by Moriyama et al. [49] is the most
recent attempt at predicting GPCRs in Arabidopsis. Moriyama et al. [49] utilized multiple alignment free computational methods, along with TM prediction by HMMTOP2, to
identify 394 sequences with predicted 5-10 TM domains.
Although Moriyama et al. [49] further constricted this set to
54 sequences by a 7TM prediction by HMMTOP2, reliance on
a single TM predictor can lead to both false positives and false
negatives. Combinatorial approaches have been shown to
greatly increase discrimination of 7TM sequences [84]
because topology prediction programs' strengths and weaknesses vary, even in the top rated topology prediction programs [39]. Importantly, other GPCR prediction studies,
including the analysis by Moriyama et al. [49], often failed to
utilize signal peptide prediction to account for the confounding effect of signal peptides on TM domain prediction [37].
We found 6,739 non-redundant membrane proteins in the
Arabidopsis proteome using Phobius, of which 1,209 also had
predicted signal peptides. Had we also not accounted for
signal peptide misprediction, we would have mistakenly discarded 2/11 proteins from our upper bin of high ranking
GPCRs, including Cand7, which does physically couple with
GPA1.
Although we report the predicted amino terminus location of
our candidate GPCRs, and nearly all of our high ranking candidate GPCRs do indeed have a predicted extracellular amino
terminus, we differ from Moriyama et al. [49] in that we did
not specifically integrate that information into our GPCR prediction pipeline. However, had we integrated this criterion,
our high ranking candidate lists would not have changed significantly (data not shown).
Our use of the alignment-free HMM GPCRHMM is another
methodological difference from Moriyama et al. [49].
Another machine learning approach, an alignment based
support vector machine method, SAM, was utilized by Moriyama et al. [49], but the results were not used to select their
broad list of candidates as that method was found to have
insufficient predictive power: SAM identified only GCR1 and
14 sequences from the 15 member Arabidopsis MLO family as
candidate GPCRs. In contrast, we utilized the apparent high
specificity of the GPCRHMM software in two serial filtering
steps to identify candidate GPCRs with increasing stringency.
These steps were exceedingly important as our focus went
beyond computational analyses towards selecting candidate
GPCRs for our functional analyses. Our GPCR prediction
pipeline, which ended with our high stringency GPCRHMM

Volume 9, Issue 7, Article R120

Gookin et al. R120.21

filter, enabled the identification of 11 target sequences out of
29,988 non-redundant sequences in the Arabidopsis proteome.
Of the 394 sequences listed in Moriyama et al.'s [49] larger
data set of possible 7TM putative receptors, we found 18
sequences that are actually redundant with other sequences
and four sequences that are no longer found within the current version (v7) of the proteome. Comparing our high ranking candidate data set to Moriyama et al.'s high priority list
shows that we predict only 14.8% (8/54) of their list to be
GPCRs, and their list is missing half of our high ranking candidate GPCRs (Additional data file 11). Comparing our complete set of 127 candidate GPCRs with Moriyama et al.'s
remaining present and non-redundant 372 sequences shows
a similar story as there are only 63 sequences in common; we
predict only 16.9% of Moriyama et al.'s list to actually be
GPCRs (Additional data file 11). Perhaps this is due to a difference in research focus as Moriyama et al. attempt to cast the
broadest net possible while identifying candidate 7TMpRs
while we attempt to find the most highly likely candidate
GPCRs.
Although there is overlap between our high ranking candidate
GPCRs and Moriyama et al.'s high priority list, there are some
interesting differences between the two, especially in light of
our in vivo coupling results. The list of highest priority candidates identified by Moriyama et al. [49] includes Cand8, but
not its closest homolog, Cand2; in fact, Cand2 is not identified
by Moriyama et al. [49] as a candidate GPCR even using their
broadest definition. Likewise, the method of Moriyama et al.
[49] lists Cand3 as a high priority candidate GPCR but fails to
identify the highly similar splice variant Cand5. We have
shown here that all four proteins do in fact physically couple
with GPA1. We also show by direct biological experimentation that Cand7 and HHP2 also interact with GPA1; these proteins are found only in Moriyama et al.'s broader list of nearly
400 candidates. This suggests the power and focus of our high
stringency combinatorial analyses.
Biologically, GPCRs are interesting because of their omnipresence in metazoa and their physiological importance,
while computationally, the GPCR family is interesting due the
extreme range of sequence divergence, which provides an
interesting case for testing the limits of bioinformatic prediction. GPCR signaling via the heterotrimeric G-protein in Arabidopsis is especially interesting because the G-protein
complex contains only single canonical Gα and Gβ subunits,
which leads to the obvious question as to whether the complement of Arabidopsis candidate GPCRs is similarly limited.
Our data now provide an answer to this question as we show,
using the same protein-protein coupling assay used for GCR1
and RGS1, that at least seven additional candidate GPCRs are
present in Arabidopsis. Although we provide evidence showing the physical coupling of these heptahelical proteins to
GPA1, we follow the convention of the GPCR community and

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R120

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/7/R120

Genome Biology 2008,

still call these proteins candidate GPCRs to reflect the fact
that a signaling ligand has not yet been identified and they,
therefore, cannot unequivocally be called GPCRs. To date,
this is also the situation for GCR1, and RGS1, as well as for the
GCR1 homolog in pea [61].
While our study appears highly specific, it is complemented
by the efforts of Moriyama et al. [49] and Inoue et al. [80],
who used different prediction methods. The combinatorial
approach has strength in that it considers diverse information
sources before arriving at a conclusion, and thus further combination of these three independent studies should provide
an even greater level of confidence that the intersecting sets of
predicted GPCRs are truly G-protein coupled receptors.

Conclusion

We have used a combinatorial approach to identify novel
GPCRs based on the direct prediction of GPCRs by the QFC
algorithm and GPCRHMM; signal peptide detection by Phobius; transmembrane domain prediction by TMHMM2,
HMMTOP2, and Phobius; and subsequent GPCR classification by GPCRsIdentifier and coupling specificity prediction
by Pred-Couple 2. After identification of candidate GPCRs,
we bridged the gap between computational biology and wetbench biology by experimental demonstration that the majority of our upper bin high ranking GPCRs, as well as the one
lower bin high ranking GPCR that we tested, can physically
interact with the Gα subunit of the Arabidopsis heterotrimer.
Notably, this extension to wet bench analysis was not performed in the previous plant GPCR prediction attempts, and
is rarely, if at all, performed in bioinformatic studies predicting novel GPCRs in metazoans. With experimental evidence
in hand to validate our method, we classified our high ranking
candidate GPCRs to examine their possible functional diversity using a non-linear sequence dependent method and
examined our candidates for annotated functional protein
domains. Additionally, our within-proteome and cross-proteome molecular evolutionary analyses show that our high
ranking candidate GPCRs are evolutionarily conserved and
that our method can be used not only to identify individual
candidate GPCRs but also to identify evolutionarily conserved candidate GPCR families. Some high ranking candidate GPCRs and GPCR families are uniquely conserved
within plants, while others show evolutionary conservation
that extends to metazoans. These evolutionary relationships
reinforce the probable functional importance of the candidate
GPCRs that we have identified, and the present study is the
first step towards determining their physiological roles in Gprotein signaling.

Materials and methods
Sequence and annotation acquisition
All A. thaliana sequences were obtained from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) ftp Gene download site [85].

Volume 9, Issue 7, Article R120

Gookin et al. R120.22

All our bioinformatic analyses performed on Arabidopsis
sequences were performed using protein sequence from the
updated TAIR ATH1 version 7.0 annotation of the genome,
except for those performed using PRED-GPCR, which was
performed on version 6.0. Although the TAIR ATH1 annotation of the Arabidopsis genome advanced from version 7 to
version 8 during manuscript review, none of the sequences of
our Arabidopsis candidate GPCRs changed and our predictions are still valid. All O. sativa sequences were obtained
from The Institute for Genomic Resource (TIGR) and downloaded from the pseudomolecules ftp site [86]. All Oryza bioinformatic analyses were performed on the TIGR release 5 of
the Osa1 Rice Pseudomolecules and Genome Annotation
database. All P. trichocarpa sequences were obtained from
the DOE Joint Genome Initiative (JGI) and downloaded from
the ftp data download site [87]. All Populus bioinformatic
analyses were performed on the JGI version 1.1 release of the
proteome. All three proteomes were the most currently available versions at the time of analysis.

Locus abbreviations for the Oryza and Populus
proteomes
For brevity, the official locus identifiers used in the Oryza and
Populus proteomes have been abbreviated. For the Oryza
data set, the locus identifier has been shortened by removing
the characters 'LOC_' prior to each loci (for example,
Os01g01010.1 corresponds to LOC_Os01g01010.1). For the
Populus data set, the locus identifier has been shortened to a
three letter abbreviation to indicate the Populus proteome
followed by the unique numerical identifier for each sequence
(for example, Pop171407 corresponds to jgi|Poptr1_1|1
71407).

Computational analyses
To identify candidate GPCRs, bioinformatic analyses were
performed with software designed to directly predict putative
GPCRs, to predict protein topology, to predict the presence of
signal peptides, and to classify putative GPCRs into family,
subfamily, and type.
Computational analyses to directly predict candidate GPCRs
were initiated by analyzing the complete proteome of Arabidopsis with the QFC algorithm [44], GPCRHMM [48], and
PRED-GPCR [83]. The QFC algorithm from Kim et al.
[44,88] was run using the default feature set and discriminant cutoff values; the results were further filtered by a discriminant function for ion channels based on amino acid usage
frequency difference between GPCRs and channel proteins (J
Kim, unpublished data). Analyses using GPCRHMM were
performed with the local scoring option turned on. The Arabidopsis proteome version 6.0 was independently analyzed
twice with PRED-GPCR. The first analysis was performed
with the default parameters and the second analysis was performed with a less stringent user defined filtering option:
combined family motif off, Global E-Value motif cutoff set to
1.1, and CAST low complexity filtering off. The Oryza and

Genome Biology 2008,

Populus proteomes were analyzed by GPCRHMM and QFC
with the same software settings as those used for Arabidopsis.
Topology prediction was performed on the Arabidopsis,
Oryza, and Populus proteomes by analyzing the complete
proteomes with TMHMM version 2.0 [34], HMMTOP version 2.0 [36], and Phobius [37]. TMHMM2 was run using the
'one line per protein' option. HMMTOP2 was run in the
advanced mode with the parameters: FASTA format, Single
Sequence type, Reliable prediction type, text output, and the
results in one line. Phobius was run in the Normal prediction
mode with the short output format mode selected.
Signal peptide predictions were performed on the Arabidopsis, Oryza, and Populus proteomes using Phobius. Only a single run of Phobius is necessary to obtain signal peptide
predictions and TM domain prediction as they are co-predicted. For those protein sequences identified as having a signal peptide by Phobius, the sequences were cleaved 'in silico'
and the predicted mature protein sequences were analyzed
using TMHMM2 and HMMTOP2. Phobius was not utilized
for TM domain prediction of the predicted mature protein
sequences because the co-prediction analytical method of
Phobius could lead to additional in silico cleavage of the
mature proteins and consequent inaccurate TM domain
prediction.
GPCR classification was performed using the GPCRsIdentifier executable program [50] and was applied to analyze the
set of heptahelical proteins identified in our topological analyses of the Arabidopsis, Oryza and Populus proteomes. All of
our candidate GPCRs from all three proteomes were assessed
for coupling specificity using Pred-Couple 2 [51] and examined for the presence of domains catalogued in the Pfam database [52].

It is notable that almost all of our whole proteome analyses
were performed, or could have been performed, using the
publicly available web servers in a reasonable amount of time
with the exception of PRED-GPCR, which appears to time out
while analyzing large batch submissions.
All the raw output files from the computational analyses were
formatted, coded where appropriate, and used to create a
relational database where the single unifying field between all
tables for each respective proteome was the Locus identifier
with splice variant information where available. BLASTClust
(NCBI) was used to create the set of non-redundant proteins
for each proteome with the percent identity and sequence
length options set to 100% and the alignment length threshold enforced for all sequences. Redundant proteins were handled by using the lowest numerical identifier within a
redundant protein set as a representative identifier. The data
sets of corresponding splice variant or other protein redundancies within each proteome are available as Additional data
files 12, 13, and 14.

Identification of candidate GPCR homologs
Arabidopsis, Oryza and Populus protein sequences potentially orthologous to our Arabidopsis high ranking candidate
GPCRs were identified using the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix
and the BLAST algorithm implemented as a module in the
BioEdit software package [89], with a cutoff value of e-20.
Additional analyses performed to identify homologous
sequences were performed using the public BLAST service at
NCBI. Multiple sequence alignments were prepared in
DAMBE [90] using ClustalW and the Blosum series protein
matrix. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed in MEGA4 [91]
using the neighbor joining method with pairwise deletion of
alignment gaps, Poisson correction for amino acid substitutions, and 1,000 bootstrap replicates.

Protein-protein interaction assays
GPCRHMM, HMMTOP2, Phobius, Pred-Couple 2, and the
Pfam queries were run using their respective public web servers, while the QFC algorithm was run locally on a LINUX cluster. The initial whole proteome analyses using TMHMM2
were kindly provided by Dr Jannick Bendtsen while subsequent analyses by TMHMM2 were performed over the internet. PRED-GPCR analyses of the Arabidopsis proteome were
kindly provided by Dr Pantelis Bagos (University of Athens,
Greece). The stand alone executable GPCRsIdentifier program was obtained from the author [50] and run locally.
Results from the BTP method as published by Inoue et al.
[80] were downloaded from the publisher's supplemental
information website. The published BTP analysis was performed on the 2001 version of the Arabidopsis proteome and
only protein sequences from their published results retaining
an exact match to a protein sequence in the TAIR ATH1 version 7.0 were considered further.

Coupling of the Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G-protein α subunit, GPA1, and proteins selected from the highest ranking
pool of candidate GPCRs was experimentally investigated
using the membrane-based split-ubiquitin system assay
[68,82]. Split-ubiquitin system linker adapted gene specific
primer pairs were designed to include a 5' translation initiation codon but not a 3' termination codon and were used to
amplify the full length open reading frame cDNAs of the candidate GPCRs and GPA1. The cDNAs were cloned into the
TOPO-BLUNT II vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California,
U.S.A), sequenced, and the inserts were recovered by restriction digestion and gel purification. The Nubwt, NubG and Cub
fusion constructs were created by homologous recombination
following co-transformation of 50-100 ng of insert and 50100 ng of linearized split-ubiquitin system vector into the
haploid AP5 and AP4 yeast strains. AP4 transformants containing a Cub fusion construct were mated to AP5 transformants having one of the four Nub fusion constructs and then
selected on SD minimal media.

Protein-protein interaction was assayed by patching diploid
cultures to SD minimal media plates lacking His and Ade but
containing either 0 μM, 200 μM, or 1 mM methionine and
scored by visualization of yeast growth after 3-5 days. All
experiments were independently replicated at least twice
starting from the co-transformation stage.
