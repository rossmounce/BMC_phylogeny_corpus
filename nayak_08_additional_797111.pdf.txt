Abstract
Introduction: Lumbrical muscles play a vital role in the precision movements of the hand, along
with the thenar, hypothenar and interossei muscles. The variation in the lumbrical muscle is
clinically significant.
Case presentation: During routine dissection of an adult male cadaver, we observed an
additional muscle belly of the first lumbrical muscle took origin from the tendon of the flexor
digitorum superficialis (FDS) to the index finger, close to the proximal margin of the flexor
retinaculum.
Conclusion: The presence of such an additional muscle in the carpal tunnel should be considered
in the aetiology of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).

Introduction

Case report

The lumbricals are usually four small muscles of the hand.
They are numbered from the lateral to medial side. The
lumbricals take origin in the palm from the four tendons
of flexor digitorum profundus (FDP), pass distally along
the radial side of the corresponding metacarpo-phalangeal joint in front of the deep transverse metacarpal ligament. Each muscle forms a narrow tendon and on
reaching the dorsal surface of the proximal phalanx joins
the margin of the dorsal digital expansion (DDS) [1].
Lumbrical muscle variation has been reported in the literature by various authors [2-6]. Mehta and Gardner
described the anomalous origin of first lumbrical in 2.7%
cases they studied [7]. In the present case we observed an
additional muscle belly of the first lumbrical muscle took
origin from the FDS tendon within the carpal tunnel. The
clinical and the phylogenetical significance of the present
case have been discussed.

During routine dissection of the right upper limb of a 69
year old male cadaver, we observed an accessory muscle
belly took origin from the radial side of the FDS tendon to
the index finger, at the level of the proximal border of the
flexor retinaculum. The accessory muscle belly (71 mm in
length & 6 mm in width) was placed lateral to the first
lumbrical and joined the same before inserting to the
DDS of the index finger. The first lumbrical muscle took
origin from the radial side of the FDP tendon for the index
finger as expected (Fig 1). Both the first lumbrical muscle
and the accessory muscle belly were innervated by a twig
from the median nerve.

Discussion
Lumbricals as a part of the intrinsic musculature is important for its delicate digital movements. Lumbricals are
quite unique as they connect the flexors of the digits to the

muscle belly for the first lumbrical as observed in the
present case has a phylogenetical significance and the
occurrence of such an anomalous muscle belly may compress the median nerve and cause the CTS.

Conclusion
Clinicians and hand surgeons should be aware of such a
variant of first lumbrical while dealing with the hand, during various surgical procedures.

extensors and that both of their attachments are mobile.
The articular system in the digits is connected by mechanical links and lumbrical muscle is one of the links of this
system that produces dynamic controlled extension of
interphalangeal joints [6]. Many cases of the unusual
muscle belly which appears in the carpal tunnel have been
reported clinically as a cause of CTS, a condition which
occurs when the muscle belly compresses the median
nerve. Anomalous and additional lumbrical muscle as a
cause of carpal tunnel syndrome has been reported in literature
[2,8,9].
Haines studied flexor muscles of the forearm and hand in
the mammals and lizards; he suggested that the FDS in
mammals is homologous with the intrinsic muscles of the
palm, and that it shifts its origin proximally in forearm
[10]. Further more Koizumi et al. mentioned that the first
lumbrical muscle and the distal muscle belly for the index
finger of the FDS have an intimate relationship with each
other, and have a common phylogenetic origin [4]. From
the above discussion it is quite clear that the additional
