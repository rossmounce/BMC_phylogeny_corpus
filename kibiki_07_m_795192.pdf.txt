Abstract
Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is a major health problem and HIV is the major cause of the
increase in TB. Sub-Saharan Africa is endemic for both TB and HIV infection. Determination of the
prevalence of M. tuberculosis strains and their drug susceptibility is important for TB control.
TB positive culture, BAL fluid or sputum samples from 130 patients were collected and genotyped.
The spoligotypes were correlated with anti-tuberculous drug susceptibility in HIV-infected and
non-HIV patients from Tanzania.
Results: One-third of patients were TB/HIV co-infected. Forty-seven spoligotypes were identified.
Fourteen isolates (10.8%) had new and unique spoligotypes while 116 isolates (89.2%) belonged to
33 known spoligotypes. The major spoligotypes contained nine clusters: CAS1-Kili 30.0%, LAM11ZWE 14.6%, ND 9.2%, EAI 6.2%, Beijing 5.4%, T-undefined 4.6%, CAS1-Delhi 3.8%, T1 3.8% and
LAM9 3.8%. Twelve (10.8%) of the 111 phenotypically tested strains were resistant to anti-TB
drugs. Eight (7.2%) were monoresistant strains: 7 to isoniazid (INH) and one to streptomycin. Four
strains (3.5%) were resistant to multiple drugs: one (0.9%) was resistant to INH and streptomycin
and the other three (2.7%) were MDR strains: one was resistant to INH, rifampicin and ethambutol
and two were resistant to all four anti-TB drugs. Mutation in the katG gene codon 315 and the rpoB
hotspot region showed a low and high sensitivity, respectively, as predictor of phenotypic drug
resistance.
Conclusion: CAS1-Kili and LAM11-ZWE were the most common families. Strains of the Beijing
family and CAS1-Kili were not or least often associated with resistance, respectively. HIV status
was not associated with spoligotypes, resistance or previous TB treatment.

Background
Tuberculosis (TB) persists as a major cause of morbidity
and mortality, affecting almost a third of the world's population [1]. Inadequate detection and cure rates have been
identified as reasons for a mounting global tuberculosis
burden [2]. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is by
far the major cause of the current increase in tuberculosis
infection. The presence of HIV increases the risk of reactivation of a latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection [3] and rapid thus progression of the infection [4];
HIV also increases MTB transmission rates at the community level, therefore threatening the health and survival of
HIV- seronegative individuals as well [5]. Sub-Saharan
Africa is endemic for both TB and HIV infection [6], and
pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in the HIV-affected countries of eastern and southern Africa, such as Tanzania, has
increased rapidly in the past decades [7].
Molecular genotyping is an important tool for the understanding of TB epidemiology. It can predict transmission
rate and identify dominant strains, strains with an
enhanced capacity to spread, strains associated with outbreak [8], severe disease [9] and drug resistance. Spacer
oligonucleotide typing (spoligotyping) is one of the
molecular genotyping techniques; it is fast, robust, reliable, easy to perform, and cost-effective [10]. On the basis
of the variability of the direct-repeat (DR) locus [10,11],
spoligotyping can detect different M. tuberculosis strains,
such as the Beijing genotype which is associated with
enhanced febrile response in patients during treatment,
and multiple drug resistance (MDR) [9,12,13].
For TB control, monitoring the emergence of drug resistant strains is essential. While detection of drug resistance
by phenotype is hindered by the prolonged time to identify resistant strains, genotypic prediction of drug resistance is faster. Data are accumulating on the correlation
between gene mutations and phenotypic resistance. Such
data however are sparse, particularly from sub-Saharan
Africa where the disease burden is highest. The primary
mechanism for acquiring resistance in M. tuberculosis is
the accumulation of point mutations in gene coding for
drug targets or drug-converting enzymes [14]. Mutations
in the catalase peroxidase gene (katG) [15,16] and in a
gene encoding the enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase
(inhA) [17] have been found to account for 60 to 70% and
10 to 15% of INH-resistant MTB isolates, respectively
[18]. Mutations resulting in an amino acid change within
the 81-bp core region of the RNA polymerase β-subunit
(rpoB) gene are found in 96% of rifampicin-resistant M.
tuberculosis strains [19].
The objectives of this study were to determine the genetic
biodiversity of MTB by spoligotyping and to correlate spoligotypes and anti-tuberculous drug susceptibility in HIV-

infected and non-HIV patients in northern Tanzania, one
of the TB and HIV endemic countries of eastern Africa.

Results
Characteristics of the study population
In total 130 positive-culture samples from 220 patients
were included in the study. The majority of the patients in
this study were from the Chagga and Masai tribes, 41.1%
and 11.6%, respectively. Other tribes were represented by
less than 5% each. Fifty-four (41.9%) were peasants, 28
(21.7%) business people, 18 (14%) miners and 10
(7.8%) herders, the remaining had other occupations. The
mean age (SEM) was 37 years (1). Eighty-three (63.8%)
were male patients. Fourteen patients (10.8%) had a history of previous treatment for tuberculosis. Forty-seven
(36.2%) patients were HIV seropositive. Mean CD4 cell
count (SEM) for the HIV seropositive patients was 200
(35) cells/ml and for the HIV seronegative group the
mean CD4 count (SEM) was 555 (38) cells/ml.
Spoligotypes
A total of 47 spoligotypes was identified among the 130
M. tuberculosis isolates. Fourteen isolates (10.8%) had new
and unique spoligotypes (SIT 0) while 116 isolates
(89.2%) belonged to 33 previously known spoligotypes.
A total of 106 isolates (81.5%) from nine different phylogenetic clusters formed the major isolates (i.e. with five or
more isolates for each spoligotype). These were CAS1-Kili
with 39 (30%) isolates (strains 60–98), LAM11- ZWE 19
(14.6%) (strains 0–19), ND 12 (9.2%)(strains 119–130),
EAI 8 (6.2%)(strains 47–54), Beijing 7 (5.4%)(strains
109–115) and T-undefined 6 (4.6%)(strains 41–46) as
well as CAS1-Delhi (strains 99–103), T1 (strains 31–35)
and LAM9 (strains 20–24) with 5 isolates (3.8%) each
(Figure 1).

Three new shared spoligotypes (a common pattern shared
by two or more isolates) were established from our findings by comparing them with the spoligotypes which were
available in the SpolDB4: one EAI (SIT 2482, strain 49)
with that found in Zambia, one T-undefined (SIT 2482, or
SIT 2484, strain 42) with that found in the USA and one
CAS1 variant – undefined (SIT 2485, strain 107) with that
found in Sweden.
Drug susceptibility testing (DST)
Out of 111 TB isolates which were subjected to DST, 12
(10.8%) were resistant to at least one anti-TB drug. Eight
of the 111 (7.2%) were monoresistant strains: 7 resistant
to INH and one to streptomycin. Four strains (3.5%) were
resistant to multiple drugs: one (0.9%) was resistant to
INH and streptomycin and the other three (2.7%) strains
were MDR strains: two (1.8%) strains were resistant to all
four anti-TB drugs and one (0.9%) strain was resistant to
INH, rifampicin and ethambutol Resistance of the 111

isolates for each drug was as follows: INH 11 strains
(9.9%), streptomycin 4 (3.6%), rifampicin 3 (2.7%), and
ethambutol 3 (2.7%).
Four of the 130 MTB isolates (3.1%) were found to have a
mutation in a katG gene codon 315. Four of the 22 tested
isolates were found to have a mutation in the hotspot
region of the rpoB gene. Of the 11 strains phenotypically
resistant to INH, four strains were also genotypically
resistant to INH. The sensitivity of the mutant katG gene
to predict phenotypical resistance to INH was 30.8% and
the specificity was 100%.
All three strains phenotypically resistant to rifampicin
were also genotypically resistant to rifampicin. Both sensitivity and specificity of a mutation in the rpoB gene to
predict phenotypical resistance to rifampicin was 100%.
As shown in Table 1, two of the 49 isolates (4.1%) belonging to four variants of the CAS1 family (CAS1-Kili, CAS2,
CAS1-undefined, CAS1-Delhi) showed resistance to at
least one drug and four could not be tested. Six of the 30
isolates (20%) of the LAM family (LAM3 or S, LAM9,
LAM11-ZWE) showed resistance to one or more anti-TB
drugs. Three of the 16 isolates (18.8%) of the T family (T3UGA, T1, T-undefined) showed resistance. One of the 13
isolates (7.7%) of the EAI family (EAI, EAI-variant, EAIundefined), one of the 12 isolates (8.3%) of the ND family, and one of the three isolates (33.3%) from the MANU
family (MANU1, MANU2) showed resistance to at least
one anti-TB drug. None of the seven M. tuberculosis Beijing
isolates was resistant to anti-TB drugs.
Out of the 12 resistant isolates two (14.3%) were new and
unique isolates (strain 116 and 126): the three MDR iso-

lates were CAS1- Kili (strain 89), EAI (strain 48) and LAM
11 – ZWE (strain 13) (Figure 1)
Previous TB treatment, HIV status and drug resistance
Out of 14 patients who had a history of previous treatment for PTB, one (7.1%) had a MDR-MTB strain and the
other 13 (92.9%) had strains sensitive to all four first line
anti-TB drugs. Five of the 47 HIV-infected individuals
(10.6%) showed resistance to at least one drug. Three of
the 47 HIV – infected individuals (6.4%) had a history of
previous treatment for TB and none of them had strain
resistant to anti-TB drug.

Discussion
There was a wide diversity of spoligotypes in this study
group; the 130 MTB isolates produced 47 different spoligotypes. The clades observed in this study were more than
three-quarters of the total of 62 clades/lineages currently
documented in the fourth international spoligotyping
database, SpolDB4 [20]. This diversity may be attributed
to increased human movement in this area due tourism,
mining, asylum seeking (refugees) and transborder/international business. Historically, many people from Europe
and Asia also lived here during pre- and post-independence times. The structure of the TB population is determined by geography, demography, and human
migration. Studies have shown that the host's geographical origin is predictive of the clinical M. tuberculosis isolates and there is an apparent stable association of TB
bacilli populations with their human hosts in various
environments [21]. New types (i.e. orphan spoligotypes)
accounted for one-tenth of all spoligotypes in this study.
The low percentage of new types may also be a result of
increased human movements. Countries with a history of
isolation have been shown to have a large number of new
spoligotypes [8]. In this study two of the three new shared

spoligotypes were formed between two geographically
widely separated isolates (strain 42 and 107). This again
is more likely to be due to the increased human movement than homoplasy (i.e. acquisition of two similar
structures without a common ancestor). If it is assumed
that tuberculosis may have affected the early hominids in
East Africa, evolved clonally and then spread to the rest of
the world coincidentally with human migration out of
Africa [13-16], then it is interesting to find that almost all
strains go back to the origin of Homo sapiens sapiens. The
site of this study is within the area of Olduvai Gorge in
northern Tanzania, which is regarded as the "cradle of
mankind". In this context, strains no. 116–118 with
MANU-derived spoligotypes are of particular interest (Figure 1).
Among the different phylogenetic clusters found in this
study, there were only nine major clusters with five or
more isolates, but they comprised 81.5% of all isolates.
This indicates the high transmission rate within the population. This high transmission rate may also be influenced
by the marked prevalence of HIV infection which
increases the risk of tuberculosis for all people in a community, both those with HIV infection and the HIV seronegative community members [5]. Two clusters were by far
the most prevalent: CAS1-Kili and LAM11-ZWE family,
with a prevalence exceeding ten percent. The predominance of these two families by more than ten percent has
been demonstrated by another study based on IS 6110restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The
study showed that the Kilimanjaro and Meru families
were the most prevalent in this area [22], the names of the
families being derived from the two adjacent mountains
found in this area. While the Kilimanjaro family refers to
CAS1-Kili, the Meru family is identical to LAM11-ZWE
[20]. Another recent study, performed in Dar-es-Salaam,
suggested the existence of new CAS1-Kili genotype variants (designated as CAS1-Dar) [23]. However, the absence
of spacer 2 and 15 in the spoligotype-signatures reported
by these authors was not found, even once, in our study.
A single clinical isolate, strain 104 (ST247) looks similar
to the CAS-Dar variants. This may be explained either by
a specific loss of spacers 2 and 15 in the CAS1-Dar variants
or by false negative hybridization spots. Spacer 2 and 15
may indeed sometimes provide barely interpretable
results. If confirmed, the absence of spacers 2 and 15 may
provide interesting clues about the microevolution of
CAS1-Kili in Tanzania.
More than 5% of cases were Beijing isolates which were
the fifth most frequent spoligotype. The presence of seven
Beijing isolates had already been reported in Dar-esSalaam [23]. The mean age of the patients with the Beijing
family was the lowest compared to those with other isolates (Table 1). It has already been reported that Beijing is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/51

associated with young age [24] which implies recent and
ongoing transmission.
A striking finding was that not one single case of M. bovis
or M. africanum was found in this study. This study cohort
consisted mainly of peasants and herders, including the
Masai people who are essentially semi-nomads or herders
and their staple food includes milk and meat. In Uganda
which is a neighbouring country, other genotypes of the
M. tuberculosis complex, previously designated as "M. africanum 2" are the major cause of human tuberculosis [25].
This finding may be a result of improved livestock and
animal husbandry in Tanzania or due to anthropologically rooted differences between Uganda and Tanzania.
All resistant isolates except one were resistant to INH,
either alone or in combination with other drugs. The level
of INH resistance was high; a similar trend has been
observed in many African countries; in some countries up
to one-third of the isolates is resistant to INH [26-29].
This rate is alarming, especially since INH is the first-line
drug which is used throughout the course of TB treatment.
This also means a high probability of the development of
MDR in the future, since it has been observed that MDR
often develops from initial INH-monoresistant strains
[28]. Several reports show a low prevalence of MDR-MTB
in Africa compared to Asia and Eastern Europe [30]. But
the trend seems to be steadily increasing since previous
reports from Tanzania showed that INH monoresistance
was about 5% and MDR was about 1% [31] while our
study reveals a more than two-fold increase in both INH
resistance and MDR. The upward trend in resistance has
also been noted in neighboring countries [30,32].
Despite its high prevalence, the CAS 1 family showed the
least association with anti-TB drug resistance (Table 1);
family LAM and T were more frequently associated with
anti-TB drug resistance.
Another interesting aspect was the fact that all MTB Beijing isolates in this study were susceptible to all anti-TB
drugs unlike reports from other studies [28,33]. A previous study in Indonesia also showed no significant association between Beijing strains and drug resistance [9].
One-third of the study population was infected by both
HIV and TB; this is the common trend in sub Saharan
Africa [34]. The association of HIV infection, however,
with previous treatment for TB was not statistically significant and that with anti-TB drug resistance was absent in
this study. The smaller number of HIV- infected patients
with a history of previous treatment for TB may be attributed to high mortality associated with the first MTB infection in TB/HIV co-infected patients [35,36]. There was no
association between HIV status and spoligopatterns

except for Beijing whereby only one person was HIV seropositive.
The mean CD4 count for patients with Beijing was the
lowest, although all patients except one were HIV seronegative. This low CD4 count despite being HIV seronegative may be due to the pronounced virulence of the
Beijing strain. It has been demonstrated that the Beijing
family is more virulent than other M. tuberculosis strains.
The virulence is attributed to the ability of the strain to
produce phenolic glycolipid which is able to interfere
with host immunity [37].

Conclusion
In this study we found a wide diversity of spoligotypes
with predominance of two genotype families. The Beijing
family was also among the prevalent phylogenetic cluster.
The most prevalent cluster CAS1-Kili and the most virulent Beijing were not or barely associated with anti-TB
drug resistance.
A substantial proportion of resistant isolates was found,
INH monoresistance being the highest and thus signaling
the danger of increasing MDR in the future. MDR was
higher than that described in previous reports from Tanzania.

Methods
In the Kilimanjaro region of northern Tanzania, between
April and September 2005, we collected sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid by direct expectoration or
bronchoscopy, respectively, from 220 patients suspected
of having PTB. The patients presented with coughing,
evening fevers and abnormal chest x-rays. The patients
were seen at Kibong'oto National Tuberculosis Referral
Hospital (KNTH) and Kilimanjaro Christian Medical centre (KCMC), a tertiary care hospital. The specimens were
obtained prior to initiation of TB treatment. For each
patient, any history of TB treatment in the past was noted.
Specimens were digested and decontaminated with NaLC
and 2%NaOH by the standard procedure [38]. Sediments
were used for diagnosis of TB: direct smears for acid-fast
bacilli (AFB) by the Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) method [38] and
cultures in Löwenstein-Jensen (LJ) solid medium in three
slants with or without 0.75% glycerol or with 0.6%
sodium pyruvate. One hundred and thirty TB-positive culture samples (confirmed by smear) were subjected to spoligotyping and genotypic testing for drug resistance to
isoniazid (INH) and 22 for rifampicin; 111 samples
underwent phenotypic DST because the reculture of nineteen strains was not possible. Phenotypic drug resistance
testing was performed for INH, rifampicin, ethambutol,
and streptomycin and genotypic testing was carried out
for a mutation in the katG 315 codon to INH and for a
mutation in the rpoB hotspot region to rifampicin. Geno-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/51

typic resistance to rifampicin was tested with samples
which were INH-resistant, contained phenotypic
rifampicin-resistant strains, or had selected spoligotypes;
phenotypic rifampicin -sensitive strains were used as controls.
DNA extraction
A loopful of Mycobacterial colonies from cultures was suspended in 1 ml of physiological saline solution and
heated at 80°C for 10 minutes to kill the bacilli. The
supernatant obtained was stored at -20°C.
Spoligotyping
Amplification of the spacers was performed using DNA
extract and primers (DRa and DRb) corresponding to the
direct repeat (DR) region of the genome of M. tuberculosis
according to the procedure described by v.d. Zanden et al
[39]. Briefly, 10 μl of the DNA extract were mixed with 40
μl PCR mix containing 5 μl 10× PCR buffer, 3 μl magnesium chloride (25 mM), 4 μl dNTP mix (2.5 mM dNTP
each), 50 pmol DRa primer, 50 pmol DRb primer, 0.2 μl
Taq polymerase and 0.25 μl Tris 1 M (pH 9.0), 0.5 μl UDG
(1 U/μl). Amplification and hybridization were performed according to the manufacturer's manual (Isogen
Bioscience BV, Maarssen, The Netherlands). The hybridized membrane was exposed to X-ray film for detection of
the hybridization signal. The X-ray film (Hyperfilm™ ECL,
Amersham Bioscience UK Ltd.) was read manually to
obtain a complete pattern of the spacers between the DR
regions harbored by a particular strain. Preventive measures were taken against contamination with either previously amplified DNA or amplicons from previous
reactions; the procedure was described by Kwok et al. and
Longo et al; respectively [40,41]. Computer-assisted analysis of spoligotyping patterns was carried out with Bionumerics 4.0 (Applied Maths, St-Martin-Latem, Belgium).

The patterns obtained received a spoligo-international
type (SIT) according to the cluster assignment after the
sequences were processed with the International Spoligotype Database of the Institut Pasteur de Guadeloupe
[20,42]. New spoligotypes identified in the study were
added to the SpolDB4.
Phenotypic drug resistance testing
The proportional method for drug susceptibility testing
(DST) of M. tuberculosis, as described in the manual, was
used [43]; Briefly, for each drug a 1: 10 dilution of standardized inoculum was inoculated onto the control and
drug-containing media. The extent of growth in the
absence or presence of drug was compared and expressed
as a percentage. If growth at the critical concentration of a
drug was >1%, the isolate was considered to be clinically
resistant. 7H10 agar with 0.2 and 1 mg/l isoniazid (INH),
1 en 5 mg/l rifampicin, 5 and 10 mg/l ethambutol and 5

and 10 mg/l streptomycin were used 7H10 agar tubes with
1 ml of culture in 9 ml sterile aquadest served as control.

ten consent was obtained from patients prior to enrolment of the patients in the study.

Genotypic INH and rifampicin resistance testing
Amplification of katG gene containing codon 315 was
performed for detection of INH resistance, using a set of
primers; Foward (GGG CTT GGG CTG GAA GAG) and
Reverse (ACA ACA GTT TCC TCG AGA TCC TGT). This
resulted in a 122 bp long product. Detection of the katG315 wildtype took place by a FAM-labeled probe (5'
CGCGATCACCAGCGGCATCG 3') and detection of the
most common katG-315 mutation from AGC to ACC by a
VIC-labeled probe (5'CGC GAT CAC CAC CGG CAT CG
3'). DNA amplification/detection was performed in 30 μl
reaction volume with the ABI Prism® 7000 Sequence
Detection System (Applied Biosystems): template DNA,
400 nM of each primer and 200 nM of each probe. The
PCR-program consisted of 2 min at 50°C, 10 min at
95°C, 45 cycles of 15 seconds at 95°C, 1 min at 60°C.

Abbreviations

For the detection of rifampicin resistance, sequencing was
carried out with the 3100-Avant sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Amplification of a 437 bp fragment, containing
the rpoB-hotspot region, took place with a PTC 200 thermocycler (Biozym) by forward primer rpoB-F1 and reverse
primer rpoB-R1, as described by v.d. Zanden et al. [19].
The sequence reaction was performed with approximately
50 ng DNA. The results of sequencing were compared to
the rpoB-hotspot wildtype using Bionumerics software
(Applied Maths, St-Martin-Latem, Belgium).

RpoB: RNA polymerase β-subunit

Blood was collected from all patients for detection of antiHIV antibodies using the Capillus™ HIV-1/HIV-2 rapid
test (Trinity Biotech, Bray, Ireland) according to the manufacturers instructions, with positive and negative controls for each test run. Samples positive in the rapid test
were confirmed by ELISA using Vironostika® HIV uniform
II ag/ab microwell enzyme immunoassay (bioMerieux,
Marcy 1'Etoile, France). CD4 counts were determined
using flow-cytometry technique (Becton Dickinson Facs
Count machine with BD Facscount™ reagent).
