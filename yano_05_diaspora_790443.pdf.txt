Abstract
Background: The chromosomes of higher plants are littered with retrotransposons that, in many
cases, constitute as much as 80% of plant genomes. Long terminal repeat retrotransposons have
been especially successful colonizers of the chromosomes of higher plants and examinations of
their function, evolution, and dispersal are essential to understanding the evolution of eukaryotic
genomes. In soybean, several families of retrotransposons have been identified, including at least
two that, by virtue of the presence of an envelope-like gene, may constitute endogenous
retroviruses. However, most elements are highly degenerate and are often sequestered in regions
of the genome that sequencing projects initially shun. In addition, finding potentially functional
copies from genomic DNA is rare. This study provides a mechanism to surmount these issues to
generate a consensus sequence that can then be functionally and phylogenetically evaluated.
Results: Diaspora is a multicopy member of the Ty3-gypsy-like family of LTR retrotransposons and
comprises at least 0.5% of the soybean genome. Although the Diaspora family is highly degenerate,
and with the exception of this report, is not represented in the Genbank nr database, a full-length
consensus sequence was generated from short overlapping sequences using a combination of
experimental and in silico methods. Diaspora is 11,737 bp in length and contains a single 1892-codon
ORF that encodes a gag-pol polyprotein. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that it is closely related to
Athila and Calypso retroelements from Arabidopsis and soybean, respectively. These in turn form the
framework of an endogenous retrovirus lineage whose members possess an envelope-like gene.
Diaspora appears to lack any trace of this coding region.
Conclusion: A combination of empirical sequencing and retrieval of unannotated Genome Survey
Sequence database entries was successfully used to construct a full-length representative of the
Diaspora family in Glycine max. Diaspora is presently the only fully characterized member of a lineage
of putative plant endogenous retroviruses that contains virtually no trace of an extra coding region.
The loss of an envelope-like coding domain suggests that non-infectious retrotransposons could
swiftly evolve from infectious retroviruses, possibly by anomalous splicing of genomic RNA.

Background
Eukaryotic genomes are littered with dozens to tens of
thousands of copies of reverse transcriptase (RT)-based
retroelements [1-3]. Among these are a diverse collection
of elements characterized by long terminal repeats (LTR)
that include the Ty1-copia-like and Ty3-gypsy-like retrotransposon families, endogenous retroviruses, and mammalian lentiviruses [4]. LTR retrotransposons have been
especially successful colonizers of the chromosomes of
higher plants where they constitute as much as 80% of
these genomes [3,5-7]. In soybean, several families of LTR
retrotransposons have been identified [8-10], including at
least two that possess an env-like ORF and resemble mammalian endogenous retroviruses [10,11].
The evolutionary relationship between retrotransposons
and retroviruses has been well established by phylogenetic tree constructions. However, the branches linking
these groups are, not unexpectedly, long ones [4,10,1215]. The major structural difference between retrotransposon and retrovirus genomes is the presence of an envelope
gene (env) in the latter. Retroviral envelope proteins sponsor receptor binding, cell fusion, and particle budding,
and
contain
transmembrane
and
coiled-coil
domains[16]. While the de novo acquisition of an env-like
coding region by transduction could conceivably occur in
a single step, the functional evolution of such a coding
domain might be expected to occur over considerable
stretches of evolutionary time [15,17]. But could the loss
of such a coding domain occur in a single step? This question is far from implausible, considering that all retroelement genomes are RNA transcripts and many are
substrates for splicing reactions. A single event of anomalous packaging of an improperly spliced subgenomic
RNA, followed by reverse transcription could lead to an
env-less element in an evolutionary blink of an eye.
In the present study, the characterization of the soybean
retrotransposon, Diaspora, provides evidence for a relatively rapid transition between enveloped retroelements
and non-enveloped retrotransposons. Our phylogenetic
analysis suggests that the Diaspora retrotransposon
emerged from a lineage of plant endogenous retroviruses
that possesses an env-like gene [10].
Diaspora was initially encountered in a genomic clone as a
5'and 3'-truncated copy nested between copies of another
LTR retroelement (Laten, unpublished). Using both direct
sequencing and in silico analysis, we generated a fulllength consensus copy of Diaspora and confirmed 1) its
membership in the Ty3-gypsy-like family of LTR retrotransposons and 2) its status as the only member of an endogenous retrovirus lineage lacking an env-like gene. The in
silico procedure can be extended to construct consensus
sequences for other repetitive DNA families from degener-

ate elements and from single-pass-read genome survey
sequences, provided the copy numbers are sufficiently
high and constitute a robust collection of overlapping
sequences.

Results
AF095730 is related to gypsy group LTR retrotransposons
Sequencing of subclone pAMH3C [GenBank: U96295]
initially led to the characterization of an env-like gene and
the 3' LTR of the SIRE1 endogenous retrovirus belonging
to the Ty1-copia group of retroelements [11]. The DNA
adjacent to the SIRE1 LTR constituted an initially unidentified 544 bp ORF that gave no hits in BLASTn or BLASTx
searches. However, when the sequence of the adjacent
subclones, pAMH3G and pAMH3D, were addended to
pAMH3C and assembled into a contig [Genbank:
AF095730], a single, 1383-codon ORF with a nonsense
mutation at position 2604, and frameshifts at 2813 and
3139 was generated (Laten and Das, unpublished). The
frameshifts occurred in runs of six thymidines and five
adenosines, respectively. When the frameshifts were
adjusted and the conceptual translation was used to query
the Genbank protein database, numerous high scoring
hits to retrotransposon reverse transcriptases and integrases were obtained (Laten and Das, unpublished).

The large collection of sequences of reverse transcriptases
and integrases that were retrieved, most as contiguous
polyproteins, all belonged to the Ty3-gypsy group of LTR
retrotransposons. While the BLASTp search identified
AF095730 homology to numerous accessions from residue 135 to the carboxyl terminal, no sequences with similarity to the first 134 amino acids were found. The highest
scoring hits were identified as Athila-like, related to the
Ty3-gypsy group element from A. thaliana [18] that has
subsequently been shown to be present in a wide range of
plant genomes, including soybean, other dicots, and
monocots [10]. We have named the new soybean element
family Diaspora.
Diaspora is a multi-copy family
Because the Diaspora DNA in the original genomic clone
was truncated at both ends, we initially probed the λFIXII
genomic library for additional Diaspora copies. Hybridization detected a few thousand positive plaques, confirming
the moderately high copy number of this family. DNAs
from a random sample of twenty positive clones were
amplified using primers derived from the ends of
AF095730 (PDIA01F/PDIA02R and PDIA03F/PDIA04R).
No clone produced amplicons with both primer pairs,
suggesting that all copies of Diaspora in these clones were
either 5'- and/or 3'- truncated, or polymorphic at the
primer sites (data not shown). We inferred that the library
would not readily yield full-length elements. Retrospectively, this finding would have been anticipated had the

unusual length of Diaspora, approaching that of the average insert size in λFIXII, been known (see below). With
the availability of BAC soybean genomic libraries with
inserts in excess of 100 kb [19,20], the possibility of isolating full-length Diaspora copies became a virtual certainty and the λ clones were abandoned in favor of BACs.
Filters containing microarrays of BAC clones derived from
G. max cv. Forest [20] were probed for the presence of
Diaspora. Hundreds of clones hybridized to a prot-rt probe
(pAMH3D) and based on the number of hybridizing
clones in the library, we estimated that Diaspora represents
at least 0.5% of the G. max genome.
Diaspora family members are truncated and
heterogeneous
DNA was recovered from twenty, randomly chosen BAC
clones that hybridized to pAMH3D, and PCR-amplified
using the primer pairs derived from the ends of AF095730
(PDIA01F/PDIA02R and PDIA03F/PDIA04R). Surprisingly, only five clones were amplified by both primer
pairs, suggesting that many copies were either 5' or 3'
truncated or markedly polymorphic. Truncation would be
consistent with the characterization of disrupted and
nested retrotransposons first reported in maize [21]. Of
those containing both termini, none successfully served as
templates for more than two additional PCR-amplifications using the complete set of AF095730-based primer
pairs (PDIA5F through 13R). These findings suggested
that Diaspora is a relatively heterogeneous family. This was
confirmed by limited sequencing of λFIXII [GenBank:
AF095730 and AY656632-AY656653] and BAC [GenBank: AY656654-AY656662] clones using the primers
listed in Table 1. A total of 15,433 nucleotides were
sequenced, of which 7293 were non-overlapping. It
appeared that sequencing individual members of the
Diaspora family directly from genomic clones would not
lead to satisfactory descriptions of functional coding or

regulatory regions, so an in silico strategy for these characteristics was pursued.
Diaspora sequences recovered by BLASTn queries
Prior to the initiation of plant genome sequencing
projects, AF095730 was used to search Genbank for
related sequences. At that time, BLASTp searches returned
a sizeable collection of previously characterized pol polyproteins from Ty3-gypsy-like retrotransposons (Laten,
unpublished). As more and more soybean BAC-end
sequences were deposited in the GSS database [22]; J.
Shultz, K. Meksem, J. Shetty, C. Town, H. Koo, J. Potter, K.
Wakefield, H. Zhang, C. Wu and D. Lightfoot, unpublished] the growing robustness of our BLASTn results
made it clear that Diaspora was a high copy-number retrotransposon and that the database hits derived exclusively
from BAC ends might be assembled into a contiguous,
full-length, consensus Diaspora sequence.

Genbank sequences retrieved using sequentially selected
segments of AF095730 as queries were assembled into an
expanding contig. The BAC-end sequences ranged from
400 to 900 nucleotides in length. Hits with bit scores
≥200 were added to the contig and this cutoff value
generated a manageable collection of sequences.
Sequences anchored to the ends of AF095730 were used
to extend the consensus beyond the 5' and 3' ends of
AF095730 and the assembly of an expanding contig was
launched. Primers generated from these flanking regions
(PDIA15F through 21F) were also used to amplify and
sequence additional regions from two of the full-length
Diaspora candidates in BAC clones.
Two hundred seven Genbank accessions, including thirty
submissions from the present study, totaling 141,423
nucleotides were collected to generate the contig. To avoid
bias, duplicate sequences from different accessions were
purged from the alignment. There were only three posi-

tions for which a strict consensus nucleotide could not be
assigned.
Fig. 1 is a histogram of the density distribution of
sequences used to generate the contig. The average coverage across the length of the contig was 14.8 accessions,
although inclusion of many additional sequences that
met the scoring criterion in regions of high sequence conservation was not pursued. Because the initial soybean
BAC libraries were created by EcoRI, HindIII, or BamHI
digestion, the local robustness of the assembly was
dependent on the density of these sites in Diaspora. Subfamilies that lacked a particular cleavage site would be
under-represented. In contrast, the assembly of regions far
from these sites was made possible by sub-families with
additional recognition sites for one of these enzymes.
Structure of Diaspora
The length of the Diaspora consensus is 11,737 bp (Fig. 2),
far longer than all but a handful of retrotransposons. The
exceptional length of Diaspora is due primarily to the unusual length of its LTRs and the long gap between the
upstream LTR and the gag start codon (Fig. 2). Like nearly
all other retroelements, the LTRs terminate in TG...CA.
The element is characterized by a contiguous 1892-codon
ORF whose conceptual translation yields a single gag-pol
polyprotein (Fig. 3) characteristic of Ty3-gypsy-like retrotransposons [23]. Not surprisingly, the consensus contains neither nonsense codons nor frameshifts. This
translated ORF possesses core domains for gag
(CDD17379), reverse transcriptase (CDD16610) and
integrase (CDD25582). There is also a CX2CX4HX4C zinc
finger motif in gag and a conserved protease catalytic
domain motif, AMLDLGAS (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the first
thirty amino acids of the translated ORF are not similar to
the amino termini of any gag proteins in Genbank. Similarities to several gag proteins begin at position 31. Translation of the other five reading frames yielded no lengthy
ORFs nor any similarities to any sequences in BLASTP
searches.

As in the Calypso group [10], the tRNA primer binding site
(PBS) begins 5 bp beyond the 3' end of the LTR and is perfectly complementary to the 3' terminal 18 bases of
tRNAAsp from Glycine max [24] (Fig. 4). At 873 bp, the distance between the LTR and the putative gag start codon is
unusually long and not shared by related elements. This
region contains no extended ORFs and neither BLASTn
nor tBLASTn searches of the nr database retrieved significant hits.
Five potential splice donor sites, all in the LTR between
1400 and 2200 bp upstream of the gag-pol ORF, were predicted with medium confidence and two potential acceptor sites flanked the start codon. Although without

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/30

splicing, the 5'UTR of any Diaspora transcript would be
exceptionally long, the biological relevance of these sites
is not known, and there are no reported examples of
introns upstream of gag for any retrovirus or LTR
retrotransposon.
The pol stop codon is 128 bp upstream of the polypurine
tract (PPT) that abuts the 3' LTR. Thus Diaspora contains
no envelope-like coding sequence beyond pol unlike those
reported for its closest relatives, including members of the
Athila and Calypso families (Wright and Voytas, 2002),
BAGY-2 (Vicient et al., 2001), and Cyclops-1 [8,10,13].
When this short region was used in BLASTn and tBLASTx
searches, no additional sequences with significant probabilities were recovered. Interestingly, translation of this
short region yields a strongly predicted transmembrane
domain, although it is interrupted by two stop codons
(data not shown).
The Diaspora LTR is 2524 bp in length (Fig. 2), making it
one of the longest among retrotransposons and contributing to its unusual length. By comparison, the RIRE3 LTR is
2316 [25], BARE-1 is 1829 [26], Athila1-1 is 1539, and
Cyclops-1 is 1504 [8]. Only the LTRs from Ogre and BAGY1, at over 5,000 and 4200 bp, respectively [27,28], are
longer.
The length of the Diaspora LTR made it impossible to construct unique 5' or 3' LTRs by the in silico method
employed. In addition, the absence of a contiguous element prohibited characterization of target site duplications. However, we identified eight accessions from the
database that contained the tRNA PBS and part of the
adjacent upstream LTR. The longest of these extended 491
bp upstream of the PBS. Twenty-two sequences contained
the PPT and part of the adjacent downstream LTR. The
longest of these extended 596 bp into the LTR. Thus, the
central 1437 bp could not be uniquely assigned to either
LTR. As a consequence, the available LTR sequences were
merged to generate a single, consensus LTR that was
affixed to both Diaspora ends.
Thirteen LTR sequences were 5' junctions and sixteen were
3', based on the complete absence of sequence similarity
beyond the 5' or 3' ends, respectively, of the aligned LTR
sequences. When the flanking DNAs of these 29
sequences, were used in BLASTn searches to query the GSS
database, all but three generated dozens of hits (data not
shown), and thus constituted repetitive elements themselves. Of the repetitive flanking DNAs, 75% represented
Diaspora insertions into the coding regions of other retrotransposons. In addition, insertions into the coding
regions of transposons related to En/Spm and Tam3 were
also found. The identity of the three low- or single-copy
sequences could not be ascertained. The Diaspora family

therefore appears to be embedded in retrotransposon and
transposon-rich regions. We have made similar observations for the SIRE1 retroelement (unpublished). Searches
focused on the region upstream of the PPT failed to
uncover any Diaspora copies with additional DNA
between pol and the PPT.

Among the sequences used to assemble the contig, noncoding regions contained a variety of short indels,
especially in homonucleotide runs and dinucleotide
repeats, presumably from replication slippage. The
sequences in the GSS collection from which the consensus
was built represented unedited submissions, and excluding single base indels that might have been the result of
unedited miscalls, most of the indels in the ORF retained

CG821179,
CG822466,
AY656639, AY656648, and AY656656, were chimeric and
probably represented truncated copies. All but two of
these sequences were within gag or the putative 5'UTR.
Since chimeric sequences in GSS would invariably produce lower bit scores, they were generally excluded form
the contig. Consequently, many of the slightly lower scoring sequences initially retrieved in our BLASTn search
were also chimeric, but were not retained for the assembly
and were not further characterized.
Diaspora is phylogenetically related to plant endogenous
retroviruses
The conserved region of RT was translated and the region
representing peptide domains 2 though 7 [29] was used in
a BLASTp search to retrieve closely related accessions from
Genbank. All of the sequences retrieved were from higher
plants and their distribution among species reflected, to a
large extent, the current progress of genome sequencing
projects. The sequences were aligned (see Additional file
1) and a neighbor joining tree was generated (Fig. 5) and
was rooted to the RT from gypsy.

The tree resolves two major clades, designated A and B
(Fig. 5). With respect to coding potential beyond pol, clade
B members have none, and in all cases, the pol stop codon
is closely followed by a PPT and the LTR. In contrast, with
the exception of Diaspora, all members of clade A for
which sequences downstream of pol are available contain
a putative env-like pseudogene. The major structural difference between Diaspora and other members of this
group is illustrated in Fig. 6. Clade A is further partitioned
into sister clades AI and AII with 94% bootstrap support.
Clade AI is further divided, with 100% bootstrap support,
into AIa/b and AIc. The bifurcation of AIa and AIb in Fig.
5 is only weakly supported (40%) and may not be significant. Clades AIa and AIb are populated exclusively with

env-containing members, including the Athila and Calypso
families. The only full length members of AIc are Diaspora,
DiasporaLc, and Tpb1-1. The other members of the AIc lineage are sequences from PCR-amplified rt fragments from
sycamore and cotton [10], and three representative rt-containing genomic clones from Fritillaria. DNA downstream
of the Fritillaria rt has not been characterized (C. Baysdorfer, personal communication). In contrast to Diaspora in
G. max and its close relative in L. corniculatus, 1479 bp separate the pol stop codon from the LTR in Tpb1-1. While
this region contains no identifiable or extended ORFs,
there is a proximal 19-codon ORF whose conceptual
translation is predicted with very high confidence to be a
transmembrane domain (data not shown). There is also a
47-base polyA segment in the middle of this region, suggesting the interval contains an integrated cDNA. Thus,
the AIIc lineage is not monophyletic for the absence of a
long pol-LTR interval, but whether this region in Tpb1-1
represents a degenerate env cannot be determined.
In conclusion, the nesting of clade AIc within a much
larger group of elements with an env-like gene suggests
that at least Diaspora suffered a complete and nearly precise loss of a coding region, rather than failed to acquire
one. To more exhaustively search for other members of
this group, the RT from members of lineage AIc were used
in tBLASTn searches. All hits, however, were already in the
tree.

Discussion
The DNA sequence of the previously unreported Diaspora
retrotransposon was created by a combination of experimental and in silico methods utilizing Glycine max
sequences currently available as single-pass-read accessions in public databases. To date, the publicly available
G. max sequence collections, including the NR and HTGS
databases, contain no full-length copies of this element.

Figure 6 organization of Athila, Calypso, and Diaspora consensus elements
Structural
Structural organization of Athila, Calypso, and Diaspora consensus elements.

have frequently been generated from alignments of multiple family members [30-35], but the construction of a
full-length consensus sequence of a new element from
large numbers of short overlapping fragments has not.
While appropriate for early stage genome projects like that
of soybean, resorting to such a strategy is neither required
nor efficacious in genomes that have been extensively
sequenced, like those of Arabidopsis, rice, Drosophila and
humans.
Diaspora has a single uninterrupted ORF encoding gag,
protease, RT, and integrase as a single polyprotein. Consensus assemblies for Athila and Calypso elements also
contain a single ORF for these proteins [10]. While we
cannot infer that functional copies of Diaspora still exist in
the G. max genome, the density of the contig assembly
and the presence of a strongly conserved consensus nucleotide at virtually every position of the assembly supports
the argument that a reasonable facsimile of a past functional element is depicted.

The Diaspora family is also present in the Lotus corniculatus
genome, where we discovered an apparently 5'truncated
copy on a Phase I HTGS clone, AP007806. Excluding
indels, the lotus sequence shares approximately 80%
nucleotide identity with the Diaspora consensus sequence
over a length of 7 kb. Most of the indels in the coding
region are in-frame. Like Diaspora, the lotus element lacks
an env-like region. With the exception of two 7-bp and
one 15-bp indels, the short intervals between the pol termination codon and the LTR are 88% identical between
the two. Additional truncated copies of Diaspora family
members are present on ten other Phase I HTGS clones
from L. corniculatus.
Diaspora is unusual in several respects. 1) It has unusually
long LTRs. 2) At 873 bp, the distance between the LTR,
which should contain the promoter and transcriptional
start sites, and the gag start codon is far longer than every
other characterized retroelement except one. And 3)
Diaspora is the only characterized envelope-less member
of a lineage of plant gypsy-like endogenous retroviruses.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:30

The significance of the extended length of the LTRs found
in BAGY-1 [28], Ogre [27], RIRE3 [25], and Diaspora are
difficult to ascertain since virtually nothing is known
about the biology of these elements. The same is true for
the unusually long regions between the LTR and the gag
start codon in Diaspora and Ogre, although in the case of
Ogre, this region contains a 550-codon ORF whose conceptual translation yields a polypeptide of unknown function. Since transcriptional start sites are always found at
the U3-R junction of the LTR, an exceptionally long 5'UTR
would result unless splicing occurred. However, there
have been no introns reported upstream of gag in any LTR
retroelement, including Ogre [27], for which transcripts
have been characterized,.
Unlike all other characterized members of an apparent
plant endogenous retrovirus lineage [10], Diaspora lacks
an envelope-like coding domain downstream of pol. Few
members of this lineage contain functional gag-pol genes,
based on the presence of nonsense and frameshift mutations, and none contain a functional env-like gene based
on these same criteria. The only other fully sequenced
member of clade AIIc, Tpb1-1, contains a strongly predicted TM just downstream of the pol stop codon, but is
contaminated by an apparent retrogene, and the region
could not be characterized as env-like based on amino
acid similarity.
The hypothetical env-like proteins exhibit little primary
sequence similarity, and only those found in Calypso and
Cyclops-2, which share 29% amino acid identity, appear
to be homologous [10,12]. Without significant sequence
similarity, we are reluctant to speculate whether the predicted transmembrane domain for the translated 128 bp
fragment between pol and the PPT in Diaspora reflects a
vestige of an env-like gene.
The tree in Fig. 5 is similar to that generated by Wright and
Voytas [10]. In their study, many members of the endogenous retrovirus lineage were derived from rt-delimited
PCR amplicons, few of which are included in on our tree
because the presence of an env-like region was not empirically determined. Our analysis, however, includes several
additional full-length elements whose env-like status has
been determined. We infer from this analysis that an
ancestral Diaspora element suffered a deletion of this
region. Whether Tpb1-1 suffered a similar fate but subsequently acquired a retrogene is open to speculation. Using
this region to query Genbank in BLASTn and tBLASTx
searches yielded no hits. While envelope capture by LTR
retrotransposons has been credited with the creation of
infectious retroviruses [15,17], only the env genes of invertebrate elements have been phylogenetically linked to
unrelated viruses [14]. The failure to uncover an analogous linkage in retroviruses has been attributed, in part, to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/30

accelerated divergence promoted by host-induced
immune responses that fuel positive selection for envelope variants [14].
Studies focused on envelope loss have not been reported,
although phylogenetic relatedness between mammalian
retroviruses and endogenous retroviruses with env pseudogenes is recognized [36]. Although the env genes of
most human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) families are
marked by frameshifts, nonsense mutations, and deletions [37], in only one family, HERV-L, are all vestiges of
the env gene lost [37]. In the case of HERV-L, the region
between pol and the LTR is occupied by a dUTPase coding
domain [37]. Other members of the class III HERV clade
that contains HERV-L, including HERV-S, contain env
pseudogenes [36]. Interestingly, with a copy number of
575, the HERV-L family is second only to the HERV-H
family in abundance [36].
Diaspora and DiasporaLc possess no trace of the env-like
genes that are present in all members of clades AIa, AIb,
and AII (Fig. 5). Whether other members of clade AIc,
from cotton (Gossypium), sycamore (Platanus) and lily
(Fritillaria), also lack an env region is not known, and the
precise node within this clade that represents envelope
loss cannot be assessed.
One explanation for an abrupt and complete loss of env is
anomalous splicing of a genomic transcript containing
gag-pol-env. Retroelement genomes are packaged as
genomic RNA transcripts and retroviral transcripts destined for translation are often substrates for a complex
pattern of splicing [38]. Alternatively, illegitimate recombination could lead to DNA loss and has been proposed
as a major component of element elimination from plant
genomes [39-41]. Many of the individual sequences that
made up the contig contained short deletions not shared
by others. This was especially true in non-coding regions
(data not shown). Whatever the explanation, Diaspora
appears to be an example of a retrotransposon that
evolved from an endogenous retrovirus.
The nature of selective forces, if any, that might drive the
loss of an env gene is open to speculation. Env genes,
required for retroviral infectivity, are not thought to be
required for retrotransposition, and it is possible that for
some retroelements the gene or its protein product might
attenuate the process, promoting selection for their inactivation, but with concomitant loss of infectivity. As noted
above, in one of the largest families of HERV, the env gene
has been replaced with a dUTPase. In plant genomes,
however, the copy numbers of both putative endogenous
retroviruses like SIRE1 [11], Calypso[10], and BAGY-2 [13]
and retrotransposons like BARE-1 [42], Opie-2 [21], and
Diaspora reach into the thousands. On the other hand, env

genes in both mammalian and plant endogenous retroviruses are far more degenerate than those in pol, suggesting
they are far less sensitive to purifying selection. The proliferation of one retroelement form or the other may be the
result of random mutation and genetic drift. Nonetheless,
retrotransposition, with or without an env gene, has been
a far more successful long term reproductive strategy than
retroviral infection.

Methods
DNA isolation, amplification, and sequencing
DNA containing the SIRE1 endogenous retrovirus was
recovered from a λFIXII soybean genomic library (Stratagene) by standard plaque hybridization [43], and HindIIIdigested fragments were sub-cloned into pSPORT1 (Life
Technologies) as described [11]. DNA from three contiguous subclones, pAMH3C, pAMH3G, and pAMH3D were
isolated and sequenced as described [11]. The junctions
and contiguity of these subclones were confirmed by
direct sequencing of the intact λFIXII genomic clone
across the HindIII junctions. These sequences were previously deposited [Genbank: U96295 and AF095730]. A
BLASTp search with the conceptual translation of
AF095730 (see below) indicated that this accession contained the pol region of an uncharacterized retrotransposon. Several additional positive clones from this library
were recovered and segments of the isolated DNAs were
sequenced directly or amplified using Taq DNA Polymerase (Promega). For amplifications, reactions were preheated for 3 min. at 94°C, then 30 cycles were run at 94°C
for 30 sec., 54°C for 30 sec., and 72°C for 1 to 2 min.
Amplicons were spin column-purified (Qiagen) and
sequenced as described [11]. Sequences were deposited
[GenBank: AY656632-AY656653].

pAMH3D, compromising the protease and RT coding
domains, was used to probe a soybean BAC library [20]
(generously provided by K. Meksem) under moderate
stringency [43] for the presence of sequences related to
AF095730. Ten clones were chosen arbitrarily for amplification and sequencing. DNAs from BAC clones were
recovered using Procipitate (Ligochem) and selected
regions were amplified using Taq DNA Polymerase
(Promega). After preheating reactions for 3 min. at 94°C,
30 cycles were run at 94°C for 30 sec., 54°C for 30 sec.,
and 72°C for 1 min. Regions within pAMH3D were first
PCR-amplified using primer pairs PDIA01F-02R,
PDIA03F-04R, PDIA05F-06R, PDIA07F-08R, PDIA09F10R, PDIA11F-12R, and PDIA13F-14R (see Table 1). The
amplicons were purified on Qiagen spin columns and
sequenced directly without cloning as described [11].
Sequences for regions beyond the ends of AF095730 were
generated directly from BAC DNA using outward facing
primers (PDIA02R and 03F) derived from the termini of
AF095730, followed by additional outward extensions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/30

with primers PDIA16F, 17R, 18R, 19R, 20R, 21F (Table 1).
BAC clone sequences have been deposited [GenBank:
AY656654-AY656662].
In silico methods
Selected regions of AF095730 and their conceptual translations were used to query all relevant Genbank databases,
including nr, Genome Sequence Survey (GSS) and
Expressed Sequence Tag (EST), with BLASTn and BLASTp
searches [44,45]. Conserved protein domains were identified with CDD [46].

For assembly of the consensus nucleotide sequence, Glycine max accessions from the GSS and EST databases with
bit scores greater than 200 (E values < 10-52) were added
to the consensus construct. These criteria generally reflect
>90% DNA sequence identity over at least 200 bp of overlap. The nr nucleotide database contained no significant
hits. New additions to the ends of the expanding consensus were used to re-query the databases until the LTR
redundancy was recognized and the contig formed a
circle. Contigs were assembled using the Seqman program
from Lasergene 5 (DNAStar). To locate the LTR, direct
repeats greater than 25 bp were first identified using Lasergene GeneQuest (DNAStar) and the termini of the LTRs
were confirmed by manual inspection, as were other noncoding features of the sequence. Because LTR junction
sequences at both termini contained either internal element DNA or external flanking DNAs, these were carefully
examined for consensus DNA (internal) or unique DNAs
(external). External DNAs were trimmed from the contig.
Potential splice junctions were evaluated using GeneSplicer [47] and NetGene2 [48]. Transmembrane
domains were predicted using TMPred [49]
The pol region of the conceptually translated consensus
sequence was used to query the Genbank protein database
for related sequences. A ClustalW alignment (see Additional file 1) was generated from a contiguous region of
RT representing conserved domains two through seven
[29] using Lasergene 5 (DNAStar), and a neighbor joining
tree using p distances with 1000 bootstrap pseudo-replicates was constructed using MEGA2 [50].
