Abstract
Background: Orthologous genes with deep phylogenetic histories are likely to retain similar
regulatory features. In this report we utilize orthology assignments for pairs of genes co-regulated
by bidirectional promoters to map the ancestral history of the promoter regions.
Results: Our mapping of bidirectional promoters from humans to fish shows that many such
promoters emerged after the divergence of chickens and fish. Furthermore, annotations of
promoters in deep phylogenies enable detection of missing data or assembly problems present in
higher vertebrates. The functional importance of bidirectional promoters is indicated by selective
pressure to maintain the arrangement of genes regulated by the promoter over long evolutionary
time spans. Characteristics unique to bidirectional promoters are further elucidated using a
technique for unsupervised classification, known as ESPERR.
Conclusion: Results of these analyses will aid in our understanding of the evolution of
bidirectional promoters, including whether the regulation of two genes evolved as a consequence
of their proximity or if function dictated their co-regulation.

Background
Bidirectional promoters are defined as the regulatory
regions that are shared between two genes, when those
two genes are transcribed away from one another [1]. The
genes are said to be in a head-to-head arrangement, with
their Transcription Start Sites (TSSs) positioned nearby
one another. By definition, the intergenic distance
between these genes (i.e. the promoter length) can be no
greater than 1000 bp [1]. This distance is measured from
the TSS of the gene on the left of the promoter to the TSS
of the gene on the right of the promoter. Head-to-head
genes are spaced at this distance more frequently than

expected in the human genome [2], suggesting a regulatory theme in gene expression. We recently showed that
the human genome contains more bidirectional promoters than previously recognized [3,4]. Here we map the
orthologous regions of bidirectional promoters in seven
additional species.
Using the "chains and nets" data from the UCSC Human
Genome Browser and the Liftover tool [5], we are able to
use the identity of genes on each side of a bidirectional
promoter to find the corresponding functional location in
other species. The use of these orthologous genes, which

were present in the last common ancestor to the species
being compared, is important because bidirectional promoters themselves often do not show a strong signal for
conserved sequences. This fact makes the assignment of
ancestral relationships difficult in these regulatory
regions. Because genes flank both sides of bidirectional
promoters, they provide markers of the ancestral history.
The presence of the same head-to-head genes over long
evolutionary time spans facilitates the assignment of
orthology at their intervening promoter regions. Our
approach complements and extends the work of Li et al.
2006 [6] who examined bidirectional promoters in multiple species, because we are able to explore the ancestral
history of bidirectional promoters in eight species simultaneously using whole genome orthology information.
Our method uses orthologous genes as anchors that can
be traced across vertebrate genomes. We use this information to track the appearance of bidirectional promoters in
vertebrate evolution, predict when gene annotations are
missing in higher vertebrates and determine which gene
functions regulated by these promoters are the oldest.

Results and discussion
Orthologous gene pairs identify ancestral patterns of gene
regulation
Human protein-coding genes regulated by bidirectional
promoters were placed into 821 pairs and mapped to
other species using conserved synteny information
applied through the approach outlined in Figure 1. Three
types of outcomes were detected in the species being compared to human, including (I) the orthologous bidirectional gene pair was present in the second species (II) only
one member of the gene pair was present in the second
species and (III) no evidence existed for a bidirectional
promoter in the second species. Comparisons were
between human, chimp, rhesus, dog, mouse, chicken,
Fugu, and zebrafish.

Figure 2 illustrates the evolutionary history of bidirectional promoters in vertebrates. For instance, 60 pairs of
human genes showed orthologs in all seven species.
Another set of genes had orthologs in mammals and fish,
but not birds, suggesting evidence for lineage specific loss.
Other examples had gene pairs lost only in Fugu or
zebrafish, suggesting missing annotations in one fish or
another. One other set of genes was absent from dog
annotations, but present in primates and mouse, suggesting that these genes were missing from the dog genome
annotations.
Other sets of bidirectional promoters showed a lineagespecific history. For instance, a large group of mammalspecific genes was not present in chickens or fish. A
smaller group was only present in primates. In contrast,
genes that were present in all species except chimp were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S6/S9

likely to be missing from chimp due to assembly problems. Nearly twenty pairs of genes were found only in the
human genome.
Intergenic distance at bidirectional promoters
The distance between TSSs at bidirectional promoters was
mapped for human and other vertebrate species. Each species is shown in two graphs. One graph depicts the raw
distance measurements between the TSS in human and
the second species (Figure 3). The distance measurements
are graphed with human on the x-axis and the second species on the y-axis. The scatter plots indicate the size of the
datasets and the correlation of the bidirectional promoter
lengths at orthologous gene pairs of eight species. The red
line shows the position of a linear relationship (x = y),
where the distances between the TSSs are the same for the
two species.

The second graph shows the cumulative percentage of
bidirectional promoters mapped in human and a second
species, where the human dataset is limited to a 1000 bp
distance. The most complete annotations were found in
the human-mouse comparison. This result is illustrated
by the similar curves for the cumulative percentage of
orthologous bidirectional promoters in mouse that fall
within 1000 bp. Up to 80% of all human bidirectional
promoters were identified in mouse at this similar distance. In comparison, 75% of the human promoters were
present in chimp within 1000 bp. The high levels of
orthology found in mouse and chimp suggest that the
1000 bp distance will capture similar gene sets in other
species. Thus we predict that the gene annotations of
chimp, rhesus and dog will improve to represent a minimum of 80% of the bidirectional promoters the human
genome.
Evolutionary comparison of head-to-head and tail-to-tail
gene pairs
The percentage of human bidirectional promoters
detected at distances up to 1000 bp was compared to the
cumulative percentage detected in other species (Figure
4). Evidence of selective pressure was determined from
the retention of human tail-to-tail genes, spaced within
the 1000 bp limit, in other species. Pairs of genes representing bidirectional promoters are shown in green and
tail-to-tail genes in purple. The same color scheme was
used for the second species, except that different symbols
were used. Although the total percentage of genes mapped
in the second species was less than 100% for chimp, rhesus, and dog, the head-to-head and tail-to-tail gene sets
had equivalent amounts at the 1000 bp distance. In these
datasets the tail-to-tail genes plateau at a longer intergenic
distance than the head-to-head genes. Thus a larger distance between the orthologous genes has been tolerated
without deleterious effects.

of important regulatory or functional roles that cannot be
disturbed.
Gene ontology associated with bidirectional promoter
regulation
Functions associated with orthologous genes regulated by
bidirectional promoters were examined for those conserved in all seven species, or in the four mammals. Sixty
pairs of genes were conserved across all seven species.
These genes were examined for functional classifications.
Four groups emerged: intracellular membrane bound
organelle, macromolecule metabolism, chaperone, and
mitochondrion. The p-values on these groups ranged
from 10E-3 to 10E-1, and remained statistically significant
following Benjamini correction for false discovery rate
(i.e. ~2.7E-1).

ers
Flow diagram for mapping orthologous bidirectional promotFlow diagram for mapping orthologous bidirectional
promoters. The initial stage identifies orthologous regions
between humans and other species. This stage is further
refined by defining whether these regions align to nongapped regions (as nearly perfect matches) or as chained
alignments with gaps. After narrowing the region of orthology, genes with orthology can be identified and bidirectional
promoters examined. Genes are placed into three categories: Type I genes have orthologous bidirectional promoters
surrounded by orthologous pairs of genes. Type II genes have
one of two of the orthologous genes in the gene pair and
therefore no bidirectional promoter based on the ENSEMBL
gene annotations. Type III genes have no orthologs in the
ENSEMBL annotations.

For chicken datasets the head-to-head gene sets were
found more frequently than the tail-to-tail sets at 1000 bp,
indicating that tail-to-tail arrangements of genes had been
allowed to change in both distance and arrangement
more often than head-to-head genes. These results indicate that selective pressure acts more strongly over evolutionary time to keep head-to-head genes together at the
1000 bp distance compared to tail-to-tail genes.
The data from the fish genomes indicated that very long
distances were necessary to capture a majority of the
human gene pairs. Given the compact nature of the fish
genomes, it is unlikely that many of these long distance
associations are biologically relevant. However, the preservation of tightly associated genes indicated the presence

Genes that were conserved across the four mammals had
a much larger range of functional activities. Of 342 pairs
of genes, catalytic activity emerged as the most significant
enrichment in any functional class (6.1E-4 after Benjamini correction). Thus bidirectional promoters are regulating many enzymes in mammalian genomes. In total,
58 functional classes were significantly enriched in this
dataset compared to a random collection of genes. These
data indicate that the regulatory domain of bidirectional
promoters has expanded to encompass a much larger set
of gene functions in mammals.
Training ESPERR to discriminate bidirectional promoters
Our previous work indicated that sequence-based characteristics were different in bidirectional promoters and
non-bidirectional promoters [7]. However the size of the
datasets was quite disparate (1,005 bidirectional, 17,613
non-bidirectional). Therefore for training ESPERR [8] we
sampled equal size subsets of 800 elements from each
class (keeping the remaining elements in each class as test
sets for verification). For each training interval we then
extracted genomic alignments of six species (human,
chimpanzee, macaque, mouse, rat, and dog) from the 17
species alignments available in the UCSC Genome
Browser. Regions of the training data overlapping coding
exons (from UCSC Known Genes) were masked out. We
first performed an unsupervised encoding selection (the
first stage of the ESPERR procedure) to create an encoding
in 10 symbols. Leave-one-out cross validation on the
training data using this encoding yielded a success rate of
76%. On the bidirectional test set, the model trained
using this mapping correctly classified 404 elements
(89%) and incorrectly classified 50 (17 elements were not
included due to insufficient alignment). On the non-bidirectional test set it successfully classified 11,150 elements
(70%), and incorrectly classified 4,845 (687 elements not
included). Next, we performed the full ESPERR procedure,
using the first stage reduction to produce an encoding of

size 75, which was then refined with the heuristic search
yielding an encoding of size 10. The resulting encoding
gave a modest improvement in cross-validation, with a
success rate of 82%. However, on the bidirectional test set,
the model using this encoding classified 405 elements
(89%) and incorrectly classified 49 (17 elements were
again not included due to insufficient alignment). On the
non-bidirectional test set it successfully classified 10,900
elements (68%), and incorrectly classified 5,095 (687 elements not included). Thus, using the ESPERR heuristic
search gives no improvement for classifying this dataset. It
is noteworthy that these classification rates, though modest, indicate that there are sequence and evolutionary patterns that can be captured to characterize bidirectional

promoters. Particularly interesting is the substantially
greater generalization rate for the bidirectional test set,
suggesting that there are more characteristic signals for
these elements that can be captured. This is consistent
with the result of the ESPERR heuristic search – optimizing the encoding using the training data gives a slight
improvement in recognizing the bidirectional test elements, but at the cost of poorer performance on the nonbidirectional test set.

Conclusion
Our study of bidirectional promoters across orthologous
regions of eight species provides a foundation for optimized annotations of these regulatory regions in higher

promoters show that a small subset of specialized func-

tions in chickens and fish was expanded in mammals to
include a wide breadth of activities. A common regulatory
mechanism is likely to exist that coordinately regulates

genes in these functional pathways. We continue to investigate the features associated with bidirectional promoters
using a classification procedure containing supervised
and unsupervised techniques. The results are promising in
that they indicate that bidirectional promoters have features consistent with learnable patterns.

Methods
Assigning orthologous regions
A multi-stage approach to mapping orthology at bidirectional promoters was developed. Because orthology
assignments are strongest in coding regions, we mapped
single human genes from head-to-head gene pairs to a second species. To identify orthologous DNA we used
"chains and nets" data from the UCSC Genome Browser
mysql tables. Chains in the Genome Browser represent
sequences of gapless aligned blocks. Nets provide a hierarchical ordering of those chains. Level 1 chains contain the
longest, best scoring sequence chains that span any
selected region. Gaps in the level 1 chains are recorded in
the level 2 chains (of the Browser mysql tables). This
ordering process is repeated until all aligned sequences are
assigned to a homologous human region. Odd number
levels represent aligned regions and even number levels

correspond to gapped regions separating the best scoring
chained alignments.
We used orthologous regions present in only level 1 and
excluded any other levels, which contain both paralogous
(duplicated during evolution) and orthologous
sequences. Level 1 alignments contain extremely long
stretches of genes in conserved synteny (i.e. same gene
identity and location) between species. The regions of
conserved sequence forming these alignment blocks are
separated by gaps that provide spacers between them. Frequently the aligned regions correspond to exons and
gapped regions correspond to introns and intergenic
regions. Given a human gene, our approach examined
whether it fell within an orthologous region defined by
level 1 alignment data without knowledge of the exact
position within an alignment or on which side of a gap. In
a subsequent step, we intersected the positions of gaps
and exons of each gene to (1) identify the orthologous
gene in the second species and (2) to determine how well
the exons align between species.
Mapping orthologous genes
After determining the orthology assignments using the
UCSC alignment data, we used the Ensembl annotations

[9] to search the identity of genes within each corresponding alignment. The appearance of several genes in the
same region was handled by choosing the candidate with
the closest transcription start site to its neighboring gene.
This technique identified the most likely gene pair for regulation by a bidirectional promoter. Orthology assignments were checked for each human gene individually,
and subsequently checked to see if the pairs from human
also formed pairs in the other species. Once orthologous
genes were identified for both human genes forming a
pair, the orthology assignments were checked in the
reverse direction from the other species to human.

gene orthology, because there were no breaks to separate
genes within the chained alignment region. To circumvent
this problem, we used the Liftover tool available at the
UCSC genome Browser. The Liftover software converted
the genomic coordinates from human to the second species using the genome alignment information at the
nucleotide level. This approach converted perfectly
aligned genes between human (hg17) and chimp, rhesus,
dog, mouse, chicken or zebrafish. Although Liftover data
is not available for Fugu, it appears that only 11 such genes
align perfectly to Fugu, which is a small enough number
to handle manually.

Eight species were used for orthology mapping in this
analysis including human, chimp, rhesus, dog, mouse,
chicken, Fugu and zebrafish. Each species has data in the
UCSC chains and nets data under the hg17 genome assembly, and Ensembl gene annotations. By examining the
presence of pairs of orthologous genes in 5 mammals and
3 additional vertebrates, we were able to identify the corresponding orthologous bidirectional promoter regions.
This information enabled our investigation of the role of
evolution in shaping bidirectional promoters and the
types of genes they regulate. Table 1 shows the number of
Ensembl gene annotations for each species for our analysis. Table 2 shows the number of orthologous genes that
correspond to human genes regulated by bidirectional
promoters.

Although a singular approach using the Liftover tool
could replace the procedure of using chains and nets to
more precisely identify each orthologous coordinate, we
chose to use it as a second phase in the mapping process.
In this way more information was retained from chains
and nets regarding how well each exon aligned and how
well all genes aligned when gapped regions were present.
The overall procedure appears in Figure 1.

Dealing with special cases
Some orthologous regions aligned perfectly over very long
distances in the second species without any gaps. This situation occurred most frequently in close evolutionary
comparisons, such as human to chimp or rhesus. The perfect alignments complicated our mapping of individual
