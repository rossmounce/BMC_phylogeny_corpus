Abstract
Background: In vertebrates, the molecular basis of the sense of smell is encoded by members of
a large gene family, namely olfactory receptor (OR) genes. Both the total number of OR genes and
the proportion of intact OR genes in a genome may indicate the importance of the sense of smell
for an animal. There is behavioral, physiological, and anatomical evidence that some bird species, in
particular nocturnal birds, have a well developed sense of smell. Therefore, we hypothesized that
nocturnal birds with good olfactory abilities have evolved (i) more OR genes and (ii) more intact
OR genes than closely related and presumably less 'olfaction-dependent' day-active avian taxa.
Results: We used both non-radioactive Southern hybridization and PCR with degenerate primers
to investigate whether two nocturnal bird species that are known to rely on olfactory cues, the
brown kiwi (Apteryx australis) and the kakapo (Strigops habroptilus), have evolved a larger OR gene
repertoire than their day-active, closest living relatives (for kiwi the emu Dromaius novaehollandiae,
rhea Rhea americana, and ostrich Struthio camelus and for kakapo the kaka Nestor meridionalis and
kea Nestor notabilis). We show that the nocturnal birds did not have a significantly higher proportion
of intact OR genes. However, the estimated total number of OR genes was larger in the two
nocturnal birds than in their relatives.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that ecological niche adaptations such as daily activity patterns
may have shaped avian OR gene repertoires.

Background
In vertebrates, the detection of odorous chemicals in both
air and water, is mediated by olfactory receptors (ORs)[1].
ORs are members of the superfamily of seven transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and are
expressed in olfactory neurons of the olfactory epithelium
[[1], for review, see [2]]. OR gene coding regions are short
(~1 kb) and intronless [1,2]. Both the total number and
the number of intact (i.e. putatively functional) OR genes
vary greatly amongst the genomes of vertebrate taxa [3].

For example, there are about 150 OR genes in the
zebrafish genome [4], 280 – 550 in the chicken genome
[5-7] and, typically, >1000 OR genes in mammalian
genomes [[7], for reviews, see [8,9]]. Amongst primates,
the proportion of intact OR genes is significantly reduced
in humans (~50%) when compared with other apes
(~70%) [[10,11], but see [12]], a finding hypothesized to
reflect decreasing behavioral reliance on the sense of smell
during human evolution. More generally, it has been suggested that the numbers, and proportions, of intact OR

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:117

genes in a vertebrate genome correlates with olfactory acuity at the behavioral level [3].
For birds, visual and auditory cues play important roles in
behaviors as diverse as foraging, mate attraction and territory defense [13,14]. However, the behavioral significance
of avian chemosensation is still debated. Increasing evidence, from both behavioral and morphological studies,
suggests that olfactory ability in at least some bird species,
in particular nocturnal birds, is excellent and may even be
equivalent to the olfactory abilities of mammals [[15], for
reviews, see [16-18]].
Concordantly with these studies the OR gene repertoire in
the red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus) genome, as estimated
from analysis of the draft G. gallus genomic sequence, is
surprisingly large, in the range of 220 – 550 OR paralogues [5-7]. More recent evidence suggests that both the
intact proportion (73 – 96%) and the estimated total
number (100 – 660 copies) of OR genes in the genomes
of nine distantly related avian species are much higher
than expected when working from the assumption that
birds have a poorly developed sense of smell [19]. Interestingly, the total number but not the proportion of intact
OR genes was correlated with olfactory bulb ratio
(OBR)[19], a possible morphological correlate of olfactory ability [20].
The aim of this study is to investigate the OR gene repertoires of two sets of closely related species, where one species in each group is nocturnal and known to rely on
olfactory cues. This work builds on a previous study,
where we examined the OR gene repertoires of distantly
related species [19]. The two nocturnal bird species are the
brown kiwi (Apteryx australis) and the kakapo (Strigops
habroptilus). Both night-active species are flightless and do
not have well-developed night vision or hearing [[21], R.J.
Moorhouse, pers. comm.], but do have a well-developed
sense of smell and relatively large olfactory bulbs [21-23].
Furthermore, the brown kiwi and kakapo belong to
entirely different evolutionary lineages, evolved their nocturnal behavior independently and have extant diurnal
relatives which facilitate comparative studies (brown kiwi
relatives: emu Dromaius novaehollandiae, rhea Rhea americana, ostrich Struthio camelus; kakapo relatives: kaka Nestor
meridionalis, kea Nestor notabilis). We hypothesized that
both nocturnal birds had evolved more OR genes and
more intact OR genes than their day-active relatives.
As genome sequences are not available for any avian species other than the red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus), we used
two complementary methods to estimate OR gene repertoire size. Southern hybridisation was used to provide a
relative measure of the number of OR gene sequences in
the avian genomes. While having the advantage of directly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/117

hybridising to the genomic DNA, Southern hybridisation
does not provide information about whether the hybridising sequences are intact genes or pseudogenes. Therefore, the PCR, using degenerate primers directed at the OR
gene family, and subsequent sequencing were used to estimate both the percentage of intact and the total number
of OR genes in the avian genomes. Both methods have
been used previously to estimate OR gene repertoire sizes
in fish [24,25], amphibians [26], birds [27,28] and mammals [29,30]. The OR gene repertoire estimates obtained
using these two methods were compared and interpreted
in the light of the evolutionary histories and ecological
adaptations of the brown kiwi and kakapo.

Methods
Blood samples collection
Blood samples for this study were kindly provided by
Gyula Gajdon (University of Vienna, Austria; kea),
Manuel García Hartmann (Duisburg zoo, Germany; elegant-crested tinamou), Ron Moorhouse (Department of
Conservation, New Zealand; kaka and kakapo), Gregor
Müller (Ulm zoo, Germany; rhea) and André Schüle (Berlin zoo, Germany; brown kiwi). Blood collection procedures conformed to the animal experimental ethics
regulations of the German Federal Republic, the European
Union and New Zealand. International transport of DNA
samples conformed to the legal requirements of the Convention on the International Trade of Endangered Species
(CITES).
PCR amplification of partial olfactory receptor (OR) genes
Blood samples were stored in Queen's lysis buffer before
genomic DNA was isolated using a commercial kit
(DNeasy tissue kit; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The design
of PCR primers to amplify avian OR partial coding
sequences has been described in detail in [19]. Briefly,
degenerate primers were designed to anneal to coding
sequences corresponding to evolutionarily conserved
sequence motifs within transmembrane (TM) regions 3
and TM 7 of ORs. As a subset of the avian ORs, termed γc, is greatly expanded in number within avian genomes,
two different sets of PCR primers were required; those targeting mainly the more diverse non-γ-c OR genes and
those mainly targeting the more homogenous γ-c OR
genes. To amplify non-γ-c OR sequences three different
forward primers were used in combination with three different reverse primers. Forward primers: 5'-ATG GCI TAY
GAY MGI TA-3' [31], 5'-GCI ATG GCI TAY GAY MGI TA3' [32] and 5'-ATG GCI TAY GAY MGI TAY STI GCI ATY
TG-3' [27]; reverse primers: 5'-TA DAT IAG IGG RTT IAG
CAT IGG-3' [19], 5'-AR ISW RTA DAT RAA IGG RTT-3'
[32] and 5'-GG RTT IAR CAT IGG-3' [31]. Amplifications
were conducted using each forward primer in combination with each reverse primer thereby generating nine different PCR products. The conserved sequence motif

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:117

within the TM3 region of the γ-c ORs differs significantly
from that of the non-γ-c ORs so alternative forward primers were required for amplifying γ-c OR partial coding
sequences [19]: forward primers: 5'-ATC TGY AAR CCI YTI
CAY TA-3' and 5'-RTT GCI ATY TGY AAR CCY CTR CAC
TA-3' which correspond to the γ-c OR TM3 motifs ICKPLHY and VAICKPLHY, respectively. The two γ-c OR forward primers were used in combination with the reverse
primer 5'-AR ISW RTA DAT RAA IGG RTT-3' [32] thereby
generating PCR products consisting largely of γ-c OR clade
sequences. All primer pairs were predicted to generate
products of approximately 0.5 kb which represents
approximately half the full OR coding sequence. The PCR
reaction conditions were: 2.0 mM Mg2+, dNTPs (0.1 mM);
primers (0.8 μM); 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (MBI Fermentas, St. Leon Rot, Germany) and genomic DNA (100
ng) template in a final volume of 50.0 μl with thermocycling parameters: 94°C/2 minutes, 1 cycle; 94°C/30 seconds; 37°C/30 seconds, ramping from 37°C to 72°C at
0.2°C/second; 72°C, 60 seconds; 5 cycles; 94°C/30 seconds; 45°C/30 seconds; 72°C, 60 seconds; 30 cycles;
72°C/7 minutes; 4°C/hold. Amplification products were
separated through 2% (w/v) agarose gels (Nusieve GTG
agarose, BioWhittaker Molecular Applications, Rockland,
U.S.A.) and products of ~0.5 kb cloned and sequenced as
described in [19]. Note that amplification products generated using the non-γ-c and the γ-c OR clade primers were
pooled using equal volume aliquots before the ligation
reaction. Therefore there were two ligations: one using the
nine non-γ-c amplicons and one using the two γ-c amplicons.
Sequence editing and analysis
Electropherograms were visually inspected and low-quality sequences discarded. PCR primer sequences were
deleted and sequences sharing ≥ 98.5% identity, determined using the Sequence Identity Matrix function of
BioEdit [33], were considered to be amplified from a single OR orthologue [19]. This procedure was used to
accommodate errors that may have been introduced during the amplification process. To confirm that the
sequences were partial OR coding sequences, each was
used as a query string in BLASTX searches of the GenBank
non-redundant (nr) database. Sequences were shifted into
the correct reading frame using a custom-written PERL
program. For each species, 50 individual clones were analyzed (25 clones derived by using each of primer pairs that
generally amplified the non-γ-c and the γ-c OR clade partial coding sequences).
Estimation of the proportion of intact OR genes and the
total number of OR genes
We designated a sequence as intact if an uninterrupted
coding region was found (i.e. sequence without stop

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/117

codon), and as a pseudogene when an interrupted coding
region was found (i.e. sequence containing a stop codon;
Gilad et al. 2004). Note that this method may overestimate the proportion of intact OR genes, because frameshift mutations located outside of the amplified partial
coding region (~TM3 – TM7) or in promoter regions will
not be detected [10,11]. In two cases, apparent amplicons
derived from the same gene were designated both intact
and pseudogene and these were excluded for the calculation of the proportion of intact OR genes but not for the
estimation of the total number of OR genes (see below).
Chi-square tests were calculated to compare the proportion of intact OR genes between the nocturnal birds and
their diurnal relatives using SPSS 15.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL,
USA).
As described previously in Steiger et al. (2008) [19], a
nonparametric estimation technique applying the concept of 'sample coverage" [34] was used to estimate the
total number of OR genes in each genome investigated.
This method estimates the total number of OR genes from
an incomplete sampling of OR genes (achieved via PCR).
In a first step, the number of times identical PCR products
were re-sequenced was used to estimate sample coverage
(C) and its coefficient of variation (CV). In a second step,
we chose the appropriate coverage estimator (ACE1)
given the information provided by C and CV. This
method does not assume an equal probability for each
gene to be cloned and thus accounts for primer bias.
Abundance coverage estimators, their standard errors,
confidence intervals and related statistics for all species
were calculated using the software SPADE [35] and can be
found in Additional file 1. In a previous study, we estimated the jungle fowl OR gene repertoire to consist of 638
genes [19], which was close to the previous estimate of
550 [7]. This suggested that our method provides a sufficiently reliable estimate of OR gene repertoire sizes in species for which full genomic sequences are not yet
available.
We did not estimate the functional OR repertoire size
because the two estimated variables required to calculate
it (i.e. the total number of OR genes and the proportion
of those that are intact) already have substantial measurement errors, so that their multiplication would lead to an
even more uncertain estimate. Instead, we use the total
number of OR genes as a proxy for the number of functional OR genes. This is meaningful, because in vertebrates the total number of OR genes correlates positively
with the total number of intact OR genes (see Additional
file 2).
To show that the estimates for the kakapo and the kiwi
were significantly higher than those of their relatives, 1-

tailed t-tests were conducted (psittaciform comparison:
kakapo vs. kea, kakapo vs. kaka; paleognath comparison:
brown kiwi vs. emu, brown kiwi vs. ostrich, brown kiwi
vs. rhea). Subsequently, Fisher's method [36] was used to
obtain a single p-value for each comparison.
Southern Hybridization
Genomic DNA (10 μg) was digested with each of four
restriction endonucleases (EcoRI, PstI, HindIII and TaqI;
Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) and the digestion
products separated via electrophoresis through 0.8% agarose gels before transfer to positively-charged nylon membranes (Roche, Germany; Whatman Schleicher & Schuell,
Dassel, Germany) using a vacuum blotting system (VacuGeneXL; Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) following the manufacturers instructions. Ethidium bromide
staining was used to confirm that equivalent amounts of
total digested genome DNA were loaded in each lane.

For a comparative Southern hybridization study, such as
this, is critical that the labeled probes used for the hybridizations are derived from an 'outgroup' taxon that, while
related, is evolutionarily equidistant from all the genomes
being compared. Therefore, based on the phylogenetic
tree topologies [37,38] shown schematically in Figure 1,
OR probes were generated from the elegant-crested
tinamou (Eudromia elegans; fam. Tinamiformes, outgroup
to the ratites) and the galah (Elophus roseicapillus; fam.
Cacatuidae, outgroup to the Nestoridae), respectively.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/117

Note that a recent study places the tinamou within the
ratites [39] and that kakapo have also been classified as
the sole member of a distinct family Strigopidae [40]. For
probe generation, partial OR coding sequences were
amplified using the degenerated primers targeting the
non-γ-c OR genes (see above) and cloned into pGemTeasy. Plasmids were digested with EcoRI (Fermentas, St.
Leon-Rot, Germany) and the inserts isolated from agarose
gels (QIAquick Gel Extraction kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and labeled with digoxigenin (DIG) using a commercial kit (DIG high prime DNA Labeling and Detection
Starter Kit I, Roche, Germany).
OR partial coding sequences amplified from the tinamou
and galah were aligned with 78 known, putatively functional G. gallus OR receptor genes. [from ref [7], sequences
listed in Supporting data set 8, http://www.pnas.org/cgi/
content/full/0501922102/DC1/13] using ClustalW [41].
For the alignment, G. gallus nucleotide sequences between
transmembrane domain (TM) 3 and TM7 were used. We
used the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method and Poisson-distances to construct phylogenetic trees using the MEGA
software package (version 4.0; [42,43]). The reliability of
the phylogeny was evaluated with 1000 bootstrap repeats.
Four tinamou and three galah OR partial coding
sequences were selected from divergent regions of the OR
gene family for use as Southern hybridization probes. The
selected probes were denoted, along with their corresponding GenBank accession numbers, Tin-A [GenBank:
EU599489], Tin-B [GenBank: EU599490], Tin-C [GenBank: EU599491], Tin-D [GenBank: EU599492] and GalA [GenBank: EU599486], Gal-B [GenBank: EU599487]
and Gal-C [GenBank: EU599488] (Figure 2). Identities of
the probe nucleotide sequences ranged between 49 – 66%
and therefore were considered lower than the threshold of
cross-hybridization under the hybridisation conditions
used [44] (Additional file 3).
Blots were hybridized with ~25 ng/ml probe overnight at
37°C and/or 42°C. Note that due to the limited amount
of genomic DNA available from the kakapo we conducted
Southern blots comparing the OR gene repertoire of the
kakapo, kea and kaka only at 42°C hybridization temperatures and thus, under more conservative conditions.

together on the same gels. Thus the EcoRI/HindIII and
TaqI/PstI results arise from different gels/blots/hybridizations. Therefore, it is valid to compare the results for different species within a given enzyme/probe combination.

Results
Estimation of the total number of OR genes
The total numbers of distinct OR sequences amplified
using degenerate PCR primers, with the seven avian
genomes as templates varied between 22 and 42 (Table 1)
[GenBank: EU594675 – EU594890; EU599486 –
EU599492, for more details, see Additional file 4]. The
mean number of distinct OR sequences was similar in
both clades (mean ± SEM: Paleognathae: 32 ± 4, Psittaciformes: 30 ± 5).

The estimated total number of OR genes in each genome
varied between 55 and 478 (Table 1). The estimated OR
gene repertoires of the nocturnal species (kakapo and
kiwi) were 5 to 8 times larger than those found in their
diurnal closest relatives (Table 1). The estimate for the
brown kiwi was significantly higher than that of its relatives (Fisher's combined p = 0.047). Similarly, there was a
strong trend for the kakapo to have a larger OR gene repertoire than its relatives (Fisher's combined p = 0.060).

Estimation of the proportions of potentially intact OR
genes
Among the paleognath species the proportions of intact
OR genes did not differ significantly (mean ± SEM: 79.6%
± 1.9%; χ2 = 0.7, df = 3, P = 0.87). Although the mean proportion of intact OR genes was similar in the three psittaciform genomes (79.9% ± 7.5%), the proportions differed
significantly between the three species (χ2 = 6.3, df = 2, P
= 0.04). Notably, the proportion of intact OR genes was
significantly higher in the kea and kaka genomes than in
the kakapo (Table 1). The lower estimated percentage of
intact OR genes in the kakapo genome reflects the large
number of pseudogenes (12) amplified from the kakapo
γ-c OR clade (Table 1).
Comparison of OR gene repertoire sizes using Southern
blot hybridization
A) Southern hybridizations of palaeognath genomes
Genomic DNA samples isolated from brown kiwi, emu,
greater rhea, ostrich and elegant-crested tinamou (positive
control) blood samples were digested with four different
restriction enzymes and transferred to a filter before
hybridization (37°C), with the OR probes, Tin-A, B, C
and D (Figure 3). Quantitative comparisons of the
number of bands labeled in different species, and different hybridizations, proved problematic. Therefore the
Southern hybridization results were interpreted qualitatively.

The Tin-A probe labeled the most bands in the emu DNA
with broadly similar numbers of bands detected in the
kiwi, ostrich and rhea DNA (Figure 3A). As expected, the
fragments of tinamou DNA were most strongly labeled
(Figure 3A).
The Tin-B probe labeled, with low intensity, few rhea and
ostrich DNA fragments (Figure 3B). In contrast, the
tinamou, emu and kiwi DNA had a number of strongly
labeled bands. In particular the TaqI and PstI digested kiwi
DNA revealed a number of strongly labeled fragments
(Figure 3B). The Tin-C probe labeled multiple bands in all
four genomes. However, labeling of the kiwi and emu
DNA fragments appears the most intense with an indication of there being more labeled fragments in the kiwi
DNA (Figure 3C). It is noteworthy that the Tin-A and TinC probes generated entirely different banding patterns
despite being placed quite close together on the OR phylogenetic tree and sharing 66% sequence identity (Figure
2). The Tin-D probe, which encodes a γ-c OR partial
sequence, generated more bands than the other three Tin
probes when hybridized with the DNA of all four species
(Figure 3D). Indeed both the kiwi and emu DNA samples
appear to have so many hybridizing fragments that the
result is a smear (Figure 3D). Overall the kiwi DNA
appears much more intensively labeled than that of the
other species with emu DNA the second most intensively
labeled. Somewhat surprisingly, given that the probes
used were derived from tinamou, the tinamou DNA is the
least intensely labeled of the four species (Figure 3D).

B) Southern hybridizations of psittaciform genomes
Genomic DNA isolated from kakapo, kea, kaka and galah
blood was digested with four different restriction enzymes
and transferred to a filter before hybridization at 42°C
with three galah OR gene probes, Gal-A, B and C (Figure
2).

In all four pssitaciform taxa, multiple fragments of varying
intensity were labeled with the Gal-A and Gal-B probes
(Figure 4A, B). The fragment labeling patterns for the kea
and the kaka are strikingly similar for both probes with all
four restriction enzymes reflecting the close evolutionary
relationship of these congeneric species (Figure 4A, B). In
contrast, the fragment patterns of the kakapo, are quite
distinct from those of the kea and kaka, particularly in the
TaqI and PstI digests (Figure 4A, B). Overall the kakapo
lanes appear to contain more bands or, in the case of the
TaqI/Gal-B combination, a much more intense band than
the kea and kaka or, indeed, the positive control galah
(Figure 4A, B).
The Gal-C probe labeled the largest number of bands
when hybridized to all four pssitaciform genomes (Figure
4C), which is consistent with its placement within the
large γ-c clade (Figure 2). It would appear that the intensity of the 'smear' in the kakapo lanes is stronger than in
the other taxa samples (Figure 4C). This difference is perhaps most prominent in the TaqI digested samples where
the intensity of the hybridization to the kakapo DNA is
clearly stronger than to the kea, kaka and even the galah.

five palaeognath taxa (ostrich, emu, brown kiwi, greater rhea, elegant-crested tinamou) were digested with four different
restriction enzymes and used for Southern hybridization with four DIG-labeled probes generated from elegant-crested
tinamou partial OR coding sequences: (A) probe Tin-A [GenBank: EU599489], (B) probe Tin-B [GenBank: EU599490], (C)
probe Tin-C [GenBank: EU599491] and (D) probe Tin-D [GenBank: EU599492]. 37°C hybridization conditions were used for
the results shown. Abbreviations: T, TaqI; P, PstI; E, EcoRI; H, HindIII; DIG, digoxigenin; Tin, elegant-crested tinamou. Approximate positions of the size standards (kb) are indicated. Note that each figure was generated by splicing together images from
two separate blots (see Methods for details).
The observed inter-taxa differences in hybridization intensities cannot be attributed to differences in the amounts of
DNA loaded on the gels as because ethidium bromide
staining of the gels revealed little differences in DNA
quantities/labeling intensities between lanes (data not
shown).

Discussion
The majority of OR partial coding sequences amplified in
this study did not contain stop codons, suggesting that

they were derived from potentially functional OR genes.
Indeed the degree of interspecific variation in the proportion of intact genes appears to be small. This is consistent
with previous work, which showed a high (~80%) proportion of intact OR genes in nine bird genomes from
seven different orders, including the brown kiwi and the
kakapo [19]. The estimate of the proportion of intact
genes in the kakapo genome was higher in our previous
study (i.e. 82% versus 68% in this study), possibly due to
the slightly different method used (the PCR products were

size can be expected. Second, in mammals, OR gene repertoire sizes range from 606 OR genes in the macaque to
2129 OR genes in the cow [3]. Thus, OR gene repertoire
sizes also vary greatly among mammalian species.

[GenBank: EU599487] and (C) probe Gal-C [GenBank:
EU599488]. 42°C hybridization temperatures were used for

pooled in this study and thus there were two ligation reactions, whereas previously they were not pooled and there
were twelve ligation reactions). Notably, the estimates
obtained from the two different procedures are not significantly different (χ2 = 2.3, df = 1, P = 0.12).
If the proportion of intact OR genes is an indicator of
olfactory ability, one would expect nocturnal birds with
good olfactory abilities to encode a higher proportion of
intact OR genes than related, but diurnal species. Contrary
to this hypothesis, we found that (i) the estimated proportion of intact OR genes were lower for the nocturnal
kakapo than for the kea and the kaka and (ii) did not differ between the brown kiwi and its diurnal relatives. However, the estimated total number of OR genes was 5 to 8
times larger in the two nocturnal species than in their
diurnal relatives, even though our estimate of the kakapo
OR gene repertoire was smaller than in the previous study
[19]. The observed differences in OR gene repertoire sizes
are remarkable, but perhaps not surprising for the following two reasons. First, birds also show remarkable interspecific variation in the size of the olfactory bulb (OBR)
(relative to brain size). The OBR is the ratio of the greatest
diameter of the olfactory bulb relative to the greatest
diameter of the cerebral hemisphere, expressed as a percentage [22]. For example, the OBR in the Snow petrel,
Pagodroma nivea, is twelve times larger (37%) than in the
Black-capped chickadee, Poecile atricapillus (3%) [22].
Thus, similar interspecific variation in OR gene repertoire

In agreement with our previous study [19], our data suggest a positive correlation between the relative size of the
olfactory bulb and the number of OR genes. It appears
that it is the total number of OR genes, rather than the
proportion of intact OR genes, that is most closely linked
with olfactory dependency in the bird species examined
here. Our results therefore support the notion that the
proportion of intact OR genes "is not always a good criterion for the study of the evolution of OR genes" [45].
Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that OR pseudogenes are expressed in the olfactory epithelium in
humans, suggesting that pseudogenes may have a biological function [46]. These results imply that future studies
should investigate both intact OR genes and pseudogenes
more carefully [45].
The results of the Southern blot analyses, while only qualitative, generally agree with the estimates of OR gene
numbers based on PCR. Both nocturnal species showed
generally more or stronger bands than their diurnal closest relatives. In general, variable band intensity is presumed to reflect varying levels of sequence homology
between the "target" and probe sequences. However, the
fact that the intensity of hybridization to the kakapo and
brown kiwi DNA is much stronger than that to the galah
and the tinamou (i.e. the species from which the probes
were derived) suggests that multiple kakapo and brown
kiwi sequences hybridized with the probes. This was particularly clear in the expanded γ-c OR gene clade, indicating that at least in this clade the two nocturnal species
have a greater total number of OR genes.
In this study, two molecular techniques, the PCR and
Southern hybridization, were used to compare the numbers of OR genes, both intact and non-functional,
encoded in seven avian genomes. Both techniques have
their limitations. Firstly, the PCR, using degenerate primers, may overestimate the number of intact OR genes, as
these may have stronger conservation of primer annealing
sites than do non-functional pseudogenes [10]. Secondly,
only half of the OR open reading frame (ORF) was amplified and sequenced and therefore, mutations occurring in
the remaining N- and C-termed coding regions would not
be detected. Finally, due to unpredictable primer bias,
some OR genes may amplify preferentially relative to others. Thus, the ratios of OR partial coding sequences
amongst the amplification products may not represent a
random sample of the OR repertoires in the template
DNA [10,11]. The limitation of the Southern blot method
is that it only estimates the number of OR genes in a given

subfamily and does not provide information about the
functionality of these genes.
Olfactory receptor genes evolve dynamically via duplication and/or gene conversion in a process that has been
called 'birth and death evolution' [3,47]. Why would it be
advantageous for a nocturnal bird to have evolved more,
and perhaps more diverse, olfactory receptor genes? It has
been suggested that the more OR genes encoded in an
organism's genome the finer the animal's discrimination
amongst odor molecules is [4]. Thus, differences in the
size of the OR gene repertoire may cause different odor
sensitivities among birds. A wide receptor repertoire is
also likely to allow binding/detection of many, structurally-diverse, 'odorous' compounds [48]. Thus, a nocturnal
bird that has evolved more OR genes might be able to
smell more diverse odorants than a diurnal bird that lives
in the same habitat. Thus higher numbers of OR genes
may contribute to the ability of nocturnal species to locate
food at night via olfactory cues [23,49]. Before the relatively recent colonization of New Zealand by humans,
this archipelago lacked terrestrial mammalian predators
[50]. It is therefore perhaps not surprising that these nocturnal birds have adapted to the ecological niche usually
occupied by mammals elsewhere. This includes the development of such mammalian-like characteristic as reliance
upon olfactory information [21]. It should be noted that
the ability to detect odorants most likely does not only
rely on the number of OR genes, but also on differences in
olfactory epithelium size and in the number of olfactory
neurons [8]. Unfortunately, very little information exists
about these traits in birds [for review, see [16]].
In addition to a role in foraging, birds also use olfactory
abilities in a variety of other contexts such as navigation
[51,52], predator detection [53], nest-building [54,55]
and conspecific and mate recognition [56]. Furthermore,
birds seem to lack both the vomeronasal organ and vomeronasal receptors, which are thought to mediate social
chemo-communication in mammals [5]. Thus, it remains
to be shown whether and how birds detect pheromones.
The recent observation that pheromones can be detected
by both the vomeronasal and olfactory epithelia in mammals is striking [57], because this implies that avian pheromones, if they exist, could potentially act via the
conventional sense of smell (i.e. olfactory epithelia and
ORs). Alternatively, trace amine-associated receptors
(TAARs), a new class of "olfactory" receptors could be relevant for avian social communication and individual recognition [58,59].
Interestingly, the olfactory anatomy is also well developed
in procellariiform seabirds (petrels, albatrosses and shearwaters) and olfactory cues such as krill-related odors or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/117

odors associated with phytoplankton play an important
role in foraging behavior [22,60]. So far, procellariiform
OR genes have received little attention [19]. Therefore,
future studies could investigate whether the reliance on
olfactory cues in seabirds is reflected in their OR gene repertoires. For example, it would be interesting to determine
whether burrowing petrels that return to their nest at
night have evolved a larger OR gene repertoire than surface-nesting petrels that rather rely on visual cues to recognize their nest [61].
Besides enhancement of the olfactory system, some nocturnal birds have compensated for the reduced effectiveness of vision at night by an enhanced sense of vision (e.g.
owls (Koenig, Becking, 1999), or by increasing other
capacities such as hearing (owls, (Koenig, Becking, 1999))
or echolocation (oilbirds and swiftlets) (Konishi, Knudsen, 1979; Medway, 1959). Further work could also
address whether nocturnal birds that invested in
enhanced visual or auditory perception have smaller
olfactory receptor repertoires, which would suggest a
trade-off between investments in vision versus olfaction.

Conclusion
In summary, our data indicate that the OR gene repertoires are larger in the genomes of two nocturnal bird species than in their most closely related, but diurnal, species.
Such results confirm and extend previous behavioral studies suggesting that some nocturnal bird species have a
well-developed sense of smell. Our results strongly suggest that ecological niche adaptations such as daily activity
patterns, and associated sensory changes, may have
shaped, or been shaped by, avian OR gene repertoires. In
general our results support the growing consensus that
birds – in common with mammals – may rely on their
sense of smell in a variety of important life-history contexts.
