Abstract
Background: There have been reported cases of host-switching in avian and lizard species of
Plasmodium (Apicomplexa, Haemosporidia), as well as in those infecting different primate species.
However, no evidence has previously been found for host-swapping between wild birds and
mammals.
Methods: This paper presents the results of the sampling of blood parasites of wild-captured bats
from Madagascar and Cambodia. The presence of Haemosporidia infection in these animals is
confirmed and cytochrome b gene sequences were used to construct a phylogenetic analysis.
Results: Results reveal at least three different and independent Haemosporidia evolutionary
histories in three different bat lineages from Madagascar and Cambodia.
Conclusion: Phylogenetic analysis strongly suggests multiple host-switching of Haemosporidia
parasites in bats with those from avian and primate hosts.

Background
Plasmodium falciparum (Apicomplexa, Haemosporidia),
the most dangerous of human malaria parasites, is
responsible for at least one million deaths a year [1]. It has
been suggested that its exceptional virulence, compared to
the three other species of human Plasmodium, is due to its
relatively recent host-shift from birds to humans and the

short period for the latter to adapt to the parasite [2].
Given the heavy burden of P. falciparum on human populations around the tropics [3], there is a critical need to
better understand the origin and evolution of this parasite
and related organisms. Plasmodium falciparum belongs to a
group that also infects a considerable range of birds, squamates, crocodilians, chelonians and non-human mam-

mals [4]. These parasites are known to be virulent,
invasive pathogens in a variety of wild animals and contribute to the parasite burden of natural populations,
including several threatened species [5]. Host switching
by these parasites could be the trigger for emerging virulent diseases [6-8].
Madagascar and Cambodia are two biodiversity "hot
spots" [9]. The faunas of these areas, which are, in evolutionary terms, distant from one another, provide an attractive system for characterizing haemosporidian parasite
species [10,11] and for evaluating host-parasite co-evolution and exchange. Madagascar was part to the Gondwana
continent and was separated 160 million and 90 million
years ago from Africa and from India, respectively;
whereas, Cambodia originated from the Laurasia continent.
The paper presents the result of the screening of over 500
bats belonging to seven families from different field sites
in Madagascar and Cambodia. Haemosporidia parasites
were isolated in the bat families, Hipposideridae, Vespertilionidae and Megadermatidae. Molecular sequences of
bat haemosporidian parasites were not previously available. Herein, the phylogenetic analyses with cytochrome b
mitochondrial gene sequences illustrate the first documented example of a cross-class host-switching of
haemosporidian parasites between birds and mammals.

Methods
Field sites and sample collection
Screened material was obtained in Madagascar and Cambodia. In Madagascar, specimens were obtained at eight
different field sites in the provinces of Mahajanga, Toliara
and Antananarivo. The fieldwork was conducted between
November 2001 and late 2004, in collaboration with the
Institut Pasteur de Madagascar and WWF-Madagascar. In
Cambodia, two field sites were sampled in the provinces
of Kampot and Mondolkiri between December 2004 and
May 2006, in collaboration with the Institut Pasteur du
Cambodia and Wildlife Conservation Society. The field
research was conducted with local and national permits
from the Direction des Eaux et Forêts of Madagascar and
the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in Cambodia. A total of 530 bats, belonging to seven families
(Pteropodidae, Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae, Megadermatidae, Emballonuridae, Vespertilionidae, and
Molossidae) were trapped in the wild. A small sample of
blood was obtained and the host was released without
injury or in some cases retained as a voucher specimen.
Microscopic examination
Thin blood smears were made for each animal. They were
fixed in methanol and stained by incubation with 10%
Giemsa for 10 minutes. The smears were examined by

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/6/1/157

microscopy for haemosporidian parasites. Parasites isolated from bats were referred to as Haemosporidia sp. Positive blood smears were catalogued in the Département
'Régulations, Développement et Diversité Moléculaire',
Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, France.
DNA extraction and amplification
DNA was extracted from blood samples using the phenol/
chloroform technique [12]. The 709 bp cytochrome b
fragments were amplified using PCR and nested-PCR. The
PCR reaction was carried out in a total volume of 25 µl
under the following condition: 1 µl of each of the primers:
PLAS 1 (5'-GAGAATTATGGAGTGGATGGTG-3') and
PLAS 2 (5'-GTGGTAATTGACATCCWATCC-3'), 1 mM of
each dNTP, 1 U of Taq polymerase (Solis), 3 mM MgCl2.
The PCR conditions were: 5 min at 94°C, 30 sec at 94°C,
30 sec at 55°C and 1 min 30 sec at 72°C for 40 cycles and
a final 10 min extension at 72°C. The nested-PCR was carried out using 1 µl of the PCR products and performed
with the following primers: PLAS 3 (5'-GGTGTTTYAGATAYATGCAYGC-3') and PLAS 4 (5'-CATCCWATCCATARTAWAGCATAG-3'). The conditions were: 5 min at 94°C,
30 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at 55°C, 1 min 30 sec at 72°C for
40 cycles and a final 10 min extension at 72°C. The PCR
products were sequenced using PLAS3 and PLAS4 primers
by Macrogen (Korea). All of these primers were designed
by the research group. They are specific to haemosporidian parasites and do not amplify others Apicomplexa parasites or host DNA. Relevant sequences were selected for
the phylogenetic analysis. There are numerous avian parasite sequences available and some representative
sequences were chosen based on geographical localizations.
Phylogenetic analyses
The nucleotide sequences (709 bp) were translated into
amino acid sequences to minimize homoplasy due to saturation of synonymous mutations since some taxa have
diverged over hundreds of millions years. The sequences
were aligned using CLUSTAL W [13]. Reference sequences
of at least 219 amino acids without ambiguous positions
were retrieved from GenBank. In the case of identical
sequences in amino acids, only one sequence for the analysis was kept. Maximum Likelihood (ML) was performed
using Phyml [14] and Parsimony analysis (P) was performed using Phylip package (version 3.62) [15]. Nodal
robustness was evaluated by non-parametric bootstrap
(100 replicates). Bayesian analyses were conducted with
MrBayes V3.1 software [16] using gamma distribution, 1
000 000 generations (average standard deviation of split
sequences is below 0.01), with tree sampling every 100
generations and a burn-in of 2500 trees. The aim of the
study was to analyse Haemosporidia phylogeny, so Theileria annulata, Babesia gibsoni and Toxoplasma gondii which
belong to the phylum Apicomplexa but are non-haemos-

poridian parasites were choose as out-groups. The phylogenetic study was run using cytochrome b sequences. This
is the most abundant marker in GenBank for a variety of
haemosporidian parasites and widely used in phylogenetic studies because reference sequences from other
genes are lacking.

Results
530 blood samples were collected in Madagascar and in
Cambodia belonging to seven families of bats. Haemos-

poridian infections were identified in three families: Hipposideridae, Vespertilionidae and Megadermatidae (Table
1 and Table 2). All the cytochrome b sequences that were
isolated from these bats were previously unpublished and
the parasite taxa, the host names, the collection localities
and the GenBank accession numbers are given in Table 3.
The three phylogenetic methods used, Parsimony (P),
Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian analyses produced the same tree topology. The phylogeny is presented
in Figure 1.

The results show the existence of two clades within
Haemosporidia, separating mammal and sauropsid hosts
(birds and lizards) (1.00 Bayesian posterior probabilities,
99 and 100 for ML and P respectively bootstrap support).
In the first clade, the four malaria parasites afflicting
humans, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum form a polyphyletic
group [17]. Rodent Plasmodium are the sister group and
P. falciparum still exhibits a deep branch. Interestingly,
parasite isolated from the bat Hipposideros larvatus

(Family Hipposideridae) (Figures 2 and 3) clusters with a
Hepatocystis parasite obtained from a baboon (Papio sp.)
and falls within the Plasmodium primate group (Bayesian
posterior probabilities of 1.00 and bootstrap support of
99 and 96 for ML and P, respectively).
In the second clade, between two clades of Plasmodium,
are Leucocytozoon and Haemoproteus, two genera infecting
only sauropsid hosts, and are close sister taxa of bird and
lizard Plasmodium [18]. This renders the genus Plasmodium

probabilities [16] (value less then 0.5 not shown), below are bootstrap percentage obtained by maximum likelihood [14] (left of

polyphyletic. Unexpectedly, the haemosporidian parasite
isolated from the bat Megaderma spasma (Family Megadermatidae) (Figure 4) is included within the sauropsid Plasmodium clade. However, the bootstrap value is low
(Bayesian posterior probabilities of 0.62). Remarkably,
haemosporidian parasites isolated from the Malagasy
endemic bats Myotis goudoti and Miniopterus manavi and
the parasite isolated from the widespread Asiatic bat
Kerivoula hardwickii (Figure 5) form a monophyletic cluster and fall within the sauropsid Plasmodium clade. All
these bats are classically placed in the Family Vespertilionidae. This result is well support with 0.75 Bayesian posterior probabilities and 75 ML bootstrap.

Discussion
The mitochondrial genome is more conserved in apicomplexan parasites [19] than in others metazoan eukaryotes.

Cytochrome b gene is, therefore, a good marker to establish phylogenetic relationships between parasites that
diverged several millions years ago [18].
The presence of a major division within haemosporidian
parasites separating mammal and sauropsid hosts, suggests that parasites of these two vertebrate groups evolved
separately. In the mammalian clade of parasites, except
for P. falciparum, all primate Plasmodium species share a
common ancestor, although host shifts occurred during
the course of primate speciation. Indeed, wild primate
populations are potential reservoirs for human malaria
parasites [8]and host shifts have occurred in Southeast
Asia with, for example, Plasmodium knowlesi, which usually infect macaques, afflicting humans [20]. Recently evidence on the origin of P. vivax as a macaque monkey
malaria parasite in Southeast Asia has been proposed

[7,21]. In addition, Plasmodium simium and Plasmodium
brasilianum, two species infecting South American platyrrhini primates, are genetically indistinguishable from P.
vivax and P. malariae, respectively, and may have been
associated with a human-platyrrhini host-switch [8,21].
Further, haemosporidian parasite isolated from Hipposideros larvatus clusters with a baboon Hepatocystis. This
association between bat and primate parasites has been
previously proposed based on mitochondrial data, where
a Hepatocystis species isolated from a bat (Cynopterus brachyotis, Family Pteropodidae) clusters with this baboon

Hepatocystis [4]. Needless to say, this result is not congruent with mammal phylogeny [22] and suggests a host
switch from primates to bats.
In the sauropsid clade, the evolutionary history of Plasmodium that infects birds and lizards is not resolved. The parasite phylogeny clearly does not fit with the host
phylogeny. Plasmodium parasites from birds and lizards
are known to show little host specificity [23]. Previous
conclusions support that infrequent and unpredictable
host shifts have occurred in the parasite-host sauropsid
system [24]. Surprisingly, the Haemosporidia isolated
from Megaderma spasma in Cambodia falls within the sau-

ropsid Plasmodium clade. However, phylogenetic relationships between the parasites of Megaderma and sauropsids
are not completely resolved.
Furthermore, closely related haemosporidian parasites
isolated from Myotis goudoti and Miniopterus manavi, two
endemic Malagasy bat species and the haemosporidian
parasite from the Cambodian Kerivoula hardwickii, all of
which are placed in the family Vespertilionidae, fall
within the sauropsid Plasmodium clade. This result clearly
does not fit with vertebrate phylogeny and supports host
switching from birds to bats. The haemosporidian vespertilionid parasites from Madagascar and Cambodia are
monophyletic, which suggest that the host switching took
place in the early evolutionary history of these bats and
was followed by subsequent radiation and co-speciation.
This is the first report showing host switching in haemosporidian parasites between birds and mammals (bats).
After rodents, bats are the largest order of mammals (at
least 1,100 species, more than 20% of extant mammal
species). The Chiroptera are very diverse and they are distributed almost worldwide and have extremely diverse life
history traits and morphology. Based on recent molecular
work, they are classified into four super-families that
apparently diversified in different areas during the early
Eocene as a "Big Bang" radiation [25] coincident with the
peak of Tertiary insect diversity [26]. In developing echolocation and different flight strategies, the ancestors of
modern bats colonized various ecological niches [27],
where birds and their associated blood parasites are
thought to have been present, thus favoring host switching from birds to bats. Furthermore, Myotis goudoti and
Miniopterus manavi often share common day roost sites in
tree hollows, caves and rock shelters [28], which expose
considerable numbers of densely packed individuals to
the same potential blood parasite vectors.

evidence presented herein of host switching between
birds and bats, it is difficult to reject the hypothesis that P.
falciparum has a non-primate origin. It may have emerged
in humans associated with an ancient host switching and,
as such, it could be one of the oldest "emerging" diseases
in humans.

Conclusion
The introduction of the 7 new genetic sequences from chiropteran hemoparasites does not alter the deep branching
of P. falciparum within the mammalian clade [4,17]. This
result does not support a recent parasite transfer from
birds to Homo sapiens, which has been used to explain the
pathogenicity of P. falciparum in humans. Rather, the
nearly exponential recent growth in human populations
may have acted on P. falciparum selection patterns [29].
However, the sequence data from blood parasites isolated
from bats provide further insights into the possible evolutionary pathway of human malaria parasites. Those results
show that P. falciparum has a different and independent
evolutionary history than other human malaria parasites.
This is consistent with recent studies providing genetic
evidence that the four human parasites did not emerge
from the same geographical region [30]. Based on clear
