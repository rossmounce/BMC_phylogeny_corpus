Abstract
Background: GB virus C (GBV-C) is an enveloped positive-sense ssRNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family.
Studies on the genetic variability of the GBV-C reveals the existence of six genotypes: genotype 1 predominates in
West Africa, genotype 2 in Europe and America, genotype 3 in Asia, genotype 4 in Southwest Asia, genotype 5 in
South Africa and genotype 6 in Indonesia. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and genotypic
distribution of GBV-C in the Colombian population.
Methods: Two groups were analyzed: i) 408 Colombian blood donors infected with HCV (n = 250) and HBV (n =
158) from Bogotá and ii) 99 indigenous people with HBV infection from Leticia, Amazonas. A fragment of 344 bp
from the 5’ untranslated region (5’ UTR) was amplified by nested RT PCR. Viral sequences were genotyped by
phylogenetic analysis using reference sequences from each genotype obtained from GenBank (n = 160). Bayesian
phylogenetic analyses were conducted using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to obtain the MCC tree
using BEAST v.1.5.3.
Results: Among blood donors, from 158 HBsAg positive samples, eight 5.06% (n = 8) were positive for GBV-C and
from 250 anti-HCV positive samples, 3.2%(n = 8) were positive for GBV-C. Also, 7.7% (n = 7) GBV-C positive samples
were found among indigenous people from Leticia. A phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of the following
GBV-C genotypes among blood donors: 2a (41.6%), 1 (33.3%), 3 (16.6%) and 2b (8.3%). All genotype 1 sequences
were found in co-infection with HBV and 4/5 sequences genotype 2a were found in co-infection with HCV. All
sequences from indigenous people from Leticia were classified as genotype 3. The presence of GBV-C infection
was not correlated with the sex (p = 0.43), age (p = 0.38) or origin (p = 0.17).
Conclusions: It was found a high frequency of GBV-C genotype 1 and 2 in blood donors. The presence of
genotype 3 in indigenous population was previously reported from Santa Marta region in Colombia and in native
people from Venezuela and Bolivia. This fact may be correlated to the ancient movements of Asian people to
South America a long time ago.

Background
GB virus C/Hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV) is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-strand RNA virus belonging
to the family Flaviviridae with a genomic size of about
9.3 Kb [1]. It is genomic organization mainly consists of a
large open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a single

polyprotein precursor in which the structural (E1 and E2)
and nonstructural proteins (NS2 to NS5B) are positioned
at the N-terminal and C-terminal end, respectively [2]. It
was first identified in 1995 in serum from individuals
with idiopathic hepatitis [3]. Although it was initially
identified as a possible etiological agent of viral hepatitis
in humans, and despite its similarity in genome structure
with hepatitis C virus (HCV), in contrast to HCV, GBVC does not appear to be a hepatotrophic virus neither

replicates in hepatocytes nor causes acute or chronic
hepatitis [4-6].
GBV-C can be transmitted parenterally through blood
and derivates transfusion, intravenous drug use, hemodialysis and vertical transmission [7-10]. There is extensive
evidence that GBV-C is transmitted by sexual and percutaneous routes and is frequently found in populations at
risk for blood-borne or sexually transmitted viruses [5,11].
Male to male sex has been reported as an effective way of
transmission [12] and intrafamilial transmission has been
determined based on the sequences analysis [13,14]. GBVC has not been associated with any particular disease
despite numerous investigations. Alteration in the host’s
cellular immune response to HIV seems to be responsible
for a protective effect of GBV-C but the exact mechanism
to it still have to be defined. In contrast, GBV-C infection
does not appear to have any effect on chronic liver disease
due to HCV or HBV [12].
GBV-C infection is relatively common and has a worldwide distribution. At least 1 to 4% of healthy blood donors
have GBV-C RNA [1,5,7]. Most people clear the virus and
develop antibodies to the E2 envelope glycoprotein.
Furthermore, infection is common in the normal population with up to 12.9% prevalence among paid blood
donors in the United States of America [15], 11% to 14%
in West Africa or South Africa [8], and as high as 37%
among HIV-infected individuals [16]. GBV-C incidence
amongst of patients with HCV infection varies from 11 to
24% [17-19]. Further, little work has been done on coinfection of GBV-C and HBV but no significant effect of this
co-infection was reported [12].
The geographical distribution of GBV-C is related to the
coevolution of the viruses with human during the migration along the history, suggesting that GBV-C is an ancient
virus [20,21]. Genotype 1 is found in West Africa [22],
genotype 2 (sub-classified as both 2a and 2b) in the United
States and Europe [23], genotype 3 in Asia [24-26], genotype 4 in Myanmar and Vietnam [27], genotype 5 in South
Africa [28] and genotype 6 in Indonesia [29]. In South
America, the genotypes 1, 2a, 2b and 3 have been reported
[30-34]. In Colombia, a high prevalence of GBV-C RNA
and presence of genotype 3 were found among Colombian
native Indians from Wayuu, Kamsa and Inga ethic groups
[34].
The aim of this study was determined the frequency
of GBV-C RNA and the GBV-C genotypes circulating in
Colombia. This is the first study that characterizes the
presence of GBV-C among blood donors in coinfection
with HCV and HBV in Colombia.

Materials and methods
Study Population

In order to identified the frequency of GBV-C in
Colombia, i) 408 samples from Colombian blood donors

Page 2 of 7

positive for anti-HCV (n = 250) and positive for HBsAg
(n = 158) using third generation ELISA in the blood
bank of Cruz Roja Colombiana in Bogota city, Colombia, and ii) 99 samples from indigenous people with
HBV infection from Leticia, Amazonas were obtained
for this study. These samples were collected between
2003 and 2007 and the presence of HCV RNA and
HBV DNA were previously reported by our group
[35,36].
The protocol of this study was approved from Ethical
Committees from the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana,
Bogotá, Colombia and University of São Paulo Medical
School, São Paulo, Brazil. All patients have signed an
informed consent before joining the study.
GBV-C RNA Extraction

To avoid false-positive results, rigorous procedures used
for nucleic acid amplification diagnostic techniques were
followed [37]. HCV-RNA extraction was carried out
from 140 ml of serum using QIAamp Viral RNA Kit
(QIAGEN, Valencia, CA), following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The synthesis of the complementary DNA
(cDNA) was carried out immediately after RNA
extraction.
Synthesis of the complementary DNA (cDNA)

Reverse transcriptase reaction was performed using the
Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus Reverse Transcriptase
(MMLV-RT) and random primers. The final volume of
the reaction was 60 ml in the following concentrations:
50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2 ,
10 mM DTT, 0.5 mM of each dNTP, 450 ng random
primers, 30 U RNAse enzyme inhibitor (RNaseOUT™),
and 300 U MMLV-RT. Samples were submitted to the
following temperature cycles: 70°C for 10 min, 25°C
for 15 min, 37°C for 60 min, and 95°C for 15 min in a
thermocycler (Eppendorf Mastercycler 1, Eppendorf,
Hamburg, Germany).
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

A fragment of 344 bp from 5’ untranslated region
(5’UTR) was amplified by nested RT PCR [28,38].
Amplification consisted of 40 cycles for first and second
round of PCR, with the following incubation times and
temperatures: 94°C 30 s, 50°C 30 s and 72°C 30s for the
first round and 94°C 30s, 60°C 30 s and 72°C 30s for
the second round.
GBV-C Sequencing

Amplified cDNA was purified using the ChargeSwitch
PCR Clean-Up Kit. Sequencing was done in an ABI
Prism 3500 Automatic Sequencer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA) using dideoxy nucleoside triphosphates
(ddNTPs) containing fluorescent markers (Big Dye1

Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction KitApplied Biosystems).
The consensus sequences were obtained by alignment
of both sequenced strands (sense and antisense) using
the SEQUENCHER software (Gene Codes Corporation
Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America).
Phylogenetic Analysis

The sequences obtained in this work were genotyped by
phylogenetic reconstructions using reference sequences
from each GBV-C genotype obtained from GenBank
(n = 160). Sequences were aligned and edited using
Clustal X [39] and Se-AL (available at: http://tree.bio.ed.
ac.uk/software/seal/) softwares respectively. Bayesian
phylogenetic analyses were conducted using the Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation implemented
in BEAST v.1.5.3 [40]. The dataset was analyzed under
relaxed uncorrelated lognormal and relaxed uncorrelated
exponential molecular clock using the best model of
nucleotide substitution (GTR+G+I) chosen by MODELTEST [41] and 20 million generations were sufficient
to obtain the convergence of parameters. The molecular
clock that best fitted the data was chosen by Bayes factor (BF) comparison. The maximum clade credibility
(MCC) tree was obtained from summarizing the 20,000
substitution trees after excluding 10% of burn-in using
Tree Annotator v.1.5.3 [40]. Phylogenetic trees were
visualized in FigTree v.1.2.2 (available at: http://tree.bio.
ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).
Statistical analyses

Statistical analyses were performed using Minitab Software v. 15. The c2 test for linear trend (a = 0.05) was
used to examine the variations in the presence of GBVC RNA adjusted for age group, sex and co-infection
group (Anti-HCV or HBsAg).

Phylogenetic Analysis

Eighteen out of 23 sequences with good quality were
used for phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic tree
constructed with the GBV-C sequences (n = 160) is
shown in Figure 1. This analysis revealed the presence
of the following GBV-C genotypes among blood donors:
2a (41.6%), 1 (33.3%), 3 (16.6%) and 2b (8.3%). All genotype 1 sequences were found in co-infection with HBV

and 4/5 sequences genotype 2a were found in co-infection with HCV. All sequences from indigenous people
from Leticia were classified as genotype 3. The presence
of GBV-C infection among blood donors group and
indigenous people was not correlated with sex (p =
0.43), age (p = 0.38) or origin of the samples (p = 0.17).
The Colombian GBV-C sequences were deposited in the

Discussion
In this study, we determined the frequency and genotypic characteristics of GBV-C virus in Colombia. Among
Colombian blood donors, from 158 HBsAg positive
samples, eight (5.06%) were positive for GBV-C and
from 250 anti-HCV positive samples, eight (3.2%) were
positive for GBV-C. This is the first report showing the
frequency of GBV-C in HBV and HCV positive blood
donors in Colombia.
There are few studies that reported GBV-C frequency
in blood donors populations. In Salvador and in Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil it was reported 10% of frequency of GBVC among blood donors [42,43]. Also, in São Paulo, Brazil
it was reported a high prevalence among blood donors
with normal and elevated ALT levels: 5.2% (5/95) and
6.5% (5/76), respectively [14]. Furthermore, the prevalence of GBV-C was 9.7% among 545 blood donors in
São Paulo [44] and 8.3% in 1.039 healthy individuals [45].
In Iranian volunteer blood donors the prevalence of
GBV-C was around 1% [46]. A study of prevalence of
GBV-C among northeastern Thai blood donors carrying
HBsAg and anti-HCV revealed a higher frequency of
GBV-C RNA (10% and 11%, respectively) in the coinfected when compared with the controls [47]. In United
States, GBV-C prevalence in blood donors was reported
ranging from 0.8% to 12.9% [48,49]. In Turkey the prevalence of GBV-C was 14% in hemodialysis patients and 5%
in blood donors [50]. Also, in Thailand the GBV-C RNA
positivity among blood donors was 4.8% [51]. In France,
among 306 HCV RNA-positive donors, 19.3% were GBVC RNA positive [52]. In Egypt, El-Zayadi et al., [53] found
12.2% of GBV-C prevalence among blood donors and
GBV-C coinfection in HBV and HCV infected patients
were 7.6 and 64.9%, respectively. GBV-C infection is generally more common in groups with risk factors for percutaneous and sexual transmission of infectious agents
[54].
The presence of GBV-C infection in our study was not
correlated with sex (p = 0.43), age (p = 0.38) or origin
(p = 0.17). These results are correlated with the previous
study performed among three different Indian groups
from Colombia (Wayuu, Inga and Kamsa) where no significant differences were found [34].
A phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of GBVC genotypes 2a, 1, 3 and 2b among Colombian blood
donors. There are few studies that reported GBV-C genotypes among blood donor populations in the world. In
Bolivia, among blood donors, it was found that the major
genotype was genotype 3 followed by genotype 2 [32]. In
Shanghai, China, genotype 3 was the most prevalent [55].

Page 5 of 7

In Martinique, Césaire et al., [56], reported genotypes 2a,
1 and 2b among blood donors.
Furthermore, all genotype 1 sequences from Colombian blood donors were found in co-infection with HBV
and 4/5 sequences from blood donors genotype 2a were
found in co-infection with HCV, it was not found a significant association between the presence of HBV or
HCV co-infection and GBV-C genotype (p = 0.431).
These results are similar to other studies where no significant differences of HBV, HCV and GBV-C infection
rates were found [57].
Phylogenetic analysis showed that genotype 3 is the
most common in Leticia, Amazon region of Colombia.
The finding of an Asian GBV-C genotype in the Americas was first suggested by the analysis of 5’UTR hemophiliac patients from nine locations in Nicaragua [58],
Colombian Amerindians [34] and Bolivia [32]. Similarity
between Nicaraguan and Asian GBV-C genotype 3
strains indicates that these strains in the region presumably have an Amerindian origin [58].
In Colombia, from 163 native Indians, 6.1% (n = 10)
were positive for GBV-C RNA and it was concluded
that the incidence of GBV-C infection in native Indians
tended to be high compared with the general population
[34]. Furthermore, most Colombian native Indians harbored an Asian GBV-C genotype.
In an Amerindian population from Venezuela, a high
prevalence of GBV-C genotype 3 was observed, ranging
from 5% (9 out of 162) in the West to 25% (14 out of
56) in the south region of the country [33]. Whereas
GBV-C genotypes 1, 2 and 3 were presented in Venezuela, genotype 3 (Asian genotype) was found infecting
Amerindians and rural population [33].
Together with other studies, our results corroborate
the hypothesis that GBV-C is an old virus [21], having
been probably introduced in the America continent with
the fist men coming thought the Bering Strait
[32-34,58]. It is generally believed that Colombian native
Indians migrated from Asia to Colombia approximately
12,000 years ago and were isolated from other people
for religious reasons [59]. On the other hand, since
HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 may have been brought from Asia
to Colombia together with the first human migrants
[60], GBV-C/HGV apparently followed the same route
[34]. These results are correlated with the evolutionary
analysis of GBV-C performed by Suzuki et al., [61], that
assumed that this virus diverged 100.000 years ago.
However, further analysis needs to be performer to test
this hypothesis. Actually, more sequences of GBV-C
genotype 3 need to be reported with sampling date,
allowing to estimate a specific substitution rate for this
genotype that is needed for a more detailed phylogeographic analysis.

Conclusions
In conclusion, this is the first study that reported the
GBV-C frequency and the distribution of genotypes
among Colombian blood donors. The result presented
indicated the circulation of the genotype 3 among
Amerindian population in Colombia and blood donors.
