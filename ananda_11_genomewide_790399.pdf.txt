A genome-wide view of mutation rate
co-variation using multivariate analyses
Guruprasad Ananda1,2, Francesca Chiaromonte1,3*† and Kateryna D Makova1,4*†

Abstract
Background: While the abundance of available sequenced genomes has led to many studies of regional
heterogeneity in mutation rates, the co-variation among rates of different mutation types remains largely
unexplored, hindering a deeper understanding of mutagenesis and genome dynamics. Here, utilizing primate and
rodent genomic alignments, we apply two multivariate analysis techniques (principal components and canonical
correlations) to investigate the structure of rate co-variation for four mutation types and simultaneously explore the
associations with multiple genomic features at different genomic scales and phylogenetic distances.
Results: We observe a consistent, largely linear co-variation among rates of nucleotide substitutions, small
insertions and small deletions, with some non-linear associations detected among these rates on chromosome X
and near autosomal telomeres. This co-variation appears to be shaped by a common set of genomic features,
some previously investigated and some novel to this study (nuclear lamina binding sites, methylated non-CpG sites
and nucleosome-free regions). Strong non-linear relationships are also detected among genomic features near the
centromeres of large chromosomes. Microsatellite mutability co-varies with other mutation rates at finer scales, but
not at 1 Mb, and shows varying degrees of association with genomic features at different scales.
Conclusions: Our results allow us to speculate about the role of different molecular mechanisms, such as
replication, recombination, repair and local chromatin environment, in mutagenesis. The software tools developed
for our analyses are available through Galaxy, an open-source genomics portal, to facilitate the use of multivariate
techniques in future large-scale genomics studies.

Background
Deciphering the mechanisms of mutagenesis is central
to our understanding of evolution and critical for studies of human genetic diseases. The availability of a
multitude of sequenced genomes and their alignments
provides an opportunity to study mutations on a genome-wide scale in many species, including humans.
There is now substantial evidence for within-genome
variation in mutation rates; in particular, regional variation in nucleotide substitution rates, insertion and deletion (indel) rates, and microsatellite mutability have
been documented across the human genome [1-10].
However, notwithstanding the attention it has received
in the literature, the causative mechanisms underlying

regional mutation rate variation remain elusive. Biochemical processes, including replication and recombination, have been suggested as potential contributors to
mutation rate variation. For instance, replication likely
determines the differences in nucleotide substitution
rates among chromosomal types - nucleotide substitution rates are highest on chromosome Y, intermediate
on autosomes, and lowest on chromosome X (for example, [10,11]), consistent with the relative number of
germline cell divisions and thus DNA replication rounds
for each of these chromosome types [12,13]. Local male
recombination rate has been shown to be a significant
determinant of regional nucleotide substitution rate variation [10], supporting the potential mutagenic nature of
recombination and/or biased gene conversion [1,6,10].
Rates of small deletions have been found to be associated with replication-related genomic features, and
rates of small insertions with recombination-related features [8]. Finally, the role of replication slippage in

determining variation in mutability among microsatellite
loci has been recently corroborated [9]. Other factors for example, the predominance of aberrant DNA repair
mechanisms like non-homologous end-joining at subtelomeric regions [14], and yet unexplored mutagenic
mechanisms potentially acting at telomeres [10] - might
influence regional variation in mutation rates as well.
Genome-wide information on three additional genomic features has recently become available. Nuclear
lamina binding regions are thought to represent a
repressive chromatin environment and are concentrated
in the proximity of centromeres [15]; their impact on
local mutation rates has not been investigated to date.
An abundance of methylated sites at non-CpG DNA
locations in human embryonic stem cells was revealed
by a recent study [16], suggesting alternative roles for
DNA methylation in CpG and non-CpG contexts.
Although the function of methylation in generating
mutations at CpG locations has been extensively
researched [2,6,8-10], no study to date has looked at the
potential impact of the non-CpG methylome on the
genome and its mutagenesis; in particular, methylated
non-CpG cytosines may also elevate mutation rates.
Finally, recent predictions of the density of nucleosomefree regions based on MNase digestion [17] can be used
to understand the influence of local chromatin structure
on mutation rates. Assessing the contribution of these
three novel genomic features to mutation rate variation
is of obvious and immediate interest.
In addition to varying regionally, rates of different
mutations frequently co-vary with each other. Co-variation was observed between rates of nucleotide substitutions (estimated at ancestral repeats and four-fold
degenerate sites), large deletions and insertions of transposable elements [2]. In a separate study, co-variation
was observed between rates of nucleotide substitutions
and both small insertions and small deletions [8]. What
causes regional co-variation in the rates of different
mutation types? While explanations based on selection
have been considered [18], they are not satisfactory
because mutation rates also co-vary in presumably neutrally evolving portions of the genome [2]. Shared local
genomic landscapes might be responsible for the co-variation of these rates and, on a purely mechanistic basis,
one mutation type might be physically associated with
another one (for example, indel-induced nucleotide substitutions) [19], causing the corresponding rates to covary. However, these hypotheses have never been extensively explored. Notably, while a number of studies have
documented regional variation and co-variation of rates
of mutations of several types, they have mostly relied on
correlation and univariate regression analyses, which
relate mutation rates only in a pair-wise fashion, and
attempt to explain their variation (as a function of

Page 2 of 18

genomic features) one at a time [2,3,5,8-10,18,20-22]. A
better understanding of the structure and causes of
mutation rate co-variation, which is crucial for studies
of mutagenesis, can be achieved only through more
sophisticated data analysis approaches.
This is exactly what we pursued in the current study,
where we jointly investigated multiple mutation rates
alongside several plausible explanatory genomic features,
shedding light on the interplay between mutagenesis and
the genomic landscape in which it occurs. In more detail,
we used multivariate analysis techniques to characterize
the co-variation structure of four rates (nucleotide substitutions, insertions, deletions, and microsatellite repeat
number alterations) and explore their joint relationship
with several genomic landscape variables. First, we
applied principal component analysis (PCA) to mutation
rates computed along the genome. Next, we linked rates
to genomic landscape variables using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Finally, we applied non-linear versions of these multivariate techniques, kernel-PCA
(kPCA) and kernel-CCA (k-CCA), to investigate the presence of non-linear associations. We conducted our analyses on two mutually exclusive neutral subgenomes one repetitive (ancestral repeats (ARs)) and one unique
(non-coding non-repetitive (NCNR) sequences), and
three genomic scales (1-Mb, 0.5-Mb, and 0.1-Mb) using
human-orangutan comparisons, and repeated them for
two additional phylogenetic distances using humanmacaque and mouse-rat comparisons, to understand if
and how the structure of mutation rate co-variation and
the contribution of various genomic features may differ
among them.
Importantly, we have made the suite of software tools
implemented for this research publicly available, with
the aim of improving reproducibility and facilitating
future studies of mutation rates and other genome-wide
data. We integrated our software into a modular tool set
in Galaxy [23], a free and easy-to-use web-based genomics portal that has already established a substantial
community of users.

Results
To investigate co-variation in rates of nucleotide substitutions, small insertions, small deletions, and microsatellite repeat number alterations, we identified all such
mutations in the human-orangutan alignments, using
macaque as an outgroup to distinguish insertions from
deletions. Our rationale for using human-orangutan
comparisons is that, since their divergence is greater
than that of human and chimpanzee, it is expected to
be less affected by biases due to ancestral polymorphisms [24]. We limited our analysis to human-specific
mutations occurring after the human-orangutan split in
two supposedly neutrally evolving subgenomes; ARs [2]

and NCNR sequences [11]. These have been successfully
used for evaluating neutral variation in other studies
[2,8,10,11,25-27]. Human-specific mutations were chosen because of the high quality of the human genome
sequence and its annotation. The AR subgenome consisted of all transposable elements that were inserted in
the human genome prior to the human-macaque divergence (thus excluding L1PA1-A7, L1HS, and AluY). The
NCNR subgenome was constructed by excluding genes
and 5-kb flanking regions around them (thus removing
known coding and regulatory elements), other computationally predicted and/or experimentally validated functional elements (see Materials and methods), and all
repeats identified by RepeatMasker [28] (excluding
mononucleotide microsatellites). This minimizes potential effects of selection and avoids overlap with the AR
subgenome.
Next, the human genome was broken into 1-Mb
windows, which has been proposed as the natural variation scale for both mammalian nucleotide substitution and indel rates [8,25]. For each 1-Mb window,
restricting attention to the AR (and separately NCNR)
portion of the window, we computed rates of nucleotide substitutions, small (≤ 30-bp) insertions, small (≤
30-bp) deletions and mononucleotide microsatellite
repeat number alterations (Table 1; see Materials and
methods). Moreover, for each 1-Mb window we aggregated genomic features to be used as predictors (Table
2; see Materials and methods). Relationships among
mutation rates, and between mutation rates and genomic features, were explored using multivariate analysis
techniques, including PCA, CCA, and non-linear versions of both methods. All computations were performed using a suite of tools developed in Galaxy (see
Materials and methods).
To verify whether our findings were consistent over
different genomic scales and phylogenetic distances, we
produced and analyzed analogous data for the NCNR
subgenome considering 0.5-Mb and 0.1-Mb genomic
windows, as well as human-macaque alignments (here
insertions and deletions were distinguished using marmoset as the outgroup) and mouse-rat alignments (here
we studied mouse-specific mutations and distinguished
insertions and deletions using guinea pig as the

outgroup). Below, we focus on AR and NCNR subgenome results obtained with 1-Mb windows and humanorangutan alignments. Findings for, and comparisons
with, other genomic scales/phylogenetic distances analyzed for the NCNR subgenome are provided in the
next-to-last subsection of the Results, the Discussion,
and in Additional file 1.
Mutation rate co-variation

PCA was used to characterize co-variation among the
four mutation rates in terms of orthogonal components,
each representing a linear combination of the rates.
PCA was run on the correlation matrix (that is, after
standardizing the rates) and resulted in two significant
components (eigenvalues greater than 1) [29], which
accounted for approximately three-quarters of the total
variance (Table S1 in Additional file 1). Loadings (eigenvectors), which capture the correlation between each
principal component and the rates, were then used to
interpret the co-variation structure. Results were largely
similar between the AR and NCNR subgenomes (Figure
1).
The first principal component suggested that the
strongest co-variation in the genome occurs among
insertion, deletion and substitution rates. Insertion and
deletion rates exhibited large and concordant loadings
for this component in both subgenomes (Figure 1; Table
S2 in Additional file 1), indicating a strong positive association between these two mutation rates. Substitution
rate also had a large loading for the first principal component in both subgenomes, indicating its association
with indel rates.
Microsatellite mutability, which was absent from the
first principal component, was the only strong loading
in the second principal component in both subgenomes
(Figure 1; Table S2 in Additional file 1), suggesting that
the variation in this rate is largely orthogonal to the
others, and thus that the genomic forces driving microsatellite mutability might be distinct from those driving
indel and substitution rates (see below). Interestingly, a
marked negative correlation was observed between substitution rates and the number of orthologous microsatellites per 1-Mb window (Figure S1 in Additional file
1). Thus, microsatellite mutability and microsatellite

birth/death rates appear to have different dynamics in
the genome.
Non-linear relationship between certain mutation
types (for example, substitutions and insertions [8]) have
been observed by pair-wise comparisons in earlier

studies. Investigating non-linear associations (for example, one rate first increasing but then decreasing as
another increases; one rate exhibiting more than proportional growth as another increases; one rate ‘leveling off’
in its growth as another increases) is of interest because

they can be suggestive of connections and constraints
linking different mutation types. However, questions
concerning the strength of such non-linearities, especially when considered as a multiple (as opposed to
pair-wise) phenomenon, and whether they tend to occur
in particular genomic locations or contexts, have never
been addressed directly. To investigate the existence of
non-linear associations among multiple mutation rates,
we applied kPCA, a variant of PCA that utilizes kernel
mapping (see Materials and methods) to compute principal components in a high dimensional space non-linearly related to the original space [30]. While results
(Figures S2 and S3 in Additional file 1) were similar to
the PCA results described above (with the first principal
component dominated by insertion, deletion, and substitution rates, and the second dominated by microsatellite
mutability), the scores produced by linear PCA and
kPCA for 1-Mb windows, although associated, were not
in complete agreement (Figure S4 in Additional file 1).
Comparing linear and non-linear PCA scores provides a
means to identify genomic regions where neutral mutation rates are co-varying differently from the rest of the
genome. We regressed the strongest ‘non-linear signal’
(scores from the first kernel principal component) onto
the ‘linear signals’ that emerged as significant in the
data (scores from the first and second principal components; Table S3 in Additional file 1). The R2 value was
76%, implying that, for the most part, the non-linear signal could be recapitulated by the linear signals. The
windows where the non-linear signal was poorly recapitulated by the linear signals were identified as outliers of
the regression (see Materials and methods), and a vast
majority of them were found to be located either on
chromosome X (55% for AR, 64% for NCNR sequences)
or at subtelomeric regions of autosomes (Figure 2A;
58% and 45% of autosomal windows in AR and NCNR
sequences, respectively, were located within ≤15% of the
chromosomal length from the telomeres; see also Figures S5A and S6A in Additional file 1).
Mutation rate co-variation and genomic landscape

Linking mutation rates and their co-variation to the
genomic landscape is crucial for understanding its
effects on mutagenesis and thus drawing inferences on
potential causal mechanisms. To achieve this, we
employed CCA. This is a multivariate technique that,
given two sets of variables (for example, responses and
predictors), extracts pairs of components (each comprising a linear combination in the response space, and a
linear combination in the predictor space) that are
maximally correlated to one another - like PCA, subsequent pairs have orthogonal response components, and
orthogonal predictor components [31]. This provides a
way of simultaneously associating multiple mutation

Page 5 of 18

rates (responses, Table 1) to multiple genomic features
(predictors, Table 2).
We used the four mutation rates introduced above as
our response set, and formed a predictor set that
included genomic features shown to associate with
mutation rates in previous studies (GC content, recombination rates, number of CpG islands, proximity to telomere, replication timing, number of long interspersed
repetitive elements (LINEs), number of short interspersed repetitive element (SINEs), density of SNPs,
density of coding exons and density of conserved elements) [2,5,6,8-10], as well as features not formerly considered (number of nuclear lamina binding sites,
abundance of non-CG methyl-cytosines, and density of
nucleosome-free regions; Table 2). Some of these genomic features are correlated (for example, GC content
and replication timing [32,33]), and one can investigate
their co-variation structure through PCA as was done
for the mutation rates (PCA results for genomic features
are reported in Figure S7 and Tables S4 and S5 in Additional file 1). However, our focus here is not on identifying leading components of the local variation in
genomic landscape, but rather leading components of its
effects on mutation rates - to this end, extracting CCA
components is more effective and easier to interpret
than correlating principal components extracted separately for mutation rates and genomic features.
CCA yielded four canonical component pairs in the
NCNR subgenome and four in the AR subgenome. The
correlations observed for these pairs were 0.6955,
0.5043, 0.3906 and 0.1043 for the NCNR subgenome,
and 0.7338, 0.5336, 0.3287 and 0.0534 for the AR subgenome. Based on P-values from Rao’s F Approximation
test [34] (see Materials and methods), all four NCNR
pairs and the first three AR pairs were significant (Pvalues < 2.2e-16, < 2.2e-16, < 2.2e-16, and 0.0116 for
NCNR, and < 2e-16, < 2e-16, < 2e-16, and 0.7637 for
AR; Table S6 in Additional file 1). Remarkably, the first
three AR and NCNR response components described
very similar patterns (although differing in order; see
below). Loadings, which capture the correlations
between canonical components belonging to each pair
and the rates (in the response space) or the genomic
features (in the predictor space), were then used for
interpretation.
The first AR response component and the second
NCNR response component were very similar to one
another (and similar to the first principal component);
they showed strong and concordant loadings for insertion rates, deletion rates and substitution rates (Figure
3). Thus, these components render a direction of strong
co-variation for indel and substitution rates. The corresponding predictor components in both subgenomes
showed strong loadings for GC content, number of CpG

islands, non-CpG methylated sites, SINEs and density of
coding exons (all displaying a positive association with
the responses), as well as number of nuclear lamina
binding sites and density of nucleosome-free regions
(both negatively associated with the responses). Therefore, the first AR and second NCNR canonical component pairs suggest that nucleosome-free regions with
many nuclear lamina binding sites, low GC content,
fewer SINEs and fewer coding exons are less prone to
insertions, deletions and nucleotide substitutions (Figure
3). Male recombination rate (positively associated with
the responses), as well as distance from telomere and
density of conserved elements (both negatively associated with the responses) appear alongside all of the
above-mentioned genomic features as strong contributors to the second NCNR predictor component.
The second AR response component and the first
NCNR response component were similar to one another,

and both had dominant nucleotide substitution rate loadings (Figure 3). Thus, these components render a direction of strong nucleotide substitution rate variation. The
corresponding predictor components in both subgenomes had strong positive loadings for recombination
rates, and strong negative loadings for distance to telomere. The predictor component in the NCNR subgenome also had a strong positive loading for GC content.
The third AR and NCNR response components showed
strong loadings for deletion rates (Figure 3). In addition,
the NCNR component also displayed a strong loading for
insertion rates. Thus, these components render a direction of deletion rate variation in both subgenomes, additionally depicting a negative co-variation between indel
rates in the NCNR subgenome. In both subgenomes, the
corresponding predictor component had negative loadings for GC content, female recombination rate, SINE
counts, and density of conserved elements. Additionally,

NCNR CV−4

Figure 3 Helioplots for CCA performed on the AR and NCNR sub-genomes along the human-orangutan branch for 1-Mb windows. The
labels on the plots are as follows: CV, canonical variate; GC, GC content; CpG, number of CpG islands; nCGm, number of non-CpG methylcytosines; LINE, number of LINE elements; SINE, number of SINE elements; NLp, number of nuclear lamina associated regions; telo, distance to
the telomere; fRec and mRec, female and male recombination rates; SNPd, SNP density; RepT, replication time; nucFree, density of nucleosomefree regions; cExon, coverage by coding exons; mostCons, coverage by most conserved elements. Red bars indicate positive loadings, and blue
bars negative loadings. See Table S6 in Additional file 1 for summary statistics.

in the NCNR subgenome, the third predictor component
had sizeable positive loadings for density of nucleosomefree regions, and negative loadings for density of coding
exons.
Finally, although not significant in the AR subgenome,
the fourth response components in both the AR and
NCNR subgenomes had dominant microsatellite mutability loadings (Figure 3). Thus, these components render a direction of strong microsatellite mutation rate
variation. The marginal correlations between these and
the corresponding predictor components (0.104 and still
significant in NCNR, 0.053 and non-significant in AR),
and the smaller number of predictors with sizeable loadings, confirm a lesser role of genome landscape features
in explaining microsatellite mutability [9]. Nevertheless,
it is important to note a positive association between
microsatellite mutability and the density of CpG islands,
and a negative association between microsatellite mutability and counts of methylated non-CpG sites.
Non-linear relationships between mutation rates and
genomic landscape variables have been noted in previous
studies, and usually investigated through pair-wise

comparisons (for example, biphasic effect of GC content
on substitution rates [10]). Investigating non-linear associations between mutations and genomic context can
provide crucial insights into mutagenesis mechanism.
Here, we are interested in detecting and interpreting
non-linear signals linking multiple mutation rates to multiple genomic features, and on locating these signals
along the genome. We applied kCCA, a variant of CCA
that uses kernel mapping to compute canonical components in high dimensional spaces non-linearly related to
response and predictor spaces [35]. Plotting linear CCA
and kCCA scores against one another (Figure S8 in Additional file 1) suggested non-linearity in the association of
mutation rates to the genomic landscape, comprising a
small non-linearity in mutation rates, and a more noticeable one in genomic features. To further explore this, we
regressed the strongest ‘non-linear signals’ in response
and predictor space (scores from the first kernel CCA
response and predictor components) onto significant ‘linear signals’ (scores from significant linear CCA response
and predictor components; Table S7 in Additional file 1).
For the response space (mutation rates), the dominant

Ananda et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R27
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/3/R27

non-linear signal was almost entirely recapitulated by the
significant linear signals (R2 higher than 99% for both AR
and NCNR sequences). However, for the predictor space
(genomic features), significant linear signals could
account for merely 1% of the variance of the dominant
non-linear signal. Thus, when considering signals associating mutation rates and genomic landscape features,
non-linearities displayed by the latter are much stronger
than those displayed by the former.
We again used outliers from the regressions to identify genomic locations ‘driving’ non-linearity in mutation
rates and genomic features - that is, windows for which
non-linear signals were poorly recapitulated by linear
ones (see Materials and methods). In the case of the
responses, non-linearity was minimal (R 2 above 99%;
Table S7 in Additional file 1), but, interestingly, results
paralleled those obtained with PCA signals. The majority of outlying loci were on chromosome X (64% for AR
- Figure S5B in Additional file 1; 52% for NCNR
sequences - Figure S6B in Additional file 1) or near
autosomal telomeres (Figure 2B; 42% and 62% of autosomal windows in AR and NCNR sequences, respectively, were located within a distance ≤10% of the
chromosomal length from the telomeres; see also Figures S5B and S6B in Additional file 1). These are
regions of the genome where mutation rates are sizably
lower (chromosome X) or higher (telomeres) than autosomal averages. In the case of the genomic features, the
non-linearity was very marked (R2 of merely 1%; Table
S7 in Additional file 1), and a vast majority of the loci
driving this strong non-linearity were concentrated
around the centromeres of large chromosomes (Figure
2C; 49% and 51% of such windows in AR and NCNR
sequences, respectively, were within a distance of ≤15%
of the chromosomal length from the centromere; see
also Figures S5C and 6C in Additional file 1).
Consistency across genomic scales and phylogenetic
distances

To verify whether our findings could be reproduced
over different genomic scales and phylogenetic distances, in addition to the 1-Mb windows and humanorangutan comparison investigated above, we repeated
our analyses considering 0.5-Mb and 0.1-Mb genomic
windows as well as human-macaque and mouse-rat
comparisons. Interestingly, the mutation rate co-variation structure remained largely consistent across all
three genomic scales and all three phylogenetic distances (Figure 1; Figures S9 to S17 in Additional file
1). Nevertheless, we did observe some differences. For
instance, while microsatellite mutability varied orthogonally to indel and substitution rates at the 1-Mb
scale, a co-variation (at best moderate) linking microsatellite mutability to the three rates was shown by

Page 8 of 18

PCA at smaller scales (0.5 Mb and 0.1 Mb). CCA
results also captured this co-variation, with SINE
counts and GC content being the major contributors
(both negative; Figures S13 to S16 in Additional file 1).
Considering multiple window sizes also provided
insights into the scale at which various genomic features affect the structure of mutation rate co-variation.
For instance, replication timing, SNP density and density of nucleosome-free regions become significant predictors of microsatellite mutability at smaller scales
(Figures S13 to S17 in Additional file 1). These associations are noted here for the first time, as previous
studies only considered microsatellite mutability at
scales of 1 Mb or larger [9]. Further, the association of
mutation rates with genomic features showed some
differences between the rodent branch and the two
primate branches (Figure S17 in Additional file 1). For
instance, the effect of recombination on mutation rates
was found to be substantial in the primate comparisons, and barely marginal in the rodent comparison.
Such differences are expected given the fact that primates and rodents are known to differ in both genomic landscape characteristics and mutation rates [36].
Toolset in Galaxy

Comparative genomic studies like ours often process
enormous amounts of sequence and alignment data, the
storing and handling of which poses big challenges.
Having data and software tools on a single platform can
substantially facilitate genome-wide analyses and
improve reproducibility of results (see, for instance, a
workflow for the present study in Figure 4). To disseminate the software developed for our project to the
research community, we used Galaxy [23] - a free,
open-source genomics portal with a consistent and easyto-use interface capable of handling vast amounts of
data. Galaxy stores all sequences and alignments locally,
and provides a multitude of software tools organized in
different sections. The ones we developed (Table 3) are
available under the ‘Regional variation’, ‘Multiple regression’, and ‘Multivariate analysis’ sections, and include
software for alignment data preprocessing, identification
of mutations and computation of rates, aggregation of
genomic variables, and statistical analyses (more details
are provided in the Materials and methods).

Discussion
In this study we investigate regional co-variation among
mutation rates in largely neutrally evolving parts of the
human genome (the AR and NCNR subgenomes), and
its association with features of the genomic landscape.
For the first time, the structure and causes of mutation
rate co-variation were studied via a multivariate
approach considering several mutation types and a large

number of genomic features jointly. Notably, the similarity in results obtained for the AR and NCNR subgenomes lends support to the notion of a common
denominator shaping mutagenesis in both repetitive and
unique parts of the genome.
Association of insertion, deletion and substitution rates,
and its causes

As indicated by the first principal component of our
PCA analysis, the strongest co-variation in the genome

is among insertion, deletion, and substitution rates.
While this association has been suggested by previous
pair-wise analyses [8,37], here we are able to speculate
about its causes using the CCA results. The first AR
and second NCNR canonical component pairs (Figure
3) suggest that the co-variation of indel and substitution
rates is shaped by a common set of genomic features.
Some of these features have been found to affect rates
of individual mutation types in previous studies; in particular, GC content, number of CpG islands and SINEs,

and density of coding exons have been shown to associate positively with indel rate and substitution rate variation [2,5,8,10]. Other genomic features are investigated
here for the first time; we show that non-CpG methylcytosines, nuclear lamina binding sites and nucleosomefree regions are significant contributors to mutation rate
co-variation, suggesting a role for non-CpG methylation,
nuclear lamina association, and chromatin structure in
mutagenesis.
The positive effect of GC content, density of coding
exons and non-CpG methyl-cytosines on mutation rates
underlines the role of methylation in creating mutation
hotspots [38,39], while the negative effect of number of
nuclear lamina binding sites and density of nucleosomefree regions suggests that regions associated with the
lamina and/or having compact chromatin structures are
less prone to mutations. Distance from telomere appears
alongside all of the above mentioned genomic features
as a strong contributor to the second NCNR predictor
canonical component, with a negative association with
the responses, which emphasizes peculiar mutagenic
mechanisms acting near telomeres [6,8,10,40]. Notably,
the number of nuclear lamina binding sites is positively
associated with the distance to telomere in this component; in agreement with another study [15], this indicates that lamina binding regions might be less mutable
when they are located at a distance from the telomeres.
The first AR and second NCNR canonical component
pairs suggest that genomic regions with many nuclear
lamina binding sites, a high density of nucleosome-free
regions, low GC content, low exon density, and fewer
SINEs are less prone to insertions, deletions and nucleotide substitutions (Figure 3). Regions associated with
nuclear lamina constitute a strongly repressive chromatin environment [15], low-GC and gene-poor regions
are known to possess compact chromatin structure and
higher concentration of indels [41-43], and the preferential retention of SINEs in GC-rich regions has also been
linked to the chromatin structure (SINE integration may
be facilitated by chromatin decondensation in GC-rich
regions) [44]. Further, these component pairs show the
density of nucleosome-free regions to be positively associated with nuclear lamina counts, and negatively associated with both GC content, density of CpG islands
and coding exons. In all, the picture is one of nucleosome-free regions characterized by a compact chromatin
structure.
In summary, the first AR and second NCNR CCA
component pairs suggest that methylation and chromatin structure may have a dominant role in the strong
co-variation of indel rates and substitution rate - typifying an inverse relationship between compact chromatin
structure and proneness of DNA to indels and substitutions. This can perhaps be attributed to the low rate of

Page 10 of 18

lesion formation in compact chromatin regions [45] and
to the differences in repair mechanisms between different chromatin environments [46].
The third AR and NCNR CCA component pairs
depict deletion rate variation, with the third NCNR
CCA component pairs also indicating a negative association between insertion and deletion rates (Figure 3). The
corresponding predictor components have negative
loadings for GC content, SINE counts and density of
conserved elements (the latter only for the AR subgenome). GC-poor regions are known to be late-replicating [32,33] and more prone to replication errors [47],
which accounts for the elevated mutation rates; our
observation therefore supports a role of replication in
generating deletions. Furthermore, we confirm the negative association between SINE counts and deletion rates
observed previously [8,21]. The positive association of
GC content and density of coding exons with insertion
rates, and their negative association with deletion rates,
point to genomic regions that tolerate more insertions
than deletions; such regions were indeed found to be
present in GC-rich, gene-rich isochores in Venter’s genome by a recent study [43]. The negative association of
the density of conserved elements with deletion rates
reiterates a previous observation about conserved and
functional regions being depleted of small deletions [8].
A set of features comprising male and female recombination rates and distance to telomere was identified as
affecting substitution rates through the second AR and
the first NCNR CCA component pair (Figure 3). These
again reflect the role of recombination in contributing
to substitution rate variation [1,2,6,10,48], and reiterate
the presence of mutagenic mechanisms acting near telomeres that can lead to elevated nucleotide substitution
rates [10]. Alternatively, or additionally, telomeres might
possess fixation biases, for example, due to biased gene
conversion [49]. The strong positive loading for GC
content in the NCNR subgenome is a possible consequence of recombination-associated mismatch repair,
which is GC-biased in mammals [48,50,51].
Microsatellite mutability and its genomic determinants

Our results suggest that microsatellite mutability is driven by different factors than indel and substitution
rates. Indeed, microsatellite mutability was the only significant contributor to the second PCA component,
indicating a variation largely orthogonal to that of the
other three mutation rates. No association between
microsatellite mutability (computed here for mononucleotide microsatellites only) and substitution rate was
found also in another recent study [9]. The presence of
a negative correlation between microsatellite density and
substitution rates (Figure S1 in Additional file 1) confirms the findings of Zhu and colleagues [52], and

Ananda et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R27
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/3/R27

suggests differences in the dynamics and genomic landscape correlates of microsatellite mutability and microsatellite birth-death frequency.
The fourth AR and NCNR CCA component pairs,
which are dominated by microsatellite mutability on the
response side, are characterized by marginal correlations
and smaller numbers of genomic features with sizeable
loadings, suggesting an insubstantial role of the genomic
landscape in explaining microsatellite mutability. In
agreement with this, a recent study concluded that a
microsatellite’s intrinsic features (repeat number, length
and motif identity) are the primary determinants of its
mutability [9]. Nevertheless, it is important to note a
positive association between microsatellite mutability
and the density of CpG islands, and a negative association between microsatellite mutability and counts of
methylated non-CpG sites. Together, these observations
suggest that microsatellite mutability is suppressed in
methylated regions (CpG islands are usually unmethylated) [39].
Nonlinear trends in mutation rate co-variation and its
relationship with genomic predictors

A comparison of scores from PCA and kPCA indicates
some departure from linearity in the mutation rate co-variation structure. Non-linearities in the relationship
between insertion and deletion rates, as well as between
indel and substitution rates, have been noted earlier [8].
However, previous analyses were only pair-wise (that is,
did not consider several mutation types simultaneously)
and did not focus on identifying regions responsible for
non-linear signal. Here we show that genomic loci driving
non-linearities in mutation rate co-variation are concentrated on chromosome X and in proximity to the telomeres of autosomes, suggesting a role for the unique
landscape of chromosome X, as well as unexplored mutagenic mechanisms acting near telomeres. Indeed, loci with
the strongest departures from linearity tend to concentrate
in those parts of the genome where rates of nucleotide
substitutions, insertions and deletions are markedly higher
(telomeres) or lower (chromosome X) than the corresponding autosomal averages [4,6,8,10,23,40,53]. In comparison with autosomes, chromosome X is GC-poor
[54,55], late replicating [33] and has a biased distribution
of LINE and SINE transposable elements [26,56-58], while
autosomal subtelomeric regions are relatively GC-rich [6],
have higher recombination rates [6,59-61] and are
enriched for double-stranded breaks/repair [14,62]. Such
differences in genomic landscape features might indeed
substantially impact the structure of mutation rate covariation.
In contrast, a comparison of scores from CCA and
kCCA stressed departures from linearity on the predictor side (genomic features), with genomic loci driving

Page 11 of 18

non-linearities mostly concentrated around the centromeres of large autosomes. This suggests that chromosome size, unexplored mutagenic mechanisms acting
near centromeres, and other factors (for example, repair
differences between subtelomeric regions and other
parts of the genome) may be responsible for non-linear
signals associating mutation rates and genomic landscape features. Indeed, the non-linearities we detected
through kCCA, although much more marked for genomic features, may recapitulate non-linear trends
observed pair-wise in previous studies; for example,
non-linear relationships between nucleotide substitution
rates and GC content [2,6,10,63], indel rates and GC
content [8], substitution rates and distance to telomere
[10], and insertion rates and distance to telomere [8]. A
possible interpretation of the high concentration of
‘non-linearity driving’ loci around the centromeres of
large chromosomes is that non-linear signals might
manifest themselves only at a sufficient distance from
the telomeres (an average absolute distance of at least
60 Mb), with smaller chromosomes devoid of such loci
because this distance cannot be achieved. Other interpretations could involve differences between subtelomeric regions [14] and regions away from the telomeres
[62] relative to DNA repair.
In summary, we uncovered important information on
how a shared local genomic landscape shapes the covariation structure of mutation rates. The landscape surrounding centromeres of large autosomes comprises
strong non-linearities among genomic predictors as they
affect mutation rates - correspondingly, the latter are
linearly related and have moderate values. Subtelomeric
and chromosome X landscapes differ notably, with
genomic predictors behaving linearly as they affect
mutation rates, and the latter showing non-linearities
and extreme values (high and low, respectively). Interestingly, the landscape throughout small autosomes
appears similar to the subtelomeric landscape of larger
autosomes, suggesting that a region must be sufficiently
removed from telomeres in absolute terms before nonlinearities among genomic predictors can occur. We
note that a similar landscape (with genomic features
behaving linearly as they affect mutation rates) on small
autosomes might stem from the spatial proximity and
preferential interactions among these chromosomes [64].
Results at finer genomic scales

Results obtained repeating our analyses with 0.5-Mb and
0.1-Mb windows largely agreed with those described and
discussed for 1-Mb windows. In particular, the co-variation between indel and substitution rates was observed
and found to be dictated by a common set of genomic
features at all three scales (Figures 1 and 3; Figures S9
to S17 in Additional file 1). Similarly, substitution rate

Ananda et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R27
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/3/R27

variation was also observed at all three scales and found
to be driven by the same genomic landscape features.
However, some differences were observed with respect
to microsatellite mutability. Unlike at the 1-Mb scale, at
finer scales microsatellite mutability did show some covariation with indel and substitution rates. In addition,
genomic features appeared to have a stronger effect on
microsatellite mutability at finer scales. While at the 1Mb scale only CpG islands and methylated non-CpG
sites showed a (mild) association with microsatellite
mutability, at the 0.5-Mb and 0.1-Mb scales density of
nucleosome-free regions, density of SNPs and replication timing were also found to be significant predictors
(Figure 3; Figures S12 to S17 in Additional file 1). This
hints to a possible role of microsatellites in attracting
SNPs in their neighborhood (positive loading for SNP
density), likely facilitated by an interaction between heterozygous sites and mismatch repair process [65-67],
which is known to be less effective in late replicating
regions [68] (positive loading for replication timing).
These findings are evidence that genomic landscape
effects on microsatellite mutability cannot be completely
disregarded. When observed at larger scales (for example, 1-Mb and 5-Mb, as seen here and in [9]) microsatellite mutability appears mostly driven by their intrinsic
features. However, when focusing on finer scales (0.5
Mb and 0.1 Mb), genomic landscape features seem to
gain significant influence. It is important to remark that
these observations should be considered preliminary
because we only analyzed mononucleotide microsatellites; higher order microsatellites (di-, tri-, tetra-nucleotide microsatellites) are known to have very different
dynamics, and may show distinct associations with the
genomic landscape.
Results for the human-macaque and mouse-rat
comparisons

Both the structure of mutation rate co-variation and its
association with the genomic landscape appear similar
in human-orangutan and human-macaque comparisons
(Figures 1 and 3; Figures S9 to S16 in Additional file 1),
which span rather different evolutionary distances
(approximately 12 million years and approximately 25
million years, respectively). While other phylogenetic
distances should be considered in other studies, this
suggests that our results are not dictated by specific evolutionary distances.
The structure of mutation rate co-variation in the
mouse-rat comparison (approximately 12 to 24 million
years) was found to be very similar to that on the primate branches (Figures 1 and 3; Figures S9 to S17 in
Additional file 1). However, the association of mutation
rates with certain genomic landscape variables seemed
to differ - in particular, GC content, SNP density,

Page 12 of 18

recombination rates, and LINE and SINE counts (Figure
S17 in Additional file 1). This could be attributed to differences between the genomic landscapes of primates
and rodents; specifically, when compared to the human
genome, the mouse genome has higher mean GC content, more active L1 elements, lower overall levels of
recombination, and higher mutation rates [36,59].
Recombination rates, which appeared to significantly
influence indel and substitution rates in human-orangutan and human-macaque comparisons, showed barely
minimal influence in the mouse-rat comparison, consistent with previous observations that the role of recombination rate in rodent mutagenesis is at best moderate
[59,69].

Conclusions
The use of multivariate techniques was crucial to our
investigation of mutation rate co-variation and its relationship with the genomic landscape, as it allowed us to
consider several rates and several genomic features
simultaneously. The important insights we were able to
gather regarding mammalian mutagenesis could previously only be speculated about indirectly, if at all,
through pair-wise and univariate analyses. Moreover,
our in silico results provide useful hypotheses (for example, the decoupling of microsatellite and indel/substitution mutations and their contrasting relationship with
the underlying genomic landscape; the likely role of
non-CpG sites and nuclear lamina binding regions in
mutagenesis) that can be further evaluated in wet-lab
experiments (see, for instance, the hybrid computational/wet-lab approach we adopted in [70]).
In addition to an improved understanding of mutagenesis, our work has direct application to related areas
of genomic research, such as the prediction of functional
elements. Identification of functional elements in noncoding regions of the genome is contingent upon the
ability to clearly discriminate functional sites from neutrally evolving ones, which is complicated by regional
variation of neutral mutation rates. Previous studies
have indicated that conservation, or more generally
alignment-based scores, have increased performance in
the prediction of functional elements when corrected to
incorporate local substitution rates [10,71,72]. Future
studies could employ our results when designing local
background corrections in prediction algorithms. The
significant signals obtained from our principal component and canonical correlation analyses could be used as
composite correction variables, taking into account
simultaneously multiple mutation types and/or genome
landscape features. Notably, the results of our kernel
principal components and canonical correlation analyses
suggest that, while in some regions of the genome linear
composites of mutation rates and/or landscape features

Ananda et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R27
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/3/R27

will be satisfactory, non-linear composites may be much
more effective in others.
The statistical and computational tools developed for
our study have been integrated into Galaxy, a userfriendly genomics platform [23]. Our multivariate analysis tools are therefore available to the scientific community to reproduce our results, to investigate mutation
rate co-variation in other genomes, and to address a
plethora of other important biological questions on a
genome-wide scale.

Materials and methods
Data acquisition and pre-processing

Two types of presumably neutrally evolving subgenomes, the NCNR subgenome and the AR subgenome,
were constructed based on the March 2006 build of the
human genome (hg18). The NCNR subgenome was
constructed by excluding known genes (and the 5-kb
flanking regions surrounding them) as annotated at the
UCSC Genome Browser [73-75] and known functional
elements, including experimentally validated ones
(CTCF binding sites, estrogen receptor binding sites,
RNA polymerase II binding sites), and computationally
predicted ones (most conserved elements produced by
phastCons, vista enhancers, predicted CTCF binding
sites, and regions with ESPERR (evolutionary and
sequence pattern extraction through reduced representations) regulatory potential scores above 0.05), all as
annotated in the UCSC Genome Browser [73,75], to
remove the coding and regulatory parts of the genome,
and to eliminate additional sequences evolving under
functional constraints from the NCNR subgenome.
Furthermore, all repeats identified by RepeatMasker
[28], expect for mononucleotide microsatellites, were
removed from the NCNR subgenome to exclude overlap
with the AR subgenome. The AR subgenome consisted
of all transposable elements that were inserted in the
human genome before human-macaque divergence
(excluding L1PA1-A7, L1HS, and AluY). The human
genome was divided into 1-Mb windows, and coverage
for both subgenomes was computed in each of the windows. Windows having less than 25% coverage of either
NCNR sequences or ARs were discarded. Similarly, to
perform analyses at finer scales, the human genome was
divided into 0.5-Mb and 0.1-Mb windows and windows
with less than 25% coverage of either NCNR sequences
or ARs were discarded.
Alignments corresponding to the two subgenomes
were fetched and pre-processed using tools from Galaxy
(see Toolset section). Human-orangutan pair-wise alignments were fetched and processed for substitution rate
and microsatellite mutability computations, after being
filtered for quality using orangutan PHRED scores (with
a minimum quality threshold of 20) and for synteny

Page 13 of 18

(only those alignments blocks that contained orangutan
chromosomes syntenic to the human chromosomes
were considered). Similarly, human-orangutan-macaque
alignments were fetched and prepared for insertion and
deletion rate computations. The proportion of the two
subgenomes covered by these alignments is summarized
in Table S8 in Additional file 1.
Estimating mutation rates

Indels that occurred in the human lineage since its
divergence from the orangutan lineage were obtained
from the human-orangutan-macaque alignments, and
insertions were distinguished from deletions using
macaque as an outgroup (see detailed methods in [8]).
Indels that overlapped with microsatellites were discarded to avoid scoring the same events twice. The
insertion rate for each 1-Mb window was computed as
the ratio of the number of insertions in all indel-containing quality filtered NCNR (or AR) alignment blocks
in that window to the total number of nucleotides in all
alignment blocks present in that window. Similarly, the
deletion rate was computed as the ratio of the number
of deletions to the total number of nucleotides. Nucleotide substitutions were identified from the NCNR (or
AR) human-orangutan alignments using the Jukes’ and
Cantor’s (JC69) model (see detailed methods in [10]).
The nucleotide substitution rate for each window was
then computed as the ratio of the total number of such
substitutions in the window to the total number of
nucleotides in the alignment blocks falling in the window. Orthologous human-orangutan mononucleotide
microsatellites were identified using a modified version
of Sputnik [76] that allows detection of mononucleotide
microsatellites having at least nine repeats (based on
microsatellite thresholds determined by previous studies
[70,77]), separated from each other by at least 10 bp,
and having the same repeat motif at orthologous locations in both species. They were then grouped into
repeat number bins of size 4 (for example, 9 to 12, 13
to 16, and so on), and the mutability of each group was
computed following the methods described in [78]. Following Kelkar et al. [9], only groups with 30 or more
microsatellites were considered to ensure accuracy in
the estimation of mutability. To eliminate the effect of
repeat number on mutability, the mutability values were
regressed on average repeat number of the bins and the
residuals obtained were considered for further analysis.
Only mononucleotide microsatellites were considered,
since sufficient numbers of other microsatellites (repeats
of di-, tri-, or tetranucleotide motifs) could not be
obtained in windows of 1-Mb or smaller. Any mutation
occurring in overlapping alignment blocks was discarded
to avoid counting the same locus more than once, which
would otherwise lead to an inflation of mutation rates.

The workflow for estimating mutation rates is depicted
in Figure 4.
For human-macaque comparisons, indel rates were
computed from human-macaque-marmoset alignments
preprocessed as described above, with marmoset as the
outgroup, and substitution rates and microsatellite mutability were computed from pre-processed human-macaque pairwise alignments.

At 0.5-Mb and 0.1-Mb scales, all features except
recombination rate were computed as described above.
Recombination rates computationally predicted from
human genetic variation data [82] were used for 0.5-Mb
and 0.1-Mb windows, as sex-specific rates are not available at these scales.

Aggregating genomic landscape features

The resulting datasets consisting of aggregated genomic
variables and mutation rates computed for the AR and
NCNR subgenomes, separately, were each tested for
conformity to multivariate normality, and subjected to
multivariate outlier detection. As with simpler tools,
multivariate techniques can be used in a purely descriptive manner. However, when tests of significance are
required, and more generally if the data depart dramatically from multivariate normality, results may be misleading and difficult to interpret [31]. Our dataset was
tested for conformity to multivariate normality based on
a quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot of ordered squaredrobust Mahalanobis distances of the observations against
the quantiles of a chi-squared distribution with degrees
of freedom equal to the number of variables in the dataset. Mahalanobis distances give a measure of the distance of a particular observation from the mean vector
of the sample, and take into account the covariance
matrix - thereby quantifying both the shape and size of
multivariate data [83]. If the observations follow multivariate normality, then these distances are known to
have a chi-squared distribution with q degrees of freedom (where q is the number of variables in the dataset)
[31]. The Q-Q plot for our dataset did not depart substantially from a straight line through the origin (data
not shown), indicating conformity to multivariate
normality.
Outliers may also substantially affect the results of
multivariate techniques. We identified outliers as observations having large squared Mahalanobis distances
based on a 90% quantile of the chi-squared distribution
using the ‘mvoutlier’ package in R [84]. After removing
outliers, we retained a total of 2,027 windows in ARs,
and 1,953 windows in NCNR sequences, which were
considered for all subsequent analyses.
Normality tests and outlier filtering were performed
on windows at all genomic scales and all phylogenetic
branches and the resulting statistics are summarized in
Table S9 in Additional file 1.

Genomic features such as GC content, number of CpG
islands, male and female recombination rates, distance
to telomere, number of LINEs, number of SINEs, SNP
density and number of nuclear lamina binding sites
were obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser per 1Mb window of the human genome, based on hg18
annotations of the human genome in the UCSC Genome Browser. GC content was obtained from the
gc5base program available from the UCSC Genome
Browser, which computed the percentage of G and C
nucleotides in 1-Mb windows. CpG islands were
obtained from the cpgIslandExt table [79], and their
counts were apportioned into 1-Mb windows using
Galaxy tools. Male and female recombination rates in 1Mb windows were obtained from the deCODE map
rates [60] from the recombRate table. The coordinates
of LINE and SINE elements were obtained from the
RepeatMasker track and their respective counts in each
1-Mb window were computed using Galaxy tools. SNPs
were obtained from the SNP129 track [80]. Nuclear
lamina-associated sites were obtained from the ‘NKI
LaminB1’ track [15] and were apportioned into 1-Mb
windows after filtering out non-positive intensities and
therefore retaining only those domains that are strongly
bound to the lamina. Replication timing was calculated
as the time spent by a sequence in the S phase of the
cell [33]. Genomic coordinates of non-CpG methyl-cytosines were obtained from the datasets produced by Lister and colleagues [16]. Since the majority of the
chromosomes between human and orangutan genomes
have little or no chromosomal rearrangements [81], only
the human telomere coordinates were considered to calculate distances to telomere. Telomere coordinates were
obtained from the Gap track, and the distance from the
middle of each window to its closest telomere was computed. Nucleosome-free regions predicted from MNase
cleavage [17] were obtained, and their density in 1-Mb
windows was computed using Galaxy tools. Coordinates
of coding exons were obtained from the UCSC Genes
track, and their coverage per window was computed
using Galaxy tools. Similarly, we obtained coordinates of
most conserved regions from the ‘28-way most conserved’ track, removed coding exons from this list and
obtained coverage per window using Galaxy tools.

Multivariate analysis
Normality and outliers

Principal component analysis

PCA [31,34] extracts linear combinations of maximal variance in a given space of variables. The first principal
component represents the linear combination whose variance in the data cloud is greatest amongst all possible
linear combinations. The second principal component is

Ananda et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R27
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/3/R27

constructed to be orthogonal to the first principal component, and to account for maximal variance after it, and
so on. We performed PCA in the four-dimensional space
of mutation rates using the princomp function from the
R statistical package [85]. The principal components
were extracted based on the correlation matrix (not the
covariance matrix), and were therefore unaffected by
units of measurement, scale and location of the different
mutation rates. Of the four principal components, only
the first two had eigenvalues (variances) ≥ 1 (the average
eigenvalue of a correlation matrix), and they accounted
for nearly 75% of the total variance. Therefore, following
Kaiser’s rule [29], we decided to consider only the first
two principal components. The eigenvectors (loadings),
which capture the correlations between principal components and original variables, were used to interpret the
results of PCA.
Kernel principal component analysis

Gaussian kPCA [30] was performed using the R package
‘kernlab’ [86]. kPCA is a non-linear version of PCA,
which employs a kernel function (K(x,x’) = exp(-s ||x x’||2) in the Gaussian case) to calculate the inner products between data points in a high dimensional space F
representing non-linearity, without actually performing
the mapping to this space (this reduces computational
burden). PCA is thus performed on F. The kernel function shown above is a general-purpose Gaussian radial
basis function, which is normally used when no prior
knowledge is available about the structure of the data.
To determine if the signals obtained from kernel PCA
are comparable with those from linear PCA, we
obtained the scores of the observations (genomic windows) on the strongest kernel principal component and
regressed them against the scores of the observations on
the significant linear principal components. This allowed
us to quantify how well the kernel scores of our genomic windows were recapitulated by their linear scores,
that is, how comparable non-linear and linear signals
were in the windows.
Canonical correlation analysis

CCA [31,34] extracts linearly correlated features from
two sets of variables, both multidimensional in nature
(that is, several Xs versus several Ys). It involves identifying pairs of maximally correlated canonical variates
(CVs; ui,vi), where ui is a linear combination of the Xs,
and vi a linear combination of the Ys. The first CV pair
(u1,v1) has highest correlation R1 among all possible linear combinations of Xs and Ys. Similarly, the second
CV pair (u 2 ,v2 ) has the second largest correlation R 2 ,
with the constraint that u2 is orthogonal to u1, and v2 to
v1, and so on. In all, s pairs (u1,v1), (u2,v2),...,(us,vs) are
extracted, such that R1 > R 2 > ... > Rs , where s is the
smallest between the number of Xs and number of Ys.

Page 15 of 18

We performed CCA with the aid of functions from
the R package ‘yacca’ [87]. Four CVs were obtained, the
statistical significance of which was assessed using an F
test for canonical correlations, with Rao’s approximation
[34]. Loadings, which represent the correlations between
the original variables and the respective CVs, were used
to interpret the CVs in terms of the original X and Y
variables.
Kernel canonical correlation analysis

kCCA [35] is a non-linear version of CCA, which uses a
kernel function to provide maximally correlated non-linear features from the two sets of variables. We implemented it with the R ‘kernlab’ package employing again
a Gaussian radial basis function as kernel.
For the strongest kernel canonical component, we
used standardized predictor (or response) variable coefficients for each observation as an indicator of how
strongly the observation is scored by the kernel component. These scores were then regressed against standardized predictor (or response) variable scores obtained
from significant linear components to understand the
extent to which non-linear and linear signals were
compatible.
Comparison of linear and non-linear PCA (or CCA) scores

We regressed the ‘strongest’ non-linear signal (scores
from kPCA or kCCA) onto significant linear signals
(scores from PCA or CCA) to identify the extent to
which the non-linear signal was being captured by the
linear signals. Windows for which the standardized
absolute residuals were greater than 2 were considered
as drivers of non-linearity, that is, locations at which the
non-linear signal was poorly recapitulated by the linear
ones.
Toolset in Galaxy

The following software tools are made available under
the ‘Regional variation’, ‘Multiple regression’, and ‘Multivariate analysis’ tool sections of Galaxy.
Alignment data preprocessing

These are general-purpose tools, which can be used to
process multiple genomic alignments of any species.
We contributed tools to filter multiple alignments
based on PHRED quality scores available for each
sequenced genome at the UCSC Genome Browser
[73,75], and to mask CpG or non-CpG sites in multiple alignments. For the first, quality scores for several
species are locally cached in Galaxy, and the user is
provided with options to select which species to mask,
what quality cutoffs to use, how many positions surrounding low-quality bases to mask, and so on. For the
second, the user can select an inclusive or restrictive
definition of CpG sites [11], as well as the species on
which to base the masking.

Computation of mutation rates

These tools allow the computation of nucleotide substitutions and microsatellite mutability from pair-wise alignments, and the computation of rates of insertions and
deletions from three-way alignments. The mutations identified by these tools can be aggregated in genomic windows, and mutation rates per window can be calculated.
Aggregation of genomic features

Galaxy provides a direct connection to the UCSC Genome Browser [73,75], which houses genomic sequences
and annotation data for numerous genomes. Genomic
features retrieved into Galaxy from the UCSC table
browser can be aggregated in windows of user-defined
size by using the ‘Make windows’ and ‘Feature coverage’
tools in the ‘Regional variation’ section.
Statistical analyses

Tools for performing multiple regression, best subsets
selection, and to compute RCVE (relative contribution
to variability explained, a measure of the role of each
predictor in explaining the total variability of a
response) [8], are available in the ‘Multiple regression’
section. Besides providing summary regression output,
these tools produce a number of diagnostic plots. Tools
for performing linear and kernel PCA and CCA are
available in the ‘Multivariate analysis’ section. These
tools give the user several convenient options (for example, which variables to include, whether to scale the
variables, what type of kernel to use) and produce summary output and graphics.
