Abstract
As a result of the integration of molecular and morphological approaches for the reconstruction of
phylogenies, and of the intertwining of developmental and evolutionary biology, further prospects
are open for a fruitful interaction between these two fields in what we may call a phylo-evo-devo
approach.
Wiegmann et al.'s molecular phylogeny of the holometabolous insect orders, recently published in
BMC Biology, offers a good opportunity to revisit the inverted positions of wings and halteres in
the Diptera and the Strepsiptera in terms of a putative homeotic mutation in the Hox gene
Ultrabithorax. The main finding of this paper is that Strepsiptera are closely related to the
Coleoptera rather than Diptera, as recently claimed. Through this exemplary case, the paper
demonstrates the value of the reciprocal illumination we can expect from the integration of a good
phylogeny and a sound knowledge of the evolvability of developmental mechanisms.

Commentary
Evolutionary developmental biology, or evo-devo, has
benefited from an integrated use of tools, both conceptual
and experimental, that were originally developed within a
number of separate fieldsand the discipline'smultiple
roots are fixed inits name. Another discipline to benefit is
phylogenetics, within which the morphological and the
molecular approach are far from being quietly integrated,
but are nevertheless in daily, eventually constructive confrontation. Needless to say, an integration of evo-devo
with phylogenetics, an approach we may call phylo-evodevo, will benefit both traditions alike, the phylogenetic
and the evolutionary developmental one [1]. What matters, however, is to take the new challenge seriously. If
evo-devoists have been too often naïf in reconstructing
ancestral states without resorting to cladistics, phylogeneticists have been equally naïf in using vague notions of
comparative developmental genetics to speculate too

freely about the possible origin, or course, of major morphological changes in evolution.
Evo-devo was called in as a possible source of explanation
of the counterintuitive morphological relationships
between two insect orders, the Diptera and the Strepsiptera, whose close phylogenetic affinities were suggested
by mitochondrial DNA sequences [2-7]. In male Strepsiptera (females are wingless) the forewings are reduced to
small rigid structures somehow comparable to the modified hindwings (the halteres) of the Diptera, while their
hindwings are membranous (as are the hindwings of the
Diptera). Morphologists had never suggested dipteran
affinities for the Strepsiptera, the most popular phylogenetic hypothesis favouring instead affinities to the Coleoptera, with the Hymenoptera being sometimes offered as
an alternative. Now, under the new hypothesis of sistergroup relationships between the Diptera and the StrepPage 1 of 3

siptera, the rough similarity between the dipteran halteres
and the reduced forewings of the Strepsiptera was deemed
worthy of investigation. The comparison, however, stood
against a great difficulty: the lack of positional equivalence between the two structures. Thus, knowing that in
the fruitfly the identity of the dorsal appendages of the
meso- and metathorax is under the control of the Hox
genes, it was suggested that the inverted position of membranous wings and halteres between the two insect orders
could be the result of a point mutation of one of these
genes (tentatively, Ultrabithorax) in a common ancestor
with dipteran-like organization [2]. This hypothesis, however, disregarded the fact that all known mutations in Hox
genes eventually resulting in the positional shift of a given
pair of appendages are either a gain-of-function or a lossof-function mutation, respectively producing, at a given
position along the main body axis, a feature originally
expressed at a more anterior or posterior location. No
mutation, however, is known to cause a reciprocal
exchange of position between two features, as required by
the 'homeotic wing/haltere exchange' hypothesis. The
problem thus remained unresolved, as further phylogenetic analyses based on mitochondrial gene sequences
seemed to confirm the dipteran affinities of the Strepsiptera.
The problem was clearly in need of further study. At last,
this has been done in a newly published analysis of the
phylogenetic interrelationships among all the orders of
holometabolous insects [8]. This study, based on a reasonably rich sample of nuclear gene sequences, rejects the
putative affinities of the Strepsiptera with the Diptera and
restores ample credibility to the old hypothesis of closest
affinities between the Strepsiptera and the Coleoptera.
Thus, if any morphological comparison is eventually
worth investigation among the dorsal thoracic appendages of these insects, the scenario must now involve the
'halteres' of male Strepsiptera and the elytra of the Coleoptera – obvious positional homologues, as they all
belong to the second thoracic segment.
Morphological evidence is probably insufficient to reconstruct phylogeny whenever structures are extensively
reduced [9], as in the case of the forewings of the Strepsiptera, or the halteres of the Diptera. In these cases, to rely
more on molecular than morphological evidence is an
obvious choice, but this does not mean that morphology
cannot be informative. This is particularly true of those
instances where evolutionary developmental biology is
able to throw light on changes in morphology. Vertebrates
with reduced limbs are a case in point, as the order with
which the digits are lost, in the species with less than five,
turns out to be clade-specific and to strictly correspond, in
inverted order, to the sequence with which the five digits
are built in those related species that have all of them [10].

As a consequence, the simple inspection of the hand or
the foot is sometimes of value in assessing the affinities of
animals with two, three or four digits, and this is obviously relevant when we deal with fossils.
There are instances where phylogeny helps to restrict the
choice among alternative hypotheses of developmental
mechanisms responsible for producing a given structural
trait. This is the case of arthropod segmentation. Two
competing scenarios have been proposed, one of them
implying that segmental units are produced serially by the
activity of a posterior, subterminal growth zone. The other
scenario suggesting instead that an initial establishment
of a small number of primary segmental units along the
anterior-posterior body axis is followed by the regular
splitting of these units into secondary segments, through
one or more runs of duplication. Of recent, a scolopender
species has been described, with leg-bearing segments
numbering either 39 or 43 within the same population,
thus dramatically differing from all the remaining 700
species in that group, which have either 21 or 23 pairs of
legs. Interestingly, a cladistic analysis has shown that this
centipede does not represent an isolated lineage, but has
recently split off from within a genus where the more popular leg-pair numbers 21 and 23 can coexist in the same
species. The total lack of intermediates and the roughly
2:1 ratio in segment number between the new species and
its relatives seems to be a good argument in favour of the
double-segmentation model [11].
We now have more and more robust phylogenies and
deeper insights into evolutionary variations of developmental mechanisms, but the challenge is to understand
the data in an integrated phylo-evo-devo framework. Further levels of integration are waiting around the corner.
For example, evo-devo has being largely growing on the
recent spectacular results of comparative developmental
genetics, but this still requires a good injection of population genetics [12]. A few pilot studies in this direction
[13,14] have amply demonstrated how much this helps
the understanding of evolvability, arguably one of the
most exclusive topics of evo-devo research [15].
