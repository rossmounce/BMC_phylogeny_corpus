A proteomics approach to decipher the
molecular nature of planarian stem cells
Enrique Fernández-Taboada†, Gustavo Rodríguez-Esteban†, Emili Saló*, Josep F Abril*

Abstract
Background: In recent years, planaria have emerged as an important model system for research into stem cells
and regeneration. Attention is focused on their unique stem cells, the neoblasts, which can differentiate into any
cell type present in the adult organism. Sequencing of the Schmidtea mediterranea genome and some expressed
sequence tag projects have generated extensive data on the genetic profile of these cells. However, little
information is available on their protein dynamics.
Results: We developed a proteomic strategy to identify neoblast-specific proteins. Here we describe the method
and discuss the results in comparison to the genomic high-throughput analyses carried out in planaria and to
proteomic studies using other stem cell systems. We also show functional data for some of the candidate genes
selected in our proteomic approach.
Conclusions: We have developed an accurate and reliable mass-spectra-based proteomics approach to
complement previous genomic studies and to further achieve a more accurate understanding and description of
the molecular and cellular processes related to the neoblasts.

Background
As we move further into the post-genomic era it
becomes increasingly clear that DNA sequence data
alone is insufficient to explain complex cellular
and molecular processes. Although the enormous
volume of data generated by genome sequencing projects, expressed sequence tags (ESTs), and cDNA analyses has improved our understanding of many
processes, they often fail to reflect the influence of posttranscriptional modifications and protein interactions or
offer a true reflection of protein levels or activity. Consequently, the role of specific proteins is relatively difficult to determine with confidence on the basis of
mRNA expression or genomic data alone [1,2].
Proteomic approaches offer a more realistic description of protein function and its influence on cell
dynamics. Although comparative analysis of phenotypically different biological samples, such as in diseased
versus healthy tissue [3], remains a challenge, those studies raise the possibility of identifying the protein

“signatures” that underlie key biological phenomena [4].
Furthermore, the use of bioinformatics to integrate data
obtained using genomic and proteomic techniques could
help to bypass the limitations of each approach and
achieve a more comprehensive view of the information
flow within cells.
Planarians, an emerging model system for the investigation of stem cell and regenerative biology, [5-7], have a
unique population of stem cells called neoblasts (see
Figure 1), which can give rise to all of the differentiated
cell types present in the adult organism during regeneration or normal homeostasis [8,9]. Albeit a great deal is
now known about the biology of these cells, most molecular data have come from cDNA and genomic analyses.
The neoblasts are particularly suited to proteomic
approaches, however, as they contain chromatoid bodies
(CB) that are progressively lost during differentiation
[10-12] and can be employed as a marker for undifferentiated cells. The CB complexes are mainly formed by proteins and latent mRNA molecules, which can distort the
levels of gene expression in transcriptional analyses of
neoblasts samples. Moreover, since the neoblasts are the
only dividing cells in the planaria [5], they can be easily
depleted by irradiation [13]. Thus, these unique

blastema and some mitotic cells still remain 3 days after irradiation, no divisions are detected after 14 days, showing that neoblasts are
completely eliminated at that time. D, Electron microscopy image of a neoblast cell. Cytoplasm (dim yellow) and nucleus (yellow) are

characteristics make planarians an ideal system in which
to explore the use of proteomics to analyze the biology of
processes such cell differentiation, stem cell behavior,
homeostasis and an array of other events. As a first step
in the development of such an approach, here we
describe the methodological establishment and validation
of a proteomic analysis of the planarian neoblast.

Results
Establishment of the planarian proteomic approach

Different methods were tested to achieve a consistent
and reproducible pattern on two-dimensional (2D) gels.
To optimize sample preparation, proteins were extracted
from dissociated cells or from whole animals. The yield
from dissociated cells was insufficient to establish an
efficient 2D procedure. Furthermore, the reproducibility
of the 2D gel pattern was poor (data not shown). Prior
to extraction from whole animals, a short treatment
with 2% cysteine chloride in planarian water was used
to eliminate mucous production, which is known to
interfere with molecular techniques [14]. Based on our
tests and previous work by Collet and Baguñà [15], we
established a consistent method for 2D analysis from
planarian samples (Figure 2 and Additional File 1). The
different lysis buffers and sample cleaning procedures
tested are shown in Table 1. Between 50 and 1000 μg of
total planarian proteins were loaded on 2D gels to
establish the best sample quantity in terms of spot definition. From 100 to 500 μg the spot resolution was
acceptable. We selected the 500 μg as the optimal
amount of protein to load onto 2D gels to achieve the
maximum number of spots. A minimum of 100 μg was
necessary for spot detection. Different immobilized pH

gradient strips were used and the second-dimension
protocol was modified to avoid streaking problems
(Table 1). All these variables were tested on 12-cm 2D
gels and scaled up to 24-cm gels for subsequent
procedures.
Proteomic data

In order to identify proteins specifically expressed in neoblasts, we compared 2D patterns of two samples: wild type
(WT) versus irradiated animals (IA). This method has been
extensively used to study the effects of neoblast depletion
[8,13]. Extractions were done 14 days after irradiation,
when animals remained viable but cell proliferation was
absent (Figure 1). Once the protocol was set up and the
spot patterns were reproducible (Figure 2 and Additional
File 2), the spots were compared and selected. Although
spot labelling by silver staining and DIGE was consistent in
each case, we did not succeed in obtaining a uniform pattern with the two techniques. Follow-up analysis was therefore done separately. With the aim of establishing the real
potential of the silver-staining technique, only clear and
conserved qualitative comparison based on silver staining
was considered (present in WT sample and not present in
irradiated sample). Image master 2D™software (from
Amersham Biosciences) was used to analyze the scanned
gels. However, the potential bottleneck of this proteomic
approach is the image analysis. Many authors have highlighted the difficulties in obtaining good replicates [16], and
this has now been partially overcome with the use of DIGE.
Whereas our silver-staining results showed remarkable pattern conservation within replicates (Additional File 2), the
numbers after spot image analysis showed some variability.
In order to improve signal specificity we used two types of

sample protein. The differences between irradiated and
non-irradiated samples that were conserved in both sample
loads and also had three surrounding reference spots in
both experimental conditions were selected after reviewing
the correspondence in Ip and Mw (Figure 2). These

restrictions reduced the number of selected spots substantially, but ensured a high degree of confidence in the differences selected, providing a better platform for validation of
the technique. For DIGE staining, the standard protocol
was followed without modifications and the analysis software was used with the default parameters. Only clear and
conserved quantitative changes (>2-fold changes) were
selected, drastically reducing the number of final candidate
spots (Figure 2). A total of 26 and 58 spots were selected
for silver and DIGE staining, respectively (Table 2).

[18,19], Schmidtea mediterranea ESTs [20], the contigs
for the planarian genome WUSTL assembly version 3.1
[21], and S. mediterranea whole-genome shotgun reads
(traces). Of those datasets only NCBI-nr and traces are
discussed here; the former is routinely used on this kind
of analyses, while the latter yielded the largest number
of peptide assignments (unpublished results). MASCOT
assigned 20,107 peptides to spectra for NCBI-nr, which
mapped to 602 protein sequences. Sequences from
traces contained in the “forward” database were reversed
to produce a “decoy” database containing sequences of
the same length and composition but a different distribution of trypsin targets to those from the “forward”;
Figure 3 illustrates the whole process. MASCOT
returned 50 hits per search on each trace database, both
for “forward” and “decoy”. This resulted in 100 hits per
search, for a total MS-fingerprint of 83 different spots.
MASCOT predicted a total of 44,712 and 36,956 peptides for the forward and decoy databases, respectively,
and these were mapped to 8300 unique ORFs (URFs),
corresponding to 23,376 and 26,741 unique peptide
sequences. When the same peptide was mapped on two
or more URFs, the highest score was retrieved. Figure 4
shows the score distribution of the two sets of unique
peptides. Assuming that the decoy database comprised
reversed sequences, it would be expected that none of

Figure 3 Computational screening of protein candidates.
Spectra fingerprints were analyzed by MASCOT, comparing the
experimental peaks against those obtained in silico from sequence
databases. URFs were derived from planarian genome traces. Small
triangles correspond to peptides found by MASCOT, mapped on
candidate protein sequences for both databases, RefSeqs and URFs.
Due to the size of the URFs database, a decoy approach was taken
to select significant protein sequences. Putative protein sequences
were ranked prior to experimental validation, taking into account
MASCOT scores, number of peptide hits per sequence, decoy score,
as well as functional assignment by BLAST2GO.

the peptide scores (the maximum score was chosen when a
peptide was mapped more than once to different open reading
frames). Lower panels: scatter-plots comparing those peptide scores
with the information content, in bits. Above a bit score of 2.5

complexity or repetitive. Decoy score threshold is depicted on all

the peptide hits found there would be real. Assuming
that by chance some of the peptide sequences predicted
for this set could be similar to those from the forward
database, we can thus consider a false-negative error
rate in order to determine a score threshold for both
datasets. On this basis, for a 5% false-negative error rate
in the decoy database, 1337 peptides would be above
the threshold. Ranking the list of peptides, sorting by
score, and taking 5% of the highest scoring peptides, the
score threshold was set at 55 (shown in all panels of
Figure 4 as a vertical blue line). When applying that
score cut-off to the peptides obtained from the forward
database, 1249 of 23,376 unique peptides (5.34%) from
that database were “decoy” filtered. Translating this to
the 8300 URFs used to detect the peptides, 1728 of
these had at least one significant “decoy” peptide
mapped onto it or was aligned with one such URF
sequence. Therefore, 20.82% of the URFs can be considered more reliable than the rest.
The sequences of all the URFs for the forward database
were uploaded into the BLAST2GO software suite [22,23].
The first step was to compare those amino acid sequences
to homologous proteins (using BLASTP against NCBI-nr,
min e-value = 0.001, min hsp length = 25). Of the URFs

Fernández-Taboada et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:133
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/133

with scores above decoy threshold, 1416 (81.94%) had at
least a significant BLAST hit. In contrast, only 636 out of
6572 URFs with scores below the decoy threshold
(10.71%) also had one or more significant BLAST hits. It
was possible then to obtain a functional Gene Ontology
(GO) annotation for those URFs having a BLAST hit
against a known functionally annotated protein. Results of
the functional annotation are summarized in Figure 5.
After GO assignment and the corresponding functional annotation of the sequences derived from our
approach, enzyme codes were mapped by BLAST2GO
when possible. With such codes it was possible to
retrieve the KEGG pathway where the protein may play
its role on the planarian molecular biology. However,
less than one third of the sequences had a homologous
gene/protein BLAST hit–especially for URFs dataset–,
and from those many had a GO functional assignment.

Page 5 of 13

A fraction of the sequences with at least one GO hit
was linked to an enzyme code, which would be related
to a component of the KEGG pathways: 1,670 of 2,804
clusters, mapping to 118 pathways, and 131 of 5,528
clusters, mapping to 35 pathways, for MASCOT results
on RefSeq and URFs respectively. All 35 pathways for
URFs were also found using the RefSeq dataset. The
lower ratio for the URFs set can be explained by species
specific sequences, proteins or functions that are not yet
annotated on the reference databases. 297 RefSeq clustered sequences had a match to 171 enzyme codes for
proteins distributed on the 118 pathways. 16 URFs clustered sequences had a match to 9 enzyme codes for proteins distributed on the 35 pathways. The enzymes can
appear on several pathways, due to the hierarchical
structure of the KEGG a match can be found on both,
a general route as “Metabolic pathway”, and a more

specific process, such as “Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis”.
Among the pathways found, metabolism routes of
sugars and lipids were expected, as energy is required
for cellular processes, regeneration among them. Nevertheless, there are few candidate sequences that will
deserve further analyses, as they appear on pathways
close to development and regeneration: “Selenoamino
acid metabolism”, “Retinol metabolism in animals”, and
“mTOR signaling pathway”. Additional data, including
figures of all those pathways with color-highlighted
boxes for proteins found, is available on the planarian
proteomics web page [24].
Gene profile

As depicted in Figure 5, the annotated proteins cover a
wide range of biological processes, of which four main
groups can be emphasized: proteins involved in energy
production and metabolism (red dots in Figure 5); gene
expression and transcription regulators (yellow squares);
proteins related to development and differentiation (blue
diamonds); and proteins involved in stress-response
pathways and the apoptosis (purple stars). This functional distribution resembles the distributions described
in previous studies of embryonic stem (ES) cells [25],
proliferating cells [26], and differentiating neural stem
cells [27], among others [28-30] (see corresponding
table in Additional File 3). Additional protein sequence
comparisons were performed using NCBI BLAST [31]
(E-value < 10e-3) to extensively compare sets of candidate proteins from our RefSeq and URFs databases with
the sequences described in those studies as stem-cell
related. The same analysis was applied to the genes
reported in two studies using high-throughput
approaches to detect neoblast genes by RNAi-feeding
[32] and by expression macrochip [33] (see corresponding table in Additional File 3). A total of 822 sequences
out of 2801 (29.35%) from the RefSeq dataset and 50
out of 309 (16.18%) from the URFs dataset presented
homology with at least one sequence in any of the studies. Yet only 52 (1.86%) from RefSeq and none from
the URFs dataset had homology with sequences reported
in the planarian studies.
Functional studies

We performed functional analyses on some candidates
from our lists to further assess the quality and accuracy of
the approach used. Candidates were selected from the
RefSeq and the URFs from the traces (see Table 3). In the
case of RefSeq candidates, the sequence was mapped onto
the draft genome and primers were designed to clone a
longer fragment of the protein for subsequent characterization. Three main groups of genes were selected. The
first two groups were proteins belonging to the Ras superfamily of small GTPases and the heat shock proteins

Candidate sequences coming from MASCOT predictions over the RefSeq

their function accurately.

(HSP) family. The third group encompassed unrelated
genes from different spots. The first family includes the
genes Rab-11B, Rab-39 (vesicle and membrane traffic)
[34-36] and Rac-1 (cytoskeleton regulation and apoptosis)
[37,38]. The second family contains HSPs (40, 60 and
70 kDa) involved in a wide variety of processes [39-41].
The last group contained the transcription factor Hunchback-like (related to Drosophila axial polarity and neuroblast lineage) [42], PrkC (a kinase linked to apoptosis and
other processes) [43,44] and LSm proteins (RNA processing and regulation) [45-47]. This gene selection was done
because no direct relation with neoblasts was established
previously, with the exception of the HSPs.
To assess the relationship between these genes and
the neoblasts, we analyzed their expression patterns and
RNAi phenotypes (Figure 6). The observed expression
patterns were variable. Some of the genes were
expressed in the blastema (Figure 6C and 6E), where
neoblasts migrate to after division in order to regenerate
the missing body parts. Others were expressed in
the post-blastema (Figure 6B, D, G, H and 6I), where
the neoblast population is amplified by division to

of selected genes. A, Rab-11B; B, Rab-39; C, Rac-1; D, Hsp40; E, Hsp60; F, Hsp70; G, Hunchback-like; H, PrkC; I, Smed-SmB. Expression analyses by
whole mount in situ hybridization in intact (A1-I1) and regenerating (A2-I2) animals are shown. In regenerating animals, the genes are expressed
in the blastema and postblastema regions, areas where the neoblasts represent the main population during regeneration. In intact animals, the
signal is weak for some of the genes analyzed, although the genes for which expression was detectable presented a pattern with a typical
neoblast distribution. This pattern encompasses the parenchyma of the whole body excluding the gut, pharynx, and the anterior region of the
head. Knock-down experiments by RNA interference were performed to further address the association of the selected genes with neoblasts
(A3-I3). Detectable phenotypes were obtained in all cases except for B3 and G3. A3, E3, F3 and I3 show the phenotypes affecting the
regeneration process, while C3, D3, and H3 show phenotypes affecting the intact animals. Scale bars: 250 μm.

generate the cells that will form the blastema. Finally,
some genes were expressed in both blastema and postblastema (Figure 6A and 6F). These expression patterns
disappeared in late stages of regeneration or developed
over time to correspond to the typical expression pattern for neoblasts, distributed throughout the parenchyma with no expression in the pharynx or at the head
tip anterior to the eyes [5]. In addition, for some of the
genes, expression was only detectable under regeneration conditions, in which neoblasts are known to proliferate at higher rates. In that case, expression was barely
detectable when only a basal number of neoblast cells
was present in intact adult animals (Figure 6C, E and
6G). Therefore, the expression patterns for the candidate genes were consistent with neoblast expression.
Since neoblasts are known to be the only source of
cells for homeostasis and regeneration, the relationship
between the selected genes and the neoblasts was

validated by RNAi experiments [48,49]. All injected animals, both intact and regenerating, died within a few
days or weeks, except in the case of Rab39 and Hunchback-like (Figure 6B and 6G), for which no phenotype
was observed in RNAi experiments. Intact planarians
showed a gradual head regression followed by lysis after
several weeks, as shown in Figure 6C, D and 6H. This
phenotype has been linked to a lack of neoblast cells
available for cell renewal [50]. In addition, regeneration
was completely absent in fragments from RNAi-treated
animals, which produced small blastemas that never differentiated, or no blastema at all with indented wounds,
as illustrated in Figure 6A, E, F and 6I.
In a second screen to validate candidate URFs from
the traces, the expression of some of these genes was
analyzed by comparing intact and irradiated organisms.
Whole-mount in situ hybridization in intact adult
organisms revealed parenchymal expression consistent

Fernández-Taboada et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:133
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/133

with a neoblast distribution, whereas this expression
pattern was not present in irradiated animals
(Figure 7A-B). This is consistent with neoblast-related
genes, since high-dose irradiation destroys neoblasts.
Some genes showed additional expression around the
CNS that may have been associated with a non-dividing
neural precursor cell type. While this expression pattern
remained after irradiation, the signal in the parenchyma
disappeared (Figure 7C-E). Finally, the planarian ortholog of C-type lectin-like was only expressed in the digestive system of irradiated organisms and never in intact
animals (Figure 7F), suggesting a role in cell renewal
under stress conditions, given that the gut has the fastest cell turnover of all tissues. These data provide
further support for the involvement of these candidate
genes in processes linked to neoblast biology, such as
proliferation, cell migration or the regulation of
differentiation.

Discussion
The results of this study show that we have successfully
developed a rapid and reliable method for 2D analysis of
planarian protein samples (Figure 2 and Additional files
1 and 2). This approach will provide the basis for future
proteomics studies that will increase our understanding
of a number of biological processes, in planarians and
beyond, building upon data obtained using genomics
and cDNA-based approaches.
Proteomic studies can help to fill gaps on the annotation of the planarian genome. Despite the large number
of entries already submitted, sequence databases such as
NCBI [51] or UniProt [52] are far from complete.
Recent metagenomic projects have identified novel putative protein sequences not present in current sequence
databases, thus extending the range of biological functions that may be represented [53]. For instance, Yooseph et al [54] report up to 1 in 3 orphan ORFs from
whole-genome shotgun sequencing of marine samples
containing a mixture of prokaryotic organisms. Our
findings indicate that MASCOT can assign substantially
more peaks on those spots selected from 2D gels when
using the Smed_URF database than with NCBI-nr/
RefSeq, as would be expected.
The use of ORF sequences in whole genomes without
prior knowledge of where the genes, mainly the exons, are
located presents a number of issues that can distort the
measures used to discriminate between true and false peptide hits. These include the ratio of coding to non-coding
sequences, which can be quite low (around 2% of coding
regions for the human genome [55]), and the presence of
more repetitive sequences in intergenic regions, despite
the fact that some amino acid repeats are vital functional
and structural regions in proteins [56]. Moreover, the
experimental spectra are compared to simulated ones that

were computed from putative protein-coding regions
directly translated from genomic sequences of the same
species, not from related homologs from different organisms at different phylogenetic distances.
Galindo et al. [57] described a novel family of eukaryotic coding genes consisting of peptides shorter than
50 amino acids (small ORFS [smORFs]) with key biological functions during Drosophila development. Therefore, future searches will have to take this into account,
for instance removing any length constraint when building up the ORF databases.
Identification of proteins

Apart from the presence of metabolic proteins that indicate the high metabolic rate of neoblasts, several of the
proteins detected in this analysis seem to be good candidates to be involved in neoblast-related functions, and
thus in regeneration and tissue homeostasis. One of
those, Smed-SmB, from the LSm family, has been analyzed in detail and shown to be essential for neoblast
proliferation and maintenance [58]. Moreover, other
candidates belonging to the HSP class of proteins have
been linked to the biology of neoblasts in recent studies
[59-61]. The experimental results described in this
paper support the use of an ORF database built upon
genomic sequences from the same species, which yields,
as one might expect, more reliable results in subsequent
proteomic searches, despite assuming nothing about the
coding content of those ORFs. This will bridge the gap
between proteomic and genomic approaches to extend
our knowledge of the functional components of emerging model organisms.
An initial proteomic picture of the neoblasts

The genes identified in this study represent the first
list of neoblast-related candidate genes identified
using a proteomic approach in planarias (Table 3 and
Additional file 4). The results show little correspondence to those of previous genomic studies [32,33].
Interestingly, however, a number of the genes reported
in this analysis were also present in studies designed
to identify stem cell-specific genes in other model
organisms [25-30]. In addition, five of the neoblastrelated genes characterized through our proteomic
approach (Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp70, Chaperonin containing TCP1 theta subunit and Splicing factor 3b subunit
1) have also been analyzed in a planarian transcription
macrochip, but only one of them was detected
(Hsp60) [33]. These findings support our proteomic
strategy as a complement to genomic approaches.
Furthermore, the large number of putative neoblastrelated proteins identified in this proteomic study will
be of invaluable help in future research investigating
the biology of the neoblast.

Conclusions
We have developed a proteomic approach to characterize specific planarian stem-cell (neoblast) proteins. An
accurate and reproducible method for protein purification, 2D gel electrophoresis and MS analysis was defined
and an ORF database of species-specific genomic DNA
was developed for peptide assignment of the retrieved
MS spectra. Subsequent computational analyses yielded
a list of annotated candidate proteins, some of which
were functionally validated as neoblast-specific genes by
RNAi and whole-mount in situ hybridization. Substantial overlap was observed between the candidate genes
identified in our study and those reported from previous
analyses of embryonic stem cells, thus validating the
specificity of the approach. In addition, we detected
novel sequence candidates and expression changes that
merit further investigation in future studies to determine
their role in stem-cell biology.

entries, the original set was split into two databases.
MASCOT results for both sets were then merged to get
the final set of ORFs that had at least one peptide matching spectra. The probability of false matches increases
when large databases, with millions of protein sequences,
are used to detect a wide variety of possible candidate
proteins in a sample [66,67]. To assess the significance of
the peptide hits found by MASCOT, a decoy database
was built by reversing all the URF sequences [68-70]. It
was also split into two, as described above for the “forward” database. MASCOT was run separately on the
decoy databases for all the mass fingerprints previously
analysed with the original URF dataset.

Methods

Sample preparation

Sequences

Protein samples were obtained from whole animals
using a lysis buffer and heating. See Additional File 1
for further details.

The genome of S. mediterranea (strain S2F2) was
sequenced and assembled at the Genome Sequencing
Center (GSC) at Washington University in Saint Louis
(WUSTL) [62,63]. It contains around 800 Mbp distributed on four chromosomes (2n = 8). The latest assembly
version, v3.1 [21], comprises up to 90,000 sequences,
which were reduced to 45,000 by means of pair-ends
sequencing. Lengths of those sequences range from thousands to hundreds of thousands of nucleotides. During
the assembly process, sequencing errors can be fixed by
aligning different traces, but the software can also reduce
polymorphisms and misplace those trace sequences
because of the repeats. In order to overcome those limitations, a database of ORFs was produced directly from
the set of the whole-genome shotgun reads. About 16
million traces were downloaded from the NCBI Trace
Archive [64] and translated, without prior masking, into
the six possible reading frames, taking into account only
those ORF sequences longer than at least 50 amino acids.
The ORFs were stored in a MySQL relational database
along with the original sequences, to make it possible to
retrieve the original nucleotide sequences and design
probes for experimental validation. To reduce the large
amount of sequence data produced and thus speed up
the peptide searches by MASCOT [65], a set of URFs
was derived from the set of ORFs with a checksum function to generate hash keys as unique identifiers for every
sequence. A total of 54,382,803 ORFs were retrieved
from 16,580,722 shotgun reads. This resulted in
28,946,081 URFs with properly formatted sequences to
populate a MASCOT database. As MASCOT was not
able to work with databases larger than 24 million

Irradiation

Intact asexual planarians were irradiated at 75 Gy (1,66
Gy/minute) with a Gammacell 1000 [Atomic Energy of
Canada Limited] [71].

Running 2D gels

First-dimension isoelectric focusing was performed on
immobilized pH gradient strips (24 cm, pH 3-10) using
an Ettan IPGphor system. Second-dimension SDS-PAGE
was performed by laying the strips on 12.5% isocratic
Laemmli gels (24 × 20 cm) cast in low-fluorescence
glass plates on an Ettan DALT system. Details of the
procedure are available in the Additional File 1.
Sample analysis

Gel spots were extracted and digested before analysis by
MS. Then, MASCOT software (Matrix Science, London,
UK) was used to search those spectra on different databases. All spectra were processed by PRIDE Converter
software [72] and were submitted to the PRIDE database
[73], project accession number is 15541. For details see
Additional File 1. After careful selection of score thresholds for the predicted peptides (see the Results section
for the values chosen and the final numbers of the filtered datasets), the sequences that allowed detection of
the URFs were uploaded into BLAST2GO [22,23]. This
software tool facilitates high-throughput integration of
sequence data, homology to related species via NCBIBLAST [31] and functional annotations of DNA or
protein sequences based on the Gene Ontology (GO)
classification [74]. MASCOT output files, selected peptide and protein sequences, as well as BLAS2GO results
and KEGG summary, are available at the planarian proteomics materials web page [24].

Double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA) were produced by
in vitro transcription (Roche) and injected into the gut
of the planarians as described in Sánchez-Alvarado and
Newmark [49]. Three aliquots of 32 nl (400-800 ng/μl)
were injected on three consecutive days with a Drummond Scientific Nanoject injector (Broomall, PA). On
the fourth or fifth day, some of the planarians were
amputated while the rest were left intact. Control organisms were injected with water.

In situ hybridization

Digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes were prepared using
an in vitro labeling kit (Roche). Whole-mount in situ
hybridization was performed as described by Agata et al
[75], with some modifications: proteinase K (20 μg/ml)
treatment for 10 min; triethanolamine treatment was
performed as described by Nogi and Levin [76]; hybridization at 55°C for 18 or 30 h; and final probe concentration of 0.07 ng/μl.

Image scans of different and independent silver-stained 2D gels used in
the study. A to D and the respective zooms, for the regions delimited by
red squares, I to L, come from 100 μg of loaded samples. E to H and the
respective zooms M to P correspond to 500 μg loaded samples. A, C, E
and G are control samples. B, D, F and H are irradiated samples.
Although the staining and running conditions were not exactly
equivalent, one can observe that the spot pattern shown by all the gels
is repetitive, which is more evident on the zoomed regions.

manuscript with previously published studies relating to stem cells.
Comparison of candidate neoblast protein sequences presented in this
paper with genes reported in other proteomic studied to be related to
stem cells [25-30] and with specific neoblast-related genes identified in
two different high-throughput approaches [32,33]. From the URFs
database, only those sequences with a positive decoy were selected.
NCBI BLASTP [31] (min e-value = 0.001) was used on sequence
comparison. Sequences were clustered according to their homology and
they are listed in the table by their original GI identifier from the
corresponding NCBI database.
