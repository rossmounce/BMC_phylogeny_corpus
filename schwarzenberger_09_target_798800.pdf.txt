Abstract
Background: Two major biological stressors of freshwater zooplankton of the genus Daphnia are
predation and fluctuations in food quality. Here we use kairomones released from a planktivorous
fish (Leucaspius delineatus) and from an invertebrate predator (larvae of Chaoborus flavicans) to
simulate predation pressure; a microcystin-producing culture of the cyanobacterium Microcystis
aeruginosa and a microcystin-deficient mutant are used to investigate effects of low food quality.
Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) allows quantification of the impact of
biotic stressors on differential gene activity. The draft genome sequence for Daphnia pulex facilitates
the use of candidate genes by precisely identifying orthologs to functionally characterized genes in
other model species. This information is obtained by constructing phylogenetic trees of candidate
genes with the knowledge that the Daphnia genome is composed of many expanded gene families.
Results: We evaluated seven candidate reference genes for QPCR in Daphnia magna after
exposure to kairomones. As a robust approach, a combination normalisation factor (NF) was
calculated based on the geometric mean of three of these seven reference genes: glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase, TATA-box binding protein and succinate dehydrogenase. Using this NF,
expression of the target genes actin and alpha-tubulin were revealed to be unchanged in the
presence of the tested kairomones. The presence of fish kairomone up-regulated one gene
(cyclophilin) involved in the folding of proteins, whereas Chaoborus kairomone down-regulated the
same gene.
We evaluated the same set of candidate reference genes for QPCR in Daphnia magna after
exposure to a microcystin-producing and a microcystin-free strain of the cyanobacterium
Microcystis aeruginosa. The NF was calculated based on the reference genes 18S ribosomal RNA,
alpha-tubulin and TATA-box binding protein. We found glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and
ubiquitin conjugating enzyme to be up-regulated in the presence of microcystins in the food of D.
magna. These findings demonstrate that certain enzymes of glycolysis and protein catabolism are
significantly upgregulated when daphnids ingest microcystins. Each differentially regulated gene is a
member of an expanded gene family in the D. pulex genome. The cyclophilin, GapDH and UBC genes

show moderately large sequence divergence from their closest paralogs. Yet actin and alpha-tubulin
genes targeteted by our study have nearly identical paralogs at the amino acid level.
Conclusion: Gene expression analysis using a normalisation factor based on three reference
genes showed that transcription levels of actin and alpha-tubulin were not substantially changed by
predator-borne chemical cues from fishes or invertebrates, although changes in expression on the
protein level were shown elsewhere. These changes in protein level could be caused by others than
the investigated paralogs, showing the importance of the construction of phylogenetic trees for
candidate gene approaches. However, fish kairomones caused an up-regulation, and Chaoborus
kairomone caused a down-regulation of cyclophylin, which proved to be a potential target gene for
further analysis of kairomone effects on the life history of daphnids. Changes in food quality
required a different set of reference genes compared to the kairomone experiment. The presence
of dietary microcystins led to an up-regulation of two genes involved in the basic metabolism of D.
magna, i.e. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, which suggests
that microcystins in cyanobacteria have more general effects on the metabolism of D. magna than
previously thought. Phylogenetic trees resolving relationships among paralogs that share the same
gene name are shown to be important for determining the identity of the candidate genes under
investigation.

Background
Notwithstanding other so called 'model organisms', of
which whole genome sequences have been obtained, the
ecology of the model organism Daphnia sp. is outstandingly well known. Therefore it is a challenge to investigate
gene/environment interactions for major ecological interactions of this cladoceran. In most freshwater lakes and
ponds, Daphnia sp. is the major consumer of algae and
cyanobacteria and is also the most important prey for
predatory invertebrates and planktivorous fishes. In line
with its intermediate position in the food chain, Daphnia
sp. populations can be controlled by predation (topdown) or resources (bottom-up). However, the impact of
top-down and bottom-up factors on Daphnia sp. population dynamics shows a pronounced seasonality [1]. Predation pressure is low in spring, but peaks with the
appearance of young-of-the-year fishes and fourth-instar
larvae of Chaoborus water midges in early summer and
remains moderate until fall [2,3]. Bottom-up factors
become a major constraint on Daphnia sp. population
growth, particularly in eutrophic lakes in the summer
when mass developments of toxic cyanobacteria lead to a
suppression of Daphnia sp. biomass [4,5]. The low predictability of intensity and seasonality of both predation
pressure and dominance of toxic cyanobacteria should
lead to the evolution of plastic instead of fixed adaptations [6]. Indeed, adaptive phenotypic plasticity in Daphnia magna to both toxic cyanobacteria and predator-borne
chemical cues has been reported [7-14]. Daphnia magna
has been shown to reduce size at first reproduction (SFR)
in response to kairomones from fish whereas chemical
cues from larvae of Chaoborus flavicans led to increased
SFR; both responses have been proven to be adaptive as
fishes and Chaoborus differ in size-selectivity of their prey
[10-14]. A different kind of phenotypic plasticity consti-

tutes the enhanced tolerance of D. magna against cyanobacterial toxins upon exposure to a toxin producing
cyanobacterium. The recent release of the Daphnia pulex
genome sequence (wFleaBase: http://wFleaBase.org, JGI
Genome Portal: http://www.Jgi.doe.gov/Daphnia/) creates the opportunity to precisely identify candidate genes
that differ in their expression in response to predatorborne chemical cues (i.e. kairomones) and to a toxic
cyanobacterium as a first step to decipher the underlying
molecular mechanisms of adaptive phenotypic plasticity
in D. magna.
Toxin production is a characteristic feature of several
strains of the bloom-forming freshwater cyanobacterium
Microcystis aeruginosa. A large variety of cyclic heptapeptides, termed microcystins (which can become a health
hazard to humans and livestock [15]), have been identified in M. aeruginosa. Wild type M. aeruginosa PCC7806
produces relatively large amounts of two microcystin variants (LR and RR); experiments with a microcystin-free
mutant of this strain [16] have led to the conclusion that
microcystins contribute to the daphnid poisoning by M.
aeruginosa [17,18].
The microcystins of M. aeruginosa PCC7806 are known to
inhibit protein phosphatases 1 and 2A in warm-blooded
animals and in Daphnia sp [19]., which suggests that the
poisoning effect of microcystin-LR in Daphnia sp. is due to
the inhibition of these two protein phosphatases. However, it remains entirely unclear which major physiological pathways in Daphnia sp. are affected by the binding of
microcystin to protein phosphatases 1 and 2A.
For single clones of D. magna it has been shown that they
develop tolerance against a microcystin producing cyanoPage 2 of 15

bacterium [20,21]. Although the physiological mechanisms have not been elucidated, this increased tolerance
can be transferred to the offspring via maternal effects
[20]. For a better understanding of the process of physiological adaptation of daphnids to toxic cyanobacteria, it is
important to examine the genes that are differentially regulated in the presence of microcystins. To achieve this goal
we quantified the expression of a set of genes involved in
the basic metabolism in D. magna when cultured on a M.
aeruginosa PCC7806 mutant in which the production of
microcystins had been knocked out, or on the microcystin-synthesizing wild type strain. As a reference cyanobacterium, we used a strain of Synchecoccus elongatus which is
non-toxic to daphnids [22] and easily ingested; a strain of
the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus which is widely used as
standard food for daphnids was used as reference for high
quality food [23].
Much of the recent evidence for inducible defences in
freshwater ecology which has contributed to the general
understanding of predator-prey interactions has been
derived from experimental studies with daphnids. Despite
considerable progress in the understanding of inducible
defences, the underlying plasticity has rarely been studied
at a molecular level. Only recently has the response of D.
magna to kairomones from fish and invertebrates been

A

investigated on the protein level, and it has been shown
that a clone of D. magna that was isolated from a habitat
where it coexists with fishes and invertebrate predators
responds with a decrease in the proteins actin and alphatubulin [24]. We hypothesized that this decrease might be
due to a change in transcription of the actin and alphatubulin genes and that these genes might function as targets for predator-borne chemical cues. We therefore
exposed the same clone of D. magna as Pijanowska & Kloc
(2004) [24] to similar kairomones and quantified the
transcription levels of putative target genes.

Results
Kairomone experiment: Effects on the life-history of
Daphnia magna
In two different life-history experiments the size at first
reproduction (SFR) of D. magna grown in water exposed
either to sunbleaks (Leucaspius delineatus) or larvae of
Chaoborus flavicans was determined. The SFR of D. magna
grown in fish incubation water was significantly lower
than SFR of the control group (p < 0.001, Tukey HSD after
one-way ANOVA: F8;0.00195 = 33023.42; Fig. 1A), whereas
SFR of D. magna raised in Chaoborus incubation water was
significantly higher than SFR of D. magna grown in kairomone-free water (p < 0.001, Tukey HSD after one-way
ANOVA: F13;0.08364 = 949.3778; Fig 1B).

Kairomone experiment: Relative normalized expression of
the target genes actin and alpha-tubulin
The mean relative expression of actin in the fish-kairomone treatment was significantly higher than in the respective control (Tukey's HSD post-hoc, p < 0.001 after oneway ANOVA: F9;0.00001 = 2037412, p < 0.001; Fig. 3A),
whereas the mean relative expression of actin was significantly lower in the Chaoborus-kairomone treatment than
in its respective control (Tukey's HSD post-hoc, p < 0.001
after one-way ANOVA: F9;0.00001 = 2037412, p < 0.001; Fig.
3B). Chemical cues from fishes led to a 1.75-fold increase
in the relative expression of actin (Fig. 3A), and chemical
cues from Chaoborus larvae decreased actin expression
0.94-fold (Fig. 3B). The standard deviation of the relative
expression of actin across fish-kairomone treatments was
0.53 and was thus around four orders of magnitude
higher than SD in the reference genes (Tab. 1). The standard deviation of the relative expression of actin across
Chaoborus-kairomone treatments was 0.04 and had thus

Kairomone experiment: Identification of reference genes
and normalisation factors
In the kairomone experiment, the relative expression of
the six candidate reference genes in the different treatments was analysed by geNorm (see Methods) and ranked
according to increasing variability (GapDH = SucDH <
TBP < cyclophilin < UBC < 28S < 18S). GeNorm calculated
five normalisation factors. Pair wise comparison of
sequential normalisation factors showed a low level of
variability between the three most stable reference genes
(V2/3; Fig. 2). In accordance with the recommendation of
Vandesompele et al. (2002) [25] to use a minimum
number of three reference genes, the normalisation factor
generated from the three least variable genes (GapDH,
SucDH, TBP) was used for normalisation in further analyses. The normalized values of the three reference genes
showed little variation across treatments, resulting in low
values of SD (Tab. 1, 2).

standard deviation of the relative expression of alpha-tubulin across Chaoborus-kairomone treatments was 0.05 and
had thus almost the same SD across treatments as the reference genes (Tab. 2).
Kairomone experiment: Relative normalized expression of
non-reference genes
The non-reference genes in the fish-treatments (28S, UBC,
18S, cyclophilin) showed values of SD across treatments
(Tab. 3) that were at least four orders of magnitude higher
than those of the normalised values of the three reference
genes (SucDH, GapDH, TBP, SD across treatments <
0.158; Tab. 1). The same non-reference genes in the

Chaoborus-treatment showed values of SD across treatments (Tab. 4) that were at least 1.3 orders of magnitude
higher than those of the normalised values of the three
reference genes (SD across treatments < 0.32; Tab. 2) with
one exception (28S, SD across treatments = 0.15; Tab. 4).
These findings suggested a treatment-dependent expression. All non-reference genes showed significantly different expression between the fish-treatment (Tab. 3), the
Chaoborus treatment and their respective controls (28S: p

of cyclophilin (2.9-fold) by fish kairomone (Tab. 3) and its
down-regulation (0.4-fold) by Chaoborus kairomone (Tab.
4). The other non-reference genes were all up-regulated in
the kairomone treatments relative to their respective control, with a stronger effect of fish kairomone (1.86 - 2.25fold; Tab. 3) than of Chaoborus kairomone (1.21 - 1.82fold; Tab. 4).

Four different treatments were analysed in the microcystin

experimental design. The aim was to be able to differentiate between the wild type and the mutant of M. aeruginosa

(Fig. 4; p < 0.001, Tukey's HSD post-hoc, after one-way

differences in growth on the wild type or the mutant of M.
aeruginosa PCC 7806 were observed after four days (Fig.
4). D. magna on the wild type strain of M. aeruginosa died
on day five, whereas all animals kept on the mutant survived.
Microcystin experiment: Normalisation factors and
identification of reference genes
The relative expression of nine candidate genes was analysed by geNorm and ranked according to increasing variability (TBP = 18S < alpha-tubulin < SucDH < actin <
GapDH < cyclophilin < UBC < 28S). GeNorm calculated
eight normalisation factors. Pair wise comparison of
sequential normalisation factors showed a relatively high
level of variability between the three least variable reference genes (V2/3; Fig. 5). The overall effect of using more
reference genes was rather small. For this reason, and to
simplify experimental handling, only the three least variable genes (TBP, 18S, alpha-tubulin) were used as reference
genes.

After normalisation, all genes were further analysed. The
effects between feeding the wild type or the mutant strain
of M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 were significantly different

whereas the across-treatment variation was several times
higher in three other genes: GapDH (4.91); SucDH (7.20)
and UBC (3.79). These three genes of basic metabolism
were treated as target genes, and we investigated whether
their expression is regulated by the treatments.

Microcystin experiment: Relative expression of the target
genes GapDH, SucDH and UBC following normalisation
The mean relative expression of GapDH in the microcystin-free treatments with S. elongatus, S. obliquus and the
mutant of M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 ranged between 0.1
and 1 (Fig. 6), whereas the treatment with the microcystin-producing strain of M. aeruginosa showed a relative
expression of over 10. The pattern of the relative expression of UBC was similar. Expression in the treatments
with the green alga and the microcystin-free cyanobacteria
ranged between 0.01 and 1, whereas the treatment with
M. aeruginosa wild type showed a relative expression of >
8.0 (Fig. 6). The target gene SucDH showed a higher relative expression in the microcystin-free mutant of M. aeruginosa (4.0-fold; Fig. 6) than in the microcystin-free
treatments with the green alga (1) and S. elongatus (1.92);
however, the relative expression of SucDH in the wild type
of M. aeruginosa was even 16-folds higher than in the calibrator (green alga).
Resolving gene identities by homology to the Daphnia
pulex genome
The D. magna candidate gene sequences were used for protein database searches for D. pulex homologs in the Dappu
v1.1 draft genome sequence assembly (September, 2006)
and annotation. Phylogenetic trees were subsequently
constructed from the aligned amino acids. Fifteen protein
sequences for actin could be found. The protein sequence
of the orthologous actin in the D. pulex sequence (Actin P
= Dappu-306442) clustered with five other sequences
(Fig. 7A). The highest similarity (55%; p-distance 0.7%)
was found with two paralogous sequences (Dappu228751 and Dappu-305550 (Fig. 7B). P-distances ranged
from 0% to 87.7% indicating a very high variability
between all of the actin paralogs. Sixteen D. pulex proteins
with significant sequence similarity to cyclophilin could
be found. The cyclophilin protein sequence of the orthologous D. pulex sequence (Cyclo P = Dappu-92663) clustered with another sequence (Dappu-215551; p-distance
32%; Fig. 7D). Cyclophilin showed a very high variability
with p-distances between 25.2% and 98.1%. For GapDH
six significant protein sequence hits could be revealed.

Discussion
The occurrence of cyclic heptapeptides, termed microcystins, is widespread in cyanobacteria and not restricted
to the genus Microcystis; mass development of microcystin-producing cyanobacteria can constitute a high risk for
intoxication of humans and livestock [27]. Numerous
studies have been carried out in order to determine the
ecological significance of microcystin production in
cyanobacteria. The availability of the mcy- mutant of
PCC7806, which is genetically identical to the wild type
except for its inability to synthesize microcystins [16],
made it possible to more precisely analyse the role of
microcystins in daphnid poisoning. Life-table experiments with the wild type and the mcy- mutant of
PCC7806 with Daphnia galeata have shown that the wild
type was poisonous to D. galeata, whereas the mutant
strain had no lethal effects [17,18]. These findings and
similar results for D. magna [28] suggest that microcystins
play a role in the defence of M. aeruginosa against zooplankton grazing.
Feeding on the cyanobacterium M. aeruginosa led to significantly reduced growth of D. magna compared to animals grown on the high quality food alga S. obliquus [23]
or the non-toxic cyanobacterium S. elongatus [22].
Although there was reduced growth in D. magna feeding
on M. aeruginosa compared to the reference cyanobacterium, there was no difference between the wild type and
the mcy- mutant treatment. However, a specific microcystin effect became evident on day five, when D. magna

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/527

raised on the wild type strain died, whereas no mortality
was observed in D. magna raised on the mutant strain.
In an in-vitro system, microcystin-LR has been shown to
inhibit protein phosphatases 1 and 2A in crude extracts of
Daphnia sp [19]. However protein phosphatase 1 and 2A
each comprise a family of protein serine/threonine phosphatases with a wide range of different specificities that
are mediated by different interactors [29] and regulatory
subunits [29,30]. Hence it remains entirely unclear which
specific physiological pathways in daphnids are affected
by the binding of microcystin to protein phosphatases 1
and 2A.
Here for the first time in-situ effects of dietary microcystins on gene expression of daphnids were investigated.
The experiments presented in this paper were designed to
identify genes involved in the general metabolism in D.
magna in which the expression level responds to the presence of microcystins. We therefore compared the effects of
the microcystin-producing wild type M. aeruginosa
PCC7806 and the mcy- mutant of this strain on the relative expression of genes involved in basic metabolism. We
found substantial up-regulation of GapDH (Dappu302823) and UBC (Dappu-120690) in response to the
presence of microcystins in the food of D. magna, which
demonstrates that certain enzymes of glycolysis and protein catabolism are significantly up-regulated when daphnids ingest microcystins. For the first time a specific gene
regulation in response to dietary microcystins has been
demonstrated in daphnids. This up-regulation might have
enabled D. magna to avoid a microcystin-specific depression of growth until day four but could not prevent mortality on day five of the growth experiment.
Upon exposure to the microcystin-producing wild type of
M. aeruginosa PCC7806, D. magna has been shown to
develop a tolerance against this toxic strain within an individual's lifespan and to transfer this tolerance to the next
generation through maternal effects, a fact that has been
interpreted as an inducible defence against microcystin
[8]. It remains to be tested which role the observed up-regulation of GapDH and UBC plays in the inducible tolerance of D. magna to microcystins. Furthermore, clones of
D. magna have been shown to differ in their tolerance to
M. aeruginosa PCC7806 [31], which suggests a genetic
basis for increased toxin tolerance. It remains to be investigated whether the up-regulation of GapDH and UBC
contributes to the tolerance to M. aeruginosa PCC7806.
In addition to the microcystins in PCC7806 wild type,
both the wild type and mcy- mutant PCC7806 produce
other classes of secondary metabolites of unknown biological activity [32,33]. D. magna feeding on either of
these two strains revealed a substantial up-regulation of

Page 10 of 15

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:527

SucDH, and it remains to be seen which cyanobacterial
compounds induce this up-regulation of a key enzyme of
the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In order to account for possible general effects of cyanobacteria on expression of the
investigated genes, we fed Synechococcus elongatus to D.
magna. This cyanobacterium is easily ingested by daphnids and does not contain toxins or inhibitors [22]. The
effects of S. elongatus on GapDH, UBC and SucDH were
negligible compared to the afore mentioned effects of M.
aeruginosa, which indicates that the up-regulation of the
tested loci of GapDH, UBC and SucDH in D. magna is a
specific and not a general response to cyanobacterial secondary metabolites. It would be interesting to see, if this
holds true for all different paralogs of the affected genes or
if the up-regulation is restricted to specific clusters or single paralogs of these highly variable genes (Fig. 7E-F).
Predation is an important stressor in aquatic communities, and many studies using Daphnia sp. have contributed
to an understanding of the adaptive value of inducible
anti-predator defences in the genus Daphnia. Achieving a
better understanding of the mechanisms and constraints
of the evolution of inducible anti-predator defences
requires more research on the mechanisms of inducible
defences at the molecular level. Only recently has this
field been started to be explored. Our work was stimulated
by the paper of Pijanowska & Kloc, (2004) [24], who used
a clone of D. magna which has been shown to be plastic
with regard to life-history traits and behaviour
[10,11,13,14,34] in response to kairomones from fish and
Chaoborus. Pijanowska & Kloc (2004) [24] have shown a
dramatic decrease of the proteins actin and alpha-tubulin
in this clone of D. magna when it was exposed to kairomones from planktivorous fish or the larvae of Chaoborus
water midges. These identical effects of vertebrate and
invertebrate kairomones suggested that actin might play a
major role in anti-predator responses in D. magna in general. Using the same clone of D. magna, we here demonstrate that an exposure to chemical cues from both
invertebrate and vertebrate predators results in a change
in actin expression. However, although significant, the
1.75-fold (fish) increase and 0.94-fold (invertebrate)
decrease in actin expression was rather moderate and did
not reflect the dramatic decrease of the protein actin
reported by Pijanowska & Kloc [24]. The same holds true
for the weak although significant increase in the gene
alpha-tubulin in the fish (1.71) and the Chaoborus treatments (1.07). Since we found two possible alpha-tubulin
orthologous protein sequences in D. pulex, which were
very similar to each other (Fig. 7C), we concluded that the
effect on the expression holds true for all paralogs in their
cluster. Therefore, the substantial decrease of actin and
alpha-tubulin on the protein level reported by Pijanowska
& Kloc [24] could be a posttranslational process, e.g.
miRNA-mediated regulation or increased degradation, as
has been suggested by the authors [24]. We conclude that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/527

these loci of actin and alpha-tubulin are no strong target
genes for anti-predator defences. However, construction
of phylogenetic trees reveals very high variability between
the different paralogs of actin and alpha-tubulin (Fig. 7AC). It remains to be tested if the decrease of actin and
alpha-tubulin on the protein level reported by Pijanowska
& Kloc [24] is caused by another paralogous sequence
sharing the same gene name.
Following normalisation to NF, it turned out that the
expression of 28S, UBC, 18S and cyclophilin was affected
by the type of kairomone. Genes involved in protein biosynthesis (18S, 28S) and protein catabolism (UBC) were
up-regulated by kairomone. These effects were considerably stronger for fish kairomone. The expression of cyclophylin (Dappu-92663), a gene involved in protein folding,
was up-regulated in the presence of kairomones from vertebrate and down-regulated by kairomones from invertebrate predators. The finding that the two kairomones
differ in their effect on cyclophylin in D. magna is in accord
with the observation that the life-history response of this
clone of D. magna differs between kairomones released
from fish or Chaoborus [24]. Cyclophilin, could serve as a
potential target gene for further analysis of kairomone
effects on daphnids. It remains to be seen how cyclophilin
is involved in mediating kairomone effects on life history
of daphnids and if this is specific to the orthologous
sequence and to related paralogous sequences of cyclophilin.
Our study is the first detailed study that investigates effects
of kairomones from vertebrate and invertebrate predators
and of microcystin on gene expression of genes involved
in different basic metabolic processes in D. magna. Kairomones from both vertebrate and invertebrate predators
led to the well-established adaptive shifts in SFR in D.
magna giving evidence for biologically active incubation
water from either predator. Similarly, evidence for specific
effects of microcystin comes from the higher mortality of
D. magna on the wild type strain than on the mutant of M.
aeruginosa PCC 7806. Calculating a combination normalisation factor based on the geometric mean of three genes
for the kairomone experiment and for the growth experiment, stressor-specific regulation of some of the genes
involved in basic metabolism is demonstrated.
All target genes in Daphnia show a surprisingly high variability between paralogs. If such a high variability holds
true for other genes in D. magna, this could hint at a highly
plastic genome, which might be adaptive for an animal
that living in a very complex aquatic environment and
therefore has to maintain a high potential for adaptations.

Conclusion
Three (GapDH, TBP, SucDH) of the seven genes investigated (GapDH, TBP SucDH, 28S, UBC, 18S, cyclophilin)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:527

were found to be stable across the kairomone treatments
and were used as reference genes for normalization.
Although significant, no substantial kairomone-dependent regulation of actin and alpha-tubulin was found, indicating that the dramatic decrease of actin and alphatubulin at the protein level in response to kairomones
(reported earlier) was not due to a regulation of the transcription of the actin and alpha-tubulin loci investigated
here. Therefore these gene loci cannot serve as target genes
in the analysis of kairomone effects on D. magna. If this
holds true for the other paralogs sharing the same gene
name remains to be tested. However, the expression of
other genes involved in protein biosynthesis, protein
catabolism and protein folding, especially the regulation
of cyclophilin by kairomones, indicated major effects on
protein folding. These genes have the potential to serve as
target genes in further analysis of kairomone effects on the
life history of daphnids.
Three genes (i.e. 18S, TBP, alpha-tubulin) proved to be stable across microcystin-free and microcystin-containing
cyanobacterial food treatments and were used for normalization. Two of the candidate genes (UBC and GapDH)
were shown to have toxin-specific regulation and were
clearly up-regulated when microcystins were present in
the food. This indicates that microcystins strongly affect
protein catabolism and glycolysis in D. magna when the
animals ingest microcystins via the natural route of exposure, i.e. uptake of microcystin-containing food items; it
remains to be seen which role the observed up-regulation
of GapDH and UBC plays in the inducible tolerance of D.
magna to microcystins.
The construction of phylogenetic trees is an essential step
in target gene analysis in Daphnia in order to account for
the high variability between different paralogs. Phylogenetic trees of the different paralogs are indispensable for
clustering the utilized loci with similar ones and to delineate them from others. Related paralogs might have a similar relevance within the genome. This approach is
especially important in an organism like Daphnia sp. with
p-distances showing a very high variability between different paralogs.

Methods
Test species and cultures
A clone of Daphnia magna originating from Lake Binnensee, Germany, inhabited by fishes and various invertebrates, was cultured at 20Â°C in membrane-filtered tap
water (conductivity: 740 Î¼S/l; pH 7.2; major ions: Ca2+
(110 mg/l) and HCO3- (270 mg/l)).

Fifteen animals per litre were kept under non-limiting
food concentrations (2 mg Cpart/l) with Scenedesmus obliquus (SAG-276-3a) (Stammsammlung fÃ¼r Algen, GÃ¶ttin-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/527

gen, Germany) as food alga. Only third clutch neonates
which had been born within 12 h were used for the experiments.
The green alga Scenedesmus obliquus, the cyanobacteria
Synechococcus elongatus (SAG 89.79) and Microcystis aeruginosa (UTEX LB 2063 and PCC 7806), and a genetically
engineered microcystin synthetase knock out mutant of
Microcystis aeruginosa (PCC 7806 mcy- [16]) were cultivated semi-continuously in cyanophyceen medium [35]
at 20Â°C, with half of the medium exchanged weekly. The
medium consisted of 0.6 mM CaCl2 Ã 2 H20, 0.8 mM
NaNO3, 0.4 mM K2HPO4 Ã 3 H2O, 0.4 mM MgSO4 Ã 7
H2O, 0.01 mM NaFeEDTA, 0.8 mM KCl, 100 Î¼M H3BO3
and 20 Î¼M Na2MoO4 Ã 2 H2O and had a pH of 8.5.
Cyanobacteria were cultivated with constant light at 95
Î¼E, S. obliquus at 130 Î¼E. Carbon concentrations of the
autotrophic food suspensions were estimated from photometric light extinction (800 nm) and from carbonextinction equations previously determined.
Experimental design
Kairomone experiment
Fish-conditioned water was prepared by exposing four
sunbleaks (Leucaspius delineatus) in 4 l of tap water at
20Â°C for 24 h without feeding during the whole experiment. The fishes were stopped being fed for 24 h prior to
the experiment; the water thus did not contain any faeces.

The Chaoborus incubation water was prepared by exposing
60 fourth-instar larvae of Chaoborus flavicans (which had
previously been allowed to feed on zooplankton for 4 h
each day of the experiment) in 1 l of tap water at 15Â°C for
20 h.
Predator-conditioned water was filtered (GFF), and in
case of fish-conditioned water diluted 1:4, prior to introducing D. magna. From a cohort of D. magna neonates
that had been born within 12 h from synchronized mothers, five animals each were exposed in 250 ml glass containers to predator-conditioned or control water from
birth until maturity. All treatments were run in triplicate.
D. magna were fed the green alga S. obliquus (4 mg Cpart/
l); the media were changed daily. At the day when the 1st
clutch was visible size at first reproduction (SFR) was
determined as the size of the egg-bearing D. magna. For
each replicate a mean SFR was calculated, and these mean
values were used to calculate the respective mean value
and the variance for the treatment.
Microcystin experiment
From a cohort of new born D. magna, 8-10 animals each
were transferred to 1 l of tap water with a food concentration of 2 mg Cpart/l. The animals were either fed the green
alga S. obliquus as a control for high quality food or one of

the three cyanobacteria. Each day the medium and the
food were exchanged. The experiment took place under
low light conditions at 20Â°C and lasted for four days for
the real-time PCR analysis. All food treatments were run
in triplicate, and somatic growth rates of D. magna were
determined from dry weight of animals collected at the
start and at day four of the experiment. according to [23].
RNA extraction and reverse transcription
At the end of the experiments the animals' RNA was
extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). In order to
remove any traces of genomic DNA, the RNA was treated
with Desoxyribonuclease I (Fermentas) following the
manufacturer's instructions. The integrity of the RNA was
verified with 1.5% agarose gel electrophoreses. RNA concentrations were determined with a Qubit Fluorometer
(Invitrogen). 1 Î¼g of RNA was reverse transcribed using
the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit
(Applied Biosystems). The cDNA was diluted 50-fold
resulting in total RNA concentrations of 1 ng/Î¼l. The
cDNA was stored at -20Â°C.
Quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR)
Nine different housekeeping genes recently introduced for
QPCR in D. magna by Heckmann et al. (2001) [26] were
used in QPCR analysis: actin, alpha-tubulin, cyclophilin,
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GapDH), succinate dehydrogenase (SucDH), TATA-box binding protein
(TBP), ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (UBC), 18S ribosomal
RNA (18S), 28S ribosomal RNA (28S).

QPCR was conducted on the 7300 real time PCR system
(Applied Biosystems). Each reaction contained 5 Î¼l of
cDNA template, 10 Î¼l Power SYBRÂ® Green PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems) and 2.5 Î¼M of each primer in a final
volume of 20 Î¼l. Each reaction was conducted in triplicate. Cycling parameters were 95Â°C for 10 min to activate
the DNA polymerase followed by 40 cycles of 95Â°C for 15
s and 60Â°C for 1 min. After the actual analysis, dissociation curves were performed to verify that no primer-dimers had been amplified. Outliers and samples diverging
from the dissociation curve were omitted.
Data analysis and statistics
The raw data were analysed after QPCR. Because of the
differing amplification efficiencies of the primer pairs
[26], the relative expressions were calculated as quantities
using the formula WR = (E+1)(CTmin-CTx) (a modification
of the 2-ÎÎCT Method [36]), in which WR is a quantity for
the relative expression of one sample, E is the amplification efficiency of its assay, CTmin is the lowest threshold
cycle of all samples of this assay, and CTx is the threshold
cycle of the analysed sample. The quantities could then be
imported into geNorm version 3.4 [25], an Excel (Microsoft) based tool which calculates the minimum required

number and best-suited combination from a given set of
reference genes and from that generates a "normalisation
factor" to be used for stable normalisation of QPCR measurements.
After determination of a normalisation factor from the set
of reference genes, the raw data of the QPCR runs were
imported into qBase version 1.3.5 [37], an Excel (Microsoft) based tool which calculates relative gene expression
normalised using the normalisation factor generated with
geNorm. D. magna fed entirely with S. obliquus served as
calibrator which was always set as 1.
The growth rates and the body length were (Ã2)-1 transformed when needed to ensure homogeneity of variances
and analysed with ANOVA and Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) for post hoc comparisons to assess
differences in relative expression.
The data generated with qBase were log-transformed
when needed to ensure homogeneity of variances and
analysed with ANOVA and Tukey's honestly significant
difference (HSD) for post hoc comparisons to assess differences in relative expression.
The statistics were performed with Statistica 6.0.
Database search and construction of phylogenetic trees
To compare the Daphnia magna sequences with the Daphnia pulex database http://wfleabase.org and to discover
homologs in the genome for the genes of interest, the D.
magna sequences of the target genes actin, alpha-tubulin,
cyclophilin, GapDH and UBC [26] were used as queries for
sequence similarity searches using BLASTn against the
Dappu v1.1 draft genome assembly in wFleabase. The best
alignments with the highest score was taken as the
ortholog for the sequence of interest in D. pulex. Its protein sequence was subsequently used to query for additional homologs using BLASTp (blastp; e-value cut off
limit = 0.01) against the the v1.1 gene builds (July, 2007)
archived in wFleaBase. All protein sequences with a significant hit were taken and aligned (BioEdit v.7.0.5.3 [38])
with the orthologous protein sequence. Using the program MEGA 4 [39] Neighbor-Joining trees with Bootstrap
Test of Phylogeny were constructed and p-distances were
calculated. Hypothetically, the D. pulex trees and the D.
magna trees are approximately identical.
