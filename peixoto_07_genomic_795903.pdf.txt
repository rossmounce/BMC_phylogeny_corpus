The protozoan phylum Apicomplexa is comprised of
>5000 species, including Toxoplasma gondii (a prominent
opportunistic infection in AIDS), and the Plasmodium
parasites responsible for malaria. Complete genome
sequences are now available for several apicomplexan
species, including both T. gondii and Plasmodium falciparum, making it possible to exploit comparative phylogenomic tools for insight into adaptations associated with
intracellular parasitism, and in order to identify targets
for therapeutic development. These parasites harbor a
novel organelle, the 'apicoplast', which was acquired by
endosymbiotic capture of a eukaryotic alga, and thus
provides a dramatic example of lateral gene transfer
(LGT). In order to determine the overall impact of LGT,
we have employed phylogeny reconstruction to detect
transfers on a genomicscale. Trees have been constructed
for all genes in the Toxoplasma and Plasmodium
genomes, and compared with a whole genome species
treederived from 55 taxa represented in the orthologous
protein database OrthoMCL-DB [1]. Non-apicomplexan
specific ortholog groups containing4 to 100 sequences
were examined, pruning outlying species based on their
degree of connectivity to the group as a whole, and
robustness of the resulting tree.

A pilot study based on intensive manual curation of T.
gondii genes coding for metabolic enzymes estimates that
~15% of these genes were acquired by LGT. Turning to
the entire parasite genome(s), Horizstory software identifies 1552 groups where T. gondii gene placement contrasts with the species tree, and 1520 instances of
potential LGTinvolving P. falciparum. In order to identify
the most probable LGT events, we developed a strategy
that ranks the probability ofLGT based on the taxonomic
consistency of results for sibling species within the tree,
and bootstrap support for the relevant internalnode(s).
This 'LGTsmart' strategy yields a ranked list of probable
lateral gene transfer events (Figure 1) including 226 high
confidence events that occurred at different times during
the course of apicomplexan evolution. Many of these
transfers involve genes exhibiting phylogenetic affinity
with plants, consistent with the algal origin of the apicoplast endosymbiont. Additional, more recent, transfers
appear to have a bacterial origin, and both classes of
genes include promising targets for drug development.
Interestingly, we also detected LGT of metazoan-like
genes, possibly acquired through interaction with the
host during adaptation to the parasitic lifestyle.
