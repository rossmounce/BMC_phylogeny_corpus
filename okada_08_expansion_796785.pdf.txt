Abstract
Background: The adaptive immune system (AIS) of jawed vertebrates is a sophisticated system
mediated by numerous genes in specialized cells. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that emergence of
the AIS followed the occurrence of two rounds of whole-genome duplication (2R-WGD) in early
vertebrates, but little direct evidence linking these two events is available.
Results: We examined the relationship between 2R-WGD and the gain of AIS-related functions
by numerous genes. To analyze the evolution of the many genes related to signal transduction in
the AIS (defined as AIS genes), we identified groups of genes (defined as AIS subfamilies) that
included at least one human AIS gene, its paralogs (if any), and its Drosophila ortholog(s). Genomic
mapping revealed that numerous pairs of AIS genes and their paralogs were part of paralogons –
series of paralogous regions that derive from a common ancestor – throughout the human genome,
indicating that the genes were retained as duplicates after 2R-WGD. Outgroup comparison analysis
revealed that subfamilies in which human and fly genes shared a nervous system-related function
were significantly enriched among AIS subfamilies, as compared with the overall incidence of shared
nervous system-related functions among all subfamilies in bilaterians. This finding statistically
supports the hypothesis that AIS-related signaling genes were ancestrally involved in the nervous
system of urbilaterians.
Conclusion: The current results suggest that 2R-WGD played a major role in the duplication of
many signaling genes, ancestrally used in nervous system development and function, that were later
co-opted for new functions during evolution of the AIS.

Background
The AIS in jawed vertebrates is a sophisticated system
mediated by numerous genes in specialized cells [1].
Because the AIS is conserved widely among jawed vertebrates but not invertebrates [2], it is widely held that the
AIS appeared suddenly, as an immunologic "big bang," in
the common ancestor of jawed vertebrates [3]. The
recently sequenced genome of Stringylocentrotus purpuratus

(purple sea urchin)[4], one of the closest relatives of chordates, has revealed that although they lack an AIS, sea
urchins have almost all of the vertebrate gene repertoire,
including many genes involved in the AIS [4,5]. This situation indicates that many of the genes involved in the AIS
arose long before the emergence of jawed vertebrates (or
at least that of the common ancestor of jawed vertebrates
and sea urchins) and thereafter evolved concurrently to

gain new functions in the AIS at the immunologic big
bang.
Gene duplications are important evolutionary paths for
the acquisition of new functions, because one copy of a
duplicated gene can accumulate mutations and acquire
novel functions while the other retains the original function. Such duplications can involve individual genes,
genomic segments, or whole genomes. Because they generate a large number of gene duplicates concurrently,
whole-genome duplications (WGDs) are considered particularly important evolutionary events [6]. It has long
been hypothesized that a WGD occurred twice in early
vertebrates (two rounds of whole-genome duplication,
2R-WGD)[6]. This hypothesis has recently been supported by clear patterns of four-way paralogous regions
occurring throughout the human genome [7,8].
Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the occurrence of 2RWGD preceded emergence of the AIS [2]; therefore, 2RWGD may have been important in the acquisition of AISrelated functions by numerous genes at immunologic big
bang. However, 2R-WGD has been directly linked to limited AIS-related genes that are located in only a few paralogons in the human genome [2,9,10], indicating that the
genes arose from 2R-WGD. These currently available
examples are too limited to reveal the precise relationship
between 2R-WGD and the acquisition of AIS-related functions by the numerous genes involved in this system.
We focus here on many signaling genes in the AIS and
investigate the extent to which 2R-WGD contributed to
their gains of function in the AIS. In addition, to provide
insight into the ancestral status of the AIS-related genes
before 2R-WGD, we compared these genes with their
orthologs in an invertebrate (Drosophila) that lacks an AIS.

Results
Molecular functions of paralogs in paralogons formed in
early vertebrates
By using an anchoring strategy combined with a phylogenetic approach [8], we identified in the human genome
357 paralogons including 2842 BV paralogous genes
(formed at the Base of the Vertebrate lineage). An impor-

tant first step in demonstrating that 2R-WGD indeed was
important in the evolution of genes involved in the AIS
would be to show the types of genes that were retained
after duplication by 2R-WGD. To this end, we used Gene
Ontology (GO) annotations to investigate the molecular
roles of the BV paralogous genes. GO terms such as "regulation of biological process" (GO term ID:0050789; P =
4.05 × 10-14) and "signal transduction" (GO term
ID:0007165; P = 9.52 × 10-24) were over-represented
among the BV paralogous genes (Table 1), as indicated in
previous WGD studies [11-15]. We therefore focused on
genes in the AIS with molecular roles related to the overrepresented GO terms and examined the relationship
between the evolution of these genes and 2R-WGD.
Detection of AIS subfamilies
In the AIS, signal transduction machineries play indispensable roles as mediators between the diverse extracellular
stimuli received by membrane-bound receptors and various induced biological processes. We focused on an antigen-recognition receptor pathway, chemokine receptor
pathway, and cytokine receptor pathway as representatives of the various signal transduction machineries in the
AIS. We prepared a list of the 61 families of human genes
(defined as AIS families) that comprise these three signaling pathways (see Additional File 1) and that include
many genes essential to the AIS [1].

If the genes in an AIS family have emerged at or before the
divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes, then the
AIS family will encompass one or more subfamilies, each
of which will include all the descendants of a single ancestral gene in the common ancestor of protostomes and
deuterostomes (i.e., the ancestral bilaterian). We comprehensively identified such subfamilies by applying a clustering algorithm to the complete gene sets of one
invertebrate (Drosophila) and three vertebrates (human,
mouse, and medaka) and investigated whether any of the
AIS families contained one or more resulting subfamilies.
Consequently, 93% (57 of 61) of the AIS families encompassed at least one subfamily (see Additional File 1), indicating that their ancestral genes existed in the ancestral
bilaterian.

However, in the case of AIS families with multiple subfamilies, one or more subfamilies may not contain any
AIS-related genes, because each AIS family can include
genes that are not involved in the AIS. By using published
information on the AIS-related functions of each gene in
the subfamilies of all AIS families, we identified 50 subfamilies that each included at least one member gene
involved in the AIS (defined as an AIS gene); the 50 subfamilies were defined as "AIS subfamilies" (see Additional
Files 2, 3). Because each subfamily included all the
descendants of a single ancestral gene in the common
ancestor of protostomes (i.e., Drosophila) and deuterostomes (i.e., human, mouse, and medaka), an AIS subfamily included at least one human AIS gene, its
paralog(s) (if any), and its Drosophila ortholog(s).
Timing of gene duplications in AIS subfamilies
We found that 84% (42 of 50) of the AIS subfamilies
included multiple human genes (Additional Files 2, 3),
indicating that the numbers of subfamily members
increased through gene duplication after the divergence of
protostomes and deuterostomes. To clarify the timing of
the duplications, we conducted phylogenetic analyses of
the AIS subfamilies. Examination of the resulting phylogenetic trees showed that 88% of the total duplications (65
of 74) in the AIS subfamilies occurred in the early vertebrate lineage (i.e., before the divergence of fish and tetrapods; see Additional Files 4, 5).
Genomic mapping analysis
To determine whether gene duplications in the AIS subfamilies occurred as a result of 2R-WGD, we conducted a
genomic mapping analysis, in which we considered that if
two genes of a given paralogous pair were located in the
separate two regions of a paralogon, the genes were
retained as duplicates from 2R-WGD. For example, three
members of the JAK (Janus kinase) subfamily – JAK1,
JAK2, and JAK3 – are located on human chromosomes 1,
9, and 19, respectively. The analysis revealed that the pairs
of these members were part of paralogons (see Additional
File 6), indicating that these genes were retained as duplicates from 2R-WGD. To visualize the relationships of the
members' locations and paralogons, we used red lines to
connect the genomic map positions of the members,
whereas we used gray lines to connect the genes in each BV
paralogous pair of paralogons in the human genome. The
red lines lay within the groups of gray lines (Fig. 1A), indicating that all of the paralog pairs in the JAK subfamily
were part of paralogons. A total of 67% (90 of 134) of the
paralog pairs in all AIS subfamilies were part of paralogons (see Additional Files 6, 7), and this rate is significantly higher than that expected due to chance (P = 1.63 ×
10-50, assuming binomial distribution under the null
hypothesis that paralogs are located randomly throughout the human genome).

Use of large-scale microarray analysis to detect tissues and
organs in which the genes in AIS subfamilies are expressed
at high levels
In the widely accepted "gene duplication and divergence"
model [6], after gene duplication, a new function will be
acquired by one of the duplicates as a result of accumulated mutations while the original function is retained by
the other. Because AIS-related functions were acquired
after 2R-WGD, ancestral non-AIS-related functions might
be retained by the human genes in AIS subfamilies. To
investigate the functional diversity among the human
genes in the AIS subfamilies, we used large-scale microarray expression profiles of various human organs and tissues [16]. For a broad overview of tissue- and organspecific expression, we used a classification scheme (see
Additional File 8) that is a simplified version of Cell Catalogue [17] to classify all 79 tissues and organs used in the
microarray data into 11 system-level function categories;
we then assigned these categories to the human genes in
the AIS subfamilies: if a gene was specifically expressed in
at least one of the tissues or organs in a system-level function category, then the system-level function category was
assigned to the gene (see Additional File 9). We then
assigned a system-level function category to an AIS subfamily if the AIS subfamily included at least one member
gene having the system-level function category. Consequently we found that the categories "nervous system"
(NS), "innate immunity", "muscle tissue", AIS, and
"blood" were significantly enriched (P < 0.05; calculated
by using hypergeometric distribution with Bonferroni correction) among AIS subfamilies as compared with the
overall distribution of these categories among all subfamilies (Fig. 2 and see Additional File 9) detected among
the complete gene sets of three vertebrates (human,
mouse, and medaka) and one invertebrate (Drosophila).
This result indicates that the human genes in these AIS
subfamilies have not only AIS-related functions but also
other functions, particularly those related to the NS,
innate immunity, muscle tissue, and blood, all of which
can be considered as candidates of ancestral functions of
AIS subfamilies.
Outgroup comparison for inferring the ancestral functions
of genes in AIS subfamilies
We assigned the categories NS, innate immunity, muscle
tissue, and blood to the Drosophila genes in the AIS subfamilies according to their FlyBase annotations [18] (see
Additional File 10). To infer the ancestral categories of the
AIS subfamilies, we used the outgroup comparison
method [19], which assumes that the categories shared
between the ingroup and outgroup are relatively primitive
with respect to those found only in the ingroup. That is,
by comparing assigned categories of human (i.e.,
ingroup) and Drosophila (i.e., outgroup) genes in an AIS
subfamily, we assigned the shared categories across these

to each of 71% (34 of 48; two subfamilies were not con-

sidered because their human genes lacked probes for this
analysis) of the AIS subfamilies; particularly, the NS category was assigned to most (58%, 28 of 48) of the AIS sub-

families (Table 2). Furthermore, we found that the NS
category was significantly over-represented among the AIS
subfamilies as compared with the overall distribution of
this category among all subfamilies (P = 9.26 × 10-15; calculated by using hypergeometric distribution); this overrepresentation of the NS category was more significant
than that of any other category (Table 2). These results
suggest that an ancestral function of the AIS subfamilies
was associated with the NS.
Gene usage of AIS subfamilies in the NS and AIS
Large-scale microarray data [16] enabled us to examine
the statistical significance of the enrichment of the systemlevel function categories among the AIS subfamilies and
revealed that the most significantly enriched category
among the AIS subfamilies was NS. To precisely assess

gene usage in the NS and AIS among the AIS subfamilies,
we listed the NS- and AIS-related functions of the human
genes in the AIS subfamilies according to data in the published literature (see Additional File 11). Most of the
human genes in the AIS families (43%, 56 of 129) were
used in either the NS or AIS, suggesting that the functions
of these genes are specialized for the respective system (see
Additional File 11). In contrast, 44 genes (34%, 44 of
129) were used in both the NS and AIS (see Additional
File 11), although whether the genes have different or
similar functions in each system is unclear.

Discussion
Because most traces of 2R-WGD have been deleted by subsequent gene loss and genomic rearrangement [8,20],
direct evidence linking 2R-WGD and expansion of AIS

subfamilies is difficult to obtain by analyzing the membership of AIS subfamilies. A 4:1 ratio in the number of
vertebrate to invertebrate genes in a family (e.g., Hox clusters [21]) is considered to reflect an effect of 2R-WGD.
However, because of massive gene loss after 2R-WGD, few
AIS subfamilies include four human genes (see Additional
File 3). Likewise, the phylogenetic timing of duplications
in AIS subfamilies is inconclusive, because duplications
can occur on every branch. Although the number of duplications was increased somewhat in the early vertebrate
lineage (Additional File 5 and as found previously [22]),
this increase may simply indicate that this evolutionary
period was associated with accelerated small-scale gene
duplication or a reduced rate of gene loss, rather than
WGD. However, the genomic mapping analysis, which
examined the relationship between the genomic map
positions of members in AIS subfamilies and those of BV
paralogous genes in paralogons, yielded conclusive evidence of the role of 2R-WGD in the expansion of the AIS
subfamilies. This analysis revealed that most of the paralogous pairs in AIS subfamilies were part of paralogons in
the human genome (Fig. 1 and see Additional File 7),
indicating that most AIS genes were retained as duplicates
from 2R-WGD.
Our outgroup comparison analysis suggested the category
NS as the ancestral function of most AIS genes (Table 2),
as in a previous study [22]. Although suggested by several
previous studies [22-25], the apparent association
between the AIS and NS may have arisen simply because
the number of genes involved in the NS is larger than that
of genes involved in other systems. We therefore examined the relative enrichment of assigned categories among
AIS subfamilies as compared with the overall distribution
of these categories among all subfamilies. This analysis
revealed that the NS category was significantly over-represented as an ancestral function among AIS subfamilies,
supporting statistically the hypothesis [22] that AISrelated signaling genes were ancestrally involved in the
development and/or function of the NS in urbilaterians.
Our study did not address the specific evolutionary roles
of each round of 2R-WGD. Because of the unavailability
of the genome sequence of jawless vertebrates, which presumably diverged from jawed vertebrates before the sec-

ond round of 2R-WGD [26], it is difficult to differentiate
the effect of the first round of 2R-WGD in vertebrate
genomes from the second. It has recently been shown that
jawless vertebrates evolved their own AIS, which is different from the AIS of jawed vertebrates [27,28]. We anticipate that the ongoing genome project (Washington
University, St Louis, MO, USA) of a jawless vertebrate
(lamprey) will clarify the individual roles of each round of
2R-WGD in the evolution of the different AISs of these
organisms.
To date, studies using small-scale gene sets have hinted at
relationships between the AIS and 2R-WGD [2,10,22] and
between the AIS and NS [22-25]. Although such studies
are informative, they cannot yield conclusions that are
broadly applicable to the role of 2R-WGD. However, our
use of large-scale data sets (i.e., genomic sequence information, microarray-based expression data, and functional
annotation) enabled us to address these relationships in a
genome-wide fashion. In future research, integration of
other large-scale data sets (e.g., other types of data and
from additional species) into similar analyses will facilitate efforts to describe the evolution of the AIS precisely
and in detail and will help to further unravel the biologic
significance of 2R-WGD in that process.

Conclusion
The occurrence of 2R-WGD preceding emergence of the
AIS enhances our understanding of the biologic significance of WGD. Comprehensive identification of the paralogons in the human genome enabled us to conduct a
genomic mapping analysis to examine the relationship
between 2R-WGD and the evolution of many of the genes
involved in the AIS. This analysis revealed that numerous
pairs of signaling genes in the AIS (i.e., AIS genes) and
their paralogs were part of paralogons, indicating that the
genes were retained as duplicates from 2R-WGD.
The large-scale biologic data enabled us to examine the
statistical significance of enrichment of system-level function categories among the AIS subfamilies as compared
with the overall distribution of these categories among all
subfamilies. This examination revealed that the category
NS was significantly over-represented among AIS subfamilies, supporting statistically the hypothesis that the

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:218

AIS-related signaling genes were involved in the nervous
system of ancestral bilaterians. Our analysis uncovered
the evolutionary role of 2R-WGD in duplicating numerous signaling genes used in the ancestral NS and thereafter
in leading to the coordinated evolution of the resulting
duplicates to gain new functions in the AIS. We believe
that our findings provide a basis for further detailed
exploration of the diverse roles of 2R-WGD in the evolutionary success of the vertebrate lineage.

Methods
Data preparation
Protein-coding sequences for Homo sapiens (human; version 42.36d), Mus musculus (mouse; version 42.36c),
Oryzias latipes (medaka; version 44.1a), and Drosophila
melanogaster (fly; version 42.43) were obtained from the
Ensembl project website [29], and those for Ciona intestinalis came from the JGI website [30]. For genes with multiple transcripts, only the longest sequence was retrieved,
resulting in 15 852 Ciona, 24 125 mouse, 19 938 medaka,
13 545 Drosophila, and 22 102 human protein-coding
genes (total, 95 562 genes).
Clustering for detecting subfamilies of chordates
The objective of gene clustering was to reconstruct groups
of genes such that each included all of (and only) the
descendents of a single gene in the ancestral chordate. The
underlying assumption was that all of the vertebrate genes
in such a group were more similar to each other than to
their ortholog in Ciona, because they arose by either gene
duplication or lineage splitting after the urochordate-vertebrate divergence. We generated the translated protein
sequences for all genes, conducted all-to-all BLASTP analysis using the default parameters [31], and identified
reciprocal best-hit pairs between Ciona and vertebrate protein sequences (C and V, respectively). Such a pair recursively recruited other vertebrate sequences of which the
best hit in Ciona was C if they were more similar to each
other than C was to V; this constraint ensured that genes
with similarity due to duplication before the urochordatevertebrate divergence were allocated appropriately into
separate groups. The resulting groups of genes were
defined as subfamilies. We consequently generated 7109
subfamilies that included 39 407 (48%) of the 82 017
total chordate genes.
Phylogenetic analysis for subfamilies
For multiple sequence alignment of each subfamily,
MAFFT 5.852 [32] was run using the parameters: global
alignment option; model, BLOSUM62; maximal iteration, 1000. This alignment then was trimmed by eliminating all positions with gap characters. Only a multiple
alignment with a remaining length of at least 100 amino
acids was used for further analysis. Phylogenetic trees
were inferred by a maximum likelihood method as imple-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/218

mented in TREE-PUZZLE 5.2 [33] with the JTT model of
amino acid substitution [34] and a gamma distribution of
rates over eight rate categories; 10 000 puzzling steps were
used to assess reliability. Any trees with nodes that did not
bifurcate strictly were eliminated.
Paralogon detection and genomic mapping analysis
By using strictly bifurcating trees, we retrieved gene duplications that occurred before the divergence of fish and
tetrapods and identified 2774 paralogous pairs of genes in
humans. Paralogous pairs duplicated at the base of the
vertebrate branch were defined as BV paralogous pairs. A
paralogon was defined as two separate regions in the same
genome, each having one gene of each of two (or more)
BV paralogous pairs, with a maximum of 100 unduplicated genes between the two BV paralogous genes.
Through a sliding window analysis (for details, see [8]),
we comprehensively identified paralogons in the human
genome. For any paralogous gene pair P, we examined
whether the genomic map position of P was part of one of
the paralogons.
Clustering for detecting subfamilies of bilaterians
Although the general procedure was similar to the algorithm for detecting subfamilies of chordate genes, two
additional modifications were incorporated. First, we
used genes of flies instead of those of Ciona. Second, we
took account of paralogous genes in Drosophila that were
duplicated in the lineage leading to Drosophila. After clustering groups with complete gene sets of one invertebrate
(Drosophila) and three vertebrates in the same way as for
detecting subfamilies of chordate genes, we obtained singleton Drosophila sequences that were not included in any
subfamily. For any singleton Drosophila sequence S, if S
was more similar to the Drosophila sequence D in a subfamily than D was to any vertebrate sequences in the subfamily, then S was re-recruited into the subfamily.
Gene Ontology
GO terms [35] assigned to human genes were downloaded from the Ensembl project website [29] (Dec
2006). By mapping the GO terms into the more general
parent GO Slim terms (Generic GO Slim; obtained from
the website of the Gene Ontology consortium [36]), we
assigned GO Slim terms to each human gene. We focused
on the descendant terms of "biological process" (GO:
0008150).
Normalization of microarray expression data
Large-scale microarray expression data for 79 human tissues and organs were obtained from the GEO website
[37,38] (GEO accession ID: GDS596). We excluded
probes for control sequences and those with names that
carried the suffix_x_at; such probes do not uniquely complement the target sequence and hence are likely to cross-

hybridize. For resulting data, the arithmetic mean of the
two replicates in the microarray data was calculated. Next,
the data were normalized (Z-score normalization) according to sample to exclude differences associated with sample preparation, for example, and then further normalized
(Z-score normalization) according to probe to exclude
factors such as housekeeping genes, which are highly
expressed in all tissues and organs. If the Z-score of a gene
in a particular tissue or organ was greater than or equal to
2, we considered that the gene was expressed specifically
in that tissue or organ.
Listing the NS- and AIS-related functions of human genes
in the AIS subfamilies according to data in the literature
Information regarding the NS- and AIS-related functions
of human genes in the AIS subfamilies was assigned on
the basis of published literature (Dec 2006). Most of the
literature data supporting the functions of human genes
are based on analyses that have used their orthologs in
other vertebrate species (e.g., mouse, chicken, rat). The
assigned information regarding function reflected one of
two types of data. The first type of assigned information
was that concluded from phenotypical changes in experiments, including those involving gene mutation or knockout, overexpression or ectopic expression of wild-type or
mutant genes, antisense RNA or RNAi, specific protein
inhibitors, or gene interaction and rescue. However, for
precise assignment, experiments involving multiple members of a single subfamily (e.g., double knockout experiments) were not considered. The second type of
annotated information was that concluded from studies
addressing causes of diseases.
Assignment of system-level function categories to human
genes in the AIS subfamilies on the basis of microarray
data
System-level function categories were assigned to the
human genes in the subfamilies according to the following criterion: if, on the basis of microarray data (GEO
accession ID: GDS596), a gene is specifically expressed in
at least one of the tissues or organs represented in a system-level function category, then that system-level function category was assigned to the gene.
Assignment of system-level function categories to
Drosophila genes on the basis of FlyBase annotation
To assign system-level function categories to Drosophila
genes, we used allele phenotype data [18] that are manually curated with hierarchically structured controlled
vocabularies (CVs) in the FlyBase database [39]. The CV
term "nervous system" (FBbt:00005093) corresponded to
the system-level function category NS, that of "muscle system" (FBbt:00005069) corresponded to "muscle tissue",
and that of "circulatory system" (FBbt:00005057) corresponded to "blood." The CV terms "lamellocyte"

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/218

(FBbt:00001687), "crystal cell" (FBbt:00001690), and
"hemocyte" (FBbt:00005063) corresponded to the system-level function category "innate immunity." If a Drosophila gene in a subfamily was annotated with the CV
corresponding to a system-level function category or with
any of the descendents of the CV, then the corresponding
system-level function category was assigned to the gene.

Abbreviations
AIS: adaptive immune system; 2R-WGD: two rounds of
whole-genome duplication; GO: Gene Ontology; CV:
controlled vocabulary; NS: nervous system.
