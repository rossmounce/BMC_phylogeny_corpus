Abstract
Background: Inference of gene networks typically relies on measurements across a wide range of
conditions or treatments. Although one network structure is predicted, the relationship between
genes could vary across conditions. A comprehensive approach to infer general and conditiondependent gene networks was evaluated. This approach integrated Bayesian network and Gaussian
mixture models to describe continuous microarray gene expression measurements, and three gene
networks were predicted.
Results: The first reconstructions of a circadian rhythm pathway in honey bees and an adherens
junction pathway in mouse embryos were obtained. In addition, general and condition-specific gene
relationships, some unexpected, were detected in these two pathways and in a yeast cell-cycle
pathway. The mixture Bayesian network approach identified all (honey bee circadian rhythm and
mouse adherens junction pathways) or the vast majority (yeast cell-cycle pathway) of the gene
relationships reported in empirical studies. Findings across the three pathways and data sets
indicate that the mixture Bayesian network approach is well-suited to infer gene pathways based
on microarray data. Furthermore, the interpretation of model estimates provided a broader
understanding of the relationships between genes. The mixture models offered a comprehensive
description of the relationships among genes in complex biological processes or across a wide
range of conditions. The mixture parameter estimates and corresponding odds that the gene
network inferred for a sample pertained to each mixture component allowed the uncovering of
both general and condition-dependent gene relationships and patterns of expression.
Conclusion: This study demonstrated the two main benefits of learning gene pathways using
mixture Bayesian networks. First, the identification of the optimal number of mixture components
supported by the data offered a robust approach to infer gene relationships and estimate gene
expression profiles. Second, the classification of conditions and observations into groups that
support particular mixture components helped to uncover both gene relationships that are unique
or common across conditions. Results from the application of mixture Bayesian networks
substantially augmented the understanding of gene networks and demonstrated the added-value of
this methodology to infer gene networks.

Background
Relationships between genes and gene pathways can be
inferred based on gene expression profiles across conditions, treatments, or samples obtained from microarray
experiments [1-4]. Results from these studies can aid in
the confirmation of previously known pathways and
motivate the study of newly uncovered relationships
among genes. A Bayesian network approach is well-suited
to detect relationships between genes using an acyclic
direct graph [1,2,4]. Needham et al. provided an in depth
primer on learning Bayesian networks for computational
biology [5]. This approach has a solid theoretical foundation, offers a probabilistic framework to describe the variation typically observed in microarray data,
accommodates missing data, and incorporates prior
knowledge on gene relationships.
Several implementations of Bayesian networks to infer
gene networks have been reported [1-4,6,7] and two
potential weaknesses have been identified. First, some
applications require the transformation of continuous
gene expression data into discrete input data, and this can
influence the resulting network or resulting in loss of
information. Thus, analysis of data that has not been discretized is favored. Second, most Bayesian network implementations assume standard binomial, multinomial
probability or single Gaussian probability density functions of gene expression across a wide range of conditions.
These distributions may fail to accommodate multimodal
or skewed distributions associated with conditiondependent networks that exhibit changes in gene expression or gene relationships across conditions. This is
because gene network inference is typically based on gene
expression measurements across a wide range of conditions. Mixture models can be used to address this limitation because these models can describe potentially
complex distributions of gene expression across a wide
range of conditions. Newman and Leicht explored the
capability of probabilistic mixture models to detect a very
broad range of network structures without prior knowledge [8]. Ko et al. presented preliminary results from the
application of Bayesian mixture algorithm to infer pathways [9]. They presented a histone pathway, did not use
parameter estimates to identify condition-dependent gene
relationships, and did not use cross-validation to assess
the adequacy of the inferred network.
In this study, gene networks were inferred using a mixture
Bayesian network approach. The superiority of this
approach was evidenced on the new insights into general
and condition-dependent relationships between genes
and gene expression profiles gained while addressing
some of the limitations encountered in previous applications of Bayesian network to infer gene networks. We
demonstrate that the integration of mixture models and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/54

Bayesian network is well-suited to infer the structure of
gene networks from continuous gene expression measurements across a wide range of conditions. The estimated
parameters were easy to interpret, and aided in the characterization of gene expression and co-expression profiles.
Furthermore, functions of these parameter estimates
allowed the identification of condition-dependent networks. The mixture Bayesian network approach was used
to infer three pathways on three independent data sets.
The first prediction of the circadian rhythm pathway in
honey bees and the first prediction of a cell communication pathway (adherens junction) in mouse embryos were
obtained. In addition, the mixture Bayesian network
approach was applied to a yeast cell-cycle data set commonly used in many gene network studies.
Comparisons of the predicted and known pathways and
benchmark tests confirmed the outstanding performance
of the mixture Bayesian network approach. Novel insights
into general and condition-specific gene relationships and
expression patterns were obtained, thus demonstrating
the strength of the proposed approach to infer gene networks.

Methods
Mixture Bayesian Network Model
Bayesian networks can be described as a directed acyclic
graph with nodes representing random variables or genes
and directed edges representing the relationships between
the nodes [5,10]. Given a set of genes {g1, g2,..., gN}, the
corresponding Bayesian network G is represented as the
joint probability distribution over all genes in G or P(G).
Applying the narrow sense form of the Markov property
for a stochastic process, each gene is independent of nondescendant genes in the network, given the parent genes
or nodes. This conditional independence property allows
the factorization of the joint probability distribution as
the product of conditional probabilities. The overall network is conceived as a set of gene subnetworks, each corresponding to a given gene node gj and its associated
parent gene nodes a(gj) for j = 1 to N.

Models that accommodate for potential changes in gene
expression and co-expression patterns across conditions
are necessary when gene expression data across multiple
conditions is used to infer gene networks. Mixture models
are a flexible and effective option to describe changes in
gene co-expression patterns across conditions because the
joint probability functions of sub-networks are modeled
with a combination of mixture components. The concept
of integrating mixtures of Gaussian densities into Bayesian networks was introduced by Davies and Moore [11],
and applied to word and social networks by Newman and
Leicht [8]. Under the Bayesian network framework,

where N is the total number of genes (j = 1 to N) in the
network (or total number of sub-networks because each
gene specifies a sub-network) and a(gj) is the set of parent
genes of child gene gj in the j-th sub-network. The conditional probability density function of the j-th gene P(gj |
a(gj)), given the set of parent genes is expressed as the ratio
between the joint probability density function of the parent and child genes in the j-th sub-network (P(gj, a(gj))),
and the marginal probability density function of the parent genes in the j-th sub-network (P(a(gj))).
The joint and marginal probability density functions are
assumed to follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution
and a mixture model is used to describe possible sub-network structures. The probability density function (P) for
the j-th sub-network is represented with a mixture of Kj
multivariate Gaussian distributions (fjk) each with a
weight αjk. Here, xji denotes a pj dimensional vector
including the i-th expression observation (i = 1 to D where
D is the total number of gene expression observations) of
the child and parent genes in the j-th sub-network. For
example, if gj has three parents then pj = 4. Therefore, the
joint probability density function for the j-th sub-network
is

where

∑ α jk = 1 . For the joint probability density funck =1

An example of a Bayesian gene sub-network is provided in
Additional file 1. The relationship between the child and
parent genes in each sub-network can be described by the
weighted sum of the correlations between the parent
geneand child gene estimated for each mixture component. The weights correspond to the mixture component
weights. This computation was described by Bland and
Altman [12] and is presented in Additional file 1.
Overall Network Learning Algorithm
The learning algorithm integrated two major components, a) the inference of each individual gene sub-network structure and b) the inference of the overall network
structure. The first component consisted of the identification of the sub-network for each gene (i.e. the parent
genes of each child gene), the estimation of the parameters of the mixture models using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm [13,14], and the identification of the
number of components of the mixture model best supported by the data. The second component consisted of
the combination of the individual gene sub-networks into
an overall network (exploiting the conditional independence of the gene nodes given the parent gene nodes in the
Bayesian network framework), and the removal of cyclic
relationships between genes in the overall network.

A detailed description of the network structure learning
approach is presented in Additional file 2. The equations
in the Expectation-Maximization steps corresponding to a
gene sub-network follow the derivations of Bilmes [15]
and are summarized in Additional file 3. The Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC) was used to identify the mixture model best supported by the data (i.e. optimal
number of mixture components and associated parameter
estimates) for each gene sub-network, and to evaluate the
overall network [16]. Bayesian Information Criterion
offers a good compromise between model adequacy and
parsimony, minimizing the possibility of over-fitting the
data with highly parameterized networks. This feature of
the BIC is advantageous in gene network inference

because of the large number of relationships and conditions that could potentially be considered.
Newman and Leicht used probabilistic mixture models to
infer a wide range of network structures and noted that the
convergence of the algorithm to the global maxima is not
guaranteed [8]. To address this potential problem, we followed the approach implemented by Newman and
Leicht, and networks were inferred using a range of starting points for each mixture parameter [8]. Each network
presented in this study had the highest likelihood over all
sets of initial conditions or runs evaluated. Furthermore,
Davies and Moore demonstrated (based on ten-fold crossvalidation) the suitability of mixtures of Gaussian densities estimated with the EM algorithm to infer Bayesian
networks using data from an extensive astronomical survey and a high-throughput biological cell assay [11].
Extensive evaluation of the performance of the mixture
Bayesian network approach to infer networks was presented by Newman and Leicht and Davies and Moore
[8,11]. In this study, we concentrated on the application
of this methodology to infer gene networks using microarray data, and demonstrated how the interpretation of
parameter estimates and function thereof offered new
insights into the relationships between genes.
A unique advantage of the integration of the mixture
models and Bayesian network is the ability to uncover
general and condition-specific gene networks. The parameter estimates of each mixture component of a gene subnetwork were used as indicators of the gene expression
level (mean or μ), variation (variance or diagonals of Σ),
and co-variation between genes (co-variance or off-diagonals of Σ). In addition, the mixture parameter estimates
were used to compute the odds that the observation corresponded to a particular mixture component relative to
the other components. Each sample had a non-zero probability (albeit small in some mixtures and networks) to
pertain to each of the mixture components. For ease of
interpretation and to overcome the limitation of using a
single probability threshold across sub-networks with different number of mixture components, no threshold was
used to assign samples to mixtures. Instead, the samples
were assigned to the mixture component that had the
highest odds. The assignment of samples to the most
likely mixture component allowed the identification of
samples (i.e. conditions or treatments) that shared the
same expression and co-expression patterns for a gene
sub-network.
Data
Gene networks corresponding to three gene pathways (circadian rhythm, adherens junction, and cell cycle) were
inferred from three microarray gene expression data sets
(honey bee maturation, mouse embryo development, and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/54

yeast synchronization) using a mixture Bayesian network
approach. The goal of these applications was to gain
insights into general and condition-dependent relationships between genes and gene expression profiles, and
demonstrate the flexibility and adequacy of the mixture
Bayesian network approach to characterize networks.
Honey bee data set and circadian rhythm pathway
A detailed description of the honey bee microarray data
set is presented by Whitfield et al. and Rodriguez-Zas et al.
[17,18]. Briefly, gene expressions during behavioral maturation in the brains of honey bees (Apis mellifera or A. mellifera) from two subspecies (A. m. mellifera and A. m.
ligustica) rose in one of two host colonies (A. m. mellifera
and A. m. ligustica) representing two different environments were measured. Within combinations of bee and
host race (A. m. mellifera – A. m. mellifera or MM, A. m.
mellifera – A. m. ligustica or ML, A. m. ligustica – A. m. mellifera or LM, and A. m. ligustica – A. m. ligustica or LL),
nurse bees were sampled on days 0, 4, 8, 12 and 17 after
adult emergence (denoted h0, h1, h2, h3, and h4, respectively) and forager bees (denoted f4) were sampled at day
17 after emergence. The experimental design allowed the
division of the honey bee data set into four independent
bee-host subspecies-combination sub-data set (MM, ML,
LM, and LL). Thus, the gene network was inferred on the
complete data set and also on each of the four sub-data
set. Processing of the data from 108 spotted cDNA microarrays included background subtraction and log2-transformation of fluorescence intensities, and removal of
flagged spots or spots that did not surpass a minimum
intensity threshold of 200. The log2 intensity values were
normalized using a loess transformation, and global dye
and microarray effects were removed using the approach
implemented Beehive http://stagbeetle.animal.uiuc.edu/
Beehive/. Six genes assigned to the fruit fly circadian
rhythm pathway in the KEGG database http://
www.genome.jp/kegg/ were present on the microarray
platform. The KEGG identifier for the circadian rhythm
pathway in the fruit fly is dme04710 (accessed on August
2008).
Mouse embryo data set and adherens junction pathway
Data from nine microarray experiments that evaluated the
effect of multiple toxic agents on mouse (Mus musculus)
embryo gene expression levels were used to reconstruct
the adherens junction pathway. A detailed description of
this data set is provided by Rodriguez-Zas et al. [19].
Briefly, the experimental design consisted of two types of
direct comparisons with reverse labeling; comparisons
between samples that received different treatments (e.g.
ethanol, methylmercury, low oxygen, metabolic toxin 2chloro analogue of 2'-deoxyadenosine administered at
different time points or doses), and comparisons between
treated and control samples. A total of 90 microarrays

BMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:54

from the same platform were available for analysis, and
data processing and normalization followed the same
protocols applied to the honey bee data set [19] and
implemented in Beehive. Seven genes assigned to the
mouse adherens junction pathway in the KEGG database
were present on the microarray platform. The KEGG identifier for the adherens junction pathway in the mouse is
mmu04520 (accessed on August 2008).
Yeast synchronization data set and cell cycle pathway
The mixture Bayesian network approach was used to predict the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cell-cycle network
using gene expression data reported by [20]. The data set
consisted of gene expression measurements from 76
microarrays across six experiments. The yeast experiments
evaluated yeast cell synchronization via the arrest of cells
by one of four conditions, followed by activation or
release of the cells from the arresting condition. The synchronization conditions were cdc15-, cdc28-, α factorand size or elutrition- based synchronization, and samples were obtained at various time points after the
removal of the last four arresting conditions. In a separate
study, the effects of inducing either the G1 cyclin Cln3p
(Cln3) or the B-type cyclin Clb2p (Clb2) were examined,
each in two experiments. The normalized gene expression
data is available at the Stanford Microarray Database
http://genome-www5.stanford.edu and the experiment
identifiers are: 9837, 9838, 1666, 1674, 1679, 49 to 58,
634 and 2141. A network including 14 genes analyzed by
Friedman et al. using multinomial and single Gaussian
distribution was inferred and results were compared [2].
The KEGG identifier for the yeast cell cycle pathway is
sce04111 (accessed on August 2008).
Validation of the inferred gene networks
The relationships between genes inferred by the mixture
Bayesian network approach were compared to relationships reported in the KEGG database, BioGRID http://the
biogrid.org database, and Saccharomyces Genome database, or SGD http://db.yeastgenome.org, and in the literatures. These databases were accessed on August 2008 and
provide complementary information. The KEGG database
includes cause-effect or directional and non-directional
relationships between genes depicted in pathway diagrams. In directional relationships, the child and parent
genes are identified, meanwhile in non-directional relationships, genes are linked but there is neither a parent
(i.e. cause) nor a child (i.e. effect) gene. The BioGRID
database lists all known interactions or undirected relationships between genes. Due to differences in the curation and annotation protocols of each database, BioGRID
can encompass more relationships than KEGG, but these
relationships do not have associated direction.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/54

Two strategies were used to confirm the reliability of the
gene networks predicted by the mixture Bayesian network
approach. First, a k-fold cross-validation approach was
implemented. The design of the circadian rhythm experiment allowed to infer the gene network in each of four
independent data sets corresponding to the four bee-host
race combinations that encompassed the same five behavioral maturation stages or ages. Assessment of the mixture
Bayesian network approach consisted on the comparison
of the four inferred networks. Second, a permutationbased resampling approach was used to generate 400 randomized data sets with the same structure as the original
circadian rhythm data set. These data sets were analyzed
using the mixture Bayesian network approach and the predicted networks were compared to the observed network
and the known pathway in the database.
Not all genes present in the pathway databases had reporters in the microarray platforms studied and thus two types
of gene relationships, direct and indirect (not to be confused with directional and non-directional) were inferred.
Direct relationships were detected between gene nodes
that were present in the microarray platform and directly
linked on the pathway database used to evaluate the
results (e.g. KEGG). Indirect relationships were detected
when the database indicated relationships between genes
that were related through intermediate genes not present
on the microarray platform.
The adequacy of the approach was demonstrated in the
three independent data sets using a bilateral strategy. First,
our approach encompasses a wide range of network models, from no relationships between genes and single Gaussian distributions to networks with variable number of
relationships across sub-networks and mixtures of multiple Gaussian distributions. Our approach identified the
gene relationships and number of mixture components
best supported by the data for each sub-network, accounting for model complexity and data available using the BIC
score. Multiple mixture components were favored over
single components in the vast majority of the sub-networks inferred in the three data sets studied suggesting
that adequacy of our approach to describe gene networks.
Second, the inferred networks were compared to known
network and the vast majority of the relationships were
confirmed.

Results and discussion
Honey bee data set and circadian rhythm pathway
The mixture Bayesian network approach provided the first
published description of the relationship between genes
in the circadian rhythm pathway of honey bees. In addition, this approach offered novel information on general
and condition-specific gene relationships. Figure 1 summarizes the circadian rhythm gene network predicted by

the mixture Bayesian network approach on each of the
four bee-host sub-data sets used for cross-validation. Solid
and dash-dotted arrows (edges) denote direct and indirect
relationships, respectively, confirmed in the circadian
rhythm pathway for the fruit fly in the KEGG database.
The number beside each edge denotes the fraction of data
sets that supports that edge. For example, 4/4 denotes that
the gene relationship was detected on all four sub-data
sets.
All direct and indirect relationships detected by the mixture Bayesian network on the honey bee genes were consistent with the relationships depicted for the fruit fly
circadian rhythm pathway on the KEGG database. In
addition, there were no predicted relationships that were
not present on the KEGG fruit fly pathway. Previous
reports indicated that maturation age was the highest
source of differentially expressed genes in the honey bee
microarray study under consideration, followed by the
subspecies of the bee sampled and the species of the host
colony [17,18]. In agreement with these studies, the mixture Bayesian network consistently detected most edges of
the circadian rhythm pathway across multiple bee-host

sub-data sets (edge ratios 4/4 or 3/4). However, not all
relationships were detected in all four sub-data sets.
Four edges were only detected on half of the sub-data sets
(edge ratio 2/4), and one edge was only detected on one
sub-data set (edge ratio 1/4). The inability to consistently
predict the same edges on all four sub-data sets may be
due to two reasons. First, previous work noted that the
subspecies of the honey bee sampled was another source
of differentially expressed genes, albeit less important than
maturation [17,18]. Differences on edge prediction
among sub-data sets may be due to differences in the
honey bee subspecies used in each sub-data set. Second,
the size of each bee-host sub-data set may have resulted in
insufficient information to predict some edges in some
sub-data sets. To test this hypothesis, the mixture Bayesian
network approach was applied to the complete data set.
All the edges depicted in Figure 1 were also predicted on
the complete data set. This result suggests that most or all
data sets contained consistent information on the edges,
although the information within data set may have not
permitted an accurate prediction of some edges. Alternatively, these gene relationships were present on one or two

sub-data sets, but the strength of the relationship on these
sub-data sets was sufficient to be detected across all four
sub-data sets. All the edges in Figure 1 were also inferred
when the complete honey bee data set was analyzed and
thus, results based on the complete honey bee data set are
discussed.

The reliability of the gene network predicted by the mixture Bayesian network approach was assessed using permutation-based resampling. Of the networks predicted
from the randomized data sets, 15% and 24% did not
share any or only shared one relationship with the network inferred from the original data and confirmed
against the KEGG database, respectively. The maximum
number of gene relationships in common between the
randomized and original data sets was five. Only 1% and
7% of the networks predicted from the randomized data
sets shared five and four relationships out of the 14 gene
relationships with the network originally inferred, respectively. Similarly, 32% of the networks predicted from randomized data sets had more than eight false positive
relationships and only 5% of networks had four or less
false positives relationships. The hegemony of these findings further advocates the capability of the mixture Bayesian network approach to uncover evidence on gene
relationships contained in the data and minimize the
probability of networks predicted by chance alone.
The insights into condition-dependent gene relationships
offered by the mixture Bayesian network were evident on
the sub-network of gene Cyc, including parent genes Per,
Dbt, and Vri. Using the complete honey bee data set, the
Cyc sub-network was best described by a mixture of two
components. The parameter estimates corresponding to
each mixture component of a gene sub-network offered
information on the expression and co-expression patterns. Mixture components 1 and 2 had weights equal to
0.35 and 0.65, respectively. The most notable differences
between the two mixture components were the level of
gene Cyc (double in mixture component 2 relative to mixture component 1) and the correlations between gene Cyc
and parent genes Vri and Sgg. The correlations of Cyc with
both parent genes were negative in mixture component 1
and positive in mixture component 2 and the difference
between the correlations of both mixture components
was significant at P-value < 0.04 and < 1.2 × 10-10 for Cyc
and Vri and Cyc and Sgg, respectively [21].
Table 1 summarizes the assignment of samples from six
maturation ages (h0, h1, h2, h3, h4, and f4) and four beehost combinations (LL, LM, ML, and MM) to each of the
two mixture components (Mix1 and Mix2) for the Cyc
gene sub-network. Due to the experimental design, the
number of samples differed across bee-host-age combinations [17]. The Cyc sub-network was better described by

mixture component one (Mix1) for most A. m. ligustica
bees raised on A. m. ligustica hives (LL), meanwhile mixture component two (Mix2) better described the sub-network for A. m. mellifera bees raised on A. m. mellifera hives
(MM). Their results are consistent with differences in
expression across bee subspecies reported by Whitfield et
al. [17]. In addition, the mixture component one description of the Cyc sub-network was preferred for one-day old
nurse (h0) and forager (f4) bees, meanwhile mixture
component two was favored for four, eight, and twelveday old nurse (h1, h2, and h3, respectively) bees. This
result is consistent with Whitfield et al. who concluded
that many changes in gene expression across maturation
ages occurred by day eight [17]. Rodriguez-Zas et al. also
reported a major difference in the gene expression profiles
of LL and LM bees at the eight and twelve-day maturation
ages [18].
The mixture Bayesian network approach was able to identify different models (or mixture components) of association between genes and of gene expression profiles
depending on the conditions under consideration, and
also provided a general model that is the weighted average
of the condition-specific components. Cyran et al. noted
that the fruit fly circadian clock encompasses two interlocked transcriptional feedback loops [22]. In one loop,
dClock/Cyc activates the expression of Per, and the Per protein in turn inhibits the activity of dClock/Cyc. In addition,
Vri and Pdp1 encode related transcription factors whose
expressions are directly activated by dClock/Cyc. In the second loop, the Vri and Pdp1 proteins feed back and directly
regulate the expression of dClock. Results from the mixture
Bayesian network approach (Figure 1 and Table 1) confirm these findings.

The identification and interpretation of general and condition-dependent gene co-regulation patterns, using the
odds that observations pertain to each mixture component, and the mixture component parameter estimates
presented for the gene Cyc sub-network can be repeated
for all other genes in the network. Although the optimal
number of mixture components varied across gene subnetworks (in most cases a mixture of two or three components was estimated), similar general and conditiondependent conclusions were obtained for other gene subnetworks in the circadian rhythm pathway and thus are
not presented here. This situation may be due to the high
degree of interconnectedness among the gene nodes in
this network. For networks encompassing less related subnetworks, parameter estimates from each sub-network
module should be evaluated.
Rubin et al. postulated, based on phylogenetic and correlation analyses of the function and domains of two proteins (Cry and Tim), that the circadian rhythm pathway of
the honey bees resembles more the mammalian than the
fruit fly counterpart [23]. The similarity between the
honey bee and fruit fly circadian rhythm networks found
in the present study may be due to absence of reporters
associated with genes that differ across insect species, such
as the genes considered by Rubin et al., on the microarray
study under consideration [23].
Several indirect relationships among genes reported in the
fruit fly KEGG pathway were predicted as direct ones due
to the absence of microarray reporters corresponding to
the intermediate genes. Although the identification of
relationships (direct or indirect) among genes constitutes
a major step towards a comprehensive description of biological pathways, precise characterization of the relationships is also important. Differences between the predicted
and reported (e.g. literature, databases) gene relationships
may be due to differences among the experiments considered (e.g. honey bee versus fruit fly) and insufficient or
inaccurate information (e.g. small experiment, limited
microarray platform). Additional studies are necessary to
ascertain the true nature (direct or indirect) of these gene
relationships.
Mouse embryo data set and adherens junction pathway
Yokoyama et al. studied the relationship among various
proteins in the adherens junction pathway [24]. Using the
mixture Bayesian network approach, the first depiction of
general and condition-specific gene profiles and interactions in the adherens junction pathway of mouse embryos
was obtained. Figure 2 depicts the adherens junction gene
network predicted by the mixture Bayesian network
approach.

Comparison of the predicted and expected relationships between genes pertaining to the adherens junction pathway based on mouse embryo microarray
data. Solid lines and arrows (edges) denote direct relationships predicted and confirmed in the mouse KEGG pathway.
Dashed lines and arrows represent indirect relationships
predicted and confirmed in the KEGG pathway. Arrows
denote directional relationships reported in the KEGG pathway. Lines denote non-directional relationships reported in
the KEGG pathway. Genes: RhoA = ras homolog gene family,
member A; Afadin = mixed lineage-leukemia translocation to
4 homolog; Actin = Actb; α-Catenin = Ctnna1; Zo-1 = tight
junction protein 1; α-Actinin = Actn1; Vinculin = Vcl.

This approach predicted directional relationships in
which the parent and child gene nodes are identified.
However, the adherens-junction mouse pathway in the
KEGG database included some non-directional gene relationships. Because the inferred network was validated
against the KEGG pathway, non-directional gene relationships are denoted with lines instead of arrows. All direct
and indirect relationships between genes predicted by the
mixture Bayesian network approach were present in the
KEGG database. Consistency between the predicted and
reported adherens junction networks was also observed
for two additional pathways (actin cytoskeleton and axon
guidance) predicted using the same mouse microarray
data set [19,25].
The parameter estimates and odds that observations pertained to different mixture model components enhanced
the understanding of the differences in gene profiles and
relationships between mouse embryo treatments. For
example, a mixture of three components was best suited
to describe the sub-network of gene α-Actinin. Mixture
components one, two and three had weights 0.28, 0.57
and 0.16 and modeled low, intermediate and high levels
of expression of all genes in the α-Actinin sub-network,
respectively. In addition, gene α-Actinin had a negative

correlation with parent gene Actin in the first mixture
component meanwhile this correlation was positive in the
other two mixture components. The statistical significance
of the difference between correlations from mixture components one and two, and one and three were P-value <
8.6 × 10-10 and P-value < 1.1 × 10-11, respectively meanwhile the correlations from mixture components two and
three were non-significantly different (P-value > 0.25).
Table 2 summarizes the assignment of observations
within conditions (mouse embryo studies or series and
treatments) to each of the two components (Mix1 and
Mix2) of a mixture model describing the gene Actin subnetwork. All or the majority of the observations within a
series (or study) were assigned to a single mixture component. For example, all the observations within series GSE
1068, 1070, 1075, 1076, and 1079 were assigned to one
mixture component. In addition, all observations except
one were assigned to the same mixture component in
series GSE 1069 and 1077. Detailed description of the difference between conditions within study is provided in
Rodriguez-Zas et al. [19]. Briefly, most studies evaluated
different dosages, dosage timing, or combination of
agents that influence embryo development. The results
from the mixture Bayesian network approach suggested
that most of the variations in conditions within study had
a minor effect on the relationship between genes in the
Actin sub-network relative to the effect of study. In general, for other gene subnetworks the distribution of the
observation assignments to mixture components was in
agreement with the results from the Actin sub-network.

The conditions with the most extreme distribution of
observations were consistently found across gene subnetworks.
Consideration of the assignment of treatment observations, regardless of study, to the mixture components for
the Actin sub-network revealed new and confirmed
known biological interpretations (Table 2). For example,
the only three conditions receiving 2-chloro-2'deoxyadenosine or CdA that were assigned to the mixture component Mix2 correspond to sampling intervals before (three
hours) and after (six hours) the critical event of p53 protein induction expressed in cda-treated embryos between
3.0- and 4.5 h post-exposure (GSE 1069) and to embryos
also treated with Ro5-4864 (denoted Ro), a presumed
agonist that is weakly teratogenic (GSE 1072). All the
observations during the critical event (4.5 hours) were
assigned to Mix1. These results suggested that sampling
time and treatments in addition to cda could have substantial impact on the Actin sub-network.
The odds that observations pertain to each mixture component also provided insights into the effects of two pharmacologic agents, PK11195 (denoted PK) and Ro5-4864
(Table 2). The PK agent can rescue embryos from the
effects of toxic agents meanwhile Ro is a presumed agonist
that can have weak teratogenic effects. The fairly even
assignment of PK and Ro treatments to both mixture components suggested that the impact of these treatments on
the Actin sub-network was dependent on the other conditions of the experiments. Similarly, the evaluation of the
assignment of control (or untreated) samples to mixture
components offered information on the behavior of
seemingly similar samples. Out of ten control samples
(cnt), seven were better described using Mix2. Among the
three control samples assigned to Mix1, one corresponded
to the mouse sub-strain C57BL/6J (B6J) and was consistent with the assignment of all other B6J samples that
received treatment to Mix1. This finding suggested the
potentially high effect of the genotype of the embryo on
the relationship among genes in the Actin sub-network.
The other two control samples assigned to Mix1 corresponded to series GSE 1069 and 1072, and these assignments were consistent with the assignment of all (GSE
1069) or the vast majority (GSE 1072) of the samples to
Mix1. These assignments are consistent with the strong
series effect previously discussed.

man et al. [2]. The predicted gene relationships with
known direction are denoted with arrows. The only two
directional gene relationships reported in the KEGG database are CDC5 → CLB1 and CDC5 → CLB2. The remaining gene relationships could only be confirmed in
databases that list undirected relationships (BioGRID,
SGD) and thus these relationships are depicted with lines
instead of arrows. In Figure 3, the direct relationships confirmed in BioGRID, Friedman et al., KEGG, literature and
SGD are denoted with solid lines and labeled with the letters B, F, K, L and S, respectively, meanwhile the indirect
relationships are denoted with dashed lines.
Of the 21 gene relationships predicted by the mixture
Bayesian approach, nine were confirmed in Friedman et
al., seven and three were listed in the BioGRID and KEGG
databases respectively, and three and one were reported in
the literature [26,27] and SGD database, respectively. Sev-

eral direct relationsh ips predicted by the mixture Bayesian network approach were not reported in the BioGRID,
KEGG, literature, SGD databases or in Friedman et al. [2].
Likewise, only three out of the 13 directed relationships
and four out of the 14 genes in the pathway predicted by
Friedman et al. are present in the KEGG pathway [2].
Although experimental studies are necessary to confirm or
disprove these findings, additional gene relationships and
literature review imply that some are likely to be true
(direct or indirect) relationships. For example, through
text mining of biomedical literature, Liu et al. found that
genes MNN1, CLN1, and CLN2 were all influenced by the
same activators [28]. This finding supports the novel relationships between MNN1 and either CLN1 or CLN2
detected by the mixture Bayesian network approach. Had
microarray data on the common activators been available,
the relationship between these genes could have been further resolved. Additional studies are necessary to deter-

mine if the unconfirmed relationships are true positives
instead of false positives. The mixture Bayesian network
approach was not able to detect relationships between
genes SVS1 and ALK1 and the rest of the genes in the network. These results are consistent with the absence of evidence relating genes SVS1 and ALK1 in the literature or
databases.
Assessment of the mixture model parameter estimates was
used to gain insights into the gene sub-networks. For
example, a mixture model with two components receiving
equal weight was found to describe the sub-network of
gene CDC5 depicted in Figure 3. The mean expression of
the genes in mixture component one was between a half
and a third of the mean expression of the genes in mixture
component two. In addition, genes CDC5 and CLB1 had
a positive correlation (0.36) in mixture component two,
meanwhile the correlation was weaker and negative (0.17) in mixture component one and these correlations
were different at P-value < 0.001).
The assignment of the samples to the components of the
mixture model describing gene sub-networks helped in
the understanding of the changes in the network across
the different treatments or conditions studied. For example, consideration of the probability that a sample pertained to either one of the two components of the mixture
model used to describe the sub-network of gene CDC5
confirmed some expected assignments and suggested
unexpected commonalities between samples. The assignment of elutrition samples collected every 30 minutes to
mixture components provided a good example of a slow
transition of the network behavior across time. The first
six samples collected between 0 and 150 minutes were
assigned to one mixture component and six samples
obtained from 240 to 390 minutes were assigned to the
other mixture component. Samples collected at intermediate time points (between 180 and 210 minutes) had a
similar odds ratio to pertain to either mixture component.
A discussion of the assignment of samples in the α-factor,
cdc28 and cdc15 synchronization is provided in Additional file 4.
Overall, the mixture Bayesian network approach detected
more confirmed relationships than the approach presented by Friedman et al. [2]. However, Friedman et al.
detected five relationships (CLN2:SVS1, CLN2:RNR3,
SVS1:MNN1, CDC5:SVS1, CDC5:ALK1) that were not predicted by the mixture Bayesian approach and were not
present in the BioGRID database. The higher number of
relationships predicted by the mixture Bayesian network
approach relative to the Bayesian network implementations of Friedman et al. may be due to the flexibility of the
mixture model in the mixture Bayesian network approach

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/54

to accommodate fluctuations on the gene patterns and
relationships across the multiple conditions evaluated [2].
Single, fixed-number, and optimal mixture densities
The mixture Bayesian network approach to infer gene networks implemented in this study used the EM algorithm
to obtain parameter estimates and the BIC score to identify the optimal number of mixture components supported by the data. This framework offered great flexibility
to accommodate a wide range of models and probability
density functions across gene sub-networks and within
gene sub-network, across the conditions under study. A
series of benchmarking tests were conducted to evaluate
the benefits of the more flexible and data-driven mixture
Bayesian network approach for different scenarios.

The description of the sub-networks supported by the data
based on BIC score favored mixture over single distributions. This indicates that for the networks and data sets
considered in our study, mixtures offer a better description of the relationship between genes than single distributions. This result was further validated when the
assignment of samples from different treatments or conditions to mixture components was investigated. The
robustness of the mixture Bayesian network learning process granted by the use of mixture distributions and potentially variable numbers of mixture components across the
network was investigated. Figure 4 presents the BIC scores
of the networks predicted using the mixture Bayesian network approach with the number of mixture components
fixed to single or mixture of two or three Gaussian densities (Fixed1, Fixed2, and Fixed3 respectively), or estimated
from the data (Optimal Mixture) for the circadian rhythm
and adherens junction networks previously presented.
The BIC score of the Optimal Mixture implementation
was higher than the approaches that used a fixed number
of mixtures across all subnetworks. The superiority of the
mixture Bayesian network approach that estimates the
optimal number of mixture components for each gene
sub-network from the data over approaches with fixed
number of components was evident in both networks. In
addition, the maximum number of parents in a gene subnetwork was set to five in this study, based on a review of
pathways reported in the KEGG database and associated
to the pathways studied. This maximum was supported by
the fact that the optimal BIC score was always found with
one to four parent genes.
Computational evaluation
The computational time required for the prediction of a
network across a wide range of number of genes was evaluated. The mixture Bayesian network approach was
implemented using the C++ programming language. Figure 5 shows the computational time (in CPU seconds
using a AMD Opteron 248 2.2 GHz processor, after the

microarray data was read) required to reconstruct networks of different size, ranging from five to 25 genes sampled at random from the circadian rhythm (CR) and
adherens junction (AJ) microarray data sets. Five data sets
were obtained from the complete microarray data sets for
each network size considered, and a network was estimated for each data set and network size. The computing
time to predict a network depends in part on the degree of
connectivity between the genes studied. Because the gene
sets were drawn at random from the microarray data sets,
the degree of relationship between these genes (number
of edges) was expected to vary across data sets within network size and across network sizes studied. Thus, both the
number of edges predicted in each network and the computational time required to predict the network were
recorded. Figure 5 and Figure 6 present the average computational time and number of edges across the five data
sets within network size evaluated for two cases, when the
number of mixture components was estimated from the
data (opt) or fixed at 3 components (fix). These comparisons allowed the assessment of the impact of the mixture
component of the algorithm on the computational time
and inferred edges.

As expected, the higher the number of genes in the network, the higher the computational time required for estimation of the complete network (Figure 5). The lower
computational time to infer the adherens junction network compared to the circadian rhythm network may be
due to the fewer relationships (edges) detected in the first
network (Figure 6). In the adherens junction network, the
trends of computational time and number of edges across
number of genes were similar. In the circadian rhythm
network, the computing time increased at a slightly or
moderately higher rate than the number of edges across
the number of genes. The disparity between the trends of
time and number of edges was higher in the adherens
junction network with a fixed number of mixture components than when the number of components was estimated from the data. This result may be due to the
potential inadequacy of the fixed number of mixture components to describe some or all gene sub-networks. Thus,
more iterations and more time were required to estimate
the model parameters and infer the network structure.
Furthermore, the nearly constant number of edges (ranging from four to eight) inferred in the adherens junction
across the number of gene nodes studied (ranging from

five to 25) suggested that the mixture Bayesian network
algorithm was not biased towards inferring higher
number of edges with higher number of gene nodes network (Figure 6).
Algorithmic extensions
The identification of a Bayesian network structure is an
NP-hard problem because the number of possible candidate structures super-exponentially increases with the
number of gene nodes. Two structure learning methods
that have complementary advantages were evaluated in
this study, the sparse candidate algorithm [1] and the simulated annealing method [29]. The sparse candidate algorithm achieves fast structure learning by restricting the
search space of potential parent gene nodes. Intuitively we
would like to restrict the search space as less as possible.
In this study, the algorithm was modified to minimize the
impact of restricting the search space, while also maintaining efficiency by evaluating additional parent genes
for each gene sub-network with less than the maximum
number of parent genes.

The network structure was also inferred using a simulated
annealing algorithm to overcome the potential risk of
inferring networks at local maxima instead of global maximum [30]. At each iteration, the simulated annealing
algorithm randomly jumped from the current network
topology to a nearby topology formed from the addition,
deletion, or reversion of an edge in the current topology.
Simulated annealing can escape from potential local
minima by occasionally sampling from less suitable networks and the probability of jumping to another status is
empirically adjusted. This procedure is repeated until convergence. The implementation of these two algorithms
allowed the evaluation of the mixture Bayesian network
approach to be independent of the actual algorithm used
to learn the topology of the network. The vast majority of
the gene relationships was predicted by both the sparse
candidate and simulated annealing algorithms. Therefore,
only results from the sparse candidate algorithm are presented here.
The mixture Bayesian approach presented here can be
extended to include other gene (or variable) selection criteria, consider other distributional assumptions and prior
information on the relationship between genes in a network. These extensions are discussed in Additional file 5.

Conclusion
A comprehensive characterization of the circadian rhythm
pathway in honey bees and of the adherens junction pathway in mouse embryos was obtained using a mixture
Bayesian network approach. All the gene relationships
detected by the mixture Bayesian network based on honey
bee gene expression information were consistent with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/54

known relationships in the fruit fly circadian rhythm
pathway. The mixture Bayesian network approach was
also able to uncover changes in gene relationships and
profiles in the Cyc gene sub-network associated with
changes on the maturation age, subspecies of honey bee
sampled, and subspecies of honey bees in the host hive.
Likewise, all the gene relationships detected by the mixture Bayesian network using mouse-embryo gene expression information were consistent with known
relationships in the general mouse adherens junction
pathway. All or the vast majority of the samples within
experiment were assigned to the same mixture component model in seven out of the nine experiments considered. This assignment of samples to mixture components
suggested that experiment had a major impact on the gene
relationships and expression profiles in the Actin gene
sub-network. The application of the mixture Bayesian network approach to the well-studied yeast cell cycle confirmed many reported relationships. In addition, the
assignment of samples to the components of the mixture
model for the CDC5 gene sub-network provided novel
insights into gene associations. For example, the assignment of elutrition samples to the mixture components
suggested a slow transition of the network behavior across
time. On the other hand, the assignment of cdc15-synchronized samples to mixture components suggested that
the networks were instable across most of the time-points
considered.
This study demonstrated that the mixture Bayesian network approach is well-suited to infer gene pathways based
on microarray gene expression data. The estimation of the
number of mixture components from the data allowed
the simultaneous modeling of gene sub-networks with
either constant or variable behavior across conditions.
This modeling approach has two potential advantages, a)
it can increase the accuracy of the inferred relationships
and precision of the parameter estimates, and b) it can
help identify groups or clusters of observations that support particular (condition-dependent) models or mixture
components. The superior accuracy of the mixture Bayesian network approach was demonstrated by the better
BIC score of the network with the number of mixture
components estimated from the data, compared to the
BIC score of approaches with a fixed number of mixture
components. The mixture of Gaussian distributions demonstrated in this study naturally accommodated the continuous and typically normally-distributed gene
expression measurements. The proposed approach can be
extended to use mixtures of other discrete or continuous
distributions, or incorporate prior information on the
genes in the network.
The proposed mixture Bayesian network approach allows
the detection of general and condition-specific relation-

ships among genes, and the prediction of an overall network structure within the framework of probabilistic
inference. The interpretation of parameter estimates and
functions (e.g. probabilities and odds to pertain to a mixture component) can offer a more comprehensive understanding of gene patterns and relationships. Insights into
the gene patterns, and the relationships between them,
can be used to design effective follow-up experiments and
investigate the novel relationships predicted by the mixture Bayesian network approach.
