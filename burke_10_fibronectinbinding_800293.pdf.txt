Abstract
Background: Fibronectin binding proteins A and B (FnBPA and FnBPB) mediate adhesion of S. aureus to fibrinogen,
elastin and fibronectin. We previously identified seven different isotypes of FnBPA based on divergence in the
fibrinogen- and elastin-binding A domains. The variation created differences in antigenicity while ligand binding
functions were retained. Here, FnBPB variation was examined in both human and bovine isolates and compared to that
of FnBPA.
Results: Seven different fnbB allelic variants were identified. Some strains that cluster by phylogenetic analysis contain
different fnbB variants, whereas more divergent strains contain the same fnbB variant. The phylogeny of fnbB alleles
does not match the phylogeny of fnbA alleles. Some FnBPA and FnBPB isotypes that are specified by human S. aureus
strains are also found in bovine strains. The seven fnbB allelic variants encode seven distinct isotypes of the FnBPB A
domain that are 61 to 85% identical in amino acid sequence. Variant amino acid residues were mapped on a threedimensional model of the FnBPB A domain and were predicted to be surface-exposed. They are responsible for the
antigenic diversity detected with polyclonal antibody and a monoclonal antibody raised against isotype I. Ligand
binding by recombinant FnBPB N23 isotypes was compared by ELISA-based solid phase assays and surface plasmon
resonance. Each bound to immobilized fibrinogen, elastin and fibronectin dose-dependently and saturably with similar
affinities. Binding to fibronectin was surprising because the A domains do not contain any known motifs that mediate
binding to fibronectin. This raises the possibility that the A domain of FnBPB contains a novel fibronectin binding motif
that binds fibronectin by a novel mechanism.
Conclusions: Seven different isoforms of FnBPB A domain retain ligand-binding functions but are antigenically
distinct. The variation in FnBPA and FnBPB occurs in human and bovine S. aureus strains and may act as an immune
evasion mechanism. All seven isotypes of FnBPB are capable of binding fibronectin though none contain any known
fibronectin-binding motifs. These results have implications for the development of vaccines or immunotherapeutics
that target FnBPB
Background
Staphylococcus aureus is a commensal that colonizes the
moist squamous epithelium of the human anterior nares.
Twenty percent of the population are permanently colonised while the remainder are colonized intermittently
[1]. It is an important opportunistic pathogen that can
cause superficial skin infections as well as invasive lifethreatening conditions such as septic arthritis and endocarditis [2]. The success of S. aureus as a pathogen can in
part be attributed to the expression of cell surface protein

receptors designated MSCRAMMs (microbial surface
components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules) that
interact specifically with proteins present in the host
plasma and extracellular matrix [3]. MSCRAMMs act as
virulence factors that allow S. aureus to adhere to the surface of host cells and to damaged tissue and help it to
avoid phagocytosis by neutrophils [4-6]
The fibronectin binding proteins (FnBPs) A and B of S.
aureus are multifunctional MSCRAMMs which recognise fibronectin, fibrinogen and elastin [7-10]. FnBPA and
FnBPB have considerable organization and sequence similarity and are composed of a number of distinct domains
[7,9]. Figure 1 illustrates the domain organization of
FnBPA and FnBPB of S. aureus strain 8325-4. Both pro-

Figure 1 Structural organisation of FnBPA and FnBPB from S.aureus 8325-4. The N-terminus of FnBPA and FnBPB contain a signal sequence (S) followed by a fibrinogen and elastin binding A domain
consisting of subdomains N1, N2 and N3. Following the A domains are
tandemly repeated fibronectin-binding motifs. The A domains as they
were originally defined contain a single fibronectin-binding motif. The
true A domains of FnBPA and FnBPB are now considered to include
residues 37- 511 and residues 37-480, respectively. At the C-termini are
proline-rich repeats (PRR), wall (W) and membrane (M)-spanning domains, and the sortase recognition motif LPETG. The percentage amino acid identities between the binding domains of FnBPA and FnBPB
from S.aureus 8325-4 are shown.

teins contain a secretory signal sequence at the N-terminus and a C-terminal LPETG motif required for sortasemediated anchoring of the proteins to the cell wall peptidoglycan. The N-terminal A domains of FnBPA and
FnBPB are exposed on the cell surface and promote binding to fibrinogen and elastin [10,11]. Based on their
sequence similarity to the fibrinogen binding A domain
of clumping factor A (ClfA) [12], the A domains of FnBPA
and FnBPB are predicted to fold into three sub-domains
N1, N2 and N3 similar to ClfA [13]. The A domains of
FnBPA, FnBPB and ClfA bind fibrinogen at the C-terminus of the γ-chain [10,14]. Unlike ClfA, the A domains of
FnBPA and FnBPB also bind to elastin [8]. It is proposed
that ligand binding occurs through the same dynamic
"dock, lock, latch" mechanism that has been predicted for
fibrinogen binding to the A domain of ClfA [13]. The
fibrinogen γ-chain peptide binds to a groove located
between domains N2 and N3 in the apo form. C-terminal
residues in domain N3 undergo a conformational change
to bind adjacent to a β-strand in domain N2 forming an
extra β-strand termed the latching peptide. This traps the
fibrinogen peptide in the groove between N2 and N3 and
locks it in place [15].
Located distal to the A domains of FnBPA and FnBPB
are unfolded regions which contain multiple, tandemly
arranged motifs (Figure 1) that bind to the N-terminal
type I modules of fibronectin by a tandem beta-zipper
mechanism [16]. The sequences of the fibronectin-binding motifs are highly conserved in FnBPA and FnBPB
from strain 8325-4 (95% amino acid identity). By contrast
the sequences of the fibrinogen and elastin binding A
domains are more divergent (45% amino acid identity).

Most research on fibronectin-binding proteins has
been preformed with FnBPA from strain 8325-4. It was
reported previously that the A domain of FnBPA of S.
aureus strain 8325-4 comprising residues 37-544 bound
to immobilized elastin and to fibrinogen (Figure 1.)
[8,10]. The A domain co-ordinates were revised recently
and it was noted that the C- terminus of rFnBPA37-544
likely contained a single fibronectin-binding motif [16].
The ability of this protein to bind fibronectin was later
confirmed [11]. In the same study, the revised A domain
of FnBPA spanning residues 194-511 (Figure 1) was
shown bind fibrinogen and elastin but not fibronectin.
The minimum region of the FnBPA A domain needed for
binding to fibrinogen and elastin is subdomains N23 (residues 194-511). The N1 sub-domain is not required for
ligand binding [11].
The binding of FnBPs to fibronectin promotes the
internalization of S. aureus into epithelial and endothelial
cells which are not normally phagocytic [17,18]. FnBPmediated invasion occurs through the formation of a
fibronectin bridge between S. aureus and the α5β1 integrin [18]. This may promote bacterial dissemination from
the bloodstream to internal organs and evasion of
immune responses and antibiotics. This was convincingly
demonstrated in a study of the role of FnBPA in experimental endocarditis where binding to both fibrinogen
and fibronectin required. Binding of fibrinogen was
required for initial colonization of thrombi on damaged
valves and while binding to fibronectin was required for
the infection to spread [19].
FnBPA and FnBPB are encoded by two closely linked
but separately transcribed genes, fnbA and fnbB [7,9].
While most strains contain both genes, some strains contain only fnbA [20]. In strain 8325-4, studies with sitespecific fnbA and fnbB insertion mutants showed that
either FnBPA or FnBPB mediated adherence to immobilized fibronectin but there was no significant difference in
adherence between wild type strains and single fnb
mutants [21]. However, studies with clinical isolates suggested that strain associated with invasive diseases are
significantly more likely to have two fnb genes [20].
Seven variants (isotypes I-VII) of FnBPA were identified based on divergence in the amino acid sequences of
the minimal ligand-binding N23 sub-domains [22]. Each
FnBPA isotype retained ligand-binding activity but were
antigenically distinct. Modelling the 3D structures
showed that the amino acid variation occurred in surface-exposed residues and not in those involved in
ligand-binding [22].
The initial aim of this study was to characterize the A
domain of FnBPB and to determine the extent of variation in the A domain. It was discovered that the A domain
of all FnBPB isotypes had the ability to bind to fibronectin
by a novel mechanism.

Results
fnbB gene variation in S. aureus whole-genome sequences

Previously we reported that the A domain of FnBPA from
strain P1 varied substantially from that of strain 8325-4,
sharing only 73.5% amino acid identity [11]. We then
identified seven variants of FnBPA A domain (isotypes IVII) based on divergence in the minimal ligand-binding
N23 sub-domain. Each recombinant N23 variant was
shown to retain ligand-binding function but was antigenically distinct [22]. This prompted us to investigate variation in the A domain of the second fibronectin-binding
protein, FnBPB.
DNA encoding the entire FnBPB A domain of strain P1
was amplified by PCR and sequenced. The deduced
amino acid sequence was compared with that of strain
8325-4 and the overall identity was 80%. The A domain
sequences of FnBPB from published S. aureus genomes
were compared to determine if diversity in this domain is
common amongst S. aureus isolates. All of the sequenced
strains, except strain MRSA252 and the bovine strain
RF122, contain genes encoding both FnBPA and FnBPB.
Strains MRSA252 and RF122 both encode the FnBPA
protein. The amino acid sequence of the A domain of
FnBPB from S. aureus strains 8325-4, COL, USA300,
Mu50, MSSA476, N315, MW2 and P1 were compared by
pair-wise alignments and the identities calculated. Strains
that are closely related and belonging to the same clonal
complex were found to share identical A domains. However, comparison of A domain sequences of strains from
different sequence types revealed that significant diversity exists. While subdomain N1 is highly conserved in all
strains (94-100% amino acid identity) the N2 and N3
domains from unrelated isolates are significantly more
divergent. Based on the sequences of the N23 subdomains, four variants of FnBPB (isotypes I-IV) were identified that share 61.1 - 80.6% amino acid identity (Table 1).
DNA hybridization analysis using fnbB isotype-specific
probes

To determine the distribution of FnBPB A domain isotypes I - IV in S. aureus strains of different MLSTs and to

identify any novel A domain isotypes, DNA hybridization
was used with isotype-specific probes homologous to
DNA specifying a portion of the highly divergent N3 subdomain. DNA encoding the entire A domain was amplified with A domain flanking primers. PCR products were
then spotted onto membranes and hybridized with the
DIG-labelled type-specific probes. An example of the
hybridization experiments with probes I - IV is shown in
Figure 2. The probes were shown to be type-specific
because each only hybridized to the appropriate control
fnbB fragment (Figure 2A-D, top rows). fnbB DNA from
S. aureus strains 2 (ST7),114 (ST39), 233 (ST45), 304
(ST39), 138 (ST30), 563 (ST37), 3077 (ST17) and 3110
(ST12) did not hybridise to any of the probes, indicating
that they may specify novel FnBPB isotypes or lack the
fnbB gene.
Identification of novel FnBPB isotypes (Types V, VI and VII)

The fnbB gene fragments amplified from S. aureus strains
2 (ST7) 114 (ST39), 233 (ST45), 304 (ST39), 138 (ST30),
563 (ST37), 3077 (ST17) and 3110 (ST12) did not hybridise to probes specific for FnBPB isotypes I-IV. The fnbB
gene fragments from these strains were cloned and
sequenced, and the deduced A domain amino acid
sequences were compared to the sequences of A domains
of types I - IV. S. aureus strains 2 (ST7) and 3110 (ST12)
specify a novel FnBPB A domain called isotype V (N23,
68.8 - 73.3% identical to isotypes I - IV). The A domains
of strains 3077 (ST17) and 233 (ST45) are also different
and are called isotype VI (N23, 66.0- 76.6% identical to
types I - V) and isotype VII (N23, 66.2% - 85% identical to
types I-VI) (Table 1). Strains 114, 563, 138 and 304 specify an identical A domain which is 92% identical to isotype II and is called isotype II* (Table 1)
Phylogenetic analysis of FnBPB A domain isotypes I-VII

Figure 3 shows a neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree
which was constructed based upon the concatenated
sequences of the seven housekeeping genes used for
MLST analysis. As MLST reflects the evolution of the
stable core genome [23], this tree describes the phyloge-

Figure 2 FnBPB A domain typing of S.aureus strains by dot blot
hybridisation. DNA fragments coding for the entire A domain of fnbB
were amplified by PCR from clinical S.aureus isolates. PCR products
were spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with DIG-labelled probes specific for fnbB isotype I (A), II (B), III (C) and IV (D). fnbB
DNA from strains 8325-4, N315, MSSA476 and P1 was used as control.

netic relatedness of the S. aureus strains studied here. It is
separated into two major clusters as was also shown previously in a detailed phylogenetic analysis of thirty
diverse S.aureus isolates [24]. The FnBPB A domain isotypes specified by each genotype (as predicted by DNA
hybridisation or sequencing) are indicated. The phylogeny of fnbB alleles illustrated here does not correspond to
that of the core genome as determined by MLST. For
example, two strains that cluster together in Group 1
(ST49 and ST52) carry fnbB genes encoding isotype II, as
do distantly related strains from Group 2 (ST5 and ST18).
Conversely, clustered strains such as ST8 and ST97 from
Group 2 contain fnbB genes encoding isotypes I and IV,
respectively. Isolates belonging to the same ST (ST45)
were found to specify different FnBPB isotypes (II and
VII). These results suggest that fnbB alleles have dispersed by horizontal transfer, most likely by homologous
recombination.
It has been recently reported that strains 116 (ST9) and
3077 (ST17) specify an identical FnBPA A domain called
isotype II [22]. In this study, these strains were found to
specify different FnBPB A domains, isotypes II and VI
respectively. This indicates that the phylogeny of fnbB
alleles does not match that of fnbA alleles despite the two
genes being closely linked.
FnBP isotypes encoded by bovine S. aureus strains

We expanded the investigation into FnBP variation to
include FnBPs from a variety of bovine S. aureus strains.
Nineteen bovine isolates representing genetically unrelated strains were screened to determine if they specified
the same FnBP isotypes as human strains. This strain collection included strain RF122, the genome of which has

been sequenced [25]. RF122 contains only one fnb gene
encoding FnBPA.
DNA encoding fnbA was amplified from the genomic
DNA of each strain using generic A domain primers. PCR
products hybridised to FnBPA probes specific for isotypes I, II, III or IV. Similarly fnbB DNA was amplified by
PCR from the genomic DNA of all strains except RF122.
These PCR products hybridised to FnBPB probes specific
for isotype I, II, III, IV or V. These results indicate that the
FnBP isotypes which are expressed by human strains are
also specified by bovine strains. Furthermore, the results
of this study suggest that the lack of fnbB in the genome
of strain RF122 is not characteristic of all bovine strains.
None of the strains tested specify FnBPA or FnBPB isotypes V, VI or VII.
Figure 4 shows a neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree
which was constructed based on MLST data as described
above. The FnBPA and FnBPB A domain isotypes specified by each genotype are included. The distribution of
fnbB and fnbA variants does not correlate with the
genetic relatedness of the strains as determined by MLST.
The phylogeny of fnb alleles carried by bovine S. aureus
isolates is therefore very similar to that of human strains.
Generation of 3D-models for FnBPB (N23) types I-VII and
mapping the location of variant amino acid residues

Theoretical models of the structure of region A (N23) of
FnBPB isotypes I-VII were generated based on the crystal
structure of the equivalent domains of the S. aureus
clumping factor ClfA. A ligand-binding trench is predicted to form between the N2 and N3 domains of
FnBPB. C-terminal residues in sub-domain N3 are predicted to form the putative latching peptide. In each of
the seven molecular models, the variant residues mapped
to the surface of the protein while the residues within the
predicted ligand-binding trench are highly conserved
(Figure 5.). The predicted 3D structure obtained for
FnBPB type I of strain 8325-4 and the predicted location
of variant residues is shown in Figure 4. Residues 467-480
of FnBPB isotype I comprise the predicted latching peptide and are shown here in blue. In the crystal structure of
the apo form of ClfA the latching peptide is folded over
the N3 subdomain.
Antigenic variation: binding of antibodies to isotypes I-VII

We previously demonstrated that variation in the A
domain of FnBPA resulted in proteins that are antigenically distinct. Here the ability of polyclonal anti-isotype I
antibodies and a monoclonal anti-isotype I antibody to
bind different recombinant FnBPB N23 isotypes was
measured by ELISA. Polyclonal rabbit anti-isotype I antibodies had a 4 - 9 fold lower affinity at half maximum
binding for isotypes II - VII compared to isotype I (Figure
6). This suggests that amino acid variation creates differ-

7c). Recombinant FnBPA isotype I, which was previously
shown not to bind fibronectin, was a used was as a negative control. The ability of the FnBPB A domain proteins
to bind fibronectin was surprising because the amino
acid sequences do not contain any known fibronectinbinding motifs.

Binding of FnBPB A domains isotypes I - VII to immobilized
ligands (ELISA)

Measuring the affinity of FnBPB A domain isotype I for
fibrinogen, elastin and fibronectin by surface plasmon
resonance

Each recombinant N23 isotype bound to immobilized
fibrinogen and elastin in a dose-dependent and saturable
manner as shown in Figure 7. The estimated half maximum binding concentrations were 0.5 μM and 0.9 μM
respectively. These results confirm that the revised coordinates of the N23 subdomain of region A of FnBPB
(isotypes I-VII) is sufficient for ligand-binding and that
subdomain N1 is not required.
Somewhat surprisingly, the seven N23 isotypes also
bound fibronectin dose-dependently and saturably with a
half-maximum binding concentration of 1.5 μM (Figure

The results of the solid-phase binding assays suggested
that the A domain of FnBPB binds fibrinogen, elastin and
fibronectin with similar affinity. Estimated half maximal
binding concentrations were in the low micromolar
range. To verify these results, the affinities of rN23 isotype I for fibrinogen, elastin and fibronectin were measured using Surface Plasmon Resonance. Human
fibrinogen, elastin and fibronectin were immobilized
onto the surface of dextran chips. rN23 type I protein was
passed over the surface in concentrations ranging from

Discussion
The colonization of host tissue by S. aureus is an important factor in disease pathogenesis. S. aureus expresses on
its cell surface a number of MSCRAMMS that promote
colonization of diverse sites and contribute to virulence.
Most S. aureus strains can express two distinct fibronectin-binding proteins (FnBPA and FnBPB). These two multifunctional MSCRAMMs both mediate adhesion to
fibrinogen, elastin and fibronectin.

FnBPA and FnBPB are encoded by the two closely
linked genes, fnbA and fnbB [20]. It has been reported
that the fnbA and fnbB genes from 50 different strains
representing the major MRSA clones found in Europe
have undergone greater sequence divergence than genes
encoding other surface proteins such as clfA and clfB [26].
Analysis of the fnb genes from published genome
sequences showed that divergence was confined to the
region encoding the N-terminal fibrinogen and elastinbinding A domains while the C-terminal fibronectinbinding motifs were highly conserved ([22] and this
study). Our previous study identified seven isotypes of
FnBPA based on divergence in the minimal ligand-binding N23 sub-domain [22]. Each recombinant isotype was
found to retain ligand-binding function but was antigenically distinct.

The fourteen C-terminal residues that are predicted to form the putative latching peptide are shown in blue. Residues that differ in FnBPB
types II, III and IV are highlighted in red in the ribbon (B) and space fill

This study aimed to investigate the divergence in the A
domain of FnBPB and to determine if variation in this
region of the protein is widespread amongst S. aureus
strains. The fnbB gene sequences from sequenced S.
aureus strains and strain P1 were compared. Four FnBPB
variants (isotypes I-IV) were identified based on divergence in N23 sub-domains, which are 66-76% identical to
one another.
In order to determine the distribution of FnBPB isotypes I-IV and to identify novel isotypes, type specific
probes were generated and used to screen fnbB DNA

from a variety of clonal types using a well-characterized
strain collection of human origin and human isolates
where genomes have been fully sequenced [27]. Three
novel FnBPB isotypes were identified (types V, VI and
VII) which are 61.1% - 85% identical to isotypes I-IV. Phylogenetic analysis of FnBPB isotypes indicated that the
phylogeny of fnbB alleles does not correlate with the core
genome as reflected by MLST. The evolution of S. aureus
has been predominantly clonal where alleles are 5- to 10fold more likely to diversify by point mutations than by
recombination [27]. The distribution of fnbB alleles
amongst different S. aureus lineages suggests, however,
that recombination has been involved. Horizontal transfer by homologous recombination is likely to be responsible for the dispersal of genes encoding the same isotypes
across strains of different phylogenies. The distribution of
fnbA alleles described in the study by Loughman et al
does not match the distribution of fnbB alleles described
here [22]. Different combinations of FnBPA and FnBPB
isotypes are specified by strains that cluster phylogenetically. For example, strains belonging to ST12 were shown
to specify FnBPB Type V and FnBPA Type V. By contrast,
strains belonging to ST13 specified FnBPB Type IV and
FnBPA Type V. This suggests that the phylogeny of fnbB
alleles has evolved independently from that of fnbA
alleles and has involved separate recombination events
despite the genes being closely linked.
Our study of FnBP variation in S. aureus was extended
here to include bovine S. aureus strains. The genome of
the bovine strain RF122 contains only the fnbA gene but
lacks fnbB. Using generic primers, DNA encoding FnBPA
and FnBPB was amplified from genomic DNA of nineteen bovine S. aureus strains. The amplification of fnbB
DNA from these strains indicates that the lack of the fnbB
gene in strain RF122 is not common to all bovine S.
aureus strains. The fnbA and fnbB PCR products were
subsequently probed with DNA probes specific for A
domain isotypes specified by human S. aureus strains. It
was shown that bovine isolates specify the some of the
same isotypes of FnBPA and FnBPB as those specified by
human isolates. The distribution of isotypes across the
population of bovine strains tested was found to be
uneven. No strains tested specified FnBPA isotypes V, VI
or VII or FnBPB isotypes VI or VII. The majority of the
strains tested were found to specify FnBPA Type IV and
FnBPB Type II. Interestingly in the study of Loughman et
al, FnBPA Type II was found to be predominant in human
clinical isolates [22]. It could be postulated that this difference in FnBPA isotype frequency reflects the differences in selective pressures posed by these two distinct
host immune systems.
Further evidence for the role of recombination in the
evolution of S.aureus comes from the genome structure
of ST239 strains which are composed of 557 kb of ST8

DNA spliced into 2,220 kb of an ST30 strain [28]. Also,
the gene for coagulase has undergone similar diversification as the fnb genes [29]. Recombination within coa
genes encodeding ten major isotypes has created novel
subtypes and there is evidence for the same coa isotype
being expressed by strains with different genetic backgrounds suggesting horizontal dissemination by homologous recombination [29].
A 3D molecular model of the N2 and N3 domains of
FnBPB was generated based on the known structure of
ClfA. Like the A domain of ClfA (and FnBPA) it is predicted that the N23 subdomain of FnBPB represents the
minimal ligand binding region and a ligand binding

trench is predicted to form between the N2 and N3 subdomains. Based on this model, it was shown that the
majority of variant residues are located on the surface of
the protein while residues that are predicted to be
involved in ligand-binding are highly conserved. Amino
acid sequence variation affected antibody recognition.
Polyclonal antibodies against isotype I had reduced affinity for isotypes II - VII while a monoclonal antibody
raised against isotype I had little or no affinity for all
other isotypes. As with FnBPA isotypes, FnBPB sequence
variation has created different epitopes on the A domains
that affect immunocross-reactivity. This result is consistent with the predicted location of variant residues on the

Figure 8 Dose-dependent binding of rFnBPB to fibrinogen (a), elastin (b) and fibronectin (c) as determined by Surface Plasmon Resonance.
Human fibrinogen, elastin and fibronectin were immobilised onto the surface of dextran chips. In each assay, recombinant FnBPB N23 isotype I was
passed over the surface in concentrations ranging from 0.15 μM (lower-most trace) to 10 μM (upper-most trace). The phases of association and dissociation are indicated. The representative sensorgrams have been corrected for the response obtained when recombinant FnBPB proteins were

surface of the protein and not in regions involved in
ligand binding.
While most strains contain both genes, some strains
contain only fnbA [20]. Studies with site-specific fnbA
and fnbB insertion mutants of strain 8325-4 have shown
that either FnBPA or FnBPB can mediate adherence to
immobilized fibronectin, but there was no difference in
adherence between wild type strains and single fnb
mutants, indicating functional redundancy [21]. However, isolates associated with invasive diseases are significantly more likely to have two fnb genes [20]. Combined
antigenic variation in both FnBPA and FnBPB may be
employed by S. aureus to thwart the host immune

responses during colonization or invasive infection.
Interestingly, the diversity which occurs in the N2 and N3
subdomains of FnBPA and FnBPB does not occur in the
N1 subdomain of either protein. For both FnBP proteins,
the N1 subdomain is not required for ligand binding,
similar to ClfA [13]. The A domain of both ClfA and
another S. aureus fibrinogen binding protein, clumping
factor B (ClfB), are susceptible to cleavage by aureolysin
at a SLAVA/SLAAVA motif located between subdomains
N1 and N2 [30]. A SLAVA-like motif occurs in both FnBP
proteins with S177ADVA181 and S144TDVTA149 present in
FnBPA isotype I and FnBPB isotype I, respectively, which
may render the A domains similarly susceptible to prote-

Burke et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:160
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/160

olysis. Perhaps the highly conserved N1 subdomains are
less readily recognized by the host immune system and
may function to protect the ligand-binding N2N3 during
early stages of infection.
The ligand binding ability of recombinant FnBPB N23
subdomain isotypes I-VII was compared by ELISA-based
solid phase binding assays. Each A domain isotype bound
to immobilized fibrinogen and elastin with similar affinities. These results confirm that like the A domains of
ClfA and FnBPA, the N23 subdomain of FnBPB is sufficient for ligand-binding and that the N1 subdomain is not
required for ligand-binding. The results also suggest that
these ligand-binding functions are biologically important
and are consistent with the predicted location of variant
residues on the surface of the protein and not in regions
predicted to be involved in ligand binding. Using the
recombinant N23 isotype I protein as a prototype, the
affinity of FnBPB for fibrinogen and elastin was analysed
by SPR. The KD for both interactions was in the low micro
molar range.
Somewhat surprisingly, the seven recombinant N23
FnBPB isotypes examined in this study bound immobilized fibronectin with similar affinity. The interaction
between rN23 Type I (residues 162-480) was verified by
SPR analysis with a KD in the low micro molar range. The
results of these fibronectin-binding assays are surprising
because this region of FnBPB does not contain any
known fibronectin-binding motifs suggesting that the A
domains of FnBPB (isotypes I-VII) contain a novel
fibronectin-binding motif and may bind fibronectin by a
novel mechanism. Experiments are currently underway
to examine the biological significance of fibronectinbinding by the A domain of FnBPB and to determine a
mechanism for this interaction and identify the FnBPB
binding region(s) in human fibronectin.

Conclusions
We have identified seven isotypes of the N terminal A
domain of FnBPB in a genetically diverse collection of
human S. sureus strains. Amino acid variation creates differences in immuno-crossreactivity while ligand-binding
functions are maintained. This may contribute to
immune evasion by S. aureus. The distribution of FnBPB
isotypes throughout the S. aureus population is random
but does not correlate with the random distribution of
FnBPA isotypes described previously. This suggests that
fnbA and fnbB alleles have been dispersed independently
by horizontal transfer which most likely involved homologous recombination. Four of the seven FnBPB isotypes
were also identified in bovine S. aureus strains. The lack
of fnbB in strain RF122 is not common to all bovine
strains. All seven recombinant A domain isotypes bound
fibronectin with a KD in the low micro molar range. This

raises the possibility that the A domain of FnBPB binds
fibronectin by a novel mechanism. These data have implications for the FnBPB A domain as a target for a vaccine
or immunotherapeutics.

Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions

Escherichia coli strains were cultivated on L-agar and Lbroth with shaking at 37°C. Cloning was routinely performed in E. coli strain XL-1 Blue (Stratagene). E. coli
strain TOPP 3 (Qiagen) was used for the expression of
recombinant FnBPB A domain proteins. Ampicillin (100
μg ml-1) was incorporated into growth media where
appropriate. The Staphylococcus aureus strains used in
this study are listed in Table 2 and were cultivated on
trypticase soy agar (TSA) or broth (TSB). Human S.
aureus strains from individuals from Oxfordshire, U.K
have been characterized by multi-locus sequence typing
(MLST) [27]. Strain P1 is a rabbit virulent strain [31] and
has been characterised by MLST [22]. Bovine S.aureus
strains were a kind gift from Cyril Smyth (Trinity College,
Dublin). They were isolated from geographically diverse
locations and were characterized by MLST [32].
Genetic techniques

Plasmid DNA was isolated using the Wizard® Plus SV
Miniprep kit (Promega) according to manufacturer's
instructions and finally transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue
cells using standard procedures [33]. Chromosomal DNA
was extracted using the Bacterial Genomic DNA purification kit (Edge Biosystems). Restriction digests and ligations were carried out using enzymes from New England
Biolabs and Roche according to the manufacturers' protocols. Oligonucleotides were purchased from SigmaGenosys and are listed in Table 3. DNA purification was
carried out using the Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean-up
System (Promega).
Cloning of fnbB gene fragments

Generic primers, corresponding to conserved DNA
encoding the signal sequence and fibronectin binding
domain 2, were designed from conserved sequences in
fnbB genes from publicly available S. aureus genomes.
PCR products were cleaved with BamHI restriction sites
incorporated into the primers, ligated to BamHI-cleaved
pBluescript DNA and transformed into E. coli. The
cloned fnbB gene fragments were sequenced using T3
and T7 primers by GATC Biotech AG (Germany).
DNA hybridisation using fnbB type-specific probes

DIG-labelled isotype-specific probes were synthesised by
PCR. Primers were designed to amplify a small region of
DNA (~300 bp) in the N3 sub-domain of isotypes I-VII.
The PCR products were labelled by incorporating DIG-

labelled dNTPs (Roche). Five ng of DNA encoding the A
domain of FnBPB from clinical isolates was spotted onto
positively charged nylon membranes (Roche) and allowed
to air-dry. Membranes were incubated for 5 min on blotting paper soaked in denaturation solution (1.5 M NaCl,
0.5 M NaOH), 5 min in neutralization solution (1.5 M
NaCl, 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), and finally for 15 min on
blotting paper soaked with 2× SSC solution (300 mM
NaCl, 30 mM tri-sodium citrate). DNA was fixed on the
membranes by incubation at 120°C for 30 min. Membranes were incubated for 2 h at 68°C in pre-hybridization solution (5× SSC, 0.1% w/v N-lauroylsarcosine,
0.02% w/v SDS and 1× Blocking Reagent (Roche). DIGlabelled probes were denatured by heating at 95°C for 10
min, diluted in pre-hybridization solution and incubated
with nylon membranes for 18 h at 68°C. Following
hybridization, the membranes were washed twice with 2×
SSC/0.1% w/v SDS at room temperature followed by two
washes with 0.5× SSC/0.1% w/v SDS at 68°C for 20 min.
Membranes were equilibrated for 30 min in maleic acid
buffer (100 mM maleic acid, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5), and
bound DIG-labelled probes were detected by incubation
for 30 min with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antiDIG antibody (Roche) diluted 1:10,000 in maleic acid
buffer. After washing twice with maleic acid buffer containing 0.3% v/v Tween 20, the chemiluminescence substrate CSPD (Roche) was used to detect bound anti-DIG
antibodies and membranes were exposed to X-OMAT
UV Plus Film (Kodak).
Bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis of FnBPB A
domain isotypes

Protein sequences were aligned in pairwise combinations
to calculate amino acid identity using the ExPASY SIM
alignment tool http://www.expasy.org/tools/sim-prot.
html. The concatenated MLST allele sequences of S.
aureus strains were downloaded from the MLST database http://saureus.mlst.net/. A phylogenetic analysis of
concatenated MLST allele sequences was conducted
using MEGA version 4 [34]. Alignments of multiple protein sequences to view areas of conservation amongst A
domains were performed using Clustal W http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/
Generation of 3D-models for FnBPB (N23) types I-VII

Theoretical models of the structure of region A (N23)
types I-VII were obtained by submitting the amino acid
sequences for this segment of each protein to the Phyre
service of the 3D-PSSM website http://www.sbg.bio.
ic.ac.uk/phyre/. This web-based tool models the structure of these sequences based structure of the equivalent
domains of the S. aureus clumping factor ClfA. All structures were viewed using the pyMOL viewing software.

Expression of recombinant FnBPB A domain proteins

Primers were designed to amplify DNA encoding residues 162-480 (N23 sub-domain) of FnBPB isotype I from
strain 8325-4 by PCR. The primers included BamHI and
SmaI restriction sites to facilitate cloning into the multiple cloning site of the N-terminal six-histidine tag expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen) and incorporated a 3' stop
codon. The equivalent N23 regions of FnBPB isotypes
types II-VII were PCR-amplified from strains N315,
MSSA476, P1, 2, 3077 and 233, respectively. The PCR
products were cloned separately into pQE30 and transformed into E. coli cells for protein production. Each construct was verified by sequencing (GATC Biotech AG,
Germany) and proteins were purified by Ni2+ chelate
chromatography [35]. Concentrations were determined
using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Proteins were
dialysed against PBS for 24 h at 4°C, aliquoted and stored
at -70°C.
Direct binding of recombinant FnBPB A domain proteins to
immobilized elastin, fibrinogen and fibronectin

Human aortic elastin (Elastin Products Company; 50 μg/
ml) was coated onto microtiter wells for 18 hr under UV
light. Wells coated with human fibrinogen (Calbiochem;
10 μg/ml), and fibronectin (Calbiochem; 10 μg/ml) were
placed at 4°C overnight. All plates were blocked with 5%
skimmed milk in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 2 hr
at 37°C. Following three washes with PBS containing
0.05% v/v Tween 20 (PBST) various concentrations of
purified rFnBPB N23 constructs in PBS were added and
incubated at 37°C for 2 hr. After three washes with PBST,
bound protein was detected by incubation with a 1:500
dilution of monoclonal antibody 7E8 that recognizes the
N-terminal hexahistidine fusion tag. After 1 h incubation
with shaking at room temperature, the wells were washed
three times with PBST followed by 100 μl per well of
goat-anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish-peroxidase (HRP, Dako; Denmark) diluted 1:2000.
After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, wells were
washed three times with PBST, and bound HRP-conjugated antibodies were detected with 10 μg per well of
3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB; Sigma) in 0.05 M
phosphate-citrate buffer containing 0.006% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide. After incubation at room temperature for 5
min the reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 2 M
H2SO4. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured with an
ELISA plate reader (Multiskan EX, Labsystems).
The purity of the commercial fibronectin used in these
assays was examined by SDS-PAGE. ELISA experiments
with anti-fibrinogen antibodies revealed that the
fibronectin was free of fibrinogen contamination.

ELISA assays

Various concentrations of recombinant FnBPB A domain
proteins in PBS were coated onto Nunc 96-well microtitre dishes for 18 h at 4°C. Wells were washed and
blocked with BSA for 2 h as described above. Following
three washes with PBST, 100 μl of anti-FnBPB A domain
antibodies diluted in BSA-PBST (1.8 μg polyclonal IgG
ml-1; 2.5 μg monoclonal IgG ml-1) were added to each well
and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with shaking.
Polyclonal antibody raised against the isotype I N23
domain of FnBPB was obtained by immunizing specific
pathogen-free rabbits with rFnBPB37-480 from S. aureus
8325-4. Monoclonal antibody 12E11 was generated by
immunizing mice with recombinant isotype I FnBPB37480. After 1 h incubation the wells were washed three
times with PBST. Goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugated
antibodies or goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugated antibodies (Dako, Denmark), each diluted 1:2000 in BSAPBST, were added to the wells and incubated for 1 h.
After washing three times with PBST, bound HRP-conjugated antibodies were detected as described above.
Analysis of fibrinogen, elastin and fibronectin binding by
surface plasmon resonance

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was preformed using
the BIAcore ×100 system (GE Healthcare). Human fibrinogen (Calbiochem), aortic elastin (Enzyme Research Laboratories) and fibronectin (Calbiochem) were covalently
immobilized on CM5 sensor chips using amine coupling.
This was performed using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), followed by
N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and ethanolamine hydrochloride, as described by the manufacturer. Fibrinogen
(50 μg/ml), elastin (50 μg/ml) and fibronectin (50 μg/ml)
were dissolved in 10 mM sodium acetate at pH 4.5 and
immobilized on separate chips at a flow rate of 30 μl/min
in PBS (Gibco). Each chip contained a second flow cell,
which was uncoated to provide negative controls. All sensorgram data presented were subtracted from the corresponding data from the blank cell. The response
generated from injection of buffer over the chip was also
subtracted from all sensorgrams. Equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated using the BIA ×100
evaluation software version 1.0.
