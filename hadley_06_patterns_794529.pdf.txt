Conclusion: Highly conserved elements in nonprotein coding regions of 150 presynaptic genes
represent sequences that may be involved in the transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation
of these genes. Furthermore, comparative sequence analysis will facilitate selection of genes and
noncoding sequences for future functional studies and analysis of variation studies in
neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.

Results: Evolutionary rate analysis revealed that presynaptic proteins evolve slowly, although
some members of large gene families exhibit accelerated evolutionary rates relative to other family
members. Comparative sequence analysis of 46 megabases spanning 150 presynaptic genes
identified more than 26,000 elements that are highly conserved in eight vertebrate species, as well
as a small subset of sequences (6%) that are shared among unrelated presynaptic genes. Analysis of
large gene families revealed that upstream and intronic regions of closely related family members
are extremely divergent. We also identified 504 exceptionally long conserved elements (≥360 base
pairs, ≥80% pair-wise identity between human and other mammals) in intergenic and intronic
regions of presynaptic genes. Many of these elements form a highly stable stem-loop RNA structure
and consequently are candidates for novel regulatory elements, whereas some conserved
noncoding elements are shown to correlate with specific gene expression profiles. The SynapseDB
online database integrates these findings and other functional genomic resources for synaptic genes.

Background: The neuronal synapse is a fundamental functional unit in the central nervous system
of animals. Because synaptic function is evolutionarily conserved, we reasoned that functional
sequences of genes and related genomic elements known to play important roles in
neurotransmitter release would also be conserved.

Abstract

Hadley et al.

Background

The neuronal synapse is composed of presynaptic and postsynaptic components, and communication across these components is mediated by the release of neurotransmitters from
synaptic vesicles. This process is initiated in the presynaptic
terminal when an action potential opens voltage-gated Ca2+
channels and a Ca2+ influx triggers intracellular membrane
fusion between the synaptic vesicles and plasma membrane.
Before fusion, synaptic vesicles are targeted to dock at the
active zone of the presynaptic membrane in a pathway that is
mediated by the formation and regulation of SNARE complexes. These multiprotein complexes are composed of proteins that are bound constitutively or transiently to the
synaptic vesicles or plasma membrane. Among them are synaptotagmins, the vesicular Ca2+ sensors that trigger the Ca2+
release. RAB proteins, at least RAB3, RAB5 and RAB11 family
members, form a large set of GTP-binding proteins that regulate vesicle transport, docking, and late steps in exocytosis.
RAB effectors include rabphilin, RIMs, RAB GDP dissociation inhibitor (RABGDI), RAB GTPase activating protein
(RAB3GAP), RAB GDP/GTP exchange protein (RAB3GEP)
and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), among others. There is a substantial volume of data on the biochemical
and physiological roles for a large number of presynaptic
genes, although their role with respect to behavior and
human disease is largely unknown [1].
Studies of neuronal synapses provide an excellent framework
for the analysis of regulatory elements involved in all major
levels of gene regulation. Although many genes involved in
synaptic function are expressed during the early stages of
development, an increase in their expression during development and in early postnatal stages, as well as the intricate
complexity of their temporal and spatial patterns of expression in the adult brain, implicate the role of transcriptional
control in their regulation [2,3]. Alternative transcription
start sites and splicing of pre-mRNA represents another versatile mechanism for cell-type specificity in the brain [4,5].
For example, the trans-synaptic interaction of neurexins on
the presynaptic terminal with neuroligins on the postsynaptic
terminal is thought to coordinate synaptic connectivity, and
this interaction is regulated by alternative splicing of both
neuroligin and neurexin genes [4-6].
To facilitate identification of regulatory elements that are
involved in the transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of gene expression in the neuronal synapse, we initiated a
large-scale comparative analysis of genomic sequence for
genes implicated in presynaptic function. Comparative
sequence analysis of rodent (mouse and rat) and human
genomes estimates that approximately 5% of small segments
of sequence (50-100 base pairs [bp]) are under negative or
purifying selection [7]; that is, nucleotide changes are occurring slower that would be expected given the underlying neutral mutation rate. Although a portion of this sequence can be
accounted for by protein-coding regions of the genome (1.5%)

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/11/R105

and untranslated regions of protein-coding genes (1%), the
function of the remaining 2.5% of conserved sequence
remains elusive. Experimental studies support claims that a
portion of these conserved noncoding sequences in intergenic
and intronic regions represent cis-regulatory elements [8,9].
Furthermore, recent evidence points to an important role that
short nonprotein coding RNAs, micro RNAs (miRNA) and
small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), play in gene regulation
[10,11].
Despite efforts to elucidate the function of noncoding conserved elements at the level of the entire genome, the identification, functional annotation, and systematic classification
of the elements vis à vis a specific pathway remains incomplete. The synapse, involving both the presynaptic and postsynaptic cellular compartments, forms a distinct functional
unit within a neuronal cell, and the associated molecular
processes are parts of distinct localized pathways [12,13]. Our
goal is to use the neuronal synapse as a model for comparative
and integrative sequence analysis in order to generate systematically an inventory of putative functional genomic elements in a subcellular compartment by dissecting patterns of
molecular evolution for subsequences surrounding presynaptic genes both within and between species.
In this study we conducted analyses of the genomic neighborhoods surrounding presynaptic genes from whole-genome
multiple alignments of human with seven other vertebrate
genomes. We find that genes that are involved in presynaptic
transmission exhibit stronger evidence of purifying selection
than do vertebrate genes as a whole. Interestingly, however,
in large gene families at least one member often shows unusually relaxed purifying selection with a higher accumulation
of amino acid changes compared with the other members of
the family. Overall, there are many segments of noncoding
regions that are well conserved across orthologous genomic
segments but show divergence within paralogous regions of
the same genome, suggesting an ancestral pattern of cis-regulatory functional divergence and stabilization within the
vertebrate lineages. Furthermore, our studies provide a catalog of exceptionally long (≥360 bp) highly conserved
sequences (>80% pair-wise identity from humans to mammals and >70% pair-wise identity from humans to nonmammals). In some cases, identified elements map in the vicinity
of exon-intron boundaries of experimentally validated functional and developmentally regulated splice forms. Therefore,
by classifying a large number of these discrete elements with
respect to their relative genic position (intergenic, intronic,
5'- and 3'-untranslated region [UTR], and intron-exon
boundary) and their potential to encode RNA or form stable
RNA structure, we provide a foundation for more informed
functional studies.

Our analysis focuses on a set of 150 proteins mainly in the
presynaptic nerve terminal known to participate in synaptogenesis or neurotransmitter release (Table 1). Using literature searches we first compiled a list of human genes
implicated in synaptic vesicle exocytosis based on biochemical and functional studies [1,14]. We then established SynapseDB [15], which is a database of synaptic process genes/
proteins in the human genome and their orthologs in multiple
species such as the mouse (Mus musculus), rat (Rattus norvegicus), dog (Canis familiaris), chicken (Gallus gallus),
zebrafish (Danio renio), puffer fish (Takifugu rubripes),
fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster), and worm (Caenorhabditis elegans). For the majority of presynaptic genes we established orthology by a straightforward mapping of the pair-

wise reciprocal best BLAST (basic local alignment search
tool) hits [16]. In addition to the nucleotide and protein
sequence alignment, the establishment of paralogy/orthology
relationships for large gene families required comparison of
syntenic gene order to unambiguously identify orthologs and
species-specific paralogs derived from gene duplication. In
cases in which presynaptic genes belong to large gene families, we generally included all known paralogs regardless of
their function in the presynaptic neuron. We also considered
in our analysis neuroligins, a family of trans-synaptic proteins on the postsynaptic terminal known to interact with
neurexins on the presynaptic terminal.

Novartis Research Foundation [17,18]. Furthermore, in situ
hybridization patterns in adult brain are available for 91
selected genes from the Allen Brain Atlas [19]. To examine
patterns of conservation in the genomic neighborhood of 150
presynaptic genes, we defined genomic regions of interest
(gROIs) for each gene. The gROIs include protein-coding
regions with 5'-UTR and 3'-UTR, intronic sequences, and the
upstream and downstream regions as defined by the two
neighboring genes on the chromosome regardless of strand.
The gROIs for the 150 presynaptic genes encompass a total of
46 megabases (Mb) dispersed throughout the genome (Additional data file 1). Four pairs of genes had overlapping gROIs
(EPIM-RIMBP2, STX1B2-STX4A, GZMB-STXBP6, and
VAMP5-VAMP8) because of spatial proximity. Presynaptic
genes had an average (mean ± standard deviation) size of
145.1 ± 240.0 kilobases (kb), with a median size of 51.2 kb and
a range of 850 bp (CALML5) to 1.6 Mb (NRXN3). The gROIs
are on average 311.5 ± 531.7 kb, with a median size of 126.3
kb, and gROI sizes range from 2.3 kb (CAMK2N2) to 4.5 Mb
(NRXN1). The average size of the upstream regions is 115.9 ±
282.6 kb, with a median size of 29.9 kb and a maximum of 2.6
Mb (NRXN1). The average downstream size is 72.1 ± 152.9 kb
with a median of 15.0 kb and a maximum size of 1.0 Mb
(NLGN4Y). Nine presynaptic genes in our dataset were separated by more than 500 kb (within 'gene deserts') from any
neighboring genes (CAMK1G, NBEA, NCAM1, NLGN1,
NLGN4Y, NRXN1, SYT1, SYT10, and UNC13C).

change to the synonymous (silent) rate of change (dN/dS) for
pair-wise comparison of orthologs between human, mouse,
and rat. dN is the relative rate of nonsynonymous mutations,
and dS is the relative rate of synonymous mutations, and their
ratio dN/dS indicates the direction of selection pressure acting
on the proteins. Therefore, dN/dS < 1 suggests purifying selection, dN/dS = 1 suggests neutral selection, and dN/dS > 1 suggests positive selection. We were able to calculate dN/dS for
139 presynaptic genes and their average dN/dS is fivefold
lower than that of a comprehensive genomic survey of 15,398
homologous pairs of human-mouse transcripts (0.072 versus
0.413; Figure 1a), which suggests purifying selection has
broadly acted on genes known to be involved in synaptic
transmission, as previously reported [24]. For presynaptic
genes relative to the genomic survey, the average dN was
almost 20-fold lower (0.043 ± 0.005 versus 0.848 ± 0.004; P
< 0.001), and interestingly the average dS was almost fourfold
lower (0.558 ± 0.016 versus 2.171 ± 0.008; P < 0.001).

Before initiating systematic comparative analysis, we conducted a focused study of the molecular evolution of 150 presynaptic genes, including several large gene families. There
are 10 large gene families containing five or more members
such as calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase
(CAMK), exocyst complex (EXOC), neuroligins (NLGN),
secretory carrier membrane protein (SCAMP), synaptotagmins (SYT), syntaxins (STX), syntaxin binding protein
(STXBP), RAB GTPases (RAB), and vesicle associated membrane proteins (VAMP), as well as 15 smaller gene families
containing between two and five paralogs. The RAB family is
the largest family and evolutionary analysis for over 60 members has previously been reported [20,21]. We selected four
members from the RAB3 family and three from the RAB5
family because members of these subfamilies are thought to
be particularly important in the molecular dynamics of synaptic transmission [22,23]. In other families we consider all
known paralogs. Two families, namely the SYTs and STXs,
are considerably large, having 15 and 17 paralogs, respectively. All of the members of each family have orthologs in the
human, the mouse, and the rat with one exception. Based on
BLAST analysis and syntenic mapping, STX10 appears to
have no mouse or rat ortholog.

When we focused only on largest four gene families (RABs,
STXs, SYTs, and VAMPs), at least one family member exhibited elevated dN/dS compared with the remaining members;
the most extreme members were RAB3D, STX11, SYT8, and
VAMP5 in both human-mouse and human-rat comparisons
(Figure 1b,c). Thus, in each large gene family one member is
showing elevated levels of amino acid substitution relative to
the overall substitution rate of the family. To investigate the
human specificity of such outliers, we compared mouse-rat
divergence of the same genes (Figure 1d). Interestingly, SYT8
and VAMP5 appeared as outliers in the mouse-rat comparisons, suggesting that these genes are under less pressure for
purifying selection relative to other family members in all
three species considered. In the syntaxins, STX11 is the most
extreme outlier in both human-rodent comparisons, whereas
STX18 is the most extreme outlier in mouse-rat comparisons.
Similarly in the RAB family, RAB3D exhibits greater amino
acid evolution in human-rodent comparisons but not in
mouse-rat comparisons. Thus, this initial sequence analysis
of large gene families suggests both STX11 and RAB3D have
undergone human-specific patterns of faster amino acid fixations. The dN/dS ratio is still less than 1.0; therefore, this may
be due to more relaxed functional constraints on these genes
and less purifying selection. However, it is also possible that
small domains might be undergoing positive selection whose
rate is obscured by stabilizing selection on the remaining
parts of the molecule. For instance, a current comparative
analysis of human and great ape sequences found evidence
for positive selection on sequences encoding a protein
domain of unknown function (DUF1220), and these
unknown domains are highly expressed in brain regions associated with higher cognitive function, and in brain they show
neuron-specific expression preferentially in cell bodies and
dendrites [25].

To assess the rate of molecular evolution we computed the
ratio of the nonsynonymous (amino acid replacing) rate of

Phylogenetic analysis of gene families was performed for synaptotagmins (SYTs), syntaxins (STXs), RABs, and vesicle-

from which we selected seven closely related members in the
RAB3 and RAB5 subfamilies for analysis (RAB3A, RAB3B,
RAB3C, RAB3D, RAB5A, RAB5B, and RAB5C). The resulting
tree placed all orthologous copies in monophyletic clades,
indicating the RABs also diversified before the human-rodent
split (Additional data file 3). All orthologs separate into the
two subfamilies similar to the VAMP diversification with Drosophila RAB3 and RAB5 homologs, respectively dRAB3 and

outgroups whenever available. The VAMPs comprised the
smallest family, with six members (VAMP1, VAMP2, VAMP3,
VAMP4, VAMP5, and VAMP8), and all mammalian orthologous copies of this family form monophyletic groups (Additional data file 2), suggesting that the gene family diversified
before the current eutherian species diversification. Rooting
the tree from the two Drosophila homologs, dVAMP1 and
dVAMP2, separates two clades each with three members:
VAMP1 + VAMP2 + VAMP3 and VAMP4 + VAMP5 + VAMP8.
(We note that the Drosophila nomenclature does not reflect
homology relationships.) The split into these two clades was

ancestral two-gene family that respectively diversified in the
vertebrates. In the RAB3 subfamily, mammalian RAB3D was
consistently placed adjacent to dRAB3 with high significance,
a finding that was robust to different tree estimation techniques, which suggests that RAB3D diversified from the
ancestral vertebrate gene before RAB3A, RAB3B, and
RAB3C. Interestingly, RAB3D also exhibits an unusual pattern of greater amino acid changes with high dN/dS ratios in
both human-mouse and human-rat comparisons, but not in
the mouse-rat comparison, suggesting a human-specific
pattern.
In the STX family, all 14 protein-coding members analyzed
(STX1a, STX1b, STX2, STX3, STX4a, STX5a, STX6, STX7,
STX8, STX10, STX11, STX12, STX16, and STX18) formed
orthologous monophyletic groups with some notable features
(Additional data file 4). First, STX10, which is human specific, is placed basal to the mammalian STX6 clade (100%
bootstrap support), suggesting that STX10 diversified before
STX6 in the most recent common ancestor of human and
mouse, and then the copy was lost in the rodent lineage.
Interestingly, all Drosophila homologs are placed basal to
their mammalian counterparts either as sister taxa (STX1A,
STX5, STX16, and STX18) or at the base of an inclusive clade
(STX7). Thus, STXs appear to have diversified early in the
metazoan evolution with multiple ancestral copies, which
subsequently diversified further in the vertebrate or mammalian lineage. The absence of Drosophila homologs for well
supported clades such as hSTX10 + hSTX6 + mSTX6 suggests
loss of ancestral copies in flies. The structure of the phylogenetic tree suggests at least two additional ancestral copies
may have been lost in the invertebrate lineage.
In the SYT family, we analyzed 17 members with copies in
human and mouse along with four Drosophila homologs
(Additional data file 5). Again, all mammalian orthologous
genes formed monophyletic groups, suggesting that this family also diverged at the base of the mammalian lineage. The
only four Drosophila homologs identified were placed basal
to the mammalian clades of SYT7, STY4 + STY11, STY1, and
STY14 + SYT16, and given the size of the SYT family we may
be missing other putative ancestral copies for the other lineages. Being conservative and collapsing branches supported
by bootstrap values less than 65%, we predict that we are
missing the invertebrate homolog for the STY9 + STY10 +
STY6 + STY3 clade and the remaining paraphyletic group of
STY8 + STY13 + STY15 + STY17 + STY12. Thus, again for the
SYTs, there may have been six ancestral copies in the metazoan lineage.
Finally, to compare gene expression across tissues in a gene
family context, we superimposed expression profiles
obtained by microarray analysis of 79 human nonredundant
tissues and cell lines [18] on the phylogenetic trees described

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/11/R105

above. Among paralogs closely related by coding sequence,
there is considerable variation in patterns of gene expression.
We found the best correlation between protein sequence similarity and expression similarity in the RAB subfamilies
(Additional data file 6). Phylogenetic analysis of synaptotagmins and comparison with expression profiles illustrate two
possible scenarios (Figure 2). On one hand, closely related
paralogs SYT4-SYT11 within the same clade share a remarkably similar brain-enriched pattern of expression. On the other
hand, the SYT1-SYT2 pair within the same clade exhibit different expression profiles, with SYT1 showing strong enrichment across multiple brain tissues whereas SYT2 shows
strong enrichment in only 1 out of 18 brain tissues. Although
SYT5 is placed immediately basal to the SYT1-SYT2 clade, it
shares a similar broad brain-enrichment expression pattern
as SYT1. Close inspection of alignment of the SYT1, SYT2, and
SYT5 gROIs did not reveal nucleotide sequence homology
outside of exons (see Duplicated MCEs among gROIs, below).
Thus, the more narrow tissue specificity of SYT2 seems to be
an evolutionarily derived condition that is likely due to rapid
functional diversification of noncoding sequence after the
SYT1-SYT2 evolutionary split.

Comparative analysis of presynaptic genes
To automate comparative sequence analysis of gROIs we
established a computational pipeline (Figure 3a) to select and
analyze the most conserved elements (MCEs) from genomewide alignments of human with seven other vertebrate
genomes (the chimpanzee Pan troglodytes, the dog Canis
familiaris, the mouse Mus musculus, the rat Rattus norvegicus, the chicken Gallus gallus, the zebra fish Danio renio, and
the puffer fish Fugu rubripes) provided by the UCSC Genome
Browser [26,27]. MCEs were identified using phastCons, a
phylogenetic hidden Markov model that considers nucleotide
substitutions in a phylogenetic context. This algorithm is
suited to problems in which aligned sequences are to be
parsed into segments of different classes, such as 'conserved'
and 'nonconserved' [28]. By submitting 150 presynaptic
gROIs (covering more than 46 Mb) to the pipeline, we identified about 26,000 (26,197) MCEs for analysis, spanning
approximately 5% (2.5 Mb) of all gROI regions, corresponding to the portion of the human genome that is under selective
pressure [7,29]. MCEs were on average (mean ± standard
deviation) 86 ± 90 bp, with median size 54 bp (see Additional
data file 7 for a distribution of MCE lengths).
We classified each nucleotide in the gROI input sequence as
'coding', 'intronic', 'intergenic', or 'UTR', based on a combination of RefSeq and Ensembl annotation. For each gROI considered, we calculated the proportion of each class covered by
MCEs (see Additional data file 1). Across all gROIs, MCEs
cover about 81% of coding sequence, 37% of UTR sequence
(16-fold and 7-fold enrichments, respectively, compared with
the expected coverage if the predicted conserved elements
were distributed randomly across 5% of the genome), 5% of
intronic sequence and 4% of intergenic sequences (Figure

Comparative analysis of presynaptic genes
Comparative analysis of presynaptic genes. (a) Gene names from SynapseDB were used to query RefSeq and ENSEMBL transcript annotations, which
were then clustered into gene models defined as groups of overlapping transcripts in the same orientation. The region around the synaptic gene model
was extended up to the next annotated upstream and downstream gene models to define gROIs. MCEs were selected and characterized based on their
relative genic position into exon-associated and non-exon-associated elements. Exon-associated elements were further subdivided into those that are
completely exonic, those that are partially exonic and span exon-intron boundries, and those associated with UTRs; whereas non-exon-associated
elements were divided into those that are intergenic and those that are intronic. (b) Individual bases were annotated as CDS, UTR sequence (UTR),

3b). Considering the other direction, among the 2.5 Mb of
MCEs identified, the majority mapped to coding regions
(34%) and introns (31%), with smaller proportions mapping
to intergenic (22%) and UTR (13%) regions (Figure 3c). For
further analysis, we classified MCEs by their 'relative genic
position' (Figure 3a) in the automated pipeline. We divided
exon-associated conserved elements into those that are completely exonic, those that are partially exonic and span exonintron boundaries, and those that are associated with UTRs;
whereas non-exon-associated elements were divided into
those that are intergenic and those that are intronic.

Duplicated MCEs among gROIs
The MCEs represent conserved genomic segments found
across different species. It is also common to find duplicated
genomic segments within the same genome. These duplicated
segments can arise through a multitude of genomic events
including chromosome duplication, gene duplication, retroviral elements, among others. It is possible that these duplicated genomic segments may also be conserved across
different species, forming what we refer to as 'duplicated
MCE' (dMCE) subsequences. The dMCEs represent ancestrally duplicated genomic elements that have been independently conserved in disparate species, most likely due to
stabilizing selection. Such elements are unusual in that duplicated genomic segments typically diverge, either through
neutral degeneration or through positive selection for functional diversification [30,31]. Thus, dMCEs may represent
small parts of ancient duplications that are preserved because
of their core functional importance, for example as regulatory
elements that interact with a common trans-regulator.
To investigate the dMCE pairs we used BLASTN [32] for comparison of all 26,000 MCEs with themselves. We identified
2365 significant (E value ≤ 10-2) high scoring dMCE pairs
within 6% (1723/26,000) of all MCEs. We classified the
genomic subsequences comprising dMCEs by their relative

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/11/R105

genic position (Table 2). The vast majority of dMCE pairs
share broad relative genic position; 88% (895/1016) of pairs
involve one exon-associated dMCE paired to another exonassociated dMCE, and similarly 88% (1193/1349) of pairs
involve one non-exon-associated MCE paired to another nonexon-associated MCE. There were only 1,087 MCEs in the
non-exon-associated group, and although small in number
(1,087/26,000) this subset of MCEs represents a particularly
important group of sequences because they may correspond
to potential functional regulatory motifs (see below).
We classified all significant dMCE pairs as mapping to the
same gROI, mapping to paralagous gROIs, or mapping to
unrelated gROIs (Figure 4a and Table 3). In addition, we also
searched for palindromic matches to the same MCE (regions
in which the sequence is equivalent when read in either direction). The majority of exon-associated dMCE pairs mapped in
and around exons of paralogous gROIs, whereas most nonexon-associated duplicated MCE modules mapped to unrelated gROIs. We found a small number of dMCE pairs shared
by paralogous genes. The small proportion of intronic and
intergenic dMCE pairs that map to the same gROI reveal that
local segmental duplications and palindromes contributed to
the evolutionary history of 35 presynaptic genes. Palindromic
sequences accounted for 23 of these presynaptic genes (as
shown in Additional data file 8).
To test the hypothesis that dMCEs are preserved because of
their core functional importance, we compared members of
dMCE pairs with the same relative genic position (exonic exonic, exon-intron boundaries - exon-intron boundaries,
UTR - UTR, intergenic - intergenic, and intronic - intronic
MCEs) with a set of control unique MCEs (from all gROIs)
outside of any dMCE pair. We annotated the MCEs and
dMCEs according to the following: whether they mapped to
protein domains from ENSEMBL, whether they possessed
significant RNA secondary structure, and whether they

Counts by relative genic structure of members of paired dMCEs are shown. Exon-associated elements are type 1 and non-exon-associated elements
are type2. Type 1 MCEs are further decomposed into three putative functional groups: type 1a (exonic), those completely contained within an exon;
type 1b (partial exonic), those that span an intron-exons boundrary; and type 1c (UTR), those that include the 3'-UTR or 5'-UTR regions. Type 2
MCEs are divided into two subgroups: type 2a (intergenic), those located outside any annotated gene; and type 2b (intronic), those contained in the
intron of an annotated gene. dMCE, duplicated most conserved element; UTR, untranslated region.

Duplicated most conserved elements
Duplicated most conserved elements. (a) A schematic illustration of three classes of dMCEs in a hypothetical two-exon gene is shown. The blue rectangles
represent exons of three different two-exon genes, and the red arrows represent the relationship between pairs of duplicated MCEs relative to their
gROIs. GeneA1 and GeneA2 are paralogs in the same gene family, whereas GeneB represents an unrelated gene. The figure shows a local dMCE pair in the
same gROI upstream from GeneA1, an intronic pair of dMCE elements between the paralagous gROI of GeneA1 and GeneA2, and an intergenic pair of
dMCE elements downstream unrelated genes GeneA2 and GeneB. (b) Example of a dMCE pair between unrelated genes CAST1 (chromosome 3) and
SNAP25 (chromosome 20) is shown. The pair involves an element in the first intron of CAST1(.789) and an element in the last intron of SNAP25(.157).
Orthologous species shown in the alignments include chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes [pt]), dog (Canis familiaris [cf]), mouse (Mus musculus [mm]), rat (Rattus
norvegicus [rn]), chicken (Gallus gallus [gg]), and zebra fish (Danio renio [dr]). Both elements are conserved in mammals, and SNAP25 element exhibits
conservation in chicken and zebrafish. Both genes related to these elements exhibit increased expression in brain tissues, and reduced expression in
immune tissues and cell types. Both genes also show increased expression in hippocampus and throughout the cortex, although they differ in cerebellum
expression as shown by in situ expression patterns courtesy of Allen Brain Atlas [19]. dMCE, duplicated most conserved element; gROI, genomic region of

The relationship between genic structure of and the gROI relation of
dMCE pair members is shown. The genic structure of the (BLAST)
reference member of significant dMCE pairs is shown. The gROI
relation of dMCE pairs was classified as mapping to the same gROI

unrelated gROIs (unrelated). dMCE, duplicated most conserved
element; gROI, genomic region of interest.

mapped to public mRNA expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and
transcripts clustered by the Database of Transcribed
Sequences [33]. The proportion of dMCEs associated with
annotated protein domains is significantly greater than that
of controls (924/3091 [30%] versus 166/306 [54%]; P <
0.001). This is somewhat expected as many presynaptic genes
form large gene families that share sequence encoding protein domains. We found the proportion of MCEs associated
with the 3'-UTR portion of genes to be significantly enriched
for significant RNA secondary structure in dMCE pairs versus
unique MCEs (20/65 [31%] versus 18/215 [8%]; P < 0.001).
The proportion of intergenic dMCE pairs that exhibit evidence of transcription is significantly greater than that of controls (46/3666 [13%] versus 279/6562 [4%]; P < 0.001).
Thus, members of dMCE pairs, when found in the same relative genic position, exhibit greater evidence of functional
association than in control MCEs.
To investigate potential co-regulation among the (581) presynaptic gene pairs defined by 1,087 intronic and intergenic
dMCEs, we analyzed data from a microarray analysis of 79
human nonredundant tissues and cell lines [18] (Figure 5).
Expression clustering of transcripts detected by 291 unique
oligonucleotide probes on a chip corresponding to 144 presy-

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/11/R105

naptic genes in our dataset identified five distinct expression
profiles: transcripts with widespread and low levels of expression in most tissues/cell types; transcripts expressed in brain
and immune tissues and cell types but under-expressed in
other tissues; transcripts with enriched expression in brain
tissues and low levels of expression in other tissues; transcripts or splice forms enriched in hematopoietic derived
immune cell types; and transcripts or splice forms underexpressed in immune tissues and cell types. In about onethird of presynaptic genes with expression data (50/144),
selected gene probes/oligonucleotides detected different
transcripts or expression profiles (Additional data file 9).
Nonetheless, in every cluster there is a statistically significant
over-representation of pairs of genes sharing at least one
common dMCE subsequence (P values ≤ 1.4 × 10-7). The overrepresentation ranged from a 7.7-fold enrichment of gene
pairs sharing dMCEs in cluster 3 (with 158 gene pairs; Figure
4b and Figure 5c) to a 2.6-fold enrichment in cluster 4 (with
39 gene pairs; Table 4). Thus, the most significantly enriched
gene pairs were found in clusters with clear expression in
brain tissues (clusters 3 and 4).

Transcription factor binding sites in MCEs
The MCEs in intergenic and intronic regions of presynaptic
genes are candidates for regulatory elements. Therefore, we
used 546 positional weight matricies (PWMs) in the TRANSFAC database [34] to search all 26,000 MCEs, annotated by
their relative genic position. We found more than 200,000
hits to 338 different transcription factor binding sites
(TFBSs). To investigate which TFBS might be over-represented in presynaptic MCEs, we compared the relative occurrence of TFBSs in the subset of intronic and intergenic
presynaptic MCEs (which comprise 88% of all MCEs) to a
genome-wide randomly sampled set of MCEs. We found
enrichment of 16 TFBSs (CRX, LHX3, HNF-6, OCT-1, HFH8, POU6F1, MEF-2, EVI-1, NKX3A, TTF1, HOXA4, GATA-X,
SMAD, BRN-2, RFX1, and TST) in intronic and intergenic
presynaptic MCEs. Closer inspection revealed ten enriched
TFBSs (OCT-1, LHX3, GATA-X, MEF-2, NKX3A, GR, HNF-6,
SMAD, POU6F1, and FOXP3) in the intronic MCEs, ten
enriched TFBSs (CRX, LHX3, AP-1, HFH-8, RFX1, OCT-1,
MEIS1B:HOXA9, TCF-4, PBX-1, and TST-1) in the upstream
intergenic MCEs, and only two enriched TFBSs (RFX1 and
S8) in the downstream intergenic MCEs of presynaptic genes.
Thus, there is a significant enrichment in upstream and

enriched TFBSs found in that cluster, and lists the TFBS name, the observed count number of hits of that TFBS in intergenic and intronic MCEs, the fold
increase over that expected by chance, and the significance of enrichment in the cluster. Available PWM logos for all significantly enriched TFBSs (P < 0.05)
are also displayed. MCE, most conserved element; PWM, positional weight matrix; TFBS, transcription factor binding site.

The enrichment of the number of gene pairs defined by intergenic and intronic dMCEs in different clusters is shown in order of decreasing
enrichment. The table lists cluster # (see Figure 5 for cluster expression patterns), the observed number of gene pairs, the expected number of gene
pairs by chance, the enrichment of observed gene pairs, and the one-tailed binomial P value for the observed enrichment. dMCE, duplicated most
conserved element.

intronic MCEs but not in MCEs downstream of presynaptic
genes. Several of these transcription factors are known to be
involved in synaptogenesis or neuronal function such as Crx
[35], Lh3x [36], GR[37,38], SMAD [39,40], and OCT-1 [41].
Interestingly, of the 16 enriched TFBSs, 11 (CRX, FOXP3, GR,
HOXA4, LHX3, NKX3A, POU6F1, RFX1, S8, SMAD, and
TTF1) were located within duplicated MCEs discussed above.
To investigate whether particular TFBSs are differentially
associated with the five expression clusters of presynaptic
genes, we calculated the frequency of occurrence of each
TFBS within intronic and intergenic MCEs associated with
genes in each of the five clusters. We then quantified statistical differences in the frequency of each TFBS across the five
clusters (Figure 5a-e) to identify 32 TFBSs with a statistically
significant differential frequency of occurrence across all the
expression clusters (P < 0.05 by χ2 distribution after correcting for multiple tests; Additional data file 10). For each of
these 32 TFBSs, we carried out a post hoc contrast between
each cluster and the remaining clusters to assess whether any
of the TFBSs were particularly associated with a single cluster
(Figure 5). The most statistically significantly over-represented TFBS were found in MCEs in genes from the three
clusters exhibiting over-expression in immune tissues/cell
types (clusters 4, 2 and 1, in order of decreasing significance).
Furthermore, the top five enriched TFBSs in all three of these
clusters have statistically significant differences in their frequencies (P < 0.05 by Normal distribution) across the five
expression clusters. We did not detect a significant enrichment of TFBSs in expression clusters with transcripts underexpressed in immune tissues/cell types (clusters 3 and 4).
Thus, the statistical significance of TFBS enrichment in presynaptic genes appears to be correlated with over-expression
in immune tissues/cell types.

RAB6IP2) to over 1.2 kb (CASK), which we refer to as 'large
MCEs' (LMCEs). These elements encompass exons (37 exonic
and 23 partial exonic) and UTRs (22 UTR-5' and 38 UTR-3'),
with a majority found in intergenic (204) and intronic (180)
genomic regions. We found that 35% (8/23) of partial exonic
LMCEs that span intron-exon boundaries map to known
alternatively spliced exons in CAMK2G (.113 and .140), CASK
(.333), NLGN3 (.19), NRXN2 (.143), RIMS1 (.437), and
RIMS2 (.193). As expected, the number of LMCEs identified
is proportional to the size of gROI analyzed.

Analysis of large MCEs

The average pair-wise identity between human LMCEs and
other species (Figure 6a) was highest in mammals (99.3 ±
0.0% in chimpanzee, followed by 92.2 ± 3.9% in mouse, 88.5
± 4.2% in rat, and 88.0 ± 4.4% in dog), followed by chicken
(80.0 ± 8.6%), and was lowest in fish (72.4 ± 7.6% in zebra
fish and 71.3 ± 6.5% in puffer fish). Although the average
percent identity of aligned sequence between humans and
other species is high (≥88% in mammals and ≥71% in
nonmammals, excluding indels), the proportion of putative
homologous sites was much more variable (Figure 6b) and
diverged more between mammals and nonmammals (≥93%
in mammals and ≥69% in nonmammals). In mammals the
percentage of well aligned putative homologous sites is higher
on average than the percent identity of the nucleotides within
the homologous sites (97.9 ± 11.0% for chimpanzee, 98.0 ±
7.5% in mouse, 97.4 ± 5.9% in rat, and 96.6 ± 9.0% in dog).
However, for nonmammals the percentage of well aligned
putative homologous sites is on average less than the percent
identity of nucleotides within the homologous sites except in
chicken (80.1 ± 26.0% in chicken, 70.1 ± 30.3% in puffer fish,
and 67.3 ± 31.2% in zebra fish). Thus, the percentage of well
aligned putative homologous sites seems to be directly proportional to the evlolutionary distance to humans which may
suggest that indels become an increasingly important divergence mechanism at longer evolutionary times.

A genome-wide study found that the most highly conserved
elements in vertebrates are hundreds or thousands of bases
long and show extreme levels of conservation [28,42]. Our indepth analysis focused on 88 genes that harbor the longest
504 MCEs (Additional data file 11) ranging from 360 bp (eight
elements from CAMK2G, NCAM1, NLGN1, NRXN1, and

We defined elements as conserved if more than half of their
sequence length exhibited significant site homology to some
subsequence in available vertebrate genomes (Additional
data file 11). Although virtually all (503/504) LMCEs were
conserved in mammals, only 48% (241/504) were conserved

Highly conserved sequences that form RNA secondary structures may participate in the regulation of gene expression,
splicing, cleavage, or post-transcriptional control [45,46]. We
investigated the significance of predicted RNA minimum free
energy (MFE) for MCEs surrounding 150 synaptic genes.
Among 504 LMCEs, we identified 139 significant

These structures were found in and around exons (38/139)

in nonmammals. Among exon-associated elements, 67% (80/
119) were conserved in nonmammals, which decomposed to
97% (35/36), 57% (13/23), and 53%(32/60) for exonic, partial exonic, and UTR LMCEs, respectively. Among elements
associated with UTRs, 68% (26/38) are conserved in the 3'UTR of nonmammals as compared with only 27% (6/22) in
the 5'-UTR, highlighting the relative functional importance of
the 3'-UTR in this set of genes. Among non-exon-associated
elements, 42% (161/385) were conserved in nonmammals. As
fish-mammal genomic comparisons have proved to be powerful in identifying conserved noncoding elements that are
likely to be cis-regulatory in nature [43], we specifically examined elements conserved in fish. Out of all the LMCEs, 21%
(106/504) were conserved in fish with approximately equal
proportions being exon-associated (55/106) and non-exonassociated (51/106).

We found evidence that a subset of LMCEs represent transcribed elements (nonannotated exons of known synaptic
genes or novel transcripts; Additional data file 11). This evidence comes from high-density tiling array data and the
Database of Transcribed Sequences (DoTS) [33]. Expression
data in eight cell lines established by hybridization to highdensity oligonucleotide arrays are available for ten human
chromosomes [44]. There were 148 LMCEs transcribed, and
among these 87% (103/119) of the exon-associated LMCEs
were annotated as transcribed. We confirmed transcription in
all (36/36) exonic and most (56/60) UTR elements. Less than
half (11/23) of the partial exonic LMCEs at intron-exon
boundaries (which by definition have large nontranscribed
intronic portions) were annotated as transcribed. We found
that 45 (out of 385) non-exon-associated LMCEs had evidence for transcription, of which 15 (12 intergenic and 3
intronic) correspond to known genes in other species, and
three intronic elements (EXOC4.381, NLGN1.503, and
SNAP25.168) may be missed exons of their respective
synaptic genes. We also found six intergenic elements that do
not map to any known protein-coding genes (both human and
nonhuman). Only one of these elements shows any protein
coding potential (SYT13.83), suggesting that the rest may be
novel non-protein-coding genes (EXOC5.359, RAB3C.156,
SYN2.235, SYT16.215, and UNC13A.87), one of which
(SYN2.235) identifies transcripts nested antisense to the
known presynaptic gene. Finally, we provide evidence for
transcription for five additional non-exon-associated LMCEs
out of 20 we tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR; Figure 7b).

Discussion

We conducted a comprehensive analysis of sequence conservation patterns in gROIs of 150 genes involved in synaptic
function. This analysis resulted in the identification of a significant number of novel highly conserved sequence elements
that are likely to regulate the expression, translation, or func-

tion of these genes. Our inventory of conserved genomic elements is compiled in the SynapseDB, a database that contains
the genome sequence and expression data for synaptic genes
along with results of comparative sequence analysis reported
here. Among other information, this database includes the

Our results show that exonic dMCEs are enriched for annotated protein domains; within coding sequences, dMCEs may
indicate a 'functional backbone' of a protein, such as transmembrane domains or DNA binding domains. The 1,087
cases of intronic and intergenic dMCEs may represent common regulatory elements of shared trans factors. Indeed, we
found significant enrichment for gene pairs that were overexpressed in brain tissues as well as for gene pairs under
expressed in immune tissues and cells, which indicates that
these noncoding dMCEs may have regulatory potential. Our
findings suggest that these dMCEs arise only in the rare cases
(only 6% of all MCEs) in which the shared conserved elements represent some core function that cannot diverge from
each other in the initial positive selection for new function
because of biophysical or chemical constraints.

refereed research

The analysis of more than 26,000 MCEs identified in our set
of 150 synaptic transmission pathway genes showed that
these sequences are nearly unique and mostly do not represent groups of elements with similar sequence. Nevertheless,
the MCEs showed a more pronounced pattern of similarities
when restricted to genomic regions around paralogous
members of a gene family. Paralogous genes that arise from
gene duplication events often diverge from each other either
because one copy is redundant, and therefore undergoes neutral drift, or because there is selection for new and divergent
function. Paralogs that contain between-species conserved
sequences most likely have experienced positive selection for
new function in an ancestral genome and were subsequently
conserved through purifying selection [53], but such paralogs
are likely to have diverged from each other in the ancestral
genome due to neo-functionalization, subfunctionalization,
or degeneration to pseudogenes [30,31]. Thus, there is no a
priori expectation that paralogous genes will contain MCEs
that are also similar to each other within the same genome.

deposited research

The significant reduction in the rate of synonymous substitutions is unusual and suggests that selective forces act at the
level of the mRNA, such as selection for translational efficiency or accuracy through biased codon usage, selection for
regulation involving the primary transcript such as by
miRNA-type mechanisms, or selection for other primary
transcript function such as binding to RNA binding proteins
(RBPs). We found no difference in the 'effective number of
codons' statistic [50] as a measure of codon bias between presynaptic genes and the genomic survey (data not shown), and
so there is no evidence that presynaptic genes are preferentially selected for translational efficiency or accuracy than
other genes. The reported mechanisms of primary transcript-

reports

Our evolutionary analysis of human-mouse-rat orthologs,
measured by the dN/dS ratio, showed that the average dN/dS
for 139 presynaptic genes is fivefold lower than that of a comprehensive genomic survey of over 15,000 homologous pairs
of human-mouse transcripts (0.072 versus 0.413). This is
consistent with a previous proposal [49] and findings that
brain-specific and neuron-specific proteins are under
stronger purifying selection pressure than genes expressed,
for example, in the liver [24]. The average rate (mean ± standard error) of relative synonymous substitution (dS) for 139
synaptic genes is 0.558 ± 0.016, which represents a statistically significant (P < 0.001), almost fourfold reduction in the
genome-wide average dS. Therefore, the reduced dN/dS ratio
is not due to an increased neutral mutation rate in presynaptic genes. The presynaptic genes are found on almost all
human chromosomes (except chromosome 21), and in 85%
(128/150) of genes the distance to the nearest synaptic gene
exceeds 500 kb. Thus, it is highly unlikely there might be a
chromosomally localized mutational bias specific to presynaptic genes.

dependent regulation (for example, by miRNAs or RBPs) is
too sparsely annotated in the genome to assess whether presynaptic genes may be unusual in this regard. However,
numerous miRNAs are thought to function in neuronal
regulation (for review, see Kosik and Krichevsky [11]), and
many studies have implicated RBPs in regulation of synaptic
function (for review, see Ule and Darnell [51]) in phenomena
such as selective translation of mRNAs at synapses [52] and
brain-specific alternative splicing [12]. In addition, supporting the idea that presynaptic genes are under purifying selection for primary transcripts, we found an unusual number of
potential RNA secondary structures with significant evidence
for stability. The potential for functionally important secondary structure is consistent with the idea that the primary transcripts of the genes involved in synaptic transmission have
important functional significance, either in regulation or in
interaction with RBPs.

elements based on their relative genic position and other

Comparison with ultraconserved elements
Our selection and in-depth sequence analysis of exceptionally
long conserved sequence elements can be compared with the
identification of ultraconserved elements identified by a
genome-wide search for regions longer than 200 bp with
100% identity between the human, mouse, and rat genomes
[42]. LMCEs selected in our study are less perfectly conserved
than ultraconserved elements, exhibiting 80% or greater
pair-wise identity between humans and mammals and 70% or
greater identity between human and nonmammalian
sequences. About 10% (51/504) of our LMCEs are annotated
as non-exon-associated and conserved over the majority of
their length in fish, suggesting a functional basis for their
phylogenetically broad conservation. We found that LMCEs
fall within all three categories relative to annotated genic
structure (exonic, intronic, and intergenic). Several LMCEs
correspond to large exons such as the particularly long exonic
MCEs ranging from 600 to 800 bp in the NLGN family
(NLGN1.667,
NLGN1.668,
NLGN2.37,
NLGN3.61,
NLGN4X.24), and in BSN(.98), EXOC8(.5), PCLO(.119, .162),
and RAB6IP2(.20). We found that 35% (8/23) of partial
exonic LMCEs that span intron-exon boundaries map to
known alternatively spliced exons in CAMK2G, CASK,
NLGN3, NRXN2, RIMS1, and RIMS2. In the case of SNAP25,
the LMCE spans the exon-intron boundaries of two tandemly
arranged exons (Figure 7c). A molecular switch between these
two exons at three weeks of age is important for survival and
synapse remodeling after neural injury [54]. It is striking that
conserved elements surrounding alternatively spliced exons
are also marked as elements with significant thermodynamic
stability for predicted RNA secondary structure. Finally, for
the most abundant class of LMCEs, those in the intergenic
and intronic regions, we provide evidence that they correspond to missed exons of alternative splice forms of two synaptic genes (EXOC4, NLGN1, and SNAP25) and novel
putative non-protein-coding genes around six synaptic genes
(CASK, EXOC5, RAB3C, SYN2, SYT13, and SYT16). The function of these transcribed elements and remaining LMCEs
with no evidence for transcription remains elusive, although
we assume that a high selective pressure may reflect their regulatory or structural roles.

ness [48]. However, in several cases single nucleotide polymorphisms with the strongest association fall within the
intergenic or intronic gene regions [55,56]. Systematic identification and computational analysis of highly conserved elements surrounding these and other synaptic genes can
uncover either an adjacent novel gene or cis-acting polymorphisms resulting in the modulation of synaptic function in
cognition and mental illness. Therefore, we suggest that a
comprehensive comparative analysis may be an essential
complement of genome-wide association studies of complex
diseases.

Materials and methods
Ortholog identification, phylogenetic analysis, and
tests for protein evolution
Orthologs for human gene family members were found using
a combination ENSEMBL's Compara database (v37.35j) and
the best reciprocal BLAST hit procedure, as described by
Tatusov and coworkers [16]. Clustal W [57] was used to align
coding sequence (CDS) from corresponding RefSeq annotations of all transcripts between Homo sapiens (human; May
2004, NCBI Build 35, UCSC hg17), Mus musculus (mouse;
May 2004, NCBI Build 33, UCSC mm5), and Rattus norvegicus (rat; June 2003, Baylor College of Medicine HGSC v3.1,
UCSC rn3). From these multiple alignments, we calculated
the ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous substitutions
(dN/dS) [58] between human-mouse and human-rat pairwise alignments as a measure of selection pressure. dN is the
relative rate of nonsynonymous mutations per nonsynonymous site, whereas dS is the relative rate of synonymous
mutations per synonymous site. Their ratio indicates the
degree of selection pressure. Multiple alignments were also
used for both the neighbor-joining and parsimony methods
for phylogeny reconstruction on 1,000 bootstrap permutations using the MEGA3 program for molecular evolutionary
genetic analysis [59]. The trees shown in Additional data files
2 to 5 are drawn after collapsing branches supported by bootstrap values less than 65%, and each tree is labeled as either
'neighbor-joining' or 'maximum parsimony'.

Comparative analysis pipeline
Noncoding elements, single nucleotide
polymorphisms, and neurologic and psychiatric illness
Comparative sequence analysis and identification of highly
conserved elements in noncoding regions of presynaptic
genes will have immediate application to ongoing human
genetics studies. We believe that such comparative analysis
provides a more comprehensive inventory of genomics elements that are functionally active in a pathway or a compartment such as the synapse. An extended inventory is especially
important in providing functional targets for disease-gene
association studies, which often discover functional variants
in non-protein-coding regions. For example, several proteins
of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor complex have been
linked to cognitive dysfunction or associated with mental ill-

We used genomic sequence from human (May 2004, NCBI
Build 35, UCSC hg17) and gene annotations from RefSeq
(both human and nonhuman), ENSEMBL, and 'known genes'
available via the UCSC Genome Browser database as of 1 May
2006. This set of annotations was used to identify conservatively upstream and downstream regions around 150 presynaptic genes in order to define gROIs. For 11 genes we could
not identify a unique upstream region because an adjacent
nonpresynaptic gene overlapped the beginning of the presynaptic gene, and similarly for 22 genes we could not identify a
unique downstream gene because of overlapping adjacent
nonpresynaptic genes. Furthermore, these multiple gene
annotations were merged into a common annotation such
that inconsistencies were resolved by giving priority to UTRs,

To analyze enrichment of TFBSs within clusters of expressed
genes, for each TFBS we first used a χ2 test to identify TFBSs

refereed research

We searched the MCEs in the human genome for putative
transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) using the 546 vertebrate positional weight matrices (PWMs) in the TRANSFAC
database v8.4 [34]. We identified the putative TFBSs using
our previously described search tool PWM_SCAN [64] with a
P value threshold of 10-5 (we expect a better match once every
10 kb on average in the genome). In order to assess whether
specific TFBSs are enriched in the MCEs near presynaptic
genes, we used as control a length-matched set of MCEs from
the human genome, not overlapping the presynaptic MCEs.
For each presynaptic MCE, we randomly selected 10 regions
of the same length contained in other nonpresynaptic MCEs
in the genome. For each PWM, we randomly select 1,000
samples from the control in which each sample consists of 11 length-matched MCEs. The fraction of 1,000 samples in
which the PWM frequency exceeds that in the presynaptic
MCEs provides an estimate of significance of PWM enrichment in the presynaptic MCEs. We use a P value threshold of
0.002 for enrichment significance, and we filter the enriched
PWMs to ensure that we only report PWMs that are sufficiently distinct from each other.

deposited research

We used BLASTN [32] to conduct a comparison of all 26,000
MCEs with themselves using a significance threshold of E
value ≤ 10-2 after masking all known repeats with RepeatMasker [60]. We refer to the duplicated MCE subsequence comprising significant high scoring BLAST pairs as duplicated
MCE (dMCE) modules. To investigate whether dMCE modules are preserved because of some functional importance, we
compared members of dMCE pairs whose members are in the
same relative genic position with a set of control unique
MCEs (from all gROIs) outside any dMCE pair. While con-

For clustering of significantly regulated genes, we used
Michael Eisen's Cluster v2.11 [61] implementation in the
BioPython 1.42 distribution [62], and we used Java TreeView
1.0.13 [63] to visualize the data. We used expression values
from the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF) data from two replicates across 79 human tissues and cell lines [18] on Affymetrix microarrays, which are
scaled and normalized in the 'GNF Expression Atlas 2' track
from Genome Browser. Although we identified 359 different
probes that overlapped our genes, we excluded 12 probes that
cross-hybridize with paralogs and 56 that detect antisense
transcripts. We clustered 291 unique probe sets that interrogated 144 different genes into five distinct clusters, as
described. Genes were then mapped directly to expression
clusters with most genes assigned to more than one expression cluster. We used dMCEs to define unique pairs of genes
that are in the same expression cluster, and for each cluster
we calculated the binomial probability for the observed
number of gene pairs. When different probesets for the same
gene show divergent results we assume that they interrogate
different splice forms, and treat each probeset as a distinct
transcript (we double count) for statistical consistency.

by which nucleotide substitutions occur at each site in a
genome and how this process changes from one site to the
next [28]. Genome sequence of human (Homo sapiens),
chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), dog (Canis familiaris), mouse
(Mus musculus), rat (Rattus norvegicus), chicken (Gallus
gallus), zebra fish (Danio renio), and puffer fish (Fugu
rubripes) were used to generate alignments. Annotations of
MCEs included transcription from the Database of Transcribed Sequences (DoTS) [33], which clusters public mRNA
and EST data as well as high-density tiling array data (as
described by Cheng and coworkers [44]) available through
the 'Affymetrix Transcriptome Project phase 2' track from
Genome Browser. In addition, we annotated protein domains
from the ENSEMBL core database, coding potential from predicted evolutionarily conserved protein-coding exons from
multiple alignments available through the 'exoniphy human/
mouse/rat/dog' track on Genome Browser, and statistically
significant stable RNA secondary structure as described in
Results, above.

coding sequence (CDS), and intron classes in the order listed;
for example, if a base was annotated as both CDS and UTR,
then it was counted as belonging to the UTR class. This common annotation was used for relative genic characterization
of the MCEs. Broadly, we divide elements into exon-associated elements and non-exon-associated elements. We further
divided exon-associated elements into three putative functional groups: 'exonic', those completely contained within an
exon; 'partial exonic', those that span an intron-exons boundrary; and 'UTR', those that include the 3'-UTR or 5'-UTR
regions. We classified non-exon-associated MCEs into two
subgroups: 'intergenic', those located outside any annotated
gene; and 'intronic', those contained in the intron of an annotated gene. To identify sequence elements with possible novel
regulatory roles, we removed about 3000 exon-associated
MCEs that corresponded to exons of neighboring transcripts
overlapping and in trans to the presynaptic gene, leaving a set
of about 26,000 MCEs on which the analysis is based.

whose relative frequencies across clusters are significantly
different. As we are testing multiple TFBSs, we use a Bonferroni correction [65] at a significance level of α = 0.05. Subsequently, for the five most over-represented TFBSs in each
cluster, we test for statistical significance of by calculating a Z
score for TFBS enrichment. We assume that the relative
enrichment of TFBSs in clusters is normally distributed and
we justify this assumption because the natural log of the relative enrichment (log likelihood) of every TFBS across every
cluster is normal (P < 0.005 by Anderson-Darling test).
Again, when different probes for the same gene fall into divergent expression clusters, we assume that they interrogate different splice forms and treat each probeset as a distinct
transcript and double count for statistical consistency.
Finally, PWM logos generated from equal-length Transfac
hits found within clusters were generated via WebLogo [66]
for all statistically significant cluster-specific enriched TFBSs.

Significant RNA secondary structure
The RNAfold program [67] was used to perform a screen of
secondary structures by calculating the minimal free energy
for all MCEs longer than 50 bp. The minimal free energy for
each MCE was compared with those of 1,000 random permutations of the original sequence to evaluate its potential to
form stable secondary structures by a permutation test.

RT-PCR analysis
RT-PCR analysis was carried out on ABI Prism 7900HT
sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA). Five micrograms of total RNA from multiple tissues were converted to first-strand cDNA using Superscript
II, (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, California 92008,
USA), reverse transcriptase primed using random oligomers.
PCR primers were selected to cover LMCEs. Expression patterns of these LMCEs across tissues was compared with patterns obtained for RT-PCR products generated by priming at
exons upstream and downstream of the LMCE. The PCR
products were visualized by gel electrophoresis.
