Abstract
Background: Polymorphisms at the G72/G30 locus on chromosome 13q have been associated with
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder in more than ten independent studies. Even though the genetic findings are very
robust, the physiological role of the predicted G72 protein has thus far not been resolved. Initial reports
suggested G72 as an activator of D-amino acid oxidase (DAO), supporting the glutamate dysfunction hypothesis
of schizophrenia. However, these findings have subsequently not been reproduced and reports of endogenous
human G72 mRNA and protein expression are extremely limited. In order to better understand the function of
this putative schizophrenia susceptibility gene, we attempted to demonstrate G72 mRNA and protein expression
in relevant human brain regions.
Methods: The expression of G72 mRNA was studied by northern blotting and semi-quantitative SYBR-Green
and Taqman RT-PCR. Protein expression in human tissue lysates was investigated by western blotting using two
custom-made specific anti-G72 peptide antibodies. An in-depth in silico analysis of the G72/G30 locus was
performed in order to try and identify motifs or regulatory elements that provide insight to G72 mRNA
expression and transcript stability.
Results: Despite using highly sensitive techniques, we failed to identify significant levels of G72 mRNA in a variety
of human tissues (e.g. adult brain, amygdala, caudate nucleus, fetal brain, spinal cord and testis) human cell lines
or schizophrenia/control post mortem BA10 samples. Furthermore, using western blotting in combination with
sensitive detection methods, we were also unable to detect G72 protein in a number of human brain regions
(including cerebellum and amygdala), spinal cord or testis. A detailed in silico analysis provides several lines of
evidence that support the apparent low or absent expression of G72.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that native G72 protein is not normally present in the tissues that we analysed
in this study. We also conclude that the lack of demonstrable G72 expression in relevant brain regions does not
support a role for G72 in modulation of DAO activity and the pathology of schizophrenia via a DAO-mediated
mechanism. In silico analysis suggests that G72 is not robustly expressed and that the transcript is potentially labile.
Further studies are required to understand the significance of the G72/30 locus to schizophrenia.

Background
G72 and G30 are overlapping genes transcribed from
opposite strands on chromosome 13q33. They were initially identified within a 65 kb region containing markers
associated with schizophrenia in two independent disease
cohorts [1]. Genetic association between the G72/G30
locus and both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder has
subsequently been reported in several studies and is supported by a recent meta-analysis [2]. Thus, the G72/G30
locus may represent a common susceptibility region for
both disorders. Whilst the combined evidence for association with both disorders can be considered robust, associated alleles are not consistent across studies and there
may not be a distinct haplotype correlated with disease
susceptibility [2].
Multiple transcripts for each gene have been cloned by
reverse transcription-PCR from human brain, spinal cord
and testis cDNA libraries. The longest G72 open reading
frame is predicted to encode a putative 153 amino acid
protein, isolated from amygdala, caudate nucleus, spinal
cord and testis libraries [1]. No homology was found
between any of the putative protein products from the
transcripts of either gene and any known protein. Putative
LG72 orthologues were identified in silico in rhesus monkey and ape genomes leading to the suggestion that it
might represent a rapidly evolving primate-specific gene.
In vitro transcription/translation assays with the cloned
G72 and G30 candidate transcripts yielded a protein
product for LG72 only, which generated a 24-kDa translation product (pLG72) that was reported to localise at the
Golgi apparatus in transiently transfected cells [1]. A more
recent study, however, demonstrated mitochondrial localisation of overexpressed G72 [3]. Yeast two-hybrid screening identified D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) as a putative
protein interactor of pLG72 and recombinant pLG72 was
demonstrated to behave as an activator of DAO in vitro
[1]. On the basis of this observation, which has subsequently not been reproduced [3], G72 has been renamed
D-amino acid oxidase activator (DAOA). DAO catabolises
D-amino acids including D-serine which is a co-agonist at
the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor [4]. As
NMDA receptor hypofunction has been implicated in the
pathophysiology of schizophrenia, the report of a functional interaction between G72 and DAO suggests a pathway whereby G72 could modulate DAO activity, D-serine
levels and NMDA receptor activity and, thus, contribute to
the disease pathology.
To date, however, there have been no convincing reports
of expression of native G72 (or G30) protein and accordingly no confirmation of the G72-DAO interaction in situ.
Moreover, reports of native G72/G30 mRNA expression
are limited. In addition to the original study by Chumakov et al. [1], cDNAs have also been amplified from

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/8/94

human and testis libraries by Hattori et al. [5] although
only after ≥ 40 cycles of PCR. Korostishevsky et al. [6] have
subsequently utilised real-time PCR to detect and quantify
G72 and G30 mRNA in human post-mortem dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex, reporting a tendency towards overexpression of G72 but not G30 transcripts in schizophrenic
versus control brain. In order to learn more about the
potential role of this schizophrenia susceptibility gene, we
have analysed the gene structure and genomic context of
G72/G30 and investigated expression of G72 in human
tissues at the mRNA and protein level.

Methods
Cloning of human G72
Full-length human G72 cDNA (identical to published
GenBank sequence AY138546, which results in the longest predicted protein) was amplified from human testis
Marathon cDNA (Clontech) by nested PCR with forward
primer 5'-GACCCAAAATGCTGGAAAAGCTGAT-3' and
reverse primer 5'-CATCAGAAGGATTGGCTGGGAAGAAT-3' and cloned into pCDNA3.2/GW/D-TOPO. In
order to obtain N-terminally epitope-tagged G72 in mammalian expression vectors, G72 cDNA was PCR-amplified
from above template vector with forward primer 5'-CACCATGCTGGAAAAGCTGATGGGTGC-3'
and
reverse
primer
5'-TCATTCAGCTTTGGTAGAAGTTATTTCCTTGTGG-3'. The PCR product was cloned into pENTR/DTOPO entry vector using pENTR Directional TOPO Cloning Kit (Invitrogen), following manufacturer's instructions. Resulting entry clones were used in LR
recombination reactions (Invitrogen) with pDEST26 (Invitrogen) and pDEST12.2-FLAG (kind gift from Jan Kopf)
Gateway destination vector, to obtain G72 cDNA in frame
with the respective N-terminal epitope tag (6 × His or
FLAG-tag).
Cell culture and transient transfection
HEK-293 cells were cultured in Minimum Essential
Medium (MEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum and non-essential amino acids (Gibco) at 37°C
and 10% CO2. Cells were transiently transfected using
Fugene-6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were plated one day before transfection at 4 ×
106 cells per 10 cm-plate, transfected with 5–7 μg plasmid
DNA and incubated with transfection mix (complex of
plasmid-DNA and Fugene 6 at a ratio of 1:3) for ~40 h
prior to preparation of protein lysates.
RNA isolation and Northern Analysis of G72 mRNA
Total RNA was isolated from HEK-293 cells (mock-transfected or overexpressing His-G72) using the Qiagen RNeasy protocol, according to manufacturer's instructions.
The optional on-column DNase digestion step was performed using the Qiagen RNase-free DNase set. RNA was

eluted in 40 μl of RNAse-free water and quantified using a
spectrophotometer.
For northern gels, 10 μg total RNA in NorthernMax Formaldehyde sample buffer (Ambion) were loaded per lane.
Northern blotting was performed as described in
"Promega protocols and applications guide", third edition (1996). Briefly, a formaldehyde-containing 1.2%
agarose gel was prepared in 1× MOPS buffer. The gel was
run in 1× MOPS buffer at 5 V/cm with regular buffer mixing. After completion, the gel was washed three times for
10 min in RNAse-free dH2O, soaked 15 min in 0.05 M
NaOH, neutralised 15 min in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5
and soaked for 30 min in 20× SSC before capillary transfer
(over-night) onto Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham). RNA was UV-crosslinked to the membrane (UV
Stratalinker) and dried for at least 2 h prior to further use.
Northern blots were probed with a 390 bp NotI-XbaI fragment of G72 cDNA (corresponding to G72 clone
AY138546 cDNA without the last 3'-terminal 85 nucleotides) or with beta-actin control probe (BD Biosciences).
Probes were 32P-dCTP-labelled using Rediprime II Random Prime Labelling System (Amersham) according to
manufacturer's instructions and purified with spin columns (Amersham). Prehybridisation and probe hybridisation were performed with Rapid-hyb buffer
(Amersham) at 70°C, according to manufacturer's
instructions. Stringency washes were performed according
to the Rapid-hyb protocol (Amersham). Briefly, membranes were washed for 20 min at room temperature in
washing buffer 1 (2× SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS) and twice for
15 min at 65°C in washing buffer 2 (0.1× SSC, 0.1% (w/
v) SDS). Signals were detected using a sensitive phosphorimager (Typhoon Trio, Amersham), with exposure
times between 2 h and over-night.
Alternatively, commercial human brain multiple tissue
Northern (MTN) blots (Clontech/BD Biosciences MTN
blot II and blot V) were used for analysis of G72 expression in human brain. Blots (nylon membrane) contained
approximately 2 μg of poly A+ RNA per lane from eight
(MTN blot II) or six (MTN blot V) different brain regions.
Hybridisation conditions were essentially as described
above, but less stringent conditions (washing buffer 2 at
55°C instead of 65°C) and longer exposure times of up to
three days (phosphorimager, Typhoon Trio, Amersham)
were used in order to detect even weak signals. Following
G72 probing, membranes were stripped with boiling
0.5% SDS and reprobed with a beta-actin-probe to test for
equal loading and good RNA quality.
Alternatively to radioactive labelling, northern blots were
probed with biotinylated dCTP, using the "SpotLight Random Primer Labeling Kit" according to manufacturer's

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/8/94

instructions (BD Biosciences, Clontech). Hybridisation
and chemiluminescent detection were carried out using
the "SpotLight Chemiluminescent Hybridisation and
Detection Kit" (BD Biosciences, Clontech). This method
appeared to be less sensitive compared to radioactive
detection.
Real-time RT-PCR
Five different primer sets were designed within G72 exons
that are common to most G72 splice variants (Exons 2, 4
and 7). Sequences are shown in table 1; G72 #2 corresponds to the primer pair used by Korostishevsky et al. [6].
All primer sets were tested by SYBR Green PCR (and TaqMan PCR, if applicable) on human genomic DNA (Clontech; 0.1 ng – 0.1 μg per reaction), human adult total
brain, amygdala, testis and fetal brain cDNA (Marathon
Ready cDNA, Clontech; 0.1 – 0.5 ng cDNA per reaction)
and cDNA from HEK-293 cells overexpressing recombinant His-G72 cDNA (see below). Total RNA was isolated from HEK-293 cells (mock-transfected or
overexpressing His-G72) as described above. Samples
were reverse transcribed (in triplicate) into cDNA using
the Omniscript RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). Briefly, for each 20
μl reverse transcription reaction, 300 ng RNA in a total
volume of 12 μl was added to 8 μl RT-PCR mastermix
(final concentrations/amounts: 1 μM Oligo-dT primer
(Invitrogen), 0.5 mM each dNTP, 1× RT Buffer, 10 units
RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen), and 4 units Omniscript
Reverse Transcriptase). Negative controls were prepared as
above, but without Reverse Transcriptase. Reactions were
incubated for 60 min at 37°C. The masterplate was aliquoted into 20 optical 96-well plates using the Hydra-96
robot (Robbins Scientific, GRI). Taqman PCR was performed using an ABI 7700 Sequence Detection system (PE
Applied Biosystems) as previously described [7]. Briefly,
the PCR reaction mastermix contained a final concentration of 200 nM of each of the forward and reverse primers
(see table 1; Invitrogen), 200 nM FAM-TAMRA probe
(Qiagen, Operon), and 1× Quantitect master mix (Qiagen). For SYBR Green chemistry, 1× SYBR Green mastermix (Perkin Elmer) was used, and no probe was added to
the reaction. The PCR amplification was performed for 40
cycles, consisting of 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 10 min, 40
cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min. Standards
were analysed on each plate using dilutions of genomic
DNA. All measurements were performed in triplicate. The
housekeeping gene cyclophilin was run as a control to
ensure comparable amounts of cDNA in all wells. Ct values were converted into arbitrary units according to manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems).
Generation of rabbit polyclonal antibodies against G72
Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated by Cambridge Research Biochemicals (Billingham, UK) against
two peptides within the predicted G72 variant AY138546

peptide VTRKEGWKRRHEDGY-acid, with an N-terminal
cysteine added for coupling; antibodies #1412 and
#1413: antigenic peptide SKDRRQPLERMWTC-amide).
Crude antisera were purified by affinity chromatography
on Thiopropyl Sepharose 6B derivatised with the antigen.
The concentration of purified antibodies in glycine eluates
was as follows: #1410: 1.69 mg/ml, #1411: 0.96 mg/ml,
#1412: 0.64 mg/ml and #1413: 0.33 mg/ml.
Preparation of protein lysates
Transfected HEK-293 cells were washed twice with cold
PBS and lysed in 500 μl – 1 ml ice-cold Triton-X-100 lysis
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5% Glycerol, 1% Triton-X-100, supplemented with "Complete"
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)) per 10 cm-plate. Samples were
rotated for 15 min at 4°C and centrifuged 20 min at 14
000 g, 4°C. Supernatants were stored in aliquots at -80°C.

Rat tissue was dissected from embryonic, young or adult
rat (CD, Charles River), ground to a powder in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Total protein lysates were
prepared from tissue powder using RIPA lysis buffer (50
mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% NaDeoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, supplemented with "Complete"
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)). Samples were tip sonicated
briefly, rotated at 4°C for 15 minutes and centrifuged for
20 min at 14 000 g, 4°C. Supernatants were collected and

protein concentration was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce Biotechnology).
Immunoprecipitation
Cell lysates from transiently transfected HEK-293 cells
were prepared as described above, using 750 μl to 1 ml
Triton-X-100 lysis buffer per 10 cm plate. Supernatants
were incubated with 3 μg of anti-G72 antibody (#1410 or
#1411) for 2 h at 4°C, followed by incubation with protein-G-sepharose (Sigma) for another 2 h at 4°C. Immunocomplexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and
once with 1× TBS before elution with 40 μl of 2× Laemmli
loading buffer containing β-Mercaptoethanol. Eluates
were analysed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as
described below.
SDS-PAGE and Western blotting
Total lysates from transfected HEK-293 cells (lysate preparation see above; 10 – 20 μg total protein per well), rat
tissue lysates (40 – 50 μg per well) or human protein medleys (50 μg per well; Clontech/BD Biosciences: SDS-solubilised proteins prepared from whole human tissues,
prepared under conditions designed to ensure maximal
representation of tissue-specific proteins) were separated
on 4–20% Novex Tris-Glycine gels (Invitrogen). Proteins
were transferred to nitrocellulose (Amersham) or PVDF
(Millipore) membrane by wet-blotting. For conventional
Western analysis, membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk powder in TBST (25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM
NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature, incu-

bated overnight at 4°C with primary antibody (anti-G72
#1410, #1411, #1412 or #1413 at 1–5 μg/ml; anti-His H15, goat polyclonal antibody, Santa Cruz, at 0.5 μg/ml;

1:20 000 dilution) in blocking buffer, washed five times
in TBST, incubated with goat-anti-rabbit-IgG-POD (Santa
Cruz, 1:10 000 in blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature, washed again and developed using the ECL Plus
(Amersham), ECL Advance (Amersham) or Visualizer
(Upstate) detection system. Alternatively, Western analysis was performed using the LI-COR Odyssey® Infrared
Imaging System. Experiments were performed according
to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, proteins were separated as described above alongside Odyssey pre-stained
molecular weight markers (Licor, fluorescence in 700 nm
channel) and transferred onto PVDF membrane (Millipore) by wet blotting. Membranes were blocked with
Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR), diluted 1:1 with 1 ×
PBS. For primary antibody incubations, the blocking
buffer was supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20, and for
secondary antibody incubations, 0.1% Tween-20 and
0.01% SDS were added. Primary antibody concentrations
and incubation times were as described above. Blots were
washed five times with PBST (1 × PBS, 0.1% Tween-20)
prior to a 1 h incubation (room temperature, protected
from light) with secondary antibodies (IRDye800CW
goat-anti-rabbit, LI-COR, 1:10 000; Alexa Fluor® 680 donkey-anti-goat, Molecular Probes 1:15 000). Membranes
were washed again and visualised with LI-COR Odyssey®
Infrared Imaging System (700 nm and 800 nm channels).

Bioinformatics methods
Sequence information
Gene sequence information was obtained from the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
Genbank database. Variants AY138546 and AY138548
were used to represent G72 and G30 respectively. In early
2007, NCBI replaced AY138456 with a longer sequence,
NM_172370.3, which is extended at the 5'UTR by 228 bp.
This study will refer to AY138546 as the G72 variant; however, analyses have been repeated on NM_172370.3 for
completeness.

Immunocytochemistry
HEK-293 cells were seeded on 13 mm glass coverslips
(coated with poly-D-lysine, Sigma), transiently transfected with FLAG-G72 or His-G72 cDNA and fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.2) for 15 min at
room temperature 36 h post-transfection. Cells were
blocked for 1 h at room temperature using PBS with 0.1%
Triton X-100, 10% normal goat serum (NGS) and 1%
bovine serum albumin (BSA). Following one wash with
1× PBS, cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies in PBS with 5% NGS and 0.5% BSA. Rabbit polyclonal anti-G72 #1410 was used at a
concentration of 3 μg/ml, #1411 at 5 μg/ml and antiFLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at 0.3 μg/
ml. After four 10 min washes with 1× PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor®488
goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor®594 goat anti-mouse
IgG at 5 μg/ml (Molecular Probes). Cells were washed
four times with 1× PBS, mounted with ProLong® Gold
antifade reagent (Molecular Probes) and analysed using
an Olympus microscope and Image-Pro Plus imaging
software (MediaCybernetics).

Identification of Functional motifs
Secondary structure elements and previously identified
motifs present in a number of motif databases were
scanned for using the protein sequences of G72 and G30.
Twelve structure predictions were performed including
transmembrane helix prediction TMHMM [14], and prediction/location of signal sequences SignalP [15]. Six
motif databases were searched including a database of
protein motif regular expressions and profiles PROSITE
[16] and a database of protein fingerprints, each fingerprint usually consisting of multiple motifs PRINTS [17].

G72 gene environment
The region around G72 was assessed using the UCSC
human genome browser (March 2006; NCBI build 36.1).
All known genes (with a Genbank RefSeq transcript) in a
specified region can be displayed using this viewer.
Identification of Promoter regions
Promoters were predicted for G72 and G30 by collating
and analysing results from several promoter prediction
programs. Each of the features predicted by the programs
adds a layer of confidence to the promoter prediction. The
programs report CpG rich regions using EMBOSS newcpgseek (threshold CpG score of 17) & cpgplot, and CpGProD [1,8,9], nucleosomal binding sites using recon [10],
transcription start sites using eponine [11], human transfac transcription factor site clusters using Cister [12], and
EMBOSS matrix/scaffold attachment regions using
marscan [13].

EST searches
An extensive EST search was carried out using BlastN run
through the following subsets of Genbank: Genbank EST,
Genbank cDNA Genbank Human EST and Genbank Rat
EST against more than fifteen species. The default BLAST
Expectation thresholds used were lowered to 100 to show
weaker matches. In addition, using the NCBI blast tool,
G72 (both AY138546 and NM_172370.3) and G30 transcript sequences were run through BLASTN against all of
the available EST and cDNA databases.

Ortholog searches
To search for evidence of G72 or G30 orthologues, several
Genbank databases were searched. The nucleotide transcripts sequences were run through BLASTN against all the
(more than fifteen) species specific EST and cDNA GenBank subdivisions. The protein sequences were run
through BLASTP against fourteen species specific GenBank protein databases. The sequences were also run
through BLASTN against over fifteen general primate and
rodent genomic sequence databases.
Identification of RNA instability motifs
The G72 UTRs were searched for predicted AU-rich elements (AREs) using the motif ATTTA [18].
Identification of miRNAs
Two miRNA prediction methods, miRANDA [19] and
RNA hybrid [20] were run on the G72 transcripts to search
for evidence that the gene is regulated by miRNAs. The
thresholds for free energy of binding for miRANDA was 15, and RNA hybrid is -25. P values for both methods
were < = 0.05.
Gene prediction
All of the gene prediction algorithms available as tracks in
the UCSC (May 2004 version, NCBI build 35) were run
on G72 and G30 sequences. The majority of the methods
used to predict genes are based on gene models reconstructed solely from mRNA and EST evidence. Therefore
in this analysis we have focused on prediction methods
that also use evidence from other sources.

N-SCAN [21] combines biological-signal modelling in the
target genome sequence along with information from a
multiple-genome alignment to generate de novo gene predictions. Gene predictions were taken from the SGP program, which predicts genes using mouse/human
homology [22]. The exoniphy program identifies evolutionarily conserved protein-coding exons in a multiple
alignment using a phylogenetic hidden Markov model
phylo-HMM [23], a statistical model that simultaneously
describes exon structure and exon evolution. Retrogenes
are predicted by showing processed mRNAs that have
been inserted back into the genome since the mouse/
human split [24]. RetroGenes can be either functional
genes that have acquired a promoter from a neighboring
gene, non-functional pseudogenes, or transcribed pseudogenes. The ExonWalk program merges cDNA evidence
together to predict full length isoforms, including alternative transcripts. The Vertebrate Genome Annotation
(VEGA) database build 30 is designed to be a central
repository for manual annotation of different vertebrate
finished genome sequence [25]. Finished genomic
sequence is analysed on a clone by clone basis using a
combination of similarity searches against DNA and pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/8/94

tein databases as well as a series of ab initio gene predictions using GENSCAN [26]. In addition, comparative
analysis using vertebrate datasets such as the Riken mouse
cDNAs and Genoscope Tetraodon nigroviridis Ecores (Evolutionary Conserved Regions) are used for novel gene discovery.
The coding region of the chimpanzee G72 was predicted
from chimpanzee genomic sequence, using human G72
protein sequence (NP_758958) as a template and the
GENEWISE gene prediction tool [27].

A G72-specific 390 bp probe was isolated by restriction
digest from G72 cDNA clone AY138546 (plasmid HisG72, see methods), radioactively labelled and validated
using northern blot membranes containing total RNA
from HEK-293 cells overexpressing His-G72 (10 μg total
RNA per lane). As shown in Figure 1A, a strong and specific signal was seen in His-G72 overexpressing cells, but
not in mock-transfected cells. RNA from both His-G72
and mock-transfected cells showed a strong beta-actin signal (Fig. 1A, right). We next sought to investigate expression of G72 mRNA across a variety of human CNS
regions, using Clontech MTN (Multiple Tissue Northern)
human brain blots. The northern membranes contained 2
μg of poly A+ mRNA per lane, a quantity that should
allow detection of rare messages. Probes were radioactively labelled, since initial experiments had shown a
lower sensitivity of non-radioactively labelled probes
(data not shown). In order to increase the probability of
detecting potentially low levels of G72, washing conditions were kept at a low stringency (see Methods), and
phosphorimager exposure times were increased to up to
three days. Whereas a strong G72 signal was visible after 2
– 12 hours on the validation blots (Fig. 1A), no G72
mRNA was detected in any of the CNS regions tested, even
after very long exposure times (Fig. 1B). These results were
unexpected, since CNS regions represented on Clontech
human brain blots II and V included amygdala (lane 14),
caudate nucleus (lane 13) and spinal cord (lane 5), i.e.
regions from which G72 has previously been cloned [1].
Lane 8 contained mRNA from cerebellum, a region that
might be expected to express G72 if its role was indeed
regulation of D-amino acid oxidase which is expressed at
highest levels in this brain region [28,29]. However, this
brain region was also devoid of detectable G72 mRNA. In
order to control for RNA integrity and similar RNA loading in all lanes, G72-probed northern membranes were
stripped and reprobed with a beta-actin probe. As shown
in Fig. 1C, a strong actin signal was observed after short
exposure times (2 – 6 hours). Thus, G72 levels in all brain
regions investigated are below the detection limit of
northern analysis.

Investigation of G72 expression by northern analysis
Investigation of G72 expression by northern analysis. (A) G72 and β-actin probes were validated using total RNA isolated from mock-transfected HEK-293 cells (M) or cells expressing His-G72 (G72). A strong signal for G72 was only observed
in cells expressing His-G72. (B) Using a G72-specific, radioactive probe, no G72 signal was detected on Clontech poly A+ RNA
Northern blots. The following brain regions were represented: Human Brain Blot II: 1, putamen. 2, temporal lobe. 3, frontal
lobe. 4, occipital pole. 5, spinal cord. 6, medulla. 7, cerebral cortex. 8, cerebellum. Human Brain blot V: 9, thalamus. 10, whole
brain. 11, hippocampus. 12, corpus callosum. 13, caudate nucleus. 14, amygdala. (C) Following G72-probing, human brain blots
II and V were stripped and reprobed with a β-actin-specific probe in order to ensure RNA integrity and equal loading. Signal
strength was similar in all lanes.

Analysis of G72 mRNA expression in brain using SYBRGreen and Taqman RT-PCR
In an attempt to employ a more sensitive detection
method, we used real-time semiquantitative RT-PCR to
analyse expression levels of G72 in human tissues and cell
lines. Five primer sets (see table 1 in Methods) were
designed within G72 exons that are common to most G72
splice variants (exons 2, 4 and 7; see Fig. 2B), including
one primer pair (#2) previously used by Korostishevsky et
al. [6]. Primer design within exons, rather than across
exon-intron boundaries, allowed validation of primer sets
using human genomic DNA (see Fig. 3). However, as the
small size of all exons limited the possibilities for primer
and probe design, SYBR Green chemistry (primer sets #2,
#3 and #4) was used as an alternative to TaqMan RT-PCR
(primer sets #1 and #5). The G72 genomic context, gene
structure and positions of PCR primers and probes are
shown in Fig. 2.

As shown in Fig. 3A, all five primer sets gave a robust signal on human genomic DNA. No signal was obtained
using rat genomic DNA (data not shown), proving specificity of the primers for human G72, as the rat genome
does not contain a G72 gene (see below, and [1]). However, none of the primer pairs detected significant levels of
G72 mRNA in human cDNA from brain, testis, spinal

cord or amygdala, i.e. regions from which G72 has reportedly been cloned. In addition, no G72 amplification
could be achieved in cDNA from human fetal brain
(Clontech) or in more than ten different human cell lines.
Since it has previously been suggested that G72 might be
upregulated in schizophrenic brain [6], we also investigated G72 expression in a carefully selected set of human
post-mortem brain BA10 samples from more than 25
schizophrenic patients and matched controls (Charing
Cross Hospital Prospective Collection). No expression of
G72 mRNA could be detected in either control or schizophrenic brain (random hexamer primed cDNA: data not
shown). This result is in contradiction to a previously
published report [6], but is consistent with other unreported results (e.g. Dr. Phil Burnet, University of Oxford:
personal communication using the Stanley Foundation
Samples).
In order to verify that our primer sets were able to amplify
G72 from cDNA, and not only from genomic DNA, we
prepared cDNA from HEK-293 cells expressing a Histagged version of the longest G72 ORF, the coding region
of variant AY138546 (His-G72). Only primer sets within
exon 2 and 4 (#1, #3, #4) were expected to give a signal
using His-G72 cDNA. The reverse primers of primer sets in
exon 7 (#2 and #5) were designed to anneal to the

untranslated 3'-UTR region which was not contained
within our expression plasmid. However, the 3'-UTR is
reportedly present within the splice variants described in
GenBank and thus primer sets in exon 7 were expected to
work on human cDNA samples. As shown in Fig. 3B,
primer sets within exons 2 and 4 readily amplified G72
cDNA from G72-overexpressing cells, thus confirming
that our primers were able to detect G72 cDNA when
mRNA is expressed at appreciable levels. Real-time semiquantitative PCR is a highly sensitive technique that we
and others have previously used to amplify rare messages.
Our results therefore suggest that endogenous expression
levels in adult human total brain, testis, spinal cord, amygdala, BA10, or human fetal brain are below the detection
limit for TaqMan/SYBR Green PCR and must thus be
extremely low, if present.
Generation and validation of G72 antibodies
Four antibodies against two G72 peptides were raised in
rabbits. Anti-G72 #1410 and #1411 were directed against
amino acids 55–69, #1412 and #1413 against amino
acids 119–132 of the predicted G72 variant AY138546
protein, pLG72. Antibodies were validated using western

blotting and immunoprecipitation. N-terminally Histagged G72 (His-G72) was overexpressed in HEK-293
cells and total protein lysates or eluates from immunoprecipitation reactions were analysed by western blotting,
using mock-transfected cells as a control. As shown in Fig.
4A, both #1410 and #1411 readily detected His-G72 in
cell lysates (lane 2), but showed no specific signal in
mock-transfected cells (lane 1). The apparent molecular
weight (Mw) of His-G72 was ~22 kDa, which is similar to
the observed Mw of in vitro translated G72 (~24 kDa, [1])
and slightly heavier than the predicted Mw of ~18 kDa.
The observed size difference is likely to be due to the
epitope tag. Several lower molecular weight bands were
observed and are likely to be degradation products of HisG72, since they were detected by anti-G72 antibodies but
not seen in mock lysates. Both antibodies also immunoprecipitated His-G72 from cell lysates, as shown for antibody #1411 (Fig. 4, lanes 4; analogous data for
immunoprecipitation with #1410 not shown). In order to
demonstrate that the observed protein at ~22 kDa was
indeed His-tagged G72, membranes were probed with
anti-G72 and anti-His antibodies and visualised using LICOR Odyssey® Infrared Imaging System, which allows

Fig. 4B (lane 2), the anti-G72 antibody #1410 (green) and
a commercial anti-His antibody (red) detected the same
bands in total protein lysates from HEK-293 cells overexpressing His-G72 (merged image in yellow). Analogous
results were obtained using antibody #1411 (data not
shown).
Antibodies #1410 and #1411 were also validated for
immunocytochemistry. Both polyclonal antibodies specifically stained G72-transfected, but not mock-transfected HEK-293 cells. G72 showed a mainly punctate
expression pattern (Additional File 1), which is typical for
mitochondrial proteins and which paralleled the subcellular G72 localisation recently described by Kvajo et al.
[3]. Antibodies #1412 and #1413 did not yield a specific
signal in western blotting or immunocytochemistry experiments and did not bind G72 in IP reactions. Therefore,
only antibodies #1410 and #1411 were used in future
experiments.

sciences, Clontech) from seven different CNS regions (spinal cord, amygdala, cerebellum, frontal lobe, fetal brain,
hippocampus, temporal lobe) and testis. His-G72-containing lysates were used as a positive control in all experiments. In order to detect even weak signals, a variety of
very sensitive detection reagents as well as LI-COR Odyssey® Infrared Imaging was used. Representative results are
shown in Fig. 5. No specific signal for endogenous G72
was observed at the expected molecular weight of ~18 kDa
with either of the previously validated antibodies, antiG72 #1410 and #1411. An unspecific band just above 50
kDa was observed with #1411 in all human CNS samples
(lanes 3, 5, 6, 7, 8), but not in testis (lane 4) or rat brain
(lane 9). A very weak band, the visibility of which could
be increased through scanning at higher intensity (analogous to longer exposure times), was observed at around
15 kDa (i.e. below the expected size for human G72) in
testis (lane 4), cerebellum (lane 6) and fetal brain (lane
8), but not in spinal cord, amygdala, frontal lobe or rat
cortex.

was not detected using antibody #1411. Furthermore, a
signal at the same size was also observed in rat cortex,
although rodent species do not possess a G72 orthologue,
thus making it unlikely that the observed signal in fetal
brain represented endogenous G72.
Taken together, our western blotting experiments with a
range of sensitive detection methods did not detect native
G72 protein in a variety of human brain regions (including cerebellum and amygdala), spinal cord or testis.
In silico analysis of G72 transcription
We performed a detailed in silico analysis of the G72/G30
locus to try and identify known motifs and regulatory elements that may give some insight into our inability to
detect any G72 expression. As reported previously, the
genomic region around G30 and G72 is devoid of genes
with the nearest neighbouring known gene located 948 kb
upstream (EFNB2) and over 2 Mb downstream
(SLC10A2) of AY138546 (Fig. 2A). The G72 gene contains
eight exons (Fig. 2B); the G72 splice variant AY138546

spans 24.8 kb and NM_172370.3 spans 25.0 kb. G72 is
antisense to G30 (putative protein 10.4 kD) and
AY138548, which represents the longest G30 variant,
spans 47 kb.
In silico promoter prediction was performed on the
genomic region spanning 5 kb upstream and 0.5 kb
downstream of the gene transcriptional start site (TSS) of
the G72 variant AY138546. This revealed a weak Cister
peak (see Methods) indicating human transcription factor
site clusters about 0.7 kb upstream of the TSS but no other
prominent promoter features, such as CpG islands or cognate transcription factor binding sites which are often
seen when a canonical promoter is present. However,
there were some features consistent with a functional promoter (based on the prediction of CpG rich regions by the
EMBOSS newcpgseek program, transcription factor site
clusters by Cister and matrix/scaffold attachment regions
by marscan) in the region 3.5 kb upstream of the TSS,
although an EST database search revealed no ESTs (see
below) or mRNAs that extended exon 1 of the G72 transcript 3.5 kb upstream. Although it is still possible that the

regulatory region is located 3.5 kb upstream of G72 or
that the G72 promoter is atypical, our analysis does not
support the presence of a robust promoter.
In order to analyse G72 expression, a comprehensive EST
database search was performed using all G72 variants.
This failed to detect any significant G72 ESTs in any of the
species (more than fifteen) searched providing no supporting evidence of expression. Furthermore, using
human mRNA and protein G72 sequences along with predicted primate G72 protein sequences, searches of Pan
troglodytes (chimpanzee), Macaca mulatta (rhesus monkey), Macaca fascicularis (cynomolgus monkey) and several other primate databases did not detect any ESTs or
non human mRNAs or proteins. This strongly suggests no
expression of G72 in these species in the tissues represented in the EST databases (or that it is only expressed in
very specific libraries). Difficulties in detecting substantial
G72 expression could potentially be accounted for by
unstable mRNA species. The RNA instability motif search
run on the G72 UTRs predicts one ATTTA motif in the
5'UTR of G72. These motifs are generally found in unstable mammalian mRNA UTRs and represent the most
widespread and efficient determinant of RNA instability
among those characterized in mammalian cells, marking
RNAs for rapid destruction unless protected [30].

The G72 transcript sequence was also analysed by two
miRNA prediction programs in order to investigate if it
could be regulated by miRNAs. Using both methods, two
(hsa-mir-600 and hsa-mir-196a-2) miRNAs predicted to
bind to the 3'UTR (exon 7a and 8 of G72, see Figure 5B,
corresponding to the 4th and 5th exon of the AY138546
variant) were identified. Although these programs predict
miRNA target sites, the binding of the miRNAs to G72
would depend on other factors. For example, both the
miRNA and transcript must be expressed in the same tissue at the same time and the folding of the mRNA UTR
could affect accessibility of the miRNA to the binding site.
For this reason it would be important to experimentally
confirm these in silico predictions.

Discussion
The G72/30 locus has received considerable attention due
to replicated disease association data for schizophrenia
and bipolar disorder. Furthermore, it has been proposed
that the G72 peptide is a direct modulator of DAO activity
and as such has mechanistic relevance to schizophrenia.
In order to better understand the function of G72, we
investigated expression of both the G72 mRNA and putative protein in a series of human CNS and peripheral tissue samples. We were unable to detect the G72 message

BMC Psychiatry 2008, 8:94

using either Taqman or northern analysis (13 brain
regions) in any of our human tissue samples including
cerebral cortex, amygdala, caudate nucleus, spinal cord
and testis, i.e. tissues from which G72 had previously
been cloned [1,5]. We also analysed over 25 control and
25 schizophrenic patient BA10 samples and could not
detect the G72 transcript in the control or disease samples.
Furthermore, we generated two specific and sensitive antibodies to a G72 peptide (amino acids 55–69 of LG72).
Although the recombinant protein was readily detected by
western blotting and immunocytochemistry, native protein was not observed in different tissues reportedly
expressing G72.
Several gene detection methods that combine DNA/protein database searches and comparative analysis of conserved vertebrate DNA sequences predict the G72 gene at
the locus on human chromosome 13q.33. Our in silico
analysis, however, indicates that the G72 gene lacks features of a robustly transcribed gene and moreover contains an instability sequence that is generally found in
unstable mammalian mRNAs [31]. There is also evidence
for the presence of miRNA cognate sites, which regulate
the expression of target genes by binding to their mRNAs
[20]. These findings suggest that the G72 transcript may
be rapidly removed if or when it is expressed. Furthermore, endogenous RNA interference between G72 and
G30 (which is transcribed in the opposite direction) may
also account for very low or no detectable expression, as
suggested previously [2].
There is some evidence that G72 is only present in higher
primates and not in rodent species [1]. Extensive genomic
sequence analysis identifies some regions of homology to
human G72 in Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee), Gorilla gorilla
(gorilla), Pongo pygmaeus (orangutan), Hylobates sp. (gibbon), Macaca mulatta (rhesus monkey) and Callithrix jacchus (marmoset) genomic sequences. There are, however,
no full-length primate orthologues and for example, there
are two stop codons in the predicted chimpanzee G72
transcript sequence, suggesting this could in fact be a
pseudogene and furthermore that AY138546 (and
NM_172370.3) is unique to humans.
Although we (and others: Dr. Phil Burnet, University of
Oxford, personal communication) have been unable to
detect G72 mRNA, it has been possible to clone G72 from
several libraries [1,3,5]. Indeed, we have cloned G72
cDNA from a testis cDNA library, but nevertheless failed
to detect appreciable levels of G72 from the same testis
cDNA sample using TaqMan or SYBR Green RT-PCR.
Since these methods can detect tens of copies of a gene,
expression levels below this detection limit are indicative
of either no expression within any of the investigated tis-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/8/94

sues, or of an extremely localised or tightly regulated
expression.
A significant percentage of human mRNA transcripts are
either not polyadenylated or are bimorphic [32].
Although we failed to detect G72 transcripts in polyadenylated mRNA samples (northern analysis; real-time semiquantitative RT PCR analysis using cDNA from cell lines
or Clontech "Marathon Ready cDNA") we also did not
detect G72 transcripts in the human post mortem samples
that were prepared with random hexamers, which
excludes the possibility that our analysis may have failed
to detect G72 transcripts based on the method of cDNA
synthesis from isolated RNA. A possible reason why e.g.
Korostishevsky et al. [6] observed a G72 PCR product may
be explained by the apparent lack of sample treatment to
eliminate contaminating genomic DNA and the absence
of RT minus PCR controls for signal detection. We used
the same primer pair as described by that group (primer
set #2) and furthermore confirmed activity on genomic
DNA (Fig. 3). It would seem likely therefore that the discrepancy between that study and our study (and others)
might be explained by amplification from contaminating
genomic DNA.
It should be noted that a recent study also reports difficulty in identifying native G72 protein and failed to replicate the proposed modulation of DAO activity [3]. The
authors claim, however, to detect the native protein in a
small (0.01%) sub-population of HeLa cells and in the
membrane fraction of human amygdala. We have also
analysed G72 expression (mRNA and protein) in the
human amygdala and found no detectable G72 present.
The antibody generated in the present study is very similar
to that described by Kvajo et al. [3] in that we used the
same epitope to generate the antibody and the cellular
localisation of recombinant G72 is also punctuate/tubular rather that Golgi-restricted as suggested by Chumakov
et al. [1] (Additional File 1). We also detected recombinant G72 by western analysis but not the native protein
in tissue or cell extracts. When combining a very sensitive
western blot detection method and long exposure times, a
signal at around 20 kDa, i.e. just above the expected size
of human G72 (18 kDa) was detected in human fetal
brain lysate (Additional File 2). However, this signal was
only observed with one of our two validated anti-G72
antibodies and a signal at the same apparent molecular
weight was also detected in brain lysates from rat, which
does not have a G72 gene, thus making it highly unlikely
that this band represents G72. These results highlight the
importance of suitable negative controls, as well as the
danger of potentially misinterpreting bands if technical
limits of the method are pushed (e.g. through loading of
large protein quantities, long exposure times and high
antibody concentration).

While further studies are required to understand the significance of the G72/30 locus to schizophrenia, we propose that if native G72 protein exists at all, it is expressed
at such low levels that any physiological role is called in
to question. We also conclude that the lack of demonstrable G72 expression in relevant brain regions does not support a role for G72 protein in modulation of DAO activity
and the pathology of schizophrenia via a DAO-mediated
mechanism. Following the original proposal for a direct
G72 and DAO interaction [1], the interaction has not
been confirmed using an endogenous tissue source. More
importantly, two recent reports have failed to confirm the
previous findings [3,33], which is consistent with our own
inability to reproduce the protein-protein interaction of
G72 and DAO using recombinantly expressed proteins
(data not shown).

Whilst we were unable to detect G72 expression in human
fetal brain, it remains a possibility that G72 is developmentally regulated and plays a unique spatio-temporal
role in human brain development, independent of an
interaction with DAO. We have not had the opportunity
to investigate this further.

Attempted detection of G72 protein in human fetal brain and testis.
Western blots with Clontech "human protein medleys" (lane 1: fetal
brain, lane 2: testis) and total protein lysate from rat cortex, postnatal day
14 (negative control; lane 3). Probed with anti-G72 #1410; developed
using "ECL Advance" and long exposure time (> 10 min). A signal at
around 20 kDa, i.e. only slightly above the expected size for human G72,
was detected in human fetal brain and rat brain. However, a signal at the
same size was also detected in rat brain (lane 3). Since rodents to not possess a G72 orthologue (see main text), the observed signal at 20 kDa
appears to be unspecific, rather than representing endogenous G72 expression.

Conclusion
Robust genetic findings from several independent studies
have suggested the G72/G30 locus as a common susceptibility region for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. This
study investigated the mRNA and protein expression of
the G72 gene product in human tissues and aimed to shed
light on the physiological role of the predicted G72 protein, which has thus far not been resolved. Our experimental results, supported by an in silico analysis, do not
provide any evidence of appreciable G72 expression in
human brain or other human tissues at either the mRNA
or the protein level. Thus, native G72 protein, if expressed
at all, appears to only be present at extremely low levels
that may not be physiologically relevant. This casts doubt
on the proposed G72 protein modulation of DAO activity, which has been suggested to contribute to the pathology of schizophrenia. Further studies are required
therefore to understand the significance of the G72/30
locus to schizophrenia.
