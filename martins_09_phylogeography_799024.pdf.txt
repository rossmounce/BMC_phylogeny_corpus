Abstract
Background: The common vampire bat Desmodus rotundus is an excellent model organism for studying
ecological vicariance in the Neotropics due to its broad geographic range and its preference for forested
areas as roosting sites. With the objective of testing for Pleistocene ecological vicariance, we sequenced
a mitocondrial DNA (mtDNA) marker and two nuclear markers (RAG2 and DRB) to try to understand
how Pleistocene glaciations affected the distribution of intraspecific lineages in this bat.
Results: Five reciprocally monophyletic clades were evident in the mitochondrial gene tree, and in most
cases with high bootstrap support: Central America (CA), Amazon and Cerrado (AMC), Pantanal (PAN),
Northern Atlantic Forest (NAF) and Southern Atlantic Forest (SAF). The Atlantic forest clades formed a
monophyletic clade with high bootstrap support, creating an east/west division for this species in South
America. On the one hand, all coalescent and non-coalescent estimates point to a Pleistocene time of
divergence between the clades. On the other hand, the nuclear markers showed extensive sharing of
haplotypes between distant localities, a result compatible with male-biased gene flow. In order to test if
the disparity between the mitochondrial and nuclear markers was due to the difference in mutation rate
and effective size, we performed a coalescent simulation to examine the feasibility that, given the time of
separation between the observed lineages, even with a gene flow rate close to zero, there would not be
reciprocal monophyly for a neutral nuclear marker. We used the observed values of theta and an
estimated mutation rate for the nuclear marker gene to perform 1000 iterations of the simulation. The
results of this simulation were inconclusive: the number of iterations with and without reciprocal
monophyly of one or more clades are similar.
Conclusions: We therefore conclude that the pattern exhibited by the common vampire bat, with
marked geographical structure for a mitochondrial marker and no phylogeographic structure for nuclear
markers is compatible with a historical scenario of complete isolation of refuge-like populations during the
Pleistocene. The results on demographic history on this species is compatible with the Carnaval-Moritz
model of Pleistocene vicariance, with demographic expansions in the southern Atlantic forest.

Background
The diversity of life in the Neotropics diversity has fascinated researchers worldwide. Many theories have been
created to account for its extraordinary number of species,
and these theories have been vigorously debated in the
last decades [1]. One of the most cited and controversial
is the Refuge Theory. Originally proposed by Haffer [2], it
suggests that the Pleistocene glaciation cycles would create
contraction and subsequent expansion of forested areas
that in turn would create allopatry between populations
of the same forest-dwelling species, leading to intraspecific differentiation and consequently speciation. Paleopalinogical studies demonstrate that the Neotropical
forested areas have been very dynamic: the Atlantic forest
and the Amazon were connected in the past [3,4], becoming separated as increasing aridity in the Tertiary triggered
the formation of the belt of xeromorphic formations
between them [5]. There seemed to be a predominance of
arboreal vegetation during most of the Pleistocene with
Amazonic and Atlantic forest tree species in areas that
today lie in the dry diagonal that separates these two
biomes [see [6,7]]. The extent to which these climatic fluctuations and associated vegetation changes affected the
patterns of distribution and diversification of the fauna
remains a central question in understanding the evolution
of forest-associated taxa.
Species with broad geographical distribution in the Neotropics and a preference for forested habitats are specially
suitable for the study of past fragmentation and connectivity between forested areas such as the Amazon and the
Atlantic forest. The common vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus Geoffroy, 1810, is a species with a wide geographical
distribution: it ranges from southern Mexico to northern
Chile in the west, and the entire Brazilian and Uruguayan
territory in the east [8]. Throughout its extensive range it
occurs from sea level to over 3500 m of altitude and has
been captured in habitats as diverse as rainforests and
semi-arid vegetation. Due to the nature of previous phylogeographic studies in D. rotundus, it is believed that this
species relies on either caves or forested areas for roosting,
with the possibility of being captured in open sites while
foraging [9]. Even with such a wide distribution, and with
the existence of considerable morphological variation,
there are no currently recognized subspecies for this taxon
[8].
The common vampire bat feeds preferentially on medium
to large sized mammals [8]. It lives in colonies that generally consist of fewer than 100 individuals. These colonies
are formed by a dominant male, a number of peripheral
males and several groups of unrelated or distantly related
females [10-12]. The dominant male expels the juvenile
males from its natal colony, and it has been suggested that
the females are philopatric [11,12].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/294

Previous studies that focused on the intraspecific genetic
variation of the common vampire bat pointed to different
phylogeographic scenarios. Baker et al. [13] analysed 22
allozyme loci in different colonies of D. rotundus bats in
Central America and found low levels of genetic divergence both between individuals from the same and different colonies. Later, in a preliminary study carried in the
Atlantic forest of Brazil, Ditchfield [14] analysed cytochrome b sequences from seven different individuals and
found evidence for genetic structure together with sympatric haplotypes with high sequence divergence (4.0%).
This value is much higher than the average divergence
found for all other phyllostomid bats studied and suggets
that, when studied on a larger scale, this bat could show
phylogeographic structure for this marker.
Although largely used in phylogeographic studies, the
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a single locus and bears
limitations. Genealogies based on one single gene may be
problematic because each reconstruction is just one point
in the space of all possible genealogies. Depending on the
genealogical history of the population studied, this
approach may lead to erroneous inferences [15-19]. For
example, loci under selection may deviate from the
expected patterns of loci solely under demographic pressure and might mimic alternate demographic patterns
[20]. Selection acts locally in the genome, while it is
expected that demography affect all neutral loci uniformly
[21].
Species that present high differentiation at the mtDNA
level at times appear to be one single deme when nuclear
loci are included in the analysis. That has been described
for Drosophila [22], reptiles [23] and bats [24]. In the latter, the authors found population structure when analyzing distinct hibernation colonies of the bat Myotis myotis
throughout the Alps using mtDNA, but no differentiation
when microsatellites were used. The authors attributed
the results to female philopatry and male-biased dispersal. A similar scenario was described for the ghost bat Macroderma gigas [25].
Given the factors explained above, this work aims at using
mitochondrial and nuclear molecular markers to answer
the following questions: (I) is there geographic structure
for the common vampire bat D. rotundus? (II) Is this structure consistent across all markers? If not, what historical
scenarios could be responsible for the incongruence? (III)
Does the biogeographical pattern exhibited by the evolutionary lineages of this bat correspond to the expected distribution of lineages under the refuge hypothesis or any
other theory created to account for the high diversity in
the Neotropics?

Methods
Sampling, DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing
The Brazilian samples were collected by the authors under
federal license issued by the Instituto Brasileiro do Meio
Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais - IBAMA (Brazilian
Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural
Resources) with 36 mm mistnets. The animals were sacrificed and all the samples are deposited in the Laboratório
de Biologia Evolutiva e Conservação de vertebrados
(LABEC) tissue bank. Samples from outside Brazil were
donated by the American Museum of Natural History
(AMNH), the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (MVZ) and
the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM).

Total DNA was obtained from ethanol-preserved liver or
muscle and in two cases dried museum skin following
Bruford et al. [26]. The protocol and primers for amplification of the cyt b fragments are described elsewhere [9].
The amplification and sequencing of the RAG2 gene followed the same protocol used for the mitochondrial gene.
The primers used for amplification and sequencing of the
RAG2 gene are described in Baker et al. [27]. The primers
used for amplification and sequencing of the DRB intron
5 are described in Kupfermann et al. [28]. The eletropherograms were analyzed using the Sequence Navigator program and the Se-Al software [29] was used to align the
DNA sequences by eye.
Phasing of nuclear genotypes and recombination tests
Heterozygous nucleotide positions were identified by
conspicuous double peaks in the electropherograms of
both L and R strands. We used a Bayesian approach implemented in the software PHASE [30] to identify the haplotypes of heterozygous individuals.

In order to detect possible recombination events in the
RAG2 and DRB markers, we used the RDP2 software [31].
This software applies six different methods for detecting
recombination (see [32] and references therein). We used
windows of 20, 50 and 100 bp in each of the scans.
Phylogenetic analyses
Four different methods of phylogenetic inference were
used. A maximum parsimony (MP) analysis was implemented, weighting all nucleotide changes and codon
positions equally. Heuristic searches were run using random addition of taxa and tree bisection and reconnection
algorithm (TBR), as implemented in the PAUP* software
[32]. Bootstrap support [33] was estimated using 1000
replicates with heuristic mode parsimony. The maximum
likelihood (ML) analysis used the GTR model of nucleotide substitution with different base frequencies and a
gamma shape parameter of 0.3373, chosen using the
Modeltest software [34]. The search for the best maximum
likelihood tree also used the TBR algorithm. A distance-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/294

based analysis was implemented by using the substitution
model described above to estimate distances and the
neighbour joining algorithm to infer a phylogeny, also
using the PAUP* software. Last, we used the Bayesian
approach implemented in the Mr. Bayes software [35].
This method used the same substitution model as the ML
analyses. The program ran 5 × 106 generations until the
two chains had a standard deviation inferior to 0.01. The
tree saved with posterior probabilities on the nodes was
visualized using the Treeview software [36].
To complement the tree-based approaches we have also
implemented Nested Clade Analysis (NCA) using the TCS
software [37] with a statistical parsimony algorithm
[38,39]. The haplotype network was used as input for the
GEODIS software [40] and the result from this analysis
was used on the software's inference key (release date: 11/
11/2005).
Population level and coalescent analyses
Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA [41]) was used to
quantify the extent of population subdivision using the
Arlequin software [42]. Other summary statistics, as well
as neutrality tests (carried over for testing the hypothesis
of recent population expansion as expected under a Pleistocene refuge model) and dN/dS analyses were implemented using the DNAsp software [43].

To simultaneously estimate several population parameters, we used coalescent-based analyses. The following
population parameters were estimated: time of separation
between populations (t), θ (4Nμ), and a migration rate
(m), when applicable. These analyses were implemented
using the software MDIV [44] with a finite-sites model
(HKY [45]) using the first 5 × 105 cycles as burn in and 5.5
× 106 total cycles. Different runs were carried out assuming either complete isolation between populations (m =
0) or populations exchanging migrants at a rate m (estimated by the software). In order to determine whether the
model where m is estimated fits the data significantly better than the model of m = 0 we used the Akaike information criterion [46] to compare likelihoods, as described in
Nielsen & Wakeley [44]. We compared the coalescentbased estimates of t and θ obtained to estimates using a
methodology based on the net-sequence divergence
measure (calculated using MEGA4 software [47]; see
[48,49]) as described in Edwards & Beerli [50]. Two different mutation rates estimated for small-bodied mammals
were used to calculate divergence times as applied by
Hoffman et al. [51] for phyllostomid bats: 2.6% and 5.0%
per million years. Generation time was assumed to be one
year. We have also estimated a substitution rate for the
RAG2 gene based on the data published by Baker et al.
[27] on the phylogeny of the Phyllostomid family. We
used Modeltest to estimate the model of nucleotide sub-

stitution and calculated the number of substitution using
the origin of the family at 32 My ago as a calibration point
as implemented by Teeling et al. [52]. The mutation rate
was estimated at 1.94 × 10-9 substitutions per site per year,
similar to other mutation rates for nuclear genes in mammals [53].

simulated demes. On both simulations we used a biogeographic scenario based on the results obtained on the
analyses implemented in this work: a split between the
Amazon and the Atlantic forest around 900.000 YBP and
a split between North and South Atlantic forest circa
500.000 YBP.

Coalescent simulations of nuclear sequence data
According to Hare [20], the average nuclear marker will
not trace Pleistocene events in the same manner as mitochondral markers due to its larger effective size, lower
mutation rates and diploid nature. If that statement is correct then the nuclear marker used in this study may be
non-informative in phylogeographic analyses, even in the
case of null or negligible gene flow between the demes. In
order to examine the compatibility of a scenario where (I)
there is null or negligible gene flow between two demes
and (II) the mitochondrial analysis yields reciprocally
monophyletic clades and the nuclear markers shows little
to no phylogenetic signal, we decided to conduct a coalescent simulation of the nuclear data. We used the estimates
of time of separation between the lineages and of mutation rates to generate DNA data for three populations. The
next step is to use this data for generating phylogenetic
trees and check for presence/absence of reciprocal monophyly of the populations. If the demographic scenario
estimated for the observed data (with the given values of t
and θ) generates no monophyly in ≥ 95% of the simulations, we can demonstrate that a pleistocenic scenario of
complete isolation generates dissimilar results between
mitochondrial and nuclear markers, as suggested by Hare
[20].

Results

We used two softwares that implement coalescent simulations to test this hypothesis. The first one is the
SIMCOAL2 software [54]. This program allows for complex demographic models including population split,
arbitrary migration rates and population contraction and
expansion. The values used for this simulation were the
ones estimated for the nuclear loci analyzed in this study:
we used a θ value of 3.66, the mutation rate calculated for
the RAG2 gene (1.94 × 10-9 substitutions per site per year)
and estimated the same number of chromosomes sampled for the actual data (24 for AMC, 50 for SAF and 62
for NAF). We ran 1000 iterations. We also used the
MLCOALSIM software [55]. This coalescent simulator
does not allow for very complex demographic settings:
therefore we used an island model with negligible migration rates (m = 0.01), as null migration rates make the
trees infinite and cause the program to crash. This simulation also used 1000 iterations. The outfiles generated by
the software were converted to a format that was used as
infile for the program TNT [56] using a LINUX script. The
TNT program generated as outfile a matrix showing presence/absence of reciprocal monophyly for each of the

Molecular variation
For the mitochondrial marker, 118 individuals were sampled from 54 localities. A sequence of 832 bp of the cyt b
gene was obtained for each specimen, and 72 haplotypes
were described for D. rotundus and two for Diphylla ecaudata (used as outgroup). A total of 233 nucleotide sites
were variable, and 152 of these variable sites were parsimony informative.

For the RAG2 gene 88 individuals were sequenced for a
fragment 774 bp long, for a total of 176 chromosomes
sampled. The individuals sampled belong to all the major
localities sampled in the mitochondrial analysis except
the Pantanal area. A total of 43 variable sites were identified, fifteen of which were heterozygous. After the analyses with the PHASE software, 45 unique haplotypes were
identified. The haplotypic diversity for this dataset is very
high (h = 0.896), but the nucleotide diversity was very low
(π = 0.00314). The recombination analyses revealed no
recombination events for this marker. For the DRB1 gene,
only 62 sequences were obtained, each 282 bp long.
Again, no samples from the Pantanal region could be
amplified and sequenced. Fourteen variable sites were
identified, including a two base pair indel at the end of
this intron. The analysis with the software PHASE identified 18 unique haplotypes. Once again very low levels of
nucleotide variability were observed (π = 0.00458). The
table with all individuals, its respective localities, haplotypes and Genbank accession numbers can be found in
the Additional file 1.
Phylogenetic inference: mitochondrial marker
Figure 1 shows the MP phylogenetic reconstruction for the
haplotypes described. The NJ phylogenetic tree was identical to the MP tree. The ML and bayesian analyses are
largely congruent with this tree, with the exception of the
relationships among a few terminal taxa. The figure shows
that there are five major monophyletic clades representing
distinct geographical regions and biomes. These are the
following: Northern Atlantic Forest (NAF), Southern
Atlantic Forest (SAF), Pantanal and Cerrado (PAN), Central America (CA) and Amazon and Cerrado (AMC). A
single sample from Ecuador could not be assigned to any
of the clades. Another sample from the southernmost area
of the Atlantic forest is basal to the NAF and SAF clades.
The distribution of each of these clades in the American
continent can be seen in Figure 2. Although the clades had

high bootsptrap and bayesian posterior probability support (except for the basal haplotypes on the AMC clade,
which is discussed later), the relationship between the
major clades - excluding the Atlantic forest monophyly received very weak support and was not the same across
all methods of phylogenetic reconstruction.

On the nested clade analysis, the TCS software identified
the same clades as the tree-based methods. The high
nucleotide divergence found between the clades made it
impossible for the statistical parsimony algorithm to connect these networks even at 80% confidence intervals. The
haplotype network is presented on Figure 3. To implePage 6 of 13

ment subsequent analyses using GEODIS, we decided to
use the approach described in Durant et al. [57], where
the last-step clade incorporates the clade formed by SAF
and NAF together and the three clades (AMC, PAN and
CA). This decision was made based on the fact that the
relationship between these three clades is poorly resolved.
Because the Atlantic forest was recognized as monophyletic in all analyses, we have clustered SAF and NAF in
the same nesting clade for the NCA analyses as well. Both
clusters were made independent on where and how these
clades would connect. High and significant correlations
between the haplotypes and their geographical localities
were identified by the software GEODIS. The inference
key identified the pattern observed to the Atlantic forest as
a whole as allopatric fragmentation. In the case of the last
step clade, our sampling does not allow to discriminate
between allopatric fragmentation and isolation by distance - which was predictable, given the large gaps in sampling, especially in central Brazil and northwestern South
America.
Phylogenetic inference: nuclear markers
With the extensive sharing of haplotypes and low nucleotide variability observed for the nuclear markers, all treebased methods were non-informative. We therefore
decided to implement unrooted networks to extract more
information from the data. For the RAG2 gene, the analysis with the TCS software generated a very large number of
ambiguous connections. In order to carry the subsequent
analyses, single-copy non-internal haplotypes with multiple connections were removed from the data matrix. The
final data matrix generated the network used as input in
the GEODIS software. The network for the DRB intron
used all haplotypes. The hierarchical grouping of clades
was done manually. The analyses carried with the GEODIS software found no statistical correlation between
clades and geography for both markers, meaning that all
analyses were inconclusive.
Population-level analyses and coalescent estimates
The structure found in the phylogenetic analyses for the
mitochondrial marker was also observed in the population-level analyses. The overall fixation index was high
and significant (Fst = 0.16; p << 0.05). All pairwise comparison between the clades identified were also significant. The AMOVA result reflect the same pattern: 84.15%
of the variance is found within populations. All neutrality
tests applied were non-significant except for the SAF clade
(Tajima's D = -2.18; p = 0.003; Fu's Fs = -4.72; p = 0.002).
The time divergence estimates for these clades are in Table
1. In all but two pairwise comparisons (SAF × PAN and
NAF × PAN) the best fitting model was the one of complete isolation (m = 0). This result yields flat likelihood
surfaces for the parameter t making it impossible to calculate coalescent time divergence estimates. The coalescent

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/294

and non-coalescent time estimates for each comparison
are very similar and all within the Pleistocene epoch.
For the RAG2 gene, the mean nucleotide divergence in the
sample was very low (0.6%) and there is an extensive
sharing of haplotypes between very distant localities,
including the localities belonging to distinct mitochondrial lineages. At the same time, there is an equal number
of exclusive haplotypes for each of these regions.
Given the results obtained for the mtDNA, we decided to
conduct further analyses utilizing the mtDNA clades as
populations for the nuclear markers. Even with this extensive sharing of haplotypes, Fst values between the locations demarcated by the mitochondrial clades were all
significant for both markers. The AMOVA analysis showed
that 95% of the allele variance is found within populations for RAG2, and 92.35% for DRB. All neutrality tests
were non significant for RAG2 except the SAF (D = -1.52,
p = 0.042; Fs = 8.68, p = 0.002), which is identical to the
result obtained for mtDNA. This result could not be replicated by the DRB intron, probably due to poor sampling
for these localities (only ten individuals). Table 2 summarizes the population genetics results for the RAG2 marker.
The results obtained for dN/dS analyses for the nuclear
markers showed approximately ten synonymous substitutions for each non-synonymous, congruent with the
expected pattern for neutral markers described in the literature [58].
The coalescent analyses using the MDIV software was
implemented in the RAG2 dataset and yielded a time of
divergence of 500,000 years (95% confidence interval
229,000-940,000 years) between the two Atlantic forest
clades and 900,000 years (95% confidence interval
524,000-1,400,000 years) between the Atlantic forest
clades and the AMC clade, values congruent with the ones
obtained for the mitochondrial marker and that were used
in the coalescent simulations. We decided to not implement the coalescent analyses on the DRB intron due to a
lack of reliable mutation rate estimates.
Coalescent simulations
The simulations generated by the sofware SIMCOAL yield
unrealistic results. The outfiles were run in the Arlequin
software and in all the outfiles generated the number of
variable sites was equal to the number of nucleotide sites.
Given these conditions, each chromosome was a distinct
haplotype. These results are completely incongruent with
the observed data and had to be discarded from the analyses.

We decided to concentrate our efforts on the MLCOALSIM
software. The outfiles generated had similar haplotype

demes in average similar to the observed data for RAG2.
Given these conditions we ran the 1000 iterations on the
TNT software using maximum parsimony. The results of
these analyses are summarized in Table 3. The results
show that there is no clear distinction between all possible
scenarios involving reciprocal monophyly of the clades,
i.e., all possible scenarios have similar probabilities of
ocurring given the history and demographic parameters
observed in the data and used (with adaptations) in the
simulation. Therefore, no scenarios could be confirmed or
excluded.

when molecular markers are studied. In the case of the
common vampire bat, the population subdivision found
for the mitochondrial marker does not translate into colonies or hibernation sites, as has been described for other
bats (see [59] and [24]). The subdivision corresponds to
different ecodomains and has correspondence in other
vertebrate organisms. Therefore we are dealing with a
complex pattern that needs to be carefully discussed.
The common vampire bat can fly 20 km from roost to
feeding site in a single night [60]. It inhabits all the
biomes that exist in the Neotropics, from seasonally
flooded forests to semi-arid environments, and from sea
level to 3600 meters of altitude. Therefore there are no
identifiable physical barriers for dispersal and gene flow
in the distributional range of this bat. In this case, it is
likely that ecological barriers serve as a possible explanation to the structure found for this bat. All the divergence
times estimated using coalescent and non-coalescent
approaches fall within the Pleistocene epoch, suggesting
that this bat is indeed susceptible to forest fragmentation.
The east/west separation detected by the mitochondrial
marker in D. rotundus is very clear and coincides with the
biogeographic provinces described by Koopman [61] for
South America, but unfortunately, when using this
marker, the relationship between the western clades
remains obscure. On the one hand, the high nucleotide
divergence to the outgroups of the analysis (up to 30%)
may have influenced the topology of the tree. On the

other hand the lack of resolution regarding the phylogenetic relationships between these three clades may reflect
concomitant historical events of divergence. In this case,
there would be an interesting corridor for gene flow along
the eastern slopes of the Andes cordillera, that generated
the clade formed by PAN and CA that showed high bootstrap support as shown in Figure 1. The other ancestral
clade would be formed along the Guiana and Brazilian
shields (that originated the AMC and the Atlantic forest
clades).
The high levels of sequence divergence may also be
responsible for low bootstrap values showed by the AMC
clade; but since this clade was consistently present with
the exact same topology in all methods employed in this
study, we consider this clade to be reflecting the true relationship between the sampled haplotypes. Since two of
the three basal haplotypes are peripheral in the clades geographical distribution (one in Venezuela and one in
Marajó Island, at the mouth of the Amazon river), it is
possible that fine-scale sampling could reveal a better resolution of this very large geographical area.
The Atlantic forest has become separated of the other area
clades during the Pleistocene epoch, a result that is congruent with the appearance of a dry belt separating this
forested area from the Amazon. This is the first study to
suggest a Pleistocene separation of the Atlantic forest and
the Amazon based on the phylogeographic data collected
on a vertebrate species using molecular-based estimates of
divergence times.
This work describes the Atlantic forest of Brazil as a composite area, with northern and southern components. The
latitudinal division of this area has been recognized using
parsimonious analysis of endemicity in amphibians
[62,63], reptiles [64], birds [65] and harvestmen [66].
More recently, phylogeographic studies that used mtDNA
described this structure in organisms as diverse as birds
[67], pit vipers [68], non-volant small mammals [69],
canids [70] and the bat species Carollia perspicillata [14].
All the studies that implemented time estimates yielded
Pleistocene divergence times for this event. There are
numerous paleopalinological and sediment studies that
describe that this region has been fragmented with dry

open areas related to glaciation-driven events during the
Pleistocene [71-74].
In a recent study, Carnaval and Moritz [75] generated climatic simulation data and cross-referenced their results
with phylogeographic and paleopalinological studies. The
authors describe a scenario where in its northern portion
the Atlantic forest have always supported an evergreen forest even during the driest conditions, while south of the
Doce river the climatic conditions would not support a
forest formation. The authors suggest that in its current
southern distribution, the Atlantic forest was probably
fragmented in several small patches in the wettest areas, a
scenario that was proposed before by Whitmore and
Prance [76]. The results shown here are congruent with
this scenario: the SAF clade is the only one with significant
evidence of population expansion for two different markers. According to Lessa et al. [77], refuges would not only
create geographic structure that cannot be associated with
conspicuous contemporaneous physical barriers on
molecular markers, but these same markers should bear
the footprints of a population expansion related to the
end of the last glacial cycle. The results obtained here
reflect the predictions of Pleistocene forest dynamics: the
time divergence estimates all fall within this epoch and
the estimated historical demography is congruent with
refugia.
The existence of a Atlantic forest lineage that is basal to
both SAF and NAF comes as a surprise, specially because
this lineage is at the southernmost end of the Atlantic forest distribution - where according to the Carnaval-Moritz
model, there should be no forests at the last glacial maximum. Two different scenarios can be hypothesized for
this data: (I) retention of ancestral polimorphism associated with demographic expansion [78] from the hypothesized São Paulo refugium [9,75] or (II) there could be
more geographic structure regarding the common vampire bat that the sampling presented here allows discriminating. This particular haplotype could represent another
lineage and a possible contact zone between this lineage
and the SAF.
Mitochondrial and nuclear incongruence
The incongruence between the results observed for the
mitochondrial and nuclear markers could be due to two

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:294

different scenarios: complete fragmentation and incongruence between markers due to the nature and characteristics of each molecular marker or long-term female
philopatry and male-biased dispersal. We will discuss
each of these hypotheses in detail.
The first possibility - of complete isolation between populations but no footprints in nuclear markers due to larger
effective size and lower mutation rates - was the reason
behind the coalescent simulations carried in this study.
The results of the simulations have shown that given the
mutation rate, time of separation and effective population
size calculated for these bats, an average nuclear marker
might or might not reflect the true demographic history of
this species with similar probabilities. Given that, we
believe that the best way to approach the question on
whether the structure found is valid or the outcome of
long-term female philopatry would be to sequence a
larger number of loci - at least 16 according to Moore [79]
- in search of more accurate phylogenetic reconstructions
or use other nuclear markers such as the Y chromosome or
microsatellites, all of which are beyond the scope of the
present analysis. The RAG2 marker was chosen based on
the work by Lewis-Oritt et al. [80] that described relatively
high levels of intraspecific divergence for this marker in
Moormopidae bats (comparable in some cases to mtDNA
intraspecific divergence in bats). The DRB intron was chosen due to the possibility of studying balancing selection
on the common vampire bat - as described for many of
the genes that comprise the major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) in vertebrates. This work shows that
these two markers do not seem appropriate for intraspecific phylogeographic studies.
Females of D. rotundus usually remain in their natal colonies after they reach maturity, as observed by Wilkinson
[11], but they may also join a new group not far from their
birthplace. In addition, females do occasionally migrate
among roosts, so there is evidence of some adult female
dispersal. Under these conditions of female philopatry
with restricted dispersal, the expected pattern of differentiation would be one of isolation by distance [9]. However, in our analyses we find low sequence divergence
among localities at large geographic distances (over 400
km), and large increases in genetic differentiation taking
place over relatively short distances. This pattern is particularly clear in the analysis of the Atlantic forest. The NAF
and SAF possess similar geographical area and distances
between the localities sampled. Both clades show low differentiation (maximum haplotype divergence being
under 1% in SAF and under 3% in NAF) over a broad geographical range (see Figure 2), but are highly divergent
from one another (mean divergence 6.6%), with haplotypes differing by 7% separated by less than 200 km. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/294

NCA results point towards the same direction in opposition to isolation by distance. We believe that if the sampling gaps were filled, this outcome on the inference key
(allopatric fragmentation) would be observed repeatedly
among all clades. The results observed for the mtDNA
marker show strong evidence of historical fragmentation,
even with limited information on the extent of historical
and current male-mediated gene flow.

Conclusions
The phylogeographic pattern described for the common
vampire bat Desmodus rotundus is characterized by Pleistocene ecological vicariance. The mitochondrial marker
showed deep divergence between reciprocally monophyletic clades representing distinct ecodomains within
the Neotropics. There was also a clear East/West division
within South America, where the coastal Atlantic forest
was separated from the Amazon and the Pantanal by the
Brazilian dry diagonal of open formations. The times of
separation between the lineages are all within the Pleistocene epoch. The phylogenetic pattern is congruent with
many other Neotropical clades. In addition, the historical
demography, with a population expansion at the southern end of the distribution, is compatible with the Carnaval-Moritz model of historic Atlantic forest dynamics. The
coalescent simulations showed that, given the population
parameters estimated for this species, a nuclear marker
may or may not recover Pleistocene population history
with similar probabilities.
The next step in revealing the true nature of the interactions between the mitochondrial clades indentified and
the species status within D. rotundus will be finding the
exact locations of the contact zones between these clades
and studying in detail the different kinds of interactions
between the animals in these localities. This study would
consider not only a multiloci approach but also field
observations on ecology and behavior. We are also on the
way to conduct experiments with bats genotyped for the
different clades under controlled laboratory conditions,
to test for reproductive isolation and the possible ramification of the hybridization between the animals belonging to different clades.
