Abstract
Background: Tnt1 was the first active plant retrotransposon identified in tobacco after nitrate
reductase gene disruption. The Tnt1 superfamily comprises elements from Nicotiana (Tnt1 and
Tto1) and Lycopersicon (Retrolyc1 and Tlc1) species. The study presented here was conducted to
characterise Tnt1-related sequences in 20 wild species of Solanum and five cultivars of Solanum
tuberosum.
Results: Tnt1-related sequences were amplified from total genomic DNA using a PCR-based
approach. Purified fragments were cloned and sequenced, and clustering analysis revealed three
groups that differ in their U3 region. Using a network approach with a total of 453 non-redundant
sequences isolated from Solanum (197), Nicotiana (140) and Lycopersicon (116) species, it is
demonstrated that the Tnt1 superfamily can be treated as a population to resolve previous
phylogenetic multifurcations. The resulting RNAseH network revealed that sequences group
according to the Solanaceae genus, supporting a strong association with the host genome, whereas
tracing the U3 region sequence association characterises the modular evolutionary pattern within
the Tnt1 superfamily. Within each genus, and irrespective of species, nearly 20% of Tnt1 sequences
analysed are identical, indicative of being part of an active copy. The network approach enabled the
identification of putative "master" sequences and provided evidence that within a genus these
master sequences are associated with distinct U3 regions.
Conclusion: The results presented here support the hypothesis that the Tnt1 superfamily was
present early in the evolution of Solanaceae. The evidence also suggests that the RNAseH region
of Tnt1 became fixed at the host genus level whereas, within each genus, propagation was ensured
by the diversification of the U3 region. Different selection pressures seemed to have acted on the
U3 and RNAseH modules of ancestral Tnt1 elements, probably due to the distinct functions of
these regions in the retrotransposon life cycle, resulting in both co evolution and adaptation of the
element population with its host.

Background
Retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements that transpose via an RNA intermediate. They are abundant and
widespread components of eukaryotic genomes [1]. There
are two major types of retrotransposons: long terminal
repeat (LTR) retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons such as LINEs (long interspersed nuclear elements) and SINEs (short interspersed nuclear elements)
[2,3]. LTR retrotransposons are abundant in plant
genomes and can constitute a very large fraction of the
host genome [4,5].
LTR retrotransposons are flanked by LTRs in direct orientation. LTRs are subdivided into U3 (unique 3'RNA), R
(repeated RNA) and U5 (unique 5'RNA) regions. Regulatory signals such as promoter, terminator regions and
polyadenylation sites are found in the LTRs [2]. Besides
the functional importance of these sequences, several
studies have reported that the LTRs are the most-rapidly
evolving regions of retrotransposons [6,7].
LTR retrotransposons encode a number of proteins
derived from the gag and pol genes, which are usually transcribed as two main mRNAs. The proteins in pol are synthesised as a polyprotein that is cleaved by an internal
protease activity releasing the internal protein activities
endonuclease/integrase, reverse transcriptase and ribonuclease H (RNAseH). The gag gene encodes a protein
involved in maturation and packaging of the RNA form of
the retrotransposon. The life cycle of an element involves
transcription by cellular RNA polymerase II, reverse transcription, packaging into virus-like particles, and integration of the cDNA copy back into the genome [2].
The retrotransposon Tnt1, first characterised in tobacco, is
one of the few plant retrotransposons for which transpositional activity has been demonstrated [8]. Tnt1-like
sequences have been detected in several Solanaceae and in
Nicotiana at least three major groups can be differentiated
based on U3 regulatory region sequence divergence giving
rise to Tnt1A, B and C subfamilies [9-12]. Retrolyc1 elements detected in tomato share extensive nucleotide similarities to Tnt1 elements except in the U3 region [13,14].
Distinct from Tnt1, Retrolyc1 sequences comprise two
subfamilies, Retrolyc1A and B, also distinguished at the
regulatory U3 region [14].
The retrotransposon life cycle results in genome amplification and for this reason their activity is tightly controlled by the host. Besides rounds of amplification, host
genome size can be scaled down by homologous recombination events within an element or between elements,
usually leading to an increase in the copy number of
SOLO-LTR sequences [15]. The work presented here aims
to address the question of 'how' Tnt1-related sequences

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/34

differentiated in three Solanaceae genera (Nicotiana, Lycopersicon and Solanum) and if there is any evidence for the
occurrence of lateral gene transfer. These questions were
addressed in a total of 453 non-redundant sequences
using a population model approach based on recent studies of the amplification of Alu sequences among human
and chimpanzee lineages [16,17].
The results presented here demonstrate the existence of
Tnt1 superfamily related lineages in all species studied.
Sequences analyses corroborate the hypothesis that the
Tnt1-superfamily has evolved through differentiation of
the U3 region as previously suggested [12]. RNAseH clustering studies revealed the existence of a major representative RNAseH sequence (α sequence) suggesting the
presence of active copies. However, the highly diverse U3
region presents inter- and intra-specific diversification,
which supports the hypothesis of a rapidly evolving
sequence that can be interpreted as a strategy either to
evade negative control by the host or to quickly adapt to
the new evolving host genome thus contributing to host
fitness.

Results
Tnt1-like sequences within different Solanum species
The presence of Tnt1-like sequences within 25 wild and
cultivated Solanum genotypes (Table 1) was assayed by
PCR using primers designed on the Tnt1 sequence
anchored in the terminal part of the ribonuclease H
(RNAseH) domain (Avi), and on the U5 region (Ol16)
spanning part of RNAseH, Linker, U3, R and a portion of
U5 region (Figure 1). Fragments of the expected size (500
bp) were detected in all genotypes analysed (Table 2).
Sequence analysis using the NCBI Blast tool [35] confirmed that all 317 cloned fragments exhibited similarity
to the Tnt1 superfamily and were therefore named "Retrosol" to designate them as retrotransposons from Solanum.
Alignment of nine Retrosol sequences, chosen randomly
from seven distinct species, to Tnt1 and Retrolyc1 retrotransposon sequences revealed that the similarity spans
the RNAseH, R and U5 regions but not U3 (Figure 2).

Intra-genotype redundancy was eliminated and only
unique sequences within species were considered for further sequence studies (Table 2). As these species do not
have well-characterised genomes, it cannot be determined
whether the amplified Retrosol fragments represent an
unbiased random sample of sequence diversity. However,
for a survey of the evolution of this element family, this
approach seems appropriate as it was also used previously
in the characterisation of the Tnt1 and Retrolyc1 families.
A few sequences had a premature stop codon and others
no stop codon at all in the RNAseH domain (Table 2).

The nucleotide divergence index (πJC), with Jukes and
Castor's correction, was calculated for the full-length fragment sequence within each genotype. Numbers range
from 0.026 to 0.287, and allow the genotypes to be classified within three sets (Table 2). The most diverse displays
πJC values ≥ 0.2 and encompassed S. hannemanii, S. kurtzianum and S. okadae species. The second, involving S.
acaule, S. megistacrolubom and S. xsucrense, presented values between 0.1 and 0.2; while the third, involving all
remaining species had an πJC index of < 0.1. It is worth
pointing out that cultivated potatoes (S.tuberosum cultivar
Huinkul, Kennebec, and subsp. andigenum cul. Moradita,
Chacarera and Tuni) were in the least diverse group.
Phylogenetic Relationships of Solanaceae Tnt1-related
sequences
To visualise the relationship between all Solanaceae Tnt1related sequences, a phylogenetic analysis was performed
using all full-length fragments amplified. Retrosol
sequences were aligned, together with representatives of
Tnt1A B and C, and Retrolyc1A and B subfamily
sequences. Three groups were obtained supported by a
bootstrap of 98% or higher (Figure 3). Group I contains
87 sequences, including both wild and cultivated species
and all 15 sequences amplified from S. brevidens (Table 2).

Nucleotide identity between sequences varies from 80–
90%. Group II has 95 sequences from wild and cultivated
species (Table 2) and nucleotide identity is higher than
90% between sequences. Group III has 15 sequences
belonging to 6 wild species: S. acaule, S. hannemanii, S.
kurtzianum, S. okadae and S. xsucrense (Table 2) with variable nucleotide identity ranging from 60–95%. The Tnt1
C sequence clusters to Group III while Tnt1 A, B and
Retrolyc1 A and B form a bridge between Groups I and II
and the other sequences.
The πJC index calculated for all unique Retrosol sequences
was 0.087 ± 0.0000571. Considering Retrosol phylogenetic groups separately, the nucleotide variability is lower
for sequences of Group II (0.030 ± 0.0000016), and for
Group I (0.063 ± 0.0000035). Group III has the highest
value (0.220 ± 0.0009489), probably representing more
than one group of related sequences. Nucleotide diversity
is not uniformly distributed amongst the amplified fragments. When a comparative sliding window for nucleotide diversity is applied on all aligned sequences or
within each group, as shown in Figure 4, higher substitution rates are seen to be in the U3 region. However, when
nucleotide diversity distribution was analysed within each
group, Group II showed a less diverse U3 region com-

pared to the other groups, while Group III sequences
exhibited the highest diversity in the U3 region. The data
support the hypothesis that Solanum species harbour at
least three versions of U3 regulatory regions, although
based on previous Tnt1 superfamily U3 divergence studies
[12], Group III could represent more than one version.
NETWORK analysis of Tnt1 superfamily ribonuclease H
Network approaches have been designed to investigate
relationships between closely related sequences, allowing
identification of persistent ancestral nodes, multifurcations and reticulations, which are not resolved when
applying a conventional phylogenetic package [19]. In the
network approach, the most-represented identical
sequences – named α or master copy – occupy a central
position in the net with high numbers of branches suggesting that the sequence represents part of an active element. This approach is based on the parsimony principle,
which connects data sets with the minimum number of
evolutionary steps. Reticulations on the net could result
from recombination and/or homoplasy [18,19].

Considering the Tnt1 superfamily of retrotransposons in
the genera Solanum, Lycopersicon and Nicotiana as a population of sequences with a common ancestor, a Network
study was carried out with the aim of testing the hypothesis that a common α master sequence exists in Tnt1-superfamily. The 53 nucleotides corresponding to the last
portion of the RNAseH coding domain from a total of 453
Tnt1 like-sequences (197 Retrosol sequences reported in
this study, 140 Tnt1 sequences characterised from 7 Nicotiana species and 116 Retrolyc1 sequences from 4 species
of Lycopersicon) were used for network analysis. The resulting network (Figure 5a) revealed that Tnt1, Retrolyc1 and
Retrosol did not share any RNAseH sequence as revealed
by the absence of shared nodes, although different species
within each genus did share a master sequence.
In Retrosol sequences, the unique α node observed (α1)
represents 25.5% of all Retrosol sequences and encompasses S. hannemanii, S. incamayoense, S. infundibuliforme,
S. microdontum, S. megistacrolobum, S. okadae, S. sanctarosae, S. spegazzinii, S. tarijense, S. x sucrense, S. vernei and all

S. tuberosum cultivars. It is worth mentioning that 46 of
the 50 α1 sequences belong to Group II, which is the least
diverse phylogenetic group. Moreover, within α1 group it
was possible to identify identical U3 regions belonging to
different species and cultivars. A total of 13 non-redundant S. brevidens sequences are connected with the α
sequence in the net through a nucleotide change. None of
the sequences belonging to group III appear in the α1
cluster; group III sequences are located at a more distant
position in the net, suggesting a more distant relationship
with the core sequence and probably do not originated
from the α1 node.

belonged to L. peruvianum and only one from L. hirsutum
– all from Retrolyc1 A. Identical U3 sequences were
shared by different species in the α4 node.

Tnt1 sequences originated from two α nodes: α2 with
24% (34 sequences) and α3 with 12 % (17 sequences) of
Tnt1 sequences (Figure 5b). α2 sequences belonged to:
Nicotiana tabacum, N. debneyi, N. benthamiana, N. plumbaginifolia and N. sylvestris, embracing the three Tnt1 subfamilies (A, B and C). α3 clustered sequences from Nicotiana tabacum, N. glauca, N. debneyi, N. benthamiana, N.
plumbaginifolia and N. sylvestris, grouping Tnt1 subfamilies
A and C. It is interesting to note that Tnt1-94, for which
transpositional activity has been demonstrated [8],
grouped in the α3 node.

Discussion

Retrolyc1 showed three different α nodes: α4 with 18.9%
(22 sequences), α5 with 17% (20 sequences) and α6 with
13% (15 sequences) of Retrolyc1 sequences (Figure 5b).
α4 include sequences from Lycopersicon pimpinellifolium
and L. esculentum – all from the Retrolyc1 B subfamily. α5
has sequences that belong to L. peruvianum and to the
Retrolyc1 A subfamily, while α6 has 14 sequences that

Other data nodes with different numbers of sequences are
connected with the central α1, α2, α3, α4, α5 and α6
nodes, suggesting that these members could be active and
could contribute to the expansion of each element inside
its corresponding genus (Figure 5b). The network did not
show any excess of multidimensional reticulations so the
influence of homoplasy can be considered as negligible
[19].

Genome expansion and contraction resulting from
rounds of amplification/deletion of transposable elements is becoming accepted as a major component influencing the diversification of eukaryote genomes, as
suggested by studies in particular plant and animal species
[15,19]. Genome sequencing project also shed light on
the ancient associations of known transposable element
families with plant genomes. For example, in the work
described by Rossi et al. (2004) [20], a phylogenetic study
on Mutator-like elements (MULE) identified in sugarcane
revealed the existence of 4 MULE lineages in Angiosperms
prior to the divergence of Monocots and Eudicots.
The retrotransposon Tnt1 was initially characterised in
Nicotiana tabacum and then detected by probe hybridisation in other Solanaceae genomes [8]. Ten years later, a
new Tnt1-like element, Retrolyc1, was characterised in
Lycopersicon peruvianum [13]. In this study we report a new

In the BARE-1 retrotransposon of barley, the whole LTR is
heterogeneous [7], while in Tnt1 superfamily the variability is targeted specifically to the U3 region of the LTR [12].
The three subfamilies of Tnt1 retrotransposons, as well as
Retrolyc1 subfamilies, are also differentiated mainly by
the U3 region. Retrosol sequences present the same structure, showing an accumulation of INDELs and SNPs targeted specifically to the U3. Thus, the hyper variability of
the U3 region in the Tnt1-superfamily seems to be a general phenomenon of this element's evolution within
Solanaceae species.

Three clades emerged when applying phylogenetic methods to analyse amplified Retrosol sequences from Solanum
sequences. Groups I and II are consistent because they
represent cohesive versions of U3. In contrast, Group III
encompasses the most diverse sequences, probably due
more than one U3 version being represented. No correlation is observed between a particular U3 version and genotype, wild or cultivated species, or geographical
distribution (Tables 1, 2). These results suggest that the
amplification and differentiation of Retrosol occurred
prior to Solanum speciation.
A population model was applied in this work to evaluate
the relationships among Tnt1-derived elements in Sola-

num, Lycopersicon and Nicotiana with the aim of testing the
existence of a unique master copy. To analyse the Network
results, the three models of expansion proposed by
Cordaux et al (2004) [19] for Alu subfamily in humans
and primates were considered: the single 'master gene'
model, the intermediate model and the transposon
model. According to the 'master gene' model, a single αtype element generates all other subfamily members, leading to a star-like relationship with all inactive copies
derived from the α element. The contrasting transposon
model postulates that all element members can be active
in producing new copies, resulting in the lack of a radiation structure from the α central node. The intermediate
model suggests that several members are active and contribute to expansion. Relationships in this latter model are
expected to be partly star-like, but also with different proportions of elements that are not connected directly with
the central element depicted as the "α "-sequence.
The RNAseH network supports different models of expansion depending on the element. In addition, RNAseH
sequence types, represented by nodes in the net, are distinctive for each genus. Retrosol and Tnt1 show a star-like
topology, with the central α node corresponding to the
most frequent sequence type, although Tnt1 presented
more than one α node. Other nodes not directly connected with the central α node are also found, indicating
that the sequence type immediately downstream is also
capable of amplification. The unique Retrosol α node is
represented in 16 out of the 25 genotypes analysed, taking
into account that for most of the other 9 genotypes only a
few sequences were cloned. In summary, the model of
expansion of Tnt1 in Nicotiana sp. and Retrosol in Solanum sp. best suits the intermediate model. In contrast,
Retrolyc1 present a model with the absence of a radiating
structure from a central node and with more than two α
nodes, suggesting that many family members are capable
of producing new ones. However, these results cannot be
used to make conclusions regarding Retrolyc1 evolution
as the sequences used in this study were obtained from
only a few species of Lycopersicon.
The α1 in Retrosol encompasses 92% of Group II
sequences, representing 50% of the total Group II sample.
As mentioned above, Group II presents the least variable
U3 region (Figure 4), and several Group II sequences
amplified from different genotypes have identical U3
regions. Thus, sequences with identical RNAseH and U3
regions transposed prior to the divergence of the host species. This activity is recent enough that element copies
should not have accumulated mutations or deletions in
the U3 variable region. All these lines of evidence point
out the protagonist role of Group II in Retrosol expansion
as the transpositionally active lineage.

RNAseH is conserved in Retrosol elements across host
species from the same genus, while the U3 region has
evolved rapidly, in agreement with the concept of modular evolution. The conservation of the RNAseH module at
the genus level is related to its biological function, in
which the enzyme has to interact with other molecules.
RNAseH is involved in degradation of the original RNA
template, generation of a polypurine track, and final
removal of RNA primers from the newly synthesised
minus and plus DNA strands [21]. These functions are
necessary for the transpositional activity of the element.
On the other hand, the U3 module evolved rapidly in
accordance with its promoter function. New promoter
sequences may permit the expression of the element in
diverse environmental conditions, increasing the survival
potential of the element in the host and/or the probability
of overcoming host transcriptional silencing efforts. In
addition, the host may gain an advantage in generating
genome diversity by insertion of new retrotransposon
copies, increasing its own environmental fitness. Co-evolution and co-adaptation of retrotransposon with its host
genome is expected to play a particularly important role in
the long-term survival of these genetic elements [22].
The Solanaceae is one of the largest flowering plant families, embracing 96 genera. It has a world-wide distribution
but the greatest concentration of genera and species is
found in South and Central America. About three-quarters
of these genera and around half of the total number of
species are found there; strongly suggesting that the family
itself originated in the part of the ancient land mass that
later became South America [23]. In order to analyse the
evolution of the Tnt1 superfamily, species from three genera were considered: Solanum, Lycopersicon and Nicotiana.
Solanum is one of the largest genera in Angiosperms and
accounts for all wild and cultivated tuber-bearing species
originating in the high Andes of southern Peru and northern Bolivia. Lycopersicon includes the tomato and its wild
relatives, which are confined mainly to Chile, Peru and
Ecuador. Nicotiana encompasses cultivated tobacco and
wild species found mainly in South America and Australia. These three genera originated in South America but
the present species distribution reflects several dispersal
phenomena [24]. Could Tnt1-related elements be a determinant in the speciation of the Solanaceae?
As proposed by Grandbastien et al [12], the composition
of present element populations results from the adaptive
response of the ancestral Tnt1 population to different
hosts. This adaptive element response refers to appropriate expression patterns, efficient mechanisms of replication and integration, and insertion into non-deleterious
genomic sites. Ancestral copies exhibiting such adaptive
responses were selectively amplified during or after the
radiation of Solanaceae. On the other hand, non-tran-

scribed copies would have been rapidly inactivated and
lost. In Retrosol elements, no correlation is found
between host species, U3 region or RNAseH sequence
type, suggesting that diversification of Solanum species
was not a determinant of this retrotransposon population.
Similar results have been reported for Tnt1 [10] and
Retrolyc1 [14].

Conclusion
The use of a population model based on the network
approach to evaluate the nature of the association of Tnt1related sequences in Solanaceae supports the existence of
an ancestral element rather than the occurrence of recent
lateral gene transfer. The modular nature of such retrotransposons is clearly demonstrated by the finding that
protein functions, represented here by RNAseH, are characterised as slowly evolving sequences, while the U3 regulatory region is under a less restrictive evolutionary force.
Current populations of Tnt1, Retrolyc1 and Retrosol most
likely result from their vertical transmission in
Solanaceae. The molecular basis that drives U3 differentiation, and whether the rapidly evolving sequence is the
result of a strategy to evade host negative control or an
attempt to quickly adapt to the new evolving genome and
contribute to host fitness, remains to be demonstrated.

Methods
Plant Material and DNA extraction
Solanum seeds and mini-tubercles were kindly provided
by the Germplasm collection of INTA-Balcarce (Argentina). Details of species and cultivars collected from locations in Argentina and Bolivia are presented in Table 1.
These localities are included in the geographical distribution of the species. Solanum brevidens was included in the
study as the only species not producing tubers.

Fresh leaf material of commercial cultivars Kennebec and
Huinkul were obtained from in vitro clones (INTA-Castelar-Argentina), while local Argentinian cultivars Chacarera 109, Moradita 64 and Tuni 207 were obtained from
minitubers. The other Solanum wild species were germinated from seeds. All material was maintained and processed at Departamento de Botânica-IBUSP (Brazil).
Seeds were surface-sterilised with 10% (v/v) commercial
bleach for 15 min, followed by three rinses with sterile
water. Treatment with giberellic acid was performed for
24 hrs under dark conditions to break dormancy. Plants
were grown in vitro in Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal
medium supplemented with 20% sucrose under an 18 h
photoperiod, and 22°C day/18°C night temperature
regime, in a Percival growth chamber. After three months,
leaves were harvested for DNA extraction. Minitubers
were grown in soil under the same conditions. Total DNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/34

was extracted as previously described [25] with an average
yield of 600ng/mg of fresh tissue.
PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing
PCR amplifications were performed under standardised
conditions using 300 ng of genomic DNA in a final volume of 100 μL. The reaction mix contained 0.23 μM of
each primer (Avi; 5'GCTGACCAAGGTGGTAC3'; Ol16;
5'TTCCCACCTCACTACAATATCGC3'), 10 mM dNTPs,
1.5 mM MgCl2, and 5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen Brazil). Samples were amplified for 35 cycles with the
following cycling conditions: denaturing at 94°C for 45s,
annealing at 50°C for 45s, and extension at 72°C for 1
min. An initial denaturing step at 94°C for 5 min and a
final extension step for 10 min were also performed.

PCR-amplified fragments were resolved by electrophoresis on agarose gels. Following purification (QIAquick Gel
Extraction Kit-QIAGEN), fragments were cloned into the
vector pGEM-T-easy (Promega) following the manufacturer's recommendations.
A total of 317 clones were sequenced in both directions
using Big Dye Terminator Kit (Applied Biosystems) on an
ABI 3700 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). All consensus
sequences were generated with a quality Phred ≥ 20.
Clone sequences were assembled with the Phred/Phrap/
Consed package with a final error rate of < 1 bp/10 kb [2628].
Sequence alignment and analysis
The identity of the sequences obtained was confirmed by
a BLAST search [29] [available at the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Bethesda, Md.]. Consensus sequences were aligned using the CLUSTAL W multiple-alignment program (version 1.5) [30] and manual
adjustments of the alignments were performed when necessary.

Sequence divergence was analysed using the DnaSp program [31]. The PAUP program [32] was used to perform
phylogenetic analysis based on the distance method with
a nucleotide Kimura 2-parameters model. Support for
groups was evaluated with 1000 bootstrap replicates.
Nucleotide identity between all pairwise sequences was
calculated with Strecher from EMBOSS [33].
For Network clustering, sequences were aligned using
DNA Alignment 1.1.21 software and relationships were
analysed using NETWORK 4.1 [34] both software available at fluxus-engineering.com [36].
The Tnt1 sequences were deposited with the GenBank
nucleotide sequence database under the following accession numbers: [GenBank: AJ227998–AJ228017] for Nico-

Lycopersicon peruvianum, L. hirsutum, L. pimpinellifolium
and L. esculentum were obtained from Araujo et al. 2001
[14], and from this study.
