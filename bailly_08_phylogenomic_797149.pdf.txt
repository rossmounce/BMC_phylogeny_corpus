Abstract
Background: Hemerythrins, are the non-heme, diiron binding respiratory proteins of
brachiopods, priapulids and sipunculans; they are also found in annelids and bacteria, where their
functions have not been fully elucidated.
Results: A search for putative Hrs in the genomes of 43 archaea, 444 bacteria and 135 eukaryotes,
revealed their presence in 3 archaea, 118 bacteria, several fungi, one apicomplexan, a
heterolobosan, a cnidarian and several annelids. About a fourth of the Hr sequences were identified
as N- or C-terminal domains of chimeric, chemotactic gene regulators. The function of the
remaining single domain bacterial Hrs remains to be determined. In addition to oxygen transport,
the possible functions in annelids have been proposed to include cadmium-binding, antibacterial
action and immunoprotection. A Bayesian phylogenetic tree revealed a split into two clades, one
encompassing archaea, bacteria and fungi, and the other comprising the remaining eukaryotes. The
annelid and sipunculan Hrs share the same intron-exon structure, different from that of the
cnidarian Hr.
Conclusion: The phylogenomic profile of Hrs demonstrated a limited occurrence in bacteria and
archaea and a marked absence in the vast majority of multicellular organisms. Among the metazoa,
Hrs have survived in a cnidarian and in a few protostome groups; hence, it appears that in
metazoans the Hr gene was lost in deuterostome ancestor(s) after the radiata/bilateria split. Signal
peptide sequences in several Hirudinea Hrs suggest for the first time, the possibility of extracellular
localization. Since the α-helical bundle is likely to have been among the earliest protein folds, Hrs
represent an ancient family of iron-binding proteins, whose primary function in bacteria may have
been that of an oxygen sensor, enabling aerophilic or aerophobic responses. Although Hrs evolved
to function as O2 transporters in brachiopods, priapulids and sipunculans, their function in annelids
remains to be elucidated. Overall Hrs exhibit a considerable lack of evolutionary success in
metazoans.

Background
Three types of respiratory proteins occur in present day
metazoans: hemoglobin, ubiquitous among vertebrates
and found in most prokaryotes and eukaryotes [1,2],
hemocyanin, present mostly in arthropods and molluscs
[3], and hemerythrin (Hr) [4]. The latter occurs in coelomocytes in circulating coelomic fluid and in muscle tissue
as MHr, and was originally thought to be limited to three
minor protostome phyla, the Sipuncula, Brachiopoda and
Priapulida, and one annelid species [4-6]. Over the last
twenty years, cytoplasmic Hrs have been reported in all
three annelid groups, polychaetes [7-9], oligochaetes [10],
and hirudinae [11-13]. A recent molecular phylogenetic
study of sipunculan Hrs has shown them to have a close
relationship to annelid Hrs [14]. A Hr sharing > 43% identity with annelid Hrs, was found in a search for antigenrelated genes expressed in the heterolobosan Naegleria
fowleri, the causative agent of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis [15,16]. In the last few years, Hrs have
been found in bacteria, as a single domain protein in the
γ-proteobacterium Methylococcus capsulatus [17], and as a
C-terminal domain of a chimeric, methyl accepting chemotaxis protein in the sulfate-reducing δ-proteobacterium
Desulfovibrio vulgaris [18].
The crystal structures of metazoan Hrs and MHrs are very
similar [19,20], a four helix bundle of antiparallel α-helices (A through D) formed by polypeptide chains of 113aa
and 118aa, respectively. The active site consists of two
oxo-/hydroxo-bridged Fe atoms (Fig. s1 in Additional file
1). Fe1 is coordinated to three His side-chain groups in
helices C and D, and Fe2 is coordinated to two His sidechain groups in helices A and B; the carboxylate side-chain
groups of a Glu in helix C and an Asp in helix D, bridge
both irons. Although the D. vulgaris Hr domain is somewhat longer than metazoan Hrs, 130aa, it has a very similar structure [21].
We report below the results of an exhaustive search for
putative Hrs within the available genomes from the three
kingdoms of life and the isolation of Hr genes in several
annelids. Furthermore, we describe for the first time the
intron-exon structure of metazoan Hr genes, provide evidence for an extracellular occurrence of leech Hr, and discuss the implications of the phylogenomic distribution of
Hrs.

Results
Eukaryote Hrs
The previously known and the newly identified Hr
sequences are listed in Additional file 1 in Table s1,
together with their manual alignments shown in Fig. s2.
In addition to the metazoan Hrs identified earlier [14], we
have sequenced putative Hr genes from the sipunculan S.
nudus (Hr: AM886444 and MHr AM886445), the deep-sea

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/244

hydrothermal vent vestimentiferan R. pachyptila
(AM886446) and the polychaete S. armiger (AM886447).
Blastp searches revealed putative Hrs in the apicomplexan
Plasmodium yoelii, the heterolobosan Naegleria gruberi, the
cnidarian Nematostella vectensis (Radiata), the oligochaete
Lumbricus rubellus, the polychaete Periserrula leucophryna,
and the hirudineans Haementeria depressa and Helobdella
robusta. Although most eukaryotes have one or two Hrs,
the genomes of N. gruberi and H. robusta have 5 and 13
Hrs, respectively. No Hrs were found in the genome of the
polychaete Capitella sp.I http://www.jgi-psf.org/Capca1/
Capca1.info.html. Putative Hrs were also found in 10
Ascomycota and 3 Basidiomycota, out of a total of > 50
fungal genomes: all have very similar sequences, substantially different from other Hrs. We have used FUGUE,
which recognizes sequence-structure homology using
environment-specific substitution tables and structuredependent gap penalties [22] to define whether they
should be considered to be Hrs. Although their FUGUE Z
scores range from 6 to 8, interpreted as a certain assignment [22], they all share the following alterations in the
Hr motif (Fig. s2 in Additional file 1): absence of the conserved Trp in the pre-helix A and of the Asp in helix A, substitution of Asp for His in helix C, and of Glu for Asp in
helix D. Of the WLV triplet in helix D, only the Leu residue
(corresponding to L103 in the eukaryote sequences),
which is known to play an important role in Hr function
[23], is conserved. It remains to be determined whether
the foregoing alterations compromise the structural or
functional integrity of the fungal Hrs.
Intron-exon structure of metazoan genes
Since the intron-exon structure of Hr genes was unknown,
we determined the locations of introns in Hr genes from
the cnidarian N. vectensis (XP_001622541.1|GI:1563515
02), R. pachyptila, and S. nudus. An alignment of the
sequences showing the different intron locations is given
in Fig. 1. There are 2 introns in S. nudus Hr and MHr, the
first one located just prior to helix A and the other at the
end of helix B, both in phase 0. The annelid Hr genes have
2 or 3 introns: the locations of the first two introns are
identical in the polychaete vestimentiferan R. pachyptila
and the hirudinae H. robusta, and correspond to the locations in S. nudus Hr. A third intron (in phase 2) occurs in
the middle of helix D in some members of the multigenic
Hr family of H. robusta (Fig. 1). Although two introns are
also found in the N. vectensis Hr gene, they occur at different locations (Fig. 1). No introns were found in the apicomplexan and protozoan Hrs.
Signal peptide identification
SignalP 3.0 http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP was
employed to locate probable signal peptide cleavage sites
[24]. Of the 13 putative Hrs found in the genome of the
leech H. robusta, 8 appear to have atypical N-terminals

with a clearly identifiable signal peptide cleavage site (Fig.

and without signal peptides are observed: no signal peptide and 2 introns (jgi|Helro1|81783), a signal peptide
and 2 introns (jgi|Helro1|81862, 81728, 81835, 174825,

(jgi|Helro1|100875, 185740, 111854, 157306). The four
possibilities are shown in Fig. 1.
Prokaryote Hrs
Tables s2 and s3 and Fig. s2 in Additional file 1, list the
putative archaeal and bacterial Hrs and show their alignments, respectively. A salient feature of prokaryotic Hrs is
the presence of both single-domain Hrs and of chimeric
proteins with N- and C-terminal domains. Of the 43
archaeal genomes, only 4 euryarchaeote genomes have 6

Hrs, one of them an N-terminal domain of a methyl
accepting chemotaxis protein. Of the 444 bacterial
genomes 118 (27%) have a total of 326 Hrs. Table 1
shows the distribution of single-domain and chimeric Hrs
in the main bacterial groups that have Hrs: 242 (74%) are
single-domain Hrs and 84 (26%) are domains in chimeric
proteins. No Hrs were found in the genomes of Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi, Chlamydiae/Verrumicrobia, Chloroflexi, Deinococcus/Thermus, Fusobacteria, Nitrospirae
and Thermotogales. The number of Hrs per genome varies
widely, from 1 to as many as 31 in Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum. One of the ChHrs from Magnetospirillum
gryphiswaldense (529aa, 197–329; CAJ30107|GI:7803349
0) has a central Hr domain. The remaining ChHrs vary in
length from about 250 to over 1100aa: of these 30 (36%)
have N-terminal, and 53 (64%) have C-terminal Hr
domains. The alignments of the foregoing sequences in

Fig. s2 of Additional file 1, show that 164 position are sufficient for the alignment of all Hr sequences, except for a
couple with interhelical inserts. The 262aa Hr from the αproteobacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum (YP_426610|GI:8
3592858) is unique in having two covalently linked Hr
domains.
The nonHr domains of the ChHs are very variable, with
about 20 still unidentified. Of the rest, GenBank identifies
32 as methyl accepting chemotactic proteins, followed by
16 GGDEF (metal-binding diguanylate cyclase) domains,
4 histidine kinase domains, 4 FOG:CheY-like domains,
and 7 combinations of GGDEF domain, 6 with a PAS and
one with an EAL domain. Examination of the O2 requirements of 97 Hr-containing bacteria in Table s3 (Additional file 1) did not reveal any correlation with Hr
presence: only 9 were host associated.
Altered Hr sequences
Table s4 in Additional file 1 lists the Hr sequences found
to deviate from the canonical Hr sequence, either through
alteration of one or more residues involved in iron coordination or loss of a helical segment: 58 out of the 327
bacterial sequences (18%) in 34 genomes, and one annelid. The alterations are listed in Table s5 in Additional file
1. Of the 59 deviant sequences, 11 have alterations in two
helices and 4 lack a helical segment. The number of alterations in each of the four helices A, B, C and D, is 10, 11,
45 and 6, respectively. The overwhelming majority are
substitutions of one of the 5 His residues whose sidechain groups coordinate the Fe atoms; only 5 alterations
in the two acidic residues are evident. Most are found in
helix C (45/71 = 63%), with several co-occurring with

alterations in one other helix. The most common His substitutions are by Gln (24/71 = 34%), by a hydrophobic
residue (A/V/L/I/M/Y) (19/71 = 27%), by Asn (7/71 =
10%) and by Glu/Asp (7/71 = 10%).
Molecular phylogeny
A global Bayesian phylogenetic tree of 92 Hr sequences,
comprising 42 metazoan, 3 protozoan, 16 fungal and 31
prokaryote Hrs, is shown in Fig. 2. Independent clusters
are formed by the prokaryote and fungal Hrs on one hand,
and the apicomplexan, heterolobosan and metazoan Hrs
on the other, supported by a posterior probability of 0.88.
In the prokaryote clade there is extensive polytomy which
does not allow discrimination between archaea and bacteria. Furthermore, the putative fungal Hrs are closely
clustered with the prokaryote Hrs with a posterior probability of 1. In the eukaryote branch, the apicomplexan
(Plasmodium yoelii) and the heterolobosan (N. fowleri and
N. gruberi) Hrs are basal to the protostome phyla, also
with high posterior probabilities. The annelid, sipunculan, brachiopod and cnidarian (N. vectensis) Hrs are not
resolved into individual clades. Furthermore, there is also
a polytomy at the base of the metazoan clade, including
the cnidarian Hr, expected to occur at the base of the Bilateria, together with several annelid Hrs. It should be
pointed out that Bayesian phylogenetic trees constructed
using subsets of the total number of Hr sequences, also
gave topologies identical to that obtained above (see Figs.
s3 and s4 in Additional file 1).

and 42 metazoan sequences. The Hr sequences are identified by the fist three letter of the genus name and the first three
letters of the species name (see Fig. s2 in Additional file 1). The archaeal Hrs are marked by a star and the N. vectensis Hr is
marked with a dot.

Discussion
Distribution and function in eukaryotes
The distribution of Hrs in eukaryotes is limited to fungi,
the apicomplexan Plasmodium yoelii, the heterolobosan
Naegleria and five metazoan phyla- the cnidarian N. vectensis, annelids and three minor phyla, the sipunculans,
brachiopods and priapulids. The presence of Hrs in all
three major annelid groups, the hirudinae, oligochaetes
and polychaetes, suggests that they may be ubiquitous in
Annelida. However, given their absence in the genome of
the polychaete Capitella sp.I, the extent of Hr occurrence in
annelids remains to be determined.

The intron-exon structures of the MHr and Hr genes of S.
nudus suggest that they emerged via a duplication event.
Although no oligochaete Hr gene structure is known to

date, the identical polychaete and hirudinean intron locations supports the notion of a common Hr ancestor to the
sipunculans and annelids [14]. The presence of a third
intron in some members of the H. robusta multigenic Hr
family suggests an intron gain during the emergence of
this species. The presence of two introns in N. vectensis Hr,
inserted in positions different from the other metazoan
Hrs (Fig. 1), indicates a different evolution of Hr genes in
the Radiata relative to the Bilateria. Overall, it appears that
the Hr gene was lost in the ancestor to the deuterostomes
and conserved only in a few protostomes after the Radiata-Bilateria transition and the protostome-deuterostome
split. The unexpected identification of signal peptide
cleavage sites in some Hrs from the leech H. robusta (Fig.
1), implies that these Hrs are directly released into coelomic or vascular compartments, similar to the extracellu-

lar annelid hemoglobins [25]: to our knowledge this is the
first known instance of possible extracellular Hr location.
The Hrs in circulating, nucleated coelomocytes within the
coelomic and tentacular fluid compartments and the cytoplasmic MHrs in Sipuncula, Brachiopoda, Priapulida and
the polychaete Magelona papillicornis, have O2 binding
properties consonant with physiological roles of O2 transport and storage [4,26]. Since annelids generally have
intracellular or extracellular Hbs or both [27], their Hrs
are likely to have functions other than O2 transport. The
Hrs of the polychaete N. diversicolor and the oligochaete A.
caliginosa have been proposed to function as scavengers of
heavy metals, such as Cd [8,9,28] and an antibacterial
function has been proposed for the former [29]. In the
leech Hirudo medicinalis, Hr occurs in neural and other tissues and is upregulated in response to septic injury [12].
A Hr was identified as a major component of mature
oocytes in the leech T. tessulatum [30]: its presence
throughout oogenesis suggests a more complex function
than just a nutrient for the embryo, perhaps in iron storage and detoxification. In the leech H. medicinalis, Hr
plays a role in the innate immune response of the nervous
system to bacterial invasion [11]. The binding of sulfide
by the Hr in the hemolymph of the priapulid Halicryptus
spinulosus [31], suggests a possible role in sulfide detoxification. Hrs are also antigenic [32]: the Hr in the amoeba
N. fowlerii was discovered in a search for the antigenrelated activity of this parasite [12].
Distribution and function in prokaryotes
Our survey demonstrates the presence of putative Hrs in <
10% of archaeal genomes (4 out of 43) and in < 30% of
bacterial genomes (118 out of 444). In Archaea, Hrs
occurs only in one of the two major groups, the Euryarchaea, and only in the Halobacteria, Methanococci and
Methanomicrobia. In Bacteria, about 80% of the genomes
containing Hrs belong to the Proteobacteria. Furthermore, we find that one of 6 archaeal and about one fifth
(18%) of the putative bacterial Hr sequences have one or
more alterations potentially affecting the integrity of the
diiron binding site. Although we do not know how many
of the altered sequences listed in Table s4 in Additional
file 1 retain their function, we are left with a very sparse
and episodic distribution of Hrs among the prokaryotes,
of which one fifth appear to have mutated away from the
canonical Hr motif. The overwhelming majority of the
altered sequences are single domain Hrs, implying that
their function may be less important to the survival of the
organism than the chimeric Hrs.

Karlsen et al. [17] have cloned the gene for a 131aa Hr
from the methanotrophic γ-proteobacterium M. capsulatus, and found that its in vivo expression increased with
increase in the copper content of the growth medium,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/244

implying a possible function as O2-provider to the O2requiring, membrane-associated methane monooxygenase, the enzyme responsible for oxidizing methane in M.
capsulatus grown at high copper concentrations. Although
nothing is known about the role of other SDHrs in bacteria, the 959aa ChHr from the sulfate-reducing δ-ptoteobacterium D. vulgaris, has been shown to be a chemotactic
protein with a C-terminal Hr domain [34]. Chemotactic
proteins generally comprise a periplasmic N-terminal sensor domain, linked via a trans-membrane domain to a Cterminal cytoplasmic transmitter domain. A phosphorylation/methylation cascade triggered by an environmental
stimulus is transduced from the sensor to the transmitter
domain, resulting in an alteration of the flagellar motion,
allowing movement up or down a concentration gradient
of the stimulus [35,36]. D. vulgaris is microaerobic and
prefers to swim to a specific O2 concentration range [37].
On the basis of a crystal structure of the expressed Hr
domain of DcrH, and consistent with its cytoplasmic
localization, Kurtz et al. [18] proposed that DcrH functions as an anaerotactic O2 sensor. There appear to be at
least three more putative chimeric proteins with C-terminal Hr domains as well as two SDHrs in D. vulgaris (Table
s3 in Additional file 1).
One final interesting observation resulting from our survey, is the presence of multiple SDHrs and ChHrs in the
genomes of several magnetotactic bacteria, e.g. Magnetococcus sp., Magnetospirillum magneticum and M. magnetotacticum, with 14 (6SDHrs, 8ChHrs), 37 (27SDHrs,
10ChHrs) and 31 (22SDHrs, 9ChHrs) Hrs, respectively
(Table s3 in Additional file 1), also observed earlier [33].
There are however, many magnetotactic bacteria which
apparently do not have Hrs. Magnetotaxis, the ability to
align and move along geomagnetic field lines, enables
bacteria to be more efficient in locating a desired position
in the vertical O2concentration gradient in their aquatic
environments: it depends on the presence of specialized
organelles, magnetosomes, comprised of Fe3O4/Fe3S4
crystals enclosed in a lipid bilayer membrane derived
from the cytoplasmic membrane [38,39]. It remains to be
determined whether Hrs have any role in magnetosome
formation or function.
Overall our results are in agreement with the results of a
very recent review of bacterial Hrs by French et al. [33],
published while this manuscript was in preparation.
These authors suggest that single domain Hrs may function in the delivery of O2 to oxygenases and respiratory
oxidases, implied by the findings of Karlsen et al. [17] and
consonant with the retention by the bacterial Hrs of the
complete molecular signature of the O2 binfing Hrs in
sipunculans and brachiopods.

Molecular phylogeny and evolution of Hrs
The global Bayesian phylogenetic tree shown in Fig. 2,
shows that the Opisthokont (animal and fungal) Hrs do
not cluster together, as would be expected according to the
consensus phylogeny of Baldauf [40]. Furthermore, the
metazoan Hrs group together with two evolutionarily distant groups, the Alveolates (Apicomplexa) and the Discicristates (Heterolobosa) [41]. The clustering of fungal Hrs
with the bacterial sequences suggests the possibility of
horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to fungi. Alternatively, the Long Branch attraction effect during the molecular phylogeny reconstruction process could have resulted
in an artefactual clustering with bacteria [42]. The radial
phylogenetic tree representation with distances provided
in Fig. 3, clearly shows the long distance separating the
fungal and prokaryote clusters.

respectively. In particular, the ~13% Hr presence in
eukaryotes is greatly exaggerated because of the overrepresentation of fungi in the sequenced eukaryote genomes.
Furthermore, unlike Hrs, globins are found in every major
bacterial group, occur widely in eukaryotes and are ubiquitous among plants and vertebrates. Compared to globins, Hrs have barely maintained a foothold in living
organisms, particularly multicellular ones. The apparent
lack of evolutionary success of Hrs versus globins could be
due to the greater probability of potentially damaging
mutations in the former relative to the latter: seven residues binding the two Fe versus only the proximal His
binding to the heme group. Alterations affecting one or
more of the Fe-coordinating amino acid residues as well
as the structure of the O2-binding cavity can be expected
to have a direct deleterious effect on Hr function [45].

It is plausible to assume that α-helical bundles were
among the earliest protein folds to emerge since the
beginning of life, well-adapted to the binding of metal
ions and small organic molecules. Consequently, both
Hrs and globins are two very ancient protein families,
which emerged as adaptations to possible environmental
challenges to the last universal common ancestor (LUCA)
or populations of microbial organisms representing
LUCA. These adaptations would include the need to
sequester reduced iron, which was probably abundant on
early Earth, the ability to control locally excessive O2 concentrations, which would have been lethal to anaerobic
life, and the need to detoxify nitric oxide produced in O2rich environments [43]. Another, equally plausible early
function, would have been chemotactic sensing, enabling
anaerobic organisms to avoid high O2 concentrations;
both aerophilic and aerophobic responses would have
survival value throughout bacterial evolution (K. Van
Holde, personal communication). This alternative is supported by the presence of chemotactic Hr-containing proteins and of globin-coupled sensors capable of eliciting
either an aerophilic or aerophobic response [44]. However, only 39 of 118 (33%) Hr-containing bacterial
genomes have ChHrs (Table s4 in Additional file 1) and
93 of 264 (35%) globin-containing bacterial genomes
have globin-coupled sensors [43]. Thus, in extant prokaryotes, chemotactic sensing appears not to be a major function in the two protein families; what then is the function
of the single domain Hrs in prokaryotes? The similarity of
the amino acid sequences of the prokaryote and metazoan
Hrs indicates that O2 binding is likely to be involved in the
function of the former, mentioned earlier [33].

Conclusion

Comparison of the phylogenomic profile of Hrs and globins (2), underscores the contrast in the evolutionary fates
of the two protein families: presence in < 10% versus 25%
of archaeal genomes, < 20% versus ~60% of bacterial
genomes and ~13% versus > 80% of eukaryote genomes,

A survey of putative Hrs demonstrated a limited occurrence in bacteria and archaea and a marked absence in the
vast majority of multicellular organisms. Among the
metazoa, Hrs have survived in a cnidarian and in a few
protostome groups; hence, it appears that in metazoans
the Hr gene was lost in deuterostome ancestor(s) after the
radiata/bilateria split. Signal peptide sequences in several
Hirudinea Hrs suggest for the first time, the possibility of
extracellular localization. Since the α-helical bundle is
likely to have been among the earliest protein folds, Hrs
represent an ancient family of iron-binding proteins,
whose primary function in bacteria may have been that of
an oxygen sensor, enabling aerophilic or aerophobic
responses. Although Hrs evolved to function as O2 transporters in brachiopods, priapulids and sipunculans, their
function in annelids remains to be elucidated. Overall Hrs
exhibit a considerable lack of evolutionary success in
metazoans.

Methods
Identification of Hr squences
Two approaches were used to identify putative Hrs in the
genomes of 37 archaea, 440 bacteria and 135 eukaryotes.
In one, we examined the gene assignments based on a
library of hidden Markov models [46], listed on the
SUPERFAMILY site http://supfam.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,
discarding sequences shorter than 100aa. In the other, we
performed blastp and tblastn (version 9.2.2) and psiblast
searches, using the improved version with composition
based statistics [47], of completed and unfinished
genomes in the GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
BLAST/. In cases of borderline sequences, searches
employing PFAM [48]http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk and
FUGUE [22]http://tardis.nibio.go.jp/fugue were used to
determine whether they should be accepted as a Hr.

Alignment of Hr sequences
The sequences were aligned using MUSCLE [49] and
MAFFT [50], with an iterative refinement option incorporating local pairwise alignment information http://
www.biophys.kyoto-u.ac.jp/, and manually, using the
conserved Hr motif generated by the structural alignment
employing MUSTANG [51] and shown in Fig. s1 in Additional file 1: -W-12X-D-2X-H-K-X-L-F/V-<variable>-L-6XH-F-2X-E-2X-L-M-<variable>-HK-2X-H-F-I/L/V-<variable>-WLV-X-H-I-3X-D-2X-Y-3X-L/V.
Biological Material
Specimens of the hydrothermal vent tube worm, R. pachyptila, were collected on the EPR (9_50¡N at the Riftia
Field site) at a depth of about 2500 m, during the French
oceanographic cruise HOT 96 and the American cruise
LARVE'99. The worms were sampled using the telemanipulated arms of the submersibles Nautile and Alvin,
brought back alive to the surface inside a temperatureinsulated basket, and immediately frozen and stored in
liquid nitrogen after their recovery on board. Live specimens of the polychaete Scoloplos armiger were collected at
the Station Biologique de Roscoff (France) and stored in
liquid nitrogen. Coelomic erythrocytes from Sipunculus
nudus were isolated from living worms provided from the
Station Biologique de Roscoff (France).
Total RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis
Erythrocytes from coelomic fluids of S. nudus were separated by centrifugation for 5 min at 2000 g and homogenized in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using
Trizol Reagent (Gibco). Reverse transcription was initiated directly on total RNA, without further purification,
with the oligo dT CTC CTC TCC TCT CCT CTT recommended by the Promega reverse transcriptase kit protocol.
Moreover, a pool of total RNA was extracted from the
intestinal tube tissue of S. nudus to synthesize a second
cDNA template.
Hr Primer Design
Degenerate forward and reverse Hr-specific primers were
designed according to an amino acid sequence multiple
alignment obtained from the Hr sequences available in
the Swiss-Prot database: Phascolopsis gouldii (P02244),
Themiste zostericola (P02245), T. dyscriptum (P02246), and
Siphonosoma cumanense (P22766). The following two
primers–HR3A, 5'-DAT YTT NCC YTT RTA YTT RAA RTC3' (forward), and HR5A, 5'-GGN TTY CCN ATD CCN GAY
CC-3' (reverse) (MGW Biotech)–were then used for PCRs
using a cDNA template.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/244

for 5 min, then 35 cycles consisting of 96°C for 50s, 50°C
for 50s, and 72°C for 50s. The reaction was completed by
an elongation step of 10 min at 72°C.
Amplifications were carried out in 25 μl reaction mixtures
containing 10–50 ng of cDNA target, 50–100 ng of each
degenerate primer, 200 μM dNTPs, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 1
unit of TaqDNA polymerase (Promega). PCR products
were visualized on a 1% agarose (Eurobio) gel under UV
radiation. Gel slices containing DNA fragments of the
expected size (~200 bp) were collected and subsequently
purified onto Ultrafree-DA (Millipore). PCR products
were then cloned using a TOPO-TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). Purified plasmids containing the Hr insert were sent
to the Biotechnology Center CRIBI (University of Padua,
Italy) for sequencing. The 3' and 5' end coding sequences
were obtained by RACE 5'/3' (Roche) following the protocols provided with the kit.
Molecular Phylogenetic Analysis
Bayesian phylogenetic trees were obtained using MrBayes
Version 3.1.2 (52); four chains were run simultaneously
for 3 × 106 generations and trees were sampled every 100
generations. The Jones transition matrix (53) was selected
and used as the model of amino acid substitution. The
final average standard deviation of split frequencies was
0.013.
