Abstract
Background: Freshwater fish absorb Ca2+ predominantly from ambient water, and more than
97% of Ca2+ uptake is achieved by active transport through gill mitochondrion-rich (MR) cells. In
the current model for Ca2+ uptake in gill MR cells, Ca2+ passively enters the cytosol via the
epithelium Ca2+ channel (ECaC), and then is extruded into the plasma through the basolateral Na+/
Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) and plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA). However, no convincing
molecular or cellular evidence has been available to support the role of specific PMCA and/or NCX
isoforms in this model. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a good model for analyzing isoforms of a gene
because of the plentiful genomic databases and expression sequence tag (EST) data.
Results: Using a strategy of BLAST from the zebrafish genome database (Sanger Institute), 6
isoforms of PMCAs (PMCA1a, PMCA1b, PMCA2, PMCA3a, PMCA3b, and PMCA4) and 7 isoforms
of NCXs (NCX1a, NCX1b, NCX2a, NCX2b, NCX3, NCX4a, and NCX4b) were identified. In the
reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, 5 PMCAs and 2 NCXs were
ubiquitously expressed in various tissues including gills. Triple fluorescence in situ hybridization and
immunocytochemistry showed the colocalization of zecac, zpmca2, and zncx1b mRNAs in a portion
of gill MR cells (using Na+-K+-ATPase as the marker), implying a subset of ionocytes specifically
responsible for the transepithelial Ca2+ uptake in zebrafish gills. The gene expressions in gills of
high- or low-Ca2+-acclimated zebrafish by quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that zecac
was the only gene regulated in response to environmental Ca2+ levels, while zpmcas and zncxs
remained steady.
Conclusion: The present study provides molecular evidence for the specific isoforms of Ca2+
transporters, zECaC, zPMCA2, and zNCX1b, supporting the current Ca2+ uptake model, in which
ECaC may play a role as the major regulatory target for this mechanism during environmental
challenge.

Background
Ca2+ is an essential element for almost all organisms and
plays comprehensive regulatory roles in eukaryotic cells;
therefore, Ca2+ must be maintained within a narrow concentration range in organisms (cellular free [Ca2+]: 100
nM; plasma total [Ca2+]: 2~3 mM). In terrestrial vertebrates, the whole-body Ca2+ balance is mainly achieved by
intestinal absorption and kidney reabsorption. Ca2+
uptake mechanisms in the mammalian kidney have been
most extensively studied, while fish gills, a specialized
organ in non-mammalian vertebrates, is another model
for studying Ca2+ uptake mechanisms [1]. In fish, gills are
the main site (> 97% of the whole body) of Ca2+ uptake
from the aquatic environment to maintain the Ca2+ balance [2], and skin takes the place of gills during early
developmental stages when the gills are not yet developed
and functioning [3-5]. Compared with terrestrial vertebrates, Ca2+ regulation mechanisms in aquatic animals are
probably more complicated and challenging because of
the dramatic fluctuations in ambient Ca2+ concentrations
which can occur (seawater, around 10 mM; fresh water,
0.01~3 mM).
According to the current model in mammals, active and
transcellular Ca2+ transport is carried out as a 3-step process [1]. Following entry of Ca2+ through apical epithelial
Ca2+ channels (ECaC, TRPV5, and/or TRPV6), Ca2+ is
bound to calbindins that facilitate diffusion to the basolateral membrane, and then it is extruded via the plasma
membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) and/or Na+/Ca2+
exchanger (NCX). In this way, net transepithelial Ca2+
absorption from the luminal compartment (or environment) to the plasma is accomplished. A model of the
capability of physiological regulation has also been similarly proposed in fish gills [6]. However, only very little
molecular evidence is currently available to support this
model in fish gills, which is a specialized organ for Ca2+
uptake. The ecac gene has recently been cloned and
sequenced in fugu, zebrafish, and trout [4,7,8]. In
zebrafish embryos, low-Ca2+ fresh water causes upregulation of the whole-body Ca2+ influx and zECaC expression
in mitochondrion-rich (MR) cells of both gills and skin,
providing molecular evidence for the role of ECaC in fish
Ca2+ uptake [4]. On the other hand, some biochemical
and physiological studies have investigated the possibility
of PMCA and NCX's involvement in fish gill Ca2+ uptake
[9,10]. Nevertheless, no convincing evidence has been
presented demonstrating the existence and involvement
of PMCA and NCX in fish Ca2+ uptake mechanisms.
Three NCX genes (SLC8A1, SLC8A2, and SLC8A3) and 4
PMCA genes (ATP2B1, ATP2B2, ATP2B3, and ATP2B4)
have been identified in mammals so far. The fundamental
work of PMCA is the highly regulated active extrusion of
Ca2+ from cells for maintaining a gradient across the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/354

plasma membrane [11]. PMCA belongs to the P-type primary ion transport ATPase superfamily with 10 transmembrane domains and 1 calmodulin-binding site. At
least 20 alternative splicing variants of PMCA have been
found in mammals [12]. In mammals, PMCA1 and
PMCA4 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas PMCA2 and
PMCA3 are more tissue specific; it has been suggested that
PMCA1 and PMCA4 are housekeeping isoforms involved
in the maintenance of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis [13].
However, no molecular data about PMCAs are available
in fish. On the other hand, at least 32 alternatively spliced
isoforms of NCX1 gene products have been identified
[14]. Knock-out of NCX1 in mice is lethal due to cardiac
defects before birth [15], while many physiological studies have indicated that vitamin D3 modulates Ca2+ balance
by upregulating NCX1 expression [16]. Recently, NCX1-3
and NCX4, another putative prototype of NCX, have been
reported in fish, indicating the existence of NCXs in nonmammals as well [17,18]. However, there is no molecular
physiological evidence to support the involvement of
NCX in fish Ca2+ uptake mechanisms.
Because of a theoretical process of whole-genome duplication (WGD) from ancestor vertebrates [19,20], the numbers of gene isoforms found in teleosts are usually more
than those found in mammals and tetrapods. While different isoforms coded from distinct genomic loci tend to
have tissue-specific expressions, there are some cases of
isoforms being differentially regulated upon facing environmental changes (reviewed by Schulte [21]. Isoforms
also serve compensatory functions; upregulation of
TRPV6 was found in the kidneys of TRPV5-deficient mice
[22]. In biochemical studies on fish, the gill activities of
PMCA and NCX, which are altered based upon physiological needs and environmental changes, have been proposed as being associated with transepithelial Ca2+
transport [9,23]. However, nothing is known about which
specific isoforms are responsible for Ca2+ uptake mechanisms in teleost gills. Therefore, using a functional
genomic approach to investigate all isoforms of PMCA
and NCX in a species may provide both physiological and
genomic insights into this issue.
In the present study, a strategy of a whole-genome survey
was used to uncover any unidentified PMCA and NCX isoforms in zebrafish, and then these candidates were refined
with the EST database and cloned. Six isoforms of PMCAs
(PMCA1a, PMCA1b, PMCA2, PMCA3a, PMCA3b, and
PMCA4) and 7 isoforms of NCXs (NCX1a, NCX1b,
NCX2a, NCX2b, NCX3, NCX4a, and NCX4b) were identified. Moreover, we report that some duplication of PMCA
and NCX occurred, and the tissue distributions and
expression patterns of these isoforms were analyzed by
reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
and triple fluorescence labeling, respectively. The gene

expressions in gills of zebrafish acclimated to high- or
low-Ca2+ environments were also examined by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. The present study provides
molecular evidence to support the current Ca2+ uptake
model in fish gill cells [24].

Results
Molecular cloning and bioinformatics analysis of pmca
and ncx
In this whole-genome survey, 6 distinct PMCAs (Figure 1)
and 7 distinct NCXs (Figure 2) were found in zebrafish.
According to the phylogenetic analysis, these transporters
were annotated as zPMCA1a, zPMCA1b, zPMCA2,
zPMCA3a, zPMCA3b, zPMCA4 (Figure 3a, and in standard nomenclature ATP2B1a, ATP2B1b, ATP2B2,
ATP2B3a, ATP2B3b, and ATP2B4, respectively) and
zNCX1a, zNCX1b, zNCX2a, zNCX2b, zNCX3, zNCX4a,
and zNCX4b (Figure 3b, in standard nomenclature
SLC8a1a, SLC8a1b, SLC8a2a, SLC8a2b, SLC8a3,
SLC8a4a, and SLC8a4b, respectively). zNCX1a and
zNCX1b were previously described and named zNCX1h
and zNCX1n, respectively [25], and zNCX2a, zNCX3,
zNCX4a, and zNCX4b have also been published [17,18].
However, zNCX2b and the other zPMCAs are first
described in this study.

Based on the topological structures of PMCA and NCX
summarized in mammals [12,26], zebrafish PMCAs and
NCXs share similar patterns as mammals at the deduced
amino acid sequences. According to the hydropathy analysis, 10 putative transmembrane domains were predicted
for zPMCA (Figures 1, 4a), whereas NCX has 11 hydrophobic segments and 9 putative transmembrane domains
(Figures 2, 4b) due to an intracellular helix front transmembrane domain 6 and a P loop-like structure of hydrophobic segment 8, which contained the amino acid
sequence "GIG" [26]. PMCA and sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), the closest kin to PMCA,
share a similar topological structure: hydrophobic segments span the membrane 10 times, and 3 intracellular
loops consist of Ca2+ binding and transporting, and calmodulin-regulating functions [12,27]; the zPMCAs were
also found to have 3 cytoplasmic domains 1 each between
TM2 and TM3, TM4 and TM5, and TM10 and the C-terminal (Figure 1). As for NCX, a large intracellular loop for
ion translocation [28,29] was located between TM5 and
TM6 (Figure 2). There were 20 alternative splicing isoforms of zPMCAs found when cloning was conducted,
while 9 alternative splicing isoforms were found in zNCXs
(data not shown). The hot spots of alternative splicing
regions in the zPMCAs are at the 5' untranslated regions
(UTRs), the fragments around the 300th amino acid
including from 1 to 3 small exons (less than 100 bp each
in those cases), and 3' amino acid tails that usually stretch
to the 3' UTR and alter the location of stop codons. On the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/354

other hand, a region of alternative splicing sites was found
in zNCX1b and zNCX3 around the 610th amino acid,
which is a part of the intracellular loop.
zPMCAs share 63%~86% identities with each other, while
zNCXs exhibit higher variety among isoforms (i.e.,
36%~76% identity). According to the phylogenetic analysis, zebrafish and 2 pufferfish species so far all have 6
PMCA and 7 NCX isoforms (Figure 3a,b). Compared with
the isoforms annotated in tetrapods, duplication from the
ancestor ray-finned fish occurred in PMCA1, PMCA3,
NCX1, NCX2, and NCX4, according to the latest version
of the genomic database utilized. Moreover, in the karyotype, zPMCAs and zNCXs are located on different chromosomes (see additional file 1), suggesting that these
paralogous groups may have originated from genome
duplication but not from tandem duplication. Relationships among these pairs of duplicates were evident not
only in the phylogenetic tree, but also in their gene structures (Figure 4). All teleost PMCAs and NCXs examined in
this study showed an outgroup topology to their orthologues of mammals (Figure 3a,b), and the paralogous teleosts formed an inner-group topology. The 2 prototypes
of NCXs, NCX4a and NCX4b, found in teleosts were most
closely related to NCX1 and NCX3 in both phylogenetic
trees (Figure 3) and gene structures (Figure 4b). In gene
structures, all of them had a relatively large first exon, even
though some small introns were found in the split exons
in zNCX4s (Figure 4b).
mRNA expressions of pmca and ncx in various tissues
RT-PCR analysis revealed that zpmca2 and zpmca4 were
ubiquitously expressed in various tissues compared with
zpmca1a, zpmca1b, zpmca3a, and zpmca3b (Figure 5). All
zpmcas were abundant in the brain and eye except
zpmca1b, which was mainly expressed in the eye. These
findings agree with the Ca2+ homeostasis function of
PMCAs found in the mammalian neuron system [12].
zncx1b and zncx4a were also ubiquitously expressed, while
zncx2b and zncx3 were only detected in the brain and eyes.
zpmca1a, zpmca1b, zpmca2, zpmca3a, and all the zncxs were
expressed in ovary and 1-cell embryo (Figure 5), suggesting that these genes may regulate intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis at earlier stages. zpmca1a, zpmca2, zpmca4, zncx1,
and zncx4a were expressed in gills (Figure 5).
Effects of environmental Ca2+ levels on ecac, pmca, and
ncx mRNA expressions
According to the quantitative real time-PCR analysis, lowCa2+ FW-acclimated zebrafish expressed significantly
higher levels of zecac in gills than did high-Ca2+ FW-acclimated fish (Figure 6). However, no significant difference
was found between the 2 groups in the expressions of any
of the zpmcas and zncxs (Figure 6). Consistent with the
results of the tissue scans shown in Figure 5, zpmca4,

expressed zpmca2 and zncx1b mRNAs than zecac mRNA
(Figure 7AâF). Notably, zpmca2 and zncx1b were also

Fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry were used to determine the isoforms of zpmca and
zncx that were specifically expressed in gill ionocytes. Specific mRNA probes of all of the zpmca and zncx isoforms
were used to conduct the in situ hybridizations for wholemount embryos and adult gills. Among the isoforms, only
zpmca2 and zncx1b mRNA signals were found in specific
groups of cells in embryonic skin and adult gills (data not

n = 3), while only 40.3 +/- 1.35% (n = 3) of zpmca2-positive cells showed zecac signals (Figures 7AâC, 8). Similar
results were found in the case of double labeling of zecac
and zncx1b (Figures 7DâF, 8). The proportion of zncx1bpositive cells that co-expressed zecac was 77.1 +/- 1.35%
(n = 3), while zncx1b signals could be detected in all zecacpositive cells (Figures 7DâF, 8).
The subsequent triple-labeling experiments further demonstrated the colocalization of zecac mRNA/zpmca2
mRNA/Na+-K+-ATPase (Figure 8AâE), and zecac mRNA/
zncx1b mRNA/Na+-K+-ATPase (Figure 8FâJ), respectively,
in specific groups of gill ionocytes. Taken all together,
only a portion of gill ionocytes co-expressed the mRNA of
zecac, zpmca2, and zncx1b, and Na+-K+-ATPase.

Discussion
So far, 4 PMCA genes have been identified in mammals,
and PMCA1 and PMCA4 were suggested to be housekeeping isoforms. Mammalian PMCA2 was found to be
expressed in the hair bundle of hair cells of the inner ear
[30], suggesting that it is responsible for endolymph Ca2+

homeostasis [11]. A null mutation of PMCA2 caused balance and hearing defects in mice [31]. On the other hand,
mammalian PMCA1 was deemed a major Ca2+ extrusion
transporter for Ca2+ absorption in intestine and kidney
[32-34]. Our data demonstrated opposite phenomena in
fish PMCAs. zpmca2 was expressed with a housekeeping
pattern (Figure 5), while zpmca1a showed a hair cell
expression pattern during embryonic stages (data not
shown). This functional substitution of paralogues found
in Ca2+ transporters is not a unique example. In zebrafish,
the expression profiles suggest the hypothesis that
zebrafish hoxB1a and hoxB1b are functional equivalents
of mouse Hoxb1 and Hoxa1, respectively. On the contrary, the zebrafish orthologue of mouse Hoxa1, zebrafish
hoxA1a, is not expressed in a similar pattern [20]. Further
examination of the promoter regions of these genes may
provide insights into this phenomenon. As far as our data,
zPMCA2 was proposed to participate in the transcellular
Ca2+ uptake pathway in fish gills. NCX1a and NCX1b
from teleosts including zebrafish and pufferfish were not
clustered within an inner group on the phylogenetic tree
(Figure 3). Further collection is necessary to enlarge the
sequence pool, which may allow us to reconstruct the
phylogenetic tree or to rename members of the gene family. In the present study, zNCX1b was demonstrated to be
responsible for the Ca2+ extrusion mechanism in fish gill
cells, while the paralogue, zNCX1a, was proven to be a
heart-specific isoform that causes cardiac fibrillations in
zNCX1a mutants [25]. The combined functions from
both zNCX1s are equivalent to those of mammalian
NCX1; however, investigations of the direct function of
NCX1 in Ca2+ absorption were not possible due to fatal
heart failure in knockout mice. Therefore, teleosts may
serve as a good model to examine the role of NCX in Ca2+
uptake without resulting heart failure.
As described above, Flik et al. [6] proposed a model of a
fish gill Ca2+uptake mechanism, which is similar to that
for Ca2+ reabsorption in mammalian kidneys [1]. There
has been no convincing or comprehensive molecular evidence to support the existence of the 3 major transporters,
ECaC, PMCA, and NCX, in fish gill ionocytes until the
present study. Pan et al. [4] for the first time demonstrated
the expression of zecac in a subset of MR cells in zebrafish
skin/gills and a correlation between zecac expression and
in vivo Ca2+ uptake function. Subsequently in rainbow
trout, Perry and colleagues found the expression of ECaC
mRNA and/or protein in both pavement and MR cells in
rainbow trout [8,35], which is inconsistent with the current view that MR cells are the predominant site for
branchial Ca2+ uptake [36], and the authors also reported
that hypercapnia, implantation with cortisol, and infusion with CaCl2 affected ECaC expression in MR cells and/
or pavement cells [35]. In a recent study on isolated trout
gill cells, PNA+ MR cells showed an over 3-fold higher

45Ca2+ uptake capacity compared to either PNA- MR or
pavement cells [37]. The subset of gill MR cells and/or
pavement cells that expressed ECaC is not necessarily
involved in transepithelial Ca2+ uptake as Hwang and Lee
[24] claimed, because those previous studies lacked
molecular and physiological data to demonstrate the
transport pathway across the basolateral membrane. The
present triple in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical experiments demonstrate the co-expressions of zecac,
zpmca2, and zncx1b in a specific group of gill MR cells, providing comprehensive molecular evidence for the involvement of these transporters in a fish gill Ca2+ uptake
mechanism.

Double in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry
experiments indicated that about 90% of gill MR cells
expressed zecac mRNA, although this may have been

underestimated because the antigenicity of Na+-K+ATPase (the marker for MR cells) is attenuated during the
high-temperature treatments used for in situ hybridization. All zecac-expressing cells co-expressed zncx1b, and
about half of the zecac-expressing cells co-expressed
zpmca2, indicating that about 50% of zecac-expressing
cells co-expressed both zncx1b and zpmca2. Taking all
these findings into account, only about 45% of the entire
population of MR cells co-express zecac, zpmca2, and
zncx1b, and this subset of ionocytes may specifically carry
out the function of transepithelial Ca2+ uptake in
zebrafish gills. It was noted that some gill cells express
only 1 or 2 (never all) of the 3 major Ca2+ transporters.
These cells may be in the process of terminal differentiation as Hsiao et al. [38] reported in skin ionocytes in
zebrafish embryos. Alternatively, the Ca2+ transporter(s)
expressed in those cells may be involved in intracellular

Ca2+ homeostasis or other cellular events [4,39,40]. This
remains to be confirmed in future studies.
ECaC is a vitamin D-sensitive transporter in mammals
[22], and the expression of PMCA1 was also found to be
stimulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 in mammals and chicken
[34,41,42]. 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D3 was shown to have a
hypercalcemic effect on both freshwater and saltwater teleosts [6,43], whereas stanniocalcin, a predominant
hypocalcemic hormone produced by Stannius bodies,
was found to show opposite effect on fish [44]. Stanniocalcin did not show a significant effect on basolateral Ca2+
transport [45], but quickly reduced the permeability of
Ca2+ at the apical membrane [6,46]. It has been proposed
that ECaC is the rate-limiting step and the gatekeeper
channel for active Ca2+ transport [47]. The present study
provides further molecular physiological evidence to support this notion. The present study for the first time demonstrates that acclimation to a low-Ca2+ environment,
which would stimulate Ca2+ uptake capacity in fish
[3,48,49], caused upregulation of mRNA expression of
zECaC but not zPMCA2 or zNCX1b, implying that the
steady-state expressions of zPMCA2 and zNCX1b may fulfill the requirement for the transepithelial transport
machinery under all situations. Moreover, this study provides molecular evidence to support a previous biochemical study by Flik et al. [50], who found that the
basolateral Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms by PMCA and
NCX is far below their maximum capacity in fish gills
based on the kinetic properties of the 2 enzymes.

Conclusion
The major findings of the present study were that (1) 6
PMCAs and 7 NCXs were identified from zebrafish tissues;
(2) differential expressions of these genes were found in
various tissues including gills; (3) acclimation to low-Ca2+
environment stimulated the mRNA expression of ecac in
gills, but not those of pmcas or ncxs; and (4) only a portion
of gill MR cells co-expressed zecac, zpmca2, and zncx1b
mRNAs.

Methods
Animals and embryos
Zebrafish (Danio rerio) brood stocks at the Institute of Cellular and Organismic Biology, Academia Sinica were kept
in fresh water (local tap water, FW) at 28.5Â°C under a 14h:10-h light: dark photoperiod. Embryos were collected
within 30 min after fertilization and incubated in a Petri
dish until the desired developmental stages. For wholemount in situ hybridization, PTU (1-phenyl 2-thiourea) at
a final concentration of 0.003% was added to prevent
melanogenesis. Fish were anesthetized with buffered
MS222 before sampling following the guidelines of the
Academia Sinica Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Committee (approval no.: RFiZOOHP2006086).

Acclimation experiment
Following a previous process in our laboratory [49], highCa2+ (2.00 mM, control) and low-Ca2+ (0.02 mM) artificial fresh waters were prepared with double-deionized
water (Milli-RO60, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) supplemented with adequate CaSO4Â·2H2O, MgSO4Â·7H2O,
NaCl, K2HPO4, and KH2PO4. Nominal Ca2+ concentrations of the high- and low-Ca2+ media were 2.00 and 0.02
mM, respectively, but the other ion concentrations of the
media were the same ([Na+], 0.5 mM; [Mg2+], 0.16 mM;
and [K+], 0.3 mM) as those in the local tap water. Variations in the ion concentrations were maintained within
10% of the predicted values by examination with an
atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Hitachi Z-8000,
Tokyo, Japan). Zebrafish were transferred to high- and
low-Ca2+ media, respectively, for 2 wk. At the end of acclimation, fish gills were sampled for quantitative real-time
PCR analysis.
Molecular cloning and sequences analysis
The peptide sequences from other species (teleost had a
higher priority) were used to BLAST the genome databases
(of NCBI and Ensembl) for zebrafish, pufferfish (Fugu
rubripes), and tetradon (Tetraodon nigroviridis). The putative full-length or partial open reading frames of PMCAs
and NCXs obtained were confirmed using the EST database, and/or were used to design primers for cloning and
the RT-PCR analysis. PCR products thus obtained were
subcloned into a pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA), and the nucleotide sequences were determined
with an ABI 377 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Sequence analysis was conducted with a
BLASTx program (NCBI). The specific primers of 5' and 3'rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) were designed
from the partial sequences obtained from the PCR with
degenerate primers. The RACE PCR program followed a
commercial protocol (Clontech, Mountain View, CA,
USA), and the RACE PCR products were also subcloned
into pGEM-T Easy vectors and sequenced. The full-length
deduced amino-acid sequences were aligned with ClustalX and then phylogenetically analyzed with Mega3.1
[51]. For the proteomic structure analysis, the hydropathy
plot and transmembranes were predicted with EMBOSS
(the European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite,
version 2.8.0 [52] algorithm according to Persson and
Argos [53].
RT-PCR analysis
An appropriate amount of zebrafish adult tissues was collected for the total RNA preparation with TRIZol reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The amount and quality
of total RNA were determined by measuring the absorbances at 260 and 280 nm with a spectrophotometer
(Hitachi U-2000) and RNA denatured gels. For cDNA synthesis, 5 Âµg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed in a final

reverse transcriptase III (Invitrogen) for 1.5 h at 42Â°C, followed by a 15-min incubation at 70Â°C. For the PCR
amplification, 1 ÂµL cDNA was used as a template in a 25ÂµL final reaction volume containing 0.25 mM dNTP, 1.25
units Gen-Taq polymerase (Genemark, Taipei, Taiwan),
and 0.2 ÂµM of each primer. The primer sets for the PCR of

5'-ACATTCTCGCCAGGTTTG-3'. A 514-bp fragment of
zebrafish beta-actin was used as an internal control to
evaluate the relative amounts of complementary DNAs
(cDNAs), and the design of the primer pairs followed
Hsiao et al. [54]. The amplicons were all sequenced to
make sure that the PCR products were the desired gene
fragments.
Fluorescence double in situ hybridization
Fragments of the target genes obtained by PCR were
inserted into pGEM-T Eeasy vectors. Digoxigenin- (Dig)
(Roche, Penzberg, Germany) or dinitrophenol (DNP)labeled (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA, USA) RNA probes
were synthesized by in vitro transcription with T7 and SP6
RNA polymerase (Takara, Shiga, Japan). The qualities of
the probes were examined using RNA gels, and the concentrations were determined by a dot-blot assay with
standard DIG-labeled RNA (100 ng/Âµl) (Roche). Excised
gills were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at
4Â°C and then washed several times with PBS. For the cryosections, fixed samples were immersed in PBS containing 30% sucrose overnight, and embedded in Optimal

Cutting Temperature (OCT) compound embedding
medium (Sakura, Tokyo, Japan) at -20Â°C, and 10-Âµm frozen cross-sections were cut with a CM 1900 rapid sectioning cryostat (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) and attached to
poly-L-lysine coated slides (Electron Microscopy Sciences,
Ft. Washington, PA, USA). Prepared samples from either
cryosections or methanol-dehydrated whole gills were
washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline with
0.1% tween-20 (PBST). After a brief washing with PBST,
samples were incubated with hybridization buffer (HyB)
containing 50% formamide, 5Ã SSC, and 0.1% Tween-20
for 5 min at 65Â°C. Prehybridization was performed for 2
h at 65Â°C with HyB+, which is the hybridization buffer
supplemented with 500 ng/mL yeast tRNA and 50 Âµg/mL
heparin. For hybridization, samples were incubated in
100 ng of the RNA probe in 200 ÂµL HyB+ at 65Â°C overnight. Then, slides were washed at 65Â°C for 10 min in
75% HyB and 25% 2Ã SSC, 10 min in 50% HyB and 50%
2Ã SSC, 10 min in 25% HyB and 75% 2Ã SSC, 10 min in
2Ã SSC, and 30 min for 2 times in 0.2Ã SSC at 70Â°C. Further washes were performed at room temperature for 5
min in 75% 0.2Ã SSC and 25% PBST, 5 min in 50% 0.2Ã
SSC and 50% PBST, 5 min in 25% 0.2Ã SSC and 75%
PBST, and 5 min in PBST. Fluorescence staining was conducted with a commercial kit, TSA Plus Fluorescence Systems (Perkin-Elmer). The hybridization signals detected
by the DIG-labeled RNA probes were amplified through
fluorescein-tyramide signal amplification (TSA), while
cyanine 3-TSA was used for the DNP-labeled probes. For
triple labeling, samples were first subjected to in situ
hybridizations of the 2 transporter genes and then to Na+/
K+-ATPase immunocytochemistry (see below).
Immunohistochemistry
Zebrafish embryos and gills were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4Â°C. After washing in PBS, fixed
embryos were treated with 100% ethanol for 10 min at 20Â°C and subsequently subjected to blocking with 3%
BSA at room temperature for 30 min. Embryos were then
incubated with 1:200 PBS-diluted mouse anti-chicken
Na+/K+-ATPase Î± subunit (cytosolic epitope for all isoforms) monoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa,
Iowa City, IA, USA) at room temperature for 2 h. Samples
were washed twice in PBS for 10 min each, and then incubated with 1:200 PBS-diluted goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Cy5 (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories,
West Grove, PA, USA) for 2 h at room temperature.
Images were acquired with a confocal laser scanning
microscope (TCS-SP5, Leica Lasertechnik, Heidelberg,
Germany).
Quantitative real-time PCR
Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was carried out using
a SYBR green dye (Applied Biosystems)-based assay with

an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied
Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Primers targeting Ca2+ transporters (see additional file 1)
and the endogenous control gene, beta-actin, were
designed using the Primer Express 2.0 software (Applied
Biosystems). In each assay, 25 ng cDNA was amplified in
a 20-ÂµL reaction containing 2x SYBR green master mix,
100 nM of forward and reverse primers, and nuclease-free
water. Beta-actin, with a 151-bp amplicon (forward 5'CACCTTCCAGCAGATGTGGA-3'
and
reverse
5'AAAAGCCATGCCAATGTTGTC-3'), was used as an internal control to construct the standard curves.
