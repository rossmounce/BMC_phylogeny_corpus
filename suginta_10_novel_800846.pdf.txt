Novel b-N-acetylglucosaminidases from Vibrio
harveyi 650: Cloning, expression, enzymatic
properties, and subsite identification

Abstract
Background: Since chitin is a highly abundant natural biopolymer, many attempts have been made to convert
this insoluble polysaccharide into commercially valuable products using chitinases and b-N-acetylglucosaminidases
(GlcNAcases). We have previously reported the structure and function of chitinase A from Vibrio harveyi 650. This
study t reports the identification of two GlcNAcases from the same organism and their detailed functional
characterization.
Results: The genes encoding two new members of family-20 GlcNAcases were isolated from the genome of
V. harveyi 650, cloned and expressed at a high level in E. coli. VhNag1 has a molecular mass of 89 kDa and an
optimum pH of 7.5, whereas VhNag2 has a molecular mass of 73 kDa and an optimum pH of 7.0. The recombinant
GlcNAcases were found to hydrolyze all the natural substrates, VhNag2 being ten-fold more active than VhNag1.
Product analysis by TLC and quantitative HPLC suggested that VhNag2 degraded chitooligosaccharides in a
sequential manner, its highest activity being with chitotetraose. Kinetic modeling of the enzymic reaction revealed
that binding at subsites (-2) and (+4) had unfavorable (positive) binding free energy changes and that the binding
pocket of VhNag2 contains four GlcNAc binding subsites, designated (-1),(+1),(+2), and (+3).
Conclusions: Two novel GlcNAcases were identified as exolytic enzymes that degraded chitin oligosaccharides,
releasing GlcNAc as the end product. In living cells, these intracellular enzymes may work after endolytic chitinases
to complete chitin degradation. The availability of the two GlcNAcases, together with the previously-reported
chitinase A from the same organism, suggests that a systematic development of the chitin-degrading enzymes
may provide a valuable tool in commercial chitin bioconversion.

Background
Chitin is a b-1,4-linked homopolymer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), which is found mainly in the exoskeleton of crustaceans, insects and in the cell walls of
fungi. Chitin is one of the most abundant polymers in
nature and its degradation derivatives are pharmaceutically valuable. for example, chitoligosaccharides can stimulate the immune system to respond to microbial
infections and chitin monomers have been shown to act
as anti-aging and anti-tumor agents, as well as to relieve
the symptoms of osteoarthritis [1-6]. Complete

degradation of chitin requires chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14)
and b-N-acetylglucosaminidases (GlcNAcases) or chitobiases (EC 3.2.1.52), so such enzymes could potentially
serve as biocatalysts in the production of chitin derivatives of desired sizes during the recycling of chitin
biomass.
As well as functioning in chitin degradation by bacteria, GlcNAcases are also known to be key enzymes in
the catabolism of glycoconjugates containing N-acetylglucosamine residues [7,8] and mutations of the gene
encoding a human GlcNAcase homologue (HexA) cause
a fatal genetic lipid storage disorder, known as TaySachs disease [9]. In the CAZy database (http://www.
cazy.org), GlcNAcases are classified into glycosyl hydrolases family 3 (GH-3) or family 20 (GH-20), which differ
in sequence and mode of enzyme action [10,11]. Family-3

GlcNAcases are thought to act by a standard retaining
mechanism involving a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate while family-20 enzymes employ a ‘substrateassisted’ mechanism involving the transient formation
of an oxazolinium ion intermediate [12-15]. Most of
the GlcNAcases described hitherto belong to the GH20 family. To date, only five bacterial GH-3 GlcNAcases have been characterized, including NagZ or ExoII
from Vibrio furnissii [16], Nag3A from Clostridium
paraputrificum M-2 [17], NagA from Streptomyces
thermoviolaceus [18], and NagA and CbsA from Thermotoga maritima and T. neapolitana [19].
Vibrio harveyi, formerly known as V. carchariae, is a
Gram-negative marine bacterium that causes luminous
Vibriosis, a serious disease that affects commercially
farmed fish and shellfish species [20,21]. We previously
reported isolation of the gene encoding endochitinase A
from Vibrio harveyi type strain 650 for functional and
structural characterization [22,23]. In this study, we
employed a homology-based strategy to isolate two
GlcNAcase genes from the genome of the same Vibrio
strain. Sequence analysis suggested that the resultant
polypeptides were new members of the GH-20 family.
Enzymic properties of the GlcNAcases expressed in E.
coli were investigated. Their kinetic properties and identification of the subsites in the more active enzyme are
discussed in further detail.

Results and Discussion
Gene isolation and sequence analysis

The availability of the complete genome sequence
allowed us to locate three open reading frames (ORFs),
including VIBHAR_03430 (Swiss-Prot: A7MYY8), VIBHAR_06345 (Swiss-Prot: A7N8P3) and, VIBHAR_01265
(Swiss-Prot: A7N1G4) in the genome of V. harveyi type
strain ATCC BAA-1116 BB120. These reading frames
encode uncharacterized proteins with presumed GlcNAcase activity. In an attempt to isolate the genes that
encode GlcNAcases in a closely-related organism, three
sets of oligonucleotides were designed based on the
above-mentioned ORFs. Two homologous DNAs were
amplified by the oligonucleotides designed from the
VIBHAR_03430 and VIBHAR_01265 ORFs, whereas the
DNA fragment compatible with the VIBHAR_06345
ORF could not be amplified successfully. Hence, the
first two DNA fragments (hereafter referred to as
VhNag1 and VhNag2) were further cloned and
expressed for functional characterization. Nucleotide
sequence analysis showed that the VhNag1 full-length
DNA contains 2,343 bp which encode a polypeptide of
88,849 Da, whereas the VhNag2 full-length DNA contains 1,926 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 73,143 Da.
The pI values of VhNag1 and VhNag2 were calculated
to be 4.9 and 5.4, respectively. The nucleotide and

Page 2 of 12

corresponding amino acid sequences of the newly-identified GlcNACases have been deposited in the GenBank/
EMBL/DDBJ database with assigned accession numbers
of HM175715 for VhNag1 and HM175716 for VhNag2.
Although a BLAST search indicated high sequence similarity of VhNag1 and VhNag2 to GlcNAcases from
other Vibrio species, most of these sequences turned out
to be only hypothetical proteins with predicted GlcNAcase activity. Low sequence similarity with all GH-3
members (< 12%) suggested that neither of these
enzymes belong to GH-3, but matches of up to 30%
with previously studied GH-20 enzymes indicated that
they are new GH-20 members. A sequence comparison
with eleven functionally-characterized GH-20 enzymes
(data not shown) shows that both VhNag sequences are
closest to the a-chain of human GlcNAcase (HuHexA,
30% similarity) [24], followed by Serratia marcescens
chitobiase (SmChb, 24%) [25]. Fig. 1 shows a sequence
alignment of VhNag1 and VhNag2 with three selected
GlcNAcases, including VhChb [26] (the only characterized GlcNAcase from V. harveyi), HuHexA and SmChb
(which have the highest sequence similarities to the
VhNag sequences). Since the structural details of
SmChb are well studied, further sequence comparisons
were with SmChb. As seen in Fig. 1, a number of consensus residues are identified, a few of which may participate in the catalytic function of the Vibrio
GlcNAcases. The most obvious of these are the acidic
pairs Asp287-Glu288 (in VhNag1) or Asp437-Glu438 (in
VhNag2) (Fig. 1, red asterisks) as they are completely
aligned with Asp539-Glu540 of SmChb. These two residues were previously shown to be crucial for the catalytic function of SmChb, Glu540 acting as the catalytic
residue [13,25]. Other residues found to be involved in
binding the substrate in the enzyme-substrate complex
of SmChb-diNAG include Asp346, Arg349, Asp378,
Asp379, Trp616, Trp685, and Trp737. These residues
are completely conserved among the GlcNAcase species
(Fig. 1, blue dots).
Recombinant expression and mass identification

The full-length VhNAg1 and VhNag2 DNAs were subsequently cloned into the pQE60 expression vector,
which provides high-level expression in E. coli M15 of
C-terminally (His) 6 -tagged polypeptides. The overall
yields of the purified recombinant proteins obtained
after Ni-NTA affinity chromatography were 5 - 10 mg/
ml of bacterial culture. Fig. 2A shows SDS-PAGE analysis, displaying a single band of VhNag1 migrating to
slightly below the 96 kDa marker and VhNag2 closer 66
kDa. The molecular masses estimated from their mobilities are consistent with the theoretical masses of the
enzymes (88,849 Da for VhNag1 and 73,143 Da for
VhNag2). In peptide mass fingerprinting, 9 and 13

Figure 1 Amino acid sequence alignment of five GH-20 GlcNAcases. The sequence alignment was generated by CLUSTAL W and displayed
by Genedoc. The amino acid sequence of S. marcescens chitobiase: SmChb (Swiss-Prot: Q54468) was aligned with the corresponding sequence
HuHexA: the a-chain of human hexosaminidase (Swiss-Prot: P06865), V. harveyi chitobiase: VhChb (Swiss-Prot: P13670), V. harveyi 650 VhNag1
(GenBank: HM175715) and VhNag2 (GenBank: HM175716). The acidic pair important for enzyme catalysis is marked with red asterisks. The
residues responsible for diNAG binding are marked with blue dots. Arrows indicate the first and the last residues in the catalytic domain of
SmChb.

VhNag1 peptides unambiguously matched internal peptides of GlcNAcases from V. angustum and Photobacterium sp, respectively. For VhNag2, 20 and 21 peptides
were identical with the internal peptides of V. parahaemolyticus and V. alginolyticus GlcNAcases (see additional file 1, Table S1). This peptide mass identification
strongly indicates that the proteins expressed in E. coli
are GlcNAcases.
Assessment of GlcNAcase activity and kinetic studies

Both of the purified GlcNAcases were active against
pNP-GlcNAc, but VhNag2 was found to be much more
active than VhNag1. We suspect that the full-length
VhNag1 is expressed as a pro-enzyme, which requires
proteolytic processing to attain its full activity. The
hydrolysis of pNP-GlcNAc by VhNag1 and VhNag2 was
determined as a function of time (additional file 2, Fig. S1).

VhNag2 activity was significantly greater than that of
VhNag1 over the entire course of reaction. In the reaction progress curves, the activity of both enzymes was
constant for up to 15 min, and then began to decrease
at longer incubation times. Therefore, the reaction
time was set to 10 min to ensure that initial velocities
were measured in subsequent kinetic experiments.
The effect of pH on GlcNAcase activity was examined
with pNP-GlcNAc as substrate. The pH activity profiles
of VhNag1 and VhNag2 were typical bell-shaped curves
as seen for most glycosyl hydrolases. Fig. 2B shows
enzymic activity decreasing at low and high pH values.
The maximal activity of VhNag1 was at pH 7.5 and of
VhNag2 at pH 7.0. When specific hydrolytic activity was
determined with various substrates (Fig. 3), pNPGlcNAc was found to be the most effective. While
VhNag2 could hydrolyze all the three pNP-glycosides

assayed at different pH values from 2.5 to 9.5 at 37°C for 10 min using pNP-GlcNAc as substrate

(although pNP-GlcNAc2 and pNP-Glucose were respectively hydrolyzed 300-fold and 700-fold less efficiently
than pNP-GlcNAc), VhNag1 was only active with pNPGlcNAc. Both enzymes could hydrolyze chitooligosaccharides (GlcNAc2-6) and colloidal chitin with VhNag2
being at least ten-times more active than VhNag1. Of
the natural glycosides, chitotetraose was the best substrate and chitotriose the second best. In contrast, chitobiose, chitopentaose and chitohexaose were only fair

substrates, and insoluble (colloidal) chitin was the poorest of all (Fig. 3).
The kinetic parameters of the hydrolytic activity of the
two GlcNAcases were further assessed. As shown in
Table 1, kcat/Km with pNP-GlcNAc was 11-fold greater
for VhNag2 than for VhNag1. It was noted throughout
this study that VhNag1 was tended to undergo rapid
and progressive loss of GlcNAcase activity. Although
several attempts were made to obtain the kinetic values
of this higher-M r enzyme, the data acquired with
VhNag1 could not be evaluated precisely, and we
decided not to present it in this study. In accordance

with our earlier demonstration (see Fig. 3), VhNag2 had
the lowest Km and highest kcat, yielding overall kcat/Km
of 4,935 M -1 s -1 towards pNP-GlcNAc. When natural
substrates were compared, VhNag2 had the greatest catalytic activity with GlcNAc4 (kcat/Km 304 M-1s-1 ), followed by GlcNAc3 (228 M-1s-1), GlcNAc5 (181 M-1s-1),
GlcNAc6 (166 M-1s-1), and GlcNAc2 (56 M-1s-1). Overall, k cat /K m of VhNag2 with pNP-GlcNAc is 88-fold
greater than with GlcNAc2 (the poorest glycoside substrate) and 16-fold greater than with GlcNAc4 (the best
glycoside substrate). In general, the glycosidic bond of
pNP-GlcNAc is more easily cleaved than that of
GlcNAc-GlcNAc, because of the higher electron-withdrawing capacity of p-nitrophenyl moiety. However, the
rate of hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl glycoside depends on
the affinity to the enzyme used. For example, Keyhani &
Roseman [27] showed that Vibrio furnssii b-GlcNAcidase (exoI) hydrolyzed pNP-GlcNAc about 5-fold faster
than GlcNAc 2 , but 1.4 fold slower than GlcNAc 3-6 ,
whereas Kubota et al. [28] reported that Streptomyces
thermoviolacacus NagC could hydrolyze pNP-GlcNAc
and GlcNAc 2 at equal rates. On the other hand, its
activity with the pNP substrate was between 2- to 3.5fold greater than with GlcNAc3-5.
Time course of chitin oligosaccharide hydrolysis by TLC
and HPLC

Degradation patterns of chitooligosaccharides by
VhNag2 were analyzed by TLC (Fig. 4). The most significant result obtained from TLC analysis is that VhNag2
acted exolytically, yielding GlcNAc as the end product
from all chitin oligomers. Additionally, GlcNAc 3 and
GlcNAc4 were degraded rapidly and almost completely
within 10 min (Fig. 4B and 4C), whilst the reaction of

Page 5 of 12

GlcNAc5 was not complete until 1 h of incubation (Fig.
4D). The degradation of GlcNAc 2 (Fig. 4A) and
GlcNAc6 (Fig. 4E) was even slower, complete hydrolysis
of these two substrates being attained only after 2 h of
incubation.
The time course of chitin oligosaccharide hydrolysis
by VhNag2 was further investigated by quantitative
HPLC. Fig. 5A shows GlcNAc 2 hydrolysis, showing a
rapid increase of the resultant product (GlcNAc) with
increasing reaction time. Fig. 5B and Fig. 5C show
GlcNAc 3 and GlcNAc4 hydrolysis. In agreement with
the TLC results, GlcNAc3 and GlcNAc4 were consumed
more rapidly than GlcNAc2 (Fig. 5A), GlcNAc5 (Fig. 5D)
and GlcNAc 6 (Fig. 5E). At the end of recording (180
min), no substrate was left from the digestion of
GlcNAc3 and GlcNAc4, whereas substantial amounts of
the other substrates remained. All substrates were
hydrolyzed exolytically, so that GlcNAcn was degraded
to GlcNAc n-1 + GlcNAc. The intermediate products,
such as GlcNAc n-1 and GlcNAc n-2 , were further
degraded to the final product GlcNAc. Fig. 5F shows
the overall rates of hydrolysis to be in the order:
GlcNAc4 ≅ GlcNAc3 > GlcNAc5 > GlcNAc6 > GlcNAc2.
The substrate-size dependence of the reaction rate can
be confirmed from the reaction time-course of extensive
hydrolysis of GlcNAc6 over a longer period of incubation (1,500 min (25 h), the upper right panel of Fig. 6);
that is, chitin pentamer and dimer accumulated during
the course of the reaction, whereas tetramer and trimer
were generated only transiently before being hydrolyzed
instantaneously by the enzyme. Of the natural glycosides, GlcNAc4 was found to be the best substrate for
VhNag2. Similar results were reported for b-GlcNAcidase (exoI) from Vibrio furnssii [27]. This enzyme

showed its highest V max towards GlcNAc 4 , while the
Vmax values decreased 1.1-fold with GlcNAc3 and 1.4fold with GlcNAc2. Further sequence analysis suggested
no putative signal peptide in the sequences of VhNAg1
and VhNag2. Therefore, the two enzymes are suggested
to be non-secretory proteins that act intracellularly. In
bacterial cells, the transport of chitin oligomers into the
intracellular compartments for further degradation by
these GlcNAcases could be achieved by specific membrane transporters. It has been proposed for V. furnissii
that the uptake of short-chain chitooligosaccharides,
such as GlcNAc3 and GlcNAc4, takes place through a
chitooligosaccharide-specific channel known as chitoporin [29,30].
Kinetic modeling and subsite mapping

Kinetic modeling of the enzymic reaction was carried
out based on the reaction scheme presented in Fig. 7.
To model the time-course of GlcNAc 6 hydrolysis
(shown in the upper panels of Fig. 6), numerical calculations were conducted using the differential equation
derived from the reaction scheme [31]. At first, the
binding free energy changes for the subsites from (-1) to

(+4) were estimated roughly by repeating the calculations with various values of the free energy changes.
Starting with initial guessed values, optimization of the
free energy changes conducted by the modified Powell
method [32] was employed using the cost function,
F=

∑ ∑ [(GlcNAc)c
i

n ,i

− (GlcNAc)e n,i ]2

(1)

n

where e and c represent the experimental and calculated values, respectively, n is the number of GlcNAc
units in the oligosaccharides, and i the reaction time.
The final iteration of the calculations yielded the
values of the rate constants for glycosidic bond cleavage
(k +1 ) for various chain lengths of GlcNAc n . The k cat
values obtained were allocated to k+1 for individual oligosaccharide substrates (Table 1). The individual k +1
values were fixed in the modeling calculation. Since no
evidence for transglycosylation was obtained from HPLC
determination of the enzymic products, this process was
not considered in the kinetic model. A much higher
value of 50 s-1 was tentatively allocated to the rate constant for hydration k +2 . Since VhNag2 splits off a

monosaccharide from the non-reducing end of the substrate, indicating that subsite (-2) should be the most
unfavorable for binding of the GlcNAc residue, we tentatively allocated a high positive value (+7.0 kcal/mol) to
the binding free energy change at subsite (-2). Using the
fixed values of k +1 , k +2 , and the binding free energy
change of subsite (-2), the values of binding free energies of individual subsites from (-1) to (+4) were optimized on the basis of the experimental time-course
(upper panels of Fig. 6). As shown in lower panels of
Fig. 6, the calculated time-courses were satisfactorily
fitted to the experimental ones, for both the early stage
(left panels) and the later stage (right panels) of the
reaction, yielding the binding free energy changes of the
individual subsites as listed in Table 2.
The TLC and kinetic data suggested that the catalytic
pocket of VhNag2 probably contains a sequence of four
favorable GlcNAc binding subsites, designated (-1)(+1)
(+2)(+3). Such an implication is certainly supported by
the binding free energy changes obtained by the kinetic
modeling. As shown in Table 2, a very high positive

value +7.0 kcal/mol for subsite (-2) suggests that there
is a large steric hindrance interfering with binding at
this subsite. A less positive value of +0.9 kcal/mol of
subsite (+4) suggests that the sugar residue binding to
this subsite is moderately unfavorable, but still possible.
Thus, GlcNAc4 binds to (-1) (+1), (+2), and (+3) more
strongly than GlcNAc5 to (-1) (+1), (+2), (+3) and (+4).
A low negative free energy change, -0.1 kcal/mol, was
estimated for binding at subsite (+3). This is consistent
with the fact that the GlcNAc 3 binding affinity to the
subsites (-1) (+1), and (+2) (Km = 441 μM) is somewhat
weaker than that of the GlcNAc4 binding to (-1) (+1),
(+2), and (+3) (K m = 329 μM). All of these results
clearly indicate that an array of four GlcNAc binding
subsites (-1)(+1)(+2)(+3) define the substrate affinity of
VhNag2. It appears that the GlcNAcases reported to
date possess two major types of substrate specificity.
The first type has marked preference towards chitobiose,
while the other type favours chitooligomers (GlcNAc3-6)
over chitodimer. Examples of the former type are
hyperthermophilic kodakaraensis KOD1 GlmATK [33],

strictly prohibited. The simultaneous differential equations were derived from the reaction model, and numerically solved to obtain the
calculated time-course. The details of the calculation method are described in ref. [31].

SmChb [25], and S. thermoviolacacus NagC [28]. On the
other hand, V. furnissii exoI [27], human di-N-acetylchitobiase [34], and VhNag2 (in this report) are among the
other type. The active site of the second type of GlcNAcases has been demonstrated to contain three to five
GlcNAc binding subsites, depending on the substrate
specificity of individual enzymes. Multiple sugar-binding-site architecture is not uncommon, as has been
demonstrated for other exo-glycosidases such as

Aspergillus niger cellobiase [35], a GH-3 enzyme that
degrades cellobioase and cello-oligosaccharides into glucose units. The catalytic center of this enzyme has been
reported to contain up to five binding subsites. Also,
structural studies of the active site of Bacillus halodurans C-125 REX [36], a GH-8 exo-oligoxylanase that
hydrolyzes xylooligosaccharides to xylose from the reducing end, revealed three substrate binding subsites.

Conclusions
This study reports the isolation, cloning and recombinant expression of the genes encoding two intracellular
GH-20 GlcNAcases from a marine bacterium, Vibrio
harveyi type strain 650. Data obtained from TLC and
quantitative HPLC suggested that the active GlcNAcase
homolog (VhNag2) was an exolytic enzyme that
degraded chitin oliogmers, releasing GlcNAc as the end
product. Kinetic modeling suggested that the active site

Suginta et al. BMC Biochemistry 2010, 11:40
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/11/40

of VhNag2 comprises four GlcNAc binding subsites,
(-1), (+1), (+2), (+3). Such subsite identification is
strongly supported by kinetic data, which showed chitin
tetramer as the most effective substrate for this enzyme.

Methods
Bacterial strains and vectors

V. harveyi type strain 650 was a marine isolate from
Greek sea bass and was a gift from Professor Brian Austin, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, United Kingdom. E. coli strain DH5a was used for routine cloning
and plasmid preparations. pGEM®-T easy vector used
for subcloning purpose was a product of Promega (Promega Pte Ltd, Singapore Science Park I, Singapore). The
pQE 60 expression vector and E. coli type strain M15
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) were used for cloning and
a high-level expression of recombinant GlcNAcases.
Cloning of the DNAs encoding VhNag1 and VhNag2

Three sets of oligonucleotide primers were designed
based on the three putative GlcNAce genes, designated
VIBHAR_01265, VIBHAR_03430, VIBHAR_06345) from
V. harveyi type strain ATCC BAA-1116 in the CAZy
database. However, only two PCR products, namely
VhNag1 and VhNag2, were successfully amplified from
the genomic DNA of V. harveyi type strain 650. The oligonucleotides used for amplification of VhNag1 DNA
are 5’-AGGATCCGGGCAGGGTAAAATC-3’ for the
forward primer and 5’-AGGAGATCTATCGGTTAAAGTGTGAAG-3’ for the reverse primer. For
VhNag2 DNA, 5’-AGGGATCCGAATACCGTGTTGATTTA-3’ was used as the forward primer and 5’AATAGATCTCTTCCACGGTTTACGGTA-3’ for the
reverse primer. The PCR products of expected sizes (2.3
kbp for VhNag1 and 1.9 kbp for VhNag2) were cloned
in the pQE60 expression vector using BamH I and Bgl
II cloning sites (sequences underlined) following the
protocol supplied by the manufacturer.
Nucleotide, amino acid sequence and phylogenic
analyzes

The nucleotide sequences of VhNAg1 and VhNag2 were
determined by automated double stranded DNA sequencing (Bio Service Unit, Thailand Science Park, Bangkok,
Thailand). Ambiguous nucleotides were re-confirmed
twice before submission to the Genbank database. The
amino acid sequence alignment was constructed using
“CLUSTALW’’ algorithm commercially available in
Lasergene v.7 (DNASTAR, Inc., WI, USA) and displayed
using the Genedoc program (http://www.psc.edu/
biomed/genedoc/). The putative sequences of VhNag1
and VhNag2 were aligned with the previously published
V. harveyi chitobiase [26] together with four bacterial
and two human GlcNAcases of known structures.

Protein expression and purification

The full-length VhNag1 and VhNag2 DNAs were cloned
into pQE60 expression vector and expressed in E. coli
M15 host as the C-terminally (His)6 -tagged polypeptides. The cells were grown at 37°C in Luria Bertani
(LB) medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin until the
OD 600 of the cell culture reached 0.6. Expression was
induced by the addition of isopropyl thio-b-D-galactoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. After 18
h of induction at 20°C, the cell pellet was collected by
centrifugation, re-suspended in lysis buffer (20 mM
Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl, 1
mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1.0
μg/ml lysozyme), and then lysed on ice using a Sonopuls
Ultrasonichomogenizer with a 6-mm-diameter probe
(50% duty cycle; amplitude setting, 20%; total time, 30 s,
6-8 times). Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g, 20 min at 4οC. The supernatant was
immediately applied to a Ni-NTA agarose affinity column (1 × 10 cm) (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany),
and the chromatography was carried out under gravity
at 4°C. The column was washed thoroughly with 5 mM
imidazole, followed by 20 mM imidazole in equilibration
buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0), and then 250
mM imidazole in the same buffer. Three eluted fractions
(10 ml each) were collected and analyzed by 12% SDSPAGE [37] to confirm purity. GlcNAcase fractions were
pooled and then subjected to several rounds of membrane centrifugation using Vivaspin-20 ultrafiltration
membrane concentrators (Mr 10,000 cut-off, Vivascience
AG, Hannover, Germany) for complete removal of imidazole. The final concentration of the protein was determined by Bradford’s method [38].
Confirmation of recombinant expression by mass
spectrometry

The purified VhNag1 and VhNag2 (2 μg) were applied
in parallel onto a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, and stained with
Coomassie blue R-250 after electrophoresis. After
destaining, protein bands were subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega) using a
standard protocol [39]. The resultant peptides were analyzed by high resolution nanoESI/FTMS by the mass
spectrometry facility located at the Max-Planck Institute
for Molecular Physiology, Dortmund. Data bank searching was performed with “Mascot search” (http://www.
matrixscience.com/) for peptide mass fingerprinting.
GlcNAcase activity assays

GlcNAcase activity was determined spectrophotometrically using pNP-GlcNAc (Sigma-Aldrich Pte Ltd., The
Capricorn, Singapore Science Park II, Singapore) as substrate or by a reducing sugar assay using GlcNAc 2-6
(AMS Biotechnology (Europe) Ltd, Oxfordshire, UK)

Suginta et al. BMC Biochemistry 2010, 11:40
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/11/40

and colloidal chitin as substrates. For the pNP assay, a
100-μl assay mixture contained the protein sample (50
μg), 125 μM pNP-GlcNAc), and 0.065 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 The enzymic reaction was continued for 10
min at 37°C before being terminated by the addition of
100 μl 3 M Na 2 CO 3 . The amount of p-nitrophenol
(pNP) released was determined spectrophotometrically
at 405 nm in a microtiter plate reader (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Molar concentrations of
pNP were calculated from a calibration curve constructed with 0-20 nmol pNP. For the reducing sugar
assay, the reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 250 μM
GlcNAc2-6 in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 and 200
μg enzyme or 500 μM pNP-glycoside in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 and 100 μg enzyme. The reaction
mixture was incubated at 37°C for 15 min in a Thermomixer comfort (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany),
then heated at 100°C for 10 min. The entire reaction
mixture was subjected to 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS)
assay following the protocol described by Miller [40].
Release of the reducing sugars was detected spectrophotometrically at 540 nm and molar concentrations of the
released sugars were estimated using a standard calibration curve of GlcNAc (0-500 nmol). For colloidal chitin,
the reaction mixture (200 μl), containing 5% (w/v) colloidal chitin (prepared according to Hsu and Lockwood,
1975 [41]), 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 200 μg
enzyme, was incubated at 37°C for 15 min. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 1 min to precipitate the
remaining chitin, the product concentration in the
supernatant (100 μl) was determined by DNS method as
described for GlcNAc2-6.
Effects of pH on the enzymatic activity

A discontinuous assay was used to determine the pH
profiles of VhNag1 and VhNag2. The reaction mixtures
containing 500 μM pNP-GlcNAc were pre-incubated at
37°C for 5 min at different pH values ranging from 2.5
to 9.0 using the McIlvaine’s sodium phosphate-citric
acid - KCl buffer system [42], followed by addition of 1
μg VhNag1 or 0.5 μg VhNag2. After 10 min of incubation, the reactions were terminated with 100 μl of 3 M
Na2CO3. The amounts of pNP released were estimated
as described for the pNP assay.
Time course of substrate analysis by thin-layer
chromatography

Hydrolysis of chitooligosaccharides (GlcNAc 2-6 ) by
VhNag2 was carried out in a 20-μl reaction mixture,
containing 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 2.5 mM substrate and 5 μg purified enzyme. The reaction mixture
was incubated at 30°C for 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 min, 3 h or 18
h, and the reaction terminated by boiling for 5 min. For
product analysis, five 1-μl aliquots of each reaction

Page 10 of 12

mixture were applied to a silica TLC plate (7 × 10 cm),
and then chromatographed three times (1 h each) in a
mobile phase containing n-butanol:methanol:28%
ammonia solution:H 2 O (10:8:4:2) (v/v), followed by
spraying with aniline-diphenylamine reagent and baking
at 180°C for 3 min. To determine the time course of
chitin hydrolysis, the reaction was carried out in a 150μl reaction mixture, containing 0.1 M phosphate buffer,
pH 7.0, 20 mg colloidal chitin, and 50 μg purified
enzyme. Subsequent reactions and determination of the
reaction products were analyzed by TLC as described
for chitooligosaccharide hydrolysis.
Time-course analysis of chitooligosaccharide hydrolysis
by HPLC

A reaction mixture (100 μl) containing 1.25 mM chitin
oligosaccharide (GlcNAc2-6), 38 μM VhNag2 and 0.2 M
sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 was incubated at 30°C.
An aliquot of 12 μl was transferred to a new microfuge
tube containing 12 μl 0.1 M NaOH after 5, 10, 15, 30, 60,
120 and 180 min, and the enzymic reaction was stopped
by snap-freezing in liquid N2 and the mixture immediately stored at -20°C. To quantitatively determine the
time-course of substrate degradation and product formation, 15-μl of the reaction mixture was applied to a gelfiltration column of TSK-GEL G2000PW (7.5 × 600 mm,
Tosoh) connected with a Hitachi L-7000 HPLC system
(Hitachi Koki Co., Ltd, Tokyo). Elution was conducted
with distilled water at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min, and the
substrate and products were monitored by their absorption at 220 nm. Based on the peak areas obtained from
the elution profiles, oligosaccharide concentrations were
calculated using a standard curve obtained with authentic
saccharide solutions, and then plotted against the reaction time to obtain the reaction time-course.
Steady-state kinetics

Kinetic parameters were determined using pNP-GlcNAc
and chitooligosaccharides (GlcNAc2-6) by the reducing
sugar assay as described above, with 0-500 μM of each
substrate in the reaction mixture. The amounts of the
reaction products were determined from a standard
curve of GlcNAc (0-1.75 μmol). Kinetic parameter
values were evaluated from three independent sets of
data using the nonlinear regression function obtained
from the GraphPad Prism v.5.0 (GraphPad Software
Inc., San Diego, CA).
Kinetic modeling of substrate hydrolysis

Kinetic modeling of the reaction time-course obtained by
HPLC was carried out using the reaction model reported
for the Coccidioides immitis family 18 chitinase [43]. The
model scheme is shown in Fig. 7. Considering that the
enzyme hydrolyzes the oligosaccharide substrate

Suginta et al. BMC Biochemistry 2010, 11:40
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/11/40

exolytically from the non-reducing end, VhNag2 was
assumed to have a (-2)(-1)(+1)(+2)(+3)(+4)-type binding
cleft, where subsite (-2) should have an unfavorable
(positive) binding free energy change. By assuming rapid
binding equilibrium, the concentrations of the ES-complexes formed through the individual binding modes (Cn,
i, Bi,j, and Ai) were calculated from the binding constants,
which were obtained from the binding free energy values
of individual subsites occupied with the sugar residues
assuming additivity. Details of the calculation method
were described by Honda and Fukamizo [31].
