Abstract
Background: The fibrinogen-like (FBG) domain, which consists of approximately 200 amino acid
residues, has high sequence similarity to the C-terminal halves of fibrinogen β and γ chains.
Fibrinogen-related proteins (FREPs), which contain FBG domains in their C-terminal region, are
found universally in vertebrates and invertebrates. In invertebrates, FREPs are involved in immune
responses and other aspects of physiology. To understand the complexity of this family in insects,
we analyzed FREPs in the mosquito genome and made comparisons to FREPs in the fruitfly genome.
Results: By using the genome data of the mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, 53 FREPs were identified,
whereas only 20 members were found in the Drosophila melanogaster genome. Using sequence
profile analysis, we found that FBG domains have high sequence similarity and are highly conserved
throughout the FBG domain region. By secondary structure analysis and comparison, the FBG
domains of FREPs are predicted to function in recognition of carbohydrates and their derivatives
on the surface of microorganisms in innate immunity.
Conclusion: Detailed sequence and structural analysis discloses that the FREP family contains FBG
domains that have high sequence similarity in the A. gambiae genome. Expansion of the FREP family
in mosquitoes during evolutionary history is mainly accounted for by a major expansion of the FBG
domain architecture. The characterization of the FBG domains in the FREP family is likely to aid in
the experimental analysis of the ability of mosquitoes to recognize parasites in innate immunity and
physiologies associated with blood feeding.

Background
In mammals, fibrinogen, a soluble plasma protein, contains six polypeptide chains, two each of the Aα, Bβ and γ
chains, linked by 29 disulfide bonds. Fibrinogen participates in both the cellular phase and the fluid phase of
coagulation [1]. The fibrinogen-like (FBG) domain,

which consists of approximately 200aa residues and has
high similarity to the C-terminal halves of fibrinogen β
and γ chains, has been found in a growing number of proteins [2]. Three distinct fibrinogen-related proteins
(FREPs) have been identified in human: ficolin, tenascins,
and microfibril-associated protein (MAP) [3-5]. These

FREPs all contain a common C-terminal FBG domain
with high sequence identity to the C-terminal regions of
fibrinogen β and γ chains, but differ in their N-terminal
regions. The FBG domain in ficolin can be brought
together as clusters of three by collagen O-like triple helices, and is responsible for N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)
binding activity [6]. Recent studies have shown that
human serum ficolins act as phagocytic receptors on circulating monocytes for microorganism recognition [7].
Tenascins are a family of multifunctional extracellular
matrix (ECM) glycoproteins subject to complex spatial
and temporal patterns of expression in the course of various organogenetic processes. These proteins mediate cell
adhesion and show tissue-specific and cell growth-associated expression [4]. Microfibril-associated protein,
another extracellular matrix protein, is a component of
connective tissue microfibrils and a candidate for involvement in the etiology of inherited connective tissue diseases, which are associated with the Smith-magenis
syndrome, a multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation syndrome [8].
In invertebrates, several FREPs have been reported in various species, such as tachylectins from the horseshoe crab,
Tachypleus tridentatus [9], fibrinogen-related proteins
(FREP) from the snail, Biomphalaria glabrata [10], ficolins
from the solitary ascidian, Halocynthia roretzi [11], tachylectin-related protein in the sponge, Suerites domuncula
[12] and aslectin (AL-1) from the mosquito, Armigeres subalbatus [13]. All of these FREPs contain a common C-terminal FBG domain with high sequence identity to that of
fibrinogen β and γ chains, but which differs in their N-terminal regions. These FREPs likely play an important role
in the innate immune response against parasites
[9,12,13]. The FBG domain of tachylectin is able to bind
GlcNAc [9]. Aslectin, which also binds GlcNAc, is able to
bind bacteria, and is likely involved in the antibacterial
immune response in mosquitoes [13].
The rapid progress in the development of whole genome
and expressed sequence tag (EST) databases provides an
abundance of sequence data that greatly facilitates gene
function studies. Using bioinformatics, one can mine the
information from these databases to acquire an overview
of each gene family and assess evolutionary relationships
among its members [14]. Although the FREP family in the
genomes of Anopheles gambiae and Drosophila melanogaster
was briefly compared earlier [15], the FBG domains in this
gene family have not been comparatively characterized. In
this study, data derived from the genome and EST databases of the mosquito, A. gambiae, and the fruitfly, D. melanogaster, are presented here as an initial, yet exhaustive
search for FREPs in both species. Provided is an overview
of this protein family, including sequence alignments,
patterns of conservation, and phylogenetic relationships.

A further comparison between the annotated gene products from the genome sequences and the actual transcripts
from the EST database also is made. In summary, these
studies provide the first encompassing description of the
FREP gene family in insects and establish a foundation for
future studies that aim to define the role of these genes.

Results and discussion
Identification of FREP genes and characterization of the
FBG domain in the A. gambiae genome
To identify FREP proteins encoded in the A. gambiae
genome, a PSI-BLAST search was performed using AL-1 as
a query sequence to screen the A. gambiae genome database at NCBI. Sixty amino acids were used as the minimum length of homology, and protein sequences having
35% or greater amino acid identity with AL-1 were added
to the gene family list. To find FREPs that may have been
overlooked due to low sequence identity to AL-1, we
selected each sequence from the search results as a new
seed to search the A. gambiae genome database again.
Additional sequences were identified as homologs of the
queries and added to the original list. This gene family list
was manually examined to eliminate redundant
sequences generated by repeated searching. This search
revealed the presence of 53 genes encoding hypothetical
FREP proteins in the A. gambiae genome (Table 1).

To define the FBG domain in the FREP family, all 53 FREP
and the human fibrinogen chain γ were aligned with the
T_Coffee program. The results showed that most of the
FREP genes have a C-terminal region composed of
approximately 200aa with high sequence similarity with
the C-terminus of human fibrinogen chain γ. Based on the
alignment, the highly conserved region of 200aa residues
in FREP was defined as the FBG domain in this study. A
selected number of the FBG domains of the FREP were
aligned and the highly conserved regions are illustrated in
Fig. 1. This definition also is supported by the FBG
domains in human and mouse ficolins [2]. In the FREP
gene family, 28 of the 53 FREP genes were found in complete open reading frames and with a full FBG domain,
and the remaining 25 FREP genes have truncated FBG
domains, either in the 5'-region or the 3'-region (Table 1).
Using a signal peptide prediction program, 14 of the 53
FREPs were predicted to contain secretion signal peptides
(Table 1), suggesting that FREPs can be extracellular or
intracellular.
Conserved structure of the FBG domain in the FREP family
and variation in some members
To construct an optimal multiple alignment of the FBG
domain, we first aligned selected sequences with the
T_Coffee program; this was followed by refinements on
the basis of the PSI-BLAST search results. The selected
multiple sequence alignment is shown in Fig. 1. The mul-

1. P represents precursor form of the predicted protein. M represents mature form of the predicted protein. Blank in column M indicates that
signal is unpredictable.
2. FBG domain classified three categories. Full is the protein containing entire FBG domain; 5' truncated is the protein containing part of FBG
domain which is truncated at the 5 primer region; 3' truncated is the protein containing part of FBG domain which is truncated at the 3 primer
region.
3. In the transcription, + indicates matched transcript in EST database, – indicates no matched transcript in EST database. Tissue distribution was
represented with the short-written of the EST library that was described in table 2.

tiple alignment of the FBG domain sequences shows that
FBG domains are highly similar throughout. Strikingly,
53% (28/53) of the FREPs contained a full FBG domain in
their C-terminus (Table 1). Interestingly, some of the
FREPs contain more than one FBG domain, although
most of them are all not full FBG domains (Fig. 1). The
distribution of the multiple FBG domains in these proteins shows certain patterns. Some of them contain two
FBG domains that are connected by a 150aa hinge, e.g.,
EAA10360 and EAA05204. However, the two FBG
domains in EAA10466 are located in the center of the protein, and are hinged together by approximately 20aa residues. There are also some members that contain 3 FBG
domains. In EAA05042, three equivalent length regions of
the FBG domain were repeated in the sequence (Fig. 2).
Some of the FREPs also are composed of other domains in
addition to the FBG domain, such as Lipase in EAA10466
(Fig. 2). In invertebrates, several FREP proteins have been
reported to play an important role in innate immunity
and in particular in the recognition of parasites (TL5A, AL1). AL-1 can be upregulated by bacterial challenge and is
able to bind GlcNAc and bacteria [13]. The FBG domain
of TL5A can form a ligand-binding pocket specifically recognizing the acetyl-group in eliciting an immune
response [16]. These data suggest that the FBG domains of
FREPs probably function in recognizing carbohydrate
moieties as part of the role they play in the mosquito
immune response.

Using the multiple alignment of the FBG domains as queries, the secondary structure was predicted with the PHD
program. The results show that the FBG domains have a
highly conserved structure profile throughout the FBG
domain (Fig. 1). By comparison of the predicted secondary structure with multiple alignment, most of these secondary structures fall in the conserved region, suggesting
that FBG domains have similar domain architectures in
the FREP gene family. To further compare the predicted
secondary structure of the FBG domains with known
structures, we found that the FBG domain is structurally
related to the human fibrinogen γ fragment and the FBG
domain of TL5A in the protein data bank (PDB) (Fig. 3A
and 3B) [16,17]. The FBG domains of human fibrinogen
γ fragment and TL5A compose the central and larger
domain B and a relatively smaller domain P (Fig. 4). The
domain B is predominantly built up by a twisted sevenstranded antiparallel β-sheet (strands β3-β7, β9 and β12)
and helices α4 and α5 (Fig. 3A), and their tertiary structure is very similar (Fig. 3B). The domain P possesses only
a few short elements of secondary structure, and comprises the major functional site forming a binding pocket
[16]. The predicted secondary structures of the FBG
domains in the FREP gene family approximately correspond to the domain architectures of FBG domains in
human fibrinogen γ chain and TL5A. The β-sheets and αhelices in the predicted structure of the FBG domain are
highly conserved with the corresponding structures in

TL5A, especially in the domain B (Fig. 1 and Fig. 3B). For
example, the central strand β12, which extends the C terminus of domain P back to domain B and brings both
polypeptide termini in close proximity, was also seen in
the FBG domains (Fig. 1 and Fig. 4). This suggests that the
FBG domain architecture is conserved between houseshoe
crab and mosquitoes. The projection of some of the
highly conserved domains that form the ligand-binding
pocket suggests that the core structure of the ligand-binding pocket is also likely to be conserved across these FBG
domains (Fig. 1, Fig. 3B and Fig. 4). These observations
imply that the FBG domains are most likely to function as
receptors for carbohydrates or their derivatives. Beyond
the common core, FBG domains also show great diversity
in terms of the insertions and deletions among the conserved domains. Some FBG domains lose a conserved
domain due to deletion, such as EAL39350. Other members have a short insertion located in the loop region, such
as EAA10406 and EAA15009 (Fig. 1). By comparison of
amino acids in the FBG domains of FREP corresponding
to the P domain binding site in TL5A, we found that the
domain architectures of these FBG domains have considerable diversity that is incorporated into a shared basic
architectural blueprint (Fig. 1).
In domain P of TL5A, a disulfide bridge Cys-206-Cys-219
is an important structure to connect the metal-binding site

to the acetyl group recognition site. These two conserved
cysteines were seen in the FBG domains of the FREP family (Fig. 1). Furthermore, four aromatic side chains (Tyr210, Tyr-236, Tyr-248, and His-220), which can form a
funnel to the acetyl-group in TL5A, were also seen in most
of the FBG domains of FREPs (Fig. 1). In some of the FBG
domains, the amino acids corresponding to the binding
sites have mutated. This great diversity probably provides
the variability necessary for these FBG domains to form
slightly different binding sites that could recognize different carbohydrates. This provides a diverse and potential
flexible arsenal for the host to recognize a variety of correspondingly diverse carbohydrates on the surface of pathogens. Alternatively, it is likely that some of the FBG
domains have other unknown functions besides recognition. Beyond the conservation of the full FBG domains in
the FREP gene family, FBG domains show great variety in
terms of their lengths. Multiple sequence alignment
shows that 24 of the 53 FREPs consist of truncated FBG
domains (data not shown). Multiple sequence alignment
shows that 24 of the 53 FREPs consist of truncated FBG
domains (Table 1). The lengths vary from 30 to 160
amino acids. Many of them are truncated in the C-terminus. By scanning the corresponding genome sequences
using Artemis, we found some of the truncated parts of the
FBG domain exist in the genome in close relation to the
annotated fragment, suggesting that the truncation prob-

ably was a missannotation of the genome. By comparison
of sequence similarity and structural profile, the recognition sites in the FBG domains of FREP and TL5A correspond structurally to the polymerization pocket in the
fibrinogen γ fragment (Fig. 3A and 3B). Five of the seven
amino acids that form the polymerization pocket are
structurally equivalent to amino acids in the sugar-binding site of TL5A. The long loops P-1 and P-3 in the fibrinogen γ fragment are shortened by 14 and 7 amino acids
respectively in the FBG domains and TL5A, and represent
the major structural differences found in the functionally
important domain P. The domain P also has very different
surface charge in the two structures. On 1FIB, it forms a
highly negative charged patch (Fig. 5A), while it is mainly
hydrophobic on 1JC9 (Fig. 5B), which probably contributed to their target specificities. Variability in this domain
points to a potential evolutionary transition from a carbohydrate to a protein-binding module [16,17].
Phylogenetic relationships of the FBG domains in A.
gambiae
To understand the evolutionary history of this gene family, an attempt was made to identify correlations between
chromosomal locations of FREP and FBG domain
sequence similarities among the family members. The

genes for the FREP family in A. gambiae have been
mapped to specific A. gambiae chromosomal locations by
retrieving Locuslink from Ensembl. Of the 53 FREP genes,
chromosomal locations could be determined for (Fig. 6).
The majority of FREP genes are found in clusters on chromosomes 2L and 3L, and some of these genes are arrayed
in tandem. Twenty three genes located on chromosome
3L form 2 large clusters and 10 genes located on the chromosome 2L form two small clusters. This suggests that the
FREP gene family evolved by expansion. FBG domains
tandemly linked present a target for mispairing and unequal crossover, which could have resulted in duplication
and divergence of the genes over time. These tandemly
duplicated FBG domains could then become physically
separated through chromosomal rearrangements and
translocation. This suggests a dynamic history for the FBG
domains that is likely to have involved gene expansion,
with the FREP gene family evolving through vast expansion of the FBG domain.

ary tree of the FBG domains. This branch is comprised
largely of FBG domains of the FREP family from the A.
gambiae genome. If the number of FBG domains increased
mainly by tandem duplication, we would expect the
domains which are physically clustered in the genome to
form a monophyletic group. However, by examinating
the relationships between phyletic pattern and chromosomal location of the FBG domains, it is found that some
FBG domains grouped together in the phylogenetic tree
are located on different chromosomes, such as EAA09906
and EAA04072, EAA43404 and EAA13725 (Fig. 6 and Fig.
7). This suggests that a dynamic history for the FBG
domains likely involved shuffling among chromosomes.
The predicted role, for at least a subset of these FBG
domains, is in carbohydrate sensing. This expansion in
the A. gambiae genome may have been a response to the
diversity of carbohydrates encountered, resulting in the
utilization of numerous FBG domain variations in order
to recognize a broad range of different carbohydrates.

To analyze the evolutionary history of FBG domains in the
FREP family, a phylogenetic tree was constructed with the
alignments of the conserved FBG domains using maximum-likelihood methods (Fig. 7). This tree showed that
the FBG domains were grouped into several branches.
However, a major branch was observed in the evolution-

ESTs for FREPs in mosquitoes
To confirm that the conceptual FREP proteins predicted
from the genome are actually transcribed in mosquitoes,
we searched the A. anopheles EST database. Twenty one of
the 53 predicted genes were identified to have transcripts
(Table 1). Examination of the transcript resources reveals

that these genes are likely to be expressed in different tissues in mosquitoes, such as fat body, midgut and head
(Table 1 and 2). Some of these genes also are expressed
following immune challenges and a blood meal. These
results suggest that FREP genes probably play a role in
immune responses or any of the diverse array of physiologies associated with blood feeding. However, more than
50% of the predicted FREP genes have not been identified
transcriptionally in the EST database. It is possible that the
EST database does not cover the entire transcriptome and
greater coverage is needed. To compare the actual transcripts of the FREP genes in different mosquito species,
the FREP transcripts in Ar. subalbatus and Aedes aegypti
were searched in the immune challenged hemocyte EST
databases at ASAP [18]. Five and 12 different genes were
transcribed respectively in the bacteria-challenged

hemocytes. This suggests that some of the FREP genes are
hemocyte-associated and possibly involved in innate
immune responses post bacteria inoculation [19].
Fibrinogen-related proteins in D. melanogaster
D. melanogaster is an important experimental insect and is
used as a standard research model in the biomedical sciences. D. melanogaster is closely related to mosquitoes,
with both insects belonging to the order Diptera. To compare the evolutionary development of the FBG domains
between mosquito and fruitfly, detailed analyses of conserved segments were conducted. By searching the NCBI
database, 20 FREP conceptual proteins were predicted in
the D. melanogaster genome (Table 1). The multiple alignment of the FBG domain sequences showed that conservation exists throughout the FBG domain region (Fig. 8).

Phylogenetic tree of the FBG domains of the FREP family in A. gambiae
Phylogenetic tree of the FBG domains of the FREP family in A. gambiae. Phylogenetic relationships of the FBG
domains are shown. The seed alignment used for constructing the tree was the multiple alignment sequences shown in Fig. 1.
Maximum-likelihood approach was used to construct the tree with the proml program of the PHYLIP package, which uses the
Jones-Taylor-Thornton model of change between amino acids and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) method of inferring different rates of evolution at different amino acid positions. The FBG domains of each FREP are denoted by their gene name in
GenBank.

Truncated FBG domains also exist in FREPs in D. melanogaster (Table 1). For example, two members of the FREP
gene family have 3'-truncated FBG domains (AAF44911
and AAL48972). To further understand the relationships
of the FBG domains between A. gambiae and D. melanogaster, a phylogenetic tree was constructed by using the
conserved FBG domains from both species. The most
striking pattern observed in the evolutionary tree was the
presence of multiple branches comprised largely of proteins from a single organism (Fig. 10). These lineage spe-

cific expansions accounted for most of the FBG domains
in A. gambiae and D. melanogaster. Furthermore, a branch
comprised of the FBG domains from both A. gambiae and
D. melanogaster was also noted (EAA01294, EEA15009,
AAF55227, AAA28880) (Fig. 10).
To determine genomic distribution of FREP members, the
chromosomal location for every sequence was found by
using the Locuslink program. Position information
showed that some genes have more than one transcript

(Fig. 9). To get the detailed information about these
genes, a comparison of mRNA and genome sequences was
performed by using the Spidey program at NCBI. The
results showed that the predicted proteins from the same
genes are generated by alternative splicing among exons
and introns post transcription. Some of the FBG domains
come from the same transcription region, such as
AAF46535 and AAM52597. This would generate the same
FBG domains. However, some of the FBG domains are
generated from different regions. For example, transcription of the FBG domain in AAN09447 is located in a big
intron between the first two exons in AAF48780, resulting
in different FBG domains. To determine the actual fully
processed transcripts of these genes, a search of the EST
database was conducted. Thirteen of the 20 FREP proteins
were identified in the D. melanogaster transcript database.
By examining the genomic location, we found that
AAF49079, AAN11645 and AAM11109 are transcribed
from the same gene. The actual transcripts of these 3 gene
products are also represented in the EST database. This
further illustrates the complexity of gene regulation post
transcription, which could provide multiple protein products from a single gene, thereby, further increasing variation in the FREP family.
Compared with the D. melanogaster FREP gene family, the
massive expansion of the FREP gene family in mosquitoes
probably is associated with particular aspects of the mosquito's biology, possibly hematophagy and exposure to
parasites [15]. The blood meal imposes challenges associated with proliferation of the microbial flora in the gut
and coagulation of ingested blood and penetration of the

midgut by blood-born pathogens. A FREP protein (e.g AL1) in the mosquito Ar. subalbatus has bacteria binding
properties, and it has been suggested that FREP may be
important in controlling bacteria infections in
mosquitoes [13]. However, mosquitoes may use a
number of FREP proteins as anticoagulants, for instance,
as competitive inhibitors preventing polymerization of
blood [15]. Some mosquito FREP genes are up-regulated
by invading malaria parasites [20,21], suggesting a possible role in an antimalarial defense system.

Conclusion
The detailed sequence and structural analyses disclose
that the FREP family contains highly similar FBG domains
in the A. gambiae genome. FBG domains are predicted to
recognize carbohydrates and their derivatives. The
sequence divergence seen in the binding domains of FBG
domains makes it possible to recognize a wide range of
carbohydrate derivatives. This suggests that the FREP family may play an important role in innate immunity.
Expansion of the family during evolutionary history is
mainly accounted for by a major expansion of the FBG
domain architectures. Further analysis of the
chromosomal locations and phyletic patterns of the FBG
domains suggest that they have been acquired by tandem
duplication and shuffling. Compared with D.
melanogaster, the massive expansion of the FREP family in
A. gambiae probably is associated with particular aspects
of the mosquito's biology, such as exposure to parasites
and hematophagy. Experimental investigations of these
proteins are likely to be of interest in understanding insect
innate immunity and physiology.

Figure sequence alignment of a representative set of the FBG domains of FREP in D. melanogaster
Multiple8
Multiple sequence alignment of a representative set of the FBG domains of FREP in D. melanogaster. Multiple
sequence alignment was constructed using T-Coffee program. The 100% consensus sequence was boxed with black in the
alignment. The PHD secondary structure is shown above the alignment with H representing an α-helix and E representing a βstrand. The sequences are denoted by their gene name in GenBank.

Methods
Database searching and sequence retrieving for fibrinogen-related
protein
A PSI-BLAST search [22] of the A. gambiae and D. melanogaster genome database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [23] was performed
using AL-1 as a query. To obtain the recent progress of
FREP in A. gambiae genome, the A. gambiae database at
Ensembl [24] was also searched. Following accumulation
of the complete list of accession numbers, the correspond-

ing protein sequence was retrieved from GenBank at NCBI
and Ensembl.
Signal peptide prediction
Signal peptides were predicted using the SignalPv3.0
[25,26].
Searching for ESTs database
To determine the actual transcripts for individual FREP
genes, BLAST search of an EST database at Berkeley Dro-

sophila Genome Project and TIGR A. gambiae Gene Index
(AgGI) was performed [27,28]. The annotated cDNA
sequences encoding FREPs identified in the PSI-BLAST
search were used as queries for individual BLAST search in
these EST database. The availability of EST was
determined based on sequence similarity with the query:
a 97% or greater identity was considered to be an EST
corresponding to a specific gene. To get information
about FREP transcripts in the mosquito, Ar. Subalbatus
and Ae. aegypti, hemocyte EST databases at ASAP in both
species were searched using AL-1 as a seed [18,29].
Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
Multiple sequence alignment was performed using the TCoffee program [30,31]. Phylogenetic analysis was carried
out with the maximum-likelihood algorithm [32]. The
package used for phylogenetic analysis was proml program from PHYLIP [33], and the unrooted tree was draw
using drawtree program in this package.

View of DNA sequence annotation
To verify the annotation of truncated genes, the corresponding genomic sequences was scanned by Artemis
[34].
Secondary structure prediction
Secondary structure prediction was produced with the
PHD program [35], with multiple alignment of individual
FBG domains of FREP family. The structure data of TL5A
and recombinant human γ-fibrinogen carboxyl terminal
fragment were obtained from protein data bank (PBD)
[36] and the ribbon diagrams were constructed with Molmol program [37].
Chromosomal location and alternative splice transcripts
The chromosomal location of the FREP genes in A. gambiae genome was retrieved at Ensembl [24]. The chromosomal location of the FREP genes in D. melanogaster was
retrieved at NCBI [23]. To identify alternative spliced transcripts for each gene, spidey, a cDNA-to-genomic

Phylogenitic tree of the FBG domains from A. gambiae and D. melanogaster. The seed alignment used for constructing the tree was the multiple alignment sequences of representative set of the FBG domains of FREP families in A. gambiae and
D. melanogaster. The phylogenetic tree was constructed as described in methods and detailed in Fig. 5. The FBG domains of
each FREP are denoted by their gene name in GenBank. The name of the FREP from A. gambiae start with E, and the name of
the FREP from D. melanogaster start with A.
