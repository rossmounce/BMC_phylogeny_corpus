Abstract
Background: Variation of resource supply is one of the key factors that drive the evolution of lifehistory strategies, and hence the interactions between individuals. In the yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, two life-history strategies related to different resource utilization have been previously
described in strains from different industrial origins. In this work, we analyzed metabolic traits and
life-history strategies in a broader collection of yeast strains sampled in various ecological niches
(forest, human body, fruits, laboratory and industrial environments).
Results: By analysing the genetic and plastic variation of six life-history and three metabolic traits,
we showed that S. cerevisiae populations harbour different strategies depending on their ecological
niches. On one hand, the forest and laboratory strains, referred to as extreme "ants", reproduce
quickly, reach a large carrying capacity and a small cell size in fermentation, but have a low
reproduction rate in respiration. On the other hand, the industrial strains, referred to as extreme
"grasshoppers", reproduce slowly, reach a small carrying capacity but have a big cell size in
fermentation and a high reproduction rate in respiration. "Grasshoppers" have usually higher
glucose consumption rate than "ants", while they produce lower quantities of ethanol, suggesting
that they store cell resources rather than secreting secondary products to cross-feed or poison
competitors. The clinical and fruit strains are intermediate between these two groups.
Conclusions: Altogether, these results are consistent with a niche-driven evolution of S. cerevisiae,
with phenotypic convergence of populations living in similar habitat. They also revealed that
competition between strains having contrasted life-history strategies ("ants" and "grasshoppers")
seems to occur at low frequency or be unstable since opposite life-history strategies appeared to
be maintained in distinct ecological niches.

Background
Resource supply is one of the most important ecological
factors that drive the evolution of organisms. Therefore
the metabolic pathways implicated in external resource

consumption are expected to have an essential role in the
evolution of life-history traits. Two different strategies for
exploiting resources are commonly described. In the "selfish" strategy the individuals are consuming quickly

resources and increase their own reproduction rate. In the
"cooperative" strategy the individuals save resources for
the whole group at the expense of their own reproduction
rate. In the latter case, individuals are supposed to exploit
resource slowly but efficiently. When individuals share
common resources, there is a dilemma in which individuals that act selfishly consume rapidly the common
resources, reducing the fitness of the whole group, which
leads to what has been called the "tragedy of the commons" [1]. The central principle of such a "social conflict"
is that there must be a trade-off between individual shortterm and population long-term interests. This metaphor
reflecting a dilemma between individual and population
interests has been used in a vaste diversity of fields in science, from the evolution of competition and cooperation
in insect societies [2] to intra-genomic conflict [3], and
even to propose a solution to alleviate and improve the
work of reviewers [4].
In the case of heterotrophic microorganisms, the existence
of a dilemma between selfish and cooperative strategies
has been proposed to result from a metabolic trade-off
between the rate and efficiency of resource use [5,6]. A
high rate of ATP production per unit of time is associated
with a high reproduction rate and is considered as a selfish
strategy, whereas a high yield of ATP production, i.e. the
number of units of ATP per unit of resource consumed, is
associated with a low reproduction rate but with a high
biomass production, and is considered a cooperative strategy. The evolutionary significance of such a trade-off has
been studied using both experimental and theoretical
approaches in the context of evolutionary game theory
[7]. The outcome of competition between selfish and
cooperative strains for a common resource is that a selfish
strain with a high rate of ATP production always wins over
the prudent strain with a high yield of ATP production [810]. The maintenance of highly efficient cooperative
strains is only possible in case of spatially structured environment or in case of density-dependent cost of selfish
metabolism (toxins productions for instance) [9-11].
The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is able to use two main
metabolic strategies. The respiration allows a high efficiency of resource conversion into energy but at low rate.
The fermentation is associated with a low efficiency of
resource conversion into energy but a high metabolic rate.
Mathematical modelling as well as construction of engineered strains of S. cerevisiae, either respirer or respiro-fermenter, have shown that coexistence or competitive
exclusion between these two strategies could occur [11].
The analysis of these two metabolic strategies in natural
populations had not yet been carried out. Although the
genomic structure of S. cerevisiae populations begins to be
studied [12-17], very few studies are dedicated to the phenotypic characterisation of yeast populations coming
from different ecological niches. We showed in a previous

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/296

paper that the genetic variability of metabolic and life-history traits distributes the industrial strains between two
extreme life-history strategies [18]. The "grasshopper"
strains have a high specific glucose consumption rate in
fermentation, a large cell size but a low carrying capacity,
while the "ant" strains have a low specific glucose consumption rate, a small cell size and a high carrying capacity. In other words, the "grasshoppers" behave as selfish
strains allocating resource to their own cell size, while the
"ants" behave as cooperative strains saving resource
allowing a high population size to be reached.
The presence of these strategies in other habitats than
industrial ones has not yet been addressed. Moreover,
because of lack of genetic variation on reproduction rate
in the studied collection of industrial strains, the previous
data did not allow to ask question about the relationship
between metabolic strategies and reproduction rate.
Finally, life-history traits were studied in fermentation
and correlated variation for performances during respiration was not studied.
In this paper, we asked whether different metabolic and
life-history strategies could be found in the broad range of
habitats of S. cerevisiae. We analyzed the plastic and
genetic components of six life-history traits (intrinsic
reproduction rate, carrying capacity, cell size, reproduction rate in fermentation, time of the shift between fermentation and respiration, and reproduction rate in
respiration) and three metabolic traits (glucose consumption rate, ethanol production, fermentation yield) in 19
strains coming from forest, human body, laboratory,
fruits and various industrial origins [18]. Strains were
grown in two culture media differing in their amount of
resource (1% and 15% glucose) allowing both fermentation and respiro-fermentation processes to be investigated.

Methods
Biological Material
Nineteen diploid strains of S. cerevisiae were chosen from
the CIRM-Levures (Centre International de Ressources
Microbiennes, Thiverval-Grignon, France), the Saccharomyces Genome Resequencing Project collection (Sanger
Institute, Cambridge, UK) and Justin Fay's Collection
(Washington University in St. Louis - School of Medicine,
St. Louis, USA). The collection included strains isolated
from forest, coconut and cactus fruits, human body, laboratory, brewery and winery, and has been formed in order
to group together at least 3 strains from each type of habitat (Table 1). For each strain, a reference stock was conserved at -80°C in our lab.
Culture Conditions and Measurements
For measuring accurately various life-history and metabolic traits, the strains were grown in the same artificial

laboratory conditions. Growth kinetics were realized in
two liquid media containing 3% Yeast Nitrogen Base with
amino acids and differing by their glucose content, 1%
and 15%. One percent glucose corresponds to a low concentration, commonly used in laboratory conditions,
while 15% glucose is close to the concentration found in
sap or fruits. We chose this nitrogen concentration to
make sure that the glucose is the sole limiting nutrient. At
1% glucose concentration, yeast populations are supposed to grow first in fermentation then to switch to respiration. At 15% glucose concentration, yeast populations
are supposed to grow only in fermentation, and are submitted to osmotic stress. The cultures were incubated at
30°C under 200 rpm agitation. In these conditions, yeast
is exclusively reproducing by mitosis. After an overnight
culture, around 106 cells were put into 40 mL fresh
medium (30°C, 200 rpm). During growth kinetics, two
samples (1 mL and 200 μL) were taken at seven time
points (t = 4, 9, 13, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h) to estimate: (i)
the glucose and ethanol concentrations, (ii) the population density and mean cell size measured with a counter
Beckman Coulter® Z2. Each growth kinetics was repeated
independently from two to four times. Each replication
was performed with a new colony from the reference
stock.
Life-history traits
Life-history traits were measured by analyzing the population dynamics. In batch culture, the changes over time of
the cell number are classically analysed using a logistic
model (exponential growth followed by a stationary

phase) in order to estimate population dynamics parameters. However, a diauxic shift occurs in the 1% glucose
medium dividing the dynamics into two parts: after a first
period of growth in fermentation with production of ethanol, yeast shifts its metabolism and the respiration process takes place using ethanol as a carbon source.
Therefore, the population dynamics was analyzed using
two adjustment models (Figure 1).
First, the cell number over time was log-transformed, and
a segmented regression model [19] was used to estimate
the parameters of the transition between fermentation
and respiration (Tshift). The slope in fermentation gave the
population reproduction rate in fermentation (Rferm), the
population size at Tshift gave the carrying capacity in fermentation and the slope after the Tshift gave the population reproduction rate in respiration after the diauxic shift
(Rresp) (Figure 1A). This adjustment procedure was
applied using the "segmented" package under R software.
Although a diauxic shift is not supposed to occur in 15%
glucose medium, some strains appear to have a small respiration phase in this condition (Rresp different from zero)
and we therefore used the method in the two media.
Second, a logistic model of population dynamics was fitted to experimental datapoints in fermentation (the
points before Tshift):

Nt =

KN 0e rt
,
K + N 0(e rt −1)

Figure 1
Variation of population sizes overtime during the growth kinetics
Variation of population sizes overtime during the growth kinetics. Examples of experimental data points (strain
YPS1009) are presented with red (15% glucose) and blue dots (1% glucose). Two methods were used for fitting experimental
data points and estimating life-history trait values. A) a segmented regression (red and blue broken lines) of log-transformed
data points allowed us to estimate the reproduction rate in fermentation (Rferm), the time point of the diauxic shift (Tshift), the
population size at the end of the fermentation process (carrying capacity K), and the reproduction rate in respiration (Rresp). B)
an adjustment to a logistic model allowed us to estimate the intrinsic growth rate (r) and the carrying capacity (K).

where Nt is the population size at time t, K is the carrying
capacity (maximum population size, reached when glucose is exhausted), N0 is the initial population size and r
is the intrinsic reproduction rate (maximum rate of
increase of the population, i.e. at the beginning of the
kinetics when there is no competition). Fitting the growth
kinetics with this model allowed estimating K and r (Fig
1B).
As expected, a significant positive correlation was
observed between the intrinsic growth rate r estimated by
the second procedure and Rferm obtained from the first
procedure (ρ15% = 0.74 and ρ1% = 0.77). Therefore we
chose to focus only on Rferm.
As ethanol was not completely consumed after 96 hours,
when the experiments were stopped, we did not have
access to the population size (carrying capacity), cell size
and yield (population size × cell size) at the end of the respiration process. We thus focused on the cell size, carrying
capacity and yield at the end of the fermentation process.
Mean cell size (Scell) was therefore analyzed at the end of
the fermentation process, i.e. at the time point the closest
to Tshift.

Metabolic traits
Glucose consumption rate and ethanol production
Glucose and ethanol extracellular concentrations were
measured using enzymatic kits (rBiopharm, Darmstadt,
Germany). We estimated the glucose consumption rate as
described in [18]. The glucose consumption rate at T50
(when 50% of the glucose was consumed) was divided by
the population size at the same time point in order to
infer a specific glucose consumption rate denoted Jspec (g
× min-1 × cell-1). Note that the T50 falls during the exponential phase of the fermentation process in the two
media (approximately after 8 hours and 20 hours respectively in the 1% and in the 15% glucose medium). We
also measured the maximal quantity of ethanol produced
and released in the medium (Ethmax), which occurred at
the end of the fermentation or at the beginning of the respiration process, i. e. close to Tshift.
Fermentation yield
In microbiology, the yield is classically estimated through
the measurement of the OD per unit of glucose consumed
[20]. However, the correlation between OD value and
biomass (product of the mean cell size by the population
size [18]) is only ρ = 0.77. So we estimated directly the fer-

mentation yield, Yferm, using the ratio of the biomass over
the quantity of glucose consumed. We did not consider
the yield of respiration because we did not reach the plateau of this process.
Microsatellite analysis
Yeast DNA extraction and microsatellite PCR amplifications were carried out as described in [21]. Eight microsatellites (three dinucleotide and five trinucleotide repeats)
were analysed. They are located on 7 different chromosomes, mostly in non coding region.
Statistical Analysis
A Principal Component Analysis was first conducted on
all traits (both life-history and metabolic traits) averaged
over replications to visualize the distribution of the strains
on the plane defined by the two axes explaining the largest
part of variation.

Then the factors accounting for the variation of each variable among media and strains were analyzed with a mixed
analysis of variance model:
Z ijkl = m + Block i + medium j + Block * medium ij + ori k + Strain(ori) kl
+medium * ori jk + medium * Strain(ori) jkl + e ijkl

(2)
where Z is the quantitative variable (K, Scell, Rferm, Tshift,
Jspec, Ethmax or Yferm), Block is the random block effect
(experimental repetition) (i = 1, 2, 3, 4), medium is the
medium effect (j = 1, 2), ori is the origin effect (k = 1, 2, 3,
4, 5), Strain is the random strain effect within habitat of
origin (l = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), Block*medium (random),
medium*ori (fixed) and medium*Strain(ori) (random) are
interaction effects and ε is the residual error.
For each trait, the normality and homogeneity of the
residual distributions were studied. For all traits except
Rresp and Jspec, a logarithmic transformation proved to be
necessary to have normally and homogeneously distributed residues. The variables Rresp and Jspec displayed particular distributions. We chose to realize the ANOVA on the
average values over the experimental repetitions for Rresp,
and on the log-transformed average values over the experimental repetitions for Jspec. This resulted in homogeneity
and normality of the residual distributions, but the
ANOVA model used was less powerful:
Z ijk = m + medium i + ori j + Strain(ori) jk + medium * ori ij + e ijk

(3)
where Z is the variable (Rresp or Jspec), medium is the
medium effect (i = 1, 2), ori is the origin effect (j = 1, 2, 3,
4, 5), Strain is the random strain effect within industrial

origin (l = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), medium*ori is a fixed interaction
effect and ε is the residual error.
The average performances of strains of different origins
were compared using the least square estimation of Yk
obtained by averaging the phenotypic value over strains
from the same origin. Least square mean and variance estimates were obtained from JMP Procedure (SAS Institute
Inc.). Significance of differences between means was
assessed using Tukey HSD method.
Genetic Correlations between life-history traits
The 19 strains were not phylogenetically independent.
Based on microsatellite length differences, we computed a
matrix of genetic Euclidian distances between all pairs of
strains. This matrix was used to specify the variance structure in a multivariate generalized linear model. Correlations between traits were calculated based on variance/
covariance component estimates by MCMC method.
Prior distribution for variance and covariance components of the G-matrix (the genetic variance/covariance
matrix) and of the R-matrix (the residual variance/covariance matrix) were chosen according to the package documentation (inverse Wishart distributions). These analyses
were performed under R software using 'ape' [22] and
'MCMCglmm' (Hadfield, J: MCMC methods for Multiresponse Generalised Linear Mixed Models: The MCMCglmm R package, submitted) packages.

As we tested for 20 correlations, we corrected p-values
using a local FDR (False Discovery Rate) procedure [23].
Relationships between life-history and metabolic traits
In each glucose condition, the variability of life-history
traits was compared to the variability of metabolic traits,
according to the regression model:

Yil = aX il + b + D + e il .

(4)

where Yil is the mean value over repetitions of a life-history trait of the strain i in the medium l and Xil is the mean
value over repetitions of a metabolic trait (Jspec, Ethmax or
Yferm) of the strain i in the medium l. D represents the phylogenetic distance matrix and εil is the residual error term.
We corrected p-values for multiple tests as previously.

Results
We measured five life-history traits (the carrying capacity
K, the mean cell size in fermentation Scell, the reproduction rate in fermentation Rfermv, the reproduction rate in
respiration Rresp and the time to reach the carrying capacity
in fermentation Tshift) and three metabolic traits (the glucose consumption rate Jspec, the maximal quantity of ethanol released in the medium Ethmax and Yferm) in a
collection of 19 strains coming from various habitats

(industry, forest, fruit, clinical, laboratory) and grown in
two contrasted culture media (1% and 15% glucose).
Effect of the glucose content of the medium
We performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to
decompose the contribution of each quantitative trait on
the variation between strains (Figure 2). The major part of
the variation was explained by the first two axes (72%) of
the PCA. A clear separation was observed between the
strains grown in different glucose conditions. This separation was mainly explained by variation of metabolic traits
(Jspec, Ethmax and Yferm) and of two life-history traits: K,
which should be the direct reflect of the resource availability in the medium, and Rresp, because respiration is present
only in the 1% glucose medium. The ANOVA confirmed
that the medium effect is very large for these traits (Tables
2, 3). The variables Ethmax, K and Tshift increased with glucose content in the medium, while Yferm, Jspec and Rresp had
opposite behaviors. Rresp was nearly equal to 0 in the 15%
glucose medium. Surprisingly, in average, Scell and Rferm
were not significantly affected by the glucose content of
the medium.

Genetic variation of life-history and metabolic traits
Within each glucose condition, the strains appeared to be
clustered according to their habitat of origin, and the variables that contributed mainly to this structure were lifehistory traits (r, Scell, Rferm and Tshift). The "habitat of origin" had a significant effect on K, Scell, Rferm and Yferm
(Table 2 &3). Globally, industrial strains had a large cell
size, reproduced slowly, reached a low carrying capacity
and produced a weak biomass per unit of resource consumed (Table 4). On the opposite, laboratory and forest
strains had a small cell size, reproduced quickly, reached
a high carrying capacity and were very efficient in converting glucose into biomass (Table 4). Clinical and fruit
strains were intermediate between these two contrasted
groups, fruit strains being closer to industrial strains and
clinical ones to forest and laboratory ones. Significant
genetic variation between strains coming from a same
habitat of origin was also found (Strain(ori) effect) for all
traits but for Scell (Table 2 &3). Note that genetic main
effects (ori and Strain(ori)) were significant neither for Ethmax nor for Jspec.

Block and Strain are main random effects while medium (1 and 15% glucose) and habitat of origin (ori: forest, industrial, clinical, fruit and laboratory)
are main fixed effects.

Genotype-by-environment interactions
The medium*Strain(ori) interaction effect was significant
for all traits. The medium*origin interaction effect was only
significant Rferm and Tshift. Industrial populations displayed a significantly higher Rferm value in 15% glucose
than in 1% glucose (p < 0.05), while the other types of
population harbour similar Rferm values in the two media.
Industrial populations displayed a lower Tshift value in
15% glucose than in 1% glucose, while it was the opposite
for the other types of populations.

(ρ15% = - 0.79 and ρ1% = - 0.73) (Figure 3A). A significant
positive correlation was observed between the carrying
capacity and the Rferm in each glucose condition (ρ15% =
0.87 and ρ1% = 0.87) (Figure 3B). Finally, a significant
negative correlation between Scell and Rferm in each glucose
condition (ρ15% = - 0.63 and ρ1% = - 0.79) was found in
agreement with the two previous relationships (Figure
3C).

Genetic correlations between life-history traits
Correlations between life-history traits were studied using
the average trait value for each strain in each glucose condition and taking into account the genetic relationships
between strains (Table 5).

The time to reach the carrying capacity (Tshift) was negatively correlated with Rferm in the 1% glucose medium
(ρ1% = - 0.81), indicating that, the faster cells reproduced,
the earlier they reached the carrying capacity in fermentation. More interestingly, a significant positive correlation
between Scell and Rresp (ρ15% = 0.82 and ρ1% = 0.73) was
detected.

We detected a significant negative correlation between the
carrying capacity K and the Scell in each glucose condition

Consequently, whatever the quantity of resource, life-history trait variation in S. cerevisiae populations distributes

The average value of the reproduction rate in fermentation (Rferm), the carrying capacity (K in number of cells per mL), the cell size (Scell in μm), and
the yield (Yferm = K × Scell) at the end of the fermentation process is reported for each habitat of origin. Significance of differences was assessed by
HSD Tukey tests. Levels that are not connected by the same letter are significantly different.

between two extreme life-history strategies: populations
of small cells reproduce quickly in fermentation and reach
rapidly a high carrying capacity at the expense of a small
reproduction rate in respiration, and populations of large
cells reproduce slowly in fermentation, reach a lower carrying capacity but reproduce faster in respiration.
Strategies of resource utilization
Relationships between each life-history and metabolic
traits were studied by linear regression using, as we did for
correlations, the average trait value for each strain in each
glucose condition and taking into account the genetics
relationships between strains. The Rferm was positively correlated with Yferm in the two glucose conditions (R215% =
80%, p < 10-4 and R21% = 84%, p < 10-4) (Figure 4A), while
Rresp was negatively correlated to Yferm in 1% glucose (R21%
= 68%, p = 0.003) (Figure 4B). These opposite behaviours
gave more weight to the marginally significant trade-offs
observed in both environments between the two different
reproduction rates (Table 5). Strains that were very efficient for the fermentation process (high reproduction rate
and high yield in biomass) seemed to be less efficient in
respiration.

In both media, Scell correlated negatively with Ethmax
(R215% = 68%, p < 0.001 and R21% = 67%, p < 0.024) (not
shown). In the 15% glucose medium, where fermentation
is the main process, an increase of the Rferm and of K were
significantly correlated with Ethmax (R215% = 47%, p <
0.013 and R215% = 61%, p = 0.001), while in 1% glucose,

where respiro-fermentation occurs, the Rresp was significantly negatively correlated to Ethmax (R21% = 26%, p <
0.0265). In other words, strains with small cell size that
were efficient in the fermentation process released high
amount of ethanol, while strains of large cell size, less efficient in fermentation, produced less ethanol and/or were
more able to re-consume it as a carbon source during the
respiration process.
Finally, in the 1% glucose medium, Jspec was negatively
correlated to the carrying capacity K and to the Yferm (R21%
= 61%, p < 0.04 and R21% = 58%, p = 0.032, Figure 4D) and
positively to the Scell (R21% = 49%, p = 0.05) (Figure 4C),
while in the 15% glucose medium no correlation between
Jspec and any life-history trait was observed.

Discussion and Conclusions
Life-history strategies in wild and domesticated
populations of S. cerevisiae
In a previous study, two opposite genetically-based lifehistory strategies have been described from the study of a
collection of twelve industrial strains of S. cerevisiae. Some
strains (the ''grasshoppers'') consumed quickly glucose,
reached a big cell size at the expense of their carrying
capacity, whereas other strains (the ''ants'') consumed
slowly glucose, reached a smaller cell size, but had a
higher carrying capacity [18]. We extended the panel of S.
cerevisiae strains to non-industrial populations to determine whether these two life-history strategies had arisen
as a consequence of domestication for food processing

utilization or could be found in natural habitats. We
showed that these two life-history strategies can be found
in other habitats and that the range of trait variation
between the two opposite strategies is larger when adding
populations from non-industrial sources. In addition, the
definition of the two opposite life-history strategies have
been refined by analysing not only fermentation but also
the respiration process: the "ants" reproduce quickly in
fermentation, reach a large carrying capacity but have a
small cell size and have a low reproduction rate in the respiration process, whereas the "grasshoppers" reproduce
slowly in fermentation, reach a small carrying capacity but
cells are big and their reproduction rate in respiration is
high. Moreover, the "grasshoppers" have higher or equal
glucose consumption rate than "ants" while the maximum quantity of ethanol released in fermentation is
lower. This suggests that "grasshoppers" store resources
inside the cell rather than secrete secondary products to
cross-feed or poison competitors during fermentation.
Their performance during the respiration process on the
other hand might be related to a better ethanol consumption rate as well as reallocation of intra-cellular stock. The
distribution of glycolysis carbons into the different intra
and extra cellular metabolites need to be studied for getting more insight into the physiological basis of "ant" and
"grasshopper" life-history strategies.
Niche-driven evolution of S. cerevisiae phenotypes
A significant "habitat of origin" effect for most of the lifehistory traits (K, Scell and Rferm) and for Yferm was found.
Despite a broad geographical origin, strains of the same
habitat had similar life-history strategy. Compared to the
other strains, the industrial strains can all be considered as
"grasshoppers", even though the distinction between
"ant" and "grasshopper" life-history strategies has been
initially defined within this group. The laboratory and for-

est strains can be considered as extreme "ants" and the
clinical and fruit strains as intermediate between these
two groups (Table 4). Phenotypic homogeneity of strains
coming from a same ecological niche supports the idea of
genetic exchange among strains coming from similar habitats, as highlighted by phylogenomics studies for wine,
laboratory and clinical-fruit strains [12-14,16,17,24]. In
addition, homogenizing selection may lead to phenotypic
convergence in geographical distant but similar habitats.
This hypothesis seems to explain why the three sequenced
laboratory strains (S288C, SK1 and Y55), which are the
most genetically distant strains [16], have close life-history traits. In the case of forest strains our data also confirm a recent study on the variation of stress responses
showing that oak strains are phenotypically more similar
than expected from their genetic relationships [25]. Altogether, these results support the idea of a niche-driven
evolution of S. cerevisiae with phenotypic convergence of
populations living in similar habitat.
The harshness of the winter season may be one of the key
factors of the differentiation between "ants" and
"grasshoppers"
The close phenotypic proximity between laboratory
strains and forest strains, both having "ant" life-history
strategies, is striking. Thinking about the environmental
conditions common to these two groups of strains may
help understanding what drives the evolution towards
"ant" or "grasshopper" strategies. Both oak and laboratory
strains appeared to live in low resource media. Oak strains
have been isolated from bark or soil and laboratory strains
are often grown in 1 or 2% glucose media. A lack of
resource may lead to an "ant" strategy. Another explanation can be that both oak and laboratory strains have
undergone freeze-thaw cycles related to environmental
seasonality in forest or experimental utilization in

research. Oak related strains have been demonstrated to
be freeze-thaw resistant which have been hypothesized as
an important advantage to survive to winter niche [25].
On the opposite, "grasshopper" strains would not have
had the opportunity to adapt to multiple freeze-thaw
cycles because of their habitat of origin. The fruit strains
used are coming from Philippines, Hawaii and Bahamas,
and have probably never experienced freezing before their
isolation. Similarly, clinical isolates are expected to live at
human body temperature even though their exact mode

of transmission and life cycle are unknown. Finally,
industrial strains are probably living in quite controlled
environments with no drastic temperature changes as
expected in wine cellars [26].
This hypothesis is supported by our knowledge on freeze
tolerance which is expected to be higher in smaller cells.
Freezing tolerance has been related to cell size in S. cerevisiae [27,28], Torulaspora delbrueckii [29], Candida utilis,
Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum, and the human

leukemia K562 cells [30] and may have driven the evolution towards "ant" life-history strategy. A physical explanation could be that the larger surface-to-volume ratio of
the small cells makes easier the release of water out of the
cell and the decrease of intracellular pressure. Moreover,
the formation of ice crystals leading to the mechanical disruption of cell components may be higher in large cells
[30]. Selection experiments under variable "winter-season" length and temperature should be conducted to test
these hypotheses.
Tragedy of the commons in S. cerevisiae populations Where are we?
Competition for resources can lead to a "tragedy of the
commons", i. e. a dilemma between using resource selfishly to the detriment of the long-term survival of the population, or saving resource for the whole community at
the expense of its own reproduction. These two opposite
types of resource utilization have already been described
in yeast and are often illustrated by the trade-off between
the rate of glucose uptake (supposed to be high in selfish
strains) and yield (supposed to be improved in cooperative strains) [20]. However, the trade-off between the yield
and the resource uptake rate is commonly found in low
glucose media but does not seem to be detected in richer
media. In 15% glucose medium, where fermentation is
the main physiological process, the trade-off between the
yield and the resource uptake rate was not detected among
industrial strains [18] and was not detected here in a panel
of strains representing a larger genetic diversity. This gives
evidence for an environment-dependent rate/yield tradeoff, which reflects the biochemical trade-off between fermentation and respiration, but it does not seem to occur
in fermentation.

Competition for resources and social conflict between
"ants" and "grasshoppers" does not seem to commonly
occur since the two opposite life-history strategies appear
to be maintained in distinct ecological niches. Intermediary phenotypes, such as clinical and fruit strains, which
have been previously described as resulting from
exchanges between isolated genetic groups because of the
mosaic composition of their genomes [16,17], could be
the evolutionary outcomes of the competition and/or
hybridization between "ants" and "grasshoppers".
Human body and fruit have indeed been proposed to be
environments that are regularly colonized by yeast coming from various geographical and ecological origins
[16,17] and thus could be locations where strains of the
two opposite life-history strategies meet and compete.
However, the outcome of their competition remains difficult to predict. In a one-season time-scale in fermentation,
"ants" may win the competition: they save resources,
reproduce fast and invest preferentially resources in the
carrying capacity at the expense of their own cell size. In a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/296

context of long-term competition through multiple seasons with fermentation/respiration cycles, "grasshoppers"
should be the "winners". Although they reproduce slowly
and reach a lower carrying capacity, they use resources
quickly and store them inside the cell which may allow a
better survival to starving conditions. In fermentation,
they produce a small amount of "toxic" ethanol. In respiration, they may re-consume efficiently ethanol as a carbon source since they reproduce quickly. "Ants" and
"grasshoppers" could both be considered as "selfish competitors" depending on the moment of the season.
Therefore, determining the cooperative or selfish nature of
each of the two life-history strategies raised no consensus
and depends both on the environment and on the time
scale. Mathematical modelling and experimental validations of short and long-term competition between "ants"
and "grasshoppers" in various habitats should be developed to study the evolutionary outcome of competitions
between them.
