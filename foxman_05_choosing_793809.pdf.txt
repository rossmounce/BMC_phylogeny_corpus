Abstract
A wide variety of bacterial typing systems are currently in use that vary greatly with respect to the
effort required, cost, reliability and ability to discriminate between bacterial strains. No one
technique is optimal for all forms of investigation. We discuss the desired level of discrimination
and need for a biologic basis for grouping strains of apparently different types when using bacterial
typing techniques for different epidemiologic applications: 1) confirming epidemiologic linkage in
outbreak investigations, 2) generating hypotheses about epidemiologic relationships between
bacterial strains in the absence of epidemiologic information, and 3) describing the distributions of
bacterial types and identifying determinants of those distributions. Inferences made from molecular
epidemiologic studies of bacteria depend upon both the typing technique selected and the study
design used; thus, choice of typing technique is pivotal for increasing our understanding of the
pathogenesis and transmission, and eventual disease prevention.

Introduction

Analysis

Ever since Koch discovered how to grow bacteria in pure
culture, the laboratory has been an integral component of
epidemiologic studies of bacterial diseases. Over time, our
ability to discriminate among bacterial strains from the
same species has increased, enhancing outbreak investigations and surveillance, studies of the natural history of
infection, and our understanding of the transmission,
pathogenesis and phylogeny of bacteria.

Bacterial typing systems
Traditional typing systems for discriminating between
bacteria from a single species have been based on phenotype, such as serotype, biotype, phage typing, or antibiogram (susceptibility to one or more antibiotics). More
recently, techniques have been developed based on indirect measures of genetic sequence (such as pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE)) and direct measures of genetic
sequence (such as multilocus sequence typing (MLST)).

array technologies, comparing strains to a reference strain
(comparative genomic hybridization) is now technically
feasible; however, the cost and time required limits the
applicability for most epidemiologic studies. For example,
in 2005, total genomic sequencing costs roughly 100 to
500 times more per strain than comparative hybridization
(~$100,000 to $500,000 versus ~$1000 to $2000), and
MLST (~$140) is quite costly compared to PFGE (~$20).
Further, we have yet to characterize the range of variability
among bacterial strains of a single species by various techniques, and thus lack an appropriate context for interpreting
the
observed
variation.
Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the chosen bacterial typing technique enhances interpretation
and generalization of study results. A summary of common typing techniques and the relative discriminatory
power, repeatability (same test result, given random error,
for same analysis on same sample in the same laboratory),
reproducibility (same test result, given random error, for
same analysis on same sample in a different laboratory),
timing and cost is presented in Table 1; techniques have
been recently reviewed elsewhere [1-3]. We have ordered
techniques from those with the highest to lowest discriminatory power, that is, ability to distribute strains into the
greatest number of groups. Thus, if the entire genome of a
bacteria is sequenced we will be able to detect even very
small differences between strains, for example, changes in
gene sequence that do not cause changes in the expressed
proteins, such as point mutations that naturally occur
over time as the bacteria divides. Common typing techniques used in epidemiologic studies sequence one or
more genetic regions, for example multi-locus sequence
typing (MLST), or use enzymes to cut part or all of the
genome into pieces, for example, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The number and size of the pieces correspond to
the number and location of restriction sites cut by the
enzymes, and thus are an indirect measure of sequence.
Other common techniques use the polymerase chain reaction targeted to specific sequences, for example ERIC-PCR;
the resulting reactions yield fragments of different sizes,
which can be used to discriminate between bacterial
types. Generally speaking, sequence-based methods are
most repeatable and reproducible. Gel-based methods are
less so, because of the inherent variability of the technique
[2,3].
Our intention is not to focus on a particular technique, as
the techniques continue to change rapidly. Instead, we
discuss the strengths and weaknesses of current bacterial
typing techniques for particular epidemiologic applications, and provide some insight into what characteristics
a typing technique should have when applied to a specific
research question. We recognize that choice of a molecular tool is often up to laboratory personnel and not the

http://www.epi-perspectives.com/content/2/1/10

epidemiologist; however, laboratorians are not always
involved in study design or the interpretation of study
results (although this is highly desirable). A laboratorian,
whose expertise is in a particular typing technique, cannot
be expected to give appropriate advice if s/he does not
understand the research question asked. Similarly, an epidemiologist cannot appropriately analyze and interpret
results of a typing technique if s/he does not understand
what it is measuring. Furthermore, if there is a mismatch
between typing technique and research question, the
study results are less likely to answer the research question. Unfortunately, epidemiologists and laboratorians
often have little training in each other's fields, do not
share a common vocabulary, and have very different
research perspectives. Thus, our goal is to provide guidance for the epidemiologist about working collaboratively
with laboratories to choose the appropriate bacterial typing technique, and for interpreting the results.
Epidemiologic Applications of Bacterial Typing
Techniques
Discriminatory power is the average probability that a typing system will assign the same strain type to strains randomly sampled from the same group. In a typical analysis,
epidemiologists use questionnaire data to discriminate
between groups. For example, if investigating a foodborne
outbreak associated with a picnic, then the variable 'ate
food at the picnic' will be a poor discriminator of disease
risk (as probably all ate), but 'ate potato salad' or even 'ate
potatoes' might accurately classify individuals into high
and low risk groups (if an ingredient in the potato salad,
such as the eggs or mayonnaise, was the culprit). If we
classify individuals into groups by all variables measured
simultaneously (e.g., age, gender, food preferences, medical history, etc.), then our measure will be highly discriminatory (as each individual might fall into a separate
group) – although not necessarily informative with
respect to disease risk. Thus, the most discriminatory
grouping is not necessarily the most informative, particularly if the groupings are not associated with the outcome
of interest.

Bacterial typing techniques are analogous, but may or
may not provide an appropriately discriminatory grouping (similar to 'ate potato salad'). We have identified three
purposes where molecular typing techniques are applied
in epidemiologic studies (Table 2). We give an example of
a research goal that relates to each purpose, provide an
assessment of the required discriminatory power and
need to infer genetic relationships and/or population
structure for that particular application. Each purpose is
discussed, in turn, below.
First, however, we wish to point out that bacterial typing
is not always the correct classification tool, as outbreaks

are not always caused by a single, virulent clone. Contamination of the water or food supply by sewage can lead to
an outbreak of diarrhea caused by a variety of different
agents [4-6] although clonal outbreaks also occur following sewage contamination [7]. Other examples are the
breakdown of abattoir procedures that lead to contamination from cows colonized with diverse agents, or of nursery hygiene procedures allowing transmission from
visitors
to
children.
Further, strain typing results must be interpreted in the
context of epidemiologic evidence as well as the characteristics of the bacteria. Neither laboratory nor epidemiologic evidence is definitive, but each validates the other.
When epidemiologic evidence suggests contamination
arising from diverse sources, stricter molecular typing criteria should not be used to classify cases as epidemic
related. If typing data suggests a high degree of similarity,
epidemiologic evidence should be sought relevant to a
single contamination episode.
Confirm Epidemiologic Linkage
One of the most common applications of bacterial typing
in an epidemiologic study is in the context of an outbreak
investigation. Bacterial typing is used to confirm or refute
epidemiologic evidence that cases are linked or that a particular food item, water source, or fomite was the source

of infection. In this situation the laboratory data is essentially confirmatory and the required discriminatory power
and need to infer genetic relationships or structure is low.
If there is strong epidemiologic evidence linking a specific
food item with disease (common or point source), for
example, we often make public health decisions based on
that evidence alone – even if there is no supporting laboratory evidence. In the vast majority of foodborne outbreaks, the suspected food is not available for culture and
a definitive linkage cannot be demonstrated [8]. Nonetheless, these investigations often successfully identify correctable breaks in hygiene practice. However, even
modestly discriminatory techniques are useful since the
laboratory evidence confirms the epidemiologic findings.
For this type of confirmation, using a rapid and inexpensive technique (like ERIC-PCR) might be preferred since
the cost and time associated with a more definitive technique (like MLST) would add little to our understanding
of the source of infection or the ultimate policy decision.
Generate hypotheses about epidemiologic relationships between
bacterial strains in the absence of epidemiologic data
Molecular typing has increased the power of surveillance
data to detect outbreaks. The Foodborne Diseases Active
Surveillance Network (FoodNet) conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses pulsed-field
gel electrophoresis to type surveillance isolates for several

foodborne pathogens, including E. coli O157:H7, nontyphoidal Salmonella serotypes, Listeria monocytogenes and
Shigella [9]. Bacterial typing of space-time clusters has
identified unsuspected linkages triggering investigations,
as well as demonstrating that apparent clusters were not
related, ruling out need for investigation [10].
Molecular typing also facilitates the detection of chains of
transmission. Molecular typing led to a reassessment of
the epidemiology of tuberculosis in the United States by
establishing that tuberculosis does not require prolonged
contact but can be transmitted in casual settings [11]. Typing also allows us to relate clinical outcome to strain
types, distinguishing recent tuberculosis infection from
reactivation of disease, [12] and establishing that an individual can be infected with a second, different tuberculosis strain following initial infection [13].
When the investigator needs to identify potential outbreaks by typing surveillance isolates, or to distinguish
between point source and propagated outbreaks, a more
discriminatory technique is required. In a common or
point source outbreak we expect the causative agent to be
similar in all infected persons. Therefore, a more discriminatory technique is necessary to determine if a space-time
cluster of isolates detected via surveillance represents a
potential outbreak compared to a technique for typing
isolates already epidemiologically linked. In a propagated
outbreak or when tracking chains of transmission, the
genetic sequence of the bacteria may be slightly different
at the end compared to the beginning of the outbreak
(how fast this occurs depends on the bacteria, however).
If the bacteria are naturally competent, i.e., easily uptake
DNA from other members of the species, such as nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae [14], a highly discriminatory typing technique may erroneously misclassify epidemic cases identified at the end of the epidemic as nonepidemic, particularly if there are no endemic strains
available for comparison. Using a typing technique that
allows classification consistent with phylogenetic relationships (e.g., MLST), or, if the bacteria is highly recombinant, with clonal complexes, is helpful as there is a
biologically meaningful way to group strains (that is, logically collapse groups of related strains). Unfortunately,
many typing techniques are analogous to nominal scales,
e.g., ERIC: the groups are different from each other, but we
cannot say which of the identified groups are more similar
than others. Even for PFGE, which can be used to assess
relatedness, similarity may vary by choice or number of
restriction enzymes used. Further, the published criteria
for PFGE relatedness (based on number of matching
bands) were intended solely for outbreak situations and
when isolates were collected over a short time period (<1
year) and there is an implied epidemiologic linkage [15].

Describe distribution of bacterial types and identify the determinants
of that distribution
Advances in molecular genetics have facilitated the
description of the genetic diversity of bacterial populations. Molecular genetic techniques have been used to distinguish if there have been independent spontaneous
mutations leading to antibiotic resistance or if resistance
was transmitted between strains via a mobile genetic element. In other applications molecular genetic techniques
have determined the flow of infection from one group to
another. These descriptive molecular epidemiologic studies often use strains collected from disparate areas and the
epidemiologic and clinical information is minimal or
non-contributory. In this case the chosen bacterial typing
technique must be interpretable in terms of genetic distance (phylogeny) for the given time period and organism. Further, the technique should reflect whether the
hypothesis is of clonal spread of a strain or of a mobile
genetic element, (e.g., plasmid).

Some typing techniques are based on conserved genes
within the bacterial genome, e.g., genes associated with
metabolism or other 'housekeeping' functions, and others
on more variable genes, e.g., genes associated with virulence. On average, when bacterial strains are compared
using a genetic typing technique, there are fewer genetic
differences between bacterial strains in the conserved
genes than variable genes. Thus, typing techniques based
on differences in conserved genes, such as MLST, will
place strains into fewer, larger, groups, than typing techniques based on more variable genes, such as PFGE. Put
another way, PFGE is generally more discriminatory than
MLST.
For bacterial characteristics that are dependent both on
the conserved and variable portions of the genome, such
as virulence, the use of multiple typing techniques may be
helpful, see, for example, [16]. Selection of the appropriate typing technique and a valid interpretation of the
results for studies of distribution of bacterial types and the
determinants of that distribution is easiest when at least
some preliminary data are available. For example, knowledge of the rarity of the observed groups in the community, propensity of the species to acquire insertion
elements or phage, the timing of strain collection and the
evolutionary clock of the organism, that is, how quickly
mutations occur or horizontal elements are acquired provides important information for both technique selection
and interpretation of resulting findings.
The identification of pathogenic factors is an exercise in
identifying what is different between strains causing and
not causing disease. This identification proceeds in the
manner of a case-control study with the bacterial agent as
the unit of analysis [see, for example, [17]]. Standard epi-

demiologic study design issues apply: the study population must include both disease-causing and commensal
isolates. Most disease-causing strains will predominate in
a culture; non-pathogenic, or commensal organisms are
often comprised of a mixture of strains of the same species. The investigator must select isolates for study accordingly. For example, E. coli is a common bowel inhabitant
and is also the most common cause of urinary tract infection. Typically an individual has several E. coli strains in
the bowel flora but urinary tract infection among outpatients is almost always caused by a single strain. The investigator must decide if the predominant isolate in the
bowel flora is the one of interest or if several isolates
should be selected for testing. If the objective were to link
the bowel to the urinary tract flora, then choosing only the
predominant bowel strain would not be sufficient. Identifying common elements generating pathogenicity may be
the study objective: when the typing technique is unable
to discriminate between pathogenic and diverse commensal isolates, epidemiologic and clinical information
should be used to make that distinction, such as grouping
together E. coli that cause urinary tract infection.
Pathogenicity determinants are often present on transferable genetic material, such as plasmids, pathogenicity
islands, phages, etc. Transferable genetic material has a
genetic history distinct from the rest of the host bacterial
genome. In this case, phylogenetic analyses of these elements can provide useful information. For example, pathogenicity islands (PAIs) have been associated with a
variety of conditions, including diarrhea and urinary tract
infection [18-20]; specific virulence factor genes found on
the PAIs encode for proteins that contribute directly to
disease.

Conclusion
The application and interpretation of bacterial typing
tools in epidemiologic studies requires understanding of
both the strengths and limitations of the chosen bacterial
typing technique as well as the epidemiologic study
design to answer the research question. Beyond standard
reliability, validity and cost considerations, key characteristics of a typing technique are 1) the ability to discriminate between strains and 2) a biologic basis for grouping
strains with apparently different types. The level of discrimination required and need to be able to group strains
depends on the research question. Similar to the desirability of including a statistician in the design phase so that
the study design will result in appropriate data for the
desired analysis, integrating an expert in the different typing techniques during the design phase will improve how
well the research protocol fits the question(s) of interest.
