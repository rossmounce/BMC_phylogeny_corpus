Strong differences in the clonal variation of two
Daphnia species from mountain lakes affected by
overwintering strategy
Eva Hamrová1†, Joachim Mergeay2,3† and Adam Petrusek1*†

Abstract
Background: The population structure of cyclical parthenogens such as water fleas is strongly influenced by the
frequency of alternations between sexual and asexual (parthenogenetic) reproduction, which may differ among
populations and species. We studied genetic variation within six populations of two closely related species of
water fleas of the genus Daphnia (Crustacea, Cladocera). D. galeata and D. longispina both occur in lakes in the
Tatra Mountains (Central Europe), but their populations show distinct life history strategies in that region. In three
studied lakes inhabited by D. galeata, daphnids overwinter under the ice as adult females. In contrast, in lakes
inhabited by D. longispina, populations apparently disappear from the water column and overwinter as dormant
eggs in lake sediments. We investigated to what extent these different strategies lead to differences in the clonal
composition of late summer populations.
Results: Analysis of genetic variation at nine microsatellite loci revealed that clonal richness (expressed as the
proportion of different multilocus genotypes, MLGs, in the whole analysed sample) consistently differed between
the two studied species. In the three D. longispina populations, very high clonal richness was found (MLG/N
ranging from 0.97 to 1.00), whereas in D. galeata it was much lower (0.05 to 0.50). The dominant MLGs in all D.
galeata populations were heterozygous at five or more loci, suggesting that such individuals all represented the
same clonal lineages rather than insufficiently resolved groups of different clones.
Conclusions: The low clonal diversities and significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in D. galeata
populations were likely a consequence of strong clonal erosion over extended periods of time (several years or even
decades) and the limited influence of sexual reproduction. Our data reveal that populations of closely related Daphnia
species living in relatively similar habitats (permanent, oligotrophic mountain lakes) within the same region may show
strikingly different genetic structures, which most likely depend on their reproductive strategy during unfavourable
periods. We assume that similar impacts of life history on population structures are also relevant for other cyclical
parthenogen groups. In extreme cases, prolonged clonal erosion may result in the dominance of a single clone within a
population, which might limit its microevolutionary potential if selection pressures suddenly change.

Background
Many organisms are capable of alternating sexual and
asexual reproduction throughout their life cycle, including protists, cnidarians, rotifers, crustaceans, insects,
mosses, vascular plants and macro-algae [1]. The relative
importance of both reproduction strategies has profound

influences on the genetic structure of populations and
on the evolutionary response to selection pressures [2].
In many cases, sexual reproduction in such taxa is associated with the formation of dormant stages that ensure
population survival during unfavourable periods (i.e.,
dispersal through time), as well as spatial dispersal [3].
In aquatic environments that undergo regular seasonal
changes, including cold temperate lakes or temporary
ponds, many zooplankton groups such as water fleas
(Cladocera) usually survive unfavourable periods of winter or drought as dormant stages, and hatch at the onset

of more favourable conditions. The typical cladoceran
life cycle (reviewed in [2]) is thus cyclical parthenogenesis: females reproduce clonally under favourable conditions, and switch to male production and sexual
reproduction when conditions deteriorate.
Fertilized dormant eggs, usually encased in an ephippium, enter dormancy at an early embryonic stage,
endure unfavourable periods, and can hatch when the
conditions improve again. Each hatchling from a dormant egg of a cyclically parthenogenetic cladoceran has
a unique genotype [4,5]. Under this scenario, a high
number of genotypes may be expected at the beginning
of the growing season in such populations. However,
due to selection and drift during the prolonged period
of parthenogenetic reproduction, some clonal lineages
disappear, resulting in clonal erosion and a reduction in
effective population size. Apart from perceivable reductions in clonal and genetic diversity, this typically leads
to deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium,
and increases among-population genetic differentiation
as a result of enhanced genetic drift [4-6].
During parthenogenetic reproduction in the growing
season, genotypes best adapted to their local environment are favoured. This process often results in the
coexistence of a limited number of genotypes [7,8]. Clonal diversity is restored by sexual reproduction and the
subsequent hatching of recombinant genotypes. Additionally, genetic diversity can increase through hatching
of older dormant eggs produced during earlier growing
seasons [9]. However, prolonged periods of clonal selection, though benefiting certain clones, may have a negative impact on the population as a whole. Populations
where sexual reproduction is infrequent have lower
effective population sizes, and sometimes suffer from
inbreeding depression [10].
The above-mentioned processes are of course not limited to cladocerans. The genetic structure of cyclical
parthenogen populations in general is affected by the
strength of the clonal selection, length of the growing
season, and frequency of sexual reproduction [1,5]. A
reduction of clonal diversity over time has also been
observed in natural populations of rotifers (e.g., [11]),
aphids (e.g., [12]), as well as plants (e.g., [13]). Similarly,
the structure of strictly asexual populations composed
of different clones is affected by the frequency of formation or immigration of new clones, and clonal decay
[14]. If new clones are not replaced with sufficient frequency, a reduction of clonal diversity over time can be
expected due to neutral processes, even in the absence
of any selection advantage of particular clones [15].
An important group in which these phenomena have
been studied in detail is the cladoceran genus Daphnia.
These small crustaceans are key grazers of phytoplankton in temperate lakes. In such habitats, Daphnia have

two options to survive unfavourable winter conditions
[16]: 1) as dormant eggs, re-colonizing the water column
in spring as hatchlings; or 2) as active parthenogenetic
females overwintering in the water column. These two
strategies are not mutually exclusive, as a Daphnia
female may produce dormant eggs sexually and subsequently switch back to parthenogenetic reproduction
[17]. Variation in overwintering strategy has been
observed both between Daphnia species inhabiting the
same lake (e.g., [18]) and within the population of a single species (e.g., [16]). It has been also documented that
there is a substantial impact of different recruitment
strategies on the genetic structure of a Daphnia population among years with different weather conditions (in
particular, warm vs. cold winters) [19]. In the case of a
successful overwintering of maternal genotypes to the
next growing season, the period of clonal selection may
span many years, much longer than for populations relying on regular re-establishment from the dormant egg
bank [4,5]. Individual-based modelling [6] predicts that
the length of the parthenogenetic reproduction phase in
the Daphnia life cycle may be crucial for the resulting
clonal diversity. Therefore, different overwintering strategies are expected to have very different impacts on the
clonal structure of Daphnia populations, their effective
population size, and in the long term on their microevolutionary potential [2].
Accurate analyses of Daphnia clonal diversity, however, have long been hindered by a lack of suitable
genetic markers. Most studies in the past have used allozyme electrophoresis with limited genetic resolution to
detect multilocus genotypes (e.g., [8,19,20]). While this
method has brought valuable insights into processes
shaping populations diversity and structure, it is likely
that the clonal variation in natural populations was
often substantially underestimated [21]. The development of variable microsatellite markers for Daphnia
species has allowed much more sensitive genetic analyses, and increased the chances that different clones are
properly identified, and true clonal diversity better estimated (e.g., [16,21,22]).
In this study, we focus on the variation in clonal
structure of two Daphnia species inhabiting mountain
lakes in relation to their presumed overwintering strategy. We studied six Daphnia populations from lakes in
the Tatra Mountains (20°10’E, 49°10’N; the highest
mountain range of the Carpathians, on the border
between Slovakia and Poland; Figure 1) belonging to
two closely related species of the Daphnia longispina
complex, D. galeata and D. longispina (see [23] for phylogeny and nomenclatural issues in this complex). Both
studied species are found in several mountain lakes of
the region [24]. These taxa reproduce by cyclical parthenogenesis, and overwintering strategies for several local

populations are known. In three lakes inhabited by D.
galeata, individuals have been recorded under the ice,
while in another locality inhabited by D. longispina no
such individuals have been found (Table 1, Figure 1).
This latter population presumably survives the winter in
the form of dormant eggs only, although overwintering
of a small number of females, with densities below the
detection threshold, can never be completely excluded.

We assume that similar strategies may occur in other
populations living in environmentally similar conditions.
The survival of parthenogenetic females, even at low
densities, may have profound consequences for population structure, as such females have a short-term advantage at the beginning of the growing season compared
to dormant eggs [5]. This advantage may be further
enhanced if numerous individuals of the same clone

overwinter, as can be expected after a prolonged period
of clonal erosion. Using nine microsatellite loci, we
assessed the late-summer clonal structure in three populations of each of the above-mentioned Daphnia species
in order to reveal whether presumed differences in the
duration of clonal reproduction (due to different overwintering strategy) are reflected in clonal richness and
diversity.

Results
Populations of both species strikingly differed in their
clonal composition (Table 1, Figure 2). D. longispina
populations showed very high clonal richness as well as
diversity in the analysed samples. Clonal richness, calculated as the number of multilocus genotypes (MLGs)
detected in the sample divided by the total number of
studied individuals in each population (MLG/N), ranged
from 0.97 to 1.00; clonal diversity, calculated as the
complement of the maximum likelihood estimator of
the Simpson’s index, (1-D), reached the maximum possible value of 1.00 in all three populations. As these values
indicate, almost every single analysed D. longispina individual had a different multilocus genotype (MLG), with
the exception of two individuals with an identical MLG
from Vyšné Furkotské Lake. None of the D. longispina
populations significantly deviated from expectations of
the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The observed
among-population differentiation within this species was
high (Dest = 0.33). These patterns are apparent in the
factorial correspondence analysis (FCA) of multilocus
genotypes (Figure 2), in which the three D. longispina
populations form three mostly non-overlapping clusters
composed of numerous symbols, each representing a
different multilocus genotype.
D. galeata populations showed a very different pattern. Two populations (lakes Nižné Žabie Bielovodské
and Morskie Oko) were each dominated by a single
local genotype. Only one individual differed from the
dominant MLG in each of these two populations (Figure
2). The resulting values of clonal richness were accordingly low (0.05 and 0.06, respectively).
The dominant MLG in these populations was heterozygous at five out of nine loci, making it highly unlikely
that it harbours a substantial number of genotypes produced by sexual reproduction within the clone (i.e., due
to selfing). Moreover, the percentage of polymorphic
loci and allele richness in those populations was sufficient to detect possible sexually-produced MLGs. This
was confirmed by the analysis of MLG richness and
diversity of the randomised datasets simulating sexual
reproduction within populations with the same MLG
structure as recorded in the field (Table 1). Average
values obtained from 25 “artificial hybrid” samples (N =
40) based on each of these two D. galeata populations

Page 4 of 10

were much higher for both clonal richness (0.88 and
1.00) and diversity (0.97-1.00) than in the original samples, approaching rather those observed in D. longispina
populations. Furthermore, only 2.7 to 3.8% out of 1000
simulated “artificial hybrids” had MLGs identical to the
respective dominant clones.
The individuals that exhibited different MLGs in these
two lakes differed from the dominant ones at one locus
in Nižné Žabie Bielovodské and at two loci in Morskie
Oko, respectively; one allele at those variable loci was
always shared with the dominant MLG. Five and four
loci that were heterozygous in the dominant clones
were also identical in the rare MLGs. Such differences
correspond to distance classes 2 and 8, respectively,
between dominant and rare MLGs, as calculated in the
software GenoType. These are relatively small values;
identical or lower distances between pairs of 1000 randomised MLGs were observed in only 1.8 and 5.3% of
pairwise comparisons, respectively.
The third D. galeata population (from Štrbské Lake)
was more variable than the other two, with observed
values of clonal richness and diversity reaching 0.50 and
0.91, respectively. Several MLGs were detected multiple
times in the sample. The two most common ones were
detected seven and nine times, reaching respective proportions of 18 and 24% in the analysed sample of 38
individuals. These two locally dominant clones were heterozygous at nine and eight loci, respectively.
All three D. galeata populations showed significant
deviations from HWE, with a strong heterozygote excess
as a result of the dominance of heterozygous clones.
The observed among-population differentiation
expressed as the Dest value was even higher than in D.
longispina (0.42).

Discussion
The populations of two related Daphnia species from
the same mountain range strongly differed in their
degree of clonal diversity, consistently with assumptions
of their overwintering strategy. The differences in population structure between the two groups agree well with
predictions of a physiologically-structured model of
Daphnia life-history [6], which assessed the impact of
clonal erosion on the genetic structure as observed by
neutral markers.
Actively overwintering populations of D. galeata,
which undergo a prolonged period of clonal selection,
had much lower levels of clonal diversity, being almost
completely dominated by a single clone in two cases.
Moreover, the single individuals in these lakes that
exhibited different multilocus genotypes differed only
slightly from the dominant clones, being identical at a
number of heterozygous loci. It is therefore likely that
these individuals did not represent other hatchlings

from sexually-produced dormant eggs but the observed
differences were rather due to PCR artefacts or possibly
somatic mutations of the dominant clones. This is particularly likely for Nižné Žabie Bielovodské, in which the
rare MLG differed from the dominant MLG by a single
allele of one locus.
In contrast with the situation in D. galeata, intrapopulation variation of D. longispina was very high, similar to

what could be expected in an obligately sexual species
(as demonstrated by the analysis of datasets simulating
sexual reproduction in D. galeata; see also [4]).
Although we only have data on the absence of individuals under ice for one of the three studied D. longispina populations, we can assume that all three
populations most likely overwinter as dormant eggs, as
suggested by similar genetic variation patterns. High

Hamrová et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:231
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/231

clonal diversity suggests the limited influence of clonal
erosion and the strong impact of sexual reproduction,
which is consistent with the yearly re-establishment of
the active population from dormant egg banks [5].
The observed patterns of clonal variation suggest that
most populations we studied (apart from Štrbské Lake)
represent extreme cases in a continuum of overwintering strategies. The contribution of individuals surviving
the winter period to the next season’s population may
substantially differ, both among different localities (as
observed by us) and among years within the same locality [19]. The overwintering clones may belong to the
most successful ones within the population. The persistence of several genotypes during two years was
observed for Daphnia longispina in an artificial German
lake [22]; two such MLGs were the most common in
both studied years (ranging from 11 to 16% of all individuals in a particular sample). We assume that this
represents an intermediate situation in which both overwintering clones and new hatchlings substantially contribute to the genetic structure, a pattern probably
similar to the one observed for D. galeata in Štrbské
Lake.
A wide range of clonal diversities were observed for
multiple populations of the D. longispina complex from
various European habitats analysed by Thielsch et al.
[21]. The pattern was congruent with our observations the majority of D. longispina populations were characterised by very high clonal richness and diversity, but
two out of three populations of D. galeata included in
the analysis showed reduced variation. One of these was
from a Dutch lake, in which we assume Daphnia may
indeed persist year-round due to the relatively mild
oceanic climate. However, low MLG diversity does not
always correspond to long-term or strong clonal erosion.
For example, the lowest diversity among D. longispina
populations was reported from a small Tatra Mountain
lake, Vyšné Satanie [21]. In that case, however, it was
most likely due to low allelic richness and low heterozygosity (and thus limited ability to differentiate between
different MLGs), as it is unlikely that harsh winter conditions in this lake allow overwintering of cladocerans in
active stages. The low allele richness in that particular
population more probably results from an introduction
bottleneck when the population became re-established
after a period of severe anthropogenic acidification
[21,24].
Although we studied two different species, the overwintering strategy in the D. longispina complex is not
necessarily species-specific. Whether or not Daphnia
successfully survive the winter period is rather influenced by the ability to adapt to local conditions in a
particular lake [18,25,26]. For example, populations of
the same two species co-occurring in Lake Constance

Page 6 of 10

showed the opposite pattern to that observed in the
Tatra Mountains: D. longispina (labelled D. hyalina in
previous studies) overwintered in Lake Constance and
did not invest in sexual reproduction, while D. galeata
produced dormant eggs and disappeared from the water
column in winter [18]. This was also reflected in MLG
variation (based on two allozyme loci) being lower in
overwintering D. longispina than in D. galeata [18].
The fact that two coexisting Daphnia taxa in Lake
Constance differed in their overwintering strategy within
a single lake suggests that this life history trait has a
genetic component. Although the conspecific Tatra
Mountain populations analysed here showed a similar
genetic structure, this is not necessarily a consequence
of genetic relatedness. The patterns of mitochondrial
variation suggest that each of these species colonised
the Tatra Mountains multiple times, and in only two of
the studied lakes from the West Tatras, Dolné Roháčské
and Vyšné Jamnícke, did they likely originate from the
same source [24,27]. This pattern is well reflected in the
Factorial Correspondence Analysis plot (Figure 2), in
which individuals from these lakes are most similar.
Furthermore, the overwintering strategy of D. galeata
tends to be similar despite the fact that some important
selection factors, such as predation pressure, strongly
differ among the lakes. In two of them (Morskie Oko
and Štrbské Lake), fish predation on Daphnia is high
[24,29], while there are no fish in the third studied lake
(Nižné Žabie Bielovodské).
The strategy of daphnids in the Tatra Mountain lakes
is most likely directly influenced by the size and depth
of lakes. In this mountain range, D. galeata inhabits several relatively large and deep lakes, while D. longispina is
found in smaller ones [24]. In deeper lakes, the likelihood of successful overwintering of Daphnia individuals
is higher, as they may survive in the deep refuge [25]. In
addition, investing into dormant eggs is much less efficient, as ephippia that sink to deep parts of the lakes are
much less likely to hatch [28]. The studied D. galeata
populations from the Tatra Mountains apparently regularly overwinter, as observed in previous studies (Table
1). In fact, investment in sexual reproduction and ephippia production seems to be absent or extremely low in
the deep lake Morskie Oko, where no ephippia-bearing
females or males were observed during an intensive
one-year study of this population [29].
Apparently, prolonged clonal reproduction is highly
advantageous for D. galeata populations in the studied
lakes. Gliwicz et al. [29] even suggested that Morskie
Oko Daphnia are obligately asexual. Indeed, a higher
frequency of obligate parthenogenetic Daphnia has been
observed at high altitudes [e.g., [2,30]], and populations
identified as D. pulicaria inhabiting alpine lakes in the
Tatra Mountains are strictly asexual [31]. Interestingly,

Hamrová et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:231
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/231

even asexual lineages coexisting in a single lake may differ in overwintering strategy [29]. However, we consider
it unlikely that D. galeata populations in the Tatra
Mountains are obligate parthenogens, in the sense that
they produce dormant eggs parthenogenetically (see [2]
for an overview). To our knowledge, this reproduction
mode has never been convincingly shown in the D. longispina complex, and it is unlikely that it would have
arisen at least twice independently in the Tatra Mountain lakes that were likely colonized by D. galeata from
different sources [24,27]. It seems rather that local D.
galeata populations remain in the parthenogenetic life
cycle phase only, and have stopped investing in sexual
reproduction altogether.
Moreover, we observed reduced levels of clonal diversity in the D. galeata population from Štrbské Lake, a
locality in which the Daphnia history in recent decades
is relatively well known. Štrbské Lake was colonized by
D. galeata in the second half of the 20 th century, and
subsequently gradually replaced the resident population
of D. longispina [24,32]. From this locality, we have
direct evidence for the production of ephippia in D.
galeata, as well-preserved dormant eggs of this species
extracted from various sediment layers from this lake
were analysed genetically [32]. Interestingly, D. longispina also could be found in Štrbské Lake in winter at
the beginning of the 20th century [33], which suggests
generally favourable conditions for overwintering at this
locality. Historical data also confirm that D. galeata was
already present in Morskie Oko a century ago [24,33]. It
is possible that the higher clonal diversity observed in
D. galeata from Štrbské Lake is due to the much
younger age of this population, as a result of which clonal selection has not yet eroded genetic diversity to the
same extent as in the two other populations.
Alternatively, this population may have a generally
higher tendency to recruit from dormant eggs than the
other two studied D. galeata populations, either due to
local environmental factors or due to its genetic background. In particular, it is possible that the local population was influenced by introgression from D. longispina
during the period of species replacement (see [34]), as
also suggested by the intermediate position of some
MLGs from Štrbské Lake in the Factorial Correspondence Analysis (Figure 2). However, we presume that
environmental conditions are more likely driving the
Daphnia overwintering strategy than the taxonomic
composition of the populations.
Apart from reductions of clonal diversity, another predicted consequence of prolonged clonal erosion is deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Simulation
data [6] suggest that the typical result of clonal selection
is a heterozygote excess even in the absence of any
selection advantage for heterozygotes. Indeed, we

Page 7 of 10

observed strong heterozygote excess in all three studied
D. galeata populations that survive winter as active animals, in contrast to D. longispina populations. The third
consequence of clonal erosion may be among-population differentiation [6]. This was high for both studied
species, but D. galeata did show higher differentiation
(Dest = 0.42, in comparison with 0.33 for D. longispina),
which would conform to the prediction. In this case,
however, factors other than clonal selection are probably
more important, in particular persistent founder effects
[4,35]. Patterns of mitochondrial DNA variation suggest
multiple independent colonisations of Tatra Mountain
lakes within each species [24,27], and the high amongpopulation differentiation is likely a direct consequence.
Our data show that the genetic diversity of a Daphnia
population may be strongly influenced by the choice of
reproductive strategy during unfavourable periods, and
can show greatly different patterns among populations
living in close proximity to one another, depending on
local environmental conditions. What are the benefits
and costs of an active overwintering strategy? Females
surviving under the ice are ready to start reproduction
as soon as conditions improve in spring, which is a
great advantage against genotypes hatching from dormant eggs [26]. If seasonal changes in a particular lake
are sufficiently predictable over a long period, overwintering genotypes may eventually prevail in the population if no selection force acts in a negative frequencydependent manner (e.g., microparasites; see [36]).
Furthermore, immigrating genotypes less adapted to
local conditions would be highly unlikely to establish
[37], and even if so, they would not succeed in successful interbreeding with the locally adapted clones.
In extreme cases, long-term clonal erosion may result
in the overwhelming dominance of a single clone, as
observed in two of the three studied D. galeata populations. However, if these clones invest little or nothing
into the production of dormant eggs, this may be an
evolutionary trap. Ephippia produced earlier in the
population are effectively buried in the sediment, and
re-establishment from the dormant egg bank may be
difficult (but see [38]). A low effective population size
may then prevent microevolutionary changes necessary
for adaptation to new selective forces, such as the introduction of new predators or parasites.

Conclusions
Our study demonstrates how different life history adaptations to unfavourable periods may impact the population genetic diversity in cyclical parthenogens. Two
closely related Daphnia species living in mountain lakes
differed in overwintering strategy, which influences the
length of the period of clonal erosion and frequency of
sexual reproduction. Consequently, strikingly different

Hamrová et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:231
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/231

patterns of genetic diversity were observed in populations of the two species. The use of microsatellite markers, which are variable enough to reveal true clonal
structures in cyclical parthenogen populations, revealed
that populations surviving unfavourable conditions as
active individuals may be dominated by a single clone.
Such an extreme reduction of clonal diversity due to
long-term clonal erosion may have profound impacts on
the microevolutionary potential of such populations.

Methods
There are over 250 glacier lakes in the Tatra Mountains,
but only a minority of these are inhabited by Daphnia
populations. The two studied species are locally the
commonest members of the D. longispina complex
(more details on zooplankton of the Tatra Mountain
lakes are given in [24,39]). We studied six lakes, three
inhabited by D. longispina, and three by D. galeata (Figure 1).
During winter zooplankton sampling of Vyšné Furkotské Lake, inhabited by D. longispina, no individuals
were found [40]; likely, this population survives winter
as dormant eggs encapsulated in protective ephippia in
the lake sediment. Winter zooplankton was never studied in the other two D. longispina lakes, Vyšné Jamnické and Dolné Roháčské (E. Stuchlík, pers. comm.),
but given their similarity to Vyšné Furkotské Lake
(Table 1), it is likely that their Daphnia populations are
under similar selection pressures regarding overwintering strategy. In contrast, all three D. galeata populations, which were sampled from larger and deeper lakes
with slightly lower elevation than D. longispina, have
been documented to overwinter as adult females under
the ice cover (see references in Table 1); in at least one
case, they were able to reproduce in such conditions
[29].
All studied lakes were sampled in September 2007,
close to the end of the main growing season (which is
delayed and much shorter in these alpine environments
in comparison with lowland habitats). Sampling during
this period ensured that clonal structure that might
have arisen by hatching early in the growing season
(which lasts, depending on altitude, between approx.
May/June to October) would be noticed genetically.
Samples were collected by tows of a plankton net from
the lake shore or from a rubber boat by vertical hauls
from the depth, and preserved in 96% ethanol. DNA
from individuals was extracted in 100 μl proteinase K
solution, using the protocol from [41].
Genotypes of individuals were determined by analysis
of nine microsatellite loci described previously [42],
amplified in a single multiplex reaction. PCRs of the 11
μl volume consisted of 10 μl of master-mix (2.9 μl of
primer mix: 0.4 μM Swid15, 0,3 μM Swid1, 0.05 μM

Dp512, 0.2 μM Swid10, 0.3 μM Swid14, 0.3 μM
Dgm109; 5.5 μl of MP-mix (Quiagen Multiplex PCR
Kit); 1.6 μl of water) and 1 μl of DNA extract. The PCR
cycle consisted of the following steps: initial denaturation at 95°C for 15 min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°
C for 0.5 min, annealing at 54°C for 1.5 min and elongation at 72°C for 1 min, with final elongation at 60°C for
30 min. Fragment analysis of PCR products was performed on the capillary sequencer ABI 3130 with the
Gene Scan Liz 500 size standard, and individuals were
subsequently genotyped in GeneMapper 4.0. (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Individuals differing from
dominant MLGs in D. galeata populations were carefully checked to rule out scoring errors.
Each individual was characterized by its multilocus
genotype (MLG), and the patterns of MLG similarity
were visualised by factorial correspondence analysis
(FCA) calculated in Genetix v4.03 [43]. Clonal richness
was expressed as the number of MLGs detected in the
sample divided by the total number of studied individuals in each population (MLG/N), the clonal diversity
as a complement of the maximum likelihood estimator
of Simpson’s index (1-D), calculated in the program
SPADE [44].
To compare the observed clonal structures in each
D. galeata population with those expected under the
strong influence of recruitment from dormant eggs, we
used the program HYBRIDLAB [45] to generate a randomised dataset simulating the result of sexual reproduction of analysed individuals, i.e., multilocus
genotypes of artificial hybrids (assuming independent
segregation of studied microsatellite loci). We then calculated the above-mentioned measures of clonal richness and diversity for 25 sets of 40 “artificial hybrids”
from each D. galeata population, and compared the
averaged values with those from field samples of both
Daphnia species.
Additionally, we evaluated whether rare genotypes
observed in populations dominated by a single MLG
more likely arose independently, or resulted from a
somatic mutation or methodological artefact. The software GenoType [46] was used to calculate a pairwise
distance matrix between individual multilocus genotypes
within each sample, assuming a stepwise mutation
model. The distribution of such pairwise distances may
be used to select a threshold that defines the maximum
difference between two MLGs at which they are still
assigned to the same clonal lineage [47], i.e., to neglect
differences caused by PCR artefacts, scoring errors, or
somatic mutations. We compared the distance class distribution of simulated datasets of 1000 “artificial
hybrids” (generated as above) with that observed in
D. galeata populations dominated by a single clone.

The extent of deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium, which are predicted under the scenario of
strong clonal erosion [6], were tested in the software
Hwclon [7] using Monte Carlo simulations (20 batches
of 500 permutations). As there were six repeated tests,
we applied sequential Bonferroni correction when assessing the significance of the results. Genetic differentiation among populations, based on the evaluated
microsatellite markers, was assessed by means of Dest
[48], using the SMOGD software [49].
