Multi-genome identification and characterization
of chlamydiae-specific type III secretion
substrates: the Inc proteins

Abstract
Background: Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacteria that multiply in a vacuolar compartment, the inclusion.
Several chlamydial proteins containing a bilobal hydrophobic domain are translocated by a type III secretion (TTS)
mechanism into the inclusion membrane. They form the family of Inc proteins, which is specific to this phylum.
Based on their localization, Inc proteins likely play important roles in the interactions between the microbe and the
host. In this paper we sought to identify and analyze, using bioinformatics tools, all putative Inc proteins in
published chlamydial genomes, including an environmental species.
Results: Inc proteins contain at least one bilobal hydrophobic domain made of two transmembrane helices
separated by a loop of less than 30 amino acids. Using bioinformatics tools we identified 537 putative Inc proteins
across seven chlamydial proteomes. The amino-terminal segment of the putative Inc proteins was recognized as a
functional TTS signal in 90% of the C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae sequences tested, validating the data
obtained in silico. We identified a macro domain in several putative Inc proteins, and observed that Inc proteins are
enriched in segments predicted to form coiled coils. A surprisingly large proportion of the putative Inc proteins are
not constitutively translocated to the inclusion membrane in culture conditions.
Conclusions: The Inc proteins represent 7 to 10% of each proteome and show a great degree of sequence
diversity between species. The abundance of segments with a high probability for coiled coil conformation in Inc
proteins support the hypothesis that they interact with host proteins. While the large majority of Inc proteins
possess a functional TTS signal, less than half may be constitutively translocated to the inclusion surface in some
species. This suggests the novel finding that translocation of Inc proteins may be regulated by as-yet
undetermined mechanisms.

Background
Members of the phylum Chlamydiae form a phylogenetically well-isolated group of bacteria. It includes the
family Chlamydiaceae, which are pathogenic bacteria
infecting a wide range of Vertebrates, as well as symbionts of free-living amoebae and other eukaryotic
hosts, often referred to as environmental chlamydiae [1].
The most prominent member of the phylum is Chlamydia trachomatis, an exclusively human pathogen, which
is the leading cause of preventable blindness and of
sexually transmitted diseases of bacterial origin [2,3].
The other important species for public health is

Chlamydia pneumoniae, a causative agent of pneumoniae, which has also been associated with a number of
chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis, adult-onset
asthma and Alzheimer’s disease [4]. Although not clearly
documented, a role for environmental chlamydiae in
human diseases cannot be excluded.
In addition to relatedness at the genomic level, members of the phylum share two characteristics: an obligate
intracellular lifestyle and a unique biphasic developmental cycle [5]. Infection starts with the attachment of the
infectious form of the microorganism, the elementary
body, to a eukaryotic host cell. Upon attachment, intracellular signaling events lead to the internalization of
the bacterium in a membrane-bound compartment
called an inclusion. Importantly, the remainder of the

developmental cycle takes place inside this compartment. Internalized, infectious particles differentiate
immediately to metabolically active bacteria, or reticulate bodies, which replicate in the inclusion. At the end
of the developmental cycle, the bacteria differentiate
back into elementary bodies that are released to the
extracellular space to initiate a new infectious cycle.
The inclusion membrane is a key player in the interactions between chlamydiae and the host cell. Its composition dictates the exchanges between the lumen of the
inclusion, in which the bacteria reside, and the host
cytoplasm. Microscopy studies indicate that chlamydiae
incorporate membranes from several intracellular compartments [6-9]. However, very few eukaryotic proteins
have been shown to be in the inclusion membrane. In
contrast, many different proteins of bacterial origin have
been found in this location. The first one, IncA, was isolated based on its immunogenicity, as antibodies against
this protein were abundant in sera of convalescent guinea
pigs [10]. Subsequently, homologs of IncA have been
found in all Chlamydiaceae species, and the protein was
shown to play a central role in controlling the fusion of
inclusions and the interactions between the inclusion and
intracellular compartments [11-13]. Following the discovery of IncA, other inclusion membrane proteins were
identified and designated as Inc proteins (Inclusion proteins) [14,15]. In addition to their localization to the inclusion membrane, they share a feature that became a
hallmark of the family: a large hydrophobic domain of 40
to 60 residues with hydrophilic residues in its middle, giving it a bilobal pattern on hydropathy plots. Access to genome sequences of chlamydiae revealed an abundance of
proteins with such a profile. A manual approach identified
46 C. trachomatis and 70 C. pneumoniae proteins with
one or two bilobal hydrophobic domain [16]. Antibodies
against five out of six predicted members of the Inc family
demonstrated their localization to the inclusion membrane, thus confirming their designation as Inc family
members. Three years later, based on the 13 Inc proteins
identified at the time, a second study used an in silico
approach to predict Inc proteins in the same two human
pathogens. Based on somewhat different criteria, this second list differs slightly from the first one, but confirms the
specificity of Inc proteins to Chlamydiae genomes and the
extension of the family in C. pneumoniae compared to
C. trachomatis [17]. To date, C. trachomatis is by far the
species for which the Inc catalog is best characterized,
with about twenty members [18]. Only a handful has been
characterized using specific antibodies in other species,
including very recently the environmental species Protochlamydia amoebophila (see references in Table 1).
The bilobal hydrophobic domain of Inc proteins is
predicted to enable its insertion into the inclusion membrane, although, in the absence of genetic tools to

Page 2 of 20

manipulate chlamydiae, it is difficult to demonstrate.
Furthermore, it is assumed that at least one segment of
the protein faces the cytosol of the host. This has been
demonstrated in a few cases, either directly by microinjecting antibodies into the cytoplasm, or indirectly by
identifying eukaryotic partners [19-22]. Type III secretion (TTS) signals have been found in the amino terminal domain of several Inc proteins, indicating that this
is the secretion mechanism used to transit the bacterial
outer membranes [23,24]. The precise mechanism by
which the proteins, following transit through the secretion needle, are inserted in the inclusion membrane is
unknown.
From their localization at the interface between the
bacteria and the host, Inc proteins are expected to be
involved in varied processes. However, only a few
interactions between Inc proteins and eukaryotic proteins have been described (listed with references in
Table 1), and, for the most part, their exact function
in infection is totally unknown. Genes coding for the
Inc proteins are not all expressed at the same time
during the developmental cycle [25,26], indicating that
the proteins participate in the maturation of the inclusion membrane and might be only transiently present
on the membrane, fulfilling a function limited to certain stages of development. Early comparisons of the
putative Inc proteins of C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae indicated that only a subset is conserved between
these two species [16]. For those which are conserved,
the level of similarity is usually very low, and the Inc
proteins are among the least conserved proteins when
comparing the two species. This is somewhat surprising if Inc proteins are involved in key interactions
between the bacteria and the host, which are expected
to be conserved in all Chlamydiaceae species. One partial answer to that intriguing question may come from
the observation that many of the Inc proteins are
immunogenic during C. trachomatis infection in
humans [18]. To counterbalance their exposure to the
host immune system, genes coding for Inc proteins
might be subjected to a higher rate of modification
than the rest of the genome.
Since the early manual description of putative Inc proteins in the C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae proteomes, seven different species of Chlamydiaceae have
been sequenced, including one species of an environmental chlamydiae, Protochlamydia amoebophila.
Furthermore, more than thirty putative Inc proteins
have now been validated using specific antibodies,
mostly in C. trachomatis (Table 1). We used this information to identify features characteristic of all Inc proteins, which we used in a systematic computer-based
approach to identify all putative Inc proteins in
published chlamydial genomes. Using a heterologous

secretion assay in Shigella, we observed that a large
majority of these proteins contained a functional TTS
signal. This result validated our criteria for the in silico
identification of Inc proteins. In spite of their ability to
be recognized as TTS substrates, many putative Inc proteins are not detected at the inclusion membrane during
in vitro culture, suggesting that their translocation
might be controlled by an unknown mechanism.

Results
Inc protein hydrophobic domains consist of two
transmembrane alpha helices

The hallmark of Inc proteins is a large hydrophobic
domain of 40 to 60 residues with non-hydrophobic residues in its middle, resulting in a bilobal pattern on
hydropathy plots [16]. While it is assumed that this
hydrophobic domain serves as an anchor in the inclusion

membrane, its secondary structure has not been investigated. The most common secondary structure for transmembrane segments is the alpha helix; other structures
include short buried hydrophobic helices or beta-barrels
[27]. We submitted the sequences of 31 known Inc proteins (listed in Figure 1) to Split analysis, which predicts
the secondary structure of the transmembrane domains
of membrane proteins [28]. In all cases, Split analysis predicted that Inc protein hydrophobic domains correspond
to two alpha helical transmembrane segments, ranging
from 15 to 32 residues, connected with a short loop of 3
to 22 residues.
The proximity of two helical segments suggested that
they might constitute transmembrane helical hairpins,
which consist of two closely spaced transmembrane
helices separated by a tight turn loop with charged residues in the flanking regions [29,30]. To test this hypothesis, the sequences of known Inc proteins were
submitted to Topcons, which established a consensus
prediction of membrane protein topology based on different programs and allowed us to define the limits of
the helices and of the loop [31]. Amino acids found in
the loop between the helices were then subjected to the
“turn propensity scale” of helical hairpins [30]. Residues
known as turn-forming residues were enriched in the

loop. Interestingly, helix-breaking Pro and Gly residues
were over-represented as were the polar amino acid Asn
and semi-polar Ser and Thr residues, whereas high
turn-forming charged residues Lys, Arg, Asp, Glu were
absent (Figure 1).
In conclusion, the length and composition of known
Inc proteins are compatible with the topology observed
for transmembrane domains separated by a loop [32].
Loop length was on average of 8 residues, however a
minority of Inc proteins such as IncB and IncC presented a notably longer loop (15-22 residues). Most Inc
proteins identified so far have only one transmembrane
helical hairpin, with the exception of CT147, CT288 and
CT850, which have two.
In silico identification of all putative inc genes in seven
chlamydial genomes

To systematically identify all inc genes in fully
sequenced Chlamydiae genomes we designed a biocomputational approach based on the presence, in all Inc
proteins, of at least two transmembrane domains separated by a loop region ([16-18] and this study). Because
the maximum size of the loop region of known Inc proteins is 22 amino acids (Figure 1), we set a threshold of
30 residues between the two transmembrane segments.

Number of putative Inc proteins

Chlamydiae membrane proteins were collected from all
7 chlamydial proteomes using the Polyphobius predictor
algorithm [33]. Out of the 2904 sequences obtained, we
eliminated the sequences that only contained one hydrophobic N-terminus fragment identified as a signal peptide or that contained a single transmembrane domain.
The remaining polytopic membrane proteins (1387
sequences) were submitted to the domain recognition
program rpsblast associated with the NCBI-CDD database. Proteins generating multi-domain family hits
(COG, TIGRfam), highly indicative of a conserved prokaryotic function, were removed. In addition, sequences
containing a single domain covering the whole length of
the protein were analyzed with Blast. Among those, we
retained as candidates only the proteins specific to the
chlamydial genus. Finally at this stage, only sequences
containing at least one set of transmembrane domains
separated by a loop of less than 30 amino acids were
retained. Altogether, the seven chlamydial proteomes
generated 537 sequences that fulfilled these criteria. The
number of putative Inc proteins per chlamydial species
ranges from 76 out of 2031 proteins (4%) in P. amoebophila to 107 out of 1052 proteins (10%) in C. pneumoniae (Figure 2A). The list of putative C. trachomatis and
C. pneumoniae Inc proteins are shown in Table 2 and 3,
respectively, while putative Inc proteins from other genomes are found in Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
We next studied the evolutionary relationship of the
putative Inc proteins using InParanoid/Multiparanoid
programs, which can automatically find orthology relationships between proteins in multiple proteomes [34].
From the 537 Inc-candidates sequences, 126 are
“orphan” sequences, showing no orthology relationship
with other putative Inc. Most of these orphan putative
Inc proteins are from P. amoebophila (68 sequences)
and from C. pneumoniae (36 sequences). The remaining
411 putative Inc proteins come into 109 groups of
orthologs. Interestingly, 50 and 21 of the ortholog
groups were specific of the Chlamydophila and of the
Chlamydia families, respectively (Figure 2B). This suggests that many Inc proteins might fulfill species-specific
or family-specific functions. Alternatively, and not exclusively, Inc proteins that are involved in similar functions
in distinct species might not be recognizable at the primary sequence level.
Genes coding for Inc proteins are scattered in the
genomes with a few “hot spots” that cluster several consecutive inc genes (see in Figure 2C the distribution of
C. trachomatis inc genes as an example). Transcription
of the genes in operons has been demonstrated in a few
cases [14,15]. Finally, Inc proteins have an average
length of 279 residues (median: 207, ranging from 61 to
1537 residues). Most members of the family have only
two transmembrane segments. Inc proteins with four

but the existence of Inc proteins with more than four
transmembrane segments remains to be confirmed
experimentally.

We had previously shown that three C. pneumoniae and
nine C. trachomatis Inc proteins had an amino-terminal
sequence that was recognized as a TTS signal in Shigella
flexneri, strongly suggesting that TTS is the mechanism

by which Inc proteins are exported to the inclusion surface [24,36]. This property, which is independent of the
characteristics of Inc proteins on which the biocomputing approach was based, was used to validate our
in silico results. We included in the experiment 16 of
the C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae putative Inc proteins for which we had localization data and which had
not been previously tested in the Shigella assay (Table 1
and 4). Because such data are scarce in the case of
C. pneumoniae, we also included putative Inc proteins.
Those were randomly chosen except for CPn0284 and
CPn0285, which were included because they had not
been observed on the inclusion membrane [37]. To
determine whether putative Inc proteins contained a
TTS signal we constructed chimeras between the
amino-terminal part of the putative Inc proteins and a
reporter protein, the calmodulin-dependent adenylate
cyclase (Cya). Constructs were introduced into S. flexneri strains expressing various phenotypes with respect
to type III secretion, i.e. in which secretion was constitutively turned on (ipaB mutant) or deficient (mxiD
mutant). Secretion was assayed on colonies grown on
agar plates: secreted chimera diffuse in the agar during
overnight growth of the colony, while non-secreted chimera remain associated to the bacteria. After transfer on

a nitrocellulose membrane and western blot against the
Cya reporter protein, the secreted chimera appear as a
halo around the colony, while the non secreted constructs are only visible at the spot where the colony
grew [36]. About half of the chimeras were seen to be
translocated by a TTS dependent process by this assay
(Figure 3A). All chimeras that did not show a secretion
pattern in the colony assay were tested again in liquid
culture conditions [24], which is slightly more sensitive,
to exclude the possibility that secretion occurred but
was below detection level with the secretion assay on
colonies. After subcellular fractionation of a culture of
the ipaB or mxiD strains transformed with a chimeric
construct, the presence of the chimera was assayed by
western blot in the pellet and supernatant fractions.
Seventeen out of the 23 chimera tested in this assay
were found in the supernatant when expressed in the
ipaB strain and not in the mxiD strain (Figure 3B). To
verify that the presence of the chimera in the supernatant was not due to bacterial lysis, the fractions were
also probed with an antibody against the cytosolic cyclic
AMP receptor protein (CRP). Finally, probing the membranes with an antibody against the endogenous type III
secretion substrate IpaD showed that type III secretion
was functional in each of the transformed ipaB cultures.

Therefore, absence of the chimera in the supernatant of
these cultures did not result from a general defect in
secretion but from the absence of a functional type III
secretion signal in the chimera.
Table 4 combines these results and previous work
[24,36]. Out of the 22 C. trachomatis putative Inc proteins that we tested, 19 (86%) possessed a functional
TTS signal in their amino-terminal extremity. In
C. pneumoniae, 44 putative Inc proteins were tested and
the amino-terminal sequence of 41 (93%) were recognized as TTS signals in S. flexneri. Since the C. pneumoniae candidates were chosen randomly, this number can
be extrapolated to the whole set of C. pneumoniae putative Inc proteins. It is very close to the proportion of
TTS found in C. trachomatis putative Inc proteins, suggesting that the extrapolation is valid for all Chlamydiaceae, and that, overall, 90% of the putative Inc proteins
that we identified based on their hydrophobic profile
also possess a TTS signal.
Identification of an ADP-ribose binding domain in several
putative Inc proteins

Since Inc proteins are exposed to the host cytoplasm,
we reasoned that they might present eukaryotic-like features. We used sensitive sequence analysis tools to

search for conserved domains in putative Inc proteins,
and in particular domains more abundant in eukaryotes.
Proteins containing such a domain would not have been
filtered out during the bioinformatics procedure if the
domain covered only a restricted portion of the whole
protein. Mimicry between Inc proteins and eukaryotic
domains were reported in the case of CT147, whose
overall structure resembles the early endosomal antigen1 [26], CPn0585, which shows some similarity with Rab
GTPase-interacting proteins [20], and IncA, which
mimics SNARE domains [13]. These features were only
noticed after careful sequence examination and cannot
be revealed with standard sequence comparison tools. It
is likely that primary sequence comparisons will fail to
reveal the function of most Inc proteins, thus other
methods need to be developed.
From their conservation within the Chlamydiale phylum 7 domains of unknown functions were identified in
Inc proteins: DUF562 (in association with DUF575),
DUF648, DUF687, DUF1978, DUF1389 and UPF0242.
However, since these domains are only found in Chlamydiales, their identification does not give any clue on
their putative function.
Interestingly, the only conserved domains we found
were macro domains, which we discovered in 20

Figure 3 Identification of type III secretion signals in putative Inc proteins. A. Secretion assay on colonies. The ipaB (left) or mxiD (right)
strains of S. flexneri were transformed with different Chlamydia/Cya constructs, isolated, and one colony for each construct was grown overnight
in contact with a PVDF membrane, which served the following day to reveal the localization of the reporter protein using anti-Cya antibodies.
All chimera shown in this figure carry a functional TTS assay, which allow the chimera to diffuse in a halo in the ipaB strain but not in the mxiD
strain. B. Secretion assay in liquide cultures. Exponential cultures of ipaB or mxiD strains expressing the indicated chimeras were fractionated. The
supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions were run on SDS-PAGE and western blot was performed using anti-Cya antibody. Membranes were later
probed again using anti IpaD and anti CRP antibodies, to check that there was no bacterial lysis and that TTS was functional in the ipaB strain.
These controls were systematically performed and are only shown for the first row of constructs tested. The supernatant fractions is
concentrated 25-fold compared to the pellet fraction. Note that CPn0169/Cya is detectable in the culture supernatant, but in very low
proportion relative to its very high expression level. This is unlike other secreted chimera, we therefore concluded that this protein does not
carry a functional TTS signal.

putative Inc proteins. The macro (or A1pp) domain is a
module of about 180 amino acids which binds ADPribose and ADP-ribosylated proteins [38,39] and possibly a variety of related metabolites [40]. Macro domain
proteins are found in eukaryotes, in bacteria, in archaea
and in ssRNA viruses. While absent from the list of

P. amoebophila putative Inc proteins, at least one macro
domain was found in the six lists of Chlamydiaceae
putative Inc proteins, and the motif appears to have
expanded in the Chlamydophila lineage (Table 2, 3 and
Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The presence of a macro
domain at the inclusion membrane could allow the

Dehoux et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:109
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/109

bacteria to recruit NAD+-derived metabolites or ADPribosylated proteins to the inclusion membrane to fulfill
various functions, depending on the specificity of these
bacterial macro domains. However, the presence of a
bacterial encoded macro domain at the inclusion membrane during infection remains to be confirmed by
immunolocalization data, because the only member that
has been investigated so far, CT058, was not detected at
the inclusion [18].
Secondary structure analysis of putative Inc proteins

We next analyzed the predicted secondary structure of
putative Inc proteins. Excluding the bilobal hydrophobic
domain from the calculation, 153 sequences out of 537
exhibited an alpha-helix content superior to 50%. Alpha
helix-rich regions often constitute supersecondary structures such as coiled-coils and helical bundles and are
encountered in many virulence effectors [41,42]. A very
common structure mediating protein-protein interactions is the 34 amino acid helix-turn-helix motif formed
by tetratricopeptide motif repeats (TPR) [43]. Using two
prediction programs (Coils and Marcoils), we detected a
number of alpha helix-rich Inc proteins with a high propensity to have coiled coil regions. Among those, 64
proteins in 9 ortholog groups are predicted to form
extended (> 75 residues) coiled coil domains (Table 2, 3
and Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The number of residues predicted to form coiled coils with a threshold of
50% (Marcoils) was found to be significantly enriched in
the putative C. trachomatis Inc protein population compared to non Inc proteins with at least one transmembrane segment (Student’s t-test t = 3,1, p < 0.0001)
The two programs sometimes generated different predictions, suggesting that the alpha helical structures may
present discontinuities in the heptad pattern or organize
into amphiphilic helix or solenoid superhelical structures. Indeed, most alpha-helices of more than 25 residues not predicted to form coiled coils adopt an
amphiphilic conformation. In addition, seven sequences,
all belonging to the same chlamydial specific ortholog
group, are predicted to form solenoid superhelical structures characteristics of TPR repeats.
Many C. pneumoniae putative Inc proteins are not
translocated to the inclusion in the laboratory conditions

Inc proteins were initially defined as chlamydial proteins
that localized to the inclusion membrane during infection [10,14]. Later, the presence of at least one bilobed
hydrophobic domain was identified as a feature common
to all Inc proteins [16], and it is widely accepted that
these two characteristics define the members of the
family. Did our systematic search for proteins with a
bilobed hydrophobic domain identify proteins that all
localize to the inclusion membrane? The early work by

Page 14 of 20

Bannantine et al suggested a negative answer to this
question since, out of the six putative Inc proteins
investigated using specific antibodies, one (CT484) was
associated with the bacteria but not the inclusion membrane [16]. We recently extended this observation showing that 5 additional C. trachomatis putative Inc were
only found inside the inclusion [18] (see Table 4). These
results show that the presence of a bilobed hydrophobic
domain does not guarantee translocation to the inclusion membrane, at least for C. trachomatis Inc proteins.
To know whether this result also applied to C. pneumoniae, we raised antibodies against 7 putative Inc proteins
from C. pneumoniae (CPn0169, CPn0211, CPn0230,
CPn0355, CPn0357, CPn0602 and CPn1008) as GSTtagged fusion proteins. As a control we used antibodies
against the C. pneumoniae Inc protein CPn0186. The
anti-fusion protein antibodies were used to localize the
endogenous proteins in cells infected by C. pneumoniae
for 96 hours. In contrast to the inclusion labeling
observed with anti-CPn0186 antibodies, none of the 7
sera stained the inclusion membrane (Figure 4). The
detection of endogenous antigens was removed by preabsorption with corresponding GST fusion proteins but
not heterologous GST fusion proteins, demonstrating
the specificity of the antibodies. While they did not
stain the inclusion membrane, the 7 sera labeled the
bacteria, demonstrating that the corresponding proteins
are expressed at this stage of infection, and remain bacteria-associated. We cannot exclude the possibility that
some or all of these proteins are partially exposed on
the membrane and not detected by this approach. However, we can conclude that these 7 putative Inc proteins
are not constitutively secreted. Table 4 recapitulates the
list of putative Inc proteins for these two species with
the TTS and localization data.

Discussion and Conclusions
Initially, to identify all putative Inc proteins, we started
from the IncA domain from Pfam database (PF04156),
which is derived from the multiple alignment of IncAlike sequences. This domain includes the hydrophobic
domain and an adjacent coiled coil region, which are
characteristics of IncA. When used to detect Inc proteins, this model misclassified Inc proteins sequences
which are devoid of coiled coil regions and appeared far
down in noise rank, with a non-significant Score/Evalue
(e.g. IncB-C-D-E-F-G). This indicates that the Pfam
IncA domain is too specific for a large scale genomic
analysis. Known Inc proteins contain two transmembrane alpha-helical segments separated by a loop of less
than 30 amino acids. Using this criteria and bioinformatics tools, we have searched for all putative Inc proteins in seven chlamydial proteomes and obtained 537
candidates. These results were validated experimentally

against the GST-putative Inc fusion proteins detected signals inside the inclusions, overlapping with the chlamydial organisms. In contrast,
antibodies against GST-CPn0186, a control Inc protein, showed peripheral labelling of the inclusion membrane (bottom panels). All antibody
labelings were removed by preabsorption of the antibodies with the corresponding GST fusion proteins (panels i to p), but not the unrelated
GST-fusion protein control (q to x).

for C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae, as we found that
90% of the putative Inc proteins of these species had a
TTS signal, which is a property of Inc proteins independent of their hydrophobicity profile.
Secondary structure analysis revealed that Inc proteins
are enriched in coiled-coil domains. In bacteria, coiledcoil containing proteins represent 5% of proteins, and the
majority contain only one helix of around 28 residues
[44]. Extended coiled-coil domains are rare [45] and are
enriched in type III (and type IV) secretion proteins [42].
Motor, membrane tethering, and vesicle transport proteins are the dominant eukaryote-specific long coiled-coil
proteins, suggesting that coiled-coil proteins have gained
functions in the increasingly complex processes of subcellular infrastructure maintenance and trafficking control of the eukaryotic cell [46]. Therefore, the abundance
of sequences with a high probability for coiled-coil conformation among the putative Inc proteins supports the
hypothesis that these proteins are exposed on the cytosolic side of the inclusion membrane where they may participate in controlling the interaction between the
inclusion and the cellular compartments of the host and/
or to the motion of the inclusion in the cell, as we have
previously shown in the case of IncA [13].
We have identified a TTS signal in 90% of the 66
putative Inc proteins of C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae that we have tested. This result confirms the
robustness of our secretion assay, for which we had previously demonstrated that the rate of false positive was
below 5% [36]. Approximately 10% of the 66 putative
Inc proteins tested did not have a functional TTS signal.
None of the five putative Inc proteins for which the
secretion assay gave a negative result and for which we
have localization data was detected on the inclusion
membrane, suggesting that they might correspond to
real negatives.
Three different methods have recently been made
available to predict TTS signals in the amino-terminal
part of proteins ([47,48] and http://gecco.org.chemie.
uni-frankfurt.de/T3SS_prediction/T3SS_prediction.html.
We found that 64% (38/59) C. trachomatis putative Inc
proteins were predicted to possess a TTS signal by at
least one of the three softwares, and 45% (27/59) by at
least two. Thus, although clearly successful at recognizing TTS signals, the current predicting tools have a
higher rate of false negative than our experimental
secretion assay. Conversely, 3 of the 6 proteins in which
we did not find a functional TTS were predicted to have
one by one program, again pointing to the successes and
limits of in silico detection tools for TTS signals.
The amino-terminal sequence of only about 10% of
the putative Inc proteins, for each species, was not
recognized for TTS in S. flexneri (CT192, CT484,
CT565, CPn0169, CPn0822 and CPn1008). Several

Page 16 of 20

explanations for these negative results can be proposed:
(i) these putative Inc proteins might have lost their ability to be secreted, (ii) the sequence we considered as
coding for the N-terminal segment might not correspond to the real N-terminal segment (for example
from sequencing or annotation errors), (iii) in the chimera, the N-terminal segment might not be presented
in a conformation compatible with its recognition by
the S. flexneri TTS machinery, leading to a false negative
result in our assay. Interestingly, both orthologous proteins CT565 and CPn0822 were not recognized as TTS
substrates, suggesting the TTS signal may have been
lost before speciation of the two lineages. In contrast,
CPn0602 has a functional TTS signal while the orthologous protein CT484 has none, suggesting that the ability
to be secreted was lost in the C. trachomatis lineage
only. The reverse might apply to CT850, which is
secreted, while the homologous protein CPn1008 is not.
Finally, the amino terminal part of CT192 is missing
from other C. trachomatis serovars, as well as from the
C. muridarium homolog, while the rest of the protein is
very conserved. This might reflect the absence of evolutionary pressure to keep the amino-terminal domain
compatible with TTS in this protein, suggesting that
CT192 is not a TTS substrate.
Finally, in agreement with earlier observations [16,18],
we observed that not all putative Inc proteins are
detected on the inclusion membrane using specific antibodies. Localization data are now available for 16
C. pneumoniae putative Inc proteins. Only 7 of them
(44%) were detected on the inclusion membrane (Table
4). If this number can be extrapolated to the whole genome, only about 47 out of the 107 putative C. pneumoniae Inc proteins might be exposed at the inclusion
surface in the culture model we use (HeLa cells), meaning that the expansion of putative Inc proteins coded by
C. pneumoniae genome does not necessarily correlate
with an increase in the number of bacterial proteins
exposed at the inclusion surface in this species. In comparison only 6 out of 29 (20%) C. trachomatis Inc proteins for which localization data were obtained were not
detected at the inclusion membrane. This suggests that
in this species the pool of ‘non-translocated Inc proteins’
might be smaller than in C. pneumoniae. However, the
C. trachomatis proteins analyzed were not randomly
chosen thus making the comparison difficult.
We showed that 3 out of the 6 putative C. trachomatis
Inc proteins that were only detected on the bacteria had
a functional TTS signal (in C. pneumoniae, 7 out of 9
such proteins had a functional TTS signal). Therefore,
although some of these ‘non-translocated Inc proteins’
might correspond to false positives of the biocomputing
approach, other explanations are needed to account for
the absence of detection at the inclusion membrane of

Dehoux et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:109
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/109

many putative Inc proteins. Firstly, it could be that only
a small proportion of these putative Inc proteins is
translocated and could be undetected by our method.
Alternatively, they might be secreted very early in the
developmental cycle. At early time points, it is difficult
to distinguish between the inclusion and bacterial membranes and a transient appearance at the inclusion surface would be difficult to detect. Both scenarios raise
the question of the difference between ‘poorly’ or ‘transiently’ translocated Inc proteins and other Inc proteins.
Alternatively, ‘non-translocated Inc proteins’ might correspond to former inclusion proteins that have lost their
function as such and are no longer secreted. Considering the drastic genome reduction observed in all chlamydiae, the maintenance of these genes imply that all of
these proteins must have acquired another intrabacterial
function, which makes this explanation very unlikely.
Another hypothesis is that translocation of some Inc
proteins is controlled and responds to unknown stimuli,
which are absent from the culture conditions used here.
In other bacteria, many TTS substrates are stored,
usually in complex with chaperone proteins, before
translocation by the TTS apparatus upon stimulation
[49]. In addition to their distribution in inclusion membranes, several Inc proteins were detected in purified
bacteria, indicating that the Inc proteins might be stored
to some extent before translocation [10,15]. We have
shown that Inc proteins were not soluble when
expressed in E. coli, suggesting that in chlamydiae
unknown chaperone protein(s) might assist their folding
and availability for translocation [24]. The observation
that some putative Inc proteins are mostly found at the
inclusion membrane while others are only detected in
the bacteria suggest that different pools of Inc proteins
exist, whose translocation into the inclusion membrane
responds to different cellular environment, cell types or
even hosts. Noticeably, the expansion of putative Inc
proteins in the C. pneumoniae genome compared to
C. trachomatis accounts for about one third of the difference in gene number between the two species. This
may reflect the need for C. pneumoniae to adapt to
more variable environments, consistent with the hypothesis that certain Inc proteins may only be exposed on
the surface of the inclusion in a regulated manner.

seven genomes/proteomes were obtained using the Allversus-All sequences comparison InParanoid method
and its extention MultiParanoid, which merge multiple
pairwise ortholog groups from InParanoid into multispecies ortholog groups [34,50]. Each group of orthologs
was given a number, which is reported in Tables 2, 3
and Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
Transmembrane protein were collected with the
Polyphobius program which combines transmembrane
detection and signal peptide prediction. The method
makes an optimal choice between transmembrane segments and signal peptides, and also allows constrained
and homology-enriched predictions [33]. To reduce misclassification, proteins with a single transmembrane
domain and a signal peptide were analyzed manually.
Protein domain detection were performed with
rpsblast program (Blast package v2.2.19) [51] using the
NCBI Conserved Domain Database (CDD, v2.18) [52]).
Specific searches of domains were performed with the
Hmmer package [53,54].
Multiple alignment and domain detection

Multiple sequence alignments were performed with the
PralineTM program, which optimizes the information
for each of the input sequences (predicted secondary
structure and transmembrane structure) [55].
Charge distributional analysis was performed with
SAPS [56].
Secondary structure analysis

Secondary structure prediction was performed with the
Proteus program (v2) [57]. To optimize the selection of
proteins with coiled-coil regions we used two different
approaches: firstly the Coils program [58] with windows of
28, 21 and 17 residues, and secondly the Maircoil program
[59]. We considered high coiled coil predictions when
both algorithms returned high probabilities of coiled coils.
Other alpha helical conformations were predicted respectively with Heliquest for amphiphilic conformations [60]
and TPRpred [61] for superhelical topologies as Tetratrico
Peptide Repeats, Pentratrico repeats and SEL1-like repeats.
Presence of Leucine zippers in coiled coils proteins were
performed using 2ZIP [62].
Type III secretion assays

Genomic DNA from C. pneumoniae strain TW183, C. trachomatis serovar D/UW-3/CX and C. caviae strain GPIC

was prepared from bacteria extracted from infected HeLa
cells, using the RapidPrep Micro Genomic DNA isolation
kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Chimera comprising
the 5’ part of different chlamydial genes upstream of the
gene coding for the adenylate cyclase of Bordetella pertussis were constructed by PCR as described [24]. The constructs include about 30 nucleotides upstream from the
proposed translation start sites and the first 20 to 40
codons of the chlamydial genes. The chimeric constructs
were transformed in the S. flexneri strains SF401 and
SF620, which are derivatives of M90T in which the mxiD
and ipaB genes, respectively, have been inactivated [63,64].
Secretion on liquid cultures [24] and on colonies [36] were
assayed as described previously. Antibodies against the
cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) and against IpaD were
kindly given by A. Ullmann and C. Parsot, respectively
(Institut Pasteur).
Chlamydial gene cloning, fusion protein expression and
antibody production

The ORFs encoding putative inclusion membrane
proteins from the C. pneumoniae AR39 genome
http://stdgen.lanl.gov/ were cloned into the pGEX vectors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and expressed as
fusion proteins with a glutathione-S-transferase (GST)
fused at the N-terminus of the chlamydial proteins as
previously described [65,66]. The expression of these proteins was induced by the addition of IPTG (Invitrogen)
and the fusion proteins were extracted by lysing the
bacteria via sonication in Triton X-100 lysis buffer
(1% Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF, 75 units ml-1 aprotinin,
20 mM leupeptin and 1.6 mM pepstatin). The GST fusion
proteins were purified using glutathione-conjugated
agarose beads (Pharmacia). The purified fusion proteins were used to immunize mice for producing polyclonal antisera [67]. The sera were collected and stored
at -20°C until use.
Immunofluorescence assay

Monolayers of HeLa 229 cells grown on glass coverslips
were infected with Chlamydia pneumoniae AR39 at a
m.o.i. of 0.5 in the presence of 2 μg/ml cycloheximide.
The chlamydial organisms and infection procedures
were as described elsewhere [65,68]. Ninety-six hours
after infection cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) dissolved in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton
in PBS for an additional 10 min. After washing and
blocking, the cell samples were subjected to antibody
and chemical staining. Hoechst (blue; Sigma) was used
to visualize DNA. A rabbit anti-chlamydial organism
antibody (R12AR39, raised with C. pneumoniae AR39
organisms; unpublished data) plus a goat anti-rabbit IgG
secondary antibody conjugated with Cy2 (green; Jackson
Immuno-Research Laboratories) was used to visualize

Page 18 of 20

chlamydial inclusions. The polyclonal mouse antibodies
raised against putative inclusion membrane C. pneumoniae GST fusion proteins plus a goat anti-mouse IgG
conjugated with Cy3 (red; Jackson ImmunoResearch)
were used to visualize the corresponding antigens. In
some cases, the primary antibodies were pre-absorbed
with either the corresponding or heterologous fusion
proteins immobilized onto agarose beads (Pharmacia)
prior to staining cell samples. The preabsorption
approach was carried out by incubating the antibodies
with bead-immobilized antigens overnight at 4°C followed by pelleting the beads. The remaining supernatants
were used for immunostaining. The immunofluorescence
images were acquired with an Olympus AX-70 fluorescence microscope equipped with multiple filter sets
(Olympus) as described previously [69-71]. Briefly, the
multi-colour-labelled samples were exposed under a
given filter set at a time and single color images were
acquired using a Hamamatsu digital camera. The single
color images were then superimposed with the software
SimplePCI. All images were processed using Adobe
Photoshop (Adobe Systems).
