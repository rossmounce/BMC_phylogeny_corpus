Ancestral state reconstruction reveals multiple
independent evolution of diagnostic
morphological characters in the “Higher
Oribatida” (Acari), conflicting with current
classification schemes

Abstract
Background: The use of molecular genetic data in phylogenetic systematics has revolutionized this field of
research in that several taxonomic groupings defined by traditional taxonomic approaches have been rejected by
molecular data. The taxonomic classification of the oribatid mite group Circumdehiscentiae ("Higher Oribatida”) is
largely based on morphological characters and several different classification schemes, all based upon the validity
of diagnostic morphological characters, have been proposed by various authors. The aims of this study were to
test the appropriateness of the current taxonomic classification schemes for the Circumdehiscentiae and to trace
the evolution of the main diagnostic traits (the four nymphal traits scalps, centrodorsal setae, sclerits and wrinkled
cuticle plus octotaxic system and pteromorphs both in adults) on the basis of a molecular phylogenetic hypothesis
by means of parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian approaches.
Results: The molecular phylogeny based on three nuclear markers (28S rDNA, ef-1a, hsp82) revealed considerable
discrepancies to the traditional classification of the five “circumdehiscent” subdivisions, suggesting paraphyly of the
three families Scutoverticidae, Ameronothridae, Cymbaeremaeidae and also of the genus Achipteria. Ancestral state
reconstructions of six common diagnostic characters and statistical evaluation of alternative phylogenetic
hypotheses also partially rejected the current morphology-based classification and suggested multiple convergent
evolution (both gain and loss) of some traits, after a period of rapid cladogenesis, rendering several subgroups
paraphyletic.
Conclusions: Phylogenetic studies revealed non-monophyly of three families and one genus as a result of a lack
of adequate synapomorphic morphological characters, calling for further detailed investigations in a framework of
integrative taxonomy. Character histories of six morphological traits indicate that their evolution followed a rather
complex pattern of multiple independent gains (and losses). Thus, the observed pattern largely conflicts with
current morphological classifications of the Circumdehiscentiae, suggesting that the current taxonomic
classification schemes are not appropriate, apart from a recently proposed subdivision into 24 superfamilies.

Background
Traditionally, morphological characters are the basis for
taxonomy in the animal kingdom. In phylogenetic systematics derived or apomorphic characters are the
working tools to reconstruct common ancestors which
are further used for the grouping of taxa [1,2]. This concept differs from traditional systematics in that non-phylogenetic classifications are possibly artificial and not
useful for asking evolutionary questions [3]. Henning’s
work was later popularized by the term “cladistics”
which focuses on shared derived characters (synapomorphies). With help of these characters, cladistics aims at
classifying species into monophyletic groups. Paraphyletic groups are therefore artificial and cannot be used
within phylogenetic systematics [3]. Such artificial taxa
are results of wrongly used synapomorphic characters
caused by homoplastic character evolution and may mislead phylogenetic and taxonomic interpretations. In
recent years, morphological analyses were often combined with molecular data to solve a variety of evolutionary and taxonomic problems [4-10]. This rise of
combined analyses had an important impact on the nature of systematics [11]. Across many groups of animals,
morphology-based classifications have been frequently
revised based on new molecular phylogenies by identifying previously undetected homoplastic evolution of morphological characters (e.g. in the flatworm family
Capsalidae [12], the genus Dracus [13], the lanternfly
family Fulgoridae [14], or in Brazilian worm lizards
[15]). Thus, after more than 250 years of predominance
of comparative morphology in species discovery and
taxonomic classification, future systematic and taxonomic research will, despite some skepticism [16], utilize
combined evidence from both molecular and classical
taxonomic approaches to enhance our understanding of
biological systematics and to serve as basis for answering important questions in evolutionary biology research
[11,17].
Traditionally, acarologists have used synapomorphic
characters to classify mite species. However, based on
this traditional taxonomic approach, phylogenetic relationships among many acarine taxa have remained
unclear. Even the monophyly of the Acari is a matter of
discussion [18], with two most recent studies providing
strong evidence for a diphyly of the Acari [19,20]. Also
within the two main lineages Anactinotrichida (= Opilioacariformes + Parasitiformes) and Actinotrichida (=
Acariformes), some major classificatory changes have
been made to reflect current concepts (see [21]). In
Actionotrichida for example, recent studies based on
either morphological, gland chemical or genetic data
strongly indicate that the Astigmata represent a derived
monophyletic group within the Oribatida [19,22,23],

thus rendering the Oribatida paraphyletic. This case
highlights the necessity of combining several analytic
approaches to get insights into acarine systematics. Such
comprehensive studies combining molecular genetic and
morphological data are rare and the few examples are
mainly addressing phylogenetic questions on family or
genus level [10,24-26]. The phylogenetic relationships
within the Oribatida are unclear, some studies solely
based on molecular data addressed the phylogeography
and/or phylogeny of selected taxa only [19,27-30] and
very little emphasis has been put on characterizing the
evolution of particular traits in a phylogenetic framework. Just one recent study [31] tested whether three
particular traits, including two morphological characters,
correlate with arboreal life-style in oribatid mites.
This study is the first one to combine morphological
and molecular genetic data to elucidate the phylogenetic
relationships among the families assigned to the Circumdehiscentiae (= Brachypylina, “Higher Oribatida”),
one of the six major groups of Oribatida [32]. The Circumdehiscentiae are the largest and taxonomically richest group of Oribatida, and although several studies
aimed at resolving the taxonomy of this group, current
taxonomic classifications within the Circumdehiscentiae
are considered to be questionable [33]. Many controversial opinions regarding the use of morphological characters for diagnosing circumdehiscent taxa exist, since
these characters might be subject to homoplastic evolution, thus not necessarily reflecting the phylogenetic
relationships within the Circumdehiscentiae [34]. The
first and most cited proposal regarding the systematics
of the Circumdehiscentiae was set by Grandjean [35]
who defined five subdivisions based on three main characters: i) scalps in nymphs. A scalp is a part of the exuvia of the gastronotic region that is retained on an
emerging nymph (or adult in some genera) after the
moult. Grandjean called nymphs that retain scalps as
eupheredermous; nymphs that do not as apheredermous. In one family (Hermanniellidae) nymphs do not
retain scalps but the adults possess the tritonymphal
scalp; this characteristic is called opsiopheredermous.
One further exception concerns the Oribatellidae: here
the species are apopheredermous, with nymphs retaining
scalps which are held away from the body by setae. ii)
three pairs of centrodorsal setae da, dm and dp; if these
setae are lost in nymphs this trait is called dorsodeficient, if setae are present integridorsal. iii) the octotaxic
system in adult mites. This system is a special series of
originally four pairs of secretory [36] notogastral porose
organs (developed as porose areas or saccules) which
can vary in size, shape and number. Species featuring
the octotaxic system are called poronotic, species without it pycnonotic. Based on these three characters

SEM micrographs modified from Hunt et al. [99].

Grandjean defined the five subdivisions Opsiopheredermata, Eupheredermata, dorsodeficient Apheredermata,
normal pycnonotic (= integridorsal) Apheredermata and
Poronota. Within the Poronota Grandjean [35] formulated three groups according to the appearance of
nymphs and larvae (either wrinkled or smooth with
micro- or macrosclerits). This classification was also
adopted by Wauthy [37] who included a sixth group,
the “Circumdehiscentiae (= Pycno- and Poronota) with
wrinkled nymphs” to the Circumdehiscentiae, based on
ideas of Grandjean [35,38]. In these works, Grandjean
assumes that eleven families, including taxa of Eu- and
Apheredermata which have nymphs with a wrinkled
gastronotic cuticle structure form a monophyletic entity.
The phylogenetic relationships among the six subdivisions based on a parsimony analysis of 14 morphological
characters are shown in Fig. 1 (modified from Wauthy
[37]). Please note that Wauthy’s results have never been
formally published, but since this study represents the
only available cladistic analysis of the Circumdehiscentiae based on morphological characters, we decided to

adopt his classification scheme for our analyses. Recent
hypotheses mostly avoid Grandjean’s old classification
scheme. For example, Subías [39] simply classified the
Circumdehiscentiae into two groups, the “Pycno- and
Poronoticae” and Norton and Behan-Pelletier [34] presented a system without any higher grouping of the
taxa, but assigning the circumdehiscent taxa to 24
superfamilies.
To evaluate which of these classifications is the most
appropriate one for the Circumdehiscentiae, we inferred
a molecular phylogeny and traced several diagnostic
morphological characters on the phylogeny. Following
Grandjean’s [35] classification, we investigated the three
main traits (scalps, centrodorsal setae, octotaxic system)
plus three additional characters which are also commonly used for categorization: the presence of microand macrosclerits in nymphs, the wrinkled cuticle structure of nymphs, and furthermore the development of
so-called pteromorphs in adults. Pteromorphs are humeral projections on the lateral border of the notogaster,
concealing all or parts of the adducted legs. In some

Schäffer et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:246
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/246

taxa these are immotile structures, whereas in other taxa
the base of pteromorphs is de-sclerotized, forming a linear hinge, and inserted with a highly differentiated musculature, allowing for motility of this structure. This
trait is known from many poronotic mites and might
potentially serve as synapmorphic character within this
group.
The aims of the present study are i) evaluating the
validity of Grandjean’s [35] and Wauthy’s [37] taxonomic classification of the Circumdehiscentiae; ii) tracing the evolution of five diagnostic traits (nymphal
scalps, centrodorsal setae, sclerits and wrinkled cuticle
plus octotaxic system in adults) commonly used for
taxonomic classification of circumdehiscent mites; and
iii) investigating the potential of pteromorphs for categorization within the Poronota. To achieve our goals,
we established a molecular phylogeny based on three
nuclear markers, 28S ribosomal DNA, elongation factor1alpha (ef-1a) and heat shock protein 82 (hsp82), that
are commonly used for phylogenetic studies in arthropods [40-44] and in particular for phylogenetic inference
in mites, especially in Oribatida [26,27,29,45-47], and
traced the evolution of our six morphological traits of
interest over the molecular phylogeny using parsimony,
likelihood and Bayesian approaches.

Methods
Sample collection

This study includes 40 representatives of all five subdivisions of Circumdehiscentiae (after Grandjean [35]):
Opsiopheredermata, Eupheredermata, dorsodeficient and
pycnonotic Apheredermata and Poronota (Table 1).
Families categorized as the sixth subdivision “Circumdehiscentiae with wrinkled nymphs” (after Wauthy [37])
are written in bold lettering in the table. Based on
Weigmann [48] we chose Hermannia gibba (Hermanniidae), a member of the Desmonomata, sister group of
the Circumdehiscentiae, as outgroup. Sequences not
generated in the framework of this study were obtained
from GenBank (see Table 1).
Specimens were extracted from mosses, lichens or soil
samples with Berlese-Tullgren funnels and preserved in
absolute ethanol. Total genomic DNA was extracted
from single individuals applying the CTAB (hexadecyltriethylammonium bromide) method described in Schäffer et al. [30]. After DNA extraction, the sclerotized
body remnants were mounted on permanent slides and
used for species identification using the criteria defined
in Weigmann [33].
PCR and DNA sequencing

Fragments of 28S rDNA, ef-1a and hsp82 genes were
amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the
following primers: D3A and D3B [49] for the D3

Page 4 of 17

fragment of the 28S rDNA, 40.71F and 52.RC [50] and
EF-SyFwd and EF-SyRev [10] for ef-1a, hsp1.2 and hsp8.
x [42] for hsp82. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), purification of PCR products and DNA sequencing followed
the protocol described in Schäffer et al. [51]. DNA fragments were purified with Sephadex™ G-50 (Amersham
Biosciences) following the manufacturer’s instruction
and sequencing reaction products were analyzed on an
ABI PRISM 3130xl automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Sequences are available from GenBank under
the accession numbers listed in Table 1.
Alignment and phylogenetic analyses

We sequenced 311-329 bp of the D3 region of the 28S
rDNA, 475 bp of the ef-1a, and 467-503 bp of the
hsp82 gene in 34 specimens (from Liacarus cf. subterraneus and Arthrodamaeus sp. the fragment of hsp82
could not be amplified). Sequences were verified by
comparisons with known oribatid sequences from GenBank and aligned by eye in MEGA 3.1 [52]. We
removed poorly aligned regions from the alignments of
28S rDNA and hsp82 using the program trimAl [53]
which is a tool for automated alignment trimming. Gap
threshold was set to 0.8 and similarity threshold to
0.001. All sequences were combined into a single data
set with a resulting length of 1,298 bp for further
analyses.
Phylogenetic inference was based on Bayesian inference (BI), conducted in MrBayes 3.1.2 [54]. Data were
partitioned by gene and the ef-1a gene was further partitioned by codon position. Number of substitution
types was set to six (GTR model) for each data partition
and among-site rate variation was drawn from a gamma
distribution. Posterior probabilities were obtained from
a Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation (2 independent runs; 4 chains with two million
generations each; trees sampled every 100 generations),
with parameters estimated from the data set. Mixing
and convergence to stationary distributions were evaluated in Tracer v.1.4 by inspecting graphically the trace
of the parameter against the generation numbers [55].
The first 4000 (20%) trees were discarded as burn-in
prior to constructing a 50% majority-rule consensus
from the remaining 16,001 trees.
Analyses of character evolution

Ancestral state reconstruction (ASR) is an increasingly
popular method to map morphological or ecological
traits onto a molecular phylogeny. However, there are
still controversial opinions about the accuracy of commonly used methods (maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML), Bayesian) and each suffers from
certain advantages and limitations [56-59]. According to
Ekman et al. [60], who showed the importance of

Families written in bold lettering are assigned to the subdivision “Circumdehiscentiae with wrinkled nymphs” after [23]. a = Sequences obtained from GenBank.
Morphological characters and character coding used in this study: sca, scalps (0 = outgroup, 1 = opsiopheredermous, 2 = eupheredermous, 3 = apheredermous);
cd, centrodorsal setae (0 = holotrich, 1 = integridorsal, 2 = dorsodeficient); os, octotaxic system (0 = no porose organs, 1 = porose areas, 2 = saccules type1, 3 =
saccules type2); scl, sclerits (0 = nymphs nude, 1 = nymphs with microsclerits, 2 = nymphs with macrosclerits); gc, gastronotic cuticle of nymphs (0 = unwrinkled,
1 = wrinkled); pt, pteromorphs (0 = no pt, 1 = pt immotile, 2 = pt motile).

conducting ASR with more than one method, we performed our analyses using all three above mentioned
methods. Furthermore, specifying the right models and
priors in a Bayesian analysis is of uttermost importance
[60,61]. We employed the reversible-jump (RJ) MCMC,
where models are visited in proportion to their posterior
probability [62].
We traced the evolution of six morphological characters (scalps, centrodorsal setae, sclerits and wrinkled
cuticle which are all developed in nymphs plus octotaxic
system and pteromorphs both in adults; Table 1) over
the molecular phylogeny using MP, ML and Bayesian
approaches. Information on the studied characters was
retrieved from the literature [33,35,51,63-71] and from
the body remnants of our specimens. Ancestral character state reconstruction for the notogastral octotaxic system, employed two different data sets, one (titled porose
organs-1) with porose organs (regardless of which type)
as either absent (0) or present (1) and one (titled porose
organs-2) coded with the different types found in oribatid mites: porose organs absent (0), porose areas (1),
saccules type1 (2), saccules type2 (3). With reference to
Alberti et al [36] saccules type2 differs from type1 by
lacking an elaborate microvilli system, having a considerable number of mitochondria and rather characteristic

lysosome-like inclusions. Parsimony and likelihood
based ASR were conducted in Mesquite v.2.71 [72]. To
account for topological uncertainty we used the “trace
character over trees” option, which summarizes the ASR
over a series of trees. All reconstructions were integrated over the last 6001 post burn-in trees of the Bayesian analysis and the ancestral states were summarized
on the BI consensus tree. As model of evolution for the
ML reconstructions we employed the Markov k-state 1
(Mk1) parameter model, with equal probability for any
particular character change. To account for phylogenetic
mapping uncertainty, we further evaluated probabilities
of ancestral states calculated from the same 6001 BI
trees using the MCMC method in BayesMultiState [73],
implemented in the BayesTraits 1.0 package. Ancestral
states were only reconstructed for 23 nodes (see Fig. 2),
which were selected based on their posterior probability
support values of the BI analysis (only those nodes with
PP ≥ 0.95 were used). A reversible-jump (RJ) hyperprior
with a gamma prior (exponential prior seeded from a
uniform distribution on the interval 0 to 30) was used
to reduce uncertainty and arbitrariness of choosing
priors in the MCMC analysis. According to preliminary
analyses, we set the ratedev value to 8, achieving an
acceptance rate of proposed changes between 20 and

40%. The option “AddNode” was used to find the proportion of the likelihood associated with each of the
possible states at each node. Three independent MCMC
runs were performed with 5,050,000 iterations. Chains
were sampled every 100 iteration after a burn-in of
50,000 iterations. Because of similar results of the three
runs, we only report one of them here. The output files
were analyzed using Tracer v1.4.
Testing alternative hypothesis of character evolution

Bayes factors (BF) are statistical tools to compare alternative hypotheses against a null hypothesis [74-76]. We
used BF to test ten alternative phylogenetic hypotheses
against the unconstrained BI tree: Monophyly of i)
Apheredermata (hypothesis 1), ii) the dorsodeficient
nymphs (hypothesis 2), iii) Poronota (hypothesis 3), iv)
nymphs with macrosclerits (hypothesis 4), v) “Circumdehiscentiae with wrinkled nymphs” (hypothesis 5), and vi)
pteromorphs (hypothesis 6). Furthermore, we tested the
monophyly of the families Scutoverticidae (hypothesis
7), Cymbaeremaeidae (hypothesis 8) and Ameronothridae (hypothesis 9), plus monophyly of each of the three
families (hypothesis 10). Alternative phylogenetic trees
were inferred in MrBayes by applying topological constraints. Run settings were the same as for the unconstrained BI tree. We combined the two log-files of the
Bayesian analysis with the program LogCombiner v1.5.4
available in BEAST package [77] and calculated the BF
in Tracer. Standard errors were assessed using 1,000
bootstrap replicates. Interpretation of BF followed Kass
and Raftery [76].

Results
Phylogenetic analysis

Pairwise sequence divergence (uncorrected p-distances)
between the investigated species ranged from 0-11% in
the D3 fragment of 28S rDNA, from 0-22% in the ef-1a
gene and from 2-26% in the hsp82 gene. In the combined data set, pairwise differences ranged from 1-20%.
The Bayesian 50% majority rule consensus tree is
shown in Fig. 2. Most basal nodes were statistically well
supported whereas some more recent splits were poorly
resolved. Compared to the traditional classification, our
BI tree revealed some discrepancies. None of the five or
six, respectively, major subdivisions seems to be monophyletic. In particular, the “Eupheredermata”, “dorsodeficient Apheredermata” and “Poronota” appeared as paraor polyphyletic. Wauthy’s [37] subdivision “Circumdehiscentiae with wrinkled nymphs” clusters together in a
major clade, but also includes three species of Poronota
(Trichoribates trimaculatus, Euzetes globulus and
Galumna cf. obvia), though with low statistical support.
The two “circumdehiscent” species Cymbaeremaeus
cymba and Ametroproctus lamellatus form a well

Page 7 of 17

supported more basal clade, rendering the “Circumdehiscentiae with wrinkled nymphs” paraphyletic. Likewise,
the family Scutoverticidae was not resolved as monophylum, but rather constitutes two distinct clusters: one
includes exclusively species of the genus Scutovertex,
whereas the other one comprises members of the three
other genera - Provertex kuehnelti, Lamellovertex caelatus, Exochocepheus hungaricus - plus “Scutovertex pictus“ and furthermore Ameronothrus maculatus and
Scapheremaeus cf. palustris, thus rendering the family
paraphyletic. BF of the tested alternative hypothesis
rejected a monophyletic family Scutoverticidae (hypothesis 7, Table 2). The aforementioned results also imply
paraphyly of the families Cymbaeremaeidae and Ameronothridae supported by the BF which decisively discriminated against a monophyly of the two families
(hypotheses 8 and 9, Table 2). Also the monophyly of
each of the three families was rejected by the BF
(hypothesis 10, Table 2). Moreover, Achipteria coleoptrata clusters with Parachipteria punctata and Achipteria quadridentata as sister taxon, also rendering the
genus Achipteria paraphyletic; alternatively, Parachipteria might represent a synonym of Achipteria.
Ancestral state reconstruction

The results from the ASR of scalps, centrodorsal setae,
porose organs, sclerits in nymphs, nymphal cuticle
structure and pteromorphs are shown in Figs. 3, 4 and
Table 3. The reconstruction yielded no conflicts
between parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian analyses
except for some nodes, depending on the studied character (Table 3), but the likelihood approach reconstructed them with greater uncertainty (equivocal) than
the Bayesian approach. For example, nodes 4 and 5 in
scalp evolution (Fig. 3A) or node 17 in data set porose
organs-1 (Fig. 3C) were ambiguously reconstructed in
the likelihood analysis as compared to the Bayesian analysis (Table 3). On the other hand, the likelihood analysis reconstructed some nodes with greater certainty for
a particular character state than the Bayesian approach,
as for example nodes 1 and 3 in scalp evolution (Fig.
3A, Table 3) or node 20 in the reconstruction of gastronotic cuticle structure evolution (Fig. 4B, Table 3).
The reconstruction of character evolution of the nymphal scalps (Fig. 3A) and centrodorsal setae (Fig. 3B)
revealed a more or less single origin of the different
character states, with the exceptions of the two apheredermous species Ceratoppia quadridentata and Liacarus
cf. subterraneus, which clustered together with eupheredermous species, and the eupheredermous Arthrodamaeus sp., which grouped with apheredermous species.
The phylogenetic placement of the latter species implies
that dorsodeficient nymphs evolved twice. BF of alternative hypotheses reject both the monophyly of

Apheredermata (hypothesis 1, Table 2) and a monophyletic origin of dorsodeficient nymphs (hypothesis 2,
Table 2). The two-state data set of the porose octotaxic
organs revealed multiple evolution of this character (Fig.
3C). This agrees with the ASR of the second data set
(Fig. 3D; coded with the different types of porose
organs) in which porose areas, saccules type1 and 2 do
not share one most recent common ancestor (MRCA).
More precisely, saccules type2 evolved two times and
porose areas also at least twice. Particular types of porose organs are typically restricted to one phylogenetic
lineage, but with some exceptions. In one family (Achipteriidae), two different types of porose organs are present. Whereas species of the genus Achipteria possess
porose areas, the genus Parachipteria has saccules
type1, which has been proposed to be the derived form
[78]. Results of the ASR of the octotaxic porose organs
are supported by BF comparison, which decisively
rejected a monophylum Poronota (hypothesis 3, Table
2). Ancestral state reconstructions of the development

Decisive

of sclerits in poronotic nymphs indicated multiple independent origin of this trait (Fig. 4A). With Phauloppia
cf. lucorum we only had one representative of the character state “nymphs with microsclerits”, such that we
focused specifically on species showing “nymphs with
macrosclerits”. According to the reconstruction of Mesquite (Fig. 4A), this trait could have evolved at least two
times which is supported by the BF of the tested alternative hypothesis (hypothesis 4, Table 2). The ASR of
the gastronotic cuticle structure of juveniles suggested
that wrinkles in nymphs evolved independently at least
two to maximum four times (Fig. 4B). Consistent with
this observation, BF comparison rejected the hypothesis
enforcing a monophyletic subgroup “Circumdehiscentiae
with wrinkled nymphs” (hypothesis 5, Table 2). The
results of the ASR of pteromorphs (Fig. 4C, Table 3)
indicated that this structure evolved twice within the
Apheredermata and the BF of the alternative hypothesis
strongly discriminated against a monophyletic clade of
species with pteromorphs.

Discussion
Molecular phylogeny

Bayesian inference of the phylogeny of the Circumdehiscentiae based on a combined data set of fragments of
three nuclear genes revealed a tree topology similar to
previous molecular studies [27,28], especially to the
most recent phylogeny published by Maraun et al. [31]
which is based on the 18S rDNA gene. In the latter
study the statistical support for most important nodes is
higher than in our case, but we note that taxon sampling differs slightly between Maraun et al.’s and our
study. Splits within the Apheredermata are statistically
not well supported in our phylogeny, which can be
interpreted as a strong indication for a period of rapid
cladogenesis at a certain time in the past. Comparing
the 18S tree with our results in detail revealed a different placement of Scapheremaeus cf. palustris in both
phylogenies. Whereas it is grouped with Ameronothrus
maculatus and four specimens of the family Scutoverticidae in our phylogeny, it is placed with Eremaeozetes
sp. as sister taxon to Tectocepheus velatus in the 18S
tree, but we emphasize that Maraun et al.’s [31] data set
did not include any representatives of the Scutoverticidae. Furthermore, our results show that there is no
close relationship of A. maculatus and the genus Podacarus auberti cf. occidentalis as already supposed by
Grandjean [79]. However, Weigmann and Schulte [80]
unified the seven genera of originally three families
(Ameronothridae, Podacaridae, Aquanothridae) into one
single family Ameronothridae, a system accepted by
Norton and Behan-Pelletier [34]. The placement of S. cf.
palustris and A. maculatus within the Scutoverticidae
renders not only this family but also the Cymbaeremaeidae and Ameronothridae paraphyletic. These results
could certainly be caused by a strong bias of one single
gene. However, the paraphyly of these three families is
also supported in our single gene analyses (data not
shown). The non-monophyly of Cymbaeremaeidae is
also supported by the 18S rDNA gene [31] with S.
palustris and Cymbaeremaeus cymba not clustering
together. Whether the family Scutoverticidae should be
split up or extended with additional taxa (S. cf. palustris,
A. maculatus and maybe others) remains unclear until
more species of the remaining genera and closely related
families (e.g. Ameronothridae, Passalozetidae, Licneremaeidae) are included in a comprehensive phylogenetic
study. However, our data, which are certainly not comprehensive enough to allow for a full revision of these
problematic families but are sufficient to hint at some
taxonomic inconsistencies, indicate that the family Scutoverticidae might be split up in “Scutoverticidae s.s.”,
so far including only species of Scutovertex and in “Scutoverticidae s.l.” with the remaining taxa. The

Page 13 of 17

paraphyletic resolution of Ameronothridae, Cymbaeremaeidae and the genus Achipteria appears to be the
result of a lack of adequate synapomorphic morphological characters, calling for further detailed investigations
not only on a strictly morphological basis, but also
including alternative approaches in a framework of integrative taxonomy [11].
Ancestral state reconstruction

Ancestral state reconstructions and phylogenetic
hypothesis testing indicate that none of Grandjean’s [35]
main traits is a good tool to classify the investigated
taxa. However, regarding scalps and centrodorsal setae,
the only disagreement to traditional taxonomic classifications is caused by the placement of Arthrodamaeus
sp. which clusters within the Apheredermata (Figs. 3AB), supported by BF comparison of alternative phylogenetic hypotheses (Table 2). Reconstruction of the character history of the octotaxic system in adults which is
eponymous for the Poronota clearly suggested multiple
evolution of this diagnostic character (Figs. 3C-D). The
general model of the origin of saccules proposed by
Grandjean [78,81] is that porose areas invaginated and
formed a saccule having a lumen encircled by porose
walls. Thus, porose areas in the octotaxic system would
represent the plesiomorphic character state. Concerning
the question whether the small porose areas or minute
saccules in various Licneremaeoidea (e.g. Licneremaeus,
Scutovertex) do either represent a numerical and size
regression or the plesiomorphic state of the typical octotaxic system, Norton and Alberti [82] argued that the
early evolution of porose organs started small because
they are small, even minute in some Licneremaeoidea (a
probably paraphyletic assemblage according to [82]) - e.
g. Scutoverticidae, Dendroeremaeidae [83] (in our study
called saccules type2) -, in their opinion the most earlyderived group of Poronota. According to the numerical
regression, it should be mentioned that the octotaxic
system is often reduced to one, two or three pairs of
organs. Among the Scutoverticidae, for example, no species is known to have the full complement of four pairs,
leading to the hypothesis that four pairs do not represent the ancestral state for this family. Norton and
Alberti [82] noted that the earliest homologue of the
octotaxic system might be a single pair of dermal glands
that evolved by gene-duplication or by modification of
developmental controls to four pairs. Our results of the
ancestral state reconstructions now suggested, that,
whatever character coding [either two-stated (Fig. 3C)
or organ-type specific (Fig. 3D)] is used, the octotaxic
system evolved independently many times in parallel
within the Poronota. Furthermore, there are no indications that either porose areas or saccules type2 are the

Schäffer et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:246
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/246

plesiomorphic state of the porose organs as proposed by
Grandjean [78,81] and Norton and Alberti [82], respectively. Concerning the weakly supported nodes within
the Poronota (Fig. 2), one could hypothesize that porose
areas still can be traced back to one MRCA, a hypothesis clearly rejected by our BF comparison of alternative
phylogenetic hypotheses (hypothesis 3, Table 2). Saccules type2, present in Scutovertex and Exochocepheus
hungaricus, was inferred to have evolved twice from an
ancestor lacking porose organs (Fig. 3D). These results
reject the general hypothesis that Poronota represent a
natural, monophyletic subdivision, as already supposed
by Grandjean [38]; he also stated that the presence or
absence of these organs alone is not sufficient for a
grouping into Pycno- or Poronota. A recent study [34]
avoids the terms Pycnonota and Poronota, though it differentiates between pycnonotic and poronotic taxa without implying that these represent monophyletic
groupings. Woas [84] suggested that secretory porose
organs probably represent functional adaptations, potentially leading to a multiple independent evolution of this
morphological character complex. Additionally, it must
be noted that in many poronotic families and genera
species can have various types of porose organs (see
table 1 in [82]). For example, both porose areas and saccules (type1) are found among species of Achipteriidae
(Table 1) or Trichoribates [85]. In this regard a potential
parallel or convergent evolution of the octotaxic system
should already have been a point of discussion in former
time. However, considering the complexity of these
paired organs located at the more or less same notogastral positions, it appears unlikely that these structures
evolved independently multiple times, pointing to the
need of further detailed investigations on these structures. Recently, Weigmann [86] reported on a different
formation of octotaxic organs on the left and right side
of the body of one single specimen and attributed this
phenomenon to the differential action of regulatory
genes.
In addition to the three main characters, Grandjean
[35] used the morphology of nymphs and larvae for a
classification within Circumdehiscentiae. He divided the
Poronota into three types: 1) species with wrinkled
nymphs; 2) species having nymphs with macrosclerits,
and 3) species having nymphs with microsclerits.
Furthermore, Grandjean [35,38] postulated that those
taxa with wrinkled nymphs should form a monophyletic
group regardless whether they are pycno- or poronotic
(see Background) and that they might represent an
intermediate group (he formulated it as “à cheval sur la
limite” meaning “at the frontiers”) between the pycnonotic Apheredermata and Poronota. This concerns taxa of
the following 11 families: Podacaridae, Charassobatidae,
Ameronothridae, Scutoverticidae, Tectocepheidae,

Page 14 of 17

Passalozetidae, Cymbaeremaeidae, Licneremaeidae,
Achipteriidae, Tegoribatidae and Phenopelopidae (formerly Pelopsidae). Wauthy [37] followed this proposal
and named the group “Circumdehiscentiae with
wrinkled nymphs”. However, our results revealed that
the wrinkled nymphal cuticle structure evolved (and got
lost) in parallel multiple times among Circumdehiscentiae. This clearly rejects the hypotheses of Grandjean
[35,38] and Wauthy [37] that taxa with wrinkled
nymphs are monophyletic. Ancestral state reconstructions also showed that the MRCA of Circumdehiscentiae had unwrinkled nymphs (Fig. 4B), thus rejecting the
assumption of Norton and Behan-Pelletier [34] that
wrinkles in nymphs - because of their occurrence in
apheredermous and eupheredermous taxa - seem to be
the plesiomorphic or even ancestral state in
Circumdehiscentiae.
Pteromorphs only occur (with exception to the
eupheredermous Microzetidae) in adult poronotic mites
and Travé [87] postulated that the presence or absence
of this trait might serve as differentiation criterion
within the Apheredermata, a hypothesis rejected by our
data (Fig. 4C; Table 2).
Character evolution conflicting with current classification

Our reconstruction of ancestral states within the Circumdehiscentiae shows that some previously used diagnostic characters are problematic for taxon
classification, despite previous efforts to clarify plesioand apomorphies [86,88]. These problems mainly arise
from the difficulty to evaluate missing characters as
reduced or never developed. However, specific traits
could be still of appreciable value such as the presence
of nymphal scalps or centrodorsal setae. Scalp retention
is often correlated with the nature of dehiscence [35],
which goes up after a striking process in immature
instars. If the metamorphosis fails, for example due to a
genetic defect, the molting individual would stall and
die. Furthermore, the absence of centrodorsal setae correlates with the scalps [35] because species retaining
scalps on their notogaster are dorsodeficient (have lost
setae da, dm, dp). Thus, dorsodeficient nymphs correspond to the Eupheredermata and integridorsal nymphs
to the Apheredermata, respectively. As an exception the
two dorsodeficient apheredermous families Ceratoppiidae and Liacaridae group with the Eupheredermata with
dorsodeficient nymphs, thus suggesting a possible loss
of scalps in nymphal stages and adults.
Altogether, none of Grandjean’s main traits can be
used as diagnostic character for classification of the Circumdehiscentiae, because of clear evidence for multiple
parallel evolution (and in some cases also losses) of
these traits. In the case of the octotaxic system this
could be argued with a possible correlation of secretory

Schäffer et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:246
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/246

notogastral porose organs and ecology. Norton and
Alberti [82] still noted that poronotic mites with modified porose areas (saccules, multiplications) inhabit nonsoil microhabitats (e.g. mosses and lichens on rocks or
trees) and therefore internalization may reduce waterloss through porose surface. But they finally stated that
there is no biological or ecological correlation that
would help to understand frequent convergent evolution. We hypothesize that maybe there is no correlation
of the secretory organs with the present ecology. Considering the old age of Oribatida - the crown radiation
of Apheredermata took place at the Triassic/Jurassic
boundary (c. 200 MYA) [19,89] or according to Schaefer
et al. [90] in the Permian - it might be more adequate
to search for congruent environmental conditions in the
past, when the explosive radiation within the Apheredermata took place. A monophylum “Circumdehiscentiae with wrinkled nymphs” was clearly rejected by the
results of the ancestral state reconstructions, implying
that the wrinkled nymphal cuticle structure is of little
value for classification. The potential function of these
wrinkles was already well studied by Smrž [91] for some
oribatid taxa. Thereby he recovered two different types
of wrinkling (e.g. Hermannia gibba versus Scutovertex
minutus) and a potential correlation between environmental conditions and type of wrinkling.
Typically, studies on character evolution focus on
either the potential advantages of a trait in a given
environment [92-94] or mechanisms that create novel
phenotypes [95,96]. However, Wiens et al. [97] stated
that these investigations may be necessary to elucidate
why a trait has evolved in a particular instance but not
why it has evolved multiple times. According to Wiens
et al. [97] at least two additional factors are important
in determining the number of origins, namely the biogeographic context of the selective environment and
competitive interactions. The first point means that a
trait which is adapted to a selective environment may
evolve multiple times in geographically isolated regions
with identical selective environments (e.g. [98]). We
hypothesize that this might be a possible reason for the
multiple parallel evolution of the octotaxic system and
wrinkled gastronotic cuticle structure in nymphs, but
further detailed correlation studies including more taxa
are necessary to allow for robust conclusions.

Conclusions
Ancestral state reconstructions of six diagnostic characters
revealed some conflicts to the current morphological classification within the oribatid mite group Circumdehiscentiae. Most of these presumed diagnostic, in particular the
octotaxic system (eponymous for the subdivision “Poronota”) and the wrinkled gastronotic cuticle of nymphs
(taxa having these nymphs were hypothesized to be

Page 15 of 17

monophyletic within “poronotic” mites) were inferred to
have evolved/been lost multiple times independently, subsequent to an explosive radiation of the “Higher Oribatida”
into its major lineages. One likely reason for the parallel or
convergent evolution of particular traits might be based on
the biogeographic context of the selective environment,
meaning that evolution produced similar phenotypes in
different geographically isolated habitats [97]. Elucidating
the exact (genetic) mechanisms responsible for the
observed multiple origin of particular traits and character
states remain a task for the future. In particular we want
to note that at present we cannot decide whether the
genetic basis for these traits evolved several times independently or whether this patchy distribution of traits along a
phylogeny is due to atavisms, the preservation of previously existing phenotypic features in the genome, but
not expressed in the ancestors. Regardless of the exact
mechanism responsible for the observed patterns, the
investigated traits do not reflect the phylogenetic relationships among circumdehiscent mites.
Thus, to conclude, the present study clearly shows
that the current classification schemes of the Circumdehiscentiae are inappropriate. In our opinion, the most
recent proposal by Norton and Behan-Pelletier [34] with
24 superfamilies and no higher groupings best reflects
the taxonomic situation/uncertainty within the “Higher
Oribatida”. However, for future prospects to clarify the
taxonomy of the circumdehiscent mites an integrative
approach based on various sources of evidence, including molecular data [11], and an increased taxon sampling seems necessary.
