Abstract
Background: Traditionally, most studies employing data from whole mitochondrial genomes to
diagnose relationships among the major lineages of mammals have attempted to exclude regions
that potentially complicate phylogenetic analysis. Components generally excluded are 3rd codon
positions of protein-encoding genes, the control region, rRNAs, tRNAs, and the ND6 gene
(encoded on the opposite strand). We present an approach that includes all the data, with the
exception of the control region. This approach is based on a site-specific rate model that
accommodates excessive homoplasy and that utilizes secondary structure as a reference for proper
alignment of rRNAs and tRNAs.
Results: Mitochondrial genomic data for 78 eutherian mammals, 8 metatherians, and 3
monotremes were analyzed with a Bayesian analysis and our site specific rate model. The resultant
phylogeny revealed strong support for most nodes and was highly congruent with more recent
phylogenies based on nuclear DNA sequences. In addition, many of the conflicting relationships
observed by earlier mitochondrial-based analyses were resolved without need for the exclusion of
large subsets of the data.
Conclusion: Rather than exclusion of data to minimize presumed noise associated with nonprotein encoding genes in the mitochondrial genome, our results indicate that selection of an
appropriate model that accommodates rate heterogeneity across data partitions and proper
treatment of RNA genes can result in a mitochondrial genome-based phylogeny of eutherian
mammals that is reasonably congruent with recent phylogenies derived from nuclear genes.

Background
The class Mammalia provides a classic example of an
adaptive radiation, characterized by a proliferation of lineages displaying a diverse array of ecomorphological specializations for feeding and locomotion [1]. Many
additional biological attributes (e.g., behavior, physiology), coupled with this diversity in form and function,
have allowed mammals to exploit a broad range of habi-

tats worldwide. There are approximately 135 families of
living mammals apportioned into 26 orders and two
major subclasses, Prototheria and Theria, with the former
subclass containing the order Monotremata (duck-billed
platypus and spiny-anteaters) and the latter containing
the infraclasses Metatheria (marsupials) and Eutheria
(placentals), which are subdivided into 7 and 18 orders,
respectively [2,3]. Lineage-specific rate heterogeneity in

terms of morphological diversification [4] and molecular
divergence [5-7] is a trademark of the various orders and
families of mammals, especially within the Eutheria, and
this has complicated efforts to resolve phylogenetic relationships among the higher categories of mammals.
Until relatively recently, most contributions to the "mammal tree of life," as it relates to phylogeny and classification, were made by functional morphologists and
paleontologists [2,8-10]. More recent molecular efforts
have resulted in confirmation of some previous hypotheses, the refutation of others, and the proposal of novel
arrangements [10-13].
The most severe disagreements between morphology and
molecules originated from studies based on mitochondrial genome sequences. For example, monophyly of
Rodentia (the most speciose order of mammals) is based
on a combination of dentition, skull morphology, soft
anatomy, the postcranial skeleton, and the jaw mechanism [14], and early classifications never questioned the
naturalness of this clade. Nevertheless, several early studies of nuclear genes [15-17] and mitochondrial genomes
[18-20] argued that guinea pigs and presumably their relatives (hystricognath rodents from South America and
Africa) were "not rodents," but represented a separate and
more basal eutherian lineage, apart from muroid rodents
(rats and mice). These same data challenged the monophyly of Glires, a group recognized on the basis of morphology [10,21] and containing the orders Lagomorpha
(rabbits) and Rodentia, by suggesting a sister-group relationship between lagomorphs and primates [22]. The
morphological placement of the order Xenarthra (armadillos, sloths, and anteaters) at the base of the eutherian
radiation was also challenged, with mitochondrial data
suggesting either the Erinaecidae [hedgehogs; [23]] or
rodents at the base. In contrast to the morphology, xenarthrans were considered sister to a clade containing the
orders Carnivora, Perrisodactyla (horses, rhinos, and elephants), Artiodactyla (pigs, antelope, deer, camels, etc.),
and Cetacea (whales and dolphins) [24]. Two of the more
startling results from the analysis of mitochondrial
genomes included: 1) the placement the order
Monotremata as sister to Metatheria, thus making the subclass Theria paraphyletic [25], and 2) a sister-group relationship between the anthropoid primates and
Dermoptera (flying lemurs), thus rendering the order Primates paraphyletic [26]. Neither of these hypotheses is
supported from either other molecular data or morphology [9,10,27-29].
More extensive studies employing greater taxon sampling
as well as larger amounts of nucleotide sequence data
from mitochondrial RNA (primarily rRNA) and/or
nuclear genes [30-38] have resulted in higher levels of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/8

congruence with earlier morphological studies, including
increased support for a more basal position of Xenarthra,
the monophyly of Rodentia, Glires, and Primates, a
monophyletic Theria, the Paenungulata (containing elephants, hyraxes, and sirenians), Tetytheria (elephants and
sirenians), and Euarchonta (Scandentia, Dermoptera, Primates).
In contrast to recent studies employing primarily nuclear
DNA sequences, a more recent study of whole mitochondrial genomes [26] failed to retrieve many of the well-supported clades identified by nuclear gene studies. Springer
et al.'s [36] comparison of mitochondrial and nuclear
gene sequences implied that mitochondrial data are less
effective at resolving relationships at deeper nodes of the
mammalian tree, and in many cases mitochondrial
sequences failed to recover "benchmark clades," that are
well-supported by both morphology and nuclear genes.
In this particular comparison, nuclear genes apparently
outperformed mitochondrial genomes because they
evolve at a rate appropriate for resolving more divergent
relationships among major lineages of mammals.
Unless mitochondrial genomes are evolving at rates where
saturation becomes a problem at deeper nodes, one
would expect the inclusion of analytical procedures that
accommodate asymmetries observed for mtDNA [29,3942], coupled with appropriate placement of the root of
the eutherian tree [30,40,43] and increased taxon sampling [44-47], to result in mitochondrial phylogenies that
are more congruent with the consensus reached by
nuclear genes. For the most part, a consideration of these
factors has improved more recent results, primarily
because model-based analyses of more mitochondrial
genomes were employed [41]. Nevertheless, as with earlier studies employing whole mitochondrial genomes,
Reyes et al. [41] excluded several regions of the genome
prior to analysis with a model that accommodated multiple rates of substitution. For instance, 3rd codon positions,
first positions involving leucine, and the control region
are generally excluded to reduce homoplasy resulting saturation effects. The ND6 gene, encoded on the L-strand, is
omitted because of presumed differences in constraints
(e.g., base composition) relative to genes encoded on the
H-strand. Finally, ribosomal genes (rRNAs) and transfer
RNAs (tRNAs) are frequently left out, presumably because
they are difficult to align.
It is our contention that exclusion of data is unnecessary if
appropriate model-based analyses are employed. If fast
evolving sites like 3rd codon positions can be appropriately modeled, then there is little reason for excluding
them from a likelihood-based analysis. Similarly, if rRNAs
and tRNAs can be reasonably well aligned with secondary
structure, we see little justification for excluding these

characters. In this paper we provide an analysis of whole
mitochondrial genomes from 89 mammalian taxa and
investigate relationships among major lineages of eutherians. Except for the control region, which is difficult to
align across highly divergent taxa, all sequences were used
in an analysis employing a pseudoreplicate-generated,
site-specific rate model, first proposed by Kjer et al. [48].
Our major goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of this
model to negate a prior exclusion of potentially useful
data, and we base our conclusions on comparison of
results to more extensive studies based on a large panel of
nuclear gene sequences and extensive taxon sampling.

Results
The annotated Nexus file consists of 14,740 nucleotides,
includes 3,783 amino acid characters as well as additional
taxa (not used in this analysis), and is available on Kjer's
website [49]. The Nexus file on the website includes character set definitions ("charsets") that allow the user to
identify and analyze single gene partitions, codon positions, and rate classes separately, and taxon set definitions
("taxsets") that allow the user to evaluate relationships
among specific taxa. The most likely tree from the Bayesian analysis is shown in Fig. 1. This phylogeny reveals
strong support for several major groups of eutherians
including: 1) a monophyletic Afrotheria, a basal clade
containing Proboscidea (elephants), Sirenia (manatees
and dugongs), Hyracoidea (hyraxes), Macroscelidea (elephant shrews), Tubulidentata (aardvarks), Afrosoricidea
(insectivore families Chrysochloridae or golden moles
and Tenrecidae or tenrecs); 2) a monophyletic Xenarthra
sister to Afrotheria; 3) Euarchontoglires represented by
two major clades, one containing the Primates (including
Anthropoidea, Tarsiformes, and Lemuriformes), with
Dermoptera (flying lemurs) nested inside, and the other
containing a monophyletic Glires (rabbits and rodents);
4) euarchontan order Scandentia (tree shrews) sister to
the two major groups of Euarchontoglires; 5) Laurasiatheria containing a paraphyletic Eulipotyphyla (representing the insectivore families Erinaceidae and Soricidae, and
Talpidae), Chiroptera (bats), Pholidota (pangolins),
Cetartiodactyla (Artiodactyla and Cetacea or whales and
dolphins), Perrisodactyla (horses, rhinos, tapirs), and
Carnivora; 6) a sister-group relationship between Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria. In addition to these
major clades, monophyly of Paenungulata (containing
the orders Proboscidea, Sirenia, and Hyracoidea), Tethytheria (Sirenia and Proboscidea), and Cetartiodactyla
(Artiodactyla and Cetacea) with cetaceans sister to hippo
is strongly supported.
Table 1 shows the number of characters in each class, the
rescaled consistency indices (RC), the mean model
parameters and rate classes associated with the six partitions. The RC values show that the rate classes are very dif-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/8

ferent in terms of how well the data map onto the tree.
The fastest rate class is C-T rich (80%), just as C-T transitions are the fastest substitution class while slower rate
classes are much less biased in terms of nucleotide composition (Table 1). Among site rate variation is most pronounced at the slowest and the fastest rate classes. Figure
2 shows a characterization of the partitions in terms of
codon position and RNAs. RNA sequences tended to be
conservative, and in terms of rates were similar to 2nd
codon positions of protein-encoding genes. As expected,
3rd codon positions were associated with the faster rate
classes, although a portion of 3rd positions evolved slowly
(approximately 200 in rate classes 3â6). There were more
parsimony-informative RNA characters (786), as well as
first and second codon position characters (1928) in the
"fast" rate class 2, than in rate class 6 (the slowest; 197 parsimony informative rRNA sites, and 258 parsimony
informative 1st and 2nd codon sites). There were about
the same number of variable RNA characters in rate class
6 (532) as there were second codon sites (543). We note
that many 1st and 2nd codon sites are fast-evolving (2,206
in the fastest two rate classes), and 186 parsimonyinformative (of 1800) RNA characters that have been discarded from other analyses are members of the slowest
rate class, which is comparable to 131 (of 2541) parsimony-informative second codon positions in rate class 6.

Discussion
This analysis shows that third codon positions, redundant
first codon (leucine) positions, the ND6, and the RNA
genes can be included in a combined model-based analysis without drastically contradicting the general consensus
from previous molecular studies. In fact, all benchmark
clades for eutherian mammals that could be compared to
the list provided by Springer et al. [36] were retrieved in
our analysis and received high support. These benchmark
clades include (all posterior probabilities 100): 1) Carnivora (Feliformia + Caniformia); 2) Cetacea (toothed
whales and dolphins + baleen whales); 3) Cetartiodactyla
(Artiodactyla + Cetacea); 4) Chiroptera (bats); 5) Diprotodontia (wombats, wallaroos, and brush-tailed possums); 6) Paenungulata (hyrax + elephants and Sirenia);
7) Perrisodactyla (rhino and tapir + horses); 8) Rumantia
(bovines, sheep, deer); and 9) Xenarthra (armadillo +
tamandua). The mitochondrial genome-based phylogeny
shown in Fig. 1 is congruent with previous nuclear gene
studies [32-34,50] in several respects. Although placement of the root varies among studies [51], the nuclear
gene studies and our study place the groups Afrotheria
and Xenarthra at the base of the eutherian phylogeny followed by a sister-group relationship between the monophyletic groups Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria
(collectively called the Boreoeutheria). Several other
monophyletic groups appear to be well-supported and
congruent between our mtDNA and previous nuclear

"Character" refers to the number of characters in a partition. "Const." is the number of constant (invariant) sites, and "Inform" is the number of
parsimony informative sites. "RC" is the rescaled consistency index. The next six lines are the values from the rmatrix, followed by the percentages
of each of the nucleotides. "Alpha" is the shape parameter from the gamma distribution, and "m" refers to the relative rates among partitions. Rates
increase from classes 1 to 6.

DNA studies including Paenungulata (Hyracoidea, Sirenia, and Proboscidae), Cetartiodactyla (Artiodactyla and
Cetacea), Chiroptera, and Glires (Lagomorpha and
Rodentia).
Although several groups are identified by both our whole
mitochondrial genome analysis and nuclear genes, not all
of these molecularly-defined groups are necessarily congruent with morphological data. For instance, some morphological studies support a monophyletic Archonta
containing the euarchontans as well as Chiroptera [9,10],
and although a relationship between the orders Artiodactyla and Cetacea has support from morphology, a sistergroup relationship between Cetacea and the family Hippopotamidae (hippos) denoted by both nuclear genes
and mitochondrial genomes [52] is supported by some
[53] but not all morphological analyses [54,55]. Some
earlier morphological comparisons [9], but none of the
molecular data, support Volitantia, a group containing
Chiroptera and Dermoptera. More recent molecular studies, including the one presented here, have indicated paraphyly for the chiropteran suborder Microchiroptera with
the family Rhinolophidae grouping closer to the Megachiroptera, a clade containing non-echolocating taxa [56-58],
and this is not corroborated by morphological data.
Our phylogenetic results are similar to those presented by
Reyes et al. [41], which was based on a GTR+I+G Bayesian
analysis that excluded RNAs, ND6, and redundant codon
positions. Gibson et al. [39] also showed that there were
lineage and gene specific biases of C and T compositions,
and performed an analysis with a model that reduced the
character complexity of these nucleotides to Y, creating a

three-state model. While Gibson et al. [39] included
RNAs, they also excluded third codon positions and the
ND6, resulting in a dataset of 7,402 sites. While we agree
with the corrections proposed by both Gibson et al. [39]
and Reyes et al. [41] in reducing the influence of homoplastic and biased characters, our approach differed in
including a site specific rate model that rendered noisy
sites less influential at deeper nodes, while retaining them
as characters toward the tips of the tree. Our matrix is
nearly twice the size of the largest previous analyses. In
performing the pseudoreplicate reweighting, the noisiest
sites are presumably identified and accommodated in a
model. Many different partitions, including those that
were excluded by others, can be explored by downloading
the Nexus file and including specific "charsets" such as the
ND6. For example, a parsimony analysis of the ND6 gene
results in the recovery of therians, metatherians, eutherians, anthropoid primates (in the same order as the combined analysis), whales, and carnivores, among other
groups (not shown). Clearly, the ND6 contains some
non-random signal, including 26% of its 535 nucleotides
in rate class 6 (the slowest).
The trees in our analysis of the combined data differ from
others in the placement of Xenarthra; ours with Afrotheria
(Fig. 1), supporting a northern-southern hemisphere split,
and Gibson et al. [39] and Reyes et al. [41] with Euarchontoglires. Note, both this analysis and the analysis of Gibson et al. [39] compensate for the large number of
homoplastic C-T transitions but in different ways. Kriegs
et al. [59], using retrotransposed elements (which they
suppose to be "homoplasy free"), supported Xenarthra as
the sister taxon of the rest of Eutheria. While we agree that

the two retrotransposed elements supporting this relationship are exceedingly strong characters, we prefer to
consider the independent loss of these in the sloth and the
armadillo as "possible but unlikely." The rest of Kriegs et
al.'s [59] conclusions are supported by our analysis. The
placement of Manis (pangolin) also differs between this
hypothesis and Gibson et al. [39] and Reyes et al [41].
Although we show 100% posterior probability for our
hypothesis, we also note the exceedingly short branch
length of the internode placing Manis as the sister taxon to
(Cetartiodactyla(Perissodactyla(Carnivora))). Lewis et al.
[60] describe conditions under which Bayesian posterior
probabilities may be inflated, and we have not corrected
for potentially inflated support for our placement of both
Manis and Xenartha. The placement of Xenarthra with
Afrotheria and the position of Manis in our phylogenetic
hypothesis are congruent with Hudelot et al. [31], who
used a 7-state doublet model to accommodate paired
RNA sites. Similarities between this study and Hudelot et
al [31] could be attributed to the inclusion of RNAs in
both studies, while differences are more likely due to differences between models.
Finally, the mitochondrial genome data, even after inclusion of all sequences and a model that incorporates multiple rate classes, reveal several anomalies that are not
congruent with recent nuclear gene phylogenies. Some
particular anomalies appear to be inherent to all mitogenomic analyses [26,28,39,41], regardless of either taxon
sampling or the phylogenetic methods employed. Rather
than a monophyletic Primates, as revealed by nuclear
genes, our analyses as well as previous mitochondrial phylogenies indicate a paraphyletic Primates with the order
Dermoptera (flying lemurs) sister to anthropoid primates
(monkeys, lesser and great apes) to the exclusion of the
other primate lineages such as tarsiers and prosimians
(lemurs). Monophyly of the insectivore group Eulipotyphla, containing the families Erinaceidae, Soricidae, and
Talpidae, is supported by nuclear gene phylogenies [3234,61] but not by mitochondrial data, which in our case
indicates eulipotyphlan diphyly with the Erinaceidae
(hedgehogs) at the base of the Laurasiatheria clade. The
order Scandentia (tree shrews) is generally considered sister to either Dermoptera or Primates based on recent
molecular and morphological data [10,33,34,50],
whereas mitogenomic analyses place scandentians at the
base of Euarchontoglires. Additionally, mitochondrial
data support a monophyletic Tethytheria (elephants and
manatees), whereas the more recent nuclear studies [34]
do not, and although recent molecular data [62] place
marsupial moles (Notoryctes) as part of a monophyletic
group (Australidelphia) confined to Australia, our analysis places them basal to other lineages of Metatheria.

Persistent incongruence between mitochondrial and
nuclear gene phylogenies relative to the placement of
some mammalian lineages may have more than one
explanation. Long-branch attraction is often used as an
explanation for misplacement of taxa [63,64], and many
of the ambiguous placements involve lineages with longer
branches (Fig. 1). As indicated by Bergsten [63], outgroups can often influence placement of ingroup taxa,
which may be the case for the position of the marsupial
mole. Increased taxon sampling and the incorporation of
maximum likelihood models for mitogenomic analyses
[63] did remove the Erinaceidae from a basal position in
the placental phylogeny to one associated with the Laurasiatheria. Nevertheless, these modifications do not result
in a monophyletic Eulipotyphla, as suggested by nuclear
genes. In the case of the placement of Dermoptera, there
is no apparent reason to consider this as the result of
either long branches or branch support from character
partitions in the higher rate classes. Schmitz et al. [28] suggested an association between demopteran and anthropoid primate mitochondrial sequences being the result of
similarities in nucleotide and amino acid composition.
However, Hudelot et al. [31] recovered a monophyletic
primates with their doublet model, with the flying lemur
as its sister taxon, despite similarities in nucleotide composition at third positions between the flying lemur and
Anthropoidea. Finally, if these areas of incongruence are
the result of similarities in base composition, covariotide/
covarion effects, or some other source of heterogeneity
[64], it may very well be that no existing model adequately corrects for all anomalies observed for the mammalian mitochondrial genome.

Conclusion
Although some incongruence still remains between phylogenies derived from mitochondrial and nuclear
sequences, our results indicate that the exclusion of data is
not necessary for an effective reconstruction of eutherian
relationships (although we still excluded the control
region and unalignable RNA sites). Rather, selection of an
appropriate model that accommodates rate heterogeneity
across data partitions and proper treatment of RNA genes
can yield information highly congruent with more extensive nuclear sequences, even when addressing the deepest
nodes of the eutherian phylogeny. And while we are using
"expected" clades to support our conclusions, we note
that we are not using phylogenetic expectations as a
rationale to exclude data, as is often the case, but rather to
retain data. Arguments to retain data should be met with
a lower burden of proof than arguments to exclude data.

Methods
Mitochondrial genomes were downloaded from GenBank. A Nexus file was constructed, with each block in the
file corresponding to either one gene or a block of data

between 100â150 nucleotides for manually aligned
rRNAs (the number of nucleotides that are visible on one
computer screen without scrolling). Nucleotides between
genes were manually aligned, and unaligned regions were
placed between brackets (which eliminates them from the
dataset, while retaining them for visual inspection).
Ribosomal RNAs and tRNAs were aligned manually with
reference to secondary structure, according to recommendations of Kjer [65] and Gutell et al. [66]. Models for
rRNA secondary structure came from the Comparative
RNA Web (CRW) Site [67]. The control region was eliminated. All other genes and codon positions were included.
Genes coded in the reverse strand were reversed and complemented.
A site specific rate model was constructed according to
Kjer et al. [48]. Briefly, a fast heuristic bootstrap analysis,
with 1000 replicates, was completed in PAUP, having
saved one tree per replicate. The characters were then separated into 6 discrete rate classes by first selecting the
"reweight characters" option in PAUP, according to the
"best" CI from among the 1000 bootstrap-generated trees.
By selecting "view character weights," and editing the
resultant output, we constructed a file in Microsoft Excel
that was sorted according to the weights, and then reimported into the Nexus file to construct 6 partitions or
"charsets" from fastest to slowest. These charsets were
then used in a partitioned Bayesian analysis, with each
partition free to vary according to its own GTR + gamma
model.
Each Bayesian analysis was performed with 3 hot and one
cold chain. Burnin periods were graphically visualized
from the .p files from MrBayes and viewed in Excel. The
first set of two independent Bayesian analyses was run for
7.5 million generations in MrBayes 3.0 [68]. Since the
likelihood scores from these two chains were not the
same, another pair of analyses was conducted in MrBayes
3.1 [68]. This analysis was terminated with a power-failure after 5 million replicates. However, these runs had stabilized on the same likelihood plateau, which was the
same as the better of two earlier runs of 7.5 million. Therefore, after discarding the burnin, trees from all three optimal analyses were pooled into a single tree file, from
which a majority rule consensus was used to visualize posterior probability values. The best tree was visualized with
Treeview [69], and the likelihood phylogram was
exported as a pict file for modification.
