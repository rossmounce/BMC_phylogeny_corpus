Characterization of a VHS virus genotype III
isolated from rainbow trout (Oncorhychus mykiss)
at a marine site on the west coast of Norway
Henrik Duesund, Stian Nylund, Kuninori Watanabe, Karl F Ottem, Are Nylund*

Abstract
Background: Norwegian production of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) has been without any outbreaks of
VHS for many years until the disease emerged in a farm in western Norway in November 2007. The fish were, in
addition to VHS virus, positive for gill chlamydia-like bacteria, Flavobacterium psychrophilum, and a microsporidian. A
new VHS virus genotype III was isolated from the fish in RTgill-W1 cells and the complete coding region (11,065
nucleotides) was sequenced. This virus was also used in a challenge experiment to see if it could cause any
mortality in rainbow trout in sea water.
Results: This is the first time a nearly complete sequence of a genotype III virus isolate has been presented. The
organization of the genes is the same as in the other VHS virus genotypes studied (GI and GIV). Between the ORFs
are nontranslated regions that contain highly conserved sequences encompassing the polyadenylation signal for
one gene, and the putative transcription initiation site of the next gene. The intergenic regions vary in length from
74 nt to 128 nt. The nucleotide sequence is more similar to genotype I isolates compared to isolates from
genotype II and IV. Analyses of the sequences of the N and G protein genes show that this new isolate is distinct
from other VHS virus isolates and groups closely together with isolates from genotype III. In a challenge
experiment, using intraperitoneal (ip) injection of the isolate, co-habitation with infected fish, and bath challenge,
mortalities slightly above 40% were obtained. There was no significant difference in mortality between the bath
challenged group and the ip injected group, while the mortality in the co-habitation group was as low as 30%.
Conclusions: All VHS virus isolates in genotype III are from marine fish in the North East Atlantic. Unlike the other
known genotype III isolates, which are of low virulence, this new isolate is moderately virulent. It was not possible
to detect any changes in the virus genome that could explain the higher virulence. A major problem for the study
of virulence factors is the lack of information about other genotype III isolates.

Background
Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) is an
enveloped, single stranded, negative-strand RNA virus
belonging to the genus Novirhabdovirus, family Rhabdoviridae [1]. The VHS virus genome consists of approximately 11 k nucleotides and six genes encoding
nucleocapsid- (N), phospho- (P), matrix- (M), glyco(G), non-structural- (Nv) and RNA polymerase (L) protein. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the N, P, G and
Nv protein genes the VHS virus isolates have been
divided into four different genotypes; VHS virus

genotypes I, II, III and IV [2-7]. The third VHS virus
genotype (III) represents isolates from marine fish species in Kattegat, Skagerrak and the North Sea [8] and a
member of this genotype was in the autumn of 2007
associated with about 10% mortality in a rainbow trout
farm in western Norway [9,10]. VHS virus genotype III
has been found in eel (Anguilla anguilla), cod (Gadus
morhua), herring (Clupea harengus), sprat (Sprattus
sprattus), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), Norway
pout (Trisopterus esmarkii), poor cod (Trisopterus minutus), blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou), withing
(Merlangius merlangus), turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides)
and lesser argentine (Argentina sphyraena) [cf

[3,5,8,11]]. The outbreak of VHS in Norway is the first
time an isolate belonging to genotype III is found in
rainbow trout.
According to existing literature challenge of rainbow
trout with the VHS virus, genotype III, should not result
in any significant mortality [12]. However, it is to be
expected that viruses which enter into farmed populations of fish may show some virulence and possibly
cause mortality. It has been shown that VHS virus
belonging to genotype III may cause mortality when
challenging turbot [13-15] and halibut [16], which suggests that the susceptibility of the host species is also
important for the expected mortality. This has also been
observed for other viruses isolated from fish [17,18]. A
challenge experiment on rainbow trout fingerlings (10.1
grams) in fresh water, using a VHS virus isolate type III
from the same outbreak as the isolate used in this study,
has already been carried out resulting in mortality after
immersion and injections of 70% and 100%, respectively
[9]. However, this genotype III VHS virus is a purely
marine virus and experiment on fingerlings in fresh
water may not be representative for the susceptibility of
larger rainbow trout in sea water, and the resulting mortality in sea water cannot be predicted based on this
challenge experiment.
The aim of the present study is to see if this VHS
virus genotype III with the first completely characterized
coding region may cause any mortality when challenging
rainbow trout in full sea water. The genome of this isolate will be compared with partly sequenced VHS virus,
genotype III, and completely sequenced coding regions
and intergenic regions of other VHS virus, genotypes I
and IV. Such a comparison may also give clues as to
which changes in the genome may influence the virulence or ability to cause mortality in rainbow trout
populations.

between the G and NV ORFs, to 128 nt between the
NV and L ORFs. This is consistent with what has been
found for VHS virus isolates in other genotypes except
that the length of the intergenic sequences in genotype
IV isolates are slightly different. The polyadenylation
signal is also present after the ORF of the L protein (21
nt downstream), but the sequence (aga ttg aaa aaa a) is
slightly different from that found in the intergenic
regions.
Characteristics of the different protein coding genes
and their deduced ORFs are listed in table 1. When
comparing the amino acid identity of the deduced proteins of isolate FA28.11.07 (genotype III) to that of fully
or partially sequenced VHS virus isolates, all proteins
share a higher identity to the genotype I isolates than
isolates from genotypes II and IV (table 2). The only
genes sequenced from other genotype III isolates are
those coding for the G and NV proteins and these show
the highest identity to FA28.11.07. The short ORF (366
nt), located between the G and L protein, encodes the
NV protein which is the most variable protein based on
amino acid (aa) sequences. The variation is found
throughout the aa sequence, but the latter 14 aa are distinctly different in the three genotypes I, III and IV (Figure 2). Most of the variation in the nucleoprotein (N) of
VHS virus isolates, comparing genotypes I, III and IV, is
found between aa 37 - 132 and among the last 37 aa in
the peptide, avoiding the conserved RNA binding
domain suggested to be in the middle region of the protein. The aa variation in the P protein, among VHS
virus isolates, is mainly in the first third of the protein,
while there is little variation in the M protein.
Variation in aa sequence of the G protein is found
throughout the length of the protein, but with little variation in the putative transmembrane regions. The

Results
Genome of isolate FA28.11.07

The first genome of a VHS virus in genotype III, strain
FA28.11.07, containing all protein coding sequences
(CDS) and intergenic regions (ITRs), has been
sequenced (accession no: EU481506). The sequence is
11,065 nucleotides (nt) long and contains six open reading frames (ORF) in the order 3’-N-P-M-G-NV-L-5’.
This arrangement is identical to what has been found
for other, fully sequenced, VHS virus isolates in genotype I [19,20] and IV (accession no: AB490792). Between
the ORFs are nontranslated regions that include highly
conserved sequences encompassing the polyadenylation
signal for one gene, and the putative transcription initiation site of the next gene. An alignment of the conserved nontranslated sequences is shown in Figure 1.
The intergenic regions vary in length, from 74 nt

M (P-M), M and G (M-G), G and NV (G-NV), NV and L (NV-L) are
listed in message sense along with the consensus sequence. The
sequences consist of a polyadenylation signal and a putative
transcription initiation site, respectively.

proteins from other genotype III isolates. It has also
been suggested that two regions, related to fusion activity, within the G protein may play a role in determination of virulence [22]. The VHS virus isolate,
FA28.11.09, from rainbow trout in Norway shares six
out of seven amino acids, believed to be important for
determination of virulence, with the highly virulent FR07-71 strain (table 4). However, so do all other VHS
virus genotype III isolates (see accession numbers in
table 2).
Phylogeny

TMpred program http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/
TMPRED_form.html was used for prediction of transmembrane regions and orientation in the G protein of
FA28.11.09. The most strongly supported model suggested transmembrane regions between aa 1 - 18 and aa
462 - 483 where the latter has the highest support.
The last ORF (1984 aa) in the VHS virus genome is
the large (L) protein that encodes the RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase. The L protein from FA28.11.07 is
highly similar to the other L protein genes sequenced
from other VHS virus isolates, with the exception of
one isolate of genotype I, isolate FR-07-71 (Accession
nos: AJ233396 and AJ009814) from France. The conserved domains III and IV containing the four major
motifs A, B, C and D localized between aa 566 and 790
[cf [21,20]] are also present in isolate FS28.11.09. A
putative ATP biding site, with sequence GEGVRG - (20
aa) - K in position aa 1223 to aa 1249, is present in
FA28.11.07 and the genotype I isolates with the exception of isolate FR-07-71 from France. The ATP binding
site in FR-07-71 and isolates in genotype IV are
GEGVRR - (20 aa) - K and GEGIRG - (20 aa) - K,
respectively.
Ten amino acid residues that may play a role in the
determination of virulence in genotype I isolates have
been identified [19] (table 3). Compared to the genotype
I isolates, the VHS virus isolate FA28.11.09 genotype III
from rainbow trout in Norway, share 2 and 6 amino
acids with the avirulent and virulent strains, respectively.

Analyses of the relationship of the VHS virus isolate
FA28.11.07, based on nucleotides of the complete open
reading frame (ORF) of the N (1215 nt) and G (1524 nt)
proteins, show that this isolate belong to genotype III
(Figures 3 and 4). The closest relatives, based on the
ORF of the G protein, are VHS virus isolates from
Atlantic cod, Norway pout, and haddock collected in
the North sea and herring and turbot collected in Skagerrak and Ireland, respectively. The genotype, GIII,
constitutes a sister group to GI in both phylogenies.
The nucleotide sequence of the G protein from
FA28.11.07 is identical to that published (Accession no:
EU547740) by Dale et al [9]. The VHS virus from herring (CH15.02.08), collected in the mouth of Storfjorden, belongs to genogroup Ib. The rainbow trout isolate
from Norway (FA28.11.07) is the only fully sequenced
member of the GIII. The phylogeny based on the
nucleotide sequences of the ORF of the N protein
shows stronger support values compared to a similar
analysis using the G gene, however, this could be a
result of the choice of isolates and the number of isolates included in the two phylogenies.
Challenge experiment

The rainbow trout used in the challenge experiment,
came from fresh water and were put directly in full sea
water, where they suffered some mortality (8.8%) during
the acclimatization period. Most of the mortality seemed
to be due to poor smoltification, but bacteria (Vibrio
spp. and Aliivibrio spp.) were isolated from a few fish
(Accession nos: EU862328, EU862329, EU862330,
EU862331, EU862332, EU862333, EU862334) and IPN
virus was present in all of the fish. The dominating bacteria were Vibrio splendidus-like. The mortality stopped
one week before the start of the experiment. However,
the fish were still positive for IPN virus at the time of
challenge, i.e. they were carriers of the virus (Ct values
above 30). The fish remained positive for IPN virus
throughout the experimental period and a few fish were
also positive for Vibrio spp and Aliivibrio spp. All fish
tested before the start of the experiment were negative
for VHS virus.
The mortalities in the different groups varied from
2.9% in the bath control group, BK (N = 68), and up

48.4% in the i.p. challenged group, V (N = 31) (Figure
5). The mortality in the bath challenged group (BV, N =
68) was 44.1% while the mortality among the co-habitants (KV, N = 30) was 30%. The total mortality in the
tank challenged by homogenate from rainbow trout
(group H, N = 61) was 41%. The group that was challenged with homogenate from VHS virus positive herring (group CH) suffered 6.3% mortality.
Not all fish that died in the different groups were positive for presence of VHS virus. If the fish that were negative for presence of VHS virus are removed from the
mortalities the pattern of mortality remains, however,
more or less the same (Figure 6). The mortalities associated with presence of VHS virus in the V and BV were
41.9% and 44.1%, respectively. None of the fish that died

in the control group, BK, or the CH group were positive
for VHS virus. We were not able to identify any other
pathogens that could explain the mortalities of the fish
that were negative for presence of VHS virus.
None of the fish in groups V (N = 11) and KV (N =
16) were positive for VHS virus at the termination of
the experiment 53 days post challenge, while 2 and 3
fish out of 33 and 37 fish examined were positive in
groups BV and H, respectively. These five fish were carriers of VHS virus (ct values > 35) and did not show
any signs of disease. The virus was present in kidney,
heart and spleen tissues, while the brain from one fish
only was positive. Of the 97 fish sampled at the termination of the experiment 53 days post challenge 5.2% were
carriers of the VHS virus.

The FR-07-71 VHS virus isolate is highly virulent, while the mutant (07-71
mutant), Tr25 (an attenuated laboratory variant of FR-07-71), and Tr25
mutants have a low virulence. The VHS virus isolate (FA28.11.09) from rainbow
trout in Norway share six out of seven amino acids with the virulent FR-07-71
strain.

The amount of VHS virus template in the kidney and
brain of fish in the two challenge groups V and BV have
been quantified using the elongation factor alpha as a
standard. The kidney tissue from 13 individuals in
group V was positive for presence of VHS virus template while only 10 individuals had positive brain tissue
(CNS). In the BV group 28 and 27 individuals had positive kidney and CNS, respectively. Only one fish was
found to be positive for VHS virus 20 days after injection of the virus (group V), while in the bath challenged
group nine fish were positive. An individual sampled 12
days after challenge in group V had the highest expression of VHS virus genome/mRNA. This expression was
6.7 million times higher compared to the lowest expression (sampled 9 days post challenge) of these templates
in positive kidney tissue. The individual, in the V group,
with the highest expression of VHS virus template in
the CNS was sampled 7 days post challenge. None of
the fish in this group had positive CNS after 18 days
post challenge. In the bath challenged group, BV, the
highest expression of VHS virus templates in kidney tissue was found 11 days post challenge while the highest
expression in the CNS was seen 42 days post challenge.
The latter specimen had negative kidney tissue. Of the
nine fish that were positive after day 20 post challenge
five had positive kidneys and 8 had positive CNS.
VHS viruses were isolated from all challenged groups
except the control group and the CH group. Partial
sequences of the genome showed that the reisolated
viruses were identical to the FA28.11.07 isolate (Accession no: BV group: FJ362510, FJ362511, H group:
FJ362512, FJ362513, KV group: FJ362514, V group:
FJ362515).
Pathology

The weight and length of the fish in the different groups
at the termination of the challenge is given in table 5. In
all groups, including the control group (BK), some rainbow trout showed loss of scales and skin ulcers. In the

two groups that were bath challenged (groups BV and
H) a few fish had haemorrhages on the viscera (figure
7A). A few fish in all VHS virus challenged groups, V,
KV, H and BV, showed corkscrewing and had eye and
somatic muscle bleedings (figure 7B), pale gills, slight
epicarditis and some necrosis of heart myofibers in the
ventricle. The most pronounced changes were seen in
the kidneys which were slightly swollen with marked
necrosis, haemorrhages and loss of haematopoietic cells
(Figure 7C). Only minor changes were seen in the liver
of strongly positive fish (Figure 7D).
The mean haematocrit values from moribund fish
positive for VHS virus in groups V, KV and H were
about 23.0 and for those in group BV it was 12.5. In the
control group BK and the challenged group CH the
mean haematocrit values were about 55.0 in fish
sampled before day 25 after challenge, while at the termination of the experiment the values were 58.1 (N =
29) and 62.2 (N = 23), respectively. One moribund fish
in group BK, collected 32 days after start of the experiment, had a haematocrit value = eight. The haematocrit
values in all groups at the termination of the experiment
are presented in table 5.

Discussion
Genome

The complete genome of VHS virus isolates belonging
to genotypes I [19,20] and IV (accession no: AB490792)
have already been published and this study presents the
first complete sequence of the coding region of a genotype III isolate (FA28.11.07). Like all other members of
the genus Novirhabdovirus the VHS virus genotype III
has the same gene arrangement and similar intergenic
regions (ITRs) with polyadenylation signals and transcription initiation sites [19,20,23-25]. There is little variation in the length of the ITRs within the VHS virus
species, and the conserved motifs (A, B, C and D) in the
L protein [cf [20]] are the same for all VHS viruses
sequenced. The ATP binding site in FA28.11.07 is consistent with the consensus sequence for ATP binding
sites found in a number of protein kinases and in other
negative sense RNA virus polymerases [21].
The distribution of VHS virus genotype III in the
North Sea and the North Atlantic ocean has been well
documented [13,26-28]. Species like Atlantic Herring
(C. herrengus),Norway pout (T. esmarkii) and predators
of these species, like cod (G. morhua) and haddock (M.
aeglefinus) could carry the virus close to aquaculture
facilities. Virulence factors for the VHS virus have not
been identified, but it has been shown that the genetic
difference between virulent freshwater strains and
avirulent marine strains can be very small [19]. VHS
virus, like all reproducing units (based on RNA or
DNA), consists of populations individuals (virions) that

vary in genotypes and appear in a mutation-selection
balance. This natural variation will increase as a result
of mutation and mutation rates may be high in RNA
viruses. The mutation rate of VHS virus genotype III
in natural populations is, however, not known. The different variants constituting a virus population consist
of highly related virions that may have different phenotypical properties [29]. Hence, when a farmed population of rainbow trout is exposed to a population of
marine VHS viruses the variant best adapted to this

new host will dominate and may cause disease [3]. The
virus may also mutate after it has infected rainbow
trout, but there can be no replication followed by
mutations unless the virus is able to infect and multiply in rainbow trout. Hence, the VHS virus detected in
the rainbow trout farm in Storfjord must have been
“pre-adapted” to this fish species, while the VHS virus
from herring (CH15.02.08), collected in the outlet of
Storfjorden, was not able to establish an infection in
rainbow trout.

Challenge experiment

The fish used in the challenge study suffered a low mortality the first two weeks after arrival, but the mortality
ceased one week prior to the challenge. A single cause
of these mortalities was not identified, but several factors could have played a role. The fish were taken from
a fresh water site, and put directly in full seawater and
this stressful event was probably the main cause for the
mortalities. However, among the mortalities were fish
positive for bacteria and IPN virus. These agents may
have affected the mortality observed in the period before
start of the challenge and during the experimental

period. The IPN virus detected before challenge was
also present in the fish throughout the experimental
period, but at a low level (carrier state). IPN viruses are
very common in the production of salmonids in Norway
and it is not known if these virus infections may interfere with infections with VHS virus.
It has been shown in virulence studies of VHS viruses
that the challenge method is important for the resulting
mortality [12]. Using marine isolates of VHS virus they
found that immersion did not cause any mortality while
some of the same isolates caused mortality when
injected. The mechanism behind this has been studied

by Brudeseth et al [30], who found inefficiency at infecting rainbow trout to correlate with a weak ability of the
virus to translocate over polarized, primary GEC cultures and a low level of in vitro infectivity of VHS virus
isolates in primary cell cultures. The present study
shows that rainbow trout in full sea water suffers a
moderate mortality (about 40%) after exposure to the
marine VHS virus genotype III isolate, FA28.11. 07,

irrespective of challenge method (immersion or injection). However, the mortalities obtained in this study
are relatively high (regardless of infection route), compared to previous studies where rainbow trout has been
challenged with genotype III isolates of VHS virus
[12,31], but much lower than observed by Dale et al [9].
In the latter study [9] 10.1 gram rainbow trout fingerlings were challenged, using a VHS virus isolate from

the same farm as the isolate used in this study, and the
resulting mortalities were 100% and 70% after intraperitoneal injection and immersion, respectively. This is
very different from the moderate mortality seen in this
study where the mortality in the bath challenged group
(BV) was slightly higher than in the ip challenged group
(V). In the present study the conditions were full seawater and fish with a mean weight of 47.4 grams (at the
start of the experiment), hence, the conditions were as
close as possible to that in the marine farm where the

outbreak occurred and the virus was isolated. In our
opinion the use of rainbow trout fingerlings in fresh
water [9] is not a suitable system for challenge experiments using marine VHS virus isolates with the aim to
obtain knowledge about susceptibility and virulence in
marine farms. The use of fingerlings was originally
implemented for the study of VHS virus genotype Ia
which normally affects rainbow trout fingerlings in
freshwater production in Europe. The genotype Ib isolate (CH15.02.08) from herring did not result in any
mortality and the virus did not replicate in the rainbow
trout.
The fish in the V and BV group in this experiment,
were challenged with a high dose (i.p. injection TCID50
= 0.5 × 108 TCID50/fish and bath TCID50 = 0.8 × 108
TCID50/ml), which is exceedingly higher than what has
been reported by other studies infecting rainbow trout
with marine genotypes [9,12,31,32] and challenge experiments of other species [13-16,33-35]. This high dose
may have contributed to the mortality seen in this
study, however, the fish in the H group had approximately the same cumulative mortality as the BV group,

Duesund et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:19
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/19

and this fish was bath challenged in tissue homogenate
with a low amount of VHS virus. Hence, the VHS virus
isolate, FA28.11.07, seems to be more virulent for rainbow trout compared to other VHS viruses isolated from
marine fish including the isolate (CH15.02.08) from herring collected in the same area. It remains to be shown
if this isolate (FA28.11.07) is present in wild fish in western Norway or if the virus has adapted to farmed rainbow trout with a resulting increased virulence.
It has been reported that VHS survivors could become
lifetime carriers of the virus, and that they may function
as reservoirs for further transmission of the virus [36].
In this study the number of VHS virus positive fish was
few at the termination of the experiment. At day 53
only 5 out of a total of 96 survivors from all groups,
were positive for VHS virus. These five fishes all had
high Ct-values suggesting that a low amount of VHS
virus was present in the tissues. These fish that could
possibly become carriers, all belonged to the two groups
that were bath challenged. The groups challenged by i.p.
injection with cultured virus and their cohabitants
seemed to rid themselves of the virus. The fate of the
possible carrier fish was not determined. However, there
could be three possible outcomes; I) the fish will eventually develop disease and die, II) they may continue as
carriers or III) they may rid themselves of the virus. The
statement that VHS virus infections may lead to lifelong
latent infections in surviving fish, which later may infect
new hosts [36], must be considered in relation to other
studies that report limited viral recovery in surviving
fish after challenge experiments with VHS virus [15,37].
Real time RT-PCR analysis of 60 rainbow trout from the
affected farm in Storfjorden, Norway, three months after
the outbreak of disease, failed to detect VHS virus in
kidney and CNS of the fish sampled (Vidar Aspehaug,
pers com). Hence, it is a possibility that surviving rainbow trout, after a challenge with the VHS virus genotype III isolate FA28.11.07, are able rid themselves of
this virus. To confirm this it will be necessary to follow
the fish over a longer period.
Virulence

According to Gaudin et al [22] a single mutation at
position 139 (S - I/N) in the G protein was enough to
lower the virulence of mutant isolates of genotype I, and
this was further decreased by an additional mutation at
positions 140 (K - R) and 433 (I -T). A third mutation
at position 161 (K-R) resulted in the most attenuated
phenotype. Mutations at positions 118 (Q - R), 135 (T I) and 431 (L -P) also seem to lower the virulence of
type I VHS virus isolates, and Gaudin et al [22] concluded that simultaneous mutations in two distant
regions of the glycoprotein (region I aa 135 - 161 and
region II aa 431 - 433) could give maximal attenuation
of virulence. The FA28.11.07 isolate, presented in this

Page 10 of 15

study, which has an identical nucleotide sequence with
another isolate from this farm [9], shares all but one
amino acid (position 135) with the highly virulent FR07-71 isolate. At this position the FA28.11.07 isolate has
an alanine instead of the threonine found in isolate FR07-71. However, FA28.11.07 shares the same amino
acids in these positions with other marine genotype III
isolates shown to be of low virulence [12,13]. Hence,
there is no support for claiming that substitutions at
these positions affect the virulence of genotype III
isolates.
The genotype III isolate UK-860/94, from farmed turbot in Scotland, showed increased virulence for rainbow
trout after five in vivo passages in rainbow trout [38].
They were not able to detect any mutations in the
sequence of the G-protein gene, but suggested that
other genes might have been responsible for the
observed increase in virulence [38]. If they are correct
there is a possibility that a marine genotype III virus
could have been recently transmitted from a marine carrier fish to rainbow trout in aquaculture and, in a short
time, evolved increased virulence. It has been suggested
that 10 amino acid positions in four proteins (N, P, G
and L), may be virulence markers [19]. The FA28.11.07
isolate shares the majority (six) of the amino acids with
the virulent fresh water strains of genotype I isolates
and only two amino acids with the avirulent marine
strains. Hence, it can be concluded that the genotype III
VHS virus isolate FA28.11.07 shares many of the amino
acid residues with that of highly virulent fresh water
genotype I isolates. However, no information is available
about these amino acid positions in the low virulent
strains within genotype III. Considering the relatively
high mortality obtained after bath challenge in the present study, compared to similar experiments with other
marine genotype III VHS viruses, the factors influencing
virulence have yet to be identified.

Conclusions
Based on analyses of the nucleotide sequences of the
complete ORF of the N and G proteins it can be concluded that the VHS virus isolate FA28.11.07 is a new,
distinct, isolate belonging to genotype III, and being
moderately virulent to rainbow trout [cf [3-5,11,32,39]].
Only future research can show if this VHS virus isolate
from rainbow trout in Storfjorden also exits in natural
populations of marine fish in the fjord or if the isolate
represents a new adaptation to rainbow trout.
Materials and methods
In November 2007 a viral haemorrhagic septicaemia
virus (VHSV), genotype III (Accession nos: EU336985,
EU481506), was isolated from rainbow trout (Oncorhychus mykiss) suffering mortality in a marine farm in

Duesund et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:19
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/19

Storfjorden at the northern west coast of Norway [10].
The VHS virus isolate has been named FA28.11.07, and
the third passage of this isolate was used to challenge
rainbow trout in full sea water. Nearly identical VHS
virus isolates were found in two neighboring rainbow
trout farms (isolate FA28.02.08S, accession nos:
GU121099, GU121100 and isolate FA28.02.08V, Accession nos: GU121101, GU121102), and in July 2008 this
virus was also found in a more distant farm in the same
fjord. All farms are owned by the same company.
In addition to VHS virus type III, the rainbow trout in
the first farm were infected by Candidatus Piscichlamydia salmonis, an unidentified chlamydia-like species, Flavobacterium psychrophilum, and a new species of
microsporidia, Paranucleospora theridion. It is not
known to what extent these pathogens may have contributed to the mortality or to what extent the mortality
was caused by the VHS virus. However, after screening
with real time RT PCR (primers and probe described
below), only 2 out of 30 moribund rainbow trout were
found to be positive for presence of VHS virus on the
collection date 28 November 2007. The number of VHS
virus positive fish increased to 50% in the middle of
December 2007, while it was not possible to detect the
virus in kidney and brain tissues from fish (N = 60)
sampled in March 2008 (V. Aspehaug, pers. com.)
A VHS virus isolate was also obtained from herring
(Clupea harengus) collected at the outlet of Storfjorden,
but this isolate (CH18.03.08) belonged to genogroup Ib
(Accession nos: FJ384761, GU066860).
Challenge experiment

Rainbow trout, with a mean weight and length of 47.4
gram and 15.7 cm, were taken into the research facility,
Industrilaboratoriet, at the University of Bergen in January 2008. The fish came from a fresh water site in western Norway and were put directly in full sea water
(34‰). A low mortality was registered during the first
two weeks after arrival and some of the fish had skin
ulcers. Bacteria, Vibrio spp were isolated from a few of
the moribund fish during the first two weeks after arrival. However, the major loss of fish was probably due to
poor smoltification, and the mortality stopped a week
before the fish were used in the challenge experiment. A
subsample of fish (N = 40) were checked for presence of
VHS virus and IPN virus, using real time RT PCR assays
(see below), before the start of the experiment. None of
the fish that died during the acclimatization period were
positive for VHS virus, but they were all carriers of the
IPN virus and a few were positive for different bacteria
(Vibrio spp. and Moritella viscosa). The fish were kept
in 5 tanks (0.15 m3) with running sea water (34‰) at
mean temperature of 10°C.
The challenge experiment was designed to see if the
VHS virus isolate, FA28.11.07, may cause mortality and

Page 11 of 15

if different challenge methods may influence mortality.
The wild type VHS virus from herring (CH15.02.08) was
used as a control.
Tank 1

This tank was used to test the effect of intraperitoneal
injection (ip) of the VHS virus isolate FA28.11.07 and
the effect of transmission from infected to non-infected
rainbow trout (co-habitation effect). Rainbow trout, N =
31 (code = V), were injected intraperitoneal (ip) with 0.2
ml of supernatant from cell culture with TCID50 of 1.0
× 109/ml, ie. giving a final challenge dose of TCID50 =
1.1 × 106/gram fish tissue (or TCID50 = 0.5 × 108/fish).
In addition to the ip challenged fish 30 rainbow trout
(code = KV) were added as co-habitants. A total of 61
rainbow trout were kept in tank 1.
Tank 2

This tank contained 68 rainbow trout (code = BV) that
were challenged by a bath consisting of 15 ml of the
VHS virus isolate FA28.11.07 (TCID50 = 1.0 × 109 VHS
virions/ml) in 20 liter sea water for 30 minutes, i.e. at a
concentration of TCID50 = 0.8 × 106/ml.
Tank 3

This tank contained 68 rainbow trout (code = BK) that
were bathed in 15 ml cell culture media in 20 liter sea
water for 30 minutes. This group constituted the control
group for the bath challenged rainbow trout.
Tank 4

This tank was used to test if VHS virus from rainbow
trout carriers could be transmitted by bath challenge.
Rainbow trout, N = 61 (code = H), were bathed for one
hour in 20 liters of sea water added 45 ml of sterile filtered homogenate (0.2 μm) of gill and kidney tissues
from rainbow trout that were asymptomatic carriers of
VHS virus. It was not possible to culture the virus from
this homogenate. The virus was only detected by real
time RT PCR. The homogenate was obtained from carrier rainbow trout that came from the same marine
farm as the VHS virus isolate FA28.11.07.
Tank 5

This tank was used to test the possible effect on rainbow trout of a wild type VHS virus detected in herring
(CH18.03.08) from the outlet of Storfjorden. Homogenate made from brain and kidney tissue of the herring
was intraperitoneal injected into rainbow trout, N = 30
(code = CH). Each fish was injected with 0.2 ml of sterile filtered homogenate (0.2 μm).
Sampling

Dead and moribund fish were removed from the tanks
two times a day, and weight and length were registered. All fish were examined for external and internal
signs of disease. To rule out bacterial infections as a
cause of mortality, bacterial samples were taken from a
selection of dead/moribund fish and fish sampled randomly. Bacteria were isolated from kidney and grown

Duesund et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:19
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/19

on blood agar plates containing 1.5% NaCl and incubated at 15°C for at least two weeks. When growth
was observed on the agar plates the bacteria were
identified by sequencing of the 16S gene using a set of
general prokaryotic primers targeting this gene (see
below).
The following tissues were sampled from all dead/
moribund fish; gills, heart, kidney, spleen, and CNS. The
tissues were stored at -20°C before being used for reisolation of the VHS virus or RNA extraction. All dead/
moribund fish were tested for presence of VHS virus
and IPN virus by real-time RT-PCR. To obtain information about tissue tropism the head-kidney, heart, spleen
and CNS tissues were tested from 25 fish with respect
to presence of VHS virus. Based on the results from the
tissue tropism study the kidney and CNS from all fish in
the different groups were tested for VHS virus, while
only the kidneys were tested for presence of IPN virus.
A blood sample, for measuring the haematocrit, was
taken from all fish.
Several tissues (skin, gill, heart, kidney, spleen, gut and
CNS) were sampled from a few individuals in each
group and fixed in Karnovsky for examination of
histopathology.
Culturing VHS virus

RTgill-W1 cells [40] were cultured in 15 cm2 tissue culture flasks (Nunc) at 20°C in Eagles Minimum Essential
Medium (EMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 10% Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (10% v/v), L-glutamine (4 mM)
and gentamicin (50 μg/ml). The cells were then subcultured for 7-10 days until the tissue flasks were covered
with 60-80% confluent monolayer.
Supernatant containing VHS virus isolate FA28.11.08
(second passage) was diluted 1:100 in PBS and incubated for 1 hour at 15°C in cell culture flasks with the
monolayer of RTgill-W1 cells. The inoculum was then
removed and replaced by supplemented EMEM as
described above, but with 1% FBS. The cells were incubated for five days until cytopathic effect (CPE) could be
observed. RNA was extracted from infected cells and
reverse transcribed into cDNA as previously described
[41] and a real time RT PCR assay was used to test for
presence of VHS virus.
Virus titration

RT-gill W-1 cells were seeded in a 96-well tray and
allowed to form a monolayer. A 10-fold dilution series
of the VHS virus isolate was made in 2% infection medium and added to the monolayers. To each well, 200 μl
of each dilution, ranging from 101 to 1017, was added.
Each dilution was used in four parallel wells. The 96well tray was incubated for 10 days, and TCID50 (The
dilution in which 50% of the cells are dead) was determined by comparing with uninfected cells.

Page 12 of 15

Re-isolation of virus

RTgill-W1 cells were also used for reisolation of VHS
virus from the different fish groups challenged. Tissue
homogenates were made from kidney or CNS tissues
from selected fish (Codes: V, KV, BV, BK, H and CH) in
the different groups and sterile filtered (0.2 μm) before
inoculation on the cells. The cells were kept for three
passages or until a CPE could be observed. Presence of
VHS virus in cell cultures was confirmed by real time
RT PCR and sequencing of the PCR products.
Histopathology

Tissues (skin, gills, heart, head-kidney, kidney, spleen,
and brain) collected were fixed by immersion, at 6°C, in
a modified Karnovsky fixative where the distilled water
was replaced by a Ringers solution. The fixative contained 4% sucrose. Before embedding in Historesin the
tissues were dehydrated through graded series of ethanol
as recommended by the manufacturer. Semi sections,
1.5 μm thick, were cut on a Reichert-Jung 2050 microtome and stained in toluidine blue.3 Before embedding
in EMBED-812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences) the tissues were stained/post-fixed in 1% OsO4. Ultrathin sections were cut on Reichert-Jung Ultracut E. The
ultrathin sections (30 - 40 nm) were stained for 1.5
hours in 2% aqueous uranyl acetate solution and then
stained with lead citrate.
DNA/RNA extraction

The extractions of RNA from tissues were performed as
described by Devold et al. [41]. RNA-pellets were eluted
in 100 μl DEPC-water and stored at -20°C until examination by real time RT-PCR.
cDNA synthesis was performed as follows; 5 μl DEPCwater, 1 μl pd(N) 6 (random hexamers) and 4 μl RNA
template, making a total of 10 μl, was incubated at 70°C
for 5 min. A RT-mix was made from 5 μl 5 × RT-buffer
5, 1,25 μl DTT (200 mM DL-dithiothreitol), 2,5 μl 10
mM dNTP, 0,5 μl RNasin, 0,15 μl MMLV and 5,6 μl
DEPC-water, making a total volume of 15 μl. This RTmix was added to the 10 μl template/pd(N)6 mix making
a total volume of 25 μl. This solution was incubated at
37°C for 60 min [41] after which the cDNA was stored
at -20°C.
DNA was extracted from all isolated bacteria using the
DNeasy DNA Tissue kit (Qiagen) following the manufactures description of protocol. Elution was performed
twice in 50 μl 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 8.5 to increase
the overall DNA yield, and the DNA was stored at -20°
C.
PCR and sequencing

The partial G gene (654 nucleotides) from VHS virus
present in tissues of challenged rainbow trout and virus
isolated from challenged fish in cell culture, was
obtained by PCR using the cDNA synthesized as

Duesund et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:19

described above (accession nos: FJ362510, FJ362511,
FJ362512, FJ362513, FJ362514, FJ362515). VG1 (5’-ATG
GAA TGG AAC ACT TTT TTC-3’) and VD3 (5’-TGT
GAT CAT GGG TCC TGG TG-3’) were used as PCR
primers [42]. The nearly complete genome of the VHS
virus isolate FA28.11.07 was obtained by using primers
targeting the genome of other VHS virus belonging to
genotypes I and IV (The primers can be obtained from
the authors).
The partial 16S genes from isolated bacteria were
obtained by the following primers; EUGB27F and
EUGA1518R [43].
PCR products were run on electrophoresis gels for
visualization and the products were purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) as described by the
manufacturer. Sequencing was then performed in both
directions using ABI PRISM BigDye terminator chemistry (version 2) according to Applied biosystems (ABI).
The PCR primers were used for sequencing.
Real time RT-PCR

In this experiment six real time RT-PCR assays were
used (table 6). Primers and a probe able to detect both
VHS virus genotype I and III were obtained by a modification of an assay developed by Mike Snow [44]. The
assay targets a region of the nucleoprotein of VHS virus,
ie. position 194 - 302 in the ORF of the N gene (Accession no: EU481506).
The internal control assay El-1A targets the Atlantic
salmon cellular elongation factor [45]. The assays for
detection of Paranucleospora theridion, Flavobacterium
psychrophilum, Candidatus Piscichlamydia salmonis and

the new chlamydia species, targeting the genes coding
for the SSU, are presented in table 6.
Verso™ 1-step QRT-PCR ROX Kit and Absolute™
QPCR ROX Mix were used for the real time RT-PCR
assays. Analysis was performed in a ABI 7500 sequence
detection system (Applied Biosystems). The reaction
was 15 min at 50°C (Reverse Transcriptase step), 15 min
at 95°C (Polymerase activation step) followed by 45
cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds (DNA-dissociation) and
60°C for one minute (Annealing and elongation).
Efficiency and sensitivity

Prior to real-time RT PCR analysis the VHS virus assay
was optimized with regards to concentrations of primers and probe. An efficiency test was preformed to
test the efficiency of the VHS virus and elongation factor assays in order to be able to perform relative quantification of the amount of VHS virus in the samples.
This test was performed by using a tenfold dilution
series. The dilution series was made in the concentration ranging from 477.6 ng/μl to 4.776 -06 ng/μl for
VHS virus assay and 243.6 ng/μl to 2.436-06 ng/μl for
the elongation factor assay. Template used in the efficiency test was as described above. The dilution series
was analyzed in triplicates using one-step real-time RT
PCR. The mean Ct value for each triplicate was calculated and a standard curve was made by plotting Ct
values against the serial logarithmic dilutions. The
amplification efficiency (E) for the VHSV08 and EF1A
assays were calculated using the formula: (10-1/-slope)-1

To perform the sensitivity test a twofold dilution series was made from 0,4 ng/μl to 0,0625 ng/μl. 10 replicates were made from each dilution and analyzed using
one-step real time PCR. The sensitivity limit of the
VHSV08 assay was set as the highest dilution where all
10 replicates were positive. The detection limit, derived
from this sensitivity test for the VHSV08 assay, was
found to be Ct = 37.0. This implies that Ct values
higher than this limit may not be reproducible.

Relative quantification

The expression of the target VHS virus genome template was calculated using the formula for normalized
expression (NE): NE = (E reference)Ctreference/(Etarget)Ct
target, where E = amplification efficiency.
Phylogenetic analysis

The nearly complete genome of the VHS virus isolate,
FA28.11.07, from the farmed rainbow trout kept in Storfjorden western Norway, was sequenced (Accession no.
EU481506). The N and G protein genes were aligned with
homologous gene sequences from a selected number of
VHS viruses already available on the EMBL nucleotide
database, including a Norwegian isolate collected from
rainbow trout in 1968 (Accession no: AY546621). The
VHS virus (CH18.03.08) from herring (Accession nos:
FJ384761, GU066860), collected in the outlet of the fjord,
was also included in the analysis. To perform pairwise
comparisons between the different viruses, the multiple
sequence alignment editor GeneDoc (Available at: http://
www.psc.edu/biomed/genedoc) was used. Polymorphic
regions were manually aligned and compared for both
genes. Gaps in the alignment were deleted (the alignment
can be obtained from the corresponding author).
Phylogenetic analyses of the data sets were performed
using PAUP* version 4.0 [46] and TREE-PUZZLE 5.2
(Available at: http://www.tree-puzzle.de). TREE-PUZZLE
reconstructs phylogenetic trees from molecular data by
maximum likelihood, and computes maximum likelihood
distances and branch lengths. A model corresponding to
GTR+I was identified by the Akaike information criterion
using the Modeltest 3.6 script [47] in PAUP v4.0 [46], to
be suitable for the datasets. In this study 10 000 quartet
puzzling (QP) steps were carried out. The QP tree search
estimates support values for each internal branch.
Branches showing QP reliability from 90 - 100% can be
considered very strongly supported. Branches with lower
reliability (>70%) can in principle be trusted. The only
phylogeny presented in this study is the result of analysis
using the GTR matrix in TREE-PUZZLE. Phylogenetic
trees were drawn using TreeView [48].
Authors’ contributions
AN conceived the study. AN, HD and SN planned the experimental design.
AN, HD and SN carried out the challenge experiment and sampling. SN
