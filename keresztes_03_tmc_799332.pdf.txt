Abstract
Background: Mutations in the transmembrane cochlear expressed gene 1 (TMC1) cause deafness
in human and mouse. Mutations in two homologous genes, EVER1 and EVER2 increase the
susceptibility to infection with certain human papillomaviruses resulting in high risk of skin
carcinoma. Here we report that TMC1, EVER1 and EVER2 (now TMC6 and TMC8) belong to a larger
novel gene family, which is named TMC for trans membrane channel-like gene family.
Results: Using a combination of iterative database searches and reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments we assembled contigs for cDNA encoding human, murine,
puffer fish, and invertebrate TMC proteins. TMC proteins of individual species can be grouped into
three subfamilies A, B, and C. Vertebrates have eight TMC genes. The majority of murine TMC
transcripts are expressed in most organs; some transcripts, however, in particular the three
subfamily A members are rare and more restrictively expressed.
Conclusion: The eight vertebrate TMC genes are evolutionary conserved and encode proteins
that form three subfamilies. Invertebrate TMC proteins can also be categorized into these three
subfamilies. All TMC genes encode transmembrane proteins with intracellular amino- and carboxyltermini and at least eight membrane-spanning domains. We speculate that the TMC proteins
constitute a novel group of ion channels, transporters, or modifiers of such.

Background
The complete sequencing of the human genome led to the
conclusion that the number of human genes is approximately 30,000 – 40,000 [1,2]. This initial estimate was
proven to be incorrect because a comparison of the predicted genes that were identified in public and commercial sequencing projects and inclusion of a third cluster of
known genes revealed little overlap among the three
groups [3]. Although many of the discrepancies between
the different human genome assemblies are caused by
fundamental disparities in the compilation of the

sequence information [4], it is still evident that the
human genome harbors probably significantly more than
40,000 genes and that these genes are not easily identified. This is particularly true for genes that are either
expressed transiently, at low levels, or in very few specific
cell types. Such elusive genes are underrepresented in
cDNA libraries and consequently also in expressed
sequence tag (EST) databases. Computational annotation
of such genes from genomic DNA becomes additionally
challenging when the genes consist of many scattered
small exons.

Two pairs of previously un-notated genes encoding transmembrane proteins have recently been identified based
on their linkage with inherited disorders. The first set of
genes, transmembrane cochlear expressed genes 1 and 2
(TMC1) and TMC2 [5] were found in a search for mutations causing dominant and recessive deafness in human
and mouse [5,6]. Mutations in the second pair of genes,
EVER1 and EVER2, are linked to epidermodysplasia verruciformis that is associated with an increased susceptibility
to infection with some human papillomaviruses causing a
high risk of skin carcinoma [7]. We noticed that the proteins encoded by these genes are homologous, which
raised our interest in testing whether the genome accommodates additional related genes.

Results
The mammalian TMC gene and protein family
We used human TMC1 and TMC2, murine Tmc1 and
Tmc2, and human EVER1 and EVER2 sequences in conjunction with database search algorithms to identify
homologous sequences in genomic and expressed
sequence tag (EST) databases. We iteratively assembled
contiguous theoretical coding sequences for individual
human and mouse proteins. We verified regions of individual murine cDNAs that were not unequivocally predictable with database information by RT-PCR and by
sequencing. This strategy resulted in the identification of
the murine orthologues of EVER1 and EVER2, and four
hitherto uncharacterized human and mouse proteins (Figure 1, Table 1). All identified proteins have eight predicted
membrane-spanning domains (TM1 – TM8) and share
the completely conserved amino acid triplet C (cysteine)
– W (tryptophan) – E (glutamic acid), predicted to be
located in the extracellular loop upstream of TM6 (Figure
2). The presence of this hereby named TMC signature
sequence motif CWETXVGQEly(K/R)LtvXD is our defining
criterion for this novel TMC protein family (Figures 1, 2,
additional file 2).

The eight mammalian TMC proteins can be grouped into
three subfamilies A, B, and C, based on sequence homology and on similarities of the genomic structure of their
respective genes (Figures 1, 3, and 4). The murine TMC
protein subfamily A consists of three proteins, Tmc1,
Tmc2, and the novel Tmc3. All TMC subfamily A proteins
are between 757 and 1130 amino acids in length. Tmc3
bears a long carboxyl-terminal tail that is unlike all other
TMC proteins (Figure 1). The overall identity within the
TMC subfamily A is 36–56%; the positions of >73% of the
genes' introns within the conserved core region are conserved (Figure 3A, 3C, additional file 1).
The murine TMC subfamily B consists of Tmc5 and Tmc6
(mouse orthologue of EVER1), proteins of 810 and 757
amino acid residues that are 31% identical and share a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/24

>92% conservation of the corresponding genes' intron
locations within the conserved core region (Figure 3A, 3C,
additional file 1). A significant structural difference
between subfamily B and subfamily C proteins is that the
long presumptive extracellular loop of TMC subfamily A
proteins between TM5 and TM6 is much shorter in subfamily B proteins and mainly consists of the TMC signature sequence motif (Figures 1, 2).
Finally, the three members of the murine TMC subfamily
C, Tmc4, Tmc7, and Tmc8 (mouse orthologue of EVER2)
are the shortest TMC proteins with 694, 726, and 722
amino acid residues. The overall identity within the
murine TMC protein subfamily C is 29–33% with a common gene structure of >92% conserved intron locations
within the conserved core region (Figure 3A, 3C, additional file 1).
Analysis of the human TMC gene and protein family
yielded principally identical results, likely because of the
high degree of conservation between human and murine
TMC proteins [5] (Figure 4). The new TMC classification
now designates TMC6 for EVER1, and TMC8 for EVER2
(Table 1).
The TMC genes map to six chromosomal locations in the
human and mouse (Table 1). Two chromosomal locations in both species harbor two neighboring TMC genes,
Tmc5 and Tmc7 on murine chromosome 7, and Tmc6 and
Tmc8 on murine chromosome 11; the human orthologues
are located on the syntenic regions of chromosomes 16
and 17, respectively [7]. An additional murine locus on
chromosome 8 represents a partial gene fragment, likely a
pseudogene of Tmc2.
Expression of murine TMC transcripts
To demonstrate that all predicted murine TMC genes are
transcribed, we performed RT-PCR experiments. Primer
pairs specific for each TMC transcript amplified products
of predicted length and sequence (Figure 5).

Tmc1 and Tmc3 mRNAs were detectable in most neuronal
organs and we also found expression in some non-neuronal organs. Tmc2 transcripts were only detectable in testis;
we did not reveal by RT-PCR Tmc2 expression in cochlea.
However, we were able to verify that Tmc2 is expressed in
the cochlea by using an organ of Corti cDNA library as a
template for PCR, which corroborates the results presented by Kurima et al. (2002).
We observed that mRNAs encoding Tmc5, Tmc6, Tmc4
and Tmc7 are expressed in most murine organs tested.
Tmc8 mRNA is detectable in thymus and lung; we also
found expression of Tmc8 mRNA in spleen (not shown).

We did not detect Tmc8 transcripts in any other organs
investigated.
Our expression analysis results are corroborated by an
analysis of applicable TMC ESTs obtained from GenBank
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/ (Figure 5).
Non-mammalian vertebrate and invertebrate TMC genes
and proteins
The high degree of similarity between the corresponding
human and murine TMCs suggests a conserved function
of these proteins. This role of TMC proteins may also be
conserved among other species. We therefore decided to
investigate the TMC genes of other vertebrates and
invertebrates.

We identified eight TMC loci in the Japanese pufferfish
(Torafugu, Fugu rubripes, Fr) genomic database http://
fugu.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/. Whereas the genome of Fugu
rubripes is one order of magnitude shorter than the length
of the human genome, the total number of genes is estimated to be approximately the same [8,9]. Because of the

low homology of amino- and carboxyl-terminal
sequences, we were not able to determine the complete
coding sequences of the eight pufferfish TMC proteins
unequivocally; nevertheless, we obtained sufficient
sequence information of the central parts of the proteins
bearing the transmembrane domains to classify the eight
pufferfish TMCs into the three subfamilies. This subfamily
assignment of individual TMC proteins was further substantiated by an analysis of the degree of conservation of
intron positions within the Fugu rubripes TMC gene family
(Figure 3B). The Fugu rubripes genome contains three TMC
subfamilyA genes Tmc2-rs1 (Tmc2-related sequence1),
Tmc2-rs2 (Tmc2-related sequence2), Tmc3, three TMC subfamilyB genes Tmc5, Tmc6-rs1 (Tmc6-related sequence1),
Tmc6-rs2 (Tmc6-related sequence2), and two subfamilyC
genes Tmc4 and Tmc7 (Table 1). The nomenclature of the
pufferfish TMC genes and proteins is derived from the
phylogenetic relation of the corresponding sequences
with the mammalian TMCs (Figure 4). It is interesting that
the pufferfish genome lacks orthologues of mammalian
TMC1 and TMC8. Fugu rubripes Tmc5 and Tmc7 are

clustered, equivalent to the clustering of their mammalian
orthologues [7].

Drosophila melanogaster genome database revealed only a
single TMC gene, TmcAh, (Figure 4, Table 1).

TMC genes also exist in invertebrates. In GenBank, we
identified two mRNA sequences encoding Caenorhabditis
elegans (Ce) TMC proteins. These mRNAs are transcribed
from TmcAh1 (Tmc subfamily A homologue1) and TmcAh2
(Tmc subfamily A homologue2) (Table 1).

We did not find evidence for TMC genes in genomes and
cDNA databases of yeast and plants.

Whereas the C. elegans genome appears to lack TMC subfamily B and C genes, some insects have genes for all three
TMC subfamilies. For example, the mosquito Anopheles
gambiae has three TMC genes, TmcAh (Tmc subfamily A
homologue), TmcBh (Tmc subfamily B homologue), and
TmcCh (Tmc subfamily C homologue) (Figure 4, Table 1).
We did not find deposited cDNA TmcAh and TmcCh, but
TmcBh appears to be transcribed (ESTs BM645887,
BM621478, BM605758, and BM636384). A search of the

Discussion
In an effort to define a novel gene family, we set out to
identify genes related to TMC1, TMC2, EVER1, and EVER2
[5–7]. We obtained the coding sequences of additional
homologues in human and mouse, which form the TMC
protein family (Figures 1, 2). We subdivided the TMC
protein family into three subcategories A, B, and C. This
subfamily-classification is based on two major observations. First, the sequence homologies among the different
TMC protein sequences of individual species' do cluster
into three groups (Figures 1, 4, and additional file 1). Second, our analysis of the organization of vertebrate TMC

genes implied identical allocation of the individual TMCs
(Figure 3 and additional file 1).
On the basis of comparative structural predictions of all
mammalian TMCs we propose a basic topology of the
generic TMC protein with variable intracellular aminoand carboxyl-termini, a conserved core with eight membrane-spanning domains, and some variability in the
length of several intra- and extracellular loops (Figure 2).
This prediction further refines the previously published
TMC protein features [5,7]. The structural presumptions
for the region flanked by TM6 and TM7 were somewhat
ambiguous, despite the region's high conservation among
all TMC proteins with a high proportion of apolar amino
acids (Figure 1). We hypothesize that it is unlikely that

some members of the TMC family display an atypical
topology, thus we propose that the lipophilic intracellular
loop between TM6 and TM7 bears some flexibility, which
may enable this domain to integrate into the inner surface
of the phospholipid bilayer or even to pass through the
plasmamembrane (Figure 2).
The high amino acid sequence conservation of 75–96%
identity among the individual human and mouse TMC
proteins implies that mutations that alter the coding
sequence in the corresponding genes are subjected to
significant selective pressure; thus advocating that TMC
proteins have important cellular roles. Mutations in
TMC1 are responsible for the autosomal dominant
human hearing disorder DFNA36 and for the recessive

deafness DFNB7/11 [5]; the corresponding murine gene
Tmc1 also causes deafness in the mutant mouse strains
Beethoven (Bth) and deafness (dn) [6]. Bth/Bth mice display
altered potassium currents in early postnatal cochlear hair
cells, in particular Ik,n and Ik,f currents appear to be
depressed [10]. This observation led to the hypothesis that
Tmc1 may participate directly or indirectly in regulating
the permeability of potassium channels [10]. Because of
the high level of conservation of the amino acid sequences
among the eight mammalian TMC proteins (Figure 1,
Additional file 1), we speculate that other TMC proteins
may as well be modifiers of ion channels or transporters.
Our assembly of TMC protein sequences allowed us to
analyze their phylogenetic relationships (Figure 4).
Because our analysis did not reveal any TMC genes in
yeast and plants, we conclude that TMC proteins are a specific trait of animals. The C. elegans genome harbors two
genes encoding presumptive TMC subfamily A-like proteins, both of which branch off close to the center of the
phylogenetic tree, which may indicate similarity with the
primordial TMC protein sequence. It is interesting that
some of the intron locations of the two C. elegans genes
are conserved when compared with vertebrate TMC genes,
in particular with the TMC subfamily A (Additional file
3).
It is likely that the TMC family has diversified into three
subfamilies before the Protostomia and the Deuterostomia
diverged because the genome of the mosquito Anopheles
gambiae contains one putative member of each TMC subfamily. Interesting in this regard is that the fruit fly's
genome only has a single TMC subfamily A-like gene. The
vertebrate TMC gene family is diversified, with each subfamily represented by multiple members.

Conclusions
The recently identified genes encoding the cochlear transcripts for TMC1 and TMC2, and encoding the proteins
EVER1 and EVER2, belong to a novel gene family that is
conserved in animals. The TMC protein family has eight
members in vertebrates and forms three subfamilies, A, B,
and C. TMCs are proteins with a conserved core of eight
membrane-spanning domains. Most murine TMC genes
are widely expressed at relatively low transcription levels;
some TMC genes, however, display more restricted expression patterns.

www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, Celera Discovery System – http://
www.celeradiscoverysystem.com). We started this
procedure by using sequence fragments homologous to
the known mammalian TMC proteins. Individual fragments were assembled to longer contigs using multiple
alignment tools such as ClustalW [11] http://
www.es.embnet.org/Doc/phylodendron/clustalform.html
or
Multalin
[12] http://prodes.tou
louse.inra.fr/multalin/multalin.html.
Our
sequence
determination was continuously refined with the results
of repeated BlastN and tBlastN database searches with the
updated contigs, and finally we extended our search by
using genomic databases. The majority of Blast searches
were conducted with the default parameter settings. With
this strategy were able to generate presumptive "framework" contigs for the in databases less abundantly represented TMC genes. Because of the inter-species
conservation of protein-coding sequences we were able to
predict the presumptive DNA sequence encoding aminoand carboxyl-termini of various TMC proteins by comparing human and murine genomic TMC sequence.
We constantly refined individual TMC sequences by using
genomic sequence information and comparing gene
structures. In addition to iterative database searches, we
also took into account the results of gene prediction
algorithms using genomic DNA harboring TMC genes as
inputs (GeneScan [13], GenomeScan [14] http://
genes.mit.edu). Some invertebrate TMC genes were
already annotated as hypothetical proteins. We used
human and murine genome databases (GenBank/NCBI –
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) to determine the chromosomal locations of all mammalian TMC genes.
In a second phase, we used polymerase chain reaction and
5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)
experiments to obtain experimental proof for our cDNA
predictions and to determine murine TMC sequence that
was only ambiguously predicted.

Methods

Secondary structure predictions were done with PSORTII
[15] http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp. The phylogenetic distances between various TMC protein sequences were calculated with ClustalW [11] http://www.es.embnet.org/
Doc/phylodendron/clustal-form.html and the resulting
distance matrix Additional file: 1 (A) was visualized as a
tree diagram with centered node position using the
Phylodendron phylogenetic tree printer available at http:/
/iubio.bio.indiana.edu/treeapp.

Evolutionary distance between two gene structures was
defined as the reciprocal of the ratio of conserved intron
locations with respect to the coding sequences of the TMC

mRNA expression analysis
Organs we dissected from eight-week-old mice and
quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Specifically, we used
cortex, cerebellum, eye, cochlea, pituitary gland, salivary
gland, small intestine, colon, lung, thymus, liver, kidney,
heart, urinary bladder, testis, prostate, and ovary. We also
used in a control experiment aimed to verify Tmc2 expression in the cochlea, plasmid DNA obtained from an organ
of Corti cDNA library that was kindly provided by Dr. B.
Kachar, NIDCD/NIH. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini and Midi kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For RTPCR, 1 µg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA
using SuperscriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). One tenth of the resulting cDNA was used
as template for each PCR amplification with primers specific for each member of the TMC gene family (Tmc1: 5'GAAACAATGGTGGGGCAGGAA and 5'-GATGGCGGGAGGGAGACGAT, Tmc2: 5'-CCCCGGCCACCACCACAC and 5'-GAAGGGGCCACAGTCAAACGAG, Tmc3:

Tmc8: 5'-GGGTCAGACGGTGCTGTGCATA and 5'AGAGGAAGACACTGTTGAGTAG). Care was taken to
select primer pairs that amplify TMC transcripts encoded
in multiple exons to rule out the amplification of genomic
DNA contamination. Specific products obtained with
each primer pair from various organs and in several independent experiments were verified by sequencing. To estimate the quality of the template and to compare
expression levels, we amplified mouse glyceraldehyde 3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a ubiquitously
expressed abundant transcript with specific primers (5'AACGGGAAGCCCATCACC and 5'-CAGCCTTGGCAGCACCA). Cycling parameters were 94°C for 3 min, 8
cycles of (94°C20 s, 60°C20 s -1°C/cycle, 68°C45 s), followed by 17, 24 or 34 additional cycles of (94°C30 s,
52°C30 s, 68°C45 s) and 68°C for 5 min.

Authors' contributions
KG carried out iterative database searches to identify
mammalian members of the TMC family, he did PCR and
RACE experiments to obtain TMC cDNA sequence, and he
performed part of the transcript expression analysis. HM
identified non-mammalian and invertebrate TMC genes,
he assembled their coding sequences from public databases, and he performed part of the transcript expression
analysis. KG and HM drafted the manuscript. All authors
conceived of the study as result of discussions during the
group's laboratory meeting. SH participated in design and
coordination of the study and finalized the manuscript,
which has been read and approved by all authors.

Additional material
Additional File 1
Identity matrices of murine TMCs. (A) Percentage of amino acid residue
identity among individual murine TMC proteins. (B) Evolutionary distance ratios of the gene structures of individual murine TMC genes. We
calculated the ratio of conserved intron locations within the conserved
region of the eight murine Tmcs (see Figure 2). The reciprocal values of
the distance ratios represent the degree of conserved intron locations in
percent. The three subfamilies are shaded in green (TMC Subfamily A),
red (TMC Subfamily B), and blue (TMC Subfamily C).

Additional File 2
TMC signature sequence motif consensus sequence. Comparison of the
conserved TMC signature sequence motif among vertebrate and invertebrate TMC proteins. The consensus sequence is based on a 100% conservation of the three leading amino acid residues. All other capitalized
amino acids are conserved in more than 70% of all TMCs, and lower case
letters indicate the most probable amino acid residue.

Additional File 3
Comparison of invertebrate TMC gene structures. Comparison of the
intron locations projected onto a schematic comparison of invertebrate
TMC proteins. A representation of the conserved intron locations of the
vertebrate TMC subfamilyA is displayed as a reference. For details on the
color-coding of intron locations, see figure 3, with the addition that open
blue triangles refer to intron positions conserved within invertebrate cladi.
Each black box indicates a gap to adjust the alignment.
