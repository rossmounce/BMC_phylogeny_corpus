Molecular evolution of rbcL in three gymnosperm
families: identifying adaptive and coevolutionary
patterns

Abstract
Background: The chloroplast-localized ribulose-1, 5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), the primary
enzyme responsible for autotrophy, is instrumental in the continual adaptation of plants to variations in the
concentrations of CO2. The large subunit (LSU) of Rubisco is encoded by the chloroplast rbcL gene. Although
adaptive processes have been previously identified at this gene, characterizing the relationships between the
mutational dynamics at the protein level may yield clues on the biological meaning of such adaptive processes.
The role of such coevolutionary dynamics in the continual fine-tuning of RbcL remains obscure.
Results: We used the timescale and phylogenetic analyses to investigate and search for processes of adaptive
evolution in rbcL gene in three gymnosperm families, namely Podocarpaceae, Taxaceae and Cephalotaxaceae. To
understand the relationships between regions identified as having evolved under adaptive evolution, we
performed coevolutionary analyses using the software CAPS. Importantly, adaptive processes were identified at
amino acid sites located on the contact regions among the Rubisco subunits and on the interface between
Rubisco and its activase. Adaptive amino acid replacements at these regions may have optimized the holoenzyme
activity. This hypothesis was pinpointed by evidence originated from our analysis of coevolution that supported
the correlated evolution between Rubisco and its activase. Interestingly, the correlated adaptive processes between
both these proteins have paralleled the geological variation history of the concentration of atmospheric CO2.
Conclusions: The gene rbcL has experienced bursts of adaptations in response to the changing concentration of
CO2 in the atmosphere. These adaptations have emerged as a result of a continuous dynamic of mutations, many
of which may have involved innovation of functional Rubisco features. Analysis of the protein structure and the
functional implications of such mutations put forward the conclusion that this evolutionary scenario has been
possible through a complex interplay between adaptive mutations, often structurally destabilizing, and
compensatory mutations. Our results unearth patterns of evolution that have likely optimized the Rubisco activity
and uncover mutational dynamics useful in the molecular engineering of enzymatic activities.

Background
In spite of its slow non-specific catalysis the chloroplastlocalized ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase
(Rubisco, EC 4.1.1.39), the most abundant protein in
nature, is the primary enzyme responsible for autotrophy [1]. Rubisco is a bi-functional enzyme catalyzing
both the carboxylation of D-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
(RuBP) that initiates photosynthetic CO 2 fixation and
the oxygenation of RuBP that starts the nonessential
photo-respiratory pathway [2]. Its holoenzyme in green
algae and higher plants consists of eight large subunits
(LSUs) encoded by the chloroplast (cp) gene rbcL and
eight small subunits (SSUs) encoded by the nuclear
gene rbcS. Active sites are formed at the intra-dimer
interfaces among the C-terminal, a/b barrel domain of
one large subunit and the N-terminal domain of another
[3]. CO2 and O2 mutually compete as substrates for the
active sites, and the ratio of carboxylation to oxygenation ultimately affects the efficiency of net carbon assimilation [4]. Understanding of the molecular evolution of
rbcL genes may shed light on the functional/structural
features governing Rubisco activity. The knowledge is
also paramount from the biotechnological point of view
since photosynthesis is tightly linked to the delicate balance between carboxylation and oxygenation. Subtle
alteration of this balance can have a significant impact
upon photosynthetic productivity [5].
Most of the evolutionary changes optimizing Rubisco’s function have been likely subjected to selection
forces owing to the direct relationship between this
function and the biological fitness of the plant. Most
molecular changes favouring the enzyme function
would be fixed by adaptive evolution, while the changes
compromising its activity would be removed by purifying selection. Following the inverse rational, investigation of adaptive evolution processes in Rubisco can aid
in identifying key changes in its function. Adaptive
evolution has seldom been observed in cp genes [6],
mainly due to: i) Low rates of evolution of protein-coding cp genes [7], which challenges the sensitivity of the
methods to identify selection due to the lack of statistical power [8]; ii) With the exception of few cases [6],
cp genes present a low propensity to undergo duplication [9], a fundamental mechanism in generating the
source of novel functions [10]; and iii) The lack of
models that realistically parameterize the evolution of
cp genes, known to present codon usage bias and
hence to yield misleading selection results when inappropriate models are applied [11,12]. Nonetheless, the
use of more realistic models may prove successful
in identifying true adaptive molecular changes in cp
genes, many of which would be linked to plant adaptive
radiations [13].

Rubisco enzymatic efficiency has been shown to be
fine-tuned in diverse autotrophy species [14]. Significant
positive selection events have been also identified in the
RbcL subunit of most land plant lineages by using simulation approaches [15]. In particular, the adaptive evolution of rbcL genes has been found in the aquatic plant
Potamogeton [16] and the F-type lineage of Conocephalum [17]. These findings make it plausible to hypothesize that RbcL subunit may have undergone “continual
fine-tuning” in green plants to adapt to CO2 concentration changes across geological epochs [18]. How are
these adaptive process reflected at the molecular level?
To understand and answer these questions, adaptive
evolution analysis must be complemented with the identification of coevolutionary dynamics that can highlight
the intricate co-adaptive relationships between residues
in the protein under an estimated timescale [14,19]. In
this respect, current molecular evolutionary methods
such as the identification of coevolutionary sites [20]
and relaxed molecular clock inference models [21,22]
offer a unique opportunity to dissect the rbcL gene
fine-tuning.
Podocarpaceae comprises members that extend both
southern and northern hemispheres, accounting for
nearly 14% of the gymnosperm diversity. The family is
predominantly occupying mesic temperate and sunny tropical mountain habitats [23]. Taxaceae (also known as
taxads or the yew family), including 25 species, is a widespread albeit locally endangered gymnosperm family [24].
The genus Cephalotaxus was previously listed in the
Taxaceae [25]. However, recent molecular evidences confirmed that it should be treated as a family (Cephalotaxaceae) [26]. Since these three families possess different
contemporary net diversification, characterizations of the
evolutionary processes in key genes may help to unearth
the dynamics of their species diversification. In the present study we conduct an exhaustive analysis of such evolutionary dynamics and address the following questions: i)
Whether and to what extent have adaptive evolution
played a role in the evolutionary innovation of the rbcL
gene; ii) How important have this evolutionary force been
in the ecological diversification of the three gymnosperm
families (Taxaceae, Cephalotaxaceae and Podocarpaceae);
and iii) What is the coevolutionary pattern within the
RbcL subunit of these families?

Results
Alignments and sequence characteristics

The alignment comprised 1269 positions (423 codons) of
the rbcL gene. Gaps were excluded from the sequences.

was determined by Modeltest 3.7 [27] and Datamonkey
2010 website (http://www.datamonkey.org) [28].
Dating the phylogenetic divergence events

Two monophyletic clades of Taxaceae-Cephalotaxaceae
and Podocarpaceae were identified by the Bayesian analysis, both supported with high posterior probabilities
(Figure 1). Within Podocarpaceae, besides Podocarpus
three well-supported genera were obtained: Nageia,
Dacrycarpus and Dacrydium. Dacrydium was basal to
the remain Podocarpaceae species. The genus Podocarpus diverged into two groups, Podocarpus I and Podocarpus II. In the Taxaceae-Cephalotaxaceae clade, four
major lineages were resolved. Among them the TorreyaAmentotaxus lineage was sister to the remainder; the
family Cephalotaxaceae was sister to the three remaining
genera of the family Taxaceae; and the genus Taxus was
the sister to the Pseudotaxus-Austrotaxus lineage. These
results indicated that the divergence between TaxaceaeCephalotaxaceae and Podocarpaceae represented the
first major split during the evolution of the three
families and that Cephalotaxaceae is nested in Taxaceae.
The absolute divergence time and evolutionary rates
of all nodes in the tree were estimated under the uncorrelated lognormal model (UCLD), and the global atmospheric CO2 concentrations were also mapped according
to the estimated timescale (Figure 1, Table 1). This analysis provided a time estimate of 204 Mya to the most
recent common ancestor (MRCA) for the extant Podocarpaceae (Figure 1). The results demonstrated that the
splitting between the genera Nageia and Podocarpus
occurred during early Paleocene following the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K/T) extinction event, after which the
genus Podocarpus segregated into two groups (Podocarpus I and II). The lineage Torreya-Amentotaxus diverged
from the remainder of the other members in TaxaceaeCephalotaxaceae during the Jurassic; Cephalotaxaceae
departed with the rest three genera in Taxaceae during
the Cretaceous; and Taxus split with Pseudotaxus-Austrotaxus during the Tertiary.
Consistent adaptive evolution in the phylogeny of rbcL

The primary proportion of the sites (p0 > 89%, ω0 < 0.1) in
the three families were under purifying selection (Figure 2,
Table 2). A small proportion of sites (p2 = 2%, ω2 = 2.92)
were under positive selection (Table 2). Seven sites (A11V,
Q14K, K30Q, S95N, V99A, I133L, and L225I) were significantly identified as positively selected sites under both
PAML and Selecton programs via random-site models,
and three more (G86D, S143A, and T262V) were found to
have evolved under adaptive evolution using the branchsite models. One site (K30Q) was also recognized as positively selected via conservative nested models (M1a/M2a).
The significant level of nested models was assessed by the

Page 3 of 19

likelihood ratio test (Table 2). The c2 test indicated that
all the alternative hypotheses (M2a, M3, and M8) in the
random-site models significantly outperformed their comparable null test (M1a, M0, and M7/M8a). Moreover, the
branch-site model A (ω 2 estimated) fit five branches
(Podocarpaceae, Podocarpus I and II, Taxaceae, and
Taxus) significantly better than its null model (ω2 = 1
fixed) (Table 2 and 3). Podocarpaceae and Podocarpus I
and II were also identified to be under positive selection,
even after correcting for multiple tests by the Bonferroni
correction [29] (Table 3). By contrast, when Torreya and
Cephalotaxaceae were specified as the foreground
branches, both the test and null models had similar loglikelihood values, indicating that there was not enough evidence to support adaptive diversifying scenarios.
Four sites (A11V, G86D, V99A, and I133L) were
detected under adaptive evolution along the ancestral
branch of Podocarpaceae (Figure 3). The ancestor of
Podocarpus I presented two positively selected candidate
sites (A11V and Q14K); however, neither of them was
significantly supported by the posterior probabilities. As
for Podocarpus II, two sites (S143A and T262V) were
identified under selection with strong statistical supports. In addition, three sites (A11V, V99A, and I133L)
were found to be positively selected on the branch leading to the ancestor of Taxaceae, whereas only one
(K30Q) was identified in the ancestor of Taxus.
Inter-dependent evolution of amino acid sites in the RbcL
subunit

Analysis of coevolution in RbcL using CAPS identified
21 co-evolution groups (Figure 4). A coevolution group
was defined to include all those sites that presented coevolution signal with all the other sites within the same
group: if site A was coevolving with B, B with C and A
with C, then all three sites were included within one
coevolution group. The largest group (Figure 5) included
four sites (11V, 14K, 19D, and 56A), while the smallest
contained only two. The residues belonging to most of
the co-evolving pairs presented significant correlations
with their physicochemical properties, including hydrophobicity, molecular weight, or both of them. For example, four of the co-evolution pairs (11V/19D, 14K/19D,
11V/86D, and 50P/219V) detected among the 21 coevolution groups exhibited correlated hydrophobicity;
meanwhile, the other four pairs (14L/258R, 14K/142P,
95N/145S, and 255V/251M) correlated in their molecular weight variance.

Discussion
Adaptive evolution of the rbcL gene in the three
gymnosperm families

The random-site models [30] were employed to examine
the adaptive evolution of the rbcL gene in three

Recent improvements in the statistical models made it

acid sites in the RbcL subunit of both the ancestor of
Podocarpaceae and that of Taxaceae-Cephalotaxaceae
had undergone adaptive evolution. By contrast, no adaptive evolution was detected in the ancestor of Cephalotaxaceae. Moreover, within Podocarpaceae, no positively

selected site was found in the ancestral branch of Podocarpus I; however, two were detected in the branch
leading to Podocarpus II (Figure 1). In Taxaceae, for the
ancestor of Taxus, site 30 was identified as positively
selected; but no such a site was found in the ancestor of
Torreya. Totally, ten positively selected sites (A11V,
Q14K, K30Q, G86D, S95N, V99A, I133L, S143A, L225I,
and T262V) were identified in all the tests.
To fully understand the mechanism of the molecular
adaptation of rbcL gene, both the structural and the

functional significance of those ten positively selected
sites need to be elucidated (Table 4). Seven (A11V,
Q14K, K30Q, I133L, S143A, L225I, and T262V) of the
positively selected sites are located at the interface of
Rubisco subunits, whereas the other three (G86D, S95N,
and V99A) are at the interface between Rubisco and its
activase (Table 2 and 4).
Most of the amino acid sites detected to be under
adaptive evolution have been previously identified to
have important functional roles. Of these adaptively
selected sites, site 11 shows an adaptive substitution
from Alanine to Valine. Valine has an additional methylene group (-CH2-) in comparison with Alanine, allows
a stronger van de Waal binding with the other residues
at the LSU 2 C-terminus [33], tightening therefore the
combination of LSU2 dimer [34]. In addition, lysine and
glutamine present side-chains that are positively and
negatively charged, respectively [35]. Therefore the
replacement of Q by K at site 14, identified to have
evolved under positive selection, may create extra ionic
bonds with its proximal amino acid sites [36]. Importantly, site 30 is very close to site 28 [3], both possessing
hydrophilic side-chains (Table 2). Kapralov and Filatov
(2007) noted that site 28 is highly prone to fix amino
acid replacements by positive selection in green plants
[15]. Future examinations on sites 28 and 30 by using
site-directed mutagenesis may unveil whether their
hydrophilic side-chain substitutions have brought advantageous effects. The replacements at sites 133 and 143
may improve the stability of LSU2 dimer by modifying
side-chain physicochemical characters [37,38]. Moreover, the nonsynonymous substitutions on sites 225 and
262 could contribute to the linkage of LSU and SSU

subunits (Table 4). Recent genetic analyses of a hybrid
Rubisco pointed to that the combination of LSU and
SSU have effects on the holoenzyme expression [39].
Rubisco activase is involved in the opening of the
closed state of the Rubisco form to release RuBP, producing the active enzyme form [40]. The physical contact
between the Rubisco site 89 and the activase site
314 has been reported by Li et al (2005) [41]. Moreover,
the negatively charged Rubisco site 93 is potentially
complementary to the positively charged activase site
312 [42]. Hence, changes of the three neighbouring sites
(G86D, S95N, and V99A) around sites 89 and 93 may
affect the contacts between the Rubisco and its activase.
In summary, positively selected sites identified in the
rbcL gene of the three gymnosperm families are located
either on the contact surface between Rubisco subunits
or between the Rubisco and its activase. Nonsynonymous substitutions among them have great potentials
to optimize the enzyme characteristics.
RbcL gene is located in the large single copy region of
chloroplast genome [43,44]. It has been regarded as a
region with no evidence for adaptive evolution [45], but
recent research has brought this into question [15]. Currently, Ohno’s model is frequently used to describe protein evolution and adaptation [46], which emphasizes
the role that gene duplication plays in the adjustment of
protein functions [47,48]. The “gene sharing” model
stresses that it is at the single copy gene stage, namely
before the occurrence of gene duplication, that functional genes have already adapted [49]. For instance, studies on the eye lens crystallins showed that the gene
duplication indeed occurred after the protein had
diverged from its ancestral function [50,51]. This study
on the rbcL gene further unveils adaptive evolutionary
processes in the single copy chloroplast gene. It has
been known that for rbcL, only a few nonsynonymous
substitutions, especially those at catalytic active sites on
the LSU and SSU interface or between the Rubisco
and its activase interface, can significantly change the
Rubisco features (e.g. thermal stability, catalytic
efficiency, and CO 2 /O 2 specificity) [52]. Indeed, the
positively selected sites we identified in the three gymnosperm families are all located at these positions.
Adaptive substitutions at the sites, possibly generated
during chloroplast DNA replication or repair [53], may
impose great potential for optimizing the Rubisco functional/structural characteristics. As shown in Table 2,
our results suggest that: i) mutations at most sites in
rbcL (p0 = 89.2%, ω0 = 0.07) may be deleterious; ii) 5.8%
of the substitutions probably have no significant effect
on fitness; and iii) 2.3% of the replacements are likely to
improve the Rubisco performance. It is therefore reasonable to postulate that the three gymnosperm families
may have adaptively responded to habitat pressures by

Page 10 of 19

adjusting the Rubisco function/structure during their
evolution.
Historic adaptation of the rbcL gene under continual
changing of CO2 concentration

The historic accumulation of nucleotide substitutions in
the rbcL gene has supplied the Podocarpaceae species
with differentiated Rubisco catalytic efficiency, which
could contribute to their adaptive radiation into diverse
ecological niches [54]. By contrast, the absence of rbcL
adaptation in Cephalotaxus and Torreya may explain why
their members tend to be locally distributed (Table 2).
Two positively selected sites were identified at the
ancestral branch of Podocarpaceae and each was at the
interface between the Rubisco and its activase (Table 2).
The global CO2 concentration has been acutely changing since 170 Mya to 65 Mya [55]. Our results showed
that the ancestor of Podocarpaceae diverged from Taxaceae-Cephalotaxaceae around 204 Mya; and its descendants started to diverge about 134 Mya [56]. From 170
Mya to 134 Mya, the rbcL variants in the ancestor of
Podocarpaceae that could better adapt to the global
reduction of CO2 concentration became consequently
fixed (Figure 1, Table 2). Sage and Coleman (2001) has
noted that increasing the expression level of the Rubisco
and its activase is an effective solution for plants to
respond to the reduction of CO 2 concentration [57].
Here we further demonstrated that the simultaneous
and inter-dependent adjustment of the two enzymes
provides an alternative adaptive mode.
Many transgenic manipulations have been attempted
to improve Rubisco’s catalytic performance, since its
property largely determines the maximum efficiency of
photosynthesis in the use of light, water, and fertilizer N
resources [58]. The function of Rubisco in terrestrial
plants is identical. Evolutionary pressures seem to have
driven it towards more efficient utilization of CO2, and
recent analyses have indicated that the optimal performance of Rubisco is basically determined by CO2 concentration [59,60]. In this study, adaptive evolution of
the rbcL gene has been detected in Podocarpaceae and
Podocarpus I and II (Table 3), which implies that the
Podocarpaceae species have undergone continual modification in their RbcL subunit for better fitness along
with the changing atmosphere CO2 concentration. The
positively selected sites identified (Table 3) may also
benefit future studies for improving the Rubisco efficiency and for elucidating the interactions between the
enzyme and its activase [61].
Site-specific coevolution in RbcL subunit

To further understand the complex evolutionary patterns, we also analysed the inter-dependence among
amino acid regions in the RbcL subunit. Adaptive

Sen et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:29
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/29

evolution is only expected to occur on functionally and
structurally meaningful amino acid sites where nonsynonymous substitutions are most likely to destabilise
and hence to compromise organism’s fitness [62,63].
Consequently, evolution of biological innovation is
dependent upon the fixation of mutations close in the
structure that can compensate the destabilising effects
of innovative mutations. This may well explain the pattern we observe in the Rubisco, with many of the mutations that are under adaptive evolution and that coevolve occurring at the interface of the protein dimer
where stability is essential for the preservation of
enzyme function and integrity. In support of the co-evolutionary hypothesis as a mean to fix innovative mutations in the RbcL subunit, previous research has shown
that when multiple amino acid replacements are introduced, significant changes can occur in both enzyme
catalytic efficiency and specificity [64]. In our co-evolutionary analyses, 21 co-evolution groups were identified
within the RbcL subunit. In particular, evolutionary
dependencies were recognized among sites belonging to
different domains (Figure 5). Some correlated pairs (e.g.
251M and 255 V) were linearly proximal, whereas the
others (e.g. 19D and 56A) were linearly distant but
structurally proximal. Among the co-evolving sites, we
also identified structurally and linearly distant sites (e.g.
14 K and 86D) (Figure 4 and 5). Although certain studies have attributed a biological meaning for the linearly
proximal sites [65], many other reports elucidated that
physical connections can be established between distant
functional sites in the quaternary protein structures
[66-69].

Conclusions
This research presents substantial evidence that point to
a complex adaptive process associated with the functional innovation of the Rubisco protein. This process
involves a continuous checking of the structural and
functional consequences of the fixation of novel mutations as well as the amelioration of the effects by such
mutations through compensatory replacement events.
Several other conditions related to the population genetics of the individuals have to be met in order for a compensatory mutation to be fixed before the individuals
carrying the destabilising mutations are purged by selection. Among the possible hypothetical scenarios is the
relaxation of the action of selection or the action of
other buffering mechanisms. Species from both Taxaceae and Cephalotaxaceae are characterized by their
small population sizes and clonality, which makes it
feasible for genetic drift to act and facilitate the fixation
of the mutations regardless of their immediate fitness
consequences. Although this seems to be a possible scenario, several points remain to be investigated in future

Page 11 of 19

studies such as to assess the real inter-dependence
among mutations through directed mutagenesis or to
examine the strength of genetic drift at the population
levels. Our research however opens exciting new avenues that may lead to a more complete understanding
of the functional novelties in the Rubisco among
gymnosperms.

DNA sequences of the coding regions obtained experimentally plus those retrieved from the public databases
(Table 5) were multiple aligned using the MUSCLE software [70]. To improve the accuracy of phylogenetic
inference, we excluded: i) multiple data from identical
species, ii) sequences containing frame-shift mutations,
and iii) ambiguously aligned regions. The appropriate
DNA substitution model was identified by Modeltest
v.3.7 package [27] via comparing 56 available models
using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The data
set was also uploaded to the Datamonkey 2010 website
for the estimation of the best fit model [28]. The tree

topology inferred using the appropriate model for rbcL
sequences was utilized as pre-defined tree in the
adaptive and non-independent evolution analysis.
The following nodes within the phylogeny were chosen to constrain for a rate consistent with the known
relationships: i) based on the Cratonia cotyledon fossils
[71], the split of Gnetum and Welwitschia was constrained to 110 Mya (Node 72); ii) the good estimation
of the split of Taxus and Cephalotaxaceae was constrained to 169 Mya (Node 66) [56]; iii) Node 75 was
constrained to 225 Mya based on the earliest Pinaceaetype seed [72]; iv) Node 73 was constrained to 125 Mya
based on the earliest Ephedra-type seed [73]. Following
the suggestion of the authors of BEAST, we ran the
empty alignment before the real data to avoid misspecification of dating and taxon sampling.
We applied BEAST to infer topology, branch lengths,
and dates for the rbcL gene. As the relationships of Taxaceae and Cephalotaxaceae families have been historically under debates, the prior information on these two
families was not given before the estimation. A normal
distribution was applied over the estimating of the absolute ages via the MCMC process. BEAST runs of 4 ×
10 7 generations, saving data every 1,000 generations,

Sen et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:29
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/29

produced 40,000 estimates of dates under a Yule speciation prior and an uncorrelated relaxed clock [74] for the
rbcL gene dataset. Convergence statistics was analyzed
in Tracer, resulting in 36,000 post-burn-in trees. We
used TreeAnnotator v. 1.5.3 [74] to produce maximum
clade credibility trees from the post-burn-in trees and to
determine the 95% probability density of ages for all
nodes in the tree.
To illustrate the relationship between the ancestral
adaptation and the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, the RCO2 value along with the time scale was
mapped under the phylogeny (Figure 1) [55].
Detection of positive and negative selection sites

Identification of adaptive evolution (positive selection) is
fundamental to our understanding of the process of
adaptation and diversifying selection. The general consensus is that nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions
(d N ), whose alternatives leading to a change in the
codon and its corresponding amino acid, can be scaled
by the number of synonymous replacements (dS), which
are nucleotide changes that only change the codon but
not the amino acid and are consequently neutrally fixed
and proportional to the divergence time between the
sequences. Because the d N changed the amino acid
sequence and protein function depending on its structure, this parameter is often under the filter of Natural
selection. It follows consequently that the nonsynonymous-to-synonymous rates ratio (ω = d N/dS) can be
considered as a stringent measure of selection [75,76].
Positive adaptive evolution occurs episodically during
the evolution of proteins and this selection signal is
generally swamped in a background signal of negative
selection, which makes it difficult to robustly identify
adaptive evolution. In order to identify signs of adaptive
evolution we used two maximum-likelihood based models implemented in the CODEML program from PAML
package version 4.1 [32], the random-site model and the
modified branch-site model, for detecting the positive
and negative selection sites within rbcL sequences
among lineages. The random-site model allows the ω to
vary among amino acid sites within the multiple
sequence alignment and this parameter is estimated by
maximum-likelihood following Goldman and Yang
(1994) [77]. Conversely, the branch-site model (BSM)
accounts for the variation in selective constraints among
sites and lineages in the phylogeny synchronously.
Within the BSM, we applied the modified model A test
to reduce the false positive results as advised in the
manual file of PAML version 4.1 [78]. In addition to the
previous models, we also compared codon-based models
that estimate one or several ω values for the different
categories of codons. We conducted the likelihood ratio

Page 14 of 19

test (LRT) [79] to compare the different nested models
(M0 vs. M3, M1a vs. M2a, M7 vs. M8, M8a vs. M8, and
alternative test (ω 2 estimated) vs. null test (ω 2 = 1,
fixed)) [80]. In the branch-site models, the branches
were selected to testify whether the species have a bigger opportunity to undergo an episodic adaptive evolution along with the acutely changing atmospheric CO2
concentration (Figure 1, grey regions). The following
seven lineages were selected: (i) Taxaceae-Cephalotaxaceae, (ii) Taxus; (iii) Torreya; (iv) Podocarpaceae; (v)
Podocarpus I; (vi) Podocarpus II; and (vii) Cephalotaxaceae. To address the problem of multiple comparisons,
the Bonferroni correction was employed during the continuous checking with the A-A1 models [29].
The multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was also submitted to the Selecton website [81] for the comparison
between empirical models and mechanistic empirical
combination (MEC) models. Moreover, the ancestral
states of the rbcL sequences were reconstructed via the
DAMBE package [82] and the ASR module on the Datamonkey website [28,83]. The offspring sequences were
compared with the ancestral sequences on each node.
And the sequence was submitted to European Bioinformatics Institute (http://www.isb-sib.ch/ Swiss-model) for
predicting the three-dimensional structure of the RbcL
subunit.
Identification of intra-protein coevolutionary pattern

To understand the broad implications of the amino acid
replacements in the RbcL subunit we conducted an analysis of the evolutionary dependencies among sites to identify functional/structural dependencies among residues. If
two amino acid sites were under adaptive evolution and
these sites were co-evolving, this may indicate their functional/structural dependency. Intra-protein co-evolution in
rbcL was tested via the program CAPS [20]. This algorithm implemented in this program takes the phylogenetic
dependencies into account and correct them [84] and has
been reported to outperform other approaches [85].
Broadly, CAPS compares the correlated variance of
the evolutionary rates at two sites corrected by the time
since the divergence of the two sequences. The significance of the results was evaluated by randomization of
pairs in the alignment, calculation of their correlation
values, and comparison of the real values with the distribution of 10,000 randomly sampled values. The stepdown permutation procedure was employed to correct
for multiple tests and non-independence of data [86].
An alpha value of 0.001 was applied to minimize type I
error. The correlated variability between amino acid
sites was weighted by the level of substitutions per
synonymous site in order to normalize parameters by
the time of sequence divergence [87].

Gymnosperm plants played an important role in Earth’s
flora, especially in the prehistoric ages. In this manuscript,
the authors use elegant molecular evolutionary analyses to
answer some open questions about the evolutionary processes tailoring the chloroplast-coded rbcL gene during
the adaptation to the changing CO2 concentration in the
atmosphere. The authors use rbcL coding sequences from
three gymnosperm families. The rbcL is a very specific and
very constrained protein, coded in the chloroplast genome
and also being in complex with the rbcS, which is coded in
the nucleus. The three gymnosperm families are good subjects for this analysis because i) they represent almost 14%
of the gymnosperm diversity and can be found globally on
the Earth, ii) we have fossil records allowing to constrain
the phylogenetic tree timescale.
The authors present a robust evolutionary analysis
based on the multiple alignment of rbcL coding
sequences from different gymnosperm species. They
found that a complex adaptation process occurred during
the evolution of these taxa. They also discussed the structural and functional consequences of these processes and
concluded that certain compensatory replacement mutations could play important role in the fixation of the
functionally novel mutations. The analysis is very sound
and in most cases based on different methods and models. The basic idea and the results can be interesting for
the broader community.
I have only some theoretical questions and three
minor technical comments.
Questions:
Are there any known examples for the same compensatory mutation pairs from other plant species (i.e. evidence for convergent evolution)?
Authors’ response: Recent report of the modification
on both large and small subunits of Rubisco enzyme in
Flaveria (Asteraceae) might be an example for the similar patterns [88]. The two subunits are under selection
during the evolution from C3 to C4 photosynthesis. This
pattern may be an evidence for convergent evolution
under ecological pressures. However, the compensatory
mutation pair is not coincided in the study.
How could the geographical isolation of different
populations influence the results of this study? Are

Page 15 of 19

there any samples (rbcL sequences) from geographically
well separated plants from the same species? Do you
expect any polymorphisms at any replacement site in
the small populations of these gymnosperm species?
Authors’ response: If we take the geographical CO2
variation into account, the geographical isolation of different populations will significantly influence the results
of the present study. As has been reported previously, the
rbcL gene has undergone adaptive evolution during the
radiation in the Hawaiian endemic genus Schiedea,
which demonstrates that rbcL gene evolved under strong
positive selection impacted by the geographical isolation
[13]. Nonetheless, the present research is mainly focused
on the relations above species level, so the samples (rbcL
sequences) from the same species are excluded in the
analyses. The polymorphisms at those replacement sites
probably exist in the small populations of these gymnosperm species.
The inferred tree topology and the taxonomic classification of the genera in Taxaceae seem to be different.
How can you explain this?
Authors’ response: Since its lower evolutionary rate,
the rbcL gene has certain limitations on the deeper phylogenetic levels (e.g. at the genus level) [89]. On the other
respect, the molecular adaptation in rbcL gene per se
also has impact on the inferring of the phylogenetic trees
[17]. The above two factors may be the explanation for
the disagreement between the inferred tree topology and
the taxonomic classification.
Is it possible to deduce from this analysis the ancestral
sequence of the rbcL gene characteristic for the different
nodes?
Authors’ response: Positive answer. However, more
experimental data is required for the inference of the
rbcL gene characteristic even though the inferring of the
ancestral sequence from the current ones is of statistical
efficiency [90,91]. We believe that much more work have
been left for the further research after our computational
estimation.
Comments:
Reading the abstract at a first glance, it is not clear
what is the relation between Rubisco and rbcL. Clarifying this would help the readers who are not familiar in
plant biology.
Authors’ response: We agree with this remark and
changed the sentence accordingly. One sentence has been
added into the abstract especially for the introduction of
the relation between Rubisco and rbcL gene.
It is very difficult to review the tables in general, and
especially the Table 3. Using grids, or re-structuring
them would help a lot.
Authors’ response: We agree with this remark and restructured Table 3(new Table 2) accordingly.

Sen et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:29

Referencing Figure 4 is before the first reference to
Figure 3, and no reference for Table 1 in the text.
Authors’ response: We appreciate the constructive
comment. The order of referencing figures has been rechecked. Since Table 1shows the original plant materials
of this research, which cannot be omitted, we changed its
appearance from the first table (former Table 1) into the
last one (new Table 5).
Reviewer’s report 3

Dr Nicolas Galtier, CNRS-Université Montpellier II
Laboratoire “Genome, Populations, Interactions, Adaptation”, Montpellier, France
This manuscript analyses the molecular evolution of
the essential rbcL gene in three gymnosperm families.
The functional relevance of amino-acid sites detected as
positively selected or co-evolving is discussed. Here are
my major comments:
The text is quite affirmative regarding divergence
dates, and their relationship with atmospheric CO 2
abundance. I am not sure that molecular dating is that
trustable, even with the use of clock-relaxed models, as
illustrated by many controversies in the recent literature
(e.g. Graur & Martin 2004 Trends Genet, Douzery et al.
2004 PNAS, Peterson et al. 2004 PNAS, Roger & Hug
2006 Philos Trans, Emerson 2007 Syst Biol), owing to
paleontological uncertainty and tricky rate/time decoupling [92-96]. Some prudence would appear required
here, and the uncertainty of date estimates could be discussed. This is especially true knowing that the uncorrelated model in BEAST was used here, an approach
which was criticized in the recent past (Lepage et al.
2007 Mol Biol Evol) [97].
Authors’ response: Due to the paleontological uncertainty and trick rate/time decoupling, it is still an unresolved scientific theme whether the modern molecular
clock has the ability to reconcile the fossil evidence and
the time estimation [98]. However, as indicated in many
other literature (e.g. Welch & Bromham 2005 Trends
Ecol Evol, Ho 2007 J Avian Biol, Ho 2009 Biol Lett), lots
of recent methodological advances have been carried out
focusing on the topic [99-101]. Specifically, although correlated model (also known as correlated-rates model, or
CR model) outperforms the uncorrelated model (also
known as independent-rates model, or IR model) in the
instance provided by Lepage et al (2007) [97], several
authors have noticed that the uncorrelated model is better than the correlated model during estimating the
dynamics of evolutionary rates in other instances
[22,102-104]. Moreover, Zhong et al. (2009) argued quite
recently that the uncorrelated model is superior to the
correlated model in guesstimating the episodic rate acceleration in ancestral plant lineages [105]. Collectively, all

Page 16 of 19

the above conclusions indicate that the modern molecular clock relied on uncorrelated model is applicable for
our present study on the gymnosperm plants.
The reason for species sampling in this study is not
obvious. Just three families were (thoroughly enough)
sampled, when the focus of the study is on rbcL adaptation during the > 200 Mya of gymnosperm evolution. A
more balanced sampling across gymnosperm families
might help corroborate some of the results reported
here.
Authors’ response: The three families (Podocarpaceae,
Taxaceae and Cephalotaxaceae) represent over 14% of
the gymnosperm diversity and can be found globally on
the Earth [23,24]. Moreover, reliable fossil records can be
obtained to calibrate molecular clock for dating the time
of the phylogenetic trees [56]. So the thoroughly enough
sampled species in the three families could partially
represent adaptive and coevolutionary patterns of rbcL
gene in the related gymnosperms under geological timeline. And we also believe that further research including
other families will shed new lights on the big thesis.
Along the same lines, it would be good to know
whether the sites identified as positively selected or coevolving in gymnosperms behave similarly in angiosperms (and perhaps other groups of plants), for which a
huge database of rbcL sequences is available.
Authors’ response: As far as we can see, the atmospheric CO2 concentration is one important factor (also
known as ecological pressure) related to the adaptation
of Rubisco enzyme [14,60]. Nevertheless, other factors
also have impact on the evolution of this enzyme. For
instance, the C3/C4 photosynthesis in angiosperms have
effects on the modification of rbcL gene [5]and rbcS gene
[88]. The comparison analyses merely along the identical
timeline, ignoring other ecological pressures, may mislead
the conclusions. Since the above reasons, we only focus
our sampling on the present families.
The discussion emphasizes potential adaptive processes, in possible connection to CO2 availability across
time. I note that if rbcL evolution was related to atmospheric CO2 variations, we would expect adaptive evolution to occur simultaneously in contemporary branches
of the tree, in line with sudden RCO2 changes. Such a
pattern is not clearly detected, so I wonder what in the
data makes the author link rbcL evolution to atmospheric CO2 concentration, especially knowing that the
adaptative signal is not prominent.
Authors’ response: The ability to undertake adaptive
evolution depends on several factors. Gymnosperm plants
played an important role in Earth’s flora, especially in
the prehistoric ages. This implies that the species of the
three gymnosperm families have a higher feasibility to
undergo adaptation in the prehistoric branches. Along

Sen et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:29
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/29

with the rising of angiosperms, members from the contemporary branches of gymnosperm plants are characterized by their small population sizes, which make them
feasible for genetic drift. The current analysis results and
the biological background drew us a big imagination of
the ancestral rbcL gene adaptation associating with the
variations of the atmospheric CO2 concentration.
