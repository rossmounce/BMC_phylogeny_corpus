Abstract
Background: Hypoxia-tolerant human glioma cells reduce oxygen consumption rate in response
to oxygen deficit, a defense mechanism that contributes to survival under moderately hypoxic
conditions. In contrast, hypoxia-sensitive cells lack this ability. As it has been previously shown that
hypoxia-tolerant (M006x, M006xLo, M059K) and -sensitive (M010b) glioma cells express
differences in mitochondrial function, we investigated whether mitochondrial DNA-encoded
mutations are associated with differences in the initial response to oxygen deficit.
Results: The mitochondrial genome was sequenced and 23 mtDNA alterations were identified,
one of which was an unreported mutation (T-C transition in base pair 14634) in the hypoxiasensitive cell line, M010b, that resulted in a single amino acid change in the gene encoding the ND6
subunit of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex I). The T14634C mutation did not
abrogate ND6 protein expression, however, M010b cells were more resistant to rotenone, an
agent used to screen for Complex I mutations, and adriamycin, an agent activated by redox cycling.
The specific function of mtDNA-encoded, membrane-embedded Complex I ND subunits is not
known at present. Current models suggest that the transmembrane arm of Complex I may serve
as a conformationally driven proton channel. As cellular respiration is regulated, in part, by proton
flux, we used homology-based modeling and computational molecular biology to predict the 3D
structure of the wild type and mutated ND6 proteins. These models predict that the T14634C
mutation alters the structure and orientation of the trans-membrane helices of the ND6 protein.
Conclusion: Complex I ND subunits are mutational hot spots in tumor mtDNA. Genetic changes
that alter Complex I structure and function may alter a cell's ability to respond to oxygen deficit
and consolidate hypoxia rescue mechanisms, and may contribute to resistance to
chemotherapeutic agents that require redox cycling for activation.

Background
Human tumors frequently contain hypoxic cells that are
more resistant to the killing effects of ionizing radiation
and certain chemotherapeutic agents, are genetically
unstable and metastasize frequently [1]. Further, hypoxic
tumor sub-volumes are a negative prognostic indicator for
local-regional control and progression-free survival in
human tumors such as squamous cell carcinoma of the
head and neck and uterine cervix [2,3]. Thus, hypoxic
tumor cells are a source of local treatment failure and disease progression.
The mechanisms by which normal cells, tissues and
organisms tolerate hypoxic stress are of great interest in
comparative physiology and provide paradigms that can
be tested in tumor model systems. While our current
understanding of hypoxic stress defense mechanisms is
incomplete, some general principles have emerged.
Hypoxia-tolerant vertebrate species utilize a repertoire of
molecular and biochemical strategies to adapt to and survive periods of oxygen limitation. The first of these is a
metabolic or "defense" phase that is initiated within minutes of sensing an oxygen deficit, followed by an "adaptation" phase that proceeds over hours or days [4]. The
metabolic changes that occur during the "defense" phase
result in reversible suppression of oxygen consumption,
significant down-regulation of ATP-consuming processes,
and membrane channel arrest, which collectively result in
conditions in which ATP supply and demand remain
closely coupled. During the ensuing "adaptation" phase,
a limited number of genes that encode for proteins whose
function is to ensure survival under oxygen limiting conditions are selectively expressed. Transcriptional activation of genes such as VEGF and GLUT1 by hypoxiainducible factor (HIF1) is the best understood example of
the defense mechanisms utilized during this adaptation
phase [5]. Thus, successful adaptation to hypoxia requires
both metabolic changes that control bioenergetics and
transcriptional activation of selected hypoxia rescue
genes.
The presence of necrosis, and by inference, hypoxia, is a
pathognomonic feature of human GBM tumors [6]. GBM
model systems have been developed to investigate the
mechanisms by which these tumor cells adapt to and survive under hypoxic conditions. A cardinal feature of
hypoxia-tolerant GBM cells is their ability to significantly
reduce their rate of oxygen consumption and preserve clonogenic potential when incubated under moderately
hypoxic conditions [7]. In contrast, hypoxia-sensitive
GBM cells maintain a steady oxygen consumption rate
under oxygen limiting conditions, yet show a reduced clonogenic survival. In this regard, hypoxia-tolerant cells
show several characteristics common to hypoxia-tolerant
vertebrates as they have an effective oxygen sensing mech-

anism and the ability to consolidate hypoxia rescue mechanisms. Interestingly, hypoxia-tolerant and -sensitive
GBM cells also display notable differences in mitochondrial function as exemplified by the ability of hypoxia-tolerant cells to stabilize mitochondria membrane potential
and preserve intracellular ATP under hypoxic conditions
and their relatively greater sensitivity to mitochondrial
poisons [8]. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that control of respiration and energy production are
essential hypoxia adaptation mechanisms in human
tumors.
In eukaryotic cells, mitochondria are the site of energy
production and ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The OXPHOS system consists of multiple carriers and molecules collectively referred to as the
electron transport chain (ETC), including electron acceptors, coenzyme Q, cytochrome c, and five multiprotein
complexes designated as Complexes I – V [9]. Oxidation
of fuel molecules produces NADH and FADH2, and electrons generated from NADH/FADH2 are transferred
between Complexes I – IV to molecular oxygen, the final
electron acceptor. The transfer of electrons releases energy
that is stored in the form of a proton gradient across the
mitochondrial membrane, and this energy is used to produce ATP. Individual cells contain many mitochondria
(e.g., ~1500 in a liver cell), and each mitochondrion has
hundreds to thousands of DNA molecules. mtDNA is a
circular, intronless molecule ~16.6 kb in size that encodes
13 polypeptide components of the ETC, 22 tRNAs and 2
rRNAs [10]. mtDNA has a higher mutation rate than
nuclear DNA (nDNA) as the mtDNA molecule is not protected by histones, is exposed to reactive oxygen species
generated during oxidative phosphorylation, and is replicated by DNA pol-γ that copies with low fidelity due to the
absence of a proof-reading function [11]. Deletions or
mutations in mtDNA underlie several complex human
disorders [e.g., MELAS Syndrome, Leber's hereditary optic
neuropathy (LHON)], the pathophysiology of which
includes alterations in mitochondrial bioenergetics [10].
Among patients with mtDNA-associated syndromes,
Complex I deficiency is also the most common disorder
[12], and of the several documented mtDNA Complex I
mutations, most are associated with LHON or LHONassociated syndromes [13,14].
Recently, human tumors of a variety of histopathological
types, including GBM [11], have been reported to harbor
mtDNA mutations [15,16]. In human tumor mtDNA,
both the non-coding D-loop region and Complex I are
mutational hotspots [15,17], with mutations that result in
coding changes most frequently observed in Complex I
[18,19]. Most human tumors show homoplasmic mutations, i.e., the same mutations are present in all mitochondria in all cells of the tumor [20]. It is well established that

Table 1: mtDNA Sequence Analysis of Human GBM Cells. The mtDNA of hypoxia-tolerant (M006x, M006xLo, M059K) and hypoxiasensitive (M010b) GBM cells was sequenced. Sequences that differ from the Cambridge sequence were checked against databases of
known sequence polymorphisms available on the MITOMAP website [23]. A previously unreported mutation (T14634C) in the ND6
subunit of M010b cells was discovered. (insert C = a single "C" inserted into the D-loop poly-C tract; n.c. = no amino acid change; poly

certain nuclear DNA mutations provide a selective advantage or are associated with tumor progression, thus, it is
reasonable to postulate that similar principles may apply
to mutations in mtDNA. At the present time, there is virtually no information about which, if any, mtDNA mutations are of functional importance in human tumors.
Nonetheless, mtDNA mutations hold the promise of
being useful clinical markers in the diagnosis and clinical
management of cancer patients.
As previous results indicated that differences in mitochondrial function exist among hypoxia-tolerant and -sensitive
human tumor cells, we investigated whether alterations to
the mtDNA underlie differences in the metabolic
response to hypoxia. We sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome in four GBM cell lines and identified several
known polymorphisms and an unreported transition
mutation (T14634C) in the hypoxia-sensitive cell line,
M010b. The T14634C mutation results in a single amino
acid (M64V) change in the gene encoding the ND6 subunit of Complex I. This mutation does not alter ND6 protein expression or mtDNA mass in M010b cells. However,
Complex I function is altered as M010b cells are significantly more resistant to both rotenone [8], an agent used

to screen Complex I mutations [21], and adriamycin, a
chemotherapeutic drug activated by Complex I redox
cycling [22]. Homology-based modelling and computational molecular biology was used to predict the 3D structures of the wild type and mutated ND6 proteins and
interactions of their helices and amino acids. The
T14634C mutation alters the structure and orientation of
the trans-membrane helices of the ND6 subunit. The finding that mitochondrial membrane potential, which is a
measure of total proton flux in the ETC, is dysregulated in
M010b cells under hypoxic conditions [8] is consistent
with this hypothesis and the modelling predictions. Thus,
this mutation provides a link to the defective respiratory
control in M010b cells in response to hypoxia as models
suggest that mtDNA-encoded, membrane-embedded
Complex I ND subunits function in proton translocation,
and cellular respiration is regulated, in part, by proton
flux. Hypoxia-sensitive M010b cells do not inhibit respiration in response hypoxic challenge. As this characteristic
makes them vulnerable hypoxic stress, determination of
the underlying mechanism may lead to the development
of strategies that could be used to induce this condition in
hypoxia-tolerant human tumor cells.

Results
Mutation Analysis
The sequence of the mitochondrial genome (13 coding
genes plus the D-loop regulatory region) of hypoxia-tolerant (M006x, M006xLo, M059K) and -sensitive (M010b)
GBM cells was determined using automated analysis and
primers previously published [16]. Sequence alterations
that differ from the Cambridge sequence were checked
against databases of known sequence polymorphisms
available on the MITOMAP website [23]. A total of 23 different sequence changes were identified, some of which
were found in more than one cell line, for a total of 44
alterations (Table 1). Of these, 39 were base pair changes,
and five were insertions of a single nucleotide. Of the 23
sequence alterations, 19 were previously reported polymorphisms, 1 was an unreported polymorphism that
does not result in an amino acid change, 2 were previously
unreported alterations in the non-coding D-loop, and 1
was an unreported mutation. This mutation in M010b
cells was a T-C transition in base pair 14634 that results in
a single amino acid change (met → val) in the gene encoding the ND6 subunit of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (OXPHOS Complex I).
mtDNA Copy Number
We used a PCR-based assay to test whether the ND6 mutation in M010b cells resulted in relatively increased mitochondrial mass [24]. The relative copy number of mtDNA
in GBM cells lines and normal human fibroblasts was
determined by generating standard curves to compare the
amount of product amplified from a region of the mtDNA
cytochrome b gene to that of an internal standard corresponding to products amplified from a segment of the
nuclear DNA β-actin gene in the same DNA isolation (Fig.
1A). Results indicated that normal human fibroblasts
have ~1000-fold greater number of mtDNA copies as
compared to the diploid nuclear genome. The relative
mtDNA content of GBM cells was also greater than that of
their respective nuclear genomes, with ~20- to ~250-fold
greater numbers of mtDNA copies. Of interest, the relative
mtDNA copy number of M010b cells carrying the ND6
mutation was not significantly greater than that of other
GBM cell lines with wild type ND6.
mtDNA Translation Products
As ND6 mutations have been reported previously to result
in a near absence of the protein [21], we tested whether
M010b cells with the T14634C ND6 mutation expressed
ND6 protein. Mitochondrial translation products were
labeled in vivo and separated using high-resolution polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [25]. Identification of individual proteins according to their gel migrations pattern is
facilitated by the fact that mtDNA has only 13 proteincoding genes. Analysis of newly synthesized mitochondrial proteins showed that the ND6 protein is expressed in

http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/3/1/19

M010b cells (Fig. 1B), suggesting that this mutation does
not result in a truncated or unstable polypeptide.
Complex I Activity
A flow cytometric assay [26] was used to compare overall
Complex I activity of normal human fibroblasts (GM38)
and hypoxia-tolerant (M006x, M006xLo, M059K) and sensitive (M010b) GBM cells. In this assay, cells with
severe Complex I deficiency will show a significant reduction in the relative ratio of dihydroethidium (DE) fluorescence after treatment with rotenone when compared to
normal controls. A one-way ANOVA test (Prism GraphPad data analysis software) was used to compare the
results of these five groups of cells. The results shown in
Fig. 2 indicate that there are no significant differences in
overall Complex I activity when M10b cells are compared
to normal fibroblasts or GBM cells lacking ND mutations
(p < 0.051; R2 = 0.28).
Cell Growth and Cytotoxicity
Cells with severe defects in oxidative phosphorylation fail
to grow in vitro when glucose in the medium is replaced
by galactose [27]. We used this screening system to test
whether the ND6 mutation in M010b cells was associated
with a significant respiratory chain defect. The growth of
M010b cells in media containing glucose or galactose as
substrates was analyzed using the nonlinear regression
curve fit function for exponential growth provided by
Prism GraphPad data analysis software (Fig. 3). The curve
fit function predicted a doubling time of 5.9 and 9.0 days
for glucose and galactose cultures, respectively. An F test
was used to compare the curves and test whether they
were different. The calculated p value was 0.012 from
which we conclude that the glucose and galactose curves
differ overall.

We next tested whether the ND6 mutation was associated
with altered sensitivity to adriamycin, a commonly used
chemotherapeutic agent that requires redox activation for
its cytotoxic effect. A MTT assay was used to compare the
cytotoxic effect of adriamycin on M010b cells vs. GBM
cells that show wild type ND6 (Fig. 4A). The data were
analyzed using the paired t-test function of the StatView
data analysis software program. M010b cells were significantly (p < 0.01) more resistant than M006x, M006xLo
and M059K cells to the cytotoxic effects of adriamycin
over the dose range of 0.5 – 50 µM.
Thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA) is a mitochondrial Complex II inhibitor [28]. We reasoned that if the ND6 mutation in M010b cells resulted in compensatory upregulation of Complex II activity, then M010b would be
more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of TTFA than GBM
cells with wild type ND6. However, no significant difference in sensitivity to TTFA was observed among the GBM

more reliant on electron transfer through Complex II.
HIF-1α Protein
The hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, HIF-1, is a heterodimer of HIF-1α and HIF-1β subunits. The HIF-1β subunit is constitutively expressed whereas the HIF-1α
protein is rapidly degraded under normoxic conditions
but is stable in hypoxia. This property suggests that HIF-1
may function as an oxygen sensor in coordinating transcriptional responses to hypoxic stress. We therefore
tested whether the hypoxia-sensitive phenotype of M010b
cells was, in part, a consequence of failure to stabilize HIF1α under hypoxic conditions. Western blot analysis
showed that HIF-1α protein stabilization in response to
hypoxia is not affected by the ND6 mutation (Fig. 5).
Under aerobic conditions, the HIF-1α protein is near
absent in both hypoxia-tolerant (M006x; ND6 wild type)
and -sensitive (M010b; ND6 mutant) cells. However,
when cells were maintained under physiologically relevant hypoxic conditions (0.6% O2), HIF-1α protein was
stabilized as indicated by detection of an band on western
blot probed with an antibody to HIF-1α. As expected, reoxygenation of previously hypoxic cells by transfer to
atmospheric oxygen concentrations (~18% O2) for 1 h
prior to protein harvest resulted in reduced HIF-1α protein levels as compared to that of fully hypoxic cells that
were not re-oxygenated.

Homology-Based Modeling of ND6 Protein
Homology-based modelling and computational chemistry were used to obtain a homology-based model of
human ND6 and its mutations. (Additional file 1 provides details of methodology used to model the probable
interactions and structure of key residues involved in the
maintenance of the 3D structure of the human ND6 protein and its mutations. References to the GROMACS 3.0
modeling package are provided.) Prediction of the secondary structure of the human ND6 protein indicated six
possible hydrophobic domains (putative hydrophobic
TMHs) that connected to each other by five loops (two
external loops and three internal loops) (Fig. 6A). This is
consistent with models reported by others [29]. The first
transmembrane helix, TMH I is the shortest helix and
TMH V is the longest one. The first internal loop, IL I, (the
longest extramembrane random coil) is divided into two
anti-parallel beta-sheet structures by a short random coil.
The interaction of ND6 with a small protein B18 (NADHubiqinone oxidoreductase B18 subunit) [30] may explain
the short length of TMH I and special structure of IL I.

The secondary structures predicted for the complete normal and three mutated ND6 proteins are shown in Fig. 6B.
(Additional file 2 provides the secondary structure predicted for the normal human ND6 protein. The positions
of mutated amino acids are indicated. Additional file 3

tional file 4. (Additional file 4 also summarizes the hydrogen bonding pattern that directly affect the 3D structure of
TMH V.) Based on the 3D-model of human ND6 and phylogenetic relations between its close sequence homologues, the residue's variety at each position of the
multiple sequence alignment, and also the normalized
conservation scores or the averaged conservation index,
TMH V and the ELII have the least average conservation
scores. Calculations of the non-covalent amino acid interactions and the interactions patterns of the 3D structures
of the normal protein and its mutants showed that these
two regions, as well as TMH I, BT I and TMH IV, likely
have functionally important roles in the maintenance of
secondary and tertiary structure of the protein and thus
may directly influence protein function.

Homology-based modeling of ND6 proteins
Homology-based modeling of ND6 proteins. Homology-based modeling of normal and mutated ND6 3D protein
structures. By comparison to the predicted 3D structure of
the normal ND6 protein, these models predict that the
M14V mutation in M010b cells, the M64V mutation in
LHON, and the A72V mutation in LHON would significantly
disrupt the orientation of the entire ND6 protein within the
mitochondrial membrane, and would alter the interactions of
the individual helices of each protein.

To validate our computational approach, the same parameters were used to predict the structural consequences of
two LHON mutations: 1) the M64V ND6 mutation that is
associated with degree of visual loss, and 2) the A72V
mutation that is more severe, leading to early onset blindness in all affected individuals. The multiple alignment
results showed that the most important differences
between family members occurred in TMH V and EL II.
This conclusion is based on calculations of 1) the 3Dmodel of the human ND6 protein and phylogenetic
relations between its close sequence homologues; 2) the
residues' variety at each position of the multiple sequence
alignment; and 3) the normalized conservation scores
(NCS) or averaged conservation index, as shown in Addi-

The refined 3D structures corresponding to the wild type
ND6 protein, the M14V mutation in M010b cell, and the
M64V and A72V mutations in LHON patients, are shown
in Fig. 7. Superimposition of the normal ND6 protein and
its pathogenic mutations showed disorientation and conformational changes in TMH V. The root mean square values of the superimposed 3D structures were calculated in
order to quantitate these changes. For the mutated ND6
proteins, these calculations showed significant changes in
the accessible surface area of the proteins as compared to
normal. (Additional file 5 shows root mean square values
of superimposed 3D structures of normal and mutated
ND6 proteins.) Interestingly, these changes were greatest
for the A72V mutation that is associated with the most
clinically severe LHON phenotype.

Discussion
Tumor cells that survive moderately hypoxic microenvironments are a source of treatment resistance and tumor
progression. Mitochondrial control of energy production
is an important component of hypoxia defense mechanisms as the ability to match ATP supply and demand
under oxygen limiting conditions is a general feature of
hypoxia tolerant organisms [4]. Consistent with this,
previous work has demonstrated that hypoxia-sensitive
GBM cells lack the ability to stabilize mitochondria membrane potential and preserve intracellular ATP under
hypoxic conditions [8]. Dysregulation of bioenergentics is
also a hallmark of multi-system syndromes such as LHON
or MELAS in which mtDNA is mutated. Based on this evidence, we wished to determine whether mtDNA mutations underlie the differential sensitivity to hypoxia
previously observed in GBM cells. We sequenced the
mitochondrial genome of four human GBM cells and
identified a mutation (T14634C) in the ND6 subunit of
NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex I) in the
hypoxia-sensitive cell line, M010b. Search of databases
available on the MitoMap website [23] indicate that this
mutation that has not been previously reported.

Complex I is a large (~1 million Da) multimeric complex
comprised of at least 43 subunits, 7 of which (ND1-6, and
4L) are encoded by the mtDNA. Complex I proteins
assemble into an L-shaped structure with the hydrophobic ND1–ND6 sub-units spanning the inner mitochondrial membrane and the nuclear encoded proteins
extending into the matrix space [31]. The transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone is catalyzed by Complex
I, and the free energy released by this process is used to
pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane
to the cytoplasm, thus establishing an electrochemical
gradient across the membrane. The function of the individual Complex I subunits is largely unknown, however,
the mtDNA-encoded, membrane-embedded subunits are
postulated to be involved in proton translocation [21,29].
The specific roles and exact locations of the ND subunits
within the membrane domain of Complex I are incompletely understood, however, biochemical studies suggest
that the ND6 subunit is located at or near the quinone
redox site within the hydrophobic transmembrane arm
[29,32]. We previously used specific inhibitors of mitochondrial Complexes I, III and IV, together with electron
transport chain uncouplers, to assess the activity of respiratory chain complexes in cells with (M010b) and without
(M006x) the T14634C mutation. These results have been
published [8] and showed that M010b cells are relatively
resistant to rotenone, an agent used to screen for Complex
I mutations, but are relatively sensitive to antimycin A, an
inhibitor that binds to the ubiquinone reduction site in
Complex III, and myxothiazol, an inhibitor of ubiquinol
oxidation. Together, these results are of particular interest
because they demonstrate that the ND6 mutation in
M010b cells is associated with a common phenotype previously described for three primary ND6 mutations in
LHON. In the case of the pathogenic LHON mutations,
cells samples did not show overall differences in Complex
I activity but did show Complex I defects that were
detected as changes in sensitivity to specific effectors of
Complex I quinone reactivity such as myxothiazol
[29,33,34]. Although the function of Complex I ND
subunits still remains unclear [35], together these findings
suggest that the ND6 protein contributes to the quinonebinding site of Complex I [33]. They also highlight the fact
that ND6 Complex I mutations are subtle and difficult to
detect solely by monitoring overall differences in Complex I activity.
In rodent cells, ND6 mutations can result in absence of
the cognate protein and failure to assemble the Complex
I membrane arm [14,21]. In contrast, the 14484 ND6
mutation in a LHON patient is associated with expression
of a mutated protein [33]. In the case of the T14634C
mutation reported here, analysis of mtDNA translation
products indicated that ND6 protein is present in M010b
cells. We therefore assessed possible effects of this muta-

tion on Complex I function by comparing the growth rate
of M010b cells maintained in medium containing either
glucose or galactose as carbon sources. This growth assay
is a technique commonly employed to screen fibroblasts
or lymphoblasts obtained from patients suspected to harbor respiratory chain defects [27]. When galactose
replaces glucose in cell culture medium, cellular ATP is
generated by mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate. Under
these conditions, cells with severe defects in mitochondrial
metabolism die within the first day of growth in galactosecontaining medium, whereas cells with mild defects
become detached and die within 3–4 days [27]. In the
case of M010b cells, the glucose vs. galactose growth
curves do differ overall, however, the curves do not begin
to diverge until day 5. This would suggest that the ND6
mutation confers a "subtle" Complex I defect. In nonmalignant tissues, mutations in mtDNA-encoded Complex I ND subunits are known to confer a broad range of
phenotyes [13]. In this regard, the phenotype associated
with the T14634C mutation in M010b cells (mutated
protein, subtle Complex I defect) is more similar to that
observed in a LHON patient with a 14488 ND6 mutation
[33] than it is to that observed in mutagenized rodent
cells.
To further test the functional significance of the ND6
mutation, we treated GBM cells with a drug that targets
Complex I. Adriamycin, a member of the anthracycline
class of anticancer drugs, is activated in mitochondria by
Complex I redox cycling between the quinone and the
semiquinone, which in the presence of oxygen, generates
ROS [22]. Tumor cells that lack Complex I activity as a
consequence of mtDNA deletions are resistant to adriamycin [36]. In this study, we tested a range of adriamycin
concentrations that included the peak plasma concentration (~2 µM) that that can be achieved after iv infusion
[37]. M010b cells were significantly more resistant to
adriamycin over a broad dose range (0.5 – 10 µM) when
compared to other GBM cells with wild type mtDNA
Complex I genes. Thus, Complex I mutations that frequently occur in human tumors have the potential to contribute to resistance to chemotherapeutic agents that
require redox cycling for their activation.
Both Complex I and Complex II can transfer electrons to
coenzyme Q, which then shuttles them to Complex III,
ultimately resulting in the production of ATP. To test
whether the ND6 mutation in Complex I resulted in a
compensatory up-regulation of Complex II activity, we
treated GBM cells with the Complex II inhibitor, TTFA.
M010b cells were not differentially sensitive to TTFA, suggesting that the ND6 mutation does not elicit a greater
reliance on Complex II activity for energy production.
Similarly, Barrientos and Moraes [38] demonstrated that
rotenone-induced Complex I deficiency did not increase

cells.

hypothesis awaits a high resolution crystal structure of
Complex I, or its individual ND subunits.

Mouse cells carrying ND6 mutations that result in complete absence of the protein show increased mtDNA copy
number, a phenomenon believed to reflect compensatory
mtDNA amplification [21]. Therefore, we used a PCRbased method to compare relative mtDNA copy number
in M010b cells, three GBM cells that lack this mutation,
and normal human fibroblasts. Normal fibroblasts show
~1000-fold greater mtDNA copy number as compared to
nuclear DNA, a finding consistent with the fact that mammalian cells contain of the order of thousands of mtDNA
molecules [24]. No evidence of increased mtDNA was
observed in M010b cells as compared to other GBM cell
lines. It is not possible to calculate total mtDNA copy
number for the GBM cell lines as they are aneuploid and
therefore may contain more than 2 copies of the nuclear
β-actin gene that was used as an internal standard. Nonetheless, the finding the relative mtDNA copy number of
M010b cells is similar to that of the other GBM cells is
consistent with our other data that indicates the T14634C
ND6 mutation confers a 'subtle' phenotype.

There is considerable interest in identifying the 'oxygen
sensor' both in normal tissues systems as well as tumors.
HIF-1 family of transcription factors up-regulates the
expression of a repertoire of hypoxia rescue genes whose
products permit cell survival under hypoxic condition [5].
Under aerobic conditions, the HIF-1α subunit is targeted
for proteasomal degradation by the dioxygenase, prolyl-4hydroxylase. In the absence of oxygen, prolyl-4-hydroxylase is inactive, the HIF-1α subunit is stabilized and subsequently activated by post-translational phosphorylation
events [43]. HIF-1α protein is also stabilized in response
to hormones, toxic metals and growth factors [44-46].
Although it has been postulated that hypoxia-independent stabilization of HIF-1α is mediated by production of
ROS, not all studies support a role for ROS in this process
[47]. As mtDNA mutations can alter ROS production, we
tested whether M010b cells would show HIF-1α stabilization at low oxygen concentrations. The hypoxic sensitivity
of M010b cells is manifest as a significant reduction in
clonogenic cell survival under physiologically relevant
hypoxic conditions [7]. Absence of HIF-1α stabilization,
and subsequent failure to transcriptionally activate the
expression of hypoxia rescue genes, would be consistent
with this phenotype. However, our results showed that
incubation of M010b cells in atmospheres of reduced oxygen tensions similar to those that can occur in human
tumors resulted in stabilization of HIF-1α protein. This is
consistent with previous findings that expression the HIF1 target gene, VEGF, is up-regulated in M010b cells in
response to hypoxia [7]. Together, these results suggest
that HIF-1α stabilization is a necessary but not sufficient
condition to ensure tumor cell survival in hypoxia. The
model of hypoxia defense mechanisms formalized by
Hochachka and colleagues [4] postulated that successful
hypoxia adaptation requires both the ability to activate
metabolic changes that link ATP demand to ATP supply
and to up-regulate a repertoire of hypoxia defense genes,
many of which are controlled at the transcriptional level
by HIF-1. Although M010b cells can stabilize HIF-1α protein and trans-activate target genes under hypoxic conditions, we postulate that they remain sensitive to hypoxia
due to an inability to modulate respiration and conserve
intracellular ATP stores [8].

Analysis of Complex I function has been largely focused
on electron transport activity, however, both bacterial and
eukaryotic Complex I transmembrane subunits are suggested to function as a conserved, conformation-driven
proton pump [39]. While details of the mechanisms regulating proton translocation remain controversial [40],
metabolic control analyses indicate that cellular
respiration is regulated, in part, by proton flux [41].
Recently, it has been shown that oxygen conformance
(i.e., the ability to decrease oxygen consumption rate
under hypoxic conditions) in hypoxia-tolerant cardiomyocytes is controlled, in part, by regulation of the rate of
proton leak [42]. Hypoxia-tolerant GBM cells also show
an oxygen conforming phenotype, whereas M010b cells
do not [7]. Together, these finding suggested that changes
in proton translocation arising from structural alterations
in ND subunit proteins might modify the control of
cellular respiration in response to hypoxic challenge. We
used homology-based modeling and computational
molecular biology to predict the 3D structure of the wild
type and mutated ND6 proteins. Our calculations showed
ND6 mutations confer potentially significant changes in
the accessible surface area of the proteins and orientation
of individual amino acids, the consequences of which are
reflected in a secondary structure perturbation from helix
to coil. Thus, the structural changes predicted to occur in
the ND6 subunit as a result of the T14634C mutation may
alter its proton conductance properties, and may ultimately contribute to the defective respiration control
observed in M010b cells. However, verification of this

While it is attractive to suggest a genetic link between the
Complex I ND6 T14634C mutation and the hypoxic sensitivity of M010b cell, it is inherently difficulty to assign a
single phenotype to a given mtDNA mutation as study of
mitochondrial diseases has shown that the same mtDNA
mutation can result in variable phenotypic expression
among different individuals or pedigrees [48]. As well, different mtDNA mutations can be associated with similar

Molecular Cancer 2004, 3:19

phenotypes [10]. For example, LHON is associated with
mutations in ND1, ND4 and ND6 mtDNA genes [49]. We
postulate that a similar principle may apply in the case of
human tumors. Complex I is a mutational hotspot in
human tumor mtDNA. Thus, the T14634C mutation
reported here, or other ND subunit mutations the effect
changes in protein structure, might be associated with or
modulate tumor cell response to hypoxic stress.

Conclusions
We have identified a mutation (T14634C) in mtDNAencoded Complex I ND6 subunit that is associated with a
hypoxia-sensitive phenotype in the human glioma cell
line, M010b. M010b cells show mild Complex I deficiency and resistance to adriamycin. Homology-based
modelling predicts that this mutation disrupts the
conformation of the ND6 protein. As Complex I mtNDA
mutations are common among human tumors, further
analysis of their role in tumor response to hypoxia would
be of value.

Methods
Cell lines
The origin of the GBM cell lines used in this study has
been previously described [50,51]. The M010b, M006 and
M059K cell lines were derived directly from GBM tumor
resections. The M006x cell line was derived from a M006
tumor xenograft. The M006xLo cell line was derived by
incubating M006x cells at 0.6% oxygen for two weeks.
GM38 cells are a normal human fibroblast strain. All cell
lines were cultured in DMEM/F12 media supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% L-glutamine.
Muatation analysis
Total DNA was isolated from M006x, M006xLo, M059K
and M010b cells using a standard phenol/chloroform
extraction procedure. The mtDNA was amplified using
seven different 1–3 kb overlapping fragments to eliminate
the possibility of amplifying nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes [16]. The 13 mitochondrial coding genes plus the
D-loop regulatory region were sequenced using primers
previously published [16] and an ABI Prism Big Dye II
Terminator mix. The sequence of the GBM cell lines was
compared to the normal "Cambridge sequence" and deviations from normal were analyzed using the MitoAnalyzer
computer program provided on the Mitomap website
[23]. Genetic alterations identified by sequencing were
checked against databases of previously reported polymorphisms maintained on the Mitomap website. These
were MITOMAP: MtDNA Coding Region Sequence Polymorphisms and MITOMAP: MtDNA Control Region (DLoop) Sequence Polymorphisms. Complete references for
all previously reported polymorphisms are provided by
direct links from the databases. Mutations not previously
reported were re-sequenced using different PCR fragments

Mitochondrial Translation Products
Mitochondrial protein synthesis was analyzed according
to Chomyn [25]. Briefly, M010b cells (6 × 105) were
seeded onto 10 cm plates, incubated for five days to 80–
90% confluence, washed with methionine/cysteine-free
DMEM and then incubated for 15 min in the same
medium containing emetine (100 µg/ml), a cytoplasmic
translation inhibitor. 35S-methionine/cysteine (7.15 mCi;
>1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham) was then added (0.2 mCi/
ml) and the cells incubated for an additional 2 h. The
labelled cells were then washed, scraped off and lysed in
1% RIPA buffer (1% NP40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1%
SDS). Protein samples (10 µg) were electrophoresed
through an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10–20% gradient).
The gel was then fixed, dried, and the electrophoretic pattern of mitochondrial proteins visualized using autoradiography film. The ND6 subunit was identified by its
relative position within the migration pattern of the 13
mtDNA encoded proteins.
mtDNA Copy Number
mtDNA copy number was measured by a PCR-based assay
that uses the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene as a marker
of the entire mtDNA genome [24]. DNA was harvested
from confluent cultures of M059K, M006x, M006xLo,
M010b, and GM38 cells using the DNeasy tissue kit
(Qiagen). The DNA was quantified by spectrophotometry. Serial dilutions (2-2–2-16) were made for each DNA
sample, starting with 25 ng of DNA. A region of the mitochondrion-encoded cytochrome b gene was amplified from
the serially diluted template DNA using primers F41 and
R29 as described by Polyak et al. [16]. β-actin was amplified as a control, using the primers BA-67 and BA-68 as
described by Horikoshi et al. [53]. PCR conditions were as
follows: 1X PCR buffer (Amersham Biosciences), 0.34
mM MgCl2, 0.1 µM forward primer, 0.1 µM reverse
primer, 0.4 mM dNTPs, and 0.02 units/µL Taq polymerase (Amersham Biosciences). The following cycling conditions were used: 95°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of:
50 sec at 95°C, 50 sec at 57°C, 50 sec at 72°C, with a final
extension of 5 min at 72°C. Electrophoresis of PCR products was performed on 1% agarose gels; PCR products
were then stained with ethidium bromide. Quantitation
was performed using the Typhoon 9400 imager and
ImageQuant software (Amersham Pharmacia). Standard
curves derived from three or more experiments were analyzed using the linear regression curve fit function provided by Prism GraphPad data analysis software.
Complex I Activity
A flow cytometric assay was used to screen for defects in
overall Complex I activity [26]. Briefly, cells were grown

Molecular Cancer 2004, 3:19

DMEM/F12 culture medium supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum until plates reached ~90% confluency.
Cells were then washed with PBS and placed in serum-free
medium for 24 h. Cells were then washed with PBS,
trypsinized, counted and divided into aliquots of 106
cells. Rotenone (20 µM) was then added for 30 min to
inhibit respiratory chain activity. Control cells were incubated in PBS alone. Control and rotenone-treated cells
were then washed, resuspended in PBS containing dihyroethidium (DE) (Molecular Probes, 10 µM final concentration), and incubated at room temperature for 15 min.
Cells were then immediately analyzed by flow cytometry
using a FACSort flow cytometer. At least 10,000 gated cells
were counted and the mean FL3 fluoresence peak was calculated. Relative fluorescence ratios were calculated by
dividing the mean level of FL3 fluoresence of DE plus
rotenone treated cells by that of cells treated with DE
alone. Results for each cell line were based on the mean ±
s.d. of five or more separate experiments.
Cell Growth Assays
A technique described by Robinson [27] was used to
screen M010b cells for respiratory chain defects. Briefly,
cells (1.5 × 104/well) were seeded into six well tissue culture plates in DMEM medium containing either 10 mM
glucose or 5 mM galactose as substrates. At daily intervals
(day 1–8), replicate plates were trypsinized and cell
counts determined using an electronic particle counter
(Coulter). Growth curves determined for each cell line
were based on the mean ± s.d. of three replicate
experiments.
Cytotoxicity Assays
Cells were seeded in 96 well plates (2 × 104 cells/well) and
allowed to adhere for 24 h. Serial dilutions of adriamycin
(0.5 – 50 µM) or TTFA (25 – 5000 µM) were then added,
cells returned to the incubator for 96 h after which the
spent media was replaced with 200 µl of fresh media containing MTT (500 µg/ml) [54]. The cells were incubated
for an additional 4 h, then lysed with 40% formalin/20%
SDS, and viability was determined using a plate reader set
to record absorbance at 600 – 660 nm.
HIF-1α Protein Expression
Preparation of whole cell lysates and Western blotting
analysis were as previously described [55]. For this study,
cells were seeded onto 60 mm glass plates (2 × 105/plate)
in complete medium and incubated under normoxic conditions (18% O2; 5% CO2) in a standard tissue culture
incubator, or in specially designed leak-proof aluminum
chambers [56] that maintained an atmosphere of 0.6%
O2; 5% CO2; balance N2 at 37°C. Aerobic cells were lysed
24 h later under ambient conditions. To maintain hypoxic
conditions, cylinders containing the hypoxic cells were
transferred to a specially designed glove box (PlasLabs) in

http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/3/1/19

which an atmosphere of 1% O2 was maintained. The cylinders were then opened, the plates removed and cells
lysed while in an oxygen-reduced atmosphere. To
simulate re-oxygenation, a second set of cylinders containing hypoxic cells was opened under ambient conditions and then placed in a standard incubator for 1 h prior
to lysis under ambient conditions. HIF-1α protein expression was detected by chemiluminescence using a HIF-1α
primary antibody (Novus Biologicals), followed by a
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody.
Homology-Based Modeling of ND6
The refined three-dimensional structures of bacteriorhodopsin, as a template for modeling studies of membranebound proteins, were obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Databank [PDB Entry 1M0L [57] resolution of 1.47 Å
and 1C3W [58], resolution of 1.55 Å]. The primary structure of the human NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase
(Complex I) [59,60] and its mutations [61-67], were
obtained
from
the
Swiss-Prot
databank
(NU6M_HUMAN, Entry P03923).

The multiple alignment between NU6M family, extracted
from the PSI-BLAST [68] output, was performed with the
CLUSTAL W [69] method (with default parameters) as
implemented in the ConSurf (surface-mapping of phylogenetic information using "Maximum Likelihood" paradigm) [70], and also with the Lipman-Pearson method
[71], by using the Dayhoff Similarity Table [72] as
implemented in the MULTALIN [73] software. We used
several 'Gap Penalties' in the latter method to obtain an
optimal alignment, and finally the comparisons were
refined manually. In overall view, the alignments were
generated on the basis of residue identity, homology
parameters and conservation patterns [74,75].
Because of the location of the ND6 protein and its special
topology, the prediction of the secondary structure and
hydropathy plot of human ND6 was performed with several methods and scales [58,70,71,74-82], and finally
with manual refinement with attention to overall topology and alignment result.
The MODELLER [83] software was used in order to obtain
a homology-based model of human ND6 and its mutations from the bacteriorhodopsin structure by changing
the side chains of those residues whose predicted
secondary structures were similar to those of the corresponding residues of bacteriorhodopsin. The handling
and visualization of the 3D molecular structure and the
construction of missing H-atoms were accomplished with
molecular modeling Swiss-PdbViewer [84] software.
Details of the procedures used for molecular dynamics
and molecular mechanics simulations [85,86] are provided in the supplementary material.

We studied the ND6 protein and eight pathogenic mutations in two forms: 1) only TMHs of the protein and 2) a
complete model of the protein: N-terminal and C-Terminal, loops and TMHs. We constructed models for the following forms of ND6: 1) normal ND6 protein; 2) possible
primary mutation (M14V) in M010b cells; 3) possible
rare primary mutation (I26M) in LHON [61]; 4) possible
rare primary mutation (G36S) in LHON [67]; 5) possible
rare primary mutation (Y59C) in LHON [65]; 6) possible
rare primary mutation (M64I) in LHON [64,66]; 7) primary mutation (M64V) in LHON characterized by visual
loss in both eyes, from which ~50% of those affected
recover visual function [64,66]; 8) primary rare and more
severe mutation (A72V) in LHON characterized by no
recovery from blindness [62]; and 9) possible primary
mutation: (Y165C) [63]. From this framework and with
attention to rapid structure generation and high-volume
protein preparation in structural proteomics studies, we
used HOME_MODELLER and HOME_OPTIMIZER, two
simple and user-friendly Perl multi-optional command
line scripts on the basis of MODELLER [83] and
GROMACS [86] packages, prepared to accept primary
sequence of a protein, as an input, and automatically produce fully refined and minimized 3D model(s) of protein,
as an output.
