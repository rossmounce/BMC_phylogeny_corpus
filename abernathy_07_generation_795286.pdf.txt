Abstract
Background: The ciliate protozoan Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (Ich) is an important parasite of
freshwater fish that causes 'white spot disease' leading to significant losses. A genomic resource for
large-scale studies of this parasite has been lacking. To study gene expression involved in Ich
pathogenesis and virulence, our goal was to generate expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for the
development of a powerful microarray platform for the analysis of global gene expression in this
species. Here, we initiated a project to sequence and analyze over 10,000 ESTs.
Results: We sequenced 10,368 EST clones using a normalized cDNA library made from pooled
samples of the trophont, tomont, and theront life-cycle stages, and generated 9,769 sequences
(94.2% success rate). Post-sequencing processing led to 8,432 high quality sequences. Clustering
analysis of these ESTs allowed identification of 4,706 unique sequences containing 976 contigs and
3,730 singletons. These unique sequences represent over two million base pairs (~10% of
Plasmodium falciparum genome, a phylogenetically related protozoan). BLASTX searches produced
2,518 significant (E-value < 10-5) hits and further Gene Ontology (GO) analysis annotated 1,008 of
these genes. The ESTs were analyzed comparatively against the genomes of the related protozoa
Tetrahymena thermophila and P. falciparum, allowing putative identification of additional genes. All the
EST sequences were deposited by dbEST in GenBank (GenBank: EG957858–EG966289). Gene
discovery and annotations are presented and discussed.
Conclusion: This set of ESTs represents a significant proportion of the Ich transcriptome, and
provides a material basis for the development of microarrays useful for gene expression studies
concerning Ich development, pathogenesis, and virulence.

Background
The ciliate protozoan Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (Ich)is one
of the most devastating pathogens. It infects fish skin and

gills, and causes white spot diseases in many species of
freshwater fish worldwide, which leads to significant
losses in the aquaculture industry. The ciliate parasite has

three main life-cycle stages: the reproductive tomont, the
infective theront, and a parasitic trophont [1-3]. The
mature trophont drops off the host to become the tomont
where it attaches to a substrate, and undergoes multiple
divisions to produce hundreds to thousands of tomites
within a cyst. Tomites bore their way through the cyst into
water, and differentiate into theronts that infect fish. Once
they burrow into the fish epithelium, theronts become
trophonts that feed and mature in the host.
In spite of great losses caused by Ich to the aquaculture
industry, molecular studies of the parasite have been
scarce [see a recent review [4]]. Limited studies have concentrated on immune responses of the host and factors
affecting them [5-11]. One of the difficulties for the studies of Ich is the problem involved in long-term maintenance of Ich isolates. Ich isolates appear to lose infectivity
or become senescent after a certain number of passages
[12-15]. Most often a significant decrease in infectivity is
observed after about 50 passages [15]. Not only the infectivity decreases with higher numbers of passages, but also
the development of the parasite as measured by the period
required for trophonts to emerge from fish [15].
The Ich senescence phenomenon is interesting not only as
a developmental biology issue, but also as a potential
research system to study the virulence factors involved in
the parasite pathogenesis. Assuming the life cycles of Ich
and its infectivity are controlled by gene products, then it
would be of great interest to learn what genes are involved
in the loss of infectivity, and in the slowing down of its
development. However, as very limited molecular information is available from Ich, in-depth research is limited
by the lack of information and the lack of genomic
resources.
EST analysis is one of the most effective means for gene
discoveries, gene expression profiling, and functional
genome studies [16-23]. It is also one of the most efficient
ways for the identification of differentially expressed
genes [24-28]. In order to provide genomic resources for
the analysis of differentially expressed genes at different
developmental stages of the Ich parasite, and for the analysis of genes differentially expressed when infectivity is
being lost, the objectives of this study were to create cDNA
libraries suitable for the analysis of expressed sequence
tags (ESTs) and to generate an EST resource for Ich to
allow cDNA-based design of microarrays for the study of
gene expression in relation to the passages and development of the parasite. Before this work, there were only 511
Ich sequences in the GenBank dbEST (release 100606)
[29]. A brief examination of these existing EST sequences
indicated that a large proportion of them were trophont
only reads, histones, ribosomal proteins, and immobilization antigen-related sequences. Here we report sequenc-

ing of 10,368 Ich EST clones, and generation of 8,432
high quality EST sequences. This EST resource should provide the material basis for the development of microarrays
for Ich, and serve as a platform for its functional genomic
studies including the development and pathogenesis of
Ich, and the host-parasite interactions.

Results and Discussion
Generation of the Ich ESTs
As summarized in Table 1, a total of 10,368 clones were
sequenced from a normalized Ich library made from
pooled cells from all three life cycle stages: theront,
tomont, and trophont. Readable sequences were generated with 9,769 clones (94.2% sequencing success rate).
After base calling, sequences were processed by using
Phred [30,31] to eliminate low quality sequences below
Q20. Sequences passing Q20 were uploaded into Vector
NTI Advance 10 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for vector
trimming and removal of sequences with very short
inserts (<100 bp). The post-sequencing processing
resulted in 8,432 high quality sequences.

The processed sequences were subjected to cluster analysis
using Vector NTI to evaluate sequence redundancies. Of
the 8,432 sequences, 4,702 sequences fell within 976 contigs while 3,730 sequences were singletons. On average,
each contig contained 4.8 sequences. Taken together, the
976 contigs and the 3,730 singletons made up 4,706
unique sequences (Table 1).
The Ich genome expression appeared to be extremely
polarized with a few genes expressed at very high levels. In
spite of normalization, transcripts from a few genes were
sequenced at very high frequencies. The top 20 contigs
with the largest number of ESTs are summarized in Table
2. Of the top 20 most abundantly sequenced transcripts,
four of them were detected over 0.5% of total sequences.
Of these, the most abundantly sequenced EST cluster,
cluster 276 with 764 ESTs, accounted for 7.36% of all
sequenced clones. BLASTX searches indicated that this
transcript was most similar to a hypothetical protein,
TTHERM_02141640, from Tetrahymena thermophila. The
second most abundantly sequenced transcript was cluster
60 with 119 ESTs. It was identified as a transcript most
similar to a hypothetical protein, TTHERM_02641280,
from T. thermophila. The functions of these hypothetical
proteins are unknown at present. These are two transcripts
sequenced at exceptionally high frequencies. Obviously,
the presence of such abundant transcripts suggested a failure in the normalization processes. However, it is puzzling to us because we believe the overall normalization
processes may have worked based on several other observations: 1) the overall gene discovery rate (unique
sequences over all sequences analyzed) was 55.8%, a reasonable rate for the sequencing depth of approximately

10,000 clones; 2) most other anticipated highly expressed
genes such as ribosomal protein genes, actin genes, tubulin genes, and dynein genes were not detected at high levels. Nonetheless, we believe that this information is
relevant and important as these genes should be the subject for additional subtraction for further EST sequencing
in this species. In addition, such information should provide some basic picture about the most abundantly
expressed genes in the parasite. As these hypothetical protein genes are transcribed at such high levels, they may be
crucially important for the growth and development, or
other life-cycle processes of the parasite.
This work demonstrated that pooling of samples from all
three stages of Ich life cycle followed by normalization
was an effective way to reduce common messages across
all three life stages. As one would expect, many structural
genes would be expressed highly abundantly in all stages
of the life cycle. In addition to making savings economically, pooling of samples allowed very effective normalization of these common transcripts without going
through three rounds of normalization. This is consistent
with our previous experience for the generation of a large
number of catfish and oyster ESTs [32-36]. It is obvious
that the pooling of samples from three developmental
stages made it impossible to provide information concerning expression profiling in relation to developmental
stages. However, such information would not be highly
meaningful in normalized cDNA libraries where the
major focus was to develop EST resources, rather than
expression profiling. The other limitation caused by construction of a pooled cDNA library is the loss of sequencing flexibility as to the number of clones to be sequenced
from each developmental stage library if they had been
separately constructed.
The Ich transcribed sequences are highly A/T-rich, similar
to the situation in T. thermophila. Our unique sequences
combined contain 2.18 megabases, approximately 10%

of the genomic sequence size of the related protozoan
Plasmodium falciparum, and 2.1% of the T. thermophila
genomic sequence. As Ich is a ciliate and most closely
related to Tetrahymena, this EST resource should represent
a good sample of the transcribed fraction of the Ich
genome for the estimation of its genome contents as compared with Tetrahymena. Based on the EST sequences, the
average G+C content of Ich transcribed sequences was
found to be 33.4%, even more A/T-rich than those of the
closely related hymenostome T. thermophila, which has an
average G+C content of 38% at protein coding regions
[37]. The entire genome of T. thermophila was much more
A/T-rich than the transcribed fraction, with a G+C content
of only 22% [38]. It is highly probable that the Ich
genome is also highly A/T-rich. To further the analysis, we
found approximately 1% of the unique ESTs sequenced
contained simple sequence repeats. The majority of the
simple sequence repeats were of di-nucleotide repeats
(68.8%) with AC and AG repeats being the majority. Trinucleotide and tetra-nucleotide repeats accounted for
23.7% and 7.5% of the identified microsatellites, respectively (Table 3).
The putative identities of the sequenced ESTs were
assessed using BLASTX searches against the non-redundant (NR) database in GenBank [39]. All the search results
are summarized in supplemental Table 1. Of the 4,706
unique ESTs, 2,518 (53.5%) had significant (E-value < 105) hits. The remaining 2,188 (46.5%) EST sequences were
not similar to any known sequences. Additional searches
using the Swiss-Prot database resulted in putative identities for six additional unknown ESTs (Supplemental Table
1).
Identification of putative secretory proteins
Secretory proteins have been shown to be an important
component in many biological processes, including
pathogenesis of parasites [40-42]. We therefore searched
for transcripts with putative signal peptides (suggestive of

peptides of secretory proteins) within the EST set using the
program SignalP 3.0 [43]. We found 314 ESTs with signal
peptides, representing 6.7% of the unique sequences. Of
these, 180 (3.8%) were from ESTs with no significant (Evalue < 10-5) BLASTX hit to the NR database in GenBank
(Supplemental Table 1).
Comparative analysis to related taxa
The parasite Ich is phylogenetically placed between the
protozoan's Plasmodium falciparum and Tetrahymena thermophila. Previous studies using 18S rDNA, histone genes,
and I-antigens [44-46] suggested that Ich was more related
to T. thermophila than to P. falciparum. Furthermore, T.
thermophila and Ich share the ciliate nuclear genetic code,
while P. falciparum uses the standard genetic code for
translation. As the entire genome sequence of P. falci-

parum is available and the macronuclear sequencing
project of T. thermophila was just recently completed, we
made comparative BLAST analyses against both genome
sequences.
The tBLASTx or BLASTX searches of Ich ESTs against the T.
thermophila and P. falciparum genomes are summarized in
Supplemental Table 2, and are presented in Figure 1. As
expected based on the phylogenetic relationships, more
Ich ESTs were similar to the genome sequences of T. Thermophila than to that of P. falciparum. Of the 4,706 Ich
ESTs, 1,759 sequences were similar (E-value < 10-5) to the
T. thermophila genome sequences; whereas 817 were similar to the P. falciparum genome sequences. In total, 695
ESTs were similar to both T. thermophila and P. falciparum
genomes, and thus are common to all three protists.

genomes. A total of 4,706 unique Ich ESTs were used as queries yielding 1,759 significant (E-value < 10-5) hits to the T.
thermophila genome, and 817 to the P. falciparum genome. A
total of 695 sequences were ESTs with common hits to both
genomes.
Of the 1,759 significant hits against the T. thermophila
genome, 1,673 had been identified with a putative identity using BLASTX searches against the NR database, while
the tBLASTx searches against the T. thermophila genome
allowed identification of putative identities for additional
86 unique ESTs. Similarly, BLASTX searches against the P.
falciparum genome allowed identification of 9 additional
ESTs. Taken together, the BLAST searches against these
two genomes allowed putative identities of 95 additional
unique ESTs, bringing the total number of ESTs with significant similarities to known genes to 2,613.
Such genome searches also revealed that of the 2,518 ESTs
that had significant hits in BLASTX searches against the
NR database, 845 had no significant hits to the Tetrahymena genome. Clearly, these ESTs were similar to
sequences of organisms other than the ciliate Tetrahymena.
These results clearly suggest conservation of a large fraction of gene sequences among the three protozoa parasites, with a higher level of conservation between Ich and
the T. thermophila genome than between the Ich genome
and the P. falciparum genome; although a significant fraction of gene sequences are also shared between the
genomes of T. thermophila and P. falciparum. The results of
this comparative analysis are compatible with existing
phylogenetic analyses using several molecular markers

such as the 18S rDNA, histone genes, and the I-antigens.
Obviously, use of a large set of sequences should provide
a greater confidence concerning genome evolution. The
comparative analysis suggested that the EST resource generated from this study should be useful for phylogenetic
analysis and studies concerning genome evolution.
Gene ontology
The unique Ich sequences were compared to annotations
through the Gene Ontology Consortium [47] using the
automated software Blast2GO [48]. We were able to
obtain GO terms for 1,008 unique sequences using this
method. Of these, 304 were contigs and 704 were singletons. Sequence descriptions, gene ontology (GO) and
enzyme commission (EC) numbers are summarized in
Supplemental Table 3. There were 258 sequences with
both GO terms and EC numbers.

Gene ontology graphs using percentages of 2nd level GO
terms are presented in Figure 2 under the categories of cellular components (Fig. 2A), molecular functions (Fig. 2B),
and biological processes (Fig. 2C). Of the cellular component GO terms, 45% and 26% were related directly with
cellular and organelle components, respectively. In the
category of molecular functions, the vast majority were
involved in catalytic activity (41%) and binding activities
(39%). Under the category of biological processes, 45%
were involved in physiological processes; 43% were
involved in cellular processes, 6% in regulation of biological processes, 4% in response to stimuli, and 2% in development (Figure 2).

Conclusion
We have produced 8,432 high quality I. multifiliis EST
sequences. Sequence analysis indicated the presence of
4,706 unique sequences in the EST set. This should represent a significant fraction of the Ich genes, although the
exact gene number of the parasite is unknown at present.
The majority of the unique EST sequences had similarities
to known genes, making them more amenable to functional analysis. The EST sequences should enhance the
effectiveness of molecular studies, especially for gene
expression profiling and the analysis of genes involved in
virulence and infectivity. Microarrays can now be
designed using either cDNA microarray or oligo-based
platforms using the EST information. Additionally, the
cluster and redundancy information should be useful for
further subtraction of the most abundant transcripts
included in the cDNA library, making further EST analysis
in the parasite more effective.

fish. The source of the original Ichthyophthirius multifiliis
was isolated from an infected fish obtained from a local
pet shop and the parasite was transmitted to channel catfish held in a 50-l glass aquarium at the USDA-ARS
Aquatic Animal Health Research Laboratory, Auburn, AL.
The transmission of I. multifiliis was achieved through cohabitation of the infected fish with two fingerlings of
channel catfish (3 inches in size). When the two catfish
were infected, the symptoms of Ich, white spots, started to
emerge when trophonts were collected by scraping with a
glass slide. Channel catfish infected with maturing trophonts were rinsed in dechlorinated water and the skin
was gently scraped to dislodge the parasites. Trophonts
were harvested by filtering through a 0.22 μm filter to
remove fish skin. The trophonts were placed into a Petri
dish to allow them to develop into theronts that were used
to infect 8 fish each for the collection of trophonts,
toments, and theronts, respectively. Trophonts were
directly collected from the skin surface of the 8 infected
fish. To collect tomonts and theronts, trophonts isolated
from fish were placed in Petri dishes and allowed to
attach. After replacing the water in the Petri dishes with
fresh dechlorinated water to remove contaminating
mucus, the trophonts were incubated at 24°C for 8 h to
harvest tomonts (32–128 cells/cyst) or 24 h to harvest
theronts. Trophonts, tomonts and theronts were washed
with PBS (pH 7.4), concentrated with a centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Miami, FL) at 228 × g for 5 min and discarded supernatant. After washing 3 times with PBS,
parasite samples from the three life stages were stored in
liquid nitrogen and used for the isolation of RNA for the
construction of normalized cDNA library.
RNA isolation
Total RNA was isolated from the samples using the TRIzol
reagent method from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA)
according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, samples
of tomont, theront, and trophont were resuspended after
thawing on ice, and 100 μl each were combined in a sterile tube to provide a total of 300 μl of Ich samples with
equal fractions from each of its three life stages. As the
major objective of this study was to generate EST resources
with maximal efficiency of gene discovery, a pooled sample followed with normalization would allow inclusion of
all transcripts in the library while reducing cost for library
construction and increasing gene discovery rate. Three
milliliters of TRIzol reagent was added to the sample tube.
Cells were lysed by repetitively pipetting up and down.
RNA was isolated following the manufacturer's protocol.
The RNA pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of RNase-free
double distilled water and divided into 25 μl aliquots.
RNA aliquots were checked for quality using agarose gel
electrophoreses containing formaldehyde.

Normalized library construction
The Creator Smart cDNA Library Construction Kit from
Clontech (Mountain View, CA) and components from the
TRIMMER-DIRECT Kit from Evrogen (Moscow, Russia)
were used for the construction of the normalized cDNA
library. Total RNA concentration was checked on a spectrophotometer and 1 μg RNA was combined with 1 μl of
SMART IV oligonucleotide (Clontech) and 1 μl CDS-3M
adapter (Evrogen) for first-strand cDNA synthesis. The
reaction was incubated at 72°C for 2 min followed by
immediate cooling on ice for 2 min. Next, 2 μl of 5× first
strand buffer, 1 μl of DTT (20 mM), 1 μl of dNTP mix (10
mM), and 1 μl of PowerScript reverse transcriptase were
added to the tube and incubated at 42°C for 1 h in a thermal cycler (PTC-100, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) then placed
on ice. The SMART cDNA cloning system allows the
enrichment of full-length cDNA through the use of a 5'linker with 3'-GGG tails. Reverse transcriptase has terminal transferase activity that preferentially adds three additional Cs at the end of first strand cDNA. As a result, the
first strand cDNA is able to base pair with the 5'-linker
with 3'-GGG tails. Once base paired, the reverse transcriptase would switch the template and extend into the
linker sequences allowing PCR amplification of fulllength cDNA using a single primer (the 5'-linker has the
same sequences as the linker containing poly T used for
the synthesis of the first strand cDNA). Truncated cDNAs
are not able to base pair with the 5'-linker and, therefore,
get lost in the PCR amplification of the full-length cDNA.

The first strand cDNA was initially amplified by long-distance PCR (LD-PCR) using hot-start amplification. For the
reaction, the following were combined in a reaction tube:
1.5 μl of the first strand cDNA, 60 μl of sterile deionized
water, 7.5 μl of 10× Advantage 2 PCR buffer, 1.5 μl of 50×
dNTP mix, 3 μl of 5' PCR primer and 1.5 μl of 50× Advantage 2 polymerase mix. The tube was mixed and briefly
centrifuged and added to a pre-heated (95°C) thermal
cycler. Cycle settings were 95°C for 1 min followed by 19
cycles of 95°C for 7 s, 66°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 5.5
min. The product was analyzed on a 1.1% agarose gel to
determine the sizes and amount of the cDNA products
before proceeding to the next step. The LD-PCR reaction
was purified and eluted in 30 μl of sterile Nanopure water
using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
For the normalization procedure, the TRIMMER-DIRECT
Kit from Evrogen (Moscow, Russia) was used. This system
is specially developed to normalize cDNA enriched with
full length sequences [49,50]. The cDNA from the LD-PCR
was quantified [~100 ng/μl] and 1 μl was mixed with 1 μl
of the 4× hybridization buffer and 2 μl of sterile water. The
mix was overlaid with mineral oil and incubated for 3 min
at 98°C followed by 4 h at 70°C. Then, 5 μl of 2× DSN

buffer (preheated to 70°C) and 0.25 Kunitz units of DSN
enzyme were added and incubated at 70°C for 20 min.
The DSN enzyme specifically degrades double-stranded
molecules. The reaction was inactivated by adding 10 μl of
DSN stop solution, and sterile water added to a final volume of 40 μl.
Following normalization, two rounds of PCR were performed using 1 μl of the normalization reaction as template. A shorter primer M1 (first 23 bases of the SMART IV
oligonucleotide) was used in the first round of PCR with
15 amplification cycles using the same thermal cycling
parameters as above; and an even shorter primer M2 (first
20 bases of the SMART IV oligonucleotide) was used in
the second round of PCR for 15 amplification cycles of
95°C for 7 s, 64°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 5.5 min. Products were checked on a 1.1% agarose gel. The PCR products were quantified and 3 μg were used for treatment
with proteinase K. All the subsequent procedures including proteinase K treatment, restriction digestion with Sfi I,
size fractionation, and ligation followed the manufacture's instructions (Clontech). The cDNA was ligated to
the pDNR-LIB vector. Electroporation (MicroPulser, BioRad, Hercules, CA) was performed using DH12S electrocompetent cells following supplier's instructions (Invitrogen). A total of approximately 700,000 primary
recombinant clones were obtained, and the library was
amplified, titered, and stored in glycerol stocks in a -80°C
freezer.
Plasmid isolation and EST sequencing
Independent colonies were picked and grown for 20 h at
37°C in 1.2 ml LB broth containing 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the Perfectprep
Plasmid 96 Vacuum Direct Bind Kit from Eppendorf
(Westbury, NY). Plasmids were stored at -20°C until
usage. The cDNA inserts were directionally sequenced
from the 5'-end of the cDNAs using universal M13(-21)
primer and the BigDye terminator sequencing kit version
3.1 from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) on a
3130XL DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
Sequence analysis
Base calling was performed using the Phred program
[30,31] at quality cut-off set at Phred 20. Raw sequences
were then imported into the Vector NTI Advance 10 software (Invitrogen) and were subjected to trimming of vector sequences and 5'adapter sequences using default
settings. Afterwards, poly (A) tails were trimmed where
necessary and sequences less than 100 bases were
removed. Contigs were built in Vector NTI ContigExpress
using default settings. All unique sequences were compared to the GenBank database using BLASTX in the nonredundant (NR), Swiss-Prot, and Plasmodium falciparum
3D7 genome database. For comparison to the Tetrahy-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/176

mena thermophila SB210 genome, tBLASTx was used. The
cut-off for sequence similarity used was E-value < 10-5 for
all analyses. Ciliate nuclear translation code was used in
the BLAST searches. Search results from genome comparisons were summarized using a Venn diagram.
Gene ontology (GO) annotations were assigned using the
program Blast2GO [48]. BLASTX results were loaded into
the program and the default settings were used to assign
GO terms to all unique sequences. From these annotations, pie charts were made using 2nd level GO terms
based on biological process, molecular function, and cellular component.
Putative secretory proteins and signal peptides were identified using both neural networks and hidden Markov
model methods in SignalP 3.0 [43]. All 4,706 unique ESTs
were used as the tester sequences. Open reading frames
were predicted using both OrfPredictor [51] and BLASTX,
with ciliate nuclear genetic code for ESTs of known genes
and just OrfPredictor with unknown ESTs. The resulting
deduced protein sequences from the ORFs were uploaded
into SignalP 3.0. Sequences were identified as putatively
secretory, predicted with signal peptides if both D-score in
the neural network model and prediction probability in
the hidden Markov model were significant.
Total lengths of all ESTs, G+C% content and simple repetitive elements were estimated using the Repeatmasker
program [52].
Accession numbers
All Ich EST sequences were submitted to the dbEST database of NCBI. Continuous accession numbers are from
EG957858–EG966289.
