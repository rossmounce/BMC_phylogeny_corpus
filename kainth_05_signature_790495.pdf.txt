Abstract
Background: The alpha (α) proteobacteria, a very large and diverse group, are presently characterized
solely on the basis of 16S rRNA trees, with no known molecular characteristic that is unique to this group.
The genomes of three α-proteobacteria, Rickettsia prowazekii (RP), Caulobacter crescentus (CC) and
Bartonella quintana (BQ), were analyzed in order to search for proteins that are unique to this group.
Results: Blast analyses of protein sequences from the above genomes have led to the identification of 61
proteins which are distinctive characteristics of α-proteobacteria and are generally not found in any other
bacteria. These α-proteobacterial signature proteins are generally of hypothetical functions and they can
be classified as follows: (i) Six proteins (CC2102, CC3292, CC3319, CC1887, CC1725 and CC1365)
which are uniquely present in most sequenced α-proteobacterial genomes; (ii) Ten proteins (CC1211,
CC1886, CC2245, CC3470, CC0520, CC0365, CC0366, CC1977, CC3010 and CC0100) which are
present in all α-proteobacteria except the Rickettsiales; (iii) Five proteins (CC2345, CC3115, CC3401,
CC3467 and CC1021) not found in the intracellular bacteria belonging to the order Rickettsiales and the
Bartonellaceae family; (iv) Four proteins (CC1652, CC2247, CC3295 and CC1035) that are absent from
various Rickettsiales as well as Rhodobacterales; (v) Three proteins (RP104, RP105 and RP106) that are
unique to the order Rickettsiales and four proteins (RP766, RP192, RP030 and RP187) which are specific
for the Rickettsiaceae family; (vi) Six proteins (BQ00140, BQ00720, BQ03880, BQ12030, BQ07670 and
BQ11900) which are specific to the order Rhizobiales; (vii) Four proteins (BQ01660, BQ02450, BQ03770
and BQ13470) which are specific for the order Rhizobiales excluding the family Bradyrhizobiaceae; (viii) Nine
proteins (BQ12190, BQ11460, BQ11450, BQ11430, BQ11380, BQ11160, BQ11120, BQ11100 and
BQ11030 which are distinctive of the Bartonellaceae family;(ix) Six proteins (CC0189, CC0569, CC0331,
CC0349, CC2323 and CC2637) which show sporadic distribution in α-proteobacteria, (x) Four proteins
(CC2585, CC0226, CC2790 and RP382) in which lateral gene transfers are indicated to have occurred
between α-proteobacteria and a limited number of other bacteria.
Conclusion: The identified proteins provide novel means for defining and identifying the αproteobacteria and many of its subgroups in clear molecular terms and in understanding the evolution of
this group of species. These signature proteins, together with the large number of α-proteobacteria
specific indels that have recently been identified http://www.bacterialphylogeny.com, provide evidence that
all species from this diverse group share many unifying and distinctive characteristics. Functional studies
on these proteins should prove very helpful in the identification of such characteristics.

Background

The α-proteobacteria comprise a large and extremely
diverse group of Gram-negative bacteria which form a part
of the largest known phyla within prokaryotes, namely
the proteobacteria [1]. The vast diversity of the α-subdivision is clearly evident through the lifestyle differences
among its members making them important in agricultural, medical and industrial fields. Such examples
include the animal and human intracellular pathogens
(Rickettsia, Bartonella, and Brucella) [1-3], the plant pathogens and symbiotic soil bacteria (Agrobacterium, Sinorhizobium, Mesorhizobium, and Bradyrhizobium) [1,4-6], the
Drosophila endosymbiont (Wolbachia) [1] and a number
of other free-living bacteria occupying a wide variety of
ecological niches [1]. Furthermore, this group exhibits a
wide spectrum of characteristics in terms of morphology
(spiral, rod, stalked), metabolism (phototrophs, heterotrophs, and chemolithotrophs), physiology and cell division mechanisms [1,7,8]. In addition to their great
diversity in these regards, this group of species is also of
central importance due to compelling evidence indicating
that a large proportion of the genes in eukaryotic cells,
especially those related to mitochondria, have an α-proteobacterial ancestry [9-16].
In the current view, the α-subdivision are thought to form
a more recently branching monophyletic taxon emerging
after the epsilon and delta but before the beta and gamma
subdivisions or Classes of proteobacteria [1,13,17].
Although this group is distinguished from other major
bacterial groups based on 16S rRNA and other gene phylogenies [7,13,17-19], no set of criteria exists to clearly
define and circumscribe the α-proteobacteria in clear and
unambiguous molecular terms [1]. Thus, the following
question remains: what defining molecular characteristics
distinguish an α-proteobacterium and its subgroups from
all other bacteria? The task of identifying such markers is
aided by the availability of 18 completely sequenced αproteobacterial genomes along with 10 partially
sequenced genomes [11,20-33], belonging to the following orders: Rhizobiales, Rickettsiales, Caulobacterales, Rhodobacterales, Sphingomonadales and Rhodospirillales [34]. The
comparative analyses of genomes provides a valuable
resource and a very powerful means for identifying characteristics that are unique to a particular group of species
[6,16,27,28,32,35,36]. We have used these data to identify a large number of conserved inserts and deletions
(indels) in protein sequences that are distinctive characteristics of different groups of bacteria and provide molecular means for their identification and characterization
[13,37-40]. Recently, we have also identified many conserved indels in protein sequences that are useful for
defining the α-proteobacteria group, and its various subgroups, in molecular terms [17]. The distribution pattern
of these signatures in different α-proteobacteria has been

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/94

used to deduce a working model to describe the interrelationships as well as the branching order among the α-proteobacteria species [17].
In the present study, a new type of taxonomic marker is
described which provides an additional means to define
the α-proteobacteria group as well as the relationship
within this group. These new markers consist of whole
proteins that are specific to certain groups or subgroups of
bacteria and are not found in any other phyla [35]. In this
work we have identified a large number of proteins which
are specific to either the α-proteobacteria group as a whole
or its various subgroups. These signature proteins were
identified in BLASTP searches [41] of individual proteins
from the genomes of three α-proteobacterial species (viz.
Rickettsia prowazekii, Caulobacter crescentus and Bartonella
quintana) [11,24,32], which show important differences
in lifestyles and physiology. Results of this study presented here will prove useful in developing a clearer picture of α-proteobacterial phylogeny as well as aid in the
identification of bacterial strains belonging to this group
and its subgroups. Functional studies on these α-proteobacteria specific proteins should prove instrumental in the
discovery of novel physiological characteristics that are
uniquely shared by members of this large and diverse
group of bacteria.

Results
These studies were undertaken with the aim of identifying
proteins that are uniquely found in α-proteobacteria and
which could provide novel molecular means for defining
and identifying bacteria belonging to this group and its
subgroups. To identify proteins which are specific to αproteobacteria or its subgroups, BLAST searches were carried out individually on every single annotated protein
present in the genomes of three different α-proteobacteria, C. crescentus, R. prowazekii and B. quintana. These
genomes were chosen because of their different sizes (R.
prowazekii, 1.11 Mb with 835 open reading frames
(ORFs); B. qunitana, 1.58 Mb, 1142 ORFs; C. crescentus,
4.02 Mb with 3737 ORFs) and because these species display important differences in life-style and other characteristics [11,24,32]. Results of the BLAST searches were
inspected in order to identify proteins which are only
found in α-proteobacteria, as well as proteins where the
only acceptable BLAST scores as indicated by their
expected values (E values) were from α-proteobacteria
[41]. These studies have resulted in the identification of
61 signature proteins, which appear distinctive of α-proteobacteria and are generally not found in any other Bacteria. For all of these proteins, the lengths of the query
proteins as well as the E values obtained from BLAST
searches for different hits are shown (Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9). The former values are important in determining
the significance of the observed BLAST scores (See

a Alpha-specific proteins were identified by BLAST searches on individual protein sequences on three α-proteobacterial genomes as described in
the Methods section. The expected (E) values for various alpha-proteobacteria species as well as the first non-alpha species in the BLAST results
are shown here. The values in brackets after the E values represent the ratios of the length of the hit protein divided by the query protein and a
value close to 1.0 indicates that the homologues are of similar lengths. The CC numbers indicate the protein identification number in the C.
crescentus genome. GenBank accession numbers for the query sequence are shown in square brackets. An asterisk (*) identifies bacterial genomes
which are completely sequenced, whereas other sequences are from partially or incompletely sequenced genomes. Proteins not found in a given
species are indicated with a dash (-). Abbreviations: Agr. tum., Agrobacterium tumefaciens; Ana. mar., Anaplasma marginale; Azo. sp., Azoarcus sp. EbN1;

species, these proteins remain largely distinctive of the αsubdivision. Interestingly, no homologues were detected
in Zymomonas mobilis for three of these signature proteins
(CC3319, CC1887, CC1725). Z. mobilis is also lacking a
number of other signature proteins described in this study
and this may be attributed to the genetic loss of a variety
genes resulting in its small genome size (2.06 Mb) [33]. A
number of genes for the tricarboxcylic acid cycle as well as
other functions have previously been documented as
missing in this genome [33]. One of these signature pro-

teins (CC1725) is also not found in Novosphingobium aromaticivorans indicating it was lost from members of the
Sphingomonadales family. A homologue of the protein
CC3319 was detected in the currently unclassified Magnetococcus sp. MC-1 genome suggesting that this species may
be distantly related to the α-proteobacteria [42]. A
number of α-proteobacteria-specific indels (i.e., inserts or
deletions) are also present in Magnetococcus [17], supporting the above inference. Finally, the protein CC1887 is

homologues of otherwise α-specific proteins. These
results suggests that the genes for these proteins have
either been lost from the Rickettsiales or it forms one of the
earliest branching lineage within α-proteobacteria [2,43].
These proteins are present in almost all other sequenced
α-proteobacteria with few exceptions. The proteins
CC0520 and CC0366 have homologues in Magnetococcus
sp. MC-1 again lending support to the inference that this
unclassified species is distantly related to the alpha-group.
The protein CC1977 is also found in Eukaryotes and the E
values for a few representative eukaryotic species are given
in the Table 2 legend. One protein (CC3010), showing a
very high affinity for this grouping as noted by low E values, is also found in a single gamma proteobacterium

(Pseudomonas sp.). This finding is most likely due to a nonspecific event such as a lateral gene transfer (LGT) of
which additional examples will be presented later.
The next grouping of signature proteins are those which
are found in almost all sequenced α-proteobacteria
excluding the intracellular pathogens belonging to the
Bartonellaceae family and the order Rickettsiales (Table 3A).
This grouping outlines a case in which proteins have
probably been lost independently from two unrelated
groups within the α-proteobacteria most likely due to
their intracellular lifestyles [2,3,44]. Five proteins of this
type were identified with minimal loses seen in other αproteobacteria. CC2345 provides a good example of this

type of protein since it is highly conserved in all available
α-proteobacterial genomes as indicated by low E values.
The other four proteins also show a high affinity for this
category with losses occurring only in Z. mobilis and Rhodospirillum rubrum.
A variation on the above theme is a collection of 4 α-specific proteins that are absent in the orders Rickettsiales and
Rhodobacterales (Table 3B). However, a key feature distinguishing these proteins from those presented in Table 3A
is the free-living lifestyle of the Rhodobacterales as opposed
to the intracellular Bartonellas. Since Rickettsiales and the
Rhodobacterales are not known to share any unique
characteristic, it is possible that the loss of these proteins
from these two orders has occurred due to unrelated
reasons. Also, some additional losses are seen in this
grouping. For example the protein CC1652 is absent in
the Sphingomonadales while the protein CC1035 is absent
in the Rhodospirillales. Note that the protein CC2247
exhibits high E values for BLAST hits representing Brucellaceae and Bartonellaceae but this high E value is acceptable
due to the very short length of this protein (46 amino

acids) and the fact that besides α-proteobacteria no other
BLAST hits were observed (Table 3B).
The Blast searches on proteins found in the R. prowazekii
genome have led to identification of a number of signature proteins which are specific to species belonging to the
order Rickettsiales. This order is made up of two families:
the Anaplasmataceae (Anaplasma, Ehrlichia and Wolbachia)
and Rickettsiaceae (Rickettsias) [2,43]. The first group of
such proteins (RP104, RP105, and RP106) are present in
all species belonging to the order Rickettsiales, but are not
found in any other α-proteobacteria (Table 4). It should
be noted that the proteins RP104 and RP106 do not show
homology over the entire length of the homologous proteins in members of the Anaplasmataceae family. Thus,
additional domains that are specific for the Rickettsiaceae
family may be present in these proteins. These signature
proteins are highly conserved within this order, as indicated by their very low E values (Table 4) and represent
interesting examples of genes that were likely introduced
in a common ancestor of the Rickettsiales. Note that the
first non-Rickettsiale BLAST hit for the protein RP106
appears at 2e-07 (Xyella fastidiosa). RP106 is still included

as a Rickettsiales-specific protein because the Xyella protein
is only 348 amino acids in length and thus it is likely a different protein.
Another group of 4 proteins are specific to the Rickettsia
species and are not found in other members of the Rickettsiales (Table 4). These proteins (RP766, RP192, RP030
and RP187) are highly conserved and represent cases in
which genes were introduced into a common ancestor of
the Rickettsiaceae. Homologues of the protein RP187 are
much longer in other Rickettsia strains (194 vs 497 aa) but
the region representing the query sequence is highly conserved. It is possible that other Rickettsia species have
acquired an additional protein domain during the course
of evolution.

In addition to the Rickettsiales, the Rhizobiales form a
major order within the α-proteobacteria [1,17,42]. To
identify proteins which are distinctive of the Rhizobiales,
BLAST searches were carried out on all ORFs in the
genome of B. quintana. Six proteins have been identified
that are conserved amongst all sequenced Rhizobiales with
minimal evidence of gene loss occurring (Table 5). The
protein BQ07670 is absent in Rhodopseudomonas palustris
while the protein BQ11900 is absent in this strain as well
as in Sinorhizobium meliloti. The presence of these proteins
solely in the Rhizobiales indicates they were likely introduced in a common ancestor of this order.
Other signature proteins that are useful in defining the
Rhizobiales are those which are present in all sequences

members of this order, except the Bradyrhizobiaceae family
(Table 6). Four proteins of this type have been identified
with no losses occurring in any species. These proteins
indicate that the Bradyrhizobiaceae family is more distantly
related to other members of the Rhizobiales. The deeper
branching and distinctness of Bradyrhizobiaceae and Methylobacteriaceae from other Rhizobiales is also strongly supported by phylogenetic analyses based on different gene
sequences and conserved indels in many proteins
[1,17,45].
A number of proteins have also been identified which are
unique to the Bartonella species. Nine examples of such
proteins are shown in Table 7. These proteins are highly
conserved amongst both sequenced Bartonella species
with no gene losses occurring. The presence of these proteins solely in this family of α-proteobacteria indicates
that they should provide useful markers for the Bartonellaceae family.
Six other α-specific signature proteins were identified that
do not show any distinct pattern but are sporadically
present in α-proteobacterial species (Table 8). These proteins are more randomly distributed among a limited
number of sequenced α-proteobacteria and it is likely that
gene losses for these proteins have occurred independently in various species or groups. Nevertheless, these proteins are still unique to the α-proteobacteria. The protein
CC0189 is represented in the Rhodospirillales, Novosphingomonadales, Caulobacterales and Rhodobacterales but is not
found in any Rhizobiales. One protein (CC0331) is represented in various families within the Rhizobiales while two
others (CC2323 and CC2637) show a similar trend and
are also present in Rhodospirillales.
A final grouping of 4 signature proteins consists of those
where limited lateral gene transfers (LGTs) have apparently occurred (Table 9). Three of these proteins
(CC2585, CC0226 and CC2790) were isolated from the
Caulobacter genome and represent cases in which genes
were also present in a limited numbers of gamma or betaproteobacteria. Specifically, a homologue of the protein
CC2585 was detected in a number of gamma-proteobacteria belonging to the Pseudomonadaceae family while
CC0226 was only detected in Pse. aeruginosa and the
enteric bacterium Salmonella enterica. The protein CC2790
shows some similarity to a Superfamily I DNA and RNA
helicase found in Burkholderia cepacia (beta-proteobacteria). However, this BLAST hit only shows conservation
over 142 amino acids of the 567 amino acids C. crescentus
protein. Furthermore, all alpha BLAST hits are annotated
as hypothetical proteins indicating this non-alpha BLAST
hit probably represents a different protein with a shared
protein domain that was transferred. Interestingly, one of
the proteins, RP382, which is otherwise highly specific for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/94

the order Rickettsiales, is also found in Aquifex aeolicus. In
each of these cases, the direction of gene transfer remains
unclear.

Discussion

The α-proteobacteria forms an extremely diverse group
showing vast differences in such characteristics as morphology, metabolism, and physiology [1]. In the current
view, this group is distinguished from all other Bacteria
based on 16S rRNA phylogenetic trees [1,8,19,46]. Few
molecular or physiological characteristics were known
which clearly distinguish this group from all other Bacteria
[1,7]. However, our recent work has identified a large
number of conserved inserts and deletions in protein
sequences which are distinctive characteristics of α-proteobacteria and its subgroups and not found in any other
groups of Bacteria [17] (see also http://www.bacterialphy
logeny.com). These signatures provide useful tools for
identifying α-proteobacteria within Bacteria as well as for
understanding the interrelationships and branching order
within this group. Here, we describe 61 signature proteins
that are largely specific for the α-proteobacteria. Almost
all of these proteins are of hypothetical functions, and in
view of their α-proteobacterial specificity, it is likely that
they are involved in functions that are limited to only this
group of bacteria. Because such genes are likely involved
in specialized functions, the loss of some of these genes
from certain α-proteobacterial species is not surprising.
Based on signature proteins described here, along with
various α-proteobacteria-specific conserved inserts and
deletions [17], a clearer picture of α-proteobacteria phylogeny and taxonomic classification can be derived. Figure
1 presents a model for α-proteobacterial evolution which
indicates the evolutionary stages where these proteins are
suggested to have evolved or been introduced. The model
based on these signature proteins is identical to that
deduced independently based upon a large number of
conserved indels in different proteins [17], indicating its
reliability.
Several signature proteins are specific to nearly all α-proteobacteria. These proteins provide additional support to
various alpha-distinguishing indels, which are found only
in the α-proteobacteria and not in any other groups of
bacteria. Examples of such indels include the following:
an 8 amino acid insert in the α subunit of ATP synthase
complex, 3 amino acid insert in prolipoprotein-phosphatidylglycerol transferase, and a 1 amino acid deletion
in the FtsK protein [17]. The simplest and most parsimonious explanation for the presence of these α-specific signatures (both proteins and indels) is that they were
introduced once in a common ancestor of all α-proteobacteria and their presence in various α-proteobacterial
species is due to vertical transmission [47,48]. It is difficult to explain the presence of these genes in various α-

proteobacteria by other non-specific means such as lateral
gene transfers [49]. The finding of these unique genes and
conserved indels in various α-subdivision members
strongly indicates that all such bacteria carry out certain
physiological functions that are unique to the members of
this group. Therefore, studies aimed at determining the
functional roles of these proteins and indels are of much
interest.
The largest group of signature proteins discovered are
those found in all α-proteobacteria excluding the order
Rickettsiales. These proteins indicate that the Rickettsiales
constitute a distinct clade within the α-subdivision, which
is in accordance with phylogenetic analyses based on different gene sequences [2,17,43,50]. Phylogenetic studies
based on 16S rRNA and many other genes [2,43,45,50], as
well as our studies based on conserved indels in several
proteins that are present in various α-proteobacteria but
absent in Rickettsiales as well as other groups of bacteria
[17], provide evidence that the Rickettsiales comprise the
deepest branching group within α-proteobacteria. In view
of this, the most logical explanation for these signatures is
that they were introduced in a common ancestor of other
α-proteobacteria after the divergence of the Rickettsiales
(Figure 1).
An interesting group of α-specific signature proteins are
those which are absent in the intracellular pathogens
belonging to the order Rickettsiales and the family Bartonellaceae. The latter group of species form a family
within the Rhizobiales order [1,17]. Because these two
groups are phylogenetically unrelated, it is likely that the
genes for these proteins were selectively lost in these two
groups independently due to their intracellular lifestyles.
It is logical to assume that the cellular functions of these
proteins are either not required in the intracellular environment, or they are provided for by the host cells leading
to the loss of these genes from these organisms. These proteins could have been introduced in either a common
ancestor of all α-proteobacteria and subsequently lost in
the Rickettsiales and Bartonellaceae, or introduced after the
divergence of the Rickettsiales and lost in the Bartonellaceae. It is interesting that the Brucellas (also intracellular
pathogens) have retained all of these proteins indicating
that this group differ in its physiological requirements
from other α-proteobacterial intracellular pathogens
[1,3,51]. Several α-specific signature proteins that are
absent in both the Rickettsiales as well as Rhodobacterales
were also identified. Since there is no evidence to suggest
any sort of relationship between these two groups [1,17],
the simplest explanation is that these genes were introduced after the divergence of the Rickettsiales and lost preferentially by the Rhodobacterales.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/94

Other signature proteins were isolated pointing to a variety of relationships. For instance, the protein CC0189
which is only present in Caulobacterales, Rhodobacteriales,
Rhodospirillales and Novosphingomonadales indicates a close
relationship between these deep branching orders within
α-proteobacteria. This relationship is also seen from the
protein CC0349 but to a lesser extent since losses have
occurred in some species. These findings are supported by
indels in a variety of proteins that indicate these orders
show a closer relationship and have branched prior to the
Rhizobiales [17]. Other signature proteins are found in a
selection of these above orders and are also found in some
but not all families within the Rhizobiales (CC0331,
CC2323 and CC2637). A close relationship between Caulobacter and Rhodobacterales is generally indicated by phylogenetic trees and is also supported by a conserved 11
amino acid insert in the protein aspargine-glutamine
amido transferase [1,17]. Thus, it is somewhat surprising
that in our analysis of the Caulobacter genome, we did not
identify any signature protein that was uniquely shared by
these two α-proteobacterial orders. However, a 12 amino
acid insert in the protein DNA ligase indicates that Rhodobacterales may be more closely related to Rhizobiales in
comparison to Caulobacterales [17]. In view of these
results, and the fact that C. crescentus represents the only
fully sequenced bacterium within its order [24], additional sequence information is required to further clarify
the evolutionary relationships amongst Rhizobiales, Rhodobacterales and Caulobacterales.
Several signature proteins were found to be specific for
either the order Rickettsiales or the family Rickettsiaceae.
These proteins provide molecular markers for these
groups and they likely originated in common ancestors of
these groups. The distinctness of these groups is also supported by a number of conserved indels in different
proteins which are uniquely present in the species from
these groups, but not found in any other bacteria [17]. It
should be noted that McLeod et al. [28] based upon their
comparative analysis of the Rickettsias genomes have identified a number of hypothetical proteins that are only
found in particular Rickettsias. These proteins were
grouped into the following classes: R. typhi ORFs not
found in R. conorii or R. prowazekii; R. typhi ORFs found in
R. conorii but not in R. prowazekii; and R. typhi ORFs found
in R. prowazekii but not in R. conorii. However, no proteins
that were specific for all Rickettsias or Rickettsiales were
described in the McLeod et al. study [28].
A number of signature proteins identified here are useful
in defining and characterizing the Rhizobiales order. Of the
six Rhizobiales-specific proteins described here, four (viz.
BQ00140, BQ00720, BQ03880 and BQ12030) are completely conserved amongst all sequenced Rhizobiales and
should provide good molecular markers for this order.

Page 12 of 16

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:94

Two other proteins (BQ07670 and BQ11900) also show
a high affinity for this grouping with a few gene losses in
some species. We have previously described a conserved
indel in tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase that is present in
all sequenced Rhizobiales but is absent in all other bacteria
[17]. These signatures were likely introduced in a
common ancestor of the Rhizobiales order (Figure 1). Four
additional proteins that were identified here are completely specific to all sequenced Rhizobiales, except for the
Bradyrhizobiaceae family. Phylogenetic analysis based on a
number of gene sequences as well as conserved indels in a
number of proteins (viz. Trp-tRNA synthetase, LytB metalloproteinase) provide evidence that that the Bradyrhizobiaceae family is distantly related to other Rhizobiales
(Rhizobiaceae, Brucellaceae, Phyllobacteriaceae), and it has
branched prior to the latter groups of species [1,17,45].
Thus, it is likely that these signature proteins evolved in a
common ancestor of various other Rhizobiales after the
divergence of the Bradyrhizobiaceae family (Figure 1). A
number of signature proteins that are unique for the Bartonella species were later introduced in that particular
branch of the tree (Figure 1).
Although most of the signature proteins identified here
are specific for only the α-proteobacteria, we have also
come across a few examples where lateral gene transfer
seems to have occurred between α-proteobacteria and a
few species from other groups of bacteria. The rarity of
such proteins in comparison to those which exhibit strict
group-specificity indicates that most newly acquired
alpha-specific genes have been predominantly transmitted via vertical descent and LGT and other non-specific
mechanisms play relatively minor role in their transmission. It should be mentioned that although our analyses
of proteins in R. prowazekii, C. crescentus and B. quintana
genomes have identified a large number of signature proteins, based on these studies signature proteins for certain
other groups within α-proteobacteria (e.g. Rhizobiaceae,
Rhodobacterales, Sphignomonadales, etc.) will not be
detected. It should be possible to identify signatures for
these groups by carrying out similar analysis using protein
sequences from these genomes.
Daubin and Ochmann [52] and Lerat et al. [36,47] have
previously examined the gene repertoire of γ-proteobacteria and have indicated the presence of many ORFans
genes (i.e. ORFs that have no known homologs) that are
limited to either certain bacterial strains or particular subgroups of γ-proteobacteria. The ORFan genes were found
to be present in their studies in different monophyletic
clades at different phylogenetic depths, which is similar to
what we have reported here for the signature proteins in
the α-proteobacteria taxon. The other characteristics of
ORFans genes noted by these authors were that they are
generally short (between 400–500 bp), A+T rich, and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/94

evolve faster than other genes which are more broadly distributed [47,52]. Many of the signature proteins identified
in the present work are of similar lengths as the ORFans
genes. These earlier studies also indicate that ORFans
genes generally encode for functional proteins, and once
acquired they are vertically transmitted, and based on
them it possible to make robust phylogenetic inference as
we have been able to do in the present study for α-proteobacteria. Although the source of ORFans genes in different
genomes remains to be determined, it has been suggested
that many of them are derived from bacteriophages
[47,52].
The concept that mitochondria have originated from an
α-proteobacterial ancestor is supported by a large body of
evidence including phylogenetic analysis and shared
presence of many common indels [9-14]. The homologues of two of the α-proteobacterial signature proteins
(CC1887 and CC1977) are also present in Eukaryotes providing further support for this inference. For the
remainder of the proteins no eukaryotic homologues were
detected which supports the observation of Boussau et al.
[44] that for a large fraction of genes in α-proteobacterial
genome no homologs are found in the eukaryotes. Currently, it is thought that within α-proteobacteria the
species belonging to the order Rickettsiales are the closest
relatives of mitochondria [10-12,53-55]. However, of the
two proteins which are commonly found in eukaryotes,
only one of them (CC1887) is present in the Rickettsiales.
A specific relationship of mitochondria to the Rickettsiales
is also supported by only some conserved indels, but not
all [17]. In a recent study, where the relationship of alpha
proteobacteria to mitochondria was examined based on a
large number of individual and concatenated protein
sequences [56], the closest relationship of mitochondria
was seen for Rhodospirillum rubrum rather than the Rickettsiales. In earlier work, we have described two conserved
signatures (a 37 aa insert in valyl-tRNA synthetase and 1
aa indel in LonA protein), which were commonly shared
by all eukaryotic homologs and certain other groups of
bacteria but which were not found in any α-proteobacteria [13]. An update of these signatures indicates that they
still constitute exceptions to the α-proteobacterial derivation of the mitochondrial/eukaryotic homologs (R.S.
Gupta, unpublished results). These observations in conjunction with the recent conflicting observations regarding the possible origins of NADH dehydrogenase subunits
from Trichomonas vaginalis [57,58] indicate that additional work is necessary to clarify the sources of different
mitochondrial and nuclear cytosolic genes of eukaryotic
proteins.

Conclusion
Whole-genome analyses of B. quintana, Ri prowazekii and
C. crescentus proteins have led to the discovery of 61

signature proteins which are distinctive characteristics of
the α-proteobacteria and its subgroups. These signature
proteins provide additional support to our recent work
based on a large number of conserved inserts and deletions in protein sequences that are either specific for the αproteobacteria or provide information regarding the
interrelationships and branching order within this group
[17]. Sequence information from additional α-proteobacterial species will be useful in testing the predicted presence or absence of various identified molecular signatures
(indels and proteins) in different groups, thus validating
the suggested relationships. Studies aimed at understanding the cellular functions of these α-specific signature proteins should be of much interest since they will likely
provide novel insights into unique physiological characteristics shared by this important group of bacteria and its
various subgroups. Studies on proteins which are specific
to the intracellular pathogens, such as Rickettsiales and
Bartonella, could also provide new drug targets for their
associated diseases.

Methods

Identification of α-Proteobacteria Specific Proteins
To identify signature proteins which are specific to the αproteobacteria or its various subgroups, all proteins in the
genomes of C. crescentus, R. prowazekii, and B. quintana
were analyzed. BLAST searches were carried out [41] on
each individual protein in these genomes to identify all
other bacteria containing proteins with similar sequences.
These results were visually inspected for homologues
showing specificity to α-proteobacteria with no other similar homologues present in any other Bacteria. Expect
values (E values) were analyzed for putative α-specific
proteins. The E values, which are calculated by the BLAST
software, indicate the probability that the observed similarity between the query protein and any other protein
detected by the BLAST search arose by chance [41]. In
BLAST searches, the E values are lowest (closer to 0) for
BLAST hits with a high degree of homology to the query
sequence and they increase as BLAST hits are detected with
lower similarity. The results of BLAST searches were
inspected for sudden increases in E values from the last αproteobacteria in the search to the first non-alpha bacteria. This increase in E values was important when the next
non-alpha BLAST hit was in a range where the observed
similarity could occur by chance (> 10-05). However,
higher E values were sometimes allowed and could be significant for smaller proteins since they contain fewer characters resulting in higher E values (for statistical reasons)
for their true homologs. For all α-specific signature proteins described here, E values were recorded for each blast
hit as well as for the first non-alpha bacterium in a given
search. Although E values take into account the length of
the sequence over which the similarity is observed
between the query sequence and a BLAST hit, low E values

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/94

can sometime result if high degree of homology is
observed between two different proteins over a short
sequence region. Therefore, we have also inspected BLAST
results for homology over the entire protein length and for
similarity in protein length. The length ratios of the hit
proteins over the query protein are shown in brackets
beside the E values and these values are expected to be
close to 1.00 if the identified proteins are of similar
lengths as the query protein. It should be mentioned that
BLAST searches can sometime indicate misleading similarity, particularly when no close relatives of the query
species are in the database [59]. However, in the present
study where most of the BLAST hits correspond to α-proteobacteria, such a possibility is highly unlikely. All proteins indicated in the Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 are
specific for the α-proteobacteria based on these criteria
unless otherwise mentioned.
