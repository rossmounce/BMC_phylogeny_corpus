Abstract
Background: Quaternary climatic oscillations had dramatic effects on species evolution. In northern latitudes,
populations had to survive the coldest periods in refugial areas and recurrently colonized northern regions during
interglacials. Such a history usually results in a loss of genetic diversity. Populations that did not experience
glaciations, in contrast, probably maintained most of their ancestral genetic diversity. These characteristics
dramatically affected the present-day distribution of genetic diversity and may influence the ability of species to
cope with the current global changes. We conducted a range-wide study of mitochondrial genetic diversity in the
pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa/T. wilkinsoni complex, Notodontidae), a forest pest occurring
around the Mediterranean Basin and in southern Europe. This species is responding to the current climate change
by rapid natural range expansion and can also be accidentally transported by humans. Our aim was to assess if
Quaternary climatic oscillations had a different effect across the species' range and to determine if genetic
footprints of contemporary processes can be identified in areas of recent introduction.
Results: We identified three main clades that were spatially structured. In most of Europe, the genetic diversity
pattern was typical for species that experienced marked glaciation cycles. Except in refugia, European populations
were characterized by the occurrence of one main haplotype and by a strong reduction in genetic diversity, which
is expected in regions that were rapidly re-colonized when climatic conditions improved. In contrast, all other
sub-clades around the Mediterranean Basin occurred in limited parts of the range and were strongly structured
in space, as is expected in regions in which the impact of glaciations was limited. In such places, genetic diversity
was retained in most populations, and almost all haplotypes were endemic. This pattern was extreme on remote
Mediterranean islands (Crete, Cyprus, Corsica) where highly differentiated, endemic haplotypes were found.
Recent introductions were typified by the existence of closely-related haplotypes in geographically distant
populations, which is difficult to detect in most of Europe because of a lack of overall genetic structure.
Conclusion: In regions that were not prone to marked glaciations, recent moth introductions/expansions could
be detected due to the existence of a strong spatial genetic structure. In contrast, in regions that experienced the
most intense Quaternary climatic oscillations, the natural populations are not genetically structured, and
contemporary patterns of population expansion remain undetected.

Background
Past climate changes have had dramatic impact on the
geographic distribution, demography, and thus the evolution of species. The contemporary distribution of genetic
diversity cannot be understood without studying how
organisms responded to climate over geological times.
Many terrestrial species are today responding to the contemporary global warming [1], and their future response
will at least partially depend on their previous reactions to
climatic oscillations. The 'genetic legacy of the Quaternary
ice ages' [2], i.e. the genetic footprint of species' responses
to glacial-interglacial successions, has been extensively
studied on many species in Europe and North-America,
that is, in the geographical regions where glaciations were
most intense [3,4]. Forest insect herbivores, such as those
associated with oaks and pines in Europe and the Mediterranean, for example, are known to have responded to
post-glacial warming with rapid range expansion northwards and eventually westwards, and to have survived glaciations in southern refugia [5-10]. The intensity of the
oscillations increased with latitude, which affected the
impact they had on species occurring through a gradient
in the so-called ORD (Orbitally forced species Range
Dynamics: see [11]).
Following Pinho and collaborators [12], we can make two
predictions. In northern latitudes, where the effects of glaciations were more severe, fewer and smaller patches of
suitable habitat were left for the survival of populations
across multiple glaciation cycles, which would have
resulted in overall lower diversity, and a lower number of
differentiated lineages in northern than in southern areas.
Moreover, the effects of climatic changes on the effective
population sizes were more dramatic in northern than in
southern regions, meaning that northern populations
should bear the signature of a rapid demographic expansion following the climate amelioration, whereas southern populations should evidence marks of more stable,
long-term effective population sizes.
Going further, Dynesius and Jansson [11] have predicted
differential evolutionary consequences depending on the
intensity of the ORD, and these predictions were empirically demonstrated for some taxa. Species that survived a
strong ORD during the Quaternary, i.e. species occurring
at higher latitudes, were selected for increased vagility and
generalism. Dispersal-related traits should have been optimized during the northward progression because high
mobility provided an elevated fitness within populations
that were tracking a moving habitat. In the same way, generalists (in terms of habitat, host, or diet) had a smaller
risk of their niche disappearing. Over evolutionary times,
the selective pressures are likely to have changed, with dispersion and generalism favoured during interglacials, and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/220

less so during glacial periods when the species were
restricted to suitable refugia.
The effects of differential intensities of glaciations on the
evolution of the species, described above, are expected for
mainland species for which the tracking of acceptable
environments through migration was possible. The situation was drastically different for species or populations on
islands situated beyond dispersal range, for which any
change had to be endured locally, either by altitudinal
shifts or by the evolution of local adaptations. Moreover,
smaller effective population sizes could have resulted in
loss of genetic diversity due to genetic drift. In this case,
evolution on islands may have been more rapid than the
rate of change on continents [13], and island populations
are thus expected to be highly differentiated from both a
genetic and an ecological point of view.
Species or populations that experienced marked climatic
oscillations in the past can be seen as a selected assemblage of geographically mobile and latitudinally-independent organisms that are likely to be best adapted for
the future climate changes, unless human activity precludes such an option [13]. Yet, comparing the phylogeographic patterns of species occurring over a latitudinal
gradient is not straightforward, as other important factors
such as life-history traits, ecological requirements, and
dispersal ability will probably differ among species. Moreover, data on current modifications to distribution ranges
due to global changes are also required to link differential
Quaternary histories to present-day evolution.
Here, we present a range-wide genetic study of a circumMediterranean insect taxon: the winter pine processionary
moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa/wilkinsoni species complex), which develops mainly on pine species (Pinus spp.).
It is a serious forest pest as it can cause heavy defoliations
of pines in Mediterranean countries. T. pityocampa has a
typical winter larval development [14]. Adults lay eggs on
pine leaves in summer, and larvae feed from needles during fall and winter. They pupate in the soil in late winter
or early spring, and newly emerged adults disperse to
reproduce during summer. Larvae are gregarious and
develop in a typical silk shelter. Ecological and genetic
data based on mitochondrial and nuclear markers suggest
that the species exhibits clear sex-biased dispersal, as
females are poorer fliers than males [15,16]. It is present
on both the northern and southern rims of the Mediterranean Basin as well as in the Middle-East (Figure 1), that is,
in regions where the impacts of glaciations varied in
intensity. Glacial cycles were probably most intense in
temperate Europe, while ice sheets are believed not to
have occurred in southern Mediterranean countries, nor
in the Near East. Populations of the pine processionary
moth are currently believed to belong to a species com-

plex including two congeneric taxa: Thaumetopoea pityocampa and T. wilkinsoni. The differentiation between these
two species was recently shown [17], and the monophyly
of T. wilkinsoni populations in the near East was confirmed [16].
Current global changes can affect the genetic patterns of
the pine processionary moth in different ways, and superimpose new signatures on existing natural phylogeographical structure. An increase in mean winter
temperatures in Europe is known to drive moth expansion
northward and to higher altitudes, in regions where hosts
are available, by providing suitable conditions in places
were larvae could not previously have survived [18]. And
if environmental conditions are suitable for the insect's

development, new pine plantations can also increase the
potential range of the pest by offering hosts in places
where they were not previously available. Contemporary
changes in the moth's distribution range can proceed
either from a natural, non-assisted expansion of insect
populations into newly suitable habitats, or from longrange dispersal that is likely to be human-aided (accidental transportation of adults or larvae, or transplantation of
buried pupae when mature trees are planted). In cases of
natural expansion, we expect a gradual loss of diversity
away from the native range (e.g., [10,19]), while long-distance, assisted introductions should result in a discontinuous distribution of genetic diversity. A recent study of the
range-wide genetic structure of the oak gall-wasp Andricus
kollari showed that the patterns observed in England were

consistent with the hypothesis of man-aided, long-distance introductions [7].
The aim of our study was to infer the Quaternary history
of the species complex over its whole distribution range,
to test if the effects of Quaternary climatic oscillations can
be differentially detected in the different parts of the
range, and if any impact of global change can be detected
and interpreted in the light of the species' evolutionary
history. Both mitochondrial and nuclear markers are useful to reconstruct the evolutionary history of a species
complex. Although nuclear markers such as AFLPs and
microsatellites were previously developed for this species
[15-17], we were not able to use them in this range-wide
study because of homoplasy and because of the occurrence of null alleles in divergent clades. We thus present
data based on mitochondrial DNA alone. As female dispersion is the limiting factor for species expansion, inferring the history of female lineages provides a good
indication of species dispersal. Yet, potential biases due to
the use of mitochondrial markers alone, such as the selective sweep that can be caused by bacterial symbionts [20],
as well as the limits inherent to single gene phylogenies,
should be acknowledged.

Results
We obtained 34 COI and 51 COII haplotypes. Among
these, 14 COI and 21 COII haplotypes were known from
either Salvato et al. [17] or Simonato et al. [16] and were
already available in GenBank (accession numbers
EF015538-EF015549 and EF210075-EF210097). The new
haplotypes found in the present study have been deposited in GenBank (accession numbers GQ507373 to
GQ507422). A total of 67 combined (COI-COII) haplotypes (ht) were found. The selected model of evolution
was the General Time Reversible model with gamma distributed heterogeneity of rates (GTR gamma). Interestingly, Bayes factors (BF) indicated a much stronger fit for
this model when a clock was assumed than when branch
lengths were unconstrained (BF = 142, computed as twice
the difference in logarithm of harmonic means of likeli-

hoods). This was confirmed when the performance of
models was assessed with the Bollback approach [21]. The
GTR gamma model was then used for all subsequent analyses. The specific rates were A-C: 0.144; A-G: 1.166; A-T:
0.068; C-G: 0.031; G-T: 0.019 and α = 0.152.
Phylogenetic inference and node datation
The haplotype composition of each sampled population
is given in Additional file 1 (Sampling sites, geographic
coordinates, host pine, collector and haplotype composition of each locality). The phylogenetic analysis clearly
showed that the T. pityocampa - wilkinsoni complex was
structured in three strongly supported clades (Figure 2). A
first group of 23 ht clustered all sequences corresponding
to T. wilkinsoni [16] together with the ht found on the
island of Crete. This 'wilkinsoni clade' was the sister group
of all other ht. A second clade of 13 ht was restricted to
Libya, Tunisia (including the nearby Italian island of Pantelleria) and North Algeria ('Eastern North Africa clade',
hereafter ENA clade). The third clade comprised 24 European ht, from Spain and Portugal to Greece (with the
notable exception of Crete), together with the 7 ht found
in Morocco and South Algeria. It will hereafter be referred
to as the 'pityocampa clade'. The main nodes were dated by
Bayesian inference using a Yule prior and the estimates are
given on the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2) and in Table 1,
with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The split between the
wilkinsoni clade and the 2 others was ca. 7.5 Million years
ago (Myrs; 95% CI 5.8 - 9.3), while the separation of the
pityocampa vs. ENA clades was dated back to 6.7 Myrs (4.9
- 8.6). The age of the most recent common ancestor
(MRCA) of the wilkinsoni clade was estimated to 5.3 Myrs
(3.7 - 7.1) while that of the ENA clade was ca. 3.1 Myrs
(2.1 - 4.3) and that of the pityocampa clade was estimated
to 2.3 Myrs (1.6 - 3.1).

Further geographic structure was found within the three
main clades. In the wilkinsoni clade, 4 distinct sub-clades
were found with very high support values (Figure 2). The
Cretan sub-clade formed the sister group of all other ht.
The Cypriot ht were the sister group of the North & West

Estimates were obtained by assuming a coalescent prior of constant size or exponential growth and by including all the sequences of each given subclade. Names are the same as in Figure 2.

Turkey sub-clade and of the sub-clade grouping the ht
from East Turkey, Lebanon and Israel. The ENA clade was
divided in 3 sub-clades corresponding to the 3 countries
in which the larvae were sampled. The Libyan ht formed a
sister group relative to the North Algerian and to the Tunisian sub-clades. Finally, the pityocampa clade was comprised of five strongly supported geographical groups.
Haplotypes from the island of Corsica appeared as the sister-group of the four remaining sub-clades: (i) the Iberian
Peninsula, (ii) North Morocco, (iii) South Morocco &
South Algeria and (iv) the Rest of Europe. Interestingly, 16
individuals sampled in Spain and 2 individuals from
western Turkey had "Rest of Europe" haplotypes (Figure
3).
Time of most recent ancestor (tMRCA) of each sub-clade
was estimated by Bayesian inference including all the
individuals of a given group and assuming a priori either
a constant population size or an exponential growth.

However, the rate of exponential growth resulted to be
positive, with an associated 95% confidence interval
excluding 0, for the Rest of Europe only (g = 6.2 10-5 yrs-1;
95% CI: 6.2 10-6 - 1.4 10-1 yrs-1); tMRCAs obtained with an
exponential prior are reported only for this group (Table
2). Keeping in mind that our use of a rate from phylogenetics studies will bias estimates upwards, estimated ages
for tMRCA resulted to range from 532 000 years ago for
North Morocco to 90 000 years ago for Rest of Europe.
Haplotype distribution and haplotype network
Haplotype networks were reconstructed for each of the 3
main clades, and haplotype distributions were mapped
(Figure 3). The haplotype networks recovered the same
strong geographical patterns as the phylogenetic tree.
Within the wilkinsoni clade, most ht were found in a single
population, except ht 5J (found throughout Lebanon and
Israel and shared by 91 individuals), and ht 4N, 12R and
12K that each occurred in two populations (see Addi-

Finally, the pityocampa clade was divided into the 5 subclades found on the phylogenetic tree. The network of the
Rest of Europe sub-clade was star-shaped (which is typical
for expanding populations), with one main ht shared by
ca. 74% of sampled individuals and all other ht diverging
from it by only one or two mutations. Haplotype 1G was
restricted to central and southern Italy. Interestingly, all
other haplotypes in Europe were rare, shared by 6 individuals at most and usually endemic to one population. In
the Iberian Peninsula, ht 29BA was found in 57% of individuals and in all populations but Gibraltar and two
southern sites. None of the other sub-clades in the pityocampa group showed a star shape.
Within population, gene diversity H and nucleotide diversity per site π are given in Additional file 1. Fu's Fs and
Tajima's D were estimated and tested within each of the
12 sub-clades except for the Libyan group as it was composed of only 6 individuals. Both indices were significantly negative only in the Rest of Europe sub-clade (see
Figures 2 &3 and Table 3). Mismatch analyses were consistent with the sudden expansion model for this subclade (SSD = 0.00298, P = 0.746) and showed a unimodal
distribution that closely fit the expected distribution. In
this sub-clade, τ was estimated to 1.77 (95% CI: 0 - 4.20),
and the corresponding expansion was thus estimated to
date back ca. 147 000 years (95% CI: 0 - 348 261 years).

Discussion
Overall phylogenetic patterns around the Mediterranean
Basin
The pine processionary moth is currently understood to
consist of a species complex containing two taxa, namely
Thaumetopoea pityocampa and T. wilkinsoni [16,17]. Surprisingly, the thorough sampling we obtained clearly
proved that the species complex is composed of three
rather than two main clades, as the populations from ENA
appeared as the monophyletic sister group of the pityocampa clade (Figure 2), and the wilkinsoni clade (including
populations from Crete) as the sister group of the ENA
and pityocampa clades. Determining the taxonomic status
of the clusters identified here is beyond the scope of the
present study, and would need complementary data such
as nuclear markers and morphological data. For this reason, we will hereafter mention three clades (the pityocampa clade, the ENA clade and the wilkinsoni clade)
without further discussion of their taxonomic level.

Another striking result is that the species complex is
ancient, and predates the Quaternary by a few million
years. In a previous study, the divergence between

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/220

Thaumetopoea pityocampa and T. wilkinsoni was estimated
to 4.5 - 5.2 Myrs [17]. That result was obtained from a limited sampling, in which only the European clade of T. pityocampa (as the population from Spain contained only
European haplotypes rather than Iberian ones) and one
Turkish population of T. wilkinsoni were analyzed. In the
study presented here, a thorough sampling of populations
(including the Cretan lineage of wilkinsoni, as well as most
sub-clades of pityocampa and the previously unknown
ENA clade) and a Bayesian approach taking into account
the gamma-distributed heterogeneity of rates, allowed us
to obtain a different estimate for the age of the main evolutionary events. In particular, the split between the
wilkinsoni and the pityocampa-ENA clades was dated on
average to 7.5 Myrs, with a confidence interval of 5.8 - 9.3
Myrs, which could correspond to the full opening of the
Aegean Trench ca. 9 Myrs ago [4,22]. Interestingly, within
the wilkinsoni clade, the estimates of node ages we
obtained were very similar to estimates obtained previously using codon-partitioned models [16]. While we did
not have enough a priori evidence to calibrate our own
molecular clock, it should be noted that, by using the universal rate, the divergence of Crete from all the other
wilkinsoni haplotypes was dated back to about 5.3 Myrs,
which corresponds to the Messinian salinity crisis and the
time when the Mediterranean Sea was at its lowest level,
thus making the colonization of islands easier [23]. Node
ages should, however, always be interpreted with caution,
given that a single mitochondrial locus was used [20].
The differentiation between the pityocampa and the ENA
clades was unexpected, and cannot be explained by classical barriers to gene flow such as mountain ranges or fragmentation of suitable habitats. Similar patterns of EastWest genetic differentiation have occasionally been found
in North Africa for other organisms [24-27], but were estimated to date back to various times, from 1.6 to 12 Myrs.
A range of hypotheses have been proposed by the authors
to explain the abrupt genetic differentiation within species in this region. They invoked either climatic scenarios,
with the rapid alternations of arid and humid periods acting as a spatially structuring force in this region during the
Quaternary; or biogeographical scenarios such as the formation of the Straits of Gibraltar after the Messinian salinity crisis, the split of the Tellian (Tell) Atlas at the Sicilian
Channel, or the more ancient formation of the Neo-Pyrenees. Indeed, the pine processionary moth depends on
the presence of pine hosts for development, and it is
known to be susceptible to summer aridity and excessive
heat [28]. Moreover, it was recently shown that barriers of
moderate altitude can hamper gene flow in this species
[29]. Finally, the species also exhibits large among-population variation in term of reproductive phenology [28]
that permits the adaptation of populations to the local climatic conditions and may also limit gene flow. Thus, the

conjunction of major biogeographical events (the rise of
the Tellian Atlas) and late Tertiary climatic change (with a
possible gap in host availability during more arid phases)
could explain the split that occurred between the pityocampa and the ENA clades some 6-7 Myrs ago.
If the main divergences within the T. pityocampa/wilkinsoni
complex date from the end of the Miocene, all clades also
predate the Quaternary. Each of the identified clades thus
experienced the Quaternary climatic oscillations after they
split from a common ancestor, and the impact of ice ages
can easily be compared between these closely-related clusters.
Phylogeographical patterns and within-clade structures
Each of the three identified clades showed a strong phylogeographical structure, and was composed of 3, 4 or 5
well-differentiated sub-clades. With the notable exception
of the Rest of Europe (see below), each sub-clade was
restricted to a rather narrow geographical region. Interestingly, a vast majority of haplotypes (54 out of 67) were
endemic to one single population, and only five were
found in three or more populations. Thus, the pine processionary moth exhibits an extreme spatial structure and
a highly reduced mitochondrial female gene flow even on
a regional scale, even though results based solely on a
mitochondrial marker should be interpreted with caution.
Over most of the distribution range, the actual dispersal of
the females is thus highly limited. The main barriers to
gene flow are sea straits, mountain ranges (the Pyrenees,
Taurus Mountains, High Atlas, Saharian Atlas), or desert
regions where hosts are lacking (Libya).

Within-clade structures were all dated back to at least 1.3
Myrs (Figure 2), i.e. to the Early- or Mid- Pleistocene. One
could suggest that local ecological pressures recurrently
acted to reinforce and maintain the genetic structures
whenever gene flow had been interrupted. As migration is
very limited and cannot counteract the effects of drift,
genetic differentiation then simply increases with time,
leading to divergent lineages in different regions. Ecological factors involved in differentiation include reproductive phenology, which can prevent mating by shifting
adult emergence periods in different populations, or local
adaptation to host characteristics, which, it has been
proved, can lead to complete mortality in translocated larvae [30]. A more precise sampling in North Africa would
allow the delimitation of the exact distribution ranges of
each sub-clade, and the determination of whether contact
zones do exist between them.
Once again with the exception of the Rest of Europe subclade, a majority of the sampled populations in the natural area of the species show more than one haplotype,
even when only 5-10 individuals were sampled, and even

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/220

at the edge of the distribution or in very isolated places
such as Libya or on remote islands. Like many insects, the
processionary moth has evolved the capacity of prolonged
diapause, which allows the emergence of adults of the
same generation over several years, thus limiting the risk
of local extinction and increasing the probability of
retaining local genetic diversity. A high genetic diversity in
the southernmost populations has also been observed for
other Mediterranean insect species (e.g., [8,9,31,32]).
Interestingly, no sign of demographic expansion could be
detected in these regions, as is expected in regions where
glaciations were less intense [12]. However, one region in
the Near East is characterized by an extreme genetic depauperization as one single haplotype is present in Lebanon and Israel. This is probably linked to the very recent
origin of moth populations in this region, where pine
trees were not present before the beginning of the XXth
century except for remote relictual stands (see Simonato et
al. [16] for a detailed discussion). The moth has expanded
slowly following afforestation. Recent expansions due to
global changes are discussed below.
Europe (except the Iberian Peninsula that harbours a specific sub-clade) is characterized by a major haplotype that
occurs from the Atlantic coast to the Greek islands and
even along the Turkish border. Moreover, the Rest of
Europe sub-clade had the star-shape that is typical for
populations expanding after a demographic bottleneck
[33], and the Bayesian analyses indicated for this group a
positive exponential growth supporting a past demographic expansion [34,35]. Tajima's D and Fu's Fs statistics revealed an excess of rare haplotypes and allowed us
to reject mutation-drift equilibrium. As similar results can
be obtained from different processes (see for instance
[36,37]), we conducted a mismatch analysis that also
indicated that European populations underwent bottleneck events due to the recurrent glaciation periods and
then recurrently expanded after the retreat of the ice. Such
results are classically found for temperate and cold-sensitive species in this region [4,9,10]. The spatial distribution
of the rare haplotypes gives insights into the existence and
locality of refugial areas where the moths survived the glaciations, and possibly also the interglacials as this Mediterranean species is susceptible to both winter cold and
summer heat and aridity [28]. As for most of the European
temperate species, these moth refugia are located in the
Balkans and in Italy, as well as in the western part of the
Iberian Peninsula [4]. Our results also show that the Alps
and the North of Italy form a region with a high proportion of endemic haplotypes, thus differing from all other
regions in Europe. This could indicate that this area also
was a Quaternary refugium where part of the ancestral
polymorphism was locally retained. Interestingly, the
Alpine Arc was recently proved to be a refugial area for
Pinus sylvestris [38], which suggests that the refugial moth

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:220

populations could have survived the glacial maxima in
this region on that particular host.
With the exception of Lebanon and Israel where the moth
settled and expanded only recently (see below), our
results show contrasting patterns of evolution during the
Quaternary in the different regions of the moth's distribution range, corresponding to our expectations. In particular, populations occurring in the highest latitudes exhibit
a radically different genetic footprint to that of all other
sub-clades. If moth populations in the vast majority of the
distribution range are characterized by a strong spatial
genetic structure, a high number of endemic haplotypes
and a restricted geographical range for each identified subclade, the patterns in the Rest of Europe are completely
the opposite. In this European region, overall genetic
diversity is low; spatial genetic structure is limited as a
consequence of the large distribution of the major haplotype 1A; and this single sub-clade is distributed over one
half of the total distribution area of the species complex.
Moreover, signs of recent expansion were detected only in
the European sub-clade, that is, in the region where glacial
cycles were probably most intense. As for most European
species, endemic haplotypes and some genetic variability
can still be detected in plausible refugial areas near the
Pyrenees, in Italy and in the Balkans [4,8,13]. In the rest
of the area, the recurrent northward expansions that followed climate warming after glacial maxima were probably rapid, pioneer-like [39], and lead to a genetic
homogenization of populations. In other temperate forest
insect species, genetic diversity was also mostly retained
either in the southernmost populations [9,31], or in the
eastern regions where the impact of the Quaternary cycles
was less pronounced (as for Andricus gall wasps developing on oaks, see [5,6,32]).
Evolution of insular populations
In each of the three main clades, the most divergent subclade corresponds to an island, or to an island-like continental region. The Corsican ht are the most differentiated
within the pityocampa clade, the Cretan ht form the sistergroup of all other sub-clades within the wilkinsoni clade,
and the highly isolated moths of Cyrenaica (Libya) are
most divergent in the ENA clade. Moreover, the second
most differentiated group in the wilkinsoni clade is the
Cypriot cluster. Each of the island lineages thus diverged
from the corresponding sub-clade a long time ago (from
5.3 Myrs for the Cretan haplotypes to 1.8 Myrs for
Cyprus). On the other hand, the most recent common
ancestors for each island are much more recent (0.38 Myrs
in Crete and 0.15 Myrs in Cyprus for example). Hence, it
is not possible at this point to determine when exactly the
colonization of each island (or isolated place) occurred,
and for how long the moths have been isolated from the
continent. However, even if we consider only the esti-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/220

mated age of the MRCA (which could be overestimated
because we used a rate from phylogenetic studies, see [40],
though the use of a Bayesian coalescent prior should in
part address this problem), we can suggest that the pine
processionary moths survived locally on these remote
islands without female exchanges from the continent during few glacial cycles. As a consequence, they had to
evolve locally to cope with at least some Quaternary oscillations and environmental changes [13]. The quite recent
estimate for the age of MRCA for each island could be due
to a founder effect followed by the effect of genetic drift in
small populations [5], as well as by fixation of selected
variation. We have evidence, in the pine processionary
moth, that male gene flow have occurred between Cyprus
and the continent [16], as was suggested by the strong
genetic similarity between Cypriot and Turkish populations found with both AFLPs and microsatellite markers.
This could also be true for islands situated at moderate
distance from the continent.
Contemporary patterns in a historical context
In recent years, the distribution range of the processionary
moth has been affected by global changes, mainly
through winter warming [18] and pine afforestation.
Moreover, it is suspected that human-aided dispersal
occurs over various distances, either via 'hitch-hiking'
(passive transportation of individuals) or accidental transplantation of pupae with grown trees moved with a substantial amount of soil. The genetic signatures of these
contemporary events will be different, and may not be
easy to detect in all regions. In most regions around the
Mediterranean Basin, apart from Europe, the natural phylogeographic pattern consists of genetically diverse and
spatially structured populations. Regions with surprisingly low levels of genetic diversity (e.g. Lebanon and
Israel), or sampling sites that are genetically closely
related to geographically distant populations (e.g. site 53
in Turkey, or 69 in Algeria) can be easily identified. These
sites actually correspond to zones of recent moth expansion either following anthropogenic pine expansion, such
as in Israel or Algeria where pines were planted both in the
beginning and at the end of the XXth century, or following
the ongoing climate warming that allows insects to survive winter in places where they could not some decades
ago (site 53 near the Black Sea). Given the natural spatial
genetic structure in these regions, the recent modifications
in moth distributions due to global changes are actually
easy to track. The populations discussed above all likely
originated from the closest natural stand, and could be the
result of non-assisted moth expansion (but a better sampling in Algeria is needed to confirm this). The mitochondrial marker we used here would also be useful to identify
between-subclades female gene flow, but a nuclear marker
is necessary to track male exchanges. In most of Europe,
however, where the populations are not genetically struc-

tured in space and where overall genetic diversity is low,
probably as a consequence of Quaternary history, one
cannot distinguish recent and historical events, as contemporary expansions (proved at both higher latitudes
and altitudes, see [18]) result in the loss of genetic diversity, as in the case of rapid, leptokurtic dispersal northwards that allowed re-colonization of northern habitats
during interglacials [10,19].
The patterns are somewhat different for islands. Some harbour populations of moths that are genetically very close,
or even similar, to their closest continental neighbours.
This is not surprising for islands that are located very close
to the continent, like most Greek islands or Sicily, that can
probably be recurrently colonized from mainland
sources. A similar result was found, for example, for
rodents [41]. In contrast, one would expect the populations of Sardinia, Pantelleria, or the Balearic Islands, that
are beyond the natural dispersal range, to be highly differentiated, as are the moths from Corsica, Cyprus or Crete.
In Sardinia, pines are still very rare and, until recently, no
pine processionary moths were found on the island. In
2004-2005, pines were transplanted from Tuscany and a
population of the moth was detected the following year
[42]. Not surprisingly, the moths sampled in Sardinia all
bore the haplotype found in Tuscany, showing that the
pests were accidentally introduced with their hosts. A similar hypothesis could be invoked to explain the occurrence
of moths bearing the major haplotype 1A in the Balearic
Islands, where the moth was first detected in the 1950s
(G. Sanchez, pers. com.). The situation on the island of
Pantelleria is different as genetic data show that pine trees
(Pinus pinaster) occur naturally and exhibit a high degree
of local genetic diversity [43]. In contrast to its pine host,
the local moth population has low genetic diversity and
bears the main Tunisian haplotype, suggesting that it was
recently introduced.

tions). However, in the temperate regions of Europe, the
natural populations are not genetically structured in
space. The contemporary patterns are thus indistinguishable from historical ones as they also consist in progressions of the most widely distributed haplotypes. In
contrast, all other sub-clades occur in limited ranges and
are strongly structured in space, as is expected in regions
that did not experience Quaternary cycles of glaciations.
In these areas, genetic diversity has been retained in most
populations, and each haplotype is usually found in only
one population. The genetic signatures of recent moth
introductions/expansions in these regions can be easily
detected: recent expansions are characterized by the loss
of genetic diversity across whole regions (e.g. Lebanon
and Israel), and recent introductions are typified by the
existence of closely related haplotypes in geographically
distant populations. A strong differentiation is also
expected for island populations if the island colonization
occurred naturally in geological times. Thus, the occurrence (or not) of a significant 'natural' genetic structure of
populations will determine whether or not recent expansions or introductions can be detected in the genetic data.
Complementary data based on polymorphic nuclear
sequences would now be useful to compare biparental
and maternally inherited markers, and to detect how male
dispersal may have influenced the global evolutionary
history of the species. Finally, our findings could be interesting for pest control as individuals present in different
clades or sub-clades may have evolved different ecological
characteristics (dispersal ability, host adaptation, egg size,
resistance to parasitoids or pathogens), which can affect
pest management strategies. Phenotypic traits should now
be measured within each phylogenetic clade and subclade and compared between regions to test this hypothesis.

Methods
Conclusion
We conducted a range-wide study of genetic diversity in a
species complex occurring across regions in which Quaternary oscillations differed in intensity - or were absent. We
have clearly shown that the sub-clade distributed over
Europe had a phylogeographical pattern typical for species that experienced marked glaciation cycles. Refugial
areas, where genetic diversity was retained and where
endemic haplotypes were found, were identified in Italy,
in the Alps and in the Balkans. All other populations were
characterized by the occurrence of one main haplotype
and by a strong reduction in genetic diversity, as is
expected in regions that were rapidly re-colonized by a
limited number of migrants when climatic conditions
improved. We have ecological evidence that the moth
populations are currently experiencing an expansion due
to global change (both climate warming and host planta-

Moth sampling
Eggs and larvae of Thaumetopoea pityocampa and T. wilkinsoni were collected in 51 different locations from 16 countries in Europe and around the Mediterranean Basin. In
addition, data from the 9 populations studied in Salvato
et al. [17] and the 14 populations from Simonato et al.
[16] were updated with newly sampled individuals and
used here. The complete data set thus consisted of 74 populations (see Additional file 1 and Figure 3). Two to 26
individuals were sampled per population following a protocol described elsewhere [16], except in one locality in
Morocco where only one individual could be found.
DNA protocols
DNA was extracted using a salting-out procedure [44].
Two mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragments, corresponding to parts of the COI and COII genes, were ampli-

fied from 732 individuals and analyzed by SSCP, as
described in Salvato et al. [17]. For each mobility class, 15 individuals were sequenced to check for the accuracy of
SSCP analysis and to determine the corresponding haplotype. Sequences were aligned using ClustalX [45].
Sequences of COI (263 bp) and COII (341 bp) fragments
were then concatenated, resulting in a 604 bp-long final
alignment.
Data analyses
A partition homogeneity test was performed for the COI
and COII fragments using Paup*4b10 [46]. The test confirmed that these regions contained homogeneous signals
(p = 0.15), allowing data to be pooled for further analyses.

Model selection was performed using a Bayesian framework, through comparison of Bayes factors [47]. In addition, model performance was assessed using a posterior
predictive test [48]. Models tested were selected using a
modified version of Hierarchy 1 in MrModeltest 2.2 [49],
enforcing or not a molecular clock. Given the limited
length of the fragment analyzed and the correlation
between proportion of invariant sites and the parameter
alpha of the gamma distribution [47], we decided not to
consider the invariant+gamma models.
For Bayes factors calculation, likelihoods for a given
model were estimated using MrBayes v3.1.2 [50], and harmonic means were used as estimators of the overall marginal likelihood of the model. Each MrBayes analysis was
the result of two independent chains of 2.106 generations,
incrementally heated with T = 0.15. Convergence was
assessed by computing the potential scale reduction factor
with sump in MrBayes. Differences between Bayes factors
obtained from the different models tested, calculated as
twice the difference in the logarithm of harmonic means
of likelihoods, were compared with reference values from
Kass and Raftery [51].
For model performance assessment we chose as discrepancy variable the multinomial test statistics [52]. Posterior
predictive distribution was evaluated through MonteCarlo simulations of 1,000 datasets for each model using
posterior densities of model parameters (tree topology,
branch lengths and substitution parameters) inferred by
MrBayes. MAPPS software [21] was used for simulations.
The discrepancy between observed test statistics and simulated predictive distributions in the various models was
quantified using Bayesian p-values [48] and the L-criterion proposed by Laud and Ibrahim [53], both computed
with MAPPS.
Relationships between haplotypes and molecular dating
were estimated by Bayesian inference of phylogeny using
Beast v1.4.8 [54]. The model of sequence evolution and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/220

clock assumptions followed the results obtained from previous analyses and a Yule prior on the tree was assumed
[55,56]; Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) was run for
10 million generations, results being logged every 1,000
generations. After discarding the first 10% of the chain,
convergence was checked by monitoring traces of sampled
parameters and effective sample size following authors'
suggestions. Analyses were cross-checked with MrBayes
and the time of the most recent common ancestor
(tMRCA) of selected clades was determined, assuming a
sequence divergence rate of 2% per million years [57], and
reported as a mean value with 95% highest posterior density interval (HPD).
For the most recent nodes, demographic Bayesian analyses were performed separately for each of the identified
sub-clades using Beast and including all the sequences of
a given group. Assumptions and settings were the same as
above, except that coalescent priors of constant size and of
exponential growth were used instead of Yule priors, and
that two MCMC runs of 100 million steps were performed. tMRCAs of recent sub-clades were estimated
assuming a 2% divergence, and must therefore be interpreted as the maximum age for a given sub-clade [40].
The phylogenetic reconstructions allowed us to identify
three highly supported monophyletic clades within which
a statistical parsimony network was computed using TCS
v1.21 [58]. Such a network estimates genes genealogies
from DNA sequences following the method described in
Templeton et al. [59].
Gene diversity H and nucleotide diversity per site π were
calculated within populations and within previously
identified sub-clades. To infer whether each sub-clade has
experienced recent population expansions, Tajima's D
and Fu's Fs statistics were calculated and tested with
DnaSP 4.10 [60]. Mismatch distributions of the pairwise
genetic differences [61] were then performed using Arlequin 3.1 [62] and their goodness-of-fit to a sudden expansion model was tested using parametric bootstrap
approaches (1000 replicates). The sum of squared deviations (SSD) between the observed and expected mismatch
distributions was used to assess the significance of the test.
Mismatch analyses were also used to estimate the approximate timing of expansion in the sub-clades where mutation-drift equilibrium was rejected. We used the
relationship τ = 2ut [61], τ being the age of expansion
measured in units of mutational time, t the expansion
time in number of generations, and u the mutation rate
per sequence and per generation. This last value was calculated using the relationship u = 2 μk, with μ the mutation rate per nucleotide and k the length of the sequence
in nucleotides. The 2% pairwise sequence divergence
defined by DeSalle [57] was used to approximate μ.
