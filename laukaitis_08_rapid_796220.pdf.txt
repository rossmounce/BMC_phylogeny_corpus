Abstract
Background: The draft mouse (Mus musculus) genome sequence revealed an unexpected
proliferation of gene duplicates encoding a family of secretoglobin proteins including the androgenbinding protein (ABP) α, β and γ subunits. Further investigation of 14 α-like (Abpa) and 13 β- or γlike (Abpbg) undisrupted gene sequences revealed a rich diversity of developmental stage-, sex- and
tissue-specific expression. Despite these studies, our understanding of the evolution of this gene
family remains incomplete. Questions arise from imperfections in the initial mouse genome
assembly and a dearth of information about the gene family structure in other rodents and
mammals.
Results: Here, we interrogate the latest 'finished' mouse (Mus musculus) genome sequence
assembly to show that the Abp gene repertoire is, in fact, twice as large as reported previously, with
30 Abpa and 34 Abpbg genes and pseudogenes. All of these have arisen since the last common
ancestor with rat (Rattus norvegicus). We then demonstrate, by sequencing homologs from species
within the Mus genus, that this burst of gene duplication occurred very recently, within the past
seven million years. Finally, we survey Abp orthologs in genomes from across the mammalian clade
and show that bursts of Abp gene duplications are not specific to the murid rodents; they also
occurred recently in the lagomorph (rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus) and ruminant (cattle, Bos taurus)
lineages, although not in other mammalian taxa.
Conclusion: We conclude that Abp genes have undergone repeated bursts of gene duplication and
adaptive sequence diversification driven by these genes' participation in chemosensation and/or
sexual identification.

Background
Approximately 90% of genes in the dog (Canis familiaris),
mouse (Mus musculus), and human (Homo sapiens)
genomes have been preserved without duplication, disruption or deletion, since their last common ancestors
[1,2]. The remaining ~10% of genes, representing the volatile portion of the mammalian gene complement, in general possess functions that are very different from those of
the conserved gene set: they are substantially enriched in
functions contributing to chemosensation, reproduction,
immunity, host defense and toxin degradation [3]. Moreover, gene families, such as those containing olfactory or
vomeronasal receptors, immunoglobulin domain-containing proteins, or cytochromes P450 that are expanded
in one lineage are often expanded in another. This likely
reflects similar evolutionary responses to similar environmental challenges.
Some among us contributed to initial analyses of the draft
mouse genome assembly [2] by identifying mouse-specific gene duplications that remained unduplicated in the
human genome. We argued that such genes contribute
disproportionately to biology that is specific to the rodent
lineage [3]. One of these mouse-specific clusters includes
homologs of the α-subunit of the androgen-binding protein (ABP) which was of particular interest owing to evidence that ABP mediates sexual selection in mice [4,5].
Others among us have investigated the biochemical,
genetic, molecular and physiological functions, and evolution of ABP molecules since the 1980s. These investigations revealed that the ABP heterodimer consists of an αsubunit (encoded by the Abpa gene), disulfide-bridged to
either a β- or a γ-subunit (encoded by Abpb or Abpg; [6,7]),
and that Abp genes evolved rapidly, potentially because of
positive selection [7-11]. In common with all other members of the secretoglobin family to which they belong,
ABP subunits have not unequivocally been assigned
molecular functions [12-15].
Upon combining our research efforts, we first performed
a more detailed comparative analysis of Abp gene
orthologs in the mouse, rat (Rattus norvegicus), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and human draft genome assemblies
[8]. These analyses established that Abp sequences, present
within human and chimpanzee regions of conserved synteny, have acquired disruptions to their reading frames
and these are highly likely to be pseudogenes. Mouse Abp
genes appear to have been subject to positive selection
with coding sequences acquiring greater numbers of
nucleotide substitutions than their introns. Surprisingly,
mouse Abpa and Abpbg genes were found all to be monophyletic with respect to families of orthologs from either
rat or wood mouse (Apodemus). This is consistent with
multiple duplications of Abpa and Abpbg genes occurring
independently in each of the mouse, rat and Apodemus lin-

eages, and with the genome of the last ancestor common
to rodents and primates containing only single versions of
Abpa and Abpbg genes. It is also consistent with the presence, in the cat genome, of single adjacent Abpa and Abpbg
orthologs, whose protein products form a heterodimer
termed Fel dI [16]. In a subsequent study, we investigated
the spatiotemporal expression of seventeen Abp genes,
and concluded that differential expression patterns of
mouse Abp genes reflect an animal's gender and sexual
maturity status [17].
The mouse genome assembly is substantially improved: it
is now essentially complete and is of high accuracy
(Mouse Genome Sequence Finishing Consortium, submitted). The draft mouse genome previously analyzed
(NCBI build 30, mm3; [8] contained four large (>5 kb)
gaps, into which we now realize fall many hitherto unrecognized Abpa and Abpbg paralogues. We were interested in
whether these paralogues arose more rapidly than the
genome-wide average, for primates and rodents, of 1
duplicate gene fixed per hundred million years [18].
In the absence of genome sequences from more closely
related species, we sequenced Abpa homologs from three
Mus musculus subspecies (M. m. domesticus, M. m. musculus
and M. m. castaneus) and three other species within the
genus Mus (M. spretus, M. caroli, and M. pahari – see Fig. 1
for a phylogeny). M. musculus and M. spretus represent the
Palearctic clade, M. caroli is an Asian species serving as an
outgroup to the Palearctic species, whereas Mus pahari
(a.k.a. Coelomys; [19]) serves as an outgroup to the subgenus Mus; these species all diverged from a common ances-

tor more than seven million years ago [20]. Our finding of
single M. pahari orthologs of multiple Mus musculus Abpa
genes thus supports the rapid duplication of these Mus
genes within the last seven million years.
As the common ancestor of murid rodents appeared to
contain only a single pair of Abp genes and because gene
duplication events are relatively rare, we predict that single Abpa-like and Abpbg-like genes will also be present in
the genomes of most other eutherian mammals, and of
metatherians, such as the opossum (Monodelphis domestica). The recent availability of draft assemblies of many
species' genomes [21] provides an opportunity to investigate this prediction. While our methodology provides
slight underestimates of the numbers of Abpa and Abpbg
paralogues and precludes definitive assignment of predicted sequences as genes or pseudogenes, here we report
identification of the expected single pair of Abpa and
Abpbg genes in genome assemblies for multiple diverse
mammals. Interestingly, we identified considerably more
such paralogues in two mammals, rabbit and cattle, hinting that Abp genes have been the substrate for frequent
duplication in lineages beyond the murid rodents.

Results
Rodent gene predictions and nomenclature
We revisited the Abp region of the mouse (C57BL/6J
strain) genome sequence considering that a recent assembly (mm8; February 2006) might contain genes that had
been hidden within the gaps of the 2002 initial draft
assembly (mm2). We report that this region is now free of
sequence gaps. By comparing new (mm8) and old (mm2)
genome assemblies we identified 41 Abp genes in a large
(~1.8 Mb) contiguous segment that had presented difficulties when originally assembled (Figure 2). The mouse
Abp gene region is now seen to be 3 Mb in size, approximately twice as large as previously estimated, and 6-fold
larger than estimated for the orthologous region in rat [8].

Abp genes were originally described as Abpa (alpha subunit; A), Abpb (beta subunit; B) and Abpg (gamma subunit;
G), based on the identification of the three ABP subunits
in two different dimeric combinations: AB and AG [6].
The three genes were mapped on the proximal end of
mouse chromosome 7 in a study that also demonstrated
that Abpb and Abpg are closely related, both in exon/intron
structure and in sequence [7]. When it became apparent
that multiple copies of Abpa and of Abpb/Abpg exist in the
genomes of mouse and rat, with 5'-5' orientations of pairs
of Abpa and Abpbg, the nomenclature was modified to represent Abpb and Abpg as Abpbg genes [8].
The mouse Abp region contains a total of 30 Abpa and 34
Abpbg genes or pseudogenes (see Additional files 1 &2 for
cDNA sequences and gene locations), over twice the num-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/46

bers we reported previously [8]. In the report that follows,
we distinguished the Abpa paralogues obtained from the
mouse genome from those we derived from wild-derived
rodent taxa by designating them "B6" (an abbreviation of
C57BL/6, the source strain for the mouse genome
project). New B6 paralogues reported here are designated
in bold typeface. Twelve of the 30 Abpa genes and 19 of
the 34 Abpbg genes have missense or nonsense mutations
in an exon, while four Abpa and three Abpbg paralogues
have non-canonical splice sites (all marked as pseudogenes on Figure 2; details in Additional file 2). We recognize that pseudogenes that possess full-length open
reading frames are mis-assigned as functional genes by
this method. It is also possible that one or more of those
we have designated pseudogenes could be expressed. Of
note is the paralogue B6_bg2 (previously numbered
Abpbg2 [8]), which has a deletion eliminating a conserved
stop codon that allows the protein sequence to be
extended by two extra amino-acid residues before ending
in a non-conserved stop codon. We have assigned this paralogue gene status because we have identified transcripts
by RT-PCR for this gene in numerous tissues [17] and
have found at least 10 Mus musculus ESTs for this slightly
longer version in the Mus musculus EST database
(CK616889 and others). Others working on Swiss-Webster mice reported a different change at the 3' end of this
paralogue (AY370634), supporting the possibility of
strain-specific polymorphisms within this gene.
Consistent with previous observations, the majority of the
newly-predicted genes are located in Abpa-Abpbg pairs,
and are likely to be transcribed in opposite, head-to-head
(i.e. 5'-5') arrangements. Our original gene sequence and
pair assignments are likewise essentially unchanged from
our initial report [8]. We number the Abpa and Abpbg paralogues by their sequential occurrence in Abpa-Abpbg gene
pairs along the chromosome (i.e., B6_Abpa1-B6_Abpbg1,
B6_a2-B6_bg2, etc.; Figure 2) despite this resulting in the
reassignment of some gene names (see Additional file 2
for current and previous designations).
The Abp gene cluster in other rodent taxa
The most recent rat genome assembly (rn4; November
2004) contains only three Abpa-Abpbg gene pairs in a
region spanning ~0.2 Mb of chromosome 1 (RNO1),
which is ten times fewer than the Abp genes distributed
over ~3 Mb of the syntenic region of mouse chromosome
7 (MMU7). Originally, we reported that one of the six rat
paralogues was a pseudogene [8]. However, we have since
discovered a cDNA with a single base sequence change in
that gene which eliminates a frameshift mutation resulting from an additional A nucleotide in a run of A's (Laukaitis and Karn, unpublished). Although this region of the
rat genome assembly contains many gaps (including 5
contig gaps) there is no evidence, as there was for previous

sequences for additional Abp gene paralogues.
A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the second
introns (of length ~800 bp) available from the mouse
(genome: "B6"), rat (genome), Apodemus, M. m. domesticus, M. m. musculus, M. m. castaneus, M. spretus, M. caroli
and M. pahari (Figure 3; see Additional file 3 for intron
sequences). As noted in Materials and Methods, this is the
first report of intron sequences from Apodemus. The Abpa
genes in Mus musculus, Apodemus and Rattus cluster separately into three monophyletic clades, indicating that the
mouse, Apodemus and rat Abp gene complements arose by
duplication independently from single Abpa or Abpbg
genes in the last common ancestor; this is consistent with
our previous results [8]. However, whether these rodent

Abp gene duplications were relatively contemporaneous,
or whether they were more uniformly distributed over
time, remained unclear.
To deduce the pace of gene duplication in the Mus musculus lineage, we used PCR to obtain Abpa gene sequences in
closely-related rodent species (see lineage in Figure 1).
Thereafter, we used Southern blotting to interrogate
genomic DNA from different rodent taxa using Abpa
probes from M. m. domesticus and M. pahari paralogues.
We chose to focus on Abpa genes, because extensive
repeats of single bases in Abpbg introns ([7] and Karn,
unpublished) make it difficult to amplify and sequence.
Since most Abpa genes are paired with single Abpbg genes,
our results are also relevant to Abpbg genes. The effectiveness of each of these methods necessarily depends on the

evolutionary divergence between Abpa probe sequences
and the other rodent taxa being studied. Such approaches
resulted in the identification and partial sequencing of
two Abpa genes in M. pahari, six in M. caroli, and five each
in M. spretus, M. m. castaneus, M. m. musculus, and M. m.
domesticus.
By manually reconciling the known species phylogeny
(Figure 1) with a phylogeny of these genes and pseudogenes (Figure 3), we deduce that many of the 30 mouse
genome Abpa genes and pseudogenes arose by duplications within the Mus subgenus clade. The basal positions
of each of the Rattus, Apodemus or M. pahari clades indicate
that the last common ancestor of Mus, Apodemus, and Rattus contained only one Abpa gene. The last common
ancestor of the Mus subgenus with M. pahari contained at
minimum two and at maximum five Abpa genes since the
Abpa genes from the Mus subgenus (M. m. musculus, M. m.
domesticus, M. m. castaneus, M. spretus, and M. caroli) form
five well-separated clades, and each of the two M. pahari
Abpa genes serves as an outgroup to one of these clades.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/46

reduced dramatically in more distant taxa of the subgenus
Mus, especially at higher stringency levels, reflecting
sequence divergence. Bands in three taxa outside the subgenus Mus (M. pahari, the outgroup to the subgenus; Apodemus, the outgroup to the genus Mus; and Rattus, the
most distantly related, Figure 4A), were faint at low stringency and disappeared altogether as stringency was
increased.
The two M. pahari genes we identified allowed us to
develop Southern blotting probes to further investigate
the relationship of M. pahari paralogues to those discovered in the subgenus Mus. Two separate experiments,
using probes developed from each of the M. pahari paralogues, produced nearly identical patterns of eight bands
in the M. pahari lane and few or no bands in other taxa
(Figure 4B). Conversely, probing M. pahari genomic DNA
with the M. m. domesticus probes revealed only one band,

The six Abpa genes from M. caroli, the most distant species
of those we investigated in the subgenus Mus, are all outgroups to the other Abpa (pseudo)genes from the subgenus. For all but two of these genes, the branching order is
consistent with the species phylogeny without lineagespecific duplication events. For M. caroli Abpa7, the
branching order supports the origin of eight mouse
genome in-paralogues (B6_a7, a11, a12, a13, a18, a19,
a20 and a29; these are all newly reported here except
B6_a29 which was previously referred to as Abpa13 [8])
after the splitting of the M. caroli and M. musculus lineages
(Figure 3). We calculate that these duplication events
occurred between 400,000 and 2.8 million years ago,
although the low divergences for introns from some of
these paralogues suggest even more recent duplication
events. We considered, and eventually discarded, the possibility that gene conversion has caused the low divergence of these intron sequences. For the B6_a27 clade
(previously reported as Abpa11[8] and, originally, Abpa
[6]), two M. caroli paralogues cluster as outgroups, suggesting a M. caroli-specific duplication event. B6 duplications within this clade occurred between 1 and 7 million
years ago.
Southern blotting
The patterns produced by probing Southern transfers of
DNA from the three subspecies of M. musculus with a variety of Abpa-derived probes are essentially indistinguishable, independent of probe or subspecies (Figure 4). This
consistency suggests that much of the extensive Abp gene
expansion seen in the C57BL/6J genome ([8] and this
paper) was present in the common ancestor of these subspecies approximately 0.5 MYA. Pattern intensity was

again reflecting sequence divergence between genes from
the taxa. The Apodemus and Rattus lanes contained no distinguishable bands at higher stringency, as was the case
when probed with M. m. domesticus probes.
Abp genes found in the genomes of other mammals
We previously predicted that the last common ancestors
of mouse and rat, and of mouse and human, possessed
only a single pair of Abpa-Abpbg genes [8]. We sought to
test this prediction by identifying Abp genes in the available assembled genome sequences of seventeen additional
mammalian species that sample divergent eutherian lineages, one metatherian, and one monotreme species [22].
Abpa or Abpbg orthologs were identified for 12 of these
species (Figure 5; see Additional files 1 &2 for cDNA
sequences and contig assignments). Supporting our prediction, no more than a single Abpa or Abpbg gene was
found for ground squirrel and guinea pig, both of which
are rodents. Similarly, single gene pairs, at most, were
found for four species (little brown bat, horse, dog, and
cat) whose lineages arose prior to the last common ancestor of primates and rodents. We conclude the earliest
eutherian possessed only a single pair of Abpa and Abpbg
genes.

The last common ancestor of the eutherian and metatherian lineages 180 MYA possessed both Abpa and Abpbg
genes. Three Abpa and three Abpbg subfamily members are
evident in the metatherian Monodelphis genome sequence
although many of these, owing to their divergence, were
unable to be predicted in their entireties. Two Monodelphis
Abpa genes appear to have arisen from duplication within
the metatherian lineage, as evidenced by their relatively
low divergence at synonymous sites (KS = 0.06). Abp
genes, on the other hand, were not detected in the draft
platypus genome, but we cannot exclude that sequence
divergence disfavours their prediction using the methods
we employed. Alternatively, Abp genes may simply lie
within the ~10% of its genome that is absent from the current assembly.
By way of contrast, the genomes of two further species
each contain independent expansions of Abp genes. The
rabbit genome assembly contains 43 Abpa or Abpbg
sequences, whereas the cattle genome assembly contains
18 such homologs. Abpa-Abpbg gene pairs are observed in
head-to-head (5'-5') arrangements on 7 and 4 occasions
within cattle and rabbit contig sequences. Rabbit gene
paralogues are more closely related (maximum KS = 0.16)
than they are to closely-related orthologs in other species
(guinea pig or squirrel minimum KS = 0.78 and KS = 0.97,
respectively). Similarly, cattle paralogues are more closely
related (maximum KS = 0.49) to each other, than they are
to their dog or cat orthologs (minimum KS = 0.74 and
0.51, respectively). We infer, therefore, that expansions of

Materials and Methods. Results for macaque and platypus are
not shown owing to the absence of evidence for Abp genes in
their current genome assemblies.

Abp genes have occurred independently in the cattle and
rabbit lineages.
In the macaque genome assembly, we were able to identify neither an Abpbg exon 1 (which is all that is discernible
in the human and chimpanzee genome assemblies [8]),
nor an Abpa gene. Although it remains possible that Abpa
and Abpbg genes or pseudogenes fall into gaps that are
present in the syntenic region of the current macaque
genome assembly, evidence for these homologues was
also not forthcoming from searches of the macaque trace
sequence reads. We are yet unable, therefore, to delineate
definitively the time-points in the primate lineage at
which Abpa and Abpbg genes acquired deleterious mutations.
We determined that the numbers of Abp genes present in
the 2-fold coverage genome assemblies represented reliable estimates and were not adversely affected by largescale duplications confounding the accurate assembly of
trace sequence reads. For each species we aligned the
nucleotide sequences of Abpa genes' second exons with all
available trace sequences using MegaBLAST. For those 2fold coverage genome assemblies (for armadillo, tree
shrew, squirrel, microbat and cat) with only single Abpa
(pseudo)genes, only 5.6 traces on average (range 2–14),
were returned (representing, on average, 6.4 × 10-7 of

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:46

sequences in the trace archive for these species). For rabbit, by contrast, 140 traces were returned, on average (representing 1.5 × 10-5 of rabbit sequences in the trace
archive). The trace archive thus contains evidence for
approximately 20-fold more Abpa genes or pseudogenes
in the rabbit genome than present in the genomes of tree
shrew, squirrel, microbat and cat despite these all, including rabbit, having been sequenced at 2-fold coverage. Further evaluation to confirm ascertainment of all gene
copies by synteny-based methods is not possible with
low-coverage genomes owing to contigs not being placed
on chromosomes.
Positive selection on Abpa and Abpbg paralogs in various
species
The presence of sites under positive selection was established for either Abpa or Abpbg genes from all mammals
we considered, using a log likelihood ratio test comparing
paired models M7/M8 and M1/M2 (see Additional file 4).
Tests for positive selection were significant for both paired
models for Abpbg genes (P < 10-18). We were especially
interested to learn whether positively selected sites
("ω+sites") in one lineage map onto equivalent sites in
other lineages. For Abpbg paralogues among all species
investigated, we identified 34 ω+ sites (Figure 6B). Of
these, 21 are coincident with the sites we described previously for mouse Abpbg genes [8], 13 sites have not been
observed previously, and seven of the original 28 sites
found in mouse Abpbg paralogues were not found in this
analysis. Considering Abpbg paralogues only from the
mouse genome, 16 of 19 sites are coincident with those
we described previously [8]. For cattle Abpbg paralogues,
we found 10 ω+ sites, four of which are shared with
mouse. Two rabbit Abpbg ω+ sites were found, one of
which is shared with mouse. For Abpa paralogues (Figure
6A), we were unable to detect strong evidence of positive
selection: M1/M2 test did not show evidence of selection
(P > 0.25), while the M7/M8 test was highly significant (P
< 10-23). One of the three potentially positively-selected
sites on Abpa is consistent with [8] (Figure 6A). Sites
undergoing positive selection were mapped onto the protein structure of cat allergen Fel dI [16]. Consistent with
previous results [8], positively-selected sites were located
almost exclusively on the molecules' surface and away
from the dimerization interface (see Additional files 5, 6,
7, 8, 9 for locations of selected sites).
Expression of Abp paralogues
We searched for ESTs corresponding to each of the 30
Abpa and 34 Abpbg paralogues we report here. Each of nine
Abpa sequences and nine Abpbg sequences corresponded
to at least one report of an EST detected in at least one tissue (Table 1). Given the large number of mouse Abp paralogues, it is surprising that we were able to find ESTs
corresponding to so few of them. Nonetheless, some of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/46

the new Abp paralogues we report finding in the mm8
mouse genome build are among these (B6_a3, B6_a7,
B6_bg7, B6_a12, B6_bg12, B6_a20, B6_bg20). The a27,
bg27 and bg26 paralogues correspond to the alpha, beta
and gamma subunits of ABP, respectively, originally discovered and described by Karn and his colleagues as
expressed in mouse salivary glands [23-25] and subsequently shown to be under the control of independent
genes [6,7,9] located on mouse chromosome 7. The other
paralogues are associated with ESTs expressed variously in
brain olfactory lobe [17], lacrimal gland [17,26], major
olfactory epithelium [17], ovary [17], prostate [17,27],
testis [28], skin [29] and vomeronasal organ [17], however no corresponding proteins have yet been described.

Discussion
The Abp gene region within the finished mouse genome
assembly
The finished mouse genome assembly (mm8) establishes
the ~3 Mb Abp gene region as one of the most rapidlyevolving genomic sequences known. Compared with the
rat, with which it shared a last common ancestor only
approximately 12–24 MYA [30,31], the region has
expanded 6-fold and has accumulated, by multiple duplication events, 10-fold more Abpa or Abpbg (pseudo)genes
(Figure 2). The large number of evolutionarily very recent
duplications generated many virtually identical sequence
regions that proved impossible to assemble for the initial
mouse draft genome (mm2).

Although we have, thus far, only considered gene duplication, the homogeneity of Abpa genes we observe might
also have arisen because of non-allelic gene conversion, as
previously observed for interferon-alpha [32] and globin
[33] genes, for example. Nevertheless, we discount this
explanation by inspecting the phylogenetic tree of ribosomal protein L23a pseudogenes (see Additional file 10),
which frequently appear to have co-duplicated with AbpaAbpbg gene pairs (Figure 2); these duplications are of
recent origin since similar sequences are absent from the
syntenic region in the rat. As the phylogenies of the pseudogenes and their associated Abp genes (Figure 3) are topologically equivalent, Abpa-Abpbg gene pairs appear to
have arisen primarily by duplication, presumably via nonallelic homologous recombination, rather than by
sequence homogenization after non-allelic gene conversion events. Despite expectations that mammalian genes
are duplicated and fixed once every 100 million years, and
acquire inactivating mutations after approximately 7 million years [18], we observe a highly-unusual expansion of
a gene family from 5 to 30 members within only 7 million
years.
We previously observed expression of six Abpa paralogues
and five Abpbg paralogues in ten glands and other organs

located predominantly in the head and neck (olfactory
lobe of the brain, three salivary glands, lacrimal gland,
Harderian gland, vomeronasal organ, and major olfactory
epithelium; [17]). We positively identified PCR products
in this expression study by comparing their sequences to
those of the paralogues from which the primers were
developed. Nonetheless, because the new paralogues'
sequences are often closely-related to those used to
develop the expression primers, we identified, using the
UCSC genome browser's in silico PCR resource (February
2006 assembly), which of the new paralogues that would
have been amplified with these primers, were they
expressed. Only the original Abpa13 (now B6_a29) primer
pair [17] amplified additional paralogues beyond that for
which they were designed. The Abpa13 primers amplified
two new B6 Abpa paralogues in the in silico PCR experiment (B6_a7 and B6_a20). However, the sequencing
check of the PCR products in that study (described above)
did not provide evidence that these new paralogues were
expressed in any of the tissues that were positive for the
original Abpa13 paralogue. Thus the results and conclusions reported in our original report [17] do not appear to
warrant revision.
Expression of Abp paralogues
We find evidence for expression of nine Abpa and nine
Abpbg paralogues that are nearly equally divided between
paralogues we originally reported [8,17] and new ones
reported here (Table 1). Most expressed paralogs are
found in pairs, where both partners of the pair are

expressed. Surprisingly, we identified non-canonical
splice sites in four paralogues previously amplified from
cDNA collections by RT-PCR (B6_bg3, B6_a21, B6_bg25
and B6_a26; previously Abpbg12, Abpa5, Abpbg9, and
Abpa10 [8]) and two newly-reported paralogues (B6_bg3
and B6_a26). We found a single incident of non-canonical splice site changes in other taxa where the Mus spretus
paralogue, spr a26, has the same non-canonical GT-AG
change at the beginning of its second intron as B6_a26.
More difficult to interpret are the ESTs (CN843804.1 and
BY706510) that others have reported for B6_bg23 in testis,
because the genome sequence for that paralogue has an
early termination codon in the coding region. We aligned
the B6_bg23 coding region with those EST sequences and
verified the early termination codon in both ESTs (not
shown). These unusual changes could be strain-specific
changes (e.g. between C3H/HeJ and C57BL6/J) or very
new pseudogenization events where control regions have
not yet acquired mutations that silence transcription.
Either scenario would illustrate the rapid speed at which
evolution has shaped this region.
Expansion of the Mus musculus gene cluster is rooted at
the level of the subgenus Mus
We combined computational data with two experimental
methods to explore the origin of the complexity of the Abp
gene cluster within rodent taxa. Paralogue sequences
derived from the mouse genome could not be definitively
assigned to a single subspecies because of multiple M.
musculus subspecies contributions to the C57BL/6J

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:46

genome [34,35]. Thus, we used PCR-based gene finding
data to determine sequences for many (although certainly
not all) Abpa paralogues in the genus Mus. Evolutionary
analysis of these sequences groups the two M. pahari paralogues as outgroups of clades formed by paralogues of
the subgenus Mus. Neither of the two paralogues that we
found in Apodemus nor any of the three Abpa genes found
in the rat genome shows this property, suggesting that the
impressive gene family expansion seen in Mus musculus
began in an ancestor common to M. pahari and the subgenus Mus. Further, interrogating Southern blots with
probes developed from the two M. pahari paralogues
revealed other M. pahari paralogues that were not seen
when the blots were probed with M. m. domesticus probes
and that were not discovered in the PCR-based gene finding experiments. These could reflect an expansion of the
Abpa gene cluster that is, at least in part, unique to M.
pahari. This suggests that the common ancestor of M.
pahari and the subgenus Mus possessed a cluster of genes,
some of which may have been duplicated separately in
both the subgenus Mus and M. pahari lineages and some
of which may have been expanded in the M. pahari lineage
alone. In the event that their sequences become available,
the additional bands in M. pahari Southern blots may be
associated with other clusters of subgenus Mus paralogues. While there may be as yet undiscovered Apodemus
lineage-specific paralogues, these would not be close relatives of Mus genes owing to our inability to detect them by
either of the methods we used.
The genome of the last common ancestor of Mus and M.
pahari harbored only approximately five Abpa genes. This
conclusion is drawn from the branching orders of the two
sequenced M. pahari Abpa genes and the 30 mouse
genome Abpa genes and pseudogenes (Figure 2; Figure 3).
Of five clades, two possess M. pahari genes as outgroups,
flanking numerous Mus-specific genes as ingroups. The
genes from each of the five clades lie in contiguous
genomic sequence (Figure 2) implying that sequence
duplications of Abpa (and, by inference, their partner
Abpbg genes) generated neighboring tandem duplications.
From the Abpa phylogeny (Figure 3), and from their order
on the chromosome (Figure 2), we predict that of the five
Abpa genes predicted to be in the common ancestor of
Mus and M. pahari one duplicated to generate B6_a1 and
B6_a2 (formerly Abpa1 and Abpa2 [8]), a second duplicated on numerous occasions leading to B6_a3-23 (all
herein are new paralogues except B6_a21-23 which were
previously numbered as Abpa5-7 [8]) and B6_a28-29 (previously Abpa12 and Abpa13), a third and a fourth (corresponding to B6_a24 and B6_a25; formerly Abpa8 and
Abpa9 [8]) remained unduplicated, and the fifth duplicated to yield B6_a26-27 and B6_a30 (formerly Abpa10-11
and Abpa14 [8]), all in the Mus lineage and within an estimated time span of 7 MY.

Deletion, as well as duplication, events are likely to have
shaped this region of the mouse genome. Establishing evidence for this is more problematic for unassembled
genomes for which it is unknown whether the absence of a
gene represents a deletion or simply a lack of sequencing of
that region. However, we reject the possibility that rapid
birth and death (pseudogenisation) processes are sufficient
to explain our striking finding of independent expansions.
First, searches of the trace server archives failed to find additional sequences whose high duplication content confounds assembly. Second, the ability of our prediction
algorithms to identify divergent genes and pseudogenes (KS
> 0.97 between rabbit genes and their single ortholog) in
distant species provides confidence in their ability to identify even rapidly evolving genes. Third, we have found evidence for retained, but potentially pseudogenized genes
that have changed splice sites. Thus, the speed of evolution
of this genomic region would not be expected to result in
removal of all inactive paralogous gene copies. Nevertheless, in those lineages that have experienced much gene
duplication, it is likely that many deletions of genes, by nonallelic homologous recombination, have also occurred.
The picture arising from these data suggests a fascinating
scenario in which Abp duplications occurred independently in the three lineages leading to Rattus, to Apodemus
and to Mus. This was followed by a more complex evolutionary history in the genus Mus, in which at least two
Abpa genes further duplicated to produce additional paralogues in the subgenus Mus lineage while other paralogues duplicated independently in the M. pahari lineage.
Additionally interesting points include: 1) M. caroli
appears to have duplicated its Abpa27 paralogue independently of the other species, suggesting that unique
gene duplications may have taken place in some lineages
of the subgenus; 2) An orthologue of Abpa30 was
observed in each species we investigated, in spite of the
fact that it is one of the few Abpa paralogues unpaired with
an Abpbg in the mouse genome and is a pseudogene; 3)
The M. m. musculus Abpa27 paralogue unexpectedly lies
outside the M. spretus node. This was described previously
by Karn et al. [11], who noted an unexpected resemblance
between the Palearctic species (M. m. musculus excluded)
when comparing divergence levels between an Abpa
intron and single copy number DNA. They hypothesized
that this pattern was due to secondary genetic exchanges
along the lineages leading to the Palearctic species.
Independent expansions of Abp have occurred in nonrodent taxa
Our prediction of Abp genes in Monodelphis demonstrates
that these were not a eutherian invention, but were
present in the last common ancestor of eutherians and
metatherians, approximately 180 MYA. The presence of,
at most, one Abpa or Abpbg gene in most eutherian

Page 11 of 17

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:46

genomes is most parsimoniously explained by only single
versions of these genes in the genome of the earliest eutherian mammal. This single Abpa-Abpbg gene pair appears
to have been conserved in active form in most mammalian lineages (e.g., cat and dog), but was silenced by pseudogenization in primates (represented in this study by
bushbaby, chimpanzee and human). By contrast, Abp evolutionary history in Mus, Rattus, Apodemus, rabbit and cattle lineages is characterized by rapid and independent
expansions of these gene families by gene duplication,
with some of the paralogues remaining active and some
likely being silenced.
We believe it unlikely that the large numbers of gene predictions in the rabbit assembly arose solely because of
errors arising from two-fold statistical coverage. The
nucleotide error rate and heterozygosity present in the
animals sequenced, taken together, are insufficient to
explain the high number of sequence-different paralogues
we found. Indeed, the ~74% genome sampling from twofold coverage sequencing [36] should result in an underestimate, not an over-estimate, of the gene count. Finally,
in this study we have inspected a large number [13] of
two-fold coverage genome sequences, all of which have
been sequenced and assembled using similar methods,
and yet for these we often observe either one or no paralogues. In particular, we discount the possibility that the
two-fold coverage genome of rabbit might, by chance,
have sampled a single locus to generate a total of 38
sequence-distinct Abpa sequences (Figure 5).
Mouse is the only organism in which an extensive survey
of Abp gene expression has been performed [17]. Expression of many Abpa and Abpbg paralogues were noted, primarily in glands of the face and neck. Expression in the
organs otherwise appeared to be restricted to prostate and
ovaries; only a single EST has been found in mouse skin.
The single Abpa/Abpbg gene pairs in the house cat (Fel dI;
[37]) and, possibly, the dog [38] are expressed in salivary
glands and sebaceous glands of the skin. Both the cat [39]
and the mouse [5] coat their pelts with Abp during grooming. Cattle Abp sequences and similar sequences in sheep
and goat have been found in skin EST libraries (see Additional file 11). Skin glands are known to be pheromone
sources in cattle [40] and the minimal Abp gene expression in mouse skin suggests that this source has been supplanted in rodents by the complex, multi-gland
expression in the face and neck [17]. ABP thus provides
the potential to present an olfactory profile for an animal
of the same or a closely related species. In primates, however, these genes are conspicuously silent, suggesting a
shift to a reliance on visual cues.
It is clear that Abp genes have diverged widely through
evolutionary time, both in sequence and in gene copy

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/46

number, and remain under the influence of positive selection, which has shaped the gene family in rodents. Other
gene families shaped by positive selection include those
involved in chemosensation, pathogen defense and sexual identification [3]. We previously proposed that Abp is
involved in chemosensation and/or sexual identification
[4,5]. Different organisms have devised different physiological mechanisms for accomplishing this function [41]
and this is reflected in the evolutionary history of the relevant genes (e.g., lineage-specific duplications in V1R
vomeronasal receptors [42-44]). Both the finding of different positively-selected sites in different organisms with
Abp expansions, as well as the independent gene duplication events, reflect the effect these diverse mechanisms of
evolutionary adaptation have exerted on Abpa.

Conclusion
We identified 30 Abpa and 34 Abpbg genes or pseudogenes
in a 3 Mb region of mouse chromosome 7. These genes
occur in pairs that have arisen primarily by independent
bursts of tandem duplication from approximately five Abp
genes found in the last common ancestor of the subgenus
Mus. At least one Abpa and Abpbg gene was present in the
last common ancestor of eutherians and metatherians,
approximately 180 MYA, and this single Abpa-Abpbg gene
pair has been conserved in active form in most mammalian lineages, but was silenced by pseudogenization in primates. By contrast, Abp evolutionary history in Mus,
Rattus, Apodemus, rabbit and cattle lineages is characterized by rapid and independent expansions of these gene
families by gene duplication, with some of the paralogues
remaining active and some likely becoming silenced. Abp
genes have diverged widely through evolutionary time,
both in sequence and in gene copy number, and remain
under the influence of positive selection.

Methods
Predicting Abpa and Abpbg genes from the finished mm8
mouse genome assembly
Using CLUSTALW [45], we constructed multiple sequence
alignments of genomic DNA encompassing the previously known mouse Abpa or Abpbg genes. These two alignments were unambiguous owing to the low divergences
among these paralogues. In order to predict additional
genes, hidden Markov models [46] were constructed from
these alignments and then compared against both strands
of the mouse and rat Abp genomic regions (mm8 for
mouse; rn4 for rat). Unusually, the prediction of highly
divergent Abp coding exons is greatly assisted by the lower
divergence of neighboring intronic sequence [8]. High
scoring alignments were re-aligned against the previous
multiple sequence alignments. Manual curation of multiple genomic DNA sequence alignments was performed to
ensure: (a) that the third exon, containing only a short
portion of rapidly evolving coding sequence, was pre-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:46

dicted correctly and without exons from different loci
being inadvertently joined in erroneous gene predictions,
and (b) that we were able to identify splice site consensus
dinucleotides.
Predicting Abpa and Abpbg genes from other mammalian
genome assemblies
The following 17 genome sequence assemblies were also
searched for the presence of Abpa or Abpbg orthologous
genes: Guinea pig (Cavia porcellus); Ground squirrel (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus); European rabbit (Oryctolagus
cuniculus); Tree Shrew (Tupaia belangeri); Bushbaby (Otolemur garnetti); Common Shrew (Sorex araneus); European
hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus); Little brown bat (Myotis
lucifugus); Cattle (Bos taurus) at 7.1-fold coverage [47]; Cat
(Felis catus); Dog (Canis familiaris) at 7.6-fold coverage;
Nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus); Lesser
hedgehog (tenrec; Echinops telfairi); African savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana); Horse (Equus caballus) at 6.8fold coverage; South American opossum (Monodelphis
domestica) at 6.5-fold coverage; and Duck-billed platypus
(Ornithorhynchus anatinus) at 6-fold coverage [48]. Except
where indicated, these data were obtained from the Broad
Institute, MA [49] and represent approximately 2-fold statistical coverage of the genomes. To these, we added our
findings on mouse, Apodemus, rat, human, chimpanzee,
and macaque (Macaca mulatta) making a total of 23 species. For a phylogeny of these mammalian species (excepting horse) see Margulies et al. [22].

Abpa and Abpbg transcripts in these genomes were predicted on the basis of homology to a set of template protein sequences (see below) using the program Exonerate
[50]. Transcript prediction proceeded in two steps: (1)
Genomic regions containing putative transcripts of Abp
were identified first using Exonerate in heuristic mode
(options: – maxintron 50000 – proteinwordthreshold 3 –
proteinhspdropoff 5 – proteinwordlen 5 – score 80); and,
(2) Transcripts were then predicted using Exonerate in
Genewise mode (-exhaustive) in all regions identified in
step 1, but extended by 150 kb on either side. Identical
predictions of transcripts were removed and overlapping
transcripts were combined into individual genes.
For each genome, prediction of Abp genes was initiated
with experimentally well-established mouse α and β/γ
peptide reference sequences (NP_987098, NP_033726,
NP_919319, and NP_840093). After a first round of gene
prediction, predictions arising from all species' genomes
were added to these four reference sequences (above), and
the entire process of gene prediction was repeated. Parameters used for Exonerate searches were optimized specifically for Abp gene predictions resulting, for each species,
in sequences with matched intron-exon boundaries. Further manual intervention ensured, for example, that dog

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/46

predictions were orthologous to those in the house cat
(Fel dI).
Exonerate often failed to predict the short third exon of
Abpa genes (~9 codons). In order to arrive at complete
transcripts, we re-predicted all transcripts with Genewise
[51] using separate hidden Markov models of the first two
exons and of the third exon. If the first two exons were successfully predicted, a search for the third exon was initiated in the 5 kb downstream segment. On success, the two
predictions were combined into a single transcript. The
hidden Markov models were constructed using HMMer
[52] from the coding sequences of the manually curated
multiple sequence alignment of the mouse and rat Abp
genomic DNA alignments (including novel predictions
from the mm8 mouse genome assembly). This step also
served as a filter for spurious predictions because those
not yielding alignments using Genewise were discarded.
Genewise exhibits a bias towards producing artefactual
undisrupted coding sequences when faced with
frameshifts or in-frame stop codons, which were likewise
culled by manual curation. In order to decrease the possibility of missing paralogues in unassembled sequence
data, we looked for additional copies with species-specific
searches of the trace archive used MegaBLAST at the
National Center for Biotechnology Information [53] and
default parameters, as well as using evidence from known
cDNA or EST sequences. This was also used to search for
evidence of expression of paralogues with non-canonical
splice sites.
Abp gene predictions in the target genome were classified
as members of either the Abpa or Abpbg family using
HMMer and HMMs derived from mouse and rat Abp coding sequences (see above). Amino acid sequences of
members of the Abpa and Abpbg families were multiply
aligned using MUSCLE [54]. Nucleotide alignments were
derived from the amino acid sequence alignment. To
clearly distinguish mouse genome Abp paralogues predicted here from those previously reported [8] and from
those derived from other species/subspecies, we designate
our current paralogues with the prefix B6, in reference to
the C57BL/6J strain whose genome has been sequenced.
Predictions with frameshifts, in-frame stop codons, or
non-canonical splice sites were labeled as pseudogenes.
Gene finding in closely-related murid rodents
Genomic DNA was obtained from Jackson Laboratories
(Bar Harbor, ME) for ZALENDE/EiJ, (M. m. domesticus),
CZECH/II (M. m. musculus), CAST/EiJ (M. m. castaneus),
M. caroli, SPRET/EiJ (M. spretus), and M. pahari. Genomic
R. norvegicus DNA was obtained from Bioline (Randolph,
MA). Apodemus sylvaticus genomic DNA was obtained
from the collections of the Department of Zoology,
Charles University in Prague.

Our strategy for gene finding involved developing primers capable of amplifying Abpa gene sequences in one or
more of a variety of rodent taxa. First, we amplified Abpa
sequences from the genomic DNAs listed above using the
primer sets we developed previously for published
mouse and rat paralogues [14,17]. Next, we performed
multiple alignments of the sequences we obtained in the
new taxa, and those identified in the mouse and rat
genomes, to identify additional unique and conserved
primer sites. Third, we made these new primer sets and
tested them on the various taxa. In the process, we also
mixed and matched forward and reverse primers from
the old and new sets for additional combinations.
Finally, we again aligned the sequences we obtained and
repeated the process.
PCR was performed with a 62°C annealing temperature
and 20 second stages for 25 cycles. Products were assayed
by agarose gel electrophoresis. Unincorporated primers
were removed using a QiaQuick PCR clean-up kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA.) and products were sequenced by MC
Labs (San Francisco, CA).
We amplified and sequenced genomic DNA from nine of
the fourteen paralogues reported by Emes et al [8] in five
taxa from the subgenus Mus, M. pahari, and Apodemus.
Sequences represented much of these genes' exons 2 and
3 and all of their intervening second intron. It should be
noted that intron sequences have not been previously
reported for Apodemus paralogues and thus the sequences
we report here should not be confused with the cDNA
sequences we used in an earlier study [8].
Evolutionary analyses
Abpa intron 2 sequences from Mus, Apodemus, Rattus, and
rabbit were aligned using CLUSTALX [55,56]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from the alignments using the
program PAUP* [57] and these were displayed in TreeView
[58]. In PAUP*, neighbor-joining distance parameters
with Jukes-Cantor correction and random-seeding were
used to calculate divergences between rodent sequences
and to create trees with proportional branch lengths. These
were compared to 1000-replicated bootstrap distance trees
to validate an essentially identical topology. The bootstrap
values from the 1000-replicate tree are related to the NJ
tree as indicated in the figure legend.

After manual reconciliation of gene and species trees, we
estimated the ages of B6 in-paralogues by normalizing
their divergences (in percent identity) to their divergence
with their inferred M. pahari or M. caroli ortholog, and
multiplying by the estimated divergence time of M. pahari
or M. caroli lineages from M. m. domesticus [20]. For example, the divergence time between a26 and a27 was calulated as:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/46

Divergence time (MYA) =

d(a26 − a27)×7(MY )
0.5((d(a26 − pah1)+ d(a27 −pah1))

where d(a26-a27) is the divergence between B6_a26 and
B6_a27, d(a26-pah1) is the divergence between B6_a26
and M. pahari paralogue 1 and d(a27-pah1) is the divergence between B6_a27 and M. pahari paralogue 1 and 7
MY is the estimated divergence time between M. m. domesticus and M. pahari (Figure 1 and [20]).
KA and KS values, synonymous substitution rates and sites
under positive selection were inferred using the codeml
program of the PAML package [59] and the F3X4 codon
model. The presence of sites under positive selection was
established for either Abpa or Abpbg genes from all mammals we considered, using a log likelihood ratio test comparing paired models M7/M8 and M1/M2. Sites were
predicted to be under positive selection if they showed a
posterior probability (BEB) of P > 0.9 in one test and at
least P > 0.5 in the other test. Polypeptide sequences were
aligned with MUSCLE [54]. The alignment was manually
checked for errors and then back-translated into nucleotide sequences, removing frame shifts and in-frame stop
codons. Rate analyses were always performed on the same
alignment; sequences not of interest for a particular analysis were simply excluded. Phylogenetic trees were estimated using the program KITSCH from the PHYLIP
package [60].
Southern transfers
2.5 μg of genomic DNA was digested with 60 Units of
EcoRI in a 100 μl reaction at 37°C for 16 hours. This
enzyme was chosen because only one of the thirty Abpa
paralogues in the mouse genome and none of the three
rat paralogues exhibited an internal restriction site. Varying the EcoRI digestion over a period of 4–16 hr had no
effect on the banding patterns we obtained, supporting
complete and specific digestion; complete digestion was
also confirmed by running 5% of the digestion on a test
gel. The digestion was stopped by adding 14 μL of 1%
SDS/100 mM EDTA and ethanol precipitated after the
addition of 14 μl of 3 M NaAc, this was resuspended in
20 μl 3× loading buffer, and separated by electrophoresis
on a 1% agarose gel in 0.5 × TBE for 2–6 hours. The gel
was denatured for 30 minutes in 0.5 M NaCl/0.5 M
NaOH. Transfer materials were pre-moistened in denaturation solution and transferred to Nytran nylon transfer membrane overnight in the same solution. Following
transfer disassembly, the membrane was neutralized for
10 minutes in 3 M NaCl/0.5 M Tris pH 7.4 and the DNA
fixed by baking at 60°C for 1 hour. The blot was prehybridized for 30 minutes at 60°C in 7% SDS/0.5 M PBS
pH 7.4/1 mM EDTA; this solution was also used for
hybridization.

Blots were probed with labeled ~200 bp PCR products
amplified from M. m. domesticus (Zalende/EiJ) genomic
DNA by PCR with primers spanning a splice junction
between exon 2 and intron 2 in B6_a2 or B6_a27 or from
M. pahari genomic DNA using similarly-located primers.
B6_a2 and B6_a27 were selected because they are located
close to the two extremities of the mouse ~3 Mb Abp
genomic region (Figure 2). Probes were labeled by random-primed incorporation of α-32P-dATP into PCR
products using a modification of the Amersham (Piscataway, NJ) Mega Prime random-primed system and protocol. For a 25 μl reaction, 10% of a 25 μl PCR reaction
was used as template and was mixed with 1 μl of each of
the original 10 μM forward and reverse PCR primers as
well as 2.5 μl of the Mega Prime random primer mix.
Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using a QiaQick PCR clean-up kit and the probe was boiled for 5
min in 5 ml of hybridization solution, followed by 2
min of incubation on ice, before being placed on the
edge of the blot and incubated at 60°C overnight. Subsequently, the blot was washed with an increasingly
stringent series of washes, using 5× to 0.1 × SSC and
0.1% SDS, which produced consistent bands with a
decrease in background at higher stringency. Blots were
exposed to Kodak x-ray film for 18 hours to 15 days
between washes and were stripped for re-probing using
two fifteen minute washes of boiling 0.1 × SSC/0.1%
SDS. Gels were scanned with a Nikon scanner and prepared for publication using Adobe Photoshop v. 7.0.
Expression analysis of Abp paralogues
The BLAST algorithm of the NCBI genome browser was
used to identify mouse ESTs, using the Abpa and Abpbg
cDNAs reported here as search strings. An EST was
assigned to a particular paralogue if it had 99+% coverage
with 100% identity.

Authors' contributions
CML designed and conducted the DNA blotting (southern transfers) and probing procedures and assisted with
experimental identification of Abp genes from rodent
DNA. AH predicted Abp genes from sequence assemblies. TB assisted in Abp gene prediction in the mouse
and other organisms. PM purified the DNA from Apodemus caught wild in the Czech republic and assisted in
the PCR experiments used to obtain Abpa gene
sequences in closely-related rodent species, including
Apodemus. CPP reconstructed the mouse Abp gene
region, using the new, gap-free mouse genome data and
assisted in gene prediction and results interpretation.
RCK (assisted by PM) developed and implemented the
PCR experiments used to obtain Abpa paralogues from a
variety of species in the subgenus/genus Mus. RCK also
assisted with Southern blotting and performed the EST
