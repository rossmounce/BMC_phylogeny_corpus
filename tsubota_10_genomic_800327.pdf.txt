in the silkworm Bombyx mori

Abstract
Background: Carboxyl/cholinesterases (CCEs) have pivotal roles in dietary detoxification, pheromone or hormone
degradation and neurodevelopment. The recent completion of genome projects in various insect species has led to
the identification of multiple CCEs with unknown functions. Here, we analyzed the phylogeny, expression and genomic
distribution of 69 putative CCEs in the silkworm, Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae).
Results: A phylogenetic tree of CCEs in B. mori and other lepidopteran species was constructed. The expression pattern
of each B. mori CCE was also investigated by a search of an expressed sequence tag (EST) database, and the relationship
between phylogeny and expression was analyzed. A large number of B. mori CCEs were identified from a midgut EST
library. CCEs expressed in the midgut formed a cluster in the phylogenetic tree that included not only B. mori genes but
also those of other lepidopteran species. The silkworm, and possibly also other lepidopteran species, has a large
number of CCEs, and this might be a consequence of the large cluster of midgut CCEs. Investigation of intron-exon
organization in B. mori CCEs revealed that their positions and splicing site phases were strongly conserved. Several B.
mori CCEs, including juvenile hormone esterase, not only showed clustering in the phylogenetic tree but were also
closely located on silkworm chromosomes. We investigated the phylogeny and microsynteny of neuroligins in detail,
among many CCEs. Interestingly, we found the evolution of this gene appeared not to be conserved between B. mori
and other insect orders.
Conclusions: We analyzed 69 putative CCEs from B. mori. Comparison of these CCEs with other lepidopteran CCEs
indicated that they had conserved expression and function in this insect order. The analyses showed that CCEs were
unevenly distributed across the genome of B. mori and suggested that neuroligins may have a distinct evolutionary
history from other insect order. It is possible that such an uneven genomic distribution and a unique neuroligin
evolution are shared with other lepidopteran insects. Our genomic analysis has provided novel information on the
CCEs of the silkworm, which will be of value to understanding the biology, physiology and evolution of insect CCEs.
Background
The carboxyl/cholinesterase (CCE) superfamily is comprised of functionally diverse proteins that hydrolyze carboxylic esters to their component alcohols and acids.
CCEs fall into three functional groups: dietary detoxification, hormone and pheromone degradation, and neurodevelopment [1,2].
The dietary detoxification group of CCEs includes
esterases that are responsible for the metabolism of a
broad range of substrates including xenobiotics in the
diet and insecticides. There is evidence that the acquisi* Correspondence: shiotsuk@affrc.go.jp

tion of insecticide resistance can arise either by mutations in CCE amino acid sequences that change the
activity of the esterase or by amplification of CCE genes
in this group [1]. Such phenomena have been observed in
many insect species including flies, mosquitoes and
aphids [1], and there might be common mechanisms for
the acquisition of insecticide resistance in these species
based on their CCEs. The hormone and pheromone
degrading group includes juvenile hormone esterases
(JHEs), pheromone degrading esterases (PDEs) and others. JHEs act to degrade juvenile hormone (JH), a sesquiterpenoid insect hormone that plays important roles in
the regulation of a number of physiological processes [35]. The active functioning of JHE at the final instar larva
is essential for normal larval-pupal metamorphosis [6].

PDEs are expressed in the adult male antenna and have a
role in the degradation of sex pheromones produced by
the female [7,8]. The degradation of the sex pheromone is
believed to be essential to enable the male to accurately
follow a pheromone trail. The third neurodevelopmental
group includes acetylcholinesterases (AChEs), neuroligins, neurotactins, gliotactins and others. AChEs are the
only CCEs of this group that are catalytically active and
they function in neurotransmission [9]. With the exceptions of Drosophila melanogaster and other higher Diptera, insects have two AChE genes that show a clear 1:1
orthologous relationship between species [1]. Neuroligins
are known to be involved in the cell-cell interactions of
synapses [10]. The functions of neuroligins are well characterized in the human, mouse and rat [11,12], while
recent studies in the honeybee, Apis mellifera, examined
the splicing and expression of insect neuroligins [13] or
revealed the genetic and functional conservation of neuroligins between vertebrate and invertebrate [14]. Not
only neuroligins but also other CCEs in this group are
catalytically inactive, as are some CCEs outside of the
neurodevelopmental group, such as glutactins and βesterases [1,15].
Recently, genome analyses have proceeded very rapidly
in a wide range of species including insects. Insects were
found to have multiple CCE genes, many of which have
unknown function [1,2,16-19]. Determination of the
functions of these genes based on sequence and homology information is infeasible. As members of the CCE
superfamily have been found in prokaryotes to vertebrates, it is clear that elucidation of the roles of the genes
in this family will have a wider biological relevance
beyond entomology. With regard to genomic analyses,
sequencing of the genome of the silkworm Bombyx mori
has now been completed and released to public databases
[20]. The silkworm is a useful model for lepidopteran
insects, and comparative analyses between lepidopteran
species can be made using the silkworm genomic information as a base. Moreover, the large body size of the
silkworm has been exploited to establish multiple tissuespecific expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries [21,22].
Integration of genomic analysis and EST expression analysis should enable a more comprehensive understanding
of the functions and evolution of many genes.
In this study, we used silkworm genomic information to
analyze the phylogeny of lepidopteran CCEs. Based on a
recent analysis of CCEs in the silkworm and Helicoverpa
armigera, another species belonging to the Lepidoptera
[23], we constructed a phylogenetic tree that included
several novel lepidopteran CCEs. To gain further insight
into the phylogeny of CCEs, we compared the expression
patterns of each CCE by a search of an EST database. A
large number of B. mori CCEs were identified in a midgut
EST library and, interestingly, these were clustered in the

Page 2 of 11

phylogenetic tree. CCEs of other lepidopteran species
that were positioned close to the cluster of B. mori
midgut CCEs were also expressed in the midgut, suggesting that their functions are conserved between species.
Additionally, we performed a comparative analysis of the
intron-exon structure of B. mori CCE genes and determined their chromosomal locations. These analyses highlighted the unique phylogenetic character of B. mori
neuroligins. Overall, our study has produced novel information on the CCEs of the silkworm and other lepidopteran insects, which will be of value to understanding
the biology, physiology and evolution of insect CCEs.

Results and Discussion
B. mori CCEs

A recent study identified 70 putative CCEs in B. mori
[23]. Our present study is largely in accordance with that
work, including the following minor exceptions. In our
analysis, BmCCE001d and 001e was dealt with as a single
gene because they have slight differences in amino acid
sequence, and a search of KAIKObase identified only one
genomic locus corresponding to them [20]; this is also the
case for BmCCE024a and 024b. On the other hand,
BGIBMGA002185 was included among putative CCEs as
our phylogenetic analysis placed this gene in the same
cluster as BmCCE030d with a bootstrap value of more
than 50% (Figure 1). Using the nomenclature system proposed by Teese et al [23], this CCE was designated
BmCCE030e (Figure 1). In total, we focused on 69 B. mori
CCEs in this study.
Construction of the phylogenetic tree of lepidopteran CCEs

A phylogenetic tree of lepidopteran CCEs is shown in
Figure 1. This tree contains CCEs of B. mori, H. armigera
and several other lepidopteran species (see Figure 1); the
CCEs of Spodoptra littoralis, Heliothis virescens and
Manduca sexta have only recently been identified [24,25].
Comparison of the relationship between B. mori and
other lepidopteran CCEs revealed that among 69 B. mori
CCEs 21 appeared to have a 1:1 orthologous relationship
with CCEs of other lepidopteran species, while others not
(Figure 1).
Although Teese et al [23] proposed 33 major clades for
insect CCEs, the phylogenetic tree produced here after
inclusion of additional CCEs suggested that several of
these clades could be merged. The integration of clades
001 and 002 as clade 001*, clades 003 and 023 as clade
003*, clades 012 and 013 as clade 012*, clades 028 and 029
as clade 028*, and clades 007-011 and 033 as clade 007*
was supported with a bootstrap value of greater than 50%
(Figure 1).
One striking characteristic of B. mori is the presence of
a much greater number of CCEs compared to species in
other insect orders [23]. Analysis of CCE phylogeny has

shown that a large cluster containing clades 001*, 004007* and others are Lepidoptera-specific (Additional file
1). These clades contain more than 30 B. mori CCEs (Figure 1, Additional file 1)). CCE clusters specific to nonlepidopteran orders have also been identified [2,18,19];
however, none of these clusters contains as many CCEs as
those in the Lepidoptera for B. mori. This suggests that
the abundance of CCEs in B. mori (and possibly in other
lepidopteran species) is related to the existence of this
large Lepidoptera-specific cluster.

To further investigate the functions of B. mori CCEs and
the relationships between CCE phylogeny and expression
profile, we searched a silkworm EST database to identify
the tissues in which each CCE was expressed. In total, the
search found 354 EST clones with homology to CCE in
libraries from larval or pupal tissues; these clones corresponded to 47 CCE genes (Tables 1 and 2). A summary of
the expression patterns of the CCEs is given in Figure 1.
Recently, we described the developmental expression
profiles of several CCE genes [26]. The EST database
search here showed good agreement with the results of
this earlier analysis of developmental expression patterns.
Thus, for example, multiple clones of JHE were found in
the fat body library (Figure 1), consistent with the high
level of expression of jhe in the fat body of the final instar
stage larva [26,27]. Similarly, EST clones of CCE011a/b
(CCE-4A/B) were present in a range of tissues (Figure 1)
and were previously shown to be expressed in these tisTable 1: Frequency distribution of B. mori CCE genes based on the

sues [26]. Such consistency was also obtained for
CCE014a (CCE-5AL/AS) and CCE014b (CCE-5BL/BS)
(Figure 1, [26]), further supporting the validity of our EST
expression analysis.
The largest group of EST clones was identified in the
larval midgut library: 104 of the total 354 clones came
from this library, and they corresponded to 23 CCEs (Figure 1, Table 2). The majority of the midgut CCEs
belonged to lepidoptera-specific phylogenetic clades (Figure 1, Additional file 1)), suggesting that the large number
of silkworm CCEs (and possibly of other lepidopteran
species) might be a consequence of this large number of
midgut CCEs. Overall, however, B. mori had slightly
fewer midgut CCEs than H. armigera [23]. This might
reflect differences in feeding behavior of the two species:
B. mori is monophagous, while H. armigera is polyphagous. In addition to the midgut, the analysis of the EST
cDNA libraries showed expression of CCEs in the corpora allata, silk gland, ovary, brain, pheromone gland,
wing, fat body, hemocyte, and testis (Table 2). In D. melanogaster species subgroup, it is known that a CCE
expressed in the male ejaculatory duct is transferred to
the female via the semen during mating and that this CCE
stimulates egg laying behavior and inhibits the receptivity
to remating in the female [28]. It is possible that B. mori
CCEs expressed in the male testis have similar functions
although the precise expression pattern might be different. However, in most cases, the functions of CCEs in
each tissue are unknown.

Relationship between CCE expression profile and
phylogeny

We sought to determine if there was any relationship
between CCE phylogeny and patterns of expression in tissues. Many of the CCEs in clade 001* were confirmed to
be expressed in the midgut (Figure 1). Although the CCEs
of S. littoralis in this clade were derived from an antennal
EST library [24], it might be possible that they are also
expressed in the larval midgut. CCEs of subclade 001 are
considered to be catalytically active, and one of their possible roles is the detoxification of noxious substances in
the diet. By contrast, CCEs of subclade 002 lack the catalytic serine residue and are presumed to be inactive,
although they might bind to substrates in the midgut.
Expression of catalytically inactive CCEs of clade 021 was
also found in the midgut (Figure 1).
Many of the B. mori CCEs in clade 006 were expressed
in the midgut (Figure 1). Likewise, CCEs of clade 006
from several other insect species are also expressed in the
midgut (Figure 1, [23,25,29]). On the basis of these
results, we named clade 006 "larval midgut esterases of
unknown function", a designation different from that
used by Teese et al [23]. It should be noted that
BmCCE006c and 006d are mainly expressed in the silk
gland, suggesting that novel CCEs closely related to these
silk gland proteins might be identified in other lepidopteran species in the future. As no clone of
BmCCE006n was found in the midgut library, and the
other CCEs of subclade 006n originated from the
antenna, we tentatively excluded this subclade from "larval midgut esterases of unknown function" (Figure 1).
In contrast to the CCEs described above, those in clade
007* were derived from various tissues (Figure 1). Subclades 008 and 010 included CCEs from antenna
[24,30,31]. Currently, it is not known whether
BmCCE008a and BmCCE010a are expressed in the
antenna; nevertheless, it is still possible that subclades
008 and 010 form an antennal CCE cluster. By contrast,
BmCCE011a/b are expressed in various organs (see
above). Thus, CCEs in this cluster might have a universal
function rather than a tissue-specific role. BmCCE011a
and 011b have been shown to be alternative splicing
products of the same gene and to share a 62 amino acid
sequence at their N-termini [26]. Interestingly, SlCXE8
and SlCXE18 also have a common 62 amino acid
sequence at their N-termini, indicating that such alternative splicing might be conserved among lepidopteran species.
Among the CCEs of clade 014, BmCCE014a and 014b
are also splicing variants of the same gene [26].
BmCCE014a is expressed strongly in the midgut and
Malpighian tubules, and this gene showed strong activity
for degrading 1-naphthyl acetate (1-NA), a general
esterase substrate [26]. Interestingly, the H. armigera

Page 5 of 11

homologue, HaCCE014a, is also expressed in the midgut
and also has the ability to degrade 1-NA [23], suggesting
that not only expression but also function of CCEs in this
clade is conserved between species.
Four B. mori CCEs are located in clade 016 (Figure 1);
none were confirmed to be expressed in the midgut. This
outcome is consistent with a previous analysis of the
expression profile of BmCCE016c (CCE-1) and
BmCCE016 d (CCE-2) [26]. Other insect species, however, have homologous CCEs that are expressed in the
midgut (Figure 1). Thus, the expression patterns of CCEs
in this cluster might not be conserved among species.
CCEs of clades 018, 024 and 026 appear to be expressed
ubiquitously (Figure 1), suggesting they might have universal roles, in a similar manner to CCEs of subclade 011.
One exception is Antheraea polyphemus PDE of clade
026, which is specifically expressed in the adult male
antenna [7]. In contrast, the B. mori homologue,
BmCCE026a, is expressed in various tissues (Figure 1).
This may reflect functional differences between these
CCEs, possibly related to species differences with respect
to usage of sex pheromones. The sex pheromones of A.
polyphemus are ester compounds while those of B. mori
are a mixture of an alcohol and an aldehyde. However, S.
littoralis is also known to use ester compounds as sex
pheromones, but SlCXE13, the putative counterpart to A.
polyphemus PDE, surprisingly shows ubiquitous expression [24]. One possible explanation is that the A. polyphemus PDE has a specified function for the degradation of
the sex pheromone, while SlCXE13 has functions in addition to pheromone degradation.
Intron-exon organization

Next, we investigated the intron-exon organization of B.
mori CCEs. In total, 240 introns were identified in the B.
mori CCEs. Four CCEs were intronless (Figure 2), the
remainder had one to thirteen introns each (Figure 2).
The average intron size was 1372 nucleotides. The longest intron was present in BmCCE027b and comprised
13962 nucleotides located between exons 2 and 3.
BmCCE020c, BmCCE020d and BmCCE025a contained
the shortest introns of 68 nucleotides. Such intron size
variations are similarly observed in B. mori glutathioneS-transferases (GST) [32]. The intron size distribution in
B. mori CCEs is shown in Figure 3. The lengths of the
introns showed an approximately even distribution.
We mapped the positions of introns in B. mori CCEs by
the multiple sequence alignment (Figure 2). There was a
clear and strong conservation of intron positions among
the CCEs, as was also observed for B. mori GSTs (Figure
2, [32]). We also classified the splice sites into three
phases according to their positions in the codons: phase 0
for a splice site lying between two codons, phase 1 for a
splice site lying one base inside a codon in the 3' direc-

tion, and phase 2 for a splice site lying two bases inside
the codon in the 3' direction. We then examined the distribution of these three splice site phases and found that
not only the position of the intron but also the splice site
phase was strongly conserved (Figure 2). The most conserved intron was a phase 2 intron at position 1368; this

was present in 45 CCEs (Figure 2, arrowhead). A phase 0
intron at position 229 or 230 was also present in 20 CCEs,
respectively (Figure 2, arrow). Fifty-seven B. mori CCEs
contained one or both of these introns (Figure 2), indicating that these arose at an early stage of CCE evolution. In
addition to these two introns, others were also conserved

in several clades. Phase 2 introns at positions 787 and 865
were conserved in all CCEs of clade 020 (Figure 2, red
brackets), a phase 1 intron at position 1022 was present in
5 CCEs of clade 013 and 024-026 (Figure 2, orange brackets), and a phase 0 intron at position 1165 was present in
all CCEs of clade 030 (Figure 2, purple bars). On the other
hand, 3 intron positions are conserved in all CCEs of
clade 20, and 4 introns are conserved in 3 CCEs of this
clade (Figure 2). Such a clade-specific strong conservation of intron phase and position was also observed for B.
mori GSTs [32]. Interestingly, CCEs of clades 024-026
and 030 had a phase 1 intron at positions 792 and 861
(Figure 2, green brackets), despite their distant locations
in the phylogenetic tree (Figures. 1 and 2). As described
below, these two introns were also conserved in the neuroligins of D. melanogaster and A. mellifera. Totally, we
found 21 intron positions that are conserved in more
than 2 B. mori CCEs.
Chromosomal locations of CCEs in the silkworm

Examination of the chromosomal locations of silkworm
CCEs showed these were distributed unevenly across the
genome (Figure 4). A more detailed representation of the
genomic structure of the clusters on chromosomes 25
and 23 is shown in Figure 5. Six CCEs on chromosome 25
are in the same orientation, while four CCEs on chromosome 23 vary in orientation (Figures. 4 and 5). This clustered distribution pattern has also been observed for
silkworm GSTs [32]. The chromosomal clusters of CCEs
of clades 016 and 020 indicate that they arose through a
recent duplication. In addition to these clades, other
CCEs showed clustering on the silkworm genome and, in
many cases, also showed clustering in the phylogenetic
tree (Figures. 1, 2 and 4). A recent study found evidence
of conserved microsynteny in Lepidoptera [33,34]. It is
possible that a similar phenomenon occurs with regard to
CCE chromosomal clusters in other lepidopteran insects.
Genomic clustering of CCEs has also been observed for
non-lepidopteran insects such as D. melanogaster and

Page 7 of 11

Nasonia vitripennis [1,18]. In D. melanogaster a large
CCE cluster has been identified on chromosome 3R [1];
however, neither B. mori nor N. vitripennis have such a
large CCE cluster (Figure 4, [18]). On the other hand,
there are several differences between the chromosomal
locations of CCEs in B. mori and N. vitripennis. CCE clusters in N. vitripennis tend to be localized around centromeric regions [18], whereas in B. mori, the clusters were
frequently observed close to the telomeric regions (Figure
4). Another difference is that while the three functional
classes of CCEs are respectively clustered in the chromosomes of N. vitripennis [18], no such functional clustering
was observed in B. mori CCEs (Figure 4).
We also analyzed the relationship between the chromosomal location of B. mori CCEs and the tissues in which
they were expressed. In some cases, adjacently located
CCEs were expressed in the same tissue; for example,
CCE006g, 006h and 006j were expressed in the midgut,
and CCE006c and 006d were expressed in the silk gland
(Figures. 1 and 4). This might indicate that these CCEs
were born via a recent duplication event. However, CCEs
located adjacently are not always expressed in the same
tissue; such CCEs are probably regulated by independent
enhancers/promoters that have distinct activities, despite
their close chromosomal locations. Disagreement
between chromosomal location and expression pattern
has also been reported for silkworm cuticular protein
genes [35]. Such CCEs might have distinct functions in
the silkworm.
Analysis of phylogeny and microsynteny in neuroligin
genes

Finally, we investigated the phylogeny and chromosomal
locations of neuroligins, genes in clade 30 in the phylogenetic tree, in more detail (Figure 1). Every insect genome
examined to date contains multiple neuroligin-like
sequences, and phylogenetic analyses have indicated that
these sequences are highly conserved [2,13]. Moreover, it
was also reported that vertebrate and invertebrate neuroligins are conserved genetically and functionally [14].
Our analysis of the B. mori genome identified five putative neuroligins, CCE030a-e (Figures. 1 and 2). We constructed another phylogenetic tree using the sequence
data for the five B. mori neuroligins, four D. melanogaster
neuroligins, five A. gambiae neuroligins and five A. mellifera neuroligins (Figure 6A). Each species had at most
one CCE in each neuroligin subcluster, while B. mori had
two CCEs in the Nlg-4 subcluster (Figure 6A), the first
evidence of a neuroligin duplication event in the Insecta.
Although a CCE corresponding to Nlg-1 could not be
identified in B. mori, BGIBMGA002170, which showed
very weak homology to other insect Nlg-1s, is a candidate
homologue. BGIBMGA002170 was not located in the
same clade as other neuroligins in the phylogenetic tree

Figure 4 Chromosomal locations of silkworm CCE genes. The length of each chromosome is drawn to scale. CCEs that are clustered on chromosomes and the phylogenetic tree (Figures. 1 and 2) are colored purple. CCE019a, 024c and 029a were located in a scaffold whose chromosomal location is unknown and is not shown on this figure.

Figure 5 The organization of the CCE cluster around CCE020 and
016 in the silkworm genome. Six CCEs are clustered around CCE020a
on chromosome 25, along with one additional gene
(BGIBMGA000789) (A); four CCEs are in a cluster on chromosome 23 (B).
The arrows indicate the direction of transcription. CCEs are shown as
purple arrows, while other genes are indicated with black arrows.

(data not shown); however, our microsynteny analysis
supported the interpretation of Nlg-1 homology (see
below).
The chromosomal locations of B. mori neuroligins
showed unique features compared to other insects (Figure 6B). In A. mellifera, A. gambiae and D. melanogaster,
all neuroligins except for Nlg-2 are located on the same
chromosome [2]. By contrast, B. mori Nlg-3 and Nlg-4

Page 9 of 11

are located on a chromosome different from the one Nlg5 is located; Nlg-3 and two Nlg-4 genes are on chromosome 15, while Nlg-5 is on chromosome 4 (Figures. 4 and
6B). Moreover, Nlg-2, which is singly located on a chromosome in D. melanogaster, A. gambiae and A. mellifera,
is on the same chromosome as Nlg-5 in B. mori (Figure
6B). BGIBMGA002170 is located between Nlg-3 and two
Nlg-4 genes (data not shown). In D. melanogaster, A.
gambiae and A. mellifera Nlg-1 is located between Nlg-3
and Nlg-4 [2], supporting for the interpretation that
BGIBMGA002170 is an Nlg-1 homologue. In light of
these results, we propose that the following events have
occurred in the evolution of the Lepidoptera: (1) duplication of the Nlg-4 gene, (2) separation of the chromosomal
segments containing Nlg-3~5, and (3) fusion of the chromosomal segments containing Nlg-2 and Nlg-5. More
genomic information will be necessary to verify this
hypothesis. We also compared the intron positions
between neuroligins of B. mori, D. melanogaster and A.
mellifera, and found that most intron positions, including
the common intron in CCEs of clades 024-026 (Figure 2,
green brackets), were conserved.

Conclusions
We analyzed the genomic distribution, phylogeny and
EST expression of 69 B. mori CCEs. Many B. mori CCEs
were expressed in the midgut, and such midgut expression was conserved with CCEs of other lepidopteran
insects located in the same phylogenetic tree. The abundance of CCEs of the silkworm (or Lepidoptera), compared to species of other insect orders, is a possible
consequence of the high number of these midgut CCEs.
Intron positions and splice site phases were strongly conserved among B. mori CCEs, and they were located
unevenly in the genome. Among the CCEs of B. mori,
neuroligins show evidence of having evolved uniquely
compared to other insects. Our genomic analysis has provided novel information on the CCEs of the silkworm,
which will be of value to understanding the biology, physiology and evolution of insect CCEs.

Database analysis

Figure 6 Phylogenetic and microsynteny analysis of neuroligin
genes. (A) The phylogenetic tree of B. mori, D. melanogaster, A. aegypti
and A. mellifera neuroligins. Asterisks in the cladogram indicate bootstrap values greater than 50%. For the neuroligins except B. mori, refer
to Claudianos et al [2]. Neuroligins of B. mori are colored light blue, D.
melanogaster are colored green, A. gambiae are colored brown and A.
mellifera are colored orange. (B) The chromosomal locations of B. mori
neuroligins. The direction of the arrow indicates the transcription direction. The color of each neuroligin arrow is the same as that for orthologs in Claudianos et al [2].

CCE sequences were retrieved from NCBI [36]. EST
clones of B. mori CCEs were searched using tBLASTN in
NCBI [36], KAIKObase [37], SilkBase [38] and a private
library. Introns were identified by comparison of amino
acid sequences with DNA sequences, and the canonical
GT/AG rule was used to specify the exon-intron junction
position [39]. The chromosomal locations of the genes
were determined from KAIKObase [37].

Phylogenetic analysis of CCE

ClustalW software was used to perform a multiple
sequence alignment prior to the phylogenetic analysis.
MEGA 4.0 [40] was used to construct the phylogenetic
tree using the Minimum Evolution method with the JTT
matrix. To evaluate branch strength in the phylogenetic
tree, a bootstrap analysis of 500 replicates was performed.
