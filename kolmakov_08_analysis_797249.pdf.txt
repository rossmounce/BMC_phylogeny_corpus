Abstract
Background: The goldfish (Carassius auratus) uses steroids and prostaglandins as pheromone cues
at different stages of the reproductive cycle to facilitate spawning synchronization. Steroid
progestin pheromone binding has been detected in goldfish olfactory membranes but the receptors
responsible for this specific binding remain unknown. In order to shed some light on the olfactory
epithelium transcriptome and search for possible receptor candidates a large set of EST from this
tissue were analysed and compared to and combined with a similar zebrafish (Danio rerio) resource.
Results: We generated 4,797 high quality sequences from a normalized cDNA library of the
goldfish olfactory epithelium, which were clustered in 3,879 unique sequences, grouped in 668
contigs and 3,211 singletons. BLASTX searches produced 3,243 significant (E-value < e-10) hits and
Gene Ontology (GO) analysis annotated a further 1,223 of these genes (37.7%). Comparative
analysis with zebrafish olfactory epithelium ESTs revealed 1,088 identical unigenes. The
transcriptome size of both species was estimated at about 16,400 unigenes, based on the
proportion of genes identified involved in Glucose Metabolic Process. Of 124 G-protein coupled
receptors identified in the olfactory epithelium of both species, 56 were olfactory receptors. Beta
and gamma membrane progestin receptors were also isolated by subcloning of RT-PCR products
from both species and an olfactory epithelium specific splice form identified.
Conclusion: The high similarity between the goldfish and zebrafish olfactory systems allowed the
creation of a 'cyprinid' olfactory epithelium library estimated to represent circa 70% of the
transcriptome. These results are an important resource for the identification of components of
signalling pathways involved in olfaction as well as putative targets for pharmacological and
histochemical studies. The possible function of the receptors identified in the olfactory system is
described. Moreover, the role of olfactory epithelium specific isoforms of classical membrane
progestin receptor genes as candidates for preovulatory pheromone sensing is discussed.

Background
Chemical senses play an important role in aquatic organisms, affecting many aspects of their biology. In teleost
fish, social behaviour, reproduction, homing, schooling,
search for food and predator avoidance are all regulated
by the sense of smell [1-3]. In addition, because of its origin and structure, the olfactory epithelium is the first tissue to be affected by any toxic agent that fish encounter in
the natural environment [4,5] and heavy metal accumulation in the fish brain directly affects signal transduction in
the central nervous system [6]. However, despite the existence of many physiological and behavioral studies about
olfaction in fish, the molecular mechanisms of signal
transduction and regulation of olfaction is not fully
understood.
It has been proposed that olfactory receptor proteins
responsible for odorant recognition belong to the large
superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR)[7].
Genome-wide analysis of several fish species has provided
some data about the number and variability of GPCRs in
fish. Indeed, genomic studies of zebrafish (Danio rerio),
tiger puffer fish (Takifugu rubripes) and medaka (Orizias
latipes) have led to the identification of three main receptor classes possibly involved in olfaction and pheromone
communication. These are the principal olfactory receptors (Class A – rhodopsin-like), vomeronasal-type 2 (VT2;
Class C – Ca sensing and metabotropic glutamate receptors) as well as a recently described vomeronasal-type 1
homolog class (closely related to Class A) which contains
few members [8,9]. The zebrafish genome contains
approximately 140 hypothetical Class A receptors, while
in puffer fishes there are 44 and approximately 50 Class C
receptors [8,9]. Relatively few of the receptors have been
isolated as cDNA and some are expressed in tissues other
than the olfactory epithelia, raising questions about their
exclusive role in olfaction.
Despite the importance of the goldfish (Carassius auratus)
for behavioural studies and its well characterised pheromonal system [10], only 22 receptors have been cloned so
far, 4 from class A and 18 from class C [11-13]. Moreover,
for only a single olfactory receptor, OR5.24, has ligand
preference been characterised and shown to bind positively charged, amino acids [12]. However, a wide group
of chemicals are known to induce a physiological
response in the goldfish. Such chemicals include, amino
acids and polyamines [14], which are the main signal for
recognition of food and danger; bile acids which are
involved in social behaviour between conspecifics or
related species [15]; steroids, mainly the progestins
17,20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20β-P), 17,20β-P
sulphate and androstenedione, which synchronize
gonadal maturation among sexes [16,17], and prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α), which elicits spawning behaviour [18]. It

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/429

has been shown that steroid- and prostaglandin responses
are at least partly mediated by the cyclic AMP signalling
pathway [19] and that olfactory epithelium cells have steroid-binding activity [20].
The objective of the present study was to obtain insight
into molecular mechanisms of olfactory and in particular
pheromone signaling by analysing expressed sequence
tags (ESTs) of the goldfish olfactory epithelium. Identification of candidate genes potentially involved in the regulation and structural organization of olfactory signaling
pathways in fish should contribute to extend knowledge
of receptors and auxiliary proteins underpinning olfaction. To this end an EST collection produced from a normalized cDNA library of the olfactory epithelium from
sexually mature goldfish was analysed. Comparison of
olfactory epithelium ESTs from goldfish and zebrafish,
both cyprinids, allowed an estimation of transcriptome
size in the goldfish olfactory epithelium to be made. The
presence of splice variants of membrane progestin receptors (PAQR) are reported for the first time in olfactory epithelium together with genes involved in their regulation.
A number of new olfactory and other G-protein coupled
receptors have been identified as well as a group of Class
A subfamily receptors, closely related to Xenopus amino
acid olfactory receptors.

Results and Discussion
Descriptive statistics of Expressed Sequence Tags
A total of 6,144 EST were produced from a normalized
goldfish olfactory epithelium cDNA library. After subtraction of poor quality sequences, the average length per EST
of the remaining sequences (4,797) was 608 base pairs.
The sequences were assembled into 668 contigs and 3,211
singletons (Table 1) [see Additional file 1]. Because further assembling was not possible, the sequences obtained
were considered unigenes, each unigene representing the
product of a separate gene. Unigenes corresponded to
about four-fifths of the total sequences obtained (Table
1). Most of the genes identified were isolated for the first
time in this species, highlighting the paucity of gene
expression studies in the species. Normalization was
highly efficient as demonstrated by a low skewness (4.56)
and kurtosis (37.6). Contigs were composed of multiple

ESTs with a maximal depth of 11. Only 9 contigs had a
depth of more than 5 and the upper 25 percentile contained only 41.4% of all ESTs. By comparison, zebrafish
ESTs pooled from two non-normalized olfactory epithelium libraries comprised 6,696 unigenes from 34,699
counts. Pooling of the two zebrafish olfactory epithelium
libraries did not significantly change redundancy – skewness of the pooled zebrafish EST libraries was 13.76 versus
13.91 for the average of the two separate libraries, and
kurtosis was 233.3 versus 245.4. Maximal contig depth in
the pooled libraries was 512 EST counts and the upper
25th percentile contained 80.1% of total EST counts. The
percentage of goldfish unigene sequences which had a statistically significant similarity to genes deposited in GenBank was 83.6%, compared to 92.6% for the pooled
zebrafish olfactory epithelium unigenes.
Comparison between Goldfish and Zebrafish olfactory
epithelium ESTs
The similarity of the goldfish and zebrafish olfactory epithelium EST collections was examined using side-by-side
comparison of the total list of identified genes. Unidentified goldfish unigenes were further compared to the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/429

pooled zebrafish EST olfactory library using BLASTn with
an E-value < e-40. From the preceding analysis, a total of
1,088 common unigenes were obtained, of which 44
lacked annotation to known gene products. The goldfish
unigenes were evenly represented throughout the frequency distribution range of unigenes in the zebrafish
non-normalized library, suggesting representation bias
was minimal or absent in the goldfish library (Figure 1).
To further substantiate the observed lack of representation
bias in the normalized goldfish olfactory epithelium
library, one thousand clones were randomly picked and
sequenced from a non-normalized, goldfish olfactory epithelium library (not described) and yielded 253 unigenes.
Comparative analysis of the 253 unigenes with the goldfish normalized library and zebrafish pooled library
revealed 66 and 131 matches, respectively and 104 unigenes which were absent from both libraries. The ratio of
goldfish/zebrafish matches in the latter analysis was
50.4%, similar to the results obtained for the normalized
goldfish library, further supporting the notion of a lack of
amplification bias during the normalization process.

The close phylogenetic relationship between goldfish and
zebrafish and the almost identical size of estimated transcriptome of their respective olfactory epithelia led us to
combine the ESTs from the two species into a "cyprinid"
olfactory epithelium transcriptome. In order to do this
identical unigenes were treated as the same, while closely
related genes (same gene subfamily, subunits of the same
protein complex, etc.) were listed separately. Any information about levels of expression was removed, thus the
list contains information only about presence of genes in
the olfactory epithelium. As a result, 9,596 unique
sequence identifiers were assembled, which comprised
58.5% of the estimated cyprinid olfactory epithelium
transcriptome. This percentage is what would be predicted
based on the unigenes obtained from the non normalized
goldfish olfactory epithelium, in which clones absent
from goldfish and zebrafish libraries comprised 41.1%
(compared to expected random picking of 41.5%). As a
result we estimate that the "cyprinid" olfactory epithelium
transcriptome is approximately 16,400 unigenes.

Transcriptome estimation
In order to obtain an estimate of the goldfish olfactory
epithelium transcriptome size, a list of 75 genes associated with Glucose Metabolic Process in animals was
extracted from the Gene Ontology (Table 2). Of these
genes, 15 (20%) were present in the normalized goldfish
olfactory epithelium EST collection and 28 (37.3%) were
found in the pooled zebrafish olfactory epithelium
library. Extrapolation of the proportion of Glucose Metabolic Process genes in these libraries to the total number
of unigenes for each library gave an estimate of the olfactory epithelium transcriptome size of, respectively, 16215
and 16612 unigenes for goldfish and zebrafish. The ratio
of Glucose Metabolic Process genes present in the goldfish
and zebrafish EST libraries (53.6%) was similar to the
ratio of the number of unigenes present in the two libraries (52.3%). This is in agreement with the hypothesis that
the transcriptome of this tissue in the two species is of a
similar size.

Taken together these data support the use of the
"cyprinid" unigene set in further analysis of olfactory epithelium gene expression.
General description of genes in the transcriptome
Since normalization of the goldfish olfactory epithelium
library was highly efficient, it is not possible to use it to
determine the level of expression of the most abundant
mRNA species using ESTs counts. For this purpose the list
of unigenes from the pooled zebrafish library was used.
The unigenes with a redundancy level higher than 0.5%
are listed in Table 3.

The 20 most expressed genes in the olfactory epithelium
of adult zebrafish could be divided into four groups: 1)
immune response, 2) cell machinery and cytoskeleton, 3)
tissue specific function and 4) unidentified. Immune
response genes were represented by 4 genes from both
MHCI (invariant chain-like protein 1 and 2, HLA-B associated transcript 5) and MHCII (beta-2-microglobulin)
[21]. Cell machinery genes included those encoding 3
ribosomal proteins, mitochondrial carrier slc25a4, betaactin, tubulin, tubulin-related tctp (tpt1) and iron-sequestering ferritin [22-24]. Also in this group elongation factor
1-alpha, related to protein synthesis in general, was most
abundant. Among genes generally highly expressed in epithelial or neuronal tissue and expected to have a high level
of expression in olfactory epithelium, were apolipoprotein E, tyrosinase-related protein 1 and G-protein beta

subunit homologue RACK1. Apolipoprotein E plays an
important role in lipid transport and lipoprotein metabolism, both processes involved in the formation of the
olfactory epithelium mucosa [25]. The gene for tyrosinase-related protein 1 is involved in pigmentation and
melanin synthesis [26]. GNB2L1(RACK1) is a key element
of cell migration and adhesion through integrins and IGF
and is highly expressed in epithelial cells and fibroblasts
[27]. Twelve of the most abundant zebrafish transcripts
were also identified in goldfish olfactory epithelium,
including the four of immune response genes, apolipoprotein E and G-protein beta subunit homologue. A
recent analysis of a small set of channel catfish (Ictalurus
puntactus) olfactory epithelium ESTs reported by Li et al.
[28] also described the presence of immune system genes,
including invariant chain-like proteins, cytokines and
lymphocyte markers, and some other non-neuronal elements also identified in goldfish and zebrafish by our
analysis. The expression of these genes in independently
produced cDNA libraries of the olfactory system of the
three species suggests it is not due to possible contamination with other tissues and corresponds to the expectation
of a well developed specific immune barrier, necessary to
protect the unique neuronal tract, which directly links the
brain with environment.
The unigenes of the goldfish olfactory epithelium library
with identity to known gene products were assigned to
Gene Ontology (GO) categories using data from Gene

Ontology and GeneCards databases. A total of 1,464 unigenes was successfully assigned to 10,335 GO categories.
Within the Molecular Function category, most of the identified proteins were involved in binding (45.7%), catalytic
activity (28.7%), transporter (5.6%), and signal transducer activity (6.9%). In terms of physiological processes,
the most represented unigenes correspond to cellular
process (29.8%), metabolism (20.9%), and biological
regulation (11.7%) (Figure 2). When comparing with
gene ontology categories of channel catfish gill epithelium [28] some specificities become evident. For example,
the representation of both transcription regulatory mechanisms and DNA binding proteins in gill is proportionally
twice that of the olfactory epithelium possibly because of
a higher diversity of cell types (e.g., cartilage, bone, different types of epithelial cells) in gills. In contrast, at the
translational level the olfactory epithelium has a higher
proportion of regulatory elements and protein binding
representatives. Also, within the binding category in olfactory epithelium there were some elements, absent from
gill, possibly related to the tissues sensory function, such
as over-represented genes involved in nucleotide (mainly
cAMP) and ion (Ca2+, Na+ and Cl-) binding. Furthermore,
comparison of Biological Processes revealed a higher proportion of genes involved in growth, development and
apoptotic mechanisms in the olfactory epithelium possibly reflecting intensive recirculation of the neurons.
GPCR receptor repertoire in the olfactory epithelium
Class I GPCRs – Rhodopsin family
Several dozen G-protein coupled receptors were identified
in the fish olfactory epithelium tissue as one or more EST
copies, the majority belonged to Class I or the Rhodopsin
family. This class could be further subdivided into three
major subgroups: 1) immune system related receptors, 2)
receptors to purines, pirimidines, and hormones, as well
as neuromediator-related receptors and 3) olfactory receptors and orphan GPCRs.
GPCRs related to the immune system
This subgroup (Table 4) includes GPCRs containing the
C-C motif chemokine receptors 5 and 6 (ccr*), C-X-C
motif receptors 3.2, 4, 5 and 7 (cxcr*), leucotiene B4
receptor 2 (ltb4r2), GPRs 34b, 63 and 132. The EpsteinBarr-virus-induced G-protein coupled receptor 2 (ebi2) is
also part of this subgroup. CCR5 is expressed in lymphoid
organs such as thymus and spleen, as well as in peripheral
blood leukocytes, including macrophages and T cells, and
stimulates leukocyte chemotactic activity through generation of inositol phosphates in the presence of macrophage
inflammatory protein 1 [29]. CCR6 expression is
restricted to functionally mature memory B cells, capable
of responding to antigen challenge [30]. Splice variant 2
of CXCR3 has been shown to play a key role in transduction of the angiostatic effect of cytokines in microvascular

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/429

endothelial cells [31]. Chemokine receptor 4 (cxcr4)
affects cell-cycle proteins in hippocampal or cerebellar
granule neurons and through cytokine binding represses
the activity of E2F-dependent apoptotic genes to maintain
neurons in a highly differentiated and quiescent state
[32]. The ligand CXCL12 is a main axon guidance agent in
the zebrafish olfactory system [33]. CXCR7 is a co-receptor for CXCR4 in B-, T-cells and monocytes [34]. CXCR5
is a cytokine receptor involved in B-cell activation and
chemoattraction [35]. GPR132 is predominantly
expressed in lymphocytes and macrophages where it
serves as a mitosis delay mechanism under control of lysophosphatidylcholine and endogenous lysophosphatidic
acid DNA damage signals [36]. GPR34 is the receptor for
lysophosphatidylserine in mast cells. It is reported to be
expressed in brain and adipose tissue and is involved in
wound healing [37]. Endothelial differentiation G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Edg5) is a receptor for sphingosine 1-phosphate, which is responsible for neurite
retraction and also keratinocyte growth arrest and differentiation during wound healing [38]. G protein-coupled
receptor 63 (GPR63) is homologous to Xenopus PSP24β
[39] which is expressed mainly in neuronal cells, such as
olfactory mitral cells, cortical neurons, hippocampus
pyramidal cells, and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Preliminary studies proposed sphingosine-1-phosphate as
the ligand and G-protein αq (Gαq) as an effector for this
receptor [40]. Leukotriene B(4) receptor 2 is expressed in
mononuclear lymphocytes and provokes chemotaxis in a
pertussis toxin-sensitive manner, relating its action to activation of the Gαi pathway [41]. GPR81 is an orphan
receptor, similar to neurotensin receptor, which is exclusively expressed in T-cells [42]. EBV-induced G-protein
coupled receptor 2(ebi2) is most closely related to the
thrombin receptor. It is expressed in B-lymphocyte cell
lines, lymphoid tissues and is also expressed at lower levels in a promyelocytic (glial precursor) cell line [43].
Expression of such a comprehensive immune repertoire is
puzzling as immune cells are generally of low abundance
in the olfactory epithelium and have been reported in the
basal layer of epithelium, as shown in Labeo rohita [44].
One possible explanation could be that cytokines, in addition to their role as mediators of the immune response are
also involved in nervous system development and neuronal differentiation [45]. Moreover, as significant proliferation of neurons takes place in the olfactory system
elements of the immune system may be part of a selective
internal mechanisms of sensory cell population regulation via apoptotic mechanisms [46]. An insight into the
possible role for different types of immune cells, as well as
astroglia, in this process may be derived from multiple
sclerosis models, where de-myelination and neuronal
degradation mechanisms have been shown [47].

GPCRs for purines, pirimidines, hormones and neuromediators
This subgroup includes P2Y5, 6, 7, 10; 5-HT (serotonin)
receptor F1, beta-3b-adrenergic receptor, prostaglandin
E2 receptor EP4 (ptger4), gastrin-releasing peptide
(bombesin) receptor and histamine receptor H2.

A ligand for purinergic receptor 5 (p2ry5) still has to be
identified [48]. Pyrimidinergic receptor P2Y6 (p2ry6) is
expressed in human nasal epithelial cells and activates the
IP3 signaling pathway in the presence of UDP, and regulates mucin and fluid secretion [49]. P2RY7 is a leukotriene B(4) receptor, regulated by GRK6 and is responsible
for extracellular ATP-dependent regulation of L-type Ca2+
channels. P2Y10 has so far not been identified as a nucleotide activated receptor, but has been shown to be
involved in monocyte development [48]. While the exact
cell type, expressing nucleotide receptors in fish is still
unknown, there is the possibility that they can be
involved in olfactory response modulation in response to
noxious odorants, as shown in mice [50]. They could also
be immediate olfactory receptors, since the fish olfactory
epithelium is able to sense several nucleotides [51].
5-HT1F is a sumatriptan-sensitive serotonin receptor
shown to be preferentially expressed in trigeminal ganglia
and brain blood vessels where it plays role in regulation
of migraine development [52]. It is also a potent inhibitor
of olfactory responses in goldfish (Kolmakov et al, personal observation). The recently discovered trace amineassociated receptors (TAAR) [53] are also expressed in the
cyprinid olfactory epithelium, with only one homologue
each of TAAR9 and TAAR3 identified in goldfish. At least
24 TAAR ESTs have been identified in zebrafish olfactory
epithelium [54], although 57 intact genes have been
reported to be present in the genome [55]. Based on the
17 TAAR transcripts present in our "cyprinid" olfactory
library we suggest approximately 40–45 TAAR genes are

expressed in the olfactory epithelium of cyprinids.
Although a role for TAAR receptors in mammalian olfaction of pheromonal volatile amines has been reported,
there is still no direct evidence for a role in fish olfaction
[54]. However, the expression of TAAR homologues in sea
lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) olfactory epithelium is supportive of the notion that TAARs are an ancient group of
olfactory receptors [56]. Perhaps their close phylogenetic
relationship to biogenic amine receptors may indicate
that in fish they serve, together with 5-HT1F, as receptors
for catecholamines, potent odorants in goldfish [57].
Another possibility could be a role as part of a regulatory
signal transduction mechanism with ligands like lysophosphatidic acid and sphingosine, similar to a group of
the phylogenetically closely related endothelial differentiation G-protein coupled receptors (EDGs), also expressed
in the olfactory epithelium.
The prostaglandin E2 receptor EP4 (ptger4) is an effector of
PGE2 inhibition of bone-resorbing activity in functionally
mature osteoclasts [58]. It also stimulates the immune
response in B-cells and monocytes [59]. An EST was isolated sharing similarity only to the second translated exon
of ptger4, while the N-terminus did not give any match to
the zebrafish genome or any other database. Taking into
account that in most prostaglandin receptors the first
translated exon encodes 6 of the 7 transmembrane helices, including the putative ligand-binding pocket [60],
and that they share a high level of sequence similarity in
the second translated exon, this new cDNA could be a new
receptor, probably still from the tromboxane/prostaglandin family. It will be of interest in the future to determine
if it is a candidate receptor for PGF2α the postovulatory
pheromone in goldfish.
The beta-3b-adrenergic receptor, together with the beta-2adrenoreceptor are able to form heterodimers with other

GPCRs of class A, altering their ligand specificity, signaling pathway and internalization [61,62]. In mice, the
beta-2-adrenoreceptor co-expresses with olfactory receptors and is necessary for their successful translocation to
the cell surface [63]. Finally, the bombesin receptor is
involved in synaptic plasticity regulation in brain, as well
as regulation of a broad spectra of behaviors including
feeding and social interaction [64] while the histamine
receptor is shown to be important for activation of astrocytes in neonatal rat brain [65].
Olfactory receptors and orphan GPCRs
This subgroup includes GPR108 and its homologue
TMEM87B both members of the LUSTR family of proteins
containing a carboxy-terminal seven transmembrane
domain. They are expressed in fungiform papillae in
humans and are suggested to be taste receptors [66].
Orphan GPR137 shares identity with a prostate-specific
odorant-like GPCR-encoding gene (PSGR) and was
detected mainly in hippocampus [67]. Orphan GPR161 is
expressed in rat brain and olfactory epithelium and at a
lower level in liver [68]. GPR173 is member 3 of the so
called "Super Conserved Receptor Expressed in Brain"
SREB family, which is highly conserved amongst vertebrates. SREB3 member is predominantly expressed in the
brain, mainly cerebellum, and ovaries, but not in testis,
and remains an orphan receptor [69].

Twelve putative ORs were identified in the goldfish olfactory epithelium EST collection. Based upon the classification of Alioto and Ngai [8], the receptors were assigned to
several families: family A members 112-1 and 113-1; family C member 102-1; family D members 107-1, 110-1,
111-10; family E members 125-1, 127-1, 128-5 and three
of family F member 115-1 homologues. The average similarity to zebrafish OR was higher than 80% for all the
identified goldfish cDNA. Based on the predicted transcriptome size, it seems probable that 45–50 rhodopsinlike olfactory receptors are expressed in the goldfish olfactory epithelium. OR107-1 is a zebrafish homologue of the
previously cloned goldfish receptor GFA2 [11]. Other
goldfish olfactory receptors also present in the EST have
previously been isolated in families C (GFA12, GFA25,
CaOR45) and E (GFA28) [11]. Family C is closely related
to long-chain non polar aminoacid olfactory receptors of
Xenopus tropicalis, XB107, 238, 239 and 242 [70]. Two of
the members of this family share the same correlated
mutational analysis patterns, a strong reason to suspect
similarity of ligands [71] making family members good
candidate olfactory receptors for methionine, valine, leucine and cysteine.
Additional olfactory receptors were identified by RT-PCR,
including receptors from families C, D, E and F and a
homologue of the single member of family B (101-1). The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/429

total number of confirmed OR genes expressed in the
goldfish olfactory epithelium when the results of RT-PCR
are taken together with the EST analysis is 41, which
closely matches the predicted number of ORs. Surprisingly, neither the goldfish EST annotation, nor RT-PCR
were able to identify members of the proposed families G
and H, while in the zebrafish olfactory epithelium only a
single receptor from family G and 6 receptors from family
H have been identified. Also and searches through pufferfish, stickleback and medaka genomes failed to find any
family G member which until appears to be restricted only
to the zebrafish genome [8]. This may reflect selective
adaptation of the zebrafish olfactory system to environmental conditions related to a species specific duplication
even and is supported by the fact that the largest cluster of
TAAR genes [72] is located less than 2 megabases away on
the same chromosome and those genes are also specific
for zebrafish.
Class II GPCRs – Secretin family
A number of transcripts belonging to the second class of
GPCRs (Secretin/VIP family) were identified and include,
calcitonin receptor-like receptor (calcrl), cadherin EGF
LAG receptor 1b (flamingo), GPR64 and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP) type I receptor
(adcyap1r1). Calcitonin receptor-like receptor has been
shown to be co-expressed with RAMP1 in cortex, caudate
putamen and olfactory tubercles, providing selective specificity to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and regulation of endothelial cell proliferation [73]. Flamingo is a
key receptor regulating dendritic net development in the
retina and is also involved in axon guidance [74]. GPR64
is an orphan receptor, extensively expressed in epididymis, where it regulates fluid resorption from the ducts
and when knocked-out in mice causes male infertility
[75]. PACAP type 1 receptor is mainly expressed in the
hypothalamus, where it regulates the release of a number
of different hormones, including luteinizing hormone,
growth hormone and prolactin, and stimulates proliferation of neuronal stem cells upon PACAP activation in
mouse [76].
Class III GPCRs – γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) B/metabotropic
glutamate (mGluR) family
The third class of GPCRs identified in olfactory epithelium, GABA (B) and mGluR receptor family includes Casensing receptor, taste receptors of the T1R family and
putative pheromone V2R family [9]. The goldfish olfactory library contained ESTs encoding GABA(B) receptor 1
and putative pheromone receptors Cppr10, 11 and GFB 9
and 14. The zebrafish collection contained additionally
two homologues of cppr10, cppr1, V2R2 (GFB8), two
homologues of GFB7, OR5.24 (gprc6a) and orphan gprc5c.
In the rat olfactory bulb GABA-B receptors couple to Gαi/
o and stimulate an increase of cAMP via βγ-mediated acti-

vation of adenylate cyclase 2, while simultaneously inhibiting Gαs-mediated activation of other adenylate cyclases
[77].
The function of the two metabotropic glutamate receptor
ESTs (mGlur1 and mGlur3) isolated is unclear but electrophysiological studies in the channel catfish indicated that
they are directly involved in olfaction of glutamate [78].
Cpprs are putative pheromone receptors of unrevealed
cyprinid species from the NCBI database. GFBs were isolated from goldfish, with numbers 9 and 14 represented
by full-length cDNA sequences and the rest by partial protein fragments [11]. Odorant receptor 5.24 was first found
in goldfish and is the only deorfanized receptor of this
family with broad selectivity for positively charged amino
acids. Mutagenesis studies of OR5.24 revealed inversion
from positive to negative charge selectivity by some point
mutations [79], the resulting modified sequence is
present in related receptors suggesting they are candidate
ORs for charged amino acid olfaction. GPRC5C is an
orfan receptor from the mGluR family, which has been
shown to be expressed under all-trans retinoic acid induction in peripheral tissues, although its function remains to
be established [80].
Progestin receptors in the olfactory epithelium
As previously stated, goldfish and other cyprinids are able
to smell progestin steroids, namely17,20β-P and its sulphate and glucuronide conjugates which act as pre-ovulatory pheromones [81]. Physiological cross-adaptation
studies of the olfactory epithelium suggest that there are at
least two distinctive receptors, one shared by 17,20β-P
and its glucuronide and the other for the sulphate [81].
Specific binding for 17,20β-P has been found in olfactory
epithelium membrane preparations using radio-receptor
assays. [20]. In addition, pharmacological studies suggest
that progestin signal transduction in the olfactory system
acts via activation of the Gαi (pertussis toxin sensitive) proteins and consequent reduction of cAMP levels [19]. Overall, this physiological evidence is consistent with
progestin pheromone receptors belonging to the GPCR
family.

Possible candidates for progestin pheromone receptors
are among the group of membrane progestin receptors
(mPRs), which were first isolated from spotted seatrout
(Cynoscion nebulosus) oocyte membranes [82] and, more
recently, in other fish species, such as the zebrafish (Danio
rerio), catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), medaka (Oryzias latipes)
and goldfish (Carassius auratus) [83,84]. Homologous
genes are also expressed in higher vertebrates, from frogs
(Xenopus tropicalis) to rodents and humans [85]. These
genes were identified as members of the progestin and
AdipoQ receptor family (PAQR), an ancient group of
GPCRs which has evolved from Eubacteria independent

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/429

of other seven transmembrane domain receptors [86].
Three members of the PAQR family can bind progestins;
PAQR7 (mPRα), PAQR8 (mPRβ) and PAQR5 (mPRγ)
[85]. As a result of fish specific duplication events, paralogous pairs of all three receptors have arisen. While, both
mPRα and β are products from intronless genes, mPRγ is
the product of a gene containing eight exons. Furthermore, each gene has distinctive tissue distribution patterns. While mPRα and mPRβ are mainly gonad and brain
specific, mPRγ is expressed at higher levels in excretory tissues such as the intestine, colon, kidney and gills [83].
Functionally, they also play distinct roles. For example,
mPRβ in ovaries is involved in vitellogenesis but not in
final oocyte maturation, as its mRNA expression is unaffected by hormonal stimulation and sharply decreases at
late vitellogenesis [87]. In the nervous system, mPRβ
expression is related to its role in mediating the stimulatory effects of progesterone in myelin sheath formation
and initiation of neuro-protective gene expression
[88,89]. In cell lines, mPRβ has been shown to activate the
MAP kinase signaling pathway and thereby to regulate
gene expression but it has no apparent effect on Gαi-mediated pathways [84].
The main functions of mPRα in fish are related to reproduction; more specifically, to final oocyte or spermatozoa
maturation. In goldfish and seatrout, its expression
reaches a peak just prior to final maturation of the
oocytes. This peak is necessary for maturation competence
under gonadotrophin treatment mediated by the related
progestins 17,20β-P and 17,20β,21-trihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one, respectively [90]. The latter progestin also acts
via mPRα to stimulate sperm motility in the Atlantic
croaker Micropogonias undulatus [91]. In the zebrafish, activation of mPRα inhibits adenylate cyclase activity, in a
pertussis toxin sensitive manner, implying involvement of
Gαi. The functions of mPRγ are still unclear, but it has
been shown to bind progesterone and its hydroxylated
derivatives in humans [85].
Genebank contains a number of cDNA for the mPR family
and four gene products have been isolated from goldfish
ovaries: mPRα (accession number AB122087.1), mPRβ
(AB284131.1), mPRγ-2 (AB284133.1) and mPRγ-1
(AB284132.1). Zebrafish mPRα (AY149121.1) and mPRβ
(AY149120.1) were reported by Zhu et al. [85] while two
orthologues of mPRγ-1, PAQR5a (BC045864.1) and
PAQR5b (BC078202.1), are part of the National Institutes
of Health Mammalian Gene Collection [92]. mPRγ-2 is a
fish orthologue of mammalian PAQR6 and zebrafish
'LOC570587' (NW_001877690.1) was predicted from
the genomic sequence.
In the present study several mPR receptors were identified
in goldfish and zebrafish olfactory epithelia. In the

zebrafish, a single EST for mPRβ and 11 ESTs encoding
PAQR5b were identified. In contrast, the goldfish EST
library did not contain any of these genes. However, other
PAQR family members were identified; adiponectin
receptors 1b (adipor1) and 2 (adipor2) which are involved
in lipid metabolism and PAQR3 (Raf kinase inhibitor)
which prevents tumorogenesis [93]. RT-PCR studies with
zebrafish olfactory epithelium and mPR specific primers
revealed two splice variants of PAQR5b. In goldfish olfactory epithelium three different amplicons were obtained,
a mPRγ-1 and two splice variants of mPRγ-2. The presence
of mPRβ was also confirmed by RT-PCR in the olfactory
epithelium of both species, but it was not possible to
amplify mPRα.
Further analysis of these mPRγ transcripts revealed some
interesting properties of one of the splice forms. Between
the two paralogous genes, PAQR5a and PAQR5b, the latter is the closest orthologue to the goldfish mPRγ-1, with
sequence similarity at both DNA and amino acid
sequence levels of about 84% (Figure 3A). The PAQR5b
gene product, isolated from the ovaries, is a transcript of
the complete set of eight exons. One of the PCR products
from the zebrafish olfactory epithelium represented
exactly the same splice variant. Another PAQR5b PCR
product and all 11 EST sequences from the zebrafish
cDNA library are the result of alternative splicing, where
exon number 5, a 15 amino acid fragment, is absent. The
mPRγ-1, reported earlier in ovaries and isolated in the current study from goldfish olfactory epithelium, lacks the
same fragment (Figure 3B). ESTs of mPRγ-1 paralogue,
containing exon 5, from other fish species are also available in GenBank: the phylogenetically distant stickleback
(Gasterosteus aculeatus; e.g. DN666595), as well as other
cyprinids such as the roach (Rutilus rutilus; EG532701)
and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas; DT191559).
However, it was not possible to establish if the lack of
exon 5 is a splice variant in goldfish or if this exon has
been lost during evolution in this species.
Two other PCR products from goldfish were splice variants of mPRγ-2. Whilst overall homology between protein
sequence of mPRγ-2 and PAQR5b was only 55%, the
amino acids on the borders of exons are well conserved
and the gene organization of PAQR6 and PAQR5 is identical. This allowed alignment of PCR products against
PAQR5b to establish exon composition and distinguish
between splice variants and identify missing exons (Figure
3B). One of the PCR products amplified was identical to
previously described mPRγ-2 from ovaries. This transcript
resembles mPRγ-1 in that it also lacks exon 5. A novel
splice variant was identified which lacks the relatively
short exon 5 and the longer (33 amino acids) exon 6 (Figure 3B). Using a combination of SOSUI [94] and TMpred
[95], the putative trans-membrane domain combinations

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/429

for PAQR5b, mPRγ-2 (lacking exon 5) and mPRγ-2b (lacking exons 5 and 6) (Figure 4) was predicted. This analysis
revealed that exon 5 encodes part of the second extra-cellular loop and its loss does not radically change the configuration of the trans-membrane domains. However, in
the splice variant missing both exon 5 and 6, complete rearrangement of trans-membrane domains 5 and 6, as well
as the third extra-cellular loop may occur (Figure 4C). We
predict that the initial domain number 6 becomes
inverted taking the place of the absent domain number 5
and that part of the long third extra-cellular loop, containing a low-score alpha helix, becomes the new domain 6,
preserving the stable seven trans-membrane architecture.
Nevertheless, it is likely that such a drastic change in extracellular and trans-membrane architecture changes the ligand-binding properties and, possibly, the transduction
pathway.
Screening of the NCBI EST database for the identified
splice variants revealed a complete form of PAQR5b is
expressed in the intestine, trunk kidney, colon, gills and
gonads of fish. Single EST copies for the mPRγ-1-like
splice variant were present in head kidney, skin and fins
but the majority were located in zebrafish olfactory epithelium. mPRγ-2 was found only at low levels in the brain
of zebrafish and the fathead minnow. However, in an
ancient vertebrate, the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus),
a single EST (EE741072.1) was identified for this receptor
in the olfactory epithelium. In mammals, this receptor is
expressed only in brain areas which have connections to
the accessory olfactory bulb, suggesting a role in pheromonal signal processing. No sequence which lacked both
exons 5 and 6 was identified in any sequence database
and none of these genes were found in the mammalian
olfactory system or in frog olfactory bulb.
Taken together, these results demonstrate the presence of
several membrane-associated G-protein coupled receptors
specific for progestin pheromones in the olfactory epithelium of goldfish and zebrafish. According to physiological
and biochemical studies, GPCR pheromone receptors
function via Gαi [20]. As mPRα was not identified in either
species and activation of mPRβ does not decrease cAMP,
mPRγ appears to be a good candidate for progestin-related
signaling in the olfactory system. Several splice forms of
the receptor were isolated in both species, one of which
appears be unique to the goldfish olfactory epithelium,
while another was over-represented in zebrafish olfactory
epithelium compared to other tissues. The absence of
mPRγ in the tetrapod olfactory system, its presence in
early vertebrates and its affinity for hydroxyl-containing
progesterone derivatives (but not estrogens, androgens or
glucocorticoids) suggests a specific role for these gene
products in detecting pheromonal progestins in some
fish. In conclusion, we propose PAQR5 and PAQR6

necessary to confirm or discard this hypothesis.

Conclusion
Through comparisons and combination of the goldfish
olfactory epithelium ESTs produced in this study with
those available for zebrafish it was possible to estimate
that the olfactory epithelium transcriptome contain
around 16,400 unigenes and to identify a number of nerv-

ous tissue markers and several elements of signalling
pathways involved in olfaction. For example, 124 GPCRs
were identified and included receptors for cytokines, neurotransmitters, growth and development factors, hormones, steroids and olfactory cues.
The presence of a large number of immune system genes
may reflect the epithelial character of the tissue and also
the necessity for tight control on intensive processes such
as, regeneration of the neuron population which involves
cytokines and immune cells. Hormonal receptors also
help us to understand regulatory mechanisms involved in
the functioning and precise adjustment of the olfactory
system. Growth factor receptors provide an important
tool for developing selective markers for the different cell
types composing this complex tissue and to study processes involved in differentiation of sensory neurons. The
TAAR receptors found in the goldfish olfactory library
were not as diverse as expected from genomic prediction
and expression studies in zebrafish, raising the possibility
of species-specific adaptations in the olfactory system.
One third of the GPCR repertoire was classical ORs and
indicates that fish probably recognize a wide variety of
potential odorants. While most ORs remain orphans, two
subfamilies were linked to specific amino acid subclasses,
long-chain non polar and charged. Receptors known to
bind nucleotides were also identified. We have estimated
that the repertoire of Class A ORs expressed in the olfactory epithelium in cyprinids to be between 45 and 50 and
confirmed this with RT-PCR. Similarly 40–45 TAARs are
estimated to be expressed.
Finally we have identified four members of the membrane
progestin receptor family. Three of them fit the criteria of
possible candidates for main elements in steroid pheromone communication. Namely, they are diverse splice variants of two closely related paralogues of fish maturation
inducing-steroid receptors; they demonstrate an olfactory
system specific profile of expression in fish; and they are
predicted to bind Gαi, which is known to mediate the progestin olfactory response in goldfish. Taken together we
suggest that the group of PAQR5 and PAQR6 gene products could be pheromone receptors in fish, although further studies such as, histochemical and cell culture
expression are needed.

Materials and methods
Isolation of olfactory epithelia
The goldfish used in this study were obtained from a local
pet shop. Fish were anesthetized with MS222 and olfactory tissue was dissected out and placed in liquid nitrogen.
Twenty normal body shaped specimens of 10–15 cm and
20–25 g and of both sexes were used.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/429

Preparation of a cDNA library
Total RNA was extracted with Tri Reagent and treated with
DNAse. mRNA purification and concentration were performed using Dynal's oligo-dT magnetic beads. The normalized olfactory epithelium cDNA library was
constructed using cDNA SMART-kit (Clontech) and thermostable duplex-specific nuclease [96]. Sequencing was
carried out at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular
Genetics (Berlin, Germany) using a Capillary Sequencer
systems, ABI 3730 XL (Applied Biosystems) and MegaBase
4500 (GE Healthcare, formally Amersham-Pharmacia)
and all sequencing reactions were carried out with ABI
BigDye Terminator version 3.1. All the EST sequences
were deposited by dbEST in EMBL http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
embl/ under accession numbers AM925430... AM930226.
Computational methods
The DNA sequence chromatograms were analyzed using
the Phred software [97] for base call and for estimation of
error probability at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular
Genetics. All sequences were edited to remove ribosomal
RNA, polyA tails, low-quality sequences, and vector and
adapter regions. Cross-comparison using Liru local blast
software was carried out and sequences with more than
95% identity were assembled manually. The resulting
contigs and singletons were assessed for similarity to the
protein non-redundant database using BlastX at NCBI
[98] and sequences annotated if the match complied with
the following criteria: e-value < e-10 and > 70% of alignment coverage, or e-40 if only the 3' UTR matched the database. Gene ontology (GO) and Genecards websites were
used for functional annotation of identified genes. All
annotations and GO assignments were curated manually.
To compare GO category counts the WeGo interface was
used [99]. The Gene Ontology category selected as a basis
for transcriptome size estimation was the Glucose Metabolic Process (GO:0006006). To evaluate the number of
orthologous genes present in the library and estimate
transcriptome size, a side to side unigene set comparison
was performed against zebrafish olfactory epithelium
libraries. The libraries used were obtained from NCBI
database Unigene [100], dbEST 2387 "Zebrafish adult
olfactory" from Washington University School of Medicine and dbEST "NIH_ZGC_14" from National Institutes
of Health, Zebrafish Gene Collection. Because none of the
libraries were normalized, as indicated in the data annotation, they were pooled together with summation of
counts for each unigene present in both of them. All
genes, mentioned in the article, were identified from ESTs
or amplified by RT-PCR in one or both fish species olfactory epithelium. Alignments were carried out using ClustalW interface at EBI http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/
clustalw2/.

RT-PCR amplification of olfactory receptors and PAQRs
Total RNA was extracted with Tri Reagent from the olfactory epithelium of 15 goldfish or zebrafish of both sexes
at different seasons. Samples were treated with DNAse
(Quiagen). Specific primers for each family of GPCR Class
A were designed using conserved gene regions identified
by multiple alignment of available olfactory receptors
from teleost fish species. Primers for PAQR genes were
based on sequences from published goldfish sequences
(indicated above). Primers used were: mPRγ 12forwardCACACCTTCAGCACCATGTC; mPRγ 12reverse – TCCAGGTGCCAGTCTCTC;
mPRαβ
forward-TGTGTGGACACACCTGCTGGC;
mPRαβ
reverseGTACAGGACAGCCAGGCCAGGA. Amplification was
performed using a MyCycler (BioRad) thermocycler with
conditions adjusted for each primer pair. The PCR products were cloned in pGem-T-Easy and sequenced in both
directions with T7 and SP6 primers using a 3130x
sequencer (Applied Biosystems).
