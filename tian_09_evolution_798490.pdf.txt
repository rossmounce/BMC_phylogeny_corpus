Abstract
Background: NLRPs (Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, Leucine rich Repeat and Pyrin
domain containing Proteins) are members of NLR (Nod-like receptors) protein family. Recent
researches have shown that NLRP genes play important roles in both mammalian innate immune
system and reproductive system. Several of NLRP genes were shown to be specifically expressed in
the oocyte in mammals. The aim of the present work was to study how these genes evolved and
diverged after their duplication, as well as whether natural selection played a role during their
evolution.
Results: By using in silico methods, we have evaluated the evolution and functional divergence of
NLRP genes, in particular of mouse reproduction-related Nlrp genes. We found that (1) major NLRP
genes have been duplicated before the divergence of mammals, with certain lineage-specific
duplications in primates (NLRP7 and 11) and in rodents (Nlrp1, 4 and 9 duplicates); (2) tandem
duplication events gave rise to a mammalian reproduction-related NLRP cluster including NLRP2, 4,
5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13 and 14 genes; (3) the function of mammalian oocyte-specific NLRP genes (NLRP4,
5, 9 and 14) might have diverged during gene evolution; (4) recent segmental duplications
concerning Nlrp4 copies and vomeronasal 1 receptor encoding genes (V1r) have been undertaken
in the mouse; and (5) duplicates of Nlrp4 and 9 in the mouse might have been subjected to adaptive
evolution.
Conclusion: In conclusion, this study brings us novel information on the evolution of mammalian
reproduction-related NLRPs. On the one hand, NLRP genes duplicated and functionally diversified
in mammalian reproductive systems (such as NLRP4, 5, 9 and 14). On the other hand, during
evolution, different lineages adapted to develop their own NLRP genes, particularly in reproductive
function (such as the specific expansion of Nlrp4 and Nlrp9 in the mouse).

Background
The innate immune system is an ancestral and ubiquitous
system of defense against microbial infection and other
potential threats to the host. The first mammalian molecules shown to be involved in innate immune recognition

of, and defense against, microbial pathogens are the Tolllike receptors (TLRs), which constitute the main sensors
for detection of extracellular microbes [1]. Recent research
has shown that Nod-like receptors (NLRs) act as intracellular regulators of bacterial-induced inflammation [2-4].

The NLR protein family is separated into several subfamilies based on the different N-terminal effecter
domains [5]. The NLRP subfamily (known also as NALP
family) is a new identified NLR group characterized by a
PYRIN domain. Initially, research on the function of
NLRP proteins focused on their roles in apoptotic and
inflammatory signaling pathways via the formation of a
large signaling platform (named inflammasome) and the
activation of caspases in innate immunity [4,6,7]. Interestingly, more and more researches have recently revealed
that some NLRP genes play roles in mammalian reproduction. For instance, the mouse Nlrp5 (known also as
MATER) was one of the first identified mammalian maternal effect genes, i.e. it encodes mRNA required for successful development of a fertilized oocyte [8]. In particular,
the targeted invalidation of mouse oocyte-specific Nlrp5
leads to the sterility of females due to a blockage at the
two-cell stage in the development of embryos [8]. In vitro
knockdown experiments in mouse fertilized eggs also
revealed that a decrease of mouse germ-cell-specific
Nlrp14 transcripts results in an arrest of development
between the one-cell and eight-cell stages of the embryos
[9,10]. In the mouse, exclusive duplications of Nlrp4 and
Nlrp9 have been detected with specific expression profiles
restricted to the oocyte [9], whereas the mouse Nlrp4a and
the cattle NLRP9 have also been reported to be expressed
in the testis [11,12]. In humans, the mutations of NLRP7
are found to cause recurrent hydatidiform moles, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths and intrauterine growth retardation [13,14]. Additionally, the recent expression
analyses of NLRP genes in the human and the rhesus
macaque (Macaca mulatta) have shown that most if not all
NLRP genes are expressed in primate gametes and early
embryos, suggesting a role of NLRPs in primate preimplantation development [15,16].
Overall, it seems that the NLRP genes play roles not only
in innate immunity but also in the reproductive system of
mammals. Moreover, Nalp5 and Nalp14 invalidation data
in the mouse suggests that there is no functional compensation of each of these oocyte-specific genes. In this context, one question is to study how these reproductionrelated NLRP genes evolved and diverged in function after
their duplication, as well as whether natural selection
played a role during their evolution.
The availability of several completely sequenced vertebrate genomes allows us to use a phylogenomic approach
to identify the NLRP orthologues from different mammals
and to evaluate the evolutionary features of NLRPs in different lineages. In this paper, we focus on the evolution
and functional divergence of reproduction-related NLRPs,
as well as lineage-specific expansion of Nlrp4 and Nlrp9 in
rodents. The aim of the present work is to provide new
information in understanding how NLRP genes evolve in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/202

reproductive system and how different mammals adapted
to develop their own NLRP gene copies particularly in
reproductive biology.

Results
Phylogeny and syntenic comparison of NLRPs
A total of 83 mammalian NLRP amino acid sequences
with chicken NLRP3-like as outgroup were used for the
reconstruction of phylogenetic trees. A total of 122 positions are included in the final dataset.

In the consensus phylogenetic tree (Figure 1), each NLRP
protein, except for NLRP2, is shown to be monophyletic
by all four methods with high bootstrap values. NLRP2
encompasses the primate-specific NLRP7, suggesting the
origin of NLRP7 from a duplication of the NLRP2/7 ancestor in primates. NLRP11 is also primate-specific and
might be related to the reproduction-related NLRP4 and
9. NLRP4 proteins are only identified in primates and
rodents, indicating the potential birth of the ancestral
NLRP4 gene before the divergence between primates and
rodents. Otherwise, the other NLRP genes seem to have
duplicated before the divergence of mammals.
In rodents, three Nlrp genes show lineage-specific duplications including Nlrp1, Nlrp4 and Nlrp9 (Figure 1). More
specifically, Nlrp1 exclusively duplicated in the mouse,
Nlrp9 duplicated independently in the rodents after the
separation of mouse and rat, whereas the duplication of
Nlrp4 is likely to have occurred both before and after this
separation.
Unexpectedly, NLRP8 and NLRP13 seem to be universal
in mammals except for rodents. We speculate that these
two genes might have been lost during evolution of the
rodents. Unfortunately, our tBLASTn search (using the
human NLRP8 and 13 respectively as queries against the
mouse genome) failed to find any trace of pseudogene of
neither NLRP8 nor NLRP13 within the mouse conserved
syntenic region. We found that, on the human chromosome 19, these two genes are located side by side between
NLRP4 and NLRP5, whereas the mouse Nlrp4 gene has
been expansively duplicated and the duplicates are
located around Nlrp5 on the mouse chromosome 7. In
rodents, the biological significance of the probable loss of
NLRP8 and 13 on one hand, and the parallel expansion of
Nlrp4 on the other hand, remains unknown.
Remarkably, our phylogenetic analyses identified a well
supported (bootstrap values >90% by ME, NJ and ML
methods) reproduction-related clade including nine
NLRP proteins: NLRP2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13 and 14 (Figure
1). All these NLRP genes have been shown to be expressed
in the human oocyte and pre-implantation embryos [16].
NLRP4, 5, 8, 9 and 14 are exclusively expressed in germ-

cells, especially in the oocyte of mammals [8-12,17,18].
The mutations of NLRP7 are associated with abnormal
embryo development in the human [13,14]. The expression of mouse Nlrp2 has been found to be highly enriched
in fully grown oocytes but diminished in the 2-cell
embryos upon embryo genome activation [19]. In both
the human [16] and the rhesus macaque [15], NLRP11
and 13 have been found specifically or preferentially
expressed in the oocyte, with a similar expression pattern
to other oocyte-specific NLRP genes, i.e., enriched in
maturing oocytes and then progressively diminished in
embryos, indicating an exclusive maternal origin of these
transcripts. Unfortunately, the biological study of these
two genes is not sufficient to address their putative roles
in reproduction.

tain V1r genes (discussed below) on chromosome 7A1
and 7A3. Although NLRP14 is not located in the syntenic
region encompassing other reproduction-related NLRPs
in all the studied mammalian genomes (involving cattle,
dog, human, chimpanzee, mouse and rat), our phylogenetic result and the published expression profile show
that this gene is close to other reproduction-related
NLRPs. This suggests that early (before the divergence of
mammals) genomic rearrangements might have resulted
in the separation of NLRP14 from its relatives.
We identified the other NLRP members (NLRP1, 3, 6, 10
and 12) as non-reproduction-related NLRP genes, because
they are not in the reproduction-related clade in the phylogenetic trees and ubiquitously expressed. These genes
have been shown to participate in inflammatory and
immune responses by regulating the activation of other
signaling factors, such as NF-κB, caspase-1 and IL-1β [2024]. In contrast, little is known about the function of the
reproduction-related NLRP proteins in inflammation and
immunity, except that the human NLRP2, 4 and 7 may be
able to inhibit IL-1β and/or NF-κB [25-28], and thus may
contribute to modulate the inflammatory response. It is
known that inflammation and bacterial infection can
cause infertility, ectopic pregnancy and abortion [29].
Thus, NLRP proteins might play roles both in innate
immunity and in reproductive biology.

Moreover, this reproduction-related clade is also supported by the syntenic analysis (Figure 2). In the human
genome, all the reproduction-related NLRP genes, except
for NLRP14, are tandemly located on the chromosome
19q13.42, suggesting that multiple tandem duplication
events might have given birth to these genes. The similar
arrangements of the reproduction-related NLRPs are also
found in cattle and dog genomes (Figure 2). In the mouse
genome, the reproduction-related Nlrps (except for
Nlrp14) are not located side by side, but interrupted by
some other types of genes, especially and mainly by cer-

Functional divergence
In the reproduction-related NLRP cluster referred by the
phylogenetic analysis above, there are several oocyte-specific NLRP genes including NLRP4, 5, 8, 9 and 14. To
investigate whether functional divergence have occurred
following the duplications of these oocyte-specific NLRPs,
four oocyte-expressed NLRP genes (NLRP4, 5, 9 and 14)
were estimated for functional divergence by using the
DIVERGE program [30]. NLRP8, which was not found in
rodents, was therefore not included in this analysis in
order to compare the level of divergence across all candidate species.

After alignment and removal of the sites with gaps, a total
of 650 amino acid sites are included in the analysis. Pairwise comparisons of each of the four oocyte-expressed
NLRP gene clusters (Additional file 1) were carried out
and the rate of amino acid evolution at each sequence
position was estimated. As shown in Table 1, functional
divergence is significant between each comparison (θ > 0
with p < 0.001) by both MFE and MLE methods, indicating that site-specific altered selective constraints should
contribute to the functional evolution of the oocyte-specific NLRP genes after their duplication.
Furthermore, the important amino acid residues, responsible for functional divergence, were predicted by calculating the site-specific profile based on posterior analysis for
all pairs of clusters with functional divergence. In order to
extensively reduce false positive, cutoff values, i.e., the
minimal posterior probabilities for RFD (Residues with
predicted Functional Divergence) were established empirically by progressively removing the highest scoring residues from the alignment until θ dropped to zero. As
shown in Table 1, the least RFD (33 residues, covering
5.1% of a total of 650 aligned sites) are observed between
NLRP5 and NLRP14, and the most RFD (118 residues,
covering 18.2% of a total of 650 aligned sites) are
observed between NLRP4 and NLRP14. In general, the
RFD are detected in all three functional domains
(NACHT, PYRIN and LRRs) of NLRP proteins, implying

that shifted functional constrains might have acted on
each protein domain.
Segmental duplications concerning Nlrp4 and V1r genes
in the mouse genome
In the mouse, there are seven Nlrp4 gene copies (named
from Nlrp4a to 4g) which are specifically expressed in
oocytes [9,11]. Our lab has also found the expression of
Nlrp4a in the testis by RT-PCR [11]. Nlrp4a-4e genes are
located on chromosome 7A, but Nlrp4f and 4g are located
on chromosomes 13B3 and chromosome 9 respectively.
By the tBLASTn method, we identified six additional putative pseudogenes on chromosome 7A (named here
ΨNlrp4h-4m, Figure 3a). Based on the phylogenetic tree
(Figure 3a), multiple duplications of mouse Nlrp4 could
be depicted as follows. Nlrp4b might be the earliest Nlrp4
copy in the mouse genome with an orthologue present in
the rat genome, suggesting an origin before the separation
of mouse and rat. The duplication of ancestral Nlrp4b is
supposed to have given rise to Nlrp4d, and the subsequent
duplications might have resulted in Nlrp4f/4g and Nlrp4a/
4c. Subsequent chromosomal rearrangements might have
caused the independent locations of Nlrp4f and Nlrp4g
with other Nlrp4 duplicates. All the putative Nlrp4h-4m
pseudogene sequences show high identities with each
other as well as with Nlrp4e. In fact, in all the pseudogenes, a common frameshift of 1-bp deletion was detected
at the position corresponding to 358aa of Nlrp4e and it
caused a subsequent prematural stop codon at the position of 434aa, suggesting that the pseudogenization had
happened before duplications of these copies.

In the mouse genome, Nlrp4 duplicates (except for Nlrp4f
and 4g) are located between 6.00 Mb and 27.32 Mb on the
chromosome 7. Interestingly, all these Nlrp4 duplicates
are found next to the vomeronasal 1 receptor encoding
genes (V1r), such as V1rd and V1re genes (Figure 3a). The
phylogeny and genomic location of these V1r genes reveal
that V1r genes might have a similar duplication model to
their neighbors, Nlrp4 genes (Figure 3a). Thus, one may
hypothesize that Nlrp4 may have not duplicated one by

region, other more recent segmental duplications (concerning pseudogenized Nlrp4 copy and V1rd genes) have been undertaken several times. We note that the order of duplication events in this potential scenario is mainly based on the topology of

Vomeronasal organ, which is well developed in rodents in
comparison with human, detects pheromones and other
chemical signals implicated in innate reproductive and
social behaviours between the members of the same spe-

cies [31,32]. The V1r gene family is supposed to have
emerged during the divergence of placental mammals
(80110 MYA), but many subfamilies including V1rd and
V1re originated only in rodents after their separation from
the primates [33], which is consistent with the rodent-specific duplication of Nlrp4. Thus, the phylogenetic relationship and genomic location (Figure 3a) of these V1r genes,

that are located in the segmental duplication region,
could help us to better understand the segmental duplications. Overall, as shown in Figure 3b, a presumed itinerary
of segmental duplication was deduced by combining phylogeny with genomic location of both Nlrp4 duplicates
and V1r genes. Although we can not confirm the order of
duplication events by the present data, we can state that
segmental duplication events characterize the evolution
of this genomic region.

genes might have been subjected to positive selection after
their expansion. Furthermore, the comparison of model
MEC (AICc = 15913.11 for Nlrp4_mouse and AICc =
14196.22 for Nlrp9_mouse) versus model M8a (AICc =
16003.68 for Nlrp4_mouse and AICc = 14293.43 for
Nlrp9_mouse) also supports positive selection in these
two gene clusters. The AICc scores of MEC are lower than
those of M8a, indicating that MEC better fits the data, i.e.
positive selection is significant.

Positive selection on Nlrp4 and Nlrp9 paralogues in the
mouse
Several examples have shown that genes in duplication
blocks could be maintained by positive selection [34-37].
Here, we implemented PAML4 [38] to investigate the
model of selective force acting on mouse Nlrp4 and Nlrp9
duplicates during their evolution.

Subsequently, we wanted to know if the target of positive
selection had changed during evolution in these two gene
clades. We compared the potential sites subjected to positive selection between the two datasets (Table 2). In
Nlrp4_mouse dataset, 2 sites (133C and 677V) are identified as positively selected sites at p > 95% level by both
M2a and M8 models, and 2 more sites (153S and 657N)
are identified only by the M8 model. In Nlrp9_mouse
dataset, 10 sites (106H, 123 E, 356F, 360L, 378R, 513E,
536V, 571V, 661L and 948A) are identified as potential
targets of positive selection by both M2a and M8 models,
and 1 more sites (278L) is identified only by the M8
model. We note that no common sites are shared by the
two datasets as positively selected sites at p > 95% level,
suggesting a dramatic shift in the target of positive selection between the Nlrp4 and Nlrp9 genes in the mouse.

By using Site Models, estimates of the parameter values
under M2a and M8 (Table 2) indicate that a fraction of
sites (about 56%) may be under positive selection in both
datasets (Nlrp4_mouse and Nlrp9_mouse). LRTs of all

When the 3D structures or models of these proteins are
available in the future, we could investigate whether these
positively selected sites are located in functionally pivotal
regions.

Discussion
Independent evolution of reproduction-related NLRP
genes in different mammalian lineages
Phylogenetic analyses show that NLRP genes have been
originated and duplicated before the divergence of mammals. Certain genes are well conserved during their evolution, such as NLRP3 (82% identity between the human
and the mouse), whereas many genes involved in reproduction have rapidly evolved resulting in higher sequence
divergence among lineages, such as NLRP5 (50% identity
between the human and the mouse) and NLRP14 (62%
identity between the human and the mouse). The pairwise estimates of evolutionary divergence between the
reproduction-related paralogues are ranged from 61% to
75% (except that the pairwise distance between NLRP2
and its recent primate-specific duplicate, NLRP7, is 45%),
which is obviously higher than the one between the nonreproduction-related paralogues (ranged from 43% to
69%). Moreover, gene duplication and/or gene loss is
found to have occurred independently in different mammalian lineages. On the one hand, Nlrp4 (originated
before the divergence of primates and rodents) and Nlrp9
have been extensively duplicated in rodents, and other
lineage-specific gene duplication events concern the specific duplication of Nlrp1 (three paralogues) in the mouse
as well as the unique origin of NLRP7 and NLRP11 in primates. On the other hand, Nlrp8 and Nlrp13 are seemed
to be lost from the genomes of rodents. Interestingly, the
major gene duplication and gene loss events are found to
be associated with the reproduction-related genes (such as
NLRP4, 7, 8, 9, 11 and 13), implying that reproductionrelated genes have undertaken a fast and diverged evolution among different mammalian lineages. Given note
that major reproduction-related NLRP genes are germ-cell
specific, whereas the other non-reproduction-related
genes are usually expressed in multiple tissues from a single organism. Recent large-scale gene expression studies
have shown that the tissue specificity of genes is correlated
positively with gene evolution rates [39-41]. Furthermore,
our result reinforces the hypothesis that reproductionrelated genes are most highly divergent and evolve more
rapidly than genes expressed in other organs [42-45].
Functional divergence of the oocyte-specific genes
Gene duplication is thought to be the essential source of
gene novelty, with new or altered functions, as shown by
widespread existence of gene families. Among NLRP
genes, there are at least four oocyte specifically expressed
in mammals, including NLRP4, 5, 9 and 14. These genes
have been found to be restricted expressed in oocytes and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/202

early embryos [9,15], suggesting their important roles in
oogenesis and preimplantation embryo development.
Additionally, their temporal expression in oocytes and
degradation during preimplantation development coincide with the timing of gene expression transition from
maternal to zygotic control, indicating their roles as
maternal effect genes.
In the present work, by using an in silico method (with the
help of the program DIVERGE), we demonstrate that the
functional divergence could have occurred between each
pair of oocyte-specific NLRP genes. This result is supported by certain published experimental data. For example, the knock-out of mouse Nlrp5 induced female
infertility due to a blockage of early embryonic development [8]; and the injection of siRNA against Nlrp14 into
fertilized eggs resulted in arrested development of
embryos between 1-cell and 8-cell stages [9]. These results
suggest that the expression of other oocyte-specific NLRP
genes is not able to compensate the absence of neither
NLRP5 nor NLRP14 genes. Additionally, recent research
has shown that NLRP14 is also expressed in the testis and
its mutation might cause spermatogenic failure in the
human [46]. Thus, we presume that the expressional
divergence of NLRP5 and NLRP14 during the development of mouse germ-cells and embryos may lead to functional specialization. On the other hand, target
invalidation/inhibition of NLRP5 and 14 did not reveal
any deleterious effect on ovarian folliculogenesis but
rather in early embryonic development, suggesting other
genes might play the similar roles during folliculogenesis
and meiotic maturation. For these latter functions, plausible candidates could be other oocyte-specific NLRP genes,
such as NLRP4 and NLRP9. To investigate this possibility,
further functional studies such as knock-out models or
other targeted inhibition experiments on these genes
should be carried out.
Gene duplication is thought to be a major driving force in
enabling the evolution of tissue specialization. By using
microarray gene expression data from mammals [47],
fruit flies and yeast [48], it has recently shown that as gene
family size enlarges, there is a general trend for paralogous
genes with decreased breadth and increased specificity of
expression. In particular, by studying the relationship
between gene family size and expression breadth of 1249
protein families in the mouse, Freilich and his colleagues
[49] have recently demonstrated that duplicates that arose
through post-multicellularity duplication events show a
tendency to become more specifically expressed, supporting the view suggested by the subfunctionalization model
[50]. In our case, especially with the evidence that NLRP5
and NLRP14 genes are significantly involved in different
developmental stages of embryos, we hypothesize that the
functional divergence of oocyte-specific NLRP duplicates

Page 8 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:202

might be derived by the expression specialization of
duplicate genes, which could provide the mammals reproductive advantages such as in adaptation.
Segmental duplication in the mouse genome
The phylogenetic research indicates the rodent-specific
expansion of Nlrp4 and NLRP9, and the furthermore
genomic analyses find that these Nlrp duplicates, especially Nlrp4, have been duplicated together with other
genes, such as V1r copies. This segmental duplication is
not rare during the mouse and human genomic evolution.
It has recently revealed that the segmental duplication
constitutes about 5% of mouse genome, and its distribution is in a highly non-random fashion [51]. Interestingly,
the duplication blocks account for 32% of the first 50 Mb
of the chromosome 7, where the segmental duplications
concerning Nlrp4 and V1r genes are located. Nlrp9 has
been also duplicated in this region, but its duplication scenario is not clear and might be due to subsequent recombination.

As found in the human [52], the segmental duplication
regions in the mouse might also be "hot spots" for the
occurrence of non-allelic homologous recombination,
leading to genomic mutations such as deletion, duplication, inversion or translocation [53-55]. Thus, these instable regions might have a biological significance in form of
genome evolution [56,57].
Adaptive diversification after gene duplications in Nlrp4
and Nlrp9
In the mouse, Nlrp4 and Nlrp9 are specifically extensive in
gene copies. By using Site-Models implemented in
PAML4, we evaluated the variation of selective pressure
acting on Nlrp4 and Nlrp9 duplicates, respectively. Our
result shows that positive selection is significant in both
datasets, which consistent with other reports referring that
the rapid divergence of the reproductive genes may be
driven by positive selection [43,58]. In particular, in the
mouse, several gene cluster concerning lineage-specific
expansion of reproduction-related genes have been found
to be under adaptive evolution (positive selection), such
as the Sva (seminal vesicle autoantigen) gene cluster [59],
the Prame (or oogenesin) gene cluster [60], the Psg (pregnancy-specific glycoprotein) gene cluster [61], the Rhox4
gene cluster [62] and the Svs (seminal vesicle secretion
proteins) gene cluster [63]. The lineage-independent
expansion and subsequently rapid evolution of such
genes might contribute to speciation or adaptation, such
as genetic barriers between species and hybrid incompatibilities, or provide the species specification in reproductive processes such as sperm competition, host immunity
to pathogens, and manipulation of female/male reproductive physiology and behavior. In the case of NLRP4
and 9 genes, their biological functions are still unclear, so

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/202

we can not evaluate the significance of their specific duplications in the reproduction of the mouse. However, the
similar evolutionary mechanism driven by positive selection suggests that after duplication, these NLRP gene copies diverged and acquired abilities (probably by
subfunctionalization) to adapt the new environment. In
the subsequent research, the adaptive evolution of the
other reproduction-related NLRP genes could be further
evaluated. Hopefully, when the biological functions of
these NLRP genes are elucidated, the nature of the selective pressure acting on NLRPs will be better understood.
Interestingly, the evolution of V1r genes, the other genes
involved in the segmental duplication with Nlrp4 and 9, is
also driven by positive selection in rodents [33]. V1R proteins are thought to be responsible for the detection of
pheromones that induce innate reproductive behaviors
between members of the same species [31,32]. Thus, it is
presumed that the adaptive evolution of the V1r genes
might play an important role in reinforcing pre-zygotic
barriers among species of rodents [33].

Conclusion
NLRP genes have originated and duplicated mainly before
the divergence of mammals. During evolution, NLRPs,
especially the reproduction-related NLRP genes, have
undergone a fast and independent diversification in different mammalian lineages. The expansion of reproduction-related NLRP genes has been associated with
functional divergence after duplication, suggesting that
each NLRP oocyte-specific gene might play an essential
role in oogenesis and early preimplantation embryo
development. The mouse-specific expansion of Nlrp4 and
Nlrp9, concerning segmental duplication events, has been
driven by positive evolution. Our founding suggests that
the duplication and functional divergence of NLRP might
provide mammals advantages in reproductive biology.

Methods
Molecular phylogenetic and syntenic analyses
The protein sequences of all the 14 known human NLRPs
were
retrieved
from
the
GenBank
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. The NLRP proteins from other
species were searched by PSI-BLAST [64] with human
NLRP protein sequences as queries against the protein
databases (NCBI: RefSeq protein databases) of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), dog (Canis familiaris), cattle (Bos taurus), mouse (Mus musculus), rat (Rattus norvegicus) and
chicken (Gallus gallus). The predicted coding sequences of
the best hit proteins were retrieved when the hits presented more than 80% in length to be aligned with the
query sequence (with E values < 10-100). These settings
could effectively detect the potential NLRP members from
different species but avoid involving the relative NLR proteins from other protein subfamilies. After removal of

redundant sequences, the initial data set (Additional file
2) for NLRP phylogenetic studies includes 83 protein
sequences from 6 mammals and 1 sequence from chicken.
Analyses of the orthologous and paralogous relationships
among different species were carried out by combining
the phylogenetic reconstruction of the gene family with
the syntenic comparison. Multiple sequence alignments
were performed using the Clustal W algorithm [65] and
then manually edited. The alignment was submitted as
Online Additional file 3. All alignment gap sites were
eliminated before phylogenetic analyses. The phylogenetic trees were reconstructed with Neighbor Joining (NJ),
Minimum-Evolution (ME) and Maximum Parsimony
(MP) methods implemented in MEGA4 [66], as well as
with Maximum Likelihood (ML) method implemented in
PhyML [67]. The consensus phylogenetic tree [68] was
generated by the fusion of the independent trees reconstructed by the four methods. In all analyses, chicken
NLRP protein (Q5F3J4) was treated as the root of all the
mammalian NLRPs. The bootstrap values [69] were estimated with 1000 replications. The syntenic comparison is
based on Ensembl http://www.ensembl.org/index.html
utilities such as "orthologue prediction" and "view syntenic regions".
Test for functional divergence of oocyte-specific NLRP
genes
The program DIVERGE [30] was used to estimate type I
functional divergence [70,71] between oocyte-expressed
NLRP paralogues (NLRP4, 5, 9 and 14). Type I sites represent amino acid residues conserved in one clade (gene
cluster) but highly variable in another, suggesting that
these residues have been subjected to different functional
constraints. Statistically, this functional divergence
between two clades is measured by the coefficient of functional divergence, θ, ranging from 0 to 1. A null hypothesis of θ = 0 indicates that the evolutionary rate is virtually
the same between two duplicate genes at each site [70,71].
If the null hypothesis was rejected, a site-specific profile
was then used to predict the critical amino acid residues
most likely to be responsible for the detected functional
divergence.

A set of 33 protein sequences from mammalian NLRP4, 5,
9 and 14 is included in the analysis. Sequences of rat
NLRP4d, 9a and 14 were excluded from the alignment
because of their shorter lengths. Before the use of
DIVERGE, our sequence dataset was examined to satisfy
the conditions recommended by Gu et Vander Velden
(2002), which permit us to obtain higher efficiency of
detecting functional divergence-related residues: 1) each
cluster has more than four amino acid sequences; (2) all
pairwise sequence identities are <90%; and (3) multiple
alignment is reliable. The phylogenetic tree used for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/202

DIVERGE was reconstructed by MEGA4 [66] with ME
method. The coefficients of functional divergence (θ)
between gene clusters are calculated by Model-Free Estimation (MFE) and Maximum-Likelihood Estimation
under two-state model (MLE). To detect amino acid residues reflecting functional divergence, all four reproduction-related NLRP gene clades were compared to each
other.
Investigation of mouse specific segmental duplications
In order to investigate the predicted segmental duplications concerning Nlrp4 duplicates on the mouse chromosome 7, a tBLASTn search [64] was implemented by using
the mouse Nlrp4a (the longest Nlrp4 sequence) as a query
against the mouse genome. This method permitted us to
identify both expressed Nlrp4 genes and traces of the pseudogenes. Then we combined phylogenetic analyses and
genomic mapping to identify the segmental duplication
[35]. The phylogenetic tree of mouse Nlrp4 genes and
pseudogenes was reconstructed by using nucleotide
sequences instead of protein sequences. The phylogenetic
tree was also reconstructed for vomeronasal 1 receptor
proteins (V1R), because their encoding genes are located
paralleling to Nlrp4 duplicates in the mouse genome and
they are presumed to have duplicated together with Nlrp4.
The accession numbers of the V1R protein sequences used
here are listed in Additional file 4. The genomic organization of all the concerned genes and pseudogenes in the
mouse is inferred from Ensembl (release 49).
Evolutionary analyses
To examine whether the duplicates of Nlrp4 and Nlrp9 in
the mouse have been submitted to adaptive evolution, an
analysis of variation in selective pressure following gene
duplication events was carried out with the CODEML program implemented in PAML4 [38]. The alignments were
resulted from Clustal W and PAL2NAL [72]. The shorter
mouse Nlrp4g was excluded in order to obtain more
informative sites.

Two datasets named Nlrp4_mouse (including 7
sequences) and Nlrp9_mouse (including 3 sequences)
were investigated for different Site Models [73] implemented in PAML4. In this study, we employed three pairs
of models including M1a (NearlyNeutral: 0< ω0 <1 and ω1
= 1) versus M2a (PositiveSelection: 0< ω0 <1, ω1 = 1 and
ωs >1) [73], M7 (beta: 0< ω <1) versus M8 (beta and ω: 0<
ω <1 and ωs >1) [74], and M8a (beta &ωs = 1: 0< ω <1 and
ωs = 1) versus M8 [75]. LRTs (Likelihood Ratio Tests) were
used to test for significant differences in the fit of the models incorporating selection relative to their (nested) counterparts that did not allow positive selection [73]. These
tests provide a useful series of metrices for interpreting the
significance of the results and a degree of protection
against false positives [76]. Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB)

method [77] implemented in PAML4 was used to estimate posterior probabilities of selection on each codon.
Furthermore, a newly described model MEC [78] was also
employed on the Selecton Server [79] to compare with the
results from other models for positive selection. The
advantage of the MEC model over the other models used
here is that by treating specifically each amino-acid
replacement, Ka is computed differently. So under the
MEC model, a position with radical replacements will
obtain a higher Ka value than a position with more moderate replacements [78].
