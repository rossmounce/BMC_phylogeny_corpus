Abstract
Background: Virological, molecular and serological studies were carried out to determine the status of infections
with avian influenza viruses (AIV) in different species of wild waterbirds in Iran during 2003-2007. Samples were
collected from 1146 birds representing 45 different species with the majority of samples originating from ducks,
coots and shorebirds. Samples originated from 6 different provinces representative for the 15 most important
wintering sites of migratory waterbirds in Iran.
Results: Overall, AIV were detected in approximately 3.4% of the samples. However, prevalence was higher (up to
8.3%) at selected locations and for certain species. No highly pathogenic avian influenza, including H5N1 was
detected. A total of 35 AIVs were detected from cloacal or oropharyngeal swab samples. These positive samples
originated mainly from Mallards and Common Teals.
Of 711 serum samples tested for AIV antibodies, 345 (48.5%) were positive by using a nucleoprotein-specific competitive ELISA (NP-C-ELISA). Ducks including Mallard, Common Teal, Common Pochard, Northern Shoveler and Eurasian Wigeon revealed the highest antibody prevalence ranging from 44 to 75%.
Conclusion: Results of these investigations provide important information about the prevalence of LPAIV in wild
birds in Iran, especially wetlands around the Caspian Sea which represent an important wintering site for migratory
water birds. Mallard and Common Teal exhibited the highest number of positives in virological and serological
investigations: 43% and 26% virological positive cases and 24% and 46% serological positive reactions, respectively.
These two species may play an important role in the ecology and perpetuation of influenza viruses in this region.
In addition, it could be shown that both oropharyngeal and cloacal swab samples contribute to the detection of
positive birds, and neither should be neglected.

Background
Wild waterbirds are considered the main reservoir of all
subtypes of avian influenza viruses (AIV). Low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) are widely distributed in wild avian
species around the world. They have been most frequently identified in waterbirds of the orders Anseriformes (including ducks, geese and swans) and
Charadriiformes (particularly gulls and terns). These
viruses replicate in epithelial cells of the respiratory and
intestinal tracts of birds, and are excreted in high

concentrations in their faeces [1]. It is now well recognized that global influenza virus surveillance in wild
birds is important in understanding the role of wild
birds in the epidemiology and ecology of these viruses.
After expansion of HPAIV H5N1 from Southeast Asia
into many Eurasian and African countries, the frequency
and intensity of avian influenza surveys in the world
increased dramatically. In particular North American
and European countries gathered massive epidemiological information regarding circulation of AIV in wild
birds. Yet, little is known about the prevalence of AIV
in wild birds in West & Central Asian countries and the

Middle East. Many countries in this region were severely
affected by HPAI H5N1 in late 2005 and early 2006,
with recurrent outbreaks since 2007 [2]. In Iran, two
outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 have been officially reported
in wild birds and domestic poultry during 2006 and
2008, respectively.
The wetlands located in the southern part of the Caspian Sea represent major wintering and stopover sites
during migration for many wild waterbirds from Siberia
and northern Russia. Several million migratory birds
usually arrive in October and either remain until February/March or migrate further south.
Here, we describe the results of four years of AIV surveillance in wild birds by using different virological,
molecular and serological methods. This study provides
the first extensive survey of AIV in wild birds in West
and Central Asia and the Middle East.

Methods
Sampling plan

Samples were collected from 1146 waterbirds belonging
to 45 species (11 families, Table 1). The samples were
mainly obtained from captured or hunted birds, or during ringing activities. Mist nets with mesh sizes of 20 ×
20 and 50 × 50 mm were used to capture the birds for
sampling. Samples were collected between October and
March from 2003 to 2007 at 18 sites located in six provinces of Iran including Mazandaran, Gilan, West Azerbaijan, Tehran, Fars and Khuzestan (Figure 1). The
sampling sites comprise the most important wetlands of
Iran, serving as wintering sites for migratory waterbirds.
The majority of samples (83%) were collected from
birds staging in the wetlands along the southern shores
of the Caspian Sea which form an important ecological
site for wild migratory birds along the Central Asia
flyway.
During 2003-2005 only cloacal samples (n = 631) and
in 2007 cloacal and oropharyngeal samples were collected. In addition, 711 serum samples were collected
from 27 different species (Tables 2 &3). In 2006, sampling was not permitted due to an HPAI H5N1 outbreak
in the wild bird population in Iran.
In 2007, in the framework of an international collaboration, birds were sampled in duplicate and tested
independently by reference laboratories of the World
Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) at the FriedrichLoeffler-Institut (FLI), Germany and the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (ISZ-Ve), Italy, as
well as at the Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD), France. Cloacal and oropharyngeal samples were collected with cotton swabs,
stored in viral transport medium (Hank’s medium or
PBS) containing antibiotics and antimycotics (plus 5%
calf serum during 2003-2005) and maintained at -70°C

after arrival at the laboratory. Serum samples were
stored at -20°C until tested.
Diagnostic procedures

The samples from 2003-2004 were analyzed by virus
isolation (VI) at the Razi Institute, Iran, and real-time
reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) at the FriedrichLoeffler-Institut (FLI), Germany, whilst positive samples
were further characterized at the FLI. The samples from
2005 were analysed only by virus isolation (at the Razi
Institute) and two positive samples were further characterized at the FLI.
In 2007, rRT-PCR was performed for screening and
only PCR-positive samples were processed for virus isolation. Samples duplicated in the field were analysed at
the FLI (rRT-PCR and VI) and at CIRAD (France) (rRTPCR) and the IZS-Ve (Italy) (VI).
Isolates were characterized by conventional hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and neuraminidase inhibition
(NI) assays, and subsequently confirmed by subtype specific RT-PCR assays and sequencing. The subtypes of
PCR-positive but isolation-negative samples, were determined by subtype specific RT-PCR, DNA microarray
and sequencing.
Virus isolation and characterization

Virus isolation was carried out in specific pathogen free
(SPF) embryonated chicken eggs based on standard procedures [3].
RNA extraction, RT-PCR and Real-time RT-PCR

RNA was extracted either using the QIAamp Viral RNA
kit (Qiagen) for swab materials (field samples), or the
High Pure Viral RNA kit (Roche) for virus isolates
(allantoic fluids), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The 2007 samples were processed by automated RNA extraction (Freedom Evo 3000, Tecan)
using the NucleoSpin 96 Virus Core kit (Macherey &
Nagel).
Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays were performed on the basis of one-step protocols using appropriate RT-PCR Kits (Qiagen or Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturers’ instructions. Subtype specific RTPCR assays using specific primers for different HA [4]
and NA [5] were used for subtype identification or confirmation. Degenerate consensus primers were used for
full length amplification and further sequencing of different viral segments [6].
The samples were tested by a modified TaqMan onestep real-time RT-PCR assay targeting the influenza A
virus M gene [7], an H5 subtype gene fragment and an
H7 subtype gene fragment [3]. Brilliant QRT-PCR kit
(Stratagene), SuperScript III One-step RT-PCR kit with
Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and one-

step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) were used on a MX3000P
Real-Time PCR System (Stratagene). In all tests, negative RNA preparation controls and negative and positive rRT-PCR controls as well as an internal
transcription and amplification control (IC-2) were
included [8].
Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses

PCR products of the anticipated size range were purified
from agarose gels using the QIAquick Gel Extraction
Kit (Qiagen). Purified DNA fragments were cycle-

sequenced in both directions using the same primers as
for RT-PCR. The Prism Big Dye Terminator v1.1 cycle
sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) was used and
amplicons were analysed on an automatic sequencer
(ABI-377, Applied Biosystems). Assembled nucleotide
sequences were then used in BlastN2 database searches
for subtype specification. Phylogenetic analyses were
carried out for complete open reading frame of HA
gene of selected H9N2 AIV using the neighbour-joining
(NJ) method, with 1000 bootstrap replicates implemented in the MEGA 4 programme [9].

Competitive ELISA

HA assay was performed based on standard protocols
[3] using reference antisera prepared from 30 different
viruses representing all 16 avian influenza HA subtypes
and 9 different avian paramyxoviruses. The previously
described NI assay was used for determination of the
NA subtype of virus isolates from 2003-2004 [5].

An in-house competitive ELISA method was used for
testing of 217 serum samples from 2003-2004 [11]. For
the investigation of 494 serum samples collected during
2005-2007 (Table 4), a cELISA kit based on the same
assay principle was used (ID Screen, Influenza A NP
Antibody Competition, ID.VET). The cut-off value of
this test was used as recommended by the suppliers.

Pathogenicity assessment

Microarray

Two isolates from 2003 and 2004 of subtypes H7N3 and
H9N2 were selected for IVPI testing [3] due to the
potential pathogenicity of these subtypes for domestic
poultry. Pathogenicity of two H5 isolates from 2007 was
determined by sequencing of the HA cleavage site and
restriction enzyme cleavage pattern (RECP) assay [10].

Microarray was used for HA and NA subtyping of samples with low viral load and which therefore did not
yield enough PCR amplificates for PCR subtyping or
sequencing. Sample RNA was amplified by RT-PCR
assays using biotinylated generic pan HA and pan NA
primers. An in vitro transcript ‘LPC-pan HA’ and a ‘no
template control’ were included in every run. Microarray
detection of the biotinylated PCR products was done as
described by Gall et al. [12].

Western blot analysis

Western blot analysis was carried out according to
Kothlow et al. [13], to support the cELISA results of
selected serum samples. Briefly, after separation of
purified virus by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis proteins were blotted onto
nitrocellulose membrane, and strips were incubated
with 1:250 diluted test and control sera overnight.
After the respective washing steps, bound duck immunoglobulin (Ig) was detected by mAb (1:2000 dilution)
recognising Ig of several species followed by incubation
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-antimouse Ig-specific polyclonal antibody (Sigma). Finally,
strips were allowed to react with a horseradish peroxidase substrate (ECL plus Western Blotting Detection
System, Amersham Biosciences) and the reaction was
visualized by autoradiography on X-ray film. Sera
which reacted at least with either the NP or the M
protein were considered positive. Sera from 8 mallards
hatched and kept under quarantine, were used as Western blot negative controls.

Results

Temporal and geographical distribution of AIV

Detection of LPAIV in Iran

During five months of sampling in different years and
different provinces, the highest numbers of positive
samples were found in February and November (Figure
2). The number of samples collected in this study was
not distributed evenly over different months. Approximately 66% of samples (n = 759) were collected during
February and early March (2004, 2005 and 2007). 88%
of positive samples were found in this portion of samples, though 78% of samples collected during this period
originated from ducks.
Out of the 35 AIV-positive samples detected during
the four year study, 34.3% (n = 12) were found in
2003/2004, 5.7% (n = 2) in 2005 and 60% (n = 21) in
2007. 84% of samples in 2007 belonged to Anatidae
(compared to 57% in 2005 and 48% during 2003/2004);
and only in 2007 both oropharyngeal and cloacal samples were collected from each bird. Prevalence of AIV

In total 3% of all sampled birds were AIV positive by
rRT-PCR of M gene (Table 1). Out of 11 bird families
examined, two were positive, Anatidae and Rallidae
(Tables 1 &2). The highest number of AIV (31 out of
35 rRT-PCR positive samples) were detected in dabbling
ducks (genus Anas) including Mallard Anas platyrhynchos (n = 15; 8.3%), Common Teal Anas crecca (n =
9; 2.5%) and Northern Shoveler Anas clypeata (n = 2).
Individual Greylag Goose Anser anser, Garganey Anas
querquedula, Northern Pintail Anas acuta, Common
Pochard Aythya ferina and Tufted Duck Aythya fuligula
also yielded positive results. Out of 45 sampled bird species, eight were positive. In total, Anatidae made up 65%
of the sample volume, and 4.3% of them were AIV positive. Four Common Coots Fulica atra of the Rallidae
family were also AIV positive in this study (1.7%).

was 2.54% in 2003/2004, 1.26% in 2005 and 4.08% in
2007.
Out of 21 AIV-positive samples in 2007 (the year in
which paired sampling from 515 birds was carried out),
nine samples were positive only in the oropharyngeal
swab, eleven samples positive only in the cloacal swab,
and only one bird positive in both oropharyngeal and
cloacal swab samples. The highest number of positive
samples originated from the wetlands south of the

Caspian Sea (n = 25) and in a seasonal wetland in the
south-east of Tehran province (n = 9).
Detection of specific AIV antibodies

The results of serological investigation of 711 serum
samples are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The seroprevalence rates against AIV were 35.5%, 21% and 57.4%
respectively for 2003/2004, 2005 and 2007. However, the
composition of bird species in these four sampling

periods was different. During 2003-2005 only 45.6% of
serum samples belonged to Anatidae, which increased
to 88.5% in 2007. However, the proportion of positive
Anatidae in 2004/2005 and 2007 samples was almost
similar (64% and 61% respectively). Anatidae contributed
a high proportion of positive results: 81 out of 108 Mallard, 157 out of 272 Common Teal, 8 out of 10 Northern Shoveler, 7 out of 10 Common Pochard, 21 out of
28 Northern Pintail, 31 out of 70 Eurasian Wigeon and
2 out of 2 Greylag Goose were antibody-positive. In
total, birds from 17 of 25 species carried antibodies
against AIV (Table 3). A randomly selected batch of 31
cELISA positive and negative serum samples belonging
to different species was tested by Western blotting with
a high correlation between the two tests (data not
shown).
Virus isolation and characterisation

In total, 35 LPAIV were molecularly identified from
1601 oropharyngeal and cloacal samples originating

from 1146 different wild waterbirds wintering/staging in
Iran. No highly pathogenic strains, including H5N1,
were detected in this survey. A total of twelve AIV were
isolated and subtyped mainly during the 2003/2004
investigation; virus isolation for the additional 23 molecularly positive samples (mainly during the 2007 investigation) failed even after 2-3 passages in SPF chicken
eggs (Table 3). HA and/or NA subtypes of 17 samples
from this group were characterized by subtype-specific
RT-PCR, sequencing and microarray (Table 4).
Characterized AIV were categorised into 14 subtypes
using HI, NI, subtype-specific RT-PCR, microarray and
sequencing: H1N1, H3N8, H5N9, H6N2, H7N3, H7N7,
H8N4, H9N2, H10N7, H10N8, H11N1, H11N2, H11N3,
and H11N9. The most common HA subtypes were H9,
H10 and H11, and the most common NA subtypes were
N2, N7 and N1 (Figure 3). Two LPAIV H5 and two
LPAIV H7 strains were identified. One cloacal sample
taken from a Common Teal was positive for two different AIV subtypes: H5N3 (or N9) and H11N9 (or N3).

One H7N3 and one H9N2 isolate (from 2003/2004)
were assessed as LPAIV using IVPI test, as no evidence
of disease or pathogenicity in SPF chickens was
observed (IVPI = 0). Two H5 subtype viruses, from
2007, were considered as LPAIV in RECP assay. Sequencing of the HA cleavage site for the H5 and H7 viruses
confirmed their status as LPAI viruses. The amino acid
patterns of the HA cleavage site for H5 and H7 subtype
viruses were RETR*G and PKGR*G, respectively.
Inter-laboratory real-time PCR results

All 515 samples from 2007 were tested independently by
two AI reference laboratories (FLI tested one set of samples, ISZ-Ve and CIRAD together another set) using
real-time RT-PCR (Tables 1 &3). Results for most of the
samples with moderate and strongly positive results (Ctvalues ≤ 33) were identical, and only 4 weakly positive
samples (33.3 ≤ Ct-values ≤ 35.5) were found positive by
only one laboratory. Positive and negative controls
included in all tests ensured the validity of rRT-PCR
results. We showed that double sampling from the wild
waterbirds is possible and the rRT-PCR results revealed
a very high degree of agreement.
Phylogenetic analyses

In total, nine H9N2 AIV were identified in samples collected during our monitoring studies, and the HA genes
of five of them were sequenced (GenBank: FN600116 FN600119). Due to widespread infection of poultry farms
in Iran with H9N2 subtype virus, phylogenetic analysis
was preferentially carried out on these viruses. A/Garganey/Iran/G8/2003 (H9N2) was isolated from a Garganey
in the southern part of Iran which was suspected to have
been kept together with backyard poultry for a short time
before sampling. The four 2007 H9N2 viruses were identified in a small group of Mallards in the northern part of
Iran, without any known contact with domestic poultry.
The 2003 virus clustered closely with H9N2 viruses isolated in poultry in Iran during 1999-2003, while the 2007
viruses clustered together with wild bird H9N2 viruses
from Russia and Hokkaido (Figure 4).

Discussion
The important role of waterbirds, especially waterfowl,
as a reservoir for avian influenza viruses of all subtypes
is well known from intensive investigations from many
regions of the world [14-17]. Avian influenza monitoring
of wild birds in natural habitats and in areas at risk of
transmission between domestic poultry and wild birds
will increase the knowledge of epidemiology, ecology
and genetic relationships of AIV infections. This knowledge will facilitate risk assessments concerning poultry
and wild bird populations and provides information on
currently circulating AIV which might also have the

Page 10 of 14

potential to become important for human health. However, little information is available about the circulation
of influenza viruses in waterbirds in West and Central
Asia and in the Middle East. This is the first study of
AIV-investigations in wild birds in Iran and this geographic region.
In a survey during 1999-2000 in Northern Europe, 2.6%
of wild ducks and 1.4% of wild geese were positive in
rRT-PCR [18]. In more recent monitoring studies of wild
birds during 2003-2005 in Italy, 5.1% of Anseriformes
were positive in rRT-PCR [19]. Also, in an AIV screening
in 2005 in Norway, 13.2% of Anseriformes were positive
in rRT-PCR [20]. The prevalence of LPAIV in wild birds
in Alaska and Canada seems to be more variable [21-23].
The results from these studies have shown that the prevalence of AIV in wild birds, and especially ducks,
depends on various factors, including geographic altitude
of sampling area, bird species, seasonal parameters and
different sample processing approach. In our investigation, the number of positive birds varied based on species, sampling month and sites. In total 3.4% of all
sampled birds were positive, but different families and
species had different number of positives. Only two out
of 11 investigated families (Anatidae and Rallidae) were
AIV positive, and among 17 sampled species of Anatidae,
8 species revealed positive results. Prevalence rates for
Mallard, Common Teal and Common Coot, with high
sample sizes, were 8.3%, 2.5% and 1.7% respectively
(Table 1). No positive samples were found in shorebirds
(Recurvirostridae, Charadriidae & Scolpacidae).
Previous studies revealed high virus prevalence during
the autumn season in the Northern Hemisphere [16],
whereas the lowest prevalence rates have been measured
in early spring. In contrast, 88% of positive samples in
our study were found during February and early March.
Interestingly, 78% of samples which were collected in
this period came from Anatidae.
The geographical distribution of positive samples
reveals further significant differences. In Mazandaran
(one of the northern provinces), 21 out of 637 samples
tested positive (3.3%), while in a small wetland in the
southeast of Tehran province, 9 out of 135 sampled
birds were positive (6.7%, Table 2). Sample numbers per
species largely reflect the proportion of the wintering
populations in different geographical regions of Iran.
However, with respect to statistical inferences, a bias
regarding different species, seasons and geographical
regions cannot be excluded.
The results of this study regarding the dominant AIV
infected wild bird species are consistent with several
other investigations from Europe and the Americas.
Dabbling ducks were found infected with LPAIV at
higher prevalence rates than other taxonomic groups
[23-25]. Similarly, the highest number of positive AIV

samples has been reported from Mallard and Common
Teal, relative to any other species [20,23]. Mallards are
the most frequently sampled species in most wild birds
surveillance studies in the northern hemisphere, though
in our study Common Teal and Common Coot occupied a higher ranking (Table 1).
No evidence was found for HPAIV H5N1 circulating
in wild birds before (2003-2005) and after introduction
of this virus into wild bird and poultry populations in
countries around the Caspian Sea in 2006. Nevertheless,

the small sample sizes of the species investigated here in
comparison to their total populations make it very hard
to exclude a low or very low prevalence of HPAIV in
wild bird populations. The largest sample sizes in our
study belonged to Common Teal, Common Coot and
Mallard with 358, 233 and 180 birds, respectively.
The results of recent wild bird surveillance in Sweden
indicate that the proportion of positive cloacal samples
exceeds positive oropharyngeal samples [26]. Our results
show a similar proportion of positive oropharyngeal and

Fereidouni et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:43
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/43

cloacal samples. Among 21 positive samples from 2007,
nine were only positive in oropharyngeal swabs, 11 were
only positive in cloacal swabs, and one was positive in
both (Table 3). Only in February 2007 oropharyngeal
and cloacal samples were collected, when nearly half of
the positive samples were retrieved from oropharyngeal
swab samples. In previous years only cloacal swabs had
been taken. This may indicate that the number of
LPAIV positive birds may be significantly underestimated when relying exclusively on cloacal samples. In
addition, it cannot be excluded that different AIV subtypes may exhibit different tissue tropism. For example,
out of five H11 subtype viruses detected during 2007,
four originated from cloacal samples.
The real-time RT-PCR results of inter-laboratory analyses of 2007 samples were highly concordant, when two
identical sets of the samples were tested by laboratories
in Germany and France/Italy. This finding shows the
robustness of results when using the standard protocols
in different laboratories. In addition, it shows sampling
of cloaca or oropharyngeal area of the same bird twice,
does not cause false negative results of the second
sample.
The potentially higher sensitivity of rRT-PCR compared to virus isolation has been mentioned before in
other investigations [18]. Although some investigators
could demonstrate that avian viruses originating from
wild bird samples require several passages in embryonated eggs for adaptation, our investigation during
2003-2005 showed acceptable results even in the first
egg passage (Table 3). During the 2007 investigation,
only two out of 21 positive samples were also positive in
virus isolation. The efficacy of virus isolation was dramatically reduced compared to 2003-2005. This might
be due to many factors including: improper sample
transfer in 2007 with extended international transport
and interruption of the cold chain, quality and preservation of VTM and viral load of the samples.
Validation of a serological assay for detection of AIVspecific antibodies in wild birds is still a matter of
debate [15,18,27-32]. Only limited information is available about the sensitivity of the HI assay in these species. In a recent study [33], only 16.9% of wild duck sera
which tested positive in a double antibody sandwich
blocking ELISA were positive in HI assay. Previous studies showed that competitive ELISAs on the basis of
recombinant AIV-NP antigen appear to be a valid and
reliable method for testing different bird species for
avian influenza infection [15,32,34].
In this study, the overall sero-prevalence based on 711
serum samples from different species was 48.5%, and
Anseriformes provided 61.45% positive c-ELISA results.
Therefore, the overall sero-prevalence could be misleading due to the species composition of samples. Two

Page 12 of 14

duck species with high numbers of samples were Mallards with 75% positive of 108, and Common Teal with
57.7% positive of 272 tested birds. These results,
together with the virological data, again emphasize the
importance of these species for the epidemiology of AIV
in the nature, but the high percentage of AIV positive
Mallard and Common Teal may just reflect an overrepresentation of these species in the sample composition due to their large wintering population in Iran.
Thus, although the sample size for other members of
this order was small, the detected prevalence rates are
impressive (Table 3). Interestingly, only one serum sample from 66 Common Coots sampled during 2003-2005
was weakly seropositive, whereas sixteen from 49 Common Coot samples collected in 2007 were seropositive
(32%). In addition, in 2003-2005 we could not find any
AIV positive samples from 117 Common Coots taken
from six different provinces [35], whereas in 2007 three
out of 77 samples from Common Coots were positive in
rRT-PCR. The relevance of these findings is not clear.
Although seropositive samples were found among only
12% of Non-Anseriformes in 5 different families, some
species, such as Greater Flamingo (3/3 positive) and
Black-headed Gull (4/10 positive), demonstrated high
prevalence rates.

Conclusions
In summary, the results of these investigations provide
important information about the prevalence of LPAIV
in wild birds in Iran, especially wetlands around the
Caspian Sea which represent an important wintering site
for migratory water birds. In addition, it could be shown
that both oropharyngeal and cloacal swab samples contribute to the detection of positive birds, and neither
should be neglected. Proper sample handling and maintenance of cold chains are important to ensure sample
quality which is essential at least for virus isolation.
Results obtained by rRT-PCR are less dependent on
sample quality as shown by higher number of positives
and by the high degree of correlation of results from different laboratories. The obvious problems with virus isolation highlight the ongoing demand of molecular
methods for the sensitive detection and characterization
of AIV.
