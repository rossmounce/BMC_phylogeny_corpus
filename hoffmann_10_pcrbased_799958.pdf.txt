intergenic spacer regions among Vibrio species

Abstract
Background: The genus Vibrio is a diverse group of Gram-negative bacteria comprised of 74 species. Furthermore,
the genus has and is expected to continue expanding with the addition of several new species annually.
Consequently, it is of paramount importance to have a method which is able to reliably and efficiently differentiate
the numerous Vibrio species.
Results: In this study, a novel and rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based intergenic spacer (IGS)-typing
system for vibrios was developed that is based on the well-known IGS regions located between the 16S and 23S
rRNA genes on the bacterial chromosome. The system was optimized to resolve heteroduplex formation as well as
to take advantage of capillary gel electrophoresis technology such that reproducible analyses could be achieved in
a rapid manner. System validation was achieved through testing of 69 archetypal Vibrio strains, representing 48
Vibrio species, from which an ‘IGS-type’ profile database was generated. These data, presented here in several
cluster analyses, demonstrated successful differentiation of the 69 type strains showing that this PCR-based
fingerprinting method easily discriminates bacterial strains at the species level among Vibrio. Furthermore, testing
36 strains each of V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus, important food borne pathogens, isolated from a variety of
geographical locations with the IGS-typing method demonstrated distinct IGS-typing patterns indicative of
subspecies divergence in both populations making this technique equally useful for intraspecies differentiation, as
well.
Conclusion: This rapid, reliable and efficient IGS-typing system, especially in combination with 16S rRNA gene
sequencing, has the capacity to not only discern and identify vibrios at the species level but, in some cases, at the
sub-species level, as well. This procedure is particularly well-suited for preliminary species identification and, lends
itself nicely to epidemiological investigations providing information more quickly than other time-honoured
methods traditionally used in these types of analyses.

Background
Vibrio infections are becoming more and more common
worldwide. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 8,028 Vibrio
infections and 57 deaths occur annually in the United
States. Of these infections, 5,218 are foodborne in origin
[1]. Three major syndromes, gastroenteritis, wound
infection, and septicema, are caused by pathogenic
vibrios. Within the genus Vibrio, V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus have long been established as important human pathogens in various parts of

the world. Generally, these organisms are contracted
after the patient has consumed raw or undercooked seafood, such as oysters, shrimp, and fish [2]. Hence, identification and subtyping of Vibrio isolates are of
significant importance to public health and the safety of
the human food supply.
In the last several years, an explosion of taxonomic
studies have defined and redefined the members of the
genus Vibrio. In 2004, Thompson et al. [2] introduced a
classification strategy for vibrios that recommended,
based on concatenated 16S rRNA gene sequencing,
recA, and rpoA gene sequences, that the family Vibrionaceae be separated into four new families, Vibrionaceae, Salinivibrionaceae, Photobacteriaceae and
Enterovibrionaceae. The new family Vibrionaceae is

comprised solely of the genus Vibrio, which at that time
consisted of 63 distinct species. To date, the genus
Vibrio has expanded to include a total of 74 distinct
species http://www.vibriobiology.net/ with several new
Vibrio species being identified in the last four years
[3-6]. As it likely that this trend will continue, it
becomes increasingly important to have simple yet accurate identification systems capable of differentiating all
Vibrio species.
An array of phenotypic and genomic techniques has
become available for the identification of vibrios. Biochemical characteristics have been used to identify
Vibrio species. However, Vibrio and other closely related
species show similar phenotypic features and, subsequently, are not easily distinguished biochemically [7].
Studies in the past have shown that identification systems based on molecular genetic techniques, such as
16S rRNA gene sequencing, 16S-23S rRNA IGS regions,
amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and
multilocus sequence analyses (MLSA), are more discriminating than phenotypic methods and often provide
more accurate taxonomic information about a particular
strain [8-11]. Several investigators have used 16S rRNA
gene sequences to study overall phylogenetic relationships of the Vibrionaceae [10,12,13]. However, within
the genus Vibrio, many different species contain nearly
identical 16S rRNA gene sequences rendering this
method less reliable. Furthermore, as the number of
known Vibrio species continues to rise, it becomes even
more likely that sequence variation in the 16S rRNA
gene will no longer be sufficient alone as a target for
differentiation of closely related Vibrio species or subgroups within the same species [2]. Given the apparent
short-comings of 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses for
determining taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships
of vibrios, an increasing premium is placed on the
design, optimization, and deployment of subtyping
schemes capable of more robust differentiation of
vibrios. For bacteria with more than one rRNA operon,
characterization of the 16S-23S rRNA IGS regions has
been used successfully for subtyping closely related species. Due to variability in size and sequence of multiple
IGS segments, size separation of PCR products spanning
the IGS can enable effective differentiation of Vibrio
species [14,15].
Previous studies using IGS fingerprinting have
encountered several problems. Foremost is the formation of heteroduplex DNA artifacts (i.e., double-stranded
DNA molecules comprised of individual strands arising
from two separate PCR products that share significant
homology such that annealing occurs) that make interpretation of results difficult and often intangible [16-19].
Furthermore, the earlier studies often relied on either
agarose or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)

for resolution of amplicons, making the procedure a
timely process, as well [20]. In this study, we present a
novel PCR-based protocol that utilizes the IGS locus
along with custom-designed, Vibrio-specific 16S and 23S
rRNA gene PCR primers for the discrimination of Vibrio
species. This improved system successfully eliminated
the heteroduplexes frequently encountered in other
IGS-typing protocols. Moreover, the system takes advantage of capillary gel electrophoresis technology for
amplicon resolution in a more rapid and accurate manner than traditional gel electrophoresis-based
approaches. An analysis of 69 Vibrio type strains
demonstrated that the procedure reliably differentiates
at the species level, allowing the generation of an IGStype pattern database that could be used for subsequent
identification of unknown Vibrio isolates. Finally, analysis of a collection of V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus strains isolated from a variety of distinct
geographical locales demonstrated intra-species IGS heterogeneity indicating that this protocol not only reliably
differentiates at the species level but also at the subspecies level to some extent. Collectively, this report presents a Vibrio typing system that is versatile not only in
identification of unknown isolates but also for epidemiological investigations, as well.

Results
The study began by confirming that the 69 Vibrio type
strains obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) and the Belgian Co-Ordinated Collection of
Micro Organisms (BCCM) used in this study were correctly identified. The 16S rRNA gene sequence from
each strain was successfully amplified and sequenced
using eight additional sequencing primers. After contig
assembly, BLAST (basic local alignment search tool)
analysis of each product confirmed the actual identification of every type strain used in this study.
Optimization and efficacy of the IGS-typing protocol

Following identity confirmation, strains were subjected
to the IGS-typing procedure designed in this study.
Using the optimized PCR protocol, IGS amplicons were
successfully generated from all Vibrio strains. These
products were resolved using the Agilent BioAnalyzer
2100 capillary gel electrophoresis system. The system
effectively separated the products, however, artifacts
emerged that were not consistent with the products that
should have been generated, as determined from nucleotide sequences available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. Presumably,
these artifacts were a consequence of heteroduplex formation, a problem frequently associated with this type
of analysis [16,19]. To circumvent this problem, a brief
second-round amplification step was introduced that

Figure 1 This figure shows the successful elimination of heteroduplex artifacts following secondary PCR process. Lanes one, three and

the one extra PCR amplification step. Lanes 1-2, V. cholerae ATCC 25874; lanes 3-4, V. vulnificus ATCC 43382; Lanes 5-6, V. parahaemolyticus ATCC

easily eliminated artifacts to produce crisp and resolute
data patterns with the Agilent system (Figure 1). Analysis using BioNumerics yielded an unweight pair group
method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) dendrogram
that demonstrated that the patterns generated were sufficiently different from one another so that all species
could be separated by virtue of their own unique “species-specific” IGS-type patterns (Figure 2). Furthermore,
these data buttress the notion that such a method focusing on the variable IGS regions of Vibrio species can be
used to rapidly identify and distinguish individual species of important Vibrio pathogens.

Having demonstrated the efficiency of this method,
the next step was to evaluate its fidelity. To this end,
DNA was isolated from V. cholerae ATCC 25874, V.
vulnificus ATCC 43382 and V. parahaemolyticus ATCC
17802 four separate times and individually processed
(i.e., four individual biological replicates were produced).
The cleaned PCR products from each of these replicates
were analyzed simultaneously on the Bioanalyzer 2100.
The resulting electropherograms and gel images generated by the Bioanalyzer 2100 revealed that all DNA templates derived from the same strain reproducibly yield
the same IGS-type patterns (Figure 3). Furthermore,

Figure 2 BioNumerics-derived UPGMA Dendrogram generated from the results of the IGS-typing procedure using 69 Vibrio reference
strains. It is shown that all different species could be separated by virtue of their own unique ‘specific-specific’ IGS-type patterns. Parameters
used to produce the dendrogram were: Dice (Opt:1.00%) (Tol 0.25-0.25%) (H>0.0% S>0.0%) [0.0%-100.0%].

having found that these four species consistently yielded
the same IGS-type patterns, the Vibrio type strains originally tested were subjected to an additional round of
testing to assure that those patterns originally observed
for the type strains were also consistently reproduced.
As expected, the second round of testing yielded patterns identical to those originally observed. Clearly,

based on these data, the method is both efficient and
reliable.
Differentiation of type strains by IGS-typing analysis

The 69 archetypal Vibrio strains used in this study
represented 48 distinct species. In the course of evaluating these strains, it was noted in several cases that

700601 and ATCC 14546 differed by only two base
pairs in 16S rRNA gene structure but also demonstrated
distinctly different IGS-patterns (Figure 2). However,
these latter IGS-typic differences were not entirely unexpected, as several phenotypic differences between the
isolates were also noted. For instance, ATCC 14546
demonstrated a phosphorescent phenotype on Photobacterium Agar (Sigma-Aldrich Laboratories, St. Louis,
MO, USA) not noted by the ATCC 700601 strain. As
with the V. natriegens and V. fischeri strains, V. cholerae
strains ATCC 14541, ATCC 11629 and ATCC 25847
also shared identical 16S rRNA gene sequence homogeneity yet produced IGS-patterns that separated the
strain ATCC 14541 away from the other two strains
(ATCC 11629 and ATCC 25847). This might reflect the
fact that ATCC 14541 was originally deposited with
ATCC as V. albensis and later, erroneously, reclassified
as V. cholera as a consequence of 16S rRNA gene
sequence composition.
Evidence of intra-species divergence by IGS-typing
analysis

replicate analyses. DNA was isolated from each strain four
separate times and individually processed and evaluated for
consistency in banding pattern. Lanes 1-3, replicate 1; Lanes 4-6,
replicate 2; Lanes 7-9, replicate 3 and Lanes 10-12, replicate 4. Lanes

distinctly different IGS-patterns were obtained from the
same species having homogenous 16S rRNA gene structure. For instance, V. natriegens ATCC 33898 differed
by only a single base pair in 16S rRNA gene sequence
structure from V. natriegens strains ATCC 14048 and
LMG 10935 yet produced an IGS-pattern distinctly different than that observed for either ATCC 14048 or
LMG 10935, both of which yielded identical IGS fingerprints (Figure 2). Similarly, V. fischeri strains ATCC

To further explore the extent of this intra-species divergence phenomenon, 36 strains of V. parahaemolyticus
and V. vulnificus, obtained from various geographical
locations, were evaluated by this IGS-typing method.
Interestingly, a significant degree of heterogeneity in the
IGS-pattern obtained from the V. parahaemolyticus isolates was observed, where the UPGMA analysis separated the V. parahaemolyticus strains into five distinct
clusters (Figure 4). These clusters were more clearly
observed in a 3D multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis (Figure 5). In this view, distinct genetic partitions
were noted, separated by substantial divergence among
IGS-type patterns.
Similarly, although, to a lesser extent, the V. vulnificus
strains demonstrated IGS-pattern heterogeneity that
UPGMA analysis partitioned into four distinct clusters
(Figure 5 and 6). Two of these four clusters were comprised of one strain, each signaling rare and unique genotypes for these patterns. Based on the limited
population examined, it is notable that the four clusters
can be easily distinguished since the IGS-types are substantially diverged and largely unique both in band composition and in major size shifts. A good example is
pattern cluster one, which retains a band uniquely missing in pattern four (Figure 6).

Discussion
The Vibrio genus is a complex group of marine-associated bacteria currently comprised of 74 species. The
genus appears to be poised for continued growth as
novel species are added regularly http://www.vibriobiology.net/. Consequently, this study was undertaken to

develop a means by which these species could be efficiently, reliably, and accurately identified and differentiated. To date, analyses of IGS located between the
16S-23S rRNA gene loci have drawn considerable attention as one such means to accomplish this particular
goal. Unfortunately, these analyses tend to be more
laborious (i.e., restriction endonuclease analysis followed

by probe-based detection) requiring a considerable time
commitment. Moreover, many of these protocols generate extraneous artifacts that make interpretation of
results often times difficult and unreliable.
To date, the most commonly used primers for the
amplification of the IGS have been those described by
Jensen et al. [21]. The 16S rRNA gene primer (G1) was

generated for a highly conserved region of the 16S
rRNA gene locus approximately 30-40 bp upstream of
the IGS using the 16S rRNA gene sequence data generated by Dams et al [22] from a broad range of bacterial
and eukaryotic genera (107 species). In contrast, as the
23S rRNA gene sequence is much less conserved than
that of the 16S rRNA gene, the 23S primer (L1) was
designed from the 23S rRNA gene sequences of only
five bacterial and four plant species previously determined by Gutell et al [23]. As these primers were not
based solely on Vibrio 16S and 23S rRNA gene
sequences, a new set of Vibrio-specific primers was
designed from an alignment of 16S and 23S Vibrio
rRNA gene sequences. PCR reactions were optimized
using these primers such that the amplification products
from four reference strains (V. parahaemolyticus
BAA239 (O3:K6), V. cholerae ATCC 25874, V. vulnificus
ATCC 43382 and V. fischeri ATCC 700601) were consistent with the number and sizes of those that could be
theoretically derived from genomic sequences available
at the NCBI database (V. parahaemolyticus RIMD
2210633 (Chromosome I: NC_004603; chromosome II:
NC_004605), V. cholerae O395 (chromosome 1:
NC_009456; chromosome 2: NC_009457), V. vulnificus
CMCP6 (chromosome 1: NC_004459; chromosome 2:
NC_004460) and V. fischeri ES 114 (chromosome 1:
NC_006840; chromosome 2: NC_006841)). As an example, the chromosome coordinates, relative size, and
number of IGS regions targeted by this assay for V.
parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus, and V. cholerae are

depicted in Figure 7. In every case, IGS banding patterns
correlated perfectly with expected fragment size (compare Figure 7 to Figures 1 and 3). Afterwards, the testing of each remaining reference species demonstrated
unique banding patterns for all strains included. In the
course of the optimization procedure, artifacts, the likely
result of heteroduplex formation, were universally noted
in the reaction products derived from these species.
While several means by which heteroduplex formation
could be eliminated or reduced are discussed in numerous publications [16,18,19], we found that only one [24],
with some modification, produced results acceptable for
use in this particular protocol. Subsequently, PCR products derived from the first amplification procedure
were processed further with a second round of PCR
optimized for heteroduplex elimination. Numerous testing of the two-round PCR procedure repeatedly yielded
products devoid of transient artifacts, confirming that
the process was suitable for and highly compatible with
this type of analysis.
Previous IGS studies have relied on either agarose or
PAGE for resolution of the amplicons generated by
PCR-based IGS-typic analyses [14,25]. These methods
can be somewhat cumbersome and require a lengthy
amount of time to perform. To overcome this limitation,
this protocol was engineered to take advantage of the
rapid and sensitive capillary gel electrophoresis technology. Using the Agilent BioAnalyzer 2100 system, it was
determined that a minimal amount of effort to more
thoroughly clean the second round PCR products

Figure 6 BioNumerics-derived UPGMA dendrogram obtained following the IGS-typing of the 36 V. vulnificus strains. The UPGMA
analysis separated the V. vulnificus strains into four distinct clusters. Parameters used to produce the dendrogram were: Dice. (Opt:1.00%) (Tol

allowed this technology to deliver results that were at
least as good as, if not better than, those obtained from
traditional electrophoresis protocols. Furthermore, the
Agilent system provided the additional benefit of a
highly accurate and easily interpreted virtual gel-based
result. That is, band interpretations were based on real
genotypic differences defined by obvious deviations in
band size, rather than subjective band ‘bin’ assignments
so often incorporated with conventional agarose and
PAGE.

While all reference species tested produced results
that sufficiently differentiated them, as noted by the
cluster analyses, we also determined, in a few cases,
identical species having homogenous 16S rRNA gene
sequence structure produced different IGS-type banding
patterns. These patterns were often times substantially
different such that identical species were separated
widely on the resultant dendrograms. One explanation
for this observation is that horizontal gene transfer
(HGT) has occurred in the IGS of one isolate causing a

Figure 7 Schematic depicting the relative size (bp), order, and chromosome position of 16S-23S rRNA IGS regions of 3 Vibrio species.
This figure shows the relevant genomic regions of V. parahaemolyticus RIMD 2210633 (Chromosome I: NC_004603; chromosome II: NC_004605),
V. cholerae O395 (chromosome 1: NC_009456; chromosome 2: NC_009457) and V. vulnificus CMCP6 (chromosome 1: NC_004459; chromosome
2: NC_004460). Sequence coordinates denoting 16S-23S rRNA IGS primer binding sites are listed above and below their respective locus and
correspond to the NCBI genome accessions provided here. IGS regions are denoted by open boxes with sizes (in bp) provided within.
Directional orientation is indicated for both chromosomes by the 0 min start (0’) to the left of each map.

deviation in its specific IGS-typic pattern. Additionally,
as might be the case for the V. fischeri isolates that have
identical 16S rRNA gene structure and, presumably, are
the same species, when, in fact, they are not. In this particular case, one of the isolates displayed a phosphorescent phenotype while the other did not. Similarly, V.
cholerae isolates demonstrated that all had identical 16S
rRNA gene sequence structures yet only two of the isolates produced identical IGS-prints. The third V. cholerae ATCC 14541 produced a distinctly different
banding pattern. Of particular interest is that this ‘atypical’ V. cholerae strain was originally deposited as V.
albensis, not V. cholerae, underscoring the risks associated with speciating strains based solely on their 16S
rRNA gene structure.
To explore intraspecies level IGS-typic divergence for
several important Vibrio species, a comprehensive study
characterizing the IGS-typic relationship within a population of 36 V. parahaemolyticus and 36 V. vulnificus
isolates derived from different geographic locations was
performed. As expected, these strains confirmed

divergence of IGS-type patterns at the intraspecies level.
Surprisingly, 15 different V. parahaemolyticus IGS-types,
consisting of up to seven bands each, partitioned readily
into five distinct clusters. This particular observation
deviated significantly from an earlier study [26] proposing that V. parahaemolyticus was segregated into four
clusters based solely on the four distinct IGS-patterns
that were observed in their PAGE analysis. This significant difference in segregative ability allows a more
powerful and discriminatory resolution of strains at the
intraspecies level. Furthermore, the previous study [26],
suggests that mismatches in the L1 (Jensen) primer [21]
gave rise to a different and, presumably, an incorrect
banding pattern from that generated when using their
own primer set, although the L1/G1 pattern they present in their representation is clearly in agreement with
the pattern that would be theoretically obtained from
the NCBI genomic sequence of the V. parahaemolyticus
RIMD 2210683 strain. Interestingly, the L1/G1 pattern
presented in the earlier Jensen et al. study is entirely
consistent with that of our own work, which is not

Hoffmann et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:90
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/90

entirely surprising as the sequence of L1 (and G1) are
100% complementary to the annealing sites of all 11
V. parahaemolyticus RIMD 2210683 rDNA loci.
We found in preliminary investigations of V. vulnificus
that, although not to the degree of V. parahaemolyticus,
the IGS-typing data also consisted of numerous (~10)
unique patterns that partitioned nicely into four distinct
clusters. Moreover, several of these isolates produced
IGS-prints that consisted of five to six bands, significantly deviating from the pattern produced by our reference strains (V. vulnificus ATCC 43382, ATCC 29307
and ATCC 29306), as well as the theoretical pattern
derived from the NCBI genomic sequence submission
for V. vulnificus CMCP6 (NC_004459 and NC_004460),
all of which consisted of a four band IGS-type pattern.
These data may signal a reticulate evolutionary pattern
for IGS sequences in this group of vibrios.
Notably, we found that the IGS-typing data derived
from the V. parahaemolyticus study correlated nicely
with the distributions of MLST sequence types (STs)
previously generated for these strains, with no single ST
observed in more than one cluster [27]. This finding
was also noted in the V. vulnificus analysis [28]. For
example, strains having ST16 converged into ribotype
cluster one. Additionally in the case of V. parahaemolyticus, it is interesting to note that clusters two, three,
four and five were primarily comprised of United Statesderived isolates, indicating some degree of phylogeographic concordance with resultant IGS-prints (Figure
4). Taken together these observations suggest that it
may, indeed, be possible to engage in epidemiological
studies of outbreak strains using IGS-typing methodology. Furthermore, understanding and characterizing the
relationship of these outbreak strains to their environmental counterparts might also be facilitated using this
analytical strategy.
At present, it appears that, in complex genera consisting of numerous species, identification by monotypic
analysis becomes increasingly more difficult and unreliable [2]. Clearly, this is the case for 16S rRNA gene
sequence analysis of Vibrio strains, where unique and
distinct species retain virtually identical 16S rRNA gene
sequences, differing by as little as two to three (≥ 0.2%)
base pairs. However, we have shown that it may be possible to discriminate at the species and intra-species
levels using an analysis of IGS regions that is easy to
perform, avoids cumbersome and time-consuming
PAGE and agarose gel electrophoresis technologies and
is devoid of the interfering artifacts that make accurate
interpretation of results difficult at best. Moreover, this
strategy incorporates a conservative analytical approach
where only substantial, non-ambiguous results are considered in the interpretation of the analysis. In combination with a 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, the

Page 10 of 14

approach becomes even more powerful in the identification of species and, consequently, should prove invaluable for differentiation of species within a very complex
Vibrio genus and for characterization of outbreak strains
and isolates found in suspect environmental/food
samples.

Conclusion
This report describes a method that discriminates Vibrio
species in a rapid and accurate manner. PCR amplification products derived from the 16S-23S rRNA genes
IGS region could be analyzed using capillary gel electrophoresis technology to generate an IGS-typing pattern
for each strain tested. The study showed that each of
the species produced an IGS-typing pattern unique to
itself that could be used to identify Vibrio species.
Furthermore, the analysis could be performed more
rapidly with the capillary gel electrophoresis procedure
than either traditional agarose or PAGE protocols. The
study also shows that there is sufficient intra-species
IGS-typing pattern variation that differentiates at the
subspecies, as well, especially when used in combination
with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. As such, the procedure
described in this report could be successfully used in
preliminary epidemiological investigations, as well as
other studies, to yield information more rapidly than
other established subtyping methods requiring a considerably greater time commitment, such as pulsed field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE), AFLP or MLSA.
Methods
Bacterial Strains, Growth Condition and Characterization

The 69 Vibrio type strains listed in Table 1 represented
48 species that served as reference taxa for this study.
Isolates were obtained from ATCC and BCCM. Freezedried (lyophilized) cultures were revived according to
protocols provided by the ATCC and BCCM curators.
16S rRNA gene sequencing (Amplicon Express, Pullman, WA, USA) was used as confirmation in assuring
the identity of reference strains.
Thirty six V. parahaemolyticus and 36 V. vulnificus
strains from various laboratories within the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) were also selected for this
study. These strains, listed in Table 2, were very well
characterized at the FDA (Dauphin Island AL) [20,27].
The strains were grown overnight with shaking (112
rpm) in Luria Bertani (LB; DIFCO Laboratories) medium at 37°C. Thiosulfate-Citrate-Bile Salts-Sucrose
(TCBS; DIFCO Laboratories) Agar was used also as a
selective agar to differentiate V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus strains. Further confirmation of strain
identity based on biochemical identification was performed using the standardized API 20 E identification
system (bioMérieux, L’Etoile, France) and the PathotecR

Oligonucleotide primers for amplification of the 16S
rRNA gene and subsequent sequencing were designed
using conserved sequences detected within a Clustal X
nucleotide alignment of the Vibrio 16S nucleotide
sequences obtained from the NCBI database. 16S rRNA
gene sequences from 15 separate Vibrio species were
used for the sequence alignment. Derived primer
sequences were evaluated for predicted efficiency using
the NetPrimer computer software (Premier Biosoft
International, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The primers used
for PCR amplification were: 16SF [5’-GTTTGATCATGGCTCAGATTG-3’] and 16SR [5’-CTACCTTGTTACGACTTCACC-3’].
The PCR was performed in a 50 μl volume with HotStarTaq Master Mix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) containing 400 μM dNTP (each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and
dTTP), 5 U of HotStart Taq Polymerase (Qiagen), 1x
Taq polymerase buffer (Qiagen), 2.5 mM MgCl2 and a
300 nM concentration of each primer with ~100 ng of
DNA template. The optimized amplification program
began with a 95°C for 15 min enzyme activation step.
To minimize PCR products derived from mispriming
events, the actual amplification was initiated with a
‘touchdown’ PCR step consisting of 10 cycles at 95°C for
30 second (sec), 72°C-63°C (decreasing 1°C/cycle) for 20
sec and 72°C for 1.00 min followed by 35 cycles of 95°C
for 30 sec, 63°C for 20 sec and 72°C for 1.00 min. The
process was finished with a single cycle at 72°C for
2 min and stored at 4°C until analyzed.
Both strands of amplified PCR products were
sequenced by Amplicon Express (Pullman, WA, USA)
using Big Dye chemistry with 4 forward and 4 reverse
target-specific sequencing primers (Table 3) in an ABI
3730 XL DNA sequencer according to the manufacturer’s directions. DNA sequences were edited and
assembled using DNAStar, Inc. (Madison, WI) Lasergene SeqMan II 5.07 sequence analyses software. After
analyzing and assembling the respective sequences, a
consensus sequence was used to query the NCBI
BLAST database at NCBI to reconfirm reference strain
identity.

template. The amplification program was 95°C for 15
min, 10 cycles at 95°C for 30 sec., 73°C-64°C (decreasing
1°C/cycle) for 10 sec and 72°C for 45 sec. Afterwards,
complete amplification was achieved with 34 cycles of
95°C for 30 sec, 64°C for 10 sec and 72°C for 45 sec.
The process was finished with a single cycle at 72°C for
1 min and stored at 4°C.
Heteroduplex formation was resolved with an additional amplification cycle [24] where the initial PCR products were diluted 1:5 in a 30 μl volume and subjected
to a single amplification cycle of 95°C for 15.00 min, 64°C
for 1.00 min and 72°C for 10.00 min in a similar reaction
mixture containing 600 nM primer concentration. Afterwards, the PCR products were purified using QIAquick
PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and eluted into 10 μL of nuclease-free
Water.
Analysis of IGS-typing fingerprints

IGS PCR amplicons were resolved by capillary gel electrophoresis using the Agilent BioAnalyzer 2100 and the
Agilent DNA 7500 Assay Protocol (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). Using the BioAnalyzer
2100 integrated computer software, electropherograms
and gel patterns were generated depicting the resulting
PCR products derived from the IGS-typing reaction.
Faint bands comprising less than 5% of the total DNA
concentration and measuring less than 1 ng/ul were discarded prior to performing the analysis using BioNumerics fingerprinting software 5.10 (Applied
Mathematics, Sint Martens Latem, Belgium). BioAnalyzer data was imported directly into the BioNumerics
software using a custom script written by Applied Math
for the BioNumerics software. The BioNumerics software used the Dice similarity coefficient to generate the
UPGMA dendrograms presented in this study with Dice
parameters: Optimization (Opt): 1.00%, Tolerance (Tol).
0.25% - 0.25% for the reference strains, and Opt: 1.00%,
Tol. 0.55% - 0.55% for the 36 V. vulnificus and 36 V.
parahaemolyticus strains.
