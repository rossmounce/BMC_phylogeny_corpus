Abstract
Background: We have recently discovered that the two tryptophans of human b2-microglobulin have distinctive
roles within the structure and function of the protein. Deeply buried in the core, Trp95 is essential for folding
stability, whereas Trp60, which is solvent-exposed, plays a crucial role in promoting the binding of b2microglobulin to the heavy chain of the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHCI). We have previously
shown that the thermodynamic disadvantage of having Trp60 exposed on the surface is counter-balanced by the
perfect fit between it and a cavity within the MHCI heavy chain that contributes significantly to the functional
stabilization of the MHCI. Therefore, based on the peculiar differences of the two tryptophans, we have analysed
the evolution of b2-microglobulin with respect to these residues.
Results: Having defined the b2-microglobulin protein family, we performed multiple sequence alignments and
analysed the residue conservation in homologous proteins to generate a phylogenetic tree. Our results indicate
that Trp60 is highly conserved, whereas some species have a Leu in position 95; the replacement of Trp95 with
Leu destabilizes b2-microglobulin by 1 kcal/mol and accelerates the kinetics of unfolding. Both thermodynamic
and kinetic data fit with the crystallographic structure of the Trp95Leu variant, which shows how the hydrophobic
cavity of the wild-type protein is completely occupied by Trp95, but is only half filled by Leu95.
Conclusions: We have established that the functional Trp60 has been present within the sequence of b2microglobulin since the evolutionary appearance of proteins responsible for acquired immunity, whereas the
structural Trp95 was selected and stabilized, most likely, for its capacity to fully occupy an internal cavity of the
protein thereby creating a better stabilization of its folded state.

Background
Over the past few years, the investigation of b2-microglobulin (b2-m) amyloidogenesis has shed light on the pathogenesis of Dialysis Related Amyloidosis (DRA) [1] and has
provided general information on the mechanism of structural transition of globular proteins into amyloid fibrils
[2-4]. Single amino acid substitutions in the protein

sequence enabled us to demonstrate the pivotal role of the
two tryptophan (Trp) residues in the function and amyloidogenic propensity of this protein. Moreover, we have
recently discovered a functional role of Trp60 in promoting the intermolecular association of b2-m with the MHCI
heavy chain and in enhancing the conformational flexibility of the loop between strands D-E and the N-terminal
stretch [5]. This conformational flexibility involving Trp60
is necessary for the optimal binding of b2-m to the MHCI
heavy chain, although, at the same time, this increases the
intrinsic tendency of the protein to self aggregate.

In contrast, Trp95 is buried in the hydrophobic core
of the protein and is apparently essential for its stability;
however Trp95 does not contribute directly to the binding of the MHCI heavy chain. Tryptophan is a relatively
rare amino acid within a protein sequence and its large
hydrophobic surface area containing the heterocyclic
ring system has a unique role in protein folding and
function [6]. These two properties drive protein remodelling during evolution wherein a trade-off exists
between mutations that endow better protein function
regardless of protein fitness and compensatory mutations that improve stability [7]. The two Trp residues of
b2-m represent two examples of how this amino acid
can affect protein structure or function; therefore, we
analysed the evolutionary tree and the conservation of
the two residues in vertebrates expressing MHCI molecules. We have discovered that Trp60 is highly conserved, whereas, in some of the most basal taxa, Leu is
present in position 95. To understand the possible positive effects of the replacement of Leu95 with Trp we
investigated the structural impact of this mutation on
human b2-m.

Results and Discussion
Conservation and phylogenetic analysis

We used the FamFetch tool with the entry name
B2MG_HUMAN to search the HOVERGEN database.
The retrieved family, HBG006197, consisted of 130 protein sequences from 96 different species with Gnathostomata as a common ancestor. We selected a single
sequence for each species and the CLUSTALW algorithm was used to align the resulting 96 proteins (Figure
1). A simple conservation analysis of the amino acids
based on this multiple alignment allowed us to compute
conservation, quality and consensus annotation for a
specific region (Figure 2). In the multiple alignment,
Trp60 and Trp95 of mature b2-m are located at positions 96 and 137, respectively, and both show a consensus over 90% (97% and 94%, respectively). This
observation represents the first evidence of the relevance
of the two amino acids. However, the conservation and
the quality annotation show that the chemistry and the
quality of the conservation is high for Trp60 (10 and
203.034, respectively), but quite low for Trp95 (7 and
173.665) suggesting a high probability of mutation for
Trp95. As described previously, while Trp60 is solventexposed and essential for promoting intermolecular
association, Trp95 is buried in the hydrophobic cavity of
the protein delimited by residues Ser11, Asn21, Leu23,
Phe70, Pro72 and Tyr78. This analysis shows that all
these amino acids have a high percentage of consensus,
as well as high values of conservation and quality annotation: Ser11 (position 42): 91%, 9, 208.772; Asn21 (position 53): 98%, 10, 209.680; Leu23 (position 55): 95%, 10,

214.541; Phe70 (position 106): 95%, 10, 205.723; Pro72
(position 109): 98%, 10, 215.842; Tyr78 (position 117):
89%, 9, 194.226.
The phylogenetic tree was constructed using four different methods: Neighbor-Joining (NJ), Maximal Parsimony (MP), Minimum Evolution (ME) and Bayesian
Inference (BI). The taxonomy of the organisms was considered as a species tree (Figure 3) with Triakis scyllium
and Raja eglanteria as the most basal, both belonging to
Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes), which was also the
most divergent class. The distinction between those two
species can only be based on the fossil records of the
corresponding genus; in fact the Triakis genus is dated
from the Palaeocene 65.5-55.8 Ma (million years ago),
whereas the Raja genus is from the Maastrichtian (70.665.5 Ma). For this reason, we selected Raja eglanteria as
a unique and the most basal taxon. Therefore, we rerooted the gene trees by selecting as root the Raja
eglanteria protein, B2MG_RAJEG. Moreover, the
sequence from Triakis scyllium has limited similarity
with all the other family members, so the alignment and
the subsequent conclusions on the conservation would
have limited reliability. It is worth noting that the most
basal species, in which b2-m is present, belong to cartilaginous fishes; therefore, we can approximately date the
appearance of the protein at about 500 Ma (455 Ma for
the fossil record and 528 for molecular time, estimation
based on a large scale multiple genes alignment) [8].
Therefore, we can assume that the appearance of b2-m
in vertebrates is coincident with the appearance of adaptive immunity and the expression of MHCI and related
molecules.
The evolution of b2-m is similarly represented by the
four re-rooted gene trees and the species tree. The
topology of these four gene trees was compared with
the species tree by computing the Robinson-Foulds
metric. The gene tree, which better follows species evolution, was constructed by BI (difference equals to 116)
(Figure 4) and was considered as the reference gene
tree. A simple reconciliation analysis performed on 20
representative species confirmed the topology agreement
between gene and species trees (Additional file 1). The
main differences between gene and species trees are the
positions of the sequences from the unique Amphibia
organism, Xenopus laevis and Paralichthys olivaceous (a
bony fish). Choi et al. demonstrated that the b2-m of
Paralichthys olivaceous (flounder) is very similar to that
of other sea-fish, such as Raja Eglanteria, but it is phylogenetically distant from other b2-m proteins belonging
to fishes (e.g. Danio rerio (Zebrafish), Ictalurus punctatus (Catfish), Oncorhynchus mykiss (Trout) and Ctenopharyngodon idella (Carp) [9]. The reconciled trees
show few duplications of the gene that explains the difference between species and gene trees (Additional file

2); it is interesting that the first duplication seems to be
influenced by the presence of Leu or Trp95. Similar
conclusions can be achieved by analysing the more complex tree obtained from the reconciliation of the whole
gene and species trees (Additional file 3).
In the gene tree reported in Figure 4, the name of
each related protein is preceded by the one letter code
of the two residues associated with the 96 and 137 positions corresponding to Trp60 and Trp95, respectively,
in mature b2-m. The comparison between the species

and the gene trees allows us to analyse the phylogenetic
evolution of positions 60 and 95. Most of the sequences
contain tryptophan. Only a few sequences have different
amino acids in these positions. In particular, a pseudocluster of three proteins, derived from Chondrichthyes
(cartilaginous fishes), Actinopterygii (bony fishes) and
Amphibia (amphibians), contains Trp at position 60 and
Leu at position 95 instead of Trp. It is worth noting
that the gene tree clearly shows an evolutionary divergence of b2-m in warm-blooded vertebrates and fish [8].

Figure 2 Conservation analysis performed on the multiple alignment with the JalView applet.

Thus, the phylogenetic analysis shows that, in some species belonging to lineages like cartilaginous fishes and
amphibians, there is a different hydrophobic residue,
leucine, at position 95. Most likely, Trp95 is the result
of a diversification process arising during the evolution
of the adaptive immune response system [8]. The evidence that all species encoding MHCI contain Trp60
demonstrates the essential role of this residue. These
results were confirmed by performing both joint and
marginal reconstruction of the ancestral sequence: this
sequence has a Trp at position 60 and a Leu at position
95 with good joint log likelihood values at these positions; moreover, good confidence of the reconstruction
at these sites was estimated by marginal probabilities
(94% for Trp and 69% for Leu).
Experimental analysis of the role of the two Trp residues
in the structure and function of b2-m

We have previously shown that the invariance of Trp in
the evolutionary tree can be rationalized by the essential
role of Trp60 in the binding of the MHCI complex [5].
In fact, the indole ring of Trp60 fits perfectly into a
low-polarity niche within the heavy-chain association
interface (PDB entry 2BSS); it provides an interchain
hydrogen bond that is highly conserved in complexes
with MHCI and CD1 [10]. Trp60 is completely exposed
to solvent in its role of anchoring b2-m to MHCI, while
Trp95 is fully buried in the hydrophobic core of the
protein and its replacement with a small non-hydrophobic amino acid, such as glycine, affects the overall structure and stability of b2-m [5]. The discovery, through
phylogenetic analysis, that three basal species from the
classes Chondrichthyes, Actinopterygii and Amphibia display a Leu in position 95 prompted us to produce a
Leu95 variant of human b2-m to analyse the effect of
this replacement on the stability and dynamics of b2-m
folding. Since the main intrinsic fluorescence of b2-m

originates from Trp95, we have investigated its folding
stability and kinetics using circular dichroism (CD). Figure 5 reports the comparative analysis of guanidinium
chloride (GdnHCl) unfolding of the Trp95Leu variant
and wild-type b2-m, monitored through analysis of CD
spectra and measurement of ellipticity at 215 nm. The
presence of Leu at site 95 induces a destabilization of
1.0 kcal/mol, with a C m shift from 1.9 to 1.65 M
GdnHCl. Stopped flow CD apparatus was required to
monitor the kinetics of folding and unfolding (Figure 6)
on the millisecond to second time-scale, whereas a conventional CD spectropolarimeter was used to determine
slow changes in the minute time-scale. The kinetics of
folding of b2-m can be dissected into three phases: a
very fast phase occurring in the lag time of the measurement (< 5 ms), followed by a fast (Figure 6, panel A)
and a slow phase (Figure 6, panel B). The presence of
Leu does not affect the measurable phase of refolding;
the hydrophobicity of the Leu side chain guarantees the
collapse of the hydrophobic core of the molecule and
further organization of the secondary structure with the
same efficiency as Trp. In fact, the rate constant of the
fast phase of folding, monitored at 215 nm, was 1.65 (±
0.8) s -1 for both proteins. The full recovery of native
structure was measured in the near UV region and
kinetic traces were acquired at the representative wavelength of 263 nm. In each case, an exponential phase
was detected and the same resulting rate constant, 0.003
(± 0.0004) s-1 , was determined for both proteins. The
lack of the Trp95 indole ring affects mainly the folding
stability; in fact the unfolding kinetics is affected by the
Trp-Leu replacement. Figure 6 (panel C) shows that
upon exposure to 5.1 M GdnHCl, Leu95 b2-m unfolds
at a higher rate constant, 0.4 (± 0.06) s-1 compared with
the wild-type protein, 0.22 (± 0.03) s-1, in perfect agreement with the reduced stability of the variant at
equilibrium.

Figure 3 Species tree extracted using the NCBI Taxonomy Browser. The main taxonomic groups are highlighted.

A reduced folding stability of b2-m variants generally
correlates with a higher propensity for self aggregation
and formation of amyloid fibrils [5]. In Figure 7 we
report the results of the fibrillogenesis test carried out
at neutral pH and 20% trifluoroethanol (TFE), where we
compared the amount of amyloid fibrils produced from
wild-type and the Leu95 variant of b2-m. Both the thioflavin assay and the classical green birefringence typical
of amyloid clearly confirm the hypothesis of a higher
amyloidogenic propensity of the variant carrying this
ancestral amino acid substitution.

The experimental data are in good agreement with the
prediction of the aggregation propensity, calculated
according to Tartaglia et al [11]. In particular, the carboxy
terminal end of the protein around position 95 shows a
significantly lower aggregation propensity for human b2m compared with that of Raja b2-m. (Figure 8).
Crystal structure of the Trp95Leu b2-m mutant

The Trp95Leu mutant was crystallised according to the
protocol used for the Trp60Val b2-m mutant [12], yielding crystals belonging to the same space group and with

the same crystal packing observed for the b2-m DE loop
mutants, as recently reported [5,12,13]. Trp95Leu
mutant crystals diffracted to a resolution of 1.57 Å. In
accordance with the single residue mutation, the
Trp95Leu mutant crystal structure is very similar to that
of wild-type b2-m (R.S.M.D. 0.55 Å, calculated over 97
Ca pairs), and the mutated Leu95 side chain matches

the location of the Trp95 indole ring in the wild-type
protein (Figure 9 and Table 1). On the other hand, the
cavity created by residues Ser11, Asn21, Leu23, Phe70,
Pro72 and Tyr78, which perfectly fits the bulky side
chain of Trp95 in wild-type b2-m, is only half filled by
Leu95 (Figure 7). Given the hydrophobicity of the cavity,
however, no water molecules appear to fill the gaps,

leaving the cavity partially empty. Such a condition is
unfavourable for protein stability and, together with the
loss of an H bond, certainly contributes to the lower stability observed for the Trp95Leu mutant. In fact, Trp95
can establish an H bond with the carbonyl of Asp96
(wild-type b2-m code 2YXF) or with the carboxyl group
of Met99 (Trp60Gly mutant code 2Z9T). Consequently,
the presence of the mutated Leu95 residue is reflected
by increased flexibility of the downstream residues. The
whole 96-99 segment displays poor electron density, and
could only be modelled with 0.5 occupancy. Conversely,
all previously reported mutants that were crystallized
under the same conditions and whose crystals were isomorphous with those of the Trp95Leu mutant, consistently showed very good electron density for the Cterminal segment [5,12,13].
Another unexpected structural difference observed in
the Trp95Leu mutant is located in the DE loop. Such a
loop was observed in several conformations in different
b2-m structures and/or variants [12], but it always displayed high quality electron density. In the Trp95Leu
isoform the electron density for the DE loop is of poor
quality; such a loop was modelled in two alternative
conformations, with residual electron density suggesting
an even higher number of conformations. Relative to
the DE loop, residue 95 is located on the opposite pole
of the b2-m tertiary structure; in the crystal packing,
however, the two regions, from spatially neighbouring
molecules, fall close to each other, hence the observed
flexibility of the C-terminal region may affect the conformational flexibility of the DE loop.

Conclusions
Our study indicates that Trp60 of b2-m is highly conserved, which is consistent with its essential role in the
binding of b2-m to the heavy chain of MHCI. In contrast,
Trp95 is buried in a hydrophobic cavity and contributes
to protein stability and in some species is replaced by
Leu (for example, within cartilaginous fish and amphibians). Our data suggest that the divergence between Trp
or Leu at position 95 and the subsequent selection of Trp
in the very large majority of species is based on a significant thermodynamic stabilization of the protein which
also limits the intrinsic propensity of b2-m to make amyloid fibrils [3]. Such an effect can be explained by the perfect fit of Trp95 in the hydrophobic cavity delimited by
the side chains of Ser11, Leu23, Phe70, Pro72, Tyr78 and
Arg97 (Figure 9) in the core of b2-m.
Moreover, because the tendency to self-aggregate correlates with intracellular sequestration and degradation
through quality control, it is plausible that a better stability and a lower aggregation propensity have favoured
a much better yield of correctly folded b2-m.
Methods
Definition of the protein family

A protein (or gene) family consists of all the sequences
homologous to the protein of interest. To retrieve these
sequences, one approach is a simple similarity search
against current databases, performed using the Blast
algorithm. A more accurate approach is based on the
databases of homologous genes, which are available as
HOVERGEN, HOGENOM and HOMOLENS [14-17].
A BLASTP search of our protein of interest (human
b2-m) against the NCBInr database allowed us to
retrieve homologous sequences only from vertebrates.
As a consequence we decided to consider HOVERGEN
(Homologous vertebrate gene families) as a reference
database [18-20]. HOVERGEN contains all vertebrate
protein sequences from the UniProt Knowledgebase
(Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL) grouped according to similarity scores; the results of this clustering have been processed to avoid inconsistencies. We identified the
human b2-m family using the FamFetch tool by searching HOVERGEN release 48 (May 2007) with the entry
name of the protein of interest, i.e. Uniprot entry name
B2MG_HUMAN.
Following the approach used by Tourasse [14], the
orthology of sequences was assessed by examination of
the phylogenetic tree of the family provided in HOVERGEN. When multiple sequences were present for a
given species, only the sequence more similar to the
remaining sequences was kept, while avoiding the selection of sequences annotated as a fragment; in this way
the possibility of multiple substitutions at the same site
is minimized.

Multiple alignment and conservation analysis

We used HOVERGEN to provide a multiple alignment
for every family obtained by MUSCLE [21]; however, we
also performed a further analysis using CLUSTALW
[22,23], which is the most commonly used algorithm for
this task [16,17,24]. Sequences were aligned with CLUSTALW version 2.0.12 using the default parameters
(except for gap open penalty = 1).
A simple conservation analysis was performed using
the tool, JALVIEW [25,26]. Three measures were computed: (i) alignment conservation annotation measures
the number of conserved physicochemical properties for
each column of the alignment applying the approach
used in the AMAS method [27]; (ii) alignment quality
annotation is a measure of the likelihood of observing
mutations (if any) in a particular column of the alignment. The quality score is calculated for each column in
the multiple alignment by summing, for all mutations,
the ratio of the two BLOSUM62 scores for a mutation
pair and each residue’s conserved BLOSUM62 score
(which is higher); (iii) alignment consensus annotation is
composed by the most frequent residue per column of
the alignment, hence it represents the percentage frequency of these amino acids.
Phylogenetic tree

Phylogenetic (or gene) tree analysis was based on multiple alignment using four different methods for tree
reconstruction: Neighbor-Joining, Maximal Parsimony,
Minimum Evolution and Bayesian Inference [28,29] The
first three methods were applied using MEGA 4 [30-32].
We used the Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) amino acid
substitution matrix, which is based on the same counting approach as the PAM matrix but uses a much
enlarged database [33]; it is widely used for phylogenetic
analysis [16,17] and is the most suitable choice for vertebrates [34]. Statistical reliability of the nodes was
assessed by bootstrap analysis (1000 replications) [35].
BI was performed using MrBayes 3.1.2 [36,37]. Four
Markov chains of 30,000 generations were run (after a
5000-generation burn-in) at the default temperature
(0.2) with a random starting tree and a sampling frequency of 10. A mixed substitution model was set by
allowing model jumping between nine fixed-rate amino
acid models.
The four phylogenetic trees (or gene trees) were rerooted by selecting as root the gene belonging to the
most basal species. The species tree of the organisms of
interest was retrieved to select the best root. This species tree was also useful to analyse the evolution of the
protein of interest (and specific amino acids) in comparison with species evolution. The taxonomy of the organisms is usually considered as a species tree. In
particular, we used NCBI Taxonomy Browser to extract

the taxonomy tree of the analysed organisms [38,39]. It
employs a database of all the organisms represented in
the NCBI sequence database, and can automatically
build a species tree using organisms selected by the
user. When the root was selected, all the trees were rerooted exploiting the functionalities of MEGA software.
To evaluate how the protein follows species evolution, a
comparison of the topology between the gene tree and
the species tree was carried out using the Robinson-

and raja (red line) b2-m calculated with the Zyggregator
method [11]. Zagg represents the intrinsic propensity to form

Foulds metric implemented in MrBayes [40]. To evaluate the topology agreement and to highlight the importance of the amino acids under investigation, a simple
reconciliation analysis was performed by GeneTree 1.3.0
[41]. For simplifying the interpretation of the results, we
considered only 20 proteins corresponding to the most
representative species. Reconciliation analysis was also
performed on the whole gene and species tree using the
Notung 2.6 program [42].
Two specific amino acids of the reference protein
sequence were the subjects of the evolutionary analysis
(i.e. Trp60 and Trp95); therefore, we stored the positions of these amino acids. We extracted the amino
acids localized in the stored positions within each
sequence by considering the multiple alignments
obtained as reference. In particular, we added the information related to these amino acids by concatenating
the one letter code in the entry name of the proteins to
generate a close-up of the amino acid evolution. To perform this procedure we used Phytreetool, contained in
the Bioinformatics Toolbox 2.5 of MATLAB Version
7.4.0.287 (R2007a). Moreover, a formal ancestral
sequence reconstruction was performed using the
FASTML tool, assuming a gamma distribution of rates
among sites [43].

ellipticities was analysed as a function of denaturant
concentration according to the method described by
Santoro and Bolen, to yield the free energy of unfolding
in the absence of denaturant and the GdnHCl concentration at half denaturation [44]. Experimental data were
converted to the unfolded fraction using fU = (y - yN)/
(yU - yN), where y is the ellipticity value at a given denaturant concentration, and y N and yU are the values of
the native and unfolded protein, respectively, extrapolated from the pre- and post- transition base lines
defined by the Santoro and Bolen equation [44].
Folding kinetics followed by far and near-UV Circular
Dichroism

A Bio-Logic SFM 3 stopped-flow device coupled to a
Jasco 710 spectropolarimeter was used to monitor the
rapid changes of ellipticity occurring during folding and
unfolding of proteins. Stopped flow traces were monitored at 215 nm with a 2 mm path-length FC-20 cell. All
the experiments were performed at 30°C in 10 mM
sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 with 0.3 mg/ml final
protein concentration. The unfolding reactions were performed using a 10-fold dilution of a denaturant free solution of protein at 3 mg/ml with 8 volumes of buffer
containing 6 M GdnHCl and one volume of 3 M GdnHCl
to yield a final denaturant concentration of 5.1 M. The
refolding experiments were carried out using a tenfold
dilution of protein samples at 3mg/ml unfolded in 3 M
GdnHCl into 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4.
Slow changes during folding were monitored with a
Jasco 710 spectropolarimeter in the near UV region
using a 10 mm path-length cell at 30°C and a wavelength of 263 nm. For each protein, one volume of 3
mg/ml denatured at equilibrium in 3 M GdnHCl, was
mixed with nine volumes of 10 mM sodium phosphate

buffer, pH 7.4. In each case, wavelengths were chosen in
regions of maximum spectral change between the native
and the denatured protein forms previously recorded in
the steady-state CD spectra (data not shown). All the
kinetic traces acquired as a function of time from
unfolding and folding experiments were fitted as previously described [45].

Additional file 2: Reconciled tree for the reduced b2-microglobulin
gene family. The reduced gene tree was reconciled using GeneTree
with the species tree. Squares indicate duplication events, grey lines
indicate absent genes, either lost from those species or not yet
sequenced.
Additional file 3: Reconciled tree for the whole b2-microglobulin
gene family. The gene tree was reconciled with the species tree using
Notung 2.6 (parameter values: 0.9 for losses, 1.35 for duplications, and no
cost for conditional duplications). The D/L Score has been used to infer
the root of a gene tree. Red squares indicate duplication events, grey
lines indicate absent genes, either lost from those species or not yet
sequenced. Edges with the minimum root score are highlighted in red
and edges with near optimal scores are in pink.

Amyloid fibril formation

Wild-type and Trp95Leu b2-m amyloid aggregation was
carried out by incubating 100 μM of protein at 37°C in 50
mM phosphate buffer and 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, in the
presence of 20% (v/v) TFE [46]. b2-m fibril seeds (20 μg/
ml) were added to the samples to prime fibrillogenesis.
Amyloid formation was evaluated by both microscopic
analysis of the samples stained with Congo red as
described previously [47] and by the thioflavin T (ThT)
assay according to LeVine [48]. ThT (Sigma-Aldrich St.
Louis, MO 63103, USA) concentration was 10 μM in 50
mM glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 8.5. Measurements were
recorded from three independent experiments in triplicate using a Perkin Elmer LS50 spectrofluorometer with
excitation and emission wavelengths at 445 and 485 nm,
respectively, with slits set at 5 nm.
Crystallization and structure determination

The b2-m Trp95Leu mutant was crystallized under the
same conditions used for the b2-m Trp60Val mutant
[12]. X-ray diffraction data were collected using the
crystallization mother liquor (19-20% PEG 4000, 20%
glycerol, 0.2 M ammonium acetate, 0.1 M MES pH 6.0)
as cryoprotectant on an ID14-1 crystallography beamline, at 100 K (ESRF, Grenoble, Switzerland). Diffraction
data were processed using MOSFLM and SCALA
[49,50]. b2-m Trp95Leu structure solution was achieved
by molecular replacement, using MOLREP [51] and the
wild-type b2-m atomic coordinates (PDB entry 1LDS) as
search model. The structure was then refined with
REFMAC5, at 1.57 Å resolution, applying the maximum
likelihood residual, anisotropic B-factor refinement, riding hydrogen atoms, and atomic displacement parameter
refinement using the ‘tls’ method [52]. Model building
and structure analysis was performed with COOT [53].
Figure 8 was prepared using Pymol (http://www.pymol.
org). Atomic coordinates and structure factors for b2-m
Trp95Leu have been deposited with the Protein Data
Bank, with accession code 3QDA.
