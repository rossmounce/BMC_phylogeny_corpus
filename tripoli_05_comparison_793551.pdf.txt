Background: In eukaryotic cells, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) uses the products of both
nuclear and mitochondrial genes to generate cellular ATP. Interspecies comparative analysis of
these genes, which appear to be under strong functional constraints, may shed light on the
evolutionary mechanisms that act on a set of genes correlated by function and subcellular
localization of their products.

The accessibility of whole-genome sequence data for several
organisms, together with the development of efficient computer-based search tools, has revolutionized modern biology,
allowing in-depth comparative analysis of genomes [1-4]. In

many cases, comparisons among species at various levels of
divergence have helped to define protein-coding genes, recognize nonfunctional genes, and find regulatory sequences
and other functional elements in the genome. When applied
to a set of genes correlated by function and/or subcellular

interactions

Conclusions: Quickly achieving an expression pattern different from the parent genes may be
required for new OXPHOS gene duplicates to be maintained in the genome. This may be a general
evolutionary mechanism for originating phenotypic changes that could lead to species
differentiation.

Results: We have identified and annotated the Drosophila melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura and
Anopheles gambiae orthologs of 78 nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins involved in
oxidative phosphorylation by a comparative analysis of their genomic sequences and organization.
We have also identified 47 genes in these three dipteran species each of which shares significant
sequence homology with one of the above-mentioned OXPHOS orthologs, and which are likely to
have originated by duplication during evolution. Gene structure and intron length are essentially
conserved in the three species, although gain or loss of introns is common in A. gambiae. In most
tissues of D. melanogaster and A. gambiae the expression level of the duplicate gene is much lower
than that of the original gene, and in D. melanogaster at least, its expression is almost always strongly
testis-biased, in contrast to the soma-biased expression of the parent gene.

localization of their products, intra- and interspecies comparative analyses can be especially efficient tools to obtain information on the functional constraints acting on the evolution
of the gene set and on the mechanisms regulating its coordinate expression.
A set of genes present in all eukaryotic genomes and expected
to be subject to peculiar evolutionary constraints is represented by the genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS), the primary energy-producing process in all aerobic organisms [5]. To generate cellular ATP, OXPHOS uses
the products of both nuclear and mitochondrial genes, organized in five large complexes embedded in the lipid bilayer of
the inner mitochondrial membrane. Except for complex II,
which is formed by four proteins encoded by nuclear genes,
the other respiratory complexes depend on both mitochondrial and nuclear genomes; so, assembling the OXPHOS complexes and fine tuning their activity to satisfy cell- and tissuespecific energy demands requires specialized regulatory
mechanisms and evolutionary strategies to optimize the
cross-talk between the two genomes and ensure the coordinated expression of their relevant products.
Analysis of co-regulated mitochondrial and nuclear genes,
and of the transcription factors regulating the functional network they constitute, might also be a useful approach to
investigate the origin of mitochondrial dysfunction in
humans. Disorders of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation are now recognized as the most common inborn errors of
metabolism, affecting at least one in 5,000 newborn children
[6]. In this context, the expanding spectrum of identified
mitochondrial proteins provides an opportunity to test a
whole new range of candidate genes whose mutations may be
responsible for common human diseases. For example, a
recent study by Mootha et al. [7] suggests a promising strategy for clarifying the molecular etiology of mitochondrial
pathologies by profiling the tissue-specific expression pattern
of candidate mitochondrial proteins.
Despite the long evolutionary divergence time, many key
pathways that control development and physiology are conserved between Drosophila and humans, and about 70% of
the genes associated with human disease have direct counterparts in the Drosophila genome [8,9]. For example, the
potential role of Drosophila as a model system for understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in human
genetic disease is validated by the recent identification of a
Drosophila mutation causing a necrotic phenotype that mimics in detail the diseases that arise from serpin mutations in
humans [10].
It has been suggested that comparisons between D. melanogaster and other species of the genus Drosophila could
provide a model system for developing and testing new algorithms and strategies for the functional annotation of complex genomes [3]. To obtain new information on the evolution

of a set of genes that control a basic biological function by
encoding products targeted to a specific cellular compartment, we have performed a comparative analysis of the
OXPHOS genes of D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura;
the complete genome of the latter was recently made available
by the Baylor Human Genome Sequencing Center. These two
species are the only species of the Drosophila genus for which
whole-genome sequence data exist at present [11-13]. We also
took advantage of the complete sequence of the A. gambiae
genome [14] to compare the Drosophila OXPHOS genes with
those of this more distantly related dipteran (the divergence
time between D. melanogaster and A. gambiae is thought to
be approximately 250 million years, as compared to 46 million years between D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura
[15,16]). Although extensive reshuffling within and between
chromosomal regions is known to have occurred since the
divergence of Anopheles from Drosophila [4,17,18], we show
that in these organisms the conservation of the OXPHOS
genes is still sufficient to permit their meaningful
comparison.
Here we report the identification of 78 D. pseudoobscura and
78 A. gambiae genes representing the counterparts of D. melanogaster OXPHOS genes which, in turn, were previously
identified as putative orthologs of human OXPHOS genes
[19]. We have annotated these genes, taking into account conservation in amino-acid sequence, intron-exon structure,
intron length, and the presence of duplications in the
genome. The conservation of genomic organization and evidence from evolutionary trees based on sequence similarity
suggest that these genes are one-to-one orthologs in the three
species, and that in many cases they originated (produced?)
duplicates by transpositional and/or recombinational events
during evolution. We have identified in the three dipteran
genomes a total of 47 genes that probably originated by duplication of the above-mentioned genes, and we show that the
duplicate gene has usually acquired a pattern of expression
strikingly different from that of the gene from which it
derived. Moreover, when the comparison is possible, the gene
duplicate almost always shows a strongly testis-biased
expression, in contrast to the soma-biased expression of its
parent gene.

Results and discussion
Identification and comparative annotation of D.
pseudoobscura and A. gambiae OXPHOS genes
We have previously reported [19] the identification of 285 D.
melanogaster nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins that represent the counterparts of human peptides
annotated in the Swiss-Prot database as mitochondrial [20].
On the basis of comparative evidence obtained by BLASTP
analysis, 78 of these genes are involved in the OXPHOS system, encoding 66 proteins known to be components of the
five large respiratory complexes and 12 proteins involved in
oxidative phosphorylation as accessory proteins. To identify

the putative counterparts of the D. melanogaster OXPHOS
genes in D. pseudoobscura and A. gambiae we performed a
TBLASTN search [13,21] on the whole genome sequences of
these species using the amino-acid sequences of the 78 D.
melanogaster peptides as queries. Sequences giving the best
reciprocal BLAST hits were tentatively assumed to identify
functional counterparts in two species if they could be aligned
over at least 60% of the gene length and the BLAST E-score
was less than 10-30. By these criteria, all the 78 D. melanogaster OXPHOS genes investigated have a counterpart
both in D. pseudoobscura and in A. gambiae. To better compare the structure of the OXPHOS genes in the three dipteran
species, we used the predicted coding sequences as queries
for a search of expressed sequence tags (EST) [21], and used
the retrieved sequences to annotate the transcribed noncoding sequences of the A. gambiae genes investigated. Although
little EST information is available for D. pseudoobscura, it
was still possible to predict unambiguously the exon-intron
gene structure of the OXPHOS genes in this species, as well as
the amino-acid sequence of their full-length products, by
exploiting the high level of similarity with D. melanogaster.
The results of BLAST analysis, together with the construction
of phylogenetic trees that also include other genes that show
lesser but still significant sequence similarity to the 78 genes
assumed to be one-to-one orthologs in the three species
investigated (see below), strongly suggest that the newly identified D. pseudoobscura and A. gambiae genes are the functional counterparts of the 78 D. melanogaster genes used as
probes.

they are much higher if the putative amino-terminal presequences are excluded, since such sequences, possessed by
most mitochondrion-targeted products, show little aminoacid sequence conservation [23,24], although they do share
specific physicochemical properties [25,26]. When only the
predicted mature protein is considered, the average percentage identity increases to 90% between D. melanogaster and
D. pseudoobscura, and to 70% between D. melanogaster and
A. gambiae.
A striking example of evolutionary conservation is provided
by the genes encoding cytochrome c (an essential and ubiquitous protein found in all organisms) in the three dipteran species: the amino-acid sequences of the gene products are
identical in D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura, whereas
96% identity is preserved between Drosophila and Anopheles. Coding sequences are also extremely conserved, suggesting that the nucleotide sequence itself is subject to strong
evolutionary constraints, maybe due to codon usage bias.
Only synonymous substitutions (21 out of 108 codons) were
found on comparing D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura
cytochrome c coding sequences, whereas 28 synonymous
substitutions and only four nonsynonymous substitutions
were observed between D. melanogaster and A. gambiae (see
MitoComp website [22]).

Gene structure comparisons
It is well known that a given function may be supplied in different species by genes that are not directly derived from a
common ancestor, that is, by paralogous, not orthologous,
genes. Therefore, we thought it would be interesting to compare the structural organization of the OXPHOS genes in the
three species investigated, on the principle that it should be
possible to infer derivation from a common ancestor, that is,
'structural orthology', if an identical or very similar overall
structure was preserved. As the introns of the putative orthologous OXPHOS genes in the three species are, as expected,
too divergent in DNA sequence to be aligned, we used conservation of number of introns, conservation of their location in
the coding sequence, and preservation of the reading frame
with respect to the flanking exons as our primary criteria.
With the only exception of Dpse\CG5037, putatively encoding protoheme IX farnesyltransferase, whose 5' genomic
sequence was impossible to find in the relevant contig assembly, all other investigated D. pseudoobscura genes show a
structural organization almost identical to that of their D.
melanogaster counterparts. Of the 78 Anopheles genes studied, 39 maintain the structural organization observed in Drosophila, whereas gain or loss of introns occurred in 33, and in
six the location of introns is not preserved at all. In agreement
with a previous report [4], the intron-exon structure of the

converse, have been rare in the evolutionary history of these
species: only seven class changes were observed comparing
D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura introns, and six
between D. melanogaster and A. gambiae (Figure 3b). On the
whole, our data confirm the highly asymmetrical intron
length distribution in D. melanogaster and extend this finding to the introns of the D. pseudoobscura and A. gambiae

natural selection. For example, in D. melanogaster and several other organisms the distribution of intron length has
been shown to be asymmetrical, with a large group of introns
falling into a narrow distribution around a 'minimal' length
and the remaining showing a much broader length distribution, ranging from hundreds to thousands of base-pairs [3032].

reviews

Genes encoding the acyl carrier protein (mtacp1) in the three
species are characterized by the mutually exclusive use of
homologous exons that are repeated in tandem (Figure 2a).
The duplicate exons occur at the same location in the aligned
amino-acid sequences, and are flanked on both sides by a
phase 1 intron. When the sequences of the duplicated exons
are compared, they show the expected divergence pattern
(that is, the similarity between duplicate exons within a gene
is less than the similarity of each exon to its equivalent in the
orthologous gene). Evidence from genomic and transcribed
sequences (GenBank accession numbers BI510891 and
BI508135) shows that the duplicated mtacp1exons are also
preserved in the more distantly related insect Apis mellifera
(honeybee) (Figure 2c,d), indicating a specific adaptive benefit for this gene structure, as also suggested by the evolutionary convergence leading to the occurrence of alternative
splicing in members of three different ion-channel gene families from Drosophila to humans [28]. However, there is no
evidence from ESTs that duplicated mtacp1 exons undergo
alternative splicing in vertebrates and nematodes.

comment

when splicing of alternative coding exons occurs: the alternative splice forms of both the Drosophila NADH-ubiquinone
oxidoreductase acyl carrier protein (mtacp1, CG9160) [27]
and the Drosophila ATP synthase epsilon chain (sun,
CG9032) [19] have very similar counterparts in Anopheles, as
shown by genomic structure comparison, alignment of splice
variants and EST mapping (Figure 2).

OXPHOS gene duplications

information

Genome Biology 2005, 6:R11

interactions

In A. gambiae we found only four duplications and two triplications of the OXPHOS genes analyzed; of these, four
involve genes also duplicated in one or both Drosophila species (Table 2). Pairwise orthology could not be assigned
between Drosophila and Anopheles gene duplicates as neither microsynteny nor evolutionary trees provide sufficient
evidence for the origin of the gene pairs from a single-copy
gene before the Drosophila/Anopheles divergence.

refereed research

On the basis of the presence of the duplication in both species,
supported by evidence from evolutionary trees and conservation of microsyntenic gene order, it can be inferred that 15 of
the duplications identified occurred before the D. melanogaster/D. pseudoobscura divergence (about 46 million
years ago). On the other hand, five duplications were found
only in D. melanogaster and four only in D. pseudoobscura;
in these instances, if the duplication occurred before the
divergence of the two species, it has been followed by loss of
one of the copies in the lineage leading to the species in which
the gene is no longer duplicated. On the assumption that the
rate of gene duplication is constant over time, this translates
to approximately 0.0014 duplications per gene per million
years (4 or 5 duplications per 78 genes per 46 million years)
that achieved fixation and long-term preservation in the
genome. This value is about twofold lower than the 0.0023
value calculated by Lynch and Conery [37] for the 13,601
genes of the whole genome of D. melanogaster. However, it
can be argued that the rate of long-term preservation in the
genome of OXPHOS gene duplicates cannot be meaningfully
compared with the general rate of preservation of duplicates
in the whole genome since, while recent data suggest that in
eukaryotic genomes there is preferential duplication of conserved proteins [38], duplicates of genes that encode subunits
of multiprotein complexes, as most of the genes we have
investigated do, negatively influence the fitness of an organism [39], and are therefore unlikely to become fixed in the
population. In summary, it appears reasonable to assume
that the preservation in the genome of OXPHOS gene duplicates should occur very infrequently, unless special mechanisms allowing their fixation in the population are present
(see the next section).

deposited research

Duplications (or triplications) of 16 of the 78 OXPHOS genes
investigated were found in both D. melanogaster and D.
pseudoobscura. In such cases, to assign pairwise orthology,
besides taking into account conservation of structural organ-

The genomic organization of many OXPHOS duplicates
shows that they were originated by retropositional events,
because they are intronless, or have only very few introns that
are likely to have been inserted into the coding sequence after
the duplication event. In other cases, duplication apparently
resulted from transposition of genomic DNA sequences or
from recombinational events, as duplicate genes maintain an
identical or very similar structural organization.

reports

Duplications, or in some instances triplications, of 24
OXPHOS genes were found. Overall, we identified 47 genes
(20 in D. melanogaster, 19 in D. pseudoobscura and eight in
A. gambiae) each of which shows significant similarity with
one of the 78 OXPHOS genes reported above. When the structure of a member of a paralogous gene set indicates that it has
been produced by retroposition, it seems reasonable to
assume that it is derived from a pre-existing 'parent' gene. For
duplicates not clearly originating by retroposition, we also
assume, on the basis of the much higher level of conservation
and expression, that the genes we find to be the structural
orthologs in all three species are the parent ones, and in this
case also we will henceforth refer to their paralogs as
OXPHOS gene duplicates. The amino-acid percentage identity between the products of duplicate gene pairs ranges from
40% to 85%. For each of the OXPHOS gene duplicates, cytological localization, number of exons interrupting the coding
sequence, and number of ESTs found in the D. melanogaster
and A. gambiae EST databases are reported in Table 2.
Neighbor-joining trees derived from distance matrix analysis
and showing the inferred evolutionary relationship between
members of each gene cluster are available at the MitoComp
website [22].

ization, given the general conservation of microsyntenic gene
order in the two species, we used the products of D. melanogaster genes flanking the duplicate loci to search for
homologous sequences also flanking the same genes in the D.
pseudoobscura genome.

reviews

Duplicate gene pairs were tentatively identified within each
genome as best reciprocal hits with an E-value of less than 1020 in both directions in a TBLASTN search using the default
parameters. Deciding whether two proteins may be considered homologous becomes difficult when their sequence
identity is within the 20-30% range (the so-called 'twilight
zone' [34]), and so the following additional criteria were used:
first, the two sequences could be aligned over more than 60%
of their length; second, the putative processed proteins
encoded had to have more than 40% identity; and third,
amino-acid percentage similarity had to be larger than percentage identity [35]. Even if meeting these criteria and
reported as different genes in the ENSEMBL database [36],
identical Anopheles nucleotide sequences were excluded
from further analysis, as they are likely to reflect annotation
artifacts.

comment

It is generally accepted that gene duplication is the basic process that underlies the diversification of genes and the origination of novel gene functions [33]; however, many features of
this process are still elusive. To obtain more information on
the molecular evolution of the genes involved in the OXPHOS
system, we searched the genomes of D. melanogaster, D.
pseudoobscura and A. gambiae for duplications of the 78
OXPHOS genes whose orthologs we have identified in the
three species.

Expression pattern of OXPHOS gene duplicates

interactions
information

Genome Biology 2005, 6:R11

refereed research

A systematic investigation of the expression pattern of other
D. melanogaster duplicate genes will be necessary to answer
the question of whether the testis-biased expression pattern
reported here is specific to the duplicates of genes encoding
mitochondrial proteins, or is a more general phenomenon.
According to the balance hypothesis, validated by experimental results obtained on yeast [39], single gene duplications
involving genes encoding components of multiprotein complexes are expected to severely affect fitness. Therefore, the
expression pattern we have observed could be a necessary
condition to maintain some gene duplicates in the D. melanogaster genome, at least until they evolve a new useful
function. Finally, as nothing is known about the tissue-specific pattern of expression of the genes investigated in D.
pseudoobscura and Anopheles, it also remains unclear
whether the testis-biased expression of gene copies originated by duplication is specific to D. melanogaster, or is also
to be found in other dipterans, and possibly in other
organisms.

deposited research

The pattern of strongly testis-biased expression of OXPHOS
gene duplicates holds for a further sample of 40 duplications
of genes annotated in the MitoDrome database [19] as encoding products that are mitochondrion-targeted but not
involved in the OXPHOS system. For 15 of these no data are

Duplications of genes encoding OXPHOS subunits, for which
stoichiometry is important, are likely to be strongly deleterious owing to the negative consequences of an imbalance in
the concentration of the respiratory complex constituents,
unless, as proposed by Lynch and Force [41], 'subfunctionalization' and/or a differential expression pattern of duplicate
copies occurs. In this case, the duplicate OXPHOS genes
would have a reduced or absent capacity to functionally complement mutations in their parent genes, in contrast to what
is generally assumed to be the main short-term advantage of
gene duplication. In D. melanogaster at least there is evidence for this, as FlyBase [42] and BDGP P-Element Gene
Disruption Project [43] searches for P-insertion mutants in
the D. melanogaster OXPHOS genes found that lethal alleles
for 11 out of 19 D. melanogaster parent genes are known (see
the MitoComp website [22]), indicating that loss-of-function
of the parent gene cannot be compensated for by the presence
of the gene duplicate. P-insertion mutants with an abnormal
phenotype, indicating a functional divergence, are known for
only one of the D. melanogaster OXPHOS gene duplicates Cyt-c-d, encoding cytochrome c). Interestingly, although Cytc-d is adjacent to its putative parent gene, Cyt-c-p, it shows a
different pattern of expression, suggesting that the two genes
must be regulated at individual gene level and not at chromatin domain level (see Table 2).

reports

Our finding that the expression of the OXPHOS gene originated by duplication is strongly testis-biased is validated by
the data obtained by Parisi et al. [40] using the FlyGEM
microarray to identify D. melanogaster genes showing ovary, testis- or soma-biased expression. With the exception of
CG7349, CG30354, CG30093 and CG12810, for which no
data were presented by Parisi et al. [40], all other genes
reported in this work as OXPHOS gene duplicates were found
in the genomic fraction showing testis-biased expression,
whereas all the parent genes present in the dataset showed
soma-biased expression. Additional data file 2 summarizes
the relevant data extracted from Parisi et al. [40].

provided by Parisi et al. [40], but all the remaining 25 genes
show a testes-biased expression (data not shown).
reviews

The relative abundance of ESTs in a EST library may be
assumed roughly to reflect the level of expression of each
mRNA in the tissues from which the library was prepared. We
therefore used the mRNA sequences predicted in silico to be
transcribed from the OXPHOS duplicate genes investigated
in this work as queries in a search of the public D. melanogaster and A. gambiae EST databases to infer the relative
abundance of the mRNA copies from the hits scored. For each
gene, the number of ESTs found in the databases is detailed
in Table 2. With the exception of one of the paralogs of the A.
gambiae gene encoding ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase
core protein 1, in all cases the search found the number of
ESTs originating from the duplicate gene was strikingly lower
than that originating from the putative parent gene, in both
D. melanogaster and A. gambiae (in total, 100 versus 1,747 in
D. melanogaster and 60 versus 687 in A. gambiae). A smaller
number of ESTs originating from the OXPHOS gene duplicates was observed even in A. gambiae EST libraries that are
normalized. Remarkably, and regardless of the mechanism of
the duplication, in D. melanogaster, in which several organspecific or developmental stage specific libraries are available, the search showed that the expression of the OXPHOS
gene duplicates is strongly testis-biased, as 97 out of the 100
ESTs originating from them were found in testis-derived
libraries, while only 27 out of the 1,769 ESTs originating from
the parent genes were found in such libraries, the bulk of

Codon usage in the OXPHOS genes

more testis-specific genes are much more frequent than
expected by chance. Therefore, we investigated the chromosomal distribution of the OXPHOS genes to determine
whether clustering could be detected. In all three dipteran
species considered, the 78 OXPHOS orthologous genes are
randomly distributed on all chromosomal arms (Table 1).
Two D. melanogaster genes (Ucrh, encoding the 11 kDa subunit of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, and CG40002,
encoding the AGGG subunit of NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) have a heterochromatic location.

In all three dipteran species, a disproportionately high fraction of OXPHOS gene duplicates appears to be constituted of
autosomal genes derived from parent genes located on the X
chromosome (Table 2). As suggested by recent work on the
generation and preservation of functional genes produced by
retroposition both in Drosophila [53] and in the human and

information

It has been reported that in many eukaryotes including yeast
[46], C. elegans [47], D. melanogaster [48,49] and humans
[50], genes with related functions and similar expression patterns tend to be clustered, suggesting that they share aspects
of transcriptional regulation depending on their inclusion in
the same chromatin domain. In particular, Boutanaev et al.
[48] reported that in D. melanogaster clusters of three or

interactions

Chromosomal arm location, interarm homology and
microsynteny

However, in accord with two studies reporting a significant
deficit of genes with a male-biased expression on the D. melanogaster X chromosome [51,52], only one out of the 20 D.
melanogaster OXPHOS gene duplicates, two out of 19 in D.
pseudoobscura and none (out of eight) in A. gambiae were
found to be X-linked (Table 2). It may be that duplications of
X-linked genes encoding OXPHOS subunits would be especially deleterious because of the male X chromosome transcriptional hyperactivity, which allows dosage compensation.

refereed research

No evidence of OXPHOS gene duplicate clustering was found
either, despite the common testis-biased expression of such
genes. Moreover, no evidence of clustering with other testisspecific genes was found when an EST database search for
such genes was performed in the regions flanking the investigated gene duplicates.

deposited research

Because of the preferential use of codons ending in C or G, the
D. melanogaster coding sequences have an average GC content higher than the genomic average [44,45]. This is also true
for the 78 D. melanogaster OXPHOS coding sequences
reported in this work and for their D. pseudoobscura and A.
gambiae counterparts (68% of the codons in the OXPHOS
genes end in C or G in D. pseudoobscura and 77% in A. gambiae, compared to 74% in D. melanogaster). In all three species, the coding sequences of OXPHOS gene duplicates show
a lower percentage of codons ending in C or G, when compared to both the entire set of 78 orthologous OXPHOS genes
and the gene subset including only their parent genes. In
samples including all the OXPHOS gene duplicates annotated
in this paper the aggregate percentage of C- or G-ending
codons is 63%, 46% and 73% in D. melanogaster, D. pseudobscura and A. gambiae respectively, as compared with 70%,
64% and 88% in their parent genes. In D. pseudoobscura, the
shift toward a higher percentage of A- or T-ending codons is
also detected in the pattern of synonymous codon usage; for
12 of the 18 amino acids that are encoded by more than one
codon, the most frequently used codon in the D. pseudoobscura gene duplicates is different from the one used in their
parent genes (see Additional data file 3).

reports

*The number of ESTs in testis-derived libraries is in parentheses. Because insufficient information on D. pseudoobscura ESTs is available in the public
EST databases, only D. melanogaster and A. gambiae ESTs were considered. Bold type is used to identify the putative orthologous genes in the three
species (see text). Only coding exons were considered. ND, location not determined. D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura and A. gambiae OXPHOS
sequences used are available at the MitoComp website [22]

mouse genomes [54], this may be explained by a selective
advantage for duplicates of X-linked genes that move to an
autosomal location and so escape the X inactivation in early
spermatogenesis that occurs both in Drosophila [55] and in
mammals [56].
We would like to speculate that such selective advantage may
be especially significant for duplicates of OXPHOS genes,
given the heavy reliance of sperm on mitochondrial function.
In fact, the excess of autosomal duplicates of X-linked genes
is not observed for MitoDrome annotated genes not involved
in the OXPHOS system (see above). However, as the general
pattern of much lower, testis-biased expression holds even for
OXPHOS and other mitochondrial gene duplicates that
apparently derive from autosomal parental genes, and even
for X-linked duplicates, this pattern (and the explanation of
the evolutionary preservation of such genes) cannot only be
due to the selective advantage of escaping X inactivation during spermatogenesis.
With the exception of CG9603, all euchromatic D. melanogaster orthologs maintain their localization on the
homologuos D. pseudoobscura chromosomal arm (Table 3).
CG9603, encoding the VIIa polypeptide of cytochrome c oxidase, is located on the 3R chromosomal arm in D. melanogaster, whereas Dpse\CG9603, its counterpart in D.
pseudoobscura, is located on XR; microsyntenic gene order
with the flanking genes is conserved in both species, suggesting that a chromosomal rearrangement occurred after their
divergence.
OXPHOS gene duplicates also almost always maintain the
same chromosomal location and microsyntenic gene order in
D. melanogaster and in D. pseudoobscura. However, a more
complex situation was observed with regard to the gene
encoding subunit IV of cytochrome c oxidase, which is
duplicated in D. melanogaster and triplicated in D. pseudoobscura (Table 2). On the basis of identical genomic organization, conserved chromosomal location and mycrosyntenic
gene order Dpse\CG10664 is inferred to be the ortholog of D.
melanogaster CG10664. Dm CG10396, Dpse\CG10396.1 and
Dpse\CG10396.2 are intronless, and neither interarm homology nor microsyntenic order offer any clue to their phylogenetic relationship. The dendrogram based on sequence
divergence (see the MitoComp website [22], complex IV, subunit IV) suggests, however, that a duplication event occurred
before the D. melanogaster/D. pseudobscura speciation,

Drosophila species, when D. melanogaster and A. gambiae
are compared the only meaningful correspondence found
concerns the genes on the D. melanogaster 2L and the A.
gambiae 3R chromosomal arms (Table 3). This result is consistent with previous reports that compared the location of
homologous genes in D. melanogaster and A. gambiae, concluding that extensive reshuffling both within and between
chromosomal regions has occurred since the divergence of
the two species [4,17].

Conclusions

We have catalogued 78 nuclear genes that control oxidative
phosphorylation in three dipteran species and compiled a
web-based dataset, MitoComp [22], that contains all the data
on which this article is based and which is available with the
online version of this article. We have conducted only some
basic comparative analyses of the many which are possible
using such a dataset, and it is our hope that it will provide a
valuable resource for those looking for information about
nuclear genes encoding mitochondrion-targeted products in
the context of functional genomics and proteomics. Future
studies based on this information, especially if the comparative analysis is extended to other species, will surely allow a
better understanding of the evolutionary history of a set of
genes that control a basic biological function, and also offer
interesting insights into the mechanisms of their coordinated
expression. In fact, a first in silico analysis of the D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura nuclear energy gene
sequences suggests that a genetic regulatory circuit, based on
a single regulatory element, coordinates the expression of the
whole set of energy-producing genes in Drosophila [57].
The comparative analysis of the 78 OXPHOS genes in the
three dipteran species shows a high level of amino-acid
sequence identity, as well as a substantial conservation of
intron-exon structure, indicating that these genes are under
strong selective constraints. An unexpected and intriguing
result of this study is that in D. melanogaster, duplicationoriginated OXPHOS genes are expressed at a much lower
level (or possibly not expressed at all) in most or all the tissues
where their parent genes are expressed, as judged by the
abundance of ESTs derived from their transcripts in all libraries other than those derived from testis. On the other hand,
OXPHOS gene duplicates have a strongly testis-biased pattern of expression, a finding validated by other authors with a
different approach based on the use of microarrays [40]. In A.
gambiae, although no testis-specific ESTs databases are
available, a pattern of expression of almost all duplicate
OXPHOS genes different from that of the gene from which
they originated, and possibly limited to specific tissues, is
suggested by the fact that in all EST libraries available the
abundance of the sequences originated from the duplicate
genes is very low when compared with that of the sequences
derived from their respective parent genes.

information

To identify orthologous OXPHOS genes and their duplications in D. pseudoobscura and A. gambiae, contigs from
BCM [13] and scaffolds from AnoBase [21] were searched
using TBLASTN with the D. melanogaster OXPHOS peptides
listed in the MitoDrome database [19] as queries.

We have named each newly identified A. gambiae gene with
the four-letter code 'agEG' followed by the last four or five digits of its Ensembl [36] gene number, excluding the multiple
zeros of the prefix; the D. pseudoobscura genes were named
with the code 'Dpse\CG' followed by the Celera number of
their D. melanogaster counterparts.

Materials and methods

The genomic sequence of each gene was manually searched
for intron-exon boundaries and the predicted mRNA
sequence reconstructed in silico. A. gambiae mRNAs were
assembled by overlapping ESTs extracted from AnoBase [21].

refereed research

No data are at present available to support the possibility that
our findings could be extrapolated to other gene sets or even
to the whole genome. However, we propose that duplication
of the genes encoding products that are part of multiprotein
complexes may be especially deleterious, unless sequence
divergence allowing only testis-specific expression of one of
the duplicate copies occurs. In turn, this could facilitate the
development of novel functions, which is usually assumed to
be the main evolutionary advantage of gene duplication,
providing a general mechanism for originating phenotypic
changes that might also lead to species differentiation.

grams were obtained using the MultAlin 5.4.1 software [61]
from MultAlin server [62].
deposited research

We suggest that, at least in D. melanogaster, the acquisition
of a new, testis-biased pattern of expression may be required
to maintain duplicates of certain genes in the genome. This
may also allow rapid acquisition of new functions by the gene
product(s), as it has recently been shown that proteins
encoded by duplicated genes with a changed expression pattern often show accelerated evolution [58,59]. Subfunctionalization could then further favor the preservation of multiple
paralogous genes.

libraries generated from head (RH) and embryos (RE) were
also considered. The relative abundance of the transcripts of
duplicate or triplicate A. gambiae OXPHOS genes was
defined by counting their cognate ESTs in all libraries recovered from the Anobase server [21]. Since the number of
sequences in the EST databases changes as new EST
sequences are added, our values are calculated on the EST
sequences present in the databases as of July 2004.
The list of D. melanogaster P-insertion OXPHOS mutants is
reported in the MitoComp website [22] and was mostly compiled using information from FlyBase [42] and from the
BDGP P-Element Gene Disruption Project [43].

Additional data files

A web-based dataset, MitoComp, contains all data on which
this work is based and is available at [22]. It includes information on the cytological location of each gene, its genomic
organization and the structure of its transcript(s). The
genomic structures of the D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura and A. gambiae putative OXPHOS orthologs are shown
and compared, and their deduced amino-acid products are
aligned with the corresponding human protein. When
paralogs of the gene exist, neighbor-joining trees derived
from distance matrix analysis are also shown to visualize the
evolutionary relationships between them. Additional data
files available with the online version of this article are as follows. Additional data file 1 contains a table that reports pairwise amino-acid sequence conservation values between the
D. melanogaster OXPHOS genes investigated and their D.
pseudoobscura, A. gambiae and human counterparts. Additional data file 2 contains data extracted from the Parisi et al.
