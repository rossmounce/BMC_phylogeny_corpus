Abstract
Background: The role of gene duplication in the structural and functional evolution of genomes
has been well documented. Analysis of complete rice (Oryza sativa) genome sequences suggested
an ancient whole genome duplication, common to all the grasses, some 50-70 million years ago and
a more conserved segmental duplication between the distal regions of the short arms of
chromosomes 11 and 12, whose evolutionary history is controversial.
Results: We have carried out a comparative analysis of this duplication within the wild species of
the genus Oryza, using a phylogenetic approach to specify its origin and evolutionary dynamics.
Paralogous pairs were isolated for nine genes selected throughout the region in all Oryza genome
types, as well as in two outgroup species, Leersia perrieri and Potamophila parviflora. All Oryza species
display the same global evolutionary dynamics but some lineage-specific features appear towards
the proximal end of the duplicated region. The same level of conservation is observed between the
redundant copies of the tetraploid species Oryza minuta. The presence of orthologous duplicated
blocks in the genome of the more distantly-related species, Brachypodium distachyon, strongly
suggests that this duplication between chromosomes 11 and 12 was formed as part of the whole
genome duplication common to all Poaceae.
Conclusion: Our observations suggest that recurrent but heterogeneous concerted evolution
throughout the Oryza genus and in related species has led specifically to the extremely high
sequence conservation occurring in this region of more than 2 Mbp.

Background
The analysis of an increasing number of complete genome
sequences has allowed in-depth studies of the role of
sequence redundancy in genome evolution [1-4]. Gene
duplication has been considered for a long time to be a
source of novel functions, and to have played a significant
part in genome functional evolution and species divergence. Hypotheses on the evolution of genes duplicated

by whole genome duplication (WGD), segmental or local
events were proposed in 1970 by Ohno [5] and models
for the evolution of these duplicated genes have since
been elaborated. Following the unexpected observation
that Arabidopsis thaliana is a paleopolyploid, a whole
genome duplication (WGD) having occurred some 35-40
million years ago (MYA) [6], it was shown that extant
plant genomes probably all result from successive cycles

of WGD/diploidization [7]. Major losses [8,9], structural
and functional divergence [10,11] or concerted evolution
[12], have all been observed in eukaryotic genomes, in
particular after whole genome duplication events.
Analysis of the complete sequences of the genomes of rice
(Oryza sativa) subspecies indica and japonica suggested two
independent duplications: a WGD that occurred between
53 and 94MYA, and which is thus common to all cereals,
and a more recent segmental duplication between the distal regions of the short arms of chromosomes 11 and 12
[13]. The relative chronology of this latter duplication and
speciation events within the Oryza genus are unclear. It
was first identified by genetic [14] and physical mapping
[15], with an estimated length of 2.5-3 Mbp. Other
authors, using synonymous substitution rates between
conserved gene pairs for dating, described a duplication of
5.44 (chromosome 11) and 4.27 Mbp (chromosome 12)
5MYA [8], 3.3 Mbp 7.7MYA [16], 3.3 Mbp 20MYA [17] or
6.5 and 4.8 Mbp 21MYA [13], while Goff et al. [18] calculated 25MYA using protein/protein alignments. According
to Gaut [19], the divergence between Erhartoideae (Oryza)
and the other Pooideae (such as wheat) is approximately
46MYA. Molecular dating places the divergence of the
Oryza-Leersia clade with other genera at ~20MYA, that of
the Oryza and Leersia genera at 14.2MYA, and divergence
of the most basal species in the genus (O. granulata) at
~10MYA [20], in agreement with fossil reports [21].
Recent data using other genes has confirmed this divergence time [22]. The evolutionary dynamics of the duplication have been studied between the two subspecies O.
sativa ssp. japonica and O. sativa ssp. indica [23]. These
authors concluded that this region could be affected by
concerted evolution.
Previous studies on the evolution of large-scale gene
duplication were based on the available genome
sequences from widely-divergent species and little is
known about the short-term evolution of duplicated copies and their role in species divergence within a genus. The
model species Oryza sativa L. and its wild relatives represent an ideal system to answer questions about gene and
genome evolution [24,25]. Genomic data and the wellcharacterized phylogeny available for this genus enable a
comparative approach of the evolutionary history of this
duplication between several closely-related species.
Adopting a phylogenetic approach, we isolated and
sequenced orthologous duplicated pairs from the region
of interest in a set of 7 representative Oryza genomes,
including tetraploid O. minuta and the surrogate parental
species O. punctata and O. officinalis, as well as in the
closely-related species Leersia perrieri and Potamophila parviflora. We demonstrate the presence and strong conservation of the duplication both within the genus and in close
outgroup species. Its presence in the more distant species

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/146

Brachypodium distachyon and Sorghum bicolor [26] suggests
that its origin is concomitant with the cereal ancestral
genome duplication and that the specific mechanisms
that have led to the high levels of sequence conservation
within this region of the Oryza genomes are probably
recurrent.

Results
Sequence conservation in subtelomeric regions of
chromosomes 11 and 12
The duplicated subtelomeric regions of Oryza sativa ssp.
japonica chromosomes 11 and 12 have been described as
being highly conserved [8,13,17]. Additional file 1 shows
a dot plot between the first 2.5 Mbp of these chromosomes. Sequence conservation is particularly high within
the first 2 Mbp. Beyond this point, large-scale conservation is no longer detectable, similarity being limited to
individual genes or blocks of genes, which are visible on
the zoom of this region. The loss of colinearity is due to
sequence divergence and the movement of transposable
elements since the duplication event.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic trees based on duplicated sequences can
have two topologies, depending on the relative dates of
the duplication and speciation events. If duplication predates speciation, we expect to find one copy of each gene
pair from all species in one branch of the tree and the
other copies in a second branch. In contrast, if the duplication follows speciation we expect to find the paralogous
gene pairs as terminal nodes. If the duplication between
chromosomes 11 and 12 occurred within the Oryza genus,
we would expect to find two gene copies for post-duplication species, with a "speciation after duplication" topology, and only one for species having diverged before the
duplication. Using primer pairs selected as described in
Methods, we amplified and sequenced gene fragments
from seven Oryza species and the closely-related Leersia
perrieri and Potamophila parviflora (Figure 1), corresponding to nine genes (named A to I for simplification)
selected along the duplicated region (Table 1). Among
these, five (B, D, E, H, I) were retained for genus-wide
analysis according to the following criteria: minimum
length of 500 bp, amplification of both exonic and
intronic sequences to clone the more variable intronic
regions and their distribution on the duplicated fragment.
The four remaining sequences (A, C, F, G) were amplified
on a reduced set of species (O. brachyantha and/or O. granulata, L. perrieri and P. parviflora). Putative functions were
verified by BLASTX alignment against Viridiplantae proteins.

Figures 2, 3 and 4 and Additional files 2 and 3 show phylogenetic trees constructed using the maximum likelihood
(ML) method, and bootstrap values for both ML and maximum parsimony (MP) analysis. Trees were rooted with

homologous copies identified in either Sorghum bicolor
[26] or Brachypodium distachyon http://www.brachypo
dium.org genomes, but the branches leading to these outgroup are not proportional to their divergence. Two copies of each sequence were isolated almost systematically in
all species including L. perrieri and P. parviflora. The fact
that two separate copies were isolated for all genes in Leersia is not surprising considering its position in our trees,
where all copies of all amplified sequences from this species are grouped in the same clade as the Oryza species.
For sequences A, C, F and G all paralogous copies group
together, showing a "duplication after speciation" topology, except for the two gene C copies of O. granulata (See
Additional files 2 and 3: ML trees inferred from genes A
(1), C (2), F (3) and G (4)). For sequences F and G, only
one copy from P. parviflora and O. granulata, respectively,
were isolated. Bootstrap values are not strong for internal
nodes, certainly because of the weak phylogenetic signal
for these sequences (Table 2), but terminal nodes grouping the paralogous copies are strongly supported.

For sequences B and D (Figure 2), two copies were isolated for all species, and all paralogous pairs are grouped
together, except for O. officinalis gene B copy 1 which
diverged earlier. Their strong conservation rate is reflected
by the weak support for internal nodes, particularly for
sequence B. For sequence D, we isolated only one copy
from O. australiensis but, given the number of clones sampled (21), the second copy has probably been deleted or
is too divergent to be amplified. Moreover, this single
copy is sister to one of the tetraploid O. minuta copies,
which was not expected. Overall, sequences B and D
clearly show a "duplication after speciation" topology
type.
On the other hand, sequences E and I display a "duplication before speciation" topology (Figure 3). Only one
copy of gene E was isolated for O. brachyantha and O. granulata, but for all other species the two copies are separated.
One copy forms a monophyletic clade with the Nipponbare chromosome 11 sequence, while the second and
third copies of O. punctata and O. minuta are grouped with
the Nipponbare paralog on chromosome 12. The second
copies from O. officinalis, O. australiensis, L. perrieri and P.
parviflora, as well as the single copies from O. brachyantha
and O. granulata, are grouped in a second, large clade,
being more divergent from the copy 1 in these more
ancient species. This is in agreement with the hypothesis
of an independent divergence of the two paralogous
sequences after duplication, the O. brachyantha and O.
granulata single copies belonging to the "chromosome
12" clade.
In the ML tree of gene I we clearly observe separation
between paralogs from O. brachyantha, O. australiensis, O.
officinalis, O. punctata, O. minuta and Nipponbare, each
paralogous set for these species forming a monophyletic
group. However, neither the ML nor the MP trees allow
clarification of the relationships between the copies of the
older species, P. parviflora, L. perrieri and O. granulata. This
analysis is complicated by the fact that we isolated only

one paralog for P. parviflora and O. granulata. We observed
a 221 bp repeat element insertion, accompanying a deletion in copy 2 of O. brachyantha, but no topology change
was observed when excluding this large indel event before
analysis. This repeat sequence belongs to the MITE castaway-like family (BLASTN against the TIGR-Oryza-repeat
v3.3 database, e-value = 7.2e-5).
For gene H, we obtained peculiar results (Figure 4). The
first obvious observation is the number and position of
copies of the outgroup L. perrieri. We get at least 4 different
copies, listed 1 to 4, respectively sister to O. punctata 1, O.
minuta 1, O. punctata 2, and the clade regrouping O. officinalis and O. minuta 3. This result was checked by three
independent cycles of cloning-sequencing, with two different L. perrieri DNA extracts. Only one copy was isolated
for the most distant species P. parviflora, O. brachyantha
and O. granulata, as well as for O. officinalis, and the two
copies of O. australiensis are separated. However, both
copies of O. punctata (if we except L. perrieri copies), O.
minuta, and Nipponbare were closely related. As a result

we have a mixed topology, with paralogous sequences
evolving independently in the older species.
Paralogous pair divergence
To investigate potential bias in paralog divergence, we first
compared the sequence data sets (Table 2). The number of
parsimony informative sites and indel events are given for
information. The mean rates of synonymous (dS) and
non-synonymous (dN) substitutions are the means for all
sequence comparisons in each data set. Mean dS varies
from 0.040 for sequence B to 0.150 for sequence F, mean
dN varies from 0.010 for sequences C and H to 0.1 for
sequence E, and mean K varies from 0.084 for sequence B
to 0.236 for sequence F. There seems to be no correlation
between the two kinds of observed topologies and the global divergence values of the data set, indicating that these
genes are evolving at equivalent rates, whatever the proportion of within-species concerted evolution.

We show divergence values between each paralogous pair
in Additional file 4. It would have been interesting to

compute combined data set analysis, at least for a complete sampling matrix, in order to increase information
support, but this was not possible as the paralogous pairs
were not isolated for all species. We were particularly
interested in the dS values, to examine global neutral evolution of our duplicated pairs, and the dN/dS ratio, to verify the neutrality hypothesis and detect signatures of
positive selection. Mean dS values for paralogous pairs for
each species ranged from 0.01 for O. granulata to 0.09 for
O. australiensis, but there is a bias due to missing paralogs
in some data sets. Paralogous dS rates were not significantly different (with p < 0.05, data not shown) between
each species. Mean dS values for each gene ranged from
0.008 for gene G to 0.152 for gene E. dS rates were significatively higher for gene E, compared with genes B (Wilcoxon test, W = 0, p = 0.002), D (W = 0, p = 0.003) and G
(W = 24, p = 0.013) at the 2.5% level. We observed the
same difference between gene I and genes B (W = 6, p =
0.023), D (W = 4, p = 0.018) and G (W = 0, p = 0.014).
These results are in agreement with the corresponding

observed topologies. Mean dN/dS ratios for each paralogous pair ranged from 0.03 for O. brachyantha to 0.77 for
O. punctata. Positive selection was tested between each
pair in all genes with a Z-test of selection. Benjamini&Hochberg-corrected estimates of p-values were
significant at the 0.05 probability level for three paralogous pairs: O. sativa ssp. japonica copies of gene B (dN-dS
= 2.440, p = 0.0101), L. perrieri copies of genes B (dN-dS
= 2.144, p = 0.02) and D (dN-dS = 2.049, p = 0.0261) and
P. parviflora copies of gene G (dN-dS = 2.869, p =
0.00254).
The K ratio, the rate of nucleotide substitution calculated
for orthologous non-coding sequences, is expected to be
higher than the dN value and approximately equal to the
dS rate, as non-coding sequences are also considered to
evolve without selective pressure. However, if mechanisms leading to homogenization of paralogous pairs
between both chromosomes 11 and 12 operate indiscriminately on both coding and non-coding sequences, we

lower than K values, the latter showing no difference in
paralogous and orthologous comparisons. Mean K values
between paralogs for each gene vary from 0.034 for gene
B to 0.247 for gene I, and seem to be correlated with the
different topologies observed. We compared these data
with divergence among the orthologs for each sequence. K
substitutions were lower for paralogs than for orthologs
for genes B (Wilcoxon test, W = 55, p = 0.003), D (W = 39,
p = 0.027), H (W = 78, p = 0.001) and I (W = 210, p = 4.7e5). The mean K value for all pairwise paralog comparisons
was approximately 0.1 and was significantly lower than
the mean K (0.1741) for all ortholog comparisons (Z-test,
Z = 6.32, p = 7.034e-9). For comparison, K values calculated for adh orthologs (1766 bp in introns, data set
extracted from Ge et al. [27]) varied from 0.035 (O. australiensis-O. alterniflora) to 0.338 (O. brachyantha- L. perrieri) with a mean of 0.185. We compared K, dS and dN
mean ratios between paralogs, except for genes E and I,
which present a topology of "duplication before speciation" type. Mean K was not significantly different from
mean dS (Z-test, Z = 1.3, p = 0.067) and mean dN (Z-test,
Z = 0.66, p = 0.106) at the 0.05 significance level. These
data are more in favor of a homogenized concerted evolution mechanism along the whole genes and confirm
results from Wang et al. [23], who described whole-gene
conversion for two paralogous pairs of this duplication
11-12 in O. sativa ssp. japonica subspecies.

would expect that the intron sequences diverge more
slowly between paralogs than between inter-species
orthologs. If these mechanisms apply only to coding
sequences, dN and dS rates between paralogs should be

Evolutionary dynamics of duplicated genes in O. minuta
In polyploid species, the evolution rates between duplicated copies are expected to change, either by accumulation of deleterious mutations in one of the redundant
copies, leading to pseudogenization, or accumulation of
positive mutations leading to neofunctionalization, or
possibly subfunctionalization. Four copies for each
sequence in the 11-12 duplication should be present in
the tetraploid species O. minuta, two from the B genome
and two from the C genome [27], except if gene loss has
occurred early in the diploidization process. Thus, genes
are three times redundant and we assessed whether this
redundancy can influence their evolution. We tested to see
(1) if we could detect accumulation of mutations and pos-

itive selection due to relaxed selection constraint or (2) if
concerted evolution also homogenized all the homeologous copies. We isolated 3 copies for genes D, E and H and
4 for genes B and I. The divergence rates of the tetraploid
copies were estimated by concatenating 5 sequences B, D,
E, H, I for O. punctata 1(BB), O. punctata 2 (BB) and O.
officinalis 2 (CC) (taking the single copy of O. officinalis for
sequence H), and O. minuta 1 and 2 (subgenome BB) and
3 (subgenome CC). This yielded a total data matrix of
4167 bp, including 1043 bp in exons. We calculated the
dN, dS and K ratios (Table 3) between each O. minuta
copy and its orthologs in the diploid genomes, between
the paralogous and paleologous copies themselves and,
finally, between the surrogate diploid progenitors.
Divergence (dN and dS) between O. punctata and O. officinalis copies on the one hand and O. punctata paralogs on
the other are very similar, which could be explained by the
close relationships between the two putative progenitors.
dS values between these two species in the MONOCULM1
region were also low [25]. dS and dN ratios between O.
minuta copies 1 and 2 (BB) were slightly lower than
between copies 1 and 3 and copies 2 and 3. We postulate

Synonymous (dS), non-synonymous (dN) and intronic (K) substitution
rates are indicated between the allotetraploid O. minuta combined
copies (from the five genes B, D, E, H and I), and their putative
orthologs in diploid progenitors (O. punctata and O. officinalis),
between the homeologous copies in O. minuta, and between the
diploid parental orthologous copies. Number of synonymous (Ns) and
non-synonymous substitutions (Nn) are indicated for the tetraploid
and its parental genomes, with Nipponbare as outgroup.

minuta1/O. minuta3 should be lower than between O.
punctata1/O. minuta1, O. punctata2/O. minuta2 and O.
officinalis/O. minuta3. Copies of the tetraploid and their
respective diploid orthologs displayed very low substitution rates, in particular for O. punctata and O. minuta. This
is more in favor of maintenance and parsimonious divergence of all the copies after the hybridization/polyploidization event than a concerted evolution of these copies.
Concerning the dN/dS ratio, positive selection was only
detected between O. punctata 1 and O. minuta 1 copies
(dN-dS = 2.307, p = 0.011). The O. punctata 2-O. minuta 2
pair presents a high dN/dS (3. 667), but the test was not
significant (p = 0.054).
To compare with the data of Lu et al. [25], we calculated
the number of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions in the tetraploid and its parental genomes, with
Nipponbare (copies 1 and 2) as outgroup (Table 3). Lu et
al. showed that both non-synonymous and synonymous
substitutions were in excess in O. minuta. Four of the 8
genes they tested had dN/dS >1 between O. minuta and
the diploid progenitors, revealing relaxed pressure of
selection in the tetraploid. The similar number of substitutions in the diploids and the tetraploids and detection
of positive selection for only one of the allotetraploid copies in the duplicated 11-12 fragment are in favor of concerted evolutionary dynamics.
Analysis of the duplicated region in Sorghum and
Brachypodium
The amplification of two copies for most genes we
selected in the 11-12 region, not only for species from the
Oryza genus, but also from the related Leersia perrieri and
Potamophila parviflora, was concordant with the recent
results of Paterson et al. [26]. These authors detected a
duplicated segment, also showing strong conservation, in
the corresponding regions of Sorghum bicolor chromosomes 5 and 8 and suggested that the duplication event
occurred before the cereal divergence. We used the
Artemis comparison tool (ACT, see Methods section) to
compare the 11-12 region with the sorghum chromosome
sequences and look for evidence of conservation of the
duplicated region in the new grass model species, Brachypodium distachyon http://www.brachypodium.org. BLAST
analysis indeed showed strong similarity between the 3
Mbp region on rice chromosomes 11 and 12 and a 4 Mbp
region on chromosomes 5 and 8 of sorghum. Surprisingly, there is a clear inversion of ~0.8 Mbp only on sorghum chromosome 8 between 1 and 1.8 Mbp which
corresponds to 1.2 to 2 Mbp on rice chromosomes 11 and
12 (Figure 5). Sequence comparison with the current
assembly of the 4× coverage of the Brachypodium distachyon genome identified only one contig, super-contig 7
(~17.7 Mbp). However, closer inspection showed that
these hits corresponded to two different regions of this

contig, the first 3 Mbp and the last 0.5 Mbp. ACT visualization of sequence conservation shows that the duplicated region at the end of the contig (beginning at 17
Mbp) is inverted compared with the sequences of chromosomes 11 and 12 (Figure 6).

Discussion
The rice genus underwent two episodes of rapid diversification [28] and thus rapid speciation which, with the fact
that the 11-12 subtelomeric region is highly conserved,
explains the poorly resolved internal node in some of our
trees. This leads to unclear phylogenetic relationships
between Oryza species and the outgroup Leersia perrieri, in
contrast to the observations of Guo and Ge [20]. Moreover, Leersia presents similar characteristics to O. brachyantha, which is on the boundary of the genus [29]. We
identified more than two copies of the H sequence for L.
perrieri, each sister to one Oryza species copy. L. perrieri
was identified as a diploid species (2n = 24) [30], and we
have obtained independent confirmation (A. d'Hont, personal communication). Two copies of Adh2 and Gpa1
were also isolated in this species [20], both of "Leersia"
type. These genes and gene H may have been duplicated
since the divergence of Leersia from the other Oryza
branches but more sequence information from this species is necessary to draw precise conclusions. While we
cannot exclude mechanisms of "birth and death" in the
generation of new gene copies elsewhere in the wild species' genomes, our approach, including amplification on
mapped BAC clones in all Oryza species, strongly suggests
that the gene copies are effectively on the orthologous
regions of these genomes.
Isolation of paralogous pairs in seven Oryza species and
two outgroups confirmed, firstly, that the duplication is
not specific to the genus and, secondly, that the gene
sequences are highly conserved between species. Wang et
al. [23] described a high level of concerted evolution in
this duplication in the two Oryza sativa subspecies,
japonica and indica, which they dated to 5-7MYA, but
showed that this conservation was heterogeneous along
the segment. Similarly, our analysis shows different phylogenetic topologies throughout the duplication in the
Oryza genus. All species display the same evolutionary
mechanisms for the first sequences on the duplication,
with a "duplication after speciation" topology. While we
cannot formally exclude independent duplication in all
species, widespread concerted evolution is the most parsimonious explanation. Paralogous pair divergence is similar, showing high conservation of the sequences. Even the
allotetraploid species, Oryza minuta, shows no evidence of
relaxed selective pressure, despite the putative presence of
four copies of each gene. This conservation throughout
the genus and in related species suggests that concerted
evolution in this subtelomeric region is a recurrent proc-

ess. Moreover our analysis of the K ratio between paralogous and orthologous copies indicated that the concerted
mechanism involved would occur on the whole genes,
and not only on the coding sequences.
Recently, Paterson et al. [26] described a duplicated segment in the corresponding regions of the sorghum
genome and suggested that the apparent segmental duplication in Oryza sativa resulted from the older pan-cereal
duplication. These observations and our results indicate
that we are no longer looking at the short-term evolution
of recently-duplicated genes, as has been suggested
[8,13,16,17], and that previous dating based on molecular clock calculations were biased by the weak divergence
rate. However, these authors describe a much larger conserved, duplicated region in rice and the exact extent and
degree of conservation remain to be determined. Our
results rather suggest that recurrent gene conversion is
probably limited to a relatively short region, with much
higher conservation in the immediate sub-telomeric
region and a gradient of sequence divergence. This may
explain the relatively high divergence times (17MYA for
rice/rice duplicates and 34MYA in sorghum) calculated by
Paterson et al. [26]
In this context, a similar duplication in the Brachypodium
distachyon genome is expected. Indeed, Oryza and Brachypodium both belong to the BEP (Bambusideae-Ehrhartoideae-Pooideae) clade, whereas sorghum belongs to the
PACC (Panicoideae-Arundinoideae-Chloridoideae-Centothecoideae) clade [31]. These clades diverged between
50 and 70 MYA [19], soon after the divergence of the
grasses. We identified two regions orthologous to the 1112 duplication on the first Brachypodium genome release,
confirming its presence in this species, although future
assemblies using deeper coverage will be needed to confirm the chromosome locations.

Gene conversion and unequal crossing-over events are the
mechanisms proposed to explain such a level of conservation after tens of millions of years, but more in-depth
genomic and cytological work would help to determine
the type and frequency of these events. An inversion
event, which constitutes a major chromosomal locus rearrangement, was detected on sorghum chromosome 8 and
potentially in one of the Brachypodium (end of the supercontig 7) duplicated regions. Inversions can be a source of
genomic novelties as well as sequence divergence [32] and
such an event in a region which has undergone concerted
evolution suggests that it is probably recent.
In the more proximal region of the duplication (genes F,
H and I), gene pairs appear to be less influenced by concerted evolution as we observed "duplication before speciation" topologies and isolated single copies for ancient

species. Moreover the neutral dS rate was stronger for
these genes. This could be explained either by divergence
of one of the sequences, making amplification of both
copies with primers designed on Oryza sativa impossible,
or loss of one copy, as for the majority of duplicated genes
in rice through the diploidization process [8]. A clear rupture in highly-conserved colinearity can be observed in
the dot plot of the 11-12 region in Oryza sativa (Additional file 1). Wang et al. [23] proposed a first model of
the distribution and order of crossing over events
throughout the duplication explaining the heterogeneity
in sequence similarity between japonica paralogs. We will
be able to extend this model to wild species with finer
genome analysis, but our results on gene H (L-Galactono,
4-lactone dehydrogenase) already suggest recent conversion events specific to two species (O. sativa and O. punctata).
Genetic recombination is influenced by chromosomal
location [33]. The subtelomeric location of the 11-12
duplication could be one factor explaining its evolution.
However, the subtelomeres of rice have rather been
described as dynamic regions where duplications have
spawned new copies of genes [34]. In agreement with our
observations, Wang et al. [35] recently described gene conversion occurring at a higher frequency towards the terminal regions of rice and sorghum chromosomes, showing
wholly converted genes at an average distance of 3 Mbp
from the telomeres in rice and a similar tendency in
homologous regions of sorghum. However, these calculations are biased by the over-representation of two duplicated regions, between chromosomes 3 and 10 and the
11-12 duplication, which represent between them 82% of
wholly converted genes and, to a lesser extent, high levels
of conversion in the orthologous regions in sorghum.
Rather than being a genome-wide phenomenon, these
observations suggest that as-yet unknown selective pressures have contributed to the maintenance of high
sequence identity within these two specific regions, and
particularly the 11-12 duplication.
Our results suggest the presence of two duplicated chromosomal fragments, currently found on all Oryza chromosomes 11 & 12, sorghum chromosomes 5 & 8, and
Brachypodium contig 7, which have been homogenized
through concerted evolution since the ancestral WGD,
dated after the Eudicot-Monocot divergence (between 150
and 200 MYA [36,37]). Wang et al. [23] proposed a stochastic evolution of gene pairs, in which conversion acts
as an occasional, sometimes frequent interruption to
independent evolution of paralogs. Our observations on
genes in the subtelomeric 11-12 region throughout the
Oryza genus and in related species, suggesting continuous
concerted evolution affecting the same gene pairs in
widely-divergent species, are not in agreement with this

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/146

hypothesis. As suggested above, they rather indicate
mechanisms acting preferentially in specific duplicated
regions, and most notably in the duplication between
chromosomes 11 and 12.

Conclusions
Our observations suggest recurrent but heterogeneous
concerted evolution has led to the extremely high
sequence conservation occurring in this region of more
than 2 Mbp. The detection of paralogous copies for
almost all genes in all the species studied indicates a specific mechanism which has led to conservation in this
duplicated region throughout the Oryza genus and in
related species. It will be interesting to compare detailed
structure of both distal ends of chromosomes 11 and 12
with other rice genomic regions (chromosomes 3 and 10).
More detailed comparative analysis will allow a clearer
understanding of the selection or structural pressure
which tends to conserve this particular region.

Methods
Species sampling and amplification
Among the 23 species of the genus Oryza, representing 6
diploid genome types and 4 allotetraploids, we included
6 diploid species; O. sativa japonica (AA), O. punctata (BB),
O. officinalis (CC), O. australiensis (EE), O. brachyantha
(FF), O. granulata (GG) and a tetraploid O. minuta
(BBCC). We also included two closely-related species,
Leersia perrieri and Potamophila parviflora. Information on
the samples used for phylogenetic reconstruction is displayed in Figure 1.

Translations of sequences annotated as coding sequences
from genes in the first 2.5 Mbp of chromosomes 11 and
12 were used to isolate informative paralogous genes on
the Nipponbare genome from the Rice Annotation
Genome database [38]. These sequences were aligned
with all O. sativa japonica cDNA sequences using TBLASTN
[39] at an e-value of 10-5 to select only genes for which
there is proof of expression. The corresponding coding
sequences were used to perform a BLASTN search against
the combined Oryza Map Alignment Project (OMAP [40])
BAC-end libraries. These libraries, representing 11
genomes of wild species in the Oryza genus, provide comprehensive coverage (at least 5×) of these genomes. Alignments with the most distant Oryza species were used as
targets for primer design, choosing primers which were
specific to the cognate genes on chromosomes 11 and 12
in the O. sativa genome and amplified no other target. We
designed 22 pairs of primers for amplifying orthologous
segments from all Oryza species, among which nine genes
were selected on the basis of copy number (only two copies for most pairs in diploid genomes; exceptions are
noted in the Results section), their distribution along the
conserved region and their length (minimum of 200 bp).

The presence of the genes on the orthologous chromosomes of the wild rice species was confirmed by amplification on DNA from BAC clones which have been
mapped by FingerPrinted Contigs and sequence comparison of BAC-ends to the orthologous chromosomes in the
Oryza species. Information on the nine paralogous pairs is
given in Table 1.
Sequences were PCR amplified in a 25 μl reaction comprising 5 μl GoTaq Tp5x buffer, 2.5 μl dNTPs (2.5 mM
solution), 0.20 μl GoTaq polymerase (5 u/μl), 0.65 μl of
each primer (10 μM) (See Additional file 5: Primers and
hybridization temperatures), 1 μl DNA, and 15 μl H2O.
PCR cycling consisted of 30 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 45 sec
annealing at each sequence annealing temperature (Additional file 5), and 1 min 30 sec at 72°C. All amplified fragments were cloned into the pGEM T-easy vector
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Plasmid DNA was
extracted with a ProMega (Madison, WI, USA) kit and
sequenced on both strands on an Applied Biosystems
(Foster City, CA, USA) ABI Prism 3130XL sequencer using
universal primers. To isolate all gene copies we cloned
approximately 10 to 20 clones for diploid species and 15
to 40 for the tetraploid O. minuta. Genbank accession
numbers for each sequences are listed in Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis
Sequences were first aligned with Muscle [41] then refined
manually in the data matrix using Seaview [42] and
Bioedit
http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/
BioEdit.html. Maximum parsimony analyses were performed on PAUP [43], using the Heuristic algorithm with
default parameters. Analyses were conducted either with
insertions/deletions included or with indels excluded and
recoded according to Simmons and Ochoterena [44]. We
used PhyML 3.0 [45] for maximum likelihood analysis
and the automated tool provided by the Datamonkey
webserver [46] for selection of the DNA substitution
model. For all the sequence data sets, the Hasegawa-Kishono-Yano (HKY85) model, which does not assume
equal base frequencies and accounts for the difference
between transitions and transversions with one parameter, was selected. Bootstrap support was estimated with
1000 bootstrap for both methods.

insertion polymorphism (DIPs). dS and K variation was
tested with a Wilcoxon test, with α = 0.05, and mean K
was tested with a parametric Z-test. Selective pressure
(dN/dS >1) was tested using a Codon-Based Z-test in
MEGA4, with all positions containing alignment gaps
eliminated in pairwise sequence comparisons. Significance levels were corrected for multiple tests (672 comparisons overall) for diploid analyses using the
Benjamini&Hochberg procedure [50].
Sequence analyses
Dot plots were carried out with the Dotter programme
[51] using default parameters. Syntenic regions were identified by TBLASTN alignment against Sorghum bicolor [26]
and Brachypodium distachyon (first public release, http://
www.brachypodium.org/) genomic sequences with a cutoff of e-15 using all CDS on the duplicated region (3 Mbp)
on chromosomes 11 (546 CDS) and 12 (548 CDS). Largescale sequence conservation was analysed using the
Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT [52]) to project BLASTN
alignments carried out on the Health Protection Agent
Double Act server http://www.hpa-bioinfotools.org.uk/
pise/double_act.html, after masking repeated sequences
with RepeatMasker [53]. Dot-plots on subsequences of 1
Mbp were used to detect small-scale rearrangements.

To characterize the matrix data set and the divergence of

Nei-Gojobori method [47] in MEGA4, with overall transition/transversion bias for each CDS also estimated in
MEGA4 [48]. We define the number of substitutions per
