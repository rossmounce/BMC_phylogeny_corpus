Abstract
Background: Dmrt1 is a highly conserved gene involved in the determination and early
differentiation phase of the primordial gonad in vertebrates. In the fish medaka dmrt1bY, a functional
duplicate of the autosomal dmrt1a gene on the Y-chromosome, has been shown to be the master
regulator of male gonadal development, comparable to Sry in mammals. In males mRNA and
protein expression was observed before morphological sex differentiation in the somatic cells
surrounding primordial germ cells (PGCs) of the gonadal anlage and later on exclusively in Sertoli
cells. This suggested a role for dmrt1bY during male gonad and germ cell development.
Results: We provide functional evidence that expression of dmrt1bY leads to negative regulation
of PGC proliferation. Flow cytometric measurements revealed a G2 arrest of dmrt1bY expressing
cells. Interestingly, also non-transfected cells displayed a significantly lower fraction of proliferating
cells, pointing to a possible non-cell autonomous action of dmrt1bY. Injection of antisense
morpholinos led to an increase of PGCs in genetically male embryos due to loss of proliferation
inhibition.
Conclusion: In medaka, dmrt1bY mediates a mitotic arrest of PGCs in males prior to testes
differentiation at the sex determination stage. This occurs possibly via a cross-talk of Sertoli cells
and PGCs.

Background
Genetic evidence has suggested that the dmrt1 gene is an
important regulator of male development in vertebrates.
In humans, haploinsufficiency of the genomic region that
includes DMRT1 and its paralogs DMRT2 and DMRT3
leads to XY male to female sex reversal [1]. In chicken and
other avian species Dmrt1 is located on the Z chromo-

some, but absent from W, making it an excellent candidate for the male sex-determining gene of birds [2,3]. In
the fish medaka (Oryzias latipes), which has XY-XX sex
determination, a duplicated copy of dmrt1, designated
dmrt1bY or DMY, on the Y-chromosome was shown to be
the master regulator of male development [4,5], similar to
Sry in mammals.

While all other known genes of the sex determination/sex
differentiation cascade from mammals appear to be conserved only in vertebrates, and Sry even only in the placental mammals and marsupials, dmrt1 is exceptional,
because it is a true homologue of the Drosophila doublesex
(dsx) and Caenorhabditis elegans male abnormal (mab-3)
genes. Both dsx and mab-3 are components of the genetic
cascade that regulates sexual development. They encode
transcription factors that control the expression of genes
involved in the realization of the male or female phenotype. On the protein level they share a novel DNA binding
motif, the doublesex and mab-3 homology (DM) domain
that has been characterized as an intertwined Zn-finger
[6]. The DM domain is also predicted for the proteins
encoded by the vertebrate dmrt genes.
Both the mab-3 and dsx encoded proteins bind to similar
DNA regulatory sequences of the control region of yolk
protein genes and control their transcription [7,8]. Both
regulate also the differentiation of sex-specific sense
organs [9,10]. Dsx controls the sex-specific expression of
Fibroblast Growth Factor, the dachshund and the bric-a-brac
genes, thereby regulating development of genital structures and male-specific pigmentation. Furthermore, dsx
modulates the response of cells of the genital disc to wingless and decapentaplegic signalling and in this respect regulates sex-specific growth and cell migration (for review
see [11]).
Contrary to the situation in invertebrates, where much
progress in the analysis of the biochemical function of
doublesex and mab-3 as well as the cellular developmental
biological effects has been made, such detailed information is still lacking for the vertebrate homologue. So far it
is only known that in fish, frogs, turtles, alligators and
chicken dmrt1 shows sexually dimorphic expression: it is
expressed at higher levels in gonads that develop towards
testes prior to sexual differentiation and continues to be
active in adult male gonads, while it is downregulated in
ovaries [12-18]. In mice Dmrt1 expression in the gonadal
primordium is gradually lost in females, but is strongly
upregulated during testes development and remains high
in the adult organ [13]. Mutant male mice that lack Dmrt1
have multiple defects in postnatal testes development and
are sterile [19]. On the cellular level the specific expression in Sertoli cells has attributed to Dmrt1 a function for
these cells in the adult testes, while the expression in male
germ cells in some studies remained enigmatic.
We have used the medaka to study the biochemical and
cell biological function of Dmrt1 proteins. This small
aquarium fish is comparable in its advantageous features
for gene function analysis to the zebrafish. In addition,
the duplicated version of dmrt1, the dmrt1bY gene, is the
male determining gene in this species, being the only

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/99

known master sex regulator besides Sry so far in vertebrates. Dmrt1bY is expressed in the pre-Sertoli cells of the
developing testes [18,20], consistent with its predicted
function to determine development of the testes from the
undifferentiated gonad primordium. In adult males, the
gene is co-expressed with its autosomal progenitor dmrt1
in Sertoli cells [4,12] which itself is not expressed at the
time of gonad differentiation. Beside these differences in
expression [18] there are also some differences in structure [20]. Although displaying a high identity at the
amino acid level (more than 85%), phylogenetic analyzes
have suggested that single amino acid changes could be
largely responsible for the establishment of dmrt1bY as the
male sex-determination gene in Medaka [20].
Interestingly, at the time of expression of dmrt1bY in the
male gonad proimordium shortly before hatching, at
stage 36, in both sexes PGCs migrate to the gonadal primordium where they actively proliferate in female but not
in males [18,21]. As the number of PGCs at hatching
roughly correlated with the inferred level of dmrt1bY
expression the hypothesis was put forward that dmrt1bY
may regulate PGC number [22]. The mechanisms how
dmrt1bY might exert this function in unknown. Also, the
the fact that the transcription factor Dmrt1bY, expressed
in Sertoli cells, could act on PGCs has not been addressed.
Here we show, using overexpression and downregulation
by antisense morpholinos that dmrt1bY is a negative regulator of cell proliferation that is involved in the male specific cessation of primordial germ cell proliferation prior
to testes differentiation in medaka.

Results
Dmrt1bY modifies cell cycle progression
Considering that the first difference seen in medaka
gonad development is a difference in PGC number due to
propagation of PGCs in females but not in males we
investigated whether Dmrt1bY plays a role in regulating
cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. To analyze
this, first mouse Sertoli TM4 [23] were transiently transfected with a Dmrt1bY:GFP expression construct under
control of the CMV promoter (Fig. 1B). GFP transfected
cells were used as controls (Fig. 1A). After 28–30 hours,
TM4 cells transiently expressing the Dmrt1bY:GFP fusion
protein (transfection efficiency 10 to 15%; Fig. 1C) exhibited a clear increase of cells in G2 phase (from 27 to 30%
cells in G2 phase in the controls to 52% in Dmrt1bY
expressing cells; Fig. 1C and additional figure 1A [see
Additional file 1]. Raw data and statistical significance are
shown in additional figure 1 [see Additional file 1]. While
for both, controls (GFP positive and negative cells from
the same plate) and dmrt1bY-transfected cells (GFP positive cells), the proportion of cells in S phase remained
constant (around 12–17%), the increased number of cells
in G2 phase was always balanced by a reduction of the

proportion of cells in G1 phase (57–59% down to 30%
respectively Fig. 1C and additional figures 1A and 1B) [see
Additional file 1]. Interestingly, also the GFP negative
(GFP-) cells from the cultures transfected with Dmrt1bY,
showed reduced but similar G2 enrichment as the
Dmrt1bY expressing GFP positive cells (Fig. 1D compared
to 1C and additional figure 1A compared to additional
figure 1B and 1D) [see Additional file 1]. Cells treated
with serum conditioned by cells overexpressing Dmrt1bY
did not display any change in cell cycle phase distribution
(data not shown). Similar experiments in fish A2 cells
revealed the same result [see additional file 1].
Taken together, these data suggest that Dmrt1bY affects
cell proliferation by arresting cells in G2 phase through
both a cell autonomous and a juxtacrine mechanism.
Dmrt1bY inhibits cell propagation in early medaka
embryos
To confirm the inhibition of cell proliferation by
Dmrt1bY observed in cell culture in an in-vivo situation
capped mRNAs encoding fusion proteins of GFP with
wild type Dmrt1bY (Dmrt1bY:GFP) or a version lacking
the DNA binding DM domain (ΔDmrt1bY:GFP) were
injected into embryos at the one cell stage (Fig. 2A and
2B). GFP RNA-injected control embryos showed exclusive
cytoplasmic fluorescence (data not shown). Dmrt1bYGFP fluorescence instead was observed preferentially in
the nucleus (Fig. 2D,2E and 2F). This shows that the
Dmrt1bY fusion protein was correctly translated and then
properly imported into the nucleus. Surprisingly,
although mutational analysis demonstrated the presence
of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the DM domain
of the zebrafish Dmrt2/Terra protein [24], our experiments show both cytoplasmic and nuclear accumulation
of the ΔDmrt1bY:GFP fusion protein, which lacks the
entire DM domain (Fig. 2B). This points to an additional
nuclear targeting mechanism for Dmrt1bY outside of the
DM domain.

To monitor for a possible proliferation effect, cell cleavages were followed from the 4 cell stage (stage 4) until
shortly after mid-blastula transition (MBT), around stage
11. Dmrt1bY:GFP mRNA was injected at concentrations
ranging from 5 ng/μL to 150 ng/μL. Doses below 10 ng/
μL had no effect, while intermediate (between 20 and 75
ng/μL) and high doses (100 to 150 ng/μL) led to cessation
of development at 90% epiboly/neurula stage and shortly
after MBT (stage 10–11) respectively. Intermediate doses
(20 to 75 ng/μL) induced developmental delay during
early development around the MBT stage (stage 11). In
embryos injected with high doses of Dmrt1bY:GFP, once
arrested shortly after MBT (stage 11), blastula cells
remained quiescent for 6–8 hours and then disintegrated
(Fig. 2C and 2C'). For ΔDmrt1bY:GFP neither intermedi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/99

ate nor high doses had any effects on embryo cell proliferation indicating that the Dmrt1bY effect on early embryo
cells is mediated by the putative DNA binding domain.
For cell cycle analysis, Medaka embryos were injected with
either low doses (20 to 30 ng/μL of Dmrt1bY:GFP mRNA)
or high doses (100 to 150 ng/μL of Dmrt1bY:GFP mRNA)
and analyzed at stage 10 and 13 respectively. For both
stages flow cytometry revealed a dramatic dose dependant
increase of cells accumulated in G2 phase upon Dmrt1bY
expression (Fig. 1E and 1F) that is balanced by a reduction
of the proportion of cells in S phase. This in vivo result
(Fig. 1E and 1F) corroborates the cell culture data (Fig. 1C
and 1D).
Dmrt1bY arrests cell proliferation modulates DNA
replication and can lead to apoptosis
To examine whether the inhibitory effect of Dmrt1bY
affects cell proliferation or causes cell death, one cell stage
embryos injected with high dose (Dmrt1bY:GFP, 150 ng/
μL) were allowed to develop until they stopped their
development at stage 10–11 (mid blastula). At that stage
apoptotic pathways usually become active [25]. Injected
embryos were stained for the mitotic marker phosphoHistone H3 (pH3) (Fig. 2G and 2H) as well as by TUNEL
assay for apoptosis [see additional figures 2A to 2F in
additional file 2]. High Dmrt1bY:GFP doses led to an
almost complete arrest of cell proliferation. Only 10 to
20% of the cells were positive for pH3, compared to controls, which displayed 70 to 80% proliferating cells (Fig.
2G and 2H). Embryos injected with intermediate doses of
Dmrt1bY:GFP (50 ng/μL) that are able to pass through the
MBT stage, were allowed to develop until late neurula
(stage 18) and analysed the same way. Cell replication status was lower than in controls (35 to 45% vs. 70 to 80%
pH3 positive cells). Analysis of apoptosis by TUNEL labelling revealed a statistically significant increase of apoptotic cells at the neurula stage (stage 18) [see additional
figures 2C, 2D, 2E and 2F in additional file 2]. Most of
these apoptotic cells were not in the embryo but were
located at its periphery or spread all over the yolk sac [see
additional figures 2E and 2F in additional file 2]. In summary, Dmrt1bY effects were clearly dose-dependent and
ranged from slowing-down cell proliferation rates and
delay in development up to complete replication stop.
Transgenic fish expressing Dmrt1bY show a delay in early
development
As mRNA injection experiments can produce excessively
high levels of a gene product in a transient way, we sought
for a system that leads to more physiological levels of
Dmrt1bY in early embryonic cells not interfering with
normal development. A transgenic line expressing the
Dmrt1bY:GFP fusion protein driven by the ubiquitously
active cytoskeletal actin promoter was established and

analysed for Dmrt1bY:GFP expression (Fig. 3). This transgenic line, however, does not show sex reversal, probably
due to the ubiquitous rather than Sertoli-cell specific
expression and generally low expression in later developmental stages of the dmrt1bY transgene.
In embryos of the transgenic line, after zygotic transcription starts at mid-blastula (stage 11), a ubiquitous accumulation of the fusion protein was observed. During early
neurulation (stage 17) GFP intensity reached its maximum. Interestingly this wave of Dmrt1bY:GFP protein
expression was clearly paralleled by a marked delay in
development for which the peak is also at early neurulation (stage 17) (Fig. 3). At the maximal Dmrt1bY:GFP
protein accumulation at 70–80% epiboly (early neurulation, stage 17), cell replication status was quantified using
pH3 staining (Fig. 4A,4B and 4C). While the spatial distri-

bution of pH3 staining was comparable for both, wild
type and transgenic embryos, a highly significant (p <
0.001) decrease of 25.5% in the number of replicating
cells was observed for the Dmrt1bY:GFP protein expressing embryos (Fig. 4A and 4B). This value in the transgenics (Fig. 4C) is similar to the value obtained in-vitro in
Dmrt1bY expressing cell lines (Fig. 1).
Differences in primordial germ cell number, shape and
replication pattern are diagnostic for the male and female
gonad anlage
Evidence has accumulated that the first appearance of
morphological sex differentiation in medaka is a difference in the number of germ cells between the sexes
[25,26]. Importantly, Dmrt1bY expression in the male
gonad correlates with the appearance of male/female
germ cell dimorphism. This first morphological sex differ-

ence is apparent as early as pre-hatching stage (stage 38)
[18], more than ten days before the somatic gonad is
formed [27]. Hence, taking advantage of the Olvas
medaka transgenic line [28], which expresses GFP under
control of the vasa promoter specifically in the primordial
germ cells, we investigated the possibility of sexing
medaka embryos as early as the hatching stage through
primordial germ cell number and shape (Fig. 5A,5B and
5C).
Just after hatching (stage 39), GFP-positive PGC number
in Olvas males was one half up to two third of Olvas
females (40 to 70 and 100 to 150, respectively) (Fig. 5A
and 5B). This is in accordance with the findings of Kobayashi et al. [18] and Hano et al. [29]. An additional criterion for discrimination was the shape of the area occupied
by the PGCs. This materializes as a large ovoid cumuluslike cloud shape for females (Fig. 5B); while being thinner
and more stretched (stratus-like cloud shape) along the
anteroposterior axis for males (Fig. 5A). Noticeably, at
stage 39, both sexes present a significant higher number of
PGCs in the right PGC lateral clump, although this is
more pronounced in females (Fig. 5A and 5B) [30]. Furthermore, individual primordial germ cells appear round
and compact in males, while being smaller and more "diffuse" in females. Altogether these criteria allowed predict-

ing sex of Olvas fish already shortly after hatching with a
reliability of 92.5% (n = 40) (Fig. 5C). In addition, at stage
39 (hatching), BrdU incorporation assay revealed more
replicating cells in female than in male (Fig. 6A and 6B).
Noticeably, this enhanced cell replication in female was
observed for both PGCs and the somatic surrounding cells
(Fig. 6C,D and 6E).
In order to test whether the morphology of the developing
gonad in Olvas transgenic fish correlates with expression
of a functional Dmrt1bY gene, the YAwr mutant strain was
used. In this strain dmrt1bY contains a nucleotide insertion in exon 3, resulting in a frame shift creating a premature stop at residue 139. Although this mutation is
connected to a male to female sex reversal in XYAwr and
YAwrYAwr fish [31,32], the underlying mechanism is
unknown and sex-specific germ cell numbers and arrangement was not reported. Offspring obtained by mating a
YAwrYAwr female with an Olvas XYHdrR male (Fig. 5D) containing the wild type dmrt1bY gene was analyzed according to the above mentioned criteria in order to determine
sex by PGC and primordial gonad phenotypes. Presence
of dmrt1bYAwr and/or dmrt1bYHdrR alleles was then assayed
by PCR using specific oligonucleotide primers (Fig. 5E).
This revealed that the PGC phenotype, like in wild type
fish, is determined by the presence (male) or absence

Down-regulation of Dmrt1bY shifts male primordial gonad
phenotype towards female
To this end the Dmrt1bY effect on cell proliferation could
be demonstrated in-vitro as well as in-vivo. However, to
verify that this function is of relevance for the gene's
action in gonad determination and development we
attempted to down-regulate dmrt1bY expression in developing embryos. Having the possibility of discriminating
male and female primordial gonads by GFP phenotypes
and BrdU incorporation at hatching stage, embryos were
injected with a dmrt1bY-morpholino at the one cell stage
and analyzed for gonad phenotype and genotype at hatching (stage 39) (Fig. 6 and 7).

In no case genotypic females were affected. In genotypic
males (n = 40), Dmrt1bY morpholino injection resulted
in mainly three phenotypes (Fig. 7A,7B1,7B2 and 7C).
Complete primordial germ cell phenotypic sex reversion
was observed for 17.4% of the males (Fig. 7C and 7D).

Another 19.5% of the males exhibited an intermediate
male/female PGC and gonad shape but made up of much
more primordial germ cells when compared to wild type
males (Fig. 7B1, 7B2 and 7D). The remaining 63.1%
males showed no gross abnormalities (Fig. 7A). In
injected embryos that were allowed to develop until adult
stage, no sex reversion of the gonad was observed.
It should be noted that the effect of Dmrt1bY morpholino
knockdown occurred exactly at the stage when dmrt1bY is
first expressed in the pre-Sertoli cells and when the first
difference in the presumptive male and female primordial
gonad become visible. BrdU incorporation showed that in
female and male-Dmrt1bY morpholino injected gonads,
many PGCs were labelled (Fig. 6A and 6F) while in genotypically male control embryos a lower number of BrdU
labelled cells were observed (Fig. 6B). The ratio between
male and female BrdU-labelled gonadal cells was 0.1 – 0.2
in non injected fishes. In fish injected with Dmrt1bY morpholino this ratio increased to 0.3 – 0.4, indicative of
higher proliferation rate. Similar results were obtained
when checking at cell replication using phospho-histone

higher replication status of the surrounding gonad mesoderm (Fig. 6C,D and 6E).

Discussion
From nematodes to mammals, evidence has accumulated
that dmrt1 genes are involved in sex determination
[9,19,32-34]. However, nothing is known how these
genes exert their function during gonad induction, differentiation and maintenance in vertebrates. Considering
the fact that in medaka like in many other fish [35] the

first sign of sexual differentiation is a lower number of
PGCs in male embryos has led to the obvious hypothesis
that Dmrt1bY regulates PGC numbers at the hatching
stage in males ([36] for review). A lower number of PGCs
in the gonad primordium of males could be due to a negative control of proliferation at one of the various check
points of the cell cycle, reduction of PGCs by apoptosis or
phagocytosis, or loss of PGCs through migration out of
the gonad primordium. Our results support the view that
medaka Dmrt1bY negatively regulates cell proliferation
through an arrest in the G2 phase. Graded ectopic expression of Dmrt1bY correlated with the degree of down-regulation of cell proliferation, up to complete arrest.

Apoptosis appeared to be a late consequence of Dmrt1bY
toxicity. However, the molecular mechanisms by which
medaka Dmrt1bY exerts its effect remain to be determined.
Dmrt1bY effects on cell proliferation in embryos were
only observed, when zygotic transcription had already
started after MBT. Combined with the apparent nuclear
localization this opens the possibility that Dmrt1bY may
be involved in regulation of genes that control cell proliferation. However, Dmrt1 transcriptional activity has not
been demonstrated in vertebrates yet, but has been established for the Drosophila doublesex and C. elegans mab-3
orthologues of Dmrt1 [8,37,38].
Medaka Dmrt1bY is exclusively expressed in pre-Sertoli
cells of the male primordial gonad at hatching stage as
well as in adult testes in mature Sertoli cells [18]. Thus, it
is possible that one early function of Dmrt1bY is to negatively regulate cell proliferation in the Sertoli cell lineage.
This would be responsible for Sertoli cell quiescence,
which is a hallmark of this cell type. Such hypothesis is
supported by the only other functional study on a dmrt1
orthologue from vertebrates: in dmrt1-/- mutant mice Sertoli cells show an abundant overproliferation [19].
Beside an obvious cell autonomous effect on the cell cycle,
also a non-cell autonomous, possibly juxtacrine action
was observed. This juxtacrine action correlates with the
observations of Shinomiya [27] showing that in Medaka
in XX/XY transplantation chimeras, XY somatic cells differentiate into male cells according to their sex chromosome composition and that in this environment XX germ
cells differentiate into male cells.
We have shown that already 10 days before somatic
gonadal dimorphism, sex can be diagnosed through both
primordial germ cell phenotype and somatic gonad replication rate just after hatching in live embryos. At this stage
the number of primordial germ cells is higher in XX
embryos than that of XY embryos [18,21]. Dmrt1bY has
been shown to be exclusively expressed in the PGC supporting pre-Sertoli cells [18]. Hence, during primordial
gonad formation, Dmrt1bY primary function could be to
regulate both supporting cell replication and primordial
germ cell proliferation via a non-cell autonomous mechanism. We have shown here that Dmrt1bY can act in a juxtacrine way to downregulate proliferation and that
Dmrt1bY-morpholino injection led to modulation of the
early "primordial gonad" phenotype, transiently shifting
male primordial germ/supporting cell phenotype towards
the female state. The transient nature of the shift from
male to female PGC phenotype at hatching stage after
Dmrt1bY morpholino injection is due to the limited stability of the morpholino and clearly indicates that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/99

Dmrt1bY action during male primordial gonad commitment is not strictly inductive but requires a prolonged
expression.
In medaka it has been demonstrated that XY supporting
somatic cells can initiate sex differentiation into the male
type regardless of the presence of coexisting germ cells
[39]. In addition, cell transplantations between blastula
embryos in medaka suggest that XY somatic cells produce
an environment that leads to the differentiation of primordial germ cells into male germ cells regardless of their
sex chromosome composition [27]. In this context, two
main functions can be concomitantly attributed to the
master sex determining dmrt1bY gene in testis development in medaka. First, because from embryo to adult,
continuous Dmrt1bY expression occurs specifically in the
Sertoli cell lineage [18] and cell autonomous differentiation of Sertoli cell differentiation has been observed in XY
gonads lacking germ cells [39], Dmrt1bY is likely to
induce the development and the maintenance of the Sertoli cell lineage in an autocrine manner like its mammalian counterpart Sry. Second, Dmrt1bY appears to be
responsible for the male primordial germ cell arrest from
the pre-hatching stage (stage 38–39) until 20–30 days
after hatching, likely via a juxtacrine mechanism.

Conclusion
The finding that Dmrt1bY downregulates primordial
germ cell proliferation already 10 days before somatic
gonadal differentiation, leads us to suggest that in XY
medaka males, Dmrt1bY driven PGC number regulation
as well as determination of pre-Sertoli cells is the primary
event by which the whole gonad (germ line and soma)
would be specified through a directional cross talk from
pre-Sertoli/Sertoli cells with PGCs. Then, at this stage, Sertoli cells would be inhibiting primordial germ cell proliferation in the male primordial gonad through juxtacrine
Dmrt1bY action.

Methods
Fish maintenance and breeding
Medaka were taken from closed breeding stocks of the
Carbio (Carolina Biological Supplies) strain and kept
under standard conditions. Medaka embryos were staged
according to Iwamatsu [40].
Immunochemistry, DAPI staining and proliferation
quantification
For antibody staining, embryos were staged and fixed
overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) at 4°C. After washing and dechorionation, they were dehydrated and stored in methanol at
-20°C. After stepwise rehydration in PBS embryos were
incubated in blocking solution (1% DMSO, 1% BSA, 1%
goat serum and 0.5% Triton X100 in PBS) for 1 hour at

Page 11 of 15

BMC Developmental Biology 2007, 7:99

room temperature. Anti-phospho-Histone3 antibody
(Upstate) was prepared in blocking solution at 1:100 dilution. Incubation with antibody was performed overnight
at 4°C. After extensive washes in PBS, embryos were incubated with a 1:200 dilution of goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibody in
1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS overnight at 4°C.
Embryos were then washed 3 times in PBS and the colour
reaction was developed using the ABC kit (Sigma) with
horseradish peroxidase and DAB as chromogen. Ten individuals derived from the same parents were examined at
80% epiboly (stage 17). Mean and SEM of H3 positive
cells were calculated. Differences between wild type and
transgenic fish were evaluated statistically by paired Student test.
Nuclear staining was performed with DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, 1 μg/mL final concentration) for 30
minutes and observed under a fluorescent microscope.
For the identification of proliferating cells that had passed
through S phase we used the 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine
(BrdU) labelling technique. For BrdU labelling, embryos
were incubated for 10–12 hours in 10 mM BrdU (sigma)
and 2% tween 20 in solution to permeabilize embryos.
Proliferating cells which had incorporated BrdU were
identified using specific antibodies coupled with Alexa
and observed under fluorescent microscope.
Cell death assay
TUNEL (terminal transferase mediated dUTP nick endlabeling) assay (ApopTag Peroxidase In situ kit, Chemicon) was used to assess apoptosis in wild type, dmrt1bY
RNA injected and transgenic fish embryos. Embryos were
staged and fixed overnight in 4% PFA in PBS at 4°C, then
washed in PBS/0.1% Tween 20 (PBT) and dechorionated,
dehydrated stepwise to methanol, and stored at -20°C.
After rehydration, embryos were permeabilized by proteinase K digestion, re-fixed in buffered 4% PFA, washed in
PBT and subsequently placed in equilibration buffer
according to manufacturer's instructions. After one hour
incubation at room temperature, equilibration buffer was
removed and embryos were then placed for one hour at
37°C in digoxigenin-labeled dNTP containing reaction
buffer and terminal transferase enzyme. Next, embryos
were extensively washed in stop/wash buffer and then 3
times in PBT and incubated overnight at 4°C in anti-digoxigenin peroxidase conjugate containing buffer. After 4
washes in PBT, digoxigenin-labeled dNTP incorporation
was detected with the peroxidase ABC Kit using DAB as
chromogen.
Production of transgenic fish
For generation of transgenic lines, the meganuclease system according to Thermes et al., 2002 was used. The I-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/99

SceI-pCSKa::Dmrt1bY::GFP plasmid was obtained by
replacing the cytoskeletal actin promoter driven reporter
cassette of pCSKaGFPS-I vector [41] with the
Dmrt1bY:GFP construct. Briefly, Dmrt1bY::GFP fragment
was obtained by cloning Dmrt1bY complete ORF [4]
(EcoRI/BamHI sites) into pEGFP-N1 plasmid. The resulting plasmid was cut with EcoRI/NotI and the
Dmrt1bY::GFP fragment was inserted into I-SceI-pCSKa
plasmid (EcoRI/NotI sites). Plasmid DNA was injected at a
concentration of 100 ng/μl together with the I-SceI meganuclease enzyme (0.5 unit/μL in 1 X I-SceI buffer),
through the chorion into the cytoplasm of the one-cell
embryo. Embryos were kept at 28.5°C until hatching.
GFP-expressing F0 fish were selected as putative founder
fish, raised to sexual maturity, mated to wild type partners
and tested for germline transmission. Sex ratio was not
affected.
RNA and morpholino injections
For RNA injection, Dmrt1bY and ΔDmrt1bY fused to GFP
were cloned into pCS2 plasmid (EcoRI/NotI sites). Deletion of DM domain for ΔDmrt1bY construct was achieved
by removing nucleotides 28 to 232 of the Dmrt1bY ORF
after PpuMI/StuI digestion and religation.

Capped RNA for injections was transcribed from linearized vectors using the SP6/T3/T7 m MESSAGE mMACHINE Kit (Ambion). One nL was injected into the
cytoplasm of one-cell stage Medaka embryos as described
[42]. For knockdown experiments, embryos were injected
with the morpholino RT1Y: 5'-TCAGACAAAAACATCCAAATCCAGT-3' directed against the Dmrt1bY 5' UTR.
The most efficient morpholino dose (450 ng/μl) was
experimentally determined and the specificity of the oligo
confirmed in control experiments. The non-overlapping
expression pattern observed for Dmrt1bY and Dmrt1a
transcripts during embryogenesis between hatching stage
up to 5 days after hatching [4,5,35,43] rules out a possible
cross-reactivity of the Dmrt1bY morpholino against
Dmrt1a. In addition, the morpholino target sequence in
dmrt1bY has 5 mismatches to the corresponding
sequence in dmrt1a [see additional file 3].
Determination of phenotypic and genotypic sex in OlvasGFP medaka
The Olvas-GFP medaka line [28] was provided by M. Tanaka. Homozygous Olvas-GFP fish were crossed either with
Hd-rR or Awr strain fish [5,44]. Phenotypic sex was determined according to both, number [18,26,29] and shape
of primordial germ cells (GFP positive cells) as well as
shape of the primordial gonad at stage 39 (day of hatching). Subsequently, identification of genetic sex in each
individual was performed by PCR analysis for dmrt1bY
presence or absence after genomic DNA extraction. The
dmrt1bY fragments from either both Awr or Hd-rR-specific

Page 12 of 15

alleles were amplified with diagnostic primer sets,
DMTYa: 5'-GGCCGGGTCCCCGGGTG-3'/DMTYd: 5'TTTGGGTGAACTCACATGG-3' and DMTYe: 5'-ACAGGTAAACCAGAAAAACTA-3'/DMT1l: 5'-AACTAATTCATCCCCATTCC-3' respectively. Phenotypic sexing reliability
(%) through primordial germ cell visualization was calculated by comparing GFP-primordial gonad phenotypes
with genotypes (presence or absence of functional
dmrt1bY).
Cell culture, transfection and flow cytometric analysis
Mouse Sertoli TM4 cells and Xiphophorus embryonic epithelial A2 cells were cultured as described by Beverdam et
al. [23] and by Kuhn et al. [45] respectively. Cells were
grown to 70–80% confluence in 6-well plates and then
transfected with 5 μg expression vector using GeneJuice
reagent (Novagen) as described by the manufacturer. Cell
suspension of Dmrt1bY mRNA-injected and control
embryos was achieved by manual dechorionation at stage
13. Cells were then fixed in 80% ethanol overnight at 20°C and then stained with propidium iodide (15 μg/
mL). Native cells were stained with Hoechst dye 33342 at
a final concentration of 15 microg/mL (by dilution from
trihydrochloride trihydrate stock at 10 mg/mL, Molecular
Probes, Eugene, OR) at 37 °C in the dark. Immediately
before measurement of a sample, propidium iodide (PI)
was added, likewise at a final concentration of 15 μg/mL
(by dilution from stock at 1 mg/mL, Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR). Univariate flow histograms were recorded
on an analytical, dual-laser equipped flow cytometer
(LSR, Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) using UV
excitation of the Hoechst dye and gating on vital cell via
PI exclusion. The resulting cell cycle distributions reflected
by DNA content were quantitated using the MPLUS AV
software package (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA).
All transfection/cell cycle experiments were repeated three
times and gave similar results. [data are shown in additional file 1].

Analysis of Morpholino efficiency and specificity. 25 pg of a construct
containing 557 bp of the upstream DMRT1bY region including UTR and
ATG, which drives a GFP reporter (fused in-frame with a DMRT1a
cDNA), were injected alone or in combination with 0.85 ng DMRT1bY
Morpholino into Medaka embryos at the one to two cell stage. Injection of
the DNA alone resulted in strong GFP expression (in 11/12 embryos;
arrows in A), which was significantly reduced in embryos coinjected with
the DMRT1bY Morpholino (weak GFP expression in 15/22 embryos).
GFP expression was not reduced, when a control Morpholino (directed
against the autosomal copy of DMRT1) containing five base pair changes
compared to the DMRT1bY sequence was coinjected with the DMRT1YGFP fusion construct (strong GFP expression in 15/15 embryos; arrows in
