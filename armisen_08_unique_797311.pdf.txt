Abstract
Background: Plant genomes contain a high proportion of duplicated genes as a result of numerous whole,
segmental and local duplications. These duplications lead up to the formation of gene families, which are
the usual material for many evolutionary studies. However, all characterized genomes include single-copy
(unique) genes that have not received much attention. Unlike gene duplication, gene loss is not an
unspecific mechanism but is rather influenced by a functional selection. In this context, we have established
and used stringent criteria in order to identify suitable sets of unique genes present in plant proteomes.
Comparisons of unique genes in the green phylum were used to characterize the gene and protein features
exhibited by both conserved and species-specific unique genes.
Results: We identified the unique genes within both A. thaliana and O. sativa genomes and classified them
according to the number of homologs in the alternative species: none (U{1:0}), one (U{1:1}) or several
(U{1:m}). Regardless of the species, all the genes in these groups present some conserved characteristics,
such as small average protein size and abnormal intron number. In order to understand the origin and
function of unique genes, we further characterized the U{1:1} gene pairs. The possible involvement of
sequence convergence in the creation of U{1:1} pairs was discarded due to the frequent conservation of
intron positions. Furthermore, an orthology relationship between the two members of each U{1:1} pair
was strongly supported by a high conservation in the protein sizes and transcription levels. Within the
promoter of the unique conserved genes, we found a number of TATA and TELO boxes that specifically
differed from their mean number in the whole genome. Many unique genes have been conserved as unique
through evolution from the green alga Ostreococcus lucimarinus to higher plants. Plant unique genes may
also have homologs in bacteria and we showed a link between the targeting towards plastids of proteins
encoded by plant nuclear unique genes and their homology with a bacterial protein.
Conclusion: Many of the A. thaliana and O. sativa unique genes are conserved in plants for which the
ancestor diverged at least 725 million years ago (MYA). Half of these genes are also present in other
eukaryotic and/or prokaryotic species. Thus, our results indicate that (i) a strong negative selection
pressure has conserved a number of genes as unique in genomes throughout evolution, (ii) most unique
genes are subjected to a low divergence rate, (iii) they have some features observed in housekeeping genes
but for most of them there is no functional annotation and (iv) they may have an ancient origin involving
a possible gene transfer from ancestral chloroplasts or bacteria to the plant nucleus.

Background
The role of gene duplications in evolution was suggested
forty years ago (see the review by Taylor and Raes 2004
[1]). More recently, complete sequencing of several
eukaryotic genomes showed the quantitative importance
of duplicated genes [2,3]. In particular, plant genomes
contain a high proportion of duplicated genes and, in several plant gene families, the number of paralogous genes
is more than one hundred [4,5]. Frequent gene duplications [6], occasional segmental [7], chromosomal and
genomic duplications [8-13] shaped present genomes.
The underlying mechanisms indicate that the primary
molecular events in gene duplication should affect most
of the genes independently of their function. Nevertheless, all characterized genomes include single-copy
(unique) genes, i.e. genes without apparent homolog in
the same genome [14] and, for some of them, without any
homolog, even in phylogenetically close relatives [15].
Indeed, evolution is not a one-direction process and a
high proportion of duplicated genes are rapidly lost
[6,16,17]. This definition of unique gene is fully independent of the gene function and is only based on the
protein sequence uniqueness in the whole proteome of a
considered species. For instance, in the framework of this
definition, the bHLH transcription factors, whatever the
different functions that might be assigned to each of
them, are not considered as unique because they all share
sequence similarity and, as such, are thought to have
arisen from a common ancestor. In other words, in this
paper we define as single-copy or unique gene, a gene coding for a protein without detectable sequence motif or global similarities with any protein in the same proteome.
Unlike gene duplication, gene loss is not an unspecific
mechanism but it is instead influenced by functional
selection [12,18]. Thus, duplicates that are maintained
show a bias toward certain gene functional classes [19] or
transcriptional level [6,20,21]. Unique genes may also be
duplicates that diverged too much to be distinguished
now [22]. With the recent availability of whole plant proteomes it is possible to consider further some questions
about the generation and evolution of unique genes in
plants. In many evolutionary studies, sound groups of
duplicated genes are selected but the genes left apart by
the process are far from being all unique genes. Indeed,
the potential adaptive significance of duplicated genes
and genomes has received great attention [23-25]. It is
however more difficult to speculate on the meaning of
species- or phylum-specific unique genes mainly because
of a critical lack of functional annotation for most of
them. Major differences in gene repertoire among species
were attributed to proteins with obscure features that lack
currently defined motifs or domains (POFs) and are often
species- or phylum-specific [26]. The definition of POFs
[27] relying only on the absence of characterized con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/280

served sequence signatures is thus independent of the
existence or absence of paralogs. POFs and unique genes
are nevertheless overlapping populations of genes.
Hypotheses on the possible origins of POFs include convergent evolution and rapid divergence [26]. The question
of the origin of unique genes, either purifying selection
against duplicates or rapid divergence, remains unsolved.
In this study we first established and used stringent criteria
in order to identify suitable sets of unique genes present
in the extensively known proteomes of Arabidopsis thaliana
(core eudicotyledons, Brassicaceae) and Oryza sativa (Liliopsida, Poaceae), two plants that diverged ~150 million
years ago (MYA) [28,29]. Second, we used the intersection
between the two sets of unique genes in order to characterize a set of genes conserved as unique in both A. thaliana and O. sativa, i.e. pan-orthologs as defined by Blair et
al. [30]. Third, we searched for gene, promoter and protein features shared between all unique genes and/or
within pairs of pan-orthologs. Fourth, using the panorthologs between A. thaliana and O. sativa, we searched
for their conservation in a green unicellular alga and a
moss, for which reasonably good proteomes are also
available. Within the limits of the proteomes used, we
show that several unique genes are species specific but
that a significant number are conserved even outside of
the green phylum. The clusters of homologous unique
genes highly conserved throughout the green phylum globally present specific structural features that indicate a
strong purifying selection supporting the orthology links
between the conserved unique genes. These conserved
unique genes would be important targets for functional
studies since it is likely that they perform ancient but not
described biological functions.

Results and discussion
How many unique genes in Arabidopsis thaliana and
Oryza sativa?
With the scope to search for possible evidence of particular features of the unique proteins, our method should be
stringent enough to deliver a minimum level of false positives. To achieve this objective we used a protocol that
mixed detection of conserved motifs (through the PFAM
library [31]), and local sequence alignments (BLASTp)
taking into account the relative length of the conserved
regions. A. thaliana and O. sativa were the first two plants
with a whole genome sequenced and annotated [4,5]. The
corresponding proteins have been used separately to run
our protocol for each species (Figure 1). In a first stringent
step, we removed 18,274 A. thaliana and 28,482 O. sativa
proteins tagged with the same PFAM motifs. In a second
step, remaining proteins were used as query sequence in a
BLASTp search [32] against their corresponding proteome. Proteins that returned a hit with an e-value higher
than e-10 were filtered on the basis of size ratio value of
the best alignment between both proteins. This third step

led us to consider as homologs, and thus not unique, proteins sharing low sequence similarities that are distributed
on more than 30% of the full-length protein. Following
this pipeline, we found 2,570 unique proteins in the proteome of A. thaliana and 8,041 unique proteins in O.
sativa, which represent 9.7% and 13.9% of the whole proteome respectively.
Previous published estimations of the number of A. thaliana unique proteins gave different values ranging from
3,405 to 12,265 proteins [4,33-35] depending on the protocol used. The smaller value (3,405) comes from the
PHYTOPROT project [34] and were obtained through
extensive all-against-all sequence comparisons using the
LASSAP software [36]. The list of unique genes delivered
by PHYTOPROT was longer than the list provided by our
method but 81% of the unique proteins were shared
between both lists. The expertise of additional proteins
identified in PHYTOPROT shows that they are members
of a PFAM family and, therefore, excluded from our list.
Unique proteins conserved and non-conserved between
Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa
One protein unique in a given species may have either no,
one or several homologs in other species. We named
U{1:0} the unique proteins in one species with no
homolog in the other one, U{1:1} the unique proteins
with only one homolog and U{1:m} the unique proteins
with more than one homolog. A 2-letter prefix was added
to indicate the plant species when necessary, i.e.
AtU{1:m} refers to A. thaliana unique genes with at least
2 homologs in the O. sativa genome. Both U{1:1} and
U{1:m} are conserved single copy genes in the reference
genome (thereafter called conserved single copy genes)
and are respectively qualified as pan-orthologs and synorthologs according to Blair et al. [30].

After sequence comparison based on BLASTp, 995 (3.7%
of the whole A. thaliana proteome) and 6,418 (11.1% of
the whole O. sativa proteome) unique genes were classified as AtU{1:0} and OsU{1:0} respectively (2).
Sequence conservation between the Liliopsida and core
eudicotyledon members of a pair of proteins is a strong
support for the gene prediction of U{1:1} and U{1:m}
genes. However, an over-prediction of U{1:0} genes
remained possible. Thus, we searched for proofs of transcription for the genes coding for the U{1:0} proteins in
both plants. We have found transcript sequences for 544
(out of 995) and 1,462 (out of 6,418) U{1:0} proteins
from A. thaliana or O. sativa respectively. This class of proteins for which the corresponding gene structure was sustained by transcript sequences (ESTs and/or cDNA) was
named U{1:0}E (for Expressed) genes. Similarly, the class
of unique proteins without homologs in the other plant

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/280

species and without cognate ESTs was named U{1:0}NE
(for No proof of Expression) genes (Figure 2).
In A. thaliana, we further analysed possible over-prediction of 451 AtU{1:0}NE proteins searching for corresponding gene expression in CATMA [37] and Affymetrix
[38,39] transcriptome resources. Statistical proof of
expression was found for 311 additional AtU{1:0}NE
genes. All together, these data indicated that most of the
predicted AtU{1:0} coding genes were expressed and thus
actual genes. It was more difficult to conclude on the accuracy of the number of unique genes for O. sativa since
there remained a large number of OsU{1:0}NE genes
(4,956) with not enough available transcriptome data.
Using the 2,570 A. thaliana unique proteins as query in a
BLASTp against the 8,041 O. sativa unique proteins we
found 974 pairs of AtU{1:1} proteins and 960 OsU{1:1}
when doing the inverse search. Of these genes, 937 shared
pairs remained as U{1:1}protein pairs after crossing both
lists. A manual check of U{1:1} protein pairs present in
only one list showed that differences were due to gene
splitting/fusions that may come from either actual events
or from gene prediction errors in one of the two genomes.
These processes changed an actual U{1:1} relationship
into an apparent U{1:m} relationship.
Topological organization of unique genes
Both A. thaliana and O. sativa have large regions that are
still recognizable as duplicated regions [4,40]. We analyzed AtU{1:0}, AtU{1:1} and AtU{1:m} gene distribution in A. thaliana non-duplicated regions, which
contained 15.7% of the nuclear genome. No significant
preferential occurrences of AtU{1:0}, AtU{1:1} and
AtU{1:m} genes were observed inside the apparently
non-duplicated regions, where we observed about 18% of
them. Therefore, this result showed that most of the genes
are unique not because they belong to a genomic region
deleted after whole genome duplication, but because of
the non-reciprocal local losses between two paralogous
duplicated genomic regions.

We also analysed the distribution of each class of unique
genes along A. thaliana and O. sativa chromosomes using
a Chi-square test with a confidence level of 99.5% (critical
values of 14.86 and 26.76 respectively). All gene classes
were evenly distributed among the 5 chromosomes of A.
thaliana with a Chi-square of 3.91 for U{1:0}, 3.95 for
U{1:1} and 0.63 for U{1:m} genes. The O. sativa distribution was also even for U{1:0} and U{1:m}, chi-square of
23.63 and 25.64 respectively, but unequal (Chi-square of
65.10) on U{1:1} genes. Detailed analysis showed that in
O. sativa genome there was a higher density of U{1:1}
genes in chromosome 2 and 3 and a lower density in chromosome 11 and 12. This particular distribution is unex-

Unique gene classification
Unique gene classification. Based on BLASTp sequence comparison, A. thaliana and O. sativa unique genes were classified
according to the number of homologs in the other species. We named U{1:0} the unique proteins in one species with no
homolog in the other one, U{1:1} the unique proteins with only one homolog and U{1:m} the unique proteins with more than
one homolog. First, a BLASTp between unique protein in each species and the whole proteome of the other species was used
to define U{1:0}, U{1:1} and U{1:m} gene groups. Proofs of transcription (presence of cognate ESTs and/or cDNA) were used
for further classification of U{1:0} genes in U{1:0}E (for Expressed) and U{1:0}NE (for No proof of Expression) genes. Red

pected since chromosomes 11 and 12 are the only two rice
chromosomes that do not show evidence for large
regional duplications with any other rice chromosomes
[40,41]. The recent duplication described between the
first 3 Mb of the chromosomes 11 and 12 [13,41,42] only
covers 11% of their size which is not sufficient to explain
the low number of unique genes observed within each
chromosome (60% of the expected number).
Thus, our results suggest that in O. sativa, as well as in A.
thaliana, non-reciprocal losses between duplicated
genomic regions are a frequent mechanism for generating
and maintaining unique a set of genes.
Unique gene and protein features
We compared the intron relative numbers, the presence of
some TFBS and the protein lengths between random sets
of nuclear genes and the 3 groups of unique genes,
U{1:0}E, U{1:1} and U{1:m}. All the U{1:0}NE genes
and the U{1:0}E genes not fully covered by cognate transcripts were not included in the study due to the uncertainty on their structural annotation (intron number and

positions, CDS size). The GC content of all the groups was
not significantly dissimilar to the 44.2% in A. thaliana and
the 53.3% in O. sativa.
Intron number
This feature separates all the unique genes into two distinct groups. On one side, U{1:0} clustered intron poor
genes that had 30% fewer introns than all nuclear genes.
On the other side, U{1:m} and U{1:1} genes have a
higher number of introns with a density of 1.35 and 1.57
introns per 100 amino acids as compared to 1.09 for all
the nuclear genes in A. thaliana (Table 1). These differences are the same for rice unique genes. Our results are in
agreement with the fact that, in general, evolutionarily
conserved genes preferentially accumulate introns [43].
Nevertheless, there is no difference in the number of
introns in the 5' and 3' UTRs between unique genes and
the whole genome. These observations suggest that the
pressure of selection that is at work to keep unique a set of
orthologous genes in a genome has an effect down to the
level of gene structures mainly in the ORFs. Indeed, functional reasons may be put forward since introns may play

a functional role through alternative splicing, effects on
gene expression [44,45] or by their involvement in protein transport [46].
Transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in promoter sequences
In the whole genome of A. thaliana and O. sativa we found
respectively 20% and 16% of genes with a TATA-box in
their promoters. Comparisons with the frequency of these
two well characterized TFBS present in promoters of
unique genes split them in two groups: the U{1:0} class
on one side and the U{1:m} and U{1:1} classes on the
other side. On one hand, the promoters of Arabidopsis
U{1:m} and U{1:1} genes contains the same relative
number of TATA-box (Chi-squared test, P-value = 0.40)
and they have a significantly lower frequency of TATA-box
(Chi-squared test, P-value = 2.3e-14) than the other
nuclear genes (Table 1). On the other hand, TELO-box
presence was significantly higher in AtU{1:m} and
AtU{1:1}genes than in the other nuclear genes (Chisquared test, P-value = 0.0057). The same differences are
observed in unique O. sativa genes (Table 1). The two
other TFBS analysed, SORLIP2 [47,48] and CAAT [49]
boxes, present slight variations in each class when compared with whole genome distribution, but these variations were not consistent in both species (Table 1). The
different frequencies of TATA and TELO boxes observed in
the promoter sequences of unique genes cluster them as
the intron density criteria: the class U{1:0} on one side
and the two classes U{1:1} and U{1:m} on the other side.
This particular clustering conserved in both A. thaliana
and O. sativa is discussed below.

Protein length
We compared the size distribution of each group of
unique proteins in the two species (Figure 3). On average,
unique genes coded for shorter proteins than the whole
genome. This is particularly evident for U{1:0} genes in
both A. thaliana and O. sativa showing a mean length and
a size distribution of the proteins smaller (Wilcoxon test,
P-values < 2.2e-16) than in the other classes of unique
genes (Figure 3). Indeed, the median size of the not
unique A. thaliana proteins is 352 aa while the median
value for the U{1:0}E proteins is only 107 aa, i.e. about
70% smaller (Table 1). While the displacement of the size
distribution of unique genes towards the small values was
shown in both plant genomes studied, it was less important in U{1:1} and U{1:m} proteins but still significant
(Wilcoxon test, P-values < 1e-14). The size distribution of
these two groups of conserved single copy genes had a
maximum around 150 aa and is localized between the
size distribution of U{1:0} proteins and the size distribution of the whole proteome (Figure 3). We may expect
that the number of conserved single copy genes will
increase in the near future since more genes coding for
short polypeptides will be added to genome annotations.
Indeed, the ab initio prediction of short ORFs is difficult
[50-52] and recent results in A. thaliana show that a part
of the drop in the size distribution of annotated gene
products below 100 amino acids [53] may be due to the
rejection by the annotation processes of several small
ORFs that turned out to be transcribed and/or under purifying selection [54-56]. Similar situations have been
reported in mouse, yeast and drosophila where experi-

unique genes and 995 do not have a homolog in O. sativa.
Conserved single copy genes are both the 974 A. thaliana
genes that have only one ortholog and the 601 genes that
have more than one homolog in O. sativa. In O. sativa
genome, 8,041 genes are unique and 6,418 do not have a
homolog in A. thaliana. Furthermore, 960 conserved
unique genes have only one ortholog while 663 have
more than one ortholog. Even if we might suspect some
over-prediction of unique O. sativa genes, our results
about the common features shared by unique genes are
highly similar in both A. thaliana and O. sativa. First, conserved single copy genes (U{1:1} and U{1:m} classes)
have relatively more introns than in the whole genome
and their promoter is characterized by a lower presence of
TATA-box and a higher presence of TELO-box than in the
nuclear genes. Second, unique genes code for shorter proteins than the whole genome and the difference is the
highest for unconserved proteins.
Functional features of U{1:0} genes
We recovered the annotated gene functions available for
the 544 AtU{1:0}E. Despite the fact that we used "annotation" in the largest acceptation of the word, only 105 of
them have a predicted function (Table 2), i.e. 2 to 3 times
less than expected from the whole genome [60]. In the
105 annotated AtU{1:0}E genes we observed 15 genes
coding for recognized peptide phytohormones [61]
including CLAVATA3 and 5 CLAVATA3 related peptides,
POLARIS, 3 PROPEP, RALF and N Hydroxyprolin-rich
glycoprotein coding genes. The small peptide phytohormones are involved in signalling roles in defence or nondefence functions [61] Most of the peptide phytohormones are proteolytic products of larger propeptides
encoded by different genes. Some peptide phytohormones may be clustered based on short motif conservation such as CLAVATA3 group which is characterised by
only 12 residues while the remaining parts of the propeptides are highly divergent. When we searched for peptide
phytohormones in AtU{1:1} genes, we did not find any

even though there were almost 6 times more genes with
predicted functions compared to AtU{1:0}E genes.
Another specific feature of the AtU{1:0}E group is to
exhibit a relatively high percentage of genes coding for
proteins targeted at the endoplasmatic reticulum (Table
2) as pro-peptides coding for secreted peptide phytohormones [61]. This observation suggests that the AtU{1:0}E
group might contain many other not yet characterized
genes coding for pro-peptides phytohormones and that
might be involved in unknown signalling processes. For
instance in the AtU{1:0}E group, we found 13 genes coding for proline or glycine rich-proteins that were mainly
predicted to be targeted at the endoplasmic reticulum
(Table 2). Additionally, genes encoding for secreted peptides have been reported as having a low intron density
[53] as we observed for the U{1:0} group of genes.
Structural and functional features conserved in At and
OsU{1:1} gene pairs
The 937 pairs of U{1:1}genes between A. thaliana and O.
sativa were established on local sequence comparisons
(reciprocal best hit or RBH) of U{1:1} gene lists with criteria generally accepted to define an orthology relationship [62]. Nevertheless, to support more strongly the
orthology and the functional relationships, we looked for
some structural features shared by the two members of
U{1:1} pairs (see Additional file 1).
Protein length
Protein lengths of the two members of a U{1:1} pair were
highly correlated (Figure 4A) and the slope of the correlation was close to one. Indeed, 456 (49%) out of the 937
pairs had proteins with length differing by less than 5% of
the total length. This high conservation in protein length
between the proteins of a U{1:1} pair was also illustrated
by the fact that in 526 pairs (56%) the difference between
the two proteins was less than 20 amino acids. Nevertheless, a small number of U{1:1} pairs were more divergent
with, for instance, 77 pairs (8%) showing differences in
the protein lengths equal to or higher than 30%. We
examined the 24 pairs exhibiting a length difference
higher than 200 amino acids, and in 16 cases, the difference could be explained by errors in the predicted gene
model of one of the two genes. In 4 out of 16 pairs we
found an artifactual fusion or splitting of neighbour genes

(Figure 4B) and in 12 out of 16 pairs the difference was
due to an erroneous gain or loss of exons (Figure 4C) in
one of the two species.
Intron position
The conceptual position of introns has been searched in
the global alignment of each pair of protein sequences.
Nearly 45% of U{1:1} pairs had conserved number and
positions of introns, while the mean value for random
pairs of conserved unique genes was 0.2% (Table 3). Less
stringently, 71% of the U{1:1} pairs exhibited at least one
intron at a conserved position as compared to 10.6% in
the random pairs. Overall, the high intron conservation is
strong evidence for orthology between members of a
U{1:1} gene pair, discarding any mechanism of convergence between their sequences. Comparison of gene structures in the U{1:1} pairs also highlights the fact that, since
the speciation, the numbers of intron gains or losses are
nearly equivalent in the two species. Indeed, the ratio
between the number of not conserved introns (in terms of
position) in A. thaliana and the number of not conserved
introns in O. sativa is 1.03 (Table 3). Comparative studies
on A. thaliana and O. sativa genes showed three different
evolutionary trends based on the orthology relationships.
First, recent duplicated genes are submitted to high loss
and gain of introns [63], second, two orthologous genes
tend to keep the same gene structure and only a relatively
small number of species-specific introns are observed [64]
and, third, slowly evolving conserved genes are also subject to an elevated rate of intron gain but tend to conserve
their introns [43]. As a consequence, there is a negative
correlation between density of introns and sequence evolution rate of genes [43]. The density and the high conservation of intron positions in conserved unique genes,
U{1:1}, suggests that these genes are orthologous and
slowly evolving genes.

Transcription
The methods available to compare the expression of
orthologous genes from different species are limited.
Since A. thaliana and O. sativa benefit from large collections of EST and cDNA sequences, we used the number of
available cognate transcripts of each member of a U{1:1}
pair to estimate and compare their expression levels. In
order to avoid sampling bias, we focused our comparison
on genes with at least 30 cognate transcripts. Retrieved
information showed genes with at least 30 cognate transcripts are in similar proportion in the population of
U{1:1} genes as in the whole genome whatever the considered species: 14.6% and 17.3% respectively for A. thaliana and 7.2% and 10.1% respectively for O. sativa. A
correlation (Kendall's test, P-value = 1e-6) between the
normalized numbers of transcripts in A. thaliana and O.
sativa could be observed for U{1:1} pairs (Figure 5A). We
compared this result with the correlation obtained with a
random set of gene pairs having a maximum size difference of 20 amino acids to reflect U{1:1} size proximity.
The random set contains ten times more gene pairs to
compensate for the fact that associating not orthologous
genes increases the chance of having at least one gene in
the pair with less than 30 ESTs/cDNA. No correlation
between the numbers of ESTs within the random set (Kendall's test, P-value = 0.26) was found (Figure 5B). Gene
expression and evolutionary rate have been shown to be
correlated in the genomes of different species [21,65,66]
including plants [67]. Our results showed that this correlation held true for the limited set of conserved unique
genes in A. thaliana and O. sativa. Indeed, similarities
inside U{1:1} protein pairs coming from highly transcribed genes, i.e. with at least 30 cognate transcripts, were
higher than similarities in the lowly transcribed U{1:1}
pairs (Figure 5C). Therefore, the features expected for
genes responsible for the same biological function, i.e.
conservation both in sequence and in level of transcription as well as the positive correlation between them, are

Expression levels correlated between genes of U{1:1} pairs. Expression level correlation based on the number of transcripts (ESTs/cDNA) associated to U{1:1} gene pairs (A) and randomized nuclear gene pairs (B). Values were first normalized
to take into account the size of the transcript resources in each species, the number of genes with a transcript and the total
number of genes on each species, and then transformed by base 10 logarithm. We used only the gene pairs with a size difference between proteins equal to or smaller than 20 aa (526 U{1:1} and 8,390 randomized pairs). The green line represents the
linear correlation for pairs of genes with at least 30 cognate transcripts (white area). U{1:1} genes pairs: r2 = 0.51 and Kendall's

strongly observed between genes in U{1:1} pairs indicating their pan-orthology.
TFBS conservation
In the previous section, we showed that conserved unique
genes have less frequently a TATA-box and more frequently a TELO-box in their promoters than the other
genes. Nevertheless, the general over-representation of
one TFBS in the unique gene promoter set does not mean
that TFBS are conserved in the two promoters of panorthologs. Therefore, we searched for the number of
simultaneous TATA-box or TELO-box presence on both
promoters of each U{1:1} gene pair. Surprisingly, the percentage of pan-orthologs that presented a TATA-box motif
within both promoters was only 0.8% and is not significantly different (Chi-squared test, P-value = 0.13) than the
expected value, i.e. the value observed in promoters of
randomly selected pairs of genes (0.4%). In contrary, the
simultaneous presence of a TELO-box motif within both
promoters of a U{1:1} pair was significantly higher (Chisquared test, P-value = 5.22e-5) than found in random
pairs (3.8% compared to 1.6%). In order to complete the
promoter comparison between A. thaliana and O. sativa
pan-orthologs, we used the CONREAL [68] and CREDO
[69] packages to find any other conserved motifs, i.e.
known or not known putative TFBS. This phylogenetic
footprinting approach did not highlight a promoter
sequence conservation different than that detected in random pairs of promoters. Additionally, the global analysis
of all pan-ortholog promoter pairs with Motif sampler
[70] failed to discover over-represented motifs excepted
the previously identified TELO-box. Thus, contrary to our
observation of conserved features in the CDS, we found
almost no trace of sequence conservation within the promoters of U{1:1}gene pairs even if our dataset of panorthologs might be regarded as the best situation to see
common regulatory sequences in A. thaliana and O. sativa
promoters. Nevertheless, promoter pairs of pan-orthologs
might share conserved TFBS (not over-represented in the
unique gene population) which we cannot distinguish
from background noise through the comparison of two
sequences.

In summary, conserved genes maintained unique in both
A. thaliana and O. sativa have (i) clearly a common origin
as indicated by the conservation of the intron positions
and the conservation in their product lengths, (ii) no
apparent conservation between their promoters which
contrasts with (iii) a conservation in their relative transcription level. Nevertheless, the number of ESTs that may
be associated to a gene is a general indication of the level
of transcription but it is a mixed measurement that is
dependent on both high expression in specific situations
and expression in a large range of conditions. Transcriptome data from DNA chips inform better on the breadth
of expression. Analyses of large transcriptome data collections have shown that A. thaliana genes responding to
many stimuli are frequently characterized by the presence
of a TATA-box, shorter CDS and fewer introns [71,72].
Conversely, A. thaliana genes controlled by TELO-box
have a narrow stimuli response and tend to be larger and
have more introns [71]. In this context, the conserved single copy genes, which rarely contain a TATA-box and are
relatively short genes containing more introns, might constitute a group of genes quite apart in the whole genome.
Are unique A. thaliana and O. sativa genes conserved as
unique in other plants?
We extended our study to other genomes for which our
knowledge was not as complete as for the A. thaliana and
O. sativa ones but, nevertheless, with a relatively complete
proteome available. Thus, we systematically searched,
with our approach, for unique proteins in the available
proteomes of Ostreococcus lucimarinus and Physcomitrella
patens [73,74]. The nearly complete proteomes of Populus
trichocarpa [75] and Vitis vinifera [76] were not used in our
phylogenetic analysis in order no to distort our results by
an overrepresentation of the core eudicotyledon branch.
Two by two comparisons of the unique proteins from the
4 studied species showed that the number of U{1:1} pairs
decreased with the evolutionary distance separating the
plants. However, the numbers of the observed U{1:1}
pairs were always significantly above the number expected
by chance (Figure 6). There are about the same number of
U{1:1} pairs, ranging from 477 to 503, between O. luci-

Unique gene conservation in the plant kingdom
Unique gene conservation in the plant kingdom. Study of unique gene conservation through evolution of Arabidopsis
thaliana (Brassicales), Oryza sativa (Poales), Physcomitrella patens (Funariaceae) and Ostreococcus lucimarinus (Prasinophyceae).
Unique genes of each species were characterized (number below species name, total nuclear genes between brackets) and
orthology relationships between couples of species were established using the previously described protocol. Phylogenetic
conservation of unique genes was analysed from O. lucimarinus (orange line) and A. thaliana (blue line) discarding not conserved
unique genes on each node (evolution distance showed in millions of years [28,29,74,78,79]. Remaining genes in each case were
compared to eliminate inconsistencies and obtain a final list of 192 unique genes conserved as unique in the four species:

whatever their total number of proteins (ranging from
26,541 to 57,915). This result suggests that any of the
multicellular plant genomes conserved about 500 of the
unique 2,691 genes present in the unicellular O. lucimarinus genome. Globally, 53% of the 2,691 O. lucimarinus
unique genes are also present in all or all but one species
and 18% of the O. lucimarinus unique genes are also
present in P. patens but not in the core eudicotyledon and
Liliopsida plants used in the comparison. Similar results
are obtained for A. thaliana unique genes with 48% of the
unique genes present in all or all but one species, and 22%
of A. thaliana unique genes only found in O. sativa.

The phylogenetic studies of unique gene conservation
from O. lucimarinus to A. thaliana provided a final list of
192 unique genes, the intersection between the two lists
(200 and 209) provided by comparisons going in the two
opposite directions (Figure 6). We named as U{1:1:1:1}
these genes conserved as unique in the 4 studied species.
The 192 U{1:1:1:1} genes constitutes a particular subset
(genes maintained as single copy in every studied species)
of the 4,177 A. thaliana core genes defined as conserved in
all plants by Vandepoele and Van de Peer [77]. The
expected number of U{1:1:1:1}genes, if we assumed a
random conservation between O. lucimarinus and A. thaliana, was only 8.38 genes (Methods section). The 192

genes present in all the studied species came from a common ancestor about 725–1,150 MYA [78,79] and have
been conserved as unique in all the species despite numerous local and segmental duplications expected to have
occurred during this long period of time [76]. In comparison, Zimmer et al. [78] have defined 26 pan-ortholog
clusters but they have also considered Cyanidioschyzon
merolae and Pinus taeda data and allowed for the exception
that a single species might contain paralogs.
Structural features of U{1:1:1:1} genes showed a mean
protein length and exon number similar to features in
U{1:1} genes as well as the same tendency towards a low
TATA-box and a high TELO-box presence in promoters.
These characteristics suggest that unique genes underwent
the same kind of selection pressure from the common
ancestor to the present organisms. An estimation of this
pressure was obtained by calculating the synonymous and
non-synonymous substitution rates (dN and dS) with
Nei-Gojobori's method [80] included in the Codeml program from the PAML package [81]. Each gene within a
cluster of U{1:1:1:1} genes was paired and compared to
every other gene included in the cluster (Table 4). Additionally, the dN/dS rate was computed for U{1:1} gene
pairs. Results showed a high selective pressure against
non-synonymous substitutions with a median dN/dS
ratio of 0.32 for the 937 U{1:1} genes and from 0.25 to
0.41 for unique genes conserved among the three land
plants and with a maximum median of 0.79 for pairs
including O. lucimarinus (Table 4). In comparison, we
observed that the median dN/dS ratio calculated from
7,551 alignments of putative A. thaliana – O. sativa orthologous proteins (RBH, Methods section) is 0.33. One dN/
dS ratio of 1 is usually considered as the limit between a
negative or a purifying selection (a drift being equal to 1
and a positive selection being higher than 1) [82,83].
Thus, our results show purifying selection pressure onto
conserved unique genes in plants and strongly suggest
that most of these genes are actual functional panorthologs.

base in order to define the range of conservation in other
branches of the tree of life. Our results show that 26% of
U{1:1:1:1} genes were specific to plants, 13% were conserved in plants and bacteria, 43% could be found in both
plants and metazoa, and 18% were conserved in all
plants, bacteria and metazoa phyla. This phylogenetic
profile shows that 74% of U{1:1:1:1} genes were highly
conserved not only in plants but also in other life phyla.
This situation implies an ancient origin of these genes and
increases the probability for a critical function promoting
their conservation. However, no evidence of shared or
similar functions can be found in the fraction of
U{1:1:1:1} proteins for which functional information has
been inferred from sequence homologies. The fraction of
unique conserved genes with a functional annotation, i.e.
60%, is the same as in all A. thaliana nuclear genes [60]. In
order to get information about function and origin of
unique plant genes, we explored the predicted subcellular
localization of the proteins according to their phylogenetic profile (Table 5). This work was based on the analysis of the 937 U{1:1} proteins since the 192 U{1:1:1:1}
proteins constitute too small a set to obtain statistically
robust results. Compared to 20,000 random A. thaliana
nuclear genes, the unique plant genes having homolog(s)
only in bacteria frequently encode plastidial proteins
since 49.1% of them have a predicted targeting peptide
specific to chloroplasts (Table 5). We observed the same
tendency within the 192 U{1:1:1:1} proteins. This significant bias (Chi-squared test, P-value = 1e-5) suggests that
a large part of the subset of unique conserved plant genes
may come from DNA transfer from the chloroplast to the
nuclear genome. Horizontal transfer from bacteria to
plant genome can also explain a fraction of this gene subset. This gene transfer probably predated the speciation
between Liliopsida and core eudicotyledons for the concerned U{1:1} genes and is close to the root of the plant
phylum for the group of U{1:1:1:1} genes. Our results
suggest that, after their transfer to the nucleus, these genes
have been submitted to a strong selection pressure that
conserved them as unique. This hypothesis is more parsimonious than many independent gene transfer events in
each concerned plant species. In their 26 clusters of panorthologs, Zimmer et al. [78] also suggest a DNA transfer
from organellar genome, mainly from mitochondria. Our
observations on the U{1:1} gene population showed that
transfer from mitochondria was also significant (Chisquared test, P-value = 0.0002) but less important than
from chloroplasts (Table 5).
A second subset of U{1:1} genes with homologs in metazoa (including fungi) must have been conserved from
ancient eukaryotic cells through the entire phylum and
probably has a critical function. Ancient origin, low divergence rate, presence of TELO-box and dearth of TATA-box
(Table 5), suggest that they are, or are related to, house-

Phylum conservation of 937 U{1:1} genes and 20,000 random nuclear genes was obtained by BLASTp of conserved unique A. thaliana proteins
against the Uniprot database. Gene number (column 1) shows the relative number of genes with a sequence similarity suggesting homology in
different phyla. Subcellular localization (column 2–4) was retrieved from the FLAGdb++ database. ER means Endoplasmic Reticulum. Promoter
regions of the A. thaliana genes were analysed for the presence of TATA (column 5) and TELO (column 6) boxes as previously described in Table 1
and the Methods section.

keeping genes [47,84] but no evidence could be retrieved
from the Gene Ontology annotation due to the high
number of unclassified genes. This metazoan conserved
subset represents 28% of the 937 U{1:1} genes but, interestingly, this fraction increases to 43% in the 192
U{1:1:1:1} genes.

Conclusion
We defined 2,570 and 8,041 proteins as unique in A. thaliana and O. sativa respectively. Unique proteins, products
of unique (or single-copy) genes, are proteins with no
sequence motif shared by any other protein in the same
species. A. thaliana unique genes can be further classified
according to the number of orthologous genes found in
O. sativa genome or vice-versa. Final classification
included: 451 AtU{1:0}NE, 544 AtU{1:0}E, 974 At
U{1:1}, 601 AtU{1:m}, 4956 OsU{1:0}NE, 1462
OsU{1:0}E, 960 OsU{1:1} and 663 OsU{1:m} genes
(2).
Unique genes are distributed all over the genomes including regions with evidence for segmental duplication and
suggesting that unique genes have been created by nonreciprocal local losses between two paralogous duplicated
genomic regions. These non-reciprocal losses may have
been directed by a selective pressure according to the
structural features present in unique genes conserved in
the two species (U{1:1} and U{1:m} genes). These specific features are a relatively small protein size and a high
intron density that have been described as evidence of a
slow evolution rate [43]. From a functional point of view,
unique conserved genes are characterized by a rare occurrence of TATA-box and a high occurrence of TELO-box in
their promoters suggesting that unique genes could be

linked to critical housekeeping functions such as protein
catabolism and synthesis, RNA processing or DNA repair
[47,71,84]. These results differ from previous observations which showed that genes involved in transcription
regulation and signal transduction tend to be more duplicated [12,85]. Additionally, even if unique genes have
been conserved in plants, no significant over-representation of TFBS related with photosynthesis or light regulation processes, such as SORLIP2 and CAAT boxes, have
been found in A. thaliana and O. sativa (Table 1).
Unlike conserved single copy genes, the A. thaliana and O.
sativa U{1:0} genes exhibit a low intron density, a normal
presence of TFBS in their promoters, and they encode for
proteins about 2.5 times shorter when compared to all the
nuclear genes. Very short proteins have been reported as
proproteins, precursors of regulatory peptides [86].
Despite the fact that the function of 80% of AtU{1:0}E
genes and 95% of OsU{1:0}E genes remains unknown,
the analysis of the 105 AtU{1:0}E with annotated function seems to reinforce this hypothesis as we have found
that many AtU{1:0}E code for known precursors of short
peptide phytohormones with signalling roles [61].
From a phylogenetic point of view, product length conservation and similar relative transcription level of the 937
pan-orthologous genes in A. thaliana and O. sativa
(U{1:1}) are clear evidence of a common origin. However, intron insertion site conservation is the best proof
that couples of U{1.1} have evolved from a common
ancestor and are not the consequence of convergence.
This intron conservation is also evident for the 192
U{1:1:1:1} genes where dN/dS analysis shows that those
genes conserved as unique in very distant photosynthetic

species are pan-orthologs under negative selection pressure to keep them in a low divergence rate and unique.
This situation reinforces the idea of a probable important
conserved function.
It could be suggested that the characterization of panorthologs (conserved single copy genes in two or more
species) could be noised by the presence of paralogs in the
situation where opposite members of a pair of duplicated
genes are lost in two daughter species. Nevertheless, our
results about conservation of protein sizes, transcription
levels and sequence conservation (dN/dS) argue that, if it
is the case, the gene loss occurred before both duplicates
diverged enough to allow us to recognized them as paralogs rather than as orthologs.
The phylogenetic profiles of conserved single copy genes
and the predicted subcellular location of the corresponding proteins, provides additional information on the origin and the function of these particular genes. An A.
thaliana subset of unique genes with homologs in plants
and bacteria contains 49.1% of genes encoding proteins
with targeting peptides specific to the chloroplast. This
observation suggests that the origin of this subset of
unique genes could be a DNA transfer from chloroplast or
bacteria genome posterior to the eukaryote radiation.
Our analysis of the conserved single copy genes, coming
in addition to many duplicated gene studies, provides
new information on plant gene evolution. Thus, an
important part of the genes in only one copy in present
plant genomes have an ancient origin and a low divergence rate controlled by a strong selection pressure. The
species-specific unique genes that have some structural
features in common with the conserved single copy genes
are probably recruited from some conserved single copy
genes experiencing a rapid divergence linked to a speciation event. However, functions of many of these conserved single copy genes remain unknown. Deeper
annotation of small coding sequences that may not be
identified by gene finders because of the conservative
nature of the prediction algorithms, as well as more experimental data could help to decipher the biological functions of this particular gene population.

Methods
Data sources
The complete proteomes were obtained from TAIR [87]
for A. thaliana (R6), TIGR [88] for O. sativa (R3), and JGI
[89] for P. patens and O. lucimarinus. For A. thaliana and
O. sativa, we retrieved data concerning the number of transcripts, the PFAM motifs and the promoter sequences
from FLAGdb++ [90]. Expression data were obtained from
CATdb [37] and Genevestigator [39].

Unique gene characterization
All the proteins encoded by the nuclear genes of each species were retrieved and those from pseudogenes were
removed. To identify genes coding for proteins unique in
a genome, three different filters were successively applied
to the genes (Figure 1). The first filter used the PFAM
resource [31] and was selected based on the fact that proteins with common protein motifs are most often
homologs. The detection of PFAM motifs is based on
HMM profiles (through the HMMER tool) which are
more adapted than simple sequence comparisons for the
definition of conserved regions, allowing us to eliminate
paralogs. All the proteins without PFAM motifs were
saved in a list of candidate unique proteins and those with
PFAM motifs were re-filtered to select as candidates only
the proteins for which the PFAM is unique in the analysed
proteome. Second, the proteins encoded by candidate
unique genes were compared against the whole proteome
through BLASTp. Indeed, the fact that the PFAM resource
does not tag around 30% of A. thaliana and O. sativa proteins and the risk that the PFAM filter introduces bias in
tagging preferentially large proteins is corrected by additional BLAST analyses. Furthermore, we have taken care
that our BLASTp parameters allow the detection of similarities between very small proteins: Proteins giving an evalue lower than e-10 with another protein in the same
genome were discarded from the unique gene list. Third,
the genes giving an e-value between e-5 and e-10 with
another sequence were considered as unique genes only if
they showed a partial match not larger than 30% of their
sequence length (size ratio filter). This cut-off (size ratio
filter), based on manual expertise of numerous blast
results, permitted us to keep genes with hits too small to
be considered as probably good despite the e-value
obtained.
Conserved single copy genes
A BLASTp of the unique proteins of each species was
launched against a database containing the unique protein sequences from every other species. Pairs of proteins
showing an e-value lower than e-10, or up to e-5 but satisfying the condition imposed by to the size ratio filter
described above, were classified as conserved between the
two species. Conserved proteins were then separated into
two groups, the U{1:1} proteins if there was only one
positive hit or the U{1:m} proteins if there were more
than one hit. U{1:1} genes characterized in each species
were compared to select only reciprocal best hits (RBH)
and allowed us to remove some U{1:1} in one species
qualified as U{1:m} in other species due to a splitting/
fusion process. A second BLASTp was launched with those
proteins without any hit against a database containing all
the proteins from every other species. Applying again the
same e-value and size ratio filter as described above, we
clustered them as U{1:m} proteins if they had more than

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:280

one hit, and as U{1:0} if they had no hit on the other species, i.e. the species specific unique proteins.
Genomic organization of unique genes
The limits defining the boundaries of duplicated regions
in A. thaliana and O. sativa genomes were retrieved from
TIGR database [88]. The even distribution of each group
of unique gene pairs between the chromosomes was
tested using a chi-square (χ2) test with a confidence level
of 99.5% (expected value of 14.86 and 26.76 for 4 and 11
degrees of freedom, respectively).
Unique gene and protein features
All the different information about genes and proteins
was retrieved from the FLAGdb++ database [90]. Information includes protein lengths, number of exons, intron
positions and promoter sequences (see Additional file 1).
Only the genes with CDS fully covered by experimental
transcript data were used (17,108 and 15,814 nuclear
genes in A. thaliana and O. sativa respectively). For the
analysis of promoter sequences, only genes with at least
one cognate transcript covering the regions were studied
(14,689 and 17,720 for A. thaliana and O. sativa respectively). Intron positions were compared after aligning protein sequences with ClustalW [91]. Intronic conserved
positions included those that diverged by not more than
5 amino acids to take into account minor variability in
intron position found in different organisms [92]. For
promoter analyses, the TSS (Transcription Start Site) was
defined as the point where the 5' UTR (minimum size of
50 bp) started and promoter sequences comprised the
1,000 nucleotides upstream from it. Positions of such
well-known promoters as the TATA (TATAWA consensus
[93]), TELO (AAACCCTAA consensus [47], SORLIP2 (also
called motif II: GGCCA consensus [47,48]) and CAAT
(CCAAT consensus [49]) boxes in each species were set
with a program developed by Bernard et al [94] capable of
defining significant TFBS preferential positions in promoter regions avoiding false positives [95]. If the TSS
defines position 1, in A. thaliana preferential positions
were set at: -40 to -21 for TATA-box; -60 to 140 for TELObox; -240 to -21 for SORLIP2-box and -160 to -41 for
CAAT-box. Similarly, in O. sativa TFBS were searched for
in the following regions: -40 to -21 for TATA-box; -80 to
180 for TELO-box; -280 to -1 for SORLIP2-box and -200
to -1 for CAAT-box.
At and Os U{1:1} gene expression
We based our estimation of the correlation between
U{1:1}gene expression in A. thaliana and O. sativa on
EST/cDNA resources. The numbers of associated transcripts of each gene were normalized and logarithmically
transformed for comparisons purposes. Normalization
avoided biases caused by both the number of transcripts
available and the different number of genes for each spe-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/280

cies. The normalization established an equivalence of
1.56 transcripts in O. sativa for one transcript in A. thaliana. Comparisons of observed values were made against
values from 100 random samples of 937 nuclear gene
pairs. To avoid sampling biases due to genes with none or
very few transcripts, we only considered the gene pairs
with at least 30 cognate transcripts for each member. Furthermore, the random samples only contained protein
pairs with a maximum size difference of 20 amino acids
between the two members.
Phylogenetic and functional analyses
The phylogenetic evolution of unique genes was analysed
from Ostreococcus lucimarinus (Prasinophyceae) to Arabidopsis thaliana including Physcomitrella patens (Funariaceae) and Oryza sativa. With the unique gene
characterization method (described above), we systematically searched for unique proteins in the available proteomes of the four species studied. Once obtained, we
used them in a BLASTp search to look for O. lucimarinus
unique proteins with a pan-ortholog on each branch of
evolution (Figure 6). By this way, we first constructed
U{1:1} protein pairs between O. lucimarinus and P. patens.
After, O. lucimarinus U{1:1} proteins were used in a new
BLASTp comparison against O. sativa unique proteins to
found U{1:1:1} proteins, and so on until the characterization of the U{1:1:1:1} proteins. Similar protocol was
performed starting from A. thaliana unique proteins and
looking for their conservation on each node of the tree.
Both lists of U{1:1:1:1} genes, one per sense, were crossed
to eliminate inconsistencies and obtain a final list of 192
U{1:1:1:1} proteins. We calculated the expected conserved number of U{1:1:1:1} genes from O. lucimarinus to
A. thaliana under the no selection pressure hypothesis.
The expected number of U{1:1:1:1}genes assuming random conservation was calculated as the number of O. lucimarinus genes (7,618) multiplied by the combined
probability of a gene being conserved as unique in O. lucimarinus (35.32%), P. patens (23.22%), O. sativa (13.88%)
and A. thaliana (9.58%). The expected number of
U{1:1:1:1} genes by random conservation would be 8.38
genes. For each species pair permutation, unique genes
were aligned with their corresponding ortholog using
ClustalW, and the synonymous and non-synonymous
substitution rates (dN and dS) were calculated using the
Codeml program of the PAML package [81]. The protein
pairs considered as too divergent by Codeml were nevertheless taken into account in the median dN/dS calculation. For comparison, dN and dS values were also
calculated with the same method from a set of 7,551
orthologous proteins predicted by the RBH method using
the 3 proteomes of A. thaliana, O. sativa and V. vinifera.
Conservation of U{1:1:1:1} genes in other species and
functional information were retrieved from the results of
BLASTp against the Uniprot database, with a limit e-value

of e-10. Comparisons were done against the results of 100
random samples of 200 nuclear genes. The subcellular
localization of A. thaliana proteins deduced from predictions of signal sequences (based on PSORT, PREDOTAR
and CHLOROP software) were recovered from the
FLAGdb++ database [90]. The presence of cis-regulatory
motifs within promoters was searched with the protocol
previously described [94].
