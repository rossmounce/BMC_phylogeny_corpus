Abstract
Background: As a rule, about 1% of genes in a given genome encode glycoside hydrolases and
their homologues. On the basis of sequence similarity they have been grouped into more than
ninety GH families during the last 15 years. The GH97 family has been established very recently
and initially included only 18 bacterial proteins. However, the evolutionary relationship of the genes
encoding proteins of this family remains unclear, as well as their distribution among main groups of
the living organisms.
Results: The extensive search of the current databases allowed us to double the number of GH97
family proteins. Five subfamilies were distinguished on the basis of pairwise sequence comparison
and phylogenetic analysis. Iterative sequence analysis revealed the relationship of the GH97 family
with the GH27, GH31, and GH36 families of glycosidases, which belong to the α-galactosidase
superfamily, as well as a more distant relationship with some other glycosidase families (GH13 and
GH20).
Conclusion: The results of this study show an unexpected sequence similarity of GH97 family
proteins with glycoside hydrolases from several other families, that have (β/α)8-barrel fold of the
catalytic domain and a retaining mechanism of the glycoside bond hydrolysis. These data suggest a
common evolutionary origin of glycosidases representing different families and clans.

Background
On the basis of sequence similarity, glycoside hydrolases
(or glycosidases, EC3.2.1.-) have been grouped into 96
families (GH1-GH100, except GH21, GH40, GH41, and
GH60) by the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) classification [1,2]. In the case of poly-domain proteins each
catalytic domain is considered separately. A family was
initially defined as a group of at least two sequences displaying significant amino acid similarity and with no significant similarity with other families [1]. Later, some
related families of glycosidases have been combined into
clans [3,4]. According to its definition, a clan is a group of

families that are thought to have a common ancestry and
are recognized by significant similarities in tertiary structure together with conservation of the catalytic residues
and a catalytic mechanism [3]. Glycosidases catalyze
hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond of their substrates via
two general mechanisms, leading to either inversion or
overall retention of the anomeric configuration at the
cleavage point [4-6]. Currently, 14 clans (GH-A-GH-N)
are described, and in total they contain 46 families [2].
Families of four clans (GH-A, GH-D, GH-H, and GH-K),
as well as several other families, that have not been
assigned to any clan, contain proteins with a similar (β/

α)8-barrel fold of the catalytic domain [2]. Several glycosidases, that do not have any homologues, are included into
a group of non-classified glycoside hydrolases [1,2]. In
several instances, proteins from this group have been
reclassified into new families when their homologues
were found [7].
Two different clans have never been merged in the CAZy
classification [2], even after their significant similarity has
been established. Instead, related clans (and families)
having statistically significant sequence similarity of the
corresponding proteins were proposed to be grouped into
superfamilies at a higher hierarchical level. For example,
we have described the furanosidase (β-fructosidase)
superfamily, that includes clans GH-F (inverting glycosidases) and GH-J (retaining glycosidases), as well as the
GHLP (COG2152) family of enzymatically-uncharacterized proteins [8-11].
Nowadays, some families are very large. For example,
GH13 family (clan GH-H) includes more than 2,000 representatives [2]. This large and poly-specific group of
enzymes has been studied by many authors [12-19]. In
particular, it was shown that splitting of this family into
smaller subfamilies allowed to clarify the relationship of
its members [12,13].
The majority of known glycosidases with the α-galactosidase activity [EC3.2.1.22] belong to families GH27 and
GH36, that form clan GH-D [2,20]. This clan and family
GH31 compose the α-galactosidase superfamily [21-24].
This superfamily has a distant relationship with clan GHH [25,26], which we have proposed to name the α-glucosidase superfamily [24]. Both superfamilies contain
proteins sharing the same enzymatic mechanism (retention), a similar (β/α)8-barrel fold of the catalytic domain
[2], and use substrates only with the axial orientation of
the glycosidic bond [4].
Gram-negative obligate anaerobe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron ATCC29148 is a commensal bacterium found in the
human colon where it ferments a wide variety of polysaccharides [27,28]. Its starch utilization system (sus) has
been studied in detail [29-35]. One of the corresponding
loci (Figure 1) includes divergently oriented regulatory
gene susR and seven structural genes susA-susG [30-34].
Genes susC-susF encode outer membrane proteins are
involved in starch binding. Glycosidases SusA (a neopullulanase, EC 3.2.1.135) and SusG (an α-amylase, EC
3.2.1.1) are members of family GH13 [29-32]. SusB is an
unusual α-glucosidase [EC 3.2.1.20] that for a long time
was considered a unique glycosidase with no homologues
[29,30]. Therefore it was included in the group of nonclassified glycoside hydrolases [2]. We have found a group
of its homologues among hypothetical proteins encoded

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/112

by open reading frames (ORFs), that recently were
sequenced in the frame of several prokaryotic genome
projects. We referred to this group of proteins as the GHX
family [23,24]. In June 2004, 18 members of this family
were recognized in the CAZy classification as the GH97
family of glycoside hydrolases. Currently (June 2005),
family GH97 includes two α-glucosidases SusB from
closely related bacteria B. thetaiotaomicron ATCC29148
and Tannerella forsythensis (Bacteroides forsythus)
ATCC43037, as well as 22 hypothetical proteins encoded
by ORFs [2].
In this work we updated the GH97 family of glycosidases,
performed its phylogenetic analysis, and established its
evolutionary relationship with several other glycosidase
families.

Results and discussion
Collecting sequences of family GH97
PSI-BLAST search of the non-redundant database with the
Bacteroides
thetaiotaomicron
α-glucosidase
SusB
(97A1_BACTH, see Table I) as a query sequence yielded
32 protein sequences with the worst (the largest) E-value
of 2 × 10-20 during the first round. Among them we found
10 paralogous proteins from B. thetaiotaomicron
ATCC29148 and their 22 homologues from other species.
Among 32 obtained proteins were found all 24 members
of the GH97 family listed at the CAZy server [2]. Genomic
BLAST revealed 13 additional homologous sequences.
Based on the sequence similarity, we propose to enlarge
the GH97 family by including all known homologues of
SusB. As a result, currently this family includes 45 proteins. The majority of them represent Eubacteria (16 different species). Three other sequences correspond to
Archaea (Haloarcula marismortui) and two uncultured bacteria. Four sequences are annotated in the NCBI database
as eukaryotic (Anopheles gambiae) genome fragments.
Only five out of 45 protein sequences (from Anopheles and
an uncultured bacterium) are short fragments (Table I).

PSI-BLAST searches with a few randomly selected divergent representatives of the GH97 family used as a query
sequence during the first round always yielded the same
32 protein sequences as with 97A1_BACTH. An analysis
of the order of the sequence appearance during the first
round of searches by PSI-BLAST, depending on the query,
allows us to distinguish five subfamilies (97a–97e) in the
GH97 family with at least two known members in each of
them (Table I). The obtained pairwise alignments were
used for generating the protein multiple sequence alignment of family GH97. The most conserved parts of the
alignment are shown on Figure 2.

codons in the region homologous to genes of GH97 family proteins. An analysis of the nucleic acid sequence
allowed us to detect a frame shift (data not shown). The
improved ORF encodes protein sequence (97C1_LEIXY),
showing a significant sequence similarity with the other
members of family GH97 along its whole length (Figure
2). However, it was impossible to determine the very
beginning of the protein sequence including the start
codon. This protein is a divergent representative of the
GH97 family and it could not be classified into any subfamily on the basis of pairwise sequence comparison.
97C1_LEIXY and its closest homologue 97D1_CAUCR (Evalue = 2 × 10-54) have only 30% of sequence identity.

A short gene fragment [GenBank: AY350337] from an
uncultured bacterium was revealed by Genomic BLAST. It
had been obtained and sequenced during PCR screening
of human gut microflora [36]. The deduced protein
sequence (97A2_UNBAC) corresponds to the C-terminal
part of the others GH97 family proteins and has the highest similarity level with 97A1_BACTH (63% of sequence
identity) and 97A1_TANFO (60%). It allows us to include
this protein fragment into subfamily 97a (Table I).
PSI-BLAST search of the non-redundant protein database
yielded a unique eukaryotic protein fragment [GenPept:
EAL42226] homologous to GH97 family proteins. Screen-

numbers of protein sequences are given according to the NCBI database [72]. Numbers of nucleic sequences are given (in parentheses) if the
corresponding protein sequences have not been deposited. In some cases (asterisked), protein sequences were edited by changing the start codon.
length was established as the number of amino acids in the corresponding precursor. Incomplete sequences (protein fragments) are asterisked.

ing of the database of eukaryotic nucleic acid sequences
uncovered the corresponding DNA sequence [GenBank:
AAAB01006165], as well as three other short sequences
[GenBank: AAAB01064948, AAAB01020110, and
AAAB01068263]. All of them had been sequenced during
the mosquito Anopheles gambiae genome project [37].
These 4 sequences were aligned for the identification of
overlapping regions. AAAB01064948 sequence is homologous to the central part of AAAB01006165 sequence having 54% of identity at the protein level. The ends of
AAAB01020110 sequence are respectively homologous to
one end of AAAB01006165 and AAAB01068263
sequences: 65% and 69% sequence identity at the protein
level. Thus, these 4 sequences correspond to at least two
different genes. In total, they cover a complete bacterial
gene encoding of a protein of family GH97. Taking into
account i) a high similarity level of the 4 deduced protein
sequences with bacterial proteins (50–71% identity with
97A1_BACFR, 97A2_BACTH, 97A1_TANFO, and
97A1_BACTH), ii) the intron-free gene structure, iii) an
inability to map the genes on the mosquito chromosomes, and iv) absence of GH97 family proteins in any
other eukaryotic organism, we suggest the bacterial origin
of these four gene fragments. The bacterial origin could
have resulted from a contamination of Anopheles gambiae
tissue used for preparing of genome library by mosquito
Bacteroides-like gut microflora. The evidence for such kind
of contamination was obtained when testing the 35,575
clones from A. gambiae cDNA library [38]. It was found
that at least 808 sequences appeared to be bacterial contaminants.
In order to enlarge database of family GH97 we performed screening of the so-called "Environmental Sam-

ples data" [39]. It revealed 60 nucleic acid sequences from
the Sargasso Sea that are homologous to genes of GH97
family proteins. However, the majority of them encode
only short protein fragments and many of them have a
very high level of sequence similarity. Among them we
found only 5 full-size or almost complete genes (each
encodes a protein consisting of more than 650 amino acid
residues). Three additional "gene" sequences were
obtained by combining overlapping gene fragments with
almost identical sequences (at least 95% of sequence
identity at the protein level). Hypothetical proteins
(97A1_ENSEQ-97A8_ENSEQ) encoded by these 8 genes
should be placed in the 97a subfamily, on the basis of
sequence similarity (Table I). Moreover, the majority of
the incomplete genes encode protein fragments belonging
to the same subfamily. Only four [GenPept: EAE76000,
EAE67019, EAH16525, and EAH96685] and two [GenPept: EAE21375 and EAG68085] protein fragments correspond to subfamilies 97b and 97c, respectively. One short
fragment (137 amino acids; [GenPept: EAD85224]) cannot be unambiguously classified into any subfamily of the
GH97 family. An analysis of the nucleic acid sequence
encoding the latter protein fragment [GenBank:
AACY01501371] allowed us to extend the protein fragment by using another start codon. The resulting protein
sequence (97C1_ENSEQ; 218 amino acids) shows similarity with the sequences of the other members of family
GH97 along its whole length. However, it was still impossible to include this protein fragment into any subfamily
on the basis of pairwise sequence comparison.
Phylogenetic analysis of family GH97
To check the actual relationships of proteins within the
GH97 family we performed a phylogenetic analysis using

Figure of
Portion 2 the multiple sequence alignment of the sequences analyzed
Portion of the multiple sequence alignment of the sequences analyzed. Ten-letter name for each sequence is indicated in the leftmost column (for origin of the sequences see Table I). The alignment continuously spans three panels. Distances to the N- and C-termini and length of omitted fragments are indicated. Highly conserved residues are highlighted in
sequences. Amino acid positions that are highly conserved within several subfamilies but varied in amino acid residues in different subfamilies are coloured. Subfamily belonging of sequences (for family GH97) are indicated in the most right. Amino acid
residues, interacting with the substrate in the active center of GH27 and GH31 family glycosidases, are indicated by arrows at
the bottom [50-54]. The arrow on the gray background corresponds to the Asp residue, playing the role of the nucleophile in
glycosidases of families GH27 and GH31. Red asterisks over and under the alignment indicate three conserved positions (in
red) probably corresponding to the nucleophile and proton donor in the glycosidases of family GH97 (see text). Alignment of
GH27_ORYSA and GH31_ECOLI is structure-based. At the bottom of the figure, β-strands and α-helixes of the (β/α)8-barrel
are indicated. The first part of the barrel (β1–β4) is shown according to the known structures of GH27 and GH31 family members [51, 54]. The second part of the barrel (α4–α8) is based on generalization of predictions for several GH97 family proteins
by 3D-PSSM, GOR IV, and nnpredict programs.

known that phylogeny is the best basis for verification of
subfamily structure of a protein family. In many works,
where composition of a glycosidase family has been analyzed, the monophyletic status was used as the main argument for a subfamily description. Among others [40-44],
this method has been applied to GH13 [12,13], GH27
[23,24], and GH36 [24] families of glycoside hydrolases.
In order to verify our subdivision of the GH97 family into
subfamilies we checked the clustering of the family members in the phylogenetic tree. The maximum parsimony
(MP; Figure 3A) and the neighbor-joining (NJ; Figure 3B)
trees have very similar topology, suggesting the correct
interpretation of the evolutionary events. When any subfamily of the GH97 family was considered as an outgroup,
both MP and NJ trees showed that all other subfamilies
appear to form monophyletic groups with a high bootstrap value (at least 95.4% of support at both trees). It
should be noted that there is no pair of subfamilies that
compose neighbor clusters on both trees with significant
bootstrap support. This suggests approximately the same
evolutionary distance between each pair of the subfamilies.
The archaeal protein 97A1_HALMA is a clear outlayer in
the cluster of subfamily 97a at MP and NJ trees (Figure 3).
The other members of this subfamily compose several
subclusters, that include representatives either from
Bacteroidetes or Proteobacteria phyla.
Unclassified protein 97C1_LEIXY is the closest neighbor
of subfamily 97c cluster at MP and NJ trees (Figure 3) and
therefore it can be considered as a divergent representative
of this subfamily (Table I). Phylogenetic analysis of
97C1_ENSEQ protein fragment (data not shown) allowed
us to place it into the same subfamily 97c.
An analysis of the GH97 family multiple sequence alignment revealed a number of amino acid positions that are
highly conserved within several subfamilies but varied in
amino acid residues in different subfamilies (Figure 2).
Taken together, these signature sequence positions allow
to predict the subfamily belonging of a protein sequence.
Relationship of family GH97 with some other glycosidase
families
Depending on the GH97 query and the statistical significance threshold of E-value, during the second or third PSIBLAST iterations, as a rule, we detected statistically significant similarities with α-galactosidases. They represent
families GH27 and GH36 of clan GH-D (the α-galactosidase superfamily). More distant similarities were found
with glycosidases of family GH31 (the α-galactosidase
superfamily) and in some cases with enzymaticallyuncharacterized proteins from COG0535. COG0535 has

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/112

been annotated as a family of predicted Fe-S oxidoreductases, like the closest COG0641 [45]. Our BLAST searches
show, that both COG families are related to the radical
SAM superfamily of Fe-S enzymes [46], having (β/α)8-barrel fold [PDB: 1R30].
When we used some representatives of subfamily 97a (for
example, 97A1_BACTH) as a query and an E-value cut-off
of 0.01, it was possible to reveal statistically significant
similarity with glycosidases of family GH20 (clan GH-K).
A similarity with proteins of this family was detected after
the second PSI-BLAST iteration, while the next one or two
iterations revealed a distant relationship with members of
COG0296 (family GH13 of clan GH-H). It should be
noted that glycosidases from the clans GH-D, GH-H, and
GH-K have a similar (β/α)8-barrel fold of their catalytic
domain and the same molecular mechanism of the hydrolyzing reaction [2]. Thus, our results agree with the data of
several authors [20,25,47-49] showing the relationship of
glycosidases from GH13, GH27, GH31, and GH36 families. More detail analysis of these families and their relationship was done by Rigden [26].
Using the α-galactosidases from rice (GH27_ORYSA, family GH27) and Lactobacillus plantarum (GH36_LACPL,
family GH36) as a query sequence for PSI-BLAST searches
we found their homology with some representatives of
the GH97 family (for example, 97B1_BACFR and
97B2_BACTH) after two or three iterations. However, a
statistically significant sequence similarity of GH97 family proteins with α-galactosidases is restricted to a fragment of about 100–150 amino acid residues (Figure 2).
This fragment corresponds to the N-terminal half of the
catalytic (β/α)8-barrel domain of glycosidases from the αgalactosidase superfamily [50-54]. This half of the
domain is known to be more conserved than the C-terminal half [26]. Therefore, we can assume that the catalytic
domain of the GH97 family proteins also has a similar (β/
α)8-barrel fold.
In order to check whether the whole (β/α)8-barrel domain
is present in GH97 family proteins, we tried to reconstruct
their secondary and tertiary structure. The SWISS-MODEL
program failed to unambiguously predict the type of the
tertiary structure. The 3D-PSSM, GOR IV, and nnpredict
programs were used for prediction of the protein secondary structure. The results obtained suggest that the central
part of the GH97 family protein sequences represents a
typical and complete (β/α)8-barrel domain (Figure 2).
The N- and C-terminal parts of the sequences, mainly consisting of β-strands, most probably form two additional
non-catalytic domains with an unknown function. However, different programs produce contradictory results
regarding the number and exact location of the β-strands
(data not shown). The non-catalytic domains of glycosi-

Page 8 of 12
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:112

dases from the α-galactosidase and α-glucosidase superfamilies are also predominantly composed of β-strands.
At least some of these domains are involved in oligomerization and carbohydrate binding [2,54].
3D-PSSM searches of the PDB database with several GH97
family proteins used as a query sequence yielded the highest level of similarity with the GH27 family glycosidases
[PDB: 1KTB, 1BFM, 1R46, and 1UAS]. Among other best
hits we have found representatives of several other (β/α)8barrel fold glycoside hydrolase families: GH2 (clan GHA), GH5 (GH-A), GH13 (GH-H), GH17 (GH-A), GH18
(GH-K), and GH20 (GH-K), as well as some other
enzymes with (β/α)8-barrel fold, for example Bacillus subtilis inositol utilization protein IolI [PDB: 1I6N]. These
results are in agreement with the hypothesis about common origin of all (β/α)8-barrel protein domains, that
evolved from an ancestral (β/α)4 half-barrel by a tandem
gene duplication followed by a fusion [55-60].
In all known glycosidases with the (β/α)8-barrel fold, the
amino acid residues involved in the active center are
located on the C-termini of the β-strands [61], a similar
location of the active site was found in many other (β/α)8barrel fold enzymes [60]. It is well known that two acidic
groups (Asp and/or Glu) are almost always involved in
the glycosidase active center, playing the roles of nucleophile and proton donor [4-6]. Their sequence location
has been determined for several representatives of the
GH27 and GH31 families [54,62-69].
The Asp residue, playing the role of nucleophile, is located
on the C-terminus of the fourth β-strand of the barrel.
This residue is highly conserved among proteins of the αgalactosidase superfamily [23,26]. The homologous residue in the GH97 family proteins is more variable, being
Asp in all members of three subfamilies (97b, 97c, and
97d) and Gly in the other proteins (subfamilies 97a and
97e), including 97A1_BACTH and 97A1_TANFO (Figure
2). Since these two proteins display the α-glucosidase
activity [29,30,70] we can conclude that a residue, set in
another site, plays the role of nucleophile at least in some
proteins of the GH97 family. It should be noted that we
have found a residue on the C-terminus of the fifth βstrand in GH97 family sequences that is Gly in 97b, 97c,
and 97d subfamilies, but Glu and Asp in subfamilies 97a
and 97e respectively (Figure 2). Therefore, this residue can
be suggested as a possible nucleophile in glycosidases of
97a and 97e subfamilies. As a rule, the catalytically essential residues are highly conserved among enzymatically
active members of a glycoside hydrolase family, being
either Asp, or Glu. The distance between the carboxylic
groups of the nucleophile and the proton donor should
be similar in order to keep the catalytic machinery. Thus,
the difference in the predicted nucleophile residue

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/112

between 97a and 97e subfamilies is unexpected. However,
this does not exclude the existence of a glycosidase activity
in proteins with Asp residue at the fifth β-strand (subfamily 97e). To illustrate, in the GH32 family the Asp residue was experimentally shown to be the nucleophile,
while several proteins of this family have Glu residue at
the homologous position and at least some of them are
catalytically active [10,11].
The proton donor of families GH27 and GH31 is located
on the C-terminus of the sixth β-strand of the (β/α)8-barrel domain. It is outside of the N-terminal half of barrel,
which can be unambiguously aligned with proteins of the
GH97 family. However, on the C-terminus of the sixth βstrand of the predicted (β/α)8-barrel of the GH97 family
there is an Asp residue, which is highly conserved in all
subfamilies of the family (Figure 2). We suggest this residue as a possible proton donor. Taking into account
another structure of the active center and significant
sequence similarity of only a half of the catalytic domain,
the current data do not support an inclusion of the GH97
family into the α-galactosidase superfamily.
As far as we know, 97A1_BACTH and 97A1_TANFO are
the only enzymatically-characterized proteins in the
GH97 family [2]. All other members of this family have
been found recently during genome projects and are
encoded by ORFs. Genes of this family are represented
only in a limited number of Eubacteria from phyla Actinobacteria (1 genus), Bacteroidetes (4 genera), Planctomycetes (1 genus), and Proteobacteria (3 and 4 genera
from α- and γ-classes, respectively), as well as in a unique
Archaea (Haloarcula marismortui). However, many of these
bacteria have several paralogous genes. The most interesting case is that of B. thetaiotaomicron ATCC29148, which
has α-glucosidase SusB (97A1_BACTH) and 9 putative
paralogues representing four GH97 subfamilies (Table I),
at least two of the paralogues (97C1_BACTH and
97C2_BACTH) are also expressed in vivo [28]. This human
commensal microorganism is known as a bacterium with
the highest number of glycosidase and glycosyltransferase
genes [27,71]. Taken together, these facts we can suggest
that evolution of GH97 family proteins has been associated with multiple duplications, gene elimination, and
horizontal transfer.

Conclusion
The results of the sequence analysis allow us to distinguish five subfamilies in the GH97 family of glycoside
hydrolases. The experimental data on the enzymatic activity are available only for two representatives of the GH97
family: α-glucosidases 97A1_BACTH and 97A1_TANFO
[29,30,70]. However, we suppose that the other members
of this family may also possess some glycosidase activities.
Our data suggest that proteins of this family have a com-

mon evolutionary origin with glycosidases of the α-galactosidase superfamily. Many genes, encoding proteins of
the GH97 family, are located in clusters with genes of glycoside hydrolases and other carbohydrate-active enzymes.
For example, 97C1_BACTH and 97C2_BACTH (subfamily 97c) are encoded by genes of B. thetaiotaomicron
located at a hemicellulose utilization locus together with
eight other glycosidase genes (Figure 1). Taken together,
these data support a recent suggestion to consider family
GH97 (or GHX) as a new family of glycoside hydrolases
[2,24]. The evolutionary relationship of GH97 proteins
with glycosidases of the GH-D, GH-H, and GH-K (and
probably GH-A) clans allows to extrapolate their common
most important characteristics to glycoside hydrolases of
the GH97 family. We can predict a similar (β/α)8-barrel
fold of the catalytic domain and retaining mechanism of
the glycoside bond hydrolysis for glycosidases of the
GH97 family.

Methods
Protein and nucleic sequences were retrieved from the
NCBI database [72]. All proteins analyzed in this work
were designated by a ten-letter name (see Table I). The
search for homologous proteins was done using the PSIBLAST [73] and Genomic BLAST at the NCBI server. The
statistical significance threshold for including a sequence
in the model (E-value) used by PSI-BLAST in the next iteration was either 10-2 or 10-3, BLOSUM45 was used as a
substitution matrix. Multiple sequence alignment was
prepared manually using the program BioEdit [74] on the
basis of BLAST pairwise alignments.
The multiple sequence alignment was used to implement
classical phylogenetic inference programs, using either
maximum parsimony or distance methods. Programs
PROTPARS and NEIGHBOR from the PHYLIP package
(version 3.6; [75]) were used. Moreover, programs SEQBOOT, PROTPARS, and CONSENSE and programs SEQBOOT, PROTDIST, NEIGHBOR, and CONSENSE were
successively used to derive confidence limits, estimated by
1000 bootstrap replicates, for each node in the maximum
parsimony and distance tree, respectively. The program
TreeView Win32 (version 1.6.6; [76]) was used for drawing the trees.
An analysis of the order of the display sequence during
searches by PSI-BLAST [73] was used for a preliminary
division of a family into subfamilies. The latter was
defined as a group of proteins that are displayed at the top
of the list in a PSI-BLAST query results. Depending on particular criteria of the protein similarity used, the algorithm
can split a family into a larger or smaller number of
groups of proteins. Like in some of our previous works
[10,23,24,77], in this study we define a subfamily as a
group of proteins that have at least 30% sequence identity.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/112

Phylogenetic analysis was used in order to verify the
obtained subfamilies and to clarify their boundaries. The
monophyletic status was used as a criterion for the final
definition of a subfamily.
The SWISS-MODEL modeling server [78] was used to predict the tertiary structure of proteins based on their amino
acid sequences. The 3D-PSSM [79], GOR IV [80] and
nnpredict [81] programs were used for prediction of the
protein secondary structure. The 3D-PSSM program also
was used to search the PDB database.

Added in proof
After submission of the manuscript, six new sequences of
GH97 family proteins have been deposited at the NCBI
database. Five of them (97A1_SHEBA, 97A1_SHEFR,
97A1_SHEDE, 97A1_SHEAM, and 97A1_SPHAL) belong
to subfamily 97a (Table I). The sixth protein
97X1_SOLUS cannot be unambiguously classified into
any subfamily of the GH97 family on the basis of pairwise
sequence comparison, composition of the signature
sequence positions, and phylogenetic analysis. Most
probably it corresponds to a new subfamily.
