Abstract
Background: Most phylogenetic studies using current methods have focused on primary DNA sequence information.
However, RNA secondary structures are particularly useful in systematics because they include characteristics, not found
in the primary sequence, that give "morphological" information. Despite the number of recent molecular studies on
octocorals, there is no consensus opinion about a region that carries enough phylogenetic resolution to solve
intrageneric or close species relationships. Moreover, intrageneric morphological information by itself does not always
produce accurate phylogenies; intra-species comparisons can reveal greater differences than intra-generic ones. The
search for new phylogenetic approaches, such as by RNA secondary structure analysis, is therefore a priority in octocoral
research.
Results: Initially, twelve predicted RNA secondary structures were reconstructed to provide the basic information for
phylogenetic analyses; they accorded with the 6 helicoidal ring model, also present in other groups of corals and
eukaryotes. We obtained three similar topologies for nine species of the Caribbean gorgonian genus Eunicea
(candelabrum corals) with two sister taxa as outgroups (genera Plexaura and Pseudoplexaura) on the basis of molecular
morphometrics of ITS2 RNA secondary structures only, traditional primary sequence analyses and maximum likelihood,
and a Bayesian analysis of the combined data. The latter approach allowed us to include both primary sequence and RNA
molecular morphometrics; each data partition was allowed to have a different evolution rate. In addition, each helix was
partitioned as if it had evolved at a distinct rate. Plexaura flexuosa was found to group within Eunicea; this was best
supported by both the molecular morphometrics and combined analyses. We suggest Eunicea flexuosa (Lamouroux,
1821) comb. nov., and we present a new species description including Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of
morphological characteristics (sclerites). Eunicea flexuosa, E. pallida, E. laxispica and E. mammosa formed a separate clade
in the molecular phylogenies, and were reciprocally monophyletic with respect to other Eunicea (Euniceopsis subgenus,
e.g. E. tourneforti and E. laciniata) in the molecular morphometrics tree, with the exception of E. fusca. Moreover, we
suggest a new diagnostic character for Eunicea, also present in E. flexuosa: middle layer sclerites > 1 mm in length.
Conclusion: ITS2 was a reliable sequence for intrageneric studies in gorgonian octocorals because of the amount of
phylogenetic signal, and was corroborated against morphological characters separating Eunicea from Plexaura. The ITS2
RNA secondary structure approach to phylogeny presented here did not rely on alignment methods such as INDELS,
but provided clearly homologous characters for partition analysis and RNA molecular morphometrics. These approaches
support the divergence of Eunicea flexuosa comb. nov. from the outgroup Plexaura, although it has been considered part
of this outgroup for nearly two centuries because of morphological resemblance.

Background
Millions of RNA sequences (as DNA) have been deposited
in public databases such as Genbank (NCBI), and over
one hundred thousand of these correspond to genes such
as 18S that are widely used in phylogenetic studies.
Although functional RNA sequences fold themselves to
form secondary structures that depend sensitively on the
primary sequence, only a handful of phylogenetic studies
have taken advantage of this secondary information. Most
phylogenetic studies using current methods have focused
on primary sequence information, but RNA secondary
structures are particularly useful in systematics because
they include characteristics, not found in the primary
sequence, that give "morphological" information for
reconstructing the complete tree of life [1]. Ribosomal
gene secondary structures have conserved zones that make
it easier to reconstruct the structures of unknown homologous RNA sequences by direct comparison. Although
molecular phylogenetic inference relies heavily on singlecopy genes, ribosomal genes that show concerted evolution still offer one of the best alternatives in the genome.
The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the value of RNA
secondary structures in improving and enhancing phylogenetic inference for a group of marine invertebrates.
Despite progress towards the resolution of octocoral phylogeny using mitochondrial gene sequences [2], there is
no consensus about a sequence region that provides
enough resolution for closely-related species relationships. The most variable regions known so far in octocorals are the Internal Transcribed Spacers (ITSs), which have
provided good resolution among a few soft coral species
that would be very difficult to distinguish morphologically because their characters show excessive homoplasy
[3,4]. However, the ITS region shows saturation and in
some cases many INDELS (insertions-deletions) in an
alignment, which can produce misleading results for high
taxonomic ranks [5]. Opportunely, analyses of the predicted RNA secondary structures of some genes such as
16S [4] and ITS2 [6] have provided an alternative way of
increasing the phylogenetic signal of RNA sequences for
octocorals. Here, we studied the predicted RNA secondary
structures of ITS2 to resolve close-species relationships
within the gorgonian genus Eunicea (candelabrum corals).
ITS2 (Internal Transcribed Spacer 2) sequences, found in
the tandem arrays of the nuclear ribosomal RNA between
the 5.8S and 28S genes, have not been considered useful
for molecular systematics in certain invertebrate groups
mainly because of their excessive INDELS and/or intragenomic variation [7,8]. Nonetheless, they seem to afford a
promising nuclear region for lower eukaryotes, particularly at the intra-familial level and down to closely-related
species, where other known regions are nearly invariant

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/90

[9-12]. In scleractinian corals, except for the genus Acropora, ITS sequences give reliable phylogenetic information
especially if the predicted RNA secondary structures are
compared [6]. These sequences vary considerably within
octocoral genera, providing information for classifying a
recently-described species, Alaskagorgia aleutiana Sánchez
and Cairns, within the Plexauridae; this was uncertain on
the basis of morphological characters, but the results were
consistent with mitochondrial DNA analysis [13,5]. Variation was also found within the Gorgoniidae family; ITS2
secondary structures retained and classified different gorgonian genera [5]. Perhaps they are among the most variable genomic regions in these organisms, while
mitochondrial DNA and other nuclear sequences are
highly conserved [10,11,14]. Unfortunately, ITS alignment always produces multiple and variable INDELS
depending on the different gap opening and/or extension
penalties (e.g. ClustalW), which make phylogenetic
reconstruction somewhat unreliable.
The known predicted ITS2 RNA secondary structure is a
model with a common core in most eukaryotes [15]. It is
a large-scale marker that is not limited to a specific taxonomic level and has even been used in mega-systematics
analysis [15]. Among other advantages, molecular morphometrics makes it possible to identify characters
informative about parsimony that are not found in the
primary sequence [16,17], and to correct primary alignments on the basis of secondary structure information [3].
Could the predicted ITS2 RNA secondary structures help
to overcome the great difficulties in the taxonomy of
lower invertebrates such as octocorals?
Caribbean octocorals are very abundant in coral reefs with
up to 60 species in a single location, and many species and
genera show few or no morphological differences [18].
Gorgonian octocorals from the genus Eunicea Lamouroux,
1816 (Cnidaria; Octocorallia; Alcyonacea [=Gorgonacea];
Plexauridae), known as "sea candelabrum", are endemic
to the Caribbean region (Tropical Western Atlantic Ocean
excluding the Brazilian region). There are 13 valid species,
although more than 30 species have been described in, or
assigned to, Eunicea [18,19]. No phylogeny for the Eunicea
genus has been constructed on the basis of morphological
or molecular characters, and this could be important for
testing the monophyly of the internal subgenera [19] and
other morphological characters that incur the risk of confusion with Plexaura octocorals [18]. In this study, in order
to differentiate between Eunicea and Plexaura gorgonian
corals using molecular and morphological data, we
present a phylogeny based on the predicted secondary
structures of the ITS2 sequences (molecular morphometrics) and contrast it with traditional molecular systematics
based on primary DNA alignment and Bayesian analysis.

Results
The ITS2 nuclear region ranged from 252 bp in Eunicea
laciniata to a minimum length of 185 bp in Plexaura kuna.
Twelve new predicted RNA secondary structures were constructed for this region, all following the 6 helicoidal ring
model except for E. pallida, which lacked the sixth helix
(Fig. 1I). Two major common features were present in
these structures: (1) 5' G-C, R-R, G-C, G-C, bulge on helix
IV and (2) 5' GUGC, bulge, CAAGG with its complementary pair base on helix V (Fig. 1).
Three different phylogenetic analyses were obtained from
the ITS2 sequence alignment. The molecular morphometrics analysis relied on 42 parsimony-informative characters and resulted in one most parsimonious tree using
ordered Wagner parsimony (Length = 270; Retention
index = 0.57). Both bootstrapping and decay indices
showed strong support for Plexaura and Eunicea as reciprocally monophyletic groups (95% and 9, respectively)
with the exception of E. flexuosa (new combination from
Plexaura flexuosa, see details below), which was clearly a
derived species of Eunicea (Fig. 2A). The topology based
only on the predicted RNA secondary structure of the ITS2
region resolved most relationships among the species
studied (Fig. 2A). Maximum likelihood analysis using traditional primary sequence alignment retained one tree
with the assumed model (TVMef+G) selected by AIC. The
tree searches had six substitution rates (A-C, 1.2431; A-G,
3.0064; A-T, 1.0809; C-G, 0.3376; C-T, 3.0064; and G-T,
1.0000), not assuming the proportion of invariant sites,
and a gamma-shape parameter (1.413); node support was
examined by 1000 bootstrap replicates (Fig. 2B). Bayesian
analysis of the same alignment retained the same topology and supported the same branches (data not shown).
This last topology differed in two main respects from the
molecular morphometrics tree: the placement of E. mammosa within the outgroup P. kuna Lasker, Cofforth and
Kim, with low bootstrap and Bayesian clade credibility
values (< 60%), and of E. fusca Duchassaing and Michelotti as a derived instead of a basal species (Fig. 2A–B).
The Bayesian inference in which helices were to evolve
independently at different rates in a mixed matrix secondary structure was similar to the molecular morphometrics
tree though less resolved within Eunicea (Fig. 2C). Eunicea
flexuosa (Lamouroux), E. pallida Garcia-Parrado and Alcolado, E. laxispica (Lamarck, 1815) and E. mammosa Lamouroux formed a separate clade in the molecular
phylogenies (except for E. mammosa in the maximum likelihood tree), most probably the Eunicea subgenus [19],
and were reciprocally monophyletic with respect to other
Eunicea (Euniceopsis subgenus : E. laciniata Duchassaing &
Michelotti, E. tourneforti Milne Edwards and Haime, and
Eunicea spp. 1–2), except for E. fusca in the molecular
morphometrics tree (Fig. 2). The predicted ITS2 RNA secondary structure models showed that E. mammosa, E. pal-

lida, E. laxispica and E. flexuosa exhibited a long helix IV
(Fig. 1A, E, H, I) that could be a sinapomorphic feature of
the Eunicea subgenus. Plexaura spp., in contrast, lacked
that helix [see Additional file 1].

Discussion
Traditionally, morphological identification of Eunicea
and Plexaura species has been based mostly on microscopic characteristics [19]. Morphological variation
within species can overlap with variation among species,
so molecular identification has become an important
alternative for octocorals in general. ITS2 has proven to be
a good molecular marker, resolving octocoral species at
different taxonomic levels [5]. In particular, the ITS2
sequences and predicted RNA secondary structures have
afforded a new view of the phylogeny of the Eunicea
genus. This approach supports the divergence of Eunicea
flexuosa comb. nov. from Plexaura, although it has been
considered part of this outgroup for nearly two centuries

because of morphological resemblance. Nonetheless, the
morphological observation of two subgenera in Eunicea
[19] seemed congruent with the molecular results.
The ITS2 RNA secondary structures yielded homologous
models that grouped conserved species features in the
Eunicea subgenus (e.g. long helix IV), though it is important to note that these molecular structures can also produce homoplasies because of selective pressures acting on
particular helix features such as the 6-helicoidal ring core,
conserved among most eukaryotes. ITS2 structures are
important for proper pre-rRNA maturation; any change in
their helix conformation can affect the process of 25S production [21]. Each helix was partitioned as if it had
evolved at a different rate and substitution bias, because
they do not all have the same role in this dynamic conformation [22]. This approach resulted in a supported Bayesian inference phylogram very similar to the molecular
morphometrics approach. The major difference between
the topologies obtained by the Bayesian (e.g. molecular
morphometrics using partitions) and primary sequence
(e.g maximum likelihood) methodologies, was the placement of E. mammosa in and out of Eunicea, which could be
due to the lack of phylogenetic signal and the likely saturation of ITS2 sequences after multiple alignment (e.g.
[5]).
The combined molecular-morphological Bayesian
approach data matrix has not been widely used, mainly
because until recently the methods for combining datasets
were only applied to parsimony-based analysis, which has
been shown to be insufficient when the combined data
imply different evolutionary scenarios [23]. This type of
analysis, combining molecular data with "typical" morphological characteristics, has sometimes failed to yield a
satisfactory model of character evolution [24]. Here, we
combined the corrected primary alignment (e.g. aligning
sequences from each helix only) with the molecular morphometrics data. Traditionally, some problems in
explaining changes in character state arise from assuming
that each character has exactly the same state at a particular time, in opposition to punctuated equilibria. In molecular morphometrics, the possibility of change is based in
the number of nucleotides present in a particular helix,
which can be readily identified. The other issue, corresponding to the comparison between character states, was
resolved using only the correction from the parsimonious-informative sites [24]. Nevertheless, because there
were inconsistencies in the placement of a few species (E.
mammosa and E. fusca), this study needs to be extended,
hopefully including all Eunicea representatives, in order to
gain a better understanding of the systematics of this
group as well as the evolution of their predicted ITS2 RNA
secondary structures.

Conclusion
The molecular study of this genus, which is the most species-rich among shallow-water Caribbean gorgonian corals, is just beginning. Consequently, ITS2 RNA secondary
structure analysis could be a valuable tool for distinguishing new species and completing Eunicea systematics: morphological phylogenetic reconstruction of octocorals is
very difficult (e.g. [13]), and ITS2 secondary structure contains more information than the usual primary sequence
alignment [5,26].

Methods
ITS2 sequences
Sequences were obtained using primers designed by [26],
which target the region between the 5' end of the 5.8S and
the 3' end of the 28S ribosomal genes, containing the
complete ITS2 (5.8S-436: 5'-AGCATGTCTGTCTGAGTGTTGG-3' and 28S-663: 5'-GGGTAATCTTGCCTGATCTGAG-3': numbers relate to the Alcyonium digitatum
sequence, Genbank Acc. No. AF262347: [2]). DNA was
extracted from material preserved in 95% ethanol using
the DNeasy kit (Qiagen). Template DNA for sequencing
was obtained from a combination of two PCR reactions
containing 1 μl DNA template (1:50 dilution of genomic
DNA extract), 2 units Taq polymerase (Promega), 3 μl 10X
Buffer (Promega), MgCl2, 0.15 μM dNTP mixture and
0.16 μM of each primer in 56 μl total volume (completed
with doubly-distilled water). PCR conditions were: one
initial period of 2.0 min at 94°C followed by 30 cycles of
30 s at 94°C, 45 s at 56°C, 1.0 45 s at 72°C, and a final
extension step for 5.0 min at 72°C. Genes were purified
using the Edge Biosystems kit and sequenced using
BigDye 3.1 (AB 3100, capillary electrophoresis automated
sequencer). Consensus sequences were obtained automatically by assembling the two complementary DNA
chromatograms (Sequencher software). Sequence information is available in Genbank (Accession numbers EF
490973-84).
Predicted ITS2 RNA secondary structures
Secondary structures for nine octocoral species were
reconstructed by aligning their sequences (using Bioedit)
[25] with homologous structures already published [26].
In addition, manual alignment was performed by visual
homology to construct a Dedicated Comparative
Sequence Editor (DCSE) format in order to perform different phylogenetic analyses. The DCSE format uses
square brackets ([, ]) to delimit each helix, braces ({, }) for
bulges and loops, and hyphens for gaps in the alignment;
terminal loops appear separated by inverse brackets (] and
[) (see Additional file 1). The acquired structures with
restrictions and constraints were submitted in MFOLD
[27]. RNA was folded at a fixed temperature of 37°C, and
the structure chosen from different output files was the
desired 6-helicoidal ring or the one with the highest neg-

ative free energy if various similar structures were
obtained.
Phylogenetic analyses
Sixteen sequences of the ITS2 region of nine Eunicea species (Eunicea sp. 1, E. fusca, E. mammosa, E. tourneforti, E.
laxispica, E. laciniata, E.pallida, Eunicea sp. 2 and E.flexuosa) and three corresponding to Pseudoplexaura crucis
Bayer, Plexaura homomalla (Esper) and Plexaura kuna were
analyzed. The manually-obtained alignment with secondary structure information was used to construct a matrix
for cladistic analysis based on molecular morphometrics
using geometrical features and base numbering [16].
Thus, secondary structure helices were numbered and
treated like characters that vary depending on their base
number. Bulges and internal loops were assigned the
number of the helix followed by a letter; ending helix
loops and separation segments were designated "i". Loop
complements, helix complements and separation segments were indicated with apostrophes (e.g. loop 4a with
its complement 4a'). The nucleotides were counted for
each character and the number scaled as discrete character
states ranging from 0 to 8 or by subtracting the lesser
count from the rest (each nucleotide addition counted as
a new character, 0 being the character with the lowest
nucleotide number) [See additional file 2]. A semiexhaustive search using ordered (Wagner) maximum parsimony and the branch and bound algorithm was executed in PAUP* [29]. Branch support was given by
estimating the decay index (Bremer support) and using
1000 bootstrap replicates in PAUP* [30].

Initially, the sequences were aligned in BioEdit [25] using
ClustalW multiple alignment [28] with the default gap
and extension penalties used by this program. The primary alignment was submitted to the best-fit model from
ModelTest [31] obtained by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) in order to perform a search with the branch
and bound algorithm in PAUP* [29]. INDELS were
treated as missing data and not used in any of the analyses. Bayesian inference of phylogeny was done using
MrBayes [32], Bayesian-estimated likelihood (settings
according to MrModeltest), 10 million Monte Carlo
Markov chain generations (Bayesian-Monte Carlo simulation by MrBayes sampling every 100 simulation, burn-in
10000).
A third phylogenetic analysis was carried using the Bayesian approach with combined datasets [33] using Mrbayes
3.1 [32]. In this approach, each data partition is allowed
to have a different evolution rate (using the option prset
ratepr = variable). The molecular morphometrics data
were treated as DATATYPE = standard mode and no evolutionary model was selected, but a different rate of
change for each helix was set (γ). In addition, each helix

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/90

was partitioned as if it had evolved at a different rate. The
model for the sequence dataset was searched using the
software Mrmodeltest. Two separate chains were run with
10 million generations each to test for the convergence of
the parameter estimates from two different departure
points of the search.
Morphological characters
Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) characters were
established following the methods from [13] for the
number of specimens given in the "systematics considerations" section.
