dengue virus coat proteins guided by low
resolution cryoEM structures

Abstract
Background: Dengue virus along with the other members of the flaviviridae family has reemerged as deadly human
pathogens. Understanding the mechanistic details of these infections can be highly rewarding in developing effective
antivirals. During maturation of the virus inside the host cell, the coat proteins E and M undergo conformational
changes, altering the morphology of the viral coat. However, due to low resolution nature of the available 3-D
structures of viral assemblies, the atomic details of these changes are still elusive.
Results: In the present analysis, starting from Cα positions of low resolution cryo electron microscopic structures the
residue level details of protein-protein interaction interfaces of dengue virus coat proteins have been predicted. By
comparing the preexisting structures of virus in different phases of life cycle, the changes taking place in these
predicted protein-protein interaction interfaces were followed as a function of maturation process of the virus. Besides
changing the current notion about the presence of only homodimers in the mature viral coat, the present analysis
indicated presence of a proline-rich motif at the protein-protein interaction interface of the coat protein. Investigating
the conservation status of these seemingly functionally crucial residues across other members of flaviviridae family
enabled dissecting common mechanisms used for infections by these viruses.
Conclusions: Thus, using computational approach the present analysis has provided better insights into the
preexisting low resolution structures of virus assemblies, the findings of which can be made use of in designing
effective antivirals against these deadly human pathogens.
Background
Dengue viruses (DENV), belonging to the flaviviridae
family, are the causative agents of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. The four serotypes DENV1,
DENV2, DENV3 & DENV4 rely upon Aedes aegypti mosquitoes for their transmission between the vertebrate
hosts [1]. In the recent past, there had been a resurgence
of these viruses as deadly human pathogens with about
50 million infections occurring annually [1]. Yet, no vaccines or specific effective antivirals are currently available. The conventional approach towards vaccine
development has not been greatly successful in these
viruses[1]. Due to the presence of four different serotypes
of the virus, prevention of antibody dependent enhance* Correspondence: rupali@mbu.iisc.ernet.in

ment (ADE) of the infection has turned out to be rather
challenging [2]. Hence, new avenues of vaccine development are being explored [3]. Thus, new knowledge about
the potential drug targets can be useful in designing new
antivirals.
The coat of the dengue viruses consists of two proteins
namely the envelop protein (E glycoprotein) and the
membrane protein (M protein) [4]. The E glycoprotein
consists of three domains namely a center domain; the
domain I, a dimerization domain; the domain II and an
immunoglobulin like domain; the domain III [5], as
shown in the Figure 1a. In the three dimensional space
(Figure 1b), the domain I occupies the central position,
hence the name and is flanked by the domain II and the
domain III on either side of it. The distal end of domain II
comprises fusion peptide [5], which initiates the process
of fusion with the host membrane while the domain III
has been implicated in binding to the receptors on host

cells [4]. The domains I and II are connected by four peptides that serve as flexible hinges while a single peptide
connects domain I with III. The coat protein M, as shown
in the Figure 1c, is expressed as pre-membrane form (PrM) with a glycosylated Pr peptide. During the process of
maturation of the viral particle Pr-M undergoes an enzymatic cleavage resulting into the release of Pr peptide
(Figure 1d).
Inside the host cell, during the life cycle, the coat proteins E and M of the dengue viruses undergo substantial
conformational changes. These changes lead to the
changes in their oligomeric states from being heterodimers to homodimers to homotrimers; thus changing the
coat morphology while the virus acquires its infectious
state [6]. Subsequent to the viral entry in the host cell by

receptor mediated endocytosis viral ssRNA is released in
the cytosol of host cell. Upon amplification of viral RNA
and the synthesis of polyproteins the new viruses start
getting assembled in the ER lumen. The newly assembled
particles are called as immature viral particles wherein
the viral capsid is enclosed in a rough coat. The spiky
appearance of the coat is attributed to the arrangement of
the heterodimers of E and Pr-M glycoproteins in elevated
trimeric fashion. This topology was well captured in
cryo-EM fitted model structure of the intact immature
viral particle published by Long Li and coworkers [7].
Upon release from the ER lumen and entry into the TGN
the coat proteins get exposed to the relatively acidic environment. As a result of this change in the environment, as
was observed by Yu and coworkers [8], the trimeric

Gadkari and Srinivasan BMC Structural Biology 2010, 10:17
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/10/17

arrangement of E-PrM heterodimers collapses and the
heterodimers lie flat on the surface in pairs, in end-to-end
fashion. This gives smooth appearance to the coat [8].
The change in the arrangements of these proteins further
exposes the furin cleavage site on PrM and facilitates the
enzyme action. However, the cleaved Pr peptide remains
attached to M protein in acidic pH but is released as soon
as the virus is secreted out and exposed back to the neutral environment. The coat of a mature, secreted virus
thus comprises M and E proteins and it is believed that
these proteins are present as homodimers in the mature,
infectious form of the virus. The cryo-EM fitted model
structure of mature dengue 2 virus shows primarily
homodimers of E-glycoproteins arranged end-to-end [9].
Owing to their importance in the process of maturation
of the virus and thus in infection, these coat proteins
form attractive targets for designing new drugs. The
entire exercise of vaccine development has been
immensely benefitted by the knowledge of mechanistic
details gained from the plethora of structures that are
available of these viral particles at different phases of the
life cycle. However, as most of the structures of complete
viral assemblies are available only at very low resolutions,
the structures provide only Cα traces. Hence, one gets
only a course idea about the regions participating in these
changing protein-protein interactions. We have developed an objective and automatic method that can recognize/predict protein-protein interaction residues with
high sensitivity and accuracy, given the low resolution
structures with positions of Cα atoms only [10]. In the
present study, using the above mentioned method, we
have predicted the residues on both the coat proteins that
seemed likely to participate in protein-protein interactions in different phases of the life cycle of dengue virus.
The conservation of the inferred interface residues across
the flaviviruses was further investigated to attain global
picture about the importance of these residues. The present analysis indicated a number of interesting facets of
the process of maturation besides giving the residue level
details, not reported in earlier analyses of cryo-EM data.
The new information reported in this paper will not only
impact the present understanding about these viruses but
can also be exploited in generating newer and more effective antivirals.

Results
Structures of dengue viral coat proteins

In the present study, low resolution structures of dengue
viruses have been subjected to the analysis described in
our earlier paper [10] to predict the protein-protein interaction interface residues in E and M coat proteins. The
interface residues in these low resolution structures were
inferred from the Cα coordinates only using the protocol
as mentioned in "Methods" section. Briefly, the method
for interface recognition is based on the solvent accessi-

ble surface area (ASA). Using an unusually large probe
sphere the method calculates ASA for every residue in
the low resolution protein structure with only positions
of Cα atoms available. Using the newly defined residuespecific ASA cutoffs, the method then infers the interface
residues with an accuracy of about 84%, sensitivity of
above 70% and specificity of above 60%. Based on the distribution of the ASA values of true positives and false
positives around the ASA cutoff values in the test dataset,
the method also provides confidence measures for every
residue that has been inferred to be present in the interface. The confidence score is provided on the scale of one
to ten where higher the score higher is the likelihood of
the residue being present in the interface. The score of
less than three implies low confidence, medium confidence between three and six while the residues with the
score above six are inferred to be in interface with high
confidence. Using the above mentioned method, three
different structures of dengue virus have been analyzed
here primarily: the structures of immature dengue 2 virus
at neutral pH [PDB: 3C6D][7], acidic pH [PDB: 3C6R] [8]
as well as mature dengue 2 virus [PDB: 1P58] [9]. The
structures 3C6 D and 3C6R are the models of dengue
viral assemblies generated by fitting the high resolution
structures of the heterodimeric complexes of coat proteins E and PrM namely 3C5X and 3C6E into cyoEM
electron densities[7]. All the three structures consist of
three chains of E glycoprotein (A, B & C) and three chains
of M protein (D, E & F). Hence, the interactions between
all the possible combinations of chain pairs have been
investigated using our method as mentioned above. The
inferred interface residues of the three structures were
then compared to gather better understanding of changes
taking place in these interactions, if any, during the process of maturation. The structures 3C6 D and 3C6R contain Pr-peptide (without last 7 residues) of M protein
while 1P58 corresponds to the structure of mature M
protein without first 20 residues. Hence, for the sake of
comparison the numbering in the 1P58 structure for
chains D, E and F was modified to show the continuity in
the two proteins (Pr peptide and M).
Protein-protein interactions

As mentioned earlier the dengue virus coat consists of
two proteins namely E and M. Hence, the interfaces can
be classified as homodimeric or heterodimeric where the
homodimeric interfaces are formed by interacting either
E or M proteins while the heterodimeric interfaces are
formed between a chain of E and a chain of M protein. In
the present analysis we have traced these interactions as a
function of maturation process of the virus.
Heterodimeric interfaces

Using the method mentioned above, the residues that are
inferred to be participating in the protein-protein inter-

action interface have been identified. The three structures analysed here consisted of three chains each of E (A,
B & C) and M (D, E & F) proteins. Hence, nine different
chain pairs were analyzed to obtain the residues contributing to these interactions. The residues from different
chains of the E glycoprotein participating in the heterodimeric interactions in all the three structures mentioned
above are listed in the Table 1 while the corresponding
residues from the coat protein M (Pr-M in immature
virus & M in mature) are listed in the Table 2. It is

expected that the heterodimeric interactions AD, BE and
CE will be identical. Same holds true for the interacting
residues in the M protein as well. However, for the sake of
completeness, we analyzed all the appropriate combinations of the chains and we pick up a few differences at
times, which can be seen in the Tables 1 and 2. These differences are seen in the cases of potentially weak interactions and the putative interface residues are often the
border-line cases.

Figure 2 is the visual presentation of these interacting
residues wherein the interface residues on chain A of E
glycoprotein have been highlighted (as a representative)
during the course of maturation. For instance, the panels
a, b and c of the Figure 2 depict the changes taking place
in the inferred interface on A chain of E protein when
interacting with D chain of M protein, as the immature
virus is exposed to acidic pH (panel b) from neutral
(panel a) and subsequently when the virus matures (panel
c). As can be seen in the Table 1 and the Figure 2a, b and
2c, in case of E glycoprotein strong heterodimeric interfaces were seen in all the three structures namely that of
immature virus at both neutral as well as acidic pH and
the mature virus at neutral pH. In the immature virus the
heterodimeric interactions appeared to be largely confined to the domain II with a few interactions happening
in the domain I, while in the mature form the interactions
seemed to have shifted beyond the third domain to either
stem region or transmembrane helical region of E glycoprotein. Based on the reports in past, it has been believed
that in the mature virus, upon release of the Pr peptide
from M protein, the chains of E glycoprotein engage
themselves in the homodimeric interactions [7]. However, the results presented here indicated a different picture. In case of M protein, in the immature viruses the Pr
peptide seemed to cap the fusion peptide of E protein by
interacting with the residues G (102) & N (103) of the
fusion peptide of E glycoprotein. However, in the mature
virus the M protein seemed to hold the stem region of E

and the fusion peptide is left free (as shown in red in the
Figure 2c) for interacting with host membrane upon
infection. As can be seen in Table 1 and Figure 1, all the
seven residues predicted to be participating in heterodimeric interactions in mature virus (F448, V551, T454,
M455, L458, I459 and I462) belong either to the stem
region or to the transmembrane helix region of E protein.
Thus, it appears that even the transmembrane helical
regions from the two proteins interact closely, which can
be clearly seen in the Figure 2c. Also, these residues were
not found to be involved in homodimeric interactions at
all.
Homodimeric interfaces

The homodimeric interactions (either amongst the
chains of E or M proteins) were analyzed as a function of
viral maturation process. As can be seen in the Table 3
and in the panels d-g of the Figure 2, in case of the E glycoprotein there appeared to be two patches involved in
the homodimeric interactions; one covering a part of the
domain II close to the fusion loop (Figure 2d and e) and
the other more towards the centre of the chain, closer to
the domain I in the three dimensional structure (Figure
2f). Interestingly, it was observed that the latter patch
possesses PXXP motif and the interactions through this
patch seemed to be taking place largely through prolines
and glycines (as shown in the Figure 2g). To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first indication of the involvement of this motif in protein-protein interactions in den-

gue viruses. No significant homodimeric interactions
were observed in immature virus at neutral pH. In case of
coat protein M also there were no significant homodimeric interfaces noted, as reported in the Table 4.
Conservation of protein-protein interaction interfaces

The viruses belonging to the flaviviridae family are
known to utilize similar mechanisms for infecting the
hosts although they use different arthropod vectors for
their transmission and these common features have been
targeted for vaccine development against this family of
viruses [11]. Hence, the conservation of the residues that
were inferred to be participating in the protein-protein
interactions in dengue coat proteins was investigated.

The multiple sequence alignments generated for the E
glycoprotein revealed that the fusion loop is maximally
conserved amongst the members of the flaviviridae family (Figure 3). The residues of domain II participating in
protein-protein interactions were found to be better conserved than those belonging to the domains I and III. The
PXXP motif was not seen to be conserved in most of the
members of flaviviridae except for only two namely Yokos
virus and Entebbe bat viruses for which the arthropod
host is not known (Figure 4), indicating the possibility of
the existence of species specific mechanisms of infection
within the flaviviridae family. Detailed phylogenetic analysis (Figure 5) revealed that the above mentioned two

species (Yvir and Ebatv in the figure 5) are evolutionarily
close to dengue viruses (Dvir1 to Dvir4), even closer than
other members such as yellow fever virus (Yfew), West
Nile (Wnilv) virus that use mosquitoes as vectors just like
dengue viruses.

Discussion
The coat proteins E and M of dengue viruses are being
targeted for the development of new antivirals. During
the maturation process of the viral particles, the two pro-

teins interact closely and undergo conformational
changes leading to the change in the morphology of the
viral coat. However, details of the interactions between
the two proteins have been elusive as most of the structures of the viral assemblies are available at very low resolutions. In the present analysis, by using a newly
developed method which combines recognition and prediction, the interface residues of the two proteins in the
viral assemblies have been predicted from these low resolution structures with only Cα atom positions available.

Good conservation of these residues supports our identification. A comparative analysis of the three different
structures of dengue viruses at different phases of their
life cycle pointed some of the interesting details of the
process of maturation.
In the immature viruses, where the coat proteins E and
M form heterodimers that are arranged as trimers, the M
protein appeared capping the fusion peptide of the E glycoprotein. The two residues of the fusion peptide namely
G(102) and N(103) seemed likely to interact with Pr peptide of the Pr-M directly, thereby preventing premature
fusion with the host membrane. These likely interactions
were found to be present in immature viruses, both
before and after the furin cleavage. The two residues were
found to be conserved across the flaviviridae members
thus reiterating the fact that all the members must be
using common mechanism for the fusion with the host
membrane for the release of the nuclear material.
Although, this mechanism had been reported earlier in
the literature [5], the present study points out the residues likely to be interacting in the process of membrane
fusion.
As the immature viral particles get transformed into
the mature, infectious particles, it is believed that the E
and M proteins transform from being heterodimers (EPrM) to homodimers (E-E & M-M). However, the present
analysis revealed a possibility of heterodimeric interfaces
being present even in the mature viruses (Figure 2c). In
the immature phase the heterodimeric interfaces seemed
likely to be present mainly on domain II of E and Pr peptide of M. However, in the mature form E and M proteins
seemed interacting only near the stem regions (distal to
domain III in E) and transmembrane helices, where no
homodimeric interfaces were noted. Thus, the proteinprotein interactions in the coat of mature dengue virus

can be imagined to be present in two tiers, the lower tier
formed by stem and transmembrane regions that are
engaged in heterodimeric interfaces while the upper tier
formed by the three domains in case of E, that are
engaged in homodimeric interfaces. Interestingly, no significant homodimeric interfaces were located in the
immature viruses before furin cleavage (at neutral pH). A
few intermediate homodimeric interfaces were spotted in
the immature virus post furin cleavage (at acidic pH). The
presence of these likely interactions were also confirmed
in the other structures of dengue viruses namely the
structure of mature dengue virus surface in complex with
the carbohydrate recognition domain of DC-SIGN [12]
[PDB: 2B6B] and the structure of immature virus [PDB:
1TGE) [13]. However, in case of the structure of the
mature virus bound to the neutralizing antibody [PDB:
2R6P] the above mentioned interactions were found to be
disrupted, perhaps owing to the conformational changes
brought about by the bound antibody [14].
In case of mature dengue 2 virus the two chains of E
glycoprotein seemed interacting partly mediated by
PXXP motif. The PXXP motif and other proline-rich
sequences are known to be involved in protein-protein
interactions [15,16]. In case of dengue virus 2 the region
close to PXXP motif has a few more prolines nearby.
Although, the PXXP motif is not completely conserved in
most of the flaviviruses, the other prolines in the region
appeared largely conserved. Hence, there exists a possibility of either structure driven interactions in this region
or species specific mechanisms of infection within the
family of flaviviridae. In case of HIV-1 the involvement of
PXXP motif in the interactions with SH3 domains of
some of the Src kinases has earlier been reported [17].
Interestingly, in the case of dengue 2 virus the homodimeric interactions through this motif were detected only

in the mature viruses. Thus, involvement of this motif in
the interactions with the other host proteins in the immature viruses is a distinct possibility which remains to be
explored further. In case of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
and Plasmodium falciparum the therapeutic implications
of PXXP motifs are being tested [18]. Such a possibility in
case of dengue viruses needs to investigated.

Conclusions
In the present analysis, use of the computational methods
has enabled us to predict some of the finer details from
the available low resolution structures of dengue virus
assemblies. Our newly developed method, based on the
accessibility criterion, has predicted the protein-protein
interaction interface residues on dengue virus coat proteins with significantly high confidence, solely from the

Cα atom positions in cryoEM structures. Besides "predicting" the interfacial residues known already from earlier studies the present analysis provides an extended list
of interfacial residues. Further, the present work recognizes significant changes in the assembled structures of
coat proteins, as a function of maturation of the virus. For
the first time, in dengue virus, involvement of prolinerich regions in protein-protein interactions has been suggested. The main findings of the present analysis can have
significant influence in human intervention of disease
processes mediated by dengue and closely related viruses.

Recognition of protein-protein interaction interfaces

The new method developed in house was used to infer
protein-protein interaction interfaces in the low resolution structures giving Cα atom positions only [10].
Briefly, the method mimics the popular approach used
for protein-protein complex structures with all the
atomic positions available and using the solvent accessi-

bility calculations [20]. The accessible surface area values
in these structures have been calculated using probe of
larger probe radius (of 3.5Å radius instead of default
1.4Å). In the high resolution structures a residue is said to
be present in the interaction interface if it is completely
buried in the complex form (Accessibility < 7%) and
exposed in the isolated form (Accessibility > 10%) [21]. In
our method we have defined the residue level cutoff values in terms of accessible surface area values that are corresponding to 7% and 10% accessibility values. Using
these limits the residues were then inferred to be participating in the protein-protein interactions. A confidence
score has been provided for every residue that was designated as interface residue. The confidence score for a residue was calculated based upon the distribution of the
ASA values of the true positives and the false positives in

our test dataset around the ASA cutoff value for that residue. The scores range on the scale of one to ten where
score of less than three implies low confidence (l) in the
residue being a true positive while score above six indi-

cates high confidence in designating the residue as interface residue. The scores ranging from three to six imply
medium confidence in inferring the residue as interface
residue (m). In the structures determined at very low res-

olutions the assignments of even Cα atom positions are
likely to be error prone. Hence robustness of the method
was determined for a few case study examples. The
method used to assess the robustness and the results
obtained in this case are summarized in the Additional
file 1. As can be seen clearly from the Additional file 1
table S1 the average robustness factor is about 63% and
hence, our method is reasonably robust to the inaccuracies in Cα trace.
Numbering scheme for M protein

The sequences of M protein from different structures of
dengue viruses were aligned with the sequence of polyprotein as given in NCBI and a numbering in structure
1P58 was modified to bring about the continuity in
counting as used in case of 3C6 D and 3C6R
Multiple sequence alignments

The homologues of E and M proteins in other viral species were identified by carrying out sensitive search using
PSI-BLAST [22] against all the viral genomes available till
date. The sequences showing greater that 30% sequence
identity with the query sequence were selected for further
usage. Subsequently multiple sequence alignments were
carried out amongst the selected sequences using ClustalW [23].
Phylogenetic analysis

Using the multiple sequence alignments generated as
mentioned above, a detailed phylogenetic analysis was
carried out using MEGA software version 4 [24,25]. The
trees were obtained using Neighbor joining method and
the reliability of the trees was tested by using Bootstrap
test of phylogeny (1000 replicates).
