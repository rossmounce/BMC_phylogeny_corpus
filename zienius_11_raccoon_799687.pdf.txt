Abstract
Background: Oral rabies vaccination (ORV) in rabies infected regions should target the primary rabies vector
species, which in Lithuania includes raccoon dogs as well as red foxes. Specific investigations on ORV in raccoon
dogs are needed e.g. evaluation of vaccine effectiveness under field conditions. The objective of the current study
was to investigate the efficacy of the ORV programme 2006-2010 in Lithuania by examining the number of rabies
cases and estimating the prevalences of a tetracycline biomarker (TTC) and rabies virus antibodies in raccoon dogs.
Methods: From 2006 to 2010, 12.5 million rabies vaccine-baits were distributed by aircraft. Baiting occurred twice
per year (spring and autumn), targeting raccoon dogs and red foxes in a 63,000 km2 area of Lithuania. The
mandibles of raccoon dogs found dead or killed in the vaccination area were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy
for the presence of the TTC. Rabies virus sera neutralizing anti-glycoprotein antibody titres were determined using
an indirect ELISA method and seroconversion (> 0.5 EU/ml) rates were estimated.
Results: During the study period, 51.5% of raccoon dog mandibles were positive for TTC. 1688 of 3260 tested
adults and 69 of 175 tested cubs were TTC positive. Forty-seven percent of raccoon dog serum samples were
positive for rabies virus antibodies. 302 of 621 investigated adults and 33 of 95 investigated cubs were seropositive.
In the same time 302 of 684 and 43 of 124 tested samples were TTC and ELISA positive in spring; whereas 1455 of
2751 and 292 of 592 tested samples were TTC and ELISA positive in autumn. There was a positive correlation
between the number of TTC and antibody positive animals for both adult and cub groups.
Conclusions: ORV was effective in reducing the prevalence of rabies in the raccoon dog population in Lithuania.
The prevalence of rabies cases in raccoon dogs in Lithuania decreased from 60.7% in 2006-2007 to 6.5% in
2009-2010.

Background
The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) continues to be the principal vector and reservoir for sylvatic rabies in Europe,
even though its role has been drastically reduced in
Western Europe by means of oral rabies vaccination
(ORV) [1]. At the same time, raccoon dog (Nyctereutes
procyonoides) rabies has increased in North-eastern Europe and more than doubled in the Baltic countries. Both
red fox and raccoon dog rabies cases accounted for an
even level of 90 to 94% of wildlife rabies cases in the
last decade [2]. Raccoon dogs were introduced as fur

animals in western parts of Russia in 1929-1955 from
where they spread quickly throughout Europe [3]. That
had a direct influence on the rabies epidemiology in
North-eastern Europe, especially in Lithuania where the
number of rabies cases in raccoon dogs has been similar
or even higher than in red foxes [4]. The involvement of
two component vectors can substantially alter epidemiology of the infection and might affect transmission
within and between species. Interspecies transmission is
likely to occur because of strong ecological links
between raccoon dogs and red foxes. Also, overlapping
territories have been found and animals have been
observed in each other’s vicinity [5]. However, empirical
[5,6], theoretical [7] and phylogenetic [8] evidences suggest that the contact rates between red foxes and

raccoon dogs produce a single epizootic in both species
in North-eastern Europe. Nevertheless, the overall aim
remains the elimination of terrestrial rabies from the
whole of the enlarging European Union, including the
Baltic countries, and beyond them. However, financial
concerns demand an optimal balance of cost and benefits. Consideration includes the growing presence and
spread of raccoon dogs, a significant host of rabies virus
and a species with a high reproductive potential [7].
Although classical rabies virus strains are host-species
specific they can be successfully controlled by ORV.
This has been demonstrated in experimental and field
studies, as well as during the ORV campaigns in Poland
[9,2], Estonia [10,11] and Latvia [12]. Researches addressing the control of sylvatic rabies have focused on the
development of vaccine and effective methods of ORV
of wild vector species. Most oral rabies vaccines presently used in Europe contain modified-live attenuated
virus originating from the Street Alabama Dufferin
(SAD) Rabies Virus [13]. The different “SAD” oral vaccines were used in Europe to prevent rabies in red fox
populations, but ORV programmes in rabies-infected
countries should target not only red fox, but also the
raccoon dog. Specific investigations concerning the ORV
in raccoon dogs are needed, especially in Lithuania
where rabies cases in raccoon dogs were higher than in
red foxes. The best approach for testing a vaccine is to
evaluate its effectiveness under field conditions. The
objective of the current study was to investigate the efficacy of the ORV programme in Lithuania from 2006 to
2010 by examining the number of rabies cases and the
prevalences of a tetracycline biomarker (TTC) and
rabies virus antibodies in raccoon dogs.

Methods
Study area

During the time of investigation the vaccination area
involved of the entire Lithuanian territory (63,000 km2).
Lithuania is situated along the south-eastern shore of
the Baltic Sea, it shares borders with Latvia (588 km) to
the north, Belarus (677 km) to the southeast, Poland
(104 km), and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad (255
km) to the southwest. The vaccination area was chosen
because of the natural barrier of the Baltic Sea to the
west and typical raccoon dog/red fox areas of habitation
including forests (35% of the territory), village surroundings and isolated bunch of trees, etc. combined with a
high incidence of rabies cases. According to the hunting
statistics, the total population of raccoon dogs was up to
40,000 with a density ranging between 0.3 and 1.45 animals/km2. The total human population is around 3 millions with a density of 22.7-50.5 persons/km2 within the
suburban and rural vaccination area including five
major cities with a population over 100,000 citizens.

Vaccine

Lysvulpen vaccine (Bioveta®, Czech Republic) was used
for ORV campaigns. It contains a modified attenuated
SAD Bern strain obtained from first attenuated ERA
vaccine after propagation on canine and bovine kidney
cells (biological activity 1.8 × 106-1.8 × 108 TCID50/bait
(Tissue Culture Infective Dose). Baits contain 1.8 ml of
vaccine in a blister plastic capsule sealed with an aluminium foil that is embedded in the casing that contains
150 mg tetracycline hydrochloride (TTC) as a vaccination indicator (bio marker). Baits were stored at -20°C
prior to use and during the vaccination period while
vaccines were stored in refrigerated lorries at -20°C
(monitored) during the entire campaign.
Bait distribution

ORV in Lithuanian red foxes and raccoon dogs was
organized according to the Lithuanian National Rabies
Prevention Programme and implemented in 2006. The
2006 spring (March-May) ORV campaign was organized
over 40,000 km2 area in the south-eastern and central
parts of Lithuania and 800,000 baits distributed. The
2006 autumn (October-December) vaccination covered
the entire Lithuanian territory and 1.3 million baits were
used. From 2007 to 2010 the ORV area was 63,000 km2
in both spring and autumn - 1.3 million baits per campaign were used (i.e. 2.6 million vaccine baits per year).
The baiting strategy was designed according to the epidemiological situation of rabies and investigations of
wildlife populations and hunting statistics. Baits were
distributed by four Cesna-type small airplanes at a density of approximately 20 baits/km2. The aircraft flying
lines were separated by 1000 m; the flight altitude was
lower than 250 meters and the speed 200-250 km/h
with clear ground visibility. Flight lines and bait droppings were registered on the map using Geographical
Positioning System (GPS) and data were recorded on
Geographical Identification System (GIS).
Sample collection

During the entire study period, all rabies-positive
hunted, road-killed and otherwise dead animals from
vaccination territories were included in the epidemiological investigation. A positive diagnosis was based on
laboratory examination. Brain samples were collected on
opening the skull in a necropsy room or by using the
retro-orbital route for brain sampling [14]. Field blood
samples were generally collected from the thoracic cavity of freshly killed raccoon dog. Samples were stored at
4°C for 24 hours to separate serum from clotted blood
and serum was then stored at -20°C until use for ELISA
testing. The raccoon dog lower jaws were collected at
necropsy and canine teethes with surrounding alveolar
bone tissues were isolated from each case.

ORV programme monitoring

The ORV programme monitoring was based on analyzing the incidence of rabies in wildlife before and during
ORV, testing of the occurrence of TTC and examining
serum samples of the target animals for serological evidence of rabies [15]. Information about rabies occurrence
in the raccoon dog population in Lithuania 2001-2010
was based on the data published in Rabies Bulletin Europe. The information in regard to biomarkers and serology investigations were based on the annual data
summaries of the Lithuanian National Food and Veterinary Risk Assessment Institute (NFVRAI). Rabies diagnostic techniques have been standardized internationally
[16,17] and immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) was
used for the detection of rabies virus antigen. Bait uptake
in raccoon dog was determined by detection of TTC
lines in teeth and alveolar bone. One hundred μm sections of mandibular bone were analyzed without mounting medium by ultra-violet fluorescence microscopy
(excitation filter 380-425 nm, barrier 460 nm) for the
presence of specific green fluorescence. Serological
response was determined using the indirect ELISA
method (Bio-Rad Platelia Rabies II Kit, France). Assays
were done in a 96 wells microplate, coated with rabies
virus glycoprotein as previously described [18]. Antibody
titres were expressed as equivalent units per ml (EU/ml).
Seroconversion (> 0.5 EU/ml) rates were estimated [19].
Statistical analyses

The statistical comparison in positive/negative samples
of “Lysvulpen” bait uptake (TTC) and seroconversion in
raccoon dog adults and cubs during the spring and
autumn campaigns were done with calculation Chi 2 squared (c2 test), P - probability and Fisher’s exact - statistical significance tests [20-22].

Results
ORV efficacy evaluation in the Lithuanian raccoon dog
population was based on rabies surveillance before and
during the prevention programme. In 2001-2006, 9,401
brain samples of rabies suspected cases were examined
in Lithuania and rabies was confirmed in 76.1% (22.2%
in domestic animals and 77.8% in wildlife). 36.3% of the
positive wildlife cases were raccoon dogs and 31.6%
were red foxes (details are provided in additional file 1:
Examination of suspected rabies cases in Lithuania
2001-2006). In 2006-2010, a total of 10,582 brain samples were examined. The prevalences of positive cases in
wildlife and domestic animals were 22.1% and 4.8%,
respectively (Figure 1). From 2006 to 2008, the prevalence of rabies cases in raccoon dogs and red foxes
decreased from 22.1% to 1.3% and from 15.3% to 0.8%,
respectively. The same situation was observed in 2010,
when among 1,159 rabies suspected samples tested, 13

positive raccoon dogs (1.1%) and 14 positive red foxes
(1.2%) were found. During the vaccination period the
prevalence of rabies infected raccoon dog decreased
from 22.1% in 2006 to 1.1% in 2010. In 2006 and 2007,
a total of 60.7% of raccoon dog brain samples were
found rabies virus positive, whereas in 2009 and 2010
totally 6.5% rabies virus positive samples were detected
in raccoon dogs. The hunting statistics in Lithuanian
wildlife 2004-2010 shows that 3,439 raccoon dogs were
killed in Lithuania in 2004, 2,818 in 2006, 5,554 in 2008
and 10,290 in 2010.
Between 2006 and 2010, 3,435 mandible specimens were
tested for the TTC biomarker of which 1,757 (51.5%)
were positive. The proportion of TTC positive adults
was significant higher than for cubs (chi2 = 10.14, P =
0.001) (Table 1). The stratified analysis revealed a significant difference between years for TTC results according
to age of animals (Mantel-Haenszel chi2 = 10.94; P =
0.0009). Annual data indicated that adults were more
frequently marked than cubs, although data were only
significantly different in 2006. When analysing data per
campaign (Table 2), TTC marking was found more frequent after autumn campaigns than after spring campaigns (chi2 = 16.7; P = 0.00004). The stratified analysis
indicated a significant difference between years on TTC
results according to the baiting time (Mantel-Haenszel
chi2 = 25.3; P = 5 × 10-7) as autumn campaigns induce
a better marking than spring campaigns. However, the
difference between baiting times were only significant
for 2008 and 2010.
During the investigation, 716 serum samples were
tested for rabies virus antibodies by ELISA, 335 were
positive (> 0.5 EU/ml), i.e. 46.8%. Post mortem blood
samples were more or less haemolysed (42% of samples
showed severe haemolysis, 38% were slightly haemolysed
and 20% had no signs of haemolysis). No significant differences in titres were observed in the geometric means.
Analysis of serology data (Table 3) showed that generally
the proportion of positive adults was significantly higher
than for cubs (chi2 = 6.39, P = 0.01). The stratified analysis revealed a significant difference between years on
ELISA results according to age of animals (MantelHaenszel chi2 = 5.01; P = 0.02). When considering serological results according to campaign (Table 4), the
analysis showed that serological response were better
after autumn campaigns than after the spring campaigns,
i.e. titres were higher (chi2 = 8.82; P = 0.003). The stratified analysis revealed a significant difference between
years on ELISA results according to the baiting period
(Mantel-Haenszel chi2 = 6.38; P = 0.01).

Discussion
The use of attenuated rabies virus strains in vaccines
has led to the elimination of sylvatic rabies from large

areas of Europe. For 25 years, the basic concept of ORV
focused on the red fox being the main rabies reservoir,
but during the last 5 years raccoon dog mediated rabies
expanded, mainly in the Baltic region and in Central
Europe. This had a direct influence on the vaccination
strategy. Fortunately, raccoon dogs respond well to ORV
and all available vaccines currently used are efficient in
both the red fox and raccoon dog [3,11,23]. Despite that
the majority of live attenuated or sub-unit rabies vaccines are derived from viruses obtained 50-100 years
ago [24], vaccine failures are rare. However, under specific circumstances they do occur and differences between
“street” and vaccine ("fixed”) strains may contribute to
these failures [25]. The rabies epidemiological situation
before the ORV programme implementation in Lithuania showed a rapid increasing number of rabies cases in
raccoon dogs. Between 2001 and 2005, the average
annual number of rabies cases in raccoon dogs was

322.8. In 2005 and in 2006 this number increased dramatically to 599 in 2005 and 987 in 2006. The 5 years
of ORV with “Lysvulpen” (SAD Bern) vaccine was effective in reducing the prevalence of rabies cases in raccoon dogs in Lithuania. During the vaccination period
(2006-2010), the number of raccoon dog rabies cases
dropped from 987 in 2006 to 13 in 2010. However the
investigation of vaccine baits acceptance evaluated by
the presence of the TTC biomarker and antibody titres
in raccoon dogs in a vaccination area were more informative. The TTC investigation in spring and autumn
periods in 2006-2010 ORV indicated that 46.1% of
adults and 17.1% of cubs examined in spring were positive, but in autumn campaigns the situation was different as 47.6% of cubs and 53.1% of adults were TTC
positive. This means that 20-50% of tested target animals have had an oral contact with the vaccine baits
and, possibly, were vaccinated. The hunting statistics

indirectly showed that the raccoon dog population was
increasing rapidly and a low prevalence of TTC biomarker positive animals might reflect of high population
density and greater competition for baits from other target wildlife species, e.g. red foxes in urban and suburban
areas.
Interpretation of TTC data in post mortem bone samples is difficult because this calciphilic marker is deposited in bones and teeth with a very slow turnover. As it
was used extensively during the whole vaccination programme, its presence cannot always be reliably related
to the time of consumption or a specific campaign. TTC
data can only be correlated with findings in an area if
not used within three years before ORV [26]. The TTC
concentration in the vaccine baits was 150 mg (including the “Lysvulpen”). Prevaccination analysis of the baits
showed that TTC was present in a 1:2 ratio between
epitetracycline and tetracycline. If a vaccine bait was
eaten by an animal shortly after distribution, it contained the marking potential equivalent to 91 mg TTC.
If a bait remains in the environment for several days,
the marking potential decreases by 40% [27]. Other limitations associated with the use of TTC as a biomarker
for ORV is its low rate of incorporation in bones of
adult animals (i.e. low growth rate of bones and teeth)
[28].
Titration of rabies virus antibodies is a more specific
test than analysing the TTC biomarker when evaluating
of the efficacy of ORV campaigns. During spring and
autumn vaccination campaigns, 37.1% and 48.8% of
tested raccoon dog serum samples were ELISA positive,
respectively. Similar 38.3% of adults and 18.2% of cups
had ELISA positive serum samples during the spring
while 52.2% adults and 28.8% cubs were seropositive
during the autumn campaigns. The prevalences for the

TTC bio marker and seropositivity were similar in cups
during the spring vaccinations (17.0% and 18.2%, respectively), but rather different in autumn (47.6% TTC and
28.8% seropositive).
Totally 133 serum samples (105 of 621 tested adults
and 28 of 95 of tested cubs) were negative for antibodies
but positive for the TTC marker while the opposite
situation was not observed. An ELISA test was developed for testing even highly haemolysed samples,
because the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization
test, like other cell culture based techniques, is too difficult for large scale screening and too sensitive to the
cytotoxicity associated with poor quality samples
[29,30]. The Platelia Rabies II kit was validated recently
and performed well, i.e. on specificity, sensitivity, and
repeatability [18,31]. It was found to be highly specific
in all species (more than 98%) using a cut-off value of
0.5 EU/ml [28], which simplifies the interpretation of
the results generated by the kit. The index of sensitivity
was between 92.4% and 94.5% for fox samples, and
reached 83% for domestic carnivores [18]. The analysis
of 5 year ORV programme in Lithuanian raccoon dogs
indicates that 16.9% of adults and 27.9% of cubs tested
positive for the TTC biomarker had low or undetectable
levels of rabies virus antibodies (< 0.5 EU/ml). The 9296% seroconversion rates observed in the laboratory [3]
were not reflected in the field trials.
Despite relatively low prevalences of antibody and
biomarker positive raccoon dogs, we noted a significant
reduction in rabies cases throughout Lithuania since
the first ORV campaign in 2006. Protection against
rabies despite the absence of detectable virus specific
antibodies in serum is a classical result for the recombinant rabies vaccine [32], but this has also been
described following administration of the SAG-2 oral

vaccine [33,34]. In addition, low rate of seroconversion
and low level of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies
after oral vaccination, despite a high rate of protection
after challenge, seem to be a common feature of the
canine species [35]. During the entire ORV period,
baits acceptance was significantly higher in OctoberNovember than in March-May. High differences in seroconversion rates were observed between populations
of young and adult raccoon dogs comparing spring and
autumn ORV campaigns. During the late spring and
summer periods, only 9.2-18.3% of the juvenile raccoon
dogs were protected by means of rabies antibodies. All
these animals were TTC positive. As with red foxes
[36], large numbers of young raccoon dogs may be
unprotected against rabies infection during summer
and early autumn seasons as cubs are too young to eat
baits and their maternal antibodies can prevent active
immunization during the first two months of life
[3,37]. In Europe, red fox cubs are born from around
15 March to 15 April. Raccoon dogs have a longer
gestation period than the red fox and most gives birth
in May [38]. Theoretically, this effect could be minimized by delaying distribution of vaccine baits to later
in the year (July) when cups become juvenile and thus
eat baits and have lost maternal immunity. However,
distribution of baits during the summer in Lithuania is
problematic as “Lysvulpen” (SADBern) vaccine baits
should not be exposed to temperature higher than 15°
C according to the producer specifications.

Conclusions
The positive results obtained in Lithuania demonstrated
that the 2006-2010 wildlife ORV campaign was able to
decrease the incidence of infection in the raccoon dog
population. The investigation of TTC markers and serology indicated low number of vaccinated raccoon dogs
in the juvenile subpopulation after the March-May period of ORV. The vaccination strategy of 20 baits per
km2 may be optimal, but needs some corrections in the
spring period, with more attention to the latest time of
baits distribution.
