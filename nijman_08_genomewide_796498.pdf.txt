Abstract
Background: The laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus) is an important model for human disease, and
is extensively used for studying complex traits for example in the physiological and pharmacological
fields. To facilitate genetic studies like QTL mapping, genetic makers that can be easily typed, like
SNPs, are essential.
Results: A genome-wide set of 820 SNP assays was designed for the KASPar genotyping platform,
which uses a technique based on allele specific oligo extension and energy transfer-based detection.
SNPs were chosen to be equally spread along all chromosomes except Y and to be polymorphic
between Brown Norway and SS or Wistar rat strains based on data from the rat HapMap EU
project. This panel was tested on 38 rats of 34 different strains and 3 wild rats to determine the
level of polymorphism and to generate a phylogenetic network to show their genetic relationships.
As a proof of principle we used this panel to map an obesity trait in Zucker rats and confirmed
significant linkage (LOD 122) to chromosome 5: 119–129 Mb, where the leptin receptor gene
(Lepr) is located (chr5: 122 Mb).
Conclusion: We provide a fast and cost-effective platform for genome-wide SNP typing, which
can be used for first-pass genetic mapping and association studies in a wide variety of rat strains.

Background
The laboratory rat has proven to be an important model
organism for human disease, physiology, immunology
and pharmacology [1,2]. Over the years, selective breeding for disorders has resulted in the establishment of more
than 500 inbred lines that allows the study of factors
involved in human multi-factorial diseases under controlled experimental conditions [3]. Genetic mapping and
identification of components that affect disease-related

phenotypes in the rat can be extremely useful to improve
insight in the analogous human syndromes [4].
Traditionally, QTL mapping studies in rat (Rattus norvegicus) have been limited by the availability of markers and
often focused marker development was needed to successfully link genomic regions to a specific trait (for example
[5,6]). Genome information has increased dramatically
with technological advances [7] and consequently the
number of candidate markers has increased significantly.

However, due to the phylogenetic relationship of rat
inbred strains, large haplotype blocks can be found grouping several SNPs together. The EU framework 6 programme 'STAR, a SNP and haplotype map for the rat', set
out to identify these regions [8]. Combined with new genotyping methods, cheap and versatile genome-wide genotyping has come within reach [9]. Here, we describe the
design and application of a panel or 820 rat SNPs for the
versatile and fast KASPar system (KBiosciences, UK),
which uses a competitive allele-specific PCR combined
with a FRET quenching reporter oligo. For each SNP, three
unlabeled oligos need to be synthesized, but the assay
runs as a standard PCR. After amplification using genomic
DNA as a template, the fluorophore signals are determined and genotypes are automatically determined. The
SNP panel and genotyping information for more than 30
commonly used rat inbred strains reported here forms a
versatile basis for the design of first round genetic mapping and association studies in a wide range of rat strains.

Results and Discussion
Selection of SNP candidates for assay setup
Candidate SNPs were selected from various sources (384
and 478 from [8,10] respectively) with a preference for
polymorphy between BN and SS or Wistar and an equal
physical distribution in the genome. This set was validated in duplo on BN (n = 2), Wistar (n = 2) and BN-Wistar mixed DNA (n = 4) to verify that both alleles could be
amplified and heterozygotes are easily discerned from
either homozygous genotype. From the originally
designed 862 assays, 820 worked reliably (Fig 1) – i.e.
showing clear clustering of genotypes- and subsets from
these were used for further analyses. The conversion rate
of 95% from candidate polymorphism to robust assay is
relatively high for a SNP genotyping platform. It should
be noted that we did not perform any assay optimization
in terms of oligo design or experimental conditions (e.g.
numbers of cycles or annealing temperatures) and each
assay was run with universal parameters.
Genotyping
All 820 assays were typed in duplo on a panel of BN (n =
2), Wistar (n = 2), 31 other widely used inbred rat strains
that are commercially available, 5 animals from a wildderived rat strain and 3 wild rats [10]. After removing
failed assays, 34.398 duplo genotyping assays remained.
From these assays, 49 genotype scores were discrepant
between the duplos (0.14%, clustered in 40 SNPs).
Another 20 SNPs indicated some heterozygosity while
only homozygotes were expected in inbred strains. Additionally, in 1010 cases we could not reliable score one of
the duplos (2.9%, clustered in 472 SNPs). In the final
dataset, these scores were removed and the final genotype
was dictated by the single assay that produced a clear gen-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/95

otype. Overall, 347 SNPs produced perfect duplo genotypes for all the strains without any uncertainty.
As expected, the genotyping clearly distinguished BN from
SS or Wistar (Fig. 2) since SNP design was biased to be
polymorphic between these two strains. While the outbred Wistar strain contains much more variable positions,
lack of detectable polymorphisms in a few animals can
obscure a potential informative marker. Therefore we
selected two genome-wide sets of markers. The first panel
consists of a set of 632 markers that are polymorphic
between BN and the tested Wistar animals. The other
markers are not informative in our BN/Wistar crosses, but
were chosen to cover big chromosomal gaps where no
informative markers were available for BN/Wistar. All the
other rat strains show an intermediate pattern with a
median number of 231 polymorphic markers for any pairwise strain combination, indicating that this panel is also
informative for mapping studies using a wide range of rat
strains. Figure 3 shows a pairwise comparison of allele differences between strains. In this case, heterozygote markers are included since they can be informative. In our
follow-up study, only the markers with homozygous alleles were used. All genotyping data, including information
on the genomic locus and oligonucleotide sequences, can
be explored for any arbitrary pairwise strain combination
[11].
The hierarchical clustering tree (Fig. 4) shows the relationships between the strains and concurs with known genetic
background [10] and previous studies [8]. The domesticated wild-derived rats from Groningen (wild II, n = 5) are
much more related to each other than the wild rats caught
in Utrecht, Amsterdam and Beers, which is most likely due
to genetic drift in the colony which is now maintained in
the lab for over 30 years.
Phylogenetic analysis
The genotypes of a genome wide SNP panel provide a
good data set to infer a phylogenetic structure for this
panel of inbred strains. At present, this structure is only
available based on a small amount of SNPs [10] or microsatellites [12,13]. The general topology of the hierarchical
clustering of Figure 2 is supported by a separate phylogenetic analysis resulting in a Neighbor-Joining tree (Fig. 4).
From this tree it is clear that the older nodes are only
weakly supported, which is not surprising since a combination of different strains has been used to generate the
current inbred strains. Therefore, it is unknown how
much each parental strain has contributed to the current
strains and a high level of reticulation can be expected. A
NeighborNet analysis (Fig. 5) indeed confirms this complex ancestral history and provides a more unbiased view
of phylogenetic clusters. From both figures the large
branch length towards BN is obvious. This probably

reflects the ascertainment bias because SNPs are selected
from a comparison with the published genome sequence
of the Brown Norway rat [7]. However, similar studies
using microsatellite markers, which are less sensitive to
this bias, also showed that BN is relatively far diverged
from the other rat inbred lines [12,13]. In general, a
number of clusters can be distinguished in the unrooted
Neighbor-net: 1: SS-like, 2: LUDW-like, 3: Wistar-like, 4:
BD-like, 5: WKY/SHR, 6: DA-like and the group contain-

ing BN and the wild rats. Most groups are formed by
strains that are known to be closely related. For instance
in the BD cluster, BDE is an inbred strain crossed from the
BD group and E3. Additionally, WKY and SHR are closely
related [3] and indeed cluster tightly together. The strains
clustering in the Wistar group have known Wistar background [3].

Mapping of the obese trait in Zucker rats
As a proof of principle for a mapping study, we used our
validated SNP panel in a cross with the Zucker rat strain
(originally a cross between Sherman and Merck 13 M
strains [14]), a strain which is commonly used as a model
in obesity research [15]. For this study, animals from the
Zucker strain were outcrossed with Brown Norway and F1
animals were backcrossed with Zucker rats. The resulting
BC animals were selected for genotyping based on their
obese appearance at 3–4 weeks of age. As our SNP panel

was developed to contain polymorphic markers between
BN and Wistar or SS (which shares many alleles with Wistar rats [10]), a large number of informative markers was
expected. Indeed, 205 out of 547 markers tested were
found to be polymorphic and these were genotyped on
the 239 animals from the Zucker – BN backcross. After
genotyping, the Bn/Wistar mix controls showed a complete heterozygous profile indicating that all alleles were
correctly amplified and detected. Genotype calling was
successful for 99% of the assays (48,489 out of 48,995).

We calculated the LOD scores for the backcross (Fig 6.)
and found a single high score locus on chromosome 5 in
the region 119–129 Mb. This is in agreement with the fact
that the obesity phenotype in Zucker rats is caused by a
mutation in the leptin receptor gene (Lepr) on chromosome 5: 122 Mb [16,17]. We show that a panel of 205
markers provides sufficient resolution to map a monogenetic trait to a region of less than 10 Mb. As there are more
markers available in the complete panel of 820 validated
markers, it is still possible to perform further fine-mapping in regions of interest.

Conclusion
We established a versatile genome-wide SNP genotyping
panel for the rat that is flexible, fast, and relatively cheap
(~$0.05 per genotype and only ~$10.00 set up costs per
assay). We show that this panel can be used for first round
association analysis in genetic linkage and association
studies and that it can be applied in a wide range of strain
combinations. We show that a known monogenetic trait,

like the leptin receptor locus in the Zucker strain, can be
easily mapped. Furthermore, in an ongoing ENU screen to
generate knockouts in the rat, we mapped a clear phenotype to a region on chromosome 6 with a LOD of 6.5 in a
population of 16 affected and 14 unaffected sibs (data not
shown). Although this region contains a large number of
genes, targeted finemapping with a set of additional
Kaspar markers and by sequencing, decreased the size of
the linked region and revealed 4 candidate genes. As the
rat is increasingly used in genetic studies, tools as
described here are expected to further aid in understanding the contribution of genetic variation to phenotypic
traits and disease.

visual inspection at an age of 3–4 weeks. These animals
were derived from a backcross of Zucker/BN F1 heterozygotes with Zucker animals.

SNP selection and assay design
A Perl script was written to select SNPs from genome and
rat HapMap data, evenly spread over the chromosomes
and polymorphic between BN and Wistar or SS (Fig 1.
[11] and Additional file 1). For a set of 862 SNPs, primers
were designed for KASPar genotyping using a tool provided by KBiosciences [18] based on the SNP locus
sequence (about 50 nt flanking each side of the SNP are
required for the design). The output provides sequence
information for two allele-specific oligonucleotides of
about 40 nt in length and 1 common oligonucleotide of
about 20 nt in length, all of which are standard unmodified and unlabelled oligonucleotides. Detailed information on every marker can be found in Additional file 1 and
[11] The three oligonucleotides for each assay were dissolved in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) to a 100 μM concentration, mixed together as a SNP assay mix (12 μl AS1 + 12
μl AS2 + 30 μl CP + 46 μ; Tris-HCl pH 8) and 2 μl aliquots
were distributed into individual wells of 384 well plates
by a Tecan Robot (Genesis RSP200 liquid handling workstation including an integrated 96-channel pipetting head
TEMO96). Assay plates were frozen at -20°C until use.
Each SNP was typed in a total volume of 4 μl in the following reaction mixture: 6 ng DNA, 22 mM MgCl2, KTaq,
1 μl 4× reaction mix, 2 μl pre-plated assay mix according
to the manufacturer's guidelines (Kbiosciences). Amplification was performed in Applied Biosystems GeneAmp
9700 thermocyclers running the following program: 94°C
– 15' then 20 cycles of 94°C-10", 57°C-5" and 72°C-10",
followed by 18 cycles of 94°C-10", 57°C-20" and 72°C40". Fluorescence scanning of the reactions was done in a
BMG labtech Pherastar scanner and the results were interpreted by the KlusterCaller 1.1 software (KBiosciences).
Per 384 well plate, all SNPs are amplified for a single individual and afterwards all data for each locus is regrouped
