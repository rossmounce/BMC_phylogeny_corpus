Abstract
Background: Pollens from different olive (Olea europaea L.) cultivars have been shown to differ
significantly in their content in Ole e 1 and in their overall allergenicity. This allergen is, in addition,
characterized by a high degree of polymorphism in its sequence. The purpose of this study is to
evaluate the putative presence of divergences in Ole e 1 sequences from different olive cultivars.
Results: RNA from pollen individually collected from 10 olive cultivars was used to amplify Ole e
1 sequences by RT-PCR, and the sequences were analyzed by using different bioinformatics tools.
Numerous nucleotide substitutions were detected throughout the sequences, many of which
resulted in amino acid substitutions in the deduced protein sequences. In most cases variability
within a single variety was much lower than among varieties. Key amino acid changes in comparison
with "canonical" sequences previously described in the literature included: a) the substitution of
C19-relevant to the disulphide bond structure of the protein-, b) the presence of an additional Nglycosylation motif, and c) point substitutions affecting regions of Ole e 1 already described like
relevant for the immunogenicity/allergenicity of the protein.
Conclusion: Varietal origin of olive pollen is a major factor determining the diversity of Ole e 1
variants. We consider this information of capital importance for the optimal design of efficient and
safe allergen formulations, and useful for the genetic engineering of modified forms of the allergen
among other applications.

Background
Olive (Olea europaea L.) pollen produces respiratory
allergy in the populations of geographical areas where this
plant is widely cultivated, mainly the countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea and several regions of North,
South America and Australia [1,2]. Up to date, 10 allergens, i.e. Ole e 1 to Ole e 10, have been purified and char-

acterized in Olea europaea L. pollen [3,4]. The major
allergen Ole e 1 is a protein of 18–22 kDa, displaying
acidic pI and different forms of N-glycosylation [5,6].
Besides its high homology to its counterparts in other
members of the Oleaceae family, such as lilac and privet
[7,8], Ole e 1 exhibits relevant similarity with the products
of genes Lat52 from tomato, Zm13 from maize and sevPage 1 of 9

eral extensins from Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum among other proteins. These proteins have been
indexed like members of the denominated "pollen proteins of the Ole e 1 family" (Accession number: PF01190)
within the Pfam protein families database [9]. These plant
pollen proteins are structurally related. They are most
probably secreted and consist of about 145 residues.
There are 6 cysteines conserved in the sequence of these
proteins which seem to be involved in disulphide bonds.
Although their biological function is not yet known, they
have been suggested to be involved in important events
during pollen formation, such as hydration, germination
and/or pollen tube growth [10-13].
Pollen from different olive cultivars considerably differ in
their capacity to bind IgE antibodies and to elicit an allergenic response, as tested by different in vivo and in vitro
techniques [14-17]. Noteworthy, quantitative differences
in the content of Ole e 1 have been described in the pollen
of several olive cultivars, which are positively correlated
with the amounts of Ole e 1 transcripts present in these
pollens [17]. Although these quantitative differences are
likely responsible for the different reactivity of patients to
the pollen from different cultivars, the concomitances of
other factors can not be discarded. In this context, the role
of other major and secondary allergens from olive pollen,
and the presence of divergent epitopes of Ole e 1 in the
different cultivars should be evaluated.
Ole e 1 presents numerous microheterogeneities in its
nucleotide sequence [18,19]. These nucleotide substitutions result in many cases in amino acid changes in the
natural protein [20], which have been reported to influence the binding of IgE molecules to Ole e 1 proteins [21].
However, up to date, the presence of such polymorphism
has never been related to the genetic origin of the pollen
tested. On the contrary, commercially available pollen
from uncertain origin or pollen mixes from different
sources seems to be the common material used for biochemical, molecular and immunological characterization
of allergens. The presence of an extremely wide germplasm in the olive, with over 1200 varieties cultivated over
the world [22] clearly point to this genetic variability as a
putative cause of inconsistency for Ole e 1 sequence. This
work explores the molecular variability of Ole e 1 allergen
throughout a number of olive cultivars and discusses
putative implications of such polymorphism in both the
biology of the plant and the development of the allergic
symptoms.

Results
Sequences analysis
Ole e 1 RT-PCR amplification of RNA from pollen of eight
olive cultivars, and further sequencing of three clones
from each cloned PCR product resulted in twenty four raw

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/10

sequences. The nucleotide sequences obtained were
deposited in the GenBank™/EMBL Database (Table 1).
These sequences were individually analyzed by the nucleotide-nucleotide BLAST (blastn) program [23]. Higher
identity scores included in all cases the different variants
of Ole e 1 present in the nr (non-redundant All GenBank+EMBL+DDBJ+PDB sequences – but no EST, STS,
GSS, environmental samples or phase 0, 1 or 2 HTGS
sequences-) database, including the following accessions:
X76396.1, X76397.1, Y12426.1, X76395.1, AY159880.1,
S75766.1, Y12428.1 and Y12427.1. Significant scores (E.
value threshold: 2e-99) also corresponded to Ole e 1-like
proteins from Ligustrum vulgare (X77788.1, X77787.1),
Fraxinus
excelsior
(AF526295.1,
AY652744.1,
AY377127.1), Syringa vulgaris (X76539.1, X76540.1,
X76541.1) and wild olive -acebuche- (AY159881.1). The
identity analysis involved the whole sequence of these
variants, with the exception of a short 5' fragment of 38–
44 nucleotides including the ATG initiation codon which
was absent in the RT-PCR amplified fragments as the
result of the amplification strategy used.
Different tree views were computed based on BLAST pairwise alignment of the query sequences to the sequences
searched in the databases (see Fig. 1 as an example). The
tree views generated clearly displayed that sequence differences were appreciably higher among olive cultivars than
within the same cultivar. Differences between some cultivars (i.e. Picual and Bella de España) were in some cases
higher than between olive cultivars and Ole e 1-like proteins from members of the Oleaceae family.
Detailed analysis of sequences was performed after multiple alignment of the 24 nucleotide sequences obtained,
using ClustalW software. The analysis revealed the presence of microheterogeneities at several positions, particularly in the 5' coding region and the 3' non-coding region
[see Additional file 1]. However, the main variability was
found in the sequences corresponding to Bella de España,
in which a fragment of 38 nucleotide was absent from the
3' non-coding region. The reported changes in many cases
also affected the corresponding deduced amino acid
sequences, as displayed in Figure 2.
The numerical analysis of the nucleotide and amino acid
substitutions (including conservative substitutions)
detected among the sequences obtained and those showing a relatively high percentage of identity is displayed in
Additional file 2. The percentage of identical nucleotides
between the Ole e 1 sequences ranged between 86 to
100%, whereas the percentage of identical nucleotides
between Ole e 1 and Ole e 1-like sequences from other
Oleaceae members ranged between 86 to 93%.

On the other hand, the analysis using different bioinformatic tools and those sequences described as relevant for
the allergenic response [24,25] allowed us to identify key
amino acid substitutions in the sequences corresponding
to several cultivars, which are listed in Additional file 3.
These substitutions included: a) Cys residues substituted
at position 19 in 6 sequences (3 from the cultivar Bella de
España, 2 from the cultivar Arbequina, and that corresponding to the wild olive -acebuche-) b) an extra site for
potential N-glycosylation at position 50, predicted by the
ScanProsite software within the three amino acid
sequences obtained from the cultivar Bella de España and
c), point substitutions in those sequences described like
immunodominant T-cell epitopes of Ole e 1 allergen characterized by [24] and amino acid residues implicated in
IgG and IgE binding [25].

Discussion

Amino acid substitutions were spread over the whole Ole
e 1 sequence with the exception of several regions, which
were extremely conserved throughout all the sequences
analyzed, independently of the variety of origin (Figure
2). These conserved regions included those corresponding
to 5 out of the 6 Cys conserved residues at positions 22,
43, 78, 90 and 131, and a putative N-glycosylation site at
position 111.

Polymorphism is a frequent feature for allergens molecules. Different degrees of polymorphism have been
described in the allergens of many different sources,
including house dust mites [26], foods [27,28] and allergens from different grass and tree pollens [29,30]. However, although allergen polymorphism is beginning to be
deeply characterized at the molecular level, little is known
in many cases regarding the origin of such polymorphism.
In several cases, allergen polymorphism has been attributed to the presence of multigene protein families [31]. In
other allergens, the presence of post-translational modifications may also determine the presence of multiple
forms of the allergen, as is the case of Ole e 1 [32]. In apple
(Malus domestica), up to 18 Mal d 1 genes have been characterized. Allelic diversity regarding this allergen has been
considered as a major explanation for the considerable
differences in allergenicity, widely described among apple
cultivars [28]. The high rate of nucleotide substitutions
detected in Ole e 1 indicates that these substitutions are
unlikely to represent in vitro artefacts as the result of error
incorporations by the Pfu polymerase used. The present
paper demonstrates that Ole e 1 polymorphism is clearly
linked to the cultivar (genetic) origin of the pollen analyzed, and therefore represents the basis for further
research in relation to the biological function and the
allergenicity of this gene product.

Several highly conserved sequences also corresponded to
immunodominant T-cell epitopes of Ole e 1 allergen characterized by [24] and amino acid residues implicated in
IgG and IgE binding [25]. Some of the predicted
sequences were identical to that described by [20], which
was obtained for Ole e 1 after Edman degradation. These
identical sequences were obtained from cultivars Lucio,
Menara and Picholine marocaine, in addition to the
sequence S75766, which was previously obtained in our
laboratory from an undetermined source of pollen.

It was previously reported by us [17] that pollen from different olive cultivars exhibit quantitative differences in the
content of Ole e 1, which were positively correlated with
the amounts of Ole e 1 transcripts present in these pollens. The results shown here also indicate that qualitative
differences in the Ole e 1 allergen also occur in these pollens. Three major parameters have been demonstrated to
influence the reactivity of Ole e 1 to IgG and IgE antibodies in a higher or lower degree [21]: three-dimensional
(3D)-folding, the glycan component and several point

When the predicted amino acid sequences were analyzed,
the percentage of identical amino acids ranged between
82 and 100% among the Ole e 1 sequences (84 to 96%
between Ole e 1 and Ole e 1-like sequences from other
Oleaceae members). After considering conservative
changes, these percentages raised into ranges of 90–100%
for Ole e 1 sequences, and 90–98% between Ole e 1 and
Ole e 1-like sequences.

changes of the amino acid sequence. The present paper
reports, on the basis of the sequences obtained, that modifications in these features can be related to the genetic origin of the pollen analyzed.
Sequence substitutions in Ole e 1 from different varieties
are not equally distributed over the whole sequence. Conserved regions include those corresponding to the conserved Cysteine residues at positions 22, 43, 78, 90 and
131. The absence up to date of a 3D model for Ole e 1 or

any Ole e 1-like protein with significant identity to this
protein within the PDB databases makes impossible to
determine precisely the putative involvement of amino
acid substitutions into conformational changes of the
protein, which may affect either the biological function or
the IgG/IgE binding ability of the protein. However, we
may speculate about the potential changes. Substitution
of 19C may dramatically alter tertiary structure of the Ole
e 1 protein, as the presence of a disulphide bond between
19C–90C in Ole e 1 was previously established [33]. The

conformation proposed by these authors is supposed to
be shared by most members of proteins of the Ole e 1
family, where an identical distribution of the 6 cysteine
residues is widely maintained, no matter their phylogenetic distances or relationships. As a consequence, important modifications in the reactivity of antibodies to
conformational epitopes might be expected, as the binding of Ole e 1 to human IgE antibodies has been shown to
be highly dependent on the integrity of the disulphide
bridges [21]. The putative absence of the 19C–90C
disulfide bridge in some Ole e 1 forms, could also represent an additional hint against the proposed homology
between the Kunitz protein family and Ole e 1-related
pollen proteins [34,35], since disulfide arrangement is a
typical feature for the classification of the protease inhibitor protein family [36]. The presence of free – SH groups
(corresponding to the 90C) in these Ole e 1 forms with
substitutions in the 19C residue, and therefore unable to
form the 19C–90C intramolecular bridge, could alternatively promote the formation of dimeric forms of the protein throughout the formation of intermolecular
disulphide bridges. It has been described that the SDS-

PAGE pattern of Ole e 1 frequently exhibits a faint band
of 40 kDa as a result of the presence of a 20 kD dimer [20],
which may account up to 5% of Ole e 1. Our observations
show that these dimeric forms of Ole e 1 are relatively
more abundant in the extracts of Bella de España and
Arbequina than in the rest of cultivars examined. Monomeric and dimeric forms of Ole e 1 also react differentially
to a panel of monoclonal antibodies to Ole e 1 and to sera
from olive-allergic patients (unpublished results).
The role of the glycan moiety of Ole e 1 in antibody binding has also been established [6,7,21,37]. These authors
concluded that carbohydrate moieties may constitute
determinants possessing a relative significance in the
binding of IgE from hypersensitive patients, not only in
the Ole e 1 allergen but also in other allergenic glycoproteins. In this context, the presence of modifications, such
as the putative presence of an extra site for N-glycosylation
which is reported here for the cultivar Bella de España may
represent an important modification in the allergenic
capability of the Ole e 1 protein of this pollen, which
should be further tested.

Several examples are available throughout the literature
demonstrating that sequence changes need not be extensive to significantly alter the immunological properties
(both antigenicity and allergenicity) of an allergen:
genetic variation of Der p 2 produces striking effects on T
cell responses and IgE binding [38]. Regarding pollen
allergens, recombinant Bet v 1 allergen shows reduced IgE
binding compared with its highly allergenic Bet v 1a counterpart, from which only differs in nine residues [39,40].
On the opposite hand, recombinant rOle e 1/3c isoform
of Ole e 1 [21] displays the highest degree of IgE-binding
in comparison with rOle e 1/5c, rSir v 1 and rLig v 1 forms
(the latest from Syringa vulgaris and Ligustrum vulgare,
respectively), which present a progressively higher
number of substitutions with respect to the amino acid
sequence determined for Ole e 1 by Edman degradation
[18-20]. Experimental evidence of the importance of certain positions of the amino acid sequence of Ole e 1 for
both IgG and IgE binding and the elicitation of the allergenic response has been obtained since the nineties
[21,24,25,41]. As the result of these studies, B-cell, T-cell
epitopes and IgE and IgG B-cell immunodominant
regions of Ole e 1 have been determined. It is foreseeable
that the described substitutions affecting these regions
will have a particular contribution in putative changes in
the allergenicity/immunogenicity of the protein.
Furthermore, the induction of minor changes and the
study of variants within an allergen is a commonly proposed approach to the engineering of hypoallergens. In
accordance with the results showed here, some modified
allergens, or even hypoallergenic forms of Ole e 1 could
naturally occur in some olive varieties. An important evidence of this approach has recently emerged after the
description of the generation and further immunological
testing of three hypoallergenic mutants of Ole e 1 [42].
Two out of the three mutants generated by site-directed
mutagenesis of Ole e 1-specific cDNA and produced in
Pichia pastoris (135∆10 and 140∆5 deletion mutants) were
able to strongly reduce the IgE-binding capability of sera
from olive pollen-allergic patients. In addition, the
135∆10 mutant was able to maintain intact its T cell reactivity and to induce blocking antibodies. From the
sequences analyzed in the present paper, those three corresponding to Bella de España showed point substitutions
in 135Y, and five sequences (three from Bella de España,
one from Picual, and one from acebuche) displayed substitutions throughout the 144N and the 145M positions.
On the basis of this coincidence in the altered regions of
Ole e 1, the allergen isoforms of Bella de España could be
considered as potential hypoallergenic forms of natural
origin. Experimental data obtained in our laboratory have
shown that the Ole e 1 variants from Bella de España pollen display reduced binding to IgEs from olive-allergic
patients in Western blotting experiments, when compared

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/10

to Ole e 1 forms from other olive cultivars (unpublished
results). Future analysis of epitope reactivity should
include putative modifications in other immuno-relevant
regions of the protein which should also comprise the Nterminus of Ole e 1, whose sequence has not been analyzed in this work.
The presence of differences in the reactivity to Ole e 1 displayed by patients from different geographical origin in
Spain [3,43,44] could be explained by the presence of Ole
e 1 polymorphism linked to the varietal origin of the pollen present in the atmosphere, as the major olive varieties
are precisely and discretely distributed over geographic
regions [45]. A similar finding has been described for
major house dust mite allergens, where the predominant
variants of Der p 2 have been found to be distinct in different regions [26].
The analysis of the sequences showed here indicates that
the Ole e 1 sequences from varieties like Bella de España
display a higher degree of identity with Ole e 1-like proteins from Oleaceae than with the "canonical" sequence of
Ole e 1 obtained after Edman degradation [20] or other
Ole e 1 sequences described in the literature or present in
databases. Important implications of such relationships,
particularly regarding the presence of cross-reaction phenomena are expected: i.e. the exposure to pollen from
such olive varieties (mainly anemophilous, and therefore
highly represented like an aeroallergen in broad areas)
may spread, or even trigger patient's reactivity to pollens
from mainly entomophilous, and only locally represented
plants species with low frequency of allergic sensitization
like Ligustrum, Fraxinus, Syringa and other Oleaceae
[46,47].
A large variety of morphological, biometric, biochemical
and molecular characters have been widely used to
describe and characterize olive germplasm [48]. Molecular markers include RFLPs, RAPDs, AFLPs, micro- and
mini-satellite sequences. The low level of intra-varietal
polymorphism showed by Ole e 1 sequences, compared
to the higher polymorphism present among cultivars
could be derived to the use of allergen sequences as
molecular marker for olive breeding purposes. As an
example, Ole e 1 sequences could be used as an additional
marker in order to complement the discrimination
between closely related olive cultivars, where other markers produce no or little differential patterns. The present
study shows how two very closely related cultivars are recognized like different, on the basis of Ole e 1 similarity.
This is the case of cultivars Picholine marocaine and
Menara, the later considered a clonal selection of the
former, raised in Morocco on the basis of better production, sooner come into bearing, and easier propagation
from cuttings [49]. The increasing number of molecular

markers available will help to elucidate important questions regarding the olive culture, which remain unanswered. Conflicting hypotheses exist about the
phylogenetic relationships between Olea europaea L. and
Olea-related species, between wild and cultivated forms of
Olea europaea L. and about the origin of the culture [50].
Other biological implications of the allergen polymorphism in olive pollen with regard to pollen production
and performance have been recently addressed [51].
Although much effort must yet be put into the characterization of olive pollen allergen polymorphism in relationship to the varietal origin, the advantages of the
knowledge generated are obvious, and a number of applications are foreseeable. The study of natural variants will
lead to the development of methods for improving efficacy and safety of the extracts currently in use for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, as well as the routine trials
for quality control of many laboratories. New strategies
for the design of hypoallergenic variants will be considered and natural pollen extracts from different varietal
sources could be used in order to further personalize
patient's reactivity or like natural hypoallergenic extracts,
as an alternative or in addition to the use of recombinant
allergens. Finally, advances in the breeding of hypoallergenic cultivars might also be directed by a broader knowledge of the genetic basis of this variability. The clinical
implications of allergen polymorphism in the olive pollen
are examined in detail in [51], in particularly how cultivar
differences may affect extract quality, diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy and safety, and the development of new
vaccines.

Conclusion
The sequence polymorphism present in the olive pollen
major allergen Ole e 1 is highly dependent on the genetic
origin of the pollen analyzed. Predicted Ole e 1 proteins
from different olive cultivars are likely to display different
qualitative properties. These differences have a number of
implications in olive pollen biology. They also should be
considered for optimal design of allergen formulations,
including the design of recombinant allergens, in order to
improve both their efficiency and safety.

150 and 50 µm mesh nylon filters to eliminate debris and
maintained at -80°C.
Amplification and cloning of Ole e 1 transcripts
RT-PCR procedures were used as described by [17] with
minor modifications. Briefly, total RNA was isolated from
mature pollen of each cultivar using an RNeasy Plant
Total RNA kit (Quiagen). cDNA synthesis was carried out
by using M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (MBI Fermentas)
and a poly-dT RACE adaptor (5'-GACTCGAGTCGACATCGA(T)17-3') as a primer, following manufacturer's
indications. PCR amplifications were carried out from
250 ng of the template cDNAs, by using 5 ρ mol of the
primer (5'-ACCTCCAGTTTCTCAATTTCAC-3') as forward
and equal amount of the poly-dT RACE adaptor described
above. The mixtures were denatured at 95°C for 3 min
and subjected to PCR amplification in a Progene Thermocycler (Techne) for 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 57°C for
1 min and 72°C for 1 min, using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). After analyzing the PCR products by gel electrophoresis, the bands obtained (650 bp) were cloned into
pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. At least three clones from each cultivar were sequenced.
Bioinformatic analysis of Ole e 1 sequences
Nucleotide sequences were analyzed by the nucleotidenucleotide BLAST (blastn) program [23]. BLAST pairwise
alignments and tree view were generated by using the fast
minimum evolution method and maximum sequence difference of 0.75.

Protein sequence alignments were performed by the ClustalW software [52] and viewed using the Jalview viewer
2.2 [53]. Conservation index was calculated as described
by [54]. Ole e 1 protein sequences were searched for different motifs with the ScanProsite on-line facilities at the
ExPASy Proteomics Server [55].

Key amino acid substitutions throughout the Ole e 1 and Ole e 1-like
sequences analyzed. Key substitutions analyzed include: conserved Cys residues, an extra site for potential N-glycosylation, point substitutions in
those motifs described like immunodominant T-cell epitopes of Ole e 1
allergen [24], and amino acid residues implicated in IgG and IgE binding
[25]. Deduced sequences fully identical to the canonical sequence of Ole
e 1 obtained after Edman degradation [20] are marked by a double asterisk.
