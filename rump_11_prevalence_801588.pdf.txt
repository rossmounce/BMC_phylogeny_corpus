Prevalence, distribution and evolutionary
significance of the IS629 insertion element in the
stepwise emergence of Escherichia coli O157:H7
Lydia V Rump1,2*, Markus Fischer2 and Narjol Gonzalez-Escalona1

Abstract
Background: Insertion elements (IS) are known to play an important role in the evolution and genomic
diversification of Escherichia coli O157:H7 lineages. In particular, IS629 has been found in multiple copies in the E.
coli O157:H7 genome and is one of the most prevalent IS in this serotype. It was recently shown that the lack of
O157 antigen expression in two O rough E. coli O157:H7 strains was due to IS629 insertions at 2 different locations
in the gne gene that is essential for the O antigen biosynthesis.
Results: The comparison of 4 E. coli O157:H7 genome and plasmid sequences showed numerous IS629 insertion
sites, although not uniformly distributed among strains. Comparison of IS629s found in O157:H7 and O55:H7
showed the presence of at least three different IS629 sub-types. O157:H7 strains carry IS629 elements sub-type I
and III whereby the ancestral O55:H7 carries sub-type II. Analysis of strains selected from various clonal groups
defined on the E. coli O157:H7 stepwise evolution model showed that IS629 was not observed in sorbitol
fermenting O157 (SFO157) clones that are on a divergent pathway in the emergence of O157:H7. This suggests
that the absence of IS629 in SFO157 strains probably occurred during the divergence of this lineage, albeit it
remains uncertain if it contributed, in part, to their divergence from other closely related strains.
Conclusions: The highly variable genomic locations of IS629 in O157:H7 strains of the A6 clonal complex indicates
that this insertion element probably played an important role in genome plasticity and in the divergence of O157:
H7 lineages.

Background
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) of serotype
O157:H7 has been implicated in foodborne illnesses
worldwide. It frequently causes large outbreaks of severe
enteric infections including bloody diarrhoea, hemorrhagic colitis (HC) and haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)
[1,2]. This serotype constitutively expresses the somatic
(O) 157 and flagellar (H) 7 antigens, thus, these traits
are used extensively in clinical settings to identify this
highly pathogenic serotype [1]. However some O157:H7
strains, although being genotipically O157 or H7 do not
express either of those antigens [3,4]. According to the
latest CDC report, E. coli O157:H7 infections affect

thousands of people every year accounting for 0.7%, 4%
and 1.5%, of illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths,
respectively of the total U.S. foodborne diseases caused
by all known foodborne pathogens [5].
Previously, we characterized two potentially pathogenic O rough:H7 strains that did not express the O157
antigen [4,6] but belonged to the most common O157:
H7 clonal type. The O rough phenotype was found to
be due to two independent IS629 insertions in the gne
gene that encodes for an epimerase enzyme essential for
synthesis of an oligosaccharide subunit in the O antigen.
Of the IS elements identified in O157 strains, IS629
elements are the most prevalent in this serotype and
have been confirmed to very actively transpose in O157
genomes [7]. The presence of O-rough strains of this
serotype in food and clinical samples is of concern as
they cannot be detected serologically in assays routinely
used to test for O157:H7 [3].

The occurrence of other atypical O157:H7 strains due
to IS629 insertions therefore, might be more common
than anticipated. It is generally assumed that IS elements play important roles in bacterial genome evolution and in some cases are known contributors to
adaptation and improved fitness [7]. The acquisition or
loss of mobile genetic elements, like IS elements, may
differ between strains of a particular bacterial species
[8]. IS insertion and IS-mediated deletions have been
shown to generate phenotypic diversity among closely
related O157 strains [7]. It has been shown that O157 is
a highly diverse group and a major factor that effects
this diversity are prophages [7]. However, in addition to
prophages, IS629 also appears to be a major contributor
to genomic diversification of O157 strains. Therefore, it
is questionable how much influence IS629 had on the
evolution of O157:H7, or how much importance IS629
has to changes in virulence in this bacterium.
It has been proposed in an evolutionary model previously that highly pathogenic enterohemorrhagic E. coli
(EHEC) O157:H7 arose from its ancestor enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) O55:H7 (SOR+ and GUD+)
through sequential acquisition of virulence, phenotypic
traits, and serotypic change (A1(stx - )/A2(stx2) in
Figure 1A) [9-11]. After the somatic antigen change
from O55 to O157 gave rise to an intermediary (A3)
which has not yet been isolated, two separate O157

clonal complexes evolved, splitting into two diverged
clonal groups. One of these groups was composed of
sorbitol fermenting (SF) non-motile O157:NM strains
containing plasmid pSFO157 (A4) (SOR+, GUD+). The
other was composed of non-sorbitol fermenting (NSF)
O157:H7 strains containing plasmid pO157 (A5) (SOR-,
GUD+). The latter, by a mutational inactivation of the
uidA gene, lost its b-glucuronidase activity which is the
most typical O157:H7 phenotype at present (A6) [11].
These A6 strains have spread geographically into disparate locales and now account for most of the diseases
caused by EHEC [12].
IS629 seems to play an important role in the diversification of closely related strains, specifically O157:H7 [7].
In the present study, we examined the prevalence of
IS629 in a panel of E. coli strains, including ancestral
and atypical strains associated with the stepwise emergence of E. coli O157:H7 to determine the prevalence of
IS629 and its impact on the transitional steps that gave
rise to today’s highly pathogenic E. coli O157:H7.

Results
IS629 prevalence in E. coli O157:H7 genomes

The IS629 sequence, recently found to be inserted into
the gne gene in E. coli O rough:H7 (MA6 and CB7326)
[4,13], was used for a BLAST analysis of the genomes
of 4 E. coli O157:H7 strains belonging to A6 CC
(EDL933, Sakai, EC4115 and TW14359) and one O55:
H7 strain (CB9615) (Additional file 1, Table S1). The
BLAST analysis for IS629 showed the presence of
between 22 and 25 copies in each strain along with
their corresponding plasmid (Table 1). Strains Sakai
and EDL933 shared 13 of those IS629 on the chromosome and three on their pO157 plasmids. Strains
EC4115 and TW14359 had 17 IS629 on the chromosome and four on their pO157 plasmid in common.
The analysis of the recently released E. coli O55:H7
genome strain CB9615 [14] allowed for identification
of one IS629 with an internal 86 bp deletion on the
chromosome and an IS629 in its corresponding pO55
plasmid. Neither the O55 genomic (located on the
chromosome backbone) nor the pO55 plasmid IS629
insertion sites were present in other O157:H7 strains.
The absence of the pO55 IS629 insertion site in O157:
H7 strains was expected since they do not carry the
pO55 plasmid. However, lack of the genomic O55
IS629 insertion site in O157:H7 strains is interesting as
these strains are known to be closely related [14]. Contrary to what was observed for plasmids pO157 and
pO55, IS629 was absent in plasmid pSFO157 (E. coli
O157:H- strain 439-89). However, a 66 bp sequence
identical to IS629 was observed in the plasmid which
could be a remnant of IS629. No genomic sequence is
available for an O157:H- strain at this time, thus, this

strain could not be investigated for the presence of
IS629.
IS629 target site specificity ("hot spots”) on chromosomes
and plasmids of four E. coli O157:H7 strains

The majority of IS629 elements were located on
prophages or prophage-like elements (62%) ("strainspecific-loops”, S-loops in Sakai [15]). 28% of IS629
locations were found on the well-conserved 4.1-Mb
sequence widely regarded as the E. coli chromosome
backbone (E. coli K-12 orthologous segment) [15] and
10% were located on the pO157 plasmid. In total, we
observed 47 different IS629 insertion sites (containing
complete or partial IS629) in the four E. coli chromosomes and plasmids by “in silico” analysis (Additional
file 2, Table S2). Seven of 47 IS629 insertion were
shared among the 4 diverged strains which suggest that
they were also present in a common ancestor.
IS629 presence in strains belonging to the stepwise
model of emergence of E. coli O157:H7

A total of 27 E. coli strains (Table 2) belonging to the
stepwise model proposed by Feng et al. (1998) were
examined by PCR for the presence of IS629 using specific primers [16]. Every strain of clonal complex (CC)
A6, A5, A2 and A1 carried IS629, except strain 3256-97
belonging to the ancestral CC A2 (Figure 1). Strikingly,
however, was the observation that IS629 was absent in
the SFO157 strains belonging to the closely related CC
A4 (Figure 2). Whole genome analysis of two A4 strains
(493-89 accession no. AETY00000000 and H2687 accession no. AETZ00000000) confirmed the absence of this
specific IS element in SFO157 strains [17]. On the other
hand, O55:H7 strain 3256-97 (AEUA00000000) carried
a truncated IS629 version missing the target area for the

reverse primer (IS629-insideR) located in ORFB,
explaining the lack of IS629 by PCR [17]. Additionally,
strains USDA5905 (A2) and TB182A (A1) as well as
strain LSU-61 (A?) appear to harbor a truncated IS629
which could indicate the presence of genomic IS629
found in the O55 strain CB9615. However, since no
additional ancestral strains were available for analysis,
the distribution of IS629 in these groups is at present
inconclusive.
IS629 distribution in strains belonging to the stepwise
model of emergence of E. coli O157:H7

We successfully PCR amplified 38 of the 47 observed
IS629 insertion sites in the 27 O157:H7 strains analyzed (Additional file 3, Table S2). We determined presence or absence of an IS629 element as well as the
IS629 target site in each strain (Additional file 1,
Figure S1). In accordance with the previous finding of
total absence of IS629 in SFO157, none of the A4 CC
strains harbored an IS629 in any of the known IS629
insertion sites. Likewise, it was observed for A1 and
A2 CC strains, indicating that the previously detected
IS629 must be located in some other region of the
chromosome. In A5 CC strains, only 3 of the 38 (7%)
IS629 insertion sites harbored an IS629 (Table 3).
Those sites were located on the prophage Sp12, the
prophage-like element SpLE1, and on the chromosomal backbone. Interestingly one of the A5 CC strains
(strain 1659) did not share any of the known sites
harboring IS629. The A6 CC strains shared between
6 (16%) and 21 (55%) IS629 insertions in the known
sites and two of them (IS.15: Sp14 and IS.41: pO157)
were present in all A6 CC strains. IS629 prevalence in
the A6 strains and the distribution amongst Sp, SpLE,
backbone and the pO157 plasmids did not show any

they either lack IS629 (A4) or IS629 is located in other

to be explored further using more O157:H7 strains
belonging to either A5 or A6 CCs. Besides using 25 different strains for the analysis, we also included additional Sakai and EDL933 strains. Sakai strains were one
from ATCC (BAA-460) and the other from a personal
collection (FDA). EDL933 strains were provided by
ATCC whereby strain EDL933 700927 derived from

EDL933 43895. PFGE analysis showed only minimal
changes between the original (ATCC) and the derived
ones confirming their identity (data not shown). The
analysis using the IS629 distribution also showed minimal changes in the IS629 distribution as well among the
Sakai and EDL933 strains. The use of IS629 presence/
absence in specific regions has been used before to help

detecting outbreak related strains as described by Ooka,
et al (2009) and for population genetics analysis as
described by Yokoyama, et al (2011), and appears to be
a promising and adequate technique to distinguish closely related O157:H7 strains. However, both methodologies takes no notice of the information about the
presence of the region where IS629 was inserted into.
The presence/absence of a specific region in E. coli
O157:H7 chromosomes, irrelevant of the presence of
IS629, could provide additional information regarding
relatedness among those strains.

IS629 insertion site prevalence in the strains belonging to
the stepwise model of emergence of E. coli O157:H7

PCR analysis for the presence of IS629 insertion sites
showed that sites located on the chromosomal backbone
structure were present in all tested strains from the different clonal complexes (Table 4 and Additional file 4).
However, neither A1, A2, nor A4 CC strains harbored
any IS629 in backbone IS629 insertion sites.
Contrary to what was observed in the well-conserved
backbone, IS629 insertion sites in prophages and prophage-like elements in different strains were found to be
highly variable (Table 5 and Additional file 4, Table S3).
As seen for the backbone IS629 insertion sites, some of
the phage associated IS629 insertions sites were present
in A1, A2 and A4 CC strains; however they lacked
IS629. Many of the IS629 sites on phages were unique
to the A6 CC strains (7 of 13) suggesting that they are
strain-specific. This result underscores significant differences in the presence of phage-related sequences
between the strains belonging to the stepwise model of
E. coli O157:H7.
The two IS629 insertions in O55 and its corresponding plasmid pO55 were observed to be present in only
one ancestral A2 and both A1 CC strains (data not
shown). A6, A5, and A4 CC strains as well as A2 CC
strain 3256-97 (IS629-deficient) lacked the IS629 insertion site in these regions. Interestingly, strain LSU-61

which carries multiple characteristics for O157:H7 and
is thought to be ancestral to A5 CC strains (Feng et al
2007), appeared to carry the truncated genomic IS629
insertion.
Since the strains belonging to the stepwise model
share variable IS629 insertion sites we reconstructed
their evolutionary path using this information. A parsimony tree using the IS629 target sites presence/absence
produced a tree that was nearly analogous to the proposed model of stepwise evolution for O157:H7 from
ancestral O55:H7 strains [10], with A1/A2 CC strains at
the base of the tree, followed by A4 CC, A5 CC and A6
CC strains in that order (Figure 3B).
Phylogenetic analysis of IS629 elements in the four E. coli
O157:H7 and O55:H7 genomes

The phylogenetic analysis of IS629 elements revealed
that IS629 in E coli O157:H7 can be divided into three
different sub-types (Figure 4). That is, IS629 of sub-type
I and II differ in average 4% (> 55 bp) while sub-type II
and III differed by 5% (> 60 bp). Sub-type I appears to
be most closely related to those of IS1203 (IS629 isoform) found in O111:H- [18]. IS629 sub-type II appears
to be most closely related to those of IS629 found in
Shigella [19]. IS629 sub-type III appears to be most closely related to those of IS629 found in E. coli O26:H11
[20]. Therefore, analysis of all targeted IS629 elements
showed that strains from A6 CC seem to carry both
IS1203 (sub-type I) and IS629 (sub-type III) whereby the
ancestral O55:H7 strain carries IS629 (sub-type II).
Since IS629 sub-type II found in the ancestral O55:H7
strain is significantly different from the other two IS629
sub-types (O157:H7 strains) and sub-type II is no longer
present in certain O157:H7 strains (A6 CC), these data
imply that IS629 sub-type I and III were recently

acquired by E. coli O157:H7 strains after the separation
from the sub-lineage leading to the A4 CC strains therefore not carrying IS629.

Discussion
IS elements are in general regarded as genetic factors
that significantly contribute to genomic diversification
and evolution [7]. It was determined by Ooka et al
(2009) that IS elements IS629 and ISEc8, found in the
O157:H7 lineage, serve as an important driving force
behind the genomic diversity. However, only a few genome-wide studies have been conducted to compare IS
distributions in closely related genomes. In our study we
determined that IS629 insertions in E. coli O157:H7 are
widespread distributed on the genome and differ significantly from strain to strain. Although the ancestral O55:
H7 strain carried only two IS629 with one on the chromosome and one on the pO55 plasmid, the four O157:
H7 genomes carried between 22 and 25 IS629 copies on
the chromosome and the corresponding pO157 plasmid.
IS629 does not seem to specifically integrate in
sequence-based target sites, which explains the highly
diverged flanking sites found in the genomes we examined. Sequence-specific insertion is exhibited to some
degree by several elements and varies considerably in
stringency [21]. Other elements exhibit regional preferences which are less obvious to determine [21]. IS elements frequently generate short target site duplication
(TSD) flanking the IS upon insertion [21]–this feature
was also observed for IS629 in the four O157:H7 strains.
IS629 duplicated between 3 to 4 base pairs at the insertion site and was observed for 21 of the 47 IS629 insertion sites with matching identical base pairs up- and
down-stream of IS629. A comparison of 21 TSDs created by IS629 in the four strains analyzed here did not
reveal as many similarities as observed previously by
Ooka et al (2009). The comparison of 25 bp up- and
downstream of each insertion site did not show any
similarities or patterns which would have suggested a
target preference or “hot-spot” for IS629 insertions.
Hence, insertion site specificity for IS629 remains
unknown. However, IS629 is frequently surrounded by
other IS elements (’IS islands’) and was found in the
same gene (gne) inserted in different sites [4,13].
Although no specific “hot-spot” for IS629 insertions was
observed, it seems highly possible that mobile elements
like plasmids, phages or phage-like elements could have
functioned as vectors for IS629 introduction into O157:
H7 genomes. These observations suggest that an insertion might occur preferentially in a region of the chromosome however these events may not be sequence
specific.
IS629 insertion sites located on the backbone seem to
be conserved in almost all of the strains studied here,

Page 10 of 13

whereby sites located on phages and phage-like areas
appear to differ between all strains. These findings
affirm the presence of regions of genomic stability and
regions of genomic variability that exist within O157:H7
populations and closely related strains. It is noteworthy
that sites associated with phages seem to be present predominantly in closely related strains. The majority of the
phages present in the A6 CC strains appear to be
unique to this complex. Since bacteriophages are known
to contribute to the diversification of bacteria [22], they
seem to be a major determinant in generating diversity
among O55:H7, O157:H- and O157:H7 strains. The
comparison of IS629 prevalence in A5 and A6 CC as
well as IS629 insertion site prevalence in all strains
allowed distinguishing strains from different complexes
as it has been proposed in the evolution model for
O157:H7 (Figure 1A) [11]. Adding the “same” strain
from different collections, Sakai and EDL933 allowed
confirmation of the stability of IS629 sites. Minimal
changes in IS629 presence/absence were observed and
could have occurred due to different storage conditions
and passages. Despite these subtle changes, strains
grouped tightly together on the parsimony tree. Therefore, this analysis can be used to further distinguish closely related O157:H7 strains. These findings are in
agreement with a recently described IS629 analysis in
three O157 lineages [23]. Similarly to what was determined for A6 and A5 CC strains, Yokoyama et al (2011)
determined that IS629 distribution was biased in different O157 lineages, indicating the potential effectiveness
of IS-printing for population genetics analysis of O157.
Furthermore, Ooka et al. (2009) found that IS-printing
can resolved about the same degree of diversity as
PFGE. Since A1, A2 and A4 CC strains did not share
IS629 insertions, their population genetics analysis however, remains limited to closely related O157:H7 strains.
Comparison of IS629s found in O157:H7 and O55
pointed out extensive divergence between these elements. At least three different IS629 types could be distinguished differing in 55 to 60 bp. The O157:H7 strains
carry IS629 elements subtype I and III whereby O55:H7
carries type II only. It is notable that only four
nucleotide differences were observed among seven
housekeeping genes comprising a current MLST scheme
http://www.shigatox.net/ecmlst/cgi-bin/dcs between A1
CC strain DEC5A and A6 CC strain Sakai. These two
strains, in particular, are taken to represent the most
ancestral and most derived E. coli, respectively, in the
stepwise evolutionary model for this pathogen. If the
IS629 type I and III observed in A6 CC strains resulted
from divergent evolution of IS629 type II, the amount of
changes observed among these IS types should be similar to those observed for the MLST loci examined
above. However, the number of nucleotide substitutions

Rump et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:133
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/133

between IS629 type I and III in O157:H7 from type II in
O55:H7 was 10-fold higher. Thus, the differences
between IS629 types are more significant than those
observed for housekeeping genes. This indicates that
IS629-type II was most likely lost and IS629-type I and
III were acquired independently in distinct E. coli O157:
H7 lineages. Further supporting this thesis was the fact
that one of the IS629 type II copies was found on the
pO55 plasmid, which was subsequently lost during evolution towards O157:H7 strains. The other IS629 copy
in O55, with a unique internal deletion, is located in the
chromosome and appears to be part of a mobile region
[24] which is absent in O157:H7 strains.
Interestingly, the ancestral IS629-deficient A2 O55:H7
strain 3256-97 is also lacking both IS629 associated
regions found in the O55:H7 strains. Our analysis of
common IS629 target sites demonstrated that strain
3256-97 seems to be more closely related to A4 and A5
CC strains than other A1 and A2 strains. Therefore, it is
likely that IS629 has been lost in strain 3256-97 as well as
in the hypothetical A3 precursor. These results may indicate that strain 3256-97 or a similar strain lacking IS629
might have given rise to IS629-deficient A4 CC strains.
E. coli O157:H7 strains carry multiple IS629 copies
while the non-pathogenic K-12 strain lacks IS629 but
carries other IS elements. Other pathogenic E. coli
strains, amongst the top six non-O157 STEC O26:H11,
O111:H- and O103:H2 [25], also harbor various copies
of IS629 elements in their genomes. Genome sequences
for the other three most important pathogenic nonO157 STEC; O45, O145, and O121 are not available to
date thus the presence of IS629 elements is unknown.
Interestingly, they also share the same reservoir with
O157:H7 (e.g. cattle), shiga-toxins, haemolysin gene cluster, other virulence factors and several phages and
phage-like elements [25]. Ooka et al (2009) postulated
that IS-related genomic rearrangements may have significantly altered virulence and other phenotypes in O157
strains. These findings suggest that IS629 might not
only have a great impact in their genomic evolution but
might increase the pathogenicity of those strains as well.

Conclusions
The genomic sequence analysis showed that IS629 insertion sites exhibited a highly biased distribution. IS629
was much more frequently located on phages or prophage-like elements than in the well-conserved backbone
structure, which is consistent with the observations by
Ooka et al (2009). IS629 was found to be present in the
A1 and one of two A2 CC strains examined as well as
in all the O157:H7 strains of A5 and A6 CC, however it
was totally absent in the 6 examined SFO157 strains of
A4 CC. The A4 CC strains are related to but on a divergent evolution pathway from O157:H7. These results

Page 11 of 13

suggest that the absence of IS629 in A4 strains probably
occurred during the divergence, but it is uncertain if it
contributed to the divergence. Overall, IS629 had great
impact on the genomic diversification of the E. coli
O157:H7 lineage and might have contributed in the
emergence of the highly pathogenic O157:H7.

Methods
Bacterial strains

The bacterial strains used in this study are listed in
Table 2 and were chosen to represent typical EHEC and
EPEC strains from the different clonal complexes from
the evolution model for E. coli O157:H7 [11] with different serotypes (O157:H7, O157:H- and O55:H7) and different characteristics (e.g. b-glucuronidase activity
(GUD), sorbitol fermentation (SOR).
“In silico” analysis

Various E. coli O157:H7 and non-O157 chromosomes
and pO157 plasmids (Additional file 2, Table S1)
deposited at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database were queried for IS629 (accession number X51586) presence and insertion loci using
BLAST analysis. Furthermore, approximately 400 bp upand downstream of the flanking regions of each new
localized IS629 in the chromosome and the plasmids
were compared with each other. We investigated whether
an IS629 was also present in the other strains or appears
exclusively in either the chromosome or the plasmids.
Nucleic acid extraction and determination
of IS629 presence

DNA used as the template for PCR was prepared from
overnight cultures grown in Luria-Bertani Broth (LB)
and purified using the MASTER PURE™ DNA Purification kit (EpiCentre, Madison, WI). For determining
IS629 presence in the E. coli strains, we conducted a
“touchdown” multiplex PCR using IS629-specific
primers targeting conserved regions of the insertion
element previously described by Ooka et al. (2009): IS629insideF (5’- GAACGTCAGCGTCTGAAAGAGC-3’) and
IS629-insideR (5’- GTACTCCCTGTTGATGCCAG-3’)
and specific 16S rDNA primers: SRM86 (5’- AGAAGCACCGGCTAACTC -3’) [7] and SRM87 (5’- CGCATTTCACCGCTACAC-3’) [26]. The latter were used as
internal amplification control. PCR amplifications were
performed using 0.5 ng of template DNA and in a final
volume of 30 μl. The PCR reaction mixture contained 2.5
U of HotStart Taq Polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), 1X
Taq polymerase buffer, 2.0-3.5 mM MgCl2, 400 μM each
deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), 300 nM each IS629
primer pair, and 300 nM each 16S rDNA primer pair. The
“touchdown” PCR [27] conditions were: 1 cycle of 95°C
for 15 min; 10 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 69-59°C (-1°C/cycle)

Rump et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:133
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/133

for 15 s and 72°C for 1:30 min; followed by 35 cycles consisting of 95°C for 30 s, 58°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 1.5
min, and a final extension at 72°C for 4 min. Amplicons
were visualized on a 1% agarose gel in Tris-Borate EDTA
(TBE) buffer containing 0.3 μg/ml ethidium bromide.
Determination of IS629 specific location and IS629
insertion sites

For the analysis of the IS629 insertion sites, primers
were designed to target the different IS629 flanking
regions in each strain and the plasmids. The presence/
absence of amplicons would determine the presence/
absence of the specific insertion sites and the sizes of
each amplicons would indicate the presence/absence of
IS629 at those loci. Potential primers were analyzed for
their ability to produce stable base pairing with the template using the NetPrimer software (PREMIER Biosoft
International http://www.premierbiosoft.com/netprimer/
netprlaunch/netprlaunch.html). The size of the PCR
products were between 1,500 - 2,500 bp in the case of
IS629 presence in a strain or between 200 - 800 bp in
the case that the specific flanking region existed in the
chromosome but did not contain an IS629 element.
Each multiplex PCR contained a set of 16S rDNA primers as PCR internal control (either set SRM86/SRM87
or VMP5 (5’-AGAAGCACCGGCTAACTC-3’) and
VMP6 (5’-CGCATTTCACCGCTACAC-3’) [28]), and
IS629 insertion site specific primers. The list of the 40
primer combinations for each IS629 site and PCR conditions can be found in Additional file 5, Table S4.
IS629 presence/absence parsimony tree analysis

IS629 PCR fragments sizes indicating IS629 presence/
absence and IS629 target site presence/absence identified
by PCR using primers specific for each IS629 observed in
4 E. coli O157:H7 genomes were entered as binary characters (+ or -) into BioNumerics version 6.0 (Applied
Maths, Saint-Martens-Latem, Belgium). IS629 presence/
absence and IS629 target site presence/absence were
used to create a phylogenetic parsimony tree rooted to
A5 CC strains for A5/A6 CC strains analysis (Figure 1B)
and statistical support of the nodes was assessed by 1000
bootstrap re-sampling. IS629 target site presence/absence
were used to create a phylogenetic parsimony tree rooted
to A1/A2 CC strains for strains of the entire model (A1 A6) (Figure 1C) and statistical support of the nodes was
assessed by 1000 bootstrap re-sampling.
IS629 phylogenetic analysis

Minimum evolution tree for IS629 sequences present in
4 E. coli O157:H7 genomes, two IS629 in O55:H7 genome, IS629 sequences from Shigella, two other IS629
isoforms (IS1203 and IS3411), and ISPsy21 (a member

Page 12 of 13

of the IS3 family and sharing only 68% homology with
IS629) as out-group (Pseudomonas syringae pv. savastanoi TK2009-5) was constructed using Mega version 4.0
[29]. The evolutionary distances were computed using
the Kimura 2-parameter method [30] and are in the
units of the number of base substitutions per site. All
positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset (Complete deletion option).
There were a total of 299 positions in the final dataset.
The statistical support of the nodes in the ME tree was
assessed by 1000 bootstrap re-sampling.
