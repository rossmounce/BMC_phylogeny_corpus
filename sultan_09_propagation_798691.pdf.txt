Abstract
Backgrounds: The aim of this study was to confirm the propagation of various canine distemper
viruses (CDV) in hamster cell lines of HmLu and BHK, since only a little is known about the
possibility of propagation of CDV in rodent cells irrespective of their epidemiological importance.
Methods: The growth of CDV in hamster cell lines was monitored by titration using
Vero.dogSLAMtag (Vero-DST) cells that had been proven to be susceptible to almost all field
isolates of CDV, with the preparations of cell-free and cell-associated virus from the cultures
infected with recent Asian isolates of CDV (13 strains) and by observing the development of
cytopathic effect (CPE) in infected cultures of hamster cell lines.
Results: Eleven of 13 strains grew in HmLu cells, and 12 of 13 strains grew in BHK cells with
apparent CPE of cell fusion in the late stage of infection. Two strains and a strain of Asia 1 group
could not grow in HmLu cells and BHK cells, respectively.
Conclusion: The present study demonstrates at the first time that hamster cell lines can
propagate the majority of Asian field isolates of CDV. The usage of two hamster cell lines suggested
to be useful to characterize the field isolates biologically.

Background
Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a negative-strand RNA
virus that belongs to the genus Morbillivirus in the family
Paramyxoviridae. The CDV induce distemper in dogs, raccoons [1] and ferrets [2]. Outbreaks of distemper in seals
on Lake Baikal [3], in leopards and other feline animals in
zoos [4], and in lions in the Serengeti National Park [5],
indicate additional animal hosts other than the generally
accepted hosts.

CDV has been isolated by a few cell lines other than the
cells derived from dog as follows. Vero [6] and B95a B-cell
line [7] were derived from monkey, and MV1Lu lung cells
were derived from mink [8]. Recently, the gene of dog signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (also known as
dog SLAM or CD150) [9], was introduced into Vero cells
and Vero.dogSLAMtag (Vero-DST) cells were established
[10]. By Vero-DST cells, various field strains were isolated
[10-12]. Thus there are only a few cell lines derived from
other than generally accepted hosts.

During a study on the molecular characterization of the
hemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) protein genes using
mouse retrovirus vectors, the hamster HmLu cell line was
suggested to be susceptible to CDV infection. Hamsters
are not generally accepted hosts and there is little knowledge of the propagation of CDV in rodent cells.

Methods
Cells and Viruses
Vero-DST cells were established as described above [10].
HmLu cells were derived from hamster lung cells [13].
BHK cells were derived from baby hamster kidney cells
[14]. All cells were passaged and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (D-MEM; autoclavable;
Nissui Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a CO2 incubator
at 37°C.

Thirteen strains of CDV were isolated and propagated,
one or a few times, in Vero-DST cells and stored at -80°C
until use. Specimens were collected from diseased dogs in
Japan except for strain Th12, which was sampled in Thailand. Nine strains were newly isolated except for strains of
007 Lm, 009L, 011C [11], and Ac96I [12]. The phylogenetic relationship of nine new strains were determined by
the sequencing of their (H) genes [15] where strains 55L,
M25CR, 50Con and 50Cbl were assigned as members of
Asia 2 group, while strains Th12, 50Sc, 81ND, 82Con and
83mLN were assigned as members of Asia 1 group. The
vaccine strain of Onderstepoort (Ond) was used as a control.
Virus titration
Vero-DST cells were seeded on 24-well multi-plates (Sumitomo-Bakelite, Tokyo, Japan) at a concentration of 1 ×
105 cells per well and incubated overnight. After the
removal of media, the cultures were overlaid with 0.1 ml
of each serial 10-fold-diluted virus suspensions in duplicate manner, and incubated for 1 h with rocking at 15min intervals. After virus adsorption, the suspensions
were removed by suction and the cultures were washed
once with culture media. The cultures were then overlaid
with medium (1 ml) containing 1% methyl cellulose4,000 (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan; methyl cellulose
media), incubated for 3 days, then fixed with formalin,
stained with crystal violet solution, and plaques were
counted. Virus titers were shown as mean value after two
independent titrations which were carried out in a duplicate form.
Passage of HmLu and BHK cells infected with various CDV
strains
Sub-confluent cultures of HmLu or BHK cells were
infected with strains Ond, 007Lm, 55L, 009L, M25CR,
011C, 50Con, 50Cbl, Ac96I, Th12, 50Sc, 81ND, 82Con,

or 83mLN of CDV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 1
in culture bottles. When the cultures became confluent
(usually after 3-day incubation) the supernatant media
was harvested, centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min to
remove cell debris, aliquotted, and stored at -80°C until
use as cell-free virus. The residual cells were liberated by
trypsinization, and one tenth of the liberated cells underwent further cultivation, while the residual nine-tenths
were used to liberate the cell-associated virus by freezing
at -80°C, thawing under flowing water, and centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min to remove cell debris. The
supernatant fraction was aliquotted and stored at -80°C
until use as cell-associated virus. The cycle of passage was
repeated, and all cell-free and cell-associated virus samples were titrated on Vero-DST cells.

Results
Propagation of CDV strains in HmLu and BHK cells
To find out whether the hamster cell lines can propagate
CDV, a study was started with HmLu cells and CDV strains
of Ond and 007Lm (Asia 2 group). When the HmLu cells
were infected with the Ond strain at a MOI = 1, the virus
induced the cytopathic effect (CPE) of giant cell formation, almost throughout the entire culture within 3-days.
The obtained titers of cell-free and cell-associated viruses
were 1.3 and 0.6 × 106 PFU/ml, respectively, at the 1st passage. The passage of infected cells resulted in a low cell
density and low virus titer, as shown in Fig. 1. The cellassociated virus titer obtained from HmLu cells infected
with the 007Lm strain was 2 × 102 PFU/ml at the 1st passage. The cell-free virus showed a titer that was about 10fold lower (1.5 × 101 PFU/ml) than that of the cell-associ-

(open diamond) and cell-associated viruses of Ondestepoort
(black circle), or 007Lm (black diamond) and were titrated
on Vero-DST cells as described in Materials and Methods.
The obtained virus titers (PFU/ml) were plotted against passages number.

ated. The cell-free and cell-associated titers increased gradually up to the 9th passage, and the highest virus titer (1.3
× 106 PFU/ml) was found for the cell-associated virus
obtained at the 9th passage. This score is comparable with
that obtained for HmLu cells infected with the Ond strain.
The persistent infection lasted during passages, although
the CPE of giant cell formation appeared and increased
gradually after the 4th passage. The infected culture could
be transferred up to the 15th passage. On the other hand,
the BHK cells infected with strain 007Lm were revealed to
be transferred up to the 6th passage (data not shown).
According to these results, seven passages for infected
HmLu and five passages for infected BHK cultures were
preset for testing residual 12 CDV strains.

Characterization of the CPE induced in hamster cells
infected with CDV isolates
The culture of HmLu cells infected with strain 007Lm
showed no CPE by the 3rd passage as if strain 007Lm
induced persistent infection. However, the culture
showed CPE of giant cell formation (Fig. 2A) after the 4th
passage, and the population of giant cells increased gradually with increasing numbers of passages as the giant
cells detached from the substrate as floating giant cells.
This giant cell formation did not proceed to the formation
of typical syncytia of fusion plaques that were observed in
infection of Vero-DST cells with strain 007Lm by the 15th
passage although the population of giant cells increased.
At the final stage, the culture showed extensive spread of
giant cell formation and floating giant cells (round cells)
throughout the entire culture (Fig. 2B). With regard to the
infected BHK culture, similar process of CPE development
was observed (Fig. 2A and 2B). To characterize giant cell
formation, the culture of HmLu cells infected with strain
007Lm was liberated by trypsinization at the 8th passage
and plated into dishes to form colonies.

As shown in Table 1, all strains of Asia 2 group could grow
in both HmLu and BHK cells. Among the strains of Asia 1
group, Ac96I could not grow in either HmLu or BHK cells
and Th12 grew in BHK cells but not in HmLu cells. Moreover, strains 50Sc, 81ND, 82Con, and 83mLN could grow
in either HmLu or BHK cells. The cultures of BHK cells
infected with strains 50Cb1, Th12, or 81ND could not be
transferred over 3 passages, the cultures of both HmLu
and BHK cells infected with strain 82Con could not be
transferred over 4 passages, and the cultures of HmLu cells
infected with strains 55L, 009L, 50Sc, 81ND, and 83mLN
also could not be transferred over 7 passages because the
massive detachment of giant cells occurred, resulting in a
low cell density with extensive appearance of CPE. A typical observation was that strain Th12 grew in BHK cells in
a very short period of 3 passages but not in HmLu cells.

The dishes were incubated for 7 days. Colonies of various
sizes and morphologies were obtained and classified into
three categories as shown in Fig. 3(A - C). Colonies with
normal cell morphology, which represented the majority
of colonies, as shown in Fig. 3A, hybrid colonies composed of normal and giant cell morphology are shown in
Fig. 3B and 3B' (low incidence), and colonies composed
of giant cells are shown in Fig. 3C (low incidence). Among
the giant cells, a typical body, which seemed to be a nucle-

BHK cells had a tendency to propagate field CDV strains
more efficiently than HmLu cells as shown in the cases of
strains 50Cbl, Th12 and 81ND (Table 1) and strain
007Lm. Fujita et al. [16] reported that BHK cells showed a
low susceptibility to recombinant Yanaka virus but
showed a high level CDV transcription. This high level
CDV transcription might correlate to the rapid destruction
of BHK cultures infected with strains 007Lm, 50Cbl, Th12
and 81ND when compared with the infected cultures of
HmLu cells. However, strain 82Con grew in HmLu cells as
rapidly as in BHK cells. Strain Ac96I could not grow in
both HmLu and BHK cells and Th12 could grow in BHK
cells but not in HmLu cells although it is not known what
factor controls the growth of CDV in hamster cells at
present. Thus, each virus strain behaved differently against
the two hamster cell lines (Table 1). These results indicate
that the usage of two hamster cell lines is useful to characterize various field strains by their biological nature.
In this report, all of Asian isolates induced no CPE at the
initial stage of infection in the hamster cell lines of both
HmLu and BHK, and this result is coincided with the
reports [11,17] that both groups of Asia 1 and Asia 2
showed no CPE in Vero cells at the first infection. However, repeated passage of infected hamster cells resulted in
the fact that even Asia 1 isolates except for Ac96I, could
grow in hamster cell lines with apparent CPE of giant cell
formation. Thus, it is necessary to characterize the infection to a cell line not only at the initial stage but also at
the late stage of infection.
The HmLu cells infected with 007Lm had a high passage
level of 15 passages, whereas the HmLu cells infected with
Ond strain induced massive detachment of giant cells
after the 1st passage and were unable to be transferred further. These observations indicated that the development
of CPE of giant cell formation in the 007Lm-infected
HmLu cells was very slow. The slow development of CPE
enabled the observation of various types of colonies at the
8th passage as shown in Fig. 3. Giant cells seemed to be
produced gradually from the infected cells with normal
shape by cell fusion. Once giant cells were formed, they
had a tendency to detach from the surface of the dish and
turn into the floating giant cells.

Conclusion
This report demonstrated at the first time that the majority
of Asian field isolates tested were propagated in hamster

cell lines of HmLu and BHK. Each virus strain behaved
differently against the two cell lines. Since there is no
effective method to characterize the field isolates of CDV
biologically, the usage of two hamster cell lines can be
useful.
