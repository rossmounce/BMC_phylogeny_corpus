Abstract
Background: Understanding the mechanisms that control species genetic structure has always
been a major objective in evolutionary studies. The association between genetic structure and
species attributes has received special attention. As species attributes are highly taxonomically
constrained, phylogenetically controlled methods are necessary to infer causal relationships. In
plants, a previous study controlling for phylogenetic signal has demonstrated that Wright's FST, a
measure of genetic differentiation among populations, is best predicted by the mating system
(outcrossing, mixed-mating or selfing) and that plant traits such as perenniality and growth form
have only an indirect influence on FST via their association with the mating system. The objective of
this study is to further outline the determinants of plant genetic structure by distinguishing the
effects of mating system on gene flow and on genetic drift. The association of biparental inbreeding
and inbreeding depression with population genetic structure, mating system and plant traits are also
investigated.
Results: Based on data from 263 plant species for which estimates of FST, inbreeding (FIS) and
outcrossing rate (tm) are available, we confirm that mating system is the main influencing factor of
FST. Moreover, using an alternative measure of FST unaffected by the impact of inbreeding on
effective population size, we show that the influence of tm on FST is due to its impact on gene flow
(reduced pollen flow under selfing) and on genetic drift (higher drift under selfing due to
inbreeding). Plant traits, in particular perenniality, influence FST mostly via their effect on the mating
system but also via their association with the magnitude of selection against inbred individuals: the
mean inbreeding depression increases from short-lived herbaceous to long-lived herbaceous and
then to woody species. The influence of perenniality on mating system does not seem to be related
to differences in stature, as proposed earlier, but rather to differences in generation time.
Conclusion: Plant traits correlated with generation time affect both inbreeding depression and
mating system. These in turn modify genetic drift and gene flow and ultimately genetic structure.

Background
One achievement of empirical population genetic studies
is the survey of the genetic diversity of thousands of plant
and animal species using molecular markers, first on the
basis of proteins and then of DNA. This "immense outpouring of data on genetic variation" has been considered
to be both a milestone, because any type of organism
could be investigated using standardised molecular methods, and a "millstone around our neck", because it
resulted in the "depauperization of the diversity of empirical work in evolutionary genetics" [1]. Notwithstanding
possible side-effects on the development of the field, such
a large dataset of species-level microevolutionary
approaches should allow addressing important issues in
comparative biology. However, few studies have taken
advantage of this rich but heterogeneous data for drawing
inferences on patterns of genetic variation and on their
relation with species attributes. Among the few attempts
to relate genetic diversity statistics to species attributes,
some influential studies have dealt with plants (e.g. [25]). Unfortunately, these early studies neither accounted
for phylogenetic inertia in the data nor for potentially
confounding covariates, making it difficult to identify
causal mechanisms. We recently showed that when
accounting for phylogenetic signal and covariation
between traits, the only species trait that consistently predicted genetic structure was the mating system: selfing
species tend to build up more genetic structure than outcrossing species [6]. Mating system was also shown to be
the best predictor of plant genetic diversity [7]. However,
mating system was not quantified precisely in these studies [2-4,7]. Furthermore, plant traits could affect genetic
structure indirectly, via their effect on mating system, so
predicting mating system itself on the basis of plant traits
is of interest. Here we revisit the interrelations between
population genetic structure, mating system and plant
traits using a quantitative estimate of the mating system
(i.e. outcrossing rate), while controlling phylogenetic signal and using traits as covariates.
Species genetic structure reflects the balance between
divergence processes and cohesion processes among populations. In particular, gene flow limits genetic structure,
whereas genetic drift increases genetic structure. Hence,
traits affecting mating system and dispersal should affect
genetic structure by modifying the drift/migration equilibrium. Since traits affecting genetic structure often
evolve conservatively during evolution, measures of
genetic structure typically present a strong phylogenetic
signal (see e.g. [6]). This does not imply that FST [8], which
measures the mean proportion of the total genetic variance contained in a population, is an intrinsically 'heritable' feature of species. In fact, it is expected to approach
equilibrium on a relatively short time scale [9], compared
to speciation events. Its strong phylogenetic inertia is due

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/177

to the fact that related species share similar traits influencing the distribution of genetic diversity. Once phylogeny
is controlled for when testing relationships between plant
traits and genetic structure, FST (as measured at biparentally-inherited nuclear markers) has been shown to
depend mostly on the inbreeding coefficient (FIS) and the
mating system, whereas life form or perenniality appear to
affect genetic structure only indirectly, through their
effects on the mating system and inbreeding [6].
Mating system and inbreeding have long been known to
influence
species
population
genetic
structure
[2,4,6,10,11]. But only qualitative classifications of plant
mating systems (selfed, mixed and outcrossed) have been
used to study this relationship [2,4,6]. The classification
of mating system on the basis of floral morphology can
lead to false attributions and does not provide any quantitative measure of actual outcrossing rates. Direct analyses of offspring genotypic data at several gene loci allow a
much more precise quantification of multilocus outcrossing rates tm[12]. Such quantitative measures of mating system should help study the association between plant
traits, mating system, inbreeding and FST.
Mating system can affect the distribution of genetic diversity in different ways, in particular by its effect on pollenmediated gene flow and by its effect on genetic drift
within population. This is because selfing can (i) lower
gene flow among populations by limiting pollen-mediated gene flow (as pollen used for self-pollination does
not contribute to gene flow) and (ii) increase inbreeding,
thereby reducing effective population size Ne and increasing genetic drift [13]. Which of these two effects predominates in plants is typically not known. The definition of
an alternative measure of FST not affected by the reduction
of Ne due to inbreeding would help to evaluate their
respective influence.
Mating system is related with inbreeding in a complex,
interdependent way: while outcrossing rate should have a
strong impact on inbreeding, this factor, in turn, directly
influences the evolution of the mating system. Indeed, the
main factor controlling mating system evolution appears
to be inbreeding depression, the detrimental effects of
close inbreeding on fitness [14]. In plants, inbreeding
depression affects inbred (especially selfed) progeny, particularly during the earliest stages of the plant's life cycle
[15]. Hence, the inbreeding coefficient (FIS) of adult
plants integrates information not only on selfing rate [16]
but also on inbreeding depression. The selective removal
of inbreds limits genetic drift and hence indirectly genetic
structuring. When pollen and seed dispersal are limited,
resulting in intra-population structure, FIS can also be
affected by biparental inbreeding. Hence, comparing the
expected inbreeding coefficient due to selfing, Fe, with the

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:177

FIS observed at the adult stage allows testing the impact of
both inbreeding depression and biparental inbreeding on
population genetic structure.
Inbreeding depression could depend on plant traits and is
typically stronger in perennials than in annuals [17-19].
Among the models proposed to explain the relationships
between plant traits and inbreeding depression, the Τmodel of plant mating system evolution states that the
per-generation mutation rate of a plant is a function of the
number of mitoses that occur from zygote to gamete.
High-Τ plants (typically, high-stature plants) should accumulate more mutations during their lifetime and their offspring should therefore show more inbreeding depression
than low-Τ plants (low-stature plants) [17], thereby
selecting for outcrossing. Alternatively, mating system
could depend not so much on the per-generation mutation rate but on generation time per se [20]. This is
expected if inbreeding depression had particularly detrimental effects in long-lived plants (for instance because it
has multiplicative effects across years, [21]). Finally, generation time rather than stature could drive mating system
evolution if the survival of short-lived plants but not of
long-lived ones would depend on reproductive assurance
conferred by selfing.
In this study, we have gathered data on the partitioning of
diversity within and among populations (FST), on individual inbreeding (FIS), on the mating system (based on a
quantitative estimate, the outcrossing rate tm), and on
some key plant traits (stature, growth form, perenniality,
mode of pollen dispersal) for 263 plant species. A characterization of the correlation structure among these variables using phylogenetically-controlled regression
methods should provide insights into the determinants of
plant genetic structure. In addition, using an alternative to
FST that controls for the impact of inbreeding on genetic
differentiation, we will attempt to distinguish the effects
of the mating system on gene flow and on genetic drift.
Finally, we will test the occurrence of biparental inbreeding and of selection against inbreds to assess their relevance in explaining the relationships between population
genetic structure, mating system and plant traits.

Methods
The database
A systematic search in the peer-reviewed literature [17,22]
yielded 263 plant species for which the following information were available: (i) genetic structure at nuclear markers, as measured by the FST index, (ii) inbreeding (or
heterozygote deficit), as measured by the FIS index, (iii) mating system, as measured by the multilocus outcrossing rate
tm (additional file 1). Estimates of outcrossing rate that
exceeded 1 (which is technically possible using unbiased
estimators) were set to 1 because all reported values did

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/177

not use the same method of estimation. FST estimates were
based on allozymes for 216 species and on nuclear microsatellites for 33 species. Although the higher mutation rate
at microsatellite loci might sometimes violate the assumption that mutation is negligible relative to migration [23],
no difference in FST due to the type of marker was detected
(results not shown).
An alternative measure of FST not affected by the
reduction of Ne due to inbreeding
In a neutral island model, FST/(1-FST) = 1/(4Ne.m) at equilibrium, where m is the migration rate among populations. Therefore, selfing is expected to increase FST for at
least two reasons: (i) selfing can reduce m by limiting pollen-mediated gene flow among populations (in strictly
selfing species, only seed dispersal contributes to the overall gene dispersal), and (ii) as a consequence of inbreeding, selfing should reduce Ne by a factor of 1/(1+FIS) [13].
Hence, when the within-population heterozygote deficit
FIS is positive, Ne = Ne'/(1+FIS), where Ne' is the expected
effective population size in the absence of inbreeding (Ne'
is the reciprocal of the probability that two gametes contributing to random separate adults come from the same
parent). To distinguish the two effects of selfing on genetic
structure, we define an alternative measure, FST' = FST/
[(1+FIS)(1-FST)], closely related to the parameter ρ [24].
Like ρ, FST' is not affected by the reduction of Ne due to
inbreeding because FST'/(1-FST') = 1/(4Ne'.m) in an island
model at equilibrium. Hence, under a neutral model, selfing will increase FST' only if it reduces m by limiting pollen-mediated gene flow.
Plant traits
For each species (additional file 1), information on the
following traits was gathered (either from the original
publications, by contacting directly the authors of the
original articles, in floras or by searching in specialised
web sites):

• Species stature, i.e. plant size, expressed in meters. We
expect a positive relationship between the stature of the
plant and the dispersal ability (through pollen and seeds).
• Species growth form, classified as woody or herbaceous.
Succulent species like Hedysarum carnosum and Melocactus
curvispinus, which are rare in our database, were grouped
with woody species.
• Species perenniality, corresponding to the distinction
between short-lived species (annual and biennial species)
and long-lived species (perennials). Note that growth
form and perenniality, although strongly correlated (all
woody plants are perennials), group different species,
since herbaceous plants can be either short-lived or longlived. Those species described in the literature as either

(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:177

short-lived or long-lived species (e.g. depending on the
environment) were classified as long-lived species.
• Species mode of pollen dispersal, coded as biotic (insects,
bats, birds) or abiotic (wind or water). Both biotic and
abiotic pollen dispersal were described for Cocos nucifera
and for Castanea sativa; they were grouped together with
species having abiotic mode of pollination.
The analysis of the relationship between genetic structure
(or mating system) and plant traits depends on the identification of the most relevant traits. In this respect, it
would have been preferable to include generation time
rather than some of its surrogates such as perenniality in
the analyses. Similarly, the assignment of mode of pollination into discrete categories (abiotic and biotic) can be
criticised as it is not always based on field observations
and ignores the potential for mixed dispersal factors [25].
However, such information is generally not available in
the literature.
Phylogenetic tree
A phylogenetic supertree (additional file 2) was built
using as backbone (up to the family level) the updated
version of the plant phylogenetic tree published by the
angiosperm phylogeny group [26]. The details of the
topology at lower taxonomic levels were then grafted
according to phylogenetic information obtained from various sources, generally from specific phylogenetic studies
at the family level or below [27-45]. Nevertheless some
phylogenetic relationships were left as soft polytomies
when it was not possible to resolve the topology due to
lack of published information. Given the different sources
of phylogenetic information it was not possible to determine branch lengths which were therefore set to 1, an
assumption that generally performs well for phylogenycontrolled comparative studies [46].
Statistical analyses
Transformation of the variables
Qualitative variables were coded as dummy: for growth
form, herbaceous = 0 and woody = 1; for perenniality,
short-lived = 0 and long-lived = 1; for mode of pollen dispersal, abiotic = 0 and biotic = 1. To improve normality of
the continuous variables (FST, FST', FIS, tm and stature) we
used the option "Box-Cox-Bartlett transformations"
included in the R Package for Multivariate and Spatial
Analysis Version 4.0 [47].
Transformation of the data into phylogenetically-independent
contrasts
To control for the phylogenetic relationships among species, data were transformed into phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs, [48]) using the PDAP module
[49] included in Mesquite software [50]. Phylogeny con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/177

trolled methods are statistically conservative and tend to
perform better in cross-species comparisons than nonphylogenetically controlled methods, even when their
assumptions are violated (like the non-Brownian mode of
evolution of the characters or inconsistencies of the chosen phylogenetic hypothesis) [51].
Regression analyses
Regression analyses were conducted under the following
assumptions, based on population genetics theory. (i) The
outcrossing rate (tm) can be influenced by plant traits. (ii)
Individual inbreeding within population (FIS) can be
influenced by plant traits and by tm. (iii) Genetic differentiation (FST and FST') can be influenced by plant traits, tm,
and FIS. Regressions analyses were performed on the raw
data (TIPs analyses: comparison of the values taken at the
tips of the tree) and on the independent contrasts using
SYSTAT, version 10.2.05 [52]. For PICs analyses, regressions were forced through the origin [48]. Multiple regression analyses were performed with the forward stepwise
regression option to integrate in the model the independent variables as a function of their importance (i.e. their
degree of relatedness with the dependent variable).

Species were considered mixed mating species when 0.1
<tm < 0.9 (number of species N = 129) or outcrossed species when tm > 0.9 (N = 129). Only five selfed species (tm
< 0.1) were present in the database, so no selfed category
was used.
Assessing biparental inbreeding and inbreeding depression
For the subset of non-outcrossed species for which both tm
and ts (ts is the mean of single locus outcrossing rate) were
available (80 species), we apply a sign test on the difference tm -ts to check for the presence of biparental inbreeding. A positive difference (tm >ts) will demonstrate the
presence of biparental inbreeding as ts should be more
affected by biparental inbreeding than the multi-locus
estimator tm (due to an over-estimation of the selfing rate
when polymorphism is low, [12]).

The expected inbreeding Fe would correspond to the fixation index (FIS) if selfing were the sole factor causing deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. For a mixed
mating model in the absence of inbreeding depression, Fe
is estimated as: Fe = (1-tm)/(1+tm) [16]. Differences in the
levels of inbreeding coefficient between seed and adult
cohorts would suggest that other factors than selfing influence genotypic frequencies [53]. High FIS estimates relative to the expectation could be caused by biparental
inbreeding, whereas low estimates could reflect the
impact of inbreeding depression. To test for statistical
trends in the distribution of Fe - FIS for all species and then
separately for each growth form by perenniality category
(short-lived herbaceous, long-lived herbaceous and

Page 4 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:177

woody species), we applied a sign test over all species
except outcrossed ones. Predominantly outcrossed species
were excluded from these analyses because the seeds produced are not inbred, so that inbreeding depression, even
if it exists, cannot manifest itself.
Under inbreeding depression (δ ≡ 1-wi/wo where wi and
wo are the fitness of inbred and outbred individuals,
respectively), the expected inbreeding is [53]:

FIS (δ , t ) =

(1−δ )(1− t )
1−δ + t + tδ

For each growth form by perenniality category, an average
value of δ was estimated by least square fitting of this
equation on the observed FIS and tm values. This approach
neglects inter-species variation but captures general trends
of the intensity of inbreeding depression according to
growth form and perenniality.

Results
Taxonomic coverage
The 263 species are distributed into 155 genera and 73
families; there are 63 gymnosperms genera (all conifers)
and 92 angiosperms genera (seven magnoliids, 22 monocots, 63 eudicots). Four botanical families are particularly
represented (families that contain more than 5% of the
species included in the database): Asteraceae, Fabaceae,
Myrtaceae (mainly the genus Eucalyptus) and Pinaceae;
together they include 47% of the species of the data set.
General patterns
The mean values of tm, FIS and FST as a function of growth
form, perenniality, a combination of perenniality/growth
form and pollination mode are provided in Figure 1 and
2 (and see additional file 3). The distribution of tm, FIS and
FST clearly depends on plant traits. This is particularly
remarkable for tm: long-lived woody species are generally
outcrossed, in contrast to short-lived herbaceous species,
for which the mating system ranges from fully selfing to
fully outcrossing. Values of FST, FIS and tm covary: when FST
decreases (for example FST is lower for woody species than
for herbaceous species), then FIS also decreases (woody
species present a lower inbreeding coefficient than herbaceous species) while tm increases (woody species are more
outcrossed than herbaceous species). Nevertheless most
of the statistically significant differences among categories
in TIPs analyses disappear when the phylogenetic signal is
controlled for (PICs analyses). The only relationships that
remain significant are those between growth form and FST,
between perenniality and FIS, and between growth form/
perenniality and tm.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/177

Relationships among traits
Stature, growth form and perenniality were found to be
positively associated using both TIPs and PICs analyses
(Figure 3). In contrast, TIPs but not PICs analyses identify
significant relationships between pollination mode and
the other traits, which are thus likely due to the phylogenetic conservatism of the studied traits.
Relationships between traits and FST (figure 1, table 1 and
additional file 4)
All four traits studied are strongly related with FST in TIPs
analyses (regression coefficient of FST as a function of stature is -0.45, P < 0.001). Herbaceous, short-lived, low-stature, biotically-pollinated, mixed-mating species present
higher levels of genetic structure than woody, long-lived,
high-stature, abiotically-pollinated, allogamous species.
The decomposition of herbaceous species into short-lived
and long-lived species demonstrates the impact of the perenniality within herbaceous species, as short-lived herbaceous species present higher FST than long-lived
herbaceous species (figure 1). When the phylogenetic signal is controlled for, FST depends on FIS, tm, growth form
and species stature (table 1). FST increases when FIS
increases and decreases when tm increases. FST is negatively
related to plant stature, and herbaceous species have
lower FST than woody species. The pollination mode has
no influence on FST (table 1). In long-lived species, FST is
also negatively associated with tm and positively with FIS
and with species stature, whereas long-lived woody species have lower FST than long-lived herbaceous species
(additional file 4). In a multiple regression framework
(PICs, table 1), variation in tm and FIS accounts for variation in FST but the growth form and the stature do not
enter into the model once tm and FIS are included. Additional file 4 indicates that for herbaceous and woody species the main influencing factor is FIS (the effect of tm
disappears in the multiple regression).
Relationships between traits and FST' (table 1 and
additional file 4)
As for FST, FST' depends on FIS, tm, stature and growth form
(table 1). The strength of the relationship between FST'
and tm and between FST' and FIS is lower than the respective relationships with FST. Contrarily to FST, in a multiple
regression with stepwise selection, tm is the main explanatory variable of FST' and FIS does not enter the model once
tm is accounted for. The comparison between FST and FST'
is particularly interesting when focusing on species from
different categories (long-lived, herbaceous, woody, additional file 4). In long-lived species, FST' is no longer associated with FIS. By contrast FST' is still related with FIS in
herbaceous species, although tm remains the main explanatory variable.

Relationships between traits and FIS (figure 1, tables 1 and
2)
All traits are correlated with the inbreeding coefficient
FISin TIPs analyses (figure 1; regression coefficient FIS as a
function of stature is -0.27, P < 0.001). Herbaceous, shortlived, low-stature, biotically-pollinated, mixed-mating
species present higher inbreeding coefficient than, respectively, woody, long-lived, high-stature, abiotically-pollinated, allogamous species. Moreover, short-lived
herbaceous species present higher FIS than long-lived herbaceous species (figure 1). Based on PICs analyses, the
inbreeding coefficient depends mainly on the outcrossing
rate, with outcrossed species displaying lower inbreeding

(table 1). But perenniality also remains a statistically significant predictive factor of the level of FIS, with perennial
species characterised by lower inbreeding. By contrast,
there is no residual relationship between the size of the
plants and FIS. The outcrossing rate tm is negatively associated with FIS for all categories of plants (long-lived, herbaceous and woody species, table 2). In addition, for
herbaceous species, there is an effect of perenniality, but it
does not persist when tm is accounted for (table 2).

Relationships between traits and outcrossing rate tm
(figure 1, table 1 and 3 and additional file 5)
The outcrossing rate is positively associated with all four
traits studied, although less strongly with pollination
mode (figure 1; regression coefficient of tm as a function of
stature is 0.44, P < 0.001, in TIPs analyses). Woody, longlived, high-stature, abiotically-pollinated species have
higher outcrossing rates than herbaceous, short-lived,
low-stature, biotically-pollinated species. The associations
of tm with growth form and perenniality persist in PICs
analyses, but not that with pollination mode, indicating
that previously identified relationships between mating
system and pollination mode might be due to pseudoreplication [22] (table 3). Additionally, taller species have
higher outcrossing rates (table 1), but not if we restrict the
analyses to woody plants (table 3). Based on multiple
regression analyses, the strongest relationship was found
between mating system and perenniality: annual or biannual species present lower outcrossing rates than perennial species (table 1). Once this variable is taken into
account, growth form is still an explanatory variable of tm
despite the fact that most herbaceous species are shortlived species and that all woody species are long-lived species. The additional information stems probably from the
difference between herbaceous and woody perennials. To

summarize, as already mentioned by [20], average tm
increases in the following sequence: short-lived herbaceous species, long-lived herbaceous species, woody species (figure 1).
Presence of biparental inbreeding
A positive signal of biparental inbreeding over all species
is revealed by the sign test applied on the difference tm- ts
(124 cases with tm> ts, versus only 33 with tm< ts, P <
0.001). Few informative data are available for short-lived
herbaceous species, making it difficult to test for a trend
(only five cases, all with tm> ts, P = 0.063). For perennial
species the trend is significant (for herbaceous species: 16
cases versus two with tm> ts, P = 0.001 and for woody species: 45 versus 10 with tm> ts, P < 0.001). Differences in
levels of biparental inbreeding among categories are not
significant (data not shown).
Difference between observed and predicted inbreeding
coefficient
Figure 4 illustrates the observed inbreeding compared to
that expected at equilibrium if selfing was the sole cause
of inbreeding (Fe = [1-tm]/[1+tm]). There is a global trend
towards FIS< Fe over all species, which indicates a selection
against inbred individuals (94 cases, compared to 48 with

Figure 4
Distribution of FIS according to tm
Distribution of FIS according to tm. The open circles correspond to short-lived herbaceous species, the closed circles to
long-lived herbaceous species and the crosses to woody species. The thick continuous line represents Fe, which is the expected
FIS based on the observed tm, assuming a mixed-mating system at equilibrium without inbreeding depression. The other lines
correspond to the best-fitting curves according to equation 1 after adjusting the level of inbreeding depression, δ, for shortlived herbaceous species (short-hatched line), perennial herbaceous species (long-hatched line) and woody species (continuous
line).

FIS> Fe, P < 0.001). In short-lived herbaceous species, FIS is
very close to Fe, whereas for perennial species a majority
of species have FIS <Fe, especially when 0.1 <tm < 0.9 (i.e.
in mixed-mating species). There was no significant difference between FIS and Fe in short-lived species (16 cases
with FIS< Fe, compared to 10 with FIS> Fe, P = 0.33), in
contrast to herbaceous perennial species that present a
marginally significant trend (23 cases with FIS < Fe, compared to 11 with FIS> Fe, P = 0.057) and woody species
that present a significant trend (55 cases with FIS< Fe, compared to 27 with FIS> Fe, P = 0.003). However, the mean
of FIS- Fe does not differ significantly between short-lived
(M = -0.04, N = 26) and long-lived species (M = -0.08, N
= 116) (P = 0.30).
Estimation of inbreeding depression

The measures of inbreeding depression δ obtained by
least square fitting of the data using the equation
(1−δ )(1− t )

FIS (δ , t ) = 1−δ + t + tδ [53] are 0.24 for short-lived herbaceous, 0.53 for long-lived herbaceous and 0.66 for woody
species. These values are probably somewhat underesti-

mated, given that biparental inbreeding exists in all plant
categories; its effect should be to inflate FIS compared to
the equilibrium expectation (Fe) based on selfing rate.

Discussion
Using for the first time quantitative estimates of outcrossing rate (tm), we confirm previous studies showing that
mating system largely controls plant population genetic
structure [2,4,6,54]. Our results, which rely on the use of
independent contrasts, also show that once mating system
and inbreeding are accounted for, plant traits are no
longer associated with FST [6]. We further show that mating system affects FST via its effect on pollen-mediated
gene flow and on effective population size (i.e. drift).
These two mechanisms have long been known to affect
FST [55] but it has generally not been possible to tell them
apart. We were able to partially disentangle their effects by
comparing traditional FST with an alternative parameter
(FST') that controls for the influence of inbreeding on
effective population size but is not affected by the impact
of the mating system on inbreeding. Under a neutral
model, the negative correlation of FST' with tm indicates

Page 10 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:177

that selfing reduces pollen-mediated gene flow among
populations. Hence, selfing results not only in increased
genetic drift due to inbreeding but also in decreased pollen-mediated gene flow, as discussed by Ingvarsson [56].
However, FST' is not significantly correlated with tm when
the analysis is restricted to long-lived species or to woody
species, probably because most species are then predominantly outcrossed and a reduction of pollen flow due to
selfing becomes hardly perceptible.
Selfing can also reduce Ne by other processes than
inbreeding, for instance through selective sweeps and
hitchhiking, as a consequence of background selection, or
because it magnifies the consequences of extinction and
recolonisation [56,57]. This could explain the remaining
association between FST' and FIS. Indeed, controlling for
the inbreeding effect of selfing did not fully account for
the actual reduction of Ne caused by selfing. Munoz et al.
(Munoz F, Violle C, Cheptou P-O: Plant mating system is
related to CSR strategy: from selfing ruderals to outcrossing competitors. Unpublished) demonstrated that selfing
species are mainly early-successional species, suggesting
that metapopulation dynamics could differ depending on
the mating system.
Despite the strong impact of the mating system on FST, FIS
rather than tm is the main explanatory variable of FST, as
already apparent in our previous study [6]. However, this
difference is not significant, since identical results were
obtained in partial regression analyses regardless of which
factor, tm or FIS, is first included in the model (data not
shown). The important point here is that both tm and FIS
explain the FST, showing that they contain complementary
information. The outcrossing rate tm is expected to be an
accurate predictor of species inbreeding history only if
outcrossing rate is stable over time, which is generally not
the case. By contrast FIS reflects inbreeding not only in the
current generation but also in previous generations [58].
Furthermore, FIS integrates other sources of inbreeding
besides that caused by selfing, such as intra-population
genetic structuring (Wahlund effect, [59]) resulting in
biparental inbreeding and/or selection against inbreds
(inbreeding depression).
Although plant traits are not directly associated with FST,
they could still control it indirectly, via their effect on mating system and on inbreeding. This had not been tested in
previous studies because accurate quantifications of mating system were missing. Here we show that there is a
strong association between mating system and perenniality: in contrast to short-lived plants, most long-lived
plants are outcrossed. Growth form also appears to play a
role on mating system, because woody plants (which are
all long-lived) are more outcrossed than perennial herbaceous plants. Interestingly, plant stature does not influ-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/177

ence outcrossing rate once perenniality and growth form
are controlled for. Finally, we did not find any association
between mating system and mode of pollination, in contrast to previous studies that did not use phylogenetic corrections [20,22,60]. Overall, the main predictor of
outcrossing rate is perenniality, suggesting that there is a
repeated pattern in unrelated lineages of evolutionary
change towards selfing driven by short life cycles (or reciprocally an evolutionary transition towards outcrossing
driven by longer life cycles). This result points to selective
forces driving the evolution of plant mating systems [61].
Perenniality is related not only with mating system but
also with inbreeding. Long-lived species, which are more
outcrossed than short-lived species, have lower inbreeding coefficients. Interestingly, perenniality still influences
the level of inbreeding FIS once mating system has been
controlled for (i.e. a perennial species having the same
outcrossing rate than an annual species tends to have less
inbreeding). This might be explained by a difference
between short-lived and long-lived species in their level of
biparental inbreeding and/or of inbreeding depression.
The first possibility implies that short-lived species are
more subject to biparental inbreeding than long-lived
ones, for instance due to reduced gene flow. Our data do
not provide support for this hypothesis, as biparental
inbreeding appears to be a general phenomenon in plant
species. The second possibility implies that selection
against inbreds is stronger in perennials than in non-perennials [17-19]. Our data confirm the trend of increased
inbreeding depression from short-lived herbaceous to
long-lived herbaceous and to woody species. Hence, FIS
integrates information not only on selfing but also on
selection against inbreds, which is associated with perenniality. This could explain why perenniality remains a significant explanatory variable of FIS once the outcrossing
rate is accounted for (table 1). Similarly, inbreeding
depression might explain why FIS remains a significant
explanatory variable of FST once the outcrossing rate is
accounted for (table 1).
Two opposite scenarios can be proposed to explain the
negative relationship between inbreeding depression and
FST. Selection against inbreds could lower FST by reducing
the effective selfing rate and hence intra-population drift.
Alternatively, genetic structure could affect inbreeding
depression. A plant in a given population will receive pollen either (i) from a pollen donor from another population (external-outbred pollen, Peo), (ii) from a pollen
donor from the same population (local-outbred pollen,
Pio), or (iii) from its own pollen (self-pollen, Ps). Assuming that there is no outbreeding depression, the offspring
fitness should vary according to the pollen source, as follows: Weo > Wio > Ws. When FST is low, one can expect Wio
to be close to Weo because external and local pollen will be

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:177

genetically similar. When FST is large, one can expect Wio
to be close to Ws because individuals are strongly related
and the population will have already been purged from
partially recessive deleterious alleles. This would result in
lower inbreeding depression δ in short-lived, high-FST species.
The high outcrossing rate found in woody perennial is
likely a strategy to avoid the deleterious effects of inbreeding. The reason why woody perennials are particularly
sensitive to inbreeding remains elusive. There are two
main hypotheses, one stating that deleterious effects
become magnified through time, due to their multiplicative effects on fitness [18], and the other that deleterious
effects depend on the number of cell divisions per cycle
[17]. As cell divisions accumulate through time, the two
hypotheses are difficult to distinguish. Moreover, stature
is certainly a poor surrogate for the number of cell divisions [17], whereas perenniality is a poor surrogate for
generation time. Nevertheless, our results do suggest that
the association between stature and mating system could
be a by-product of the correlation of stature with perenniality and growth form. This is illustrated by the absence of
association between stature and tm among herbaceous
species and among woody species.

Conclusion
Despite imprecision associated with the measures of FST,
FIS and tm, our study has revealed general macroevolutionary patterns emerging from the phylogenetically-controlled correlation structure of these measures with species
traits. We confirm that mating system is the main determinant of FST, whereas its impact on FST' suggests that some
degree of selfing eventually reduces pollen-mediated gene
flow. The effect of selective processes associated with selfing can not be fully disentangled but could also play a
role. Selfing and mating between relatives also affect FST
by increasing inbreeding, which enhances genetic drift.
However, other processes can affect inbreeding, in particular inbreeding depression: long-lived species present
higher inbreeding depression than short-lived species.
Perenniality, and, to a lesser extent, woodiness (which are
both surrogates of generation time) appear to have a
major influence on plant mating system and inbreeding
and hence indirectly on plant genetic structure. These
results, together with previous ones showing that generation time affects the rate of molecular evolution [62,63],
point to the complex inter-relation between life history
traits and plant evolution.
