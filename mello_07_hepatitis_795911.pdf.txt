Abstract
Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) isolates have been classified in eight genotypes, A to H,
which exhibit distinct geographical distributions. Genotypes A, D and F are predominant in Brazil,
a country formed by a miscegenated population, where the proportion of individuals from
Caucasian, Amerindian and African origins varies by region. Genotype F, which is the most
divergent, is considered indigenous to the Americas. A systematic molecular characterization of
HBV isolates from different parts of the world would be invaluable in establishing HBV evolutionary
origins and dispersion patterns. A large-scale study is needed to map the region-by-region
distribution of the HBV genotypes in Brazil.
Results: Genotyping by PCR-RFLP of 303 HBV isolates from HBsAg-positive blood donors
showed that at least two of the three genotypes, A, D, and F, co-circulate in each of the five
geographic regions of Brazil. No other genotypes were identified. Overall, genotype A was most
prevalent (48.5%), and most of these isolates were classified as subgenotype A1 (138/153; 90.2%).
Genotype D was the most common genotype in the South (84.2%) and Central (47.6%) regions.
The prevalence of genotype F was low (13%) countrywide. Nucleotide sequencing of the S gene
and a phylogenetic analysis of 32 HBV genotype F isolates showed that a great majority (28/32;
87.5%) belonged to subgenotype F2, cluster II. The deduced serotype of 31 of 32 F isolates was
adw4. The remaining isolate showed a leucine-to-isoleucine substitution at position 127.
Conclusion: The presence of genotypes A, D and F, and the absence of other genotypes in a large
cohort of HBV infected individuals may reflect the ethnic origins of the Brazilian population. The

high prevalence of isolates from subgenotype A1 (of African origin) indicates that the African influx
during the colonial slavery period had a major impact on the circulation of HBV genotype A
currently found in Brazil. Although most genotype F isolates belonged to cluster II, the presence of
some isolates belonging to clusters I (subgroup Ib) and IV suggests the existence of two or more
founder viral populations of genotype F in Brazil.

Background
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the prototype of the Hepadnaviridae family characterized by DNA viruses with tropism
to hepatic cells. HBV is an etiologic agent of human liver
diseases, including acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis,
and hepatocellular carcinoma. As such, it constitutes a significant public health problem, estimated to chronically
infect more than 350 million people worldwide (reviewed
in [1]).
The HBV genome is a partially double-stranded circular
DNA molecule approximately 3.2 kb in length. The viral
proteins are encoded by four partially overlapping open
reading frames (ORFs), which allow the virus to produce
50% more proteins than would be predicted by the small
genome size. HBVs also have an unusual replication strategy. Because they first synthesize RNA intermediates from
which DNA is synthesized by reverse transcription, the
HBV DNA viruses have substitution rates more than 10fold higher than other DNA viruses.
On the basis of genetic differences, HBV have been classified into eight genomic groups (A-H). Entire genome
sequences within each group diverge from other groups
by more than 8%. These eight groups have distinct geographical distributions [2,3]. Genotype A is distributed
globally and is the main genotype found in Europe, North
America, Africa and India. Genotypes B and C are predominant in East and Southeast Asia, and Australia. Genotype D is mainly found in the Middle East and
Mediterranean countries but has been reported globally,
whereas genotype E seems to be predominant in West
Africa. Genotype G has been characterized in samples
from USA, Mexico and France, and genotypes F and H are
found exclusively in Central and South America (reviewed
in [4,5]).
Some genotypes have been further subdivided into subgroups (subgenotypes) with distinct geographic origins.
The HBV genotype A strain is now divided into three
genetic clusters. Subgenotype A1 represents isolates with
an African-Asian origin, whereas subgenotype A2 includes
isolates with European-North American origin [6].
Recently, a new subgenotype, designated A3, was
described in Cameroon [7]. Genotypes B [3,8-10], and C
[3,11,12] have each been subdivided into four subgenotypes, and genotype D [3,13,14] has been subdivided into

five subgenotypes. Genotype F, which constitutes the
most divergent group [15], is indigenous to the Americas
and is the major circulating genotype in Argentina [1618], Venezuela [19,20], the Peruvian Amazon Basin [21],
Northern Brazil [22] and Central American countries,
including Costa Rica, El Salvador and Nicaragua [23].
Recently, two subgenotypes, F1 and F2, have been proposed for this genotype, each characterized by a specific
amino acid residue, Leu45 and Thr45, respectively, in the
small (S) gene product [24]. A subdivision of isolates
from genotype F into five clusters (Ia, Ib, II, III and IV) has
also been proposed by Mbayed et al. on the basis of comparisons between S gene sequences [25]. Clusters Ia and
Ib, associated with subgenotype F1, are representative of
strains found mainly in Central America and Argentina,
respectively. Subgenotype F2 includes clusters II (Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Brazil), III (Panama, Venezuela, and
Colombia) and IV (Argentina and Bolivia) (reviewed in
[4]).
Brazil is a federation of 26 states and one federal district
occupying approximately 8,500,000 km2 divided broadly
into five geographic regions: North, Northeast, CentralWest, Southeast and South. Early studies have shown variability in HBV prevalence in different Brazilian regions.
The Amazon basin, corresponding to the North region
and the northern portions of the Central-West region, is
characterized by a rate of endemic HBV infection, in contrast to the low prevalence found in southern regions of
the country [22,26-28]. Brazil, a country with a highly
miscegenated population, exhibits an HBV genotype circulation pattern that is distinct from the distribution
found in other Latin American countries, with genotypes
A, D and F being the most prevalent among HBV carriers
[29-31].
In this study, we performed a molecular characterization
of HBV strains derived from HBsAg-positive blood donors
living in different Brazilian regions. S region nucleotide
sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed to
determine the relationships between HBV genotype F isolates from Brazil and from other American countries.

types A, D and F were present at different frequencies; no
other genotypes were identified in the samples analyzed.
Genotype A was the most prevalent in the North (52/82;
63.4%), Northeast (13/24; 54.2%) and Southeast (36/56;
64.3%) regions. Genotype D was the most prevalent in
South (32/38; 84.2%), whereas genotype F isolates were
absent in this region (Figure 1). In the center of the country, represented by the Central-West region, there was a
balanced distribution of genotypes A (46/103; 44.7%)
and D (49/103; 47.6%). Countrywide, genotype A was the
most common (48.5%), followed by genotype D (38.5%)
and genotype F (13%).
As shown in a previous work [31], the PCR-RFLP genotyping method divided each genotype in different RFLP patterns. In the current study, a total of thirteen RFLP patterns
were observed (Table 1). Genotype A isolates were subdivided into four patterns, AI-AIV, the great majority of
which were classified as AI or AII (138/153; 90.2%).
Among the five RFLP patterns found for genotype D (DIDV), patterns DI and DII were the most prevalent (92/
116; 79.3%). For genotype F, FI was the most frequent
pattern (20/34; 58.8%) of the four patterns found (FI-FIII,
FV).

Phylogenetic analysis of the small (S) gene and amino acid
replacements
The results of PCR-FRLP analysis were confirmed by direct
nucleotide sequencing of HBV S gene PCR products from
62 of 303 samples (20.5%), including randomly selected
samples from genotype A (22 samples) and genotype D
(13 samples), and 27 samples from genotype F. No discrepancies were found between the two methods. Among
genotype A samples, 15/22 (68.2%) were classified as
subgenotype A1 and 7/22 (31.8%) as subgenotype A2. A
phylogenetic analysis of genotype D samples assigned 10/
13 (76.9%) to subgenotype D3 and 3/13 (23.1%) to subgenotype D2. The deduced amino acid sequence of the S
gene product and an analysis of antigenic determinant a
residues 122 and 127 confirmed the expected serotype
pattern of all but one genotyped sample. All 22 HBV genotype A samples were classified as serotype adw2. Nine
genotype D samples were classified as serotypes ayw2 and
three were identified as ayw3. Of the 32 HBV genotype F
samples, 31 were adw4, and one, 052-N, had an unusual
substitution of isoleucine for leucine at residue 127. Three
HBV genotype A isolates (358-S; 312-SE; 161-CW) were
shown to harbor tyrosine to cysteine substitutions in
determinant a residue 100 (Y100C), and the T118VA128V double mutant was found in three genotype D isolates (Table 2). The partial amino acid sequence of HBV
polymerase showed amino acid substitutions related to
the lamivudine-resistance phenotype in two isolates
derived from this group of HBsAg positive blood donors.
One (209-CW) displayed the double rtL180M-rtM204V
lamivudine-resistance mutation and the other (043-N)
showed an additional rtV173L mutation, which is also
associated with lamivudine resistance [32] (Table 2).
Molecular characterization of genotype F isolates
A phylogenetic analysis of the S gene sequences from 32
HBV genotype F isolates (27 from blood donors and 5
previously characterized serum samples from the native
Amerindian Apurinã tribe) in a set with 27 international
HBV genotype F sequences (GenBank), classified genotype F isolates into five different subgroups (Figure 2).
Using the topology of the phylogenetic tree, we were able
to identify the subgenotypes F1 and F2 (Figure 2). The vast
majority of Brazilian genotype F strains determined in the
present study (28/32; 93.75%) were classified as subgenotype F2, whereas only two samples (2/32; 6.25%) were
grouped into subgenotype F1. An amino acid analysis
supported this finding, showing that all samples grouped
into the F2 subgenotype by the phylogenetic analysis contained a threonine at position 45 of the S gene product,
whereas the two subgenotype F1 samples had a leucine at
this position (data not shown). The tree topology also
allowed us to identify the five genotype F clusters (Figure
2). Twenty-eight of 32 samples analyzed (87.5%) were
classified into cluster II and 2 samples (6.25%) were

assigned to cluster IV; the two subgenotype F1 samples
were related to cluster Ib. Correlating the RFLP patterns
and the phylogenetic clusters of isolates belonging to genotype F for all Brazilian samples, we found that samples
characterized as RFLP pattern FI were grouped in cluster II,
whereas those classified as FII and FIII on the basis of
RFLP patterns were related to isolates from cluster IV and
Ib, respectively.

Discussion
The previously described co-circulation of HBV genotypes
A, D and F in Brazil [31,33-39] was confirmed in the
present study, which also found that no other HBV genotypes were present in a sample of 303 blood donors. The
identification of genotype prevalence patterns in Brazil
that are distinct from worldwide geographic distribution
patterns could be a reflection of the intensely migratory
and highly miscegenated character of the Brazilian population. Genotypes B and C, previously identified in a few
Brazilian individuals, all of Asian origin [36,40], have not
been detected in the present study. The absence of genotypes B and C may be explained by a combination of a
limited sample size and an unbalanced distribution of
individuals from Asian origin throughout the Brazilian

territory (reflecting the tendency of Asian immigrants to
concentrate in certain restricted geographic areas).
The distribution of HBV genotypes A and D in Brazil
seemed to follow a gradient from northern to southern
regions (Figure 1). North, Northeast and Southeast
regions showed a higher prevalence of genotype A, the
most common genotype in Brazil. The high rate of genotype D isolates in the South region could be related to the
influx of immigrants from Central Europe (especially Germany and Italy) that occurred in that region at the beginning of the 20th century. The balanced distribution of
genotypes A and D in the Central-West region could be
explained by the delayed occupation of that area by population migration flows from South, Southeast and
Northeast regions.
HBV genotype A had been initially divided into two
genetic subgroups, A1 and A2, on the basis of sequence
divergence [6,7]. A previously described PCR-RFLP genotyping method has classified HBV isolates into more than
20 patterns [31]. Sequences showing patterns AI, AII and
AVI clustered in subgroup A1, whereas those showing patterns AIII and AV were found exclusively in subgroup A2.

Phylogenetic-tree representing HBV genotype F isolates. Brazilian sequences determined in this study are represented in bold (•), designated by the corresponding region
of the sample (N: North region; NE: Northeast region; CW:
Central-West region; SE: Southeast region) with RFLP pattern in brackets. International sequences are designated with
their accession number followed by their countries of origin.

In the present study, the RFLP and sequence analyses of
genotype A isolates circulating in Brazil showed a high
prevalence of isolates from subgroup A1 (90.2%, Table 1),
corroborating previous results and indicating that the
HBV genotype A circulating in Latin America is not exclusively associated with the European influx, as once
thought (reviewed in [4]). On the contrary, the massive
African forced migration during the colonial times (from
the 16th to 19th century) was a major contributor to the
HBV circulation currently found in Brazil. The absence of
genotype E, which circulates in sub-Saharan Africa where
substantial slave traffic occurred, could be explained by
the relatively recent emergence of this genotype as a
human pathogen, dating from the mid to late 19th century
[41] when the slave trade had already been abolished.
A large-scale study on the geographic distribution of
HBsAg subtypes in Brazil, published in the late 1980s,
reported a high incidence of adw2 (associated with genotype A) in all regions, except the South region, where subtypes ayw2 and ayw3 (both associated with genotype D)
were the most prevalent [22]. These results are in accord
with our current results. However, other findings of this
previous study, including the reported absence of subtypes other than adw2 in Northeast region, a vast majority
of the adw2 subtype in the Central-West region, and the
high prevalence of subtype adw4 (genotype F) in the
North region, are not corroborated by our study. These
discrepancies may be explained by differences in methodology: Because the former study classified HBV isolates on
the basis of differences in antigenic determinants [22],
which usually requires high titers of HBsAg for subtype
determination, it may have mischaracterized low titer
samples that are readily classified using genotypic analyses. Alternatively, divergent conclusions could arise due to
differences in sampling that affect the population under
study and lead to a genotype prevalence bias with an
underestimation of genotype F. For example, the current
study analyzed serum samples from blood banks located
in state capitals of Brazil, a sampling strategy that would
tend to under-represent certain groups, such as Amerindians, that are not often voluntary blood donors. It is also
possible that a given genotype induces more symptomatic
infection, leading to a reduction in its prevalence in the
potential blood donor population. Further studies comparing clinical outcomes in patients infected with genotypes A, D and F will be required to address this question.
In general, HBV genotype F, which is native to the Amerindians, showed a low prevalence in Brazil (13%). This
was true even in the North region where the native Amerindian population comprises a larger fraction of the total
population. This result supports the findings of Moraes et
al. [33] and contrasts with the high prevalence of genotype
F described in other South American countries, including

BMC Microbiology 2007, 7:103

Venezuela [19,20] and Argentina [16,18]. These data indicate that, in Brazil, the native Amerindian population has
made a minor contribution to the population as a whole,
a fact supported by an analysis of mitochondrial DNA
[42,43].
As a starting point for establishing a molecular characterization of Brazilian HBV genotype F isolates, we determined S gene sequences. When combined with a
phylogenetic analysis, nucleotide sequences of individual
genes, in particular the S gene, can reveal relationships
that help to elucidate the molecular epidemiology of HBV
[4,25,44,45]. The topology of the HBV genotype F phylogenetic tree showed that the great majority of Brazilian
strains characterized in the present study could be classified as subgenotype F2, cluster II. Two previous studies
have described one Brazilian sequence belonging to cluster II [17,25]. In the present study, HBV genotype F isolates with sequences closely related to those grouped in
clusters IV and Ib were found, suggesting that Brazilian
genotype F strains may not be derived from one another.
Assuming that the five samples previously characterized as
genotype F from the Apurinã tribe (apurina_01–05) represent the native original HBV of the Brazilian Indians,
and further assuming that the great majority of Brazilian
genotype F sequences determined in this study was closely
related to them, it is reasonable to infer that HBV genotype F circulating in Brazil is mainly derived from the
native aboriginal populations. However, the differences
observed between the two sequences grouped in cluster Ib
(232-NE; 221-NE) and the other genotype F sequences
could indicate that two or three viral populations with distinct origin circulate in Brazil. Moreover, the existence of
this well-defined cluster as the representative Brazilian
isolate would indicate that HBV genotype F arose from a
common ancestor, but evolved separately after becoming
isolated in different regions of the Americas.
Genotyping using PCR-RFLP analysis and nucleotide
sequencing gave the same result for all 62 samples tested,
indicating that our PCR-RFLP genotyping method is
appropriate for large-scale studies. Similar to our previous
report on genotype A isolates [31], our results here demonstrate an interesting correlation between the RFLP patterns identified and the cluster analysis of HBV genotype
F isolates. All FI RFLP-pattern isolates subjected to nucleotide sequencing were found to group into genotype F
cluster II, whereas the two isolates grouped in cluster IV
(326-SE; 179-CW) and the two isolates grouped in cluster
Ib (232-NE; 221-NE) were classified as RFLP pattern FII
and FIII, respectively. Although more extensive sampling
will be necessary to confirm this relationship, it is possible
that RFLP patterns could be used to establish to which
cluster the HBV genotype F isolate is related.

The identification of a novel isoleucine substitution at residue 127 in one HBV genotype F isolate (052-N) classified
by serotype using amino acid analysis reinforces the need
for further investigation of genotype F strains. The
deduced amino acid sequence of the S gene product also
revealed three isolates bearing the determinant a substitution Y100C, which is associated with the HBsAg-negative/
anti-HBc-positive phenotype in blood donors from Venezuela [46] and has been found in an HBsAg-positive Brazilian patient [47]. Further studies will be required to
determine whether this mutation is truly related to a
reduction in HBsAg detection. The T118V-A128V double
mutation was found in three genotype D/ayw3 (subgenotype D2) isolates. These substitutions, which have been
found in other subgenotype D2 isolates [3], have recently
been identified in Brazil (unpublished data), Spain, Sweden and Poland [48].
The deduced amino acid sequence of HBV polymerase
showed that two isolates had substitutions in residues
associated with lamivudine resistance. The frequent lamivudine-resistance rtL180M-rtM204V double mutation
was detected in two isolates (043-N and 209-CW), while
a third isolate (043-N) displayed a rare rtV173L-rtL180MrtM204V triple mutation (Table 2). This triple mutant is
known to exhibit reduced in vitro affinity for anti-HBs
antibodies, similar to the hepatitis B vaccine escape
mutant G145R [32,49]. These findings were unexpected
given that the samples analyzed in the present study were
derived from blood donors, a group of individuals not
undergoing lamivudine therapy. However, lamivudineresistant isolates would eventually be expected to circulate
in the environment as a result of contact with chronic hepatitis B patients undergoing lamivudine antiviral therapy,
allowing healthy individuals, including blood donors, to
become exposed to a primary infection with an HBV
mutant strain. The presence of lamivudine-resistant isolates could also be related to previously reports of HBV
isolates with a YMDD motif mutation in chronic hepatitis
B patients not treated with lamivudine [50,51].
The evolutionary origins of HBV remain ill defined.
Although some early studies have suggested a New World
origin for this virus, the data are ambiguous and specific
inferences should be drawn with caution [52,53]. The
diversification of HBV genotypes is poorly understood,
but estimates based on phylogenetic divergence rates have
calculated that HBV genotypes diverged less than 6000
years ago (reviewed in [54]). The origin of genotype F is
particularly obscure, and may represent the first split from
the human hepadnaviral ancestor (reviewed in [12]). As
many authors have noted, a refined analysis of the evolutionary history of HBV will require more extensive sampling of HBV genomes.

Conclusion
The distribution of HBV genotypes A and D identified in
the present study followed an apparent gradient from
northern to southern regions of Brazil, possibly reflecting
the influence of early populations and settlement patterns
during the process of occupying the country. The high
prevalence of isolates from subgroup A1 (90.2%) may
denote a major contribution of forced African influx during the colonial slavery period to the current HBV genotype A circulation in Brazil.
In contrast to other Latin American countries, HBV genotype F showed a low prevalence in Brazil (13%), even in
the North region where the native aboriginal population
has a greater influence. The topology of the phylogenetic
tree for HBV genotype F strains allowed the classification
of most strains into subgenotype F2 within cluster II. The
existence of this well-defined cluster as the representative
Brazilian isolate would indicate that HBV genotype F
arose from a common ancestor, but evolved separately
after becoming isolated in different regions of the Americas. The presence of some isolates of clusters IV and I (subgroup Ib) argues for the existence of two or more founder
viral populations of genotype F in Brazil. Because the
diversification of HBV genotypes remains poorly understood, particularly that of genotype F, more extensive sampling of HBV genomes would be helpful in unraveling the
complex evolutionary history of HBV.

primer (C1, 5'-CTGTGGAGTTACTCTCGTTTTTGC-3', nt
positions 1935–1958) and two antisense primers (S2, 5'GGGTTTAAATGTATACCCAAAGA-3', 819–841, and S22,
5'-GTATTTAAATGGATACCCACAGA-3',
819–841)
located at the same position on the genome to facilitate
the amplification of all HBV genotypes [33]. After an initial denaturation step (3 min at 94°C), DNA was amplified using 35 cycles of 94°C for 40 s, 55°C for 1 min, and
72°C for 2 min 30 s, followed by a final elongation step
(7 min at 72°C). The first round of amplification was performed with 1 μL of DNA and one unit of Taq DNA
polymerase (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) in a final volume
of 25 μL. The second round of amplification was performed in a final volume of 50 μL, using 1 μL of the first
round PCR product, sense primer PS1 (5'-CCATATTCTTGGGAACAAGA-3', 2826–2845) and antisense primers S2
and S22, under the following conditions: 30 cycles of
95°C for 30 s, 52°C for 40 s, and 72°C for 2 min, followed by a final elongation step (7 min at 72°C). Ten
microliters of amplification product (about 1,200 bp in
length) was loaded on 1% agarose gels, electrophoresed,
stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV
light. Genotyping by RFLP analysis was performed as previously described [31] using 10 μL of PCR products
digested separately with two units of BamHI, EcoRI and
StuI restriction endonucleases (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) at 37°C for 2 h. Digestion products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 2%
agarose gel.

Methods
Serum samples
A total of 303 serum samples from HBsAg-positive blood
donors were collected between 2003 and 2004 at blood
banks located in state capitals cities of Brazil representing
different Brazilian regions. Thirty-eight samples were
from the Santa Catarina State (South region); 56 samples
were from Rio de Janeiro State (Southeastern region); 103
samples were from the three states that compose CentralWest region: Goiás (18), Mato Grosso (55), and Mato
Grosso do Sul (30); 24 samples were from Pernambuco
State (Northeast region); and 82 samples were from the
North region (35 from Pará, 34 from Amazonas, and 13
from Amapá). In addition, five HBsAg-positive serum
samples from the native Amerindian tribe Apurinã (Amazonas, Brazil), previously characterized as genotype F by
PCR-RFLP, were included in the study.
DNA extraction, amplification and RFLP analysis
HBV DNA was phenol/chloroform extracted from 250 μL
of serum after treatment with 0.5 mg/mL of proteinase K
for 4 h at 37°C in the presence of 0.2 M NaCl and 0.25%
SDS, as previously described [55]. After precipitation with
ethanol, the pellet was dried and resuspended in 30 μL of
distilled water. The pre-S/S genome region was amplified
by semi-nested PCR. The first round contained one sense

Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
The HBV S gene from 62 RFLP-genotyped samples was
sequenced to verify the accuracy of our RFLP-based genotyping method. Twenty-two samples characterized as genotype A and 13 samples as genotype D by the RFLP-based
method were randomly chosen for nucleotide sequencing. Twenty-seven samples determined as genotype F and
5 samples from native Amerindian tribe Apurinã (Amazonas, Brazil) previously characterized as genotype F were
also sequenced. The S gene was first amplified by PCR
using a mixture of one sense primer (S1, 5'-CTTCTCGAGGACTGGGGACC-3', nt positions 124–143) and two antisense primers (S2, S22, described above) followed by
purification of PCR products using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). Purified PCR products
were prepared for sequencing using a Big Dye Terminator
3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA) with external primers S1 and S2 or S22, internal
sense primer S4 (5'-TGCTGCTATGCCTCATCTTCT-3', nt
416–436) and antisense S7 (5'-TGAGCCAGGAGAAACGGGCT-3', nt 676–656). The sequence was determined by
separation and analysis of extension products using an
automated ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA).

Raw HBV S gene sequence data were processed using programs from the Genetic Computer Group (GCG) package
(University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). Phylogenetic
analysis was performed by comparing 681 bp sequences
from the HBV S gene determined in this study with HBV
sequences available at GenBank. Sequences were aligned
using the Clustal W program [56] and the phylogenetictree analysis was performed using the neighbor-joining
method (bootstrap resampling test with 1,000 replicates)
in MEGA version 3.0 software [57]. All sequences determined in this study have been deposited in the GenBank
database [GenBank: EF690470 – EF690536].
