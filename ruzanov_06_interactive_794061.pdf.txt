Abstract
Background: Application of phenetic methods to gene expression analysis proved to be a
successful approach. Visualizing the results in a 3-dimentional space may further enhance these
techniques.
Results: We designed and built TreeBuilder3D, an interactive viewer for visualizing the
hierarchical relationships between expression profiles such as SAGE libraries or microarrays. The
program allows loading expression data as plain text files and visualizing the relative differences of
the analyzed datasets in 3-dimensional space using various distance metrics.
Conclusion: TreeBuilder3D provides a simple interface and has a small size. Written in Java,
TreeBuilder3D is a platform-independent, open source application, which may be useful in analysis
of large-scale gene expression data.

Background
Development of high throughput transcription profiling
techniques such as microarrays and SAGE [2] has made it
possible to evaluate the expression levels of genes on a
genome wide scale. The ability to look at expression profiles of different cellular states has the potential to provide
knowledge about the mechanisms driving such important
events as differentiation, aging and tumorogenesis. In
addition to understanding transcription profiles of individual genes, the ability to visualize relationships between
whole sets of gene expression data provides the means to
infer higher-order relationships between the sampled biological conditions [8]. In this paper, we describe the
design and usage of an interactive viewer, which builds
hypothetical phenetic networks from SAGE expression
data. These networks may help to associate analyzed
SAGE libraries with some intermediate stages in the development of different cellular states or progress of disease,

such as cancer. As an example, we have used our program
to analyze publicly available SAGE data, but our application is also applicable to microarray data analysis.

Implementation and results
Traditionally, hierarchical data are presented as a rooted
or unrooted tree with bifurcating branches connecting different data points (nodes). Generally, only the distances
along the edges of the tree are shown proportionally. In a
non-reticulated tree, the distance between nodes that are
not directly connected is not easily visualized or understood. Building a hierarchical tree benefits by operating in
3-dimensional space, as such 3-dimensional structure
provides more details about the relationships between the
analyzed datasets.
The algorithm of building phenetic networks or dendrograms, which we have used for our viewer, is generally

Input formats
Input formats. Left: generic format, tab-delimited flat text file with (optional) fields "Total" and "Description", which may
provide the application with information about total number of tags in a library and an alternative description (different from id
string). The description becomes visible when user checks "Descr" box on the control panel. Right: data in GEO format. Highlighted are the fields, which are used for identification of the data-source and normalization of the tag counts. Also, it is possible to derive the short description from the field "Sample_title", which is analogous to the generic "Description" field.

applied in systematic biology. For systematic analysis,
tree-building techniques are designed to order data in
terms of phylogenetic relationships, from which evolutionary history can be inferred. In contrast, system analysis of SAGE and microarray data assumes that extraction
of order in the relationships between different gene
expression profiles and presents clues about biological
processes and functions on molecular, cellular and tissue
levels. Systematic approaches may allow improvement of
diagnosis, disease classification, and prognosis, as well as
assist in drug design, among other scientific and medical
goals.
We have developed a graphical viewer for analysis of the
hierarchical organization of cellular expression profiles,
analyzed by SAGE or microarray experiments. The output
diagram is a system of nodes, each of which represents a
SAGE or microarray experiment, and the connections
between nodes in the diagram. For each node, the relative
position on the graph depends on the differences between
its expression profile and the expression profiles of the
other analyzed nodes. In order to generate the diagram,
the user can choose a distance metric to generate the comparison. Our viewer currently offers five distance metrics,
all having a different approach to the estimation of the
distance between expression profiles. These metrics
include Euclidean, Manhattan, Pearson and Pearson

squared distances [4,5]. In addition, we have implemented a generic, 'quantitative' metric, which calculates
distance as a ratio of the number of differently expressed
genes to the number of similarly expressed genes (statistical significance of the difference in gene expression validated by Z-test as in [6])
The application loads the data from plain tab-delimited
text files. Currently, we provide support for two formats –
generic, tab-delimited with optional tags for description
and total number of tags in a SAGE library and GEO (files
of this type are downloadable from Gene Expression
Omnibus website [7]). Format of compatible files is
shown in Figure 1. The calculation of distances is performed via a pairwise analysis, so the distance value is calculated for each possible pair of SAGE or microarray
experiments. In all five cases the values are normalized
and put into an array, which is used to draw the graph.
This array, or 'distance matrix' may be exported as a plain
text file.
Our viewer automatically positions the analyzed nodes in
3D-space according to the calculated distances between
them. In comparison to traditional phenetic techniques,
mostly generating 2D-diagrams, this approach has several
advantages. The constraints imposed by 2D-space are
removed, so it is possible to get a more adequate snapshot

visualization of SAGE data for normal and cancerous brain tissue with TreeBuilder3D

visualization of SAGE data for normal and cancerous brain tissue with TreeBuilder3D. Above: the viewer panel
with SAGE data, visualized in 3D. The user can control the density of the graph (with the slider on the left) and visibility of the
edges, which are shorter than the threshold (with the top slider). Additional buttons on the right side of the panel are
explained on the diagram. It is also possible to pan/zoom/rotate using a 3-button mouse. Below: the control interface panel. A
typical session starts with opening files using "Load Data" button and picking the desired distance metric. After that a 3D diagram is generated and user can start to overview the structure, adding/dropping libraries, where desired.

of the system relationships between datasets. The nodes
are connected, and by default it is possible to change the
visibility for the connecting edges, adjusting the threshold
for maximal length to be shown. In addition, in the
default view mode the color of the edges reflects the tension, indicating if an edge is compressed or stretched. As
the initially displayed length of an edge may be different
from the calculated value for this connection, the user can
estimate how accurate the lengths of the edges are is by
looking at their color. TreeBuilder3D shows stretched
edges in blue and compressed edges in red. As an alternative way to filter out insignificant (very distant) connections, our viewer can use a simple aggregation algorithm,
analogous to Neighbor-joining method using arithmetic
averages, described in [1]. After the 'distance matrix' is
loaded into the viewer, nodes are placed randomly and
the application starts to move nodes in order to keep the
length of connecting edges proportional to their input values. The application's algorithm attempts to achieve the
most relaxed state of the graph, which should give the
most informative display of relationships between datasets, as at that point the displayed length of the edges
should become proportional to the input distances. The
relaxation algorithm checks one node at a time, making
the adjustments for the distances between the current
node and all the others. Eventually, after several cycles,
diagram becomes stabilized (nodes stop moving, as the
attracting and repelling forces balance each other). However, the absolute energetic minimum is rarely achieved –
especially, with large number of data points. We tested the
TreeBuilder3D, loading different number of SAGE libraries, and do not recommend opening more than 30 libraries, as it both degrades the performance of the application
and makes it harder to achieve minimum tension between
the nodes. Switching to NJ mode does not affect the placement of the nodes, but determines the branching order of
the network. It is possible to remove expression libraries
or to add them to the analyzed set interactively, while the
viewer automatically adjusts the diagram. The underlying
Java3D API allows manipulating the graph in 3D coordinates, so the user has the ability to pan, rotate or zoom in/
out. The viewer uses filenames as labels, which are shown
on the selection list, as well as on the graph next to the
nodes. Alternatively, the 'Description' option allows specification of an alternative description, which may be read
from the header of the files with expression data.
Figure 2 shows an example display of analysis done for
publicly available SAGE data. The analysis was performed
using SAGE data for 20 brain libraries, downloaded from
the Gene Expression Omnibus Website (contributed by
the laboratory of Dr. Riggins, John Hopkins University).
All libraries had a short description of their clinical source,
so it was possible to make some conclusions about quality
of the generated diagram. Among the analyzed SAGE

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/193

libraries 4 were prepared from normal brain tissue, while
the other 16 libraries were prepared from different tumor
samples. Although the brain tissue type for the libraries in
the set were very heterogeneous, there was a distinct separation of normal and cancer libraries on the diagram. All
normal libraries were directly connected and closely positioned on the graph, which shows that this approach to
visualization can be useful for extracting order from SAGE
data and organizing it into a meaningful structure. Files
with microarray data, loaded from GEO website, can also
be visualized in TreeBuilder3D.

Conclusion
TreeBuilder3D provides a simple, comprehensible view of
relationships in a hierarchy when applied to analysis of
large-scale gene expression data generated by methods
such as SAGE. An advantage of representing relationships
between gene expression profiles in a three dimensional
tree diagram is that it allows the visualization of subtleties
in internodal relationships that could be overlooked due
to the constraints imposed by a two-dimensional tree diagram. TreeBuilder3D allows the display of analyzed data
in a more natural and intuitive way.
