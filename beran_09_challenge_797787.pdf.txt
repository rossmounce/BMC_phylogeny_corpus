Abstract
Background: Our aim was to determine the efficacy of a trivalent inactivated split virus influenza vaccine
(TIV) against culture-confirmed influenza A and/or B in adults 18 to 64 years of age during the 2005/2006
season in the Czech Republic.
Methods: 6203 subjects were randomized to receive TIV (N = 4137) or placebo (N = 2066). The sample
size was based on an assumed attack rate of 4% which provided 90% power to reject the hypothesis that
vaccine efficacy (VE) was ≥ 45%. Cases of influenza like illness (defined as fever (oral temperature ≥37.8°C)
plus cough and/or sore throat) were identified both by active (biweekly phone contact) and passive (self
reporting) surveillance and nasal and throat swabs were collected from subjects for viral culture.
Results: TIV was well tolerated and induced a good immune response. The 2005/2006 influenza season
was exceptionally mild in the study area, as it was throughout Europe, and only 46 culture-confirmed cases
were found in the study cohort (10 influenza A and 36 influenza B). Furthermore among the B isolates, 35
were identified as B/Hong Kong 330/2001-like (B/Victoria/2/87 lineage) which is antigenically unrelated to
the vaccine B strain (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage). The attack rate in the vaccine group (0.7%) was not
statistically significantly different from the attack rate in the placebo group (0.9%).
Conclusion: Due to the atypical nature of the influenza season during this study we were unable to assess
TIV efficacy. This experience illustrates the challenge of conducting a prospective influenza vaccine efficacy
trial during a single season when influenza attack rates and drift in circulating strains or B virus lineage
match can be difficult to estimate in advance.

Background
Influenza is a highly contagious infectious disease resulting in acute respiratory illness in people of all ages.
Annual epidemics occur worldwide and cause substantial
morbidity and mortality [1,2]. Influenza poses a particular risk to the elderly and also to people suffering from
conditions such as chronic heart or pulmonary disease.
The causative agents are influenza A and influenza B
viruses and the main virulence factors are the virus surface
coat proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase
(NA). There are several antigenic forms of HA and NA for
influenza A which is classified into subtypes based on different combinations of these antigens [1,3,4]. Only a few
of these influenza A subtypes have ever been associated
with human disease and the subtypes currently in circulation in human hosts are H1N1 and H3N2 [5]. The influenza B virus currently belongs to two evolutionary
lineages that are distinct at the genetic and antigenic levels
and which are represented by B/Yamagata/16/88-like and
B/Victoria/2/87-like viruses that have co-circulated in the
population since the mid-1980s [5-8]. In order to evade
the host immune system, the HA and NA proteins of both
influenza A and influenza B viruses undergo continuous
mutation and by this mean evade the host immune system. This is known as antigenic or genetic drift [1,5,9,10].
Influenza vaccination has been employed for many years
as the primary tool to prevent influenza virus infection
and its complications [2]. As recommended by the World
Health Organization (WHO), vaccines are trivalent containing two influenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) and
one influenza B strain [1]. However, to ensure efficacy
against new drift variants the vaccine strains must be
updated on an annual basis for both the Northern and the
Southern hemisphere [11]. Based on epidemiology and
phylogenetic analysis of HA and NA sequences of the circulating human strains detected though a global influenza
surveillance network, WHO recommends the three strains
that are anticipated to become dominant during the next
influenza season [11]. Although in most years the recommendations accurately predict a close antigenic match
between the vaccine and circulating strains, occasionally a
predominant circulating strain turns out to be antigenically different from the corresponding vaccine strain. As
two influenza B virus lineages co-circulate, the current recommendation to include only one lineage in each year's
TIV poses a particular risk for a mismatch. Vaccine strain
mismatch can have a negative impact on vaccine efficacy
[9,10,12,13].
In this paper we describe an efficacy study conducted with
a trivalent inactivated split-virus influenza vaccine (TIV)
manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals which has
been available since 1987 and is now used in over 100
countries [4,14,15]. As for other inactivated influenza vac-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/2

cines, the ability of TIV to induce HA antibody levels (as
measured in hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) assay)
that meet regulatory authority criteria has been accepted
as a surrogate marker for efficacy [4,14,15]. Recently, this
TIV vaccine was approved under the United States' accelerated approval regulation [4,15]. To fulfill the requirements of this regulation, post-approval demonstration of
clinical benefit in an adequate and well-controlled clinical
trial is required.
We designed a placebo-controlled randomized efficacy
study with a primary clinical endpoint based upon rates of
culture-confirmed influenza A and/or B disease in a target
population of healthy adults with a broad age range of 18
to 64 years. All influenza vaccine efficacy studies are subject to the unpredictable nature of the intensity of the
influenza season in which they are conducted as well as
the extent of the antigenic match between the circulating
and vaccine strains [16]. As illustrated by the outcome of
this present study, these factors can have a substantial negative impact on the assessment of vaccine efficacy.

Methods
Study design and participants
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
study with two groups conducted in the Czech Republic in
the 2005–2006 influenza season (Clinical trial registery:
NCT00197223). The protocol and study documents were
approved by the University Hospital Hradec Kralové Ethics Committee (Sokolska, 581; 50005 Hradec Kralové,
Czech Republic). Our primary objective was to evaluate
the efficacy of TIV (2005/2006 Northern Hemisphere formulation) compared with placebo in the prevention of
culture-confirmed influenza A and/or B disease in adults.
A secondary objective was to assess the efficacy of TIV to
prevent influenza like illness (ILI) during the influenza
season (which was defined as starting the first week with
two culture-confirmed cases in the study area, and ending
the last week with one culture-confirmed case in the study
area). Other secondary objectives were the assessment of
the safety and also, in a subset of subjects, the assessment
of vaccine reactogenicity and immunogenicity.

Eligible participants were self-referred clinically healthy
male or female volunteers aged between 18 and 64 years
at the time of vaccination who provided written informed
consent. A randomisation list was generated by the sponsor by SAS program and used to number the vaccine and
placebo treatments (which were indistinguishable in
appearance). A randomization blocking scheme (2:1) was
employed to ensure that balance between treatments was
maintained. The randomization algorithm used a minimization procedure that accounted for prior influenza
vaccination, vaccine lots, and agreement to participate in
the immunogenicity/reactogenicity subset. Blinding to

treatment assignment was maintained until study analysis.
Vaccinations and blood sampling
Volunteers were randomized to receive one dose of TIV
(Fluarix™, a trade mark of GlaxoSmithKline group of companies (GSK)) or placebo at the first study visit (study Day
0) by intramuscular injection into the non-dominant deltoid muscle. Each 0.5-ml dose of TIV contained 15 μg each
of the hemagglutinin antigens of A/New Caledonia/20/99
(H1N1) IVR-116 virus as an A/New Caledonia/20/99-like
strain, A/New York/55/2004 (H3N2) X-157 virus as an A/
California/7/2004-like strain and B/Jiangsu/10/2003
virus as a B/Shanghai/361/2002-like strain. Placebo consisted of saline for injection.

Blood samples for the assessment of immunogenicity
were obtained from the planned randomly selected subset
of volunteers just prior to vaccination and at 21 days following vaccination.
Case definitions
Culture-confirmed influenza (primary endpoint) was
defined as an episode of influenza like illness (ILI) occurring after the administration of the study vaccine for
which a nasal and throat swab specimen yields influenza
virus A and/or B in cell culture.

ILI (secondary endpoint) was defined as fever (oral temperature ≥ 37.8°C) plus cough and/or sore throat [17]. An
ILI episode was defined as the period from the first day of
ILI symptoms until the last day of ILI symptoms. A new
episode was taken into account only after the complete
resolution of the previous one. Between two ILI episodes,
there had to be at least 7 days free of any symptoms.
Follow up of subjects
From the day of vaccination all subjects were instructed to
report any ILI symptoms to the investigator via a toll free
line (passive surveillance for ILI). Active surveillance for
ILI began 2 weeks after the administration of the study
vaccine until study end (April 2006). This involved
biweekly telephone contact of the subjects to remind
them to notify the investigator at the onset of ILI symptoms, to identify ILI episodes which may have been unreported, and to collect information on the occurrence of
medical visits and possible serious adverse events.

For each case of suspected ILI, a study nurse visited the
subject, (as far as possible on the same day) and collected
a nasal and throat swab sample (comprised of a swab of
both nasal cavities and a second swab of the throat) for
culture. Subjects were each provided with a calibrated
thermometer to measure temperature and a diary card to
record temperatures and symptoms during the influenza

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/2

like illness episode. All samples were to be obtained, if
possible, before antimicrobial/influenza antiviral therapy
was started.
A randomly selected subset of subjects were assessed for
reactogenicity using diary cards to record the presence and
intensity of injection site solicited adverse events (pain,
redness and swelling) and general solicited adverse events
(fatigue, fever, headache, muscle aches, shivering and
joint pain) experienced during the first 4 days after vaccination. The diameters of any injection site redness or
swelling and daily body temperature were recorded. The
intensities of other adverse events were recorded according to a standard 0 to 3 grade scale: "absent", "easily tolerated", "interferes with normal activity" and "prevents
normal activity". Data were also collected on the occurrence and intensity of any spontaneous unsolicited signs
or symptoms occurring within 21 days following vaccination. These diary cards were reviewed during the blood
sampling visit at Day 21. Collection of data on serious
adverse events (SAEs) began at the receipt of vaccine/placebo and continued until the end of the study.
At the end of the study the investigator made a study conclusion contact with all subjects.
Laboratory assays
Serum samples were stored at -20°C until blinded analyses were conducted at GSK Biologicals SSW Dresden, Germany. All samples were tested in a validated micro-titer
hemagglutination-inhibition test using chicken red blood
cells with the three virus strains present in the TIV used as
antigens as previously described [14]. The serum titer was
expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that
showed complete inhibition of hemagglutination.

Nasal and throat swab samples were stored at 2–8°C and
transferred within 24 hours to the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza (NRL, Prague, Czech Republic) for
conventional influenza virus culture in Madin Darby
Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells as described elsewhere
[18,19]. Cell culture supernatants were tested for the presence of influenza virus by hemagglutination assay with
turkey and guinea pig erythrocytes [18,19]. Hemagglutination inhibition was used to identify virus type, subtype
and drift variant [18,19]. Cell culture supernatants were
also tested by a direct immunoperoxidase assay using
anti-influenza A and anti-influenza B nucleoprotein antibodies [20].
Statistical Analysis
The sample size for the primary endpoint was estimated
on the basis of an assumed influenza attack rate of 4% of
culture-confirmed influenza disease (type A and/or B)
among placebo recipients, a vaccine efficacy (VE) of 70%,

BMC Infectious Diseases 2009, 9:2

and 90% power to detect vaccine efficacy with a lower
limit of the 95% CI for efficacy >45% with alpha = 0.025
(1-sided). A sample size of 5591 evaluable subjects was
required to allow the rejection of the null hypothesis that
the vaccine efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza
illness was ≤ 45%. To account for an assumed dropout
rate of 10%, we planned to enroll a minimum of 6213
subjects. According to the planned 2:1 treatment allocation approximately 4142 and 2071 subjects were to
receive TIV and placebo respectively. Based on the
assumptions of attack rate and vaccine efficacy a total of
119 culture-confirmed influenza illness episodes were
anticipated with approximately 75 episodes in the placebo group.
All data analyses were conducted according to a pre-specified plan prepared by GSK and submitted to the United
States Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research
(CBER). The vaccine efficacy against culture-confirmed
influenza A or B was defined as 1 minus the relative risk
of culture-confirmed influenza among the TIV group versus the placebo group and calculated using the classical
formula of Greenwood and Yule [21] with the 95% exact
confidence intervals (CI). The attack rate was the number
of subjects experiencing at least one episode of cultureconfirmed influenza A or B within the observation period
divided by the total number of subjects in the group. Analysis of vaccine efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza A or B was performed on the total cohort for efficacy
(Figure 1) while analysis of vaccine efficacy against ILI
during the influenza season was performed on the according to protocol (ATP) cohort for efficacy in the influenza
season (Figure 1).

Results
Baseline characteristic
The total cohort for efficacy and safety (N = 6203 subjects)
included 4137 subjects vaccinated with TIV and 2066 subjects vaccinated with placebo (Figure 1). The demographic
profiles of the TIV and placebo groups in this cohort were
comparable with respect to mean age (35 ± 13 years in
both groups), gender (55.3% and 54.2% female in the TIV
and placebo groups respectively) and racial distribution
(99.8% white Caucasian in both groups). In both groups
the majority of subjects (91.5% and 91.7%) had no history of influenza vaccination within the last 3 influenza
seasons prior to enrolment.
Efficacy
During the study surveillance period (September 2005 to
April 2006), 814 episodes of ILI were evaluated with the
peak incidence occurring between November 2005 and
March 2006 (110–125 cases per month). Swab specimens
were obtained from all cases within 5 days of the onset of
ILI with the majority (742/814, 91%) collected by Day 2.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/2

There were 46 culture-confirmed cases, 10 positive for
influenza A and 36 for influenza B (Table 1) which
occurred between January and April 2006. Seven of the
ten influenza A isolates were identified by hemagglutination inhibition titration and characterised as being antigenically related to the H1N1 or H3N2 vaccine strains
(Table 1). Of the 36 influenza B isolates, 35 were identified by hemagglutination inhibition titration and characterized as B/Hong Kong 330/2001-like (from the B/
Victoria/2/87 lineage) which is antigenically distinct to
the B strain from the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage contained
in the vaccine. No mixed influenza infections were identified.
As indicated in Table 2 the attack rate for culture-confirmed influenza A or B in the placebo group was 0.9%
which was well below the assumed attack rate of 4% on
which the sample size was based to offer 90% power to
reject the null hypothesis that VE was ≤ 45%. The attack
rate in the vaccine group (0.7%) was not statistically significantly different so the null hypothesis could not be
rejected and the efficacy of TIV against culture-confirmed
influenza A or B could not be demonstrated (estimate of
efficacy of 22.3% with 95% CI of -49.1% to 58.5%). The
attack rate for culture-confirmed influenza A in the placebo group was very low at only 0.2%. For culture-confirmed influenza B (Table 2), the attack rates were 0.7% in
the placebo group and 0.5% in the vaccine group and the
lower limit of confidence for the estimate of 21.5% efficacy was again a negative value (95% CI -65.9% to 61.6).
Similarly the attack rates for clinical ILI episodes during
the influenza season were not statistically different
between the vaccine (6%) and placebo (5.6%) groups and
so efficacy against clinical ILI episodes could also not be
demonstrated (Table 3).
Safety and reactogenicity
The percentage of subjects reporting an SAE was the same
(2.3%) in each group. No SAEs were reported as being
related to vaccination.

Vaccination with TIV was associated with a higher incidence of solicited injection site reactions, in particular
pain at the injection site (Figure 2). The majority of these
reactions in TIV recipients were mild to moderate in intensity. No events were classified as preventing daily activities
and the incidences of local redness and swelling reactions
above 50 mm diameter were low (1.7% and 2.3% respectively). All resolved without sequelae. Rates of solicited
general symptoms also tended to be higher in the TIV
group (Figure 3). Fatigue was the most common solicited
general symptom reported as related to vaccination in
both groups (TIV 23.4% and placebo 15.9%). The majority of reactions in TIV recipients were mild to moderate in
intensity, there were no reports of fever >39°C and the

and headache). Rates of spontaneously reported symptoms were similar in both groups both overall (TIV 11.1%

Immunogenicity
Table 4 demonstrates that TIV elicited an antibody
response (as assessed by hemagglutination-inhibition)
against all three vaccine strains which exceeded the
required Committee for Medicinal Products for Human
Use (CHMP) [22] and CBER [23] criteria for seroconversion and seroprotection rates.

rates exceeded regulatory authority criteria. Despite this,
the vaccine efficacy was not confirmed.
Influenza vaccine efficacy in a particular region depends
on the nature of the influenza season. This can vary from
year to year and as it cannot be predicted in advance,
poses a particular challenge for the conduct of a prospective efficacy study. The optimal circumstances in which to
evaluate the efficacy of influenza vaccines are i) high viral
circulation (i.e. high attack rate) and ii) when the vaccine
strains are antigenically-matched to the circulating virus
types [16,24]. The 2005–2006 influenza season in the
Czech Republic was exceptional in that both of these factors turned out to be suboptimal for the conduct of an efficacy study.

Discussion
This paper describes the outcome of a placebo-controlled
randomized efficacy study with a trivalent inactivated
split virus influenza vaccine (TIV) in healthy adults aged
18 to 64 years. The immunogenicity of TIV was consistent
with previous studies in adults [4,15] and seroprotection

The first issue faced by the study was the very low attack
rate. The study was powered based on the assumption that
the attack rate of culture-confirmed influenza in the placebo group would be 4% while the actual attack rate during the study was 0.9%. Literature data are limited on the
attack rates of culture-confirmed influenza cases in an

unvaccinated adult population and serology has been very
often used alone or combined as a diagnostic tool to confirm the influenza virus etiology of a clinical case. The
attack rate of 4% was hence selected as a conservative estimate based upon data from randomized placebo influenza vaccine studies in healthy adults with laboratory (by
serology or a mixture of serology and culture) confirmed
endpoints reviewed in the Cochrane data base [3]. These
indicated an attack rate range of 6% to 16% in the placebo
groups. More recently, prospective placebo-controlled trials have reported rates of culture-confirmed cases in the
adult setting [25,26] as well as in children [27]. These
studies clearly confirmed the high year-to-year variability
of documented influenza cases.
The low number of culture-confirmed influenza cases
found during our study was unlikely to be due to inadequate monitoring of prospective cases, as active surveillance for ILI involving contact of subjects by phone on a
biweekly basis was employed. Also, all nasal and throat
swab specimens were transported to the laboratory with
an adequate cold chain within 24 hours to avoid false culture negatives due to loss of virus viability. Furthermore,
the low attack rate observed in the study area in 2005–
2006 was confirmed by the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS) [28]. Specific data for the Czech
Republic demonstrate that the weekly morbidity rates for
both acute respiratory infections [29] and for ILI [30] were
lower in the 2005/2006 influenza season compared to
both the previous 2004/2005 season and also the following 2006/2007 season. The EISS also reported that the circulation of influenza B virus in the winter 2005–2006 was
exceptional compared with European data accumulated
during the last decade, as it was the only season in which
influenza B viruses were dominant [28]. It is possible that
this may have contributed to the low attack rate of clinical
illness as influenza B is known to cause milder disease
than influenza A [28,31].

The significant impact that a lower attack rate can have on
a clinical trial to evaluate influenza vaccine efficacy has
previously been illustrated in a clinical trial conducted by
Hoberman and colleagues in young children over two
consecutive influenza seasons in Pittsburg [27]. In the first
season (1999/2000) when the attack rate for culture-confirmed influenza was 15.9% in the placebo group, vaccine
efficacy was estimated to be 65% (95% CI 34% to 82%)
while in the second season (2000/2001) when the attack
rate for culture-confirmed influenza was 3.3% in the placebo group, vaccine efficacy was estimated to be -7%
(95% CI -247% to 67%). A similar finding was recently
reported in a study conducted over 2 years in an adult
population in Michigan [25,26]. The attack rate of cultureconfirmed influenza in the placebo group was reported to
be 5.8%, whereas in the second year, a rate of 1.8% was
found. The VE estimates for the inactivated influenza vaccine were found to be 77% (37% to 92%) in year 1 and
23% (-153% to 73%) in year 2. The latter result appears to
be similar to the outcome of our study in adults where
with an attack rate in the placebo group of 0.9% for influenza A and/or B cases and 0.2% for influenza A cases, the
respective estimate of efficacies were 22.3% (95% CI 49.1% to 58.5%) and 25.1% (95% CI of -260.9% to
82.2%).
These data indicate that the possibility of a lower than predicted attack rate needs to be factored into the design of
influenza vaccine efficacy studies. Apart from increasing
the sample size or allowing for an extension of the study
over more than one influenza season, another factor to be
considered is the clinical case definition used. There is no
universally accepted clinical case definition of influenza
[32,33]. We employed a definition from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) US based on the
presence of fever plus either cough or sore throat, [17].
This combination of symptoms is recognized as having a
high positive predictive value for influenza but is not very
sensitive [34]. For seasons with low attack rates it may be

preferable to improve case capture by using less restrictive
clinical criteria particularly when culture confirmation is
being employed to confer specificity. The use of reverse
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays techniques,
which have been shown to be more sensitive than culture,
may also improve detection of influenza virus in nasal/
throat specimens [35,36]. Serological analysis of acute
and convalescent sera, which is also often used to confirm
influenza cases, would however have specific limitations
in a vaccine efficacy study. In the vaccine group, the presence of vaccine-induced antibodies could mask differ-

The low attack rates encountered in the adult population
during some influenza seasons may raise the question
about the need for adult vaccination. It should be kept in
mind that currently the main target populations for adult
vaccination (apart from the elderly persons, which are
outside the scope of this study) are adults who have medical conditions that place them at risk for complications
from influenza and also, in order to limit influenza virus
transmission to those at risk in all age groups, health-care
personnel or caregivers [2]. As the attack rate for any coming influenza season is unpredictable at the time of
annual influenza vaccination, it is not feasible to modify
vaccination routines and put susceptible people at risk.
The second issue faced by the study was a mismatch
between the dominant circulating influenza strain and the
vaccine strains. The majority of culture-confirmed cases
detected in our study were caused by an influenza B strain
that was of a different lineage to the vaccine influenza B
component which was from the B/Yamagata/16/88-lineage. This mismatch was confirmed by the EISS who
reported that 90% of the characterized influenza B viruses
in Europe during the influenza season 2005–2006 were
similar to the B/Victoria/2/87 lineage of influenza B
viruses [28]. As a consequence, the World Health Organization (WHO) substituted a virus from the B/Victoria/2/
87 lineage in the 2006–2007 vaccine recommendations
[37].
The co-circulation of these two antigenically distinct B lineages which form distinctly divergent genetic groups
based on their hemagglutinin genes where there are some
27 amino acid differences [8] has raised the question of

* Seroconversion rate for Hemagglutination-inhibition antibody response is defined as the percentage of vaccinees who have a prevaccination titer
< 1:10 and a post-vaccination titer ≥ 1:40, or who have a prevaccination titer ≥ 1:10 and at least a fourfold increase in post-vaccination titer

whether they should both be represented in the annual
influenza vaccine formulation [38]. To date, this option
has not been considered due to the constraints it would
impose on an already limited influenza antigen manufacturing capacity. Also, although there is no hemagglutinin
cross reactivity between the two B lineages in ferrets [7] or
unprimed children [39], serological evidence from WHO
[37] and another recent study [40] indicates that vaccine
B/Yamagata/16/88-lineage components may provide
reduced protection against the B/Victoria/2/87 lineage.
Furthermore, reassortment between the two influenza B
lineages has led to practically all B/Victoria-lineage viruses
containing a B/Yamagata-lineage neuraminidase which
may also provide some cross protection [13,38]. Other
workers have managed to demonstrate vaccine efficacy for
influenza B despite mismatch between vaccine and circulating strains [13,25]. In the Michigan study, Ohmit et. al
demonstrated efficacy against influenza B during a mismatch of B strains in the 2004/2005 season [25]. However, the attack rate for culture-confirmed influenza in the
placebo group in that study was considerably higher
(5.8%) than in the study reported here and also a greater
proportion of the influenza B isolates did match the vaccine strain (7 out of 18).
Although the exceptional nature of the influenza season
in which this study was conducted did not allow us to
establish the efficacy of TIV it is likely that, as demonstrated by Ohmit et al for another inactivated vaccine [25],
TIV efficacy could be demonstrated under more typical
influenza season conditions.

Conclusion
Due to the exceptionally low attack rate during the 2005/
2006 season in the Czech Republic and the predominance

of a circulating B strain of a different lineage to the vaccine
strain, our study was unable to demonstrate the efficacy of
TIV in healthy adults. This experience illustrates the challenge of conducting an influenza vaccine efficacy trial during one season when variations in disease attack rates and
circulating strains cannot be predicted in advance.
