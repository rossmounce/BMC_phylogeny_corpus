Abstract
Background: Metagenomics, the application of molecular genomics to consortia of non-cultivated microbes, has
the potential to have a substantial impact on the search for novel industrial enzymes such as esterases (carboxyl
ester hydrolases, EC 3.1.1.1) and lipases (triacylglycerol lipases, EC 3.1.1.3). In the current work, a novel lipase gene
was identified from a fosmid metagenomic library constructed with the “prokaryotic-enriched” DNA from a fatcontaminated soil collected from a wastewater treatment plant.
Results: In preliminary screening on agar containing 1% tributyrin, 2661 of the approximately 500,000 clones in the
metagenomic library showed activity. Of these, 127 showed activity on agar containing 1% tricaprylin, while 32
were shown to be true lipase producers through screening on agar containing 1% triolein. The clone with the
largest halo was further characterized. Its lipase gene showed 72% identity to a putative lipase of Yersinia
enterocolitica subsp. palearctica Y11. The lipase, named LipC12, belongs to family I.1 of bacterial lipases, has a
chaperone-independent folding, does not possess disulfide bridges and is calcium ion dependent. It is stable from
pH 6 to 11 and has activity from pH 4.5 to 10, with higher activities at alkaline pH values. LipC12 is stable up to 3.7
M NaCl and from 20 to 50°C, with maximum activity at 30°C over a 1 h incubation. The pure enzyme has specific
activities of 1722 U/mg and 1767 U/mg against olive oil and pig fat, respectively. Moreover, it is highly stable in
organic solvents at 15% and 30% (v/v).
Conclusions: The combination of the use of a fat-contaminated soil, enrichment of prokaryotic DNA and a threestep screening strategy led to a high number of lipase-producing clones in the metagenomic library. The most
notable properties of the new lipase that was isolated and characterized were a high specific activity against long
chain triacylglycerols, activity and stability over a wide range of pH values, good thermal stability and stability in
water-miscible organic solvents and at high salt concentrations. These characteristics suggest that this lipase has
potential to perform well in biocatalytic processes, such as for hydrolysis and synthesis reactions involving longchain triacylglycerols and fatty acid esters.

Background
Lipases (triacylglycerol lipases, EC 3.1.1.3) are enzymes
that act on ester bonds, either hydrolyzing or synthesizing them, depending on the amount of water in the
reaction medium [1-3]. True lipases attack triacylglycerols that contain long-chain fatty acids. They are
important biocatalysts for various biotechnological
applications due to their useful features, such as stability in organic solvents, broad substrate specificity,
stereoselectivity and regioselectivity [4].

Although lipases can be obtained from plants and animals, microbial lipases possess useful features such as
high yield and low production cost, diversity in catalytic
activities, amenability to genetic manipulation, stability
in organic solvents and broad substrate specificity [5].
While a large number of different lipases have been discovered and commercialized [4], new lipases with better
characteristics are desirable, such as high activity and
stability in non-aqueous media, which are useful for biodiesel production through transesterification [6-8],
regiospecificity for the modification of oils and fats to
produce specific-structured lipids [9,10] and stability

under alkaline conditions and in the presence of surfactants for use in detergent formulations [11].
The vast majority of lipases that are currently used
industrially were isolated from cultivated microbes [12],
however, in more recent times, it has become difficult
to obtain truly different lipases by this method. To overcome this limitation, molecular biology and protein
engineering strategies have been used, such as directed
evolution [13], rational design [14,15] and metagenomics
[16-20].
The metagenomics approach, the application of molecular genomics to consortia of non-cultivated microbes,
has a substantial impact on the search for novel industrial enzymes due to the vast diversity of genetic material analyzed [21-24]. The advantage of metagenomics
can be summarized in numerical terms since more than
99% of microorganisms are not amenable to cultivation
[25], either due to their required growth conditions
being unknown or to their need to grow within a microbial consortium.
Although various esterases and so-called lipases have
been isolated through the metagenomic approach over
the last decade [26-31], relatively few papers report true
lipases [32-37]. Several of the enzymes obtained have
activity against medium-chain triacylglycerols, longchain monoacyl glycerols or long-chain nitrophenyl acyl
esters, but do not have activity against triacylglycerols
that contain long-chain fatty acids, such as vegetable
oils or animal fats. For example, the so-called PLP and
Est1 lipases, both of which were isolated through the
metagenomic approach [38], and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius lipase [39] are active against p-nitrophenyl palmitate
(pNPP) but not against trioleoylglycerol. As a result,
these so-called lipases simply cannot be considered as
true lipases.
As new lipases with high activity against oils and fats
have industrial potential, in the current work we used
three strategies in combination in an attempt to
improve the chances of obtaining a true lipase through
the metagenomic approach, namely (i) a high-fat soil as
the original source of the DNA, (ii) a prokaryotic DNA
enrichment step and (iii) a three-stage screening strategy
in which the third stage tested for true lipase activity.

Results
Sample collection, metagenomic library construction and
activity screening

Samples were collected from the bank of an anaerobic
lagoon of the wastewater treatment plant of a meat
packing and dairy industry. The effluent from the plant
has a high animal fat content that contaminates the soil
surrounding the lagoon, presumably favoring the development of a microbiota capable of degrading fats.

Consequently, this soil sample should be enriched with
lipase genes.
The generated metagenomic library has approximately
500,000 clones. The screening strategy used involved the
use of LB agar with two or more different types of triacylglycerols to differentiate lipases from esterases
[19,40]. Thus, the 2,661 clones that showed activity
against tributyrin (Figure 1a) were screened on LB agar
containing 1% (v/v) tricaprylin and 127 clones with
activity were selected. In order to identify true-lipase
producers, these clones were screened on LB agar containing 1% (v/v) triolein, resulting in 32 with activity.
Three clones, FosC12, FosE6 and FosH10, which showed
the largest hydrolysis halos on triolein (Figure 1b), were
selected for further characterization.
Sequencing of LipC12 and preliminary sequence analysis

The fosmids FosC12, FosE6 and FosH10 were fragmented by nebulization and subcloned into the pUC18 vector, producing three subclone libraries. The inserts of
subclones that expressed lipolytic activity on tributyrin
agar plates were fully sequenced and sequence comparison revealed that all three fosmids contained the same
lipase gene (result not shown). The lipase gene from
fosmid FosC12, denominated lipC12, was selected for
further characterization. Amino acid sequence alignment
showed that lipC12 codes for a lipase having 72% identity to the putative lipase of Yersinia enterocolitica
subsp. palearctica Y11 [GenBank:CBY26912]. Neither
transmembrane domains nor a signal peptide were identified and LipC12 was predicted to be a soluble protein.
No chaperone sequence gene located close to the lipC12
gene was found in the lipC12 contig, suggesting that
LipC12 has a chaperone-independent folding.
The lipC12 gene was amplified and cloned into pET28a(+) and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells to
express the N-terminal (His)6-tagged protein. No mutation occurred in the lipC12 sequence in the course of
these cloning procedures.
Overexpression and purification of LipC12 lipase

The overexpressed LipC12 has a molecular weight of 33
395.8 Da and was in the soluble fraction, as judged by
SDS-PAGE (result not shown). BL21(DE3) cells carrying
the pET28a-lipC12 plasmid were induced at 20°C for 16
h to maximize the protein yield. LipC12 was purified in
one step using a HiTrap Chelating HP affinity column,
as shown by SDS-PAGE of eluted fractions (Figure 1c).
The eluted fractions containing LipC12 were combined
and dialyzed against Tris-HCl buffer to concentrate the
protein solution and eliminate imidazol. Glycerol at 50%
(w/v) final concentration was added to the protein storage buffer as a cryoprotective agent. The enzyme

preparation (5.78 μg/μL) was more than 97% pure as
judged by densitometric analysis of SDS-PAGE.
Zymogram and mass spectrometry analysis

Zymographic analysis was carried out using tributyrin
and tricaprylin as substrates. The clear bands that were
obtained in the 30 kDa region using both substrates
reveal that the purified enzyme was active, with a larger
clearing zone occurring in the tricaprylin gel than in the
tributyrin gel (Figure 1d). MALDI-TOF/MS confirmed
that the purified enzyme is LipC12, with 68.4% of
sequence coverage (result not shown). Together, these
results confirm the identity of the purified protein.
Protein sequence analysis

LipC12 has 293 amino acids and an identity of 72% with
the putative lipases of Yersinia enterocolitica subsp.
palearctica Y11 [GenBank:CBY26912] and of Yersinia
enterocolitica subsp. enterocolitica 8081 [GenBank:
YE1842]. The domain analysis carried out using Pfam
showed that the enzyme probably has a type I a/b-

hydrolase fold [41] between residues 23 and 227. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the most similar enzymes
to LipC12 are those from enterobacteria, such as Yersinia sp., Proteus sp. and Arsenophonus sp. (Figure 2).
Among the lipases that have known 3D structure,
LipC12 possesses 47%, 41% and 41% of identity with
lipases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa [PDB:1EX9A], Burkholderia glumae [PDB:2ES4B] and Burkholderia cepacia [PDB:1OILA], respectively.
The LipC12 catalytic triad is predicted to be formed
by Ser83, Asp238 and His260 (Figure 3) and the nucleophilic Ser83 residue appears in the conserved pentapeptide Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly [41]. Two Asp residues of LipC12
(Asp217 and Asp262) form a calcium binding pocket that
is conserved in lipases of subfamilies I.1 and I.2 [42,43].
LipC12 contains only one Cys residue, similar to the
lipases of Pseudomonas fragi [GenBank:CAC07191], Proteus vulgaris [GenBank:AAB01071, GenBank:
ACM67042], Yersinia enterocolitica [GenBank:
CBY26912, GenBank:YE1842] and Yersinia mollaretti
[GenBank:ZP_04641632], and therefore does not form a

Figure 2 Phylogenetic analysis of LipC12 and closely related proteins. The enzymes most similar to LipC12 are those from Enterobacteria,
such as Yersinia sp., Proteus sp. and Arsenophonus sp. LipC12 is a member of subfamily I.1 [42], with closest homology to Yersinia sp. lipases.
Except for LipC12, the protein sequences were retrieved from GenBank (NCBI). The phylogenetic tree was generated using MEGA 5 [65]. The

disulfide bridge as found in the lipases of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa [PDB:1EX9A], Burkholderia glumae
[PDB:2ES4B] and Burkholderia cepacia [PDB:1OILA].
The expression of lipases belonging to subfamilies I.1
and I.2 in an active form often depends on a chaperone
protein named lipase-specific foldase, Lif, that is usually
encoded in an operon with its cognate lipase [1,42].
This chaperone is absent in the LipC12 operon and has
not yet been found or described for the lipases of subfamily I.1 that have the highest identities with LipC12,
as is the case of Yersinia enterocolitica [GenBank:
CBY26912, GenBank:YE1842], Yersinia mollaretti [GenBank:ZP_04641632], Proteus vulgaris [GenBank:

AAB01071, GenBank:ACM67042] and Pseudomonas
fragi [GenBank:CAC07191] lipases. Thus, it is possible
to conclude that LipC12 belongs to subfamily I.1.
Spectrophotometric determinations of lipase activity
using pNP substrates
Effect of chelating agents and metal ions on LipC12 activity

LipC12 activity decreases in the presence of the chelating agents EDTA and EGTA, more intensely so for
EGTA, which preferentially binds calcium (Table 1).
This result suggested that calcium might be a preferred
cofactor of LipC12. To check whether LipC12 has a preference for binding Ca 2+ , an experiment was done in

residues of the active site (as), cysteine residues forming the disulfide bridge (db) and aspartic residues involved in the calcium binding domains
(cb) are annotated. Shaded regions indicate similar amino acids in all the aligned sequences. The accession number and the organism name of

which the metal was depleted by EDTA prior to the
testing of the activity in the presence of excess metal.
Maximum activity was achieved with the addition of
Ca2+, but activity was also restored at lower levels in the
presence of other divalent cations, such as Cu2+, Co2+,
Mn2+ and Ni2+. This result, when taken together with
the presence of a putative calcium binding pocket, is
strong evidence for LipC12 being calcium ion dependent. In experiments undertaken without a prior chelation step, in which the calcium binding pocket was
presumably occupied by a calcium ion, the presence of
1 mM of monovalent cations (Rb+, K+, Cs+, Na+ or Li+)
enhanced LipC12 activity (Table 1). The most likely
explanation for this is that the presence of these cations
improves the solubility of pNPP within the emulsion.
Evidence of this increase in solubility is given by the

fact that at 1.5 M NaCl the pNPP emulsion remained
transparent even without heating.
Effect of anions on the LipC12 activity

The effect of anions on LipC12 activity was also tested.
All anions used were added in the form of sodium salts
and none showed a significant effect on activity at 1
mM (Table 1). However, PO43- at 10 mM decreased the
enzyme activity by about 30%, suggesting that PO 4 3competes with LipC12 for Ca2+.
LipC12 enantioselectivity and substrate specificity against
pNP esters

LipC12 is most active against longer-chain nitrophenyl
acyl esters, with relative activities above 75% for evennumbered acyl chain lengths from C10:0 to C16:0 (Table
1). For shorter acyl chain lengths (C2:0 to C6:0), the relative activities are below 35%. This preference for longer

chain lengths is typical of a true lipase and not an esterase
[1]. In the Quick E test for enantioselectivity, LipC12 gave
an S/R rate ratio of 1.53 ± 0.05 with pure glycidyl butyrate
enantiomers, indicating that LipC12 is not enantioselective
for this compound under the conditions of the experiment. However, this does not eliminate the possibility that

LipC12 will show enantioselectivity for other compounds
or under other reaction conditions.
Effect of detergents, gum arabic and modifying agents on
LipC12 activity

Detergents such as Triton X-100 are usually added to
lipase substrate emulsions to improve the emulsion

quality, making the substrate more accessible. However,
depending on the concentration used, detergents can
also cause lipases to denature. For LipC12, at 0.1% (v/v)
concentration, the detergents CTAB, NLS and Triton X100 enhanced the activity up to 175% (Table 1). NP40
had no effect and SDS inhibited the activity by about
50%. Although Tween 20, 40 and 60 are non-ionic
detergents, as are Triton X-100 and NP40, they inhibited the activity as much or more than SDS. This effect
is probably due to the long acyl ester chains of these
detergents making them substrates for LipC12 and
therefore competitive inhibitors in the assay. Interestingly, Tween 80 was the most effective inhibitor of
pNPP hydrolysis, suggesting that LipC12 has a preference for esters of C18 fatty acids over C16 (Tween 40)
and C12 (Tween 20). At 1% (v/v), all detergents
decreased the activity significantly, with LipC12 tolerating best NP40 and Triton X-100. Since gum arabic is
often added to stabilize lipase substrate emulsions [44],
it is important to know its effect on LipC12 activity. At
0.5% (w/v) the relative activity almost doubled. Modifying agents such as PMSF (specific inhibitor of serine
hydrolases) and DEPC (histidine residue modifier) at 1
mM concentrations strongly reduced LipC12 activity
(Table 1). This effect suggests that LipC12 does indeed
have a catalytic triad containing serine and histidine
residues [3].

Residual activity of LipC12 after incubation in organic
solvents

The activities of LipC12 after 48 h incubation at 4°C in
15% and 30% (v/v) of organic solvents was inhibited
only in the cases of 15% (v/v) acetone and 15% (v/v)
acetonitrile (Table 2). In all other cases the LipC12
activity after incubation was stimulated. This phenomenon is in fact quite well known. For example, Candida
rugosa lipase is activated by organic solvents, which
keep the lid of the enzyme in the open conformation,
facilitating the access of the substrate to the active site
[45,46]. Although the three-dimensional structure of
LipC12 has not yet been determined, the increased
LipC12 activity in this experiment suggests the existence
of a lid that is converted from closed to open conformation in the presence of organic solvents. These findings
are particularly significant, due to the fact that organic
solvents have been used in biodiesel production through
biocatalysis.
Effect of NaCl and KCl concentrations on LipC12 activity
and stability

Addition of NaCl to a pNPP emulsion until 1.5 M
increased LipC12 activity up to 15 fold (Table 1), however, the activity decreased with further increases in the
NaCl concentration. Since LipC12 is stable at NaCl concentrations up to 3.7 M (Table 2) the decrease in activity above 1.5 M is probably due to decreased substrate

solubility, which was indicated by the emulsion becoming turbid at 3 M NaCl. The same results about LipC12
stability were observed for KCl (results not shown).
Enzyme stability at high salt concentrations might indicate that the enzyme will be stable in the low water
activity environments that occur in biocatalytic reactions
carried out in organic solvents [47].
Effect of pH on LipC12 stability

Determination of the pH stability of enzymes is important for identifying nondenaturing pH values of buffers
for purification, storage and reaction steps. LipC12
showed a broad pH tolerance, with over 90% residual
activity after 24 h incubation at pH values ranging from
6.0 to 11.0 (Table 2). At pH 3 LipC12 lost all activity
and in the range of 4.0 to 5.5 the residual activity was
between 70 and 90%. The enzyme showed a local stability minimum at pH 5.5, probably caused by isoelectric
precipitation [48].
Effect of temperature on LipC12 activity and stability

In an enzymatic process there is a critical play between
thermostability and the effect of temperature on activity.
It is necessary to identify a reaction temperature that at
the same time allows a reasonably high rate of reaction
and keeps the rate of denaturation at a reasonably low
level. LipC12 showed maximum activity at 30°C (Table
1) when incubated for 1 h and enzyme stability (during
1 h incubation) was not affected up to 50°C (Table 2).
After 1 h at 70°C the enzyme retained about 65% of its
original activity.
Titrimetric determinations of lipase activity using
triacylglycerol substrates
LipC12 substrate specificity against triacylglycerols

As shown in Figure 4a, LipC12 was most active against
tributyrin (2187 U/mg), pig fat (1767 U/mg) and olive

Page 8 of 15

oil (1722 U/mg), with relatively low activities against tripropionin (344 U/mg), castor oil (215 U/mg) and triacetin (28 U/mg). On the other hand, zymogram analysis
(Figure 1d) and plate screening tests (results not shown)
showed larger hydrolysis halos against trioctanoin than
against tributyrin. In addition, when using pNP substrates, LipC12 showed a preference for the C16 rather
than the C4 acyl group. These results can be explained
by the fact that the activity not only depends on the
length of the acyl chain, but is also affected by factors
such as the presence or absence of insaturations or
hydroxyl groups in the acyl chain, the solubility of the
triacylglycerol and the quality of the emulsion. LipC12
showed a relatively low activity against castor oil, probably because of the unusual hydroxyl functional group
on the twelfth carbon of the ricinoleic acid.
Effect of pH on LipC12 activity

The effect of pH on activity was studied using tributyrin,
in order to reduce buffering effects in the titrations: tributyrin has the smallest correction factor, due to its
lower pKa, compared with tricaprylin and triolein. Over
a pH range of 4 to 10, LipC12 displayed more than 90%
relative activity at pH values above 7; the maximum
activity was at pH 10 and no activity was observed
below pH 4.5 (Figure 4b). Thus this lipase is more active
under neutral and alkaline conditions. Measurements at
pH 11 and above were unreliable due to nonenzymatic
tributyrin hydrolysis.

Discussion
The combination of fat contaminated soil and the prokaryotic DNA extraction protocol used were probably
responsible for the high hit rate (0.53%) of lipolytic
active clones obtained. So far only two other works have
reported a hit rate of this magnitude. Recently, Liaw et

al. (2010) obtained a hit rate of 0.31% (12 positives) for
lipolytic clones with a metagenomic library constructed
from an activated sludge of a swine wastewater treatment facility. They attributed their high hit rate to the
sample source, which caused a natural enrichment in
lipolytic organisms. A comparable effect seems to have
occurred with the high-fat soil used in this study. Using
the prokaryotic DNA extraction protocol, Hårdeman
and Sjöling (2007) obtained a hit rate for lipolytic clones
of 1% from a metagenomic library of Baltic Sea sediment with more than 7000 fosmids. When the prokaryotic DNA extraction technique or the enrichment step
prior to DNA extraction are not applied, the hit rate of
lipolytic clones in metagenomic libraries is typically
lower, ranging from 0.001 to 0.081% [28].
The prokaryotic DNA extraction procedure circumvents two main problems. First, it is very difficult to
extract DNA of high molecular weight for fosmid cloning from a soil with high organic matter content by
direct lysis procedures [49]. Second, even though eukaryotic cells correspond to only 0.1% of the total number
of cells in environmental samples, they may contribute
about 90% of the total DNA due to their larger genome
size. This eukaryotic DNA is unlikely to be expressed
properly in E. coli but increases the library size [50].
In addition to the hit rate, the library size is a critical
factor for success in a metagenome project. Metagenomics libraries used have diverse sizes, in most cases
varying from few thousands to one million clones
[51-53]. In the current work, both the elevated hit rate
and the large size of the metagenomic library (approximately 500,000 clones) allowed the detection of 2,661
lipolytic clones, the largest number of lipolytic clones so
far reported in a metagenomic study. Moreover, the
three-stage screening strategy was able to discriminate
triolein-active clones among the tricaprylin- and tributyrin-active clones, enabling the selection of a true lipase
as well as the acquisition of lipolytic clone sublibraries
for further screenings against oils and fats of interest.
Few lipases with high activity against long-chain triglycerides such as vegetable oils or animal fat have been
found so far through the metagenomic approach. To the
best of our knowledge, among metagenome-derived
lipases, LipC12 has the highest specific activities against
long-chain triglycerides (1767 and 1722 U/mg for pig fat
and olive oil, respectively). In other metagenomic studies, EML1, a new cold-active lipase from a sediment
metagenome, had a preference for medium-chain triglycerides, with a specific activity against trilaurin (C12) of
203 U/mg [35]; the lipases RlipE1 and RlipE2, isolated
from a metagenomic library of cow rumen, had specific
activities of 346 and 232 U/mg, respectively, against
triolein (C18) [36]; and LipG, from a metagenomic
library of tidal flat sediments, had a specific activity

Page 9 of 15

against pNPP of 459 U/mg, while for triglycerides only
relative activities were presented, with the highest activity against triolein, followed by tricaprylin and tributyrin
[33]. Other metagenome-derived lipases showed hydrolysis halos in triolein or olive oil plate assays but the
specific activities against these substrates were not measured [32,34,37].
In fact, the specific activity of LipC12 is comparable to
that of the lipases of Rhizopus oryzae, Rhizomucor miehei and Thermomyces lanuginosus (formerly Humicola
lanuginosa), which showed activities against olive oil of
1000, 3300 and 2900 U/mg, respectively [54]. These are
industrially used lipases with well-known high activity
against long-chain triglycerides [4,12,55].

Conclusions
We obtained a high hit rate of lipolytic activity in our
metagenomic study by combining three strategies,
namely the use of fat-contaminated soil, the use of a
prokaryotic DNA enrichment step and the use of a
three-step screening strategy in which the last step
tested for true lipase activity. The lipase that we isolated,
LipC12, is a novel lipase. Although it was initially
selected solely on the basis of its high activity against
triolein, it has characteristics that make it suitable for
biotechnological applications such as activity and stability over a wide range of pH values, high activity and
high thermal stability at ambient temperatures and stability in water-miscible organic solvents and at high salt
concentrations. Moreover, production of recombinant
LipC12 is convenient due its high solubility, easy purification through affinity chromatography and chaperonefree folding. LipC12 is a promising candidate for
improvement of stability and activity by protein engineering, once the LipC12 three-dimensional structure is
determined, or by directed evolution.

enzymes and the protein molecular mass marker were
purchased from Fermentas (Glen Burnie, MD, USA).
The HiTrap Chelating HP column was purchased from
GE Healthcare (Uppsala, Sweden). The nitrophenyl ester
series, triacetin, tripropionin, tributyrin, trioctanoin, tridodecanoin, triolein, castor oil, BES buffer, (R)-glycidyl
butyrate, (S)-glycidyl butyrate, resorufin butyrate and pnitrophenol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO, USA). The natural oils for lipase analysis
were commercial products purchased from a supermarket. All other chemicals used for lipase analysis were of
analytical grade.
Sample collection and DNA extraction

Soil samples were collected from the banks of an anaerobic lagoon (GPS position, 24°56’11.11"S, 50°
7’27.06"W) of the wastewater treatment plant of a meat
packing and dairy industry located in the state of
Paraná, Brazil. The average soil temperature was 30°C
and soil samples up to 3 cm of soil depth were aseptically stored for 24 h at ambient temperature and subjected to DNA extraction by an indirect lysis method
[56], in which prokaryotic cells were separated from the
sediment by low-speed centrifugation before cell lysis.
Metagenomic library construction and screening for
lipolytic activity

Purified DNA samples were size-separated on a 0.7%
low melting point (LMP) agarose gel in TAE buffer at
20 V/cm. DNA bands from 20 to 40 kb were excised
from the gel and extracted by the phenol method [57].
A metagenomic DNA library was constructed using the
CopyControl Fosmid Library production kit, according
to the manufacturer’s protocol (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI, USA). For activity screening, the
transformed cells were plated onto modified Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates (5 g/L peptone, 3 g/L yeast extract,
13 g/L bacteriological agar, 10 g/L gum arabic) containing 1% (v/v) emulsified tributyrin as substrate. Cells
were grown at 37°C for four days and transformants
with clear halos around individual colonies were chosen
as possible lipase/esterase producing clones. The
selected clones were transferred to 96-well microtiter
plates with Terrific Broth and subjected to a second
screening for lipolytic activity on the modified LB agar
except that 1% (v/v) tricaprylin was used instead of tributyrin. Tricaprylin positive clones were transferred to
96-well microtiter plates and stored. True lipase producing clones were identified amongst the tricaprylin
active clones by screening on modified LB agar containing 1% (v/v) triolein. Three clones that showed the
strongest lipase activity (FosC12, FosE6 and FosH10)
were further analyzed.

Subcloning and identification of the lipase gene

Sublibraries of the FosC12, FosE6 and FosH10 fosmids
were constructed in pUC18 vector and subclones were
screened for lipolytic activity on modified LB agar medium with 1% (v/v) triolein. The inserts of active subclones were sequenced on an ABI 377 Automated
Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA) from both ends
using DYEnamic ET Dye Terminator Kit (GE Life
Sciences, USA). Sequence assembly and editing were
performed with the CodonCode Aligner software
(CodonCode Corporation, Dedham, MA, USA). The
open reading frames (ORFs) were identified with the
ORF Finder tool [58] and the amino acid sequences
were compared with the non-redundant sequence database deposited at the NCBI using BLAST [59]. Fosmids
FosC12, FosE6 and FosH10 had the same lipase gene.
Thus, further cloning steps were performed using the
FosC12 fosmid and the lipase protein sequence is hereafter denominated LipC12 (lipC12 gene).
Lipase sequence analysis and phylogenetic tree
construction

Prediction of transmembrane regions and signal peptide
sequence were performed using the TMHMM 2.0 [60]
and SignalP 3.0 servers [61], respectively. Protein solubility prediction was carried out with the system SOSUI
[62]. The ProtParam tool was used to calculate the theoretical parameters of the protein [63]. Multiple sequence
alignment was performed with the ClustalW algorithm
[64] in combination with Geneious software (Biomatters
Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand). Phylogenetic analysis was
carried out with the neighbor-joining method using
MEGA version 5. Bootstrapping (10,000 replicates) was
used to estimate the confidence levels of phylogenetic
reconstructions [65]. GeneDoc version 2.7 was used for
displaying and highlighting the multiple sequence
alignments.
Cloning of lipC12 gene

The forward primer LipC12.L (5’CAACGTCAAAGAGGTTATTC3’) and the reverse primer LipC12.R
(5’CGAGTGCTATCGTTCATTTA3’) were used in a
PCR reaction (FideliTaq PCR Master Mix, USB, USA)
for the amplification of a 966 bp fragment. The amplified gene was first cloned into the pCR 2.1 vector (TA
Cloning Kit, Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and recombinant plasmids
were transformed into E. coli DH10B competent cells by
electroporation. White colonies were picked, plasmids
were extracted [66] and their inserts were sequenced
with M13 forward and reverse primers to confirm the
absence of mutations in lipC12. Recombinant plasmid
was then digested with NdeI (cut at lipC12 translation

Glogauer et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10:54
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/10/1/54

start codon) and BamHI. The insert was ligated into the
pET28a(+) vector, which had been previously digested
with the same restriction enzymes and dephosphorylated
by SAP, yielding plasmid pET28a-lipC12, the insert of
which was end-sequenced with the T7 promoter and
terminator primers. Plasmid pET28a-lipC12 was then
transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells to express the
recombinant (His)6-tagged LipC12 lipase.
Overexpression and purification of recombinant LipC12
lipase

E. coli BL21(DE3) cells carrying the pET28a-lipC12 plasmid were grown in 200 mL of LB medium at 37°C until
an OD600 of 0.5 and induced by the addition of isopropyl-b-D thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The induced culture was incubated
for a further 16 h at 20°C before harvesting of the cells
by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 5 min) at 4°C. The cell
pellet was resuspended in 35 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM
Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 10
mM b-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25% (w/v)
Nonidet P-40) and disrupted by ultrasonication in an ice
bath (10 cycles of 60 s pulses, 90 W, with 30 s intervals),
using a SONICATOR® XL 2020 (Heat systems-Ultrasonics Inc., New Highway, Farmingdale, NY, USA). The
crude extract was then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30
min at 4°C to pellet the cell debris. The supernatant
containing the His-tagged protein was loaded onto a
HiTrap Chelating HP column (GE Healthcare, USA),
previously loaded with Ni2+ and equilibrated with lysis
buffer, using an ÄKTAbasic chromatography system
(GE Healthcare, USA). The column was washed with 5
volumes of the lysis buffer and further with 5 volumes
of elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM
NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol). The Histagged protein was eluted with an increasing gradient of
imidazole up to 500 mM in elution buffer. The elution
of protein was monitored at 280 nm, protein fractions
were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, pooled, dialyzed (50 mM
Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 50% (v/
v) glycerol) and stored at -24°C until use.
Protein content determination, electrophoresis and
zymogram analyses

Protein content was determined using the Pierce BCA
Protein Assay Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL,
USA) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Electrophoresis of protein samples was done with 12% (w/v)
SDS-PAGE [67] and the gel was stained with Coomassie
Brilliant Blue R-250 and destained with methanol/
acetic-acid/water (5/1/4 v/v/v). Densitometric analysis of
the stained SDS-PAGE gel was done using LabWorks
Image Acquisition and Analysis Software 4.0 (UVP BioImaging Systems, Upland, CA, USA). Lipolytic activity of

Page 11 of 15

bands on the SDS-PAGE gel was detected using tributyrin or tricaprylin as substrate [68].
MALDI-TOF/MS analysis

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)
time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectra (MS) were acquired
on a MALDI-TOF/TOF Autoflex II spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) in the reflector positive ion mode with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV,
delay time of 150 ns and acquisition mass range 8003200 Da. Spots were excised manually and in-gel
digested with sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, USA) as described elsewhere [69]. The
sample was desalted using a ZipTipC 18 pipette tip
(Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA) and eluted
directly onto the MALDI target plate using MALDI
matrix (saturated solution of a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA).
Mass profiles were identified by comparing the peptide
masses obtained with in silico digestion of the Histagged protein sequence using PeptideCutter and MSDigest tools [63].
Spectrophotometric determinations of lipase activity
using pNP substrates

Enzymatic activities were determined by following the
amount of p-nitrophenol released from p-nitrophenyl
ester at 410 nm [70] for at least 30 min at 30°C in a
TECAN Infinite Series M200 microplate spectrophotometer (TECAN, Salzburg, Austria). Unless otherwise
described, for the standard assay, the substrate solution
was made by mixing a stock solution of 20 mM of pnitrophenyl palmitate (pNPP) in acetonitrile/isopropanol (1/4 v/v) with an assay buffer containing Tris-HCl
pH 7.5, CaCl2 and Triton X-100, under agitation in a
water bath at 60°C, until the solution became transparent. Then 230 μL of the substrate solution was
pipetted into a 96-well microtiter plate and the reaction was initiated by automatic addition (with the
TECAN injector module) of 20 μL of the enzyme solution (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM CaCl2) to a final
concentration of 5 nM. The final volume of the reaction mixture (Tris-HCl 50 mM, pH 7.5, 1 mM CaCl2,
0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 nM enzyme, 1 mM pNPP,
4% (v/v) isopropanol, 1% (v/v) acetonitrile) was 250
μL. All experiments were performed in triplicate, the
extinction coefficients of p-nitrophenol were determined under each reaction condition and the effect of
nonenzymatic hydrolysis of substrates was subtracted.
One unit of lipase activity was defined as 1 μmol of pnitrophenol produced per minute. Linear regressions
to determine initial reaction velocities and standard
deviations of means were performed with Calc software from the OpenOffice.org package.

Substrate specificity for nitrophenyl esters was analyzed under standard conditions using p-nitrophenyl
acetate (C2:0), p-nitrophenyl butyrate (C4:0), p-nitrophenyl valerate (C5:0), p-nitrophenyl caproate (C6:0), pnitrophenyl decanoate (C10:0), p-nitrophenyl dodecanoate (C12:0), p-nitrophenyl myristate (C14:0) and p-nitrophenyl palmitate (C16:0).
The temperature giving maximum substrate conversion
over a 1 h reaction time was determined by incubating
the enzyme with p-nitrophenyl ester (2 nM enzyme, 10
mM p-nitrophenyl butyrate, MES 50 mM pH 6.0, 1 mM
CaCl2, 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100, 4% (v/v) isopropanol, 1%
(v/v) acetonitrile) in a reaction volume of 50 μL at various temperatures within the range of 10°C to 60°C. In
relation to the standard assay, p-nitrophenyl butyrate was
used instead of pNPP to minimize substrate solubility
variations with reaction temperature and the reaction pH
was decreased to minimize substrate autohydrolysis,
which occurs at higher temperatures. The reaction was
carried out in a 96-well PCR plate on a Thermal Cycler
(Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) running in gradient
mode. After the reaction time, the plate was immediately
chilled on ice and the enzymatic reaction was stopped by
the addition of 100 μL of 0.1 M HCl. Then 125 μL was
transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate, completed to
250 μL with deionized water and the amount of released
p-nitrophenol was measured at 348 nm instead of 410
nm: the absorption of p-nitrophenol decreases at 410 nm
as the pH decreases, due to changes in equilibrium
between p-nitrophenol and p-nitrophenoxide, while 348
nm is the pH-independent isosbestic wavelength of pnitrophenoxide and p-nitrophenol [71].
The effect of cations and anions on the enzymatic
activity of LipC12 was also investigated. For analyses
involving cations, the enzyme at 250 nM was previously
incubated with 1 mM EDTA/50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5
for 1 h in order to remove cations from the enzyme.
Then 20 μL of enzyme solution was added to each well
of a 96-well microtiter plate, followed by 25 μL of cation
solution and 205 μL of substrate solution (with 0.5 mM
of EDTA) giving a reaction mixture (Tris-HCl 50 mM
pH 7.5, 1 mM of a specific cation, 0.3% (v/v) Triton X100, 20 nM enzyme, 1 mM pNPP, 0.5 mM EDTA, 4%
(v/v) isopropanol, 1% (v/v) acetonitrile) that was monitored at 410 nm, as described above. The effect of
cations on the enzymatic activity of LipC12 without previous cation depletion was also tested. For analyses
involving anions, cation depletion with EDTA was not
performed and a standard assay was carried out except
that either 1 mM or 10 mM of a specific anion was
added (all anions were added in the form of sodium
salts).
Similarly, the effects of lipase inhibitors were investigated. Chelating agents such as ethylenediamine

Page 12 of 15

tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and ethylene glycol tetraacetic
acid (EGTA) and modifying reagents such as phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) were used. The effects on LipC12 activity
of commonly used detergents such as Tween 20, Tween
40, Tween 80, Triton X-100, Nonidet P-40 (NP40),
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), Sarkosyl NL (NLS) and
hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were
also investigated. The effect of gum arabic, commonly
used as an emulsion stabilizer, was checked. In these
cases, the activity measurements were done using the
standard assay, except that the chemicals listed above
were added to the wells before the addition of the substrate and enzyme solutions.
Thermostability was determined by measuring the
residual activity after incubating 250 nM of the enzyme
(50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM CaCl2) at various temperatures in the range of 0°C to 90°C for 1 h in 200 μL
PCR Eppendorf tubes with mineral oil on top to prevent
evaporation. The incubation was carried out using a
volume of 50 μL on the Thermal Cycler (Eppendorf,
Hamburg, Germany) running in gradient mode. After
the incubation time, the tubes were chilled on ice and
the residual activity was determined at 10 nM of enzyme
in the reaction mixture.
Stability in organic solvents was determined by measuring the residual activity after incubation of the
enzyme at 500 nM with 15% or 30% (v/v) organic solvents (200 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 mM CaCl2) at 4°C
for 48 h. In order to equalize the solvent concentration
before the residual activity measurement, the solvent
concentration of each solvent incubated at 15% (v/v)
was corrected to 0.3% (v/v) during dilution of the
enzyme (the enzyme was diluted 100-fold before performing the residual activity measurement).
Stability in high salt concentrations, up to 3.7 M, was
investigated by incubating LipC12 at 785 nM (1 mM
CaCl2, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5) for 24 h at 4°C. Several
NaCl and KCl concentrations were tested. All salt concentrations were equalized to 37 mM during the 100fold dilution of the enzyme prior to the residual activity
measurement.
The pH stability was tested after incubation of the
purified enzyme for 24 h at 4°C in different buffers. For
a pH range of 3.0 to 11.0, the buffers used were 50 mM
sodium acetate (pH 3.0 to 5.5), 50 mM MES (pH 5.5 to
7.0), 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0 to 7.5), and 50 mM glycine
(pH 7.5 to 11). The enzyme was diluted 100-fold in 50
mM HEPES pH 7.5 for the residual activity measurement under standard assay conditions.
Determination of lipase enantioselectivity was performed using the Quick E method [72-74]. Substrate
solutions were prepared using glycidyl butyrate enantiomers and resorufin butyrate was used as the reference

substrate. A buffer/indicator solution was prepared by
mixing 4-nitrophenol solution (1.2 mL of a 1.8 mM
solution in 1.0 mM BES containing 0.33 mM Triton X100, pH 7.2), BES buffer (3.3 mL of a 1.0 mM solution
containing 0.33 mM Triton X-100, pH 7.2), and acetonitrile (65 μL). Substrate solution (35 μL of a 150 mM glycidyl butyrate enantiomer in acetonitrile) and resorufin
ester solution (260 μL of 2.0 mM resorufin butyrate in
acetonitrile) were added dropwise with continuous vortexing to form a clear emulsion that was stable for at
least several hours. This solution was pipetted into a 96well polystyrene microplate (100 μL/well). Lipase solution (5 μL in 5 mM BES) was added to each well and
the microplate was placed in the microplate reader
(TECAN Infinite Series M200 microplate spectrophotometer, TECAN, Salzburg, Austria) and shaken for 10 s.
Then the decrease in absorbance at 404 nm and the
increase in absorbance at 574 nm were followed for 30
min at 25°C. Blanks without enzyme were carried out
for each substrate and data were collected in triplicate.
Reaction rates for the reference substrate and each
enantiomer were calculated using Eqs. (1) and (2),
respectively, using the initial linear parts of the curves of
absorbance versus time:
rateref (µmol/min) =

dA574 /dt
× V × 106
ε574 × l

(1)

rateenan (µmol/min) = −1.1(rateref )+
dA404 /dt
×
ε404 × l

[buffer]
+ 1 × V × 106
[indicator]

(2)

where dA574/dt is the absorbance increase (at 574 nm)
per minute, Δε574 is the difference in extinction coefficients at 574 nm for resorufin and resorufin butyrate
(15,100 M-1 cm-1), l is the path length (0.3064 cm for a
105 μl reaction volume), V is the reaction volume in
liters, dA404/dt is the absorbance decrease (at 404 nm)
per minute and Δε 404 is the difference in extinction
coefficients for the protonated and unprotonated forms
of the 4-nitrophenol (17,300 M-1 cm-1).
The enantioselectivity was calculated from two measurements (one for each glycidyl butyrate enantiomer)
as shown in Eq. (3):
Quick E (S/R) =

rateS
raterefR
×
raterefS
rateR

(3)

where rate S represents the rate of hydrolysis of the
(S)-glycidyl butyrate enantiomer and raterefS is the rate
of hydrolysis of the reference substrate (resorufin butyrate) in the presence of the (S)-enantiomer. Analogous
definitions apply for rateR and rate refR in terms of the
(R)-enantiomer.

Titrimetric determinations of lipase activity using
triacylglycerol substrates

The substrate emulsions consisted of triacylglycerol 67
mM, gum arabic 3% (w/v), CaCl2 2 mM, Tris-HCl 2.5
mM and NaCl 150 mM, dispersed in distilled water
[75]. The solution was emulsified with a handheld mixer
(400 watts, Royal Philips Electronics) at high speed,
initially for 10 min and then for an additional 2 min
immediately before use. The free fatty acids released
during the reaction were titrated automatically in a
Metrohm 718 STAT Titrino potentiometric titrator
(Metrohm, Herisau, Switzerland) with 0.05 M NaOH,
for 5 min. The reactions were done in a glass vessel
thermostated at 30°C containing 20 mL of substrate
emulsion and 6.68 μg of purified enzyme added in 200
μL of solution buffer (Tris-HCl 2.5 mM pH 8, CaCl2 5
mM). The titration point was set to pH 8.5. All measurements were performed in triplicate and chemical
hydrolysis of the substrate was subtracted. One unit (U)
of enzymatic activity was defined as the release of 1
μmol of fatty acid per minute.
The pH optimum for LipC12 was determined using
tributyrin as a substrate [40]. The substrate emulsion
and reaction conditions were the same as described
above except that the setpoint pH was set at different
values. Corrections were made for autohydrolysis and
for the partial dissociation of butanoic acid assuming a
pKa of 4.57.
