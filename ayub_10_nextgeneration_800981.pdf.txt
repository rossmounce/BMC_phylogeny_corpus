Next-generation sequencing and the era of
personal Y genomes

Next-generation sequencing technologies have produced
many ‘whole’ human genome sequences and the 1000
Genomes Project is poised to add two and a half thousand additional genomes. The 1000 Genomes Pilot 1
Project has sequenced Y chromosomes from 77 males
(27 CEU, 10 CHB, 16 JPT, 24 YRI) albeit at low (1x-2x)
sequence coverage, and identified a total of ~3000 variable sites of which 75% are novel. Although many sites
are missed, preliminary validation by Sanger di-deoxy
sequencing gave an initial estimate of a low (3.3%) false
positive rate. In addition, we have developed a resource
of Y-specific primer pairs that target single-copy regions
of the human Y chromosome. These have been used to
produce 5-7 kb overlapping fragments by long-PCR that
are subsequently pooled and sequenced.
This strategy was used to sequence, at high depth, 2-3
Mb of single-copy Y-specific DNA in a haplogroup A
individual. The primer pairs have also been distributed
to the wider community with the aim of re-sequencing
comparable targeted regions in a diverse group of Y
chromosomes. Using these primers, we have also established a tag indexing protocol that uses an 8-bp tag specific to each male, so that pooled samples from several
males can be sequenced in one lane of an Illumina Genome Analyzer II, and sequence reads can be assigned
back to each male sample using the tag. Using these
approaches, we aim to generate individual Y-chromosomal sequences with adequate coverage that can be
appropriately filtered to generate robust Y-SNP calls for
refinement of the Y phylogenetic tree and further investigation of lineages of particular interest.
