Functional divergence of the NIP III subgroup
proteins involved altered selective constraints
and positive selection
Qingpo Liu*, Zhujun Zhu*

Abstract
Background: Nod26-like intrinsic proteins (NIPs) that belong to the aquaporin superfamily are unique to plants.
According to homology modeling and phylogenetic analysis, the NIP subfamily can be further divided into three
subgroups with distinct biological functions (NIP I, NIP II, and NIP III). In some grasses, the NIP III subgroup proteins
(NIP2s) were demonstrated to be permeable to solutes with larger diameter, such as silicic acid and arsenous acids.
However, to date there is no data-mining or direct experimental evidences for the permeability of such larger
solutes for dicot NIP2s, although they exhibit similar three-dimensional structures as those in grasses. It is therefore
intriguing to investigate the molecular mechanisms that drive the evolution of plant NIP2s.
Results: The NIP III subgroup is more ancient with a divergence time that predates the monocot-dicot split. The
proliferation of NIP2 genes in modern grass species is primarily attributed to whole genome and segmental
chromosomal duplication events. The structure of NIP2 genes is relatively conserved, possessing five exons and
four introns. All NIP2s possess an ar/R filter consisting of G, S, G, and R, except for the cucumber CsNIP2;2, where a
small G in the H2 is substituted with the bulkier C residue. Our maximum likelihood analysis revealed that NIP2s,
especially the loop A (LA) region, have undergone strong selective pressure for adaptive evolution. The analysis at
the amino acid level provided strong statistical evidences for the functional divergence between monocot and
dicot NIP III subgroup proteins. In addition, several SDPs (Specificity Determining Positions) responsible for
functional specificity were predicted.
Conclusions: The present study provides the first evidences of functional divergence between dicot and monocot
NIP2s, and suggests that positive selection, as well as a radical shift of evolutionary rate at some critical amino acid
sites is the primary driver. These findings will expand our understanding to evolutionary mechanisms driving the
functional diversification of monocot and dicot NIP III subgroup proteins.

Background
NOD26-like intrinsic proteins (NIPs) are plant specific
integral membrane proteins, belonging to the aquaporin
water channel superfamily. NIPs can be traced back to
the early developmental stage of primitive land plants
[1], indicating an important role during their evolution.
Amongst plant aquaporins, only NIPs have the glycerol
transport activity [2]. It was reported that there are 9,
13, 9 and 6 NIP genes encoded in the Arabidopsis, rice,
sorghum, and Cucumis sativus genomes, respectively [1].

The divergence and proliferation of NIPs may be an
adaptive response to an ever-changing environment [3].
Recent experimental evidences suggest that NIPs could
perform a diverse range of functions, including a wider
range for selectivity [4,5]. It was demonstrated that two
constriction points within the pore, referred to as the conserved dual NPA motifs and the aromatic/arginine (ar/R)
selectivity filter, primarily determine the substrate selectivity of plant aquaporins [4]. However, it appears that the
ar/R filter, which consists of four amino acid residues
from helix H2, helix H5, and loop LE1 + LE2, plays a crucial role in determining the substrate selectivity of NIPs
[6]. Based on difference in the ar/R filter motif and on our
phylogenetic tree reconstruction, it is evident that NIPs

should be divided into three distinct subgroups [1,7]. The
properties of the four residues making up the ar/R filter
are remarkably different, leading to the significant variation of permeation ability for the proteins within each subgroup. In comparison to the NIP I and NIP II subgroups,
NIP III proteins possess the largest constriction size of the
pore (≥6Å), which allows larger solutes such as silicic acid
(diameter 4.38Å) to permeate [6,8].
With a few exceptions, the function of most of the NIP
III subgroup proteins remains unknown. Of plant aquaporins, rice genes OsNIP2;1 (Lsi1) and OsNIP2;2 (Lsi6),
and barley HvNIP2;1 (HvLsi1), which belong to the NIP
III subgroup and localize in the plasma membrane, were
demonstrated to function as a transporter of silicon
across the biomembrane [9-11], a compound that can
enhance the resistance of plants to biotic and abiotic
stress. Moreover, it was found that rice OsNIP2;1 could
be permeable to water, urea, boric acid, and silicic acid,
but not glycerol. However, competition experiments indicated that this gene is a highly specific transporter of
silicic acid [6]. When expressed in oocytes, both
OsNIP2;1 and OsNIP2;2 were shown to have transport
activity for arsenite but not arsenate [12,13], with the former gene having a greater role in the major pathway for
arsenite uptake [13]. In addition, the rice OsNIP2;1 was
found to be responsible, at least partly, for the permeability to methylated arsenic species MMA and DMA [14].
All three arsenous acids are slightly smaller than silicic
acid [13,14], which may explain the permeability of
OsNIP2;1. Given that arsenite and glycerol are structurally similar [12], it is surprising that rice OsNIP2;1 does
not transport glycerol [6,13], and suggests that other
structural features may be involved in the process of efficient substrate discrimination [6,12].
NIP genes generally exhibit a low expression level, and
often show a tissue- and/or cell type specific expression
pattern [1,15,16]. The rice gene OsNIP2;1 is specifically
expressed in roots, and the expression level can be transiently enhanced during the heading stage [10,17];
whereas OsNIP2;2 is expressed in both the shoots and
roots, and its expression level in roots is much weaker
than that of OsNIP2;1 [11]. The difference in expression
pattern is consistent with their distinct silicon transport
functions [10,11]. Moreover, it was observed that the
accumulation of silicon in different rice cultivars varies
extensively, which might result from the differences in
the expression of OsNIP2;1 and other silicon transporter
genes in rice roots [17]. The barley HvLsi1, like rice
OsNIP2;1, is specifically expressed in the basal root, and
a weak correlation between silicon uptake and the
expression level of HvLsi1 in eight tested cultivars was
observed [9]. Moshelion et al. [18] examined the expression pattern of 33 aquaporin genes using macro-array
hybridization, and found that ZmNIP2;1 is weakly

Page 2 of 12

expressed in maize suspension cultured cells. However,
the function of ZmNIP2;1 remains to be further characterized precisely. In addition, the expression of rice
OsNIP2;1 can be regulated by abiotic stresses. For
instance, OsNIP2;1 expression is down-regulated during
periods of dehydration and in response to the presence
of ABA [19], but is induced by salt stress [20].
Homology modeling suggests that NIP proteins share a
common general three-dimensional structure [7]. The
ar/R filter of Cicer arietinum CaNod26 and Cucurbita
pepo CpNod26 (defined as CaNIP2;1 and CpNIP2;1
respectively in this study) consists of Gly (H2), Ser (H5),
Gly (LE1) and Arg (LE2) [7], identical to those NIP III
proteins reported in grass species [6,7], and suggests that
they also function in silicon uptake and/or translocation
[7]. However, for NIP III proteins in dicot species there is
no any experimental evidence for the function in silicon
uptake and/or translocation, although previous research
revealed that the C. pepo CpNIP2;1, which is prominent in
leaf veins, could catalyze the transmembrane flow of urea
and water, but not glycerol [21]. Therefore, it is intriguing
to further investigate whether dicot NIP III genes can
transport larger solutes like silicic acid. Here we demonstrated shifts of selective constraint and positive selection
may have been involved in the evolution of the NIP III
proteins, which may correspond to functional differences
observed between dicot and monocot NIP III genes.

Results and discussion
Phylogenetic analysis of the NIP III subgroup proteins

The protein and CDS sequences of approximately 20
plant genomes, as well as the cDNA and genomic DNA
sequences of six other plant species (Eragrostis tef, Festuca pratensis, Elaeis oleifera, Musa acuminate, Zingiber
officinale, Curcuma longa) that belong to Poaceae, Arecaceae, Musaceae, and Zingiberaceae, respectively, were
searched. We found that there is at least one NIP2 gene
presenting in all examined plant species except for two
Arabidopsis spp. (Additional file 1). In monocotyledonous plants, there are two copies of NIP2 encoded
within each grass species, except for maize, where three
NIP III proteins were characterized [22]; while only one
NIP2 gene (or fragment) was identified in Elaeis oleifera,
Musa acuminate, Zingiber officinale and Curcuma
longa. However, in the most tested dicotyledonous
plants, besides G. max and cucumber, only a single copy
of NIP2 gene was identified. In addition, a homologous
NIP2-like protein was found in the licophyte Selaginella
moellendorffii and the gymnosperm species Pinus taeda
and Picea sitchensis. These results imply that NIP2
genes are relatively important for grasses.
In total, 32 NIP III subgroup sequences were used to
reconstruct the phylogenetic trees, where the NIP2-like
homologs in S. moellendorffii, P. taeda and P. sitchensis

were used as outgroup sequences to root the trees. It
was observed that the ME tree and NJ tree showed the
similar topology (Figure 1 and Additional file 2), where
two distinct clades were clearly presented: the monocotand dicot-specific clades (Figure 1), which indicated that
the earliest proliferation of NIP2 genes in angiosperms
occurred after the monocot-dicot split approximately
200 million years ago (Mya) [23].
In the monocot-specific clade, two subclades, based on
the support of bootstrap values (91 and 99), were

further presented: the NIP2;1 and NIP2;2 subclades
(Figure 1). Within each subclade, the orthologous NIP2
genes derived from rice, maize, sorghum, barley, wheat,
switchgrass, and B. distachyon were tightly clustered
together, a result suggesting that the proliferation and
diversification of NIP2s in Poaceae occurred before the
divergence of grasses. Since previous studies revealed
that the modern grasses diverged from a common
grass ancestor [24], and a whole genome duplication
(WGD) event was estimated to have occurred about 70

Liu and Zhu BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:256

Mya [25,26], we reason that the duplication of NIP2
genes in grasses may result from the corresponding
WGD. To validate this, we analyzed the syntenic relationship between the chromosomes where the two NIP2
genes are located. We observed that three gene pairs
including SbNIP2;1/SbNIP2;2, BdNIP2;1/BdNIP2;2 (see
Additional file 3) and OsNIP2;1/OsNIP2;2 are located
into chromosomal regions that were supposed to have
undergone large-scale segmental duplications [1,27]. In
maize, ZmNIP2;2 and ZmNIP2;3, sharing an identity of
93.3% and 91.9% at the protein and DNA sequence level
respectively, are closely phylogenetic related (Figure 1),
although they are located in different chromosomes (6
and 9). Therefore, the production of ZmNIP2;2 and
ZmNIP2;3 was probably through the recent WGD event
occurred in maize [26,28] after its divergence with sorghum from a common ancestor ~12 Mya [29].
In dicotyledonous plants, we found no evidence for the
presence of NIP III genes in Arabidopsis thaliana and
Arabidopsis lyrata. However, a NIP III protein CpaNIP2;1 was identified in Carica papaya, a species sharing
a common ancestor with A. thaliana ~72 Mya [23].
Thus, it is parsimonious to infer that the NIP III gene in
Arabidopsis spp. were probably lost after their speciation
from C. papaya. In addition, we observed that the four
NIP III genes derived from three legumes (C. arietinum,
M. truncatula, and G. max) were clustered together and
presented as a Fabaceae-specific clade (Figure 1). The
D 4DTv value of soybean GmNIP2 genes is very small
(0.087), indicative of their recent duplication. Since the
soybean (G. max) genome has undergone two rounds of
large-scale genome and/or segmental duplication at
about 14 and 42 Mya, respectively [30,31], it is likely that
the two GmNIP2s were produced via the recent instead
of the ancient large-scale duplication event. Similarly, the
three Cucurbitaceae NIP2 genes constituted a lineagespecific clade, where two NIP2s (CsNIP2;1 and CsNIP2;2)
were derived from Cucumis sativus. From the phylogenteic tree (Figure 1), it can be inferred that the duplication
of CsNIP2;1 and CsNIP2;2 possibly predated the speciation time of cucumber and zucchini. Analysis of the
cucumber genome sequence successfully identified an
ancient WGD, but did not reveal recent duplications
[32]. Using a global clock model implemented in PAML
[33], we estimated the divergence time of the two
CsNIP2s at ~67.7 Mya; their D4DTv value is much larger
(0.441) (Table 1), suggestive of their ancient evolutionary
past. Interestingly, only one NIP2 gene (PtNIP2;1) was
identified in the poplar genome, although it has experienced two rounds of WGD [34].
Sequence characteristic analysis

In grasses, the orthologous NIP III subgroup proteins
are significantly homologous to each other (Figure 1).

Page 4 of 12

The average identity of sequences for the NIP2;1 and
NIP2;2 subclade proteins is 85.9% and 87.5% respectively, indicating that the NIP2 orthologs within each
subclade can perform the same or similar functions. In
agreement with this postulation, barley HvNIP2;1
(HvLsi1), like rice OsNIP2;1 (OsLsi1), was demonstrated
to function in mediating the influx of silicic acid in
roots [9,10]. In addition, we calculated the D4DTv values
for the paralogous genes in grasses, and found that with
one exception (ZmNIP2;2/ZmNIP2;3 with a D4DTv value
0.128), other paralogous gene pairs are highly diverged,
having a D 4DTv value not less than 0.26 (Table 1).
Therefore, the sequence variation should be partly
responsible for their functional diversification, as indicated by the functional studies of OsNIP2;1 and
OsNIP2;2 [10,11,13].
In contrast to the high similarity in grasses, large
sequence variation was observed among dicot NIP2s
that share an average identity of 61.6%. In addition, we
found that the overall average identity between monocot
and dicot NIP2s is decreased up to 60.4%. Nonetheless,
both monocot and dicot NIP2s show similar gene structures, possessing five exons and four introns (Additional
file 4). Although the introns vary extensively in length,
three exons (from 2 to 4) are remarkablely conserved in
tested plants (see Additional file 4), suggesting that
strong functional constraints should impose on the
corresponding exonic regions. In the two soybean
GmNIP2s, both the exons and introns are slightly different in length, supporting of their recent expansion.
However, substantial variation is found in the intron
lengths, especially in the second and fourth introns for
the ZmNIP2;2/ZmNIP2;3 gene pair, implying that their
diversification may be ongoing. The similar cases were
also observed in cucumber (CsNIP2;1/CsNIP2;2) and
other paralogous gene pairs in grasses.
As reported, the dual conserved NPA motifs and ar/R
filter play determinant roles for the selectivity of aquaporin proteins [35]. The ar/R filter is located in the narrowest region on the extra-membrane mouth of the
pore, which is approximately 8Å above the NPA region
[7]. We observed that the four residues making up the
ar/R filter are G, S, G, and R in tested proteins, which is
consistent with the typical feature of NIP III proteins,
except for CsNIP2;2, where the first residue in the H2 is
C instead of G (Figure 2; [1]). We cloned and resequenced the CsNIP2;2 gene, and confirmed the replacement of G with C. As the composition of ar/R filter
defines the pore size, pore hydrophobicity and hydrogen
bonding between pore and substrate [36], the substitution of the tiny Gly (G) residue with the bulkier Cys (C)
may give rise to a much narrower aperture than other
NIP III proteins (Additional file 5). Therefore, functional
analysis is urgently needed to further investigate why the

cucumber genome has evolved to two NIP III proteins,
but one of them has possibly lost its ability for permeating larger solutes, such as silicic acid. As for the NPA
motifs, we found that the first NPA motif is markedly
conserved, whereas the second one is slightly variant,
with the substitution by NPV in CsNIP2;1 and
CpNIP2;1 (Figure 2). NIP proteins often have unorthodox NPA motifs [1], which are different from other
MIPs. Furthermore, mutations in the NPA motifs do
not change the selectivity of NIP proteins [37], it thus
seems that the NPA motif is not a crucial factor in
determining the substrate selectivity for NIPs [6,8].
However, whether the NPA motifs play critical roles in
NIP III proteins remains to be further examined, since
the NPA motifs are highly conserved in NIP III proteins,
only with the exceptions of CsNIP2;1 and CpNIP2;1.
Positive selection in the NIP2 gene sequences

The CODEML program implemented in the PAML v4.4
software package [33] was utilized to test the hypothesis
of positive selection in the NIP III subgroup genes. The
estimation of positive selection was based on the tree
topology shown in Figure 1, where only full length
sequences were included into analysis. To test whether
there are variable ω ratios at amino acid sites, two pairs
of models (M0/M3, and M7/M8) were selected and
compared. In the model M0, a single ω is assumed for
all sites in the alignment. Under this model, the estimated ω value is 0.197 for NIP2s with the log-likelihood
score ℓ = -13752.4. Compared to other models, M0
shows a worse fit for the data because of its much lower
log-likelihood value than all other models (Table 2), and
thereby ruling out the possibility that all sites in the
alignment have the same ω ratio. In contrast, the selection models (M3 and M8) fit the data significantly better
than those that do not permit positive selection (M0
and M7) (Table 2), indicating that the NIP2 genes
should be under adaptive evolution where some sites
might undergo amino acid substitutions with high rate.
The comparison of M3 vs M0 reveals that ω is not
uniformly distributed along the NIP2 coding DNA
sequences, and about 0.97% codon sites may be under

Page 6 of 12

the influence of positive selection (ω = 1.85). Similarly,
compared with M7 model, the M8 model suggests that
~1.72% of codons fall in a category with estimated ω
value 1.54, a result indicative of strong positive selection.
Based on the Bayesian posterior probabilities, two and
5 codon site candidates for positive selection were identified for the M3 and M8 models respectively, of which
the posterior probabilities of sites 28 and 77 are >0.95
in both analyses (Table 2). In the M8 model, the posterior probabilities of three site candidates (30P, 38A, and
245M) are all less than 0.7, and thereby excluded from
further analysis. Furthermore, we observed that sites 28
and 77 are located in exons 1 and 2, respectively. After
projecting the two sites onto the simulated three-dimensional structures, we clearly observed that the first site
(28T) is located in the N-terminus, while the other site
(77S) in the periplasmic LA (loop A) (Figures 2 and 3).
Using a variety of codon site models, we demonstrated
the influence of positive selection in the evolution of
NIP III subgroup genes (Table 2). Compared with the
helix regions, the N- and C-terminus are highly divergent in NIP2 proteins (see Additional file 6). Nevertheless, it was found that plant aquaporins were regulated
by phosphorylation within the cytosolic termini and
loop regions [35,38]. We used the NetPhos2.0 Server
[39] to predict any possible serine and threonine phosphorylation sites in NIP2 proteins, and indeed found
many predicted candidates in the corresponding regions
(Additional file 7). These results suggest that the
N-terminus and loop regions are functionally important,
although they are not conserved as much as the helix
regions. The site 77 is located in the loop between helix
H1 and H2 (LA). In rice OsNIP2;1, the residue at the
corresponding site is Ser (S), which was predicted to be
a Serine phosphorylation site with high possibility (score
= 0.89; Additional file 7); whereas in other NIP2s, the
site is occupied by variant amino acids with different
physiochemical properties (Figure 2). Therefore, positive
selection in these regions may act as one major determinant in driving the functional divergence of NIP2s.
To test whether variable ω ratios are present among
lineages, we performed the likelihood ratio test (LRT) to

compare the two extreme models: the one-ratio model
that assumes a unique rate ratio for all branches, and
the free-ratio model that assumes an independent ω
ratio for each branch [33]. The log-likelihood value
under the one-ratio model is -11945.3, while the value is
-11796.9 for the free-ratio model. Twice the log likelihood differences, 2Δℓ = 296.8, is strongly statistically
significant (p < 0.01), revealing a heterogeneous selective
pressures among lineages. We further observed that
some branches of the NIP III gene phylogeny include
several internal branches having ω >1 (Figure 1), showing strong evidence for adaptive evolution.
In a gene family, the fate of new genes produced by
duplication would either evolve a new function under
positive selection, or be lost during evolution [40]. As
reported, plants have evolved more NIP proteins with
multi-functions [1,16,22]. We revealed that positive
selection was involved in the functional diversification
of NIP subfamily genes [1], as well as in the evolution of
NIP III subgroup genes (Figures 1 and 2, and Table 2).

The grasses encoded two or three NIP2 genes, where
the NIP2;2 gene has evolved new functions differentiating from that of NIP2;1s, which may represent an evolutionary advantage for grasses to uptake and translocate
silicon efficiently.
Functional divergence analysis of NIP2 proteins

The Gu (1999; 2006) methods [41,42] implemented in
DIVERGE2 [42] were used to evaluate Type-I (shifted
evolutionary rate) and Type-II (altered amino acid physiochemical property) functional divergence between
gene clusters of interests in the NIP III subgroup. The
advantage of these methods is that they use amino acid
sequences, and thereby is not sensitive to saturation of
synonymous sites [41,42].
Based on the distinct expression patterns and functions of OsNIP2;1 and OsNIP2;2 [10,11,13], we supposed that functional divergence in NIP2s should have
occurred after gene duplication in grasses. Unexpectedly,
we found no statistical evidence for Type-I functional

was insignificant (θI = 0.086 ± 0.145; LRT = 0.44; p >
0.05). However, when the posterior probability (Qk) of
divergence was determined for each site by DIVERGE2
[42], 7 sites with high probability (0.9 > Qk > 0.8) were
identified to be Type-II functional divergence related
(Additional file 8), indicative of a radical shift of amino
acid properties [42]. It appears that site-specific changes
of amino acid physiochemical properties may act as one
of the major evolutionary powers in driving the functional divergence of NIP2 proteins after their duplication
in grasses. Of the seven sites identified, 5 of them are
located in helixes and two in loop regions (LB and LE)
(Additional file 8). Further, we observed that although
the three sites located in helix H2 (V/T), H5 (A/P), and
LE (G/A) are physically close to the four residues of the
ar/R filter (G, S, G, and R) in the amino acid sequences,
only G/A in LE is predicted to spatially interact with R
in LE2. In addition, we found that the two residues in
LB (A/S) and LE (G/A) are not only physically adjacent
to the dual NPAs, but spatially interact with the third
residue (A) in the NPA motifs. LB and LE are functional
loops that participate in the formation of the aqueous
pore [35], implying that the A/S and G/A residues
should be structurally important. Moreover, a contact
between LE (G/A) and helix H3 (S/A) was also
observed. Therefore, the radical change of physiochemical property of the 7 sites may be the primary contributor to the functional divergence of NIP2s in grasses.
We further employed the DIVERGE2 to assess the
coefficients of Type-I and Type-II functional divergence
(θI and θII) between monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous NIP2s. We found that the null hypothesis (no
functional divergence) can be strongly rejected, because
the θI value is statistically significant (θI = 0.145 ± 0.041;
LRT = 12.6; p < 0.01). This indicates that shifted selective constraints must strongly operate on some amino
acid sites in monocot and dicot NIP2s, and thereby
leading to a lineage-specific functional evolution after
their divergence from an ancient common ancestor.
Furthermore, two critical amino acid sites (CAASs) were
predicted to be highly Type-I functional divergence
related (Qk > 0.9), where one site is located in LA, and
the other in the helix H4 (Figures 2 and 3). The CAAS
in LA (76L) is proximal to the identified positively
selected site 77 S. Using InterMap3 D [43], the two sites
are predicted to spatially contact with each other, and
have probably coevolved during evolution. In dicot
NIP2s, the CAAS in H4 is invariant Val (V), whereas it
is substituted with Ile (I) in some monocot NIP2s.
Nevertheless, no obviously statistical evidence for the
Type-II functional divergence was found (θII = -0.030 ±
0.096; p > 0.05). Together, these observations indicated

Page 8 of 12

that amino acid site-specific shifts of evolutionary rate
and changes of amino acid property should not uniformly act on the NIP2s after the split of monocots and
dicots.
Determination of functional specificity positions among
orthologous NIP2 proteins

Many protein families, such as the aquaporin superfamily, contain homologous proteins that have a common
biological function but with different specific substrates
and interactive molecules [44]. It is thus necessary to
identify residues that are significantly responsible for the
functional specificity, which may be useful in biological
studies. To this end, we used the SDPpred [44] server to
predict any possible Specificity Determining Positions
(SDPs) that may determine the functional specificity of
orthologous NIP2 proteins after the monocot-dicot split.
As shown in Table 3 and Figure 3, 5 SDPs were identified to be highly relevant to functional specificity.
Besides, we also observed that 3 out of the five SDPs are
located in the N-terminus, and the other two SDPs lie
on helix H3 (Figure 3 and Additional file 6).
In addition, we noticed that when using OsNIP2;1 as
the reference sequence, the residue at the site 84 was
invariant Gln (Q) in monocots including Musa acuminate and Elaeis oleifera, except for the Zingiber officinale ZoNIP2, where the corresponding site was
occupied by Ala (72A) (Additional files 1 and 6).
Whether the substitution of Q with A in ZoNIP2 is
sequencing or assembling error is unknown. However, if
the residue 72A in ZoNIP2 was replaced by G, this site
was also predicted to be a SDP with high confidence
(p value = 0.000; Table 3). Moreover, it was found that
the residue 84Q lies on the channel side (Additional file
9), and exhibits an interaction with the first residue of
the ar/R filter in H2. This suggests that the site 84Q may
be involved in the formation of a functional pore,
although the ar/R residues are identical in rice OsNIP2;1
and cucumber CsNIP2;1 (Figure 2 and Additional file 5).
If it was true, the Z. officinale ZoNIP2 gene, like dicots,
may perform a dissimilar function from other monocots.
Notably, we found that the predicted SDPs for the
NIP III subgroup are mainly distributed in two spatial
regions. As discussed above, the site 84Q was postulated
to be involved in the formation of the channel (Additional file 9). By contrast, most of other SDPs lie on the
surface of the protein and likely participate in establishing the tetrameric structure.

Conclusions
The current NIP III subgroup proteins were originated
and diverged from an ancient common ancestor that
emerged before the divergence of monocots and dicots.
Subsequently, monocot- and dicot-specific expansion of

NIP2 genes occurred. Plant NIP2s show relatively conserved gene structures, each containing five exons and
four introns. With only one exception (CsNIP2;2), the
ar/R filter of NIP2 proteins consists of G, S, G, and R.
All tested grasses encoded at least two NIP2 proteins
in their genomes. These paralogous NIP2s were probably produced via the whole genome duplication
(WGD) or segmental chromosomal duplication event
occurred in the common ancestor of modern grasses.
The proliferation and diversification of NIP2s in grasses
may be, at least partially, responsible for their highly
efficient influx of silicon in roots and then transporting
them out of xylem. By contrast, most of tested dicot
plants have only one NIP2 gene. Due to the small constriction size of the pore, CsNIP2;2 might be unable to
transport silicon, although the cucumber genome
encoded two NIP2 genes. In particular, Arabidopsis spp.
should have lost their NIP III subgroup genes during
evolution.
The NIP III subgroup genes have experienced strong
positive selection and diverged in function between
monocots and dicots. Several SDPs were identified to be
responsible for the determination of functional specificity of monocot and dicot NIP2 proteins. These findings
provide deeper insights into understanding the evolutionary mechanisms of NIP III subgroup proteins and
their functional diversification.

Methods
Sequence data

The rice (OsNIP2;1 and OsNIP2;2), sorghum (SbNIP2;1
and SbNIP2;2), maize (ZmNIP2;1, ZmNIP2;2 and
ZmNIP2;3), barley HvLsi1 (HvNIP2;1), C. arietinum
CaNIP2;1 and C. pepo CpNIP2;1 proteins that belong to
the NIP III subgroup were collected according to the
published literatures [1,7,9-11,22]. The Ricinus communis RcNIP2;1 (AN: EEF27965) was identified on the
basis of a BLASTP search against the nr database with e
value 0.01 in National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). These proteins were used as query to
search against the amino acid and DNA sequences of

the Brachypodium distachyon, Triticum aestivum, Hordeum vulgare, Vitis vinifera, Carica papaya, Medicago
truncatula, Glycine max, Lycopersicon esculentum, Populus trichocarpa, Cucumis sativus, Panicum virgatum,
Mimulus guttatus, Prunus persica, and Manihot esculenta genomes using BLASTP and TBLASTN programs,
respectively. In addition, an exhaustive search against
the cDNA and/or genomic DNA sequences of the genomes Eragrostis tef, Festuca pratensis, Elaeis oleifera,
Musa acuminate, Zingiber officinale, Curcuma longa,
Picea sitchensis, and Selaginella moellendorffii were performed also using BLASTN and TBLASTN programs,
respectively. Programs InterProScan [45] and ConPred
II [46] were utilized to detect conserved domains and
predict the putative transmembrane regions (TMs),
respectively. FgeneSH http://linux1.softberry.com/ was
employed to predict the gene structures of candidates
identified.
Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic
tree reconstruction

The NIP III subgroup protein sequences were aligned
using the program L-INS-i implemented in MAFFT v6.6
[47], with the parameters: Scoring matrix for amino acid
sequences, BLOSUM62; Gap opening penalty, 2.0; and
Gap extension penalty, 0.2. The resulting protein alignment was subsequently employed to generate the
codon-alignment of corresponding coding DNA
sequences using a custom PERL script. In the codonbased alignment, the codon sites at which most
sequences have data except for one or two sequences
were kept while sites at which all sequences except for
one or two have alignment gaps were removed. The
phylogenetic trees were reconstructed with MEGA v4.0
[48] using the Minimum Evolution (ME) and Neighborjoining (NJ) methods with the parameters of pairwise
deletion of gaps/missing data and the p-distance substitution model where only the transversions were taken
into account. The reliability of interior branches was
assessed with 1000 bootstrap resamplings. Phylogenetic
trees were displayed using MEGA v4.0 [48].

Tests of positive selection

We employed the CODEML program implemented in
the PAML v4.4 software package [33] to test the hypothesis of positive selection in the NIP III subgroup genes.
In the analysis, two pairs of models were contrasted to
test for heterogeneous selective pressures at codon sites.
First, models M0 (one ratio) and M3 (discrete) were
compared, using a test for heterogeneity between codon
sites in the dN/dS ratio value, ω. The second comparison
was M7 (beta) vs M8 (beta+ω >1); this is the most stringent test of positive selection [49]. M0 and M7 belong to
null models that do not allow for any codons with ω >1.
In such comparisons, positive selection is indicated if the
models that allow for selection (M3 and M8) are significantly better than the null model (no selection) in the
likelihood ratio test (LRT). When the LRT suggests positive selection, the Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) method
was used to calculate the posterior probabilities that each
codon is from the site class of positive selection under
models M3 and M8 [50].
To test for heterogeneous selective pressures among
lineages [33], models of variable ω ratios among lineages
were fitted by maximum likelihood (ML) to the NIP III
subgroup sequence alignment. The ratio of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous for each branch under two models
(one-ratio and free-ratio for branches) was calculated, and
the two models were compared using the LRT test to see
whether the ω ratios are different among lineages. Accordingly, positive selection is indicated if the free-ratio model
that allows for selection is significantly better than the
one-ratio model (no selection) in the LRT analysis.
Estimation of functional divergence

The software DIVERGE2 [42] was employed to detect
functional divergence between clusters of interests in the
plant NIP III subgroup. The coefficients of Type-I and
Type-II functional divergence (θI and θII) between any
two interesting clusters were calculated. If θI or θII is significantly >0, it means site-specific altered selective constraints or a radical shift of amino acid physiochemical
property after gene duplication and/or speciation [41,42].
Moreover, a site-specific profile based on the posterior
probability (Qk) was used to predict critical amino acid
residues that were responsible for functional divergence.
In this analysis, large Qk indicates a high possibility that
the functional constraint (or the evolutionary rate) and/
or the radical change of amino acid property of a site is
different between two clusters [41,42].
Analysis of specificity determining positions

The SDPpred [44] was utilized to identify the specificity
determining positions (SDPs) that determined differences
in the functional specificity of homologous proteins.
Based on a given multiple alignment, SDPpred computes

Page 10 of 12

Z-score for each alignment column. The higher Z-score,
the more likely the position is a true specificity determinant. The Bernoulli estimator was incorporated into
SDPpred to automatically produce a recognition cutoff
(B-cutoff) to evaluate the significance of the Z-scores in
order to assess whether the observed Z-score is sufficiently high to indicate an SDP. Positions scoring higher
than this cutoff are predicted to determine the specificity.
Homology molecular modeling

The homology models of NIP III subgroup proteins
were generated with HHpred [51] using the method of
HMM-HMM comparison of the queried protein and the
templates deposited in the PDB database. The generated
models were prepared and viewed with UCSF Chimera
[52], and the critical amino acid residues identified were
mapped onto the corresponding structures accordingly.
4DTv calculation

4DTv distance (D4DTv) that stands for fourfold synonymous third-codon transversion was calculated to assess
the genetic distances between paralogous pairs. In such
analysis, the paralogous proteins for each species were
pairwise aligned using MAFFT v6.6 [47], and subsequently the corresponding codon-alignment was created
according to the resulting protein alignment using a
custom PERL script. Based on these alignments, we
firstly identified the conserved fourfold degenerate
amino acids. And then the corresponding codons were
extracted from the codon-alignment and used to calculate the 4DTv distance between each aligning pair.
D4DTv ranges from 0 for recently duplicated peptides, to
~0.5 for paralogs with an ancient evolutionary past.
