Abstract
Background: An important goal of comparative genomics is the identification of functional
elements through conservation analysis. Phylo-HMM was recently introduced to detect conserved
elements based on multiple genome alignments, but the method has not been rigorously evaluated.
Results: We report here a simulation study to investigate the power of phylo-HMM. We show
that the power of the phylo-HMM approach depends on many factors, the most important being
the number of species-specific genomes used and evolutionary distances between pairs of species.
This finding is consistent with results reported by other groups for simpler comparative genomics
models. In addition, the conservation ratio of conserved elements and the expected length of the
conserved elements are also major factors. In contrast, the influence of the topology and the
nucleotide substitution model are relatively minor factors.
Conclusion: Our results provide for general guidelines on how to select the number of genomes
and their evolutionary distance in comparative genomics studies, as well as the level of power we
can expect under different parameter settings.

Background
One of the most fundamental problems of molecular
biology is to annotate all functional elements in the
genome. Because of evolutionary pressure, many of the
functional elements are believed to be located within
regions that evolve more slowly than the overall genome
[1,2]. Regions that evolve more slowly are called evolutionarily conserved elements. Conservation analysis by
comparing genomes of related species is a powerful
approach for identifying functional elements like protein/
RNA coding regions and transcriptional regulatory elements [3-8].

In comparative genomics, one often starts with an alignment of multiple orthologous sequences from several species. The power of a conservation analysis is usually
measured by its sensitivity and specificity of detecting
conserved elements from given alignments. Several papers
have been published recently dealing with the power evaluation of phylogenetic models in comparative genomics
studies [9,10]. Both Eddy [9] and McAuliffe et al. [10]
evaluated the power of such studies assuming a symmetric
star topology and the Jukes-Cantor nucleotide substitution model, whose simple structure makes it possible to
evaluate the power of the method analytically. McAuliffe
et al. considered the hypothesis testing problem for the

conservation of a single nucleotide site, whereas Eddy
considered the classification problem for whether a whole
DNA block is conserved or not. Both papers reported the
theoretical power mainly as a function of the number of
comparative genomes and the branch length from the
center of the star topology to each species. However, the
approaches they employed are not able to accommodate
the substitution rate variation and correlations among
nearby nucleotides along a genomic sequence. More realistic models are needed to account for the spatial rate variation and correlation in order to more accurately reflect
the nature of real data [11]. Various models have been
proposed for this task, including the hidden Markov
model [12,13], Ising chains [14,15] and Markov random
fields [16,17]. In particular, Felsenstein and Churchill
[13] used HMMs to model the substitution rate correlation along the genome. Since then, this model has been
adapted to many evolution related problems [7,18-20].
In this paper we evaluate the power of the phylogenetic
hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM), which models the
substitution rate variation using an HMM. As introduced
collectively in ref. [7,12,13] to improve phylogenetic
modeling, Phylo-HMM is a generative probability model
for aligned multiple orthologous sequences. It models the
molecular evolution in both the space dimension along
the genome and the time dimension along branches of
the phylogenetic tree. Along the genome of the common
ancestor, an HMM is used to describe the change from one
site to the next. Along each branch of the phylogenetic
tree, a continuous-time Markov process is used to model
the evolutionary process. Siepel et al. [7] implemented a
two-state phylo-HMM to perform a genome-wide detection of evolutionarily conserved elements. They showed
that this model can yield biologically meaningful results,
but did not evaluate the statistical power of the method.
In their study, the transition matrix of the HMM in the
phylo-HMM model is assumed to be known and
unchanged along the genome. This is equivalent to
assuming that the expected length and coverage (defined
as the percentage) of conserved elements are known and
that the conservation ratio is homogeneous along the
genome, which is unrealistic [21].
The goal of this paper is to systematically assess the ability
(or power) of the phylo-HMM to identify conserved
genomic regions. Because this model is too complex for a
theoretical analysis and because the availability of real
data with experimentally verified conserved elements is
still very limited, we adopt a simulation approach. Given
that different regions along the genome vary in terms of
their neutral substitution rates, the expected lengths and
coverage of the conserved elements [21], we used
sequence data from promoter regions of four selected species (human, mouse, rat, and dog) to first estimate the set

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/374

of key parameters of the phylo-HMM. We call this set of
estimated parameter values the baseline. We simulated
sequences by varying one or a subset of parameters
around the baseline. Using these simulated sequences, we
explore several fundamental questions in comparative
genomics with respect to this model, including 1) does
the topology of the phylogenetic tree critically impact statistical power?, 2) is the accuracy of the predictions significantly reduced if we simplify the nucleotide substitution
model?, 3) is it always beneficial to select more distantly
related species for this analysis, thereby increasing the
branch lengths of the phylogenetic tree?, 4) how many
comparative genomes do we need in order to detect conserved elements of a certain length with satisfactory
power?, and 5) is spatial variation of the conservation
ratio important? Assuming that the underlying phyloHMM model is a reasonable approximation of reality, our
results reveal a number of insights. First, we demonstrate
that the most important factors of a comparative genomics analysis appear to include the number of genomes
used and the evolutionary distance between pairs of species, consistent with results for simpler models reported
by others. Further, we show that the conservation ratio of
conserved elements and the expected length of the conserved elements are also major factors. Therefore, our
results show that it is important to accurately characterize
the inter-species (spatial) variation in the phylo-HMM
model. In contrast, the influence of the topology and the
nucleotide substitution model are relatively minor.

Methods
Phylo-HMM model
A main objective of the conservation analysis is to classify
each nucleotide position of the target genome as either
evolutionarily conserved or nonconserved based on a
comparison with genome sequences of some other chosen species. This task is often achieved by first aligning the
genomes under consideration and then using a computational strategy for site classification. Here we focus on the
second task. Following the description of the two-state
phylo-HMM model (Figure 1) given by Siepel et al. [7],
the alignment generating mechanism is modeled as a twostep procedure. First, a common ancestral DNA sequence
of all contemporary species under consideration is generated from a two-state HMM, with the hidden states being
conserved or nonconserved sites. Second, the phylogenetic model assumes that each nucleotide in the ancestral
DNA evolved independently, conditional on their hidden
states, to the contemporary nucleotides along all branches
of the phylogenetic tree. The two parameters, (µ, ν), for
the two-state HMM are derived from the data, and then reparameterized as (P, L), which have a more intuitive
explanation, with L = 1/µ representing the expected length
of a conserved element (i.e., a segment of contiguous conserved sites), and P = ν/(µ + ν) representing the expected

substitution rate is proportional to the frequency of the
target nucleotide. HKY [27] is a more realistic rate matrix
because it accounts for non-uniform base composition
and transition/transversion rate bias. REV, a generalization of HKY, is the most general model and only requires
that the nucleotide substitution process be a reversible
Markov process [28].
Parameter inference and posterior probability
We assume that the tree topology τ of the selected species
for comparative analysis is known. The background distribution π can be first estimated by the relative frequencies
of the four bases of all the sequences in consideration and
treated as known. All other parameters, denoted by θ = (µ,
ν, Q, β, ρ), will be inferred from the data by their maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs). The complete likelihood can be written as:

system consists of a state for conserved sites (c) and a state
for nonconserved sites (n). The two states are associated
with different phylogenetic models (ψc and ψn). The statetransition probabilities are defined by two parameters (µ and
ν) as illustrated. (B) An illustrative alignment generated by
this model: A state sequence (Z) is generated according to µ
and ν. For each site in the state sequence, a nucleotide is
generated for the root node in the phylogenetic tree and
then for subsequent child node according to the phylogenetic
model (ψc or ψn). The observed alignment (X) is composed
of all nucleotides in the leaf nodes. The segment of adjacent
conserved sites (in the gray box) is called a conserved element.

coverage of conserved elements (the density of the conserved sites). The phylogenetic models for nonconserved
and conserved states are denoted as ψn = (Q, π, τ, β) and
ψc = (Q, π, τ, ρβ), respectively. Here π is the vector of background (equilibrium) probabilities for the four nucleotide bases; τ is the tree topology of the corresponding
phylogeny; β is a vector of non-negative real numbers representing branch lengths of the tree, which are measured
by the expected number of substitutions per site; ρ is the
conservation ratio representing the ratio between the substitution rate in conserved regions versus that in nonconserved regions; and Q is a 4-by-4 substitution rate matrix
for the continuous-time Markov process.
Many parametric forms are available for the substitution
rate matrix Q [22,23]. Here we used the parametric forms
in the PAML package [24]. The JC model [25] is the simplest one among all models implemented in PAML; it
assumes a uniform base composition and a uniform rate
for all types of substitutions. F81 [26] assumes that the

where K is the total number of columns in the alignment,
xi is the observed nucleotide vector in the i-th column, zi ∈
{c, n} is the hidden state of the i-th column, (bc, bn) = (ν/
(µ + ν), µ/(µ + ν)) is the initial emission probability of the
HMM, and azi −1zi is the transition probability as illustrated in Figure 1. With the help of the standard forward/
backward procedure for HMM [29] to sum over all possible Z, we can use the EM algorithm [30] to get the MLE of
θ, denoted as θˆ . Based on θˆ , the forward-summationbackward-sampling method [31] can then be used to
compute the posterior probability for a given hidden state
ˆ
to be conserved, i.e., P(z = c|X, θ ). By applying a threshi

old to the posterior probability that a given site is conserved, we finally classify all sites in the alignment as
either conserved or nonconserved. Another possible
approach is to estimate θ using a Bayesian method via the
Gibbs sampler [31].
The Baseline
We estimated the baseline parameters of the phylo-HMM
from the promoter sequences of dog, human, mouse, and
rat, whose evolutionary relationship is represented by the
phylogenetic tree in Figure 2. The promoter sequence of a
gene is defined as the region 2000 bp upstream to 500 bp
downstream of the annotated transcription start site of
that gene. MLAGAN [32] was used to align the promoter
regions of genes in each orthologous gene cluster, which is
defined as a set of 4 genes, each from a different species,
of which any pair are reciprocal-best BLAST hits of each
other (filtered by blastn threshold e-value = 0.001). All

between the sensitivity and specificity at different thresholds.

gaps in the alignment were treated as missing data [7]. If
the average branch length of the phylogenetic tree for the
conserved sites of a gene's promoter region was estimated
to be greater than one substitution per site, the corresponding promoter alignment was considered unreliable
and, thus, removed from our simulation studies. After filtering out such alignments, 8533 orthologous gene clusters remained. Using the REV model for the substitution
rate matrix, we fitted the phylo-HMM to each of these
8533 alignments separately. The baseline is defined by setting the parameters (π, µ, ν, Q, β, ρ) to be the median values of fitted parameters from these 8533 alignments.
Simulation scheme
Given the phylogenetic tree and all model parameter values (π, µ, ν, Q, β, ρ), we first simulated the true state
sequence from the two-state HMM, considering sequences
2500 nucleotides in length. Then, we simulated the ancestral DNA sequence by independently choosing a nucleotide for each site of the state sequence according to π. To
simulate the ungapped alignment of the modern-day
genomes, we followed the phylogenetic tree from its root
for each site. Recursively, we sampled a nucleotide for
each branch point (or leaf) of the tree according to the
Markov transition kernel Q and the length of the branch
that links to the previously-generated branch point.
Assuming that the true topology and the true substitution
model type were known, we computed the posterior probability for each site being conserved from the simulated
alignments. The predicted state sequence was produced by
applying a threshold to the posterior probability. The sensitivity of the method was defined as the proportion of
true conserved sites correctly predicted, and the specificity
was defined as the proportion of predicted conserved sites
that were truly conserved. The Receiver Operating Charac-

The above simulation-prediction procedure was repeated
1000 times under each topology and parameter setting
unless otherwise specified. The median sensitivity and
specificity at each threshold were used to draw a ROC
curve. The inter-quartile range (i.e., the range from the 1st
to 3rd quartiles) was used to reflect the variation of the sensitivity and specificity measures. The size of this range is
related to the length of the alignment. We used the
median and the inter-quartile range instead of the mean
and the standard deviation because the former measures
are more robust and naturally bounded by 0 and 1. We
used the bootstrap method [33] to obtain the 95% confidence interval of the median. The size of the bootstrap
confidence interval is dependent of the number of simulations.

Results and discussion
The Baseline
The baseline parameter values for the phylo-HMM with
REV, as estimated from alignments of orthologous promoters of dog, mouse, rat, and human, are listed in Table
1. The average length of a conserved element is about 50
bp, much longer than the typical length of a transcription
factor binding site. This may be due to the prevalence of
the clustering effect of cis-regulatory elements [34], or the
existence of sequence features that are specific to individual genes instead of transcription factors. The average coverage of conserved elements is about 25%. Estimated
branch lengths of the phylogenetic tree for nonconserved
sites show that the promoter region is more divergent
compared to the protein coding region. For example, the
estimated distance between human and mouse for the
promoter region is 0.788 substitutions per site, whereas
that for the protein coding region is 0.569 substitutions
per site [5].
Power comparison of phylo-HMM and the PID method
We simulated alignments from phylo-HMM with the baseline setting. These alignments were then used by phyloHMM to infer the hidden state sequence conditional on
the true topology and the true substitution model type,
i.e., REV. The power of the phylo-HMM on these simulated alignments was compared with the PID method,
which is a simple but widely used local conservation
measure in comparative genomics [35-40]. Given an
alignment, the PID value of each site was calculated as the
percent of identical columns (i.e., completely conserved
across all comparative species) within a window centered
at the current column. To maximize the performance of
the PID method, we set the window size as the true
expected length of conserved elements, which is 50 + 1 for

The table provides the fitted phylo-HMM parameter values (median values) from the alignments of orthologous promoters of dog, mouse, rat, and
human. MLAGAN was used to align the orthologous promoters. Each promoter alignment of the 8533 orthologous gene clusters was fitted
separately by phylo-HMM using the REV model for the substitution rate matrix.

Influence of branch length at different locations in the tree
It has been suggested that the power of a comparative
genomics method to distinguish conserved sites from
nonconserved ones increases with the total evolutionary
distance in the phylogenetic tree [5,41]. However, it is difficult to obtain a reliable orthologous alignment if the
genomes under consideration are too divergent. Even if
the true orthologous alignment is available, some recent
studies have shown that the power decreases with increasing total branch length in some instances [9,10]. Here we
investigated the effect of varying branch lengths on phyloHMM power.

Both methods were applied to the simulated ungapped
alignment under the baseline setting. Figure 3 shows the
corresponding ROC curves. By choosing 0.5 as the posterior probability threshold for a site to be conserved,
phylo-HMM achieved a median sensitivity of 0.91 at a
median specificity level of 0.94. The 1st – to 3rd- quartiles
of the sensitivity are 0.87 and 0.93, respectively. However,
the PID method only achieved a median sensitivity of
0.73 at the same specificity level. The corresponding 1st –
to 3rd- quartiles of the sensitivity are 0.66 and 0.78, respectively. The inter-quartile range for the estimate is also
larger than that of phylo-HMM. The 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the median estimate is very narrow as
shown in Figure 3, which implies that the variation of the
median estimate is small. Therefore, the power of PID
method is significantly smaller than that of phylo-HMM
method for the baseline. This is generally true if the alignment is generated from the phylo-HMM model with a
non-star-topology tree.

The curves in Figure 4, generated by varying lengths of different branches in the baseline phylogenetic tree, show
the relationship between the median sensitivity and the
length of the branch when the specificity was fixed at 0.9.

length. For topologies with unbalanced branch lengths,
all branches except the long branch have lengths equal to
0.02 substitutions per site. The length of the long branch
is set to match the total branch length. When the number
of genomes under study was small (e.g., equal to 4), the
ROC curve for the symmetric star topology differed very
little from the balanced depth-first binary tree. For larger
numbers of comparative genomes, the symmetric star
topology performed slightly worse than the balanced
binary trees. No detectable power difference was observed
between the two classes of balanced binary trees.

times for each branch length setting considered. It is clear
that for the phylo-HMM model, the power decreases if the
branch length increases beyond a certain critical value. For
example, for the baseline phylogenetic tree, the optimal
value for the middle branch is around 0.8 substitutions
per site. In addition, the plots show that starting from the
baseline branch lengths, the power can be increased more
significantly by increasing the length of the shorter
branches, rather than increasing the length of the longer
branches. This can be seen by noting the way in which the
slopes change for all of the curves, where the first derivative decreases as the branch length increases.
Influence of the tree topology
A common question concerning comparative genomics
studies is how to choose the species. One factor to consider is the evolutionary distance, which we have just
addressed. Another factor is the topology representing the
relationship of these species. By changing the topology
and branch length of the baseline model to those in Figure
5A, we performed simulations to compare the power of
three classes of representative topologies under different
branch length settings (Figure 5B). For topologies with
balanced branch lengths, all branches have the same

Figure 5 also shows that the performance of the unbalanced topologies is much worse than the balanced ones.
This is because the genomes with very short branches are
so close to each other that there is little difference among
them. In other words, the clustering effect of these
genomes decreases the effective number of genomes in
the topology, thus reducing its power. By the same logic,
since the clustering effect for the star topology is more
serious than for the binary trees, the unbalanced star
topology performed much worse than the unbalanced
binary trees. The unbalanced depth-first binary tree performed better than the breadth-first one because genomes
are more widely dispersed in the depth-first tree. Although
not conclusive, these results suggest that the branch
lengths should be balanced among all genomes, and if the
branch lengths are balanced, the topology is not that
important in choosing species for comparative genomics
studies. The power of simpler topologies like the symmetric star topology can be used to approximate the power of
more complex, but balanced topologies with equal total
branch length and the same number of genomes.
Influence of the number of genomes
The number of species to choose is yet another important
problem to consider in performing comparative genomics
studies. Based on conclusions from previous sections, we
investigated this problem using a symmetric star topology
and the common baseline settings, with the exception of
the branch lengths (Figure 6). Assuming each branch is as
long as the distance between mouse and rat, 6 genomes
are needed to achieve a sensitivity of 0.90 at a specificity
of 0.95. Adding 4 more genomes increases the sensitivity
to 0.95 at this same specificity. For shorter branch lengths
(e.g, < 0.2, like the distance between mouse and rat), the
number of genomes required to achieve a desired level of
power scales inversely with the individual branch length.
This scaling property of phylo-HMM is similar to that
established for the individual alignment block model [9].
Effect of different substitution rate models
Several parametric forms are available to model the nucleotide substitution process. Simpler models are obviously
easier to handle. For example, the analytical form of the

Power 5
Power comparison for different topologies. (A) Topologies considered. Topologies in the same row have the same total
branch length and same number of comparative genomes. Each column corresponds to a class of topologies. One unit branch
length is 0.196199 substitutions per site (mouse-rat like). The number of comparative genomes is equal to the number of units.
For topologies with balanced branch lengths, all branches have the same length. For topologies with unbalanced branch lengths,
all branches except the long branch have length equal to 0.02 substitutions per site. The length of the long branch is set to
make the total branch length equal to 8 units. (B) Corresponding ROC curves. As illustrated in the legend, the different groups
of curves represent different topology classes. Different point groups highlighted along the curves represent the different rows
in Figure 5(A). The locations of these points correspond to a posterior probability threshold equal to 0.5. The crosses show
the 1st-to-3rd quartile range of the sensitivity and specificity.

ROC curve is available for the JC model under certain conditions [9,10]. Although models with more free parameters, such as HKY and REV, appear more realistic,
conducting a proper statistical inference for these models
is difficult, and one can actually lose information or overfit the data if an improper analysis is done. Therefore, one
question is whether we can use simpler models to capture
the essential characteristics of the power for the more
complex models. We performed two experiments to investigate this problem.
The first experiment involved comparing the power of various model types. To compare them on a common
ground, we used the same parameter values as in the baseline, with the exception of the substitution rate matrix for
each model type. For JC, we used the uniform background
nucleotide probability. For HKY, we set kappa = 4. For
simulated sequences from each model type, we used the
corresponding true model type to infer the state sequence.
We went through the simulation-prediction procedure
1000 times to get the ROC curve for each model type. The
results are depicted in Figure 7(A) and show that the simpler models (JC and F81) performed slightly better than

the more complex models (HKY and REV), which agrees
with our intuition that simpler models are easier to solve.
At the parameter values set by mimicking these 8533
alignments, however, the observed differences are small.
The second experiment was aimed at characterizing the
effects of simplifying the substitution model. The REV
model has five free parameters, whereas the JC model has
no free parameters. We simulated alignments from the
REV model using the baseline parameters, and then
inferred the state sequence under the simpler JC model.
This perhaps represents a more realistic situation in which
the substitution model in the analysis is a simplification
of the "true" substitution model. Figure 7(B) shows that
the ROC curve for using the true model type is located
within the 95% bootstrap confidence interval of the ROC
curve for using the simplified JC model, which justifies
the use of the simple JC model to study the properties of
more complex models such as REV.
Power comparison for different HMM parameters
Evolutionarily conserved elements within different
regions have different sizes and densities. For example,

Influence of the number of genomes for the symmetric star
Influence of the number of genomes for the symmetric star topology. This graph illustrates the relationship
between one over the number of genomes and the individual
branch lengths. The specificity is fixed at 0.95 in all cases.
Each curve corresponds to a given sensitivity (Sn) level as
illustrated in the legend.

conserved elements in coding regions are much longer
than those in promoter regions, and the coverage of conserved elements (i.e., the percentage of sites that are conserved) in coding regions is higher than those in
intergenic regions. Also, conserved elements in promoter
regions of genes rich in cis-regulatory modules may be
longer than those for other genes. Furthermore, promoter
regions of different genes may have different coverage of
conserved elements. Binding sites for different transcription factors have different lengths as well. All of these variations are modeled by the HMM parameters µ and ν, or
correspondingly, expected coverage (P) and expected element length (L) in the phylo-HMM method.
We simulated alignments by varying the expected coverage and length of conserved elements in order to understand their effect on the power of phylo-HMM (Figure 8).
Under the same expected coverage, a greater expected element length yields better ROC curves with smaller variation. For example, for the same expected coverage P =
0.25, to achieve a median specificity of 0.94, the median
sensitivity for expected element length L = 10, 30, 50, 70,
90 is 0.30, 0.80, 0.91, 0.94, and 0.97, respectively. The
relationship between the median sensitivity and 1/L is
approximately linear with a negative slope. The effect of

the expected coverage for fixed expected element length is
rather complicated because the corresponding ROC
curves cross over. For example, when the expected element length L = 30, to achieve a low specificity like 0.8,
the sensitivity for expected coverage P = 0.45 is higher
than that for P = 0.05. To achieve a high specificity like
0.95, the sensitivity for expected coverage P = 0.45 is lower
than that for P = 0.05. The variation of the ROC curves for
smaller expected coverage is greater than for bigger ones in
the range we considered (P = 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45).
The area under the ROC curve of a larger expected coverage is greater than that of a smaller expected coverage. In
this sense, a larger expected coverage of conserved elements makes them easier to detect.
Power comparison for different conservation ratio
The conservation ratio (ρ), which is defined as the ratio of
the average substitution rate of conserved sites over that of
nonconserved sites, is one of the major factors determining the power of phylo-HMM. Figure 9 shows the power
we can expect for a given conservation ratio under other
baseline settings. For fixed specificity, the relationship
between sensitivity and the conservation ratio is approximately a sigmoid type function: 1/(1 + e13(ρ-0.6)). The
power decreases dramatically with increasing conservation ratio, especially when the conservation ratio is
around 0.6. This poses a problem for the two-state phyloHMM model, which assumes a uniform conservation
ratio along a given alignment. A promoter region could be
bound by several types of transcription factors, and each
of these could have a different conservation ratio compared to the nonconserved background. In this case, the
power evaluation from a uniform conservation ratio is
questionable. This problem can be alleviated by introducing multiple rate classes to form a multiple-state phyloHMM.
Ability to recover the true alignment and its influence on
the power
All simulations discussed so far have been based on the
assumption that we can get the true alignment. Therefore,
the usefulness of the above results is questionable in more
realistic situations where the true alignment is unknown.
We again used simulation to check what alignment accuracy we could achieve under different phylo-HMM parameter settings. We simulated sequences that were 2500 base
pairs long by varying one or a subset of phylo-HMM
parameters around their baseline values. We then used
MLAGAN [32] to align the simulated sequences, assuming
that we knew the topology of the true evolutionary tree.
Real alignment problems are plagued by many different
types of noise in the input sequences (e.g., insertions and
deletions), which inevitably decreases the alignment accuracy. In order to evaluate the alignment accuracy determined by phylo-HMM parameters, we directly fed the

sequences simulated based on the phylo-HMM to MLAGAN without adding additional insertions or deletions.
The alignment accuracy was measured by the column
score [42], which is defined as the number of identical
columns between the true alignment and the recovered
alignment. We further divided the number of identical
columns by 2500 to normalize the column score to the [0,
1] interval.
We evaluated the alignment accuracy for all situations
reported in the previous sections. The column score was
higher than 0.99 for the baseline case and in all cases
where the topology, substitution rate model, HMM
parameters, and the conservation ratio were varied. Figure
10 shows the influence of branch length and the number
of genomes. For the baseline phylogenetic tree, the column score decreases below 0.99 if any of the leaf branches
is longer than 1 substitution per site or the middle branch
is longer than 0.6 substitutions per site. For the symmetric
star-topology tree, if the number of genomes is 4, the column score decreases below 0.99 if the single branch
length is longer than 0.5 substitutions per site. As the
number of genomes increases, the column score decreases
below 0.99 at shorter branch lengths, which implies it is

harder to recover the true alignment if the number of
genomes increases. All of these results suggest that no
branch length should be longer than 1 substitution per
site (e.g., the distance between dog and rat) in order to
realize an accurate alignment. If no branch is too long,
which holds around the baseline setting, the assumption
that a highly accurate alignment is available is valid.
To further investigate the influence of alignment quality
on power, we fitted phylo-HMM to both the true alignment and the recovered alignment. Previously we defined
sensitivity and specificity by comparing the true and predicted state sequences. Since there is no unique true state
sequence corresponding to the recovered alignment, we
instead counted the number of nucleotides located within
conserved sites. We call these nucleotides as conserved
nucleotides. Sensitivity is defined as the proportion of
true conserved nucleotides correctly predicted. Specificity
is defined as the proportion of predicted conserved nucleotides that were truly conserved. For the true alignment,
these definitions are equivalent to the previous version
defined by conserved sites. Figure 11 shows the performance of phylo-HMM on the true alignment and the recovered alignment when we varied the length of the middle

alignment algorithm, which avoids incorporating distant
sequences into the output alignment. MAVID produces
global alignments by assuming that all sites in the alignment evolve at the same speed. MLAGAN produces global
alignments for sequences containing conserved blocks,
which is the exact scenario we are dealing with. The alignment accuracies are similar for the results of the three
aligners when the branch lengths are short (See supplementary Figures 1 and 2 in additional file 1). These results
agree with those reported by Kumar and Filipski [46].
Nevertheless, the power of phylo-HMM is still quite
robust with respect to the alignment quality.

branch in the baseline phylogenetic tree. When the column score is no less than 0.98, the difference of the
median sensitivity between the two scenarios is less than
0.001 when the specificity is fixed at 0.9. When the column score decreases to 0.6, this difference increases to
0.046, which is still quite small. This suggests that the
power of phylo-HMM is robust to the alignment quality
measured by column score. In the case of changing middle branch length in the baseline phylogenetic tree, the
noise caused by bad alignment begins to pull down the
power when the branch length grows to be greater than
one substitution per site.
Besides MLAGAN, we also evaluated the alignment accuracy using TBA [43] and MAVID [44], which have been
used for the recently published ENCODE consortium
alignments [45]. Details are shown in additional file 1.
Among these three aligners, TBA is essentially a local

We used simulations to investigate the statistical power of
phylo-HMM under a number of diverse situations.
Among all factors studied, the number of species-specific
genomes used, evolutionary distance, conservation ratio,
and expected length of the conserved element are the
major factors affecting the power of phylo-HMM. If conditions allow, it is better to select species such that every
branch length in the phylogenetic tree is between 0.6 to 1
substitutions per site. To achieve a desired power, the
number of genomes required in the analysis scales
inversely with the mean branch length if the mean branch
length is small. The conservation ratio and the expected
length of the conserved element are uncontrollable factors. For a fixed specificity, the relationship between the
median sensitivity and one over the expected length of the
conserved element is approximately linear with a negative
slope. We also found that the influence of the topology
and the nucleotide substitution model were relatively
minor. This justifies selecting species with a simpler topology, like the symmetric star topology, and approximating
complex substitution models with less complex, easier to
manipulate ones, like the JC model.
Our analyses of the power of phylo-HMM models were
carried out under a number of simplifying assumptions
that may influence the results reported and the degree to
which they will reflect what can be expected from real
data. First, for the simulations carried out to evaluate
power, we assumed that all sequences were generated
from the phylo-HMM model and that we could get the
true ungapped alignment. In reality, it may be difficult to
locate the orthologous sequences. Even if we can get the
orthologous alignment, gaps are inevitable and it is perhaps inappropriate to treat them as missing data. Second,
the real nucleotide substitution process may be more
complicated than the models we studied here. For example, content dependent substitution is possible. Finally,
the assumption of two evolutionary rates, one for functional elements and the other for neutral background, is
also unrealistic and may affect the power estimate we
obtained. However, these issues notwithstanding, the

Several problems are worthy of further study. First, a
goodness-of-fit test for phylo-HMM on real data remains
to be validated. Second, in the current phylo-HMM
model, once the conservation state of a site is determined
for the common ancestor, it is fixed for all species and is
not allowed to change over the course of evolution. More
flexible models that allow for differences among the conservation states are required for different species. Third,
the conservation annotation conducted by the current
phylo-HMM model represents just one step toward the
goal of functional annotation. A more ambitious
approach would be to directly model the functional elements like transcription factor binding sites. An integrative approach to align the sequences by modeling
evolution events and perform the conservation analysis at
the same time is also desired. This may be feasible within
the start topology JC framework.
