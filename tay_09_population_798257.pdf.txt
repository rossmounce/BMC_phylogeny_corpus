Abstract
Background: Helicobacter pylori is a major gastric bacterial pathogen. This pathogen has been
shown to follow the routes of human migration by their geographical origin and currently the global
H. pylori population has been divided into six ancestral populations, three from Africa, two from
Asia and one from Europe. Malaysia is made up of three major ethnic populations, Malay, Chinese
and Indian, providing a good population for studying recent H. pylori migration and admixture.
Results: Seventy eight H. pylori isolates, including 27 Chinese, 35 Indian and 16 Malay isolates from
Malaysia were analysed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of seven housekeeping genes and
compared with the global MLST data. STRUCTURE analysis assigned the isolates to previously
identified H. pylori ancestral populations, hpEastAsia, hpAsia2 and hpEurope, and revealed a new
subpopulation, hspIndia, within hpAsia2. Statistical analysis allowed us to identify population
segregation sites that divide the H. pylori populations and the subpopulations. The majority of Malay
isolates were found to be grouped together with Indian isolates.
Conclusion: The majority of the Malay and Indian H. pylori isolates share the same origin while the
Malaysian Chinese H. pylori is distinctive. The Malay population, known to have a low infection rate
of H. pylori, was likely to be initially H. pylori free and gained the pathogen only recently from cross
infection from other populations.

Background
Helicobacter pylori may have infected humans since their
origin and currently is believed to infect more than half
the population in the world [1,2]. Infection is usually
acquired during childhood by intrafamilial transmission
and in the majority of cases infection is lifelong unless
eradication by antibiotic treatment is undertaken [3,4].

The prevalence of H. pylori infection ranges from 25% in
developed countries to more than 80% in the developing
regions [3,5,6]. H. pylori is commonly transmitted from
mother to child [3].
H. pylori is well known for being highly diverse and
recombining frequently. DNA sequence analysis of housePage 1 of 13

keeping and virulence associated genes all have illustrated
the unusually high degree of genetic variability in this species [2,7-12]. Comparison of isolates within a single host
sampled over an average of 1.8 years has revealed that an
average of ~100 DNA imports occur between bacteria, corresponding to 3% of the genome or 50 kb [11] and by
extrapolation from these data, it was predicted that within
41 years half the genome would have been replaced by
imports [11]. In comparison, 10–100 million years were
needed to replace 60% of the E. coli genome [13].
Studies suggest that recombination is rare between isolates from different continents and as such H. pylori
behaves like a genetic marker of human descent and
reflects the human population in which the host spent
his/her childhood [2,10,12]. Multilocus sequence typing
(MLST) of seven housekeeping genes from several hundred H. pylori strains isolated from different geographical,
ethnic, and/or linguistic origins showed that H. pylori followed human migration out of Africa and identified six H.
pylori populations which are designated as hpAfrica1,
hpAfrica2, hpNEAfrica, hpEurope, hpEastAsia, and
hpAsia2 [2,12]. Three of these populations are further
divided into subpopulations: hpEastAsia is divided into
three subpopulations, hspEAsia, hspAmerind and hspMaori. The hspMaori subpopulation has been isolated
exclusively from Maoris and other Polynesians and the
hspAmerind from Inuits and Amerinds in North and
South America; hpAfrica1 is divided into hspSAfrica and
hspWAfrica; hpEurope is divided into Ancestral European
1 (AE1) and Ancestral European 2 (AE2).
Countries with populations of multiple origins provide a
good opportunity to further study the population structure of H. pylori. Malaysia is composed of three major ethnic populations: Malay (65%), Chinese (26%) and Indian
(7.7%) http://www.statistics.gov.my. The majority of
Malaysian Chinese migrated from Southern China, the
Malaysian Indians from Southern India and the Malays
are in general considered natives of Malaysia [14]. The
Malaysian Malay population is made up of a mixture of
people extant in South East Asia as early as 3000 years ago
[15]. However, in modern Malaysia they are now referred
to as the Malays [16]. The aboriginal Orang Asli people in
Malaysia do not share the same origin as the Malays [17].
H. pylori Infection is associated with an increased risk of
developing peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer [18,19] as
well as an increased risk of developing primary non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of the stomach (MALT lymphoma) [20].
Previous studies have shown that the Indian ethnic group
has the highest rate of H. pylori infection (68.9–75%), followed by the Chinese (45–60%) and the Malay the lowest
(8–43%) [21,22]. This difference of prevalence was also
found in children [23]. Interestingly the three populations

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/126

have different rates of gastric cancer. While the Malaysian
Chinese population has a high incidence the Malaysian
Indian population has a low incidence [24]. The phenomenon of high prevalence of H. pylori but low incidence of gastric cancer has been dubbed the "Indian Enigma" [24]. A
better understanding of the population structure of H. pylori
in these ethnic populations is clearly needed to order to elucidate the differences in infection rates and disease severity.
We used MLST to analyse H. pylori isolates obtained from the
three ethnic groups in Malaysia. We show the similarity
between the Malay and the Indian H. pylori isolates and the
diversity between the Malaysian Indian H. pylori population
identified in this study and the Indian Ladakh H. pylori population identified by Linz et al. [2].

Results
Nucleotide diversity of the housekeeping genes
Fragments of seven housekeeping genes,atpA (566 bp), efp
(350 bp), mutY (361 bp), ppa (338 bp), trpC (396 bp), ureI
(525 bp), and yphC (450 bp), with a total length of 2,982
bp were sequenced from 78 Malaysian H. pylori isolates,
including 27 Chinese, 16 Malay and 35 Indian isolates.
MLST data of 423 isolates comprising of isolates from two
studies by Achtman's group [2,12] available at the time of
analysis were extracted from the H. pylori MLST database
http://pubmlst.org/helicobacter/ and included in the
analysis with data from this study. The level of nucleotide
diversity between populations and between genes is
shown in Table 1. The most diverse gene was trpC in all
except the Malaysian Chinese population with the highest
diversity at nearly 7.6% while the least diverse gene was
atpA at 2.6%. The three ethnic populations showed different levels of diversity with the Chinese population the
lowest while the Indian and Malay populations were similar. All ethnic groups had lower level of variation than the
global population as a whole.
STRUCTURE analysis
To determine the relationship of the Malaysian H. pylori
isolates and the global isolates, we analysed our MLST
data together with the global data using the Bayesian statistics tool, STRUCTURE [25], which was previously used
to divide global H. pylori isolates into six ancestral populations, designated as hpAfrica1, hpAfrica2, hpNEAfrica,
hpEurope, hpEastAsia and hpAsia2 [2,12]. The Malaysian
H. pylori isolates were found to fall into four of the six
known populations (Fig. 1A). Twenty three Indian and
nine Malay isolates were grouped with hpAsia2; 26 Chinese, four Indian and two Malay isolates grouped with
hpEastAsia; one Chinese, eight Indian and four Malay isolates grouped with hpEurope; and one Malay isolate
grouped with hpAfrica1 (Fig. 1A). Phylogenetic analysis
using the Neighbour joining algorithm as shown in Figure
1B divided the isolates into three clusters, consistent with
the STRUCTURE analysis.

Since some populations can be further divided into subpopulations (Fig. 1A) [2,12], we used the same approach
to further classify the Malaysian isolates into subpopulations. For the Malaysian isolates in the hpEastAsia population, the majority (26 Chinese, three Indian and one
Malay) fell into hspEAsia except for two isolates (one
Indian and one Malay) falling into the hspMaori subpopulation. hpAsia2 had previously no subpopulations.
There were 77 isolates in hpAsia2 including 32 isolates
from this study and 41 Ladakh isolates. Our STRUCTURE
analysis divided these 77 isolates into two subpopulations
(Fig. 2). All 41 Ladakh isolates were grouped as one subpopulation while the remaining 36 isolates including 32
Malaysian Indian and Malay isolates from this study, one
Singapore isolate and three UK isolates (Bangladesh origin) grouped together as another (Fig. 2). Therefore we
named the two subpopulations as hspLadakh and hspIndia respectively. For the 13 Malaysian isolates falling into
hpEurope, three Indian and three Malay isolates belonged
to AE1 while one Chinese, five Indian and one Malay isolate belonged to AE2.
Identification of polymorphisms distinguishing the
subpopulations
Based on above STRUCTURE analysis, we reasoned that
there must be informative bases that support the division
of the subpopulations. To identify these bases, we performed site-by-site pairwise comparisons between subpopulations using Fisher's exact test at a significance level
of 0.05 with Dunn-Sidak correction for multiple site comparisons. We examined five subpopulations in four comparisons, hspLadakh versus hspIndia, hspEAsia versus
hspIndia, hspEAsia versus hspMaori, and hspEAsia versus
hspAmerind subpopulations. Out of the 413, 377, 362
and 377 informative sites in the four pairwise comparisons, 27, 48, 39 and 32 sites respectively support the population divisions and we define these sites as population
segregation sites (PSSs) (Table 1 and Fig. 3). The gene containing the most PSSs was trpC which was also the most

variable gene while the gene carrying the fewest number
of PSSs was ppa with zero or one site. The sites supporting
one subpopulation division may not support another
population division.
The patterns of the PSSs also provided further insight into
recombination between populations. STRUCTURE analysis showed that in all subpopulations there were isolates
with genes from other populations but the analysis did
not identify which gene contributes to the mosaic genetic
background. As shown in Figure 3 for hspIndia and hspLadakh comparison, the PSSs clearly showed the origin of
some imported genes. Some involved the whole gene
while others only involved segments of a gene. Many of
these recombinational events must have occurred in the
original population in India. The identification of the
PSSs supports the results of STRUCTURE analysis which
showed 8.9 to 33.2% imports and for the first time
allowed us to identify the ancient alleles or sites in the
populations concerned. The total number of PSSs
between populations also reflects the distance between
them. The more distantly related populations carry more
segregating sites.
Isolates with identical alleles
H. pylori has been reported to be clonal only over a short
period of time [11] and thus identical alleles among isolates is expected to be rare when sampling a large population. Interestingly, among the 78 Malaysian isolates
analysed, 14 isolates had one or more identical alleles to
other isolates. Two pairs of isolates, FD584i/FD589i, and
FD419m/FD433m were identical in all seven genes; one
pair of isolates, GC48i and FD566c, shared six identical
genes; two pairs of isolates, FD539i and FD523i, and
FD616i and FD540i share four identical genes; another
two pairs of isolates, FD529c and FD519c, and FD556i
and FD574i shared two identical genes and seven sets of
isolates of 2–5 isolates shared one identical gene. Most of
the identical genes were shared among the same ethnic

population. However, we did observe that some genes
were shared by different ethnic populations, most of
which share only one identical gene. An Indian isolate
(GC48i) shared six identical genes with a Chinese isolate
(FD566c) and another Indian isolate (FD560i) had an
identical gene with three Chinese isolates (FD586c,
GC26c and GC52c).
We extended our analysis to include the 423 global isolate
data to screen for identical genes that were shared globally. Fourteen pairs of isolates had all seven genes identical. There were 12, 6, 14, 15, 20, 35 sets with at least two
isolates in each set sharing exclusively 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1
identical alleles respectively. In a small number of cases a
single isolate shared a subset of alleles with isolates that
had a higher number of identical alleles these isolates
were excluded. Isolates shared the most alleles in the efp
gene and the least in ureI and yphC.

Discussion
Population Structure of H. pylori among Malaysian
Populations
H. pylori has been shown to have migrated with its host
out of Africa [2,12] and population differentiation is seen
clearly in different regions of the world. However no studies have looked at recent H. pylori migration histories.
Malaysia has a history of human immigration divided
into three major waves, the earliest human settlement by
the Orang Asli people – the Malay aborigines, the migration of current Malays 3000 years ago, and the mid-nineteenth century migration of Chinese and Indians. There is
no data on H. pylori infection in the Orang Asli people, but
good studies of the other three major ethnic populations
are available [22,23,26]. The H. pylori infection rate and
disease severity are different among the three ethnic populations. This population mixture in Malaysia provided a
good opportunity to determine the H. pylori population
admixture and to enhance our understanding of differences in infection rate and disease severity. We have
shown in this study that the isolates recovered from the
Malaysian H. pylori population belong to three of the
known H. pylori ancestral populations, hpEastAsia,
hpAsia2 and hpEurope. The H. pylori isolates from the
Chinese and Indian individuals were divided along their
ethnic origins. Surprisingly the Malay isolates did not
have a separate origin which is discussed below. There
were six Indian isolates having Chinese H. pylori ancestry
but none the reverse.

The population divisions identified in the current study
are supported by the distribution of the cagA phosphorylation motif EPIYA [27] and vacA alleles [26] reported in
these populations. The predominant EPIYA motif in the
Malaysian Chinese population has been shown to be ABD
(87.8%) while the predominant type in both the Malay-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/126

sian Indian and the Malay populations is ABC with a frequency of 60.5% and 46.2% respectively. For vacA, the
predominant genotype has been reported to be s1a
among the Malaysian Malay (76.6%) and Indian populations (71.0%), and s1c among the Malaysian Chinese
population (66.1%) [26]. Data from these two genes confirm our observation that the Malay H. pylori population
is more similar to Indian than to Chinese population.
It has been suggested that the combined effect of high levels of recombination and diversity does not allow phylogenetic analysis of H. pylori isolates [2,12] and also
implies that one would not expect to find any identical
alleles to be recovered from the population unless they are
from related hosts. However for the first time, we uncovered isolates with identical alleles, ranging from one to
seven alleles, within and between the three Malaysian
populations. The available patient medical information
showed that these isolates were not from related hosts. We
also found isolates with up to seven identical alleles
present in the global MLST data, which was not described
previously. The recovery of isolates with identical alleles
indicates that the frequency of recombination may be
lower and hence clones may be more stable than previously thought. We suggest that isolates with even one
identical allele are likely to be related by decent rather
than recent recombination involving that gene. Thus it
may be possible to determine relationships of isolates if
more genes are sequenced.
The origin of Malay H. pylori
The Malay H. pylori population did not form a group of its
own. The majority (nine of the 16 isolates studied) belong
to the same group as the Indian isolates. Clearly the Malay
isolates share the same origin as the Indian isolates. This
conclusion has a number of implications for the origin of
the Malay people and Malay H. pylori. Previous studies
have shown that H. pylori follows the human route of
migration and reflects human ancestry. However there is
no evidence that ancestral Malays migrated from India.
Currently there are two theories for the origins of Malay
[28], one being of Southeast Asian origin, specifically
sharing common ancestry with the Thais, the Laotians and
the Cambodians while the other of Southern China origin
through migration to Taiwan, then outwards to the Philippines, Borneo, Indonesia and Malaysia. The latter theory is supported by language origins while the former is
supported by genetic evidence [28]. Neither supports
Malays sharing direct common ancestry with Indians.
Therefore for the Malay population, the ancestry of H.
pylori does not reflect human ancestry as in other populations.

This raises the question as to what happened with the
original Malay H. pylori since the human population

Page 7 of 13

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:126

undoubtedly carried the bacterium before migrating out
of Africa. Studies showed that the H. pylori infection rate
in the Malay population is much lower than that in the
Indian population [22]. It is therefore likely that the
Malay population was initially free of H. pylori and that
the H. pylori in the current Malay population has only
recently been acquired from the Malaysian Indian community. It is possible that the Malay population lost its
original H. pylori [29]. However loss of H. pylori in modern
populations is associated with improved living standards
and this would be unlikely to be a plausible explanation
for the initial loss of H. pylori in the Malay population.
While the Indian and Chinese populations have a small
percentage of isolates from populations other than their
ancestral populations (ie hspIndia and hspEAsia respectively), the Malay population has a much higher proportion of isolates (7 of the 16 isolates studied, 43.75%) from
populations other than hspIndia (see discussion below).
This adds support to the hypothesis that the Malay population was initially free from H. pylori and that these isolates were directly imported from other populations
recently. The higher proportion of Malay isolates from the
Indian population than from the Chinese population suggests that there has been greater direct interaction between
the Malay and Indian populations than between the
Malay and Chinese populations. Reduced interaction
between the Malays and Chinese may relate to factors
such as incompatibility in food sources (eg pork) [30]
which may have partly constrained the transmission of H.
pylori from the Chinese to the Malay population.
Another potential source of H. pylori for non-aboriginal
Malays is the Orang Asli population, who originated from
early human migration out of Africa. The Orang Asli is
likely to have taken the "Southern Route" into South East
Asia to reach Malaysia by traveling along the Indian
Ocean Coast line 50–65,000 years ago [31-33]. Therefore
the Orang Asli H. pylori, if it exists, may share common
ancestry with the Indian H. pylori, leading to the observed
similarity of Malay isolates to Indian isolates. However
given that other earlier H. pylori populations such as the
Maori and American Indian populations can be readily
identified [12], one would expect that the Orang Asli H.
pylori population would be unique and identifiable after
such a long period of separation, arguing against acquisition from Orang Asli population and in favour of acquisition from the Indian population.
Flow of H. pylori genes/genotypes among the Malaysian
population and from other populations
Apart from the Malay population who appear to have
gained the majority of its H. pylori isolates from the Indian
population as discussed above, there was also gene flow
from other populations. In particular the Indian and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/126

Malay populations have higher levels of inflow of genes.
Thirteen of the 51 (25.5%) Malaysian Indian/Malay isolates were found grouped with the hpEurope population:
six isolates grouped with AE1 and seven with AE2 (Additional file 1). One Malay isolate was found to be grouped
with hpAfrica1, and one Indian and one Malay isolates
grouped with hspMaori. The Malaysian Chinese population seems to have little inflow of genes from other populations with the exception of one Chinese isolate which
grouped with AE2. The low frequency of Chinese isolates
with other population affinity indicates that this isolate
was more likely to have been acquired by its current or
most recent host directly from an AE2 H. pylori host.
In contrast, the Indian/Malay isolates with ancestral European history (Table 2) are more likely to represent greater
heterogeneity in the Indian/Malay H. pylori population
and not direct transmission of isolates from the current
European population or from early British or Portuguese
colonization as these strains have genes from the Indian
H. pylori gene pool. These isolates contain 8% to 40%
hspIndia genes based on STRUCTURE analysis. By population segregation sites, 14 segments with at least two PSSs
identical to the Indian/Malay population were identified
(data not shown). Three isolates have one identical (PSSs)
allele (FD542i in atpA, FD550i in mutY, FD540i in ureI).
In contrast, the only Chinese isolate (FD493c) with a
European ancestry showed almost no signal of Indian or
Chinese ancestry. Such a diversity of isolates in the Malaysian population is interesting and warrants further studies.
There are two other possible sources of genetic heterogeneity in the Indian H. pylori: century-old importation and
earlier common ancestry. While the colonisation of India
from as early as the fifteenth century by the Portuguese
and later by the British Empire [34] may have contributed
directly to the Indian H. pylori gene pool from the European population. This explanation does not reconcile well
with the observation by Wirth et al. [35] that in the Ladakh
population genes of European ancestry were found
despite the population being in a more pristine region. It
has previously been suggested that AE1 originated in Central Asia because it shares phylogenetic signals with isolates from Estonia, Finland and Ladakh [12,36]. Since the
ancestors of Malaysian Indians and the Ladakhis resided
in the same region and their H. pylori belong to hpAsia2,
it seems likely that this biased share of the gene pool by
the Malaysian Indian/Malay isolates with the AE1 subpopulation is due to an earlier common ancestry. Our
findings are consistent with the studies of Wirth et al. [35],
Linz et al. [2] and Devi et al. [19] that H. pylori in the
Indian population is more heterogeneous in origin,
reflecting perhaps both earlier common ancestry and
recent imports.

$ Denotes % genes allocated to the given population by STRUCTURE analysis

Division of hpAsia2 into subpopulations
The hpAsia2 population was initially defined based on
isolates from Ladakh in Northern India, which represents
the west/middle Asia population. Since the Malaysian
Indian population is known to have originated from
India, the Malaysian Indian isolates were initially not
expected to be distinguishable from the Ladakh population. However, we have shown that the two populations
can be divided within hpAsia2 as subpopulations, hspLadakh and hspIndia (Fig. 2). A total of 27 (or 0.91%) segregating sites among the seven housekeeping genes were
identified to separate the two subpopulations. There is
however considerable gene flow between the two populations. Identical alleles as defined by the PSSs can be
treated as recombination that occurred in the more distant past. These alleles are present in three genes (atpA, efp
and ureI). Further many segments with at least two identical PSSs are present in three other genes (mutY, trpC and
yphC; Fig. 3). Note that ppa has no PSSs. These results suggest that there is considerable population admixture in
the earlier history of the Indian population. A recent study
of the Indian population sequenced 23 isolates by MLST
but the sequences are shorter [19]. STRUCTURE analysis
of combined data from our Malaysian Indian isolates,
Ladakh isolates and these 23 Indian isolates using k = 2
populations and found that the Malaysian Indian isolates
grouped together with the Indian isolates while the
Ladakh isolates were separate. However, when k = 3 populations were used, the two sets of Indian isolates were
separated (data not shown). This suggests that the two
Indian populations overlap but are distinctive. The Malaysian Indian H. pylori population may have differentiated
further from the Indian H. pylori population from India,
although it is also possible that the difference between the
two H. pylori populations reflects regional differences in

India as the Malaysian Indians mainly came from South
India.

Conclusion
This study has shown that the Malaysian H. pylori isolates
can be differentiated into three populations using MLST,
being hpEastAsia, hpAsia2 and hpEurope. Interestingly
the Malay population was shown to carry H. pylori isolates
of Indian origin. The infection rate of H. pylori among the
Malay population is low in comparison to the Malaysian
Indian population [22]. In western countries a low or
reduced rate of H. pylori infection is attributed to high or
improved hygiene standard [3]. However this factor does
not account for differences between the Malay and the
other two populations [21,22]. Therefore the Malay population was likely to be initially H. pylori-free and has
acquired H. pylori only recently from the Indian population. Thus the low H. pylori infection rate in the Malay
population may be due to low cross infection rate from
another population.
The Malaysian Indian/Malay isolates were found to differ
from the Ladakh isolates from India and in fact formed a
new subpopulation, hspIndia. Clearly there are more subpopulations of H. pylori and populations can be divided at
a finer scale when more isolates are used or more geographical regions are sampled. More extensive worldwide
surveys will help us further understand the evolution and
population structure of H. pylori, an organism that has
impacted more than half of the world's population and
continues to pose great risk to human health because of its
association with gastric cancer and MALT lymphoma.
Genetic heterogeneity of the bacterium within a host population as shown in this study should be taken into
account when studying the epidemiology and pathogene-

and severity of the disease in different populations.

incubated at 65°C for 15 min to evaporate the residual
ethanol.

Methods

PCR assay and DNA sequencing
The primer sequences for MLST of the seven house keeping genes used in this study were those described by Achtman et al. [10]. Primers were synthesized commercially
(Sigma-Aldrich). Each PCR reaction included 2.0 μl DNA
template (approx. 20 ng), 0.5 μl (30 pmol/μl) of each forward and reverse primer, 0.5 μl of dNTP (10 mM), 5 μl of
10 × PCR buffer (500 mM KCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0,
1% Triton X-100 and 15 mM MgCl2), 0.25 μl of Taq
polymerase (1.25 U) and MilliQ water to a total volume
of 50 μl. PCR cycles were performed in a Hybaid PCR
Sprint Thermocycler (Hybaid): initial DNA denaturation
for 2 min at 94°C, followed by DNA denaturation for 15
sec at 94°C, primer annealing for 30 sec at 50°C, and
polymerization for 90 sec at 72°C for 35 cycles, with a
final extension of 5 min at 72°C. PCR products were verified on ethidium bromide stained agarose gels. PCR
product for sequencing was purified using sodium acetate/ethanol precipitation. The 20-μl PCR sequencing
mixture contained 1 μl of BigDye (version 3.1; Applied
Biosystems), 20 ng of the purified PCR product, 3.5 μl of
5× PCR sequencing buffer (Applied Biosystems), 1 μl of
forward primer (concentration, 3.2 pmol/μl; SigmaAldrich), and MilliQ water. Unincorporated dye was
removed by ethanol precipitation. The sequencing reaction mixtures were resolved on an ABI 3730 automated
DNA sequence analyzer (Applied Biosystems) at the
sequencing facility of the School of Biotechnology and
Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales,
Sydney, Australia.

Source of gastric biopsies and culture of H. pylori isolates
Gastric biopsies were collected as part of a large-scale gastric cancer study conducted in symptomatic patients
undergoing gastroenterological examination at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia. All biopsies were obtained with the informed
consent of the patients and this study was approved by the
Human Ethics Committees of the University of New
South Wales and the University of Malaya. Based on endoscopic and histological examinations, patients were diagnosed as having gastric cancer or functional dyspepsia. All
except seven samples were from patients with functional
dyspepsia as shown in Table 2.

H. pylori was cultured by inoculating biopsies on Campylobacter selective agar (CSA) containing 4% blood base agar
No. 2 (Oxoid), defibrinated horse blood (Oxoid), and
one vial of Skirrow's supplement (Oxoid) containing 2.5
mg Trimethoprim, 5.0 mg Vancomycin, and 1250 IU polymyxin B. Primary cultures were incubated at 37°C with
10% CO2 in a CO2 incubator (Plymouth, USA) for up to
10 days, observing daily for growth. For isolation of pure
cultures a single colony was picked and subcultured onto
CSA for four days. Identification of H. pylori was based on
microscopic morphology and biochemical testing (urease, oxidase and catalase). One isolate from each biopsy
was selected for this study and 78 isolates were obtained
from patients of different ethnic background, including
27 Chinese, 35 Indian and 16 Malay (Table 2). We used
all Malay biopsy samples available. Despite the fact that
this study spanned a period of four years the number of
Malay subjects from whom H. pylori could be cultured was
low which reflects the relative low prevalence in this population. Isolates from this study are available to researchers upon request to HM.
Chromosomal DNA purification
One plateful of bacterial culture was collected and suspended into 215 μl of Tris (50 mM), 15 μl of EDTA (0.5
M) and incubated for 10 min. Two μl of proteinase K (10
mg/ml) and 20 μl of SDS (10%) were added followed by
incubation at 50°C for a minimum of 2 h or until clear.
One μl of RNase (10 mg/ml) was added and incubated at
65°C for an additional 20 min. the mixture was then
transferred into a 1.5 ml Heavy Gel Phase tube (Eppendorf) and washed twice with one volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and once with one
volume of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The top
layer was transferred into a new 1.5 ml tube containing
600 μl of pre-chilled EtOH (100%). Precipitated DNA was
then spooled out, washed in 70% (v/v) EtOH, dissolved
in 100 μl TE buffer (10 mM Tris 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) and

Bioinformatic analysis
PHRED PHRAP and CONSED [37] program package,
accessed through the Australia National Genomic Information Service, was used for sequence editing. PILEUP
from the Genetics Computer Group package [38], and
MULTICOMP [39], were used for multiple sequence
alignment and comparison. PHYLIP [40] was used to generate phylogenetic trees. STRUCTURE version 2.2 [25],
which implements a Bayesian approach for deducing population structure from multilocus data, was used to analyse the population clustering of an isolate, assuming that
each isolate has derived all of its ancestry from only one
population. The number of populations, K, was determined under the "no admixture" model and in each simulation run, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
simulation of 30,000 iterations approximated the posterior probability of K, following a burn-in of 10,000 iterations. After multiple runs on each K assumed, the value
that generated the highest posterior probability was used
as the number of possible populations. The assignment of
an isolate to a particular population was done under the
linkage model.

Segregation site Analysis
Gene sequences from two populations were aligned and
compiled by PILEUP and MULTICOMP. Informative sites,
which are defined as those with at least two variants at a
particular site and more than one isolate for each base variant, were extracted from output generated by MULTICOMP and examined using Microsoft EXCEL. Total base
changes at each informative site present in each population were summed and formed a 2 × 2 table for Fisher's
Exact test using SPSS (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). For those
informative sites that have more than two variants, the
least frequent base was removed and treated as a missing
value. The probability of each site generated by SPSS was
adjusted using Dunn-Sidak correction: α' = 1 - (1 - α)1/p,
where α' represent adjusted probability, α represent the
significance value (0.05 used in this study) and p represent the total number of comparisons.

The GenBank accession numbers for the sequences
reported in this study are FJ846683 – FJ847228.
