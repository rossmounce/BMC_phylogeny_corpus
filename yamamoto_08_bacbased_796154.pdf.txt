Abstract
Background: In 2004, draft sequences of the model lepidopteran Bombyx mori were reported
using whole-genome shotgun sequencing. Because of relatively shallow genome coverage, the
silkworm genome remains fragmented, hampering annotation and comparative genome studies.
For a more complete genome analysis, we developed extended scaffolds combining physical maps
with improved genetic maps.
Results: We mapped 1,755 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) end sequences onto 28 linkage groups using a recombining male backcross
population, yielding an average inter-SNP distance of 0.81 cM (about 270 kilobases). We
constructed 6,221 contigs by fingerprinting clones from three BAC libraries digested with different
restriction enzymes, and assigned a total of 724 single copy genes to them by BLAST (basic local
alignment search tool) search of the BAC end sequences and high-density BAC filter hybridization
using expressed sequence tags as probes. We assigned 964 additional expressed sequence tags to
linkage groups by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of a nonrecombining female
backcross population. Altogether, 361.1 megabases of BAC contigs and singletons were integrated
with a map containing 1,688 independent genes. A test of synteny using Oxford grid analysis with
more than 500 silkworm genes revealed six versus 20 silkworm linkage groups containing eight or
more orthologs of Apis versus Tribolium, respectively.
Conclusion: The integrated map contains approximately 10% of predicted silkworm genes and has
an estimated 76% genome coverage by BACs. This provides a new resource for improved assembly
of whole-genome shotgun data, gene annotation and positional cloning, and will serve as a platform
for comparative genomics and gene discovery in Lepidoptera and other insects.

Background

Genome analysis of insects has moved quickly in recent years,
in part because insects are so widespread and diverse, and
elucidating their characteristic biological phenomena will
yield enormous resources for basic science, agriculture, and
industry. Complete genome sequences have been published
for 12 Drosophila spp. [1-3], Anopheles gambiae [4] and Apis
mellifera [5], and that of Tribolium castaneum will appear
shortly [6]. In 2004, the draft sequence of Bombyx mori was
reported independently by groups in Japan [7] and China [8].
Because of relatively shallow genome coverage (3× and 6×,
respectively) using the whole-genome shotgun (WGS)
sequencing method, the silkworm genome is still somewhat
fragmented, with an average contig length of under 6 kilobases (kb). This makes it difficult to identify and annotate
genes effectively, or to obtain a global view of the silkworm's
general and unique features as a model for Lepidoptera.
Well developed genetic resources for silkworm include more
than 400 described morphologic and biochemical mutants
[9], affecting such characters as chorion (eggshell) composition and structure; embryo development; larval cuticle transparency, pigmentation, segment identity, and body shape;
hemolymph proteins; cocoon color, shape, and texture; and
adult fertility, egg laying behavior, eye color, and wing pattern. These have been assigned to more than 200 loci on linkage maps. Additionally, molecular linkage maps composed of
various markers including about 1,000 random amplified
polymorphic DNAs [10,11], about 250 RFLPs (restriction
fragment length polymorphism) [12-14], 545 amplified fragment length polymorphisms [15], more than 500 simple
sequence repeats [16,17], more than 500 single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNPs) [18], and more than 400 sequence
tagged sites for cloned genes and expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) [19] have been constructed. Three bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) libraries [20,21] and more than 185,00
ESTs [22-24] are also available. For a more complete genome
assembly and analysis, and to take full advantage of these
extensive resources, it is of great importance to combine
genetic maps with physical map information. This can be
accomplished by connecting genetic mapping data to BAC
clones; this is a well established approach that has not been
employed in silkworm on a genome-wide basis.
Our aim in the present study was to conduct a complete
genome analysis. We report here an integrated map between
a high-density SNP genetic map and a physical map of BAC
contigs using the following strategy: extension of the previous
SNP linkage map using BAC end sequences to produce a second-generation map containing 1,755 SNP markers; construction of BAC contigs using two methods, namely
restriction digest fingerprinting of BAC clones and hybridization of ESTs to a BAC library on high-density replica (HDR)
filters; and assignment of 1,082 ESTs to existing linkage
groups by Southern analysis using a nonrecombining female
informative backcross. Finally, we searched for orthologs

among 1,688 genes on the updated silkworm linkage maps
and tested the level of synteny with honey bee and beetle
chromosomes using the Oxford grid method.

Results
Linkage map construction
We previously constructed a linkage map by surveying the
segregation patterns of 534 SNPs detected in 190 first-generation backcross (BC1) individuals from a single pair mating
between a p50T female and an F1 male (p50T female × C108T
male) [18]. Based on the analysis of additional data with Mapmaker/exp (version 3.0 [25]; LOD [log of the odds] score 3.0)
using the same mapping panel, we successfully positioned a
total of 1,755 SNPs on an expanded linkage map. The SNP
markers segregated into 28 linkage groups, with a total
recombination length of 1,413 cM. We assigned 26 of the SNP
linkage groups to classical silkworm chromosomes 1 to 26,
defined by morphologic markers (for example, cocoon color
and larval markings) and protein polymorphisms (for
instance, hemolymph proteins), as reported previously [18].
Unambiguous morphologic markers are not yet available for
the remaining two classical linkage groups; therefore, we
anchored linkage group 27 to a reference gene (vitellogenin),
and arbitrarily defined linkage group 28.
The extended SNP linkage map is illustrated in Figures 1 to
5[26] (Additional data file 1 for details of each marker, including BAC accession number). Basic map parameters are significantly improved in this version. The number of markers per
linkage group varies from 20 (group 2) to 105 (group 4; Figure 1), and the recombination length for each linkage group
ranges from 42.2 cM (group 15; Figure 3) to 68 cM (group 24;
Figure 4). In the previously reported SNP map [18], the minimum and maximum number of markers were seven (groups
26 and A; Figure 5) and 32 (group 10; Figure 2), and the linkage map lengths ranged from 27 cM (group 20; Figure 4) to
64 cM (group 11; Figure 2). The number of markers for individual linkage groups in the revised map increased proportionally to the threefold rise in the total number of markers,
but the extension of the linkage maps remained relatively
small, because of a higher marker density. The average distance between the markers is 0.81 cM, which is much
improved compared with that of the previous map (2.5 cM).
The markers are not evenly distributed throughout the linkage map, and so different regions are more densely or
sparsely populated. The number of gaps with lengths exceeding 10 cM decreased to five from 14 in the previous map, and
the largest gap length decreased to 12.4 cM from 21.3 cM.

BAC contig construction by DNA fingerprinting
We fingerprinted a total of 81,024 BACs from three BAC
libraries, each made with a different restriction enzyme
(Table 1), using the large-scale agarose gel-based restriction
fingerprinting method [27,28]. We used the computer program FPC V6.0 [29,30] to assemble BAC contigs from the

BAC fingerprints. We performed preliminary tests to determine appropriate tolerance and cut-off value parameters, and
adopted values of 3 and 1 × e-12, respectively. A lower stringency condition produced larger contigs, but it also increased
the risk for false contigs because of a high density of repetitive
sequences.
Of the clones fingerprinted, we deleted 2,246 BACs during
fingerprint editing because of insert-empty clones, having too
many bands because of possible contamination, or too few

bands (fewer than five). In addition, we removed 1,152 BACs
from contigs assembled by the FPC program because they
formed an extensive false contig, in which several constituting BACs were assigned to different chromosomes by independent BAC-fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments
(data not shown). The false BAC contig is likely to have
formed from transposon-rich regions with similar restriction
fingerprints, which were difficult to remove even by the use of
high-stringency assembly conditions (namely, with a cut-off
below 1 × e-12).

The resulting physical map contained 6,221 contigs, among
which 782 major contigs included eight or more BAC clones,
as summarized in Table 2 (Additional data file 2). The total
length of the 782 major contigs was 376 megabases (Mb),
which corresponds to 79% of the silkworm genome (476 Mb
measured by flow cytometry; Johnston JS, personal
communication).

We evaluated the reliability of the predicted BAC contigs
using two approaches. First, using BAC end sequences [31] we
designed primer sets for the BAC clones belonging to a putative contig to determine the presence or absence of the
sequence in each BAC clone independently by PCR. Using this
method, we found mis-assemblies in six contigs out of the 782
major BAC contigs; we could not determine whether nine

additional contigs, which we denote as 'doubtful', were correctly formed. In most cases of doubtful contigs, only one BAC
clone bridged two well defined clusters of overlapped BACs.
Such a BAC clone is likely to be chimeric. Therefore, we
removed such chimeric and doubtful BAC clones from the 15
BAC contigs involved, which no longer represented a contradiction in our evaluation.

resolve the contradictions because most of the BAC end
sequences in question corresponded to repetitive transposon
sequences, and PCR provided similar bands even if BACs in
the false contig belonged to different chromosomes. This situation reinforced the supposition that BAC clones forming all
or most of the false contigs were derived from transposonrich domains that produced similar restriction band patterns.

The second approach was a comparison with SNP markers. If
a BAC contig included more than two SNPs, then those markers should be positioned around the same locus. A total of 128
BAC contigs contained more than two SNP markers, among
which we found contradictions in 11 BAC contigs. We checked
the 11 contigs by PCR using primers designed from BAC end
sequences, as described above. However, we were unable to

Integration of the linkage map and BAC contigs
Altogether we mapped 581 BAC contigs containing 6,061
BACs onto 28 chromosomes through BAC clones containing
SNP markers common to the linkage map. The length of
mapped singletons and BAC contigs calculated for each
chromosome is shown in Table 3. A total of 361.1 Mb are cov-

From the number of positive BAC clones screened by HDR filter hybridization, we could roughly estimate whether the
probe cDNA was a single-copy or multiple-copy gene, or contained a repetitive sequence. Table 4 summarizes the results
of the EST hybridization experiments. For EST mapping, we
employed only putative single-copy genes, based on filter
hybridization characteristics and the number of positive hits
per filter. For a single-copy gene, approximately 13 BACs
should give hybridization signals. Of 692 putative single-copy
genes identified by this procedure, we were able to assign 523
EST markers to chromosomes by identifying BACs common
to fingerprinted contigs that had been integrated with the
genetic map via SNP markers (Additional data file 1). We
identified an additional 353 ESTs on the mapped contigs by
BLAST search of BAC end sequences. Of these 152 were duplicates, yielding a total of 724 mapped single-copy genes. For
confirmation of the initial map assignments, we designed
specific primer sets to amplify expected ESTs on HDR filterscreened BACs by PCR (Additional data file 1).

for positional cloning. A large EST database is available in
silkworm [22-24]. Therefore, in addition to using DNA fingerprinting for the construction of BAC contigs, we employed
the 'overlapping' method with EST markers, whereby BAC
clones arrayed on HDR filters are subjected to large-scale
screening by hybridization with individual, nonredundant
ESTs to identify clones carrying single copy sequences. This
approach helped confirm BAC contigs and allowed us to identify functional genes on the combined physical-genetic map.
For screening we used the RPCI-96 BAC library, consisting of

In parallel with the HDR filter hybridization experiments, we
carried out RFLP analysis of segregants from a backcross
between an F1 female (p50T × C108T) and a C108T male
using a common set of ESTs as hybridization probes. The lack
of meiotic crossing over in females results in complete linkage, enabling fast and efficient chromosome assignment of
large numbers of markers using small segregant populations
[13]. We assigned a total of 1,082 ESTs to linkage groups by
RFLP analysis (Table 5 and Additional data file 3); of these,
118 ESTs were mapped in duplicate using HDR filter hybridization or BAC end SNPs. In addition to providing independent confirmation of linkage assignments on the integrated
SNP-physical map, the linkage assignment of 964 new ESTs
will enable future annotation and evaluation of mapped scaffolds in the WGS assembly now in progress [7,8] (Mita K, Xia
Q, personal communication).

orthology between silkworm and other model holometabolous insects for which complete genome data were available,
notably A. mellifera, T. castaneum, A. gambiae, and Drosophila melanogaster, in order to compare the syntenic rela-

tionships among them. We did not conduct an analysis of
synteny relative to dipteran chromosomes because of their
small number, which would produce many false connections,
and their high rate of chromosome rearrangement [32-34],
which would probably reduce the number of significant syntenic blocks within chromosome arms or segments. Among

We used two high-density replica (HDR) filters containing a total of 36,864 independent bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones for
hybridization experiments (13× genome coverage). We did not include the expressed sequence tag (EST) if one of the two filters gave poor results
because of smearing or high background, or if the two filters gave imbalanced numbers of positive signals (for instance, the ratio of positive signals
between two filters exceeded 5). Cut-off values used to define gene copy number were as follows: single copy gene, 2 to 15 positive signals; two copy
gene, 16 to 29 positive signals; > 3 copy gene, > 30 positive signals; and repetitive sequence, > 50 copies. We mapped 523 single copy genes
represented by these hybridized ESTs via single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers.

1,688 silkworm genes, we found 769 orthologs for A. mellifera and 790 for T. castaneum that could be used for a test of
synteny. We then checked the distribution of silkworm gene

orthologs in honey bee and beetle chromosomes (Additional
data file 3).

Figure grids
Oxford 6
Oxford grids. Shown are Oxford grids displaying a matrix of cells comparing the number of orthologous genes on chromosomes of two species. (a)
Silkworm-honey bee comparison. (b) Silkworm-Tribolium comparison. Shadowed cells show high synteny conservation (eight or more orthologs).

Figure 6 presents Oxford grids showing the number of shared
orthologs mapped in honeybee (555 total) and beetle (628
total) on silkworm chromosomes. Based on the simplifying
assumption that chromosomes are of equal length and shared
orthologs are uniformly distributed throughout the genome,
the ratios of observed versus expected silkworm orthologs per
chromosome should be 1.0. The ratios of shared orthologs per
chromosome fell in the range of 0.75 to 1.3 in the 16 honey bee
chromosomes [35] and 0.8 to 1.2 in the ten beetle
chromosomes [36], which is consistent with the possibility
that the mapped silkworm genes were randomly sampled for
both genomes.
A striking feature of this analysis is that a very poor syntenic
relationship exists between silkworm and honey bee (Figure
6a) compared with that of silkworm and beetle (Figure 6b).
Thus, only six chromosomes of the silkworm genome, namely
linkage groups (LGs) 10, 12, 15, 17, 22 and 28 (shaded in Figure 6a), share high syntenic conservation with honey bee
chromosomes (eight or more shared orthologs). In contrast,
20 silkworm chromosomes, namely LGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23 and 25 (shaded in Figure
6b), exhibit high correspondence of synteny conservation relative to beetle chromosomes. Consistent with these findings,
honey bee chromosomes had fewer shared silkworm

orthologs than did beetle (average 9 versus 12.7 orthologs per
chromosome), and the fraction of shared orthologs in syntenic groups was much smaller (0.07 in honey bee versus 0.35
in beetle). For most of the orthologous genes, homology
scores between silkworm and honey bee were similar to those
between silkworm and beetle, indicating that the rate of evolutionary change was comparable, whereas those for Diptera
were frequently lower (data not shown).

Discussion

The 3.3-fold increase in SNP markers from 534 in our previous study to 1,755 in the present one represents a significant
improvement in the quality of the linkage map. This is
reflected by a roughly proportional decrease in average
marker spacing from 2.5 cM to 0.81 cM, or approximately 270
kb. Despite the increase in markers, the total recombination
length only increased from 1,305 cM [18] to 1,413.4 cM, or
1.08-fold, suggesting that map lengths determined by our
method are reaching asymptotes. This may reflect factors that
would reduce detection of crossing over in a relatively small
mapping population (190 individuals), such as a high frequency of double crossovers and the presence of gene-dense
regions along chromosomes. The recombination map length
obtained in this study is approximately half that obtained in

projects using random amplified polymorphic DNA (3,229
cM [19]) and simple sequence repeat (3,432 cM [16]) markers, which is not easily explained and awaits integration of
markers from independent studies into a single linkage map.
The total length of the genome covered by mapped BACs
amounted to 361.1 Mb, corresponding to 76% genome coverage in the present integrated map, in which BACs and BAC
contigs produced by fingerprinting were aligned on the SNP
linkage map through common BAC markers (Table 3). This
suggests that the present SNP markers cover most of the silkworm genome.
Two linkage groups, 11 (64 cM) and 24 (68 cM), are significantly longer than the others. One explanation for this is the
high frequency of double crossovers in these two chromosomes. The double-crossover frequency of group 24 is especially high, at 7.9% (15/190) of all detected recombinants,
with group 11 next, at 6.3% (12/190). By contrast, double
crossover frequencies of the other linkage groups are in the
range of 0% to 2%. Consistent with these observations is that
these two chromosomes are observed cytologically to be
longer than the others [37]. In addition, group 11 contains the
nucleolus organizer region, and group 24 has strongly stained
DAPI (4,6 diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride)
regions, which are speculated to be heterochromatin [37].
Such special chromosome structures might cause the
observed high frequency of crossing over, yielding longer
recombination lengths for the two linkage groups. Further
investigation is required to clarify the role and mechanism of
double crossovers in the two longest linkage groups, as well as
to determine the strain and population distribution of recombination frequency variation. In potentially related observations, polygenic factors have been proposed to be responsible
for differences in recombination frequency between morphological markers on linkage group 2 in artificially selected high
and low recombination silkworm lines [38,39].
The difference in relative divergence times between honey
bee, beetle, and silkworm based on phylogenomic analyses
[40,41] provides a partial explanation for the difference in
synteny that we observed, with longer evolutionary time enabling more chromosome rearrangements. Another potential
contributing factor is the average genome-wide recombination rate, which is 2.97 cM/Mb (1,413 cM/476 Mb) for silkworm in our study. This is within the same order of
magnitude reported for T. castaneum (2.87 cM/Mb), D. melanogaster (1.59 cM/Mb), and A. gambiae (0.84 cM/Mb),
whereas a much higher rate, 19 cM/Mb, was reported for A.
mellifera [42]. This, together with changes in chromosome
number, could account for more extensive gene reorganization in honey bee than beetle relative to silkworm.
Of interest is that we found a larger number of silkworm
orthologs on conserved linkage groups in both honey bee and
beetle than an earlier study, which was based on the 6× WGS
assembly (six and four orthologs listed in synteny in the Tri-

Volume 9, Issue 1, Article R21

bolium and Apis genomes, respectively [41]). A likely explanation is that the genome-wide scaffold reported here is much
more extensive than the initial WGS genome assembly, presenting a larger chromosome-anchored dataset for comparison. Recent studies reveal extensive synteny among
lepidopteran insects [19,43,44]. The extent of microsynteny,
or conservation of close linkage among shared orthologs
within chromosomes, remains an important question for
understanding patterns of genome evolution among Lepidoptera and other holometaboous insects, which will await a
more complete assembly and annotation of the silkworm
genome.

Conclusion

The integrated genetic-physical map with 76% genome coverage by BACs provides a powerful basis for construction of
minimum BAC tiling paths, which is an essential resource for
positional cloning. The average distance between SNP
markers of 270 kb, in combination with new sequencing data
generated for a forthcoming re-assembly of the initial WGS
data [7,8], will allow us to obtain super-scaffolds of megabase
order in the near future. Our assignment of nearly 10% of predicted silkworm genes [7,8] to 28 chromosomes will not only
facilitate construction of accurate scaffolds and annotation of
the silkworm genome, but also provide a valuable resource for
testing microsynteny and gene discovery in Lepidoptera and
other insects.

Materials and methods
Silkworm strains and crosses
The inbred silkworm strains p50T and C108T, maintained at
the University of Tokyo, were used as parental strains for the
mapping panels. For linkage map construction, the same
population of 190 segregants of a single-pair backcross (BC1)
between a p50T female and an F1 male (p50T female × C108T
male) was used as the first-generation SNP map [18].

Genomic DNA extraction
Genomic DNA of parental strains, F1 individuals and segregants from the female-informative backcross was isolated
from whole bodies of fifth instar larvae after removing midguts and hemolymph, as described in a previous report [14].
Genomic DNA of individual BC1 segregants was isolated from
whole pupae using DNAzol (Invitrogen Japan K.K., Tokyo,
Jpn) after freezing in liquid nitrogen and homogenization
with stainless steel beads.

Survey of the SNPs between p50T and C108T
For the linkage map construction, SNPs, including small base
insertions and deletions, were used. The SNPs were identified
in a large number of PCR amplicons that were synthesized
using primers designed from the data obtained by BAC end
sequencing, as reported previously [18]. Briefly, for each end
sequence, we designed a PCR primer pair using Primer3 [45],

and performed PCR amplification of the genomic DNA of the
parental (p50T and C108T) and F1 strains with ExTaq
(TaKaRa Bio Inc., Otsu, Shiga, Jpn), using the manufacturer's
instructions. We detected the presence of SNPs in these
amplicons by sequencing all three genotypes and analyzing
the resulting traces using PolyPhred [46].

containing 185,765 sequences. In this search, the e value (a
probability cut-off value) was set to 1 × e-50 and no complexity
filter was used. The cDNA/ESTs of B. mori were retrieved
from NCBI-GenBank Flat Files (release 159.0) with a custom
Perl script (Additional data file 1).

Fingerprinting analysis and BAC contig construction
Linkage map construction
Linkage map construction was carried out as previously
reported [18]. Genomic DNA of the same 190 BC1 segregants
was amplified with primer sets corresponding to the SNPs
detected between parent strains, and polymorphism in the
segregants was determined (Additional data file 1). Segregation patterns were analyzed using Mapmaker/exp (version
3.0 [25]) with the Kosambi mapping function [47]. For genotyping polymorphisms, we directly sequenced PCR amplicons
from BAC end regions and used a fluorescent polarization dye
terminator SNP detection assay [18,48] in parallel.

BAC libraries
Three BAC libraries prepared using different restriction
enzymes were emplyed in the present study; their characteristics are summarized in Table 1. A BAC library was constructed from genomic DNA of strain p50T fifth instar day 3
posterior silk glands partially digested with EcoRI [21], designated RPCI-96 (RP96), and is available from BACPAC
Resources of the Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute [49]. The HindIII-BAC library was prepared using HindIII partial digestion of the same p50T strain DNA [20]. The
BamHI library, similarly prepared with BamHI using DNA
from a strain derived from the same line as p50T (Wu C,
Goldsmith M, personal communication) was purchased from
the Laboratory for Plant Genomics and GENEfinder Genomic
Resource of Texas A&M University [50]. All three libraries
were fingerprinted for the construction of genome-wide BAC
contigs. The RPCI-96 and BamHI-BAC libraries were used
for SNP analysis; the EcoRI-BAC library was used for EST
mapping by HDR filter hybridization.

BAC HDR filter hybridization with EST probes
RPCI-96-BAC clones arrayed in duplicate in a specific pattern
onto nylon membranes (HDR filters) were obtained from
BACPAC Resources of the Children's Hospital Oakland
Research Institute [49]. Labeling, hybridization, and detection were performed using the ECL Direct Nucleic Acid Labeling and Detection System (GE Heathcare UK Ltd., Little
Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK), in exact accordance with
the manufacturer's instructions [21]. Probes derived from
ESTs were obtained by PCR amplification of plasmid cDNA
inserts using universal sequencing primers corresponding to
the plasmid vectors (see below). EST library construction and
analysis have been reported [22].

BLAST search
The BLASTN [51] search of 1,755 BAC end sequences was carried out against an in-house collection of B. mori cDNA/ESTs

DNA fingerprinting analysis was used to construct BAC contigs. The detailed protocol is reported in Marra and coworkers
[27], and we followed the steps described by Osoegawa and
coworkers [28] exactly. BAC DNA was isolated from 1.2 ml
cultures of LB medium containing chloramphenicol using an
automated method (PI-1100; Kurabo Industries Ltd, Osaka,
Japan) and dissolved in 50 μl of TRIS-EDTA buffer.
Approximately 6 ng (3 μl) of DNA was digested in a 20 μl reaction containing five units of EcoRI at 37°C overnight. When
the digestion was completed, 4 μl of 6× loading buffer (15%
Ficoll [Sigma-Aldrich Japan K. K., Tokyo, Jpn], 0.25%
bromophenol blue, and 0.25% xylene cyanol) was added and
3 μl of EcoRI-digested DNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel
in 1ξ Tris-Acetate-EDTA buffer at 90 V for 15 minutes, then at
45 V for 12 hours. Electrophoresis was carried out in Horizon
20-25 electrophoresis tanks (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) at 16°C. Size markers containing 12.5 ng/μl
Analytical Marker DNA, Wide Range Ladder (Promega K. K.,
Tokyo, Jpn), and 2 ng/μl Marker V (Roche Diagnostics K.K.,
Tokyo, Jpn) were loaded in every fifth lane. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained in 500 ml of 1:1,000 dilution of
SYBR Green 1 (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME, USA) in 1×
TAE for 30 minutes and scanned using a Molecular Imager
FX (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Tokyo, Jpn). The gel image
was analyzed using Image 3.9d software [52,53], followed by
FPC v.6.0 software [29,30].

RFLP linkage analysis
Southern blotting was used to assign EST clones to linkage
groups. After sequencing and homology search [22], unique
clones were amplified by PCR with plasmid-specific primers
to encompass the inserts such as M13 reverse or T3/M13M3,
M13M4, or T7 primer sets. Amplified EST DNA was labeled
using the ECL Direct Nucleic Acid Labeling and Detection
System (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech). BC1 segregants
from a single female informative pair mating ([p50T ×
C108T] female × C108T male) were used for analysis of linkage, using 16 samples per probe. When the DNA of a sample
was used up a new sample was taken from the same family
and assayed with a reference set of anchor loci to determine
the inheritance pattern for each linkage group [13]. To test
polymorphism, digestion was carried out on 2.4 μg parental
DNA with one of six restriction enzymes, BamHI, BglII,
EcoRI, HindIII, KpnI, or SacI, and subjected to 0.8 % agarose
gel electrophoresis for 16 hours at 14°C. Gel treatment for
denaturation, depurination, neutralization, blotting onto
nylon membranes (nylon membranes, positively charged;
Roche Diagnostics K. K., Tokyo, Jpn), and probe labeling and
hybridization were performed in exact accordance with the

manufacturer's instructions. Selection of suitable enzymes to
detect the RFLPs between the two parents and the analysis of
linkage in the BC1 segregants was carried out using the
