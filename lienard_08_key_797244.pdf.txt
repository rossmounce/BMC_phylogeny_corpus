Abstract
Background: Moths have evolved highly successful mating systems, relying on species-specific mixtures of sex
pheromone components for long-distance mate communication. Acyl-CoA desaturases are key enzymes in the
biosynthesis of these compounds and to a large extent they account for the great diversity of pheromone
structures in Lepidoptera. A novel desaturase gene subfamily that displays Δ11 catalytic activities has been
highlighted to account for most of the unique pheromone signatures of the taxonomically advanced ditrysian
species. To assess the mechanisms driving pheromone evolution, information is needed about the signalling
machinery of primitive moths. The currant shoot borer, Lampronia capitella, is the sole reported primitive nonditrysian moth known to use unsaturated fatty-acid derivatives as sex-pheromone. By combining biochemical and
molecular approaches we elucidated the biosynthesis paths of its main pheromone component, the (Z,Z)-9,11tetradecadien-1-ol and bring new insights into the time point of the recruitment of the key Δ11-desaturase gene
subfamily in moth pheromone biosynthesis.
Results: The reconstructed evolutionary tree of desaturases evidenced two ditrysian-specific lineages (the Δ11
and Δ9 (18C>16C)) to have orthologs in the primitive moth L. capitella despite being absent in Diptera and other
insect genomes. Four acyl-CoA desaturase cDNAs were isolated from the pheromone gland, three of which are
related to Δ9-desaturases whereas the fourth cDNA clusters with Δ11-desaturases. We demonstrated that this
transcript (Lca-KPVQ) exclusively accounts for both steps of desaturation involved in pheromone biosynthesis.
This enzyme possesses a Z11-desaturase activity that allows transforming the palmitate precursor (C16:0) into
(Z)-11-hexadecenoic acid and the (Z)-9-tetradecenoic acid into the conjugated intermediate (Z,Z)-9,11tetradecadienoic acid.
Conclusion: The involvement of a single Z11-desaturase in pheromone biosynthesis of a non-ditrysian moth
species, supports that the duplication event leading to the origin of the Lepidoptera-specific Δ11-desaturase gene
subfamily took place before radiation of ditrysian moths and their divergence from other heteroneuran lineages.
Our findings uncover that this novel class of enzymes affords complex combinations of unique unsaturated fatty
acyl-moieties of variable chain-lengths, regio- and stereo-specificities since early in moth history and contributes
a notable innovation in the early evolution of moth-pheromones.

Background
The Lepidoptera, comprising the moths and butterflies
[1], represent the second largest lineage of plant-feeding
organisms and among all insect orders they seem to have
radiated most recently [2]. Moths, including 95% of the
extant lepidopteran species have evolved an efficient
mate-communication system based on volatile sex phe-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/270

romones produced by females. The vast majority of the
higher Lepidoptera -the so-called Ditrysia (Fig 1)- uses
unique blends of long-chain unsaturated alcohols, acetates or aldehydes in order to attract conspecific males
over long distances [3,4]. These pheromones are produced
in specialized pheromone glands located along the
intersegmental membrane between the terminal abdomi-

to mating and/or oviposition, respectively [1]. The taxonomic position of Lampronia capitella is indicated with an asterisk (*).

nal segments VIII and IX [5]. These pheromone compounds are biosynthesized from saturated fatty-acid
precursors along pathways involving a few discrete enzymatic reactions including the introduction of double
bonds by specific desaturases, limited chain-shortening
reactions and the formation of an oxygenated functional
group (e.g., [6-9]).
An important step in insect pheromone biosynthesis is
the involvement of specific desaturases introducing double bonds at specific positions in the fatty-acyl chain by
removing two hydrogen atoms [7-10]. Insect desaturases
are homologous to the ancestral Δ9 acyl-CoA desaturases
of plants, vertebrates and fungi and are functioning as part
of a multienzyme complex residing in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) [11-14]. Certain moth desaturase lineages
are believed to have arisen subsequently to the divergence
of Lepidoptera and Diptera that took place around 300
million years ago (MYA) [10,15] and may have played a
significant role in the evolution of sex-pheromones in
Lepidoptera. Interestingly, the biosynthesis of many ditrysian oxygenated pheromones proceeds with various Δ11desaturation reactions [7,15,16]. Up to this date desaturase-encoding genes have been investigated in a dozen ditrysian moths, depicting examples of elaborate evolution
in which a minimal number of enzymes account for the
chemical diversity and species-specificity of pheromone
components found among different species [17-32].
Only a few primitive moth species have so far been investigated considering their chemical communication. Their
pheromones are made of short-chain alcohols and
ketones and release through sternal globular glands
whose openings are located on the Vth abdominal segment [33-35]. The modern distal female abdominal gland
and the typical ditrysian calling postures likely arose prior
to divergence of the Ditrysia as a few examples are known
in some monotrysian Heteroneura [reviewed in [36] and
[37]]. However, the exact localization of distal gland producing-pheromone in non-ditrysian Heteroneura remains
to be determined. Likewise, the origin of the ditrysian sexpheromone, i.e., the emergence of mating-signals derived
from saturated long-chain fatty acids and involving genes
(e.g., desaturases) specific for pheromone production,
remains obscure although it has been suggested to originate in a moth lineage prior to the divergence of Ditrysia
and the other Heteroneura lineages [36,38] (Fig. 1).
Recently, long-chain unsaturated pheromone components were identified from the abdominal tip in a moth
species outside the Ditrysia; the sex pheromone of the currant shoot borer, Lampronia capitella (Incurvarioidea: Prodoxidae), was characterized as a mixture of (Z,Z)-9,11tetradecadienol, and the corresponding acetate and aldehyde [37]. This monotrysian species constitutes the most
primitive moth for which long-chain unsaturated phe-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/270

romone components have been evidenced and provides a
unique opening for investigating evolutionary aspects of
the ditrysian pheromone mating-signals.
In this study we report on pheromone-gland precursor
identification, molecular characterization and functional
expression of desaturase transcripts from the pheromone
gland of L. capitella, of which a functional Δ11-desaturase
transcript that exhibits all of the required biochemical
activities to biosynthesize the conjugated chemical structures of the major sex pheromone component. Our findings evidence that the novel desaturase lineages, (Δ9
(18C>16C) and Δ11) evolved before the split between the
ditrysian and other heteroneuran moth lineages. By extension, our findings suggest that the specific biosynthetic
functions inherited from early moth history and which
contributed to structural variations in mating-signals may
have played a role in the radiation of the higher Lepidoptera.

Results
Fatty-acid pheromone precursor identification
Methanolyzed samples of abdominal tips from L. capitella
were prepared and analysed by GC-MS. In addition to the
saturated fatty-acid methyl esters from C8 to C20 and the
common unsaturated esters Z9–18:Me; Z9,Z12–18:Me;
Z9,Z12,Z15–18:Me and Z9–16:Me, the esters identified
also included Z9–14:Me, Z11–14:Me, E11–14:Me, Z11–
16:Me and a methyl tetradecadienoate (Fig 2). Z9–12:Me
was not detected either in FAME- or in DMDS-adduct
analyses. Monounsaturated methyl esters exhibited the
expected diagnostic ions at m/z 74, M+, M+ -31, M+ -32,
M+-74 (C16:1 = 268, 237, 236, 194; C14:1 = 240, 209,
208, 166, respectively) at expected retention times. GCMS analyses of DMDS derivatives of a methanolyzed sample confirmed the identification of Z9-monoenes by
detection of the characteristic ion at m/z 217 at expected
retention times (data not shown). DMDS adducts of the
Z11–16:Me, Z11–14:Me and E11–14:Me exhibited the
characteristic ion at m/z 245 as shown in Fig. 2.

The double-bond positions of the methyl tetradecadienoate were identified as 9,11 by analysis of its MTAD
derivatives that exhibited the diagnostic ions at m/z 351
(M+), 194 and 322. The presence of a methyl 11,13-hexadecadienoate was also found (data not shown), exhibiting
diagnostic MTAD adducts at m/z 379 (M+), 194 and 350,
which can be rationalised to be formed by chain-elongation of the relatively abundant Z9,Z11–14:acyl.
When the glands were incubated with D9-Z11–16:acid for
24 hours in vivo, the label was incorporated into Z9–
14:Me (data not shown), a potential intermediate in pheromone biosynthesis, thereby indicating that Z9–14:acyl
could be produced by β-oxidation of Z11–16:acyl.

Characterization of desaturase transcripts
Total RNA was isolated from female abdominal tips of L.
capitella. In PCR reactions using the corresponding cDNA
as template and primers targeting conserved desaturase
motifs [21], 550-bp DNA fragments were amplified that
encompassed the central region of a desaturase gene.
From the DNA information provided by the central
region, four distinct transcripts were identified and their
full-length cDNA sequences subsequently cloned.

The first desaturase transcript, Lca-QPAQ spans 1,427 bp
and encompasses an ORF encoding a protein of 353 aa
residues, which shares high aa sequence similarity with
known Z9-desaturases (16C>18C), e.g., 81% with the Z9desaturase

ole1 strain. In contrast, YEpOLEX-Lca-SPVE and
YEpOLEX-Lca-GATD transformants were unable to grow
on media lacking UFAs. These results were confirmed
using distinct verified gene constructs under identical
experimental conditions. Chromatograms of methylated
fatty-acid extracts from the Lca-QPAQ transformants
showed three peaks with retention times corresponding to
Z9–14:Me, Z9–16:Me and Z9–18:Me, in a 2:62:36 ratio.
Fatty-acid methyl esters from yeast transformed with the
Z9-desaturase gene of H. assulta (YEpOLEX-Hass-KPSE,
[26]) were also prepared for use as a positive control. In
this case the transformation resulted in the production of

Z9–16:Me and Z9–18:Me, with a preference for palmitic
acid, as shown in GC-MS analyses (data not presented).
Thus Lca-QPAQ and Hass-KPSE are encoding Z9-desaturases displaying a substrate preference for palmitic acid,
which is consistent as these desaturases are phylogenetically closely related (Δ9 16C>18C cluster) (Fig. 4). Double-bond position in the reaction products was confirmed
by analyses of DMDS derivatives, which exhibited the
characteristic fragment at m/z 217 at expected retention
times (data not shown). No distinctive products were
detected in FAME or MTAD analyses after incubation of
yeasts transformed with any of the YEpOLEX-Lca-constructs in the presence of Z11–14:Me.

Since the Lca-KPVQ transcript could not be expressed in
the pYES2.1 system (Invitrogen) neither in the InvSc1 nor
in the ole1 yeast strains, the Lca-KPVQ ORF was ligated
into a copper-inducible pYEX expression vector [39] to
assess its desaturase activity and then transformed into a
desaturase- and elongase-deficient mutant ole1 elo1 yeast
strain [40]. GC-MS analyses of fatty-acid methyl esters
from a recombinant yeast cell line grown in presence of
Cu2+ showed that the encoded protein produced a broad
range of monounsaturated products. Transformed cells
produced Z11–14:Me, Z11–16:Me, Z11–18:Me and Z11–
20:Me in a 1:48:36:15 ratio. GC-MS analyses of DMDS
derivatives prepared from the yeast transformants exhibited the characteristic fragment for a double-bond position between C11-C12 at m/z 245 (Fig. 5A). All monoene
products showed Z11 stereospecifity and no E11 isomers
were found among DMDS derivatives. Besides Z11monounsaturated acid products, cells supplemented with
Z9–14:Me had produced a conjugated C14 dienoate as
further confirmed by analyses of MTAD derivatives (Fig.

Desaturases as key factor for pheromone evolution
There is no single explanation for the evolutionary and
ecological success of Lepidoptera but it is rather thought
to be the result of a cascade of successful evolutionary
innovations [2]. The recruitment of certain lineages of
desaturase genes to serve in pheromone biosynthesis
might be one of these innovations that have played a significant role in the evolution of Lepidoptera, setting the
scene for the development of a very effective mate-communication system [10,38]. The radiation of the Lepidoptera took off about 125 MYA, approximately at the time
when the Ditrysia diverged from other heteroneuran Lep-

idoptera [2]. This evolutionary event appears to coincide
with the emergence of a novel pheromone communication system, characterized by the involvement of novel
desaturases in the production of long-chain unsaturated
fatty-acid derivatives as pheromone components. In particular, Δ11-desaturases contributed significantly to the
biosynthesis of a broad range of unsaturated pheromone
components in ditrysian species and strongly increased
the structural diversity of pheromone precursors [6-8]. In
this study we demonstrate the involvement of a Δ11desaturase in the pheromone biosynthesis in a non-ditrysian moth, Lampronia capitella (Incurvarioidea, Prodoxidae), which strongly supports the interpretation that the
recruitment of the specialized desaturases to serve in the
production of moth pheromone components occurred in
the early evolution of Lepidoptera, before their extensive
radiation.

Involvement of a Δ11-desaturase gene in mate signalling in
the primitive monotrysian moth L. capitella
We explored the potential pathways leading to the production of Z9,Z11–14:OH and the corresponding aldehyde and acetate, which are known pheromone
components in L. capitella (Fig. 6). The absence of Z9–
12:acyl excluded the possibility of having two successive
interactions of a Δ9-desaturase in the pheromone biosynthesis and the observed fatty-acid profile was found compatible with all three hypothetical pathways shown in Fig.
6. Due to the occurrence of relatively large amounts of
Z11–16:acyl in the gland and the confirmed possible
chain-shortening of this intermediate to Z9–14:acyl, a scenario was eligible (pathway a in Fig. 6) that involves Δ11desaturation of palmitic acid as an initial step in pheromone biosynthesis then followed by Δ11-desaturation of
Z9–14:acyl.

Four full-length desaturase encoding cDNAs were characterized from the L. capitella abdominal tip and their
deduced amino acid sequences notably revealed the three
histidine-rich motifs (HIS boxes) that are characteristic of
membrane-bound desaturases [13]. The Lca-QPAQ, LcaSPVE and Lca-GATD transcripts shared high homologies
with known Δ9-desaturases while the fourth transcript
(Lca-KPVQ) showed a high amino acid sequence similarity with several Δ10, Δ11 and bifunctional desaturases
from ditrysian moth species. Sequence analysis evidenced
that the isolated transcript represented a typical fatty-acyl
desaturase gene. Its predicted primary protein structure
(Fig. 3) shared several key features with other known
insect desaturases, like the position and the length of the
transmembrane domains relative to the conserved HIS
boxes and the xxxQ signature motif according to a desaturase-nomenclature previously proposed [15]. A reconstruction of the evolutionary history of desaturase genes
(Fig. 4) finally indicated this candidate desaturase to cluster with members of the Δ11-desaturase lineage.

in a desaturase- and elongase-deficient yeast strain was
performed and analyses of the unsaturated fatty-acid profiles of pYEX-Lca-KPVQ-expressing transformants established that the gene product displayed a Z11-desaturase
activity with relatively broad substrate specificity. Saturated substrates from C8 to C22 occur naturally in the ole
1 elo1 yeast strain and the gene-product catalysed the
removal of two hydrogen atoms from C14, C16, C18 and
C20, with a strong substrate preference for palmitic acid
(C16) as shown in Fig. 5A. This enzyme is also the first
insect Δ11-desaturase reported to act on the C20:acyl substrate. After complete GC-MS analysis of both yeast methanolyzed extracts and their DMDS derivatives, the Z
configuration of the double bond was confirmed in all
newly formed unsaturated substrates and no E isomers

were detected. Two Δ11-desaturases (Ostrinia sp., GenBank acc nos. AAL32060 and AAL35331) were characterized that produced Z-isomers of C16 and C18 acyl
precursors in addition to Z and E isomers of C14 acyl precursors that were later converted into the active pheromone compounds [21]. Though trans-unsaturated
pheromone components are not utilized by L. capitella,
minor amounts of E11–14:Me were detected in DMDS
analyses of FAMEs from female abdominal tips. This was
not confirmed in vitro, which might be due to the limits of
detection and does not alter the above evidences of an
active Δ11-gene.
After supplementation with excess of Z9–14:Me, the yeast
produced small amounts of the conjugated Z9,Z11-tetradecadienoate, which was detected upon GC-MS analyses
of the cis MTAD-adduct (Fig. 5B). In presence of large
amounts of both pheromone biosynthetic intermediates
(i.e., the 16:acyl and the Z9–14:acyl), the Lca-KPVQ transcript always preferentially catalyzed the formation of the
Z11–16:acyl monounsaturated intermediate.
Δ9-stearyl-CoA desaturases are primordial enzymes regulating the level of unsaturated fatty-acid biosynthesis and
thereby allowing living organisms to maintain the physical structure and fluidity of membrane lipid bilayers [4244]. When transforming yeasts with YEpOLEX-Lca-SPVE
or YEpOLEX-Lca-GATD constructs, the Δ9 desaturase
activity of the ole1 yeast strain could not be restored. Δ9desaturases (18C>16C) exist that catalyse the formation
of Z9-monoenes in the pheromone gland of some ditrysian moth species [19-21,23,25]; although in most cases
pheromone biosynthesis does not involve Δ9 desaturation [10]. It is also not uncommon to encounter inactive
desaturase transcripts as exemplified by two Lca-GATD
paralogs, the HassGATD transcript that was found to be
non-functional in pheromone biosynthesis in H. assulta
[26] or the CpaZ9GATD (C14-C26) transcript that produced a long series of monounsaturated fatty acids in C.
parallela, an activity that could however not be linked to
sex-pheromone biosynthesis [25]. It might then be envisioned that both Lca-SPVE and Lca-GATD are catalytically
inactive desaturases in this moth species and as previously
suggested, could represent pseudogenes or encode other
functions yet to be determined [10,24,28]. Analyses of
esterified total-lipid extracts of YEpOLEX-Lca-QPAQtransformed yeast revealed that the gene product was producing a series of Z9-monoenes with a preference for palmitic acid like other Δ9 16C>18C insect-desaturases (Fig.
4). The Z9–14:acyl, intermediate in the pheromone biosynthesis (pathway b, Fig. 6), accounted for 2% of the
total amount of UFAs produced and could thus be formed
by the Lca-Z9-QPAQ desaturase. However, topical application of labelled precursors indicated that the D9-Z11–
16:acyl is also significantly incorporated into Z9–14:acyl.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/270

Knowing that the Z11–16:acyl is produced by Δ11-desaturation and that significant chain-shortening occurs in the
gland, it is more likely that the Z9–14:acyl derives from βoxidation of the Z11–16:acyl precursor. The Lca-Z9QPAQ desaturase is most likely not involved in the pathway b of pheromone production. Besides, no conjugated
Z9,Z11–14:acyl could be detected from Lca-Z9-QPAQ
yeasts transformants grown in presence of Z11–14:Me
and this transcript is therefore not involved in the Δ9desaturation reaction proposed in the pathway c (Fig. 6).
In conclusion, our in vitro analyses indicate that the LcaZ11-KPVQ transcript encodes a functional protein displaying enzymatic properties consistent with the proposed pheromone biosynthetic pathway of L. capitella
(pathway a, Fig. 6). While the first Z11-desaturation step
on palmitic acid is a prevalent reaction that has been characterized in several other ditrysian moth species (see e.g.,
[17,26,27]), the Δ11-desaturase activity on monoene precursors has been evidenced in only a few moth species up
to date. In E. postvittana, an E11-desaturase catalyses the
formation of E9,E11–14:acid from E9–14:acid [24] while
in B. mori, Manduca sexta and S. littoralis bifunctional Δ11
and Δ10,12-desaturases catalyse the formation of conjugated Δ10,12 dienes from Z11-monounsaturated precursors [27,29,31].
Insights into the origin of the Δ11-desaturase subfamily
Any gene in any genome is selectively constrained and
most mutations that change the fitness of an organism are
expected to be deleterious [45-47]. Gene duplications represent major opportunities that contribute to functional
novelties in all living organisms thereby playing a vital
role during evolution [47,48] and the predominant
motive during the evolution of a novel gene function is to
gain a selective advantage [45]. The need for efficient mate
signalling and species-specific recognition might have
been a strong motive for establishment of new functions
within pheromone communication as derived from
duplicated genes. The pheromone-desaturase family most
likely originated in a common ancestor of Diptera and
Lepidoptera before their divergence in the early Carboniferous, i.e., between 330 and 350 MYA [49]. Several extant
flies hence use orthologs of the Δ9 (16C>18C) group (Fig.
4)-which represents the metabolic ancestral function of
the gene family [10,15]- for synthesizing cuticular-hydrocarbon sex-pheromones [9,50]. Subsequently the lepidopteran desaturase gene family evolved under a birthand-death evolutionary process and underwent several
duplication events leading to five well-supported clades
[10,21,51] (Fig. 4). Reconstructing the evolutionary history of desaturase genes shows that only the Δ11 and the
Δ9 (18C>16C) lineages have no orthologous genes in any
Dipteran genome examined to date (Fig. 4), which suggests that the genes were either lost in Diptera subsequent

Page 9 of 15

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:270

to the divergence of moths and flies or that both lineages
may have been recruited following a duplication point
succeeding the divergence between Diptera and Lepidoptera [10,21]. We have examined the evolution of desaturases using predicted genes available from other insect
orders including Hymenoptera, Hemiptera and Coleoptera (see additional File 1) and we found no evidence for
orthologous genes of the Δ11 and Δ9 (18C>16C lineages)
in these insect orders. Both desaturase lineages are thus
most likely innovations of lepidopterans, of which the
Δ11-desaturase lineage exclusively serves in the pheromone production. Our molecular and functional investigations of pheromone biosynthetic genes in L. capitella
strongly indicate that the duplication events that gave rise
to both desaturase-gene lineages took place before the
divergence of Heteroneura lineages from Ditrysia, around
125 MYA. The alternative explanation that both duplications occurred independently in two different lineages is a
less parsimonious explanation.
Clearly, the emergence and establishment of the Δ11desaturase subfamily in moth genomes might have promoted structural diversity among pheromones early in the
evolution of Lepidoptera. Whether the duplication events
took place before or after the divergence of Lepidoptera
and its sister group Trichoptera will be interesting to
investigate. In this context it would be of interest to find
out whether Δ9- or Δ11-desaturases (or another desaturase function yet unidentified) underlie the double-bond
formation in the biosynthesis of (Z)-4-hepten-2-ol and
(Z)-6-nonen-2-ol (and their corresponding ketones) as
observed in Eriocraniidae moths and in Trichoptera. Both
compounds could hypothetically be produced by Δ11desaturation of tetradecanoate, followed by chain shortening by successive steps of β-oxidation and finally decarboxylation [38]. Investigating pheromone biosynthesis in
these more primitive non-ditrysian moth lineages will further highlight to what extent the recruitment of discrete
pheromone production genes contributed to the emergence of the typical ditrysian moth signalling chemistry
and by extension promoted the adaptive success of the
Lepidoptera.
Likewise, the exact location of the distal pheromone-producing cells and their morphological features in Monotrysia should also be investigated. Such an investigation
could resolve the intriguing issue whether the pheromone-producing desaturases in monotrysian moths are catalysing the formation of biosynthetic precursors in a
pheromone gland structure alike those of most ditrysian
species or within -a yet uncharacterized internal structureof the abdominal tip.

Conclusion
The renowned sexual communication of Lepidoptera has
likely evolved through a combination of mechanisms
[2,36] involving the diversification of female-produced
chemical signals that mediate mate attraction and corresponding changes in male responses to these signals [52].
Variation in pheromone-biosynthetic genes have been
supported for promoting changes in the emitted signals
thereby indirectly directing major adaptations in moth
mate-recognition systems [53]. A core component of the
evolution of moth chemistry has been evidenced that
imply gene duplications of biosynthetic genes and their
maintenance in the insect genomes [10,15]. We here
brought evidence that Lepidoptera-specific pheromoneproduction desaturase genes evolved before radiation of
the ditrysian lineages. Especially, a Δ11-desaturase (LcaKPVQ) was shown catalyzing key reactions leading to
mono- and di-unsaturated fatty acyl-moieties in the primitive moth Lampronia capitella, the sole non-ditrysian species identified to date that relies on long-chain diunsaturated fatty-acid derivatives for mate-attraction. Like
many other characterized ditrysian-moth desaturases, LcaKPVQ catalyses a few more desaturation reactions in vitro
than those leading to the biologically relevant components used by L. capitella. This supports the current view
that subtle alterations in enzymatic activities at different
levels in the biosynthesis may have lead to subtle shifts in
pheromones and ultimately to new species-specific communication channels [15,21]. Recruiting Δ11-desaturases
in mate signalling prior to the extensive lepidopteran radiation may thus have contributed, as part of a complex biological framework, to the evolution of the typical moth
pheromone chemistry and supports the hypothesis that a
limited number of biosynthetic genes played a pivotal
role in ditrysian moth evolution.

Methods
Insect collection
Immature larvae were collected in a black currant (Ribes
nigrum) orchard in mid-May in Sörfors, northwest of
Umeå (Västerbotten, Sweden). Infested branches were
cut, brought to the laboratory and kept at 15°C until the
larvae had pupated. Pupae were separated from branches
or folded leaves and were maintained at 23°C in 60% relative humidity and in a 17:7 hours light:dark photoperiod.
Application of labelled precursors
Virgin 0 to 2 day-old female moths were used for topical
application of labelled precursors onto the abdominal tip.
In the early photophase, individual calling females were
anaesthetized using carbon dioxide and the abdomen was
then gently squeezed in order to completely expose the
abdominal tip. D9-Z11–16:acid (4 μg in 0.2 μl DMSO)
was topically applied onto the abdominal tip and the

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:270

solution was allowed to be absorbed by the gland during
a few minutes. Females were reintroduced into individual
cages for 24 hours. Abdominal tips from 10 females
(including ovipositor) were then carefully dissected under
a stereomicroscope and extraction of pheromone components was performed for 1 hour in a glass capillary containing 80 μl hexane.
Base methanolysis
For analysis of fatty-acid methyl esters, a total lipid extraction was performed using chloroform:methanol (2:1 v/v).
Base methanolysis was then utilized to convert fatty-acyl
moieties into the corresponding methyl esters. Abdominal tip tissues were removed and the solvent was evaporated under a gentle N2 stream. Concentrated extracts were
treated with 100 μl 0.5 M KOH/methanol and allowed to
react for 1 hour at room temperature. For base methanolysis of total lipid yeast extracts, yeast residues were directly
treated with 500 μl 0.5 M KOH/methanol after solvent
evaporation [17]. Abdominal tip samples or yeast extracts
were acidified by addition of 100 or 500 μl 1.0 M HCl,
respectively and the resulting fatty-acid methyl esters
(FAME) were collected in hexane, and analysed by GC-MS
analysis.
Determination of double bond positions by DMDS and
MTAD
Methanolyzed extracts were converted into dimethyldisulfide (DMDS) derivatives by addition of 50 μl DMDS
and 5 μl iodine 5% in diethyl ether and then incubated
over night at 40°C. Two hundred μl of hexane were added
to the sample and the reaction was neutralized by addition of 20 to 50 μl Na2S2O3 5% [54]. The organic phase
was removed, concentrated under a gentle N2 stream and
subjected to GC-MS analysis. The 4-methyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione (MTAD) adducts were prepared by transferring 5 μl of the methyl ester extracts into a glass vial
containing 10 μl CH2Cl2 and treating the resulting solution with 10 μl of a MTAD solution (2 μg/μl; in CH2Cl2).
Reactions were incubated for 15 min at room temperature
and 2 μl were subjected to GC-MS analysis [55].
Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses
Samples were analysed on a gas chromatograph (GC)
(Hewlett Packard HP 6890 GC system) equipped with an
auto-injector (HP 7683) and coupled to a mass selective
detector (HP 5973). The GC was equipped with an HP1MS column (100% methyl siloxane; 30 m 3 0.25 mm, df:
0.25 μm) and helium was used as carrier gas (velocity: 32
cm/s). For FAME and DMDS analyses, the oven temperature was set to 55°C (or 80°C) for 2 min, then increased
by 10°C/min up to 250°C, followed by a hold at 250°C
for 10 min, and then increased by 20°C/min up to 300°C
followed by a hold at 300°C for 5 min. For MTAD adduct
analyses, the injector temperature was set to 300°C, the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/270

oven temperature was set to 100°C and then increased by
15°C/min up to 300°C followed by a hold at 300°C for
20 min according to procedures previously described [55].
FAME synthesis
(11Z)-Tetradeca-11-en-1-ol and (9Z,11E)- and (9Z,11Z)tetradeca-9,11-dien-1-ols (12–115 mg), respectively, were
oxidised at 0°C with Jones reagent according to [56] followed by acid-catalysed esterification of the resulting acid
in methanol at room temperature.
Total RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
Abdominal tips were carefully dissected from 50 virgin
female moths on the first day after their emergence,
immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
-80°C. Total RNA was isolated and purified from abdominal tips using the Trizol® reagent (Invitrogen™ Life technologies) according to recommended procedures. One μg
of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using
Stratascript (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's
protocol.
PCR screening and cloning of pheromone desaturaseencoding cDNAs
Abdominal tip cDNA was used as template for PCR amplification using the primers PR3 and PR4 (Table 1) designed
based on the highly conserved GAHR and EGFH histidine-rich motifs identified in other insect desaturases
[21]. PCR reactions were performed in a PCR GeneAmp
9700 Thermo Cycler (Applied Biosystems) using the
AmpliTaq Golds chemistry (Applied Biosystems). The following temperatures were used for cycling: 94°C for 4
min followed by 30 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s
and 72°C for 1 min 30 s followed by a final step at 72°C
for 40 min, to ensure complete extension of all products
to maximize TA cloning. Amplification products were
analysed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. Expected 550 bp-amplification products were excised from the gel, purified using
the Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and then ligated to
TOPO® TA PCR 2.1 vector (Invitrogen). The ligation mixtures were used to transform E. coli TOPO 10 competent
cells (Invitrogen). Plasmids were purified using standard
protocols and plasmid DNAs were subjected to sequencing reaction using the Big Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit v1.1 (Applied Biosystems) followed by analysis on
a capillary ABI 3100 sequencer instrument (Applied Biosystems). Sequence information was obtained in both forward and reverse directions and the curated consensus
sequences were used for database searches to verify the
identity of the isolated central gene fragments. Based on
the central sequence information, gene-specific primers
(GSPs, Table 1) were designed to PCR-amplify the 3'-and
the 5'-cDNA terminal regions using the RACE SMART Kit
(Clontech). PCR amplifications were performed accord-

5'and 3' PCR products were cloned and sequenced as

designed for the PCR amplification of the entire DNA
region representing each gene. Obtained PCR products

were cloned and sequenced to verify the integrity of each
desaturase gene.
DNA sequences were analysed using Sequencher V.3.0

Sequence analyses and Neighbour-Joining tree
construction
Comparison of sequence information to publicly available DNA information was performed using BLAST [58].
Multiple sequence alignments were performed using the
Clustal W 18.2 algorithm [59] and edited in BOXSHADE
[60]. Prediction of the endoplasmic retention signal was
performed using PSORT [61]. Desaturase aa sequences
used for phylogenetic reconstructions were retrieved from
the GenBank non-redundant (nr) protein database [62]
and the Neighbour-Joining tree was constructed using
MEGA version 3.1 [63].
Functional assay of Δ9-desaturases by complementation in
mutant yeast using the expression vector YEpOLEX
Gene-specific primers including XbaI and SacI restriction
sites (Table 1) were designed based on the ORFs identified
for each of the three Δ9-like desaturase transcripts. After
PCR amplification from abdominal tip cDNA, PCR products were purified by standard procedures followed by
trimming by double restriction digestion using XbaI and
SacI. Digestion products were purified by gel electrophoresis followed by gel elution and then directionally
inserted by replacement cloning in the linearized
YEpOLEX plasmid [17]. After verification by DNA
sequencing, the final recombinant plasmids were designated YEpOLEX-Lca-QPAQ, YEpOLEX-Lca-SPVE and
YEpOLEX-Lca-GATD and used for transformation of a
desaturase-deficient yeast strain (MATα ole1::LEU2 leu2–3
leu2–112 trp1-1 ura3–52 his4) [12]. The YEpOLEX-HassKPSE plasmid construct from Helicoverpa assulta [26] was
used as a positive control. For selection of uracil prototrophs, transformed yeasts were plated on selective
medium containing 0.7% YNB and a drop-out medium
lacking uracil and leucine (ForMedium™), 2% glucose, 0.5
mM palmitoleic acid, 0.5 mM oleic acid (Larodan, Sweden), 1% tergitol (type Nonidet NP-40, Sigma) and
0.01% adenine (Sigma). Individual uracil prototroph colonies were transferred to YPAD plates for complementation of the UFA auxotrophy of the ole1 yeast strain used.
UFA prototrophs were inoculated in 10 ml YPAD medium
with or without Z11–14:Me and incubated at 30°C and
300 rpm for 48 hours. Cells were collected by centrifugation and cell pellets were washed with sterile water three
times and then processed for FAME analyses. The doublebond positions of FAMEs were determined by GC-MS
analysis of DMDS adducts.
Functional assay of a Δ11-desaturase by complementation
in mutant yeast using the expression vector pYEX-CHT
The pYEX-CHT expression vector [39] was used for functional assay in combination with the double deficient ole1
elo1 S. cerevisiae strain (MATa elo1::HIS3 ole1::LEU2 ade2
his3 leu2 ura3), defective in both desaturase and elongase
gene functions [40]. This expression vector is derived from

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/270

the pYEX plasmid (ClonTech), and is related to the vector
used for assaying the biochemical activity of the Δ11desaturase in S. littoralis and Thaumetopoea pityocampa
[29,30]. Two gene-specific primers, Lc4ORFs and
Lc4ORFas (Table 1) encompassing the BamH1 and EcoR1
restriction sites were designed to amplify Lca-KPVQ ORF
using the Advantage®2 PCR enzyme system (Clontech),
which was then ligated into the TOPO® TA PCR 2.1 vector
(Invitrogen) and the construct was transformed into
TOPO 10 cells. The insert was amplified, purified,
released from plasmid by BamH1 and EcoR1 restriction
digestion and subcloned into the BamH1 and EcoR1 cloning sites of the linearized pYEX vector. Constructs were
transformed into TOPO 10 cells and analysed by sequencing. The final construct designated pYEX-Lca-KPVQ was
transformed for functional expression into the ole1 elo1
yeast. pYEX-Lca-KPVQ yeast transformants were grown on
selective medium as described above for 4 days at 30°C.
Individual transformants were then isolated and inoculated in 10 ml YPAD medium containing 1 mM CuSO4
and grown for 48 hours at 30°C and 300 rpm. Cells were
harvested by centrifugation and then suspended in fresh
YPAD medium containing 1 mM CuSO4 with or without
addition of Z9–14:Me (Larodan, Sweden). The cells were
subsequently incubated for 48 hours, collected by centrifugation and then washed with water. Fatty-acid methyl
esters were extracted and analysed by GC-MS. The position of double bonds in monoenes and dienes was determined by DMDS and MTAD derivatizations, followed by
GC-MS analysis.
