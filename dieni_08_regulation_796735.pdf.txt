Abstract
Background: The wood frog, Rana sylvatica, is one of a few vertebrate species that have developed
natural freeze tolerance, surviving days or weeks with 65–70% of its total body water frozen in
extracellular ice masses. Frozen frogs exhibit no vital signs and their organs must endure multiple
stresses, particularly long term anoxia and ischemia. Maintenance of cellular energy supply is critical
to viability in the frozen state and in skeletal muscle, AMP deaminase (AMPD) plays a key role in
stabilizing cellular energetics. The present study investigated AMPD control in wood frog muscle.
Results: Wood frog AMPD was subject to multiple regulatory controls: binding to subcellular
structures, protein phosphorylation, and effects of allosteric effectors, cryoprotectants and
temperature. The percentage of bound AMPD activity increased from 20 to 35% with the transition
to the frozen state. Bound AMPD showed altered kinetic parameters compared with the free
enzyme (S0.5 AMP was reduced, Hill coefficient fell to ~1.0) and the transition to the frozen state
led to a 3-fold increase in S0.5 AMP of the bound enzyme. AMPD was a target of protein
phosphorylation. Bound AMPD from control frogs proved to be a low phosphate form with a low
S0.5 AMP and was phosphorylated in incubations that stimulated PKA, PKC, CaMK, or AMPK.
Bound AMPD from frozen frogs was a high phosphate form with a high S0.5 AMP that was reduced
under incubation conditions that stimulated protein phosphatases. Frog muscle AMPD was
activated by Mg·ATP and Mg·ADP and inhibited by Mg·GTP, KCl, NaCl and NH4Cl. The enzyme
product, IMP, uniquely inhibited only the bound (phosphorylated) enzyme from muscle of frozen
frogs. Activators and inhibitors differentially affected the free versus bound enzyme. S0.5 AMP of
bound AMPD was also differentially affected by high versus low assay temperature (25 vs 5°C) and
by the presence/absence of the natural cryoprotectant (250 mM glucose) that accumulates during
freezing.
Conclusion: Maintenance of long term viability under the ischemic conditions in frozen muscle
requires attention to the control of cellular energetics. Differential regulatory controls on AMPD
by mechanisms including binding to muscle proteins, actions allosteric effectors, glucose and
temperature effects and reversible phosphorylation adjust enzyme function for an optimal role in
controlling cellular adenylate levels in ischemic frozen muscle. Stable modification of AMPD
properties via freeze-responsive phosphorylation may contribute both to AMPD control and to
coordinating AMPD function with other enzymes of energy metabolism in cold ischemic muscle.

Background
Seasonal temperatures below 0°C are a major challenge to
viability for terrestrial ectotherms around the world. In
many cases, biochemical adaptations supplying cold tolerance are key to winter survival [1,2]. For many species,
cold tolerance includes the ability to endure the freezing
of body fluids and, among vertebrates, this capacity has
been best-studied in a species that hibernates on the forest
floor, the wood frog, Rana sylvatica (also known as Lithobates sylvaticus) [3]. Prominent adaptations that underlie
wood frog freeze tolerance include the accumulation and
distribution of huge amounts of glucose as a colligative
cryoprotectant [4-7], the synthesis of ice-nucleating proteins [8], selective up-regulation of a variety of freezeresponsive genes [9], and metabolic rate depression
[10,11].
The freezing of 65–70% of total body water in extracellular and extra-organ spaces halts heart beat and breathing
and rapidly leads to conditions of anoxia and ischemia
[3,12]. These conditions place energy stress on cells and
over time the tissues of frozen frogs build up glycolytic
end products (lactate, alanine) and deplete ATP [13]. This
reduces the Adenylate Energy Charge (AEC): AEC = ([ATP]
+ 0.5 [ADP])/([ATP] + [ADP] + [AMP]). However, viability
is aided if AEC can be maintained at a high value for as
long as possible and so mechanisms are in place, particularly in skeletal muscle, to stabilize the AEC. The action of
adenylate kinase (2 ADP ↔ ATP + AMP) allows some ATP
to be resynthesized from ADP as it accumulates but this
elevates [AMP]. However, if AMP is removed from the
adenylate pool, the AEC ratio can be kept at a high value
at the expense of an overall reduction in adenylate pool
size. This mechanism is commonly seen in working skeletal muscle and also under a variety of environmental stress
conditions that compromise energy reserves such as
hypoxia, ischemia [14,15], freezing [13] or during torpor
in hibernating mammals [16].
The removal of AMP from the adenylate pool is primarily
the function of 5'-adenosine monophosphate deaminase
(AMPD; EC 3.5.4.6) which hydrolyzes AMP to produce
inosine monophosphate (IMP) and ammonium ion
(NH4 +) [17]. AMPD action can lead to either a temporary
drain of AMP (with IMP accumulating) or to a more permanent change if IMP is channeled into catabolic pathways leading ultimately to uric acid excretion. In skeletal
muscle, the enzyme is well-known to be key to stabilizing
the AEC during high-intensity muscle work in a range of
vertebrate species [18-24]. The regulation of AMPD is
complex and includes activation or inhibition by ions and
metabolite effectors [25-27], reversible binding to myosin
[18], oligomerization [28], and covalent modification
[29]. Moreover, regulation by one of these factors can
influence subsequent control by others. For example,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/9/12

binding of AMPD to myosin subunits alleviates allosteric
inhibition of the enzyme from some sources, in addition
to influencing substrate affinity and activity [26]. Phosphorylation of AMPD, in turn, may either influence or
succeed binding, and has not yet been clearly elucidated
[20].
The present study examines the regulation of AMPD in
wood frog skeletal muscle. The enzyme from control (5°C
acclimated) and frozen animals was compared to look for
freeze-responsive changes in enzyme activity, kinetic
parameters, phosphorylation state, temperature effects,
and response to low molecular weight effectors.

Results
Activity and kinetic parameters of AMPD in crude extracts
of skeletal muscle
AMPD is known to bind to myosin and a portion of total
activity remains bound in the pellet after normal homogenization and centrifugation. The total activity of AMPD
in wood frog muscle was 22–28 U/gww and the majority
of activity was in the soluble fraction (Table 1). The percentage of AMPD in the bound form was 20.3 ± 0.13 % in
control frogs and increased significantly to 35.4 ± 0.09 %
in muscle from frozen frogs. Free AMPD showed a sigmoidal relationship between velocity and [AMP] with values
for the Hill coefficient (nH) that were 1.76 ± 0.06 in muscle extracts from control frogs and 2.76 ± 0.10 in frozen
frogs (Table 2). By contrast, bound AMPD displayed
velocity versus substrate concentration profiles that were
essentially hyperbolic (nH values of 1.03–1.12). Affinity of
free AMPD for its substrate did not change between control and frozen states. However, S0.5 AMP of the bound
enzyme was both significantly lower than the corresponding value for the free enzyme and changed between control and frozen states, S0.5 AMP of bound AMPD from

muscle of frozen frogs being 3-fold higher than the value
for control frogs.
Endogenous effectors of AMPD
Soluble fractions of crude muscle extracts were centrifuged through small columns of Sephadex G-50 to
remove ions and low molecular weight metabolites
present in the crude extract. Desalting reduced S0.5 values
for AMP by 23–35%, but values for the enzyme from control and frozen frogs remained similar (Table 3). The nH
value for AMPD from control frogs also increased significantly but was similar to the value for frozen frogs.
Allosteric effectors of AMPD
Sephadex G-50 filtered AMPD was assayed in the presence
of potential effectors, to determine if these would affect
activity. ATP only activated the free (soluble) form of
AMPD, whereas ADP activated both free and bound
enzyme forms (Table 4). The Ka ATP decreased significantly by 69% for AMPD from muscle of frozen frogs,
compared with the value for control frogs. ATP activated
AMPD from control frogs by 1.53-fold, whereas in frozen
frogs, the fold activation was 2.69. Similarly, the Ka ADP
for both free and bound forms of AMPD was lower than
the corresponding values for the enzyme from control
frogs. The Ka ADP for bound AMPD in control frogs was

significantly higher than the corresponding free value for
the enzyme from either control or frozen frogs. ADP activated free AMPD in control frogs by 2.17-fold, whereas in
frozen frogs, this increased to 5-fold. A similar increase
was noted for the bound forms of AMPD. ADP activated
bound AMPD in control frogs by 1.25-fold and this
increased to 3.42-fold in frozen frogs.
GTP was a very strong inhibitor with I50 values of just
0.08–0.15 mM (Table 5). I50 GTP of free AMPD was about
50% lower for the enzyme from frozen frogs but the value
for bound AMPD was unaffected by the transition to the
frozen state. IMP is the product of the AMPD reaction.
IMP inhibited bound AMPD from muscle of frozen frogs
with an I50 of 0.23 ± 0.02 mM but interestingly, did not
inhibit the enzyme in any other situation at the IMP concentrations tested (up to 10 mM). Salts also inhibited
AMPD; all three salts tested had Cl- as the anion so differences in inhibitory effects are due to cation effects. Na+
and K+ were very weak inhibitors of free AMPD with I50
values in the range of 650–970 mM but both cations had
much stronger effects on bound AMPD with I50 values
between 130–160 mM. NH4 +, another product of the
AMPD reaction, inhibited the free enzyme with I50 values
in the 250–275 mM range. The effects of NH4 + on the
bound enzyme could not be tested because NH4 + is the
product being measured by the GDH-coupled assay used
for the bound enzyme.
Temperature and cryoprotectant effects
AMPD activity was assayed in the presence versus absence
of glucose, the cryoprotectant that is present in high concentrations in tissues of frozen frogs. Activity was also
assessed at high (25°C) and low (5°C) temperatures.
Addition of high glucose (250 mM) significantly
decreased the S0.5 AMP for the enzyme from both control
and frozen frogs when assayed at high temperature, the
effect being particularly strong (84% reduction) for the
enzyme from frozen frogs (Table 6). In contrast, S0.5 AMP
increased significantly when the enzyme was assayed at a
cold temperature (5°C), close to the freezing temperatures when frogs would naturally experience high glucose.
The combined effects of cold temperature and high glucose together resulted in 1.9- and 1.4-fold increases in S0.5

respectively. The S0.5 AMP for AMPD from frozen frogs
under these conditions was still markedly higher (by 2.5fold) than the corresponding value for the enzyme from
control frogs.
Reversible phosphorylation
Many enzymes are targets of covalent modification by
protein kinases and protein phosphatases. To determine
whether reversible phosphorylation affected bound
AMPD, incubations were set up in which enzyme phosphorylation or dephosphorylation was promoted by stimulating the activities of endogenous protein kinases and
phosphatases. Incubations that stimulated all protein
kinases resulted in a significant 2-fold increase in S0.5 AMP
of bound AMPD from muscle of control frogs (Figure 1).
Similarly, S0.5 AMP of control AMPD increased significantly when the activities of PKA, PKC, CaMK, or AMPK
(but not PKG) were stimulated individually. However,
stimulation of these protein kinases had no effect on the
substrate affinity of AMPD from muscle of frozen frogs.

When incubations stimulated protein phosphatase activities instead the opposite effect was seen. The S0.5 AMP of
muscle AMPD from frozen frogs decreased significantly
by 49 % after stimulation of phosphatase activities. Conversely, stimulation of protein phosphatases had no

noticeable effect on S0.5 AMP of the enzyme from control
frogs.

Discussion
Freezing imposes long term ischemia upon wood frog
organs and while frozen, organ ATP levels decline and so
can the AEC [13]. Freeze-thaw cycles accelerate the decline
in AEC, and it can be expected that several freeze-thaw
cycles must be endured over a typical winter [30]. Studies
of wood frog liver and leg muscle showed decreasing
[ATP] in both organs during freezing but whereas a noticeable drop in AEC occurred in liver, no appreciable change
was noted in leg muscle over several freeze-thaw cycles.
This implies that skeletal muscle has a metabolic strategy
in place to support AEC at high values for as long as possible [30]. This strategy appears to involve the action of
AMPD in draining AMP from the muscle adenylate pool
and hence, the present study addressed the regulation of
skeletal muscle AMPD, comparing enzyme properties
from unfrozen versus frozen wood frogs.
An initial analysis of the maximum activity (Vmax) and
apparent substrate affinity (S0.5) of wood frog AMPD in
soluble extracts of skeletal muscle found no change in
these enzyme parameters between control and frozen
states (Tables 1 and 2). Removal of endogenous low
molecular weight effectors using Sephadex G50 spun col-

frozen frogs had significantly lower Ka values for ATP and
ADP and the I50 GTP was also reduced by about 50%.
Overall, then free AMPD in muscle of frozen frogs was
more sensitive to high energy phosphates than in the control state. Given that the levels of these high energy phosphates also fall in vivo in muscle during freezing, these
changes in the properties of the enzyme could possibly
maintain the relative sensitivity of the enzyme to regulatory control by high energy phosphates in the frozen state.

umns reduced the S0.5 for AMP of the free enzyme from
both control and frozen muscle by similar amounts and
altered the nH value for control AMPD (Table 3). This indicates that one or more endogenous inhibitors (e.g. GTP)
are present in crude extracts. Further analysis of the
responses by free AMPD to activators and inhibitors
showed differences between the enzyme from control and
frozen states (Tables 4 and 5). The enzyme from muscle of

A comparison of bound AMPD from muscle of control
versus frozen frogs showed that control AMPD had much
higher affinity for AMP than did the enzyme from frozen
muscle (Table 2). However, bound AMPD from frozen
frogs had a lower Ka ADP (just 30% of the value for control frogs) which would increase bound AMPD sensitivity
to the product of ATP hydrolysis in frozen muscle and
potentially link it more closely to muscle energetics. Interestingly, IMP exclusively inhibited the bound form of
AMPD from frozen frogs, but did not inhibit free forms of
the enzyme, or bound AMPD in control frogs. The unique
inhibitory effect of IMP on bound AMPD from frozen
frogs suggests that this form of the enzyme exists in a distinct state, where it can be tightly controlled by key metab-

olites (adenylates, GTP, IMP) that reflect the energy status
of skeletal muscle while frozen.
Binding to myosin is a major regulatory feature of AMPD
that has been extensively explored [18-21,26,31]. The
amount of AMPD that was bound in wood frog muscle
increased from 20% in control frogs to 35% in frozen animals suggesting that a greater association of AMPD with
myofibrils benefited metabolism in frozen muscle. This
response may be triggered by the anoxic/ischemic conditions that accrue as freezing progresses. Low oxygen stress
is known to enhance AMPD binding in muscle from other
species [14]. Indeed, Rundell et al. [31] reported that muscle AMPD remained bound as long as ischemic conditions
persisted. Bound AMPD had a greater affinity for AMP
substrate than free AMPD in both control and frozen frogs
and bound AMPD also showed hyperbolic AMP kinetics
compared with the sigmoidal relationship seen for free
AMPD. Bound AMPD was less sensitive to ADP activation
than was its comparable free form but was much more
strongly inhibited by Na+ and K+ ions in both control and
frozen frogs.
Not only is AMPD distributed between free and bound
states but myofibril-bound AMPD is also subject to covalent modification by protein kinases and phosphatases
[20]. Indeed, cardiac AMPD was phosphorylated by at
least one major protein kinase, PKC [29]. Protein kinases
and phosphatases, although often soluble, can be compartmentally restricted through anchoring and scaffolding
proteins, allowing them access to phosphorylate and
dephosphorylate bound enzymes such as AMPD [32,32].
To determine whether wood frog muscle AMPD was subject to reversible phosphorylation, preparations of bound
AMPD from control frogs were incubated under conditions that stimulated the action of endogenous protein
kinases (PKA, PKC, CaMK, or AMPK). After protein kinase
treatment, the enzyme consistently showed reduced affinity for AMP (S0.5 increased by about 2-fold) (Fig. 1). Conversely, conditions that promoted the dephosphorylation
of bound AMPD from frozen frogs caused an increase in
AMP affinity (S0.5 decreased by about half). This implies
that wood frog muscle AMPD is regulated by reversible
phosphorylation when bound, and that in the transition
from the control to frozen states, the phosphorylation
state is modified. The data are consistent with a low phosphate form of bound AMPD in control frogs and a high
phosphate form in frozen frogs and with one of the
actions of phosphorylation being to reduce the affinity of
the bound enzyme for AMP. Enhanced phosphorylation
of bound AMPD may also be responsible for other
changes in the kinetic properties of the bound enzyme
from frozen muscle such as the change in sensitivity to
ADP activation, the unique inhibition by IMP, and the
response of the enzyme to high glucose.

Freezing alters cytosolic conditions in frog cells, in particular by greatly elevating the concentrations of glucose
which acts as a cryoprotectant. Hence, effects of high glucose on enzymes need to be considered as well as potential
interactions
between
cryoprotectants
and
temperature. High concentrations of glucose increased the
substrate affinity for AMP of bound AMPD when the
enzyme was assayed at 25°C but had relatively little effect
on S0.5 at low assay temperatures. By contrast, low temperature assay at 5°C decreased AMP substrate affinity of the
enzyme from both control and frozen frogs. Overall, the
additive effects of high glucose and low temperatures led
to a substantial reduction in AMPD affinity for its substrate compared with the situation at high temperature
without glucose with increases in S0.5 AMP of 2-fold for
the bound enzyme from control frogs and ~25% for
AMPD from frozen frogs. Interestingly, both of these factors coupled together led to a combined decrease in substrate affinity of AMPD. Hence, both temperature change
and high glucose could influence the function of AMPD
between unfrozen and frozen states.
Many previous studies have focused on AMPD in working
skeletal muscle and found that the enzyme is more active
and more bound under exercising conditions. By contrast,
the present study suggests that in the frozen state, bound
AMPD is less active with reduced substrate affinity. This
agrees with a study on AMPD in muscle of hibernating
mammals that found that substrate affinity was reduced at
low temperatures in the torpid state [16]. AMPD was also
inhibited in rabbit heart experiencing hypoxia [34]. In
that study, AMP deamination was high early in the
ischemic period, and this served to preserve the AEC. After
prolonged ischemia, however, AMPD was stably inhibited
and IMP accumulation was implicated in AMPD inhibition. Hence, it can be recognized that AMPD is involved
in two forms of energy stress in muscles – that caused by
burst muscle exercise (e.g. active frogs jumping) and that
caused by ischemia/hypoxia due to oxygen limitation. In
both cases, an initial decrease in ATP and increase in ADP
and AMP leads to an increase in the amount of bound
AMPD localized physically with the subcellular area(s)
where AMP is accumulating. However, whereas energy
stress due to exercise is typically short-lived until fatigue
sets in and then quickly reversed, energy stress due to
hypoxia/ischemia can be of indefinite term (e.g. days or
weeks of freezing for wood frogs). Therefore, it appears
that species that are tolerant of freezing (or of anoxia or of
deep torpor) allow their total adenylate pool to be partially depleted as an early response to stress (using AMPD
to drain the pool) but then need to arrest the process and
re-establish homeostasis in a hypometabolic state that can
be sustained over the long term. Phosphorylation of
bound AMPD may be the key in this phase. Bound AMPD
in 24 h frozen frogs is a high phosphate form with rela-

tively low affinity for AMP and strongly inhibited by IMP.
Hence, it is likely that enzyme activity in vivo is low over
the long term in frozen muscle. Effects of low temperature
and high glucose (both conditions in frozen muscle) on
S0.5 AMP support the same conclusion. Numerous studies
with multiple animal systems of diverse phylogenetic origins have shown that one of the key mechanisms that regulates animal transitions into hypometabolic states is
protein phosphorylation [11]. The present data suggest
that AMPD activity is similarly integrated into the needs of
the hypometabolic, frozen state by phosphorylation of
the bound enzyme.
Reversal of these processes during thawing, including
enzyme dephosphorylation, temperature rise and glucose
decrease, will all contribute to a return by AMPD to normal function, as in control muscle. Recovery of other
enzymatic systems will also allow a recovery of muscle
high energy reserves (e.g. total adenylate and creatine
phosphate pools), the clearance of glucose and glycolytic
end products, the re-establishment of aerobic metabolism, and the reactivation of a variety of energy-expensive
cell functions that are typically strongly suppressed in
hypometabolic states including the activities of ion
motive ATPases (needed for muscle contractile activity),
transcription and translation [11,35]. Given the variety of
metabolic functions that must recover (or be repaired)
after thawing, it is perhaps not surprising that hind leg
reflex contractions took more than 4 hours to return in
frogs thawed at 6–8°C [36] and that isolated wood frog
skeletal muscles still showed marked impairment of locomotor endurance up to 96 h post-freeze [37].

Conclusion
Overall, this study shows that skeletal muscle AMPD from
control and frozen frogs has significantly different kinetic
parameters that would alter enzyme function during
freezing. Binding, allosteric effectors, glucose, temperature and reversible phosphorylation all play roles in regulating wood frog AMPD and adjusting enzyme function
for optimal action in the regulation of cellular adenylate
levels in ischemic frozen muscle. For example, phosphorylation of bound AMPD may be responsible for some of
the unique properties of the bound enzyme in frozen
muscle such as the change in sensitivity to ADP activation,
inhibition by IMP, and the response of the enzyme to
high glucose. Reversible phosphorylation control of
AMPD could also have a critical role in coordinating
AMPD function with respect to other enzymes of muscle
energy metabolism to minimize overall energy use while
frozen and achieve maximum extension of viability.

Methods
Animals and chemicals
Male wood frogs were captured from spring breeding
ponds in the Ottawa area. Animals were washed in a tetracycline bath, and placed in plastic containers with damp
sphagnum moss at 5°C for two weeks prior to experimentation. Control frogs were sampled directly from this condition. For freezing exposure, frogs were placed in closed
plastic boxes with damp paper toweling on the bottom,
and put in an incubator set at -3°C. A 45 min cooling
period was allowed during which the body temperature of
the frogs cools to below -0.5°C (the equilibrium freezing
point of wood frog body fluids) and nucleation is triggered due to skin contact with ice crystals formed on the
paper toweling [38]. Subsequently, timing of a 24 h freeze
exposure began. Both control and experimental frogs were
sacrificed by pithing, followed by rapid dissection, and
freezing of tissue samples in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissues were stored at -80°C until use. Conditions for animal
care, experimentation, and euthanasia were approved by
the Carleton University Animal Care Committee in
accordance with guidelines set down by the Canadian
Council on Animal Care. Biochemicals and coupling
enzymes were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St.
Louis, MO) or Boehringer-Mannheim (Montreal, PQ).
Preparation of tissue extracts
Samples of frozen skeletal muscle were homogenized 1:5
w:v in ice-cold buffer A (50 mM MOPS, 2 mM EDTA, 2
mM EGTA, 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0), with a few crystals of the protease
inhibitor, phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride, added immediately prior to homogenization with a Polytron homogenizer at 50% of full power. Homogenates were centrifuged
in a Hermle Z 360 K centrifuge for 30 min at 10,000 × g
and the supernatant was removed.

In cases where ion or metabolite effects on AMPD were
being investigated, crude extracts were then centrifuged
through small columns of Sephadex G-50 to remove
endogenous enzyme effectors. To do this, 5 ml syringe
barrels were plugged with glass wool and packed with
Sephadex G-50 equilibrated in buffer A. Packed syringes
were centrifuged in a bench-top IEC clinical centrifuge at
full power for 1 min and eluant was discarded. A 500 μl
aliquot of supernatant was then layered onto the column
followed by a second centrifugation as above. The eluant
was collected and stored on ice.
For experiments where bound AMPD activity in the pellet
was assessed, the pellet from the original homogenate was
resuspended in a volume of buffer A equal to that used for
the original homogenization. The resuspension was then
centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min and the supernatant
was decanted. The procedure was repeated twice more and

then the final pellet was resuspended in homogenization
buffer, and used for assay.
Enzyme assay
Enzyme activity was assayed in a 200 μl final volume
using a Thermo Labsystems Multiskan Spectrum microplate reader. Standard assays were conducted at 25°C.
Optimal assay conditions for AMPD were 50 mM MOPS
buffer (pH 7.2), 5.0 mM AMP, and 20 μl of enzyme
extract, monitored at 285 nm. One unit of enzyme activity
is defined as the amount that produced 1 μmol of IMP per
minute at 25°C. For assays of bound AMPD, in which a
resuspension of the pellet was assayed, a glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)-coupled assay was used. Optimal conditions were 50 mM MOPS buffer (pH 7.2), 5.0 mM AMP,
0.15 mM NADH, 7.5 mM α-ketoglutarate, 1 unit of GDH
and 10 μl of resuspended pellet, monitored at 340 nm.
One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount that
consumed 1 μmol of NADH per minute at 25°C.

at 10,000 × g for 30 min and the supernatant was
decanted. The procedure was repeated twice more (to
ensure removal of all low molecular weight effectors) and
then the pellet was resuspended in homogenization
buffer, and used for assay.
Kinetic parameters
Enzyme kinetic constants were determined using a nonlinear least-squares regression computer program [39];
substrate affinity data were fitted to Hill plots.

In vitro incubations to stimulate endogenous kinases and
phosphatases
To assess the effect of reversible phosphorylation on the
bound form of AMPD, incubations were prepared under
conditions that stimulated the activities of endogenous
protein kinases or protein phosphatases and the resulting
effects on AMPD were assayed. Pellets containing bound
AMPD were prepared and washed as above and then
resuspended in 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, aliquoted into different tubes, and incubated under the following conditions, in a final volume of
1 mL:
