Abstract
Background: Several in silico methods exist that were developed to predict protein interactions
from the copious amount of genomic and proteomic data. One of these methods is Domain Fusion,
which has proven to be effective in predicting functional links between proteins.
Results: Analyzing the structures of multi-domain single-chain peptides, we found that domain
pairs located less than 30 residues apart on a chain are almost certain to share a physical interface.
The majority of these interactions are also conserved across separate chains. We make use of this
observation to improve domain fusion based protein interaction predictions, and demonstrate this
by implementing it on a set of Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins.
Conclusion: We show that existing structural data supports the domain fusion hypothesis.
Empirical information from structural data also enables us to refine and assess domain fusion based
protein interaction predictions. These interactions can then be integrated with downstream
biochemical and genetic assays to generate more reliable protein interaction data sets.

Background
Networks of interacting molecules drive every process in
biological cells. Proteins dominate these networks, some
of which involve transient interactions such as signal
transduction cascades and ligand-receptor interactions,
while others form more permanent molecular machineries such as ribosomes and polymerases. Unraveling these
networks and interactions will not only help us better
understand complex cellular processes, but also enable us
to make inferences about the function of individual proteins through 'guilt-by-association' [1].
Over the last few years, high-throughput interaction detection assays have been introduced and refined to complement the traditional genetic and biochemical techniques.
High-throughput mass spectrometry protein complex

identification (reviewed by Pandey and Mann [2]), and
yeast two-hybrid systems [3] are examples of these. The
success of these techniques is well illustrated in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which networks of
its interacting proteome where constructed using genomewide screens. [4-7]
The wealth of genomic and protein sequences, the
increase of 3D structures of protein complexes, together
with the deluge of microarray expression data, has provided researchers with an overwhelming body of information that can be used to infer both functional as well as
interaction linkages. Clearly, bioinformatics and computational biology are necessary tools for delineating this
information. In response to the data explosion, several in

silico methods have recently been developed to predict
associations from these data.
Phylogenetic profiles focus on the co-occurrences of genes
across several organisms. By studying the pattern of evolutionary conservation between sets of genes in different
organisms (phylogenetic distribution), it has been shown
that these phylogenetic profiles can be successfully used to
infer both localization as well as functional association
between proteins [8-10]. Protein domains that are found
fused together within a protein are frequently involved in
the same process, and in many examples proven to be
physically interacting. This phenomenon is the basis for
the domain fusion analysis, which can be used to predict
protein interactions in cases where the fused domain pair
is found independently across separate protein chains
[11,12].
Structural data has also been mined and analyzed for residue patterns within interfaces between pairs of interacting proteins. These are then used to train learning models
for ab initio categorization and prediction of protein interactions [13,14]. Jansen and co-workers [15] illustrated
how expression profiles from mRNA expression data
could be harnessed and used as an effective source for the
prediction of protein interactions.
A number of groups have compared and reported on the
protein interaction datasets that are emerging from the
various genome-scale biochemical, genetic and in silico
experiments [16-18]. All of them drew a similar conclusion; high-throughput methods produce little overlapping results, and taken singularly, each technique has a
high error rate (false positive and false negative). Each of
these methods has their own specific strength and weakness, and covers a separate subset of interactions. Integrating the various result sets together, allows one to piece
together a map of the interacting proteome that is more
reliable with higher accuracy, and more informative with
higher coverage.

tein chain tend to interact, to refine the domain fusion
analysis. This way, we aim to improve the accuracy of the
domain fusion analysis.
Domain fusion
The basis for domain fusion (or gene fusion) is the observation that certain proteins (termed the Rosetta stones) in
a given species are found to consist of a fusion between
two separate proteins in another species. Through fusion,
the entropy of dissociation between the two proteins is
reduced, and it is hypothesized that in all likelihood,
these two separate proteins share a functional association,
if not a physical interaction [11,12].

Domains have been described as the primary building
blocks of proteins [19], recombining in various permutations, resulting in proteins of completely different functions [20]. In our implementation of the domain fusion
analysis, we chose the representation of proteins being
composed of domains, separated by linkers on a peptide
chain.
In this paper, we make use of existing structural data to
support the domain fusion hypothesis. We interrogated
known 3D structures for evidence of inter-domain physical interactions on the same chain. We investigated and
concluded that there was an association between the distances at which domains are spaced apart on the chain,
and the propensity for a domain-pair to interact.
We also show that domain pairs, located in close proximity on a protein chain, are likely to interact even when
found residing on different chains, hence proving that the
domain fusion hypothesis is valid.
Finally, we demonstrate that peptide chains with closely
spaced domains are likely to make better Rosetta stones,
and we make use of this observation to improve domain
fusion based protein interaction predictions.

Results
The study by von Mering and co-workers [17] showed that
in silico methods have higher coverage and higher accuracy than the majority of biochemical/genetics methods,
second only to high-throughput mass spectrometry. The
use of sensible strategies and filters has allowed in silico
analyses to provide better performance. On top of that,
these methods are less biased towards abundant proteins.
In silico analyses are indispensable, and further improvements of these methods to make them more accurate will
provide a cleaner set of data for downstream biochemical/
genetic studies.
In this study, we make use of an empirical observation
that domain pairs, which lie in close proximity on a pro-

Supporting the domain fusion hypothesis
The available structural data indicate that intra-chain
domain pairs, which lie in close proximity on a peptide
chain, tend to physically interact with one another. The
mean distances of interacting intra-chain domain pairs are
smaller than ones which do not interact; interacting pairs
are on the average 50 residues apart, while non-interacting
pairs have a mean distance of 166 residues between them.

In order to verify the correlation between distance and
interaction, we made use of contingency tables and the
chi-squared test statistic. For a set of inter-domain distances ranging from 5 residues to 200 residues, we constructed 2 × 2 contingency tables that classified domain

Distance between domains pairs

Figure 1
Distance between domain pairs on a protein chain and the likelihood that they interact
Distance between domain pairs on a protein chain and the likelihood that they interact The solid line indicates the
percentage of domain pairs, within a distance range apart, which are in contact. The broken line shows the distribution of chisquared values corresponding to constructed 2 × 2 contingency tables that classified domain pairs according to 2 criterions; 1)
whether or not they are separated by a distance no greater than the upper limit of each range, and 2) whether or not the
domain pair is interacting. The percentage of interacting domain pairs drop noticeably after 30 residues, and the chi-squared
value is also maximum at this threshold.

pairs according to two criterions; 1) whether or not they
are separated by a distance no greater than a threshold,
and 2) whether or not the domain pair is interacting. The
chi-squared value of each table was used as a statistic to
test the null hypothesis (H0): Domains pairs separated by
no greater than a predefined distance and their tendency
to interact were independent. The p-values indicate the
probability of having the chi-squared test statistic as
extreme as, or larger than observed when H0 is true.
We found that the contingency table for domain pairs
spaced up to 30 residues apart had the highest chi-squared
value, with a statistically significant p-value of less than
0.001, allowing us to confidently reject H0. This trend is
noticeable in the chart illustrating the proportion of interacting pairs across various inter-pair distances (figure 1).
Domain pairs located less than 30 residues apart are

almost certainly (90%) to be in contact with each other,
whereas only half (51%) of domain pairs with more than
30 residues separation were categorized as physically
interacting. The chi-squared value is also overlaid on the
chart in a dotted line, representing the test statistic from
each corresponding contingency table.
In order to validate the domain fusion hypothesis, we not
only need to show that domain pairs on the same chain
tend to interact with each other, but importantly, this
same domain pair will tend to be in contact if they are
located independently across separate chains of a
polypeptide complex. From our data, we noticed that
71% of domain pairs, which lie within 30 residues of each
other on the same chain, could be found physically
interacting across separate chains of a complex. In contrast only 38% of domain pairs lying greater than 30 resi-

dues apart are seen to be in contact within a multi-chain
complex. Once again, putting this into a contingency
table and evaluating the chi-squared statistic we reject the
null hypothesis (p-value <= 0.001). In other words, there
is a correlation between domain-pairs spaced less than 30
residues apart on a single peptide chain and their tendency to interact across separate chains of a polypeptide
complex.
30 residues criteria applied to Swiss-Prot proteins
We wanted to verify that the 30 residues criteria could be
used as a measure to filter and improve predictions made
using the domain fusion methodology. A set of proteins
for the budding yeast S. cerevisiae was downloaded from
Swiss-Prot, and domain fusion based protein interactions
were predicted as described in the Methods section. After
filtering for promiscuous domains, a total of 9279 protein
interactions remained, of which 28% or 2629 were supported by a Rosetta stone with no more than 30 residues
between the fused domains.

The functional category assigned to each protein in an
interacting pair was used to gauge the plausibility of the
interaction; if two different proteins were found physically interacting, one would expect the two proteins to
have overlapping functional categories. 62% of the interacting protein pairs, supported by a 30 residue Rosetta
stone, have both partners belonging to the same functional category. The same proportion for interacting pairs
not supported by a 30 residue Rosetta stone is 48%. This
14% difference is significant with a p-value of less than
0.001, using a two-sample t-test.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/161

Our study of multi-domain, single and multiple-chain
protein structures in the PDB gave us two results. First of
all, it supports the domain fusion hypothesis suggested by
Marcotte and Enright. Secondly, it allows us to conclude
that single chain peptides with closely spaced domain
pairs make better Rosetta stones, and hence better predictors of protein interactions.
Evident from the set of PDB structures we studied, is a correlation between the distance separating a pair of domains
on a protein chain, and their tendency to physically interact with one another. As described by Marcotte and coworkers when they constructed the domain fusion
hypothesis for evolution of protein interactions, affinity
between interacting pairs of domains may be enhanced
when the domains are fused together on the same chain
[11]. Consequently, close proximity of the interacting pair
on the same chain increases the effective local concentration of the two domains, facilitating the interaction. The
biochemical advantage for such an arrangement would
explain the tendency for interacting domains to be found
close together on a protein chain. Our observation that
domain pairs located less than 30 residues apart are
almost certainly to share an interface clearly supports this
idea.
Previously, Park and co-workers [21]had observed this figure in an unrelated report. In this study, we adopted a different concept of a protein domain – PFAM categories
which are essentially sequence-based annotations. Analyzing a substantial set of structural data from the PDB, we
also derive at this similar threshold of 30 residues, and
show it to be statistically significant.

Discussion
In silico methods for predicting protein interactions are
not only able to match the accuracy of the other genetic,
biochemical and biophysical techniques, but also have
the added advantage of providing higher coverage [17].
Among the in silico methods, domain fusion is an attractive technique because it enables a functional link to be
drawn between two proteins based solely on their primary
sequence. Still, large-scale sets of high-throughput protein
interaction data available today are spurious, more than
half of them proving to be false positives [17], the challenge remains to improve the quality of high throughput
protein interaction data sets.

Conservation of domain interactions across multi-chain
structures
The data from multi-chain PDB structures provide additional support to the domain fusion hypothesis, by showing that most of the intra-chain domain interactions are
similarly represented across separate chains of a complex.
This provides additional mechanistic evidence that the
interaction between the two domains is most probably
functional and conserved.

Protein interactions can be classified as either permanent
or transient interactions. The data from this study were
taken from the PDB, where most of the submitted structures are results from x-ray crystallography experiments.
Consequently, we believe that the vast majority of our
deduced domain and protein interactions are physical,
permanent interactions.

Functional classification of non-interacting domains in
close proximity
We tried to uncover a pattern within the set of closely
spaced, yet non-interacting domain pairs. We wanted to
detect if there was an over-representation of domains
from a specific molecular functional category in this noninteracting list. This list is displayed in Table 1. From the
Gene Ontology categories of the domains, it is obvious

To our knowledge, this is the first time structural data has
been used to support the domain fusion hypothesis.

Furthermore, since the interactions we can detect from
structural data are more likely to be permanent interactions, it is possible that the reason no physical contact is
witnessed between these proximal domains in structural
data is because the domains form transient interactions
that are not captured in the x-ray crystallography data.
Hot loops and interactions
We also looked for a relation between protein disorder
and interacting domain pairs. We wanted to see if protein
domain pairs which interact on the same chain, tend to be
linked by a disordered region. To this effect, we used Dis-

that a good proportion of domains on the list are involved

due to the small number of non-interacting domains in

unable to infer any relationship between disorder and
interacting domains.
Use of 30 residue criteria to refine domain fusion
predictions
Our results from predicting interactions among S. cerevisiae proteins indicate that Rosetta stones with domains
separated by less than 30 residues do indeed make better
domain interaction (and hence protein interaction)
predictors.

The set of protein interactions inferred from these Rosetta
stones are enriched with more reliable interactions, as
judged by using similar function as a criteria. The total
number of interactions is reduced to nearly a quarter
when employing this method. This allows us to conclude
that the number of false positives is reduced, increasing
the accuracy of the prediction. Without needing to
employ a hard filter, protein interactions predicted using

the domain fusion methodology may be ranked according to the quality of the Rosetta stones each interaction is
inferred from, allowing one to identify a much smaller
subset of more reliable interactions, and use them for
downstream analyses.

Conclusions
We have successfully demonstrated the use of current
structural data as a resource for refining current protein
interaction predictions, in particular domain fusion predictions. Our data strongly suggests that domain pairs
separated by less than 30 residues on a peptide chain are
almost certainly to physically interact, and this criterion is
useful in accessing protein interactions predicted from
Rosetta stone proteins.
Going forward, the availability of a large number of structures through structural genomics programs will facilitate
a larger sampling of the domain structure space. New patterns may emerge as use of this data becomes available,
allowing better predictions to be made.

Methods
Intra-chain domain interactions
We used domain models from the Protein Family database (PFAM) [23] which were mapped onto structures
from the Protein Databank (PDB) [24]. The PFAM to PDB
mappings were obtained from PFAM data files, and we
only considered PFAM entries that were tagged with the
type 'Domain'. There are a total of 4169 peptide chains in
the PDB that are annotated with more than one PFAM
domain, comprising a total of 504 unique PFAM domains
present within the data set. In order to obtain a nonredundant representation of these peptide chains, we took
clusters of them based on 50% sequence identity, and
selected one representative from each cluster. This left us
with a set of 565 3D structures of multi-domain peptide
chains, comprising a total of 996 distinct domain pairs, of
which 478 are unique pairs.

We used the coordinates within the PDB data files to calculate the distances between domains, and to determine if
they are interacting. Two domains are judged to be
interacting if they share at least five contacting residue
pairs, where contacting residues are residue pairs with less
than 6Å between their respective alpha-carbon atoms.
Multi-chain interactions
Using a similar approach to the above, we obtained a set
of multi-chain PDB structures in which the previously
determined domain-domain interactions can be observed
across separate peptide chains within a complex. The
ASALIST from the PQS server [25]was used to sift out the
biologically significant contacts from the crystal packed
structures. Of the 379 domain pairs above, 305 were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/161

found on separate chains of a complex, and these were
used for the analysis.
GO functional annotation
PFAM domains were categorized into Gene Ontology
(GO) molecular functions and cellular processes using the
PFAM2GO data provided by the GO consortium [26].
Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein interactions
prediction
In order to assess how distance between domains could be
used to improve the domain fusion based protein interaction predictions, we predicted interactions between 6918
proteins from the organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae found
within the Swiss-Prot database, and gauged the quality of
the interactions by looking at the function of each interacting protein.

The steps taken to predict protein interactions based on
domain fusion are as follows. Swiss-Prot (release 42.9)
and Trembl (release 25.9) [27] protein datasets were first
searched for multi-domain proteins, by relying on their
PFAM annotations. As above, only PFAM domains of type
'Domain' where considered. These multi-domain proteins
were then catalogued as Rosetta Stones. Pairwise domain
interactions were inferred by cataloging each distinct
domain pair found on every Rosetta Stone protein,
together with the number of residues separating the pair.
As described by Marcotte and co-workers [11], domain
interactions involving the 5% most promiscuous domains
were discarded, removing the majority of false positives.
This domain interaction set was then used to predict pairwise protein interactions between the S. cerevisiae proteins, by looking at the complement of PFAM domains
between each and every pair of proteins, and seeing if
there were any Rosetta stone determined domain interactions between the domains of each protein. The protein
interactions were sorted into two groups; one group
inferred from domain interactions supported by the
existence of a Rosetta stone protein with no more than 30
residues between the domain pair, and the other group
with no support from a 30 residue Rosetta stone.
To validate these protein interactions, we mapped the proteins to the MIPS comprehensive yeast genome database
[28], and looked for interacting protein partners that
share the same MIPS functional category. Interactions
between pairs that share the same function are more likely
to be true.
All the data was stored in a relational database schema
implemented in MySQL, with a set of perl modules written for data transaction and manipulation. The Bioperl
bioinformatics tool kit [29] was used to parse Swiss-Prot,

each atom from each PDB structure.
