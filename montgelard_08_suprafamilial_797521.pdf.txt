Abstract
Background: The number of rodent clades identified above the family level is contentious, and to date, no consensus has been
reached on the basal evolutionary relationships among all rodent families. Rodent suprafamilial phylogenetic relationships are
investigated in the present study using ~7600 nucleotide characters derived from two mitochondrial genes (Cytochrome b and
12S rRNA), two nuclear exons (IRBP and vWF) and four nuclear introns (MGF, PRKC, SPTBN, THY). Because increasing the
number of nucleotides does not necessarily increase phylogenetic signal (especially if the data is saturated), we assess the
potential impact of saturation for each dataset by removing the fastest-evolving positions that have been recognized as sources
of inconsistencies in phylogenetics.
Results: Taxonomic sampling included multiple representatives of all five rodent suborders described. Fast-evolving positions
for each dataset were identified individually using a discrete gamma rate category and sites belonging to the most rapidly evolving
eighth gamma category were removed. Phylogenetic tree reconstructions were performed on individual and combined datasets
using Parsimony, Bayesian, and partitioned Maximum Likelihood criteria. Removal of fast-evolving positions enhanced the
phylogenetic signal to noise ratio but the improvement in resolution was not consistent across different data types. The results
suggested that elimination of fastest sites only improved the support for nodes moderately affected by homoplasy (the deepest
nodes for introns and more recent nodes for exons and mitochondrial genes).
Conclusion: The present study based on eight DNA fragments supports a fully resolved higher level rodent phylogeny with
moderate to significant nodal support. Two inter-suprafamilial associations emerged. The first comprised a monophyletic
assemblage containing the Anomaluromorpha (Anomaluridae + Pedetidae) + Myomorpha (Muridae + Dipodidae) as sister clade
to the Castorimorpha (Castoridae + Geomyoidea). The second suprafamilial clustering identified a novel association between
the Sciuromorpha (Gliridae + (Sciuridae + Aplodontidae)) and the Hystricomorpha (Ctenodactylidae + Hystricognathi) which
together represents the earliest dichotomy among Rodentia. Molecular time estimates using a relaxed Bayesian molecular clock
dates the appearance of the five suborders nearly contemporaniously at the KT boundary and this is congruent with suggestions
of an early explosion of rodent diversity. Based on these newly proposed phylogenetic relationships, the evolution of the
zygomasseteric pattern that has been used for a long time in rodent systematics is evaluated.

Background
Since the pioneer work of Brandt [1], a wealth of literature
has been devoted to suprafamilial relationships among
rodents. To date, however, no consensus has been reached
based on morphological or paleontological evidence.
Nearly a century after Brandt [1], Simpson ([2], p. 197)
referred to the order Rodentia and stated that "their relationships are involved in an intricate web of convergence,
divergence, parallelism, and other taxonomic pitfalls."
The addition of molecular data contributed significantly
in constructing a species tree for the order Rodentia and
the most up to date taxonomic arrangement includes at
least 2277 species distributed among 33 families and five
suborders [3]. Recently Huchon et al. [4] recognized the
Laotian rock rat (Laonastes aenigmamus) from Laos [5] as
an additional family Diatomyidae closely related to the
Ctenodactylidae. Despite this new addition, the number
of initially recognized rodent families by Simpson [2] and
Wood [6] remained fairly stable (for review see [3]). The
number of rodent clades identified above the familial
level, however, led to numerous inconsistencies and controversies (see [7-9]). In the present study we adopted the
most up to date suprafamilial classification as reviewed by
Carleton and Musser [3] who recognize five suborders
(Sciuromorpha, Castorimorpha, Myomorpha, Anomaluromorpha and Hystricomorpha).
Hystricomorpha contains 19 families (78 genera and 291
species), and includes the previously problematic Ctenodactylidae [3] and the newly discovered Diatomyidae [4].
The two latter families were identified as the sister taxon
of the 17 traditional families comprising the infraorder
Hystricognathi [4,10]. The monophyly of Hystricomorpha is currently supported by morphological, paleontological and molecular data (see review in [10-13]).
Sciuromorpha includes Gliridae, Aplodontidae and Sciuridae. The latter two families are closely related based on
hard and soft morphological features [14-17], albumin
immunology [18] and sequence data (for example see
[13,19-21]). The myomorphous Gliridae is regarded as an
early offshoot of Sciuromorpha and this is supported by
middle ear anatomy [14], arterial patterns [22]) and previous molecular investigations (for example [19,21,23]).
Castorimorpha also comprises three families, Castoridae,
Heteromyidae and Geomyidae. This association was first
suggested by Tullberg [24] and, although not well supported by morphology, has fairly strong molecular support (for example see [13,19-21]). The two superfamilies,
Dipodoidea and Muroidea (including one and six families, respectively) comprise the suborder Myomorpha and
their close affinity is well established (see [3]). The Anomaluromorpha contains Anomaluridae and Pedetidae.
Associations between the later two families are strongly
supported by mitochondrial and nuclear data

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/321

[4,11,21,25] and this agrees with Winge [26] and Tullberg
[24]. However, a recent paper by Horner et al. [27] based
on the coding regions of the mitochondrial genome disagrees with these suggestions and places Anomaluridae
(Pedetidae was not included) as a sister taxon of Hystricognathi.
Evolutionary associations among these five suborders are
not well resolved [3] and even the monophyly of the order
has been questioned in the past based on mtDNA analyses
[28,29]. The notion of paraphyly of the Rodentia, however, was short lived and never supported by morphology
and more comprehensive genetic studies [13,20,30,31].
Based on available evidence, Carleton and Musser [3],
suggested that Sciuromorpha, Myomorpha and Hystricomorpha are well established while the monophyly and/or
phylogenetic position of Castorimorpha and Anomaluromorpha is less secure. Subsequent retroposed SINEs provided additional evidence for the monophyly of
Myomorpha, Anomaluromorpha and Hystricomorpha
whereas no SINE has been identified for Castorimorpha
or Sciuromorpha. A clade including Myomorpha, Anomaluromorpha and Castorimorpha (the "mouse-related
clade" as defined by Huchon et al. [20]) was also confirmed by several unique SINE insertions [11,32]. Unfortunately, no SINE has been found for any relationships
among the three members of the "mouse-related clade"
(Myomorpha, Anomaluromorpha and Castorimorpha).
Finally the phylogenetic relationships among the three
major rodent groups: Sciuromorpha, "mouse-related
clade" and Hystricomorpha are as yet unresolved.
The introduction of phylogenomics and whole organism
genome sequencing (thousands of nucleotides or amino
acids), coupled to the use of probabilistic methods based
on models of sequence evolution, implicitly led to the
belief that inconsistency in tree reconstructions will soon
be something of the past. However, it is clear now that
increasing the number of nucleotides does not always
solve incongruence in phylogenetics [33-35]. Even phylogenomic reconstructions can result in biases, and as a
consequence, produce well supported incorrect tree topologies (for example [33]). In addition, gene tree reconstructions are based on numerous implicit assumptions
that are seldom tested (for example gene orthology,
reversible time homogeneous substitution process, stationarity of base composition through time). Violations
of these assumptions may lead to compositional bias,
contrasted patterns of saturation and heterogeneous evolutionary rates among genes and lineages. Current phylogenetic reconstruction methods do not efficiently test and
account for such biases, the consequence being reconstruction artefacts such as long branch attraction (see for
example [36-38]). To avoid these pitfalls, some authors
[34,37,39] emphasize the necessity to test the quality and

consistency of the data and recommended that sources of
inconsistencies should be excluded (such as fast-evolving
or compositionally biased positions). This is more feasible with large datasets because removing a part of the data
will theoretically leave enough informative positions to
recover confidence and consistency.

and those remaining after removal of the poorly aligned
positions with Gblocks, together with the number of positions in intronic and exonic regions, are indicated for each
gene in Table 1 (also see Additional files 1 and 2 for intron
alignment before and after Gblocks). Although the total
length of each intron varied considerably between taxa
(Table 1), the number of conserved positions used for
phylogeny reconstruction was close to the mean length
for each fragment. For each gene and each pair of taxa, we
graphically compared the p-distances (percent divergence) before and after removal of poorly aligned positions using Gblocks. With the exception of PRKC, the
slopes of the regression lines (MGF: 0.89, PRKC: 0.62,
SPTBN: 0.83, THY: 0.76) indicated a fairly good correlation before and after the exclusion of poorly aligned
regions.

The aims of this paper are firstly to test the current phylogenetic hypotheses surrounding the higher level relationships among rodent families. Moreover, by using a large
dataset we hoped to decipher remaining unsolved relationships among the five recognized rodent suborders.
Secondly, we were particularly interested in comparing
the contribution of three different datasets: two mitochondrial genes (Cytochrome b and 12S rRNA), two
nuclear exons (the exon 28 of von Willebrand factor –
vWF; exon one of the interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding
protein – IRBP) and four nuclear introns (Stem cell factor
– MGF; protein kinase C – PRKC; β-spectrin non erythrocytic 1 – SPTBN; and Thyrothropin-THY). For each dataset, we determined the distribution of sites according to
eight evolutionary rates and we documented how the
removal of the fast-evolving positions influenced phylogenetic reconstructions.

The estimated number of sites in each of the eight gamma
rate categories for the three main data types (mitochondrial, exon and intron data) is presented in Table 2. Using
TREE-PUZZLE the proportion of invariable sites has been
estimated to be zero in each case. Thus, invariable positions are all included in the first gamma rate category
which encompasses the most sites for the three datasets,
especially for the mitochondrial and exon genes (nearly
40% of sites). These latter two datasets show nearly no
sites in the rate categories 2 and 3 (0 for mitochondrial
genes and 31 for exons) whereas introns show a noticeable homogeneous increase between categories 2 to 7
(between 7.9% and 12.9% of sites). Fastest-evolving sites
(category 8) are more numerous for introns when compared to the other two data types (exon and mtDNA).
These results indicate that mitochondrial and exonic
regions show a similar behaviour in terms of gamma rate
distributions and vary greatly among sites: ~40% of the
positions were invariable and ~12% reached a very high
rate (5.42 and 3.91 for mitochondrial and exon genes,
respectively). This heterogeneity is also evidenced in the
gamma value of the distribution parameter alpha which
varies from 0.20, 0.46 and 2.63 for mitochondrial, exon
and intron datasets, respectively. The differences between
the fragments sequenced can best be explained by the cod-

rates
The alignments of the mitochondrial cytb and 12S rRNA
genes are respectively 1140 bp and 1042 bp long. A total
of 56 bp in a loop region could not be aligned for the 12S
rRNA fragment and was excluded (positions 933–987).
The mitochondrial dataset comprised 2126 bp and was
subdivided into 5 partitions: one for each codon position
of cytb (380 bp each), and stems (458 bp) and loops (528
bp) for the 12S rRNA region. The two nuclear exons, IRBP
and vWF represented 1299 bp and 1272 bp respectively.
The resulting 2571 positions have been partitioned into
the three codon positions either for each gene separately
(3 partitions of 433 bp each for IRBP and of 424 bp each
for vWF) or from the 2 genes concatenated (3 partitions of
857 bp each). For the introns (MGF, PRKC, SPTBN and

ing nature of mitochondrial and exon genes when compared to the non-coding introns.
For the mitochondrial genes, 265 positions have been
identified as fast-evolving sites (eighth relative gamma
rate of 5.42) and subsequently removed. For the cytb gene,
157 positions were eliminated (see Table 3) of which 135
were at third codon position whereas only one of the
removed characters was at a second codon position. Stems
and loops of the 12S rRNA gene are also markedly different with 103 of the 108 positions excluded occurring in
the loop section. As for the coding-cytb, exclusion of fastevolving positions for the two concatenated exons (IRBP
and vWF) was also concentrated at third codon positions
(246 third position sites out of 312 excluded; eighth
gamma rate of 3.92). For introns, 536 fast-evolving posi-

tions (eighth gamma rate of 2.1) were excluded representing 149 sites for MGF, 91 for PRKC, 181 for SPTBN, 97 for
THY and 18 for the combined flanking-exonic regions of
the introns. When sites corresponding to the eighth
gamma category are removed, amplitude of evolutionary
rates becomes 0.0001–4.80 (α = 0.28) for mitochondrial
genes, 0.012–3.56 (α = 0.59) for exons and 0.51–1.63 (α
= 7.16) for introns. In terms of heterogeneity of substitution rates, improvement is substantial for introns (α
comes from 2.63 to 7.16) but much less for exons (0.46 to
0.59) and mitochondrial genes (0.20 to 0.28).
Base composition and saturation analysis
For each dataset (introns, exons and mitochondrial
genes), several taxa deviate significantly in base composition when compared to the average base frequencies of

the total alignment calculated by TREE-PUZZLE. For
introns, eight out of 30 rodents deviate from the average
composition. When fast-evolving sites are removed
(18.5% of the alignment; see Table 2), deviation in base
composition was confined to six taxa (Mus, Geomys, Heteromys, Dipodomys, Cavia, Hystrix). The exons (IRBP and
vWF) and mitochondrial regions showed respectively 12
and 8 taxa (out of 29 rodents; see Additional file 3) deviating in base compositions. After removing 12% of the
fast evolving positions in the exons and also in the mitochondrial regions, only one (Spalax) and three (Heteromys,
Pedetes, Mesocricetus) taxa showed base composition deviations. It can be concluded that the fastest-evolving positions are partly responsible for the biases in composition
and it seems reasonable to suggest that the exclusion of
some of these biases will reduce the violations associated
with base composition assumptions. It can also be noted,
however, that in all datasets, taxa deviating in base composition were found to cluster at their expected phylogenetic position (before and after removal of fastest sites).
Saturation was estimated for each partition, before and
after removal of fast-evolving sites. When using complete
sequences, the slopes of the linear regressions (Table 3)
indicated that 4 partitions in particular appeared saturated (S < 0.13): first and third codon positions of cytb,
loops in 12S rRNA and third codon positions of vWF.
Third positions of IRBP, stems of the 12S rRNA and the
flanking-exons of introns are moderately saturated (S =
0.25, 0.29 and 0.31, respectively). The nine remaining
partitions (mostly confined to intronic regions) are least
saturated and probably also the most informative phylogenetically (S > 0.42). Removal of fast-evolving positions
improves the phylogenetic signal, as indicated by the
steeper slope values for the 16 partitions tested (Table 3).
For third codon positions of cytb, the slope is increased by
an order of magnitude of 10, even though the resulting
value (0.09) is still indicative of significant saturation
present at this position. As shown previously (for example
see [40,41]), the mitochondrial dataset is the most saturated whereas the nuclear genes (exons and introns) are
less affected. Our analyses demonstrated that removal of
the fastest evolving sites decrease saturation in the data
and, although we believe that this provides a substantial
improvement, saturation could not be totally eliminated.
Contribution of different data types to rodent
phylogenetics
The various analyses performed in the present study supported the monophyly of all rodent families represented
by two or more taxa (see Additional file 3). For each dataset (mitochondrial, exon and intron), nodal support
obtained from the MLP (partitioned maximum likelihood) and Bayesian analyses is provided as Additional file
4 for different suprafamilial groupings (letters correspond

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/321

to clades labelled on Figure 1). When the different datasets are compared, only 4 clades are supported by all three
types of data separately: A-Myomorpha, B-Anomaluromorpha, F-Sciuroidea and H-Hystricomorpha. Two
groupings (C-Castorimorpha and E-Myomorpha + Anomaluromorpha + Castorimorpha) are weakly supported by
mitochondrial genes and moderately by exons whereas
clade G-Sciuromorpha received the most support from the
mitochondrial dataset. By comparison, the intronic
regions that are less affected by bias in rate distributions
among sites, and seem to be less saturated, gave more resolution than the exon or mitochondrial data sets. Well
established clades from the literature are strongly supported and moreover the introns also suggest two other
subordinal relationships. First, inside the "mouse-related
clade" (E-Castorimorpha + Myomorpha + Anomaluromorpha), the Myomorpha cluster with Anomaluromorpha (BP = 100, BI = 1.00) to the exclusion of the 2 other
alternatives (D2 and D3 in Additional file 4). Secondly,
the introns suggest a less secure but consistent sister taxon
relationship between Sciuromorpha and Hystricomorpha
(BP = 54, BI = 0.69). The contribution of each intron to
this node is mixed since PRKC (BI = 0.94) and THY (BI =
0.64) support this grouping while MGF (BI = 0.82) and
SPTBN (BI = 0.96) rather suggest a basal split for Hystricomorpha as the first emerging rodent clade. On the other
hand, all four introns individually found Anomaluromorpha as sister group to Myomorpha (BI = 0.46 to 0.85). It
is noticeable that separate analyses of the introns each
contributed signal for these difficult nodes whereas each
mitochondrial and exonic gene does not suggest any relationships.
Removal of fast-evolving positions leads to mixed results.
For the mitochondrial and exon genes, there is a clear
improvement for the support for three clades: C-Castorimorpha, E-(Myomorpha+Anomaluromorpha) + Castorimorpha and G-Sciuromorpha. With the mitochondrial
dataset, however, the well established Anomaluromorpha
and Myomorpha clades [4,21] are distorted when characters are excluded because of the inclusion of Jaculus as a
sister species of Anomalurus. When taken separately, the
exclusion of fast evolving sites for introns negatively
affected the support for most nodes (data not shown),
whereas, when concatenated, all of them (to the exception
of the grouping D-Myomorpha+Anomaluromorpha) are
strongly recovered (see Table 4 and Additional file 4). Furthermore, a noticeable increase in support was found for
Sciuromorpha as a sister clade to Hystricomorpha (BP =
95, BI = 1.00) at the base of the tree.
For mitochondrial and exon datasets, we further exclude
potential homoplasious characters by eliminating fastevolving sites belonging to the Gamma rate category 7. A
total of 187 additional positions were eliminated for the

whole mitochondrial dataset. For exons, 223 sites were
additionally removed at the third positions only because
saturation analyses revealed that first and second positions were not plagued by saturation after elimination of
rate category 8 (see Table 3). Thus, 1674 and 2035 positions were reanalysed for the mitochondrial and exon
datasets, respectively. Analysis with PUZZLE indicated no
improvement in among site rate variation with the intervals ranging between 0.0001–4.68 (α = 0.29) for mitochondrial genes and 0.0165–3.46 (α = 0.64) for exons.
Phylogenetic analyses conducted with RAxML on these
reduced datasets only led to the deterioration of support
for various phylogenetic relationships and in fact rather
found more ambiguous clusterings (an unlikely phylogenetic position was found for Castor, Pedetes and Homo).
The exclusion of these data thus clearly reflect a decrease
in the resolving power of the data and therefore support
suggestions that more saturated data also contains phylogenetic signal [42,43]. The same explanation can also be
put forward to explain the reduced support for the Myomorpha + Anomaluromorpha node after removal of fastest sites (see Table 4).
Finally, to further explore the utility of each dataset (mitochondrial genes, exons and introns) the three datasets

(with and without fast-evolving sites) were combined in a
pairwise fashion (Table 4) and results are presented for
the two main nodes of interest (relationships among the
"mouse-related clade" and between the three main rodent
lineages). Based on all nucleotides, none of the three pairwise combinations support the branching pattern
between the three main rodent clades. After removal of
the fastest-evolving positions, the clade Hystricomorpha +
Sciuromorpha is supported by two out of three combinations (Table 4). In fact, the combined mitochondrial
genes + exons do not support any one of the two clades.
On the contrary, the combinations that included the
intron data were fully congruent with the combined analyses in the sense that the clade Anomaluromorpha + Myomorpha is well supported and the Sciuromorpha +
Hystricomorpha is revealed after elimination of fastest
positions.
Concatenation of datasets, alternative hypotheses and
molecular dating
Concatenation of the eight genes resulted in the analyses
of 7594 characters for the full dataset and 6480 characters
when fast-evolving sites are removed. Results are presented in Table 4, Figure 1, and Additional file 4. With the
two probabilistic approaches, removal of fast-evolving

sites recovered a strong basal clade uniting Hystricomorpha+Sciuromorpha (BP = 91, BI = 1.00; clade I in Additional file 4) whereas less support for this grouping was
obtained using the full data set (BP = 37, BI = 0.22 for the
same clade). The "mouse-related group" (clade E) is
strongly supported in both cases and the sister taxon relationship between Myomorpha and Anomaluromorpha
(clade D) is well supported by both data treatments
(reduced dataset: BP = 73, BI = 0.90; all data: BP = 88, BI
= 0.93). The remaining rodent relationships also received
good support when using concatenated gene sequences
and confirmed an increase in phylogenetic resolution
when data are combined (see for example [44-47]).
For the MP analyses, the number of informative characters
was 4219 and 3595, for the complete and reduced datasets respectively. Only one tree was recovered in each case
and, as with probabilistic methods, most relationships
were strongly supported (see Additional file 4). The two
parsimony trees differed in the basal branching order in
that the complete dataset suggests the sister group relationship between Sciuromorpha and the "mouse-related
clade" (group I2 in Additional file 4; BP = 78) whereas the
reduced dataset weakly supports the clustering Sciuromorpha + Hystricomorpha (clade I; BP = 48). As with other
reconstruction methods, the clade Myomorpha+Anomaluromorpha (clade D) is better supported by the complete
(BP = 72) than by the reduced (BP = 41) dataset.
When the 1113 fastest evolving sites (that were excluded
from the analyses above) were analysed separately, (100
bootstrap replications with PHYML; data not shown) the
well supported relationships such as the monophyly of
the five rodent suborders was supported (moderately for
Sciuromorpha: BP = 55; and stronger for the other four
clades A, B, C and H in Additional file 4: BP range 82–99).
At the higher level clade E-(Myomorpha + Anomaluromorpha) + Castorimorpha was found (BP = 82), but other

relationships (Myomorpha + Castorimorpha and Hystricomorpha as the first emergence in Rodentia) were weakly
supported (BP = 43 and 42, respectively).
To evaluate the stability of the most likely topology (Figure 1), we tested nine hypothetical topologies representing the clustering possibilities between suborders of "Emouse-related clade" (A-Myomorpha, B-Anomaluromorpha and C-Castorimorpha), and "G-Sciuromorpha" and
"H-Hystricomorpha". When these nine topologies are
evaluated on the whole concatenated dataset, results of
the AU and SH tests indicated that tree-1 is identified as
the best hypothesis but none of the other eight topologies
were significantly worse (at the 5% level) than the most
likely tree (Table 5). Both tests are congruent even if probabilities obtained are sometimes quite different (see
hypotheses 5 and 9). After removal of fast-evolving sites,
tree-1 is still identified as the best topology and P-values
increased. Five out the nine trees (5 to 9 in Table 5) can
reasonably be rejected and the grouping I-Sciuromorpha+Hystricomorpha is consistently supported. Posterior
probabilities also decreased for hypotheses indicated by
trees 4 to 9. However, trees 2 and 3 are also not supported
by PP when the whole dataset is tested.
Estimation of divergence times and the 95% credibility
intervals are reported for each clade on the chronogram in
Figure 2. The Ctenodactylidae and Geomyidae families
show a recent origin: around 5 and 7 Mya (95% interval
3.1–7.6 and 5.1–10.5 Mya), whereas Dipodidae is the
oldest family originating approximately 47 Mya (40.3–
54.6 Mya). Other families (Cricetidae, Heteromyidae,
Sciuridae, Muridae, Gliridae, and Anomaluridae) originated between 27 and 38 Mya (95% interval between 27.1
and 46.5 Mya). Four of the five suborders (Hystricomorpha, Myomorpha, Castorimorpha, and Anomaluromorpha) diversified nearly contemporaneously between 65
and 67 Mya (interval between 57.2 and 75.7 Mya)

whereas Sciuromorpha diverged earlier at 71.5 Mya
(63.4–80.5 Mya). The deepest bifurcations among
rodents (Sciuromorpha+Hystricomorpha, the "mouserelated clade" and Myomorpha+Anomaluromorpha) are
dated to around 77 Mya (67.9–86.8 Mya) and the origin
of order Rodentia is estimated around 79.8 Mya (71.4–
89.2 Mya).

Discussion
Removal of fast-evolving sites and contribution to rodent
phylogeny
The objective of removing fast-evolving positions was first
to identify and improve the signal to noise ratio in all
three different datasets (mitochondrial, exon and intron
fragments) that showed different patterns of evolutionary
rates. The first conclusion we reached, in agreement with
Rodriguez-Espelata et al. [37], is that fast-evolving sites are
positively correlated with saturation and these sites also
suffer the most from compositional bias. In most
instances the elimination of these sites resulted in better
supported relationships among rodent suborders. There
was also an indirect indication of an increase in the phylogenetic signal for all partitions tested, as measured by
base composition and saturation analyses (Table 3).
However, the indiscriminate removal of fast evolving sites
actually decreased the phylogenetic resolution in some
instances (for example when both categories 7 and 8 were
removed).

We observed that the proportion of fastest sites is greater
in introns than in the other two data sets (18.5% for
introns vs 12% for exon and mitochondrial genes) as the
non-coding introns are under less selection. Nonetheless,
removing of fast-evolving positions had little impact on
gamma rate distribution (Table 2) and also the global heterogeneity as measured by the alpha parameter. This
result is not really surprising because mitochondrial and
exonic regions are characterized by much contrasted categories among sites with numerous positions (nearly 40%)
that do not vary (rate category 1). Removal of the few fastest positions (rate category 8) does not really influence the
overall distribution. A more uniform distribution of evolutionary rates is one reason for making introns valuable
evolutionary markers (see also [48]) especially when compared to mitochondrial and exonic genes which encompass a big proportion of invariable sites alternating with a
relatively large proportion of fast-evolving positions.
These categories are either useless (invariable sites) or
problematic (homoplasy in fast-evolving sites) for reconstructing phylogenetic relationships.
The removal of the fast-evolving positions improved support for a number of nodes but at different taxonomic levels. For introns, the reduced dataset improved the basal
split among rodent suborders (node I in Additional file 4)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/321

whereas for mitochondrial and exonic regions, support is
increased at the more terminal nodes (C, E or G in Additional file 4). Our interpretation is that removing the fastest positions cannot totally eliminate saturation (see
Table 3) and thus, elimination of fast-evolving sites can
improve the support only for nodes that are moderately
affected by homoplasy (in our data set the deepest node
for introns and more recent nodes for exons and mitochondrial genes).
With the two probabilistic methods of tree reconstruction,
no substantial changes in the topology were observed
between the whole and reduced concatenated datasets.
Pisani [39] suggested that more sophisticated and realistic
models of evolution can lead to a more robust topology.
With MP analyses, the complete matrix suggests a grouping Sciuromorpha + "mouse-like clade" whereas the
reduced dataset clustered Hystricomorpha with Sciuromorpha, which corresponds to the topology obtained
using ML and BI reconstructions. Following the arguments proposed by Bergsten [49], these conflicting topologies might suggest that the MP tree (observed with the
whole dataset) could result from long branch attraction as
this "artefact" disappears when fast-evolving sites are
removed. Strikingly, the reduced datasets contributed to a
significant improvement when testing alternative topologies (see Table 5). Elimination of some noise in the data
leads to better discrimination between the different topologies.
Our conclusion is that identification and removal of fastevolving positions has been shown to be useful in revealing some phylogenetic information previously concealed
by homoplasy [34]. Moreover, elimination of a small
number of sites (12–18% for our three datasets), particularly for introns and concatenation of markers, allows for
increase in the support for deeper nodes. This method can
effectively be useful because the deepest phylogenetic
relationships, characterized by short internal branches,
are very often the most difficult to resolve. Our recommendation would be that complete and reduced analyses
should be conducted on the same dataset, in order to
empirically confirm the presence and location of the phylogenetic signal.
Early rodent relationships and evolution of Rodentia
This study fully support the recognition of the five subordinal clades as described in Carleton and Musser [3] and
previously identified in several molecular studies
[4,11,13,19-21]. In addition to these five suborders, the
"mouse-related clade" (E-Anomaluromorpha + Myomorpha + Castorimorpha), is strongly supported by the
introns and the concatenated datasets with and without
fastest sites and the support for this clade is reinforced
with the reduced exon and mitochondrial datasets (see

Page 10 of 16

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:321

Table 4). Among this grouping, Anomaluromorpha is the
sister taxon of Myomorpha, leaving Castorimorpha as the
first offshoot in the "mouse-related clade". This branching
order is strongly supported by the complete intron dataset
and is only moderately supported by the reduced introns
or by the complete- or reduced-concatenated datasets.
Moreover, we found no indication of a basal position for
Anomaluridae as suggested by Horner et al. [27]. Interestingly, when 25% of fastest evolving mtDNA amino acid
sites were removed by Horner et al. [27] the Anomaluridae was placed as the sister taxa of Myomorpha. It is possible that the mtDNA result, placing the Anomaluridae at
different positions, may be due to incomplete taxonomic
sampling (only Anomalurus was inlcuded in the mtDNA
study). Analyses of the two mtDNA genes included in the
present study indeed reveal Anomaluromorpha included
in the "mouse-related clade" (clade E in Additional file 4).
The close phylogenetic association between Myomorpha
and Anomaluromorpha is also strongly supported in
Huchon et al. [4] and moderately supported in the papers
of Adkins et al. [19] and Waddell and Shelley [13].
Our study provides the first evidence for a monophyletic
clade comprising Hystricomorpha and Sciuromorpha and
also the first evidence that this clade represents the deepest dichotomy amongst Rodentia. This association is
mostly obtained by the intron data and also the combined
analyses. When datasets are combined in a pairwise fashion, no significant conflicting phylogenetic signal was
found between topologies derived from introns and those
derived from the other two datasets (especially after
removal of fast-evolving positions – see Table 4). Moreover, this clustering gained additional support when alternative hypotheses were compared (Table 5). Although
this clade has never been proposed based on morphological or paleontological data it has been mentioned in previous molecular studies that were mostly based on limited
taxonomic sampling for rodents [50-53]. Sciuromorpha
as the first emergence among Rodentia represents an alternative hypothesis [13,19,54] but these studies were also
based on limited taxonomic sampling. Finally, SINE data
derived from two studies [11,32] could also not conclusively resolve the basal diversifications of rodents. Taken
the data at hand, the early rodent dichotomies are complicated as also depicted by the short internal branches at the
base of the tree. Two of our intron data sets gave good support for the monophyly of Hystricomorpha + Sciuromorpha while the two others suggest a basal position for
Hystricomorpha as the first diverging rodent lineage. Considering these conflicts, we cannot rule out the possibility
that the difference in branching order is a result of independent lineage sorting [55]. Although there is no strong
phylogenetic conflict between the intron, exon and mitochondrial datasets (especially after removal of fast-evolv-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/321

ing sites), resolving the basal node in Rodentia will
require more data.
According to our molecular dating, the order Rodentia
arose during the Late Cretaceous (65–99 Mya) between
71.4 and 89.2 Mya, which places its oldest origin before
the KT boundary. This date is slightly older but comparable to the ranges suggested by Springer et al. [56] and
Huchon et al. [4]. All these molecular estimations predate
the oldest rodent fossils which are identified in the Late
Paleocene (54.8–61 Mya; [57]) and are more in agreement with a Late Cretaceous superordinal diversification
of placentals [58]. As soon as the early Eocene (49–54.8
Mya), Rodentia already appeared to be diverse and was
present on all continents with the exception of South
America [8]. Our date estimates are compatible with an
early contemporaneous explosion of rodent diversity
(roughly at the KT boundary) that gave rise to the five suborders (Myomorpha, Hystricomorpha, Anomaluromorpha, Castorimorpha, and Sciuromorpha).
One of the earliest classifications of rodents was proposed
by Brandt [1] on different arrangements of the jaw musculature. Three types were recognized: sciuromorphy, myomorphy, hystricomorphy and Wood [6] added a fourth
type: protrogomorphy. These morphotypes have been recognized as homoplasious for a long time [2,6,16,59]. For
example, Marivaux et al. [12] came to the conclusion that
the hystricomorphous condition arose at least four times
independently. Based on our rodent phylogeny (Figure
2), it can be argued that these complex patterns are not
entirely homoplasious. Sciuromorphy evolved merely
twice (once in Sciuridae and once in Castorimorpha) but
it is noteworthy that the four zygommasseteric arrangements found in the Sciuromorpha clade is an unique case
among rodents since other major suprafamilial groupings
are characterized by one or two types at most. Further
detailed morphological or morphometric analyses could
now be conducted to test if a pattern shared by several
related rodent families (such as for example the hystricomorph condition of Pedetidae, Anomaluridae and Dipodidae) might be considered as real homology or if this
pattern is only reflecting morphological grades (adaptation) without any phylogenetic meaning.

Conclusion
Suprafamilial phylogenetic relationships among Rodentia
were assessed using ~7600 characters including mitochondrial as well as exon and intron nuclear DNA. For
each dataset, we determined the distribution of sites
according to eight evolutionary Gamma rates and we
assess the impact of removing fastest sites on phylogenetic
reconstructions. Our conclusion is that fast-evolving sites
are positively correlated with saturation and bias in base
composition but their removal is not sufficient to fully

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:321

eliminate homoplasy. Removing of the fastest evolving
eighth nucleotide category in each of the three dataset
resulted in improved support only for nodes moderately
affected by homoplasy: the deepest node for introns and
more recent nodes for exons and mitochondrial genes.
Our study fully support the recognition of the five subordinal clades as described in Carleton and Musser [3] but
proposed for the first time new intersubordinal clusterings. The relationship between Myomorpha and Anomaluromorpha appears well supported by the intron data in
particular whereas the association between Hystricomorpha and Sciuromorpha is better supported when the data
are combined and fast-evolving characters are excluded.

Methods
Taxon and gene sampling
All five suborders were comprehensively sampled at the
familial level apart from the monophyletic superfamily
Muroidea and the suborder Hystricognathi (Additional
file 3). Outgroups of successive relatedness were obtained
from the order Lagomorpha (3 taxa) and the more distantly related orders Primates (one species) and Cetartiodactyla (3 taxa). The complete matrix represents 30
rodents and 7 outgroups with a low amount of missing
data (Additional file 3).
Sequencing
For the present study, sequencing was performed mostly
for the intron fragments (MGF, PRKC, SPTBN and THY).
DNA was extracted from ear or liver tissue preserved in
ethanol using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc.).
Extracted DNA was used as template in PCR using primers
defined in Matthee et al. [40,46] and Eick et al. [60].

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using an
initial denaturation of 2 min at 94°C, followed by 35
cycles of 45 seconds denaturation at 94°C, 1 minute
annealing at 50°C – 55°C, 1 min extension at 72°C, and
a 10 minutes final extension at 72°C. Amplified products
were purified with a QIAquick PCR Gel Extraction Kit
(QIAGEN Inc.). Sequencing was performed with the ABI
Prism Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit, and analysed on an ABI Prism 310 or 3100 DNA
Sequencer (Genetic Analyser Applied Biosystems). Samples were edited using Sequencher 4.6 software (Gene
Codes Corporation). Sequences have been deposited at
the EMBL databank with accession numbers presented in
Additional file 3.
Alignment, partition and saturation analysis
The mitochondrial cytb, and the two nuclear exons (IRBP
and vWF) were aligned by hand with the ED editor of the
software MUST [61] by making use of codon alignment
(indels were always in multiples of three base pairs long).
For the 12S rRNA fragment, alignment was performed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/321

based on a collection of rodents previously aligned [21]
and a secondary structure model (stems and loops; [62]).
Indels were placed preferentially in loop regions. The four
intron fragments were aligned with more difficulty
because of numerous and sometimes long indels. Alignment was first performed at the familial level by aligning
all the well established monophyletic groups using T-coffee (version 5.05; [63]). These files were then combined
and further manually aligned across families and orders.
Alignment was also compared and optimized following
the different criteria outlined previously [48]. Finally,
poorly aligned positions were eliminated using the
Gblocks program (version 0.91b; [64]) with the following
options in effect: half the number of sequences for the
minimum number of sequences for a conserved position
and for a flank position (parameters 1 and 2); maximum
number of contiguous nonconserved positions set to 8
(parameter 3); minimum length of a block after gap cleaning fix to 2 (parameter 4); all gap positions can be selected
(parameter 5).
Each gene was partitioned based on its function/structure.
Coding genes (cytb, vWF and IRBP) were partitioned
according to codon positions whereas the 12s rRNA characters were separated into stems and loops. For MGF,
PRKC, SPTBN and THY, the intron and exon parts were
identified and treated separately (for details on exon/
intron bondaries see [40]). Because the exon sequences of
the introns were rather short, the 4 regions were combined and treated as a single unit (no partition).
For each partition, saturation was evaluated graphically
following the procedure of Philippe et al. [65]. For each
taxon pair, the inferred distance was calculated using the
program Treeplot of the MUST package [61] and the maximum likelihood tree (model GTR + I + G with PhyML version 2.4.4; [66]) as reference. The inferred distances were
plotted against the observed distances (program
Comp_mat of the MUST package). The slope of the regression (S) is an indication of the level of saturation: the
closer the slope to zero, the more saturated the data.
Phylogenetic reconstructions
Phylogenetic trees were constructed using parsimony
(MP) and two probabilistic approaches: maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI). MP and BI analyses were run using PAUP* (version 4b10; [67]) and
MrBayes (version 3.1.2; [68]) respectively. ML analyses
were performed using PhyML (version 2.4.4; [66]) and
RAxML (version 2.2.3; [69]). The latter was used to allow
for partitioned likelihood analyses.

With the two probabilistic methods, the choice of an adequate model of sequence evolution remains a crucial issue
(see for example [70]). The search for the optimal model,

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:321

using Modelgenerator (version 82; [71]) indicated that
the general time reversible model (GTR) was the optimal
model selected for 13 of the 16 partitions tested. Nucleotide heterogeneity of substitution rates, estimated with a
gamma distribution (G) was included in all cases whereas
a proportion of invariable sites (I) was found appropriate
for 9 of the 16 partitions (data not shown). Taking into
account that PhyML does not allow data-partitioning and
that the model choice is limited in MrBayes and RAxML,
the GTR + G model was used in all analyses, with the
gamma distribution approximated by 4 categories. An
additional proportion of invariable site (I) was also
included whenever possible (PhyML and MrBayes).
The search for the MP tree was conducted using the following options: heuristic search using random addition of
taxa with 10 replications and TBR branch swapping.
Nodal support was obtained with 1000 bootstrap replications (random addition of taxa with one replication).
With PhyML, the search for the ML tree was performed on
the global dataset and nodal support was assessed with
100 bootstrap replications generated using BIONJ starting
trees. Maximum likelihood analyses with partition (MLP)
were performed in RAxML program. The GTR + G model
(option -m GTRGAMMA) was applied to different partitions (option -q multipleModelFileName), and individual α-shape parameters, GTR-rates and base frequencies
were estimated and optimized for each partition individually. Nodal support was assessed with the bootstrap procedure (option -b bootsrapRandomNumberSeed) with
100 replications (option -# numberOfRuns). The program CONSENSE of the PHYLIP package (version 3.6;
[72]) was used to compute the consensus tree from the
100 bootstrap replications. Analyses with the software
MrBayes were performed on the partitioned data sets as
described above with independent model optimizations
for each partition. Metropolis-Coupled Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MC3) were run twice for 2,000,000 generations (for mitochondrial, exon and intron files) or
5,000,000 generations (for concatenated datasets) independently using 4 chains each (one cold and 3 heated
chains) and sampled every 100 generations. The log-likelihood stationarity was estimated graphically from .p files
of MrBayes and the burn-in was set to the first 200,000 or
500,000 generations (2000 or 5000 trees discarded).
Removal of fast-evolving sites
Fast-evolving sites were identified using the discrete
gamma rate category to which they belong [73]. We used
TREE-PUZZLE (version 5.2; [74]) to compute the most
probable assignment of rate categories for each position
(option w: mixed rate heterogeneity with one invariable
and 8 gamma rates). The analysis is based on the GTR
model and the values of the six substitution rates were
previously estimated with PhyML. Sites belonging to the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/321

eighth discrete gamma rate category represent the most
rapidly evolving positions and were removed using the
NET program in MUST [61]. The whole dataset was
treated in 3 separate concatenated files: mitochondrial
(cytb and 12S rRNA), exon (IRBP and vWF) and intron
(MGF, PRKC, SPTBN and THY, with exonic regions) files.
The estimation of site-specific rates was determined using
the tree obtained with the concatenated datasets except
that the branching order between the three main rodent
clades (E, G and H in Figure 1) were specified as a trifurcation based on their short lengths.
Departure from homogeneity in base composition of each
sequence was calculated in TREE-PUZZLE (using a 5%
level chi-square test) under the GTR + I + G model (with
substitution parameters first estimated with PhyML). The
level of saturation of each partition (as estimated by the
slope of the linear regression: see above) was compared
before and after removal of fast-evolving sites.
Test of alternative hypotheses
The best topology was compared to several alternative
hypotheses using PAML (version 3.15; [75]) and CONSEL
(version 0.1i; [76]). Tests were conducted on concatenated datasets (before and after removal of fast-evolving
sites) with PAML and the GTR + G model was applied to
the different partitions with independent parameter estimations (option G Mgene = 4). Log-likelihoods of sitepattern trees (.lnf file) were then used by CONSEL to calculate the P-values for several statistical tests for which
only the AU (approximately unbiased) test, SH (Shimodaira-Hasagawa) test and the PP (approximate Bayesian
posterior probability) are presented here.
Molecular dating
Divergence times were estimated using the relaxed Bayesian molecular clock implemented in MULTIDISTRIBUTE
(version 09.25.03; [77]). The software allow for multilocus analyses with autocorrelation of rates. We used the
reduced-concatenated dataset partitioned in 8 partitions,
including the first and second codon positions for the cytb
(the third position was not included because sequences
were too divergent for calculating distances with PAML),
the entire 12s rRNA, three codon positions for the 2 concatenated exons, and 2 partitions for the intron dataset:
the four introns combined and the exonic regions combined. We used the topology obtained with the concatenated-reduced dataset (Figure 1) as input. Model
parameters were firstly estimated for each partition with
PAML using the F84 substitution model with a five-category gamma distribution. Then, estimation of branch
lengths and their variance-covariance matrix were performed with the ESTBRANCHES program. Thirdly,
MULTIDIVTIME allows estimating divergence times and
their variance and the following priors were used: 100 Myr

as a prior expected time between tip and root (approximate age of the eutherian radiation; [58]), 0.0003 (calculated as the median of branch lengths over the 8 resulting
trees divided by the root age; see MULTIDIVTIME guidelines) as prior distribution for rate at root node, and 0.5 as
the mean of the prior for autocorrelation rate parameter
along branches. For all parameters, standard deviation
equals the value of the parameter. Markov chain Monte
Carlo analyses were run for 1,000,000 generations sampled every 100 generations with a burn-in of the first
10,000 generations.

MULTIDIVTIME allows the incorporation of multiple
time constraints as well as their uncertainties. Four calibration points were used: 1) between 28 and 35 Mya
(Early Oligocene) for the origin of the Heteromyidae and
Geomyidae families [8,57]; 2) 37 Mya as the lower bound
for the split between Aplodontidae and Sciuridae [57]; 3)
between 28 and 50 Mya for the origin of modern glirid
lineages (Graphiurus and Dryomys; [8,57]); 4) between 49
and 55 Myr (Early Eocene) for the split between ochotonids and leporids [78].
