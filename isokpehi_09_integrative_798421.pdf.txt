Abstract
Background: Proteins that selectively transport water across the membranes of cells are
recognized as important in the normal functioning of the body systems of vertebrates. There are
13 known mammalian aquaporins (AQP0 to AQP12), some of which have been shown to have
unexpected cellular roles beyond transmembrane water transport. The availability of nonmammalian vertebrate animal models has the potential to provide insight into the emergence of
diverse function in the aquaporins. The domesticated chicken (Gallus gallus) is the premier avian
model for biological research; however, only a limited number of studies have compared chicken
and mammalian aquaporins. The identification of aquaporins that share functional motifs or are
expressed in the same tissues in human and chicken could allow the further functional analyses of
homologous aquaporins in both species. We hypothesize that integrative analyses of protein
sequences and body site expression of human, mouse, rat and chicken aquaporins has the potential
to yield novel biological hypotheses about the unexpected cellular roles of aquaporins beyond
transmembrane water transport.
Results: A total of 76 aquaporin transcript models derived from 47 aquaporin genes were
obtained for human, mouse, rat and chicken. Eleven body sites (brain, connective tissue, head,
heart, liver, muscle, ovary, pancreas, small intestine, spleen and testis) were identified in which
there is suggested expression of at least one mammalian and one chicken aquaporin. This study
demonstrates that modern on-line analysis tools, a novel matrix integration technique, and the
availability of the chicken genome for comparative genomics and expression analysis enables
hypothesis generation in several important areas including: (i) alternative transcription and
speciation effects on the conservation of functional motifs in vertebrate aquaporins; (ii) the
emergence of basolateral targeting in mammalian species; (iii) the potential of the cysteine-rich
AQP11 as a possible target in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as autism

that involve Purkinje cells; and (iv) possible impairment of function of pancreas-expressed AQP12
during pancreatotropic necrosis in avian influenza virus infection.
Conclusion: The investigation of aquaporin function in chicken and mammalian species has the
potential to accelerate the discovery of novel knowledge of aquaporins in both avian and
mammalian species.

Background
Proteins that selectively transport water across the membranes of cells are recognized as important in normal
functioning of the body systems of vertebrates. These
homologous proteins are collectively referred to as
aquaporins and include a subset called aquaglyceroporins
that are able to transport glycerol, urea and other small
solutes in addition to water [1]. There are 13 known mammalian aquaporins (AQP0 to AQP12). These aquaporins
vary in tissue and developmental expression across mammalian species and unexpected cellular roles for the
aquaporins beyond transmembrane water transport have
been identified [2]. However, the cellular and molecular
strategies for these roles are not completely understood.
The water-only aquaporins are AQP0, AQP1, AQP2,
AQP4, AQP5, AQP6 and AQP8, while aquaglyceroporins
are AQP3, AQP7, AQP9 and AQP10 [1]. The transport
specificities and roles of AQP11 and AQP12 in health and
disease are not completely described [1,3-5]. Aquaporins
typically have six transmembrane regions and five loops
(A to E) with two characteristic Asparagine-ProlineAlanine (NPA) motifs in loops B and E (Figure 1) [6].

Figure 1
Topology of an aquaporin protein within the membrane
Topology of an aquaporin protein within the membrane. The protein consists of six transmembrane helices (IVI) connected by five loops (A-E) and includes two internal
tandem repeats (I-III and IV-VI, respectively). Loops B and E,
containing the conserved NPA motifs (in the single-letter
amino-acid code), form short α helices that fold back into
the membrane from opposite sides. C, carboxyl terminus; N,
amino terminus. Figure reproduced from [6].

Based on the number of citations in PubMed, avian
aquaporins have been poorly investigated compared to
those of human, mouse and rat [7].
The domesticated chicken Gallus gallus is the premier
avian model for biological research [8-10]. Furthermore,
the publication of the chicken genome and availability of
large-scale gene expression data presents new opportunities to compare the expression of avian and mammalian
aquaporin genes. Mammalian aquaporins function in
diverse biological processes including development of
lens, inner ear, teeth and oral facial tissues; maintenance
of sperm motility; synthesis and secretion of milk; and
urine concentration. In addition, malfunction of mammalian aquaporins have been implicated in diverse disease processes such as altered fat metabolism, brain
edema, cancer, congenital cataract, dry mouth, dry skin,
infertility, hearing loss, nephrogenic diabetes, renal failure, and wet lung syndrome [11]. This broad range of
pathologies linked to altered aquaporin expression has
further supported the potential of aquaporins as drug targets for water-transport related disorders [12].
Apart from transmembrane/epithelial water transport,
recently suggested unexpected cellular roles of mammalian aquaporins include cell migration, cell volume regulation, mitochondria metabolism, neural signal
transduction, renal glycerol clearance and vesicular swelling [11,13]. The co-expression of several members of the
aquaporin gene family in the same tissue such as small
intestine [14] makes it difficult to determine their individual role apart from trans-epithelial water transport. It is
not clear whether alternative transcription/splicing of an
aquaporin gene to produce more than one isoform contributes to these unexpected cellular roles. Mice with deficient or mutated aquaporin are currently used as models
to study novel cellular roles of human aquaporins [11].
There is an increasing need to have alternative non-mammalian models for aquaporin function in humans [14].
The chick optic tectum has been used to investigate the
role of AQP4 in blood brain barrier development [15].
Furthermore, in chick lens development, AQP0 interacts
with lens-fiber gap junctions during lens development
[16].
There are a limited numbers of reports that have compared the body site expression of chicken and mammalian

aquaporins. Comparison of nucleotide sequences of
chicken AQP2, AQP4 and AQP5 to their rat and human
orthologs has revealed an overall identity of 75–90% and
similarity in tissue distribution [7]. AQP9 has not been
shown to be expressed in mammalian kidney, but recently
found expressed in young chicken kidney [17]. In addition, water-deprivation in early development of rodents
and chicken results in upregulation of the kidney AQP2
[17,18]. The distribution of AQP4 in the circumventricular organs of chicken and rat brains have been compared
[19]. Taken together, the identification of aquaporins that
share sequence similarity or are expressed in identical tissues in human and chicken could allow the further functional analyses of aquaporins in avian species.
The objectives of the investigation reported in this article
were to (1) determine the impact of alternative transcription and speciation on functional motifs of aquaporin
gene transcript models predicted from the genomes of
human, mouse, rat and chicken; and (2) determine body
sites common to human, mouse, rat and chicken with
suggested aquaporin expression. We hypothesize that
integrative analyses of protein sequences and body site
expression of human, mouse, rat and chicken aquaporins
has the potential to yield novel biological hypotheses
about the unexpected cellular roles of aquaporins beyond
transmembrane water transport. Our high-throughput
comparative sequence analysis revealed the potential
impact of alternative transcription and speciation on the
conservation of functional motifs in human, mouse, rat
and chicken aquaporins. Furthermore, by using controlled vocabulary of terms describing body sites in the UniGene database, an integrated view of suggested tissue
expression of aquaporins for these four organisms was
generated.
The integrative analyses of protein sequences and tissue
expression profiles presented in this article provides novel
insights into the potential function of cysteine-rich
AQP11 in the pathophysiology of autism and evidence for
involvement of pancreas-expressed AQP12 in the pathology of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus infections.
The investigation of aquaporin function in chicken could
accelerate the discovery of novel knowledge on human
aquaporins especially during early development.

Results
Comparison of predicted aquaporin transcripts from
human, mouse, rat and chicken
In order to determine the impact of alternative transcription as well as speciation on the conservation of functional motifs in aquaporins, we first compiled the
aquaporin types with entries in the Entrez Gene [20] and
Ensembl [21] genomic resources (Table 1) for human,
mouse, rat and chicken. This dataset provided the basis for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S2/S7

comparative sequence analysis of the transcripts predicted
in the Ensembl genome resource. Multiple sequence
alignment was performed on each aquaporin type in
which at least one mammalian and one chicken transcript
were available. A total of 76 sequences were retrieved from
the Ensembl. Multiple sequence alignments for each
aquaporin type are available as Additional File 1. A summary of the number of transcripts examined for 9
aquaporin types and key observations from sequence
alignment are presented in Table 2. The impact of alternative transcription and speciation of these vertebrate
aquaporins on the conservation of the two water-transport motifs is summarized in Table 3. We further describe
below the results obtained for AQP3, AQP4, AQP11 and
AQP12.
Three human transcripts were retrieved for AQP3 and one
each for mouse, rat and chicken from the Ensembl (Figure
2). The protein isoform from human AQP3 transcript
ENST00000379492 lacked the first 34 amino acids
present in the other isoforms. This region contained the
YRLL motif known to be important for basolateral sorting
in epithelial cells [22-24]. The YRLL motif was replaced by
a NKLV motif in the only chicken isoform obtained from
transcript ENSGALT00000003868. The first NPA motif
was conserved in all the AQP3 isoforms while the second
NPA motif was absent in two human AQP3 isoform
sequences (ENST00000343952 and ENST00000379492).
The impact of alternative transcription and speciation is
illustrated by protein features predicted for the three
human AQP3 transcripts and one chicken AQP transcript
(Figure 3). Note the difference in number of transmembrane helices predicted for the human transcripts. Interestingly, the chicken transcript lacks a prediction for signal
peptide. This observation led us to further analyze the
Ensembl generated pairwise sequence alignments of the
chicken AQP3 with other vertebrate AQP3 showing 1-to1
ortholog
prediction.
The
AQP3
(ENSOANG00000014661) of the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) had a YKLL motif aligned to the NKLV
motif of the chicken sequence (Figure 4).
AQP4 was the only aquaporin type in which the four
organisms had at least two transcripts. Multiple sequence
alignment of the amino acid sequences from the 9 transcripts and construction of phylogenetic tree revealed two
classes of transcripts (Figure 5). The two rat transcripts
(ENSRNOT00000048109 and ENSRNOT00000021961)
clustered with a human transcript (ENST00000383170)
and a mouse transcript (ENSMUST00000079081). In the
case of the remaining 5 AQP4 transcripts, the chicken and
mouse protein sequences were clustered with human
transcript ENST00000339532.

*Ensembl Identifiers obtained had a total of 11 numerals with the appropriate number of zeros as padding. Furthermore, the identifiers were
preceded by ENSG, ENSMUSG, ENSRNOG, and ENSGAL are for human, mouse, rat and chicken genes respectively. The isoform of Human AQP12
used for analysis was Aquaporin 12B.

In the case of AQP11, the first water transporting motif
was atypical (NPC) in all the isoforms examined. Only
three
protein
isoforms
from
transcripts
ENSRNOT00000018091, ENSMUST00000084986 and
ENST00000313578 contained the second NPA motif.
AQP11 sequences had a high number of cysteine residues
compared to other aquaporin types including a triplet
CCC present in the N-terminal of protein sequences produced
by
transcripts
ENSMUST00000055379,
ENSMUST00000084986 and ENST00000313578. The
two rat sequences had a CYC motif while chicken had a
CAC motif. Cysteine residues are known to interact with
sulfhydryl-reactive metals such as mercury, cadmium,
lead, and arsenic [25]. A total of five transcripts for AQP12
were retrieved for the four species. The protein sequence
for one of the human transcripts (ENST00000373309)
lacked the first NPA-like motif (NPT) present in the other
sequences. All contained the second NPA motif.

Body site expression profiles for human, mouse, rat and
chicken aquaporins
A total of 44 UniGene aquaporin entries from human
(13), mouse (12), rat (10) and chicken (9) were identified
has having suggested expression in at least one of 57 body
sites based on Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) counts
(Table 4). A total of 51 binary signatures described the
expression of aquaporins from the organisms compared.
The visualized matrix of signatures is presented in Figure
6. Furthermore, 11 body sites (brain, connective tissue,
head, heart, liver, muscle, ovary, pancreas, small intestine,
spleen and testis) were identified in which both chicken
and mammalian aquaporins were expressed. The brain
had the highest count for aquaporin expression. All four
organisms expressed AQP1, AQP4 and AQP11 in the
brain. There was evidence of expression of AQP12 in the
intestine, pancreas, stomach, and tongue as well as expression in the pancreas for all species except rat (Figure 6,
Additional file 2). We mapped chicken aquaporins to
body sites in order to prioritize them for further functional analysis (Table 5).

Discussion
Aquaporin cell surface proteins are emerging as important
proteins beyond water transport [2,11,13,26]. However,
the molecular, cellular and evolutionary basis for these
novel roles are not completely known. Our high-throughput comparative sequence analysis revealed the impact of
alternative transcription and speciation on the conservation of functional motifs in human, mouse, rat and
chicken aquaporins. Furthermore, by using a controlled
vocabulary of terms describing body sites in the UniGene
database, an integrated view of suggested tissue expression of aquaporins in these four organisms was generated
(Figure 6). We were unable to retrieve information from
the Ensembl database on chicken AQP2 and AQP0 (Entrez Gene ID: 374124) although chicken AQP0 (MIP) has

been studied in the context of early development of lens
fiber and its association with gap junction proteins [16].
The predicted chicken AQP6 was annotated as AQP2-like.
The annotation of AQP0, AQP2 and AQP6 from the
chicken genome warrants further investigation.
Alternate splicing of mRNA as a means of generating protein diversity can occur by exon skipping [27]. All the 76
aquaporins transcripts analyzed were multi-exon transcripts and could be subject to alternative splicing with
impact on protein function. For the nine aquaporin types
compared, our sequence alignments uncovered
aquaporin isoforms that lacked one of the two watertransport motifs (Table 3). We hypothesize that isoforms
lacking one of the two NPA or NPA-like motifs character-

istic will have impaired or abolished water transport function. They are also candidates for investigating roles other
than water function. Another mechanism for variation
that can impact function of aquaporins is single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Previous work has demonstrated that novel genetic variants of AQP4 resulting from
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) showed reduced
water permeability [28]. We observed from the Ensembl
database (Release 50 July 2008) that a total of 19 reference
SNPs were mapped to the following chicken aquaporins:
AQP1, AQP7, AQP8, AQP9 and AQP12. As the chicken
genome become further characterized for polymorphisms, it may become possible to gain insights into
impact of SNP variation on aquaporin function and
organism phenotype.
Most proteins that target the plasma membrane contain
signals within their cytoplasmic termini that permit their
recruitment into endocytic vesicles, which in turn facilitates their selective compartmentalization in the apical or
basolateral membranes selectively [23]. We were interested in identifying avian protein isoforms in which the
functional motifs were different from mammalian
aquaporin isoforms. We have previously investigated the
compartmentalization of AQP3 and AQP10 in the human
intestine in which we observed that the basolateral sorting
motif "YRLL" is present in AQP3 but absent in AQP10
[22]. Based on the UniGene suggested expression profiles
there was no suggestion for the expression of chicken

AQP3 in the intestine. Furthermore, the signal peptide for
targeting was not predicted for chicken AQP3 in the
Ensembl resource (Figure 3). Tissue expression for this
chicken AQP3 was suggested for head, liver, and ovary.
Comparative sequence analysis provided evidence that
chicken AQP3 lacks the YRLL motif (NKLV was observed)
suggesting that it may not be targeted to the basolateral
membrane of the intestine. The multiple sequence alignment of the AQP3 protein sequences from the four organisms revealed that the amino acids immediately before
and after the YRLL and NKLV motifs were conserved (Figure 2).
According to the ProTeus (PROtein TErminUS) tool [29],
the NKLV protein signature is a short linear significant signature in termini of proteins with a corresponding Gene
Ontology Cellular Component of "extracellular". Based
on alignments available at the Ensembl resource [21] for
AQP3 from fish (Danio rerio, Oryzias latipes, Takifugu
rubripes, and Tetraodon nigroviridis) and an amphibian
(Xenopus tropicalis), the ancestral motifs of the sorting
motifs found in human may be NKLL or NMLM (Figure
4). Thus, the presence of the amino acid tyrosine (Y) in
this sorting tetrapeptide in the platypus suggests the point
in the evolution of AQP3 where the asparagine residue
was replaced by the critical tyrosine required for sorting
function [30]. The genome of O. anatinus has been proposed has useful for informing human genome sequence
and critical link to understanding the differences between
avian and mammalian genomes [31,32]. These observations provide novel evolutionarily insights into the localization signals encoded in the termini of AQP3.
We have used a binary encoding integration strategy to
gain a comprehensive view of suggested tissue expression
of aquaporins for four organisms. Higher-order patterns
in a binary vector space that encodes the presence (1) or
absence (0) of feature of interest is an approach for integrating genome-wide numerical datasets [33-35]. Several
advantages offered by the binary integration of highthroughput gene expression data include computational
efficiency and noise resilience [35]. Our matrix revealed
that AQP4, in addition to AQP1 and AQP11 were
expressed in the brain of all the four organisms. These
three aquaporin types are candidates for comparative
experimental investigation of aquaporin in brain function. In addition, the analysis delivered a set of body sites
in which there was evidence of expression of at least one
mammalian aquaporin and chicken aquaporin.
The functions of AQP11 and AQP12 in vertebrate physiology are not completely understood [1,3]. We observed
that AQP11 had the highest number of cysteine residues
compared to other aquaporins. AQP11 is expressed in the
Purkinje cells of the brain cerebellar [1], a site that have

Conclusion
This study demonstrates that the chicken genome combined with a comprehensive controlled vocabulary-facilitated integration of UniGene suggested body site
expression can drive generation of hypotheses related to
the function of avian and mammalian aquaporins. We
describe the generation of hypotheses related to (i) the
impact of alternative transcription and speciation on the
conservation of functional motifs in human, mouse, rat
and chicken aquaporins; (ii) identification of the emergence of basolateral targeting in mammalian species (iii)
possibility of cysteine-rich AQP11 as target in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders; and (iv)
impact on the function of pancreas-expressed AQP12 during pancreatotropic necrosis associated with avian influenza virus infection.

Methods
been implicated in the pathophysiology of autism
[36,37]. Exposure of chick embryo to the environmental
metal pollutant methylmercury led to reduction in the
number of Purkinje cells [38]. Furthermore, there were
adverse post-natal behavioral, morphological and biochemical consequences. Mercury ions are known to regulate aquaporin function by interacting with cysteine
residues [39,40]. Interestingly, the first pore forming
motif of AQP11 found in Loop B has a motif of NPC
instead of the NPA. However, the second motif is NPA
consistent with other AQPs. AQP11 is the only human
aquaporin with the tri-cysteine (CCC) motif. These observations led us to hypothesize that AQP11 may be a target
in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders
like autism. We are currently studying the specificity and
affinity of a range of cations to further understand the
interaction of cations with aquaporins in the function of
the central nervous system. With the availability of the
chicken genome, the chick embryo has the potential to
serve as an important model for the study of the development of neurodegenerative disorders [38,41].
In the case of AQP12, there was suggested expression in
the pancreas of human, mouse and chicken (Table 4) with
chicken having the highest expression level. AQP12 is
localized intracellularly in the pancreatic acinar cells, the
site for synthesis of digestive enzymes [3]. Histopathological studies have confirmed that the highly pathogenic
H5N1 virus that causes avian influenza in chicken and
other avian species causes multifocal necrosis in the pancreatic acinar cells suggesting that the effect of avian influenza on the function of AQP12 warrants further
investigation.

Comparison of predicted aquaporin transcripts from
human, mouse, rat and chicken
Predictions of genes encoding aquaporins from human,
mouse, rat and chicken genomes were obtained from the
Ensembl project (Release 50 July 2008) [21] and the Entrez Gene database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [20]. In both databases, the

human aquaporin information was used as the starting
point to extract predicted homologous proteins in the
other three species. The amino acid sequences encoding
predicted transcripts associated with aquaporin genes in
which both an Ensembl and Entrez Gene record exist were
further compared. We sought to determine the conservation of functional motifs among predicted transcripts
from orthologous genes. Therefore, the amino acid
sequence diversity encoded by aquaporin transcripts was
determined by multiple sequence alignment of orthologs
using ClustalW. In order to visualize the relationship of
selected sequences, neighbor-joining tree bootstrapped
using 1,000 random samples of sites from the alignment
was constructed using the ClustalW software at the DNA
Data Bank of Japan [42]. FigTree software version 1.12
[43] was used to view the phylogenetic trees.
UniGene expression profiles for human, mouse, rat and
chicken aquaporins
Each NCBI UniGene Cluster contains set of transcript
sequences that appear to come from the same transcription locus (gene or expressed pseudogene) as well as other
information including expression profile in body sites

and developmental stages [20]. The UniGene cluster identifier for each of the aquaporins was extracted from the
Entrez Gene record and verified manually. In instances
where more than one UniGene entry was associated the
Entrez Gene, the unambiguous UniGene entry was
selected. The value of the Transcript per million (TPM) for
each body site was programmatically extracted from the
UniGene Expression Profile Viewer page.
There was need to identify chicken and mammalian
aquaporins that were expressed in the same body site
based on controlled vocabulary term used in UniGene.
Therefore, a 4-digit binary signature was constructed to
encode the presence or absence of species aquaporin
expression. Thus a matrix consisting of 52-digit binary signature and the number of body sites was constructed and
visualized using matrix2png [44].
