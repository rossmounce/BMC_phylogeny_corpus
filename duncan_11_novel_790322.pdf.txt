Novel male-biased expression in paralogs of the
aphid slimfast nutrient amino acid transporter
expansion
Rebecca P Duncan1, Lubov Nathanson2 and Alex CC Wilson1*

Abstract
Background: A major goal of molecular evolutionary biology is to understand the fate and consequences of
duplicated genes. In this context, aphids are intriguing because the newly sequenced pea aphid genome harbors
an extraordinary number of lineage-specific gene duplications relative to other insect genomes. Though many of
their duplicated genes may be involved in their complex life cycle, duplications in nutrient amino acid transporters
appear to be associated rather with their essential amino acid poor diet and the intracellular symbiosis aphids rely
on to compensate for dietary deficits. Past work has shown that some duplicated amino acid transporters are
highly expressed in the specialized cells housing the symbionts, including a paralog of an aphid-specific expansion
homologous to the Drosophila gene slimfast. Previous data provide evidence that these bacteriocyte-expressed
transporters mediate amino acid exchange between aphids and their symbionts.
Results: We report that some nutrient amino acid transporters show male-biased expression. Male-biased
expression characterizes three paralogs in the aphid-specific slimfast expansion, and the male-biased expression is
conserved across two aphid species for at least two paralogs. One of the male-biased paralogs has additionally
experienced an accelerated rate of non-synonymous substitutions.
Conclusions: This is the first study to document male-biased slimfast expression. Our data suggest that the malebiased aphid slimfast paralogs diverged from their ancestral function to fill a functional role in males. Furthermore,
our results provide evidence that members of the slimfast expansion are maintained in the aphid genome not only
for the previously hypothesized role in mediating amino acid exchange between the symbiotic partners, but also
for sex-specific roles.

Background
A fundamental goal of molecular evolutionary biology is to
understand the evolutionary fate and biological consequences of duplicated genes. Most duplicate genes fail to
reach fixation [1], strongly suggesting that retained gene
duplicates provide a selective advantage. Recent genome
sequencing projects have revealed that the water flea,
Daphnia pulex, and the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum,
are unique among arthropods in having exceptionally high
levels of tandem, lineage-specific gene duplication and
retention [2-9]. Apart from high gene duplication levels,
both Daphnia and aphids, in contrast to other sequenced
insects, are cyclical parthenogens with complex life cycles

characterized by extensive polyphensim [2,3]. The shared
life cycle complexity and gene duplication levels of aphids
and Daphnia suggest that polyphenism may be a major
factor underlying the extensive gene duplications characterizing these two genomes.
Several aphid-specific gene family expansions have
been suggested to be associated with the aphid life cycle
and polyphenism [3]. For example, several genes involved
in early developmental signaling pathways have undergone aphid-specific duplications [4], which may account
for the differences observed in embryonic development
between live-bearing, asexual females and egg-laying, sexual females [4,10]. One major developmental difference
between asexual and sexual females is the type of cell
division that initiates oogenesis. While sexual female
oocytes undergo standard meiosis, asexual female oocytes

undergo a modified form of meiosis before initiating
development of a parthenogenetic embryo [11]. The differences in cell division between asexual and sexual
female oocytes might be accommodated by gene duplications found in cell cycle genes, some of which are differentially expressed in sexual and asexual female ovarioles
[11]. Additionally, since different morphs within the
same clonal line are genetically identical, their morphological, biological and ecological differences must result
from differences in gene expression [e.g. [12]], which
may be facilitated by duplicate, divergent chromatin
remodeling genes [6].
In contrast to an hypothesized association with polyphenism, some aphid-specific gene duplications appear to
be more connected with other aspects of aphid biology,
such as their diet. Aphids feed on plant phloem sap, a diet
rich in sugar, which creates a high positive osmotic potential between the ingested phloem sap and the aphid hemolymph. This osmotic challenge must be overcome in order
for aphids to avoid desiccation [8,13]. Aphids cope with
their osmotically challenging diet both by voiding excess
sugar as liquid waste called honeydew [14], and by transporting sugars across the gut epithelium into their hemolymph via sugar transporter proteins [8]. Interestingly,
aphid sugar transporters have undergone aphid-specific
gene duplications [8], which may enable aphids to utilize a
sugar rich diet.
Another group of diet-associated genes that have undergone aphid-specific duplications are the nutrient amino
acid transporters [9]. Duplications in nutrient amino acid
transporters may be explained by another feature of the
aphid phloem sap diet. Apart from being rich in sugar,
phloem sap is also deficient in essential amino acids.
Essential amino acids cannot be synthesized de novo by
metazoans, so their deficit in phloem is compensated for
by the intracellular bacterial symbiont, Buchnera aphidicola [15,16]. Buchnera reside within membrane-bound
compartments in specialized aphid cells called bacteriocytes, where they exchange non-essential amino acids
from the aphid for the essential amino acids they synthesize [reviewed in [16]]. Recently, we discovered that some
nutrient amino acid transporters are highly expressed in
bacteriocyte cells where Buchnera reside, suggesting that
these amino acid transporters mediate amino acid
exchange between aphids and Buchnera [9]. Our finding
that bacteriocyte-enriched amino acid transporters are
often members of gene family expansions suggests that
past duplication events enabled some duplicates to conserve their ancestral function while others diverged to fill a
role in symbiosis [9].
Here we propose that in addition to a role in symbiosis,
duplicate nutrient amino acid transporters have evolved
sex-biased roles. In microarray data for the aphid species
Myzus persicae, we unexpectedly discovered that two

Page 2 of 12

nutrient amino acid transporters have highly male-biased
expression. These transporters, orthologous to the Drosophila gene slimfast, were nested within an aphid-specific
slimfast expansion among 10 A. pisum paralogs. Malebiased expression for these two paralogs is conserved in
A. pisum and detailed expression analysis in A. pisum
revealed one additional male-biased slimfast paralog and
one asexual female-biased slimfast paralog. Together,
these data suggest that, in addition to the symbiosisbased functions proposed by Price et al., [9], the aphidspecific slimfast expansion is maintained for sex-biased
functions.

Results
Microarray and automated annotation results

We mined a microarray comparing expression between
male, sexual female, and asexual female Myzus persicae
aphids for genes with differential expression between
males and at least one female morph (i.e. genes that
were not sex-neutral). Comparisons were made with
two types of asexual females: asexual females from perpetually parthenogenetic cultures requiring higher temperatures and long day lengths (long day asexual
females) and asexual females collected from sexual cultures, induced by lower temperatures and shortened day
lengths (short day asexual females). Comparing males
and sexual females to both long and short day asexual
females enabled us to control for day length effects in
gene expression (since sexual morphs are only present
under short day conditions).
Genes with differential expression between males and at
least one female reproductive morph are referred to as
“male-enriched” or “female-enriched”. These sex-enriched
genes were identified by fold change (4-fold or greater
upregulation) and significance (False discovery rate (FDR)
< 0.05). Of the 10,478 M. persicae unigenes represented
on the microarray, 768 (~7%) were male-enriched and 725
(~7%) were female-enriched (Additional file 1; a list of all
sex-enriched genes with descriptions, annotations and fold
changes can be found in Additional files 2 and 3). Of the
male-enriched genes, 126 (16%) were overexpressed in
males relative to all three female morphs and of the
female-enriched genes, 82 (11%) were enriched in all three
female morphs relative to males. We refer to genes that
are differentially expressed between males and all three
female reproductive morphs as “male-biased” or “femalebiased”. One gene was enriched in both sexes depending
upon the female morph: contig 2728 (see Additional file 4
for corresponding EST accession numbers) was overexpressed in males relative to sexual females and overexpressed in asexual females relative to males (Additional
files 1, 2, and 3).
Mapping and annotation results obtained from Blast2GO are summarized in Additional file 1. The homology

Duncan et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:253
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/253

search returned significant BLAST hits for 501 (65%)
male-enriched and 554 (76%) female-enriched genes.
Gene Ontology (GO) terms were found for 371 (48%)
male-enriched and 414 (57%) female-enriched genes.
Round one annotation, which excluded electronic annotations, annotated 202 (26%) male-enriched and 291
(40%) female-enriched genes. Round two annotation,
which included electronic annotations, annotated an
additional 63 (8%) male-enriched and 51 (7%) femaleenriched genes. InterProScan [17] added annotations to
genes annotated in the previous steps and additionally
annotated 42 (5%) male-enriched and 31 (4%) femaleenriched genes that were previously unannotated. Annotations were assigned to a total of 307 (40%) male-enriched
and 373 (51%) female-enriched genes (Additional file 1).
Overrepresented GO terms are presented in Additional
file 5. In total, 75 GO terms were significantly overrepresented in sex-enriched genes (FDR < 0.05). Of these GO
terms, 16 (21%) were overrepresented in males and 59
(79%) in females. Female-enriched genes were represented by several GO classes such as nucleotide binding,
nitrogen metabolism, cell cycle, cytoskeleton organization
and organelles. In contrast, male-enriched genes were
dominated by GO terms related to transporter and channel activity (Additional file 5).

Identification and annotation of sex-enriched nutrient
amino acid transporters in the aphid Myzus persicae

From the sex-enriched genes identified in the microarray,
we identified five nutrient amino acid transporters overexpressed 4.2-fold to 20.1-fold in males (FDR < 0.05; Table 1
and Additional file 3). Four of the five male-enriched
transporters were annotated in Blast2GO based on GO
terms associated with significant BLAST hits (E < 0.001)
and/or InterProScan IDs (Table 1 Additional file 3). The
fifth transporter had no BLAST hits associated with GO
terms, but its one InterProScan ID was annotated as
belonging to transmembrane amino acid transporters
(Table 1). After translating unigene nucleotide sequences
to amino acid sequences based on the largest open reading
frame, four of the five transporters significantly matched
Pfam domains AA_permease (PF000324) or Aa_trans
(PF01490) (Table 1).
Two transporters (contigs 1492 and 8321; See Additional file 4 for the GenBank accession numbers) were
overexpressed 5.7 to 20.1-fold in males relative to both
sexual and asexual females (Table 1 Additional file 3).
We further annotated these two transporters based on
their strongly male-biased expression. Using BLASTX
and reciprocal TBLASTN searches, M. persicae contig

acid permease ACYPI005156 were reciprocal BLAST best
hits. These two genes also paired with unambiguous support in a gene phylogeny for insect orthologs to the Drosophilia gene slimfast, a cationic amino acid permease
[18] of which A. pisum has a ten paralog aphid-specific
expansion [9] (Figure 1). A BLASTX search for the other
M. persicae contig, 8321 (Table 1 and Additional file 4),
against the A. pisum nr protein database returned the A.
pisum gene ACYPI003240 as the best hit, but the reciprocal TBLASTN search failed to return contig 8321 as
the best hit for ACYPI003240. Phylogenetic analysis
paired contig 8321 and ACYPI003240 with unambiguous
support in the slimfast gene phylogeny (Figure 1). Based
on the homology of the aphid expansion to slimfast, we
named the 10 A. pisum paralogs ACYPIslif1-10 (Table 2).
Intrigued by having identified male-enriched nutrient
amino acid transporters, we sought to discover if more
sex-enriched amino acid transporters were represented in
the microarray that our annotation pipeline had failed to
annotate. TBLASTX and BLASTN searches queried all 40
A. pisum nutrient amino acid transporters [as identified in
9] against the M. persicae unigenes in the microarray.
Apart from the 5 male-enriched transporters annotated
above, we uncovered 9 additional contigs with significant
(E < 0.001) similarity to A. pisum nutrient amino acid
transporters. Of these 9 contigs, 5 were significantly (FDR
< 0.05) male-enriched (two of which were male-biased)

and 3 were female-enriched. Fold change for most of these
contigs was less than four, explaining why we did not
identify them in our initial analysis. In total, the M. persicae microarray targeted 14 contigs that significantly
matched nutrient amino acid transporters, of which 10
were male-enriched or male-biased and 3 were femaleenriched.
Sex-biased expression in the aphid slimfast expansion

In our survey for more amino acid transporters in the
microarray, we found no additional slimfast paralogs. We
thus shifted the focus of our study to A. pisum so as to
leverage its sequenced genome [3] to analyze the evolution
of male-biased aphid slimfast. Expression was quantified
by quantitative PCR (QPCR) between males and the three
female morphs across three biological replicates. Expression was quantified for all slimfast paralogs but three, for
which sequence similarity and AT richness in the untranslated regions prevented the design of paralog-specific
primers [9].
Expression results are presented as a heat map aligned
against the slimfast gene phylogeny in Figure 2. Paralogs
ACYPIslif5, 6, and 10 were male-biased, with ACYPIslif5
and 6 showing the highest male-biased expression (Average fold change ± SD = 5.0 ± 2.2) and ACYPIslif10 showing less upregulation in males (Average fold change ± SD
= 2.0 ± 0.5). Expression patterns for male-biased genes
were consistent across all biological replicates (Figure 2).
Additional patterns that were consistent across the three
biological replicates were (1) enriched expression for
ACYPIslif8 in asexual females at long day and (2) consistent low expression across all morphs for ACYPIslif9.
Molecular evolution of male-biased slimfast paralogs

The expression profiles of each slimfast paralog inspired
the molecular evolutionary models we used to test if
branches leading to male-biased paralogs experienced
accelerated rates of evolution. Four codon-based branch
models (depicted in Figure 3) [19,20] were constructed

Figure 2 Quantitative gene expression analysis of Acyrthosiphon pisum slimfast paralogs. Gene expression profiles are shown for three A.
pisum lineages (LSR1, 7A, 9-2-1). Transcript levels for each slimfast paralog were quantified by QPCR on cDNA for whole adult asexual females at
long day (AFL) and short day (AFS), sexual females (SF), and males (M). The relative abundance of each paralog was normalized to the
housekeeping gene GAPDH (ACYPI009769) and expression levels were standardized by converting them to z-scores and compiled into a heat
map (for details, see methods). Expression was not quantified for ACYPIslif1-3 because sequence similarity and AT richness in the untranslated
regions precluded our ability to design paralog-specific QPCR primers. Aphid line 9-2-1 does not produce asexual females at short day so we did
not measure AFS expression for 9-2-1 (see methods for details). Yellow: z > 0; Blue: z < 0.

to test for differences in the ratio of non-synonymous to
synonymous substitution rates along specific branches
(dN/dS = ω). The null model (one ratio) assumed equal
ω for all branches. The first alternative model (two
ratios) assumed different ω ratios for branches within
and outside the aphid-specific slimfast expansion. The
second alternative model (three ratios) assumed an additional, collective ω ratio for the branches leading to the
three male-biased paralogs, and the third alternative
model (five ratios) assumed a distinct ω for each branch
leading to a male-biased paralog or clade (Figure 3).
Results for the models and likelihood ratio tests are
given in Table 3. The two ratios model had a significantly
higher likelihood than the one ratio model and predicted a
higher ω for branches within the aphid slimfast expansion,
consistent with previous work [9]. Therefore, the remaining two models were compared to the two ratios model.
The three ratios model was not significantly better than
the two ratios model, but a significant improvement in

likelihood was observed with the five ratios model. Using
the five ratios model, branches leading to male-biased
clades (ACYPIslif6, contig 1492 and ACYPIslif5, contig
8321) had lower ω values than the average branch within
the expansion (0.17-0.18 vs. 0.22). In contrast, the branch
leading to ACYPIslif10 had a greater ω value than other
expansion branches (0.61 vs. 0.22).

Discussion
The nutrient amino acid transporter slimfast plays an
important role in nutritionally dependent processes, such
as coordinated growth in both males and females and
oogenesis in females. By acting as a nutrient sensor, slimfast stimulates processes like nutrient import, metabolism,
and translation in response to nutrient availability via the
Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway [21,22].
TOR signaling activation relies especially on slimfast
expression in the insect fat body, evidenced by the fact
that in Drosophila melanogaster, downregulating slimfast

The null model (one ratio) assumed equal ω across all branches.
The first alternative model (two ratios) assumed one ω ratio for
branches outside the aphid-specific slimfast expansion and a
different ω ratio for branches within the expansion. The second
alternative model (three ratios) assumed an additional, collective ω
ratio for the branches leading to the three male-biased paralogs,
and third alternative model (five ratios) assumed a distinct ω for
each branch leading to a male-biased paralog or clade.

in fat body cells disrupts overall growth [18]. In mosquitoes, slimfast expression in the fat body also activates vitellogenesis [23], a key process in oogenesis. While oogenesis
is reproductive in nature, it is fundamentally nutrient-driven because female reproductive processes, unlike male
reproductive processes, are energetically costly and depend
directly on nutrient availability [24,25]. Although a malespecific role for slimfast has never been documented in
any insect, we present evidence that some paralogs in the
aphid-specific slimfast expansion have evolved a male
functional role.
Aphids possess male-enriched nutrient amino acid
transporters, including conserved male-biased paralogs in
the aphid-specific slimfast expansion

We have identified five nutrient amino acid transporters

to at least one female aphid morph. Although the software Blast2GO failed to annotate all five of the contigs
we identified from the microarray (Table 1 and Additional file 3), InterProScan IDs and Pfam searches provided strong support that all five contigs are amino acid
transporters and that four of the five contain either the
Aa_trans or AA_permease transmembrane domains
(Table 1). These domains characterize two amino acid
transporter families, the amino acid/polyamine/organocation (APC) family (TC #2.A.3), and the amino acid/
auxin permease (AAAP) family (TC #2.A.18) [26-29].
These amino acid transporter families contain all but a
handful [30] of the known nutrient amino acid transporters. Though one contig (8321) did not significantly
match any Pfam domain (Table 1), its strongly supported phylogenetic position within the A. pisum expansion of slimfast (Figure 1), a member of the APC family,
indicates that contig 8321 is also a member of the APC
family. Of the five male-enriched nutrient amino acid
transporters (Table 1 and Additional file 3), contigs
1492 and 8321 (see Additional file 4 for GenBank accessions) are male-biased, being overexpressed in males
relative to all three female reproductive morphs.
Shifting our study focus to A. pisum supported a conserved male role for slimfast. The phylogenetic placement
of contigs 1492 and 8321 indicates that they are orthologous to A. pisum slimfast paralogs ACYPIslif6 and 5
respectively (Figure 1). Male-biased expression in these
paralogs (Figure 2) suggests that their male-biased expression is conserved minimally in the Macrosiphini tribe, of
which A. pisum and M. persicae are members. Further,

Duncan et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:253
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/253

QPCR expression analysis revealed one more male-biased
paralog, ACYPIslif10 (Figure 2). Male expression in ACYPIslif10 was low compared to the expression observed for
ACYPIslif5 and 6 (Figure 2), which may indicate that it is
expressed only in a particular tissue and its true expression
level is confounded by quantifying expression in whole
insects. Because slimfast is not known to have a malespecific role, the presence of male-biased slimfast paralogs
in aphids is puzzling. If aphid slimfast paralogs retain a
function in activating TOR signaling and nutrient-dependent processes, then the presence of male-biased paralogs
could indicate that male and female aphids must overcome different nutritional challenges.
The evolutionary origin of male-biased slimfast
expression in aphids

Given the phylogenetic distribution of male-biased expression (Figure 2), we are unable to conclusively reconstruct
when male-biased expression evolved within the slimfast
expansion. The current data set can explain the distribution of male-biased expression by two alternatives. First,
male-biased expression could be derived, which could
have happened in one of two ways. Either male-biased
expression evolved independently for each paralog, or it
evolved twice independently and was lost in the lineage
leading to ACYPIslif4. A second, equally parsimonious,
explanation is that male-biased expression is the ancestral
state and was lost three times. Derived and ancestral malebiased expression in the expansion are thus equally plausible given our data. Distinguishing between these two
explanations would be facilitated by data for the three
paralogs lacking expression information (Figure 2).
Despite the lack of resolution in our results for when
male-biased expression evolved in the slimfast expansion, support for derived male-biased expression in
aphids can be gleaned from the literature. In a study
examining sex-biased genes in seven Drosophila species,
slimfast was significantly female-biased in five species
and not significantly enriched in either sex for the other
two species (see Supplementary Tables from [31]). This
expression may reflect the ancestral state of the aphid
slimfast expansion since Drosophila genomes have only
one slimfast copy (http://phylomedb.org), and the essential role of slimfast in growth [18] strongly suggests that
Drosophila slimfast is under strong purifying selection.
Our molecular evolution analyses support strong purifying selection for Drosophila and other insect slimfast,
evidenced by the significantly lower ω found for
branches outside the aphid slimfast expansion (Table 3).
Further, the known female and sex-neutral roles [18,23]
but lack of documented male role suggests that malebiased expression (and corresponding male function) is
derived among aphids.

Evolution of a male-biased functional role in aphid
slimfast

Male-biased genes reflect traits that increase male fitness,
such as male-male competition, sexually selected characters and secondary sexual characters [32]. The male roles
of three aphid slimfast paralogs can be hypothesized from
our current and previous results. Although we did not
examine tissue-level expression in this study, our previous
work [9] quantified relative expression levels of slimfast
paralogs in asexual female head, gut and bacteriocytes.
While tissue-level expression patterns may not be identical
in both sexes, these data provide a framework within
which to formulate some of the possible testable hypotheses about the function of male-biased paralogs. In this
context, all three male-biased paralogs show highly
enriched expression in asexual female gut [9], consistent
with slimfast expression in Drosophila [18] and Tribolium
[Supporting Table 3 from [33]].
The digestive tract interfaces between an animal and its
diet, playing a critical role in uptaking dietary nutrients.
Dietary nutrient availability is central to the aphid/Buchnera nutritional symbiosis because deficient dietary
amino acids must be synthesized by Buchnera. While
Buchnera-containing bacteriocytes are abundant in
females, males contain relatively few [34] and in extreme
cases, males completely lack bacteriocytes [35,36]. This
sex-based difference in a major nutrient provisioning cell
type suggests that males and females differ in their ability
to synthesize amino acids deficient in their diet. Differential amino acid biosynthesis could be compensated for by
upregulating amino acid transporters in the male gut,
enabling greater uptake of certain amino acids from
phloem sap.
In contrast, other expression patterns we observed previously suggest an alternative possibility for male function.
In addition to being enriched in gut, two of the malebiased paralogs (ACYPIslif6 and ACYPIslif10; Figure 2)
were also enriched in the asexual female head [9]. These
paralogs could thus function in any of the head tissues
included in the analysis, such as brain, eyes, mouthparts,
antennae, or salivary glands. These tissues suggest that the
male-biased paralogs could be implicated in sensory functions, such as locating a mate.
The possibility remains that the male-biased paralogs
have evolved a different expression pattern (and function)
from asexual females. One possible role for these malebiased paralogs that we cannot predict from female
expression profiles is a role in male reproduction, such as
spermatogenesis. Although slimfast has never been implicated in spermatogenesis, related mammalian transporters (SLC7A1 and SLC7A2) deliver L-Arginine to rat
seminiferous tubule cells [37], where spermatogeneis
begins. Thus, divergence of some slimfast paralogs to fill

Duncan et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:253
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/253

a male reproductive role is plausible. In light of the molecular evolution results, paralog ACYPIslif10 is the best
candidate for having a role in spermatogenesis since its
terminal branch has experienced an extremely accelerated rate of non-synonymous substitutions (Table 3).
Accelerated evolutionary rates are commonly associated
with male-biased genes, especially genes involved in
sperm competition [32]. While the accelerated ω we
observed is consistent with both positive and neutral/
relaxed selection, both types of selection can lead to
functional divergence [38,39]. Additional studies can
tease apart the various hypotheses we have presented for
the role played by male-biased slimfast paralogs in aphid
biology.
Insights on the maintenance of duplicate amino acid
transporters in aphids

By pointing towards a derived evolutionary origin of malebiased function in slimfast, our results provide insights into
a fundamental question of how the aphid genome retains
the slimfast expansion and other nutrient amino acid
transporter duplications [see also 9]. Given that most gene
duplications fail to reach fixation [1], it is intriguing that
the aphid genome possesses more nutrient amino acid
transporters than other sequenced insects [9]. The presence of these duplicate amino acid transporters indicates
that there must be a selective advantage to their maintenance. As mentioned above, we previously discovered that
some duplicate nutrient amino acid transporters (including
some slimfast paralogs) are highly enriched in bacteriocytes, leading us to hypothesize that these transporters
mediate nutrient exchange across the A. pisum/Buchnera
symbiotic interface [9]. A role in mediating endosymbiotic
interactions strongly suggests that duplicate nutrient
amino acid transporters and the slimfast expansion are
maintained in the genome because they diverged to fill a
novel role in symbiosis. The current study supports a different, but not mutually exclusive, hypothesis that the slimfast expansion (and possibly other nutrient amino acid
transporter duplicates) is maintained because some paralogs diverged to fill novel, sex-specific roles. Future studies
will be able to test the relative significance of symbiosis
and sex in maintaining amino acid transporter gene duplications by examining the genetic architecture and expression of nutrient amino acid transporters in other phloemfeeding insects with different, less complex life cycles.

Conclusions
This study is the first to report evidence for a male function of the nutrient amino acid transporter slimfast. Using
a microarray and QPCR, we identified three male-biased
slimfast paralogs in an aphid-specific gene family expansion, and two of those paralogs had conserved expression
profiles across two aphid species. By integrating different

Page 8 of 12

sources of knowledge on the function and expression of
slimfast and related nutrient amino acid transporters, we
propose competing hypotheses for the function of malebiased slimfast in male-dependent nutritional, sensory,
and reproductive functions.
This study highlights the necessity of examining different types of expression data for functionally annotating
genes in novel genomes. While our previous work
showed evidence that the aphid slimfast expansion is
maintained in the A. pisum genome because some paralogs evolved a novel role in mediating symbiotic interactions [9], this study extends the hypothesis for the
maintenance of the slimfast expansion to include paralog divergence for unexpected sex-dependent functions.
The integration of different expression profiles to assist
in functionally characterizing genes is particularly
important for novel genes in all organisms, including
gene duplications, which have the potential to evolve
divergent functions from homologous genes present in
single copies in other organisms.

Methods
Design, execution, and statistical analysis of microarray
experiments

To investigate gene expression based on sex, Agilent
microarrays targeting 10,478 M. persicae unigenes [40]
and ESTs were used to quantify mRNA expression. The
microarray measured gene expression between four treatments and two aphid lines (W109 and W115), both collected in 2008 on tobacco in Windsor, CT by ACCW and
colleague. The four treatments were males and three different female reproductive morphs: sexual females, asexual
females at short day, and asexual females at long day. We
collected asexual females at long day from our standard
asexual cultures (14:10 Light:Dark, 20°C). To induce sexual
morphs, we simulated seasonal differences by changing the
growth temperature and light/dark cycle (10:14 L:D, 16°C).
When sexual morphs appeared, males, sexual females and
asexual females at short day were collected.
Total RNA was extracted from ten flash frozen aphids
per aphid line per treatment using an RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA quantity and quality was
assessed using an RNA 6000 Chip on the Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer. One microgram of total RNA was labeled
using an Amino Allyl MessageAmp aRNA Amplification
Kit (Ambion) and Cy3- and Cy5-NHS ethers (Amersham).
Following labeling, the concentration of each sample was
determined spectrophotometrically and equal amounts of
labeled amplified RNA were competitively hybridized to
the arrays. Factorial design was used for this microarray
experiment. Four competitive hybridizations using the
aphid line W109 (first biological replicate) were made as
following: male ® asexual female (long day) ® sexual
female ® asexual female (short day) ® male. The

direction of the arrow indicates Cy3 ® Cy5 sample labeling. An additional four competitive hybridizations were
made with the reverse labeling (Cy5 ® Cy3) using the
aphid line W115 (second biological replicate).
Following hybridization and washing, microarrays were
scanned at 5 μm resolution using a GenePix 4000B scanner (Molecular Devices). The resulting images were analyzed using GenePix Pro 6.1 (Molecular Devices) and
subject to quality control using Acuity 4.0 (Molecular
Devices). Data were analyzed using Linear Models for
Microarray Data (LIMMA) implemented in R [41]. Data
normalization was executed first within each array using
loess normalization, then normalization between arrays
was executed using the LIMMA quantile algorithm. Differential expression and false discovery rates (FDR) were
assessed using a linear model and empirical Bayes moderated F statistics [42,43]. All primary microarray data are
accessible through the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
database (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/geo) under the GEO
series accession number GSE31024.
Annotating sex-enriched genes

Sex-enriched genes identified in the microarray were
annotated in Blast2GO v. 12.7.0 [44]. Blast2GO implements a BLAST search and maps Gene Ontology (GO)
annotations to the query sequences based on the best
BLAST hits. Next, the annotation step evaluates candidate
GO terms based on their hit similarity and annotation evidence codes (e.g. experimentally validated, computationally
validated, etc.) to assign the most specific GO annotations
possible to the original query sequences. The Blast2GO
platform can also be used to perform an InterProScan to
annotate sequences based on protein domain and motif
signatures. GO terms corresponding to the InterPro annotation are then merged with the GO annotations assigned
by the annotation step.
Sex-enriched M. persicae sequences were input as the
query sequences and compared to the NCBI protein
sequence database using a TBLASTN search, keeping up
to 50 top hits at an e-value of 0.001 or less. Annotation
was performed in two rounds to maximize both the quality and number of annotations. First, the annotation step
was run with default evidence code weights, except that
the evidence code IEA (Inferred from Electronic Annotation) was weighted 0. For the second round, unannotated
sequences were passed through the annotation step using
default evidence code weights. After the annotation step,
we ran the InterProScan and merged the InterPro results
with the previous annotations. Annotations were then
augmented using Annex, a database of manually reviewed
relationships between the three GO categories [45].
Finally, the GO-slim function was used to summarize the
annotation results. A fisher exact test was implemented in

Page 9 of 12

Blast2GO to examine overrepresented GO terms in maleenriched and female-enriched genes. Significance was
assessed by a FDR of 0.05 or less.
Identification and annotation of male-enriched amino
acid transporters

Male-enriched amino acid transporters were annotated
based on GO terms and InterProScan IDs from a list of
sex-biased genes found in the microarray. Annotations
were manually validated by searching for protein domains
in Pfam by hidden markov models (http://pfam.sanger.ac.
uk/). Two male-biased amino acid transporters were
assigned orthology to genes in the pea aphid, A. pisum, by
reciprocal BLAST and phylogenetic analysis. Briefly, the
M. persicae sequences were queried against the A. pisum
non-redundant (nr) protein database on NCBI using a
BLASTX search. Query sequences were contigs assembled
from M. persicae ESTs [40] (available at http://www.aphidbase.com/aphidbase/downloads). The top A. pisum
BLAST hit for each query was subsequently subjected to a
local TBLASTN search against the entire set of M. persicae unigenes in the microarray.
For the phylogenetic analysis, male-biased M. persicae
contigs were translated to protein and aligned to a profile
of A. pisum homologs in SeaView v. 4 [46] using a Clustal
W [47] plug-in. The profile, from Price et al., [9], consisted
of all A. pisum members of the slimfast gene family, slimfast sequences from select other insects, and two outgroup
sequences closely related to the slimfast gene family [9].
The new alignment was then used to build a phylogeny in
MrBayes v. 3.1.2 [48] using two simultaneous runs, each
with four chains. Chains were run for two million generations, after which the standard deviation of split frequencies between the runs was less than 0.01. Convergence was
assessed in Tracer v. 1.5 [49]. Briefly, Tracer plots the
value of the log-likelihood and model parameters against
the number of generations, visually displaying parameter
convergence between the two runs and enabling us to
determine that MrBayes sufficiently sampled the parameter space. A consensus tree was constructed after discarding generations making up the burn-in, as determined
in Tracer v. 1.5 [49].
Analyzing sex-biased gene expression of slimfast
homologs in A. pisum

Sex-dependent expression for seven out of ten A. pisum
slimfast homologs was quantified by performing QPCR on
three different A. pisum clonal lineages that included two
lineages with intermediate lifecycles, LSR1 [50] and 7A
[51] and one holocyclic lineage, 9-2-1 [52] (see [53] for a
description of the morphs produced by different aphid life
cycle classes). The three paralogs for which we did not
quantify expression shared so much sequence similarity
and untranslated regions were so AT rich (~80%) that we

Duncan et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:253
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/253

were unable to design paralog-specific primers. For the
two intermediate lineages (LSR1 and 7A), QPCR was performed on the same aphid morphs used in the microarray,
asexual females at long day, asexual females at short day,
sexual females, and males. For the holocyclic lineage (9-21), which completely switches to the production of sexual
morphs at short day, QPCR was performed on asexual
females at long day, sexual females, and males. Males and
female morphs were collected as described above.
Total RNA was extracted from at least 6 whole, wingless
adults of each morph using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen),
and a DNase digest was performed to eliminate genomic
DNA. cDNA was synthesized from 450 ng of total RNA
using qScript cDNA SuperMix (Quanta Biosciences) and
QPCR was performed using PerfeCTa® SYBR® Green FastMix® (Quanta Biosciences). Gene expression was compared between morphs using 2-ΔΔCT methodology [54],
with expression between morphs normalized to the expression of housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-dehydrogenase
(GAPDH, ACYPI009769 [8]). Experiments were each performed in triplicate and included no template controls.
Prior to running experiments, we verified that cDNA pools
lacked genomic DNA by running no reverse transcription
controls alongside no template controls and positive controls. QPCR reactions were performed on a Mastercycler®
ep realplex4 real-time PCR system (Eppendorf) using a program that began with 95°C for 5 minutes, followed by 40
cycles at 95°C for 15 sec, 52°C for 15 sec, and 60°C for 20
sec. Amplification profiles and melt-curves were analyzed
in Mastercycler® ep realplex software v. 1.5 (Eppendorf).
For information on primer sequences and efficiencies, see
[9]. Gene expression data were collectively normalized,
allowing comparison of expression profiles across paralogs
and aphid lines. Normalization was performed by converting ΔCT values to z-scores as follows:
z = −10 ×

CT − CT
σ CT

The normalized expression for each gene from the
three lines was compiled into a heat map where yellow
indicates z > 0 and blue indicates z < 0.
Molecular evolution analyses

Rates of molecular evolution along phylogenetic tree
branches were estimated for branches in the aphid specific slimfast expansion. The analysis was conducted using
the same phylogeneny for which the methods were
described above. The amino acid alignment used to
reconstruct the tree was converted back to a codon alignment in SeaView v. 4 [46], and the codon alignment was
used to estimate the ratio of non-synonymous (dN) to
synonymous (dS) substitution rates along branches, or
dN/dS (also denoted ω). The ω ratio reflects the strength

Page 10 of 12

and type of selection in protein coding sequences. Excess
dS (ω < 1) indicates that selection favors substitutions
that conserve the amino acid sequence (purifying selection), while equal dS and dN (ω = 1) illustrates relaxed
selective constraints (neutral selection). Excess dN (ω >
1) indicates that selection favors substitutions that
change the amino acid sequence (positive selection).
The ω ratio was estimated for different branches in
the aphid slimfast expansion by maximum likelihood in
the PAML package [55]. Analyses implemented the
branch models [19,20] with one or more ω categories
for branches and one ω across sites (model = 0 or 2,
NSsites = 0). The parameters ω and  (transition rate/
transversion rate) were both estimated, starting from
initial values of 0.2 and 2 respectively, and codon frequency was measured using a 3 × 4 codon table. We
tested for elevated ω along specific branches using various models. Briefly, we tested the null model assuming
equal ω across branches and several nested models
allowing for different ω ratios for particular groups of
branches and compared the log likelihoods under these
models with a likelihood ratio test [LRT, [19]]. If the
LRT showed a statistically significant improvement in
log likelihood from one model to the next, then the
model with the higher log likelihood was supported.
Models we tested were inspired by the expression profiles of aphid paralogs in the expansion and we outline
them in the results section.
