Polymorphism, selection and tandem duplication
of transferrin genes in Atlantic cod (Gadus
morhua) - Conserved synteny between fish
monolobal and tetrapod bilobal transferrin loci

Abstract
Background: The two homologous iron-binding lobes of transferrins are thought to have evolved by gene
duplication of an ancestral monolobal form, but any conserved synteny between bilobal and monolobal transferrin
loci remains unexplored. The important role played by transferrin in the resistance to invading pathogens makes
this polymorphic gene a highly valuable candidate for studying adaptive divergence among local populations.
Results: The Atlantic cod genome was shown to harbour two tandem duplicated serum transferrin genes (Tf1, Tf2),
a melanotransferrin gene (MTf), and a monolobal transferrin gene (Omp). Whereas Tf1 and Tf2 were differentially
expressed in liver and brain, the Omp transcript was restricted to the otoliths. Fish, chicken and mammals showed
highly conserved syntenic regions in which monolobal and bilobal transferrins reside, but contrasting with
tetrapods, the fish transferrin genes are positioned on three different linkage groups. Sequence alignment of cod
Tf1 cDNAs from Northeast (NE) and Northwest (NW) Atlantic populations revealed 22 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNP) causing the replacement of 16 amino acids, including eight surface residues revealed by the
modelled 3D-structures, that might influence the binding of pathogens for removal of iron. SNP analysis of a total
of 375 individuals from 14 trans-Atlantic populations showed that the Tf1-NE variant was almost fixed in the Baltic
cod and predominated in the other NE Atlantic populations, whereas the NW Atlantic populations were more
heterozygous and showed high frequencies of the Tf-NW SNP alleles.
Conclusions: The highly conserved synteny between fish and tetrapod transferrin loci infers that the fusion of tandem
duplicated Omp-like genes gave rise to the modern transferrins. The multiple nonsynonymous substitutions in cod Tf1
with putative structural effects, together with highly divergent allele frequencies among different cod populations,
strongly suggest evidence for positive selection and local adaptation in trans-Atlantic cod populations.

Background
There is an increasing interest in studying genotype by
environment interactions in terrestrial and aquatic
organisms to clarify how different populations might
have diverged to become adapted to local habitats, and
to understand how populations may respond to human* Correspondence: oivind.andersen@nofima.no

induced selection. In marine fishes the population structure is expected to be weak because of extensive gene
flow, and it might be questioned whether adaptive
responses to changes in physico-chemical conditions or
selective harvesting have occurred in this large vertebrate group. These objections have been challenged by
an increasing number of genetic studies of population
structure [1-3]. The focus has recently changed from
the rather descriptive population genetic analyses to an

intensive search for functional genes subjected to natural selection [4,5]. The limited number of fitnessrelated genes reported to be associated with adaptive
traits in marine or euryhaline fishes includes the threespined stickleback ectodysplasin [6], European flounder
Hsc70 [7], killifish lactate dehydrogenase [8], and Atlantic cod pantophysin [9,10] and hemoglobin [11]. The
latter study provided evidence for local adaptation in
cod populations by identifying molecular mechanisms
underlying the different oxygen binding properties of
the cod hemoglobins in temperate and Arctic waters.
An alternative strategy for identifying adaptive population divergence is to scan transcriptome databases, or
the whole genome when available, for polymorphic loci
to be analysed in different populations [5]. Evidence of
directional selection in Atlantic cod was provided by
genotyping multiple gene-associated single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in Northeast and Northwest
Atlantic populations [12-14]. Outlier loci were shown to
be correlated with temperatures and/or salinity conditions that might be associated with local adaptation.
However, documentation of molecular changes underlying adaptive traits requires additional information about
the specific genes involved and the regulatory or structural implications of the identified mutations.
Iron is an essential element required for the growth
and survival of most organisms, and the iron balance is
therefore tightly regulated by several interacting ironbinding factors [15]. Serum transferrin plays a crucial
role in iron metabolism as it provides most of the iron
required for organismal functions [16]. The two homologous iron-binding lobes of modern transferrins are
believed to have evolved by gene duplication of a primitive monolobal form [17,18], which has been reported in
a surprisingly few species. Most insect transferrins bind
only one ferric iron, but this is because of extensive
deletions in the C-terminal lobe [19]. Evidence of a 44kDa hagfish transferrin with only one iron-binding site
was contradicted in a later study [20], and a report on
monolobal rat hemiferrin turned out to be erroneous
[21]. True monolobal transferrin has therefore been
claimed to be present only in ascidian species of the
Urochordates [22-24]. A transferrin-like otolith matrix
protein (OMP) with a single potential metal binding site
was identified in rainbow trout and zebrafish [25-27],
but the protein was proposed to represent a partial
sequence of the membrane-bound melanotransferrin
(MTf) [28]. The possibility for an alternatively spliced
monolobal variant of the MTf gene might be excluded
by the identification of both genes in the fish genome.
By limiting the availability of iron for replicating
pathogens transferrin provides resistance to bacterial
infections [29,30], but an iron-independent role of transferrin in the immune system is evidenced by the

involvement of transferrin and its receptor in early T
cell differentiation in the thymus [31]. The conserved
dual functions of transferrin in the iron metabolism and
immune response were recently demonstrated in sea
bass, which responded to both bacterial infection and
altered iron status by modulating the liver and brain
expression of transferrin [32]. Bacterial species have a
variety of mechanisms for obtaining transferrin-bound
iron [33], and competition for iron from bacterial pathogens could potentially be a strong source of natural
selection on vertebrate transferrins. For example, Newton et al. [34] provided evidence for a transferrin allele
as a host-level risk factor in naturally occurring equine
respiratory disease, and Jurecka et al. [35] showed that
particular transferrin alleles were associated with the
resistance of common carp to the blood parasite Trypanoplasma borrelli probably as a direct effect of binding
to the transferrin receptor of the parasite.
Atlantic cod has been one of the major fish resources
on the continental shelf and banks on both sides of the
North Atlantic Ocean, and has undergone a complex
pattern of phylogenetic evolution, including population
fluctuations attributable to long-term geological events,
short-term ecological history and contemporary antropogenic fishing and environmental shifts [36,37]. Serum
transferrin polymorphism in Atlantic cod was reported
almost 50 years ago [38], and the presence of two distinct cod populations at the Faroe Islands was proposed
by analysing the frequencies of five transferrin types
[39]. The important role played by transferrin in the
immune response makes this polymorphic gene highly
valuable for identifying adaptive divergence between
local populations. Here we report on selective signatures
of a tandem duplicated transferrin gene in trans-Atlantic
populations, and provide novel evidence for the evolution of modern transferrins from a monolobal transferrin locus.

Results
Four cod transferrin genes

Two full-length Atlantic cod Tf cDNAs with different
3’UTR length were identified in the GAFFA database of
the Norwegian coastal cod population. The open reading frame (ORF) of 2073 nucleotides (nt) was identical
in the two cDNAs, and the 689 amino acids (aa) of the
designated cod Tf1 were predicted (Figure 1). The corresponding Tf1 gene spanned about 8 kb of scaffold
GmG100427sc4451 in the reference genome of Atlantic
cod representing the Northeast Arctic population (Figure 2). Aligning the Tf1 genomic and cDNA sequences
revealed 17 exons sharing 100% sequence identity with
the Tf1 cDNA. The allelic variant of cod Tf1 identified
in the two Northeast Atlantic populations was named
Tf1-NE.

A second transferrin gene designated cod Tf2 was
found about 16.5 kb downstream of Tf1 (Figure 2). The
17 exons of Tf2 were identified by aligning the tandem
duplicated Tf genes, and the predicted 683 aa of Tf2
shared 84% identity with cod Tf1 (Figure 1). The two
serum transferrins showed 82 and 78% identity, respectively, with haddock Tf, but only 53-63% identity with
the non-gadoid fish Tfs presented in the constructed
phylogenetic tree (Figure 3). Although the gadoids clustered with the Antarctic notothenioids examined, the
phylogenetic tree seems to be consistent with the taxonomic classification of teleosts, while man and Ciona
formed separate branches. Four potential iron-binding
residues forming a DYYH motif [40] are conserved in
both the N- and C-lobe of cod Tf1 and Tf2, and the
two lobes contained 12 and 14 conserved Cys residues,
respectively, involved in the formation of disulphide

Page 4 of 14

bridges (Figure 1). However, the basic Arg residue serving as the principal anchor for the synergistic carbonate anion has been changed to Lys131 in the N-lobe of
Tf1 and to Thr455 in the C-lobe of Tf2. The corresponding Arg124Lys mutation in the N-lobal anion
binding site of human Tf generated a protein much
more facile in releasing iron [41]. The 3D structure of
Tf1 and Tf2 illustrates the bilobal nature of the proteins
in which each lobe is divided into two subdomains connected by a hinge that give rise to a deep cleft containing the iron-binding residues (Figure 4A, B). The
expression of the two genes was semi-quantified by RTPCR using gene specific primers. The transcripts of both
Tf1 and Tf2 were identified in the liver and brain, but
Tf2 was expressed at very low levels compared to Tf1
(Figure 5A). Reducing the number of PCR cycles from
35 to 25 diminished the Tf1 amplicon considerably only

in the brain, indicating abundant expression of Tf1 in
the liver.
A cod melanotransferrin (MTf) gene and its cDNA
were identified in scaffold GmG100427s526 of the reference genome (Figure 2) and in the GAFFA database,
respectively. Sequence alignment revealed 17 exons, and
the ORF of 2166 nt encodes the predicted 722 aa of cod
MTf, which showed only 36% identity with cod Tf1 and
Tf2 (Figure 1). In comparison, cod MTf shared 62-69%
identity with the MTf of stickleback, medaka, pufferfish
and zebrafish. The cluster of fish and human MTf in
the phylogenetic tree was, however, not supported by
the low boot strap value (<50%), and Ciona Tf formed a
separate branch (Figure 3). All four iron-binding residues (Asp393, Tyr423, Tyr527, His596) are present in
the C-lobe of cod MTf, whereas Tyr56 and Arg257 in
the N-lobe have replaced the crucial Asp and His residues, respectively (Figure 4C). Thus, the iron-binding
activity is apparently intact only in the C-lobe of cod
MTf, in contrast to the binding of iron to the N-lobe of
mammalian MTf, in which the C-lobe is involved in
membrane anchoring [42]. Although the residues for

iron binding are not conserved in MTf, the overall
sequence identity between the two lobes in MTf is
higher than those of Tf in both man (48% and 42%,
respectively) and cod (42% and 36%; Tf1, 38%; Tf2).
Consistently, the N- and C-lobes of cod MTf aligned
closely in the superimposition of the two lobes (Figure
4C), and a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.5 Å
over 264 aligned C-a atoms was calculated.
A monolobal transferrin of only 370 aa was predicted
from the 9 exons identified in a gene spanning the
entire scaffold GmG100427s1898 of 37.8 kb in the reference cod genome (Figure 1 and 2). The completeness of
the gene was confirmed by the identification of the
orthologous gene and the conserved flanking genes
Senp2, Tra2b, D2hgdh and Slitrk3 in the other fish genomes available, including medaka and stickleback (Figure 2). Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed the
exclusive staining of the otoliths in the cod larvae (Figure 5B), and the predicted protein showed 79 and 76%
identity, respectively, with the otolith matrix protein
(OMP) of rainbow trout and zebrafish [25,27]. Cod
OMP shared low identity with the N- and C-lobes,

respectively, of Tf1 (32% and 31%), Tf2 (34% and 32%)
and MTf (38% and 35%), which are slightly higher than
the identities of 31 and 30% between the monolobal
nicaTf and the N- and C- lobes, respectively, of Tf in
Ciona intestinalis [43]. The monolobal nature of cod
OMP was illustrated by the 3D model of the protein
superimposed on the C-lobe of cod MTf (Figure 4D).
The C-a RMSD of 1.52 and 0.60 Å, respectively,
between OMP and the N- and C-lobes of MTf (over
271 and 315 aligned C-a atoms, respectively) indicates a
major structural similarity of OMP to the C-lobe,
although cod OMP is lacking all the key residues for
iron and carbonate anion binding, except for the conserved Tyr111 (Figure 1).

Cod Tf1 polymorphisms

Polymorphisms in the cod Tf1 were found by comparing
the Tf1-NE variant with a Tf cDNA isolated from a
Northwest (NW) Atlantic cod population [44]. The
missing N-terminal coding sequence of the latter variant
named Tf1-NW was PCR amplified from a heterozygous
Faroe cod, and a total of 22 SNPs were identified by
aligning the protein coding sequences of the two cod
Tf1 variants (Additional file 1; Figure S1). The 18 nonsynonymous substitution sites were found to cause 16
amino acid replacements, including eight surface residues (Figure 4E). Additionally, E160 is deleted in the
NW variant probably as the result of alternative splicing
of exons 5 and 6. The 3D model of the NE and NW
variants revealed no structural differences in the ironbinding sites, and the high structural similarity between
the two variants was expressed by the calculated RMSD
of only 0.64Å between Ca atoms. The dN/dS ratio of 5.8
between the NW and NE variants is significantly greater

than 1 (p = 0.0013) indicating strong positive selection
on the cod Tf1 gene.
Population genetic analyses

The cod Tf1 polymorphisms were investigated in 14
cod populations covering the North Atlantic (Table 1,
Additional file 2; Figure S2) by genotyping six of the
22 identified SNPs. The NE haplotype was almost fixed
in the Baltic cod samples and predominated in the
other eastern Atlantic samples, although at slightly different frequencies in the Northeast Arctic cod and the
Greenland Nuuk sample (Figure 6, Additional file 3:
Table S1). In contrast, the NW alleles of the three
SNPs tf-8, tf-10 and tf-11 dominated in the Canadian
samples examined, whereas alleles of the N-terminal
(tf-6) and the C-terminal SNPs (tf-13, tf-22) were in
similar proportions among all west Atlantic samples,
including the Greenland Sisimiut cod. Population pairwise FST values based on all six SNP loci demonstrated
a clear genetic separation between eastern and western
cod samples, with intermediate Northeast Arctic
(Båtsfjord) and Greenland cod (Figure 7; Additional
file 4: Table S2). Heterozygosity showed an increasing
trend from almost zero in the Baltic to close to 50% in
western Atlantic samples (Table 1, Additional file 3:
Table S1).

Discussion
The identification of four transferrin genes in the Atlantic cod genome adds novel information to our knowledge about the evolution of the transferrin gene family
by documenting 1) the expression of tandem duplicated
transferrin genes, 2) presence of both bilobal and monolobal transferrin forms in the fish genome, 3) highly
conserved synteny between fish monolobal and tetrapod
bilobal transferrin loci, and 4) evidence of positive selection acting on a tandem duplicated transferrin gene in
trans-Atlantic cod populations. The close linkage of the
Tf1 and Tf2 genes in the cod genome confirms the suggested tandem duplication of transferrin genes in salmonids and channel catfish based on Southern blotting,
pedigree and RFLP analyses [45-48]. The higher
sequence identity between the Tf genes in salmonids
(96%) than in cod (84%) indicates separate events of tandem gene duplication of this iron-binding protein, and
are supported by the separate TF1/Tf2 bifurcations in
salmonids, cod and flounder in the phylogenetic tree.
The evolution of bilobal transferrins from an ancestral
monolobal form is thought to have occurred in the last
common ancestor of vertebrates and arthropods at least
600 MYA [28,49-51]. However, Williams et al. [52] proposed that the gene duplication event occurred in the
prochordates about 500 MYA and correlated with the

Figure 6 Allele frequencies of six SNP loci spanning the Tf1 gene in cod samples collected across the North Atlantic. See Table 1 and
Additional file 2; Figure S2 for sampling locations, and Additional file 3: Table S1 for SNP alleles.

evolution of a filtration kidney in higher vertebrates that
would cause the excretion of monolobal transferrins of
about 40 kDa. Tinoco et al. [24] argued that the major
advantage for the evolution of bilobal transferrins is the
stronger iron affinity because of cooperativity, while
monolobal transferrins may have evolved as more general metal ion transporters such as the proposed role of
ascidian nicaTf in vanadium trafficking using carbonate
as synergistic anion [53]. Contrasting with nicaTf, the
iron-binding residues are not conserved in the fish
OMP, which seems to be involved in the otolith formation by providing calcium carbonate [25]. The otoliths
grow by the continuous deposition of calcium carbonate,
and knockdown of zebrafish Omp caused a reduction in
otolith size [27]. Thus, this monolobal fish transferrin
form has apparently acquired a novel function within
the otoliths without being excreted by the kidney.
The evolution of modern transferrins might be elucidated by searching for conserved synteny between
monolobal and bilobal transferrin genes. Similar to the
linkage of the different transferrin genes in mammals
and chicken [54], the Ciona nicaTf and Tf-like genes are
both located on chromosome 7q [43], but we were not
able to find any syntenic segments between these linkage groups. In contrast, the fish Tf, MTf and Omp genes

are positioned on three linkage groups, and the Omp
flanking genes Senp2, Tra2b and D2hgdh are closely
linked to chicken Tf on chromosome 9, while Senp2,
Tra2b and Slitrk3 are flanked by human MTF and Tf on
chromosome 3 (Figure 2). The conserved synteny
between fish monolobal and tetrapod bilobal transferrin
loci infers close evolutionary relationship, and we propose that an Omp-like gene became duplicated and gave
rise to a bilobal form in the common ancestor of the
fish and tetrapod lineages. The presence of a single
Omp gene and the chromosomal separation of the different transferrin genes in the extant fish genome could
be explained by two whole genome duplication events,
which are believed to have occurred in the ancestral vertebrate [55]. Our speculative model implies that the
melanotransferrin and the other transferrins did not
evolve from a common bilobal protein, but originated
from at least two distinct single gene duplication and
fusion events. This is supported by the much higher
similarity between the N- and C-lobes of melanotransferrin compared to serum transferrin, although the difference might also be explained by their different
functions [56].
The success of competition for the transferrin-bound
iron by pathogens depends on the shape and surface

charge of the transferrin molecule [57]. Selection for new
replacement alleles has been proposed to play a large role
in the evolution of transferrin within salmonids, carp and
notothenioids [35,58-60]. We show here that positive
selection on the Tf1 gene in Atlantic cod is significant as
evidenced from the high d N /d S ratio between western
and eastern Atlantic cod sequences, and suggest that the
replacement of surface residues might affect the binding
of pathogen transferrin receptors. Another way to test for
positive selection is to compare patterns of genetic divergence among populations for the transferrin SNPs with
the population structure in neutral genetic markers. Two
microsatellite datasets [61,62] and one dataset based on
88 putatively neutral SNPs [13] cover most of the transect from the Baltic along the Norwegian coast across to
Greenland, Canada and USA. These neutral markers
show several times less divergence compared to the
transferrin SNPs (Figure 7). Although one should be cautious when comparing genetic markers with different
mutational properties such as microsatellites and SNPs,
this large difference would suggest positive selection on
the transferrin gene, rather than divergence due to geographic isolation. Atlantic cod has been shown in previous studies to be subject to positive selection on several
genetic loci in relation to different environmental factors
on both local and global scales. Most notable are the
observed clines in PanI and hemoglobin in relation to
water temperature [9,11,63,64]. Baltic cod is highly divergent in the hemoglobin [65] and heat shock protein
HSP90 genes [13] compared to other populations, and
show specific adaptations such as egg buoyancy and
sperm motility to the low salinity environment [66]. Intriguingly, additional biological functions of transferrin
were suggested by the relation of the carp transferrin
polymorphism to sperm motility characteristics [67], and
the transferrin polymorphism in tilapia was proposed to
be associated with saltwater tolerance [68]. However,
transferrin does not seem to be under a particular selection pressure in the Baltic cod population, since SNP
allele frequencies in Baltic samples were similar to those
collected in the Kattegat, Skagerrak and North Sea.
In a recent large scale population genomic study of
1641 SNP loci, Bradbury et al. [14] demonstrated temperature-associated clines in SNP allele frequencies on

both sides of the Atlantic, suggesting selection on multiple independent genes in response to ocean temperature. This large-scale study also showed a clear pattern
of reduced heterozygosity in eastern cod populations
[14]. Whereas a similar cline in heterozygosity across
the Atlantic was shown in the present tranferrin study,
Nielsen et al. [13] did not find such a pattern for 88
neutral SNP loci. The contrasting patterns of heterozygosity may be due to ascertainment bias, since the SNP
loci showing reduced heterozygosity in the eastern
Atlantic were developed from Canadian cod [14],
whereas the SNPs in Nielsen et al. [13] were developed
from Norwegian cod in the east Atlantic. In the present
study, the transferrin SNPs were identified by comparing
cDNA sequences from Canadian and Norwegian cod
specimen, thus excluding ascertainment bias due to different population histories. Instead the difference in heterozygosity between eastern and western Atlantic cod is
most likely due to selection. The issue whether selection
has acted on the NE or NW cod populations or both
might be addressed by comparing the different gadoid
Tf sequences. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the
Tf1-NE variant had higher similarity than the NW variant to the closest outgroups haddock Tf and cod Tf2.
Comparison of the 16 aa changing sites in the cod Tf1
shows that the NE variant is identical to haddock Tf in
8 sites, while only 3 sites in the NW variant are identical
to haddock Tf (Table 2). In addition, the NE variant of
Tf1 is identical to Tf2 at 12 sites, whereas the NW variant and Tf2 are identical at only one site of the 16 substitutions. Thus, the most parsimonious explanation is
that the NE variant is ancestral to the NW variant of
cod Tf1, and that cod in the NW populations has
undergone adaptive evolution. If environmental conditions vary temporally, multiple alleles may be selected
for, increasing heterozygosity, as has been suggested for
immune resistance genes [69,70]. We have not investigated polymorphism in cod Tf2 in the different populations, which might further elucidate the origin and
divergence of this iron-binding protein.
Could historical factors have shaped the cod Tf1 SNP
allele frequencies? Paleoecological modelling, as well as
nuclear and mitochondrial genetic markers, suggests that
cod populations have survived as least for 100 000 years

on both sides of the Atlantic [36,37]. Cod populations
were more fragmented in the western Atlantic during the
last glacial maximum 20 KYA [36], and due to drift and
bottlenecks different alleles may have increased in frequency in more or less isolated NW populations. However, the higher substitution rate in nonsynonymous sites,
and the fact that multiple alleles are present also in the NE
populations, though in low frequencies, argues against the
idea that historical expansion in the NW populations
alone could explain the observed genetic pattern. Other
genetic data suggest that the Greenland populations of
Atlantic cod post-dates the last glacial period [36], which
possibly could help explain the observed intermediate
allele frequencies in Greenland samples.

Conclusion
The fish transferrin genes provide novel evidence for the
evolution of modern transferrins from monolobal transferrins by documenting highly conserved synteny
between fish and tetrapods. We propose that the evolution of the iron-binding and iron-independent functions
of the different transferrin family members probably
involved more than a single event of gene duplication
and fusion of monolobal transferrins. Although the specific forces driving evolution of the cod Tf1 are uncertain,
the multiple surface residue changes suggest an evolutionary competition for transferrin-bound iron between
the host and invading pathogens. We did not find any
difference in transferrin allele frequency between the two
Faroe populations as previously suggested [39], and also
recently based on microsatellites [61]. Neither was the
distinctness of Baltic cod previously demonstrated for
both neutral markers and coding genes, eg. hemoglobin,
supported by the transferrin polymorphisms. Our results
underline that functional genetic differences should not
be overlooked in fisheries management, but also that
markers under selection may give a completely different
view of stock structure compared to neutral markers.
Methods
Identification of cod transferrin genes and alleles

The genomic sequences of Atlantic cod Tf1, Tf2, MTf
and Omp were found by BLAST search of the reference
genome representing the Northeast Arctic population
(http://www.codgenome.no), and the cDNAs were identified by screening the GAFFA database of the Norwegian coastal cod population. The designated NE variant
of cod Tf1 differed at multiple positions from a published cod Tf sequence [44]. This was verified by PCR
using templates of liver cDNA and genomic DNA from
three Faroe cod specimen, including one heterozygous
fish possessing both variants. Primer sequences are
available upon request. The liver samples were stored in
RNA later (Ambion) before extraction of genomic DNA

Page 10 of 14

(Qiagen) and total RNA using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies). Liver cDNA was synthesized
from 1 μg total RNA using the SMART RACE cDNA
amplification kit (Clontech Laboratories Inc.) after
DNAse treatment (TURBO DNA-free kit, Ambion). The
PCR reactions were cycled in a standard thermocycler
using the Advantage 2 PCR Enzyme system (Clontech)
at standard conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The PCR products were sequenced in both directions with Big Dye sequencing kit (v.3.1) on 3730 ABI
DNA Analyser (Applied Biosystems).
Gene expression analyses
RT-PCR

Tissue expression of Tf1 and Tf2 was semi-quantified by
reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using liver and brain
from two adult Atlantic cod from the Northeast Arctic
population. PCR was run for 35 or 25 cycles with gene
specific primers (Additional file 5: Table S3) on liver
and brain cDNA templates synthesized as described
above.
Whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH)

WISH analysis of Omp expression in cod larvae was carried out as described [71]. A 906-bp region of cod Omp
was PCR amplified using gene specific primers (Additional file 5: Table S3), and sense- and antisense probes,
respectively, were synthesized from Sp6- and T7-tailed
PCR product and labelled with digoxigenin (Roche,
Basel, Switzerland). Twenty newly hatched larvae were
fixed for WISH analysis.
Generation of 3D protein structures

All computational experiments were conducted on a
Hewlett-Packard xw8600 workstation running Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 5. Sequence analysis was performed
using BLAST [72] through the Protein Data Bank (BLOSUM62 matrix). Human serum transferrin (Protein Data
Bank ID 2HAU) [73] was selected as the most appropriate template to generate comparative models and
showed sequence identities with cod Tf1-NE, Tf1-NW,
Tf2, MTf and OMP of 45%, 45%, 44%, 40% and 35%,
respectively. The template structure was then aligned
against the cod sequences using ClustalW program [74].
Each sequence alignment was then checked to ensure
that (i) all the secondary structural elements had a minimum number of insertions or deletions within them,
and (ii) Cys residues forming consensus disulfide bridges
were conserved [75]. Once an acceptable alignment had
been produced, an ensemble of 50 models of the five
different cod proteins were built using MODELLER v.
9.7 [76] as implemented in Discovery Studio (Accelrys
Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) and ranked using the MODELLER objective function, which is highly efficient in
ranking different models calculated from the same

Andersen et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:51
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/51

alignment. It should be noted that the disulfide bridges
between conserved Cys were not included as a restraint
in the modeling process, but that the relative position of
two Cys side chains in the resulting (unrestrained)
model led us to suggest the existence of a disulfide. The
stereochemical quality of the structures was assessed by
PROCHECK [77] supplemented by the profile programs
VERIFY3D [78] and ProSA-web [79]. In order to assess
the reliability of each model, the corresponding energy
graphs were compared with the template 2HAU
structure.
Phylogenetic analyses

Database searches were used to identify in total 40
amino acid sequences from teleost species, Ciona intestinalis and man (Additional file 6: Table S4). The Cterminal domain of Tf and MTf sequences was aligned
with OMP sequences using ClustalX [80] and by manual
editing. The final alignment consisted of 40 taxa and
330 characters. The best evolution model based on the
sequence alignment was determined using ProtTest [81].
The sequences were used to infer the phylogeny in a
Bayesian framework applying the program MrBayes
v3.1.2 [82]. The Bayesian inferences were done as follows: two independent runs, each with three cold and
one heated MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) chains
were started from a random starting tree. The two runs
lasted for 5,000,000 generations. The covarion (COV)
model was used together with the WAG+G+I to accommodate for different substitution rates across sites (G +
proportion of invariable sites (I)) and across sequences
(COV). The maximum likelihood (ML) tree was estimated using the program RAxML v.6 [83]. The topology
with the highest likelihood score out of 100 heuristic
searches, each from a random starting tree, was selected,
and bootstrapping was done with 100 pseudoreplicates
and one heuristic search per replicate. In the ML analyses, the WAG model with a gamma-distributed rate of
variation across sites (G) was employed. All phylogenetic
analyses were done on the freely available Bioportal at
University of Oslo http://www.bioportal.uio.no. The NeiGojobori method [84] implemented in DNAsp 5.0 was
used to calculate rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions in the identified Norwegian Tf1
cDNA sequence compared to the Canadian sequence
[44]. We then used the z-test in MEGA (4.0) to test for
positive selection.
Population sampling and SNP genotyping

In total 375 adult individuals were collected during
2002-2008 from 14 localities covering the geographical
region of the North Atlantic inhabited by Atlantic cod
(Table 1, Additional file 2; Figure S2). Genomic DNA
was extracted from fin clips, muscle tissue or gill

Page 11 of 14

arches, and six SNPs loci (Additional File 1: Figure S1)
spanning the Tf1 gene were genotyped for all individuals using the MassARRAY system from Sequenom
(San Diego, USA). PCR primers and extension primers
were designed using the software SpectroDESIGNER
v3.0 (Sequenom) (Additional file 5: Table S3). Genomic
DNA was PCR amplified as described [85], and the
SNP genotyping was performed according to the
iPLEX protocol from Sequenom available at http://
www.sequenom.com/iplex. For allele separations the
Sequenom MassARRAY Analyzer (Autoflex mass spectrometer) was used. Genotypes were assigned in real
time [86] using the MassARRAY SpectroTYPER RT
v3.4 software (Sequenom) based on the mass peaks
present. All results were manually inspected using
the MassARRAY Typer Analyzer v3.3 software
(Sequenom).
Statistical analyses of population genetic data

SNP heterozygosities and population differentiation
(FST) were calculated using Genepop 4.0.10 [87]. Statistical significance of population differentiation was
assessed using Fishers exact test implemented in
Genepop.
