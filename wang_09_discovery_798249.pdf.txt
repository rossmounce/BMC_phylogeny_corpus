Abstract
Background: The spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression largely depends on the presence
and absence of cis-regulatory sites in the promoter. In the economically highly important grass
family, our knowledge of transcription factor binding sites and transcriptional networks is still very
limited. With the completion of the sorghum genome and the available rice genome sequence,
comparative promoter analyses now allow genome-scale detection of conserved cis-elements.
Results: In this study, we identified thousands of phylogenetic footprints conserved between
orthologous rice and sorghum upstream regions that are supported by co-expression information
derived from three different rice expression data sets. In a complementary approach, cis-motifs
were discovered by their highly conserved co-occurrence in syntenic promoter pairs. Sequence
conservation and matches to known plant motifs support our findings. Expression similarities of
gene pairs positively correlate with the number of motifs that are shared by gene pairs and
corroborate the importance of similar promoter architectures for concerted regulation. This
strongly suggests that these motifs function in the regulation of transcript levels in rice and,
presumably also in sorghum.
Conclusion: Our work provides the first large-scale collection of cis-elements for rice and
sorghum and can serve as a paradigm for cis-element analysis through comparative genomics in
grasses in general.

Background
In higher eucaryotes, gene transcription is controlled by a
variety of mechanisms such as chromatin modifications
or degradation via complementary miRNAs. Gene promoters and their cis-regulatory element composition,
however, are the initial checkpoints for transcriptional
gene activities and define the potential spatiotemporal
expression of a gene. Among other aspects, knowledge of
the elementary functional units – transcription factor
binding sites – is a prerequisite to understanding regula-

tion of individual genes and their embedding into regulatory networks.
Numerous approaches, both experimental and in silico,
have been developed to uncover cis-regulatory elements
[1,2]. Chromatin immuno-precipitation combined with
microarrays/ChIP-on-chip provides direct experimental
evidence for Protein-DNA interactions on genome-scale
and is a powerful approach [3]. Yet, ChIP-on-chip is currently not easily applicable in many higher eucaryotes [4].

Other established experimental methods such as staggered promoter deletions or DNAseI footprints provide
high-resolution views of single promoters but are infeasible for large-scale analysis. To overcome experimental
limitations, computational methods have been developed
as time- and cost-effective complements for large-scale
motif discovery. These include mapping of known as well
as detection of de novo motifs, e.g. [5-8]. In general, two
types of data set are used for motif searches as sources of
information: a group of functionally related, e.g. coexpressed, genes and orthologous promoter sequences. In
the first case, candidate motifs are expected to be enriched
compared to a statistical background model. Hence, they
can be detected by their over-representation in the respective gene group. In the latter it is expected that non-functional regions will be considerably more diversified
compared to functional cis-elements. In a widely applied
approach, candidate sites emerge as conserved patterns or
phylogenetic footprints from (local) alignments between
evolutionary related sequences. Besides the use of single
informative sources, several tools have been developed
that combine conservation and co-expression information [9-11]. We applied PhyloCon in an earlier analysis
[9]. PhyloCon detects motifs in data sets for which promoter sequences of genes co-expressed in one species are
complemented with orthologous promoter sequences of
one or more related species. In the first step, motif discovery is undertaken between orthologous sequences and initial motifs are generated from local alignments. In the
second step, expression data are used to define groups of
genes co-expressed in one of the species. Subsequently
comparing and merging initial profiles between coexpression groups iteratively refines motifs. The combined application of two sources of information has been
demonstrated to provide increased predictive power compared to approaches using only one source, e.g. overrepresentation [9,12].
In contrast to motif discovery from a confined or userselected set of genes, network-level conservation detects
globally conserved motifs from comparison between two
genomes. Functional motifs are identified by their unusually high retention in orthologous promoter pairs in comparison to those anticipated from single genome
frequencies. An alignment-free implementation of the
network-level conservation principle, FASTCOMPARE,
has been successfully employed to motif discovery in
yeast, nematodes, fruit flies and humans [13]. In our study
we adopted FASTCOMPARE to study network-level conservation in sorghum and rice.
A large number of in silico studies to detect de novo cis-regulatory elements have been reported for the bakers yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and some of its relatives [14,15].
In yeast, evaluation of biologically meaningful motifs is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/284

supported by a plethora of experimentally verified motifs
as well as genome-wide ChIP-on-chip studies for transcriptional binding sites. Recently, progress in genome
projects of higher eucaryotes, e.g. vertebrates and the
genus Drosophila, has boosted motif discovery and our
understanding of regulatory networks in these organisms
[16]. In higher plants, however, thus far the lack of
sequences of evolutionarily closely related plant genomes
has restricted large-scale analysis mainly to dicotyledonous plants like the model system Arabidopsis thaliana
[17,18]. For the economically and agriculturally highly
important monocotyledonous plant genomes, however,
until recently only the rice genome sequence was available. This limited comparative genomics approaches to a
few hundred gene promoters for which orthologs in
monocots have been described and analyzed [19]. With
the completion and availability of the sorghum genome
this limitation has now been overcome and we are now in
a position to undertake genome-scale comparative studies
between evolutionarily related monocotyledonous
genomes.
Sorghum and rice belong to two different grass subfamilies, the Panicoideae and Bambusoideae, respectively
that diverged approximately 60 million years ago [20].
Though genome sizes differ twofold, gene number and
order are similar: about 60% of sorghum genes are located
in syntenic regions to rice and orthologous relationships
are well established by genetic markers as well as whole
genome comparisons [20,21]. In addition, transcriptome
data for rice that monitor genome-wide expression levels
of many thousands rice genes have become available in
recent years [22-24]. This now, for the first time, allows us
to analyze conserved sequence elements on a genome
scale and to detect candidates for transcription factor
binding sites between monocotyledonous species.
In this study, candidate cis-regulatory elements in rice and
sorghum have been elucidated by two complementary
approaches. Firstly, we derived transcriptional networks
in rice from correlation matrices of three independent rice
expression data sets. Groups of co-expressed rice genes are
obtained as maximal cliques of these networks and each
gene of a clique is complemented by its sorghum
ortholog. PhyloCon was applied to this data set to detect
motifs in upstream sequences that are both overrepresented in co-expressed genes and conserved between
orthologs. In a complementary approach, candidate
motifs were identified by their preferred genome-wide
conservation between syntenic promoters following the
"network-level conservation" approach of Elemento and
Tavazoie [13]. The numbers of motifs two genes have in
common correlate with their degree of co-expression.
Both methods provide the first large-scale collection of cis-

elements for rice and sorghum and indicate promising
approaches for cis-element discovery in grasses in general.

Results
Preparation of input data set
PhyloCon as well as network-level conservation use evolutionary conserved footprints for motif discovery. We
identified orthologs between Sorghum bicolor and the
genome of Oryza sativa ssp. japonica from syntenic regions
of the two species [20,25]. Tandem duplications of genes
frequently occur in plant genomes and typically comprise
approximately one fifth of all genes [25,26]. To avoid
complications by tandem duplications, we selected only
gene pairs from syntenic regions that were detected as
bidirectional best Blastp hits. In total, 15,773 orthologous
gene pairs were identified. Comparison of upstream
regions that have been deduced from incorrect gene starts
can strongly impair motif discovery between orthologs.
Thus, we restricted our analysis to those 12,129 gene pairs
that fulfilled our stringent criteria for aligned orthologous
N-termini (see Methods).
Detection of locally overrepresented motifs: PhyloCon
analysis
PhyloCon analysis is based on the comparison of conserved sequence profiles from orthologous pairs that are
joined via co-expression of genes from a reference
genome. In this study co-expressed genes in rice were
deduced from three different whole-genome expression
data sets: MPSS data for several tissues and abiotic stresses
[23], and two oligonucleotide array experiments covering
developmental stages, various tissues [22] as well as
drought and salt stress conditions [24]. In the following,
we refer to the array experiments measuring developmental stages and tissues as YALE-1, while the array describing
expression data for stress conditions is termed YALE-2. In
total, the experiments comprise 213 individual measurements or arrays, respectively. Figure 1 shows an overview
of the motif discovery scheme applied in this study.

As it is highly problematic to combine expression data
derived from different platforms, functional groups were
identified separately for each of the three expression sets.
Firstly, we assigned MPSS tags as well as 70 mers of the oligonucleotide arrays to the current rice RAP2 gene predictions and selected genes that show significant expression
levels (see Methods). Of the RAP2 gene models, 19,396
had an MPSS tag that unambiguously mapped to one
gene model. The oligonucleotide arrays contain a total of
58,404 70 mers of which 27,887 had a unique match to
the RAP2 gene annotation. For the YALE-1 experiment, we
obtained significant measurements for 13,904 genes
while 20,633 genes showed reliable expressions in the
YALE-2 arrays (see Methods).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/284

To analyze for co-expressed genes we calculated an all
against all Pearson correlation matrix. For each expression
set, co-expressed genes were defined as pairs whose Pearson correlation exceeded the 99%-quantile of the background distribution of all correlation coefficients.
Background and quantiles were estimated from the allagainst all Pearson correlation matrix. Next, an undirected
graph with nodes representing genes and edges between
them if genes were co-expressed, was constructed. From
this graph, co-expressed gene groups were extracted as
maximal cliques for each node. To avoid clusters with
broad or unspecific expression patterns, we restricted our
analysis to nodes with ≤ 100 edges. After filtering for
orthologs with congruent N-terminal alignments we
determined 4,683 cliques and 6,667 gene pairs for the
MPSS data, and for YALE-1 and YALE-2 4263 cliques with
4,395 pairs, and 2,185 cliques with 2,379 pairs. The
resulting co-expression groups were subjected to a PhyloCon analysis. Initially, we detected 5,337, 14,754 and
17,068 position specific scoring matrices (PSSM) from the
YALE-2, YALE-1 and MPSS derived cliques, respectively.
After filtering for simple repeats, the expected frequency in
rice upstream regions was determined for the detected
PSSM's. For each co-expression group we tested whether
the respective PSSMs were statistically overrepresented
(see Methods). To obtain a set of non-redundant motifs
for each data set, similar PSSMs were subsequently
merged to one motif by hierarchical clustering (see Methods). As regrouping of PSSMs to one motif can potentially
alter its significance we retested statistical over-representation of the newly formed motifs as described above. This
procedure resulted in 1,622 MPSS motifs, 1,500 YALE-1
motifs and 866 motifs from the YALE-2 data set. A list of
sites supported both by sequence conservation as well as
co-expression is provided (see additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
&6).
Detection of globally overrepresented motifs: Networklevel conservation
PhyloCon deduces motifs from a well-defined subset of
co-expressed genes and their orthologs. In contrast, network-level conservation finds motifs by their global, i.e.
genome-wide high conservation rate within syntenic promoters. Our approach followed the FASTCOMPARE
method as described in Elemento and Tavazoie with some
modifications [13,27]. Briefly, we investigated a k-mer
search space of 6 mers up to 9 mers. As many transcription
factor binding sites tolerate a certain degree of sequence
degeneracy, we allowed for up to three variable positions
within the k-mers. For exact words, a full enumeration of
all possible k-mers was analyzed. For searches allowing
variable positions we applied time-effective heuristics. In
addition, we included symmetric dyad motifs of the general format X{2,4}-N{2-16}-X{2,4} to cover these binding site patterns. We also tested by a heuristic technique

Figure 1
Workflow of cis-element discovery in rice and sorghum
Workflow of cis-element discovery in rice and sorghum. Two complementary approaches have been employed for
motif discovery. Starting from orthologous gene pairs between rice and sorghum, orthologous upstream sequences have been
isolated. These sequences were used to identify motifs with a high conservation rate between syntenic pairs compared to their
single genome frequencies (network-level conservation approach). For PhyloCon, orthologous pairs that were supported by
co-expression were combined to orthologous groups and were subjected to a PhyloCon analysis. Motifs were consecutively
filtered for repeats and merged by clustering. Statistical significance has been re-evaluated for each of the clustered motifs. For
further details, see text and Methods.

whether specific nucleotides at initially unspecified positions within the spacer of a dyad could result in higher
scoring motifs.
The number of occurrences of k-mers per gene has been
determined for 2 kb upstream regions of the 12,129 syntenic gene pairs separately for both sorghum and rice
genes. To score k-mers, the expected overlap for co-occurrence in syntenic pairs were calculated from single
genome frequencies. Ratios of the observed and expected
number of co-occurrences were normalized and transformed to z-scores. Motifs with an over-representation of
two standard deviations above the mean (z-score ≥ 2)

were selected as candidate motifs. This role was also supported by their unusually high degree of global conservation. Of these candidate motifs, many motifs are size
variants of one core motif. For example, one of our motifs,
AACCCTA, resembles some previously described plant telomere repeats (AAACCCT)n and is highly similar to the
telo-box that has been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana
as a cis-regulatory element active in meristematic cells
[28,29]. Besides the sequence of this telo-box like motif,
several size and degeneracy variants (e.g. AAACCC, AACCCTAG) were also highly overrepresented in our dataset.
In order to deduce a non-redundant list of significant
motifs, only the highest scoring k-mers were retained

Page 4 of 15

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:284

from size variants. Applying this motif clustering schema,
3,806 k-mers (including 457 dyad motifs) were recovered
for further analysis (Table 1, Additional files 7, 8). As
described previously, initial dyad motifs were allowed to
converge to higher scoring, more specific motifs. We
detected many cases for which a large fraction of spacer
positions converted to specific letters (Table 2). Several
dozens of these motifs show a very rare occurrence (3 ≤ n
< 10) in the 12,129 syntenic upstream sequences of rice
and sorghum but a very large fraction of occurrences in
single species are conserved between syntenic pairs (Table
2). Long and unusually highly conserved motifs may provide a highly specific site or several binding sites in close
proximity to ensure a coherent regulation of the respective
genes, at least in one biological process or response. Cofunctionality of genes sharing such sites is supported by
several of our gene groups. The motif CACGNGNTTTGAC
is conserved in two WRKY transcription factors and a
seven-helix transmembrane protein homolog to the Mlo1
gene from barley. WRKY transcription factors as well as
the Mlo1 gene have been experimentally linked to primary pathogen responses [30,31]. In another group, histones H2A and H2B as well as a high mobility group I/Y2 are present. All these proteins are known to build or
dynamically interact with chromatin structures. For the
motif GCTCTNCNCNAAGA, conserved occurrences are
found for enzymes of the phenylpropanoid- and lignin
metabolism,
two
hydroxyanthranilate-hydroxycinnamoyltransferases and a ferulate-5-hydroxylase.
Validations of detected motifs
To validate our motifs derived from network-level conservation and PhyloCon analysis, we compared our findings
to previous reports on rice. The PLACE and TRANSFAC
databases were searched for matches between our motifs
and known sites. PLACE and TRANSFAC currently contain 74 and 55 sequences of rice transcription factor binding sites, respectively [32,6]. However, many sites are
redundant between the databases (or even within one
database) or represent binding site variations. Hence, the
exact number of different motifs is difficult to assess. In
our search we also included motifs originally described in
other plant species as cross-conservation has been
reported for functional cis-elements [33]. Using literature
searches as well as public databases containing known rice
binding sites, we found 559 of our motifs matching 43
known regulatory sites out of 96 distinct sequences in
both databases (see Table 1, 2 and Additional files 7, 8).
In addition, motifs extracted from literature searches but
not present in databases have been detected, for instance
a perfect match to the ethylene response element
GGGCCC and motifs highly similar to the telo-box AAACCCTA reported in Arabidopsis thaliana (see above).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/284

Figure 2 depicts two known cis-elements conferring transcriptional ABA responses, the G-box related ABA
response element (ABRE) and the coupling element 3
(CE3) as an example of co-conservation [34]. The full list
of network-level conserved motifs is provided as additional files (see additional files 7, 8).
Responses to environmental changes and expression patterns in higher eucaryotes frequently result from the combinatorial actions of two or more transcription factors that
bind to several distinct cis-elements within a promoter
[35]. For functional elements that control transcriptional
activities, it is therefore expected that the number of
shared elements of a gene pair will correlate with its
expression similarity. For rice promoter pairs we analyzed
the relation of co-occurrence of motifs detected by network-level conservation and their expression congruency.
Expression similarity between a rice gene pair was measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient. To determine
particular candidate motifs for a rice gene, all significant
motifs were selected that were present in both upstream
sequences of a rice gene and its respective syntenic sorghum partner. Pairs were binned according to the number
of motifs they have in common, and for each bin we
determined the mean Pearson correlation from its members. As shown in Figure 3, a positive association between
the number of shared motifs and the Pearson correlation
coefficient for MPSS and YALE2 but not for YALE1 data
was detected. Chi-square tests show significant deviations
from independency (df = 72; chi-square sums 3128 and
6046 for MPSS and YALE-2, respectively, p-value < 2 × 10–
16). Positive correlation was confirmed by a non-parametric, one-sided Wilcoxon rank test (p-value pMPSS <
10–16, pYALE-2 < 10–16). YALE-1 was not significant (pvalue pYALE-1~1.0).

Discussion and conclusion
Rice genome projects have generated in depth genomic
datasets and a comprehensive set of genomic upstream
sequences. However, promoter sequences from other
grass genomes have become available only sporadically.
Comparative or computational biology approaches were
therefore restricted to studies of individual pairs of interest and limited by the availability of only a few hundreds
of grass promoter sequences. Our knowledge of cis-regulatory elements in monocotyledonous plants by the low
number of known transcription factor binding sites is limited to those that have been reported and deposited in
plant motif databases. The few dozens of known motifs
are in sharp contrast to findings that higher plant
genomes typically encode on average more than 1,500
transcription factors [36,37].

Table gives motif examples with a high conservation rate in rice-sorghum orthologs. A full list of detected motifs is provided in additional files 7 and
8. The number of genes (out of 12,129 syntenic genes) in rice and sorghum containing the respective motif in their upstream sequence are shown
in the columns '#rice' and '#sorghum', respectively. The following columns show the number of expected and observed co-occurrences in syntenic
pairs, as well as the z-score. Matches to known sites/motifs are indicated in the last two columns.

upstream sequences has now become feasible. In this survey, we employed approaches based on two different
tools, PhyloCon and FASTCOMPARE. Both tools and
approaches have been successfully applied to motif discovery in many non-plant organisms including yeast and
mammals. In addition, PhyloCon has previously been
applied with success to cis-element analysis in genome
survey sequences of Brassica oleraceae vs. Arabidopsis thaliana [13,18].

related species and functional network motifs can be
detected by their higher global or genome-wide conservation rate compared to non-functional sequences. Evolutionary conservation of functional elements is also
assumed for phylogenetic footprinting that discovers
motifs from a group of orthologous gene pairs. For the
analysis based on PhyloCon, the orthologous groups that
are compared and combined result from a prior selection
of orthologous mate-pairs by co-expression analysis.

FASTCOMPARE is based on the 'network-level conservation' principle. This presupposes that regulatory circuitries
will be largely conserved between two evolutionary

Ab initio analysis of cis-regulatory elements is notoriously
error-prone due to small motif sizes and motif degeneracy. Our study was designed to select functional candidate

Examples for long specific motifs are shown that emerged from dyad motifs with initially unspecified spacer sequences (denoted as N). Note that
many motifs have a low occurrence rate in rice and sorghum; however, most or all occurrences are conserved between orthologous pairs.

Co-conservation of two ABA-response elements in LEA promoters
Co-conservation of two ABA-response elements in LEA promoters. The alignment of two rice upstream sequences
with their respective sorghum syntenic partners is shown. Pairs are marked as light blue and yellow frames. The rice genes
Os01g0705200 and Os05g0542500 have been annotated as late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins. Two known ABA
response elements, ABRE and CE3 (dark blue frames), are highly conserved in position and inter-motif distance between all
four promoters. Functionality of a similar motif arrangement has been reported for other ABA responsive rice genes [34].
Additional motifs that are conserved between a rice-sorghum pair but not in all four promoters are shown as red frames and
may indicate different responses between the pairs. Gray frames, pink and light green fragment depict potential TATA box,
annotated transcript and annotated coding region, respectively.

sites and motifs that are associated with transcriptional
activity. Co-expression was derived from correlations
exceeding the top 1% of background similarities. Additionally, our clique approach required all group members
to have a significant expression correlation with all other
group members. In our survey, we restricted motif
searches to 5'-upstream sequences of size 2 kb (for k-mer
searches) or 3 kb (for PhyloCon) (i) to model current
knowledge of plant promoter sizes and, (ii) to focus on
plant core promoters that presumably contain most functional elements. Though functional enhancers and cis-elements in e.g. mammalian promoters, have been reported
up to several tens of thousands bases distant to transcription initiation sites (TIS), plant promoters seem to be
more compact [38]. In addition, chance co-occurrences
will strongly increase, in particular, for smaller k-mers and
degenerated motifs. Upstream sequences of larger size
would thus have adverse effects by accumulating false
positives or losing statistical power.
Results reported in this study can be divided into two categories: conserved sites and motifs. PhyloCon position
specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) are supported by their
conservation between orthologous promoters and their
simultaneous co-occurrence in genes with expression similarities. Sizes of cis-elements in plants are comparable to
non-plant species and typically range between 6 and 12
base pairs [5,6]. The mean size of PhyloCon PSSMs
detected in this study was considerably longer (37 bp).
Hence PSSMs likely represent concrete conserved sites
rather than generalized statistical models for transcription
factors. Large sizes for phylogenetic footprints in grasses
are consistent with a previous study of 288 maize and rice
pairwise and 56 rice, maize and sorghum three-way comparisons, in which a minimum motif size ≥ 20 bp was
found to be significant [19]. Such long sites for PhyloCon
PSSMs can be composed of two or more motifs and close
proximity of these sites is required for functionality in the
respective co-expressed group. Alternatively, some of the
detected sites could represent signals associated with transcriptional gene activity such as mRNA stability signals or
miRNA target sites, for which longer sizes have been
reported [39]. Complementary to these long conserved
regions, many of the detected network-level conserved
motifs represent candidates for transcription factor binding sites. After subjecting the individual detected sites to
clustering, in total 3,809 non-redundant motifs were
found. The rice genome contains more than 1,600 genes
encoding transcription factors and a similar number of cisregulatory motifs could be expected [37]. However, some
of our motifs may still be too specific and one transcription factor may bind to several related motifs. Consistent
with this assumption, only for few k-mer positions did we
observe sequence variability indicating that scoring functions favor specific k-mers or overrepresented k-mers with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/284

an overall low occurrence rate in a genome. Furthermore,
many of these motifs were obtained from dyadic motif
searches that converged to motifs with highly specified
spacer sequences. For these long motifs, similar considerations may apply as for PhyloCon sites discussed above.
Taking this into account, the number of motifs reported in
this study is close to the number of transcription factors
present in rice. On the other hand, our method may have
missed transcription factor binding sites that tolerate high
degeneracy. Similar findings for highly degenerated
motifs have been reported for a FASTCOMPARE analysis
in yeast [13]. Nevertheless, our list of motifs up to now
provides the most comprehensive analysis of cis-elements
in a grass genome.
In previous studies, the functionality of motifs has been
confirmed by a variety of approaches. Many surveys have
reported an association of motifs with particular biological processes. For large-scale analysis, gene ontologies or
metabolic pathways were correlated with particular
motifs. In this study, however, we were only able to detect
a few such associations, and all enrichments were in very
broad biological categories, e.g. 'transcription' (see Methods, results not shown). Missing associations likely result
from limitations of the current rice GO annotation. In our
search, we found for only 755 RAP2 rice genes (2.7%) at
least one GO term belonging to the category 'biological
process'. Similarly, only 1,376 rice genes (4.9%) could be
mapped on KEGG pathways. In total, a functional annotation has been found for less than 5% of all rice genes.
The sparse data basis and low resolution of the current rice
GO annotation that mostly assigns top level terms, are the
most probable causes for the limited success in detecting
significant enrichments.
Several findings support the functionality of our motifs.
PhyloCon sites are associated with conservation and coexpression. Despite the limited availability of experimentally verified cis-regulatory elements in grasses, we find
numerous matches to known plant motifs or sites in public databases and literature reports. This includes many
variants of the ACGT motif, like the G-box or the ABA
response element as well as ethylene response elements
among others. Interestingly, some top-scoring motifs do
not match previously published elements and indicate
novel cis-regulatory motifs. The number of motifs two rice
genes has in common positively correlates with their
expression similarity. This is consistent with the combinatorial nature of transcription regulation [40,35] and
strongly indicates that a large fraction of detected motifs
are associated with control of transcription. Control may
be exerted as transcription factor binding sites or, as discussed previously, as miRNA target sites or signals for
mRNA stability.

In summary, motifs reported in this study will provide
researchers with a prioritized list of candidates for the
gene of interest and can guide experimental designs for
numerous sorghum and rice genes. Additional grass
genome projects, for instance Brachypodium distachyon, a
wheat relative, and maize are well advanced and can be
expected to deliver important and information-rich comparative genome templates in the future [41]. This will
enable and stimulate whole-genome comparative studies
between three and more grass genome sequences. In particular, comparisons between two closely related grasses,
maize and sorghum, will allow (i) branch-specific motifs
to be accessed and, at the same time, (ii) the identification
of motifs common to the monocot clade.

Methods
Determination of orthologous upstream sequences
between rice and sorghum
Syntenic blocks between rice and sorghum have been
described in [20]. To address possible complications
caused by paralogs and tandem duplications, orthologs
were selected by bidirectional best BlastP hits located in
corresponding syntenic regions. To avoid misassignments
caused by erroneous gene models, we restricted our analysis to gene pairs for which pairwise alignments included
regions before the 15th amino acid of either protein
sequence. In total, 12,192 orthologous gene pairs were
selected. Upstream sequences were defined as genomic
sequences from the start codon to the start of the
upstream preceding gene, with a maximal distance of 3 kb
(PhyloCon analysis) and 2 kb (network-level conservation analysis). For sorghum we used gene models version
1.4 of [20], for rice the RAP2 gene annotation was used
[25].
Rice expression data processing
We used three different large-scale rice expression data
sets, denoted as MPSS [23], YALE-1 [22] and YALE-2 [24].

The 70 mer oligonucleotides used on the YALE-1 and 2
arrays as well as the MPSS tag sequences were remapped
to rice gene models of the RAP2 annotation. For both
probe sets, only probes that unambiguously identify
exactly one gene were used for the analysis. In cases in
which no UTR information was available, for the respective transcript 100 bp of the respective 3'-downstream and
5'-upstream genomic sequence were added. For MPSS
tags, we analyzed only the probe located nearest to the 3'end of the transcript as this is expected to be the most
informative [42,43]. In total, unambiguous mappings for
22,271 MPSS signatures and for 27,887 oligonucleotide
probes were found and used for the subsequent analysis.
Filters were employed to identify signatures or oligonucleotide probes that were expressed abnormally rarely or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/284

could be generated by systematic errors. Starting from
22,271 mapped MPSS signatures, a total of 19,396 reliable and significant signatures were selected as described in
[42,43]. YALE-1 data was normalized [22] and the strategy
described in [44] was employed to derive a threshold for
expressed probes. We determined an intensity cut-off of
410 with a 5% false positive rate (see additional file 9). In
total, 13,904 rice genes/probes showed significant expression levels. For YALE-2, we adopted filter results from the
original analysis resulting in 20,633 reliably expressed
probes [23].
Determination of co-expressed groups
For all expression datasets we determined background distributions of pairwise expression similarities from an allagainst all Pearson correlation matrix. The 99%-quantile
of these distributions was considered as significant for a
pair to be defined as co-expressed. Thresholds rmin for
Pearson correlation coefficients were r = 0.79, r = 0.88, r =
0.93 for MPSS, YALE-1 and YALE-2, respectively (see additional file 10). In total, for 16,426, 13,223 and 18,820 distinct genes at least one co-expressed rice gene could be
identified from the MPSS, YALE-1 and YALE-2 distributions respectively.

Networkx was used https://networkx.lanl.gov/wiki to
detect co-expressed gene groups in expression graphs. For
an anchor gene its maximal clique was determined. We
restricted our search to anchor genes with less than 100
edges. Identical cliques derived from different anchor
genes were removed. Finally, 6,677 cliques covering
15,146 genes from MPSS data, 7,456 cliques including
11,412 genes from YALE-1 and 6,681 cliques comprising
8,793 genes for YALE-2 were retrieved.
PhyloCon Motif discovery
To generate PhyloCon input data sets, only rice genes having an assigned ortholog in the 12,129 syntenic pairs ricesorghum pairs were used. Cliques containing less than
three pairs were discarded. The final MPSS, YALE-1 and
YALE-2 datasets circumvented 4683, 4263 and 2185
cliques respectively, and included 6667, 4395 and 2379
rice genes, respectively.

PhyloCon was downloaded from http://ural.wustl.edu/
~twang/PhyloCon/[9]. Parameters for PhyloCon were
selected as described previously [18]. Motif profiles
reported by PhyloCon were transformed into PSSMs from
alignments of all sorghum and rice instances. Transformation as well as statistical tests for motif overrepresentation
under binomial distribution was performed as previously
described [18]. P-values were adjusted for multiple
hypotheses testing applying the Benjamini-Hochberg
method [45] to correct for a false discovery rate of 5%.
Overall 17068, 14754 and 5337 PSSMs were obtained

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:284

from the MPSS, YALE-1 and -2 datasets, respectively. Simple repeats like motifs (GC)n were discarded.
Based on sequence similarities motif profiles were clustered. To estimate the similarity of two profiles, multiple
sequence alignments of all instances were generated using
ClustalW 1.74 (gap opening penalty 1000 and gap extending penalty 0.001). The alignment score was the sum of
column scores (match, mismatch and gap scoring 1,-1,-2,
respectively) and normalized by size.
A similarity matrix based on all-against all pairwise PSSM
alignments were constructed and hierarchical 'bottom
up'-clustering was performed using the R package hclust.
Clusters were determined by the cut-off corresponding to
one-sided 5% significance deduced from the entire similarity matrix.
Discovery of network-level conserved motifs
We followed the protocol of Elemento and Tavazoie [13].
We analyzed motif sizes ranging from 6 to 9-mers.
Genome-wide conservation scores were calculated as
ratios between observed numbers of co-occurrences in
syntenic pairs versus the expected numbers. Transformation to z-scores allows the comparison of scores for motifs
of different sizes.

Many transcription factors tolerate some degree of variability for particular site positions. Motifs searched for in
this study were therefore represented as regular expressions and the (full) search space is represented by all possible subsets of the sequence space. We applied a heuristic
approach to explore the search space. For each exact word,
we randomly selected one position to which we added a
randomly selected nucleotide. For each round of degeneration, we repeated this procedure four times. For each
exact word, we analyzed 100 independent iterations.
Many significant motifs represent size (or regular expression) variations of one common motif theme or may be
reported as significant because a subword/-string is significant. We defined a motif to be derived from another
motif if it constitutes a (sub-)word of this motif. For variable positions, both motifs had to have overlapping specifities. To reduce redundancy, we ordered motifs according
to their score, and removed all motifs from this list that
were derived from a higher scoring motif.
We investigated dyad motifs with patterns of type
{X}a{N}b{X}a, where X represents a specific letter, N represents any letter from the nucleotide alphabet, and a and
b range from 2 to 4 and 4 to 12, respectively. A greedy
scheme was applied to test whether more specified versions of the initially unspecific spacer sequence results in
a higher scoring motif. For each position in the spacer, we

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/284

determined the highest scoring representation of all 15
subset variations of the nucleotide alphabet, for instance
{A},{AC},{AG} and so on. Next, we replaced each spacer
position by its locally highest scoring letter representation
starting from the position with the highest score improvement to the second, third and so on improvements.
Motifs were re-scored after each replacement. Iterations
were repeated as long as the total score of the motif
increased.
Validations
All statistical tests as well as multiple hypothesis testing
corrections were carried out using R routines implemented in the R package stats.

The rice gene ontology (GO) categories were downloaded
from the GO database (http://www.geneontology.org/
GO.current.annotations.shtml, 2008) and metabolic and
molecular interaction pathways were identified in the
KEGG database http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/path
way.html. Due to different rice annotation versions
between these databases and the gene set used in this
study, protein sequences corresponding to GO and/or
KEGG pathways were remapped to our RAP2 cDNAs by
either TBLASTN or BLASTN.
Comparisons against experimentally reported TFBSs were
undertaken against all sites from the TRANSFAC (TRANSFAC
7.0,
2005,
http://www.biobase.de/
index.php?id=transfac) and PLACE databases (PLACE
30.0, 2007, http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE/). In total,
96 non-redundant known rice sites were extracted from
both databases. A multiple alignment between a known
site and all sites included in the corresponding profile was
generated and the alignment score was estimated as
described above. For network-level conserved k-mers,
string pattern matching was employed.

Determination of significant and reliable expression levels in YALE-1.
Significantly expressed probes have been determined according to [44].
Background expression is derived from all measurements of 58,404 oligonucleotide probes in 42 experiments. For each expression intensity, the
percentage of measurements exceeding the respective expression level has
been determined for two classes: (i) probes for which two or more replicates fell below the respective threshold and (ii) probes having higher
intensities for 3 or more replicates. The x-axis depicts expression levels
measured as the intensity of Cy5 dye, the y-axis the percentage of total
measurements. For YALE-1, we found an expression intensity of 410 corresponding to the top 5% of all measurements.
