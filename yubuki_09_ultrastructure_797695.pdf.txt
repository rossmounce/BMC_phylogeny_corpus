Abstract
Background: The Euglenozoa is a large group of eukaryotic flagellates with diverse modes of
nutrition. The group consists of three main subclades – euglenids, kinetoplastids and diplonemids
– that have been confirmed with both molecular phylogenetic analyses and a combination of shared
ultrastructural characteristics. Several poorly understood lineages of putative euglenozoans live in
anoxic environments, such as Calkinsia aureus, and have yet to be characterized at the molecular
and ultrastructural levels. Improved understanding of these lineages is expected to shed
considerable light onto the ultrastructure of prokaryote-eukaryote symbioses and the associated
cellular innovations found within the Euglenozoa and beyond.
Results: We collected Calkinsia aureus from core samples taken from the low-oxygen seafloor of
the Santa Barbara Basin (580 – 592 m depth), California. These biflagellates were distinctively
orange in color and covered with a dense array of elongated epibiotic bacteria. Serial TEM sections
through individually prepared cells demonstrated that C. aureus shares derived ultrastructural
features with other members of the Euglenozoa (e.g. the same paraxonemal rods, microtubular
root system and extrusomes). However, C. aureus also possessed several novel ultrastructural
systems, such as modified mitochondria (i.e. hydrogenosome-like), an "extrusomal pocket", a highly
organized extracellular matrix beneath epibiotic bacteria and a complex flagellar transition zone.
Molecular phylogenies inferred from SSU rDNA sequences demonstrated that C. aureus grouped
strongly within the Euglenozoa and with several environmental sequences taken from low-oxygen
sediments in various locations around the world.
Conclusion: Calkinsia aureus possesses all of the synapomorphies for the Euglenozoa, but lacks
traits that are specific to any of the three previously recognized euglenozoan subgroups. Molecular
phylogenetic analyses of C. aureus demonstrate that this lineage is a member of a novel euglenozoan
subclade consisting of uncharacterized cells living in low-oxygen environments. Our ultrastructural
description of C. aureus establishes the cellular identity of a fourth group of euglenozoans, referred
to as the "Symbiontida".

Background
The Euglenozoa is a clade of eukaryotic microorganisms
with very diverse lifestyles and that tentatively falls within
one of six emerging supergroups of eukaryotes, namely
the "Excavata" [1-3]. Most euglenozoans cluster within
three major subgroups that have been established with
both molecular phylogenetic analyses and combination
of ultrastructural characteristics (e.g. the same tripartite
flagellar root system): the Kinetoplastida, the Euglenida
and the Diplonemida [3-8]. Kinetoplastids possess mitochondria with a uniquely structured genome, called "kinetoplast" DNA, and the group includes both free-living
phagotrophic lineages (e.g. bodonids) and parasitic lineages (e.g. trypanosomatids such as Trypanosoma and Lieshmania). Euglenids possess a cytoskeleton, or "pellicle",
consisting of overlapping proteinaceous strips that are
arranged either longitudinally or helically, and the group
includes bacteriovorous lineages (e. g. Petalomonas),
eukaryovorous lineages (e.g. Peranema), osmotrophic lineages (e.g. Menodinium) and photosynthetic lineages (e.g.
Euglena). The mitochondria of kinetoplastids and euglenids possess cristae that are distinctively discoidal in
shape. By contrast, diplonemids consist of only two genera, Diplonema and Rhynchopus, with sack-shaped cells,
short flagella and flattened mitochondrial cristae and
without kinetoplast DNA, pellicle strips, and paraxonemal rods.
Ultrastructural studies have also demonstrated lineages of
euglenozoans that do not fall neatly within any of the
three established subgroups, such as Postgaardi mariagerensis, which inhabits low oxygen environments and is covered with epibiotic bacteria [9]. Currently, P. mariagerensis
is grouped together with another poorly understood
anoxic flagellate, namely Calkinsia aureus, as incertae sedis
within the Euglenozoa [3]; although molecular data is
unavailable for both species, one author has chosen to
classify them within a taxon called the "Postgaardea"
[10,11]. C. aureus was originally collected from anoxic
sediments near Woods Hole, MA (USA) and described
with only line drawings as a member of the euglenid family Petalomonidae; this conclusion was based on the
appearance of a rigid cell containing strip-like surface striations [12]. However, C. aureus was subsequently collected from low-oxygen sediments in the Santa Barbara
Basin, CA (USA) and partially studied with light and scanning electron microscopy (LM and SEM, respectively)
[13,14]. These studies demonstrated that like P. mariagerensis, C. aureus was covered with the rod-shape epibiotic
bacteria, rather than pellicle strips per se.
The ultrastructure and molecular phylogenetic position of
C. aureus is currently unknown. These data are expected to
help establish robust inferences about the overall diversity
of euglenozoans and the ultrastructure of prokaryote-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/16

eukaryote symbioses within the group and beyond. The
main goals of this study were to characterize the
ultrastructure and molecular phylogenetic position of C.
aureus using small subunit (SSU) rDNA sequences and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of serially sectioned cells. Our results demonstrated that C. aureus is the
first member of a novel group of anoxic euglenozoans –
referred to here as the "Symbiontida" – to be characterized
at both the molecular and ultrastructural levels. A companion study centered on the molecular identity and
detailed ultrastructure of the epibiotic bacteria on C.
aureus is currently underway.

Methods
Collection of organisms
Calkinsia aureus was collected using a Soutar box corer or
MC-800 multi corer from the sea floor sediment (580 –
592 m in depth) of the Santa Barbara Basin, California,
USA in September of 2007 and June of 2008. Sediment
core samples were collected on the R/V Robert Gordon
Sproul. Some sediment samples were immediately fixed
for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with an
equal volume of 4% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.2 M
sodium cacodylate buffer (SCB) (pH 7.2) and stored at
4°C. The remaining sediment samples were stored in 50
ml plastic tubes at 4°C and subsequently processed for
light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
and DNA extraction.
Light and electron microscopy
Light micrographs of over 100 living cells were taken
using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging microscope and a Leica
DC500 digital chilled CCD camera.

Cells of C. aureus were prepared for SEM by mixing an
equal volume of fixative solution containing 4% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.2 M SCB (pH 7.2) at room temperature.
The fixed cells were mounted on polycarbonate Millipore
filters (13-mm diam., 5-μm pore size) or glass plates
coated with poly-L-lysine at room temperature for 1 hr.
The cells were rinsed with 0.1 M SCB and fixed in 1%
osmium tetroxide for 30 min. The osmium-fixed cells
were then rinsed with 0.1 M SCB and dehydrated with a
graded ethanol series from 30% to absolute ethanol
before being critical point dried with CO2 using a Tousimis Critical Point Dryer. The dried cells were then coated
with gold using a Cressington 208HR High Resolution
Sputter Coater, and observed with a Hitachi S-4700 field
emission scanning electron microscope.
Cells of C. aureus prepared for TEM were kept in fixative
solution for two months before being individually isolated from the surrounding sediment in the sample. Isolated cells were rinsed with 0.2 M SCB (pH 7.2) three
times and then fixed in 1% (w/v) osmium tetroxide in 0.2

M SCB (pH 7.2) at room temperature for 1 hr before being
dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol and 100%
acetone. The dehydrated cells were then infiltrated with
acetone-Epon 812 resin mixtures and 100% resin. Individual cells were flat embedded and serial sectioned in different orientations (i.e. transverse and longitudinal).
Ultra-thin serial sections were collected on copper, Formvar-coated slot grids and stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl
acetate and lead citrate [15] before being observed using a
Hitachi H7600 electron microscope. A total of 899 micrographs from 12 different cells were observed.
Two different media were used in an attempt to culture C.
aureus: 5% of TYGM-9 (ATCC medium 1171) and 5% of
modified PYNFH medium (ATCC medium 1134), diluted
in anoxic and axenic seawater at 4°C. However, the cells
did not grow in either medium.
DNA extraction, PCR amplification, alignment and
phylogenetic analysis
Twenty individual cells of C. aureus that corresponded to
the original species description (distinctive color, size,
shape and motility [12]) were isolated from the sediment
and washed twice in sterilized seawater. Because of the
highly distinctive morphology of C. aureus and the precautions taken, the possibility of contamination is exceedingly low. Genomic DNA was extracted from the cells
using MasterPure Complete DNA and RNA purification
Kit (Epicentre, WI, USA). The polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) was performed using a total volume of 25 μl and
the PuRe Taq Ready-To-Go PCR beads kit (GE Healthcare,
Buckinghamshire, UK). Nearly the entire SSU rRNA gene
was amplified from genomic DNA using eukaryotic universal primers (PF1: 5'-GCGCTACCTGGTTGATCCTGCCAGT-3' and R4: 5'-GATCCTTCTGCAGGTTCACCTAC
-3'). The PCR protocol had an initial denaturation stage at
95°C for 2 min; 35 cycles involving 94°C for 45 s (denaturation), 55°C for 45 s (annealing), and 72°C for 1.5
min (extension); and final extension at 72°C for 5 min.
The amplified DNA fragments were purified from agarose
gels using UltraClean 15 DNA Purification Kit (MO Bio,
CA, USA), and then cloned into the TOPO TA Cloning Kit
(Invitrogen, CA, USA). The C. aureus sequence was deposited in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession
number EU753419.

The SSU rRNA sequence of C. aureus was visually aligned
with taxa representing all of the major groups of eukaryotes, forming (i) a 38-taxon alignment with ambiguously
aligned regions excluded (988 unambiguously aligned
positions). In order to more comprehensively evaluate the
phylogenetic position of C. aureus within the Euglenozoa,
we analyzed three additional datasets: (ii) a 35-taxon
alignment of euglenozoan sequences and ten relatively
short environmental sequences (760 unambiguously

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/16

aligned positions); (iii) a 29-taxon alignment of euglenozoan sequences including three fast-evolving euglenid
sequences – namely Astasia torta (AF403152), Menoidium
bibacillatum (AF247598) and Ploeotia costata (AF525486)
– and excluding the short environmental sequences (734
unambiguously aligned positions); and (iv) a 25-taxon
alignment of euglenozoan sequences excluding both the
short environmental sequences and the fastest-evolving
euglenid sequences (1025 unambiguously aligned positions). The highly divergent sequences from phagotrophic
euglenids produced a large number of ambiguously
aligned regions in the 35-taxon and 29-taxon alignments;
accordingly, these regions were excluded from our analyses.
PhyML [16] was used to analyze all four datasets (one
heuristic search per dataset) with maximum-likelihood
(ML) using a general-time reversible (GTR) model of base
substitutions [17] that incorporated invariable sites and a
discrete gamma distribution (eight categories) (GTR + I +
G model). The GTR model was selected using the program
MrAIC 1.4.3 with PhyML http://www.abc.se/~nylander/
mraic/mraic.html. Model parameters were estimated from
each of the original datasets. ML bootstrap analysis was
conducted with the same settings described above (100
pseudoreplicates; one heuristic search per pseudoreplicate).
The four alignments were also analyzed with Bayesian
methods using the MrBayes program [18]. The program
was set to operate with a gamma distribution and four
Monte-Carlo-Markov chains (MCMC) starting from a random tree. A total of 2,000,000 generations were calculated
with trees sampled every 50 generations and with a prior
burn-in of 100,000 generations (2000 sampled trees were
discarded; burn-in was checked manually). A majority
rule consensus tree was constructed from 38,000 postburn-in trees. Posterior probabilities correspond to the
frequency at which a given node was found in the postburn-in trees. Independent Bayesian runs on each alignment yielded the same results.

Results
General Morphology
Calkinsia aureus ranged from 41.7–71.2 μm long (average
length = 56.7 μm, n = 32) and from 14.5–23.3 μm wide
(average width = 18.3 μm, n = 32). The oval-shaped cells
were distinctively orange in color, dorsoventrally compressed, and possessed a tapered tail that was about 10
μm long (Figure 1). Two heterodynamic flagella were
inserted within a subapical depression at the anterior end
of the cell. The longer anterior flagellum was about twice
the length of the cell and was held straight forward during
gliding. The shorter posterior flagellum was half the
length of the cell and was usually positioned within a ventral groove. Colorless rod-shaped epibiotic bacteria were
oriented along the longitudinal axis of the cell (Figures
1B–D, 2). The posterior half of the cell usually contained
an accumulation of spherical food bodies, some of which
contained diatom frustules (Figures 1A–F, 3A–B). Cyst
formation and sexual reproduction were not observed.
Asexual reproduction was achieved by cell division along
the longitudinal axis of the cell. Following the replication
of the flagellar apparatus, a cleavage furrow formed at the
anterior end of the cell and advanced toward the posterior
end of the cell (Figure 1E).
Cell Surface and Extracellular Matrix
The longitudinally arranged, epibiotic bacteria consisted
of only one rod-shaped morphotype (3–5 μm long and
0.350 μm wide) that collectively formed a dense coat over
the entire surface of the host cell (Figures 2, 3A, 3C). At
least 128 epibiotic bacteria were observed in transverse
sections through one cell of C. aureus (Figure 3C). The cell
surface beneath the epibiotic bacteria consisted of seven
main layers (from outside to inside): (1) a glycocalyx, (2)
a highly organized extracellular matrix, (3) the host cell
membrane, (4) an array of parallel microtubules, (5) a
double-layered lamella, (6) superficially arranged mitochondrion-derived organelles and (7) cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Figures 3, 4, 5). The extracellular
matrix surrounded the entire cell except for the inside lining of the vestibulum, which leads to the flagellar pocket
and feeding pockets (Figures 2C, 3D–E). The portion of
the extracellular matrix positioned just inside the opening
of the vestibulum lacked epibiotic bacteria and consisted
of fine hair-like structures, or somatonemes (Figure 3E).
The extracellular matrix beneath the epibiotic bacteria was
coated with a thin glycocalyx (Figures 4B–D, 5). The extracellular matrix itself was bright orange, approximately 100
nm thick and perforated with hollow tubes that joined the
plasma membrane of the host with the glycocalyx beneath
the epibiotic bacteria (Figures 1G, 4A–C, 5).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/16

An array of evenly spaced microtubules was positioned
immediately beneath the plasma membrane of the host
(Figures 4A, 4C–D, 5). These microtubules were derived
from the dorsal lamina (DL) of the flagellar apparatus (see
description below). Each microtubule was connected to
neighboring microtubules with electron dense "arms"
(Figure 4D). A double-layered lamella was positioned
between the layer of microtubules and a deeper layer of
mitochondrion-derived organelles (Figures 4A–B, 4D).
The mitochondrion-derived organelles were discoidal in
shape, were bounded by two membranes and lacked
mitochondrial cristae or inclusions such as kinetoplasts
(Figures 4A–B, 4E). Moreover, we did not observe any evidence of euglenid-like pellicle features, such as the presence of S-shape proteinaceous strips or discontinuities in
the layer of microtubules.
Nucleus, Vestibulum and Associated Pockets
An anterior nucleus was positioned near the ventral side
of the cell and contained a prominent nucleolus and condensed chromosomes (Figures 3A, 3C–D). The vestibulum was positioned directly above the nucleus as this
space passed from the ventral, subapical opening toward
the dorsal side of the cell (Figure 3C). The vestibulum
then extended posteriorly along the dorsal side of the cell
and branched into three distinct pockets: (1) a novel
"extrusomal pocket", (2) a flagellar pocket and (3) a feeding pocket (Figures 3A, 3C; described in more detail
below). A battery of longitudinally arranged extrusomes
was connected to the base of the extrusomal pocket and
was nested within a notch on the dorsal side of the ventral
nucleus (Figures 1B, 3A, 3C). Each extrusome was about
160 nm in diam. (Figure 3G). The battery of extrusomes
was indistinguishable from the feeding rods of euglenids
when viewed with the light microscope, and discharged as
a single unit through the anterior opening (Figures 1B,
1H). The flagellar pocket was located on the dorsal side of
the cell and contained two flagella that inserted at the bottom of the pocket (Figures 6, 7; described in more detail
below). The feeding pocket was located to the right of the
flagellar pocket and extended horizontally before tapering
posteriorly toward the ventral side of the cell (Figures 8, 9;
described in more detail below).
Flagella, Transition zones and Basal Bodies
Both flagella contained a paraxonemal rod adjacent to the
axoneme, and flagellar hairs were not observed on either
flagellum (Figure 6A). The paraxonemal rod in the dorsal
flagellum (DF) had a whorled morphology in transverse
section, and the paraxonemal rod in the ventral flagellum
(VF) was constructed of a three-dimensional lattice of parallel fibers (Figures 6B, 6K). The entire length of the
axoneme had the standard 9+2 architecture of microtubules (Figure 6B). The central microtubules within each
axoneme terminated approximately 1 μm above the flag-

ellar insertion (Figures 6A, 6C); this 9 + 0 arrangement is
recognized as the transition zone in accordance with the
definition proposed by Hibberd [19]. The transition zone
and basal bodies are further described here from the distal
end toward the proximal end.
The central space within the proximal half of the transition zone contained three distinct elements: faint spokes
(denoted as 'a'), an outer concentric ring positioned just
inside the microtubular doublets (denoted as 'b'), and
electron dense globules (denoted as 'c') (Figures 6D, 6L).
Each faint spoke extended from a microtubular doublet
toward the center of the transition zone. The globules
were positioned at the intersections of each faint spoke
and the outer concentric ring (Figures 6D, 6L). In more
proximal points along the transition zone, nine "radial
connectives" extended from each doublet toward the flagellar membrane (Figures 6E–F), and an opaque core was

present within the central space when observed in both
longitudinal and transverse section (Figures 6A, 6F–G).
The opaque core consisted of six distinct elements: nine
spokes extending from each doublet (denoted as 'a'), the
outer concentric ring (denoted as 'b'), nine electron dense
globules associated with the outer concentric ring
(denoted as 'c'), a central electron dense hub (denoted as
'd'), an inner concentric ring (denoted as 'e') and nine
radial connectives extending from each doublet to the
flagellar membrane (denoted as 'f') (Figures 6F, 6M). The
radial connectives disappeared just above the distal
boundary of the basal body (Figures 6A, 6G), and the elements within the central space disappeared just below the
distal boundary of the basal body (Figures 6A, 6H).
The dorsal basal body (DB) and ventral basal body (VB)
anchored the dorsal flagellum (DF) and ventral flagellum
(VF), respectively. Both basal bodies were approximately

1.6 μm long, arranged in parallel to each other, and possessed nine transitional fibers extending from each triplet
towards the cell membrane (Figures 6A, 6H–I). Internal
cartwheel elements were present within the most proximal ends of both basal bodies (Figures 6J, 7G).
Flagellar Root System
The flagellar root system is described here from the proximal boundary of the basal bodies toward the distal
boundary of the basal bodies as viewed from the anterior
end of the cell (Figure 7). The DB and the VB were joined
with a connecting fiber and associated with three microtubular roots: the dorsal root (DR), the intermediate root
(IR) and the ventral root (VR) (Figures 7A–B). The VB, IR
and VR were also associated with three fibrous roots: the
right fiber (RF), the intermediate fiber (IF) and the left
fiber (LF) (Figure 7B). The DR and IR were associated with
two thin laminae: the dorsal lamina (DL) and the IR-associated lamina (IL), respectively (Figures 7A–D, 9B).

The DR originated from the dorsal side of the DB and consisted of three microtubules near the proximal boundary.
Both the DR and the DL extended toward the anterior side
of the cell (Figures 7B–D) and supported the flagellar
pocket (Figures 7E–F). The DR occupied the dorsal left
side of the flagellar pocket; the DL occupied the dorsal
right side of the flagellar pocket and extended from the VR
to the DR at the level of the transition zone (Figures 7E–
F). A row of linked microtubules (LMt) originated in close
association with the DL (above the VR) and supported the
right side of the flagellar pocket (Figures 7F, 7H). The DL
and LMt extended from the left side of the flagellar pocket
to the right side near the posterior boundary of the vestibulum (Figures 8A–E). The LMt supported the inner lining of the vestibulum, turned posteriorly along the curve
formed by the ventral opening (Figure 3E) and ultimately
became the sheet of microtubules located beneath the
plasma membrane of the entire cell (Figures 4A, 4C–D).
The IR was positioned between the two basal bodies, originated from the right dorsal side of the VB, and consisted

of four microtubules near the proximal boundary (Figures
7B–C, 7G). The left side of the IR was tightly associated
with the IL and two fibrous roots: the LF and the IF (Figure
7B). The LF extended laterally and was about 500 nm
long; the IF extended to the left ventral side of the cell and
was about 1.5 μm long (Figures 7B–C). The IL was associated with the left side of the IR along its entire length, and
the IR and IL became more closely associated as they
extended anteriorly along the left side of the flagellar
pocket (Figures 7I–K). The microtubules from the IR eventually merged with the left side of the LMt-DL and likely
contributed to the sheet of microtubules located beneath
the plasma membrane of the entire cell (Figures 8A–C).
The VR originated from the ventral side of the VB and consisted of nine microtubules that were closely associated
with the RF (Figures 7A, 7G). The RF extended toward the
right-ventral side of the cell and was about 1 μm long (Figures 7A–C). The microtubules from the VR supported the
right side of the flagellar pocket and joined the right side
of the LMt and the DL (Figures 7D–F, 7L). The microtubules from the VR ultimately became one of the elements
that reinforced the feeding apparatus (Figures 8, 9).
Feeding Apparatus
The feeding apparatus was positioned on the right side of
the flagellar pocket and is described here along the posterior to anterior axis. This apparatus consisted of four main
elements or spaces: a feeding pocket, a VR embedded
within six electron-dense fibers, a compact "oblique striated fiber" (OSF) and a "congregated globule structure"
(CGS) (Figures 8, 9C). The OSF was approximately 1.5
μm long, 800 nm wide and 500 nm high and was positioned between the feeding apparatus and the right side of
the flagellar pocket (Figures 8A, J). The CGS attached to
the anterior side of the OSF (Figures 8B–E, 8J). Six rows of
electron dense fibers, each containing a microtubule from
the VR, passed over the top of the OSF-CGS complex (Figures 8C–F, 8J–K). The VR and the six associated fibers
reinforced the anterior-right side of the feeding pocket
(Figures 8C–E). The left side of the feeding pocket was

reinforced by a striated fiber that extended from the left
side of the CGS (Figures 8E–F, 8K, 9C).
The feeding pocket was surrounded by an accumulation
of small vesicles and branched from the vestibulum
toward the ventral side of the cell before turning toward
the posterior end of the cell (Figures 8A–D, 9C). Serial
oblique sections through the feeding pocket did not demonstrate distinctive feeding vanes or rods per se; only the
VR microtubules within the electron dense fibers were
observed (Figure 8H). Nonetheless, the vestibular junction (or crest) between the flagellar pocket and the feeding
pocket contained a "tomentum" [20] of fine hairs (Figure
8I).
Molecular Phylogenetic Position as Inferred from SSU
rDNA
We determined the nearly complete sequence of the SSU
rRNA gene of C. aureus (2034 bp). Maximum likelihood
(ML) analyses of (i) a 38-taxon alignment including representative sequences from the major lineages of eukaryotes, robustly grouped the sequence from C. aureus with the
Euglenozoa (e.g. Euglena, Diplonema and Trypanosoma)
(Figure 10). In order to more comprehensively evaluate
the phylogenetic position of C. aureus within the Euglenozoa, we analyzed three additional datasets: (ii) a 35-taxon
alignment (Figure 11), (iii) a 29-taxon alignment (Additional file 1), and (iv) a 25-taxon alignment (Addtional

file 2) (see Methods for details).
Tree topologies of these three ML analyses were very similar (Figure 11, Additional Files 1, 2). Accordingly, the
results from the analyses of the 35-taxon dataset including
several short environmental sequences, was an accurate
representation of all three analyses (Figure 11). Euglenozoan sequences clustered into five major groups with high
statistical support: a kinetoplastid clade, a diplonemid
clade, a bacteriovorous euglenid clade (i.e. Notosolenus
and Petalomonas), a clade consisting of eukaryovorous and
photosynthetic euglenids, and a novel clade referred to
here as the "Symbiontida". The relationships among these
clades (i.e. the backbone) were not resolved (Figure 11).
Additional phylogenetic analyses using alternative outgroups (e.g., heteroloboseans) recovered the same basic
tree topology shown in Figure 11: (1) Calkinsia aureus is a
member of a distinct euglenozoan subclade consisting of
sequences derived from environmental PCR surveys, and
(2) this clade is not convincingly affiliated with any one
of the three known euglenozoan subgroups (euglenids,
kinetoplastids and diplonemids). Moreover, the sequence
from C. aureus occupied the deepest position within the
Symbiontida, which otherwise consisted of seven environmental sequences collected from Northern Europe
and South America (Figure 11).

Discussion
Several poorly studied flagellates, some with discoidalshaped mitochondrial cristae, have, at one time or
another, been suspected to be close relatives of euglenozoans (e.g. Stephanopogon, Hemimastix, Bordnamonas, Cryptaulax, Postgaardi and Calkinsia) [21-24]. The best
synapomophies for the Euglenozoa are (1) a tripartite
flagellar root system (DR, IR and VR), (2) heteromorphic

paraxonemal rods (i.e. a whorled structure in the DF and
three-dimensional lattice of parallel fibers in the VF), and
(3) tubular extrusomes [9]. The presence of these
ultrastructural features in very diverse lineages of flagellates, in combination with molecular phylogenetic data,
has established the identity and composition of the
Euglenozoa [7,9].

Calkinsia aureus was originally described as a member of
the Euglenida with light microscopical information [12],
and we demonstrate here that these flagellates possess all
three ultrastructural synapomorphies for the Euglenozoa.
Moreover, the permanently condensed chromatin, long
flagellar transition zone, longitudinal cell division and
long basal bodies are also features found in many other
euglenozoans [25]. These morphological data were concordant with our comparative analyses of SSU rDNA
showing that C. aureus is robustly embedded within the
Euglenozoa clade (Figures 10, 11). However, C. aureus
lacked traits that are specific to any of the three previously
recognized euglenozoan subgroups (e.g., kinetoplasts,
pellicle strips, or absence of paraxonemal rods). The
faintly striated pellicle originally attributed to C. aureus
using light microscopy is, in actuality, the longitudinally
arranged rod-shaped epibiotic bacteria [13,14]. The sheet
of microtubules beneath the plasma membrane in C.
aureus was continuous over the entire cell, like in kinetoplastids and diplonemids, rather than interrupted by periodic discontinuities like in euglenids [26-28] (Figure 3C).
There was also no clear evidence of a euglenid-like feeding
apparatus consisting of rods and vanes [20,26,29].
Accordingly, our study indicates that with present knowledge, C. aureus should not be considered a member of the
Euglenida or more specifically, a member of the Petalomonadidae as originally classified [12].
Absence of Mitochondria with Cristae

Aerobic kinetoplastids and euglenids possess well-developed discoid-shaped cristae within their mitochondria
[26], and diplonemids and Hemistasia possess a few flatshaped cristae within each mitochondrion [30-32]. By
contrast, both C. aureus and P. mariagerensis lack recognizable mitochondria with cristae, and instead, contain double-membrane bound organelles that are nearly identical

in morphology to the well-studied hydrogenosomes
described in other anoxic flagellates (e.g. Trichomonas)
[33]. Hydrogenosomes are the descendents of mitochondria and function to produce molecular hydrogen, acetate,
CO2 and ATP in anoxic environments [34,35]. A more
confident functional characterization of the mitochondrion-derived organelles in C. aureus or Postgaardi will
require biochemical and molecular biological assays.
A Novel Extracellular Matrix
The plasma membrane of C. aureus was reinforced with a
continuous sheet of microtubules and a double-layered
lamella, which was in turn subtended by a dense array of
mitochondrion-derived organelles (Figures 4, 5). This
overall organization, where mitochondrion-derived
organelles are located immediately beneath a sheet of surface microtubules, has also been observed in Postgaardi.
However, a uniform and perforated extracellular matrix
enveloped the cell surface of C. aureus, and so far as we
know, the organization of this cell covering is novel not
only among euglenozoans, but also among eukaryotes
(Figures 4, 5). Because both the epibiotic bacteria and the
host cell cytoplasm were colorless (Figures 1D, 1F–G), the
distinctively orange color of C. aureus is clearly attributable to the chemical composition of the extracellular
matrix (Figure 1G). Moreover, the even distribution of
tiny tubes within the matrix provide conduits between the
host plasma membrane and the epibiotic bacteria and
presumably facilitate metabolic exchanges necessary for
survival in low-oxygen environments. This interpretation
is consistent with knowledge of anoxic ciliates, which also
maintain an intimate physical relationship between mitochondrion-derived organelles (immediately beneath the
host plasma membrane) and epibiotic bacteria (immediately above the host plasma membrane) [36,37].

Flagellar Apparatus
The flagella of most euglenids and kinetoplastids have
non-tubular mastigonemes (or flagellar hairs) that,
among other functions, facilitate gliding motility [38];
however, these structures are absent in C. aureus, P. mariagerensis and diplonemids. Instead, a tomentum of fine
hairs are present at the crest of the feeding pocket in C.
aureus that are similar to those described in the pho-

totrophic euglenid Colacium [39], the phagotrophic euglenid Peranema [40], and the kinetoplastid Cryptobia
[41,42]. Although hairs associated with the feeding pocket
have not been routinely observed in other members of the
Euglenozoa, the presence of these hairs in distantly
related lineages indicate that this feature might represent
an ancestral state for the Euglenozoa as a whole.

transitional plates. Kinetoplastids and diplonemids possess distal and proximal transitional plates and a hollow

transition zone [30,32,42], while euglenids only possess
the proximal transitional plate. Although the transition
zone of most euglenids is also hollow, the transition zone

to be electron dense. However, the detailed structure of
these transition zones still remains to be characterized in
detail [29,43]. The central area of the transition zone in C.
aureus is also electron dense and contains a complex system of elements that have never been observed in any
other Euglenozoan so far (Figure 6). Characterization of
the flagellar transition zone in Postgaardi might demonstrate several homologous elements that would help to
further establish a close relationship between this lineage
and C. aureus.

Nonetheless, Diplonema ambulator, Rhynchopus euleeides,
R. coscinodiscivorus and C. aureus all have fibers that extend
from each microtubular doublet to the flagellar membrane; these fibers have been called "transitional fibers"
[30,32,44]. "Transitional fibers" has also been used to
describe fibers that extended from each microtubular triplet of a basal body to the flagellar membrane, which is
potentially confusing [45-47]. Nonetheless, the "radial
connectives" extending from the doublets in the transition zone of C. aureus are nearly identical, and likely
homologous, to the 'transitional fibers' extending from
the doublets in diplonemids, such as D. ambulator.

Feeding Apparatus
Each of the euglenozoan subgroups contains members
with an elaborate feeding apparatus [20,26,29,39]. Most
phagotrophic euglenids, for instance, have a distinctive
feeding apparatus consisting of 4–5 central vanes and 2–
3 supporting rods [28,48,49]. Some bacteriovorous euglenids (e.g. Petalomonas), however, possess a much simpler
feeding apparatus that is very similar to the MTR feeding
pockets found in many kinetoplastids (e.g. Bodo) [26].
The microtubules that support the rods in phagotrophic
euglenids and the MTR pockets in bacteriovorous
euglenozoans originate from the ventral root of the ventral basal body. Similarly, the feeding pocket in C. aureus
was also supported by microtubules that originated from
the ventral root and is almost certainly homologous to the
MTR pockets or rods found in other euglenozoans,
including Postgaardi [33]. Moreover, the compact
"oblique striated fiber" (OSF) that reinforces the feeding
pocket in C. aureus was similar to the amorphous matrix
found in some euglenid feeding rods and might represent
a vestige of a more elaborate ancestral state. However, this
inference will require improved understanding of the
morphological diversity and phylogeny of other euglenozoans that are more closely related to C. aureus.
A Novel Extrusomal Pocket
Although tubular extrusomes are not widespread within
the Euglenozoa, several members from each main subgroup possess them, such as the euglenid Entosiphon
[50,51]; the kinetoplastids Rhynchobodo [52], Hemistasia
[31], and Phylomitus [53]; the diplonemid Diplonema nigricans [54]; and Postgaardi mariagerensis [33]. Calkinsia
aureus not only had tubular extrusomes like the lineages
listed above, but they were clustered together much like
the single battery of tubular extrusomes found in Hemistasia [31]. By contrast, Postgaardi and Rhynchobodo possess
several smaller batteries of tubular extrusomes that are
dispersed throughout the cytoplasm [33,52].

The battery of tubular extrusomes in C. aureus was
anchored to a novel extrusomal pocket that branched off
of the vestibulum separately from the feeding apparatus
and the flagellar apparatus (Figures 3A, 3C, 9). This battery of extrusomes was often discharged as a single unit
from the extrusomal pocket and through the anterior
opening (Figure 1H). The functional significance of this
process is unclear.
The phagotrophic euglenid Dinema sulcatum also contains
a flagellar pocket and reportedly has two additional pockets: (1) a "normal" feeding apparatus consisting of supportive rods and vanes and (2) an "extra" pocket
consisting of MTR-like microtubules [43]. One previously
proposed hypothesis for the presence of two feeding pockets in D. sulcatum involves the following inferences: the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/16

"extra" pocket is a remnant of the MTR feeding pocket
present in the ancestral euglenozoan and the rod-andvane based feeding apparatus represents a duplicated, and
greatly embellished, MTR pocket that arose within a
derived lineage of phagotrophic euglenids [7,27,55]. This
hypothesis is consistent with comparative morphological
data that indicates other euglenid cytoskeletal components also evolved by duplication, such as the total
number of pellicle strips around the cell periphery
[7,28,56,57]. Nonetheless, the extrusomal pocket in C.
aureus was supported by the LMt (connected to the dorsal
root) rather than microtubules from the ventral root,
which support both MTR pockets and rod-and-vane based
feeding apparatuses in euglenozoans. Therefore, the extrusomal pocket in C. aureus appears to be novel and does
not seem to be homologous to any type of feeding apparatus reported so far (e.g. a rod-and-vane based apparatuses or a remnant or duplicated MTR pocket).
Euglenozoans with Epibiotic Bacteria
Postgaardi mariagerensis [33,58], Euglena helicoideus [59],
Dylakosoma pelophilum [60], C. aureus [13] and five unidentified euglenozoans from low oxygen environments
[13,14,61] have been reported to possess epibiotic bacteria on the cell surface. The epibiotic bacteria on D. pelophilum are spherical, and those on the other taxa are rodshaped and densely packed on the cell surface. Only one
of the five unidentified euglenozoans, namely "morphotype C" from Monterey Bay, was studied with both SEM
and TEM [61]. The rod-shape epibiotic bacteria on these
cells were not associated with a superficial distribution of
mitochondrion-derived organelles (e.g., hydrogenosomes) beneath the host plasma membrane. Nonetheless,
morphotype C was clearly a euglenid, because the flagella
contained paraxonemal rods, the feeding apparatus consisted of rods and vanes, and thin proteinaceous strips
supported the cell surface.

By contrast, the combination of ultrastructural features in
C. aureus and P. mariagerensis make these lineages difficult
to place within the Euglenozoa. Both lineages lack evidence of pellicle strips or kinetoplasts and possess paraxonemal rods, tubular extrusomes, mitochondrion-derived
organelles beneath the plasma membrane, and condensed chromatin. Detailed comparisons of the feeding
apparatus in C. aureus, P. mariagerensis, and other anoxic
euglenozoans should help better establish their phylogenetic relationships with each other; however, except for C.
aureus, this information is currently lacking for nearly all
of these lineages, including P. mariagerensis.
Molecular Phylogenetic Framework for Euglenozoans in
Low-Oxygen Environments
The morphology of C. aureus (e.g. the flagellar apparatus
and tubular extrusomes) was completely concordant with

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:16

the molecular phylogenetic data in so far as strongly placing C. aureus within the Euglenozoa, but not with any of
the three previously recognized subclades. Figure 11
shows the phylogenetic position of C. aureus within the
Euglenozoa, which consisted of five main clades.
Although Petalomonas and Notosolenus branched together
as a separate clade, morphological evidence strongly supports their inclusion within the Euglenida. Therefore, the
molecular phylogenetic data coupled with the morphological data allows us to recognize four clades of euglenozoans: the Euglenida, the Kinetoplastida, the
Diplonemida and a novel clade of anoxic euglenozoans,
hereby named the Symbiontida.
The Symbiontida includes several environmental
sequences that were originally designated either as
diplonemid sequences (e.g. T53F7) [62], as uncultured
euglenozoan sequences (e.g. M4 18E09, M4 18D10, FV23
2D3C4 and FV36 2E04) [63,64] or as "possible early
branching eukaryotes" (CAR_H25 and CAR_E220) [65].
Some of the environmental sequences within the Symbiontida were already suspected to represent either a novel
sister clade to the Euglenozoa or novel subclade of
euglenozoans [64]. Nonetheless, we have demonstrated
that the Symbiontida contains several more environmental sequences collected from different low-oxygen environments and also C. aureus, which provides an
organismal anchor (i.e. the cellular identity) for this clade.
We should also note that some environmental sequences
from mid-Atlantic hydrothermal vent environments in
the "Lost City", namely LC23 5EP 5, LC22 5EP 17, and
LC22 5EP 32, grouped strongly with the diplonemid clade
and not with the Symbiotida [66]. Moreover, the lack of
phylogenetic signal and perhaps also long-branch-attraction were the likely reasons for why the relatively fastevolving sequences from Notosolenus and Petalomonas did
not cluster strongly with the euglenid clade in our analyses of the dataset containing the shortest sequences (Figure 11). Our analysis of the dataset including only the
longest sequences, by contrast, clustered Notosolemus and
Petalomonas with all other euglenids, albeit without strong
statistical support (Additional File 2) [67,68].
The Symbiontida: A Novel Subclade of the Euglenozoa
Before C. aureus had been studied at the ultrastructural
and molecular phylogenetic levels, one author classified
this lineage with P. mariagerensis within the taxon "Postgaardea" on the basis of microaerophily [10,11].
Although our characterization of C. aureus has demonstrated epibiotic bacteria and mitochondrion-derived
organelles like those described in P. mariagerensis, the
presence of these characters in both lineages does not necessarily reflect homology. Independently derived physical
relationships between epibiotic bacteria and mitochon-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/16

drion-derived organelles have been found in many different lineages of anoxic microeukaryotes, such as ciliates,
oxymonads, parabasalids, heteroloboseans and euglenozoans [36,69]. Moreover, the presence of tubular extrusomes in both C. aureus and P. mariagerensis could be a
symplesiomorphic state inherited from a very distant
euglenozoan ancestor.
Nonetheless, our phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that
C. aureus is a member of a newly recognized clade of
anoxic euglenozoans consisting mainly of environmental
sequences. The absence of molecular phylogenetic data
and conclusive ultrastructural data from Postgaardi precludes us from determining whether this lineage is also a
member of the clade of microaerophiles. Until these data
are reported and the phylogenetic position of Postgaardi is
demonstrated more rigorously, we concur with a previous
taxonomic treatment for Postgaardi that recognizes this
lineage as incertae sedis within the Euglenozoa [3]. As
such, we conclude that it is premature to recognize the
taxon Postgaardea and view it as a synonym for P. mariagerensis.
In light of the previous discussion, we propose the name
"Symbiontida" for the clade of microaerobic or anaerobic
euglenozoans consisting of the most recent ancestor of C.
aureus that also possessed rod-shaped epibiotic bacteria,
reduced or absent mitochondrial cristae, tubular extrusomes and a nucleus with permanently condensed chromatin. This novel subclade of euglenozoans is recognized
on the basis of SSU rDNA-based phylogenetic data of lineages from several different low-oxygen environments.
Although the ultrastructural characteristics listed above
are expected to be present in most, if not all, members of
the Symbiontida (the ultrastructural and molecular phylogeny of another lineage in this clade will be published
shortly; Breglia, Yubuki, Hoppenrath and Leander, in
preparation), this remains to be demonstrated with
improved knowledge of euglenozoan diversity from both
ultrastructural and molecular phylogenetic perspectives.

Conclusion
Molecular phylogenies inferred from SSU rDNA demonstrate that C. aureus is closely related to several marine
environmental sequences collected from low-oxygen
environments, forming a novel subgroup within the
Euglenozoa, referred to here as the "Symbiontida".
Improved understanding of these flagellates is necessary
for further demonstrating the cellular identity of the Symbiontida and for reconstructing the evolutionary radiation
of the euglenozoan lineage. In this study, we characterized
the detailed ultrastructure of C. aureus and demonstrated
all of the euglenozoan synapomorphies (e.g. flagellar
apparatus) and several cellular innovations associated
with symbiotic interactions with epibiotic bacteria (e.g.,
complex extracellular matrix). We also demonstrated
novel ultrastructural systems found in this species, such as
the extrusomal pocket.
Environmental sequencing surveys from different lowoxygen environments around the world suggest that many
symbiontid lineages have yet to be discovered and characterized. Continued exploration into the overall diversity
of this group should contribute significantly to our understanding of eukaryotic evolution, especially in low-oxygen
environments.
