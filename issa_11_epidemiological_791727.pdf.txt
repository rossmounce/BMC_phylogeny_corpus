Abstract
Background: There is evidence that Candida colonization contributes to increasing invasion of candidiasis in
hospitalized neonates. Few studies investigated the epidemiology and risk factors of Candida colonization among
hospitalized and non-hospitalized infants. This prospective study investigated the major epidemiological
characteristics of Candida species colonizing oral and rectal sites of Jordanian infants.
Methods: Infants aged one year or less who were examined at the pediatrics outpatient clinic or hospitalized at
the Jordan University Hospital, Amman, Jordan, were included in this study. Culture swabs were collected from oral
and rectal sites and inoculated on Sabouraud dextrose agar. All Candida isolates were confirmed by the Remel
RapID yeast plus system, and further investigated for specific virulence factors and antifungal susceptibility MIC
using E-test. Genotyping of C. albicans isolates was determined using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)
analysis method.
Results: A total of 61/492 (12.4%) infants were colonized with Candida species by either their oral/rectal sites or
both. Rectal colonization was significantly more detected than oral colonization (64.6% verses 35.4%), particularly
among hospitalized infants aged more than one month. The pattern and rates of colonization were as follows: C.
albicans was the commonest species isolated from both sites and accounted for 67.1% of all isolates, followed by
C.kefyr (11.4%), each C. tropicalis and C. glabrata (8.9%) and C. parapsilosis (3.8%).
A various rates of Candida isolates proved to secrete putative virulence factors in vitro; asparatyl proteinase,
phospholipase and hemolysin. C. albicans were associated significantly (P < 0.05) with these enzymes than other
Candida species. All Candida isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B and caspofungin, whereas 97% of Candida
species isolates were susceptible to fluconazole using E-test.
The genetic similarity of 53 C. albicans isolates as demonstrated by dendrogram revealed the presence of 29
genotypes, and of these one genotype accounted for 22% of the isolates.
Conclusion: This study presents important epidemiological features of Candida colonization of Jordanian infants.
Keywords: Candida colonization, virulence, genotypes, antifungal susceptibility

Background
Candida colonization of infants is a risk factor for
developing candidiasis, especially in neonatal intensive
care unit (NICU) [1-4]. During the past decade colonization and candidaemia with non-albicans Candida species has risen dramatically with high rates of carriage in

hospitalized infants including neonates admitted to
NICU [2,5,6].
It is generally observed that most infant candidiasis is
thought to be endogenously acquired through prior
colonization of different parts of the body, while other
studies reported that certain outbreaks of Candida
infection were caused by nosocomial infection in neonatal intensive care units [7-10].
The potential pathogenesis of Candida species appears
to depend on many immunological and environmental

host factors and strain virulence factors, including
hyphae and biofilm formation, drug resistance and the
production of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes [11-15].
Phenotyping and genotyping of Candida isolates are
important features can be used to investigate the common genotypes and possible route of transmission and
infection within hospitals and community, especially
molecular typing of Candida isolates is highly useful
tool in detection source of nosocomial infections
[16-19]. This study was carried out to investigate the
major epidemiological characteristics of Candida colonizing hospitalized and non-hospitalized Jordanian
infants.

Methods
This prospective study was conducted at the Jordan
University Hospital over a period of 10-month; from
March 2008 to December 2008. The study has been
approved by the high graduate committees of the
Faculty of Medicine, and ethics committee of Jordan
Hospital University and Faculty of Graduate studies/
University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan. Verbal consent
was obtained from all mothers of infants after explaining
the purpose of the study.
Study participants

A total of 492 infants (aged one year or less) were
included in this study over a period of 10-month (20082009) as follows: Group 1; 265 neonates admitted to
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Group 2; 37 infants
admitted to pediatric ward (PW) due to urinary tract or
kidney problems. Group 3; 190 infants examined in
pediatric outpatients clinic. For each patient important
demographic characteristics were recorded on special
study form, and all hospitalized neonates and infants
were observed for developing candidaemia.
Specimen collection

Pre-wetted cotton swabs with sterile saline were used to
collect culture specimens from oral and rectal sites of
each infant. For neonates in the NICU; oral and rectal
swabs were collected within 24 hr of birth, day seven
and after every one week until the baby discharged or
died. Fresh oral and rectal specimens were handled and
inoculated directly on Sabouraud dextrose agar plates
(SDA, Oxoid, Ltd, Basingstoke, UK) which supplemented with chloramphenicol (0.05 g/l) and incubated at 37°
C for 24-48 hrs.

growth was identified by detection of various color characteristics on CHROMagar Candida plates [20]. All Candida species isolates were confirmed by the Remel
RapID yeast plus system (Remel Inc, Lenexa, KS). Reference standard strains of C. albicans (ATCC 90028), C.
glabrata (ATCC 22553) and C. parapsilosis (ATCC
22019) were subcultured on the same medium as
controls.
Detection of extracellular production of aspartyl proteinases was made for all Candida isolates by demonstration and measurement of the clear zone of
proteolysis around Candida colony growth in bovine
serum albumin agar [20]. Production of extracellular
phospholipaes activity was estimated by growing Candida on egg-yolk agar and observing the precipitation
zone around the Candida colony growth [12]. Betahemolysin production was evaluated using a fresh
human blood agar plate and after incubation for 48 hr
[20]. Reference strains of C. albicans (ATCC 10231)
served as positive control for proteinase and phospholipaes assays and C. albicans (ATCC 90028) served as
positive control for haemolysin assay.
Antifungal susceptibility test

Etests were performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (AB Biodisk, Sweden). The antifungal agents
used were amphotericin B, fluconazole and caspofungin.
A quality control C. albicans strain (ATCC 90028) was
included.
Genotyping

Determination of Candida genotype was performed
using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis method and PCR amplification with three random
oligonucleotides single primers T3B primer 5’-d(AGG
TCG CGG GTT CGA ATCC) 3’ [21]. RSD 10 primer
5’-d(CCG CAG CCA)-3’ and RSD 12 primer 5’-d(GGT
CCG TGT TTC AAG ACG)-3’ [22].
Statistical analysis

All Data analysis were performed using the computerized statistical program Statistical Package of Social
Science program (SPSS, version 16, USA) and was used
to determine the P values and investigated phylogenetic
tree (dendrogram) showing the genetic relatedness
among the isolates which was constructed based on
genetic similarities. In all statistical tests, the differences
were considered to be statistically significant if p-value
(< 0.05).

Mycological investigations

All growth of yeast-like colonies was subsequently identified by subculture 2-3 representative colonies on a
CHROMagar Candida medium (Oxoid, Ltd, Basingstoke,
UK) and incubated at 37°C for 24-48 hr. Candida

* One hospitalized neonate was his oral and rectal sites colonized
with C. albicans has developed Candidemia

Candida colonization was recorded in 12.4% of all
infants, and rectal site was significantly more colonized
than oral site (64.6% vs 35.4%; P < 0.05). Candida colonization was significantly more prevalent among hospitalized infants aged ≥ 30 days than neonates admitted to
NICU (15.3% vs 10.6%). Despite this fact only one case
of candidaemia has been detected to be associated with
Candida colonization in a hospitalized neonate over the
10-month study period (Table 1). The study also
demonstrated that age, gender, the duration of hospitalization, previous antibiotic treatment of infants were not
a significant risk factor associated with Candida colonization (Table 1). C. albicans was the commonest species
(67.1%) isolated from both oral and rectal sites of
infants, whereas other non-albicans Candida species
accounted for one third of isolates (Table 2). It is difficult to correlate the results of this study with most
other studies which have been investigated mainly the
relationship between risk factors of Candida colonization and developing of Candida infections in neonates
hospitalized in NICU [1,3-5,9]. However, a study in
Greece has found that Candida species colonization was
detected in 12.1% of neonates during a 12-month period, and C. albicans was isolated from 42% of colonized
neonates. In addition, candidemias were diagnosed more
in colonized neonates (6.9%) as compared with 0.76% of
noncolonized neonates (P = 0.002)[3]. A recent study

same time.
** Significant (P < 0.05)

from Brazil reported that 19% of the neonates were
colonized by Candida species which were divided
equally between C. albicans (50%) and non-albicans
Candida (50%) [1]. The increased colonization of nonalbicans Candida species as well as their cause of candidaemia in neonates and adult Jordanian patients has
been shown to be similar to other studies from various
countries [1,2,6,4,7,23].
All Candida isolates in this study were 100% susceptible to amphotericin B and caspofungin, while susceptibility to fluconazole was observed only in 5/7 C.
glabrata isolates (Table 3). These results are similar to
some extent to a previous study published from Jordan
[23].
The present study has detected a significant production of putative virulence enzymes of phospholipase,
protease in most C. albicans isolates from oral and rectal specimens, compared to production of these enzymes
among non-albicans Candida species (Table 4). The
expression of hemolysin activity was also significant
among the majority of C. albicans, C. tropicals, C. glabrata compared to other Candida isolates. However, no
significant relationship has been detected between

Candida isolates from oral or rectal specimens and
exertion of these enzymes or in relation to their antifungal susceptibility. Many studies have suggested that
hemolytic activity and hydrolytic enzymes are putative
virulence factor contributing to Candida colonization
and hematogeneous infection [12,14,15,20,24]. A recent
study has shown that the increased pathogenicity of
Candida drug-resistant strains for systemic infection
was associated with a number of biochemical and physiological changes, including cellular alterations in cell
wall polysaccharides, rapid and extensive hypha and biofilm formation [25].

The results of RAPD patterns of C. albicans isolates as
demonstrated in constructed dendrogram suggest that at
least one genotype was prevalent (22.6%) among all
colonized infants either hospitalized or not (Figure 1,2
&3). It has been proved tha RAPD is a very useful
method for evaluating and comparing the genetic profiles of C. albicans clones [22].

Conclusion
This study contributes to increase our understanding of
the epidemiology of Candida colonization in neonates
and infants whether hospitalized or not.
