Abstract
Background: While wild chimpanzees are experiencing drastic population declines, their numbers at African rescue
and rehabilitation projects are growing rapidly. Chimpanzees follow complex routes to these refuges; and their
geographic origins are often unclear. Identifying areas where hunting occurs can help law enforcement authorities
focus scarce resources for wildlife protection planning. Efficiently focusing these resources is particularly important
in Cameroon because this country is a key transportation waypoint for international wildlife crime syndicates.
Furthermore, Cameroon is home to two chimpanzee subspecies, which makes ascertaining the origins of these
chimpanzees important for reintroduction planning and for scientific investigations involving these chimpanzees.
Results: We estimated geographic origins of 46 chimpanzees from the Limbe Wildlife Centre (LWC) in Cameroon.
Using Bayesian approximation methods, we determined their origins using mtDNA sequences and microsatellite
(STRP) genotypes compared to a spatial map of georeferenced chimpanzee samples from 10 locations spanning
Cameroon and Nigeria. The LWC chimpanzees come from multiple regions of Cameroon or forested areas
straddling the Cameroon-Nigeria border. The LWC chimpanzees were partitioned further as originating from one of
three biogeographically important zones occurring in Cameroon, but we were unable to refine these origin
estimates to more specific areas within these three zones.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that chimpanzee hunting is widespread across Cameroon. Live animal smuggling
appears to occur locally within Cameroon, despite the existence of local wildlife cartels that operate internationally.
This pattern varies from the illegal wildlife trade patterns observed in other commercially valuable species, such as
elephants, where specific populations are targeted for exploitation. A broader sample of rescued chimpanzees
compared against a more comprehensive grid of georeferenced samples may reveal ‘hotspots’ of chimpanzee
hunting and live animal transport routes in Cameroon. These results illustrate also that clarifying the origins of refuge
chimpanzees is an important tool for designing reintroduction programs. Finally, chimpanzees at refuges are
frequently used in scientific investigations, such as studies investigating the history of zoonotic diseases. Our results
provide important new information for interpreting these studies within a precise geographical framework.

Background
Chimpanzee populations across western Africa have
decreased in number by more than 75% in the last 30
years [1]; and their rate of decline is accelerating [2].
There are many reasons for this decline including the
bushmeat trade [3], widespread forest clearance along

with habitat alteration [1] and the spread of infectious
diseases [4-6]. Capturing and smuggling live animals
further exacerbates this decline [7,8]. Insufficient data
and a lack of knowledge about how illegal activities
directly affect chimpanzee populations impedes understanding the impact of illegal hunting on the long term
survival of this species [8].
African wildlife rescue and rehabilitation projects
(’refuges’) have experienced a marked increase in their
numbers of resident chimpanzees in the last decade

[7,9]. Chimpanzees often arrive at these refuges through
circuitous routes, and their geographic origins are frequently unknown [7,10]. Ascertaining the geographic
origins of such chimpanzees can provide law enforcement officials with valuable insights on local patterns of
wildlife hunting and smuggling [10]. For example, geographic origin estimates from large seizures of elephant
ivory have provided important insights on patterns of
illegal elephant harvesting and international ivory smuggling [11-13]. Some observers have suggested that trade
in elephant ivory follows an ‘opportunistic take’ model
where dealers use a decentralized plan of procuring
ivory stocks to ship internationally as they become available across Africa [8]. Recent evidence suggests, however, that illegal trade in African elephant ivory may be
attributed to organized crime syndicates targeting specific elephant populations for intense exploitation [12,13].
Similar to elephant exploitation, ape hunting has been
proposed to follow an ‘opportunistic take’ model in
which chimpanzees are taken by commercial hunters in
the process of hunting many other species in their local
areas [7,14]. However, hunters appear to be increasingly
targeting apes as automatic weapons, shotguns and
ammunition have become more readily available in local
markets [1]. This shift towards organization and centralization in the ape trade is unsurprising as merchants
can charge up to $20,000 for a live chimpanzee on the
international black market [15] and roughly $100 on the
local black market in Cameroon [16]. Therefore, it may
be reasonable to consider the possibility that, like elephants, specific chimpanzee populations may also be
targeted for intense exploitation by organized wildlife
criminals. Determining the origins of rescued chimpanzees may indicate whether this pattern of targeted
exploitation is shared between these two species.
The Limbe Wildlife Centre (LWC) is one of three ape
rescue and rehabilitation projects that house chimpanzees in Cameroon. This refuge is home to 53 chimpanzees rescued by wildlife law enforcement officials in
Cameroon as of December 2009. Until now, the geographic origins of the LWC chimpanzees have been
enigmatic. Tracking the geographic origins of these
chimpanzees, particularly in Cameroon, is important for
two reasons. First, international wildlife crime syndicates
use Cameroon as a waypoint for smuggling a variety of
wildlife and wildlife-derived products (e.g., elephant
ivory [12], live parrots [17] and live chimpanzees
[18,19]). These illegal activities suggest that chimpanzees
at the LWC may come from other countries which may
complicate jurisdiction over these animals and make it
difficult to enforce Cameroonian laws that prohibit
hunting, capturing or selling chimpanzees and gorillas
[20]. Alternatively, the LWC chimpanzees could originate in Cameroon from specific populations targeted for

Page 2 of 15

exploitation, as there are large local networks of hunters
operating in Cameroon that target specific animal
groups [21]. Therefore, illuminating where chimpanzees
are procured and how they are transported could provide valuable information to Cameroonian authorities.
Second, Cameroon is home to two chimpanzee subspecies (Figure 1a), Pan troglodytes ellioti [22] (known
until recently as P. t. vellerosus [23]) and P. t. troglodytes
[1,24,25], although the taxonomy of chimpanzee subspecies is debated [26,27]. The ranges of these two subspecies converge at the Sanaga River in central Cameroon,
which acts as a barrier to their dispersal; despite this,
some limited gene flow between the two subspecies
occurs around the confluence of the Sanaga River and
its main tributary, the Mbam River [28,29]. Reintroduction programs are being developed for these chimpanzees and must take into account the genetic histories of
their chimpanzees in order to be most effective [30].
The rich and complex biogeographic history of chimpanzees in Cameroon make evaluating the actual location of these reintroductions important towards
maintaining evolutionary significant units of this species
[7,9,30]. In particular, P. t. ellioti has a very restricted
range, occurring only in Nigeria and western Cameroon
[1]; and 6,000-10,000 are believed to persist in the wild
[31].
We addressed three questions in this study. First, are
the LWC chimpanzees from Cameroon? Second, if so,
do their origins correspond to biogeographic boundaries
for this species in Cameroon? Finally, do these data suggest that hunting is widespread; and/or do hunting ‘hotspots’ exist in Cameroon where focused law
enforcement is needed? We addressed these questions
by estimating the geographic origins of 46 chimpanzees
housed at the LWC using Bayesian approximation
approaches [11]. We compared microsatellite (STRP)
loci genotype profiles and mtDNA sequence data against
a spatial map of allele frequencies constructed from
orthologus genotypes from georeferenced chimpanzee
DNA samples from ten locations spanning Cameroon
and Nigeria (Figure 1b). The LWC chimpanzees were
estimated to be from one of three biogeographically
important zones within Cameroon (or adjacent parts of
Nigeria). The majority of them were estimated to originate within the range of P. t. ellioti, but several were
also estimated to originate within the range of P. t. troglodytes. Their estimated origins are dispersed across
the country, suggesting that hunting is widespread
across Cameroon. Although our current sample size of
rescued chimpanzees is relatively small, these data suggest that, unlike patterns of organized elephant hunting,
chimpanzee hunting in Cameroon may follow an
‘opportunistic take’ model. More data from a broader
sample of rescued chimpanzees should be compared

Figure 1 Chimpanzee subspecies and georeferenced DNA sampling distributions. A) Distribution of chimpanzee subspecies.
Chimpanzees belong to a single species (Pan troglodytes) that is divided into four subspecies [1]. Phylogenetic analyses of mtDNA suggest that
these subspecies are divided into two geographically and genetically defined groups that split about 0.5 mya: a western African group (P. t.
verus and P. t. ellioti [22] [known until recently as P. t. vellerosus [23]) and a central/eastern African group (P. t. troglodytes and P. t. schweinfurthii)
[24]. A phylogeographic break between these two groups occurs at the Sanaga River in central Cameroon, separating populations of P. t. ellioti
north of the river from P. t. troglodytes south of the river. However, the Sanaga does not stop dispersal between subspecies completely because
some gene flow between them occurs near the confluence of the Sanaga and its main tributary, the Mbam River [24,28]. B) Map of Cameroon
and Nigeria showing collection sites of georeferenced chimpanzee DNA samples. Sampling sites shown on the map are: Ise Forest Reserve

Results and Discussion
STRP genotype profile dataset

A total of 185 chimpanzee DNA samples were typed at
ten autosomal STRP loci for this study. Forty-six of
these samples were from LWC chimpanzees, whereas
139 were from georeferenced chimpanzee DNA samples
from Cameroon and Nigeria. We considered an STRP
profile suitable for analysis if it included six or more
loci. A total of 88% of the 185 samples had suitable
STRP profiles and were included in all assignment tests,
but the vast majority of these samples had reliable allele
scores for at least eight loci. In total, all 46 LWC chimpanzee STRP profiles were used in the assignment tests,
whereas 86 STRP profiles from georeferenced chimpanzee DNA samples from ten locations across the study
area (Figure 1b) were used in all our assignment tests.
STRP allele sizes for samples included in this study are
listed in Additional File 1.
mtDNA haplotype analysis

Sequences of the first hypervariable region (HVRI) of
mtDNA were newly generated for each of the 46 LWC
chimpanzees and aligned against a georeferenced dataset
composed of 464 HVRI sequences from 28 locations

across Nigeria and Cameroon from previous studies
[23,24,32-34] that are publically available on DDBJ/
EMBL/GenBank International Nucleotide Sequence
Database. The median joining network shown in Figure
2 was partitioned into two major haplotypes. Haplotype
1 was composed of georeferenced chimpanzee samples
within the range of P. t. ellioti from Nigeria and western
Cameroon north of the Sanaga River (including those
from the transition zone in central Cameroon), with a
single exception. Haplotype 1 was subdivided into two
subsets. Haplotype 1a was composed of georeferenced
samples from western Nigeria, whereas Haplotype 1b
was composed of georeferenced chimpanzee samples
from eastern Nigeria and western Cameroon. Thirty-two
of the LWC chimpanzees clustered into Haplotype 1b.
Haplotype 2 was composed mostly of georeferenced
samples that were collected in southern Cameroon
south of the Sanaga River within the range of P. t. troglodytes. Haplotype 2 was further subdivided into three
subsets: Haplotypes 2a, 2b and 2c. These haplotypes
were composed mostly of samples collected at the same,
or nearby, sampling locations in southern Cameroon.
Fourteen of the LWC chimpanzees clustered within
Haplotype 2, of which four, one and nine clustered into
Haplotypes 2a, 2b and 2c, respectively. These mtDNA
haplotype designations (1a, 1b, 2a, 2b and 2c) were
encoded as an eleventh locus in each assignment test

for all the LWC chimpanzees and the 86 georeferenced
chimpanzee STRP profiles.
SAM assignment tests

We performed assignment tests for each individual using
smoothed and continuous assignment methods [11],
implemented in the SCAT software program http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/software.html. SCAT uses allele
frequencies from georeferenced samples combined with
spatial smoothing methods to generate a geographic map
of allele frequency variation. The smoothed assignment
method (SAM) combines smoothed reference maps of
allele frequency variation and an MCMC algorithm to
generate a posterior distribution of the probability that
samples of unknown origin share ancestry with samples
of known origin from the allele frequency variation map
of georeferenced samples [11].
We first explored the reliability of the SAM at accurately estimating the origins of our georeferenced samples by a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure in
which each sample in turn was treated as the sample
whose location was unknown, whereas the other samples were assumed to have known location. Results of
the cross-validation tests are given in Table 1. We
assessed the reliability of the SAM in two ways. First,
we assessed how accurately the SAM assigned georeferenced samples to their region of origin (i.e., from a location that is either north or south of the Sanaga River).
The SAM accurately placed individuals as originating
north versus south of the Sanaga River in 89% of assignments. Half of the samples that were not placed back to
their actual region of origin came from MANB, a location lying in the transition zone where limited gene flow
appears to occur between the two subspecies of chimpanzees in central Cameroon. Second, we assessed how

reliably the SAM assigned georeferenced samples to
their location of origin. The SAM accurately estimated
sampling location origin in 58% of assignments. Some
locations [e.g., Mount Cameroon (MTCM), Ise Forest
Reserve (ISFR), and to a lesser extent, areas in and near
the Cameroon Highlands (CRNP, AKZN and GGNP)]
had a much higher proportion of samples correctly estimated back to their true locations, suggesting that chimpanzees at these locations were genetically somewhat
distinct from those at other locations we sampled. Many
of the samples with incorrect SAM assignments had
estimated origins at locations very close to their actual
sampling location. Nearly all samples with incorrect
SAM assignments were estimated to have come from
locations within the same geographic zone (i.e., north of
the Sanaga, the transition zone or south of the Sanaga).
Given the results of the SAM reliability tests, we concluded that the SAM should be very accurate for estimating whether the LWC samples originated from
either the region north and west of the Sanaga River or
from the region south of the Sanaga River. Furthermore,
we expected the SAM to produce less reliable results
when estimating origins within those two regions given
the mixed performance of the SAM at accurately placing
the georeferenced samples to their correct locations
within these two regions. Finally, these results suggest
that there is substantial population structure separating
populations north and south of the Sanaga River, but
less population structure between populations within
these regions, as expected based on previous studies
[29].
We used the SAM to estimate an origin of each LWC
chimpanzee. These point estimates were determined by
the highest log-likelihood ratios of the posterior

Sanaga River. Samples shown in orange were collected in southern Cameroon south of the Sanaga River.

distribution that each sample originated from a particular location across five independent runs for a total of
10,000 iterations for each sample. Summaries of these
assignments are given in the last column of Table 1,
whereas details regarding SAM assignments for each
LWC chimpanzee are given in Table 2. Forty-two of the
LWC samples were consistently assigned the same estimated origin across independent runs. Only four of the
LWC chimpanzees had SAM location estimates that
varied across runs; however, the discrepancies between
the SAM estimated origins of those four samples were
from sampling locations that lie relatively close to each
other and in the same regional partition. Table 2 shows
the majority consensus for these SAM origins across
independent runs. The SAM assignment estimates
revealed that 35 of the LWC chimpanzees originated
from north of the Sanaga River, whereas 11 originated
from south of the Sanaga River. Interestingly, a high
proportion of LWC chimpanzees were estimated to have
come from Mount Cameroon (MTCM) and Gashaka
Gumti National Park (GGNP). MTCM and GGNP are
two locations where the SAM reliability tests accurately
estimated the sampling location origins of the georeferenced samples most frequently.
CAM assignment tests

We also performed assignments using a continuous
assignment method (CAM). The CAM is a considerable
improvement over traditional assignment tests in that
estimated origins are independent of sampling locations
included in the study. In particular, the CAM returns
point estimates of geographical coordinates for each
unknown sample that can be from anywhere within a

specified geographic boundary [11]. In this case, we
allowed the CAM to estimate an origin anywhere within
suitable chimpanzee habitat across the study area. We
assessed the reliability of the CAM by calculating the
median values of 10,000 coordinate point estimates for
each georeferenced sample from five independent CAM
runs with a leave-one-out cross-validation check. Then
we estimated the accuracy of these estimates in two
ways. First, we plotted 100 coordinates that were drawn
randomly from the set of all possible locations across
the full 10,000 CAM estimates for each georeferenced
sample. Tighter clustering of points indicates higher
confidence in the median point coordinate estimates,
whereas increased point dispersion indicates lower confidence in a given georeferenced chimpanzee sample’s
estimated CAM origin. We generally observed more
geographically concentrated clusters of point coordinate
estimates in chimpanzees originating from north of the
Sanaga River, as opposed to those from south of the
Sanaga River or from the transition zone. Examples of
the patterns observed in these plots are shown in Figure
3.
Second, we calculated the straight line distances
between the estimated CAM origin of each georeferenced sample and the sample’s actual location coordinates. This CAM reliability test showed that 30%, 50%
and 80% of the georeferenced samples could be accurately placed within 93 km, 157 km and 254 km of their
actual sampling location of origin, respectively. Furthermore, there are three zones in Cameroon that correspond to different ‘pockets’ of diversity observed from
patterns in the georeferenced samples discussed in

Figure 3 Representation of confidence in CAM assignments for georeferenced chimpanzee samples. The green circles represent 100
point estimates drawn randomly from the set of all possible locations weighted according to their probability. Stars represent the median point
coordinate estimate for each georeferenced sample. The concentration of these 100 circles in any given area is a guide to the probability that
the sample arose from that area, where tighter concentrations of circles indicate higher confidence in the median point estimate. The top panel
shows a georeferenced sample (ISFR001) with estimated CAM origins near its actual location of origin, along with a high concentration of circles
near its location origin. The bottom panel shows a georeferenced sample with estimated CAM origins also near its actual sampling location
(MANB014), but with more dispersed coordinate point estimates.

previous studies [24]: 1) north and west of the Sanaga
River, 2) south of the Sanaga in southern Cameroon and
3) a transition zone around the confluence of the Sanaga
and Mbam Rivers that is not well understood. We partitioned all straight line distance estimates into these
three biogeographically important zones. Based on these
criteria, 85% of the georeferenced samples had straight
line distances between their actual origin and their estimated origin that occurred completely within the zone
where the samples originated. The vast majority of georeferenced samples placed in the wrong zone had estimated origins in the transition zone. Based on these
observations, we concluded that the CAM should be
very accurate for estimating whether the LWC chimpanzees originated north of the Sanaga River, south of the
Sanaga River and, possibly, from the transition zone.
However, we expected that the CAM would produce
less reliable point estimates at a more fine-grained geographic scale.
A plot of median coordinate point estimates for each
LWC chimpanzee is shown in Figure 4 and are also
listed in Table 2 in decimal degrees. All of the LWC
chimpanzees have estimated origins in Cameroon, with

Page 8 of 15

the exception of one that may originate from near the
Mambilla Plateau that straddles the Cameroon-Nigeria
border. We further partitioned the LWC chimpanzees’
estimated CAM origins into the three biogeographically
important zones across the region. Samples shown in
Figure 4 were also color-coded according to their
mtDNA haplotype membership as determined by the
median-joining network analysis (Figure 2). Samples
shown in purple clustered with georeferenced samples
from north and west of the Sanaga River (Haplotype
1b), whereas samples colored orange clustered with
samples mostly from southern Cameroon south of the
Sanaga River (Haplotypes 2a, 2b and 2c). Samples with
estimated CAM origins in the transition zone in central
Cameroon consisted of both mtDNA haplotypes (i.e.,
purple and orange circles). These findings support previous georeferenced population genetic data suggesting
that some introgression occurs between P. t. ellioti and
P. t. troglodytes around the confluence of the Mbam and
Sanaga Rivers [24,28]. The mtDNA haplotype analysis
was consistent with CAM assignments in 87% of the
tests in placing the LWC chimpanzees as occurring
either north or south of the Sanaga.

Ghobrial et al. BMC Ecology 2010, 10:2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/10/2

Ten LWC chimpanzees that had mtDNA Haplotype 2
were also assigned origins south of the Sanaga. Thirtyone LWC chimpanzees that had mtDNA Haplotype 1b
had also CAM estimated origins north of the Sanaga.
One LWC chimpanzee (LWC039) had an estimated
CAM origin north of the Sanaga but also belonged to
mtDNA Haplotype 2c. LWC039 was rescued near Bertoua, Cameroon (N 4.5753 E 13.6847), which lies near
where the Lom and Pangar Rivers merge to form the
Sanaga River in eastern Cameroon. Analyses of an additional 27 STRP loci of LWC039 compared to chimpanzees representing each subspecies indicated that this
chimpanzee shares significant ancestry with both P. t.
ellioti and P. t. troglodytes (Gonder, Ghobrial and Locatelli, unpublished results). Based on this information, we
suspect that adding more STRP loci to the CAM tests
will eventually place LWC039 inside the transition zone.
The remaining four LWC chimpanzees have CAM estimated origins in the transition zone. We also examined
how much confidence we could place in each estimated
origin by plotting 100 coordinates that were drawn randomly from the set of all possible locations across the
full 10,000 CAM estimates for each LWC chimpanzee,
with the degree of spread indicating how much confidence to give to any one CAM estimated origin. Examples of these plots are shown in Figure 5. Generally, we
observed tighter clustering of points in samples from
western Cameroon than in those estimated to be from
the transition zone or southern Cameroon. Moreover,
we did not observe any greater dispersion of points in
the LWC samples compared to our confidence plots for
the georeferenced dataset.
These observations suggest that the LWC chimpanzees come from many areas across Cameroon, but the
majority appear to have come from within the range of
P. t. ellioti. We also calculated straight line distances
between each estimated origin and the nearest protected
area. These calculations revealed that 24 of the LWC
chimpanzees had estimated origins either inside or < 75
km from a protected area. These findings suggest that
chimpanzee hunting is relatively widespread across
Cameroon and occurs in both protected and unprotected areas. In addition, live animal transport appears
to occur locally within Cameroon.
CAM estimated origins in southern Cameroon

One limitation of the CAM is that this method requires
that a boundary be specified of allowable locations
across a continuous region. In other words, all samples
of unknown origin are assumed to have originated
within the specified boundary, which can be problematic
if reference samples are unavailable for a portion of a
species’ range. For our first CAM assignments, we specified a boundary that included Nigeria and Cameroon,
the range of our georeferenced samples. We had more

Page 9 of 15

confidence in the results for the LWC chimpanzees we
estimated to belong to P. t. ellioti for three reasons.
First, we included reference samples that covered the
complete range of P. t. ellioti. Second, all LWC chimpanzees that belonged to mtDNA Haplotype 1b, a haplotype used to identify P. t. ellioti in other studies
[32-35], also had CAM origins from north of the Sanaga
in the range of P. t. ellioti or the transition zone. Third,
the LWC and georeferenced chimpanzee samples estimated to originate north of the Sanaga River were more
tightly clustered in the coordinate plots compared to
those from southern Cameroon, suggesting higher confidence in those assignments. However, our reference
samples for P. t. troglodytes come only from southern
Cameroon, which is only a small portion of the range of
that subspecies. Due to this small reference sample, we
explored how likely it was that the LWC chimpanzees
with estimated origins from southern Cameroon might
have come from somewhere outside southern Cameroon
but within the larger range of P. t. troglodytes.
We created a second boundary file that included the
complete range of P. t. troglodytes across central Africa
and a data file containing only georeferenced data from
southern Cameroon. In this new CAM test, we used
georeferenced samples from western Nigeria as negative
controls for the new boundary file, since we knew their
origin to be outside the range of P. t. troglodytes. We
also challenged this CAM test to estimate the origins of
LWC chimpanzees originally placed in southern Cameroon by the Cameroon-Nigeria bounded CAM tests;
except in this test these LWC samples were allowed to
originate anywhere within the range of P. t. troglodytes.
We plotted 100 coordinates that were drawn randomly
from the set of all possible locations across 2,000 CAM
coordinate point estimates for each sample included in
this test. We expected the point estimate coordinate
plots for the georeferenced samples from western
Nigeria to be more dispersed across the area than the
plots for samples that were more likely to have originated within the specified boundary (i.e., those with estimated origins in southern Cameroon).
Point estimate coordinate plots for the georeferenced
samples from western Nigeria were very dispersed
across the entire boundary specified for the CAM. The
plots for the LWC chimpanzees generally showed more
clustering in southern Cameroon as opposed to other
areas in the range of P. t. troglodytes. T-test comparisons revealed that the LWC samples had significantly
more coordinate point estimates in southern Cameroon
(p < 0.01) than in other parts of the range of P. t. troglodytes compared to the control samples from western
Nigeria. These observations suggest that it is more likely
that the LWC chimpanzees estimated to be from southern Cameroon by the original CAM tests are indeed

confidence in the median point estimate. The top panel shows LWC026 with a tight concentration of circles near its median point estimate. The

more likely to be from southern Cameroon than other
regions within the range of P. t. troglodytes. However,
some degree of uncertainty regarding the origins of
these ten LWC chimpanzees is warranted.

Conclusions
In this study, we demonstrate that the LWC chimpanzees originate in Cameroon or contiguous forests along
the Cameroon-Nigeria border. Second, we have considerable power using both SAM and CAM tests to assign
each LWC chimpanzee to one of three biogeographically
important zones in Cameroon: north of the Sanaga
River, south of the Sanaga River or from the transition
zone in central Cameroon. The SAM and CAM
appeared to have less power for estimating origins on a
finer geographic scale within these biogeographically
important zones. Intriguingly, these data provide additional support for the hypothesis that introgression
between P. t. ellioti and P. t. troglodytes occurs around
the confluence of the Mbam and Sanaga Rivers in central Cameroon [24,28]. We are conducting extensive
population genetic studies of chimpanzees from this
region to verify these observations in a larger, fully georeferenced data set.
The CAM estimated origins indicate that the majority
of the LWC chimpanzees appear to have come from
western Cameroon within the range of P. t. ellioti (n =
32) or from the transition zone (n = 4), which is unsurprising as the wildlife protection authorities based at the
LWC focus their rescue and seizure efforts in that area
of Cameroon. Ten LWC chimpanzees are likely to come
from southern Cameroon within the range of P. t. troglodytes. Although we have limited power with this sample to make very firm conclusions, these data are
suggestive of trends in patterns of chimpanzee hunting
and live animal smuggling in Cameroon. Chimpanzee
hunting and live animal transport largely appears to
occur locally within Cameroon, despite the existence of
well organized wildlife crime cartels in the country that
operate internationally [8,13]. That is, we did not find
evidence to suggest that chimpanzees are being transported over large distances, involving movement over
national borders prior to their residence at refuges (with
the exception of potential border-crossing between
Cameroon and Nigeria). Both assignment test methods
reveal also that the LWC chimpanzees come from many
areas across Cameroon and near the Cameroon-Nigeria
border. These observations indicate that chimpanzee
hunting is widespread in Cameroon. In addition, the
CAM assignments suggest that LWC chimpanzees come
from both protected and unprotected areas of Cameroon suggesting that local legal protection across the
country needs to be reinforced. Given that 10 chimpanzees may be killed for each chimpanzee that survives in

Page 11 of 15

a sanctuary [1], this evidence of widespread hunting
underestimates the full extent of chimpanzee exploitation in Cameroon.
These observations make it difficult to pinpoint chimpanzee hunting ‘hotspots’, if they exist, given our current sample. It is possible that chimpanzee hunting
‘hotspots’ may not exist in Cameroon because these animals are taken when it is advantageous for the hunter
as in the ‘opportunistic take’ model. However, the fact
that we did not observe chimpanzee hunting ‘hotspots’
in Cameroon may be attributable to two factors. First,
the LWC sample was relatively small making it difficult
to pinpoint potential hunting ‘hotspots’ if they do exist.
Plans are underway to include chimpanzees from other
refuges in similar studies in the near future to search
for more specific trends in chimpanzee hunting in
Cameroon from a larger sample. Second, a more comprehensive grid of georeferenced chimpanzee samples
that includes genotype profiles at more STRP loci may
make it possible to increase the precision of origin
assignments using the SCAT approach.
Our findings offer promising insights that may augment assessing the location(s) of reintroducing the LWC
chimpanzees back into their natural habitats. IUCN
guidelines suggest that whenever possible, apes should be
reintroduced within their historical range to the lowest
‘unit of conservation action’ [30]. Our results indicate
that Cameroon is the appropriate location for reintroducing these chimpanzees back into the wild as they all
appear to be from the area. Furthermore, their estimated
CAM origins partition closely with the ranges of the two
chimpanzee subspecies occupying Cameroon [24], which
suggests that it may be possible to reintroduce these
chimpanzees back into their historical ranges.
Finally, chimpanzees at refuges are frequently used in
scientific investigations, such as studies that focus on
illuminating the history of zoonotic diseases like SIVcpz
[35,36] and malaria [37]. These studies are often hampered by a lack of knowledge about the geographic origins of these chimpanzees [38]. Several studies have
shown that chimpanzee population history can be very
important for understanding the distribution of disease
[32-34], but these studies have encountered considerable
obstacles owing to the difficulties of working with fecal
samples from reclusive, highly endangered chimpanzee
populations [32]. Refuge chimpanzees are a unique
reservoir for understanding both the history of this species and of zoonotic diseases because they reside in an
environment where it is possible to obtain high-quality
samples for extensive analysis. Our results provide a
foundation for interpreting the findings of these studies
within a precise geographical framework. In conclusion,
these data reveal that illuminating the uncertain origins
of refuge chimpanzees using the SCAT approach is a

Ghobrial et al. BMC Ecology 2010, 10:2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/10/2

powerful tool that can provide valuable information to
local wildlife law enforcement personnel for ascertaining
patterns and trends in chimpanzee hunting, for planning
reintroduction programs and for informing scientific
investigation involving these chimpanzees.

Methods
DNA sample collection and isolation

Veterinarians at the LWC collected whole blood from
46 chimpanzees, during routine health checkups. Georeferenced chimpanzee hair samples were selected from a
collection of samples recovered from abandoned sleeping nests from ten locations throughout Cameroon and
Nigeria reported in previous studies [24,29]. All samples
were transported from Cameroon to the United States
in full compliance with CITES and CDC export and
import regulations. This research was carried out with
IACUC approval from the University at Albany, State
University of New York. DNA was isolated from whole
blood of 46 chimpanzees at the LWC veterinary clinic,
using well-established salting out procedures [39]. These
samples yielded a range of 31-1098 ng/μl of DNA. DNA
from the hair samples was extracted using a chelating
resin protocol [24] followed by filtration using Microcon
100 columns (Millipore - Billerica, MA) to concentrate
DNA extracts.

STRP genotyping and allele size verification

Ten STRP loci were used to produce genotype profiles
from both the georeferenced dataset from previous studies [24] and the 46 LWC chimpanzees. Table 3 lists the
markers chosen labeled with the G5 fluorescent dye set
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) necessary for multiplexing the ten loci into two multiplex PCR reactions
[40,41]. PCR reactions were performed using the Qiagen
Multiplex PCR Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in Eppendorf
Mastercyclers (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY). PCR reactions
involving blood DNA extracts were carried out using the
manufacturer’s protocol and 1 ng of DNA for each reaction. PCR reactions involving hair DNA extracts were
carried out using 0.5 - 1 ng DNA, along with Q-Solution
(provided in the kit) and a 5-10 additional 3-step thermocycles [40,41]. PCR conditions for the georeferenced hair
samples were: 95°C for 15 min, 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 s,
60°C for 90 s, 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension of 60°
C for 30 min. Although many of the hair samples had
been typed previously [29], each of the georeferenced
samples were retyped for this study to avoid differences
in base pair sizes due to apparatus and protocol discrepancies [42]. All PCR reactions included negative control
samples for quality assurance.
Each multiplex PCR product was analyzed on an ABI
3130 capillary array genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Fragment sizes were determined
against Genescan 600 Liz size standard (Applied

(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Alleles were
scored between two and four times to avoid problems
associated with allelic dropout which frequently occurs
when genotyping low-yield DNA samples [43]. Samples
that did not include six or more loci after multiple
attempts at PCR fragment amplification were excluded
from this study.
mtDNA HVRI resequencing

The HVRI of mtDNA was resequenced in each of the
LWC chimpanzees from a 10.6 kb PCR fragment to
reduce problems associated with NUMTs [44,45] with

Ghobrial et al. BMC Ecology 2010, 10:2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/10/2

the following PCR primers: Forward (5’-3’) TATCACTCTCCTACTTACAG and Reverse (5’-3’) ACCTAGAAGGTTGCCTGGCT using touchdown PCR [46]
and High-Fidelity Platinum Taq polymerase following
the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Cycle sequencing reactions were carried out using Big
Dye Ready Reactions Kits and protocols specified by the
manufacturer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)
with the following sequencing primers: Forward (5’-3’)
TTTCCAAGGACAAATCAGAGA and Reverse (5’-3’)
GATAGCATTGCGAGACGCTG. These reactions produced complete upstream and downstream sequences of
the HVRI that were assembled and aligned in
Sequencher 4.8 (GeneCodes Corporation, Ann Arbor,
MI). These mtDNA HVRI sequences were deposited in
DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank International Nucleotide
Sequence Database (accession numbers GU136804GU136849).
mtDNA haplotype analysis

Haplotype networks for HVRI mtDNA sequences were
generated via the median-joining algorithm of Network
4.5 http://www.fluxus-engineering.com. Because it allows
for reticulation, the median-joining approach to the
inference of haplotype relationships is appropriate for
the analyses of mtDNA control region sequences, which
exhibits high levels of homoplasy in humans [47,48].
Hypermutable sites were identified by post-processing
using the Steiner maximum parsimony algorithm within
Network 4.5 and were excluded from the network
analyses.
Assignment tests

The geographic origins of the LWC chimpanzees were
ascertained by smoothed and continuous assignment
techniques implemented in SCAT, version 1.0.2 [11].
SCAT implements a Bayesian approach to estimating
allele frequencies and assigning a geographic origin to
STRP genotype profiles from organisms of unknown origin. These assignments were made by creating a spatial
gradient of allele frequencies from georeferenced genotype profiles followed by estimating the likelihood that
samples of unknown origin share ancestry with the
georeferenced genotype profiles from specific sampling
locations within the study area (smoothed assignment
method, SAM) and/or originate someplace within the
study area independent of where sampling locations are
within the study area (continuous assignment method,
CAM). The parameters a and b control how correlations between allele frequencies decay with distance.
These parameters may be fixed priors or allowed to vary
with a thinning parameter that is large enough to return
consistent results across independent runs. We completed several initial runs with different combinations of
burn-in, iterations and thinning parameters, and found
that results between runs were consistent with a

Page 13 of 15

thinning parameter of 500 for both the SAM and the
CAM analyses. SAM tests were performed with a thinning parameter of 500 with an initial burn-in period of
1,000 replicates and 2,000 iterations for each genotype
profile using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure.
Each SAM estimated origin is the product of least five
independent runs that were started with different random seeds. The most probable location for each sample
was ascertained by the highest mean log-likelihood ratio
of each sample’s assignment across these independent
runs.
CAM tests were also performed to obtain allele frequency estimates from georeferenced samples that were
then used to assign samples of unknown origin. The
CAM test differs from the SAM test in that the CAM
allows each sample’s origin to be located anywhere with
the study area. We completed CAM tests by specifying
a polygon of the study area that included all ten sampling locations of the georeferenced genotype profiles
included in this study, as well as all regions of known
chimpanzee habitat across Nigeria and Cameroon. The
coordinates for this polygon were: N 9.01 E 2.79, N 7.80
E 15.50, N 6.03 E 14.54, N 3.73 E 15.32, N 1.71 E 16.16,
N 2.26 E 9.83, N 3.96 E 9.17, N 4.42 E 5.84, N 6.22 E
4.88, N 6.47 E 2.78, N 9.01 E 2.79. CAM tests were performed with a thinning parameter of 500 with an initial
burn-in period of 1,000 replicates and 2,000 iterations
for each genotype profile using a leave-one-out crossvalidation procedure. Each CAM result is the product of
least five independent runs that started with a different
random seed. For each sample, we obtained CAM
results from 10,000 point coordinate estimates. A single
point estimate for each sample was determined by taking the median of the coordinates from independent
CAM runs. These coordinates were plotted onto a map
of the study area in ArcMap 9.2 (ESRI, 1999-2006). We
constructed confidence intervals for the CAM estimates
for each LWC chimpanzee by plotting 100 coordinates
weighted according to their posterior probability that
were drawn randomly from across all CAM runs.
Finally, we assessed the reliability of CAM estimated origins for LWC chimpanzees inferred to be from southern
Cameroon by creating a larger boundary file that
included the entire range of P. t. troglodytes across central Africa, but not P. t. ellioti. The coordinates for this
polygon were: N 3.76 E 9.61, N 4.29 E 11.29, N 4.48 E
13.63, N 4.14 E 16.30, N 3.98 E 18.59, N 1.66 E 18.10,

3.13 E 9.99 and N 3.76 E 9.61. Run parameters for this
CAM test included a thinning parameter of 500, a burnin of 1,000 iterations and 2,000 replicates after the
burn-in period.
