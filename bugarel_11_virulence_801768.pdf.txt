Virulence gene profiling of enterohemorrhagic
(EHEC) and enteropathogenic (EPEC) Escherichia
coli strains: a basis for molecular risk assessment
of typical and atypical EPEC strains
Marie Bugarel1, Annett Martin2, Patrick Fach1 and Lothar Beutin3*

Abstract
Background: Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) can cause severe disease such as bloody diarrhoea and haemolytic
uraemic syndrome in humans. Besides production of Shiga toxins, the presence of LEE (eae-gene) and non-LEE
(nle) encoded effector genes harboured on O-islands OI-122, OI-71 and OI-57 is associated with EHEC virulence and
their frequency in outbreaks. Genes encoded by the EHEC-plasmid are putative virulence markers of EHEC. EHECplasmids, LEE and non-LEE effector genes have also been detected in some strains of enteropathogenic E. coli
(EPEC). The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between EHEC and EPEC for virulence genes
encoded by genomic O-islands and by the EHEC-plasmids.
Results: Nle genes ent/espL2, nleB and nleE (OI-122), nleA, nleF and nleH1-2 (OI-71), nleG5-2 and nleG6-2 (OI-57), espK
(CP-933N) and the EHEC-plasmid encoded genes ehxA, espP, etpD and katP were searched in 73 typical and in 235
atypical enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) strains. Typical and atypical EPEC each fall into two clusters. Cluster 1
typical (n = 46) and atypical (n = 129) EPEC strains were characterized by the presence of OI-122 encoded genes
and grouped together with 64 investigated EHEC strains. Cluster 2 typical (n = 27) and atypical (n = 106) strains
grouped together with 52 LEE-negative, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) and with 21 apathogenic E. coli strains.
Typical EPEC Cluster 1 strains belonged to serotypes frequently involved in severe illness and outbreaks in children
(O111:H2, O114:H2, O55:H6, O127:H6 and O142:H6). Atypical EPEC Cluster 1 strains were characterized by serotypes
related to EHEC (O26:H11, O55:H7, O145:H28, O103:H2 and O103:H25).
Conclusion: The OI-122 encoded nleB gene was found to be most closely associated with Cluster 1 strains and
may serve as a diagnostic tool for the identification of virulent EHEC and EPEC seropathotypes. OI-71 encoded
genes nleA, nleF and nleH1-2 are less associated with Cluster 1 strains. EHEC-plasmid, OI-57 and CP-933 associated
genes showed only weak similarities with virulent Cluster 1 EHEC and EPEC strains.

Background
Escherichia coli strains that cause diarrhoea in humans
have been divided into different pathotypes according to
their virulence attributes and the mechanisms involved in
the disease process [1,2]. Five major groups of intestinal
pathogenic strains have been established, such as enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enterohemorrhagic E. coli

(EHEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC).
While EPEC is a major cause of infantile diarrhoea in
the developing world, EHEC is associated with foodborne outbreaks in the developed world and can cause
bloody diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis (HC) and the
Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS) due to the elaboration of Shiga toxin (Stx). More than 400 E. coli serotypes that produce Shiga toxins (STEC) have been
described [3]. A small number of these have been
shown to be implicated in severe disease such as HC
and HUS in humans. A classification scheme has been

established to group STEC strains into the five seropathotype groups A-E depending on the severity of disease, the incidence of human infections and the
frequency of their involvement in outbreaks [4].
Strains belonging to the EPEC group have been subdivided into typical and atypical EPEC as these differ from
each other in their adherence mechanisms to human
epithelial cells [5] and in their evolutionary lineages [6].
Typical EPEC adhere in a localized manner mediated by
bundle-forming pili that are encoded by EAF (EPEC
adherence factor) type plasmids harboured by these
strains [5,6]. Atypical EPEC do not carry EAF plasmids
and most of these adhere in a localized adherence-like
pattern to epithelial cells [5]. Some EPEC strains share
similarities with certain EHEC strains in terms of their
O:H serotypes, virulence genes and other phaenotypical
traits [5,7,8].
The chromosomally encoded locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) which is present in both, EPEC and
EHEC strains plays a major role in their pathogenesis.
The LEE carries genes for the attaching and effacing
phenotype promoting bacterial adhesion and the
destruction of human intestinal enterocytes [2,7,9,10].
Besides LEE encoded genes, a large number of non-LEE
effector genes have been found on prophages and on
integrative elements in the chromosome of the typical
EPEC strains B171-8 (O111:NM) [11] and 2348/69
(O127:H6) [12]. In a homology-based search, all nonLEE effector families, except cif, found in the typical
EPEC strains were also present in EHEC O157:H7 Sakai
strain [11,12]. On the other hand, some strain specific
effectors were only present in EHEC O157:H7 (EspK,
EspX) and not in the EPEC strains. Moreover, EPEC
O111 and O127 strains were different from each other
regarding the presence of some effector genes (EspJ,
EspM, EspO, EspV, EspW, NleD, OspB and EspR)
[11,12].
It has been shown that EHEC O157:H7 has evolved
stepwise from an atypical EPEC O55:H7 ancestor strain
[13,14]. Atypical EPEC and EHEC strains of serotypes
O26, O103, O111 and O145 have been found to be
similar in virulence plasmid encoded genes, tir-genotypes, tccP genes, LEE and non-LEE encoded genes indicating that these are evolutionarily linked to each other
[8,15-19]. The classification of these strains into the
EPEC or the EHEC group is merely based on the
absence or presence of genes encoding Shiga toxins
(Stx) 1 and/or 2. In EHEC strains, stx-genes are typically
harboured by transmissible lambdoid bacteriophages
and the loss of stx-genes has been described to be frequent in the course of human infection with EHEC
[20,21]. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated
that stx-encoding bacteriophages can convert non-toxigenic O157 and other E. coli strains into EHEC [22,23].

A molecular risk assessment (MRA) concept has been
developed to identify virulent EHEC strains on the basis
of non-LEE effector gene typing [24] and a number of
nle genes such as nleA, nleB, nleC, nleE, nleF, nleG2,
nleG5, nleG6, nleH1-2 and ent/espL2 have been found
to be significantly associated with EHEC strains causing
HUS and outbreaks in humans [4,16,17,24].
We recently investigated 207 EHEC, STEC, EPEC and
apathogenic E. coli strains for the presence of nle genes
and EHEC virulence plasmid-associated genes. By statistical analysis, two clusters of strains were obtained. OI122 encoded genes ent/espL2, nleB and nleE were most
characteristic for Cluster 1, followed by OI-71 encoded
genes nleH1-2, nleA and nleF. EHEC-plasmid encoded
genes katP, etpD, ehxA, espP, saa and subA showed only
medium to low influence on the formation of clusters.
Cluster 1 was formed by all EHEC (n = 44) and by eight
of twenty-one EPEC strains investigated, whereas Cluster 2 gathered all LEE-negative STEC (n = 111), apathogenic E. coli (n = 30) and the remaining thirteen EPEC
strains [17]. These findings indicate that some EPEC
strains share non-LEE encoded virulence properties with
O157:H7 and other EHEC strains. Such EPEC strains
could be derivatives of EHEC which have lost their stxgenes but could also serve as a reservoir for the generation of new EHEC strains by uptake of stx-phages
[16,20,25,26].
To classify strains of the EPEC group according to
their relationship to EHEC we have investigated 308
typical and atypical EPEC strains for the presence of
nle-genes of O-islands OI-57, OI-71 and OI-122, as well
as prophage and EHEC-plasmid-associated genes. OI122 encoded genes were found to be significantly associated with atypical EPEC strains that showed close
similarities to EHEC regarding their serotypes and other
virulence traits. In typical EPEC, the presence of Oisland 122 was significantly associated with strains
which are frequently the cause of outbreaks and severe
disease in humans.

E. coli pathogroups were established as described in the
Methods section. The frequencies and associations
between virulence genes and E. coli pathogroups are
presented in Table 1. The linkage of genes according to
their respective PAI or the EHEC-plasmid was 94.7%
(230/243) for OI-122, 41.8% (142/340) for OI-71, 46.2%
(80/173) for OI-57 and 1.8% (4/220) for the EHEC-plasmid. As not all PAIs were found to be genetically conserved we decided to perform the cluster analysis on
single genes. The results from the cluster analysis using
thirteen virulence genes that were taken as cluster

variables are presented in Table 2. The 445 strains
belonging to 151 different serotypes divided into two
clusters. Cluster 1 encompassed all 64 EHEC strains, as
well as 46 (63%) of the typical and 129 (54.9%) of the
atypical EPEC strains. The remaining 133 EPEC strains,
as well as all STEC (n = 52) and apathogenic E. coli (n
= 21) were grouped into Cluster 2. The distribution of
PAIs and the EHEC-plasmid according to E. coli
pathogroups is presented in Figure 1.
The influence of the different virulence genes on the
formation of the âEHEC relatedâ Cluster 1 was calculated
using the similarity measure of âRogers and Tanimotoâ
[27]. The results are presented in Table 3. The OI-122
encoded genes nleB, ent/espL2 and nleE were highly
characteristic of Cluster 1 strains (similarity measure > =
0.947). The OI-71 encoded genes nleH1-2, nleA and nleF,
as well as nleG6-2 (OI-57) and espK (CP-933N) were also
found to be characteristic of Cluster 1 strains but to a

lesser degree (similarity measure 0.511-0.684). The presence of the EHEC-plasmid pO157 associated genes and
of nleG5-2 (OI-57) had a minor effect on the formation
of Cluster 1 (similarity measure 0.382-0.445).
Characteristics of typical EPEC belonging to Clusters 1
and 2

Forty-six (63%) of the 73 typical EPEC strains belonging
to nine different serotypes were grouped into Cluster 1.
Cluster 2 comprised 27 strains belonging to 12 serotypes
(Table 2). Typical EPEC Cluster 1 strains were all positive for OI-122 encoded genes ent/espL2, nleB and nleE
(similarity measure 1.0), as well as for nleH1-2 (OI-71)
(similarity measure 0.678) (Table 4). These genes were
absent in typical EPEC Cluster 2 strains, except for
nleH1-2 (23.3% positive). All other genes that were
investigated showed only low similarity (< 0.5) to Cluster 1 (Table 4).

O127:[H40]

The 235 atypical EPEC strains were divided into 80
different serotypes (Table 2). Twenty-five (10.6%) strains
were not typable according to their O-antigens (Tables
8 and 9). With the exception of five serotypes (O26:
H11, O55:H7, O103:H2, O128:H2 and O145:H28), all
others were associated with one cluster only. Strains
belonging to classical EHEC types O26:H11, O103:H2,
O145:H28 and O157:H7 (n = 30) were predominant in
Cluster 1 (23.3%) (Table 8). Only four strains (3.8%) of
classical EHEC serotypes grouped into Cluster 2 (Table 9).
These were one avian O26:H11 strain (negative for OI-122
and OI-71 genes), one human O103:H2 and two human
O145:H28 strains (all negative for OI-122 and OI-71
genes except for nleH1-2).

(89/129 = 69%) and serotypes (28/40 = 70%) belonging to

(63.5%) of 52 STEC were positive for one or more of
EHEC-plasmid associated genes ehxA, espP and katP.
None of the STEC was positive for the plasmid etpD
gene as for all other nle-genes investigated in this study
(Table 1). The 21 apathogenic E. coli strains belonged to
18 different serotypes (Table 2) and were negative for all
virulence markers investigated in this study (Table 1).

Discussion
The concept of molecular risk assessment [24] has been
successfully employed for grouping STEC strains into
those that are associated with outbreaks and life-threatening disease in humans and those which cause less
severe or are not implicated in human disease. The presence of non-LEE effector genes encoded by O-islands
OI-122, OI-71 and OI-57 has been shown to be highly

associated with EHEC strains that were frequently
involved in outbreaks and severe disease in humans
[4,16,17,24,28,29]. In a previous work, we were able to
associate the presence of OI-122 and OI-71 encoded
genes with an âEHEC-Clusterâ comprising forty-four
EHEC strains as well as eight of twenty-one EPEC
strains investigated [17]. This finding indicates that
some EPEC strains are more related to EHEC in their
virulence patterns, than others.
In order to explore this relationship between EPEC
and EHEC more closely, we investigated larger numbers
of strains and serotypes of typical and atypical EPEC for
thirteen virulence genes associated with EHEC O157 Oislands OI-122, OI-71, OI-57, the EHEC-plasmid and
prophage CP-933N. Genes for nleG5-2 and nleG6-2
were included since OI-57 specific genes were previously found to be associated with classical EHEC and
also with some EPEC strains [24,28]. The prophage CP933 associated espK gene was included since its homologues were found in EHEC O157, O26, O103 and O111,
in atypical EPEC O55:H7 but not in typical EPEC O127
and O111 strains [11,12,14,30,31].
Our findings indicate that about half of the typical and
atypical EPEC strains and serotypes are closely related
to EHEC regarding these virulence attributes (Table 2).
The presence of OI-122 encoded genes, followed by OI71 were most significant for the assignment of EPEC to
the âEHEC-relatedâ Cluster 1 confirming data from our
previous study performed on a different collection of
strains [17]. The OI-57 encoded genes nleG5-2 and
nleG6-2, as well as the espK gene were not as strongly
associated with Cluster 1, as the OI-122 and OI-71
genes. Recently, the OI-57 associated genes adfO and
ckf were reported to be present in 30 (71%) of 42 investigated EPEC strains but a high variability of OI-57 associated orfs in EPEC strains was observed [28]. This
could explain the results of our study, where the OI-57
associated nleG5-2 gene was found infrequently in all
EPEC, whereas the nleG6-2 gene was frequent in atypical EPEC (45.5%) but rarely found in typical EPEC
(12.3%) (Table 1). Further work is needed to define the
genes of OI-57 that are most suitable for the molecular
risk assessment of EHEC and EPEC strains.
In our study, EHEC-plasmids were associated with
EHEC, STEC and atypical EPEC, but not with typical
EPEC strains. EHEC-plasmids are frequently harboured
by classical EHEC but also by many LEE-negative STEC
strains [32-34]. Correspondingly, EHEC-plasmid
encoded genes ehxA, etpD, katP and espP had only a
small influence on Cluster 1 formation, confirming
results of previous studies [16,17]. In this study, EHECplasmid genes were significantly more associated with
atypical EPEC Cluster 1 than with Cluster 2 strains. The
high proportion of EHEC-plasmid positives among

Bugarel et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:142
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/142

Cluster 1 strains suggests that many of these may have
derived from EHEC by losing stx-genes. A loss of stxgenes was reported to occur frequently in classical
EHEC strains [23,26]. EHEC-plasmid genes were found
in 23/29 (79.3%) of atypical EPEC Cluster 1 strains
belonging to EHEC related serotypes O26:H11, O103:
H2, O145:H28 and O157:H7 (data not shown). These 30
EHEC-like strains showed the same virulence characteristics (presence of OI-122 genes) as their homologous
EHEC strains.
In addition to this, there are epidemiological findings
pointing to a closer relationship between âCluster 1â
atypical EPEC and EHEC strains. Significantly (p < 0.05)
more typable (78/120 = 65.0%) Cluster 1 strains than
Cluster 2 strains belonged to serotypes (18/40 = 45.0%)
that are associated with the production of Shiga toxins
(38). Only 26.6% (24/90) of the atypical EPEC strains of
Cluster 2 showed O:H types (10/46 = 21.7) previously
associated with Stx-production.
Typical EPEC were also found to split into Cluster 1
and Cluster 2 strains. Cluster 1 was formed by typical
EPEC serotypes O55:H6, O114:H2, O111:[H2], O127:H6
and O142:H6 strains which accounted worldwide for
large outbreaks in hospitals, infant wards and day nurseries with a high mortality rate [35-37]. Cluster 2 typical EPEC accounted for serotypes that were more rarely
associated with outbreaks, except for EPEC O119:H6,
the latter was frequently associated with infantile diarrhoea in Brazil [38,39]. On the basis of these findings, a
seropathotype classification for typical EPEC similar to
those described for STEC [4,24] can be established.
Typical EPEC strains associated with outbreaks and high
mortality are gathered in Cluster 1 which is mainly
characterized by the presence of OI-122 associated
genes ent/espL2, nleB, nleE. These findings are supported by two clinical studies showing that the presence
of OI-122 encoded genes was significantly associated
with diarrhoea in patients infected with atypical EPEC
[40,41]. The function of nle-genes in pathogenesis of
EHEC and EPEC infection is only partially known
[30,42,43]. Further work is needed to explore the contribution of OI-122 effectors to the high infectivity and
virulence of EPEC and EHEC strains resulting in outbreaks and severe disease in humans.
It has been shown previously that the evolution of typical and atypical EPEC has occurred from LEE positive
ancestor strains and divergent phylogenetic groups of
EPEC (EPEC1 to EPEC4) and EHEC (EHEC1 and
EHEC2) were established [1,6,37]. Virulence genes harboured by EAF-plasmids, EHEC-plasmids and stx-phages
were found in phylogenetically unrelated strains indicating that these were acquired several times during evolution [1]. Their horizontal spread to unrelated strains and
the frequent loss of plasmid and bacteriophage inherited

Page 7 of 10

determinants makes these less suitable for identifying
clones associated with high infectivity and virulence in
humans. The OI-122 inherited nle-genes were found to
be significantly associated with highly virulent Cluster 1
strains of EHEC and EPEC. They appear to be more stably inherited than plasmid and phage associated genes
and could thus serve as an additional diagnostic tool for
the reliable identification of EHEC and EPEC infections
in humans, animals and EHEC contamination of food
sources and the environment.

Conclusion
Our results indicate that the OI-122 pathogenicity island
is a common attribute that is significantly associated
with highly virulent EHEC and EPEC strains. Of the OI122 encoded genes, nleB was found as most conserved
and thus presents a suitable marker for genetic screening for human virulent EHEC and EPEC strains. Horizontally transferred genetic elements such as the
virulence-plasmids and phages were less significantly
associated with the highly virulent clones of EHEC and
EPEC strains.
Methods
Bacteria

A total of 445 E. coli strains from the collection of the
National Reference Laboratory for Escherichia coli
(NRL-E.coli) were investigated. These originated from
humans (n = 286), domestic animals (n = 84) and food
(n = 70). Five strains were of unknown origin. The 445
strains were grouped into apathogenic E. coli (n = 21),
atypical EPEC (n = 235), typical EPEC (n = 73), EHEC
(n = 64) and STEC (n = 52) according to the presence
or absence of genes encoding Stx (stx1 + stx2), intimin
(eae) and bundle forming pili (bfpA). All strains were
investigated for their O (lipopolysaccharide) and H (flagellar) serotypes. Non-motile strains were examined for
their flagellar (fliC) genotype as previously described
[44]. Highly purified total DNA of the strains was prepared from 0.5 ml overnight cultures of bacteria using
the RTP Â® Bacteria DNA Mini Kit (Invitek, Berlin,
Germany).
Detection of genes by real-time PCR

To investigate the presence of seventeen genes previously described as virulence markers of STEC, EPEC
and EHEC the real-time PCR method was employed
using the GeneDiscÂ® array as previously described [17],
or the Applied Biosystems 7500 real time PCR system.
Standard cycling conditions (15 sec 94Â°C, 1 min 60Â°C
and 40 cycles) were used for the Applied Biosystems
7500 system. The primers and probes for the detection
of following genes (stx1, stx2, eae, ehxA, espP etpD, katP,
nleA, nleF, nleH1-2 ent/espL2, nleB, nleE) have been

Bugarel et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:142
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/142

described previously [16]. Primers and probes for the
detection of bfpA, nleG5-2, nleG6-2 and espK were
developed for this work (Table 10). The reference
strains for STEC and EHEC were used as previously
described [16]. Strain E2348/69 (O127:H6) [12] served
as control for typical EPEC and strain CB9615 (O55:H7)
[14] as a control of atypical EPEC. E. coli K-12 strain
MG1655 [45] served as a negative control for the eighteen virulence markers investigated in this work.
Definition of E. coli pathogroups

The genes eae, stx1 stx2 and bfpA were used to define E.
coli pathogroups and were therefore not taken as independent variables for the cluster/statistical analysis. On
the genotype basis, the strains were grouped as atypical
EPEC (eae only), typical EPEC (eae and bfpA), STEC
(stx1 and/or stx2), EHEC (eae and stx1 and/or stx2) and
apathogenic E. coli (absence of eae, bfpA, stx1 and stx2).
The presence of the following genes was used to define
clusters of EHEC related and EHEC unrelated strains as
previously described [17]: ehxA, espP, etpD and katP
(EHEC-virulence plasmid pO157), nleA, nleF and nleH12 (OI-71), ent/espL2, nleB and nleE (OI-122). These
variables proved to be useful for the characterization of
STEC and EHEC strains [4,16,17,24,29]. In addition to
this, genes nleG5-2 and nleG6-2 (OI-57) [24] and espK
(prophage CP-933N) [31] had previously been found to
be associated with EHEC [11,12,24,25,28] and therefore
included as new variables for the cluster analysis.
Statistical analysis

The seventeen virulence genes that were investigated in
the 445 E. coli strains are listed in Table 1. To analyse
the relationship between the seventeen virulence factors
investigated in this work and the E. coli pathogroups, the
presence of the virulence factors was calculated per
pathogroup (Table 1). For the analysis of associations

Page 8 of 10

between the virulence factors and the E. coli pathogroups
univariate analysis with a chi-square test was used. If frequencies were low Fisherâs exact tests was used for the
calculation. As a significance level, a was set to 0.05. All
p-values â¤ a were considered statistically significant. To
determine which virulence genes were major contributors in the elimination of the null hypothesis we calculated standardized residuals. When the absolute value of
the residual is greater than 1.00 we can conclude that
there is a major influence on a significant chi-square test
between a given pathotype and the respective virulence
gene (Table 1). A cluster analysis was performed in order
to analyse similarities between the E. coli pathogroups.
Since the presence or absence of virulence genes is binary
scaled, the similarity was calculated according to âRogers
and Tanimotoâ [27]. The linkage between groups was
selected as the cluster method.
