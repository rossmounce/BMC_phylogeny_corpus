Antibacterial activity of traditional medicinal
plants used by Haudenosaunee peoples of New
York State
Frank M Frey*, Ryan Meyers

Abstract
Background: The evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance, as well as the evolution of new strains of disease
causing agents, is of great concern to the global health community. Our ability to effectively treat disease is
dependent on the development of new pharmaceuticals, and one potential source of novel drugs is traditional
medicine. This study explores the antibacterial properties of plants used in Haudenosaunee traditional medicine.
We tested the hypothesis that extracts from Haudenosaunee medicinal plants used to treat symptoms often
caused by bacterial infection would show antibacterial properties in laboratory assays, and that these extracts
would be more effective against moderately virulent bacteria than less virulent bacteria.
Methods: After identification and harvesting, a total of 57 different aqueous extractions were made from 15 plant
species. Nine plant species were used in Haudenosaunee medicines and six plant species, of which three are
native to the region and three are introduced, were not used in traditional medicine. Antibacterial activity against
mostly avirulent (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus lactis) and moderately virulent (Salmonella typhimurium,
Staphylococcus aureus) microbes was inferred through replicate disc diffusion assays; and observed and statistically
predicted MIC values were determined through replicate serial dilution assays.
Results: Although there was not complete concordance between the traditional use of Haudenosaunee medicinal
plants and antibacterial activity, our data support the hypothesis that the selection and use of these plants to treat
disease was not random. In particular, four plant species exhibited antimicrobial properties as expected (Achillea
millefolium, Ipomoea pandurata, Hieracium pilosella, and Solidago canadensis), with particularly strong effectiveness
against S. typhimurium. In addition, extractions from two of the introduced species (Hesperis matronalis and Rosa
multiflora) were effective against this pathogen.
Conclusions: Our data suggest that further screening of plants used in traditional Haudenosaunee medicine is
warranted, and we put forward several species for further investigation of activity against S. typhimurium (A.
millefolium, H. matronalis, I. pandurata, H. pilosella, R. multiflora, S. canadensis).

Background
North American Native American peoples used approximately 2,600 species of vascular plants in traditional
medicines [1,2]. This figure represents roughly 10% of
all vascular plant species in North America, and there is
evidence that the choice of medicinal plants was nonrandom [3] and closely linked to phylogenetic relationships [4]. This bias in selectivity may speak to the

efficacy of traditional remedies in the context of shared
evolutionary descent (i.e., therapeutic compounds conserved among closely related plant species) much in the
same way that certain classes of molecules are conserved
among families such as the Apocynaceae (cardioactive
glycosides), Caprifoliaceae (cyanogenic glycosides), Papaveraceae (alkaloids), and Solonaceae (glycoalkaloids) [5].
In Upstate New York, the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois)
peoples used approximately 450 plant species in traditional medicine [6,7], which is similar in number to
plant species used medicinally by neighboring First
Nations Peoples in eastern Canada [8]. A number of

studies have demonstrated concordance between selectivity of plants among First Nations Peoples to treat specific symptoms and demonstrated antibacterial,
antifungal, and antiviral activity in the laboratory [9-16].
In this study, we use similar approaches to provide the
first investigation of the antibacterial properties of plants
used in Haudenosaunee traditional medicine.
We selected 15 plants for our investigation and
screened them against four bacterial species. Four plants
are considered among the most powerful medicines in
traditional Haudenosaunee culture (Achillea millefolium,
Asclepias syriaca, Ipomoea pandurata, Malva neglecta),
serving as panacea remedies for a diversity of physical
and spiritual ailments [6,7]. Five plants were used in
Haudenosaunee medicines to treat a diversity of ailments (Cimicifuga racemosa, Hieracium pilosella, Lycopodium digitatum, Ranunculus acris, Solidago
canadensis); although these were not considered among
the approximately 150 most powerful medicines [6,7],
they were well represented in regional Native American
medicines [1,2]. In addition, we selected two native
plant species (Arabis glabra, Silene virginica) and four
introduced species (Hesperis matronalis, Myosotis scorpioides, Rosa multiflora, Silene latifolia) with no record
of medicinal use among Haudenosaunee peoples
[1,2,6,7].
We chose to test these plants against four bacterial
species that vary with respect to their disease modality
and virulence (Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium
[Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium], Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus [Lactococcus] lactis). Streptococcus lactis is a gram-positive
species used extensively in the dairy industry and
regarded as an avirulent opportunistic human pathogen
[17-19]; similarly, E. coli is a gram-negative human
enteric species that is generally avirulent but sometimes
causes weakly virulent gastroenteritis and urinary tract
infections [19]. Salmonella typhimurium is a gram-negative pathogen that most commonly causes enterocolitis,
and S. aureus is a gram-positive pathogen that most
commonly causes abscess, food poisoning, and toxic
shock syndrome; both are considered to be more virulent than S. lactis and E. coli [19].
Broadly, we hypothesized that we would find congruity
between the use of particular plant species to treat specific symptoms by Haudenosaunee peoples and demonstrated antibacterial properties. Specifically, we
hypothesized that plants used to treat symptoms possibly associated with bacterial pathogens (e.g., antipyretics,
antidiarrheals, antiemetics, broad gastrointestinal treatments, dermatological ailments, etc.) would show more
antibacterial activity than those plants used to treat
other symptoms (e.g., analgesics, blood medicines, contraceptives, etc.). Additionally, we hypothesized that the

greatest antibacterial effects would be observed in the
more moderately virulent pathogens (S. typhimurium
and S. aureus) compared to the less virulent pathogens
(S. lactis and E. coli).

Methods
Plant collection and extract preparation

Plants used in traditional medicine by the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederacy in Madison County, NY
USA were researched and located in field surveys (Table
1). Voucher specimens were prepared and submitted to
the George R. Cooley Herbarium (GRCH). With the
exception of Lycopodium digitatum in which only leaf
material was collected, roots, shoots, leaves, and flowers
of all plant species were collected and transported to
the laboratory on ice where they were prepared immediately for extraction. At least six individual plants were
collected for each species and plant material was pooled
prior to making extractions. Four grams of pooled plant
material was rinsed with sterile water (with the exception of flowers), cut into thin sections using a sterile
razor blade and combined with 40 mL of sterile water.
The mixture was homogenized using a sterile mortar
and pestle, and the resulting solution was placed in a
sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube, gently shaken at 4°C overnight, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 minutes to
pellet solids. The supernatant was then withdrawn,
placed in a sterile 25 mL scintillation vial, and stored at
4°C. Extracts were tested using the disk diffusion technique within 48 hours of preparation and tested using the
96-well plate assay within a week of collection. A total
of 57 different extracts were created from these 15
plants, and at least two replicate extractions were made
for each. The initial concentration of extracts used in all
assays was 100 mg fresh material to 1 mL of water.
Preparations of inoculums of microorganisms

Extracts were screened against two gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli [Presque Isle No.336] and Salmonella typhimurium [Presque Isle No.381]) and two
gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus [Presque
Isle No.4651] and Streptococcus lactis [Presque Isle
No.525]). Escherichia coli and S. aureus were maintained
on Liquid Broth (LB) slant cultures (Krackeler Scientific,
Albany, NY USA), and S. typhimurium and S. lactis
were maintained on Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) slant
cultures (Krackeler Scientific, Albany, NY USA). All
slant cultures were kept at 37°C. Twenty-four hours
before screening with disc diffusion or 96-well plate
assays, replicate liquid cultures were started by placing a
loopful of bacteria from the slant cultures into 10 mL of
appropriate sterile media (E. coli and S. aureus in LB; S.
typhimurium and S. lactis in BHI) and grown at 37°C.
Immediately prior to all experiments, the turbidity of

each liquid culture for use in the assays was adjusted to
0.5 McFarland Units (approx. 1 × 10 8 CFU/mL) using
sterile LB or BHI.
Disc diffusion assays

The sensitivity of different bacterial strains to the aqueous plant extracts was measured using a standard agar
diffusion assay [20]. Sterile 100 × 15 mm Petri plates
containing bacto-agar (Krackeler Scientific, Albany, NY
USA) and either LB or BHI were prepared prior to
beginning the assays, and 100 μL of liquid bacterial culture was spread onto plates with the appropriate media
using sterile technique (E. coli and S. aureus on LB; S.
typhimurium and S. lactis on BHI). Immediately prior to
their placement on the plates, 10 μL of extract (100 mg/
mL) was pipetted onto a 6 mm sterile filter paper disc.
Each plate contained four paper discs; two discs contained extracts, one disc served as a negative control (10
μL sterile water), and one disc served as a positive

control (10 μL of 10 mg/mL ampicillin). Each extract
was tested on three replicate plates, and the plates were
inverted and incubated at 37°C for 24 hours before
being digitally photographed. Images were uploaded to a
computer and zones of inhibition were calculated using
ImageJ http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/. For each image, the
pixel-to-centimeter relationship was calculated using a
standard reference contained in the image, and the area
and diameter of the zone of inhibition was measured
directly. All zones of inhibition were circular.
96-well plate assays

Sixteen of the extracts were selected for use in the 96well plate assay because they caused substantial zones of
inhibition on one or more of the bacteria tested. Serial
dilutions of each of these extracts were prepared using
sterile water to produce final concentrations of 100%
(not diluted), 50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.25%, and 3.125%. In
terms of fresh material to solvent, these dilutions

represent concentrations of 100 mg/mL, 50 mg/mL, 25
mg/mL, 12.5 mg/mL, 6.25 mg/mL, and 3.125 mg/mL,
respectively. The procedures used in this assay were
similar to those used in another study where an indicator solution changes from clear to red in proportion to
the degree of bacterial activity [21]. To start, the twelverow by eight-column plate was visually divided into four
sections of two columns each; one column was designated the “experimental” column and one was designated the “control”. Each of these two-column sections
was used to test a single extract as follows. Bacteria
were prepared as described above (approx. 1 × 10 8
CFU/mL) to provide enough stock to fill all plates for
all extracts tested (i.e., all of the tests involving a single
bacteria species were performed on the same day).
Then, 100 μL of liquid culture was placed into each cell
of the experimental column along with 100 μL of each
of the following solutions down the 8 rows: positive
control (10 mg/mL ampicillin), negative control (sterile
water), 100%, 50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.25%, and 3.125%
extract. The positive control cell (ampicillin) should
have no bacterial activity and remain clear, whereas the
negative control cell (water) should have bacterial activity and change to red, providing reference points to
quantify the inhibitory effects of the extract dilutions.
The control column only contained 100 μL of the positive control (ampicillin), negative control (water), and
extraction dilution solutions (i.e., identical to the experimental column except no bacteria were present). Plates
were prepared in triplicate such that each extract-bacteria combination was replicated across 96-well plates.
Plates were covered and incubated at 37°C for 24 hours.
After the 24-hour incubation, 40 μL of a 0.2 mg/mL piodonitrotetrazolium violet (INT) indicator solution was
simultaneously added to every well and the plate was
incubated at 37°C for an additional 30 minutes. The
INT indicator solution changes from clear to red in the
presence of bacterial activity and the degree of redness
is a good measure of inhibitory effects [21]. Following
the 30-minute incubation, plates were digitally
photographed.
In order to assess the inhibitory effects of each of the
extracts, images were uploaded to a computer and ImageJ http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/ was used to calculate the
mean gray value by converting each pixel within the
well to grayscale and then summing the gray values of
all the pixels in the well and then dividing by the total
number of pixels. ImageJ uses a standard formula to
perform this conversion: gray = 0.299 red + 0.587 green
+ 0.114 blue. Then, the mean gray value of the cell containing the extract alone was subtracted from the cell
containing the extract and bacteria combination to
remove the effects of extract coloration on gray value.
This difference was divided by the negative control

(water) gray value to determine the fraction of bacteria
alive in the experimental cell relative to the cell containing only water, and for simplicity of interpretation this
quotient was subtracted from 1 to convert the fractions
into a “proportion killed” as opposed to a “proportion
alive”. Although it is possible to split out the red values
independent of the green and blue values and perform a
similar analysis, preliminary experiments with a series of
controlled-dye solutions showed that converting to gray
values explained more of the observed variation in color
(Frey, unpublished data).
Statistical analyses

In the disc diffusion assays, the average size of the zone
of inhibition (N = 3) is reported for those extracts that
resulted in a consistent and noticeable kill zone compared to the diameter of the filter paper disc (6 mm).
These extract-bacteria combinations were selected for
use in the 96-well plate assays. For each extract-bacteria
combination, a regression analysis was performed as follows [22]. We first transformed concentration values by
taking the negative value of the base-10 logarithm for
each. This generated an x-axis whereby the smallest
value (-2) denoted the strongest concentration (100%),
the largest value (-0.49) denoted the weakest concentration (3.125%), and the slopes of the relationship were
negative. Then, we regressed the transformed concentration value on proportion killed for each extract-bacteria
combination to estimate the slope and y-intercept of the
observed relationship. In addition to determining the
strength and explanatory power of this linear relationship, we calculated a conservative estimate of the xintercept. To do this, we determined the 95% confidence
limits of the observed regression coefficient and then
used the upper 95% limit as well as the observed yintercept to calculate a predicted x-intercept. In other
words, we used the steepest of likely slopes to predict
the largest concentration at which the extract would
stop killing bacteria. Once we determined this x-intercept, we back-transformed it to values of mg/mL
extract. The smallest directly observable MIC in our
experiment is 3.125 mg/mL; however, the strength of
the observed linear relationships in our study gives us a
fair amount of confidence in our conservatively predicted estimate as well.

Results
Of the 57 aqueous extracts, only 11 resulted in consistent inhibition zones against one or more of the bacteria
tested in the disc diffusion assays (Table 2). There were
a total of 16 extract-bacteria combinations that yielded
inhibition zones. The average inhibition zone diameter
of the extracts was substantially smaller (roughly one
third) than that caused by ampicillin (10 mg/mL). Three

of the extractions caused inhibition zones in more than
one of the bacterial species tested (A. millefolium flower:
S. typhimurium and S. aureus; I. pandurata leaf: E. coli,
S. typhimurium, S. aureus, S. lactis; R. multiflora flower:
E. coli and S. typhimurium). There was little consistency
among extractions made from different parts of the
same plant. In no case did all four extractions from a
single species result in inhibition zones against the same
bacterial species; in only three cases did extractions
made from two different parts of the same plant result
in inhibition zones against the same bacteria (H. pilosella, I. pandurata, and R. multiflora). One extract
caused a S. lactis inhibition zone, three extracts caused
an E. coli inhibition zone, five extracts caused a S. typhimurium inhibition zone, and seven extracts caused a S.
aureus inhibition zone.
The serial dilution assay suggested that the inhibitory
effects of the 16 extract-bacteria combinations revealed
in the disc diffusion assay were dose dependent (Table
3). In all cases, concentration explained a significant
amount of variation in the proportion of bacteria killed
as measured using the INT indicator solution (average
R 2 value = 74%; negative slope in all cases). Figure 1
shows a graphical example of the statistical relationships. The directly observable MIC for S. aureus in most

cases was 12.5 mg/mL, except for the S. canadensis leaf
extraction where the MIC was 3.125 mg/mL. All other
extract-bacteria combinations had directly observable
MICs of 3.125 mg/mL.
We used the 95% confidence interval associated with
the slope of each regression analyses to conservatively
predict the MIC drawing on the linear trend observed
in the serial dilution assay. Although by no means conclusive, this analysis gives insight into the relative efficacy of the extractions. The conservative nature of these
estimates is illustrated by most of the S. aureus results
where the predicted MIC is greater than the observed
MIC. This analysis suggests that particular extract-bacteria combinations may result in MICs on the order of
tens of μg/mL (H. matronalis stem - S. typhimurium; H.
pilosella leaf - S. typhimurium; I. pandurata leaf - E.
coli; R. multiflora leaf - E. coli) or hundreds of μg/mL
(A. millefolium flower - S. typhimurium; I. pandurata
leaf - S. typhimurium; R. multiflora flower - E. coli and
S. typhimurium).

Discussion
Traditional Haudenosaunee medicine involves a number
of plant species native to NY. We selected a small subset of these plants and attempted to determine whether

they exhibited antibacterial properties as measured
through two different assays. In the discussion that follows, we first interpret these data with respect to our
two main hypotheses and then turn to a discussion of
those species that might indeed exhibit antibacterial
properties. Before doing so, there are two important
caveats of our study to highlight. First, although the
medicinal uses of these plants were in the form of
water-based poultices, decoctions, and infusions [6,7],
our extraction method most certainly does not capture
the nuances of the actual preparations used. Second, we
have no evidence that the bacteria used in this study (e.
g., S. typhimurium) were indeed the causal agents
underlying the symptoms associated with the use of
these plants (e.g., infusion of smashed A. millefolium
plants to treat diarrhea).
Our data are mixed with respect to the hypothesis
that a correlation exists between the use of Haudenosaunee medicinal plants and antibacterial properties.
Our analyses failed to find any evidence of antibacterial
activity for three plants used in Haudenosaunee medicines (A. syriaca, M. neglecta, and R. acris) to treat
broad-spectrum gastrointestinal ailments and as an antidiarrheal [6,7]. However, extractions from four plants

exhibited antibacterial properties as expected (A. millefolium, I. pandurata, H. pilosella, and S. canadensis), and
it is interesting to note that neither of the two plant
species used to treat non-bacterial symptoms (C. racemosa and L. digitatum), and only one of the native
plant species without an ascribed medicinal use did so
(S. virginica). We also hypothesized that if these plants
had antibacterial properties, we would likely observe
stronger effects in moderately virulent gram-negative
and gram-positive bacteria (S. typhimurium and S. aureus) than in mostly avirluent gram-negative and grampositive bacteria (E. coli and S. lactis). The data are in
line with this prediction as 12/16 (75%) of the extracts
causing inhibition zones did so against the moderately
virulent bacteria. Taken together, these data suggest that
although there is not complete concordance between
ascribed use and antibacterial activity in the laboratory,
the selection and use of these plants to treat disease was
likely non-random.
Yarrow (A. millefolium) is recognized as a powerful
medicinal plant in Haudenosaunee culture [6,7], is
widely distributed and has been used medicinally by a
number of other cultures for thousands of years [23]. In
our study, A. millefolium showed antibacterial activity

Figure 1 Antibacterial activity of I. pandurata. Results of 96-well plate assay for I. pandurata leaf extracts on all four bacteria. The average
proportion (± 1 standard error; n = 3) of bacteria killed by each extract dilution is shown with a fitted linear regression line (see Table 2). To
facilitate analyses, the extract concentration has been transformed by taking the negative base-10 logarithm (strongest to weakest dilution left to
right). Diamonds and the dashed line denote E. coli (EC), squares and the dotted line denote S. typhimurium (ST), triangles and the solid black

against S. typhimurium and S. aureus with predicted
MICs on the order of 10 s of μg/mL or 10 s of mg/mL,
respectively. A number of studies have investigated the
antibacterial properties of this species [24-28] and found
similar results to those presented here. One difference,
however, is that two studies found that ether-hexanemethanol extracts of Yarrow caused inhibition zones
against E. coli in disc diffusion assays [27,28], whereas
our study with aqueous extracts of flower, leaves, roots,
and shoots and a separate study of essential oil and
methanolic extracts [26] did not. These differing results
could be due to the different extraction methods used
or regional variation in the chemical constituents of the
plants. It is well known that Yarrow represents a diverse,
polyploid complex that is probably composed of dozens
of species with varying biochemical compositions [29].
The biochemical diversity of this complex has been
fairly well described [30,31], and it has been hypothesized that phenolic compounds such as flavonoids and
phenolcarbonic acids may underlie the observed antimicrobial activity [27,28,31]. A number of other studies
have found additional therapeutic properties including
anti-inflammatory [32], antioxidant [26], and antinociceptive [33] properties. Moreover, there is growing evidence that both flavonoids and sesquiterpenoids have

anti-proliferative effects against mouse P-388 leukemia
cells [34] and cervix epithelial adenocarcinoma (HeLa),
breast epithelial adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) and skin epidermoid carcinoma (A431) cells [35]. Clearly, Yarrow
holds great potential as a source of many new drugs.
Man-of-the-Earth (I. pandurata) is also recognized as
a powerful medicinal plant in Haudenosaunee culture
[6,7], but is far less studied than Yarrow. In fact, we
know of no previous investigations into the possible
therapeutic properties of this species. Our results show
that aqueous leaf extracts are strong inhibitors of all
species of bacteria used in this study with predicted
MICs of 1-10 s of μg/mL against E. coli and S. typhimurium and 100-1000 s of μg/mL against S. aureus and
S. lactis. There are a few other investigations of other
morning glory species in the literature showing antibacterial properties of I. batatas [36], I. murucoides [37]
and I. stans [38]. In addition, there are studies demonstrating antifungal properties of undescribed Ipomoea
species [39], antinociceptive properties of I. pes-caprae
[40] and I. cairica [41], anti-inflammatory and anti-spasmodic activity of I. imperati [42], central nervous system
depressant activity of I. stans [43] as well as cytotoxic
activity [38], and antimycobacterial and cytotoxic activity
of I. tyrianthina [44,45].

Mouseear Hawkweed (H. pilosella) and Canada goldenrod (S. canadensis) were both used by Haudenosaunee
peoples to treat gastrointestinal ailments and diarrhea
[6,7]. Our results show that mouseear hawkweed may
weakly inhibit S. aureus (predicted MICs of 10 s of mg/
mL) and more strongly inhibit S. typhimurium (predicted MIC of 1-10 s of μg/mL). These results are consistent with the results of a separate study that utilized
methanol, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and dichloromethane:methanol (9:1) extractions [46], and with a
study that utilized methanol and aqueous extracts [47];
however, our aqueous extractions were not effective
against E. coli as in the other extractions of these two
studies. We are aware of only two other investigations
of this species, finding that flavonoids from H. pilosella
have antioxidant activity [46,48]. Canada goldenrod only
inhibited S. aureus in our study at a relatively weak predicted MIC (1-10 s of mg/mL). Although we know of
no other studies that have investigated the antimicrobial
properties of this species, methanol extractions of root
tissue show moderate antioxidant activity [49], and two
studies have documented the antifungal properties of
the essential oil of S. chilensis [50] and the anti-inflammatory properties of ethanol extracts of S. chilensis [51].
It was somewhat surprising that Fire Pink (S. virginica) weakly inhibited the growth of S. aureus (predicted
MIC of 10 s of mg/mL). The Silene complex is well
known for phytoecdysteroids [52,53], but this is the first
report of possible antibacterial properties. Likewise, it
was surprising that Dames Rocket (H. matronalis) was
strongly effective against S. typhimurium (predicted
MIC of 1-10 s of μg/mL) because we know of no other
studies showing any therapeutic properties of this genus.
There are a number of studies demonstrating the nutritional, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and anti-oxidant
properties of Multiflora Rose (R. multiflora) hips and
other members of the genus [54,55]. A study of wild
rose hips in Canada found some evidence for weak antimicrobial activity against yeast and gram-positive bacteria [56]. However, our results show that flower and
leaf aqueous extracts are effective against gram-negative
bacteria (E. coli and S. typhimurium) at predicted MICs
on the order of 10 s of μg/mL.

Conclusions
Growing antibiotic resistance among human pathogens
[57-59] and new data showing that antibiotic-resistant
E. coli can protect antibiotic-sensitive S. typhimurium
without gene transfer [60], emphasize the importance of
finding new antibacterial molecules. Our data suggest
that investigating traditional Haudenosaunee medicinal
plants may yield promising new leads. The degree of
concordance between traditional use and observed antibacterial properties suggest that there may be some

Page 8 of 10

truth to these remedies. In particular, our results suggest
that A. millefolium, H. pilosella, I. pandurata, and S.
canadensis warrant further study, as does the previously
undocumented H. matronalis, especially in the context
of S. typhimurium. Elucidating the mode of action
behind these observed antibacterial properties, as well as
exploring other pharmacological activities is currently
underway in our lab.
