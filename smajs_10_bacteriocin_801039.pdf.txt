Abstract
Background: Bacteriocin production is an important characteristic of E. coli strains of human origin. To date, 26
colicin and 9 microcin types have been analyzed on a molecular level allowing molecular detection of the
corresponding genes. The production incidence of 29 bacteriocin types and E. coli phylogroups were tested in a
set of 361 E. coli strains isolated from human urinary tract infections (UTI) and in 411 control strains isolated from
feces of patients without bacterial gut infection.
Results: Production of 17 and 20 individual bacteriocin types was found in the UTI and control strains, respectively.
Microcin H47 encoding determinants were found more often among UTI strains compared to controls (37.9% and
27.0% respectively, p = 0.02) and strains producing microcin H47 belonged predominantly to phylogroup B2 when
compared to other bacteriocin producers (67.4% and 36.7%, respectively; p < 0.0001). Producers of 3 or more
identified bacteriocin types were more common in the UTI group (20.0% compared to 12.4% in controls, p = 0.03).
In the UTI strains, there was a markedly higher number of those producing colicin E1 compared to controls (22.1%
to 10.2%, respectively, p = 0.0008). Moreover, colicin E1 production was more common in the UTI
bacteriocinogenic strains with multi-producer capabilities. As shown by Southern blotting, pColE1 DNA was not
recognized by the ColIa probe and vice versa suggesting that pColE1 was independently associated with pColIa in
UTI strains.
Conclusion: E. coli strains isolated from human urinary tract infections showed increased incidence of microcin
H47 and colicin E1 production, respectively. Moreover, colicin E1 itself appears to be a potentially important
virulence factor of certain uropathogenic E. coli strains.

Background
Bacteriocins are a diverse group of gene encoded antibacterial agents including corpuscular bacteriocins, colicins, and microcins. While there is indirect evidence of
presence of corpuscular bacteriocins in the genus
Escherichia [1], they have not been unequivocally identified in this genus where only production of proteinaceous colicins and low molecular weight microcins
has been directly demonstrated. Both colicins and
microcins have a relatively narrow spectrum of activity,

predominantly comprising strains of the same species
(colicins) and strains of the same and related species
(microcins).
Uropathogenic strains of E. coli (UPEC) form a subgroup of extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC)
strains and cause human urinary tract infections (UTI).
Previous studies showed that there are several virulence
factors associated with UPEC strains including adhesins,
a-hemolysin and aerobactin production, cytotoxic necrotizing factor, and microcin V (previously known as colicin V) [2-7]. The ColV plasmids (i.e. in present
terminology microcin V encoding plasmids) have been
found to be associated with increased pathogenicity of
E. coli strains [8]. The microcin V encoding gene, cvaC,
has been found more frequently in cases of pyelonephritis

compared to cases of other clinically distinct UTI infection
syndromes, including cystitis and prostatitis [9], suggesting
a possible role for the genes located on the microcin Vencoding plasmids in the pathogenesis of pyelonephritis.
Moreover, bacteremic isolates of E. coli strains were more
often characterized by plasmid encoded microcin V production [10] whereas in intestinal strains, microcin V was
most often chromosomally encoded. Nevertheless, there
are contradictory results regarding the role of microcin V
in bacterial virulence [11,12].
Bacteriocin production is an important characteristic
of E. coli and several related species in the Enterobacteriaceae family. Within the genus Escherichia, bacteriocin
production is almost exclusively associated with strains
of E. coli [13]. Moreover, there is increasing evidence
indicating that bacteriocins are important elements in
bacterial ecology and are linked to their possible probiotic effects [14-18]. However, the precise ecological role
of bacteriocins in microbial competitions among different bacterial populations in complex bacterial communities is not yet exactly known. The variability of
bacteriocin types, different modes of molecular action,
varying entry routes into susceptible bacteria, and the
number of additional genes present on bacteriocin genophores are just some of the obfuscating factors. To date,
26 colicin types [19-22] have been described in detail. In
addition, nine microcin types have been analyzed on a
molecular level allowing molecular detection of the corresponding genes [23-25]. To study the clinical and ecological importance of bacteriocin synthesis, detection of
their specific types is needed due to their diversity and
also due to the molecular diversity of the genes encoded
on the plasmids or chromosomal regions in question. In
this communication, we compare colicin and microcin
types identified in two groups of E. coli strains isolated
from healthy human guts and from human urinary tract
infections.

Results
Detection system for 23 different colicin types

Primers shown in Additional file 1 were used to detect
23 colicin types and microcin C7. The detection system
for 5 additional microcin types including mB17, mH47,
mJ25, mL, and mV was taken from Gordon and O’Brien
[26]. With the exception of cloacin DF13, pesticin I, and
bacteriocin 28b, this system is able to detect all colicin
types so far characterized on a molecular level. All primer pairs were tested on all 23 established colicin type
producers to detect cross-reactivity with other colicin
types. Cross-reactivity of the PCR amplification tests
was observed in the following combinations: primers for
colicin E3 gene also detected colicin E6; E6 primers also
detected colicins E2, E3, E5, E8 and E9; E7 primers also
detected colicin E4; E8 primers also detected colicin E7;

Ib primers also detected colicin Ia; colicin U primers
also detected colicin Y and vice versa and primers for
colicin 5 also detected colicin 10. Identification of crossreacting colicin producers therefore required sequencing
of the corresponding amplicons, which was performed
for all identified colicins E2-E9, Ia-Ib, U-Y, and 5-10.
Bacteriocin mono- and multi-producers among the
control and UTI strains

Bacteriocin types identified in control and UTI strains
are shown in Table 1 and statistically significant differences between bacteriocin producing and non-producing
strains are shown in Table 2. In the UTI E. coli strains,
195 bacteriocin producing strains (54.0%) were identified
among 361 tested. This incidence was not significantly
different from bacteriocin producers in the control
strains (226 out of 411, 55.0%). Mono-producers and
strains producing two identifiable bacteriocin types
(double producers) were similarly distributed among
both UTI and control groups (mono-producers: 48.7%
and 45.6%, respectively; double producers: 30.1%
and 28.2%, respectively). Within bacteriocin monoproducers, reduced frequency of strains producing either
colicin Ia or Ib was found (5.1% and 13.7% among UTI
strains and controls, respectively, p = 0.003). Bacterial
strains with 3 or more bacteriocin encoding determinants were significantly more common in the UTI
group (20.0% compared to 12.4% in controls, p = 0.03).
Both UTI and control strains showed a similar percentage of unidentified bacteriocin types (6.2% and 8.8%,
respectively), indicating the presence of, as yet, unknown
bacteriocin versions or types in E. coli strains.
Bacteriocin types in the control and UTI strains

If the number of individual bacteriocin determinants in
each group of producer strains was counted irrespective
of the co-produced bacteriocins, 17 and 20 types were
identified among the UTI and control strains, respectively. Colicins A, D, E3, E5, E6, E8, E9, 10 and microcin
B17 were not detected in either group. In addition to
these, colicins E4, S4, U, 5 and microcin L were not
detected in the UTI strains.
Among the UTI strains, there was a marked increase
in the number of strains producing colicin E1 compared
to controls (22.1% to 10.2%, respectively, p = 0.0008).
This increased incidence of colicin E1 encoding determinants was not associated with mono-producers or
with double producers. However, in triple producers
and multi-producers, this association was very strong
compared to control strains (14.4% and 4.0% respectively, p = 0.0002). Microcin H47 encoding determinants
were found more often among UTI strains compared to
controls (37.9% and 27.0% respectively, p = 0.02).
Majority of the microcin H47 encoding strains were

*colicin types are given without prefix, mic stands for microcin

mono-producers with higher incidence among UTI
strains compared to controls (30.8% and 20.8% respectively, p = 0.02).
E. coli phylogroups and colicin production

All investigated strains were phylogenetically analyzed
using triplex PCR [27]. There was a marked increase of
the B2 genotype in the UTI group compared to controls
(59.0% and 42.1%, respectively; p < 0.0001), and a
decreased incidence of the A genotype (19.4% and
31.1%, respectively; p = 0.0002). Additionally, a higher
incidence of the B2 phylogroup was found in the UTI
strains of male origin (74.1%, data not shown) compared
with UTI strains of female origin (54.4%, p = 0.001).
Distribution of producer and non-producer strains
among E. coli genotypes is shown in Table 3. In the
E. coli phylogroup B1, the incidence of bacteriocin producing strains was significantly lower among UTI strains
when compared to controls.
The incidence of colicinogenic strains among all
strains including both UTI and control strains was
higher in the phylogroup A (56.3% and 39.0%, respectively; p = 0.0007) and D (53.4% and 39.0%, respectively;

p = 0.009) when compared to B2 (data not shown). In
contrast, group B2 showed higher incidence of microcin-encoding strains when compared to strains of group
A (56.0% and 37.7%, respectively; p = 0.0003) and D
(56.0% and 39.0%, respectively; p = 0.002). Producers of
microcin H47 belonged more frequently to group B2
(data not shown) when compared to other bacteriocin
producers (67.2% and 36.9%, respectively; p < 0.0001)
and less frequently to groups A (10.4% and 35.5%,
respectively; p < 0.0001) and B1 (0.7% and 4.5%, respectively; p < 0.04).
ColE1 plasmids in multi-producer strains

Strains producing the combination of colicins Ia and E1
were more common in the UTI group compared to controls (9.7% and 4.4%, respectively, p = 0.03) as well as
strains producing bacteriocins Ia, E1 and mV (8.7% and
3.1%, respectively, p = 0.01). To test whether these producers synthesizing colicin E1 contain regular low molecular
weight pColE1 plasmids or only colicin E1-encoding
determinants located on larger plasmids, the plasmid size
of 12 colicin E1 producing strains, selected at random, was
estimated using the Southern blotting procedure with

colicin E1 and colicin Ia probes (Figure 1). Most of these
strains synthesized also colicin Ia and microcin V. As
shown by Jeziorowski and Gordon [28], when colicin Ia
and microcin V co-occur, they are encoded on the same
conjugative plasmid as a result of integration of microcin
V operon and several other genes into the pColIa plasmid.
As shown by Southern blot analysis, all tested colicin E1
producers had low molecular weight plasmid DNA recognized by colicin E1 probe with size ranging from 6.8 to 10
kb (for 6 plasmid samples see Figure 1). To verify the
pColE1 plasmid sizes, XL-PCR approach was used to
amplify the entire pColE1 using complementary primers
recognizing colicin E1 operon. In 10 out 12 samples, a
successful DNA amplification resulted in PCR product
size ranging between 7.0 - 10 kb (data not shown). The
colicin Ia probe hybridized with a higher molecular weight

plasmid DNA (Figure 1) indicating that these strains harbor colicin E1 plasmids together with an additional bacteriocin-encoding plasmid.

Discussion
A detection system for 23 different colicin types was
designed and tested. Together with previously published
microcin primer set [26], most of the well characterized
bacteriocins in the genus Escherichia can be identified.
Gordon and O’Brien [26] found 102 bacteriocin producing strains among 266 (38%) human E. coli strains,
whereas in our study, 55% (226/411) of E. coli control
strains (of similar human origin) were bacteriocin producers. Gordon and O’Brien detected eleven colicin
types and seven microcin types. With the exception of
microcin M (which co-occurs with microcin H47), all

B2041 and B830 were all producers of colicins E1, Ia, and microcin
V. Strain B961 produced colicins E1, Ia, E7, K and microcin V. Strain
B953 produced colicins E1, Ia, and microcins V and H47. Please note
that patterns of undigested plasmid DNA were different in panel B
and C, respectively, indicating that colicin Ia and E1 genes are
located on separate plasmids.

types used in the published study [26] were tested in the
present work. Since the identification scheme of bacteriocin producers, including indicator strains and cultivation conditions, differed in both studies, it is likely that
the 17% difference reflects the primary identification of
producer strains. In our study, 6.2% and 8.8% of strains
in both control and UTI strains, respectively, produced
unidentified bacteriocins. Appearance of inhibition
zones, inducibility with mitomycin C and sensitivity to
trypsin suggested that both colicin and microcin types
could be expected among untyped producer strains.
Some of these strains possibly produce already known,
though untested, colicin and microcin types (cloacin
DF13, pesticin and bacteriocin 28b, and microcins M,
E492, 24, D93). Despite this fact, untyped bacteriocin
producers represent an interesting set of E. coli strains
needing further bacteriocin research.

Page 6 of 10

Both our groups of control strains (taken from two
hospitals) were nearly equal in the incidence of bacteriocin types. Since the tributary areas of both hospitals
overlap, similarity in incidence of identified bacteriocin
types likely reflects the fact that all samples were taken
from persons living in the same area of South Moravia,
Czech Republic.
No statistically important difference was found in the
incidence of bacteriocin producers among UTI strains
(54.0% of producer strains) compared to control strains
(55.0%). This observation may reflect the fact that most
uropathogenic strains originate in the human gut [29].
Investigation of 568 clinical isolates of uropathogenic
strains of E. coli collected in New Zealand [30] revealed
lower incidence of bacteriocin producers (42.6%); an
even lower incidence (32.3%) was found among 440
E. coli UTI strains tested in 2001 in the Czech Republic
[1]. In the latter case, only “rich media” were used for
identification of bacteriocin producers, which could
result in lower microcin detection in both UTI and control strains (34.8% of control strains were found to be
colicinogenic in our study).
Commensal strains of E. coli belong mainly to phylogroups A and B1 whereas the group B2 contains
highly virulent E. coli strains [31]. Virulent E. coli strains
are also often found in group D. E. coli strains in groups
B2 and D have the largest genomes [32]. However, there
is no exclusive link between E. coli groups B2 and D
and the ability to cause infection since E. coli strains
belonging to all groups can cause infection under specific conditions. The observed higher incidence of E. coli
group B2 among UTI strains, relative to group A, is
therefore not surprising. We found that microcin H47
encoding genes are present predominantly in E. coli
phylogenetic group B2. Since microcin H47 encoding
determinants are localized on a bacterial chromosome
[33], microcin H47 (and microcin M) genes appears to
be often part of genetic elements specific for group B2
[27]. Our findings also suggest that colicin production is
principally associated with E. coli phylogroup A (and to
lesser extent with group D) and not with genotype B2,
where microcin producers are more common. As suggested in previous publications [13,34], our results support the model where the colicin producer phenotype,
within the Enterobacteriaceae family, belongs primarily
to commensal intestinal E. coli strains.
We found a statistically significant increase in UTI
strains producing colicin E1 compared to controls
(22.1% and 10.2%, respectively). There was an especially
strong association between triple and multiple bacteriocin producers and colicin E1 production - with p-values
lower than 0.0005. In a previously published paper [35],
ColE1-like plasmids were frequently found among uropathogenic strains of E. coli (UPEC). However, no

Šmajs et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:288
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/288

control group was tested to identify the statistical significance of this finding. Among 89 identified bacteriocin
producers, 43% were positive for mobA-, rom- and
RNAII-specific sequences [35]; also, since other colicin
plasmids may contain the same or highly similar
sequences to pColE1 (e.g. pColU) [36], the exact extent
of the colicin E1 producing subset is unknown. Based
on frequency of incidences of colicin E1 production in
our study, the majority of producer strains described by
Rijavec et al. [35] containing ColE1-like sequences were
probably strains harboring pColE1.
In the group of UTI strains, lower bacteriocin diversity
and an increased number of triple and multiple producers were identified. The bacteriocin multi-producer
phenotype of UTI strains was predicted as one possible
explanation of unidentified colicin types in a previous
study [30]. In general, the multi-producer phenotypes
require: (i) efficient genetic transfer within the bacterial
community, (ii) low habitat heterogeneity to ensure
effective negative selection of sensitive bacteria, and (iii)
relatively low bacteriocin biosynthesis costs. As experimentally shown by Braude and Siemienski [37] in rats,
the first two conditions apply to urinary tract infections
suggesting that the multi-producer phenotype is favored
among UPEC strains. Besides reduced habitat heterogeneity of the urinary tract compared to the human colon,
the multi-producer strains could be more frequently
found in UTI infections because of additional virulence
factors associated with bacteriocin encoding determinants. Although the first explanation may also apply to
the higher incidence of colicin E1 plasmids in the UTI,
it is unlikely that there are any additional virulence
determinants on pColE1 plasmids besides the colicin E1
determinant itself. The size of previously published
ColE1 plasmids varied from 5.2 kb [14] to 9 kb in the
E. fergusonii EF3 strain [38] and contained regions
important for plasmid replication, mobilization, and for
colicin synthesis. No known virulence determinants
have been identified on these plasmids. As shown previously, colicin E1 can kill both normal and cancer
eukaryotic cells and this effect has been shown to be
cell-specific [39,40]. The toxic effect of colicin E1 on
uroepithelial cells could be one of the potential virulence mechanisms found in UPEC strains.
When compared to controls, producer strains with the
combination of colicins Ia, E1, and mV were more common in the UTI group. As shown by Jeziorowski and
Gordon [28], when colicin Ia and microcin V occur
together, they are encoded on the same conjugative
plasmid as a result of integration of the microcin V
operon and several other genes into the pColIa plasmid.
Therefore we tested whether similar integration of colicin E1 genes into the pColIa could explain the observed
association of colicin E1 and colicin Ia synthesis. Among

Page 7 of 10

the 12 randomly picked colicin E1-synthesizing multiproducers, all strains contained pColE1 DNA that was
not recognized by the probe complementary to the colicin Ia-encoding DNA and vice versa, suggesting that
pColE1 was independently co-associated with pColIa in
UTI strains. Moreover, pColE1 sizes were similar to
those published previously (5.2 kb, [14]; 9 kb, [38]) indicating that the pColE1 DNA is unlikely to encode any
known virulence factor. This finding suggests that colicin E1 itself is a potential virulence factor of certain uropathogenic strains of E. coli. However, it is possible that
strains carrying colicin E1 genes differ in their genetic
content and contain elements promoting their urovirulence. Since it is known that colicin E1 is independently
associated with E. coli phylogroups [26], the first explanation appears more probable.

Conclusions
E. coli strains isolated from human urinary tract infections showed increased incidence of microcin H47 and
colicin E1 production, respectively, and belonged more
often to phylogroup B2 when compared to control
E. coli strains. In the UTI group, producers of 3 or
more identified bacteriocin types were more common.
Moreover, the incidence of colicin E1 production was
high in the UTI multi-producer bacteriocinogenic
strains. Unlike colicin Ia- and microcin V-encoding
determinants [28], pColE1 was independently associated
with pColIa in the UTI strains. Thus, colicin E1 itself
appears to be a potentially important virulence factor of
certain uropathogenic strains of E. coli.
Methods
Bacterial strains

Altogether, 772 human E. coli strains were isolated
between May 2007 and June 2009, from both male and
female patients. Five hundred and fifty-nine strains were
collected from the Faculty Hospital Bohunice, Brno, CZ,
including 361 E. coli strains isolated from urinary tract
infections (UTI) and 198 E. coli strains isolated from
feces of patients without bacterial gut infections (control
commensal strains). Additional 213 strains of E. coli
(isolated from feces of patients without bacterial gut
infections) were collected from the St. Ann’s Faculty
Hospital, Brno, CZ. Out of 411 E. coli control strains
(190 of male and 221 of female origin), only 92 (22.4%)
stemmed from patients with primary diagnoses related
to the gastrointestinal system (e.g. pancreatitis, dyspepsia
etc.) and none were isolated from cases with detectable
bacterial intestinal infection. Since no statistically significant differences in the incidence of producer strains or
the incidence of individual bacteriocin types between
control groups from both hospitals were found, strains
from both groups were merged and treated as a single

group. UTI strains were isolated from 85 males and 276
females. Bacterial identification of E. coli was performed
using a set of biochemical reactions (ENTEROtest 16,
PLIVA-Lachema Diagnostika, Czech Republic). All
donors of investigated strains were Caucasians living in
the South Moravia region of the Czech Republic. For
each sample, the primary diagnosis of the source patient
was established by an experienced clinician.
A described set of E. coli indicator strains was used to
identify the colicin and microcin types produced: E. coli
K12-Row, C6 (j), B1, P400, and Shigella sonnei 17 [1];
additionally, one recently verified indicator strain, E. coli
S40, was also used [41]. Together, these indicator strains
are capable of detecting all known colicin types including colicin L (P400) and colicin Js (S.s. 17).
Control bacterial producers encoding different colicin
types were taken from laboratory stock and comprised E.
coli BZB2101pColA - CA31, BZB2102 pColB - K260,
BZB2103 pColD - CA23, BZB2107 pColE4 - CT9,

BZB2120 pColE7 - K317, BZB2279 pColIa - CA53,
BZB2202 ColIb - P9, BZB2116 pColK - K235, PAP1
pColM - BZBNC22, BZB2123 pColN - 284 (original
source: A. P. Pugsley), E. coli 189BM pColE2 - P9 (B. A. D.
Stocker), E. coli 385/80 pColE1, pColV (H. Lhotová), E.
coli 185M4 pColE3 - CA38 (P. Fredericq), E. coli W3110
pColE8, W3110 pColE9 (J. R. James), E. coli K-12 pColS4
(D. Šmajs), S. boydii M592 (serovar 8) pColU (V. Horák),
E. coli K339 pColY (D. Friedman), Shigella sonnei (colicinotype 7) pColJs (J. Šmarda), E. coli pCol5 and E. coli
pCol10 (H. Pilsl). As microcin control producers, the following bacterial strains were used: E. coli 449/82 pColX
(microcin B17); E. coli 313/66 pColG (microcin H47); E.
coli 363/79 pColV (microcin V, original source: H. Lhotová); E. coli TOP10F’ pDS601 (microcin C7); E. coli D55/
1 (microcin J25); E. coli B1239 (microcin L, D. Šmajs).
Cultivation conditions

The ability to produce bacteriocins of all the strains was
tested in parallel on 4 different agar plates containing (i)
TY medium, (ii) nutrient broth, (iii) TY medium supplemented with mitomycin C, and (iv) TY medium supplemented with trypsin. The rich TY medium consisted of
yeast extract (Hi-Media, Mumbai, India) 5 gl-1, tryptone
(Hi-Media) 8 gl -1 , sodium chloride 5 gl -1 ; the TY agar
consisted of a base layer (1.5%, w/v, solid agar) and a top
layer (0.7%, w/v, soft agar). As a relatively unenriched
medium, a Difco™nutrient broth (Difco Laboratories,
Sparks, MD) 8 gl-1, NaCl 5 gl-1, was used for 1.5% (w/v)
agar plates. For induction of colicin production, the base
agar layer was supplemented with 0.01% (w/v) mitomycin
C. To test protease sensitivity of the inhibitive agents,
0.1% (w/v) trypsin was added to the base layer of agar.

Detection of colicin producers

The agar plates were inoculated by needle stab with
fresh broth cultures and the plates were incubated at
37°C for 48 hours. The bacteria were then killed using
chloroform vapors and each plate was then overlaid
with a thin layer of soft agar containing 107 cells ml-1
of an indicator strain. The plates were then incubated
at 37°C overnight. All 772 E. coli strains of clinical origin were tested on four parallel plates against all 6
indicators, i.e. each strain underwent 24 individual
tests.
Identification of colicin and microcin types and
determination of E. coli phylogenetic group

Identification of individual colicin types (colicins A, B,
D, E1-E9, Ia, Ib, Js, K, M, N, S4, U, Y, 5 and 10) was
performed using PCR with primers designed using the
Primer3 program [42] or with previously published primers [26]. The list of primer pairs and the corresponding length of PCR products are listed in Additional file
1. Total bacterial DNA was isolated using DNAzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 100-fold dilution, this DNA
was used as a template for PCR reactions. Alternatively,
all producer strains were tested with colony PCR. A bacterial colony was picked with a sterile inoculation loop
and resuspended in 100 μl of autoclaved water. For each
individual PCR reaction, 1 μl of cell suspension was
added to the reaction. The PCR detection protocol was
as follows: 94°C (2 minutes); 94°C (30 seconds), 60°C
(30 seconds), 72°C (1 minute), 30 cycles; 72°C (7 minutes). For DNA amplification directly performed from
lysed whole cells (colony PCR), the initial step was
extended to 5 minutes (94°C, 5 minutes). All primers
detecting colicins were tested against all type producers
to reveal potential cross-reactivity of sequentially similar
colicin genes. The primer sequences for PCR detection
of microcins B17, H47, J25, L, and V, respectively, were
taken from previously published paper [26]. With the
exception of microcin M, all bacteriocin genes detected
in the study performed by Gordon and O’Brien [26]
were analyzed in this work. Moreover, 12 additional
bacteriocin genes were detected by us. PCR products
resulting from detection of sequentially related colicin
genes (colicins E2-E9, Ia-Ib, U-Y, and 5-10, respectively)
were subjected to dideoxyterminator sequencing using
amplification primers. Because of sensitivity of microcin
H47 to chloroform vapours, all investigated strains were
tested for the presence of microcin H47-encoding genes.
Sequence analysis was performed using Lasergene software (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI). The phylogenetic
group of each E. coli strain was determined using the
triplex PCR protocol described previously [27].

Statistical analyses

Statistical significance of the incidence of genotypes and
colicin or microcin types, in both strain groups, was
performed by applying standard methods derived from
the binomial distribution, including the two-tailed test.
STATISTICA version 8.0 (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, USA) was
used for statistical calculations. Alternatively, an interactive calculation tool for chi-square tests of “goodness of
fit” and independence was used for the calculation of
statistical significance of obtained results [43].
Southern blot analyses and XL-PCR

The total plasmid DNA of selected colicin producers
were isolated using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit and
QIAGEN Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany),
respectively. During isolation of plasmid DNA, manufacturer’s recommendations were followed. The plasmid
DNA was digested with the EcoRI restriction endonuclease (New England Biolabs, Ipswitch, MA) and the
undigested and digested total plasmid DNA was transferred to the Hybond-XL membrane by a standard capillary method (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK). The
colicin E1 and Ia probes used in Southern blot analysis
were amplified from the control producer strains with
primers used for detection of colicin genes (Additional
file 1). The probes were labelled with the Gene Images
AlkPhos Direct Labelling and Detection System (Amersham) and the labelled hybridized probes were detected
with the ECF chemifluorescent substrate and the
Typhoon imager (Amersham) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
The GeneAmp® XL PCR Kit (Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ, USA) was used for amplification
of pColE1 plasmid DNA using pColE1-seq1 (5’ GCCGATCGTGATGCTATTTT - 3’) and pColE1-seq2
(5’ - AAAATAGCATCACGATCGGC - 3’) complementary primers recognizing colicin E1 operon.
