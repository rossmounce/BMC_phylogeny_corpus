Abstract
Background: The genomic organisation of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) varies
greatly between different vertebrates. In mammals, the classical MHC consists of a large number of
linked genes (e.g. greater than 200 in humans) with predominantly immune function. In some birds,
it consists of only a small number of linked MHC core genes (e.g. smaller than 20 in chickens)
forming a minimal essential MHC and, in fish, the MHC consists of a so far unknown number of
genes including non-linked MHC core genes. Here we report a survey of MHC genes and their
paralogues in the zebrafish genome.
Results: Using sequence similarity searches against the zebrafish draft genome assembly (Zv4,
September 2004), 149 putative MHC gene loci and their paralogues have been identified. Of these,
41 map to chromosome 19 while the remaining loci are spread across essentially all chromosomes.
Despite the fragmentation, a set of MHC core genes involved in peptide transport, loading and
presentation are still found in a single linkage group.
Conclusion: The results extend the linkage information of MHC core genes on zebrafish
chromosome 19 and show the distribution of the remaining MHC genes and their paralogues to be
genome-wide. Although based on a draft genome assembly, this survey demonstrates an essentially
fragmented MHC in zebrafish.

Background
The human Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is
a gene-dense region on chromosome 6p21.3, and comprises a group of genes that are involved functionally with
the adaptive and innate immune system. From centromere to telomere, it is divided into five regions: extended
class II, classical class II, class III, classical class I and
extended class I. The classical MHC contains 224 genes,
many of which are pseudogenes, and with every two in
five expressed genes having a potential immune function
and a role in disease resistance [1], this region has become

a focal locus in comparative genomics. Antibody and T
cell mediated immune responses against invading pathogens are initiated through MHC class I and class II molecules [2]. These main components are not only missing
from invertebrates, but are also not present in primitive
jawless fish, such as hagfish and lamprey [3]. MHC class I
and II molecules do, however, exist in all jawed vertebrates, including the cartilaginous fish. The gene loci in
the class III region encode a variety of proteins with both
immune and non-immune functions [4].

Genomic sequences encompassing the MHC are currently
available for human, chimpanzee, macaque, rat, mouse,
cat, pig, horse, quail, chicken, frog, teleost fish and shark
[5]. While the genomic architecture of the mammalian
MHC is conserved, the number of genes between species
can differ greatly. In birds, for example, the minimal
essential MHC in chicken consists of 19 genes [6] while
gene duplications have expanded this region in quail [7]
and sparrows [8]. The linkage of class I, II, and III region

genes can be traced back to cartilaginous fish, which are
the earliest jawed vertebrates known to have diverged
from a common ancestor with humans [9]. MHC loci,
however, do not always exist in a single tightly linked cluster as generally observed in mammals. A large scale inversion has separated the class IIB cluster from the MHClinked class IIA cluster in cattle [10]. The class I and class
II loci in zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) are found on different chromosomes [11,12]. A similar organisation is

Map of major histocompatibility genes and their paralogues in zebrafish (not to scale). Only chromosomes and two unmapped
contigs (NA17761 and NA17767) that harbour MHC-related genes are shown. Orthologues or paralogues of human MHC
class I region genes are shown in red, of class II region genes in blue, and class III region genes in green. Genes with the suffix
"L" for like are either gene fragments and/or highly similar to their human counterparts. Genes that have more than one copy
in the genome are shown by a greater than (>) symbol. Similarities and differences between the whole-genome assembly and
mapping information present in the ZFIN database are shown by plus (+) and minus (-) signs, respectively. The core MHC has
been compiled from five genomic clones spanning this region [EMBL:AL672216, EMBL:AL672151, EMBL:AL672164,

present in trout, stickleback, common guppy and cichlid
fish [13,14]. This observation demonstrates that the separation of the MHC class I and class II loci is characteristic
of teleost fish, which represent half of all vertebrates. Since
the genes of the immune system were present in the common ancestor of tetrapods and teleosts, the differences in
their genomic organisation may be the result of lineagespecific chromosomal events such as duplications, inversions, deletions and translocations.
The genome of the zebrafish is currently being sequenced
at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. The availability of

sequence data will allow an insight into the understanding and evolution of the immune system in fish. To date,
small regions containing major histocompatibility genes
have been mapped by radiation hybrid mapping and
sequencing of select genomic clones [15,16]. With the
ongoing whole-genome sequencing efforts and the compilation of physical maps, it is now possible to examine
larger genomic regions and assess the degree of shared
synteny between mammals and fish on a genome-wide
scale. Here we have utilised a comprehensive wholegenome shotgun assembly data set to fully analyse the
zebrafish loci that are related to the human MHC. The

human genome contains at least three regions that are
paralogous to the MHC [17]. These are thought to be the
result of two rounds of duplications that occurred early
during vertebrate evolution. In this study, we examine the
genome-wide distribution of paralogous genes in
zebrafish.

Results and Discussion
Analysis of the MHC class I region in zebrafish
The MHC class I region in human embodies gene clusters
coding for HLA class I molecules, histones, solute carriers,
vomeronasal receptors, olfactory receptors and zinc fingers [18]. These clusters have undergone a large-scale
expansion and each has paralogues throughout the
genome. Ten representative members of the extended
class I region, which are expressed and have paralogues in
the human genome, and more than 30 genes that reside

in the classical class I region were chosen for this analysis
(Table 1). Genes that were excluded from this study
included pseudogenes, zinc fingers with the tripartite
motif (TRIM), and RING finger proteins. Approximately
half of the human genes were identified in the zebrafish
whole-genome assembly, predominantly on chromosome 19. Because multigene families evolve by a birthand-death process [19], orthologous genes are usually difficult to identify through sequence similarity searches.
Chromosome 19 harbours the largest number of MHC
genes in zebrafish (Figure 1). The core region, comprising
genes encoding the classical peptide presenting class I
molecules (mhc1uea, mhc1uaa, mhc1ufa, mhc1uda), proteasome subunits (psmb8, psmb9a, psmb11, psmb10), ATPbinding cassettes (abcb3, abcb3l1, abcb3l2) and tapasin
(tpsn), cluster tightly together and span approximately

175 kb of DNA. Over 5 Mb downstream of these loci are
several other genes that span the human MHC region,
although these are not all found adjacent to each other. In
humans, MHC class I molecules are expressed on the surface of most cells and are recognized by CD8+ cytotoxic T
cells. They are heterodimers composed of an alpha subunit, encoded by the MHC, and a beta subunit, or b-2
microglobulin (B2M), which maps to chromosome
15q21–q22.2. In zebrafish too, the b2m gene is found
located in a different part of the genome on chromosome
13. Previously unmapped class I ZE lineage genes [20] and
novel MHC class I antigen fragments have been identified
on chromosome 1 and scaffold 1723. The additional
functional class I lineage (mhc1ze) is also present in two
other cyprinids (carp and barbus), and not linked to other
class I and II genes.
Analysis of the MHC class II region in zebrafish
MHC class II molecules are heterodimers comprising A
(alpha) and B (beta) chains that present peptides to CD4+
T cells via the endosomal pathway. One class IIA
(mhc2daa) and six class IIB (mhc2dab, mhc2dbb,
mhc2dcb, mhc2ddb, mhc2deb, mhc2dfb) genes have previously been identified by screening a zebrafish genomic
BAC library [21]. Only the mhc2dab and mhc2daa genes
are known to be expressed [22]. They are closely linked
and were identified on chromosome 8 (Table 2). Analysis
of approximately 1 Mb of contiguous DNA surrounding
the functional class II region in zebrafish demonstrates
the presence of 23 flanking genes mapping to various
human chromosomal locations, including two or more
genes mapping to human 6q (C6orf117, LOC557721,
ppil4), 12q (slc15a4, KIAA1944), 20q (rnpc2, slc12a5),
22q (slc7a4, sf3a1) and Xp (pqbp1l, t541, jarid1c). The
lack of genes mapping to the human MHC, in addition to
the low gene density of this region, indicates that the functional zebrafish class II region is the result of a translocation event [12].

Mapping to chromosome 19, approximately 22 Mb telomeric of the class I region, is the class IIB gene mhc2dcb-rs
(Q95HJ7), with a similar sequence on contig NA4006.
Also within this segment of DNA there are two predicted
class IIA chain-encoding gene fragments, consisting of
only the alpha2 domain and cytoplasmic tail-encoding
parts. It is therefore unlikely that this locus is functional.
Assuming that these gene fragments are not due to errors
in the whole-genome assembly, it is evidence for a linkage
of remnants of MHC-related class II genes with the core
MHC region containing the class I peptide presenting
genes.
Previously identified mhc2dbb and mhc2dfb genes are predicted to be located in currently unmapped contigs,
NA14232 and scaffold 2399. However, mhc2deb (found in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/152

clone U08874) was not identified in the current assembly,
and may be attributed to gaps in the sequence data or
allelic or haplotypic differences. Several fragmented
sequences resembling class IIA and/or B chain-encoding
genes were also identified in contigs NA17244 and
NA15003, and chromosomes 5, 15 and 20. Only contig
NA6696 harbours putative complete class IIA and class IIB
genes. Another gene found in this 15 kb contig resembles
mhc2ddb, consisting of exons 3 and 4 only.
The two TAP transporters in human, namely TAP1 and
TAP2, are both located in the MHC class II region, and are
closely linked to genes encoding the proteasome subunits
and the class II molecules. In zebrafish, however, a TAP1like sequence is found on chromosomes 9 and three TAP2like genes are found in the class I region [15] on chromosome 19. The latter, named abcb3, abcb3l1, abcb3l2, form
part of the zebrafish core MHC region. The trout tap1 gene
is not linked to the major class IA region either [23]. Likewise, in Fugu, the tap1 gene is found on an isolated scaffold that is not linked to the main class I region [24].
Analysis of the MHC class III region in zebrafish
The human class III is the most gene dense region within
the MHC containing few or no pseudogenes. Unlike the
class I and class II loci that are evolutionary and functionally related [25], the class III region genes are not. The
class III, however, include immune-related genes such as
those encoding complement components, tumour necrosis factors and heat shock proteins. The search for the
MHC class III region in zebrafish was first initiated by the
identification of the BF/C2 gene using degenerate PCR
[26]. This was then followed by the identification of several, but not all, of the zebrafish homologues of the
human MHC class III region genes [16].

In the zebrafish, the MHC class III genes are found distributed throughout their genome (Table 3). Several zebrafish
genes (zgc:63773, tnf, bat2-like, ck2b, ddah1, skiv2l,
C6orf31-like, ppt2, bat3-like) map to chromosome 19,
which also encompasses the largest stretch of MHCrelated genes. Two other unmapped scaffolds also harbour several class III genes: neu1, zgc:64108, bat8, zbtb12
are found in NA17767; and bf/c2, rdbp, hsp70, skiv2l are in
scaffold NA17761. These are syntenic to the human MHC
class III region with the conservation of both gene order
and content (Figure 1).
Approximately half of the human MHC class III region
genes were not identified in the zebrafish assembly.
Among these were the Ly6 family members, which may
therefore be mammalian-specific. Alternatively, being
involved in the immune response, Ly6 genes evolved
more rapidly than others, and might have diverged sufficiently to not be recognised by sequence similarity

searches. For eight human genes, ATP6V1G2, AIF1, CLIC1,
CREBL1, DDAH2, AGPAT1, PBX2 and NOTCH4, the paralogues but not the orthologues of the genes in the human
MHC class III region have been identified by sequence
similarity in zebrafish. This observation extends to IER3,
RING1 and B3GALT4 found in the class I and extended
class II regions. The presence or absence of other genes
may be attributed to lineage-specific evolution. For example, lamprey [27], zebrafish [26] and medaka [28] possess
genes equally similar to both mammalian BF and C2,
while a Xenopus clone has clearly been identified as
encompassing BF. This BF/C2 ancestral gene has further
duplicated in zebrafish [29], copies of which were identified on chromosome 21 and contig NA17761. Similarly,
a recent survey of hsp70 genes in Xiphophorus maculates
(platyfish) [30] has revealed that a single HSP70 gene gave
rise to four distinct groups of genes: mammalian testisspecific HST70, mammalian MHC-linked HSP70, mammalian HSP70B' and the fish HSP70. Human class III
HSPA1A, HSPA1B and HSPA1L genes are intronless and
encode identical or near-identical proteins. Intronless
zebrafish hsp70 genes were identified on chromosome 8
and scaffold NA17761. Three additional copies of HSP70like genes were identified on chromosome 3, although
these contained one, two or three introns in the 3' end of
their sequence. The identified zebrafish genes cluster phylogenetically within the fish subgroup, apart from the
sequence on scaffold NA17761, which appears to be similar to the mammalian MHC-linked heat shock protein
sequences (data not shown).
Construction of in-silico gene maps
The zebrafish MHC gene map (Figure 1) was constructed
using primarily mapping information from the wholegenome assembly displayed in the Ensembl platform. The
position of at least 49 genes mapped in this survey could
be verified by comparison to experimental data stored in
the ZFIN database, which also yielded information for
genes residing in unmapped contigs. Mapping data from
these two sources did not coincide for several genes,
including bat3, clica, vars2, c3, pou5f1, rgl2, tubb5,
ddx39, col11a1, pbx1a, and stk19-like. These discrepencies may be attributed to the high levels of polymorphisms and regions of misassembly caused by the source
DNA used for the whole-genome assembly being collected from over 1000 embryos. Until the genome
sequence is complete, it will not be possible to accurately
predict the position and number of all human MHC
orthologues in zebrafish. There are also a number of
genes, notably CD1, MOG and HFE, that could not be
identified in the draft assembly used here (these are listed
as 'not found' in Tables 1, 2, 3).

There were a number of difficulties associated with assessing the degree of synteny between the zebrafish whole-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/152

genome assembly and the human MHC. Although BLAST
is a heavily used analysis tool for identifying related
sequences, it does not discriminate between large gene
family members. To maximise the identification of MHCrelated loci in zebrafish, only the highest BLAST scoring
sequences were chosen for further analysis (many of
which were unique BLAST reciprocal hits), and searches
were conducted using blastp or tblastx. Orthology can be
confirmed by obtaining mapping data of surrounding
genes, with the assumption that groups of syntenic genes
would remain in close proximity through evolution, and
therefore be maintained in similar segments of DNA. The
physical linkage between numerous MHC-related loci is
apparent on zebrafish chromosome 19. Genes mapping
to zebrafish chromosome 5 have also been observed to be
syntenic with human chromosome 9 [31]. Gene blocks, in
particular present in contig NA17761 and NA17767, map
closely together in the human MHC class III region. This
criterion is more difficult to apply when genes are dispersed, as seen in Figure 1. The Ensembl platform [32]
used to map the MHC in zebrafish provides a combination of alignment data, genomic location, detailed transcript structures to compare functional domains of
orthologous proteins, in conjunction with multi-species
comparisons. In combination with further phylogenetic
analyses when duplicates of one gene were identified, the
distinction between orthologues and paralogues was
ascertained. Nevertheless, it is very difficult to assign
orthologous comparative relationships with multigene
families until all members of the family have been
sequenced in both organisms. This might be the case in
human, but the zebrafish genome is yet to be completed.
Duplicated genes and MHC paralagous regions
In human, it was observed that four regions, the MHC on
6p21.3 as well as 9q33–q34, 1q21–q25/1p11–p32 and
19p13.1–p13.4 are paralogous regions [33] that share
members of the same gene family. Further analysis has
shown that paralogues of human MHC genes are also scattered essentially over all chromosomes [18]. Likewise,
genome-wide duplications have recently been examined
in zebrafish [31], confirming that an extra round of a
whole-genome duplication event occurred early in the teleost lineage after it split from the tetrapod lineage. Evidence that paralogous genes exist in zebrafish became
apparent when many duplicates associated with the MHC,
and mainly the class III region, were identified (Figure 1).
Here we discuss five MHC-encoded gene families in more
detail.

The Notch gene family members encode evolutionary
transmembrane receptors that regulate cell fate determination. Four Notch paralogues (NOTCH1-4) have been
identified in human, and only three of their orthologues
are found in zebrafish (Table 3). The orthologue of

Page 7 of 10

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:152

human NOTCH4, found in the MHC, is absent in the fish
whole-genome assembly, indicative that gene loss has followed the block duplication events in teleosts. This is also
seen in Fugu [24] and may be due to it being the most
divergent member of the Notch family [34]. Two duplicates of notch3 are found in scaffolds 1523 and 285. Until
the assembly is complete, it is not clear whether there are
two copies of this gene or if this is due to the status of the
current assembly. Only one surrounding rdh8-like
sequence is found in common between the two scaffolds.
In addition, notch1 and notch2 have been mapped to chromosome 5 and contig NA15389.
Retinoid receptors are soluble nuclear proteins belonging
to the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily of
transcriptional regulators. The RXR subfamily consists of
three polypeptide chains, namely alpha, beta and gamma,
encoded by separate loci. The human RXRB gene is found
within the MHC, while the RXRA and RXRG paralogues
are located on chromosomes 9 and 1, respectively. Five rxr
loci have been identified in the zebrafish assembly in contig NA16779 and chromosomes 5, 9, 17 and 21. Two
semi-orthologues of human rxrb appear to have arisen
from a fish-specific duplication, and duplicates of rxra are
also present in the zebrafish genome. Mapping data from
the current assembly in comparison to the ZFIN linkage
maps are contradictory and may highlight problems in
both approaches to mapping genes. Interestingly, neither
of the rxrb sequences map to chromosome 19 in the Zv4
whole-genome assembly as originally thought [35].
The human PBX2 gene encodes a homeodomain-containing protein. Three paralogues are located within chromosomes 1q23, 9q33 and 19p12, named PBX1, PBX3 and
PBX4, respectively. Four PBX-like sequences were identified in the zebrafish: pbx1a on scaffold NA14559 and
chromosome 11; pbx3b on chromosome 18; and pbxy on
scaffold NA11844. These are related to human PBX1,
PBX3 and PBX4, respectively [36]. The orthologous
sequence to human PBX2, which is present in the MHC,
has not been identified in the current assembly.
The complement component C4 gene encodes a protein
that plays a central role in the innate immune response.
Structurally, C4, C5 and C3 belong to the α2 macroglobulin (A2M) protein family and are derived from a single
common ancestor. In human, they are found on four different chromosomes: 6p21 (C4), 9q33 (C5), 19p13 (C3)
and 12p13 (A2M), and a similar situation exists in all
tetrapods studied to date. In zebrafish, the a2m and c4
genes are both found on chromosome 15 as previously
shown [37]. Multiple copies of a2m have also been
observed in zebrafish with a duplicate being present in
NA17328. Two copies of the c3 gene were identified on
chromosome 22 and NA14479.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/152

Six members of the chloride intracellular channel (CLIC)
gene family (CLIC1–CLIC6) have been described in
humans. They are involved in chloride ion transport
within various subcellular compartments [38]. Four clic
genes were identified in zebrafish on chromosomes 14,
16, 17 and 18. On phylogenetic analysis, they cluster with
mammalian CLIC2, CLIC3, CLIC4 and CLIC5 genes,
respectively. The orthologue of the human MHC-embedded CLIC1 was not found.

Conclusion
Comparative genomics reveals that the organisation of the
MHC in more distantly-related organisms varies from the
human model [39]. Teleost fish are particularly unusual
in their organisation in comparison to mammals,
chicken, Xenopus and shark in that their class I and class
II loci are found on different chromosomes [14]. The core
class I region in zebrafish, medaka, Fugu and rainbow
trout [13,40-42] comprises genes involved in class I peptide presentation and processing: the classical class I molecules, the immunoproteasome subunits, ATP-binding
cassette transporters and tapasin. The whole-genome
shotgun data for zebrafish has allowed a genome-wide
analysis of major histocompatibility genes and their paralogues, and highlights that one or more copies exist of
MHC-related genes in fish as in humans. The results
obtained thus far extend the linkage information regarding major histocompatibility genes on chromosome 19 in
zebrafish and the classical mammalian MHC, and further
supports previous findings that the functional class II loci
are found on a different chromosome. The distribution of
the remaining MHC-related genes and their paralogues is
genome-wide, confirming a fragmented MHC in fish.

Methods
The genome of the zebrafish is currently being sequenced
at the Sanger Institute [43]. The analysis was carried out
on the fourth Ensembl whole-genome assembly Zv4,
released on September 2004 [32]. This assembly integrates the whole-genome shotgun assembly with data
from the physical map [44]. Protein sequences encoded in
117 human MHC genes were chosen for BLAST sequence
similarity searches against the zebrafish Ensembl assembly. Previously identified MHC-related zebrafish cDNAs
[45] were also used in the analysis. Gene annotations were
verified using VEGA [46]. A number of potentially duplicated genes were identified. Their predicted amino acid
sequences were then aligned with other vertebrate gene
family members present in the UniProt database [47]
using CLUSTAL [48], and the multiple sequence alignments were used for phylogenetic analysis by the neighbour joining method [49] via the PHYLO_WIN interface
[50]. Official gene symbols assigned by the Zebrafish
Nomenclature Committee (ZNC) and HUGO Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) have been used in the annota-

tion. Zebrafish and human gene names are given in lower
and upper case, respectively.

The zebrafish source DNA for the whole-genome assembly was acquired from approximately 1000 five day old
embryos. This has resulted in possible misassemblies due
to polymorphisms between sequences, different haplotypes, and difficulties with the assembly of duplicated
genes and regions, in particular with many highly homologous MHC genes that have arisen by duplication. Where
possible, finished clones [e.g. EMBL:AL672216,
EMBL:AL672151, EMBL:AL672185, EMBL:AL672164,
EMBL:AL672176] were used to study the short-range linkage of genes in preference to the Ensembl whole-genome
assembly. Alternative mapping information, for comparison and validity of the in-silico approach used during this
study, was obtained from the Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN) [45] and published scientific literature.
