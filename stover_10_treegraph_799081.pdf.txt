Abstract
Background: Today it is common to apply multiple potentially conflicting data sources to a given
phylogenetic problem. At the same time, several different inference techniques are routinely
employed instead of relying on just one. In view of both trends it is becoming increasingly important
to be able to efficiently compare different sets of statistical values supporting (or conflicting with)
the nodes of a given tree topology, and merging this into a meaningful representation. A tree editor
supporting this should also allow for flexible editing operations and be able to produce ready-topublish figures.
Results: We developed TreeGraph 2, a GUI-based graphical editor for phylogenetic trees
(available from http://treegraph.bioinfweb.info). It allows automatically combining information from
different phylogenetic analyses of a given dataset (or from different subsets of the dataset), and
helps to identify and graphically present incongruences. The program features versatile editing and
formatting options, such as automatically setting line widths or colors according to the value of any
of the unlimited number of variables that can be assigned to each node or branch. These node/
branch data can be imported from spread sheets or other trees, be calculated from each other by
specified mathematical expressions, filtered, copied from and to other internal variables, be kept
invisible or set visible and then be freely formatted (individually or across the whole tree). Beyond
typical editing operations such as tree rerooting and ladderizing or moving and collapsing of nodes,
whole clades can be copied from other files and be inserted (along with all node/branch data and
legends), but can also be manually added and, thus, whole trees can quickly be manually constructed
de novo. TreeGraph 2 outputs various graphic formats such as SVG, PDF, or PNG, useful for tree
figures in both publications and presentations.
Conclusion: TreeGraph 2 is a user-friendly, fully documented application to produce ready-topublish trees. It can display any number of annotations in several ways, and permits easily importing
and combining them. Additionally, a great number of editing- and formatting-operations is available.

Background
It has become standard to apply multiple inference techniques to a given phylogenetic problem. The recent inva-

sion of phylogenetics by Bayesian techniques (e.g., [1]),
the ever improving models and algorithms for tree
searches under maximum likelihood (e.g., [2,3]), and the

continuously growing processor speed helped these previously computationally very expensive approaches to
become a typical component of most phylogenetic studies, accompanying the widespread parsimony and distance-based approaches. At the same time, no single
inference technique has consistently proven to be the single best choice. Accordingly, the researcher is well-advised
to explore potential method-specific differential results,
leaving him or her with the difficulty of visualizing these
differences for him- or herself and for the reader. Frequently, differences are restricted to the magnitude of various measures of statistical support (such as jackknife and
bootstrap proportions, Bayesian posterior probabilities),
rather than being apparent from the topology. In addition, the frequently reported results from topological tests
(e.g., [4]) or tracing of ancestral character states (e.g., [5])
add further importance to being able to assign a variety of
numbers and graphical labels to tree nodes.
To address those needs, the first version of TreeGraph [6]
had been developed, which strongly simplifies the creation of the final tree figure by the automatic positioning
and formatting of multiple labels per branch. However,
while one support type could directly be imported from
the phylogeny inference program output, the Newick- and
Nexus [7] format used by these programs precluded the
direct import of more branch labels. For all additional
labels (support values), the laborious work of mapping
them onto the appropriate nodes remained. The cumbersome drawing part of the publication process was minimized, but it remained the user's responsibility to collect
and position all information that was to be displayed at
the nodes.
We figured that automating this process would be very
useful, particularly so in studies of extensive gene family
datasets that may contain several hundred terminals.
Gene family studies using phylogenetic approaches have
become a major focus with the increasing amount of
available fully sequenced genomes. Typically, gene family
trees suffer from weak support [8-10]. The entailed caution required when interpreting gene family trees
increases the need for testing alternative inference methods, alignment methods, data partitions, and varying
treatment of questionable alignment regions.
Similarly, the differential contribution of and potential
conflict among different data partitions is frequently estimated by the differential success of resolution and degree
of statistical support in various parts of the tree contributed by each partition [11]. This has become particularly
important since multigene analysis are the rule rather
than the exception, a trend further fueled by the growing
availability of complete (organellar) genomes that provide easy access to a large number of genes that can be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/7

concatenated in large data matrices and then subjected to
phylogenetic analyses, e.g. [12].
These trends call for a tree editor that is able to compare
and ultimately visualize congruent and conflicting evidence from different analyses, while guaranteeing flexible
editing and production of high-quality tree figures for
publications.

Implementation
TreeGraph 2 is written in Java and uses Swing for its
graphical user interface (GUI) as well as the Apache Batik
SVG Toolkit (http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/), FreeHEP (http://java.freehep.org/), Java Math Expression
Parser (http://sourceforge.net/projects/jep/) and BrowserLauncher
(http://browserlaunch2.sourceforge.net/)
libraries. Besides its GUI, which makes editing and formatting very intuitive, the current version 2 adds many
features previously unavailable in the command line precursor and introduces an XML-based native file format
(XTG).

Results and Discussion
Importing data
TreeGraph 2 can read trees in Newick or Nexus format
(including additional annotations in comments specified
by BEAST [13]) as well as phyloXML tree descriptions [14]
and can furthermore import annotations from text files
generated e.g. with a spreadsheet application. Besides
that, TreeGraph 2 facilitates combining information from
different phylogenetic analyses of a given dataset. This is
particularly useful e.g. in the study of extensive gene family datasets with large sets of terminals. The following sections describe this feature in greater detail.
Mapping statistical support onto congruent nodes
For each branch of a tree opened in TreeGraph 2, the corresponding support from other trees can be mapped
whenever the topology defined by the current branch is
present in them. Each of these other trees may represent
the result from a different analytical approach or different
data partition, and support values from these trees are
assigned their own label ID by which they are grouped
and amenable to future formatting or editing operations.
Thus, all support values that stem from a particular analysis can be individually formatted e.g. by their relative position on the branch and/or their font and style.
Finding conflicting nodes and mapping contradictory support
In some studies not only the support from different analyses has been mapped onto the branches but also the
strongest support for a contradictory topology was determined by inspection via eye [15,16].

BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:7

TreeGraph 2 uses the following algorithm automate this
(for a better understanding it should be kept in mind that
each branch splits a tree into exactly two subtrees).
Let tree1 specify the topology onto which contradictory
support from other trees should be mapped (example in
Figure 1a). For a given branch branch1 in tree1, the maximum support for a conflicting branch branch2 from
another tree tree2 (example in Figure 1b) can be found as
follows.
1. Find the branch2 which defines a subtree subtree2
with the smallest number of terminals that contains
all leafs of a subtree subtree1 defined by branch1.
2. Inside subtree2 find all branches that define a subtree which are on the one hand fully enclosed by
subtree2 and on the other hand contain at least one terminal which is also part of subtree1 as well as at least
one leaf which is not.
3. The highest support value in the set of these
branches is added as a conflicting value onto branch1.
This highest conflicting support value can be distinguished from congruent values by user-specified formats,
e.g. brackets, asterisks or different colors (see example in
Figure 1).
Editing and formatting capabilities
The program features versatile editing and formatting
options, such as automatically setting branch widths or
colors according to the value of any of the unlimited

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/7

number of variables that can be assigned to each node or
branch.
Editing of node/branch data
Node/branch data imported from spread sheets or other
trees (as described above), can be copied from and to
other internal variables, be kept invisible or set visible and
then be freely formatted (individually or across the whole
tree), filtered according to their values or calculated from
each other using an integrated mathematical expression
parser which can access all node/branch data columns.
Figure 2 shows a screenshot displaying a tree and its corresponding data table.
Editing operations
Beyond typical editing operations such as tree rerooting
and ladderizing or moving and collapsing of nodes,
whole clades can be copied or cut out and placed into new
empty files or inserted (along with all node/branch data)
into other trees. Since nodes can also be manually added,
whole trees can quickly be manually constructed starting
from an empty file.

The editing operations are facilitated by versatile additive
selection options that allow selecting many elements in a
tree for subsequent formatting with just a few clicks. Additionally, every operation applied to an opened tree can be
easily undone or redone using the undo-function.
Searching, replacing and translating tree leaf names
Searching and replacing is possible across all node/branch
data columns (including taxon names and node labels).

Merging support values from different analyses - a simple contrived case. The tree on the left (a) was first opened in
TreeGraph 2 and defines the topology and optionally a first set of support values. (Alternatively a consensus tree of all analyses
or any user-defined tree could be used here.) Afterwards the annotations from another tree (b) have been added which
resulted in a new group of values (c) supporting (green) or contradicting (red) the initially loaded topology (blue).

Figure
Example2view of the TreeGraph 2 GUI showing taxon counts displayed as branch widths
Example view of the TreeGraph 2 GUI showing taxon counts displayed as branch widths. The taxon counts of all
terminal nodes have been imported from a table (text file) to a hidden node data column. The imported annotations have then
been used as source data to set the terminal branch widths. For each TreeGraph 2 document, one can optionally view the
node/branch data table in the right part of the document window as shown here.

More restrictive alignment file formats do not allow
lengthy taxon names, so names get truncated. In other
cases, the often clumsy taxon- or lab IDs used during a
study survive up to the final alignment, phylogenetic dataset and the trees constructed from it until they need to be
adjusted for the final tree to be presented in a paper. TreeGraph 2 can be requested to apply a translation table to
use "cleaned" taxon names for the final output. This translation table can be constructed easily with help of the data
export feature and any text editor or spread sheet program.
Furthermore the lab IDs (old terminal names) can be
saved in a hidden data field to be able to identify the terminals by these lab IDs so that additional support values
could still be added later on.

Formatting document elements
Great flexibility is offered by the application as it allows
free formatting of line- and text-formats of all document
elements like nodes, branches or legends (which mark a
group of terminals). Additionally branches can carry an
unlimited number of textual annotations (text labels) or
icons (icon labels) the color, text style or size of which can
also be freely formatted (see Figure 3). All distance values
in TreeGraph 2 (e.g. line width or text height) are specified
in millimeters or DTP-points (1/72 inch). This feature,
along with the image export function (see below), allows
the user to design trees in exactly the size they should
appear in print or in the exported graphic file. In addition,
TreeGraph 2 offers a feature to proportionally rescale all
elements of a subtree or the whole document.

Figure 3
Displaying multiple annotations and assigning element formats automatically
Displaying multiple annotations and assigning element formats automatically. The tree in this contrived example
contains several annotations including ancestral divergence times (node heights; expressed as branch lengths in an ultrametric
tree), DNA substitution rates, posterior clade probabilities as they could have been imported by TreeGraph 2 from, e.g., a tree
file generated with help of TreeAnnotator after a BEAST analysis. As in a typical chronogram view, the age of the nodes (in million years ago) is expressed by the scale bar at the bottom. In addition, TreeGraph 2 was asked to automatically assign branch
widths and line colors to illustrate the mean evolutionary rates for each branch, while the accuracy of each rate estimate was
illustrated by a filled rectangular label icon above and an unfilled one below each branch (the branch width extended by the size
of the upper icon describes the highest rate in e.g. a 95% confidence interval and the branch width reduced by the size of the
lower icon describes the lowest rate in the interval). Text labels have been used to show the posterior clade probabilities
(above the branches, bold) and the absolute substitution rates in substitutions per site per billion years (below the branches).
Furthermore, this example tree contains star and cross icon labels that could be used, e.g., to highlight specific character state
transitions (such as orange stars indicating "number to character" shifts (filled) or vice versa (not filled), and blue crosses representing "upper case to lower case" shifts).

Automatically setting line width, text height, and color
TreeGraph 2 allows automatically setting all formats (e.g.
branch widths, branch colors, text colors, text heights,
icon sizes) according to the value of a chosen node/
branch data column. This provides a very intuitive way to
graphically present the relative magnitude of, e.g., certain

types of support or rates assigned to branches (see Figure
2 and 3 for examples).
Different view modes

way to zoom in and out, fitting the zoom to the window

size, and a miniature overview (Figure 2) for navigating
large trees.
When applicable (i.e., given that branch length information is provided), trees can be displayed as phylogram or
chronogram (Figure 3), with multiple options for adjusting a scale bar (to indicate e.g. time spans in chronograms,
rates in ratograms, or branch lengths in phylograms).
Exporting to graphic formats and printing
TreeGraph 2 outputs various vector and (anti-aliased)
pixel graphic formats. Among these are SVG, PDF, or
PNG, supporting transparent background where this
applies. Using the graphic export function of TreeGraph 2,
the most adequate graphic formats, resolutions, and
image sizes for manuscripts, presentation slides, or web
pages, respectively, can be specified.
Help
An extensive, continuously updated online help system is
available under http://treegraph.bioinfweb.info/Help and
can also be accessed (in a context-dependent manner)
from within the program. Additionally, several video tutorials are offered there to get started with TreeGraph 2 (see
http://treegraph.bioinfweb.info/Help/wiki/Tuto
rial:Main_page).
Comparison to previous software
To date, a variety of tree visualization tools have been
released, among which ATV [17], Dendroscope [18],
FigTree (the tree editor accompanying BEAST), the MEGA
tree explorer [19], Mesquite [20], PhyloWidget [21],
TreeDyn [22] and TreeView [23] may be the most widely
distributed. In spite of their great usefulness for the purposes they have been developed for, none of these software packages allows simultaneously visualizing, freely
editing, properly formatting and exporting or printing
trees with heavily annotated nodes (see Figure 4).
Although TreeDyn is able to display multiple annotations
on one node it is not able to automatically position them
in a ready-to-publish way or to combine them from different analyses. FigTree is able to read the special Newick
annotations generated by BEAST and therefore can also
store several sets of annotations but only offers a limited
number of ways to display them (like branch lengths or
one textual annotation per branch). In contrast TreeGraph
2 (which is also able to read BEAST annotations) can
show a nearly unlimited number of textual annotations at
a time as well as display data in form of branch widths,
line colors or many other formats.

Besides importing additional annotations from tables
(which TreeDyn also offers), TreeGraph 2 is the only editor which can combine annotations (e.g. statistical support from different analysis methods) from different trees

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/7

(with the same set of terminals). The information gained
this way has a topological component and can therefore
not simply be obtained from data in a table.
A feature closely related to the ones mentioned above is
the ability to calculate numeric or textual annotations by
mathematical expressions which can reference other
annotations (see above). To date, a similar functionality is
not offered by any other tree editor.
TreeGraph 2 features a multitude of format options which
can be combined to every tree element (e.g. branches,
nodes or labels) independently. As Figure 4 shows, no
other tree editor currently provides functionalities like element-specific formats for all types of tree elements in
combination with advanced selection options or collision
free positioning of the whole tree. Moreover, none of the
editors that offer at least some of TreeGraph 2's formatting
options allow the user to precisely determine the print layout. In contrast to most other editors, our program offers
context help buttons (which link to the online help system) everywhere in the program, making it very easy for
new users to get started.
It should be noted, however, that TreeGraph 2 has been
optimized as a tree editor for producing high quality tree
figures and not as a viewer for trees with many thousands
of taxa which could never be depicted completely in a
publication or presentation. The latter is a specialty of
software specifically designed for this purpose such as,
e.g., Dendroscope [14] (Figure 4).
Since TreeGraph 2 is written in Java and is able to read and
write all its supported formats directly from and to
streams in would be possible to use it in a web application
either on the server (e.g. with Apache Tomcat) or the client site (e.g. as an Java applet or a Java webstart application) to display and manipulate trees. As yet, our
application would have to be integrated into such a web
application by its programmer manually and we do not
yet offer a ready-to-use plug-in solution for this. We do,
however, offer a full documentation of our source code
(including its interfaces) to facilitate such a web integration.

Conclusions
With its easy-to-use graphical user interface and a number
of semi-automatic editing and formatting options, TreeGraph 2 is a graphical editor useful in the context of any
phylogenetic study. It is particularly useful where multiple, potentially conflicting trees are being produced,
because its automatic combination of information from
different analyses helps to identify and graphically present
such incongruences. The way in which data can be
imported and then assigned to nodes, manipulated or
