Abstract
Background: Biological invasions provide a window on the process of community assembly. In particular, tracking
natural enemy recruitment to invading hosts can reveal the relative roles of co-evolution (including local
adaptation) and ecological sorting. We use molecular data to examine colonisation of northern Europe by the
parasitoid Megastigmus stigmatizans following invasions of its herbivorous oak gallwasp hosts from the Balkans.
Local host adaptation predicts that invading gallwasp populations will have been tracked primarily by sympatric
Balkan populations of M. stigmatizans (Host Pursuit Hypothesis). Alternatively, ecological sorting allows parasitoid
recruitment from geographically distinct populations with no recent experience of the invading hosts (Host Shift
Hypothesis). Finally, we test for long-term persistence of parasitoids introduced via human trade of their hosts’ galls
(Introduction Hypothesis).
Results: Polymorphism diagnostic of different southern refugial regions was present in both mitochondrial and
nuclear microsatellite markers, allowing us to identify the origins of northern European invaded range M.
stigmatizans populations. As with their hosts, some invaded range populations showed genetic variation diagnostic
of Balkan sources, supporting the Host Pursuit Hypothesis. In contrast, other invading populations had an Iberian
origin, unlike their hosts in northern Europe, supporting the Host Shift Hypothesis. Finally, both British and Italian
M. stigmatizans populations show signatures compatible with the Introduction Hypothesis from eastern
Mediterranean sources.
Conclusions: These data reveal the continental scale of multi-trophic impacts of anthropogenic disturbance and
highlight the fact that herbivores and their natural enemies may face very different constraints on range expansion.
The ability of natural enemies to exploit ecologically-similar hosts with which they have had no historical
association supports a major role for ecological sorting processes in the recent assembly of these communities.
The multitude of origins of invading natural enemy populations in this study emphasises the diversity of
mechanisms requiring consideration when predicting consequences of other biological invasions or biological
control introductions.

Background
Growing numbers of natural communities are being disrupted by biological invasions resulting from human
activity. The ecological impacts of these invasions depend
in part on whether they facilitate knock-on invasions by
other taxa, such as natural enemies, and the prevalence

of interactions between these secondary invaders and
native taxa. The scale and speed of natural enemy range
expansion and the likelihood of shifts to non-target hosts
are particularly crucial when predicting community
impacts of intentionally released biological control agents
[1]. Given the complexity of most ecological systems [2],
predicting such impacts is extremely challenging. More
generally, monitoring how communities develop around
invading species can allow testing of alternative models
of community assembly and evolution [3]. Here we use

Minor. This introduction has triggered multiple invasions by a suite of host-alternating gallwasps, reaching
northwards to Scotland and westwards to the northern
slopes of the Pyrenees [8,9,11]. Genetic data show that
all invading gallwasp populations have originated from
within the native Balkan range of Q. cerris, with no
range expansion by Iberian peninsula populations
[9,10,12]. In Iberia, cork oak (Q. suber) replaces Q. cerris, and Iberian gallwasp populations have proven unable
to make the host switch from Q. suber to Q. cerris that
is necessary for northwards range expansion.
This study concerns the response of the third trophic
level to gallwasp range expansion. Oak gallwasps support rich communities of parasitoid natural enemies
[8,13], and gallwasp range expansions triggered by planting of Q. cerris represent continental-scale experiments
in the assembly of such communities. Parasitoids have
recruited onto range-expanding gallwasps in invaded
regions [11,13,14], but their origins remain unclear.
However, determining where these parasitoids come
from can reveal underlying mechanisms in gallwasp
community assembly. If shared spatial histories and coevolution (including local adaptation) underpin species
interactions [5,15], we expect invading gallwasps to be

human-facilitated range expansion affecting three trophic
levels in a plant-herbivore-natural enemy system to
assess the relative importance of long-term historical
associations versus ecological sorting [4-6].
Our tri-trophic study system comprises gall-inducing
herbivorous wasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae), whose
distributions within the Western Palaearctic are tightly
coupled to those of their host oak trees, genus Quercus
[7], and parasitoid natural enemies [8]. Species in one
major clade of Andricus gallwasps have lifecycles involving host alternation between two oak lineages - the
black oaks of Quercus section Cerris (e.g. Q. cerris and
Q. suber) and the white oaks of Quercus section Quercus (e.g. Q. robur and Q. petraea). In the Western
Palaearctic natural co-existence of these two oak sections (and hence host-alternating gallwasps) is restricted
to southern Europe, Asia Minor and the Middle East;
only section Quercus oaks are native to Europe north of
the Pyrenees, Alps and Carpathians [9,10]. However,
over the last 400 years the region in which both oak
sections grow together has been dramatically expanded
by widespread human planting in northern and western
Europe of Turkey oak Q. cerris (Figure 1), a section Cerris species native to central and eastern Europe and Asia

pursued by enemies from the same Balkan origin (the
Host Pursuit Hypothesis); this hypothesis predicts no
parasitoid recruitment from alternative populations (for
example in Iberia) that have had no shared spatial or
co-refugial history with the invading hosts. An alternative model emphasises community assembly by ecological sorting, with a reduced impact of co-evolution or
local adaptation [4,6]. This model allows exploitation of
invading hosts by parasitoid populations that have no
recent history of exposure to invaders but that attack
ecologically similar hosts (the Host Shift Hypothesis).
More specifically, whilst this hypothesis does not preclude some degree of host pursuit from the Balkans, it
additionally predicts that expanding parasitoid populations could escape from Iberia even though their gallwasp hosts have not.
A third scenario potentially applies to this gallwasp system, involving co-introduction of both gallwasps and
their parasitoid enemies (the Introduction Hypothesis).
Accidental co-introduction is a feature of community
development around invading hosts [16] and is possible
because galls (and unintentionally their occupants) have
long been traded as a source of tannins for the manufacture of inks and dyes [[9] and references therein]. The
source for such galls was the eastern Mediterranean (particularly Lebanon and south-eastern Turkey), with
Roman Italy as the major historical destination. More
recently, vast numbers of galls of the host-alternator
Andricus kollari were imported into south-western
Britain from the eastern Mediterranean during the 1840s
[9]. Andricus kollari rapidly colonised Britain, and genetic
data show these introduced populations were derived
from at least two eastern Mediterranean sources [9]. It is
likely that parasitoids also escaped from these imported
galls, but it remains unknown whether any populations
successfully established. However, if they did establish we
would expect British and Italian populations (but not
other European populations) to exhibit genetic variation
diagnostic of the eastern Mediterranean.
These three hypotheses can be discriminated using
population genetic data for parasitoids specialising on
host-alternating gallwasps, whose populations in northern
Europe therefore must also be invading or introduced.
Our approach is to use a combination of mitochondrial
sequence and nuclear microsatellite data to identify
genetic variation diagnostic of southern and eastern
regions relevant to our hypotheses. Screening of invaded
range populations then allows assessment of the support
for the Host Pursuit, Host Shift and Introduction Hypotheses (genetic variation shared with the Balkans, Iberia or
eastern Mediterranean, respectively). The use of multiple
nuclear markers plus the independently evolving mitochondrial genome also allows further examination of the
histories of range expanding populations, such as the

extent to which invading populations from different origins maintain their genetic distinctiveness, or the role of
sex-biased dispersal [17,18].
Here we apply this approach to the parasitoid Megastigmus stigmatizans (Chalcidoidea, Torymidae). This
species is native to southern Europe (including Iberia),
Asia Minor and the Middle East where it attacks predominantly both widespread and refuge-specific hostalternating gallwasp species, and also now attacks
invading gallwasp populations throughout northern
Europe (see Table 1) [14,19]. Additionally, we target this
species as information from it is relevant to ongoing
work on a related Asian torymid parasitoid, Torymus
sinensis, recently released in Italy in an attempt to control an introduced and invading gallwasp pest of chestnuts [20,21]. Native oak gall parasitoids have been
reared from this invading gallwasp, indicating that oak
and chestnut gallwasp communities are trophically
linked [20]. We know of no study to date of the potential impacts of this release on native Western Palaearctic
gallwasp communities, so patterns shown by M. stigmatizans may reveal possible outcomes.

Methods
Sample collection

We reared 247 M. stigmatizans specimens from host galls
collected throughout the Western Palaearctic and stored
emerged adults at -20°C in 100% ethanol. At least 20 individuals were sampled from a range of hosts in each of
10 major regions relevant to our three hypotheses: Iran,
Lebanon, Turkey, the northern Balkans (Hungary and
eastern Austria), Italy, Germany/central France, western
France, Spain/Portugal, Morocco, and Britain (Figure 1,
Additional file 1). Smaller numbers were obtained from
the southern Balkans (Greece and Bulgaria). Our analysis
incorporated 29 previously sampled individuals from
Iberia and western France [19] and 17 additional samples
from this region. Only one M. stigmatizans individual was
sampled from each gall to minimise any impact of sampling siblings on population genetic analyses.
Molecular methods

Sequencing procedures followed Nicholls et al.[22]. A
590 base pair fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome
b gene (cyt b) was amplified for all samples using the
primers CP1 and CP2 [23]. This fragment gave a total
of 55 haplotypes, with 47 variable positions (22 parsimony informative). To increase signal from the mitochondrial genome, one individual from all but four of
the cyt b haplotypes was also sequenced for the Folmer
barcode region of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I
gene (COI; 652 base pairs) using the primers LCO and
HCO [24]. This added a further 23 variable characters,
14 of which were informative. One individual of the

All galls attacked are induced on Quercus section Quercus oaks by asexual generations. Host codes are used for hosts in Additional file 1.

congeneric oak gall parasitoids M. dorsalis and M. synophri was sequenced for both genes for use as outgroups
in the combined gene analysis. Sequences are available
from GenBank, accession numbers FJ026622-FJ026729.
To increase resolution of genetic structure and to corroborate the independent evolutionary status of mitochondrial lineages [25], we genotyped 227 of the 247
individuals for 13 nuclear microsatellite loci (Mst2, Mst3,
Mst4, Mst6, Mst9, Mst11, Mst12, Mst13, Mst14, Mdo1A,
Mdo6, Mdo7 and Mdo11) following protocols in Garnier
et al.[26]. PCR fragments were sized on an ABI 3730
capillary machine and scored using ABI’s custom software GeneMapper v4.0.

sampled every 1000 generations, with the final 500,000
generations used for assessing tree topology and node
support. Convergence of parameters between runs was
assessed using Tracer v1.4 [29].
For the combined cyt b and COI data, partitioning by
both gene and codon position produced similar parameter estimates for corresponding codon positions and
the same tree topology as partitioning by codon position
only, so final analyses used this simpler three partition
model. Application of the procedure described above for
cyt b resulted in adoption of HKY+I as the model for
each codon position, with a constant clock-like mutation
rate.

Phylogenetic inference from mitochondrial DNA

Analyses of microsatellite data

Basecalling of sequences was confirmed using Sequence
Navigator[27]. Sequences were checked for an open reading frame and aligned using DNAstar (DNAstar Inc.,
Madison WI, USA). Phylogenetic relationships among
unique M. stigmatizans cyt b haplotypes were reconstructed using MrBayes v3.1.2 [28]. The data were partitioned by codon position, with substitution rates allowed
to vary among partitions. Since some categories of transversions were not present within each partition the data
were initially modelled using a HKY+I+G model for each
codon position. This model was then simplified following
the procedure in Nicholls et al.[22], resulting in HKY+I
+G, HKY and HKY+I for first, second and third positions
respectively. MrBayes analyses incorporated two independent runs of 6,000,000 generations, each with 4 chains
and a temperature of 0.15. Parameters and trees were

Individuals were screened for 13 loci (see Additional file
1) with 3 to 32 (mean = 13.9) alleles per locus. As
wasps are haplodiploid, with haploid males and diploid
females, only diploid (i.e. female) genotypes were initially used to assess concordance with the assumptions of
further population genetic analyses. We tested for
departures from Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium using Arlequin v2.001 [30] within each of the
sampling regions specified above. Significance levels
were adjusted for multiple tests using a sequential
Bonferroni correction and a table-wide alpha of 0.05.
Significant departures were obtained for 23 of 113 tests
of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and 16 of 6259 tests of
linkage equilibrium; however, these departures showed
no consistency across loci or populations so all data
were included in subsequent analyses.

Phylogeographic structure in the complete microsatellite data was assessed using Structure[31] to identify the
number (K) of discrete population clusters in the data,
and then mapping the geographic extent of these clusters. In these analyses, the second (non-existent) allele
in males was coded as missing to allow inclusion of
both male haplotypes and female genotypes in one analysis; separate analyses using only the male or female
datasets gave almost identical results (data not shown).
Analyses incorporating K values of 1-16 were run for
1,000,000 generations with a burn-in of 100,000 generations, with convergence in estimated parameter values
checked over 10 independent runs for each K. An
admixture model was used, allowing individuals to have
ancestry from multiple populations, with population
allele frequencies assumed to be independent.
Relationships among the clusters found by Structure
were assessed using only those individuals with limited
evidence of admixture (a minimum of 80% of their
genotype assigned to a single population). Nei’s genetic
distance [32] was calculated between all pairwise combinations of clusters and then used to construct a
neighbour-joining tree in PHYLIP[33]. Node support
was assessed from 1000 bootstrap replicates based on
resampled data matrices of loci across clusters. A second metric based on pairwise FST between clusters was
also calculated, and gave almost identical results (data
not shown).

Results
Regionally diagnostic genetic structure in M. stigmatizans’
native range

Genetic variation in both mitochondrial and microsatellite datasets was diagnostic of major regions across the
native range of M. stigmatizans, with strong concordance between an individual’s mtDNA lineage and the
cluster to which the majority of its microsatellite genotype was assigned (c2 = 449.8, d.f. = 21, P ≈ 0). Three
well-supported regional clades were resolved in the cyt
b (Figure 2; named the European, Iberian and Lebanese
lineages) and combined mitochondrial (Figure 3) datasets, with multiple Turkish and Iranian haplotypes distinct from the major lineages. The microsatellite data
provided greater resolution, with strongest support for
eight population clusters (posterior probability of ~1 for
K = 8) showing similar geographic structuring to the
mitochondrial data (Figure 4). Few individuals showed
significant evidence of admixture (microsatellite alleles
originating from different clusters; see Additional file 2),
suggesting limited migration between these spatially
separated populations. Balkan populations were characterised by cyt b haplotypes in the European lineage and
microsatellite genotypes in cluster 3. Iberian populations
were characterised by cyt b haplotypes in the Iberian

lineage and microsatellite genotypes in clusters 1 or 2.
Eastern populations were the most genetically diverse
for both marker types, and were characterised by cyt b
haplotypes either in the Lebanese lineage (Lebanon,
Iran) or in a distinct central polytomy (Turkey, Iran),
with microsatellite genotypes in clusters 4-8. This
regionally-diagnostic variation allowed unequivocal
inference of the origin of invading M. stigmatizans
populations across their non-native range.
Origins of non-native M. stigmatizans in northern Europe

The molecular data show that all three hypothesised
mechanisms have contributed to range expansion in
M. stigmatizans. The Host Pursuit Hypothesis is supported by assignment of cyt b sequences from Britain,
France and Germany to the European lineage (Figure 2),
and the observation that European microsatellite genotypes dominate populations in Germany and southeastern Britain (cluster 3 in Figure 4). While Italy could
potentially have been the source of these European genotypes, none of the other microsatellite clusters that are
present at high frequency in Italy (clusters 4, 5 and 8)
occurred further north in continental Europe, indicating
that these northern M. stigmatizans populations are
derived from the remainder of the refugial distribution
of cluster 3 in the Balkans, as is the case with their
hosts. Notably, European lineage mitochondrial haplotypes were more widespread than microsatellite genotypes from the same origin, occurring through all but
southern-most France and throughout southern Britain.
Genetic diversity within the European mitochondrial
lineage declined with distance from the Balkan origin
(only five European lineage cyt b haplotypes were
observed in northern Europe compared to 10 in the
Balkan peninsula), and haplotype 6 was particularly
widespread and abundant (found in 54% of European
lineage individuals and occurring throughout the
lineage’s geographic range).
The Host Shift Hypothesis was supported by the presence of Iberian lineage cyt b haplotypes in central and
northern France (Figure 2), and widespread occurrence
of cluster 2 microsatellite genotypes across France into
south-eastern Britain (site 70; Figure 4). As with the
European mitochondrial lineage, northern populations
showed reduced diversity with haplotype 38 dominant;
however, some individuals sampled from central France,
northern France and Britain that were assigned to the
Iberian microsatellite cluster 2 had European lineage
mitochondrial haplotypes (see Additional file 2).
The Introduction Hypothesis was supported for both
Britain and Italy by inclusion of cyt b haplotypes from
these regions in the Lebanese lineage (Figure 2). Cluster
8 in the microsatellite data also showed the same disjunct
distribution, at high frequency in Britain and some Italian

populations, and low but significant frequency in some
Middle Eastern populations (Figure 4; Additional file 2).
Neither the mitochondrial Lebanese clade nor the microsatellite cluster 8 occurred in geographically intervening
regions, thus excluding the possibility that any natural
range expansion event could have given rise to this pattern. The dominance of microsatellite cluster 8 in southwestern Britain is striking, with all but one microsatellite
genotype from sites 67-69 allocated to this cluster; the
final genotype showed admixture with another eastern
population, the Iranian cluster 7. Equally striking is the
lack of nuclear admixture between south-western British
populations and the microsatellite genotypes found in
south-eastern Britain and neighbouring continental
Europe; however, European lineage mitochondrial haplotypes were sampled from south-western individuals (see
Additional file 2). These patterns strongly support the
Introduction Hypothesis for British M. stigmatizans, with
no subsequent cross-Channel genetic exchange with
mainland Europe other than in the south-east.
The Introduction Hypothesis also explained microsatellite genotype patterns seen in Italy. These populations

are genetically diverse, with contributions from central
Europe (cluster 3) and multiple eastern populations
(clusters 4, 5, 7 and 8). However, in contrast to British
populations, more than a third of Italian individuals
showed a strong signature of genetic admixture between
these sources (see Additional file 2). The distribution of
alleles shared by Britain or Italy and other populations
underlines support for the Introduction Hypothesis.
Nineteen alleles were shared only by Britain or Italy and
either Lebanon or Turkey (Figure 5). Other than five
alleles shared between Italy and central Europe (a pattern expected given the evidence grouping these populations) no other region shared alleles exclusively with
Britain or Italy, supporting a process of introduction
from these eastern source populations.

Discussion
The complex invasion history of M. stigmatizans

Our results reveal a complex invasion history for
M. stigmatizans in northern Europe, with strong support for all three invasion hypotheses. Some individuals
are clearly derived from the Balkan native range of

both their gallwasp hosts and Q. cerris, the oak upon
which the entire trophic cascade depends [9,10,34],
supporting the Host Pursuit Hypothesis. Unlike some
invading host gallwasps [10,34] but in common with
the gallwasp A. kollari [9], Balkan parasitoid populations have colonised only as far as south-eastern
Britain. In contrast to Iberian host-alternating

gallwasps, Iberian M. stigmatizans have expanded their
distribution northwards, dominating invading populations throughout France and supporting the Host
Shift Hypothesis. Our data confirm preliminary haplotype-based observation of this pattern [19] and extend
the limits of range expansion by Iberian populations to
south-eastern Britain (microsatellite cluster 2).

are presented as the proportion of the sample at each site that was assigned to each cluster; size of circles corresponds to the number of
individuals at that site (n = 1-23). The insert shows the relationships among clusters with bootstrap support, determined by neighbour-joining
analysis of Nei’s genetic distance.

Figure 5 Number of private alleles in per geographic region
for 13 Megastigmus stigmatizans microsatellite loci. Grey bars
indicate alleles private to a single region, alleles shared only with
Italy are in black, alleles shared with both Italy and Britain are in
white, and alleles shared only with Britain are indicated by diagonal
lines.

Finally, most British populations and some Italian
individuals show evidence of eastern ancestry consistent
with the Introduction Hypothesis. This is consistent
with the known import of host galls to Britain during
the 1840s [9,35]. Eastern genotypes in Italy probably
derive from much earlier trade, perhaps dating back to
Roman times [9]. Genetic data for British A. kollari suggested introduction from two distinct sources, neither of
which matched sampled populations [9]. A similar pattern applies to M. stigmatizans; although some British
and Lebanese cyt b sequences indicate a close relationship, none of the sampled eastern populations share the
dominance of microsatellite cluster 8 characteristic of
south-western Britain, and clear structure in the microsatellite data argue against the cluster 8 source population being in southern (cluster 5) or northern (cluster 6)
Lebanon. One possibility is that the dominance of cluster 8 in Britain results from a genetic bottleneck in the
introduced population [10]. However, the existence of a
parallel pattern with no obvious loss of genetic variation

Nicholls et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:322
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/322

in introduced A. kollari suggests the presence, at least in
the 1840s, of a genetically discrete oak gall community
in an eastern Mediterranean region that we have yet to
sample. Neighbour-joining analysis grouped cluster 8
with the Turkish cluster 4, so this unknown source
population may have been north of Lebanon, perhaps in
Syria or south-eastern Turkey as was also suggested for
A. kollari and consistent with Aleppo, in Syria, being a
probable centre of the oak gall trade [9]. Although this
putative origin could potentially be located by more
sampling, extensive deforestation in this region since the
mid-nineteenth century [36] may mean that the introduced eastern genotypes of both host and parasitoid
that dominate British populations no longer exist at
their geographic source.
Modes of range expansion in M. stigmatizans

Our data show that persistent patterns have established in
the nuclear genetic structure of non-native M. stigmatizans populations. In southwestern Britain, eastern genotypes have persisted for 170 years with no evidence of
significant cross-Channel gene flow from western France.
On mainland Europe, both Balkan and Iberian populations
have spread without known human assistance over at least
1000 km of previously unoccupied habitat over at most
400 years, with little evidence of mixing except where both
contribute genetic diversity to the extreme southeast of
Britain. The persistent integrity of eastern genotypes in
Britain and evidence of limited cross-channel gene flow
parallels exactly the pattern seen in A. kollari [9]. Other
gallwasp invasions indicate that these insects can cross the
Channel without significant loss of genetic diversity [10],
so lack of dispersal is unlikely to explain the observed pattern. Instead, the first arrivals may have established a
genetic dominance in populations that was resistant to
rare arrivals from genetically divergent populations, as predicted by leptokurtic dispersal models [37,38]. Such
genetic dominance can establish very quickly [10], so rapid
establishment of host-shifting colonists from Iberia could
also explain why central European genetic diversity in
M. stigmatizans is conspicuously absent from France. This
contrasts with extensive genetic admixture between multiple eastern and European populations in Italy which is
consistent with co-existence over much longer timescales,
a pattern mirrored in refugial Spain and Lebanon where
multiple microsatellite clusters have a long history of
co-existence.
However, patterns in the mitochondrial genome differ
subtly from those described above for the nuclear genome. Introgression of central European haplotypes into
both Iberian and eastern nuclear backgrounds was seen
in France and Britain, respectively. This perhaps indicates a degree of uni-directional female-biased dispersal
followed by backcrossing with local populations, or

Page 9 of 12

alternatively introgression of selectively advantageous
Balkan mitochondria. Either way, it highlights the inability of populations invading from multiple sources to
maintain complete genetic distinctiveness. So although
genetic diversity within specific source lineages
decreased as populations expanded northwards [see also
[10]], total genetic diversity at the limits of the nonnative range remained high due to contributions from
multiple source lineages. This parallels patterns seen in
other taxa expanding their distributions, either naturally
or with human assistance, across Europe from multiple
sources [9,39].
Host shifts and the evolution of oak gall communities

The ability of Iberian M. stigmatizans to colonise France
highlights the fact that herbivores and their natural enemies may face very different constraints on range expansion. While Iberian gallwasps have failed to shift from
Q. suber in Iberia to Q. cerris north of the Pyrenees,
M. stigmatizans was able to shift from Iberian hosts to
invading hosts once these came within reach. Unlike
other species [40], no discernable population bottleneck
accompanied this shift, suggesting the invaders were easy
to exploit as hosts. Ability to exploit unfamiliar hosts is
also supported by the genetic data in Britain. Eastern
M. stigmatizans genotypes must originally have been
associated only with co-introduced eastern A. kollari.
However, our sampling revealed eastern M. stigmatizans
genotypes in individuals attacking another gallwasp host,
A. quercuscalicis. This gallwasp invaded Britain from the
Balkans in the late 1950s [10] and is absent from the eastern Mediterranean (Table 1). Eastern origin M. stigmatizans must thus have shifted host from A. kollari to
A. quercuscalicis in the last 50 years, equating to a maximum of only 50 generations as M. stigmatizans is univoltine. Recent additional British sampling has also revealed
M. stigmatizans attacking a novel native gallwasp host,
Biorhiza pallida (K. Schönrogge & J.A. Nicholls unpubl.
data). These host shifts in France and Britain suggest
that oak or gall traits required for host recognition by
M. stigmatizans are broad enough to accommodate any
divergence among host populations in different regions
of the Western Palaearctic that have been separated for
multiple glacial cycles [19,41,42], implying co-evolutionary interactions such as local adaptation between refugial
populations of M. stigmatizans and its gallwasp hosts are
weak or non-existent. Although the timescale of such
divergence is difficult to estimate, the most recent interglacial allowing possible mixing of oak communities
between Iberia and central Europe was around 130,000
years ago [43]. However, both the mitochondrial tree
(Figure 3) and the microsatellite data (insert in Figure 4)
indicate that Iberian and central European populations
have a non-sister relationship, suggesting that these

Nicholls et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:322
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/322

populations have had independent evolutionary histories
for a much longer period on the same timescale (or
longer than) the divergence between European and Middle Eastern populations. It has been argued that the massive range shifts caused by Pleistocene glaciations [44,45]
may have selected against highly co-evolved species associations in favour of a degree of generalist opportunism
[46]. This may explain why most oak gall parasitoids
exploit suites of hosts sharing similar gall phenotypes
[47]. Thus patterns in M. stigmatizans, and in oak galls
more generally, support a major and continuing role for
ecological sorting in the recent assembly of these
communities.
While M. stigmatizans and its gallwasp hosts have differing invasion histories in northern Europe, they share
similar patterns of genetic diversification across their
native ranges. The major divisions between M. stigmatizans lineages in Iberia, central Europe and the Middle
East correspond to major Pleistocene refugia for many
Western Palaearctic taxa [44,45]. The placement of Iranian and Turkish sequences in a central unresolved
polytomy in the cyt b tree (Figure 2) and the basal placement of the Lebanese lineage in the combined mitochondrial analysis (Figure 3) also support an overall
eastern origin for M. stigmatizans. These patterns are
shared with other oak gallwasp and parasitoid species
examined to date [9,12,22,41,48,49] supporting hypotheses of an eastern origin for Western Palaearctic oak
gallwasp communities as a whole [7].
Implications for the release of biocontrol agents

Oak gallwasp communities illustrate several major issues
associated with impacts of introduced species on native
communities. Substantial changes in community structure can develop rapidly [11,13,14,20], and parasitoids
associated with invading hosts can reach very high
population densities, with potential impacts on native
hosts through apparent competition [11,13,50]. In addition, limitations to range expansion experienced by their
hosts are irrelevant to parasitoids as long as suitable
alternative hosts exist. This significance of biotic interactions on species distributions has been described in
other systems, and underlines the risk of applying climate-envelope approaches to modelling community
level responses to perturbation [3,51,52]. Megastigmus
stigmatizans shows that understanding range expansion
in parasitoids, and predicting impacts in associated communities, requires identification of the factors defining
their host choice, and hence of the potential for range
expansion via host shifts. This issue is of immediate
relevance in Europe, where the biocontrol agent Torymus sinensis has been released to control the invading
chestnut gallwasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus. Although
T. sinensis is an effective biocontrol agent previously

Page 10 of 12

deployed in Asia and America [20,21], its ability to
attack non-target hosts remains largely untested. Chestnut gallwasps are recognised as hosts by native oak gall
parasitoids [20], so T. sinensis may likewise attack native
oak gallwasps. If so, the potential exists for it not only
to pursue its invading pest host, but also (as M. stigmatizans has done) to shift to non-target hosts and disperse much more widely in the Western Palaearctic.
Until this parasitoid’s ability to exploit non-target hosts
is understood, the wider impacts of its ongoing release
remain impossible to predict.

Conclusions
In conclusion, this study highlights the major role for
ecological sorting processes in the recent assembly of
complex communities in response to anthropogenic disturbance. Different trophic levels may face very different
ecological constraints on range expansion, resulting in
varying phylogeographic histories of species interacting
within the same community. The multitude of origins of
invading natural enemy populations in this study
emphasises the diversity of mechanisms requiring consideration when trying to predict the consequences of
human-mediated ecological perturbations such as biological invasions or the intentional release of biological
control agents.
