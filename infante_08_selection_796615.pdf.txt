Abstract
Background: Flatfish metamorphosis involves major physiological and morphological changes.
Due to its importance in aquaculture and as a model for developmental studies, some gene
expression studies have focused on the understanding of this process using quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR) technique. Therefore, adequate reference genes for accurate normalization are
required.
Results: The stability of 12 potential reference genes was examined during larval development in
Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) and Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) to determine the
most suitable genes for qRT-PCR analysis. Transcription levels of genes encoding β-Actin (ACTB),
glyceraldehyde-3P-dehydrogenase (GAPDH), annexin A2 (ANXA2), glutathione S-transferase
(GST), ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT1),
ubiquitin (UBQ), elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A1), 18S ribosomal RNA, and the ribosomal
proteins S4 (RPS4) and L13a (RPL13a) were quantitated. Two paralogous genes for ACTB were
analyzed in each of both flatfish species. In addition, two paralogous genes for GAPDH were studied
in Senegalese sole. RPL13a represented non-orthologous genes between both flatfish species.
GeNorm and NormFinder analyses for expression stability revealed RPS4, UBQ and eEF1A1 as the
most stable genes in Senegalese sole, Atlantic halibut and in a combined analysis. In all cases,
paralogous genes exhibited differences in expression stability.
Conclusion: This work suggests RPS4, UBQ, and eEF1A1 genes as useful reference genes for
accurate normalization in qRT-PCR studies in Senegalese sole and Atlantic halibut larvae. The
congruent results between both species in spite of the drastic differences in larval development
suggest that selected housekeeping genes (HKGs) could be useful in other flatfish species.
However, the finding of paralogous gene copies differentially expressed during development in
some HKGs underscores the necessity to identify orthologous genes.

Background
Pleuronectiformes (flatfish) are a broad taxonomic group
comprising 11 families and about 500 species worldwide,
and some of them are of high commercial interest both in
fisheries and aquaculture. Senegalese sole, Solea senegalensis, and Atlantic halibut, Hippoglossus hippoglossus, are two
representative species of Pleuronectidae and Soleidae
families, respectively. Pleuronectidae (right-eye flounders) and Soleidae (soles) families include 93 species in
39 genera and 89 species in 22 genera, respectively [1,2].
All these species share in common an asymmetrical body
development and a bottom-dwelling mode of life.
Although they possess bilateral body symmetry during the
larval stages, they undergo drastic morphological and
physiological changes in order to become an asymmetric
benthic juvenile. Senegalese sole and Atlantic halibut
show clear differences in the timing of larval development
and metamorphosis (Figure 1). In Atlantic halibut, hatching occurs approximately two weeks after fertilization. The
yolk-sack period extends to 46–50 days after hatching
(DAH) and the metamorphosis begins very late with the
migration of the left eye about 80 DAH, taking 2–3 weeks
[3]. In contrast, Senegalese sole hatches 3 days after fertilization and first feeding occurs at 3 DAH. Metamorphosis
takes only one week between 12 and 19 DAH [4]. In spite
of the differences in the timing of metamorphosis, this
process is mediated by thyroid hormones (THs) in both
species [5,6]. Because of the intrinsically interesting role

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/28

in development as well as the subsequent effects on characteristics such as growth, deformities or malpigmentations, which are important in aquaculture, flatfish
metamorphosis has been the subject of gene expression
studies using PCR-based methods [7-9]. However, adequate and reliable reference genes for accurate quantification remain to be validated.
Quantitative real-time PCR has become one of the most
widespread techniques for mRNA gene expression analysis due to its accuracy, broad dynamic range, sensitivity
and reproducibility [10-12]. Although absolute and relative quantitation approaches are possible, the latter is preferred due to the normalization of sample variations using
internal housekeeping genes (HKGs). These HKGs act as
endogenous controls that allow for the correction of
experimental variations caused by pipetting errors, inhibitory compounds, reverse transcription (RT) efficiency or
quality of starting material [11]. Traditionally, highly
expressed genes such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH), β-actin (ACTB) or 18S ribosomal RNA have been considered as putative HKGs. Due to
their key role in metabolism, cytoskeleton and ribosome
structure, respectively, it is generally assumed that they are
expressed at a constant level in different tissues, cells or
experimental treatments. However, there is increasing evidence that their expression can vary during development
or in response to external treatments [13-15]. In addition,

some of them (i.e. GAPDH and other glycolytic enzymes
as well as ribosomal proteins) possess functional paralogous genes that exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns
(muscle, liver and/or brain) [16-19]. As an alternative, the
use of multiple internal control genes have been proposed
[20]. Different algorithms have been developed to choose
the most appropriate HKG combination set [20-22].
However, candidate reference genes need to be validated
under the specific experimental conditions being evaluated.
The development of large-scale genomics of Senegalese
sole and Atlantic halibut (Pleurogene project; [23]) has
made possible the availability of a large number of EST
sequences. We have identified commonly used reference
genes in both species. Twelve candidate HKGs for gene
expression analysis during larval developmental in Senegalese sole and Atlantic halibut have been investigated.
The possible use of the selected HKGs for gene expression
studies in other flatfish species is discussed.

Results
mRNA transcription levels of potential HKGs during larval
development
A total of 12 genes were evaluated as potential HKGs in
Senegalese sole and Atlantic halibut. Owing to the widespread use of GAPDH and ACTB as reference genes, different paralogous genes identified in Senegalese sole and
Atlantic halibut were included in the analysis. Only
ACTB1 and GAPDH1 were considered orthologs in Senegalese sole and Atlantic halibut as determined by phylogenetic analysis and gene expression profile in tissues. In
addition, RPL13a genes were paralogous copies between
the two flatfish species. ODC could not be detected in
Senegalese sole EST libraries and thus it was only analyzed
in Atlantic halibut.

The Ct value indicates the fractional cycle at which the fluorescence intensity equals the threshold fluorescence. Ct
values are inversely related with the abundance of a specific transcript in the sample and they have to be converted to a linear form by using the amplification
efficiency to estimate gene expression changes. Ct values
of HKGs in Senegalese sole ranged between 11.05 (18S
rRNA) and 27.20 (RPL13a) (Figure 2). In Atlantic halibut,

Ct values varied between 7.35 (18S rRNA) and 30.16
(ANXA2). HPRT1, ANXA2 and GST were expressed at low
levels in both flatfish species (median Ct values above 20
cycles). The smallest Ct variation was exhibited by
GAPDH2 (1.25) and 18S rRNA (1.80) in the Senegalese
sole and by 18S rRNA (1.25), ACTB1 (2.45) and HPRT1
(2.61) in the halibut. On the contrary, RPL13a (4.40),
GAPDH1 (3.45) and ACTB1 (3.45) showed the most variable expression levels in the sole, whereas ANXA2 (7.34)
and GAPDH1 (5.99) were the most variable in the halibut.
The mRNA expression profiles for all HKGs studied in
Senegalese sole and Atlantic halibut during larval development are depicted in Figures 3 and 4. ANXA2 exhibited
the most pronounced variation in Atlantic halibut since
expression levels dropped 6.75 Cts from hatching to 57
DAH. In Senegalese sole, RPL13a showed the highest Ct
variation (3.95) between 3 and 13 DAH.
Gene expression stability analysis
Expression stability for each HKG during larval development in Senegalese sole and Atlantic halibut was analyzed
using the geNorm and NormFinder software. GeNorm (or
pairwise comparison approach) ranks HKGs according to
the similarity of the expression profiles across the sample
set. All investigated genes exhibited high average expression stability (M) values (lower than 1 in both species). In
the Senegalese sole, ACTB2, RPS4, GAPDH2, UBQ and
eEF1A1 were the most stable genes with M values lower
than 0.5. In Atlantic halibut, HPRT1, ACTB2, UBQ,
eEF1a1, RPS4 and RPL13a exhibited M values lower than
0.5 (Figure 5). Additionally, a combined analysis to determine the most stable genes in both flatfish was carried
out. In this analysis, only the putative orthologous genes
in both flatfish species were included. Although higher M
values were observed, ACTB1, RPS4, UBQ and eEF1A1
showed M values lower than 0.6.

To determine the minimum number of HKGs necessary
for an accurate normalization, a pairwise variation Vn/n+1
analysis was performed (Figure 6). If we take into account
the default cut-off value of 0.15 [24], geometric averaging
of 3 genes in Senegalese sole and 2 in Atlantic halibut
would be required for accurate normalization. Combined
analysis yielded a V2/3 value of 0.138 although the inclusion of a third reference gene reduced slightly the pairwise
variation (V3/4 = 0.132).
NormFinder (Model-based approach) ranks the best candidate HKGs according to their minimal combined interand intragroup expression variation [21]. Results of
NormFinder analysis for our data are shown in Table 1. In
Senegalese sole, GAPDH2, RPS4, ACTB2, eEF1A1 and
UBQ appeared as the most stable genes (stability between

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/28

0.219 and 0.289). In Atlantic halibut, RPS4, UBQ,
RPL13a, GST, HPRT1 and eEF1A1 showed the highest stability values (0.159–0.348). These HKG data sets agree
with those obtained using geNorm with slight differences
in the ranking order. Combined analysis showed RPS4,
UBQ and eEF1A1 as the most stable genes (0.278–0.413)

Discussion
Flatfish metamorphosis is characterized by drastic morphological and physiological changes that determine the
switch from a pelagic to a benthic lifestyle. During this
period, erythrocyte populations and myosin light chains
change to adult types [25,26], gastric glands differentiate
[27] and an asymmetrical pigmentation develops [8,28].
Owing to the interest of larval stages from flatfish in developmental studies and their impact on essential characteristics of interest in aquaculture (digestion, pigmentation,
growth, etc), some gene expression surveys have focused
on this developmental period. However, appropriate
HKGs that ensure reliable and accurate mRNA quantitation are required. To our knowledge, this is the first study
that evaluates the suitability of potential HKGs for gene
expression analysis in flatfish larvae. Twelve potential
HKGs in the pleuronectid Atlantic halibut and the soleid
Senegalese sole were investigated. The high similarity for
the most stable HKGs in spite of the differences in the timing of metamorphosis (12–19 DAH in Senegalese sole,
and 80–100 DAH in Atlantic halibut) and metamorphic
stages (S1–S4 in Senegalese sole [4], and stages 6–9 [29]
in Atlantic halibut), gives support and highlight the suitability for gene expression studies in other flatfish.
Two different analytical approaches were used to study
the most suitable HKGs during larval development. The
pairwise comparison approach (geNorm) selects the most
suitable HKGs on the basis of the variation of expression
ratios between HKGs expression across sample set. Genes
with the lowest M (internal control gene-stability measure) values have the most stable expression [20]. However, the geNorm algorithm is highly dependent on the
assumption that none of the genes being analyzed are coregulated. Although most HKGs analyzed in this study are
involved in different cellular functions, such co-regulation
cannot be ruled out since some genes of the translational
apparatus have been analyzed and the broad effect of THs
on metabolism and flatfish metamorphosis [5,30,31].
Hence, HKG expression data were also analyzed using a
model-based approach (NormFinder). This methodology
ranks candidate genes on the basis of the minimal interand intragroup variation [21]. Both experimental
approaches identified a similar HKG subset as the most
stable. Although only two and three genes were necessary
for accurate normalization in Senegalese sole and Atlantic
halibut, respectively, and only two in the combined analysis as determined by GeNorm, the inclusion of one addi-

tional gene clearly improved the pairwise variation in all
cases. Hence, RPS4, UBQ and eEF1A1, involved in protein
biosynthesis and degradation, appeared as the most suitable HKG set for accurate normalization in gene expression studies during larval development in flatfish.
Three rounds of large-scale gene duplications have been
identified in fish [19,32]. These duplications are responsible, at least in part, for the speciation, the adaptive radiations and the high morphological complexity of fish [33].
The majority of these gene duplicates are lost or silenced
during evolution, and only in some instances they can
either acquire new functions or divide the ancestral original functions [19,34]. Several paralogous genes including

pseudogenes have been described for glycolytic enzymes
[18,19], ribosomal proteins [16,35], or elongation factor
1 alpha [14], some of which are routinely considered as
potential HKGs. Our data demonstrate that expression
profiles and stability vary between paralogous gene copies. GAPDH2 exhibited higher gene stability than
GAPDH1 in Senegalese sole. Similarly, ACTB2 showed
higher stability than ACTB1 in both species as determined
both with geNorm and NormFinder approaches. If we
compare the ranking of the two species, the RPL13a paralogous genes were ranked differentially in the two species.
In contrast, ACTB1 and GAPDH1 orthologous genes were
ranked in a similar way. These data underscore the necessity for a phylogenetic analysis to demonstrate orthology

in order to select the appropriate HKG in other flatfish
and to make expression profiles comparable between species. In addition, the design of primers is a key point. Due
to the high similarity in the coding sequence between
some paralogous genes, it becomes necessary to confirm
that the paralog of interest is amplified by sequencing of
the PCR products or by designing the primers in divergent
regions of the UTRs. The simultaneously cross-amplification of different paralogous genes that are differentially
expressed would render a consensus expression profile

that would make the comparisons among species difficult.
GAPDH has been traditionally considered as a HKG due
to its key role in the glycolytic pathway. However, GAPDH
is associated with several functions during evolution such
as membrane fusion, microtubule bundling, phosphotransferase activity, nuclear RNA export, DNA replication
and repair, apoptosis, age-related neurodegenerative disease, prostate cancer and viral pathogenesis (reviewed in

[36]). There is increasing evidence that the expression of
this gene is modified during development, in tissues and
by physiological conditions [13-15]. Our expression data
ranked GAPDH1 (muscle-specific isoform) as an inadequate HKG in both Senegalese sole and Atlantic halibut.
These data agree with recent findings that have demonstrated a down-regulation of GAPDH1, contrary to
GAPDH2, by THs [18], a key regulator of metamorphosis
in the two species [5,6]. This differential regulation
between both GAPDH paralogous genes would explain
the higher expression stability of GAPDH2 (brain-specific
isoform), ranked as the best HKG by NormFinder, and the
inadequacy of GAPDH1 as HKG during larval development in the two flatfishes.

Conclusion
Our results indicate that RPS4, eEF1A1 and UBQ genes
may be good candidate reference genes for larval development studies in flatfish as selected by geNorm and
NormFinder. However, the application of these genes to
achieve an accurate normalization in gene expression
studies in other species requires the identification of putative orthologous genes.

Methods
Source of fish and experimental rearing conditions
All experimental Senegalese sole larvae were obtained
from fertilized eggs collected from breeding tanks where
breeders spawned naturally under ambient conditions.
Eggs were incubated at a density of 2000 eggs L-1 in 300 L
cylinder conical tanks with gentle aeration and one water
exchange every two hours. Temperature and salinity during all experiments were 20°C and 38 ppt, respectively.

Newly hatched larvae were transferred to a 400 L tank at
an initial density from 45 to 50 larvae L-1 with a 16L:8D
photoperiod and a light intensity of 600–800 lux. Larvae
were fed rotifers (Brachionus plicatilis) between 3 DAH and
9 DAH. From 7 DAH enriched brine shrimp (Artemia sp.)
metanauplii were fed until the end of the experiment.
Pools of larvae from 2 to 22 DAH (n = 3) were collected,
washed with DEPC water, frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at -80°C until analysis.
Atlantic halibut larval samples were obtained from Scotian Halibut Limited (Clark's Harbour, Nova Scotia, Canada). Fertilized eggs and hatched larvae were incubated at
6 – 7°C until 5 – 6 weeks of age after hatching. After this
stage, larvae were raised at 10.0 – 11.2°C. The samples
were taken at 1 DAH (hatching), 33, 48, 57, 68, 82, 92,
and 103. Sampled larvae were anaesthetized in overdosed
tricaine methane sulfonate (TMS, Syndel Laboratories,
Vancouver, BC, Canada), and then, transferred to
RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) and kept overnight
at 4°C. The samples were removed from RNAlater and
individually stored in a 1.6 ml microfuge tube at -80°C
until RNA was isolated. Ten, 5, and 2 individuals were
pooled to isolate total RNA from samples at 1, 33, and 48
DAH, respectively. One whole fish was used to obtain
total RNA at other stages. Three RNA samples were
obtained for each stage.

(RPL13a). Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) encoding HKGs
from Senegalese sole and Atlantic halibut were identified
after sequence analysis of normalized cDNA libraries constructed from different larval stages and adult tissues.
ODC was only identified in H. hippoglossus. Two different
genes encoding for GAPDH (referred to as GAPDH1 and
GAPDH2) [18] and for ACTB (referred to as ACTB1 and
ACTB2) were identified in both species. Similarly, two
RPL13a genes were identified in Senegalese sole. RPL13alike1 was orthologous of RPL13a gene in halibut. However, to compare gene expression stability between paralogs, the RPL13a-like2 (referred to as RPL13a in the text),
probably a pseudogene, was analyzed in this study.
Sequences for each HKG in both flatfish species were
aligned to assess orthology. GAPDH1 and ACTB1
sequences were orthologs in Senegalese sole and Atlantic
halibut. In contrast, ACTB2 and RPL13a were paralogs
between both flatfish species. GAPDH2 only was studied
in Senegalese sole. Accession numbers and main function
of each HKG evaluated are indicated in Table 2.

RNA isolation and gene expression analysis
Homogenization of Senegalese sole larvae was carried out
using Lysing Matrix D (Q-BioGene Inc., Carlsbad, CA,
USA) for 40 s at speed setting 6 in the Fastprep FG120
instrument (Bio101, Thermo Savant Instruments). Total
RNA was isolated from 50 mg of pooled larvae using the
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). For Atlantic
halibut larvae, RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen)
was used to isolate total RNA. Fish were transferred into a
1.5 ml microfuge tube with RLT buffer from the kit and
disrupted with a pellet pestle (Kimble-Kontes, Vineland,
NJ). The mixture was passed through 18- and 21-gauge
needles, to homogenize the sample and to reduce the viscosity. All RNA isolation procedures were performed in
accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. In all cases,
total RNA was treated twice with DNase I using the RNaseFree DNase kit (Qiagen) for 30 min for Senegalese sole or
DNA-free (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) for Atlantic halibut
in order to avoid amplification of genomic DNA. For Senegalese sole RNA, sample quality was checked using Experion (Bio-Rad) and quantification was performed
spectrophotometrically. Total RNA (1 µg) from each sample was reverse-transcribed using the iScript™ cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Lack of genomic
DNA contamination was confirmed by PCR amplification
of RNA samples in the absence of cDNA synthesis.

Real-time analysis was carried out on an iCycler (BioRad). Reactions were performed in a 25 µL volume containing cDNA generated from 10 ng of original RNA template, 300 nM each of specific forward (F) and reverse (R)
primers (Table 3), and 12.5 µl of iQ™ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Matching oligonucleotide primers were
designed using Oligo v6.89 software (Medprobe, Oslo,
Norway) or primer 3 (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical
Research). The amplification protocol used was as follows: initial 7 min denaturation and enzyme activation at
95°C, 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 70°C for 30 s, and
for Atlantic halibut, initial 7 min denaturation and
enzyme activation at 95°C, 40 cycles of 95°C for 20 s,
58°C for 20 s and 72°C for 20 s. Each assay was performed in duplicate. To estimate efficiencies, a standard
curve was generated for each primer pair based on known
quantities of cDNA (10-fold serial dilutions corresponding to cDNA transcribed from 100 to 0.01 ng of total
RNA). All calibration curves exhibited correlation coefficients higher than 0.99 and the corresponding real-time
PCR efficiencies were in the range 0.86–1.01 (Table 3).

In order to ensure comparability among data, the threshold values among plates were normalized by manually
setting the Ct values corresponding to at least two previous reference samples. Raw Ct values were transformed to
quantities using the comparative Ct method and specific
efficiencies [37]. Data obtained were converted into correct input files, according to the requirements of the software, and analyzed using geNorm [20], and NormFinder
[21].
