Genome-wide patterns of promoter sharing and
co-expression in bovine skeletal muscle

Abstract
Background: Gene regulation by transcription factors (TF) is species, tissue and time specific. To better understand
how the genetic code controls gene expression in bovine muscle we associated gene expression data from
developing Longissimus thoracis et lumborum skeletal muscle with bovine promoter sequence information.
Results: We created a highly conserved genome-wide promoter landscape comprising 87,408 interactions relating
333 TFs with their 9,242 predicted target genes (TGs). We discovered that the complete set of predicted TGs share
an average of 2.75 predicted TF binding sites (TFBSs) and that the average co-expression between a TF and its
predicted TGs is higher than the average co-expression between the same TF and all genes. Conversely, pairs of
TFs sharing predicted TGs showed a co-expression correlation higher that pairs of TFs not sharing TGs. Finally, we
exploited the co-occurrence of predicted TFBS in the context of muscle-derived functionally-coherent modules
including cell cycle, mitochondria, immune system, fat metabolism, muscle/glycolysis, and ribosome. Our findings
enabled us to reverse engineer a regulatory network of core processes, and correctly identified the involvement of
E2F1, GATA2 and NFKB1 in the regulation of cell cycle, fat, and muscle/glycolysis, respectively.
Conclusion: The pivotal implication of our research is two-fold: (1) there exists a robust genome-wide expression
signal between TFs and their predicted TGs in cattle muscle consistent with the extent of promoter sharing; and
(2) this signal can be exploited to recover the cellular mechanisms underpinning transcription regulation of muscle
structure and development in bovine. Our study represents the first genome-wide report linking tissue specific coexpression to co-regulation in a non-model vertebrate.

Background
The development of a complex eukaryote originates
with just a single cell. A few years later it culminates in
a functional organism possessing ~100 trillion cells
delineated into ~200 cell types co-ordinately arranged in
time and space [1]. A single genome, which is largely
static, orchestrates this remarkable event, which is
highly dynamic, - but it is still not known how. More
specifically, what genomic information turns the right
genes on at the right time and in the right place? This
problem can be framed in terms of the gene regulation
through the action of transcription factors (TFs) on
their target genes (TGs) - a well-documented mechanism by which the protein encoded by a TF gene accesses

the cell nucleus and binds to TF binding sites (TFBS),
located in the promoter region of a TG activating or
inhibiting its transcription. Importantly, such regulation
acts in a species-, tissue- and time-specific manner [2-4].
Based on such framework, many authors have exploited
the guilt-by-association heuristic by which genes regulated by the same TF are more likely to show co-expression correlation and, conversely, sets of genes showing an
extreme co-expression correlation are more likely to be
regulated by the same set of TFs. Inspired by such heuristic, a rational approach for exploiting this co-expression
phenomena and deciphering transcriptional regulation
activity involves the reverse-engineering of gene regulatory networks using network inference algorithms such
as (but not limited to) Bayesian networks [5], CLR [6];
ARACNE [7], and PCIT [8,9]. Ergün et al. [10] exploited
the connectivity structure of a gene network to an
expression data set and identified genetic drivers of prostate cancer using the so-called MNI algorithm [11].

Other authors [12-14] have undertaken a promoter
sequence analysis of a correlated group of genes to identify sequence motifs corresponding to TFBS. Using the
prediction of binding affinities of a TF to promoters,
Roider et al. [15] proposed a method for detecting TFs
associated with functional categories.
An equally commendable strategy relies on assigning
regulators to modules based on the co-expression
between a candidate regulator and each of the members
of the module. Examples of the latter approach include
the LeMoNe (Learning Module Networks) algorithm of
Joshi et al. [16] which generates a number of possible
models explaining regulation activity and with every single model containing many regulators. An alternative
method, initially introduced by Reverter et al. [17] and
more recently implemented in Hudson et al. [18], is
based on ranking TF by their absolute co-expression
correlation averaged across all genes in a given module.
More recently, our group [19] developed a metric,
namely RIF for regulatory impact factors, which ranked
TFs by analysing the extreme score to those TF that are
consistently most differentially co-expressed with the
highly abundant and highly differentially expressed
genes (RIF1), and to those TF with the most altered
ability to predict the abundance of differentially
expressed genes (RIF2).
In spite of this plethora of work aimed at identifying
the key TFs responsible for a phenotypic contrast of
interest (e.g. healthy versus disease), experimental validation linking co-expression with co-regulation remains
scarce and, by and large, available only for model organisms. For instance, based on 2,284 yeast genes and 106
TFs, Allocco et al. [20] investigated and quantified the
link between co-expression and co-regulation in yeast
and concluded that the correlation co-expression must
be greater than 0.84 in order for two genes to have a
greater than 50% chance of sharing a common TFBS.
Also working with 180 yeast TFs, Yu et al. [21] observed
that genes targeted by the same TF tend to be
co-expressed, with the degree of co-expression increasing if genes share more than one TF. The authors also
reported that targets of a given TF tend to have similar
cellular functions. Similarly, the relationship between
gene co-expression and co-regulation has been explored
in Drosophila melanogaster [22] and mouse [23]. However, given that only three-fifths of the transcriptional
networks are broadly conserved, and the associations
between TFs and their TGs are flexible [24], there is a
need to explore these matters in the actual organism,
and indeed preferably in the tissue of interest, rather
than making system-wide predictions based on the
closest model organism.
Furthermore, based on the observed relationship
between TFs and their TGs, some authors have studied

Page 2 of 13

gene regulatory networks for model organisms and
focussed on the hierarchical structure of the resulting
networks [25,26]. Only more recently, Hu and Gallo
[27] provide a catalogue of TF pairs, defined as those
with TFBS in the same promoter regions, for human
genes and in a tissue-specific manner. However, their
work is based on only 214 TF and the authors did not
investigate the relationship between TF pairs and coexpression of pairs of genes sharing TF pairs. In the
light of these shortcomings, it is apparent that more
research is needed to understand the relationship
between co-expression and co-regulation.
We have elected to focus our efforts on the development of skeletal muscle and the Longissimus thoracis et
lumborum (LTL) in particular. Skeletal muscle makes
up to 50% of the mass of most mammals and is the single largest tissue contributor to basal metabolism [28].
By merging transcriptional and regulatory information,
we aimed to shed light on a range of fundamental
hypotheses including: 1) That a relationship exists
between co-expression and co-regulation; 2) That the
way in which TFs partner with each other scales with
the number of common TGs and, in turn, influences
the amount of co-expression observed between the TFs;
and 3) That TFBS over-represented in the promoter
regions of functionally coherent gene modules allows for
the identification of TFs and TF networks that are consistent with the biological process of the module.
We first introduce a ‘Promoterome’ matrix (P-matrix)
relating TGs with predicted TFs. In combination with
the expression data, this matrix is used to test our first
two hypotheses (linking co-expression with co-regulation). We then generate a series of simulated datasets to
identify under which conditions, in terms of activation
and inhibition, the observed relationship between
co-expression and co-regulation can emerge. Finally, we
reverse-engineer a network of TFs and discuss its biological relevance in the context of functionally coherent
modules.

Results
The P-Matrix - A bovine muscle promoterome matrix
linking TFs with predicted TGs

We explored the 42,702,661 co-expression correlations
among the 9,242 genes of the P-matrix (Additional file
1). Of these, 63% and 37% were positive and negative,
respectively. We [18] and others [29-31] have reported a
higher reliability for positive correlations, in terms of
the ability to replicate them in other datasets, or the
results corresponding to validated interactions [32].
Figure 1A shows the histogram of the number of
TFBS in the promoter region of each of 9,242 genes.
95% of genes have between 3 and 21 TFBS. Figure 1B

common for all 42,702,661 gene pairs. 73% of gene pairs
have two or more predicted TFBSs in common. Also,
5% of gene pairs share at least 6 TFBSs suggesting these
to be components of highly co-regulated networks. Conversely, less than 10% of the gene pairs do not share any
TFBSs, suggesting that the vast majority of genes are
suitable for co-expression analysis. Figure 1C provides a
visual diagnosis of the scale-free behavior of the distribution of TFs as a function of the number of TGs. The
number of TGs ranged from 1 (for 48 TFs) to 7,288 (for
MZF1; myeloid zinc finger 1) and had a median of 14.
Figure 1D reveals an exponential saturation relationship
between the number of regulator partners and the number of TGs a given TF has.
Linking of co-expression, co-regulation and common
targets

Figures 2 provide a snapshot of the results relating
co-expression with shared TFBSs. We observed an increase
in the average co-expression correlation as the number of
common TFs increased (Figure 2A). This pattern was consistent irrespective of whether the absolute and positive

correlations were considered separately. However, this relationship was more apparent when only positive correlations were considered. For pairs of genes predicted to be
jointly targeted by 10 or more TFs, we found a 4% and a
6% increase in absolute and positive correlations respectively, compared with random pairs of genes (Figure 2A).
We also observed (Figure 2B) a strong monotonic
increase in the strength of the co-expression between a
TF pair and the number of TGs they share. To the best
of our knowledge, no study exists exploring this relationship. Among the 15,753 pairs existing from the 178
TFs with expression data, 4,880 where among TF pairs
sharing at least one TG. For these, the number of TGs
in common averaged 37 and ranged from 1 (for 1,439
TF pairs) to 5,857 (between MZF1 and TGIF1).
One final objective in exploring the relationship
between co-expression and co-regulation was to assess

Gu et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/23

Page 4 of 13

whether the average co-expression correlation between a
TF and its TGs is higher than the average co-expression
between the same TF and all genes in the dataset
(Figure 2D). Out of the 178 TFs with expression data,
108 (or 61%) showed a ratio >1, corresponding to a
cumulative binomial P-value of 0.001675. When this
relationship was limited to the 94 TFs for which their
absolute correlation co-expression with their TGs was
above average (the average being 0.4334), we found that
71 of them (or 76%) showed a ratio >1 (P-value =
1.13E-07). This distinction is of relevance because,
under the null hypothesis of no relationship, TFs showing extreme correlation with their TGs should also
show extreme correlation with all genes in the dataset.
On the superior reliability of positive co-expression
correlations

Table 1 provides further evidence that positive correlations are more reliable than negative ones. However,
when considering the correlation between a TF and its
TGs, and as noted by Yu et al. [33], the sign and magnitude of this correlation is dependant on the regulation
type (i.e. activator, repressor or dual) as well as on the
regulatory motif (i.e. feed forward, time-shifted, etc.).
Therefore, we conclude that using only positive or only
negative correlations diminishes the ability to capture
true TF - TG relationships and better results emerged
when all correlations are used in an absolute context.
Importantly, irrespective of which set was used, the evidence becomes more apparent when selecting TF - TG
relationships above average. This analysis also showed
that as TFs have more TGs the ratio of correlation of
the expression of the TFs with its TGs compared to all
genes converges to one (Figure 2D).
Simulation analyses reveal the most likely regulation type

As discussed by Yu et al. [21], there are two main reasons for regulation type to impact on the relationship of
the expression of their targets. One is that a sizeable
proportion of TFs act both as activators and repressors,
in some cases for the same target. The other is that the
combined effect of multiple TFs can have an unpredictable effect on target expression. Figure 3 illustrates the

function of the % of TFs with dual or bipotential activity; (B)
Simulation results at varying percentages of transcription factors (TF)

results from our simulation analyses. One prominent
feature is that in order to observe a relationship between
co-expression and co-regulation there must be a sizeable
proportion of TFs acting as either activators or repressors, but not both. In fact, the relationship between
co-expression and co-regulation quickly diminishes with
increasing proportion of TFs with bipotential activity
(activators and repressors) (Figure 3B). Most interestingly, in the extreme scenario where all TFs have bipotential activity, no relationship between co-expression
and co-regulation could be observed and the resulting
distribution of the correlations would be perfectly
centred at zero (Figure 3A, density shown in black).
Instead, such density sees its mass shifted towards the
positive space with an increasing proportion of TFs having a single regulation type (Figure 3A, densities shown
in colours other than black). We conclude that the
higher reliability attributed to positive correlations is a
phenomenon of the presence of significant number of
TFs that act as either general activators or general
repressors and that the co-expression to co-regulation
pattern observed from the real expression skeletal muscle dataset is consistent with the presence of 70 to 80%
of TFs having a bipotential activity (Figure 2C for real

data versus Figure 3B, purple and pink trends, for simulated data). In agreement with our findings, while on a
smaller scale, the recent work of Ouyang et al. [34] with
mouse embryonic stem cells, revealed that a remarkably
high proportion of variation in gene expression can be
explained by the binding signals of 12 TFs of which 7
(or 58%) serve as either activator or repressor depending
on the target.
Co-expression as a function of Transcriptional regulatory
motifs (TRM)

We used the log-odds ratio (LOD) to investigate the relationship between the co-expression correlation observed
for genes pairs and the number of shared TFs. We
observed that the LOD-value is dependent on the type of
transcriptional regulatory motifs (TRM n ) defining the
motif of n common TFs jointly regulating the same set of
TGs, and with n = 0, 1, 2,... up to n ≥ 10 (Additional File
2). These results corroborated and, to a degree, formally
validated our previous observation that gene pairs sharing TFBS showed an increased co-expression correlation
(Figure 2A). A similar result was observed for gene pairs
sharing from more than 1 to more than 10 TFBSs (Additional File 2). Again, the trend is more pronounced when
only positive correlations are considered, in line with a
higher reliability for positive correlations [32]. As
expected, the distribution of the co-expression correlations for pairs of genes with TRMs of 1, 5 or 10 genes
shows an increased bias to highly positive correlations
with increased size of the TRM (Figure 4B). Likewise,
extreme positive correlations (i.e. within the interval
{0.8,1.0}) are more frequent among high-order TRMs
than extreme negative correlations (i.e. within the interval {-1.0,-0.8}) (Additional File 2).
Derivation of a TF network for bovine skeletal muscle

We found 12, 13, 2, 9, 8, and 0 TFs whose TGs were
enriched for genes encoding proteins involved in cell cycle,
fat, immune, mitochondria, muscle/glycolysis, and the ribosome, respectively (Table 2 and Figure 4C-D). We used the
chi-square test of independence to ascertain if there exists
an independent pairing assortment in the resulting network
of 127 TF and 306 edges. The null hypothesis of independence was rejected (P-value = 2.8359E-62) and we concluded that our module assignment of TFs provided
information about the topology of the network.
The TF arrangements were further explored by converting them into a network (Figure 4A). This approach
assigned links between TFs predicted to regulate more
common targets than expected by chance alone. In
order to analyze the resulting network among 333 TF
connected by 1,395 edges, we focused on TF hubs
in the context of the functionally coherent modules
(Figure 4B). In brief, we exploited the muscle-based

Page 5 of 13

co-expression modules of Hudson et al. [18] to determine if they represented a robust enough set of TGs to
infer the regulation of the biological process in question
using promoter data only. To illuminate the relationship
between co-expression and the sharing of TGs among
TFs, we explored the network that resulted from linking
TF pairs with absolute co-expression correlation greater
than 0.9 and more than 100 TGs in common. This
approach resulted in 10 TFs connected by 10 edges and
with TGIF1 as the hub of the network (Figure 4D).

Discussion
Co-expression versus co-regulation and implications for
skeletal muscle

The resulting non-linear pattern observed when relating
the number of regulator partners and the number of
TGs a given TF has (Figure 1D) resonates with the
recent findings of Bhardwaj et al. [35] for model organisms and humans and indicates that only a limited number of partners are required to regulate an increasing
number of targets.
As co-expression correlation between a pair of TGs
increases, so does the number of common TFs (Figure
2C). Importantly, this relationship continues to trend
downwards in negatively co-expressed pairs of genes.
Our prior, and in hindsight naïve expectation, was that
pairs of genes with extreme negative correlations would
share a high number of TFs (overlaid red trend in Figure
2C). Our prior expectation was based on the redundancy
mechanism by which one of two genes involved in the
same process (and hence regulated by the same TF) suffices at any point in time. However, the observed trend
could also be reasoned from a mechanistic standpoint
such that in order for a gene pair to show a strong negative co-expression, then their regulators must be vastly
different (i.e., these two genes are more likely to be regulated by a completely different set of TFs). To elucidate
the most likely speculation, the exploration of various
regulation types in the TF - TG relationship in terms of
activation, repression or bi-potential, was warranted.
Our analyses also revealed that as TFs have more TGs
the ratio of correlation of the expression of the TFs
with its TGs compared to all genes converges to one
(Figure 2D). This is consistent with the expectation that
the more genes a TF regulates, the higher the likelihood
that their expression will be also regulated by other TFs.
An alternative explanation is that motifs comprised of a
single TF regulating many TGs (often refereed to as
SIM for single input motifs) can generate temporal programs of expression, in which TGs are activated one by
one in a defined order [36,37]. Such temporal order of
expression would imply that, at any given time point,
the TF - TG relationship could be observed only for
some of the TGs.

MYOD1, MYOG, MYF5 and MYF6 are generally not as

well-represented as we anticipated, although MYOG is in
18th place. Treating the positive and negative correlations
separately improves the representation of the MRF significantly, in that both MYOD1 (17th place) and MYOG
(3rd place) subsequently feature. We have previously

determined that of the various MRF only MYOD1 and
MYOG make it onto an “Always Correlated” network that
joins genes exhibiting strong co-expression.
With a special focus on the promoter regions shared
by the core muscle structural proteins we determined
enrichment for TF predicted to regulate those 66 molecules designated as either “fast”, “slow”, “embryonic” and
“other muscle structural” as listed in Table 2 of Hudson
et al.[18]. The strongest enrichment for this process corresponded to gene ontology term “response to retinoic
acid”, a feature shared by MZF1 (first with 41 promoter
hits), TGIF1 (second with 35 hits) and MASH1 (fifth
with 22 hits). Other TFs with strong hits included
FOXM1 (tenth with 14 hits), a generic cell cycle regulator. The presence of a cell cycle regulator is intriguing
given that a key feature of cells progressing through the
myogenic program is cell cycle arrest.
There was some evidence for enrichment of the TGF-b
signaling pathway, with predicted SMAD2 and SMAD3
binding sites featuring in the upstream regions of a number
of targets. MZF1 has been reported to bind to FHL3 (a component of the muscle z-disc) [38], which in turn has been
reported to signal via the SMADs [39]. Expression of TGIF1
is induced by TGF-b, has a predicted binding site upstream
of MSTN, and interacts with SMAD proteins [40].
A TF network for bovine skeletal muscle

The P-matrix was subjected to hierarchical cluster analyses. This approach clustered TFs predicted to regulate
common TGs, and TGs predicted to be regulated by
common TFs. We observed a strong clustering of a set
of HOX genes (HOXA1, HOXB13, HOXB4, HOXB9,
HOXC1 and HOXD13), which also included the homeobox gene, UNCX. This clustering probably relates to the
simple fact that many of the HOX genes are physical
neighbors on the genome, formed by relatively recent
gene duplication events. In this sense, they are a rare
example of physical proximity and shared functionality
in eukaryotic genomes [41]. We also observed a cluster
of mitochondrial proteins including NDUFA11 near
COX6A2 and COXA5, although given the size of the
data this may have been expected by chance alone.

The impact on the functionally coherent modules

The lack of enrichment for the ribosome module is consistent with ribosomal proteins being ubiquitously expressed
in all tissues and ribosomal RNA accounting for ~60% of
total RNA in the cell [42]. Overall, this approach enriched
for some of the known, experimentally-validated regulators, with the cell cycle module performing particularly
well. Given our ‘promoterome’ approach was predicated
on first screening for highly conserved cis-regulated modules across mammals, our particular success with the cell
cycle may reflect the observation that the cell cycle is
more evolutionary conserved than various other processes
[43]. For example, the behavior of E2F1, a causal regulator
of cell cycle activity [44], recapitulated both here and by
high co-expression alone is conserved across groups
including C. elegans and yeast.
In addition, amongst the module-specific and muscleexpressed TFs (bold-type in Table 2) we highlight
ARID5B and FOXM1, both with cell cycle genes significantly enriched among their targets. ARID5B is a member of the AT-rich interaction domain family of TFs,
which are known to be critically involved in the regulation of development and cellular differentiation [45].
Recent studies have reported a functional role for
FOXM1 in cell cycle [46] and for NFKB1 in muscle
[47]. Interestingly, FOXM1 expression is decreased after
the induction of fibroblast to myofibroblast transdifferentiation by TGF-b [48].
Equally suggestive is the significant enrichment of
genes from the mitochondrial module among the lists of
predicted TGs for MEF2C. Van Oort et al. [49] showed
that a subset of the genes activated by a dominant negative MEF2C construct in mice encoded proteins localized primarily to, or functioning at, the level of
mitochondria. In addition, RNAi silencing of MEF2C
expression in the cardiac muscle of mice reduced mitochondrial DNA levels [50]. The nuclear factor 1 (NF1)
family of TFs includes NFIX which has been found to
act as a transcriptional switch from embryonic to fetal
skeletal muscle development [51].
Only three TFs (ATF6, MEIS1 and NEUROG1) changed module allocation depending on the criteria used

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/23

(hypergeometric test or odds ratio; Table 2 vs Table 3).
ATF6 was allocated to cell cycle according to the hypergeometric test and to the fat module according to the
odds ratio. ATF6 is a master regulator of the unfolded
regulator response and has been implicated the regulation of lipid metabolism [52]. However, in this work the
regulation was via a protein-protein interaction with
SREBP2 without DNA binding. Similarly, MEIS1 was
allocated to the muscle/glycolysis and to the immune
module according to the hypergeometric and the odds
ratio tests, respectively. MEIS1 belongs in the family of
homeobox genes which play a crucial role in many
developmental processes. A search of the literature
indentified MEIS1 as a regulator of the immune system
[53-55] and myogenesis [56].
GATA-binding protein 2 (GATA2) was among the
TFs whose TGs were enriched for the fat module genes.
Tong et al. [57] discovered that GATA factors play a
key role in adipogenesis by suppressing promoters of
adipogenic factors including peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma (PPARG).
While the muscle module did not enrich for the
MRFs, the presence of SMAD2 and SMAD4 does implicate the TGF-b pathway, known to regulate muscle
mass in mammals. The presence of HIF1A, a hypoxia
responsive TF, does seem reasonable in a module that
contains many glycolysis genes i.e. an alternative energy
conversion pathway used in the absence of enough oxygen availability.

FUNCOUP tool [59]. In our landscape GLI2 was
directly linked to MYF5, with one gene in common, and
GLI1 was linked to MYF5 via HNF4A. The association
of GLI2 and MYF5 in the two datasets are based on
quite different types of relationships; GLI2 is required to
activate the expression of MYF5 [58], whereas our analysis is based on the predicted co-regulation of target
genes by GLI2 and MYF5. The correspondence in the
association between MYF5 and GLI2 also provides support that our approach is a useful addition to the toolbox of analysis methodologies to be used in the analysis
of gene expression data.

Conclusions
This work represents the first genome-wide analysis
linking tissue-specific co-expression patterns with cisgenomic logic in bovine, a non-model vertebrate. The
main finding is that extensive promoter sharing between
genes culminates in a detectable and robust co-expression signal, significantly above that which would be
expected by chance alone. One pivotal implication is
that a sizeable proportion of regulators acting as either
activators or repressors, but not both, is needed in order
to observe a relationship between co-expression and
co-regulation. Finally, we have shown that mining the
relationship between promoter sharing and co-expression
in the context of functionally coherent modules allows
for the identification of key regulators of those modules.

Gene expression dataset

An additional correctly inferred regulator of the muscle/
glycolysis module genes is GLI1 [58]. Inspired by the
work of McDermott et al. [58], who showed that Gli
proteins directly control MYF5 expression in mouse
muscle progenitor cells, we used our TF network to
determine the links between the Gli TFs (GLI1, GLI2
and GLI3), and the myogenic regulatory factor MYF5
(Figure 5A). For comparison, Figure 5B shows the network among the same TFs in human and based on

(hence, 6 experimental conditions comprised of 3 time
points × 2 nutrition treatments). The entire gene
expression dataset comprising 48 microarrays has been
deposited into Gene Expression Omnibus http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ and can be accessed using accession number GSE25554.
Following previously described approaches [60], we
fitted the following ANOVA mixed-effect model to normalize the gene expression data:
Yikvmn = μ + C ik + G m + AG im + DG km + VG vm + e ikvmn (1)

where Yikvmn represents the n-th background-adjusted,
base-2 log-intensity from the m-th gene (m = 1, 2, ...,
13094 probes), at the v-th experimental condition variety
(v = 1, 2, ..., 26) taken from the i-th array (i = 1, 2, ..., 48
microarray chips), and k-th dye channel; μ is the overall
mean; C represents a comparison group fixed effect
defined as those intensities that originate from the same
microarray slide, printing block and dye channel; G
represents the random gene (or probe) effects with
13,094 levels; AG, DG, and VG are the random interaction effects of array × gene, dye × gene, and variety ×
gene, respectively; and e is the random error term. Using
standard stochastic assumptions, the effects of G, AG,
DG, VG and e were assumed to follow a normal distribution with zero mean and between-gene, between-gene
within-array, between-gene within-dye, between-gene
within-variety and within-gene components of variance,
respectively. Restricted maximum likelihood estimates of
variance components and solutions to model effects were
obtained using VCE6 software ftp://ftp.tzv.fal.de/pub/
vce6/. The solutions to the VG effect were used as the
normalized mean expression of each gene (or probe) in
each of the 26 experimental conditions under scrutiny.
Promoter sequence analysis

The genome-wide promoter sequence data for bovine
was downloaded from Genomatix database http://www.
genomatix.de/ (ElDorado Btau 4, v-07-09). A total of
60,131 promoter sequences derived from 22,050 genes
were downloaded. We introduced several filtering steps
to ensure only high confidence promoter sequences are
selected for the analysis. First, we applied the concept of
orthologous promoters [61] and retained only those promoter sequences for which phylogenetically conserved
promoter sequences were documented in the human
and mouse genomes. Using this criterion we retained
39,696 promoter sequences distributed over 13,623
genes. In the next step, we applied a threshold of 1
(100% confidence) to core and matrix similarities [62].
These editing criteria resulted in a total of 310,316 high
confidence TFBS that were used for integration with the
gene expression data.

The Promoterome Matrix

We built a ‘Promoterome’ matrix (P-matrix) relating
predicted TGs with TFs based on TFBSs located in their
promoter regions. The rows of P-matrix correspond to
TGs for which expression data is available, and the
columns correspond to TF genes retrieved from the
Genomatix database. We identified 9,242 genes (rows of
P-matrix) whose promoter sequence (or sequences) harbours at least one predicted TFBS corresponding to at
least one of the 333 TFs (columns of P-matrix). The element P(i,j) of P-matrix is set to “1” if a promoter region
of the i-th TG contains a TFBS corresponding to the jth TF, otherwise is set to “0”. Among the 333 TFs represented in the columns of P-matrix, there were 178 with
expression in the Hudson et al. [18] dataset, including
143 with promoter region information in Genomatix
(i.e. these 143 TFs were also represented among the
rows of P-matrix). We used PermutMatrix [63] to visualise and analyse the resulting P-matrix (See Additional
file 1). In addition, the cross-product matrix resulting
from multiplying the P-matrix by its transpose, results
in a square and symmetric matrix, P TP, of dimension
equal to 333 (i.e. the number of TFs). Diagonal values of
PTP matrix (PTP(j,j)) correspond to the number of TGs
for the j-th TF. Off-diagonal values of P T P (P T P(j,j’))
correspond to the number of promoter regions in which
the TFBS for the j-th and the j’-th TF co-occur.
Co-occurrence is used to build a network of TFs. The
hierarchical tree shows a pattern consistent with the
non-random assortment of the connectivity distribution
with most TFs having few TGs and few TFs having
lots of TGs and consistent with a scale-free power-law
distribution [64,65].
Statistical significance in the co-expression to coregulation relationship

Following Yu et al. [21], we used the log odds ratio
(LOD) to ascertain the enrichment of a particular TF TG relationship with respect to random expectation for
the occurrence of the observed co-expression and
according to the following formulae:
⎡ P(coexpression/regulation) ⎤
LOD = ln ⎢
⎥
P(coexpression)
⎣
⎦

(2)

where P(co-expression/regulation) is the probability of
gene pairs with certain regulatory relationship (e.g. sharing the same predicted TFBS) showing a specific correlation co-expression; and P(co-expression) is the
probability of randomly selected gene pairs having the
same co-expression correlation. LOD values above zero
signify observations that are more common than
expected by chance, and vice versa.

Simulation schema

TF network

In order to gain further insights into the mechanistic
rules governing the observed relationship between coexpression and co-regulation, we generated a series of
simulated datasets under various scenarios. Source code
in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc.) was developed for
the simulation schema. In our simulation process a
given TF was allowed to act as “dual” (i.e., acting as
both activator and repressor of its TGs) or “mono” (i.e.,
either activator or repressor of its TGs, but not both).
In detail, our simulation process followed the following
schema:
Step1: Define the input vector D(k) representing the
percentage of TFs with “dual” behavior. In detail, D(k) =
(k-1) × 10, for k = 1, 2, ..., 11. That is, D was allowed to
range from 0% to 100%, by 10% increment.
Step2: At the r-th iteration (for r = 1 to 93), select a
total 100 TGs from P-matrix (i.e., 100 rows of P). Selection is at random and without replacement, ensuring
with r = 93 that all rows of P were sampled.
Step3: Randomly assign the 333 TFs from the Pmatrix as follows: D(k) percentage of TFs are set with
dual characteristic while the rest are set with 4 “mono”
behaviors in equal amounts: activator, repressor, strong
activator, strong repressor.
Step4: For the regulation mechanism, allow 5 values
of activation/repression as follows: V = {-6,-3,0,+3,+6},
where 0 indicates the (lack of) impact of a TF to a nonTG, ± 3 for moderate activator (+3) or moderate repressor (-3), and ± 6 for strong activator (+6) or strong
repressor (-6) regulation. These values correspond to
either one (± 3) or two (± 6) standard deviation units
(see next).
Step5: Simulate the expression data at 334 time points
corresponding to Time 0 and up to Time 333 for each
consecutive TF. In order to approximate the distributional properties of the real data, the expression data for
the 100 TGs at Time 0 was simulated at random from a
normal distribution with a mean of 9 and a variance of
9 (i.e. N(9,9)), and truncated at 0 and 18, as lower and
upper bounds, respectively.
At Time t (t = 1, 2, ..., 333), the j-th TF (where j = t;
hence as many time points as TFs) comes into action
and the expression of the i-th TG is be modified according to the value of V. At Time 333, each of the 100 TGs
has expression data at 334 dimensions (or time points).
Step6: Return to Step2 until the k percentage levels
and all 9,242 TGs from P-matrix have been explored.
During the simulation process, we also considered the
situation in which TFs came into action in groups of
five (i.e. having 20 groups from the 100 TFs considered
in each iteration). However, the results did not differ
from those obtained using the one-at-a-time scenario
described above.

The strength of the similarity existing for a given TF
pair can be inferred from the number of common TGs.
We used the columns of P-matrix as the input for the
PCIT algorithm [8] to generate a network of TFs. The
resulting network contained 333 nodes (i.e. as many as
TFs) linked by 1,395 edges. Edges in the network link
TFs predicted to share a significantly large number of
targets. Consistent with a non-random assortment in
the connectivity distribution, the 10 most connected
TFs (i.e. ~3% of the total 333 TFs), referred to as ‘hub’
TFs, had at least 17 connections each, and were connected to 196 TFs (i.e. ~60% of the total).
Gene modules and significance of TF to module
assortment

The functional modules that emerged in the landscape
of Hudson et al. [18]were subjected to further scrutiny
to generate a curated list of module genes (Additional
file 3). This additional examination was based on gene
proximity in the hierarchical cluster analysis according
to the PermutMatrix software [63] as well as on the
molecular function gene ontology term http://www.geneontology.org.
We focused our attention on six modules as follows:
cell cycle, fat, immune, mitochondria, muscle/glycolysis,
and the ribosome. These modules were chosen for their
likely roles in the determination of muscle mass, intramuscular fat development and energetic efficiency.
The enrichment of the affinity between the TFs and
the functionally coherent modules was explored by
means of the hypergeometric test of significance. To
this respect, for every TF - Module combination, we calculated the probability of having the observed number
of module genes among its targets using the following
hypergeometric equation:
⎛ mk
⎜
⎜ mj
H( j , k ) = ⎝

⎞ ⎛ N − mk
⎟⎜
⎟⎜ nj − mj
⎠⎝
⎛N⎞
⎜ ⎟
⎜ nj ⎟
⎝ ⎠

⎞
⎟
⎟
⎠

(3)

where N is the total number of genes (9,242), nj is the
total number of TGs for the j-th TF, mk is the number
of genes in the k-th module and m j is the number of
TG of the j-th TF belonging to the k-th module.
Those TFs with H(j,k) <5% and a proportion (mj/nj)/
(mk/N) >1 are referred to as ‘module-specific’ TFs. The
second condition represents an odds ratio and was
applied to account for low hypergeometric probabilities
resulting from under-enrichment (i.e. those TFs with a
proportion of module genes among their targets less
than the proportion of module genes among all genes).

Gu et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/23

Finally, among ‘module-specific’ TF, we classify as ‘module-specific and expressed’ TF to refer to those for
which expression data is available. These criteria
resulted in 44 ‘module-specific’ TFs of which 32 were
‘module-specific and expressed’ TFs (Table 2).
The odds ratio criteria resulted in 127 out of 333 TFs
being allocated to one of the six modules (Table 3). In
order to ascertain if this module assignment of TFs provided information about the topology of the network we
tested if there exists an independent pairing assortment
in the resulting network of 127 TFs and 306 edges
using the chi-square test of independence (P-value =
2.8359E-62).
