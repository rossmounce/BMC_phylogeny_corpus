Abstract
Background: Turbot reddish body iridovirus (TRBIV) causes serious systemic diseases with high mortality in the
cultured turbot, Scophthalmus maximus. We here sequenced and analyzed the complete genome of TRBIV, which was
identified in Shandong province, China.
Results: The genome of TRBIV is a linear double-stranded DNA of 110,104 base pairs, comprising 55% G + C. Total 115
open reading frames were identified, encoding polypeptides ranging from 40 to 1168 amino acids. Amino acid
sequences analysis revealed that 39 of the 115 potential gene products of TRBIV show significant homology to other
iridovirus proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of conserved genes indicated that TRBIV is closely related to infectious spleen
and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV), rock bream iridovirus (RBIV), orange-spotted grouper iridovirus (OSGIV), and large
yellow croaker iridovirus (LYCIV). The results indicated that TRBIV belongs to the genus Megalocytivirus (family
Iridoviridae).
Conclusions: The determination of the genome of TRBIV will provide useful information for comparative study of
Megalocytivirus and developing strategies to control outbreaks of TRBIV-induced disease.
Background
Iridoviruses are large, icosahedral, double-stranded DNA
(dsDNA) viruses that can infect invertebrates and poikilothermic vertebrates, including insects, fish, amphibians, and reptiles. The viral genomes are both circularly
permuted and terminally redundant, which is a unique
feature among eukaryotic virus genomes [1-5]. Additionally, iridoviruses infect vertebrates have highly methylated genomes [2,6,7]. Based on particle size, host range,
DNA cross-hybridization, the presence of a methyltransferase, and the major capsid protein (MCP) sequence, Iridoviruses are classified into five genera: Iridovirus,
Chloriridovirus, Ranavirus, Lymphocystivirus, and Megalocytivirus. Currently, the entire genomes of more than
ten iridoviruses have been completely sequenced. These
viruses include lymphocystis disease virus 1 (LCDV-1)
and LCDV-China (LCDV-C) of the genus Lymphocystivi* Correspondence: huangjie@ysfri.ac.cn

rus; tiger frog virus (TFV), frog virus 3 (FV-3), Ambystoma tigrinum virus (ATV), and Singapore grouper
iridovirus (SGIV) of the genus Ranavirus; infectious
spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV), orange-spotted grouper iridovirus (OSGIV), rock bream iridovirus
(RBIV), large yellow croaker iridovirus (LYCIV), red sea
bream iridovirus (RSIV) of the genus Megalocytivirus;
IIV-3 (or Invertebrate iridescent virus 3) of the genus
Chloriridovirus; and IIV-6 (or Chilo iridescent virus) of
the genus Iridovirus [6,8-17]. The genomes of these iridoviruses range in size from 105,057 bp (TFV) to 212,482
bp (IIV-6), encoding from 96 to 234 potential open reading frames (ORFs), with G+C contents ranging from 27 to
55%, and complex repeat sequences are very common in
these genomes. The genomes exhibit little to no colinearity among genera.
Turbot, Scophthalmus maximus, is an important aquaculture species in coastal areas of northern China. The
annual production value of farmed turbot in China
achieved US$400 million in 2006. Recently, more and
more epizootic diseases of farmed turbot in China
occurred because of high density stocking and improper

management. In 2004, a fish disease causing high mortality and severe damage to turbot cultures was reported in
China [18]. The histopathology of the viral infection was
characterized by cell hypertrophy in the spleen, kidney,
cranial connective tissue, and endocardium. The causative agent was confirmed to be an iridovirus-like virus
based on microscopic examination and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). The virus was then classified
as an iridovirus and named as turbot reddish body iridovirus (TRBIV) [18]. As the disease was important to
turbot culture, we have analyzed and molecularly characterized the complete genome of TRBIV. We also performed phylogenetic analysis of selected TRBIV proteins
compared with those of other iridoviruses and discussed
the taxonomic position of TRBIV. The determination of
whole genome of TRBIV will provide useful information
for comparative study of Megalocytivirus and developing
strategies to control outbreaks of TRBIV-induced disease.

bp), RSIV (112,414 bp) and OSGIV (112,636 bp) [13-15].
Comparing with other sequenced iridoviruses, the size of
TRBIV genome was higher than that of LCDV-1 (102,653
bp), TFV (105,057 bp), FV-3 (105,903 bp), ATV (106,332
bp), but smaller than that of SGIV (140,131 bp), LCDV-C
(186,250 bp), and much smaller than that of CIV (212,482
bp) [6,8-12,17]. The G + C content of the TRBIV genome
was similar to those of ISKNV (54.8%), OSGIV (54%),
RBIV (53%), FV-3 (55%), TFV (55%), ATV (54%), and
SGIV (48.64%), but much higher than that of LCDV-1
(29.1%), LCDV-C (27.25%) and CIV (28.6%) (Table 1).
The TRBIV genome contained numerous short direct,
inverted, and palindromic repetitive sequences. The
highly (direct) repetitive region was identified at position
23,512 to 23,762 bp in the TRBIV genome, which was
also found in ISKNV and OSGIV [14,15]. The highly
(direct) repetitive region showed highly homologies to
the repetitive regions of ISKNV (78%) and OSGIV (78%).

Results and discussion

Coding capacity of TRBIV genome

Determination of the viral genomic DNA sequence

PCR was performed using primers - MCP-irido5: 5'
GGAAGCTTCAAGTGAGGAGCG TGA 3' and MCPirido6: 5' GGGAATTCACAGGATAGGGAAGCC 3',
which were designed based on the MCP of SBIV by Sudthongkong et al. [19] has and have been used to amplify
the C terminal of coding region of SBIV, RSIV, GSDIV,
ALIV and DGIV to detect diseased turbot. Sequencing of
the PCR products revealed that the region of TRBIV
showed a high degree of sequence identity to SBIV (98%),
RSIV (98%), GSDIV (98%), ALIV (98%), DGIV (98%) and
RBIV (97%), the identities of the amino acid sequence
were also higher than those of the other iridoviruses, such
as CIV, MIV, TFV, FV-3, LCDV, LCDV-1, ATV, GIV, and
SGIV. Subsequently, with the completion of the sequencing of the MCP and ATPase of TRBIV, the sequence analysis results indicated that TRBIV was much more closely
related to RSIV, ISKNV, RBIV, OSGIV and LYCIV than to
other iridoviruses. We then designed a primer pairs based
on the conserved genes of ISKNV, OSGIV, and RBIV, to
amplify the TRBIV genome. The amplified PCR products
were approximately 2,000 ~ 6,000 bp in length. The initial
PCR products were designed to have at least 200 bp of
overlapping sequence. The PCR products were cloned
into vector pMD18-T and sequenced in both directions
with the universal forward and reverse M13 primers
using an ABI PRISM 3700 automated DNA sequencer.
Finally, about 6× coverage of the TRBIV genome
sequence was accomplished.
The TRBIV genome contained a double-stranded DNA
consisting of 110,104 bp, with a G + C content of 55%.
Among the sequenced Megalocytivirus, the size of
TRBIV genome was the smallest, comparing with that of
ISKNV (111,362 bp), LYCIV (111,760 bp), RBIV (112,080

The prediction of presumptive genes was carried out
using the DS GENE 1.5 viral gene prediction program
(Accelrys Inc.) and NCBI ORF finder http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html. A total of 115 presumptive ORFs were identified, encoding proteins ranging from 40 to 1,168 amino acids on the sense (R) and
antisense (L) DNA strands (Fig. 1 and Additional file 1).
The percent coding density of TRBIV is 92%, which is
similar to ISKNV (93%), OSGIV (91%), and RBIV (86%)
[13-15]. Of the 115 ORFs, 65 (56.5%) were encoded by
ORFs present in the forward orientation and 50 (43.5%)
in the reverse. The 115 ORFs contained 26 core genes
that can be found in all iridoviral genomes [20].
There are 17 pairs of overlapping ORFs in the TRBIV
genome. Eleven of these 17 pairs of ORFs have an overlapping of 1 ~ 7 bp. This is similar to ISKNV (ORF 39R
and 40L, 45L and 46L, 80L and 81R, 86L and 87R), RBIV
(45L and 46L, 57L and 58L), OSGIV (ORF12L and
ORF13L, ORF28R and ORF29L, ORF37L and ORF38R,
ORF41R and ORF42L, ORF47L and ORF48L, ORF49R
and ORF50R, ORF60L and ORF61L, ORF68L and
ORF68R, ORF76R and ORF77R, ORF89R and ORF90L,
ORF107RL and ORF108L), ATV (ORF 6R and 6bR, 43R
and 43bR, 61R and 61bR), and SGIV (ORF1L and 2R, 7L
and 8L, 12L and 13R) [10,11,13-15].
Comparison to other iridoviruses isolated from fish

TRBIV is similar to three other Megalocytiviruses
(ISKNV, OSGIV and RBIV) in overall genome structure
and exhibited colinearity among them. An analysis of the
amino acid sequences deduced from the individual ORFs
revealed that 23 of ORFs were the same as the ORFs of
ISKNV, OSGIV, RBIV in size and orientation, with
homologies ranging from 85% to 99% at the amino acid

level. 94, 105 and 111 ORFs of TRBIV had homologies to
those of RBIV (58-100%), ISKNV (66-100%) and OSGIV
(66-100%) at the amino acid level [13-15]. Comparing
TRBIV with ISKNV, 42 ORFs were the same size and the
identities ranged from 84% to 99%. Comparing TRBIV
and OSGIV, 37 of the 115 ORFs were the same size and
their identities varied from 87% to 99%; 35 of the 115
ORFs differed in size with identities raging from 66% to
99%. Comparing TRBIV and RBIV, 30 ORFs were the
same size and the identities ranged from 77% to100%.
The complete sequence of TRBIV was compared to all
iridovirus sequences available in the data banks. The
result showed that the putative gene products of TRBIV
shared high homology to the corresponding viral proteins
of other iridoviruses (Additional file 1). There are 26 core
genes which can be found in all iridovirus genomes, such
as Serine/threonine protein kinases, DNA polymerase
(DdDP), DNA methyl transferase (DMet), SNF2-like helicase, DNA repair protein (RAD2), large subunits of
DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (DdRPI and DdRPII),
RNase III (RIII), ATPase and MCP. These genes are
involved in virus replication, transcription, modification,
and structural composition.
Sequence similarities to proteins in databases

The deduced gene products of the 115 ORFs were compared to amino acid sequences by the NCBI BLAST program http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/. Thirty-nine
ORFs showed significant homology to functionally characterized proteins from other species. These proteins
included structural proteins and enzymes involved in
virus replication, transcription, protein modification, and
virus-host interaction (Additional file 1).

DNA replication and repair

The TRBIV genome contained several genes with predicted roles in viral DNA replication, modification, and
processing, such as DNA polymerase (ORF20R), DNA
repair protein RAD2 (ORF27L), cytosine DNA methyl
transferase (ORF45L), putative replication factor
(ORF56L), SNF2 family helicase (ORF 58L), and D5 family NTPase (ORF99L). These ORFs showed 94 ~ 98%
identity to those of ISKNV, OSGIV, and RBIV at the
amino acid level.
TRBIV ORF45L encoded a homolog of cytosine DNA
methyltransferase. High levels of methylation of cytosine
at CpG residues were identified in iridoviruses from vertebrate hosts, such as FV3, LCDV-1, EHNV, ISKNV, TFV
and OSGIV [7,15,20-22]. DNA methylation is carried out
by a group of enzymes called DNA methyltransferases.
These enzymes not only determine the DNA methylation
patterns during early development, but are also responsible for copying these patterns to the strands generated
from DNA replication. In vertebrate iridoviruses, methyltransferases might play a crucial role in the expression of
the viral genome [7].
TRBIV ORF20R encoded a protein showing significant
similarity to DNA polymerase. DNA polymerase catalyzes the polymerization of deoxyribonucleotides into a
DNA strand. DNA polymerases are best known for their
role in DNA replication. Like other DNA polymerases,
ORF20R consisted of 3'-5'exonuclease and polymerization motifs located at the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the protein. These highly conserved motifs are
important characteristics of the enzyme [23,24].

Figure 1 Organization of the TRBIV genome. Arrows indicate the location, orientation and putative size of each ORF. White arrows represent ORFs
with predicted function similar to other organisms, and black arrows represent ORFs with unknown function.

Transcription and nucleotide metabolism

TRBIV encodes at least six enzymes that are involved in
transcription and nucleotide metabolism. They are ribonucleotide reductase small subunit (ORF25R), two large
subunits of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(ORF28L, ORF33R), transcription elongation factor IIS

(TFIIS, ORF29L), mRNA capping enzyme (ORF59L), and
ribonuclease III (ORF80L). These genes of TRBIV are
similar to those found in ISKNV and they showed 95 ~
96% amino acid sequence identities.
TFIIS is ubiquitous in many organisms and plays an
important role in transcript elongation [25,26]. Stage and

Shi et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:159

tissue-specific gene expression is an initial and important
step in establishing the fate of each cell during development. Expression of particular genes or gene families
could be regulated by tissue-specific S-II at the level of
transcriptional elongation [27].
Host-related functions

TRBIV encodes at least 15 proteins involved in hostrelated functions. ORF12R, 60L, 61L, 90L and 110R
encode proteins of various sizes, which contain a RINGfinger-containing ubiquitin ligase domain. They are
highly homologous to those of ISKNV (ORF12R, 65L,
66L, 99L, and 119R). The study on Ring finger proteins
(RFPs) showed that the four RFPs of ISKNV (ORF12R,
65L, 66L, and 111L) acted as the E3 enzyme in the presence of ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin, zinc
ions, and a specific E2 protein (UbcH5 subfamily). The
RING domain of RFP in ISKNV (ORF66L) was proved to
be essential for the activity of E3 enzyme by mutational
analysis [28].
ORF36L encoded a protein of 449 amino acids that
showed homology to ORF37L of LYCIV, containing a biologically active RGD tri-peptide. The RGD-containing
proteins have been identified to be involved in virus
infection and virus-host interaction by their RGD motif
interaction with the host cell surface receptors. The study
on 37L of LYCIV suggested that it had an important role
in virus infection [29-33].
ORF47R, which showed homology to the ORF48R of
ISKNV, showed higher similarity to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) encoded by Megalocytivirus
and Parapoxvirus than to those encoded by fish and
mammals. VEGF functions as a specific mitogen for vascular endothelial cells and as a potent inducer of vascular
permeability. The study on ORF48R of ISKNV demonstrated that ISKNV ORF48R functions as a potent growth
factor to stimulate angiogenesis and can bind its receptor,
FLK-1, to affect zebra fish early embryonic vascular
development [34].
In addition, some important putative genes involved in
host-related function were found in the TRBIV genome,
such as ankyrin repeat motifs (ORF70R, 93R, 109L,
115L), the C-terminal domain (CTD)-like phosphatase
(ORF5L), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (ORF9R), Src
homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein, laminintype epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain
(ORF24R), and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated
factor (TRAF, ORF101L).
Putative membrane-associated proteins

The ORFs of TRBIV were analyzed for the presence of
putative transmembrane domains (TMs). One or more
putative TMs (1 ~ 11) were found in five ORFs (ORF1L,
7L, 11L, 48L, 84R, 112L), using the computer software

Page 5 of 9

TMHMM 2.0 [35]. ORF1L exhibited high homology to
the amino acid sequences of ORF1L of ISKNV and
OSGIV [14,15]. ORF1L of ISKNV, containing 10 ~ 11
putative transmembrane domains, is a membrane protein
and is considered to serve as a model for analyzing the
topology and roles of different hydrophobic regions in
multi-transmembrane proteins [36].
Other proteins

TRBIV also encoded proteins homologous to a phosphatase (ORF107R), an ATPase (ORF113R) and a structural protein (MCP, ORF6L). ORF6L encoded a protein of
453 amino acids, which showed similarity to MCP of
other iridoviruses (i.e., RSIV, DGIV, RBIV, SBIV, OSGIV,
and ISKNV) [14,19].
Relationship of TRBIV to ISNNV, OSGIV and RBIV

The comparative analysis of the TRBIV, ISKNV, OSGIV
and RBIV genomes revealed many homologues (Additional file 1). Many ORFs of the four iridovirus genomes,
including the conserved genes and other ORFs of
unknown function, were similar in size, structure and
composition. Total 94, 105 and 111 ORFs of TRBIV had
homologies to those of RBIV (58-100%), ISKNV (66100%), and OSGIV (66-100%) at the amino acid level [1315]. Twenty-three ORFs of TRBIV had same size and the
identities varied from 85% to 99%.
DNA dot matrix analyses of TRBIV genomic DNA with
itself, ISKNV, OSGIV and the RBIV genome were performed using DS GENE 1.5 (Accelrys Inc.). The results
revealed that the gene order among TRBIV, ISKNV,
OSGIV and RBIV was markedly conserved (Fig. 2).
There are many different genes compared with ISKNV,
OSGIV and RBIV in the non-coding region and coding
region of TRBIV, including gene insertions and deletions
(results not shown). Interestingly, there is an obvious
gene deletion of about 1070bp compared with ISKNV at
position 67468 ~ 67518 of TRBIV, but hardly any difference with OSGIV and RBIV. The differences of the genes
among the three viruses reflect their host specificities.
Relationship of TRBIV to other iridoviruses

Iridovirus sequences available in data banks were compared to the complete sequence of TRBIV. The result
showed that the putative gene products of TRBIV shared
high homology to the corresponding viral proteins of
other iridoviruses (Additional file 1). There were some
homologous genes in the ISKNV, OSGIV, RBIV, TFV, FV3, ATV, SGIV, LCDV-1 and LCDV-C genomes. These
included genes for DNA polymerase (DdDP), DNA
methyl transferase (DMet), two large subunits of DNAdependent RNA polymerase (DdRPI and DdRPII), RNase
III (RIII), ATPase and MCP, involved in virus replication,
transcription, modification, and structural composition.

sequences were aligned using DS GENE 1.5.

Phylogenetic analysis

To determine the phylogenetic relationship of TRBIV to
other iridoviruses, the amino acid sequences of MCP,
ATPase, cytosine DNA methyl transferase and DNA
polymerase were used in alignments with other iridoviruses and non-iridoviruses from GenBank. MCP is highly
conserved in iridoviruses [37,38]. In the MCP tree, the
iridoviruses used in the multiple alignments were subdivided into four groups: group I, Lymphocystiviruses,
including LCDV-1 and LCDV-C; group II, the insect iri-

doviruses, including CIV, MIV; group III, Megalocytiviruses, including TRBIV, ISKNV, OSGIV, RBIV; and group
IV, Ranaviruses, including FV3, TFV, ATV, GIV and
SGIV (Fig. 3A). The results showed that TRBIV was more
closely related to ISKNV, OSGIV and RBIV, than to the
Ranavirus and Lymphocystiviruses. Phylogenetic analyses

also supported the view that TRBIV was more closely
related to ISKNV, OSGIV and RBIV.

Conclusions
In summary, the present study provided the complete
genome sequence of TRBIV. The genomic organization,
gene content, and amino acid composition of TRBIV are
very similar to those of ISKNV, OSGIV and RBIV. Dot
plot analyses and phylogenetic trees suggested that
TRBIV belongs to the genus Megalocytivirus in the family
Iridoviridae. The detailed viral genome analysis will provide valuable information to serve as the genetic basis for
future studies and to control iridovirus disease in cultured fish.
Methods
Infected fish

TRBIV used in this study was originally isolated from cultured turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) with TRBIV disease from Shandong Province, China, in 2005. These fish
had enlarged spleen and kidney cells, as verified by histopathology. The spleens and kidneys were removed from
the diseased fish and the viruses were observed by light
and electron microscopy. PCR was performed for further
confirmation of the disease. These samples were collected and kept at -80°C for future use.
Virus and viral DNA

Total DNA was extracted from spleen and kidney of diseased turbot using high pure PCR template preparation
kit (Roche, USA). The quality and concentration were
determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and by a spectrophotometer.
PCR amplification and sequencing

The complete genomic DNA of TRBIV was sequenced by
PCR method. As TRBIV showed high homology to
ISKNV, RBIV, and OSGIV, the primers were derived from
the DNA sequence of ISKNV, RBIV, and OSGIV in GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ database (AF371960, AY532606,
AY894343). Amplified PCR products were about 2000 ~
6000 bp in length, and the initial PCR products were
designed to have at least 200 bp of overlapping sequence.
The PCR products were purified using TaKaRa Agarose
Gel DNA Purification Kit Ver.2.0 (TaKaRa). The purified
PCR products were cloned into vector pMD18-T
(TaKaRa), and sequencing was performed using an ABI
PRISM 3700 automated DNA sequencer in both directions with the universal forward and reverse M13 primers.
DNA sequence analysis

Genomic DNA composition, structure, homologous
regions and repeated sequences were analyzed using
DNASTAR (Lasergene) and OMIGE 2.0 programs. The

ORFs and their amino acid sequences were predicted
using DS GENE 1.5 (Accelrys Inc.) and NCBI ORF finder
Protein
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html.
database searches were conducted using the BLASTP at
NCBI Web site http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. Comparison of the homologous sequence regions of TRBIV,
ISKNV, OSGIV, RBIV, LYCIV and other iridoviruses was
performed with BLAST programs. DNA dot matrix plots
were obtained using DS GENE 1.5 (Accelrys Inc.). Phylogenetic trees were generated using the PHYLIP package
and TreeView. Prediction of transmembrane domains
(TMs) was performed using TMHMM 2.0 http://
www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0/[35,39].
ORFs were identified by the following criteria: (1) they
were not less than 120 bp and (2) they were not located
within larger ORFs. In addition, TRBIV ORFs that were
likely to be expressed were also identified on the basis of
significant identity to known protein sequences within
the databases.
Nucleotide sequence accession number

The complete nucleotide sequence of the TRBIV genome
was deposited in GenBank under accession number:
GQ273492.
