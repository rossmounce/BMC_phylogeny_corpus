Abstract
Background: Being born in winter and spring is considered one of the most robust
epidemiological risk factors for schizophrenia. The aetiology and exact timing of this birth excess,
however, has remained elusive so far. Since during phylogeny, Borrelia DNA has led to multiple
germ-line mutations within the CB1 candidate gene for schizophrenia, a meta analysis has been
performed of all papers on schizophrenic birth excesses with no less than 3000 cases each. All
published numerical data were then plotted against the seasonal distributions of Ixodes ticks
worldwide.
Results: In the United States, Europe and Japan the birth excesses of those individuals who later
in life develop schizophrenia mirror the seasonal distribution of Ixodes ticks nine months earlier at
the time of conception. South of the Wallace Line, which limits the spread of Ixodes ticks and
Borrelia burgdorferi into Australia, seasonal trends are less significant, and in Singapore, being nonendemic for Ixodes ticks and Lyme disease, schizophrenic birth excesses are absent.
Conclusion: At present, it cannot be excluded that prenatal infection by B. burgdorferi is harmful
to the implanting human blastocyst. The epidemiological clustering of sporadic schizophrenia by
season and locality rather emphasises the risk to the unborn of developing a congenital, yet
preventable brain disorder later in life.

Background
Microorganisms, including bacteria [1], are capable of
transferring part of their genome into mammalian germ
lines [2], and such exchange of foreign DNA has been suggested to be of mutual evolutionary advantage [3]. The
Lyme disease spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi, in particular,
disposes of a unique molecular mechanism of penetrating
into germ-line cells of its host, whose genes the intracellular pathogen exploits like a virus owing to its own incomplete genome [4]. Although countercurrent to established
views, the neurotropic spirochaete has integrated parts of
its genes into our germ line, these serving as putative tem-

plates for further recombination. If prenatal exposure to
such phylogenic traces of foreign DNA reoccurs during
ontogeny, a novel type of infectious mutation would occur within the 3' 'hotspot' for pathology of the human
cannabinoid receptor gene CB1 [5–7]. The genetic expression of CB1 [8] would subsequently be affected in exactly
those areas [9] that mirror the structural [10] and functional [11] brain abnormalities in schizophrenia.
Following the identification of neurosyphilis, caused by
the spirochaete Treponema pallidum, that led Kraepelin
[12] to recognise the distinctive pattern of dementia praePage 1 of 8

cox as a disease entity, Bleuler [13] coined the term 'schizophrenia'. Although this 'break' between reality and
'thought' is characterised by a multiplicity of signs and
symptoms, the highly prevalent illness is recognised
throughout the world, and there is now international
agreement on its classification. Apart from known infectious diseases, no other affliction exhibits an equally
marked seasonal distribution, thus nurturing the hope
that schizophrenia could ultimately be preventable.
Although Hippocrates (460 BC) recognised the importance of "the seasons of the year and the effects they produce ... being common to all countries as well as peculiar
to each locality", psychiatrists have been slow to accept
this idea. Systematic research into the season of psychiatric birth effects began only with the studies by Tramer [14]
and Lang [15] after the turn of the last century. Despite
methodological problems, including some cases of neurosyphilis within the ill-defined Swiss cohort, their findings could be widely replicated. Being born during winter
and spring is nowadays considered one of the most robust
epidemiological risk factors for sporadic schizophrenia.
The cause and exact timing of this birth excess, however,
has remained elusive so far [16].
Clinically, syphilis, which has long been associated with
devastating congenital outcomes, resembles Lyme disease. Like in humans [17], however, overt chronic infection of the unborn by Borrelia burgdorferi is rare in mice, as
placental transmission of this spirochaete is restricted to
an exclusively narrow time window at conception [18].
The present study is therefore focused on the seasonal distribution of schizophrenic birth excesses relative to Ixodes
tick activity worldwide – with a time lag expected to be
nine months apart. Otherwise, the hypothesis of B. burgdorferi being a major aetiological factor for congenital sporadic schizophrenia would be falsified.

Methods
For statistical reasons, only publications encompassing
more than 3000 cases of schizophrenic birth excesses
compared to the normal population have been considered [16]. These include two studies from Denmark and
Australia showing both one significant and one non-significant result each, whereas the birth excesses of the remaining studies were all statistically significant. From the
comprehensive literature, significant numerical data allowing for seasonal comparison were then used in this
meta analysis and plotted against the published data of B.
burgdorferi transmitting Ixodes tick activity (or numbers per
area) of the respective macroclimatic regions.

Results
Nine months' interval between tick activity and schizophrenic birth excesses
In the USA, Ixodes scapularis ticks exhibit a clearly defined
periodicity, increasing their numbers under specific macroclimatic conditions from March to April, in June and
October [19]. The seasonal distribution parallels the birth
excess for schizophrenia nine months later [20], while the
risk of developing schizophrenia is reduced towards a global decline in November. It is to be noted that the deficit
of schizophrenic births in late autumn occurs throughout
the world and correlates with the lowest number and activity of Ixodes ticks in wintertime nine months earlier.

As in Europe, the spring peak of tick activity in the USA
with a first climax in March [19] correlates with the rising
numbers of schizophrenic births between December and
January. In the Far East, the unimodal peak of Ixodes persulcatus from April to July [21] reflects the unimodal winter-spring birth excess in Japan followed by a relative
decline of schizophrenia in May [22].
Macroclimatic parameters
The distribution of schizophrenic births across Europe
[14,15,23,24], by contrast, mirrors the more complex seasonal concentration of tick populations, separated by a
midsummer decrease in humidity [19]. In Ireland, where
the maritime climatic conditions remain relatively mild
throughout the year, nymphal activity continues into
midsummer followed by a smaller peak in early autumn.
Although this bimodal pattern remains evident, it resembles the moderating environmental effects on the life cycle
of the tick Dermatocentor variabilis[19]. When the adult
ticks emerge from nymphs fed in the same year, they tend
to surge towards a midsummer peak from early May to
August, overlapping with the older cohort of adult ticks in
autumn [19]. In Ireland, this fusion into a more uniform
pattern of midsummer Ixodes ricinus activity [19] might
therefore account for the somewhat delayed, but pronounced schizophrenic birth excess in spring [23].

While in central Europe a few autumn-feeding I. ricinus
ticks are active up to October [19], the temperature falls
below zero in Finland. Like in the Alps, the minimal mean
temperature of seven degrees required for tick activity [19]
allows only one summer peak in northern Europe, including the Karelian border between Russia and Finland [21].
The seasonal periodicity of I. ricinus, in turn, reflects the
typical unimodal schizophrenic birth excess in Finland
[24] and Denmark [25]. The harsh weather conditions in
the north might furthermore reflect the stochastic fluctuations [26] of ticks in Scandinavia [27] and possibly schizophrenic births in Finland [28].

Figure 1
Seasonal correlation of sporadic schizophrenia to Ixodes ticks The seasonal periodicity of the adult and juvenile stages
of Ixodes scapularis in the State of New York [19] exactly mirrors the dynamics of schizophrenic births in the north-eastern
United States [20]. The spring and autumn populations of Ixodes ricinus in central Europe are affected by microclimatic conditions and a drop in humidity in midsummer (a = exposed meadow, b = dense hill vegetation or secondary deciduous woodland,
c = highly sheltered habitat, d = spring-derived but autumn-feeding cohort). In northern Europe, however, there exists no late
autumn cohort (d) as tick activity comes to a halt due to falling ambient temperature. Data adapted from [14,15,19,23,24]. The
seasonal distribution of Ixodes persulcatus ticks in the Far East [21] appears to have given rise to schizophrenic births between
February and March along with the typical decline in summer and late autumn [22]. In the case of a prenatal infection at the
time of conception, nine months later these variables run parallel to the birth excess number of individuals with schizophrenia.
In Singapore, by contrast, the non-significant birth excess in schizophrenia [41] is in line with the apparent absence of Ixodes
ticks and B. burgdorferi from that part of the world [40].

Due to the central European midsummer decrease in air
humidity and thus reduced tick activity [19], the relative
decline towards a schizophrenic birth deficit in April appears earlier and more pronounced the further south we
move. See Switzerland [14] and Germany [15] in figure 1.
Epidemiological gradients
That exposure precedes infection is self-evident. Like other
environmental causes, however, this relation is also expected to show a correlated biological gradient [29]. In
maritime Ireland and the sheltered microclimatic environment at the foot of the Swiss Alps, for example, tick
abundance and the transmission of three pathogenic species of B. burdorferi sensu lato[19,30,31] coincide with the
highest rates of schizophrenic births worldwide (see figure
1). Lower tick concentrations and infection rates by B.
burgdorferi sensu stricto[32] appear to score relatively lower
rates of schizophrenic birth excesses in the United States
[16]. Within the USA (see figure 2), however, the Pacific
Coast, New England and Great Lakes states score an approximately three times higher rate of schizophrenia compared to other states [33]. Schizophrenic birth excesses, in
particular, are more pronounced in New England and the
Midwest than in the South [20]. This trend, which has
been remarkably consistent over a long period, correlates
with the highest risk of Lyme disease and the largest populations of Ixodes ticks in the USA [34–37] (see figure 2).

Contrary to current belief [38], neither the incidence nor
the winter-spring birth excess of schizophrenia occurs at a
constant, global rate. The risk of schizophrenia [16] actually reflects the uneven distribution of B. burgdorferi endemicity worldwide [19]. South of the Wallace Line, which
limits the spread of Ixodes ticks by mammals into New
Guinea and Australia [19], seasonal schizophrenic trends
are less significant compared to the northern hemisphere
[39]. In Singapore, which is still a non-endemic area for
Ixodes ticks and B. burgdorferi[40], there is no significant
schizophrenic birth excess [41].

Discussion
One of the greatest triumphs of epidemiology stems from
the control of cholera before the responsible organism, let
alone its mechanism of action, had been identified. Major
progress in prevention is thus possible by focusing on
those variables that are known and can be influenced. Although the concept of cause is the source of much controversy, as it is in other sciences, a correct temporal relation
between exposure and effect is essential in epidemiology
[29].
Migratory birds
Like in other parts of the southern hemisphere [42], polar
birds travelling from the northern hemisphere sporadically via the Antarctic introduce Ixodes uriae ticks harbouring

http://www.ij-healthgeographics.com/content/1/1/2

Borrelia garinii into Australia. These, in turn, may infect
people in New South Wales [43] and adjacent coastal areas. However, B. burgdorferi could neither be detected in
[44], nor experimentally be transmitted by [45] the endemic species Ixodes holocyclus. Such maladaptation to local tick vectors might account for the low incidence of
borreliosis and thus the reportedly lower rate of schizophrenia in New South Wales [46] and other parts of Austronesia [47].
In the remote interior of New Guinea, on an island which
is reportedly non-endemic for Lyme disease [48], schizophrenia appears to be almost non-existent [47]. In a neuropsychiatric survey comprising more than 10,000
Papuans from the Indonesian part of New Guinea [49],
we found only one overtly psychotic case that had recently
arrived from his home town Merauke on the western
coast. In the interior of Papua New Guinea, schizophrenic
prevalence is also much lower than expected [50]. Yet in
the western coastal districts, where migratory birds are
known to introduce ticks from New South Wales and
Queensland [see [34]], and where Rusa deer (Cervus timorensis) originally imported by the Dutch abound, the prevalence of schizophrenia is significantly higher [50].
Migratory sea birds are also known to introduce I. persulcatus and B. garinii from their origin on the Eurasian mainland into pockets of northern Japan [51,52]. As in
Australia, however, the risk of acquiring Lyme disease is
relatively low, since the spirochaetes have not yet fully
adapted to the local Ixodes ovatus ticks. In contrast to I. persulcatus, this endemic tick species found all over Japan is
only capable of acquiring but not transmitting B. garinii to
its human hosts [53]. From that perspective, the relatively
recent introduction of B. garinii might possibly explain
the recent rise of schizophrenic birth excesses in Tokyo after the turn of the last century [22].
Deer and hedgehogs
Residential development favours small tree-enclosed
meadows interspersed with strips of woodland, much
prized by deer, hedgehogs, mice and cats. The widely reported correlation of schizophrenic birth excesses to more
densely populated urban and suburban areas [16] might
thus reflect the activity of ticks, now attacking people in
metropolitan areas [32]. At first sight this phenomenon
might appear counterintuitive. Yet, while deer play a crucial role in the development and recent geographical dispersal of adult ticks [32,35,54], their spirochaetocidal
antibodies exert a protective effect by clearing the borrelia
from the questing ticks' endolymph. Thereby the ticks lose
their infectious potential for human beings living in the
countryside [55]. This so-called zooprophylactic effect
particularly applies to the southern United States, where
ticks feed abundantly on lizards and skinks which poorly

maintain B. burgdorferi infection [37]. Compared to
southern states such as Mississippi, where lizards are endemic, by contrast Michigan poses a relatively higher risk
for Lyme disease despite the relative scarcity of ticks in
that state.
Due to the continuous peridomestic parcellation of nature, hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) also abound as excellent hosts for Ixodes nymphs as well as the particularly
dangerous adult Ixodes ticks (personal observation). What
is worse, their apparent lack of zooprophylaxis contributes to the periurban transmission of borreliosis [56] in
our gardens.
Mice and cats
In peridomestic sites, various mice, Peromyscus leucopus in
eastern North America and Apodemus agrarius in Europe,
are the most important reservoirs of B. burgdorferi infection [30,32]. As cats go for these mice, they reportedly
spread Ixodes nymphs near or in households (see [34]].
Not surprisingly, therefore, there is significantly more often a cat in the household at the time of birth of an individual who later develops schizophrenia [57].
Biological plausibility of cause and effect
The nine months' interval between tick activity and schizophrenic birth excesses implies an infection at conception
or shortly afterwards. It is tempting to speculate that a mutagenic interaction between the implanting blastocyst and
pathogen depends on the simultaneous epigenetic exposure of both embryonic and microbial DNA reading
frames [58] – weeks before neurons differentiate and embryonic brain development sets in. As ontogeny reflects
phylogeny, the fast-switching ionotropic neuroreceptors
dominate in the adult mammalian brain, whereas earlier
in life and evolution the slow metabotropic neuroreceptors appear during implantation as critical elements in
intercellular signalling before neurons differentiate [59].
There exists only one metabotropic neuroreceptor gene
implicated in both schizophrenia [8,60,61] and embryonic implantation [62]: the CB1 cannabinoid receptor gene.
Likewise, within human CB1, the phylogenic trace of a
microbial virulence factor, the flagellar basal rod protein
originating from B. burgdorferi[5], cannot be entirely coincidental, since this foreign DNA codes for spirochaetal intrusion into foreign tissue as well.

For successful implantation into foreign tissue, and in order to suppress HLA mediated antigen presentation to maternal tissue [63], the implanting embryo secretes
interferon gamma [64]. Worse still, interferon gamma
also up-regulates the molecular machinery of genetic recombination and variation by B. burgdorferi[65]. Through
this cytokine mediated mutagenesis, the co-expression
and genetic exposure of both embryonic and spirochaetal

Figure 2
Geographical correlation of schizophrenia to Ixodes
ticks and Lyme disease in the USA The epidemiological
correlation between Ixodes ticks and schizophrenia originally
published by Brown [34] has been adjusted according to the
more recent epidemiological data on the risk of Lyme disease
including zooprophylaxis [35–37,55].

DNA coding for foreign intrusion has arguably led to the
germ-line mutations of our ancestral CB1. In the course of
evolution, exposure of complementary DNA templates
has furthermore led to genetic recombination with other
loci whose distribution is not entirely random. Rather, the
chromosomal scatter of the respective spirochaetal nucleotides presents surprising explanatory power for some
schizophrenic linkage and genetic coincidence studies
that have remained so far unaccounted for [6].
Lyme disease is easily missed in psychiatry [66–69]. The
case report of a 19 year-old patient suffering from neuroborreliosis is perhaps the most illuminating. He presented at the Department of Psychiatry in Munich
(Germany) with acute catatonic and paranoid symptoms
including negativism, stereotyped movements, delusional
ideas of persecution as well as acoustic hallucinations.
Upon isolation of B. burgdorferi from the CSF and the
demonstration of intrathecal IgG antibodies, the patient

completely recovered after antibiotic therapy [68]. However, this type of adult-onset, schizophrenia-like encephalitis – which closely resembles the cataleptic symptoms of
CB1 knockout mice [70] – is rather the exception to the
rule. In the United States, from where the highly neurotropic B. garinii is absent, a search for antibodies in schizophrenic patients has, compared to normal controls,
yielded negative results (Torrey, 2001; unpublished data).
In the Czech Republic, however, a subtle, yet significant
correlation between elevated antibody titers against B.
burgdorferi and schizophrenia has recently been demonstrated [71].
Prenatal infection restricted to parts of the fetal brain always results in a brain disorder, whose severity depends
on the proportion of neurons involved. Like neuroborreliosis, sporadic schizophrenia therefore appears to be
characterised by an excess of focal neurological damage
[72]. If the mutation also affects germ-line cells, initiating
familial schizophrenia in the offspring of the next generation (born at any season throughout the year), all neurons
will be affected. The phenotype of disordered integrative
functions is then expected to be more severe. In familial
schizophrenia, this is in fact the case [72]. Conversely, attempts to correlate the schizophrenic birth excess with its
symptomatology have yielded a negative family history
and, more specifically, a lesser severity of illness [16].

The contribution of genetic factors to the risk of developing schizophrenia has been demonstrated in family, twin
and adoption studies. The majority of patients, however,
do not marry or have children, and the magnitude is such
that any genetic predisposition would be eliminated from
the genetic pool within a few generations. But it is not, nor
do the majority of patients have a family history of the disease, and the 50% concordance rate in monozygotic twins
falls short of the 100% that would be expected from genetically identical individuals. The answer possibly lies
"in having above all a strong enough hypothesis that can
be tested with linkage data" [73], and in considering "that
epigenetic modification of the gene(s), rather than a crucial variation in DNA sequence, leads to illness." [74,75]

Conclusion

14.

At present, it cannot be excluded that sporadic prenatal infection by B. burgdorferi poses a psychiatric hazard to the
unborn. On the contrary; the epidemiological clustering
by season and locality, being characteristic of an acute
contagious disease [29], rather points to a causal relation
between global Ixodes tick endemicity and sporadic schizophrenia.
