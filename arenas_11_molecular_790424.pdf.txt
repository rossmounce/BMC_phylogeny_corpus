Abstract
Background: The TlyA protein has a controversial function as a virulence factor in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.
tuberculosis). At present, its dual activity as hemolysin and RNA methyltransferase in M. tuberculosis has been
indirectly proposed based on in vitro results. There is no evidence however for TlyA relevance in the survival of
tubercle bacilli inside host cells or whether both activities are functionally linked. A thorough analysis of structure
prediction for this mycobacterial protein in this study shows the need for reevaluating TlyA’s function in virulence.
Results: Bioinformatics analysis of TlyA identified a ribosomal protein binding domain (S4 domain), located
between residues 5 and 68 as well as an FtsJ-like methyltranferase domain encompassing residues 62 and 247, all
of which have been previously described in translation machinery-associated proteins. Subcellular localization
prediction showed that TlyA lacks a signal peptide and its hydrophobicity profile showed no evidence of
transmembrane helices. These findings suggested that it may not be attached to the membrane, which is
consistent with a cytoplasmic localization. Three-dimensional modeling of TlyA showed a consensus structure,
having a common core formed by a six-stranded b-sheet between two a-helix layers, which is consistent with an
RNA methyltransferase structure. Phylogenetic analyses showed high conservation of the tlyA gene among
Mycobacterium species. Additionally, the nucleotide substitution rates suggested purifying selection during tlyA
gene evolution and the absence of a common ancestor between TlyA proteins and bacterial pore-forming
proteins.
Conclusion: Altogether, our manual in silico curation suggested that TlyA is involved in ribosomal biogenesis and
that there is a functional annotation error regarding this protein family in several microbial and plant genomes,
including the M. tuberculosis genome.

Background
Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that mainly
afflicts populations in third-world countries. Although
most infected people will never develop an active form
of the disease, the global TB death rate is substantial,
being around two million people per year. The situation
has been further exacerbated by the emergence and
spread of extremely resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains (XDR) [1] which, together with the lack of
effective antibiotics, urges the development of new

alternatives for controlling this worldwide public health
threat. Consequently, most research efforts have focused
on understanding M. tuberculosis biology with the aim
of identifying new therapeutic and vaccine targets.
Current management of TB cases consists of a twomonth intensive treatment comprising first-line drugs
such as Rifampicin (RIF), Isoniazid (INH), Pyrazinamide
(PZA) and Ethambutol (EMB)/Streptomycin (SM) which
seeks to ensure that mono-resistant strains do not proliferate [2]. When RIF and INH are ineffective, standard
treatment guidelines recommend a combination of
second-line drugs [3]. Among these therapeutic choices,
aminoglycosides such as Capreomycin (CMN) and Viomycin (VMN) are given in combination with other

antibiotics to treat multidrug-resistant strains (MDR); they
are also effective against non-replicating M. tuberculosis
strains, as well as being useful in the treatment of latent
TB infections [4]. CMN- and VMN-resistant bacilli are
classified as XDR-TB strains and are a cause of major
concern since these drugs have more toxic side effects
and might result in higher death rates, especially among
HIV-infected persons [1].
Controversially, M. tuberculosis tlyA gene product has
been annotated both as a virulence factor, due to its
ability to lyse red blood cells, as well as a protein
involved in ribosome biogenesis [5,6].
TlyA has been assumed to induce hemolytic activity
due to its high amino acid similarity (37.3%) to the poreforming hemolysin/cytotoxin virulence determinant from
Serpulina hyodysenteriae. Notably such activity was only
experimentally demonstrated with bacterial lysates [6]
and another study has even suggested that TlyA could be
associated with hemolysin expression in Escherichia coli
[7,8]. Additionally, recent study showed that a concentration-dependent hemolysis of rabbit and human erythrocytes to be induced on incubation with the recombinant
Rv1694 protein (the putative M. tuberculosis TlyA) when
over-expressed in E. coli [8]. The article reported hemolysis inhibition using specific antiserum against the same
protein as well as the presence of the recombinant protein on E. coli cell wall; these data were supportive of
TlyA’s hemolytic property, combined with a preliminary
in silico analysis. Rv1694 oligomers were also observed
on lysed erythrocyte membranes, as well as the susceptibility of Rv1694-expressing E. coli to CMN [8]. Despite
such thorough in vitro analysis in E. coli, the functional
activities suggested for Rv1694 have still not been clearly
demonstrated when using M. tuberculosis mutant strains.
By contrast with the proposed hemolytic function,
Johansen et al., [5] have reported that M. tuberculosis
H37Rv and Beijing TlyA confer susceptibility to CMN
and VMN. These antibiotics are structurally similar and
share the same mechanism of action, both inhibiting bacterial proliferation by blocking the peptidyl transferase
reaction. VMN hinders A-site and P-site tRNA positioning on the 50S ribosomal subunit, therefore hampering
mRNA translation [9]. CMN resistance arises due to
mutations in the tlyA gene which encodes a RNA 2’-Omethyltransferase (2’-O-MTase) that methylates ribose
moieties from nucleotide C1409 in 16S rRNA and C1920
in 23S rRNA. The absence of these rRNA methylations
confers resistance against CMN and VMN given that
binding sites for these antibiotics are delineated by the
localization of such methylated riboses [5]. Additional
evidence has been provided by mutant complementation,
showing that CMN susceptibility is restored by introducing an active copy of the tlyA gene [10]. TlyA methylation clearly enhances CMN and VMN susceptibility and

is responsible, at least in part, for their efficacy against
mycobacterial infections as drug binding is impaired
when the enzyme is not produced. Resistance thus
emerges when TlyA activity is lost. These studies show
the need for a reevaluation of TlyA’s function in
virulence [5,11].

Results
TlyA related sequences

The BLAST search for TlyA-related sequences in the TB
and Genbank databases showed that although TlyArelated sequences are found mainly in prokaryotic organisms, homologous protein sequences are also present in
eukaryotic organisms such as plants and algae (Figure 1A).
These M. tuberculosis-related TlyA protein sequences
are mainly classified as hemolysin A inside the FtsJ-like
class based on domain similarity and have been annotated as such in Genbank, EMBL, UniProt and SWISSPROT databases according to sequence similarity with
Serpulina hyodysenteriae TlyA annotated as being a
hemolysin. Paradoxically, although hemolysin A contains
similar domain architecture to TlyA, it is predicted to be
a rRNA methylase instead of a contact-dependent
hemolysin (Table S1, Additional file 1).
TlyA amino acid sequences from M. tuberculosis H37Rv,
H37Ra, CDC1551, M. bovis and M. bovis-BCG reference
strain alignment showed a 100% identity with the Harleem, F11 and C M. tuberculosis strains (Figure 1B). The
same conservation pattern was obtained when the corresponding nucleotide sequences were aligned (> 99%
identity).
Similarity percentages found in the multiple amino
acid alignment of Mycobacterium species different to
M. tuberculosis, such as M. smegmatis (76%), M. abscessus
(72%), M. leprae (78%), M. avium (79-80%) and
M. vanbaalenii PYR-1 (76%), showed high TlyA conservation at genus level. A glutamine residue insertion was
found at position 269 in the protein’s C-terminal region in
all the aforementioned species, while a 12-residue insertion
was found only in M. ulcerans (81%) and M. marinum
(81%), which are pathogenic mycobacteria (Figure 1B).
TlyA transcriptional unit revealed some rearrangements
in the Mycobacterium IprJ-recN operon

From the synteny of the IprJ-recN operon from
M. tuberculosis, M. bovis BCG, M. bovis, M. leprae,
M. ulcerans and M. marinum (Figure 2) it was evident
that almost all gene products, except for tlyA, are involved
in intermediary metabolism, cell wall biosynthesis and
signal transduction rather than virulence. Moreover, no
trafficking proteins were found within the operon
or near tlyA that could be suggestive of TlyA transportation either to the cell membrane or the extracellular
milieu.

The IprJ-recN operon also had common gene organization in M. tuberculosis and M. bovis, while in
M. leprae most genes have lost their function (i.e. have
become pseudogenes). Such high rate of loss of function
in genes involved in intermediary metabolism, cellular
respiration and cell-wall biosynthesis may suggest that
the loss of such genes confers an adaptive advantage on

Mycobacterium during host cell infection or transmission [12]. No other genes reported to be involved in
bacilli virulence were found within this operon.

A, at 1.53 Å resolution) was used as template for
homology modeling. The obtained identity (37.2%,
RMSD 0.44 Å, E-value 4.7e-26) suggested that the
selected hemolysin structure was a suitable template for
TlyA, and that the obtained modeled structure could
reflect an experimentally-obtained M. tuberculosis TlyA
structure.
Although this protein seemed to be a hemolysin, its
domain architecture was also similar to RNA methyltransferase family, fibrillarin homologues and TlyA proteins. A consensus sequence was established which
showed the presence of a common core, comprising six
b-sheets, the first five of which were found parallel and
the sixth anti-parallel between two layers of a-helices
and random coiled regions. Such structural organization
is commonly referred as to an AdoMet-dependent
methyltransferase (MTase) fold [13,14].

TlyA has an overall globular fold and comprises two
domains exhibiting different spatial arrangements. The
smaller domain, named S4, is N-terminally located and
is overlapped by the catalytic domain which exhibits
structural similarity to various unrelated RNA-binding
proteins, while the large catalytic domain, named FtsJlike methyltransferase domain is common to 2’-OMTases and exhibits a a/b fold with a deep pocket
(Figure 3).
The S4 domain consists of 64 residues, starting at A-5
and ending at H-68. This domain is structurally formed
by one b-sheet and three a-helices predominantly composed of positively charged residues (11 out of 47 residues) whose probable function is to mediate RNA
binding and provide stability. In line with this, the RNABindR server identified three short sequences (1-MARRAR-6, 13-RRGLARSRQQ-22 and 31-KVR-33) inside

the S4 domain that might be implicated in RNA binding
(Figure 3). The S4 domain has been specifically identified in some bacterial and eukaryotic ribosomal proteins,
pseudouridine synthases, RNA methylases, bacterial
tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases and may also be involved in
translation regulation [15].
The analysis of the protein’s electrostatic surface
showed that positively charged residues were localized
towards the N-terminal extreme, forming bulges and
long finger-like projections that probably extend into
the rRNA core to stabilize its structure (Figure 4). In
fact, charged residues like R and K exhibited the highest
interface propensities, which is consistent with their
ability to participate in interactions both with nucleotide
bases and the negatively charged RNA phosphate
backbone [16].
The FtsJ-like methyltransferase domain is located
between residues 62 and 247 and includes the catalytic
tetrad responsible for TlyA’s enzymatic activity [14].
Moreover, the FtsJ-like methyltransferase domain exhibits a Rossmann fold composed of five parallel b-strand
layers linked by two a-helices following an a/b secondary structure topological order [17].
Our comparative analysis of TlyA with the Fibrillarin
family showed the presence of a GASTG AdoMet binding
motif comprising residues 90-94 and a D located at position 112 juxtaposed to the above mentioned motif (Figure
3A), which might stabilize TlyA coenzyme binding [13].
AdoMet was located between b-strands 4 and 5 within the
inner depression inside the catalytic pocket formed by
GASTG residues’ main-chain NH groups (Figure 3B).
Moreover, substrate positioning might be driven by the
Rossmann configuration fold and the pertinent AdoMetbinding/catalytic sites, suggesting substrate selectivity in
the small ribosomal subunit [17]. Likewise, domain

structure was in agreement with S-adenosyl-methionine
(AdoMet)-dependent methyltransferases. AdoMet binding
and affinity might indicate how an enzyme such as TlyA
may methylate the two adjacent ribose rings on both ribosomal subunits. In this reaction S-adenosyl-methionine
(SAM) acts as methyl donor, as it is converted into S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH); TlyA could thus be also classified as being an RNA-AdoMet-MTase class I [18].
This hypothesis is supported by the high structural
similarity (98.1%) between TlyA and FtsJ RNA-MTase
complexed with AdoMet (ligand-binding template PDB
entry 1EJ0) (RMSD 2.98, Similarity score: 368.77 Evalue: 1.30E-06) (Figure S1, Additional file 2). Two
expected structural motifs were also identified in this
structure which was formed by six buried residues
between G-90 and F-96 which are pivotal for AdoMet
interaction and therefore conserved in Mycobacterium
TlyA proteins (Table 1).
The TlyA model was validated by using the RAMPAGE server which evaluates a protein’s 3D-structure
based on the stereochemistry quality of torsion angles
and geometry [19]. The Ramachandran plot showed
95.1% feasibility (253 aa) in favorable positions and
3.8% (10 residues) in acceptable regions, with just
1.1% in an outlier region (3 residues), supporting the
high quality of the 3D-model (Figure S2, Additional
file 3).
This in silico structure analysis of M. tuberculosis proteins allowed a deeper understanding of TlyA’s function
and challenges the initially described function of TlyArelated proteins. Rather than its hypothetical function as
a hemolysin, our data suggested functions as an MTase
based on in silico prediction.
Predicting subcellular localization

Subcellular localization was predicted with TBpred
[http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/tbpred/] and the
results suggested TlyA localization in the cytoplasmatic
compartment (Table 2), also supporting the fact that
TlyA acts as a methyltransferase [5]. A recent mycobacterial protein analysis led to ascertaining several predictors’ reliability for subcellular localization, providing
highly accurate results for Gpos-PLoc and PA-SUB v.2.5
and SignalP 2.0 as a confirmatory tool [20]. However, in
this study, PA-SUB v.2.5 predicted TlyA as being an
extracellular protein (72.84%), which could have been
biased as the training strategy used involved results
from the SWISS-PROT [21] database where TlyA is
mis-annotated. Likewise, in agreement with BLAST
scores for the query sequence (Rv1694), 26 out of 28
homologous proteins were designated as putative ribosomal RNA methyltransferases and RNA binding proteins.
Only one submitted sequence seemed to be similar to
hemolysin A (the S. hyodysenteriae sequence).

Nest analysis of two structural motifs detected in TlyA functionally important regions for AdoMet binding region. Results were obtained on Profunc server [43].

Evolutionary insights into tlyA genes

Evolutionary analysis of tlyA genes from 16 mycobacterial species, 8 species taxonomically related to Mycobacterium, 4 Adomet-RNA MTases and 7 PFP showed
similar topology by both Neighbor-joining (NJ) and
Maximum Parsimony (MP) methods, suggesting that the
phylogenetic relationship observed was highly reliable
(Figure 5).
The consensus tree showed the tlyA gene in M. tuberculosis H37Rv, CDC1551, C, Haarlem, Beijing, KZN and
INH-RIF strains as well as in the M. bovis AF2122 and
BCG strains to fit in a monophyletic cluster. The tlyA
tree exhibited short genetic distances (less than 1%) for
M. tuberculosis complex species, including those separated according to clinical considerations.
Phylogenetic analysis showed that Mycobacterium tlyA
genes are closely related to those of Nocardia and Rhodococcus genus; such branching patterns were supported
by high bootstrap values and agreed with the results
obtained from 16S rDNA phylogeny. No differences
were observed between antibiotic susceptible and resistant M. tuberculosis strains. Mycobacterium TlyA proteins fell into 4 groups; each group formed a welldelineated branch supported by high bootstrap values.

M. abscessus was the most distant and TlyA-ancestral
species from the Mycobacterium genus compared to
the closest species to M. tuberculosis (M. ulcerans,
M. marinum and M. leprae). Serpulina hyodysenteriae
and Lawsonia intracellularis LsaA antigen sequences
were included due to their sequence identity to
M. tuberculosis TlyA (26.5%), sharing a common ancestor, although having experimentally-attributed different
roles [6,22-24] (Figure 5).
Pattern branching of the phylogenetic tree showed that
the TlyA protein formed a monophyletic cluster with
AdoMet RNA MTases, suggesting a common evolutionary origin; these findings might also imply a similar functional role in translational machinery. PFP formed a
distant cluster where diverse proteins were clustered on a
branch with the most divergent proteins (Figure 5).
The synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions
were calculated to identify the action of neutral, positive
or purifying selection on tlyA genes; their synonymous,
Pi(a), and non-synonymous diversity, Pi(s), was 0.672
and 0.132, respectively, corresponding to a 0.196 Pi(a)/Pi
(s) rate which can be inferred as purifying selection acting on this gene among Mycobacterium species. This
suggests that conservation at sequence level might show

Discussion
The aim of the present study was to describe structural
and phylogenetic features of M. tuberculosis TlyA, using
bioinformatics tools. The structural and phylogenetic
analysis shown here highlights the need for re-annotating this protein family and redefining it as an RNA-

binding FtsJ-like methyltransferase in bioinformatics
databases; this is based on the high degree of amino
acid sequence similarity found in the Mycobacterium
species analyzed here. It can be surmised that physical
organization, domain spatial arrangement and protein
folding on TlyA is structurally conserved.
Previous sequence analysis of 2’-O-MTase families has
indicated that they use a similar catalytic mechanism
and have inherited a common function from the same
ancestral ribose 2’-O-MTase. Feder et al., suggested that

Arenas et al. BMC Structural Biology 2011, 11:16
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/11/16

TlyA is a 2’-O-MTase, identifying a catalytic tetrad consisting of lysine-69, aspartic acid-154, lysine-182 and
glutamic acid in position 238 (K69-D154-K182-E238)
[14]. Based on amino acid sequence alignment, our
comparative analysis with the RrmJ family and other
related RNA 2’-O-MTases [13,14,18] showed changes in
D154-K182-E238 residue positions (Figure 1). However,
despite being located in different sequence positions, the
scaffold formed by these residues was maintained at the
catalytic site in the modeled protein 3D structure without affecting protein function [25].
Despite the diversity of existing MTases, the majority
maintain the same catalytic mechanism where K-182
binds to a hydrogen from the ribose 2-OH’ group; this
nucleophilic attack generates a transition state (SN2-like
state). The lysine side chain shifts E-238 so that its
negatively charged carboxyl group becomes available to
promote the attack of the methyl donor [18]; furthermore, this conserved amino acid residue pattern was
also observed in our evolutionary trace analysis.
TlyA three-dimensional structure resembled an RNA
methyltransferase

The S. hyodysenteriae TlyA postulated mechanism for
hemolysin action is said to be similar to that for poreforming protein (PFP) mechanisms [6]; TlyA folding,
however, is inconsistent with PFPs due its lack of membrane-binding domains, cholesterol-recognition and
insertion motifs, and other characteristic features such
as a conserved undecapeptide (ECTGLAWEWWR) near
the C- or N- terminal ends. It also lacks repeat domains
in the toxin (RTX) and calcium-binding glycine-rich
motifs necessary for oligomerization [26]. This in silico
structure analysis of M. tuberculosis proteins led to a
deeper understanding of TlyA’s role and challenged the
initially described function for TlyA-related proteins.
A combination of bioinformatics analysis and experimental structure elucidation may suggest alternative
functional roles for previously-annotated enzymes, as
with (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase, phosphatase
and N-acetyltransferase structures from M. tuberculosis
[11,27,28]. Theoretical evidence has thus been provided
for TlyA’s role in RNA modification instead of it just
being a hemolytic factor.
Subcellular localization suggested a cytoplasmatic
localization consistent with ribosome-associated activity

Predicting subcellular localization is important since
several characteristics can be deduced, such as protein
function and genome annotation. It also aids experimental design for proteomics platforms, particularly for
identifying new candidates for vaccine development and
drug targets [29,30]. Protein sequence analysis did not
reveal a signal peptide, suggesting that TlyA is not

Page 8 of 11

secreted; however, some authors have described TlyA as
being a probable PFP [6], supported by the presence of
over-expressed TlyA on the E. coli wall surface [8].
TlyA lacks transmembrane helices and b-barrels
(2.877 value), suggesting that this protein might not be
a membrane-embedded or contact-dependent hemolysin, as has previously been proposed [6,23]. TlyA also
has a hydrophobic region in the C-terminal domain
(residues 115-133) which may not form a membranespanning a-helix. Nonetheless, such a region might
allow the adenine present in AdoMet to fit properly
inside the catalytic pocket, thus suggesting a different
role for these hydrophobic residues. Virulence-related
functional annotation, based on all the above-mentioned
data, remains controversial.
Conservation of tlyA genes and functions was
expected according to our phylogenetic and evolutionary
trace analyses, the initial hypothesis being that homologous proteins have related functions. However, the
extent to which this is true has not been assessed in
detail up to now; annotation based on protein homology
might thus lead to finding unexpected variations in
function.

Conclusions
The main concern of our work was to decipher structural information about the TlyA family by homology
comparison. Our structural analysis and finding residue
conservation within the active site supports recent
experimental work [8] about TlyA’s role as RNA 2`-OMTase in M. tuberculosis. This is further supported by
the domain composition also suggesting methyltransferase activity and RNA-binding. The distribution of
charged residues also defines a likely RNA interaction
instead of hemolytic activity, little similarity being exhibited with hemolysin proteins, perhaps representing inaccurate annotations in several databases, as observed with
other protein families [31].
Since genome annotation is based on sequence comparison, it is the most commonly used approach for
determining functional homology. Annotations are
assigned if proteins surpass similarity cut-off and the
propagation of original errors could be increased by
each new entry. In such cases, protein function needs to
be inferred from their common three-dimensional structures and manual curation.
Methods
Search for TlyA related sequences

Sequences homologous to M. tuberculosis TlyA (Rv1694;
GenBank: CAA66941) in other Mycobacterium spp. were
found by screening the TB-Database [http://www.tbdb.
org/]. Protein and gene sequence similarity was analyzed
by BLAST tools [32] for searching the NCBI non-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/11/16

redundant sequence database [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/] and a homology comparison was made using
BLASTp for the PDB database. The TlyA-like sequences
so obtained were aligned using the CLUSTALW Multiple
Sequence Alignment program [http://align.genome.jp/]
[33] and manually edited in BIOEDIT [34]. The alignment
was visualized using the CLC sequence alignment viewer
v6.0 [http://www.clcbio.com] [32] to obtain similarity
scores for each amino acid position. The M. tuberculosis
IprJ-recN operon genes (IprJ, Rv1691, Rv1692, Rv1693,
tlyA, ppnK and recN), where tlyA gene is located, were all
searched within the M bovis, M bovis BCG, M. leprae,
M. ulcerans and M. marinum genome databases for visual
examination of the transcriptional unit.

sequence. TlyA’s subcellular localization was predicted
using the TBpred server [29], a specific tool for mycobacterial proteins. Results were compared to subcellular
localization predictions obtained from Gpos-PLoc [30],
PSORTb v2.0.4 [45], PA-SUB [46], CELLO v2.5 [47],
LOCtree [48], SubLoc v1.0 [21], MemType-2L [49] and
TMBETA-SVM [50]. The position of RNA binding residues was predicted using the RNAbind server [51].
b-barrel structures were predicted with PRED-TMBB
[http://biophysics.biol.uoa.gr/PRED-TMBB/input.jsp]
using a 2.965 threshold value [52].
Phylogenetic and evolutionary trace analysis

This protein’s domain composition was analyzed using
the SMART-Simple Modular Architecture Research
Tool [http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de] [35] in combination with the Pfam database [http://www.sanger.ac.uk/
Software/Pfam/] [36].
An M. tuberculosis TlyA (Rv1694) secondary structure
consensus was built based on the predictions obtained
with SAM [37], PSIPRED [38] and JNet secondary structure prediction [39] servers. This consensus allowed
poorly and highly structured regions to be compared for
selecting the best tridimensional (3D) structure model
according to structural homology and folding prediction.

The molecular phylogenetic tree for TlyA was built with
Neighbor Joining (NJ), using p-distance as substitution
model, and Maximum Parsimony (MP) methods in
MEGA Version 4.0, with 5,000 iterations for calculating
bootstrap confidence levels [53]. Phylogenetic tree construction included the sequences for Mycobacterium
TlyA proteins and/or putative cytotoxin/hemolysins
reported in the TB-database for the following 11 mycobacterial species, including 14 different strains. Pertinent
sequences were found in 21 M. tuberculosis-related species (Table S1, Additional file 1).
Evolutionary Trace Report Maker [54] and Evolutionary Trace Analysis [55] and DnaSP [56] were used for
identifying residues under evolutionary pressure and
substitution rates were determined using MEGA 4.0.

Protein 3D-structure prediction

Additional material

Fold-recognition and domain analysis

An M. tuberculosis TlyA structural model was obtained
from its amino acid sequence by using SWISS MODEL
[http://swissmodel.expasy.org/] [40] and Protein Homology/analogY Recognition Engine (PHYRE) [http://www.
sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre/] prediction servers [32,41]; the
obtained models were classified according to identity
percentages. Both, protein structure and function models (3HP7, 1QD7, 1Q8K, 3DOU, 2PLW, 1FJG, 1EJ0 PDB
entries) were compared to the secondary consensus
sequence obtained as described above. Structure refinement and minimization were carried out using UCSF
CHIMERA program [42], and the resulting 3D-model
was submitted to ProFunc server [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
thornton-srv/databases/profunc/] [19,32,43] to predict
biochemical functions and structural motifs. The
obtained 3D-model was stereo-chemically evaluated on
RAMPAGE server [19] which provides a score based on
proline and glycine preferential positions according to a
Ramachandran plot.
Subcellular localization prediction

The Phobius server [44] was used to predict the presence of the signal peptide and transmembrane
a-helices within the M. tuberculosis TlyA amino acid
