Abstract
Background: Microsatellite loci are frequently used in genomic studies of DNA sequence repeats
and in population studies of genetic variability. To investigate the effect of sequence properties of
microsatellites on their level of variability we have analyzed genotypes at 627 microsatellite loci in
1,048 worldwide individuals from the HGDP-CEPH cell line panel together with the DNA
sequences of these microsatellites in the human RefSeq database.
Results: Calibrating PCR fragment lengths in individual genotypes by using the RefSeq sequence
enabled us to infer repeat number in the HGDP-CEPH dataset and to calculate the mean number
of repeats (as opposed to the mean PCR fragment length), under the assumption that differences
in PCR fragment length reflect differences in the numbers of repeats in the embedded repeat
sequences. We find the mean and maximum numbers of repeats across individuals to be positively
correlated with heterozygosity. The size and composition of the repeat unit of a microsatellite are
also important factors in predicting heterozygosity, with tetra-nucleotide repeat units high in G/C
content leading to higher heterozygosity. Finally, we find that microsatellites containing more
separate sets of repeated motifs generally have higher heterozygosity.
Conclusions: These results suggest that sequence properties of microsatellites have a significant
impact in determining the features of human microsatellite variability.

Background
Microsatellite loci consist of short tandem repeats (STR)
that vary in length between individuals and that generally
have many distinct alleles within a population. The high
level of variability for microsatellites compared to other
genomic regions [1-4] and their abundance in diverse
genomes [5-9] have led to their use as markers in many
settings, including linkage analysis [10-14], forensic

investigations [15-21], human population genetics [2227], and phylogeny reconstruction [28-30].
Microsatellites are among the fastest-evolving DNA
sequences, with relatively high mutation rates of at least
10-6-10-3 events per locus per gamete per generation, as
measured in humans [2,31-36], other mammals [37-39],
plants [40-42], and various other organisms [43-47]. It is

this high mutation rate that has been a key factor in determining the informativeness of microsatellites in genetic
studies. They have been used extensively over the last 1015 years to investigate genetic variation across populations in many species [22,48-63].
The sequence properties of microsatellites have also been
studied in a variety of organisms. Database analyses of
genomic sequences have investigated the genome-wide
frequency and distribution of microsatellites; such analyses find that the frequencies of microsatellites with different repeat motifs, as well as their average and maximum
repeat lengths, vary widely both between and within
motif size classes (di-, tri-, tetra-, or penta-nucleotide)
[7,8,64-68]. Many microsatellites consist of uninterrupted, or "perfect", sets of consecutive repeats. However,
a microsatellite can also be comprised of adjacent tandem
arrays of different repeat motifs (termed "compound"
[69]) or "interrupted" as a result of point mutations and
small insertions or deletions that have occurred during
the evolution of the locus (also termed "imperfect").
Whereas sequence studies of microsatellites rely on complete or partial genome sequences, typical microsatellite
studies of genetic diversity instead use data sets of
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragment lengths measured for microsatellite loci in a collection of individuals.
Each fragment length is obtained using locus-specific
DNA primer pairs to amplify the specific region of the
genome containing a particular microsatellite. A PCR fragment length represents the size of the region between the
distal ends of a DNA primer pair, with changes in the
number of repeats of the microsatellite embedded
between the primer pair leading to corresponding changes
in PCR fragment length. Thus, differences in fragment
length are used as a proxy for differences in the number of
repeats. However, DNA primer pairs are placed to optimize their PCR amplification efficiency rather than to satisfy specific distance criteria, and the distances of primers
from the embedded repeat sequence vary greatly between
loci. Differences in PCR fragment lengths are therefore
representative of differences in repeat number for genotypes of a given microsatellite locus, but they do not allow
absolute numbers of repeats to be determined. The
lengths of PCR fragments also do not provide information
about other underlying sequence properties, such as base
composition of repeat motifs, interruptions, and adjacency of separate tandem arrays.
In this study we aim to link diversity in human populations with underlying sequence properties for 627 microsatellite loci. Using the human RefSeq sequence for each
locus, we investigate the effects of intrinsic genomic properties of microsatellites - namely the size and sequence of
their repeat units, the number of separate STR regions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/612

embedded in their sequences and the distance separating
such regions if more than one of them is found, and the
properties of the sequences flanking the STR regions - on
features of their genetic diversity in a worldwide sample of
1,048 individuals. Assuming that differences in PCR fragment length reflect differences in the numbers of repeats
in the embedded STRs, we use the human RefSeq
sequence to calibrate PCR fragment lengths in individual
genotypes for inferring repeat numbers for the 627 microsatellite loci in the worldwide data set. This calibration
enables us to investigate the effect of the mean, minimum,
and maximum of the number of repeats across individuals on statistics measuring genetic diversity. Two previous
reports on microsatellite loci in Drosophila melanogaster
found heterozygosity to be positively correlated with the
mean [70] and maximum [70,71] number of repeats;
however, two other reports, also in D. melanogaster, did
not find statistically significant correlations [72,73]. To
the best of our knowledge, in humans, because of the limitations of PCR-based genotyping, the relationship of
sequence properties of human microsatellites and properties of microsatellite genetic diversity has yet to be
explored in detail.

Methods
Microsatellite genotype data
The data set that we analyzed consisted of 1,048 individuals from the HGDP-CEPH Human Genome Diversity
Cell Line Panel [74] genotyped for 783 microsatellites
spread across all 22 autosomes. These 783 microsatellites
were comprised of the 377 loci from Marshfield Screening
Set no. 10 that were previously reported by Rosenberg et
al. [26], as well as the 406 additional loci from Marshfield
Screening Sets no. 13 and 52 that were previously
reported by Ramachandran et al. [75] and Rosenberg et al.
[76]. For each microsatellite locus the genotype data consisted of PCR fragment lengths in each individual,
obtained using locus-specific DNA primer pairs to amplify
the specific region of the genome containing that microsatellite.
Microsatellite primer sequences
Primer pairs for all 783 microsatellites were obtained
from the publicly available primer sequence file provided
by the Mammalian Genotyping Service [77] (Marshfield,
WI)
http://research.marshfieldclinic.org/genetics/
GeneticResearch/screeningsets.asp for the Screening Set
from which their genotypes were obtained (Screening Sets
no. 10, 13, or 52), with seven exceptions. The primer pair
for GTTTT002P was not present in the primer sequence
file for Screening Set no. 13 from which its genotypes were
obtained, but it was available for Screening Set no. 53. The
primer pairs for MFD424-TTTA003, GATA23G09,
AAT238, TTTA063, ATA008, and ATA43C09 were not
present in the primer sequence file for Screening Set no.

52 from which their genotypes were obtained, but they
were available for the preceding Screening Set no. 51. For
each of these seven microsatellites, the chromosomal
location and allele size range provided for the microsatellite in Marshfield Screening Set 53 or 51 matched that
given in Screening Set 13 or 52, respectively. Primers for
these seven microsatellites were therefore taken from
these alternate Screening Sets as proxies for the desired
Screening Sets.
Screening Set no. 10 was genotyped for the Rosenberg et
al. [26] study prior to the genotyping of Screening Sets no.
13 and 52, with genotypes from the latter microsatellite
sets being added to the original data [26] only for microsatellites not already genotyped in Screening Set no. 10.
Therefore, in instances in which a microsatellite was
present in both Screening Set no. 10 and Screening Set no.
13 or 52, primers were taken from Screening Set no. 10.
The primer pairs used in this study can be found in Table
S1 (Additional File 1).
BLAST analysis of primers and extraction of sequences
Each forward primer sequence and each reverse primer
sequence was separately used as the query sequence in
BLASTN searches of the human genome RefSeq database
[78] (release 28) using the standalone blastall application
[79] (version 2.2.18) with the repetitive sequence filter
turned off and the expected value (e) set to 1000. For each
microsatellite locus, BLASTN "hits" that aligned along the
entire length of the forward primer and that were on the
correct chromosome for the locus were identified and
were ranked by their e-value, from lowest to highest. Similarly, BLASTN "hits" that aligned along the entire length
of the reverse primer and that were on the correct chromosome for the locus were also identified and were ranked
by their e-value, from lowest to highest. The size of the
fragment demarcated by the forward primer "hit" that had
the lowest e-value and the reverse primer "hit" that had
the lowest evalue was calculated as the distance between
the terminal 5' nucleotide of the forward primer "hit" and
the terminal 5' nucleotide of the reverse primer "hit". This
fragment size was then compared against the allele size
range provided by the Mammalian Genotyping Service
[77] (henceforth "Marshfield") for the corresponding
microsatellite locus and against the allele size range
among individuals in the HGDP-CEPH data set. If the
reverse primer used to genotype a microsatellite locus had
been modified with a 6 bp pig-tail or with a single extra
adenine base, then a one letter suffix, P or M respectively,
was included in the Marshfield marker name. For those
primer pairs for which the reverse primer was listed in the
HGDP-CEPH data set as having been modified with a 6
bp pig-tail or with a single extra adenine base, the size of
the fragment demarcated by the primer pair was adjusted
by the addition of 6 bp or 1 bp, respectively, prior to com-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/612

parison with the ranges expected. For a microsatellite to
be flagged as "found" in the RefSeq database, the size of
the fragment demarcated by the forward primer "hit" that
had the lowest e-value and the reverse primer "hit" that
had the lowest e-value had to meet one of three criteria. (i)
First, it could be within both the allele size range provided
by Marshfield and the allele size range computed from the
HGDP-CEPH data set. (ii) If the fragment size was outside
one or both of these ranges, then we calculated a quantity
that we term ROS, for "range overlap score". If the smallest and largest allele sizes in the range provided by Marshfield are denoted by m and M, respectively, and the
smallest and largest allele sizes in the range computed
from the HGDP-CEPH data set are denoted by h and H,
respectively, then we define the range overlap score (ROS)
as z/d, where d = ||[m, M] ∪ [h, H]|| and z = dz* + ||[m, M]
∩ [h, H]||(1 - z*). Here z* is the indicator function 1{([m,
M] ⊆ [h, H]) ∨ ([m, M] ⊇ [h, H])}, equaling 1 if the HGDPCEPH range was a subset of the Marshfield range or vice
versa, and equaling 0 otherwise. The ROS measure was
designed for cases in which the two ranges overlapped and
neither was contained in the other; if one was contained
in the other, then ROS reduces to 1 (the notation ||[m,
M]|| for a closed interval refers to the length of the interval, M - m). A threshold ROS value of 0.290 was chosen,
as this was the smallest ROS observed between the allele
size range provided by Marshfield and the allele size range
computed from the HGDP-CEPH data set for loci for
which the size of the fragment demarcated by a primer
pair was both within [m, M] and within [h, H]. If a marker
had ROS ≥ 0.290, then it was flagged as "found" if the
fragment size was within either the allele size range provided by Marshfield or the allele size range computed
from the HGDP-CEPH data set. (iii) As the samples used
to define the Marshfield and HGDP-CEPH ranges might
not completely capture the full range of human diversity
at the loci, it is possible for the RefSeq fragment size to fall
just outside the Marshfield and HGDP-CEPH ranges. To
account for this possibility, if a marker had ROS ≥ 0.290,
then it was also flagged as "found" if its fragment size was
outside both intervals, [m, M] and [h, H], but was at most
5 bp outside the allele size range provided by Marshfield
or at most 5 bp outside the allele size range computed
from the HGDP-CEPH data set.
If the size of the demarcated fragment met one of the three
criteria, then its sequence was extracted from the human
genome RefSeq database (release 28) in fasta format using
the standalone fastacmd application (version 2.2.18).
Only one sequence was extracted per primer pair (microsatellite locus). For one microsatellite locus, D6S942, no
allele size range information was available from Marshfield. As the fragment demarcated by its primer pair was
within the allele size range computed from the HGDP-

CEPH data set, this locus was included in subsequent
analyses.

This exclusion made it possible to classify all remaining
loci by repeat unit size.

Analysis of microsatellite sequences
We consider a short tandem repeat (STR) region to be a
repeat unit of 2-5 nucleotides with four or more consecutive repeats; a microsatellite locus can contain one or
more STR regions embedded between the PCR primers
used to amplify the locus. All consecutive repeats of the
same repeat unit were considered part of the STR region.
A single interruption of one base pair or greater in a run of
consecutive repeats of the same repeat unit was considered a break in the repeat structure, and the consecutive
runs of repeats on either side of the interruption were considered to be separate STR regions, provided that each run
contained at least four repeats.

As the context of a repetitive element might be expected to
affect its behavior, the flanking sequence of the STR region
within three repeat unit lengths of its boundaries (e.g. 12
bp of sequence on either side of an STR region comprised
of a tetra-nucleotide repeat unit, a total of 24 nucleotides)
was investigated for G/C content. If a boundary of an STR
region was within three repeat unit lengths of the end of
the extracted RefSeq sequence, then all the sequence
between the boundary of the STR region and the end of
the extracted RefSeq sequence was considered as flanking
sequence. This boundary scenario occurred at the 5' end of
the sequence for four microsatellite loci (D7S3065,
D12S269, D22S1169, and D22S683) and at the 3' end of
the sequence for eleven microsatellite loci (D1S468,
D8S1132,
D12S1045,
D16S539,
GATA5E06P,
GATA6B07,
GATA29C09P,
GATA135C03M,
GATA152F04M, AGAT132, and NA.D1S.2). Only four of
these loci (D1S468, D12S269, D22S1169, and AGAT132)
were included for further analysis. The remaining eleven
loci were excluded as they each had two or more STR
regions embedded in their RefSeq sequence that had
repeat units of different sizes. If more than one STR region
was embedded in the sequence, then the sequence
between each successive pair of STR regions was included
in the analysis of the flanking sequence, regardless of
length. For the above example of a microsatellite locus
with three embedded STR regions denoted A, B, and C, the
two regions separating the three embedded STR regions,
(Aend, Bstart) and (Bend, Cstart), would be included in the
analysis of the flanking sequence along with the sequence
regions three repeat unit lengths before Astart and three
repeat unit lengths after Cend.

For each microsatellite the sequence extracted from the
human genome RefSeq database (release 28) was interrogated and all STR regions were identified. If more than
one STR region was detected, then we determined whether
or not the STR regions shared a common repeat unit. The
total number of nucleotides separating the embedded STR
regions and the total number of repeats at the microsatellite locus were also tabulated. For example, consider a
microsatellite locus with three embedded STR regions
denoted A, B, and C whose genomic positions have the
order A <B <C, whose start and end positions (in base
pairs) in the PCR-amplified DNA sequence are denoted by
Astart and Aend, Bstart and Bend, and Cstart and Cend, respectively, and that have a, b, and c repeats, respectively. The
total number of nucleotides separating the embedded STR
regions would be given by [(Bstart - Aend) - 1] + [(Cstart - Bend)
- 1], and the total number of repeats at the microsatellite
locus would be given by a + b + c.
Under the assumption that differences in PCR fragment
length are the result of differences in the numbers of
repeats in the embedded STR regions, we used the RefSeq
sequence of each microsatellite locus to calibrate PCR
fragment lengths in individual genotypes to infer repeat
number in the HGDP-CEPH data set. At each microsatellite locus, the number of repeats for a PCR fragment
length was calculated using r + (w - l)/s, in which w is the
PCR fragment length (in base pairs), l is the length of the
sequence in the RefSeq database (in base pairs), r is the
total number of repeats in the STR regions in the RefSeq
sequence, and s is the size (in base pairs) of the repeat
unit(s) of the STR region(s) embedded in the sequence of
the locus (e.g. 4 for a tetra-nucleotide repeat unit). Microsatellite loci with two or more STR regions embedded in
their sequence that had repeat units of different sizes were
excluded from further analysis as a result of the difficulty
in inferring repeat number in the HGDP-CEPH data set.

The G/C content of the flanking sequence was calculated
as y/t where y is the number of guanine (G) or cytosine (C)
nucleotides within the flanking sequence, and t is the total
number of nucleotides in the flanking sequence (e.g. 24
for a microsatellite locus with one embedded STR region
comprised of a tetra-nucleotide repeat unit).
Analysis of microsatellite diversity data
Statistical analysis was performed in the R statistical software package (version 2.7.0) [80]. The mean, minimum,
maximum, variance, and range of the number of repeats
across the 1,048 individuals were calculated from the calibrated HGDP-CEPH data set. The number of distinct alleles and mean fragment size across the 1,048 individuals
were calculated from the PCR fragment size data set. The

variance (σ2) in the number of repeats for each microsatellite locus was calculated using the equation

∑i =1 f i(x i − x )2 /((∑i =1 f i ) − 1) , in which fi and xi are the
k

k

number of observations of allele i and the number of
repeats in allele i, respectively, x is the mean number of
repeats, and k is the number of distinct alleles.
The skewness in the distribution of the number of repeats
(γ1), potentially reflecting the biases of a microsatellite
toward expansion or contraction [81-85], was calculated
for each microsatellite locus from the calibrated HGDPCEPH data set using the skewness function (moment
method) in the fBasics R-package. This function uses equation [∑ j =1 (( g j − x ) 3 / | σ |3 )] /(2n) , in which gj is the
2n

number of repeats in observation j (among the 2n total
observations for n individuals) and |σ| is the standard
deviation in the number of repeats. Because γ1 can be
either a positive or negative value, loci with negative values of γ1 and loci with positive values of γ1 were considered separately. No loci had γ1 equal to 0.
Expected heterozygosity (He) was estimated for each microsatellite locus by treating all 1,048 individuals in the
calibrated HGDP-CEPH data set as a single population
and using the estimator [2n /(2n − 1)][1 − ∑ i =1 p i2 ] . In this
k

formula, n is the number of individuals (excluding individuals with missing genotype data), k is the number of
ˆ
distinct alleles, and p i is the relative frequency of allele i
in the sample. An alternative approach might have
involved separately estimating the expected heterozygosity for each locus in each of the 53 populations in the data
set, and using the mean heterozygosity across populations
for each locus in our analyses. This approach produces
values that are highly correlated with those obtained by
treating all 1,048 individuals as a single population, as the
Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (r)
between values obtained by treating all 1,048 individuals
as one population and values obtained by taking the
mean heterozygosity across all populations was 0.946.
Computation of Spearman's ρ correlation coefficient, the
Wilxcoxon rank-sum test, and the Kruskal-Wallis test were
performed using functions in the stats R-package.

Results
Microsatellite RefSeq sequence extraction and analysis
Primer pairs were successfully obtained for all 783 microsatellite loci, and BLAST analysis of these primer pairs
against the human genome RefSeq database (release 28)

found that each of the 783 primer pairs identified targets
on the correct chromosome for its associated locus. Of the
783 microsatellite loci, 748 (95.5%) were retained for further analysis (Figure 1). Five loci were excluded because
the allele size range provided by Marshfield and the allele
size range computed from the HGDP-CEPH data set did
not overlap. Twenty-eight loci were excluded because the
size of the fragment identified in the RefSeq database was
more than 5 bp outside the allele size range provided by
Marshfield and more than 5 bp outside the allele size
range computed from the HGDP-CEPH data set. Two loci
(D8S262 and GAAT1F09P) were excluded because their
RefSeq fragment sizes were outside the allele size ranges
provided by Marshfield and their ROS values of 0.133 and
0.263, respectively, were below the specified threshold of
0.290.
The repeat structure of each of the 748 remaining microsatellite loci was investigated, and short tandem repeat
(STR) regions were identified (Figure 2). Loci with one
STR region embedded in their sequence with a di- (30),
tri- (133), or a tetra- (325) nucleotide repeat unit, and loci
with two (10, 15, and 97, respectively) or three (3, 2, and
12, respectively) separate STR regions whose repeat units
had the same size were retained for further analysis. The
65 and 27 loci with two or three separate STR regions,
respectively, whose repeat units had different sizes, were
excluded because of the resulting difficulty in assigning
repeat number in the HGDP-CEPH data set. The nine loci
with a single STR region comprised of a penta-nucleotide
repeat unit and the 18 loci with four or more STR regions
embedded in their sequence were excluded because of
small sample size. Two additional loci (AAT267 and
AAT249) were excluded because no STR regions were
identified within their extracted RefSeq sequence. Therefore, of the original 783 microsatellite loci, 627 (80.1%)
were retained for the population-genetic analysis (Figures
1 and 2). For each of the 627 microsatellite loci used in
the population-genetic analysis, the primer sequences,
extracted human RefSeq sequence, and repeat structure
identified within that sequence can be found in Table S1
(Additional File 1), and the values calculated for all variables can be found in Table S2 (Additional File 2).
For 390 of the 627 microsatellite loci used in the population-genetic analysis, all allele sizes in the HGDP-CEPH
were separated by exact multiples of the size of their
repeat unit (Table 1). These loci are termed "regular." The
remaining 237 loci were found to possess one or more
alleles whose sizes were not separated from their flanking
alleles by exact multiples of the size of their repeat unit
("irregular"). In most cases, ~2/3 of the loci in locus classifications with a tri- or tetra-nucleotide repeat unit were
"regular," and the remaining ~1/3 of the loci were "irregular" (Table 1). For di-nucleotide loci, the corresponding

Mosaic plots describing microsatellites with (A) one, (B) two or (C) three separate STR regions. In the mosaic
plots [117,118], tiles represent categories of microsatellites, and the area of each tile is proportional to the number of microsatellites in the corresponding category. For loci with two or more STR regions, loci are first grouped by the relationships
between the repeat units in their STR regions - identical ("A=B"), similar ("A≈B"; 1 bp difference between their sequences), or
different by more than 1 bp ("A≠B") - and by the sizes of those repeat units (i.e. di-, tri-, tetra-, or penta-nucleotide, with
"mixed" referring to loci whose STR regions are comprised of repeat units of different sizes). Each group of loci is partitioned
into distinct categories based on the distance (in nucleotides) separating their STR regions, as described below the plot, and
each category is represented in a different color. Black bars represent groups that contain no loci. Filled circles represent
those categories within a group that contain no loci. For microsatellites with two STR regions, n represents the number of

fractions were ~4/5 "regular" loci and ~1/5 "irregular"
loci.
Relationship of microsatellite sequence properties and
microsatellite heterozygosity
Chromosome
Microsatellite heterozygosity did not vary significantly
across chromosomes in separate tests for di-, tri-, or tetranucleotide microsatellite loci with one, two, or three separate STR regions (P > 0.05 in all comparisons, KruskalWallis test), nor did any of the microsatellite sequence
properties or measures of variation across individuals
(Table S3, Kruskal-Wallis tests; Additional File 3). Note,
however, that many of the Kruskal-Wallis tests would
have had little power to detect a difference across chromosomes, as a consequence of small ratios of the number of
loci to the number of chromosomes.

Repeat unit size
In agreement with several previous reports [73,86-88], we
found that heterozygosity was inversely related to the size
of the STR region's repeat unit in microsatellite loci with a
single embedded STR region (P = 0.005, Kruskal-Wallis
test; Table 2). Loci with a di-nucleotide repeat unit had
higher heterozygosity than loci with a tri-nucleotide
repeat unit (P = 0.027, Wilcoxon test); di-nucleotide loci
also had higher heterozygosity than loci with a tetranucleotide repeat unit (P = 0.002, Wilcoxon test), as did
loci with a tri-nucleotide repeat unit (P = 0.046, Wilcoxon
test). However, the inverse relationship between repeat
unit size and heterozygosity was not observed in microsatellite loci with two separate STR regions (Table 2).
Although loci with two separate di-nucleotide STR regions
had higher heterozygosity than loci with two separate trinucleotide STR regions (P = 0.041, Wilcoxon test), the latter were found to have lower heterozygosity than loci with
two separate tetra-nucleotide STR regions (P = 0.064, Wilcoxon test). However, fewer loci were examined in these
comparisons than in comparisons involving only one STR
region.

P values are shown for two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for
differences in heterozygosity (He) between microsatellites with
different repeat unit sizes. Loci are grouped by whether they had one
or two separate STR regions. No comparisons were made for loci
with three separate STR regions because of small sample size for dinucleotide and tri-nucleotide loci (3 and 2, respectively). Tests with P
< 0.05 are highlighted in bold.

Repeat unit sequence
Among microsatellite loci with a single embedded tetranucleotide STR region, the sequence of the repeat unit was
found to have a significant effect on microsatellite heterozygosity (P = 0.026, Kruskal-Wallis test). This overall
effect is visible in pairwise comparisons of different tetranucleotide repeat unit sequences (Table 3). Loci with
repeat unit AAGG or its reverse complement TTCC were
found to have significantly higher heterozygosity than loci
with repeat unit AAAT or its reverse complement TTTA (P
= 4.80 × 10-5, Wilcoxon test), as were loci with repeat unit
ATCT or its reverse complement TAGA (P = 4.49 × 10-4,
Wilcoxon test). In general, we observed a trend between
increases in the number of guanine (G) and cytosine (C)
nucleotides in the repeat unit sequence and increases in
heterozygosity. A comparison between the heterozygosities of the 30 tetra-nucleotide loci with no G/C nucleotides in their repeat unit sequence (mean He = 0.683),
the 268 tetra-nucleotide loci with one G/C nucleotide in
their repeat unit sequence (mean He = 0.742), and the 23
tetra-nucleotide loci with two G/C nucleotides in their
repeat unit sequence (mean He = 0.775) found that loci
with one or two G/C nucleotides had significantly higher
heterozygosity than those with no G/C nucleotides (P =
6.48 × 10-4 and P = 2.15 × 10-4, respectively, Wilcoxon
test). A similar comparison between tetra-nucleotide loci
with one or two G/C nucleotides in their repeat unit
sequence found that those loci with two G/C nucleotides
had significantly higher heterozygosity than loci with one
G/C nucleotide (P = 0.025, Wilcoxon test).

Only two repeat unit sequences were observed for microsatellite loci with a single embedded di-nucleotide STR
region (AC and GT) and only three loci possessed GT
repeats. Six repeat unit sequences were observed among

microsatellite loci with a single embedded tri-nucleotide
STR region (AAT, TTA, ATC, ATG, CTG, and AAC). However, only loci with repeat units AAT and TTA appeared
more than twice in our data set. Heterozygosity was not
significantly different between the 70 tri-nucleotide loci
with repeat unit AAT and the 57 loci with repeat unit TTA
(P = 0.279, Wilcoxon test). The lack of a significant difference in heterozygosity in this comparison possibly reflects
the relationship of these repeat units as reverse complement sequences of one another. Similarly, no significant
difference in heterozygosity was observed between the 12
loci with a single embedded tetra-nucleotide STR region
and repeat unit AAGG (mean He = 0.796) and the six loci
with repeat unit CCTT (mean He = 0.777), the reverse
complement of AAGG (P = 0.494, Wilcoxon test),
between the 124 loci with repeat unit ATCT (mean He =
0.737) and the 129 loci with repeat unit TAGA (mean He
= 0.751), the reverse complement of ATCT (P = 0.093,
Wilcoxon test), between the 15 loci with a single embedded tetra-nucleotide STR region and repeat unit AAAT
(mean He = 0.656) and the 15 loci with repeat unit TTTA
(mean He = 0.710), the reverse complement of AAAT (P =
0.106, Wilcoxon test), or between the three loci with
repeat unit ATAC (mean He = 0.692) and the five loci with
repeat unit TATG (mean He = 0.727), the reverse complement of ATAC (P = 0.786, Wilcoxon test). These results
support the explanation that for loci with a single embedded tri-nucleotide STR region, no significant difference in
heterozygosity was observed between loci with the two
different repeat unit sequences because of the reverse
complementary relationship of the two sequence motifs.
Number of distinct STR regions

increase the heterozygosity of the microsatellite (Table 4).
Loci with one STR region had lower heterozygosity than
those with two (P = 3.12 × 10-5, Wilcoxon test) or three (P
= 4.23 × 10-4, Wilcoxon test) separate STR regions. Additionally, loci with two separate STR regions had lower heterozygosity than those with three separate STR regions (P
= 0.049, Wilcoxon test). The number of separate STR
regions in loci with a di- or tri-nucleotide repeat unit, for
which fewer loci were examined, did not significantly
affect heterozygosity (Table 4).
All identical versus not all identical repeat units
For microsatellite loci with two or more separate STR
regions embedded in their sequence, the identity or nonidentity of their repeat units was not found to influence
their heterozygosity. The seven tri-nucleotide microsatellite loci with two separate STR regions and identical repeat
units did not have significantly different heterozygosity
from the eight loci that had non-identical repeat units (P
= 0.281, Wilcoxon test). Additionally, the 50 tetra-nucleotide microsatellite loci with two separate STR regions
and identical repeat units did not differ significantly in
heterozygosity from the 47 that had non-identical repeat
units (P = 0.621, Wilcoxon test), and the five tetra-nucleotide microsatellite loci with three separate STR regions
and identical repeat units did not differ significantly in
heterozygosity from the seven that had nonidentical
repeat units (P = 0.343, Wilcoxon test).
Distance separating distinct STR regions
The number of nucleotides separating two separate STR
regions with a tri-nucleotide repeat unit was found to be
positively correlated with heterozygosity (ρ = 0.568, P =
0.027). However, for di-nucleotide repeat units the
number of nucleotides separating two separate STR
regions was not significantly correlated with heterozygosity at the P = 0.05 level (Table 5). Similarly, for tetra-nucleotide repeat units the total number of nucleotides
separating two or three separate STR regions was not significantly correlated with heterozygosity (Table 5).

G/C content of sequence flanking STR regions
In agreement with previous studies [70,89], the G/C content of the sequence flanking the STR region of microsatellite loci with a single embedded di-nucleotide STR
region was not strongly correlated with microsatellite heterozygosity (ρ = 0.247, P = 0.188). The G/C content of the
sequence flanking the STR region of loci with a single
embedded tri- or tetra-nucleotide STR region was also not
significantly correlated with heterozygosity (Table 5).
Similarly, we found no significant correlation between G/
C content of the sequence flanking the STR regions and
heterozygosity for di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotide loci with
two separate STR regions, or for tetra-nucleotide loci with
three separate STR regions (Table 5).
Relationship of microsatellite population properties and
microsatellite heterozygosity
A summary of the mean, minimum, and maximum values
across loci for microsatellite population properties
appears in Table S4 (Additional File 4).
Number of distinct alleles
The number of distinct alleles at tetra-nucleotide microsatellite loci with one (ρ = 0.517, P = 1.34 × 10-23), two (ρ
= 0.596, P = 1.17 × 10-10), or three (ρ = 0.644, P = 0.024)
separate STR regions was positively correlated with microsatellite heterozygosity. Similarly, the number of distinct
alleles at di- (ρ = 0.424, P = 0.019) and tri-nucleotide (ρ =
0.431, P = 2.31 × 10-7) loci with one STR region embedded in their sequence was positively correlated with heterozygosity. However, the number of distinct alleles was not
significantly correlated with heterozygosity for di- and trinucleotide loci with two separate STR regions (Table 5).
Variance in the number of repeats
We found that variance in the number of repeats was positively correlated with microsatellite heterozygosity (Table
5) for tri- and tetra-nucleotide microsatellite loci with one
(ρ = 0.502 with P = 7.45 × 10-10, and ρ = 0.800 with P =
1.42 × 10-73, respectively) or two (ρ = 0.750 with P = 1.28
× 10-3, and ρ = 0.779 with P = 6.03 × 10-21, respectively)

Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (ρ) are shown for comparisons of microsatellite heterozygosity with continuous microsatellite sequence
properties and with measures of variation across individuals in the HGDP-CEPH data set. Microsatellites were classified by the number of separate
STR regions embedded in their sequence and by their repeat unit size. Hyphens indicate comparisons that were not evaluated. For three STR
regions, no comparisons were performed for di-nucleotide and tri-nucleotide loci because of small sample size (3 and 2, respectively). Correlations

separate STR regions, and for tetra-nucleotide loci with
three separate STR regions (ρ = 0.846, P = 5.21 × 10-4).
Similarly, variance in the number of repeats was positively
correlated with heterozygosity for di-nucleotide loci with
two separate STR regions (ρ = 0.636, P = 0.048). However,
no significant correlation between variance in the number
of repeats and heterozygosity was detected for di-nucleotide loci with a single STR region embedded in their
sequence (Table 5).
Range of the number of repeats
The range of the number of repeats was positively correlated with microsatellite heterozygosity (Table 5) for tetranucleotide microsatellite loci with one (ρ = 0.492, P =
3.44 × 10-21), two (ρ = 0.672, P = 4.62 × 10-14), or three (ρ
= 0.681, P = 0.015) separate STR regions. The range of the
number of repeats was also positively correlated with heterozygosity for tri-nucleotide microsatellite loci with only

one STR region embedded in their sequence (ρ = 0.326, P
= 1.26 × 10-4) and for di-nucleotide microsatellite loci
with two separate STR regions (ρ = 0.646, P = 0.044).
However, there was no significant correlation between the
range of the number of repeats and heterozygosity for dinucleotide microsatellite loci with one STR region, or for
tri-nucleotide loci with two separate STR regions (Table
5).
Skewness in the distribution of the number of repeats
The skewness in the distribution of the number of repeats
(γ1) was negatively correlated with microsatellite heterozygosity for microsatellite loci with a single tri- or tetranucleotide STR region embedded in their sequence (Table
6). Considering only microsatellite loci that had negative
γ1, the heterozygosities of the 73 loci with a single trinucleotide STR region (ρ = -0.333, P = 0.004) and the 201

Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (ρ) are shown for comparisons of microsatellite heterozygosity with skewness in the distribution of the
number of repeats across individuals in the HGDP-CEPH data set. Microsatellites were classified by the number of separate STR regions embedded

P = 2.81 × 10-5) were negatively correlated with γ1. However, if only loci that had positive γ1 were considered, the
same negative correlation between γ1 and heterozygosity
was found for the 60 microsatellite loci with a single trinucleotide STR region (ρ = -0.545, P = 6.83 × 10-6), but
not for the 124 loci with a single tetra-nucleotide STR
region (ρ = -0.043, P = 0.633). Similarly, no significant
correlation was found between γ1 and heterozygosity for
the 42 loci with two separate tetra-nucleotide STR regions
and positive γ1 (ρ = -0.225, P = 0.152) or for the 55 loci
with two separate tetra-nucleotide STR regions and negative γ1 (ρ = -0.124, P = 0.368). Additionally, no significant
correlation was found between γ1 and heterozygosity for
the 12 loci with a single di-nucleotide STR region and negative γ1 (ρ = -0.105, P = 0.746) or for the 18 loci with a single di-nucleotide STR region and positive γ1 (ρ = -0.007, P
= 0.977).
Mean PCR fragment length
In agreement with a previous report [90], we found no significant correlation between microsatellite heterozygosity
and mean PCR fragment length for di-nucleotide microsatellite loci with one STR region embedded in their
sequence (ρ = 0.040, P = 0.835). We also found no significant correlation between heterozygosity and mean PCR
fragment length for tri- and tetra-nucleotide loci with one
STR region embedded in their sequence (Table 5). Similarly, we found no significant correlation between heterozygosity and mean PCR fragment length for di-, and tetranucleotide loci with two separate STR regions. However, a
significant correlation was found for tri-nucleotide loci
with two separate STR regions (ρ = 0.571, P = 0.026).
Mean of the number of repeats
In agreement with a previous report in Drosophila melanogaster [70], we found the mean number of repeats to be
positively correlated with microsatellite heterozygosity for
microsatellite loci with one embedded di-nucleotide STR
region (ρ = 0.564, P = 1.16 × 10-3). The mean number of
repeats was also positively correlated with heterozygosity
for loci with one embedded tri- (ρ = 0.239, P = 0.006) or
tetra- (ρ = 0.134, P = 0.015) nucleotide STR region. Similarly, the mean number of repeats was positively correlated with heterozygosity for tetra-nucleotide loci with
two separate STR regions (ρ = 0.388, P = 8.45 × 10-5).
However, no significant correlation was found between
the mean number of repeats and heterozygosity for di- or
tri-nucleotide loci with two separate STR regions, or for
tetra-nucleotide loci with three separate STR regions
(Table 5).
Minimum and maximum number of repeats
In agreement with a previous report [70], we found the
maximum number of repeats to be positively correlated
with microsatellite heterozygosity for loci with a single

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/612

embedded di-nucleotide STR region (ρ = 0.465, P =
0.010). We also found the maximum number of repeats
to be positively correlated with heterozygosity for loci
with two separate di-nucleotide STR regions (ρ = 0.669, P
= 0.035). The maximum number of repeats was also positively correlated with heterozygosity for tetra-nucleotide
loci with one (ρ = 0.384, P = 7.38 × 10-13), two (ρ = 0.562,
P = 2.18 × 10-9), or three (ρ = 0.706, P = 0.010) separate
STR regions. Similarly, the maximum number of repeats
was positively correlated with heterozygosity for loci with
a single embedded tri-nucleotide STR region (ρ = 0.228, P
= 0.008). However, no significant correlation was
observed between the maximum number of repeats and
heterozygosity for tri-nucleotide loci with two separate
STR regions (Table 5). Additionally, no significant correlation was observed between microsatellite heterozygosity
and the minimum number of repeats for di-, tri-, or tetranucleotide loci with one or two separate STR regions, or
for tetra-nucleotide loci with three separate STR regions
(Table 5).

Discussion
Our study provides the most comprehensive evaluation to
date of the effect of sequence properties of microsatellites
on microsatellite variability in human populations. The
relatively large number of microsatellites examined here
has enabled us to consider the relationships with microsatellite heterozygosity of a wide variety of sequence properties.
Our results confirm the well-known relationship between
the size of the repeat unit of a microsatellite locus and the
variability of the locus [73,86,87], with larger repeat units
leading to lower heterozygosity (Table 2). In agreement
with this trend, smaller repeat unit size was also found to
lead to a higher mean number of repeats, and we observed
that a higher mean number of repeats led to higher heterozygosity (Table 5). For microsatellites with a single
embedded STR region, loci with a di-nucleotide repeat
unit had higher mean numbers of repeats (mean = 18.16)
than loci with a tri-nucleotide repeat unit (mean = 13.79;
P = 2.14 × 10-12, Wilcoxon test) and loci with a tetra-nucleotide repeat unit (mean = 12.03; P < 10-15, Wilcoxon test);
loci with a tri-nucleotide repeat unit also had higher mean
numbers of repeats than loci with a tetra-nucleotide
repeat unit (P = 3.33 × 10-15, Wilcoxon test). Previous
studies comparing loci with the same number of repeats
but different repeat unit sizes reported the same trend that
larger repeat unit size led to lower microsatellite variability [88,91], suggesting that our observed relationship
between repeat unit size and heterozygosity is not wholly
due to the correlations of both quantities with the mean
number of repeats.

We also found the composition of the repeat unit of tetranucleotide microsatellite loci to be an important factor in
predicting heterozygosity, with repeat units high in G/C
content leading to higher heterozygosity. This result
agrees with a previous study [70] that reported that of the
three most common di-nucleotide repeat units in Drosophila melanogaster (TC/AG, AT/TA, and GT/CA), microsatellite loci with repeat units GT/CA and TC/GA had
higher mutation rates than loci with repeat unit AT/TA. It
also agrees with the observations of a comparative genomics study of three unrelated chicken individuals [92] that
reported that tri-nucleotide repeat units high in G/C content had higher variability than tri-nucleotide repeat units
low in G/C content. However, it is important to note that
our results might be specific to the particular motifs available in our data set. We have only one motif that contains
no G/C nucleotides (AAAT/TTTA) and only two motifs
that contain two G/C nucleotides (GATG/CTAC and
AAGG/TTCC), and together these motifs represent only
~1/6 of the tetra-nucleotide loci we examined (30 loci
have no G/C nucleotides in their repeat motif and 23 loci
have two G/C nucleotides in their repeat motif). Additionally, of the remaining 268 tetra-nucleotide loci, 253 contain the same repeat unit (ATCT/TAGA).
Our observed correlation between increases in the G/C
content of the repeat unit of tetra-nucleotide microsatellite loci and increases in heterozygosity disagrees with a
comparative genomics study that found that tetra-nucleotide repeat units high in G/C content led to lower variability in chickens [92]. It also disagrees with the findings
of a second comparative genomics study of human and
chimpanzee orthologous tetra-nucleotide microsatellite
loci that detected no significant correlation between
repeat unit composition and the average squared difference in the number of repeats between orthologs [91].
The two comparative genomics studies differ from ours in
considering many more loci, but using many fewer individuals for estimating population diversity. Thus, differences in results between our study and the comparative
genomics studies could arise because neither of the comparative genomics studies is entirely analogous to ours:
Brandstrom and Ellegren [92] considered data from only
a small number of individuals compared to our analysis
of 1,048 human individuals, and the approach taken by
Kelkar et al. [91] is quite different from ours in being
focused on genomes of different species. It is also possible
that a difference arose from ascertainment of highly polymorphic loci in the genotyping panels used in our study
compared to the relatively bias-free approach offered by
comparative genomics. However, we have no reason to
suspect that a marker ascertainment procedure selecting
for variability would have produced a systematic difference in variability between different motifs. It is also possible that loci in our study might have experienced a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/612

greater degree of natural selection compared to the
genome as a whole. However, a previous report by Kayser
et al. [93] on 332 microsatellite loci with considerable
overlap with the loci in our study found that natural selection did influence the vast majority of the loci. Investigating scores of the iHS test for natural selection, calculated
from SNP genotype data in the three Phase I and II HapMap populations [94] in 100-Kb regions centered on each
microsatellite locus we consider here, we find that almost
all loci lie within regions that have mean iHS scores that
were not considered significant by Voight et al. (mean iHS
in CEU = 0.018, minimum = -1.048, maximum = 1.270;
mean iHS in YRI = 0.034, minimum = -0.996, maximum
= 1.797; mean iHS in ASN = 0.022, minimum = -1.331,
maximum = 1.244). Thus, natural selection is not likely to
have strongly influenced our results.
Our results regarding the effect of repeat unit composition
on microsatellite variability also disagree with the results
of Eckert et al. [95], who reported that tetra-nucleotide loci
with one G/C nucleotide in their repeat unit (AGAT/TCTA
and AAAG/TTTC) exhibited higher mutation rates than
those with two G/C nucleotides (AAGG/TTCC). However,
in our data (Table 3), loci with repeat unit ATCT/TAGA
(referred to as AGAT/TCTA by Eckert et al. [95]) had significantly lower heterozygosity than loci with repeat unit
AAGG/TTCC (P = 0.003, Wilcoxon test), suggesting that
the differences between our results and those of Eckert et
al. [95] are not necessarily a consequence of differences in
the sequence composition of the repeat units. Our data set
was obtained by genotyping 1,048 individuals for each of
the 325 tetra-nucleotide loci whereas Eckert et al. [95]
used vector-based arrays of repeats in a human B lymphoblastoid cell line. The differences between the two
studies could therefore be the result of distinct cellular
environments between the two studies, as our study considers accumulations of germline mutations, whereas
somatic mutations were considered by Eckert et al. [95].
Additionally, the DNA environments differ, as we consider genomic DNA whereas Eckert et al. [95] examined
reporter constructs.
We found tetra-nucleotide microsatellite loci containing
more separate sets of repeated motifs to have generally
higher heterozygosity. This observation disagrees with
two previous reports that found uninterrupted arrays of
Drosophila melanogaster di- and tri-nucleotide repeats [72]
and human di-nucleotide repeats [1] to be more polymorphic than those that had interruptions. It also disagrees
with studies of vector-based poly-GT arrays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [96] and poly-CTG arrays in a human astrocyte cell line [97] that similarly reported that interruptions
in the array of repeats led to decreased variability. An
important difference between our study and some of
those previously reported is our inclusion of interrupted

loci whose STR regions were separated by arbitrary
lengths. We also applied a different threshold when defining runs of repeats, requiring four or more repeats before
we considered a run of repeats as an STR region, whereas
Weber [1], for example, required three or more repeats,
and Goldstein and Clark [72] required two. Another difference between our study and that of Goldstein and Clark
[72] is that we used the total number of repeats across all
STR regions at a locus, whereas their correlations with variance considered only the number of repeats in the longest run of repeats. The differences between our study and
previous studies could therefore result from differences in
experimental design. It is also possible that the correlation
we observed between more separate sets of repeated
motifs and higher heterozygosity applies to human tetranucleotide loci but not to other scenarios considered by
previous studies.
In agreement with a previous study [90], PCR fragment
size was found to have no correlation with microsatellite
variability. This is unsurprising given that PCR primer
pairs are positioned so as to optimize the amplification of
the locus, and their locations do not have intrinsic biological meaning. Because the distance from embedded STR
regions will vary among PCR primer pairs, PCR fragment
sizes do not represent absolute numbers of repeats and
therefore are not comparable in a meaningful way
between different loci. When we converted PCR fragment
sizes into underlying numbers of repeats, however, we did
find that the mean number of repeats across individuals
was positively correlated with heterozygosity. Similarly,
we found the maximum number of repeats across individuals to be positively correlated with heterozygosity. Some
of these observations might arise from a general correlation among the various measures of diversity (Tables S5
and S6; see Additional File 5 and Additional File 6, respectively); they are consistent with previous reports in Drosophila melanogaster [70,72,73] that found the mean and
maximum number of repeats to be positively correlated
with the variability of di- and tri-nucleotide microsatellite
loci, and with reports in humans [31,34] that found the
mean number of repeats to be positively correlated with
mutation rate of tetra-nucleotide loci. They also agree
with studies that reported that increases in the length of
the repetitive component of the sequence, measured in
base pairs [84,98-100] or number of repeats [91,92], led
to higher rates of mutation [84,99,100], polymorphism
[92,98], and average squared differences in the number of
repeats between orthologous loci [91].
The correlations we have observed between heterozygosity and the size and sequence of the repeat unit and the
mean and maximum number of repeats are concordant
with those reported between microsatellite mutation rate
and repeat unit size [73,86], mutation rate and repeat unit

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/612

sequence [70], and mutation rate and microsatellite
length [34,101,102]. The most commonly proposed
mutation mechanism for microsatellites is replication
slippage [4,103]; because of homology among microsatellite repeats, the two DNA strands might realign incorrectly
after polymerase dissociation and strand separation,
introducing a loop in one strand and leading to microsatellite expansion or contraction after the resumption of
replication [104]. How then can our observed correlations
between the sequence properties of microsatellites and
heterozygosity be explained in terms of their relationship
to the mutation mechanism?
The direct relationship between heterozygosity and the
number of distinct STR regions and the direct relationship
between heterozygosity and measures reflecting microsatellite length (mean and maximum number of repeats)
might very well reflect increases in the probability of slippage as a function of the number of repeats at which it can
occur [84,91,105]. Similarly, the inverse relationship
between heterozygosity and repeat unit length might
reflect the increased probability of incorrect realignment
after the dissociation of two DNA strands comprised of
small repeated motifs compared to those comprised of
large repeated motifs. For a given microsatellite length
measured in nucleotides, twice as many di-nucleotide
repeat units would exist compared to tetra-nucleotide
repeat units, with the number of tri-nucleotide repeat
units being intermediate between those of di- and tetranucleotide repeat units. During strand realignment, dinucleotide repeat units would therefore have a greater
chance of mispairing than both tri- and tetra-nucleotide
repeat units, because of the larger number of repeated
motifs present in the disassociated DNA strands; tri-nucleotide repeat units would similarly have a greater chance of
mispairing than tetra-nucleotide repeat units.
Because slippage involves the loss and reforming of
hydrogen bonds [106], the influence of the sequence
composition of the (tetra-nucleotide) repeat motif on heterozygosity, in which higher G/C content led to higher
heterozygosity, might be attributable to the higher
number of hydrogen bonds in the double-stranded DNA
offered by G/C pairs that stabilize the mispaired intermediate after DNA strand dissociation and reannealing. For
example, repeat unit AAGG would form 10 hydrogen
bonds (two per A/T base pair and three per G/C base pair)
compared to the 8 hydrogen bonds formed by repeat unit
AAAT. The two additional hydrogen bonds in mispaired
AAGG intermediates compared with mispaired AAAT
intermediates would be expected to provide increased stability, potentially enabling more of the mispaired AAGG
intermediates than mispaired AAAT intermediates to
remain paired until the resumption of strand synthesis.
However, with this reasoning, we would expect that the

Page 14 of 19

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:612

weaker hydrogen bonds for A/T pairs would cause paired
strands rich in A/T nucleotides to dissociate more frequently than paired strands rich in G/C nucleotides, providing more opportunities for A/T rich sequences to
undergo slippage-induced mutations. If hydrogen bonding is an important determinant of mutability, then the
observation that motifs rich in G/C nucleotides lead to
higher variability suggests that the effect of G/C nucleotides in stabilizing mispaired intermediates exceeds that
of A/T nucleotides in generating more opportunities for
mutation. Alternatively, we note that various studies have
suggested mechanisms by which certain motifs might produce more mutation than others [103,107-112], and it is
possible that our observation of an effect of G/C content
on variability is an artifact of a more general effect of motif
composition on variability.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/612

several hundred base pairs of DNA. As the longer read
lengths expected for "third generation" sequencing platforms [115,116] offer sequence reads capable of interrogating repetitive sequences, the resequencing of many
human individuals will allow for a more detailed examination of how the sequence properties of microsatellites
affect their variability in human populations.

Authors' contributions
In conclusion, considerations of mechanisms of microsatellite mutation suggest a view in which those microsatellite sequence properties that we have observed to
influence heterozygosity do so by altering the chance that
a mutation event will occur. Within this perspective,
increased repeat unit size acts to reduce the chance that a
mutation event occurs, thereby reducing heterozygosity;
increases in the number of G/C nucleotides in the repeat
unit, the number of distinct STR regions, and measures of
microsatellite length (mean and maximum number of
repeats) all act to increase the chance that a mutation
event occurs, thereby increasing heterozygosity.

Conclusion
By jointly considering sequence properties of microsatellites in the human RefSeq sequence together with properties of genetic diversity in human populations, we have
produced the first genome-wide systematic analysis of the
relationship between diverse microsatellite sequence
properties and features of human microsatellite variability. However, it is important to note that we have not
sequenced the microsatellites in each individual and have
instead assumed that differences in PCR fragment length
reflect differences in numbers of copies of embedded
repeat units. Further, these microsatellite loci, which we
used because they had been previously studied in a worldwide collection of individuals, might not be representative of all human microsatellites. We have no reason to
suspect that either of these issues might have systematically affected the particular comparisons that we have performed. For future work, however, comparative genomics
with multiple human genome sequences offers a relatively
bias-free approach for the random or comprehensive sampling of microsatellite loci when applied to the genome
sequences of many individuals of the same species. Current short-read next-generation sequencing platforms
[113,114] are ill-equipped to interrogate long runs of
repetitive sequences such as microsatellites that can cover
