Abstract
Background: Erythrose reductase (ER) catalyzes the final step of erythritol production, which is reducing erythrose to
erythritol using NAD(P)H as a cofactor. ER has gained interest because of its importance in the production of erythritol,
which has extremely low digestibility and approved safety for diabetics. Although ERs were purified and characterized
from microbial sources, the entire primary structure and the corresponding DNA for ER still remain unknown in most of
erythritol-producing yeasts. Candida magnoliae JH110 isolated from honeycombs produces a significant amount of
erythritol, suggesting the presence of erythrose metabolizing enzymes. Here we provide the genetic sequence and
functional characteristics of a novel NADPH-dependent ER from C. magnoliae JH110.
Results: The gene encoding a novel ER was isolated from an osmophilic yeast C. magnoliae JH110. The ER gene
composed of 849 nucleotides encodes a polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 31.4 kDa. The deduced
amino acid sequence of ER showed a high degree of similarity to other members of the aldo-keto reductase
superfamily including three ER isozymes from Trichosporonoides megachiliensis SNG-42. The intact coding region of ER
from C. magnoliae JH110 was cloned, functionally expressed in Escherichia coli using a combined approach of gene
fusion and molecular chaperone co-expression, and subsequently purified to homogeneity. The enzyme displayed a
temperature and pH optimum at 42°C and 5.5, respectively. Among various aldoses, the C. magnoliae JH110 ER showed
high specific activity for reduction of erythrose to the corresponding alcohol, erythritol. To explore the molecular basis
of the catalysis of erythrose reduction with NADPH, homology structural modeling was performed. The result
suggested that NADPH binding partners are completely conserved in the C. magnoliae JH110 ER. Furthermore, NADPH
interacts with the side chains Lys252, Thr255, and Arg258, which could account for the enzyme's absolute requirement
of NADPH over NADH.
Conclusions: A novel ER enzyme and its corresponding gene were isolated from C. magnoliae JH110. The C. magnoliae
JH110 ER with high activity and catalytic efficiency would be very useful for in vitro erythritol production and could be
applied for the production of erythritol in other microorganisms, which do not produce erythritol.
Background
Erythritol, a four-carbon polyol, occurs naturally in a
wide variety of foods including many fruits and mushrooms as well as in fermented foods such as cheese, wine,
beer, and soy sauce [1]. Because of its sweetness and
mouthfeel-enhancing property, erythritol has been used
as a low-calorie alternative sweetener in the food industry. It is also used for prevention of dental caries, since

the bacteria that cause dental caries are unable to utilize
erythritol as a carbon source [2]. In human, only about
10% of ingested erythritol is metabolized and excreted in
the urine without changing insulin level [3,4]. Therefore,
it has been used advantageously in special foods and
pharmaceuticals for diabetic patients.
Erythritol can be synthesized from periodate-oxidized
starch or dialdehyde starch by a high-temperature chemical reaction in the presence of a metal catalyst [5,6]. The
chemical process has not been industrialized because it
involves several intricate steps to get the erythritol and
the starting material is expensive. Erythritol also can be

synthesized by bioconversion that uses osmophilic yeasts
and bacteria [7,8] and it has been produced commercially
using an Trichosporonoides megachiliensis SNG-42 that
produces erythritol in high yield [9]. This whole-cell biocatalytic production process is superior to chemical substrate conversion because it is a simpler process requiring
only a few steps and is less expensive because a raw material is cheap and readily available. Recently, a high erythritol-producing yeast was isolated from honeycombs and
identified as Candida magnoliae JH110 [10]. Various biological processes using C. magnoliae JH110 and its chemical mutant have been developed for maximizing
erythritol production [11-13].
Erythrose reductase (ER) catalyzes the final step of
erythritol production, which is reducing erythrose to
erythritol with concomitant NAD(P)H oxidation [14,15].
It has been found in yeasts and bacteria with three
isozymes in a yeast strain [16]. Although there have been
several reports relating to the purification and characterization of ER from microbial sources [14,17,18], the entire
primary structure and the corresponding DNA for ER
still remain unknown in most of erythritol-producing
yeasts. Such is the case with C. magnoliae JH110 [13],
though one ER protein has been isolated from C. magnoliae KFCC-11023 [18], which is a mutant strain of C.
magnoliae JH110 treated with ultraviolet irradiation and
nitrosoguanidine for improved erythritol-producing ability [7]. Indeed, the ER-encoding genes were identified
only recently in T. megachiliensis SNG-42 [16], which is
one of the yeasts used for commercial production of
erythritol [9].
In this study, we provide the genetic sequence and
functional characteristics of a novel NADPH-dependent
ER from C. magnoliae JH110, which has different enzymatic properties from the previously reported ER of C.
magnoliae JH110 mutant strain [18]. Successful expression and characterization of the functional ER could offer
a potential opportunity to produce erythritol in other
microorganisms, which do not produce erythritol.

Results
C. magnoliae JH110 ER gene identification

By utilizing the recently constructed expressed sequence
tag (EST) library of C. magnoliae JH110 in our lab
(unpublished data), we discovered a clone containing the
ER-encoding gene from the randomly sequenced 912 EST
clones. To investigate the existence of introns in this EST
clone, PCR was performed using the C. magnoliae JH110
genomic DNA as a template. The full-sequenced PCR
product had exactly the same sequence of the EST clone,
indicating absence of intron. A 1041-bp C. magnoliae
JH110 ER (CmER) with 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions
was obtained from the C. magnoliae JH110 genomic
DNA and it harbored an open reading frame (ORF) of

849 bp with an ATG initiation codon and a TGA termination codon. This gene encodes a polypeptide of 282
amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of
31.4 kDa and an isoelectric point of 6.25. The deduced
amino acid sequence of the intronless CmER gene was
compared with other protein sequences of aldo-keto
reductase (AKR) available from the NCBI database using
the BLASTP program. The CmER showed a significant
homology to the AKR superfamily. The level of identity
showed the highest with aldehyde reductase I from
Aspergillus fumigatus (XP 754700, 44% identity), and ER1
(BAD90687, 42% identity) and ER2 (BAD90688, 41%
identity) from T. megachiliensis SNG-42. In addition, it
was also highly similar to hypothetical protein sequence
(XP 662433, 43% identity), which was annotated as AKR
in the genome sequence of Aspergillus nidulans. The
CmER exhibited no similarity to the well-studied xylose
reductases among AKR superfamily. The multiplesequence alignment analysis conducted using aldose
reductases with erythrose reduction activity showed two
conserved motifs, GYRH and AYSPL, from yeast to
human (Fig. 1). The deduced amino acid sequence of the
putative CmER gene was used for the construction of a
phylogenetic tree with full length amino acid sequences
of AKRs from various organisms [19]. In the phylogenetic
tree, the CmER was close to the well-characterized glycerol dehydrogenase coded by GCY1 from Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, aldehyde reductase from Sporobolomyces salmonicolor, and ERs from T. megachiliensis SNG-42. Furthermore, the CmER formed a family in the AKR clades
separated from other known AKR clades. This result
indicates that CmER has evolved differently from the
other AKR family members (Fig. 2).
Cloning, heterologous expression, and purification

To express CmER in recombinant Escherichia coli, the
transformant E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pCmER10 was
induced with 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 37°C. After IPTG induction for 6 h, a protein of an apparent 33 kDa molecular weight appeared as
a major band in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis (Fig. 3A). Even
though an overall expression level was quite high, the
protein was produced mainly as inclusion bodies. In
order to express the soluble and active form of CmER in
E. coli, the fusion gene approach was attempted. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) is a naturally-occurring 26 kDa
protein which is often used for the soluble expression of
heterologous proteins [20]. In addition, the GST fusion
tag with integrated protease sites has been used for convenient purification of the proteins of interest. Thus, the
CmER fused to GST at its N-terminus was expressed
under the control of the tac promoter by 1 mM IPTG
induction in E. coli BL21, which also resulted in the for-

(BAD90689), and C. magnoliae JH110 ER (FJ550210). The tetra-amino acid motif, IPKS, conserved among NADPH-dependent reductases is indicated

mation of inclusion bodies (Fig. 3B). Since it has been
reported that the co-expression of molecular chaperones
increases the soluble form of several enzymes in E. coli
[21,22], their effects on CmER expression were tested in
the transformant E. coli cells harboring pGSTCmER.
Plasmid pGro7, pKJE7, or pG-KJE3 [23] was used for coexpression of GroEL-GroES, DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE, or
GroEL-GroES-DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE, respectively. Plasmid
pGro7, pKJE7, or pG-KJE3 was simultaneously transformed with the plasmid pGSTCmER into E. coli BL21
cells. Among the chaperone families co-expressed, only
the GroEL-GroES-DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE chaperone family
exerted positive effects on soluble expression of CmER as

verified by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3C). After confirming soluble
enzyme expression, the GST-removed CmER was purified by using the affinity column chromatography after
cleavage with Factor Xa. The enzyme purity was estimated by SDS-PAGE analysis with staining of Coomassie
brilliant blue. The final yield of intact CmER was 18 mg
(~60 mg/liter of culture) of >95% pure CmER with a
molecular mass of ~31 kDa, which corresponds well to
the calculated mass (Fig. 3D).

(Table 1). The Km value for NADPH was determined to be
0.016 ± 0.01 mM. In order to study the substrate specificity of the purified CmER, a series of aldoses with different
numbers of carbon atoms (C4 - C6) and aromatic aldehyde p-nitrobenzaldehyde were tested with NADPH in
excess. Kinetic parameters of the sugar substrates tested

for CmER is summarized in Table 1. As expected, the
CmER displayed the highest activity toward D-erythrose
in the presence of NADPH. This substrate was reduced to
the corresponding alcohol, erythritol. Very low activities
were found with D-xylose and D-ribose at concentration
as high as 200 mM and no activity was detected with Dglucose, D-galactose, and D-fructose, which is consistent

with other characterized ERs [14,24]. Moreover, the
CmER shows the greatest preference for D-erythrose
based on the specificity constant (kcat/Km), and the kcat
and kcat/Km values are considerably higher for NADPH
than for NADP+ (Table 1).
Temperature and pH dependence

The activity of the CmER was maximum at 42°C when
assayed under standard conditions at temperatures ranging from 15 to 55°C (Fig. 4A). The activity of the CmER as
a function of the pH value and the buffer system was
studied between pH 4.0 and 9.0. The optimal pH was
observed at 5.5 in sodium citrate buffer (Fig. 4B) and only
about 20% of maximal activity was observed at pH of ≤
4.0 and ≥ 9.0.
Homology modeling

Using the coordinates (Protein Data Bank http://
www.pdb.org) for aldose reductase 1 (ALR1) from barley
(PDB accession code, 2BGS) and human aldose reductase
(PDB accession code, 1HQT), which have the erythrose
reduction activity; a homology model docked with
NADPH was created. Unlike other AKR enzymes, the
resulting CmER model is an (α8/β6) barrel oxidoreductase
with only one additional α-helix (H1). A hairpin (B1 + B2)
covers one end of the barrel while a NAPDH binding site
is sealing the opposite end. The H1-helix represents a
junction between strand β6 and helix α7. However, the
overall fold and binding of coenzyme were similar to the
barley ALR1 crystal structure, as depicted in Fig. 5. The
conserved catalytic residues, Trp31, Tyr60, His121, and
Trp122 (CmER residue number), from barley ALR1 have
similar orientations and locations in the CmER model.
Structures of other AKR superfamily members display
similar interactions with NADPH. In CmER, Asp54,

Asn163, Gln184, and Ser253 (CmER residue number) are
the NADPH hydrogen bond partners that are completely
conserved in the superfamily [25]. Furthermore, NADPH
interacts with the side chains of Lys252, Thr255, and
Arg258 in the CmER, which could account for the
enzyme's absolute requirement of NADPH over NADH
[24].
Discussion

We have isolated and characterized the CmER gene that
encodes erythrose reductase from C. magnoliae JH110.
AKRs, such as aldehyde reductase and carbonyl
reductase, from C. magnoliae strain have been reported
[26,27] and there are reports on the purification and
properties of ERs from only three other yeasts [14,15,28].
However, this is the first report on the entire primary
structure of the ER gene from C. magnoliae JH110, a
microorganism with the potential for industrial erythritol
production.
Initial expression of the CmER in E. coli resulted in formation of inclusion body. However, the efficiency of soluble CmER expression was improved using the
combination of GST gene fusion and molecular chaperone co-expression (Fig. 3C). Molecular chaperones are
known to play a role in protecting proteins from aggregation of unfolded or partially folded proteins in cells. It was
also reported previously that co-expression of the DnaKDnaJ-GrpE and GroEL-GroES molecular chaperone
complexes improved proper folding of product proteins
in E. coli [23]. In addition, expression of GroEL-GroES
may cooperate with DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE in a synergistic
way to increase soluble production of some proteins,
indicating that they play cooperative roles in protein folding [23]. In agreement with this synergistic effect, soluble
expression of CmER was resulted from the co-expression

of pH on the activity of CmER was determined by assaying the enzyme activity at various pH values (pH 4.0 - 9.0). The reactions were carried out at
37°C in the following buffer systems and pH values: sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.5 - 6.0), potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0 - 8.0), Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 9.0), and glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 9.0 - 10.0). The assays were performed in triplicate at each temperature and pH point.

of GroEL-GroES-DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE, i.e., co-expression of
single co-expression system (GroEL-GroES or DnaKDnaJ-GrpE) was not as effective as its combined coexpression system.
Although some AKRs utilize both cofactors, NADH
and NADPH [29,30], the CmER showed no activity in the
presence of NADH (Table 1). This is consistent with the
fact that the AKRs generally have a greater affinity for
NADPH than NADH in mammalian tissues and yeasts
[30,31]. Kinetic characteristics of purified and characterized ERs from C. magnoliae KFCC-11023, S. cerevisiae,
Torula corallina, T. megachiliensis SNG-42, Schizophyllum commune, and barley are compared in Table 2. The
CmER has a higher kcat and higher catalytic efficiencies
(kcat/Km) with respect to erythrose and NADPH. Its catalytic efficiency with respect to NADPH was 333-fold
higher than that of the next closest enzyme [24]. The Km
value for D-erythrose (8.5 mM) is comparable to the values for the ERs from T. megachiliensis SNG-42 [15], T.
corallina [28], and S. commune [32], which have Kms of
8.2, 7.1, and 5.0 mM, respectively. In addition, the
NADPH-dependent erythrose reduction was detected
whereas NADP+-dependent erythritol oxidation were not
observed, suggesting that under physiological conditions
the formation of erythritol is thermodynamically favorable in C. magnoliae JH110 and hence the CmER has
been better adapted to erythritol biosynthesis but not to
the utilization of erythritol.

The CmER gene heterologously expressed and characterized here does not appear to encode an ER previously
isolated and characterized from C. magnoliae KFCC11023, which is a chemical mutant of C. magnoliae
JH110. Due to the lack of genetic and sequence information of ER from C. magnoliae KFCC-11023, it is not certain to what degree they are different, but there are
several key differences between the two proteins. The
molecular weights and apparent kinetic constants are different (Table 1 and 2). Additionally, the previously isolated ER showed dual cofactor activity with NADH and
NADPH and preferred NADH as the cofactor. The two
enzymes differ in their pH optima and Km values for Derythrose. The enzyme, which possessed ER activity from
C. magnoliae KFCC-11023, has been reported to have the
KXXXGF(Y/G)XG motif [18]. This motif is conserved in
the xylose reductase subfamily, but is not found among
currently known ERs in T. megachiliensis SNG-42 and C.
magnoliae JH110. Although these differences could be
due to alternative mRNA splicing, posttranslational modifications in C. magnoliae JH110, or the fusion of the GST
tag, the multiplicity of ERs has been reported in the yeast
[15]. Thus, the most logical conclusion is that these are
different proteins from different genes.
Barley ALR1 exhibits 15- to 30-fold higher specific
activity toward short monosaccharides, for example DLglyceraldehyde (C3) and D-erythrose (C4), than toward
the osmoregulatory-relavant substrates such as xylose
(C5) and glucose (C6) [24]. The barley ALR1 binds with

NADPH and does not react with NADH [24]. Structural
models of barley ALR1 suggested that Tyr49 acts as the
acid base catalyst, and Asp44, Lys79, and His112 play an
important role in facilitating the hydride transfer [33,34].
All four of these amino acid residues are conserved
throughout the superfamily, including the CmER. These
enzymes have a strict requirement for NADPH. The
tetra-amino acid motif, IPKS, is conserved among these
NADPH-dependent reductases and the lysine residue in
this motif is involved in NADPH binding [35]. Although
the motif (LPKS) is present in the CmER, some amino
acid residues were not conversed around the motif. The
crystal structures of aldose reductases bound with
NADPH or an analog of the cofactor show that the
enzyme undergoes a large conformational change upon
binding with NADPH. The change involves the reorientation of loop 7 to a position which appears to lock the
coenzyme into place [36,37]. The putative loop 7 in ER
from C. magnoliae JH110 is shorter than those in other
AKRs. The Km values for NADPH were estimated to be
within the range of 2 to 4 μM for mammalian reductases
[31,38] and 37.5 μM for S. salmonicolor reductase [39].
The difference in the Km values could be due to an amino
acid sequence difference around the NADPH-bind
region. Most AKRs have a profound preference for
NADPH, but remain functional with NADH [40,41]. In
Candida tenuis XR (CtXR), which has a modest 33-fold
preference for NADPH over NADH, a structural rearrangement occurs in the active site in response to the
preference of either NADPH or NADH [42]. A similar
rearrangement is considered impossible in CmER, not
only because of its short B-loop but also due the small

side chains in the B and β6-α8 loops (Gly216 and Ser254 in
CmER versus Glu227 and Asn267 in CtXR).
Conclusions

This study provides a novel ER from C. magnoliae JH110,
which is one of the most efficient erythritol producers.
The C. magnoliae JH110 ER specifically acts on the erythrose with highly conserved NADPH binding site. The
ease of isolating this enzyme coupled with its high activity and catalytic efficiency may be useful in the in vitro
production of erythritol. The application value of this
enzyme will be tested with in situ cofactor regeneration
and heterologous expression in other microorganisms,
which do not produce erythritol.

Strains and plasmids

A C. magnoliae JH110 wild type strain [Korean Culture
Center of Microorganisms (KCCM) (formerly Korean
Federation of Culture Collection) (KFCC))-10900] was
maintained on YPS agar plate (10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L
bacto peptone, and 300 g/L sucrose) at 4°C. E. coli DH5α
was used for all DNA manipulations. E. coli BL21 and E.
coli BL21(DE3) were used as expression hosts grown in
Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (5 g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L
tryptone, and 10 g/L NaCl) supplemented with appropriate antibiotics when required. Plasmid pETR10 containing the 10 arginine tag was derived from pET29-b(+)
(Novagen, Madison, WI) [43] and used for expression of
the ER gene in E. coli BL21(DE3). An expression vector
pGEX-5X-3 (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) was used for
expression of the ER gene as a GST-tagged fusion protein.
Plasmid pGEX-5X-3 possesses a Factor Xa recognition
site for cleavage of GST from the target protein. Plasmid
encoding the molecular chaperone, pGro7, pKJE7, or
pGKJE3 in which the L-arabinose-inducible promoter
(ara BAD) was used to express GroEL-GroES, DnaKDnaJ-GrpE, or GroEL-GroES-DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE, respectively, were kindly donated by Dr. Hideki Yanagi (HSP
Research Institute, Kyoto Research Park, Kyoto, Japan).
Isolation of ER gene from C. magnoliae JH110

Random sequencing of the EST clones prepared from C.
magnoliae JH110 yielded 912 successful sequencing reactions. BLAST analysis of all the ESTs revealed that an
EST clone was highly similar to previously identified ER
of T. megachiliensis SNG-42. This EST clone was named
as putative erythrose reductase of C. magnoliae JH110
and selected for further cloning. To verify the sequence of
the putative CmER gene, the gene-specific primers, ER1
(ATGTCTTCGACCTACACCCTTAC) and ER2 (TCACCGTCTTGCTAGCGC), were designed to amplify the
sequence covering the ORF of CmER with 5' and 3' flanking regions. The PCR product was gel-purified and
cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison,
WI) to facilitate DNA sequencing. After transformation
into competent cells of E. coli DH5α, the recombinants
were identified through blue-white color selection in
ampicillin-containing LB-agar plates. The positive clones
were sequenced in both directions and the resulting
sequences were confirmed.
Sequence analysis

The searches for nucleotide and protein sequence similarity were conducted with the BLAST algorithm at the
National Center for Biotechnology Information http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast. The deduced amino acid
sequences were analyzed with the Expert Protein Analysis System http://www.expasy.org/ and protein domain
features of CmER were determined by using the Simple
Modular Architecture Research Tool [44]. The deduced
amino acid sequence of CmER was aligned with the cor-

Page 10 of 12

responding AKR sequences including ER from various
organisms using the CLUSTALW software [45]. A phylogenetic tree was constructed with MEGA 3.1 software by
using the neighbor-joining method [46]. Boostrap analysis was used with 1000 replicates to test the relative support for the branches produced by the neighbor-joining
analysis [47]. All the analyzed sequences of aldose
reductase enzymes were retrieved from GenBank and
SWISS-PROT database.
Expression and purification

After identifying the EST sequence of CmER, the CmER
gene was amplified from the C. magnoliae JH110
genomic DNA by PCR using the primer ER3 (GGAATTCCATATGTCTTCGACCTACACC, NdeI restriction
site is highlighted as bold) and ER4 (CGCGGATCCCCGTCTTGCTAGCGCG, BamHI restriction site is
highlighted as bold). The amplified CmER gene was
sequenced and compared with the sequence of the identified putative CmER EST clone to investigate the existence
of introns. For expression of the CmER gene, the amplified CmER was cloned into plasmid pETR10, resulting in
pCmER10. For fusion gene approach, the amplified
CmER with a set of primers (ER5; CGCGGATCCCCTCTTCGAACCTACACCCTTACTCG,
BamHI
restriction site is highlighted as bold and ER6; ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTCACCGTCTTGCTAGCGC, NotI
restriction site is highlighted as bold) was inserted into
plasmid pGEX-5X-3 to express the GST-fused CmER,
resulting in pGSTCmER. The constructed recombinant
vectors, pCmER10 and pGSTCmER, were introduced
into E. coli BL21 (DE3) and E. coli BL21 cells, respectively.
Transformant cells were selected on LB-agar plates containing appropriate antibiotics and cultured in LB media
at 37°C with vigorous shaking. Expression of the CmER
and molecular chaperone genes were induced at the logarithmic phase of growth (OD600 ≈ 0.5) by adding IPTG
and L-arabinose to a final concentration of 1 mM and 1 g/
L, respectively. The cells induced for 6 h were then harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C and
resuspended in 1 × PBS buffer (pH 7.4) containing the
protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) for disruption
by sonication. The crude extract was fractionated into
soluble and insoluble fractions by centrifugation at 20,000
× g for 30 min at 4°C. These fractions were analyzed by
SDS-PAGE and the soluble fraction was used for the subsequent purification of the CmER enzyme. ÄKTA FPLC
(GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences), an automated chromatography system, was used to analyze the separation pattern
of the fusion protein. The soluble fraction was directly
applied to the GSTrap FF column (1 mL, GE Healthcare
Bio-Sciences) prepacked with Glutathione Sepharose 4
Fast Flow (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). The column was
washed with 1 × PBS buffer (pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 0.5
mL/min. After washing, on-column cleavage was per-

formed using Factor Xa dissolved in cleavage buffer (1
mM CaCl2 and 150 mM NaCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.5) and then the bound protein was eluted. For removal
of Factor Xa protease, the eluate was passed directly into
the column manually packed with Benzamidine 4 Fast
Flow (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). The final eluate without Factor Xa was analyzed for the SDS-PAGE and enzymatic assay.
Determination of protein content and enzyme activity

Protein content was determined using a protein assay kit
(Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. The
CmER activity was determined as reported previously
[14] with modifications given below. Five microliter of the
purified enzyme solution was incubated in 250 μL of 50
mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 12 mM Derythrose and 4 mM NADH or NADPH at 37°C for 10
min. Immediately after the reaction, the absorbance at
340 nm was measured by an Ultrospec 4000 spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). One unit of
enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme
which produced 1 μmol of NAD(P)+ per minute under the
above conditions.
Effects of pH and temperature

The influence of pH on the activity of CmER was studied
by assaying the enzyme activity at various pH values (pH
4.0 - 9.0). The reactions were carried out at 37°C in the
following buffer systems and pH values: sodium citrate
buffer (pH 4.5 - 6.0), potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0
- 8.0), Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 - 9.0), and glycine-NaOH buffer
(pH 9.0 - 10.0). D-Erythrose was a variable substrate and
NADPH remained at a fixed concentration of 50 μM. For
the effect of temperature, the activity of CmER was determined at different temperatures between 15 and 55°C at
pH 5.5. The assays were performed in triplicate at each
temperature and pH point.
Steady-state kinetics

Kinetic parameters of purified CmER were determined by
steady-state kinetics experiments. The enzyme reaction
for D-erythrose reduction was performed at optimal pH
5.5 and temperature 42°C by varying concentrations of
one substrate (D-erythrose or NADPH) while the other
was kept constant under saturated conditions. The
kinetic parameters, Km and Vmax, were determined by
plotting the reaction rates against substrate concentrations to fit the Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
SDS-PAGE analysis

SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli [48]
using a Mini PROTEAN 3 electrophoresis system (BioRad). The gels were visualized by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250.
Homology modeling

Molecular Operating Environment (MOE, Chemical
Computing Group Inc., Montreal, Canada) was used to

Page 11 of 12

prepare and optimize the model and Insight II (version
2000; Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) was used for analysis.
To verify the model, the overall fold was checked using
Profiles-3D (Insight II), and the allowed states for φ and ψ
angles and bond distances were checked using ProStat
(Insight II), both with default settings. The Profiles-3D
check resulted in a self-compatibility score of 86.5, which
compares well to the scores of 98.3, 93.5 and 106.2 for the
coordinates from 1ADS, 1BGS and 1HQT, respectively.
The ProStat check of φ and ψ angles were determined to
be 75.2% within the allowed Ramanchandran region,
comparing well to the 87.1%, 89.4 and 84.6% for the same
analysis of PDB structures 1ADS, 1BGS, and 1HQT,
respectively and lying in the core region of the
Ramachandran plot. Therefore, our calculated results
imply that the modeled structure of CmER is reliable.
