Abstract
Background: Chloroplast genomes evolve slowly and many primers for PCR amplification and
analysis of chloroplast sequences can be used across a wide array of genera. In some cases
'universal' primers have been designed for the purpose of working across species boundaries.
However, the essential information on these primer sequences is scattered throughout the
literature.
Results: A database is presented here which assembles published primer information for
chloroplast DNA. Additional primers were designed to fill gaps where little or no primer
information could be found. Amplicons are either the genes themselves (typically useful in studies
of sequence variation in higher-order phylogeny) or they are spacers, introns, and intergenic
regions (for studies of phylogeographic patterns within and among species). The current list of
'generic' primers consists of more than 700 sequences. Wherever possible, we give the locations
of the primers in the thirteen fully sequenced chloroplast genomes (Nicotiana tabacum, Atropa
belladonna, Spinacia oleracea, Arabidopsis thaliana, Populus trichocarpa, Oryza sativa, Pinus thunbergii,
Marchantia polymorpha, Zea mays, Oenothera elata, Acorus calamus, Eucalyptus globulus, Medicago
trunculata).
Conclusion: The database described here is designed to serve as a resource for researchers who
are venturing into the study of poorly described chloroplast genomes, whether for large- or smallscale DNA sequencing projects, to study molecular variation or to investigate chloroplast
evolution.

Background
In 1991, Pierre Taberlet published what was probably the
first article recommending 'universal' polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) primers for use across plant genera and
species, with a view to analysing intra-specific variation
[1]. The approach has been favourably adopted by the scientific community: a recent search identified 855 citing
papers for the original publication (Scholar Google, 25
October 2006; up from 678 in January 2006). New sets of

primers have subsequently been published that reflect
Taberlet's original intention to study molecular variation
among closely related species, or among separate sets of
populations within species, by analysing introns and
spacers [e.g., [2-5]]. This can be done since chloroplast
genes evolve slowly, and primers can be designed with the
purpose of working across species. In chloroplast
genomes, gene order is highly conserved [2,3,5], whereas
some spacers show even intra-species variation. Amplified

fragments can be analysed by restriction analysis or DNA
sequencing. The author's experience is that small insertions/deletions (indels) are relatively frequent, when
compared to point mutations that result in restriction site
changes [6-8]. Exon sequences are generally highly conserved, but this depends on the gene in question. Molecular systematicists, starting with the highly conserved rbcL
gene, and later expanding to e.g. matK, ndhF, rpl16, and
atpB, have utilized PCR-amplified chloroplast gene
sequences for establishing and verifying phylogenies. Sets
of primers recommended for this purpose have also
expanded in size [e.g., [9-12]]. We have published a core
set of 38 primer pairs useful in the amplification of the
large single copy region in angiosperms, but also for fragments of this region in other plants [13].
As more and more partial and complete chloroplast DNA
genome sequences become available, it is apparent that a
balanced view on chloroplast sequence variation depends
on the choice of many different sites along the genome
[10,11]. It is interesting to notice that different groups of
authors tend to work with alternative sets of primers. A
central site for primer information should therefore help
in making resources that are already there more widely
known, and to encourage comparative studies across
many laboratories.

often not even mentioned in the abstract. In general, new
primers for the database were extracted from articles
describing more than one primer pair which was
anchored in conserved chloroplast regions (i.e., within
genes). Published primers cover a large section of known
chloroplasts. All sources of primer information (references) are listed online in the database (a list can be generated by sorting the database for the 'References'
column). The majority of primers are from articles
describing larger sets of primer pairs, typically more than
four. A lists of published primers was kindly provided by
Bill Hahn (Columbia University, NY, USA) in 1999. Kevin
Livingstone (Trinity University, San Antonio, TX, USA)
supplied an excerpt from the Molecular Ecology Notes database of primers regarding chloroplast-specific entries in
2004. This database is now online [17]. The latest additions are from a paper by Dhingra and Folta [18] covering
the whole inverted repeat region.
The primers were initially ordered along the tobacco
(Nicotiana tabaccum) chloroplast genome (GenBank:Z00044 and S54304), as this is the best characterised chloroplast genome to date. Orientation of the
primers (F, forward; R, reverse) is given relative to the
tobacco sequence. These manipulations were mainly
done with the Omiga 1.1.3 software (Accelrys, Oxford,
UK).

Construction and content
Published primer sequences
An overall scheme on the construction of the database is
given in Figure 1. Published articles were screened in a
random fashion for new primer information between
1999 and 2005. This included scanning the tables of contents of the following journals manually: American Journal
of Botany, Annals of Botany, Belgian Journal of Botany, Biochemical Systematics and Ecology, Biologia Plantarum, Canadian Journal of Botany, Conservation Genetics, Genetic
Resources and Crop Evolution, Heredity, Molecular Biology
and Evolution, Molecular Breeding, Molecular Ecology, Molecular Ecology Notes, Molecular and General Genetics, Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, New Phytologist, Plant
Molecular Biology, Plant Molecular Biology Reporter, Plant
Science, Plant Systematics and Evolution, Planta, Sexual Plant
Reproduction, Systematic Botany, Theoretical and Applied
Genetics, and Trees Structure and Function. Among those,
Molecular Ecology Notes contains a section of its own,
devoted to primer information. Furthermore, the following literature databases were searched, using the key
words 'chloroplast', 'PCR', and 'primer' in titles, abstracts
and key words: Current Contents Connect [14], Scopus
[15], and Forest Science Info [16]. While it is not easily
possible to check each individual article from the vast
body of scientific literature for descriptions of chloroplast
DNA variation, it is also tedious to check those with the
relevant keywords for new primer information, as this is

Filling the gaps
Together with Delphine Grivet and Remy Petit (then at
INRA-Pierroton, France), primers were designed in order
to close any remaining gaps along the large single copy
region. As a result of this collaboration, a set of 38 primer
pairs spanning this region of the chloroplast genome in
angiosperms was published [13]. The primer pairs
described in this publication [13] amplify fragments of
between 2000 and 5000 bp in most angiosperm species.
Methods for identifying conserved primer binding sites
included comparing and aligning chloroplast DNA
sequences available in GenBank by eye, with the help of
Omiga, by using BLAST [19], or by using a suite of DOS
programs written by John Antoniw [20,21]. Further primers were developed for this database following the same
strategy, in order to fill remaining gaps, to decrease the
size of amplicons, or to replace primers with poor performance in our lab. Sufficiently conserved potential
primer sites in alignments were visually checked for
abnormalities like biased GC/AT percentages, mononucleotide stretches, or apparent palindromes; sites with
such features were avoided whenever possible. In some
cases, alternative primer sites were designated in close
proximity, so that the users can select the ones best matching their taxa of interest.

Positioning primers in sequenced chloroplast genomes
BLASTALL (obtained from NCBI, USA [19]), was used to
search for homologies of the primers in 13 chloroplasts
(from GenBank, December 2005, except Populus): Nicotiana tabacum (GenBank:NC_001879.1), Atropa bellaSpinacia
oleracea
donna
(GenBank:NC_004561),
(GenBank:NC_002202.1), Arabidopsis thaliana (GenBank:NC_000932), Populus trichocarpa [Heinze et al. in
preparation, and [22]], Oryza sativa NC_001320.1, Pinus
thunbergii (GenBank:NC_001631.1), Marchantia polymorpha (GenBank:NC_001319.1), Zea mays (GenBank:X86563), Oenothera elata (GenBank:AJ2710796.2),
Acorus calamus (GenBank:NC_007407.1), Eucalyptus globulus (GenBank:AY780259.1), and Medicago trunculata
(GenBank:NC_003119.6) with an E value cut-off of 0.5.
The position of the 5' nucleotide for each primer in the 13
full genome sequences is given whenever sufficient
homology (E value below 0.5) was found. For primers
with multiple binding sites (e.g., those in the inverted
repeats), only the position of the first site is given. There

are cases where BLAST returned spurious primer binding
sites in some of the species (not in the expected position)
and these indicate possible sources for PCR artefacts.
Therefore, such primer positions are also included in the
database. Different weights were not given to matches in
the 5' or 3' ends of the primers in the BLAST search,
because in a low-complexity template as the plant chloroplast, even sub-optimal priming may lead to amplification (and consequently, artefacts).
With this data set, it is easily possible to calculate PCR
fragment sizes, and to estimate expected sizes from 'new'
taxa. Primer designations from the original publications
were retained as much as possible. Sometimes, the name
of the first author or some other hints were included in
the primer names, in order to make them unique. 'F' and
'R' are indicating the direction (forward or reverse) of the
primer relative to the tobacco sequence (some authors
have named their primers on the basis of the direction of
transcription, which can be a source of confusion here).

'P' and 'M' denote 'plus' or 'minus' primer directions in a
similar way. A few statistics for the content of the current
database (version 2.1) are given in Table 1.
Overview graphics
Most of the primers are included as 'features' in a set of
Omiga/DS Gene 1.5 (Accelrys, Oxford, UK) sequence
files. Graphics were exported from these programmes and
are available on the database website. An example is given
in Figure 2.

Utility and Discussion
Transferring PCR primers to new species has accelerated
molecular research tremendously. However, it should be
noted that from the early days of chloroplast genome
research, when probes and blotting techniques were still
in use, cross-species transfer of such gene probes was
always possible [e.g., [23]]. Nevertheless, venturing into
unknown species with primers is still a 'trial and error'
experience. It is hoped that the availability of a database
that includes alternative, tested primers for a number of
species will reduce the efforts in such cases. The database
can now easily be searched or filtered: a text field is
included which allows for free-text searching in any of the

http://www.plantmethods.com/content/3/1/4

fields. For example, this text may be a part of a gene or
primer name, an author name in the references (column
'Ref_Src'), or even a part of a primer nucleotide sequence.
Additionally, the data can be sorted for the values in any
of the fields. Numerical values (e.g., primer length or position in any of the 13 genomes) will be sorted arithmetically, and text values alphabetically. For instance, a search
and filter operation for all primers associated with transfer
RNA (trn) genes would require typing 'trn' into the filter;
the results can be sorted e.g. by species (by entering the
column number 11 for e.g. Acorus) or by gene names (column 3). Positioning the mouse over the column headings
will show the full name of the columns.
Furthermore, it is possible to combine primers from different publications into newly assembled pairs. 'Generic'
PCR conditions that favour successful amplification with
such new combinations are standard PCR conditions with
the use of 2 mM Mg2+ and a PCR program with 10 cycles
at 70°C annealing, followed by 32 cycles at 55°C or 50°C
annealing [7]. With these primers and methods, the chloroplast genomes of hitherto unexplored species can be
scanned in detail, and regions specific for different purposes picked [e.g. [7,8]].

Figure 2
Primer positions in a section of the tobacco chloroplast
Primer positions in a section of the tobacco chloroplast. Bars represent genes, and triangles represent primers, with
their respective orientations indicated by the arrows, along a stretch of the tobacco chloroplast genome.

The author's recommendation for analysing uncharacterized chloroplast genomes is the following: (i) select a
genome from the 13 listed which is phylogenetically close
to the species of interest; (ii) sort the database for primer
position in the selected genome (leaving the 'filter' field
empty so that all primers will be displayed); (iii) select
primer pairs in a suitable distance in the selected genome.
In this last step, care must be taken to select primer pairs
in the correct orientation. This can be done by comparing
the gene order in the region of interest with the one in
tobacco. In case of similar orientation of the genes, the 'F'
and 'R' designations of the primers can be used as given in
the database. In case of reverse orientation of the local
gene order (relative to tobacco) in the species of interest,
primer orientation is also reverse.
Recently, Dhingra and Folta [18] have suggested using
overlapping PCR fragments for sequencing entire chloroplast genomes from total plant DNA preparations. While
this approach holds some promise, it must be mentioned
that a number of phenomena can interfere with it. Chloroplast DNA fragments are constantly transferred to the
nucleus and to the mitochondrion [24], and extra-chloroplast DNA can lead to artefacts like apparent sequence
polymorphisms. We have encountered such polymorphisms in shotgun sequencing of the black poplar (Populus trichocarpa) genomes [Heinze et al. in preparation;
[27]]. The quality of the DNA preparation (relative
amounts of nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast

DNA) is key to the success of the PCR sequencing strategy.
Prior purification of chloroplasts, which has always been
a speed-limiting step, will determine the success to a large
degree. The advantage of using primers from this database, as opposed to a fixed set of primer pairs, is that it is
easy to switch from unsuccessful primers to alternatives,
as very often, alternative primer positions close to each
other, and degenerate sequences, have been proposed by
different authors. It is also easier to generate overlapping
sequence when primers are employed in varying combinations.
This version of the database offers the following improvements compared to earlier ones [26]: the database can
now be searched, filtered, and sorted online; there are
now more than 700 primers (up from 500+); and primer
positions are now given in 13 genomes (previously only
five). In comparison to the single article introducing the
highest number of primers [13], this database contains
almost 10 times as many primers.
We have analysed collections of wild cherry (Prunus
avium) and common ash (Fraxinus excelsior) DNAs for variation in chloroplast sequence, using either the PCR-RFLP
[25] or a denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography approach [Heinze in preparation; [8,26]]. In both
cases, it was possible to quickly screen the major part of
the large single copy region for variation between samples
collected from different sites across the species ranges. In

our laboratory, agarose PCR-RFLP is still a first screening
method with acceptable throughput, when large sample
numbers are analysed. After PCR, samples are scanned on
agarose gels for successful amplification. An aliquot of the
PCR is treated with restriction enzymes. Restriction polymorphisms and major indels can be detected in high-percentage agarose gels.
Some problems with universal PCR include the more
rapid sequence evolution in some parts of the chloroplast;
the identification of polymorphisms between conserved
primer sites (introns), and occasional rearrangements,
deletions, duplications in some genera, families, or higher
taxonomic groups. However, rearrangements often only
affect one spacer, leaving large blocks of genes with their
order conserved. It is often at the breakpoints between
conserved blocks of gene order where more sequence variation at lower taxonomic levels can be found.

References
It is tempting to speculate about poorly characterised
chloroplast DNA regions that nevertheless yield conserved primer binding sites. This happens in some
introns, but also in a number of spacers, open reading
frames (ORFs) or hypothetical conserved reading frames
(ycfs).

Conclusion

4.

Conserved 'universal' primers and markers are possible
for chloroplast DNA. Polymorphisms can be identified
with tested primer sequences from the database. 'Generic'
PCR conditions make possible the use of many primers in
new combinations. Several opportunities exist for efficient detection and analysis of polymorphisms. It is
hoped that this database will prove useful for many
diverse problems and that our knowledge of mutation
and evolution processes in chloroplasts will subsquently
be enhanced, making it possible in the future to postulate
informed predictions for poorly characterized species.
Additions to the database (by e-mail to the author) are
