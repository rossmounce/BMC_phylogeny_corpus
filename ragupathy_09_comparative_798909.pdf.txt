Abstract
Background: With the advent of entry inhibitors, monitoring of viral tropism in the clinical setting
is important. Conventional methods are cell-based and lengthy, therefore V3 sequence based
prediction algorithms are becoming increasingly attractive as monitoring tools. Here we report a
comparative analysis of viral tropism of strains circulating in Cameroon where diverse and
emerging variant strains are prevalent.
Methods: Viruses were isolated from 17 HIV positive individuals from three cities in Cameroon.
Ghost cell lines expressing either CCR5 or CXCR4 with CD4 or CD4 alone (NIH AIDS Reagent
Program) were used to determine co-receptor usage. HIV replication was determined by
measuring p24 antigen levels. Plasma viral load (VL) was determined using the Versant bDNA assay.
Nucleotide sequencing was performed on the V3 region and sequences were edited, aligned and
translated into amino acids as described in the algorithm. Bio-informatics tools based on the 11/25
and charge rule were used to predict co-receptor usage.
Results: The majority of patient isolates in our study were CRF02_AG or CRF02_AG containing
recombinants. Tropism of these complex viruses based on the cell culture assay was determined
to be R5 in 15/17 (88.2%) patients. However, two patient isolates were dual tropic R5X4 and had
drug-specific mutations. Of these two patients, one was on antiretroviral treatment with a VL of
20,899 copies/ml and the other was drug-naïve with 141,198 copies/ml. Genotype based prediction
was overall in good agreement with phenotype for R5 viruses, where 93% (14/15) of results were
comparable, dual tropic viruses being reported as X4 viruses by prediction.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that most HIV strains in Cameroon were R5 tropic and some
harbored drug-resistant mutations. V3 sequence based prediction compared well with cell based
assays for R5 strains and may be useful even in settings where highly diverse strains are prevalent.

Findings
Human Immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) enters the
cell by a multistep process that involves CD4 binding and
the use of co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4. Co-receptor
usage in many cases correlates with disease pathogenesis
and progression [1,2]. Furthermore, changes in viral tropism occurs in many HIV positive individuals over time,
indicated by a shift in co-receptor use from CCR5 to
CXCR4 which has been shown to generally correlate with
increased disease progression [3]. Some viruses are capable of using both co-receptors and are termed dual tropic
or R5X4 viruses. In the era of antiretroviral therapeutics,
co-receptor antagonists are now in use for treatment of
HIV infected individuals [4], and it therefore becomes
necessary to identify strains circulating in a given population or region on the basis of their tropism. This should be
helpful to clinicians by providing additional information
for better management of disease.
Currently there are two methods in practice for co-receptor determination a) bio informatics tools based on V3
sequence to predict co-receptor use and b) transfected cell
culture based methods. The latter method is widely used
in many clinical settings but is labor intensive and time
consuming. Prediction of co-receptor usage based on V3
sequence data on plasma viral RNA may be a useful alternative tool to assist clinicians in situations where virus
culture based phenotyping methods that rely on isolation
of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from
patient specimens may not be practical while also being
labor-intensive and time consuming.
The present investigation was aimed at characterizing
genetically diverse HIV-1 strains circulating in Cameroon
in terms of co-receptor usage and comparing cell culture
based methods with V3 sequence based prediction algorithms for virus phenotyping and co-receptor usage of
complex, emerging HIV strains.
Virus isolates (n = 17) were obtained from patients attending clinics in three cities in Cameroon - Bamenda, Limbe
and Buea. Demographic information was collected in the
Performa and analyzed. Viruses were propagated in PBMC
derived from buffy coats and cell free viruses stored in liquid nitrogen for subsequent analysis. Ghost cell lines
(Human osteosarcoma cells) expressing CCR5, CXCR4
with CD4 or CD4 alone (received from NIH AIDS Reagent
Program) were used to determine co-receptor use. Briefly,
cells were seeded at a concentration of 10e5 cells/well in a
24 well plate. After 24 hours, cells were infected with 5 ng
of p24 antigen of different HIV strains, incubated at 37°C
with 5% CO2 for 2 hours, washed thoroughly and cultured in MEM media with10% FBS and antibiotics.
Appropriate controls included uninfected cells, and cells
treated with co-receptor antagonists TAK 779 (9.14 μmol/

ml) and AMD 3100 (100 ng/ml) to block CCR5 and
CXCR4. Culture supernatants were harvested at days 4
and 8 and HIV replication was determined by measuring
p24 antigen levels using the Perkin Elmer kit (Cat No:
NEK050B).
Viral RNA was isolated using the QIAGEN (Cat No:
52906) viral RNA extraction kit The V3 region was amplified by nested PCR and sequenced using primers ED31 5'CCTCAGCCATTACACAGGCCTGTCCAAAG and ES8 5'CACTTCTCCAATTGTCCCTCA and sequences were
edited, aligned in Clustal program and translated into
amino acids as described in the algorithm. Plasma VL was
determined using the Versant HIV RNA 3.0 Assay (bDNA;
Siemens, IL) for 15 of the 17 samples studied.
In our analysis, we used 11/25 and charge rule bio-informatics tool to predict co-receptor usage [5]. The positively
charged amino acids at 11/25 and net charge >5 predict
CXCR4 in the V3 loop aligned against a consensus
sequence although other positions may also be important.
The 17 viruses studied were obtained from nine males and
eight females whose ages ranged from 37-54 Yrs for men
and 20-60 Yrs for women. Because 9/17 (53%) of the
patients were on anti-retroviral therapy with Triamune
(3TC/d4T/NVP) or a combination of lamivudine(3TC)/
Stavudine(d4T) or lamivudine(3TC)/Nevirapine(NVP),
we examined the pol sequences of their viral isolates for
evidence of drug specific resistance mutations. Genotyping revealed that 5/9 (55.5%) had drug specific mutations. Of these 5 patients, 2 had drug resistance for all
classes of RT antiretroviral drugs NRTI (A62V, K65R, T69I,
V75I, F77L, F116Y, Q151M, M184V/I) and NNRTI (V90I,
V108I, Y181C, Y188L, M184I) and 3 had one or more
drug specific mutations, K103N, Y181C and G190A in the
RT region. HIV disease progression is generally associated
with high VL and X4 phenotype, therefore we determined
plasma VL for both treatment-experienced and drug naïve
patients. Those who received ARV therapy had a VL range
of <75-28987 copies/ml while drug naive patients ranged
from <75-141,198 copies/ml.
Since multiple, diverse strains are responsible for the HIV
epidemic in Cameroon, we analyzed viral sequences of
the strains to identify genetic subtype. Phylogenetic analysis of partial sequences of gp41, p17 and pol region
revealed that 53% belonged to CRF02_AG, 6% subtype F2
and 41% were Unique Recombinant Forms (URFs) (Table
1). It is interesting to note that majority of viruses were
recombinants of CRF02_AG with gene segments of other
HIV CRFs and subtypes suggesting that newly emerging
HIV strains in Cameroon may be recombinants of the predominant CRF strain with other lesser CRF variants con-

tributing to the evolving diversity of HIV in this region.
The tropism of these complex viruses based on cell culture
experiments was determined to be R5 for 15/17 (88.2%)
strains (Table 1). A possible explanation for the predominance of R5 tropism observed with the CRF02_AG viruses
we studied may be attributed to the subtype A of the env
gene segment in these strains and it has been reported earlier [6] that subtype A strains generally show CCR5 tropism. In our study virus isolates from two patients
(06CMLPH02MG; 60CMBDSH05) were found to be dual
tropic R5X4 and their genotypes were assigned as URFs.
Thus, most representative viruses circulating in the
regions we studied were classified as R5 viruses. As entry
inhibitors for CCR5 and CXCR4 co-receptors are currently
being used for HIV treatment, fast and reliable methods
for determination of viral tropism will be of value to clinicians. Many previous studies have shown that V3
sequence based prediction algorithms can be comparatively rapid and reliable for population studies [7-10].
However, the ability of such tools to accurately predict coreceptor usage of viruses in a population that harbors
genetically diverse HIV strains needs evaluation in order
to determine their appropriateness and suitability for
determination of viral tropism.
In our study, V3 sequence based prediction was found to
be in good agreement with phenotype, where 93% (14/
15) of results were comparable (Table 1). One patient isolate (07CMLPH128) was an R5 virus but genotype prediction scored it as X4 tropic because of mutations in the V3
region and a net charge of 8. For these field isolates the

combined 11/25 and charge rule based prediction was
found to be most appropriate when compared with other
methods (data not shown). Similar observations were
reported in a study with the combined use of the 11/25
and net charge rules [5]. Furthermore, eight web based
prediction algorithms when used individually to determine viral tropism, had a low sensitivity and specificity
for non-B subtypes. However, for clade B viruses, only
PSSMX4R5 and geno2pheno yielded good sensitivity and
specificity when compared with other algorithms [11].
Our study findings suggest that direct V3 sequencing may
provide an alternative to phenotypic assays for assessing
HIV-1 tropism. As reported earlier [12] dual tropic viruses
could be under estimated and we observed similar findings in our data set. Our findings are in good agreement
with earlier observations for R5 viruses that prediction
methods based on V3 sequencing are comparable with the
phenotypic method suggesting their potential applicability in clinical settings for the future.
Another observation in our limited study is that among
those who received antiretroviral therapy in our study
population, two individuals (ID = 06CMBDSH05;
06CMARC007) had resistance to all classes of RT inhibitors with the first strain showing R5X4 and the second, R5
tropism. Viruses from both individuals were classified as
URFs having CRF02_AG with CRF11 for 06CMBDSH05
and a small fragment of subtype B in the gag region for
06CMARC007 (full length, unpublished data). A third
individual (ID 06CMLPH02MG) had never received antiviral therapy but his viral phenotype was R5X4 with VL
being 141,198 copies/ml suggesting potential advancement of disease accompanied by X4 tropism and drug
resistance. Interestingly the virus was a URF composed of
the predominant strain in Cameroon, CRF02_AG with a
minor CRF37, suggesting that complex recombinants
emerging in this region could likely be dual tropic viruses.
Larger studies and data sets are needed from these regions
to further substantiate these findings and to understand
the complexity of the emerging diversity of HIV in this
region of high diversity.
Finally, although higher frequencies of drug resistance in
patients harboring X4 viruses have been reported recently
[13], in our study of the 5 individuals on therapy, we identified drug resistant mutations in four with R5 tropic and
one with X4 tropic viruses. Studies with larger sample
sizes are required to determine the impact of drug resistance on tropism and whether emergence of new recombinants, drug resistance and viral tropism play a major
role in the spread and diversification of HIV strains in
Cameroon. In conclusion, our results, based on a limited
number of specimens and viruses isolated from PBMC
sampled for phenotypic and genotypic studies indicate
that even in a geographic region where highly complex

viruses circulate, the V3 prediction algorithm compared
favorably with cell culture for R5 viruses that were predominant in this region. These findings suggest that V3
sequence based co-receptor prediction may potentially be
an alternate tool to cell culture assays for phenotypic characterization of emerging, new and diverse HIV strains in a
population where genetic diversity is high and continuing
to evolve.
