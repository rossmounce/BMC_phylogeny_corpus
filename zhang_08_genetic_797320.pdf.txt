Abstract
Genetic characterization of wild-type measles virus was studied using nucleotide sequencing of the
C-terminal region of the N protein gene and phylogenetic analysis on 59 isolates from 16 provinces
of China in 2004. The results showed that all of the isolates belonged to genotype H1. 51 isolates
were belonged to cluster 1 and 8 isolates were cluster 2 and Viruses from both clusters were
distributed throughout China without distinct geographic pattern. The nucleotide sequence and
predicted amino acid homologies of the 59 H1 strains were 96.5%–100% and 95.7%–100%,
respectively. The report showed that the transmission pattern of genotype H1 viruses in China in
2004 was consistent with ongoing endemic transmission of multiple lineages of a single, endemic
genotype. Multiple transmission pathways leaded to multiple lineages within endemic genotype.

Background
Measles virus (MV) is highly contagious and causes a disease characterized by high fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis and appearance of a maculopapular rash [1]. It is
estimated that measles still causes 345,000 deaths worldwide per year, one-third of all vaccine-preventable childhood deaths [2-4]. However, measles has been eliminated
in countries that have maintained high vaccine coverage
rates, and four of six WHO regions now have measles
elimination goals[5,6]. Other 2 WHO regions now have
measles mortality reduction goals.

The WHO Measles and Rubella laboratory Network (LabNet) has been established to monitor progress toward
mortality reduction and elimination of measles. The LabNet has grown to include approximately 700 labs in 166
countries confirming measles and rubella cases by IgM
testing. Besides serologic testing, another important function of the network is to support the genetic characterization of currently circulating measles viruses. Virological
surveillance data, when analysed in conjunction with
standard epidemiologic data, can help to document viral
transmission pathways and aid in case classification, thus

enhancing control programs [7-10]. Molecular epidemiologic data often provides important information for documenting the elimination of endemic transmission of
measles. To facilitate virological surveillance, LabNet has
standardized the nomenclature and laboratory procedures that are used to describe the genetic characteristics
of wild-type measles viruses[11]. WHO currently recognizes 23 genotypes of measles virus [11-15].
China measles lab network was set up in 2001, composed
by one national measles lab, 31 provincial measles labs
and 331 prefecture labs. Measles virology surveillance had
made a great progress. Analysis of wild-type MV circulating in China during 1993–1995 and 1998–1999 led to
the identification of a new clade, H [16,17]. Molecular
epidemiology of measles viruses in China, 1995–2003
demonstrated that genotype H1 was widely distributed
throughout the country and that China has a single,
endemic genotype. However, continued sampling of measles virus strains from the different locations around
China is needed for a more complete understanding of
their evolving in global distribution. We carried out this
study to describe the measles genotype circulating in
China in 2004 and to complement the database of genetic
characteristics of China measles strains during the control
phase of the disease.

Results
59 viral isolates were available from 16 provinces of
China (Table 1 and Fig 1). PCR products of the 59 viral
isolates in the COOH-terminus of the nucleoprotein gene
were available and then sequenced.
All of 59 measles isolates in this study clustered within
genotype H1. The results of the phylogenetic analysis of
carboxyl-terminal coding region of the nucleoprotein (N)
gene, of 59 measles isolates in this study, together with the
WHO reference strains were shown in Fig 2. The clustering
of measles viruses in China 2004 within the genotype H1
was supported by a significant bootstrap value (98% for
1000 replicates). The geographic distributions of genotypes of China isolates are shown in Fig 1. The phylogenetic analysis of all the 59 H1 measles isolates in 2004
illustrated much more complexities involved in the transmission and circulation of H1 genotype measles strain in
China. For example, there were identical isolates circulating in different provinces in the same epidemic month; In
contrast, identical sequences were sometimes detected
during different epidemic month in the same province. 59
H1 isolates were divided into 2 different cluster, 1 and 2.
51 isolates were belonged to cluster 1 and 8 isolates were
cluster 2, both of them distributing countrywide without
distinct geographical regions.
All genetic changes in the contemporary china isolates
evaluated in this study were base substitutions, and no
deletion, insertions, or frame-shift mutations. The nucleotide sequence and amino acid homologies of 59 H1 isolates were 96.5%–100% (0–16 nucleotide variation) and
95.7%–100%, respectively. Comparing with WHO H1
genotype reference strain, the nucleotide sequence and
amino acid homologies of 59 2004 H1 isolates were
97.7%–100% and 97.2%–100%, respectively.

Discussion
Measles vaccine was first used in China in 1965, and has
been administered routinely to all infants since the China
Expanded Programme on Immunization was established
in 1978[19]. With the attainment of Universal Childhood
Immunization goals, measles mortality and morbidity in
China reached lows. During 1995–2004, the incidence of
measles was <8/10,000 population, with fewer than 250
measles deaths reported each year[20]. However, outbreaks of measles continue to occur due to accumulation
of susceptible children, especially in areas of lower routine immunization coverage. China has made great
progresses in measles control and there were some characters of measles epidemic in China. For example: the traditional epidemiology characterization had changed in
recent years, that is, the season distribution was delayed
and the age distribution was changed; there was great difference among different provinces on the incidence of

measles; Outbreak was still the main form of measles in
China, the cases of measles outbreaks in 5–10% counties
were half of the total measles cases; Floating people were
the most risk population due to measles outbreak in the
cities. The measles sporadic cases in cities increased, most
of them were <8 months children and young adults. All
the provinces were divided into 2 groups based on average
annual measles incidence: group A and group B[20].
Compared with previous years, more isolates were available from group B provinces in 2004, such as Gansu,
Ningxia, Yunnan, Guizhou, which were western poor
provinces.
This study included 59 isolates from outbreak or sporadic
cases from 16 provinces in 2004. WHO measles network
set up the criterion for the specimen collection, that is, in
areas that were in the measles elimination phase, the goal
would be to obtain appropriate specimens from each
chain of transmission; and in areas that were in the measles control and mortality reduction phase, representative
samples should be obtained from outbreaks [12,21].
China is now in the phase of accelerated measles control
and different provinces were in the different phase of measles control.

The Vero/hSLAM cell line was introduced to China LabNet from 2004. Vero/hSLAM cells are Vero cells that are
transfected with a plasmid encoding the gene for the
human SLAM molecule (Ono, et al., 2001). Vero/hSLAM
cells are able to bind to both wild type isolates and laboratory adapted strains of measles viruses, and this cell line
has been recommended for use in the WHO measles and
rubella laboratory network.
Genetic analysis results showed that the H1 genotype
virus was still the predominant endemic measles virus in
China in 2004. H1 genotype measles was also detected
epidemic in Japan, Korea [22-24]. But except for H1 genotype, there was D3, D5 and D9 genotypes epidemic in
Japan. And in the neighboring country of China, there
were different genotypes epidemic, such as D4, D8 in
Nepal, D4 in Pakistan, G2 in Thailand, H2 in Vietnam. In
the west neighboring European country, there is still
country with no report of genotype information [15].
Monitoring the pattern of measles genotypes in an area
can help document the effectiveness of control measures.
In China, which still have endemic transmission of measles, virologic surveillance of cases detects a limited
number of genotypes, and Cambodia, Turkey, Vietnam

has the same situation [17,25,26]. On the other hand, in
areas where endemic transmission of virus has been interrupted, a variety of genotypes are detected, reflecting the
multiple sources of imported viruses, such as USA, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom [8,27-29]. Since
WPRO, including China, has recently initiated a program
to eliminate measles in 2012, maybe a variety of genotypes will be detected in China as the intensity of the measles control and frequent travel communication between
different countries. H1 also imported to USA from China
between 1999 and 2005.
The phylogenetic tree of 59 H1 isolates showed that evidences for multiple chains of transmission. There were
sustained chains of transmission in most of provinces.
Outbreak was the main form of measles in China. The

identical wild-type measles virus strain could induce outbreaks in different epidemiologic month in different provinces, maybe these outbreaks were caused by identical
wild-type measles viruses transmitting among different
provinces for several months and there was a mutual
transmission between provinces in different months.
Single endemic H1 isolates formed two clusters, cluster 1
and cluster 2. Cluster 1 is the predominant cluster circulating in China in 2004. There were multiple lineages in each
cluster. These data reinforce the observation that multiple
chains of transmission were present in areas that had
endemic measles. The transmission pattern of genotype
H1 viruses in China in 2004 was consistent with ongoing
endemic transmission of multiple lineages of a single,

45 representative nucleotide sequences were deposited in

EU557238.

Conclusion
This study reports virologic surveillance data obtained in
16 provinces of China during 2004. The results confirmed
that genotype H1 is the endemic genotype circulating in at
least 16 provinces of China. The virologic data were consistent with endemic measles in that multiple chains of
transmission were evident. The H1 viruses were very
diverse and formed two major clusters, which were distributed throughout 16 provinces with no apparent geographic restriction. This important baseline data
contribute to the development of improved measles control programs in China.

Methods
Specimens collection and virus isolation
Throat swab and urine samples were obtained from serologically confirmed measles cases. Clinical specimens
were inoculated onto B95a cells or Vero/SLAM (signaling
lymphocyte-activation molecule; also known as
CDw150) cells [18], and the cells were observed for cytopathic effect (CPE). Inoculated cells were blind-passaged
up to three times before being discarded. Cells were harvested when the CPE was maximal. Virus isolation was
performed by 16 provincial laboratories in China and the
viral isolates were shipped to the National Measles Laboratory, in Beijing for genetic analysis.
RNA Extraction and RT-PCR
Viral RNA was extracted from infected cell lysates using
Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's directions.
RNA pellets were dried and resuspended in 50 μl of sterile
distilled water and stored at -70 C until amplification by
RT-PCR. RT-PCR was performed using previously
described methods [6,20]. Primers MV63 (5'CCT CGG
CCT CTC GCA CCT AGT 3') and MV60 (5'GCT ATG CCA
TGG GAG TAG GAG TGG 3') were used to amplify a 676
bp fragment of the N gene including the 450 bp fragment
recommended for genotyping.
Sequence analysis
The sequences of the PCR products were derived by automated both strands sequencing with primers MV60 and
MV63 and the BigDye terminator v2.0 chemistry using
reaction conditions that were recommended by the manufacturer (ABI 373, ABI 3100, Perkin Elmer-Applied Biosystems). Sequence proof reading and editing was
conducted with Sequencer™ (Gene Codes Corporation).
Sequence data were analyzed by using version 7.0 of
Bioedit and phylogenetic analyses were performed using
Bioedit and Mega ver3.1. The robustness of the groupings
was assessed using bootstrap resampling of 1000 replicates and the trees were visualized with Mega programs.
