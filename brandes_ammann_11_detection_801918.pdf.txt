Detection and differentiation of bacterial spores
in a mineral matrix by Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR) and chemometrical data
treatment
Andrea Brandes Ammann and Helmut Brandl*

Abstract
Background: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) has been used as analytical tool in chemistry for many
years. In addition, FTIR can also be applied as a rapid and non-invasive method to detect and identify
microorganisms. The specific and fingerprint-like spectra allow - under optimal conditions - discrimination down to
the species level. The aim of this study was to develop a fast and reproducible non-molecular method to
differentiate pure samples of Bacillus spores originating from different species as well as to identify spores in a
simple matrix, such as the clay mineral, bentonite.
Results: We investigated spores from pure cultures of seven different Bacillus species by FTIR in reflection or
transmission mode followed by chemometrical data treatment. All species investigated (B. atrophaeus, B. brevis, B.
circulans, B. lentus, B. megaterium, B. subtilis, B. thuringiensis) are typical aerobic soil-borne spore formers.
Additionally, a solid matrix (bentonite) and mixtures of benonite with spores of B. megaterium at various wt/wt
ratios were included in the study. Both hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis of the spectra
along with multidimensional scaling allowed the discrimination of different species and spore-matrix-mixtures.
Conclusions: Our results show that FTIR spectroscopy is a fast method for species-level discrimination of Bacillus
spores. Spores were still detectable in the presence of the clay mineral bentonite. Even a tenfold excess of
bentonite (corresponding to 2.1 × 1010 colony forming units per gram of mineral matrix) still resulted in an
unambiguous identification of B. megaterium spores.
Keywords: Bacillus spores, infrared spectroscopy, FTIR, clay minerals, bentonite, mineral matrix

Background
Infrared spectroscopy of a chemical compound or material is based on the absorption of radiation energy in the
infrared range (near infrared, NIR, 780 nm to 2.5 μm,
12821 to 4000 cm -1 ; mid infrared, MIR, 2.5 to 25 μm,
4000 to 400 cm-1; far infrared FIR, 25 μm to 1 mm, 400
to 10 cm-1). Absorption peaks correspond to vibrations
or rotations of the chemical bonds (e.g., C-H, N-H, or
C-O) between the atoms making up the material. Because
each different material is a unique combination of atoms,
no two compounds produce exactly the same infrared

Studies, Winterthurerstrasse 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland

spectrum resulting in a characteristic infrared “fingerprint”. Consequently, infrared spectroscopy can result in
a positive identification of basically every different kind
of material. Although infrared spectroscopy has been
routinely used as analytical tool in chemistry for many
years, this technique has only recently been applied in
environmental microbiology or microbial ecology.
In 1911, W.W. Coblentz (cited by [1]) was the first to
analyze complex biological samples such as gelatine or
chitin as well as minerals (e.g., quartz, opal, and muscovite) by infrared spectroscopy. The first infrared spectroscopy analyses in biological experiments were conducted
in the early fifties. Most of them were on a more general
level (e.g., [2-5]) and only a few were applied in medical

diagnostics or in food production [6-8]. At that time, the
instruments and possibilities for subsequent data processing were much more limited than today. In the eighties,
Naumann and coworkers [9] developed efficient methods
and instruments for microbiological use in a joint project
between the Robert Koch Institute and a manufacturer of
FTIR spectrometers (Bruker, Germany).
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy in the
MIR range can be applied as a rapid and non-invasive physico-chemical method to detect and identify microorganisms [9]. More recently, methods - particularly statistical
data treatments - have been further developed to get faster
and better results. Whole living cells can be analyzed nondestructively, which allows in vivo investigations. As example, diffusive reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFT)
was used to discriminate among 36 strains of vegetative
Bacillus cells and their spores [10]. More recently, different serovars of Salmonella enterica have been discriminated by mid-FTIR in attenuated total reflection (ATR)
mode applying soft independent modeling of class analogy
(SIMCA modelling) [11]. Discrimination of endospores by
mid-FTIR in ATR mode followed by the application of
principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster
analysis (HCA), and SIMCA remained possible even after
autoclaving of the samples [12]. Libraries have been developed to relate spectral absorbance peaks of key functional
groups present in proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, or
nucleic acids [13]. Spectra of biological samples can be
divided in different regions or windows. The typical fingerprint region for microorganisms is between wavenumbers
of 650 cm-1 and 1800 cm-1 originating from cellular carbohydrate compounds and proteins. Cellular fatty acids and
lipids show peaks between 2800 and 3000 cm-1. Best classifications are obtained using spectral differences in the
amide I and II regions of 1500 to 1650 cm-1 [14]. Basic
principles and applications in biology are described in
detail by Naumann [15]. A short summary of publications
concerning the discrimination, classification, and identification of microorganisms as whole cells is given by [16].
Our aims were (i) to discriminate spores of different soilborne bacilli; and (ii) to detect bacterial spores in the
presence of a clay mineral matrix serving as a simple surrogate for soil. Most research has been done so far on
pure bacterial cultures in the absence of matrices, for
example in studies related to medicine, diagnostics, or
food production [17].

Results and Discussion
FTIR is a rapid and easy method to differentiate microorganisms down to the molecular level without the need
of a complex and often time-consuming sample preparation. For measurement in the ATR mode (reflection),
solid samples can be placed directly on the crystal prism
of the ATR accessory. Transmission mode requires

suspension for solids and always a drying step before
the measurement. Most of the studies done so far used
the transmission method. Nevertheless, Baldauf and
coworkers found ATR to give better resolution of
peaks while using less biomass compared to other FTIR
methods [18].
Bacillus species used in this study (such as B. atrophaeus, B. brevis, B. circulans, B. lentus, B. megaterium,
B. subtilis, and B. thuringiensis) are typical representatives
of aerobic soil-borne spore formers and have been isolated
from various soil environments. As an example, B. subtilis
is a typical member of spore forming bacilli. In some
cases, B. megaterium might occur in soil at high densities
[19-21]. Usually, a discrimination of Bacillus spores by
classical (e.g., microscopical) methods is rather difficult
and tedious [22]. Discrimination of vegetative cells and
spores of Bacillus circulans was possible using FTIR
and subsequent chemometrical analysis of the spectra
(Figure 1). In particular, original spectra and second derivatives thereof showed distinct inter-specific differences
between 1000 and 1500 cm-1. Differential spectra of second derivatives showed the most significant differences in
spectral ranges of 1025 to 1032, 1374 to 1376, 1440
to1455, 1616 to 1619, and 1633 to 1644 cm-1. Most important, even spores of different Bacillus species can be distinguished by chemometrical data treatment using PCA
(Figure 2). By FTIR spectroscopy, spores of Bacillus thuringiensis, B. subtilis, and B. megaterium were easily distinguished. Our data are in good agreement with results of
other investigations [23]. In some cases, however, IR fingerprints obtained by chemometrical analysis of spores
of B. atrophaeus, B. brevis, B. circulans, and B. lentus clustered close together making a discrimination difficult
(Figure 2).
When we used hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA)
instead of PCA for the discrimination of spores, similar
results were obtained and differentiation was possible
(Figure 3). However, slight differences were observed
between the statistical treatments, probably due to the
different FTIR mode applied, namely transmission
instead of ATR. Remarkably, the reclassification of
Bacillus brevis as Brevibacillus brevis based on molecular markers [24] is reflected in early branching of the
hierarchical clustering tree. Moreover, the distance trees
resulting from hierarchical cluster analysis based on
FTIR investigations of pure cultures were in agreement
to phylogenetic trees derived from classical molecular
methods based on 16S rRNA gene sequences (see e.g.,
[25]) and supports findings of other studies [26,27].
To test our ability to discriminate spores in the presence of a matrix, the ATR mode was applied to study
mixtures of pure spores and a clay mineral (bentonite).
Bacillus spores (as well as vegetative cells) usually adhere
strongly to different solid surfaces including clay minerals

such as kaolinite or bentonite [28,29]. The latter might be
used as simple matrix and a surrogate for soil. Generally,
silicate minerals (such as e.g., bentonite) strongly absorb
IR radiation, in particular in the 950 to 1100 cm-1 region

due to Si-O bond stretching, resulting in a typical IR
spectrum [30,31]. This strong background absorption
makes the determination of second phases in the matrix
(e.g., bacterial spores) rather difficult. Differential spectra

of second derivatives showed most prominent differences
in the spectral range of 1652 to 1655 cm-1, attributable to
amide I vibrational bands of proteins [13]. Our investigations show that it is possible to differentiate spore-bentonite mixtures at different mixing ratios by using
multiscaling principal component analysis of second derivatives of FTIR spectra (Figure 4). In particular, bentonite
samples with a high spore content (1:1 wt/wt) were easily
discriminated from others. Even an approximately tenfold excess of bentonite (1:8 wt/wt ratio) still resulted in
a differentiation from pure bentonite indicating the presence of Bacillus spores. In terms of colony forming
units (cfu), a 1:8 spores/bentonite ratio (wt/wt) corresponded to 2.1 × 1010 cfu per gram. In an earlier investigation, we investigated the occurrence of bacterial
endospores in soils from various locations including
grasslands (pasture, meadow), allotment gardens, and
forests, as well as fluvial sediments, using a method based
on the fluorescence of terbium [32]. Spore counts in the
range of up to 109 spores per gram of dry soil were found

Bacillus spores

Conclusions
Our study shows that spores originating from different
Bacillus species can be discriminated by applying FTIR
and subsequent multiscaling chemometrical data treatment. Additionally - and more important - spores were
still detectable in the presence of clay mineral matrix
such bentonite which was used as a simple surrogate of
soil. An important advantage of FTIR is the small
amount of sample to be used. Only a few milligrams are
needed to perform a measurement. In principle, data
processing and identification of spores or vegetative
cells can be automated. There are fully automated
devices available in other fields to identify chemical

Bacillus type strains were purchased from German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ):
Bacillus atrophaeus DSMZ 7264, Bacillus brevis DSMZ
30 (reclassified as Brevibacillus brevis [24]), Bacillus circulans DSMZ 11, Bacillus lentus DSMZ 9, Bacillus thuringiensis DSMZ 2046. Bacillus subtilis (clone BD 170)
was obtained from bio-protect (Gesellschaft für biologischen Pflanzenschutz, Konstanz, Germany). Bacillus
megaterium was from our own culture collection. All
type strains belong to the RNA group 1, except Brevibacillus brevis, which belongs to RNA group 4. All bacilli
were cultured in liquid Medium 1 suggested by DSMZ
consisting of (in g/l) peptone (5.0) and meat extract

(3.0), with a prolonged incubation of 10 to 15 days at
150 rpm and 30°C to deplete the medium. To initiate
and force sporulation, cultures were centrifuged under
sterile conditions and the pellets were transferred to a
sporulation medium with the following composition (in
g/l): NH 4 Cl (1.6); yeast extract (1.0); K 2 HPO 4 (0.9);
KH 2 PO 4 (0.6); MgSO 4 • 7H 2 O (0.2); CaCl 2 • 2H 2 O
(0.07); FeSO4 • 7H2O (0.01); EDTA (0.01); trace element
solution (1 ml/l) containing MnSO4 • H2O (0.02); (NH4)
6Mo 7O 24 • 4H2O (0.02); H3BO 4 (0.01); CuSO 4 • 5H2O
(0.01); ZnSO4 • 7H2O (0.01). After an additional incubation period of approximatively 30 days, cultures were
checked microscopically and spores were harvested by
centrifugation, washed three times with distilled water
to remove media compounds and subsequently freeze
dried. Bentonite was ground to a fine powder using a
ball mill. Spores of B. megaterium were mixed with
powdered bentonite in different wt/wt ratios (1:1; 1:2;
1:4; 1:6: 1:8) and immediately measured by FTIR without
any further treatment. To convert wt/wt ratios to colony
forming units (cfu) per gram of mineral matrix, a
3.1 mg aliquot of the 1:8 mixture was suspended in 10
mg of sterile tap water, sonicated for 1 min, and boiled
for 5 min to kill vegetative cells of contaminating microorganisms. The suspension was serially diluted and and
20 μl aliquots were plated in triplicates onto a growth
medium (HiCrome’ Bacillus Agar, Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs,
Switzerland) highly selective for Bacillus species [35].
Plates were incubated at 30°C for 48 h and colonies
counted by visual inspection.
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy

A JASCO 4200-FTIR (Brechbühler AG, Schlieren,
Switzerland) was used for the measurements in attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode using an ATR accessory equipped with a zinc selenide (ZnSe) prism. A
small amount (approximately 2 to 5 mg) of sample enough to cover the prism - was placed onto the ATR
accessory and spectra were collected. Fifty scans with a
resolution of 4 cm-1 using the ZnSe prism were averaged and used for further chemometrical analyses. For
measurements in the transmission mode, samples were
suspended in ultra pure water (18.2 Ω) and 100 μl
were pipetted onto a thin polyethylene (PE) film held
in place by in a slide mount and air dried. Spectra
were collected with the same settings as with the ZnSe
prism. Pure PE film was taken as background. Measurement range was 650 to 4000 cm -1 for ATR and
400 to 4000 cm-1 for transmission mode. Each sample
was measured in three to five independent replicates.
Chemometrical data processing

Raw spectral data were processed with JASCO Spectra
Manager 2.02.02. First, all spectra were treated as follows:

Page 6 of 7

(i) baseline correction (linear); (ii) ATR-correction (for
reflection mode only); (iii) smoothing (Savitzky-Golay,
width = 15); (iv) truncate (1800 - 650 cm -1 for ATR
mode, none for transmission mode); (v) normalization
(hightest value = 1, lowest value = 0). Subsequently, the
second derivative was calculated (Savitzky-Golay, width =
5 for ATR mode, 15 for transmission mode). Second
derivatives of corrected spectra were compared applying
hierarchical cluster analysis, HCA, applying Ward’s minimum variance method and squared Euclidian distance, as
well as principal components analysis, PCA. Statistical
analyses were performed with either the open source
software package R or SPSS 12.0.1.
