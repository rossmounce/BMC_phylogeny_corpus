Abstract

information

Conclusions: Our data support the notion that the symbiotic compartments of rhizobia genomes
are mosaic structures that have been frequently tailored by recombination, horizontal transfer and
transposition.

interactions

Results: The symbiotic plasmid is a circular molecule of 371,255 base-pairs containing 359 coding
sequences. Nodulation and nitrogen-fixation genes common to other rhizobia are clustered in a
region of 125 kilobases. Numerous sequences related to mobile elements are scattered
throughout. In some cases the mobile elements flank blocks of functionally related sequences,
thereby suggesting a role in transposition. The plasmid contains 12 reiterated DNA families that
are likely to participate in genomic rearrangements. Comparisons between this plasmid and
complete rhizobial genomes and symbiotic compartments already sequenced show a general lack
of synteny and colinearity, with the exception of some transcriptional units. There are only 20
symbiotic genes that are shared by all SGCs.

refereed research

Background: Symbiotic bacteria known as rhizobia interact with the roots of legumes and induce
the formation of nitrogen-fixing nodules. In rhizobia, essential genes for symbiosis are
compartmentalized either in symbiotic plasmids or in chromosomal symbiotic islands. To
understand the structure and evolution of the symbiotic genome compartments (SGCs), it is
necessary to analyze their common genetic content and organization as well as to study their
differences. To date, five SGCs belonging to distinct species of rhizobia have been entirely
sequenced. We report the complete sequence of the symbiotic plasmid of Rhizobium etli CFN42, a
microsymbiont of beans, and a comparison with other SGC sequences available.

Background

Nitrogen-fixing symbiotic bacteria grouped within the Rhizobiaceae, Phyllobacteriaceae and Bradyrhizobiaceae families
are widespread in nature [1]. Ordinarily known as rhizobia,
these organisms contain genomes of one or two chromosomes and several large plasmids ranging in size from about
100 kilobases (kb) to more than 2 megabases (Mb). A common feature of the genomes of rhizobia is that the genes involved in the symbiotic process are located in specific
symbiotic genome compartments (SGCs), either as independent replicons known as symbiotic plasmids (pSym) or as symbiotic islands or regions within the chromosome. Complete
genome sequences have been recently reported for Mesorhizobium loti MAFF303099 [2], Sinorhizobium meliloti
1021 [3–6], Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA110 [7] and
the non-nitrogen-fixing close relative Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 [8,9]. In addition, the sequence of the pSym of
Rhizobium species NGR234 - pNGR234a [10] - as well as that
of the chromosomal symbiotic regions of B. japonicum
USDA110 and M. loti R7A have been reported [11,12]. Genomic comparisons reveal that the chromosomes of S. meliloti, M.
loti, and the circular chromosome of A. tumefaciens have
more than 50% of orthologous genes in common [6]. A clear
syntenic relationship is observed between the circular chromosomes of S. meliloti and A. tumefaciens [8,9] and albeit to
a lesser extent, synteny is also apparent when both are compared to the chromosome of M. loti [6,8,9]. These results lead
to the hypothesis that rhizobial chromosomes have a common
ancestral origin [6,8,9]. Other genome constituents of rhizobia (that is, other chromosomes and plasmids) are thought to
be the result of subsequent events of genomic rearrangements and horizontal transfer [6,8,9], but the precise mechanisms involved in their generation have not been elucidated
so far.
Here we report the complete DNA sequence of the pSym
(p42d) of Rhizobium etli CFN42 and its comparative analysis
with other rhizobial SGCs. R. etli is the symbiont of the common bean Phaseolus vulgaris and has been widely used as
model for metabolic and genome dynamics studies [13,14]. Its
genome is composed by one chromosome and six plasmids
ranging in size from 184 kb to about 600 kb [15]. The physical
map of p42d was previously determined and was the basis for
obtaining the entire sequence [16]. In this study we show that
the SGCs are heterogeneous in sequence, gene composition
and gene order. There are only 20 symbiotic genes that are
shared by all SGCs. There are also some conserved gene clusters of related function that are present in some SGCs, but absent in others. Besides genes unique to a particular SGC,
several orthologous genes are located in different genome
contexts in other rhizobia. Other common features to all
SGCs, such as reiterated genes, pseudogenes, and a large
amount of insertion sequences (ISs), support the view that
p42d, as well as other SGCs, is a mosaic structure that may
have assembled from different genome contexts, either chromosomal or plasmidic.

Results and discussion
General features of p42d
The symbiotic plasmid p42d is a circular molecule of 371,255
base-pairs (bp) (Figure 1) that belongs to the repABC type of
replicator [17]. We identified 359 coding sequences (CDS), of
which 63% have an assigned function, 17% have homologs in
databases without an assigned function, and 20% are orphan
(Figure 1, see also Additional data file 1). The CDS distribution between the two strands is asymmetrical, with 61% of
them located in the minus strand. The plus and minus strands
were defined according to the previously reported physical
map [16]. Moreover, the plus strand contains two reiterated
nifHDK gene clusters in a clockwise orientation (NRa and
NRb, Figure 1). The main functional classes of genes identified are: transport, nitrogen fixation, nodulation and transcriptional regulation. Ten pseudogenes related to known
genes were identified that carry deletions and frameshifts at
their amino or carboxyl termini. The plasmid also contains
many reiterated sequences and a large number of elements
related to insertion sequences (ERIS) accounting for 10% of
the entire sequence. The major reiterations (28 elements)
were grouped into 12 families on the basis of their sequence
similarity (see below).
The average GC content of the plasmid is 58.1%. When genes
were classified as low, average or high GC content (using the
mean GC ± 1 standard deviation as thresholds), we observed
a clear distinction between high or low GC in some gene clusters (Figure 2a). Several hypothetical genes and the nod genes
show the lowest GC values (< 55%), whereas the highest GC
values (> 62%) were displayed by the genes for cytochrome
P450 (CPX), tra genes (TRA), and the genes for type III
(TSSIII) and type IV (TSSIV) transport secretion systems.
Similarly, when the genes were classified according to poor,
typical or rich codon usage (CU) (see Materials and methods
for details), genes with high GC also exhibited a rich CU (Figure 2b), whereas the GC-CU correlation was found to be lower
for other genes. For example, the regions that contain the nitrogenase structural genes, other nif genes (NRa, b and c, see
below), and the fixNOQPGHIS genes (FIX1) showed average
GC content but rich CU. The variable correlation between GC
content and CU levels reveals sequence heterogeneity within
p42d and suggests a dynamic structure for this plasmid, presumably as a consequence of extensive genomic rearrangements, recombination rates, lateral transfer, and relaxation
or intensification of selective pressures.

Organization of genes involved in nodulation
Most nod genes present in p42d are clustered in a region of 16
kb (NOD); however, nodA is separated from nodBC by 27 kb.
The Nod factor backbone of R. etli CFN42 is an N-acetylglucosamine pentasaccharide synthesized by the common nodA
and nodBC gene products. Modifications to this backbone
consist of methyl and carbamoyl groups at the non-reducing
end, while the reducing one is modified by the addition of a
fucosyl group that is in turn acetylated [18]. The

The highest density of nif and fix genes in p42d occurs 10 kb
upstream of NRb, in the FIX2 region. This contains the fixABCX genes that encode a flavoprotein [24] (see below); nifB,
which is needed for the synthesis of the iron-molybdenum cofactor [25]; nifW and nifZ, whose products may be required
for protection of the nitrogenase from oxygen [26,27]; and the
genes for the regulatory proteins NifA and RpoN2. The genes
nifU, nifS and hesB (also named iscN) also map in the FIX2
region. The products of these genes have been implicated in
the formation of the Fe-S cluster required for nitrogenase
complex function [28]. In R. etli CNPAF512, the inactivation
of hesB (iscN) results in a Fix- phenotype [28]. Other genes
commonly found in nif regions of rhizobia were also identified in the FIX2 region. These are the ferredoxin gene fdxN,
which is essential for nitrogen fixation in S. meliloti [29], and
the gene for the anaerobic transcriptional regulator FnrNd

refereed research

The nif and fix genes are distributed in five regions spanning
a total of 125 kb (Figure 1); the NOD cluster mentioned previously maps within this section as well. There are three copies
of the nitrogenase reductase gene nifH [22], defining the
three nif regions (NR) a, b and c (Figure 1). NRa contains nifHDK genes and a truncated nifE pseudogene; NRb contains
the nifHDKENX genes; NRc contains nifH and a truncated
nifD pseudogene. The largest reiterated regions found in
p42d correspond to NRa and NRb regions that share 4,470
identical nucleotides. The NRc region of 1,131 nucleotides is
identical to sequences within NRa and NRb. The orientation
of NRc is inverted in relation to the direction of NRa and NRb.
Recent duplications of these NR regions might underlie the
unusually high sequence identity between them. Alternatively, a mechanism of 'copy-correction' resembling gene conversion may be involved in maintaining nucleotide identity [23].

methyltransferase, fucosyltransferase and acetyltransferase
activities required for these modifications are encoded by
nodS, nodZ and nolL, respectively. It is unclear, however,
which gene product is responsible for the carbamoylation of
the Nod factor, as nodU, the most likely gene to carry out this
function, is a pseudogene. The two membrane proteins encoded by nodI and nodJ (located downstream of nodBCSU),
participate in the transport of the Nod factor to the outside of
the cell [19]. Other genes present in p42d whose homologs in
other rhizobia have a role in nodulation are nolO, nolE, nolT

recombination leading to genomic rearrangements. Black lines connect
sites for amplification or deletion events; red lines connect sites for
inversion.

The expression of nod genes depends on the activity of NodD
proteins [20], which interact with specific sites known as nod
boxes located upstream of the nod operons [21]. The sequence of the p42d revealed three nodD genes; nodD1 is
present in the NOD region while nodD2 and nodD3 are 50 kb
apart. We also predict 15 potential nod boxes (see Materials
and methods and Additional data file 2), seven of which are
associated with almost all nod genes: nodA, nodZ, nodBCSU,
nolE, nodD1, nodD2, and nodD3. The rest of the nod boxes are
located proximal to genes so far unrelated to the nodulation
process; namely, the genes bglS (β-glucosidase), yp108 (putative monooxygenase), and the orphans yh005, yh007 and
yh050. There is also a putative nod box upstream of the gene
encoding NifA, the major transcriptional regulator of the nitrogen-fixation genes. Even though the regulation of nifA is
variable among rhizobia, dependence on flavonoid induction
is unknown.

in the synthesis of the iron-molybdenum cofactor [30,31];
nevertheless, nifV is absent in the p42d and nifQ is located
upstream of nifHc in the NRc region.

RpoN regulation

encode the recently described BacS protein, highly expressed
in nodules [35]; yp010 in the putative operon for terpenoid
synthesis [36]; the fixA, hesB, and cpxA5 genes; and yp104,
which encodes a toxin-transport-related protein. The expression of yp003 (bacS) and hesB (iscN) has recently been
shown to depend on NifA [28,35].

The RpoN (σN, also known as σ54) subunit of the RNA
polymerase, encoded by rpoN, and the transcriptional activator NifA protein, encoded by nifA (both present in the FIX2
region, Figure 1), participate in the regulation of nif genes.
RpoN binds to specific promoter regions and interacts with
the NifA protein that binds to specific upstream activator sequences (UAS) [32]. In R. etli CNPAF512, two rpoN genes
have been described [33], one located in the chromosome
(rpoN1), and the other in the pSym (rpoN2). The rpoN gene
found in the p42d is orthologous to rpoN2. Regulation by
RpoN and NifA has been demonstrated for nifH a, b and c
[34]. We predicted, as described in Materials and methods,
potential RpoN-binding sites and UAS for NifA in the upstream region of several genes (see Additional data file 3).
Both types of sites were also identified upstream of other
genes; the reiterated yp003, yp021 and yp099 genes that

RpoN-like promoters were also predicted upstream of several
genes for which no associated NifA-binding sites could be detected (see Additional data file 3). Among them are the nitrogen-fixation genes fixO, nifQ and nifB; the genes for the
putative decarboxylase, pcaC1, and alcohol dehydrogenase,
xylB2. Furthermore, potential sites for RpoN were also found
in several genes of unknown function. Recently, Dombrecht
et al. [37] predicted RpoN promoter sites in all complete
rhizobial genomes and p42d; we report here a larger set of
genes potentially regulated by RpoN in p42d. It includes
genes for nitrogen fixation, electron transfer, transport, and
several of unknown function. The genes reported by Dombrecht et al. are mainly in nif and fix genes, the ferredoxins (fdxB
and N; not predicted by us), and some genes of unknown
function [37]. The differences between their results and ours

Energy supply and anaerobic regulation

Elements related to insertion sequences (ERIS)
In general, large numbers of ERIS have been found in the
symbiotic compartments of rhizobia [2,7,10,11]. The genome
of S. meliloti, however, contains a relatively low abundance of
these elements and their distribution is asymmetric; that is
ERIS are more abundant in the pSymA, especially near symbiotic genes [3]. In p42d, ERIS belonging to 12 known IS families comprise 10% of the entire DNA sequence. The great
majority of them belong to the IS3 and IS66 families. Although most ERIS represent incomplete, presumably inactive, IS sequences, some of them are organized in complete IS
elements (Figure 1).

Genome Biology 2003, 4:R36

information

The positions of some ERIS might suggest a role in plasmid
shuffling. The 125 kb region that contains most of the symbiotic genes (Figure 1) is flanked by two complete IS elements.
Both elements share identical 30 bp direct repeats at their
borders, suggesting a potential transposition capability. The
presence of the gene for an integrase-like protein (yp018) and
the fact that the 125 kb region separates the repABC and the
tra genes, has prompted the idea that the entire symbiotic

interactions

A variety of transporters, which account for 10% of the CDSs,
are scattered throughout p42d. These include several partial
and complete ABC transporters for sugars, as well as the type
III (TSSIII), and type IV (TSSIV) large-molecule secretion
systems (Figure 1).

In addition to nifA, fnrN, rpoN2, and nodD1-3, 12 predicted
genes encoding potential transcriptional regulators are
present in p42d. They belong to different families, including
LysR, AraC, Crp and GntR. The plasmid also encodes other
functions including plasmid-maintenance, electron transfer,
polysaccharide biosynthesis, melanin synthesis and secondary metabolism. The sequence of p42d revealed a putative
methionyl-tRNA synthetase that could represent a reiterated
gene or could have another functional role (for example in
antibiotic resistance) [48].

In Escherichia coli, Fnr is an oxygen-responsive global transcriptional regulator that binds to conserved boxes upstream
of several genes (anaeroboxes) [42]. By computational methods we predict 45 possible anaeroboxes in p42d (see Materials and methods). In some cases there are pairs of
anaeroboxes in the same region. For example, two anaeroboxes lie within the intergenic region of the divergent operons
fixKd and fixNOQPd and two more were detected upstream of
fixG, nocR, nodD3, and fnrNd. Other genes that display single
anaeroboxes are fixX, nifW, nifU, hemN2, psiB, hesB, mcpC,
teuB1 and some other genes of unknown function. Although
there is no direct transcriptional evidence about the expression of these genes in microaerobic conditions, previous observations suggest that several regions of p42d are activated
under these conditions [43].

The TSSIV encoded by the virB genes has been described in
several α-proteobacterial pathogens and plant symbionts
[46] (see below). It consists of a membrane channel for delivering proteins or DNA into eukaryotic cells. In p42d, a complete set of virB genes, from virB1 to virB11, is present (Figure
1). Other TSSIV correspond to the tra genes that participate
in bacterial conjugation. Although p42d is not a self-conjugative plasmid [47], it contains the traACDG genes, an oriT and
a truncated traI pseudogene (yp096), suggesting that p42d
might have lost its self-conjugative capability.

reports

In the symbiotic state, the cytochrome terminal oxidases encoded by the fixNOQP operon provide the energy required to
fix nitrogen [32]. The cytochrome production is regulated in
response to oxygen concentration and the products of fixLJ,
fixK and fnrNd genes are also known to be involved in such
regulation [40]. In R. etli, the duplicated fixNOQP operons
are differentially regulated and only the fixNOQPd is required
for symbiosis [39]. An inactive fixKd is present in p42d but no
fixJ genes have been found in R. etli CFN42 [39]. It has been
shown that FixKf controls both fixNOQP operons; loss of FixLf (presumably a fusion protein of FixL and FixJ) suppresses
fixNOQPf expression, but has only a moderate effect on that
of fixNOQPd [39]. Two fnrN genes have been described in R.
etli CFN42; one is chromosomal (fnrNchr), and the other is
on p42d (fnrNd). Both regulators participate in the activation
of the operon fixNOQPd [41].

In several pathogenic bacteria, the TSSIII translocate virulence factors into eukaryotic cells [44]. In Rhizobium this system was first found in pNGR234a [10] and it has been shown
to have a role in nodulation efficiency in some host plants
[45]. Genes that encode proteins implicated in this system are
also present in some of the SGCs [2] and were detected in the
sequence of p42d. Interestingly, a gene homologous with an
elicitor of the hypersensitive response in plants, hrpW, is exclusively present in p42d. This gene might form an operon
with pcrD, which encodes a calcium-binding membrane protein that is also part of the type-III secretion system.

reviews

The electron flux and supply of energy for the reduction of
molecular nitrogen requires the flavoprotein encoded by the
fixABCX genes mentioned above (FIX2 region, Figure 1), a
specific cytochrome oxidase encoded by fixNOQP genes, and
a cation pump encoded by fixGHIS genes. The latter clusters
in the region FIX1 (Figure 1). A second copy of fixNOQP and
fixG genes has been found in the plasmid p42f [39].

may be explained in part by the different strategies used to
construct the weight-matrices in both studies, which in our
case includes only 85 RpoN promoters whose transcription
start sites have been experimentally determined, instead of
the whole set of 186 promoters used by Dombrecht et al.

region could be a mobile element. Furthermore, some groups
of genes flanked by ERIS might have arrived in p42d as part
of composite transposons, such as the cytochrome P450 cluster (see below), the NRb region, and a putative ATPase of an
ABC transporter.

Reiterated DNA families and genomic rearrangements
It has previously been shown that p42d contains several reiterated DNA sequences [16] that can recombine, leading to genomic rearrangements [14,49,50]. The sequence of the
plasmid revealed a large amount of DNA reiteration. The major reiterated families were defined by containing a continuous stretch of at least 300 nucleotides with identical
sequence. There are 12 such families, with two or three members each (Figure 1). In addition to the nif family described
above, five families are related to ERIS and the rest are various genes such as those that encode the BacS protein [35], or
gene fragments.
As previously shown with pNGR234a [51], the DNA sequence
allows prediction, identification and isolation of the potential
rearrangements that may be generated by homologous recombination. The complete sequence of p42d will allow the
identification of the precise sites of previously identified genomic rearrangements [50]. In the present study we have
predicted the major potential rearrangements in p42d as it
was previously described [51]; these include amplifications,
deletions and inversions such as those illustrated in Figure 1.
In other SGCs the differences in number, organization, orientation and length of the reiterated elements predict specific
genome rearrangements, as exemplified by the rearrangements that involve the nifH reiteration of p42d and
pNGR234a [50,51].

Genetic information of p42d in the context of other
genomes
The putative protein sequences of p42d were compared to the
proteomes of several complete bacterial genomes extracted
from GenBank [52] (see Materials and methods) as well as to
the SGC sequences available to date (Figure 3). We identified
all pairs of potential orthologs between p42d and each of the
genomes analyzed, following the strategy and definition described in Materials and methods. As expected, the highest
percentage of orthologs common to p42d and to any other
bacterial genome was found among the nitrogen-fixing symbiotic bacteria. S. meliloti and M. loti have, respectively, 51%
and 45% of the orthologs found in p42d (see Additional data
file 5). Members of the α-proteobacterial subclass such as
Caulobacter crescentus, Brucella melitensis and A. tumefaciens (a plant pathogenic member of the Rhizobiaceae)
have from 25% to 32% of the orthologs present in p42d. The
percentage of p42d orthologs within the genomes of plant
pathogens varies from 17% for Xyllella fastidiosa to 31% for
Ralstonia solanacearum. Human bacterial pathogens such
as Haemophilus influenzae and Helicobacter pylori, those

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/6/R36

with small genomes as Rickettsia prowazekii and Mycoplasma genitalium, and the archaea compared here, display the
lowest number of shared orthologs. Instances of putative orthologs found in p42d and some complete bacterial genomes
are shown in Figure 3a. In general, a collection of orthologs
involved in diverse enzymatic activities is present in p42d and
in most genomes compared here. They include the genes
hemN1, hemN2, ctrE, hisC, icfA, pgmV, aatC, pcaC1, adhE,
ribAB, bglS, kprS, mcpG, mcpA and mmsB (see Additional
data file 1, for the assigned function). Their identity is in most
cases 50% or lower.
When we examined the distribution of orthologs in the six
SGCs (see above), including p42d and using the genomes of
M. loti and S. meliloti as reference, it was found that half of
the hits lie in the respective SGCs and the rest are dispersed
among other replicons, including the chromosomes (Table 1,
Figure 3f,3g). In general, the genes for symbiosis are very well
conserved in the SGCs, whereas the orthologs of genes not involved in symbiosis are distributed in nonsymbiotic plasmids
and in the chromosomes (Figure 3c,3d,3e).
A total of 177 p42d CDSs (49%) have orthologs at least in one
SGC. A subset of these (80 CDSs) belongs to the symbiotic region of 120 kb (Figure 3c,3d,3e,3f,3g, from NRa to NRb regions; Table 1) and the rest are interspersed in the remaining
251 kb of the plasmid. Among the SGCs compared,
pNGR234a shares the highest percentage of orthologs (30%)
with p42d (Table 1, Figure 3d), followed by the pSymA (28%)
and the SGC of M. loti R7A (Table 1, Figure 3g and 3e, respectively). The SGC of M. loti MAFF303099 and B. japonicum
share the fewest orthologs (24%) with p42d (Table 1, Figure
3f and 3c, respectively). The A. tumefaciens plasmids display
the highest similarity with the TSSIV, TRA, and REP regions
of p42d; the rest of the matches are distributed in the circular
and the linear chromosomes (Figure 3b).
There are 20 genes common to all SGCs. These correspond
exclusively to symbiotic genes including both nitrogen fixation (nifHDKENXAB, fixABCX, fdxN, fdxB) and nodulation
(nodABCIJD) genes. The essential nodBC genes, however,
have possible paralogs in some plant pathogens such as A.
tumefaciens, Ralstonia solanacearum and Xanthomonas.
Possible paralogs of the transport genes nodIJ are present in
all the genomes analyzed. In these bacterial species, putative
paralogs of nod genes might participate in the synthesis and
secretion of outer membrane lipopolysaccharides [53].

Conserved gene clusters in SGCs and other genomes
The fixNOQPGHIS common to different nitrogen-fixing symbiotic rhizobia are not always confined to the SGCs [10,11]. As
mentioned above, in R. etli CFN42, the fix genes are distributed in two replicons, p42d and p42f, and some of them are
reiterated, as is frequently observed in other genomes [2,3].
In S. meliloti, these genes are reiterated three times in pSymA
[3] and in M. loti there are two copies of the entire operon [2].

The fixABCX operon is highly conserved in diazotrophs as
well as in a wide variety of other bacterial and archaeal species such as E. coli, Mycoplasma genitalium, Bacillus subtilis, Thermotoga maritima and Archeoglobus fulgidus. In E.
coli these fix genes are related to the carnitine pathway, but
their function is unknown in the other species [55]. The
ferredoxins FdxN and FdxB are always linked to nif genes in
symbiotic as well as nonsymbiotic organisms. In S. meliloti,
mutations in fdxN significantly impair the nitrogen-fixation
process [29].

In B. japonicum they lie outside of the SGC (410 kb) determined by Gottfert et al. [11] but are included in the equivalent
681 kb SGC of the complete genome [7]. Moreover, in Rhizobium sp. NGR234 they are chromosomal [54]. The fixNOQPGHIS cluster was identified in the genome of the plant
pathogen A. tumefaciens (circular chromosome), the intracellular parasite Brucella melitensis (chromosome I), and in
the free-living aquatic bacterium C. crescentus; all of them
belonging to the α-proteobacterial subdivision. Among γ-proteobacteria, the plant pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa
has this fix cluster, which is absent in E. coli. Also, orthologs
of this gene cluster are conserved in R. solanacearum, a plant
pathogen that belongs to the β-proteobacteria.

genes; CPX gene function is not known and no symbiotic role
has so far been assigned to them. In B. japonicum some of
these genes might participate in terpenoid synthesis [36]. The
genes included in the CPX region showed similar organization in the SGC of M. loti (strains MAFF303099 and R7A), in
pNGR234a, and in p42d. In B. japonicum, the CPX cluster
was not located in the 410 kb SGC [11,36] but is present in the
680 kb SGC determined by Kaneko et al. [7]. In pSymA of S.
meliloti, this cluster is partially represented by homologs of
cpxP2, cpxP4, ctrE and some conserved hypothetical genes,
yp013-yp015. Homologs of IS are located at the right border
of the CPX region in pNGR234a and pSymA, while they are to
the left of the SGC in M. loti R7A. The CPX region in p42d is
flanked by ERIS, highlighting its potential for transposition.
A common feature in the SGCs is the presence of either the
TSSIII or the TSSIV transport secretion systems. The TSSIII
is found in pNGR234a, in the SGCs of B. japonicum, and in
M. loti MAFF303099. The TSSIV is located in pSymA of S.
meliloti and the symbiotic island of M. loti R7A. Both transport systems are present in p42d. In the pTi and pRi plasmids
of A. tumefaciens C58, the TSSIV system is used for transferring the T-DNA to plant cells. In the absence of T-DNA in the
SGCs, the precise function of these systems is not clear. Furthermore, both TSSIII and TSSIV are found in bacterial pathogens of plants and animals as well as in some αproteobacteria. Complete or partial TSSIII or TSSIV are
present in Brucella melitensis, C. crescentus, X. citri and X.
campestris, whereas in Rickettsia prowazekii, some virB
genes are conserved. P. aeruginosa contains a complete

TSSIII but lacks homologs of the TSSIV, while in Xyllella fastidiosa, nine putative conjugative proteins of the plasmid
pXF41 are clearly orthologs of the corresponding virB gene
set found in other microorganisms.

Absence of synteny among SGCs
It is generally known that gene order is conserved in closely
related strains and species. The six SGCs compared here, except the SGCs of the two M. loti strains, have 20-30% of genes
in common according to our estimates (Table 1). Most of
these genes are located within the conserved clusters described above. Furthermore, genes unique to each of the individual genomes are interspersed among genes present in all
in SGCs. For example, p42d contains 71 orphan genes
throughout its structure.
The SGCs in M. loti strains MAFF303099 and R7A share
large conserved segments that contain all the symbiotic genes
[12] (Figure 4, panel 10). The colinearity is disrupted by genes
unique to either of the SGCs. The smallest region that encloses the 20 common orthologous genes (essentially nod and nif
genes) can be delimited to about 50 kb in pSymA, 120 kb in
p42d, 250 kb in pNGR234a, 300 kb in the SGC of B. japonicum, and 320 kb in the two SGCs of M. loti (Figure 5). Such
variability in gene order suggests that the SGCs have recombined frequently with other genome elements.
Several transcriptional units that are conserved in some SGCs
appear to have undergone rearrangements in others. Examples taken from the nif, fix and nod operons are illustrated in

Sequencing strategy
A minimal set of cosmids that covers the entire p42d [16]
were used to generate shotgun libraries (1-2 kb mean insert
size) cloned in M13 or pUC19 vectors. DNA sequencing reactions were performed using the Big-Dye Terminator kit in an
automatic 373A DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA). Gaps were filled by a primer-walking strategy as
well as by sequencing appropriate clones from pBR328 and
pSUP202 libraries. A total of 6,210 readings of 450 bases in
average were collected to achieve a coverage of 7× for the entire p42d.

Assembly
Base calling was done using the program PHRED and the assembly was obtained by PHRAP [56,57]. Graphic
representation and edition of the assembly were accomplished using the CONSED program [58]. Low-quality and
single-stranded regions were located, and further sequencing
was done to cover these areas. An error rate of less than 1 per
10,000 bases was estimated using base qualities determined
by the PHRAP assembler. To confirm the assembly, pairs of

Our results indicate that p42d contains several regions that
significantly deviate from the average GC content and typical
CU. The plasmid harbors a large amount of ERIS and several
reiterated DNA families. In addition, it contains 10 pseudogenes. These features resemble those found in other SGCs. All
SGCs sequenced so far are heterogeneous regarding their
gene content, and the genes common to most of them are
mainly those involved in nodulation and nitrogen fixation.
Other common genes are present either in SGCs or in other
genome locations (see above). The lack of synteny between

Additional data file 6. The nifHDK and nifENX, are neighboring conserved transcriptional units in p42d, in the two SGCs
of M. loti, and in pNGR234a. However, nifH and nifN are separated from their respective operons in the SGC of B. japonicum and in pSymA of S. meliloti, respectively. Similarly, nodA
is located away from the nodBC genes in p42d, and nodB is
distant in the SGC of M. loti strains. The operon fixABCX is
disrupted in the SGC of B. japonicum, where fixA is in an
operon with nifA. In turn, in other SGCs, nifA is commonly
found in an operon with nifB and fdxN. Phylogenetic analyses
of the 20 common genes in the six SGCs result in nonequivalent trees, even for genes that are organized in operons (data
not shown). For example, trees derived from the genes of the
operons nifHDK and fixABCX are incongruent, indicating
that intraoperon recombination has been also frequent.

procedure left 21 hits. From the p42d sequence we extracted
20-bp regions upstream of the start codons of these hits and
inferred the most probable RBS (6 bp in length) by applying
the CONSENSUS program [63]. The resulting consensus matrix supported the sequence GGAGAG with an expected frequency of 2.034 × 10-8.

forward and reverse primers were designed and used to raise
overlapping PCR products with an average size of 5 kb, covering the entire plasmid in a single circular contig. The PCR
products obtained agree well with the determined sequence
(data not shown).

CDS prediction and annotation
The coding capacity of p42d was determined by applying
GLIMMER 2.02 [59,60] iteratively to enhance the overall
prediction efficiency. Given the evidence indicating that
GLIMMER-based predictions are less effective in plasmids
[2], our approach also took into consideration the existence of
several gene classes with different codon-usage (CU) patterns
[61], and a potential ribosome-binding site (RBS) specific to
p42d to aid GLIMMER in the selection of start codons.

RBS prediction
An initial set of presumably functional genes with a corresponding upstream RBS was detected by running BLASTX
[62] comparisons (using a maximum e-value cutoff of 0.001)
of the entire plasmid against the nonredundant (nr) database
[52] at the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI). All matches with hypothetical or putative proteins as
well as those with an upstream neighbor hit closer than 50 bp
were discarded to avoid genes within operons. We took into
consideration only hits displaying an identity ≥ 40%, starting
at the first amino acid, and alignment coverage of at least 80%
of the matched protein. We then extended the selected hits

To train GLIMMER, we took the initial output of the BLASTX
comparison detailed above, and selected as training set all
hits with an alignment length ≥ 100 amino acids. Again, all
matches with hypothetical/putative proteins were discarded.
Overlapping hits matching the same protein were merged
into a single larger hit, generating a total of 183 DNA segments. The RBS and the training set obtained were then used
to run GLIMMER, yielding a prediction of 460 CDSs that included 93% of the 183 segments in the training set. However,
we noticed that running GLIMMER iteratively yielded better
results, because it produced a lower number of predicted
CDSs and a greater number of segments in the training set
mapping within predicted CDSs. We applied the method of
A.M.-S., G.M.-H., A. Christen and J.C.-V. (unpublished work)
to split the initial set of 460 CDSs into three groups displaying
poor, typical and rich codon usage. Essentially, this method
quantifies the extent to which individual genes use the most
abundant codons in the plasmid. Each group was used as a
training set and GLIMMER was run for 20 iterations to predict CDSs ≥ 300 bp (CDSs ≥ 500 bp in the first iteration composed the training set for the second iteration, and so forth).
The best prediction for each CU group was selected, and the
three resulting predictions were incorporated into a single
one that produced 396 CDSs and recovered 97.75% of the initial training set.

Annotation
All CDSs were manually curated using BLASTX comparisons
(e-value ≤ 0.001) against the nr database. The following
criteria were applied to annotate the CDSs: CDSs were tagged
as hypothetical (yh) when no homolog could be detected; hypothetical conserved CDSs (yp) were those displaying strong
similarity to hypothetical proteins or weak similarity to
known genes; CDSs with similarity ≥ 50% along the entire
length of known genes were assigned the same name as the
matching gene; CDSs related to insertion sequences (IS) and
transposons (yi) were compared with BLASTN and BLASTX
against the IS database [64] to identify the family they belong
to. These elements were also analyzed for the presence of inverted repeats at their borders applying OLIGO 6.4 [65] and
BLAST2 programs. Functional classification was carried out
following the categories proposed in Freiberg et al. [10]. Additional support for annotation was obtained by searching for
protein domains and motifs with the Interpro suite [66].
Transmembrane domains and leader peptides were searched
using the PSORT program [67]. A relational database that

Seven putative nod boxes were found by these approaches;
however, several known functional sites were still undetected,
and thus we trained CONSENSUS/PATSER again with the
seven p42d sites found. Given that the mean PATSER score
for these sites is too high (21.48), the usual threshold (µ - 1σ)
is also correspondingly high (16.21), and thus we could not
predict any additional sites. For these reasons, we decided to
use as threshold the lowest PATSER score (9.15) obtained
from the seven training sequences, in this way we finally predicted 15 nod boxes. CONSENSUS/PATSER programs were
also applied to identify regulatory motifs for Fnr based on 30
known binding sites in E. coli extracted from RegulonDB
[79]. Predictions were carried out in the -400 to +50 bp regions using as threshold the PATSER score ≥ 6.2 (µ - 1σ),
which yielded 45 potential Fnr binding sites in p42d. If we get
stricter and use the mean PATSER score (9.77) as threshold,
only eight sites are detected. Nonetheless, given the evidence
suggesting there is high transcriptional activity in the p42d
under low-oxygen conditions [43], we decided to relax the
score to allow more Fnr sites.

Essentially, the method performs BLASTP pairwise comparisons against the protein sequences of p42d, and bidirectional
best hits (BDBHs) were used to define the most likely orthologous genes. All BDBHs with an e-value ≤ 0.0001 and alignment coverage of at least 50% of the smaller CDS were taken
into consideration.

reviews

We predicted that all CDS in p42d are organized in 235 transcription units (TUs) by applying a previously reported distance-based methodology [69]. Binding sites were detected
using upstream regions of variable length (but properly specified in each case) for all annotated CDS in the pSym. To identify genes potentially expressed by RpoN promoters, we
compiled an initial training set containing 85 prokaryotic
promoters for which the transcription start site has been experimentally mapped [38]. The CONSENSUS/PATSER set of
programs [63] was then used to predict promoters 16 bp long
in upstream regions of 250 bp. A final set of 37 RpoN promoters was obtained using as PATSER threshold the mean (µ)
minus one standard deviation (σ) estimated from the set of 85
promoters (µ - 1σ = 6.33). Binding sites for NifA or UAS were
predicted using seven reported sites [27,70–73] as the training set. CONSENSUS/PATSER was run to predict sites of 16
bp in length within -400 to +50 bp regions, yielding 21 sites
with PATSER score ≥ 8.03 (µ - 1σ); if a more stringent threshold is used instead, several known sites are undetected. We
further discarded all predicted UAS without an associated
RpoN promoter. In the case of nod boxes, we applied the
dyad-sweeping method [74] to a set of six reported sites [75–
78] in order to pinpoint the location of potential nod boxes in
the p42d (as a conglomerate of five or more dyads), and then
used CONSENSUS/PATSER to determine 47-bp sites within
-600 to +50 bp regions.
