Abstract
Background: A growing concern has raised regarding the pandemic potential of the highly pathogenic avian
influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop an effective and safe vaccine
against the divergent H5N1 influenza viruses. In the present study, we designed a tetra-branched multiple
antigenic peptide (MAP)-based vaccine, designated M2e-MAP, which contains the sequence overlapping the highly
conserved extracellular domain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) of a HPAI H5N1 virus, and investigated its immune
responses and cross-protection against different clades of H5N1 viruses.
Results: Our results showed that M2e-MAP vaccine induced strong M2e-specific IgG antibody responses following
3-dose immunization of mice with M2e-MAP in the presence of Freunds’ or aluminium (alum) adjuvant. M2e-MAP
vaccination limited viral replication and attenuated histopathological damage in the challenged mouse lungs. The
M2e-MAP-based vaccine protected immunized mice against both clade1: VN/1194 and clade2.3.4: SZ/406H H5N1
virus challenge, being able to counteract weight lost and elevate survival rate following lethal challenge of H5N1
viruses.
Conclusions: These results suggest that M2e-MAP presenting M2e of H5N1 virus has a great potential to be
developed into an effective subunit vaccine for the prevention of infection by a broad spectrum of HPAI H5N1
viruses.

Background
The re-emergence of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian
influenza (HPAI) in 2003 has caused 262 fatal cases
among a total of 442 infected individuals [1]. Therefore,
there is an urgent need to develop safe and effective
antiviral strategies for the prevention of any future pandemic of H5N1 HPAI [2,3], among which vaccination is
still the most effective means to prevent influenza A
virus infection. Due to current vaccine technologies
facing annual problems with vaccine-strain matching,
some conserved antigens of influenza A virus become
promising target for the development of influenza vaccines with broad cross-protection.

In comparison with other surface proteins of H5N1
viruses, matrix protein 2 (M2) is the most conserved.
The native M2 protein exists as a homotetramer formed
by two disulfide linked dimers, with each monomer consisting of 97 amino acids [4,5]. The 24-amino-acid extracellular domain of M2 protein (M2e) is remarkably
conserved across influenza A subtypes [6]. Passively
transferred anti-M2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
accelerated lung viral clearance [7], and mAbs recognizing the N-terminus highly conserved epitope in M2e
protected mice from lethal influenza A virus challenge
[8], implying that M2, in particular M2e, may serve as
an attractive vaccine target. Currently, the rapid evolution of H5N1 virus and the co-circulation of multiple
antigenic variants in multiple regions determine that
development of H5N1 vaccine with cross-protection
against divergent H5N1 viruses would be inevitable.
Although a number of M2e-based vaccines have been

reported to provide broad-spectrum protection against
ordinary human influenza virus infection [9-13], the
cross-protective effect to divergent H5N1 viruses was
undocumented.
In the present study, we designed and synthesized a
tetra-branched multiple antigenic peptide (MAP)
derived from the M2e sequence of H5N1 virus VN/1194
strain, denoted as M2e-MAP, with an aim to develop a
M2e-based vaccine for induction of M2e-specific
immune responses and cross-protection of the vaccinated animals against lethal challenge of divergent
H5N1 virus strains.

Results
M2e-MAP immunization induced potent M2e-specific
antibody responses

To evaluate humoral immune responses potentially
induced by M2e-MAP, mice were vaccinated with 10 μg
of M2e-MAP plus Freund’s or aluminium (alum) adjuvant as described in Methods, and M2e-specific IgG
antibodies were detected in mouse serum samples by
ELISA. As shown in Figure 1, M2e-MAP induced strong
M2e-specific IgG antibody responses, with the highest
titer reaching 1:105 and 1:104 for M2e-MAP+FCA/FIA
and M2e-MAP+alum, respectively, at 10 days post last
boost vaccination. In contrast, only background level of
antibody responses was detected in the mice receiving
adjuvant alone.

M2e-MAP vaccination limited viral replication and
attenuated virus-induced lung pathology

Two phylogenetically distinguished H5N1 virus isolates,
clade1: VN/1194 and clade2.3.4: SZ/406H were selected
to evaluate the protective immunity afforded by M2eMAP vaccine in vivo. Two weeks after the last boost,
mice were challenged with 10 LD50 of H5N1 virus VN/
1194 or SZ/406H. Five days post-challenge, lungs were
removed from infected mice, and infectious virus titers
in the lung tissues were measured to determine the protective effects of M2e-MAP vaccine on viral clearance.
Compared with those from the adjuvant control (FCA/
FIA or alum), the virus titers in the lungs of M2e-MAP
vaccinated mice were significantly lower after H5N1
virus challenge (P < 0.0001) (Figure 2), suggesting that
M2e-MAP vaccine can induce protective immunity
against viral replication in vaccinated mice.
Further examination of the lung tissues of virus-challenged mice revealed dramatic histopathological damage
in the pulmonary airways and parenchymal tissues in
the adjuvant group, including severe damage of bronchial epithelium with necrosis and desquamation, pulmonary vascular dilatation and congestion, infiltration of
prominent number of lymphocytes accompanied by exudates and severe edema, especially around vessels, as
well as broadening interstitial spaces or fused alveoli
walls with focal hemorrhage (Figure 3A). In contrast,
lungs of M2e-MAP-vaccinated mice exhibited less

Figure 1 M2e-specific antibody responses induced by M2e-MAP vaccine. Mice were vaccinated with M2e-MAP plus FCA/FIA (s.c.) or alum (i.
m.) adjuvant for a total of 3 times. Mice receiving FCA/FIA or alum alone were served as adjuvant controls. Mouse sera were collected preimmunization and 10 days post-each immunization for detection of M2e-specific antibodies by ELISA. The end-point titer of each sample was
determined as the highest dilution that yielded an OD450 nm value greater than twice that of similarly diluted serum sample collected prevaccination. The data are expressed as geometric mean titer (GMT) ± standard deviation (SD) of 10 mice per group. The lower limit detection
(1:10) is indicated by a dotted line. Experiments were repeated three times.

Figure 2 Virus titers in challenged mouse lungs. Two weeks post-last boost, mice were challenged with 10LD50 of H5N1 virus, clade1: VN/
1194 (A.) or clade2.3.4: SZ/406H (B.), and lungs were collected for detection of virus titer five days later. The data are expressed as Log10TCID50/g
of lung tissues. The lower limit of detection is 1.5 Log10TCID50/g of tissues as indicated by a dotted line. The data are presented as GMT ± SD of

histopathological changes, accompanied by only mild
pulmonary interstitial pneumonia and moderate lymphocytic infiltration (Figure 3B). The above data implied
that M2e-MAP vaccination may protect the mice against
lethal challenge of divergent H5N1 viruses through a
combination of limiting viral replication in the lungs
and attenuating virus-induced lung pathology.
M2e-MAP vaccination elicited cross-protection against
lethal challenge of divergent H5N1 viruses

After receiving the lethal dose (10 LD50) of two H5N1
virus strains, the M2e-MAP vaccinated mice were
further evaluated in terms of cross-protective ability by
daily observation of the clinical symptoms, including
weight loss and survival rate for two weeks, and then
histopathological examination following removal of lung
tissues.
From day 4 after VN/1194 and day 3 after SZ/406H
virus infection, the adjuvant control mice (FCA/FIA or
alum) developed obvious clinical signs, including ruffled
fur, hunched posture, rapid breathing, inactivity and
paralysis of posterior limb. These clinical signs were
either not observed or were delayed for 2-3 days in the
M2e-MAP vaccination group. Most M2e-MAP vaccinated mice with clinical signs only exhibited slight or
partial piloerection for 2-3 days and then recovered.
Moreover, compared to the adjuvant control, M2e-MAP
vaccinated mice that did not survive the challenges were

observed to have delayed the onset of illness and longer
survival days. The observed protection against clinical
signs correlated with the changes in body weight. In the
adjuvant group, body weight dramatically decreased and
even reached a near 25% severe weight loss after H5N1
virus infection. In contrast, the average body weight in
the M2e-MAP vaccination group only slightly decreased
(less than 10%) during 6-10 days after challenge and
then steadily increased (Figure 4A).
All control mice receiving FCA/FIA or alum adjuvant
alone died from virus challenge, while 70% to 80% of
the mice vaccinated with M2e-MAP survived the lethal
H5N1 virus challenge (Figure 4B), with significantly
increased survival rate (P < 0.0001). At 14 days postchallenge, lung tissues from surviving mice were
removed to evaluate viral replication and histopathological damage. No H5N1 virus was detected in the lungs of
surviving mice, and the lung tissues of these mice presented almost normal structures (data not shown). The
above data confirmed that M2e-MAP vaccine can afford
cross-protection against lethal challenge of divergent
H5N1 viruses.

Discussion
A cross-protective vaccine for antigenic variants of
H5N1 virus is a very important component in prophylactic strategy against a possible human pandemic.

after virus challenge. The figure indicates the representative images of histopathological damage from H&E-stained lungs of mice vaccinated

Although the highly conservative M2e of influenza A
virus is one of the most promising target for development of universal influenza vaccines, some strategies
would be required to improve immunogenicity of vaccines based on M2e containing only 24 amino acid.
The high molar ratio and dense packing of multiple
copies of a target antigen in MAP system have been
shown to stimulate better immune responses than single-chain peptides [14-16]. Mozdzanowska et al. [17]
reported that MAP system presenting human influenza
M2e sequence was an effective immunogen, with antiM2e IgG antibodies from mice immunized with M2eMAP binding specifically to M2-expressing cells. However, it is unclear whether M2e-MAP could be used as a
vaccine candidate to provide effective protection against
HPAI H5N1 virus. Different from human influenza A
viruses of H1, H2 or H3, H5N1 viruses have circulated
only in domestic and wild birds so far [18-21]. The
H5N1 viruses leading to human infections still belong to
the avian type [22]. M2e vaccine designed on sequences
of human influenza virus H1, H2 or H3 subtype may
not provide the same protection against H5N1 virus
leading to human infections [11]. Moreover, the 10-20
amino acid region of M2e was consistent with host
restriction specificities [23].
In this study, we designed M2e-MAP in tetrabranched form containing 4 copies of sequence overlapping M2e of VN/1194, a HPAI H5N1 strain (Figure 5).
High titers of M2e-specific antibody responses could be
induced following immunization of M2e-MAP plus
Freund’s adjuvant, a commonly used adjuvant in animal

experiments or alum, a common adjuvant for human
vaccines (Figure 1). Although it has been shown that
M2e-specific IgG antibodies do not exhibit an ability to
directly neutralize virus in vitro, the antiviral effect of
M2e-based vaccines was mediated by antibodies to M2e
antigen. The mechanism of such antibody mediated
antiviral effect could be due to antibody-dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or complementmediated cytotoxicity (CDC) [24,25]. Therefore, the
induction of M2e-specific antibody responses was necessary for M2e-based vaccines in the prevention of H5N1
virus infection.
Strikingly, M2e-MAP vaccination with Freund’s and
alum adjuvants conferred cross-protection against a
lethal challenge with not only the homologous strain,
VN/1194 in clade1, but also a divergent strain, SZ/406H
in clade2.3.4. M2e-MAP vaccination in mice delayed the
onset of illness, prolonged survival, alleviated body
weight loss, limited viral replication and restricted histopathological damage in lung tissues (Figure 2, Figure 3
and Figure 4). The clade categorization of the VN/1194
and SZ/406H strains was based on the phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene. The clade2.3.4 viruses seem to
have been prevalent in China since late 2005 and were
also responsible for human infection in Laos, Malaysia
and Vietnam [26,27], which included A/Hunan/2/2009,
one of the most recent human isolates from China [28].
Compared with the monomeric M2e peptide-based
vaccines, M2e-MAP vaccine could induce stronger protective immunity due to the immune enhancing effect of
the T-helper epitope in the vaccine [14]. In terms of the

safety, the synthetic peptide-based M2e-MAP vaccine is
superior to the DNA-, adenoviral vector-, and recombinant protein-based M2 vaccines. For example, DNA vaccines have the potential to integrate the viral genomes
into human DNA, to develop autoimmunity, and to
induce antibiotic resistance [29]. The recombinant protein-based vaccine may have contamination of endotoxin and other unwanted antigens from cell cultures
[30]. In spite of a relatively higher cost of production,
synthetic peptide-based vaccine can be rapidly designed
and synthesized and more convenient for storage and
transportation, making M2e-MAP vaccine a better
choice for speed development of effective and safe vaccines to combat emerging influenza pandemic.
Based on the evidence of our findings, the approach of
developing M2e-based vaccines with broad cross-protection is feasible. Some strategies, such as incorporation of
appropriate adjuvants into the present MAP system,
modification of the present M2e consensus sequences of
H5N1 viruses as vaccine target, and/or selection of
other M2e expression forms, might be helpful to achieve

full cross-protection against lethal H5N1 virus infection.
The effects of such approaches need to be determined
in further studies. The data reported here support the
concept of developing an M2e-based vaccine candidate
that could provide cross-protection against divergent
HPAI H5N1 viruses. Such vaccine based on the highly
conserved target antigen of H5N1 viruses might be used
in combination with current H5N1 influenza vaccines to
enhance protection and to prevent a possible future
human pandemic of H5N1 influenza.

Conclusions
In the present study, we synthesized tetra-branched
M2e-MAP based on the M2e sequence of H5N1 virus.
The M2e-MAP vaccine induced strong M2e-specific
IgG antibody responses, being able to protect mice
against lethal challenge of both clade1: VN/1194 and
clade2.3.4: SZ/406H H5N1 viruses. Based on the evidence of our findings, the approach of developing M2ebased vaccine with broad cross-protection is feasible.
The data reported here support the concept of

developing an M2e-based vaccine that could provide
cross-protection against divergent HPAI H5N1 viruses.

Methods
Tetra-branched M2e multiple antigenic peptide (M2eMAP)

Tetra-branched M2e-MAP carrying four copies of M2e
peptide of H5N1 virus strain VN/1194 was synthesized
on [Fmoc-Lys(Fmoc)]2-Lys-Cys(Acm)-bAla-Wang Resin
(Advanced ChemTech, Louisville, Kentuchy, USA) on a
0.02 mM scale using an Applied Biosystems model
433A peptide synthesizer. Cleavage of the peptide from
the resin was performed by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), DTT, water, and triisopropylsila (TIPS)
in the ratio 88:5:5:2 (TFA/DTT/H2O/TIPS). Crude peptide was purified by reversed phase high-performance
liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The purified peptide
was characterized by amino acid analysis and matrixassisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry
(MALDI-MS). Figure 5 shows the composition and
sequence of M2e-MAP.
Mice

Female BALB/c mice at 4-6 weeks were purchased from
the Laboratory Animal Unit and housed in the animal
facility of The University of Hong Kong following the
approved animal care protocols. Mice were rested for 2
weeks before immunization. The animal study was
approved by the Department of Health of Government
of Hong Kong Special Administration Region, and University Animal Ethics Committee of The University of
Hong Kong.
Viruses

HPAI H5N1 virus isolates used in this study were
clade1: VN/1194 and clade2.3.4: SZ/406H. H5N1 viruses
were grown in the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old
embryonated chicken eggs. Virus-containing allantoic
fluid was harvested and stored in aliquots at -80°C until

use. The LD 50 of each virus stain was determined in
mice after serial dilutions of the virus stock. All infectious experiments related to H5N1 viruses were performed in an approved biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility
at The University of Hong Kong.
Animal experiment

Mice were subcutaneously (s.c.) prime vaccinated with
M2e-MAP (10 μg/mouse) plus Freund’s complete adjuvant (FCA, sigma) and boosted twice with the same
amount of immunogen plus Freund’s incomplete adjuvant (FIA, Sigma) at 3-week intervals. For parallel
experiments, mice were also intramuscularly (i.m.) vaccinated with the same amount of M2e-MAP immunogens
plus alum adjuvant (Sigma) at the same condition of the
above. Mice injected with Freund’s or alum adjuvant
were used as the respective control. Mouse sera were
collected before immunization and 10 days post-each
vaccination for detection of antibody responses.
Two weeks post-last vaccination, mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine (75/5
mg/kg), and intranasally (i.n.) challenged with 10LD50 of
clade1: VN/1194 or clade2.3.4: SZ/406H H5N1 virus
stain. Infected mice were observed and weighed daily for
2 weeks. Lung tissues were collected from euthanized
mice 5 days post-challenge for further virological test
and histopathological analysis.
ELISA

The M2-specific IgG antibody in the vaccinated mouse
sera was detected by ELISA as previously described [31]
with some modifications. Briefly, 96-well microtiter
plates were pre-coated with 5 μg/ml of M2e-MAP overnight at 4°C. After blocking with 3% BSA containing
0.05% Tween-20 in PBS, serial diluted mouse sera were
added to the plates, followed by adding HRP-conjugated
rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:2,000, Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) for 1 h at 37°C. Assay was developed using 3,3’,5,5’tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Zymed, Carlsbad, CA),

Figure 5 Construction and sequence of M2e-MAP. The final form of M2e-MAP was synthesized on [Fmoc-Lys(Fmoc)]2-Lys-Cys(Acm)-bAlaWang Resin in tetra-branched form, which carries four copies of M2e peptide. The sequence of M2e from highly pathogenic avian influenza
H5N1 virus VN/1194 strain is shown at the bottom.

and the reaction was stopped by adding 1N H2SO4. The
absorbance at 450 nm was measured by an ELISA plate

Virus titers in lung tissues

Lung tissues from euthanized mice were aseptically
removed and homogenized in minimal essential medium
(MEM) plus antibiotics to achieve 10% (w/v) suspensions of lungs. Ten-fold serial dilutions of samples were
added in quadruplicate to the monolayer of MadinDarby canine kidney (MDCK) cells seeded at 96-well
cell culture plates 12 h before infection, and allowed to
absorb for 2 h at 37°C. Fresh medium was then added
to the cells and continued to incubate for 72 h. Virus
cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed daily and the viral
titer was determined by the hemagglutinin (HA) test
indicated as follows. Fifty microlitre of 0.5% turkey red
blood cells (Lampire Biological Laboratories, Pipersville,
PA) was added to 50 μl of cell culture supernatant and
incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Wells containing HA were scored as positive. The virus titer was
calculated by the Reed and Muench method and
expressed as Log10TCID50/g of lung tissues.
Histopathological analysis

The lung tissues of challenged mice were immediately
fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in
paraffin wax. Sections were made at 4-6 μm thickness
and mounted on slides. Histopathological changes were
examined by H&E staining and observed under light
microscopy as previously described [32].
Statistical analysis

The significance between survival curves was analyzed
by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with log-rank test.
Other data were analyzed using the 2-tailed Student’s t
test. P < 0.0001 was considered significant. All analyses
were performed in Graphpad Prism software.
