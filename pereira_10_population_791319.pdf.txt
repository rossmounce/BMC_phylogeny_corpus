Abstract
Background: The archaeology of North Africa remains enigmatic, with questions of population continuity versus
discontinuity taking centre-stage. Debates have focused on population transitions between the bearers of the
Middle Palaeolithic Aterian industry and the later Upper Palaeolithic populations of the Maghreb, as well as
between the late Pleistocene and Holocene.
Results: Improved resolution of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup U6 phylogeny, by the screening of
39 new complete sequences, has enabled us to infer a signal of moderate population expansion using Bayesian
coalescent methods. To ascertain the time for this expansion, we applied both a mutation rate accounting for
purifying selection and one with an internal calibration based on four approximate archaeological dates: the
settlement of the Canary Islands, the settlement of Sardinia and its internal population re-expansion, and the split
between haplogroups U5 and U6 around the time of the first modern human settlement of the Near East.
Conclusions: A Bayesian skyline plot placed the main expansion in the time frame of the Late Pleistocene, around
20 ka, and spatial smoothing techniques suggested that the most probable geographic region for this
demographic event was to the west of North Africa. A comparison with U6’s European sister clade, U5, revealed a
stronger population expansion at around this time in Europe. Also in contrast with U5, a weak signal of a recent
population expansion in the last 5,000 years was observed in North Africa, pointing to a moderate impact of the
late Neolithic on the local population size of the southern Mediterranean coast.

Background
Despite much recent research, the archaeology of North
Africa remains enigmatic, with questions of population
continuity versus discontinuity taking centre-stage. Key
issues concern the identity of the bearers of the Middle
Palaeolithic (or Middle Stone Age) Aterian industry (the
age of which has recently risen dramatically from ~4020,000 years ago (ka) to ≥115-40 ka [1,2]), and whether
or not there was continuity between these and the later
Upper Palaeolithic populations of the Maghreb. This
question has become more urgent with the discovery
that the Aterian is associated in Northwest Africa with a
very early appearance of evidence for behavioural

modernity, such as perforated Nassarius shell beads, use
of ochre and bone tools, and long-distance exchange
networks - preceding those of southern Africa and making it likely that the Aterian was carried by anatomically
modern (rather than archaic) humans [3]. The fate of
the populations using this industry, and their possible
connection with others in Africa and with the group
who dispersed out of Africa ~60 ka to populate the rest
of the world, has naturally become a question of great
interest.
Further debates have focused on the question of population replacement in the late Pleistocene and Holocene.
The earliest Upper Palaeolithic industry in North Africa
is the Dabban, limited to Cyrenaïca (a likely glacial
refuge area [4]) and most likely dating from ~36-50 ka
to ~20 ka [5]. Its similarities to Near Eastern Early
Upper Palaeolithic industries have suggested an origin

in the Levant [5], rather than locally in the Aterian, and
similar blade industries have been found further south
by 30 ka [1]. The Dabban was replaced by the Eastern
Oranian (or Eastern Iberomaurusian) in Cyrenaïca possibly as early as ~18 ka [1], by which time the Upper
Palaeolithic had extended eastwards for the first time
along the coastal belt of the Maghreb, with the Iberomaurusian (or Oranian), the origins of which are similarly controversial, especially as it appears earliest in the
Northwest. It began at the Last Glacial Maximum
(LGM), ~22-20 ka, with a period of intensification in
the Late Glacial ~15-13 ka, although recent work suggests a possible underlying industry as early as ~26 ka
[1,6]. Similar debates concerning continuity versus replacement surround discussion of the widespread EpiPalaeolithic Capsian industries, which saw expansion
southwards from eastern Algeria into an increasingly
humid Sahara in the early Holocene and sometimes
associated with more gracile Mediterranean skeletal
remains, and the subsequent emergence of the Neolithic
[4,7-10].
The phylogeographic analysis of human mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA) has the potential to address questions
such as these [11]. In particular, the mtDNA haplogroup
U6 has a unique and highly distinctive distribution
amongst human mitochondrial DNA lineages. It is
found primarily in North Africa and the Canary Islands
(albeit with secondary dispersals into Iberia and East
Africa), with its highest frequency amongst Algerian
Berbers (28%), and it has therefore been proposed to be
linked to the ancestors of the indigenous Berber-speaking populations of North Africa [12-15]. Macaulay et al.
[15] described U6 and its sister clade U5 as having
evolved from a common ancestor in the Near East,
approximately 50 ka; while U5 spread along the northern Mediterranean coast with the European Early Upper
Palaeolithic, U6 dispersed along the southern coast, as
far as Cyrenaïca, alongside the Dabban industry, ~40-50
ka, with a further expansion into Northwest Africa with
the Iberomaurusian culture, ~22 ka. On this view, U6
evolved en route or within North Africa (as U5 evolved
within Europe [11]), the presence of occasional derived
U6 lineages in the Near East would signal more recent
gene flow from North Africa [16].
These early studies were based only on information
from hypervariable region I (HV-I) in the mtDNA control region and a small number of diagnostic RFLPs in
the coding region, assayed in samples from several
populations of North Africa and Iberia. In most of these
regions, U6 frequencies are ~10% or less [17], and even
appear absent from some Berber communities in Tunisia [18,19]. The major sub-haplogroup U6a (characterized by control-region transitions from the ancestor of
haplogroup U at nucleotide positions 16172, 16219 and

Page 2 of 10

16278) is highly dispersed, occurring throughout North
Africa (and at low levels in the Near East and Iberia),
and a further nested subclade, U6a1 (characterized by
an additional transition at position 16189), follows a
similar distribution.
By contrast, U6b (characterized by variants at 1617216219-16311) has a more limited range to the northwest
of North Africa, the north of the Iberian Peninsula and,
as a nested derivative (U6b1, characterized by a transition at position 16163), in the Canary Islands [13]. In
particular, the U6b1 lineage in the Canary Islands has
been considered a founder lineage for the colonization
of this archipelago by the Guanches (culturally very
similar to Northwest Africans), ~2-3 ka [13], a conclusion supported by studies of ancient DNA [20]. Hence
its arrival suggests itself as a potentially useful calibration point for the mtDNA molecular clock, although the
archaeological evidence for the colonisation time is
rather insubstantial [21]. In fact, the absence of U6b1
lineages anywhere outside of the Canary Islands (the
few exceptions detected in Spain and in Americas being
most readily explained as recent migrants from there),
and the failure to detect immediate ancestors in North
Africa, seem to point to the emergence of this clade
within the Canary Islands - although probably soon
after their colonization, as it is observed across several
islands.
Maca-Meyer et al. [22] performed the first study of
complete U6 mtDNA sequences (with 14 samples),
defining a new U6 sub-haplogroup, U6c (characterized
by the HV-I transition motif 16169-16172-16189), which
was even more geographically restricted than U6b - limited to the west of North Africa and, as a derivative
(U6c1, with an additional 16129 substitution), in the
Canary archipelago. Using coding-region age estimates
as maximum limits for radiation times, they proposed
that the proto-U6 spread from the Near East to North
Africa ~30 ka, alongside the Iberomaurusian industry,
with U6a reflecting an African re-expansion from the
Maghreb eastwards in Palaeolithic times, and U6a1 a
further reverse movement from East Africa back to the
Maghreb, possibly coinciding with the probable Afroasiatic linguistic expansion. The clades U6b and U6c,
restricted to West Africa, had more localized expansions; they argued that U6b reached Iberia at the time
of the diffusion of the Capsian culture in North Africa.
However, a larger study by Olivieri et al. [23] was closer to the earlier interpretation of Macaulay et al. [15].
They confirmed the origin of U6, or at least that of its
immediate ancestor, in southwest Asia, with an ancient
introduction (alongside haplogroup M1, and the Dabban
industry) to North Africa via the Levant, possibly during
the Greenland Interstadial 12, from ~44-48 ka. They
reaffirmed that the various U6 sub-groups originated in

Pereira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:390
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/390

the southern Mediterranean area, dispersing subsequently to East Africa.
Coalescence time estimates for U6 and it subclades
have varied considerably amongst these studies. Yet
these are critical for studies of prehistoric dispersals,
since reliable estimates can bracket the timing of demographically significant events. For example, a regionallyspecific clade may have arisen from a migration event
on the edge in the tree leading to that clade, and if the
diversification has then arisen in situ rather than prior
to the presumed founder event, the estimate of the time
to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) can
provide a minimum bound on the age of the migration
event (motivating the “founder analysis” [24]). However,
success rests on a number of requirements, principally
that the phylogeny can be well-estimated and the molecular clock that converts genetic differences into time
depth is well-calibrated [25]. Considerable progress has
recently been made on both of these fronts by more
sophisticated analyses of the richer data source provided
by mtDNA complete sequences.
With respect to the molecular clock, there are many
factors leading to uncertainty. There is the wide variation in positional mutation rates and violations of the
independence of mutations at different positions.
Obvious regions are the paired stems of rRNAs and
tRNAs [26], which some authors remove from the analysis [27], but there are other locations in the mtDNA
molecule which can also present a secondary structure
related with a functional role [28]. There is the problem
of multiple hits and saturation, leading to the curious
observation that the total proportion of control-region
polymorphisms in the African branches of the tree is
lower than in the non-African ones. Selection is also an
important issue, with a higher frequency of replacement
substitutions in the younger branches of the human
mtDNA phylogeny compared to the more internal
branches [29-31]. Kivisild et al. [30] advocated the use
of only synonymous diversity for estimation of the
TMRCA, which is problematic for age estimations in
young lineages, while Soares et al. [31] implemented a
correction for the purifying selection effect on the mutation rate estimated for the entire molecule.
The choice of calibration points is also an important
issue. Traditionally, an outgroup is used, where the split
time with the human lineage can be assigned in some
way. For humans, the closest one is that corresponding
to the human-chimpanzee split, for which the fossil evidence is controversial and which is in a time frame very
distant from the TMRCA of the mtDNA of Homo
sapiens, rendering the application of a strict clock problematic [32]. One recent analysis additionally used the
chronometric ages of the available Neanderthal
sequences as calibration points [33]. A strategy of

Page 3 of 10

multiple calibration points in conjunction with relaxedclock methods, where the rate is allowed to vary among
branches in the tree [34] is appealing, but this has been
hard to implement in the human tree because of unavailability of secure multiple calibration points. Bandelt
et al. [25] advocate that calibrated radiocarbon dates in
favourable pioneer-settlement situations with a welldefined founder mtDNA scenario and a rich archaeological record could be used for calibration purposes, but
consensus for both radiocarbon dates and founder
mtDNA lineages are far from being achieved in most
known settlement situations. Endicott and Ho [27]
applied an internal calibration to the human mtDNA
tree by specifying priors on the ages of three nodes in
the tree associated with demographic signals: the entry
into Australia and New Guinea by establishing a minimum of 40 ka for haplogroup P; and the post-Last Glacial Maximum expansion of haplogroups H1 and H3
(unfortunately suggested as 18 ka). This internal calibration was performed using a Bayesian approach with the
software BEAST [35], and resulted in a substitution rate
1.4 times higher than that resulting from the humanchimpanzee calibration. BEAST also, however, allows a
reconstruction of effective population size through time,
by using the Bayesian skyline plot (BSP [36]), based on a
coalescent model analysed by Markov Chain Monte
Carlo sampling. BSPs do not require a pre-specified
parametric growth model as do other methods and,
although designed for use with population data, they
have also been used to attempt parameter estimation
from haplogroup data with some apparent success [37].
Here, we analyse an additional 39 complete U6 genomes, from the full range of the U6 geographic distribution, including the Near East, Iberia and the Canary
Islands. This has enabled us to construct a phylogenetic
tree including 89 U6 genomes in total, and to re-evaluate the demographic history of the haplogroup, and its
role in North African prehistory, in the light of the
recent developments in the calibration of mutation
rates. A comparison tree was inferred for 141 U5
sequences from the literature, allowing us to test the
use of four alternative internal calibration points (the
settlement of the Canary Islands, the settlement of Sardinia and its internal population re-expansion, and the
split between haplogroups U5 and U6 around the time
of the first modern human settlement of the Near East)
against the recently developed complete genome clock
with a correction for purifying selection.

Methods
Samples

Based on information from HV-I that allowed the general classification into haplogroups, we selected 39 U6
individuals for complete sequencing: 22 from Portugal,

Pereira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:390

most of them included in a published Portuguese database [38] and some new data; 5 from the Canary
Islands; 1 from Morocco; 2 from a sample of 583 Ashkenazi Jews (of Polish and Russian ancestry [39]), 7
from 1143 non-Ashkenazi Jews (of Turkish, Bulgarian,
Moroccan, Tunisian, and Ethiopian ancestry), and 2
from 253 Near Eastern Palestinians. Except in the case
of the Canary Islands dataset, where we selected 5 U6b1
samples randomly, all the available U6 samples were
sequenced from each of these datasets. The samples
belonged to unrelated individuals, who gave informed
consent for their biological samples to be used for
mtDNA characterisation. The work complied with the
Helsinki Declaration of Ethical Principles (59 th WMA
General Assembly, Seoul, October 2008) and was
approved by IPATIMUP Ethics Commission.
Complete mtDNA sequencing and nomenclature

We amplified mtDNA using 32 overlapping fragments
as described elsewhere [40]. After purification, we used
the forward primers for the sequencing, and in some
cases, also the reverse primers (in the presence of polycytosine stretches, when polymorphisms A574C and
T16189C occur). We performed sequencing on a 3100
DNA Analyzer (AB Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA), and the resulting sequences were read with SeqScape (AB Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and
BioEdit version 7.0.4.1 [41], by two independent investigators. In cases of ambiguous base calls, the PCR and
sequencing reactions were repeated. Furthermore, the
protocols for rechecking both haplogroup-defining polymorphisms, previously well-established in the literature,
as well as private mutations were followed [42]. Mutations were scored relative to the revised reference
sequence, rCRS [43], and numbers 1-16569 refer to the
position of the mutation in that sequence. The 39 complete mtDNA sequences have been deposited in GenBank (Accession Numbers HQ651676-HQ651714).
Statistical analyses

For the U6 phylogeny reconstruction, besides the new
39 sequences obtained here, we used 50 complete
sequences previously published [22,23,40,44-47], and
some unpublished sequences deposited in GenBank
from the Family Tree DNA Company (accession numbers provided in Additional File 1). We also inferred a
U5 tree, from 141 complete sequences available in GenBank and listed in Additional File 1. Preliminary network analyses [48] led to a suggested branching order
for the trees, which we then constructed most parsimoniously by hand. The software mtDNA-GeneSyn [26]
was used to convert files.
For estimation of the TMRCA for specific clades in
the phylogeny, we used r statistic frequentist, maximum

Page 4 of 10

likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. We used
the r statistic (mean sequence divergence from the
inferred ancestral haplotype of the clade in question)
with a mutation rate estimate for the complete mtDNA
sequence of one transition in every 3,624 years [31], correcting for purifying selection by using the calculator
provided with that paper. We estimated standard errors
as in Saillard et al. [49]. We also obtained maximum
likelihood (ML) estimates of branch lengths using
PAML 3.13 [50], assuming the HKY85 mutation model
with gamma-distributed rates (approximated by a discrete distribution with 32 categories). We converted
mutational distance in ML to time using the same
clock. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were performed
using BEAST 1.4.6 [35] with a relaxed molecular clock
(lognormal in distribution across branches and uncorrelated between them) and the HKY model of mutation
with gamma-distributed rates. For this analysis, we performed an independent mutation rate calibration using
calibration points internal to the phylogeny, which could
be associated with particular demographic events, as
suggested before [27,32]. The four chosen calibration
points were selected to be within the time scale of interest to this study. The dates of three of the calibration
points were assigned a shifted exponential distribution
in which the most recent age (indeed, the mode) for the
given clade as well as the 95th percentile were assigned.
- For the first point, we assigned a mode age of 45
ka and a 95 th percentile of 60 ka for the split
between the U5 and U6 lineages, based on the
hypothesis that some of the first settlers of Europe
[51] were carrying haplogroup U that would later
evolve into U5 [11]. Considering this, the age of the
U5-U6 split would be a minimum of 45 ka old. Reliable archaeological dates are minimum estimates of
a first settlement, justifying the use of the exponential distribution.
- The second calibration point with mode 2.3 ka and
95th percentile 5 ka was the age of the U6b1 branch
based on the archaeological date for the colonization
of the Canary Islands. The first settlement of the
Canary Islands is extremely uncertain and the
archaeology of the islands is not extensive [21].
Furthermore, the fact that U6b is so uncommon in
North Africa could mean that the populations that
carried U6b into the Canary Islands disappeared by
drift and U6b1 already existed outside the Canaries.
Again an exponential distribution was used to capture this uncertainty.
- The third point with mode 8 ka and 95th percentile
14 ka was within U5b3a1, a subclade of which,
U5b3a1a, is found only on Sardinia [52]. Sardinia
was permanently colonized at least 8 ka [53].

Pereira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:390
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/390

The colonization time most probably took place
between the radiation of the Sardinian-specific
branch (U5b3a1a) and its split point with mainland
Europe (U5b3a1), indicating that the latter is necessarily higher than 8 ka [52]. Again the age of the
clade may be substantially higher than 8 ka and
therefore an exponential distribution was used.
- The fourth calibration point we used was an age
estimate for the Sardinian U5b3a1a branch, assigned
a normal distribution (truncated at zero) centred on
5.8 ka, with a standard deviation of 1,000 years.
After the settlement of Sardinia, the population size
was probably low (considering the long branch
between U5b3a1 and the ancestor of U5b3a1a). It is
tempting to identify the subsequent rather star-like
radiation of U5b3a1a with a population expansion.
The late Neolithic in Sardinia around 5-6 ka was a
likely time of internal re-expansion and population
increase [53] and we hypothesized that the age of
U5b3a1a corresponds to this internal expansion.
This interpretation gains strength from a signal elsewhere in the phylogeny: haplogroup M1 in Sardinia
also presents a rather star-like clade [23] dating to
5.2 ka, based on r and the time-dependent clock.
BEAST uses a Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC)
approach to sample from the posterior distributions of
model parameters (branching times in the tree and substitution rates). Specifically, we ran 150,000,000 iterations, with samples drawn every 1,000 MCMC steps,
after a discarded burn-in of 15,000,000 steps. We
checked for convergence to the stationary distribution
and sufficient sampling by inspection of posterior samples. We also obtained Bayesian skyline plots from
BEAST and visualised them with Tracer v1.3 from posterior distributions of parameters run for 50,000,000
iterations (with samples drawn every 1,000 MCMC
steps, after a discarded burn-in of 5,000,000 steps). We
used a generation time of 25 years to rescale the vertical
axis of the BSP to years. In addition, we forced the larger sub-haplogroups (U6abd, U6a, U6bd, U6b, U6c and
U6d) to be monophyletic in the analysis, as the presence
of fast-evolving positions (such as 16189 and 16311)
leads to the reconstruction of diverse phylogenies, which
would not be comparable with the one inferred using
network analysis; MCMC updates which violated this
assumption were immediately rejected.
To determine and visualise the geographical distribution of U6, U6a and U6bd, we constructed interpolation
maps using the “Spatial Analyst Extension” of ArcView
version 3.2 http://www.esri.com/software/arcview/. We
used the “Inverse Distance Weighted” (IDW) option
with a power of two for the interpolation of the surface.
IDW assumes that each input point has a local influence

Page 5 of 10

that decreases with distance. The geographic location
used is the centre of the distribution area from which
the individual samples of each population were collected. The data used are listed in Additional File 1.

Results and Discussion
The enlarged U6 phylogeny (Additional File 2) confirmed the principal sub-groups already identified [23],
and did not reveal any novel ones. It highlights, however, that variation in HV-I can be misleading in regard
to the branching structure, particularly when major
splits in the phylogeny are supported only by mutations
at hotspot positions, justifying Olivieri et al.’s caution in
the naming of such clusters (their Fig. three). For example, the additional data now allows transitions at position 16189 in U6 to now be resolved into several events
[23], showing that the old classification of “U6a1” based
only on HV-I diversity [20], and unifying U6a1 with
U6a2 and U6a3 in Olivieri et al. [23] is not reliable. The
case for the postulated “U6a1” movement from East
Africa back to the Maghreb advanced by Maca-Meyer
et al. [20] is not favoured by our inferred phylogeny, as
the 16189 transition does not identify non-monophyletic
groups. Indeed, the only sub-clade which seems to have
a preferred distribution in East Africa (three individuals
from Ethiopia) falls within U6a2, with only codingregion diagnostic mutations at positions 6359 and 11204
(dating to 13.4 ± 4.0 ka).
We display the geographic distribution of the frequencies of U6 and its major sub-clades across Europe,
North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and the Near East
using HV-I data. Figure 1 confirms that U6a occurs
most frequently in the west of North Africa, with two
main peaks in Mauritania and Mozabites, most probably
due to genetic drift, which is especially strong in the latter. U6bd (mostly likely U6b, since U6 d is very rare
and cannot be distinguished from U6b on the basis of
HV-I diversity) is restricted to the Canary Islands and to
a few instances in North Iberia.
The estimated ages for the various U6 groups (Table
1) obtained using the internal calibration points have a
mean ratio of 0.92 (for r) and 0.95 (for ML) relative to
dates using the Soares et al. [31] mutation rate, corrected for purifying selection. Most of the major U6
subclades coalesce at times between the Last Glacial
Maximum and the early Holocene, and the age of U6 as
a whole is ~37 ka, but with a large 95% confidence
range encompassing roughly 25-50 ka, due to the small
number of early branching events.
The posterior medians and 95% intervals for the ages
of the points used for calibration were: for the U5-U6
split, 46,222 years [45,000-50,293]; U5b3a1, 9,825 years
[8,000-12,714]; U5b3a1a, 5,850 years [4,953-6,743]; and
U6b1, 4,835 years [2,958-7,064]. The posterior

distributions for the oldest points agree better with the
prior dates than the youngest point of U6b1, indicating
that the Bayesian estimates will readapt the priors
according to the existing information in the tree. This is
most obvious in the case of the age of U6b1, suggesting
that either the first settlement of the Canary Archipelago was earlier than the (admittedly weak) existing
archaeological evidence indicates [21] or that U6b1 had
already arisen prior to colonisation and has since drifted
to extinction in the northwest African source, or at least
has yet to be sampled. The estimates using the rate of
Soares et al. [31] are both somewhat younger, suggesting
that the Bayesian calibration (with only one calibration
point in this range) may be failing to correct adequately
for purifying selection at this time depth.
It is also worth pointing out that the age of haplogroup U reported here (the U5-U6 split at around 46
ka) is slightly lower than the age of U reported recently
using r and ML and the complete sequence clock corrected for purifying selection [11,31] which tended to be
> 50 ka. In fact, a r estimate of 44,145 years [32,46056,254] is obtained using only the U5-U6 data with the

Soares et al. rate; so the age of U in the Bayesian analysis would most probably have been higher if all the subbranches of U had been included. The ages of U5b3a1
and U5b3a1a were 11,912 [3,456-20,777] years and
4,128 years [2,016-6,269] respectively. The comparison
of the posterior mean for the ages in Bayesian with the
r estimates for the four points indicate a mean ratio of
1.1 higher in the Bayesian analysis, in contrast to the
trend obtained in the U6 ages described above. The
Bayesian and r estimates overlap.
A further check of the clock is the age of U5a2a [54],
since a single HV-I sequence belonging to this clade has
been obtained from an ancient skeletal sample dated by
radiocarbon to 7.8 ka [55]. The date obtained for U5a2a
with the internal calibration was 8,045 years [4,39113,184], concordant with the minimum possible age of
the clade.
The BSPs (Figure 2) computed for the U6 and U5
haplogroups (based on the mutation rate obtained with
the internal calibration) display quite interesting patterns. One must keep in mind that BSPs were developed
to estimate (effective) population size through time from

a random sample of sequences [56], and there is little
doubt that haplogroups do not equate to physically
separated populations. Even so, the signs of expansions
displayed in the U5 and U6 phylogenies may reflect
expansions of populations bearing these haplogroups (as
well as others), located in Europe and North Africa,
respectively (compare the approach of Atkinson et al.
[37] in sub-Saharan Africa). Another model assumption,
panmixia, seems inappropriate for U5 and U6 together,
since they have evolved on opposite sides of the Mediterranean Sea. Thus it seems appropriate to compute
the BSPs separately. We performed this using the information gleaned from the initial internal calibration on
the joint U5/U6 data set (in order to exploit calibration
points in both haplogroups).
The BSP for U5 shows a small effective population
size from the time of its origin until a strong expansion
led to a ~11-fold increase within a period of ~6 ka in
the late Pleistocene/early Holocene (14.3-8.3 ka). Following this, the effective size again remained more or
less constant till a second strong expansion occurred,

leading to an increase of ~5-fold after 4.3 ka (we took
the year 1600AD as the most recent time-point [56]).
For U6, the pattern is slightly more complex. The initial
effective size was somewhat larger (~1.6 times) compared with U5, and the initial expansion begins earlier,
~22.2 ka, with a more gradual expansion until ~10.2 ka,
leading to a 3-fold increase. As with U5, there is a
further expansion in the Neolithic, after 4.8 ka with a
shallower increase of ~1.5-fold.

Conclusions
The Bayesian evolutionary analyses conducted in this
work, as well as the comparison between recently
updated mutation rates and the improvement of the
phylogenetic resolution for the mitochondrial haplogroup U6, enable us to revise our interpretation of the
evolutionary history of haplogroup U6 and sketch a
demographic prehistory for North Africa, which we can
then compare with that of Europe. In particular, they

Pereira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:390
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/390

allow us to address many of the archaeological questions
raised in the introduction.
The recently revised archaeological dates for the Aterian industry of North Africa emphasize that the makers
of this industry do not appear to have left any imprint in
the maternal lineages of present-day North Africans. The
oldest arrivals amongst extant mtDNAs appear to be the
U6 and M1 lineages, which date to 36.6 (24.9; 48.8) and
25.4 (17.9; 33.1) ka respectively [31]. As with U5 in
Europe [11], the arrival time could be older in each case,
since the haplogroups appear likely to have arisen within
the southern Mediterranean region from haplogroup U
and M ancestors, making dating the arrival time very
imprecise. Nevertheless, the estimates seem to match
best the appearance of the Upper Palaeolithic Dabban
industry in Cyrenaïca, as suggested before [15,23].
There is an intriguing further signal in the U6 data,
witnessed by the Bayesian skyline plot. For the European
haplogroup U5, which is one of the most ancient in
Europe [11], we identified a strong expansion (an ~11fold increase in effective population size) occurring in
the Lateglacial period between the LGM and the beginning of the Holocene, followed by another large population expansion (~5-fold) after 5 ka, evidently associated
with late Neolithic/early Bronze Age (rather than, for
example, the early Neolithic expansion in Europe, which
began ~8.5 ka). For U6, by contrast, the corresponding
increases in effective sizes were less marked (~3-fold
and ~1.5-fold, respectively), and the signal indicates that
the expansion began earlier, ~22 ka. This coincides closely with the beginning of the Iberomaurusian industry
in the Maghreb. These results therefore suggest that the
Iberomaurusian was initiated by an expansion of modern humans of ultimately Near Eastern, carrying
mtDNA haplogroup U6, who had spread into Cyrenaïca
~35-45 ka and produced the Dabban industry. The link
back to the Near East and the European Early Upper
Palaeolithic (which likely has the same source) may
explain the suggested skeletal similarities between the
robust Iberomaurusian “Mechta-Afalou” burials and
European Cro-Magnon remains, as well as the case for
continuity of the bearers of the Iberomaurusian industry
from Morocco with later northwest African populations
suggested by the dental evidence [57].
We can compare the U5 and U6 BSPs with the ones
for geographic regions published in Atkinson et al. [56],
inferred from a more random sample of mtDNA
sequences observed in those regions - for which the
model behind the BSP is, on the surface, a better match.
Similar to the situation reported for sub-Saharan Africa
[37], the picture that emerges from U5 and U6 appears
to represent well the general demographic patterns
observed in, respectively, Europe and North Africa
(although the latter was combined the Near East).

Page 8 of 10

This observation suggests that by investigating in
depth U6 and U5, the oldest lineages present in North
Africa and Europe, respectively, we are indeed receiving
signals from the demographic pre-history of modern
humans in these regions.
Aside from U6, North Africa was also the recipient of
European, Near Eastern and sub-Saharan African
lineages most of which most likely arrived in the Holocene. Haplogroups H1, H3 and V expanded in Iberia in
the Lateglacial/postglacial [11,58-61], and evidently
spread into North Africa from Iberia across the Gibraltar Straits, most likely in the early Holocene [62-65].
Although the postglacial Capsian industry appears to
have originated in eastern Algeria, it is tempting to
hypothesize a connection with the arrival of these new
populations from southwest Europe. Intriguingly,
although U5b1, which also expanded from southwest
Europe in the Lateglacial, has not been seen in Moroccan Berbers, it has been identified amongst Algerian
Berbers and Fulbe from Senegal, as well as Iberia, Italy
and northern Eurasian Saami and Yakut [44].
Most sub-Saharan lineages observed in North Africa
are presently difficult to date and probably arrived at various times, but the age of the sub-Saharan subclade L3e5
indicates its arrival in North Africa from the south ~7 ka,
following its expansion in the immediate postglacial
humid phase ~11.5 ka [66]. Other L3 lineages seem to
have been introduced even in more recent times, during
the slave trade initiated by the Arab conquest of North
Africa [67]. The Near Eastern haplogroups J and T (and
probably K) appear to be concentrated more towards the
east [68], mirroring the higher densities of U6, H and V
in the west [64]. These may reflect the spread of the Neolithic into North Africa from the Levant, but their phylogeography awaits detailed analysis.
