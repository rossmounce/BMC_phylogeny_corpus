Abstract
Background: Discriminating taxa with the nuclear marker, amplified fragment length
polymorphism (AFLP) has been accomplished for various organisms in economic, ecological, and
evolutionary studies. The protocol available for AFLP generation does not require prior knowledge
of the genome; however, it is often extensively modified to fit the needs of the researcher.
Modification of this protocol for new labs is intimidating and time-consuming, particularly for taxa
in which AFLP have not been previously developed. Furthermore, determining what constitutes
quality output during different stages of fragment generation is not well defined and this may further
hinder the use AFLP by new researchers.
Findings: We present a step-by-step AFLP protocol, using flourophore-labeled primers for use
with automated sequencers, including examples of both successful and unsuccessful results. We
sufficiently normalized peak intensity and standardized allele calling across all samples for each
primer combination. Repeatability was assessed with a phylogenetic tree in which replicate samples
clustered together using the minimum evolution procedure. We found differences greater than
10% in allele position among replicated samples would cause replicates to no longer cluster. To
minimize offset allele positions, we suggest that researchers analyze different primer combinations
at the same time using multiple dyes with the automated sequencer to minimize mismatched alleles
across replicates.
Conclusion: For researchers wanting to use AFLP, this molecular technique is difficult and timeconsuming to develop. Clarifying what constitutes quality output for each step in AFLP generation
will help to reduce redundant trials in protocol development and, in turn, advance the discipline of
population genetics.

Background
Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) has
been extensively used to investigate population genetics
[1,2], genome mapping [3,4], and genetic structure of
intra- and interspecific taxa [5-7], especially in plants,
microbes, and fungi, but less often for animal taxa [8].
This method has many benefits over other genetic tech-

niques for addressing questions in population genetics
including: low start-up cost, high repeatability, the ability
to assay a large number of polymorphic loci in many individuals in a relatively short period of time, and no prior
knowledge of the genome or sequence data is necessary
[8-14]. Using the original AFLP protocol [9,15], an investigator generates between 50 – 100 restriction fragments,

which are generally less than 600 base pairs (bp), per
primer combination, when fragments are amplified and
detected on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Technological advancements (e.g., automated capillary sequencers
and flourophore-labeled primers) have lead to reduced
scorer bias, increased the overall number of fragments
that may be scored with confidence, and promoted analyses of larger sample sizes [16].
There is a standard protocol available for AFLP generation
[9] that has been modified by researchers for their specific
study taxa [8]. However, modification of this protocol [9]
for new labs is intimidating and can be time-consuming
to develop for taxa in which AFLP have not been previously established. Even after successful AFLP fragment
generation, determining what constitutes quality AFLP
output (i.e., electropherograms) is unclear. Although software is available for analyzing electropherograms generated from automated capillary sequencers (e.g.,
GeneMapper or GeneMarker), there is a lack of clearly
refined protocols to assess the quality of generated AFLP
fragments. Thus, understanding and interpretation of successful results can be challenging to researchers first using
AFLP and redundant trials in protocol development can
hinder advancement of research. Because of these challenges, the objectives of this study were to: (1) provide
guidelines for AFLP generation with automated analyses
using a protocol amenable for disparate animal groups;
(2) construct procedures to normalize and standardize
AFLP electropherograms; and (3) test the repeatability of
AFLP samples processed with an automated capillary
sequencer and analyzed with applicable software.
Study Animals
Snails (Elimia) and salamanders (Desmognathus) were
used to evaluate the standardized AFLP protocol. Two different DNA-extraction techniques were employed to
achieve high-quality, whole genomic DNA. The DNA was
considered high quality if there was an optical density
(OD) of 260/230 between 1.8 – 2.1 and 260/280 between
1.8 – 1.9 using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop ND –
1000). Each sample was visually inspected on 1% sodium
borate agarose gels (Figure 1a).

For snails, whole genomic DNA was extracted from head
tissue using a modified protocol [17]. Each snail head was
placed in a 600 μl CTAB solution (2% CTAB, 1.4 M NaCl,
20 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris – HCl pH 8, 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol) to which 15 μl of 10 mg/ml Proteinase K was
added followed by incubation at 55°C for 3 h. Each sample was washed twice with 600 μl of chloroform:isoamyl
alcohol (24:1) and allowed to precipitate overnight in
cold isopropyl alcohol. Precipitated DNA was purified
with 95% ethanol and a final 70% ethanol wash. Samples
contained a strong band of whole genomic DNA, but also

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/2/26

contained degraded DNA and RNA that negatively affect
the quality of downstream reactions [15]. Thus, all samples were further purified using a QIAEX II Gel Extraction
Kit (Qiagen, Calencia, CA). This procedure yielded
between 5 – 75 ng of high-quality DNA.
For salamanders, whole genomic DNA was extracted from
approximately 5 mm of tail tissue from each individual
using a DNeasy Kit protocol for animal tissues (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA). This protocol yielded between 5 – 100 ng
of high-quality, whole genomic DNA.
Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism and Primer
Screening Protocol
All enzymes and restriction buffers were obtained from
New England Biolabs, unless otherwise noted. Digestion
reactions in 20 μl volumes were performed on whole
genomic DNA with a concentration ranging from 10 – 70
ng/μl following cocktail per reaction: 2 μl EcoRI 10×
restriction buffer, 1.0 μl EcoRI (20,000 U/ml), 0.2 μl MseI
(10,000 U/ml; in snails, 0.8 μl MseI was used), and 12 μl
H2O. Following a 5 h incubation period at 37°C (in
snails, 3 h); we ensured adequate digestion using a 1%
sodium borate agarose gel (Figure 1b). Before ligation,
double-stranded adaptor pairs (10 mM) were constructed
from the complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides (Table 1). These adaptor pairs were joined by combining 250 μl of each adapter and heating the solution at
95°C for 5 min and then cooled to 25°C (Table 2). Ligation proceeded using a 20 μl mixture consisting of 12 μl
H2O, 4 μl 10× T4 DNA ligase buffer, 1.5 μl of the EcoRI
and MseI adapter pairs (75 pmols), and 1.0 μl of T4 DNA
ligase to each digestion solution. These samples were
incubated for 10 h (in snails, for 12 h) at 16°C. Following
ligation, each sample was diluted with 160 μl H2O.

We conducted a preselective primer screen to determine
the efficacy of primer pairs. In the standardized protocol
[9], only one base is added during preselective PCR. We
tested EcoRI + NN, where N represents the number of
additional base pairs attached to the core sequence (i.e.,
NN = two additional base pairs; Table 1), and MseI + NN
primer combinations (n = 256) by checking for high-quality bands on a 1% sodium borate agarose gel, since this
was the most cost-effective means for determining primer
efficacy. Thus, we used this two base extension for preselective PCR. Using the chosen primer combinations, we
completed preselective PCR involving using the cocktail
in Table 2 and the cycling conditions in Table 3. Preselective solutions were diluted with 125 μl and 160 μl of H2O
in salamanders and snails, respectively. A 1% sodium
borate agarose gel was used to visually check each sample
(Figure 1c).

We ran a subsequent selective primer screen to determine
which EcoRI + NNN and MseI + NN would generate highest quality bands on a 1% sodium borate agarose gel.
When labeling EcoRI with a flourophore (i.e., 6-FAM) for
selective PCR, the label should always be attached to the
5' end and to any nucleotide except guanine because of
the effects of guanine quenching [18]. Using the chosen
primer combinations, we completed selective PCR using
the cocktail in Table 4 and the cycling conditions in Table
5. A 1% sodium borate agarose gel was used to visually
check each sample (Figure 1d). In general, if samples were
visible on the 1% sodium borate agarose gel they are too
strong for the autosequencer; thus, all samples were
diluted between 25 – 50% with doubly-distilled water.
Diluted selective amplification products were purified
using fine G-50 Sephadex (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.). We
loaded 1.5 μl of purified product per sample along with
0.5 μl GeneScan-500 ROX ladder (PerkinElmer, Inc.) into
96-well plates. Samples were analyzed using an automated ABI 3100 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems)
and electropherograms were imported into GeneMarker v.
1.6 (SoftGenetics, LLC.) for analyses.
Fragment Analysis
Using GeneMarker v. 1.6, intensity of peaks in the raw
data were normalized, without application of the size
standard, by generating a template with the AFLP signal
processed between 1200 and 11,500 relative fluorescence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/2/26

units (rfu). For the raw data analysis, local southern sizecall algorithm, peak saturation, baseline subtraction, pullup correction, and spike removal correction were selected
(Figure 2). Following normalization, allele call was performed with application of the size standard.
For allele-called data, only electropherograms in which
the size standard used in the analysis matched a theoretical standard by 90% or greater were included for further
analysis. A peak was considered an allele if peak intensity
was between 100 – 8000 rfu and peaks were longer than
60 bp, which was the shortest fragment length in which
clearly defined peaks appeared (Figure 3). However, other
researchers have suggested that fragments should only be
considered alleles with minimum lengths of 75 bp [19]
and 125 bp [20] due to an increased probability of homoplasy. Allele-called data was standardized across individuals for each primer combination by creating a unique
standardizing panel (i.e., panel editor in GeneMarker v.
1.6). To generate a standardizing panel, we chose 10 individuals from discrete populations that exhibited the greatest polymorphism (i.e., greatest number and largest range
of peaks). Allele positions within templates were further
standardized by setting the range around an allele as ± 0.4
bp (i.e., bin size in GeneMarker v. 1.6). Thus, two fragments that fell within this range would be considered one
fragment. Creation of a standardizing template for each
primer combination ensured that peak position (a peak is

equivalent to an allele) was precise for all electropherograms.
After normalization, a binary matrix was generated for
each primer combination. An allele was denoted as "1" if
the peak intensity was greater than 100 rfu and the fragment occurred between 60 and 350 bp. An allele was considered as "0" if these conditions were not met. Any
questionable alleles were manually checked and scored
accordingly. All matrices were combined to form one
binary matrix for further analyses.
Repeatability
To test repeatability of replicated samples within and
among 96-well plates, PAUP* v. 4.0b10 [21] was used to
generate phylogenetic hypotheses using the minimumevolution procedure (total character and Nei-Li [22] distance options were selected). For each primer combination, replicated samples were placed within a binary
matrix with an equal number of non-replicated samples.
Repeatability was achieved if replicate samples were most
closely related to each other.

Results and discussion
We generated AFLP fragments for two unrelated taxa using
a modified AFLP protocol of Vos et al. [9] and Berres et al.
[15]. Our data support findings in the literature that the
quality of DNA is more important than the initial concentration [11] as we successfully recovered alleles of samples
that varied in DNA concentration from 5 to 70 ng/μl. It is
necessary to visually check (i.e., on a gel) the quality of the
DNA to ensure that minimal degradation has occurred if
samples are stored at -20°C for more than a few weeks in
a 0.5 μl PCR tube.
During various stages of AFLP generation, DNA concentration may be too high and, if left undiluted, the automated sequencer will become saturated. This will result in
peaks that are squared-off at the apex and do not reach the
baseline (Figure 4d). In order to prevent saturation, gel
images are essential to determine the level of dilution, if
any, for each sample; we found that the dilution amount
varied between our taxa. We found that after preselective
PCR for salamanders, samples were diluted to one part
PCR product to three parts water, and for snails, samples
were diluted to one part PCR product to five parts water.
For other unrelated taxa, researchers may need to further

modify concentrations to achieve optimal datasets as
shown in Figures 2 and 3.
Some samples meeting all methodological requirements
still yielded poor quality electropherograms and were
excluded from analyses (Figures 4 and 5). Generally, we
found that normalization of raw data using techniques
such as pull-up correction, baseline subtraction, peak saturation, smoothing, spike removal, and local southern
size call were sufficient to normalize peak intensity across
all electropherograms. If normalization is not successful,
peaks will extend either below the size standard (Figure
4a) or above the saturation point of 8000 rfu (Figure 4d).
If this occurs, even after implementation of the normalization procedure, the researcher must repeat PCR stages
for any failed samples.
After raw data were successfully normalized (Figure 2),
electropherograms were standardized using the panel editor. This allowed for precise calling of alleles across all
samples for each primer combination (Figure 5). Generally, most samples conformed to successful allele calling;
however, it is essential that each sample is manually
checked to ensure alleles are properly called. Regardless of
the quality of the electropherogram, there will be peaks
that cannot confidently called by the software (denoted
by a '?' in GeneMarker v. 1.6). In this case, each questionable peak must be manually checked and subsequently
scored.
Repeatability is essential for the construction of phylogenetic hypotheses using AFLP fragments [8]. The use of a
few replicated samples from a 96-well plate allows for
cost-effective and reliable tests of repeatability. We were
able to generate lineages that contain replicate samples
using the minimum evolution procedure. Nodes containing only individual replicate samples were formed in
every case for all primer combinations (results not
shown). In addition, we calculated a 10% threshold value,
which we define as the percentage of allelic differences
between replicate samples, in which replicate samples did
not form distinct lineages. This threshold value is markedly greater than expected. Although not used in this
study, researchers may want to consider the use of the
multiple dyes feature available with automated capillary
systems. Because this methodology allows for the simultaneous analysis of several primer combinations, it is a costeffective, efficient means to generate a large number of
AFLP fragments while reducing scoring errors that may be
associated with batch effects.

presented a modified protocol that generates AFLP fragments in snails and salamanders, with options for refining
this technique to suit the needs of most researchers.
Refinement of existing AFLP protocols was essential to
facilitate and encourage the broader use of AFLP fragments in genetic studies in animal taxa. Our protocol provides a starting point for researchers to use AFLP, in
studies of natural animal population regardless of their
taxonomic status and genomic complexity.
