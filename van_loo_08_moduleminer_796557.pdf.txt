Abstract
We present ModuleMiner, a novel algorithm for computationally detecting cis-regulatory modules
(CRMs) in a set of co-expressed genes. ModuleMiner outperforms other methods for CRM
detection on benchmark data, and successfully detects CRMs in tissue-specific microarray clusters
and in embryonic development gene sets. Interestingly, CRM predictions for differentiated tissues
exhibit strong enrichment close to the transcription start site, whereas CRM predictions for
embryonic development gene sets are depleted in this region.

Background

The identification and functional annotation of transcriptional regulatory sequences in the human genome is lagging
far behind the rapidly increasing knowledge of proteinencoding genes. These transcriptional regulatory sequences
are often build up in a modular manner and exert their function in cis through the concerted binding of multiple transcription factors (and co-factors), resulting in the formation
of protein complexes that interact with RNA polymerase II
[1,2]. These sequences are called cis-regulatory modules
(CRMs). In theory, these CRMs can be detected by the presence of multiple transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). In
practice, however, reliable detection of functional TFBSs is
difficult and results in many false positives, partly because
these binding sites are too short and too degenerate [3].
Hence, the computational detection of functional regulatory
sequences in the human genome remains a formidable
challenge.

Multiple methods have been developed that aim to detect regulatory sequences computationally [4-8]. Promising and validated results have been delivered mostly in model organisms
with relatively compact genomes (for example, Drosophila
melanogaster) [9-11]. In the larger human genome, deep
sequence conservation (for instance, up to zebrafish) or
extreme sequence conservation (for example, perfect conservation in mouse over 200 base pairs), irrespective of TFBS
detection, remains the method of choice for approaches validating regulatory sequences in vitro or in vivo [12-14].
Although these conservation approaches are quite successful
in predicting which regions have a regulatory function, they
provide no information regarding what expression pattern
these regions produce and by which transcription factors they
are targeted.
When several similar CRMs have been characterized, and the
regulatory factors and binding sites have been elucidated, one

can use this knowledge to find new examples of similar CRMs
that direct the transcription of other genes that are involved
in the same process. A number of computational methods
have been described that apply this approach [15-17]. These
methods have been highly successful [10,11,18], but in practice - apart from in Drosophila embryonic development - the
lack of available data often precludes the application of these
approaches.

models' (TRMs) [24]. We postulate that a good TRM can
retrieve targets in the genome. Therefore, we express the fitness of a TRM in terms of its target gene recovery and we
select the TRM that has maximum specificity for the given set
of co-expressed genes, using a whole-genome optimization
strategy. To determine the fitness of a TRM, each gene's
search space is first scored with the TRM, where we define a
gene's search space as the collection of all conserved noncoding sequences within 10 kilobases (kb) 5' of the transcription
start site (TSS; see Materials and methods, below). These
scores are then used to rank all genes in the genome. Finally,
the ranks of the given co-expressed genes are determined,
and the probability of observing this collection of ranks by
chance is calculated using order statistics (see Materials and
methods, below). If a large part of the co-expressed genes are
ranked high, then the order statistic is highly significant, and
hence the TRM is considered to have a high fitness for modeling similar CRMs that regulate these genes. ModuleMiner
searches the TRM with the most significant order statistic
(the best fitness) using a genetic algorithm (detailed in Materials and methods, below).

When this knowledge is not available, the detection of tissuespecific or process-specific CRMs can be tackled by looking
for recurring combinations of TFBSs in putative regulatory
regions of a set of co-expressed genes. A few methods applying this approach have been developed [19-22]. However,
partly because this is a more complex problem, these methods
have only been applied on a limited scale and few successful
predictions have been reported. To our knowledge, our ModuleSearcher method [20] is the only one to have yielded
results that have undergone experimental validation [23].
Here, we develop ModuleMiner, a novel algorithm designed
to detect similar CRMs in a set of co-expressed genes, focused
on the human genome. ModuleMiner does not require prior
knowledge of regulating transcription factors or annotated
binding sites, but uses only a library of position weight matrices (PWMs). Contrary to existing algorithms, which require a
priori knowledge of CRM properties (such as the length of the
CRMs or the number of binding sites) as input parameters,
ModuleMiner requires no parameters. In addition, ModuleMiner differs from existing similar approaches in that it
implements a whole-genome optimization strategy to look
specifically for signals that discriminate the given coexpressed genes from all other genes in the genome. By leaveone-out cross-validation on benchmark data, we show that
ModuleMiner outperforms other methods that computationally detect CRMs. Finally, we demonstrate that ModuleMiner
can successfully detect similar CRMs in microarray clusters
with a tissue-specific expression profile, as well as in custombuild gene sets related to specific embryonic developmental
processes. In total, ModuleMiner predicted 257 CRMs near to
the genes studied, as well as an additional 1,400 CRM predictions resulting from full genome scans for new target genes.
We further analyze these CRM predictions to elucidate differences between CRMs directing transcription in differentiated
tissues and CRMs directing transcription during embryonic
development.

Results
ModuleMiner: detection of similar CRMs in a set of coexpressed genes
We developed ModuleMiner, a novel algorithm to detect similar CRMs in a set of co-expressed genes. ModuleMiner models similar CRMs as a combination of motifs (represented by
PWMs) in the same way as in the report by Aerts and coworkers [20]. These models are called 'transcriptional regulatory

Volume 9, Issue 4, Article R66

Van Loo et al. R66.2

We introduce ModuleMiner and its rigorous validation procedure using an example case study. We constructed a highquality set of 12 smooth muscle marker genes [25], and performed leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). In each validation run, one gene was left out and ModuleMiner
constructed a TRM using the remaining 11 genes. This TRM
was then used to rank all genes in the genome and the position of the left-out gene was determined. The set of 12 ranks
obtained in this way was used to calculate sensitivity/specificity pairs, which were subsequently plotted on a receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve. We used the area under
the ROC curve (AUC) as a measure of ModuleMiner's performance on this set of co-expressed genes.
We repeated the LOOCV for three sets of candidate TFBSs
(Table 1). The first set includes predicted binding sites in
human-mouse conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs),
obtained by aligning 10 kb 5' of all human-mouse orthologs
and selecting regions of at least 75% identity over a minimum
of 100 base pairs. The second set includes a refined series of
binding sites from the first set; specifically, it retains only the
PWMs for which an instance is predicted in both human and
mouse CNSs (we follow the nomenclature presented by Berman and coworkers [10] and call these sites 'preserved' sites).
Finally, the third set is refined further from the second set;
specifically, the CNSs are obtained by aligning 10 kb 5' of all
human genes to 110 kb 5' + 100 kb 3' of the TSS of their mouse
orthologs (and hence correcting for possible differences in
TSS annotation). The resulting ROC curves are shown in Figure 1a. In all three cases, the AUC values are significantly
above 50% (the theoretical value obtained if the left-out genes
were ranked randomly), indicating that the TRMs obtained
are sensitive and specific in predicting CRMs near to the leftout genes.

larger. The selection of one TRM out of these similar TRMs is
inherently arbitrary and depends only marginally on the true
regulatory signals. To make ModuleMiner more robust to this
'noise', we cluster the top-scoring TRMs and select the most
prominent cluster instead of the single optimal TRM. We call
this cluster of TRMs a 'transcriptional regulatory global
model' (TRGM). The results of a LOOCV when using these
TRGMs (Figure 1b) show that this indeed has a positive effect
on ModuleMiner's performance: the AUCs increased by 6%
on average. Furthermore, these TRGMs provide additional
information compared with singular TRMs, because they
allow an estimate of the relative importance of each PWM
involved, as discussed below.
When comparing the performance of ModuleMiner (using
TRGMs) on the three sets of candidate binding sites, a large
difference between selecting all detected binding sites (set 1:
AUC value 84.6%) and restricting to preserved sites only (set
2: AUC value 92.8%) is apparent. Correcting for TSS differences in human and mouse (set 3: AUC value 92.5%) did not
increase this performance further. Thus, for this high-quality
set of co-expressed genes, the preservation of binding sites is
highly beneficial for efficient detection of CRMs. This strongly
suggests that for this gene set the trans-acting factors are conserved between human and mouse.
We next applied the ModuleMiner algorithm to the full set of
12 smooth muscle marker genes, using the site preservation
measure (set 2). The resulting TRGM identifies SRF, SMAD4,
SP1, and ATF3 as the main transcription factors involved in
the co-regulation of these genes (detailed ModuleMiner output is reported on our website [26]). Importantly, ModuleMiner implicates SRF as the most important smooth muscle
regulator, and suggests that smooth muscle specific regulation often entails two or more SRF binding sites, which is in
agreement with the literature [27].
To verify the added value of the resulting combination of
PWMs over SRF alone, we manually generated a TRGM containing only PWMs for SRF, and compared the performance
of this model with that of ModuleMiner. When we applied
this 'SRF only' TRGM to rank the genome, we obtained an
AUC of 79.9%, which is significantly smaller than the 92.8%
AUC of ModuleMiner (obtained in an LOOCV setting).

We conclude from these experiments that ModuleMiner
requires a critical mass of true positive genes for successful
detection of similar CRMs. However, when this critical mass
is present, ModuleMiner is highly robust to false-positive
genes.

Sensitivity of ModuleMiner's performance to the quality of the input genes
Sensitivity of ModuleMiner's performance to the quality of the input genes.
The ratio of true positive genes (containing the smooth muscle cisregulatory module [CRM]) to negative genes (approximated by random
genes) was varied. Each time, a leave-one-out cross-validation was
performed, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was
constructed, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated.
These AUCs were plotted as a function of the ratio negative genes/
positive genes. Because an AUC of 50% signifies random ordering of the
left-out genes (and hence indicates that no CRMs can be detected), this
value was taken as the origin on the y-axis. Blue: the number of positive
genes was kept constant at ten, and the number of negative genes was
varied. Red: the total number of genes was kept constant at ten, and the
ratio negative genes/positive genes was varied.

Sensitivity to noise
To assess the performance of ModuleMiner as a function of
the composition of the input set of co-expressed genes, we
performed LOOCV on input sets that contain a varying percentage of genuinely co-regulated genes ('true positives'). As
true positive genes, we selected the set of ten smooth muscle
markers that share similar CRMs that can be identified by
ModuleMiner (these ten genes all are ranked within the top
7% of the genome by a LOOCV, as shown in Figure 1b). We
approximated negative genes (genes that do not contain the
smooth muscle CRM) by random genes.
In a first analysis, we kept the number of true positive genes
constant at ten, and we added a varying number of negative
genes. The decrease in performance as a function of an
increasing number of negative genes was surprisingly small
(Figure 2). Even when only 10 out of 50 genes contained the
smooth muscle CRM, ModuleMiner was able to pick up this
signal (the AUC was 85.2%, and SRF and SP1 were still identified as key factors).
In a second analysis, we kept the total number of genes constant at ten, and we varied the percentage of negative genes.
We now observed a steep decrease in ModuleMiner performance as a function of an increasing percentage of negative
genes (Figure 2).

We next compared ModuleMiner with other in silico
approaches for CRM detection on benchmark data. From
PAZAR [28], we selected all 'boutiques' containing annotated
regulatory regions directing expression in a particular system: M02, muscle; M03, liver; M08, ORegAnno Stat1; and
M09, ORegAnno Erythroid. As a fifth benchmark set, we used
the 12 smooth muscle genes described above. On each of these
five sets, we compared the performance of ModuleMiner with
that of four state-of-the-art publicly available algorithms
designed to detect similar CRMs in co-expressed genes: ModuleSearcher [29], CREME [19], CisModule [22], and EMCMODULE [30]. We also included the Clover algorithm [31],
which looks for individual over-represented TFBSs in putative regulatory sequences of a set of co-expressed genes. We
note that our analysis does not focus specifically on the
known enhancers, but in contrast we consider all CNSs in the
entire 10 kb 5' of the TSS (which may or may not contain the
known enhancer, as well as other sequences). This effectively
mimics a real-life situation, where the exact location of the
regulatory sequences is not known a priori.
The CREME algorithm was unable to identify similar CRMs
in any of the five benchmark sets, most likely in part because
of its focus on larger sets of more loosely co-expressed genes
[19]. Using the remaining algorithms, we performed LOOCV
on each of the five benchmark sets. For this LOOCV, we used
each algorithm to train a TRM or TRGM using gene sets in
which one gene is left out (see Materials and methods, below,
for details). Hence, as training data, we used all CNSs in the
10 kb 5' of the TSS of the benchmark set, except for the leftout gene. For CisModule and EMCMODULE, the inputs were
the sequences of the CNSs; for Clover, the inputs where the
sequences of the CNSs as well as all TRANSFAC and JASPAR
vertebrate PWMs; for ModuleSearcher, the inputs were the
predicted binding sites within those CNSs, using all TRANSFAC and JASPAR vertebrate PWMs. The combination of
PWMs that each algorithm provided as output was used to
build a TRM or TRGM. We subsequently used the ModuleScanner algorithm to rank all genes in the genome based on the
predicted TRM/TRGM, and we used the results to construct
ROC curves. We used the site preservation measure (candidate TFBS set 2) for the ModuleMiner runs (because this was
the set in which we obtained the best results for the smooth
muscle genes). Because the other algorithms do not use site
preservation in the discovery step, we used candidate TFBS
set 1 (without preservation) also in their genome ranking
step. We also constructed random ROC curves based on
genome ranking using random TRMs (see Materials and
methods, below, for details).

On the OregAnno Erythroid benchmark set neither ModuleMiner nor any of the other algorithms appear to perform
better than random (Figure 3a). Because this is the smallest
set, containing only six genes with human-mouse CNSs, this
is consistent with the results we obtained in the previous section, in which we concluded that a critical number of co-regulated genes is required for CRM detection. In contrast, on
each of the four other benchmark sets, ModuleMiner performs better than random TRMs, as do some of the other
algorithms (Figure 3b-e). Comparing the performance of all
CRM detection algorithms, ModuleMiner appears to exhibit
the best performance in all four cases. Interestingly, only
ModuleMiner can compete with 'simple' TFBS over-representation in this setup, emulating a real-life situation in which
the regulatory sequences are not known. Indeed, only ModuleMiner outperforms Clover on four of the five benchmark
sets. On the fifth benchmark set (muscle), Clover and ModuleMiner seem to be closely matched, with the Clover method
showing a steeper start of the ROC curve.

5' of the TSS). This results in ten clusters with sizes ranging
from 26 to 214 genes. Large clusters were randomly divided in
a training set of 50 genes, and a test set containing the
remaining genes.

The performance of the other CRM detection algorithms can
be improved by using site preservation (TFBS set 2) in the
genome ranking step (Figure 3f-i), although ModuleMiner
outperforms all other CRM detection algorithms here also,
which suggests that the TRMs predicted by ModuleMiner are
more informative or more specific than those suggested by
other methods. Candidate TFBS set 2 was not in all cases the
optimal choice for ModuleMiner; on the muscle benchmark
set, candidate TFBS set 3 performed better (Figure 3j).
We noticed that the CRM predictions ModuleMiner made on
the muscle, liver, and ORegAnno Stat1 sets correspond well
with the known regulatory elements. The TRGMs ModuleMiner contructed contain PWMs for SRF, MEF2, Myf and
MyoD (muscle), HNF1, HNF3, HNF4 and CEBP (liver), and
STAT (ORegAnno Stat1), even though we used all CNSs in the
10 kb upstream region. In addition, the CRM predictions
mostly overlap the true enhancer, when the real regulatory
sequence was in our CNS collection. Indeed, for the muscle
set, in 9 of the 11 cases in which the known enhancer was in
our CNS set, ModuleMiner was ably to identify this region.
For the liver set, ModuleMiner identified seven out of eight
regulatory elements (data not shown).

Volume 9, Issue 4, Article R66

Van Loo et al. R66.5

Because it was our goal here to identify similar CRMs within
a subset of the genes in each microarray cluster, we used a
two-step procedure. First we detected which subset of genes
potentially share CRMs, and next we detected the actual
CRMs in their upstream regions (Figure 4a). The first step
consisted of a fivefold cross-validation, where in each validation run we used ModuleMiner to train a TRGM on four-fifths
of the genes in a cluster, and next we determined which of the
other one-fifth of left-out genes were targets of the TRGM. If
the total number of true target genes among left-out genes
was not significantly higher than random, then we concluded
that ModuleMiner is unable to detect similar CRMs within
this cluster. If on the other hand there was a significant
enrichment of these true target genes, then we concluded that
ModuleMiner can detect similar CRMs, and we used these
high scoring genes in the second step. In this second step,
ModuleMiner was applied to this focused subcluster,
identifying similar CRMs that regulate these genes. As an
extra validation, LOOCV was used to confirm the presence of
similar CRMs, as done previously on the smooth muscle and
other benchmark sets.
Application of this procedure to the microarray clusters
described above resulted in successful CRM detection in nine
out of the ten clusters (Table 2 and Figure 4b). In each case,
this success was confirmed by a LOOCV on the selected subcluster (all AUCs were significantly above 50%, with an average AUC of 90.3%; Figure 4c). For the TRGMs obtained for
clusters containing more than 50 genes, the number of targets
in the independent test set was determined. This was significantly higher than random in three of the five cases (Table 2).
In total, we predicted 209 CRMs. These ModuleMiner predictions can be viewed in detail on our website [26].

Detection of CRMs in embryonic development gene
sets
In the previous section we detected CRMs in microarray clusters expressed in different adult tissues. Next, we aimed to
predict CRMs involved in embryonic development processes.

Detection of CRMs in microarray clusters
Realizing that clustering of microarray data provides a rich
source of large co-expressed gene sets, in which robustness to
genes that are not co-regulated ('false positive genes') is critical, our sensitivity to noise analysis above encouraged us to
apply ModuleMiner to microarray clusters on a larger scale.
The GNF SymAtlas [32] contains expression profiles of 140
human and mouse tissues. Nelander and coworkers [33]
obtained gene clusters by hierarchically clustering this dataset, followed by a Pearson's correlation coefficient cut-off.
From this clustering, we selected all clusters with at least 25
genes in our dataset (genes with at least one CNS within 10 kb

We constructed five gene sets involved in specific embryonic
development processes, based on the literature (Table 3).
Contrary to the previous section, in which we aimed to detect
similar CRMs in a subset of the genes in the microarray
clusters (using a two-step approach), here we can assume that
the embryonic development gene set is more focused, and
hence we can directly apply ModuleMiner to these sets (as in
our high-quality smooth muscle gene set). We performed
LOOCV, confirming that ModuleMiner was able to successfully detect similar CRMs in all five gene sets (Table 3).

Characterization of the CRMs
The TRGMs that were predicted by ModuleMiner in each of
the ten microarray clusters and each of the five embryonic
development gene sets are summarized in Tables 4 and 5.
Apart from this TRGM, ModuleMiner also provides additional information characterizing the CRMs. We shall discuss
here the results we obtained in cluster 9, which contains
genes related to cardiac muscle function.
First, ModuleMiner characterizes the given input genes,
retrieving descriptions and commonly used identifiers (for
example, HGNC) from the Ensembl database. In addition, the
Gene Ontology (GO) terms annotated to the input genes are
retrieved, and the over-represented GO terms are reported.
For the cardiac muscle subcluster 'muscle contraction'
(GO:0006936), 'muscle development' (GO:0007517), 'organogenesis' (GO:0009887), 'contractile fiber' (GO:0043292),
and 'regulation of heart contraction rate' (GO:0008016) were
among the over-represented GO terms.
Next, ModuleMiner determines the weight of each PWM in
the TRGM (see Materials and methods, below). By grouping
similar PWMs, the weight of each trans-factor involved is
determined. The cardiac muscle TRGM contains PWMs for
SRF, MEF2A, myogenin, SP3, a thyroid hormone response
element (all with weights of approximately 1), and a muscle
TATA box (with weight approximately 0.5). ModuleMiner
also displays the CRMs that it identifies on the input genes.
Figure 4d shows this for the heart muscle genes.
Because our approach uses only human and mouse sequences
to model CRMs, sequenced genomes of other species can be
used as validation data. ModuleMiner employs the rat and
dog genomes for this purpose, by checking for CRMs that fit
the obtained TRGM in rat-dog CNSs. For the cardiac muscle
genes, 11 orthologs were present in our rat-dog TFBS database, seven of which were ranked within the top 10% of the
genome (P = 2.28 × 10-5).
Finally, ModuleMiner selects putative new target genes of the
TRGM from the complete genome. We aim to minimize noise
in these target gene predictions by using network level conservation [34], particularly through phylogenetic fusion of
target gene rankings. To this end, first all genes in the humanmouse TFBS database (excluding the input genes) and all
(noninput) genes in the dog-rat TFBS database are ranked
separately. ModuleMiner then fuses these two rankings into

one global ranking using order statistics (similar to the
approach used by Aerts and coworkers [23,35]). Among the
100 top ranking new target genes of the cardiac muscle
TRGM were MYL3 ('cardiac myosin light chain 1'), MYOD1
('myoblast determination protein 1'), TNNI1 ('troponin I'),
and MYH3 ('myosin heavy chain, embryonic skeletal
muscle').
The results we obtained on all sets of co-expressed genes discussed in this work can be viewed on our website [26].

Where are the CRM predictions located?
ModuleMiner successfully detected nine sets of similar CRMs
in the ten microarray clusters and five sets of similar CRMs in
the five embryonic development gene sets. In total, 257 CRMs
were predicted. In addition to this, ModuleMiner predicted
100 new target genes of each TRGM. We next used this compendium of 1,657 CRMs to examine their positions relative to
the TSSs of the genes that they regulate.
Because a gene's search space was defined as all CNSs within
10 kb 5' of the TSS, we first examined the distributions of CNS
locations, because these represent the background distribution to which the CRM locations will be compared. A first
important observation is that the CNSs are highly over-represented close to the TSS, as shown in Figure 5a,b. The type of
gene set, namely adult tissue versus embryonic development,
introduces a second CNS location bias (Figure 5c). Indeed,
the adult tissue CNS set is enriched in sequences close to the
TSS (<200 base pairs; P = 7.6 × 10-16 by a Wilcoxon rank sum
test), whereas the embryonic development CNS set is
depleted in sequences close to the TSS and enriched in
sequences further from the TSS (2,000 to 4,000 base pairs; P
= 5.6 × 10-7). When evaluating each of the gene sets separately
(Figure 5f), eight of the nine adult tissue CNS sets are
enriched in sequences less than 200 base pairs from the TSS
(in six cases, this was statistically significant by a χ2 test),
whereas all five embryonic development CNS sets are
depleted in sequences less then 200 base pairs from the TSS
(in three cases, this was statistically significant).
Next, we examine the location distribution of the CRMs that
were identified by ModuleMiner. For adult tissue genes,
CRMs are strongly over-represented close to the TSS (Figure
5d). Of these CRMs, 63% are within 200 base pairs of the TSS.
In contrast, the CRMs that ModuleMiner identified near to
the embryonic development genes are depleted close to the

Application of ModuleMiner to microarray clusters
Application of ModuleMiner to microarray clusters. (a) The two-step procedure used to detect similar cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in a subset of genes
within a given microarray cluster. In the first step, a fivefold cross-validation is performed, and the number of left-out genes considered as target genes is
counted. If this number is significantly more than expected under a random distribution of the ranks, then these genes are transferred to the second step.
In this second step, ModuleMiner is used to model the similar CRMs regulating the genes in this focused subcluster. (b) Results of the first step of the
procedure in panel (a) for the ten microarray clusters and the three different sets of candidate transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Significantly
higher numbers of target genes among the left-out genes than randomly expected are depicted by an asterisk. Clusters 7 and 10 only contained sufficient
genes (≥ 25) in TFBS set 3 and therefore are omitted for the other two sets. (c) Leave-one-out cross-validation results on the subclusters with a significant
enrichment of target genes from panel (b). Each left-out gene was ranked using the transcriptional regulatory global model (TRGM) obtained on the
remaining genes. Next, sensitivity/specificity pairs where calculated for different detection thresholds, and these were used to construct receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves. The areas under these ROC curves (AUCs) were calculated and are depicted here. The colors are as in panel (b). (d)
Presented is an example of a set of similar CRMs identified by ModuleMiner. These results were obtained on the cardiac muscle genes by the procedure
depicted in panel (a). Each horizontal line represents a human-mouse conserved noncoding sequence (CNS) upstream of a gene within the cluster. The
different colored boxes represent binding sites of different transcription factors. Detailed results, including descriptions of the genes shown, and the exact
positions of the CNSs are available on our website [26].

TSS and enriched further away (1,000 to 2,000 base pairs).
These conclusions remain valid even when controlling for
both biases mentioned above; comparing Figure 5d to Figure
5c (the predicted CRMs in Figure 5d can be considered a
selection from the CNS sets in Figure 5c), the enrichment of
predicted CRMs directing expression in adult tissues close to
the TSS persisted (P = 2.6 × 10-27). (This was calculated as follows; the distances to the TSS of the predicted CRMs and all
CNSs of the genes in the microarray clusters were ranked and
the Wilcoxon rank sum test was applied.) For the CRMs

directing expression in embryonic development, no statistically significant deviation from random selection from the
embryonic development CNS sets could be identified (P =
0.18). When considering the gene sets separately, in eight
microarray clusters expressed in adult tissues CRMs are
enriched in sequences close to the TSS (Figure 5g; this was
statistically significant when controlling for bias in six cases).
In contrast, in four embryonic development gene sets, CRMs
are depleted close to the TSS (markedly, for three of these

Transcription factor binding site (TFBS) sets: set 1 includes human-mouse conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) 10 kilobases 5' of the
transcription start site (TSS); set 2 includes set 1 + binding site preservation; and set 3 includes set 2 + correction for TSS differences. For clusters in
which multiple TFBS sets resulted in successful cis-regulatory module (CRM) detection, only the result showing the best cross-validation
performance is shown. Genes (in the cluster) that by cross-validation were ranked within the top 10% of the genome where considered target genes
of the transcriptional regulatory global model (TRGM). The total number of CRMs constitutes all successful CRM predictions near to genes in the
cluster. CRM predictions were considered successful if the TRGM score was sufficient to rank the target gene within the top 10% of the genome. In
some cases, multiple CRMs are found that control the same target gene.

sets, no CRMs were predicted within 200 base pairs of the
TSS).
A similar difference in TSS distance distribution was also
observed for the new target genes (Figure 5e). Here as well,
the distances to the TSS of the CRMs predicted to direct
expression in adult tissues were clearly nonrandomly distributed compared with all CNSs (P = 3.6 × 10-74 by Wilcoxon
rank sum test). For the CRMs predicted to direct expression
in embryonic development, no statistically significant difference was observed (by Wilcoxon rank sum test). However,
these sequences appear to be (slightly) depleted within 200
base pairs of the TSS (P = 1.5 × 10-4 by a χ2 test). Considering
each of the gene sets separately (Figure 5h), in seven adult tissue microarray clusters, CRMs were significantly enriched
within 200 base pairs of the TSSs, whereas for two embryonic
development gene sets CRMs were significantly depleted
close to the TSS. Although in six cases this effect was highly
significant (P < 10-9), it was smaller than the effect within the
clusters (compare Figures 5d and 5e).
In summary, the CRMs that ModuleMiner detected were nonrandomly positioned in the genome. CRMs predicted to direct
expression in adult tissues were highly enriched very close to
the TSS, whereas CRMs predicted to direct expression in
embryonic development were depleted very close to the TSS.

Discussion

Although the sequence of the human genome has been available for a considerable time now, our ability to chart the
regions that control gene expression is still limited. The situ-

ation appears to improve as a function of smaller genome
size. Indeed, in the Drosophila early segmentation network,
CRMs can be predicted based on known examples [10,11]. In
the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with a much smaller
genome, it is possible to go one step further and predict the
expression of genes based only on upstream sequences [36].
Here, we focus on the computational detection of CRMs in the
human genome, and hence this work makes a contribution
toward bridging this gap.
ModuleMiner detects CRMs by taking as input a set of coexpressed genes, under the assumption that a subset of these
are co-regulated, and looking for a recurrent pattern of (computationally predicted) TFBSs. The advantages of this
approach are that it does not require known examples and
that it allows prediction of a probable function for the
detected CRMs.
ModuleMiner is similar in scope to ModuleSearcher [20,29]
and CREME [19]. It differs from these previous approaches in
that ModuleMiner maximizes specificity for the given set of
co-expressed genes by performing a whole-genome optimization. Indeed, ModuleMiner optimizes the combined rankings
of the given gene set in a ranking of the complete genome. In
addition, this approach allows comparison between TRMs
with different parameters (for example, maximum CRM
length, and number of PWMs in the TRM). Therefore, ModuleMiner can optimize over these parameters, and hence our
approach effectively eliminates the need for parameters
required by previous approaches.

A key review or book used as a basis for construction of the development gene set is given in the first column. The genes in each set as well as the
detailed results can be viewed at our website [26]. Transcription factor binding site (TFBS) sets: set 1 includes the human-mouse conserved
noncoding sequences (CNSs) 10 kilobases 5' of the transcription start site (TSS); set 2 includes set 1 + binding site preservation; and set 3 includes
set 2 + correction for TSS differences. For clusters where multiple TFBS sets resulted in successful cis-regulatory module (CRM) detection, only the
result showing the best cross-validation performance is shown. Genes (in the cluster) that by cross-validation where ranked within the top 10% of
the genome where considered target genes of the transcriptional regulatory global model. LOOCV, leave-one-out cross-validation.

Other algorithms have been developed that aim to detect similar CRMs in a set of co-expressed genes that (contrary to the
approaches described above) do not use a library of PWMs
[21,22,30,37]. Instead, and in addition to optimizing the
combination of motifs, these algorithms optimize the motifs
themselves. Hence, these methods attempt to solve a problem
with considerably greater complexity, resulting in lower performance, as confirmed by our comparison on benchmark
data. Given the extremely poor performance of motif
detection methods in organisms other than yeast [38], we
have opted to circumvent motif optimization by using experimentally determined PWMs. Note that this decision does not
necessarily limit the search to known PWMs, because libraries of computationally predicted PWMs are also available (for
example, the phylofacts PWM library [39]). In addition, we
believe that with the emergence of the protein binding microarray technology [40], high quality PWMs will soon become
available for a large fraction of the human transcription factor
repertoire. Even though the currently available libraries of
experimental PWMs exhibit high redundancy and may contain low quality PWMs, our new approach of clustering
similar TRMs is able to group redundant PWMs, and our validations show that in many cases a combination of five experimental PWMs can capture enough information of a CRM to
yield acceptable genome-wide specificity levels.
ModuleMiner outputs the predicted CRMs and a TRGM. This
TRGM can be considered a bag of PWMs (selected from
TRANSFAC and JASPAR), with a weight associated to each
PWM. Therefore, this TRGM not only predicts the transcription factors that function in the process under study, but it
also allows an assessment of the relative importance of each
of these transcription factors.
TRGMs do not contain spatial relations between TFBSs
(except for the total size of the CRMs and a Boolean parameter indicating whether different binding sites can overlap).
Although certain spatial relations between transcription factors working in concert are known to exist (for example

[41,42]), we did not find any reports indicating that this is the
rule rather then the exception. Therefore, we reasoned that
any such relationships should not be hard-coded into the
TRGMs, but rather would become apparent by inspection of
the predicted CRMs. Upon inspection of the predicted CRMs
presented above, no such spatial relationships surfaced.
Our method for scoring a sequence using a TRM or TRGM
(see Materials and methods, below) does not take homotypic
clustering of TFBSs into account (like hidden Markov model
based methods do [15,17,43]). However, this cooperative
binding of one transcription factor can nevertheless be modeled in our framework by the construction of a TRM or TRGM
that contains multiple instances of the same PWM. Therefore,
if multiple instances of a specific transcription factor are
important for the regulation of a set of co-regulated genes,
then this is represented accordingly in the optimal model. For
example, when applying ModuleMiner to the tightly coexpressed set of smooth muscle markers, the transcription
factor SRF occurs two or three times in each of the TRMs in
the resulting TRGM, suggesting an extensive cooperation
between SRF binding sites for smooth muscle specific transcription regulation. In contrast, the SMAD4, SP1, and ATF3
PWMs occur exactly once in 97.5% of the TRMs (SMAD4 and
SP1 occur twice in 1.5% and 1% of the TRMs, respectively).
ModuleMiner takes the genomic background sequence into
account in two ways. First, a third order background model is
used in the process of annotating putative TFBSs. Second, our
optimization strategy selects the TRM (or TRGM) that optimally separates the given genes (sequences) from all other
genes in the genome. Hence, our system corrects both for
local sequence properties (by the third order background
model) as for more global sequence properties (by selecting
against combinations of TFBSs that occur independently of
the given sequences).
We included all CNSs up to 10 kb 5' of the TSS in our pipeline.
Although this choice is inherently arbitrary, it is motivated by

the following arguments. First, sequences 3' of the TSS might
harbor translational regulatory signals, which we do not wish
to model here. Second, potential regulatory sequences far
upstream can be difficult to assign to a target gene. Third,
selecting 10 kb 5' of the TSS has proven to be valuable in our
previous study [20], and others have made similar choices as
well [44]. In a previous study, in which CRMs were predicted
in an unbiased way across the complete human genome [8], it
was shown that CRMs are highly depleted between 10 kb and
30 kb 5' of the TSS.
The validation framework that we use, combining genomewide ranking with LOOCV, could also be useful in evaluating
or comparing hypotheses regarding the working principles of
transcription regulation, and in this regard can be considered
similar in scope to CodeFinder [24]. In this work, two such
tests are implicitly performed: CRMs driving a tissue-specific
expression pattern are compared with CRMs driving an
embryonic development expression pattern; and by comparing the three sets of putative TFBSs (for example, Figures 1,
3j, and 4b) the importance of binding site preservation is

evaluated, as well as the impact of a correction for differences
in TSSs between human and mouse.
Construction of a high-quality set of co-regulated genes
involved in a certain process under study is not always
straightforward. In this regard, robustness to noise in a set of
putative co-expressed genes is highly desirable in an algorithm to detect similar CRMs. We found ModuleMiner to be
highly robust to the quality of this input gene set. Indeed, in
our experiments with smooth muscle marker genes we
observed that ModuleMiner was able to pick up the correct
signal even when only 10 out of 50 given genes are really coregulated (Figure 2). These properties of ModuleMiner
prompted us to apply the algorithm to gene sets obtained from
clustering microarray data. In nine out of ten microarray clusters, ModuleMiner succeeded in finding similar CRMs in a subset of the genes. Perhaps unsurprisingly, a critical mass of coregulated genes is required for ModuleMiner to detect similar
CRMs. However, this minimum required number of co-regulated genes is sufficiently small so as not to preclude application of the algorithm. This is illustrated both by our results
obtained on the smooth muscle genes (Figure 2) and by the

successful CRM detection in two small heart development
gene sets (Table 3).
Application of ModuleMiner to the smooth muscle marker
genes resulted in CRMs with multiple binding sites for SRF,
and with single binding sites for SMAD4, SP1, and ATF3.
Both SRF and SP1 have been shown to play a role in regulating smooth muscle specific expression [27]. Furthermore,
SMADs are effectors of the transforming growth factor-β signaling pathway, and have been shown to work in concert with
SRF to control smooth muscle cell differentiation [45]. ModuleMiner identified transcription factors known to play a key
role in other co-expressed gene sets as well. Examples are
GATA factors, NFATs and HAND1 in heart development;
HNF-1 and HNF-4 in liver-specific gene expression; PU.1 in
lymphocyte specific gene expression; and myogenin, SRF, the
thyroid hormone receptor, and MEF2 in heart-specific gene
expression.
Imposing trans-factor conservation by motif preservation
between human and mouse sequences of a CNS significantly
improved the performance of ModuleMiner on the set of
smooth muscle marker genes. A similar approach has also
been shown to improve CRM detection performance in the
Drosophila early segmentation gene network [10]. When we
applied ModuleMiner to the microarray clusters and the
embryonic development gene sets, in some cases this transfactor conservation also increased performance (microarray
clusters 6, 7 and 9, and the neural crest cell gene set), but in
other cases it did not.

Correcting for possible differences in TSS in human and
mouse by a three-step alignment procedure (see Materials
and methods, below) resulted in increased performance for
most of the microarray clusters, but not for the development
gene sets. This marked difference may be related to the different locations of the detected CRMs in these two different
systems.

enhancers. Notwithstanding some reservations on extrapolating these data, we conclude that the predictive accuracy of
ModuleMiner for detection of regulatory regions (CRMs)
near to a set of co-regulated genes is quite high.

We observed a significant difference in the locations of the
CRMs ModuleMiner predicted to direct expression in adult
tissues and the CRMs ModuleMiner predicted to direct
expression in embryonic development. CRMs driving tissuespecific expression are highly over-represented within 200
base pairs of the TSS. In contrast, CRMs driving expression in
embryonic development are more evenly distributed in the 10
kb sequences we considered, and appear to be under-represented within 200 base pairs of the TSS. These results suggest
that transcription regulation of tissue-specific expression is
mainly exerted by proximal promoters, whereas transcription
regulation of expression during embryonic development
appear mainly to be exerted by more distal enhancers.
ModuleMiner can be applied to three conceptually different
tasks: prediction of transcription factors that play a role in
regulating a set of co-regulated genes; prediction of regulatory regions; and predictions of new target genes of a TRGM.
It is important to appreciate that the accuracy of predictions
differs between those tasks. Although exact performance statistics can only be obtained through careful experimental
testing of our predictions, which is outside the scope of the
present study, the results we obtained in this work can be
used to provide rough estimates of the predictive accuracy.
When we applied ModuleMiner to the two well studied
benchmark sets, we obtained HNF1, CEBP, HNF3, GATA1,
PAX6 and HNF4 for the liver benchmark set; and MZF1,
PPARγ, SRF, MEF2, the Epstein-Barr virus transcription
factor R, MYF, and MYOD for the muscle benchmark set.
Comparing this with the literature [4,46] and with the PWM
libraries we use, we obtain a sensitivity of 70% (7/10 known
PWMs are recovered), a specificity of 99.6% (630/633 [liver]
and 619/621 [muscle] probably incorrect PWMs are rejected),
and a positive predictive power of 62% (8/13 total predicted
PWMs are correct). These values need to be regarded with
some reservations when extrapolating to other cases, because
both liver and muscle are well studied systems for which highquality PWMs are available. Nevertheless, we can conclude
that ModuleMiner is quite accurate in selecting PWMs/transcription factors that play a key role in regulating the genes
under study.
Regarding detection of regulatory sequences, ModuleMiner
was able to detect 16 out of 24 known muscle/liver enhancers,
when a total of 24 predictions were made. This repesents a
sensitivity of 67% and a positive predictive power of 67%,
although we emphasize that this last value is an underestimate because some of our predictions may be yet unknown

Volume 9, Issue 4, Article R66

Van Loo et al. R66.13

Regarding the predictive accuracy of ModuleMiner for the
detection of new target genes given a TRGM, the results of our
LOOCV procedure can provide some estimates. From the
resulting ROC curves, one can see that for a sensitivity of
50%, the specificity is about 90%, and for a sensitivity of 80%
the specificity is about 80%, although the differences between
different gene sets can be large. However, typically only a few
dozen new target genes can be tested, and thus specificity may
not be high enough to select the right targets from the complete genome. In our previous study [23] we confirmed that
the predictive accuracy of new target genes is quite low,
although we showed it to be detectably present. We note that
in that study we used our previous ModuleSearcher algorithm, which was shown here to have lower performance than
ModuleMiner. In addition, ModuleMiner's use of network
level conservation between human-mouse and rat-dog predictions of new target genes might increase performance.
Finally, the results we obtained in the TSS distribution of the
CRMs predicted near to the new target genes are consistent
with these performance predictions; Figures 5e and 5h show
a similar trend to that in Figures 5d and 5g but to a lesser
extent, hence pointing to a substantial amount of noise, but
also indicating that a signal can be picked up even in a wholegenome scan.

Conclusion

We present ModuleMiner, the first algorithm to detect CRMs
in the human genome that is based on whole-genome optimization. ModuleMiner is generally applicable and outperforms
other similar approaches to detecting CRMs on benchmark
data. In addition, ModuleMiner can detect similar CRMs in
noisy sets of co-expressed genes, such as microarray clusters.
We successfully applied the algorithm to sets of genes
expressed in adult tissues and sets of genes expressed in
embryonic development processes. We show that CRMs predicted to regulate genes expressed in adult tissues are highly
over-represented within 200 base pairs of the TSS, whereas
CRMs predicted to regulate genes involved in embryonic
development processes are depleted within this region. These
findings suggest that expression in adult tissues is mainly
directed by proximal promoters, whereas expression in
embryonic development is more often regulated by distal
enhancers.

Materials and methods
Construction of three sets of candidate TFBSs
We constructed three sets of genome-wide candidate TFBSs
in human-mouse CNSs. The first set contains all predicted
binding sites in all CNSs. Sequences 10 kb 5' (+ 50 base pairs

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R66

3') of the TSS of all human genes and their mouse orthologs
were obtained from Ensembl (version 36). When another
gene was encountered, only the sequence up to that gene was
included. CNSs were selected by LAGAN alignments [47].
Thresholds were set at 75% conservation over at least 100
base pairs. TFBS predictions were performed using MotifScanner [48], with the prior set at 0.2. Both TRANSFAC [49]
(version 9.4) and JASPAR [39] were used as PWM libraries.

coworkers [20]. A TRM may contain multiple instances of one
specific PWM. In the calculation of Sseq, each PWM in the
TRM is matched to at most one binding site; thus, if a PWM
occurs twice, up to two binding sites for the corresponding
transcription factor can be taken into account. We assign a
score Sg to a gene by taking the maximum of Sseq for all CNSs
of that gene. The Sg scores for the given set of co-regulated
genes are used to determine a 'fitness score' of a TRM. This
fitness score of a TRM for a given set of co-expressed genes is
determined by the positions of the co-expressed genes in a
ranking of Sg for all genes in the genome. We use order statistics to assign a probability to the combination of ranks of the
given co-expressed genes (using the numerical approach
detailed in the report by Aerts and coworkers [23]). Hence,
the resulting P value represents how well that TRM models
the given set of co-expressed genes, compared with all other
genes in the genome. We use 1 minus that P value as the fitness score for the TRM.

The second set aims to restrict the candidate binding sites by
enforcing that the regulatory factors should be conserved.
This is achieved by selecting only binding sites in each human
region for transcription factors for which we also detect binding sites in the orthologous mouse region (preserved sites).
We note that this constraint does not require the binding sites
to be conserved or that they should align.
In the construction of the third set we aimed to correct for differences in human and mouse TSSs, and for possible annotation errors of TSSs. To this end, we extended the mouse
sequences used in the alignments by 100 kb in both directions. Alignment errors were kept in check by applying a
multi-step alignment procedure. The human 10 kb sequence
was aligned to the 10 kb mouse sequence (alignment A), the
mouse sequence extended by 10 kb in both directions
(alignment B), and the mouse sequence extended by 100 kb in
both directions (alignment C). If CNSs were predicted in
alignment A, then we assumed that the correct orthologous
region in the mouse is not off by more then 10 kb, and hence
we used the CNSs from alignment A supplemented by all
additional CNSs from alignment B. CNSs that were truncated
in alignment A because they extended over the sequence borders were replaced by their counterpart from alignment B. If
no CNSs were predicted in alignment A, then we reasoned
that the correct orthologous region in the mouse might be off
by more then 10 kb, and we used the CNSs from alignment C.
Here also, for each CNS (in human) we selected only preserved binding sites.
The same procedure was used with the dog and rat sequences
to create sets of candidate TFBSs corresponding to the three
human-mouse sets. Because neither dog nor rat could serve
as a reference species, we did not extend the sequences in the
dog-rat candidate TFBS set that corresponds to humanmouse set 3.

Transcriptional regulatory models
We model similar CRMs in a set of co-expressed genes by
TRMs. These TRMs are parameterized as in the report by
Aerts and coworkers [20]. A TRM is a combination of PWM
instances (up to six), supplemented by three parameters: the
maximum length of CRMs; a Boolean parameter stating
whether different binding sites can overlap or not; and a
Boolean parameter that indicates whether incomplete modules will be penalized. Given a TRM and a sequence, a score
Sseq can be calculated, as detailed in the report by Aerts and

Volume 9, Issue 4, Article R66

The ModuleMiner algorithm
ModuleMiner uses a genetic algorithm to find the TRM with
the optimal fitness score. At the onset, a starting population
of TRMs is obtained by running our ModuleSearcher algorithm [29] using many different combinations of parameters.
This initial step is not absolutely required (one can start from
a population of randomly generated CRMs), but it provides a
speed advantage. These TRMs obtained by ModuleSearcher
are assigned a fitness score, and the 200 best scoring TRMs
are retained as starting population for the ModuleMiner
genetic algorithm. During each 'generation' of the algorithm,
200 new individuals (TRMs) are generated (based on the
TRM population at that time) and added to the population.
This population of 400 TRM is then required to compete (by
fitness score), and the 200 best scoring TRMs are retained.
This procedure is repeated until the stop criterion is reached
(at least 300 generations and at most 1,000 generations).
Generation of new individuals (TRMs) is done using two 'parent' TRMs randomly selected from the population. Each of
the TRM parameters (number of PWMs, length, overlap, and
penalization) is determined by random selection from both
parents, allowing a small probability of mutation (each
parameter is set to a random value with a probability of 0.1).
Subsequently, PWMs are selected at random from both
parents. Here also, each PWM can be 'mutated' (replaced by
a PWM randomly selected from TRANSFAC and JASPAR)
with a probability of 0.1. As the stop criterion, we use
homogeneity of the population: if more than 80% of the
TRMs can be grouped into one TRGM (see below) and at least
300 generations have passed, then the algorithm is stopped.
If this stop criterion is not reached, then the algorithm is
stopped after 1,000 generations. The parameters of the ModuleMiner genetic algorithm (for example, population size,
mutation probability, and so on) were selected by optimizing
for speed. The convergence of the algorithm is highly insensitive to these parameters over a wide range, and sensitivity of

speed to these parameter settings is also limited (data not
shown).

Transcriptional regulatory global models
Aiming to minimize the sensitivity of our models of similar
CRMs to noise in TFBS predictions, we constructed composite models (TRGMs) from multiple high-scoring TRMs. To
this end, similar TRMs are clustered, and the largest cluster is
returned as resulting TRGM. TRMs were clustered when the
CRMs they predict near to the high scoring genes (out of the
given set of co-expressed genes) occur in the same CNS. As a
cut-off for determining which genes are among the 'high scoring genes', we used the top 2.5% in a ranking of the complete
genome.
Scoring a sequence with a TRGM is performed by scoring this
sequence for each TRM within the TRGM, subsequently normalizing this score (maximum CNS score = 1), and finally
adding the normalized TRM scores.
Because a TRGM is a collection of TRMs and TRMs each contain a collection of PWM instances, TRGMs are also collections of PWMs. In addition, a weight can be assigned to each
PWM in the TRGM, quantifying the significance of the PWM
for the process under study. This weight of a PWM is calculated as follows: for each TRM in the TRGM, the number of
instances of that PWM is counted, and this number is averaged over all of the TRMs in the TRGM.

Performance comparison on benchmark data
Four benchmark datasets containing annotated regulatory
regions directing expression in a particular system were
selected from PAZAR [28]. We selected all human genes (or
human orthologs) from each of these 'boutiques'. The regulatory sequence search space was defined as all CNSs within 10
kb 5' of the TSS (as throughout our study). We used this
search space for all algorithms, except CREME [19], for which
only the online version was available that by default uses one
CNS within 1.5 kb of the TSS. Because the other CRM detection algorithms had multiple parameters (absent in ModuleMiner), these parameters were set to default options. For
the ModuleSearcher algorithm [29], we used the same
parameters as in the cell cycle case study reported [20]. For
CisModule [22] and EMCMODULE [30] we used the default
parameter settings. We used Clover [31] as follows; for each
PWM found to be over-represented, we constructed a TRM
(with parameters; no overlap between binding sites, no
penalization, and a maximum distance of 1,000 base pairs),
and this way we constructed TRGMs containing enriched
PWMs reported by Clover. We also generated 100 random
TRMs (combinations of three to six PWMs with randomly
generated parameters) and we used these to rank the genes of
each benchmark set, as a proxy for a method unable to detect
similar CRMs.
