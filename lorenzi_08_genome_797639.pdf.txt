Abstract
Background: Identification and mapping of repetitive elements is a key step for accurate gene
prediction and overall structural annotation of genomes. During the assembly and annotation of
three highly repetitive amoeba genomes, Entamoeba histolytica, Entamoeba dispar, and Entamoeba
invadens, we performed comparative sequence analysis to identify and map all class I and class II
transposable elements in their sequences.
Results: Here, we report the identification of two novel Entamoeba-specific repeats: ERE1 and
ERE2; ERE1 is spread across the three genomes and associated with different repeats in a speciesspecific manner, while ERE2 is unique to E. histolytica. We also report the identification of two novel
subfamilies of LINE and SINE retrotransposons in E. dispar and provide evidence for how the
different LINE and SINE subfamilies evolved in these species. Additionally, we found a putative
transposase-coding gene in E. histolytica and E. dispar related to the mariner transposon Hydargos
from E. invadens. The distribution of transposable elements in these genomes is markedly skewed
with a tendency of forming clusters. More than 70% of the three genomes have a repeat density
below their corresponding average value indicating that transposable elements are not evenly
distributed. We show that repeats and repeat-clusters are found at syntenic break points between
E. histolytica and E. dispar and hence, could work as recombination hot spots promoting genome
rearrangements.
Conclusion: The mapping of all transposable elements found in these parasites shows that repeat
coverage is up to three times higher than previously reported. LINE, ERE1 and mariner elements
were present in the common ancestor to the three Entamoeba species while ERE2 was likely
acquired by E. histolytica after its separation from E. dispar. We demonstrate that E. histolytica and
E. dispar share their entire repertoire of LINE and SINE retrotransposons and that Eh_SINE3/
Ed_SINE1 originated as a chimeric SINE from Eh/Ed_SINE2 and Eh_SINE1/Ed_SINE3. Our work
shows that transposable elements are organized in clusters, frequently found at syntenic break
points providing insights into their contribution to chromosome instability and therefore, to
genomic variation and speciation in these parasites.

Background
Entamoeba species comprise a group of unicellular
eukaryotes that include parasitic organisms that infect
humans. In particular, E. histolytica is the etiological
agent responsible for amoebic dysentery and liver
abscess leading to the death of hundreds of thousands
of people annually. E. dispar, a closely related nonpathogenic species, is morphologically identical to
E. histolytica but with very different pathogenic properties
[1]. Both species are able to colonize humans but only
E. histolytica is able to cause invasive disease. Behavior
such as tissue damage and erythrophagocytosis is not
seen with E. dispar in vivo. E. invadens is a reptilian
parasite used as a model of encystation for E. histolytica,
as E. invadens will form cysts in axenic cultures.
E. invadens affects several reptile taxons, causing disease in
squamates (scaled reptilians), and also causing significant
morbidity and mortality in chelonians (turtles).
Recently, new efforts have been made to improve the
current E. histolytica genome assembly and annotation, and
to complete the genome sequences for E. dispar and
E. invadens. For this purpose, and in order to generate
accurate gene predictions and annotation, a detail identification of repeat elements in the genome is fundamental.
Several families of transposable elements (TEs) have been
described for the nuclear genome of these parasites [2-5]. It
is well established that transposable elements play an
important role in nuclear architecture, genome stability,
gene amplification, and altered gene regulation [6-8]. In
addition, as mentioned above, identification of repeat
elements is essential for correct gene set generation, since
unidentified TEs can affect the quality of gene annotation
and annotation-dependent analyses such as microarraybased gene expression studies [9]. For this reason, our
initial goal was to identify and map all the TEs that
populate these three Entamoeba genomes.
TEs are conventionally classified into two broad classes, I
and II. Class I includes two distinct types of TEs, long
terminal repeats (LTR) and non-LTR retroelements, both
requiring reverse transcription from an RNA intermediate. LTR retroelements include retroviruses and Ty1/Ty3like retrotransposons, and are reverse transcribed from
RNA intermediates, duplicated, and then transposed as
double-stranded DNA. Non-LTR retroelements consist of
short or long interspersed nuclear elements, respectively
SINEs or LINEs [10, 11], and are transposed by reverse
transcription of mRNA directly into the site of integration. On the other hand, class II TEs comprise elements
that transpose DNA (transposons).
Even though TEs can represent a large fraction of the
nuclear genome of multicellular organisms [6, 8], it is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/595

only recently that we have a wealth of finished genome
information from unicellular eukaryotes to expand the
knowledge about the presence of TEs in protozoan
parasites such as Entamoeba spp. Recent reports have
identified three different subfamilies of LINE and SINE
elements and a mutator-related DNA transposon in
E. histolytica; a single family of LINEs, SINEs, and mutator
transposons in E. dispar; and a single LINE family and
four types of class II TEs related to transposon superfamilies Ty1/mariner, mutator, piggyBac, and hAT in
E. invadens [2-5].
The reassembly and reannotation of the E. histolytica
nuclear genome and the completion (5×) of the E. dispar
and E. invadens genome sequences provided us with the
necessary framework to perform a survey of the currently
known Entamoeba transposable elements, and gave us
the opportunity to discover previously uncharacterized
novel repetitive sequences. We have mapped all known
class I and class II transposons in these genomes,
revealing that the collection of shared TEs and the
abundance of repetitive sequences are much larger than
what was previously reported [2]. In addition, we report
the identification and characterization of two novel TEs,
one of which is specific for E. histolytica. The present
study provides insights into the evolution and diversity
of transposable elements in these parasites and the role
they could have played during genomic variation and
speciation.

Methods
Repeat sequences accessions
Examples of the transposable element sequences from
E. histolytica, E. dispar and E. invadens described here have
been submitted to GenBank and can be searched under
the following accession numbers: Ed_LINE2, EU099436;
Ed_SINE2, EU099437; Ed_LINE3, EU099438; Ed_ERE1,
EU099439; Ed_SINE3, EU099440; Ed_Hydargos
(Ed_mariner in this paper), EU099441; Eh_ERE1,
EU099442; Eh_Hydargos (Eh_mariner in this paper),
EU099443; EhERE2, EU099444; Ei_ERE1, EU099445;
Ei_LINE, EU099446. Consensus sequences for Eh_ERE1,
Ed_ERE1, Ei_ERE1, Eh_ERE2, Ed_LINE2 and Ed_SINE2
elements were also submitted to RepBase together with
two representative sequences for Ed_SINE3 and
Ed_LINE3.
Genome sequence (data mining)
The genome sequencing for the three Entamoeba species
were performed in collaboration between the J. Craig
Venter Institute, JCVI (formerly The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR)) and the Sanger Institute. The draft
genome for E. histolytica was initially published by Loftus

et al [12], and was re-assembled and re-annotated at JCVI
(manuscript in preparation). The genomes of E. dispar
and E. invadens have been assembled and annotated at
JCVI. The new assemblies for E. histolytica
(AAFB00000000), E. dispar (AANV00000000) and
E. invadens (AANW00000000) have been deposited in
GenBank and can be searched through the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) web site
http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.

Repeat finders analysis
Several elements have been already characterized in
these organisms (Table 1). To survey the genomes, we
created a comprehensive custom database containing all
reported Entamoeba elements from GenBank and
Repbase [13] and ran RepeatMasker http://www.repeatmasker.org/ to map and quantify the elements. To
identify novel repeats we followed two different strategies. The first was to generate a library of highly
repetitive sequences for each genome using RepeatScout
http://repeatscout.bioprojects.org/[14]. Output
sequences encoding known proteins or PFAM domains
were filtered out. The remaining repeats were surveyed
for class I and class II transposable elements with
TransposonPSI http://transposonpsi.sf.net, a program
that performs PSI-BLAST searches using a set of position
specific scoring matrices generated from different collections of TE families. The second strategy was to perform
all-versus-all genome sequence alignments using nucmer
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mummer followed by
sequence clustering based on similarity. Clusters containing most repetitive sequences were subsequently
selected for further analysis.

Finally, consensus DNA sequences for each repetitive
element identified with either methodology were built
from multiple sequence alignments with ClustalX [15].
Extensive manual examination of repeat structures and
insertion sites was required for novel elements. Putative
ORFs identified with ORF finder http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html were conceptually translated.
Non-synonymous/synonymous substitution rate
(Dn/Ds ratio)
For a group of repeats containing conserved but noncoding sequences, it is expected no selection at the codon
level. To verify the coding capacity of ORFs identified in
ERE1 and ERE2 we computed the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (ω) [16, 17] on the
DNA sequence containing the ORF of interest. For proteins
under purifying selection it is expected a ω << 1 while for
proteins under strong positive selection the value should
be ω >> 1. A ω value close to 1 is an indication that
sequences are under no selective pressure and therefore are
unlikely to encode proteins [18, 19]. To calculate ω,
sequences were first aligned using MUSCLE [18] and the
program codeml from PAML [19, 20] was run using model
M0 to calculate the overall (i.e. branch- and positionindependent) ω value for the ORF of interest.
Phylogenetic analysis
Multiple sequence alignments for the different TE
families were constructed using ClustalX followed by
manual curation when necessary. Next, phylogenetic
trees were built by the Neighbor-Joining method using a
bootstrap value of 1000. Finally, trees were plotted with
TreeView http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html.

Genome coverage, repeat density and distribution
Genome coverage and copy number estimations for each
element were calculated by alignment of each repeat to
the assembled genomes using RepeatMasker. Partial
contiguous RepeatMasker hits derived from the same
TE were counted as a single repeat if they were ordered
with respect to the element and mapped less than 100 bp
apart from each other. Repeat coverage was estimated
with respect to the total length of the respective
genomes. Distribution of repeats was analyzed using
an in-house Perl script to estimate the frequency and
composition of different repeat clusters along the
genomes. Repeat densities were estimated per scaffold
using the following equation:

d repeats =

n×10000
length

where δ represents repeat density expressed as number of
repeats every 10 Kb, n is the number of repeats per
scaffold and length is the scaffold length in base pairs.
Identity- and dot-plots
Construction of identity plots for syntenic regions
between E. histolytica and E. dispar were generated using
the PipMaker web resource [21]. Dot-plots analyses were
performed with dotter [22] using a cutoff value of 60
identical nucleotides every 100 bp.

Results
Identification of Entamoeba Repetitive Element 1 (ERE1),
a novel repetitive element of Entamoeba sp
To identify all the repetitive elements present in the
E. histolytica genome, 1499 scaffolds from the current
genomic sequence data were surveyed using RepeatScout
or an all-versus-all comparison approach as described in
Methods. In a preliminary screening, all known elements
and new repetitive sequences above 400 bp were selected
for further analysis. Among this collection of repetitive
sequences we identified several truncated copies of an
AT-rich (82%) repeat that was named ERE1 (Eh_ERE1).
To reconstruct the structure of an intact Eh_ERE1 we
performed multiple sequence alignments of fragmented
copies of the element using ClustalX. The resulting
consensus sequence showed that Eh_ERE1 is a 7,160 bp
TE composed of an inner 2,719 bp core region flanked
by two 2,221 bp terminal inverted repeats (TIR) (Fig.
1A). The core region contained a single open reading
frame (ORF) potentially coding for a 369 amino acids
protein with an average percent of identity of 72% at the
protein level among all Eh_ERE1 TEs. No homologue to
this protein was found in the GenBank non-redundant
protein database. However, sequence comparisons to the
NCBI clusters of orthologous groups of proteins http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/, a database that clusters

proteins based on their phylogenetic relationship,
showed a weak but consistent similarity (e-value < 9 ×
10-7) to proteins belonging to two different groups of
genes associated to DNA metabolism: chromosome
segregation ATPases (COG1196) and ATPases involved
in DNA repair (COG419).
Genome distribution analysis showed that Eh_ERE1 is
primarily inserted in AT-rich intergenic regions frequently nearby other repetitive elements (see below
and Fig. 8B); no instances were found where its
integration disrupted a protein-coding gene. Estimation
of Eh_ERE1 copy number with RepeatMasker showed
that there are 777 fragmented copies of Eh_ERE1
scattered along the E. histolytica genome spanning a
total of 1 Mb bp of genomic sequence. This estimation
includes 100 putative complete elements where truncations coincide with the end of scaffolds (Table 2).
BLAST searches against the genomes of E. dispar and
E. invadens revealed that ERE1 is also present in these two
species, although the overall structural organization of
the elements differs from that in E. histolytica. In E. dispar,
ERE1 (Ed_ERE1) is a 3,216 bp element composed of a
central 2075 bp region containing a putative ORF and
flanked by two inverted Ed_SINE1 sequences. The ORF
encodes a 366 aa protein 81% identical at the amino
acid level to the one from the consensus Eh_ERE1
(Fig. 1B). It is interesting to note that although in
E. histolytica Eh_ERE1 is flanked by a different type of
TIR, the single copy of Ed_SINE1 identified so far in
E. histolytica (Eh_SINE3) [2, 5] is inserted next to a
truncated Eh_ERE1 element that carries the whole
coding sequence of the element, resembling the organization of Ed_ERE1 in E. dispar (see below and Fig. 8C).
Both, the central region of Ed_ERE1 and Ed_SINE1, were
found inserted alone throughout the E. dispar genome,
suggesting that at some point during evolution, these
two elements were able to transpose independently from
each other. Because the previous observation implies
that these two elements might be independent, Ed_ERE1
coverage and copy number were estimated independently from Ed_SINE1. We identified 587 copies of
Ed_ERE1 including 51 complete elements, spanning a
total of 526 Kb of genomic sequence (Table 2).
Similar analysis in E. invadens showed that ERE1
(Ei_ERE1) contains a single putative ORF coding for a
327 aa protein with 30% identity (48% similarity,
e-value = 2 × 10-31) to the putative Eh_ERE1 peptide
(Fig. 1B), but we could not find any large TIR flanking
the coding region. Due to the low degree of conservation
among Ei_ERE1 TEs, it was not possible to accurately
define the boundaries of the element. For this reason,
genomic distribution was estimated using the most

conserved portion of Ei_ERE1 represented by a 1,759 bp
DNA fragment spanning a single ORF. This approach
revealed that the genome of E. invadens contains 257
copies of Ei_ERE1, 30 of which are complete elements
(as defined above), spanning 170 Kb (0.4%) of genomic
sequence (Table 2).
To discard that the single gene found in ERE1 is not a
spurious ORF caused by the AT-rich composition of this
element we computed the ratio of non-synonymous to
synonymous substitutions (Dn/Ds) for this gene in each
species. If the ORFs were not functional or spurious it
would be expected to find a similar number of
synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions and
therefore, the Dn/Ds ratio (ω) should be close to 1. In
the three cases the omega value was significantly lower
than 1 (ωEh_ERE1 = 0.49, ωEd_ERE1 = 0.49, ωEi_ERE1 = 0.47),
indicating that the gene coded by ERE1 is under
purifying selection.

Comparative sequence analysis between these genomes
revealed several syntenic regions between E. histolytica
and E. dispar where ERE1 was inserted in one genome
but not the other (Fig. 1C) supporting the hypothesis
that at some point in the evolution of these species ERE1
was able to transpose, although it is not clear whether it
is still active.

Identification of Entamoeba Repetitive Element 2 (ERE2),
a transposon-like element specific to E. histolytica
Further analysis of the E. histolytica genome led us to the
identification of a second 1,936 bp repetitive element
named ERE2 (Fig 2). Its consensus sequence consists of a
1,892 bp sequence flanked by two 22 bp imperfect TIRs
that are 82% identical (Fig. 2A and 2B). The internal
fragment contains a putative ORF coding for a 173 aa
polypeptide with no homology to any known protein.
However, estimation of the Dn/Ds ratio indicated that
this ORFs is under purifying selection (ωEh_ERE2 = 0.49)
strongly suggesting that it is a real protein coding gene.

many copies of Eh_ERE2 that are absent in the
corresponding syntenic regions from E. dispar supporting
the hypothesis that Eh_ERE2 is a transposable element
(Fig. 2C). HoHA closer examination of the ERE2
integration site indicated that the element inserts
preferentially into AT-rich intergenic regions (80% AT).
During transposition ERE2 generates 3–14 bp target site
duplications (TSD, Fig. 2B), but it does not seem to
recognize any specific targeting genomic sequence. We
quantified approximately 800 copies of ERE2 in the
E. histolytica genome, including 71 complete elements (at
least 90% of the consensus length), representing a total
genomic coverage of 734 Kb (3.5% of the E. histolytica
genome, Table 2). Contrary to Eh_ERE1, we could not
find any copy of ERE2 in the genomes of either E. dispar
or E. invadens, suggesting that E. histolytica acquired this
TE independently after diverging from E. dispar, its
closest relative.

Identification of mariner transposons in the genomes of
E. histolytica and E. dispar
Pritham et. al [3] reported the existence of five different
families of transposons belonging to the Tc1/mariner
superfamily in the genomes of E. invadens and
E. moshkovskii (Table 1), suggesting that these TEs were
already present in the common ancestor of the three
Entamoeba species in this study. However, no such
transposons have been identified in E. histolytica and
E. dispar, raising the question whether E. invadens and
E. moshkovskii acquired these mariner transposons by
horizontal transfer or vertically from the common
ancestor. To address this issue we used Transposon-PSI,
an analysis tool developed in-house to identify
sequences homologous to large and diverse families of
transposable elements (see Methods) to look for marinerrelated sequences in the genomes of E. histolytica and
E. dispar. The program identified two genomic regions,
one from each organism, that gave a highly significant
hit (e-value < 1 × 10-14) against a mariner transposase
from Drosophila melanogaster (gi1006789 in Fig. 3A).
Both regions contained an ORF coding for a 335 aa and a
336 aa protein in E. histolytica (Eh_mariner) and E. dispar
(Ed_mariner) respectively. These putative proteins
shared 95% identity throughout their entire sequence
suggesting that they could correspond to the same locus
in both genomes. Further comparative analyses of a 20
Kb genomic region encompassing these ORFs confirmed
that Eh_mariner and Ed_mariner were syntenic (data not
shown). Unfortunately, it was not possible to determine
the precise boundary of the elements due to the short
nature of the mariner TIRs (less than 50 bp) [3].

BLASTP searches revealed that Eh_mariner and Ed_mariner
were closely related to Hydargos (e-value < 4 × 10-15), an

E. invadens transposon that belongs to the Tc1/mariner
superfamily [3]. This was further confirmed by phylogenetic
analysis using the Neighbor-Joining method (bootstrap
value = 961/1000, Fig. 3A). As expected, Eh_mariner and
Ed_mariner coding proteins contained a D,D33D motif,
typical of this type of transposase (Fig. 3B).
Evolutionary study of LINE elements in E. histolytica,
E. dispar and E. invadens
Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of
several families of non-LTR retrotransposons related to
the R2 group of LINE elements in the genomes of
E. histolytica (Eh_LINE1, Eh_LINE2, Eh_LINE3)[2, 4],
E. dispar (Ed_LINE1)[4, 5] and E. invadens (Ei_LINE)[3].
However, to our knowledge, there is no current analysis
of how these Entamoeba TEs are related to each other. To
better understand the evolutionary history of these
retrotransposons we mapped all the LINE elements in
the three genomes and studied their relationship based
on phylogenetic analysis (see Methods). This approach
led to the identification of two additional LINE
subfamilies in the genome of E. dispar. The first element,
named Ed_LINE2, shares 86% nucleotide similarity with
Eh_LINE2 of E. histolytica. Ed_LINE2 integrates into
AT-rich intergenic regions generating TSDs at both ends
of the element. The consensus Ed_LINE2 is a 4,735 bp TE
that contains a putative 5' ORF coding for a 480 aa
protein of unknown function and a second ORF that
encodes a 956 aa reverse transcriptase protein with a
C-terminal domain containing a nucleic acid binding
site and a nuclease motif [2]. All the elements identified
to date contain multiple stop codons interrupting at least
one of the two ORFs suggesting there are no functional
copies of Ed_LINE2 in E. dispar. The second element,
Ed_LINE3, is a 4,406 bp sequence that shares more than
70% identity at the nucleotide level with Eh_LINE3.
Contrary to Ed_LINE2, Ed_LINE3 termini are poorly
conserved and therefore no flanking TSD could be
identified. These results suggest that LINE2 and LINE3
subfamilies were already present in the common
ancestor to E. histolytica and E. dispar.

Characterization of the single LINE element previously
identified in E. invadens [3] indicated that Ei_LINE is a
5,043 bp sequence flanked by TSDs (Fig. 4A). Only two
complete copies of Ei_LINE were found in E. invadens
and neither of them had a complete ORF coding for a
reverse transcriptase protein.
Phylogenetic analysis based on manual reconstruction of
the reverse transcriptase consensus sequence indicated
that all LINEs found in the three Entamoeba species were
derived from a single ancestral sequence that was already
present before they diverged from each other (Fig. 4B).

Identification of an E. histolytica Eh_SINE2-like element
in the genome of E. dispar
The genomes of E. histolytica and E. dispar share most of
their LINE and SINE families as indicated above [2, 3, 5].
Indeed, E. histolytica LINE1-3 have their counterparts in
E. dispar: Ed_LINE1[2], and Ed_LINE2- and Ed_LINE3like sequences (this report); while E. dispar Ed_SINE1 is
equivalent to E. histolytica Eh_SINE3 and closely related
to Eh_SINE1. However, to date there is no evidence
pointing to the existence of an element equivalent to
Eh_SINE2 in E. dispar. To verify this observation, we
performed BLASTN searches of the E. dispar genome with
Eh_SINE2 identifying a 604 bp element (Ed_SINE2)
68% identical at the nucleotide level to Eh_SINE2. A
multiple sequence alignment of these two elements
showed a high degree of conservation at the 5' and 3'
ends while the central regions were more divergent. We
mapped a total of 189 copies of Ed_SINE2 in E. dispar
including 53 complete elements (Table 2). These results
indicate that all the non-autonomous SINE elements
together with the three LINE subfamilies already existed
in the common ancestor before the speciation process
that gave rise to E. histolytica and E. dispar.

AANW02001294 (486–1,665), AANW02001046 (2,7581,949) and AANW02001402 (3,418-2,447). GenBank

values below 500; bold grey lines, branches containing bootstrap
values between 500 and 750; bold black lines, branches
supported by bootstrap values above 750. Nodes containing
Entamoeba LINEs are highlighted in blue.

At a later point in evolution, in the ancestral line that led
to E. histolytica and E. dispar, LINE TEs split into two
separate lineages giving rise to the Eh/Ed_LINE1 and Eh/
Ed_LINE2 subfamilies. Subsequently, in this same
ancestor, a third LINE subfamily diverged from LINE1
giving origin to Eh_LINE3 in E. histolytica and Ed_LINE3
in E. dispar (Fig. 4B).

Origin of Ed_SINE1/Eh_SINE3 in the genomes of
E. dispar and E. histolytica
Shire et al [5] identified Ed_SINE1 in the genome of
E. dispar, a SINE element homologous to the single copy
of Eh_SINE3 found in E. histolytica [2, 5]. Nevertheless,
the origin of Ed_SINE1/Eh_SINE3 is not clear. To
elucidate this issue, we performed dot-plot alignments
of Ed_SINE1/Eh_SINE3 against Eh_SINE1 and
Eh_SINE2. This analysis showed that the 5' end of
Ed_SINE1/Eh_SINE3 is more similar to Eh_SINE2
whereas it's 3' end resembles Eh_SINE1 (Fig. 5A and
5B). This result was subsequently confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using either the first (Fig. 5C) or last
(Fig. 5D) 240 bp of these elements together with similar
fragments from Eh_LINE1 and Eh_LINE2. This study
suggests that in the common ancestor of E. histolytica and
E. dispar, Ed_SINE1/Eh_SINE3 originated as a chimeric
element; its 5' end derived from the precursor sequence
of Eh_SINE2/Ed_SINE2 (bootstrap = 992/1000) and its
3' end originated from an ancestral Eh_SINE1-like
element (bootstrap = 910/1000) (Fig 5C and 5D). If
this is the case, then there should be some evidence in E.
dispar indicating that such ancestral Eh_SINE1-like
elements existed in the common ancestor of these two
parasites. A survey of the E. dispar genome with the
sequence from Eh_SINE1 revealed the existence of a 579
bp element with more than 83% identity to Eh_SINE1
(Fig. 6A). This element was interrupted by the insertion
of an Ed_SINE2 77 bp from its 5' end generating 21 bp
duplications of part of the Eh_SINE1-like sequence at

either side of the integration site. Manual reconstruction
of the original element, followed by phylogenetic
analysis, confirmed that this sequence was closely related
to Eh_SINE1 (bootstrap value = 1000/1000; Fig. 6B) and
was named Ed_SINE3. The fact that we found only two
full-length copies of Ed_SINE3 in E. dispar suggests that
this element is no longer functional and the remaining
copies are just "fossil" sequences derived from a
previously active element in the E. histolytica and E.
dispar ancestral genome.
Our repeat survey identified several additional copies of
Eh_SINE3 scattered along the E. histolytica genome
(Table 2). Comparative sequence analysis of regions
containing Eh_SINE3 elements in E. histolytica showed
many cases where their syntenic counterparts in E. dispar

lacked an Ed_SINE1 inserted in an equivalent position,
demonstrating that Eh_SINE3 was able to transpose in
E. histolytica after its separation from E. dispar. Moreover,
we found one case where two Eh_SINE3 elements were
99% identical suggesting that the element could be still
active.
Altogether, the analysis described above suggests that the
pair Ed_SINE1/Eh_SINE3 originated as a chimeric
element in the common ancestor of E. histolytica and
E. dispar and was subsequently amplified in E. histolytica
and, more successfully, in E. dispar associated with
Ed_ERE1 and Ed_LINE1 or as an independent repeat.
Representation of transposable elements in
Entamoeba sp
In a recent comparative analysis of the distribution of
LINE and SINE elements in E. histolytica, Bakre et al. [2]
reported that TEs account for just 6% of this genome.
However, that estimation was based on a previous draft
of the E. histolytica assembly and did not include other
TEs identified in this paper. Similarly, Pritham et al [3]
reported a quantification of TEs for E. histolytica,
E. dispar, and E. invadens based solely on BLAST hits to
unassembled reads from the Sanger database. To
estimate the abundance of TEs in the current
E. histolytica, E. dispar and E. invadens genome assemblies
we map all TEs identified to date in these three genomes

Consistent with previous reports [2, 3], we identified a
lower representation of LINE and SINE elements in the
genomes of E. dispar (1.7 Mb) and E. invadens (59.3 Kb).
All the LINEs identified in the three genomes have one or
more in-frame stop codons or frame-shifts interrupting
at least one of their putative protein coding genes.
However, since sequence coverage for E. dispar and
E. invadens is 5X, we cannot rule out that some of these
mutations are artifacts caused by sequencing errors.

(Table 2). Eh_LINE1 constitutes the largest family of TEs
in E. histolytica with a total of 742 elements, including 88
complete copies and 46 putative complete elements,
truncated due to their location at the end of assemblies.
Similarly, Ed_LINE1 is the most frequent LINE in

putative complete elements that map at the end of
assemblies (Table 2).

Distribution of transposable elements in Entamoeba sp
To investigate the distribution of TEs in the three species
we plotted the frequency of all inter-repeat distances for
each genome using 100 bp bins (Fig. 7A). This analysis
showed that inter-repeat distances follow a right-skewed
distribution with a median value significantly lower than
the mean distance indicating that, in the three Entamoebas, TEs tend to be clustered instead of evenly distributed
along the genomes. E. histolytica has the most compactly
clustered repeats with 50% of the TEs separated by less
than 390 bp while median distance values for E. dispar
and E. invadens are 1136 bp and 1634 bp, respectively
(Fig. 7A). To determine the composition of repeatclusters we quantified the number of times all possible
pairs of repeats belonged to the same repeat-cluster,
defining as repeat-cluster a series of repeats separated by
up to 250 bp (Fig. 7B). This quantification showed that
in E. histolytica Eh_ERE1 is the element most frequently
found in the clusters (467 copies) followed by Eh_LINE1
(363 copies) and Eh_ERE2 (336 copies). Most repeat-

A similar cross-species distribution was found for ERE1,
which is more abundant in E. histolytica (1 Mb, 777
copies) followed by E. dispar (0.5 Mb, 587 copies) and
E. invadens (0.1 Mb, 257 copies; Table 2). On the other
hand, estimation of transposon coverage showed the
opposite situation. Indeed, DNA transposons spanned a
total of 3.8 Mb of the E. invadens genome, while just a
few copies of class II elements were found in E. histolytica
and E. dispar (Table 2). This distributional bias observed
across the three Entamoeba species analyzed in this study
confirmed previous quantification results performed on
unassembled genomic sequences [3].

Further investigation of the numerous interactions
between Ed_ERE1, Ed_LINE1 and Ed_SINE1 showed
that in E. dispar the genomic region syntenic to the
E. histolytica locus containing the single reported copy of
Eh_SINE3 (assemblies DS571167 and DS548606 in Fig.
7C)[2, 5] displays a similar repeat organization containing an Ed_SINE1 in-between an Ed_LINE1 and an
Ed_ERE1 elements (Fig. 7C). This three-component
structure is found amplified 26 times in the genome of
E. dispar and seen even more frequently is a twocomponent unit composed of an Ed_SINE1 linked to
either Ed_ERE1 or Ed_LINE1 (43 and 22 copies
respectively).
An analysis of TE dispersion along the scaffolds revealed
that 90% of the genomic sequence in E. histolytica has a
repeat density of less than 4 repeats every 10 Kb, the
mean value for this genome (Fig. 8). A similar uneven
repeat density was observed for E. dispar and E. invadens,
where 75% or more of the genomic sequence has a TE
content below the average (Fig. 8). These results
demonstrate that repeats and repeat-clusters are not
uniformly distributed along these genomes but they are
enriched in relatively small genomic regions, while most
of the three genomes have a TE content below their
average density.

Discussion
In this work we report the first complete whole genome
survey of transposable elements for the newly generated
assemblies of E. histolytica, E. dispar, and E. invadens. This
analysis led to the identification of two novel Entamoebaspecific repetitive elements, ERE1 and ERE2, two LINE

and two SINE subfamilies in E. dispar, and a marinerrelated sequence in the genomes of E. histolytica and
E. dispar. We also found that TE representation in
E. histolytica is much higher than previously thought
(19.7% in this study versus 6% in [2]). A comparison
between repeat coverage in the old and new E. histolytica
assemblies revealed that both GenBank releases have
similar repeat contents (17.4% in the old assembly
versus 19.7% in the reassembled genomic sequence).
Therefore, the higher repeat coverage reported herein is
likely due to two main factors: the use of a more
sensitive algorithm to identify repetitive regions (RepeatMasker versus BLAST in [2]) and the discovery of two
novel TE families (ERE1 and ERE2) based on intra- and
inter-species sequence comparison.
Our analysis also confirms previous results showing that
the population of TEs in E. histolytica and E. dispar is
enriched in non-LTR retroelements while E. invadens
contains mostly class II transposons [2, 3, 5]. Despite
this bias, LINEs, ERE1s, and transposons from mariner
and mutator superfamilies were found in the three
genomes indicating they were already present in the
common ancestor rather than acquired horizontally after
the three species diverged from each other.
Among all the TEs reported in this work, ERE1 and ERE2
are the most intriguing. Both elements have features in
common such as a high AT content, the presence of a
single ORF, two TIRs delimiting their termini (except for
Ei_ERE1), and their integration into intergenic regions
(Fig. 1 and 2). Although their putative encoded proteins
have no significant hits against any known transposase,
their structure resembles that of DNA transposons. In
particular, ERE2 is flanked by two 19 bp imperfect TIRs
and generates TSDs similar to other known DNA
transposons such as Mutyl [23], Pat [24] and Gulliver
[25]. The ω values calculated for the ORFs found in ERE1
and ERE2 suggest that both genes are under purifying
selection and might still be functional. Moreover, we
have found E. histolytica EST evidence that suggests that
both Eh_ERE1 and Eh_ERE2 are transcribed in this
parasite. In addition, comparative sequence analysis
between the genomes of E. histolytica and E. dispar
shows many cases where both TEs are found inserted in
genomic loci from one Entamoeba genome but not in
their syntenic counterparts from the other species,
strongly supporting the idea that these two elements
were able to transpose at some point in evolution. Due
to its absence in other Entamoeba species studied in this
report, Eh_ERE2 seems to be the only TE in E. histolytica
that has been acquired by horizontal transfer.
Given the high degree of conservation between the
genomes of E. histolytica and its closely related

Page 11 of 15

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:595

non-pathogenic species E. dispar, it is important to ask
how E. histolytica causes disease. It is well established in
prokaryotic organisms that DNA repeats can mediate
genomic rearrangements that can alter the expression of
disease-associated genes [26]. For example, in pathogenic bacteria such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria
meningitidis, repeat-mediated rearrangements promote
positioning of cell surface genes next to "on switches",
causing otherwise silent genes to be expressed [27].
Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the acquisition
and posterior amplification of elements such as Eh_ERE2
in the genome of E. histolytica has played a role in
speciation and acquisition of pathogenicity traits promoting genome rearrangements or altering the function
or number of genes involved in processes such as cell
attachment, evasion of the host immune response, etc.
For example, it has been described that the leucine-rich/
BspA-like gene family, that codes for proteins that seem
to localize to the parasite plasma membrane and might
interact with the host fibronectin [28], is frequently
associated to TEs [2]. We have determined that 41 out of
114 of these genes are at less than 1 Kb of a repetitive
sequence (data not shown). Currently, we are carrying
out studies looking for additional gene families associated to TEs in E. histolytica.
Contrary to Eh_ERE2, ERE1 is present in the genomes of
the three Entamoeba species analyzed in this study and its
single ORF encodes a putative protein similar to
members from two NCBI COGs composed of proteins
associated with DNA repair and recombination. Considering both the structural features of this repetitive
element and the fact that the ERE1-encoded polypeptide
is similar to proteins involved in DNA metabolism, our
data suggest that ERE1 is likely a class II TE. Interestingly,
the coding region of ERE1 is associated with different
types of terminal repeats depending on the organism.
While in E. histolytica the ERE1 coding region is generally
flanked by the same 2,221 bp TIR, in E. dispar ERE1 is
often associated to other TEs, mainly Ed_SINE1, and to a
lesser extent Ed_LINE1 and Ed_SINE2. Therefore, it is
not clear whether Ed_ERE1 is able to transpose
independently or if it requires the presence of a nearby
repeat. Moreover, 47% of the Eh_ERE1 elements found
in E. histolytica map within repeat-clusters linked to other
TEs (Fig. 7B) and hence, it is possible that the significant
expansion of repeats in this parasite had also contributed
to the observed 34% increase in the number of Eh_ERE1
repeats compared to the frequency of Ed_ERE1 in the
E. dispar genome. Lastly, in E. invadens Ei_ERE1 is poorly
conserved and we were unable to identify any copy
associated to other repeats. Both the low copy number
and degree of conservation among Ei_ERE1s suggest that
this element is not longer functional in E. invadens.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/595

Our study also revealed that Eh_SINE3/Ed_SINE1 is a
chimeric element where the 5' end was derived from
Eh_SINE2/Ed_SINE2 and the 3' end from Eh_SINE1/
Ed_SINE3. In addition to the single Eh_SINE3 previously
reported for E. histolytica [2, 5], we could identify at least
9 intact and 40 truncated copies of the element in this
genome (Table 2). The identification of Eh_SINE3
elements integrated into E. histolytica loci without the
presence of a Ed_SINE1 in the corresponding syntenic
regions from E. dispar (data not shown) indicates that
Eh_SINE3 remained active in E. histolytica after its
separation from E. dispar.
Our analysis of the distribution of LINE and SINE
retrotransposons in the three Entamoeba genomes
demonstrates that all LINE elements derived from a
common ancestral TE related to the R2 group of LINEs
(Fig. 4B, bootstrap value = 926/1000). LINE elements
remained silent in the lineage that led to E. invadens, but
were very active in the ancestor of E. histolytica and
E. dispar, where gave rise to three different LINE and
SINE subfamilies. It is not clear whether these non-LTR
retroelements are currently active.
Although we identified no LINEs having an intact ORF1
and ORF2, there were some LINE1 and LINE2 elements
in E. histolytica and E. dispar with either a complete ORF1
or ORF2 coding for a putative protein with a reverse
transcriptase domain. It has been reported that LINE
elements with a non-functional mutation of its reverse
transcriptase gene are still able to transpose using the
proteins coded by a functional LINE element [29, 30].
Therefore, it is likely that these elements are still able to
transpose using the required replication machinery in
trans. Mapping of assembled ESTs onto the E. histolytica
genome using PASA (Program to Assemble Spliced
Alignments) [31], revealed that some copies of
Eh_SINE1 and Eh_SINE2 are actually transcribed, but
we found no evidence of expressed LINE genes. However, BLAST searches against unassembled E. histolytica
ESTs identified several ESTs that are at least 98%
identical to Eh_LINE1, Eh_LINE2 or Eh_LINE3 supporting the idea that LINEs might still be active in
E. histolytica.
A striking difference between E. invadens and the
genomes of E. histolytica and E. dispar is the compositional bias in their respective TE populations. Our results
confirmed previous studies [3] showing that in
E. invadens most of the collection of repetitive elements
is composed of class II transposons while the other two
species are rich in class I repeats. Since E. moshkovskii and
E. invadens have a similar set of DNA transposons,
Pritham et al [3] proposed that most of these repeats

The repeat survey of E. histolytica, E. dispar, and
E. invadens reveals a much higher representation of
repetitive elements than previously reported [3].
Although it is not clear whether TEs are playing a role
in amoeba fitness, it seems likely that the high coverage
of repetitive elements in E. histolytica (20%) could play a
part in the high frequency of genomic variation among
the parasite population. This could explain, in part, why
less than 25% of the E. histolytica infections cause disease
[32-35]. Moreover, this study demonstrates that in these
genomes transposable elements have a clustered distribution with more than 75% of the genome containing
a repeat density below the average, and a small portion
of the genome (less than 24%) containing a high repeat
density. Repeats and repeat-clusters might work as hot
spots for recombination promoting rearrangement
between chromosomes and contributing to genome
plasticity. Mukherjee et al. [36] have shown that
E. histolytica is able to change its DNA content and size
when switching between xenic and axenic conditions.
Although these changes seem to be mainly caused by
variations in the number of copies of the entire genome,
the authors propose that some specific regions could be
differentially amplified or deleted [36]. If that is the case,
then it seems plausible that repeats and repeat-clusters
may be playing a role in these processes.
During our comparative sequence analysis between
E. histolytica and E. dispar we identified many syntenic
break points rich in repetitive elements (Fig. 9) where
similarity disappears within TEs (gray vertical lines in
Fig. 9) suggesting that recombination occurred within
repetitive regions. Therefore, it is likely that the striking
enrichment of TEs in E. histolytica had contributed to its
divergence from E. dispar.
The combined approach using intra- and inter-species
comparative sequence analysis and TransposonPSI
searches based on position-specific scoring matrices
specific for different families of repetitive elements led

should have been present in the common ancestor and
not incorporated horizontally. Thus, there should be
some evidence for the previous existence of such
elements in the genomes of E. histolytica and E. dispar.
The results presented herein indicate that at least a
mariner family, related to the transposon Hydargos from
E. invadens, was present in the ancestral Entamoeba
genome that gave origin to the three species studied in
this work. The fact that E. histolytica and E. dispar only
have a single identifiable copy of a Hydargos-related
element and the low degree of conservation of the
residues surrounding the three catalytic aspartic acids of
its putative transposase (Fig. 3B) suggests that this TE is
not active.

to the identification of several novel TEs that had not
been detected in previous studies [2-5] and showed that
E. histolytica and E. dispar share most of their TE
repertoire with the exception of Eh_ERE2. Whether the
acquisition of Eh_ERE2 and/or the remarkable amplification of TEs contributed to E. histolytica pathogenicity
remains to be elucidated.

Conclusion
The present study provides the first insight into the
composition and genomic organization of transposable
elements for the newly generated assemblies of
E. histolytica, E. dispar and E. invadens. Our analysis
shows that the E. histolytica genome has three times more
transposable elements than previously reported (20% of
the genome and mean repeat density of 4 TEs every 10
Kb), and twice as much as its closest relative, E. dispar.
Transposable elements are not uniformly distributed but
have a tendency of being aggregated forming clusters.
Repeat-clusters are frequently found at syntenic break
points between E. histolytica and E. dispar, vouching for
the contribution of transposable elements to genome
instability and speciation. The expansion of LINE and
SINE retroelements in the common ancestor to
E. histolytica and E. dispar gave origin to three different
families of LINE and SINE elements. We also describe

two novel transposable elements, ERE1 and ERE2. ERE1
was present in the common ancestor of the three
Entamoebas but it was expanded in the linage that led
to E. histolytica and E. dispar, while ERE2 was acquired by
E. histolytica after its divergence from E. dispar. All
together the results presented in this study contribute
to a better understanding about the genome architecture
of these organisms and will help to clarify the processes
that might have contributed to genome variation and
speciation in these parasites, particularly between pathogenic E. histolytica and non-pathogenic E. dispar.
