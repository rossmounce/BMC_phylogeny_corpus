Abstract
Background: Influenza A virus genomes are comprised of 8 negative strand single-stranded RNA
segments and are thought to encode 11 proteins, which are all translated from mRNAs
complementary to the genomic strands. Although human, swine and avian influenza A viruses are
very similar, cross-species infections are usually limited. However, antigenic differences are
considerable and when viruses become established in a different host or if novel viruses are created
by re-assortment devastating pandemics may arise.
Results: Examination of influenza A virus genomes from the early 20th Century revealed the
association of a 167 codon ORF encoded by the genomic strand of segment 8 with human isolates.
Close to the timing of the 1948 pseudopandemic, a mutation occurred that resulted in the extension
of this ORF to 216 codons. Since 1948, this ORF has been almost totally maintained in human
influenza A viruses suggesting a selectable biological function. The discovery of cytotoxic T cells
responding to an epitope encoded by this ORF suggests that it is translated into protein. Evidence
of several other non-traditionally translated polypeptides in influenza A virus support the translation
of this genomic strand ORF. The gene product is predicted to have a signal sequence and two
transmembrane domains.
Conclusion: We hypothesize that the genomic strand of segment 8 of encodes a novel influenza
A virus protein. The persistence and conservation of this genomic strand ORF for almost a century
in human influenza A viruses provides strong evidence that it is translated into a polypeptide that
enhances viral fitness in the human host. This has important consequences for the interpretation
of experiments that utilize mutations in the NS1 and NEP genes of segment 8 and also for the
consideration of events that may alter the spread and/or pathogenesis of swine and avian influenza
A viruses in the human population.

Background
Influenza A viruses have had, and continue to have, an
extremely significant deleterious impact on human health
[1,2]. In spite of huge research efforts, the development/
deployment of vaccines and more recently anti-viral drugs
[3-6], the regular occurrence of global pandemics and
yearly epidemics generate levels of morbidity and mortal-

ity that unfortunately keep this virus among the "top"
human pathogens[7]. However, this research effort has
greatly expanded our understanding of influenza transmission [8-10], evolution [11] and pathogenesis [12-14].
Over the years, a large and valuable collection of influenza
A virus genomic sequences has been acquired at NCBI

[15] and BioHealthBase [16]. It has been mined extensively to correlate pathogenicity with RNA and encoded
protein sequences, revealing much about the processes of
antigenic shift and drift, the effect of which is that currently circulating influenza A virus may escape, to a
greater or lesser degree, the protective effect of our
immune system primed against a previous influenza A
infection or vaccination. More recently, the application of
new technologies to the problem has lead to determination of the genomic sequence of the infamous 1918 influenza A strain [17-19] and its subsequent reconstruction
into a viable virus. However, the precise origin of the 1918
pandemic virus is still not clear, nor why it was so virulent.
Our current understanding of the influenza A virus is that
it has a segmented (8 pieces) negative sense singlestranded RNA genome, which encodes 11 proteins[20].
Each genome segment is transcribed to produce a single
capped mRNA species, which in the case of segments 7
and 8 also undergoes splicing so that each encodes 2 proteins, M1/M2 and NS1/NEP respectively[21]. The segment encoding PB1, a polymerase subunit, also generates
an additional protein, PB1-F2, that is not translated from
the first AUG of the mRNA, rather the PB1-F2 peptide is
produced as a result of translation initiating at an alternate start codon in a different reading-frame to that used
for PB1 [22]. The PB1-F2 peptide is present in most, but
not all, influenza A virus isolates [23] and is an important
virulence factor [22,24-26]; presumably it has evolved secondarily to the PB1 polymerase gene. However, influenza
virulence is not tied to one or a few genes, there are multiple lines of evidence that most if not all of the influenza
A proteins contribute to the pathogenicity of the virus in
humans [18,27,28].
In this paper we provide multiple lines of evidence to support the hypothesis that a large Open Reading Frame
(ORF), present on the negative, genomic, strand of influenza A virus segment 8 encodes a protein that provides a
selective advantage to viruses that infect humans. As a
result of the evolutionary selective process, almost every
human influenza A virus isolated in the last 50 years possesses this ORF, excluding those that have recently been
acquired from avian or swine hosts. Although we are not
the first to observe this ORF, it has been rarely been commented upon by others. It was observed when segment 8
was first sequenced [29] and more recently, the ubiquity
of this ORF was briefly noted after we began this work
[30].

Results
Distribution of a large genomic strand ORF among
influenza A viruses
It should be noted that the characterization of influenza A
virus genomes was complicated by a variety of errors in

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/198

the available data sets. There are a number of minor and
major (those that break essential genes) sequencing errors
including contamination of virus materials that lead to a
number of mis-identified sequences [31]. Also, the convention of naming these viruses for the organism from
which they were isolated complicates their classification;
for example, many avian-derived H5N1 viruses are
labeled as "human". By necessity, we have therefore
excluded a small number of sequences that clearly contain
sequencing errors from this analysis.
While reviewing the genome sequence of the 1918 strain
of influenza A virus (Accession no. AF333238; A/
Brevig_Mission/1/18(H1N1)) for teaching purposes, one
of us (CU) noticed the presence of an ORF capable of
encoding 167 aa on the genomic (negative) strand of segment 8 (Figure 1). This struck us as being unusually large
and lead us to wonder if it might be encoding a polypeptide even though no process for 1) translation of genomic
RNAs or 2) generation of mRNAs with the same sequence
as genome strands has been proposed for influenza A
virus. A thorough survey and analysis of influenza A virus
genomic sequences, together with a literature review
yielded unexpected, but very interesting results.
Influenza A viruses from the first half of the 20th century
were surveyed first; these sequences revealed that almost
all the human viruses possessed an ORF on the negative
strand of segment 8, which we call NEG8, that was at least
167 codons long. The 4 human viruses without this 167
codon ORF, due to mutation of the start codon, form a
distinct clade (Figure 2); 1 member is A/bellamy/
1942H1N1 (Accession no. M12596). These 4 viruses,
which were isolated between 1942 and 1945, clearly demonstrate that this ORF is not absolutely essential for
human influenza A viruses to 1) replicate and cause disease in humans, and 2) persist in the human population/
environment and cause infection over several influenza
seasons. However, the conservation of this 167 codon
NEG8 ORF over almost 50 years suggested to us that it had
a selectable role in the viral life cycle that maintained it in
the human influenza A virus population. The data from
this relatively small group of 53 virus isolates, including
human, avian and swine viruses, also shows that similar
segments, with 167 codon NEG8 ORFs were present in a
small number of swine and avian influenza A viruses circulating in the same time period. Interestingly, the 1902
avian influenza A virus segment 8 sequences also possess
the 167 codon NEG8 ORF, and therefore does not conflict
with the hypothesis that one or more segments of the
1918 human influenza A virus were derived from avian
influenza A virus source [17,18,32]. Similarly long ORFs
were not observed for the other segments of the influenza
A virus genome.

ORF is shown as a dashed red arrow.
This first analysis also revealed another subset of a 5
human influenza A viruses that possesses a mutation that
changes the TAG stop codon of the NEG8 ORF into TAT,
which is translated as tyrosine. These viruses form a distinct clade, with the earliest isolate, A/Albany/4835/
1948H1N1 (Accession no. CY019951), collected in 1948.

This mutation results in the extension of the NEG8 ORF
to 216 codons (Figure 1). Since viruses that lost the 167
codon NEG8 ORF have not persisted in the human population more than a few years, it was of interest to examine
the persistence of the mutation that extended the NEG8
ORF. A review of all viruses isolated after 1947 revealed

that essentialy all subsequent human influenza A viruses
have probably evolved from this group of viruses, or close
relatives, which possess the 216 codon NEG8 ORF (Figure
3). Of 1739 true human influenza A viruses (all H and N
types), meaning viruses isolated from humans but derived
from birds (H5N1) or swine (current H1N1 pandemic
virus) were excluded, isolated after 1950, all but 62 possess a 216 codon (or longer) NEG8 ORF. A description of
the non-216 codon NEG8 ORFs, together with the
number of each type is given in Table 1; these still possess
the change that caused the original loss of the stop codon
after the 167 codon ORF. An examination of this group of
viruses shows that the variants arose from far fewer than
62 separate events and that within this group (non-216
codon ORF NEG8) there are actually only 2 examples that
show sufficient persistence and spread in the human population, albeit very briefly, to be subsequently re-isolated
from other individuals with influenza.
The complete penetration of this mutation though the
human influenza A viruses, which extends the NEG8 ORF
to 216 codons, strongly suggests that it is providing a
selective advantage to the virus. To exclude the possibility
that this mutation was functioning through an effect on
the NS1 protein, which is encoded by an overlapping
(opposite direction) gene (Figure 1), we examined the
sequence and variability of this site in the NS1 gene. This
mutation changes the highly conserved NS1 codon 88
from CGC to CGA, but since both encode the amino acid
arginine, this mutation apparently has no effect on the
NS1 protein.
The next analysis examined the distribution of NEG8 ORF
sizes, defined as the longest ORF on the genomic strand of
segment 8, in non-human influenza A viruses post-1950.
For avian influenza A viruses, 2646 (including avianderived, but isolated from humans, H5N1) had a NEG8

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/198

ORF of <110 codons, 90 had a 110 <NEG8 ORF<155
codons, 16 had NEG8 ORF = 167 codons and 10 had
NEG8 ORF>167 codons. For swine influenza A viruses, 64
had NEG8 <140 codons, 184 had NEG8 = 167 codons, 2
had NEG8 = 216 codons. For non-human/non-avian/
non-swine influenza A viruses, all 221 had NEG8 ORFs
that were <135 codons; a virus isolated from mink had a
167 codon NEG8 ORF (most probably a swine-derived
virus) and a virus isolated from a giant anteater has a 216
codon NEG8 ORF (probably a human-derived virus).
Thus it appears that the large, 216 codon ORF NEG8 is primarily associated with human flu A viruses, although a
significant number of swine viruses possess the 167 codon
NEG8 ORF similar to that which was circulating in the
human population pre-1948. 9 avian viruses had a NEG8
ORF of 216 codons and 1 had a NEG8 ORF of 172
codons. These all had the same TAG > TAT change at the
STOP codon after codon 167 as discovered in the human
viruses and the serotypes were H9N2 (9) and H6N1 (1).
The 2 swine viruses that contained a 216 codon NEG8
ORF also had the same change as the human viruses and
were serotypes H1N1, isolated in 2007 (China, Accession
No. FJ415613; A/swine/Zhejiang/1/2007(H1N1)), and
H3N2, isolated in 2004 (Thailand, Accession No.
AB434372; A/swine/Ratchaburi/NIAH59/2004(H3N2)).
We were also curious whether an ORF similar to NEG8
existed in any of the influenza B or C viruses. From the flu
B and C viruses in the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource, the
longest ORF on the negative strand of the NS coding segments were 103 and 109 codons respectively, and were
found in the middle and 3' end of the negative strand,
respectively. The predicted proteins from these ORFs had
no significant similarity to the flu A NEG8 predicted protein.

1At least 2 nucleotides are changed when this stop codon is produced. Only 1 amino acid changes in the NS1 protein, at a relatively variable
position. Phylogeny suggests approximately 13 different viruses arose in a variety of years with this stop codon after codon 197 in NEG8 ORF. 2142
codon ORF results from downstream AUG codon. Some of these ORFs would probably not be translated beyond a short peptide if the usual
NEG8 initiating AUG is used.

Bioinformatics evidence for a novel influenza A virus ORF
Considerable work has been performed to try and predict
the significance of open reading frames and the likelihood
of them being protein-coding; much of this has focused
on the ratio of substitution rates at non-synonymous and
synonymous sites [33]. Some work has also been applied
to finding overlapping genes in viruses [34-36]. However,
analysis of the influenza A virus segment 8 has several
complicating factors, 1) the entire segment is only about
890 nucleotides, 2) NS1 and NEP genes overlap in two
separate regions, 3) the NEG8 ORF overlaps both NS1 and
NEP genes, and 4) the NEG8 ORF is on the opposite
strand to the NS1 and NEP genes. Thus, these multiple
overlaps of the 3 ORFs preclude the use of standard analyses. We therefore took the approach of directly examining nucleotide positions within segment 8, which had
acquired mutations that were fixed in the human influenza A virus population during the last 60 years. Such
mutations occurred at a single time point and did not very
over subsequent years. For this period, human and avian
virus sequences were available from 58 and 31 different

years, respectively. More than twice as many mutations
were fixed in the human segment 8 sequences than those
derived from avian sources (a single avian segment 8 genotype (1E) was used as determined at the FluGenome genotyping resource; http://www.flugenome.org/). In the
human viruses, these fixed single nucleotide substitutions
resulted in 22 amino acid changes in the predicted NEG8
polypeptide sequence, and of course, there was no introduction of new stop codons because the 216 codon NEG8
ORF was maintained (Table 2). In contrast, in the avian
viruses, the fixed single nucleotide substitutions resulted
in 10 amino acid changes in the region equivalent to the
NEG8 ORF, one of which was the introduction of a new
stop codon in this reading frame (Table 3). This data,
which shows that there are more mutations that both 1)
change amino acid coding in NEG8 and 2) subsequently
fixed or perpetuated in the virus population supports the
hypothesis that the NEG8 ORF is conserved in human
influenza A viruses and not in avian influenza A viruses.
Furthermore, it suggests that the human influenza A virus
NEG8 ORF is under positive selection.

NS2 protein

Table 2: Nucleotide positions (aligned) of fixed mutations in
human influenza A virus genomes (Continued)

Of 36 fixed single-nucleotide mutations in the avian influenza A
viruses in the region of genome segment 8 spanning the region
equivalent to the NEG8 ORF, 11 had no effect on NS1, NS2 or NEG8
reading frames, 17/36 had no effect on NS1, 4/5 had no effect on NS2.
22/36 mutations resulted in a change in the predicted amino acid
sequence of the NEG8 protein

An alignment of the 38 avian influenza A virus segment 8
sequences reveals that approximately 52% of the nucleotides are conserved (100% identical) in every virus. The
conservation among the 58 human sequences collected
over the same time span is much greater, with 75% of the
nucleotide positions perfectly conserved. This higher conservation may be the result of an additional selection pressure requiring the maintenance of a 3rd gene, the 216
codon NEG8 ORF, in human viruses. This hypothesis is
supported by the fact that the point mutations (not fixed
in the population) that appeared in the 38 avian influenza
A virus segment 8 sequences resulted in the generation of
stop-codons within the NEG8 reading frame through at
least 7 independent events (stop-codons at the same position in sequences from neighboring years were only
counted once). A focused analysis of natural selection in
human H3N2 influenza A viruses [36] similarly also
revealed a reduction in the number of variable nucleotide
positions in the region where the NS1 gene overlaps with
the NEG8 ORF compared with the other non-overlapping
gene regions. The number of variable nucleotide positions
in the NS1-NEG8 overlap region was similar to that
observed for the NS1-NEP overlap region [36]. As noted
above, the overlapping ORFs in segment 8 make codon
use analysis untenable, but we did observe that the ratio
of NEG8 codons (1:28) that are scored as low "relative
adaptiveness" for human codon use was no different to
that found for the 2 genes on the opposite RNA strand
(data not shown), this was approximately 1.6 times

higher than human influenza A virus genes that do not
overlap other ORFs.

avian influenza A virus (segment 8 genotype 1E) genomes

Position

Although the maintenance of a 167 and later 216 codon
ORF over almost 100 years in an RNA virus renowned for
its variability (1.94+/-0.09 × 10-3 substitutions/nucleotide
site/yr [38]) is strongly indicative of an important function for the product of the NEG8 ORF, it doesn't prove
that it is actually translated into protein in infected cells.
Fortunately, there is biological evidence in the literature
that this ORF is indeed translated into protein. In a study
that mapped the CTL epitope repertoire of a 1934 (A/
Puerto Rico/8/34) human influenza A virus, Zhong et. al.
[39] first predicted (SYFPEITHI software, [40]) a murine
H-2 Db/Kb CTL epitope (GGLPFSLL) within the 167 aa
protein translated from the NEG8 ORF (denoted HP,
hypothetical protein, in the paper) of this virus and then
confirmed that CTLs isolated from mice infected with this
virus responded by producing IFN-g when presented with
the pure peptide [39]. In an IFN-g-ELISPOT assay, this
NEG8 peptide ranked 5th most effective IFN-g inducer of a
group of 13 peptides that included a series of the most
potent flu CTL epitopes. In another assay, which measured intracellular IFN-g, the NEG8 peptide induced a
response in 1.5, 2.5 and 4.0% of CD8+ T cells ranking 10th,
12th and 4th in a group of 16 peptides, which again
included several known strong IFN-g inducers. In these
two experiments, the authors recognized peptides as positive inducers of intracellular IFN-g if they produced at
least 3-fold higher activity than background [39]. However, not only did the NEG8 peptide surpass this cut-off by
a considerable margin, but it was also more potent than
several proven immunogenic CD8+ T cell epitopes. Our
interpretation of this data is that during the influenza A

Evidence for the expression of FluA NEG8 ORF
With the above data, we hypothesized that certain influenza A viruses encode a novel protein, translated from a
genomic sense copy of segment 8 and that this protein
provides a selective advantage to the virus in a human
host. Since the NEG8 ORF has been maintained in human
influenza viruses since at least 1918, first as a 167 codon
ORF and from 1948 as a 216 codon ORF, we predict that
both forms of the protein product should be functional in
humans. In addition to the absence of the NEG8 ORF
(167 or 216 codon variants) from almost all non-human
viruses, experiments using mouse-adapted human influenza A viruses also indicate that NEG8 may only function
in humans. First, examination, by construction of specific
genetic reassortments, of a mouse-adapted human flu A
virus (A/FM/1/47-MA) indicated that segment 8 did not
affect virulence in mice [37]. Second, introduction of the
1918 segment 8 into a mouse adapted virus resulted in
attenuation of the virus in mice, rather than enhancing
pathogenesis [18].

ancestry. However, since the influenza A virus NEG8 ORF
appears to have developed secondary to the NS1 and NEP
genes on segment 8 of the viral genome, it is likely that
there are no ancestral genes to be found. Therefore it was
not surprising that our PSI-BLAST searches and analysis
with HHSearch failed to find any distantly related protein
sequences. We believe that the previously noted [30] similarity of the predicted NEG8 protein and a Tetrahymena
protein (Accession no. Q950Z5) is spurious and the result
of matching of the hydrophobic signal sequence of NEG8
protein and the highly skewed amino acid composition of
the Tetrahymena protein.
Subsequent bioinformatics analyses focused on searching
for functional polypeptide motifs. For this series of experiments the 167 codon NEG8 ORF of the 1918 strain of
influenza A virus and the 216 codon NEG8 ORF of 2
human H1N1 viruses (1950, Access. No. K00576; 2006,
Access. No. CY017375) and 2 human H3N2 viruses
(1970, Access. No. AY210306; 2006, Access. No.
CY016999) were used. InterProScan [45], flagged only
potential signal sequences and transmembrane domains
(TMs) in these 5 proteins. ScanProsite [46,47], found no
hits when searching for non-frequent motifs, and none of
the sites of common patterns (e.g. N-linked glycosylation
site) were absolutely conserved among the 5 proteins.
To evaluate the significance of the predictions of a signal
peptide and TMs we retested the 5 proteins with multiple
software tools including SignalP v3.0 (SignalP-NN and
SignalP-HMM) [48,49], Phobius [50], SPOCTOPUS [51],
TOPCONS [52], TMHMM [53] and SIGNAL-BLAST [54].
Although there were some minor discrepancies between
the results of these programs, Figure 3 shows the consensus organization with the presence of a signal peptide and
2 TMs. The variations (some proteins, some tools) were 1)
inability to distinguish the signal peptide from the first
TM and 2) the occasional prediction of a third TM at the
end of the 216 aa protein. The 5 proteins range from
approximately 78-92% pair-wise aa identity and the consistent prediction of the signal peptide and TMs suggests
that this organization should be considered as a potential
structural model. It is interesting to note that the 49 codon
extension to the 167 codon ORF following the mutation
in approximately 1947 would result in the simple extension of the C-terminal "Outside" domain of the predicted
NEG8 proteins (Figure 3).

segment 8 RNA has a number of significant implications.
The first and perhaps simplest consequence is that this
genome segment would be ambi-sense, a unique feature
in the Orthomyxoviruses. Second, if the maintenance of
the 216 codon NEG8 ORF in essentially all human influenza A viruses is because it is translated into a polypeptide
that confers a selectable advantage upon the virus, then
the conclusions derived from many of the published
experiments that used deletion and site-specific mutations
to investigate the role of the NS1 and NEP proteins on the
replication and virulence of human influenza A viruses
would need to be re-evaluated because many of these
engineered mutations also interfere with the integrity of
the NEG8 ORF [55-59]. The third important implication
relates to the fact that this NEG8 ORF is almost universally
linked to human influenza A viruses and the associated
consequences of its introduction into an avian or swine
influenza A virus through co-infection and re-assortment.
The 1957 (H2N2) and 1968 (H3N2) human influenza A
pandemics arose from antigenic shift events following the
introduction of NA and/or HA gene segments into the
human influenza A virus circulating at the time [1,32,60]
with no exchange of genome segment 8; the same segment 8 genotype has circulated in the human population
since, at least, the 1918 pandemic and is therefore presumably well-adapted to provide viral fitness when the
virus is replicating in humans. Currently, there are 2
zoonotic influenza A viruses, avian-derived H5N1 and
swine-derived H1N1, that are potential pandemic viruses
and one must consider the effect of the introduction of a
human segment 8 into one of these viruses. The avianderived H5N1 virus is highly pathogenic but transmits to
and among humans poorly [14], where as the swine-origin H1N1 virus appears to be far less pathogenic but transmits easily among humans [61]. Since the 167 and 216
codon ORFs are absent from both the H5N1 avian influenza viruses and the new swine-derived H1N1 viruses, the
introduction of this NEG8 ORF into either of these viruses
by reassortment with a human influenza A virus or by
mutation could have very dire consequences. If the highly
pathogenic H5N1 avian virus acquired a human influenza
A virus genome segment 8 with the 216 codon NEG8
ORF, it might become more easily transmitted among
humans; alternatively, if the swine-derived H1N1 virus
acquires human influenza A virus genome segment 8
from a currently circulating human H1N1 or H3N2 virus
then the novel virus might have increased virulence associated with the NS1 virulence factor [12,62] or the 216
codon NEG8 ORF. Both of these scenarios potentially
have enormous consequences for human health, in part
because of the lack of previous exposure of humans to
these strains by natural infection or vaccination.

Discussion
Our hypothesis proposing that a novel gene is encoded by
the genomic sense strand of the human influenza A virus

However, the latter appears more likely because both of
these H1N1 virus types are apparently now replicating

efficiently in humans. Analysis of the sequence of the
swine-derived H1N1 genome segment 8 revealed that it
contains the same initiating ATG as the human NEG8
ORF and only requires the removal of 2 stop codons, each
by a single nucleotide change, to generate the 216 codon
NEG8 ORF (Figure 4). Only 1 nucleotide change is
required to produce the 167 codon variant of the NEG8
ORF. The product of a swine-derived H1N1 NEG8 ORF
constructed in this way would share 71% amino acid
identity with the current human NEG8 protein over the
216 aa.
The rather sudden and total replacement of the 167 codon
NEG8 ORF by the 216 codon NEG8 ORF after 1947 is
especially intriguing. It is interesting to note that a human
influenza A virus H1N1 pseudopandemic (low death rates)
also occurred in 1947 [63]. This has been attributed to a
significant, but non-shift, antigenic change in HA and NA
proteins [64]. However, due to a lack of genomic
sequence information, it is impossible to determine
whether the coincident change to the 216 codon ORF was
involved in creating a virus capable of spreading worldwide or whether the pseudopandemic merely coincided
with the genetic change and had the effect of seeding that
virus type throughout the world. However, the maintenance of the 216 codon NEG8 ORF over many years
appears to be a very different matter; very few human non216 codon ORFs have been isolated and none have per-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/198

sisted, whereas there are multiple examples of the appearance of stop codons in this reading frame for the avian
viruses. It is also notable that human-specific selection on
amino acid sequence has been observed in the influenza
A virus M protein [65].
Since there is no recognized mechanism for the translation of ORFs encoded on the genomic strands of influenza
viruses, an obvious question is "how could a NEG8 protein be produced?". The answer is that there are already a
number of examples in the literature describing the detection of CTL epitopes from non-traditionally derived proteins (reviewed in [66]), which are produced at low levels.
Interestingly, in addition to PB1-F2, the production an
additional influenza A peptide (N40, a fragmented version of PB1 protein) has been recently demonstrated[67].
Mechanisms for generation of rare proteins include ribosomal frameshifting (e.g. from the influenza NP gene
[68]), non-AUG initiation of translation (e.g. from the
influenza HA gene [69]), initiation codon scanthrough
(e.g. from the influenza NP gene [70]) and internal initiation of translation (e.g. Hepatitis C virus F protein [71]).
Clearly, some of these mechanisms (those that utilize a
normal viral mRNA) are not appropriate for translation of
an ORF from an influenza A virus genomic RNA, however,
these data reinforce the fact that molecular processes are
not perfect and that errors in transcriptional and translational events are likely to lead to the production of small

amounts of such non-traditional polypeptides, which in
turn provide targets for evolutionary forces and may lead
to the eventual evolution of novel genes such as PB1-F2
[36] and NEG8. Another mechanism, present in some
viruses, is the use of Internal Ribosome Entry Sites (IRES),
which are complex structural features present in mRNAs
[72,73] that provide a mechanism for initiation of translation independent of a 5'-CAP; although no such structure is obvious in the 5' end of the genomic RNA of
segment 8, the presence of IRES elements are very difficult
to predict computationally [74] since they are extremely
variable in sequence [75-78].
Normal influenza A virus mRNAs, but not genomic RNAs,
are poly-adenylated by stuttering of the polymerase,
which is a process integrated with of mRNA transcription[79]. Although polyadenylation stimulates mRNA
translation, it is not absolutely required[80]. Therefore the
high levels of influenza A virus genomic RNA in infected
cells, could be sufficient to allow some translation of the
NEG8 ORF even if the RNA is not poly-adenylated.
Finally, although this 216 codon NEG8 ORF is very tightly
associated with human influenza A virus infections and
may have been a factor in the 1947 pseudopandemic, its
role in viral pathogenesis may be very difficult to unravel.
First, the NEG8 ORF overlaps with NS1 and NEP genes on
segment 8, which makes it a difficult target for deletion
and mutagenesis studies, and second, because the NEG8
ORF is not absolutely essential for replication of human
influenza A virus in either its 167 or 216 codon form
(PB1-F2 and N40 are also not essential) nor present in
most animal and avian influenza A viruses, it may be very
difficult to correlate an observable phenotype with its
presence using animal models.

Conclusion
There is an unusually long (648 nt) ORF on the genomic
(negative) strand of segment 8 of current human influenza A viruses. The very high degree of conservation of
this ORF and the detection of a CTL response to a peptide
fragment of the predicted protein suggests the ORF is
expressed. The predominant association of this ORF with
human influenza A viruses indicates that an expressed
protein may only be an advantage to influenza viruses
replicating in humans; this could have very significant
implications if the swine H1N1 influenza A virus, which
is currently causing a human pandemic mutated to
acquire this novel ORF.

otype were selected using FluGenome, a web tool for genotyping influenza virus [82]. Segment 8 sequences from
all genomes were used (>2000), with the exception of 1)
duplicates, 2) those with severe truncations and 3) those
with frameshift errors (in NS1 or NS2 genes) that were
assumed to be sequencing mistakes. Duplicate and truncated sequences (<5%) were avoided using NCBI selection parameters. A local script was used for translating the
longest ORF on the genome strand.
Bioinformatics software
MUSCLE was used for generating multiple sequence alignments [83], which were viewed and edited using the Java
program Base-By-Base [84] via the Viral Bioinformatics
Resource Center [85]. The ORF Finder software at the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (USA)
was used to visualize the length of the NEG8 ORF.

SignalP v3.0 (SignalP-NN and SignalP-HMM) [48,49],
Phobius [50], SPOCTOPUS [51], TOPCONS [52],
TMHMM [53] and SIGNAL-BLAST [54] were used to predict signal peptide and transmembrane domains in
NEG8.
