Unexpected complexity of the Reef-Building Coral
Acropora millepora transcription factor network
Taewoo Ryu, Charalampos Harris Mavromatis, Till Bayer, Christian R Voolstra* and Timothy Ravasi*

Abstract
Background: Coral reefs are disturbed on a global scale by environmental changes including rising sea surface
temperatures and ocean acidification. Little is known about how corals respond or adapt to these environmental
changes especially at the molecular level. This is mostly because of the paucity of genome-wide studies on corals
and the application of systems approaches that incorporate the latter. Like in any other organism, the response of
corals to stress is tightly controlled by the coordinated interplay of many transcription factors.
Results: Here, we develop and apply a new system-wide approach in order to infer combinatorial transcription
factor networks of the reef-building coral Acropora millepora. By integrating sequencing-derived transcriptome
measurements, a network of physically interacting transcription factors, and phylogenetic network footprinting we
were able to infer such a network. Analysis of the network across a phylogenetically broad sample of five species,
including human, reveals that despite the apparent simplicity of corals, their transcription factors repertoire and
interaction networks seem to be largely conserved. In addition, we were able to identify interactions among
transcription factors that appear to be species-specific lending strength to the novel concept of “Taxonomically
Restricted Interactions”.
Conclusions: This study provides the first look at transcription factor networks in corals. We identified a
transcription factor repertoire encoded by the coral genome and found consistencies of the domain architectures
of transcription factors and conserved regulatory subnetworks across eumetazoan species, providing insight into
how regulatory networks have evolved.

Background
Deciphering and predicting transcriptional regulatory
networks is of considerable importance in understanding
how organisms function, adapt, and respond to changes
in their environment. Much effort has been addressed to
elucidate these regulatory networks in several model
organisms. For instance, global transcription factors
(TFs) combinatorial interaction maps were built in
human and mouse [1] and developmental gene regulatory circuits were elucidated in the sea urchin embryo
[2,3]. However, little effort has been made so far in
understanding the structure, function, and conversation
of transcriptional networks in non-model organisms, e.g.
corals, despite their ecological importance.

Corals are members of the phylum Cnidaria that
includes such diverse forms as jellyfish, hydra, and sea
anemones. Reef-building corals (Cnidaria: Hexacorallia:
Scleractinia) in symbiosis with their unicellular photosynthetic dinoflagellate symbionts (Alveolata: Dinophycea: Symbiodinium) provide the foundation of coral reef
ecosystems, and are well known for providing biodiversity to marine ecosystems [4]. The sensitivity of corals
to environmental stresses such as temperature, salinity,
and nutrient loading make them highly vulnerable to climate change, ocean acidification, and other anthropogenic impacts [5]. As a consequence, coral cover has
continuously declined in recent decades [6]. A more
detailed understanding of how scleractinian corals and
their associated microbes will respond to environmental
changes is needed in order to eventually establish effective management policies that are able to conserve and
sustain coral reef ecosystems. So far only a few studies
have looked at the mechanisms on a molecular level

[7-12] that go beyond transcriptome annotation and
ortholog identification [13,14]. The emerging picture
from these studies is that corals are complex organisms
as revealed by a diverse set of receptors and a comprehensive innate immunity reservoir which are important
for responses to the environment [15].
In this study, we developed and applied a systemswide integrative approach to assess the complexity of
the Acropora millepora transcription factor (TF) network by reconstructing a TF interaction map from
known interactions and comparing it to those of four
model organisms (fruitfly, sea urchin, mouse, and
human). The A. millepora TF repertoire was identified
using sequence-specific DNA binding domains from
DBD [16]. Subsequently conserved combinatorial TF
interactions as well as species-specific TF interactions
were inferred by the integration of the fly, mouse and
human TFs interaction networks [1,17] followed by phylogenetic network footprinting analysis. Our study provides not only the first comprehensive catalog of A.
millepora TFs but also a first assessment of how these
are organized to form transcriptional networks. Evidence
of conservation and divergence across the phylogenetic
tree can also be inferred from this analysis. The analysis
presented here can be considered a starting point for a
more comprehensive study of regulatory networks in
corals based on coral reef genomics- and systems biology-based interpretive framework.

Results and Discussion

Figure 1 Workflow showing our systematic approach used to
infer species-specific transcription factor networks across
eumetazoan animals.

49,320 protein sequences were chosen from 104,005 contigs/singletons in coral transcriptome data by abovementioned two approaches, respectively.
To identify the transcription factor repertoire we used
147 sequence-specific DNA binding domains which
have been manually curated recently [16]. Protein
sequences of the five analyzed species (Acropora millepora, Drosophila melanogaster, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Mus musculus, and Homo sapiens) were
searched by InterProScan to identify those with DNA
binding domain signatures [21]. Any protein was
regarded as a TF if it had at least one such domain.
This approach yielded 359 TF signatures in coral, 1,047
in fruitfly, 839 in sea urchin, 1,462 in mouse, and 1,885
in human (see Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5).

The A. millepora TF repertoire

Recently, the planulae transcriptome of the staghorn
coral A. millepora was published using next generation
sequencing technology [13]. Even though comprehensive
information such as gene composition, gene ontology,
and associated signaling/metabolic pathways are
revealed, detailed mechanisms for the understanding of
coral-specific function including the TFs repertoire and
their interaction to form transcriptional networks
remain to be elucidated. In this study, the TF repertoire
and interaction network in A. millepora were computationally surveyed using a unique experiment-derived TFs
interactome [1] and a phylogenetic network footprinting
approach [18] as shown in Figure 1.
Firstly, all possible open reading frames (ORF) for each
contig and singleton were identified and translated by
applying GetORF [19]. To identify coral proteins whose
orthologs exist in other species, all coding sequences
were queried against NCBI non-redundant (nr) database
using BLASTp [20], the best-hit sequence for each contig
or singleton was chosen. If no best hit was found, the
longest coding sequence of contig/singleton was chosen.
The latter cases are most likely coral-specific proteins or
new proteins currently uncharacterized. 19,840 and

Evolutionary signatures of the A. millepora transcription
factors repertoire

In order to define the evolutionary signatures of the A.
millepora TF repertoire, we analyzed the protein domain
composition of the TFs across the five species. We
scanned, the full-length protein sequences of all the TFs
using the Pfam database [22]. The 359 TFs identified in
A. millepora contained 60 Pfam domains. We also compared the domain composition of A. millepora with that
of the fruit fly (1,047 TFs with 123 domains), sea urchin
(839 TFs with 157 domains), mouse (1,462 TFs with
166 domains) and human (1,885 TFs with 168 domains),
(see Additional file 6).
Interestingly, the ten most common domains in each
species were highly conserved across animal phylogeny
(i.e. all five organisms) (Figure 2). However, some
domains seemed to be more abundant in coral or marine organisms (i.e. sea urchin and coral) in comparison
to the other species (i.e. terrestrial organisms). Ets and
Fork head were more frequent in the TF repertoire of
coral and sea urchin compared to the fly, mouse, and
human. Common life style characteristics might result
in such similarities, but further analyses are needed to

Figure 2 Phylogenetic relationship between five species and domain architectures. Pie charts on the bottom show the percentages of the
top ten TF domains for each organism. Even though A. millepora diverged very early and is morphologically different, it shows a similar domain
composition as other lineages and appears as complex as highly evolved bilaterian organisms according to the domain architecture.

elucidate the underlying factors that cluster the organisms in these groups. T-box domains were more abundant in coral than other species. Interestingly,
proportion of hormone receptor domain is quite low in
coral. Four coral TFs contain this domain while fruit fly,
sea urchin, mouse, and human have 39, 56, 60, and 101
TFs containing this domain, respectively (see Additional
file 6). Hormone receptor domains code for a component of steroid or nuclear hormone receptor TFs (function and origin reviewed in [23]). Even though the
origin of steroid receptors has been placed during late
stage of deuterostome divergence so far [23], our data
suggest that steroid receptors, or at least their functional
domains, might have emerged presumably before the
divergence of radiata and bilateria (Figure 2). As discussed in a previous study [24], the results of protein
family domains analyses have evolutionary implications
and can be used to describe evolutionary common life
styles and characteristics. Here, we applied an arcsine
transformation to the domain distribution in order to
reconstruct the evolutionary relationships across the five
species [25]. The resulting phylogenetic tree placed each

species according to the symmetry of their body design,
going from radial to bilateral symmetry, and further on
from protostomes to deuterostomes (Figure 2). Hence,
our TF domain-based phylogeny recapitulates the established evolutionary relationships between species.
Inferring A. millepora transcriptional network using
phylogenetic network footprinting

Little is known about transcriptional networks in marine
organisms. This is especially true for corals and to a lesser
extent for the sea urchin that has been studied with a view
to learn more about embryonic transcriptional networks
[2], especially if compared to well-studied organisms such
as human and mouse. It is widely accepted that for a given
pair of interacting proteins, their corresponding orthologs
in other species also interact with each other and this propensity is stronger for highly connected proteins
[18,26-28]. These conserved interaction pairs across species, referred to as interlogs, are at the conceptual center
of many comparative studies [18,26-28]. Here, for the first
step of interlog inference, we identified ortholog groups
for each pair of the five species using the Inparanoid

Ryu et al. BMC Systems Biology 2011, 5:58
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/5/58

algorithm [29] that is known as the most accurate algorithm for true ortholog finding [29,30]. We collected 5,238
human and 1,145 mouse experimentally verified TF interactions from recently published mammalian 2 hybrid
assay [1] and 45 fly TF interactions from DIP [17] to construct a TF interaction dataset that represented our source
network for the following analysis. All orthologs for a
given known interacting TF pair (A-B) were retrieved
from Inparanoid result to infer interlogs for the experimentally verified TF dataset source interactions. All possible ortholog combinations of A and B were assumed to
interact with each other. This occasionally yielded multiple
interlogs from single source interactions, e.g. we retrieved
one-to-many or many-to-many ortholog relationships as
seen in Figure 3. We consequently interpreted these cases
as network expansions. These ortholog relationships are
usually the result of gene duplication after speciation
events, and this property is specifically captured by the
Inparanoid algorithm [31]. We deemed those interactions
as true interactions for the following reasons. First, it is
widely accepted that one primary source of new genes in
eukaryotes is gene duplication followed by divergence.
The interacting partners are usually retained between
paralogs [32,33]. Second, paralogs duplicated after speciation event (i.e. inparalogs) generally share similar functions
and interactions compared to paralogs that were duplicated before speciation events (i.e. outparalogs) [31,34].
Consequently, inparalogs were deemed as true interactions. During above procedure, TFs without any sequencespecific DNA binding domains were excluded. Our
approach therefore assures reliable interaction networks
by integrating experimentally proven TF interactions,
sequence similarity, and functional units of TFs together
in a single framework. We were able to infer a total of
3,985 TF interactions with this phylogenetic network footprinting approach. The total number of interactions
including source and inferred interactions were 5,509 for
human, 2,323 for mouse, 524 for sea urchin, 599 for fruitfly, and 134 for coral (see Additional files 7, 8, 9, 10, and
11). Finally, protein interaction networks were aligned
across the five organisms, and conserved TF interactions
were identified (see Additional files 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16).
The resulting conserved interactions provide the first
insight into the structure and properties of combinatorial
transcriptional networks in coral and sea urchin
(Figure 3A and 3B).
A. millepora transcriptional network shows properties of
those of Bilaterian organisms

A close analysis of the conserved transcriptional network depicted in Figure 3A reveals surprising and intriguing properties. A. millepora organization of TFs into
regulatory networks is similar to those of bilateral
organisms. For example A. millepora has a homeobox

Page 4 of 9

gene regulatory sub-network, comprised of several Hox
genes, that is conserved across evolution. In general,
syntenic occurrence of these Hox genes was considered
a prerequisite for the correct function of these transcription factors in animals [35]. However, disintegration of
Hox clusters has been observed in diverse taxa including
several cnidarians, and thus the evolutionary significance
of synteny regions is in question [36-40]. We wonder if
interaction retention between Hox genes might be more
important than merely close physical linkage of them.
More specifically, one of the larger and most conserved
transcriptional networks in A. millepora was identified
among Hox gene regulatory sub-networks (Figure 3A),
and this network is enriched for genes that are implicated in developmental process such as neural tube formation in mammals. Furthermore, there is evidence that
this network expanded during mammalian divergence.
This probably represents a net gain in modularity and
plasticity for the network in more complex organisms
(Figure 3A), which might reflect an increase in transcriptional plasticity and control.
TF interaction network of A. millepora also showed
scale-free property despite relatively small number of
TFs compared to other species (Figure 4).
Evidence for Taxonomically Restricted Interactions (TRIs)

In evolutionary biology the concept of Taxonomically
Restricted Genes (TRGs) is associated with those genes
that are restricted to particular species and are responsible for species-specific phenotypes and/or lineage-specific adaptations [41]. These genes usually evolve and
adapt as a consequence of the specific environment and
lifestyle of the organism and are more common in
organisms that live in extreme environmental conditions. Although we do not debate the existence of such
TRGs, we identified cases where the transcriptional network differs between specific organisms. Most importantly this does not correlate with the complexity of the
organism but rather with its adaptation to a particular
environment. Consequently, we propose that modulation
of transcriptional networks might be a prime mechanism for species-specific adaptations. For example in Figure 3B, we report cases where specific interactions were
gained or lost in specific species during evolution. In
other words, we can identify what we like to call “Taxonomically Restricted Interactions” (TRIs). This new concept is also supported by the network expansion that we
see in the mammalian lineage (Figure 3A). Overall, the
concept might give a better explanation how an organism adapts to specific environments than merely considering a set of TRGs. Note that we anticipate plentiful
examples of TRIs if whole protein interactomes were to
be compared. Our results also support the notion that
transcriptional networks evolve by gene duplication

followed by gain or loss of specific interactions [42]. For
example, the subnetworks in Figure 3B are typical examples of lineage-specific network expansions by gene
duplication and interaction retention.
We also identified an interesting subnetwork that is
composed of the oncogene MAX (Figure 3B network 7).
In mammals, this network is composed of the homodimer of the oncogene MAX. In contrast, A. millepora
retained a paralog forming a redundant system that is
composed of two homodimers (Figure 3B). We argue
that this paralog diverged from its ortholog sister as
inferred from the alignment of the HLH domain and
the evolutionary tree (Figure 3C and 3D).

Methods

Conclusions
The here presented analysis scratches just the surface of
our understanding of the complex structure of the transcriptional network in A. millepora. This study is a first
attempt toward understanding the structure of the transcription factor networks in corals despite the paucity of
- omics-level datasets including genome sequences.
Contrary to the apparent simplicity of A. millepora, its
gene repertoire and more importantly its transcriptional
network are not so different from those of higher organisms and definitely not less complex than the ones of
other model organisms such as D. melanogaster, making
Scleractinian corals a candidate for a new model
organism.

Identification of TFs with DNA binding domains

Coral protein sequence identification

To identify A. millepora TFs, ORFs were firstly searched in
A. millepora transcriptome data [13] and then all possible
coding sequences were translated using GetORF with
default parameters [19]. Coding sequences from each contig/singleton were queried against the NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein database, and then best hits were chosen
using BLASTP program. If there was no hit to nr database,
the longest coding sequence (CDS) of the contig/singleton
was chosen as a final CDS. Among 104,005 contigs from
the transcriptome data, 19,840 and 49,320 sequences were
chosen by above two approaches, respectively.

To identify transcription factors of five analyzed species,
we used 147 Pfam domains that bind DNA in a
sequence-specific manner [16]. InterProScan [21] was
used to search Pfam domains in protein sequences of
five organisms, and then a protein was regarded as a TF
if it contains at least one DNA binding domain. This
resulted in 359, 1,047, 839, 1,462, 1,885 TFs for A. millepora (AM), D. melanogaster (DM), S. purpuratus (SP),
M. musculus (MM), and H. sapiens (HS), respectively.
To assess the accuracy of prediction, a ‘known’ human
TF set [43] was downloaded. 1,443 known TFs and
1,405 predicted TFs were obtained after converting TF
lists to Entrez gene IDs. Among the known TFs, 1,226

Ryu et al. BMC Systems Biology 2011, 5:58
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/5/58

were predicted correctly and 217 did not have any
sequence-specific DNA binding domains. 179 predicted
TFs did not overlap with known TFs. Positive predictive
value, ratio of true positives to sum of true and false
positives, was 87.26%.
Analysis of domain architecture

We searched the Pfam domain annotation for these 359
coral transcription factors, and recorded all types of
domains they contained. The results showed that the
total of all identified TFs consisted of 60 types of protein family domains.
To compare across species we applied an arcsine
transformation to above data [25]. The arcsine transformation converts a binomial random variable into one
that is nearly normal and whose variance depends very
little on the probability parameter, by taking the arcsine
of the square root of the abundance value for each functional family domain.
If X is a binomial random variable with parameters n
and p, then Y = sin−1

X
n

is the arcsine transforma-

tion of Χ.
We further applied a Fisher’s statistical test to measure
how significantly different the five organisms are, based on
their protein family domain composition. The contingency
table compiled data from the top ten Pfam domains. In
addition, we conducted pairwise comparisons to cluster
organisms based on their domain composition. We constructed a phylogenetic tree based on the top ten most
abundant protein domain families (Figure 2).
Ortholog identification

Identification of orthologous TFs is the essential part of
our approach. We therefore employed the Inparanoid
algorithm that was specifically designed for identifying
true orthologs solely based on the protein sequence
[29,30]. Protein sequences of analyzed species were
downloaded from NCBI (SP, MM, and HS) and Ensembl
(DM). Coral protein sequences were obtained as
described above. Inparanoid algorithm was applied for
each species pair and orthologous proteins were
retrieved.
Inference of interlogs

Based on the assumption that if two proteins interact in
one organism, their orthologs in other organisms will
also interact with each other [18], we inferred interacting orthologs across species, i.e. interlogs, using available
TF interaction data. 5,238 human and 1,145 mouse TF
interactions data were obtained from mammalian 2
hybrid assay [1]. 45 fruitfly TF interaction data was
additionally downloaded from DIP [17]. For each known

Page 7 of 9

interacting TF pair (A-B), we sought all orthologs of A
(Ai1, Ai2, ···, Aip, ···, and AiP, where 1≤p≤P) and B (Bi1,
B i2 , ···, B iq , ···, and B iQ , where 1≤q≤Q) in organism i
using Inparanoid result. All possible pairs of Aip and Biq
were then regarded as interlogs. In the case that an
interaction did not have at least one DNA binding
domain, this interaction was not considered. Finally,
3,985 interlogs were inferred using this approach, and
the total number of interactions including source and
inferred interactions were 5,509; 2,323; 524; 599 and 134
for human, mouse, sea urchin, fruitfly, and coral, respectively (see Additional files 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11).
Conserved TF interactions

Essential proteins and interactions are usually conserved
across many species [27,28]. We therefore aligned protein networks of above five model organisms in order to
find such elements, and sought conserved interactions
across five organisms (see Additional files 12, 13, 14, 15,
and 16).
