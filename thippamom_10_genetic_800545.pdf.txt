Abstract
Background: Influenza A virus causes severe disease in both humans and animals and thus, has a considerably
impact on economy and public health. In this study, the genetic variations of the nucleoprotein (NP) gene of
influenza viruses recovered from swine in Thailand were determined.
Results: Twelve influenza A virus specimens were isolated from Thai swine. All samples were subjected to
nucleotide sequencing of the complete NP gene. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted by comparing the NP gene
of swine influenza viruses with that of seasonal and pandemic human viruses and highly pathogenic avian viruses
from Thailand (n = 77). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the NP gene from different host species clustered in
distinct host specific lineages. The NP gene of swine influenza viruses clustered in either Eurasian swine or Classical
swine lineages. Genetic analysis of the NP gene suggested that swine influenza viruses circulating in Thailand
display 4 amino acids unique to Eurasian and Classical swine lineages. In addition, the result showed 1 and 5
amino acids unique to avian and human lineages, respectively. Furthermore, nucleotide substitution rates showed
that the NP gene is highly conserved especially in avian influenza viruses.
Conclusion: The NP gene sequence of influenza A in Thailand is highly conserved within host-specific lineages
and shows amino acids potentially unique to distinct NP lineages. This information can be used to investigate
potential interspecies transmission of influenza A viruses. In addition, the genetic variations of the NP gene will be
useful for monitoring the viruses and preparing effective prevention and control strategies for potentially pandemic
influenza outbreaks.

Background
Influenza A virus poses a serious threat to public health
worldwide, particularly the virus circulating in humans
and animal species such as birds, pigs and horses. Influenza A subtypes H1-3 and N1-2 have been circulating
in the human population, while Influenza A subtypes
H1 and 3 and N1-2 have been reported in swine. On
the other hand, all H1-16 and N1-9 can be found in
avian species [1,2]. The virus genome contains 8 segments of single-stranded RNA that encode 10-11

proteins. Among those genes, the NP gene plays a
major role with regard to host range or host species barriers for influenza A virus [3-5]. Genetic analysis of the
NP gene has facilitated identification of particular amino
acids correlated with host specificity [6]. At least two
large classes of NP gene, human and non-human, had
been classified by phylogenetic analysis [3,7,8]. NP protein functions include encapsidation of the virus genome
for RNA transcription, replication and packaging [9],
interaction with polypeptides in nuclear localization signals [10], direct interaction with viral polymerase for
unprimed viral replication [11] and cytotoxic T lymphocyte activation [12,13].
Recently, an influenza virus originating from swine
(S-OIV 2009) has emerged in humans and subsequently

spread worldwide. The 8 gene segments of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus originated from human lineage (PB1), avian lineage (PB2, PA), Eurasian swine
lineage (NA, M) and classical swine lineage (HA, NP,
NS) [14,15]. This serves as an example that certain
influenza A strains can harbor an NP gene that might
not be host specific, such as the S-OIV in humans. The
NP gene of S-OIV has been suggested to originate from
the classical swine influenza virus.
As of April 2010, approximately 166 nucleotide
sequences of the NP gene of influenza A viruses from
Thailand have been reported to the public database
(NCBI Influenza Virus Database). Among these
166 sequences, 97 were from avian (H5N1 = 96 and
H3N2 = 1), 55 from human (H1N1 = 24, H3N2 = 22,
and H5N1 = 9) and 14 from swine (H1N1 = 1, H1N2 =
1, and H3N2 = 6) viruses. In addition, most of the 166
sequences originated from virus isolated between 2000
and 2009, except for one virus that had been isolated in
1976. Due to the limited information on the NP gene of
influenza viruses recovered from various species especially swine in Thailand, the objective of this study was to
determine the genetic variation of the NP gene of influenza viruses isolated from swine in Thailand. In addition,
the NP gene sequences of seasonal and pandemic 2009
human viruses as well as highly pathogenic avian influenza were retrieved from the database and included in
the analysis.

human, classical swine and Eurasian swine lineages
(Fig 1). The avian NP lineage contains all avian influenza virus subtypes H5N1 (n = 24) and H3N2 (n = 1).
In addition, all human H5N1 viruses (n = 6) also clustered in this avian NP lineage. A human NP lineage
comprises two groups of seasonal human influenza subtypes H3N2 (n = 8) and H1N1 (n = 3). In contrast, the
pandemic 2009 influenza subtype H1N1 (n = 8) clustered with the classical swine NP linage. The swine
influenza viruses can be divided into 2 distinct lineages,
Eurasian swine lineage and classical swine lineage. Based
on topology of the phylogenetic tree, the Eurasian swine
lineage is closely related to the avian lineage and had
been previously designated “avian-like swine lineage”
[3,16]. Eighteen swine virus subtypes H1N1, H1N2 and
H3N2 from 2000-2009 clustered in this Eurasian swine
lineage. On the other hand, 8 swine virus subtypes
H3N2 and H1N1 were grouped with the classical swine
lineage. It is noteworthy that 12 swine viruses characterized in this study clustered in both the Eurasian
(H1N1 = 5, H1N2 = 1, and H3N2 = 2) and classical
swine lineage (H3N2 = 4) (Table 1 and Fig 1). It should
be noted that Thailand has imported swine for breeding
from both Europe and North America. In general, phylogenetic analysis of NP gene sequences of influenza A
viruses indicated that the NP gene is highly conserved
and largely grouped within the host range of the respective virus.

Genetic analyses

Complete NP gene of Thai swine influenza viruses

Pair-wise NP gene sequence comparisons of swine influenza viruses with 5 representative influenza viruses of
equine (PR/56), avian (CUK2), human (CU32), Eurasian
swine (9469/04) and classical swine lineages (K5/04) are
shown in table 2. The Thai swine influenza viruses were
found similar to 2 distinct lineages, the Eurasian and
classical swine lineages. Eight swine influenza viruses
displayed a high percentage of nucleotide identity (93.599.7%) to the European swine lineage (9469/04). On the
other hand, 4 swine influenza viruses were similar to the
classical swine lineage (K5/04) with 90.5-93.6% nucleotide identity. The deduced amino acids of the NP genes
of 77 influenza viruses were compared to evaluate the
host-specific nature of the NP gene. Few amino acid differences between lineages were detected indicating the
highly conserved nature of the NP gene especially, in
the avian lineage (table 3). Various reports have documented that particular amino acids are unique to distinct NP lineages [3]. In this study, one amino acid at
position 105 was found correlated with the avian specific lineage (105V). In the human lineage, 5 amino acids
at positions 16 (16D), 283 (283P), 293 (293K), 372
(372D), and 422 (422K) were highly conserved as
human-specific amino acids. Moreover, some amino

During 2005-2009, 12 swine influenza viruses were isolated from areas of intensive swine farming in central
and eastern regions of Thailand. The 12 swine influenza
isolates were identified as subtypes H1N1 (n = 6), H1N2
(n = 1) and H3N2 (n = 5) based on RT-PCR using subtype specific primers. To study the genetic variation of
the viruses, nucleotide sequencing was performed on
the complete NP gene of 12 swine influenza isolates.
The resulting sequences were submitted to the GenBank
database under accession numbers HM142746HM142757. Virus characteristics and GenBank accession numbers of NP gene sequences are shown in table
1. In addition, the NP gene sequences of Thai avian
(n = 25), human (n = 25), and swine (n = 14) influenza
viruses retrieved from the public database (GenBank)
were included in the analysis (Table 1).
Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic analysis of 76 different NP nucleotide
sequences of human (n = 25), avian (n = 25), swine
(n = 14) Thai isolates and one reference NP nucleotide
sequence of equine (n = 1) virus showed that the viruses
clustered in distinct lineages represented by the avian,

455 showed potentially human-specific characteristics
even though such amino acids can be found in either
avian or swine lineages (Table 3). Four amino acids
unique to Eurasian and classical swine lineages were
identified at positions 350 (350K/T), 371 (V/M), 444 (V/
I), and 456 (L/V). It should be noted that amino acids
potentially unique to the pandemic H1N1 2009 were
found at positions 100 (100I), 217 (217V), 313 (313V),
316(316M) and 425 (425V).

substitution rates of the NP gene in both Eurasian and
classical swine lineages viruses were high, amounting to
2.92 × 10-3 and 2.98 × 10-3, respectively. In addition, all
human lineages (seasonal H1N1, H3N2 and pandemic
H1N1) also displayed high nucleotide substitution rates
of the NP gene (Table 4). On the other hand, the substitution rate of the NP gene in avian viruses was half
(1.57 × 10-3) that of swine and human lineages, indicating the highly conserved nature or genetically static
stage of the NP gene of avian viruses compared to
human and swine viruses.

Nucleotide substitution rate of the NP gene

Nucleotide substitution rates of the NP gene in swine,
human and avian lineage viruses were calculated using
BEAST v1.4.7 applying the Bayesian Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (BMCMC). In this study, the nucleotide

reports have provided some NP gene sequences of swine
influenza viruses from Thailand [17,18]. However, none
of those NP gene sequences has been comprehensively
characterized. Since only 14 NP nucleotide sequences of
Thai swine viruses have been stored at the public database, the results obtained from this study could help
add significant information on swine influenza viruses in
Thailand.
Phylogenetic analysis of the NP gene of 76 selected
influenza viruses from Thailand and one representative
for the NP gene (A/Equine/Prague/1/56 (H7N7) confirmed distinct clusters of the NP gene as equine, avian,
human, European swine and classical swine lineages (Fig
1). The NP gene of influenza viruses has been distinguished into human and non-human groups [6-8]. Host
specific NP groups including equine 1, recent equine,
human-classical swine, H13 gull and avian differentiated
by both RNA hybridization and phylogenetic analysis
have been reported in previous studies [3,5]. Avian-like
swine (Eurasian swine) and classical swine lineages have
also been documented [19]. The result of this study
confirmed that the NP gene is highly conserved within
host-specific lineages. Most avian, human and swine
viruses in Thailand cluster within their specific host
ranges. For example, all avian influenza viruses as well
as human H5N1 viruses cluster in the avian lineage,
while seasonal human H1N1 and H3N2 are grouped
with a separate human lineage. It should be noted that
avian H5N1 viruses have been isolated from several
mammalian species such as humans, tigers, cats, dogs
and possibly other domestic animals. However these
H5N1 viruses displayed avian characteristics and were
grouped with the avian linage [20-22]. In addition, several studies have reported that the NP gene of pandemic
H1N1 2009 displays classical swine characteristics
[14,15]. Evidence of the pandemic H1N1 2009 human
viruses displaying a swine-like NP gene and of H5N1
human viruses containing an avian NP gene has suggested that the NP gene can be utilized for tracing interspecies transmission of animal Influenza A viruses to
humans. Further research conducted on the NP gene
from various animal species and humans with respect to
its host specificity could be useful for monitoring influenza A viruses.

None of the unique amino acids of NP lineages identified in this study is involved in RNA binding activities
[10]. They are mainly correlated with host specificity of
the viruses. Genetic analysis of the NP gene of the 12
swine influenza viruses has shown that the viruses display high nucleotide sequence identities similar to either
Eurasian swine or classical swine viruses. Four potentially unique amino acids specific to Eurasian and classical swine lineages but not avian or human lineages have
been identified at positions 350 (K/T), 371 (V/M), 444
(V/I), and 456 (L/V). In contrast, amino acids at positions 345 and 430 have been reported as amino acids
unique to the classical swine lineage [23]. Two amino
acids at positions 105 and 450 have been reported as
amino acids specific for avian lineages [19]. However
the research presented here has not established the
amino acid at position 405 (405V) as highly correlated
with the avian specific lineage as previously reported
(Table 3) [3]. This study has also analyzed at least 5
amino acid positions (16, 283, 293, 372, and 422) unique
to the human lineage indicating that 283P/283L are specific to human and avian lineages, respectively, as previously reported [24-26]. It has been known that the
amino acid at position 16 is related to the N-terminal
cleavage of the NP gene and correlated with the host
specificity of the virus [27]. The amino acid motif of the
NP gene of the human virus (ETD16G) is sensitive to
host protease, while that of avian and swine viruses
(ETG16G) is resistant [28,29]. Moreover, in this study,
we were able to identify at least 5 amino acids of the
NP gene (100, 217, 313, 316, and 425) unique to the
pandemic H1N1 2009 viruses. Previous studies analyzed
the NP gene of H1N1 2009 stored at the public database
and the result showed that the amino acids V100 and
V313 were highly conserved in the pandemic H1N1
2009 virus [30]. In addition, the tendency of a V to I
mutation in NP100 has also been previously reported,
similar to the finding in this study [26].

Conclusion
In conclusion, our study provided the nucleotide
sequences of the NP gene of 12 Thai swine influenza
viruses of subtypes H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2. Phylogenetic and genetic analysis of the swine, avian and

Thippamom et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:185

human influenza viruses confirmed the highly conserved
nature of the NP gene within host-specific lineages. The
NP gene of swine influenza viruses clustered with either
Eurasian swine or classical swine viruses indicating the
origins of the imported viruses. Unique amino acids specific to swine, avian and human influenza lineages were
identified. This research highlights the significance of
genetic variation of the NP gene from swine, avian and
human influenza viruses in Thailand.

ME). PCR products of interest were purified by the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). DNA sequencing was
carried out by dideoxynucleotide chain termination technique. Briefly, the sequencing reaction was performed
using Big Dye Terminator V3.0 Cycle Sequencing Ready
reaction (ABI, Foster city, CA) at a final volume of 20 ul
containing 1× reaction dye terminator and 3.2 pmol of
specific sequencing primers. The product of the sequencing reaction was analyzed in the ABI-Prism 310 Genetic
Analyzer (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT).

Materials and methods
Influenza A Virus from swine

The 12 swine influenza viruses in this study were isolated
from swine raised in Thailand between 2005 and 2009.
The viruses were obtained from swine farms in provinces
of the central region (Saraburi, Ratchaburi and Nakhon
Pathom) and eastern region (Chonburi and Chachoengsao) of Thailand. Virus isolation was performed as previously described [18]. The viruses were confirmed as
influenza A virus by one-step realtime RT-PCR with primers and probe specific to the M gene. The viruses were
then subtyped as H1N1 (n = 6), H1N2 (n = 1) and H3N2
(n = 5) by using primers specific to each subtype of swine
influenza viruses (list of primers is available upon
request). The viruses were propagated in Madin-Darby
canine kidney (MDCK) cells in minimal essential medium (MEM) (Hyclone, USA) with 5% fetal calf serum
(Hyclone) for 3 passages for further NP gene sequencing.
Complete NP gene sequencing

Viral RNA was extracted from cell culture by using a
QIAmp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
cDNA synthesis of viral RNA and amplification of the
NP gene by PCR were performed with specific primers
with some modifications (Hoffman et al., 2001). In brief,
cDNA synthesis was carried out by incubating the viral
RNA with 0.5 ug of random primers at 70°C for 5 min
and 4°C for 5 min. The mixture was added to 1× reaction
buffer (Promega, Madison WI), 0.5 mM dNTPs, 2.5 mM
MgCl2, 10 U of RNAsin Ribonuclease inhibitor and 1 U
of ImProm-II Reverse Transcriptase and incubated at 25°
C for 5 min, 42°C for 60 min and 70°C for 15 min.
Amplification of the NP gene was carried out in 50 ul of
PCR mixture by adding 4 ul of cDNA, 1× master mix
(ReadyMix PCR master mix, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
UK) and 0.5 umol of oligonucleotide primers specific to
the NP gene. The amplification reaction included an
initial denaturation step at 94°C for 3 min, followed by
40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at
55°C for 30 s and extension at 72°C for 30 s, and concluded by a final extension step at 72°C for 7 min. The
PCR products were mixed with loading buffer (2%
Orange G in 50% glycerol) and then separated by 1.5%
agarose gel electrophoresis (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland,

Analysis of genetic variation of the NP gene of Swine
influenza viruses

Nucleotide sequences were edited, validated and
assembled by using Chromas version 1.45 (Technelysium
Pty. Ltd., Australia), and SeqMan (DNASTAR, Madison,
WI). The complete nucleotide sequences of the NP gene
of influenza viruses from swine were submitted to the
GenBank database with accession numbers shown in
Table 1. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA
version 4 [31] using neighbor-joining method with Kimura
2-parameter. Bootstrap analysis was performed with 1000
replicates. The Bayesian tree was generated using the
MrBayes V.3.1.2 [32] with 1 million generations using
default heating parameters. The posterior probabilities
were calculated to confirm tree topology. Genetic analyses
for amino acid polymorphisms of the NP gene from
viruses isolated from different host species were performed
by amino acid alignments using the MegAlign program
(DNASTAR). Additional NP nucleotide sequences from
Thai seasonal H1N1 (n = 3), H3N2 (n = 8) and pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 (n = 8) from humans as well as those from
Thai HPAI (H5N1) from avian species (n = 24) and
humans (n = 6) were included for phylogenetic and
genetic analyses.
Nucleotide substitution rates of the NP gene

Nucleotide substitution rates of the NP gene of swine,
human and avian influenza A viruses recovered from
2003-2009 in Thailand were calculated using the computer program BEAST v1.4.7 applying the Bayesian
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) [33]. Each
nucleotide sequence was analyzed by codon-positionspecific HKY+Γ substitution model as well as clock
models (strict clock, uncorrelated relaxed clock and correlated relaxed clock). The BMCMC analysis was conducted with the parameters of at least 50 million states
with 1000 sampling intervals and the 10% of each chain
are ‘burn-in’ removed. The BMCMC analysis results
were shown using Tracer V1.4.
