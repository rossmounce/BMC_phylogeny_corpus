Efficient activation of T cells by human
monocyte-derived dendritic cells (HMDCs) pulsed
with Coxiella burnetii outer membrane protein
Com1 but not by HspB-pulsed HMDCs

Abstract
Background: Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular bacterium and the etiologic agent of Q fever; both coxiella
outer membrane protein 1 (Com1) and heat shock protein B (HspB) are its major immunodominant antigens. It is
not clear whether Com1 and HspB have the ability to mount immune responses against C. burnetii infection.
Results: The recombinant proteins Com1 and HspB were applied to pulse human monocyte-derived dendritic cells
(HMDCs), and the pulsed HMDCs were used to stimulate isogenic T cells. Com1-pulsed HMDCs expressed
substantially higher levels of surface molecules (CD83, CD40, CD80, CD86, CD54, and CD58) and a higher level of
interleukin-12 than HspB-pulsed HMDCs. Moreover, Com1-pulsed HMDCs induced high-level proliferation and
activation of CD4+ and CD8+ cells, which expressed high levels of T-cell activation marker CD69 and inflammatory
cytokines IFN-g and TNF-a. In contrast, HspB-pulsed HMDCs were unable to induce efficient T-cell proliferation and
activation.
Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that Com1-pulsed HMDCs are able to induce efficient T-cell proliferation and
drive T cells toward Th1 and Tc1 polarization; however, HspB-pulsed HMDCs are unable to do so. Unlike HspB,
Com1 is a protective antigen, which was demonstrated by the adoptive transfer of Com1-pulsed bone marrow
dendritic cells into naive BALB/c mice.

Background
Dendritic cells (DCs) are potent antigen-presenting cells
(APCs) that bridge the innate and adaptive immune
responses through direct pathogen neutralization, cytokine
production, and T-cell activation [1]. Activated DCs
express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I and
MHC II molecules and T-cell costimulatory molecules,
which possess the unique ability to activate naive T cells
[2,3]. Immature DCs (iDCs) reside in the peripheral epithelial tissues, where they serve as sentinels against invading
microorganisms [4]. Contact with a pathogen typically elicits stimulation of iDCs via pattern-recognition receptors,
such as the toll-like receptor (TLR), and subsequent

conversion of iDCs to mature DCs (mDCs) [5,6]. mDCs
exhibit a reduction in phagocytic ability and an increase in
surface expression of MHC II and costimulatory molecules,
and they switch in chemokine receptor expression, which
results in mDC migration to the local lymph nodes to
induce adaptive immunity [2,7,8].
Coxiella burnetii is a Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium, which survives inside large replication
vacuoles that display phagolysosomal characteristics [9,10].
C. burnetii is the etiologic agent of Q fever, a disease with
a worldwide distribution [11,12]. Acute Q fever is usually
self-limited in immunocompetent hosts, whereas the
chronic form of the disease develops in individuals defective in cell-mediated immunity [11,13]. Owing to its very
low infectious dose, known environment stability, and
aerosol transmission route, C. burnetii is recognized as a
potential biological weapon agent, and it has been classified
as a category B bioterrorism agent [13,14]. An inactivated

C. burnetii vaccine against acute Q fever is effective, but
the vaccination remains problematic owing to its significant side effects in individuals who have already had Q
fever [15]. Second-generation Q fever vaccine, offering significant relief from adverse reactions, has been developed
by means of chloroform-methanol extraction of phase I
organisms by Williams and colleagues [16,17]; however,
the complex procedure and biosecurity requirements in
dealing with the propagation and purification of C. burnetii
organisms are a hindrance to large-scale production.
A safe, effective subunit vaccine against Q fever would
clearly be desirable, and a number of potential protective
antigens have been identified toward developing such a
vaccine [18-22]. Among them, coxiella outer-membrane
protein 1 (Com1) and heat-shock protein B (HspB) were
strongly recognized by sera from Q fever patients or
C. burnetii-infected animals [20-22]. HspB is a member
of the Hsp60 family, and Hsp60 in Legionella pneumophila (a facultative intracellular pathogen largely similar
to C. burnetii in phylogenesis) is located in the periplasm
and outer membrane, and the surface-associated Hsp60
is involved in bacterial virulence [23,24]. Both Com1 and
HspB of C. burnetii are viewed as major immunodominant antigens and important surface-associated molecules that can interact with surface molecules of innate/
adaptive immune cells [18-20,25]. However, it is not clear
whether Com1 and HspB possess the ability to mount
immune responses against C. burnetii infection.
In the present study, the recombinant proteins Com1
and HspB were used to pulse human monocyte-derived
DCs (HMDCs) in vitro, and the maturation and activation status of the pulsed HMDCs were measured by
flow cytometry. Since the protective response to intracellular bacteria is mainly dependent on a cell-mediated
immune reaction, the pulsed HMDCs were used to stimulate isogenic T cells in vitro; the maturation and activation status of CD4 + and CD8 + cells in the T-cell
population were analyzed after interaction of the
HMDCs with the T cells. We found that Com1 induced
efficient maturation and activation of HMDCs and that
Com1-pulsed cells were able to initiate the adaptive Tcell response by skewing CD4+ and CD8+ cells toward,
respectively, the Th1 and Tc1 pathway. In contrast,
HspB elicited incomplete maturation of HMDCs, and
HspB-pulsed cells were unable to induce efficient T-cell
proliferation and activation.

Maturation and activation of HMDCs induced by Com1
and HspB

To determine the capability of Com1 and HspB to induce
maturation and activation of HMDCs, immature HMDCs
(iHMDCs) were treated with Com1, HspB, or Escherichia
coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24 h. The resulting populations of HMDCs were analyzed by flow cytometry to
determine their expression of surface molecules. As shown
in Figure 2, Com1-treated HMDCs exhibited substantially
increased expression of surface molecules, and the expression levels of surface molecules (CD40, CD54, CD58,
CD80, CD83, and CD86) were equal to or higher than
those of LPS-treated HMDCs. However, with HspB-treated HMDCs, CD83 expression remained at baseline levels,
while expression of the other surface molecules was much
lower than with Com1-pulsed HMDCs (Figure 2).

were stained with monoclonal antibody to CD83, CD80, CD54, CD86, CD40, or CD58 and the expression of the surface molecules was measured
by flow cytometry. LPS-treated HMDCs (red histograms) and mock-stimulated HMDCs (blue histograms) were applied as positive and negative
controls, respectively. The results are representative of three independent experiments, each using cells derived from a different donor.

Cytokine expression of HMDC elicited by Com1 and HspB

Antigen-activated DCs play an important role in controlling
differentiation orientation of naive T cells by differential
expression of IL-12 and IL-10. To investigate the possible
effector function of Com1- or HspB-pulsed HMDCs on T
cells, the production of intracellular IL-12p70 and IL-10
was determined in the antigen-treated HMDCs. As seen in
Figure 3, the percentages of IL-12 p70-positive cells in the
Com1-pulsed HMDCs were approximately 23-, 30-, and
35-fold higher, respectively, than in the mock-pulsed

HMDCs, LPS-pulsed HMDCs, and HspB-pulsed HMDCs.
The percentage of IL-12p70-positive cells in the HspBpulsed HMDCs was 36-fold lower than in the Com1-pulsed
HMDCs, whereas the percentage of IL-10-positive cells in
the HspB-pulsed HMDCs was threefold higher than in the
Com1-pulsed HMDCs (Figure 3).

CD4+ and CD8+ cells was determined by flow cytometry
after 12 h of interaction of T cells with antigen-pulsed
HMDCs (Figure 4). As a result, the percentages of CD4CD69 and CD8-CD69 double-positive cells among
T cells cocultured with Com1-pulsed HMDCs were 8.9and 14.2-fold higher, respectively, than those cocultured
with mock-pulsed HMDCs; the percentages of CD4CD69 and CD8-CD69 double-positive cells among
T cells cocultured with HspB-pulsed HMDCs were only
2.7- and 5.6-fold higher, respectively, than those cocultured with mock-pulsed HMDCs (Figure 4). The percentages of CD4-CD69 and CD8-CD69 double-positive
cells among T-cells cocultured with Com1-pulsed
HMDCs were 3.3- and 2.5-fold higher, respectively, than
those cocultured with HspB-pulsed HMDCs (Figure 4).
Cytokine production of T cells elicited by antigen-pulsed
HMDCs

To determine the differentiation orientation of T cells after
their interaction with antigen-pulsed HMDCs, the production of cytokines (IFN-g, TNF-a, and IL-10) was determined in CD4+ and CD8+ cells. The percentages of CD4IFN-g and CD8-IFN-g double-positive cells among T-cells
cocultured with Com1-pulsed HMDCs were 2.2- and 15.1-

fold higher, respectively, than those cocultured with HspBpulsed HMDCs (Figure 5). Meanwhile, the percentages of
CD4-TNF-a and CD8-TNF-a double-positive cells among
T cells cocultured with Com1-pulsed HMDCs were 24.1and 2.9-fold higher, respectively, than those cocultured
with HspB-pulsed HMDCs (Figure 6). Additionally, IL-10
expression of CD4+ and CD8+ cells among T cells treated
with Com1-pulsed HMDCs or HspB-pulsed HMDCs
remained at baseline levels (data not shown).
T-cell proliferation induced by antigen-pulsed HMDCs

T-cell proliferation induced by Com1- or HspB-pulsed
HMDCs was evaluated by carboxyfluorescein diacetate
succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-based proliferation assay after
96 h of interaction of T cells with antigen-pulsed
HMDCs. The proliferation rates of CD4 + and CD8 +
cells among T-cells cocultured with Com1-pulsed
HMDCs were 4.1- and 7.1-fold higher, respectively, than
those cocultured with HspB-pulsed HMDCs (Figure 7).

exhibited significantly lower coxiella burden; mice
receiving HspB-pulsed BMDCs displayed similar high
levels of coxiella burden after challenge with C. burnetii
(Figure 8). Coxiella burden in mice receiving HspBpulsed BMDCs was significantly higher than in those
receiving Com1-pulsed BMDCs; coxiella burden in animals receiving I Ag-pulsed BMDCs was much lower
than in mice receiving Com1-pulsed BMDCs (Figure 8).

Discussion
Com1 was first recognized as an immunoreactive protein associated with the outer membrane of C. burnetii
by Hendrix and colleagues [19], and it was identified as
a major immunodominant antigen of C. burnetii in
other studies [20,21]. HspB was similarly recognized as
a major immunodominant antigen of C. burnetii [20]
and was suggested as being a surface-associated protein
[24]. However, it is unclear whether Com1 and HspB
are able to mount specific immune responses, particularly a cell-mediated immune response against C. burnetii in humans.
In the present study, Com1 and HspB were applied to
stimulate HMDCs, and the antigen-pulsed HMDCs
were arranged to stimulate isogenic T cells. To explore
a possible mechanism of the immune response induced

by Com1 or HspB, the immune effector functions
(including T-cell activation-associated cytokines
expressed in the antigen-pulsed HMDCs and the cytokines associated with intracellular bactericidal activities
in the T cells activated by the antigen-pulsed HMDCs)
were measured by flow cytometry.
DCs are present in most tissues in an immature status,
and they undergo maturation upon antigen capture,
whereupon they migrate to the lymph nodes to elicit
adaptive immune responses [1]. In the present study,
the Com1-pulsed HMDCs exhibited increased expression of surface molecules, including the DC-maturation
marker (CD83), costimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80,
and CD86), and adhesion molecules (CD54 and CD58).
In addition, CD83, CD80, and CD86 are DC-maturation
markers, and thus their increased expression in Com1pulsed HMDCs suggests that Com1 has the ability to
induce efficient maturation of HMDCs.
These surface molecules expressed on mature HMDCs
may efficiently initiate the primary adaptive immune
response. During this response, naive T cells polarize
toward the antigen-presenting DCs, and a specific largescale molecular complex is built at the DC-T-cell interface [26]. T-cell activation is regulated primarily by signalling events that derive from the interaction between

Figure 6 TNF-a expression in CD4+ and CD8+ cells induced with antigen-pulsed HMDCs. TNF-a expression on CD4+ and CD8+ cells was
analyzed in T cells cocultured with antigen-pulsed HMDCs (Com1-DCs/HspB-DCs), mock-pulsed HMDCs (mock-DCs), or PHA (positive control) by
intracellular TNF-a staining. The percentages of double-positive cells among the T cells are indicated in the top-right corner, and the results are

the T-cell receptor (TCR) and the presented antigens on
DCs and the interaction between T-cell surface molecules (CD28, CD154, CD2, and CD11a) and costimulatory (CD40, CD80, and CD86) or adhesion molecules
(CD54 and CD58) on DCs [27]. The CD80/CD86-CD28
interaction provides important signals for T-cell activation and survival, and the CD40-CD154 interaction is
crucial for the development of CD4+ T-cell-dependent
effector functions; the interactions of both CD54-CD11a
and CD58-CD2 act as a central part in the clustering of
DCs and CD4 + T cells [27]. Therefore, the increased
expression of costimulatory and adhesion molecules on
Com1-activated HMDCs strongly indicates that Com1activated HMDCs possess the ability to induce efficient
proliferation and activation of naive T cells.
T-cell proliferation induced by antigen-treated HMDCs
was measured by flow cytometry of CFSE dye dilution.
Our results showed that the proliferation levels of CD4+
and CD8+ cells in T cells cocultured with Com1-activated
HMDCs were significantly higher than those cocultured
with mock-pulsed HMDCs. This suggests that Com1-activated HMDCs efficiently stimulated naive T cells to
expand the populations of both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets
before acquiring T-cell effector function.

It is well established that antigen-activated DCs can
regulate the balance of Th1 and Th2 by differential
expression between IL-12 and IL-10. If IL-12 is much
higher than IL-10, the naive T cells will be skewed
toward the Th1 phenotype; conversely, if IL-10 is much
higher than IL-12, the naive T cells will differentiate
toward the Th2 phenotype. In the present study, high
IL-12p70 and low IL-10 expression were found in
Com1-pulsed HMDCs, which suggests that Com1-activated HMDCs possess the ability to drive T cells toward
Th1 differentiation through the Th1-specific cytokine
IL-12.
To demonstrate the capability of Com1-pulsed HMDCs
to activate T cells, the T-cell activation marker CD69 on
CD4+ and CD8+ cells was determined after T-cell interaction with Com1-pulsed HMDCs. Our results showed that
the percentages of CD4-CD69 and CD8-CD69 doublepositive cells among T cells that interacted with Com1pulsed HMDCs were much greater than those that interacted with mock-pulsed HMDCs. This firmly suggests
that both CD4+ and CD8+ cells are efficiently activated
through strong accessory signals derived from the surfacemolecule interactions between Com1-activated HMDCs
and T cells.

Figure 7 Proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ cells in response to antigen-treated HMDCs. The CFSE-stained T cells were stimulated with
antigen-treated HMDCs (Com1-DCs/HspB-DCs), mock-pulsed HMDCs (Mock-DCs), or PHA (positive control) for 96 h. The results are representative
of three independent experiments, each using cells derived from a different donor.

Laboratory studies have demonstrated that protection
against C. burnetii infection is conferred by a Th1-oriented
immune response, which depends on the Th1-specific
cytokine IFN-g and inflammatory cytokine TNF-a since
both cytokines have the ability to upregulate the bactericidal activity of macrophages [28,29]. In the present study,
Th1-specific cytokine IFN-g and Th2-specific cytokine
IL-10 as well as inflammatory cytokine TNF-a were determined in T cells after exposure to Com1-activated
HMDCs. Our results showed that the expression of IFN-g
and TNF-a in CD4 + and CD8 + cells was dramatically
increased after T-cell interaction with Com1-pulsed
HMDCs. However, the IL-10 expression in CD4 + and
CD8+ cells in this T-cell population remained at baseline
levels. These results strongly imply that Com1-pulsed
HMDCs have the ability to drive differentiation of naive
CD4+ and CD8+ cells toward, respectively, CD4+ Th1 and
CD8+ Tcl cells and that HMDC-activated CD4+ and CD8+

cells may produce IFN-g and TNF-a to enhance the
intracellular bactericidal activity of the host cells
(macrophages).
To demonstrate the immunoprotective ability of
Com1, Com1-pulsed BMDCs were adaptively transferred
to naive mice. Our results showed that mice receiving
Com1-pulsed BMDCs exhibited significantly lower coxiella burden than control animals after challenge with
virulent C. burnetii. However, the coxiella burden in
mice receiving HspB-pulsed BMDCs was significantly
higher than in those receiving Com1-pulsed BMDCs.
This suggests that HspB is not a protective antigen.
We found that HspB was unable to induce efficient
maturation and activation of HMDCs. The expressions
of maturation marker (CD83), costimulatory (CD40,
CD80, and CD86), and adhesion molecules (CD54 and
CD58) of HspB-pulsed HMDCs were much lower than
those of Com1-pulsed HMDCs. Moreover, HspB-pulsed

antigen-pulsed BMDCs. Coxiella DNA copies were determined in
five mouse samples per group by quantitative PCR. Data are
expressed as the average copy number of five samples, and error
bars indicate the standard deviation. Mice receiving phase I Agpulsed BMDCs (I Ag) and mock-pulsed BMDCs (Mock) were used as
positive and negative controls, respectively. In quantitative PCR
analysis, the copy number per mouse was obtained with 1% of the
DNA sample extracted from 10 mg spleen tissue. Coxiella burden in
mice receiving Com1-pulsed BMDCs was significantly lower than in
mice receiving HspB-pulsed BMDCs (P<0.05). This result is from one
independent experiment.

HMDCs produced much lower levels of IL-12, but
much higher levels of IL-10, than Com1-pulsed
HMDCs. The increased expression of IL-10 in DCs may
inhibit T-cell proliferation [30,31]. Similarly, Motta et al.
[32] showed that Mycobacterium tuberculosis Hsp70
inhibited T-cell proliferation in vitro, since it impaired
DC maturation and induced high production of IL-10 in
DCs; this suggests that Hsp70 does not have inflammatory potential but rather immunosuppressive properties.
In this study, the percentages of CD8-CD69 and CD4CD69 double-positive cells among T cells cocultured
with HspB-pulsed HMDCs were much lower than those
cocultured with Com1-pulsed HMDCs. HspB-pulsed
HMDCs caused a negligible proliferation of CD8+ and
CD4+ cells, which suggests that the low-level expression
of costimulatory molecules and adherence molecules of
HspB-pulsed HMDCs was unable to activate the T cells.
Generally, the interaction between the innate/adaptive
immune system and invading C. burnetii is sufficient to
eradicate the organisms, which elicit asymptomatic or
mild, self-limiting, flu-like symptoms in most human
C. burnetii infections. The bactericidal immune response
is mainly based on inflammatory cytokines IFN-g and
TNF-a [33,34]. However, a variety of pathogens can take
advantage of the anti-inflammatory properties of IL-10
(which is crucial for maintaining the subtle balance
between immunity against pathogens and a pathology that

Page 8 of 12

can arise when an immune response is left unchecked) as
a mean of avoiding sterilizing immunity and establishing a
persistent infection [35-37]. In C. burnetii infections, IL-10
is believed to have the ability to disarm bactericidal
responses and contribute to chronic development of
C. burnetii infection. Previous studies [38,39] showed that
IL-10 promoted replication of C. burnetii in human monocytes and C. burnetii established a more robust infection
in IL-10-overexpressing transgenic mice owing to the
macrophages failing to kill the bacteria. Another study
revealed that IL-10 overproduction was involved in establishing persistent C. burnetii infections and was related to
Q fever endocarditis development [40]. Clearly, IL-10
plays an important role in persistent C. burnetii infection.
Therefore, the high level of anti-inflammatory cytokine
IL-10 generated in HspB-pulsed HMDCs may be an
important factor in inhibiting proliferation and activation
of T cells.
In our recent study, adaptive transfer of mouse BMDCs
stimulated with coxiella antigens into BABL/c mice
showed that the coxiella burden in animals receiving
Com1-pulsed BMDCs was significantly lower than in mice
receiving EnhA-pulsed BMDCs [41]. Although both Com1
and EnhA had the ability to activate BMDCs to express
MHC-II and costimulatory molecules, CD4+ T cells from
mice receiving Com1-pulsed BMDCs exhibited significantly higher CD69 expression than animals receiving
EnhA-pulsed BMDCs after coculture with homologous
antigen-pulsed BMDCs. In addition, the percentages of
CD4+ and IFN-g double-positive cells in mice receiving
Com1-pulsed BMDCs were significantly higher than in
animals receiving EnhA-pulsed BMDCs; the percentages
of CD4+ and IL-17 double-positive cells in mice receiving
Com1-BMDCs were significantly higher than in mice
receiving EnhA-pulsed BMDCs [41]. However, the percentages of regulatory T lymphocytes in mice receiving
Com1-pulsed BMDCs were substantially lower than in
animals receiving EnhA-pulsed BMDCs [41]. Our results
suggest that the protection offered by Com1-pulsed
BMDCs is correlated with the increased proliferation of
Th1 CD4+ T cells, preferential development of Th17 cells,
and impaired expansion of regulatory T lymphocytes [41].

Conclusions
Our results demonstrate that Com1 is able to induce
complete maturation and activation of HMDCs that
drive T cells toward Th1 and Tc1 polarization; however,
HspB-induced incompletely mature HMDCs are unable
to induce efficient T-cell proliferation and activation.
Unlike HspB, Com1 is a potent protective antigen of C.
burnetii, which has been demonstrated by adoptive
transfers of Com1-pulsed and HspB-pulsed BMDCs into
naive BALB/c mice.

Methods
Preparation of whole-cell antigen and recombinant
proteins

C. burnetii Xinqiao strain (phase I) isolated from ticks in
China [42] was propagated in embryonated eggs, inactivated with formalin, and purified by renografin density
centrifugation, as described previously [16]. The purified
coxiella cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) buffer as a phase I antigen (I Ag). Recombinant proteins, Com1 and HspB, were prepared in our laboratory
according to described methods [20]. Briefly, the com1
gene was amplified from C. burnetii (Xinqiao strain) genomic DNA with a pair of primers: primer 1 (5’-ATCGGATCCTTAGCCGGAACCTTGACC-3’) with the
BamHI restriction site; and primer 2 (5’-GCCCTCGAGTAACGCTTTATTACCAATGACG-3’) with the XhoI
restriction site. The amplified gene fragment was cloned
into a prokaryotic expression plasmid, pET-32a, by the
restriction sites. E. coli BL21 cells were transformed by
com1-recombined pET-32a. The hspB gene was amplified
from C. burnetii genomic DNA with the other primer
pair: primer 1 (5’-GCCGAGCTCGTGACGTTGGGACCAAAAGG-3’) with the SacI restriction site; and primer 2
(5’-ATACTGCAGCCGCCCATTCCTCCCATGCC-3’)
with the PstI restriction site. The amplified gene fragment
was cloned into a prokaryotic-expression plasmid pQE30
by the restriction sites.
E. coli M15 cells were transformed by hspB-recombined
pQE30. The transformed bacterial cells were grown to an
optical density (OD 600 = 0.6) at 37°C in Luria-Bertani
broth, containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and then induced
for 4 h with 0.5 mM isopropyl b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG,
Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). The recombinant
proteins containing six consecutive histidine residues were
purified from the cellular debris of the transformed E. coli
cells using the nickel-nitrilotriacetic resin affinity chromatography kit (QIAexpressionist, Qiagen GmbH, Germany)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The recombinant proteins Com1 and HspB were identified in SDSPAGE (Figure 1A) and recognized using the sera from
BALB/c mice experimentally infected with C. burnetii in
an immunoblot assay (Figure 1B).
The purified recombinant proteins were treated with Triton X-114 (Amresco, Solon, OH, USA) to remove LPS, as
described previously [43]. In brief, 5 μl Triton X-114 was
added to 500 μl recombinant protein solution (1 μg/ml),
and then the mixture was vigorously shaken in a vortex
mixer for several seconds. The mixture was kept on ice for
5 min and then incubated at 37°C for 5 min. Finally, the
mixture was briefly centrifuged, and the supernatant was
collected. This procedure was repeated three times. Each
LPS-removed protein was concentrated with a concentrator
(VivaScience, Hannover, Germany), and the concentrated

Page 9 of 12

protein was diluted with the elution buffer in the affinity
chromatography kit to make a protein solution (400 μg/
ml). The recombinant proteins were used only when the
LPS level was below 0.005 endotoxin units (EU)/ml, determined using the Limulus amoebocyte assay (Sigma-Aldrich,
St Louis, MO, USA).
Isolation and culture of cells

The human blood samples in this study were obtained
from three healthy donors in our research group who
clearly knew the purpose of this study, according to the
Blood Donation Law of the People’s Republic of China.
This study was approved by the ethics committee of the
Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology.
HMDCs were generated from human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs), as described previously [44].
In brief, PBMCs were isolated from blood buffy coats of
healthy donors by Ficoll-Paque Plus (Haoyang Biotech,
Beijing, China) density-gradient centrifugation, and the
monocyte and T-cell fractions were obtained from PBMCs
by Percoll density-gradient centrifugation (Haoyang Biotech, Beijing, China), according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Residual lymphocytes were removed from the
monocyte fraction by plastic adherence in 12-well plates
(Costar, Corning, NY, USA), and the purity of the collected
monocytes (CD14+) was greater than 90%, as determined
by flow cytometry. The isogeneic T cells were collected
from the supernatants, and more than 90% of the collected
cells were CD3-positive in flow cytometric analysis.
The adherence monocytes were cultured with RPMI
1640 medium (Hyclone, Beijing, China) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Beijing,
China), 50 ng/ml human IL-4 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ,
USA), and 50 ng/ml human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; PeproTech) at 37°C and
5% CO2. IL-4 and GM-CSF were added to the cultured
cells every other day. After 5 days of culture, more than
95% of the cells had converted to immature HMDCs
(iHMDCs), with a phenotype of CD11c+, CD54 low, CD83
low
, CD40 low, CD58 low, CD86low, and CD80low, as determined by flow cytometry.
Approximately 1 × 106 iHMDCs was added to each well
of a six-well plate; they were then treated with Com1
(20 μg/ml), HspB (20 μg/ml), E. coli LPS (6 μg/ml; SigmaAldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), and 50 μl elution buffer
(mock pulse) for 24 h at 37°C. After 24 h of antigen stimulation, the HMDCs were harvested by centrifugation at
500 × g for 5 min, and their maturation and activation status were determined by flow cytometry, as described below.
Flow cytometric assay

The harvested HMDCs were suspended in PBS containing 5% FBS, and the following monoclonal antibodies

Wang et al. BMC Immunology 2011, 12:52
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/12/52

(mAbs) were used to characterize the cell phenotypes
(BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA, USA): anti-CD11c-APC,
anti-CD58-FITC, anti-CD80-PE, anti-CD40-FITC, antiCD83-PE, anti-CD54-PE, and anti-CD86-PE. In parallel,
HMDCs were immunostained with the isotype-matched
control mAb. Approximately 1 × 10 6 HMDCs were
immunostained with three-color antibodies in 50 μl PBS
containing 5% FBS. The HMDCs were incubated with
different antibodies at room temperature for 15 min.
After washing, 1% paraformaldehyde was added to fix
the stained HMDCs. Samples were run on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA)
and analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA, USA).
Intracellular cytokine detection by flow cytometry

After 20 h of antigen stimulation, HMDCs were incubated
for 4 h with brefeldin A solution (1 μl/106 cells), and then
the HMDCs were harvested and washed twice in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The brefeldintreated HMDCs were stained with anti-CD11c-APC for
15 min at room temperature. After one fixing step with
FACS lysing solution, HMDCs were permeabilized and
immunostained with PE-conjugated anti-cytokine antibody (anti-IFN-a, anti-IL-12p70, or anti-IL-10) or isotypematched control mAb for 30 min at room temperature.
After 20 h of incubation with the antigen-pulsed
HMDCs, the T cells were incubated with brefeldin A for
4 h. After washing, the T cells were stained with antiCD3-PerCP, anti-CD4-APC/anti-CD8-APC, anti-IFN-gFITC, anti-TNF-a-PE, or anti-IL-10-PE by the method
described above. After washing, the stained cells were
collected and suspended in PBS, and the different cytokine expression in HMDCs, CD4 + , or CD8+ cells was
determined by flow cytometry.
Measurement of early T-cell activation

After 12 h of incubation with the antigen-treated HMDCs,
the T cells were stained with anti-CD3-PerCP, anti-CD4APC/anti-CD8-APC, and anti-CD69-PE in 50 μl PBS containing 5% FBS at room temperature for 15 min. After
washing, 1% paraformaldehyde was added to fix the
stained cells, and then the CD69 expression on the CD4+
or CD8+ cells was determined by flow cytometry. In parallel, the cells were stained with isotype-matched control
mAb.
T-cell proliferation assay
7

Approximately 5 × 10 T cells in 1 ml PBS was mixed with
10 μM CFSE (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA), and then the
cells were incubated at 37°C for 10 min in the dark. After
incubation, 10 ml PBS containing 5% FBS was added to
each sample, followed by 5 min of incubation on ice. After
three washes in PBS, the cells were harvested by

Page 10 of 12

centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min. Approximately 1 ×
105 CFSE-labelled responder cells was incubated with 1 ×
104 antigen-pulsed HMDCs at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 96 h.
The CFSE-labelled responder cells were stimulated with
PHA (10 μg/ml) for 96 h as a positive control. After incubation, the cells were harvested and stained with antiCD3-PerCP and anti-CD4-APC/anti-CD8-APC. CFSElabelled responder cell proliferation in CD4+ or CD8+ cells
was determined by flow cytometry, and the proliferation
percentages of the T-cell fractions were calculated by
ModFit software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).
Immunoprotection analysis of Com1- and HspB-pulsed
BMDCs

Mouse bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs, CD11c+)
were isolated from the bone marrow of BALB/c mice,
according to the protocol described previously [45]. Briefly,
a single-cell suspension from the bone marrow was prepared from mouse femurs and cultured in a complete 1640
medium, containing 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 U/ml penicillin at 37°C and 5% CO2. Approximately 1 × 106 cells was added to each well of a six-well
plate, and mouse GM-CSF (20 ng/ml; Peprotech) and IL-4
(10 ng/ml; Peprotech) was added to the culture medium
every other day. After 6 days of culture, BMDCs were stimulated with C. burnetii I Ag (10 μg/ml), Com1 (10 μg/
ml), HspB (10 μg/ml), E. coli LPS (2 μg/ml), or 25 μl elution
buffer (mock pulse) for 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO2.
After antigen stimulation, the antigen-pulsed BMDCs
were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected into BALB/c mice (6
weeks age, female; 5 × 105 cells/mouse). Fourteen days
after the BMDCs injection, mice were i.p. challenged with
C. burnetii Xinqiao strain (1 × 106 cells/mouse) in Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory. Mice were sacrificed on day 7
post-challenge, and their spleens were harvested for detection of C. burnetii burden by a quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) analysis [41,46]. For each mouse, 10
mg of spleen tissue was used to extract DNA with DNeasy
Blood &Tissue kit (Qiagen, Germany), and the purified
DNA was eluted from the column with 200 μl elution buffer. The data analysis was performed using SPSS software
(version 10.0; SPSS). Group comparison was performed
with the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test.
Values were expressed as means with standard deviations
(SDs). P values of <0.05 were considered significant.
