Abstract
The discovery and genome analysis of Acanthamoeba polyphaga Mimivirus, the largest known DNA
virus, challenged much of the accepted dogma regarding viruses. Its particle size (>400 nm), genome
length (1.2 million bp) and huge gene repertoire (911 protein coding genes) all contribute to blur
the established boundaries between viruses and the smallest parasitic cellular organisms.
Phylogenetic analyses also suggested that the Mimivirus lineage could have emerged prior to the
individualization of cellular organisms from the three established domains, triggering a debate that
can only be resolved by generating and analyzing more data. The next step is then to seek some
evidence that Mimivirus is not the only representative of its kind and determine where to look for
new Mimiviridae. An exhaustive similarity search of all Mimivirus predicted proteins against all
publicly available sequences identified many of their closest homologues among the Sargasso Sea
environmental sequences. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses suggested that unknown large viruses
evolutionarily closer to Mimivirus than to any presently characterized species exist in abundance
in the Sargasso Sea. Their isolation and genome sequencing could prove invaluable in understanding
the origin and diversity of large DNA viruses, and shed some light on the role they eventually played
in the emergence of eukaryotes.

Introduction
The discovery and genome sequence analysis of Mimivirus [1,2], the largest of the Nucleo-cytoplasmic Large DNA
Viruses (NCLDV), challenged much of the accepted
dogma regarding viruses. Its particle size (>400 nm),
genome length (1.2 million bp) and extensive gene repertoire (911 protein coding genes) all contribute to blur the
established boundaries between viruses and the smallest
parasitic cellular organisms such as Mycoplasma or
Nanoarchea [2]. In the universal tree of life, the Mimivirus
lineage appears to define a new branch, predating the
emergence of all established eukaryotic kingdoms [2].
Although this result is compatible with various hypothe-

ses implicating ancestral DNA viruses in the emergence of
eukaryotes [3-5], it requires confirmation from additional
data. An urgent task is thus to convince ourselves that
Mimivirus is not the sole representative of its kind (i.e. a
viral counterpart to the platypus) and to provide some
rational guidance as to where to begin the search for eventual new Mimiviridae.
Mimivirus was serendipitously discovered within Acanthamoeba polyphaga, a free-living ubiquitous amoeba, prevalent in aquatic environments. Phylogenetic analysis of
the most conserved genes common to all nucleo-cytoplasmic large double-stranded DNA viruses (NCLDV) [6]

sequences, 138 (15%) of the 911 Mimivirus ORFs were
found to exhibit their closest match (Blastp E-values ranging from 10-74 to 10-4 [8]) to environmental sequences
(see Additional file 1). Even before the discovery of Mimivirus, increasingly complex large double-stranded DNA
viruses have been isolated, in particular from unicellular
algae. The genome analysis of these Phycodnaviruses
revealed a variety of genes encoding enzymes from totally
unexpected metabolic pathways [9]. Mimivirus added
more unexpected genes (such as translation system components [2]) to this list. As the gene repertoire of these
large viruses and the gene content of cellular organisms
become increasingly comparable, we have to be cautious
in the interpretation of environmental/metagenomics
sequence data. To focus our study on environmental

organisms most likely to be viruses, we limited further
analyses to Mimivirus homologues member of the
NCLDV core gene sets [2,6]. These core genes are subdivided into four classes from the most (class I) to least
(class IV) evolutionarily conserved [6]. Seven of 10 Mimivirus Class I core genes (L206 to R400) have their closest
homologues in the Sargasso Sea data. This is also the case
for 3 of 7 class II (R450-R313)core genes, 3 of the 13 class
III core genes (R429-L364) and 7 of the 16 Class IV core
genes (L4-R301) (Table 1). Overall, 43% of Mimivirus
core genes have their closest homologues in the Sargasso
Sea data set. To further assess the viral nature of these
unknown microbes, we studied the phylogenetic relationships between the corresponding Mimivirus proteins,
their Sargasso Sea homologues, and the closest homo-

As of today, genes encoding capsid proteins are among the
most unequivocal genes of viral origin. Except for cases of
integrated proviral genomes, no cellular homologues of
viral capsid proteins have ever been found. During our
study, the closest homologues of Mimivirus capsid proteins were found to be capsid protein genes of environmental origin. For example, Mimivirus capsid protein
(R441) was found to be 48.5% identical to an unknown
environmental sequence, when it is only 36.2% identical
to the major capsid protein Vp49 of Chlorella virus CVG1, its best match among known viruses (Figure 3). As the
environmental capsid protein sequence also shares 44.5%
identical residues with the CVG-1 Vp49, the corresponding uncharacterized virus appears to lie at an equal evolutionary distance from the Mimiviridae and the
Phycodnaviridae.

Discussion

logues in other NCLDVs (see Materials and Methods). Figure 1a–c exhibits three independent phylogenic trees
computed using the MEGA3 software [10] for Mimivirus
ORFs R449 (unknown function), R429 (unknown function) and L437 (putative virion packaging ATPase). Figure
1a shows that the closest environmental R449 homologues cluster with Mimivirus separately from the known
phycodnaviruses, while other Sargasso Sea homologues
cluster in a way suggesting the presence of a new clade distinct from Phycodnaviridae. The tree based on R429 and
L437 (Fig. 1b,c) similarly suggests the presence of close
Mimivirus relatives not belonging to the Phycodnaviridae
or Iridoviridae clades.
Another piece of evidence substantiating the existence of
an unknown Mimivirus relative in the Sargasso Sea is the
discovery of contigs built from the data that contain multiple genes with a high degree of similarity to Mimivirus
genes. A spectacular case is illustrated in Figure 2. Here, a
4.5 kb scaffold (See Materials and Method) exhibits 4
putative ORFs. When compared to the whole nr database,
each of them has as a best match 4 distinct Mimivirus
ORFs: thiol oxidoreductase R368 (29% identical, E-value
< 10-9), NTPase-like L377 (25% identical, E-value < 10-20),
unknown function L375 (34% identical, E-value < 10-30),
and DNA repair enzyme L687 (40% identical, E-value <
10-62). Moreover, the gene order is conserved for three of
them (R368, L375, L377). Such colinearity is rarely
observed between viral genomes except for members of
the same family. Unfortunately, the sequences of these
genes are not conserved enough to allow the construction
of informative phylogenic trees that would include other
NCLDV orthologues.

Our results predict that DNA viruses of 0.1 to 0.8 microns
in size exist in the Sargasso Sea that are evolutionarily
closer to Mimivirus than to any presently characterized
species. These viruses are abundant enough to have been
collected by environmental sampling. It must be noticed
that a similar approach attempting to find relatives to two
other unique NCLDVs, the African swine fever virus (the
unique member of Asfarviridae) and the White spot
syndrome virus, a major shrimp pathogen (the sole
Nimaviridae), failed to provide convincing results (Claverie, data not shown). The identification of numerous
Mimivirus-like sequences in the Sargasso Sea data is thus
not simply the result of a large number of sequences been
compared, but truly suggests that viruses from this clade
are specifically abundant in the sampled marine environment. It is actually expected that many novel viruses will
be encountered in natural waters in which they constitute
the most abundant microrganisms [11,12]. There might
be as many as 10 billion virus particles per litre of ocean
surface waters [13]. Interestingly, the specialized literature
abounds of descriptions of large virus-like particle associated with algae [e.g. [14-16]], or various marine protists
[17,18]. With the exception of Phycodnaviruses [19-21],
the genomic characterization of these viruses has not been
attempted. Guided by the results presented here, their isolation and genome sequencing could prove invaluable in
understanding the diversity of DNA viruses and the role
they eventually played in the evolution of eukaryotes.

Materials and methods
The protocols used to collect Sargasso Sea environmental
micro-organisms and generate DNA sequences from these
samples has been described elsewhere [7]). The data analyzed here correspond to "bacteria-sized" organisms that
have passed through 3 µm filters and been retained by 0.8
µm to 0.1 µm filters. Mimivirus-like particles (0.8–0.4
µm) belong in this range.

residues (indicated in red or green) with the N-terminus of a capsid protein from an unknown large virus sampled from the
Sargasso Sea (Accession: EAD00518). On the other hand, the CVG-1 Vp49 and the Sargasso Sea sequence share 44.5% identical residues. By comparison, the CVG-1 Vp49 protein share 72% of identical residue with PBCV-1 Vp54, its best matching
homologue among known phycodnaviruses.

Database similarity searches were performed using the
Blast suite of programs [8] (default options) as implemented on the http://www.giantvirus.org web server and
as implemented at The Institute for Genomic Research.
Final similarity searches were performed on the nonredundant peptide sequence databases (nr) and environmental data (env-nr) downloaded from the National
Institute for Biotechnology Information ftp server ftp://
ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/ on March 14, 2005. To
avoid missing potential better matches with annotated
virus ORFs, all Mimivirus ORFs exhibiting a best match
(blosum62 scoring scheme) in env-nr were also searched
against all DNA virus genomes using TblastN (peptide
query against translated nucleotide sequence). The comprehensive list of Mimivirus ORFs exhibiting a best match
in the env-nr database is given in Additional file: 1.
Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using MEGA version 3.0 [10] (option: Neighbor joining, 250 pseudo-rep-

licates, and gaps handled by pairwise deletion). Tree
branches were condensed for bootstrap values <50%.
Only Mimivirus ORFs with best matching homologues in
DNA viruses and belonging to the nucleo-cytoplasmic
large DNA virus core gene set (2, 6) were analyzed in
detail. These ORFs (and matching status) are listed in
Table 1. Phylogenetic analyses were limited to viral homologues and environmental sequences exhibiting a reciprocal best match relationship with the corresponding
Mimivirus ORF (putative orthologues) (YES in the
rightmost column). The three cases (red lines in Table 1)
exhibiting the best bootstrap values are shown in Figure 1.
Cases of complex relationships, for instance due to the
presence of many paralogues (e.g. capsid proteins), are
also indicated. These cases of non-reciprocal best matches
are frequent (i.e. the closest homologue of a Mimivirus
ORFs being an environmental sequence, but the latter

to an assembly error.
