Abstract
Background: Prader-Willi and Angelman syndrome (PWS and AS) patients typically have an ~5 Mb deletion of human
chromosome 15q11-q13, of opposite parental origin. A mouse model of PWS and AS has a transgenic insertion-deletion
(TgPWS/TgAS) of chromosome 7B/C subsequent to paternal or maternal inheritance, respectively. In this study, we
define the deletion endpoints and examine the impact on expression of flanking genes.
Results: Using molecular and cytological methods we demonstrate that 13 imprinted and 11 non-imprinted genes are
included in the TgPWS/TgAS deletion. Normal expression levels were found in TgPWS brain for genes extending 9.1or 5.6-Mb centromeric or telomeric of the deletion, respectively. Our molecular cytological studies map the proximal
deletion breakpoint between the Luzp2 and Siglec-H loci, and we show that overall mRNA levels of Luzp2 in TgPWS and
TgAS brain are significantly reduced by 17%. Intriguingly, 5' Chrna7 shows 1.7-fold decreased levels in TgPWS and TgAS
brain whereas there is a ≥15-fold increase in expression in neonatal liver and spleen of these mouse models. By isolating
a Chrna7-Tg fusion transcript from TgAS mice, we mapped the telomeric deletion breakpoint in Chrna7 intron 4.
Conclusion: Based on the extent of the deletion, TgPWS/TgAS mice are models for PWS/AS class I deletions. Other
than for the first gene promoters immediately outside the deletion, since genes extending 5.6–9.1 Mb away from each
end of the deletion show normal expression levels in TgPWS brain, this indicates that the transgene array does not induce
silencing and there are no additional linked rearrangements. Using gene expression, non-coding conserved sequence
(NCCS) and synteny data, we have genetically mapped a putative Luzp2 neuronal enhancer responsible for ~33% of allelic
transcriptional activity. The Chrna7 results are explained by hypothesizing loss of an essential neuronal transcriptional
enhancer required for ~80% of allelic Chrna7 promoter activity, while the Chrna7 promoter is upregulated in B
lymphocytes by the transgene immunoglobulin enhancer. The mapping of a putative Chrna7 neuronal enhancer inside the
deletion has significant implications for understanding the transcriptional regulation of this schizophrenia-susceptibility
candidate gene.

Background
Prader-Willi and Angelman syndrome (PWS and AS) are
complex neurobehavioral disorders associated with loss
of function of a cluster of differentially expressed
imprinted genes in chromosome 15q11-q13 [1]. PWS is
characterized by a neonatal stage of failure to thrive, hypotonia and respiratory distress followed by hyperphagia in
early childhood with development of severe obesity, as
well as short stature, hypogonadism, small hands and
feet, mild to moderate mental retardation, and obsessivecompulsive behavior [2,3]. In contrast, AS patients have a
more pronounced neurological disease including developmental delay, severe mental retardation with lack of
speech, hyperactivity, seizures, aggressive behavior and
excessive inappropriate laughter [2]. Most PWS and AS
cases (~70%) are due to ~5 Mb de novo deletions spanning
a 2 Mb imprinted domain and several adjacent nonimprinted genes [1]. There are two classes of deletions in
PWS/AS patients, one from breakpoint 1 (BP1) to BP3
and the other from BP2 to BP3 [4]. Additionally, paternal
or maternal uniparental disomy (pat or matUPD) explain
25% of PWS and 5% of AS cases, respectively, while 2–5%
of PWS and AS cases result from imprinting defects (ID).
In each mechanism, PWS arises from loss of ten paternally
expressed loci, while AS arises from loss of function of the
maternally expressed UBE3A gene [1].
Mouse models of PWS with either matUPD [5], an ID [6]
or a paternally-inherited chromosome deletion [7] share
a similar phenotype with failure to thrive, hypotonia and
early postnatal lethality, modeling the first stage of the
human syndrome [9,10]. Similarly, mouse models of AS
have a patUPD [10], maternally-inherited chromosome
deletion [7], or a maternal mutation of Ube3a [11,12]. In
the transgenic (Tg) deletion mouse model, an Epstein Barr
Virus LMP2A transgene integrated with ~80 copies into
mouse chromosome 7B/C and created an ~5 Mb deletion
of the mouse region homologous to the human PWS/AS
genes (see Fig. 1A,B) [7]. As in human, the phenotype of
the deletion mouse model depends on the parental origin: paternal or maternal inheritance of the Tg-deletion,
respectively, results in the TgPWS mouse model characterized by severe neonatal hypoglycemia and early lethality
[9] or in TgAS mice with a mild neurobehavioral phenotype and late onset obesity [7].
Previous imprinted gene expression studies and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that the Tg
insertion-deletion comprised all of the orthologs of PWS
and AS imprinted genes and of several flanking nonimprinted genes [Fig. 1A; [7,13,14]]. In addition, brain
microarray and quantitative gene expression analyses confirmed the loss of expression of several imprinted genes
(Snurf-Snrpn, Ndn, Magel2, Mkrn3) and 50% reduced
expression of two non-imprinted loci (Herc2, Cyfip1) in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/157

TgPWS mouse brain, and demonstrated that an unidentified non-imprinted locus within the deletion acted in
trans to regulate a chromosome 18B3 gene expression
domain [15]. To define the exact characteristics of the
transgene insertion-deletion TgPWS/TgAS mouse model,
we have now determined the extent of the deletion and
the effect of the Tg-insertion and deletion on expression of
flanking genes. We delineated the deletion breakpoint
positions between Siglec-H and Luzp2 at the centromeric
end and within intron 4 of Chrna7 at the telomeric end.
Most importantly, we describe tissue-specific positional
effects of the Tg insertion and/or deletion on Luzp2 and
Chrna7 expression which are likely due to the presence or
absence of specific enhancer elements.

Results
FISH refines the TgPWS/TgAS deletion extent and
identifies a centromeric breakpoint
We used FISH with BAC probes flanking the mouse PWS/
AS-homologous domain in chromosome 7B/C (Fig.
1C,D) to define the centromeric and telomeric extent of
the TgPWS/TgAS deletion. To identify both chromosome
7 homologues in our FISH experiments using splenocytes
from TgAS mice or fibroblasts from TgPWS mice, we cohybridized BAC RP22-434N7 from the Tyr gene locus at
position 74.6 Mb (chromosome 7E1), which is intact in
TgPWS and TgAS mice (Fig. 2, and data not shown) [7].

At the centromeric end of the deletion, BAC RP24-354P8
spanning the Siglec-H-D7Mit70-Tubgcp5 region (43.3 Mb,
Fig. 1C) is deleted from one chromosome 7 in TgAS mice
(Fig. 2A). Additionally, BACs RP23-256L9 (p gene exons
10–24; 44 Mb) and RP23-195C6 (Herc2-Nipa1; 43.6 Mb)
are within the TgPWS/TgAS deletion (Fig. 1A, Fig. 2B, and
data not shown) as expected based on their map position.
In contrast, BAC RP24-426A19 from ~50 kb 3' of Luzp2
(42.9 Mb; Fig. 1C) shows a weak positive signal on one
chromosome 7 homologue in TgAS mice (Fig. 2C), suggesting a partial deletion and detection of the centromeric
breakpoint in TgAS mice.
At the telomeric end of the deletion, BAC RP23-266F22
(49.4 Mb; Fig. 1D) spanning four mouse PWS-region
imprinted genes, including Frat3, Mkrn3, Magel2 and Ndn,
was previously found to be deleted in TgPWS mice [13].
Extending telomeric from Frat3 towards Chrna7 (Fig. 1D),
BACs RP23-100P8, RP23-199N11 and RP23-140J4 were
all deleted in TgPWS mice (Fig. 2D, and data not shown).
In contrast, BACs RP23-5O6 from the Klf13 region (50.9
Mb; Fig. 1D, Fig. 2E) and RP24-215K5 from 5' Cezanne2
(Fig. 1D; data not shown) were intact in TgPWS/TgAS
mice. Two other BACs mapping more telomeric, RP2376F18 (Rlbp1 locus, 66.4 Mb) and RP23-441D12 (Il-16
locus, 70.8 Mb), were also intact in TgPWS mice (data not
shown). Intriguingly, BAC RP23-16A4 spanning Chrna7

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) maps the TgAS centromeric and telomeric deletion extent. In each
case, BAC RP22-434N7 from the chromosome 7 Tyrosinase (Tyr) locus (74.6 Mb; 44.0 cM) was hybridized as a control and is
shown as a red signal. All chromosome 7B/C BACs used as probes are shown as green signals while chromosomes are stained
with DAPI (blue). (A) BAC RP24-354P8 spanning the region including Siglec-H and Tubgcp5 shows a single-chromosome 7
signal indicating the deletion of this locus in TgAS splenocytes. (B) RP23-256L9 spans the p locus (exons 10–24) and is also
deleted in TgAS mice. (C) RP24-426A19 spans the region 3' of Luzp2 and detects a weak signal on one chromosome 7
homologue, suggesting partial deletion and detection of the centromeric breakpoint in the mutant mice. The two insets show
the images for individual probes. (D) RP23-199N11 covers part of the region between Frat3 and Chrna7 and is deleted in
TgAS mice. (E) RP23-506 for the Klf13 locus is intact in the deletion mice. (F) RP23-16A4 spans all 10 exons of Chrna7 and

(50.1 Mb; Fig. 1D) appears based on hybridization signal
intensity to be fully intact in TgPWS mice (Fig. 2F). Nevertheless, molecular data described below indicate that
about half of 16A4 is deleted in TgPWS/TgAS mice; it is
likely that these ostensibly contradictory data are
explained by the relative concentration of unique and
repetitive DNA sequences at the telomeric and centromeric ends of BAC 16A4 (5' and 3' ends of Chrna7, respectively) as well as the difficulty in quantifying FISH signals.
Microarray and QRT-PCR analyses further define the
TgPWS/TgAS deletion extent
Previous analysis of brain global gene expression in 5
TgPWS and 5 wildtype (WT) mice at P1 using a MGU74Av2 gene chip array (Affymetrix) which assayed
12,000 genes and ESTs, demonstrated that all 4 paternally-expressed mouse PWS-region imprinted genes
present on the array (Snurf-Snrpn, Ndn, Magel2 and
Mkrn3) have dramatically reduced expression [15]. Additionally, mRNA levels for non-imprinted genes Herc2 and

Cyfip1 were 50% in TgPWS compared with WT [15]. To
assess the extent of the TgPWS/TgAS deletion and the
potential effect of the transgene-insertion deletion on
expression of flanking genes, we used data mining from
several genome databases and analysis of several megabases of genome sequence to identify all genes in these
regions, determined which of these were on the MGU74Av2 gene chip, and then reanalyzed the brain microarray data from reference [15]. Although a 3–4 Mb "gene
desert" lies just proximal of Tubgcp5, we identified 9 genes
on the chip in the 9.1 Mb region centromeric of Tubgcp5,
a locus which FISH data above had shown was deleted, of
which four genes were not detectable in either TgPWS or
WT brain at P1 (Table 1). Five genes (Gas2, Hrmt1l3, E2F8,
Ptpn5, and Tsg101) were detectable and showed no
change in TgPWS compared to WT mouse brain (Table 1),
indicating that the TgPWS/TgAS deletion does not affect
any of these genes (Fig. 1A). Telomeric of Frat3, an

a The primary microarray data from this experiment were reported in reference 15. As summarized in Fig. 1A, reference 15 included the data for
the imprinted genes within the TgPWS/TgAS deletion that are on the MG-U74Av2 chip (Snrpn, Ndn, Magel2, Mkrn3 and Ube3a) and for nonimprinted genes within the deletion (Cyfip1, Herc2, and Gabrb3, although the latter transcript was not detectable; the p gene is also represented on
the chip although not detectable in TgPWS or WT mice, and not previously reported). Additionally, a cluster of chromosome 18B3 genes were
found to be abnormally expressed in TgPWS mice [15]. b mRNA levels are presented as the medians of Signal (relative abundance of a transcript),
for TgPWS (n = 5) and WT (n = 5), with the number of calls as "detected" out of 5 comparison experiments in parentheses.

Gene expression analyses for loci at or near the TgPWS/TgAS deletion breakpoints
Gene expression analyses for loci at or near the TgPWS/TgAS deletion breakpoints. (A) Tissue expression of
Siglec-H. RT-PCR using a cDNA mouse panel shows that Siglec-H (143-bp band) is strongly expressed in adult brain and
spleen, with moderate expression in lung and skeletal muscle tissues, but is low or absent in heart, liver, kidney and testis.
RNApolII (167-bp) gene expression was used as a control for both (A) and (B). (B) Developmental Siglec-H expression.
Very low or absent Siglec-H expression is detected by RT-PCR at E7-E15 with weak expression at late gestational stages (E17).
After birth, SiglecH expression is robustly detected in brain at P1 and P4. (C-F) Relative quantification of brain mRNA
levels for (C) Siglec-H, (D) Luzp2, (E) Cezanne2 and (F) Chrna7 was performed by QRT-PCR in two groups of 5
TgPWS (black bars) or 5 TgAS (gray bars) and 5 WT (white bars) mice at P1 and in 4 TgPWS or 4 TgAS and 4 WT mice at P4.
All values are presented as the means ± SE: * P ≤ 0.05; ** P ≤ 0.001; *** P ≤ 0.0001, significant differences between WT and
TgPWS or TgAS at the indicated time points (Independent samples t-test). (C) Siglec-H mRNA levels are decreased by ~2fold in TgPWS and TgAS compared with WT at P1 and P4. SiglecH mRNA levels in TgPWS vs. WT were 0.52 ± 0.04 vs. 1.29 ±
0.15 (P = 0.002) and 0.56 ± 0.12 vs. 1.31 ± 0.19 (P = 0.01) at P1 and P4, respectively. Siglec-H mRNA levels were 0.45 ± 0.03 in
TgAS compared with 1.18 ± 0.08 in WT at P1 (P = 0.0002) and 0.39 ± 0.04 compared with 0.92 ± 0.07 at P4 (P = 0.0008). (D)
Luzp2 mRNA levels in TgPWS vs. WT were 0.98 ± 0.02 vs. 1.25 ± 0.07 (P = 0.009) and 0.91 ± 0.02 vs. 1.11 ± 0.05 (P = 0.01) at
P1 and P4, respectively. In TgAS vs. WT mice, mRNA levels were 0.97 ± 0.07 vs. 1.06 ± 0.05 (P = 0.3) at P1 and 0.81 ± 0.05 vs.
0.98 ± 0.02 (P = 0.01) at P4. (E) Cezanne2 shows no difference in expression in TgPWS or TgAS and WT mice. At P1, mRNA
levels were 1.01 ± 0.03 for TgPWS vs. 1.04 ± 0.1 for WT (P = 0.8) and 1.03 ± 0.09 for TgAS vs. 1.06 ± 0.03 for WT (P = 0.7).
At P4, Cezanne2 mRNA levels were 0.92 ± 0.08 for TgPWS vs. 1.04 ± 0.03 for WT (P = 0.2) and 0.97 ± 0.23 for TgAS vs. 1.09
± 0.06 for WT (P = 0.6). (F) Chrna7 mRNA levels are ~0.6-fold in TgPWS and TgAS compared with WT mouse brain. At P1
the mRNA levels were 0.64 ± 0.04 in TgPWS vs. 0.99 ± 0.08 in WT (P = 0.005) and 0.57 ± 0.02 in TgAS vs. 0.89 ± 0.1 in WT (P
= 0.01), while at P4 mRNA levels for Chrna7 were 0.58 ± 0.01 for TgPWS vs. 1.05 ± 0.03 for WT (P < 0.0001) and 0.63 ± 0.04
for TgAS vs. 1.08 ± 0.12 for WT (P = 0.005).

Mapping of centromeric and telomeric TgPWS/TgAS deletion breakpoints and tissue specific up-regulation of
Chrna7. (A) Q-PCR for the Snurf-Snrpn promoter, NCCS1 and NCCS3 relative to Gapdh intron 1. The amount of
Snurf-Snrpn DNA was 1.01 ± 0.01 for the WT compared with 0.40 ± 0.05 for the TgPWS samples, P = 0.006. For NCCS1,
DNA fold was 0.98 ± 0.02 in WT vs. 1.12 ± 0.30 in TgPWS, P = 0.68. For NCCS3, DNA fold was 0.90 ± 0.09 in WT compared

Igf1r) of the fourteen genes extending out a further 5.6 Mb
and on the microarray were detectable and all had comparable levels in TgPWS and WT mice (Table 1). Therefore,
the Tg insertion-induced deletion does not affect gene
expression over large regions outside the boundaries of
the rearrangement.
We next assessed quantitative (Q) expression of genes that
map in the proximity of the known deleted loci at the centromeric [14,15] and telomeric [14] ends of the deletion
(Fig. 1A). At the centromeric end of the deletion, the
Siglec-H gene maps just proximal of Tubgcp5 and is predicted to have five exons (Fig. 1C), with the rare feature of
having the stop codon in the penultimate exon 4 [19].
Since there is no information regarding the pattern of
expression for Siglec-H [20,21], we first assessed this using
RT-PCR (Fig. 3A,B). In agreement with the general signaling function of Siglec genes in the haemopoietic, immune
and nervous systems [22], Siglec-H was predominantly
expressed in brain and spleen (Fig. 3A). Less robust
expression was seen in lung and skeletal muscle, while
there was little or no amplification in heart, liver, kidney
and testis (Fig. 3A). A postnatal role for Siglec-H expression was suggested by the lack of amplification at early
embryonic stages with increased expression after birth
(Fig. 3B), as also found for ESTs in Unigene (data not
shown).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/157

suggesting that the deletion breakpoint might lie in the
vicinity of this gene. Chrna7 is orientated with a telomeric
5' end (Fig. 1D). Using QRT-PCR for Chrna7 and primers
spanning exon 2 to exon 3, we found ~1.7-fold decreased
Chrna7 mRNA levels in both TgPWS and TgAS brain at P1
and P4 (P < 0.05) (Fig. 3F). Since the 5' end of Chrna7 is
not deleted in the TgPWS/TgAS mouse model (see below,
which is also consistent with the normal FISH signal for
BAC RP23-16A4 reported above), the finding of ~60%
total mRNA levels suggests that only ~20% of the usual
level of Chrna7 mRNA transcripts are generated from the
deleted chromosome in TgPWS and TgAS mouse brain.
The 80% reduction in expression in cis suggests that the
deletion removes essential regulatory sequences (see Discussion).

By QRT-PCR, Siglec-H showed 2-fold decreased mRNA
levels in the brain of both TgPWS and TgAS mouse models
at P1 and P4 (P < 0.01; Fig. 3C), indicating that this gene
appears to be within the TgPWS/TgAS deletion (Fig. 1A).
It may also be noted that the 0.5-fold expression level in
TgPWS and TgAS mice compared with WT indicates that
Siglec-H is not an imprinted gene. The next gene centromeric of this, Luzp2, showed ~0.8-fold decreased mRNA
levels in TgPWS brain at P1 and P4 and in TgAS brain at
P4 (P < 0.05) (Fig. 3D). At P1 in TgAS, Luzp2 brain mRNA
levels were decreased to 0.91-fold vs. WT (P = 0.3). Combined, the presence of the TgPWS/TgAS deletion resulted
in a Luzp2 mRNA level in neonatal brain that is significantly (0.83-fold, P = 0.0002) less than in WT. We conclude that the Luzp2 gene is intact at the centromeric end
of the TgPWS/TgAS deletion but suggest a model in which
a neuronal regulatory element is deleted that accounts for
~33% of Luzp2 expression from the deleted allele (see Discussion for a description of this and alternative models).

Fine-mapping of the centromeric TgPWS/TgAS deletion
breakpoint
The gene expression data described above suggest that
Siglec-H is deleted in TgPWS and TgAS mice while Luzp2 is
intact but shows slightly yet significantly reduced expression levels. In order to further delineate the centromeric
breakpoint of the deletion and a potential mechanism for
the ~33% reduction in Luzp2 expression from the deletion
allele, we examined the genome sequence of BAC RP24426A19 that lies between Siglec-H and Luzp2 (Fig. 1C) and
that was identified above by FISH as partially deleted in
TgPWS/TgAS mice. There are no exons for any gene
encoded in this BAC. Nevertheless, using BLAST of
RepeatMasked RP24-426A19 DNA sequence against the
non-redundant GenBank database, extending from the
centromeric end of BAC RP24-426A19 we identified five
non-coding conserved sequences (NCCS1-5) at positions
~30.1, 39.9, 68.8, 107.3, and 134.5 kb, respectively (Fig.
1C). NCCS1-5 are 250-bp, 68-bp, 188-bp, 104-bp, and
157-bp in length and show 82%, 91%, 81%, 82% and
83% identity with human, respectively. As in mouse, the
five NCCS elements in human are located adjacent to
LUZP2 and map in chromosome 11p14.3 (Fig. 1B). All
five NCCS elements are likely to be involved in the regulation of LUZP2, while other flanking genes are unlikely
to be regulated by or to relate to NCCS1-5, as the next
most centromeric gene (Gas2) maps 3.2 Mb from Luzp2
while the genes more telomeric are either non-syntenic in
human (Fig. 1B), mapping to human chromosome 15q,
or represent a rodent-specific acquisition (Siglec-H; see
Discussion).

At the telomeric end of the deletion, expression of
Cezanne2, which maps just centromeric of Klf13 (Fig. 1D),
was unchanged by QRT-PCR in TgPWS and TgAS brain
compared with WT mice (Fig. 3E), and thus this gene is
intact in the TgPWS/TgAS deletion mouse model. The
only remaining gene between Cezanne2 (intact in TgPWS/
TgAS mice) and Frat3 (deleted [13]) is Chrna7 (Fig. 1D),

PCR primers were designed from four of the NCCS elements and Q-PCR of DNA from TgPWS and WT mice was
used to examine the relative amount of each NCCS with
respect to intron 1 of Gapdh, which is intact in all mice
studied. As a deletion control, we similarly examined by
Q-PCR the Snurf-Snrpn promoter, which as expected
showed a 0.4 to 0.44-fold relative level in TgPWS vs. WT

mice (Fig. 4A,4B). Whereas there was no difference
between TgPWS and WT mice for NCCS1 and NCCS3
(Fig. 4A), indicating that NCCS1, NCCS2 and NCCS3 are
intact in TgPWS mice, Q-PCR for NCCS4 and NCCS5
identified 1.8-fold and 2.1-fold lower levels for TgPWS vs.
WT, respectively (Fig. 4B), indicating that these are
deleted from one allele in TgPWS mice. Therefore, the centromeric breakpoint of the TgPWS/TgAS ~5 Mb deletion
lies in the 38.5 kb region between NCCS3 and NCCS4.
Up-regulation of Chrna7 allows mapping the telomeric
TgPWS/TgAS deletion breakpoint
In contrast to the results shown above for Chrna7 expression in brain, regular RT-PCR for Chrna7 in newborn liver
showed a dramatic increased expression in TgPWS and
TgAS compared with WT (Fig. 4C). Indeed, quantification
of liver Chrna7 expression by QRT-PCR revealed ~15-fold
increased mRNA levels in TgPWS mice (P = 0.002) (Fig.
4D). A similar up-regulation of Chrna7 expression was
found by RT-PCR in spleen tissues of TgAS mice (Fig. 4E).
However, EµLMP2A control mice with B-cell lineage
expression of LMP2A showed normal expression of
Chrna7 in newborn liver (Fig. 4F). Combined, these data
on two different LMP2A transgene models indicates that
LMP2A expression in B cells does not upregulate Chrna7
in trans, and suggests that the increased expression of
Chrna7 observed in liver and spleen from TgPWS and
TgAS mice results from a cis effect of the transgene inser-

tion. Since B-cell transcription of the LMP2A transgene in
these models is driven from an immunoglobulin heavy
chain gene promoter and enhancer [7,16], we hypothesized that the latter enhancer was also driving transcription of the heterologous, endogenous Chrna7 promoter.
To test this hypothesis, we used an exon 2 forward primer
for Chrna7 and a reverse primer (OL-105) from inside the
Tg (Fig. 5A) to perform RT-PCR on cDNA from TgPWS vs.
WT brain, which detected a 1.1 kb product specifically in
TgPWS samples (Fig. 4G). The 1.1 kb band was cloned
and sequenced, identifying it as a fusion transcript encoding Chrna7 exons 2–4 fused to the sense strand of the
LMP2A transgene (Fig. 4H). The latter result indicates that
at least the telomeric copy of the Tg array is orientated in
a 5'-3' telomere to centromere fashion. Furthermore, we
can conclude that the 5' end of the Chrna7 locus is intact
and correctly splices through exon 4 but then splices into
the LMP2A transgene. These data strongly suggest that the
telomeric breakpoint of the TgPWS/TgAS ~5 Mb deletion
is in the 38.1 kb Chrna7 intron 4.
Orientation of the LMP2A transgene array
To fully understand how the transgene array might affect
flanking gene expression, it is necessary to define the
integrity of the array and the orientation of each transgene
copy and to flanking genes. To characterize the transgene
array, we amplified genomic DNA from TgPWS mice and

WT controls using primers from within the transgene (Fig.
5A). Amplification with either single primer (RN1316 or
RN1317) did not lead to any product (Fig. 5C,D), indicating that there are no head-to-head or tail-to-tail copies of
adjacent transgene inserts. In contrast, PCR using primers
from adjacent copies of the transgene results in amplification of the LMP2A array in TgPWS DNA (Fig. 5B). These
data indicate that the ~80 copies of the transgene [7] are
all in the same tail-to-head orientation. Combined with
the data described above on the sense strand fusion of
Chrna7 and LMP2A cDNA sequences, we conclude that
the entire Tg array is orientated in a 5'-3' manner from the
telomeric to centromeric end.

expression levels due to hemizygosity at the centromeric
end of the deletion is unlikely to have a phenotypic effect.
Likewise, the ~17% reduction in overall expression of
Luzp2 observed in brain of TgPWS/TgAS mice is unlikely
to be functionally important, since complete loss of Luzp2
does not lead to any specific phenotype [25]. Although
Chrna7 is another gene partially deleted in TgPWS/TgAS
mice and the human ortholog maps in 15q13, the latter is
outside the PWS/AS deletions and the TgPWS/TgAS phenotype is unlikely to be affected by Chrna7 hemizygosity,
since Chrna7 heterozygous knockout mice show no
abnormal phenotypes and even Chrna7-/- null mice have
only mild skin and reproductive phenotypes [26-29].

Discussion

Implications for evolutionary acquisition of new genes and
breakpoint mechanisms
Our study also characterized expression of a recently identified gene, Siglec-H, which belongs to the Siglec gene family encoding immunoglobulin-like lectins that act as
extracellular receptors for sialic acid residues of glycan
chains [20,21]. The majority of Siglec genes map in a single CD33 (Siglec-3)-related cluster in human 19q13 and
the syntenic mouse chromosome 7B2 region [20,21]. In
contrast, we show here that Siglec-H, which is rodent-specific and has no primate ortholog [21], lies adjacent to the
mouse PWS/AS-homologous region at a position 12.3 Mb
from its ancestral location. It seems likely that Siglec-H
has similar postnatal immunological functions as other
Siglecs, given its robust expression in spleen. However, in
contrast with the restricted expression of most other Siglec
genes to the haematopoietic and immune systems, SiglecH is also transcribed at high levels in postnatal brain.
Although conjectural, it is tempting to speculate that neuronal expression of Siglec-H may have arisen due to an
evolutionary positioning adjacent to single (Luzp2) [25]
or clustered (ie., Tubgcp5, Cyfip1, Nipa2, Nipa1) [14] genes
expressed at high levels in the nervous system, such that
Siglec-H transcription may be under control of a neuronal
enhancer for one or more of these genes.

A mouse model of PWS/AS class I deletions
The TgPWS and TgAS mouse models were created by
insertion of an LMP2A transgene array of ~80 copies [7]
that fortuitously generated a deletion equivalent to those
that occur in PWS and AS in the human. Although the
mouse deletion was previously estimated as being ~5 Mb
in length, genome sequence analysis indicates that the
deleted segment could be as large as 6.8 Mb (Siglec-H to
Chrna7 distance). However, there are a few gaps in the
sequence, particularly in several duplicated genomic
regions throughout the imprinted domain, and so the
exact size of this interval remains unknown. Nevertheless,
our previous [7,13-15] and present studies allow the conclusion that 13 imprinted and 11 non-imprinted genes are
included within the mouse PWS/AS-deletion region (see
Fig. 1A). In addition to spanning all the PWS- and AShomologous paternally and maternally expressed genes,
respectively, the TgPWS/TgAS deletion in mice also
includes the homologs of typically deleted non-imprinted
genes (ie., Gabrb3, Gabra5, Gabrg3, p/Oca2, and Herc2) as
well as those of the PWS/AS genes (Nipa1, Nipa2, Cyfip1
and Tubgcp5) that define the deletion as equivalent to
human class I deletions [1,4]. Although the classic PWS or
AS clinical phenotype is similar in both class I and class II
deletions, respectively, a more severe neurobehavioral
phenotype has been described for class I compared with
class II deletion patients as well as for deletion vs. UPD
patients in each syndrome [23,24]. The TgPWS and TgAS
deletion mouse models may therefore prove useful to
compare the neurobehavioral phenotype to the UPD or
ID PWS [5,6] or Ube3a gene mutation AS [11,12] mouse
models.

Although the TgPWS/TgAS mouse models show reduced
expression of several other genes, including Siglec-H,
Luzp2 and Chrna7, as compared to the human PWS and
AS class I deletions, none of these additional genes are
likely to contribute to the TgPWS and TgAS phenotypes.
For example, since Siglec-H is a recent evolutionary addition in the rodent genome [20], its 50% reduction in

Intriguingly, both the centromeric and telomeric TgPWS/
TgAS deletion breakpoints map at or close to the positions
of chromosomal evolutionary breakpoints, and at each of
the latter two positions there are also rodent-specific gene
duplication-insertions. At the centromeric end, the
TgPWS/TgAS deletion breakpoint lies immediately adjacent to Siglec-H, which as discussed above arose in rodents
by a genomic duplication from a precursor gene located
~12 Mb away. The evolutionary insertion of Siglec-H
between Tubgcp5 and Luzp2 occurs right at the boundary
of synteny with human chromosome 15q11.2-q13 and
11p14.3-p15.1, respectively (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the
TUBGCP5 ortholog also lies within a few kilobases of a
primate evolutionary breakpoint that translocated the

ter to 15q11.2 from an ancestral 15q13 location [14].
Although the telomeric TgPWS/TgAS deletion breakpoint
within Chrna7 is not right at an evolutionary breakpoint,
this gene also lies adjacent to an evolutionary breakpoint
separating genes whose human orthologs map to the PWS
imprinted domain in 15q11.2 and a point 8.7 Mb away in
15q13.3 (Fig. 1B). At this position also, there are speciesspecific duplications in mouse and human, with the retrotransposed Frat3 limited to rodents [13] or the HERC2and flanking duplicons in primates [5,14]. Other authors
have also noted the apparent congruity of chromosome
rearrangement and evolutionary breakpoints [14,30-32],
suggesting that currently unknown chromosomal structural features in these regions may play recombinogenic
roles.
Effect of the transgene or deletion on gene expression:
mapping of putative neuronal enhancers
Transgene insertions may be accompanied by other chromosomal rearrangements such as deletions (this paper;
[33]), duplications [34], inversions [35], translocations
[36], or combinations of rearrangements [36,37]. These
events can induce alterations of gene expression over large
chromosomal regions [33], or the transgene itself can do
so [38]. Extensive analysis of genes flanking the TgPWS/
TgAS transgene insertion demonstrated no other rearrangements other than the PWS/AS-region deletion and
that gene expression over large regions outside the immediate flanking genes was not affected. In contrast, expression from the first gene promoter outside either end of the
transgene insertion-deletion was affected. For example,
the 5' promoter and 3' end of Luzp2 are ~600 kb and 110–
140 kb centromeric to the LMP2A transgene array-deletion breakpoint, respectively, and this gene shows a significantly reduced expression in TgPWS and TgAS mice.
Although at present we cannot fully exclude three models
that might lower the Luzp2 transcriptional level in cis in
brain, which invoke either (i) a non-specific disruption of
chromatin, (ii) a weak silencing effect from the transgene
tandem array [45], or (iii) extended antisense transcripts
from the transgene array given that the 5'-3' orientation of
the LMP2A array is opposite to the Luzp2 direction of transcription, we feel that these are less likely than a fourth
model that has additional experimental support. We propose that the 33% reduction in expression of Luzp2 from
the deletion allele is most likely explained by deletion of
a neuronal enhancer (Fig. 6A). Consistent with this
model, we identified two NCCS elements (NCCS4 and
NCCS5) conserved in all eutherian mammals sequenced
to date and deleted in TgPWS and TgAS mice, that represent strong candidates to be the neuronal enhancer. As
noted above, these elements map to the homologous
chromosome location in human but are almost 4 Mb
from the next most centromeric gene (Gas2) while other
flanking genes in mouse are non-syntenic (Tubgcp5) or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/157

not present (Siglec-H) in human (Fig. 1B). Numerous
NCCSs occur within mammalian genomes [39,40], and
while the majority of these have no known function,
many do act as enhancer elements [41-43]. Future in vitro
and in vivo studies [44] will be able to examine this
enhancer model for Luzp2.
At the telomeric end of the deletion, expression of Chrna7
was dramatically upregulated in liver and spleen, but not
brain, due to a tissue-specific positional effect of the transgene. We propose that the transgene immunogobulin Mu
enhancer acts in B cells to promote transcription in cis
from the heterologous Chrna7 promoter (Fig. 6B). Similarly, transgene regulatory elements 1 Mb away have been
shown to activate Sox9 [38]. Moreover, our data combined with cloning of a 5'-Chrna7-LMP2A fusion transcript clearly demonstrates that the Chrna7 promoter is
intact and fully capable of high levels of enhancer driven
activity on the deletion allele in TgPWS/TgAS mice.
Perhaps the most intriguing finding of this study was our
serendipitous discovery that a putative neuronal enhancer
for the Chrna7 gene maps within the telomeric end of the
TgPWS and TgAS deletion. In TgPWS and TgAS mice, the
Chrna7 mRNA level in brain from the deletion chromosome 7 falls to 20% of normal levels despite the fact that
the 5' promoter is not deleted. Non-enhancer models
appear unlikely to explain this data: for example, models
invoking (i) non-specific disruption of chromatin or (ii) a
silencing effect from the transgene tandem array [45] are
unlikely to account for the specific ~80% reduction in cis
expression levels in TgPWS and TgAS mouse brain, while
allowing a dramatic activation of the same promoter in
immune tissues, and, finally (iii) Chrna7 is transcribed
from upstream and in the same orientation as the transgene array, so that an antisense mechanism is not valid.
Therefore, we propose that sequences that map 3' of the
deletion breakpoint in Chrna7 intron 4 are critical for
Chrna7 expression in neurons (Fig. 6C), and it is the deletion of this putative neuronal enhancer that accounts for
the reduced Chrna7 expression in brain of TgPWS and
TgAS mice (Fig. 6D). Similar analyses of Chrna7 gene
expression in other tissues of TgPWS and TgAS mice, such
as the neuromuscular junction, heart, and skin, will allow
further assessment of the tissue specificity of the proposed
enhancer. Interestingly, our data in brain and other tissues
also imply that the Chrna7 promoter in vivo only has basal
transcriptional activity whereas for high levels of transcription, Chrna7 requires activation by a tissue-specific
enhancer(s). In support of this model, we recently identified as candidate enhancer elements two NCCSs within
Chrna7 intron 4, whereas no other conserved non-coding
sequences other than the minimal promoter occur in a
412 kb domain starting 18 kb 5' of Chrna7 and extending
3' of the gene towards the mouse PWS-region imprinted

domain (R.D.N., K.C., and M.S., unpublished data). We
are currently mapping the Chrna7 NCCS elements against
the TgPWS/TgAS deletion endpoints, while in vitro and in
vivo approaches will be needed for analysis of function as
candidate neuronal transcriptional enhancers and/or for
other cell types.

Conclusion
In this study, we used a variety of molecular cytological
and genetic technologies to map the transgene insertionchromosome deletion breakpoints of a mouse model of
PWS and AS to ~38 kb regions between the Luzp2 and
Siglec-H genes at the centromeric end and within Chrna7
intron 4 at the telomeric end, respectively. Gene expression analyses then allowed us to demonstrate that genes
extending out a further 9.1- or 5.6-Mb centromeric or telomeric of the deletion, respectively, are not affected by
either the deletion or insertion of the transgene tandem
array. In contrast, transcription of genes at (Chrna7) or
flanking (Luzp2) the transgene insertion-deletion breakpoints are affected by the disruption of normal chromosome architecture, with positional effects leading to up- or
down-regulation dependent on the tissue-specificity and
locations of enhancers within the transgene or putatively
removed by the TgPWS/TgAS chromosome deletion.
Using Luzp2 as an example, we demonstrate that analysis
of phylogenetically conserved sequences and consideration of synteny allows the fine mapping of a putative neuronal enhancer element(s), while a similar model likely
also applies for Chrna7. In human, CHRNA7 is of significant interest as a schizophrenia candidate gene with both
genetic and functional support [46-48]. Nevertheless, the
molecular basis of its candidacy remains uncertain since
rare coding and in vitro characterized promoter variants in
CHRNA7 [49,50] may be insufficient to account for deficient function in vivo [51], particularly in light of our
observations that expression of Chrna7 in vivo requires a
major participation of enhancer function. Identification
of a neuronal enhancer and further studies in the human
to examine for genetic variation and potential mutations
might provide an explanation for a role of CHRNA7 as a
schizophrenia-susceptibility gene.

Methods
Animals
We used three mouse models all of which have an LMP2A
transgene insertion. In the TgPWS and TgAS models, the
insertion of an LMP2A transgene array replaced the PWS/
AS-homologous region in chromosome 7B/C [7,9,15]
while the EµLMP2A mice have B-cell lineage expression of
LMP2A [16]. WT littermates were used as controls in each
experiment. The University of Pennsylvania Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal
experiments. All animals were bred and genotyped as
described [7,16].

BAC contig assembly and fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) studies
Splenocytes from TgAS mice were cultured for 48 hr in the
presence of concanavalin A for stimulation of cell proliferation. After harvesting, cells were treated with hypotonic
buffer (0.075 M KCl) for 15 min, chromosomes were
fixed with methanol-acetic acid (3:1) and spread onto
slides [17]. For some probes, fibroblast cell lines from
TgPWS mice were used. BAC DNA was labeled with biotin
or digoxigenin and hybridized as previously described
[18]. Image acquisition was performed using fluorescence
microscopy, acquiring grayscale images using separate filters for each fluorophore followed by digital merging and
pseudocoloring. BAC RP22-434N7, spanning the mouse
chromosome 7 tyrosinase gene, was used as a control
probe to identify both chromosome 7 homologues.

The chromosome 7B/C BAC contigs were generated by
standard bioinformatics analyses using Ensembl [52] and
BLAST [53]. The position and overlap of each BAC clone
was determined by BLAST using gene cDNA/EST
sequences, BAC end sequences, and STS sequences. Previously described BACs are RP23-266F22 [13], RP23256L9, RP23-195C6, RP24-396N13 and RP24-354P8
[14]. It may be noted that we previously incorrectly
assumed the position of Trpm1 (formerly Mlsn1) [7],
whereas analysis of genomic sequence data now clearly
place this locus telomeric to the TgPWS/TgAS deletion
(see Fig. 1A).
Gene expression analyses
Microarray analysis
Brain global gene expression was assessed in five TgPWS
and five WT male CD-1 sibs at P1 using the Affymetrix
Murine Genome (MG) U74Av2 Array. The microarray
experiments and data processing, with identification of
genes significantly altered in TgPWS brain, were performed previously (see also Table 1) [15]. In the present
study, we reanalyzed the microarray data for genes identified from bioinformatics analyses (see above) as mapping
adjacent to the TgPWS/TgAS deletion.
QRT-PCR
Brain tissues from four or five each of TgPWS, TgAS and
littermate WT mice at P1 and P4 were used for most QRTPCR experiments. Liver Chrna7 expression was determined in four TgPWS and four WT mice at P1. QRT-PCR
analysis was performed as described [15]. Briefly, total
RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and reversetranscribed using Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). For all reactions, each sample was
loaded in triplicate and SYBR green was used as the fluorescent dye. Gapdh was used as an internal control. Relative quantification of gene expression was carried out
using a PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied

Biosystems Inc.) and data was processed using a comparative CT method [15]. A t-test for independent samples
(Analyze-it) was used to generate two-tailed P statistics for
each experiment. PCR primers were: Cezanne2 (exons 11–
12): RN2262: 5'-TGATTCACAAGCTCCCCTAGCT-3' (F),
RN2263:
5'-GGAGTGGACCTGGGTTCATCT-3'
(R);
Chrna7 (exons 2–3): RN2357: 5'-GCCGCTCACCGTGTACTTCT-3' (F), RN2358: 5'-GGTGGTTAAAACTTGGTTCTTCTCA-3' (R); Luzp2 (exons 7–8): RN2264: 5'AAATCCAAGCCCAGCTGAAA-3' (F), RN2265: 5'-TGTTGGGCCTTAAATAACAAATCTT-3' (R); and Siglec-H (exons
1–2): RN2464: 5'-AGGATCTCTGTGCATGTGACAGA-3'
(F), RN2465: 5'-AGGACGACCAAGCTCCAGTGT-3' (R).
Regular RT-PCR
Liver expression of Chrna7 was assessed in 2 TgPWS, 2
TgAS and 2 EµLMP2A mice and WT littermates at P1. In
addition, Chrna7 expression in spleen was determined in
2 TgAS vs. 2 WT mice at P1. Extraction and reverse transcription of total RNA was performed as for QRT-PCR
experiments. Chrna7 primers (exons 1–3) were: RN2368:
5'-GGAGGCATCTGGCTGGCTCTG-3' (F), and RN2358
(R; see above). Siglec-H expression was performed using a
Mouse Multiple Tissue cDNA Panel I (BD Bioscience
Clontech) as well as WT brain at P1 and P4. Siglec-H primers (exons 1–2) were RN2511: 5'-GTGACAACGGTTCTTACT-3' (F) and RN2465 (R). For each gene analysis,
RNApolII expression was used as a control: RN2318: 5'ACTCCTTCACTCACTGTCTTCCTGTT-3' (F), RN2319: 5'TCCTGATCTTCTGCCACCACTGT-3'(R). PCR conditions
for Chrna7, Siglec-H, and RNApolII were initial denaturation at 94°C, 10 min, followed by 32 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing at 55°C, 30 sec, and
extension at 72°C, 30 sec, with a final extension at 72°C,
10 min, using Gold Taq DNA polymerase (ABI).
NCCS analysis at the centromeric TgPWS/TgAS deletion
breakpoint
We identified non-coding conserved sequences (NCCS)
by taking BAC genomic sequence, masking repetitive
sequences with RepeatMasker [54], then using BLAST
analysis of the non-redundant (NR) and whole genome
shotgun (wgs) databases. From BAC RP24-426A19, we
identified five NCCS elements (see Results), and PCR
primers for NCCS1, NCCS3, NCCS4 and NCCS5 were
designed and used to quantify the DNA amount in WT
and TgPWS mice by Q-PCR. Brain and liver DNA were
extracted using a phenol-chloroform method. 500 ng of
each DNA sample was used for Q-PCR and SYBR green
was used as the fluorescent dye, with each Q-PCR reaction
performed in triplicate. As an internal control for comparison of test DNA sequence, we used PCR for Gapdh intron
1: RN2518: 5'-GGCCGCCGCCATGT-3' (F) and RN2519:
5'-GGAAGGCCTAAGCAAGATTTCA-3' (R). In addition,
primers from the Snurf-Snrpn promoter were used as a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/157

positive control for the deletion status in TgPWS DNA:
RN2142: 5'-GCAAAAATGTGCGCATGTG-3' (F) and
RN2143: 5'-CTCTCCTCTCTGCGCTAGTCTTG-3' (R). The
CT method was used to process the data [15] and all the
samples were normalized to the same WT sample. Primers
for
NCCS1
were:
RN2515:
5'-AAATCATGAGCCAAGCCAAAA-3' (F) and RN2516: 5'-TGGCTTCCCTTATCACTTTCACA-3' (R); for NCCS3: RN2513: 5'TTGGAACATGCAGAACAATGAAT-3' (F) and RN2514: 5'AGGCTGCCAACCTGCAAA-3' (R); for NCCS4: RN2522:
5'-GCCACTAAATTGGATCCTTAGACATAT-3' (F) and
RN2523: 5'-AAACCTGTTCCTACCCATGATAATCT-3' (R);
and for NCCS5: RN2524: 5'-TCTCCCCCTAGGTCTTCTGTTTAA-3' (F) and RN2525: 5'-TGGCCAGTGATC ATGTACAGATC-3' (R).
Fine mapping of the telomeric TgPWS/TgAS deletion
breakpoint
To fine map the telomeric TgPWS/TgAS breakpoint, total
RNA from TgPWS brain tissue was reverse-transcribed
using the Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) with a reverse primer from inside the transgene
(Fig. 5A): OL-105: 5'-CGTGTGGCTTAC CTGCTGCCAATG-3'. cDNA was amplified by PCR using the
RN2357 forward primer for Chrna7 (exon 2) and OL-105.
The amplification conditions were initial denaturation at
94°C for 10 min, followed by 37 cycles of denaturation at
94°C for 4 min, annealing at 61°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 6 min, with a final extension at 72°C for
10 min, using Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1-TA vector using a TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and
sequenced using standard techniques (University of Pennsylvania DNA sequencing Core facility).
Orientation of the LMP2A transgene
To determine the orientation of the LMP2A transgene
array, three types of PCR amplifications were performed,
first using forward and reverse primers located at the 3'
and 5' ends of the transgene sequence, respectively (Fig.
5A): RN1316: 5'-GTTGTTTCCGCCATCGTACC-3' (R) and
RN1317: 5'-TATGAGCTACTCTCTGACCC-3' (R). The
other two reactions were performed using either forward
or reverse primers alone. The amplification conditions
were 95°C for 10 min followed by 32 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 sec, annealing at 59°C for 30 sec, and
extension at 72°C for 30 sec, with a final extension at
72°C for 10 min, using Platinum Taq Gold polymerase
(ABI).
