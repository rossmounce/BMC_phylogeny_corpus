Abstract
Background: Although ethnomedically and taxonomically guided searches for new medicinal
plants can improve the percentage of plants found containing active compounds when compared
to random sampling, ethnobotany has fulfilled little of its promise in the last few decades to deliver
a bounty of new, laboratory-proven medicinal plants and compounds. It is quite difficult to test,
isolate, and elucidate the structure and mechanism of compounds from the plethora of new
medicinal plant uses described each year with limited laboratory time and resources and the high
cost of clinical trials of new drug candidates.
Methods: A new quantitative theoretical framework of mathematical formulas called "relational
efficacy" is proposed that should narrow down this search for new plant-derived medicines based
on the hypothesis that closely related plants used to treat closely related diseases in distantly
related cultures have a higher probability of being effective because they are more likely to be
independent discoveries of similar plant compounds and disease mechanisms. A prerequisite to this
hypothesis, the idea that empirical testing in traditional medicine will lead to choosing similar
medicinal plants and therefore the medicinal flora of two distant cultures will prove to be more
similar than their general flora, is tested using resampling statistics on cross-cultural field data of
the plants used by the Malinké of Mali and the Asháninka of Peru to treat the diseases malaria,
African sleeping sickness, Chagas' disease, leishmaniasis, diabetes, eczema, asthma, and uterine
fibroids.
Results: In this case, the similarity of the medicinal floras is found to be significantly greater than
the similarity of the general floras, but only when the diseases in question are grouped into the
categories of parasitic and autoimmune diseases.
Conclusion: If the central theoretical framework of this hypothesis is shown to be true, it will
allow the synthesis of medicinal plant information from around the world to pinpoint the species
with the highest potential efficacy to take into the laboratory and analyze further, ultimately saving
much field and laboratory time and resources.

en plantas, en comparación con las búsquedas aleatorias. A pesar de lo anterior, en las últimas
décadas, la etnobotánica no ha cumplido con las expectativas de proveer numerosas plantas
medicinales y químicos nuevos una vez examinados en el laboratorio. Cada año se describen una
plétora de plantas medicinales y sus usos, sin embargo las limitaciones de tiempo y recursos en los
laboratorios, unidos al alto coste de los ensayos clínicos de las drogas potenciales, hacen muy difícil
probar, aislar, y elucidar la estructura y el mecanismo de los compuestos de estas plantas. Se
propone un nuevo marco teórico cuantitativo cuyo fin es focalizar la búsqueda de nueva plantas
medicinales. Este marco teórico está basado en la hipótesis que las plantas cercanamente
relacionadas, usadas para tratar enfermedades cercanamente relacionadas en culturas
distantemente relacionadas, tienen una eficacia potencial más alta, debido a que es más probable
que estos hallazgos sean descubrimientos independientes de compuestos químicos similares. Parte
de esta hipótesis, que las escogencias racionales se hacen para elegir plantas medicinales similares
y que la flora medicinal de dos culturas distantes es más similar que su flora general, se probó
usando métodos estadísticos de remuestreo con datos de campo de la comunidad Malinké de Malí
y de la Asháninka de Perú, y las enfermedades de paludismo, enfermedad africana del sueño,
enfermedad de Chagas, leishmania, diabetes, eczema, asma, y fibromas uterinos. Se encontró, en
este caso, que la similitud de las floras medicinales es significativamente mayor a la similitud de las
floras generales, solamente cuando las enfermedades analizadas se agruparon en las categorías de
enfermedades parasitarias y enfermedades autoinmunes. Si se demostrara que las otras partes de
esta hipótesis son ciertas, se podría sintetizar la información sobre plantas medicinales alrededor
del mundo, para establecer así las plantas potencialmente más eficaces para llevarlas al laboratorio
y analizarlas más profundamente.

Par rapport aux recherches menées de façon aléatoire, les recherches effectuées par des critères
ethnobotaniques et taxonomiques ont de meilleures chances à découvrir de nouvelles plantes
médicinales à produit chimique actifs. Pendant les dernières décennies pourtant, l'ethnobotanique
a réalisé peu de ces promesses à révéler un grand nombre de plantes médicinales et de nouveaux
produits chimiques, testés au laboratoire. Avec les ressources limitées pour la recherche au
laboratoire et le coût élevé des épreuves cliniques pour trouver de nouveaux candidats aux
médicaments, il est difficile d'étudier, d'isoler et d'élucider la structure et le mécanisme des produits
chimiques de chacune des nombreuses plantes médicinales (et les utilisations de ces plantes)
décrites chaque année. Nous proposons une nouvelle technique théorique et quantitative pour
préciser la recherche de nouvelles plantes médicinales; elle est basée sur l'hypothèse que les plantes
étroitement apparentées, employées pour traiter les maladies étroitement apparentées dans les
cultures très éloignées les unes des autres, ont une potentialité d'efficacité supérieure parce qu'elles
représentent la découverte indépendante des propriétés chimiques semblables des plantes. Une
partie de cette hypothèse-qui démontre que la sélection des plantes médicinales semblables est un
choix rationnel et qu'il y a davantage de ressemblance dans la flore médicinale de deux cultures
éloignées que dans leur flore générale-est examinée par un re-échantillonnage des données de
recherches effectuées parmi les Malinké au Mali et les Asháninka au Pérou, en particulier sur la
malaria, la maladie africaine du sommeil, la maladie de Chagas, la leishmania, le diabète, l'eczéma,
l'asthme et les fibromes utérins. Dans ces cas précis, la similitude de la flore médicinale s'avère
sensiblement plus grande que la similitude de la flore générale, mais seulement quand les maladies
en question sont regroupées ensemble comme maladies parasitaires et auto-immunitaires. Si cette
hypothèse est prouvée, elle permettra la synthèse des informations recueillies sur les plantes
médicinales du monde entier pour en sélectionner de façon plus précise celles qui sont les plus
efficaces et qui méritent analyse plus approfondie au laboratoire.

Introduction
The field of ethnobotany is moving towards hypothesisdriven analytical research in recent years and away from
simple inventories and descriptive work [1]. As part of this
movement, quantitative ethnobotany is an increasingly
useful field that is necessary both for analyzing the huge
(and growing) amounts of plant use data being generated
[2-5] and for improving the rigor and validity of ethnobotany as a science [6]. In general terms, Lewis et al. [7]
have declared the success of ethnomedically-directed
searches for new medicines from plants, stating a figure of
30% of the plant species collected using anti-infective ethnobotanical leads are found to have anti-HIV in in vitro
tests (the hit rate), vs. only 8.5% for "random" screenings
where every plant seen is collected for testing. The hit rate
went up to 71.4% when plants used traditionally as antivirals were tested vs. the more general anti-infective category. They state the need for more of this type of research,
including the search for more antimalarial plant compounds. The recent success with finding the anti-HIV drug
prostratin in a Samoan medicinal plant Homalanthus
nutans (G. Forst.) Guill. [Euphorbiaceae] [8] and the antidiarrheal compound crofelemer from the Western Amazonian plant Croton lechleri Müll. Arg. [Euphorbiaceae] [9]
shows that there is hope for finding new medicines for
epidemic diseases via ethnobotany while upholding
indigenous intellectual property rights. McClatchey [10],
however, explains that despite successes like prostratin
modern bioprospecting from ethnomedical sources has
largely failed and calls for better methods of analyzing
and sharing of traditional medicinal plant knowledge.
The goal of the "relational efficacy" quantitative technique describe here is to raise the hit rate above even the
30% seen with ethnobotanically-directed medicinal plant
searches, i.e., to increase the efficiency of these searches.
Several promising techniques and conclusions have
already arisen from quantitative ethnobotany: targeting
medicinal plants for drug development that are in families
with above average ratios of traditionally used medicinal
species per total species in the family [4] by using residual
values in a medicinal species vs. total species per family

linear regression; showing how different cultures actually
use rational (non-random and empirical) approaches in
emphasizing certain taxa for their herbal remedies by
focusing on plants with certain growth habits and ecology
or in certain active families [4,11]; and using informant
consensus– the number of healers who agree on a particular plant use- to corroborate the usefulness of certain
plants and remove some uncertainty from collaborator
interviews [6,12,3]. Albuquerque et al. [13] have shown
how two indices, use values [3] and relative importance
values, correlate when applied to the same data set, but
diverge in certain cases because relative importance
emphasizes the absolute number of uses and the use value
emphasizes informant consensus. The relational efficacy
index proposed here tries to combine these two
approaches into one coherent measure by integrating
cross-cultural and intra-cultural informant consensus as
well as the disease-treating and plant-phylogenetic consensus.
Andrade-Cetto et al. [14] have introduced an interesting
extension to informant consensus they call "disease consensus," which despite its name analyzes how multiple
informants agree on and have knowledge of medicinal
plants to treat one particular disease (not between several
related diseases). This index tries to get around some of
the inconsistencies of standard informant consensus techniques, but has yet to be definitively corroborated by
other established indices or bioassays of disease treating
efficacy. Reyes-García et al. [15] have compared eight
common indices of traditional ecological knowledge and
found them to correlate fairly well. Some of these indices
can be independently validated (ecological cultural
knowledge), giving some external validity to the other
indices.
Johns et al. [16] has proposed a very interesting quantitative system for determining those plants in an ethnobotanical survey with the highest medical potential, based
on a log-linear model that teases out what is called the
"interaction effect," which is what is left when the higher
likelihood of finding a common plant treatment for a
Page 3 of 28

Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2007, 3:36

common disease is controlled for in a matrix of plants and
their medicinal uses. In other words, Johns et al. claim
that this residual amount leftover when the probability of
encountering common plants and common diseases is
subtracted out explains the real efficacy of the plant medicine, a bit like Moerman's [4] residuals for medicinally
speciose families. Although they call for verification by
comparing the interaction-effect potential with efficacy
determined by bioassays or current literature, they only
attempt this qualitatively, not putting numbers on the
medical efficacy of the plants found in the literature. Their
work has been cited often e.g. [17-19], and the original
authors have used this model in further studies [20,21],
although they seem to reject the model for lack of statistical significance [22]. One shortcoming is that Johns et al.
never defend their choice of a log-linear model to describe
people's choices of medicinal plants. They also perform a
sort of cross-cultural analysis with their results, noting
that the top ten potential plants they have found are used
similarly in many cultures, but again, the cross-cultural
aspect of this analysis is not quantitative.
Browner et al. [23] have designed a system that allows
quantitative cross-cultural comparisons of medicinal
plant treatments by determining through biomedical literature searches which of the plants used by a certain culture for a particular disease have been shown to have
some biochemical effect on the symptoms or causes of
that disease. This is an enticing approach, combining a scientific and a cultural viewpoint while analyzing both a
local cultural disorder, susto, and more physical female
reproductive disorders, but their reliance on existing biomedical and biochemical literature means that rating and
comparing plants that have not been studied in the laboratory is quite difficult. Juan et al. [24] have devised a
quantitative method of finding similarities in traditional
herbal medicine systems of Asia using statistical clustering
algorithms on the plants used by each system to treat a set
of diseases, but have stated that more innovative and
broad methods are needed. Mace and Pagel [25] have formalized cross-cultural comparisons using methods borrowed from systematics, mapping out cultural traits such
as plant use on language-based cultural phylogenies to
determine if these traits are basal or derived. Ostraff [26]
uses fuzzy clustering algorithms to look at how tapa cloth
knowledge moves among several Polynesian islands.
Weiss [27] shows how clustering algorithms can be used
to find similarities in disease etiology and medicinal
plants between the divergent traditional medicine of
China and the Chatino of Mexico, elucidating some similarities in their concepts of disease causation.
Bennett and Prance [28] discuss related disease systems in
deriving their species importance values from the number
of body systems on which a medicinal plant species works

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/3/1/36

and the number of pharmacological actions attributed to
it, but this does not incorporate how these disease systems
or actions are related. Yet the techniques described mainly
allow only comparing and describing differences between
cultures and their remedies, not the synthesis of several
cultures' knowledge to pinpoint the potentially mosteffective herbal remedies. Additionally, no one yet seems
to have combined these methods of plant, disease, and
cultural relatedness into one analytical system as proposed here.

Plant knowledge communication
The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a set of formulas that will give us an estimate of the disease-treating
potential of each plant species studied. Those plants with
the highest potential would be the best candidates for
undertaking the lengthy and expensive process of exploring their efficacy, phytochemistry and mechanisms of
activity in the human body in the lab and in clinical trials,
increasing the hit rate and lowering the cost of finding and
testing new botanical medicines. This measure should be
reproducible between different investigators and therefore objective and even useful in predicting the potential
a certain species for which medicinal use data has not
been collected may have for treating a certain uninvestigated disease.
One assumption of this technique is that the less related
the cultures in the study are, such as Mali and Peru vs.
Guatemala and Peru, the less chance those two cultures
have had of communicating medicinal plant knowledge.
If several unrelated cultures use closely related plants to
treat the same disease, these discoveries of the effectiveness of the plants are more likely to be independent, and
these plants should therefore be considered to have a
higher potential than other plants that may be used for
that disease in only one culture. To assess this assumption, the processes by which knowledge of medicinal
plants is disseminated among cultures when different cultures interact and possibly intermingle needs to be well
understood. Does the culture to which another culture
migrates pick up a significant portion of the medicinal
plant knowledge of the immigrant culture? Johnson [29],
Palmer [30,31], Campos et al. [32] and Cox [33], have discussed these mechanisms of medicinal plant knowledge
transfer, but this needs to be quantified on a more global
basis. Lenaerts [34] confirms this concept for closely
related cultures by showing that Peruvian Amazon indigenous groups like the Asháninka do not borrow medicinal
plants based on the plants' efficacy from nearby groups
such as the Shipibo, but rather based on each groups relations with and respect for their neighboring groups and
their medicinal plant knowledge, with the caveat that the
biomedical efficacies of the medicinal plants were not
tested in the laboratory as part of this research.

The intercultural exchange of medicinal plants that do not
undergo long-term experimentation in the culture that
adopts these plants can confound the effects of experimentation that leads to acceptance of the most effective
medicinal species. The ratio of medicinal species to total
species in each plant family has been used in the past to
make cross-cultural comparisons of medicinal plants,
contrasting the medicinal flora of Jammu and Kashmir,
India with that of the North American Indians [11] by
comparing Moerman's [4] plant family residual values.
Heinrich et al. [35] made some simple cross-cultural comparisons of Mexican indigenous groups and said that
selection of plants in traditional medicine is definitely not
random. Rather, a rational process of experimentation
and exchanges between cultures goes on, sometimes up to
a 70% exchange of medicinal plants with the example of
the Gitksan of Western Canada and their neighboring
groups [29].

1. The two cultures have independently discovered that
these two related plants treat the diseases effectively
through experimentation and have not communicated
these uses to each other. This explanation best fits the
stated theory.

Many of these studies have been ad hoc, asking only
whether the two cultures are connected or not, instead of
how connected they are, losing some of the information
in their analysis of the measure of relatedness of cultures.
There is an important quantitative difference between two
neighboring groups in Peru using similar plants to treat a
disease, and groups in Peru and Mali using similar plants
to treat the same disease. The latter case is much more suggestive that the two cultures independently discovered
similar plant uses, and that this was not communicated
plant knowledge as in the example of the Gitksan [29].
Campos and Ehringhaus [32] have found that a quarter to
a third of species-specific plant uses of two indigenous
groups in the Brazilian Amazon, the Kaxinawá and Yawanawá, have been acquired from neighboring non-indigenous seringueiros (rubber tappers) or ribeirinhos (river
dwelling people). Cox [33] claims that much of Polynesian herbal medicine is an indigenous tradition although
there are some introductions, and that 66% of medicinal
plants used in Polynesia are not used elsewhere, and are
therefore unlikely to be European introductions, while
34% have some use outside of Polynesia. In various studies analyzed between 1838 and 2002, Palmer [30] found
that anywhere from 14–53% of medicinal plants used in
Hawai'i were Polynesian introduced species, although this
is a bit different from introduced uses. These figures contrast Johnson's much higher 70% shared medicinal plant
use figure, perhaps because of the greater cultural and geographic proximity of the Gitksan and their neighbors. If
this degree of relations of the cultures being studies can be
quantified as I am proposing, it can give us much more
information about how much medicinal plant knowledge
the cultures would naturally share.

4. The two cultures have communicated to each other this
medicinal plant use through immigration, literature, or
other media moving from one culture to another.

The possible explanations for two different cultures using
similar plants to treat related diseases are:

2. The two cultures have independently decided to use
these two related plants to treat the diseases, but one or
both of the cultures has used the plants only for a short
time, without much experimentation, and therefore there
is less evidence that these plants are medicinally effective.
3. The two cultures have independently decided to use
these two related plants to treat the diseases through the
doctrine of signatures, which is a common method of
medicinal plant discovery around the world [36], and the
related diseases are likely to effect the same organ system
and the related plants are likely to look the same.

The reason that it is important to look at less related cultures is that with increasing distance between cultures, the
probability of option 4 goes down and the probabilities of
options 1, 2, and 3 increase, with less possibility of communication. The ratio of options 1, 2, and 3 to each other
is unclear, but asking questions such as how long a medicinal plant has been used during interviews helps to
increase the probability of option 1 vs. options 2 and 3, as
there has been more time for experimentation and verification with a particular plant remedy. Using informant
consensus techniques during interviews about a medicinal plant [3] can act as a stand-in for the length of use of
the plant remedy as a higher informant consensus value
indicates that the plant has been better tested by the community, again increasing the probability of option 1.
Giving many clear examples, Bennett [36] proposes that
the doctrine of signatures is a mnemonic method for
remembering many medicinal plants, rather than a
method of choosing medicinal plants merely based on
their signatures. This implies that plants to which the doctrine of signature applies are actually quite well tested and
known to be effective, rather than being chosen merely
because they resemble the disease or affected organ.
Accepting this conclusion would lead to option 3 being
less of a confounding factor, as the plants would be well
tested as in option 1.

A comparative case study using families and
genera

sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis), Chagas disease,
leishmaniasis, asthma, eczema, diabetes, and uterine
fibroids were selected to test the prerequisite hypothesis to
the general theory that the medicinal flora of two distant
cultures are significantly more similar to each other than
the general flora of the two cultures areas are similar.
Cultures
In choosing cultures for this study, the more remote and
more recently contacted a group is the better, as they will
have less chance of introduced plant uses. Although the
cultures selected must be as distant as possible, it is also
necessary that they share some elements of their floras.
The areas compared need not have the exact same species,
but if they share some genera or families it will make
determining the plants' relatedness values easier. In comparing the flora of Peruvian Amazon and the dry savannas
of Mali, we have found that 21% of their genera overall
and 30% of the medicinal plant genera of the Mali savannas are also found in Southwest Amazon area of Peru [3740]. So although at first glance it might seem ludicrous to
try to compare the medicinal floras of such divergent habitats as a rainforest and a savanna, this flora overlap percentage is high enough to make a more in-depth
comparison of the medicinal plants of the two areas. The
fact that the cultures of the Peruvian Amazon and the Malian savannas are so distantly related that they are very
unlikely to have communicated medicinal plant uses to
each other also raises the probability that any related
plants used by both of them to treat related diseases are
independent discoveries, which strengthens the quantitative model. Lewis et al. [23] has suggested the same idea
that use of similar medicinal plants by nearby Jívaro communities in the Peruvian Amazon corroborates those uses
and the medicinal efficacy of the plants.

The Asháninka (alternatively Campa, Asháninca,
Ashéninka, and Ashéninca), the fourth largest indigenous
group in Peru after the Quechua, Aymara, and Aguaruna,
number about 25,000–30,000, and speak the Asháninka
language in the Arawak language family, which is divided
into 4 dialects: Pajonal, Yuruá-Ucayali, Perené, and Pichis
[41,42]. Spread throughout southern Amazonian Peru
and extending into neighboring Acre, Brazil, the
Asháninka enjoy immense notoriety for introducing the
antirheumatic use of their medicinal plant cat's claw or
uña de gato (Uncaria tomentosa (Willd. ex Roem. & Schult.)
DC. and U. guianensis (Aubl.) J.F. Gmel. [Rubiaceae]) [43]
to the world, yet there is a paucity of ethnobotanical data
on them. This plant is now used throughout Peru and
much of the Western world for arthritis, asthma, cancer,
contraception, fevers, ulcers, wound healing, and urinary
tract inflammations, to name a few uses, but Keplinger
claims to have proven its effectiveness as an immune
booster and is currently working on marketing a drug in

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/3/1/36

Europe for rheumatoid arthritis derived from U. tomentosa
called Saventaro™, the Asháninka name for this plant.
There is much written about the Asháninka in general [4449], about their political situation stemming from conflict
with the Shining Path revolutionaries in Peru [50-52], linguistic and cultural anthropology [42,53-56], and there is
some recent ethnobotanical work on the Asháninka food
plants, medicinal plants and medical system [57]. Because
of the worldwide acclaim and use of cat's claw introduced
by the Asháninka, the rest of their herbal pharmacopoeia
deserves study. As Lenaerts [57] has described, the
Asháninka medical system emphasizes the relations of
people, plants, and diseases making them a perfect fit for
the theoretical "relational efficacy" system.
The Asháninka community of Paititi is located in the
Southwest Amazon vegetation zone in the Ucayali
Department of Peru, near the Brazilian border (see Figure
1). The Asháninka who live in Paititi mostly speak the
Yuruá Asháninka dialect, although some speak the Perené
dialect as well, and there are one to two visiting teachers
who are indigenous Shipibo, also from Ucayali Department. In the two years of fieldwork in Paititi (2003 and
2004) the population of the community fluctuated
between 25–30 people, comprising 6 families living in
separate palm thatch and wood houses. The surrounding
agricultural fields and rainforest are typical of the Southwest Amazon habitat [58].
In Mali, working with the Département de Médecine Traditionnelle (Department of Traditional Medicine, DMT) in
the capital Bamako, and their connections with the Association des Thérapeutes Traditionnels de Kita (Association of
Traditional Healers of Kita) in Kita, in the Western extent
of Mali, I was able to interview fifteen Malinké healers
during field work in 2004. The Malinké, one of the largest
ethnic groups in Mali, with about 600,000 members,
speak a combination of French, Bamanakan, and
Malinké, and are generally Muslim, animist, or a combination thereof [41,59]. There is little ethnobotanical work
solely on the Malinké, mostly because they are intermixed
with the Songhay, Pelou, Bozo, Tuareg and other ethnic
groups throughout Mali, but many of their medicinal
plants are included in works on the ethnobotany of West
Africa [37,38,60,61].
The field site of Kita, in the western end of Mali (see Figure
2), is in the Sudanese savanna area with some Guinean
gallery forest vegetation type reaching up into the southern end of the town but with fewer of the baobab trees
(Adansonia digitata L. [Malvaceae]) common in the eastern
part of the country [61].

the Huacapishtea River.

Diseases
A criterion for selecting diseases to study is to find diseases
that occur in Peru and/or Mali and are related and have
the same underlying cause in the body. Using these criteria, malaria, African sleeping sickness, Chagas' disease,
leishmaniasis, diabetes, eczema, asthma, and uterine
fibroids have been selected. Diabetes, eczema, and asthma
were picked as all three are autoimmune diseases, with the
latter two more closely associated in the "auto-immune
triad". The third member of this autoimmune triad is hay
fever, which was not included in this study because it is
not thought to be common in the indigenous groups
selected. If one culture treats asthma with a certain plant
and another distant culture treats eczema with the same
plant, although these diseases seem superficially very different, they are considered closely related auto-immune
diseases by Western medicine and therefore could be
treated by the same plant chemicals acting on the under-

lying mechanism of the immune system. Thus, these two
distant uses of the same plant for eczema and asthma can
be considered similar uses, raising the estimate of the efficacy of this plant.
Malaria, leishmaniasis, African sleeping sickness, and
Chagas' disease are all caused by a protozoan parasite
infection, the latter three more specifically by a trypanosome (family Trypanosomatidae), and the latter two
being in the same genus Trypanosoma [62-64], thereby
exhibiting different degrees of evolutionary proximity.
Studying uterine fibroids allows comparison of my work
in Peru with ethnobotanical research that has been done
on this disease in Chile and among Dominican and Chinese groups in New York City by the Rosenthal Center for
Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center (CPMC) [65]. Of the diseases mentioned, however, uterine fibroids is the most

would be interviewed again later about the same disease,
but the second time it would be named in their local language and in the country's official language (Spanish or
French) if they spoke that language. This dual description
of each disease by symptoms and name will provide valuable information on whether more effective medicinal
plants are found by describing symptoms or by naming
diseases, once the efficacy of each plant has been determined.

difficult to study solely with interviews as it has few outwardly apparent symptoms.
Methodology
To accomplish this cross-cultural study, ethnobotanical
data was gathered in structured interviews and plant collections with healers of the indigenous Asháninka of Paititi village in Ucayali, Peru and the Malinké of Kita, Mali
in 2003 and 2004, focusing on plants used to treat
malaria, African sleeping sickness, Chagas' disease, leishmaniasis, asthma, eczema, diabetes, and uterine fibroids.
Prior informed consent forms cleared with the City University of New York Institutional Review Board (CUNY
IRB) on human subjects were signed with everyone interviewed that guaranteed immediate compensation for the
healer's time, return of documentation of the results of the
study to the community [66], that pharmaceuticals would
not made from the medicinal plants described in the
study, and that the names of the plants would not be
revealed to anyone outside the study.

Cultural notions of disease are difficult to deal with
because of different symptomatic descriptions for what
may be the same underlying disease. Working with medical texts, doctors, translators, and healers of each culture,
the symptoms of a disease in that culture and the name of
the disease in the local language (Asháninka or Bambara)
were determined to help resolve this issue. During interviews, diseases were at first only described by their Western medical symptoms, not by name, and the collaborator
was asked to name the disease and the plants used to treat
it. If a particular collaborator did not give the name of the
disease in their language based the stated symptoms, they

With the help of the collaborators, species described in the
interviews were collected in quadruplicate when accessible to make into a small-scale reference herbarium for the
communities in the study; for deposit in the study countries' main herbaria, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San
Marcos (USM) in Peru and the Département de Médecine
Traditionnelle in Mali (not listed in Index Herbariorum);
for sending to a family expert at other herbaria; and for
deposit in my institutional herbarium (NY). Species were
identified with the help of Gentry [67], Arbonnier [61],
the aforementioned herbaria's collection, their staff, and
several taxonomic experts.
The families and genera of the general flora have been
determined for Kita, Mali from Arbonnier [61] and for
Paititi, Peru from Daly and Silvera [58] which covers the
state of Acre, Brazil, which is also in the Southwest Amazon floristic zone in which Paititi is found. However,
because of the prior informed consent agreements with
my collaborators, neither species, genus, nor family
names are given, as has become fairly common practice in
recent medical ethnobotanical research [68-72,5,73]. This
paper shows that despite not revealing plant names, there
is interesting work that can be published with this data
that advances the science of ethnobotany. A summary of
the field collections and overlap percentages (the number
of each taxa that were found in both field sites divided by
the number of total taxa found when the taxa from both
field sites are combined, or intersection of the taxa/union
of the taxa) is given in Table 1.

Analysis
These original data comprise an accurate database of
shared plant uses which can be analyzed using the
described quantitative system and compared with data
gathered on the same diseases from other areas of the
world. Further literature research on the collected plant
species and chemical analysis will be necessary to measure
the relatedness of the plants, cultures, and diseases
involved in the study using dated phylogenies and to calibrate the quantitative system using well-studied medicinal plants.

Part of the hypothesis of this work is that the medicinal
floras of the different cultures are taxonomically more
similar than the general floras of the geographic areas
where the cultures are located. This hypothesis is relatively
easy to test using contingency tables of the overlapping
medicinal and general flora of the two cultures, the oddsratio or Jaccard similarity index of these tables, and resampling statistic techniques, a technique that recalculates
statistics thousands of times while resampling from collected data [74]. Approximate randomization or resampling statistics techniques are in the same family of
numerical approaches to statistical analysis that sample
without replacement as Monte Carlo methods, essentially
reshuffling the labels or experimental group on each collected datum. Monte Carlo methods differ, however, in
that they create new data based on theoretical probability
distributions of the system under study.
Contingency tables are used in statistical comparisons of
counts of occurrences of outcomes in several populations
with different experimental groups, most often in two by
two tables. The odds ratio (OR) statistic is calculated as
N present in Peru, present in Mali N absent in Peru, absent in Mali
N present in Peru, absent in Mali N absent in Peru, present in Mali

(1)
where each N is the count from one of the four central
squares of the contingency table, which would be

57⋅266
= 18.581
136⋅6
in the case of Table 2, comparing the families of the general flora of Peru and Mali. In these tables, the OR explains
that an outcome is a certain amount more likely for one
experimental group versus another, e.g. that if a family is
present in the Peruvian Amazon flora it is 18.581 times
more likely to be present than absent in the Malian
savanna flora in the case shown in Table 2.

the odds ratio and Jaccard similarity for the general flora. Odds

The Jaccard similarity index is a measure of the overlap of
the two sets and is calculated by the intersection of the two
sets divided by the union of the two sets, i.e.

N present in Peru, present in Mali
N present in Peru, present in Mali + N present in Peru, absent in Mali + N absent in Peru, present in Mali

(2)
It should be noted that the Jaccard similarity calculation
does not use the number of taxa absent from both sets
(e.g. 266 in Table 2), while the odds ratio calculation
does.
The null hypothesis Ho here that we wish to reject is that
just by chance the two cultures have wound up with similar medicinal floras merely by selecting from similar general floras, i.e., the odds-ratio or Jaccard similarity index of
the medicinal flora is no greater than the odds-ratio or Jaccard index of the general flora than chance would allow.
Resampling statistics will here allow the calculation of the
statistical significance of the difference in the similarity of
the medicinal and general taxa contingency tables, a significance whose calculation is not well defined using
standard exact statistical techniques, by reshuffling the
numbers in the two contingency tables' categories thousands of times, keeping the row totals the same and recalculating the similarity difference between the tables for
each reshuffle. The significance p then is computed as Ng/
Nt where Ng is the number of reshuffles where the medicinal floras' similarity is higher than the similarity of the
general floras and Nt is the total number of reshuffles.
To calculate these similarities, contingency tables were
created of the families and genera found in the medicinal
and general flora of the Southwest Amazon area of Peru
and in Mali, using Angiosperm Phylogeny Group [75]
designations and total worldwide counts for families and

genera. Resampling statistics were calculated 10,000 times
using a 500 MHz Apple PowerBook Pismo running Resampling Stats version 4.0 [76], with each table comparison
run taking several minutes to complete. There resulting
list of contingency tables, odds-ratios, similarity values,
and significance for families and genera for each disease
and disease category as well as the general flora are given
in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
18, 19, 20, 21.
When these contingency tables comparing the general
flora of Mali and the Southwest Amazon area of Peru with
the medicinal plants of the Asháninka and Malinké are
examined, it is clear that there is significant similarity
within the general flora and the medicinal flora from the
G test, and that the medicinal flora has a significantly
higher similarity between the two areas than the general
flora's similarity. It can be seen from these tables that in
all cases where the medicinal flora similarity or odds-ratio
is greater than those of the general flora (numbers in italics), it is statistically significant. This allows us to accept
our prerequisite hypothesis H1, but if we look more
deeply into the disease categories and the difference
between the genus and family taxa levels, the results
become more complicated and less consistent. There
seems to be more significant results of higher similarity in
medicinal plants for individual diseases and categories
than in the general flora when looking at genera rather
than families, as shown in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and the summary
in Table 22. There is also variation in significance when
looking at different disease ranks, i.e., individual disease
vs. disease categories such as parasitic or autoimmune diseases.
Table 23 shows the distribution of plant taxa used to treat
different diseases and categories in Peru, Mali, and the
combination thereof. In the combined medicinal flora of
Peru and Mali the majority of plant taxa are used to treat
autoimmune diseases (20.60% of families present, 5.91%

has the highest representation (16.08% of families
present, 3.23% of genera present). Parasitic diseases are
the second-highest-represented category (17.59% of families present, 4.57% of genera present), with malaria best
represented within this category (20.60% of families
present, 5.91% of genera present). For the Peruvian
medicinal flora, this same pattern of the predominance of
autoimmune diseases and diabetes within that continues,
but within the second-highest-represented category of
parasitic diseases, leishmaniasis predominates rather than
malaria (5.70% of families present, 1.14% of genera
present). This may be due to leishmaniasis being native to
South America or at least present in South America much
longer than malaria, a relatively recent introduction [77].
In Mali, auto-immune diseases are still the predominant
category (41.27% of families present, 17.78% of genera
present), but within this category, eczema rather than diabetes is the best represented (5.70% of families present,
1.14% of genera present), most likely because of the drier
environmental conditions that often bring on eczema and

fewer of the high-starch foods such as yuca (Manihot esculenta Crantz [Euphorbiaceae]) that can exacerbate diabetes. Within the parasitic disease category in Mali, also the
second best represented, malaria is best represented
(30.16% of families present, 14.22% of genera present) as
opposed to leishmaniasis in Peru, most likely due to
malaria's origins in Africa [78]. It should be noted that
these differences are only statistically significant when
considering the combined medicinal floras of Peru and
Mali and the disease categories, not individual diseases.
Unfortunately I cannot include further analysis such as
family or genera distributions as there are several families
with only one or a few species present in both Peru and
Mali, so merely naming the family would reveal the species used for a particular disease and break my confidentiality agreement not to publish previously unpublished
species uses.
This confirmation of the hypothesis at the high level but
with inconsistencies at the lower levels shows that we
need to move away from analyzing plant and disease data
in these somewhat artificial groupings as they will give us
unverifiable results depending on what level the data is
analyzed (e.g. species, genus, or family; individual disease

or disease category) and which published groupings we
used (e.g. the old Malvaceae sensu strictu or the new Malvaceae sensu latu which includes the old Malvaceae, Sterculiaceae, Tiliaceae, and Bombacaceae [75]). Instead we
need to put into practice a system that uses more universal
notions of groupings that are not quite so objective and
rapidly changing. Using phylogenies to measure evolutionary distance, phytochemistry to gauge how similar
disease-treating mechanisms and the compounds in different plants are, and cultural genomic phylogenies can
give us more robust information about the relations of
plants, diseases, and cultures that should give us more
consistent results. It is on these systems that the following
theoretical quantitative cross-cultural synthesis technique
called "relational efficacy" is based.

Mathematical background
The hypothesis is that in a database with Ns species, Nd diseases, and Nc cultures, the potential of a certain species s,
from one culture c, to treat a certain disease d, (Ps,d,c)
should increase with greater phylogenetic proximity of
other plants s' used to treat related diseases (Rs,s'), increase
with greater etiological proximity of the disease d' treated
by related plants (Rd,d'), and increase with less phylogenetic proximity of cultures c' using related plants to treat

related diseases (Rc,c'), but it should not increase solely by
increasing the size of the dataset. These relatedness factors, discussed further below, would be 1 for two plants,
diseases, or cultures that are exactly the same, and would
decrease towards 0 as they became less related, e.g., 1/time
to their most recent branch point on a phylogenetic tree.
Thus we assume that the less related or connected two cultures are, the more likely their discovery of related plants
to treat related diseases is an independent event and therefore should increase the plants' medical potential.
The basic formula for the potential Ps,d,c of species s to treat
disease d in culture c proposed to meet these conditions is:

where the relatedness factors are summed over all species,
diseases, and cultures where species s is used to treat disease d in culture c and species s' is used to treat disease d'
in culture c'. Ns is the number of species, Nd is the number
of diseases, and Nc is the number of cultures. If a species is
not used to treat a disease it does not add to the potential,
nor however does it subtract, as it is difficult to make the
negative assertion that a particular plant is never used to
treat a disease. More interviews may uncover that use. The

number of species Ns, diseases Nd, and cultures Ncare
divided out to normalize the equation and ensure that the
potential of a plant does not increase solely by increasing
the sample size. The plant species and disease relatedness
values are in the numerator so that the plant's potential
increases with higher plant and disease relatedness, and
the culture relatedness value is in the denominator so that
the plant's potential increases with lower culture relatedness. It must be emphasized that this is merely an ad hoc
formula proposed to meet the assumptions of the hypothesis, but the actual equation will have to be modified with
weighting factors, power factors, and/or constants added
to it to model the actual data as closely as possible.

the remedy might be:

instead for weighting.

An example is in order here to demonstrate how these formulae work. Take diseases X and Y, and the plant species
A, B, and C used to treat them in cultures M and N, as
illustrated in Tables 24 and 25. If the relatedness between
plants is defined as RAB = 0.5, RAC = 0.7, and RBC = 0.5; the
relatedness between cultures is RMN = 0.75; and the relatedness between diseases RXY = 0.3 then

Where ts',d',c' is the length of time that species s' has been
used to treat disease d' in culture c' in a particular time unit
(most likely years), while tmax is the maximum amount of
time in the same units that any plant has been used in the
entire dataset. This would ensure internal consistency
within the cultures by giving a higher weight to plants that
have been used longer and improve the accuracy of the
data, by raising the probability of experimentation and
validation within a culture for a particular plant use. If
available, informant consensus values would be more
accurate since the length of time used is self-reported and
therefore more prone to errors as a weighting measure. In
my own interviews, I asked each healer how long they in
particular had used each remedy and how long they
remembered it being used by people in their village, as a
backup in case the total number of healers interviewed
was too low to use informant consensus on any one remedy. In cases where only a few healers recognized a disease, the informant consensus would most likely not be

and so on through the table, yielding Tables 26 and 27 for
the calculation of Ps,d,c. When these two tables are
summed and normalized for the number of cultures (2),
this yields Table 28 for Ps,d. From Table 28 we can see that
species A has the highest potential (0.322) to treat disease
X, and species B has the highest potential (0.350) to treat
disease Y, while species A has the highest overall potential
(0.322) and would probably be the first species we would
want to analyze in the laboratory of the three.
If disease Y had not been studied in this example, the
potentials would have come out as PA = 0.291, PB =
0.240, and PC = 0.240, which we can see is not much different from the normalized row (divided by the number
of diseases) in the above table. The potentials have the
same rankings of the species and the same magnitude.
This shows how the potential is not affected by the size of
the dataset (the total number of diseases studied, in this
case). Species A still has the highest potential of the three.

Mixtures of plants are found in many herbal medicines
[65] and the necessary synergy involved in plant mixtures

Banisteriopsis caapi (Spruce ex Griseb.) C.V. Morton [Malpighiaceae] containing the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) harmine and harmaline, and Psychotria viridis
Ruiz & Pav. [Rubiaceae], containing the endogenous neurotransmitter dimethyl tryptamine (DMT), neither of
which plant would have much effect ingested on their
own as the DMT gets broken down in the digestive tract by
monoamine oxidase (MAO). However, the combination
of the MAOI's in the B. caapi blocking the breakdown
effect of the MAO, allowing the DMT to enter the brain,
creates one of the most powerful natural hallucinogens
known. In another example, Lewis et al. [71] found that
the combination of two anti-malarial compounds from a
Peruvian plant used by the Aguaruna had a 25–33%
higher malarial-inhibition effect than the sum of the inhibitions of the individual compounds, i.e., over a quarter
of the activity of this compound mixture was synergistic.
5'-methoxyhydnocarpin, found in several species of Berberis [Berberidaceae], stopped multi-drug resistant pumps
found in Staphylococcus aureus from pumping the antimicrobial berberine alkaloids, also found in these same Berberis species, out of the cell, the two compounds in
combination being much more effective against the
microbe as either compound on its own [79]. Raskin and
Ripoll [80] give a good review of the many antifungal,

activities currently known and say there is a great need for
such synergistic plant medicines, for instance for multidrug resistant pathogens and AIDS. Even the United States
Food and Drug Administration is accepting clinical trials
of botanical drugs with multiple plant components in
their Guidance for Industry Botanical Drug Products [81],
a change from their former oppositional stance towards
botanicals and the difficulty of getting multiple component drugs approved. With all these clear cases of powerful synergistic medicinal effects in plants, how can we deal
with the confusing non-linearity of multi-compound and
even multiple-plant mixtures with hundreds of potentially active compounds?
The plant potential equations above can be adapted to
highlight cases where plants are used synergistically,
where plants from one phylogenetic clade are often
present in a mixture along with plants from another clade,
showing the former plants to be important admixtures
even if they never appear alone as a medicine. This would
imply that the compounds common in one clade are
working together with compounds common in the second clade, one either reinforcing the other, or subduing
toxic side effects (see Figure 3).

in high-potential mixtures, but are not recorded as being
used alone for the same disease.
Uncertainty
Even if all the medicinal plants collected cannot be identified to species with confidence, something that is quite
common in ethnobotany where collaborators may just
give the researcher the ground-up leaves or roots of a plant
to identify [65], these data can still be used by employing
resampling statistics methods. Most ethnobotanists eliminate data on plants they cannot fully identify, but if a
plant is identified as a particular genus, or from the plant's
common name it can be inferred that it is one of several
possible unrelated species, this information can be used
to derive medicinal efficacy potentials for the plant. Common-name uncertainty is much more difficult to use than
uncertainty of several species within one genus, as the
actual species corresponding to a common name could be
in any of several disparate genera or families, or just completely misidentified by the collaborator. The potential
value calculated will not be as exact as if there is a specieslevel identification for the plant. Instead, it will have a
range of values or confidence intervals derived using resampling statistics techniques, where the potential efficacy

of each collected plant is calculated thousands of times
while resampling from collected data to give potential values for the different combinations of possible plant species identifications. These thousands of calculated
potentials are then used to find an average potential and
an error range for those unknown plants. In the case of
common-name uncertainty, if the dataset is small and the
uncertain species are key to the potential calculations (i.e.
when one of the possible species is used to treat a disease
closely related to other diseases and is closely related to
many other species in the dataset), the calculated potentials may be in several discrete ranges rather than one as
the input species' relatedness values would be quite disparate. The more incompletely identified plants there are in
a dataset, the more uncertainty there is (e.g. from many
possible species corresponding to a common name), and
the greater the error ranges of the plant potential will be,
but this will still often be enough to rank it in a list of
plants with the highest potentials. This usage of incomplete data in ethnobotany would be quite useful in many
studies.
Non-native species
Medicinal plant uses that have been introduced into a culture from another culture must be eliminated from the

data, as they are less likely to be independent discoveries of
the same plant use. We do not want cases such as jambol
(Syzygium cumini (L.) Skeels [Myrtaceae]) being used in
European herbal medicine to treat diabetes, as this is a
native of Asia and therefore a case of transmitted information and not independent discovery. Because of this, a
good understanding is required of the introduced vs. traditional plant uses and how this medicinal knowledge is
disseminated. Introduced plant uses can be determined
by comparing the plant use data gathered to any previous
ethnobotanical surveys done in the cultures being studied
to see if their uses are changing over time. If the collaborators in the studied cultures describe these new uses as
being from outside their culture, as Campos et al. [32] has
documented with the Yawanawá and Kaxinawá in Brazil,
these should be considered introduced uses, rather than
self-discovered uses, and eliminated from the data. If no
previous ethnobotanical surveys exist for these cultures,
floras of the area which describe whether plants are native
or introduced can be used to eliminate any uses of introduced plants from the data. Newly-discovered medicinal
uses of introduced species, as opposed to introduced uses of
plants, might be worth keeping in the database if the two
subtle cases can be differentiated, as they may be tested
uses and just as valid as uses of native species. An intro-

duced species being used in its introduced area A for a disease X related to the disease Y for which it is used in the
species' native area B is even more ambiguous, as one
must definitively determine that the culture of area A does
not consider diseases X and Y to be related and therefore
that this is an introduced use. Bennett and Prance [28] discuss introduced medicinal species at length, saying they
are well represented in the pharmacopoeia of Northern
South America. This is not to claim that introduced species are ineffective, but rather that it is difficult to say how
long they have existed in a certain area and therefore
whether they have been truly tested there and if this use is
an independent discovery from the uses in the plants'
native area. Clues such as local plant names and introduced species' ranges cannot clearly date the species'
introduction and therefore the amount of experimentation with the plant.
The local plant names can be some indication of an introduced use, i.e., local plant names not in the local language
provides some evidence, albeit not definitive, that the use
has traveled along with the name from the plant's native
area to the introduced area [82,29]. Introduced uses moving from one native area of a plant to another native area
of the plant where there are local names in both areas are

more complicated, as the use may transfer without the
name. Therefore, it is important to look at the natural
range and local names of the plants considered.
As an example, in Peru the Asháninka use the Indiannative neem tree (Azadirachta indica A. Juss. [Meliaceae])
to treat diabetes (personal observation, 2003), a use that
is found in India as well. When asked how this use came
about, Raúl Casanto Shingari, the chief of the Asháninka
village of Paititi said that the neem tree was introduced to
certain areas of Peru, such as the Amazon city of Pucallpa,
when some Peruvians went to Costa Rica for an agriculture workshop, where they learned of the excellent pesticidal qualities of neem. Not having heard anything about
its diabetes-treating qualities, one of the Asháninka who
had diabetes tried a tea of it because of the bitter taste of
the neem leaves and saw a rapid improvement in his condition. He then told his companions about this use, and
its use spread around the community. If all of the facts of
Raúl's story are correct, this would be a case of independently discovered use of an introduced plant, and can be
included in the dataset. In Mali, neem is very common in

large towns as a street tree that was introduced in 1950,
the year of Malian independence, and is therefore called
"mali yirini" or "plant of Mali", yet none of the 15 healers
interviewed in Mali who were very familiar with the plant
used neem to treat diabetes. In this case, even if neem had
been used for diabetes or other diseases, because of the
wide distribution of neem and much higher immigration
to the area from the Indian subcontinent than to Peru, it
would have been very difficult to determine if this was an
introduced use, or an independently-discovered use of an
introduced plant.

Plant relationships
The idea that certain taxonomically related plant groups
(taxa) have a higher occurrence of medicinally active compounds in them we will call "taxon predominance" here.
The measurement of taxon predominance is somewhat
problematic because taxonomic rank is a somewhat arbitrary objective construct that leads to anomalies: when
simply counting medicinal plants in certain families, it
emphasizes larger families, and when finding percentages
of medicinal plants in families, it emphasizes small families [4]. Although these anomalies can be resolved somewhat by looking at residuals in predicted percentages, as
Moerman has, there are still a few problems. First, considering if two plants share a taxon is a binary question- are
plants A and B in the same family or not? – when we
would really like a continuous measure that would give us
more information from which to derive descriptive statistics – how closely related are plants A and B? Second, these
residuals are not normally distributed, making it difficult
but not impossible to analyze the significance of the differences in residuals as they violate the assumptions of
standard statistical analyses [74,83]. A randomization
technique such as Monte Carlo simulation or resampling
statistics may get around this issue, and this has been
done on a large database of Native American medicinal
plants, finding that plant families with statistically significantly low or high number of medicinal species do not
correlate with the families' species number and that most

likely certain families evolved chemical adaptations

selected more often by the Native Americans as medicinal

However, despite the statistical rigor of this last approach,
the third problem is that looking at taxon predominance
deals with taxa, which do not circumscribe consistent
degrees of proximity at the same ranks (taxa levels), i.e.,
two plants that are in family A are not necessarily as
closely related as two plants in family B. If a taxonomist
prefers to split large plant families, two species in different
families may in fact be more closely related than two species in the same genus in another large family, as Avise
and Johns [85] have discussed with the relatively recently
evolved, small group of primates (7 species) being split
across several families compared with the speciose, earlier-branching fruit flies with 12 species being grouped
into one genus. Avise and Johns have attempted to
address this somewhat by proposing a system in which

diseases X and Y by culture M, with a '+' if there is a record of a
plant being used to treat that disease in that culture and a '-' if
there is no such record.

different taxonomic ranks would strictly represent a measure of evolutionary relations by indicating the time since
divergence from the taxa's common ancestor. For
instance, genera would be species groups that branched
off from each other 5 million years ago, families would
have a branch point of 20 million years ago, and orders 45
million years ago. This proposed system, however, does
not take into account different rates of evolution in different branches under different evolutionary pressures.
To implement this we would have to know the time of the
evolutionary branch points for all described plants to be
able to put them in the correct taxa, but this information
is available for only a small percentage of known plants.
One technique that has had some success in putting dates
on evolutionary events uses molecular clocks to date
divergence points, where the rate of DNA or RNA mutation since a divergence point is measured and calibrated
against a known standard mutation rate [86,87]. This
seems to work best only in small plant groups, however,
as the supposed constant rate of DNA mutation across

large groups seems to break down, considering the fact
that plants evolve at different rates at different times in
history under different environmental conditions [88,89].
Inventive fixes to this variation can be performed, such as
using plant fossil data and the proposed taxonomy phylogenies of the flowering plants [90] to push back the
divergence date of sister plant taxa that are known to share
a common branch point [91]. The "Deep Time" project
[92,93], an attempt to bring together data from molecular
and morphological systematics, paleobotany, and geology to date many of the angiosperm evolutionary divergence events, will collect much of the data needed in one
place for finding plant relationships by their date of divergence from their most recent common ancestor. In the
near term, the inaccuracies of this system would allow it
to only be used for higher ranks such as families or orders,
so for lower ranks another system is needed.
A simple technique for measuring the genes common to
two plants, like re-annealing [94] where the time for separated DNA strands from the two plants to reconnect or
"re-anneal" with each other is determined, could be performed for plants in this study. This is a fast procedure,
and the re-annealing times derived from this could be
used as a measure of plant relatedness, but the number of
experiments necessary would quickly skyrocket as the
combinatorics of comparing each plant to all the others in
the study increases with large sample sizes. Comparing n

plants would require n!/(n-2)!2 physical experiments in
the test tube, reannealing each species' DNA with every
other species' DNA, which for even 50 plants would mean
1225 physical comparison experiments. Creating quick
chemical fingerprints or metabolite profiles [95] of all the
plants in the study can be determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [96,97], which
monitors the diffusion time and spectra of compounds in
a plant extract as they diffuse in a solvent through a column filled with different substrates, or diffusion-ordered
(DOSY) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging
[98,99] which uses NMR to create a fingerprint of multicompound plant extracts by mapping how these compounds diffuse over time under magnetic excitation. Both
these techniques would be a relatively easy way to avoid
the proliferating combinations of plant comparisons in
re-annealing as the fingerprints for each plant are
recorded on a computer, where calculating the relationships among all the combinations of plant fingerprints
could be done in minimal time. For 50 plants, only 50
physical readings need to be done with HPLC or DOSY
NMR, and the 1225 comparisons are calculated in the
computer using the output of these 50 tests, i.e., the data
can be reused. With re-annealing, every comparison of
two plants must be done physically in the test tube,

whereas with chemical fingerprinting the comparisons are
done on the computer.
This chemical-fingerprint approach to determining the
relationships of plants has two advantages over a phylogenetic molecular-clock approach. First, a chemical comparison gets more directly at what we are looking for in the
plants - are two plants sharing some secondary metabolites that would act in a similar way in the human body to
treat a disease - rather than using the proxy for metabolite
similarity of genetic similarity that phylogenies represent.
There are many steps (promotion, transcription, deletion,
folding, and synthesis pathways, to name a few) that separate similar DNA from similar metabolites. Second, for
plants for which there is no existing description of relationships - chemical, phylogenetic, or otherwise - it is
much easier to derive metabolite similarity of a random
sampling of plants from across the plant kingdom
through fingerprints, than to derive a dated phylogeny for
these isolated plants without the context of their genera,
families, and orders. The fingerprint approach has the disadvantage that one collection of a plant may only represent the metabolite fingerprint for that time of day,
season, location, stress level or plant part, as metabolites
can vary widely in the same species with all these dependent variables [96]. This problem can be worked around,
however, by sampling the plant part, time, and location as
the collaborators do, since this represents the metabolites
they are using in their herbal medicines, or by taking a
cross-section of all the parts, times of day, seasons, and
locations available to the healers and grouping all these
samples of one species as one plant when doing the fingerprint, as a way to try to get all the possible metabolites
that might be present in this species over all conditions.
The latter scheme may be impractical due to the immense
amount of collection time necessary, however.
Metabolite fingerprinting will work best with closely
related plants species, as plants in different families or
orders can often have such different secondary compounds that the extraction methods must be quite different and fingerprint data will have little or no similarities.
However, the fingerprint method of determining plant
relatedness will complement the dated phylogeny
method, as dated phylogenies have been determined
mainly for the broader scale of orders and families, but
not between genera and species as of yet. Therefore, the
dated phylogeny method of relatedness should be used to
determine broader scale relationships for those families
for which it exists, and, if needed, the fingerprint method
can be used to fill in at the smaller scale. A calculation of
both phylogenetic and metabolite relatedness for the
same set of species can be used to calibrate these different
systems to each other, if there is some area of overlap.

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/3/1/36

Another assumption of this technique is that phytochemicals are conserved across genera, families, or orders; there
is a basis for this, as phytochemicals have been used in the
past as a trait to create phylogenies in the field of plant
chemosystematics [100]. Many compounds are found
across entire families or orders, such as cyclopentenoid
cyanogenic glycosides found in the Achariaceae, Passifloraceae, Turneraceae, and Malesherbiaceae within the
order Malpighiales; betalains in the Caryophyllales; and
the sesquiterpene lactones common in the Asteraceae
[101]. Some compounds are found only in certain genera,
as with hypericin in Hypericum sp. [Clusiaceae] [102] and
betulin in the Betula genus [Betulaceae] [101]. This most
likely explains people's tendency to concentrate their
medicinal plants in certain families [2]; they are realizing
that some effects [103] or tastes [104] of a group of plants
are similar and therefore they are using other members of
that plant group to treat their diseases as they most likely
contain similar disease-treating components. Balunas
[105] has done an extensive analysis of how the percentage of active plants and average 50% effective concentration (EC50) values of anticancer activity in large plant
collections from around the world vary with the plant
part, collection location, and plant family, showing the
interesting trends that percent of active plants is not
higher in areas with higher biodiversity, but is higher in
the Clusiaceae, Elaeocarpaceae, Meliaceae, and Rubiaceae
than other families and higher in roots and below-ground
collections than above-ground collections.

Disease relationships
Little to no research has been done that considers the issue
of treating related diseases with related plants. Some diseases in past studies may be connected such as different
types of infectious diseases like wound infections and
thrush, which may actually be caused by different taxa of
bacteria. If we look more deeply into the Western classification and causes of diseases [106], we realize that seemingly unrelated diseases may have the same underlying
cause and be treated in similar ways. For instance, it
would appear that eczema, diabetes, and asthma are very
different diseases, but they are all in fact auto-immune
syndromes – the body turning against and attacking itself,
in one case in the skin, another in the pancreas, and the
third in the respiratory system [107]. Once again, for the
proposed approach we need to be able to measure the
relatedness of the diseases, regardless of whether they are
due to genetic, infectious, or environmental causes.
The relatedness of two diseases is perhaps the hardest of
the three relatedness measures to delineate, as diseases did
not all evolve from a common ancestor and therefore are
not linked by a phylogeny as cultures and plants are. We
can say that two different bacterial infections are closely
related, but how can we say how closely a bacterial infec-

(page number not for citation purposes)

Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2007, 3:36

tion and sickle cell anemia are related? One is caused by
an invading organism and the other by genetics.
Exacerbating this problem is the fact that Western doctors
classify diseases mainly by the body system affected, such
as cardiovascular, brain, or bone diseases, because doctors
use the symptoms within these body systems to diagnoses
diseases [106]. Some diseases are grouped together by
their causes, such as autoimmune diseases, but as diseases
are treated more often for their symptoms than for their
underlying causes, this is usually not the case. One
approach to linking diseases with their different base
causes is to look for patterns in the existing medicinal
plants that are laboratory-proven to effectively treat different diseases in order to reveal the related mechanisms of
causation and treatment of diseases, avoiding plants that
are part of the main database being analyzed so as not to
be tautological. Specht [108,109] has done this type of
analysis using cladistic computer programs using the parsimony algorithm to determine how plant families are
related by the diseases they are used to treat (a method
that could be termed pathotaxonomy, analogous to
chemotaxonomy), and how diseases are related by the
plant families used to treat them (which we will call
"plant-based disease taxonomy" or PBDT).
There is some evidence of similar diseases being treated
with closely related plants, as Lukhoda, Simmonds et al.
[110] have shown by looking at the problem pathotaxonomically that similar disease-treating characters group
together on a phylogeny of Plectranthus species [Lamiaceae]. Senchina et al. [111] performed a similar phenetic
analysis of several Echinacea species [Asteraceae], showing
that some of the immunomodulatory characteristics of
the species align with one interpretation of Echinacea's
phylogenetic clades if both immune boosting and
immune suppressing characteristics are taken into
account, showing that we must look at not just one but
rather many medicinal actions to see a correlation with
the plant phylogenies, and to be able to use the plant phylogenies as an indication of a shared disease treatment
mechanism or vice versa. Daly and Stevenson [112] have
extended the PBDT method to grouping diseases by the
plant species used to treat them. In this case, if a subset of
the same plants is used to treat the same diseases, the diseases are more likely to be caused by a similar metabolic
system in the human body that is being affected therapeutically in similar ways by these similar plants. This technique uses algorithms borrowed from plant taxonomy to
find patterns of related diseases where diseases are treated
by the same plant. For instance, in Guatemala, the Neotropical herb tres puntas (Neurolaena lobata (L.) Cass.
[Asteraceae]) is used there (personal observation, 2000)
and shown in the laboratory to treat malaria, diabetes,
and dengue fever [113-116]. Therefore, under the shared-

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/3/1/36

plant-treatments technique, these three diseases would be
considered to have some relation, depending on other
plants also used to treat these diseases.
In order to avoid circular reasoning while using the PBDT
method to find disease relatedness values, the plants in
the main study dataset should not be used to find disease
relations, but rather plants that have already been studied
in the laboratory and have been shown to be effective
against the diseases being studied. The NAPRALERT
(Pharmacological Sciences (PCRPS), College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois) and MEDLINE [117] databases are good sources on laboratory and clinically tested
medicinal plants for this technique. Using laboratoryproven medicinal plants to find these patterns could permit the creation of a broader disease taxonomy and estimate disease relatedness. If there is not a sufficient
number of laboratory-tested plants to link the diseases
being studied, the diseases analyzed would have to be limited to comparisons of groups of phylogenetically related
diseases, such as among the infectious Protista kingdom
parasite diseases (malaria, Chagas' disease, African sleeping sickness, and leishmaniasis). In fact, one good test of
the PBDT technique is to compare the relationships it
determines for the set of infectious Protista diseases to the
phylogenetic relationships determined by systematists for
the Protista species. If this comparison of the PBDT and
phylogenetic methods of determining disease relatedness
validates the PBDT method, it can be used to tie together
all the diseases, otherwise the analysis should be limited
to within the easily related disease classes.
A third option for determining disease relations is the relatively new genetic drug-disease connectivity map [118]
derived from the human genome project data that show
how diseases and pharmaceuticals that are used to treat
them affect similar genes. This would only work for the
diseases with a genetic basis or predisposition (uterine
fibroids, eczema, asthma, and diabetes in this study) and
a measure of relatedness would have to be derived from
the connectivity network. The relatedness values from this
system can again be compared to the relatedness values
derived from the PBDT as a way to validate and calibrate
this method.

Cultural relationships
To determine cultural relatedness, it has been suggested to
simply look at geographic distance between the two cultures, but this is problematic as geographic barriers such
as mountains and oceans that slow the transmission of
cultural knowledge are hard to factor in. Are the indigenous groups of southern Argentina and Chile really as
similar to those of South Africa, at 7,100 km distance, as
they are to the people of Costa Rica, also 7,100 km away?
These cultural barriers are not very easy to quantify.

Alternatively, evolutionary language trees could be considered, as they are a fairly complete record of the intermingling of different cultures and passing of information
such as herbal remedies. Glottochronology is a technique
that can be used to date language phylogenies using common words between languages, called cognates [119], but
glottochronology is not considered valid past 5,000 years
ago for native North American languages [120] and not
past 6,000 years ago for Indo-European languages [121],
including English and Hindi. This means that glottochronology would not work for the distant cultures of
Peru and Mali being considered.
Cultural phylogenies have been developed based on multiple genetic comparisons that are probably valid past earlier dates. These genetic phylogenies match quite closely
with language phylogenies and actually may be a better
indicator of cultural knowledge transmission than language phylogenies as languages can hybridize quite rapidly, e.g., creoles and pidgins [119]. Given that these
genetic cultural phylogenies are dated, they will be used to
calculate cultural relatedness by using a metric such as 1/
time to the most recent common ancestor of the two cultures. This genetic cultural-relatedness method appears to
be much more viable for the distantly related cultures
under study than glottochronology, and is currently being
updated with National Geographic's Genographic project
[122,123] which should cover the Asháninka and Malinké
groups that are part of this study that Cavalli-Sforza has
not.

Discussion
In the end, the best data on relationships will come from
a combination of metabolite fingerprinting and dated
phylogenies like "Deep Time" for plants; disease descriptions, relations, and shared-plant treatments for diseases;
and genetic phylogenies for cultures. Advances in these
techniques will likely come up that can be integrated as
well as the following extensions of relations of plant parts
used, using existing databases, model validation and prediction. It should be pointed out that some measures of
relatedness will be more accurate than others, and only
some of these potential measures, out of a realm of many
possibilities, are described here. However, the equations
that synthesize these relations into measures of potential
medicinal efficacy of each plant should function regardless of how the relations are measured.
It may be possible to add additional factors for the relatedness of the plant part used (root, bark, wood, leaves,
flowers, fruit, seeds, or combinations thereof), extraction
method (decoction; alcohol, water, or oil tincture; infusion; entire plant), season harvested, companion plants,
and growth habit, to the above equations in order to
refine their accuracy if a suitable measure of these rela-

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/3/1/36

tions could be determined. There is no immediately obvious metric, for instance, of how the different compounds
found in the roots vs. the leaves of different species might
be related, analogous to the relatively simple metrics of
the phylogenetic distances for species, culture, and diseases. Unless many different plant parts from unrelated
species can be tested for efficacy to derive some measure
of the average relatedness between the compounds in
leaves and roots, for instance, it may be difficult to include
factors such as this in the calculations.
Any published ethnobotany study or database can be integrated into the data to broaden the coverage and increase
the accuracy of the data. For instance, the United States
Department of Agriculture's phytochemistry and ethnobotany database [124], the Native American Ethnobotany
Database [125], and the culturally more similar International Ethnobotany Database [126] would allow different
cultures that have not been studied firsthand to be
included in the medicinal potential analysis, although different interview and research methodologies may cause
problems in a unified analysis of these databases.
Once data on a sufficient number of medicinal plant species, diverse cultures, and related diseases has been collected, the manner that the three factors of plant, disease,
and cultural relatedness interact in the mathematical
model can be assessed. The formulas presented above are
ad hoc and therefore need to be validated or modified.
This can be done by performing a consistent evaluation of
each plant species' medical efficacy, via either bioassays or
literature searches, and seeing how the efficacy correlates
with the relatedness of the plants, diseases, and cultures.
Existing studies have tried to make a standard measure of
efficacy by grading previous lab or clinical studies on
plants from the literature as "not effective", "effective", or
"highly effective," but of course, this always introduces
the grader's bias [3]. With possible access to one of the
large ethnobotanical databases such as those of Duke or
Moerman, a quick verification of the system could be performed using literature studies as a sort of verification, but
the vast differences in the way plants' medicinal efficacies
are tested in the existing literature makes this approach
problematic. Instead, a consistent set of efficacy studies on
the plants would give more reliable verification of the system. It would also be interesting as another form of validation to see how the index proposed here correlates with
other ethnobotanical indices such as informant consensus
values and relative importance as has been done with several existing indices [13,15].
Measuring efficacy across diseases can be difficult as, for
instance, one cannot reliably compare EC50 values from
an antimalarial assay to the EC50 values for a diabetes
assay. General disease-treating efficacy could be measured

Page 24 of 28
(page number not for citation purposes)

Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2007, 3:36

using bioassays such as the brine shrimp assay for bioactivity, which can be used across different diseases [3], but
this is inaccurate, as it only tests for certain types of biological activity that might occur in the human body.
Therefore, for validation purposes, bioassay tests should
be used for comparison of plant efficacy activity only
within one disease, and the efficacy test by literature
review such as Trotter and Logan's [3] should be used to
compare between different diseases. One way to adjust for
differences between diseases is to factor in the efficacy of
the dose a healer usually administers for particular disease, or calculate how this efficacy compares with the
effective dose of a proven standard pharmaceutical, i.e.
how close does the dose of a plant given traditionally
come to an effective dose.
Prediction of unexplored but effective medicinal plants
will be possible, perhaps for the first time in this field, as
the potential of any plant in a dated phylogeny can be calculated, not only those that are actually used in treatments. Plant species with no reported medicinal use can
easily be plugged into the quantitative system based on
their relations to other plants with known uses, producing
a measure of the medicinal potential for the unreported
plant that may be within the range of potentials for
reported plants. If these plants are in the top of the range
of computed potentials, they should be considered for
laboratory analysis for true efficacy and they may turn out
to be just as effective if not more so than reported plants.

Conclusion
A preliminary quantitative cross-cultural analysis of Peruvian and Malian medicinal plants has shown that some of
the prerequisite hypotheses of shared plant remedies are
true, but a more refined analysis is necessary. A new theoretical mathematical methodology of "relational efficacy"
has been introduced that ethnobotanical researchers can
use to estimate the potential of the plants they have studied before the plants have been fully analyzed in a laboratory. Once this system is validated, it should also allow
effective comparison between studies by looking at the
difference in the overall potential of all the medicinal
plants in each study or the potential of particular species
between studies. Thus, this system will be able to synthesize many cultures' medicinal plant knowledge to pinpoint plants with a high potential for being medically
effective, save limited laboratory time and resources, and
predict species that may have great disease-treating potential that have never before been considered in any culture.
