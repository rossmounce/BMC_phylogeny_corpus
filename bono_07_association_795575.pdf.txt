Abstract
Background: Emerging molecular, animal model and epidemiologic evidence suggests that Shigatoxigenic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (STEC O157) isolates vary in their capacity to cause human
infection and disease. The translocated intimin receptor (tir) and intimin (eae) are virulence factors
and bacterial receptor-ligand proteins responsible for tight STEC O157 adherence to intestinal
epithelial cells. They represent logical genomic targets to investigate the role of sequence variation
in STEC O157 pathogenesis and molecular epidemiology. The purposes of this study were (1) to
identify tir and eae polymorphisms in diverse STEC O157 isolates derived from clinically ill humans
and healthy cattle (the dominant zoonotic reservoir) and (2) to test any observed tir and eae
polymorphisms for association with human (vs bovine) isolate source.
Results: Five polymorphisms were identified in a 1,627-bp segment of tir. Alleles of two tir
polymorphisms, tir 255 T>A and repeat region 1-repeat unit 3 (RR1-RU3, presence or absence)
had dissimilar distributions among human and bovine isolates. More than 99% of 108 human isolates
possessed the tir 255 T>A T allele and lacked RR1-RU3. In contrast, the tir 255 T>A T allele and
RR1-RU3 absence were found in 55% and 57%, respectively, of 77 bovine isolates. Both
polymorphisms associated strongly with isolate source (p < 0.0001), but not by pulsed field gel
electrophoresis type or by stx1 and stx2 status (as determined by PCR). Two eae polymorphisms
were identified in a 2,755-bp segment of 44 human and bovine isolates; 42 isolates had identical eae
sequences. The eae polymorphisms did not associate with isolate source.
Conclusion: Polymorphisms in tir but not eae predict the propensity of STEC O157 isolates to
cause human clinical disease. The over-representation of the tir 255 T>A T allele in human-derived
isolates vs the tir 255 T>A A allele suggests that these isolates have a higher propensity to cause
disease. The high frequency of bovine isolates with the A allele suggests a possible bovine ecological
niche for this STEC O157 subset.

Background
Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (STEC O157) is
the major STEC serotype associated with human infection
in the U.S. [1]. Cattle are the predominant North American reservoir of this zoonotic pathogen [2,3] and contact
with infected livestock and ingestion of contaminated
meat are frequent routes of human infection [4-7]. Other
sources of STEC O157 infection are contaminated fruits,
vegetables and water [8-10] and person-to-person contact
[11,12]. From 1982–2002, there were 350 STEC O157
outbreaks reported in the U.S., resulting in 8,500 clinical
cases, 1,500 hospitalizations and 40 deaths [13]. Human
STEC O157 infections cause mild self-limiting diarrhea to
severe disease including hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) [14,15]. HUS, due to STEC
O157 infection, is the leading cause of renal failure for
children under the age of five years [1].
As with many infectious disease agents, STEC O157
strains appear to vary in their capacity to cause human
infection and disease. For example, in the gnotobiotic pig
challenge model, STEC O157 strains differ in both the
clinical course they provoke and the histopathological
lesions they induce [16]. Epidemiologic surveillance data
in the U.S. also supports the idea of inter-strain variation
in STEC O157 virulence. The annual U.S. incidence of
clinical STEC O157 infections is estimated at 1.1 per
100,000 persons [1]. However, pooled data from five
North American serological surveys found 11% of 2,251
healthy children and adults (11,000 per 100,000 persons)
with serologic evidence of E. coli O157 exposure and/or
subclinical infection [17-21]. On a smaller scale, the
investigation of a recent STEC O157 outbreak linked with
visiting an agricultural fair suggested that all STEC O157
are not equivalent in terms of their public health risk [22].
At least 25 people out of over 170,000 fair visitors who
attended over a two-week period became ill with an STEC
O157 isolate that shared the same pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern. The outbreak investigation
revealed that the fairground environment was heavily
contaminated with multiple STEC O157 isolates with
eight different PFGE patterns, including the outbreak
strain. The presumed high human STEC O157 exposure
but low human clinical disease incidence, suggested by
both the surveillance and outbreak data, could be partially explained if only a subset of STEC O157 isolates
present in the bovine (or other) zoonotic reservoirs were
pathogenic to humans. Identifying markers for virulent
strains as well as understanding the mechanisms responsible for disparities in virulence may provide new insights
into the epidemiology and control of STEC O157 infections in both human and animal reservoirs.
An important step in the pathogenesis of human infection
with STEC O157 is colonization of the lower gastrointes-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/7/98

tinal (GI) tract. STEC O157 have a number of virulence
and putative virulence factors which aid in this colonization including the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE),
production of Shiga toxin 2, flagellin, OmpA, Lpf and
ToxB [14,23-28]. The interaction of two LEE-encoded
genes, tir and eae, is responsible for the tight bacterial
adherence to host epithelial cells characteristic of STEC
O157 infections. The eae-encoded ligand protein intimin
is located on the bacterial outer membrane. The intimin
receptor protein Tir is translocated into the epithelial cell
by type III secretion and integrated in the host cell membrane [29,30]. Given the role of intimin and Tir in STEC
O157 pathogenesis and the well documented role of cattle as a zoonotic reservoir, the purpose of this study was to
characterize sequence variation in STEC O157 eae and tir
genes and to evaluate whether it associates with human or
bovine host origin.

Methods
Bacterial strains
For sequence discovery, 22 diverse STEC O157 isolates
were assembled that varied by source, either human clinical (n = 9) or bovine (n = 13) (Table 1). A further 101 epidemiologically unrelated human clinical and 64 bovine
isolates were included to estimate tir polymorphism allele
frequencies. Each isolate was characterized by ELISA using
anti-O157 and H7 monoclonal antibodies and multiplex
PCR for stx1, stx2, eae, hlyA, rfbO157 and fliCH7 [31-34]. For
the purpose of this study, isolates were defined as STEC
O157 if they were E. coli O157 antigen positive by ELISA,
rfbEO157 and fliCH7-positive by PCR, and stx1 and/or stx2
positive by PCR.
PCR amplification, DNA sequencing and analysis
A 2,755-kb segment of the eae gene and 1,627-kb segment
of the tir gene were amplified and sequenced using primers listed in Table 2. The amplification reactions contained 0.5 ng of DNA, 0.75 uM of each primer, 200 uM of
each dNTP, 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 1 U of Platinum Taq DNA
polymerase (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) in a
55 ul reaction. PCR amplifications were performed using
a PTC-200 (MJ Research, Waterton, MA) at the following
conditions: 1 min at 95°C followed by 30 sec at 96°C, 30
sec at 52°C and 2 min at 72°C for 35 cycles and finally
72°C for 7 min for 1 cycle.

PCR products were purified and concentrated using the
QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia,
CA). DNA sequencing reactions were prepared using the
ABI PRISM BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ready
reaction kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with
slight modifications of the manufacturer's protocol to
reduce the final volume to 10 ul. The sequencing reactions
were cycled with a PTC-200 (MJ Research) at the following conditions: 1 min at 96°C followed by 30 sec at 96°C,

1 min at 50°C and 4 min at 60°C for 30 cycles. DNA
sequences were determined with either an ABI PRISM
3700 DNA analyzer or an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer
(PE Applied Biosystems).
Nucleotide sequences were analyzed using SeqMan and
alignments were constructed using Clustal X, both from
the Lasergene software package (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI). A consensus parsimony tree was generated in
PHYLIP (version 3.65) from tir DNA sequences using the
program PARS [35] and viewed in TreeView (version
1.6.6) [36].
Pulse field gel electrophoresis of isolates used for
genotyping
PFGE was performed on all human and bovine derived E.
coli O157:H7 isolates by using the PulseNet protocol and
the restriction endonuclease XbaI [37]. Restriction frag-

ment patterns were analyzed using Bionumerics version 4
(Applied Maths, Belgium).
Statistical analysis of tir variation and host association
The frequencies of each identified tir nucleotide or repeat
polymorphism and tir genotype were compared between
STEC O157 isolates of human and bovine origin. The data
were analyzed as an unmatched case-control study by
exact logistic regression using the LOGISTIC procedure of
SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). The binary
response variable (outcome) of interest was the probability of the strain being of bovine origin (case) vs human
origin (control). Each tir polymorphism and genotype
was converted into a categorical explanatory (predictor)
variable, where each possible variant within a given polymorphism was coded separately. Genotype 10 and the
most common variant for each polymorphism were used
as reference conditions. The association of each tir poly-

morphism variant with the likelihood of being a case
STEC O157 strain was examined by generating univariate
exact odds ratios (OR) with exact 95% confidence intervals (CI) and corresponding p values. Stx profiles of isolates defined by PCR were also examined for association
with human or bovine strain origin.

Results
Polymorphisms in STEC O157 tir and eae
Five polymorphic loci were identified in a 1,627-kb segment of the STEC O157 tir gene [GenBank:DQ458771].
One was a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), 255
T>A (reference sequence is GenBank accession number
BA000007 gene ECs4561). The minor allele of this nonsynonymous polymorphism encodes aspartic acid while
the other encodes glutamic acid. Four were repeat polymorphisms with the following properties: repeat region 1
(RR1, nucleotide position 573 in reference sequence
BAB37984) containing up to four imperfect 18-bp repeat
units (RU1-RU4), RR2 (nucleotide position 963) containing [ACA]n where n = 3 or 4, RR3 (nucleotide position
1,080) containing [ACT]n where n = 2 or 3 and RR4
(nucleotide position 1,179) containing [ACAACT]n where
n = 2, 3 or 4 (Figure 1A). In one isolate, a chimeric repeat

within RR1 was identified consisting of approximately the
5' half of RU2 and the 3' half of RU4 (Figure 1B).
The five polymorphic tir loci defined ten unique tir genotypes (Figure 1B). Two genotypes, 4 and 7, accounted for
83% (n = 185) of the isolates sequenced, while four genotypes were observed in only one isolate each (Figure 1B).
A consensus parsimony tree generated from these genotypes defined two major clades (Figure 1B). Alleles of tir
255 T>A and RR1-RU3 were responsible for discrimination between these clades (Figure 1B). Alleles of these two
polymorphisms are strongly correlated.
The sequence of a 2,755-bp region of the eae gene was
identical in 42 of 44 STEC O157 isolates representing at
least one isolate from each tir genotype [GenBank:EF540940]. Synonymous (eae 60 G>A reference
sequence is GenBank accession number BA000007 gene
ECs4559) and non-synonymous (eae 2414 C>T) SNPs
were identified, each in isolates 2857\98 [GenBank:EF540939] and ATCC 43890 [GenBank:EF540941],
respectively. The eae 2414 C>T results in a change from a
threonine to an isoleucine (T805I). This isolate also contained tir genotype 7, the most common tir genotype.

Physical maps and taxonomical relationships of the tir gene
Physical maps and taxonomical relationships of the tir gene. (A) A physical map of the tir gene from STEC O157 (GenBank accession number BA000007 gene ECs4561). A 1.6-kb region of the tir gene was sequenced from 22 STEC O157 isolates
and the polymorphisms mapped on the tir gene along with previously identified functional domains. (B) Consensus tree from
seven equally parsimonious trees constructed in PHYLIP (version 3.65) [35] with the program PARS and viewed in TreeView
(version 1.6.6) [36]. The tree was generated from seven variable sites (255 T>A, RR1-RU2, RR1-RU3, RR1-RU4, RR2, RR3 and
RR4) and describes the taxonomical relationship of the tir nucleotide sequence with associated phenotypic and genotypic information. Ten genotypes resulting from one nucleotide polymorphism and four repeat region variations were identified from the
185 isolates. Colored boxes identify the different nucleotide variations and repeat units, while white boxes indicate missing
repeat units. The sequences of the repeat regions are located below the colored boxes with the top line as the consensus
sequence. A variant repeat unit (*) in repeat region 1 was identified that had the following sequence "AAAGGTGCTGGGGAGTTG".

Association of tir 255 T>A and RR1-RU3 alleles with host
origin of STEC O157 isolates
Unmatched case-control analysis showed that only tir 255
T>A and RR1-RU3 (presence or absence) alleles were significantly associated with host origin. Specifically, isolates
with tir 255 T>A A allele were 34.0 times more likely (5.7
to 1381.9 95% CI, p < 0.0001) to be of bovine than
human origin. Similarly, isolates with RR1-RU3 present
were 32.0 times more likely (5.3 to 1302.9 95% CI, p <
0.0001) to be of bovine than human origin. Because tir
255 T>A and RR1-RU3 alleles discriminate between genotypes 4 and 7, these genotypes also associate with host origin. Specifically, isolates with genotype 4 were 37.0 times
more likely to be of bovine than human origin (6.6 to ∞
95% CI, p < 0.0001), while those with genotype 7 were
2.9 times more likely to be of human than bovine origin

(2.0 to 4.5 95% CI, p < 0.0001). Genotyping of 255 T>A
on all study isolates reinforced this association, with 1 out
of 108 human isolates (0.93%, 0.02 to 5.1 95% CI), as
opposed to 34 out of 77 bovine isolates (44.2%, 32.8 to
55.9 95% CI), having an A at 255 T>A (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, stx1 and stx2 status (as determined by PCR)
were statistically independent of bovine or human
derived STEC O157 isolates (p = 0.12 and p = 0.37, respectively) and when all 185 STEC O157 isolates were compared by PFGE, there was no association of PFGE profiles
with tir 255 T>A alleles.

Discussion
STEC O157 tir 255 T>A T allele is significantly overrepresented in human isolates relative to isolates with the A
allele (99.1 vs. 0.9%, p < 0.0001). The reason for this host

difference in 255 T>A allele frequency is unknown. It is
possible that STEC O157 255 T>A A isolates are shed in
cattle feces for shorter periods of time or in lower numbers
than STEC O157 255 T>A T isolates, resulting in lower
probability of product or environmental contamination
and thus, lower human exposure and subsequent infection. Reduced human exposure could also occur if STEC
O157 255 T>A A isolates are less able to survive on meat,
on produce, in water or in other environmental sources of
human infection. STEC O157 255 T>A A isolates maybe
less virulent in humans so that they are less likely to cause
clinical illness prompting fecal culture. Whatever the
actual mechanism, the low 255 T>A A allele frequency in
human isolates cannot be explained by a corresponding
low frequency in the bovine reservoir.
Non-random distribution of E. coli O157:H7 subtypes
among bovine and human isolates have been reported in
previous investigations. Octamer-based genome scanning
classified STEC O157 into two lineages (I and II), with
human origin isolates biased towards lineage I [38]. Qgene allelic variation (upstream of the prophage stx
region), Shiga-toxin 2 production differences and Shiga
toxin-encoding bacteriophage insertion site-defined genotypes also had biased distributions of isolates from
bovine and human origin [39-41]. However, none of
these previously described methods provided as clear a
discrimination between human and bovine isolates as
those described in this study. Furthermore, the presence of
one or both stx1 and stx2 genes (as determined by PCR)
was statistically independent of an isolate's tir 255 T>A
allele or RU3 presence or absence. The high degree of discrimination provided by tir 255 T>A and the central role
of Tir in human infection points towards a possible functional role, rather than solely as a marker, for this polymorphism.
Previous studies indicate a paucity of nucleotide polymorphisms in most STEC O157 genes [42-44]. The presence
of five polymorphic loci with high minor allele frequency
within tir, therefore, appears to be atypical in STEC O157.
Furthermore, all five polymorphisms are non-synonymous. In contrast, only one low frequency synonymous
polymorphism was found in eae, suggesting that these two
loci are under different selective pressures. The association
of tir 255 T>A T allele with human infection argues that
host factors may impose some selection pressure on tir.
The fact that the tir 255 T>A A minor allele frequency is
over 30% in bovine isolates, where the frequency of
minor alleles for most SNPs in STEC O157 is considerably
less than that, also argues for some selection on this allele
or another locus tightly linked to 255 T>A [43,44].

O157 genomic sequences, EDL 933 and Sakai [45,46],
showed that their tir genes were both genotype 7. Our
sequencing of the tir gene from these two isolates confirmed this finding (data not shown for EDL 933). RR2,
RR3 and RR4 together were previously used as a marker
for high-resolution molecular typing of E. coli O157:H7
[47]. In the present study, the sequencing of a broad population of STEC O157 strains that included both human
clinical and bovine reservoir isolates revealed additional
informative tir polymorphisms, particularly the 255 T>A
A allele and the presence of RR1-RU3.
Two polymorphic tir loci, tir 255 T>A and RR1-RU3,
appear to have epidemiologic significance by their clear
and strong association with isolate host source. Both loci
are located near the amino terminus of Tir, a portion of
the molecule that is normally located in the host cytosol
during Tir-Intimin binding in host cell-bacterial adherence [48], in a region where no function has been
described. However, these loci may have functional significance based on the biased distribution of their alleles in
human derived isolates. One explanation for this could be
variation in avidity, kinetics or tropism of adherence to
epithelial cells, a major function of the Tir protein, from
isolates with the tir 255 T>A A allele compared to isolates
with the tir 255 T>A T allele. However, more investigation
will be necessary to delineate the structure-function relationships of these tir polymorphisms.

Conclusion
Many host, bacterial and environmental factors impact
whether or not infection results from human exposure to
STEC O157. This study demonstrates that genomic polymorphisms in tir but not eae predict the likelihood that
STEC O157 strains can cause human disease. Intriguing
but unexplained findings include the host bias in tir allele
frequency between human and bovine hosts. The overrepresentation of the tir 255 T>A T allele in humanderived isolates – vs the A allele proves its merit as a
marker for virulence in humans. Also of interest is the
high degree of tir sequence variation relative to that found
in eae, even though the two proteins encoded by these
genes interact together as receptor and ligand during
adherence to host intestinal epithelial cells. Further
research will be necessary to determine if the tir 255 T>A
and RR1-RU3 polymorphisms are simply markers of
strain virulence or are functional components of hostpathogen interactions.
