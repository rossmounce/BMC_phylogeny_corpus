Combined analysis of transcriptome and
metabolite data reveals extensive differences
between black and brown nearly-isogenic
soybean (Glycine max) seed coats enabling the
identification of pigment isogenes

Abstract
Background: The R locus controls the color of pigmented soybean (Glycine max) seeds. However information
about its control over seed coat biochemistry and gene expressions remains limited. The seed coats of nearlyisogenic black (iRT) and brown (irT) soybean (Glycine max) were known to differ by the presence or absence of
anthocyanins, respectively, with genes for only a single enzyme (anthocyanidin synthase) found to be differentially
expressed between isolines. We recently identified and characterized a UDP-glycose:flavonoid-3-Oglycosyltransferase (UGT78K1) from the seed coat of black (iRT) soybean with the aim to engineer seed coat color
by suppression of an anthocyanin-specific gene. However, it remained to be investigated whether UGT78K1 was
overexpressed with anthocyanin biosynthesis in the black (iRT) seed coat compared to the nearly-isogenic brown
(irT) tissue.
In this study, we performed a combined analysis of transcriptome and metabolite data to elucidate the control of
the R locus over seed coat biochemistry and to identify pigment biosynthesis genes. Two differentially expressed
late-stage anthocyanin biosynthesis isogenes were further characterized, as they may serve as useful targets for the
manipulation of soybean grain color while minimizing the potential for unintended effects on the plant system.
Results: Metabolite composition differences were found to not be limited to anthocyanins, with specific
proanthocyanidins, isoflavones, and phenylpropanoids present exclusively in the black (iRT) or the brown (irT) seed
coat. A global analysis of gene expressions identified UGT78K1 and 19 other anthocyanin, (iso)flavonoid, and
phenylpropanoid isogenes to be differentially expressed between isolines. A combined analysis of metabolite and
gene expression data enabled the assignment of putative functions to biosynthesis and transport isogenes. The
recombinant enzymes of two genes were validated to catalyze late-stage steps in anthocyanin biosynthesis in vitro
and expression profiles of the corresponding genes were shown to parallel anthocyanin biosynthesis during black
(iRT) seed coat development.
Conclusion: Metabolite composition and gene expression differences between black (iRT) and brown (irT) seed
coats are far more extensive than previously thought. Putative anthocyanin, proanthocyanidin, (iso)flavonoid, and
phenylpropanoid isogenes were differentially-expressed between black (iRT) and brown (irT) seed coats, and
UGT78K2 and OMT5 were validated to code UDP-glycose:flavonoid-3-O-glycosyltransferase and anthocyanin 3’-Omethyltransferase proteins in vitro, respectively. Duplicate gene copies for several enzymes were overexpressed in

the black (iRT) seed coat suggesting more than one isogene may have to be silenced to engineer seed coat color
using RNA interference.

Background
Flavonoids represent a class of plant secondary metabolites that have evolved a variety of physiological functions including pigmentation, pathogen defense, and UV
protection [1]. Additionally, metabolic engineering of
flavonoids has become an important target for plant biotechnology, as flavonoids provide health benefits to
foods, favorable agronomic traits to crops, and may be
used in the future to color commercial transgenic materials such as grains to facilitate their identification and
monitoring [2-4].
Commercial soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) has a
yellow grain. However rare spontaneous mutants exist
that have black (iRT) or brown (irT) seed coat (testa)
color phenotypes. Black (iRT) and brown (irT) soybean
seed coats contain proanthocyanidins (PAs, a.k.a. condensed tannins) but differ in the presence/absence of
anthocyanins [5]. A goal for biosafety is to engineer a
novel red seed coat color as a marker for transgenic soybean grains to facilitate their identification [4], and
could potentially be achieved by the suppression of
anthocyanin-specific genes that are overexpressed in the
black soybean seed coat. However the genes have not
yet been identified.
Six genetic loci (I, R, T, Wp, W1, and O) [6] identified
by classical genetics control flavonoid-based seed coat
color in soybean. The I locus controls the presence or
absence and spatial distribution of flavonoid pigments
and has four alleles (I, Ii, Ik, i); I gives completely nonpigmented seed coat, Ii restricts pigment to the hilum
and I k to a saddle-shaped region, whereas the i allele
results in a fully pigmented seed coat [6]. The recessive
i allele results from spontaneous deletion of CHS4 or
CHS1 promoter sequences and results in the abolishment of a posttranscriptional RNA silencing mechanism
that results in the increased accumulation of chalcone
synthase (CHS) transcripts in the seed coat [7,8].
The T locus is a pleoiotropic locus that controls the
type and abundance of flavonoid pigments in the seed
coat in addition to other traits such as seed coat cracking and trichome pigmentation [5,9,10]. Genetic polymorphisms that affect the expression or function of the
flavonoid 3’-hydroxylase gene (F3’H1) have been shown
to co-segregate with recessive t alleles [11,12].
The W1 locus controls flower color and affects seed
color only in an iRt background; where W1 and w1
alleles give imperfect black and buff seed coat colors,
respectively [6]. The W1 allele for purple flower color
was shown to code flavonoid 3’,5’-hydroxylase (F3’5’H),

as a 65-bp insertion in the gene (F3’5’H) co-segregated
with white flower color (w1) [13].
The Wp locus was suggested to code the flavonone 3hydroxylase gene (F3H1) by microarray analysis as high
levels of F3H1 transcripts co-segregated with purple
flower color (Wp), and low levels with pink (wp) flowers
[14]. In the seed coat, recessive wp resulted in a change
from black (iRTWp) to a lighter grayish (iRTwp) color
[14].
The O locus affects the color of brown (irTO) seed
coats, with the recessive o allele giving a red-brown
(irTo) phenotype [6]. The O locus has been suggested to
code the proanthocyanidin (PA, a.k.a. condensed tannin)
biosynthesis gene anthocyanidin reductase (ANR), as the
gene was located between markers that flank the O
locus on the soybean physical map [15]. However molecular genetics analyses have not yet demonstrated the
identity of the O locus gene.
Finally, the R locus controls the presence (R) or
absence (r) of anthocyanins in black (iRT) or brown
(irT) seed coats, respectively [16]. Despite the identification of several pigment genes from soybean, only transcripts for anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) genes (ANS231, ANS27-1 and ANS100) have been shown to be overexpressed in the black (iRT) seed coat compared to the
brown (irT) nearly-isogenic line by northern blot [17].
The upregulation of several ANS genes suggests the R
locus to code a regulatory factor, and raises the possibility that other isogenes for anthocyanin biosynthesis
may be upregulated.
Recently, a cDNA coding the UDP-glycose:flavonoid3-O-glycosyltransferase (UF3GT) gene (UGT78K1) was
isolated from the black (iRT) seed coat and shown to
function in anthocyanin biosynthesis in vitro and by
complementation of a gene mutation in Arabidopsis
[18]. However UGT78K1 expressions have not been
investigated in relation to seed coat color.
The soybean genome sequence Glyma1 was predicted
to code 46,430 protein-coding genes with nearly 75% of
the genes present in multiple copies [19]. This may suggest a relatively high frequency of functional redundancy
and increased difficulty in identifying soybean genes by
traditional approaches. However, using transcriptome
analysis tools such as the Soybean GeneChip equipped
with 37,500 probe sets in combination with broad-coverage metabolite analysis methodologies such as LCMS/MS, gene functions could potentially be efficiently
predicted. The combined analysis of transcriptome and
metabolite data has been shown to be a powerful

Results
qRT-PCR indicates differential expressions of anthocyanin
and proanthocyanidin genes in nearly-isogenic black (iRT)
and brown (irT) soybean seed coats

Among the flavonoid genes identified from soybean seed
coats, only ANS transcripts were found to be overexpressed in the seed coat of black (iRT) soybean compared to the brown (irT) isoline, however no RFLP
difference was observed when probing ANS genes [17].
This suggests that ANS overexpression is not the only
molecular difference between black (iRT) and brown
(irT) seed coats. To examine whether other anthocyanin
genes are upregulated, transcript profiles of the recently
identified UGT78K1 [18] and the DFR1 gene [GenBank:
AF167556] were measured from seed coat cDNA by
quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) using ANS2/ANS3
transcripts [GenBank:AY382829/GenBank: AY382830]
as a positive control. Phosphenol pyruvate carboxylase
(PEPC) [GenBank: D10717] was used as an endogenous
reference for normalization of the qRT-PCR measurements of target genes across seed coat samples, as PEPC
is expressed at similar levels in a wide range of soybean
tissues and has been used previously as a reference for
gene expressions during soybean seed coat development
[8,24].
qRT-PCR demonstrated UGT78K1 to be significantly
overexpressed in the black (iRT) seed coat at the transition stage (300 mg - 400 mg FSW) and early maturation
stage (400 - 500 mg FSW) of seed development compared to the brown (irT) isoline, and to be almost

undetectable at earlier stages (Figure 1). Stereomicroscopy and photospectroscopic measurements confirmed
these developmental stages to coincide with the stages
of anthocyanin biosynthesis in the black (irT) seed coat

approach for the functional identification of unknown
genes [20-22]. Metabolite differences caused by the
overexpression of a transcription factor, the exposure to
a nutritional stress, and by species differences have been
correlated with differences in transcriptome profiles to
successfully predict the functions of unknown genes in
flavonoid, glucosinolate, and alkaloid biosyntheses
[21-23].
In the present study we have employed targeted and
non-targeted metabolite analysis methodologies and
have demonstrated that black (iRT) and brown (irT)
nearly-isogenic soybean seed coats do not just differ in
the presence/absence of anthocyanins, and have extensive differences in procyanidin, (iso)flavonoid and phenylpropanoid compositions. The underlying differences
in gene expressions were then identified by microarray
analysis, and the putative functions of 20 unknown
genes were assigned by comparison to metabolite data.
From the set of differentially regulated genes, two putative late-stage anthocyanin genes were selected and the
functions of their coded enzymes were validated in vitro.
In addition, a set of gene candidates potentially coded
by the R locus have been provided.

(Figure 2). In contrast to UGT78K1, DFR1 was not differentially expressed at the stages of anthocyanin biosynthesis (Figure 1). ANS2/ANS3 mRNAs were
confirmed to be overexpressed in the black (iRT) seed
coat at most stages (Figure 1) as shown previously [17].
The seed coat palisade cells of black (iRT) soybean are
unusual compared to those of other model plants used
for the study of anthocyanin biosynthesis (e.g. Arabidopsis, Maize, and Petunia) because black (iRT) soybean
palisade cells synthesize both anthocyanins and
proanthocyanidins (PAs). ANR and LAR enzymes have
been identified to catalyze the conversion of cyanidin to
epicatechin and leucocyanidin to catechin, respectively,
which are the putative initial biochemical steps of PA
biosynthesis [25,26]. To investigate how a seed tissue
may coordinate the biosynthesis of these parallel pigment pathways, the expressions of putative PA genes
ANR1 [GenBank:JF433915] and LAR1 [GenBank:
JF433916] were examined in relation to anthocyanin
gene expressions. qRT-PCR demonstrated ANR1 expressions to decrease throughout seed coat development in
both genotypes and to be almost undetectable by the
stages of UGT78K1 overexpressions and anthocyanin
biosynthesis (Figure 1). By contrast, LAR1 expressions
were downregulated at the stages of anthocyanin biosynthesis in the black (iRT) seed coat (Figure 1).

No anthocyanin absorbance was measured from brown (irT) seed

In conclusion, these results show that the recently
identified UGT78K1 is upregulated in the black (iRT)
seed coat, in addition to ANS2/ANS3, and that there is a
simultaneous downregulation of the PA gene LAR1 at
the stages of anthocyanin biosynthesis. These results
demonstrate that expression differences between black
(iRT) and brown (irT) seed coats are not limited to
anthocyanin genes, and may suggest extensive differences in gene expressions and phenolic compositions.
Combined analysis of targeted and non-targeted
methodologies indicate overaccumulation of
anthocyanins, altered procyanidin, and reduced flavonol,
benzoic acid, and isoflavone compositions in the seed
coat of black (iRT) soybean

The structures of anthocyanins from only a few (Korean) black soybean varieties have been described [27,28]
and information regarding other phenolic compositions
may be limited to proanthocyanidins (PAs), where acidcatalyzed hydrolysis of black (iRT) and brown (irT) seed
coats showed the PAs to be 3’,4’-hydroxylated [5]. A
more extensive analysis of phenolic composition differences between black (iRT) and brown (irT) seed coats
could greatly improve our understanding of seed pigmentation, and may suggest gene activities that function
in pigment biosynthesis. For these reasons, black (iRT)
and brown (irT) Clark seed coat metabolites were
extracted at the transition stage (300 mg - 400 mg
FSW) of seed development with multiple solvents and
analyzed by targeted high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) and non-targeted HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/
MS). To ensure seed coats were at the same stage of
development, the days post anthesis, pod length, pod
color, embryo morphology, and transcript levels of the
developmental marker gene Gm-r1083-1191, a putative
cutin biosynthesis gene [29], and the metabolism gene
DFR1 were ensured to be equivalent between black
(iRT) and brown (irT) tissues (Additional file 1: Table
S1).
For a targeted analysis of anthocyanins, black (iRT)
and brown (irT) Clark seed coats were extracted with
acidified aqueous methanol and metabolites were identified using HPLC-DAD by measuring the absorbance at
520 nm in comparison to authentic standards. Ten cyanic pigments were identified, the most abundant were
the anthocyanins cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (peak 5, 43.6%
total peak area), cyanidin-3-O-galactoside (peak 4, 17.4%
peak area) and petunidin-3-O-glucoside (peak 6, 14.6%
total peak area) with lesser amounts of delphinidin-,
pelargonidin-, and peonidin-3-O-glucosides (peaks 3, 7,
8; 8.9%, 1.2%, and 1.1% peak areas, respectively), the
aglycone cyanidin (peak 9, 3.9% peak area), the 3-deoxyanthocyanidin diosmetinidin (peak 10, 2.0% peak area),

Kovinich et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:381

and the two unidentified anthocyanin-like compounds
(peaks 1 and 2, 1.6% and 0.8% peak areas, respectively)
(Table 1). To our knowledge this is the first report of a
3-deoxyanthocyanidin from the soybean seed coat. The
structures of all identified anthocyanins are represented
in Figure 3. By contrast, cyanic pigments were not
detected from the brown (irT) seed coat at any stage of
seed development (not shown).
To compare the structural features of PAs, black (iRT)
and brown (irT) seed coats were extracted with 70% acetone and subjected to phloroglucinol cleavage analysis
[30,31]. PA free monomers, polymer subunit compositions, and mean degree of polymerization (mDP) did not
differ significantly between nearly-isogenic black (iRT)
and brown (irT) seed coats. The soluble PA mDP was 4,
and the subunit and monomer compositions consisted
mainly of epicatechin with minor amounts of unidentified compounds (Additional file 2: Figure S1A - S1C).
Reaction with DMACA reagent demonstrated similar
amounts of soluble PAs from both black (iRT) and
brown (irT) seed coats (P = 0.08) (Additional file 2: Figure S1F). Further extraction of seed coat residues at 50°C
in the presence of acid and phloroglucinol yielded only
low levels of epicatechin-phloroglucinol adduct, epicatechin terminal units, and several unidentified compounds
(Additional file 2: Figure S1B), and acid catalyzed cleavage of seed coat residues at 95°C identified relatively
high, but equivalent amounts of 3’,4’-hydroxylated solvent insoluble PAs (Additional file 2: Figure S1E).
For a non-targeted analysis of soluble phenolic metabolites, nearly isogenic black (iRT) and brown (irT)
Clark seed coats were extracted with acidified aqueous
methanol and analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS over a mass
range of 100 amu to 1000 amu. Identities were assigned
to peaks by comparison of retention times and mass
fragmentation patterns to authentic standards. Peaks
with no corresponding authentic standards were identified by mass fragmentation patterns in comparison to

peaks identified by HPLC-DAD (see Table 1).

the literature. A total of 177 peaks were detected, of
which 78 peaks were assigned to 37 compounds (Table
2). Twenty-eight compounds were detected from the
black (iRT) seed coat (Table 2); consisting mainly of
unidentified compounds (35.7%) and anthocyanins
(32.1%), followed by procyanidins (25.0%). By contrast,
23 compounds were detected from the brown (irT) seed
coat (Table 2); consisting mainly of unidentified compounds (56.5%), followed by flavonols (13.0%) and procyanidins (13.0%). The majority of compounds (62.2% of
all compounds identified by HPLC-MS/MS) were exclusive to the black (iRT) or brown (irT) seed coat, suggesting extensively different biochemical specializations of
these tissues. The distribution of compound classes
from black (iRT) and brown (irT) Clark seed coats is
illustrated in Figure 4.
The 14 compounds exclusive to the black (iRT) seed
coat were anthocyanins (8 compounds), procyanidins (4
compounds), and unknown compounds (2 compounds)
(Table 2). HPLC-MS/MS (Table 2) confirmed the identity of anthocyanins found by HPLC-DAD (Table 1).
Procyanidin tetramers and larger oligomers were not
detected as they exceeded the mass range (1000 amu)
analyzed by the HPLC-MS/MS experiments, however 3
PA trimers (Procyanidin trimer 1, 2, and 4) and the Atype procyanidin dimer were exclusive to the black
(iRT) seed coat (Table 2).
The 9 compounds exclusive to the brown (irT) seed
coat consisted of 4 unknown compounds (Unknown
compound 2, 10, 12, and 13), 2 flavonols (Unknown flavonol 1 and 2), 2 benzoic acids (Orcinol O-hexoside and
Unknown benzoic acid 1), and the isoflavone daidzein
O-hexoside malonylated (Table 2).
Taken together, our metabolite analysis experiments
show that nearly-isogenic black (iRT) and brown (irT)
Clark seed coats have compositional differences not limited to the presence or absence of anthocyanins; with
specific flavonol, isoflavone, and benzoic acids exclusive
to the brown (irT) seed coat and anthocyanins and
unique procyanidin oligomers exclusive to the black
(iRT) seed coat. These results may suggest extensive differences in the underlying gene expressions.

Microarray Analysis Indicates Concomitant Upregulation
of Specific Phenylpropanoid, Flavonoid, and Anthocyanin
Isogenes and Downregulation of Other Flavonoid,
Benzoic Acid, and Isoflavone Isogenes in the Black (iRT)
Seed Coat Transcriptome

Nearly 75% of genes in the soybean genome are present
in multiple copies [19], and previously only transcripts
for ANS isogenes were found to be overexpressed in the
black (iRT) seed coat compared to the nearly-isogenic
brown (irT) tissue [17]. For a global analysis of isogene

expressions, black (iRT) and brown (irT) Clark seed
coats were dissected at the transition stage of seed
development (300 - 400 mg FSW) for microarray analysis using the Affymetrix Soybean GeneChip. Seed coats
were ensured to be at the same stage of development as
described above for the metabolite analyses (Additional
file 1: Table S1).
Of the 37,500 probe sets present on the Soybean GeneChip, 80 were found to be upregulated more than 2fold in black (iRT) soybean (Additional file 3: Table S2).

Classification using the Gene-Bins ontology tool (http://
bioinfoserver.rsbs.anu.edu.au/utils/GeneBins/index.php)
demonstrated the majority of upregulated genes to be
“unclassified without homology” (28.7%) or “unclassified

with homology” (24.8%), followed by “biosynthesis of
secondary metabolites” (7.9%) (Additional file 4: Figure
S2). This latter class consisted exclusively of putative
(and some characterized) phenylpropanoid, flavonoid,
and anthocyanin isogenes. Interestingly, putative isogenes of the phenylpropanoid pathway (4CL-like and
4CL2), the flavonoid pathway (CHS4/5, F3H-like, DFR2,
ANS2/ANS3), and the late-stage anthocyanin pathway
(UGT78K1, UGT78K2, OMT-like, OMT5, GST21 and
GST26) were all upregulated more than 2-fold in the
black (iRT) seed coat, more than 234-fold in the case of
the GST26 probe set (Table 3).
A BLASTP search of the soybean genome sequence
Glyma1 (http://www.phytozome.net/soybean) using the
conserved plant secondary product glycosyltransferase
signature sequence (PSPG box) [32] identified 214 annotated Family 1 glycosyltransferases (UGTs)(Additional
file 5: Table S3). Of the 214 UGTs, only 2 were found
to be upregulated more than 2-fold from the black (iRT)
seed coat; the recently identified UF3GT gene

UGT78K1 [18] was upregulated more than 2.8-fold and
a second uncharacterized glycosyltransferase, which we
named UGT78K2 in accordance with UGT nomenclature [33], was upregulated more than 3-fold (Table 3).
A search of the soybean genome sequence with the
conserved OMT-domain sequence (PLN02589; NCBI)
and the ontology ‘O-methyltransferase’, identified 84
annotated OMTs (Additional file 6: Table S4). Of the 84
OMT genes, only probe sets for OMT-like and OMT5
were upregulated in the black (iRT) seed coat, more
than 2.4-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively (Table 3).
A total of 52 probe sets were downregulated more
than 2-fold in the black (iRT) seed coat (i.e. black/
brown < 0.5 fold); among these, 2 probe sets by more
than 10-fold, 12 probe sets by more than 3-fold, with
the remainder between 2- and 3-fold (Table 4; Additional file 7: Table S5). Classification of down-regulated
genes using the Gene-Bins ontology tool demonstrated
the majority to be “unclassified without homology”
(45.5%) or “unclassified with homology” (12.1%), followed by “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites” (9.1%)
(Additional file 8: Figure S3). The latter class consisted
primarily of characterized and putative (iso)flavonoid
isogenes. Isogenes for common flavonoid biosynthesis
(CHS1, CHS9, F3’H), PA biosynthesis (LAR1), and isoflavone biosynthesis (IFR1-like) were all down-regulated
more than 2-fold in the black (iRT) seed coat, more

Page 8 of 18

than 35-fold in the case of the CHS1 (Table 4). The flavonoid genes CHS9 and F3’H were down-regulated
more than 21-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively, the putative
isoflavone gene IFR1-like by more than 3.6-fold, and the
putative PA gene LAR1 by more than 2.2-fold (Table 4).
Of the differentially regulated probe sets, 12 represented transcription factor genes, 8 were upregulated
and 4 downregulated (Additional file 3: Table S2 and
Additional file 7 Table S5, respectively), however none
of these genes clustered with known flavonoid transcription factor orthologs by phylogenetic analysis (not
shown).
A previous study mapped the R locus between markers A668_1 and K387_1 on MLG K (Chromosome 9)
[34]. Nineteen differentially-regulated probe sets were
associated with genes located on chromosome 9 of the
soybean genome sequence Glyma1 (Additional file 9:
Table S6). Interestingly, all genes were located in a 5.16
Mb region of the distal arm of chromosome 9, and only
the downregulated AP2/ERF (Glyma09g36840) and serine carboxypeptidase-like protein (Glyma09g36080) and
the upregulated polyamine oxidase (Glyma09g36150)
were located between markers (BARC-025669-04989
and Sat_293) that flank the putative position of the R
locus (http://soybeanphysicalmap.org) (Figure 5).
To validate the microarray results, 28 differentially-regulated genes were selected and their relative expression

profiles were measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR
(semi-qRT-PCR) using black (iRT) and brown (irT) seed
coat cDNA as templates. Phosphenol pyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) was used as the endogenous control to
ensure equal loading and the flavonoid genes CHS7/
CHS8 and the putative PA gene ANR1 were used as
negative controls as they were not found to be differentially expressed in the microarray analysis. Semi-qRTPCR confirmed the differential-expressions of all 28
genes and demonstrated similar expressions for CHS7/
CHS8 and ANR1 (Additional file 10: Figure S4). Furthermore, as the upregulated probe set GmaAffx.42116.1.S1
did not distinguish between CHS4 and CHS5 expressions, semi-qRT-PCR was performed with gene specific
primers to show the CHS4 gene, and not the CHS5 gene
to be upregulated in the black (iRT) seed coat (Additional file 10: Figure S4).
In summary, these results show that numerous specific anthocyanin, flavonoid and phenylpropanoid isogenes
are upregulated and other flavonoid, benzoic acid, and
isoflavone isogenes are downregulated in the black (iRT)
seed coat transcriptome relative to that of the nearlyisogenic brown (irT) tissue.
Putative Assignment of Function to Genes DifferentiallyRegulated between Black (iRT) and Brown (irT) Seed Coats

Gene functions can be successfully predicted based on a
combined analysis of transcriptome and metabolite data

[21]. We compared differences in gene expressions
determined by microarray to differences in metabolite
compositions to assign putative functions to genes from
the black (iRT) and brown (irT) seed coats (Figure 6). In
addition to 7 previously characterized soybean flavonoid
genes, several uncharacterized genes belonging to large
multi-gene families with possible roles in anthocyanin
biosynthesis and transport were upregulated; including
one glycosyltransferase (UGT78K2), two O-methyltransferases (OMT5 and OMT-like) and two glutathione Stransferases (GST21 and GST26) (Table 3). Considering
the accumulation of metabolites with specific molecular
structures in the black (iRT) seed coat, putative functions of the differentially-expressed genes were assigned
to specific structural modifications and transport functions (Figure 6).
Anthocyanins in the seed coat of black (iRT) soybean
are glycosylated at the 3-position of the C-ring (Figure
3). The glycosyltransferase UGT78K2 is assigned to
code a UDP-glycose:flavonoid 3-O-glycosyltransferase
(UF3GT) protein (Figure 6) and may have functional
redundancies in anthocyanin biosynthesis with the previously characterized UGT78K1 [18], which was also
upregulated in the black (iRT) seed coat (Table 3).
Two anthocyanins (petunidin-3-O-glucoside and peonidin-3-O-glucoside) and one deoxyanthocyanidin (diosmetinidin) from the black (iRT) seed coat are
methylated at the 3-position of the B-ring (the 3’-position) (Figure 3). The two upregulated O-methyltransferases were assigned to code anthocyanin 3’-Omethyltransferase (AOMT) proteins (Figure 6) and
may have redundant function in anthocyanin biosynthesis this tissue.
UGT78K2 and OMT5 Code UDP-Glycose:Flavonoid 3-OGlycosyltransferase and Anthocyanin 3’-OMethyltransferase Proteins, Respectively

Reducing the expressions of late-stage anthocyanin
genes by RNA interference (RNAi) in the seed coat of
black soybean may be an effective strategy to engineer
seed coat color while minimizing unintended effects on
other flavonoid subpathways. However, functional
redundancies may require that multiple genes be
silenced in order to reduce enzyme activity enough to
reduce pigment levels. Two glycosyltransferases
(UGT78K1 and UGT78K2) were upregulated in the
black (iRT) seed coat relative to the nearly-isogenic
brown (irT) tissue (Table 3) and the upregulation paralleled the accumulation of anthocyanins with 3-O-glycosylated structures (Figure 2), suggesting the function of
these genes as UDP-glycose:flavonoid 3-O-glycosyltransferases (UF3GTs). We have characterized UGT78K1
previously and shown it to possess UF3GT activity
towards anthocyanidins in vitro and in vivo [18]. To

determine the catalytic function of UGT78K2 [GenBank:
HM591298], the ORF was cloned into an N-terminal
hexahistidine fusion tag vector and expressed in E. coli
for analysis of the coded recombinant protein in vitro.
The recombinant protein (rUGT78K2) was purified by
ion-metal-affinity chromatography (IMAC) had an
apparent mass of 50.9 kDa that matched well with the
calculated mass of the native UGT78K2 protein (49.04
kDa) in addition to the 2.04 kDa N-terminal hexahistidine fusion tag encoded by the pET-14b vector (Figure
7A). In assays containing UDP-glucose as the sugar
donor and cyanidin as the acceptor, the recombinant
enzyme transferred glucose to the 3-position of cyanidin

to form cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (Figure 7B, C), whereas
the boiled enzyme and bacteria expressing the corresponding empty vector could not catalyze this reaction
(not shown). Similarly, in assays containing UDP-galactose as the sugar donor and cyanidin as the acceptor,
the recombinant enzyme transferred galactose to the 3position of cyanidin to form cyanidin-3-O-galactoside
(not shown). Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and cyanidin-3-Ogalactoside from recombinant enzyme assays were identified by HPLC-DAD in comparison to the authentic
standards, and confirmed by HPLC-MS/MS with the
characteristic parent ions 449.0 [cyanidin-3-O-glucoside

(-162 amu).
As we have performed the kinetics analysis for recombinant UGT78K1, we were able to employ the same
experimental conditions to test the kinetics of
UGT78K2. Interestingly, UGT78K2 converted cyanidin3-O-glucoside with greater velocity than UGT78K1 and
higher concentrations of cyanidin were required to inhibit its activity (Figure 7D) despite the enzymes having
93% amino acid similarity (Additional file 11: Figure S5).
Methylation of the B-ring of anthocyanins has a reddening effect on flower color (reviewed by [35]) and
thus engineering the expression of 3’-O-methyltransferases could change the redness of seed color. However,
despite the identification of several flavonoid OMTs
from soybean, none have been shown to accept anthocyanins as substrates. Our microarray analysis identified
two O-methyltransferases (OMT5 and OMT-like) to be
upregulated in the black (iRT) seed coat (Table 3) and
the upregulation paralleled the accumulation of 3’-Omethylated anthocyanins in this tissue (Figure 2), suggesting the function of these genes as anthocyanin 3’-Omethyltransferases (AOMTs). Following the approach
described above, the ORF of OMT5 [GenBank:
HQ856048] was cloned for expression and functional
characterization of the corresponding recombinant protein in vitro. The purified recombinant protein had an
apparent mass of 30.0 kDa that matched well with the
calculated mass (27.78 kDa) in addition to the 2.04 kDa
N-terminal hexahistidine fusion tag encoded by the
pET-14b vector (Figure 8A). In assays containing S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor and
cyanidin-3-O-glucoside as the acceptor, the recombinant
enzyme transferred a methyl group to the 3’-position of
the acceptor to form peonidin-3-O-glucoside (Figure 8B,
C), whereas the boiled enzyme and bacteria expressing
the corresponding empty vector could not catalyze this
reaction (not shown). Peonidin-3-O-glucoside from
recombinant enzyme assays was identified by HPLCDAD in comparison to the authentic standard, and confirmed by HPLC-MS/MS with the characteristic parent
ion 463.1 [peonidin-3-O-glucoside] +1 and the MS/MS
fragment 301.0 [peonidin]+1 corresponding to the loss of
glucose (-162 amu).
To further investigate the function these genes,
UGT78K2 and OMT5 expression profiles were measured
from seed coat cDNA throughout black (iRT) and
brown (irT) soybean seed development by quantitative
RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) (Figure 9) and expressions were
compared to anthocyanin accumulation profiles
throughout seed development (Figure 2). Similar to
UGT78K1, UGT78K2 and OMT5 expressions peaked at
the transition and early maturation stages of seed development (300 mg - 400 mg FSW, 400 mg - 500 mg

the brown (irT) seed coat.

Discussion
The seed coat compositions of black (iRT) and brown
(irT) soybean (Glycine max) were known to differ only
by the presence/absence of anthocyanins, however our
metabolite analysis demonstrated these nearly-isogenic
tissues to have extensive differences in anthocyanin,
proanthocyanidin (PA), (iso)flavonoid, and phenylpropanoid content (Table 2). Of the 37 compounds detected,
24 compounds (62.2% of all compounds identified by
HPLC-MS/MS) were exclusive to either the black (iRT)
or the brown (irT) seed coat. Analysis of the distributions of compound classes between seed coats demonstrated the black (iRT) to a have a greater proportion of
anthocyanins and PAs, and the brown (irT) to have a
greater proportion of flavonol, benzoic acid, isoflavone,
and unknown metabolite compositions (Figure 4). Metabolites exclusive to the black (iRT) seed coat included
PA trimers (Procyanidin trimer 1, 2, and 4) and an A-

Kovinich et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:381

type procyanidin dimer in addition to various anthocyanins (Table 2).
The anthocyanins identified from variety Clark were
mainly similar to those reported previously from various
Korean varieties [27,28] however Clark was the first
shown to contain a 3-deoxyanthocyanidin (diosmetinidin) in the seed coat (Table 2). 3-deoxyanthocyanidins
are relatively rare intensely coloured pigments found in
Sorghum bicolour in response to fungal attack [36], and
from the cotyledons of yellow soybean in response to
UV-C treatment [37]. The biosynthesis of 3-deoxyanthocyanidins from flavonones has been shown to be a
minor activity of a DFR isogene in Sorghum [38]. It
would be interesting to determine whether the DFR
gene that was highly overexpressed in the black Clark
seed coat (DFR2) had similar catalytic activity, and
whether the Korean varieties contain genetic alterations
related to DFR2.
Analysis of the black (iRT) seed coat transcriptome
compared to that of the nearly-isogenic brown (irT) tissue identified 80 probe sets to be upregulated (Table 3).
This is almost double the number of probe sets upregulated by overexpression of the MYB transcription factor
PAP1 in Arabidopsis (38 probe sets) [21], similar to the
number upregulated by overexpression of the anthocyanin factor LAP1 in M. truncatula (61 probe sets), and
less than half the number upregulated by overexpression
of LAP1 in M. sativa (270 probe sets) [39]. The higher
numbers of genes upregulated in anthocyanin-overaccumulating tissues of black soybean, M. truncatula and M.
sativa likely reflect the fact that legumes have undergone genome duplication and that genes with multiple
copies are frequently retained [19]. Our data supported
this hypothesis as duplicate copies of several genes were
upregulated in the black (iRT) seed coat (e.g. 4CL2 and
4CL-like, UGT78K2 and UGT78K1, OMT5 and OMTlike, and GST21 and GST26).
Functional redundancies can complicate gene identification by traditional approaches. Previous to the present
study, genes for only 5 flavonoid enzymes (CHS, F3H,
F3’H, F3’5’H, and UF3GT) were identified to be involved
in pigment biosynthesis in the soybean seed coat
[7,11-14,18]. In the present study, 20 isogenes for 14
proteins were identified to have putative roles in flavonoid biosynthesis in black (iRT) or brown (irT) seed
coats using a combined analysis of microarray and
metabolite data (Figure 6).
Transcriptome analysis has previously demonstrated a
critical role of CHS7 and CHS8 genes for isoflavonoid
biosynthesis in developing embryos of soybean [40].
However, our microarray and semi-quantitative RT-PCR
data demonstrated that CHS7 and CHS8 were not differentially regulated in black (iRT) and brown (irT) seed
coats (Table 3). Interestingly, it was CHS4 that was

Page 13 of 18

upregulated and CHS1 and CHS9 that were downregulatedin the black (iRT) seed coat (Table 3 and Table 4
respectively). As CHS4 is upregulated with anthocyanin
genes, it likely has a role in anthocyanin biosynthesis in
this tissue. Consistent with this, spontaneous mutations
of the dominant i i allele to the recessive i allele have
been shown to affect the promoter region of the CHS4
gene [7]. By contrast, the downregulation of CHS1 and
CHS9 may suggest that they have a role in the parallel
downregulated biochemical pathways, such as flavonol
and isoflavonoid biosynthesis, as these metabolites, and
transcript levels of genes for their biosynthesis, were
reduced or not present in the black (iRT) seed coat (Figure 6). These results emphasize the complexity of isogene expressions that exist to achieve a single enzyme
function in soybean.
Microarray analysis identified differentially regulated
probe sets for only 3 gene functions (LAR, GST, and
MATE) that have been previously shown to be involved
in PA biosynthesis and transport. Recombinant LAR
enzymes from several legume species have been shown
to convert leucocyanidin to (+)-catechin in vitro
[25,26,41,42]. However, the in vivo role of LAR in PA
biosynthesis remains questionable as endogenous
expression has been shown not to correlate with PA
levels in M. truncatula and heterologous expression has
failed to increase PA accumulations [41]. Similarly, our
metabolite data showed that soybean PAs lack catechin
subunits (Additional file 2: Figure S1) and that LAR1
expressions (Figure 1) do not parallel PA accumulations
during seed development (not shown). Interestingly, 4
PAs were found to be exclusive to the black (iRT) seed
coat (Table 2) however the total subunit compositions,
the mean degree of polymerization (mDP), and the total
amounts of soluble and solvent-insoluble PAs were not
different compared to the brown (irT) seed coat (Additional file 2: Figure S1). These results suggest the PA
oligomers of black (iRT) and brown (irT) seed coats
may differ only in their subunit linkages. However, the
potential influence of LAR or other PA genes on PA
subunit linkages (if any) remains to be determined.
From the set of differentially regulated genes identified
by microarray, two putative late-stage anthocyanin genes
were selected and the functions of their coded enzymes
were determined in vitro. UGT78K2 was found to code
a UF3GT enzyme for anthocyanin biosynthesis (Figure
7). A UF3GT cDNA (UGT78K1) has recently been isolated from the black seed coat and functionally characterized [18]. UGT78K2 was 93% similar to UGT78K1
but possessed increased catalytic activity towards cyanidin (Figure 7D). The identification gene redundancy has
important implications for seed coat color engineering
by RNA interference, as both copies of the gene may
have to be silenced to achieve a significant reduction in

Kovinich et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:381
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/381

UF3GT activity. Similarly, two OMT genes (OMT5 and
OMT-like) were found to be overexpressed in the black
seed coat (Table 3). OMT5 was cloned and found to
code an AOMT enzyme in vitro (Figure 8). UF3GT and
OMT genes may be ideal candidates for seed coat color
engineering as suppression of UF3GT genes (UGT78K1
and UGT78K2) may result in a reduction in anthocyanin
levels similar to that caused by a T-DNA insertion in
the Arabidopsis UF3GT [21] and upregulation of an
AOMT may result in a more red seed coat, as methylation of the B-ring of anthocyanins has a reddening effect
on flower color (reviewed by [35]). However, it remains
to be determined whether altering the expressions of
these genes could be use to modify seed coat color without causing unintended effects on alternative biochemical pathways.
Prior to the present study, currently known soybean
genes did not map between markers A668_1 and
K387_1 on chromosome 9 of the soybean physical genomic map, where the R locus is located, leaving no
obvious candidates for the R locus gene [15]. In our
study, 14 genes identified to be differentially regulated
in the black (iRT) soybean seed coat transcriptome were
found to be located on chromosome 9 of the soybean
genome sequence Glyma1 (Figure 5). Among the gene
families represented, only WD40 and MYB have known
roles in flavonoid regulation. However the genes demonstrated did not cluster with known flavonoid regulators
by phylogenetic analysis (not shown). A Mob1/phocein
gene was commonly upregulated in the black (iRT) soybean seed coat and Arabidopsis seedlings overexpressing
PAP1 [21]. Other regulatory gene families represented
on chromosome 9 were AP2/ERF, serine/threonine protein kinase, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein
kinase, and ethylene-responsive element-binding protein.
Interestingly, all upregulated and downregulated genes
on chromosome 9 were located in 5.16 Mb region that
includes the nearest sequence markers to the R locus.
Only the downregulated AP2/ERF transcription factor,
the serine carboxypeptidase gene, and the gene moderately similar to the A. thaliana polyamine oxidase
ATPAO1 were located between these sequence markers
(Figure 5). As a result our study provides a short list of
gene candidates that may serve as the focus of future
efforts to identify the R locus gene.

Conclusion
Metabolite composition and gene expression differences
between black (iRT) and brown (irT) seed coats are far
more extensive than previously thought. Putative anthocyanin, proanthocyanidin, (iso)flavonoid, and phenylpropanoid isogenes were differentially-expressed between
black (iRT) and brown (irT) seed coats, and UGT78K2
and OMT5 were validated to code UDP-glycose:

Page 14 of 18

flavonoid-3-O-glycosyltransferase and anthocyanin 3’-Omethyltransferase proteins in vitro, respectively. Duplicate gene copies for several enzymes were overexpressed
in the black (iRT) seed coat suggesting more than one
isogene may have to be silenced to engineer seed coat
color using RNA interference.

Methods
Chemicals

Cyanidin was purchased from Indofine (Somerville, NJ,
USA) UDP-glucose and SAM from Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, ON, CA), the 3-O-glucosides of delphinidin and
petunidin from Polyphenols (Hanaveien, NO), and all
other phytochemicals were purchased from Extrasynthese (Lyon, FR). All solvents for LC-MS/MS and HPLCDAD analyses were of HPLC grade purchased from
Fisher Scientific (Ottawa, ON, Canada).
Plant Materials and Growth Conditions

Black (iRT) soybean (G. max (L.) Merr.) variety Clark
(PI547438) and the nearly isogenic brown (irT) soybean
(PI 547475) were obtained from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture Soybean Germplasm Collection (Agricultural Research Service, University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana). Seeds were surface-sterilized in 2%
triton/70% EtOH-H2O (7:3, v/v) for 5 min on a mixer
wheel, rinsed three times with EtOH, dried, and germinated in autoclaved vermiculite in a Conviron E15 cabinet with a photoperiod of 16 h light (590 μE m2 s) at
25°C, and 8 h dark at 20°C. Plants were fertilized twice
weekly with N:P:K 35-5-10 (1% w/v). After 12 days,
seedlings were transplanted to autoclaved soil and 34
days later the photoperiod was changed to 12 h light/12
h dark to encourage reproductive development. For
RNA isolation, seed coats were dissected from plants,
immediately frozen in liquid N2, lyophilized, and stored
at -80°C. Seed coats for comparative analyses were harvested on the same days, 4 h after the initiation of the
light cycle to minimize for potential differences in transcript and metabolite accumulations that may be influenced by circadian rhythm.
Seed Coat Metabolite Analyses

Lyophilized seed coats (~40 mg) from each developmental stage were pulverized in HCO2H-MeOH-H2O (400
μL, 15:80:5, v/v) using a FastPrep FP120 Homogenizer
(Savant) and incubated at 4°C for 2 h. The slurry was
centrifuged at 20,000 g for 10 min, and 5 μl of supernatant from each sample was measured by photospectroscopy using a NANODROP 2000 (Thermo Scientific)
according to the formula A530-0.25A657 to compensate
for chlorophyll absorption at 530 nm (Mancinelli, 1990).
The quantity of anthocyanins was determined by comparison to a standard curve and expressed as cyanidin

3-O-glucoside equivalents. For HPLC-DAD and LCQTRAP analyses samples were extracted for an additional 24 h and 200 μl of supernatant was vortexed with
HCO 2 H-MeOH (1 mL, 15:85, v/v) for 20 sec, centrifuged at 20,000 g for 10 min, and the supernatant was
evaporated under a stream of nitrogen gas (to 50 μL),
filtered through PVDF (0.45 μm; Millipore), and 20 μl
and 5 μl aliquots were analyzed by HPLC-DAD and
HPLC-MS/MS respectively, as described below.
For analysis of proanthocyanidins (PAs), lyophilized
seed coats were ground to a powder, extracted with 70%
acetone (1 mg mL -1 ) and analyzed as described previously [30,31] with (-)-epicatechin, (+)-catechin, and
(-)-epicatechin gallate used as standards for the identification of free monomers, and procyanidin B2 used as a
standard for the analysis of soluble and insoluble PA oligomer compositions. Quantitation of soluble PAs by
reaction with DMACA reagent and insoluble PAs by
acid-catalyzed cleavage was performed as described [43]
using procyanidin B2 and cyanidin as standards for the
respective assays.
Microarray Analysis, Semi-qRT-PCR, and qRT-PCR

Total RNA was isolated from pigmented soybean seed
coats as described previously (Wang and Vodkin, 1994).
The quantity and purity of RNA samples were determined by spectrophotometry using a NANODROP 2000
(Thermo Scientific). RNA integrity was confirmed by
microfluidics using a Bioanalyser 2100 equipped with an
RNA 6000 Nano Chip (Agilent Technologies Inc., Montreal, QC, Canada).
Microarray was performed on RNA isolated from
three plants of each genotype. Briefly, 100 ng of total
RNA was in vitro transcribed for 16 h using the GeneChip 3’IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix, http://www.affymetrix.com). Labelled RNA was hybridized to
GeneChip Soybean Genome Arrays as described by the
manufacturer (Affymetrix). Statistical analyses of data
for the identification of differentially regulated genes
were performed using FlexArray software (M. Blazejczyk and associates; Genome Quebec, Montreal) that
uses R and Bio-Conductor [44]. The raw data was
adjusted for background signal, and normalized across
all GeneChips using the Robust Multi-array Average
(RMA) method [45]. To identify differentially
expressed genes, the SAM algorithm, which minimizes
variation across arrays and incorporates an estimate of
false discovery rate (FDR) [46], was used. Only genes
with a fold change > 2 or < 0.5 and a P value < 0.01
were considered to be differentially expressed. All
materials and procedures comply with the MIAME
standards for array data [47]. The full dataset has been
deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO:
GSE26208].

For semi-quantitative RT-PCR (semi-qRT-PCR), RNA
samples (3 μg) were treated with DNase I (Amplification
grade, Invitrogen) at 37°C for 15 min to remove contaminating DNA. Reactions (20 μl) were terminated by
heating (65°C for 10 min) in the presence of 1 ul of 25
mM EDTA. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using
SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Parallel
reactions were performed in the absence of Superscript
III to test for genomic DNA contamination. Gene
expressions from each cDNA sample were normalized
to the endogenous reference PEPC16. Semi-quantitative
RT-PCR (semi-qRT-PCR) reactions (20 μl) consisted of
2 μl of first-strand cDNA (or untreated RNA), 400 nM
primers, 200 μM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1X Taq Buffer,
2.5 units Taq polymerase (Fermentas). PCR cycling was
94°C for 2 min, followed by 23, 25, and 27 cycles for
CHS7/CHS8 or 27, 30, 33 cycles for all other genes, 94°
C for 15 sec, 58°C for 1 min, and 72°C 1 min.
For quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), cDNA template
was prepared as described above. Reactions (25 μl) consisted of 2 μl of first-strand cDNA (or untreated RNA),
250 nM of forward and reverse primers, and 12.5 μl of
the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad). qRT-PCR of
each target gene for each seed coat sample was performed in triplicate on cDNA samples or untreated
RNA samples using an PTC-200 Peltier thermal cycler
equipped with a Chromo4 continuous fluorescence
detector (MJ research). PCR cycling was 95°C for 10
min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 58°C for 1
min, and 72°C 1 min. qRT-PCR data and PCR efficiencies were analyzed using the Opticon Monitor 3 software (BioRad). To verify the specificity of the RT-PCR
reactions, melting curves were performed subsequent to
each reaction in addition to fractionation of RT-PCR
products on agarose gels. Semi-qRT-PCR and qRT-PCR
experiments were performed in triplicate. Primers used
in this study can be found in Additional file 12: Table
S7.
Cloning of UGT78K2 and OMT5 cDNAs from the Seed
Coat of Black Soybean

To clone the full-length coding sequences (CDSs) of
UGT78K2 and OMT5, PCR primers were designed
based on the transcript sequence predicted for Glyma08g07130 (http://www.phytozome.net/soybean) and
based on the mRNA sequence of BT098523, respectively. Full-length CDSs for UGT78K2 and OMT5 were
amplified from black (iRT) seed coat cDNA by end-toend PCR using primers UHF/UAR and HO5F/HO5R,
respectively (Additional file 12: Table S7) and a highfidelity DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The resulting
UGT78K2 and OMT5 amplicons (1466 bp and 836 bp,
respectively) were cloned into NdeI and BamHI sites,

Kovinich et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:381
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/381

and NdeI and XhoI sites of the pET-14b vector (Novagen), respectively, and sequenced to confirm their
identities.
Expression of Recombinant Proteins in E. coli

The full-length CDSs of UGT78K2 and OMT5 were
independently fused in-frame to the N-terminal hexahistidine tag encoded by the pET-14b vector (above). Plasmids were transformed into the expression host E. coli
BL21(DE3) pLysS (Novagen) and a single colony for
each plasmid was selected for production of recombinant proteins. Soluble recombinant proteins were isolated following growth and induction of E. coli BL21
(DE3) pLysS at 16°C. Recombinant proteins were purified by ion metal-affinity chromatography (IMAC) using
a kit (Novagen). To confirm the purity of the recombinant enzyme, the eluted fractions were visualized on
12.5% acrylamide gel stained with 0.25% Coomassie
Blue. The amount of purified recombinant enzyme was
determined using the BioRad reagent.
Recombinant Enzyme Assays

The UGT78K2 assay (total volume 100 μl) was performed as described previously [18] and consisted of
recombinant enzyme (2 μg), cyanidin (20 μM), and
UDPG (5 mM) in assay solution. The OMT 5 assay (total
volume 200 μl) consisted of recombinant enzyme (3 μg),
SAM (100 μM), MgCl2 (150 μM), Tris pH 7.5 (50 mM),
and 2-mercaptoethanol (14 mM). UGT78K2 and OMT 5
assays were incubated for 5 min at 30°C and 1 h at 35°C,
respectively. Reactions were stopped by vortexing in
MeOH (500 μl) for 20 s. Reaction products were identified by comparison to commercial standards dissolved in
MeOH. Reactions were prepared for HPLC by centrifugation (21,000 g for 4 min at 4°C) followed by concentration of the supernatant to final volume of 50 μl under a
stream of N2 gas. All reactions were filtered through
PTFE (0.45 μm; Millipore, MA USA) and 20 μl aliquots
were analyzed by HPLC-DAD. Assays were performed in
triplicate and experiments repeated thrice.
HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS/MS Analyses

HPLC-DAD analysis of anthocyanins was performed as
described previously [18]. Briefly, separations were
achieved at 45°C on a Luna C18(2), 4.6 × 150 mm, particle size 5 μm fitted with a corresponding guard-column (Phenonenex Inc, Santa Ana, CA) using an Agilent
1100 series (Agilent Technologies Inc., Montreal, QC,
Canada) equipped with an autosampler with a 100 μL
loop, a quaternary pump (maximum pressure, 400 bars),
a column thermostat, and a diode array detector (DAD).
The mobile phase consisted of 5% HCO2H in H2O (solvent A) and MeOH (solvent B). Optimized elution conditions were a linear gradient of 10-100% B in 25 min

Page 16 of 18

with a flow rate of 1 ml min-1, the column was washed
for 10 min with 100% B, brought back to starting mobile
phase composition in 0.1 min and equilibrated for 5 min
prior to the next injection. The HPLC separations were
monitored at 520, 476, 350, 280, and 254 nm. The relative quantities of anthocyanins were calculated based on
percent area of each peak eluting at specific retention
times.
The HPLC-ESI-MS/MS system consisted of an Agilent
1200 series (Agilent Technologies Inc., Montreal, QC,
Canada) connected directly to a 3200QTRAP (ABI
Sciex, Toronto, Canada). The software used for data
acquisition and analysis is Analyst 1.4.2. The chromatographic conditions were the same as described for the
HPLC-DAD analysis anthocyanins. The mobile phase
was split 50/50 post-column. For enhanced mass scan
(EMS), the MS was operated in positive polarity at a
scan rate of 4000 amu s-1 within the mass range of 100
- 1000 amu. The optimal source conditions of the mass
spectrometer were: collision gas high, curtain gas (N2)
25 L min-1, ion spray voltage 4500 V, source temperature 500°C, source gas 1 (at 50 psig), source gas 2 (at 55
psig). The optimal compound parameters were declustering potential (DP) +20 V, entrance potential (EP) +10
V, collision energy (CE) 10 V, ionization energy 1.0 eV
and detector 2800. For enhanced product ion scan the
information dependant acquisition (IDA) criteria was as
follows: select 1 - 2 most intense peaks which exceeds
10,000 cps, exclude targeted ions after 3 occurrences for
12 s. Product ions were scanned within the mass range
of 100 - 1000 amu. All source parameters were the
same as for EMS. The optimal compound parameters
were DP +70 V, EP +10 V, CE 65 V, and collision
energy spread 40 V.
