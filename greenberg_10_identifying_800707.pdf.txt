Identifying experimental surrogates for Bacillus
anthracis spores: a review
David L Greenberg, Joseph D Busch, Paul Keim, David M Wagner*

Abstract
Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, is a proven biological weapon. In order to study this threat, a
number of experimental surrogates have been used over the past 70 years. However, not all surrogates are appropriate for B. anthracis, especially when investigating transport, fate and survival. Although B. atrophaeus has been
widely used as a B. anthracis surrogate, the two species do not always behave identically in transport and survival
models. Therefore, we devised a scheme to identify a more appropriate surrogate for B. anthracis. Our selection criteria included risk of use (pathogenicity), phylogenetic relationship, morphology and comparative survivability
when challenged with biocides. Although our knowledge of certain parameters remains incomplete, especially
with regards to comparisons of spore longevity under natural conditions, we found that B. thuringiensis provided
the best overall fit as a non-pathogenic surrogate for B. anthracis. Thus, we suggest focusing on this surrogate in
future experiments of spore fate and transport modelling.
Background
Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, has
received much attention in the past decade due to its
use in 2001 as a biological weapon distributed through
the USA mail system. However, B. anthracis spores have
been used as a weapon for close to 100 years and, historically, this pathogen was an important disease model
[1]. This bacterium also provides a nearly perfect model
of prokaryotic clonal evolution, with rare genomic
recombination and extremely low levels of homoplasy
[2]. The body of research acquired for B. anthracis provides key insights into its biology, epidemiology and the
risks associated with its release into a civilian environment [3]. However, an important gap still remains in
our empirical understanding of B. anthracis spore survival and mobility. As a result, it is necessary to examine
and develop more accurate fate and transport models of
anthrax spores in order to better understand public
health risks and develop methods for emergency
response to a mass release.
Mathematical fate and transport models provide a
means of predicting the distribution of pathogenic particles after their release into air or water. Clearly, such
information is an important asset in risk assessment

following a terrorist attack or a biological accident. Scenarios for intentional release into a civilian area include
infecting the water supply or releasing aerosolized
spores [4,5]. In a 1970 report, the World Health Organization predicted that 50 kg of spores released upwind of
500,000 civilians would result in 95,000 fatalities; likewise, a single subway attack could lead to over 10,000
deaths if carried out during rush hour [6]. Model
scenarios and the 2001 events demonstrate that non-targeted individuals are also vulnerable. However, models
may lack predictive power if their critical parameters are
not based on real world values. Therefore, it is necessary
to collect experimental data that will lead to greater
model accuracy of spore behaviour. For example, our
laboratory group is performing experiments to measure
attenuation values for spore survivability in natural and
artificial environments (such as water, soil and fomites).
These and other experiments will help to validate the
predictions of current mathematical models, thereby
increasing model accuracy and improving our response
to natural, accidental or intentional releases of anthrax.
Fully virulent B. anthracis must be handled under biosafety level (BSL)-3 conditions and requires secure containment. Therefore, we cannot experimentally release
this organism into the environment nor use it in experiments outside of a BSL3 facility. In order to conduct
experiments that inform release models, we must use a

non-pathogenic bacterium that can accurately represent
B. anthracis. Surrogates of this type have been used for
many years in military release experiments, water supply
studies and food protection assessment. However, little
attention has been focused on the criteria used to select
surrogates. Our synthesis makes use of existing empirical evidence to present an informed decision for the
best choice of a B. anthracis surrogate.

History of surrogate use for B. anthracis
Before selecting an appropriate surrogate for B. anthracis, it is useful to review the history of surrogate use for
this organism. This information, though anecdotal in
some cases, provides valuable information useful for surrogate selection such as (1) comparative survival and
behavioural data, (2) an initial list of potential surrogate
candidates and (3) baseline data to compare against current experiments. Over the years a number of surrogates
have been used, including an attenuated B. anthracis
strain (Sterne) and several phylogenetic relatives:
B. atrophaeus (formerly B. globigii and B. subtilis niger
[7,8]), B. cereus, B. megaterium, B. mycoides, B. subtilis,
B. thuringiensis and Geobacillus (Figure 1). Table 1 indicates the number of times each has been utilized in
published studies. B. atrophaeus has been employed
most frequently; B. cereus, B. subtilis and B. thuringiensis have been used moderately; and the others have been
used just a few times (B. megaterium, B. mycoides and
Geobacillus).
Both the USA and Japanese governments used pathogenic simulants in biological warfare test studies. For
example, Yoshi Iishi of Japan confessed after World
War II to using B. anthracis surrogates in his biological
warfare programme, which was initiated in 1935 [9].
The USA began using B. atrophaeus as their major nonpathogenic surrogate for B. anthracis in July of 1943 at

Page 2 of 12

Camp Detrick [9]. This surrogate has been used for
many experiments in order to ascertain potential outcomes of using anthrax as a biological weapon [10-12].
In 1949 the USA Army experimentally sprayed B. atrophaeus and Serratia marcescens over the coastal population centers of Hampton, Virginia and San Francisco,
California [9]. B. atrophaeus was also disseminated in
Greyhound bus and New York subway terminals via
covert spray generators hidden in briefcases during the
mid-1960 s [11]. More recent work at national laboratories has emphasized the detection and identification of
spores in the environment.
The earliest in-depth comparison of related Bacillus
species was done by Schneiter and Kolb [13,14], who
tested heat processing methods to destroy ‘industrial’
spores of B. anthracis, B. subtilis and B. cereus found on
shaving brush bristles. Brazis et al. [15] made a direct
comparison of the effect of free available chlorine on
B. anthracis and B. atrophaeus spores and found that
B. atrophaeus was more resistant to chlorine. In these
early works, no mention is made of the potential for
these species to be used as B. anthracis surrogates.
However, their results provide valuable comparative
data (for example, B. atrophaeus is more resistant to
chlorine and therefore is a conservative surrogate for
estimating B. anthracis survival in tap water).
More recent experiments have examined the effects of
various environmental challenges and disinfectants on
B. anthracis surrogates, including studies of food protection or decontamination in the wake of a release event.
Faille et al. [16] used B. thuringiensis as a non-pathogenic representative for B. cereus and indicated that
B. thuringiensis has been used in this capacity for many
years. Others have used B. atrophaeus, B. thuringiensis,
B. cereus and B. subtilis to examine decontamination
strategies using various bactericidal compounds such as

chlorine, hydrogen peroxide, dyes, neutral oxone chloride, formaldehyde, gluteraldehyde and antibiotics
[15,17-43]. Additional decontamination methods used
against these surrogates include ultraviolet irradiation
[39,44-50], plasma [51], electron beam radiation [52,53]
and heat [39,54-63].
B. anthracis stand-ins have also played an important
role in evaluating the broad arsenal of techniques used
to detect and identify bio-threat agents in the environment. At least 17 methods have been employed to
detect spores of B. anthracis and its relatives, including:
electron microscopy [64], atomic force microscopy
[65-68], photothermal spectroscopy [69], microcalorimetric spectroscopy [70], biochip sensors [71,72],
Raman spectroscopy [73], polymerase chain reaction
methods [74-80], optical chromatography [81], differential mobility spectroscopy [82], laser induced breakdown
spectroscopy [83-86], flow cytometry sorting [87], mass
spectroscopy [88-96], proteomics [97,98], luminescence
analysis [99], long-wave biosensors [100], lytropic liquid
sensors [101] and fluorescent labelling [102-105].
Although most of these studies used B. anthracis
directly, some included close relatives for comparisons
of detectability across species.
Lastly, surrogates have played an important role in
several types of aerosol studies. They have been used to
evaluate electrical forces [106,107], examine the effect of
filter material on bioaerosol collection [108] and to
determine if bees could be deployed to detect anthrax
spores in the air [109]. Other studies have used standins such as B. thuringiensis to test spore movement in
aerial spray [4,110,111], transport and deposition efficiency of spores in ventilation ducts [112], engineered
aerosol production [113] and re-aerosolization of spores
[114]. B. atrophaeus has been used to reproduce an
anthrax letter event, demonstrating how an individual
swine located 1.5 m from an opened letter inhaled
>21,000 spores [115]. This is a lethal dose for humans
exposed to B. anthracis and validates the significant biothreat of passive spore dispersion.

From the diverse experimental uses of anthrax
surrogates during the last 70 years, it is obvious that
non-pathogenic representatives are indispensable for
conducting safe inquiries into the behaviour and mobility of pathogen spores. However, not all species are
equally appropriate stand-ins for B. anthracis. In the
remainder of this review we outline our selection criteria, present pertinent literature for surrogate selection
in B. anthracis and identify gaps in our knowledge of a
surrogate’s ability to mimic the behaviour of this pathogen. Whenever possible, we present quantified values to
provide robust justification of any surrogate to be used
in future fate and transport experiments.

Selection criteria
We used several criteria for selection, including (1) the
risk of use (pathogenicity), (2) genetic similarity to
B. anthracis, (3) morphology and (4) response to various
chemical and environmental challenges. Our initial list
began with microbes in the family Bacillaceae that have
been used as surrogates in the past. Practical attributes
of potential surrogates are summarized in Table 2. It is
important to select appropriate representatives with
regard to the specific experiments one wishes to conduct. As an example, if we were interested in studying
the disinfectant capacity of a substance we would use a
surrogate that has greater survivability than our target
organism. The results would then provide conservative
estimates of appropriate disinfectant levels. In our case,
we are interested in physical experiments of mobility in
water and air media. Hence, we determined that the
physical properties of the spores are of greatest interest,
including size, shape, density, surface morphology, surface structure and surface hydrophobicity. Behavioural
responses to stress and natural conditions are also relevant to spore survival.
Surrogate pathogenicity
The risks associated with surrogate use are of critical
concern. Table 3 lists the biosafety designations for the

potential surrogates. Surrogates are typically used to
replace a pathogen that, if used, would present a potential threat to public health. B. anthracis is classified as a
BSL-3 organism and work must be conducted under
highly contained conditions not suitable for fate and
transport experiments. Ideally, an attenuated strain of
B. anthracis would be a good surrogate because it
should behave similarly to the pathogenic strains and
pose little risk. However, our knowledge of plasmid
exchange rates and the environmental effects of these
strains remains very limited - they may still pose a risk
despite being classified as BSL-2 organisms. In addition,
detection of B. anthracis in the environment, even of an
attenuated strain, could cause a public relations issue.
Worse, released surrogates might mask a real attack or
create high background positives and unnecessary emergency responses. Therefore, we feel that non-pathogenic
B. anthracis strains are not good surrogates for fate and
transport experiments.
Another surrogate of interest is B. cereus. This species is
an opportunistic food-borne pathogen that can infect
humans [116,117] and the CDC recommends the handling of the organism at BSL-2 standards. Although it is
naturally found in the environment, additional releases
of this potential pathogen are deemed unsafe. As such,
this organism cannot be used as a replacement for
B. anthracis in spore release studies. The same is true
for B. megaterium and Geobacillus stearothermophilus,
which are treated as BSL-2 organisms.

The other potential surrogates, including B. atrophaeus, B. mycoides, B. subtilis and B. thuringiensis, are
not typically regarded as potential human pathogens or
select agents. They are BSL-1 organisms and are safe
candidates. B. thuringiensis is used as an insecticide
throughout the world, and has been shown to pose no
health risk to humans in some studies [118,119]. Infections do occasionally occur, however. These include a
case from using commercial B. thuringiensis var. kurstaki [120], a wound infection identified as B. thuringiensis strain 97-27 [74,121], and an isolate recovered
from a gastrointestinal illness [122]. That said, the overall the use of most B. thuringiensis strains appears to be
safe and this species provides a good potential surrogate
for B. anthracis [118,119]. B. atrophaeus is commonly
found in soil throughout the world, is considered nonpathogenic and has been used extensively as a surrogate
for B. anthracis [40,123]. B megaterium and B. subtilis
are also found in the soil and are non-pathogenic to
humans. Based on safety concerns, most candidates
except B. cereus could serve as a surrogate for
B. anthracis.

Genetics of the potential surrogates
Genetic relationships are important when selecting a surrogate because, theoretically, a phylogenetic relative
should be morphologically and behaviorally more similar
and have comparable physical characteristics to the target
organism. There have been many genetic studies that elucidate the phylogenetic relationships of organisms related
to B. anthracis [74,98,124-143]. The results of these studies indicate that B. anthracis is most closely related to
B. cereus, B. thuringiensis and B. mycoides, which are
grouped together as the B. cereus group (Figure 1). In
contrast, B. subtilis, B. atrophaeus, B. megaterium, and
Geobacillus are more distant relatives of B. anthracis. As
their chromosomal genomes are very similar, some
authors have suggested that B. cereus, B. thuringiensis
and B. anthracis are actually a single species separated
only by different plasmid composition [130]. However,
highly informative genetic markers such as single nucleotide polymorphisms can resolve B. anthracis from these
near neighbor species [144,145]. The identification of

Greenberg et al. Investigative Genetics 2010, 1:4
http://www.investigativegenetics.com/content/1/1/4

closely related surrogates does not present a problem
when these powerful genetic tools are used. The importance of genetic similarity on spore composition is
demonstrated by the BclA gene, which is unique to the
B. cereus group. This protein is found in the exosporium
and helps determine the adhesive properties of the spore
[146,147]. As B. atrophaeus and B. megaterium are lacking this gene, we would expect important changes in
behavior compared to B. anthracis.

Morphology of the potential surrogates
Morphological characters are important to consider
when choosing a surrogate because physical behaviours
are the foundation of transport models. As stated earlier,
genetic relatedness is a good indicator of morphological
similarity, so we expect organisms within the B. cereus
group to be morphologically similar to B. anthracis.
Microscopy examination reveals few morphological features that can be used to definitively distinguish the various species from one another [64,65,68]. However,
spores present measurable differences among surrogates,
including the structure of the exosporium, the presence/
absence of filamentous appendages and size variation.
The spores of the B. cereus group all possess a specific
type of exosporium surrounding the outer spore coat.
It is a balloon-like sac that envelopes the spore, is made
of crystal lattices and, typically, has a short nap of
hair-like projections extending off the surface
[64-68,146,148-154]. The exosporium can be highly variable, both among B. anthracis relatives [155-157] and
within B. anthracis, as shown by differences between the
Vollum and Sterne strains [158]. Some species also have
long appendages that extend off the exosporium, known
as filaments. B. cereus, B. megaterium and B. thuringiensis all possess filaments, whereas B. anthracis has none
[64,149-152,158-161]. More distant relatives such as
B. atrophaeus and B. subtilis have neither a nap nor filaments [67,68,152,162]. Likewise, B. atrophaeus and B.
megaterium have an atypical exosporium-like layer that
is distinct but does not extend off the surface of the
outer coat [64,67,148,152,162-165]. B. thuringiensis has a
similar nap to B. anthracis but the presence or absence
of filaments in B. thuringiensis is variable [152,166-168].
It is important to note that the exosporium is strongly
hydrophobic [169] and that this chemical property may
influence flow dynamics in aqueous solutions. Therefore,
species with less hydrophobic spores (B. subtilis) are
probably not appropriate simulants compared to the B.
cereus group. As differences in exterior morphology will
influence the mobility of pathogen spores in air and
water, the investigation of these dynamics is a muchneeded focus of future research.
Size, shape and density of the spore are also considered important factors that can influence surrogate

Page 5 of 12

behavior in release experiments. The spores of the B.
cereus group have similar ratios of length to width and
similar diameters, whereas the spores of B. atrophaeus
are smaller and those of B. megaterium are larger
[65,68,170,171]. Although the difference in size is not
great, it does exist and may require different coefficients
for various model parameters (such as, Reynolds number, diffusion coefficient and sedimentation velocity)
[172,173]. Spore volume is strongly correlated to density
(R = 0.95) when spores are wet and in a moistened state
the smaller spores of B. atrophaeus and B. subtilis are
much more dense than B. anthracis [174]. Such differences are likely to affect the behaviour of these particles
in air or water. Wet B. thuringiensis spores have densities and volumes within the range of B. anthracis, making this simulant a better match for the measurement of
liquid dispersion. Interestingly, dry spore density is similar among the surrogates listed in Table 1, despite
volume differences [174]. Thus, the right choice of surrogate appears to depend on the dispersion medium
under consideration.

Comparative survivability among surrogates
Previous experiments comparing the survivability of various spore-formers provide valuable information to the
surrogate selection process. Comparative experiments of
spore survival under natural conditions or exposure to
heat, ultraviolet and chemical disinfectants can illuminate which species may behave similarly to B. anthracis
in experiments. In this section we review the literature
for comparative spore survival.
Quantitative data relating inactivation kinetics of the
natural survival of spores would be of great value when
comparing potential surrogates. Unfortunately, most of
the available data are qualitative. Past studies with
B. anthracis have revealed that spores may survive for
years under natural conditions [175-190]. The data are
mostly qualitative, not directly comparable, and primarily exist only for B. anthracis. Experimental evidence
that quantifies survival rates in both the short and long
term are missing. Several studies examined the attenuation rate of B. thuringiensis spores on leaves, soil and
snow [191-197]; B. cereus was included in a survival
study measuring the effects of soil pH, moisture, nutrients and presence of other microbes [198]. In addition
to two aerosol field studies [110,199], we found no
other studies that investigated natural attenuation rates
of the potential surrogates for B. anthracis or that compared several species at once. Another drawback to
using these data is that spore behaviour is variable due
to factors such as purification method, sporulation conditions and strain type, and in many of these studies different purification protocols and strains are used, which
makes direct comparisons of the values mostly pointless.

Greenberg et al. Investigative Genetics 2010, 1:4
http://www.investigativegenetics.com/content/1/1/4

Nevertheless these values do have some comparative
information that can be used for surrogate selection. For
example, natural attenuation values have been quantified
for B. cereus and B. thuringiensis demonstrating that,
after 135 days, the number of viable B. thuringiensis
spores falls to about a quarter of the original inoculum
[194]. The same may be true for B. anthracis but data
are lacking. Although some spores remain active for a
long time, the rate at which they lose viability is
unknown, which suggests that additional experimental
evidence is required to confirm the decay rates for
B. anthracis spores and the potential surrogates.
Many experiments have been conducted that examine
the effects of heat on spores [39,54,57,63,200-208].
However, very few studies have focused on quantifying
differences in the survival of spores with regards to surrogate selection. More recent studies have compared the
affect of heat on spores with the intention to understand
differences among species. The main focus of most of
these experiments is related to industrial sanitation, particularly disinfection in the food industry
[58-60,62,209-211]. Montville and coworkers [60] have
published the only study that specifically compares
attenuation values among several surrogates. Whitney et
al. [39] review some of the studies on the thermal survival of B. anthracis, whereas Mitscherlich and March
[212] provide a very comprehensive review on the overall survival of B. anthracis and many of the potential
surrogate candidates. However, it is apparent that the
variability of D values (decimal reduction times) within
species is large enough that we cannot make any robust
decisions based upon this comparative information [60].
Rather, from these data we realize that each strain may
behave differently with regards to survivability. As a
result, each potential surrogate species should be compared directly with B. anthracis in future experimental
studies.
Experiments to compare the effect of disinfectants can
also be useful for examining parallels in spore resilience.
Whitney et al. [39] reviewed many of the studies that
have performed disinfectant trials on B. anthracis. Brazis
et al. [15] compared the effects of chlorine on B. atrophaeus and B. anthracis spores and found B. atrophaeus
survival to be a conservative indicator for B. anthracis
survival. B. cereus spores reasonably simulate B. anthracis spore inactivation by peroxyacetic acid-based biocides, but are less reliable for hydrogen peroxide,
sodium hypochlorite, and acidified sodium chlorite
[213]. Rice et al. [26] examined the affect of chlorine on
several B. anthracis strains and potential surrogates and
found that B. thuringiensis behaviour was most similar
to a virulent B. anthracis strain. However, they also
found a difference between the attenuated and virulent
B. anthracis strains, indicating that even very close

Page 6 of 12

organisms may behave differently when conditions vary.
More recently, Sagripanti et al. [40] investigated the
effects of various chlorides and other decontaminants
on virulent B. anthracis and several potential surrogates
on glass, metal, and polymeric surfaces.
Over the years many studies have focused on different
bactericidal techniques for B. anthracis and their comparative effect on survival, including ultraviolet
[44,48-50,214] and various chemicals [15,34,39,215].
Two of the ultraviolet studies were geared toward surrogate selection. Nicholson and Galeano [44] validated
B. subtilis as a good ultraviolet surrogate for B. anthracis using the attenuated Sterne strain. However, another
study found B. subtilis spores were highly resilient to
ultraviolet ionizing radiation when immersed in water
and concluded this species would be a poor surrogate
for B. anthracis [216]. Menetrez and coworkers [48]
found that B. anthracis Sterne was more resistant to
ultraviolet than other surrogates, including B. thuringiensis, B. cereus and B. megaterium. Therefore, the data
remain equivocal for choosing a stand-in with similar
ultraviolet survival characteristics.
The results from the literature search on survivability
are useful, but must be used with caution when comparing surrogates. Several authors have noted the high
variability observed between spore batches and experiments [26,44]. This variability makes the translation of
results from different researchers difficult. Stringent
testing of differences between strains can only take
place when careful experimental designs are employed,
including sporulation under identical conditions and
strictly conserved methods for purification and survival
estimates. The overall conclusions drawn from the
results of previous survivability experiments suggest that
any of our potential surrogates may behave similarly to
B. anthracis. As a result, individual laboratory testing is
also required in order to empirically validate a surrogate
choice based on theoretical considerations.

Choice of surrogate
Our goal was to examine the various possible surrogates
for B. anthracis, review the criteria for selecting an
appropriate surrogate, compare the potential surrogates
by these criteria and, ultimately, choose the most appropriate surrogate for our purposes. After examination of
the first criteria, safety of use, we are left with B. atrophaeus, B. thuringiensis, B. megaterium and B. subtilis
as potential surrogates. However, after further examination of genetic relatedness and the consequential morphological differences, B. thuringiensis emerges as the
most appropriate candidate for a B. anthracis surrogate.
This may be a surprising choice for some researchers,

Table 4 Gaps in our knowledge related to surrogate selection and model parameters
Gaps

Recommended action

No quantitative comparisons of spore survival on fomites

Conduct experiments using steel, laminar, plastic and other surfaces

No quantitative comparisons of spore survival in soil

Conduct experiments across soil types

No quantitative comparisons of spore survival in buffer/water

Conduct survival experiments in water or buffer

No long-term studies

Perform spore survival studies that are over a year long

Only one comparative study examining the effect of heat in various buffers

Reconfirm results

Only one comparative study with UV

Reconfirm results

Only a few studies with virulent Bacillus anthracis

Use virulent B. anthracis and compare directly to potential surrogates

also supports B. thuringiensis as a good surrogate for B.
anthracis.
We recommend B. thuringiensis as the most appropriate surrogate based upon existing empirical data.
As a result of the phenotypic similarity within the B.
cereus group it will be important to utilize a B. thuringiensis strain that has a publically available genome
sequence, such as B. thuringiensis serovar israelensis
(ATCC 35646; GenBank No. AAJM01000000). This
will allow for strain-specific markers to be identified
[217,218] which can be used as the basis for assays
that can readily detect this strain and distinguish it
from con-specifics as well as near neighbour species.
We stress that additional experimental evidence is
needed to confirm that B. thuringiensis and B. anthracis have similar behaviours. Data on spore survival
and mobility are extremely lacking and we have identified several important knowledge gaps (Table 4). We
have found only a few studies comparing spores from
Bacillus species with the goal of surrogate validation
and comparison [26,40,44,48,60]. We are aware of no
studies that provide comparative survival of the surrogate candidates in soil or on different types of fomites,
both under natural conditions and with heat, pH variance or UV radiation. In addition, there are no quantitative studies on the long-term survival of the spores
in any medium. We also find very few studies that use
virulent B. anthracis strains. The current literature
suggests that there can be differences between the
attenuated strains and the virulent strains. Therefore,
in order to truly quantify and thereby confirm that
our selected surrogate is the correct choice, we
recommend conducting additional comparative
experiments.
