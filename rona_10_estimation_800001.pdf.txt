Estimation of divergence time between two
sibling species of the Anopheles (Kerteszia) cruzii
complex using a multilocus approach

Abstract
Background: Anopheles cruzii is the primary human Plasmodium vector in southern and southeastern Brazil. The
distribution of this mosquito follows the coast of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Previous studies indicated that An.
cruzii is a complex of cryptic species.
Results: A multilocus approach using six loci, three circadian clock genes and three encoding ribosomal proteins, was
implemented to investigate in more detail the genetic differentiation between the An. cruzii populations from Santa
Catarina (southern Brazil) and Bahia States (northeastern Brazil) that represent two sibling species. The analysis revealed
very high FST values and fixed differences between the two An. cruzii sibling species in all loci, irrespective of their
function. An Isolation with Migration model was fit to the data using the IM program. The results reveal no migration in
either direction and allowed a rough estimate of the divergence time between the two sibling species.
Conclusions: Population genetics analysis of An. cruzii samples from two Brazilian localities using a multilocus
approach confirmed that they represent two different sibling species in this complex. The results suggest that the
two species have not exchanged migrants since their separation and that they possibly diverged between 1.1 and
3.6 million years ago, a period of intense climatic changes.

Background
Anopheles cruzii (Diptera: Culicidae) is the primary vector of human and simian malaria parasites in southern
and southeastern Brazil [1,2]. Earlier studies that evaluated
X chromosome inversion frequencies [3,4] and isoenzyme
profiles [5] suggest that Anopheles cruzii is a species complex. A recent analysis of genetic differentiation using the
timeless gene among An. cruzii populations from southern,
southeastern and northeastern Brazil indicated that the
population from Itaparica, Bahia State (northeastern
Brazil) is a different species [6].
In the current study, a multilocus analysis using six
different nuclear gene fragments was performed comparing two populations of An. cruzii (Florianópolis and
Itaparica), representing respectively the southeastern
and northeastern sibling species. Three of the fragments
used are orthologues of Drosophila melanogaster genes
involved in the control of circadian rhythms: timeless

(tim), Clock (Clk) and cycle (cyc); and three code for
ribosomal proteins: Rp49 (Ribosomal protein 49, known
also as RpL32 - Ribosomal protein L32), RpS2 (Ribosomal protein S2) and RpS29 (Ribosomal protein S29).
The aim of the study was to determine if there is still
gene flow between the two sibling species and to estimate their divergence time. Furthermore, circadian
genes [7] putatively involved in the control of mating
rhythms [8], such as timeless, Clock and cycle, are potentially important in maintaining temporal reproductive
isolation between closely related species. Based on that,
this study also aimed to verify whether the differentiation in circadian genes is higher than the divergence in
constitutive loci, such as the ribosomal protein genes
Rp49, RpS29 and RpS2.

within the studied loci. In order to fulfill this requirement,
the optimal recombination-filtered block was extracted
from each gene alignment (see below). Table 1 shows the
position of the non-recombining (NR) blocks used in this
study as well as the putative recombinant sequences that
were removed (see Methods). Another assumption of the
IM program is that the variation observed in the studied
loci is neutral. Therefore, the Tajima [9] and Fu & Li [10]
tests of neutrality were used and the results are presented
in Table 2. No significant deviations from neutrality were
observed after Bonferroni correction.

Table 2 also shows the minimum number of recombination events for each gene (RM) and the length of
the whole fragment and for the NR block of each
gene (values in parentheses). The larger differences in
length between the whole fragment and the NR block
were observed for timeless and cycle and this was due
to the higher number of recombination events identified in these two genes (RM = 14 and 5 respectively).
The alignments of the whole sequences of each gene
are presented in Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
All loci include at least one intron of variable size,

RM, the minimum number of recombination events; n, number of DNA sequences of each sibling species; S, number of polymorphic (segregating) sites; θ,
nucleotide diversity based on the total number of mutation (Eta); π, nucleotide diversity based on the average number of pair-wise differences; DT, Tajima’s D [9];
DFL, Fu & Li’s D [10] and FFL, Fu & Li’s F [10], based on Eta (total number of mutations). No significant deviations from neutrality were observed after Bonferroni
correction. Numbers in parentheses are related to the non-recombining block (NR) for each locus.

except the cycle gene fragment, which was composed
entirely of an exon. Except for the timeless gene, all
base substitutions were synonymous or occurred
within introns. The few non-synonymous changes
found in the timeless gene are described in Rona
et al. [6].
Table 2 also shows the number of polymorphic sites
(S) for each An. cruzii sibling species and two measures
of nucleotide diversity: π, based on the average number
of pairwise differences and θ, based on the total
number of mutations (values for the NR blocks in
parentheses). In general, Itaparica was less polymorphic
than Florianópolis, having showed the lowest θ and
π values, as well as fewer polymorphic sites (S). Table 3
shows the pairwise estimates of population differentiation between the two An. cruzii sibling species. Very
high FST values (ranging from ~0.6 to 0.9) were found
between Florianópolis and Itaparica using both the
whole fragment as well as the NR blocks for all loci.
Table 3 also shows the average number of nucleotide
substitutions per site (Dxy), the number of net nucleotide substitutions per site between species (Da) and the
distribution of the four mutually exclusive categories of
segregating sites observed in each comparison: the number of exclusive polymorphisms for each species (S1 and
S2), the number of shared polymorphisms (Ss) and the
number of fixed differences (Sf ). The timeless and the
cycle loci were the only ones that shared polymorphisms
between Florianópolis and Itaparica, albeit they were
few (7 and 1 for the whole fragment, respectively). All
loci presented a large number of fixed differences
between the two species (Table 3).
Estimation of Demographic Population Parameters

The IM program was used to simultaneously estimate
six demographic parameters (θ1, θ2, θA, t, m1, m2) from
the two An. cruzii sibling species through an “Isolation
with Migration” model using multiple loci [11]. As mentioned above, only the NR blocks were used and some

recombining sequences were removed before the IM
analysis (Table 1).
Figure 1 shows the posterior probability distributions
for each of the six demographic parameters estimated
using IM and Additional file 7 summarizes the features
from the marginal histograms for each of the parameters
in all MCMC runs. Among four independent runs, the
simulations between the two sibling species showed
good convergence and consistency resulting in complete
posterior distributions.
The estimates of θ suggest that the effective population
size of the ancestral population is smaller than the current Florianópolis and Itaparica populations indicating
that both may have had a history of growth since separation (Figure 1). The migration rates in both directions for
all combined loci were also estimated by the IM software
(m 1 and m2 ). No indication of migration was found in
either direction in the multiple simulations.
The divergence time parameter was estimated for all
combined loci in four different IM runs. This parameter cannot be directly converted to years because
the mutation rates in Anopheles cruzii species are
unknown. Therefore, an estimate of the divergence
time between Anopheles cruzii species was performed
using the average of Drosophila synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates for several nuclear
genes (0.0156 and 0.00191 per site per million year
respectively) [12]. Using this approach and based on
the average of HiSmth values, an estimate of the divergence time between Florianópolis and Itaparica would
be approximately 2.4 Mya (range from 1.1 to 3.6 Mya,
based on the average of HPD90Lo and HPD90Hi
values).
Another manner of estimating the divergence time
between these two Anopheles species is to use the same
Drosophila synonymous substitution rate mentioned
above and the average Da values from the six loci
(Table 3). Based on these values, the divergence time
between the populations from Florianópolis and

Figure 1 Posterior probability distributions of demographic parameters. Posterior probability distributions for each of the six demographic
parameters estimated using IM: effective population size for an ancestral and two descendent populations (theta), divergence time between
Florianópolis and Itaparica, and migration rates in both directions. Four IM simulations (a, b, c and d) using different seed numbers were plotted
for each parameter estimate (see also Additional file 7). All curves are shown including the range of the priors.

Itaparica was estimated to be 1.91 ± 0.76 Mya and
1.93 ± 0.65 Mya for the whole sequence and NR blocks,
respectively.
Genealogy analysis

Gene trees of the sequences from all loci for both whole
sequences and NR blocks were estimated using the
Neighbor-Joining method (NJ) (Figures 2 and 3, and
Additional files 8 and 9, respectively). The most suitable
model selected using Modeltest 3.7 [13] was Kimura 2parameter [14] for all loci except for the Clock gene
where the Jukes and Cantor [15] model was chosen. All
trees were performed with 1,000 bootstrap replicates.
The resulting NJ trees clearly grouped the sequences
from the two sibling species in different clusters with
high bootstrap values in most cases.

Discussion
The results presented here confirm the high level of differentiation between the Itaparica and Florianópolis sibling species of the An. cruzii complex [5,6].
Less differentiation might have been expected in the
three genes that code for the highly conserved ribosomal
proteins (Rp49, RpS29 and RpS2) than in loci possibly
involved in the control of mating rhythms (timeless,
Clock and cycle) [7,8]. The latter three genes are potentially important in maintaining temporal reproductive
isolation between closely related species, and might be
involved in the speciation process in some insects. In
fact, Rona et al. [6] showed very high differentiation
between Itaparica and the more southern Brazilian
populations, including Florianópolis, using the timeless
gene as a molecular marker.

sibling species obtained with Jukes and Cantor distance for Clock gene, and Kimura 2-parameter distance for the others. Numbers on the nodes
represent the percentage bootstrap values based on 1,000 replications. Flo: Florianópolis; Bah: Itaparica.

However, very high FST values were detected in all loci
between these two sibling species and they were even
higher for Rp49, RpS29 and RpS2 (0.8854, 0.8865 and
0.8502, respectively for the whole fragment) than for
timeless, Clock and cycle (0.8150, 0.7088 and 0.5806,
respectively for the whole fragment). Mazzoni et al. [16]
found similar results in a multilocus analysis between
two sand fly vectors of leishmaniasis.
No indication of migration was found in either direction in the multiple IM simulations, which was consistent with the very high differentiation values for all loci.
Itaparica also presented lower levels of variability than
those from Florianópolis, possibly indicating a smaller
population size. This is confirmed by IM results, which
also indicated a smaller effective population size for Itaparica. The estimated difference in population sizes
seems coherent, since the southern An. cruzii sibling

species found in Florianópolis is distributed throughout
most of the southern and southeastern Brazilian Atlantic
Forest (from Santa Catarina to Espírito Santo State)
while the northeastern sibling species found in Itaparica
seems to occur only in a more restricted region [6].
The multilocus results corroborate previous data [5,6]
indicating that these populations represent two different
species in the An. cruzii complex. This was also confirmed by NJ trees, which show that Florianópolis and
Itaparica are clearly separated in two isolated groups,
except perhaps in the case of cycle which suggests persistence of ancestral polymorphisms in Florianópolis.
However, this gene fragment presents a very small number of variable sites in the Itaparica sample.
The estimated divergence time from 1.1 to 3.6 Mya,
based on the IM results, corresponds to the end of the
Pliocene and beginning of the Pleistocene [17].

Significant climate changes, including the onset of heavy
Northern Hemisphere glaciation, around 2.75 Mya,
occurred at the end of the Pliocene [18]. A very important consequence of this cooling was an extensive
increase in aridification, which lead to fragmentation of
forests, including the Brazilian Atlantic Forest [18,19].
Interestingly, Carnaval et al. [20] discussed the hypothesis of refugia for neotropical species occurring in the
Atlantic Forest. Itaparica is located in an area proposed
to be a large central refugium in the Brazilian Atlantic
Forest and another refugium is proposed in the southern
and southeastern Brazil. Climate changes have been proposed to explain the differentiation among many groups

such as fruit flies [21], insect vectors [22] as well as many
forest-obligate species [20,23-25]. Since An. cruzii is
endemic to the Atlantic Forest, it seems likely that differentiation between its populations might have occurred
due to forest fragmentation, which might have split a single ancestral species into two or more isolated groups.

Conclusions
The results of the multilocus analysis corroborate previous data indicating that Florianópolis and Itaparica
represent two different species of the An. cruzii complex
and suggest that they have not exchanged migrants
since their separation between 1.1 and 3.6 Mya.

Methods
Molecular analysis

The mosquitoes used in this study were females captured in Florianópolis, Santa Catarina State (SC) (27°
31’S/48°30’W) and Itaparica Island (Jaguaripe), Bahia
State (BA) (13°05’S/38°48’W). They were identified on
the basis of their morphology according to Consoli and
Lourenço-de-Oliveira [26]. For the molecular analysis,
12 individuals from Florianópolis and 12 to 14 from Itaparica were used for each gene.
The sequences of the timeless gene from Florianópolis
and Itaparica were those previously published by our
group [6] (Accession numbers: FJ408732 - FJ408865).
The sequences of the other genes were obtained by
PCR, cloning and sequencing as described below.
The primers listed in Table 4 were used with An. cruzii genomic DNA extracted according to Jowett [27] in
PCR reactions carried out in an Eppendorf Mastercycler®
thermocycler using the proofreading Pfu DNA polymerase (Biotools). PCR products were purified and cloned
using either Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen) or pMOS Blue vector blunt-ended cloning kit (GE
Healthcare). Sequencing of positive clones was carried
out in an ABI Prism 3730 DNA sequencer at the
Oswaldo Cruz Institute using the ABI Prism Big Dye
Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit
(Applied Biosystems). The identity of the cloned

Clock genes. Sequence of these fragments allowed the design of the specific
primers used in the population genetics analysis.

fragments was determined by BlastX analysis using GenBank [28].
At least eight clones were sequenced for each mosquito. Sequences were edited and in most cases consensus sequences representing the two alleles were
generated. In a number of individuals only one haplotype was observed among the eight sequences and in
these cases mosquitoes were classified as homozygotes.
The probability of incorrectly classifying a heterozygote
as a homozygote individual with this procedure is less
than 1%. The sequences from homozygote mosquitoes
were duplicated prior to analysis. However, when carried
out without duplicating homozygote sequences, the analysis rendered similar results. Sequences were submitted
to GenBank (Accession numbers: GU016330GU016569).
DNA sequence analysis

The sequences were aligned using ClustalX software
[29] and population genetics analysis was carried out
using DNASP4.0 [30] and PROSEQ v 2.91 [31] softwares.
The Modeltest version 3.7 [13] was used with a model
block implemented in PAUP 4.0d105 [32] to find the
most suitable model for each gene evolution. Models
selected by the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
were favored and used in the phylogenetic analysis, carried out using MEGA 4.0 [33].
The IM program is an implementation of the Isolation
with Migration model and is based on the MCMC
(Markov Chain Monte Carlo) simulations of genealogies
[11,34]. It simultaneously estimates six demographic
parameters from multilocus data: effective population
size for an ancestral and two descendent populations
(θ A , θ 1 , and θ 2 , respectively), divergence time (t) and
migration parameters in both directions (m1 and m2).
Initial IM runs were performed in order to establish
appropriate upper limits for the priors of each demographic parameter. These preliminary simulations generated marginal distributions that facilitated the choice of
parameter values used in the final IM analyses. The convergence was assessed through multiple long runs (four
independent MCMC runs with different seed numbers
were carried out with at least 30,000,000 recorded steps
after a burn-in of 100,000 steps) and by monitoring the
ESS values, the update acceptance rates and the trend
lines.
The Infinite Sites model [35] was chosen as the mutation model in the IM simulations because the two species are closely related and all genes are nuclear.
The optimal recombination-filtered block was
extracted from each gene alignment using the IM GC
program, which also removes haplotypes that represent
likely recombinant sequences [36,37].
