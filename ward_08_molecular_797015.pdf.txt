Abstract
Background: Comparisons of functionally important changes at the molecular level in model
systems have identified key adaptations driving isolation and speciation. In cichlids, for example,
long wavelength-sensitive (LWS) opsins appear to play a role in mate choice and male color
variation within and among species. To test the hypothesis that the evolution of elaborate
coloration in male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) is also associated with opsin gene diversity, we
sequenced long wavelength-sensitive (LWS) opsin genes in six species of the family Poeciliidae.
Results: Sequences of four LWS opsin genes were amplified from the guppy genome and from
mRNA isolated from adult guppy eyes. Variation in expression was quantified using qPCR. Three
of the four genes encode opsins predicted to be most sensitive to different wavelengths of light
because they vary at key amino acid positions. This family of LWS opsin genes was produced by a
diversity of duplication events. One, an intronless gene, was produced prior to the divergence of
families Fundulidae and Poeciliidae. Between-gene PCR and DNA sequencing show that two of the
guppy LWS opsins are linked in an inverted orientation. This inverted tandem duplication event
occurred near the base of the poeciliid tree in the common ancestor of Poecilia and Xiphophorus.
The fourth sequence has been uncovered only in the genus Poecilia. In the guppies surveyed here,
this sequence is a hybrid, with the 5' end most similar to one of the tandem duplicates and the 3'
end identical to the other.
Conclusion: Enhanced wavelength discrimination, a possible consequence of opsin gene
duplication and divergence, might have been an evolutionary prerequisite for color-based sexual
selection and have led to the extraordinary coloration now observed in male guppies and in many
other poeciliids.

Background
Understanding the molecular basis of characters shaped
by selection is a major goal of evolutionary genetics. Of
particular interest are genes that encode conspicuous secondary sexual traits in males and the genes that influence
female preference for such traits [1]. Among fish; sticklebacks (genus Gasterosteus), cichlids, and poeciliids,
including the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) and swordtails
(genus Xiphophorus), are the most important models for
the study of sexual selection driven by female choice. In
each of these taxa, female mate choice is influenced by
male coloration and in each group, male coloration and
female preference have a genetic basis [2-6].
Mapping studies designed to uncover genes responsible
for species- and population-level color variation in cichlids and sticklebacks are underway [7] but to date none
have been identified. While it is also the case that no
female preference loci have been uncovered in fish, many
cichlid species and some populations possess unique
opsin genes that provide strong candidates. Indeed, the
only DNA sequences that have been found to differ
among the 200 to 500 endemic Lake Victoria haplochromine species are long wave-sensitive (LWS) opsins
[8,9]. In the cichlid genus Pundamilia, LWS opsin
sequence and expression appears to be tuned to specific
male color morphs [10]. Thus, it appears that variation in
LWS opsin genes influences female mate choice and speciation in this family [11].
Opsin genes encode membrane-bound receptors that are
expressed primarily in rod and cone cells of the retina.
Each opsin protein is associated with a chromophore and
when exposed to light, this complex changes shape leading to rod or cone cell hyperpolarization [12]. The detection of light at the receptor level requires input from just
one type of opsin-chromophore receptor. However, discriminating among colors (wavelengths) involves the
interpretation of signals from multiple adjacent retinal
cone cells expressing different opsins. These different
opsins often have names that reflect the wavelength of
light to which they are most sensitive. For instance, short
wave-sensitive (SWS), middle wave-sensitive (MWS), and
long wave-sensitive opsins (LWS) are most sensitive to
blue, green and red light, respectively. Gene duplication
and divergence has generated this opsin diversity. For
example, the human MWS opsin is a duplicate (or paralog) of the LWS opsin locus and now differs at three of the
five amino acid positions known to influence wavelength
sensitivity [13-16]. Zebrafish also have a pair of LWS
opsin genes with different five key-site haplotypes [17].
The purpose of this study was to characterize LWS opsin
gene sequence variation in guppies and in closely related
species. We focused on this gene because microspectro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/210

photometry (MSP) data indicated that guppies express
more than one type of LWS opsin [18,19] and because
orange is an important component of female mate choice
for these fish [4,20-22]. While two recent studies have
reported LWS opsin gene variation in guppies [23,24],
one focused only on short amplicons from a single fish
and both presented incomplete data on the key-site
amino acids known to influence spectral sensitivity.
Genomic sequences, transcript expression levels, and data
from other poeciliids have also not been reported to date.
We show that guppies (Poecilia reticulata) and three species in the guppy sister group (Micropoecilia) have four
LWS genes. Sequence variation at the five key sites indicates that three of these LWS opsins are most sensitive to
different wavelengths of light providing Poecilia with a
larger repertoire of LWS pigments than any other fish
taxon. One of the guppy LWS opsins appears to be a single-exon gene, likely arising from a retrotransposition
event. This gene was sequenced in all poeciliids surveyed
except Tomeurus gracilis and has also been reported in the
killifish, Lucania goodei (family Fundulidae). Two LWS
opsins are linked, oriented in a tail-to-tail fashion, and
separated by approximately 3.3 Kbp. The fourth is found
only in the genus Poecilia. This is a hybrid or mosaic
sequence in the guppies surveyed here from Cumaná Venezuela. All four LWS opsins in the guppy were amplified
from RNA isolated from adult eyes, but qPCR experiments
show much variation among these duplicates in the level
of expression.

Methods
Genomic PCR and sequencing
All species surveyed are in the family Poeciliidae. Long
wave-sensitive (LWS) opsin genes were amplified from
DNA isolated from Tomeurus gracilis (one individual),
Xiphophorus pygmaeus (one individual), and from four species in the genus Poecilia: P. reticulata (14 individuals), P.
picta (four individuals) P. parae (three individuals) and P.
bifurca (three individuals). The genus Tomeurus is the sister
group to a clade that includes Poecilia and Xiphophorus,
and most other poeciliids [25,26]. Poecilia picta, P. parae,
and P. bifurca, occur in the sister taxon to the guppy [27].
They were in a separate genus previous to Rosen and Bailey's [28] revision of the poeciliids and we refer to them
collectively as Micropoecilia. Poecilia reticulata (the
guppy) was sampled from a population collected in
Cumaná, Venezuela and bred in our laboratory aquarium.
The Cumaná guppy has also been referred to as Endler's
guppy, but is closely related to other guppy populations
[29]. PCR reactions were run using genomic DNA isolated
from fish euthanized with buffered MS222 (Sigma®
A5040) or from specimens preserved in 95% ethanol.

Initially, PCR and sequence data were obtained using
primers ForBeg, Fw1a and Rev5, which are complementary to conserved regions of fish LWS opsin genes in exon
I (ForBeg), exon II (Fw1a), and exon V (Rev5) (see Additional files 1 and 2). After uncovering multiple LWS opsin
sequences in Poecilia, we attempted to PCR-amplify DNA
between guppy opsin genes. The between-gene PCR experiment was initiated because LWS opsins occur in tandem
in human, zebrafish, and medaka. It employed the reverse
complement of a forward primer close to the 5' end of the
gene (Fw1a Comp) and the reverse complement of a
reverse primer close to the 3' end of the gene (Rev8
Comp). Sequence data from amplicons derived from
primers ForBeg, Fw1a and Rev5, and the success of
between-gene PCR allowed us to develop gene-specific
primers, including reverse primers complementary to 3'
UTR sequences. Primers complementary only to guppy
LWS 'variant 6' were designed from sequence data recently
published by Weadick and Chang [24]. PCR amplicons
were cut and purified from agarose gels using a QIAquick®
Gel Extraction Kit and were cloned using the pGEM® – T
Easy Vector System II kit (Promega™). Sequencing of
insert-positive clones utilized labeled M13 forward and
reverse primers and a LI-COR sequencer at the Centre for
Biomedical Research at the University of Victoria. A list of
PCR primer sequences, PCR reaction conditions and a
primer map can be found in Additional file 1, Additional
file 2, and Additional file 3, respectively.
Southern Blot Hybridization
DNA from one lab-reared Cumaná guppy was extracted
using a Qiagen® DNeasy Tissue Kit and digested with the
four-cutter restriction enzyme BfaI (New England
Biolabs®). 423 bp DIG labeled probes were prepared from
guppy genomic DNA using the PCR DIG Probe Synthesis
Kit (Roche®) and primers Fw100 and Rev4 (see Additional
file 1). The amplicons from this PCR reactions were purified using the QIAquick® Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen®). BfaI
does not cut any of the LWS opsins in the region complementary to the probes. Southern blot hybridization was
carried out using a modified protocol from the Roche®
DIG application manual for filter hybridization. Digested
DNA was blotted onto a Bio-Rad™ Zeta-Probe® Blotting
membrane using the Bio-Rad™ Model 785 Vacuum Blotter. This was followed by UV exposure (120 mJ) and probe
hybridization at 40°C overnight. The blot was washed in
2× SSC at room temperature and then in 1× SSC at 65°C
and visualized using the DIG Luminescent Detection Kit
for Nucleic Acids (Roche®).
LWS opsin gene expression using RT-PCR
Prior to quantitative PCR (qPCR) experiments (see below)
we tested the hypothesis that all four LWS opsin loci were
expressed using reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. Three
guppies were euthanized in buffered MS222. A single eye

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/210

from each individual was placed in 1.0 mL PureZOL™
(Bio-Rad®) with 3 mm tungsten carbide beads and
homogenized for five minutes in a Retsch MM301 Mixer
Mill. Total RNA was extracted using the Aurum™ Total
RNA Fatty and Fibrous Tissue kit from BioRad®. The
iScript™ kit (Bio-Rad®) was used to generate singlestranded cDNA. LWS opsin transcripts were PCR amplified and cloned using the pGEM® – T Easy Vector System
II kit (Promega™) and then sequenced with labeled M13
primers. Primers reported by Meyer and Lydeard [25] that
amplify XSrc were used as a positive control. Primer
sequences and PCR conditions can be found in Additional
files 1 and 2.
Quantitative PCR
Data from cichlids and zebrafish indicate that cone opsin
expression is highest at the end of the day [30,31]. Guppies were maintained in a 14:10 hr light and dark cycle
and qPCR experiments were performed on cDNA samples
obtained from three fish in the last hour of the subjective
day. Total RNA was extracted from the eyes of these fish
(one adult male and two adult females) using the Retsch
MM301 Mixer Mill and the Aurum™ Total RNA Fatty and
Fibrous Tissue kit from BioRad®. Synthesis of cDNA for
qPCR experiments utilized the SuperScript™ III FirstStrand Synthesis SuperMix kit for qRT-PCR (Invitrogen™)
and 1 μg of total RNA from the three samples. To determine the concentration of each transcript in the three
cDNA samples, we used the Invitrogen™ SYBR® GreenER™
qPCR SuperMix Universal kit to prepare triplet qPCR reactions. qPCR was carried out in a Stratagene® Mx4000® Multiplex Quantitative PCR machine with the following
locus-specific primer pairs: a/sExon2 and LWS1IntRev;
A180SpecFwd and rev8; pExon2 and LWS2IntRev; and
fw100 plus revA (see Additional file 1). A 1:10 ROX Reference Dye normalized the fluorescent reporter signal.
qPCR conditions consisted of 1 cycle at 95°C (9 minutes);
50 cycles of 95°C (15 seconds), 60°C (30 seconds), 72°C
(45 seconds); 1 cycle of 95°C (1 minute); and a 40-step
melting curve analysis (initial temperature 55°C, increasing 1°C every 30 seconds). Each gene was also PCR amplified, cloned using the pGEM® – T Easy Vector System II kit
(Promega™), sequenced to confirm identity, and then utilized for qPCR at concentrations of 1 ng, 1 × 10-3ng and 1
× 10-5ng per 16 μL reaction. Ct values from these plasmid
templates were then used to generate a standard curve and
to estimate qPCR efficiency (qPCReff = [10(-1/slope) – 1] ×
100; Table 1). The plasmid template reactions were also
run in triplicate. Dissociation curves (Fluorescence [R'(T)] over T°C) and gel electrophoresis confirmed the
presence of single amplicons in all qPCR reactions.

The λmax of each LWS opsin is estimated from the spectral shift predicted by each key-site substitution. The influence of the proline residue at position 180 is not known.

BLASTp search [32] to identify homologs in the NCBI nr
database. All hits with bitscores > 300 were aligned with
one another and with the new data using the MPI version
of ClustalW [33,34]. Subsequent sequence manipulations
including multiple sequence alignments, toggle translations, hand editing, and delimitation of intron/exon
boundaries utilized BioEdit v.7.0.5.3. [35]. A short nucleotide multiple sequence alignment (390 bp) that
included coding sequences from exons IV and V was used
to determine relationships among our new guppy LWS
opsin genes and those from guppies of the Oropuche and
Quare Rivers in Trinidad reported by Hoffmann et al.
[23]: OR6-4 D09/DQ168660.1 and OR6-3 EO8/
DQ168659.1 and QUEm5 LO6/DQ168661.1, and from
the Paria River (Trinidad) guppy reported by Weadick and
Chang [24]: DQ865167.1, DQ865168.1, DQ865169.1,
DQ865170.1, DQ865171.1, and DQ865172.1. Maximum parsimony (MP) and Neighbor-joining (NJ) trees
[36], which were based upon Tamura-Nei [37] distance
estimates were reconstructed using MEGA v.4 [38]. Both
analyses utilized all codon positions. Support for nodes
was assessed using 1,000 bootstrap reiterations.
The MP and NJ analyses were repeated using an alignment
of nucleotide sequences that varied in length from 619 to
1095 bp. LWS opsin sequences in this analysis included

(Xiphophorus pygmaeus) and Tomeurus (Tomeurus gracilis).

Results
Hybrid or mosaic sequences
A large number of LWS opsin-like sequences (up to 17 per
guppy) were uncovered after cloning and sequencing the
products of PCR reactions utilizing primers Fw1a and
Rev5. These sequences included suspected recombinants,
that is, sequences that could have been generated by the
ordered concatenation of fragments of other sequences
produced in the same PCR reaction. Template switching
during PCR and/or mismatch repair of cloned heteroduplex molecules has been shown to generate such artefacts
[39-42]. To test the hypothesis that PCR and cloning
could generate LWS opsin sequences not found in the
guppy genome, we used primers Fw1a and Rev5 to reamplify DNA from a two-sequence template (i.e., two
insert-bearing plasmids). Five different sequences were
uncovered from the two-template PCR reaction; one copy
of each of the two templates and three recombinant
sequences. These two-template experiments confirmed
speculation by Hoffmann et al. [23] and Weadick and
Chang [24] that LWS opsin genes in poeciliids are susceptible to PCR and/or cloning artefacts that generate artificial hybrid sequences.

To determine the minimum number of genuine LWS
opsin sequences in our dataset we first considered variation at polymorphic positions. Two sequences (e.g., from
two different loci or from two alleles at one locus) could
serve as a PCR template for the generation of an enormous
diversity of hybrid sequences via template switching or
mismatch repair. However, among such a set of hybrid
sequences there would be only two variants (substitutions
or indels) at a given polymorphic site. LWS opsin
sequences derived from individual fish using primers
Fw1a and Rev5 included three different intron II haplo-

types and a position in exon III that was polymorphic for
three different nucleotides. Remarkably, this exon III variation translated into amino acid variation at position
180; the first of the five sites known to influence spectral
sensitivity (see below). Gene duplication is the only
explanation for the occurrence of three haplotypes in a
single individual. We set out to strengthen this evidence
for LWS opsin gene duplication by amplifying DNA
between the genes (see next section).
Between-gene PCR and sequencing
PCR using primers designed to amplify between-gene
DNA (Fw1a Comp and Rev8 Comp) produced a ~4 Kbp
product in the guppy and in the three species of the guppy
sister group Micropoecilia (P. picta, P. parae, and P.
bifurca). These amplicons were cloned in three of these
four species (cloning of this amplicon was unsuccessful in
P. bifurca) and approximately 1500 bp were sequenced
from each end of the clone insert. Each end of the insert
contained the last intron and exon of an LWS opsin gene
and approximately 790 bp beyond the stop codon. The
explanation for this sequence pattern, confirmed by subsequent PCR experiments using only Rev8 Comp, was that
this fragment was amplified with Rev8 Comp acting as a
forward and a reverse primer and that it contained the
ends of two LWS loci oriented in an inverted (tail-to-tail)
fashion. The between-gene fragment did not amplify from
X. pygmaeus or T. gracilis. In the guppy, additional primers
were designed and the entire intergenic sequence was
characterized. It was 3329 bp long, 66% A/T, and contained a short compound microsatellite; (TGGA)10(TA)9.
LWS opsins in the family Poeciliidae
Given the evidence for the artificial generation of opsin
sequence variation during PCR or cloning, and the observation that artefacts produced by template switching and/
or mismatch repair do not appear to be reproducible
[41,43], only haplotypes recovered from multiple independent PCR and cloning experiments were assumed to
represent genuine opsin sequences. Additional primers
were designed from these reliable sequences and from the
sequences obtained by the between-gene PCR experiments described above (see Additional file 3).

Initially, three different LWS opsin sequences were identified in guppy (P. reticulata). These three genes were delimited by variation at codon 180: TCT (serine), GCT
(alanine), and CCT (proline), and by unique intron II and
intron V mutations. Codon 180 is one of the five key positions that influence wavelength sensitivity [16] and the
variation uncovered here is reflected in the names we have
given to each of the loci; LWS S180 (S for serine), LWS
A180 (A for alanine), and LWS P180 (P for proline).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/210

Seven LWS S180 sequences were obtained from six different Cumaná guppies with five of these including the start
codon, all exons and introns, and part of the 3' UTR (see
Additional file 3). Thirteen LWS A180 sequences were
obtained from seven guppies. Only one was full-length
but six included sequence from exon II to the 3' UTR. The
LWS A180 sequence appears to be a naturally occurring
hybrid in the Cumaná guppy; the first five exons and four
introns are most similar to LWS S180, whereas the last
intron and exon are identical to the LWS P180 locus. As
the two regions of this hybrid LWS A180 sequence will
give conflicting phylogenetic signals, the LWS A180
sequences were truncated in the phylogenetic analyses
reported below (i.e. only the first five exons were utilized).
Seven LWS P180 sequences were obtained from seven
guppies (see Additional file 2). The ForBeg primer, which
includes the start codon, combined with any of the reverse
primers, did not amplify the LWS P180 locus. Therefore,
LWS P180 sequences spanned exon II to the 3' UTR. In
addition to the proline residue at site 180, the LWS P180
locus has amino acids substitutions at two other key sites.
In guppies, LWS P180 also possessed a variable-length
tetranucleotide microsatellite in intron III. PCR experiments using Fw100 and a primer complementary only to
Weadick and Chang's [24] variant 6 (RevA) uncovered a
fourth LWS opsin gene. While we did not amplify or
sequence the first exon or intron, we show that the rest of
this gene is intronless, suggesting that variant 6 is a singleexon gene, arising from a retrotransposition. It has a serine at position 180 (codon: TCG) and is renamed LWS
S180r (S for the serine at position 180 and r for retrotransposition). Finally, our southern blot shows four bands
(Fig. 1), consistent with the PCR-based hypothesis that
the Cumaná guppy has four LWS loci. These four LWS
opsins encode the following five key-site haplotypes:
SHYTA (LWS S180 and LWS S180r), AHYTA (LWS A180),
and PHFAA (LWS P180) and are thus expected to be most
sensitive to three different wavelengths of light [16] (Table
1).
Long portions of the four LWS genes found in the guppy
were also amplified and sequenced from P. picta and P.
bifurca. Three of these opsins, LWS S180, LWS S180r, and
LWS P180, were sequenced from P. parae. We did not
obtain the 3' end of LWS A180 from any of these three
species. Therefore the mutation producing the hybrid
sequence consistently recovered from Cumaná guppy cannot yet be mapped onto the poeciliid phylogeny. Xiphophorus pygmaeus had three LWS opsin genes: LWS S180,
LWS S180r, and LWS P180. Only one LWS opsin sequence
(LWS S180) was recovered from Tomeurus gracilis. All
sequences have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers EU329428 – EU329486 (see Additional file
2).

ant 5 clustered with the LWS P180 gene. This last result
was anticipated before phylogenetic reconstruction
because both sequences encode a phenylalanine at position 277 and an alanine at position 285. The remaining
guppy LWS opsin genes; variants 1–4 from Weadick and
Chang [24], the three LWS opsins from Hoffman et al.
[23]
(LWS_OR6-4_D09,
LWS_OR6-3_E08,
LWS_QUEm5_L06) and our LWS S180 and LWS A180
genes, formed the third clade. Over this 390 bp alignment,
these genes are almost identical (mean percent identity =
98.6%). We suspect that the Weadick and Chang [24] variants 1–4 and the three Hoffman et al. [23] LWS genes
include alleles at the LWS A180 and LWS S180 loci. This
guppy-only LWS opsin sequence comparison also
revealed that Weadick and Chang's [24] variant 5 is a
recombinant or mosaic sequence; the first 221 bp are
identical to variant 4, and the last 170 bp are identical to
our LWS P180 sequence. In our phylogenic analysis, this
gene occurred in the LWS P180 clade because the region
where it is identical to variant 4 has few phylogenetically
informative characters.

LWS opsin copy-number in Poecilia reticulata. Four
bands (labeled 1–4) correlate with four LWS loci from a single Cumaná guppy. BfaI (New England Biolabs®) was the
restriction enzyme used. A generic DIG-labeled probe was
designed to target all LWS loci (see methods). Two size
markers (given in base-pairs) are shown to the right of the
blot.

Maximum parsimony analysis of the longer multiple
sequence alignment (see Additional file 4) with the new
poeciliid sequences and LWS opsins from a diversity of
ray-finned fish produced a single tree (Fig. 2). The NJ tree
included all of the nodes from the MP tree that had bootstrap support >65% and many of the nodes with lower
support. Unlike the MP tree in Fig. 2, the NJ analysis
placed the Tomeurus LWS opsin as the sister sequence to a
clade with the Xiphophorus and Poecilia LWS P180, LWS
S180 and LWS A180 genes. This reconstruction makes
more sense than the MP tree with respect to poeciliid taxonomy; morphological and molecular data indicate that
Poecilia and Xiphophorus are more closely related to one
another than either is to Tomeurus. However, we present
the MP tree because the neighbor-joining tree also placed
the bluefin killifish LWSA gene at the base of the LWS
S180r clade and the Xiphophorus LWS S180 gene at the
base of the LWS P180 clade. The number of gene duplication events and gene losses required to reconcile such a
topology with the well-supported taxonomic relationships among these species makes these components of the
NJ topology very unlikely.

Phylogenetic analysis of LWS opsin gene duplication in
Poeciliidae
The guppy LWS opsin sequences obtained here and those
reported by Hoffman et al. [23] were added to the 390 bp
alignment reported by Weadick and Chang [24]. Phylogenetic analyses sorted these guppy LWS opsins into three
well-supported clades; LWS S180r, LWS P180 and LWS
S180 plus LWS A180. Weadick and Chang's [24] variant 6
clustered with the single exon gene LWS S180r, and vari-

The MP tree indicates that the guppy LWS opsin repertoire
is a consequence of gene duplication events that occurred
i) prior to the divergence of families Fundulidae and Poeciliidae, ii) in the common ancestor of Xiphophorus and
Poecilia, and iii) within the genus Poecilia. Mechanisms of
LWS opsin gene duplication include retrotransposition
(producing LWS S180r) and inverted tandem duplication
(producing the gene pair, LWS S180 and LWS P180). Formation of the hybrid LWS A180 locus may have involved
quasipalindrome correction [44]. These three duplication

events have provided species in this genus with a larger
repertoire of LWS opsin pigments than any other fish
taxon.
LWS gene evolution in teleosts
Relationships among higher taxonomic groups were well
resolved in the tree reconstructed from LWS opsin
sequences. There is high (>75%) bootstrap support for
monophyly of Cyprinidontiformes (the bluefin killifish
and all poeciliids), Pleuronectiformes (sea chub, turbot
and flounder), Percomorpha, and the family Cyprinidae
(goldfish, carp and zebrafish). One of the blind cavefish
(Astyanax mexicanus) LWS genes (R007) is the sister
sequence to those from goldfish, carp and zebrafish,
which is not surprising as all species are in the taxon
Ostariophysi. However, there were also two cavefish LWS
genes at the base of the actinopterygian clade (G101 and
G103). These genes might be derived from a gene produced during the fish-specific whole genome duplication
event [45]. Long Branch Attraction (LBA) occurs when
rapidly evolving sequences are attracted to the base of a
tree [46] and is an alternative explanation for the position
of the cavefish duplicates in our analysis. However, LBA is
an artefact that is usually correlated with poor taxonomic
sampling, which is not the case here.

Among LWS sequences available for all ray-finned fishes,
there is much variation at the five sites that influence spectral sensitivity most (see Additional file 4). Three different
amino acids were observed at position 180 (A, S, or P),
two at position 277 (Y or F), and two at position 285 (T
or A). SHYTA is believed to be the ancestral five-site haplotype for vertebrates [16]. Serine to alanine substitutions
at position 180 are common, but only guppies, turbot,
and the spotted green pufferfish have a proline in this
position. Lamprey, though not a ray-finned fish, also has
a proline at position 180. Amino acid variation at positions 197 and 308 are also known to influence spectral
sensitivity, however, all ray-finned fish surveyed to date
possess only H197 and A308. LWS opsins have been
duplicated at least six times in ray-finned fishes; twice
within Poeciliidae, once prior to the divergence of Fundulidae and Poeciliidae, once in medaka (Oryzias latipes),
once in zebrafish (Danio rerio), and again in the blind cave
fish (Astyanax mexicanus). Only in poeciliids and zebrafish
(and humans), has the duplication been followed by a
substitution at one or more of the key sites (Table 1).
LWS opsin gene expression
RT-PCR experiments (see Additional file 2) show that all
four transcripts were expressed at the same time in the
eyes of adult guppies. We then used qPCR to compare
transcript copy numbers. In three adult guppies, LWS
A180 was expressed at a much higher level than LWS S180
and LWS S180r (approximately 26 and 127 times greater,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/210

respectively). LWS P180 was expressed at very low levels,
with approximately 5338 times less transcript abundance
than LWS A180 (Fig. 3). The amount of cDNA in the three
samples was estimated by comparing critical threshold
(Ct (dR)) values between samples and standard curves
prepared from plasmids containing each transcript
(Tables 2 and 3). Standard curve log fit values are shown
in Table 3.

Discussion
Variation at key sites among LWS opsin gene duplicates in
Poeciliidae
The guppy (Poecilia reticulata) and species in its sister
group Micropoecilia possess four LWS opsin genes that we
have named LWS S180, LWS S180r, LWS A180, and LWS
P180. The first two genes encode proteins with the five
key-site haplotype, SHYTA, and the second two genes
encode proteins with key-site haplotypes, AHYTA and
PHFAA, respectively. Three of these genes; LWS S180,
LWS S180r, and LWS P180, were also amplified and
sequenced from pygmy swordtail (Xiphophorus pygmaeus)
genomic DNA. We found only the LWS S180 gene in
Tomerus gracilis. Serine (S) and alanine (A) are common
residues at position 180, but proline (P) is rare. This proline residue encoded by LWS P180 might disrupt the
transmembrane domain [47,48] and compromise opsin
protein function [48,49]. However, several observations
suggest that it is functional. First, LWS P180 is at least 44
million years old, as it evolved before the divergence of
Poecilia and Xiphophorus [26], and it has no other amino
acid substitutions that are expected to disrupt function.
Second, the LWS P180 locus has diverged from paralogous LWS opsins in ways that are expected to enhance
color vision; positions 277 and 285 have experienced a
tyrosine to phenylalanine and threonine to alanine substitution, respectively. These are the same key-site substitutions involved in the evolution of an MWS opsin from an
LWS opsin in humans. Third, this gene is expressed, albeit
at very low levels. Finally, LWS opsins from arctic lamprey, turbot, and the spotted green pufferfish also have a
proline at position 180 and no other substitutions likely
to disrupt protein function.

All four LWS opsins uncovered in this study are predicted
to have unique roles in color vision. With three different
five key-site haplotypes, they are predicted to be most sensitive to three different wavelengths of light. Also, despite
encoding a gene with the same key-site haplotype as LWS
S180, the LWS S180r opsin differs from all other LWS
opsins at amino acid positions known to play a role in
binding and activating transducin [24].
Southern blot experiments in our study revealed four
bands (Fig. 1) consistent with the hypothesis that
Cumaná guppies have four LWS opsin loci. Hoffman et al.

Ct (dR) values are shown for each LWS opsin transcript from three
adult guppies. Original copy number was calculated using Ct (dR)
values and the standard curve data shown in Table 3.

Two of the four LWS opsin genes described here (LWS
S180 and LWS A180) were reported in Hoffman et al.'s
[23] study of guppies from the Quare and Oropuche Rivers in Trinidad. Although sequence data reported by
Weadick and Chang [24] did not include all five key sites,
our phylogenetic analysis indicates that Weadick and
Chang [24] sequenced portions of all four loci from their
Paria River guppy. The phylogenetic relationships among
guppy LWS opsin paralogs reported by Weadick and
Chang [24] differ from those shown here. Both topologies
were produced using maximum parsimony, but by surveying more individuals, more species and by obtaining
longer sequences we have produced a larger set of parsimony-informative characters. This is most evident when
considering the relationship between LWS P180 and
Weadick and Chang's variant 5, and variant 4. The large
number of differences between variant 5 and variant 4 are
apparent in Weadick and Chang's [24] tree where maximum likelihood branch lengths have been superimposed
on the MP topology. Nonetheless, in their analysis, these
two sequences form a monophyletic group. However, the
sister sequence relationship between variant 5 and variant
4 disappears with the addition of LWS P180 genes from
other Poecilia species and Xiphophorus pygmaeus because
many of the unique nucleotides (autopomorphies) in var-

iant 5 become synapomorphies (shared derived traits) in
this larger dataset. Also, two of the three characters that
had united variant 5 and variant 4 in Weadick and
Chang's [24] MP analysis (adenines at positions 126 and
213 in their alignment), appear to be homoplasious when
compared to a much larger set of LWS P180 and LWS
S180 sequences. The origin of these apparent homoplasies
is intriguing and is discussed below.
Mechanisms of LWS duplication in poeciliids
The first duplication event that expanded the guppy LWS
opsin repertoire produced two genes that have retained
SHYTA five key-site haplotype: LWS S180 and LWS S180r.
The later duplicate is missing introns II-V and is likely a
product of retrotransposition. Partial cDNA sequences for
each gene have been reported [24] but their intron-exon
structure was unknown until now. It is not clear how LWS
S180r has retained retinal expression, although it may
occur in the vicinity of other LWS opsins (and their regulatory modules) in the guppy genome. Of interest, gene
duplication by retrotransposition has also produced a pair
of fish rhodopsin 1 (RH1) genes called errlo and singleexon rho [53]. errlo and rho occur on different chromosomes. Therefore, the observation that rho is expressed in
the retina (rod cells) [53] demonstrates that upstream regulatory elements can be retained during retrotransposition.

In medaka (Oryzias latipes) and zebrafish (Danio rerio),
duplicated LWS opsins are linked and oriented in a headto-tail manner [54,55]. Phylogenetic analysis shows that
independent mutations produced these gene pairs [54].
Our study also characterized an LWS opsin tandem duplication event. Duplication of the LWS S180 gene early during the evolution of poeciliids, produced an LWS opsin
that retained the SHYTA haplotype (LWS S180) and an
LWS opsin that evolved a PHFAA haplotype (LWS P180).
These two genes are linked, but in an inverted (i.e., tail-totail) orientation. Several models have been proposed to
explain the formation of inverted duplicates. Secondary
rearrangement after duplication by unequal sister chromatid exchange is one. Another is intra-chromosomal replication slippage in trans [56]. This occurs when the DNA

polymerase reverses direction using either the nascent
strand (intra-molecular strand switch) or opposite strand
(inter-molecular strand switch) as a template. By running
backwards, a duplicate of the just-completed sequence is
produced in an inverted orientation before the polymerase switches back to the correct template. The DNA downstream of LWS S180 has strings of adenines and thymines
(data not shown) that might have facilitated strand
switching by the polymerase during DNA replication [57].
The inverted arrangement of LWS opsins in the Poecilia
genome might make them even more prone to additional
duplication events [58]. Therefore, variation in LWS gene
number (among species or populations) would not be
surprising. Xiphophorus pygmaeus also has the LWS P180
gene. Post-duplication gene transposition or the expansion of intergenic DNA are possible explanations for our
failure to amplify DNA between LWS P180 and LWS S180
in this species.
The third and most recent LWS gene duplication uncovered in our study lead to the production of LWS S180 and
LWS A180. In the Cumaná guppy, the first five exons and
four introns of LWS A180 are most similar to LWS S180,
and the last intron, exon, and 3' UTR are identical to LWS
P180. These data suggest that in this population LWS
A180 is a hybrid gene; its formation might have been facilitated by the inverted tandem orientation of LWS S180
and LWS P180 [44]. As mentioned above, variant 5,
reported by Weadick and Chang [24] is also a hybrid
sequence, with approximately one half of the sequence
identical to the LWS S180 gene and the other half identical to LWS P180. As is the case for LWS A180 reported here
in the Cumaná guppy, the position of variant 5 in the tree
based upon the 390 bp alignment depends upon which
fragments are used in the phylogenetic analysis (i.e., it
would occur in the LWS S180/A180 clade if only the first
220 bp were utilized). As there are many more phylogenetically informative characters in the second half of this
sequence, variant 5 was placed in the LWS P180 clade
when the entire sequence was used, despite being identical to LWS A180 sequences over the first 220 bp. The
observation that variant 5 has not diverged from either of
its progenitor sequences and that it was recovered only

Page 10 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:210

once by Weadick and Chang [24] leads us to the conclusion that while both halves of the sequence can be found
in the guppy genome, their concatenation is an artefact
produced by template switching or mismatch repair during cloning.
In the larger alignment (Fig. 2), LWS S180 and LWS A180
are not partitioned into monophyletic clades. For
instance, the P. bifurca sequence that clusters with the LWS
S180 genes has an alanine at position 180. One explanation for this observation is that the P. bifurca LWS A180
sequence is an allele of the LWS S180 locus. A similar situation occurs in non-African humans where a common
allele of the LWS opsin locus (which typically has the
SHYTA haplotype) has an alanine in position 180 and
thus, an AHYTA five key-site haplotype [59,60].
The evolutionary consequences of LWS opsin duplication
in guppies
The evolutionary implications of opsin gene duplication
and divergence depend largely upon the expression patterns of these genes. In several species, the possession of a
large opsin family allows the retina to be spectrally tuned
for different environments and/or life stages. For example,
eels (Anguilla anguilla) have two rhodopsins, each tuned
to slightly different wavelengths. They express a greenshifted locus as juveniles in fresh water and a paralogous
blue-shifted locus when they return to the ocean and
mature [61]. The lamprey (G. australis) also adjusts its
spectral sensitivity by changing opsin gene expression as it
moves between marine and riverine environments [62].
In cichlids, opsin gene expression varies during development [63]. Of particular note is the observation that variation in LWS opsin sequence and expression is associated
with variation in water turbidity [9,64]. This has lead to
the hypothesis that species- and population-level differences in opsin gene sequence and expression represent
adaptations for foraging in either turbid or clear water and
that these differences in spectral sensitivity may drive and/
or maintain divergence in male coloration via sexual
selection [11]. Guppies, however, do not move very far
during their lifetime [65] and thus differential use of
opsin gene duplicates in different habitats is an unlikely
explanation for the evolution of LWS opsin gene diversity
in this taxon.

The simultaneous expression of opsin paralogs with different sensitivities might expand the region of the spectrum where the guppy possesses high sensitivity and
expand the range of detectable wavelengths. This
enhancement and broadening of wavelength sensitivity
can occur when individual cone cells express more than
one opsin gene [66] or when adjacent cone cells express
different opsins (e.g., humans and transgenic mice – see
below). MSP data in guppies showing cells with a broad

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/210

range of sensitivities in the long wave region of the spectrum [18,19] are consistent with the hypothesis that the
sensitivity of some cones is a consequence of the coexpression of different LWS opsins. By providing guppies
with a broad region of maximum wavelength sensitivity,
LWS opsin gene duplication and divergence might make
multi-colored male guppies appear brighter (more conspicuous) [67] to other guppies, but not to predators with
wavelength sensitivity limited (by LWS opsin gene copy
number) to a narrower region of the spectrum.
Expression of different LWS opsins in adjacent cones not
only improves overall spectral sensitivity, but is the basis
of wavelength discrimination. Observations from
humans and mice are consistent with the hypothesis that
opsin gene duplication and divergence can lead to better
color discrimination even without any associated revisions to neuroanatomy. Among human women who are
heterozygous at either the LWS or MWS locus, some
appear to have a pattern of X-inactivation that leads to tetrachromacy. These women see an average of 10 colors in
a spectrum, whereas trichromatic women typically see
seven [[68], but see reference [69]]. In mice, the hypothesis that extra opsin genes can improve wavelength discrimination was supported by data from females
expressing an SWS opsin and two LWS opsins (an endogenous LWS gene on one X chromosome and a human
LWS opsin on the other). These knock-in mice performed
better in wavelength discrimination tests than wild-type
mice with a single LWS gene [70].
Sexual selection in guppies favors males with more red,
orange, and yellow color patches [71-73] suggesting that
females use color diversity (chroma) to evaluate males.
This may be because males with more chroma are more
conspicuous [67]. However, the 'extra' chroma is a consequence of the guppy visual system and this conspicuousness may not, therefore, apply to predators. Finally, if LWS
opsin gene duplication improves motion detection, as
proposed by White et al. [74] then female guppies might
also be 'pre-adapted' to evaluate the well-characterized
sigmoid display, a behavior that consists of the male arching its body into a S-shape and oscillating the long axis of
the body both horizontally and vertically [75].
LWS expression in the guppy
Gene expression data will help us to test alternative
hypotheses about the adaptive value of LWS opsin diversity. To expand the range of maximum sensitivity and
enhance wavelength discrimination, it is necessary that
different opsins be expressed at the same time. All four
LWS opsin gene transcripts were amplified from cDNA
derived from adult eyes in our lab and by Weadick and
Chang [24]. However, our qPCR experiments on three
adults (1 male, 2 females) showed that most of the LWS

Page 11 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:210

opsin mRNA in the Cumaná guppy retinas was derived
from the LWS A180 gene. Human SWS (blue) cone cells
make up only 15% of the retina cone cell repertoire, yet
play an important role in wavelength discrimination.
Therefore, qPCR data showing unequal expression among
LWS opsin paralogs in three adults do not rule out a role
for LWS opsin gene duplication and divergence in wavelength discrimination in guppies, but does indicate the
need for further investigation. We are currently using
qPCR to examine LWS expression in a larger sample of
adults and in fish at different stages of development.
Finally, duplicated opsins are sometimes expressed in different regions of the retina [55,76]. In-situ hybridization
experiments are underway to test the hypothesis that different LWS opsin paralogs have unique expression
domains within the guppy retina, as is the case in
zebrafish [76].

Conclusion
Gene duplication and divergence has provided Poecilia
and its close relatives with four distinct LWS opsins; a
larger repertoire than any other fish. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that three of these LWS opsins (LWS S180r,
LWS P180 and LWS S180) were present very early in poeciliid evolution and are predicted to occur in all of the
approximately 239 species of the subfamily Poeciliinae.
Adult guppies express all four LWS paralogs simultaneously, albeit at varying levels. As a consequence of these
gene duplications, the potential for a broad region of high
sensitivity and/or enhanced wavelength discrimination in
the long-wave portion of the visible spectrum, may have
facilitated a red-orange color bias for sexual selection
within the guppy.

Authors' contributions
JST supervised the study. MNW and JST designed and
implemented wet-lab experimentation and data-analysis.
AMC discovered the LWS P180 locus and carried out the
template switching/mismatch repair experiment. KJD carried out the between-gene PCR and sequencing experiments. CRJL and GLO assisted with RT-PCR, qPCR and
sequencing of the S180r locus. FB and JST obtained all
samples. MDP and PRW assisted in RT-PCR. MNW and
JST wrote the manuscript with editing assistance from FB.

Additional file 2
Sequence data and PCR conditions for specific primer combinations used
for all six species of Poeciliidae. Primer names are given with corresponding primer number from Additional file 1. Amplicons are shown in Additional file 3 along with corresponding n value. 0.5 U iProof™ DNA
polymerase (BioRad®) was used for each reaction with 5× iProof™ HF
Buffer, 10 mM dNTP mix, ~100 ng template DNA, 0.5 μM of both forward and reverse primers and dH2O. An Eppendorf® silver block thermal
cycler was used for all PCR reactions. Each reaction included an initial
denaturation of 94°C for 30 seconds and a final extension of 72°C for
600 seconds. If >1 bands were found after gel electrophoresis, expected
sized amplicons were cut and purified using a QIAquick® Gel Extraction
Kit.

Additional file 3
Primer and sequence maps for LWS opsin loci in Poeciliidae. Large
colored boxes and horizontal bars represent exons and introns, respectively. Black and solid horizontal lines represent genomic sequences amplified using various PCR primer combinations (see legend; see Additional
files 1 and 2). Dotted horizontal lines represent mRNA transcripts
acquired through RT-PCR from cDNA samples. "n" represents the
number of times a given sequence of near perfect identity had been
acquired. Key site amino acids are shown within their respective exons.
Inter-species and individual sequence differences due to SNP's, small
strings of nucleotides, or codon selection (see discussion) are omitted and
a consensus map has been created. Yellow exons and introns are highly
similar to the guppy LWS S180 locus. Blue coloration represents sequences
of high identity to the guppy LWS P180 locus. This use of color is exploited
to highlight the hybrid nature of the LWS A180 gene in the guppy.
Finally, green coloration represents the diverged, single exon LWS S180r
locus (originally detected by Weadick and Chang [24]).
