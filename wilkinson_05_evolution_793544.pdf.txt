Abstract
Background: The relaxin-like peptide family belongs in the insulin superfamily and consists of 7
peptides of high structural but low sequence similarity; relaxin-1, 2 and 3, and the insulin-like (INSL)
peptides, INSL3, INSL4, INSL5 and INSL6. The functions of relaxin-3, INSL4, INSL5, INSL6 remain
uncharacterised. The evolution of this family has been contentious; high sequence variability is seen
between closely related species, while distantly related species show high similarity; an invertebrate
relaxin sequence has been reported, while a relaxin gene has not been found in the avian and
ruminant lineages.
Results: Sequence similarity searches of genomic and EST data identified homologs of relaxin-like
peptides in mammals, and non-mammalian vertebrates such as fish. Phylogenetic analysis was used
to resolve the evolution of the family. Searches were unable to identify an invertebrate relaxin-like
peptide. The published relaxin cDNA sequence in the tunicate, Ciona intestinalis was not present in
the completed C. intestinalis genome. The newly discovered relaxin-3 is likely to be the ancestral
relaxin. Multiple relaxin-3-like sequences are present in fugu fish (Takifugu rubripes) and zebrafish
(Danio rerio), but these appear to be specific to the fish lineage. Possible relaxin-1 and INSL5
homologs were also identified in fish and frog species, placing their emergence prior to mammalia,
earlier than previously believed. Furthermore, estimates of synonymous and nonsynonymous
substitution rates (dN/dS) suggest that the emergence of relaxin-1, INSL4 and INSL6 during
mammalia was driven by positive Darwinian selection, hence these peptides are likely to have novel
and in the case of relaxin-1, which is still under positive selection in humans and the great apes,
possibly still evolving functions. In contrast, relaxin-3 is constrained by strong purifying selection,
demonstrating it must have a highly conserved function, supporting its hypothesized important
neuropeptide role.
Conclusions: We present a phylogeny describing the evolutionary history of the relaxin-like
peptide family and show that positive selection has driven the evolution of the most recent
members of the family.

Background
The relaxin-like peptide family includes: relaxin-1,
relaxin-2, relaxin-3, and the insulin-like (INSL) peptides,
INSL3, INSL4, INSL5 and INSL6. All share high structural
similarity with insulin due to the presence of six cysteine
residues, which confer two inter-chain and one intrachain disulfide bonds. Thus, it was postulated that relaxin
and insulin had derived from a common ancestral gene
and were therefore grouped as the insulin superfamily,
which later included insulin-like growth factors I and II
(IGF-1 and -2) (reviewed in [1]).
Despite less than 50% predicted sequence similarity
across members of the insulin superfamily, primary structural determinants are retained, resulting in the similar
tertiary structures of relaxin and insulin (reviewed in [1]).
The structures of insulin, relaxin [1], relaxin-3 [2] and
INSL3 [3] are formed by the cleavage of the pro-hormone
peptide into three chains (A, B and C), removal of the C
chain and the formation of three disulfide bridges
between six invariant cysteine residues found on the A
and B chains, to produce an active protein. Based on primary sequence similarity the native structures of human
relaxin-1 (H1 relaxin), INSL4, 5 and 6 should be similar,
but to date this has not been confirmed.
Various studies have highlighted the importance of a [ArgX-X-X-Arg-X-X-Ile] motif in the relaxin B chain for interaction with the relaxin receptor and biological activity,
which is dependent upon the presence of this motif [4].
Coupled with the insulin-like cysteine bond pattern, the
presence of this motif is used to distinguish relaxin
sequences. Hence, three relaxin genes are present in
humans: relaxin-1 is found only in humans and the great
apes, its expression is limited to the decidua, placenta and
prostate [5]; relaxin-2 is the major circulating form of
relaxin in the human [6] and the functional equivalent to
the relaxin-1 in all non-primates; while relaxin-3 was only
recently discovered and shows brain specific expression
[2]. Throughout this paper relaxin will be used to refer to
relaxin-2 in humans and great apes, and the equivalent
relaxin-1 in all other mammals (table 1).

Relaxin has been well characterized in a reproductive context.. It is a product of the ovary and/or placenta in most
species studied, and has various roles in pregnancy and
parturition, which differ between species [7]. Recent
advances have revealed relaxin to be a multifunctional
hormone, with numerous non-reproductive roles
(reviewed in [1]). Of the other relaxin-like peptides,
INSL3, or relaxin-like factor (RLF), is closely related to
relaxin and is critical for testis descent [8,9]. Early placenta
insulin-like peptide (EPIL), placentin or insulin-like 4
(INSL4) is primate specific and likely to have diverged
from a common relaxin ancestor before the duplication
that led to the two relaxin genes seen in humans and great
apes [10]. Insulin-like 5 and 6 (INSL5 and INSL6) were
identified by searching EST databases with the cysteine
motif conserved in all insulin-like peptides [11,12]. Both
INSL5 and 6 peptides show higher sequence similarity to
relaxin rather than insulin and are functionally
uncharacterised.
Until recently, receptors for all peptides of the relaxin family were unknown. Given the high degree of structural
similarity between relaxin and insulin, it had been
believed that the relaxin receptor would also be a tyrosine
kinase receptor, similar to the insulin receptor. However,
it was finally demonstrated in 2002, that relaxin activated
two previously orphan leucine rich repeat containing heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein-coupled
receptors (GPCR), LGR7 and LGR8 [13]. Further studies
have shown that LGR7 is the relaxin receptor [13],
although it also specifically interacts with relaxin-3 [14],
and that LGR8 is the INSL3 receptor [15,16]. Even more
recently, another two GPCRs which are activated by
relaxin-3, the somatostatin- and angiotensin- like peptide
receptor (SALPR or GPCR135) and GPCR142 have been
identified [17,18]. More recently GPCR142 has been
shown to be the receptor for INSL5, [19] while GPCR135
appears to be the specific receptor for relaxin-3. Surprisingly, while LGR7, LGR8, GPCR135 and GPCR142 are all
Type I GPCRs, they are from different branches within this
family and are only very distantly related [17,18,20]. No
other relaxin-like peptides have been shown to interact
with these receptors [13,14,16-18].

Table 1: The relaxin-2 gene in humans and great apes is the equivalent of the relaxin-1 gene in non-primate species and will be referred
to as relaxin throughout this paper. Non-primate species only have RLN1 and RLN3 genes.

Relaxin and INSL3 have primarily been of interest as hormones of pregnancy and reproduction; therefore it was
assumed that the largely uncharacterised INSL4, 5 and 6
would share similar functions. However the discovery of
the brain specific relaxin-3, and the widespread expression of INSL5 and its receptor GPCR142 have resulted in
a re-evaluation of these assumptions and raised the need
for a new approach to investigating these peptides.

unsuccessful. A likely non-functional single copy relaxinlike gene has been found in the ovine [25]. Despite this
controversy very few phylogenetic studies of relaxin, or
the other relaxin-like peptides, have been reported. An indepth analysis analysing only relaxin-1, -2 and INSL3 in
several primates has been performed [26] and a more
recent paper has discussed the evolution of the family
without including a detailed phylogenetic analysis [27].

Relaxin evolution has confounded researchers for decades. High sequence variability in relaxins across closely
related species is a well-known feature of this peptide,
however startling similarities have been observed between
very distant species such as pigs and whales [21]. Other
studies have reported the existence of an invertebrate
relaxin, a hormone with "relaxin-like" properties has been
described in protozoa (T. pyriformis) [22], ascidians (H.
momus) [23] and tunicates (C. intestinalis) [23]. A cDNA
and peptide sequence with almost 100% similarity to porcine relaxin was isolated from C. intestinalis [24]. Contrastingly, numerous efforts to identify and sequence a
relaxin ortholog in bovine and other ruminants have been

The increasing availability of genomic data has provided
an opportunity to clarify the area of relaxin evolution
using phylogenetic analysis. The relaxin-like peptide family phylogeny shows relaxin-3 is likely to be the ancestral
relaxin, emerging prior to the divergence of fish, presumably with a function in the brain. Multiple relaxin-3
sequences are present in the fish and frogs, while the phylogeny also suggests that a relaxin with reproductive functions is present in these lineages. However, relaxin has
been lost in the chicken and its genome instead contains
two relaxin-3-like sequences. Evolutionary rate analysis
shows positive Darwinian selection to be driving the most

recent members of the family, INSL6, INSL4 and relaxin1.

Results
Sequence similarity searches and multiple alignment
Table 2 outlines the relaxin-like peptide sequences used in
these phylogenetic analyses, from human, mouse, rat,
dog, chimpanzee, pig, chicken, wallaby, R. esculenta, X.
tropicalis, X. laevis, fugu fish, zebrafish, rhesus monkey and
rainbow trout. New sequences identified during similarity
searches have been highlighted. The source of each newly
identified sequence is annotated as a footnote (i.e.
genomic, ESTs). It should be noted that more mammalian
relaxin and INSL3 sequences have been identified than
were included in these analyses. Inclusion of these
sequences did not improve the accuracy of the phylogeny,
and as the aim of this study was to determine the evolutionary history of the entire family, they were omitted. All
available non-mammalian relaxin-like sequences with
accompanying nucleotide sequences were included.

Searches of the completed human, mouse and rat
genomes did not identify any novel relaxin-like peptides,
however, likely non-functional INSL5 genes were revealed
in the rat and dog genomes. A sequence with high similarity to INSL5 was found (Genbank Accession No:
NW_047717.1), with a frameshift mutation in the first
exon of the gene, which introduces a stop codon, resulting
in a protein truncated early in the B chain (data not
shown). The recently completed dog genome also contains a sequence highly homologous to the human INSL5
peptide
(Genbank
Accession
No:
NW_
AAEX01024390.1). However this sequence does not
encode an open reading frame, with two stop codons
present in the C peptide sequence and one upstream of a
homologous B chain sequence. Furthermore, there was no
recognizable signal peptide or Methionine start codon
upstream of this B chain sequence and it was missing the
critical Cys-29 in the B chain.
Orthologs of all relaxin-like peptides were identified in
the completed chimpanzee genome (table 2). Two
relaxin-like sequences were identified in the completed
chicken genome (GgRLX3a, b in table 2 and figure 1),
both with high similarity to human relaxin-3. Comparing
the putative B and A domains of GgRLX3a and b with
those of human relaxin-3 shows them to be 81% and 75%
similar respectively (data not shown). Three sequences
with a high similarity to human relaxin-3 (73%, 92% and
90% respectively; data not shown) were also discovered in
the X. tropicalis genome (XtRLX3a-c, in table 2 and figure
1).
Sequences with high similarity to relaxin-3 have previously been reported in the fugu fish, TrRLX3a-e [27] and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/14

zebrafish, DrRLX3a [27,28] (see table 2 and figure 1).
These searches identified a sixth relaxin-like sequence in
the fugu fish, TrRLX3f, and another three in the zebrafish,
DrRLX3b-d (table 2 and figure 1). Unlike the sequences
previously identified in the fugu fish [27], TrRLX3f is more
similar to human relaxin-2 (60%) than human relaxin-3
(54%) (Data not shown). Of the zebrafish sequences
DrRLX3b and d both show 77% similarity to human
relaxin-3 in their B and A domains (data not shown).
DrRLX3c is only 60% similar to human relaxin-3 and 54%
similar to human relaxin-2 (data not shown).
Searches of partially completed genomes identified
relaxin-like sequences in X. laevis (XlRLX3), Oncorhynchus
mykiss (rainbow trout) (OmRLX3) and an INSL4 ortholog
in the rhesus monkey (table 2 and figure 1). While
OmRLX3 shows high similarity to human relaxin-3 (76%,
data not shown), XlRLX3 is less similar (69%, data not
shown).
The presence of a relaxin gene in ruminants could not be
determined due to the incomplete bovine genomic data
currently available. No bovine ESTs with a similarity to
relaxin were found and the presence of a bovine
equivalent to the ovine likely non-functional genomic
relaxin sequence could not be confirmed. However, a
bovine EST was identified (BI682322) with high similarity to human relaxin-3 (79% identity to the translated EST
product) starting from the end of the B chain (45F in the
human pro-hormone sequence).
Searches of invertebrate genomic and EST databases failed
to identify a relaxin-like gene in any invertebrate or
prokaryote. Although a C. intestinalis relaxin-like cDNA
sequence has previously been reported [24], our searches
failed to confirm this finding. The published relaxin
sequence could not be found in the completed C. intestinalis genome.
The B and A chains from all relaxin-like peptides identified in the following species: human, chimpanzee, rhesus
monkey, pig, mouse, rat, wallaby, chicken, fugu fish,
zebrafish, rainbow trout,R. esculenta, X. laevis and X. tropicalis were aligned using ClustalW and edited to remove all
gaps, which are problematic in phylogenetic analysis (figure 1). Only the six cysteine residues responsible for conferring structure are conserved across all the relaxin-like
peptides. Striking identity is seen amongst relaxin-3
sequences, especially in the B chain. Much lower similarity is seen amongst relaxin sequences, apart from the
cysteine motif, only the relaxin-specific B chain motif is
conserved. C peptide sequences show only negligible similarity between even closely related species making them
impossible to align accurately. The C peptide is cleaved
from the mature form of relaxin-1, 3 and INSL3, is

believed to be cleaved from the mature form of all other
relaxin-like peptides and was therefore excluded from all
sequences.
Phylogeny of the relaxin-like peptide family
The alignment of B and A domains described above (figure 1) was used to construct phylogenetic trees with the
maximum parsimony (MP), neighbour-joining (NJ) and
maximum likelihood (ML) methods. MP and NJ methods
produced conflicting trees, both with low bootstrap support for most of the major branches, and the ML tree
failed to resolve many relationships (data not shown).
Based on the relationships that could be determined with
a degree of confidence, the sequences were divided into
two clusters to be analysed separately (as shown in figure
1). Cluster A contained relaxin-3 and INSL5 sequences,
while cluster B contained relaxin-1, relaxin-2, INSL3,
INSL4 and INSL6 sequences. Several fish and frog
sequences with lower sequence similarity to relaxin-3
(DrRLX3c, TrRLX3f, XlRLX3 and XtRLX3, figure 1) were
grouped with cluster B based on preliminary phylogenetic
analysis (data not shown). These sequences have, therefore, been listed as relaxin homologs rather than relaxin 3
(table 2). Also placed in cluster B are the sequences previously isolated from the tammar wallaby, MeRLX, [29] and
edible frog, ReRLX [30]. Despite sequence similarity to
relaxin-3, previous functional characterization and
expression profiles of MeRLX and ReRLX indicates they
are relaxin, rather than relaxin-3 homologs.

None of the tree construction methods employed was
able to completely resolve the phylogeny of either cluster.
Bootstrap values in the MP and NJ generated trees were
very low (below 50%, data not shown) and Tree-Puzzle
failed to resolve the position of several sequences. This is
primarily because of the short sequences used, as the C
peptide can not be used to increase sequence length and
thus improve the output from the tree generation methods, an inferred tree was produced instead. The Tree-Puzzle tree was resolved using topologies conserved between
the MP and NJ trees and then reconciled against a species
tree using GeneTree. The inferred gene trees were then
edited to minimize the incongruence (the number of

inferred cluster A Additional file 1 and the cluster B trees
Additional file 2 were combined to produce the phylogenetic tree of the complete relaxin-like peptide family (figure 2). Branch confidence levels are indicated on figure 2;
branches without notation are inferred only. This gene
tree was then reconciled with the species tree (figure 3).
Analysis of the reconciled tree shows a major duplication
event occurred early in the vertebrate lineage, giving rise to
two subfamilies (clusters A and B respectively). Another
duplication in subfamily A, prior to the emergence of fish,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/14

resulted in two lineages, which evolved into relaxin-3 and
INSL5 in mammals. Interestingly, several non-mammalian relaxin-3-like sequences grouped with INSL5, implicating them as possible INSL5 homologs (GgRLX3b,
OmRLX3, DrRLX3b, DrRLX3d, TrRLX3d and TrRLX3e).
The reconciled tree also shows two additional fish-specific
duplications in subfamily A. In the fugu fish genome a
third duplication has occurred, resulting in three putative
relaxin-3 (TrRLX3a, b, c) and two INSL5 homologs
(TrRLX3d, e). In subfamily B there were four duplications,
all were after the divergence of birds and reptiles and
likely to have occurred during mammalian evolution.
These events resulted in INSL3, INSL6, relaxin-1, relaxin2 and INSL4.
Synonymous (dS) and Nonsynonymous (dN) substitution
rate estimates
Results show the relaxin-like peptides are under varying
selection pressures (table 3). Pairwise comparisons of
human and chimpanzee orthologs provide the only way
to compare all members of the family between two species. RLN1, RLN2 and INSL6 have high dN/dS rate estimates, with results for RLN1 and INSL6 suggesting
positive Darwinian selection. The extremely high estimate
for INSL6 (99) is caused by having a dS of 0 (i.e. no synonymous substitutions), resulting in a division by 0 for the
rate estimate, which is represented as 99 rather than infinity. All other human and chimpanzee sequences compared were identical and thus produced dN/dS estimates of
0.

Human and mouse orthologs were used to estimate rates
for the other members of the family. RLN2 and INSL6
show the highest estimates again, although are much
lower than comparisons with chimpanzee sequences, the
INSL6 estimate suggesting weak purifying selection
instead of positive selection. The very low substitution
rate observed for RLN3 (0.02) shows this peptide to be
under strong purifying selection, at a similar rate to insulin (INS) (table 3). Rates vary among the other members
of the family from ~0.1 for INSL3 and INSL5 to ~0.5 for
RLN2 and INSL6. As INSL4 is not present in mice and the
human and chimpanzee sequences were identical, the
INSL4 sequence from the rhesus monkey was used instead
(data not shown). This comparison yielded a dN/dS estimate of 0.5, indicating weak purifying selection.
Substitution rate estimates for the individual B and A
domains were determined in a similar fashion, using
human and chimpanzee comparisons for RLN1, RLN2
and INSL6; human, rhesus monkey comparisons were
used for INSL4 and human, mouse comparisons were
used for RLN3, INSL3 and INSL5 (figure 4). These comparisons show the B domains of relaxin-1 and INSL6 to be
under positive selection (both estimates were 99). The B

domains of INSL4 and relaxin-2 also have high substitution rates (1.0 and 0.7 respectively), but are not high
enough to suggest positive rather than neutral or weak
purifying selection. All A domains are under the effects of
fairly strong purifying selection, except for that of relaxin1, which is under only very weak selection pressures (0.8).
Interestingly, while the B domains of relaxin-2, INSL6 and
INSL4 all have very high dN/dS estimates, the A domains of
these genes have very low estimates. This is in contrast
with the other members of the family, relaxin-3, INSL3
and INSL5, which all have higher dN/dS estimates in the A
domain than the B domain.
Positive selection tests
To confirm the pairwise dN/dS (or ω) estimates, more
sophisticated codon-based substitution models (reviewed
in [31]) were used. As pairwise comparisons have already
shown positive selection to be acting on RLN1 and INSL6,
INSL4 was analysed further. The phylogenetic tree of all
sequences used is shown in figure 5. Branch-specific likelihood analysis of the data, which assumes a constant ω
ratio across all sites in a sequence, was used to test
whether the INSL4 branch (branch A, figure 5) has a different ω ratio than all other branches. While the two-ratios
model indicates a ω ratio of 1.1 for branch A (table 4), the
LRT comparing this with the one-ratio model shows this
to be statistically insignificant (P = 0.6, d.f. = 1, table 5).

Site-specific models, which allow the ω ratios to vary
between sites in a sequence, were also applied to the data.

The ω ratio was found to vary considerably among amino
acid sites. The discrete model with K = 3 site classes was
the best fit to the data with a log likelihood value of 1413.8 (table 4). This model suggests that 31% of sites are
under positive selection (ω2 = 2.00), while half (54%) are
under weak purifying selection (ω1 = 0.6) and the other
15% constrained under extreme purifying selection (ω0 =
0.01) (listed in table 4). Eight amino acids are identified
as under positive selection at the 90% cut off (14H, 15L,
25G, 26R, 27H, 28R, 30D, 36V, see table 4). All but two
of these are within the A chain of INSL4. The LRT of M3
with its null model (M0) shows these results to be significant (P < 0.0001, d.f. = 2, table 5). Similar results are seen
with Model M8.
Lastly, branch-site models A and B were applied to the
data. These models extend the site and branch specific
models by allowing the ω ratios to vary among lineages
and sites and were used to test for specific sites under positive selection on the INSL4 branch. Model A, which fits
the data significantly better than its null model M0 (P =
0.02, d.f. = 2, table 5) identifies 2 sites (13K and 37I)
under positive selection in the INSL4 branch at the 95%
cut off (table 4). Model B, which allows the ω ratio to vary
both in the foreground lineage (the INSL4 branch) and in
the background branches also fits the data significantly
better than its null model, M3 with k = 2 (P = 0.007, d.f.
= 2, table 5), and identifies the same two positively
selected sites as Model A (13K and 37I) in the INSL4
branch (table 4). Model B also confirms the results produced by the discrete model (M3 with k = 3 site classes),
showing 27% of sites of under positive selection, 58%
under weak purifying selection (ω2 = 0.58) and 14%
under very strong purifying selection (table 4).

Discussion
While relaxin evolution has been the centre of much controversy (relaxin is often cited as a gene that conflicts with
the Darwinian theory of evolution [24,32-34]), this report
is the first attempt to describe the evolutionary history of
the whole relaxin-like peptide family from a phylogenetic
perspective. Previous studies have concentrated on the
primate relaxins and relaxin-like factors [26], or not
included detailed phylogenetic analyses [27]. We have
sought to expand upon these by incorporating sequences
identified in all the available completed genomes with a
subset of cloned relaxin-like sequences, particularly those
from non-mammalian species.
None of the phylogenetic tree construction programs used
was able to completely resolve the evolution of the
relaxin-like peptide family. This is likely due to variable
divergence across the family and the short sequence
length [35]. Incorporating results from the MP and NJ
methods suggested positions for several branches that

were unresolved after ML analysis. Minimizing incongruence between the gene and species trees by reducing the
number of assumed duplications in the reconciled tree
also provided a method to infer the evolutionary history
of this family.
Similarly to previously published results, searches of
available genomic and EST data failed to identify any
novel members of the relaxin-like peptide family [28].
Given the stringent and well-described insulin family signature that revolves around the invariant cysteine residues
that confer the insulin-like structure seen across the superfamily, we find it improbable that any novel relaxin or
insulin-like sequences will be identified.

The presence of an invertebrate relaxin has been of speculation since 1983 when relaxin-like activity was first
detected in the protozoa, T. pyriformis [22]. Similar activity
was reported in H. momus [23] and in C. intestinalis, where
a cDNA sequence almost identical to pig relaxin was
found [24]. However, our searches of all completed invertebrate genomes (including C. intestinalis) failed to identify any relaxin-like sequences, including the published
sequence. Multiple insulin-like peptides have been found
in several invertebrates, including: Bombyxi mori (silkworm) [36], D. melanogaster [37] and C. elegans [38]. As
these sequences lack the relaxin-specific motif, and show
no homology to other relaxin family peptides, they are
not considered part of the relaxin subfamily and therefore
have not been included in these analyses. Much of the
controversy surrounding relaxin evolution concerns the

identification of an invertebrate relaxin sequence (a cDNA
sequence from Ciona intestinalis) almost identical to pig
relaxin (Georges and Schwabe, 1999). Completion of the
C. intestinalis and other invertebrate genomes has allowed
us to conclude that there is not a relaxin-like sequence in
any invertebrate sequenced to date. If an invertebrate
relaxin does exist, it does not contain the relaxin-specific
motif characterized in vertebrates.
A hallmark of relaxin sequences is their high variability,
even amongst closely related species. Relaxin-like peptide
sequences isolated from two whales are almost identical
to porcine relaxin [21], however as these sequences were
derived from amino acid sequencing, without nucleotide
or and genomic sequence available, they have not been
able to be included in these phylogenetic analyses.
The presence of a functional relaxin in the ruminant lineage has yet to be confirmed [25]. More genomic data is
Page 12 of 17

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:14

required to confirm the presence of a non-functional
relaxin gene sequence in the bovine, similar to that
observed in the ovine [25]. Searches of the preliminary
bovine genome assembly have failed to find a relaxin
gene. Interestingly, a relaxin sequence has been identified
in the camel [39] and relaxin expression found in the
closely related llama and alpaca [40]. While classified as a
ruminant, Camelidae have a unique reproductive anatomy and physiology [41]. A bovine EST (BI682322) with
high similarity to exon 2 of human relaxin-3 was identified. Confirmation of the presence of relaxin and relaxin3 orthologs in ruminants awaits further sequencing of the
bovine and ovine genomes.
The presence of an avian relaxin has also been of speculation. While relaxin-like activity has been reported in the
chicken [42], an avian relaxin-like peptide or gene has not
been identified. While two relaxin-3-like genes were identified in the nearly completed chicken genome, no avian
relaxin gene was found. As no other relaxin-like genes
were found, the reported relaxin activity may be due to
one of the relaxin-3-like genes.
The phylogeny of the relaxin-like peptide family indicates
relaxin-3 is the ancestral relaxin, appearing prior to the
divergence of teleosts. The finding of multiple relaxin-3like genes in the fugu fish and zebrafish suggests multiple
lineage-specific duplications of a single relaxin-3-like
ancestor have occurred in fish [27]. However, the possibility the other mammal specific relaxin-like peptides
emerged earlier before being lost in the teleost can not be
excluded [27]. We find it more likely that these duplications, and the resulting multiple relaxin-3-like genes, are
fish specific and due to genome wide duplications
hypothesized to have occurred during fish evolution [43].
Phylogenetic analyses show multiple fish homologs of
both the mammalian relaxin-3 and INSL5 genes, meaning
that two relaxin-3-like genes existed prior to the genome
duplication event proposed to have occurred in the teleost
ancestor. The putative fish relaxin homolog was either,
present in the teleost ancestor, duplicated and the second
copy lost or emerged shortly after or, as a result of, the
genome-wide duplication event.
While termed relaxin-3-like based on sequence similarity,
phylogenetic analysis indicates that several non-mammalian sequences (OmRLX3, DrRLX3b, DrRLX3d, TrRLX3d,
TrRLX3e and GgRLX3b) could be INSL5 homologs. None
of the sequences found in the complete X. tropicalis
genome were placed in this group, while there are members present in the more ancient fish lineage and the
younger avian lineage. It is possible that this gene has
either been lost, or remains unidentified, in the X. tropicalis genome. A sequence with similarity only to the B chain
of relaxin-3 was also found, but a corresponding A chain

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/14

match was not, however, there is a gap in the genome
assembly upstream which might contain the missing
domain. Future assemblies of the Xenopus genome should
resolve this issue. These results suggest that INSL5 could
have emerged during teleost evolution, far earlier than
previously believed. Unlike the mammal-specific relaxinlike genes, which are clustered together (on chromosome
9 in the human and chromosome 19 in the mouse),
INSL5 is localized independently (chromosome 1 in the
human and chromosome 4 in the mouse). These findings
are of particular interest in the analysis of INSL5, which is
still functionally uncharacterised.
All the potential non-mammalian INSL5 homologs retain
the relaxin-specific B chain [RxxxRxxI/V] motif, hence
would be capable of interacting with the relaxin receptor,
LGR7, and thus functionally classified as a relaxin. Recent
studies have shown INSL5 is a high affinity ligand for
GPCR142 but not GPCR135, LGR7 or LGR8 [19]. As the
residues required for interaction with GPCR135 and
GPCR142 are not known, it is unknown whether the nonmammalian INSL5 homologs would interact with
GPCR142, GPCR135 and/or LGR7.
Phylogenetic results from this study suggest the presence
of a relaxin homolog in fish and frogs, although not in the
chicken. Relaxin sequences have previously been isolated
and peptide sequenced from either the ovaries or testes of
the edible frog [30], little skate (Raja erinacea) [44], spiny
dogfish (Squalus acanthias) [45], Atlantic stingray (Dasyatis
sabina) [46] and the sand tiger shark (Odontaspis taurus)
[47]. While having high similarity with relaxin-3, these
sequences are not relaxin-3 homologs (as the B chain of
the stingray sequence is lacking the relaxin-specific motif,
it is not a functional relaxin [46] and has not been considered further). Based on the expression of all these genes in
reproductive organs such as the testes and ovaries, and the
failure to find the R. esculenta gene expressed in the brain
using northern blot analysis [30], we believe these to be
among the first relaxin peptides with a reproductive
function. Based on the similarity with relaxin-3 observed
in these sequences, the ancestral relaxin homolog, and its
new reproductive function, is likely to have emerged prior
to the divergence of teleosts. A complete picture of relaxinlike peptides present in non-mammalian genomes will be
invaluable in understanding the evolution of relaxin from
neuropeptide to reproductive hormone.
The ancestral RLN3 gene is under very strong purifying
selection, highlighting the importance of its highly conserved function, likely to be in the brain [2]. As high divergence is a hallmark of relaxin sequences, it is somewhat
unsurprising that RLN2 is under only weak purifying
selection. We suggest that this lack of selective pressure
has contributed to the high sequence divergence seen

between many relaxins (e.g. human and mouse) and the
differences in relaxin's functions observed across
mammals.
Information about the selective constraints placed upon
these peptides, can provide valuable insight into the
nature of interactions with their receptors. Based on selection pressures we can conclude that the interactions
between relaxin-3 and GPCR135, INSL5 and GPCR142
are very specific, while the binding of relaxin to LGR7 is
much looser. In this context the cross-reactivity seen
between LGR7 and INSL3 or H1 relaxin, which are both
similar to relaxin in sequence but especially in structure, is
understandable, as is the lack of binding between
GPCR135 and GPCR142 with any other relaxin-like peptide. Unexpectedly, synonymous and nonsynonymous
substitution rate estimates for RLN1 and INSL6 show
these to be under positive selection. Positive selection is
often difficult to observe using pairwise comparisons that
average over the whole length of a sequence, making these
results even more striking. While pairwise comparisons
failed to confirm positive selection was acting on INSL4,
further statistical tests suggested that positive Darwinian
selection acted on several sites in the INSL4 sequence after
its emergence. Further analysis will be required to confirm
these sites as important in the acquisition of a new receptor and a new function by INSL4, particularly in light of
recent studies that question the reliability of ML methods
to accurately detect positive selection acting on single sites
[48-50]. We are encouraged that both branch-specific and
site-specific ML models find positive selection to be acting
on INSL4.
When the B and A domains of each gene were analyzed
separately, further differences in selection pressures
became apparent. The interaction between relaxin and its
receptor has been thought to be primarily mediated
through the B chain of the peptide [4], so the finding that
selection pressures are stronger on the A chain of relaxin1, INSL4 and INSL6 was unexpected. We also find it
noteworthy that INSL4, INSL6 and relaxin-1 are the most
recent members of the family to emerge and all appear to
be under the effects of positive Darwinian selection.
INSL6 emerged during mammalian development, INSL4
and RLN1 during primate evolution, they remain functionally uncharacterized and INSL4 and INSL6 are without known receptors. The low selection pressure on the B
domain and the strong constraints placed on the A
domain of INSL4 and INSL6 suggests that, unlike the B
chain mediated interaction of relaxin and INSL3 with
their receptors, the interaction of these peptides with their
receptors could be dependant on the A chain instead. The
low dN/dS rate observed for INSL5 indicates this peptide to
be evolutionary stable and of functional importance. In
particular the constraints placed on both A and B chains

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/14

of INSL5 suggest a well-defined receptor interaction system, while the total absence of these constraints on either
chain within relaxin-1 suggests the opposite, that perhaps
this peptide is still evolving its function.

Conclusions
We present here a phylogeny for the relaxin-like peptide
family. Relaxin has long been used as an example of a
gene that conflicts with the Darwinian theory of evolution
[24,32-34]. However, we have shown that these can issues
can be resolved when studied in the context of the rest of
the relaxin-like peptide family, in particular the new, but
likely ancestral relaxin, relaxin-3.
We have demonstrated that positive selection has been a
driving force in the recent expansion of the relaxin-like
peptide family during mammalian evolution. While
strong purifying selection has maintained the structural
core of these peptides by constraining the insulin superfamily cysteine motif, outside these residues, positive
selection has acted after at least three gene duplication
events (which generated INSL6, INSL4 and relaxin-1) to
allow these new genes to acquire a new receptor and novel
functions. Given the known roles of relaxin and INSL3 in
reproduction (and the likely similar roles of INSL4 and
INSL6 given the specificity of their expression in reproductive tissues) these findings correlate with a general
trend towards rapid evolution in several reproduction
associated genes [51-54]. We anticipate that further analysis of the coevolution of the relaxin-like peptides with
their receptors will contribute much towards our understanding of the pleiotropic actions of this family as well as
mechanisms involved in the evolution of peptide hormone systems.

Methods
Sequences and sequence similarity searches
Amino acid and nucleotide sequences of cloned relaxinlike peptide family members from the following species
were obtained from GenBank [55]: human (Homo sapiens)
H1 relaxin, H2 relaxin, H3 relaxin, INSL3, INSL4, INSL5,
INSL6; mouse (Mus musculus) relaxin, relaxin-3, INSL3,
INSL5, INSL6; rat (Rattus norvegicus) relaxin, relaxin-3,
INSL3, INSL6; dog (Canis familiaris) relaxin; pig (Sus
scrofa) relaxin, relaxin-3, INSL3; edible frog (Rana esculenta) relaxin and tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii)
relaxin (see table 2 for accession numbers). Five published relaxin-like sequences previously identified in the
fugu fish (TrRLX3a-e) [27] and the zebrafish (DrRLX3a)
[28] were also used. There are several partial relaxin-like
peptide sequences available, however only sequences
with corresponding nucleotide sequence data were utilized in this study.

Sequence similarity searches using TBLASTN [56] were
conducted using the B and A chain sequences of each family member to identify other mammalian, vertebrate and
invertebrate relaxin-like peptides. The following databases were searched: human, mouse, rat, dog, chimpanzee
(Pan troglodytes), fugu fish, zebrafish, fruit fly (Drosophila
melanogaster), mosquito (Anopheles gambiae), Caenorhabditis elegans, all yeast, all plant and all bacterial genomes at
NCBI [57], X. tropicalis [58] and C. intestinalis [59],
Expressed Sequence Tags (EST), Genome Survey
Sequences (GSS), and High-Throughput Genomic
Sequences (HTGS) databases [55]. While the classical
cysteine motif of the insulin superfamily was used to distinguish sequences as members of this family, relaxin
homologs were distinguished by the additional presence
of the specific relaxin motif [RXXXRXXI/V] in the B chain
of the derived peptide sequence.
Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
Amino acid sequences were aligned using ClustalW [60]
with default parameters. The alignments were edited to
delete the C and signal peptide sequences, leaving only
the B and A domains, which were further edited to minimize gaps and then concatenated. Human insulin was
included as an outgroup.

Phylogenetic trees were constructed using maximum parsimony (MP): implemented in PHYLIP [61] using ProtPars, Neighbour-joining (NJ): implemented in PHYLIP
using ProtDist and Neighbour and maximum likelihood
(ML): implemented in Tree-Puzzle [62]. Data analyzed in
PHYLIP was bootstrapped 1000 times using SeqBoot and
consensus trees derived using Consense. Tree-Puzzle was
run with a two-rate model of heterogeneity, the Dayhoff
model of substitution and 50 000 puzzling steps. Trees
were edited using TreeView [63].
Reconciliation of gene and species trees
Gene trees of relaxin-like peptides were reconciled with a
species tree using GeneTree [64]. Reconciled trees are an
attempt to resolve incongruence between gene and species
trees by predicting gene duplications and losses [64]. The
species tree was based on a phylogeny of model organisms
[65]. The reconciled tree was edited to minimize incongruence, primarily by reducing inferred duplications.
Estimation of synonymous and nonsynonymous
substitution rates
Pairwise nucleotide sequence alignments of human and
chimpanzee, human and rhesus monkey (Maca mulatta)
and human and mouse orthologs were constructed using
ClustalW [60] and edited to limit alignments to the B and
A domains only, which were then concatenated. Synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) substitution rates

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/14

were estimated using the methods of Yang and Nielsen
[66] as implemented in yn00 in the PAML suite [67].
Testing for positive selection
The following relaxin-1 and INSL4 nucleotide sequences
were aligned using ClustalW: human H2 relaxin
(X00948), INSL4 (L34838), chimpanzee(Pan troglodytes)
relaxin-2 (Z27245), INSL4 (BK005152); gorilla (Gorilla
gorilla) relaxin-2 (Z27228, Z27237); rhesus monkey
relaxin (A34936), INSL4 (BK005251); bush baby (Galago
crassicaudatus) relaxin (AF317625); baboon (Papio hamadryas) relaxin (Z27246, Z27224); camel (Camelus dromedarius) relaxin (AF254739); cat (Felis catus) relaxin
(AF233688); dog (Canis familiaris) relaxin (AF233687);
guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) relaxin (S85964); rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) relaxin (S45940); hamster (Mesocricetus
auratus) relaxin (S79879) and horse (Equus caballus)
relaxin (AB000201). The alignment was edited as
described previously. A ML tree was constructed from this
alignment using TreePuzzle [62] and the method of Yang
and co-workers [31] was used to test for positive selection
in the INSL4 branch. Using Codeml from the PAML suite,
several models were fitted to the data. The branch specific
models, One-ratio (R1) and Two-ratios (R2) were used to
detect lineage-specific changes in selective pressure. The
site specific models, Neutral (M1), Selection (M2), Discrete (M3) with 2 and 3 site classes, Beta (M7) and Beta&ω
(M8), were also used to test for individual residues under
positive selection. The branch-site models A and B were
used to detect positive selection in a subset of sites in a
specified branch. Likelihood ratio tests (LRT) were used to
assess their goodness of fit, by comparing a model that
does allow for dN/dS > 1 against a model that does not
(i.e. a null model). Therefore, the branch specific LRT was
R2 vs. R1. The site specific LRTs were M3, M2 and M8
against their respective null models, M0, M1 and M7. The
branch-site models A and B were tested against M1 and
M3 with k = 2 site classes respectively. Positively selected
sites with a posterior probability of P(ω>1) >0.90 were
listed.
