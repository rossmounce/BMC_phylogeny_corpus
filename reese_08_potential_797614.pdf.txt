Abstract
The evolutionary success of La Crosse virus (LACV, family Bunyaviridae) is due to its ability to adapt
to changing conditions through intramolecular genetic changes and segment reassortment. Vertical
transmission of LACV in mosquitoes increases the potential for segment reassortment. Studies
were conducted to determine if segment reassortment was occurring in naturally infected Aedes
triseriatus from Wisconsin and Minnesota in 2000, 2004, 2006 and 2007. Mosquito eggs were
collected from various sites in Wisconsin and Minnesota. They were reared in the laboratory and
adults were tested for LACV antigen by immunofluorescence assay. RNA was isolated from the
abdomen of infected mosquitoes and portions of the small (S), medium (M) and large (L) viral
genome segments were amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced. Overall, the viral sequences from 40
infected mosquitoes and 5 virus isolates were analyzed. Phylogenetic and linkage disequilibrium
analyses revealed that approximately 25% of infected mosquitoes and viruses contained reassorted
genome segments, suggesting that LACV segment reassortment is frequent in nature.

Background
In the 1970s, La Crosse virus (LACV family Bunyaviridae,
genus Orthobunyavirus) emerged as a significant human
pathogen in the upper Midwestern United States, and it is
now the most common cause of pediatric arboviral
encephalitis in the U.S [1]. LACV is maintained primarily
in cycles between Aedes triseriatus and small mammals
(usually chipmunks and tree squirrels). Aedes triseriatus
develop a life-long infection, and infected females can
transovarially transmit (TOT) the virus to their progeny
[2,3]. TOT is perhaps the most important mechanism for
maintenance and amplification of LACV in nature [4,5].

LACV has a tripartite, negative-sense RNA genome with
the three segments designated large (L), medium (M), and
small (S). The L segment encodes the RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase [6], the M segment encodes a precursor
polypeptide that is post-translationally cleaved to generate the G1 and G2 glycoproteins and the nonstructural
protein NSm [7-10], and the S segment encodes the nucleocapsid protein and the small nonstructural protein NSs
in overlapping reading frames [8].
LACV exhibits considerable evolutionary potential in
nature. There are distinct geographic genotypes of the

virus in different areas of the United States [11-14], and
there is evidence that disease severity may be conditioned
by certain LACV genotypes [13,15]. The evolutionary success of the LACV and other viruses in the family Bunyaviridae is attributed in part to their ability to adapt to varying
conditions through genetic drift (intramolecular genetic
changes) and genetic shift (segment reassortment).
Genetic drift occurs during genome replication and can
result in viral diversity and altered fitness [16]. RNA virus
replication yields multiple genetic variants, or quasispecies, which occur due to poor fidelity of the RNA polymerases and the lack of proofreading enzymes. The errorprone polymerase can provide an array of mutations,
which allows constant adaptation to and selection by
changes in the vector and vertebrate host.
Laboratory studies have demonstrated the occurrence of
genetic shift (segment reassortment) in mosquitoes that
have become dually infected by ingesting viruses of two
different LACV genotypes, either simultaneously or within
two days of each other [17]. LACV reassortant viruses can
be isolated from up to 25% of dually infected Ae. triseriatus and the newly generated viruses can be transmitted.
The potential for segment reassortment increases when a
transovarially-infected mosquito takes a blood meal from
a viremic host [18]. These mosquitoes can be orally superinfected, and can transmit the new reassortant viruses. The
new reassortants might exhibit new characteristics such as
altered host and vector ranges, new tropisms or virulence,
and thus may be epidemiologically significant [5]. Segment reassortment is apparently restricted to closely
related bunyaviruses, typically in the same serogroup [1922].
Evidence has also been presented for reassortment
between LACV genotypes in nature. For example, the
genomes of 23 isolates of LACV were analyzed by oligonucleotide fingerprinting and categorized in terms of the
degree of their RNA sequence relatedness [14]. One genotype (denoted type A) was isolated from mosquitoes from
Wisconsin, Minnesota, Indiana, and Ohio and a second
genotype (denoted type B) was isolated from mosquitoes
from Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois. A reassortant
LACV isolated in Rochester, Minnesota contained the S
segment of the B genotype, and the M and L segments of
the A genotype.
Genome segment reassortment has also been demonstrated among other Orthobunyaviruses and in other Bunyaviridae genera. Ngari virus is a newly emerged reassortant
virus associated with severe disease epidemics in Africa
[23]. Sequence analysis of the three genomic RNA segments revealed that the S and L segments were derived
from Bunyamwera virus, but the M segment was derived

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/164

from Batai virus, an Orthobunyavirus that was first detected
in Malaysia [24]. Group C Orthobunyaviruses also reassort
[25]. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Caraparu virus
contains an S segment sequence that is nearly identical to
that of the Oriboca virus and therefore is a natural reassortant virus. Reassortant Sin Nombre viruses (Hantavirus)
have been detected in rodents in nature [26] and reassortant Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses (Nairovirus) have also been detected [27].
Although genome reassortment appears to occur frequently in the Bunyaviridae family, the epidemiologic consequences of these evolutionary events are poorly
understood. In this study molecular epidemiological techniques were used to investigate the evolutionary and reassortment potential of LACV in field-infected mosquitoes
from the upper Midwest of the United States.

Results and discussion
LACV infected mosquitoes and isolates analyzed
A total of 6,791 mosquitoes collected as eggs at 151 study
sites in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa (Figure 1) were
reared and tested for LACV antigen by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Of these, 309 (4.6%) were positive.
Viral RNA was amplified by RT-PCR from one to three
mosquitoes from the selected sites listed in Table 1. Four
LACV isolates from 1960, 1978, 2006 and 2007 were also
examined in this study. The viruses from 2006 and 2007
were isolated from mosquitoes collected in the field. L, M,
and S viral RNA (see Amplicon Cloning and Sequencing)
was also amplified from the two virus isolates as well as
directly from the two infected mosquitoes. The L, M, and
S sequences from the viruses and the RNA amplified
directly from the mosquitoes were identical (data not
shown).
Rates and patterns of molecular evolution
The numbers of sequences analyzed and the number of
segregating sites in each segment are shown in Table 2.
The greatest nucleotide diversity (π) was seen in the M segment, twice that in the S segment and thrice that in the L
segment. The distributions of these polymorphisms are
shown in Figure 2. What is most noteworthy is that all
three segments had more replacement than synonymous
substitutions. In the L segment the diversity among
replacement substitutions (πa) was actually 3.24 times
larger than the diversity among synonymous substitutions
(πs). The location and amino acid replacements are listed
in Table 3. These trends suggest that some form of positive
selection is operating on amino acid substitutions in all
three segments.

evolution rate (substitutions/site/year) of each segment

Phylogenetic analysis
Maximum parsimony phylogenetic trees were established
using amplified sequences from each of the three segments. Comparison of the clades on the three maximum
parsimony trees provides evidence for the potential for
transmission of reassortant viruses by the infected Ae. triseriatus (Figures 4, 5, 6). If there were no reassortants, the
three genome segments from each infected mosquito
would have appeared in the same clade. A number of
mosquitoes contained viral genome segments that clustered into different clades in each of the trees. For example, the S segment from the sample MCBB/La Crosse/
2004 was in haplotype #2 (red), the M segment in haplotype #2 (predominantly red) and the L segment in haplotype #1 (mixture of red and blue). Another example is the
LACV RNA from the mosquito collected in NFCS/
Winona/2004. The S segment was in haplotype #3 (purple), the M segment in haplotype #2 (predominantly red),
and the L segment in haplotype #1 (mixture of red and
blue). These suggest that segment reassortment had
occurred. The distribution of the sequences in the phylogenetic trees for all three segments would be identical if
reassortment had not occurred; however, the phylogenetic
trees are highly variable when the S, M and L segment tree
topologies are compared.

and the age of the dataset (the time in years since the
sequences evolved from a common ancestral
sequence)(Table 4). The absolute evolution rate was most
rapid in the S segment, 480 times greater than the rate in
the L segment and 4.8 times greater than the rate in the M
segment. Both the M and S segments appear to be of similar ages, while the L segment appears to predate both by
~400,000 years.

Linkage disequilibrium analysis
A linkage disequilibrium analysis was performed within
and among the S, M, and L segments. Figure 7 is a heat
diagram in which low disequilibrium coefficients are represented by light yellow squares and high disequilibrium
coefficients are represented by red squares. The matrix is
read according to the nucleotide position of segregating
sites displayed along the diagonal. For example in Figure
7, the lowest square connects sites S22 (segregating site 22
from the S segment) and S86 and it is red. This corresponds to an r2 of 1.00 and these sites are in complete
linkage disequilibrium. In contrast, squares linking site
S359 with all other sites are light yellow indicating that all
sites in S are in equilibrium with S359. The triangles along
the diagonal in Figure 7 contain many red squares indicating that many sites within a segment are in disequilibrium. Thus our coverage of each of the segments appears
adequate.

Haplotype determination
The haplotype grouping system was determined through
a conservative phylogenetic analysis. The system identified three S haplotypes based on seven polymorphic sites,
five of which were nonsynonymous mutations. The three
haplotypes identified in the M segment were based on
twelve polymorphic sites, seven of which were nonsynonymous. For the L segment, two haplotypes were identified
based on thirteen polymorphic sites, twelve of which were
nonsynonymous substitutions (Figure 3).

The squares in Figure 7 indicate patterns of disequilibrium
among segments. In contrast to the large amounts of disequilibrium found within each of the segments, there is
very little disequilibrium among segments. Between S and
M there are 192 (12 S sites × 16 M sites) possible interactions but only two of these are in disequilibrium: S359
with M12 and M126. Otherwise 99% of possible interaction between S and M are in equilibrium indicating extensive reassortment between these segments. Between S and
L there are again 192 possible interactions but only two in

disequilibrium; these are S232 and L427. All other possible interaction between S and L are in equilibrium indicating reassortment between these segments. Between M and
L there are again 256 possible interactions but only two of
these are in disequilibrium: M179 with L312 and L314.
All other possible interaction between M and L are in
equilibrium indicating reassortment between these segments.
An independent heterogeneity χ2 analysis (Table 5) was
performed to test this pattern. There were 3 S clades, 3 M
clades and 2 L clades; thus there were 18 possible segment
combinations corresponding to each row in Table 5. The
observed column is the number of times that a segment
combination occurred in the 45 samples. Eight of the
combinations were in disequilibrium but 10 were in equilibrium (in bold) supporting an inference of frequent
reassortment. In total, eleven of the 45 (24.4%) samples
were in linkage equilibrium
LACV segment reassortment in nature
Both phylogenetic and linkage disequilibrium analyses
revealed that LACV RNA genome segments had undergone reassortment in 24% of mosquitoes and isolates
analyzed. This is remarkable and illustrates the exceptional evolutionary potential and genetic diversity of Bunyaviridae viruses in nature. One possible reason for this
could be the ability of Ae. triseriatus to become dually
infected. When mosquitoes ingest two different LACV isolates simultaneously or sequentially within four hours,
100% become dually infected [17]. Even at 48 hours postinitial bloodmeal, 27% of mosquitoes that ingest a sec-

ond virus become dually infected before a barrier to
superinfection develops. In addition, when transovariallyinfected mosquitoes ingested a bloodmeal containing a
heterologous LACV, 19% became dually infected [18].
These experiments suggest that dual infection can occur
frequently through both oral and transovarial infection
and therefore increase the possibility of segment reassortment in vectors. The newly evolved viruses are also efficiently transmitted [17]. These experiments were
performed in a controlled laboratory setting, but they
demonstrate the potential for segment reassortment to
occur frequently in nature.
Although the analyses demonstrate the potential for reassortment, most of the sequences used were from RNA
amplified directly from the infected mosquitoes and not
from virus isolates. The reassortment frequency detected
in this study could have resulted from analysis of RNA
quasispecies sequences in the mosquito. However the L,
M, and S sequences obtained from the virus isolates as
well as those directly amplified from the infected mosquitoes in 2006 and 2007 were identical. This suggests that 1)
the genome sequence obtained by direct amplification of
the viral RNA from the mosquito is the dominant viral
sequence in the mosquito as well as in infectious virus and
2) that the estimation of reassortment frequency was not
confounded by potential RNA quasispecies in the mosquitoes. Estimating the frequency of reassortment of
LACV in nature would be improved by analysis of plaquepurified viruses isolated from the mosquitoes, preferably
from their saliva or ovaries, which are the epidemiologically significant organs of transmission.

tional complication could have been the isolation
method. In previous studies, virus was isolated by inoculation of samples into suckling mouse brains. Cell culture
assays are likely not as sensitive. Low virus titer, titer loss
during processing, and insensitive isolation methods,
likely contributed to the inability to isolate virus from
mosquitoes.

In this regard, we were unsuccessful in isolating LACV
from most field mosquitoes. The reasons for this are
unknown; however, there are several potential explanations for this. Eggs were collected in the field and stored in
a hot warehouse for variable periods of time awaiting
shipment to Colorado. As soon as the eggs reached AIDL,
they were placed in the insectary, hatched and reared.
Environmental factors in the collection and shipping
process could contribute to loss of virus titer. An addi-

There are important public health implications of reassortment in LACV-infected Ae. triseriatus in the field. LACV
reassortants could be more virulent and could have
altered vector species and vertebrate host ranges. New
viruses could create new arbovirus cycles with potentially
significant epidemiological consequences [5]. For example, the geographic distribution of LACV is currently determined by the distribution of Ae. triseriatus and chipmunks
and tree squirrels. If a new virus established a transmission cycle that involved a mosquito species that fed more
aggressively on humans, increased human infections
could occur. If a new reassortant virus was more virulent
or exhibited different tissue tropisms, infections could
become clinically significant in both adults and children.
For example, a new reassortant virus could replicate more
efficiently in humans, resulting in greater viremia titers
and more efficient infection of the central nervous system.
Determination of the evolutionary potential of LACV
through genetic shift may permit prediction of the epidemiologic consequences of these events.
These studies illustrate the significant evolutionary and
epidemic potential of viruses in the family Bunyaviridae.
Viruses in this family have contributed inordinately to the
list of newly emerged viruses [29], and they will likely
continue to do so in the future.

Public Health Department to be at risk for infection (e.g.
wooded areas adjacent to houses with children, schools, or
playgrounds). Mosquito eggs that had entered diapause in
fall 2000 were collected in the spring of 2001. Mosquito
eggs were also collected between mid-June and August of
2004, 2006 and 2007. Eggs were collected in Crawford, La
Crosse, Monroe, Vernon, Lafayette and Iowa counties in
Wisconsin; Winona, Houston, and Grant counties in Minnesota; and Clayton and Allamakee counties in Iowa (Figure 1). Eggs were transported to the insectaries at the
Arthropod-borne and Infectious Diseases Laboratory
(AIDL) at Colorado State University (CSU); Fort Collins,
CO. Eggs were hatched immediately and reared to adults.
Immunofluorescence assay (IFA)
To determine if mosquitoes were infected, mosquito
heads were severed, squashed onto acid-washed microscope slides, and fixed in acetone. Heads were assayed for
LACV antigen by direct IFA using LACV-specific polyclonal antiserum [30].
LACV-positive mosquitoes
Viral RNA from 40 mosquitoes was analyzed, including
34 field collected mosquitoes from 2004 and six field collected mosquitoes from 2000.
LACV strains
Previously isolated LACV strains were also used in the
analysis. The 1960 LACV isolate was isolated originally
from the brain of a child who died from LACV encephalitis in La Crosse, WI and it was passed five times in suckling

mouse brains (SMB). A 1978 LACV (78V-8853) was isolated from an Ae. triseriatus mosquito from Rochester, MN
and passed once in Vero cells and twice in SMB. LACV was
isolated from mosquitoes collected in the field in WI and
MN in 2006 and 2007.
LACV isolation
The LACV-positive mosquitoes were triturated with a pellet pestle (Fisher Scientific) in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge
tube containing 1 ml of minimum essential medium
(MEM) (Gibco), 2% fetal bovine serum, 200 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 200 μg/ml fungicide, 7.1 mM sodium
bicarbonate, and 1× nonessential amino acids. The
homogenate was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 500 × g to
form a pellet.

Cell monolayers of Vero cells were grown in six-well
plates at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Supernatant
from the centrifuged mosquito homogenate (0.2 ml) was
added to one well in a six-well plate, incubated at 37°C
for one hour. Following the incubation, 5 ml of medium
were added to each well.
Plaque purification
The virus isolates from 2006 and 2007 were plaque purified using monolayers of Vero cells in six-well plates [31].
Virus isolates were serially diluted 10-1 to 10-6 and 200 μl
of each virus dilution was added to individual wells and
incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. The virus inoculum was
removed and 5 ml of overlay was added to the well. After
six days of incubation at 37°C in 5% CO2, 200 μl of the

detection solution, methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) (5 mg/ml in PBS), was added to each well.
The plates were incubated overnight and visible plaques
were picked and placed in 1 ml of MEM with 0.2% FBS for
1 hr at 37°C. An aliquot of the medium from the wells
was added to Vero cells, and the presence of virus confirmed by detection of cytopathic effect.
RNA purification from mosquitoes
The posterior half of each mosquito abdomen was individually homogenized in 500 μl of Trizol (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA), using a pellet pestle (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA), and then total RNA was extracted according to
manufacturer's instructions.
RNA purification from virus isolates
The medium and cells from wells with plaque purified
virus were removed and placed in a 15 ml conical tube
and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was removed and the cell pellet was resuspended in
500 μl of Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Total RNA was
extracted according to manufacturer's instructions.

RNA from the 1960 and 1978 LACV isolates was prepared
by infection of C6/36 cell cultures at a multiplicity of
infection of 0.01. Three days post-infection, cells were
scraped into the medium, centrifuged and cell pellets were
resuspended in 500 μl of Trizol for RNA extraction.

Phylogenetic analyses yielded three haplotypes for the S segment, three haplotypes for the M segment, and two haplotypes for the L segment. The genome position is provided
above the genetic sequence.

Amplification by reverse transcription-PCR
Portions of the LACV S, M, and L RNA segments were transcribed to cDNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and amplified by PCR using Ex
Taq DNA polymerase (Takara, Shiga, Japan) according to
manufacturer's instructions. The primers specific for the S
segment (forward: 5'-GCAAATGGATTTGA TCCTGATGCAG-3', reverse: 5'-CTTAAGGCCTTCTTCAGG TATTGAG-3') amplified a 462 nucleotide region (nucleotides
144 to 604) of the nucleocapsid and NSs genes. This
region was selected because it was the most variable
region of the published S sequences. The S segment is 984
nucleotides in length, so the amplified region encompasses almost half the entire segment. The primers specific
for the M segment (forward: 5'-CCAAAAGCAACAAAAGAAAGA-3', reverse: 5'- CTGAAGGCATGAT GCAAAG-3')
amplified a highly variable 411 nucleotide region in the 5'
half of the G1 gene (nucleotides 1585 to 1995) [32]. The
primers specific for the L segment (forward: 5'-GCATGTGTAGCCAAGGATATCGATG-3', reverse: 5'-CAGTCTTGCACCAGG GTGCTGTAAG-3') amplified a 487
nucleotide region (nucleotides 140 to 626). These primers
also were selected to amplify the most variable region of
the L segment. Primers specific for the Ae. triseriatus ribosomal protein RpL34 mRNA were used as a positive control. PCR was performed as follows: 94°C for 5 minutes,

2. Linkage Disequilibrium Analysis
Linkage disequilibrium is a measure of the degree to
which substitutions in a segment occur independently of
one another. Substitutions that occur together in a segment at a rate predicted by their independent frequencies
are in linkage equilibrium. Substitutions that occur more
or less often than expected by random chance are considered to be in linkage disequilibrium. Linkage disequilibrium also tests whether sampling a portion of a genome

Statistical analyses
1. DNA polymorphism and nucleotide substitution rates
For each segment, the computer program DnaSP 4.5 [33]
estimated π the average number of nucleotide differences
among all pairwise comparisons of sequences [34], equation 10.5]. π was also estimated separately for synonymous (πs) and replacement substitutions (πs). The rate of
molecular evolution (substitutions/site/year) was estimated using the program TipDate [28]. Tipdate analyzes
sequences of RNA viruses that have been obtained at different dates to provide a maximum likelihood estimate of
the absolute rate of molecular evolution. The program
assumes a molecular clock to estimate the date of the most
common ancestor.

equilibrium is detected when different parts of a segment
are evolving independently and sequencing a portion of
the segment may not provide a representative sample of
the whole.
A linkage disequilibrium analysis was also performed to
determine if entire segments assort randomly, thereby
suggesting segment reassortment. Segment are in disequilibrium when some combinations of segments occur
together in a mosquito more or less often than would be
predicted by their independent frequencies. The first step
is to determine the number of times segment, Si, Mj, and
