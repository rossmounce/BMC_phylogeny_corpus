Antagonistic interactions between filamentous
heterotrophs and the cyanobacterium Nostoc
muscorum

Abstract
Background: Little is known about interactions between filamentous heterotrophs and filamentous cyanobacteria.
Here, interactions between the filamentous heterotrophic bacteria Fibrella aestuarina (strain BUZ 2) and Fibrisoma
limi (BUZ 3) with an axenic strain of the autotrophic filamentous cyanobacterium Nostoc muscorum (SAG 25.82)
were studied in mixed cultures under nutrient rich (carbon source present in medium) and poor (carbon source
absent in medium) conditions.
Findings: F. aestuarina BUZ 2 significantly reduced the cyanobacterial population whereas F. limi BUZ 3 did not.
Physical contact between heterotrophs and autotroph was observed and the cyanobacterial cells showed some
level of damage and lysis. Therefore, either contact lysis or entrapment with production of extracellular compounds
in close vicinity of host cells could be considered as potential modes of action.
The supernatants from pure heterotrophic cultures did not have an effect on Nostoc cultures. However,
supernatant from mixed cultures of BUZ 2 and Nostoc had a negative effect on cyanobacterial growth, indicating
that the lytic compounds were only produced in the presence of Nostoc.
The growth and survival of tested heterotrophs was enhanced by the presence of Nostoc or its metabolites,
suggesting that the heterotrophs could utilize the autotrophs and its products as a nutrient source. However, the
autotroph could withstand and out-compete the heterotrophs under nutrient poor conditions.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that the nutrients in cultivation media, which boost or reduce the number of
heterotrophs, were the important factor influencing the outcome of the interplay between filamentous
heterotrophs and autotrophs. For better understanding of these interactions, additional research is needed. In
particular, it is necessary to elucidate the mode of action for lysis by heterotrophs, and the possible defense
mechanisms of the autotrophs.

Background
Cyanobacteria are photoautotrophic bacteria obtaining
their carbon and energy by photosynthesis, while heterotrophic bacteria rely on organic compounds as their carbon and energy source. Within their natural aquatic
environment, autotrophic cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria live in a close relationship and can
interact in various ways (synergistic, neutral, antagonistic). At present, little is known about such interactions,
especially between filamentous cyanobacteria and filamentous heterotrophs. Few studies touching those

Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 190, CH-8057, Switzerland

relationships are available, and most focus on the biocontrol of harmful cyanobacterial blooms [1-4].
In 2009, two novel filamentous heterotrophic genera
belonging to the family Cytophagaceae from the phylum
Bacteroidetes were isolated from mud in tidal flats [5,6].
Not much is known about their “behavior” or ecological
roles. Therefore, a model organism representing filamentous cyanobacteria was chosen to study their interplay in mixed cultures. Furthermore, we were interested
in the following aspects: i) the effect of these microbes
on autotrophs in nutrient rich (carbon source in medium) and nutrient poor environments (no carbon source
in medium); ii) effect of heterotrophic extracellular
metabolites on the growth and survival of cyanobacteria;

iii) potential physical contact between heterotrophs and
autotrophs; iv) the effect of cyanobacteria and their
extracellular metabolites on the heterotrophs.

Materials and methods
Bacterial strains and cultivation

We used two novel heterotrophic filamentous bacteria
isolated from a mud sample from tidal flats in Fedderwardersiel, on the North Sea coast of Germany. These
were Fibrella aestuarina strain BUZ 2 T [6] and Fibrisoma limi strain BUZ 3T [5], which were separately cultivated in 30 mL of Ancylobacter-Spirosoma medium
(SM, DSMZ 7) at 29°C on a shaker (120 rpm) for two
(BUZ 2) or four days (BUZ 3). The autotrophic axenic
cyanobacterium, Nostoc muscorum SAG 25.82 (identical
strains ATCC 27893; PCC 7120) obtained from the
SAG culture collection at University of Gottingen (Germany) was cultivated in 100 mL of BG11 medium [7] at
room temperature under continuous light (800 lux) and
shaking (120 rpm) for 21 days before starting the
experiment.
Experimental design

In the experimental set up, we tested the following
treatments [see Additional file 1]: effect of SM broth on
cyanobacterium, effect of heterotrophs Fibrella aestuarina BUZ 2T or Fibrisoma limi BUZ 3T on cyanobacterium in the mixture of SM and BG11 media, effect of
washed heterotrophs (in BG11) on cyanobacterium,
effect of heterotrophic supernatants on cyanobacterium,
effect of BG11 medium on heterotrophs, effect of cyanobacterium on heterotrophs and effect of cyanobacterial
supernatant on heterotrophs.
The mixed cultures and controls grown in preparation
listed in the next section were cultivated in four 24
wells microtiter plates (TPP, Trasandingen, Switzerland)
[see Additional file 1] at room temperature, exposed to
continuous light (800 lux) under shaking (120 rpm) for
21 days.
Preparation of bacterial cultures

Prior to the experiment, the cultures of heterotrophs
and cyanobacterium were checked microscopically for
purity using an Olympus BX 51 (Germany; 20× and 40×
objectives) and by plating on SM agar. To achieve
experimental densities of bacteria (2 × 106 cell mL-1 for
Nostoc and 107 cells mL-1 for heterotrophs), 20 μL subsamples were taken from grown cultures and filament
length was measured microscopically (4× objective for
Nostoc, 20× objective for heterotrophs) using a Neubauer-improved counting chamber (Paul Marienfeld
GmbH & Co, Germany) in four repetitions. To extrapolate cell numbers from the measured filament length, a
conversion factor of the estimated mean cell lengths of

Page 2 of 8

4.0 μm, 6.7 μm and 5.9 μm for Nostoc, BUZ 2 and BUZ
3 respectively was used from a previous study [8].
Furthermore, to obtain the number of colony forming
units (CFU) for the heterotrophs, 100 μL subsamples of
the starting cultures were decimally diluted and plated
on SM agar, incubated at 29°C and counted after 3 and
5 days (for BUZ 2 and BUZ 3), respectively.
Bacterial supernatant, cell to cell contact observations
and washing

In order to obtain the bacterial supernatant, the full
grown individual or mixed bacterial cultures (Nostoc
with BUZ 2 after two days cultivation) were centrifuged
(4500 × g for 20 min) to produce cell pellets. To eliminate any cells remaining in the supernatant, the latter
were passed through a 0.2 μm filter (Whatman, Dassel,
Germany). The supernatant was checked microscopically
and by plating on SM agar or BG11 agar (Nostoc) for
the presence of bacterial cells.
To investigate the potential of cell to cell contact as a
possible mode of action between heterotrophs and cyanobacterium, 20 μL subsamples from microtiter plate
wells were microscopically checked (20× and 40×
objectives).
For the test treatment with washed heterotrophs, the
BUZ 2 and BUZ 3 cultures were centrifuged (as above)
and the pellet rinsed twice with fresh BG11 medium to
remove SM broth residuals. The final volume of BG11
medium was encompassed to reach wished density of
heterotrophs.
Measurement of cell density and CFU numbers

To measure the density of cyanobacteria, 20 μL subsamples were taken from three selected wells for each tested
treatment in microtiter plates (containing cyanobacterium) on days 3, 7, 11 and 21 of cultivation and placed
in a Neubauer-improved counting chamber. Two pictures per selected well were taken with a digital camera
(Color View, Soft Imaging System) connected to a
phase-contrast microscope (4× objective). The length of
the filaments was determined using “Soft Imaging System CellF” from Olympus (Germany). Cell numbers of
the autotroph were calculated from measured filament
lengths as mentioned previously.
To count the CFU numbers of the two heterotrophs,
100 μL subsamples from two selected wells in each column (treatments containing BUZ 2 or BUZ 3) were
decimally diluted and plated on SM agar on days 3, 7,
11 and 21 of cultivation. The CFU were counted after 3
or 5 days (for BUZ 3) of cultivation at 29°C in the dark.
Algicidal effect

The possible percent algicidal effect of heterotrophs on
cyanobacterium was calculated according Jung et al. [9]

Svercel et al. BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:357
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/357

as: (1 - T/C) × 100, where T is the cyanobacterial density in the presence of heterotroph (treatment group), C
is the cyanobacterial density in the control (two control
groups in absence of the heterotrophy: i) control in
BG11, ii) control in a mixture of SM and BG11).
Statistics

Cell numbers were log-transformed for statistical analyses. Analysis of variance was performed at the significance level of P < 0.05, using SPSS (version 17.0, SPSS
Inc. Chicago, IL) and means were separated using
Tukey’s test (P < 0.05). The whole experiment with
experimental set up was done twice and representative
data are shown.

Results
Effect of media on autotroph

In the absence of heterotrophic bacteria, the numbers of
cyanobacterial cells increased during the cultivation period. The mixture of SM/BG11 media (1:1) did not negatively influence the cyanobacterial growth during the
experiment (Figure 1a). There were slightly less cyanobacteria in mixture of SM/BG11 media than in only BG11.
However, this was observed only in the first measurement
(after 3 days) (Figure 1a). When Nostoc was cultivated in a
SM/BG11 mixed medium, there was a lower incidence of
long filaments than in BG11 only. However, the difference
between the mean lengths between these two treatments
was not statistically significant (data not shown).
Effect of heterotrophs on autotroph

The strain BUZ 2 showed a strong negative effect on the
autotroph when the cultivation medium was composed
of SM/BG11. No cyanobacterial filaments were observed
(only single remaining cells) after the second measurement (7 d) (Figure 1a and 2b). The calculated algicidal
effect reached 98% after the second measurement (7d)
and subsequently increased to nearly 100% (Figure 1b).
In the absence of SM medium, the washed BUZ 2 culture was not able to diminish the cyanobacterial population. Unexpectedly in this case, Nostoc continued
growing slowly (data not shown).
Strain BUZ 3 had a slight positive effect on the number
of cyanobacterial cells (Figure 1a). However, the average
length of Nostoc filaments was shorter when cultivated in
the presence of heterotrophic BUZ 3 in SM/BG11 cocktail. It is inconclusive whether this was caused by BUZ 3,
SM medium, or both. The washed cultures of BUZ 3 had
no significant effect on numbers of cyanobacterial cells
or filament length (data not shown).
Mode of action

Physical interactions and contacts between the tested
filamentous heterotrophs and autotroph were observed

Page 3 of 8

on the microscopic pictures, and the cyanobacterial cells
showed some level of damage and lysis (Figure 3). Such
cell to cell contacts were found in the washed cultures
of heterotrophs as well. The presence of heterotrophic
supernatants from axenic cultures did not affect Nostoc
numbers negatively. The results were similar as in control treatments. Therefore, we assumed that no lytic
compounds were produced in the pure heterotrophic
cultures prior the experiment. However, the supernatant
extracted from mixed, fully grown cultures of Nostoc
and BUZ 2 showed significant negative effects on the
number of cyanobacterial cells. After 3 days, the algicidal effect reached 62%, and after the second and third
measurements it had reached above 91%. In addition,
the length and numbers of multicellular cyanobacterial
filaments significantly decreased (data not shown). This
means that BUZ 2 is producing lytic compound only in
the presence of cyanobacterium.
Effect of media and autotroph on heterotrophs

Growth of Fibrella aestuarina (BUZ 2) was stimulated significantly in the presence of cyanobacterium when cultivated in the mixture of SM/BG11 media (there was
already an effect after the first measurement on the third
day; Figure 4a). However, the CFU numbers decreased
rapidly by the third and the fourth measurements (11 and
21 days). This is probably caused by depletion of nutrients
in the medium. BUZ 2 grew better in treatments that
included BG11 in comparison to cultures with only SM
(Figure 4a). However, when grown in only BG11 after
washing (Figure 4c), BUZ 2 did not grow significantly better than in SM. Interestingly, when cultivated in the presence of Nostoc, there was a significant decreased of CFU
numbers in comparison to treatment with BG11 by the
end of the experiment after 21 days (Figure 4c). When
cyanobacterial extract was added to washed BUZ 2, higher
CFUs were detected in comparison to treatments with
BG11 and BG11/cyanobacterium in three of four measurements (Figure 4c). This means that BUZ 2 was able to
grow on cyanobacterial metabolites.
Similar to BUZ 2, Fibrisoma limi (BUZ 3) was influenced positively when grown in the following three mixtures: i) SM/Noctoc in BG11 (Figure 4b), ii) SM/BG11
and iii) SM/cyanobacterial extract in BG11. However, no
significant differences were found in the first measurement (after 3 days), which could be due to the generally
slower growth of BUZ 3 in comparison to BUZ 2 (Filippini, personal communication). Cyanobacterial extract
boosted the growth of washed BUZ 3 in the second and
third measurement. The CFU numbers of washed heterotroph in BG11 did not change significantly within
the cultivation period. However, CFUs were significantly
lower in the last measurement (21 d) when washed BUZ
3 was cultivated with Nostoc (Figure 4d).

Discussion
Effect of media and heterotrophs on autotroph

Many phylogenetically diverse heterotrophic bacteria
have been isolated and identified from environments
dominated by cyanobacteria (e.g, cyanobacterial blooms)
[1]. In mixed cultures, the interaction between cyanobacteria and other bacteria can vary from mutualistic
(mostly connected with nutrient exchanges and cycling)
[10] to growth-inhibition or cell-lysis of one of the
actors.
Cultivation conditions are a very important issue
affecting the outcome of these interactions. From our
preliminary experiment, SM/BG11 broth showed the
least adverse influence on Nostoc growth from the

various broths tested (including media with carbon
sources, data not shown). However, when adding SM to
cyanobacteria, their growth was negatively affected
slightly for a few initial days due to the new condition.
But later, as shown by the second measurement (day 7),
the Nostoc cultures appeared to adapt to this cocktail
and were growing even better than in pure BG11 (Figure 1a). Indeed, according the literature, Nostoc muscorum can grow heterotrophically if glucose is present
[11]; as is the case in SM medium.
BUZ 2 had a strong significant negative effect on cyanobacterial growth under nutrient rich conditions (SM/
BG11). However it had no effect under nutrient poor
conditions (SM washed out with BG11). One

explanation could be that BUZ 2 first fed on SM and
used trace elements, iron and nitrate from BG11,
reached high cell numbers, and after finishing the carbon sources, started to attack the cyanobacterial filaments. Hence the interaction could start as nutrient and
space competition and later switch to predation. In
washed cultures (nutrient poor), Fibrella was not able to
reach a density of cells which would have allowed them
to destroy cyanobacterial filaments. Indeed, the ratio
between pathogen (or predator) and host (or prey) is an
important factor in natural pathogenicity (or predation)
and also species dependent [12]. The ratios of BUZ 2 to
Nostoc cells were very different in SM/BG11 in comparison to washed cultures in BG11 media. In SM/BG11,
the cell ratios progressed from 1:1 (starting point), to
241:1 (3 d), 314:1 (6 d), 17:1 (11 d) and 1:2 (21 d). Conversely, in nutrient poor BG11 medium, the ratios
favoured Nostoc with values 1:1, 1:7, 1:12 and 1:18218.
Therefore, by varying the ratio in favor of BUZ 2, it
could be still possible that the heterotroph may harm
the cyanobacterium under nutrient poor conditions, but
this remains to be tested.
Fibrisoma sp. strain BUZ 3 had no significant effect on
the autotroph. Microscopic pictures (Figure 3 c and f)

suggest physical contact between BUZ 3 and cyanobacterial cells, but cell numbers of BUZ 3 might have been
too low to significantly harm cyanobacterial growth.
Indeed, the ratios of BUZ 3 to Nostoc (maximal ratio
was 24:1 after seven days) did not reach as high as in
the BUZ 2 case. This might be due to their low growth
rate (in comparison to BUZ 2) or to their physiological
characteristics. In washed cultures in BG11, all of the
ratios were tilted towards higher numbers of cyanobacteria (lowest cell ratio 1:3120 in the last measurement).
Negative effects of heterotrophic bacteria on cyanobacterial growth could be caused via different modes of
action, including nutrient and space competition, production of secondary metabolites in the close vicinity of
entrapped cyanobacteria (so called indirect way) and/or
contact lysis and parasitism (direct way). The observed
physical interaction between the filaments of the heterotrophs and the autotroph possibly imply either contact
lysis or entrapment with production of extracellular
compounds. This is in agreement with present literature,
where the five members of the order Sphingobacteriales
showed similar mechanisms when tested on filamentous
or non-filamentous cyanobacteria [2-4]. Interestingly,
extracts of both our tested heterotrophs had no effect

on cyanobacteria. However, it should be noted that we
had filtered the extract from heterotrophs that had been
grown in the absence of cyanobacteria (in pure cultures). The possibility remained that production of
harmful substances may depend on the presence of the
prey (in our case cyanobacteria), or could be released
only on the cell surface of the prey. This possibility was
tested using the supernatant from mixed cultures of
BUZ 2 and Nostoc cultivated together for two days. This
supernatant displayed negative effects on cyanobacterial
growth after three days. In comparison, Sallal [3]
showed that Flexibacter flexilis adsorbed to Oscillatoria
williamsii and then released a lysozyme lysing the cyanobacterium. Furthermore, extracellular metabolites in
the cell filtrates (from pure bacterial cultures) led to
growth inhibition. Rashidan and Bird [2] analyzed the
mode of action of two Cytophaga strains on cyanobacteria. Given the fact that lysing enzymes were not
secreted into the medium (extracts gained from pure
and mixed cultures as well), and it appeared that no
special attachment organelles exist on the surface of
Cytophaga, it seems likely that surface lytic enzymes
were involved in the lytic action [2]. The lytic bacteria
also inhibited photosynthesis, glycolate dehydrogenase
and nitrogenase. The wide host range of tested Flexibacter (which includes Nostoc muscorum) indicates the

possibility of using those bacteria in controlling cyanobacterial growth [3].
A novel strain of filamentous helical Saprospira did
not produced cyanobactericidal compounds into medium but showed group behaviour when cultivated
together with filamentous Anabaena sp [4]. It formed
three-dimensional reticular structures and lysed the host
through direct contact. Furthermore, its group behavior
greatly accelerated the cyanobactericidal process in comparison to individual filaments. Therefore a relevant
question arises: do filamentous heterotrophs mainly act
as a bundle of filaments or as single filaments? Unfortunately, only Shi et al. [4] explicitly mentioned that the
Saprospira strain is filamentous and that it builds up
such group structures. Figure 3e is an example indicating that the tested heterotrophs could aggregate and
cover parts of cyanobacterial filaments. It is not known
how often this happens, and whether this kind of behavior is representative for the tested heterotrophs.
Further experiments could shed light on the occurrence
and mechanism of this mode of action. Concerning
other closely related taxa, Flexibacter flexilis, Cytophaga
sp. (according Reichenbach [13]) and Chytinophaga
sancti [14] should be filamentous. However, this could
not be seen it the pictures of strains tested by Sallal [3]
nor by Rashidan and Bird [2]. Therefore, additional

(Figure 4). However, in the presence of Nostoc, the outcome of competition can depend on ratios between heterotroph and autotroph. Both heterotrophs could
survive well when washed in BG11 (nutrient poor) during the whole experiment (Figure 4c, d). This was not
always true when Nostoc was present. It is possible that
Nostoc uses some strategy to out-compete the heterotrophs. An example are some strains of Nostoc muscorum that produce toxins which kill heterotrophs [16].
However, it is not known whether the strain we use
produces toxins.
Our results suggest that the outcome of interaction
between filamentous heterotroph and autotroph depends
on the presence of nutrient in cultivation media, which
boost or reduce the numbers of heterotrophs and hence
change the ratios between the actors. To understand

studies are necessary. The appropriate use of electron
microscopy and atomic force microscopy, as done by
Malfatti and Azam [15] could clarify this issue.
Effects of media and phototroph on heterotrophs

Our experimental set up allowed us to check the densities and survival of heterotrophs in different situations
[see Additional file 1]. This issue is often not reported
in lytic studies of cyanobacteria. We detected better
growth of both heterotrophs in the mixture of SM/
BG11 than in SM or BG11 alone (Figure 4). This could
be expected as BG11 contains nitrate, iron and trace elements such as B, Mo, Co, Cu and Mn which are very
important for heterotrophic metabolism. Furthermore,
our tested heterotrophs could use cyanobacterial cells
and cyanobacterial supernatant as nutrient sources

these interactions, additional research is needed. In particular, it is necessary to shed light unto the mode of
action for lysis by heterotrophs and the possible defence
