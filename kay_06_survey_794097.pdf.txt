Abstract
Background: A full understanding of the patterns and processes of biological diversification
requires the dating of evolutionary events, yet the fossil record is inadequate for most lineages
under study. Alternatively, a molecular clock approach, in which DNA or amino acid substitution
rates are calibrated with fossils or geological/climatic events, can provide indirect estimates of clade
ages and diversification rates. The utility of this approach depends on the rate constancy of
molecular evolution at a genetic locus across time and across lineages. Although the nuclear
ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (nrITS) is increasingly being used to infer clade ages
in plants, little is known about the sources or magnitude of variation in its substitution rate. Here,
we systematically review the literature to assess substitution rate variation in nrITS among
angiosperms, and we evaluate possible correlates of the variation.
Results: We summarize 28 independently calibrated nrITS substitution rates ranging from 0.38 ×
10-9 to 8.34 × 10-9 substitutions/site/yr. We find that herbaceous lineages have substitution rates
almost twice as high as woody plants, on average. We do not find any among-lineage phylogenetic
constraint to the rates, or any effect of the type of calibration used. Within life history categories,
both the magnitude of the rates and the variance among rates tend to decrease with calibration age.
Conclusion: Angiosperm nrITS substitution rates vary by approximately an order of magnitude,
and some of this variation can be attributed to life history categories. We make cautious
recommendations for the use of nrITS as an approximate plant molecular clock, including an outline
of more appropriate phylogenetic methodology and caveats against over interpretation of results.
We also suggest that for lineages with independent calibrations, much of the variation in nrITS
substitution rates may come from uncertainty in calibration date estimates, highlighting the
importance of accurate and/or multiple calibration dates.

Background
Decades after the idea of a molecular clock was first

broached[1], the weight of evidence suggests that rate heterogeneity, not rate constancy, is the norm in molecular

evolution (reviewed in [2,3]) and that an exact molecular
clock will not be found. Nevertheless, an approximate
clock can be established for a locus with many independent calibrations [4], and would be useful for roughly dating lineages and testing time-dependent evolutionary
hypotheses. Local rate-constancy and even a single calibration can allow dating within a particular lineage, but
much of the excitement surrounding molecular clocks
stems from the possibility of approximating dates for the
majority of lineages that lack independent calibrations.
This has become commonplace in the animal kingdom,
especially with the widely applied mtDNA clock [5,6], but
a general molecular clock able to date relatively recent
divergences in plants remains elusive. Because there will
be variation among independently calibrated substitution
rates, a first step in determining whether a particular locus
may be useful as a molecular clock is to ascertain the
amount and sources of this rate variation.

rates, examine potential correlates that may account for
some of the variation in rates, and make conservative recommendations regarding the use of nrITS as an approximate molecular clock for angiosperms.

In the last decade, the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (nrITS) has revolutionized specieslevel plant phylogenetics. Because concerted evolution
has generally homogenized sequence variation among the
numerous ribosomal DNA copies within an individual,
direct sequencing of this region is possible for most systems. This, coupled with the availability of universal
primers and elevated substitution rates compared to most
chloroplast regions, make it especially accessible and
appropriate for resolving interspecific phylogenetic relationships [7,8]. Although reliance on nrITS as the sole
source of phylogenetic evidence has come under criticism
because of certain features of its evolution [9], it remains
the most efficient locus for generating species-level phylogenetic inferences in most plant groups.

Phylogenetic signal
Twenty-one different angiosperm families are represented
among the 29 rates, which comprise non-overlapping
portions of the Angiosperm evolutionary tree. No significant phylogenetic signal to the rates was detected (p =
0.393), suggesting that phylogenetic relatedness is not an
appropriate justification when choosing rates from the literature. Indeed, rates from the family Asteraceae alone
span almost the entire range found in Table 1, from 2.5 ×
10-9 subs/site/year in Eupatorium to 7.83 × 10-9 subs/site/
year in Robinsonia.

The widespread use of the nrITS region at the species level
makes it a good candidate for a potential plant molecular
clock. Substitution rates have been independently calibrated for a number of plant groups with diverse life histories and growth forms that represent distinct branches
of the angiosperm phylogeny. Preliminary surveys of
some of these rates suggest that they vary by almost an
order of magnitude [10,11]. However, these limited surveys do not fully evaluate the variation in available nrITS
substitution rates nor do they examine possible sources of
this variation. Even without a full summary of nrITS rate
variation, there is a growing trend in the literature to utilize some published rates for groups that lack their own
independent calibration, either by choosing a rate based
on life history similarity or phylogenetic relatedness, or by
using a range of the more commonly-cited rates, such as
Suh (1993) or Sang (1994, 1995). Here, we conduct a systematic search of the literature in order to identify and
evaluate more thoroughly nrITS rate variation. Specifically, we report a summary of independently calibrated

Results
Literature survey
We identified 29 independent nrITS substitution rates
ranging from 0.38 × 10-9 subs/site/yr in Hamamelis to 19 ×
10-9 subs/site/yr in Gentiana Sect. Ciminalis (Fig. 1; Table
1). The latter rate was excluded as an outlier from all of
our analyses since the calibration was based on only a single base-pair substitution and the rate was greater than
double the second highest rate of 8.34 × 10-9 subs/site/
year in Soldanella. The mean of the 28 remaining rates was
2.86 × 10-9 subs/site/yr. Of those studies reporting results
of rate constancy tests, 12 out of 19 passed or partially
passed (Table 1).

Life history effects
The average nrITS substitution rates for herbaceous and
woody lineages are significantly different (p = 0.0013,
Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test; Fig. 1). The herbaceous annual/
perennial rates ranged from 1.72 × 10-9 to 8.34 × 10-9 substitutions/site/year (mean = 4.13 × 10-9 subs/site/yr, N =
10), and the woody perennial rates ranged from 0.38 × 109 to 7.83 × 10-9 substitutions/site/year (mean = 2.15 × 109 subs/site/yr, N = 18). In our analysis of phylogenetic
independent contrasts, we found that nine of ten life history contrasts exhibit a lower rate associated with the
woody perennial lineage (Sign Test, p < 0.01). The single
opposing contrast involved the Hawaiian silverswords.
This rate is based on a clade that includes both the woody
perennial silverswords and the herbaceous perennial tarweeds. Although initially coded as woody perennials, this
state is considered the derived condition among the tarweeds. Therefore, the rate may be more representative of
the herbaceous perennial ancestry in the clade than the
derived woody perennial silversword lineage. Our contrast results are robust to either life history classification of
the tarweed/silversword rate (alternative coding, p <
0.01).

Discussion
Range of nrITS substitution rates
This study represents the most comprehensive collection
of nrITS substitution rates to date. The largest previous
survey [10] included independently calibrated rates from
12 angiosperm lineages. They recommended using a
range of rates from 1.72 × 10-9 to 7.83 × 10-9 for dating the
diversification of Inga, after removing the rate from Winteraceae because of its longer generation time and possible error associated with the calibration date. The
addition of 16 independently calibrated rates in our study
introduces seven new rates slower than 1.72 × 10-9, one of
which is slower than the Winteraceae rate. Our broader
sampling of nrITS substitution rates allowed us to analyze
more fully potential sources of variation in these rates.

Life history effects
Striking differences in rates of nrITS evolution between
life history categories, with annuals/herbaceous perennials exhibiting significantly higher rates, are consistent
with a general pattern of higher substitution rates for
annual compared to perennial plants and for herbs compared to woody trees that has been reported from chloroplast [12-16] and mitochondrial studies [17]. Life history
has also been suggested to affect rates specifically of nrITS
substitution ([18,19] but see [20]), with annual species
exhibiting longer nrITS branch lengths than perennials. In
a more comprehensive review, however, Whittle and
Johnston [21] found no difference in nrITS branch lengths
between sister taxa differing in annual versus perennial
life history. Our study may be more likely to detect rate
differences associated with life history because we are
using more distinctly polarized life history categories and

our comparisons are across deeper phylogenetic splits,
with more time for rate differences to accumulate.
Although the underlying mechanism is unclear, our
results agree with previous studies in which shorter generation times are associated with faster rates of molecular
evolution [22,23]. It is difficult to explain how generation
time would affect substitution rates in plants, which do
not sequester their germ lines and therefore can pass on
somatic mutations to their gametes, unless the majority of
inherited mutations arise during meiosis and not mitosis.
Furthermore, we do not know whether generation time
per se is a causative factor of substitution rate variation.
Differences in generation time in plants are confounded
by correlated differences in growth form [21] and mating
system [24], such that perennials are the only plants forming extensive wood and annuals are much more frequently self-fertilizing. A mechanistic understanding of

the effects of these factors on rates of molecular evolution
will increase the power of molecular clock approaches in
plant evolution.
Errors in rate estimation
A potentially confounding factor associated with our life
history classes is the type of calibration point used and its
potential associated rate biases. Fossil data typically provide a minimum age of a particular lineage, and therefore
may be more likely to overestimate a substitution rate,
while biogeographic or climatic events provide a maximum age and may be more likely to underestimate a rate.
Thus, an unacknowledged correlation between life history
and calibration type potentially could confound our
results for rate differences between woody and herbaceous
plants. These potential biases appear not to be an issue.
First, our dataset is well balanced with fossil calibrated
rates for eight woody perennial and for six herbaceous

Calibration Age (Ma)
Figure 2
The effects of calibration age
The effects of calibration age. A comparison of nrITS substitution rates with calibration age reveals higher variance at
younger calibration points. The decreasing substitution rate with older calibration ages is only significant for the woody perennials. The herbaceous annual/perennial regression is not significant and becomes even less so when the outlier is removed (p =
0.861).
annual/perennial groups. There is no overall correlation
between type of calibration and life history category (χ2 =
0.156, ns). Second, within each life history category, we
see no apparent bias due to the type of calibration. For
example, within the herbaceous rates, only one of the five
highest rates is calibrated exclusively with fossil evidence.
Similarly, of the five slowest woody perennial rates, three
are biogeographic and two are fossil calibrated.
The age of the calibration point may affect the precision of
the substitution rate estimates, since more recent calibration ages are based on fewer "ticks" of the molecular
clock. Older lineages will have more nucleotide substitutions and thus these rate estimates should become more
precise, at least until they become biased by sequence saturation, or multiple substitutions at the same site. Among
our 29 original rates, calibration ages ranged from 0.1 Ma
to 83 Ma. There appears to be substantially more variation
in substitution rates based on recent calibration points
compared to those from older calibration ages in both life

history categories (Fig. 2). An extreme example is the
exceptionally high rate from Gentiana sect. Ciminalis, that
was more than twice as high as any other rate. This rate
was calibrated based on a biogeographic split of only 0.1
Ma after which only one nucleotide substitution occurred
[25]. When rate is regressed on age of calibration, separately for each life history category, the residuals exhibit a
negative trend with increasing calibration age indicating
lower variance for older calibration ages (Fig. 2). Another
indication of this trend is found by comparing the variation in residuals for rates with calibration points older and
younger than 30 Ma. The mean absolute value of these
residuals in the more recently calibrated half is more than
three times higher than in the half with older calibrations.
We also found a trend of decreasing rate with the age of
calibration, which was significant among woody perennials (Fig. 2). This trend may be due to the models of
sequence evolution utilized for estimating sequence divergence. Without correcting for sequence saturation, rate

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:36

estimates are expected to decrease with increasing time
since divergence [5,6]. In molecular clock calculations,
using a model of sequence evolution that does not fully
capture sequence saturation and among-site rate variation
potentially can lead to large errors in divergence time estimates (reviewed in [3]). Most of the original rates we
found used the relatively simple Jukes-Cantor or Kimura
2-parameter models, so this might be a significant issue,
particularly for studies with older calibration dates. Ideally, objective criteria for model selection, such as the likelihood ratio tests easily implemented in MODELTEST
[26] should be used before calculating a rate.
As a post hoc exploration of the effects of methods of estimating sequence divergence, including the choice of substitution model and the treatment of rate heterogeneity
among branches, we reanalyzed the sequence data used to
estimate two of the nrITS rates, for the Winteraceae [27]
with one of the oldest calibration dates and for Dendroseris
[28] with a recent calibration. These are also two of the
most frequently cited rates in the literature. For the Winteraceae, our resulting substitution rate estimates, based
on a TrN+G substitution model and penalized likelihood
rate smoothing, are higher than crude estimates based on
uncorrected counts of pairwise differences. However, the
uncertainty reported for their biogeographic calibration –
the isolation of Pseudowinteraceae in Australia – for
which estimates range from 50 to 80 Ma, affected the overall rate estimates substantially more than the different
methods of estimating branch lengths (substitutions/site/
year × 10-9: 50 Ma calibration crude = 0.52, corrected =
0.65; 80 Ma calibration crude = 0.33, corrected = 0.41).
Importantly, for this group with one of the oldest calibrations, which should be more sensitive to the effects of
sequence saturation and rate heterogeneity, branch length
estimation methods make a small difference in light of the
overall range of nrITS substitution rates in our survey, not
even affecting its category in the histogram of Figure 1. For
Dendroseris, there was no significant rate heterogeneity,
and using a more complex substitution model had no
effect on the substitution rate estimate. In contrast, there
was substantial variation in rates due to uncertainty in the
biogeographic calibration, ranging from 4 Ma based on
the age of Masatierra Island to 2.6 Ma based on a chloroplast DNA clock calculation (substitutions/site/year × 109: 4 Ma calibration = 3.94; 2.6 Ma calibration = 6.06).
These reanalyses suggest that fine-tuning the estimates of
molecular substitution makes a relatively small change to
the overall rate estimate in light of substantial uncertainty
in calibration dates. While branch length estimates clearly
should be optimized, there is also a real need for more
accurate and multiple calibrations to reduce the uncertainty of rate estimates [29].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/36

An approximate plant molecular clock?
The variance we find in nrITS substitution rates is likely
the result of both error in individual rate estimates and
biological differences among lineages in actual substitution rates. As noted above, substantial error in estimating
individual rates can come from uncertainty in the dating
of the fossil or biogeographic/climatic event used as a calibration and in the assignment of that calibration to a
node in the phylogeny [29,30]. Further error is contributed by uncertainty in the phylogeny itself, both in the
branching topology and the branch length estimates [31].
Another issue is that gene trees are not identical to species
trees [3]. Coalescence of nrITS alleles should predate species divergences by a factor related to the effective population size, and any reticulate evolution or lineage sorting
could obscure the true tree topology [32]. In attempting to
date a particular plant lineage, few studies adequately consider these sources of error.

While some of the variance in the rates we found likely
comes from these sources of error, there are also very real
differences in nrITS substitution rates within and among
lineages. Statistically significant rate heterogeneity was
found in seven of the nineteen studies reporting tests of
rate constancy. Furthermore, in spite of all the sources of
noise in our dataset, we found a substantial effect of life
history, with long-lived woody plants exhibiting much
slower substitution rates than shorter-lived herbaceous
lineages. Thus even if error in substitution rate estimates
could be eliminated, the existence of a universal nrITS
substitution rate is highly unlikely.
Despite the many sources of error in rate estimates, however, we find a limited distribution of rates with a central
tendency, especially when separated by life history category (Fig. 1). We therefore support the cautious use of this
locus as a general molecular clock for roughly dating
events in plant evolution, but we offer a few important
caveats. Borrowing just one or a few rates from the literature, especially based on phylogenetic relatedness, does
not adequately account for the nature and extent of variation in the nrITS "clock". Instead, to roughly estimate a
date we suggest that, within a life history category, the
entire range of rates be considered. Furthermore, before
using any rate for dating historical events, whether calculated from an internal calibration or borrowed from the
literature, nrITS rate constancy should be tested within the
group of interest, ideally with a tree-based likelihood ratio
test [33,34], and any lack of local rate constancy should be
considered in the dating methodology [35].
The distribution of rates could then be used to examine
specific hypotheses for the timing of events for lineages
without calibrations of their own. For example, if there is
a hypothesis for the age of a particular node in the phyl-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:36

ogeny of a group of taxa with an nrITS dataset, one could
calculate the required substitution rate to fit that age to the
node and then compare the required rate to the distribution of rates presented here. A good example of this type
of hypothesis testing is found in the genus Aquilegia
(Ranunculaceae). Hummingbird pollination in this group
was suggested to have originated during the mid-Pliocene
(ca. 3.5 Ma) based on floristic associations [36]. Hodges
et al. [37] calculated the nrITS substitution rate necessary
within Aquilegia to fit the hypothesized age of the hummingbird pollination syndrome (0.11% per my = 0.56 ×
10-9 subs/site/yr). This is approximately ten times slower
than the average annual/perennial herbaceous rate (4.13
× 10-9) and more than three times slower than the slowest
annual/perennial herbaceous value. Even using the slowest annual/perennial rate (1.72 × 10-9), the estimated age
of hummingbird pollination is only half as old as predicted (approximately 1.66 Ma). Without any justification
for such an unusually slow nrITS substitution rate in Aquilegia, hummingbird pollination likely has evolved more
recently than originally predicted [37].

Conclusion
The results from our literature survey underscore the popularity of the nrITS region as a tool to date relatively recent
historical events in plant evolution. The original rates that
we found came from a broad taxonomic spectrum representing a diversity of life histories and were calculated
using a variety of calibrations and methodologies. Nevertheless, the rates were consistent to approximately an
order of magnitude, or even less for herbaceous lineages
considered separately. Although this survey should be
considered an ongoing project, given these initial results,
the nrITS may be useful as an approximate molecular
clock for roughly dating divergences, calculating diversification rates, and hypothesis testing in plant groups that
currently lack a fossil or biogeographic calibration of their
own.

Methods
Literature survey
We surveyed Systematic Botany, Molecular Phylogenetics and
Evolution, The American Journal of Botany, Evolution and any
references therein, from January 1995 through December
2003. We recorded rates for any study that independently
calibrated and reported a rate for ITS1 and ITS2. If multiple rates were reported, we followed the author's recommendation on which was likely to be most accurate,
unless their reasoning was based on the rate's similarity to
other published rates. In such cases, we took the average
of the reported rates. When separate rates were reported
for ITS1 and ITS2, a weighted average based on the average length of each nrITS region was calculated. For each
rate, we also recorded the predominant growth form/life

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/36

history [38,39], rate constancy test results, calibration
type, and calibration age.
Phylogenetic signal
Frequently, authors that utilize published rates in their
own studies base their choices on phylogenetic relatedness. In order to determine whether such choices are warranted, we tested for any phylogenetic signal in the rates.
First we constructed a phylogeny of the taxa represented in
our rates survey using the web-based program Phylomatic
[40] and then manually edited the tree to reflect recent
and more detailed phylogenetic hypotheses for some families [41-43] (tree available upon request). The Test for
Serial Independence was implemented in the program
Phylogenetic Independence v. 2.0 [44,45] with 1000 randomizations. This test compares the autocorrelation of
adjacent branches of the original tree to that of a series of
randomized trees.
Life history effects
Generation time has been suggested to affect rates of
molecular evolution [22,23], and thus we classified each
rate according to the predominant life history of the clade,
either annual/herbaceous perennial or woody perennial,
as a proxy for generation time. The herbaceous category
consists of relatively short-lived plants that reach sexual
maturity within one to a few years, while the woody perennial life history category consists of long-lived lineages.
It is possible that phylogenetic relatedness and life history
could be confounded. Thus, to be conservative we also
tested for rate differences due to life history using phylogenetically independent contrasts. Contrasts were identified with the BRUNCH algorithm in CAIC [46], using the
same cladogram as in the above mentioned Test for Serial
Independence. BRUNCH locates nodes for which there is
a contrast in life history, and then calculates the direction
of the rate difference across that node, using each taxon in
no more than one contrast. It assumes that if sister taxa
have the same life history state their most recent common
ancestor also had that state, and that, when branch
lengths are unknown, the rate for this ancestor can be calculated as the average rate of the derived taxa.
Reanalysis of Winteraceae and Dendroseris examples
We reanalyzed the sequence data used to estimate the
nrITS rates for the Winteraceae (GenBank accessions
AY004111-AY004128; [27] Additional File 1) and for
Dendroseris [28] Additional File 2. We aligned the
sequences with ClustalX and refined the alignments manually. Phylogenetic relationships were estimated in PAUP
4.0b10 [47] using maximum likelihood and a TrN+G substitution model for Winteraceae and a TrNef model for
Dendroseris, as chosen by MODELTEST. For Winteraceae,
we found significant substitution rate heterogeneity in
nrITS using a tree-wide likelihood ratio test for differences

between clock-constrained and clock-unconstrained trees
(p < 0.01; [34]). We then used penalized likelihood rate
smoothing implemented in R8S [35] to estimate branch
lengths and substitution rates in the face of this heterogeneity. Within Dendroseris, we did not find significant rate
heterogeneity with a tree-wide LRT (p > 0.1), and therefore rate smoothing was unnecessary for estimating substitution rates.
