Abstract
In recent years it was reported that the accumulation of point mutations in VP4 and VP7 genes of
rotavirus strains was the main cause of the failure of the G or P-typing. Failures in the correct
genotyping of G1, G2, G8, G9 and G10 rotavirus strains were reported in the most commonly used
reverse transcription (RT)-PCR strategies. Collecting VP7 gene sequences of G1 rotavirus strains
from databases we found that 74 (61.2 %) out of 121 G1 strains from lineage I showed the four
specific mismatches at the 5' end of the 9T1-1 primer, previously associated with the failure of G1typing. Thus, a great percentage of the G1 strains from lineage I worldwide reported could not have
been typed if the Das's RT-PCR strategy were used. This analysis shows that the failure on the
detection of the G1 strains could be due to the diversification of rotavirus strains in phylogenetic
lineages. Therefore, the use of different RT-PCR strategies with different primer binding locations
on the VP7 gene or new typing methodologies -like microarrays procedures- could be a better
option to avoid the failure of the G-typing of rotavirus strains detected during surveillance
programs.

Findings
Causing more than 450,000 deaths per year, group A rotaviruses are the most important cause of acute diarrhea in
children throughout the world [1].
Based on the antigenicity and amino acid differences from
the two outermost proteins, VP4 and VP7 respectively,
group A rotaviruses are classified into P and G-types [2].
At the time, at least 26 P and 15 G-types were detected [24], most of them showing a high degree of intragenic
diversification due to point mutations, insertions and/or
deletions [5-12]. Although the most frequent human Gtypes of a given geographical region change from season

to season, the genotype G1 is considered the most prevalent worldwide [13].
Since the vaccination against rotavirus may induce selective effects on the diversity of strains, vaccine-escape
mutants could emerge. In order to evaluate the vaccine
efficiency, the surveillance programs should detect the
diversity of rotavirus strains before, during and after the
introduction of a rotavirus vaccine [14].
Since the introduction of reverse transcription (RT)-PCR
for rotavirus genotyping, many epidemiological surveillances have been conducted and new data has been colPage 1 of 4

recently it was suggested the use of modified or degenerated primers to avoid the mismatches between the primer
and the VP7 gene [17,20].

Lineage I

In a recent paper published by Rahman et al [19], it was
reported the failure of the Das's RT-PCR strategy to detect
most (75%) of the G1 human rotavirus isolated in Bangladesh during the surveillance in 2002. They argue that
this failure was due to four mismatches found at the 5'
end of the primer binding site. Although two G1 strains
correctly typed had a 100% identity with the untypeable
strains, they concluded that the remainder 25% could be
typed because the 3' end of the primer binding site had a
perfect match.

lected to understand this complex epidemiology [15].
However, in recent years it was reported that the accumulation of point mutations in VP4 and VP7 genes was the
main cause of the failure of the G or P-typing of rotavirus
strains
[7,8,12,16-21].
At least, there are four multiplex RT-PCR strategies commonly used for rotavirus G-typing [17,22-24] and one for
P-typing [25]. In the one developed by Gouvea et al [24],
it was reported failures in the correct genotyping of G2,
G8, G9 and G10 rotavirus strains [7,12,17,20,21], and

In order to evaluate how many G1 strains included in the
GenBank database have these four specific mismatches
and its clustering within specific lineages, we collected
173 sequences of the VP7 gene from G1 strains from the
GenBank database Release 151, December 2005 (alignments are available from the authors on request). A phylogenetic tree was constructed from aligned coding
sequences, using Neighbor-joining or parsimony methods with Kimura 2-parameter as a model of nucleotide
substitution with the MEGA 3.1 [26] and Phylip v3.65
softwares. The statistical significance of the tree was preformed by bootstrapping, using 1000 pseudo-replicates
data sets.
All the strains grouped within one of the four lineages previously reported by Jin et al [5] (Fig. 1). The typeable and
untypeable G1 strains reported by Rahman et al [19],
grouped within the lineage I with a high bootstrap value
(95 %) (data not shown). Seventy four (61.2 %) out of
121 G1 strains from lineage I showed the four specific
mismatches at the 5' end of the 9T1-1 primer. This was
associated with the failure of genotyping of G1 strains
from Bangladesh. Two of them showed more than four
nucleotide mismatches. Forty two (34.7 %) showed only
3 out of the four nucleotide mismatches and the remainder 4.1% showed 3 out of the four nucleotide mismatches
plus others mismatches at the 9T1-1 primer binding site.
The strains grouped within lineage II, III and IV, showed
no more than two nucleotide mismatches, except for one
sample from lineage III (Brz-2; GenBank number:
U26362) that showed three out of the four nucleotide
mismatches (Fig. 1).
Interestingly, when we compared the 173 sequences of G1
strains with the aBT1 primer binding site, we found that
170 strains showed one or two nucleotide mismatches
and 3 showed three mismatches, suggesting that Gouvea's
RT-PCR strategy could type these strains correctly (data
not shown).

Thus, taking into account that 75% of the G1 strains with
four nucleotide mismatches were not detected during the
surveillance in Bangladesh [19], probably a high percentage out of the 121 strains from lineage I, included in our
analysis, could not be typed by the Das's RT-PCR strategy.
It is noteworthy that G1 strains from lineage I were the
most reported worldwide.
It was suggested to use modified or degenerated primers,
or change the priming binding site, in order to avoid the
mismatches between the primer and the VP7 gene
[7,17,20]. However, the failure of the G-typing of rotavirus strains, detected during surveillance programs, could
be avoided through different RT-PCR strategies that use
different primer binding locations on the VP7 gene
[7,19,27] or by new typing methodologies, like microarrays procedures [28,29].

This analysis shows that the failure on the detection of the
G1 strains could be due to the diversification of rotavirus
strains in phylogenetic lineages, as it was showed by Santos et al [7] in G9 strains when they used the Gouvea's RTPCR strategy.
