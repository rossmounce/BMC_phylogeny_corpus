Abstract
Background: The family Vitaceae consists of many different grape species that grow in a range of
climatic conditions. In the past few years, several studies have generated functional genomic
information on different Vitis species and cultivars, including the European grape vine, Vitis vinifera.
Our goal is to develop a comprehensive web data source for Vitaceae.
Description: VitisExpDB is an online MySQL-PHP driven relational database that houses
annotated EST and gene expression data for V. vinifera and non-vinifera grape species and varieties.
Currently, the database stores ~320,000 EST sequences derived from 8 species/hybrids, their
annotation (BLAST top match) details and Gene Ontology based structured vocabulary. Putative
homologs for each EST in other species and varieties along with information on their percent
nucleotide identities, phylogenetic relationship and common primers can be retrieved. The
database also includes information on probe sequence and annotation features of the high density
60-mer gene expression chip consisting of ~20,000 non-redundant set of ESTs. Finally, the database
includes 14 processed global microarray expression profile sets. Data from 12 of these expression
profile sets have been mapped onto metabolic pathways. A user-friendly web interface with
multiple search indices and extensively hyperlinked result features that permit efficient data
retrieval has been developed. Several online bioinformatics tools that interact with the database
along with other sequence analysis tools have been added. In addition, users can submit their ESTs
to the database.
Conclusion: The developed database provides genomic resource to grape community for
functional analysis of genes in the collection and for the grape genome annotation and gene function
identification. The VitisExpDB database is available through our website http://
cropdisease.ars.usda.gov/vitis_at/main-page.htm.

Background
Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are an abundant genomic
resource with 44,203,116 ESTs deposited as of July 2007

in the GenBank repository. ESTs are an important
genomic resource for all species, and more so in systems
for which no genome sequences are available. In such

cases, ESTs are used as the basis for structural genomic
annotation. ESTs are also fundamentally important for
studying global expression patterns [1]. Utilization of
effective bioinformatics tools has broadened the applications of EST analysis into the fields of genomics, marker
development and genome annotation among others [24].
The V. vinifera-based European grapevine is the most economically important fruit species worldwide, with over
7.4 million hectares under cultivation. Grapes are produced for fruit, juice, raisins, wine and spirits. Currently, a
draft genome is available, with comprehensive genome
annotation still in progress [5]. Recently, several Vitis species genomic projects have contributed to the growing
number of ESTs that are publicly available. There are
numerous North American native grape species and cultivars bred from these species that have economic value and
also are rich in germplasm resistant to different biotic and
abiotic stresses (See Additional File 1).

era (Grape) Genome Array ver. 1.0 (Affymetrix® Inc., Santa
Clara, CA), fabricated mainly for V. vinifera microarray
studies. Recently, there have been six reports of mRNA
expression profiling studies using either cDNA or oligo
arrays for measuring gene expression profiles for flowers
and berry skin development [10-12], and from water-deficit and iso-osmotic salinity stress in grapevine shoot tissues [13], as well as expression profiles associated with
viral diseases [14] and tissue specific profiles on berry tissues [15]. GrapePLEX is a MIAME-compliant and Plant
Ontology-enhanced expression database for Vitis microarray studies that is part of the Plant Expression Database
[PLEXdb] [16]. Currently, the expression datasets derived
from the GeneChip® Vitis vinifera (Grape) Genome Array
ver. 1.0 (Affymetrix® Inc., Santa Clara, CA) can be deposited here.

Today, there are over 320,000 Vitis ESTs deposited in the
NCBI GenBank. About 90% of these belong to V. vinifera,
followed by 3.0% from V. shuttleworthii. The remainder
includes ESTs from V. arizonica, V. aestivalis and V. riparia
among others (Table 1). Of these 320,000 Vitis ESTs,
about 200,000 ESTs derived from V. vinifera, V. aestivalis
and V. rupestris × V. arizonica have been characterized [68]. These ESTs were derived from cDNA libraries cloned
from different tissues and developmental stages during
biotic and abiotic stress [6-8]. Similarly, another 5,000
ESTs cloned from Suppression Subtractive Hybridization
(SSH) libraries of V. rupestris × V. arizonica hybrids in
response to Xylella fastidiosa infection have been recently
analyzed [9]. To our knowledge, there are no PUBMED
references on the characterization of the full-set of available Vitis ESTs.

Other online specialized databases contain information
on Vitis ESTs, such as the DFCI grape gene index database
that store information from V. vinifera ESTs (191,616 in
total) including information on the tentative consensus
sequences, their BLAST and Gene Ontology details [17].
Also, functional tools are available that allow comparison
of EST expression profiles from different libraries, and
information on alternate spiced forms, among others.
Similarly, EST sequence information along with their
microarray probe information can be obtained from the
Plant genome database PlantGDB, where about 210,000
V. vinifera ESTs are stored [18]. Information on the V. vinifera ESTs in different metabolic pathways can be obtained
from the KEGG website [19]. A more up-to-date data on
the clustered EST sequences from different Vitis species
with large EST collections can be obtained from the TIGR
plant transcript assemblies database [20]. The V. aestivalis
var. Norton EST database is available at Missouri State
Univ.-Mountain Grove and also includes a defense gene
database called GREED [21].

In 2004, as part of its GeneChip® Consortia Program,
Affymetrix introduced the 16K array GeneChip® Vitis vinif-

VitisExpDB was developed to curate and permit easy
access to all the available grape EST sources and integrate

Table 1: Sources of Vitis and the ESTs sequences in the database. There are a total of 329,964 ESTs currently in the database.

with the microarray data, especially data from custom
arrays from non-vinifera varieties and species, which are a
known source of biotic and abiotic stress resistance germplasm. Putative homologs have been identified across different Vitis cultivars and species and with the model plant
Arabidopsis. Several search and retrieval forms along with
online bioinformatics tools were developed to create a
comprehensive data warehouse for Vitis genomics
research. The database will be updated every six months
with available new data sets.

Construction and Content
Database architecture
The server uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 RPM (x86).
The relational database was developed using MySQL 4.0

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/23

as the back end. The website is powered by an Apache
server. HTML- and PHP-based web interfaces have been
developed which dynamically execute the MYSQL queries
and also run different dependent softwares (Figure 1).
Software packages, ADO database and BioPHP, have been
used to interact with the MYSQL database.
Data curation
ESTs
EST sets were down loaded from NCBI data banks (UniGene for V. vinifera, dbEST for the rest of the Vitis species,
Table 1) and searched using the BLASTX algorithm against
the entire 'nr' protein database using the NCBI BLAST
service. These results were reconfirmed by repeating the
similarity search using the Personal BLAST Navigator

(PLAN) software server [22]. In both the cases, an identity
cut-off E value of 10-4 was used. The Gene Ontology terms
[23] were generated using the High Throughput Gene
Ontology Functional Annotation (Ht-Go-Fat) toolkit
[24]. Sequence similarity search was carried out using the
default BLAST search parameters and a cut off E value of
10-4. The generated GO terms were hyperlinked to their
definitions and ontologies in the latest release of the
"Gene Ontology, OBO v1.2", downloaded from the GO
website [25]. The database also lists similar gene
sequences among different species of Vitis that were identified using our recently developed nWayComp tool [26].
For this, ESTs from V. vinifera, V. shuttleworthii, V. arizonica, V. aestivalis, V. riparia were subjected to reciprocal
BLAST searches using the BLASTN program with an expectation score cutoff of E-010. Potential applications of
identifying such putative homologs across different Vitis
species include deducing presumptive function of the
cloned ESTs, and cloning of ESTs from other varieties
based on primers designed from conserved regions. Similarly, such putative homologs can be used to develop SSR
and SNP markers for varietal identification and construction of genetic maps for marker assisted breeding. For the
V. vinifera dataset, the latest expression profiles downloaded from the UniGene built #21 have been wrapped
up with the PHP scripts to dynamically generate digital
EST expression profiles across nine different tissue types.
Microarray datasets
We have designed a V. vinifera and non-vinifera ESTenriched custom high density microarray gene chip with a
total of 20,020 ESTs (1,947 from the SSH libraries, 40
from the cDNA-AFLP experiments, 10,014 from V. vinifera, 5,470 from V. shuttleworthii, 1,219 from V. aestivalis,
780 from V. rupestris × V. arizonica and 588 from V.
riparia). The database includes analyzed global microarray
expression profiles generated in hosts infected with the
plant pathogenic bacterium X. fastidiosa, which causes
Pierce's disease in grapevines. The data were generated
from 36 hybridization experiments from three time
points: early (1 week), mid (6 weeks) and late (10 weeks)
stages of disease development from both infected and
non-infected tissues of stem and leaf from resistant and
susceptible genotypes. In addition, DNA sequence information on each of the EST sequences on the custom
microarrays along with the spotted probe and annotation
details is accessible. Further, the generated expression profiles have been mapped onto 25 metabolic pathways
using the TAIR's Pathway Tools Omics Viewer [27]. For
this, the normalized and fold change calculated expression values for the Vitis and X. fastidiosa interactions experiments were mapped on to these pathways. Putative
homologs Arabidopsis gene IDs of the Vitis ESTs on the
microarray chip were used for this purpose. Details of the
microarray experiments can be viewed at the website [27].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/23

Two other published custom microarray datasets [11,12]
have also been added to the database. Data will be
updated every six months.

Utility and Discussion
Web interface
On the main search page, there are two side panels with
the panel on the left listing hyperlinks to the different
search pages and online tools. The three main components, ESTs, microarrays and the bioinformatics tools, are
listed here. The panel on the right lists hyperlinks to the
Web Pages that describe the contents of the database.
Information, such as experimental set up, data analysis
and other relevant text, is provided in these pages. A
number of useful query interfaces for data mining, analysis and visualization have been developed. This includes
simple and advance search forms that facilitate either single query or multiple query search options for both EST
and microarrays components.

The EST component of the database can be searched using
GB number, GI number, Gene Ontology ID, enzyme
number or putative function as a key word. Other additional parameters, such as selecting a particular species/
variety from the dropdown list, setting a cut-off E value
and a cut-off BLAST score, can be included to build a stringent query. A typical results page displays ESTs matching
the query, individual EST sequence, its description, EC
number, and its Gene Ontology classification, (see Figure
2 A-B and see Additional file 3). Extensive hyperlinks have
been included in the result pages that will link the result
terms to other tabular data in the database and to external
databases such as NCBI and AmiGO database (see Figures
2 C and D in Additional file 2). Result pages include both
tables and graphs that are dynamically generated by PHP
scripts. For V. vinifera ESTs that represent a major portion
of the ESTs stored, users can also retrieve the digital
expression profile as well as percentage expression indices
across 9 different tissues types.
A separate Web Page is provided for listing the putative
homologs gene sets in the major Vitis varieties using
nWayComp. This information can be obtained from the
'Get Homologs" link on the left hand side of the main
database page. The main result page has a table with two
columns with the first column displaying the comparison
type and the second column displaying the number of
putative homologs gene sets for that combination (Figure
3A, and see Additional file 4). Numbers in the second column are hyperlinked to open HTML analysis files that
show a table that has all the sets of putative homologs
genes for that combination, Figure 3B (see Additional file
3). The first column of this page displays a sorted list of
putative homologs gene sets one per Vitis species or variety in the ascending order of their sequence similarity. The

second column of this table has the standard deviation of
sequence identities among putative homologs genes. For
each set of putative homologs genes, columns three to six
will have icons that are a hyperlinked to the files that will
display an identity table showing the percentage of
sequence identity among putative homologs genes, column 3; Figure 3C (see Additional file 3), a phylogenetic
tree, column 4; Figure 3D (see Additional file 3), common
primers used for PCR cloning that are sorted in the
descending order of the amplicon size, column 5; Figure
3E (see Additional file 3), and the gene sequences in
FASTA forma, column 6; Figure 3F (see Additional file 3).
To query the microarray data, a simple form can be used
whereby the user can enter a GB number, an array ID(s) or
a putative function (Figure 4A-B, and Additional file 2).
Alternately, an advanced search form is designed whereby
the user can build stringent Boolean searches, such as a
cut-off expression value or select a particular stage of the
experiment, tissue or genotype, or based on Arabidopsis
genes, for data retrieval. A typical microarray search result
will include sequence, annotation and probe details along
with a dynamically generated postscript image of the
sequence and annotation details along with expression
results in the form of a graph, Figure 4C (see Additional
file 4). On the advanced search page, an additional form
is provided that can be used to retrieve information on
microarray probes, Figure 4D (see Additional file 4).
Under the microarray warehouse, a separate HTML page
has been designed that has hyperlinked icons to various
metabolic pathways. There are 25 different pathways for
each of the 12 microarray experiments studied, created as
HTML pages from images generated by mapping the differentially regulated Vitis ESTs as described under the sub
section Microarray datasets. A separate Web Page lists dif-

ferent pathways where the Arabidopsis gene IDs has been
linked to the putative homologs ESTs in the VitisExpDB to
retrieve further information on interesting Arabidopsis
genes. In addition, a microarray data repository that will
include all the custom microarray data sets is under development.
Online tools
Several online tools, such as BLAST, CLUSTALW, Tandem
Repeats Finder (TRF), and Cluster, have been adapted to
interface with our database. Others, such as CAP3, and
other BioPHP modules (See Additional File 5), can be
accessed independently. Annotated Vitis databases, such
as EST and microarray probe sequence sets, have been
added to the BLAST database (Vitis full sequence BLAST db
and Vitis full array BLAST db) that will help the grape scientific community to quickly and efficiently identify and
annotate ESTs. The BLAST tool accepts either single or
multiple sequence files in a FASTA format. All the NCBI's
BLAST software features have been retained for familiarity
of use (Figure 5A, and see Additional file 6 for the full
image). The CLUSTALW tool can be used to align up to 20
sequences at a time and the user can input the GB accession for the sequences of interest as a comma separated
list, Figure 5B (see Additional file 6). Results files from
each run are saved with the user provided file name for
subsequent retrieval, Figure 5C (see Additional file 6). A
TRF search page has been developed where the user can
customize the search for repeats within a sequence as well
as try different search options, Figure 5D (see Additional
file 6). Output files are saved with the user input options
as prefix to avoid overwriting the files, Figure 5E (see
Additional file 6). This is significantly different from displaying static pages where pre-run data on tandem repeats
is displayed as in most of the EST databases, thereby missing the option of applying different search parameters on

a single EST sequence. For analysis of functionally related
genes based on their microarray expression profiles, the
latest Linux version of the XCluster software was configured [28]. The customized result files from the XCluster
can be downloaded onto local hard drives and stored for
future use. An EST sequence submission form has been
developed where users can submit their sequence directly
to the database. A conformation e-mail will be generated
alerting the submitter of a successful submission. The
added sequences will be annotated monthly, after carrying out quality control analysis, such as vector and adapter
contamination, and will be added to the main database
for later pubic retrieval. A link to the Web Page has been
provided on the left-hand side at the bottom of the main
Web Page that lists all the major and interesting Vitis EST
and genomic resource Web Pages.
In addition to having the most current EST data pool with
annotation and Gene Ontology curation, VitisExpDB also
has other unique features, such as information on putative homologs from different Vitis species, information on
their Arabidopsis putative homologs, integration of
microarray and EST databases, mapping of transcriptional
responses on to metabolic pathways and several data
analysis tools.

Conclusion
The VitisExpDB database is a valuable resource for broad
applications to Vitis genetics and breeding, genomics, proteomics and genome annotation. Future expansion plans
of the database include cataloging splice variants from the

ESTs, identifying full-length ESTs based on tentative consensus sequences that are backed up by the genomic data
and generation of genomic landscape maps of gene
expression. Development of cross reference tools for users
to compare data between Affymetrix gene chip array and
other custom arrays is also planned as a part of future
database expansion. The VitisExpDB database will be
updated frequently as and when more information
becomes available.
