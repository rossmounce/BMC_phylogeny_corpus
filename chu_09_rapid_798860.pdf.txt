Abstract
Background: Sequence alignment is the rate-limiting step in constructing profile trees for DNA
barcoding purposes. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of using unaligned rRNA sequences
as barcodes based on a composition vector (CV) approach without sequence alignment
(Bioinformatics 22:1690). Here, we further explored the grouping effectiveness of the CV method
in large DNA barcode datasets (COI, 18S and 16S rRNA) from a variety of organisms, including
birds, fishes, nematodes and crustaceans.
Results: Our results indicate that the grouping of taxa at the genus/species levels based on the
CV/NJ approach is invariably consistent with the trees generated by traditional approaches,
although in some cases the clustering among higher groups might differ. Furthermore, the CV
method is always much faster than the K2P method routinely used in constructing profile trees for
DNA barcoding. For instance, the alignment of 754 COI sequences (average length 649 bp) from
fishes took more than ten hours to complete, while the whole tree construction process using the
CV/NJ method required no more than five minutes on the same computer.
Conclusion: The CV method performs well in grouping effectiveness of DNA barcode
sequences, as compared to K2P analysis of aligned sequences. It was also able to reduce the
time required for analysis by over 15-fold, making it a far superior method for analyzing large
datasets. We conclude that the CV method is a fast and reliable method for analyzing large datasets
for DNA barcoding purposes.

Background
In 2003, Hebert et al [1] proposed to use a 648-bp region
from the 5’-end of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1
(COI) gene as a DNA barcode for identifying all
metazoan species. The final goal of DNA barcoding is
to identify all eukaryotic species [2,3]. Recently, DNA

barcoding has been tested on several groups of organisms including birds [4], fishes [5] and amphibians [6]
with promising results. Ratnasingham and Hebert [7]
estimated that the barcode of life data system (BOLD)
would eventually generate 100 million records (for COIbarcoding only) twice the current size of the GenBank

database, and that enterprise-scale software would be
needed to handle such a large dataset. The goal of BOLD
is to generate a “taxon ID tree” based on a neighbourjoining (NJ) algorithm for every query sequence for easy
identification. As in other traditional methods of tree
construction, sequence alignment has to be performed
before construction of the K2P/NJ-tree (i.e., a NJ tree
based on the Kimura-2-parameter, K2P, distance). In
BOLD, alignment is executed based on the hidden
Markov models [7]. Due to the high computational
burden involved, BOLD has unfortunately been unable
to incorporate all data records in constructing the K2P/
NJ tree. The short-term solution is to divide the large
barcode dataset into several “sub-projects” with a size
limit of 5,000 specimens each for analysis [7]. However,
as an estimated 200,000 additional barcode records will
be entered in the database each year [8], the limit of
5,000 specimens for each sub-project will be quickly
saturated because closely related taxa (sequences) should
not be divided into subsets but preferably analyzed
together. The long-term solution is therefore to develop
more efficient analytical methods as alternatives or
supplements for handling such a large dataset.
COI has several claims to be a suitable DNA barcode
marker, including ease in amplification across a wide
variety of organisms and provision of enough information to enable organisms to be identified to the species
level. But it also has its drawbacks, including inherent
risks due to maternal inheritance (noticeably failure in
detecting hybridization), the presence of pseudogenes
(numts), and its inconsistent evolutionary rate among
lineages [2,9,10]. These disadvantages continue to
disappoint biologists hoping to rely on single gene as
the sole marker for taxonomic identification [6,11,12].
The feasibility of using alternative and additional genes
as DNA barcodes has been explored [9,13,14]. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes and their internal transcribed
spacer (ITS) [6,15] show promise as DNA barcode
markers for distinguishing different organisms and, as
COI is highly conserved in plants, barcode markers such
as the trnH-psbA spacer and rbcL gene [9,11,16] have also
been proposed. Yet because of the high frequency of
insertions/deletions in the rRNA and the other nonprotein-coding markers, sequence alignment is a critical
step in the analysis. This, in turn, requires a large amount
of additional computational power during the alignment
step, further pushing the analytical power of BOLD
system toward its limit. The process of sequence
alignment is not only very costly in computational
power, but has also yet to be standardised. A lack of
standard protocols and inconsistencies between the
aligned datasets of different laboratories represent a
drawback [13,17-21] to the incorporation of any nonprotein-barcoding markers in BOLD. Including markers

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S14/S8

such as rRNA in BOLD would mean that alignment will
be executed automatically and any problems in alignment cannot be adjusted manually. The problems
associated with the alignment procedure effectively
limit the use of DNA barcoding [13].
Our previous study [13] demonstrated that the composition vector (CV) method [22] was an effective and
efficient tree construction method for analyzing rRNA
datasets, thereby facilitating the use of these genes as
DNA barcodes. We believe that the CV approach can also
sidestep the problems associated with sequence alignment in analyzing large datasets of both COI and nonprotein-coding barcode markers, the latter of which
usually involve sequence length variation even among
closely related taxa. In the present study, we analyzed
large DNA barcode datasets, each with more than 300
sequences (including non-COI datasets with variable
sequence lengths) with the CV method. Sequences from
three published DNA barcode datasets available from
GenBank, namely birds [23], fishes [5] and nematodes
[14], were analyzed. A 16S rRNA dataset of decapod
crustaceans containing 466 GenBank sequences and 268
sequences generated in our laboratory was also analyzed.
These datasets were chosen because they included the
most common genetic markers that have been proposed
as DNA barcodes, including COI, 16S rRNA and nuclear
SSU rRNA genes, and contained the largest number of
DNA sequences, ranging from 349 to 754, so far
assembled. The aim of our study was to evaluate how
well and how fast the CV method could handle these
large barcode datasets without sequence alignment.

Results
Bird dataset
The COI dataset of 263 North American bird species [23]
included 437 DNA sequences from 157 genera, 50
families and 20 orders (Table 1). In the K2P/NJ tree
(Figures 1 and 2), species from 18 orders could be
properly grouped, except that Falco peregrinus, F. columbarius, F. sparverius and Cathartes aura from the order
Falconiformes and Grus canadensis from the order
Gruiformes did not cluster with members of the same
order. At the family level, species from 45 families were
grouped respectively. All species could be correctly
grouped and identified at the genus/species level
(Table 2). In the CV/NJ tree (Figure 3), other than
species from the above two orders, members of two
other orders, Passeriformes and Ciconiiformes, could
not be grouped together. In the former, two taxa (of 180)
were clustered with members in the order Columbiformes, while one species (of four) from Ciconiiformes
was nested within the Gruiformes species. At the family
level, species from 43 families could be grouped

the K2P/NJ tree, species from two additional families

Oenanthe oenanthe, from the family Turdidae and three
species (out of 13), Melospiza georgiana, M. lincolnii and
M. melodia, from the Emberizidae could not be assigned
to their respective families. As in the K2P/NJ method, all
species could be grouped and identified at the genus/

649 bp from 4 classes, 14 orders, 49 families and 113
genera (Table 1). In the K2P/NJ tree (Figure 5), 42, 5, 1
and 1 species of the orders Perciformes (total 96 species),
Scorpaeniformes ‘(25 species)’ Rajiformes (21 species)
and Lamniformes (2 species) could not be grouped with
members of the same order, respectively. These former
orders also failed to be grouped accordingly in the CV/NJ
tree (Figure 6) but all species from the order Lamniformes could be successfully grouped together. Yet the
CV/NJ tree failed to assign Callorhinchus milii, a species of
Chimaeriformes (total 4 species included), to the clade
of this order. At the family level (Figure 7), four out of
the 49 families could not be grouped correctly in the
K2P/NJ tree. 4, 1, 1 and 1 species of the families
Dasyatididae (total 10 species), Percichthyidae (4
species), Sciaenidae (6 species) and Scorpidae (3 species)
could not be grouped with members from the same
family, respectively. In the CV/NJ tree (Figure 8),
members from six additional families failed to be
grouped properly. 1, 2, 3, 8, 2 and 2 species of the
families Myliobatidae (total 3 species), Platycephalidae
(14 species), Serranidae (24 species), Scombridae
(24 species), Scorpaenidae (5 species) and Triglidae
(5 species) could not be grouped with members from the
same family. As with the K2P/NJ tree, all 207 species
could be correctly discriminated and identified at the
genus/species level with the CV/NJ method (Table 2).
The CV method matched the resolving power of the

Nematode dataset
Holterman et al [14] used a small-subunit (SSU) rDNA
tree to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships in the
phylum Nematoda. The dataset of nearly full-length SSU
rDNA sequences (average length 1,693 bp) contained
339 ingroup taxa and ten outgroup taxa (Table 1). Based
on three phylogenetic reconstruction methods, including
Bayesian inference (BI), maximum parsimony (MP) and
NJ, the species could be separated into 12 major clades.
The CV/NJ tree (Figure 9) was also able to generate a
similar tree topology with the 12 clades, and successfully
assigned 326 (of 339) taxa into their respective clades
(Table 2), except two species in clade 1 (Adoncholaimus
sp. and Pontonema vulgare), two species from clade 2
(Trichinella spiralis and Trichuris muris), four species from
clade 9 (Aduncospiculum halicti, Pristionchus lheritieri,
Pristionchus pacificus and Rhabditoides inermis), five
species from clade 10 (Steinernema carpocapsae, Steinernema glaseri, Rhabditophanes sp., Strongloides ratti and
Strongyloides stercoralis) and one species from clade 11
(Brevibucca sp.). The four species from clades 1 and 2
were placed in the basal position in the CV/NJ tree while
the five species from clade 9 formed a sister group to the
group comprising clades 6 and 7. The five species in
clade 10 were clustered with Brevibucca sp. from clade 11.

Holterman et al [14], using traditional methods, were
not able to suggest a phylogenetic position of the family
Choanolaimidae. With the CV method, changing the K
value would alter the position of Choanolaimidae. For
instance, with the K value of 10 Choanolaimidae was
assigned into clade 1. When the K value dropped below
10, Choanolaimidae became a sister group to the group
comprising clades 3 and 4.

Decapod dataset
The 16S rRNA dataset of decapod crustaceans contained
734 sequences (each from one species) from eight
infraorders, 42 superfamilies, 86 families and 323 genera
(Table 1). The average sequence length was 450 bp. Both
the K2P/NJ and CV/NJ trees showed similar topologies,
and the relationships among the taxa were also highly
similar between the two trees. At the infraorder level,
neither tree could group the 134 Anomura species
together. In the K2P/NJ tree (Figure 10), species from
the infraorder Anomura were separated into three major
groups, while only two were evident in the CV/NJ tree
(K = 9). For the infraorder Astacidea, the CV/NJ tree
(Figure 11) separated the 27 species into two clades.
Although the K2P/NJ tree was able to group all these
species into a single clade, the clade also contained
species from two other infraorders, Thalassinidea and

Palinura. Neither tree was able to assign infraorders
Thalassinidea (15 species) and Palinura (28 species) as
reciprocal monophyletic groups. By contrast, all the
375 species from the infraorder Brachyura could be
successfully grouped in the K2P/NJ tree, while 11 of the
species could not be grouped with other members of this
infraorder by the CV/NJ method. In fact, the Brachyura
clade in the CV/NJ tree also contained a small number of
species from the infraorder Thalassinidea. By using the
K2P/NJ method, all 108 species from infraorder Caridea
could be successfully grouped as a single clade, while
three species could not be grouped into the Caridea
clade in the CV/NJ tree. At the family level, both the K2P
and CV methods showed a high resolving power in
assigning taxa to their respective families. With the K2P/
NJ method, only members from six families, viz.
Ocypodidae, Oplophoridae, Palaemonidae, Palinuridae,
Penaeidae and Potamonautidae, could not be grouped
respectively, out of a total of 86 families. Interestingly,
while species from Penaeidae could be grouped together
in the CV/NJ tree, members from two other families,
Atyidae and Gecarcinidae, failed to cluster together in
this tree. The overall grouping effectiveness of the K2P
and CV methods was comparable (Table 2).
Processing time
All the data analyses in this study were preformed on a
1.4 GHz notebook computer. With the K2P/NJ method,
the alignment step using CLUSTAL W [24] alone took
more than five hours to complete for the bird dataset,
and required more than 10 hours to complete for the
other three datasets (Table 2). When the other two faster
algorithms MAFFT [25] and MUSCLE [26] were used, the
processing time was reduced by 3.2 and 7.7 folds
respectively, so that between one and two hours were
needed for aligning the bird dataset. By contrast, with the
CV method it took less than three minutes to analyze
this bird dataset, and the analysis of the other three
datasets was completed in five minutes (Table 2). Thus,
while the CV/NJ method matched the resolving power of
the K2P/NJ method in generating a highly similar tree, it
took less than 6% of the time needed in sequence
alignment on the same computer.

Discussion
Qi et al [22] first introduced the CV method to analyze
the phylogeny of prokaryotes based on the complete
genomes, and this approach has subsequently been
applied to analyze the chloroplast genomes [13,27]. All
these studies were based on protein sequences, and a
procedure to subtract the random background from the
frequencies of oligopeptide strings was used before
computation of the CVs in order to diminish the
influence of random neutral mutations at the molecular

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S14/S8

level and to highlight the shaping role of selective
evolution. However, in adopting the CV method in
analyzing short rDNA sequences for barcoding, Chu et al
[13] have shown that a subtraction procedure for
random background does not further enhance the
reliability of the groupings. In the present study, we
focus on how well the CV method could handle large
DNA datasets, by comparing this method with the K2P/
NJ method in analyzing four datasets including both
rRNA and protein-coding genes. Although in each of the
four datasets tested the topologies between the CV/NJ
and K2P/NJ trees were not identical, this does not mean
that one method obtained better results than the other.
The rationale for generating the K2P/NJ trees in DNA
barcoding studies or in BOLD is that the K2P/NJ tree
construction is relatively simple [1], so that a query
sequence can be rapidly identified to the species level.
However, the K2P/NJ tree was not intended to reflect the
phylogenetic relationships among the taxa analyzed [5].
Thus any detailed comparison in tree topologies between
the CV and the K2P methods is meaningless. In fact,
both the CV and K2P methods performed equally well in
identifying and discriminating taxa at the genus/species
level in the datasets tested (Table 2).
The dataset of nematodes [14] was used to resolve the
phylogenetic relationships among the species, and three
different approaches (BI, MP and NJ) were applied.
However, the classification of nematodes based on the
molecular approach is never an easy task. The phylogenetic position of the family Choanolaimidae, for
example, could not be determined based on any of the
three approaches. Two species, Trichinella spiralis and
Trichuris muris, could only be assigned into clade 2 based
on the BI tree but not on the MP and NJ trees [14]. The
problem might be due to the inadequacy of the SSU
rDNA sequences in resolving the phylogeny of this
group. The evolutionary rates of this gene may also differ
among different nematode clades [14]. On the other
hand, Floyd et al [15] proposed to use the number of
SSU rDNA sequence differences to define “molecular
operational taxonomic units” rather than adopting the
classical species concepts in nematode biodiversity
studies. It is not surprising to find inconsistent tree
topologies based on different analytical methods,
including the CV method, from this nematode dataset.
In fact, the CV method could generate a tree topology
similar to those generated by the three phylogenetic
reconstruction methods, by clustering all of the taxa into
12 main clades (Table 2).
Besides its impressive resolving power, the main
advantage of the CV/NJ method over the K2P/NJ
algorithm is its speed. In every dataset analyzed in this
study, the CV/NJ method could generate trees in less

than five minutes on a 1.4 GHz notebook computer. The
time needed is at least 15-fold more using the K2P/NJ
method, which requires sequence alignment. Given its
high analytical speed, the CV method could profitably
serve as a quick barcoding identification tool capable of
matching a query sequence against a pre-installed
reference dataset from BOLD on a notebook computer
for field workers who may not have internet access. The
CV method not only saves time by omitting the
alignment step, but also avoids the introduction of any
human errors during the alignment process. Where no
universal alignment parameters can be defined, every
gap representing insertion/deletion that is assigned to a
DNA sequence should be checked by eye carefully, and
even this step might be subjective [19]. Manual checking
becomes a very tedious and laborious procedure when
dealing with a large dataset generated by multiple
alignments, but is a necessary step for verifying the
reliability of the dataset and its suitability for further
analysis. The CV method does away with this ratelimiting, tedious step in the tree construction procedure
for DNA barcoding.

Conclusion
The CV method was first demonstrated to facilitate the
use of rDNA datasets for barcoding purposes since no
sequence alignment was necessary [13]. In the present
study, we further demonstrated the power of the CV
method in analyzing large DNA barcode datasets,
regardless of the type of gene markers used. In all cases
tested, the CV/NJ method achieved tree topologies
similar to those based on the traditional methods
which involve sequence alignment, with compatible
grouping effectiveness. Furthermore, when the CV
method was used, the computational time was at least
15-fold shorter than that based on the K2P method.
Besides its effective resolving power and very fast speed
of analysis, the CV/NJ method can routinely generate
reliable and reproducible trees by eliminating human
errors in the multiple alignment process. To conclude,
we propose that the CV/NJ method can be used as an
effective and efficient tree construction algorithm in
analyzing DNA barcode datasets.

Methods
Sequences from three published datasets, including birds
[23], fishes [5] and nematodes [14] were downloaded
from GenBank for analysis. We also assembled a 16S
rRNA dataset of decapod crustaceans by including 466
sequences from GenBank and 268 sequences generated
in our laboratory. This dataset is available from the first
author upon request.
The principle and details of the composition vector (CV)
method have been fully described previously [13,22,28,29],

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S14/S8

and the program is publicly available at http://tlife.fudan.
edu.cn/cvtree. In short, for a sequence of gene of length L,
the frequency of the appearance of oligonucleotide strings
of a fixed length K was determined. The K value used for
each dataset was calculated by
[30] and it ranged
from 9 to 10 among the four datasets (Table 2). The total
number of N possible types of the K strings was 4K. The
frequency of each of the N kinds in a given DNA sequence
was determined. We then placed the frequencies of all
possible K-strings in a fixed order to obtain a CV of
dimension 4K for each sequence. The correlation C(A, B)
between two sequences A and B was determined by taking
the projection of one vector on another, and the distance
between the two was defined as D = (1 - C)/2. In this way,
the sequences difference could be quantitatively evaluated.
After constructing a distance matrix for all sequences in a
dataset, the neighbour-joining (NJ) [31] analysis implemented in Phylip 3.63 [32] was used to construct a profile
tree for each dataset. The CV/NJ trees were then compared
with the corresponding K2P/NJ trees constructed as follows.
The DNA sequences in each dataset were first aligned using
the multiple alignment program CLUSTAL W 1.5c [24], and
the NJ trees were constructed using Mega 3 [33] based on the
Kimura-2-parameter distance model [34]. We also
attempted to align the sequences using two other algorithms, MAFFT [25] and MUSCLE [26]. All the computation
was performed using a 1.4 GHz notebook computer with
512 MB of RAM.
