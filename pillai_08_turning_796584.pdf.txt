Abstract
APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F are human cytidine deaminases that serve as innate antiviral defense
mechanisms primarily by introducing C-to-U changes in the minus strand DNA of retroviruses
during replication (resulting in G-to-A mutations in the genomic sense strand sequence). The HIV1 Vif protein counteracts this defense by promoting the proteolytic degradation of APOBEC3G and
APOBEC3F in the host cell. In the absence of Vif expression, APOBEC3 is incorporated into HIV1 virions and the viral genome undergoes extensive G-to-A mutation, or "hypermutation", typically
rendering it non-viable within a single replicative cycle. Consequently, Vif is emerging as an
attractive target for pharmacological intervention and therapeutic vaccination. Although a highly
effective Vif inhibitor may result in mutational meltdown of the viral quasispecies, a partially
effective Vif inhibitor may accelerate the evolution of drug resistance and immune escape due to
the codon structure and recombinogenic nature of HIV-1. This hypothesis rests on two principal
assumptions which are supported by experimental evidence: a) there is a dose response between
intracellular APOBEC concentration and degree of viral hypermutation, and, b) HIV-1 can tolerate
an elevated mutation rate, and a true error or extinction threshold is as yet undetermined.
Rigorous testing of this hypothesis will have timely and critical implications for the therapeutic
management of HIV/AIDS, and delve into the complexities underlying the induction of lethal
mutagenesis in a viral pathogen.

Commentary
The evolutionary potential of HIV-1 is unquestionably
one of the key factors underlying its extreme resilience in
the face of host immunity and antiretroviral drug pressure. RNA viruses in general have high mutation rates, and
HIV-1 is not an exception with an estimated rate of 3.4 ×
10-5 mutations/site/generation, owing to the poor fidelity
of reverse transcriptase and a lack of proofreading
machinery [1]. In addition, recombination is rampant
within HIV populations, and several reports suggest that it
may be an even more powerful force in shaping HIV evo-

lutionary patterns than mutation. Rates approaching 10
crossovers per replication cycle have been observed within
in vitro systems [2]. The true magnitude of these evolutionary processes becomes apparent when discussed in
the context of HIV population biology. Stochastic models
suggest that 1010 viral particles are produced each day
within an infected individual, and generation time is in
the neighborhood of 1.8 days [3]. This rate of production
and turnover coupled with the aforementioned rates of
recombination and mutation allow the virus to explore
vast reaches of sequence space in short periods of time.

The evolutionary wizardry of HIV-1 comes at a substantial
cost to the virus. The majority of viral particles are
believed to be non-infectious due to genetic anomalies
and assembly defects, reflecting the haphazard nature of
the replication process [4]. Multiple reports suggest that
the HIV-1 proviral DNA population in infected individuals is primarily composed of heavily mutated, replication
incompetent genomes [5,6]. The mutation rate of HIV-1
may in fact walk a very narrow line between requisite
evolvability (to avoid annihilation in a highly dynamic
and treacherous environment) and requisite fidelity (to
avoid population collapse resulting from a surfeit of deleterious mutations). Therefore, it has been hypothesized
that even a marginal increase in the mutation rate of HIV1 will result in genetic meltdown of the viral quasispecies,
a phenomenon known as "error catastrophe" [7,8]. The
induction of error catastrophe as an antiviral strategy has
been explored extensively in the laboratory, but as of yet,
this "lethal mutagenesis" approach has not been utilized
in a clinical setting to manage HIV infection [9,10]. The
treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection
with the ribonucleoside ribavirin may be an example of
lethal mutagenesis [11], although the extensively characterized immunomodulatory activity of ribavirin suggests
that non-mutagenic mechanisms likely contribute to its
antiviral potency [12]. Nevertheless, there is an undeniable musicality associated with transforming the virus'
greatest strength into its Achilles heel, and there is a pronounced need for novel therapeutic strategies due to
resistance and toxicity issues surrounding existing antiretroviral agents.
A recent major development in the HIV research world
involving an endogenous host-encoded mutagen has
brought the concept of lethal mutagenesis to center stage.
Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic
polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) was found to serve as
an innate antiviral defense mechanism by introducing Cto-U changes in the minus strand DNA of retroviruses during replication (resulting in G-to-A mutations in the
genomic sense strand sequence) [13]. Soon thereafter,
surveys of the entire APOBEC cytidine deaminase family
revealed that another member, APOBEC3F, exhibits similar antiviral potency and cDNA editing capacities [14].
The HIV-1 genome, however, encodes the 23 kilodalton
protein Vif (virion infectivity factor) which specifically
counteracts this defense by promoting the proteolytic degradation of APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F in the host cell
(and perhaps by inhibiting the translation of these host
factors as well) [15-17]. In the absence of Vif expression,
APOBEC3 is incorporated into virions and the viral
genome undergoes extensive G-to-A mutation, or "hypermutation", typically rendering it non-viable within a single replicative cycle. Consequently, Vif is emerging as an

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/26

attractive target for pharmacological intervention and
therapeutic vaccination [18-21].
Our experience with current antiretrovirals suggests that a
Vif antagonist will most likely be less than 100% effective
at suppressing Vif activity, due to pharmacokinetic limitations, the presence of anatomic compartments with poor
drug penetration characteristics (e.g. central nervous system), and the seemingly inevitable evolution of partial
drug resistance [22]. Therefore, the possibility exists that
incomplete Vif suppression will elevate intracellular
APOBEC3 concentrations just enough to exert an intermediate (sub-error catastrophe) level of mutational pressure
on the HIV-1 genome, accelerating viral evolution without inducing population collapse (Fig. 1). This scenario is
supported by features of the HIV-APOBEC3 interaction
which have been elucidated by careful and detailed experimental work:
There is a dose response between intracellular APOBEC
concentrations and degree of viral hypermutation
Based on data from in vitro cytidine deaminase assays, the
extent of hypermutation (average number of G-to-A
mutations per target sequence) is directly proportional to
cellular APOBEC3G concentration [23]. If hypermutation
was an all-or-nothing binary phenomenon, and APOBEC
levels were only correlated with the overall number of
viral genomes that were subject to hypermutation, there
would be little cause for concern. However, experimental
data demonstrate convincingly that both the overall
number of sequences and the number of deaminated sites
within each sequence scale with APOBEC concentration.
Analysis of HIV-1 sequence data from infected individuals
provides additional circumstantial evidence of an
APOBEC dose effect. Complete genome sequences
labeled as "hypermutants" (a designation which is rather
arbitrary at this point) in the Los Alamos HIV Database
vary quite dramatically in apparent levels of G-to-A substitution, both between and within viruses [24]. Some
hypermutants are littered with canonical APOBECinduced mutations and appear to be evolutionary dead
ends, while others are barely distinguishable from nonhypermutant control sequences and may in fact represent
replication competent viruses. The APOBEC dose effect is
also apparent within each individual hypermutant
sequence; there is a pronounced 5' to 3' mutational gradient, reflecting the length of time that the single-stranded
DNA intermediate is exposed and accessible to deaminase
activity during the reverse transcription process [24,25].
These observations are complemented and reinforced by
the apparent stoichiometry of APOBEC3G in virions.
Each delta-vif virion is believed to incorporate between
3–11 molecules of APOBEC3G [26], dependent on the
presence of viral genomic RNA in the forming virion [27],
and varying in tandem with intracellular concentrations

Potential consequences of a hypothetical HIV-1 Vif-based intervention
Potential consequences of a hypothetical HIV-1 Vif-based intervention. A highly potent Vif antagonist should significantly elevate intracellular concentrations of APOBEC3, inducing the desired end goal of viral error catastrophe (red zone). A
moderately effective Vif inhibitor may fail to induce mutational meltdown and instead accelerate evolution of drug resistance,
immune escape, and coreceptor phenotype (yellow zone). A weak inhibitor should invoke a level of mutational pressure that
falls into the range of natural variation resulting from genetic polymorphisms in Vif and the APOBEC3 loci (green zone).

of APOBEC3G in the producer cell [26]. Multiple reports
demonstrate that APOBEC3G is catalytically active and
has antiviral potency as a monomer. The monomeric
capacity of APOBEC3G makes the range of 3–11 molecules per virion meaningful, and likely consequential
[28,29].
HIV-1 can tolerate an elevated mutation rate, and a true
upper limit (error or extinction threshold) is as yet
undetermined
Ample evidence suggests that HIV-1 populations may be
able to withstand substantial increases in mutation rate
without experiencing complete genetic meltdown. For
example, AZT and 3TC treatment, as well as the mutations
in reverse transcriptase that confer resistance to AZT,
increase the HIV-1 error rate in vivo by several-fold without extinguishing the virus in the near-term. Replication
of AZT-resistant viruses in vitro in the presence of agents
like hydroxyurea and thymidine that create imbalances in
deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools similarly
increases mutation rate without destroying viability [30].
Although numerous mutagenesis studies describe signifi-

cant decreases in viral fitness, titre, or infectivity as a result
of mutational burden, it is unclear if these data legitimately embody the precise mathematical prerequisites of
impending error catastrophe [8,10,31,32]. More importantly, extinction – that is, a detectable end to HIV replication – is rarely reported as an outcome of these
experiments.
Incomplete Vif inhibition and the resulting enhancement
of APOBEC3-mediated mutational pressure on the HIV-1
genome may accelerate evolution of antiretroviral resistance [33], immune escape, and cellular tropism (coreceptor usage phenotype). We can initially estimate the
likelihood of these outcomes by considering the codon
structure of HIV-1 and the distribution of APOBEC3G and
APOBEC3F target sequence motifs across the HIV-1 proteome. APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F principally target
"GG" (GG->AG) and "GA" (GA->AA) dinucleotides,
respectively [25,34]. Let us consider the HIV-1 subtype B
Protease consensus sequence as an example (Fig. 2). 35 of
the 99 amino acids in Protease are typically encoded by
codons that contain one or both of these dinucleotide tar-

get motifs. Of these 35 APOBEC3-susceptible amino
acids, 19 are contained within recognized cytotoxic T cell
(CTL) epitope sequences, and 10 are sites involved in
resistance against protease inhibitor drugs [35]. Even
when focusing on the frequency and distribution of
APOBEC3 target motifs within a single HIV-1 protein, it is
readily apparent that a partial Vif phenotype is likely to
modulate viral susceptibility to host immunity and drug
pressure.
We extended our thought experiment on Protease by performing an in silico exercise to investigate the relationship

between enhanced APOBEC3-mediated mutational pressure and evolution of antiviral resistance. We implemented forward simulations of HIV-1 pol evolution under
varying APOBEC3-induced mutation rates (coded in SAS
version 9.1), focusing on the emergence of amino acid
replacements at established protease inhibitor resistance
sites [35]. Simulations were seeded with 10,000 copies of
an HIV-1 consensus B pol sequence derived from all available subtype B data in the Los Alamos Database. Background evolution and diversification was modeled by
applying a base mutation rate of 3.4*10-5 substitutions/
site/cycle [1] to a full 12-term substitution rate matrix

inferred from a phylogeny of intrapatient pol sequences.
APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F target dinucleotide motifs
were mutated randomly each cycle at rates from 0.0001 to
0.05 (GG -> AG, GA -> AA). Sequences with premature
stop codons were removed from the population at the end
of each generation. Simulations were allowed to run up to
200 generations (approximately 1 year assuming an HIV1 generation time of ~1.8 days) or until natural extinction
due to depletion of viable sequences.
Rates of population extinction in our simulations varied
tremendously between and even within APOBEC3 mutation rates, due to the stochastic distribution of mutations
across sites and the fact that only one single codon
("TGG") at position 42 of the protease sequence is converted to a stop codon by APOBEC3 editing. Protease
inhibitor resistance mutations were observed most frequently when APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F dinucleotide
target motifs were mutated at rates of 0.001 to 0.01. Below
a rate of 0.001, mutational patterns essentially reflected
the background evolutionary model, and above 0.01,
populations tended to collapse rapidly due to the accrual
of stop codons. These results probably underestimate the
potential for APOBEC-driven resistance evolution, due to
the absence of recombination and drug-mediated positive
selection pressure in our model [36-38]. Recombination
should increase the sustainability of heavily mutated populations by providing a means of purging stop codons and
escaping the irreversible accumulation of deleterious
mutations associated with asexual reproduction known as
Muller's ratchet [39]. Emulation of the selective environment associated with drug treatment (accounting for the
selective advantage conferred by Protease inhibitor resistance mutations) would favor the maintenance and fixation of polymorphisms that reduce drug susceptibility.
Nonetheless, this reductionist modeling exercise reinforces the notion that a highly effective Vif inhibitor may
result in mutational meltdown or extinction of the HIV-1
quasispecies, while a weaker inhibitor may accelerate evolution of drug resistance and other undesirable viral phenotypic characteristics.
The results of our simulation are mirrored in naturally
occurring HIV-1 protease sequences in the Los Alamos
Database [40]. A survey of all available patient-derived
subtype B protease sequences from documented hypermutant genomes demonstrates that mutations at recognized protease inhibitor resistance positions are
ubiquitous (Fig. 3). Nearly all of the hypermutant protease sequences have multiple non-synonymous mutations at resistance codons, all of which result from G-to-A
substitutions (many of these amino acid replacements are
not typically associated with resistance, but variation at
these sites may impact mutational pathways and modulate viral susceptibility to antiretroviral agents to some

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/26

degree). Several of the severely hypermutated sequences,
however, contain a single premature stop codon at position 42 and most likely represent non-functional proteins.
Such non-functional gene variants in the proviral population may still contribute to the mean fitness and stability
of the HIV-1 quasispecies by serving as a repository of
genetic information, available for future recombination
with replication competent genomes. The array of
observed nucleotide mutations confirms earlier observations that hypermutants exhibit a wide range of APOBEC3
editing intensities [24,41]; a few of the hypermutant
genomes contain zero G-to-A substitutions in protease,
while others have up to fifty (~75% of available G's
mutated to A). Certain positions tend to be targeted across
genomes and may represent previously described mutational "hotspots", where upstream nucleotides at the -1
and -2 positions favor cytidine deaminase activity [25].
Interestingly, some sequences appear to be mainly
affected by APOBEC3F deaminase activity (cyan hash
marks), while others are principally targeted and edited by
APOBEC3G (red marks), suggesting that these mutational
pressures vary independently in nature. These data demonstrate that moderately hypermutated sequences that
have been subjected to intermediate levels of APOBEC3
pressure exist naturally, and moreover, these sequences
often possess multiple mutations of pharmacological and
immunological significance. An additional summary of
observed APOBEC3-induced mutations at recognized
resistance sites in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase is provided
in Table 1.
Perhaps the most provocative empirical evidence that the
HIV-1 quasispecies may benefit from enhanced APOBECmediated mutational pressure is the prevalence of naturally occurring partially defective Vif variants. Patientderived Vif variants are frequently deficient in their abilities to neutralize APOBEC3G and/or APOBEC3F, and
viral sequences from these individuals exhibit mutational
profiles that are consistent with their respective susceptibilities to these host factors [41,42]. Many of the observed
Vif mutations affecting function are themselves the result
of G-to-A transitions within canonical APOBEC3 dinucleotide motifs, suggestive of a feedback loop between Vif
sequence and APOBEC3 editing [42]. The overall highly
adenine-biased base composition and codon usage of
HIV-1 may in fact reflect adaptation to APOBEC-mediated
mutational pressure [25]. These observations are complemented by population-level analyses of APOBEC3 expression and an unexpected detail regarding a natural
polymorphism in the APOBEC3G locus. There does not
appear to be any correlation between levels of APOBEC3
expression (mRNA) in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells and HIV viral loads or CD4+ counts in untreated
HIV-infected individuals [43], although a more rigorous
study design may be required to adequately address this

relationship [44]. The H186R APOBEC3G allelic variant is
associated with accelerated HIV disease progression, and
actually appears to have slightly increased antiviral
potency based on in vitro infectivity data (cytidine deaminase activity was not directly measured) [45]. Taken
together, these data strongly suggest that the HIV-1 quasispecies conveniently exploits APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F
as engines of genetic diversification. The virus essentially
uses Vif sequence as a volume knob to modulate its sus-

ceptibility to cytidine deaminase activity in the host, analogous to the role of mutator alleles in bacterial
populations.
In conclusion, given the dim prospects for an HIV vaccine
in the near future [46], complete or near complete neutralization of Vif activity is a promising therapeutic strategy that may provide a much-needed alternative to
existing treatment options. However, there are clues scat-

tered throughout the literature that therapeutic strategies
targeting the Vif-APOBEC interaction may benefit virus
rather than host, and therefore should not be executed
without the greatest of caution and forethought. Inadvertent effects of partial Vif inhibition could include the
development of drug resistance to other members of an
antiretroviral regimen, or loss of immune control due to
accelerated evolution of epitope escape mutations. The
potential outcome of a Vif-based intervention should be
examined systematically and rigorously in vitro and in silico prior to clinical deployment. Long-term serial passaging of HIV-1 in the presence of scaled APOBEC3
concentrations using variable population sizes, cellular
activation states, and environmental challenges (e.g. drug
exposure) should yield invaluable insight into the likelihood of treatment success. In addition, the effects of a Vifbased intervention should be explored virtually by implementing a sophisticated simulation that incorporates
recombination, positive selection, and realistic population dynamics into the underlying model. On a different
note, there are emerging subtleties and complexities associated with the HIV-APOBEC3 relationship that may open
up additional avenues for therapeutic intervention that
fall outside of the lethal mutagenesis realm. Antiviral
potency has recently been attributed to both APOBEC3G
and APOBEC3F that is distinct and separable from cytidine deaminase activity [47-49], although the legitimacy
of this capacity is still a topic of debate [50]. A therapeutic
scheme that selectively amplifies this non-mutagenic antiviral phenotype without enhancing cytidine deamination
may be an effective alternate route to suppression of viral
replication.
