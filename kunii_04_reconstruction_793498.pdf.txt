Abstract
Background: Plant genomes contain various kinds of repetitive sequences such as transposable
elements, microsatellites, tandem repeats and virus-like sequences. Most of them, with the
exception of virus-like sequences, do not allow us to trace their origins nor to follow the process
of their integration into the host genome. Recent discoveries of virus-like sequences in plant
genomes led us to set the objective of elucidating the origin of the repetitive sequences.
Endogenous rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV)-like sequences (ERTBVs) have been found
throughout the rice genome. Here, we reconstructed putative virus structures from RTBV-like
sequences in the rice genome and characterized to understand evolutionary implication, integration
manner and involvements of endogenous virus segments in the corresponding disease response.
Results: We have collected ERTBVs from the rice genomes. They contain rearranged structures
and no intact ORFs. The identified ERTBV segments were shown to be phylogenetically divided into
three clusters. For each phylogenetic cluster, we were able to make a consensus alignment for a
circular virus-like structure carrying two complete ORFs. Comparisons of DNA and amino acid
sequences suggested the closely relationship between ERTBV and RTBV. The Oryza AA-genome
species vary in the ERTBV copy number. The species carrying low-copy-number of ERTBV
segments have been reported to be extremely susceptible to RTBV. The DNA methylation state
of the ERTBV sequences was correlated with their copy number in the genome.
Conclusions: These ERTBV segments are unlikely to have functional potential as a virus.
However, these sequences facilitate to establish putative virus that provided information underlying
virus integration and evolutionary relationship with existing virus. Comparison of ERTBV among
the Oryza AA-genome species allowed us to speculate a possible role of endogenous virus
segments against its related disease.

Background
The virus-like sequences that have been found in plant
genomes are divided into two groups of plant viruses, single-stranded DNA geminivirus and double-stranded DNA
pararetroviruses. The geminivirus segments, including the
viral replication origin and the adjacent AL1 gene, have
been found in the genomes of tobacco and its related species [1,2]. Pararetrovirus-like sequences have been
reported in the petunia [3,4] banana [5-7] and tobacco
genomes [8-10]. Compared to the intact virus sequences,
most of the endogenous virus-like sequences were rearranged in the host genomes. Their rearranged structures
suggested that illegitimate recombination may have
occurred when putative virus progenitors integrated [11].
The endogenous viruses for banana streak virus (BSV) [6],
tobacco vein-clearing virus (TVCV) [9] and petunia vein
clearing-virus (PVCV) [4] could be activated as episomal
viruses under certain conditions in the host plant, and
appeared to have pathogenic potential. The integrations
of these viruses were shown to have been relatively recent
events and the copy numbers of the endogenous virus
sequences were found to be very low. On the other hand,
for tobacco endogenous pararetroviruses (TEPRVs), it was
estimated that there are about 1000 segments in the
tobacco genome [8], but the intact virus has not been
identified so far, suggesting that the integration of TEPRVs
was not a recent event. The finding of such endogenous
virus sequences raises questions concerning 1) the integration process giving rise to endogenous virus sequences, 2)
possible differences in the evolutionary rate between the
virus and endogenous virus and 3) resistance potential as
a result of endogenous virus integration.
In the rice genome, pararetrovirus-like sequences that are
similar to rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) have also
been found [12-14]. In South and Southeast Asia, rice tungro bacilliform virus, which is transmitted by green leafhoppers, causes one of the most serious diseases of rice
with the assistance of rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV)
[15]. Kobayashi and Ikeda [16] reported that African rice
species, Oryza glaberrima and O. barthii, showed much
severer systemic necrosis compared to the other rice species present in South and Southeast Asia after inoculation
of both RTBV and RTSV.
Here, we have characterized RTBV-like sequences in the
Japonica (cv. Nipponbare) genome. These sequences,
denoted endogenous RTBV-like sequences (ERTBVs),
were highly rearranged and dispersed throughout the rice
genome. Sequences of the putative viruses for ERTBV were
reconstructed from the dispersed segment in the genome.
Copy numbers of ERTBV segments are shown to vary
among AA-genome Oryza species. Asian species have
more ERTBV segments than the species originated from
the other regions where RTBV is not distributed. The

results obtained advance our understanding of the manner of integration of authentic pararetrovirus into the host
genome, evolutionary implication of the integrated virus
and possible involvement of endogenous virus segments
in the corresponding disease resistance.

Results
Identification of RTBV-like sequences in the rice genomes
Previously, we found a repetitive sequence near the rice
waxy gene, which is partially homologous to the rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) genome [12,17]. A probe of
this segment hybridized to about 30 bands in EcoRIdigested fragments from both Japonica and Indica
genomic DNAs [12]. In the present study, we collected 29
RTBV-like sequences from the rice genome databases for
Japonica (cv. Nipponbare). The segments collected here
had ample length for further analyses. The segments of
ERTBV were distributed throughout the rice genome.
Structural differences among the collected ERTBV segments appeared to be due to rearrangements of the segments including deletions, insertions, inversions and
duplications. None of the segments had the same structure as the virus or seemed likely to be active as virus.
However, the similarities among the ERTBV segments
were scored as more than 80% (described in detail in
below), so that each homologous part in the ERTBV segments was easily recognized. Most of the ERTBV segments
are flanked by AT-repeated sequences (Table 1), which
might be involved in the integration mechanism.
Assembling ERTBV segments
We sorted out the 29 ERTBV segments using the sequences
homologous to the RT gene, which is encoded in the end
of ORF 3. Similarity analyses based on the RT gene
grouped them into three clusters (Figure 1 and Table 1),
suggesting the presence of three independent ERTBV
sequence families. The discontinuity of the three clusters
allows us to predict independent integration events for
each of the ERTBVs into certain rice species genome(s).
We then attempted reconstruction of the complete ERTBVs from the three clusters present in the phylogenetic
tree. Approximately 7.5-kb circular virus-like structures
could be reconstituted by assembling common parts in
individual ERTBVs. The assembled virus-like sequences,
which are designated as ERTBV-A, -B and -C, encode
potentially functional ORFs. The nucleotide similarities
among ERTBVs range from 82% to 93%, and therefore the
segments are clearly distinguished in any of the clusters.
Of the four ORFs in RTBV, ORF 3 and 4 correspond to
ORF y and z of ERTBVs, but ORF 2 is absent from ERTBVs
(Figure 2A). Nucleotide sequence of ORF 1 showed a 49%
of homology to Region x of ERTBVs, while we failed to
find ORF from the Region x sequences (Figure 2A).
Pararetroviruses form a circular double-stranded DNA
genome (Figure 2B), therefore, it is reasonable to believe

that the authentic ERTBV viruses had a similar structure. It
seems that the integration of ERTBVs did not occur randomly since more than a half of the ERTBV ends connected with rice genomic DNA were in the putative
intergenic region (IGR) (Figure 2B). In addition, the other
common junctions are found in the middle of ORF y (Figure. 2B), which corresponds to the location of the discontinuities in the open circular form of RTBV [18]. These
structures may indicate that the integration process
occurred after the reverse transcription of the virus
genome.
The longest ORF in RTBV, ORF 3 encodes the movement
protein (MP), coat protein (CP), asparatic protease (PR),
RT and RNase H (RH) in the single polycistronic mRNA
[19]. ORF 3 mostly parallels ORF y in ERTBV-A, -B and -C.
Similarities within these nucleotide sequences between
the RTBV and ERTBVs were around 50%. The amino acid
identity of the genes in ORF 3 ranged from 63% for RT/RH
to 40% for PR genes. With respect to RT and RH genes in
ORF 3, all characteristic motifs and invariant amino acids
for individual genes were preserved in the corresponding
ORF in each consensus ERTBV (Figure 3). Therefore, the
putative genes in consensus ERTBVs potentially encode
proteins comparable to those in RTBV.
To evaluate the genetic relationship of ERTBVs and RTBV,
RT amino acid sequences from the viruses belonging to
Caulimoviridae, were compared. Using the PHYLIP package program [20], the phylogenetic tree was constructed
for 14 kinds of viruses in Caulimoviridae (Figure 4). RTBV
and ERTBV-A -B and -C were found to be most closely
located in the RT peptides dendrogram among the Caulimoviridae viruses. These results strongly suggest that ERTBVs are virus in origin and are closely related with RTBV.

No sequences exactly matching RTBV per se were found in
the databases for Japonica cv. Nipponbare. We conducted
Southern hybridization analysis to see whether RTBVhomologous sequences are present in 14 lines from Oryza
AA-genome species (Table 1). The hybridization patterns
probed with RTBV sequence resulted in faint and indistinct bands (data not shown).
Periods of integration of ERTBV segments into the rice
genome
To investigate the periods of integration of ERTBV, we
attempted to obtain ERTBV sequences from an Indica variety (cv. IR36) using the RTBV-like sequence near the waxy
locus as a probe. We thereby isolated three clones carrying
ERTBV-homologous sequences (Table 1). Indica clone,
AB124591, was found to have the same ERTBV sequence
as that found in Nipponbare accession AL606592 (Table
1), indicating that the ERTBV integration events occurred
before the Japonica-Indica differentiation. The other two
Indica clones do not correspond with any ERTBV segments from Nipponbare.

Except for the sequences examined here, we could not
find any other RTBV-like sequences in database searches
using RTBV nor each of ERTBVs sequences as queries.
Therefore, a fourth cluster of the RTBV-like sequences is
unlikely to be present. The integration of ERTBV or its
derived segments after the differentiation of Japonica and
Indica cultivars thus seems to have not occurred.
Distribution of ERTBVs in the Oryza AA-genome species
To test whether other Oryza species contain ERTBV in their
genomes, Southern blotting experiments were performed
with 14 lines of the Oryza AA-genome species. A PCR
fragment of the 7.4-kb ERTBV sequence from chromosome 10 was prepared as a probe, and Figure 5 shows the
discrete bands and varying copy numbers revealed by the

7499 bp in length, respectively. Their assembled sequences consist of intergenic region (IGR) (A: 1–1114; 1114 bp, B: 1–1066;
1066 bp: C: 1–1063; 1063 bp), Region x (A: 1115–1600; 486 bp, B: 1067–1552; 486 bp, C: 1064–1558; 495 bp), ORF y (A:
1570–6702; 5133 bp, B: 1519–6672; 5154 bp; C: 1525–6678; 5154 bp) and ORF z (A: 6702–7523; 822 bp, B: 6672–7493; 822
bp, C: 6678–7496; 819 bp). Identical organizations of ORFs and their orders were observed in their structures. The nucleotide
sequence for Region x corresponds with ORF 1, but ATGs for initiation codon were not present. ORF 3 contains movement
protein (MP), coat protein (CP), asparatic protease (PR) and RNase H (RT/RH) [19]. B: Schematic representation of the junction sites of the ERTBV segments adjoining the rice genomic sequence. The junctions are indicated by vertical bars on the circular virus form of ERTBV. The figure shows the number of junctions of all the examined segments referred to Table 1. The

some of which showed common sizes among the lines.
An Australian rice (O. meridionalis) and two O. longistaminata accessions showed middle-copy numbers (approximately 10–20) of the ERTBV segments. In O. glaberrima,
O. barthii and O. glumaepatula accessions, only a few

bands hybridized to ERTBV; this may also be caused by
divergence of the ERTBV sequence and not only due to
lower copy numbers of the sequence. Especially in These

Methylation of ERTBV in Oryza AA-genome species
Since high-copy-number sequences generally tend to have
a heavier methylation state than low-copy-number

sequences, we investigated the methylation state of
ERTBVs in several Oryza species with various copy numbers. The methylation states were analyzed by Southern
blotting method using a methylation-sensitive enzyme,
HpaII, and a partially methylation-sensitive isoschizomer,
MspI. The 7.4-kb probe was employed to examine the
methylation states of the ERTBV in the Oryza AA-genome

species. The blotting patterns of O. sativa (Shimokita), O.
rufipogon (W1954), O. longistaminata (W1034), O. meridionalis (W1625), O. barthii (W1592), O. glumaepatula
(W1185) showed differences of methylation state
depending on the ERTBV copy number (Figure 6). In the
high-copy-number species, O. sativa and O. rufipogon, the
MspI and HpaII digests of DNA clearly showed different
digestion patterns, and in particular, most of the small
bands in the MspI digests were not observed in the HpaII
digests, indicating that these ERTBV sequences were considerably methylated. Although the results of blotting for
the middle-copy-number species, O. longistaminata and O.
meridionalis, also showed the presence of methylcytosine
within their ERTBV sequences, some bands in the MspI
digests were shared with the HpaII digests. Preferential
digestion of DNA from the low-copy-number species, O.
barthii and O. glumaepatula, compared to DNA from the
other species was observed. The above results indicate that
the copy number of the ERTBV sequences in the Oryza
genomes is correlated with the methylation level. A chloroplast DNA fragment [22] was used as a control probe to
confirm the completeness of digestions (data not shown).

Discussion
Completion of ERTBV via integration of the virus
Our data suggest that the putative virus for ERTBVs has
been integrated into the Oryza genomes at least three
times. These putative viruses are thought to be closely
related to RTBV and to form circular double-stranded
DNA. Cleavage of circular DNA molecules or open circular forms should be required for integration of the infecting virus. One of the preferential cleavage sites of ERTBV
was mapped within a putative promoter segment of the
authentic ERTBV sequence. Integrated sequences of TPVL
in tobacco [8] and hepatitis B (hepadna) virus in human
liver [23] were also found to have preferred junctions with
their host genomes at a similar region to that seen in
ERTBV. Jakowitsch et al. [8] proposed that the open circular form of the virus during the process of replication was
involved in integration, and the free ends of the virus
DNA molecule might contribute to integration or recombination. The ends of the ERTBV segments likely correspond with IGR and the putative discontinuities of RTBV
(Figure 2B), which possibly functions in transcription and
replication initiation or in the priming of DNA strand synthesis [18]. This fact accords with Jakowitschs' idea that
the preferential integration occurred while the virus was in
the process of replication (Figure 7). In addition to the
preferred sites for integration within the virus DNA, we
found that 93% of the ERTBV ends were flanked by ATrepeated sequences. This high probability of the presence
of AT-repeated sequences adjoining ERTBV led us to postulate that the AT tracks have facilitated or are associated
with integration of the virus DNA into the host genome
(Figure 7). Transgenes introduced by particle bombard-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/80

ment into the Arabidopsis genome were preferentially
delivered to AT-rich scaffold/matrix-attached region (S/
MAR)-like sequences [24,25]. SINE integration sites in the
Brassica genome show strong affinity for S/MAR-like
sequences [26]. Similar processes accounting for these
two instances might also function in the case of integration of the virus for ERTBV. Our data alone, however, are
unable to distinguish between whether ERTBV integrated
into the AT-repeat sequences or whether ERTBV accompanied the AT-repeat sequences in their integration (Figure
7).
Relationship between ERTBV and RTBV
Although the genomes of ERTBV and RTBV are structurally similar, particularly in the longest ORF, some regions
are markedly different. Phylogenetically, both are apparently closely related viruses. One important question is
whether or not ERTBV is a cognate of RTBV. ERTBVs
existed in the Oryza AA-genome species before differentiation of Japonica and Indica. Considering this evolutionary period, two possible relationships of RTBV and ERTBV
might be predicted: one is that the virus that was to
become ERTBV was a direct progenitor of RTBV, and the
other is that both were differentially branched from a
common ancestral virus. Because the evolution of virus
genomes is generally much faster than that of plant
genomes, we cannot compare them equivalently. In fact,
rapid evolution of RTBV was inferred from high level of
genetic diversity of RTBV field isolates [27]. Even in a
single field in the Philippines, more than one RTBV isolate
could be observed, and the genotype changes year by year.
Comparison of the sequences of several different isolates
revealed evidence for incidences of nucleotide substitution, insertion/deletion and recombination occurred during differentiation of RTBV isolates [28]. Particularly, it
was suggested that recombination had played a role in the
evolution of RTBV [29]. If ERTBV is a direct progenitor of
RTBV, recombination events might have contributed as a
driving force to establish the present RTBV form. The longest ORF (ORF 3) of RTBV is functionally essential [30] and
is thought to have been conserved since ERTBVs were
present as viruses, but the other less homologous
segments might have gradually undergone substitution by
recombination. If RTBV was derived from the virus that
became ERTBV, estimation of the nucleotide substitution
rate of the genes common to RTBV and ERTBV would
allow us to compare the evolutionary rates of a plant
genome and a plant virus. By such a comparison, we estimated the virus evolution ranged from 30 to140 times
faster than that of the host genome. The faster evolution
of a virus was thus substantiated for the first time in plants
if the virus for ERTBV was in fact the progenitor of RTBV.
The different evolutionary rates are dependent on the
virus genes; that is, the slow evolution might reflect the
functional conservation of the gene.

Figure 6 state of ERTBV in the genomic DNAs from the Oryza AA-genome species
Methylation
Methylation state of ERTBV in the genomic DNAs from the Oryza AA-genome species. Each genomic DNA was digested with
MspI (M) or HpaII (H) as described in Materials and Methods. Differential hybridization patterns between the MspI and HpaII
digests observed in O. sativa and O. rufipogon show heavier methylation compared to the others, and O. longistaminata indicates
possession of methylated ERTBV segments in the genome.

In the other case, in which RTBV and the virus for ERTBV
are phylogenetically located on different branches, the
progeny of the virus corresponding to ERTBV might have
vanished or may be hidden in a small population. Even
though RTBV is not in the case a direct progeny of the

virus corresponding to ERTBV, their structural similarity
and parallel distribution lead us to consider their common ancestral origin.

Figure 7
Two hypothetical processes for the integration of the putative virus for ERTBV into the rice genome
Two hypothetical processes for the integration of the putative virus for ERTBV into the rice genome. DNA strands after the
reverse transcription step of the virus were targeted to AT-repeat sequences (left), or AT-repeat sequences became attached
to the virus segments during the process of the reverse transcription and the complex was integrated into the rice genome
(right).

Correlation between rice tungro disease and ERTBV
Plant virus-like sequences have been found in several
plant genomes such as banana, tobacco and petunia
[11,31]. So far, no association between virus disease and
endogenous virus sequences has been reported [32].
Kobayashi and Ikeda [16] reported that O. glaberrima and
O. barthii showed severe systemic necrosis within 4 weeks
after infection of RTBV and rice tungro spherical virus
(RTSV). O. longistaminata, which possesses ERTBV fragments in its genome, showed disease symptoms like those
of the Asian species, and some of the accessions were utilized for obtaining the resistance gene [29]. Interestingly,
this species originated from Africa where RTBV is not distributed. The fact led us to suppose that there is a correlation between presence or absence of ERTBV in the genome
and the degree of RTBV susceptibility. The species, which
have a low-copy-number of ERTBV tend to be vulnerable
to the rice tungro disease caused by both RTBV and RTSV.
The methylation of ERTBV appeared to be positively
related in the copy number in the genome. Based on a

study on the endogenous virus sequences (EPRV) in
tobacco, Mette et al. [33] proposed a model in which
methylation dependent on the copy number of endogenous virus sequences may induce episomal viral methylation through a homology-dependent process involving
DNA-DNA or RNA-DNA interaction. The phenomenon
observed here fits their model. The copy number of EPRV
in the tobacco genome is 10 times as high as that of
ERTBV in the rice genome. Our results demonstrated that
about 50 copies of endogenous elements are sufficient to
induce methylation in the genome. If we ever find the rice
germ lines that have incorporated sequences more similar
to those of RTBV, as well as ERTBV in germ lines, those
would be exploited as valuable sources of stronger resistance against the rice tungro disease.

Conclusions
The rice genome contains more than 30 of RTBV-like
sequence (ERTBVs) which were unlikely to have
functional potential as a virus, while we were able to

assemble putative virus forms from these sequences. The
phylogenetic analysis showed that at least three times
integrations of authentic ERTBVs occurred during Oryza
speciation. ERTBV integrations likely occurred when the
virus was in the replication process, and were preferentially targeted to AT-repeat sequences. The closely relationship between ERTBV and RTBV were proven by
comparisons of the DNA and amino acid sequences. The
Oryza AA-genome species originated from RTBV-distributed regions appeared to contain higher copy numbers of
ERTBV segments. The methylation state of the ERTBV
sequences was correlated with their copy number in the
genome. The results obtained allowed us to speculate a
possible relationship between RTBV disease resistance
and the copy number and/or DNA methylation of ERTBV
in the Oryza AA-genome species.

clones carrying an ERTBV-containing segment of more
than 4 kb were selected. Nucleotide analysis was performed with using a d-Rhodamine Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Ready Reaction-Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI377 Automated DNA Sequencer
(Applied Biosystems).

ERTBV sequences from Japonica
Sequences of ERTBV in Japonica (cv. Nipponbare) were
mined with rice blast search queries [34] against the rice
genome sequences that had been registered as of June
2003. Twenty-nine ERTBV sequences were found in the
following Japonica genomic database (Table 1).

Construction of phylogenetic trees
The nucleotide sequences and amino acids sequences
inferred from the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene were
aligned using the CLUSTAL W program [35] from the
DNA Data Bank Japan (DDBJ). We calculated the pairwise
nucleotide divergence (K) between 30 independent
ERTBV sequences (including RTBV) based on Kimura's
two-parameter method [36] without taking synonymous
and nonsynonymous changes into account. We constructed a neighbor-joining (NJ) tree based on these estimates [37]. The tree was drawn using PAUP*4.0 [38]. The
consensus maximum parsimony and NJ trees based on
amino acid sequences for RT in 14 viruses including
ERTBV-A, -B and -C were calculated using programs from
the PHYLIP package [20]. The minimum evolution tree
was calculated by the implementation of PAUP software
in the GCG package.

ERTBV sequences from Indica
We attempted to search for ERTBV sequences in the Indica
(cv. 93–11) genome database, however, the homologous
sequences found through the search had insufficient
length for designation as ERTBV segments. Indica ERTBV
sequences were isolated from the EMBL 3 genomic library
constructed with IR36 strain (FL1041j), which was
purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, California). For
screening, a 3.5-kb ERTBV fragment about 50-kb
upstream of the waxy locus was used as probe [17]. Three

Southern hybridization
Total genomic DNA was isolated from 7 Oryza AAgenome species including 14 strains (Table 2). EcoRIdigested DNA was separated by 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis. The resultant DNA was transferred to nylon
membranes (Pall: Biodyne B), and hybridized using the
Alk Phos Direct Southern hybridization kit (Amersham
Life Science). For the probe, nearly the full length of the
7.4-kb ERTBV fragment (located on chromosome 10, BAC
clone accession no. AC069300) was amplified by PCR

were washed twice under the standard Alk Phos conditions with 0.5 M NaCl at 42°C for 20 minutes. To test the
methylation state of ERTBV, Southern blotting analysis
was carried out using the C-methylation-sensitive enzyme
HpaII and the partially sensitive enzyme MspI (isoschizomer of HpaII). The same probe mentioned above was
prepared using a PCR-based labeling system with the PCR
DIG labeling mix (Roche). To verify that complete digestion was achieved by the enzymes, a chloroplast DNA
fragment, the 5.2-kb Sma-8 fragment of buckwheat [22],
was used as a control probe.

The sequences containing Indica ERTBV have been deposited in DDBJ: accession nos. AB124591, AB124592 and
AB124593. The reconstructed sequences for the authentic
ERTBV viruses, ERTBV-A, -B and -C were deposited in
DDBJ: accession nos. BR000029, BR000030 and
BR000031, respectively.
