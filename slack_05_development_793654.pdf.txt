Abstract
Background: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the genus, Leptospira. Leptospira
interrogans is the most common genomospecies implicated in the disease. Epidemiological
investigations are needed to distinguish outbreak situations or to trace reservoirs of the organisms.
Current methodologies used for typing Leptospira have significant drawbacks. The development of
an easy to perform yet high resolution method is needed for this organism.
Methods: In this study we have searched the available genomic sequence of L. interrogans serovar
Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 for the presence of tandem repeats [1]. These repeats were
evaluated against reference strains for diversity. Six loci were selected to create a Multiple Locus
Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (VNTR) Analysis (MLVA) to explore the genetic diversity
within L. interrogans serovar Australis clinical isolates from Far North Queensland.
Results: The 39 reference strains used for the development of the method displayed 39 distinct
patterns. Diversity Indexes for the loci varied between 0.80 and 0.93 and the number of repeat
units at each locus varied between less than one to 52 repeats. When the MLVA was applied to
serovar Australis isolates three large clusters were distinguishable, each comprising various hosts
including Rattus species, human and canines.
Conclusion: The MLVA described in this report, was easy to perform, analyse and was
reproducible. The loci selected had high diversity allowing discrimination between serovars and
also between strains within a serovar. This method provides a starting point on which
improvements to the method and comparisons to other techniques can be made.

Background
Leptospirosis, is the zoonotic disease caused by the spirochete Leptospira. Leptospirosis is characterised either as a

febrile illness with sudden onset, or a 'flu like' illness.
Patients present with chills, headaches, myalgia, and
abdominal pain. In addition, patients may present with

renal and pulmonary complications. It is considered an
emerging infectious disease with large documented outbreaks occurring world-wide [2]. The majority of isolates
detected in Queensland, Australia belong to the genomospecies, L. interrogans, with the dominant serovars being
Zanoni or Australis. Typically Leptospirosis infections in
Queensland are a result of occupational exposure with the
majority of cases occurring in farming or animal based
industries [3].

are repeated DNA sequences of varying copy number.
They are caused by slipped strand mispairing during DNA
replication [24,25]. VNTRs can provide information relating to both the evolutionary and functional areas of bacterial diversity[25]. The ability to detect VNTRs in microorganisms has been greatly enhanced by the availability of
whole genomic sequences and software that can search for
VNTR loci from these sequences. 1, [26,27] Once these
polymorphisms are located, flanking primers can then be
designed to amplify these variable length regions thus
allowing differentiation of copy numbers using the size of
the resultant amplicon. This can be done using standard
agarose gel electrophoresis and if a higher resolution is
required, fluorescent labelling and fragment sizing via a
DNA sequencer can be used. VNTR is therefore applicable
to a wide range of laboratories, including those which
may have simple equipment such as thermal cyclers and
agarose gel electrophoresis but do not have access to
sophisticated equipment such as DNA sequencers. Furthermore when VNTR is applied to multiple loci as a typing scheme such as in Multiple Locus VNTR Analysis
(MLVA) greater discriminatory power and more accurate
determination of genetic relatedness is achieved
[17,19,28,29]. Recently Majed et al [30]described a MLVA
typing scheme for L. interrogans Sensu Stricto, this research
highlighted the value of using VNTR as a typing scheme
but was limited to the identification of serovar by comparing the size of the repeat to that of known reference
strains. It should be noted that in that study several reference strains had identical VNTR patterns including serovars Australis and Bratislava, serovars Copenhageni and
Icterohaemorragiae and serovars Romanica and Wolffi. It
was subsequently validated against a small number of
clinical isolates. In this paper, we report on the development of a MLVA scheme using novel VNTR loci selected
from the sequence of a published L. interrogans genome
[1] and evaluate its usefulness as a phylogenetic typing
method using reference strains and clinical isolates from
Far North Queensland, Australia.

The genus Leptospira contains 17 genomospecies as
shown by DNA-DNA hybridisation [4]. Under the current
genotypic classification system, pathogenic and non pathogenic serovars may reside within the same genomospecies [2]. Many animals both domesticated and native
serve as the reservoir for this bacterium. Leptospires are
shed into the environment via the urine of these animals,
where they survive in the soil or freshwater. Human infections result from contact with the contaminated soil/
water or from direct contact with animals or their infectious body fluids [5].
Epidemiological investigation of this organism is important for the ability to distinguish individual cases from
related cases such as in an outbreak situation. Also of
importance is determining which animal is the likely
common source of the infection, as containing or preventing the spread of the vector is paramount to controlling
the disease.
Molecular typing methods have been described for L.
interrogans including Randomly Amplified Polymorphic
DNA (RAPD) [6-9], Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis
(PFGE) [10], Arbitrarily Primed PCR (AP-PCR) [11,12]
and most recently Fluorescent Amplified Fragment Length
Polymorphism (FAFLP) [13]. Each of these methods have
their disadvantages such as insufficient discriminatory
power, poor inter-lab and intra-lab reproducibility, difficulties with database and dissemination of data [14]. They
may also require specialised equipment such as DNA
sequencers or contour-clamped homogeneous electric
field electrophoresis systems. In addition leptospires have
their own particular problems when using the above
methods, the fastidious nature of the organism does not
easily allow for the large volume of culture material
required for PFGE and cultures can be quite prone to contamination with other bacteria, which may influence the
accuracy of low stringency PCR methods or AFLP. As an
alternative to the above methods, investigation of Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (VNTR) has been
described for various organisms. These include Salmonella
enterica [14,15], Staphylococcus aureus [16], Yersinia pestis
[17], Mycobacterium tuberculosis [18], Francisella tularensis
[19], Legionella pneumophila [20], Brucella spp. [6,21],
Escherichia coli O157:H7 [22]and Borrelia spp[23]. VNTR

Methods
Bacterial Strains
Thirty-nine reference strains of L. interrogans were
obtained from the reference culture collection maintained
by the WHO/FAO/OIE Collaborating Centre for Reference & Research on Leptospirosis, Brisbane, Australia
(Table 1). In addition to the reference strains, ninety-eight
isolates of L. interrogans serovar Australis were analysed
[1]. These isolates were recovered from human and animal specimens. Human isolates were cultured using 0.2–
0.5 mL of whole blood inoculated into 3 mL of semi solid
Ellinghausen McCollugh Johnson Harris broth supplemented with 0.15% agar (EMJH, Difco lab, USA). These
were then sub-cultured into EMJH broth within one week
of receipt at the laboratory. Cultures were incubated for a

further six weeks at 30°C and inspected weekly using dark
ground microscopy. Positive cultures were identified
using hyperimmune antisera and the Cross Agglutination
Absorption Test (CAAT). 3 mm cubes of kidney or 100 µL
of urine from rodents were inoculated into 3 mL semi
solid EMJH media, these were incubated at 30°C for six
weeks and inspected weekly using dark field microscopy.
Positive cultures were identified as above. Once identified, isolates were stored in liquid nitrogen using EMJH
media containing 2.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
DNA Extractions
Once the cultures had reached a density equivalent to a
0.5 McFarland standard (1.5 × 108 cells/mL), cells were

harvested by aspirating 500 µL of culture, centrifuged at
12,000 g for 4 minutes and resuspended in 200 µL of
Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). DNA was extracted
using the Roche High Pure Template kit as per manufacturer's instruction.
VNTR primer design
The two chromosomes of L. interrogans Copenhageni
strain Fiocruz L1-130 deposited in GenBank under accession numbers, NC005823 and NC005824 were used to
detect the VNTR Loci. Analysis using the Tandem Repeat
Finder (TRF) program http://tandem.bu.edu/[1,26] was
used to identify potential VNTR loci. Primer Premier 5.0
(Premier Biosoft) was used to design PCR primers for

amplifying the loci. Primers were designed within the
flanking regions, with a theoretical melting temperature
of 57°C to 60°C (Table 2).
VNTR PCR amplification
PCR amplification of the VNTR loci was performed in a
total volume of 50 µL containing 1X PCR Buffer II
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.), 2 mM MgCl2,
200 µM dNTP mix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J), 10 pmol each of forward and reverse primer
(Table 2), 1 unit of Amplitaq Gold (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, Calif.), 2 µL of the DNA preparation and double distilled water (ddH2O) making up the volume to 50
µL. The PCRs were run on a GeneAmp 9700 thermal cycler
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.). An initial denaturation at 95°C for 9 minutes, was followed by 35 cycles
of a three step cycle protocol: 94°C for 30 seconds, 58°C
for 60 seconds and 72°C for 60 seconds and a final extension of 72°C for 7 minutes. Each PCR product (15 µL)
was resolved by electrophoresis (2 hours at 80 V) through
a 2% agarose gel containing 0.5 ug ethidium bromide and
buffered with 1X TBE (90 mM Tris-borate, 1 mM EDTA,
pH 8). Allelic sizes were estimated using a 100 bp DNA
plus Ladder (MBI Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) as a size
marker. Gels were visualised using UV transillumination
and the images captured using the ChemiDoc XRS System
(BioRad, Hercules, Calif.) (Figure 2).
Sequencing
The PCR products from eight selected references strains
were sequenced using the same primers used to amplify
the products. PCR product clean-up was performed using
an enzyme digestion containing 1 µl of 10X Antarctic
Phosphatase buffer (New England Biolabs, Beverly,
Mass), 2 units of Exonuclease I (MBI Fermentas, Vilnius,
Lithuania), 2 units of Antarctic Phosphatase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass), 7 µL of PCR product and

ddH2O to the final volume of 10 µL. This mix was incubated for 20 min at 37°C follow by 5 min at 80°C to inactivate the enzymes. Sequencing was performed using 1 µL
of Big Dye Terminator V3.1 ready reaction mix (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) with 7 µL of 2.5x Applied
Biosystem sequencing dilution buffer, 3.2 pmol of primer,
3 µL of PCR product and ddH2O to the final volume of 20
µL. The thermal cycling was perform according to the
manufacturer's instructions with the exception of increasing the cycles to 45. The sequencing products were
cleaned up using sodium acetate-ethanol precipitation
before being run on an ABI-373 sequencer. The sequences
were aligned and analysed using Vector NTI Suite 9 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.).
Data Analysis
Using the Quantity One 1D Analysis software package
(BioRad, Hercules, Calif.), the agarose gel images were
analysed and allelic sizes estimated. Allelic sizes were then
converted into repeat copy numbers using Microsoft Excel
software package [1], using the formula: Number of
Repeats (bp) = [Fragment size (bp) – Flanking regions
(bp)] / Repeat size (bp). The repeat copy numbers were
then rounded down to form whole numbers. When repeat
numbers were less than one, they were rounded down to
zero, whilst no amplification was represented by the
number ninety-nine. This created a numerical profile
which was analysed as a character dataset using Bionumerics software package version 3.5 (Applied-Maths, SintMartens-Latern, Belgium). Clustering analysis was done
using the categorical parameter and the Ward coefficient.
Nei's Diversity Index of the VNTR loci was calculated from
the range of alleles generated from the reference strains
utilising the formula; D = 1-Σ(allele frequency)2 [31].

Results
Identification of VNTR markers
The Tandem Repeat Finder program identified 189 repeat
motifs within the genome of L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130. 186 of the repeats were
identified from chromosome 1 and only three were found
in chromosome 2. 53 repeats were identified as being suitable for further analysis based upon the size of the repeat,
number of repeat units present and also whether the
sequence was conserved within the repeats. Preliminary
testing against the reference strains identified 25 loci out
of the 53 that were polymorphic between different serovars. The remaining 25 loci either failed to amplify any
DNA or were amplified but were monomorphic. A subset
of the L. interrogans serovar Australis clinical isolates that
were considered geographically unrelated was used to
determine whether the 25 selected loci were also polymorphic within a serovar. Six loci were found to contain
variable repeat copy numbers within a serovar and were
then re-applied to the 39 reference strains. Amplification
of the six loci was possible from the 39 reference strains
tested with the exceptions of locus V8 from serovar Djasiman, locus V27 from serovar Swaijak and Robinsoni,
locus V29 from serovars Swaijak, Canicola, Broomi, Robinsoni and Jonsis. Amplification was also not possible for
locus V36 from serovars Munchen and Fugis also for
Locus V50 in serovars Lora and Geyaweera. PCR amplification was attempted three times for these serovars, no

amplicons were detected at each attempt. The different
allele sizes were caused by the loss or addition of repeat
units confirmed by the sequencing of the PCR products.
Sequence data was entered into GenBank [GenBank:
DQ023538 – DQ023553].
For the 39 reference strains the number of repeats in the
six loci varied between no repeats in all loci up to 52
repeats in the V36 locus. The number of alleles per locus
varied between six in V27 and nineteen in V36. The diversity index ranged from the lowest of 0.80 in V27 to 0.93
in V36. (Table 3)
L. interrogans reference strains clustering analysis
Clustering analysis (Figure 1) positioned the reference
strains into three large clusters. These clusters each contained a diverse selection of serovars with no bias towards
the grouping of serogroups together, with the exception of
serovar Iceterohaemorrhagie strain Ictero 1, Copenhageni
strain M20, serovar Hardjo strain Hardjoprajitno and
Haemolytica strain Marsh. Both of these pairs of serovars
belong to the same serogroups: Icterohaemorrhagie and
Sejroe respectively.
L. interrogans serovar Australis clustering analysis
To further evaluate the VNTR loci selected for the MLVA,
the typing scheme was applied to 98 isolates of L. interrogans serovar Australis. All six VNTR loci were amplified

from all of these clinical isolates, which varied in geography of isolation and host. Clustering analysis [2 and 3]
revealed three major clusters, each containing several subgroups. Three clusters contained a mix of Rattus species
and human whilst two contained canine isolates. Two of
the major clusters show significant geographical distributions towards the two main townships in the area: Tully
and Innisfail, whilst the remaining major cluster was
more diverse in geographical distributions. As the isolates
were taken over a limited timeframe, not surprisingly
there was no discernable pattern in regards to the introduction or extinction of strains over time in the area.

downstream from the repeat regions or the lack of the
VNTR loci all together. Further investigations using isolates of these serovars is needed to determine whether
there is sufficient diversity in the remaining loci for it to
be valid as a typing method. In the study by Majed et al.
[30], they noted from the dendrogram that the isolates
had clustered into distinct global geographical regions.
Interestingly in this study, we found that the dendrogram
showed no bias towards this global geographical clustering of reference strains.

Discussion
The MLVA assay presented was easy to perform and analyse, as it consisted of six individual PCR reactions and
agarose gel electrophoresis. Selected reference strain isolates were run in tandem during the initial evaluation by
different individuals to assess reproducibility, each time
they displayed identical fragment sizes as determined by
sequencing and agarose gel electrophoresis (data not
shown). Dilutions of the template DNA were used to evaluate whether the fragment sizes were template concentration dependant. Dilutions of 1:10 and 1:100 did not effect
fragment size but did result in reduced PCR product yield
(data not shown). The MLVA assay was proven to be
reproducible under varying laboratory conditions. The
two limitations of this assay are firstly the use of agarose
gel electrophoresis to separate fragments for allelic sizing,
due to inherent inaccuracies of this method to size bands
of close molecular weights given that the resolution is
dependant on agarose composition and concentration
and secondly in rounding partial repeat copy numbers to
the nearest whole number to make the data analysis easier, isolates that had partial repeats were treated as if they
contained whole repeats. As illustrated in Additional file
1, by simplifying the repeat copy numbers we have
artificially reduced the resolution of the method and its
ability to distinguish between closely related strains that
may only vary by a partial repeat at one or more of the
loci.
The diversity index calculated for each locus suggests that
the loci selected are of highly polymorphic nature and
therefore have greater discriminatory power between similar strains than loci with a lower diversity indexes would
have. Whilst it has been previously reported in organisms
such as Francisella tularensis [19] and Yersinia pestis [29]
that higher copy repeat numbers may confer higher allelic
variability, it was not demonstrated with this study. This
may be due to the loci having similar repeat copy sizes
(36–47 bp) with the exception of locus V27 with a repeat
size of 138 bp. The lack of amplification from loci V8,
V27, V29, V36 and V50 from certain reference strains may
be due to sequence diversity in the flanking regions up or

The different genomospecies of Leptospira were not used in
the selection and development of the VNTR loci for this
typing scheme. The basis for this decision was that the
other genomospecies are considered to be significantly
different from L. interrogans based upon DNA-DNA
Hybridisation [32,33] and may not possess the same
primer binding sites or indeed the same VNTR loci. In
addition due to the use of a serologically based Leptospiral taxonomy system, several serovars belong to more
than one genomospecies [32,33], thus it would be doubtful that the MLVA typing scheme described in this article
would be useful in determining the genomospecies of
these related serovars due to the significant genetic
differences[34]
When the MLVA assay was applied to L. interrogans serovar
Australis isolates collected from 1995 to 2004, the six
selected loci appeared to show less diversity. This could be
due to the fact that the isolates were taken from within a
limited geographical area of Far North Queensland.
Despite this apparent limited diversity, the phylogenetic
analysis revealed several large albeit weakly linked clusters. All of these clusters contained a mixture of hosts, and
it would be possible to speculate that the transmission of
serovar Australis to humans in that area is via the native
rodent population indigenous to that area. Another possible risk whilst not proven in Australia, is that transmission
of the organism may occur via canines to humans [2].
Indeed in this study the two strains isolated from canines
are genetically similar to two strains isolated from
humans. Also of interest, the reference culture for serovar
Australis; strain Ballico which was isolated from a patient
in North Queensland in 1934, shows homology with
LT958 and QHR371A a human and Rattus sordidus isolate
respectively, both from the Tully region. Further investigations using MLVA of isolates, could add further detail to
the depth of knowledge into the population of serovar
Australis and to determine other possible transmission
sources to humans.
Further improvements to this method are possible to
increase both practicality and discriminatory power for
typing of L. interrogans isolates. These improvements
could include the use of fluorescently labelled primers

and fragment analysis using a DNA sequencer to accurately assign repeat sizes. Multiplexing of the six targets
would rationalise the number of PCR reactions needed to
complete the MLVA and would also decrease costs in
terms of reagents and labour. Improvements that could be
introduced to the analysis of the data may include using
an allele designation system as described by Lindstedt et
al [34]. In addition to improving the method, comparisons between other molecular typing methods such as
FAFLP or a sequence based typing scheme, would ultimately determine the validity of the MLVA assay as molecular epidemiology tool for L. interrogans.

Competing interests

The method has potential application in furthering the
understanding of Leptospiral molecular epidemiology. As
this method can be performed without specialised equipment, a broader range of laboratories including those in
developing countries could potentially use this scheme as
part of their isolate typing. This method was also easily
standardised within our laboratory, with multiple users
and different thermal cyclers employed to achieve the
same results. This level of standisation at an inter laboratory level would allow the transfer of the method into
another laboratory more effectively than that of a method
that was operator or equipment specific. The simplification of MLVA data into a concise and portable numerical
format as suggested in this article makes it easier to be
comprehended by non-technical staff such as public
health authorities. In addition, the format of allele data is
similar to the allele string that is used for Multiple Locus
Sequence Typing (MLST). As an alternative to using Bionumerics, software freely available on the internet such as
Sequence Type Analysis and Recombinational Tests
(START) http://pubmlst.org/software/analysis/[35] could
be used for the phylogenetic analysis. Bionumerics was
ultimately selected over START due to the advanced
features of Bionumerics including evolutionary and population modelling.

Additional material

Further assessment of L. interrogans isolates globally is
required to confirm that the selected VNTR loci possess
sufficient diversity to be used a typing scheme on an international level.

Conclusion
We have developed a novel MLVA typing scheme which is
simple, robust reproducible and cost effective. The six
VNTR loci chosen for this assay showed a high level of
diversity between reference strains. When this method
was applied to a collection of clinical isolates, it was possible to observe distant relationships between suspected
reservoirs and humans. This method provides a starting
point for further investigations into the molecular epidemiology of L. interrogans infections.
