Abstract
Background: Cystatins and their putative targets, the families of cysteine proteinases C1A and
C13 play key roles in plants. Comparative genomic analyses are powerful tools to obtain valuable
insights into the conservation and evolution of the proteinases and their proteinaceous inhibitors,
and could aid to elucidate issues concerning the function of these proteins.
Results: We have performed an evolutionary comparative analysis of cysteine proteinases C1A
and C13 and their putative inhibitors in representative species of different taxonomic groups that
appeared during the evolution of the Viridiplantae. The results indicate that whereas C1A cysteine
proteinases are present in all taxonomic groups, cystatins and C13 cysteine proteinases are absent
in some basal groups. Moreover, gene duplication events have been associated to the increasing
structural and functional complexities acquired in land plants.
Conclusion: Comparative genomic analyses have provided us valuable insights into the
conservation and evolution of the cystatin inhibitory family and their putative targets, the cysteine
proteinases from families C1A and C13. Functionality of both families of proteins in plants must be
the result of a coevolutionary process that might have occurred during the evolution of basal and
land plants leading to a complex functional relationship among them.

Background
Proteinaceous peptidase inhibitors are proteins that have
the potential to attenuate the activities of peptidases by
the formation of complexes with the enzymes. In the
MEROPS database (release 8.00), 56 different families of
peptidase inhibitors are included [1,2]. One of them corresponds to a family of peptidase inhibitors called cystatins, which constitute a superfamily of evolutionary related
proteins able to inhibit cysteine proteinases from the
papain subfamily C1A. Those from plants are called phytocystatins (PhyCys) and form an independent subfamily
that cluster on a distinct branch from other cystatin fami-

lies on the phylogenetic tree [3]. The cystatin inhibitory
mechanism involves a wedge formed by the partially flexible N-terminus containing a glycine residue and two hairpin loops carrying a highly conserved motif QXVXG and a
tryptophan residue, respectively [4,5]. Most PhyCys have
a molecular mass in the 12–16 kDa range and are devoid
both, of disulphide bonds and of putative glycosilation
sites. However, several PhyCys with a molecular mass of ≈
23 kDa have a carboxy-terminal extension, which has
been involved in the inhibition of a second family of
cysteine peptidases, the legumain peptidases C13 [6].
PhyCys have a dual role. In the plant, they have been

related to the regulation of activity of endogenous
cysteine proteinases during seed development and germination [7-10], and of programmed cell death [11,12]. Furthermore, a defense role has been inferred to PhyCys from
their ability to inhibit exogenous proteinases such as
those present in the digestive tracts of insects [13-15], the
enhanced resistance against pests observed in transgenic
plants overexpressing PhyCys genes [15-18], and the antifungal activities described for certain PhyCys [19-23].
The main target of PhyCys, the papain-like subfamily C1A
is the most thoroughly studied among plant cysteine proteinases. Papain contains three disulfide bonds and its
chain is folded to form a globular protein with two interacting domains delimiting a cleft at the surface where substrates can be bound [24]. The evolutionary highly
conserved catalytic mechanism of these peptidases
involves the three amino acids Cys 25, His 159 and Asn
175 (according to the papain numbering). These enzymes
are synthesized as inactive precursors, which comprise an
N-terminal signal peptide, a 38–250 residues prosequence, and the mature protein generally 220–260 amino
acids long. Activation takes place by limited intra- or intermolecular proteolysis cleaving off an inhibitory propeptide [25]. In plants, papain-like peptidases are involved in
various physiological processes, such as the post-translational processing of storage proteins into mature forms
and the liberation of amino acids to be used during germination [26-29]. An important role in the intracellular
catabolism for senescence and programmed cell death has
been also attributed to papain-like enzymes [11,30,31].
Moreover, a role in stress tolerance and defence against
pathogens has been postulated [32-34].
The second target to cystatins is the legumain-like family
C13 of cysteine proteinases. Their tertiary structure has
not been reported yet, but similarities in sequence and
predicted secondary structure around their active site residues Histidine and Cysteine lead Chen et al. [35] to suggest that their fold is similar to that of the caspases in
family C14. Legumain is synthesized as a precursor with
both N- and C-terminal propeptides. Prolegumain is
directed to the plant vacuole, where activation occurs at
least partially by autolysis [36]. In plants, legumains or
VPE (vacuolar processing enzymes) catalyze an Asn- and
Asp-specific limited proteolysis. There is abundant evidence indicating that legumains perform a proteinprocessing function that causes a limited proteolysis of
precursor proteins [37]. Legumain from plant seeds is
thought to be responsible for the post-translational
processing of seed proteins prior to storage [38]. During
germination, legumains contribute to the activation of
cysteine proteinases to degrade storage proteins [39,40]. A
role in defense against pathogens executing programmed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/198

cell death due to the caspase activity observed for several
legumains has also been proposed [41,42].
Although peptidase-inhibitor interactions are crucial to
many important processes in plant cells, very little information is available on the origin and evolution of these
protein families in plants. To date, a comprehensive analysis of cystatin families has been only done in the completed genomes of the mono and dicotyledoneous model
plants Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana [43]. Likewise,
the family of papain-like cysteine proteinases from Arabidopsis was formerly described by Beers et al. [44], and different families of putative cysteine proteinases in the
completely sequenced genomes of Populus trichocarpa and
Arabidopsis have been reviewed by Garcia-Lorenzo et al.
[45].
Comparative genomic analyses could provide valuable
insights into the conservation and evolution of the proteinases and their proteinaceous inhibitors, which could aid
to elucidate issues concerning the function of these proteins. Thus, we have performed a phylogenetic analysis of
these gene families in representative species of different
taxonomic groups. The results indicate that whereas
papain-like cysteine proteinases are present in all taxonomic groups, cystatins and legumain-like proteins are
absent in some basal groups. Moreover, gene duplication
events have been associated to the increasing structural
and functional complexities acquired in land plants.

Results
A survey of cystatins and cysteine proteinases (C1A and
C13) in plants
In a first step to know the origin and evolution of cystatins
and papain and legumain-like cysteine proteinases in
plants, an extensive search of the TIGR plant transcript
assemblies (TA) database was made. All plant species for
which more than 1,000 ESTs or cDNA sequences are available are included in the database. Thus, TAs from 252
plant species from unicellular organisms to flowering
plants could be explored. In addition, the Tree of Life Web
Project provides information on the evolutionary phylogenetic relationships in the green plants. Based on this
information, we constructed a tree with the main clades of
modern plants (Fig. 1). In this tree, the presence of any
species of each clade with a TA belonging to the cystatin
family, or to the papain-like or legumain-like cysteine
proteinase families is represented. The clades of the
Embryophytes or land plants present cystatins and both
types of cysteine proteinases, with the exception of Cycads
and Gingkos, in which no legumain-like cysteine proteinases have been detected yet. In contrast, the algae have a
great variability of detected proteinases and inhibitors.
Thus, whereas cystatins have not been detected in Prasinophytes, Ulvophyceae and Zignematales, the algae groups

of colour indicates clades without representative species in the TIGR plant transcript assemblies database.
Chlorophyceae and Trebouxiophyceae possess both proteinases and inhibitors. This approximation permitted us
a survey of how these protein families could have evolved.
However, the actual number of papain and legumain-like
proteinases and cystatins encoded in a plant genome can
only be known using the whole genome sequence.
Number of cystatins and cysteine proteinases (C1A and
C13) in completely sequenced plants
To date, four algae (two Prasinophytes, Ostreococcus tauri
and Ostreococcus lucimarinus; and two Chlorophyceae,
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Volvox carteri), one moss
(Physcomitrella patens), one spikemoss (Selaginella mollendorffii), and three angiosperms (Arabidopsis thaliana, Populus trichocarpa and Oryza sativa) have been completely
sequenced and drafts of these sequences are available on
the web. These eight species and the monocot species Hordeum vulgare, with an extremely large number of EST and
cDNA sequences available, were selected to establish the
number of proteinases and inhibitors. Thus, extensive
searches for C1A, C13 proteinases, and cystatins were

made (Table 1). Among the algae, no cystatins were found
in the two Ostreococcus species, whereas the Chlorophyceae species possess a unique cystatin that lacks the 3'
extension related to the inhibitory properties against legumain-like proteinases. However, all these species present
papain-like proteinases and the Chlorophyceae species a
unique legumain proteinase. From the moss to the
angiosperms, the number of cystatins gradually increased.
In the moss and the spikemoss, the presence of cystatins
with the 3' extension is correlated with an increase in the
number of legumain-like proteins. In angiosperms, a
higher number of cystatins than in the non-seed land
plants is accompanied by a sharp increase in the number
of papain-like cysteine proteinases.
Evolution of C1A cysteine-proteinases in plants
To know how papain-like cysteine proteinases could have
evolved from algae to angiosperms, the C1A mature protein fragments from 25 amino acids before the putative
location of the cysteine reactive residue until 18 amino
acids after the asparagine reactive residue were selected.

These amino acid sequences were aligned by MUSCLE
(see Additional file 1, partial sequences corresponding to
HvPap-23 and HvPap26 were not included), and a phylogenetic tree was constructed by the maximum likelihood
PhyML method (see Additional file 2). A schematic representation of the obtained cladogram is shown in Figure 2.
C1A proteinases were originally described as cathepsins in
mammals, and plant cysteine proteinases have been traditionally classified based on their homology to them [44].
When the obtained C1A proteins were classified in this
form, ten main groups comprising C1A proteinases
homologous to the human B, F, H, and L-cathepsins were
found. B-like proteins shared a similar sequence to
human B-cathepsin. F-like proteinases conserved an ERFNAQ motif typical to this kind of cathepsins in their
proregion. H and L-like proteins conserved the ERFNIN
motif present in mammal H and L cathepsins in the proregion. Several algal papain-like proteinases (groups Algae A
to D) and the barley protein HvPap-32 did not present
enough similarities to mammalian cathepsins to be considered as their plant homologous proteins and were
grouped separately. To deal with the extremely complex
group of H and L-like cathepsins, an analysis to discover
homologous motifs was made using the MEME software
(data not shown). All the proteins shared a high number
of identical motifs, but several ones could be used to discriminate among proteins belonging to different subgroups. From this analysis, five subgroups (A to E) of Llike proteins were defined. Two of them (B and C) correlated with well-defined branches of the phylogenetic tree
and were formed by only angiosperm proteins, as well as
group A which was split in several branches. Group D
includes branches of L-like C1A sequences composed of
algae, moss, spikemoss and angiosperm proteins. Three
branches of the phylogenetic tree formed by cereal
sequences could be assigned to the subgroup E. Some
other branches formed by C1A proteins for all clades
could not be included to any subgroup and were assigned
as other L-like cathepsins (Suppl. Fig. 1). For H-like cathepsins, two subgroups could be detected, one of them
included C1A proteinases from the moss to angiosperms,

and the other was formed by algal proteins. In Table 2, the
number of C1A proteinases belonging to each group is
shown. B-like C1A are present in all analyzed species and
the number did not vary during plant evolution. F-like
proteinases were also maintained from algae, although
they were not detected in the Chlorophyceae, and their
number slightly increased in angiosperms. H-like proteinases were detected in Chlorophyceae, and were maintained from moss to angiosperms. L-like proteins showed
the most striking pattern. They first appeared in algae,
slightly increased in the moss, and they presented a sharp
increase from the spikemoss to the angiosperms. Finally,
C1A proteinases not related to mammalian proteinases
(indicated as other) were mainly found in algae.
Evolution of C13 cysteine-proteinases in plants
Similarly, to know how the second target of cystatins, the
legumain-like cysteine proteinases could have evolved
from algae to angiosperms, the amino acid sequences of
C13 proteinases were aligned by MUSCLE (see Additional
file 1), and a cladogram was constructed by the maximum
likelihood PhyML method (Fig. 3). The C13 proteins from
Chlorophyceae were the most different and did not
grouped with the other legumain sequences. Orthology
relationships could be detected for angiosperm proteins
located in groups supported by approximate likelihoodTable 2: Number of C1A cysteine proteinases grouped by
similarity to mammalian proteinases.

nies were constructed by the maximum likelihood PhyML
method. When the main cystatin body was compared,
omitting the signal peptides and the C-terminal extensions (Fig. 4), the cystatins from Chlorophyceae were the
most different to the other cystatin sequences. The rest of
sequences, with the exception of PtCPI-6, AtCYS5 and
AtCYS4, could be distributed in three groups, one of them
containing the five cystatins from the moss, the two cystatins from the spikemoss and several cystatins from all the
angiosperm species. A second group was formed by mono
or dicotyledoneous sequences, and only barley and rice
sequences were located in the third group. When the Cterminal extensions were compared, the cystatins from
the moss and the spikemoss were grouped separately from
the angiosperm sequences (Fig. 5). The low number of 3'
extended cystatins in completely sequenced genomes led
us to compare the sequences obtained for other plant species from the TIGR Plant Transcript Assemblies (Fig. 6).
The PhyML obtained tree resembles the evolutionary relationships among plant species, from algae to
angiosperms, which denotes the ancestral characteristic of
these C-terminal extensions. Interestingly, when the
cDNA sequences of the cystatins with a C-terminal extension of the two algae species (one Chlorophyceae and one
Trebuxiophyceae) were revised, the two main domains of
the protein, the cystatin and the legumain inhibitory
domain were separated by a stop codon, which was not
present in the rest of carboxy extended proteins from
plants.

Discussion
Nowadays, comparative genomic analysis has become as
a powerful tool to discover evolutionary relationships
between protein families. In this work, we analysed the
evolutionary relationships among cystatins and their
putative target enzymes, the cysteine proteinases C1A and
C13 in different fully sequenced clades that appeared during plant evolution. To date, a comprehensive analysis of
cystatin families had been only done in the completed
genomes of A. thaliana and O. sativa [43]. For C1A
cysteine proteinases, only the protein families in Arabidopsis and P. trichocarpa had been previously described
[44,45]. At present, the complete protein family of C13
proteinases had not been analysed in any plant species.
The present phylogenetic study of phytocystatins indicates
that this subfamily might have evolved from a common
ancestor. This ancestral protein could have been lost in
some algal lineages as in the Prasinophytes, and maintained in some other as the Chlorophyceae. However, the
algal cystatins differ from the rest of the PhyCys in the
presence of two cysteine residues, and the absence of the
consensus motif [LVI]- [AGT]- [RKE]- [FY]- [AS]- [VI]-x[EDQV]- [HYFQ]-N specific to PhyCys [3]. Later on, this
protein family would have expanded in the different tax-

onomic groups of vascular plants by recurrent duplication
events in the course of evolution. Whether the ancestral
cystatin was able to inhibit both C1A and C13 cysteine
proteinases remains unknown. The C. reinhardtii and V.
carteri cystatins did not posses the carboxy terminal extension present in the phytocystatins that inhibit legumainlike cysteine proteinases [6]. However, some animal
cystatins are able to inhibit this kind of proteinases using
the main core of the cystatin domain [46]. Since both
algae possess one legumain-like protein, this second possibility cannot be discarded. Interestingly, two cystatins
expressed by the algae Scenedesmus obliquus and
Heliosporidium sp ex Simulium jonesii, belonging to the
related algae families Chlorophyceae and Trebouxiophyceae did have the carboxy terminal extension with the legumain inhibitory motif. This carboxy terminal extensions
are recognized by the Pfam motif database [47] as a cystatin domain, which suggest that C-extensions of plant
cystatins are degenerated parts of a dimeric cystatin that
probably originated by gene duplication followed by
divergent evolution. Curiously, a stop codon is located

between the two domains of these algal proteins. Since
they are correctly expressed, the whole protein could be
translated by readthrough the stop codon. In eukaryotes,
readthrough is mainly due to decoding of the internal
stop as normal amino acid or a noncanonical one, as seen
for C. reinhardtii [48], suppression by a natural non-sense
suppressor tRNA [49,50], or a stable hairpin loop structure downstream of the stop codon [51].
With the exception of C. reinhardtii and V. carteri, the presence of cystatins with the C-terminal extension and legumain-like proteinases is well correlated. The
Prasinophytes O. tauri and O. lucimarinus are devoid of
both whereas vascular plants posses several members of
these two protein families. Legumain-like cysteine proteinases are a small family in plants since no more than five
members of this subfamily are present in any species.
Likewise, the number of cystatins with the C-terminal
extension is small, ranging from one to three. In higher
plants, legumains have been involved in important physiological processes. They are implicated in the activation
of papain-like cysteine proteinases to degrade storage proteins in the seed [39,40,52], and in defense against pathogens executing programmed cell death [41,42].
However, the restricted activity of these proteinases,
which have not been related to an elevated number of
physiological processes, could account for the small
number of members of this protein family.
The case of the papain-like cysteine proteinases was significantly different. These proteins have been involved in
many physiological processes in vascular plants, including protein processing in the seed, senescence and programmed cell death, pollen development, and defence
against pathogens [11,27,28,31,33,53]. In algae, the large
number of C1A proteinases, ranging from 9 to 14, suggests an important role of these proteins in their life cycle.
However, there is only one report concerning the physiological roles of C1A cysteine proteinases. A protein,
VcPap-11, is induced by the sex-inducing pheromone of
the multicellular green algae V. carteri [54]. Interestingly,
whereas the C1A proteinases from vascular plants are all
related to mammalian cathepsins from the groups B, F, H
and L, a large number of algal C1A members could not be
assigned to these groups, including VcPap-11. This suggests specialized functions in algae for these proteins not
present in vascular plants, such as the response to sexinducing pheromones. In angiosperms, the number of
putative C1A cysteine proteinases dramatically increased
(mainly L-like) which could also mean a specialization of
these proteinases to the new functions required in these
plants. In fact, Arabidopsis AtPap-14 (XCP1) and AtPap15 (XCP2), which belong to the angiosperm subgroup B
of the L-like cathepsins, are expressed in the tracheary elements of the xylem [55]. Similarly, proteins of the L-like

subgroup D formed by C1A sequences from algae to
angiosperms could have evolved to achieve specific functions of higher plants. OsPap-24 and OsPap-18 (Oryzains
a and b) have been involved in seed storage mobilization,
and OsPap-19 (OsCPI1) in pollen development [53,56].
Unfortunately, the function of the majority of these proteinases remains enigmatic, and testing for subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization events following gene
duplication exceeds the scope of this project.

Conclusion
Comparative genomic analyses have provided us valuable
insights into the conservation and evolution of the cystatin inhibitory family and their putative targets, the
cysteine proteinases from families C1A and C13. A phylogenetic analysis of these gene families in representative
species of different plant taxonomic groups has permitted
us to state that whereas papain-like cysteine proteinases
are present in all groups, cystatins and legumain-like proteins are absent in some basal groups. Moreover, in all
these families, gene duplication events are associated with
the increasing structural and functional complexities
acquired in land plants. Thus, the complex functional
relationship between both families of proteins must be
the result of a coevolutionary process that might have
occurred during the evolution of basal and land plants.

Methods
Genome databases searches
Blast searches for C1A and C13 cysteine proteinases and
for cystatins were performed in publicly available genome
databases. Sequences for Oryza sativa ssp. japonica (rice
annotation release 5) were obtained at The Institute for
Genomic Research (TIGR) [57]. Sequences for Arabidopsis
thaliana were identified by searching The Arabidopsis
Information Resource (TAIR) database (TAIR7 genome
release) [58]. Searches for algae, moss, spikemoss and
poplar sequences were carried out at the DOE Joint
Genome Institute (JGI) [59], using the current releases:
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii v3.0 [60]; Volvox carteri f. nagariensis v1.0 [61]; Ostreococcus lucimarinus v2.0 [62]; Ostreococcus tauri v2.0 [63]; Physcomitrella patens ssp. patens v1.1
[64]; Sellaginella moellendorffii v1.0 [65]; Populus trichocarpa v1.1 [66]. Information about gene models for all
these proteins is compiled in Tables I, III and IV from
Additional file 3.
Screening of barley EST and cDNA libraries
C1A, C13 cysteine proteinases and cystatin sequences
were used to search for ESTs or cDNA sequences in publicly available libraries of barley using the tblastn program
at the DNA Data Bank of Japan [67] and the Okayama
University Barley Database [68]. Selected ESTs were
obtained and sequenced in both strands using vector-specific primers using an automated DNA sequencer (ABI

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/198

PRISM TM 3100; Perkin Elmer-Applied Biosystems).
Accession numbers are in Tables I, III and IV from additional file 3.
Searches for expressed genes in plants
C1A, C13 cysteine proteinases and cystatin sequences
were used to search the TIGR plant transcript assemblies
(TA) database [69]. The sequences that are used to build
the plant TAs are expressed transcripts collected from
dbEST (ESTs) and the NCBI GenBank nucleotide database. Sequences are initially clustered based on an allagainst-all comparisons using Megablast. The initial clusters are assembled to generate consensus sequences using
CAP3. Assembly criteria include a 50 bp minimum match,
95% minimum identity in the overlap region and 20 bp
maximum unmatched overhangs. Any EST/cDNA
sequences that are not assembled into TAs are included as
singletons. TAs from 252 plant species from unicellular
organisms to flowering plants are included in this database. Transcript assembly accessions for cystatin 3'
extended genes are shown in Table II from Additional file
3.
Phylogeny of plants
The phylogenetic tree used to the survey of the evolution
of C1A, C13 cysteine proteinases and cystatins was based
on the Viridiplantae tree of the Tree of Life Web Project
(ToL) [70], which is a collaborative effort of biologists
from around the world to provide information about the
diversity of organisms on Earth, their evolutionary history
(phylogeny), and characteristics.
Protein alignments and Phylogenetic trees
Alignments of the amino acid sequences were performed
using the default parameters of MUSCLE version 3.6 [71].
For cystatins and cysteine proteinases C13 controversial
models were not detected and the whole amino acid
sequences were aligned. For cysteine proteinases C1A, presumed wrong models were detected and protein alignments were restricted to the part of the protein that was
not controversial in any model and conserves the characteristic features of papain-like cysteine proteinases (from
25 amino acids before the putative location of the cysteine
reactive residue until 18 amino acids after the asparagine
reactive residue). Alignments ambiguities and gaps were
excluded from phylogenetic analysis using GBLOCKS version 0.91b [72]. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary
analyses were conducted using the programs PhyML and
MEGA version 4.0 [73-75]. The displayed C1A, C13
cysteine proteinases and cystatin trees were derived using
a maximum likelihood PhyML method using the WAG
substitution model and a BIONJ starting tree. The approximate likelihood-ratio test (aLRT) based on a ShimodairaHasegawa-like procedure was used as statistical test for
non-parametric branch support [76]. Displayed cladog-

rams are condensed trees with cut-off aLRT values of 80%.
All families were also analysed with the Maximum parsimony, Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic
Mean (UPGMA), and the Neighbour-Joining algorithms,
and with different gap penalties. No significant differences in the tree topologies were detected.

Identification of conserved motifs
The deduced protein sequences of the putative H and Llike cathepsins were analysed by means of the MEME program [77,78]. Default parameters were used, except that
the minimal and maximal motif widths were set to 6 and
12 amino acids, respectively, and the maximum number
of motifs to find was defined as 50.
