Abstract
Background: Apoptosis is a critical biological phenomenon, executed under the guidance of the
Apoptotic Machinery (AM), which allows the physiologic elimination of terminally differentiated,
senescent or diseased cells. Because of its relevance to BioMedicine, we have sought to obtain a
detailed characterization of AM Omics in Homo sapiens, namely its Genomics and Evolution,
Transcriptomics, Proteomics, Interactomics, Oncogenomics, and Pharmacogenomics.
Methods: This project exploited the methodology commonly used in Computational Biology (i.e.,
mining of many omics databases of the web) as well as the High Throughput biomolecular analytical
techniques.

Results: In Homo sapiens AM is comprised of 342 protein-encoding genes (possessing either antior pro-apoptotic activity, or a regulatory function) and 110 MIR-encoding genes targeting them:
some have a critical role within the system (core AM nodes), others perform tissue-, pathway-, or
disease-specific functions (peripheral AM nodes). By overlapping the cancer type-specific AM
mutation map in the fourteen most frequent cancers in western societies (breast, colon, kidney,
leukaemia, liver, lung, neuroblastoma, ovary, pancreas, prostate, skin, stomach, thyroid, and uterus)
to their transcriptome, proteome and interactome in the same tumour type, we have identified the
most prominent AM molecular alterations within each class. The comparison of the fourteen
mutated AM networks (both protein- as MIR-based) has allowed us to pinpoint the hubs with a
general and critical role in tumour development and, conversely, in cell physiology: in particular, we
found that some of these had already been used as targets for pharmacological anticancer therapy.
For a better understanding of the relationship between AM molecular alterations and
pharmacological induction of apoptosis in cancer, we examined the expression of AM genes in
K562 and SH-SY5Y after anticancer treatment.
Conclusion: We believe that our data on the Apoptotic Machinery will lead to the identification
of new cancer genes and to the discovery of new biomarkers, which could then be used to profile
cancers for diagnostic purposes and to pinpoint new targets for pharmacological therapy. This
approach could pave the way for future studies and applications in molecular and clinical Medicine
with important perspectives both for Oncology as for Regenerative Medicine.

Background
Cells use sophisticated mechanisms to functionally connect their molecules and machineries with the aim of activating, sustaining and modulating their critical functions:
survival, growth, proliferation, differentiation, and death
[1,2]. Following the characterization of very complex
cross-talks among the different signalling cascades, a
molecular network view of cell biology and physiology
has emerged together with the concept of Biological Complex Systems [3]. The ultimate outcome of this structural
and functional organization is the metabolism of organisms and their cells. Recently, the striking evolution of
experimental HT (High Throughput) strategies (i.e., computational, molecular, cellular, and systemic techniques)
has made it possible for Biology to become holistic, thus
providing also a top > down view of organisms [4]. The
complex biological system par excellence is the human
being. However, because of the technological and conceptual limits that this type of study still presents, it seems
appropriate to focus on more discrete entities such as the
molecular machineries specifically responsible for a phenotypic phenomenon or a biomolecular function (e.g.,
the Transcription Apparatus, TA, or the Apoptotic Machinery, AM) [5,6]. The critical importance of apoptosis for the
BioPathology of Homo sapiens is stressed by the following
considerations. Apoptosis performs a central role during
development and differentiation (e.g., morphogenesis,
immune and nervous system development, and sexual
differentiation), and at steady state during adult life (e.g.,
tissue homeostasis, elimination of damaged or abnormal
cells, and defence against infections) [7,8]: for instance,
each day about one in a million of our cells dies (about
50–100 × 109 out of 50–100 × 1015), mostly via apoptosis,

to be replaced through stem cells proliferation and differentiation [9]. Unsurprisingly, apoptosis is the most common and evolutionarily conserved among the
mechanisms causing cell death [10,11]. Its critical biological functions make it very likely that AM dysfunctions
also would have an important pathogenetic role in many
diseases [12,13]. It is known that an abnormal increase of
apoptosis is involved in degenerative diseases (e.g., Diabetes, Arterioschlerosis), neurodegenerative diseases (e.g.,
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease), autoimmune diseases (e.g., Multiple Sclerosis), ischemic pathologies (e.g.,
myocardial infarction), pathologies caused by toxins (e.g.,
hepatitis induced by alcohol), viral or bacterial infections
(e.g., HIV or Neisseria meningitidis) [14-16]. On the other
hand, inhibition of apoptosis is present in most cancers:
in fact, one of the critical goals of contemporary Oncology
is to understand how cancer cells evade death, both the
one endogenously activated as well as that induced by
host mechanisms of immune surveillance or by therapeutic treatments [17-19]. Accordingly, molecular profiling of
apoptotic pathways within the AM of a specific cancer
should be critical to rationally design strategies toward its
elimination [20,21]. Incidentally, this work may lead to
understanding the molecular bases of cancer immortality
[22,23]. In this paper, we focus on AM Omics in Homo
sapiens (Genomics, Transcriptomics including MIRs, Proteomics including PTMs and NUPs, Interactomics,
Oncogenomics, and Pharmacogenomics) and describe
AM evolution through the analysis of its structure in
ninety organisms from Homo sapiens to Escherichia coli. We
then use these data to characterize AM Omics in the fourteen most frequent cancer types in the Western World,
with the aim of identifying new markers for the design of

innovative antineoplastic strategies. Finally, we experimentally validate our work through HT analysis of AM
transcriptome changes in CML and neuroblastoma, after
in vitro treatment with commonly used therapeutic drugs.

Methods
Dataset of genes involved in apoptosis
Because of the intrinsic nature of biological systems and
processes, the unequivocal identification of a gene's
involvement in a specific process is nontrivial. Since genes
participate in a varied spectrum of biomolecular phenomena with a varying degree of involvement, the experimental work involves inference that admits some false
positives and negatives and hence does not always necessarily yield clear-cut answers. Nonetheless, within a cellular machinery such as AM it is possible to identify: (i)
putative core nodes, ubiquitously expressed genes
endowed with a central biomolecular role in the activation or inhibition of apoptosis (e.g., death receptors,
members of the Bcl2 family, caspases); (ii) putative peripheral nodes, genes with tissue-, pathway-, or disease-specific functions: in many cases these perform a regulatory
role. We first searched the GO database [24] by using as
key words apoptosis and cell death and compiled a preliminary list of human genes associated with apoptosis; this
was then manually filtered by using literature data from
PubMed, in order to experimentally verify the involvement of these genes in apoptosis [25]. The final list of AM
genes was compiled by using interactome data for verifying the functional connections among these proteins
[26,27]. This approach (i.e., combining GO, PubMed and
Interactome data) allowed us to establish a dataset consisting of 342 genes involved in apoptosis, whose products were physically or functionally interacting. The
experimentally supported data of interactions between
AM transcripts and MIRs were extracted from Tarbase
[28]. Recent comparative studies among target prediction
methods have shown that no single one of them is significantly better than others. Accordingly, it has become
common to use multiple prediction tools, concentrating
on the intersecting results, in order to overcome the wellknown problems related to MIR targets identification
[29]. In this project, we used miRGen [30], which intersects the results from three different classic tools
(miRanda, PicTar, and TargetScan) to predict the MIRs
controlling AM genes. The data about MIRs genomic position were extracted from miRBase [31].
Genomics
The cytogenetic and genomic position of each AM gene
was obtained by searching the database Gene of NCBI
[25]. The genome map of AM genes was displayed by
Caryoscope [32] to identify the position of AM genes in the
genome. The distribution of AM genes in each chromosome was compared to that of all human genes [33]. AM

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/2/20

cytogenetic map was compared to that of tumour-associated chromosomal structural mutations. The latter was
determined by using data from the Mitelman database
and CGH informations from Progenetix (a database of
cytogenetic abnormalities in cancer) for the most frequent
anatomic cancer sites (breast, cervix, colon, kidney, liver,
lung, neuroblastoma, ovary, pancreas, prostate, skin,
stomach, and thyroid) [34,35]. The overlap of the two
maps was examined through Caryoscope. A red-green
matrix (AM genes × tumours, in which the positive values
indicate the frequency of gains while the negative ones
indicate the frequency of losses) led to identification of
AM genes clusters: these were displayed with MeV4.2 [36].
The information on cancer-related gene mutations was
obtained by screening the database Cosmic [37]. Cancerrelated methylation data were from PubMeth [38].
Evolution
To characterize the phylogenetic distribution of AM proteins, we collected AM orthologs from a large number of
taxa [Prokaryotes (Bacteria, Archaea), Unicellular Eukaryotes (Alveolata, Diplomonadida group, Entamoebidae,
Euglenozoa, Mycetozoa), Viridiplantae, Fungi, Invertebrates
(Acoelomata, Pseudocoelomata, Protostomia), Vertebrates
(Actinopterygii, Amphibia, Sauropsida, Mammalia)] and
Viruses (both dsDNA viruses and retro-transcribing
viruses) from the databases Homologene [39], iProClass
[40] and Metazome [41]. The search for AM orthologs was
performed by using BLASTp with human AM proteins as
queries against all protein databases [42]. The total
number of organisms used for analyzing AM phylogenesis
was ninety. The evolutionary rate of AM proteins was
assessed by carrying out a multiple alignment (MA) of
each human protein with its orthologs from a series of
model organisms (Mus musculus, Gallus gallus, Xenopus laevis, Danio rerio, Takifugu rubripes, Drosophila melanogaster,
Caenorhabditis elegans, Dictyostelium discoideum, Bacillus
subtilis, Methanococcus jannaschii). MA was performed with
ClustalW [43], while aligned sequences were processed
with Mega 3.0 [44] to obtain the Poisson Corrected distance (k): this provides an estimate of the difference
between two sequences (meant as percentage of amino
acid substitutions) for all pairs of orthologs. The evolutionary rate (ν) was calculated through Kimura's parameter, ν = k/2 t, where t represents the time of divergence
between two species [45]. Histone H4 (a highly conserved
protein), SOD2 (a protein with an average degree of conservation) and Fibrinopeptide (a protein characterized by a
low conservation level) were used as evolutionary markers
[46]. The evolutionary rate was calculated for those proteins expressed at least in all vertebrates.
Transcriptomics
Gene expression data on AM genes were obtained from
three datasets: Human Transcriptome Map (HTM), NCI60

BMC Medical Genomics 2009, 2:20

Cancer Microarray Project, and Oncogenomics for cancer
and normal tissues [47-49]. Because of the small sample
size, fdr (false discovery rate) analysis with an empirical
null model (as proposed by Efron) was deemed infeasible. Instead, the t-test was applied to identify those genes
with expression values that differ significantly between
normal and tumour samples (for HTM and Oncogenomics datasets) in each cancer model. We performed a test
between subjects: Group A (normal tissues), Group B
(cancer tissues); Welch approximation; Alpha (overall
threshold p-value) = 0.001; the p-value is based on permutation (100 permutation per gene); the significance
was determined by the Adjusted Bonferroni Correction.
The resulting differentially expressed genes were further
analyzed: for each differentially expressed gene, in each
cancer model, we calculated the natural logarithm of the
ratio between the mean of expression values of group B
and the mean of expression values of group A. We chose
the stringent cut-off of +1 and -1 (about three fold up- or
down-regulated) to determine the up regulation and
down regulation, respectively: the genes with ln ratio values between +1 and -1 were considered not significantly
changed [50,51]. To further strengthen our analysis, we
compared and completed these data with expression values from NCI60 datasets (analyzed as described above).
Data analysis was performed and displayed with MeV4.2.
The overlapping of AM transcriptome map with the AM
mutation map was performed by Caryoscope. Expression
data on MIRs, that target AM genes in different normal
and tumour tissues, were derived from the database VITA
[52], which contains MIR profiling obtained from beadbased flow cytometry of mature forms of MIRs [53].
Proteomics
AM protein expression data were obtained from The
Human Protein Atlas and NCI60 protein datasets [54,55].
Due to the incomplete structure of these databases, some
important cancer-related proteins were not included in
our analysis. The data concerning protein features such as
PTM, the presence of metal ions or an intrinsically
unfolded structure, were obtained from HPRD and DisProt databases [27,56]. The structural characterization of
protein motifs and domains was performed by screening
the database ExPASy [57].
Interactomics
Data on protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions
were obtained from BIND [26] and HPRD [27] databases,
while pathway data are from Kegg and Biocarta [58,59].
The AM interactome was analyzed and visualized by Cytoscape [60], CentiBin [61], and iVici [62]. By using Cytoscape plug-ins, interactome data were interpolated with
structural information on AM proteins, to derive the relationships between structural motifs and interactions. Phenome data from knock-out experiments in the mouse

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/2/20

were obtained from Mouse Genome Informatics [63].
Drug targeting information was extracted from DrugBank
[64].
Cell lines and culture conditions
The K562 cell line was derived from a patient with CML in
blast crisis and expressing the chimaeric non-receptor
tyrosine kinase p210Bcr-Abl [65]. Cell were cultured in
RPMI 1640-glutamax, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco BRL), 2% Lglutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were grown
under 5% CO2/95% O2 in a 37°C humified incubator.
Imatinib (STI571, Gleevec) was provided by Novartis
Pharma (Basel, Switzerland). A 10 mM stock solution was
freshly prepared in sterile phosphate-buffered saline and
diluted in RPMI 1640 medium before use. K562 cells,
exposed to 1 μM imatinib and relative controls, were collected and analyzed at different time points (0 h, 2 h, 4 h,
7 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h). Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, derived from a patient with a bone marrow
metastasis [66], were grown in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM
and Ham's F-12 medium (Cambrex Bio Science, Verviers
Belgium), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco,
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), in a humidified atmosphere of
5% CO2 in air. For apoptosis induction, 3 × 106 cells were
seeded into 75 cm2 flasks in 15 ml of culture medium.
Fenretinide (dissolved in absolute ethanol) was added to
cultures to a final concentration of 3 μM; an equal volume
of ethanol (~0.3% of culture volume) was used to treat
control cells. SH-SY5Y cells exposed to 3 μM fenretinide
and relative controls were collected and analyzed at different time points (0 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h).
Cell population dynamics and detection of apoptosis or
necrosis
To detect apoptosis or necrosis, one aliquot (2 × 105 cells)
was used for flow cytometric analysis. Cell fluorescence
was assessed with a Facscalibur flow cytometer (Becton
Dickinson, San Jose, CA) by using the CellQuest software
(Becton Dickinson). Standard protocols were followed to
determine annexin-positivity with an Annexin V-FITC
Apoptosis Detection Kit (Sigma, Saint Louis, Missouri).
Real – time PCR
Total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen) from
treated cells and untreated controls after trypsinization
(for the neuroblastoma cell line) and centrifugation (for
both lines) at 1200 rpm for 10 min. Total RNA (3 μg) was
reverse-transcribed using SuperScript II and random hexamers (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany)
[19]. cDNA (30 ng) was added to each well of a PCR array
for quantitative PCR (Apoptosis PCR arrays and RT2 Profiler PCR Array, SuperArray Bioscience Corporation, MD,
USA). The array consisted of 96 primers for 84 genes of

Page 4 of 35

BMC Medical Genomics 2009, 2:20

AM core protein-encoding genes, plus five housekeeping
genes and three RNA and PCR quality controls. PCR cycles
were performed according to the manufacturer instructions. The relative level of mRNA expression for each gene
in each sample was first normalized to the expression of
housekeeping genes (also provided in the array) in treated
samples and then normalized with respect to the level of
cDNA expression in control samples according to the 2ΔΔCT method [67]. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on Mx3005P™ QPCR system (Stratagene, La Jolla,
CA, USA). The results were considered significant when
the expression of a specific cDNA was at least either three
times higher or lower than that of controls.

Results
Physiology
AM general features
The 342 protein-encoding genes, that we assigned to
Homo sapiens AM, encode 596 different mRNAs that are
translated into 548 proteins (Tables 1, 2; Additional files
1, 2): 25% of them are involved in apoptosis induction,
20% in its inhibition, 40% in regulation, 15% in tissue-,
pathway-, and disease-specific functions. Despite their
common involvement with apoptosis, AM proteins are
highly heterogeneous according to three GO categories:
(i) Biological Process; (ii) Molecular Function; (iii) Subcellular Location (Additional file 2). As expected, the most
represented biological process is apoptosis (65%), but
many also are involved in metabolism (54%) or cell communication (55%) (Additional file 2). The most frequent
molecular functions of AM proteins are receptor- or
kinase-activity within signal transduction pathways (20%
each), nucleic acid binding (17%), transcription factor
activity (9%) (Additional file 2); their most frequent subcellular localizations are the nucleus (51%), the plasma
membrane (43%), and mitochondria (10%) (Additional
file 2). We identified 110 MIRs whose targets are AM protein-encoding genes, of which fourteen had been experimentally validated (Additional files 1 and 3). We also
found other five MIR-encoding genes physically located
within introns of AM protein-encoding genes: while waiting for the experimental verification of their involvement
in AM functions, we propose to temporarily assign them
to the AM (Additional file 4). Accordingly, the total count
of AM genes would amount to 457. Interestingly, MIRs of
the Apoptotic Machinery preferentially target AM proteinencoding genes that negatively regulate apoptosis or control cell cycle through transcription factors and protein
serine/threonine kinases (Additional file 2).
AM genomics and evolution
AM genes are uniformly spread in the human genome,
including the pseudoautosomal regions of X and Y chromosomes (Additional file 5). However, we also identified
small clusters of phylogenetically related sequences: five

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/2/20

genes of the TNFR family and two DNA fragmentation factors are localized at 1p36; three interferon genes map at
9p21; two members of the BIRC family and four caspases
are at 11q22; three members of the STAT family are localized at 17q21; four members of the NALP family are localized at 19q13; two Interferon Receptors are at 21q22
(Additional file 6). These clusters are conserved in at least
two other mammals (Pan troglodytes and Mus musculus)
with the exception of CASP5 and NALP8, not found in the
mouse, and the CASP12 pseudogene that turns out to be
an expressed gene in both the chimpanzee and the mouse
(Additional file 6). We also detected MIR-encoding genes
physically located within introns or UTRs of AM proteinencoding genes; it is at present unknown if these MIRs are
involved in AM functions (Additional file 4). Phylogenetic analysis of unicellular eukaryotes demonstrated the
presence of several orthologs of human AM genes, for
instance Programmed Cell Death 5 and 6 (PDCD5 and
PDCD6) that are involved in apoptosis-like phenomena
(Figure 1, Panel A). About 4% of human AM genes,
belonging to different GO categories (transcription factors, kinases, regulators of the cell cycle or of proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis), appear to have orthologs
in Bacteria and Archaea; however, these genes are peripheral
rather than core AM nodes (Figure 1, Panel A). Cytochrome c is the only gene with a central role in apoptosis,
found in the Domains of both Prokarya and Archaea; in
metazoans the protein is a constitutive member of the
apoptosome, whilst in more ancestral organisms it is
mainly involved in oxidative phosphorylation (Figure 1,
Panel A). About 7% of human AM genes are found inside
viral genomes (both DNA and RNA viruses): they encode
transcription factors involved in cell cycle control, proliferation, and differentiation (Figure 1, Panel A). Our phylogenetic analysis of AM structure in a large series of
organisms confirmed the evolutionary increase of the
number of AM genes, concurrent with that of AM structure
complexity (Figure 1, Panel B). AM functional core (BCL2
family members, Death Associated Proteins, BAG, BIRC,
Caspases) appeared in multicellular organisms and was
enriched with new molecular elements (e.g., DEATH
receptors and their ligands, CARDs and TRAFs) with the
onset of vertebrates. The emergence of mammals coincided with a further increase in the number of AM genes:
this presumably was caused by the expansion of gene families that characterized the evolution of these genomes
(Figure 1, Panel B). Analysis of the evolutionary rate (v) of
AM proteins has allowed us to establish the evolutionary
trend of AM (Figure 1, Panel C). Most AM proteins show
a low or medium degree of conservation with respect to
the three evolutionary markers used (i.e., a v similar to
fibrinopeptide). However, there is a small group of proteins
(< 10%) characterized by a medium to high degree of conservation with a v value ranging between that of histone H4
and SOD2. These conserved proteins are involved in cell

cycle regulation (e.g., AKT3, members of the cullin family,
GSK3B, SRC), signal transduction (e.g., HRAS, MAPK,
PDCD6, YWHAE, YWHAG), protein metabolism and
post-translational modifications (e.g., BECN1, MASK,
RPL5, STK25) (Figure 1, Panel C).
AM proteomics
The molecular weight (MW) of AM proteins ranges
between 4,430 daltons (isoform 6 of E2F6) and 527,622
daltons (BIRC6). About 20% of these proteins have a MW
of approximately 20 kD (Additional file 7). Analysis of the
post-translational modifications of AM proteins from the
database HPRD showed that the most frequent are phosphorylation (35%) and proteolytic cleavage (15%). For
25% of these proteins there is no PTM information (Additional file 7). About 16% of AM proteins are metallo-proteins containing zinc (9.5%), calcium (3.2%),
magnesium (2.9%), iron ions (0.9%) (Additional file 7).
By scanning their primary structure, we identified 113 different motifs or domains with a total of 471 different
structural modules: as expected, many AM proteins com-

prise more than a single module (Additional file 8). Direct
structural characterization demonstrated that about 6.5%
of AM proteins are NUPs [56]. With the exclusion of structural modules widespread within the human proteome
(as the Protein Kinase domain and ANK Repeats), the
most frequent structural motifs (i.e., BH, CARD, CASP,
TNFR) are linked to AM core functions such as reception,
transduction and execution of death signals (Figure 2,
Panel A). By overlapping these data to the interactome, it
is possible to identify a hypothetical pathway of interactions among protein domains, coupling it to their propensity to perform anti- or pro-apoptotic functions (Figure 2,
Panel B). This analysis confirms previous literature data,
suggesting that the death domains CARD, DAPIN,
DEATH, DED can mediate and modulate both the reception as the transduction of apoptotic signals originating
from the plasma membrane (TNFR domains), and of
those incoming from mitochondria (BCL2 domains in all
their variants resulting from recombination of BH
motifs), up to the final effectors (CASP domains) (Figure
2, Panel B) [68]. The death domains may reciprocally

interact as homomers or heteromers (CARD and DED), as
they do with other protein domains that control their signal transduction activity (i.e., MATH) (Figure 2, Panel B).
Core AM nodes are negatively regulated by: (1) the BAG
domain, which negatively modulates the BCL2 domains
of pro-apoptotic proteins; (2) the BIR domain, which
represses the CASP domains [68]. This model is based on
high-throughput interactome data (see Methods) and is
consistent with other motif interaction maps [69-72],
even though some of its specific details are different
respect to low-throughput data [6,21,73]. Typically, the
comparison between HT analysis and tests performed
gene by gene (or protein by protein) results in a mismatched set of data [74,75]. This is especially true for
interactome data. The very large spectrum of the analysis
is generally coupled to low-confidence results. However,
as demonstrated by a large amount of literature [22,76],
the worth of HT data remains valid because they allow us
to observe the behaviour of a whole system (a cell or a
molecular machinery).
AM interactomics and molecular networks
According to BIND and HPRD data, protein-protein and
protein-nucleic acids interactions are known for 86% of AM
genes for which we found 1012 interactions (Figure 3, Panel
A). The AM network is structurally and functionally based on
the interactions among members of the BCL2, Caspase, and
STAT families, which comprise about 42% of all links (Figure
3, Panel B). Its hubs, interacting with more than 10% of their
neighbours, are CASP3 (13.5%), CASP8 (12.4%), TRAF2
(12%), and BCL2 (11%). By considering different centrality
measures (betweenness, centroid, closeness, degree, eccentricity), the most central AM nodes are AKT1, CASP3, CASP8,
MAPK1 (Figure 3, Panel C). These nodes, as many others
with high centrality such as BCL2 or TRAF2, represent lethal
embryonic perinatal or lethal postnatal genes in the mouse
(MGI phenome data). Inside the AM network we identified
two clusters of highly interconnected nodes: (a) the BCL2
family interaction cluster (BAX, BAK1, BCL2, BCL2L1, and
BCL2L10); (b) the STAT family interaction cluster (CSF2RB,
EPOR, NMI, STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A, and STAT5B). This
could be potentially important for understanding the functional relationships among these gene in physiology and
pathology. By comparing the human AM network with that
of M. Musculus, C. elegans, D. Melanogaster, we found that the
interactions between BCL2/APAF1, BCL2/BAX, BIRCs/
CASPs, CASP9/APAF1, and CASPs/CASPs were conserved in
these organisms (Figure 4). Interestingly, we failed to find
any significant correlation between network centrality and
specific phenotypic features.
Pathology
AM oncogenomics
By overlapping the AM genome map with the chromosome
aberration map in tumours, we found that AM proteinencoding genes at 8q23 and 8q24 are potentially involved in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/2/20

gain-type mutations (duplication or amplification) with a
frequency higher than 20% in about 50% of cancers. This
also occurs with AM genes at 1q23 and 1q32 (about 40% of
cancers). On the contrary, AM genes at 8p21 and 8p22 are
located in regions that are loss-prone in 35% of cancers (Figure 5, Panel A; Additional file 9). The most represented cancers in this amplification/deletion AM map are
neuroblastoma (146 AM protein encoding genes), lung (84
AM protein encoding genes), pancreas (79 AM protein
encoding genes) (Figure 6, Panel A). MIRs regulating the
expression of AM genes (most frequently endowed with antiapoptotic functions) also are localized in regions frequently
altered in cancer: MIR9-1, MIR29B2, MIR29C, MIR181B1,
MIR199A2, MIR205, MIR213 map to chromosome 1 long
arm, a gain-prone region in 6 out of 14 of cancer models; the
same is true for MIR30B and MIR30D, both localized at
8q24.22, a gain-region in 7/14 of cancer models (Figure 5,
Panel B). On the other hand, MIR124A1 and MIR320 are
localized in loss-prone regions in 5/14 of the models (Figure
5, Panel B). Screening of databases for somatic mutation in
cancer demonstrated that the most frequently mutated AM
protein-encoding genes are the protooncogene BRAF
(mutated in 100% of cancer models) and the tumour suppressors CDKN2A and TP53. The latter two are altered in
100% and 90% of cancer models analyzed, respectively
(Table 3; Figure 6, Panel B). BRAF is frequently subject to
point mutations in skin and thyroid cancers (41% and 36%,
respectively), but at much lower frequencies in the other
tumour types (1–5%). CDKN2A is mutated in about 10–
15% of samples, with the highest incidence in pancreas
tumours. Point mutations were detected at the TP53 locus
with an incidence of about 50% in each tumour model, with
a maximum of 83% in thyroid neoplasms (Figure 6, Panel
B). Intriguingly, BRAF, CDKN2A, TP53, RB1 are frequently
co-mutated in the same cancer types, strongly suggesting that
this co-occurrence could be important for activation or progression of the neoplastic process (Table 3).
AM epigenomics
According to PubMeth, DAPK1, PYCARD, RB1, and TP73
are methylated in at least half of our fourteen cancer models (Table 4). According to our transcriptome data, DAPK1
(reported to be a tumor suppressor candidate) is down
expressed in breast, colon cancer, leukemia, neuroblastoma and is methylated in all models analyzed. However,
unlike other hypermethylated genes, DAPK1 is localized
in a genomic region that is never loss-prone in cancer.
This could suggest that its down regulation, possibly relevant in some cancer phenotypes, may be obtained
through aberrant methylation rather than genome mutations, possibly because the deletion of its chromosomal
region could impair the vitality of the cell.

expression of AM protein-encoding genes in breast, colon,

kidney, leukaemia, liver, lung, neuroblastoma, ovary,
pancreas, prostate, skin, stomach, and thyroid, we identified those that are transcriptionally deregulated in these
tumours (Figure 7, Panel A; Additional file 10). Expression of these AM genes is frequently altered in neuroblastoma and leukaemia (about 60% and 52%, respectively)
(Figure 7, Panel B). Our analysis showed that AATF,
LGALS3, and SRC are up regulated in 8/13 of cancer models, and CDC2L2, E2F6, LGALS9, PDCD8, RELB, TRADD,
and TRAF2 in 7/13 (Figure 7, Panel A; Additional file 10).
On the other hand, the most frequently down regulated
AM genes are TGFBR2 (7/13 of cancer models), BAG3,

CLU, LGALS1, LTBR, SGK (in 6/13) (Figure 7, Panel A;
Additional file 10). Notably, comparison of AM transcriptome patterns suggests that each cancer model has its own
specific AM transcriptome profile, even if some (e.g.,
leukemia and neuroblastoma) showed similar patterns
(Figure 7, Panel C). Not surprisingly, the positive regulators of apoptosis tend to be down regulated in all cancer
models (in particular in cancers of the ovary and thyroid);
also the negative regulators of apoptosis are generally
down regulated in most models, except for pancreas, prostate, thyroid cancers in which they are up regulated
instead. These data confirm the complexity of the cancer

genome alterations and further emphasize the need for a
System Biology approach to its pathogenesis and therapy
(Figure 8, Panels A, B).
AM transcriptomics: MIR-encoding genes
By searching the database VITA, we determined the
expression profile of MIRs predicted to target AM proteins
in colon, kidney, lung, pancreas, prostate cancers (Figure
9, Panels A, B). Our analysis demonstrated that different
AM proteins, that are up regulated in different cancers, are
computationally predicted targets of MIRs, that are down
regulated in the same tumours (Table 5). In particular,
CUL3, over expressed in kidney and prostate cancers, is a
target of several dysregulated MIRs: MIR22, MIR23A,
MIR23B, MIR218-1, MIR218-2, and MIR301, which are
down regulated in kidney cancers, and of MIR22,
MIR23A, MIR181A, and MIR181C, which are down regulated in prostate cancers (Table 5). These data supply a list
of new candidate MIRs possibly involved in cancer (Table
5). Our proposal is strengthened by the presence, within
this list, of MIRs that were already experimentally demonstrated to target AM protein encoding genes (Additional

file 3). In fact, we found that in lung cancer over expression of BCL2 could be explained by the under expression
of MIR15A, MIR16-1, and MIR16-2, while in kidney
tumours over expression of DFFB, HTATIP and RELA
could be related to the under expression of MIR124A-1,
MIR124A-2, and MIR124A-3 (Table 5). Similar to the
AATK gene that contains it, also MIR338 is up regulated in
neuroblastoma (M Ragusa et al., 2009, submitted).
AM genomics vs transcriptomics
Overlapping the chromosomal mutation map to AM
expression profiles in each cancer model showed that
28% of AM genes with transcriptional alterations were
located in genomic regions potentially mutated in neoplasia. The highest rate of overlapping was found in prostate
cancers (50% in regions of gain, 11% in regions of loss)
and neuroblastoma (35% in regions of gain, 29% in
regions of loss), whilst the lowest was in lung (7% in
regions of gain, 2.5% in regions of loss) and liver cancers
(8.5% in regions of gain, 4.4% in regions of loss) (Figure
10; Additional file 11). We overlapped the MIR transcriptome to CGH-array data in colon, kidney, lung, pancreas,

and prostate tumours. Prostate cancer is the one with the
highest number of altered genomic regions and concomitant aberrant expression of MIR genes (50% of regions
with gain- or loss-mutations also show up- or down regulation of their MIRs). In many cases we found that down
regulation of a MIR could correspond to the heterozygous
deletion of the encoding gene (Table 6).

AM proteomics
By performing the normalization and discretization of
AM protein expression in cancers of the breast, colon, kidney, leukaemia, liver, lung, neuroblastoma, ovary, pancreas, prostate, skin, stomach, thyroid, we identified a set
of proteins that are dysregulated in these tumours (Figure
11, Panels A, B). EP300, ISGF3G, STAT1, and STAT3 are

up regulated in 8/13 of cancer models, while ATM, BAX,
BCL2L11, HTATIP2, LGALS3, MAPK1, and TP73L are
down regulated in half of cancer models (Figure 11, Panel
A). By overlapping protein expression data to transcriptome data, we identified the AM genes with transcriptome
alterations mirroring their proteome dysregulation (Table
7). Because of this degree of consistency, these genes may
be assumed to represent relevant cancer candidates in different tumour models. We found that this correlation was
more evident in leukemia (17.4% of up regulated, and
7.6% of down regulated), liver cancer (27% of up regulated, and 5.5% of down regulated), and neuroblastoma
(18.7% of up regulated, and 13% of down regulated) (Fig-

ure 12, Panel A). We also identified those genes that are
potentially rearranged (both gain- or loss-type of mutation) and have altered transcriptome and proteome
expression (Table 8). Cancers showing a noteworthy overlapping of genome mutations, transcriptome dysregulation and altered protein expression were pancreatic
tumours and neuroblastoma for up- or down regulated
AM proteins, and lung cancers for down regulated AM
proteins (Figure 12, Panel B). Analysis of the function of
dysregulated AM proteins showed that the positive regulators of apoptosis tend to be down regulated in all cancer
models, whereas the negative regulators of apoptosis generally tend to be up regulated in most models (Figure 13,

Panels A, B). The same analysis performed on AM genes
with common transcriptome/proteome alterations
showed a tendency to flattening of the anti/pro genes balance.
AM interactomics and molecular networks
Analysis of the relationship between the link number of a
gene to genome mutations and transcriptome alterations
allowed us to discover that the genes with more links to
mutated genes are more likely to be dysregulated in
tumours (Figure 14). Our analysis demonstrates that the
hubs of the AM network typically represent the nodes with
the highest number of genome, transcriptome or proteome alterations in all cancer models analyzed, even
though the oncogenic relevance of each hub seems to be
tumour (or tumour group) – specific (Additional file 12).
Moreover, we found that the average degree of the
mutated nodes is significantly higher than the average
degree of not mutated ones (p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon signedrank test). Intriguingly, approximately 70% of NUPs are
nodes with a higher degree of connectivity than the average AM proteins and some of them are hubs (i.e., AKT1,

BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2A, and TP53): indeed, the NUPs
showed a higher degree (degree > 17) than the other nonNUP proteins (p < 0.01, Fisher's exact test).
AM pharmacogenomics
By plotting the available data related to drugs targeted at
the AM network, we found that most of AM proteins targeted by drugs were characterized by high connectivity;
particularly, there was a highly significant association
between the betweenness of these proteins and their being
targets of drugs (p < = 0.004072, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank
Test) (Figure 15).
Apoptosis induced by imatinib in K562 cells and by fenretinide in SHSY5Y cells
A time course FACS analysis with Annexin V-FITC demonstrated that following treatment of K562 cells with Imatinib 1 μM, annexin-positive cells appeared 12 h after
treatment (17% of treated cells). The percentage of apoptotic cells reached its peak 24 h after treatment (22.3%),
while the conclusion of the apoptotic process apparently
occurred within 72 h (Figure 16, Panel A). Real time PCR

transcriptome analysis of 84 AM core genes was performed at 4 h after induction (before K562 cells had
shown any phenotypic sign of apoptosis) and at 24 h (at
the peak of apoptosis according to annexin positivity)
(Figure 16, Panel A). When checked with the 2-ΔΔCT
method, the 4 h point showed no significant change of
AM genes expression with respect to the control, while the
same analysis at the 24 h point revealed remarkable modifications in the transcriptome: these consisted of an up
regulation of the genes that trigger or positively control
the apoptotic mitochondrial pathway (proapoptotic
members of the BCL2 family, inhibitors of BCL2 and BCLXL, apoptosome members), caspases (CASP3, CASP4,
CASP6, CASP7, CASP8, and CASP9), or their positive regulators. More specifically, the following pro-apoptotic AM
genes reached a peak of expression at this time point:
APAF1, BCLAF1, BIK, TNFSF10, and TNFRSF25 (Figure
16, Panel C). TP73 was over expressed with respect to the
control, suggesting a possible activation of a DNA repair
pathway or the activation of genes that positively control
apoptosis or negatively modulate the cell cycle. The
increased expression of many caspases is concomitant to
the up regulation of BIRC family members (caspases
inhibitors), suggesting a co-existing subpopulation of
cells resistant to apoptosis induction (Figure 16, Panel C).
Focusing on the specific biological pathways activated in
this model, we found that most of the AM genes down
regulated at 24 h belong to the TNF/Stress Related Signaling and SODD/TNFR1 Signaling Pathways, while the
members of the caspase cascade and mitochondrial apoptotic signalling were all up regulated. Among the AM
genes whose expression was apparently unaffected in our
model, about 70% are potential candidates for involvement in leukemia (Figure 16, Panel D). The Annexin-V
propidium test on SH-SY5Y, treated with fenretinide 3
μM, showed that apoptosis peaked 24 h after drug administration and was apparently concluded at 72 h (Figure 16,
Panel B). A real time PCR analysis of AM core genes was
performed in the early phases of treatment (12 h), at the
point with the highest percentage of annexin positive cells

(26%) (24 h), and at the conclusion of the process (72 h).
Expression of pro-apoptotic genes GADD45A, TNFRSF1A,
and TNFRSF10A peaked at 24 h. Similar to K562 cells, the
real-time expression data in treated SH-SY5Y cells showed
a massive activation at 72 h of the caspase family genes
CASP1, CASP4, CASP5, CASP10, and CASP14, including
CASP8, that is emi-methylated in the SH-SY5Y cell line
and has been reported to be induced after fenretinide
treatment [77] (Figure 16, Panel C). 72 h after treatment
both pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl2 family
were induced: some pro-apoptotic members (i.e., BAX,
BCL2L10, BCL2L11) began to increase slightly starting at
24 h, while some anti-apoptotic genes (i.e., BCL2,
BCL2A1, MCL1.) were down regulated at 24 h. Death
receptors and their ligands (CD40, CD40LG, CD70, FAS,
FASLG, LTBR, TNF, TNFRSF11B, TNFRSF21, TNFSF8,
TNFSF10) decreased during the post-treatment interval 12
h – 24 h, reaching their highest expression at 72 h; expression of the transducers AKT1 and RIPK2 followed a similar kinetics. Interestingly, the caspase inhibitors BIRCs, in
particular BIRC8, showed an increased expression at 72 h.
TP53 and TP73 expression values were lower at 24 h than
at 12 h and increased at 72 h, while GADD45A exhibited
its peak of expression at 24 h (Figure 16, Panel C). By analyzing the modulation of the biological pathways, we
found that during the interval 12 h – 24 h many genes
involved in the Caspase cascade and the TNF pathways
were transcriptionally down regulated, while during the
interval 24 h – 72 h most of genes up regulated were members of the Fas and TNF pathways, the Caspase cascade
and the mitochondrial apoptotic signalling. The number
of core AM genes, transcriptionally changed after Fenretinide administration, increased during the time course
(about 34% and 50% at 24 h and 72 h, respectively) (Figure 16, Panel D). Similar to K562 cells, an important fraction of transcriptionally unaltered genes (about 60%) are
candidates, previously identified for their potential
involvement in neuroblastoma: as with the K562 cell line,
this may suggest that their activation is prevented by critical mutations. Again similar to K562 cells, we also

Discussion
The omic characterization of the apoptotic machinery: a
model for a system biology approach to Homo sapiens
biopathology
Understanding the molecular bases of complex and biomedically important phenotypes, as cancer and degenerative diseases, is one of the critical challenges for
contemporary BioMedicine [14,78]. Different approaches
have been proposed to explain cancer onset and heterogeneity, ranging from the study of single genes to large-scale
system analysis [79,80]. The molecular oncology data
obtained in the last decades have shown that the neoplastic phenotype is mainly due to genetic or epigenetic
defects of two complex molecular machineries: the Cell
Cycle and DNA Replication Apparatus (CCDRA) and the

Apoptotic Machinery (AM) [22,82,83]. Typically, the biopathology of tumour cells is double faced: these cells are
prone to uncontrolled proliferation with a scarce propensity to differentiate [84,85], but they also possess an ever
evolving tendency to escape cell death: the consequent
immortality provides them with a strong selective advantage over the wild-type ones, also endowing them with
resistance to chemotherapy. Accordingly, many mutations
and dysregulations of CCDRA and AM genes are found in
all cancer types [22,82,83]. However, the involvement of
apoptosis dysfunctions in cancer has remained elusive at
the system level. Based on these premises, we decided to
characterize the Omics of the Apoptotic Machinery for
using them: (i) as a tool to identify new cancer genes; (ii)
to profile cancers for diagnostic purposes; and finally, (iii)
to pinpoint new targets for pharmacological therapy. Our
data suggest that the potential involvement of AM genes is
heterogeneous in different cancer models, both for
number and type of chromosomal breakpoints as for frequency of genomic mutations, suggesting heterogeneity
of pathogenesis (Figures 5, 6). The highest levels of chromosomal mutations involving AM loci were observed in

the presence of molecular motifs favouring specific interactions. Its complexity further increased with the arrival of
mammals, very likely due to the expansion of gene families that characterized their evolution (Figure 1) [90-92].
This is a common trend in the evolution of Eukaryotes,
previously observed for other molecular machineries such
as those controlling intracellular molecular trafficking or
RNA interference [93,94]. The analysis of a more complex
molecular apparatus (such as CCDRA) showed that Homo
sapiens shares only 60% of its CCDRA genes with other
eukaryotes (e.g., Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis
thaliana). Interestingly, a sizeable fraction of the genes
expressed during the cell cycle do not have orthologs in all
the organisms analyzed: this suggests that each species
may also synthesize a different and specific set of cell cycle
proteins [95,96]. By analogy, the presence of different AM
transcriptome profiles in different organisms could be
expected. Phylogenetic analysis of unicellular eukaryotes
identified orthologs of several AM genes encoding transcription factors and kinases, that in Metazoa are involved
in the control of cell cycle, proliferation, differentiation
and apoptosis (Figure 1). This could suggest that a molecular apparatus, responsible for the execution of a genetically guided form of cell death, was present in the first
Eukaryotes: however, many of the genes performing it
seem to be exclusive of unicellular eukaryotes [97]. As
expected, higher Eukaryotes share only few AM genes with
Bacteria. It seems logical to hypothesize that the biomolecular function of these proteins could be different in the
two Domains and not necessarily bear a functional relationship with cell death in Bacteria (original sin hypothesis) [10,98]. AM genes shared with viral genomes (both
DNA and RNA viruses) are transcription factors involved
in the control of cell cycle, proliferation, differentiation
and in the MAP kinase pathway. These viral genes possess
an oncogenic potential and presumably are the result of a
horizontal gene transfer from vertebrates [99]. Most AM
proteins show a medium-to-low conservation degree and
have an evolutionary rate similar to that of fibrinopeptide
(Figure 1). This high rate of evolution suggests a relaxed
structure/function relationship, that would allow them to
stand many types of mutations without impairing their
biological role. Many AM genes were found to be mutated
in different types of neoplasia. Indeed, the loss of the selfdestruction ability of a cell gives it an immediate selective
advantage over the others, even though it may be detrimental for the whole organism [100]. Furthermore,
almost 50% of AM genes are members of a gene family:
these genes tend to evolve more quickly because of the
functional redundancy that characterizes the family after
their duplication [101,102]. AM proteins characterized by
a medium-to-high conservation degree (< 10%) are
peripheral AM nodes, frequently at the boundaries with
other cell machineries: they also are involved in other
important functions, as cell cycle regulation (e.g., AKT3,
the members of the cullin family, GSK3B, and SRC), sigPage 28 of 35

nal transduction (e.g., HRAS, MAPK, PDCD6, YWHAE,
YWHAG), metabolism, post-translational modifications
(e.g., BECN1, MASK, RPL5, STK25) (Figure 1). Their biological role mainly consists in the regulation of the activity
of receptors, transductors, and executors of the apoptotic
program. Since they perform a critical role, these molecules were subjected to a strong selective pressure and
have largely preserved structure and functions. In many
cases, these proteins function within some of the most
ancient biological processes: about 50% of these molecules are found in unicellular Eukaryotes and in Prokaryotes (e.g., the MAP kinases) [103]. Our data confirm
results previously published on the evolution of the
human genome: proteins operating in regulatory processes (e.g., transcription factors and receptors) have
remained relatively well conserved during eukaryotic evolutions [104]. However, it remains true that the most conserved genes are those involved in such critical biological
processes as metabolism, protein synthesis, and molecular transport [104]. Our data seem also to suggest that in
most of cancer models the genome regions most frequently affected by loss-type mutations contain the most
conserved AM genes, suggesting a strong phenotype – genotype correlation (see Results, Oncogenomics).
Specificity of the AM transcriptome: cancer profiling
The analysis of the AM transcriptome profile showed that
the transcriptional involvement of this apparatus is heterogeneous in different cancer models for number and type
of AM genes involved. These data suggest that AM could
be involved in different tumours through tumour-specific
mechanisms of transcriptional activation or repression
[105,106]. According to our data, the main sources of AM
transcriptional failure are represented by apoptosis regulators (i.e., transcription factors, kinases, and death receptors) rather than by its executors (e.g., members of the
apoptosome, death transductors, and caspases) (Figure
7). This could suggest that frequently exploited mechanisms for cancer transformation are mutations of the
genes at the top of the death signalling network: they are
generally at the boundaries with other molecular machineries involved in cancer, such as the CCDRA or the DRM,
and could have a pleiotropic effect on the activities of several other genes (Figure 7). The identification of specific
AM molecular signatures (cancer profiling) could be useful for precise tumour diagnosis and specific therapy
design, distinguishing the different molecular alterations
associated to different tissues. As the number of AM genes
transcriptionally altered in cancers is reasonably limited
(between 25 and 200), specific low-cost platforms for AM
transcriptome analysis could be designed for routine
molecular screening of patients to understand the origin
of the cancer and its metastases [107,108]. Furthermore,
the comparison of molecular profiles would allow: (i) the
identification of the common alterations among tumours;

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/2/20

(ii) to understand the common basis of AM involvement
in cancer transformation [107,108]. It is notable that a
fraction of AM transcriptome dysregulations could be the
result of an altered control of expression of these genes,
triggered by the metabolism and cell cycle imbalance, and
characteristic of neoplastic cells; in some cases, they could
be due to aberrant gene methylation [83]. Various transcriptome alterations were mirrored in the proteome and
in some cases we also detected the corresponding
genomic mutations (Figure 12). This approach allowed us
to obtain a list of very reliable candidates for the malfunctioning apoptosis in cancer cells (Tables 7, 8). It is interesting to note that our functional analysis on AM
dysregulated genes and proteins, based on GO, showed a
possible different regulation of anti-apoptotic and proapoptotic genes. This could have different explanations:
(i) its molecular basis could be a qualitative and quantitative mismatch between transcriptome and proteome, possibly due to post-transcriptional modifications, the latter
being the real cause of cell phenotype [109,110]; (ii) the
apoptotic cascade is mainly a protein signalling network
based on protein/protein interaction and PTM (posttranslational modification), frequently proteolysis and
phosphorylation: usually, cells have most of the apoptotic
actors constitutively present but in the inactive state [7];
(iii) blocking of apoptosis does not necessarily require a
global down-regulation of all pro-apoptotic genes or an
overall up-regulation of all anti-apoptotic genes: in principle, it is sufficient that the expression of only a few of
these genes (logically the hubs of the AM network, acting
as masters) were altered to functionally modify cell behaviour [111]. We should expect that the relationship
between AM qualitative alterations and the neoplastic
phenotype is neither consistent nor simple to read [112].
AM network and cancer therapy
The mere qualitative and quantitative analysis of the alterations of a molecular machinery could be misleading, if
not inserted in a tetradimensional scenario (the three
dimensions of space plus time) that would allow one to
detect the relevance and the functional influence of all the
elements of the machinery within the organism. The AM
network shows a very interesting structure. Namely,
approximately 50% of its core proteins (effectors and
executor of death) have at least one death domain
(DEATH, DED, CARD, and DAPIN): this demonstrates a
very efficient strategy of modular signal transduction (Figures 2, 4). Only a few modules are sufficient to establish
the reciprocal interactions among at least 50 different proteins. The relatively small number of functionally related
protein modules within AM suggests a possible evolutionary pathway. Most likely, when the molecular machinery
responsible for apoptosis first appeared, it may have comprised a small group of proteins, characterized by few
classes of motifs and domains, which allowed reciprocal

protein interactions to induce, transduct and execute the
apoptotic process. The subsequent gene duplication
events and the phenomena of exon shuffling or meiotic
recombination determined the evolution of the apparatus. This phase included its growth by accretion due to the
recruitment of new interacting partners, spurred by newly
acquired molecular sequences important for specific
molecular interactions [88,89]. However, the structural
and functional protein modules remained unchanged,
together with the signals modulating and executing apoptosis [113,114]. Some AM proteins are NUPs: this suggests
that for an appropriate control of apoptosis it may be useful that some proteins possess a malleable structure,
endowing them with functional features not shown by
other rigidly ordered proteins involved in death signalling
[115,116]. The advantages of the great conformational
freedom of NUPs are the ability to fold upon binding to
their biological targets (coupled folding and binding) and
an increased speed of interaction. Their extended structure
and freedom in orientational search enable them to contact their partners over a large binding surface and to recognize distant determinants on the target [115,116]. This
flexibility may be critical for the assembly of specific macromolecular complexes, which cannot be made of rigid
components because of their sizes and topological constraints. Finally, the NUPs have an extreme proteolytic
sensitivity that allows them to very rapidly turn over upon
receiving appropriate signals. We found that NUPs typically represent the hubs of the AM network, suggesting
that their structural plasticity makes them very important
for the biology of the cell (Figure 6). Malfunctions of these
dynamic nodes affect the stability of the network and seriously modify cell behaviour. It is not surprising that many
cancer-related AM genes carrying point mutations are
NUPs, in particular some of those frequently mutated (as
HRAS, TP53, and CDKN2A) (Figure 6). The analysis of
AM alterations related to cancer, based on a network view,
has pinpointed the critical role of the hubs, the structurally and functionally most important nodes of the network, which could critically impair network's stability and
accordingly the physiologic status of the cell [117]. In fact,
these nodes are lethal – embryonic perinatal or lethal
postnatal genes in knock-out mice, and unsurprisingly
they show genomic alterations, coupled to transcriptional
dysregulations, in many cancer models [118,119]. Moreover, we found that highly connected nodes are frequently
mutated (Table 3; Figures 3, 6). All these data seem to suggest that tumour-related defects, occurring in the hubs of
AM, are preferentially selected. The functional impairment of a few nodes, which control directly or indirectly
the activities of many others in the context of the co-occurrence of multiple genetic defects, could represent a selective advantage during neoplastic transformation
(Additional file 12). The relationship between network
connectivity and molecular alterations of AM is also

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/2/20

stressed by our observation that the genes with more links
to mutated genes are themselves highly susceptible to be
dysregulated in cancer (Figure 14). We propose to exploit
this approach, based on the search for nodes connected to
AM mutated hubs, to discover new cancer biomarkers
[22]. Accordingly, the knowledge of the critical role of AM
hubs in the neoplastic phenotype could provide us with a
powerful strategy for designing targeted pharmacological
treatment. Apoptosis induction as strategy for cancer treatment is one of the most exploited therapeutic approaches.
As we have shown in this paper, activation of cell death is
the common result of the administration of different
drugs (e.g., Imatinib and Fenretinide) in different cancer
types (e.g., CML and neuroblastoma). Imatinib and Fenretinide work by triggering different AM pathways of
molecular signalling (by blocking the ATP binding site of
BCR-ABL or by highly increasing the production of ROS,
respectively). However, these biochemical cascades lead
to the same final event: apoptotic death [120,121]. The
real – time transcriptome analysis of K562 and SH-SY5Y
cells (treated with Imatinib and Fenretinide, respectively)
showed similar expression trends, although with a different correlation to the corresponding morphological
events (Figure 16). This analysis agrees with the observation that their AM dysregulation profiles at steady-state
are very similar (Figure 7, Panel C). Caspase activation,
coupled to the triggering of mitochondrial death and partial suppression of the extrinsic death pathway, are the
common changes observed in both cancer cell lines following pharmacological administration. The transcriptome changes observed during apoptosis induction
involved both AM genes dysregulated in cancer as AM
genes previously thought to be unaffected (Additional file
10). We note that the expression of some AM genes, previously identified as candidates for leukaemia and neuroblastoma, was apparently unchanged in our models:
this behaviour may suggest they may have suffered functional impairment, due to genomic mutations or epigenetic modifications. The choice of the molecular cascade,
leading to drug induced – apoptosis, is probably constrained by defects in some parts of the death machinery
(e.g., mutations or epigenetic repression of death receptors). Therefore, the knowledge of the cancer-associated
alterations of AM could be a critical tool to predict
whether a pharmacological treatment, based on apoptosis
induction, will be effective [20,122]. The proposal to
identify all of the weak points along the AM network of
specific cancers could be exploited for designing pathwayspecific therapies to induce apoptosis in tumours. This
strategy could be especially useful for those cancers that
apparently are very resistant to death induction: the exact
knowledge of their AM's Achilles' heels should allow the
identification of alternative molecular targets, usable to
induce apoptosis by new unaffected and unexplored pathways [123]. As the hubs seem to be the major actors in

apoptosis defects related to cancer, they could be considered very appropriate targets for drug design. In fact, we
are not surprised that most of AM proteins, targeted by
drugs, are characterized by a high degree of "betweenness"
(Figure 15). These characteristics indicate their relevance
as organizing regulators within a specific network and
their potential influence on maintaining the functions of
signalling mechanisms [124]. Ideally, drugs should be
selected so as to preferentially target proteins controlling
complex signalling cascades, rather than functionally isolated nodes: consequently, they would affect the behaviour of the cell in a significant way to produce relevant
clinical effects (Figure 15). Moreover, the pharmacological targeting of the critical nodes of the AM network
should be extended also to small RNAs that participate in
regulating apoptosis. Our data suggest that more than 100
MIRs potentially target AM genes. These MIRs are localized in frequently altered regions in cancer and have an
altered expression in many tumours (Figures 5, 9; Tables
5, 6). As already reported [125,126], MIRs have an important role in the pathogenesis of cancer and it may be
expected that many of them could have a critical function
in determining defects of AM functions [127,128]. Knowledge of dysregulated MIRs and their target specificity
could be used for new therapeutic approaches based on
blocking the up regulated MIRs (e.g., by using the antagomirs) or restoring their function (by MIR transfection with
liposoluble or synthetic carriers, such as microspheres)
[129,130]. The use of MIRs as therapeutic repressors of
oncogenes would be an innovative medical strategy,
which could improve the efficacy of traditional pharmacological therapies, or in some cases replace it [131].

Conclusion
We suggest that the Omic characterization of the Apoptotic Machinery, a critically important biological apparatus, could pave the way for further studies and critical
applications in the world of Molecular BioMedicine with
important perspectives both for Oncology as well as for
Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Biology (D Barbagallo, S Piro, M Ragusa et al., 2009, submitted). We are
encouraged to believe that this approach, if also applied
to other cell machineries as CCDRA and DRA, will eventually allow the identification of the molecular signals
critically involved in not just the normal functioning of an
organism, but also in its differentiation from the zygote.
Time could now be ripe for the emergence of a new
research field, that under the name of Signal Biology
could focus on the search for the determinants of specific
molecular interactions within organisms and their cells.
Such a field would rely on the vast amount of biomolecular data already available and amenable to manipulation
by the wide set of tools devised by the Computational

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/2/20

Biology and Experimental BioMedicine communities.
Data from these integrated studies should be critically
important to deepen our knowledge of development and
differentiation, as well as of biological complexity and its
relationship to the phenotype. They should also help to
intelligently devise strategies for therapeutic interventions
and individualized Medicine, and eventually for fulfilling
the promises of Synthetic Biology and Bionics [132,133].
