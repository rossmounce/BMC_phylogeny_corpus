When Carl von Linné published his work Systema Naturae
[1] he laid the foundation for the literature that builds the
science of taxonomy. For scientists today, permanent
access to the original species descriptions published since
von Linné's time is of crucial importance. Every new generation of taxonomists builds on the work of their predecessors and adds to the mind-boggling enterprise of
describing the earth's entire biodiversity at the level of single species. Following 250 years of taxonomy, around 1.8
million species of animals, plants and microorganisms are
known to science, whilst the total number of species
might be between 10 and 100 million [2]. There is no
time to waste in filling the knowledge gap, with biodiversity under threat and the reality that many species die out
before we even know about their existence.
A new breed of scientists, 'cybertaxonomists' and 'biodiversity informaticians', are now setting up a framework to
deal with the bank of data that has been collected in the
last 250 years and to help share what will be gathered in
the future. The common aim is not only to have an easily
accessible record of species descriptions, but to cross-link
different types of biodiversity data, connecting for example biogeography, climate data and phylogenetic information and also to incorporate new technologies like GPS
tracking and advanced imaging techniques. Several webbased initiatives are devoted to this research program,
each with a slightly different goal. For example, the vision
of Encyclopedia of Life (EoL) [3], as expressed by Edward O.
Wilson, is:
""Imagine an electronic page for each species of organism on
Earth, available everywhere by single access on command."

Over a period of five years, EoL plans to generate a million
species pages and to digitize biodiversity literature.
Another example of a project aimed at stitching together
information technology and biodiversity research is the
Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) [4]. GBIF
aims to provide an informatic architecture to make primary biodiversity data accessible to everyone. These and
similar projects are driven by the spirit of data sharing that
has been so beneficial throughout the history of science.
Such initiatives bring together data from various fields,
but at the heart of all these efforts are individual species,
some of them first described and named ages ago, most of
them yet to be known. The critical challenge that taxonomists face is to maintain continuity in their century-spanning mission, while adapting to the revolution in
information technology.
To avoid uncertainty and provide rules for the naming of
new animal taxa, the International Committee for Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) [5] has provided elaborate
guidance, for example in deciding which name has priority should more than one name appear in the literature for
the same species. Most scientists agree that the current version of this code needs to be revised to make taxonomy fit
for the digital future. Access to sometimes very specialized
primary literature, often aimed at an audience of a few
experts around the world, is of pivotal importance in taxonomic research and electronic access via web-based
resources is increasingly becoming the most efficient way
to find and retrieve these articles. Unfortunately, the current version of the ICZN code makes life needlessly complex for online journals that publish species descriptions
(such as BMC Biology, BMC Evolutionary Biology and Fron-

tiers in Zoology) by requiring the production of printed
copies.
A positive development is a proposed amendment to the
code, which would allow animal species descriptions and
other nomenclatural acts to be published in electronic format, provided a number of conditions are met to ensure
long-term accessibility [6]. Of course, not everything that
is posted on the Internet is assured permanency and it
therefore makes sense that the proposed amendments of
the code insist on some prudent criteria. For example,
copies of the PDF files of published articles should be
deposited in a number of repositories that are independent of the publisher (something which is already the case
for all BioMed Central articles). A separate proposal is that
the validity of new species names might be determined
not by print or electronic publication, but by the registration of the name with an official registry, Zoobank [7],
which already exists in experimental form. Upon registration, each new species would get a unique Life Science
Identifier (LSID), which would provide a standard reference analogous to the GenBank accession number
assigned to new DNA sequences.

The community of zoological taxonomists is now discussing these suggestions and a variety of views and commentary regarding the merits of electronic publication and
open access for species descriptions have been recently
published in an issue of the Bulletin of Zoological
Nomenclature [8]. BioMed Central has been an active participant in this debate, and looks forward eagerly to the
next update to the ICZN code.
Finally, although the issue of long-term availability of
electronic publications is distinct from that of Open
Access, it is hard to see how a cross-linked, integrated network of online biodiversity resources can achieve its full
potential if access to key primary sources, such as species
descriptions, is restricted. It is therefore unsurprising that
many leading researchers in the new fields of cybertaxonomy and biodiversity informatics are passionate supporters of Open Access publishing. In a recent article in BMC
Research Notes, Donat Agosti and Willi Egloff describe an
exciting approach to improve access to taxonomic information by providing 'semantically enhanced' documents
that are machine-readable and that are openly shared and
cross-linked to other resources [9]. At BioMed Central, we
are doing all we can to encourage and facilitate these new
developments, as evidenced by our involvement in the
recently launched GBIF Task Group on a Data Publishing
Framework [10] and we continue to work closely with our
authors, referees, and Editorial Boards to develop publishing services that meet the needs of researchers working on
biodiversity and taxonomy.
