Evolution of the rpoB-psbZ region in fern plastid
genomes: notable structural rearrangements and
highly variable intergenic spacers
Lei Gao1, Yuan Zhou1, Zhi-Wei Wang1, Ying-Juan Su2* and Ting Wang1*

Abstract
Background: The rpoB-psbZ (BZ) region of some fern plastid genomes (plastomes) has been noted to go through
considerable genomic changes. Unraveling its evolutionary dynamics across all fern lineages will lead to clarify the
fundamental process shaping fern plastome structure and organization.
Results: A total of 24 fern BZ sequences were investigated with taxon sampling covering all the extant fern orders.
We found that: (i) a tree fern Plagiogyria japonica contained a novel gene order that can be generated from either
the ancestral Angiopteris type or the derived Adiantum type via a single inversion; (ii) the trnY-trnE intergenic spacer
(IGS) of the filmy fern Vandenboschia radicans was expanded 3-fold due to the tandem 27-bp repeats which
showed strong sequence similarity with the anticodon domain of trnY; (iii) the trnY-trnE IGSs of two horsetail ferns
Equisetum ramosissimum and E. arvense underwent an unprecedented 5-kb long expansion, more than a quarter of
which was consisted of a single type of direct repeats also relevant to the trnY anticodon domain; and (iv) ycf66
has independently lost at least four times in ferns.
Conclusions: Our results provided fresh insights into the evolutionary process of fern BZ regions. The intermediate BZ
gene order was not detected, supporting that the Adiantum type was generated by two inversions occurring in pairs.
The occurrence of Vandenboschia 27-bp repeats represents the first evidence of partial tRNA gene duplication in fern
plastomes. Repeats potentially forming a stem-loop structure play major roles in the expansion of the trnY-trnE IGS.

Background
In contrast to nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, plant
plastid (chloroplast) genomes (plastomes) are generally
conserved in genome size, gene content and gene order
[1-3]. This high conservation makes the plastid genes and
genomes quite amenable for sequencing and be widely
used in evolutionary and phylogenetic studies. Nevertheless, comparative genomics studies demonstrate that the
plastomes of several vascular plant lineages such as lycophytes (Selaginellaceae) [4,5], gymnosperms (e.g. Pinaceae
[6-8], Cupressaceae [9], Welwitschiaceae [7,10], Gnetaceae
and Ephedraceae [7]) and various eudicot angiosperm
lineages (e.g. Geraniaceae [2,11], Campanulaceae [12,13]

and Fabaceae [14,15]), have experienced remarkable genomic changes including significant size variations, complex
rearrangements as well as substantial gene losses. Many
reports have shown that highly rearranged plastomes
usually contain a large number of repetitive elements
[2,11,12,16]. Furthermore, the distribution of the repeats
also exhibits a tendency to flank the rearrangement endpoints, implying an association between the repeat and the
rearrangement [2,9,11,12,16-18]. Recently, Maréchal and
Brisson [19] specified that the suppression of recombination between repeats is of importance in the maintenance
of plastome stability. Nevertheless, besides rearrangement
endpoints, abundant repeats are also found in other
regions of plastomes. For instance, extensive dispersed
repeats have been found throughout the algae plastome of
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [20], and many direct repeats
derived from partial duplication of their nearby trnY-GUA
gene have been observed in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) [21]. These findings highlight the structural and

functional significances of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA)
repeats. In Chlamydomonas plastomes, it has been shown
that small dispersed repeats can influence both transcript
stability and translation efficiency [22] or even function in
DNA repair [23]. Previous studies, particularly those on
the complete plastome sequences, have well documented
the characteristics and distribution of cpDNA repeats
[2,9,11,12,16,20,24,25]. However, very few investigations
deal with the implications of the secondary structure of
cpDNA repetitive elements on their origin, proliferation
and potential function [26]. Delineating the secondary
structural features should greatly facilitate our understanding of plastome evolution.
A number of comparative chloroplast genomic studies
have uncovered structural mutations in fern (monilophyte)
cpDNAs, including as many as 6 inversions and a few gene
losses [24,27-32]. Specifically, one ~3.3 kb inversion (involving trnG-GCC to trnT-GGU) [27] and an inverted trnDGUC gene (D inversion) [24] have been detected across
ferns relative to other land plants. According to gene
orders, the fern plastomes can be classified into two main
types. One comprises the plastomes of taxa diversifying
before the separation of the Schizaeales, which share the
ancestral gene order and has been assumed to undergo no
major rearrangements [33]. By contrast, the other composes the plastomes of core leptosporangiates possessing
the derived gene order [33]. This derived gene order is
characteristic of highly rearranged inverted repeats (IRs)
with the rRNA genes arranged in reverse order in comparison to all other plants [34]. The rearranged IRs and their
adjacent section of large single copy (LSC) region are
thought to be generated by two partially overlapping
inversions spanning LSC and IR regions [35]. Wolf et al.
[33] recently illustrated that the two putative inversions
occurred in pairs on the branch leading to the common
ancestor of schizaeoid and core leptosporangiate ferns.
The next striking difference between the ancestral and
derived gene order is occurred between the rpoB and psbZ
(BZ) in LSC region (Figure 1a). BZ region is characterized
with a high degree of variability. Each of the three key
inversions shaping the ancestral gene order of ferns, i.e. the
30-kb inversion [36], the 3.3-kb inversion [27] and the D
inversion [24] , have at least one of their endpoints located
within BZ region. Notably, up to five tRNA genes are concentrated in this small region after the three inversions
(Figure 1a). This uncommonly high frequency of tRNA
genes may be relative with the instability of BZ region.
Roper et al. [28] suggested that the gene order changes
within BZ region (hereafter the BZ rearrangement) of ferns
can also be derived from two partially overlapping inversions by either of the two potential pathways (Figure 1a).
Nonetheless, since all the investigated core leptosporangiates possess the derived BZ order (the same as Adiantum
type gene order) (Figure 1a) and no intermediate has been

Page 2 of 13

identified in any ferns, it has been argued that the two
hypothetical inversions should take place in pairs in the
common ancestor of core leptosporangiates [33]. Unfortunately, the previous studies have only examined four complete (3 polypods and 1 tree fern) [24,27,30,32] and six
partial plastome sequences from the leptosporangiates [33].
If more samples are examined, the putative intermediates
may be uncovered.
In this study, we mainly investigated the evolutionary
process of BZ region and its sequence components in
ferns. Twenty-four fern BZ sequences were studied guided
by the recently published phylogenetic framework [37],
with a focus on leptosporangiates. Firstly, a novel gene
order was detected in the tree fern Plagiogyria japonica,
which may represent the intermediate of BZ rearrangement or the reverse mutant of the Adiantum type. Secondly, a unique 459-bp region, consisting of 17 tandem
27-bp repeats derived from the partial duplication of the
adjacent trnY gene, was found to cause the trnE-trnY
intergenic spacer (IGS) of the filmy fern Vandenboschia
radicans to expand approximately 3-fold in length. To our
knowledge this is the first report of partially duplicated
tRNA gene in fern plastomes. Thirdly, unexpected 5-kb
long trnE-trnY IGSs were observed in two horsetail ferns
Equisetum ramosissimum and E. arvense. More than a
quarter of the IGSs was comprised of a single type of
direct repeats possessing the potential to form a highly
conserved stem-loop structure. The direct repeats may
have a recent evolutionary origin, frequently conduct copy
corrections, and are of significant functional relevance.
And fourthly, the occurrence of ycf66 was confirmed
highly unstable in ferns with at least 4 times of independent losses.

Methods
DNA amplification and sequencing

Up to date, seven complete plastome sequences of ferns
have been deposited in GenBank, whose data can be
directly extracted. Besides these, additional 17 sampling
taxa were chosen based on the previously published phylogenetic framework of extant ferns [37] to represent all
major lineages at the order level (Table 1). Young leaves of
the 17 fern species were collected from Wuhan Botanical
Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), South
China Botanical Garden, CAS, and Shenzhen Fairy Lake
Botanical Garden. Voucher specimens were deposited at
the herbarium of Wuhan Botanical Garden, CAS. Total
DNA isolation, primer design, polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) and DNA sequencing were as previously described
[24].
To obtain the sequences from rpoB to psbZ, the conserved flanking regions, partial sequence of rpoB gene
and GpsbC (psbC to trnG) block (Figure 1a) were amplified, cloned into plasmid vectors (pCR2.1, Invitrogen,

Carlsbad, CA) and transformed into E. coli DH5a. At
least three clones for each PCR product were randomly
selected and commercially sequenced from both ends
using ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
Species-specific primers were then designed based on
the flanking sequences and long-range PCR was performed to amplify rpoB-psbZ region (Figure 1b, Strategy
I). The desired band was gel-purified, sequenced from
both ends, and then determined the remains by primer
walking. To avoid the potential error from PCR and
sequencing, each PCR fragment was independently
sequenced twice. If they had differences, additional
sequencings were performed.
For some samples, whose BZ sequences were unable
to be completely acquired by primer walking sequencing
of PCR products because of repeats and/or complex secondary structures, a two-step approach was applied

(Figure 1b, Strategy II): first, the regions of CNM (trnCpetN-psbM) and DYE (trnD-trnY-trnE) gene blocks were
amplified, cloned and sequenced; second, species-specific primers were designed based on the CNM and DYE
sequences coupled with the primers from the rpoB gene
and GpsbC region to amplify the remained sections. At
least three clones for each PCR product were sequenced.
The overlapping regions of each pair of adjacent PCR
fragments exceeded 150 bp.
The sequences generated in this paper have been
deposited in GenBank (accession numbers: HQ658094HQ658110) (Table 1).
Sequence assembly and annotation

The individual reads were cleaned by removing vector,
primer and low-quality sequences, then assembled using
CAP [38] through BioEdit [39]. The assembled sequences

were annotated by DOGMA (Dual Organellar GenoMe
Annotator) [40]. Start and stop codons were defined
through comparison to published complete plastome
sequences available in GenBank. To detect tRNA genes,
two online programs were employed, ARAGORN v1.2
[41] and tRNAscan-SE v.1.21 [42]. The putative promoters were identified by running BPROM [43].
Repeat sequence analyses

The sequences were initially scanned with REPuter [44] at
a repeat length ≥ 20 bp with a Hamming distance of 3. Forward (direct), reverse, complement and reverse complement repeats were all recognized under REPuter. Repeated
sequences were unusually abundant in E. ramosissimum
and E. arvense. For them, repeats were further identified
and classified by the VMATCH software package [45]. For
each sequence, an index was constructed using MKVTREE
program with the -dna -pl -allout and -v options. Direct
repeats ≥ 20 bp were identified using VMATCH and then
divided into distinct families with MATCHCLUSTER by
allowing 15% sequence dissimilarity (-erate option set to
15). The sequences of each family were extracted with
VMATCHSELECT. Like REPuter, the VMATCH identifies
all overlapping repeats and thus overestimates the number

of repetitive elements in a given sequence. To avoid this
issue, the redundant overlapping repeats were masked. The
consensus for each family was then generated from a
CLUSTAL X [46] alignment.
The secondary structures of repeated sequences were
predicted by Mfold web server [47] with default parameters. Most of the repeats found in horsetails have a
stem-loop structure with a 7-nt loop. Then, we designed
a Perl script (available on request) to detect the
sequence fragments which have the following stem-loop
structure characteristics: loop length = 7 and stem
length ≥3. The identified stem-loop sequences were
assigned to distinct families according to their stem
sequences afterwards.
Phylogenetic analyses

A total of 5 protein-coding (petN, psbC, psbM, psbZ,
rpoB) and 6 tRNA gene (trnC-GCA, trnD-GUC, trnEUUC, trnG-GCC, trnS-UGA, trnY-GUA) sequences were
extracted from 17 new generated fern plastid sequences
from psbC to rpoB in this study (Figure 1). The coding
sequences of these 11 genes were also acquired from
the completed plastomes of 6 ferns, i.e. Adiantum capillus-veneris, Alsophila spinulosa, Angiopteris evecta,

Gao et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:64

Cheilanthes lindheimeri, Psilotum nudum and Pteridium
aquilinum, as well as 2 seed plant outgroups, i.e.
Amborella trichopoda (NC_005086) and Cycas taitungensis (NC_009618), according to their annotations in
GenBank. The nucleotide sequences of each tRNA gene
were aligned in MUSCLE [48] with manual inspection.
For protein-coding genes, nucleotide sequences for each
gene were translated into amino acids, aligned in MUSCLE [48]. Nucleotide sequences were aligned by constraining them to the amino acid sequence alignment
followed by manual adjustments. A Nexus file comprising 5,525 characters was generated after alignment was
completed.
Phylogenetic analyses were performed using maximum
likelihood (ML) (GARLI v1.0.699) [49] and Bayesian
inference (BI) (MrBayes v3.1.2) [50]. The most appropriate model (GTR+I+G) of nucleotide evolution was
determined by using the Akaike Information Criterion
via Modeltest 3.7 [51]. For ML, three independent runs
were conducted in GARLI, using default parameters
except that automated stopping criterion set at 20,000
generations (genthreshfortopoterm = 20000). A total of
1,000 ML Bootstrap (BS) replicates was also performed
using GARLI. Likelihood scores were calculated by
using PAUP v4.10 [52]. For BI, each run started with a
random tree, default priors and four Markov chains, and
were sampled every 100 generations. Three independent
analyses were run for 1 × 10 7 , 1.5 × 10 7 and 2 × 10 7
generations. Convergence was confirmed by Tracer 1.5
[53]. Twenty-five percent of burn-in trees were
discarded.

Results and Discussion
The process of rpoB-psbZ rearrangement

Two putative pathways have been proposed for describing the evolutionary process of the complex gene order
change between rpoB and psbZ through fern evolution
(Figure 1a) [28]. However, no direct evidence is provided for either of them. Figure 2 shows the BZ gene
order in 24 samples representing all the 11 extant fern
orders (Table 1) [following reference 37]. Two blocks of
genes, CNM (trnC-petN-psbM) and DYE (trnD-trnYtrnE), are found to be conserved across ferns. Nearly all
core leptosporangiates excluding Plagiogyria japonica
have the same gene arrangement pattern as that
observed in Adiantum capillus-veneris [27] (hereafter
the Adiantum type). By contrast, all basal ferns and
early branches of leptosporangiates share the gene order
previously found in Angiopteris evecta [28] (hereafter
the Angiopteris type). Unlike other core leptosporangiates, the tree fern P. japonica (Plagiogyriaceae) does not
present the Adiantum type order. Instead its gene order
(hereafter the Plagiogyria type) seems to derive from the

Page 5 of 13

Angiopteris type via a large inversion spanning from
trnC-GCA to trnE-UUC ("CE inversion” in Figure 2) or
from the Adiantum type through a small inversion only
involving the DYE block ("DE inversion” in Figure 2).
The Plagiogyria type order seemingly represents the
intermediate of BZ rearrangement. If this hypothesis is
true, we might speculate that the Adiantum type is formed
through two serial inversions, first the large CE inversion
and then the small DE inversion (as shown in Figure 2).
For the CE inversion, the most parsimonious explanation
is that it occurred only once and on the common ancestor
of core leptosporangiates (Figure 3a), because the Adiantum type has been observed in all the three core leptosporangiate lineages. The next question is at which
evolutionary stage the DE inversion event occurred?
Recent studies have identified Plagiogyriaceae as a lineage
of tree ferns [54-61]. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that
the Adiantum type found in tree ferns directly arose from
the Plagiogyria type. As for the Adiantum type in other
core leptosporangiate ferns, intuitively it is also intended
to infer that this order was derived from the Plagiogyria
type. However, current knowledge of the phylogenetic
positions of both Plagiogyriaceae and tree ferns make the
speculation implausible. Molecular phylogenetic analyses
have shown that tree ferns are the sister group of polypods, and then the two groups jointly compose the sister
group to heterosporous ferns (Figure 2, Additional file 1)
[56,58,59,61-65]. If it is presumed that the Adiantum type
observed in heterosporous and polypod ferns originated
directly from the Plagiogyria type, there should exist
unknown polypod and heterosporous fern species that
possess the same intermediate gene order as that of Plagiogyria. In other words, once the Plagiogyria type is
hypothesized to be the intermediate form of the BZ rearrangement, the putative DE inversion would have had to
independently occur at least three times (each in the three
core leptosporangiate lineages, respectively) to transit the
Plagiogyria type into the Adiantum type (Figure 3a).
Therefore, taking the Plagiogyria type as the intermediate
form actually becomes a very unlikely pathway for establishing the derived BZ gene type.
An alternative interpretation is that the Plagiogyria
type merely represents a derivative of the Adiantum type
via a reverse DE inversion (Figure 3b). As shown in figure
2, the DYE block is quite short, merely ~300-500 bp in
most leptosporangiates. Since it is well recognized that
the small-scale inversion is highly prone to reversal and
parallelism [66], and the high degree of rearrangements
is often associated with tRNA genes [12], here we would
propose that the occurrence of the reverse DE inversion
should be of great possibility. If this is indeed the case,
then the exact process of the alteration of Angiopteris
type to Adiantum type remains an open question.

trnD-GUC inversion

Three consecutive tRNA genes, trnD-GUC, trnY-GUA
and trnE-UUC, are embedded in the BZ region. In seed
plants, they have been shown to constitute an operon
(trnE operon) whose transcript is processed to produce
individual tRNA molecules [67]. Nevertheless, in our previous report, the trnD gene was found to have an opposite transcriptional direction relative to trnY and trnE in

ferns based on the four completely sequenced fern plastome data available at that time [24]. With the newly
determined sequences here, our previous speculation
that the minor D inversion is shared by all fern lineages
was further corroborated. Since the trnD is inverted, it is
reasonable to assume that this gene is unable to be cotranscripted with trnY and trnE. In addition, the conserved “-35 box” and “-10 box” promoter sequences were

also found upstream of the trnD gene in all the studied
ferns (Additional file 2), further supporting that the transcription of the inverted trnD gene is independent of the
trnE operon.
Intergenic spacers

Sizes of the sequences between rpoB and psbZ are
highly variable in ferns, ranging from 2,744 bp in Psilotum nudum to 7,546 bp in E. ramosissimum. The size
variability is directly linked to the size of IGS, since
both gene content and length are highly conserved in
the BZ region (Figure 2).
The IGS of trnY-trnE

The sizes of trnY-trnE IGS (YE-IGS) are largely conservative in ferns, most of them ranging from 95 to 179 bp
(Figure 2). The smallest YE-IGS, merely 16 bp, is
detected in Platycerium wallichii (a polypod fern). In
stark contrast, one filmy fern and two horsetails have
experienced dramatic expansion of this region, reaching
as long as 619 bp, 4,872 bp and 5,000 bp in Vandenboschia radicans, E. arvense (our sequence, hereafter
E. arvense 1) and E. ramosissimum, respectively. The
unusual 5-kb long YE-IGS of E. arvense was also noted
in the recently published report documenting its complete plastome sequence [[31], hereafter E. arvense 2].
The unexpected large IGS leads us directly to the question of how the region is organized and where its component module originates from.
As for V. radicans YE-IGS, a total of 17 tandem 27-bp
quasi-identical repeats were found, falling into three
modules (Figure 4a). The first contains five 27-bp repeats,
while the other two each include six 27-bp repeats
(Figure 4b). Interestingly, the two 6 × 27 modules are
identical: both are composed of one distantly homologous 27-bp head upstream of five nearly identical 27-bp
segments (there is only a single base pair difference
among the five repeats) (Figure 4b). We noticed that the
sequences of the 27-bp repeats resemble a 25-bp section

of the trnY gene (Figure 4b,c), corresponding to the
entire anticodon arm and the stem of the D arm. Similarly, the duplications of this trnY region were also characterized in Douglas-fir [21]. To our knowledge, this
partial tRNA gene duplication has not been reported in
ferns before. Like the trnY anticodon arm, the 27-bp
repetitive elements also possess the potential to fold a
similar stem-loop structure. The independent occurrences of the partial trnY duplications in filmy fern as
well as Douglas-fir imply that the anticodon domain
sequence of trnY has a tendency to duplicate and proliferate, possibly relative to its stem-loop secondary
structure.
The VMATCH software package was used to identify
and classify the dispersed repeats in Equisetum. A total
of 85 (82 direct and 3 palindromic) and 441 (440 direct
and 1 palindromic) matches ≥ 20 bp were detected in
the BZ sequences of E. ramosissimum and E. arvense 1,
respectively. All the direct matches but one from
E. ramosissimum resides in the YE-IGS. To affirm the
existence of this large number of repeats in E. arvense,
the E. arvense 2 plastome sequence was also analyzed by
using VMATCH. 560 direct and 20 palindromic
matches were recognized, of which 548 direct matches
located in the YE-IGS. The YE-IGS thus far becomes
the most repeat-rich region found in the E. arvense
plastome.
After filtering the overlapping repeats, 54 and 84 nonredundant direct repeats were identified in the YE-IGS of
E. ramosissimum and E. arvense 1, respectively. Based on
sequence similarity, the repeats fell into 16-18 families
(Table 2). Their secondary structures were then predicted
by using Mfold web server [47] (Additional file 3-4).
Remarkably, most of the repeats, 45 out of 54 in E. ramosissimum and 76 of 84 in E. arvense 1, were shown to
have the potential to fold into similar stem-loop structures with a 7-nt A-rich loop and various length stem.
These stem-loop repeats produce a consensus mark of

three successive adenine nucleotides ("AAA”) proximate
to the stem (Additional file 3-4). Their total sizes are
1,154 and 2,014 bp in E. ramosissimum and E. arvense 1
sequence, respectively. The uncommon abundance of the
repeats implies that they may correlate to the unexpected
expansion of the huge YE-IGS in Equisetum.
In order to test the correlation between the proliferation of the stem-loop sequences and the expansion of
YE-IGS, we composed a Perl script to ascertain the exact
amount and the distribution of the stem-loop repeats
(parameters: loop size = 7, stem length ≥ 3). 90, 96 and
102 hits representing the putative stem-loop structure
were identified in the YE-IGS of E. ramosissimum, E.
arvense 1 and 2 sequences, respectively. The majority of
them, namely 68 in E. ramosissimum, 78 in E. arvense 1
and 82 in E. arvense 2 sequence (Table 3), possess the
sequential “AAA” immediate to the stem (Figure 5b).
The stem lengths of these A-rich stem-loop elements
range from 3 to 13 bp (Table 3). It is worthy to note that
the total lengths of the repeats appropriate more than
one quarter of the Equisetum YE-IGS, i.e. 25.72%, 28.57%
and 28.65% in E. ramosissimum, E. arvense 1 and 2,

respectively. In addition, the distribution of the stemloop repeats is not restricted in a given small region but
throughout the entire YE-IGS (Figure 5a). Our results
suggest that the proliferation of the stem-loop repeats is
directly correlated to the expansion of the YE-IGS in
Equisetum.
The stem-loop sequences fell into 2-4 families according
to the first three stem base pairs proximate to the loop
(Figure 5b). The most abundant is the GGA/TCC family,
which may represent the prototype of the other families.
The conserved GGA/TCC stem, 7-nt loop and “AAA” signature push us to postulate that the stem-loop elements
may derive from tRNA anticodon arm, because the latter
often possess the same stem-loop characteristics. The
complete E. arvense plastome sequence data shows that at
least 4 tRNAs, i.e. trnC-GCA, trnF-GAA, trnL-UAA and
trnY-GUA (Figure 5c), exhibit the GGA/UCC stem core,
the 7-nt loop and the “AAA” signature on their anticodon
regions. Of them, the trnY locus is exactly neighbor to the
repeat region (Figure 5a). Occurrences of trnY-anticodonarm-related repeats that are close to trnY gene have also
been documented in Douglas-fir [21] as well as the

aforementioned Vandenboschia (Figure 4). Taken the
information together, we suggest that the trnY-GUA gene
is possibly the origin of the stem-loop repeats, although
other alternatives cannot be definitively ruled out. In contrast to the sizes and the primary sequences, the stemloop structures of the repeats appear to be highly
conservative.
The “-35 box” and “-10 box” promoter sequences were
predicted upstream of trnY in Vandenboschia and Equisetum (Figure 4a, 5a), implying that the long YE-IGS may
function in regulating the trnY transcription. The highly

conserved stem-loop structure detected among the Vandenboschia and Equisetum repeats suggests that the
repeats should potentially have a recent evolutionary origin, frequent copy corrections, and certain functional
roles. Stem-loop structures have commonly been
observed in the plastome IGS regions [66,68-70]. Their
loop regions are often associated with hot spots for mutations, while the stem-forming sequences frequently being
conserved [66]. Most plastid transcripts potentially form
stem-loops in their 5’ untranslated regions (5’-UTRs) and
3’-UTRs [71-73], which are thought to function in

mRNA maturation, accumulation, and translation
[22,71-76]. The dramatic proliferation of stem-loop
repeats in the Vandenboschia and Equisetum plastomes
provides a trigger for their neofunctionalization. For
instance, the repeats might involve in the transcriptional

and/or post-transcriptional regulation of the neighbor
trnY gene.
The IGS of psbM-petN and the occurrence of ycf66

The other highly variable IGS is located between psbM
and petN genes (MN-IGS) (Figure 2). The longest MNIGS (1,788 bp), found in Plagiogyria adnata, is about
8 times longer than the shortest in Psilotum nudum
(204 bp). Previous researches documented an open reading frame (ORF) designated ycf66 in the MN-IGS of
Angiopteris evecta [28] and a pseudogenized ycf66 copy in
both of Alsophila spinulosa [24] and Equisetum arvense
[31]. Here we further identified a complete ycf66 in Botrychium virginianum (Ophioglossaceae) and all sampled
“non-core” leptosporangiates (Osmundales, Hymenophyllales, Gleicheniales and Schizaeales) (Figure 2). ycf66
appears to be pseudogenized in Helminthostachys zeylanica (Ophioglossaceae), Equisetum, and tree ferns (Figure
2). By contrast, it was undetectable in Ophioglossum vulgatum (Ophioglossaceae), Psilotum, and polypods. Hence
ycf66 may have been independently lost at least four times
in fern lineages Ophioglossales, Psilotales, Equisetales, and

core leptosporangiates. Generally, the MN-IGS containing
no ycf66 is shorter than that carrying ycf66 or its pseudogene (Figure 2). For instance, of the three Ophioglossaceous ferns, the MN-IGS sizes of Botrychium (1,393 bp,
containing intact ycf66) and Helminthostachys (1,324 bp,
containing ycf66 pseudogene) are one time longer that of
Ophioglossum (628 bp, containing no ycf66) (Figure 2).
The highly unstable occurrence of ycf66 suggests that it
seems unessential for the fern plastid function, or it has
been transferred to nuclear genome.

Conclusions
The tRNA-rich BZ region of fern plastomes exhibited considerable variation in size, gene order, and repeat content.
Here a novel BZ gene order was identified in the tree fern
Plagiogyria japonica. Our comparative analysis subsequently showed that the plastomes of extant fern lineages
may not contain the putative intermediates of BZ rearrangement, pointing to the conclusion that the Adiantum
gene order was generated by two inversions occurring in
pairs [33]. The trnY-trnE IGS in the filmy fern Vandenboschia radicans was expanded substantially due to the
tandem 27-bp repeats resembling the anticodon domain
of trnY. This result provided the first evidence of partial
tRNA gene duplication in fern plastomes. In general, the
detection of slight length variation in chloroplast IGS
region is not uncommon [e.g. [7,10,11,20]]. Nevertheless,
it is unprecedented that the Equisetum trnY-trnE IGSs
were found to undergo an expansion as large as 5-kb.
These IGS sequences were consisted of a large amount of
stem-loop repeats, which may also have an evolutionary
link to the trnY anticodon domain. In addition, the parallel
losses of ycf66 in ferns were corroborated.
