Background

Conclusion

A major characteristic of HIV-1 is its broad genetic diversity, which has significance for HIV transmission, treatment, diagnosis and prevention. We examined the genetic
diversity of HIV in blood donors in Cameroon to understand the virus genotype distribution in this population.

Our study confirmed the existence of high number of
cocirculating HIV-1 subtypes, the high intrasubtype diversity, and the high numbers of possible new recombinant
viruses in urban Cameroon. These results highlight the
epidemiologic importance of HIV-1 CRFs, especially
CRF02_AG.

Methods
A total of 88 HIV-1 positive samples, collected from blood
donors in urban Cameroon in 2002, were genetically
characterized in part of HIV-1 env (gp41) and gag (p17)
regions through phylogenetic analysis.

Results
All the samples were infected with HIV-1 group M. No
group N and O viruses were identified in the samples
studied although they are endemic to Cameroon. HIV-1
infections were dominated by circulating recombinant
form CRF02_AG (59%) accompanied by additional
group M subtypes or CRFs: A, D, F2, G, CRF01_AE,
CRF13_cpx and CRF22_01A1. A high percentage (26%)
of the samples had discordant subtype designations
between gag and env, and appear to be unique intersubtype recombinant forms (URF) with the majority (91%)
involving recombination with either CRF01_AE or/and
CRF02_AG. URFs containing CRF19 or CRF22 as well
Fgag-Genv and Cgag-Aenv are reported. Some samples
were not consistently detected by current HIV-1 testing
assays.
