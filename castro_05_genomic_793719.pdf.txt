Abstract
Background: The cytochrome P450 aromatase (CYP19), catalyses the aromatisation of androgens
to estrogens, a key mechanism in vertebrate reproductive physiology. A current evolutionary
hypothesis suggests that CYP19 gene arose at the origin of vertebrates, given that it has not been
found outside this clade. The human CYP19 gene is located in one of the proposed MHC-paralogon
regions (HSA15q). At present it is unclear whether this genomic location is ancestral (which would
suggest an invertebrate origin for CYP19) or derived (genomic location with no evolutionary
meaning). The distinction between these possibilities should help to clarify the timing of the CYP19
emergence and which taxa should be investigated.
Results: Here we determine the "genomic environment" around CYP19 in three vertebrate
species Homo sapiens, Tetraodon nigroviridis and Xenopus tropicalis. Paralogy studies and phylogenetic
analysis of six gene families suggests that the CYP19 gene region was structured through "en bloc"
genomic duplication (as part of the MHC-paralogon formation). Four gene families have specifically
duplicated in the vertebrate lineage. Moreover, the mapping location of the different paralogues is
consistent with a model of "en bloc" duplication. Furthermore, we also determine that this region
has retained the same gene content since the divergence of Actinopterygii and Tetrapods. A single
inversion in gene order has taken place, probably in the mammalian lineage. Finally, we describe the
first invertebrate CYP19 sequence, from Branchiostoma floridae.
Conclusion: Contrary to previous suggestions, our data indicates an invertebrate origin for the
aromatase gene, given the striking conservation pattern in both gene order and gene content, and
the presence of aromatase in amphioxus. We propose that CYP19 duplicated in the vertebrate
lineage to yield four paralogues, followed by the subsequent loss of all but one gene in vertebrate
evolution. Finally, we suggest that agnathans and lophotrocozoan protostomes should be
investigated for the presence of aromatase.

Background
The cytochrome P450 aromatase (CYP19) is a member of
a large superfamily of enzymes named cytochrome P450,
which are involved in many physiological functions, such

as steroid biosynthesis [1]. CYP19 is a steroidogenic
enzyme which catalyses the aromatisation of androgens
to estrogens. Thus, aromatase activity is essential for
maintaining a physiological balance between androgens

and estrogens, a critical aspect in the reproductive function of vertebrates; in humans, a P450 aromatase mutation leads to sterility [2]. For many other vertebrate
groups, it as been demonstrated that CYP19 plays a key
role in sex differentiation [3].
While several CYP450 genes are universally distributed,
CYP19 is so far restricted to the vertebrate lineage. In
mammals [4], birds [5], amphibians [6], reptiles [7] and
cartilaginous fishes [8], a single gene has been isolated. In
most Actinopterygii, however, two genes, Cyp19a and
Cyp19b, encode two different transcripts expressed in the
ovary and brain respectively [9]. Linkage data from
zebrafish clearly suggests that these two genes are most
likely the result of a genome duplication in the ray-finned
bony fish lineage [9]. Despite intensive research, the
ancestry of CYP19 genes is yet to be deciphered. No orthologue has been described from fully sequenced invertebrate genomes, like Drosophila melanogaster, Ciona
intestinalis or Caenorhabditis elegans [10]. Thus, it has been
suggested that the CYP19 gene arose at the origin of vertebrates [10,11]. Nevertheless, there is now strong evidence
indicating that these model invertebrate species have
experienced extensive gene loss [12]. Significantly, the
estrogen receptor which was thought to have emerged in
vertebrate ancestry, has now been documented in the
lophotrocozoan protostome Aplysia californica [13].
Paralogy regions (or paralogons) consist of a series of
linked genes (unrelated) on one chromosome, many of
which have linked homologues (or paralogues) on at least
another chromosome (typically four) [14,15]. Two main
scenarios have been put forward to account for their presence: evolutionary remnants of chromosomal "en bloc"
duplications or genome duplication, followed by gene
loss and inversions [16,17]; or they reflect independent
tandem duplications of each gene family followed by
adaptive groupings of genes on different chromosomes
[18]. The term "en bloc" duplication is used here in the
context described by Abi-Rached et al. [17]. One of the
best characterised examples of a paralogon includes the
genes around the MHC complex on human chromosome
6, with homologues on chromosomes 1, 9, 5, 15 and 19
[19,20] (figure 1). Despite other views [18], the most
recent findings indicate that an ancestral MHC-like
region/chromosome duplicated "en bloc" twice in early
vertebrate ancestry to yield a four-array paralogon (figure
1) [17,19-22]. Accordingly, vertebrate genes within these
regions should have multiple copies (up to four) equally
related to single invertebrate orthologues [23]. However,
this is not the case for a substantial proportion of gene
families. Gene loss, genomic rearrangements and insertions in both vertebrate and invertebrate genomes will
obscure the correct evolutionary pattern of gene families
within paralogons [23]. This is particularly evident for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/43

gene families which are vertebrate single copy. If a vertebrate one-member gene family maps to a paralogon and
no orthologue is found in invertebrate model species
what should we conclude regarding the ancestry of such a
gene family? The human CYP19 gene follows this pattern.
It maps to HSA15q, a region proposed to be part of the
MHC-paralogon [20] (figure 1). This genomic location is
highly suggestive for a invertebrate origin of CYP19. Nevertheless, since no paralogues are found in other chromosomal regions, it could well be the case of a genomic
location with no evolutionary meaning.
Phylogenetics, paralogy and comparative genomics can be
a particularly powerful tool to address issues of gene
ancestry. Here, we analysed the evolutionary history of the
genes in close physical proximity to the aromatase gene(s)
in several vertebrate species (Homo sapiens, Tetraodon
nigroviridis and Xenopus tropicalis). Through phylogenetic
analysis we demonstrate that the CYP19 region was structured most likely by "en bloc" genomic duplication (as
part of the MHC-paralogon). Most importantly, we also
determine that this region has retained the same gene content and overall organisation (CYP19 included) without
any gene insertion in the three lineages. A single inversion
of gene order has occurred in the mammalian clade.
Finally, we describe for the first time an invertebrate
CYP19 partial sequence from Branchiostoma floridae. We
propose that the aromatase gene family is much older
than previously hinted.

Results and discussion
In this study, we sequentially addressed three questions.
First, we determined the duplication pattern (pre or post
vertebrate radiation) of the gene families in close proximity to the human CYP19. A further test analysed the ancestry of the human aromatase genomic location (ancestral
versus derived). Finally, we investigated the presence of
CYP19 in other invertebrate species (B. floridae), other
than those previously explored.
Phylogeny and paralogy
The human CYP19 maps to one of the proposed MHCparalogon regions (HSA15q) (figure 1) [20]. Despite this
proposal, no phylogenetic analysis has been performed to
confirm that gene families at HSA15q are part of the
MHC-paralogon. This strategy aimed at defining the presence/absence of invertebrate orthologues and the duplication timings of the selected gene families (both these
questions are key predictions of paralogy regions). Therefore, we undertook the task of analysing the "genomic
environment" surrounding the CYP19 human gene at
HSA15q within a DNA sequence of 1.0 Mb (figure 2).
Besides the CYP19, eight other ORFs are annotated within
this DNA sequence, corresponding to the following genes:
AP4E1, FLJ41287, COL, DMXL2, SCGIII, MGC35274,

TMOD2, and TMOD3 (figure 2). This DNA module is outflanked by members of the Tropomodulin gene family,
TMOD2 and TMOD3, which have been proposed to support the vertebrate genome duplication hypothesis [20].
Other members of the TMOD gene family map to
expected regions of MHC paralogy (figure 1). Furthermore, a single orthologue is found in invertebrate species
(e.g. D. melanogaster – sanpodo).
We began by investigating the gene complement for each
gene family in vertebrate and invertebrate species through
BLAST search. Phylogenetic analysis was then performed
when no previous study was available to determine duplication timings (if duplication had occurred).
AP4-E1
Adaptor protein complexes function as vesicle coat components in different membrane traffic pathways [24].
AP4E1 is a recently described subunit of a 4th complex
[24]. Up to the present day the AP4E1 gene has been
found solely in vertebrate genomes. Through BLAST
search we have found the first invertebrate sequence in the
C. intestinalis genome (scaffold 11). As shown in the phy-

logenetic tree, CiAP4E1 is basal to the vertebrate genes
with 1000 of bootstrap support (figure 3A). No further
homologues were uncovered in vertebrate genomes.
SSC-S2
The ORF identified in Ensembl as NP_997264 (FLJ41287
protein), presents significant sequence similarity to three
other GenBank entries. One of those is a novel tumor
necrosis factor-α inducible gene, SSC-S2 [25], which maps
to HSA5. SSC-S2 contains a motif in the amino terminus
that shows a significant similarity to death effector
domain II of cell death regulatory protein, Fas-associated
death domain-like interleukin-1β-converting enzymeinhibitory protein (FLIP) [25]. Through phylogenetic
analysis we showed these four sequences to be paralogues
(figure 3B). The four genes were named as follows: SSCS2A (HSA5), SSC-S2B (HSA1), SSC-S2C (HSA15) and
SSC-S2D (HSA19). Invertebrate orthologues were found
in Anopheles gambiae, D. melanogaster, C. elegans (not used
in the phylogeny) and C. intestinalis (scaffold 92). The
duplication events date to early vertebrate origin, as indicated by the branching pattern of the tree (figure 3B). The
invertebrate sequences are basal to the vertebrate genes

with a significant bootstrap support (figure 3B). No
homologue of SSC-S2A is found in Actinopterygii, possibly due to gene loss. Additionally, the human genes are all
located in regions of MHC paralogy – HSA1, HSA19,
HSA5 and HSA15 (figure 1), as expected from two rounds
of "en bloc" duplication in early vertebrate ancestry. However, the tree branching pattern is not of the (A,B)(C,D)
type, but sequential which is not in agreement with the
"en bloc" scenario.
COL
The Ensembl annotation identifies this gene as Collomin.
This as been renamed to Colmedin (COL1) [26]. Colmedin is a phylogenetically conserved type II transmembrane
protein with collagen repeats and a cysteine-rich olfactomedin domain, with members described in C. elegans
(two genes), Drosophila and vertebrates [26]. No orthologue was detected in C. intestinalis. Colmedin has been
found to be a single-copy gene in several vertebrate species. BLAST search to Danio (not shown), Fugu and Tetraodon genomes uncovered a new Colmedin gene, which we
name COL1b (figure 3C). COL1b is a specific paralogue of
Actinopterygii. The genomic location of this new gene is

explained most likely by an extra genome duplication (see
following section).
DMXL
RAB-3 is a 12 WD domain protein which binds both
GDP/GTP exchange protein and GTPase-activating protein for Rab3 small G protein family [27]. These domains
are found in a variety of proteins and are likely to be
involved in protein-protein interactions [28]. It shows a
domain structure similar to that of DMXL1 which has 10
WD domains, and has been renamed DMXL2 [27,29].
Our phylogenetic analysis confirms that both genes are
paralogues, with invertebrate sequences basal to vertebrate DMXL1 and DMXL2 (figure 3D). Moreover, DMXL1
maps to an expected region of MHC-paralogon in HSA5
(figure 1). Thus, the duplication event which originated
DMXL2 and DMXL1 resulted most likely from two rounds
of "en bloc" duplications in early vertebrate ancestry.
SCGIII
Secretogranin III (SCGIII) is a member of the granin protein family, that is a component of intracellular dense core

vesicles. Through BLAST we found this gene family to be
restricted to vertebrates (not shown).
NM_699205-PPBP
The ORF identified in Ensembl as NM_699205 codes for
the hypothetical protein MGC35274. Sequence features
(Lysin domain) indicate that it might be involved in cell
wall catabolism. The C. elegans orthologue has been
named Predicted peptidoglycan-binding protein (PPBP).
Thus, we named the human gene PPBP1. A second PPBP
gene can be found in vertebrate genomes, which we designate PPBP2. The phylogenetic tree indicates that both
ORFs are paralogues (figure 3E). The second PPBP gene is
present in Fugu (Tetraodon also has a second PPBP gene
but due to the partial sequence was kept out of the phylogeny), amphibians and mammals. The tree pattern indicates that a duplication of an ancestral PPBP gene
occurred specifically in the vertebrate lineage. Moreover,
the second gene maps to an expected region of MHC paralogy in the human genome – HSA1.
TMOD2 and TMOD3
Popovici et al. [20] proposed that the TMOD gene family
duplicated in the vertebrate lineage. However, no phylogenetic analysis was performed to support this assumption. In the human genome 4 tropomodulin genes have
been annotated: TMOD1 (Erythrocyte tropomodulin),
TMOD4 (Skeletal muscle tropomodulin), TMOD2 (Neuronal tropomodulin) and TMOD3 (Ubiquitous tropomodulin). In invertebrates a single tropomodulin gene is
observed. The phylogenetic analysis by Almenar-Queralt
et al. [30] suggests that TMOD1, 2 and 4 duplicated in the
vertebrate lineage. Nevertheless, the origin of TMOD3 is
still unclear. The genomic location of both TMOD2 and 3
is highly suggestive for a tandem duplication. Our phylogenetic analysis, supports this scenario (TMOD2 and 3 are
tandem duplicates from an ancestral TMOD2/3 gene). The
duplication event post-dates the divergence of fish and
amphibians, since a single TMOD2/3 is found in both
Fugu and Tetraodon (figure 3F). On the contrary, Xenopus,
chicken, mouse and human have two distinct genes (mapping side by side) (the Xenopus TMOD3 orthologue has
not been used in the phylogeny). Thus, we propose that a
single tropomodulin gene existed in vertebrate ancestry. It
duplicated to yield three TMOD genes (1, 2/3 and 4) as a
result of "en bloc" duplication (probably as part of
genome duplications). Later, a tandem duplication in the
ancestor of Xenopus, chicken and mammals, originated the
TMOD2 and TMOD3 genes.

The phylogenetic analysis of the full set of gene families
within the human aromatase DNA segment, reveals that
four of those have specifically duplicated in the vertebrate
lineage. Only the SSC-2S gene family shows four paralogues. The tree branching pattern is not of the (A,B)(C,D)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/43

type (expected under an "en bloc" duplication) but
sequential (expected under the adaptive duplication scenario). This observation has been interpreted as evidence
against an "en bloc" scenario [31]. Thus, the phylogeny
(branching patterns) per se does not support the "en bloc"
duplications. In this context, the suggested duplicated
regions could have resulted from a complex duplication,
loss and rearrangement pattern, and not from "en bloc"
duplications [18]. However, Furlong and Holland [23],
have recently disputed this assumption.
Our analysis confirms the previous suggestion by Popovici et al. [20] that genes within HSA15q are part of the
MHC-paralogon. We find that the paralogues for each
gene family map to expected regions of MHC paralogy
(figure 1). That is the case of SSC-2S (4 genes), DMXL (2
genes), PPBP (2 genes) and TMOD (3 genes). The physical
proximity between these genes is also observed in other
regions of paralogy besides HSA15. For example, paralogues SSC-S2B, PPBP2 and TMOD4 map closely in chromosome 1 (200 kb), while DMXL1 and SSC-S2A are
separated by just 300 kb in chromosome 5 (figure 1). Furthermore, of those genes which are found to be single
copy in vertebrates, only for CYP19 and SCGIII we have
not found invertebrate orthologues (either in C.
intestinalis, C. elegans or D. melanogaster).
Comparative genomics
Our phylogenetic analysis and paralogy study strongly
suggests that the DNA segment harbouring the human
aromatase gene resulted from an ancestral "en bloc"
duplication of the MHC-paralogon. However, the question remains regarding the ancestry of human CYP19
genomic location. It could well be case that the human
CYP19 location is of no relevant evolutionary meaning. In
order to explore these possibilities, we compared the gene
content and organisation around CYP19 genes in three
vertebrate species: H. sapiens, T. nigroviridis and X. tropicalis
(figure 2). The comparison indicates a striking pattern of
conservation in both gene content and gene order in the
three species (figure 2). No gene insertion occurred since
the divergence of these lineages. Two genomic events took
place: genomic inversion and tandem gene duplication
(TMOD2, TMOD3). The DNA module containing
TMOD3, TMOD2, PPBP1 and SCGIII is differently located
in both fish/amphibian and humans (boxes figure 2). By
comparing the gene order in the three clades it is possible
to infer the ancestral configuration. Given that both
Tetraodon and Xenopus have an identical gene order, it is
more parsimonious to conclude that the H. sapiens configuration is derived (figure 4). The data indicates that prior
to the divergence of these three lineages the aromatase
gene was already at this precise location (figure 4). In the
case of Tetraodon, this region has duplicated further onto
chromosomes 5 and 13, originating CYP19a and b, most

likely as the result of a further genome duplication on the
teleost lineage (figure 4). Later in evolution, a genomic
inversion has taken place in the human lineage (possible
mammalian) (figure 4).
CYP19 in amphioxus
The phylogenetic analysis, paralogy study and the conservation of gene organisation around aromatase in three
vertebrate species suggest that CYP19 (and the immediate
outliers) was present in the invertebrate unduplicated
MHC-paralogon prior to vertebrate radiation. However,
they do not rule out the possibility that CYP19 emerged
either just before or after the divergence of lamprey/hagfish and gnathostomes (being inserted into the MHC paralogy regions) (arrows-figure 4). The exact timing of the
proposed two rounds of genome duplications which
structure the vertebrate genome is still contentious. However, the consensus points to one duplication prior to the

divergence of lamprey/hagfish and gnathostomes, and the
second after the divergence of these lineages [32] (figure
4). Furthermore, in the genome sequence of the sea squirt
despite the evidence of an MHC unduplicated paralogon
[33], no orthologue of aromatase has been found [10].
On the contrary, amphioxus has proved a more favourable model to address these issues [23]. In order to investigate the presence of CYP19 in B. floridae, a BLAST search
to the trace archives of the Whole Genome Sequence
using the CYP19 sequence from the stingray (Dasyatis
sabina) was performed. A single hit with a significant Evalue was retrieved. This information was subsequently
used to isolate a partial sequence (494 bp) from DNA
extracted from a cDNA 5–24 h embryo library. In figure
5A, we show the DNA sequence and the predicted amino
acid translation. When run on BLAST, it clearly emerges
that it belongs to the CYP19 gene family. We designate
this AmphiCYP19. Vertebrate aromatase genes display

typical putative structural domains. These include the Ihelix region, Ozol's peptide region, Aromatic region and
Heme-binding region [34] (figure 5B). The alignment
provided in figure 5B indicates the presence of similar
motifs in the AmphiCYP19 sequence we now describe. The
orthology of the retrieved sequence was determined
through phylogeny. Overall, this analysis strongly indicates that AmphCYP19 is part of the aromatase evolutionary clade (bootstrap of 1000) (figure 5C). Our result
suggests that that a single CYP19 gene was present at the
base of the chordate lineage. We propose that it has been
independently lost in the urochordate C. intestinalis. We
argue that the ancestral invertebrate chordate CYP19 gene
underwent two rounds of "en bloc" duplication like many
other gene families in the MHC-paralogon to yield four
paralogues. Three of these have been lost. However, we
cannot rule out that no CYP19 duplications occurred in
the vertebrate lineage, regardless of whether "en bloc"
duplications occurred in other gene families. We favour
the first scenario.
The present results imply a significant theoretical change
regarding the ancestry of the CYP19 gene family. This
investigation started with the observation that the human
aromatase gene maps to the MHC-paralogon. Nevertheless, two opposite scenarios could be draw from the phylogenetic analysis, paralogy and comparative genomics.
Either the CYP19 locus was present in the invertebrate
chordate unduplicated MHC-paralogon, and the presence
of a single paralogue resulted from gene loss; or CYP19
originated early on in vertebrate evolution in its present
position in the MHC-paralogon (figure 4). We went on to
test these hypotheses. Our results can be summarised as
follows: (1) vertebrate CYP19 containing regions are
indeed part of the MHC-paralogon as demonstrated by
the phylogenetic analysis of the gene families in close
proximity; (2) comparative genomics of the aromatase
region between fish, amphibians and humans shows a
striking pattern of conservation without any gene insertion; (3) following the previous analysis, we found that
CYP19 is not restricted to the vertebrate clade, given the
description of AmphiCYP19.
Our model determine the loss of three aromatase paralogues upon duplication of the ancestral MHC-paralogon.
For the vast majority of paralogy regions it is difficult to
precisely determine the amount of gene loss (due to the
absence of large sets mapping data from crucial organisms). In the case of the MHC-paralogon an estimate can
be calculated, given the previous work of several authors
[17,21,35]. The sequencing and mapping data of the
MHC anchor genes in amphioxus, shows a significant
proportion of gene families which are single-copy in both
lineages (seven out of eighteen, excluding the anchor
genes and those of unknown orthology; e.g. frequenin-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/43

like) [17,35]. Thus, the return to a single copy status
following the "en bloc" duplication was not a rare event
upon the duplication of the MHC-paralogon. At the
moment we do not known whether AmphiCYP19 maps
along with the MHC anchor genes in a single chromosome, but this hypothesis can be tested in the future [36].
Finally, we speculate that the ancestry of CYP19 genes
could be more ancient than invertebrate chordate origin.
Two reasons support this scenario. First, the sex steroid
receptors (estrogens and androgens/progesterone/corticoids) are older than previously proposed [13]. The estrogen receptor found in Aplysia indicates that the
duplication event from a sex steroid precursor receptor
pre-dates the divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes [13]. Also, the phylogenetic analysis and paralogy
studies of androgen, progesterone and corticoid receptors
suggests that a single receptor was present in the ancestral
Urbilateria [37]. Thus, the receptor gene kit for sex steroid
hormones was already present in the primitive Bilateria
(albeit not necessarily with a similar function). The second reason comes from Lophotrocozoan molluscs. These
organisms respond to steroid hormones (e.g. estradiol)
during their reproductive cycle [38]. Furthermore, biochemical analysis in mollusc tissue extracts reveals the
presence of an aromatase-like activity [39,40]. In light of
these findings and observations, we argue that the presence of CYP19 should be investigated in lophotrocozoan
protostomes (e.g. molluscs).

Conclusion
We present here a detailed study of the genomic region
containing the aromatase gene in three vertebrate
lineages. The gene families found in close proximity to
CYP19 show a clear pattern of vertebrate specific duplication, as expected from a paralogon. A key prediction from
paralogy regions is their unduplicated presence in pre-vertebrate genomes. Significantly, we have also found that
the genomic organisation of the human CYP19 genomic
region mimics that of Tetraodon and Xenopus. Overall our
analysis suggested the existence of aromatase in invertebrates. In agreement with this hypothesis we have found
a CYP19 orthologue in the invertebrate chordate amphioxus. Contrary to previous suggestions, our data implies
that CYP19 was present in the primitive chordate (and
probably even earlier).

MGC35274 [GenBank: NP_699205], TMOD2 [GenBank:
NP_055363], and TMOD3 [GenBank: NP_055362] (figure 2). In order to find invertebrate orthologues and vertebrate paralogues, protein sequence from each gene was
extracted and used for BLAST search (TBLASTN) against
GenBank and Ensembl. Accession numbers for each gene
are given in table 1.
Putative protein sequences for each gene family were
aligned using the CLUSTAL X program (version 1.8). The
produced alignments were further edited by eye to maximise the homologous regions (conserved domains)
(given upon request). The phylogenetic reconstruction
was based on conserved domains. If no domains were
identified, reconstruction's were performed using the fulllength alignment (without taking into account gaps or
ambiguous sites). The phylogenetic trees were constructed
using neighbor-joining from the CLUSTAL X program, on
an amino acid distance matrix calculated with the Dayoff
PAM option. Confidence on each node was assessed by
1000 bootstrap replicates. Trees were visualised with the
Treeview program (version 1.6.6).

Mapping data was retrieved from H. sapiens [41], T. nigroviridis [42], X. tropicalis [43] and C. intestinalis [44].
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
A BLAST search to the B. floridae trace archives of the
Whole Genome Sequence using the DNA sequence from
the stingray (D. sabina) CYP19 was done. Clone
AFSA830540 presented a significant E-value (data not
shown). Clone walk 5' and 3' allowed the determination
of further regions of CYP19 homology. To obtain a CYP19
sequence fragment an hemi-nested PCR approach was followed using DNA purified from an 5–24 h embryo cDNA
library (J. Langeland, Kalamazoo, USA). Three oligonucleotides (2 forward and 1 reverse) were designed in conserved regions using the available genomic sequence:
CYPF1 5' CTGGCTAACATCCGGGACAT 3'; CYPF2 5'
CAGTGCGTGACAGAAATGCT 3'; and CYPR1 5' GACGGGCTCAGTTGGTACAT 3'. PCR was carried out in 50 µl
reaction mixture consisting of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0,
1.5 mMMgCl2, KCl 50 mM, TritonX 0.1%, 10 µM of each
primer, 2 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 1U
DNA polymerase (Appligene Oncor). The first round of
PCR (oligonucleotides CYPF1 and CYPR1) had the following profile: initial cycle of denaturation, 94°C 2 min,
and forty amplification cycles with denaturation at 94°C
for 45 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C
for 1 min. An hemi-nested PCR was carried out afterwards
using the first PCR product as a sample. A similar PCR
profile was used with the exception of the extension time
– 45 s (oligonucleotides CYPF2 and CYPR1). The PCR
product was separated through 2% agarose gel and puri-
