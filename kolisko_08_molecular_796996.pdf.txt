Abstract
Background: Fornicata is a relatively recently established group of protists that includes the
diplokaryotic diplomonads (which have two similar nuclei per cell), and the monokaryotic
enteromonads, retortamonads and Carpediemonas, with the more typical one nucleus per cell. The
monophyly of the group was confirmed by molecular phylogenetic studies, but neither the internal
phylogeny nor its position on the eukaryotic tree has been clearly resolved.
Results: Here we have introduced data for three genes (SSU rRNA, α-tubulin and HSP90) with a
wide taxonomic sampling of Fornicata, including ten isolates of enteromonads, representing the
genera Trimitus and Enteromonas, and a new undescribed enteromonad genus. The diplomonad
sequences formed two main clades in individual gene and combined gene analyses, with Giardia (and
Octomitus) on one side of the basal divergence and Spironucleus, Hexamita and Trepomonas on the
other. Contrary to earlier evolutionary scenarios, none of the studied enteromonads appeared
basal to diplokaryotic diplomonads. Instead, the enteromonad isolates were all robustly situated
within the second of the two diplomonad clades. Furthermore, our analyses suggested that
enteromonads do not constitute a monophyletic group, and enteromonad monophyly was
statistically rejected in 'approximately unbiased' tests of the combined gene data.
Conclusion: We suggest that all higher taxa intended to unite multiple enteromonad genera be
abandoned, that Trimitus and Enteromonas be considered as part of Hexamitinae, and that the term
'enteromonads' be used in a strictly utilitarian sense. Our result suggests either that the
diplokaryotic condition characteristic of diplomonads arose several times independently, or that
the monokaryotic cell of enteromonads originated several times independently by secondary
reduction from the diplokaryotic state. Both scenarios are evolutionarily complex. More
comparative data on the similarity of the genomes of the two nuclei of diplomonads will be
necessary to resolve which evolutionary scenario is more probable.

Background
Diplomonads and their close relatives – enteromonads,
retortamonads and Carpediemonas membranifera – are
small flagellates that tend to be found in low-oxygen habitats. Recently they were classified within Fornicata (Metamonada, Excavata) [1]. Very recently an additional
member of Fornicata, Dysnectes brevis, was described [2].
Most diplomonads, all described enteromonads, and all
described retortamonads except one are endobionts or
parasites of animals, with several causing serious and
highly prevalent diseases in fish, domestic animals and
man [3].
Diplomonads and their relatives have been interesting for
students of the evolution of the eukaryotic cell for several
reasons. Firstly, they lack classical mitochondria. Secondly, diplomonads and their relatives branch at the base
of the eukaryotic tree in the majority of phylogenies in
which eukaryotes are rooted using prokaryotic outgroups
[4-6]. Thirdly, diplomonads, but not their relatives, possess a double karyomastigont, in other words, they have
two similar or identical nuclei and two flagellar apparatuses per cell [7,8]. In the late 1980s and early 1990s it was
widely supposed that the last common ancestor of most
or all living eukaryotes was a 'fornicate-like' amitochondriate organism [4,9], and some models even proposed
that almost all living eukaryotes were descended from
ancestors with a double karyomastigont [10]. The beststudied diplomonad – Giardia intestinalis (= G. lamblia)
was looked to as a model for understanding early eukaryotic cells.
Recent studies, however, have shown that Fornicata are
secondarily amitochondriate [11,12], and that many, perhaps all, retain mitochondrion-related organelles. Small
double membrane-bounded organelles called 'mitosomes' were identified in the diplomonad Giardia intestinalis using antibodies against IscS and IscU (nucleus
encoded proteins targeted to the mitochondrion of
eukaryotes) and the function of this organelle in iron-sulfur cluster synthesis was demonstrated in vitro [13]. Using
electron microscopy, a hydrogenosome-like double membrane-bounded organelle was observed superficially in
Carpediemonas membranifera [14]. Furthermore, the position of Fornicata at the base of rooted eukaryotic trees is
now thought by many to be caused by long-branch attraction [15-17]. Some authors, however, have argued that
this basal position might nonetheless still be correct [18].
Diplomonads and enteromonads deserve special attention within Fornicata. These two groups were considered
as closely related on the basis of ultrastructural studies
[3,7,8] and their close affinity was confirmed recently by
molecular phylogenetic methods [19]. The morphology
of diplomonads is extremely similar to the morphology of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/205

enteromonads – the main character distinguishing these
two groups is the doubled karyomastigont of diplomonads [3,7]. In a very simplified way, the cell of diplomonads could be described as two enteromonad cells joined
together (and conversely the enteromonad cell could be
described as half of a diplomonad cell). The most straightforward scenario explaining the evolution of the doubled
karyomastigont is that diplomonads arose from enteromonads in a single evolutionary event. Siddall, Hong and
Desser [8] proposed a mechanism of double karyomastigont formation from a single karyomastigont ancestor by
secondary karyokinesis (mitosis) and mastigont duplication after delay or arrest of cytokinesis (cell division),
resulting in a cell with four karyomastigonts. This cell
could then have divided into two cells, each with a doubled karyomastigont. However, some other authors consider as plausible the opposite scenario – secondary
simplification from the double karyomastigont morphology of diplomonads to the single karyomastigont morphology of enteromonads [1,20].
Our understanding of the internal phylogeny of Fornicata
is based to a large extent on molecular phylogenetic studies, especially with the relatively recent addition of several
important taxa to the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene
database, namely retortamonads [21], Carpediemonas
membranifera [22], Dysnectes brevis one clade of enteromonads [19], the diplomonad Octomitus sp. [23] and several new species from the diplomonad genera Spironucleus
and Hexamita [24]. The monophyly of Fornicata is very
strongly supported by molecular phylogenetic studies and
there is strong support for a position of Carpediemonas
membranifera and Dysnectes brevis at the base of the Fornicata clade [1,2,22,25]. Meanwhile molecular phylogenies
almost invariably divide diplomonads into two major
clades, Hexamitinae and Giardiinae, that were already recognized on morphological grounds by Kulda and
Nohýnková [3,19,21,24], with the former also identified
by the synapomorphy of a non-canonical genetic code
[26]. Recently the diplomonad Octomitus sp. was confirmed as a sister branch of Giardia within Giardiinae [23],
and at least one enteromonad group was surprisingly
shown to fall within Hexamitinae [19]. Nonetheless, our
understanding of the relationships amongst Fornicata is
incomplete. For example, different analyses of SSU rRNA
gene data place retortamonads either as a sister group of
the diplomonad-enteromonad clade [23], as predicted by
morphology [1,3], or as a sister branch of the GiardiaOctomitus clade, thereby making diplomonads appear
paraphyletic [19,21,22]. The main problem in resolving
the phylogeny of Fornicata is the limited amount of data,
both in terms of taxon sampling and the amount of
sequence information per taxon. For example, to date
only one enteromonad genus has been studied by molecular means, using only a single gene [19], whereas there

are three genera of enteromonads already described,
which are quite different in morphology, and enteromonads are generally not recovered as a clade in phylogenetic
analyses of morphological data [1,8].
In this study we aim to clarify relationships within fornicates, especially among enteromonads and Hexamitinae
diplomonads, and to better understand the evolutionary
history of single and double karyomastigonts. We introduce several important taxa into our molecular analyses,
including ten new isolates of enteromonads that represent
at least three genera. We also introduce two protein-coding genes into the analyses, α-tubulin and HSP90.

Results
SSU rDNA phylogeny
Our analyses of SSU rRNA genes include the broadest taxonomic sampling of Fornicates examined so far. In addition to previously available data we have included five
new isolates of the enteromonad genus Trimitus (the previously published strain KRPO3 was shown to be very
closely related to other representatives of the genus Trimitus, and therefore we consider KRPO3 as a member of
Trimitus), three new isolates of the genus Enteromonas, two
isolates of a new enteromonad genus (isolates PSEUD and
PYX, manuscript in preparation), an isolate of Trepomonas
steini (see Additional files 1 and 2), a new isolate corresponding to the morphospecies Trepomonas agilis (PPS-6),
a novel Spironucleus isolate (GEPA2H) and one uncultured eukaryote (CHESI2). We also extended the previously incomplete SSU rDNA sequence for Spironucleus
muris. Trimitus sp. – IT1 and Trimitus sp. – KOMPKOJ represent the first observations and isolations of free-living
enteromonads reported so far.

The SSU rDNA analyses were done using three different
alignments, 'large' including a broad eukaryotic outgroup,
'main' including all Fornicata and a restricted outgroup,
and 'small' including only Hexamitinae diplomonads and
enteromonads. Figure 1 shows the ML tree based on SSU
rRNA genes, with a restricted outgroup (i.e. the 'main'
data set). The overall topology of the SSU rDNA tree is as
follows: Fornicata forms a clade with high statistical support (bootstrap support – BS 100/99/88 and bayesian
posterior probability – PP 1), enteromonads branch
robustly within the Hexamitinae subtree (BS 100/99/100
and PP 1), and Giardia and Octomitus form the sister clade
of the Hexamitinae-enteromonad subtree, thus rendering
diplomonads plus enteromonads monophyletic to the
exclusion of retortamonads, but usually with low or no
statistical support (BS 43/40/85 and 0.43 PP). Very similar results were obtained when a broader outgroup sampling was employed ('large' dataset; statistical support for
Fornicata monophyly: BS 98/97/82 and PP 1; for
enteromonad-Hexamitinae monophyly: BS 99/98/99 and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/205

PP 1; for diplomonad/enteromonad monophyly: BS */*/
64, and not recovered in Bayesian analyses).
Given the strong support for a clade consisting of all Hexamitinae and all enteromonads, we performed additional
analyses with narrower taxon sampling to examine the
internal relationships of this grouping (Figure 2). Within
the Hexamitinae-enteromonad clade, members of the
genus Spironucleus form three separated basal clades in all
rooted analyses: i) Spironucleus vortens forms a clade with
S. salmonis; ii) S. barkhanus branches with S. torosa and S.
salmonicida; and iii) S. muris and S. meleagridis form a
clade (see Figure 1). Our isolate of Spironucleus, GEPA2H,
branches as a sister of S. torosa, suggesting that it could be
an isolate of this species, although the genetic distance
between GEPA2H and S. torosa is greater than that
between S. barkhanus and S. salmonicida (Figure 2). Representatives of the genus Enteromonas constitute a weakly
supported or unsupported clade in analyses of the main
and small datasets, but are polyphyletic in the ML tree
estimated for the large dataset, because the isolate
Enteromonas hominis branches as a sister to Spironucleus
muris and S. meleagridis. The members of the genus Hexamita and uncultured eukaryote CHESI2 form a clade with
the enteromonads of the genus Trimitus, as well as with
the new enteromonad genus. All Trimitus isolates constitute a highly supported monophyletic group. Hexamita,
by contrast, does not constitute a monophyletic group
within that clade. Genus Trepomonas constitutes an unsupported clade (17% ML bootstrap support) in analyses of
the main and small datasets and forms a paraphyletic
group in analyses of the large data set.
Concatenation of SSU rDNA, and protein gene data
We have obtained sequences of HSP90 and/or α-tubulin
coding genes for all outstanding sampled genera of diplomonads, except Trepomonas. For three taxa we obtained
only one of the protein coding genes (Table 1). Interestingly, the alternative genetic code usage described earlier
in all Hexamitinae (TAA and TAG encode glutamine
instead of stop codons; 26), was also identified in the protein coding gene sequences from two out of three
enteromonad genera (Enteromonas and the undescribed
enteromonad genus). Analyses of HSP90 and α-tubulin
genes support the monophyly of the genus Enteromonas,
as Enteromonas GECA2 and Enteromonas hominis ENTEROII constitute a highly supported clade in both cases (see
Additional files 1, 3 and 4).

The phylogenetic tree estimated for the concatenated SSU
rDNA, HSP90 and α-tubulin data is shown in Figure 3. As
in the SSU rDNA trees, Spironucleus vortens and Spironucleus salmonicida branch paraphyletically at the base of
the Hexamitinae-enteromonad clade with high statistical
support. Spironucleus muris, the genera Enteromonas,

Hexamita and Trimitus, and the new enteromonad genus
(represented by isolate PSEUD) constitute a clade with
weakly resolved internal relationships. By contrast, Giardia intestinalis branches as a sister group of the Hexamitinae-enteromonad clade with high statistical support (BS
82), leaving retortamonads in a sister position to the
whole 'diplomonads plus enteromonads' clade.
AU tests
In order to explore further the evolutionary positions of
enteromonads we performed AU tests of alternative topologies. In the case of the SSU rRNA gene data, we compared
a set of 1000 reasonable trees, including both the ML tree
and the topology of highest likelihood in which enteromonads were monophyletic. For the concatenated dataset,
α-tubulin, and HSP90, all reasonable trees were examined
(945, 945, and 15 trees respectively, see Methods). The
monophyly of enteromonads was not rejected by analyses
of any one single gene. In the analysis of the concatenated
dataset, however, the monophyly of enteromonads was
rejected at the level of 5% (p = 0.048).

Discussion
Molecular phylogeny of Fornicata
Our analyses of SSU rRNA genes include the broadest taxonomic sampling of Fornicata published so far. Our
results are generally consistent with those of other recent
studies [19,21-23]. The genus Spironucleus constitutes
three separate branches close to the base of the Hexamitinae-enteromonad subtree. This topology is in good agreement with previous studies [21,24,27], however, all three
clades of Spironucleus constitute long branches and their
position at the base of the Hexamitinae-enteromonad
subtree could be a long-branch attraction artifact [15]. The
presence of Spironucleus isolate GEPA2H within the clade
of Spironucleus barkhanus, S. torosa, and S. salmonicida is
noteworthy, since GEPA2H was isolated from the terrestrial tortoise Geochelone pardalis, while the latter three species infect marine teleosts. This argues against Jørgensen

and Sterud's [24] proposal that there are more-or-less distinct marine, freshwater, and terrestrial clades within
Spironucleus. The internal relationships within the remainder of the Hexamitinae-enteromonad subtree were weakly
or not supported and vary widely with the method of tree
reconstruction and alignment. Further data will be
required for a complete picture of the relationships within
Hexamitinae.
Analyses of concatenated genes quite strongly support the
monophyly of diplomonads plus enteromonads to the
exclusion of retortamonads and Carpediemonas, albeit
within the context of a smaller taxon sampling than is
presently available for SSU rDNA alone. This supports
previous morphological studies and analyses [1,7,8] but
contrasts with some previous studies of SSU rDNA data, in
which retortamonads branch weakly within diplomonads, as the sister group to Giardiinae [19,21,22]. The tendency for retortamonads to branch within diplomonads
in SSU rDNA analyses is most probably an analysis artifact, but the cause of this artifact is not clear. Our preliminary analyses do not support the notion that either base
composition heterogeneity (Giardia SSU rDNA is notable
for its high GC content, however neither LogDet distance
correction nor RY recoding results in a different well
resolved topology) or simple long-branch attraction is to
blame (data not shown). It is also possible that SSU rDNA
simply does not contain enough information to resolve
the phylogenetic relationships among the ingroup taxa.
The positions of enteromonads
Enteromonads and Hexamitinae diplomonads form a
monophyletic group to the exclusion of other Fornicata.
This is consistent with previous molecular phylogenies
that included a much smaller sampling of enteromonads
[19] and one morphological study [1]. The clade has very
strong statistical support in our analyses, and is further
supported by a molecular synapomorphy: the non-canonical genetic code common to all studied Hexamitinae [26]

appears also to be present in at least two of the three
enteromonads for which we obtained protein-coding
gene sequence data.

The most striking result of our study is the non-monophyly of enteromonads. The possibility of enteromonads
being polyphyletic was suggested speculatively by Simpson [1] on the basis of morphological data. The internal
relationships of the Hexamitinae-enteromonad clade are

Page 7 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:205

weakly supported at present, and need further investigation. More extensive taxon sampling for studied proteincoding genes is necessary, as well as more protein-coding
genes. Nonetheless, our results support the non-monophyletic status of enteromonads, as the monophyly of
enteromonads was rejected by AU test with the concatenated data set. Interestingly, none of the single gene phylogenies themselves rejected enteromonad monophyly.
The differing results from analysis of the concatenated
dataset and the single-gene datasets could be caused either
by an insufficient amount of data in single gene analyses
or by conflicting signal between single gene phylogenies.
However, none of the single gene ML trees was rejected in
AU tests of the concatenated dataset, suggesting that there
is no strong conflict between single gene phylogenies. It is
reasonable to assume therefore that the rejection of
enteromonad monophyly on the basis of concatenated
data, but not in to single gene analyses, is due to insufficient signal rather than conflicting single-gene data.
Many authors have treated diplomonads and enteromonads as taxa of equivalent rank [3,7,28], implicitly or
explicitly reflecting a widespread assumption that diplomonads and enteromonads are sister clades, or that
enteromonads represent a paraphyletic group from which
a monophyletic diplomonads group evolved [8,28]. Our
analysis demonstrates, however, that many, and probably
all enteromonads fall within diplomonads and specifically within Hexamitinae. Moreover, enteromonads represent a non-monophyletic group within Hexamitinae.
There is no possible interpretation of our results that
would allow recognition of diplomonads and enteromonads as separate taxa, without at least one of them being
polyphyletic. Therefore, we suggest that the taxon Diplomonadida and any of its effective synonyms be considered to include enteromonads, and that the taxa
Enteromonadida and Enteromonadinae no longer be
used. The term 'enteromonads' should be taken to have a
purely descriptive, and not taxonomic, meaning.
Evolution of single and double karyomastigont cell
organization
In a previous study [19] it was shown that at least one
enteromonad clade branches within diplomonads, and
branches with or within the diplomonad subgroup Hexamitinae, suggesting either that enteromonads are secondarily simplified, possibly in one evolutionary event, or
that the double karyomastigont morphology characteristic of diplomonads arose more than once during their
evolution. Our present study indicates that enteromonads
do not constitute a monophyletic group within Hexamitinae, and thus switches between single- and double-karyomastigont morphology must have occurred several times
during evolution, irrespective of the direction in which
these switches occurred. If we assume only one direction

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/205

of change within the diplomonad-enteromonad clade
and assuming, for argument's sake, that our topologies are
correct, there are two basic possibilities: either the doublekaryomastigont morphology arose many times in closely
related groups (at least seven times according to the SSU
rRNA gene tree, or at least five times, according to the multigene analyses) or enteromonads arose by secondary
reduction from double-karyomastigont ancestors at least
three times independently.
There are three potential scenarios describing the switch
between single and double karyomastigont morphologies
(Fig 4). For comparison, the standard cell cycle of an
enteromonad is depicted in Figure 4A.
1. The switch from single karyomastigont morphology to
double karyomastigont morphology was envisaged by
Siddall, Hong and Desser [8] as a change in the relative
timing between karyokinesis and cytokinesis (Figure 4B).
Under this model a cell with a single karyomastigont goes
through nuclear and mastigont division and is prepared
for cell division. Cell division is arrested, however, and the
cell goes through another nuclear and mastigont division,
resulting in a cell with four karyomastigonts. The cell with
four karyomastigonts then divides into two cells, each
with a double karyomastigont.
2. The opposite switch (Figure 4C), from a double to single karyomastigont, could also be explained as a change in
the timing of karyokinesis and cytokinesis. Cells with a
double karyomastigont morphology could just go
through cell division without nuclear and mastigont division. Another similar event would involve a cell with four
karyomastigonts (i.e. a cell normally with a double karyomastigont prepared for cell division) dividing into four
daughter cells instead of two.
3. The last scenario suggests fusion of the nuclei in a cell
with the double-karyomastigont morphology. The resulting cell could then lose the second mastigont, resulting in
a cell with a single-karyomastigont morphology.
These scenarios have different strengths and weaknesses
in terms of plausibility. Scenario one seems implausible
from a phylogenetic perspective, as it requires a very large
number of parallel evolutions of the distinctive doubled
cell morphology within the diplomonad-enteromonad
clade. Scenario two invokes many fewer evolutionary
events, but requires that the two nuclei of the parental
diplomonad cell be nearly identical (or, at a minimum,
that at least one of the nuclei retains all essential genes),
otherwise the single karyomastigont progeny would not
be viable. Scenario three requires the same number of evolutionary transitions as scenario two, and is compatible
with a diplomonad parent that had non-identical and

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:205

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/205

allow essential genes to be lost from one or the other
nucleus, such that both nuclei would soon be required for
the cell lineage to persist and any uninucleate progeny
would be unviable. However, this could be avoided if
there were mechanisms that frequently generated cells in
which both nuclei were copies of a single parental nucleus
(most likely a sexual process).
Empirical data on the nature of diplomonad nuclei are
limited and conflicting. The human parasite Giardia intestinalis is the only diplomonad whose molecular and cellular biology has been studied in detail. Yu, Birky and Adam
[30] used probes against selected genes to indicate that
each nucleus of G. intestinalis contains a complete set of
genetic information. Bernarder, Palm and Svard [31] have
also deduced from results of FACS analysis that the two
nuclei of G. intestinalis are diploid. The genome sequence
of Giardia intestinalis (lamblia) strain WB clone C6 was
published by Morrison et al. [32], and minimal heterozygosity was detected. Very recently, a process of physical
transfer of DNA between nuclei was reported in Giardia
cysts [33]. However, Tůmová et al. [29] reported that the
two nuclei of G. intestinalis possess different numbers of
chromosomes. The focus on Giardia is unfortunate in
some respects, as Giardia is a highly specialized parasite
with an organization of cytoskeletal components (at least)
that is substantially different from other diplomonads. It
is possible that results obtained for Giardia may not be
applicable to other diplomonads. Giardia also represents
the diplomonad group that is most distantly related to the
various enteromonad taxa. It would be of great interest to
compare the nuclei in one or more Hexamitinae diplomonads (e.g.: Spironucleus, Hexamita or Trepomonas).

essential nuclei, but is otherwise a more complex mechanism. Therefore, the key to understanding the evolution
of nucleus number in diplomonads lies in knowing
whether the nuclei of diplomonads are identical. Naïvely,
it might be expected that the nuclei are non-identical,
since one copy of each nucleus is transmitted to each
daughter cell during division [29], and, in principle at
least, the two nuclei would represent separate lineages
once the diplomonad state has been fixed. This would

There are some observations that would support scenario
1, albeit indirectly. Firstly, the populations of enteromonads often contain some double individuals resembling
Hexamita in their morphology, with two fully developed
karyomastigonts and no apparent signs of cytokinesis
[[7,34], M. K. personal observation]. This may suggest that
there is some general tendency for delayed or arrested
cytokinesis. Secondly, a recent study of the flagellar cycle
of Giardia intestinalis has shown that the two karyomastigonts are not independent, as basal bodies migrate
between the two karyomastigonts [35]. This means that
the flagellar maturation cycle would be corrupted in cells
that switched back to a single karyomastigont.
Our molecular phylogenies contradict any scenario invoking just one unique evolutionary transition between single and double karyomastigont morphologies within
diplomonads. According to the inferred topology, the
most parsimonious scenario would have one transition
from single to double karyomastigont morphology at the
base of diplomonads and several independent reversals to

the single karyomastigont morphology. However, taking
into account possible inaccuracies in our estimated tree,
principally involving Spironucleus, and the limited data on
diplomonad cell biology, several independent transitions
from single to double morphology (and no reversals) cannot be excluded. More data on the molecular and cellular
biology of diplomonads in addition to Giardia will be
necessary for understanding the enigmatic evolution of
the double karyomastigont of diplomonads.

Conclusion

Our analyses of SSU rRNA, HSP90 and α-tubulin genes
strongly positioned all enteromonads within Hexamitinae diplomonads and showed that enteromonads do not
constitute a monophyletic group. These results suggest
that transformations between single- and double-karyomastigont morphologies have occurred several times during the evolution of diplomonads, however, it is not
possible to confidently determine the direction of these
switches without more information about the cellular and
molecular biology of diplomonads and enteromonads.
We suggest that the high level taxa Enteromonadida,
Enteromonadidae and Enteromonadinae should be abandoned and the genera Enteromonas and Trimitus should be
considered as members of Hexamitinae diplomonads.
The term 'enteromonad' should have a purely utilitarian
meaning – Diplomonadida with a single karyomastigont.

Methods
Cultures
Isolates used in this study are summarized in Table 2. All
enteromonad isolates were obtained from animal guts or
feces, except isolates KOMPKOJ and IT1, which were free
living. Trepomonas steini and Trepomonas sp.-PPS6 were
isolated from anoxic fresh water sediments by the authors.
A culture of Spironucleus vortens was obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC #50386). DNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/205

from Spironucleus muris was isolated from purified cysts
obtained from the intestine of a SCID laboratory mouse.
Xenic cultures of enteromonads were grown in DobellLeidlaw biphasic medium [36] and in TYSGM medium
[37] without tween and mucin at 21°C, 27°C and 37°C.
Spironucleus vortens was grown axenically in TYI-S33
medium as modified for Giardia at 27°C [38]. Trepomonas
sp.-PPS6 and Trepomonas steini were grown in cerophyll
medium (ATCC #802) at 21°C (Table 2). DNA from
Spironucleus sp. GEPA2H and uncultured eukaryote
CHESI2 was isolated from crude cultures.
Gene amplification and sequencing
Genomic DNA was isolated using a High Pure PCR template kit (Roche Applied Science, UK) or using CTAB and
organic extractions [39]. SSU rDNA sequences were
amplified by PCR using primers 'EntUnvF' and 'EntUnvR'
[19] or universal eukaryotic primers [40]. In the case of
the 'new enteromonad genus' isolate 'PSEUD', the culture
also contained a retortamonad species. The SSU rDNA
segments from both eukaryotes were amplified and partially sequenced. Specific primers for the 'new enteromonad
genus',
DimA
(5'AGTCAAAGATTAAAACATGCATAT-3') and DimB (5'TCCTCTAAGCCTTCTAGTTCGTGCAAA-3') were then
designed and used for amplification of the SSU rDNA
from isolate 'PYX', which is an enteromonad closely
related to isolate 'PSEUD'. A specific forward primer
(SSUSmur20F 5'-AACTGCGGACGGCTCATT-3') was
designed for S. muris and used with the universal eukaryotic reverse primer.

Alpha-tubulin genes were amplified using primers AtubA
and AtubB [41] and then by nested PCR with primers αtubF1 and α-tubR1 [42]. HSP90 genes were amplified
using primers H90100X [43] and H90910XR [25]. The
annealing temperatures used were 45–53°C, 45–50°C

and 48–53°C for SSU rDNA, α-tubulin and HSP90,
respectively. SSU rDNA amplicons were sequenced
directly where possible. Otherwise, major PCR fragments
of the expected sizes were subcloned (TOPO TA cloning
kit for sequencing, pCR4-TOPO vector, Invitrogen, USA;
or pGEM-T Easy vector cloning kit, Promega, USA) and
several clones (2–6) were partially sequenced. Obtained
sequences were then subjected to BLAST searches [44] to
confirm their identity. At least one of the positive clones
was fully sequenced bidirectionally by primer walking. All
sequences obtained during this study are deposited in
GenBank [GenBank: EF551168 – EF551186, EU043230,
AY921407 and AY921408].
Phylogenetic analyses
Alignments
All alignments used in this study were constructed using
the program ClustalX 1.83 [45] followed by manual editing in the program BioEdit 7.0.5.3 [46] and are available
upon request (see Additional files 1 and 5 for details
about the sequences used).
SSU rRNA genes
Two data sets were constructed including all near-fulllength Fornicata sequences, except some redundant close
relatives within Giardia and retortamonads, plus an outgroup consisting of either i) a broad diversity of eukaryotes (large dataset), or ii) a few supposed close relatives of
Fornicata – the excavate groups Parabasalia, Trimastix,
Oxymonadida, Malawimonas and Andalucia (main dataset). These datasets included 887 and 1041 well-aligned
sites, respectively. An additional dataset was generated
that included only Hexamitinae and enteromonads, and
also included 1041 sites (small dataset).

Each dataset was analyzed using several likelihood-based
phylogenetic methods. The model of sequence evolution
was selected by the Akaike information criterion, as
implemented in the program Modeltest 3.7 [47]. The general time reversible model of nucleotide substitution was
used, with among-site rate variation modeled by a gamma
distribution and a proportion of invariable sites (GTR + Γ
+ I model), with the gamma distribution approximated by
4 equiprobable discrete categories. Maximum likelihood
(ML) analyses were performed using the program
PAUP*4B10 [48], with 10 random taxon additions followed by tree bisection and reconnection branch rearrangements, while ML bootstrap support (200 replicates)
was estimated using PAUP*4B10 (10 random taxa additions followed by TBR; for the large dataset only the ML
bootstrap analysis was instead performed using the program IQPNNI 3.0.1. [49]), and LRSH-RELL bootstrapping
(1000 replicates) was performed using the program Treefinder (version: February 2007) [50]. The model of
sequence evolution used was the same for all ML analyses.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/205

Least squares distance trees were estimated from ML distances using PAUP*4B10 and bootstrapped with 1000
replicates (each searched using 10 replicates of random
taxon addition with TBR branch swapping). The Bayesian
analysis was performed using the program MrBayes 3.1.2
[51], using the GTR + Γ + I model with two runs, each with
four independent chains running for 3 × 106 generations
(a burn-in of 5 × 105 generations was used), with default
heating parameter and sampling frequency (which was
also used in all subsequent Bayesian analyses).
Analyses of protein coding genes
The HSP90 and α-tubulin amino acid datasets included
all available Fornicata sequences and an extensive eukaryotic outgroup consisting of representatives from major
eukaryotic groups. The trimmed alignments included 370
sites for α-tubulin and 493 sites for HSP90. Both datasets
were analyzed using the WAG + Γ + I model [52]. The
WAG matrix was selected over other substitution matrices
by the Akaike information criterion, as implemented in
the program ProtTest 1.4 [53]. For each, the ML tree was
estimated and bootstrap support (500 replicates) was estimated using IQPNNI 3.0.1, while LRSH-RELL bootstrap
support (1000 replicates) was determined using Treefinder (version: February 2007). In addition, a Bayesian
analysis (WAG + Γ + I model) was performed using
MrBayes 3.1.2, with four independent chains running for
2 × 106 generations, and with a conservative burn-in of 5
× 105 generations.
Analyses of concatenated SSU rDNA and protein sequences
The concatenated alignment of SSU rDNA, α-tubulin and
HSP90 genes was analyzed using the program MrBayes
3.1.2 (two runs each with four independent chains running for 5 × 106 generations with a burn-in of 1.5 × 106
generations), with among-site rate variation for each gene
modeled by a discrete approximation of a gamma distribution, proportion of invariable sites and a covarion
model. The GTR substitution model was used for the SSU
rDNA partition and the WAG substitution matrix [52] was
used for the protein coding genes. The branch lengths, α
parameter, proportion of invariable sites and parameter
for switching rates in the covarion model were estimated
separately for each gene (both runs converged to the same
level). The branch lengths in the depicted tree are those
estimated for the HSP90 partition of the data (The alternative of displaying the average of the estimated branch
lengths over all three genes was not followed on the
grounds that this average does not reflect any actual
parameter examined under the model of evolution we
used). In addition to examining posterior probabilities we
performed a full bootstrap analysis with 100 replicate
samples. Each gene was re-sampled independently (using
the program Seqboot from the Phylip package [54]) and
then each bootstrap sample was created by concatenating

Page 11 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:205

one replicate from each gene. Each bootstrap replicate was
analyzed under the same conditions as the starting dataset
but using only 2.5 × 105 generations (a burn-in of 50000
generations was used). The consensus tree was made for
each bootstrap replicate in MrBayes 3.1.2. The bootstrap
consensus tree was then estimated from the 100 resulting
trees using the program Consense from the package
Phylip 3.67 [54].
Testing of topologies
The topologies were compared using 'Approximately
Unbiased' (AU) tests implemented in the program Consel
1.19 [55]. We performed separate AU tests on four datasets – 1. SSU rRNA genes, 2. α-tubulin, 3. HSP90, and 4.
the concatenated dataset (with the missing genes treated
as missing data). For the SSU rRNA test, the small dataset,
which includes only Hexamitinae and enteromonads was
used. For the α-tubulin, HSP90 and combined datasets,
the alignments used for estimating the ML tree were used,
except that taxa other than Hexamitinae and enteromonads were excluded. For AU tests using the SSU rRNA gene
data we generated a set of ,reasonable trees'. This set was
generated by saving the 999 trees with the highest likelihood found during ML analyses in PAUP*4B10 (10 random sequence additions plus TBR). The tree representing
monophyletic enteromonads was generated using a constraint search in PAUP*4B10 (10 random addition replicates plus TBR). In the case of α-tubulin, HSP90, and
concatenated analyses, we included all possible trees that
were consistent with a constraint where nodes corresponding to those that had received 100% bootstrap support in the concatenated genes analysis were fixed. Site
likelihoods were calculated using PAUP*4B10 for the SSU
rRNA gene data, and using the PAML package [56] for protein data. For the concatenated gene analysis site likelihoods were generated separately for all three genes and
then concatenated prior to analysis in Consel 1.19.
