Abstract
Background: We present here the PhIGs database, a phylogenomic resource for sequenced
genomes. Although many methods exist for clustering gene families, very few attempt to create
truly orthologous clusters sharing descent from a single ancestral gene across a range of
evolutionary depths. Although these non-phylogenetic gene family clusters have been used broadly
for gene annotation, errors are known to be introduced by the artifactual association of slowly
evolving paralogs and lack of annotation for those more rapidly evolving. A full phylogenetic
framework is necessary for accurate inference of function and for many studies that address
pattern and mechanism of the evolution of the genome. The automated generation of evolutionary
gene clusters, creation of gene trees, determination of orthology and paralogy relationships, and
the correlation of this information with gene annotations, expression information, and genomic
context is an important resource to the scientific community.
Discussion: The PhIGs database currently contains 23 completely sequenced genomes of fungi and
metazoans, containing 409,653 genes that have been grouped into 42,645 gene clusters. Each gene
cluster is built such that the gene sequence distances are consistent with the known organismal
relationships and in so doing, maximizing the likelihood for the clusters to represent truly
orthologous genes. The PhIGs website contains tools that allow the study of genes within their
phylogenetic framework through keyword searches on annotations, such as GO and InterPro
assignments, and sequence similarity searches by BLAST and HMM. In addition to displaying the
evolutionary relationships of the genes in each cluster, the website also allows users to view the
relative physical positions of homologous genes in specified sets of genomes.
Summary: Accurate analyses of genes and genomes can only be done within their full
phylogenetic context. The PhIGs database and corresponding website http://phigs.org address this
problem for the scientific community. Our goal is to expand the content as more genomes are
sequenced and use this framework to incorporate more analyses.

Background
The continually increasing number of whole genome
sequencing projects has underscored the need for a highthroughput methodology to sort genes into orthologous
sets to facilitate genome analysis. With a more robust
understanding of the evolutionary history for each gene in
the genome, not only can we more accurately transfer
annotation across organisms, but we can also address
larger biological questions regarding the evolution of
genomes and species as well as the functional and biochemical processes encoded within each genome. Currently, most gene annotations rely on homologs
identified by pair-wise sequence similarity to transfer the
presumed function. This approach has been shown to
have many drawbacks [1] which lead to annotation errors.
Incorrect assignments are generally due to gene duplication events [2] giving rise to paralogs that can then acquire
a new function or sub-functionalize [3,4], accelerated
rates of amino acid substitution [5] and domain shuffling
[6]. Simple pair-wise comparisons cannot uncover these
events.
Several approaches have been proposed to address these
problems. However, most of these retain the problems
associated with simply clustering genes based on
sequence similarity and fail to incorporate the known evolutionary relationships of species [7-9]. Alternatively,
those approaches that attempt to use some aspect of the
evolutionary relationships of the species to inform the
clustering process fail to then create a phylogenetic tree to
uncover the relationships of the genes within the clusters
[10-12].
The method we present here considers a priori the known
evolutionary relationships among the considered organisms as a guide to constructing gene clusters, then analyzes
each cluster for the evolutionary relationships among the
contained genes in order to reconstruct the evolutionary
history of each gene family using standard analytical
methods of molecular evolution. This provides a tool for
the scientific community for gaining a more complete
understanding of such things as evolutionary patterns of
gene duplication and loss, variation in rates of amino acid
substitution, and alterations in gene structure. PhIGs is
the first truly comprehensive whole genome analysis phylogenetic tool allowing for accurate assessment of gene
family and genome structure evolution.

Construction and content
In this work, we develop a computational framework for
the identification of sets of genes which have all
descended from a single ancestral gene in the common
ancestor of the lineages being examined. This collection of
genes is then followed by the construction of phylogenetic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/201

trees for each set to determine relationships of the gene
cluster members.
A relational database is used to store the genome annotations for each taxon. All sequence data as well as individual gene annotations, including InterPro [13] and Gene
Ontology [14] assignments, intron, exon and UTR structural information, and genomic positional information
are retrieved whenever available. In addition, results of
analyses such as sequence alignments, intermediate data,
and trees are stored in the database. Table 1 lists the
genomes included in the current data set, which will be
updated as more genome sequences become available.
The overall process involves five stages (Figure 1)
explained in more detail below: (1) an all against all
BLASTP [15] of the complete proteomes; (2) global alignment and distance calculation of the gene pairs identified
by BLAST; (3) iterative, hierarchical clustering; (4) multiple sequence alignment (MSA) creation and editing; and
(5) gene tree reconstruction.
All against all BLASTP and global alignment
An all-against-all BLASTP search is performed on the
entire protein dataset derived from each genome. Because
each BLAST only reports local alignments, a global alignment is created for each protein pair returned by BLAST
with ClustalW [16]. A protein distance is then calculated
using the JTT matrix and the protdist program from
PHYLIP [17], hereafter referred to as the distance between
genes themselves. These pair-wise protein distances and
gap-free alignment lengths are then used as input for the
clustering process. All alignments are stored in the PhIGs
database.
Gene clustering
Gene clustering is performed at each node of the tree,
using the known evolutionary relationships of the organisms and all pair-wise protein distances as input. The
objective of the clustering process is to create gene clusters
at each node of the evolutionary tree such that the genes
of the descending taxa are more closely related to each
other than they are to the genes from the outgroup taxa.
We employ a hierarchical approach, starting at the base of
the best known evolutionary tree of the organisms, and
proceeding up the tree iteratively. For each bifurcating
node, taxa are temporarily grouped such that those on one
descending branch are labeled as clade A and those on the
other as clade B. The remaining taxa, having branched earlier, are considered to be the outgroup (Figure 2). Clusters
of genes are then constructed such that the included genes
meet the following criteria: (1) Genes from organisms
within clade A are more similar to each other than they are
to genes from organisms within clade B; and (2) genes
from clade A and clade B are more closely related to each

other than they are to any gene in the outgroup. Effectively, this can be achieved by first finding the top scoring
alignment for each gene within any member of its sister
clade, then recruiting all additional genes that have greater
similarity to either one of these genes using single linkage
clustering with inclusion criteria being set to the distance
and alignment length of the alignment of the seed. As
illustrated in Figure 2, the initial seed alignment of a pair
of genes, one from each of clade A and clade B, defines an
area shown in blue around representing the minimum
match quality. As more genes are added to the cluster, this
area grows until no more genes can be added.
Because this clustering approach is dependent on seeds,
the order in which the seeds are processed will affect the
clustering results. To ensure that each gene is placed in its
optimal cluster, a greedy approach is used by sorting the
list of seed alignments by the BLASTP score and processing the seeds by using the highest scoring seed first. In so
doing, any subsequent cluster that attempts to incorporate
a gene which has already been clustered can be eliminated. It is important to note that the BLASTP score is only
used to sort the seeds and clustering is based on the pro-

tein distance and alignment length. The pseudocode
describing this method is available online as additional
file 1: Cluster Pseudocode.
By using an iterative approach, working through the entire
evolutionary tree of the organisms beginning at the base,
we ensure that the most early diverging gene families create the most comprehensive clusters, with later established families properly assigned to the lineages in which
they arose. Genes with a highly accelerated amino acid
substitution rate, such that they are more distantly related
to their sister genes than those sister genes are to a gene
from the outgroup, are always excluded, since this cannot
be differentiated from ancestral paralogy.
MSA and phylogenetic tree creation
A multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is created for each
cluster using the ClustalW [16] program, which provides
the input for phylogenetic tree reconstruction. Alignments
are trimmed to remove columns that contain gap characters and the cluster is eliminated if the resulting alignment
contains fewer than 100 aligned amino acid positions.
Phylogenetic trees are created using the quartet puzzling

maximum likelihood method implemented in the TREEPUZZLE [18] program using the JTT model of amino acid
substitution and a gamma distribution of rates over eight
rate categories with 10,000 puzzling steps to assess reliability. Quartet puzzling is chosen here as a compromise
between speed and reliability; however, the multiple
sequence alignment is available for re-analysis with other
tree reconstruction methods. The resulting gene tree is
then reconciled with the known relationships of the
organisms to determine, relative to lineage splitting, when
each duplication or loss occurred, and so to determine an
initial estimate of the orthology and paralogy relationships among the genes. The reconciliation process uses
the most straight-forward interpretation of the tree; no
alterations are made to minimize the number of duplications or gene loss events. Genes are considered orthologs
if they are separated only by speciation nodes consistent
with the known phylogenetic tree and considered paralogs if there is a node representing a duplication event in
their shared ancestry.

The MSAs are also used to create Hidden Markov Models
(HMMs) to later facilitate searching the clusters and to
provide a resource for placing genes from genomes too
sparsely sampled to be included in this comprehensive
analysis, such as those from many EST sequencing
projects.
An instructive example of this process is for the SuccinylCoenzyme A ligase beta subunit family. In this example,
considering the fungi and metazoans first as clade A and
clade B, respectively, the seed alignment used is the match
between a gene from M. grisea and one from mouse
(Sucla2). The protein distance measure and gap free alignment length of this seed alignment pair is now taken to
represent the maximum distance and minimum alignment length for recruiting new genes to the cluster. Any
fungal or metazoan gene with a shorter distance and larger
alignment length is added. In this case the fungal gene
recruits a single gene from each of the remaining fungal
genomes and the mouse gene recruits two genes in each
case from most of the remaining metazoan genomes and
three genes from each of human, chimp, and mouse. All

proteins that have a shorter distance than the seed until no additions can be made. The blue cloud represents one such cluster.

of these genes now included in the cluster have matches
to each other that are as good or better than the initial
seed alignment and do not have better matches to any
other cluster. The phylogenetic tree created for this cluster
ultimately shows that this gene family had a duplication
at the base of the metazoan lineage, another duplication
at the base of the primate lineage, and an independent
duplication in the mouse lineage.

Utility
Cluster view
The PhIGs database allows users to view genes within the
evolutionary context of other sequenced genomes.
Because each cluster is constructed to represent the extant
descendants of a single ancestral gene, the gene trees provided allow the user to see where gene duplication events
have occurred and the rates of amino acid sequence
change along the individual branches of the tree (Figure

3). By reconciling the gene tree with the species tree,
orthology and paralogy relationships can be determined.
Comparisons of differences and similarities in annotations, such as definition line (defline) gene descriptions,
InterPro families, and Gene Ontology assignments, can be
made with respect to the tree. The user can make a determination of whether the gene annotations are consistent
with the tree topology and whether annotations should be
transferred to unannotated genes. Additionally, the
genomic location and intron and exon structure of each
gene is also provided, enabling analysis of such issues as
whether the paralogous genes are physically clustered
within a genome, indicating tandem or segmental duplication, or whether the gene family is widely dispersed.
Alterations in gene intron and exon structure (and sizes)
relative to other members of the cluster may be the result
of biological forces acting on the genome or may simply
be indicative of poor gene modeling.

Figure 3
An example phylogenetic tree
An example phylogenetic tree. This is one output of the PhIGs analysis that is shown on the Cluster View webpage.
Instead of simply listing the members of a cluster, a phylogenetic tree is created showing the evolutionary relationships of this
multigene family. In this example, we can see that this family had gene duplication events at the base of vertebrates and in the
fish lineage. Because the branch lengths are proportional to the rate of amino acid substitutions, we can see how rates of evolution have varied.

The MSA for each cluster is also made available in the
Cluster View. An alignment graphic, with the intron and
exon structure superimposed, is shown on the page and a
detailed alignment view is provided through a Jalview
[19] java applet. By examining the MSA, the user can
determine whether poorly aligning or missing regions of
a gene contains a protein domain which may indicate the
gain or loss of some function. Of course, when dealing
with gene models of unknown quality, the genomic
sequence should be examined for the possibility of annotation error before concluding an exon or domain loss
occurred.
Gene view
All annotations related to each gene are viewable on its
Gene View web page. This includes the annotations presented on the Cluster View page as well as a summary of
domains found with the InterProScan [20] program (not
available for all genomes) and a summary of all pair-wise
alignments, including the calculated protein distance.

This pair-wise alignment information can be useful to
determine whether any genes may have been left out of
the cluster for failing to meet the distance and alignment
length cutoffs. In some cases, this appears to be a gene
model that is erroneously fragmented or merged with
another, and so PhIGs provides a powerful tool for detecting these potential errors.
Searching
Searches of the database can be done by sequence similarity or by text matches to annotation fields. Text searches
can be done on gene names, deflines, or InterPro annotations. Because these are associated with individual genes,
the search function can be used to either return a list of
genes from a selected set of taxa that contain the search
term or it can return a set of clusters which contain genes
matching the search term. Because all clustering is done at
the protein level, sequence similarity searches can only be
performed against protein datasets. An individual
sequence can be aligned against the proteins contained in

the database using the BLAST program. Matches to the
sequence can then be used as an entry into the cluster in
which they belong. Alternatively, a similarity search can
be performed directly against the Hidden Markov Models
(HMMs) generated from the MSA of the clusters using the
HMMER [21] program. Once a match has been made, the
user can easily download either the raw fasta file of the
cluster or the MSA file to create a tree incorporating the
new sequence.

Synteny maps
These analyses produce sets of true, one-to-one orthologs,
and this presentation incorporates a view of their relative
physical positions across multiple genomes. As opposed
to other methods that rely on sequence similarity to create
comparative genome alignments, this avoids confusion
that arises from paralogy. Synteny maps are generated by
selecting a genomic span from a single reference genome
and one or more query genomes to align (Figure 4). All
identified orthologous genes between the selected
genome and each of the query genomes are shown.

Discussion and conclusion

Authors' contributions

The rapidly increasing number of sequenced genomes
allows us to study genes and genomes within an evolutionary context. Not only does this assist in the transfer of
annotations between genes, but also allows us to uncover
how the forces of evolution have shaped each genome.
The PhIGs database project seeks to facilitate comparative
genomic, phylogenomic, and functional genomic studies
by providing a comprehensive resource for the determination of the evolutionary history for all genes from the fully
sequenced genome projects. The two main properties that
differentiate the PhIGs database from other clustering
methods are the use of the known evolutionary relationships of the species to create gene clusters representing the
descendants of a single ancestral gene and the creation of
a complete phylogenetic gene tree of the cluster members
using widely accepted analytic methods of molecular evolution. By combining this phylogenetic information with
functional annotation, gene structure, genomic position
and other datasets, the PhIGs database will prove to be a
valuable resource for all fields of biology currently using
genomic data.

Both authors conceived and designed the project. PSD did
all of the programming and implementation. Both
authors wrote and approved the final manuscript.

The scientific applications of the PhIGs database are
broad, extending beyond practical genome annotation
and analysis. For instance, obvious applications are the
use of orthogous gene clusters for: (1) organismal phylogenetic reconstruction; (2) the study of genome evolution
by gene duplication; (3) gene structure evolution through
the gain and loss of exons, introns, and domains; (4) the
identification of gene family expansions and losses and 5)
genome evolution. The PhIGs analyses have already been
used to compare specifically the whole genomes of a tunicate, fish, mouse, and human, demonstrating that the relative positions in the human genome of paralogs
generated by duplications at the base of vertebrates provide clear evidence in favor of the contentious hypothesis
of two rounds of whole genome duplication having
occurred at the base of the vertebrates, and perhaps providing the raw material for vertebrate complexity [22].
Further applications can be developed to meet other analytical needs of the scientific community.
Future development includes improvements to the underlying clustering method, incorporation of more annotation data, creation of more analysis tools and more rapid
updates of newly available genomes. The functionality of
the PhIGs database is currently accessible though the web
interface and data files of orthology relationships for
download. Our goal is to convert this into an open source
project to help maintain and expand this as a resource for
the scientific community.
