Abstract
Background: Gonorrhea is a major sexually transmitted disease (STD) in many countries worldwide. The
emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance has complicated efforts to control and treat this disease. We report the
first study of the evolutionary processes acting on transmission dynamics of a resistant gonococcal population
from Shanghai, China. We compare these findings with our previous study of the evolution of a fluoroquinolone
sensitive gonococcal population from Baltimore, MD.
Methods: Ninety six gonococcal samples were collected from male patients in Shanghai, China. All samples were
fluoroquinolone resistant. Seven MLST housekeeping genes, two fluoroquinolone resistance genes (gyrA and parC)
and the porB gene were sequenced and subjected to population genetic and evolutionary analyses. We estimated
genetic diversity, recombination, growth, and selective pressure. The evolutionary history and population dynamics
of the Shanghai population were also inferred and compared with that observed in a fluoroquinolone sensitive
gonococcal population from Baltimore.
Results: For both populations, mutation plays a larger role than recombination in the evolution of the porB gene,
whereas the latter seems to be the main force driving the evolution of housekeeping and fluoroquinolone
resistance genes. In both populations there was evidence for positively selected sites in all genes analyzed. The
phylogenetic analyses showed no temporal clustering in the Shanghai gonococcal population, nor did we detect
shared allelic profiles between the Shanghai and the Baltimore populations. Past population dynamics of
gonococcal strains from Shanghai showed a rising relative effective population size (Ne) in MLST genes with a
declining relative Ne for gyrA and parC, whereas among sensitive strains from Baltimore we previously observed
concordance among these genes. In both Shanghai and Baltimore, the past population dynamics of gonococcal
strains tracked changes in the prevalence of gonorrhea.
Conclusions: Our study illustrates both similarities and differences in the evolutionary processes acting on
gonococcal populations in different geographic areas. An explanation of this pattern that may apply in China is the
continued use of quinolone antibiotics despite widespread resistance. Population genetic analysis of gonococcal
strains in conjunction with epidemiological surveillance may provide insights into the epidemic behavior of
antibiotic resistant strains and help to design control measures.

Background
Gonorrhea is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a gramnegative aerobic diplococcus, and remains a major sexually transmitted disease (STD) in many countries worldwide [1-4]. The high prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae in
developing countries and in some subpopulations in
developed countries is related to poor accessibility to

diagnostic tests and appropriate treatments [1,5].
Furthermore, inappropriate use of antibiotics has led to
the development of resistant strains, although the prevalence of drug resistance varies greatly among countries
[6-11]. The emergence of resistance to antimicrobial
agents in gonococci represents a major challenge for
public health control strategies in both developing and
developed countries [4,12]. In fact, gonorrhea has proven difficult to control and remains a prime example of
the influence that social, behavioral, and demographic

factors, as well as microbial factors, can have on the epidemiology of an infectious disease.
In China, gonorrhea represents one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases and the most frequently reported STD in this country [9]. A total of
169,715 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the
national Center for STD Control, CDC, China, in 2005
[13]. Even though the incidence of gonorrhea in this
country is still increasing, population genetic and molecular epidemiologic studies remain limited [6,9,14].
Understanding the patterns of genetic diversity in
microbial populations represents an important step for
public health control strategies [15,16]. In fact, the characterization of the sources of such heterogeneity in
these populations is relevant for the design of targeted
treatment strategies. Previous population genetic studies
of N. gonorrhoeae pointed out the role of recombination,
mutation and selective pressures as driving forces for
the evolution of this pathogen [10,17-19].
In order to understand the evolutionary processes acting on N. gonorrhoeae transmission dynamics in a community with a high incidence of gonorrhea, such as
Shanghai, China, we estimated genetic diversity, recombination, growth, and selective pressure for the porB,
seven housekeeping genes that constitute an MLST
(MultiLocus Sequence Typing) scheme, and fluoroquinolone resistance genes from 96 Shanghai gonococcal
isolates. We also inferred the evolutionary history and
population dynamics of this population over the last 40
years. Finally, we compared the demographics of N.
gonorrhoeae in Shanghai to that observed in another
high incidence area, Baltimore, MD, USA [19]. In
Shanghai, during the period of our study, gonorrhea
incidence was 75 to 107 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants [20], while in Baltimore it was reported as 180
new cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 2005 [21]. However, in contrast with the Shanghai population that has
a prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistant gonococci of
98% [6], in Baltimore such strains are still rare [22,23].
This comparative study will therefore allow for inferring
common patterns of evolution and transmission
dynamics between a resistant gonococcal population
from Shanghai and a fluoroquinolone sensitive gonococcal population isolated in Baltimore.

Methods
Isolate collection and genes

96 gonococcal isolates were obtained between February
2001 and October 2005 from male patients seen in
clinics of the Shanghai Skin Disease and STD Hospital.
The epidemiological information for these isolates is
presented in Additional file 1, Table S1. All the isolates
were fully resistant to fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the ethical

Page 2 of 12

committee of the Shanghai Skin Disease and STD Hospital. All patients participating in the study gave oral
informed consent.
Genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA
Mini Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. Partial regions of seven core housekeeping genes fumC, gdh, glnA, gnd, pilA, pyrD, and
serC [18,24], partial regions of gyrA and parC, which
encompass the fluoroquinolone resistance-determining
regions, and a fragment of the porB gene (PIA and PIB)
were amplified by PCR and sequenced as described previously [19].
Genetic analyses

In order to increase phylogenetic and statistical signal,
the seven housekeeping gene fragments and the two
fluoroquinolone resistance gene fragments were separately concatenated into two sequences for each isolate,
providing a total of 288 DNA sequences for analysis,
including 96 housekeeping gene sequences, 96 fluoroquinolone resistance gene sequences, 24 PIA sequences
and 72 PIB sequences. The sequences were first translated into amino-acids using the universal genetic code
in MacClade 4.05 [25], and then aligned using MAFFT
[26]. Amino-acid sequences were then backtranslated
into DNA sequences and used for our genetic analyses.
Unique sequences were deposited in GenBank under
accession numbers EU796227 to EU796257 and
EU796259 to EU796357.
Gene phylogenies were estimated using maximum
likelihood analyses [27] with nodal support assessed via
bootstrapping (1,000 pseudoreplicates) [28], as implemented in PHYML [29]. Gene phylogenies were also
assessed using Bayesian methods [30] coupled with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) inference, as implemented in MrBayes v3.1.2 [31]. Model selection for
these analyses followed the procedure outlined by
Posada and Buckley [32], as implemented in ModelTest
v3.6 [33] using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).
The substitution model GTR+Γ+I was selected for the
housekeeping genes and the fluoroquinolone resistance
genes as the best-fit model of molecular evolution. The
models of molecular evolution chosen for PIA and PIB
groups were GTR+I and HKY+Γ+I, respectively. For the
BMCMC techniques, two independent analyses were
run each consisting of four chains. Each Markov chain
started from a random tree and ran for 2.0 × 107 cycles,
sampling every 1000th generation. In order to confirm
that our Bayesian analyses converged and mixed well,
we monitored the likelihood scores and compared
means and variances of all likelihood parameters and
likelihood scores from the independent runs using the
program Tracer v1.4 [34].
Evolutionary relationships among the different genes
were also assessed using the method of statistical

Tazi et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:13
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/13

parsimony [35], as implemented in the software package
TCS v1.21 [36]. TCS networks were constructed so that
the solid squares (putative outgroups) and solid circles
represent actual sequences derived from the strains analyzed. The size of the colored squares and circles is proportional to the number of sequences displaying the
same genotype. Each open circle represents putative
sequences in the evolutionary pathway. The solid lines
on a network represent mutational connections among
unique genotypes with at least a 95% degree of confidence, whereas the dashed lines represent a more tenuous connection (P < 0.95).
In addition to phylogenetic and network reconstruction approaches, the FST fixation index, as implemented
in ARLEQUIN v3.1 [37], was estimated to test for temporal structuring of the gonococcal population. P values
below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Genetic diversity (θ), recombination rates (r), and
growth rates (g) were estimated for each set of genes
using the maximum likelihood coalescent approach
implemented in LAMARC v2.0.2 [38]. Three independent runs were performed for each gene in order to
assess the reproducibility of the different parameter estimates. Furthermore, an estimate of the relative contribution of recombination (C) to genetic diversity was
obtained by multiplying r and θ [39].
The impact of natural selection was inferred by estimating the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (ω = dN/dS) per site and per gene using the
codon-based nested models M1 (neutral)/M2 (selection),
and M7 (beta)/M8 (beta and ω), as implemented in the
PAML package v4 [40]. The likelihood of evolution was
therefore compared under models prohibiting (M1, M7)
versus models allowing (M2, M8) positive selection.
Models M2 (three parameters) and M8 (four parameters) extend M1 (one parameter) and M7 (two parameters) by adding a third class of residues with ω > 1.
Model likelihood scores were compared using a Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) to determine the best-fit model.
The Bayes empirical Bayes approach was applied to
identify the potential sites under diversifying selection as
indicated by a posterior probability (pP ≥ 0.95) [41].
The past population dynamics of N. gonorrhoeae in
Shanghai were inferred using the Bayesian skyline plot
model [42], as implemented in BEAST v1.4.6 [43].
BEAST assumes no recombination and we are not
aware of any study testing the robustness of BEAST to
violation of the no recombination assumption. However,
preliminary simulations by our group indicate that
BEAST is indeed robust to levels of recombination similar to those observed in the Shanghai population (Additional file 2, Figure S1). Nonetheless, before performing
our analyses, we searched for recombinant isolates in
our datasets using RDP3 [44]. All algorithms were

Page 3 of 12

considered and applied to estimate the number of
recombination events and no recombinants were
detected in our datasets, presumably due to the shortness of the sequence fragments. Log-normal relaxed
clock evolutionary models were used for our analyses
[45]. Lower and upper limits and mean of the substitution rates were obtained from an extensive N. gonorrhoeae dataset from Baltimore recently analyzed by our
group [19]. The Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) outputs generated by BEAST were analyzed
using Tracer v1.4 [34].
Recent evolutionary relationships among the housekeeping gene sequences were analyzed using the
eBURST algorithm implemented at http://eburst.mlst.
net/[46]. Unique alleles for each of the seven housekeeping genes were given a numerical identifier and isolates
with identical allelic profiles were assigned the same
sequence type (ST) number. Groups of STs were defined
as a clonal complex if they shared at least five of seven
alleles.

Results
Among the 96 strains collected in Shanghai between
2001 and 2005, the phylogenies constructed by maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods did not show
any clustering related to the date of isolation (data not
shown). The evolutionary relationships assessed using
network approaches also failed to reveal temporal clustering in this population, as illustrated by the network
reconstruction for the housekeeping genes (Figure 1).
The other genes showed also similar patterns in these
analyses (Additional files 3, 4 and 5, Figures S2-S4). The
quantitative analyses for detecting temporal structuring
(FST analyses) were also not significant for all year comparisons and for all genes analyzed, except for the fluoroquinolone resistance genes in which very few of these
analyses (only 5 among the total 26 analyses for these
genes) showed significant P values. However, after Benferroni correction, among these five significant associations, only one year comparison (2002 - 2005) remains
significant (Additional file 6, Table S2). This finding
suggests therefore no temporal genetic differentiation
between the isolates from Shanghai.
The network reconstructions for all the genes indicated
a high level of genetic diversity among the isolates, with
the greatest diversity observed in the housekeeping
genes. In fact, 85 different genotypes were present in
the housekeeping genes, with almost 90% of the total
genotypes as unique (Figure 1). The networks of the
fluoroquinolone resistance genes and the porB PIA and
PIB genes showed 37, 7, and 40 different genotypes,
respectively (Additional files 3, 4 and 5, Figures S2-S4).
The unique genotypes among the fluoroquinolone resistance genes and the porB PIA and PIB genes comprised

proportional to the number of sequences displaying the same genotype. The open circles represent putative sequences in the evolutionary
pathway. The solid lines on a network represent mutational connections among unique genotypes with at least a 95% degree of confidence,

about 52%, 72%, and 65%, respectively, of the total genotypes in the Shanghai population.
To further assess genetic differences among the strains
collected in Shanghai, we estimated population genetic
parameters, including genetic diversity (θ), recombination (r and C), and growth (g) using LAMARC v2.0.2
for the concatenated housekeeping genes, the concatenated fluoroquinolone resistance genes, and porB gene
(PIA and PIB) (Table 1). We also estimated the population genetic parameters partitioning the genes by date of
collection, with the exception of the PIA sequences due
to the small size of this dataset (Table 1). The PIB
sequences showed higher genetic diversity than the
housekeeping sequences, the PIA sequences or the
fluoroquinolone resistance sequences. Moreover, the
ratio of the per-site rate of recombination to the per-site
rate of mutation (c/μ) in the porB gene indicates that

mutation plays a greater role compared to recombination in the evolution of this gene. On the other hand,
the fluoroquinolone resistance genes showed the highest
recombination rates in comparison to the other genes
(Table 1). In fact, recombination appears to be the main
driving force for the evolution of the housekeeping
genes and the fluoroquinolone resistance genes. The
genetic diversity and recombination rate estimates
showed, in general, similar values, when considering the
partitions by date of collection (Table 1). However, the
fluoroquinolone resistance genes showed a higher
genetic diversity for the samples isolated in 2005. The
estimates of the population genetic parameters for the
individual housekeeping and fluoroquinolone resistance
genes, in general, supported the results from the analysis
of the concatenated genes; however, for some genes the
levels of genetic diversity and recombination were low

(Additional file 7, Table S3). Overall, growth rates (g)
showed high positive values (i.e., exponential growth) in
all genes analyzed, except for PIA sequences where g
showed a negative value (Table 1). This latter result may
reflect a decrease in the expression of PIA alleles in the
Shanghai population. Also, PIA included fewer
sequences (24 isolates) than the housekeeping genes (96
isolates), the fluoroquinolone resistance genes (96 isolates) and the PIB genes (72 isolates), and g estimation
seems to be very sensitive to sample size [38]. The g
values were also positive for each time point and for all
gene partitions.
We also tested for the extent of natural selection in the
Shanghai gonococcal population and found that all
models that allow for positively selected sites (M2 and
M8) suggest the existence of these sites in all the genes
analyzed (Table 2). In fact, all models indicate the presence of a proportion of sites (1.5% - 14%) under very
strong positive selection (10.5 - 75.3). The likelihood
ratio tests comparing models M1 vs M2 and models M7
vs M8 were all significant (P < 0.001). The Bayesian
approach identified 14 positively selected sites (pP ≥
0.95) in the housekeeping genes under model M2 and
15 positively selected sites under model M8. All of the
14 sites detected under model M2 were included in the
15 sites found by model M8. Within the fluoroquinolone resistance genes, models M2 and M8 both detected
the same six positively selected sites. Among these sites

under positive selection, two sites were detected in gyrA
gene whereas the four other sites were detected in parC
gene. In gyrA gene, the two positively selected sites correspond to the sites known to confer resistance to quinolones (Ser-91 ® Phe mutation and Asp-95 ® Ala
mutation). On the other hand, among the four positively
selected sites detected in parC gene, only two sites were
already described as sites conferring resistance to quinolones (sites Ser-87 and Glu-91 with no mutations at
these residues) [6]. For this study, quinolone-resistant N.
gonorrhoeae isolates from Shanghai presented double
mutations of gyrA gene (Ser-91 ® Phe and Asp-95 ®
Ala) combined with no mutation of parC gene, which
corresponds to one of the most predominant patterns
(Pattern P3) already described in another resistant gonococcal population from Shanghai [6]. Four positively
selected sites were found in PIA sequences under models M2 and M8; and in the PIB sequences, 10 and 12
positively selected sites were detected under models M2
and M8, respectively. The 10 sites found under model
M2 were all included in the 12 sites detected under
model M8.
We inferred the past population dynamics of N. gonorrhoeae in Shanghai using the BEAST program. The
population dynamics of the gonococcal population in
Shanghai over the past 40 years inferred from the
housekeeping genes showed that the relative effective
population size (Ne) increased dramatically and steadily

Log-likelihood values and parameter estimates (ω, p, n) of seven concatenated housekeeping genes, two concatenated fluoroquinolone resistance genes, and the
porB gene (PIA and PIB). lnL = Likelihood values; ω = acceptance rate per site (ωM2 and ωM8); p = proportion of sites under diversifying selection (pM2 and pM8); n

significant.

from the early 1980s until 2002 and then leveled off
(Figure 2). The inference made from the porB gene
showed that relative Ne was level until the late 1990s
and subsequently increased sharply from 1997 until
2002 and more slowly since that time. The confidence
limits around the estimate are wide and it cannot be
excluded that the rise began in the early 1990s and has
been much steeper than the estimate derived from the
mean value (Figure 2). In contrast, the fluoroquinolone
resistance genes showed a different scenario for the
population dynamics of N. gonorrhoeae with stable to
slightly increasing relative Ne until 1985 followed by a
sharp decline reaching its minimum size in 2005.
We also compared the Shanghai gonococcal population with that from a previous study we conducted
using isolates from Baltimore, MD. The comparison
between the gonococcal populations isolated in the two
geographical areas showed different population
dynamics over the past 35 years in each of these settings
(Figure 3). Over the past 25 years (from 1980 until
2005), the relative Ne inferred from the housekeeping
genes declined dramatically in Baltimore except for a

resistance genes (green lines), and porB gene (blue lines) with the

transient rise and fall between 1990-1995, whereas it
increased in Shanghai. A different population dynamics
was also observed for the fluoroquinolone resistance
genes in the Baltimore and Shanghai populations over
the past 25 years (Figure 3). Relative Ne was stable in
Baltimore, apart from a slight rise and fall, which paralleled the changes seen for the housekeeping genes in
the 1990-1995 period, while in Shanghai, relative Ne
declined between 1985 and the present, as noted above.
In both populations the changes in relative Ne inferred
from the housekeeping genes tracked trends in the total
number of reported cases of N. gonorrhoeae. Thus, in
Baltimore the general decline in cases from 1975 until
the present corresponded to a decline in relative Ne,
with the exception noted above for the period 19901995. Although reporting for Shanghai is incomplete,
the dramatic increase in reported cases between 1994
and 1998 was reflected in a steep rise in relative Ne during this time period (Figure 3).
Finally, we analyzed recent evolutionary relationships
among the housekeeping gene sequences in the Shanghai gonococcal population using the eBURST algorithm.
The allelic profiles of the 96 isolates were classified into
two groups with 76 STs in group 1 and three STs in
group 2, in addition to six other unlinked STs. In the
eBURST diagram, the three major clonal complexes did
not include the isolates collected during the same period
of time; and the primary founders in two clonal complexes (G793 and G799) were isolated in 2005 (Figure
4-A). The founder ST (G819) for the largest clonal complex was isolated in 2002. For this dataset, the level of
recombination is moderate and the nodes in the largest
clonal complex represent therefore true lines of descent.
The eBURST analysis supports the findings of the phylogenetic and F ST analyses that there is no temporal
genetic differentiation between the isolates from the
Shanghai population. We also compared the Shanghai
and Baltimore populations using this algorithm in order
to detect STs common to both populations. The STs for

Discussion
Fluoroquinolones have been widely used for the treatment of gonorrhea since the 1980s because of their
strong antibacterial efficiency in addition to their lower
cost and the convenience of oral administration. However, resistance to these drugs emerged quickly in many
countries [47-51]. In China, the rate of fluoroquinolone
resistance is very high, reaching even 100% in some
areas[52]. However, these drugs are still used to treat
gonorrhea in this country because all health providers
do not follow official recommendations for antibiotics
administration and antibiotics are widely available without a prescription. Despite the rapid spread of resistant
gonococci in this region, information on population
genetics and epidemiology of N. gonorrhoeae in China
remain limited [6,9,14]. Our study represents the first
study to focus on understanding the evolutionary processes acting on the transmission dynamics of resistant
gonococci in Shanghai.
Our analysis showed that the evolutionary processes
acting on the fluoroquinolone resistant gonococcal
population from Shanghai shared many features with
what we previously described for a fluoroquinolone sensitive population from Baltimore [17-19]. For both

Page 7 of 12

populations, mutation plays a larger role than recombination in the evolution of the porB gene, whereas the
latter seems to be the main force driving the evolution
of the housekeeping and fluoroquinolone resistance
genes [18,19]. While it is clear that recombinational hotspots occur in genomes (e.g., [53]), the causes of such
hotspots remain a mystery [54]. The differences
observed in this study seem to be related to differences
in selection regimes for the different genes in question.
The housekeeping genes are under purifying selection,
which leads to a larger number of synonymous relative
to nonsynonymous substitutions, and would select
against rearrangements due to recombination that
would cause fitness declines. For these genes, recombination would therefore play a larger role in creating
genetic diversity by shuffling synonymous mutations
into novel allelic combinations. The porB gene and
fluoroquinolone resistance genes, on the other hand, are
more likely to be impacted by diversifying selection and
directional selection, respectively. The porB gene undergoes diversifying selection due to its interaction with the
immune system to escape immune detection, and we
can then expect, as observed in our analyses, a high
impact of mutation for generating diversity in this gene.
Interestingly, such selection pressure seems also to lead
to a dominant role for recombination to shuffle existing
variation into novel combinations. The impact of recombination should therefore be incorporated into vaccine
strategies that are centered around the porB gene
[55,56]. The fluoroquinolone resistance genes, on the
other hand, are exposed to directional selection to
acquire substitution changes associated with drug resistance. Apparently, novel combinations produced
through recombination aid also directional selection. In
fact, this evolutionary process appears to be the dominant force relative to mutation for genes under both
directional and diversifying selection. Indeed, the evolution of these genes is analogous to the env and protease
genes (i.e., diversifying selection to avoid immune detection and evolution of drug resistance, respectively) in
HIV where recombination has a major impact [57]. This
interpretation is also supported by the selection analysis
that showed a much higher level in the proportion of
positively selected sites in the fluoroquinolone resistance
genes relative to the housekeeping genes and an increase
in selection in the porB gene as well (Table 2). Indeed,
the porB gene shows an 8-fold increase in the proportion of sites under diversifying selection relative to the
housekeeping genes.
Additionally, in both populations, estimates of growth
rate (g) showed high positive values for all genes with
the exception of PIA sequences. A likely explanation for
the negative value for the PIA sequences is the small
number of sequences included in the analysis since g

estimation seemed to be very sensitive to sample size, as
illustrated by the large confidence interval for this estimate in these sequences. However, it cannot be
excluded that there is a decrease in expression of PIA
alleles in the gonococcal population as the same observation was made in the Baltimore population. The phylogenetic analyses and the network reconstructions
showed no temporal clustering among the Shanghai

strains, similar to our previous findings for the gonococcal population from Baltimore [18]. The population
genetic analyses of the Shanghai isolates showed similar
levels of genetic diversity for time partition, providing
further evidence for the absence of temporal clustering.
One exception was that isolates collected in 2005
showed a higher level of genetic diversity for the fluoroquinolone resistance genes than isolates collected in the

Tazi et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:13

four previous years. Contrary to the Shanghai population, the gonococcal population from Baltimore showed
evidence for temporal clustering in the Baltimore population based on the FST estimates. However, it is important to note that the sampling interval (1 year) and time
span (5 years) of the Shanghai study population were
less than those of the Baltimore study, where isolates
were collected every fifth year over a 15 year time period. This difference in sampling strategy may have limited our ability to detect temporal clustering. However,
it is important to emphasize that the sample size of the
Shanghai population is appropriate and adequate for
generating population genetic estimates [58].
Changes in relative Ne over time represent a valuable
tool for inferring the current and past epidemiology of
infectious diseases. Our analysis of population dynamics
of N. gonorrhoeae over the past 40 years in Shanghai,
inferred from the housekeeping genes, showed that relative Ne has been increasing since the early 1980s with a
leveling off from 2002 until 2005. The inference made
from the porB gene was similar to that observed with
the housekeeping genes. In contrast, the fluoroquinolone
resistance genes showed a declining relative Ne since
1985. The appearance of antibiotic resistant strains
would be predicted to cause a decrease in relative Ne
since a limited number of strains with resistance mutations would have a selective advantage. This expectation
was born out by the BEAST analysis of the fluoroquinolone resistance genes. Additionally, a decrease in relative
Ne estimated from the housekeeping and porB genes
would also be predicted, due to a selective sweep. However, the opposite pattern was observed in this population: relative Ne estimated from these genes increased
(Figure 2). The most likely explanation for this finding
is that fluoroquinolone antibiotics continue to be used
widely in China and their continued use led to rapid
diversification as the resistance genes spread throughout
the gonococcal population. The evolutionary pattern of
a rising relative Ne in housekeeping genes in the presence of a declining relative Ne for resistance genes may
have therefore broad application in clinical practice as
an indication that antibiotics are being misused and the
need for better strategies for managing the resistance.
However, we cannot exclude the possibility that social
and epidemiological factors also contributed to the
increase in relative Ne inferred from the housekeeping
and porB genes. The rise in incidence of gonorrhea in
late 1990s has been mainly attributed to the influx of
people into Shanghai and to economic development
attracting more construction workers from the countryside to that area. This movement of people may have
resulted in the importation of new strains into the city,
fueling the increase in relative Ne. Conversely, the
recent leveling off or decline in relative Ne observed in

Page 9 of 12

our analysis may be related to a concerted effort by the
public health services to prevent and treat new N. gonorrhoeae cases.
The comparative analysis of past population dynamics
of gonococcal populations from Shanghai and Baltimore
revealed significant differences between these populations (Figure 3). Relative Ne inferred from housekeeping
genes declined dramatically in Baltimore over the past
25 years, while relative Ne in Shanghai increased sharply. In both geographic areas, the changes in relative Ne
appeared to largely track changes in the total number of
reported cases of N. gonorrhoeae. The historical patterns
of prevalence of gonorrhea influence therefore deeply its
population dynamics. This finding is indeed reassuring
that the BEAST analysis is robust despite the recombination level detected in this population. We observed
similar trends in relative Ne from housekeeping and
fluoroquinolone resistance genes in our analysis of Baltimore strains, compared to the results from the Shanghai
gonococcal strains. This is not surprising since fluoroquinolone resistance was not reported in Baltimore until
2005 [19,22], and thus gyrA and parC genes were under
the same selective pressure as the housekeeping genes.
The eBURST analysis showed also that the Shanghai
population is very different and unique, compared to
the Baltimore population. No ST was shared between
the two populations. The lack of identical STs shared by
these two populations provides evidence for geographic
structuring of gonococcal populations, as previously
shown in analyses using porB sequences of strains from
different geographic regions [17]. However, phylogenetic
analysis of the combined Shanghai and Baltimore MLST
dataset did not reveal segregation of gonococcal isolates
between the two cities (data not shown). The eBURST
methodology appears, therefore, to have greater sensitivity for identifying recent clonal populations, or at least
applies a much more stringent definition for such populations. This approach emphasizes also the continuous
emergence of resistant strains in Shanghai and the
urgent need for better control and prevention strategies
in this area.

Conclusions
In comparison to our previous study of sensitive gonococcal strains in Baltimore, this population genetic analysis of quinolone resistant strains revealed differences
that may have microbiological and clinical implications.
The more dominant role of recombination compared to
mutation in the evolution of resistant strains raises the
possibility that horizontal gene transfer is an important
mechanism for the acquisition of resistance.
Future studies should investigate potential environmental sources for resistance conferring determinants.
Although quinolone resistance genes function as

housekeeping genes and among sensitive strains the
population dynamics of these genes paralleled that of
the MLST genes, in the resistant population in Shanghai
we found a rising relative Ne in MLST genes in the presence of a declining relative Ne for resistant strains,
indicating continuous diversification of resistant strains
rather than spread of a clonal resistant population. We
speculate that one explanation for this pattern is continued use of an ineffective antibiotic with acquisition of
resistance by strains with novel genotypes. In our previous study of quinolone resistant strains from Israel
[10], we saw a pattern characteristic of the spread of an
epidemic strain with low levels of diversity at all tested
loci. Given these different evolutionary pictures, monitoring the population dynamics of N. gonorrhoeae
strains at MLST and antibiotic resistance loci could
assist in the design of control measures that focus, for
example, on core transmitters in the latter case or on
poorly informed providers in the former scenario. In
this study of gonorrhea in Shanghai as well as our previous study of gonorrhea in Baltimore, we noted that
the pas t population dynamics of gonocooci mirrored
the historical pattern of the prevalence of gonorrhea.
Future prospective studies are needed to see if changes
in population dynamics have predictive value and thus
would assist in the design of control measures.
