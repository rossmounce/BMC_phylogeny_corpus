Abstract
Background: Comparison of completely sequenced microbial genomes has revealed how fluid
these genomes are. Detecting synteny blocks requires reliable methods to determining the
orthologs among the whole set of homologs detected by exhaustive comparisons between each
pair of completely sequenced genomes. This is a complex and difficult problem in the field of
comparative genomics but will help to better understand the way prokaryotic genomes are
evolving.
Results: We have developed a suite of programs that automate three essential steps to study
conservation of gene order, and validated them with a set of 107 bacteria and archaea that cover
the majority of the prokaryotic taxonomic space. We identified the whole set of shared homologs
between two or more species and computed the evolutionary distance separating each pair of
homologs. We applied two strategies to extract from the set of homologs a collection of valid
orthologs shared by at least two genomes. The first computes the Reciprocal Smallest Distance
(RSD) using the PAM distances separating pairs of homologs. The second method groups homologs
in families and reconstructs each family's evolutionary tree, distinguishing bona fide orthologs as well
as paralogs created after the last speciation event. Although the phylogenetic tree method often
succeeds where RSD fails, the reverse could occasionally be true. Accordingly, we used the data
obtained with either methods or their intersection to number the orthologs that are adjacent in
for each pair of genomes, the Positional Orthologous Genes (POGs), and to further study their
properties. Once all these synteny blocks have been detected, we showed that POGs are subject
to more evolutionary constraints than orthologs outside synteny groups, whichever the taxonomic
distance separating the compared organisms.
Conclusion: The suite of programs described in this paper allows a reliable detection of orthologs
and is useful for evaluating gene order conservation in prokaryotes whichever their taxonomic
distance. Thus, our approach will make easy the rapid identification of POGS in the next few years
as we are expecting to be inundated with thousands of completely sequenced microbial genomes.

Background
Comparison of completely sequenced genomes belonging to a wide variety of prokaryotic species has revealed
how fluid these genomes are (for a review, see [1]). For
instance, synteny is rapidly lost [2] as a consequence of
incessant gene flows inside a genome and between species. Moreover, there is frequent gain and loss of genes,
even between various strains of the same species or species
belonging to the same genus (see, for example, [3]). However, a small proportion of orthologous genes, hereafter
called Positional Orthologous Genes (POGs), conserve
their local order even between distantly related species
[4,5]. Such observations gave birth to the concept of
genomic context [6,7]. Accordingly, this rare conservation
of gene order has been interpreted as the signature of
functional relationships between the products of these
stably associated genes [8-14].
Detecting these stable islands in a sea of moving genes is
a complex and difficult problem in the field of comparative genomics. The potential pitfalls increase with the deluge of newly published genome sequences. Several groups
have described these difficulties, the primary one being
reliably determining the orthologs among the whole set of
homologs detected by exhaustive comparisons between
each pair of completely sequenced genomes. Various
strategies have been applied in the past to detect
orthologs. The most popular one has been the so-called
bidirectional best hit method. It is based on BLAST reciprocal-best-hits (RBH) between either a pair [12,15] or a
triplet of genomes [16].
However, it has been shown that BLAST searches often
return as the highest scoring hit a protein that is not the
nearest phylogenetic neighbour of the query sequence
[17]. As a consequence, it has been repeatedly emphasized
that actual orthologs could be missed, including when
using RBH approaches (see for instance [18-20] and references inside). According to Fulton et al. [20] roughly 1 in
10 RBH-predicted rat-mouse orthologs are false positives
(predominantly paralogs) and about 1 in 20 RBH-predicted orthologs for two Pseudomonas species are probably
similarly incorrect. Note however that there is presently
no direct experimental validation of the effects of the
Koski-Golding demonstration on the prediction accuracy
of BLAST reciprocal-best-hits (or even one-way best
matches) approaches.
To alleviate these problems in detection of orthologs, it
seems sounder to use more theoretically consistent
approaches. Wall and coworkers [18,21] have proposed a
new method called RSD (reciprocal smallest distance)
that is based on estimates of evolutionary distance rather
than BLAST scores. Other approaches based on phylogeny
criteria have been proposed for eukaryotic genomes [22-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/237

24], and more recently (as this paper was submitted) for
prokaryotic data [24].
This work used two alternative and complementary
approaches to reliably determine orthologs from the set of
homologous genes detected after an exhaustive genomic
comparison. We first adapted the RSD method [18] to our
pipeline of programs for defining synteny blocks. We then
introduced a new automatic approach for differentiating
between orthologs and paralogs based upon automated
generation of phylogenetic trees for families of homologous genes in prokaryotes. We compare the advantages
and disadvantages of both the RSD and phylogeny
approaches and show that, while neither method alone is
always reliable, their union is giving reasonably complementary data.
This allows to recognize all bona fide POGs and to further
identify all syntenic blocks whatever the phylogenetic distance separating the studied species. Recognizing such
blocks of adjacent genes is essential to study them as
ancient evolutionary units. Indeed, we further showed
using statistical comparisons that some selective pressure
is keeping POGs associated in a large majority of
genomes. We further investigated whether POGs afford a
particular mode of evolution that would be different from
that of other orthologous genes which are free to move
independently.

Results
An outline of our experimental approach
We designed a three-step experimental scheme to find the
conserved syntenic blocks in a large assortment of 107
microorganisms (the complete list is given in Table 1 and
Additional file 1) located at various distances from one
another in the taxonomy space. In step one, we compared
the proteome (i.e. the whole panoply of proteins encoded
by a completely sequenced genome) of each organism
with all other proteomes to identify the full set of homologous proteins they share. In step two, we developed new
approaches for finding valid orthologs among all the
homologs found in a comparison of each genome with all
the others. Step three searches for a minimal conserved
unit, i.e. a pair of POGs that are adjacent in at least two
genomes. After extending these minimal units as far as
possible, it becomes feasible to assess the relative number
and size of synteny blocks in both nearby and distant species.
Collecting homologous genes in 107 microorganisms
In this first step, we compared each organism's proteome
with those of all the others to identify the full set of
homologous proteins they share. Accordingly, we made
5671 comparisons between every pairing of the whole set
of 107 prokaryotic species (93 bacteria and 14 archaea)

listed in Table 1. To ensure that the search for homologs
was both exhaustive and exact, regardless of the taxonomic distances separating the compared species, we used
the DARWIN AllAll program [25,26] to compare each pair
of proteomes. As previously shown [27], the maximum
likelihood approach used by the DARWIN programs efficiently detects in one step all segments of homology,
including those between evolutionarily-distant proteins
[28]. These features are crucial in work such as this that

compares a large number of genomes separated by a wide
range of phylogenetic distances.
An additional advantage of the DARWIN programs is that
the evolutionary distance between similar proteins in species with a common ancestor uses the well-established
PAM units, a PAM unit being defined as the number of
accepted point mutations per 100 residues separating two
sequences [29,30]. The frequency with which any particu-

lar pair of (mutated) amino acids occurs at a given position in two properly-aligned homologous proteins can be
used as a PAM score to evaluate the evolutionary distance
separating the two proteins. Accordingly, as previously
described [27] and detailed in Methods, we applied the
rules proposed by Altschul [31] to define how significant
sequence similarities are. We required that the PAM distance separating a pair of homologs be less than 250 units
and that each segment of homology have a minimal size
of 80 residues. Moreover, in this search for homologs
belonging to syntenic blocks, we further required that the
pair of aligned amino acid sequences extend at least 80%
of the length of the shorter matching protein.
The AllAll homolog search compared each of the 295,608
proteins to the whole set encoded by the 107 prokaryotic
genomes (Table 1). We found that the vast majority
(272,472) of these proteins have at least one homolog in
another microorganism, probably because many compared species have at least one (often very-) close taxonomic relative in the data set (e.g. Escherichia coli and
Salmonella enterica).
Reliable determination of orthologous genes
In this second step, we tried to recognize a reliable set of
orthologs among the full set of 272,472 homologs the
first step had found. As explained in the introduction, this
is not a trivial task; so we compared the results of two
alternative strategies to avoid the pitfalls of applying each
method independently.
(i) Identifying orthologs using a Reciprocal Smallest Distance (RSD)
approach
We used a reciprocal evolutionary distance to avoid the
risks of errors inherent in similar previous approaches
explained in the introduction. We took advantage of specific properties of the DARWIN AllAll program [25,26]
that set it apart from BLAST algorithm. Also, the AllAll
program calculates the PAM evolutionary distances separating homologous genes, retaining the shortest distance
found for each analyzed pair of proteins. These features
made it trivial to determine RSD ortholog pairs in a comparison of two proteomes, using a strategy similar to that

of Wall and coworkers [18,21]. The RSD ortholog pair
between protein a encoded by genome GA and protein b
encoded by genome GB, was the one for which the PAM
distance separating a from b was smaller than that separating a from any other protein encoded by GB and b from
any other protein encoded by GA.
This RSD approach produced a list of 204,792 orthologs
amounting to 69% of the proteins encoded by the 107
genomes studied in this paper. These 204,792 orthologs
form a total of 2,332,248 pairs (Table 2).
However, we found that this one-to-one approach would
miss a significant number of orthologous relationships
when gene duplications arose after a recent speciation
event. Therefore, we developed a second approach based
on phylogenetic analyses that detects these so-called inparalogs [32].
(ii) Identifying orthologs by a phylogenetic approach
This second approach analyses the evolutionary features
of the detected homologous proteins after grouping them
in families. A transitive approach based on a graph algorithm for determining connected components linked the
272,472 homologous proteins into 12,719 families.
Unfortunately, we observed that a few of these families
were enormous, heterogeneous groupings that, in a significant number of cases, consisted of two or more groups of
highly-connected proteins linked by a few probably-spurious edges. Although many of these bridges are indicating a biologically meaningful paralogy, they appear
detrimental to our search for consistent and valid families
required to identify genuine orthologous relationships.
To avoid any disadvantageous groupings of paralogous
families and to reduce the size of too-large and heterogeneous families, we further applied a graph algorithm for
bridge detection, and broke many unwanted bridges (see
Methods). Applying this strategy to the 12,719 transitive
families redistributed all the homologous genes into
13,139 better defined families.

After this step, one extremely large protein "family"
remained. This heterogeneous cluster contained 107,219

members that are mainly hydrophobic proteins such as
transporters and other membrane proteins, including
many (20,607) proteins with unknown function. Such a
huge gathering of disparate proteins is biologically meaningless. Moreover, it was clearly worthless to analyze it by
a tree approach due to its size and complexity (see below,
Figs. 1 and 2). Therefore, we applied the MCL algorithm
[33,34] to break up this huge and heterogeneous cluster.
This left 190,770 homologous proteins that are members
of 21,371 families: 9,405 pairs of proteins (families of size
2) and all the homologous proteins belonging to each of
the remaining 11,964 families of size 3 or larger – including the largest one that contains 350 proteins. After reconstructing a phylogenetic tree for each family, we applied

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/237

an ad hoc algorithm (see Methods and Additional file 2)
to identify the orthologous relationships within each phylogenetic tree, as shown in Fig. 1 and detailed in Methods.
As it has been repeteadly shown, there is no prokaryotic
species tree that is recognized as a consensus. Accordingly,
we used an approach that does not require such a model
tree. Briefly, the treeortho algorithm analyses the leaves of
a midpoint-rooted tree to determining for each node –
whichever its deepness – whether its descendants arose
from a gene duplication (sharing several sequences in the
same species) or a speciation event (no common species).
For instance, the deepest node of the simplified tree in Fig.
1 is viewed as a duplication event (D, black circle) because
the two branches stemming from this node display leaves
that correspond to the same set of species. The descend-

gene duplication D (creating paralogous groups of carbamoyltransferases) and speciation S1 and S2 are identified by a black circle and a gray diamond, respectively. The presence of in-paralogs is shown by thick branches leading to leaves corresponding to
genes belonging to the same species.

Phylogenetic tree showing pros and cons of both ortholog detection methods. We used PhyML [59] to reconstruct

obtained when listing the orthologs of the Archaeoglobus fulgidus (O29223_ARCFU) and the Bacillus subtilis (CHEC_BACSU)
sequences respectively. Orthologs found by the RSD approach are indicated by a star, those detected with the phylogeny
approach by black triangles, and those found by both methods with a chevron. All nodes are supposed to correspond to speciation events except those labeled with a black dot, which are assumed to be due to gene duplication events.

that they have two thirds of their predictions in common,
namely 67% of the RSD orthologs and 69% of the phylogeny ones, respectively.

Probing all the family trees that we could analyze by this
method recovered a total of 190,770 proteins that have an
ortholog in at least one another species. In total, this phylogeny approach yielded a total of 2,255,324 orthologous
pairs (Table 2).

Fig. 2 shows a tree which illustrates the pros and cons of
both approaches. Family 4565 groups chemotaxis proteins CheC in different Euryarchaeota, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, one Actinobacteria and Thermotoga maritima.
Consider first the search for the orthologs of the B. subtilis
CheC protein (CHEC_BACSU). The RSD approach finds
only 14 orthologs (indicated with a star in the table), discarding the paralogs present in Thermococcus kodakarensis,
Pyrococcus abyssi and the halophilic archaea Haloarcula and
Halobacterium (thick branches). The phylogeny approach

(iii) Comparing the RSD and phylogenetic approaches
Table 2 summarizes the results obtained with the two
approaches. Although the total number of orthologous
pairs obtained by both methods is similar, it is striking

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/237

detects all these in-paralogs, going up to 21 retained proteins (indicated with a triangle). Thus, in this case the phylogeny approach appears to be far more efficient, as
expected.

when analysing the 1011 trees of medium complexity
containing only orthologs and in-paralogs and the 4675
trees of high complexity that contain in- and out-paralogs,
as well as orthologs.

Let's take now the search for the orthologs of the CheC
protein in Archaeoglobus fulgidus (O29223_ARCFU). Here
the RSD approach finds 15 orthologs (indicated with a
star), and the phylogeny approach 14 (triangles) but only
7 (indicated with a chevron) are found by both
approaches. By definition, seven paralogs present in the
different archaeal species (e.g. Q5V4K4_HALMA, the
product of the cheC1 gene in Halobacterium marismortui)
were excluded by the RSD approach but included in the
harvest of the phylogeny approach after identification of
the nodes corresponding to a duplication event (black
dots) and those corresponding to a speciation event.
However, the presence in the dataset of two different
sequences (Q8TLH1_METAC, the product of the cheC1
gene and Q8TUQ3_METAC, the product of the cheC2
gene) for the same organism (M. acetivorans) led the
treeortho algorithm to identify as a gene duplication node
(arrow) the separation between the two subtrees containing the respective M. acetivorans sequences. As a consequence, all the nine descendents of the ancestral copy that
led to the M. acetivorans cheC2 sequence were excluded
from the phylogenetic tally (indicated in gray in the table
of Fig. 2) as corresponding to a paralogy event. These
descendants are found by the RSD approach because there
are only one remaining copy in ARCFU (CheC1) and one
remaining copy (CheC2) in each of the seven different
bacteria branching in the CheC2_METAC subtree. Note
that the ancestral cheC duplication appears rather ancient
as shown in a tree containing all archaeal cheC sequences
and rooted with a few bacterial homologs (see Additional
file 3). The two copies have been separated by at least
three speciation events, the cheC2 copy having highly
diverged (note its branch length) and appearing now
more similar to a group of bacterial cheC. This large divergence is further underlined by the respective gene context
of both copies of cheC. Although, there was an ancestral
duplication of the whole operon, we found that the adjacency cheD1 – cheC2 is conserved in the various phylogenetically close bacteria (adjacency cheD – cheC in Thermus
thermophilus, Geobacter sulfurreducens, Oceanobacillus iheyensis, Bacillus halodurans, and B. subtilis). On the contrary,
gene cheC1 is found adjacent to cheA1 in M. acetivorans as
it is in the other Euryarchaeota.

(iv) Combining data obtained with the RSD and phylogenetic
approaches
Both approaches, thus, yield incomplete data. The union
of both result sets provides a total of 3,014,995 pairs of
orthologs (Table 2). Because of the potential for confusion from the false positives returned by both methods, it
must be noted that their intersection left 1,572,577 pairs
of orthologs that are endowed with a high degree of confidence that they are genuine. However, such a stringent
filtering removes all in-paralogs.

Such correct algorithmic interpretations that lead to reject
RSD orthologs as being actual paralogs probably explain
many of the cases of sequences that are discarded by phylogeny but recovered by RSD. Such instances could not
occur in the 6278 low-complexity trees that are made
uniquely of orthologs, without paralogs, but may happen

Identifying pairs of adjacent orthologous genes
Given the lists of bona fide orthologs, our third step is to
determine how many form reciprocal pairs of strictly adjacent genes in at least two genomes. We found that the
most efficient and rapid way to collect all these pairs was
the following strategy. We stored all the data obtained
from the comparison of the 5671 pairs of genomes in a
relational database SynteBase (see Additional file 3) and
we designed a specific SQL request (see Methods) to query
SynteBase to detect the quadruplets of proteins containing
two pairs of orthologs that are encoded by genes which
are adjacent in both genomes. Table 2 shows that we
detected 290,108 synteny blocks of size 2 with the RSD
method and 302,468 ones with the phylogenetic analysis.
The slight excess of synteny blocks found by the phylogeny approach is probably due to the detection of remote
homologs in families that could not be found in RSD
pairs due to our initial alignment threshold. This is most
probably the case, for instance, of the CheC sequences
encoded by Shewanella oneidensis (Q8EE44_SHEON) and
Vibrio cholerae (Q9KT22_VIBCH) which are not detected
by RSD but found by tree analysis as orthologs of B. subtilis CheC (Fig. 2). Table 2 further shows that we get more
pairs of orthologs with RSD but fewer blocks of synteny,
underlining that some RSD-orthologs are most probably
ancient paralogs (pseudoorthologs). Summing all data
obtained with both methods provides a total of 377,256
blocks of two adjacent orthologs (Table 2).

Finally, we attempted to extend the detected neighbourhood relationships to larger syntenic blocks. The quadruplets, stored in SynteBase, were analyzed with synblock, an
algorithm we designed to map the synteny blocks of size
2 and to merge those that share a common pair of orthologous genes. Note that, in this work where we aim to find
out the conserved blocks of genes that reflect the ancestral
gene order, we required strict gene adjacency, forbidding
any insertion in a synteny block of a gene which would be
unique to one of the pairs of compared genomes.

Table 2 shows that the respective numbers of larger blocks
were 182,289 for the RSD approach and 186,744 for the
phylogenetic analysis. After summing data from both
methods, we got a total of 235,519 synteny blocks. Note
that the average size of these blocks is 2.60 genes per block
(2.59 for the RSD ones and 2.62 for the phylogeny ones,
respectively). These data confirm how fluid prokaryotic
genomes are when they are studied at any taxonomic distance.
We further used these data entered into SynteBase to make
some statistical studies on the respective level of conservation of neighbourhood and other evolutionary features
linked to gene order.

Assessing the evolution rates of positional orthologous
genes
Measuring the distribution of the PAM distances in the taxonomic
space
The PAM distance that separates two orthologs in various
pairs of genomes was used to compare the rate of evolution of different classes of orthologs with different
respects. First, Fig. 3A shows the distribution of the PAM
distances separating orthologous pairs when comparing
E. coli with closely related Enterobacteriaceae S. enterica,
the Firmicute B. subtilis, the member of the Bacteroidetes/
Chlorobi group Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and the
archaeon M. acetivorans. As expected, this distribution is
very dependent of the taxonomic proximity between species. This is confirmed in Fig. 3B and Table 3 that display

the taxonomic distributions of the mean of the PAM distances separating pairs of orthologs and of the total
number of orthologous pairs in the different genomic
comparisons.
Table 3 summarizes the data obtained when comparing
the model organism E. coli with various bacteria and
archaea separated from it by increasing ranks of the taxonomy hierarchy such as family, order, class, phylum and
Domain, respectively. Such comparisons show that the
mean PAM distance separating the orthologs of E. coli
from those of other organisms increases rapidly when
moving far away in the taxonomic space from family to
class ranks. Although this was expected, we observed that
these separating distances were not unbounded, reaching
a plateau value of around 120 PAM units when comparing
the different bacterial phyla and around 140 PAM units
when comparing Domains Bacteria and Archaea. Table 3
further shows that the size of conserved synteny blocks
also depends on the phylogenetic (taxonomic) distance
between species. Indeed, the mean maximum synteny
block size is nearly 3.5 genes when comparing two closely
related bacteria such as the Enterobacteriaceae E. coli and
Salmonella enterica, but goes down to the minimal size of
2 when comparing a bacterium (E. coli) and an archaeon
(M. acetivorans), although these genomes encode a similar
range of proteins. Likewise, the longest synteny block is
only 3 when comparing domains Bacteria and Archaea,
but goes up to around 9 when comparing organisms of
the same class or phylum, and around 11 within the same
order. The longest block for the two studied Enterobacteriaceae contains 20 adjacent genes. The record up to now
is 30 adjacent genes for the pair B. subtilis – B. halodurans
(see Additional file 5).

Measuring the evolution rates of the different classes of orthologous
genes
Table 3 shows that the evolutionary distance separating
POGs levels off at less than 150 PAM units, even for
extremely distant species. This suggests that some strong
constraint is exerted on the evolution of these peculiar
genes. To check this evolutionary model, we further compared the PAM distance distributions for orthologous
genes located either inside synteny blocks (the so-called
POGs) or outside these blocks. Fig. 4 shows that the PAM
distances appear to always be less inside than outside the
synteny blocks. This difference (summarized in Fig. 4C)
appears to be independent of the taxonomic distance separating species, since we observe it as well for the E. coli/S.
enterica pair (Fig. 4A) as the E. coli/B. subtilis pair (Fig. 4B).
This is confirmed by Table 4, which displays the mean
PAM distances between POGs and non-POGs for the set
of species already analyzed in Fig. 3 and Table 3. In all
cases, the PAM distances are shorter inside the blocks than
outside, even though there are fewer and fewer of these
synteny blocks as the taxonomic distance separating species increases.

To check if the observed difference between the PAM distances separating orthologous genes located inside and
outside synteny blocks (Fig. 4 and Table 4) is statistically
significant for any pair of species, we further tested the
whole set of compared genomes, using a bootstrap sampling approach as detailed in Methods. The null hypothesis (H0) assumes that proteins encoded by POGs evolve at
the same evolutionary rate as those encoded by orthologous genes located outside the synteny blocks. The alternative hypothesis (H1) assumes that the proteins encoded
by orthologous genes located inside synteny blocks evolve
more slowly than the proteins encoded by orthologous
genes located outside synteny blocks.

RSD and phylogeny approaches, the overwhelming
majority of the statistical tests reject the null hypothesis
H0 in favour of H1. We found that the remaining, untested
cases (NT) correspond to a few comparisons that are too
small to be safely used in this bootstrap test. This is the
case, for example, of all comparisons (1% of the total)
involving Nanoarchaea equitans, an archaeon with a very
small genome that is also very distant from all other species, including the other archaea.
We conclude that there is a universal trend in the evolution of prokaryotic genomes: genes located in regions
with preserved gene order (POGs) evolve more slowly
than genes found outside.

Discussion
As soon as several prokaryotic genome sequences were
completed, it became clear that very few of their genes had
retained their local ordering through evolution. This
observation was reinforced as more and more genomes
belonging to a wide spectrum of organisms – from very
close to very distantly-related – were published. This led
to the concept of gene (genomic) context [7-14,35]. As we

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/237

prepare to be inundated by thousands of completely
sequenced genomes in the next few years [36], it becomes
urgent to design a strategy for quickly evaluating the conservation of gene order in newly-published genomes,
comparing them to all those already analyzed.
This paper describes a suite of programs (summarized in
Table 5) that automate all the essential steps for evaluating gene order conservation in prokaryotes, as well as presenting some results from their initial application. After
identifying in step 1 (Table 5) the whole set of homologs
shared by 107 prokaryotic species (Table 1), we designed
two independent strategies (steps 2a to 2e) to extract from
this set the collection of orthologs that are shared by at
least two genomes. In a third step (3a and 3b), we located
the positional orthologous genes (POGs) in this collection, and we studied the specific properties that distinguish them from other orthologs.
Correctly identifying positional orthologs
This is a crucial step, because mixing paralogs and
orthologs can lead to errors in predicting ortholog pairs
that seriously compromise studies of the mode of evolu-

tion of genes and genomes. This is especially true when
studying prokaryotes. We already showed [27,28,37] that
many gene families stem from ancestral gene duplication
events that occurred well before the divergence of presentday species. Therefore, orthologs are often more similar
between closely related species, allowing them to be distinguished from paralogs. However, when we compare
genomes belonging to distant species, the difference in
percent identity between orthologs and paralogs falls rapidly (see [28] for a detailed analysis), and the risk of confusing errors quickly increases.
Although there is a long history of research on identifying
orthologs, this is an extremely active research area at the
moment (for a review, see [38]). Numerous papers
appeared within months, each one claiming to present the
"best method" (see, for instance, [5,19-21,39-45]). A consensus does seem to be emerging about the superiority of
approaches based on evolutionary studies over best bidirectional BLAST hits (see, however, the recent work of
Duthil et al. [46] about the specific case of fungi). Anyhow, the fact that so many "best methods" were published
in a single year clearly underlines that the field is immature.
Because no single approach is superior in all cases, our
work applies two alternative and complementary techniques, Reciprocal Smallest Distance (RSD) and phylogenetic approaches. Both approaches are based on wellestablished PAM evolutionary distances, computed by a
maximum likelihood approach [25,26]. Using these PAM
distances allows directly determining the ortholog pairs
separated by RSD, comparing each homolog with all others by means similar to the method already proposed by
Wall et al. [18]. In our 107 genomes, this method identified 204,792 orthologs (69% of the total compared proteins) forming 2,332,248 pairs.
We expected that the phylogeny approach would systematically increase these figures; since it should collect not
only all pairs of orthologs found by RSD but also so-called
in-paralogs [32] the RSD approach misses. In fact, this

does happen in many cases. For example, as Fig. 2 shows
for orthologs of the B.subtilis chemotaxis CheC protein,
we increase the number from 14 found using the RSD
approach to 21 with the phylogeny approach. Unfortunately, although this phylogeny strategy was found to be
quite effective, it can create unexpected difficulties when
comparing many protein sequences that form some heterogeneous and very large "families". In fact, these huge
agglomerates contained about the half of all found
homologs. We managed to decompose many of these into
more valid and much smaller families. However, this
decomposition step caused the loss of a significant
number of genuine pairs of orthologs.
On the other hand, phylogenetic analysis is advantageous
when it rejects a significant number of homologous pairs
that have been found as orthologs by the RSD approach,
as being actual paralogs. This will occur for instance when
a deep node is correctly viewed as due to an ancestral gene
duplication event (Fig. 2). Moreover, the apparent excess
of pairs of orthologs found by the RSD method (Table 2)
looks suspicious; since a significant number of them are
discarded when looking at the number of POGs found by
this approach. Therefore, it seems that phylogeny
approach is more accurate to detect bona fide orthologs,
excluding pseudoorthologs (actual paralogs that appear
to be orthologous due to differential lineage-specific gene
loss) and including in-paralogs.
However, it appears presently hazardous to choose a single "best method" to identify orthologs. Our present strategy has been to combine the results of our two alternative
methods. Uses of the data fall between two possible
options extremes: using the union and using the intersection of their results. Where the goal is to collect a maximum of putative synteny cases in the maximum number
of genomes, it is appropriate to merge the orthologs determined by both methods. Alternatively, if the goal is to
work with pairs of orthologs that are highly likely to be
authentic, it would be best to use only the results that are
common to both approaches, but such an intersection
will unfortunately remove all in-paralogs.

Evolutionary constraints on POGs
Based upon these identified synteny blocks and the computed (PAM) evolutionary distances separating the proteins encoded by these adjacent genes (Fig. 3), it was
possible to compare the rates of evolution of the orthologous genes located inside and outside synteny blocks,
respectively. As shown in Table 4 and Figs. 4 and 5, proteins encoded by genes located within synteny blocks are
found to evolve at a lower rate than those encoded by
genes located outside these blocks.

This observed difference appears to be consistent with the
concept of genomic context in which it is assumed that
neighboring genes are under a strong evolutionary pressure to maintain their adjacency. Such a pressure would
exist, for example, if the proteins they encode have to
interact in order to participate to the same biological process. However, in most cases it is not yet clear what the
actual cause of low evolutionary rate is.
Our demonstration that POGs are more evolutionarily
constrained than other orthologs that do not reside in
synteny blocks confirms and extends the previous observation made by Dandekar et al.[8] that "the degree of
sequence conservation is on average substantially higher
than that in genes that do not exist as conserved genes
pairs". Moreover, our demonstration agrees with both the
variables and universals (namely essentiality, expression
level, and connectivity) that have previously been associated with differences in protein evolutionary rates (for a
recent review, see [47]). We expect that persistently adjacent genes result from several of these universals: (i) they
are probably essential since they are conserved in large
parts (if not all) of the taxonomic space. (ii) They will be
co-transcribed (whether or not they are part of an operon)
at the same level of expression. (iii) In many cases, their
products will interact in the cell, requiring a significant
level of connectivity between them and strict conservation
of residues to permit a sufficient density of structural and
functional contacts.
We performed a preliminary evaluation of these hypotheses using experimental data obtained from the model
organisms E. coli and B. subtilis. Of the 204 POGs shared
by these two species, 53 (26%) are essential E. coli genes,
130 non-essential and 21 unknown. Moreover, 102 of the
shared E. coli and B. subtilis POGs (50% of the total 204)
belong to the E. coli interactome and 47 of these are essential genes (89% of the 53 essential genes). In total, around
23% of the 204 POGs E. coli shares with B. subtilis are both
essential and part of its interactome, making them what
have been called hub proteins [48].
The different data obtained in this work suggest that
blocks of adjacent POGs which display conserved co-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/237

occurence in various present-day genomes can be interpreted as ancient evolutionary units that have resisted
over the years to the imperious fluidity forces. Thus, these
evolutionary units could be viewed as the remnants of the
skeleton of the gene order found in a common ancestor to
all compared present-day microorganisms.
We further propose that POGs have a low evolutionary
rate because they are constituents of functional modules
as previously defined by Hartwell et al.[49] in a systems
biology perspective (for a recent review, see [50]). Being a
part of such modules would require a coordinated evolution between their sequence and expression level to participate in a collective cell function.

Conclusion
Maintaining the order of genes whose products interact in
the same cell function is clearly beneficial to organisms,
for instance to allow co-expression and co-regulation.
This requires the creation of clusters that have low recombination rates (according to Fisher [51]) and that the adjacency of functionally related genes is maintained by
epistatic selection [52]. However, as we compare species
that are distant in the taxonomy space, there is an inverse
relation between taxonomic proximity and the size of the
synteny blocks. This evidence agrees with Poyatos and
Hurst [53] contention that gene order is forever in flux.
Therefore, the exceptional instances where a stable gene
order is conserved, even for a few gene pairs, implies
strong selective pressure that should be reflected in high
levels of co-expression of essential products such as one
sees, for instance, in the exemplary case of ribosomal proteins.

Methods
Comparing protein sequences
The whole set of translated coding sequences (proteome)
obtained for completely sequenced genomes is first
imported from GenBank or EMBL databanks. A Perl script
extracts the following information for each protein of
each genome: a protein identification number, the species
name, the gene name, the length of the protein and its
sequence. The script produces output in a SGML format
required to perform homology search using the DARWIN
3.0 package [25,26].

Their DARWIN AllAll program searches a protein database for homologs using a maximum likelihood
approach. We have adapted this AllAll program to our
own use ([27], see also [54]). It uses a two-step procedure
[25,26]. First, it applies a dynamic programming algorithm [55] with a PAM 250 substitution score matrix [30].
In this first step, the introduction of gaps is strongly discouraged by penalties computed as a function of the PAM
distance separating the two sequences [56]. Then, in a sec-

Page 14 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:237

ond step, each alignment is refined using two other tools.
The first tool attempts to extend the initial alignment as
far as possible using the Smith and Waterman algorithm
[57]. The second tool recalculates the initial substitution
score matrix using the current data set of proteins, and the
process is repeated. The optimization process is monitored by computing the variance of the PAM distance.
When it cannot be decreased further, the alignment is registered as the optimal one for the two proteins studied.
To detect distant homologs, we applied as already
described [27] the rules proposed by Altschul [31]: a pair
of homologs was retained only if they were separated by a
distance less than 250 PAM units, and if each segment had
a minimal size of 80 residues. Because this work focuses
on orthologs belonging to synteny blocks, we further kept
only the pairs of homologs where the alignment extended
for at least 80% of the length of the shorter matching protein.
Detecting orthologs by the RSD approach
Our Reciprocal Smallest Distance (RSD) approach takes
advantage of specific properties of the DARWIN package
[25,26]. Since AllAll program calculates the evolutionary
distance separating homologous genes in PAM units and
keeps the shortest distance for each analyzed pair of proteins, it was trivial to determine the best reciprocal-distance ortholog pairs in a comparison of two proteomes.
Protein a encoded by genome GA and protein b encoded
by genome GB are the best pair of orthologs only if the
PAM distance separating a from b was smaller than that
separating either a from any other protein encoded by GB
and b from any other protein encoded by GA. We automated this search (Table 5, step 2a).
Grouping homologs in consistent families
We used a two-step strategy for grouping the homologs
into families. First, we grouped all homologs transitively,
using a graph algorithm for detecting connected components. Step 2b (see Table 5) automatically gathers into
one family all homologs that are related by a chain of similarities, collecting all relatives of both members of each
pair until no further pairwise relationship is found.

Unfortunately, transitive grouping created many large,
heterogeneous pseudo-families in which quite different
closely-related protein groups were linked together by a
single spurious edge, where one protein belonging to the
first group appeared similar enough to one protein of the
other group to form an apparent pair, which then transitively linked the two dissimilar groups into one family.
Since this was clearly undesirable, we applied a second
graph algorithm (implemented in a Perl graph library) for
"bridge detection" (Table 5, step 2c). In graph theory, a
bridge is defined as an edge whose removal disconnects

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/237

the graph in two subclusters; removing such bridges
allowed us to obtain much more homogeneous and correct families. In a third step (Table 5, step 2d), we broke
additional unwanted links by applying the MCL (Markov
Cluster) algorithm [33] to a very large aggregate of related
homologs. MCL was used with an inflation value of 3.
Reconstructing evolutionary trees for families of homologs
After assembling the families and filtering them for consistency as described above, we aligned their homologous
sequences using the MUSCLE program [58]. Then, we
processed these multiple alignments with a maximum
likelihood approach to reconstruct the phylogeny of the
corresponding family, using the PhyML software [59].
Analyzing evolutionary trees to identify orthologs
Each tree is examined by treeortho, an algorithm (see Additional file 2) that examines each node (Table 5, step 2e),
recursively spanning the tree starting from the mid-length
root. As shown on a simple example (Fig. 1), each internal
node, whichever its depth ("age"), is evaluated by analyzing its leaves, the present-day organisms. When the
descendents of a node are in the same species, this node is
interpreted as a gene duplication event (D, black circle).
This is the case for the deepest node in the simplified tree
adapted from a previous work on the evolutionary history
of carbamoyltransferases [60], because the two branches
stemming from this node display leaves that correspond
to the same set of species. This defines two paralogous
groups corresponding to present-day aspartate and ornithine carbamoyltransferases respectively. However, each
time the descendents of a node are in separate species, it
is a speciation event (S, gray diamond). Accordingly, it is
possible to identify the sets of leaves that are orthologous
to each other. If a duplication node is found in a proximal
position, the two leaves will correspond to the so-called
in-paralogs [32]. This is the case for genes argF and argI
which appeared specifically in E. coli after the last speciation event. In this case, both in-paralogous proteins will
be included in the set of orthologs.
Creating a relational database for synteny data
The repository for all these data and results is a relational
database we call SynteBase. It is implemented in PostgreSQL 8.1 [61], one of the most advanced open source
databases, installed on a Linux platform. SynteBase is
composed of five tables (see Additional file 4). Two tables
contain primary data extracted from public databanks
(GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ). Table genome holds information
about the 107 studied genomes and table protein contains
information about their 295,608 proteins, such as amino
acid sequence, length, species name, location of encoding
gene, etc. The three other tables, ortho, neighbourpairs, and
syntenic blocks, contain the results of detection of orthologs
and of pairs of adjacent orthologs, respectively. These

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/237

three tables were populated after applying the computations described below and in the Results.
Querying SynteBase to identify pairs of adjacent orthologs
Once we have determined the set of orthologs for each
pair of genomes, we tried to identify how many belong to
pairs of adjacent orthologs (Table 5, step 3a). To do that
we filled out the ortho table and we applied the following
SQL query based on a join operation of the ortho table
with itself, selecting all rows where the orthologs of genes
that are adjacent in genome 1 are on the same DNA strand
and adjacent in genome 2:

is well approximated

by the sampling law of T* i.e. {T*(b), b = 1 ... 300}.
To perform the test, we computed 300 bootstrap replicates of T* and calculated the empirical 95% quantile
q0.95. H0 is rejected if T is greater than the quantile of T* at
95%, i.e. if T > q0.95. The test was applied to each intergenomic comparison.

AND b1.strand_2 = b2.strand_2;
In a second step, we attempted to extend the detected
neighborhood relationships to larger synteny blocks
(Table 5, step 3b). Blocks of size greater than 2 were
detected by progressive accretion of blocks of size 2 that
share a common pair of orthologs.
Statistical analysis of the PAM distances of syntenic versus
nonsyntenic genes in all genome comparisons
We call X1 the set of PAM distances separating orthologs
located outside synteny blocks and X2 the set of PAM distances separating orthologs belonging to synteny blocks.

FL wrote the different programs necessary to collect and
analyze data. The three authors participated in the design
of the different experimental approaches, the conception
of the different tools, and the data analysis. The three
authors wrote together this manuscript.

The hypothesis H0:E(X1) = E(X2) was tested against the
hypothesis H1 : E(X1) > E(X2). Since we observed that the
distribution of the PAM distances found in all intergenomic comparisons does not fit a Gaussian distribution,
we preferred using a more robust bootstrap t-test [62]
instead of a classical Student's t-test with n1+n2-2 freedom
