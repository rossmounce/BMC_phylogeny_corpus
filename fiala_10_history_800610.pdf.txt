History of myxozoan character evolution on the
basis of rDNA and EF-2 data
Ivan Fiala1,2*, Pavla Bartošová1,2

Abstract
Background: Phylogenetic relationships among myxosporeans based on ribosomal DNA data disagree with
traditional taxonomic classification: a number of myxosporeans with very similar spore morphology are assigned to
the same genera even though they are phylogenetically distantly related. The credibility of rDNA as a suitable
marker for Myxozoa is uncertain and needs to be proved. Furthermore, we need to know the history of myxospore
evolution to understand the great diversity of modern species.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis of elongation factor 2 supports the ribosomal DNA-based reconstruction of
myxozoan evolution. We propose that SSU rDNA is a reliable marker for inferring myxozoan relationships, even
though SSU rDNA analysis markedly disagrees with the current taxonomy. The analyses of character evolution of
15 morphological and 5 bionomical characters show the evolution of individual characters and uncover the main
evolutionary changes in the myxosporean spore morphology and bionomy. Most bionomical and several
morphological characters were found to be congruent with the phylogeny. The summary of character analyses
leads to the simulation of myxozoan ancestral morphotypes and their evolution to the current species. As such,
the ancestor of all myxozoans appears to have infected the renal tubules of freshwater fish, was sphaerosporid in
shape, and had a spore with polar capsules that discharged slightly sideways. After the separation of Malacosporea,
the spore of the common myxosporean ancestor then changed to the typical sphaerosporid morphotype. This
species inhabited the marine environment as a parasite of the gall bladder of marine fish and ultimately separated
into the three main myxosporean lineages evident today. Two of these lineages re-entered the freshwater
environment, one as a myxosporean with Chloromyxum and another with a primitive sphaerosporid morphotype.
The common ancestor of all marine myxosporeans had a ceratomyxid shape of spore.
Conclusions: We support rDNA based myxozoan phylogeny by the analysis of a protein coding gene and
demonstrate the reliability of rDNA as a marker explaining myxozoan relationships. Our tracing the history of
myxozoan character evolution discloses ancestral morphotypes and shows their development over the course of
evolution. We point out several myxozoan characters that are to a certain extent congruent with the phylogeny
and determined that the discrepancy between phylogeny and current taxonomy based on spore morphology is
due to an extreme myxospore plasticity occurring during myxozoan evolution.

Background
Myxozoans are microscopic metazoan parasites with
extremely reduced body size and structure. Vegetative
stages form spores in both hosts (invertebrates and vertebrates) in their life cycle. The only exceptions are
malacosporeans in the genus Buddenbrockia, which live
in bryozoans and have macroscopic worm-like stages in
their life cycles [1]. Myxozoans were thought to be

protists for more than one hundred years until the 1990
s due to the simplicity of their microscopic spores.
Phylogenetic analysis of the first myxozoan SSU rDNA
[2] then confirmed the marginalized suppositions that
Myxozoa are multicellular organisms [3,4] and placed
Myxozoans within the Metazoa. However, the phylogenetic position of the Myxozoa within the Metazoa was
uncertain due to the weakness of SSU rDNA data
[2,5-7]. More recent phylogenetic analysis based on the
sequences of numerous protein-coding genes of the

malacosporean, B. plumatellae [8], has suggested
Cnidaria as the most closely related taxon to Myxozoa.
The phylogenetic analyses of an increasing number of
myxosporean SSU rDNA sequences raised doubt about
the taxonomic scheme of Myxosporea [9-11]. Great
discrepancies were found between the phylogenetic relationships of myxosporeans inferred from the SSU rDNA
and spore-based myxosporean taxonomy. A number of
myxosporean species with very different types of myxospores (hence belonging to different genera) are grouped
together by the phylogenetic analysis. For example,
many traditional genera, such as Henneguya, Sphaerospora, Myxidium, Zschokkella or Chloromyxum, are polyphyletic. Such incongruence between taxonomy and
SSU rDNA phylogeny raises questions about the reliability of the SSU rDNA as an appropriate phylogenetic
marker for Myxosporea.
Generally, phylogenetic relationships based solely on a
single gene reflect the phylogeny of that particular gene
and may not correspond to the true species phylogeny.
Moreover, single-gene analyses do not provide sufficient
resolution for some nodes or sometimes give conflicting
results. This is often ascribed to the limited number of
nucleotides that can be aligned or to differing rates of
sequence evolution leading to long-branch attraction
[12,13]. Therefore, the congruent results of phylogenetic
analyses based on two or more molecular markers can
provide a more solid ground for better taxonomic classification. Partial sequences of the large subunit ribosomal
RNA (LSU rDNA) gene have served as a second molecular marker and confirmed the SSU rDNA-based relationships of the Multivalvulida [14]. Both of these genes
provided similar tree topology and were also congruent
with another molecular marker (HSP-70) used at the
intraspecific level in the phylogeographical study of
Kudoa thyrsites [15]. The recent work of Bartošová et al.
[16] confirmed the similar evolution of SSU and LSU

rDNA genes for myxosporeans in general. The rDNA
phylogenetic analyses of primary sequences were also
confirmed by the analysis of variable parts of the secondary structure of SSU rDNA [17]. In the present
study, we analyze elongation factor 2 (EF2) as the first
protein-coding marker and we compare the obtained
phylogeny to that of rDNA.
Evolution of myxozoan morphological characters
became a big puzzle after the analyses of molecular data
revealed the discrepancy between morphology and
phylogeny. The myxospore is practically the only life
cycle stage that provides a sufficient number of characters suitable for taxonomy and cladistics. Knowledge of
the evolutionary history of myxospore characters is
therefore important for taxonomic revisions necessary to
correct myxozoan taxonomy. We constructed a matrix
of morphological and bionomical characters of selected
myxozoans whose rDNA sequences were available for
phylogenetic analyses. Then, we mapped these characters on the SSU rDNA-based tree to trace the ancestral
character features to study the evolution of myxozoan
morphotypes as sets of particular character features.

Results and Discussion
Multigene phylogenetic analyses

Phylogenetic analysis of the EF2 amino acid sequence
data of twelve myxosporeans (GenBank Acc. Nos.
HM037908 - HM037919) was congruent with the
rDNA-based phylogeny (Figure 1). Four of five nodes
(ML, MP) with high bootstrap support in a concatenated SSU+LSU analysis were present in the EF2 tree.
Surprisingly, the only exception was the non-sister
relationship of two Kudoa spp. These species were also
paraphyletic in additional phylogenetic analyses of
nucleotide EF2 data (both with all nucleotides and
excluding the third position) as well as in the analysis
based on EF2 codons (additional file 1). The twelve

Figure 2 Summary of tree nodal supports resulted from different analyses of various datasets. Nodes A - J are specified in the Figure 1.
ML = maximum likelihood; MP = maximum parsimony; BI = Bayesian inference. EF2aa = EF2 amino acid sequence data; EF2codon = EF2
sequence data analysed as codons; EF2nt-3 = EF2 nucleotide data with exclusion of the third site; EF2nt = EF2 nucleotide data. Dashes indicate
missing nodes in the resulted tree.

myxosporeans studied represent three significant phylogenetic groups as defined by Fiala [11] in the SSU
rDNA-based study. All of these groups were clear in our
EF2 analysis. Moreover, the position of Chloromyxum
leydigi as an independent lineage was the same. Nodes
with moderate or insignificant support resulting from
concatenated rDNAs analysis were frequently missing in
the EF2 analyses and the sub-tree topologies were different (Figure 2). These sub-tree topologies were different
when either single SSU or LSU rDNA analyses were
compared to their concatenated analysis (additional file
2). These differences apply mainly for nodes in the marine clade, which includes five species representing four
subgroups with unresolved relationships in broad rDNA
based analysis [16]. Reasons for this incongruence may
be related to the lack of informative characters that
would allow resolution of particular species relationships. Concatenated analysis of all three genes (additional file 3) did not improve the nodal supports and
tree resolution (Figure 2).
Congruence of rDNA and protein-coding gene analysis support the relevance of SSU rDNA as a marker for
inferring myxosporean phylogeny. We can be confident
that the polyphyletic and paraphyletic relationships
revealed by SSU rDNA correspond to the correct
species evolution. This supports the presumption that
an evolutionary origin of many morphologically similar
myxospore types is the result of convergent appearance
of successful spore design in myxosporean evolution as
pointed out for sphaerosporids by Holzer et al. [10].

Tracing of history of myxozoan character evolution

Tracing the history of character evolution can help
uncover the morphology of the ancestral myxozoan species. There are no data (and very likely there will never
be) about myxozoans from the fossil record. The only
possible way we can identify ancestral species is by
simulating their evolution via sophisticated computer
programs. We chose the Mesquite program, which is
able to calculate the ancestral state of a given character
by the chosen method similarly as e.g. for annelid character evolution [18]. This simulation allowed us to conceive what the ancestor of all myxozoans probably was
and to find out the morphological characters of ancestors of the main clades. While the weakness of the analysis may be in the selection of available species, the
general scheme of deep ancestral evolution would nevertheless not be affected.
We mapped 15 morphological and 5 bionomical characters on the SSU rDNA tree, which was constructed to
cover all known phylogenetic groups of myxosporeans.
The matrix includes also five unnamed, formally not
characterized species, since they represent significant
morphotypes and phylogenetically important taxa for
the clades in which these species cluster. The summary
of all characters, features, and taxa used in this analysis
is shown in Figure 3. We inferred a character history for
each character using likelihood ancestral state reconstruction methods to understand the process of individual character change as well as the change of the spore
as a complex of characters. Figure 4 summarizes the

evolutionary history of myxospore morphology and the
presumed switches among bionomical characters based
upon this analysis. Cladograms in additional file 4 illustrate the particular character histories for all determined
characters.
Number of valves

The ancestor of all myxozoans had two spore valves.
The analysis showed that the change to the two-valve
character state evolved only once in an ancestor in one
of the marine lineages. The number of valves is the
main taxonomic characteristic on which the separation
of the class Myxosporea into the orders Bivalvulida
Shulman, 1959 and Multivalvulida Shulman, 1959 is
based. Evolution of this character makes Bivalvulida a
paraphyletic group and renders the basic taxonomic
division of Myxosporea erroneous.

feature, distinguishing Henneguya from Myxobolus spp.,
do not share a common ancestor. Our analysis includes
only several Myxobolus and Henneguya sequences,
which does not reflect the true multiple origin of caudal
appendages and the polyphyletic pattern of Henneguya
spp. as described elsewhere [9,11]. Spore filaments are
less frequent features that independently appeared only
in the two terminal taxa under study. Spore bulges
evolved in the ancestor of basal freshwater sphaerosporids and independently in Bipteria formosa, Parvicapsula
minibicornis and Sphaerospora molnari.
Shape of suture line

A curved sutural line is a typical homoplastic character
found several times on terminal nodes of certain Myxidium, Zschokkella, Parvicapsula, Enteromyxum and
Sinuolinea spp.

Shape of spore

Number of polar capsules

Myxosporeans have a variable spore shape that is difficult to delimitate into a few defined categories. We
divided myxospores into eight basic three-dimensional
categories for the purpose of our analysis (See legend in
additional file 4b). The common myxozoan ancestor had
a spherical spore. The myxospore changed its shape by
the enlargement of its width to a crescent or bananalike shape after the switch to parasitizing marine fish.
Descendants of this marine ancestor then diversified
into several different spore shapes, which is in contrast
to the rather uniform spore shape in ancestors of the
main groups of the freshwater lineage.

The ancestral state for the number of polar capsules
(PCs) is two. After the split of Myxozoa into the two
major freshwater and marine clades, the ancestor of the
lineage with mostly freshwater species probably multiplied its PCs to four. A four-PC spore was then reduced
twice to the two-PC spore within the evolution of this
lineage. The four-PC spore then appeared independently
again in the terminal nodes represented by Chloromyxum legeri and C. schurovi. Multiplication of PCs in
the multivalvulids (Kudoa spp. and Unicapsula sp.)
evolved along with an increase in number of spore
valves. The two-PC character of spore changed twice to
a spore with only one PC in myxozoan evolution: 1)
from the ancestor having two PCs at opposite ends (in
the marine lineage) and evolving to Auerbachia and
Coccomyxa spp.; and 2) from the ancestor having its
PCs at the anterior end (in the freshwater lineage) and
evolving to Thelohanellus spp.

Ratio of dimensions of spore width to thickness

This character is derived from the shape of the spore and
uses only three features to characterize spore dimensions.
Such a simple definition of spore shape facilitated the tracing of the evolution of spore shape and showed that the
ratio of spore dimensions is a useful character shared in
many phylogenetic groups. The analysis suggested that
the ancient ancestors had spores thicker or of the same
thickness as the width. Spores wider than thick appeared
more recently in the myxosporean evolution.
Surface ridges and striations

The analysis showed that the primitive feature of this
character is a smooth shell valve. Surface ridges then
evolved in an ancestor of the freshwater lineage after
the separation of myxosporeans into marine and freshwater lineages. Surface ridges are absent in all marine
species except for several marine species clustering out
of the marine clade, e.g. Myxidium coryphaenoideum,
Sphaeromyxa zaharoni and Chloromyxum leydigi. This
supports the position of Sphaeromyxa, a typical marine
genus with a history of parasitism in the freshwater
fishes, inside the freshwater lineage.
Projections of the spore

A typical example of spore projections are the caudal
appendages on Henneguya spores. Species with this

Orientation of polar capsules to a plane of the suture

The ancestor of all myxozoans had the PCs arranged in
the plane perpendicular to the suture line. The ancestor
of species of the freshwater lineage changed the position
of the PCs and the primitive state reappeared independently several times in Sphaerospora spp., Hoferellus gilsoni and Myxobilatus gasterostei. The opposite situation
can be seen in the marine clade: ancestors of several
clades possessed primitive characters and the PC
arrangement to a plane of the suture evolved in the
recent ancestors of current species.
Location of polar capsules and sporoplasm

The primitive state is the position with PCs together at
the anterior part of the spore with a posterior sporoplasm. PCs moved to the opposite end of the spore
quite recently in evolution. This character evolved independently several times and it is common for species of
four distinct phylogenetic groups including species of
genera e.g. Myxidium, Zschokkella and Enteromyxum.

Fiala and Bartošová BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:228
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/228

Shape of polar capsules

The ancestor of all myxozoans had spherical or subspherical shape of PCs. Pyriform PCs evolved in the
ancestors of the freshwater branch. Further, pyriform
PCs appeared independently several times within the
marine lineage.
Position of tips of polar capsules

The evolution of this character is linked to the arrangement of PCs within a spore. Divergent PCs evolved in
parallel with the evolution of PCs in opposite positions
and the history of their evolution is similar. One of few
exceptions of this “co-evolution” is Tetracapsuloides
bryosalmonae possessing divergent PCs arranged
together in its fish malacospore.
Character of polar filament

The feature of having flattened polar filaments evolved
only once and it is unique to species of the genus
Sphaeromyxa.
Number of sporoplasms

The ancestral state is a single sporoplasm. A spore with
two sporoplasms appeared in the common ancestor of
basal sphaerosporids and multivalvulids and in several
current Sphaerospora spp.
Mucous envelope and membranaceous veil

Most of myxozoans do not possess any of these spore
characters. The presence of a mucous envelope or membranaceous veil appeared independently only a few times
in terminal nodes and has no common evolutionary
history.
Vegetative stages

The common ancestors of all myxozoans and the ancestor of species clustering in the marine lineage had small
mono- or disporic plasmodia. Polysporic plasmodia
probably evolved for the first time in the ancestors of
the freshwater lineage and then twice independently in
the marine lineage, whereas the reverse reduction of
large plasmodia to the smaller ones occurred probably
many times.
Site of infection

We analysed the site of infection as a two-state character defined as coelozoic and histozoic. It seems that
there were only two main splits from coelozoic to histozoic site preference in the evolution of Myxozoa leading
to: 1) Myxobolus/Henneguya species and 2) to the group
containing multivalvulids and enteromyxids (including
Ceratomyxa shasta in some analyses).
Site specificity

This multi-state character extends the previous one by
more specific definition of the site of infection. The analysis of a particular site of infection suggested that the
first myxozoans inhabited the excretory system. Later
myxozoans then infected the gall bladder. The ancestors
of several groups moved back from the gall bladder to
the excretory system, intestine, or the muscles. Only the

Page 7 of 13

histozoic Myxobolus and Henneguya spp. show great
variability in the site of infection. Many other phylogenetic groups include species with identical site
specificities.
Host

The typical intermediate host of myxozoans is a fish. It
is very likely that the ancestors of the main myxosporean groups infected the fish whereas several switches to
other vertebrate taxa occurred later.
Host environment

The first myxozoan ancestor was a freshwater species
and then myxozoans expanded to the marine environment. Thus, the ancestor of all Myxosporea was a marine species. Freshwater as the host environment
occurred three times independently: by the ancestor of
species of the freshwater lineage, by the ancestor of the
freshwater basal sphaerosporid, and by Ceratomyxa
shasta. Some freshwater species then re-entered the
marine environment afterward. A typical returnee was
the ancestor of species of the genus Sphaeromyxa, a
diversified group of marine myxosporeans.
Tracing the evolution of particular characters facilitated the reconstruction of the evolution of the myxospores’ morphology and bionomical characters (Figure 4).
Based on our analyses, the ancestor of all myxozoans
had a spore with two valves, was spherical in shape, had
a width that was equal to its thickness, had no surface
ridges and no projections, and had a straight suture line.
Further, the spore had two subspherical and convergent
PCs set in the plane perpendicular to the suture, with
the PCs arranged at its anterior end. There was one posterior sporoplasm, a tubular polar filament, and no
mucous envelope or membranaceous veil. The plasmodia were small and mono- or disporic, the site of infection was coelozoic, and it was a parasite of the excretory
system of freshwater fishes. Furthermore, our analyses
suggested some common trends in the myxosporean
character evolution e.g.: i) myxosporeans with four PCs
and two shell valves evolved only in the freshwater
clade; ii) myxosporeans with four or more shell valves
evolved only once in the marine clade; iii) myxosporeans
with surface ridges or striations and caudal appendages
evolved only in the freshwater clade; and iv) myxosporeans with PCs placed on opposite sides of the spindle or
ellipsoid shaped spore evolved several times in both
marine and freshwater clades. We found only one clear
morphological synapomorphic character following the
phylogenetic relationships of myxozoans. Although such
incongruence between phylogeny and taxonomy is
extreme among eukaryotes, a similar situation was documented in the Microsporidia [19]. Species of this fungal
group reduced their body form to the plasmodial and
spore stages similarly to the myxozoans. Further, and
also similar to what occurs with the Myxozoa, the

Fiala and Bartošová BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:228
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/228

Microsporidian taxonomy based on the morphology of
the spore is not congruent with the phylogeny of the
group. The sole synapomorphic character is the polar
filament. Its arrangement and flattened shape is unique
for Sphaeromyxa spp. and it is one of the most important characters for the definition of the genus Sphaeromyxa. The other 19 characters that we traced were
homoplastic. Nevertheless, bionomical characters (site of
infection, site specificity, and host environment) correlate highly with the phylogeny. Although the myxospore’s morphology generally does not correlate with the
phylogeny, several morphological characters were found
to correspond partially to the phylogeny. These myxospores characters are: the number of valves, the position
of PCs relative to the sutural plane and the sporoplasm,
the ratio of spore width to thickness, and the presence
or absence of surface ridges. This is illustrated by the
frequent presence of clusters of species with the same
character features in the phylogenetic trees (additional
file 4). Connection of these characters could be utilised
in future taxonomic changes (taxon demises or the
establishment of new genera or higher taxonomic levels)
together with the combination of bionomical characters.
The main phylogenetic segregation according to the
myxozoans hosts’ habitat (freshwater and marine) were
firstly documented by Kent et al. [20] and this trend is,
in general, still valid with some exceptions. Our analyses
also supported the site of infection and site specificity as
unique characters that follow the phylogenetic pattern of
many myxozoan species as published elsewhere
[21,10,22,11]. However, there are some exceptions to this
trend (e.g., Sinuolinea phylopteryxa, Myxidium hardella
or Sphaerospora sp. EE2004). These latter parasites of
renal tubules cluster among the gall bladder infecting
species. Nevertheless, site specificity is still a common
feature for many closely related species. Tracing the history of evolution of this character enables the assignment
of the gall bladder site as a feature that evolved early in
evolution. This feature persists among descendants and
occurs among many current species. This means that all
gall bladder infecting species with known SSU rDNA
have ancestors with gall bladder site specificity except for
the deepest ancestor of all myxozoans, which infected the
excretory system. Furthermore, all species with different
site specificity than the gall bladder evolved from ancestors infecting the gall bladder. This corresponds to Shulman’s assumption [23] that the first myxosporean species
was coelozoic and infected the gall bladder.
Spore projections or surface ridges can be considered
as typical examples of homoplastic characters. They very
likely have identical biological function and resulted from
the convergent evolution in myxosporean species. Ridges
probably help spores to float in freshwater, an assumption that is supported by the absence of such features in

Page 8 of 13

species from the marine environment, whose water has a
higher density. The exception is the marine species
Chloromyxum leydigi, which has a close phylogenetic
relationship to the freshwater lineage. Surprisingly, no
ridges appeared on the typical freshwater species-rich
genus Myxobolus. However, floating in this case is probably facilitated by the development of caudal appendages.
This character evolved independently many times during
the diversification of numerous Myxobolus spp. and gave
rise to the current Henneguya spp. Caudal appendages
similar to those found in Henneguya spp. are also present
in species of the genera Unicauda, Dicauda, Hennegoides, Tetrauronema, and Laterocaudata. Although the
SSU rDNA sequences of these species are not available in
GenBank, they would probably cluster within the Myxobolus clade and would be expected to have a similar evolutionary history as that of Henneguya spp.
Based upon our analysis caudal appendages should be
considered as species characteristics but not generic
characters. Suppression of the genus Henneguya can be
expected as well as suppression of the genera Hennegoides, Tetrauronema, Laterocaudata, Dicauda and Unicauda after molecular data is obtained. Some taxonomic
revisions, resulting from phylogenetic analyses, have
been already carried out. Whipps et al. demised the
genera Pentacapsula, Hexacapsula, and Septemcapsula
and assigned their species to the genus Kudoa [14].
Further, Zschokkella mugilis was transferred to the
genus Ellipsomyxa [24]. A radical taxonomic revision
was also recently made by Gunter and Adlard, who
demised the genus Leptotheca and transferred its species
to the genera Ceratomyxa and Sphaerospora [25].
Evolution of myxozoan morphotypes

Our analysis has shown that the myxozoan common
ancestor was a species with a spore morphology similar
to that of current species of the genus Sphaerospora
infecting the renal tubules of freshwater fishes. This
supports the hypothesis of Jirků et al. that current myxozoans are derived from the Sphaerospora-type myxospore [26]. We confirmed that a group of basal
sphaerosporids possesses features ancestral to present
species. On the other hand, some Sphaerospora spp.
with known SSU rDNA sequences branched at several
distinct positions in the tree, which could be explained
by a certain plasticity in the change of myxospores’
shape that would best fit environmental factors. This
supports the idea that the sphaerosporid morphotype
might be a very successful spore design favoured by
convergent evolution [10].
Based on our results, we propose several major trends in
the evolution of myxospore morphotypes (Figure 4). The
morphotype means a set of spore morphological characters typical for group of myxosporeans assigned to the

Fiala and Bartošová BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:228
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/228

same myxosporean genus (e.g. Myxidium or Myxobolus
morphotype). According to Lom and Dyková there are
about 60 described genera of Myxosporea [27], which ergo
represent the same number of current spore morphotypes.
A hypothetical ancestor of all species in the marine clade
evolved from the ancestral sphaerosporid morphotype by
an extension of the spore thickness, giving rise to the ceratomyxid morphotype. This morphotype is retained
through the present as a group of species belonging to the
genus Ceratomyxa. Intestinal Ceratomyxa shasta may
have evolved either from a gall bladder infecting ancestral
ceratomyxid (regardless of its uncertain phylogenetic position as a separate lineage in the marine clade [11]) or as a
basal ceratomyxid [25]. We suggest a different hypothesis,
that C. shasta shared a common ancestor with both enteromyxids and multivalvulids. After the switch from parasitism in the gall bladder to a site location in the intestine, C.
shasta then separated from the enteromyxid and multivalvulid ancestor (dashed line in Figure 4). This possibility is
the most parsimonious solution, with only one switch to
different site of infection. This theory is also supported by
our ML analysis (Figure 5). However, the analysis includes
the limited number of Ceratomyxa sequences. The sphaerosporid morphotype very likely occurred by the ancestor
of Parvicapsula spp. infecting the excretory system. Spores
of Parvicapsula spp. are very similar to those of Sphaerospora spp. and basically represent a further step in the evolution of the sphaerosporid type of spore. The kudoid
morphotype probably evolved by a duplication or multiplication of an ancestral extinct morphotype with an enteromyxid spore shape but with PCs close together. The PCs
then independently moved to the opposite ends of the
spore along with an extension of spore width several times
in myxosporean evolution. This evolution gave rise to the
species classified to the genera Myxidium, Zschokkella,
Ellipsomyxa, Sphaeromyxa and Enteromyxum. Intestinal
Enteromyxum spp. very likely did not evolved from the
Myxidium or Zschokkella morphotype. Despite some similarities in the spore structure with Myxidium morphotype,
Enteromyxum spp. probably evolved from the gall bladder
infecting ceratomyxid ancestor. The morphotype with four
polar capsules and two shell valves similar to that of existing Chloromyxum spp. probably evolved early after the
separation of the marine lineage from the rest of the myxosporeans, including the freshwater lineage and marine
Chloromyxum leydigi. We can hypothesize that the Chloromyxum morphotype was derived from an ancestral
sphaerosporid by the duplication of polar capsules. Later
in the evolution, myxospores then lost these additional
two polar capsules, creating the predominant Myxobolus,
Zschokkella and Myxidium morphotypes of the freshwater
clade. Sphaeromyxa species had evolved by a change in
the character of polar filament from the Myxidium ancestor, which then moved back to the marine environment.

Page 9 of 13

Members of the most species-rich myxozoan genus, Myxobolus, probably evolved from the coelozoic ancestor
infecting renal tubules. Myxobolus spp. invaded numerous
host tissues and then segregated to numerous species during evolution. The origin of caudal appendages present on
the Myxobolus morphotype led to the evolution of species
classified in the genus Henneguya. Thelohanellus spp.
evolved from the Myxobolus morphotype by the loss of
one of its PCs. The same event probably occurred in both
Auerbachia and Coccomyxa spp., which arose from the
Myxidium morphotype in the marine clade. The origin of
Myxobilatus and Hoferellus morphotypes with PCs placed
perpendicular to the suture plane is another proof that the
polar capsules freely change their position relative to the
suture plane during evolution. This is typical for the origin
of Sphaerospora species, which evolved convergently several times in the marine or freshwater clade. Gadimyxa
spp. also differ from their parvicapsulid ancestor in the
arrangement of PCs to a plane of the suture.
Character evolution and phylogeny

A summary of the spore morphology of selected myxosporeans of all genera of the main myxozoan phylogenetic
groups is presented in the Figure 5. This summary
demonstrates spore variability throughout the myxozoan
phylogenetic tree, as well as the close relationship of species with very different spore structure and, vice versa,
the distant relationships of species with very similar
spore morphology. Figure 5 also gives the proportion of
sequenced species (SSU rDNA) of each genus present in
the particular clade relative to the number of all
sequenced species of each genus and to overall number
of described species of each genus. These numbers illustrate the lack of data in many genera. Ten out of about
one hundred known species of Sphaerospora cluster into
five different positions on the SSU rDNA tree. Holzer et
al. interpreted this phenomenon to be a result of the convergent evolution of the primitive sphaerosporid spore
shape [10]. The phylogenetic position of ninety Sphaerospora spp. is still not known. The extreme polyphyletic
nature of species rich genera, such as Sphaerospora, Myxidium, Zschokkella and Chloromyxum, suggests that the
many myxosporeans that have not yet been sequenced
likely may cluster in any phylogenetic branch of the tree.
Significantly, molecular rDNA data are not able to
resolve several evolutionary important nodes in the myxosporean phylogenetic tree [16]. The relationships of the
main myxosporean phylogenetic groups of the marine
clade, as defined in Fiala [11], are uncertain and depend
on taxa sampling and the analysis performed. Tracing the
evolutionary history of studied characters may enable resolution of some uncertain relationships. It has been proven
that site of infection is a factor connecting many myxosporeans. Both Ceratomyxa shasta and Enteromyxum spp.

have uncertain position in the marine clade with low bootstrap supports [11] and identical sites of infection suggest
their common evolution. The spore morphology of the
hypothetical ancestor of enteromyxids and multivalvulids
is likely very similar to C. shasta. However, this disagrees
with a recent analysis of a large number of Ceratomyxa
spp., wherein C. shasta branches as a basal taxon to all
ceratomyxid species [28]. Nevertheless, Kudoa spp. +
Enteromyxum spp. and C. shasta may constitute one histozoic clade in myxosporean evolution.

Conclusions
In this study we support rDNA based myxozoan phylogeny by sequencing and analyses of the protein coding
gene EF2 and demonstrate the reliability of rDNA as a
marker explaining myxozoan relationships. We propose
the evolution of ancestral myxozoan morphotypes. The
evolutionary history enables us to understand the evolution of modern species and supports some uncertain
topologies resulting from the analyses of SSU rDNA data.
Methods
DNA isolation, PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing

DNA was extracted from fresh myxospores using the
DNeasy™Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. EF2 gene was amplified using
A1 (5’-GGNGCNGGNGARYTNCAYYTNGA-3) and A2
(5’-CCARTGRTCRAANACRCAYTGNGGRAA-3) primer set [29]. PCR was carried out in a 25 μl reaction
volume using 10 pmol of each primer, 250 μM of each
dNTP, and 2.5 μl 10 × PCR Buffer (Top-Bio, Czech
Republic) and 1 unit of Taq-Purple polymerase (Top-Bio,
Czech Republic). The reactions were run on a Tpersonal
cycler (Biometra). Amplification consisted of initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min and 35 cycles of 95°C for 1
min, 48°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1 min, followed by 10
min final extension at 72°C. The PCR products were isolated from the gel and cloned into pCR® 2.1-TOPO vector from the pDrive Cloning vector (Qiagen PCR Cloning
Kit) and transformed into competent E. coli-strain XL-1.
Both strands of clones were sequenced on ABI PRISM
3130xl automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems).
Alignments and phylogenetic analyses

Seven alignments of EF2, SSU and LSU data with twelve
myxosporeans were constructed. The cnidarian Aurelia
sp. was set as outgroup. The alignments consisted of single gene data, concatenated SSU + LSU and concatenated
SSU + LSU + EF2 data. EF2 gene was aligned as nucleotide sequence (EF2nt) as well as amino acid (EF2aa)
sequence data. EF2nt were analysed with all three sites in
codon, with the exclusion of the third site of codon and
as codons. The alignments were aligned using MAFFT
program [30] with E-INS-i method and gap opening

Page 11 of 13

penalty (–op) 5.0 and gap extension penalty (–ep) 0.0.
The alignments were visualised in SEAVIEW v. 3.2 [31].
Maximum parsimony (MP) analyses were performed in
PAUP* 4.0b10 [32] using a starting tree build by heuristic
search with random taxa addition, the ACCTRAN-option
and the TBR swapping algorithm. Ts/Tv ratio of 1:2 was
applied for rDNA data and the gaps were treated as missing data. Clade supports were estimated using 500 bootstrap-replicates with random sequence additions.
Maximum likelihood (ML) analyses of EF2aa and EF2nt
as codon sequence type were performed in GARLI v. 0.96
[33]. Amino acid analysis was done using WAG model
and F3x4 method of codon frequencies was chosen for the
codon based analysis. All the other ML analyses were
made in PAUP* 4.0b10. The best model of evolution was
determined by the likelihood ratio test (LRT) implemented
in the Modeltest 3.06 [34]. SSU, LSU and SSU + LSU analyses were performed under GTR + Γ model. EF2nt analysis was performed under GTR + Γ + I model. Bootstrap
values were calculated by 500 bootstrap re-sampling.
Bayesian inference (BI) trees were constructed using
MrBayes 3.0b4 [35]. Likelihood parameters that were set
for the single gene analyses and for the data partitions
of concatenated analyses correspond to the models used
in ML. The number of Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) generations was set to 1,000,000 with every
100th tree saved (two independent runs of four simultaneous MCMC chains). AWTY system [36] was used to
assess the length of MCMC run and Tracer v. 1.4.1 [37]
was used to ascertain the length of burn-in periods.
Morphological matrix and mapping of morphological
characters

Twenty morphological and bionomical characters were
chosen for the analysis (Figure 3). The analysis includes
(1) number of spore valves, (2) shape of spore, (3) ratio
of dimensions of spore width to the thickness, (4) surface ridges and striations, (5) projections of the spore,
(6) shape of suture line, (7) number of polar capsules,
(8) orientation of polar capsules to a plane of suture, (9)
location of polar capsules and sporoplasm, (10) shape of
polar capsules, (11) position of tips of polar capsules,
(12) character of polar filament, (13) number of sporoplasms, (14) mucous envelope, (15) membranaceous
veil, (16) vegetative stages, (17) site of infection, (18) site
specificity, (19) host, and (20) host environment. The
SSU rDNA-based tree was chosen as the basis for
reconstruction of ancestral states. The tree consists of
73 myxosporean species covering the myxosporean
diversity of known SSU rDNA sequences and malacosporean Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae as the outgroup.
The tree was constructed using ML with GTR + Γ + I
model of evolution in PAUP* based on the alignment
computed by MAFFT with parameters described above.

Tree branches with uncertain phylogenetic relationships unstable positions in the tree as described in Fiala [11] were collapsed in their nodes resulting into polytomy for
more accurate reconstruction of myxozoan phylogenetic
relationships. History of character change was traced using
the program Mesquite 2.5 [38]. Reconstruction of character states at ancestral nodes was done by likelihood
method. We used Markov k-state 1 parameter model with
the single parameter (the rate of change) [39]. Any particular change from one state to another is equally probable
within this model.
