Abstract
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a major swine pathogen causing economic losses
in the swine industry almost worldwide. PRRSV has been divided into 2 genotypes, the European (Type 1) and
North American (Type 2) genotype, respectively and displays a large degree of genetic variability, particularly at the
nonstructural protein (nsp) 2 gene. This is the first study determining genetic variation of the nsp2 of Thai PRRSV
isolates. The results showed that 9 out of 10 Thai PRRSV isolates were nsp2-truncated viruses that might have
evolved from a virus previously introduced in the past, but not from one recently introduced.
Findings
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus
(PRRSV) is a major swine pathogen causing major economic losses in the swine industry worldwide. PRRSV is
an enveloped virus with an ssRNA genome of positive
polarity belonging to the order Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae, genus Arterivirus. PRRSV has been genetically
divided into 2 genotypes, the European (Type 1) and
North American (Type 2) genotype, respectively. Both
genotypes are highly diverse, sharing only approximately
60% nucleotide identity [1,2]. However, genetic variations
within each genotype are also highly observed [3,4]. The
PRRSV genome is approximately 15 kb in length and
comprises 9 open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a,
ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b, ORF3, ORF4, ORF5, ORF6 and
ORF7. ORF1a and ORF1b (~12 kb) encode 12 non-structural proteins (nsp), nsp1 - nsp12, which play major roles
in viral replication [5-7]. The remaining ORFs encode
structural proteins [8,9].
The nsp2-coding region is genetically the most variable area and crucial for viral replication due to its protease activity [10]. For nsp generation, as shown with
the equine arteritis virus (EAV, a prototype virus of the
genus Arterivirus) model, ORF1 is primarily translated
into ORF1a and ORF1b polyprotein, and these 2 proteins are then cleaved into nsp1 - 8 and nsp1 - 12,
respectively [11].

Recently, Type 2 PRRSV with a nucleotide deletion in
the nsp2 coding region has been identified in USA,
China, Japan, Denmark and Vietnam [4,12-15]. Following the outbreaks of swine high fever (SHF) syndrome
in China, many genetic variants of the virus have been
isolated. A novel nucleotide deletion in nsp2 found in
those Chinese isolates was initially linked to the virulence of the virus [14]. The objective of this study was
to investigate the deletion patterns of Type 2 PRRSV
found in Thailand. Nine recent Thai isolates of Type 2
PRRSV (2007-2008), 07NP2, 07NP4, 78/51, 8NP46,
8NP154, 08RB1, 8NP147, 8NP148 and 8NP59 and one
previous Thai isolate (01CS1/2) obtained in 2001 (Table
1) (kindly provided by the Chulalongkorn UniversityVeterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, CU-VDL) were
included in this study. All samples were obtained from
PRRSV-affected farms, located in the central region, an
area of Thailand with a large pig population. According
to the farm history, Type 2 PRRSV infection was endemic and clinically stable in those selected farms. Samples were collected when the appearance of respiratory
symptoms in suckling and/or weaning pigs and reproductive failures were highly increased compared to the
baseline.
In this study, at first, 4 complete nsp2 nucleotide
sequences of Thai PRRSV (07NP2, 07NP4, 08RB1 and
8NP154) from the acute re-emerging PRRSV-affected
farms in central Thailand were characterized by multiple
alignment with Type 2 PRRSV from other countries
reported in GenBank. Based on nsp2 of VR2332, the prototype of Type 2 PRRSV, nucleotide deletion was found

in all of those four Thai-PRRSV nsp2 sequences. Then,
the remaining 6 nsp2 sequences of other Thai PRRSVs
(78/51, 8NP59, 01CS1/2, 8NP46, 8NP147 and 8NP148)
were further genetically characterized in the region covering all the nucleotide deletions found in 07NP2,
07NP4, 08RB1 and 8NP154 (nt 885 - 2,205 or aa 296 735). This specific area also contains most nucleotide
deletion positions previously reported [4,13,15]. Nucleotide deletion was also found in 5 of those 6 partial nsp2
sequences.
Therefore, 9 out of 10 Thai PRRSVs in this study had a
nucleotide deletion in the nsp2-coding region (or at least
in the studied region). The size of the partial fragment
(nt 885 - 2,205) of the nsp2-coding region of all Thai
PRRSVs in this study was shown to be 3 - 384 nt smaller
than the VR2332, except for 8NP147 which was devoid
of either nucleotide deletion or insertion (Table 1).
Based on multiple-alignment analysis of nsp2 nucleotide sequences, the results revealed possible deletion
regions (Figure 1). 01CS1/2 and 8NP148 had a 3 nt
(1 aa) deletion at the nt 1,411 - 1,413 position (aa 471).
07NP2, 07NP4 and 78/51 had a discontinuous 141 nt
(47 aa) deletion, a 114 nt (38 aa) deletion at the nt 982
- 1,095 (aa 328 - 365) position and a 27 nt (9 aa) deletion at the nt 1,396 - 1,422 (aa 466 - 474) position.
8NP154 and 08RB1 had a discontinuous 294 nt (98 aa)
deletion, a 291 nt deletion at the nt 997 - 1,287 (aa 333
- 429) position and a 3 nt (1 aa) deletion at the nt 1,411
- 1,413 (aa 471) position. 8NP46 displayed a deletion
pattern resembling 8NP154 and 08RB1 but it also contained an extra 3 nt (1 aa) deletion at the nt 1,537 1,539 (aa 513) position. 8NP59 had a discontinuous 384
nt (128 aa) deletion, a 381 nt (127 aa) deletion at the nt
907 - 1,287 (aa 303 - 429) position and a 3 nt (1 aa)
deletion at the nt 1,411 - 1,413 (aa 471) position.
Interestingly, based on Figures 1 and 2, Thai Type 2
PRRSVs having similar deletion patterns were also located

in the same cluster. Three groups of viruses were similarly
identified based on both deletion patterns and phylogenetic analysis (a group of 07NP2, 07NP4 and 78/51, a
group of 01CS1/2 and 8NP148, and a group of 8NP154,
08RB1, 8NP46 and 8NP59). It should be noted that
8NP147 was the only virus showing no nucleotide deletion
in this study. In addition, it was located on a separate
branch of the other Thai Type 2 PRRSVs. These results
suggest a different evolutionary history of each PRRSV
group in Thailand.
Among the studied Thai PRRSVs, sequence identities
ranged from 77.0 - 99.7% and 68.1 - 99.5% for nucleotide
and amino acid sequence, respectively. 07NP2 and
07NP4 showed the highest sequence identity (99.5% aa
identity and 99.7% nt identity) since those two viruses
had been isolated from the same farm 3 months apart
showing that PRRSV still persisted and caused problems
on that affected farm. The lowest sequence identity was
found with 8NP147 and 8NP154 (68.1% aa identity and
77.0% nt identity). It should be noted that those isolates
were from the same province.
Genetic comparison of nsp2 between Thai Type 2
PRRSVs and previously reported nsp2-truncated Type 2
PRRSVs was conducted. 8NP59, 08RB1, 8NP154 and
8NP46 displayed deletion patterns resembling other virulent isolates such as MN184A, MN184B (USA) and Jnt1
(Japan). However, sequence identity and phylogenetic studies showed no (or minor) genetic relationship. Identity of
the nsp2 amino acid sequences between the Thai PRRSVs
and the virulent US isolates, MN184A and MN184B
ranged from 60.0 - 65.0%. Similarly, they showed only 64.6
- 68.6% identity when compared with the Japanese isolate,
Jnt1 (Table 1).
Amino acid sequence identity between the Thai
PRRSVs and SY0608 (Chinese SHF-related isolate) was
low, ranging from 69.6 - 75.6% (Table 1). Sequence
alignment (Figure 3) and phylogenetic tree (Figure 2)

also showed no (or minor) genetic relationship among
the viruses. These findings confirmed a total lack of evidence of SHF-like virus in Thailand at least at the time
of sample collection. Only severe respiratory symptoms
with moderate to high mortality after weaning were
observed on these studied farms.

The results suggest that nsp2-truncated viruses found
in this study and other nsp2-truncated viruses from other
countries are unlikely to have derived from a common
origin. It is more likely that the nsp2 deletion of the Thai
PRRSVs has occurred in the course of individual self evolution of the PRRSVs previously circulating in Thailand.

One of the most striking characteristics of PRRSV is
its genetic variation [16-19]. Nsp2 is one of PRRSV
genomic regions with very high genetic variability
[4,13,15,20,21]. Although the deletion in the nsp2-

coding region was not related to the virulence of the
emerging PRRSV in China, it could be used as a genetic
marker of the highly virulent PRRSV found in China
[22]. In 2007, it has been shown that the 30-aa-deletion

Figure 3 Multiple alignment of partial nsp2 amino acid sequences. The amino acid sequence alignment was performed using the nsp2 aa
299 - 587 region of ten Thai NA-PRRSV, SY0608 (Chinese SHF-related isolate) and VR2332. The VR2332 sequence was used as a reference.
Identical amino acids and gapped positions (compared with the reference sequence) are shown as dots and hyphens, respectively.

PRRSV was also identified in Vietnam [12] which could
be the result of horizontal transmission between the 2
countries. Since Thailand is in the same area as Vietnam, we therefore searched for evidence of the atypical
PRRSV found in China from the acute 2007 - 2008 reemerging PRRSV outbreaks in central Thailand. The
data suggested that the atypical PRRSV having emerged
in China in 2006 had not yet been introduced into Thailand, or at least into central Thailand since neither Type
2 PRRSV with the 30-aa-deletion pattern nor nucleotide
sequences related to the Chinese isolates were found in
this study.
At present, only 1 complete genomic sequence of the
Thai Type 2 PRRSV has been reported [23]. Since the first
report of PRRSV isolation in 1996, Thailand has implemented a very rigid policy aimed at imported pigs and
semen having to be PRRSV-free. Thus, introduction of
new exotic PRRSV strains from other countries has been
limited to a minimum. Our data did not support the
hypothesis of the introduction of new PRRSV strains with
the same nsp2 deletion patterns from other countries. The

deletion patterns found in this study could stem from the
evolution of the existing PRRSVs in Thailand.
