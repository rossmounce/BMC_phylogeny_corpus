Abstract

Background

coding RNAs has historically been a relatively serendipitous
affair. Only very recently have there been concerted efforts to
identify such genes systematically, using both experimental
and computational approaches [1].
Our collective ignorance of the totality of non-coding RNA
genes was laid bare by recent work on microRNAs (miRNAs),

Genome Biology 2003, 4:R42

information

Although the analysis of sequenced genomes to date has
focused most heavily on the protein-coding set of genes, all
genomes also contain a constellation of non-coding RNA
genes. With the exception of certain classes of RNAs with
strongly conserved sequences and/or structures, such as
ribosomal and transfer RNAs, identification of most non-

interactions

Conclusions: Our computational strategy succeeded in identifying bona fide miRNA genes and
suggests that miRNAs constitute nearly 1% of predicted protein-coding genes in Drosophila, a
percentage similar to the percentage of miRNAs recently attributed to other metazoan genomes.

refereed research

Results: We developed an informatic procedure called 'miRseeker', which analyzed the completed
euchromatic sequences of Drosophila melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura for conserved sequences
that adopt an extended stem-loop structure and display a pattern of nucleotide divergence
characteristic of known miRNAs. The sensitivity of this computational procedure was
demonstrated by the presence of 75% (18/24) of previously identified Drosophila miRNAs within
the top 124 candidates. In total, we identified 48 novel miRNA candidates that were strongly
conserved in more distant insect, nematode, or vertebrate genomes. We verified expression for a
total of 24 novel miRNA genes, including 20 of 27 candidates conserved in a third species and 4 of
11 high-scoring, Drosophila-specific candidates. Our analyses lead us to estimate that drosophilid
genomes contain around 110 miRNA genes.

deposited research

Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a large family of 21-22 nucleotide non-coding RNAs with
presumed post-transcriptional regulatory activity. Most miRNAs were identified by direct cloning
of small RNAs, an approach that favors detection of abundant miRNAs. Three observations
suggested that miRNA genes might be identified using a computational approach. First, miRNAs
generally derive from precursor transcripts of 70-100 nucleotides with extended stem-loop
structure. Second, miRNAs are usually highly conserved between the genomes of related species.
Third, miRNAs display a characteristic pattern of evolutionary divergence.

an abundant family of 21-22 nucleotide non-coding RNAs
[2,3]. The founding members of this family, lin-4 and let-7,
were identified through forward analysis of extant
Caenorhabditis elegans mutants [4,5]. Both of these RNAs
are post-transcriptional regulators of developmental timing
that function by binding to the 3' untranslated regions (3'
UTRs) of target genes [5-8]. Although they were long
regarded as genetic curiosities possibly specific to nematodes,
let-7 was subsequently found to be broadly conserved across
bilaterian evolution [9] and miRNA genes are now recognized
as a pervasive and widespread feature of animal and plant
genomes [10-16].
In general, it is thought that miRNA biogenesis proceeds via
intermediate precursor transcripts of more than 70 nucleotides that have the capacity to form an extended stem-loop
structure (pre-miRNA), although at least some pre-miRNAs
are further derived from even longer transcripts (primary
miRNA transcripts, or pri-miRNAs). These can exist as long
individual pre-miRNA precursor transcripts, as operon-like
multiple pre-miRNA precursors, or even as part of primary
mRNA transcripts. Processing of pri-miRNA into the premiRNA stem-loop occurs in the nucleus, while subsequent
processing of pre-miRNA into 21-22 mers is a cytoplasmic
event mediated by the RNAse III enzyme Dicer [17-20]; Dicer
is also responsible for cleavage of long perfectly doublestranded RNA into 21-22 nucleotide fragments during RNA
interference (RNAi) [2,21]. These latter molecules, known as
silencing RNA (siRNA), bind to and trigger the degradation of
perfectly homologous mRNA molecules via RISC, a doublestrand RNA-induced silencing complex containing nuclease
activity [22,23].
Although the in vivo function of only a few miRNAs is known
so far, it is believed that the vast majority are likely to participate in post-transcriptional gene regulation of complementary mRNA targets. Interestingly, perfect or near-perfect
target complementarity is associated with mRNA degradation [24-26], similar to the effects of siRNA, whereas imperfect base-pairing is associated with regulation by
translational inhibition [6,27]. Recently, siRNAs with imperfect match to target mRNA were observed to function as
translational inhibitors [28], suggesting that the type of 21-22
nucleotide RNA-mediated regulation may be largely determined by the quality of target complementarity.
The vast majority of the approximately 300 miRNAs currently known were identified through direct cloning of short
RNA molecules. Although this method has been quite successful thus far, its practicality is limited by the necessity for
a considerable amount of RNA as raw material for cloning,
and cloned products are often dominated by a few highly
expressed miRNAs. For example, 41% of miRNAs cloned
from HeLa cells are variants of let-7, 28% of human brain
miRNAs are variants of miR-124, and 45% of miRNAs cloned
from human heart and 32% of those cloned from early

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/7/R42

Drosophila embryos are miR-1 [10,29]. In fact, it has been
opined that few additional mammalian miRNAs will be easily
identified by the direct cloning method [30].
As a complementary approach to miRNA identification, we
developed an informatic strategy ('miRseeker') and applied it
to the completed genomes of Drosophila melanogaster and
D. pseudoobscura, which are some 30 million years diverged.
miRseeker subjects conserved intronic and intergenic
sequences to an RNA folding and evaluation procedure to
identify evolutionarily constrained hairpin structures with
features characteristic of known miRNAs. The specificity of
this computational procedure was shown by the presence of
18 out of 24 reference miRNAs within the top 124 candidates.
We identified a total of 48 novel miRNA candidates whose
existence was strongly supported by conservation in other
insect, nematode or vertebrate genomes. Expression of 24
novel miRNA genes was verified by northern analysis (including 20 out of 27 candidates that were supported by third-species conservation and 4 out of 11 high-scoring predictions
specific to Drosophila), demonstrating that the bioinformatic
screen was successful. As might be expected, the newly verified miRNA genes vary tremendously with respect to abundance and developmental expression profile, suggesting
diverse roles for these genes. Inference of our false-positive
prediction and false-negative verification rates (based on our
ability to identify known miRNAs and detect the expression of
highly conserved, and thus presumed genuine, novel miRNAs) leads us to estimate that drosophilid genomes contain
around 110 miRNA genes, or nearly 1% of the number of predicted protein-coding genes. In combination with other concurrent genomic analyses [31-34], it is likely that most
miRNAs in completed animal genomes have now been identified. Collectively, this sets the stage for both genome-wide
and targeted studies of this functionally elusive family of
regulators.

Results
Evolutionarily conserved characteristics of miRNA
genes
The starting point for our studies was a reference set of 24
Drosophila pre-miRNA sequences (let-7, the 21 originally
identified by Lagos-Quintana and colleagues, mir-125, and a
previously undescribed paralog of mir-2 that we named mir2c [9,10,29]). We analyzed this set to derive rules and determine parameters that specifically describe known miRNA
genes within anonymous genomic sequence.
Examination of the genomic sequence of D. melanogaster
and D. pseudoobscura showed that all 24 members of the reference set are highly conserved along the entirety of the predicted precursor transcripts, which typically range between
70-100 nucleotides. When viewed in VISTA plot alignments
[35], miRNA genes reside in short regions of exceptional conservation, easily seen as local 'peaks' (Figure 1). As is the case

information

We propose then that classes 1-3 represent the normal pattern of evolutionary divergence of miRNAs, and consider

interactions

Mutations do eventually accumulate on the non-miRNAencoding arm, and orthologous pre-miRNAs from more
diverged species will often preserve only the 21-24 nucleotide
mature miRNA itself. However, because of preferential divergence within the loop, orthologous miRNAs from species of
an appropriate evolutionary distance (such as D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura) show an equal or greater
amount of change within the loop than on the non-miRNAencoding arm (Figure 2a, class 3). This is the case despite the
fact that the loop is typically only a third to a quarter the
length of each arm. Of the eleven members of the reference
set that show divergence on both an arm and the loop, seven
show more changes in the loop than on the non-miRNAencoding arm and three have an equal number of changes on
the loop and non-miRNA-encoding arm (Figure 2a, class 3);
only one member of the reference set (miR-2b-1) shows a
greater number of changes on the non-miRNA arm than the
loop (Figure 2a, class 6). Finally, there are no cases where
both arms have diverged (irrespective of loop status), a situation that would imply that the miRNA sequence itself had
diverged (Figure 2a, class 4).

refereed research

We next aligned the 24 pairs of orthologous Drosophila premiRNA sequences and assessed their pattern of nucleotide
divergence. There are only three pairs that have been completely conserved (Figure 2a, class 1), indicating that most
pre-miRNAs have diverged to some extent within Drosophila. Unexpectedly, we detected mild selective pressure on
the precise sequence of the non-miRNA-encoding arm. This
attribute is not self-evident. It might have been the case that
point mutations along an arm would be neutral as long as the
status of base-pairing was maintained; this is possible due to
the acceptability of G-U base-pairing in RNA. Instead, we
observed preferential divergence within the loop sequence.
Ten members of the reference set have diverged exclusively
within their loop sequence (Figure 2a, class 2), whereas there
are no members that have diverged exclusively along an arm
(Figure 2a, class 5). This is well illustrated by the Drosophila
let-7 orthologs, which have accumulated four mismatches

and gaps in the loop sequence but maintain perfectly conserved arms (Figure 2b). Thus, the terminal loop is the most
evolutionary labile portion of pre-miRNA.

deposited research

for many other non-coding RNA genes, their degree of
conservation usually exceeds that of coding regions, due to
their lack of third-position wobble. This suggested that
miRNA genes might be found by folding fixed lengths of conserved sequence to identify ones that display the high degree
of relatively continuous helicity characteristic of known premiRNAs. However, pilot studies identified a very large
number of conserved stem-loops in genomic sequence, suggesting that additional criteria were necessary to make effective miRNA gene predictions.

reports

Figure 1
miRNA genes are isolated, evolutionarily conserved genomic sequences that have the capacity to form extended stem-loop structures as RNA. Shown are
VISTA plots of globally aligned sequence from D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura, in which the degree of conservation is represented by the height of
the peak. This particular region contains a conserved sequence identified in this study that adopts a stem-loop structure characteristic of known miRNAs.
Expression of this sequence was confirmed by northern analysis (Table 2), and it was subsequently determined to be the fly ortholog of mammalian mir184. Most conserved sequences do not have the ability to form extended stem-loops, as evidenced by the fold adopted by the sequence in the neighboring
peak.

Figure 2
Classification of conserved stem-loop sequences. (a) Patterns of Drosophila pre-miRNA nucleotide divergence patterns imply a canonical progression in
miRNA evolution. The Drosophila orthologs of 23/24 previously described miRNAs are either completely conserved (class 1), contain one or more
mismatches or gaps located exclusively in the loop (class 2) or contain an equal or greater number of mutations within the loop compared to the nonmiRNA-encoding arm (class 3). We consider these to represent successive steps in the normal evolution of miRNAs and therefore connect them with
arrows. Members of classes 1-3 are considered as equally good candidates while members of classes 4-6 are poor candidates. As we expect class 3
candidates to eventually evolve into class 6 candidates (broken arrow), these evolutionary considerations are most relevant to species separated by an
evolutionary distance comparable to D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura. (b) Preferential divergence of miRNAs within their loop sequences is illustrated
by let-7. The Drosophila orthologs of let-7 contain three mismatches and one gap within the loop, whereas both arms have been completely conserved.

Drosophila candidates that fall into these classes to represent
'good' miRNA candidates. Conversely, we consider classes 46 to have a low probability of reflecting a genuine miRNA in
Drosophila, regardless of how 'impressive' the helical nature
of the conserved stem-loop is. Indeed, we tested one class 4
and seven class 5 candidates by northern blot and failed to
observe expression for any of them, despite extensive, conserved stem-loop structure (data not shown). We emphasize
that these evolutionary considerations are most relevant to
relatively closely related species: since the loop is much
shorter than the arms, we expect class 3 candidates to eventually evolve into class 6 candidates in species separated by
greater evolutionary distance than the two Drosophila species analyzed in the present study (Figure 2a).

Computational prediction of Drosophila miRNA genes
using miRseeker
Overall, the collected observations indicated that miRNAs are
phylogenetically conserved, extended stem-loop structures
that display a characteristic pattern of nucleotide divergence.
We proceeded to identify such sequences in the completed
drosophilid genomes using the following three-part computational pipeline that we call miRseeker (Figure 3).

sequences
We first subdivided Release 3 of the D. melanogaster genome
[36] into 1,287 contigs of 100,500 nucleotides each, with 500
nucleotides of overlap at either end. These were matched to

Identification of conserved stem-loops and evaluation of their quality

Conserved intergenic or intronic sequences are frequently
longer than 100 nucleotides. We chose to evaluate these as a
series of 'regions' that overlap each other by around 10
nucleotides, and grouped these regions into a single 'super-

We analyzed conserved regions with mfold 3.1, an RNA-folding algorithm [41]. As miRNA genes can be located on either
strand, and the quality of predicted hairpin structures can
vary significantly between the respective strands (depending
on the amount of G-U base-pairing), we folded each region as
both the forward and the reverse complement of the extracted
sequence (436,000 regions × 2 = 872,000 mfolds). Evaluation of candidate structures took into account the length of
the longest helical arm (with a minimum cutoff of 23 basepairs) and the free energy of this isolated arm (with a minimum cutoff of ∆G ≤-23.0 kcal/mol). The physical resemblance to the canonical stem-loop precursor was also assessed

information

Using the reference set, we empirically determined parameters for extracting conserved sequences that could contain
miRNA genes (designated as 'regions'). We found that a 100unit segment of the alignment (where a unit is either a single
paired or gapped nucleotide) containing no more than 13%
gaps or 15% mismatches, was sufficient to identify all known
miRNA genes within their respective genomic neighborhoods, with a minimum of additionally selected sequences.

interactions

region'. The rationale for defining 'regions' and 'superregions' came from our observation that RNA folding algorithms would not necessarily identify characteristic premiRNA structures if they were folded within the context of
longer RNAs, owing to base-pairing with non-miRNA
sequence. Thus, region-folding should offer optimal structures, while tracking of super-regions would ensure that multiple overlapping regions were evaluated as a single candidate
gene. We took care to verify that our windowing parameters
segregated individual miRNAs within known miRNA clusters
(the mir-2, mir-13 and mir-3 → mir-6 clusters [10]) into distinct super-regions. This analysis identified 436,000 conserved regions that originate from 118,000 super-regions.

the approximately 18,000 contigs in the first assembly of the
D. pseudoobscura genome produced by the Human Genome
Sequencing Center at the Baylor College of Medicine [37],
using a dataset provided by the Berkeley Genome Pipeline
[38]. We then aligned the repeat-masked D. melanogaster
sequence to corresponding D. pseudoobscura sequence using
the global alignment tool AVID [35,39]. We subsequently
eliminated from the alignment all sequences associated with
the following Release 3.1 annotations [40]: exons, transposable elements, snRNA, snoRNA, tRNA and rRNA genes. In
total, we were able to align 51.3 out of 90.2 megabases of
intronic and intergenic D. melanogaster sequence by this
procedure.

with metrics that reward continuous helical pairing and
progressively penalize internal loops of increasing size. Since
unpaired nucleotides in known miRNAs have a tendency to
be found in symmetric loops, the presence of asymmetric
loops and bulged nucleotides was further penalized. The size

These sequences were identified as high-scoring candidates through miRseeker analysis of drosophilid genomes (except as noted) and are ordered by
their rank and score. The first part of the table includes members of the reference set, whose rank within the reference set is given in parentheses
after the gene name; thus miR-4 ranked 18th among the reference set and 124th overall. The second part of the table includes miRNAs newly
identified in this study. In general, we defined a candidate miRNA sequence on the basis of the bounds of conserved sequence; this is often longer
than the presumed 21-22 nucleotide mature product. The third part of the table includes unverified gene predictions supported by conservation in
Anopheles and/or Apis. Drosophila-specific predictions without confirming expression data may be viewed on the web [43]. References in the

using the first release of the D. pseudoobscura genome while miR-2b-1 and miR-100 failed the conservation filters. These three received very high
miRseeker scores, however, and they have been placed into the list for the sake of comparison, although they are not ranked. Six additional miRNAs
scored poorly but are genuine. These include two members of the reference set (miR-125 and miR-2c), two that were identified by homology to
miRNAs cloned from other species (miR-87 and miR-263b), and two that were identified as Anopheles-conserved stem-loops located in proximity to
other Drosophila miRNAs whose expression was verified by northern analysis (miR-287 and miR-288). Most miRNAs are located in intragenic
regions, and there is an apparent bias for intronic miRNAs to be located on the transcribed strand.

sequence. The highest-scoring region in each super-region
(which could be located on either strand) was then saved as its
representative, and these were ordered. For the top 25,000 D.
melanogaster super-regions, we repeated this analysis on all
regions in the corresponding D. pseudoobscura superregions. We averaged the scores obtained for each aligned
pair of Dm/Dp regions (termed a region-pair) and selected
the highest-scoring region-pair within each super-region as
its most probable miRNA candidate sequence. We then
searched for homologs of these selected regions in Anopheles
gambiae using WU-BLAST of the Dm sequence [42], extending the returned sequences as necessary on their 5' and 3'
ends to make 100-nucleotide windows equivalent to the
queried sequence. The top three mosquito hits were then
folded and scored as before. However, as a large fraction of
known fly miRNAs lack mosquito counterparts (Table 1), we
decided to rank the candidates solely on their average Dm/Dp
score.
miR-125 and miR-2c received exceptionally low scores in this
analysis, while miR-10 was absent because it was not located
in an alignable contig in the first available assembly of D.
pseudoobscura (although it was identifiable by BLAST
search). The other 21 members of the reference set fell into
the top 600 or so in the initial round of scoring, indicating
that our method of scoring stem-loops effectively identified
genuine miRNAs from among the 118,000 conserved superregions.

Evaluation of the divergence pattern in conserved stem-loops
As discussed earlier, 23/24 members of the Drosophila reference set are described by one of three patterns of divergence
(Figure 2a, classes 1-3). In the final set of tests, we implemented a series of Boolean filters to eliminate high-scoring,
conserved stem-loops whose patterns of nucleotide divergence are incompatible with a high likelihood of representing
genuine miRNAs (Figure 2a, classes 4-6).

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/7/R42

encoding arm compared to within the loop (Figure 2a, class
6), leaving behind class 3 candidates as potential miRNAs. Of
the reference set miRNAs, only mir-2b-1 failed these filters
(as a class 6 miRNA), even though it received the eighth highest score of all super-regions in the entire euchromatic
sequence of the drosophilid genomes.
Only about one-third of the highest-scoring conserved stemloops passed these filters (with an even greater fraction of
lower-scoring candidates failing these filters), leaving behind
around 200 candidates from the initial top 600. Of the
reference set, 18/24 (75%) reside in the first 124 candidates,
demonstrating that the overall procedure robustly selected
for genuine miRNAs (Figure 4, Table 1). A second measure of
the utility of assessing patterns of nucleotide divergence is
their ability to select against self-complementary repeats.
Many high-scoring candidates were previously noticed to be
rich in complementary nucleotide repeats (such as CAG, UUG
and CUG, AUAU, or poly(A)-poly(U) repeats) and were presumed to be poor candidates in spite of occasionally remarkable helical structure: nearly all of them were eliminated by
the step 3 filters. We have generated a web interface where
folded structures and evaluation of the top 208 miRseeker
candidates may be accessed [43].
Candidate mature miRNA sequences were defined by the
bounds of the perfectly conserved sequence. A total of 42
novel candidates in the top 208 miRseeker predictions were
supported by additional evidence of sequence and structural
conservation in a third species (primarily Anopheles and
Apis, with a smaller fraction in nematodes or vertebrates). In
cases where candidate miRNAs were identifiable in noninsect species, a putative 21-24 nucleotide product was usually evident. A predicted miRNA produced from candidates
whose only homologs were found in other insects could usually be inferred to within 5 nucleotides (Table 1).

Experimental verification of novel candidate miRNAs
We began this analysis by trimming the 100-unit region to
exclude sequences at the ends of the windowed sequence that
lie outside of the main helical arm. We then defined a potential miRNA candidate sequence as being a perfectly conserved
block of sequence greater than 22 nucleotides in length
located less than 10 nucleotides from the end of the terminal
loop, and eliminated those candidates that did not contain a
potential miRNA (Figure 2a, class 4). If both arms passed this
test, it was kept as a miRNA candidate regardless of loop status (Figure 2a, classes 1 and 2) as either arm could potentially
contain a miRNA. The remaining candidates contain only a
single conserved candidate miRNA arm. We defined the nonconserved arm as the non-miRNA-encoding arm and eliminated the candidate if it displayed a perfectly conserved loop
(Figure 2a, class 5). The remaining candidates contain divergent positions in both the loop and the non-miRNA-encoding
arm. We eliminated those that contained more than four
additional non-conserved positions in the non-miRNA-

We next sought to validate the predicted miRNAs by northern
blot of total RNA isolated from 0-24 hour embryos, third
instar larvae and early pupae, and adult males. The total
number of genes authenticated by this method is an underestimate, for two main reasons. First, the mature miRNA can be
derived from either arm of a given stem-loop, and many predicted pre-miRNAs fold well on either strand. In some cases
(such as miR-4 and miR-100), the nontranscribed strand
actually adopts a fold with longer continuous helices than
does the transcribed strand. As we tested one or two probes
for each candidate, a false-negative result will have been
obtained if we tested either the incorrect arm or strand of a
putative miRNA. Second, a significant fraction of miRNAs are
likely to be expressed at extremely low levels or in a highly tissue-specific manner, and so may not be amenable to confirmation by these means. With these concerns in mind, we
tested 38 candidate genes from two classes of predicted miRNAs: 27 that were conserved outside of Drosophila (25 of

information

In total, we observed expression for 20 out of 27 (74%) candidate genes that were conserved outside Drosophila and 4 out
of 11 (36%) of high-scoring Drosophila-specific predictions
(Figure 4b). Two of the former class were low-scoring candidates that were nonetheless conserved in Anopheles (miR287 and miR-288), indicating that third-species conservation
is in our hands a very strong indicator of a candidate gene's
validity. Table 1 lists bona fide Drosophila miRNAs that
scored in the top 208, grouped as members of the reference
set followed by newly identified miRNAs that fulfill accepted

The expression profiles of computationally identifed miRNAs
during development were much more heterogenous than
those of the known set of embryonically derived miRNAs [10].
We identified miRNAs whose expression was highly
restricted to individual developmental periods (embryogenesis, larval/pupal development, or adulthood), ones expressed
in two of these developmental windows, and ones expressed
throughout development, either at a relatively uniform level
or in a progressive fashion. Selected hybridizations that illustrate the different temporal and quantitative profiles are
shown in Figure 5 and the collected northern data are summarized in Table 2. We also note that these experimentally
verified miRNAs vary tremendously in abundance, with several being two to three orders of magnitude less abundant
than miRNAs discovered by direct cloning. Other undetected
miRNAs orthologous to ones cloned in other species (that is,

miR-137 and miR-219, Table 1) may be present at even lower
levels. This suggests that their identification by sequencing
miRNA cDNA libraries would have been unlikely.

nucleotide position along the chromosome arm (that is,
2R:4681879). We note that while this work was in preparation, forward genetic analysis of bantam demonstrated that it
encodes a miRNA [44] that was identified as a high-scoring
candidate by miRseeker. In addition, a subset of the newly
identified miRNAs (miR-34, miR-79, miR-87, miR-92a, miR124b, miR-133 and miR-263a) were independently found by
homology search or by informatic means and confirmed by
northern analysis while this work was under review [34,45].
Conservation alone is an insufficient criterion for assessing
the validity of a miRNA [46]. Indeed, one high-scoring candidate (number 78, 2L:13233310 that is strongly conserved in
Anopheles and was identified by miRseeker appears to be an
unannotated U2 snRNA [43]. Nevertheless, our high success
rate (20/27) leads us to believe that failure to observe expression of a high-scoring, third-species-conserved miRseeker
candidate could reflect a false-negative result. As an example,
we show alignments and RNA folds of the four insect
orthologs of 2R:11128979, which all adopt canonical, highscoring stem-loop structures and collectively display patterns
of nucleotide divergence characteristic of genuine miRNAs
(preponderance of divergence within the loop, slightly less
divergence along a nonconserved arm, and perfect conservation of a putative miRNA-encoding arm) (Figure 6). Although
in this case evidence for expression of either strand by northern analysis was not obtained, it was subsequently found to be
orthologous to miR-137, and thus accepted as a genuine
miRNA. We hypothesize that other novel, high-scoring candidates with a similar level of third-species-conservation but
which lack evidence of expression may in fact be genuine,
thus implying up to 7/27 (26%) false-negative rate of northern analysis.
Together, these data allow us to estimate the number of Drosophila miRNA genes. In the first 124 candidates, there are 18
members of the reference set and 25 novel miRNAs that meet
accepted criteria for representing genuine miRNAs. Of the
remaining candidates, around 36% may be genuine, although
this rises to a maximum of approximately 62% if one considers the inferred false-negative rate of northern analysis. Thus,
there may be between 81 × (0.36 to 0.62) = 29 to 50 additional miRNAs in this list of unverified and/or untested

A subset of miRNA genes are known to reside in local
genomic clusters with possible operon-like organization. The
largest cluster of miRNA genes in Drosophila includes six
that were previously identified as the mir-3 → mir-6-3 cluster
[10]. We identified two additional conserved stem-loop structures that flank mir-3 (Figure 7a), one of which (mir-286) was
confirmed by northern blot (Figure 5a). Surprisingly, mir286 is the only member of this seven-miRNA cluster that is
conserved in Anopheles, indicating tremendous flux in the
miRNA content of this region even within the Diptera. We
also observed that miR-286 is related at its 5' end to another
experimentally verified miRNA (miR-279, Figure 5h), suggesting that they may have related functions.

candidates. Therefore, we estimate 72-93 miRNAs (18 reference + 25 novel verified genes + 29-50 additional unverified
candidates) at a cutoff that includes 18/24 (75%) members of
the reference set, allowing us to extrapolate that drosophilid
genomes may contain 96-124, or around 110 miRNA genes.
This suggests that nearly 1% of Drosophila genes are miRNAs, a figure that is in relative accord with the percentage
recently ascribed to vertebrate genomes [31].

deposited research

miR-280

Another notable cluster that includes previously identified
miRNAs is one containing mir-100, let-7 and mir-125 (Figure
7c). miR-125 is an apparent homolog of C. elegans lin-4 [29],
which functions with let-7 to regulate developmental timing
in nematodes. Although complementary sites for both miRNAs are found in the 3' UTRs of several putative nematode
targets, these miRNAs are not physically linked in the C. elegans genome and their mutant phenotypes are principally
due to misregulation of different transcripts [4-6,8]. The
function of these miRNAs has not yet been explicitly
demonstrated in other species, but Drosophila let-7 is regulated at the larval-pupal transition by ecdysone [49], and all
three members of this cluster are present in other insects and
in vertebrates, thus implying broadly conserved functions.
Their existence in a gene cluster in Drosophila and Anopheles
(data not shown) may imply that their functions overlap to a
greater extent in insects than in nematodes. This could
explain why individual let-7 or miR-125 mutants with strong
developmental defects have not yet been identified in Drosophila by genetic means. Our observation that the temporal
expression profile of miR-100 (Figure 5d) is similar to that
described for let-7 and miR-125 (that is, expression is initiated during larval/pupal development and continues through
adulthood [9,29]) is consistent with probable coordinate
expression of all three as a single pri-miRNA transcript, and
may further implicate miR-100 in developmental timing.
While this work was under review, the clustering of miR-100,
let-7 and miR-125 was independently reported; these
researchers also provide evidence for coordinate expression
of these miRNAs as a single pri-miRNA [45,50].

reports

miR-289

The volatility of miRNA genes is further indicated by members of the miR-2/miR-13 K box subfamily [47]. Seven members were previously reported that are scattered in four
genomic locations on three different chromosome arms,
including a cluster of three mir-2 genes on 2L and a cluster of
two mir-13 genes on 3R; we also identified an additional paralog of mir-2 (mir-2c) that is located in the mir-13 cluster.
Unexpectedly, the Anopheles genome contains only four
members of this subfamily, and all are located in a single cluster on 2L (Figure 7b); the same four members were identifiable in the unassembled genomic sequence of Apis [48]. The
simplest scenario is that members of the K box-family have
undergone radical duplication and dispersal about the
genome in Drosophila. This is consistent with the finding that
the remaining members of the K-box family [47], including
mir-11, the three mir-6 paralogs and the K-box-antisense
gene mir-5, are similarly absent from both Anopheles and
Apis. However, one new putative member of the K-box family
(2R:4681879) was identified by miRseeker, and it has been
conserved in all four sequenced insect genomes.

Figure 6
Example of a miRNA with false-negative evidence by northern blot (2R:11128979 = miR-137). In this example, four related sequences from four species of
insects (Dm, D. melanogaster; Dp, D. pseudoobscura; Ag, A. gambiae; Am, A. mellifera) all adopt a phylogenetically conserved stem-loop structure. One arm has
been perfectly preserved among all four species, and we presume that a miRNA is processed from within the conserved sequence (orange). Patterns of
nucleotide divergence characteristic of miRNAs are seen, with more related sequences (Dm/Dp and Ag/Am) showing approximately equal amounts of
divergence within the loop and along one arm, whereas the Dm/Dp vs Ag/Am comparison shows complete divergence within the loop (blue), with slightly
less overall divergence along the putative non-miRNA-encoding arms. We deduce that a mature miRNA may initiate at one of the U residues that are
highlighted by asterisks, as the first residue of the conserved region is found in the loop of the drosophilid hairpins and the second G residue is unfavored
as the 5' residue of a miRNA. Northern analysis was negative using a probe complementary to the conserved region as well as with a probe identical to the
conserved region (in the event that a miRNA is transcribed from the other strand). This sequence was only subsequently discovered to be orthologous to
vertebrate miR-137 (which initiates at the second highlighted U). We consider other unverified predicted genes conserved in other insect species with
similar characteristics to be potential candidates (see also Table 1).

greater helical structure than does its transcribed strand. Second, it is the only confirmed Drosophila miRNA that deviates
from the expected pattern of divergence in two fundamental
ways: it not only contains a mismatch on the arm while maintaining a perfectly conserved loop (and thus failed the conservation filter as a class 5 candidate), but the mismatch actually
resides within the mature miRNA sequence itself. Therefore,
the identification of miR-100 in flies relied upon its conservation in other species.
We identified several additional examples of closely linked
miRNAs that are transcribed from the same strand (Figure

7d). These include clusters containing paralogous miRNA
genes (such as mir-281a and mir-281b) others that contain
unrelated genes (mir-12/mir-283, mir-34/mir-277 and mir275/2L:7418176 clusters), and some that are a mixture of
both (mir-79 cluster). Unexpectedly, we did not find that
clusters of paralogous miRNA genes were more prevalent, as
might have been predicted a priori if gene clusters generally
result from local gene duplications. This is apparently corroborated by the identification of several miRNA clusters whose
processed products derive from opposing arms of their
respective precursors (Figure 7) [10,29]. A second curious
observation is that relatively few Drosophila miRNAs are

Although the first two miRNA genes were identified through

identified by direct cloning of mature 21-22 nucleotide RNAs,
either from size-selected total RNA or from purified miRNP
complexes. The direct cloning method has the distinct
advantages of being expression based and aimed at identifying the processed miRNA that is presumably the active regulatory species. While it is clear that cloning efforts in some

they are physically linked or not. In fact, we identified only
four new examples (miR-281a+b,miR-276a+b, miR-92a+b
and miR-263a+b) to add to the previously described sets of
miR-6 and miR-2/miR-13 genes. This contrasts with observations of miRNAs in vertebrates, where the majority of known
miRNAs are members of paralogous gene sets [31]. The most
extreme examples of this disparity are let-7 and mir-29,
which are present in single copies in Drosophila, but are represented by thirteen and six distinct human homologs,
respectively.

organisms have been far from saturating, work in other
organisms (mammals) suggests that efforts of this sort will
give sharply diminishing returns. In any case, it is likely that
many miRNAs will not be amenable to direct cloning, including those that are present at very low levels (be they poorly
expressed, highly unstable, inefficiently processed, or
expressed by small numbers of cells) or whose expression is
otherwise restricted to times and/or locations for which the
isolation of sufficient amounts of RNA for cloning is impractical.
In theory, a computational approach based on the structural
features of known miRNA genes might permit the unbiased
discovery of the remaining complement of miRNA genes in a
given sequenced genome. However, in one test, around 5% of
randomly selected C. elegans genomic sequences were found
to have the capacity to fold into plausible miRNA precursor
hairpins [11]. This suggests that computational prediction of
miRNAs based on presumed structure alone would have an
unacceptably high false-positive rate. This type of approach
might be strongly aided by comparative genomics, whereby
one confined the analysis to genomic regions subject to both
evolutionary and structural constraint. The proof of principle
behind this dual scheme was demonstrated by the identification of several miRNAs via a structural analysis of genomic
sequence conserved over 50 million years of nematode evolution [12]. Indeed, the great majority of C. elegans miRNAs
identified through the direct cloning approach are conserved
in the genome of C. briggsae, with conservation typically
extending across the length of the predicted miRNA
precursor.
In this study, we describe miRseeker, a computational
approach for the identification of Drosophila miRNA genes
that ranks conserved stem-loop structures and assesses their
pattern of nucleotide divergence. miRseeker successfully
identified nearly all of the known Drosophila miRNA genes,
and a strong majority of novel, high-scoring candidates were
verified by northern analysis. In total, we catalogued 32 newly
verified miRNAs (24 of which were confirmed here by northern blot), bringing the current Drosophila tally to 56. Our
data allows us to estimate the presence of around 110 miRNA
genes in Drosophila. The approach used in this study should
be applicable to the analysis of other sets of sequenced
genomes of related higher eukaryotic model organisms.
While this manuscript was in preparation and in submission,
several other computational predictions of miRNA genes by
similar overall strategies were reported [31-34]. The results of
our studies are most similar to analyses by Bartel and colleagues predicting 200-255 miRNA genes in vertebrates, or
nearly 1% of the predicted genes in humans [31]; this is comparable to our estimate of flies.
A unique aspect of miRseeker amongst the recently described
methodologies is its assessment of the pattern of nucleotide
divergence within miRNA precursors. The existence of this

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/7/R42

pattern, which is reflected by initial divergence within loop
sequence, was unexpected. Two conclusions may be drawn
from this phenomenon. First, the loop appears to be the least
critical feature of a pre-miRNA, an observation supported by
the identification of orthologous insect miRNAs that vary
quite significantly in terms of both loop size and sequence
(data not shown). Second, there appears to be measurable
selective pressure on the sequence of the non-miRNA arm,
above and beyond the necessity to maintain a certain degree
of helical structure that would make it a Dicer substrate. This
is perhaps at odds with the nonspecific activity of Dicer,
which efficiently processes virtually every input dsRNA ever
tested in RNAi assays. It may be the case that specific
sequence requirements become greater when processing
imperfect stem-loops characteristic of pre-miRNA, or alternatively, that the non-miRNA-encoding product may in fact
have some previously unappreciated function. Nonetheless, it
is clear that the selective pressure on the non-miRNA-encoding arm is mild, and that it diverges long before the sequence
of the mature miRNA does.
It is worth noting that the fraction of miRNAs conserved
between mammals and fish, which are around 450 million
years diverged, appears to be significantly higher than the
fraction of miRNAs that are conserved between flies and mosquitoes, which are separated by only 250 million years of evolution (this paper and [31]). This indicates that insect
miRNAs evolve much more rapidly than do vertebrate miRNAs. This is in general agreement with analyses of orthologous protein pairs, which showed that dipteran pairs had a
higher rate of divergence than did fish/human pairs [51].
Since it may be argued that the selective environmental
pressures are more different between these sequenced vertebrates, it may be that the relatively high rate of divergence in
Diptera is a consequence of their shorter generation times.

Of false negatives and false positives
In these heady times of miRNA gene discovery, it is prudent to
exercise caution in designating predicted genes as bona fide, just
because they resemble known miRNA genes [46]. At the same
time, while many thousands of annotated protein-coding genes
are not associated with cDNA clones or other evidence of expression, computational methods of their identification are robust
enough for them to be considered 'real' genes until proven otherwise. It is our hope that refinement of miRNA prediction algorithms may further reduce the false-positive rate and elevate
confidence in their output to a comparable level. Consideration
of nucleotide bias at the 5' end of miRNA (including a propensity
to begin with U) may improve predictions [11], although we
stress that our algorithms were designed to predict pre-miRNA
genes and not mature miRNA sequences themselves. The extent
of the precisely conserved arm (thus including a potential
miRNA) was in most cases longer than the mature product, and
it would have been arbitrary to select a candidate miRNA
sequence just so that it began with a U. Notably, a recent study
suggests that different chemical strategies for capturing miRNA

Perhaps the most outstanding current challenge regarding
miRNAs lies in determining their regulatory targets. It is

Comparative genomic analyses of orthologous drosophilid
genes should aid in this endeavor, as evidenced by the recent
demonstration that several conserved motifs in the 3' UTR of
the pro-apoptotic gene hid are targets of the miRNA bantam
[44]. Statistically significant pairings of conserved and/or
overrepresented 3' UTR motifs can be assessed for complementarity to miRNAs. Comparisons with Anopheles
orthologs may also prove useful in this regard. For example,
as is the case for their drosophilid counterparts, Anopheles
transcripts for two types of Enhancer of split genes (basic
helix-loop-helix repressor and Brd-family) contain Brd, K
and GY box motifs in their 3' UTRs (E.C.L., unpublished
observations). We anticipate that other examples of sequence
motifs that are conserved in orthologs of the three dipterans
and that are strongly complementary to miRNAs will be
prime candidates to test as new examples of miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional gene regulation.

deposited research

Prospects

The 5' ends of a large subset of experimentally derived Drosophila miRNAs were recently observed to be perfectly complementary to Brd boxes, K boxes and GY boxes, a set of 3'
UTR sequence motifs involved in post-transcriptional regulation [47,53-55]. This suggests that, at least in Drosophila, a
subset of relevant miRNA targets might be found by searching for complements to the 5'-most 8-10 nucleotides of miRNAs in 3' UTRs. This procedure certainly produces many
candidate regulatory pairs (I. Holmes and E.C.L., unpublished observations), but so many matches are found that it is
difficult to single out individual cases as being more likely to
be genuine.

reports

Despite these potential sources of error, the robust ability of
miRseeker to identify genuine miRNAs is clearly indicated by
its ability to identify most of the previously known Drosophila
miRNAs as very high-scoring candidates and by our experimental validation of a very large number of newly identified
candidate miRNA genes.

presumed that most of them will form RNA duplexes with
complementary sequences in mRNA, but direct regulatory
relationships are known for only a handful of miRNAs.
Although many miRNAs in plants were found to be nearly or
completely complementary to known or putative target
mRNAs [24,52], the few cases of known or presumed animal
miRNA targets involve imperfect and limited homology.
Indeed, searches for complements to miRNAs in animal
genomes to date have not succeeded in detecting matches
more compelling than those identified in random sequence.
Thus, matching miRNAs to their cognate targets in silico
presents a daunting task.

reviews

Potential false negatives fall into several classes. First, our
search was based on the currently sequenced and alignable
portions of the D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura
genomes. As mentioned earlier, one of the 24 reference
miRNAs (miR-10) did not reside in an aligned region, even
though it was readily identified in available D. pseudoobscura
sequence by BLAST query. Next, as our strategy relies upon
conservation of primary sequence, we will have missed exceptionally divergent miRNAs, including class 6 candidates.
Comparisons with Anopheles demonstrate that dipteran
miRNA genes evolve rapidly and although none of the reference set is absent from D. pseudoobscura, there may be
examples that are specific to individual drosophilid species.
The recent discovery of a large class of tiny non-coding RNA
genes (tncRNAs) that share some features with miRNAs provides a precedent for exceptionally rapidly evolving small
RNA genes; tncRNAs are not even conserved within
Caenorhabditis [33]. We also masked exons from the search,
so we will have excluded any miRNAs that might be processed
from spliced mRNA, including untranslated regions. Finally,
we will have missed those miRNAs that proceed through precursor transcripts of unusual structure. Although most
known pre-miRNAs in Drosophila, Caenorhabditis, mice and
humans form relatively canonical stem-loops of around 70 to
100 nucleotides in length, plant miRNA precursors are often
processed through exceptionally long stem-loops (many 150
nucleotides or longer) [14-16]. miR-125 is a member of the
Drosophila reference set that received a low score by our
informatic procedure, possibly because it may derive from an
unusually long stem-loop (120 nucleotides), only a portion of
which was included in the queried window. In addition, other
plant miRNAs may proceed through precursors of noncanonical structure, such as multiple stem-loops or stem-loops of
poor quality [14]. The existence of these types of pre-miRNAs
in metazoans is unknown at present.

comment

molecules may differentially recover miRNAs according to their
5' ends [33], so reevaluation of miRNA 5' bias may be in order.
Incorporation of promoter evidence in gene models may also
help, given recent speculation that miRNA genes may be transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Our confidence in the high-scoring Drosophila-specific candidates, most of which we did not
test in this study, will also undoubtedly be bolstered by their
conservation in the genomes of additional species of Drosophila.
We eagerly await the initiation of these sequencing projects.

miRseeker computational pipeline
The computational screen for Drosophila miRNAs was executed with a pipeline of custom developed Perl scripts that we
refer to as miRseeker. These integrate sequence inputs from
flat files with parallel computation on a 55-node Beowulf
Linux cluster [57], load results into a specialized MySQL
database and produce web page summaries of miRNA candidates. The scripts are grouped into three general processes as
schematized in Figure 3.

Extraction of conserved Drosophila sequences
Release 3 of the D. melanogaster genome [36] was divided
into 1,287 contigs of 100,500 nucleotides each, with 500
nucleotides of overlap at either end. These contigs were
aligned to the first assembly of the D. pseudoobscura euchromatic sequence [37] by running 1287 parallel AVID jobs on
the Linux cluster. Aligned sequences with the following
Release 3.1 annotations [40] were eliminated: exons, transposable elements, snRNA, snoRNA, tRNA and rRNA genes.
Conserved miRNA candidate regions were extracted from the
aligned nongenic drosophilid sequence as follows. A 100-unit
window (where a unit is either an aligned or a gapped nucleotide) was advanced across the AVID alignment files by single
units. Once a window that satisfied minimal conservation criteria (≤13% gaps and ≤15% mismatches) was identified, the
corresponding Dm and Dp sequences (regions) were stored as
a multiple fasta file. The window was then advanced by 10
units and reassessed. The window continued to advance by 10
units until it no longer satisfied our criteria for conservation,
at which point it was advanced by single units until the next
conserved region was identified. Around 436,000 conserved
regions were identified in this way.
The forward and reverse complement sequences of the
regions were loaded into a MySQL database. If two D. melanogaster regions initiated within less than 13 nucleotides of
each other, they were grouped into a super-region; reiterated
grouping sorted the 436,000 regions into 118,000 distinct
super-regions.

RNA folding and scoring of conserved stem-loops
All Dm regions were folded with mfold 3.1 by submitting parallel batches of 500 mfolds to the cluster nodes and copying
the .det and .out mfold output files to a final storage destination. All mfold outputs were parsed, and information about
the number of structures, number of arms per structure, size
of helices within arms and size and symmetry of the internal
loops within arms was loaded into the MySQL database.
Two parameters for each individual arm in each output structure were evaluated: free energy (∆G kcal/mol) and miRNAlike helicity. Helicity was calculated by awarding +1 for each
paired nucleotide, -1 for each one-nucleotide symmetric loop

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/7/R42

and -2 for each two-nucleotide symmetric loop. A progressively increasing penalty was applied for symmetric loops
greater than three nucleotides as well as for all bulged nucleotides and asymmetrically sized loops, as these are more rarely
observed in genuine miRNAs. An overall score was calculated
as (helical score + (ABS(∆G)/2))/2. For each super-region a
single region that includes the highest scoring arm was
flagged.
All steps outlined above in the sub-section above were
repeated for regions contained within Dp super-regions corresponding to the top 25% Dm super-regions. The average
score of each corresponding Dm and Dp region (termed a
region-pair) was determined, and the highest-scoring regionpair in each super-region was flagged as its best candidate
miRNA.
Representative regions were then rank-ordered by average
Dm/Dp score. The D. melanogaster sequences from the top
20% of Dm/Dp regions were blasted against the Anopheles
genome. The top three Anopheles blast hits were subjected to
the steps outlined in the previous sub-section and the bestscoring structure was determined and linked to rank-ordered
Dm/Dp regions. In most cases, either no Anopheles blast hit
or non-homologous sequence was returned. The blast hit was
determined to be homologous if it folded into a similar structure as the drosophilid sequences and one or both helical
arms were highly conserved; these candidates are flagged
orange on the web output.

Evaluation of the divergence pattern in conserved stem-loops
The alignment of Dm/Dp sequences was processed to distinguish loop regions (colored blue on the web output) and arm
regions (colored red on the web output). Since mfold tends to
insert small helices within terminal loops that falsely reduce
the size of the terminal loop, small terminal loops (3, 4 or 5
nucleotides in length) were extended to seven nucleotides.
Potential miRNA-encoding arms were then identified as perfectly matched blocks of sequence more than 22 nucleotides
long and less than 10 nucleotides from the end of either side
of the terminal loop (colored yellow on the web output). If no
such sequence was found, the region was eliminated. If both
arms contained potential miRNA sequences, the region
passed and it was considered a miRNA candidate (colored
green on the web output). If only one potential miRNAencoding arm was identified, then the other arm was defined
as the non-miRNA-encoding arm. The terminus of the potential miRNA-encoding arm was provisionally defined as the
end of the perfectly conserved sequence, and the nonmiRNA-encoding arm was trimmed to an equal helical
length. The number of mismatched and gapped nucleotides in
the loop region and in the non-miRNA-encoding arm was
evaluated. Candidates with only a single candidate miRNAencoding arm were disqualified if they did not diverge in the
loop or the number of mismatches in the non-miRNA-encoding arm was four or more mismatches greater than the

reviews

For the genome-wide search, several steps of the pipeline that
do not require interaction with the database were run in parallel on the Linux cluster (including AVID alignments, extraction of conserved regions, and mfolds) and represent a
significant amount of computational time. To allow public
access to miRseeker, we developed a scaled-down version of
our computational pipeline [58]. It allows a user to input two
sets of homologous sequences (up to 100 kb) from any two
species along with gene annotation for one of them, and performs all the steps of the miRNA-finding procedure described
above, producing a list of miRNA candidates ordered by
score. A cutoff score that reliably distinguishes genuine miRNAs will differ with sequences from different input genomes.
Our experience with drosophilid genomes suggests that a cutoff of 16.00 produces genuine candidates but also a high fraction of probable false negatives, whereas a cutoff of 17.00
defines candidates of much higher overall quality. We stress
that the conservation consideration described above applies
only to appropriately related species (such as Dm/Dp) and
should not be indiscriminately used to filter miRNA candidates derived from comparative analysis of other species. The
miRseeker public interface currently supports only a single
concurrent user.
