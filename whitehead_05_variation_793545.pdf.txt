Abstract

The regulation of gene expression varies extensively among
tissues, individuals, strains, populations and species [1-6]
and variation in gene expression has a genetic basis [7,8].
Despite such biological variance, differences in gene expression are used to describe cancers [9-12], heart failure [13,14]

and metabolic diseases [15]. It is common for these pathologies to be associated with changes in tissue-specific gene
expression or changes in metabolic gene expression. For
example, many different cancers have unique tissue-specific
patterns of gene expression [16], and thyroid cancers are

interactions

Conclusions: These data indicate that many tissue-specific differences in gene expression are
unique to one population and thus are unlikely to contribute to fundamental differences between
tissue types. We suggest that those subsets of treatment-specific gene expression patterns that are
conserved between taxa are most likely to be functionally related to the physiological state in
question.

refereed research

Results: Half of the genes (48%) were differentially expressed among individuals within a
population-tissue group and 76% were differentially expressed among tissues. Differences among
tissues reflected well established tissue-specific metabolic requirements, suggesting that these
measures of gene expression accurately reflect changes in proteins and their phenotypic effects.
Remarkably, only a small subset (31%) of tissue-specific differences was consistent in all three
populations.

deposited research

Background: Variation in gene expression is extensive among tissues, individuals, strains,
populations and species. The interactions among these sources of variation are relevant for
physiological studies such as disease or toxic stress; for example, it is common for pathologies such
as cancer, heart failure and metabolic disease to be associated with changes in tissue-specific gene
expression or changes in metabolic gene expression. But how conserved these differences are
among outbred individuals and among populations has not been well documented. To address this
we examined the expression of a selected suite of 192 metabolic genes in brain, heart and liver in
three populations of the teleost fish Fundulus heteroclitus using a highly replicated experimental
design.

Although tissue-specific gene expression patterns are often
used as a method to identify functionally relevant genes, how
conserved these differences are among outbred individuals
and among populations has not been well documented. It is
possible that many of these changes represent polymorphism
among individuals or populations and are not specifically
associated with disease. To address this we used a well established system (tissue-specific gene expression) and genes
with well defined function and tissue-specific distributions
(metabolic genes).
Given the high variance in gene expression among individuals
and populations, our goal was to examine the conservation of
tissue-specific gene expression among populations of the
same species. Specifically, we assessed the among-population
variance of tissue-specific patterns of gene expression (in
brain, heart and liver) in the teleost fish Fundulus heteroclitus. A cDNA microarray was used to measure levels of expression in normal healthy male fish for 192 genes involved in
central metabolic pathways. We used this compact array in
order to impose a high degree of technical and biological replication (24 replicates for each of three tissues from nine individuals with two samples per array). Also, this array was used
because metabolic genes are essential, are known to have tis-

expression among individuals or tissues. Analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was used as a statistical test to determine which
genes were differentially expressed among tissues and populations. Tissue-specific patterns of gene expression were compared among populations. As expected, we detected extensive
variation in gene expression among tissues. Unexpectedly,
only a fraction (31%) of tissue-specific differences was conserved between all populations.

Nearly half of genes (92 genes, 48%) were differentially
expressed (p < 0.05) among individuals within populations

Many expected tissue-specific patterns emerged. For example, the brain-specific fatty-acid-binding protein was typically
more highly expressed in the brain than in other tissues (p =
0.005), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha (a transcription
factor) was more highly expressed in liver than in other tissues (p < 0.001), and two genes involved in glycerolipid
metabolism -lipoprotein lipase and phopholipase XIII A2 -

refereed research

Although variation among individuals was high, added variation due to tissues was significant. Considering 192 genes and
a p-value of 5%, one would expect less than 10 false-positive
differences among tissues under the null hypothesis. We
detected 76% of genes (146 of 192 genes) differentially
expressed among brains, hearts and livers (ANOVA, p <
0.05). Selecting the α level at which differences between
treatments are considered significant is problematic because
of the large number of comparisons performed. As such, we
present a volcano plot to illustrate the range of expression differences between tissues and associated p-values (Figure 2).
When α is set at 0.01, 0.001 or at the Bonferroni-corrected
value (2.6 × 10-4), the proportion of significant genes is 67%
(129 genes), 50% (96) and 39% (75), respectively. Significant
differences in expression ranged from less than 1.2-fold to
nearly 16-fold (Figure 2). The predominant pattern of tissuespecific expression can be described by expression significantly different in the liver compared to the other two tissues
(Figure 3).

were more highly expressed in liver than other tissues (p <
0.001 for both genes).
Liver-specific expression accounted for 61% of the expression
differences among tissues (Figure 4). Heart-specific and
brain-specific expression accounted for 24% and 15% of differences among tissues, respectively. Regardless of
population, expression patterns were typically most similar
between heart and brain, and least similar between liver and
heart (Figure 5). There were 67 genes printed on the array
that code for proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation,
and 88% (59 genes) were differentially expressed between tissues (genes highlighted in green, Figure 3). Of differentially
expressed oxidative phosphorylation genes, only 10% (six
genes) were expressed more highly in the liver than in other
tissues, whereas the remaining 90% (53 genes) had lower
expression in the liver compared to brain or heart.

Variation among taxa
A small proportion of genes (six genes, 3%) differed in expression among populations (p < 0.05). However, it should be
noted that although the split-plot design is powerful for
detecting differences between split-plot factors (tissues), it is
considered to have low power for detecting differences
between blocks (populations) [18]. As such, it is likely that 3%
is an underestimate of true among-population differences in
gene expression. Indeed, two-way ANOVA (data not shown),
which has higher power for detecting population differences
but is less valid than the split-plot model for testing individual
and tissue differences, detected among-population differences in expression for 18% of genes at p < 0.05, or 6.3% of
genes at p < 0.01. Each tissue contributed a similar number of
genes differentially expressed among populations.

Surprisingly, differences among tissues in gene expression
were not consistent across all three populations. More than
one-third (37%) of the genes differentially expressed between
tissues were significant in only one of the three populations
(Figure 6). Population-specific differences were distributed
among the three populations; Georgia had 40% of the population-specific genes, and New Jersey and Maine had 34%
and 26%, respectively. A proportion of these inconsistencies
could be due to false-positive or false-negative differences
between tissues in individual populations. However, statistically significant interaction between tissue and population
was detected for many (30%) of these inconsistencies (see
Additional data file 1).
A relatively small proportion of tissue-specific genes (31%)
have consistent expression patterns in all three populations
(Figure 6; also see Additional data file 1 for details). This subset of genes also reflects the different metabolic status of
brain, heart and liver; most of the genes involved in oxidative

Variation among technical replicates was low, and permutation tests indicated that the ANOVA model was robust. Sample coefficients of variation (CVs (standard deviation/mean)
× 100), which estimate technical variance due to replicate
spots (six spots per hybridization), repeated measures (two
hybridizations per dye), and dye (two dyes per sample), were
calculated for each gene of each of the 27 samples. CVs less
than 5% accounted for 95% of sample/genes, respectively. Of
the many comparisons performed (differences among tissues,
populations, interaction), permutation tests results agreed
with ANOVA results (the same comparisons identified as significant or not significant) for 99.1% of comparisons, suggesting that our ANOVA model was robust.

Discussion

Considerable variation occurs among the 27 samples (three
tissues from each of three individuals from three populations)
used to measure inter-individual and tissue-specific variation
in gene expression. We are able to precisely describe the patterns of gene expression for 192 metabolic genes because of
the low experimental variation; for 95% of the replicate measures of gene expression the standard deviation is less than 5%
of the mean. Notably, gene expression is statistically different
for many genes among individuals within a population for a
tissue (48%), between tissues (76%), and between populations (3%). For genes with tissue-specific expression, only a
fraction (31%) had expression patterns consistent across all
three populations. These data do not specifically identify tissue-specific differences that are inconsistent across popula-

refereed research

A variety of factors can contribute to differences in gene
expression among individuals. Pritchard et al. [21] proposed
that differences in immune status may explain the 3.3% difference in gene expression among genetically identical mice.
Sex explained a large portion of among-individual variation
in gene expression in Drosophila, whereas genotype was less
of an influence, and the influence of age was weak [4]. Furthermore, this type of variation can be biologically relevant.
For example recent work in Fundulus indicates that most
inter-individual variation in metabolism can be accounted for
by differences in metabolic gene expression [19].

deposited research

Considering the high inter-individual variation detected, the
data presented here underscore the importance of including
biological replicates within treatment groups in order to
ascribe differences in expression to treatment rather than to
inter-individual variation. Statistically, an analysis of variance can be used to examine the effects of technical and biological variation, and these tests have proved powerful for
detecting significant differences in gene expression [3,4],
even differences as small as 1.2-fold. The cost of resources in
microarray experiments should no longer excuse lack of biological and technical replication. Often, microarray experiments pool individual samples within treatment groups to
capture biological variation. However, this approach only
estimates an average level of expression and fails to estimate
biological variation. When only small quantities of RNA can
be extracted from samples, one can estimate biological variation by pooling multiple independent samples [20].

reports

Other studies that have measured inter-individual differences
in gene expression have also detected high levels of variation
in a variety of taxa. Among crosses of different yeast strains a
large number of differences in expression (6% of genes varying more than twofold) were detected between morphotypes
[1]. A previous study of the same Maine and Georgia Fundulus populations assayed here detected 18% of genes differentially expressed among healthy individuals [3]. Although
inter-individual variance in gene expression seems prevalent,
our observation that 48% of genes are differentially expressed
among individuals is high. This may reflect the greater precision of these measurements as a result of extensive technical
replication (24 replicate measures per sample) as coefficients
of variation for technical replicates was less than 5% for 95%
of the genes. Indeed, using similar methods and tools, a concurrent study assessing variation in Fundulus also detected a
very high proportion of genes (94%) differentially expressed

among individuals [19]. Alternatively, since our array is heavily biased toward metabolic genes, detected variance may also
reflect a greater variation in metabolic gene expression. We
could speculate that the high variation in metabolic genes
reflects a greater allowable variation. That is, there may be
less selective pressure to constrain metabolic variation either
because varying the amount of an enzyme does not affect
metabolism or variation in metabolism is phenotypically
acceptable. One could test this by using an array with more
comprehensive representation of the genome and comparing
variances of different gene classes defined by function.

reviews

Variation in gene expression among healthy male individuals
raised under controlled laboratory conditions was high.
Nearly half of the metabolic genes (48%) were differentially
expressed among individuals within a population for any one
tissue (Figure 1), with fold differences ranging from 1.2- to 5fold and p-values ranging down to 10-7. Differences in gene
expression among individuals are unlikely to be due to common reversible environmental factors that affect physiological performance (acclimation effects) since all individuals
used in this study were housed in a common environment and
fed the same food for at least two months. However, the differences could be due to irreversible developmental effects or
genetic variations that affect gene expression. Regardless of
this, if these differences are heritable or due to developmental
plasticity, they represent variation one would expect to find
among outbred organisms, including humans.

comment

tions, but rather emphasize that tissue-specific differences
detected can vary from one population to another. When
measured from a single population, highly significant differences in tissue-specific expression do not necessarily represent genes relevant to general functional or morphological
differences between tissues.

biological contexts, and scaling for differences among arrays
using expression levels of these genes ought to be approached
with caution.
Although genes differentially expressed among tissues reflect
their different metabolic requirements, it should be noted
that the purpose of the current study was not to
comprehensively identify suites of genes responsible for
functional differences between tissues. The relatively small
number of printed probes was useful for a high degree of technical replication, and obviously represents a small portion of
the expressed genes. However, this approach shows that
highly significant differences in gene expression among tissues may be apparent but not consistent among closely
related taxa. Therefore, highly significant differences in gene
expression found only within a single population may not
necessarily represent genes relevant to general functional or
morphological differences between tissues.

An unexpected finding is that the tissue-specific differences
depend on which population was assayed. Differences in gene
expression are expected between tissues because of functional divergence and between populations because of neutral
genetic divergence. In addition, one might expect that the
number of genes significantly different between populations
would depend on the tissue. One might also expect tissue-specific differences to be consistent in all taxa. Yet our data indicate that tissue-specific expression patterns are not fixed
within a species. The genes for which expression is significantly different between tissues are not all the same in all
three populations. Of the 128 genes that have tissue-specific

Although the pattern of metabolic gene expression among tissues reflects established patterns of tissue-specific metabolism, there is additional variation due to population. It should
be noted that the split-plot statistical design is not as powerful
for detecting among-block differences (among populations)
as for detecting differences among split-plot factors [18]. We
detected 3% of genes (6 of 192) differentially expressed
among populations. This proportion is similar to that
detected in a previous study [3] in which 2.6% of genes were
differentially expressed between Maine and Georgia Fundulus hearts. Similarly, approximately 1% of genes were differentially expressed in brain tissue among inbred strains of
mice [2]. Differences in gene expression are to be expected
among taxa (phylogenetically distinct groups of organisms
which may include strains, populations or species), with the
majority of differences most likely to be attributable to random genetic drift. For more distantly related groups, one
would expect expression patterns to be more divergent than
for closely related groups. Indeed, expression patterns
between humans and chimpanzees are more similar than
those between humans and orangutans, and similar results
were obtained from comparisons among three mouse species
[5,6].

Many microarray studies have used expression levels of
'housekeeping' genes as an internal control for comparisons
among arrays, individuals and treatments. Housekeeping
genes may be defined as those that are involved in routine
cellular metabolism and always expressed in all cells.
Accordingly, many, if not most, of the genes studied here
could be considered housekeeping genes. Nearly half of these
genes were expressed at different levels between individuals,
with fold differences ranging from 1.2- to 5-fold and p-values
ranging down to 10-7. Lee et al. [24] applied ANOVA to screen
four previously published datasets for housekeeping genes
across a variety of biological contexts. They found that all
genes that are commonly used as controls had fold changes
ranging from greater than 2.0 to more than 300 within at
least one dataset, and coefficients of variation were concordantly high, reflecting high variance in expression of these
genes. It appears that upon application of ANOVA, statistically significant differences in expression of housekeeping
genes can be detected among individuals and across different

comment

Another important source of biological variation in gene
expression is differences in expression among different tissues; 76% of genes were differentially expressed between
brain, heart and liver, and expression in the liver was the most
distinct compared to heart and brain. In this study, genes
printed on our array are primarily enzymes functional in central metabolic pathways such as fatty-acid metabolism, glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Of the oxidative
phosphorylation genes differentially expressed between tissues, 92% were more highly expressed in heart or brain than
in liver (Figure 3). The primary purpose of the heart is to act
as a pump, and contraction is highly dependent on oxidative
metabolism [22]. The metabolic rate in the brain is 7.5 times
the average rate in the rest of the body [23]. High metabolic
demand in the brain supports pumping of ions across neuronal membranes during action potentials and metabolism is
primarily oxidative. Mitochondria are the principal sites for
oxidative phosphorylation, and are most numerous in heart,
brain and skeletal muscle cells. The liver, in contrast, is much
more functionally diverse, as it is involved in carbohydrate
storage, synthesis of proteins, glucose, fatty acids, cholesterol
and lipids, and metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous
compounds, and has a relatively low respiration rate. Accordingly, transcripts of genes functional in oxidative phorphorylation appear to represent a much smaller portion of the
cell's RNA transcripts in liver tissues than in the heart or
brain. In addition, genes involved in fatty acid and
phospholipid synthesis were more highly expressed in liver
than the other tissues. Differences in expression among tissues detected using our array appear to reflect differences in
the metabolic status of brain, heart, and liver. Because data
presented here support well established patterns of metabolism, they suggest that measuring mRNA expression using
microarrays accurately reflects changes in proteins and their
phenotypic effect.

patterns of expression in any population, 37% are tissue-specific in only one of the three populations and 32% are found
in only two of the three populations. Overall, it would appear
that only 31% of tissue-specific differences in gene expression
are consistent among all populations of F. heteroclitus. One
needs to be careful about this interpretation, however. Our
emphasis was not to specifically identify genes that have significant interaction between tissue and population. Rather,
we emphasize that genes detected as tissue specific will vary
from one population to another, and most microarray studies
measure treatment-specific expression patterns in only one
population of test organism. Because inter-individual variation is high, it is probable that inclusion of more replicate
individuals in each group would increase the sensitivity of
ANOVA, and the number of genes that distinguish tissues
consistently in all populations may change.
The consistent tissue-specific differences still support expectations based on the metabolic requirements of each tissue
(for example, genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation
were more highly expressed in heart and brain, and those
involved in fatty-acid and lipid metabolism were more highly
expressed in the liver; Figure 7a). Accordingly, those differences in expression that are consistent across several groups
of organisms are most likely to account for functional and
morphological differences among tissues, emphasizing that
this type of comparative approach may be powerful for testing
the biological relevance of other functional traits. For example, expression differences between diseased and non-diseased tissues may vary among mouse strains, so that the
subset of differences that are consistent across strains are
more likely to be functionally related to the diseased state.
Our data suggest that many of the differences in gene expression detected between experimental groups may be of little
functional importance because they vary among taxa. We
suggest that patterns of expression that are consistent in different populations are more likely to be functionally important. Elucidation of adaptively important variation, such as
variation related to antibiotics, pesticides or temperature
adaptation, may also benefit from such a comparative
approach that screens for conserved patterns. However, there
is the possibility that partitioning of genetic polymorphisms
among populations may allow distinct groups of organisms to
reach different physiological or biochemical solutions to the
same biological challenges. For example, patterns of polymorphism in a gene that regulates coat color in mammals
indicated recent directional selection and was associated with
coat color in one pocket mouse population, but not in a
second population [25]. Other loci were probably responsible
for adaptive variation in coat color in the second population.

Conclusions

These data indicate high variation in metabolic gene expression among individuals and thus expression of these

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/2/R13

housekeeping genes is unreliable as an internal control or as
a method of normalization across samples. Second, concordance between tissue-specific expression patterns and established metabolic functions of brain, heart and liver indicate
that measuring mRNA levels accurately reflects physiological
status. Furthermore, since many metabolic genes differ in
expression among brain, heart and liver, those studies using
whole organisms need to rule out whether changes in expression reflect differences in the proportions of various tissues
among samples. Finally, studies seeking to identify patterns
of gene expression related to physiological states, such as disease or toxic stress, must consider both variation between
individuals and differences between populations. Because of
this biological variation, not all differences between treatments in any one population of test organism are likely to be
generally relevant. We suggest that conserved patterns of
treatment-specific gene expression among taxa are most
likely to be functionally related to the physiological state in
question.

Methods and materials
Animals and maintenance
Teleost fish Fundulus heteroclitus were collected from the
field by seine and minnow trap in June 2003, transported to
the University of Miami RSMAS laboratory under controlled
temperature and aeration conditions, and acclimated to
common conditions (20°C, 15 parts per thousand salinity) in
recirculating 100-gallon tanks for at least two months before
experiments. Fish were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and
tissues were excised and stored in RNAlater (Ambion) at
-20°C. Fish were collected at Wiscasset, Maine; Stone Harbor, New Jersey, and Sapelo Island, Georgia. Only healthy
male fish were used for the following experiments.

Microarrays
Microarrays were printed using 192 cDNAs from a F. heteroclitus cardiac library encoding essential proteins for cellular
metabolism [26]. These cDNAs were a subset of over 40,000
expressed sequences in our online database Funnybase [27].
These 192 cDNAs were amplified with amine-linked primers
and printed on 3-D Link Activated slides (Surmodics) using a
SpotArray Enterprise piezoelectric microarray printer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at Louisiana State University. Slides
were blocked following slide manufacturer protocols. The
suite of 192 amplified cDNAs was printed as a group in six
spatially separated replicates. Four hybridization zones of
these six replicate arrays were printed per slide, with each
zone set separated by a hydrophobic barrier.

Hybridization experimental design
Microarray analyses were applied to three tissues (brain,
heart and liver) from three individuals collected from three
populations of F. heteroclitus. Each of these 27 samples was
measured four times, twice with Cy3 and twice with Cy5 (Figure 8). In addition, since a hybridization zone covered six rep-

Raw data were first sum normalized [30], which involves
summing the total signal from each replicate array to the
same value. Then spatial bias on each array was smoothed
using a lowess transformation in MAANOVA Version 0.93-2

RNA for hybridization was prepared by amplification using a
modified Eberwine protocol [28]. The Ambion Amino Allyl
MessageAmp aRNA Kit was used (according to manufacturer's protocols) to copy template RNA by T7 amplification
following incorporation of a T7 promoter, resulting in amplified template in the form of antisense RNA. Amino-allyl UTP
was incorporated into targets during T7 transcription, and
resulting amino-allyl antisenseRNA was coupled to Cy3 and
Cy5 dyes (Amersham Biosciences).

Labeled aRNA aliquots of the two individual samples for each
hybridization (18 pmol each of Cy3 and Cy5) were vacuum
dried together and resuspended in 12 µl hybridization buffer
(final concentration of each labeled sample = 1.5 pmol/µl).
Hybridization buffer consisted of 5 × SSPE, 1% SDS, 50% formamide, 1 mg/ml poly(A), 1 mg/ml sheared herring sperm
carrier DNA, and 1 mg/ml BSA. Slides were washed in sodium
borohydride solution according to Raghavachari et al. [29] to
reduce autofluorescence. Following rinsing, slides were
boiled for 2 min and spin-dried in a centrifuge at 800 rpm for
3 min. Samples (12 µl) were heated to 90°C for 2 min, quick
cooled to 42°C, applied to slide (hybridization zone area was
350 mm2), and covered with a coverslip. Slides were placed in
an airtight chamber humidified with paper soaked in 1 × SSC
buffer and incubated 12-18 h at 42°C. Following hybridization, slides were scanned using the Packard Bioscience
ScanArray Express microarray scanner (PerkinElmer Life
Sciences). Resulting .tiff images were imported into spot grids
built in ImaGene (Biodiscovery) for each array, and spot
signals were collected as fluorescence intensities for each dye
channel.

RNA was extracted from tissue homogenate in a chaotropic

EDTA pH 8.0, 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 M β-mercaptoethanol, 2% antifoam A). An equal volume of 2 M sodium acetate
(pH 4.0) was added to the homogenate, followed by 400 µl
acidic phenol (pH 4.4), and 120 µl chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (23:1). The mixture was kept at 4°C for 10 min then centrifuged at 4°C at 16,000g for 20 min. Supernatant was
removed and combined with 400 µl isopropanol, stored at 20°C for 30 min, then centrifuged at 4°C at 16,000g for 30
min. The remaining RNA pellet was rinsed twice with 400 µl
of 70% ethanol, then further purified using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocols.
Purified RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically, and
RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.

Cy3 and Cy5) represent the three levels of technical variance
nested within the tissue-by-population sample. The ANOVA
structure is presented in Figure 9 and Table 2, and the model
can be written as:
y = grand mean + population + tissue + population-tissue
interaction + individual in population + tissue-by-individual
within population + dye within individual + hybridization
within dye + spot within hybridization
where y is the normalized log2 expression and individual in
population and tissue-by-individual within population are
random effects. To test for differences among multiple means
(for example, among population and tissue groups), and to
correct for multiple comparisons, the T-method [36] was
applied. The T-method calculates the minimum significant
range defined as:

MSR = Qα[kv] × SE
where the critical value Qα[kv] is the studentized range [37], k
= number of groups in the comparison (for example, if comparisons are among tissues then k = 3), v = degrees of freedom
of MStissue-by-individual within population, and SE is the standard
error among tissue-by-individual samples within populations. The T-method following ANOVA was used to identify
genes differentially expressed among tissues in each population. These data were then used to contrast tissue-specific and
population-specific expression patterns. Robustness of
ANOVA data was tested using a permutation test; means for
the 27 biological samples were randomly permuted 1,000
times between population and tissue and test statistics were
recalculated for differences among populations, tissues and
tissue-by-population interaction. Agreement between
ANOVA and permutation test results would indicate the
robustness of the ANOVA model. Finally, in order to graphi-
