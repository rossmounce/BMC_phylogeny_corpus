The origin of multicellularity in cyanobacteria
Bettina E Schirrmeister1*, Alexandre Antonelli2,3, Homayoun C Bagheri1

Abstract
Background: Cyanobacteria are one of the oldest and morphologically most diverse prokaryotic phyla on our
planet. The early development of an oxygen-containing atmosphere approximately 2.45 - 2.22 billion years ago is
attributed to the photosynthetic activity of cyanobacteria. Furthermore, they are one of the few prokaryotic phyla
where multicellularity has evolved. Understanding when and how multicellularity evolved in these ancient
organisms would provide fundamental information on the early history of life and further our knowledge of
complex life forms.
Results: We conducted and compared phylogenetic analyses of 16S rDNA sequences from a large sample of taxa
representing the morphological and genetic diversity of cyanobacteria. We reconstructed ancestral character states
on 10,000 phylogenetic trees. The results suggest that the majority of extant cyanobacteria descend from
multicellular ancestors. Reversals to unicellularity occurred at least 5 times. Multicellularity was established again at
least once within a single-celled clade. Comparison to the fossil record supports an early origin of multicellularity,
possibly as early as the “Great Oxygenation Event” that occurred 2.45 - 2.22 billion years ago.
Conclusions: The results indicate that a multicellular morphotype evolved early in the cyanobacterial lineage and
was regained at least once after a previous loss. Most of the morphological diversity exhibited in cyanobacteria
today —including the majority of single-celled species— arose from ancient multicellular lineages. Multicellularity
could have conferred a considerable advantage for exploring new niches and hence facilitated the diversification
of new lineages.

Background
Cyanobacteria are oxygenic phototrophic prokaryotes
from which chloroplasts, the light harvesting organelles
in plants, evolved. Some are able to convert atmospheric
nitrogen into a form usable for plants and animals. During Earth history, cyanobacteria have raised atmospheric
oxygen levels starting approximately 2.45 - 2.22 billion
years ago and provided the basis for the evolution of
aerobic respiration [1-7]. Cyanobacteria have also
evolved extensive morphological diversity. Various
patterns of cell organization exist, ranging from singlecelled to differentiated multicellular forms with branching patterns. Species of this phylum occupy various
habitats. They can be found in marine, freshwater or
terrestrial environments, ranging from polar to tropical
climate zones. Based on their morphology, they have
been divided into five sections [8,9] (Table 1). Sections I

and II comprise single-celled bacteria, whereas sections
III to V comprise multicellular forms. The latter sections are distinguished according to their level of organization. Section III is multicellular and undifferentiated,
sections IV and V are multicellular and differentiated.
The latter have the ability to produce heterocysts for
nitrogen fixation and akinetes (climate-resistant resting
cells). In addition, species in section V have the ability
to branch in multiple dimensions.
Different interpretations of multicellularity are currently used [10-12]. For cyanobacteria, characterization
of multicellularity has been described in previous studies
[13-16]. Cell to cell adhesion, intercellular communication, and for more complex species, terminal cell differentiation seem to be three essential processes that
define multicellular, prokaryotic organisms on this planet [16]. Some forms of complexity found in several
multicellular eukaryotes are not present in prokaryotes,
but simple forms of multicellularity can be identified in
three sections of the phylum cyanobacteria. Multicellular
patterns comprise basic filamentous forms as found for

section III, as well as more complex forms involving
terminal differentiation, present in sections IV and V. In
eukaryotes, multicellular complexity ranges from what is
comparable to cyanobacteria to cases with up to 55 cell
types as estimated for higher invertebrates such as
arthropods or molluscs [17]. Considering that cyanobacterial sections III, IV and V resemble some of the first
forms of multicellular filaments on Earth, knowing
when and how these shapes evolved would further our
understanding of complex life forms.
Some of the oldest body fossils unambiguously identified as cyanobacteria have been found in the Kasegalik
and McLeary Formations of the Belcher Subgroup,
Canada, and are evaluated to be between 1.8 billion and
2.5 billion years old [6,18]. Studies from ~ 2.0 billion

year old formations [18,19] contain both unicellular and
multicellular morphotypes of cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria certainly existed as early as 2.32 billion years ago,
if one accepts the assumption that they were responsible
for the rapid accumulation of oxygen levels, known as
the “Great Oxygenation Event” [1-3,5,7]. Multicellular
fossils belonging to the cyanobacteria are well known
from the late Precambrian [12,20,21] and possibly
already existed 2.32 billion years ago. Other microbelike multicellular filaments even older than 3.0 billion
years have been found several times [22-26]. Some of
the latter fossils are morphologically similar to species
from the cyanobacterial order Oscillatoriales [27,28], but
no clear evidence has been adduced yet. Although
biogenicity of some of the oldest fossils has been

Schirrmeister et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:45
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/45

questioned [29,30], a large variety of bacteria including
anoxic phototrophs already existed by the time cyanobacteria evolved oxygenic photosynthesis [26]. Though
impressive for prokaryotes, the fragmentary fossil record
alone is not sufficient to disentangle the origin of cyanobacteria and their morphological phenotypes. Therefore,
additional methods such as phylogenetic analysis provide a promising possibility to gather further clues on
the evolution of such a complex phylum.
Phylogenetic analyses of cyanobacteria have gained in
quantity over the past 20 years [4,31-39]. These studies
have shown that morphological characterization does
not necessarily reflect true relationships between taxa,
and possibly none of the five traditional morphological
sections is monophyletic. Similar morphologies must
have evolved several times independently, but details on
this morphological evolution are scarce. Analyses assessing characteristics of cyanobacterial ancestors [37,39]
provide not only fundamental information on the history of cyanobacteria, but also on the evolution of life
forms in the Archean Eon.
If one studies phylogenetic relationships based on protein coding genes in bacteria, it is possible to encounter
the outcome of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) [40].
This issue is not as problematic for ribosomal DNA
[41]. Nonetheless, the problem could be potentially
reduced by analyzing datasets of concatenated conserved
genes. Identification of these genes for phylogenetic analyses is not without difficulty, and requires in an ideal
case comparison of complete genome data [42]. In cyanobacteria, many phylogenetic studies have concentrated
on specific clades or smaller subsets of known species in
this diverse phylum [39,43-48]. Therefore the genomic
data presently available are strongly biased towards certain groups. In particular, genomic studies in cyanobacteria have emphasized marine species from Section I.
Marine microphytoplankton (Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus) are a particularly well studied group
[43,45,47,48], reflected by 19 sequenced genomes out of
41 cyanobacterial genomes sequenced to date (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi, accessed in
January 2011). From species belonging to section III
only two genomes (Trichodesmium erythraeum and
Arthrospira platensis) are known. For sections IV (four
genomes known) and V (no genomes known) molecular
data are rare or missing. As genomic data accumulate,
promising phylogenomic approaches to cyanobacteria
are being established [37-39,47]. Despite these advances,
it is at present difficult to obtain sequences other then
16S rDNA to cover a representative sample of species
from all five sections.
The aim of this paper is to use molecular phylogenetic
methods to address the evolutionary history of cyanobacteria and the evolution of multicellularity. For this

Page 4 of 21

purpose, we established a phylogeny based on 16S
rDNA sequences belonging to 1,254 cyanobacterial taxa.
From that phylogeny we sampled 58 cyanobacterial taxa
that represent all main clades obtained and all five sections described by Castenholz et al. [8,9], and feature a
1:1 ratio of unicellular to multicellular species. We used
several methods to reconstruct the morphological evolution of ancestral lineages, and compared our results to
known fossil data. Since the fossil record is inconclusive
on the timing and taxonomic position of multicellular
cyanobacteria, our study provides independent evidence
on the first appearance and evolution of multicellularity
among the ancestors of living cyanobacteria.

Results and Discussion
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analyses of all identified cyanobacteria

To infer the evolution of multicellularity in cyanobacteria we carried out several phylogenetic analyses. To
ensure a correct taxon-sampling, a phylogeny containing
1,254 16S rDNA sequences of cyanobacteria obtained
from GenBank was reconstructed (Figure 1). Cyanobacterial morphotypes were assigned to four groups (A-D)
which correlate to the five sections described by Castenholz et al. [9]. Using this nomenclature, sub-groups in
the phylogeny were assigned to one of the four different
morphological groups (A-D) according to their dominant shape. In total 14 sub-groups were identified for
the phylogenetic tree. Five sub-groups consist of unicellular species from section I (A1-A5), two sub-groups are
composed of single celled section II bacteria (B1, B2),
four sub-groups are made up of multicellular species
belonging to section III (C1-C4) and two sub-groups
cover differentiated species from section IV and V (D1D2). One sub-group contains both species from section
I and III and is therefore designated as AC1. The phylogeny further contains six chloroplast genomes from the
eukaryotic phyla Glaucophyta, Rhodophyta and the division Chlorophyta. Chloroplast sequences branch close to
the bases and form a sister group to the cyanobacterial
sub-groups mentioned. Furthermore six different Eubacteria were included in the phylogeny. They appear to
form a distinct outgroup to the cyanobacteria and
chloroplasts.
Phylogenetic analyses to identify an outgroup

Rooted and unrooted phylogenetic analyses reconstructed with maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference and based on 16S rRNA gene sequences of 27
eubacterial species, including 5 cyanobacteria revealed
congruent results. Cyanobacteria form a monophyletic
group. Figure 2 shows the unrooted Bayesian consensus
tree which supports cyanobacterial monophyly with posterior probabilities (PP)/bootstrap values (BV) of 1.0/
100%. Phylogenetic trees constructed with an archaean

Figure 1 Phylogenetic tree of 1,254 cyanobacterial species. Maximum likelihood phylogram of cyanobacteria, based on GTR+G+I
substitution model. Six eubacterial species form an outgroup. The ingroup contains 1,254 cyanobacterial strains and six different chloroplast
sequences. Bootstrap values (> 50%) calculated from 100 re-samplings are displayed at the nodes. Colors define major morphological characters
in the groups. Yellow are single-celled cyanobacteria of section I; orange single-celled from section II; green are multicellular, undifferentiated
cyanobacteria from section III; blue are multicellular and differentiated bacteria from section IV; and pink from section V. Sections as described by
Castenholz 2001 [9]. Different sub-groups (AC1;A1-A5;B1, B2;C1-C4;D1-D2) are defined for the phylogeny. Nomenclature of groups correlates with
morphological sections as illustrated in the legend. From these sub-groups taxa were sampled for further analyses. A complete list with species
included in the analysis can be found in Additional File 7.

outgroup support cyanobacterial monophyly with PP/BV
of 1.0/98% (Additional File 1). In both cases, Plantomyces brasilienses and Chlamydia trachomatis, both
gram negative bacteria, form a sister group to the cyanobacteria. This does not agree with other studies
[49-52], where Deinococcus-thermus was suggested to be
the closest eubacterial relative to cyanobacteria. These
discrepancies may be due to a lack of information when
solely using 16S rRNA gene sequences for such distant
relations. Furthermore, our results confirm the basal
position of Gloeobacter violaceus, closest to the rest of
the eubacteria, as found elsewhere [51]. This supports
previous findings which state that Gloeobacter violaceus
diverged very early from cyanobacteria living today
[32,33,53,54]. Gloeobacter shows differences in cell

structure and metabolism that clearly distinguish it from
the rest of extant cyanobacteria [55,56]. It lacks thylacoid membranes and many genes from Photosystems I
and II. Phylogenetic relations of the other eubacterial
species show only weak support and are therefore not
discussed further.
We separately tested each of the 22 eubacterial species
originating from a diverse set of non-cyanobacterial
phyla, with a subset of the cyanobacteria (58 taxa). The
latter were chosen from the large dataset containing
1,254 taxa, and cover all sub-groups of the tree (Table
1). This subset was used for all subsequent phylogenetic
analyses. Though multicellular species seem to dominate
the known cyanobacteria, we chose to sample a taxa set
containing unicellular and multicellular morphotypes in

a 1:1 ratio. That way biases towards certain character
states would be excluded. Furthermore, taxa used in the
analyses should represent species from all five sections
described by Castenholz et al. [9]. Given our interest in
the base of the phylogeny, a greater number of taxa
were sampled from basal sub-groups. Due to a lack of
data available on GenBank at the present state of
research, efforts to build a phylogenetic reconstruction
of this size (58 species) using additional ribosomal protein sequences failed. But genomic data are accumulating (57 genomes in progress according to GenBank) and
will soon offer possibilities for further extensive analyses.
Results of six phylogenetic trees are displayed in
Figure 3 (Additional file 2: Newick format of all trees).
The majority of the trees exhibit a topology that agrees
with Figure 2, with the position of Gloeobacter violaceus
close to the outgroup. Strong differences are found in
group support within the trees. In 14 of the 22 trees,

three nodes could be identified which lead to three
clades, named here E (Entire five sections(A-D)), AC
and C (nomenclature as described for the large tree;
Figure 1). Gloebacter violaceus and Synechococcus P1 are
found at the base of the cyanobacterial phylogeny in 16
trees, from which 7 trees exhibit Gloeobacter violaceus
closest to the eubacterial outgroup.
In total 14 trees showed congruent topologies. From
the 14 eubacteria which have been used as an outgroup
in these trees, we chose Beggiatoa sp. as an outgroup for
further analyses because its 16S rRNA gene sequence
exhibits the shortest distance to the cyanobacteria.
Phylogenetic analyses of a cyanobacterial subset

Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences from
a subset of 58 cyanobacterial taxa were conducted using
maximum likelihood (Additional File 3) and Bayesian
inference (Figure 4). For taxa that diverged a long time
ago, there is a possibility of sequence saturation, in

Figure 3 Bayesian consensus trees of cyanobacterial subset using dierent eubacterial outgroups. Six out of 22 phylogenetic trees
reconstructed with Bayesian inference. For each tree an outgroup from a different eubacterial phylum was chosen. Posterior probabilities are
displayed at the nodes. Green color represents multicellular cyanobacteria from section III, green-yellow gradient covers species from unicellular
section I and multicellular section III, and purple depicts all five different morphological sections present in cyanobacteria. The majority of
outgroups exhibits a similar tree topology. For further analyses Beggiatoa sp. was selected as an outgroup.

Figure 4 Phylogenetic tree of a cyanobacterial subset. Bayesian consensus cladogram of 16S rDNA sequences from 58 cyanobacterial strains,
based on GTR+G+I substitution model, with Beggiatoa sp. used as outgroup. Posterior probabilities (> 0.9) are shown in black at nodes and
bootstrap values (> 50%) in red. Posterior probabilities were calculated from 265,858 trees and bootstrap values from 500 re-samplings of the
original data set. Colors define groups: yellow are single-celled cyanobacteria of section I; orange single-celled from section II; green are
multicellular, undifferentiated cyanobacteria from section III; blue are multicellular and differentiated bacteria from section IV; and pink from
section V. Sections as described by Castenholz 2001 [9]. AC, B, C, E and E1 denote phylogenetic clades described in the text.

which case further mutations would have no effect on
the distance between sequences any more. We could
significantly reject the possibility of sequence saturation
for our alignment (Additional File 4).
A general substitution model (GTR+G+I) was applied
for both analyses. Results of the maximum likelihood
and Bayesian methods are highly congruent. Result of
the Bayesian analysis with posterior probabilities (black)
and bootstrap values (red) displayed at the nodes is pictured in Figure 4. Posterior probabilities above 0.95 and
bootstrap values over 70% are considered to represent a
high phylogenetic support. Bootstrap values between
50% and 70% are considered weak support. Posterior
probabilities below 0.90 and bootstrap values below 50%
are not displayed. At deep nodes, the tree topology is

fully resolved with high posterior probabilities. Apart
from section V, none of the morphological sections
described by Castenholz et al. [9] is monophyletic.
Compared to the outgroup Beggiatoa sp., branch lengths
are relatively short, which seems surprising given the
old age of the phylum. Rates of evolution in cyanobacteria are extremely slow. This so called “hypobradytelic”
tempo would explain their short evolutionary distances
[20,57,58].
Cyanobacteria form three distinct clades mentioned
earlier (Figure 3). Clades E, AC and C exhibit posterior
probabilities (PP)/bootstrap values (BV) of 1.0/51%,
0.99/-, and 1.0/97% respectively (no support: “-”). Clade E
comprises all taxa analyzed from section II, some from
section I (Synechocystis, Microcystis, Gloeothece and

Schirrmeister et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:45
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/45

others), some from section III (Oscillatoria, Trichodesmium, Arthrospira, Lyngbya, Microcoleus, Spirulina and
others) and all from sections IV and V. Within clade E
two subclades, E1 (species from section II; PP/BV = 1.0/
81%) and B (species from sections IV and V among
others; PP/BV = 1.0/100%), are found. Clade AC contains
species from section I and III (among others, species
from the genera Synechococcus, Prochlorococcus, Oscillatoria, Plectonema). Clade C consists of Pseudanabaena
species, Arthronema gygaxiana and Phormidium mucicola belonging to section III. Gloeobacter violaceus is
placed closest to the outgroup. Several phylogenetic studies were conducted showing approximate agreement
with the tree topology generated here [4,31-39,54]. To
check the consistency of results from the maximum likelihood and Bayesian analysis to previous studies, we compare our results to the trees produced by Honda et al.
[32], Turner et al. [33] who used 16S rDNA sequences,
and Swingley et al. [38] who used a genomic approach.
The tree from Figure 2 in Honda et al. [32] shows
overall strong congruences with our tree. The only
exception is that in Honda et al. [32] “Synechococcus
elongatus Toray” is placed separately between Gloeobacter and the rest of the cyanobacteria. We found that
“Synechococcus elongatus Toray” (identical to Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP1) is located within clade AC
in our study and not next to Gloeobacter violaceus.
In Turner et al. [33], the major clades are congruent
with those inferred in our study, but there are a few differences in the relationships among these clades. In that
study, the analog of clade E1 is sister to clade AC,
which is not the case in our consensus tree. Furthermore, Synechococcus C9 is grouped with Synechococcus
P1, which might be due to long branch attraction. In
our phylogenetic tree, Synechococcus C9 is grouped
within clade AC, a relationship supported by high posterior probabilities and bootstrap values (1.0/99%). Clade
C in our study is placed in the same position as in the
tree from Turner et al. [33].
Swingley et al. [38], used a phylogenomic approach to
investigate cyanobacterial relationships. Due to limited,
biased genome data available at present, some clades
present in our tree are missing in that study. Even so,
the main clades retrieved in that study are mostly congruent with clades in our tree.
Monophyly of section V (the branching, differentiated
cyanobacteria) shown in our tree agrees with Turner et al.
[33] and other studies [36,54]. Nonetheless it is possible
that the monophyly of section V bacteria is due to limited
taxon sampling, since polyphyly has been detected for
section V in another study [59]. Gloeobacter violaceus
is placed as the first diverging lineage in the phylogeny
after the outgroup, as suggested by previous studies
[4,32-35,37,39,54]. Our phylogenetic reconstruction also

Page 9 of 21

confirms the placement of taxa belonging to section I and
III throughout the tree [4,31-37,39,54]. The finding that
possibly none of the traditional morphological sections are
monophyletic, clearly indicates that similar morphologies
have been gained and lost several times during the evolutionary history of living cyanobacteria. Overall, the strong
phylogenetic agreement between this and earlier studies
confirms the suitability of the tree presented here for
further analyses of morphological evolution.
Ancestral character state reconstruction

Our analysis indicates that multicellularity is a phylogenetically conservative character (p-value < 0.01). If the
terminal taxa of the Bayesian consensus tree are randomly re-shuffled, a count through 1,000 re-shuffled
trees gives an average of 20 transition steps. However an
average of only nine parsimonious transitions was
observed in a count through 10,000 randomly sampled
trees of our ancestral character state reconstruction.
Results of the character state reconstruction using the
AsymmMK model with transition rates estimated by
Mesquite 2.71 [60] are displayed in Figure 5. Using maximum likelihood analysis, average frequencies of the
characters were counted across 10,000 trees randomly
sampled from the two Metropolis-coupled Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MC3) searches of the Bayesian tree
reconstruction.
Cyanobacteria share a unicellular ancestor, but multicellularity evolved early in the cyanobacterial lineage.
We identified multicellular character states for three
basic ancestors leading to clades E, AC and C in our
tree. Together, these clades encompass the entirety of
the morphological sections II, III, IV and V. Additionally
character states were reconstructed using maximum
likelihood analysis and fixed transition rates to analyze
properties of the data set. Transition rates are presented
in Table 2. Probabilities for character states at nodes 3,
4 and 5 were examined in detail (Table 3). A multicellular ancestry is very likely for these three nodes. For
node 3 the relative probabilities of a multicellular ancestor range from 0.79 to 1.00, depending on the probability of the transition rates. For node 4 with varying
transition rates, the relative probabilities of a multicellular ancestor range from 0.83 to 1.00. For node 5 the
probabilities for multicellularity range from 0.90 to 1.00.
The maximum likelihood analysis is not contradicted
by a Maximum Parsimony optimization (Table 3 and
Additional File 5). Applying maximum parsimony as a
reconstruction method, the uniquely best states were
counted across 10,000 trees randomly sampled from the
two (MC3) runs of the Bayesian tree reconstruction. The
relative probabilities for a multicellular ancestor at
nodes 3, 4 and 5 are 0.68, 0.68 and 0.69, respectively. In
contrast, the relative probabilities for a unicellular

Figure 5 Ancestral character state reconstruction using maximum likelihood. Ancestral character state reconstruction with maximum
likelihood analysis, using the “Asymmetrical Markov k-state 2 parameter"(AsymmMk) model implemented in Mesquite 2.71 [60]. Transition rates
were estimated by the program (Table 2). Analysis was run over 10,000 randomly sampled trees from the Bayesian analysis and plotted on the
Bayesian consensus tree. Possible states are unicellular (yellow) and multicellular (black). Relative likelihood probabilities for each character state
are represented with a pie chart at nodes. The white part in the pie charts indicates the fraction of trees where the node was absent. Posterior
probabilities (black) and bootstrap values (red) from the phylogenetic analyses are displayed at the nodes. Asterisks denote supported nodes for
which posterior probabilities and bootstrap values are presented in Figure 4. At nodes 3, 4 and 5 a multicellular ancestry is very likely. Back
mutations to unicellularity occur at least five times. A back mutation to multicellularity occurs at least once. Clades where transitions occurred
are labelled.

ancestor at nodes 3, 4 and 5 under parsimony reconstruction are 0.0013, 0.0014 and 0.0014, respectively.
Using Bayesian methods, a similar pattern is observed
for these nodes. As an evolutionary model, BayesFactors
revealed that a “hyperprior” approach with exponential
prior distributions, whose means were sampled from a
uniform distribution between 0 and 10 gave the best fit.
Transition rates were estimated to be almost equal.
Figure 6 displays the posterior probability distributions of
character states at these three nodes as they were estimated over 10,000 randomly sampled trees. At nodes 3
and 5 posterior probabilities of a multicellular character
state display values above 0.90 for most of the trees. At
node 4 a multicellular state is more likely as well. Posterior
probabilities at node 4 are above 0.75 for most of the trees.
At least five reversals to unicellularity occurred in the
tree, three of them within clade AC. The first transition
occurred on a branch which led to a group of thermophilic cyanobacteria: Acharyochloris sp., Synechococcus
lividus C1 and Thermosynechococcus elongatus. Posterior
probabilities (PP) and bootstrap values (BV) for this
group are 0.99/73%, whereas the sister group within AC
is supported by 0.96/66% (PP/BV). The second transition within clade AC led also to a thermophilic

cyanobacterium Synechococcus C9. Sister relation of this
species to a filamentous thermophilic cyanobacterium is
supported by 1.0/99% (PP/BV). The last transition in
clade AC occurred within the group including the marine pico-phytoplankton genera Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus. The filamentous Prochlorothrix hollandica
is supposed to be the closest relative to the group that
includes marine pico-phytoplankton, supported by 1.0/
61% (PP/BV). Clade AC has a PP of 0.99, while its BV is
below 50%. Although bootstrap support is below 70%
for clade AC and some groups within it, posterior probabilities show a very high support (> 0.95). Simulation
studies have shown that posterior probabilities approach
the actual probability of a clade [61-63]. Bootstrapping
tends to underestimate the actual probability of a true
clade. Although, posterior probabilities tend to be erroneous if the model of evolution is underparameterized,
overparameterization has only a minor effect on the
posterior probabilities. Therefore, using a complex
model of evolution, such as the “general time reversible
with gamma distributed rate variation"(GTR+G), is
recommended [62,63]. We used the GTR+G+I model
for our analysis, and assume that nodes with a PP higher
than 0.95 are reliable.

Posterior Probability Density
Figure 6 Ancestral character states of nodes 3, 4 and 5 using Bayesian analysis. Posterior probability distribution for a unicellular character
state (yellow) and a multicellular character state (black) at nodes 3, 4 and 5 from 10,000 Bayesian trees. 2× 5,000 trees were randomly sampled
from 2 MC3-searches. Analysis was performed using BayesTraits. Posterior distributions were derived from reversible jump MCMC-search of 30
million iterations using a hyperprior approach. The probability of a multicellular ancestry is shifted towards 1 for each of the three nodes.

It is very likely that at least one additional reversal to
unicellularity occurred in clade E1, but phylogenetic
support is not high enough to locate the exact position
of this transition. Similarly, support for the nodes where
the other transition to multicellularity within clade E
occurred is missing. The exact locations of reversals
within clade E therefore are not certain and a scenario
where multiple reversals occurred cannot be excluded.
In clade E, there is also a reversal to multicellularity
observed in Spirulina sp. PCC 6313. The location of this
transition is supported by posterior probabilities of 0.99
at two ancestral nodes.
Stucken et al. [64] compared gene sets of multicellular
cyanobacteria and found that at least 10 genes are
essential for the formation of filaments. Besides genes
previously thought to be correlated with heterocyst formation (hetR, patU3 and hetZ) they found seven genes
coding for hypothetical proteins. The species they compare are all located within clade E in our tree, most of
them being differentiated. Unfortunately no genomes
from multicellular species in more basal clades are available at present. But genome projects of Phormidium sp.
ISC 31 and Plectonema sp. ISC 33 are presently being
conducted http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.
cgi. If these species turn out to group with Phormidium
mucicola IAM M-221 and Plectonema sp. F3 from the
basal clades C and AC in our study, this could provide

important information on the original metabolic pathways in ancient multicellular cyanobacteria and on possible advantages of multicellularity.
The majority of cyanobacteria living today are
described as successful ecological generalists growing
under diverse conditions [20]. Our analysis indicates that
this diverse range of cyanobacterial morphotypes found
in various habitats today —whether multicellular or unicellular— has evolved from multicellular ancestors.
Gaining and losing multicellularity

In eukaryotes, simple multicellular forms build the foundation for the evolution of complex multicellular organisms. Although complex multicellularity exhibiting more
than three cell types is presumably missing in prokaryotes, bacteria invented simple multicellular forms possibly more than 1.5 billion years earlier than eukaryotes
[24-26,65]. Multicellularity has been described as one of
several major transitions that occurred in the history of
life. These transitions between different units of selection [66] resulted in changes in the organizational confines of the individual. Maynard Smith and Szathmary
[67] (1995, p.6) summarize eight major transitions in
the evolution of life after which, “entities that were capable of independent replication before the transition can
replicate only as part of a larger whole after it”. These
transitions can create new units of selection at a higher

questioned [26,27,83], but for others biogenicity is very
likely [23,25,26,84-87]. These candidates for early life
have clear age constraints and there is no non-biological
explanation for these structures. The ages and possible
metabolic features of seven fossils of proposed biological
origin are plotted in Figure 7 (1-7) [23,25,26,84-87].
Some of these fossils are assumed to have been photosynthetic and mat builders, characteristics that can be identified in cyanobacteria as well. One of the oldest fossils
recorded, 3.45 billion year old prokaryotic remains found
in the Panorama Formation, East Pilbara Craton, Western Australia exhibit a filamentous morphotype and possibly carried out anoxygenic photosynthesis [25,26].
Some late Archean fossils show an oscillatorian or
chroococcacean morphotype (Figure 7: 8, 9). 2.52 and
2.56 billion year old oscillatorian-like fossils [24,88,89]
could possibly represent close relatives of cyanobacterial
ancestors. 2.72 billion year old filamentous bacteria [24]
could potentially represent one of the first multicellular
cyanobacteria detected. For single celled forms, 2.56 billion year old unicellular fossils [89-92] could likely
represent chroococcacean fossils, relatives of ancestral
Gloeobacter violaceus or Synechococcus sp. P1 (Figure 7).
The first conclusive cyanobacterial fossils from all five
sections have been reported from around 2.15 billion
year old rocks. In 1976, Hofmann described Microfossils
from stromatolitic dolomite stones in the Kasegalik and
McLeary Formations of the Belcher Supergroup in Hudson Bay, Northern Canada. Among these fossils
are Halythrix which seems to belong to the order Oscillatoriales (section III), Eosynechococcus and Entophysalis
both presumably order Chroococcales (section I) and
Myxococcoides fossils (section II). In 1997 similar fossils
were described by Amard and Bertrand-Safarti in

level of complexity [68]. Origin of chromosomes, origin
of the eukaryotic cell, origin of multicellular organisms
and the origin of eusocial communities are some major
transitions that redefine the degree of individuality
[66,67,69,70]. Some transitions are thought to be unique,
such as the evolution of meiosis or the evolution of the
genetic code. Other major transitions occurred several
times independently, such as the evolution of eusociality
[71,72] and multicellularity [10,66,73-75]. There is a tendency to assume that these transitions occur in a progression that leads to an increase in complexity.
However, it seems that in cyanobacteria this is not the
case. Anatomical complexity has been lost during their
evolution several times (Figure 5). In a similar fashion, a
complex character such as eusociality has been lost several times in halictid bees [72,76]. Conversely the phylogeny indicates that multicellularity re-evolved in
Spirulina. Regaining complex characters has been
observed in other studies as well [77-79]. Nonetheless,
some studies state that re-evolution of a complex character after a previous loss is not possible [80,81]. Such
studies argue that according to ‘Dollo’s law’, a loss of
complexity is irreversible [82], a statement that is not
supported in the cyanobacterial case. Repeated transitions in either direction are possible.
Prokaryotic fossil record before the “Great Oxygenation
Event": Evidence for multicellular cyanobacteria?

Various claims for life during the early Archean Eon,
more than 3.00 billion years ago exist. Most of them
from two regions: the Berberton Greenstone Belt, South
Africa (around 3.20-3.50 billion years old) and the Pilbara
Craton, Western Australia (around 2.90-3.60 billion years
old). For some of these “fossils” a biological origin is

Figure 8 Schematic illustration of cyanobacterial evolution. Numbers at the nodes indicate Bayesian posterior probabilities (black) and
bootstrap values (red) from the phylogenetic analyses. The most recent common ancestor of all cyanobacteria is optimized to have been
unicellular. All cyanobacteria derive from a unicellular most recent common ancestor (node 1). The lineage leading to Gloeobacter violaceus
diverges very early from the remaining cyanobacteria. Most major clades of cyanobacteria derive from multicellular ancestors (nodes 3-5).

paleoproterozoic cherty stromatolites from the “Formation C (FC)” of the Franceville Group in Gabon, dating
back 2.00 billion years. They also characterized chroococcalean fossils, particularly Eosynechococcus and Tetraphycus, and filamentous bacteria (Gunflinta) which
could likely resemble cyanobacteria and Myxococcoides
fossils. Furthermore, large microfossils (so called
Archaeoellipsoides elongatus), with akinetes similar to
the ones from Anabaena-like species were found [4,19].
Akinetes are resting cells which are only present in differentiated cyanobacteria from sections IV and V. As it
has been confirmed in several studies, sections IV and V
share a most recent common ancestor [4,33,36]. Therefore these fossil akinetes document the existence of differentiated cyanobacteria 2.00 billion years ago. Given
that differentiation in cyanobacteria is evolutionary
stable only in a multicellular setting [93], this again supports the notion that multicellular species belonging to
the cyanobacteria must have existed earlier than 2.0 billion years ago.
Several studies have assessed prokaryotic history using
phylogenetic dating methods [50,52]. In these studies the
origin of cyanobacteria has been estimated around the time
of the “Great Oxygenation Event” of 2.20-2.45 billion years
ago [2,7]. Other studies have reported elevations of oxygen
levels before the great rise of atmospheric oxygen [7,94].
Using small and large ribosomal subunit sequences, Blank
and Sanchez-Baracaldo [39] estimated the origin of cyanobacteria between 2.7 and 3.1 billion years ago. They also try
to address the evolution of cyanobacterial traits and assess
that multicellular cyanobacteria did not originate before
2.29-2.49 billion years ago. In the study of Blank and Sanchez-Baracaldo [39], a smaller set of cyanobacterial taxa
was used, with some basal multicellular species that are
present in clade C of our analysis missing. These taxa
could have an essential effect on the timing of the first multicellular cyanobacteria. To resolve this issue further dating
analyses would be needed. Clearly, as Blank and SanchezBaracaldo point out, for such analyses to ultimately resolve
the cyanobacterial history, a larger number of cyanobacterial genome data would be needed to represent all the morphological and genetic diversity within this phylum.

Conclusions
Cyanobacteria, photosynthetic prokaryotes, are one of
the oldest phyla still alive on this planet. Approximately
2.20-2.45 billion years ago cyanobacteria raised the
atmospheric oxygen level and established the basis for
the evolution of aerobic respiration [1-6]. They introduced a dramatic change in the Earth’s atmosphere,
which might have created possibilities for more complex
lifeforms to evolve. Considering the importance of cyanobacteria for the evolution of life, it seems unfortunate
that data sets for a representative phylogenomic analysis

Page 15 of 21

are not yet available. A coordinated perspective between
research groups and a diversified taxon sampling strategy for genome projects would offer the possibility for
more comprehensive studies on cyanobacterial evolution. By presenting results obtained from 16S rDNA
data analysis here, we hope to boost interest for more
extensive genomic studies in this phylum. Phylogenomic
approaches would help to further investigate some of
the results in the present work.
Multicellular prokaryotic fossils from the Archean Eon
are documented [25,26], and fossil data can support the
possibility of multicellular cyanobacteria in the Archean
Eon [24,88-90]. Furthermore, studies describe smaller
accumulations of oxygen levels around 2.8 to 2.6 billion
years ago [7] and around 2.5 billion years ago [94].
Therefore multicellular cyanobacteria could have
evolved before the rise of oxygen in the atmosphere.
The “Great Oxygenation Event”, also referred to as “oxygen crisis”, could presumably have marked one of the
first mass extinction events during Earth’s history. New
habitats developing around 2.32 billion years ago, due to
a dramatic change of Earth’s atmosphere could have
triggered cyanobacteria to evolve the variety of morphotypes preserved until today.
In terms of cell types, cyanobacteria reached their maximum morphological complexity around 2.00 billion
years ago [95]. By the time eukaryotes evolved, cyanobacteria already exhibited the full range of their morphological diversity. Due to slow evolutionary rates in
cyanobacteria, which have been described as “hypobradytelic” [20,57,58], extant cyanobacteria that appear to exhibit the same morphotype as in the Precambrian Eon [96]
are reminiscent of the idea of “living fossils”. However,
one should consider the possibility that what may appear
as morphological stasis may be due to developmental
constraints at the phylum level. Cyanobacteria apparently
reached their maximum complexity early in Earth history, but instead of morphological stasis at the species
level, our results suggest that they subsequently changed
morphotypes several times during their evolution. This
allowed for the exploration of diverse morphotypes
within their developmental constraints, including the loss
and regaining of multicellular growth forms.
Figure 8 summarizes the morphological evolution of
the cyanobacteria inferred in this study. All extant cyanobacteria share a most recent common ancestor that
was unicellular. Single-celled species at the base of the
tree do not seem to have changed much in their morphology and are possibly comparable to ancient cyanobacteria. Aside from Gloeobacter violaceus and
Synechococcus P1, which diverged very early, all cyanobacteria living today share multicellular ancestors.
Although complex multicellularity is missing in prokaryotes, these simple multicellular forms have evolved

several hundred million years before the appearance of
eukaryotes, whose fossil record dates back to 1.8-1.3 billion years ago [65]. In agreement with various proposed
selective advantages that multicellular growth could
confer [97-100], the results presented here indicate that
the early origin of multicellularity played a key role in
the evolutionary radiation that has led to the majority of
extant cyanobacteria on the planet.

Methods
Taxon sampling

A total of 2,065 16S rRNA gene sequences from the
phylum cyanobacteria were downloaded from GenBank.
Unidentified and uncultured species were excluded.
With this large dataset phylogenetic reconstructions
were conducted as described in the next section. Aside
from cyanobacteria, the dataset included six chloroplast
sequences and six eubacterial sequences: Beggiatoa sp.,
Thiobacillus prosperus, Agrobacterium tumefaciens,
Chlorobium sp., Candidatus Chlorothrix halophila and
Escherichia coli HS.
From this large tree a subset of 58 cyanobacterial
sequences were selected for further analyses. Accession
numbers are provided in Table 1. Species from all five
sections described by Castenholz et al. [9] were

included. Taxa were chosen to represent a 1:1 ratio of
unicellular and multicellular species. The final data set
contained 22 single-celled taxa from section I, 7 singlecelled taxa from section II, 21 multicellular taxa from
section III, 5 multicellular, differentiated taxa from section IV and 3 differentiated, branching taxa from section
V as described by Castenholz et al. [9].
An outgroup for further analyses was chosen from a
set of eubacterial, non-cyanobacterial species whose 16S
rRNA gene sequences were downloaded from GenBank
(Table 4). Species were sampled to cover a wide range
of different phyla. Aside a set of species from phyla
represented in the “tree of life” [51], species from additional phyla as described on NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/Taxonomy/ - Taxonomy Browser: Bacteria)
were selected for analyses.
Phylogenetic analyses
Phylogenetic analyses of all identified cyanobacteria

The 2,065 16S rRNA gene sequences were aligned using
the software MAFFT [101] via Cipres Portal [102]. The
alignment was corrected manually using BioEdit v7.0.5
[103]. Poorly aligned and duplicated sequences were
excluded from the alignment. From the remaining 1,254
sequences (1235 characters) a phylogenetic tree was

reconstructed running 10 maximum likelihood analyses as
implemented in RAxML v7.0.4 [104]. GTR + G + I (General time reversible model, G: Gamma correction, I: proportion of invariable sites) [105,106] was used as an
evolutionary substitution model. Bootstrap values were
calculated from 100 re-samplings of the dataset and
plotted on the best maximum likelihood tree using
RAxML v7.0.4. The resultant tree (Figure 1; Additional
File 6: newick format; Additional File 7: taxon names) was
visualised in FigTree v1.3.1 http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/ and graphically edited with Adobe Illustrator
CS2 http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator/.
Phylogenetic analyses to identify an outgroup

To test different outgroups, phylogenetic trees were
reconstructed using all sampled non-cyanobacterial species (Table 4) plus five representative species from the
cyanobacterial phylum (Table 1). Sequences were
aligned using Clustal-X with default settings [107] and
corrected manually. The trees were built using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference, with and without an outgroup from the kingdom archaea. Fifty
separate maximum likelihood searches were conducted
using RAxML v7.0.4 software [104], from which the tree
with the best log-likelihood was chosen. Bootstrap support for each tree was gathered from 100 re-samplings.
Bayesian analyses were conducted with MRBAYES 3.1
[108] using a GTR + G + I evolutionary model with
substitution rates, base frequencies, invariable sites and
the shape parameter of the gamma distribution estimated by the program. Two Metropolis-coupled Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MC 3 ) searches with four chains,
three heated and a cold one, were run. The analyses
started with a random tree and was run for 5,000,000
generations. Trees and parameters were sampled every
100th generation. The trees were checked to show a
standard deviation of split frequencies below 0.05. The
first 3,000,000 generations were excluded as the burn-in.
Additionally phylogenetic analyses were conducted
with Bayesian inference, using each of the 22 eubacterial
species separately with the sampled cyanobacterial subset (58 taxa). Alignments were built using Clustal-X
software with default settings [107] and corrected manually. For each phylogenetic analysis two (MC3) searches
were run for 10,000,000 generations using MRBAYES
3.1 [108]. Trees and parameters were sampled every
100th generation. The first 3,000,000 generations being
excluded as a burn-in, assuring that the standard deviation of split frequencies were below 0.05 and log-likelihoods of the trees had reached stationarity. Results were
compared and Beggiatoa sp. was chosen as an outgroup
for further analyses.
Phylogenetic analyses of a cyanobacterial subset

Sequence alignments of the 16S rRNA gene sequences
from the cyanobacterial subset and Beggiatoa sp. (59

Page 17 of 21

taxa, 1166 characters) were carried out using Clustal-X
with default settings [107] and corrected manually.
Whether the cyanobacterial alignment (excluding the
outgroup) was substitutionally saturated was tested
using the program DAMBE [109,110]. The informationentropy based index of substitutional saturation [111]
was used to analyze our alignment of 16S rRNA gene
sequences. The test performs only on a maximum of 32
species. Therefore we sampled from our phylogeny 32
representative sequences that span the whole tree, and
performed the test introduced by Xia et al. [111](Table
1 and Additional File 4).
Phylogenetic reconstruction was carried out using
Bayesian analysis and maximum likelihood. Maximum
likelihood analysis was performed using GARLI 0.96
[112] and Bayesian analysis was conducted with
MRBAYES 3.1 [108]. The evolutionary model of nucleotide substitution that best fitted the data was obtained
by using the Akaike Information Criterion as implemented in Modeltest 3.5 [113]. The selected model was
GTR + G + I. Substitution rates, base frequencies,
invariable sites and the shape parameter of the gamma
distribution were estimated by the program. Fifty maximum likelihood searches were performed. Bootstrap
values were calculated from 500 re-samplings of the
data set. The bootstrap values were plotted on the best
ML-tree using the program SumTrees [114] (Additional
File 3).
Bayesian analysis was conducted running two (MC3)
searches, each with four chains, one cold and three
heated. Starting with a random tree, analyses were run
for 16,616,000 generations each, with trees being
sampled every 100th generation. The trees were checked
for convergence of parameters (standard deviation of
split frequencies below 0.01, effective sample sizes above
200, potential scale reduction factor equal to 1.0) using
Tracer v1.4.1 [115] and the program AWTY [116].
Burn-in was set to 3,323,200 generations each, corresponding to the first 20% of the analyses. The average
standard deviation of split frequencies was below 0.01
for the remaining 132,929 trees of each run, indicating
that steady state of the log-likelihoods was reached.
Ancestral character state reconstruction

Character state reconstructions were performed using
maximum parsimony (MP; Additional File 5) and maximum likelihood criteria as implemented in Mesquite
2.71 [60]. 5,000 trees from each MC 3 run were randomly chosen from the post burn-in Bayesian sample
and combined. Discrete characters were coded into multicellular or unicellular states. The results over 10,000
Bayesian trees were summarized and displayed on the
consensus tree of the Bayesian analysis. For maximum
likelihood estimates, both the “Markov k-state 1

Schirrmeister et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:45
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/45

parameter model” (MK1 model) and “Asymmetrical
Markov k-state 2 parameter model” (AsymmMK model)
were applied. Rate of change is the only parameter in
the MK1 model. The AsymmMK model exhibits two
parameters, describing the forward and backward transitions between states. Phylogenetic conservativeness of
multicellularity was tested by comparing the observed
distribution of parsimony steps across 10,000 randomly
chosen trees from the Bayesian analysis against the distribution from 1,000 trees modified from the Bayesian
consensus by randomly shuffling the terminal taxa,
while keeping the relative proportion of states unaltered.
The root was assumed to be at equilibrium. Transition
rates for the MK1 and AsymmMK model were estimated by the program. Rates for the latter models presented in Table 2 were estimated for the consensus tree.
To explore properties of the data set, character states
were additionally reconstructed with manually fixed
transition rates (F1-F6; Table 2). The state of the outgroup was excluded from the analyses to avoid biased
inferences within the ingroup.
The character states of nodes 3, 4 and 5 of the Bayesian consensus tree were additionally estimated using a
reversible jump MCMC search as implemented in
BayesTraits [117]. MCMC was run for 30 million iterations, and a burnin set to 50,000. The analysis was run
several times with parameters of the evolutionary model
being chosen from different prior distributions. In order
to determine which model offered the best fitting priors,
models were tested using Bayes Factors. A hyperprior
approach with mean-values of the exponential priors
derived from a uniform distribution between 0 to 10
was determined to fit best the data. The results of the
analysis were visualized in Tracer v1.5 [115].

Additional file 4: Results from the test of substitutional saturation.
Substitutional saturation of the sequences was tested using DAMBE
software. The index of substitutional saturation is smaller than the
estimated critical value irrespective of the symmetry of the tree. The
sequences are therefore not saturated.
Additional file 5: Ancestral character state reconstruction using
maximum parsimony. Summary of results over 10,000 randomly
sampled trees from the Bayesian analysis. Uniquely best states were
counted and are shown on the Bayesian consensus tree. Possible states
are unicellular (yellow) and multicellular (black). At the nodes,
probabilities for each character state are represented with a pie chart.
The white part in the pie charts indicates fraction of trees where the
node was absent, grey parts describe fraction of trees where both states
were equally likely. Nodes where transitions occurred were labelled with
an asterisk if they show strong support from the phylogenetic analyses.
The maximum parsimony analysis produced a similar result compared to
the maximum likelihood analysis. A unicellular ancestry for the most
recent common ancestor of all cyanobacteria is supported. Nodes 3, 4
and 5 are most frequently optimized as multicellular. Multicellularity has
been estimated for nodes 3 and 4 in 6800 trees and for node 5 in 6900
trees. In contrast, single celled states for these nodes have been
reported, for node 3 in 13 out of 10,000 trees and for node 4 and 5 in
14 out of 10,000 trees. Five reversals to unicellularity can be detected
and at least one reversal to multicellularity.
