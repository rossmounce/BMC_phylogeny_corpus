Background
The most useful model system for HIV vaccines is SIV
infection of non-human primates (typically rhesus
macaques). The pathogenic SIV strains in common use
were derived from macaques infected in captivity by
viruses originally from sooty mangabeys. In the course of
developing new viral stocks and vaccine antigens for challenge studies, we investigated the mode of evolution in
natural SIV isolates from sooty mangabeys, comparing it
to that of HIV-1 isolates from the global pandemic.

Methods
We assembled a diverse SIV set comprising sooty mangabey SIV (SIVsmm) whole-genome sequences from published and unpublished sources, including novel
sequences; all sequences were either directly isolated or
minimally passaged. Diversity-matched HIV-1 data sets
were constructed for HIV-1 M-group sequences for four
vaccine candidate genes, Gag, Pol, Env, and Nef. We constructed phylogenetic trees, and calculated substitution
rate ratios to infer selective pressure upon the two different viruses in the two different primate hosts.

amino-acid changes, but SIVsmm has a higher number of
synonymous substitutions. In constrast, non-synonymous substitutions are elevated in HIV-1 Env relative to
SIVsmm, and HIV-1 Nef has a higher rate of both synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions.

Conclusion
HIV-1 in humans is under stronger diversifying selection
in general than is SIVsmm in sooty mangabeys. This disparity is strikingly pronounced in Env, possibly due to greater
immune pressure in humans this has implications for
studying the impact of vaccine-elicited immune responses
on pathogenesis and protection, and the relevance of
macaque vaccine studies to humans.

Results
The ratios of synonymous to non-synonymous substitutions (Dn/Ds) for Gag, Pol, Env, and Nef) were 1.4 to 2.0
times higher for HIV-1 than for the SIVsmm. The greatest
disparities were observed in HIV-1 Gag and Pol. In both
these genes, SIVsmm and HIV-1 have similar numbers of
