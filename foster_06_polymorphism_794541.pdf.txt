Abstract
Background: There are at least 25 human selenoproteins, each characterized by the
incorporation of selenium into the primary sequence as the amino acid selenocysteine. Since many
selenoproteins have antioxidant properties, it is plausible that inter-individual differences in
selenoprotein expression or activity could influence risk for a range of complex diseases, such as
cancer, infectious diseases as well as deleterious responses to oxidative stressors like cigarette
smoke. To capture the common genetic variants for 6 important selenoprotein genes (GPX1, GPX2,
GPX3, GPX4, TXNRD1, and SEPP1) known to contribute to antioxidant host defenses, a resequence analysis was conducted across these genes with particular interest directed at the coding
regions, intron-exon borders and flanking untranslated regions (UTR) for each gene in an 102
individual population representative of 4 major ethnic groups found within the United States.
Results: For 5 of the genes there was no strong evidence for selection according to the
expectations of the neutral equilibrium model of evolution; however, at the GPX1 locus (3p21)
there was evidence for positive selection. Strong confirmatory evidence for recent positive
selection at the genomic region 3p21 in Asian populations is provided by data from the
International HapMap project.
Conclusion: The SNPs and fine haplotype maps described in this report will be valuable resources
for future functional studies, for population specific genetic studies designed to comprehensively
explore the role of selenoprotein genetic variants in the etiology of various human diseases, and to
define the forces responsible for a recent selective sweep in the vicinity of the GPX1 locus.

Background
Increasing data suggests that selenium deficiency is a risk
factor for certain cancers, neurodegenerative disorders
and complications from diabetes [1-4]. Selenium is
required for normal immune function and selenium deficiency can be associated with enhanced infectious disease
severity [1,5]. Selenium deficiency impairs the expression
and production of selenium containing enzymes, known
as selenoproteins, resulting in enhanced susceptibility to
oxidative stress. In addition, it is possible that functional
polymorphisms in selenoprotein genes might also influence selenoenzyme expression, stability or activity modifying disease outcomes in a manner similar to that
observed with selenium deficiency.
The 6 genes selected for re-sequencing in this project play
an important role in antioxidant defense; they include
selenoprotein P (SEPP1), thioredoxin reductase 1
(TXNRD1), and 4 selenium containing glutathione peroxidase genes, GPX1, GPX2, GPX3 and GPX4 [6-8]. The glutathione peroxidase family is the largest of the
selenoprotein gene families. Glutathione peroxidases are
named for the ability to use glutathione as a reducing substrate. GPX1 and GPX2 appear to have similar substrate
specificity, catalyzing the reduction of hydrogen peroxide
to water, but differ in their tissue distribution, with GPX1
expression being particularly abundant in erythrocytes
and GPX2 expression being restricted primarily to the gastrointestinal tract [9,10]. GPX1 knockout mice have a normal phenotype, but are highly sensitive to oxidative
stressors[11]. Some epidemiologic studies have correlated
low GPX1 activity or particular GPX1 polymorphisms
with enhanced risk of cancer, although these correlations
have not been consistently observed in all populations
[12-17]. Mice with combined disruption of GPX1 and
GPX2 develop bacteria associated ileocolitis and intestinal
cancers [9]. GPX3 (extracellular or plasma) is a circulating
plasma selenoprotein and is able to utilize thioredoxin
reductase, thioredoxin or glutaredoxin as reductants [18].
GPX4 reduces phospholipid hydroperoxides, localizes to
the mitochondria or to the nucleus and the cytosol, and
appears to be essential for survival [19,20]. GPX4 expression is particularly high in various endocrine tissues, especially the testis. Moreover, in mature spermatozoa, GPX4
functions as a structural protein that helps anchor the
helix of mitochondria in the midpiece of spermatozoa,
suggesting a possible mechanism by which selenium deficiency might impair fertility [21,22]. SEPP1 is a major
plasma selenoprotein and along with GPX3 accounts for
the majority of plasma selenium[23]. SEPP1 is a secreted
protein that likely functions as a selenium delivery molecule and perhaps as an extracellular antioxidant with glutathione peroxidase-like activity [24]. Unique among the
selenoproteins, SEPP1 has 10 in frame UGA codons, each
encoding for the selenium containing amino acid seleno-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/7/56

cysteine [25]; the other known selenoproteins generally
have only one UGA codon [26]. Cytosolic thioredoxin
reductase (TXNRD1) is one of the most abundant selenium-containing proteins and is able to catalyze the
reduction of thioredoxin in a reaction that uses electrons
from NADPH [27]. TXNRD1 is a major antioxidant redox
regulator and supports the function of p53. It's expression
may be regulated in a contrasting pattern to GPX1 in certain cancer systems and disruption of its expression may
reverse the phenotype and carcinogenicity of lung cancer
cells [28].
The primary goal of this study was to characterize genetic
variation across 6 selenoprotein genes. Specifically, resequence analysis was performed in a multiethnic population to determine common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and estimate haplotypes for use in large
genetic association studies or for future functional studies.
Sequence analysis targeted exons, regulatory regions and
the sequence motifs characteristic of selenoproteins; the
latter include an in frame UGA "stop" codon that is
recoded to allow insertion of the selenium containing
amino acid selenocysteine [26]. Both cis-acting features,
including a 3' UTR RNA stem loop known as a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS), and trans-acting factors (including tRNA-selenocysteine (TRSP), a
selenocysteine-tRNA-specific elongation factor (EEFSEC)
and SECIS binding protein 2 (SECISBP2)) are required for
efficient selenoprotein translation [29-32]. Lastly, the
selenoprotein SNPs and fine haplotype maps described in
this report will be valuable resources for future functional
studies and for population specific genetic studies
designed to comprehensively explore the role of selenoprotein genetic variants in the etiology of human diseases.

Results
Polymorphism analysis
Six selenoprotein genes (GPX1, GPX2, GPX3, GPX4,
SEPP1 and TXNRD1) were re-sequenced using the
SNP500 polymorphism discovery resource (Table 1), a
panel of 102 DNA samples obtained from lymphoblastoid cell lines from 4 ethnically diverse control groups,
Caucasian (CA, n = 31), African American (AA, n = 24),
Pacific Rim/Asian (PR, n = 24), and Hispanic (HI, n = 23).
In all, the re-sequencing project covered 58,251 base pairs
of genomic sequence, for a total of >5.9 million
sequenced base pairs. The mean number of base pairs
sequenced per gene was 9709 (range, 7007 to 13,880).
On average we sequenced 3320 bases 5' of the ATG and
3282 bases 3' of the stop codon. In each case the resequencing spanned all exonic regions and the 3' UTR
SECIS region. The re-sequencing of the SEPP1 locus was
extended to include the exons and 5' region of an antisense transcript that overlaps the 3' UTR of the SEPP1
locus. Of the 235 segregating sites, the number of SNPs

with a rare allele frequency ≥0.05 or ≥0.1 were 103 and
92, respectively. In this regard, we observed a small
number of rare variants (Additional Files 1 to 6).
The analysis of the possible sites of heterozygosity in the
coding regions revealed several interesting observations.
Of the 235 SNPs determined across the 6 genes, our analysis identified 5 non-synonymous variants, 6 synonymous variants and 224 non-coding SNPs. The coding
region SNPs identified were located in the GPX1 (P75R,
L91L, A192T, and P198L), GPX3 (L13L), GPX4 (L193L),
TXNRD1 (L55L, L80L, and C383C), and SEPP1 (K19E,
A234T) loci. Since sequence variation at the RNA level
could in theory influence translation read through efficiency at the UGA selenocysteine codon, synonymous variants might be of particular functional relevance in
selenoproteins; however, none of the identified synonymous substitutions were in the immediate vicinity of a
selenocysteine codon. No putative coding region SNPs
were identified in the antisense transcript that overlaps
the 3' UTR of SEPP1. Identified non-coding SNPs
included two SECIS region SNPs, both located within the
GPX4 locus. One of these is a previously reported high fre-

quency SNP, of possible functional significance, located
44 bp from the stop codon and just before the SECIS stem
loop (stop +35 to +128) [33]. The other is a rare variant,
identified in a single individual of African American/African heritage; this SNP (stop +103) is located in the vicinity
of the highly conserved SECIS core. SNP density varied
from 1.945 SNPs/kbp of genomic sequence in SEPP1 to
6.124 SNPs/kbp at the GPX3 locus. The mean number of
SNPs/kbp for all 6 gene loci was 4.034. Perhaps reflecting
greater functional constraint, the mean number of SNPs/
kbp was lower in coding regions at 2.161. Within the coding region, GPX1 had the most SNPs/kbp (6.568) while
GPX2 had no SNPs. Additional variation is present at the
GPX1 and SEPP1 loci in the form of a variable number
alanine repeat polymorphism within the first exon of
GPX1 and a complex variable repeat polymorphism in the
promoter of SEPP1, neither of which could be accurately
resolved from our sequence tracings [34,35].
Evolutionary analysis
We determined two measures of sequence diversity at the
6 selenoprotein loci (Table 2), the population mutation
parameter (Θ) and nucleotide diversity (π). Nucleotide

diversity and the population mutation parameter differ in
that Θ is a measure of the number of variant sites and π is
a measure of the observed heterozygosity per base pair.
More specifically, nucleotide diversity is a parameter used
to measure the degree of polymorphism within a population; it is defined as the average number of nucleotide differences per site between and two DNA sequences chosen
randomly from the sample population. The population
mutation parameter differs in that it is a measure of the
observed number of variant sites, normalized to the
number of chromosomes studied and the total sequence
length, which corrects for sample size [36]. For the 6 genes
the mean value for nucleotide diversity was 7.2 × 10-4. The
greatest amount of nucleotide diversity (11.0 × 10-4) was
observed at the GPX3 locus, while the least amount of
nucleotide diversity was observed at the TXNRD1 locus
(3.7 × 10-4). In general, the value for sequence diversity as
measured by nucleotide diversity was similar to that
measured by the population mutation parameter. For the
6 genes, the mean value for the population mutation
parameter was 7.3 × 10-4. Under the infinite-sites model
of DNA sequence evolution, if the nucleotide sequence
variation among haplotypes at a locus is neutral and the
sample population is in equilibrium with respect to drift
and mutation, then the degree of polymorphism estimated by calculating the nucleotide diversity and the population mutation parameter should be equal. This is
measured statistically using the Tajima's (DT) statistic
[37]. A strongly negative Tajima's D test is suggestive of
positive selection. In the Asian population at the GPX1
locus there was a strongly negative DT value (-1.760),
however this test did not achieve statistical significance (P
> 0.05, P < 0.10). Using an alternative neutrality test, the
DF and F statistics of Fu and Li [38], however, we do detect
possible evidence of selection at the GPX1 locus. Although
non-significant for the various subpopulations, for the
combined populations the values for DF (-2.495) and F (2.319) are significant at the P < 0.05 level. We also
observed significantly positive (P < 0.05) Tajima's D tests
at the GPX4 (2.249) and the SEPP1 (2.056) loci, in the
Hispanic and Caucasian populations, respectively.
Although a positive D tests might be indicative of balancing selection (positive heterozygote advantage), a very
plausible explanation for the positive tests in this case is
the presence of a significant degree of genetic admixture
within one or both of the control populations [39].
Confirmation of recent positive selection using data from
the HapMap Project
To confirm recent positive selection at the GPX1 locus, we
used the web application Haplotter, developed in the
Pritchard laboratory, to query a map of recent positive
selection in the human genome. The input SNP data for
this map are derived from the Phase 1 International HapMap Project [40]. Strong evidence for recent positive selec-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/7/56

tion, as evidenced by a strong iHS (integrated haplotype
score) signal, supports the hypothesis that the GPX1 locus
has undergone a recent selective sweep in the Asian Population (Figure 1) [41]. Strong signatures of positive selection were not observed at the GPX2, GPX3, GPX4,
TXNRD1 or SEPP1 loci in any of the subpopulations.
Genetic difference between sample groups
The proportion of the total genetic variance (Fst) contained in a subpopulation relative to the total genetic variance was calculated (Table 3). The data from the resequencing of the SNP500Cancer population suggest that
there is some evidence for specific differences in genotype
distribution between different ethnic groups, especially at
the GPX1 locus. At the GPX1 locus the estimation of population subdivision between the Pacific Rim/Asian and
the African American/African populations was 0.2418,
and between the Pacific Rim/Asian and the Caucasian
populations it was 0.2682. Altogether, these data suggest
that there is evidence for specific differences in genotype
distribution between the different ethnic groups, especially at the GPX1 locus.
Haplotype structure
The most probable PHASED haplotypes derived using
SNPs with minimum rare allele frequencies of ≥5% are
presented as supplementary data (Additional Files 7 to
12). Estimates for linkage disequilibrium (LD) and location of major haplotype blocks across each of the 6
selenoprotein loci are provided for the total population in
Figures 2 to 7 and for each of the individual ethnic groups
in the supplementary data files (Additional File 13). For
the data set, the haplotype diversity is restricted and the
number of unique haplotypes varied by gene locus from
16 (GPX1) to 51 (GPX3), with a mean of 28.2. In most
cases, the African American population had the greatest
number of unique haplotypes (mean 14.8), whereas the
Pacific Rim/Asian population had the fewest (mean 9.2).
The number of common haplotypes with a frequency of
≥0.05 ranged from 3 (GPX3) to 5 (GPX1, SEPP1 and
TXNRD1). Examined in a population specific manner, we
also noted variation in the frequency of these major haplotypes. At the GPX1 locus, for example, haplotype
number 1 was observed in 63% of individuals of Pacific
Rim/Asian heritage, whereas the frequency of this major
haplotype was much lower in the other populations (AA
0.17, CA 0.13 and HI 0.30). Similarly, at the TXNRD1
locus haplotype 1 had a frequency of 65% in the Pacific
Rim/Asian population, but was observed less often in the
other populations (AA 0.29, CA 0.19, and HI 0.28).
Although the functional significance of the various
imputed haplotypes remains to be determined, it is of
interest to note that key SNPs of possible functional consequences segregate with particular haplotypes. For example, the T variant of a common GPX4 SECIS region SNP

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified by re-sequencing 6 selenoprotein gene regions in a 102 member control population.
Nucleotide diversity (π) and the population mutation parameter (Θ) were calculated using the most probable PHASED haplotypes. To determine
whether variation was consistent with the expectations of the neutral equilibrium model, neutrality was tested using Tajima's (DT) and Fu and Li's

from the International HapMap project [41]. The vertical line indicates the location of the GPX1 locus. The strong iHS (integrated haplotype score) signal in the Asian (ASN) population at this locus is highly suggestive for recent positive selection. Data
is based on the analysis of unrelated individuals from 3 populations: ASN (Han Chinese and Japanese, n = 89), CEU (Northern
and Western European, n = 60), and YRI (Sub-Saharan Africans from the Yoruban population, n = 60).

(Stop +44) is found in haplotype 1 but not in any of the 8
next most common GPX4 haplotypes. Similarly, for the
GPX1 P198L variant, the proline variant (C) resides on the
4 most common GPX1 haplotypes whereas the lucine variant (T) is only observed on the backbone of several rarer
haplotypes (5, 6, 9, 10, 13, and 14); these rarer haplotypes
are relatively uncommon among individuals of Pacific
Rim/Asian heritage. In addition, there is a common nonsynonymous (A234T) variant in SEPP1, located between 2
histidine rich regions. This variant is a major distinguishing feature between the most common SEPP1 haplotype
(0.36) and the next most common haplotype (0.18).
Again it is notable that the T234 encoding haplotypes (2,
6 and 10) are rare in the Asian/Pacific Rim Populations,
with respective frequencies of only 0.04, 0.02 and 0.

Discussion
Selenium deficiency impairs the production of selenium
containing proteins and may be a risk factor for cancer,

infectious disease severity and enhanced susceptibility to
oxidant stressors. Recently, selenium has emerged as one
of the most promising cancer chemoprevention agents
and is the focus of a large clinical trial (SELECT) that has
enrolled 35,000 men to determine if selenium supplementation prevents prostate cancer[3,4,42]. It is possible
that the anticancer properties of selenium are mediated
through selenoproteins, many of which have antioxidant
properties. An alternative hypothesis, however, suggests
that the anticancer property of selenium compounds
occurs at doses beyond those that are required to ensure
maximal selenoprotein production [43,44]. If selenoproteins play a direct role in cancer chemoprevention, then it
is possible that genetic variation in selenoprotein activity
or expression might also modify susceptibility to genome
damaging environmental exposures such as cigarette
smoke or dietary carcinogens. Similarly, it is also possible
that inter-individual variation in selenoprotein expression
could modify disease outcomes by influencing major anti-

Fst was calculated by pairwise comparison of all subpopulations. A high Fst implies a considerable degree of differentiation among populations. The
negative Fst values noted in some cells should be interpreted that there is no genetic differentiation between the two population and likely reflects
the imprecision of the algorithm used by the software to estimate this value.

oxidant pathways, such as the glutathione cycle or thioredoxin metabolism. Pathways relevant not only to cancer
susceptibility, but also to chemotherapy induced toxicities
[45], and infectious disease severity (i.e., viral myocarditis, malaria, and septic shock syndrome) [46-48]. We
therefore explored the genetic variation in 6 selenoprotein
genes in order to provide the foundation for the comprehensive analysis of selenoprotein genetic variation in candidate gene association studies. In this regard we have resequenced 6 of the 25 known human selenoprotein genes
to identify common SNPs and haplotypes and to explore
the selective processes acting on these loci. The genes
selected for re-sequencing and evolutionary analysis are
among the best-studied selenoproteins and all have
important antioxidant properties; they include 4 glutathione peroxidases (GPX1-4), SEPP1 and TXNRD1 [6-8].
In total, we sequenced approximately 5.9 million base
pairs of DNA from 102 individuals, representative of 4
ethnic populations common within the United States,
Caucasian (CA, n = 31), African American (AA, n = 24),
Pacific Rim/Asian (PR, n = 24), and Hispanic (HI, n = 23).
We identified 235 SNPs, of which 103 had a rare allele frequency of greater than 0.05. For the 6 selenoprotein genes

the mean value for nucleotide diversity was 7.2 × 10-4,
which is similar to the value of 6.7 × 10-4 obtained by the
Environmental Genome Project which recently resequenced 213 genes in 90 individuals[49]. Particularly
interesting SNPs (with minimum rare allele frequency
≥0.05), of potential functional importance, include the
GPX1 P75R and P198L variants, a high frequency GPX4
SECIS region SNP, and an A234T non-synonymous variant in SEPP1. The GPX1 P198L and GPX4 SECIS SNPs
have both been previously described [16,33]. In addition,
we identified a rare GPX4 SECIS SNP adjacent to the
SECIS core. SECIS SNPs are of particular interest, as this
RNA stem loop structure is required for the translational
incorporation of the amino acid selenocysteine. In the
absence of a functional SECIS, translation will terminate
prematurely at the UGA-selenocysteine codon. At this
point, the functional significance of the identified SNPs
and haplotypes remains largely uncharacterized.
Although there is data suggesting that each GPX1-L198
allele decreases red cell glutathione peroxidase activity by
about 5%, attempts to correlate enzyme activities with
specific genotypes have provided inconsistent results, perhaps reflective of the observation that selenium status
may influence selenoprotein expression or enzymatic

activity[16,33,50]. Moreover, it is possible that haplotype
analysis may provide a better means for correlating enzymatic activity or serum selenium levels, especially if this is
done in individuals maintained on a diet containing optimal supplemental selenium.
Overall the pattern of the observed genetic variation was
consistent with the expectations of the neutral equilibrium model of evolution for 5 genes, but at the GPX1
locus we found evidence for selection. At the GPX1 locus,
the DF and F statistics of Fu and Li were strongly negative.
The presence of a significantly negative D value indicates
the presence of an excess of rare alleles inconsistent with
neutral processes in a stable population, but consistent

with either a demographic or selective processes [38]. The
fact that a similar phenomenon is not observed at the
other loci, suggests that the phenomenon is not simply
the result of a demographic process such as a recent population expansion. Additional support for selection at the
GPX1 locus is provided by the negative value for the
Tajima's test (-1.760) in the Pacific Rim/Asian population, which just missed achieving statistical significance (P
> 0.05, P < 0.10). Of further interest, we also found evidence for differences in genotype distribution between
different ethnic groups, especially at the GPX1 locus. The
relatively high Fst values of 0.2418 (Pacific Rim/Asian vs.
African American/African) and of 0.2682 (Pacific Rim/
Asian vs. Caucasian) suggest that there is substantial

genetic differentiation between these populations. Inspection of the major GPX1 haplotypes in the Pacific Rim/
Asian population reveals that the P198 containing haplotypes predominate and that the L198 variant is rarely
observed. Moreover, this is consistent with reports that
the L198 variant was not observed among individuals of
Chinese heritage [51].
Whether the relative absence of L198 haplotypes within
the Asian population is the result of a recent selective
sweep, perhaps in response to an environmental or infectious exposure, cannot be determined from our data set.
However, strong confirmation for a recent selective sweep
involving chromosome region 3p21, which includes the
GPX1 locus, is provided by analysis of SNP data from the
International HapMap project [40,41]. The strong iHS sig-

nal observed in the Asian population at this locus is one
of the highest observed on Chromosome 3 and is highly
suggestive for recent positive selection (Figure 1) [41]. A
selective sweep at the GPX1 locus may explain an earlier
observation that there is significantly less variation in red
cell glutathione peroxidase activity among individuals of
Asian heritage compared to what is observed in Occidental Populations [52]. Understanding whether functional
variants of GPX1, or other genes at the 3p21 locus, confer
protection or susceptibility in disease populations may
provide insight into the selective pressures responsible for
this recent selective sweep.
The genomic locations of several selenoprotein genes are
of particular interest. For example, there is strong LD
between the GPX1 P198L variant and variants in the

nearby gene RHOA. Since RHOA belongs to the ras oncogene family and studies both in vitro and in vivo suggest
that its overexpression may lead to cancer [53,54], it is
possible that observed associations between the L198 variant and an increased risk of cancer may in fact be due to
LD between this variant and as yet unidentified variants
within RHOA or another nearby gene [51]. Similarly, it is
of great interest that the 3p21 genomic region also
includes the gene for α-dystroglycan (DAG1), which
encodes for a peripheral membrane protein used as a cellular receptor for arenaviruses, the causative agents of fatal

hemorrhagic fevers, and also as the Schwann cell receptor
for M. leprae [55,56]. Likewise, it is also worth noting that
SEPP1 is located at chromosome position 5p13.1, close to
chromosomal regions that contain the growth hormone
receptor and alpha-methylacyl-CoAracemase, genes of
potential relevance to cancer susceptibility [57,58]. We
also note here the presence of an antisense transcript that
overlaps the 3' UTR of SEPP1. Since some antisense transcripts post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of
the overlapping transcript, we extended our resequencing
at the SEPP1 locus to include the antisense transcript.

Future studies utilizing these data will be able to explore
if this antisense transcript plays a role in the regulation of
SEPP1.

Conclusion
Genetic variation across selenoprotein genes could be of
great interest to not only association testing strategies but
also to strategies to investigate the pattern of molecular
evolution in a group of genes with a distinctive feature,
the incorporation of the amino acid selenocysteine. The 6

genes re-sequenced in this project include some of the
best characterized selenoproteins, most of which have
important antioxidant properties. It is likely that additional selenoproteins also play a role in pathways relevant
to cancer and disease susceptibility, such as endoplasmic
reticulum stress response and inflammation [59,60]. The
potential importance of selenoproteins in a wide array of
human diseases including cancer, heart disease, aging and
infections coupled with the promise of selenium as a chemoprevention agent warrants further investigation of the

role of these and other selenoproteins in human disease.
We believe that the study of selenoproteins provides a
unique model system for exploring the complex interaction between genes and environmental exposures. The
fine haplotype maps described in this report will be useful
for exploring associations between selenoprotein variants
and diseases, studying selenoprotein loss of heterozygosity in tumor samples, or for correlating selenoprotein genotypes with serum selenium levels or selenoenzyme

activity in patients enrolled on clinical trials using selenium as a chemoprevention agent[61].

Methods
Population
The control population used for re-sequencing is the
SNP500Cancer DNA panel, which represents a subset of
the available DNA Polymorphism Discovery Resource
[62]. The SNP500Cancer set consists of DNAs from 102
Page 13 of 20

lymphoblastoid cell lines from 4 ethnically diverse
groups, 31 Caucasian-Americans (CA), 24 African/African-Americans (AA), 24 Pacific Rim/Asian-Americans
(PR), and 23 Hispanic-Americans (HI). The use of these
publicly available panels, which are anonymized except
for information about ethnic group and gender, for resequencing was deemed exempt from Institutional
Review Board (IRB) approval by the Johns Hopkins University IRB. Genotype data and validated assays for genotyping select haplotype tagged SNPs identified through
this re-sequencing project and for additional unrelated
loci are publicly available as part of the cancer genome
anatomy project at the SNP500 website [63].
PCR primers and sequencing
For each selenoprotein gene the full coding sequence and
approximately 3000 bases of the 5' promoter and 3' UTR
were re-sequenced. Overlapping PCR products of approximately 500 bases were designed using Primer 3 (Additional File 14)[64]. Each forward primer was tagged with
a universal M13 forward sequence (5'-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3') and each reverse primer was tagged with a
universal M13 reverse sequence (5'-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC). The reliability of the sequencing data was ensured
by sequencing in both directions, and in the case of most
high frequency SNPs results were further confirmed by an
independent genotype methods performed through the
SNP500 genotyping project [63]. Primers were designed
to include all exons, intron/exon borders, the 5' UTR and
the 3' UTR, including SECIS elements. For some small
regions, we were unable to obtain good quality sequence,
despite multiple attempts at primer redesign and optimization. PCR and DNA sequencing reactions were amplified on MJ Research Tetrad thermalcyclers. Big Dye
Terminator chemistry sequencing reactions were run in
either 96 well or 384 well format on ABI 3700 capillary
automatic sequencers. Forward and reverse sequence tracing were aligned in Sequencher 4.2 (Gene Codes, Ann
Arbor, MI) and SNPs were determined by visual inspection. SNP data was placed in "prettybase" format and
summary statistics and Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium calculations were performed using software available
through the Innate Immunity PGA [65]. Prettybase files,
the reference sequences used to assign prettybase SNP
locations, and gaps in sequence coverage are available as
supplementary data for each gene (Additional Files 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21).
Mapping DATA
For the purpose of mapping SNPs and primer locations
we used the May 2004 assembly of the human genome
(Build 43, NCBI). Genomic sequences between the most
5' forward PCR primer and the most 3' reverse PCR primer
were obtained using the UCSC In-Silico PCR program
[66]. The location of each SNP was mapped onto the gene

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/7/56

structure relative to the following Entrez RefSeq curated
mRNA sequences (Additional Files 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27):
GPX1 (NM_000581), GPX2 (NM_002083), GPX3
(NM_002084),
GPX4
(NM_002085),
TXNRD1
(NM_003330), and SEPP1 (NM_005410). SNPs 5' of the
ATG are represented as a negative number relative to the
first base of the start codon; SNP 3' of the stop are represented as a positive number relative to the last base of the
stop codon; SNPs within an intron are represented as
intron number plus the number of bases from the first
base of the start of the intron; SNPs within an exon are
represented as either synonymous (SYN) or non-synonymous (NSYN) and the amino acid position is provided. In
the case of GPX1, the resequencing in the 5' direction
extended into the coding region of a neighboring gene, ras
homolog gene family member A (RHOA). Of note, there
is an uncharacterized phylogenetically conserved transcript (BC039102) overlapping the 3' end of SEPP1 in an
antisense orientation. Resequencing at the SEPP1 locus
was expanded to include putative exons and the promoter
region corresponding to this antisense transcript because
of the possibility that overlapping transcripts might posttranscriptionally regulate each other's expression [67,68].
TXNRD1 exhibits alternative splicing at the 5' end. Our resequencing corresponded to the exons of TXNRD1 transcript variant 1 (NM_003330) and also included the published promoter region, which is conserved between the
mouse and human[69].
Evolutionary analysis
To compare the sequence diversity between genes, the heterozygosity per nucleotide site was estimated by calculating nucleotide diversity (π) and the population mutation
parameter (Θ) [70]. To determine whether the observed
variation was consistent with the expectations of the neutral equilibrium model of evolution, neutrality was tested
using Tajima's (DT) and Fu and Li's (DF and F) statistics
[37,38]. The most probable imputed PHASED haplotypes
were used as input sequence for evolutionary analyses in
the software program DNASP [71]. PHASED haplotypes
were estimated using the Bayesian statistical method in
PHASE2.0 run either locally or off the Innate Immunity
web site [65,72]. PHASE output was transformed into the
proper DNASP input format using the perl script phasetodnasp-v2.1.pl written and kindly provided by Eduardo
Tarazona Santos (Section of Genomic Variation, Pediatric
Oncology Branch, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, MD). Genomic
regions for which sequence data was not available were
excluded from various population genetic analyses (Additional File 21). Evidence for specific differences in genotype distribution between the various ethnic groups was
explored by calculating the allele identity F-statistic (FST)
for all population pairs using GENEPOP on the Web,
developed from the Genepop DOS versions 3.3/3.4[73].
FST is the proportion of the total genetic variance con-

tained in a subpopulation (s) relative to the total genetic
variance (t). Values can range from 0 to 1. High FST
implies a considerable degree of differentiation among
populations. GENEPOP is a population genetics software
package originally designed by Michel Raymond and
Francois Rousset, at the Laboratiore de Genetique et Environment, Montpellier, France. Transformation of data
from prettybase format to GENEPOP format was facilitated by using the perl script report_prettybase.pl written
by Fares Z. Najar (revised by James D. White) at the
Advanced Center for Genome Technology, University of
Oklahoma. To confirm recent positive selection at the
GPX1 locus, we used Haplotter to query the results of a
scan for positive selection in the human genome developed using SNP data from the International HapMap
project [40,41,74]. The iHS is a new test for detecting
recent positive selection developed by the Pritchard laboratory and based on the extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH) statistic proposed by Sabeti et al [75].
Haplotype structure and patterns of Linkage
Disequilibrium (LD)
For each gene the most probable PHASED haplotype was
determined, as described above, using only those SNPs
that had a minimum rare allele frequency of ≥0.05. Using
the Chimp BLAT Search at the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Site, we aligned the human locus of interest and
the corresponding locus from the chimp genome (Nov.
2003 assembly) to infer a chimp haplotype [66]. LD (D')
between pairs of variants (minimum rare allele frequency
of ≥0.05) was computed using the software program Haploview 3.2, using the most probable PHASED haplotypes
as the input sequence. Using Haploview, haplotype
blocks were created using the algorithm of Gabriel et al,
Science 2002 [76]. 95% confidence bounds on D' were
generated and each comparison was called "strong LD",
"inconclusive" or "strong recombination". A block was
created if 95% of informative comparisons were "strong
LD". To identify a set of htSNPs for each gene, we used the
Haploview's tagger feature with the following default settings: pairwise tagging only, r2 threshold 0.8 and LOD
threshold for multi-marker tests 3.0. Of note, htSNPs are
selected on a block-by-block basis; therefore, the end set
of htSNPs is not necessarily the most parsimonious one
for the entire data set, but is more likely to capture variation in a new, larger data set that was not observed in the
initial data set. Non-synonymous SNPs and SECIS region
SNPs with a minimum rare allele frequency of ≥0.05 were
force included as tagged SNPs.

Estimates for linkage disequilibrium (LD) and location of major haplotype blocks across 6 selenoprotein loci, stratified by ethnic subpopulation. Pair wise plots (D') across 6 selenoprotein loci based on genotype
data obtained from re-sequencing DNA samples from individuals of AA
(n = 24), CA (n = 31), HI (n = 23) and PR (n = 24; n = 23 for
GPX1)heritage from the SNP500 DNA population. Re-sequenced genes
include a) GPX1, b) GPX2, c) GPX3, d) GPX4, e) SEPP1, and f)
TXNRD1. SNP identifiers are indicated on the abscissas. Numbers within
cells correspond to LD values (D'). The LD color scheme is stratified
according to the logarithm of the odds (LOD) score and D': LOD <2
(white for D'<1 and blue for D' = 1) or LOD >2 (shades of pink/red for
D'<1 and bright red for D' = 1). Haplotype blocks were created using the
algorithm of Gabriel et al, Science 2002 [76]. 95% confidence bounds on
D' were generated and each comparison was called "strong LD", "inconclusive" or "strong recombination". A block was created if 95% of informative comparisons were "strong LD". LD Plots For Ethnic Subpopulations.
Estimation of linkage disequilibrium (D') and the location of major haplotype blocks across each of the six selenoprotein loci is provided; the data
