Abstract
Background: Heavy metal resistance (HMR) in Eubacteria is regulated by a variety of systems
including transcription factors from the MerR family (COG0789). The HMR systems are
characterized by the complex signal structure (strong palindrome within a 19 or 20 bp promoter
spacer), and usually consist of transporter and regulator genes. Some HMR regulons also include
detoxification systems. The number of sequenced bacterial genomes is constantly increasing and
even though HMR resistance regulons of the COG0789 type usually consist of few genes per
genome, the computational analysis may contribute to the understanding of the cellular systems of
metal detoxification.
Results: We studied the mercury (MerR), copper (CueR and HmrR), cadmium (CadR), lead
(PbrR), and zinc (ZntR) resistance systems and demonstrated that combining protein sequence
analysis and analysis of DNA regulatory signals it was possible to distinguish metal-dependent
members of COG0789, assign specificity towards particular metals to uncharacterized loci, and find
new genes involved in the metal resistance, in particular, multicopper oxidase and copper
chaperones, candidate cytochromes from the copper regulon, new cadmium transporters and,
possibly, glutathione-S-transferases.
Conclusion: Our data indicate that the specificity of the COG0789 systems can be determined
combining phylogenetic analysis and identification of DNA regulatory sites. Taking into account
signal structure, we can adequately identify genes that are activated using the DNA bendingunbending mechanism. In the case of regulon members that do not reside in single loci, analysis of
potential regulatory sites could be crucial for the correct annotation and prediction of the
specificity.

Background
Some metals, including iron, zinc, copper, manganese,
etc. are micronutrients used in the redox processes, regulation of the osmotic pressure, and also enzyme compo-

nents. Other metals are not essential. However, even
essential metals such as zinc and copper are toxic at high
concentrations. The effects of high metal concentration
are DNA and membrane damage and loss of enzyme func-

tion. To protect themselves from toxic metals concentrations, bacteria utilize a variety of resistance mechanisms
that involve permeability barriers, intra- and extracellular
sequestration, efflux pumps, enzymatic detoxification and
reduction
[1].
Though heavy metals are naturally present in some ecosystems, their industrial use leads to serious environmental problems. The use of metal-resistance bacteria can help
to remove metal from contaminated environments.
Understanding the regulation of heavy metal resistance
could be useful for biological waste treatment and estimating the impact that industrial activity may have on
natural ecosystems. Bacterial metal resistance systems are
regulated by transcriptional factors from the MerR family
(COG0789), ArsR/SmtB family [50], two-component systems, such as CusRS, SilRS and PcoRS described in [2] and
[3,4,46] respectively. Study of mercury resistance began
with research on a clinical isolate of Staphylococcus aureus
[5]. Then the first mercury detoxification enzyme was discovered [6] and, after sequencing of the mercury resistance loci, it was proposed that merR could act as a
regulator [7-10]. The history of the problem has been
reviewed in [11-14,48]. The mechanisms of allosteric coupling of various metal-dependent regulators have been
recently reviewed by Pennella and Giedroc in [15]. The
structure of proteins from COG0789 has first been solved
for BmrR and MtaN [16,17], followed by CueR and ZntR
structures [18].
The COG0789 family consists of dual regulators that can
both repress and activate transcription of genes forming
the metal resistance systems, as though the affectivity of
repression or activation may differ between regulators.
The family includes a large number of factors that regulate
metal resistance, oxidative state (e.g. SoxR) [1,19], and
multidrug resistance systems (e.g. TipA and BmrR). Metal
resistance systems regulated by the COG0789 proteins
include mercury detoxification (MerR), resistance to zinc
(ZntR), copper (CueR and HmrR), cadmium (CadR) and
a number of other toxic metals [13,48]. Some COG0789
members have broad specificity and they have been
reported to react with more than one type of metal ions,
e.g. CueR reacts with Cu [I], Ag [I] and Au [I] [20,21],
whereas ZntR is mainly regulated by Zn [II], but also
responds to Cd [II] and Pb [II]. All known COG0789 regulators (metal-sensing regulators, as well as SoxR and
BmrR) bind to palindromic sequences located between
the -35 and -10 promoter boxes. The promoter itself has
an unusual structure, as the spacer between the promoter
boxes is 19 or 20 bp. Such promoters are normally weak
[13]. In several cases the mechanism of regulatory interaction of COG0789 family proteins with DNA and RNAP
has been studied in detail [22]. It turned out that the
mechanism of regulation is based on the capability of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/49

regulator to change the DNA structure and thus to reduce
the distance between the promoter boxes, increasing the
promoter strength. In experiments with inserting or deleting single base pairs in the promoter spacer, the system
demonstrated loss of regulation efficiency [13,48]. The
archetype protein, MerR, controls its own transcription
from the merR promoter (Pr) and the transcription of the
mer operon (Pt promoter) [23]. The Pt promoter controls
transcription of the mer genes needed for the detoxification of mercury. In Gram-negative bacteria, these two promoters are directly adjacent in the divergent orientation.
MerR binds in between so that it contacts both promoters.
Activation of transcription from the Pt promoter occurs in
the presence of mercury which binds to the MerR protein.
In the absence of mercury, transcription from Pt is
repressed. The switch between activation and repression
does not include dissociation of the protein from its binding site.
Here we applied the comparative genomic analysis to
study systems of resistance to high concentration of mercury, copper, cadmium and zinc, all regulated by members of COG0789. Our goal is to identify candidate
regulatory sites and characterize possible new regulon
members. The most obvious outcome of this analysis is
identification of orthologs of experimentally studied
genes in new genomes. Description of non-homologous
gene displacement can be considered as a nontrivial
result, and even more interesting is finding of completely
new regulon members.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis
109 out of 503 COG0789 members were selected as
metal-sensing based on the presence of at least two out of
three cysteine residues required for the cation binding
[13]. The selected regulators were re-aligned and a phylogenetic tree was constructed (Fig. 1). The branches containing known regulators CadR, ZntR, CueR, HmrR, and
MerR can be clearly identified on the tree. Several
branches contain no regulators with known specificity.
The CueR regulators cluster with HmrR and the PbrR protein (YP_145623) clusters with CadR. There are two MerR
branches containing proteins from firmicutes and from
proteobacteria. To predict the specificity of regulators that
have not been studied in experiment and do not belong to
the main branches, we analyzed potential regulatory sites.
Regulatory signals and sites
There are seven experimentally confirmed binding sites of
CueR, HmrR, CadR and ZntR (two sites per regulator
except the last one, for which one site is known) [13,24].

Despite a small number of sites in the training sets, the
derived recognition profiles turned out to be rather selec-

tive (data not shown). Further requirement of co-localization with candidate promoters allowed us to make
reliable predictions. For example, in Nitrosamonas europaea there are only three high-scoring candidate sites, and
only one site upstream of the merT gene is accompanied
by an appropriate promoter. We have observed no cases
when a candidate site and a promoter occurred upstream
of a gene with clearly irrelevant function.
Almost all analyzed loci of COG0789 metal-dependent
regulators contained candidate binding sites (Additional
file 1).
Regulators of mercury resistance
The number of identified mer operons is much larger than
that of any other HMR system. A significant fraction of
them reside in transposons.

The MerR regulatory signal of proteobacteria consists of a
promoter with a 19-bp spacer and a palindromic binding
signal with complementary half-sites of 7 bp and a 4-bp
spacer (the 7-4-7 configuration, consensus TCCGTAC(4)-GTACGGA). The promoter spacer length is a crucial
feature of a normally functioning site. The MerR signal of
firmicutes is a 9-4-9 palindrome (with consensus ACCGTGTAC-(4)-GTACAGGGT) in a 20-bp promoter spacer (See
Additional file 1, sheet2 "merRG-" and sheet 3 "merRG+",
respectively for predicted MerR binding sites; Additional
files 5 and 6 – the MerR HTH domain alignment and Cdomain alignment, respectively). A typical MerR regulon
is larger than other metal resistance regulons (see Fig. 5),
as it may include up to 9 genes. The phylogenetic tree of
COG0789 has two distinct MerR branches, containing
proteins of proteobacteria and firmicutes, and a number
of smaller branches between these two. The proteins from
the latter lie in operons with typical mercury resistance
genes. Given the importance of the correct spacer length
in MerR-regulated promoters, it is surprising that some
potential MerR-regulated loci are of a mixed type, combining a proteobacterial-type palindrome with a firmicute-type 20 bp promoter spacer. Such sites were found
upstream of CAC14713 in Pseudomonas sp. BW13,
AAM08065 in Providencia rettgeri, and AAF99442 in Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis (Fig. 2). In P. rettgeri, the mer
genes form one operon, as in firmicutes. The merT gene
has a putative MerR-binding palindrome of the 7-4-7 type
within a 20 bp promoter spacer and no reasonably scoring
19 bp promoter was found in its upstream region. In Pseudomonas sp. BW13 and P. haloplanktis, there are no highscoring candidate promoters overlapping proteobacterialtype palindromes upstream of the mer operons.
Regulators of cadmium (CadR) and lead (PbrR) resistance
CadR is the cadmium-induced regulator of the cadA transporter, and together they are responsible for cadmium

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/49

resistance and, partially, for zinc resistance [13]. Usually
cadR and cadA form a divergon (Fig. 5).
Only the transporter gene cadA has a typical promoter in
a correct position relative to the CadR-binding palindrome, whereas the regulator gene itself is either not regulated or only repressed.
The pbrR locus described in the Cupriavidus metallidurans
plasmid pMOL30 [25,43] consists of six genes encoding
the Pb [II] uptake protein PbrT, the P-type Pb [II] efflux
ATPase PbrA, the predicted integral protein PbrB, the predicted signal peptidase PbrC, and the Pb [II] binding protein PbrD. PbrR is the regulator of lead resistance in C.
metallidurans.
The CadR and PbrR regulators form one branch of the
phylogenetic tree and have similar binding signals (Fig.
4;Additional file 1, sheet 4 "pbrR" and sheet 5 "cadR"
respectively; Additional file 3 is for CadR-PbrR alignment
of HTH domains), whereas the regulon context and probably the transporter specificity are different.
Most cadmium transporters identified in this study form
divergons with their regulators. Most of them are weakly
similar to zinc transporters [26]. These cadmium transporters, along with all identified transporters for zinc, lead
and copper, belong to the P-type ATPase (P-ATPase)
superfamily (TC #3.A.3 in the Transporter Classification
Database, [51]). Almost all members of this family catalyze cation uptake and/or efflux driven by ATP hydrolysis.
Some effluxers from this family are known to have the
eight transmembrane segment topology. All identified
cadmium loci with divergently arranged transporters from
the P-ATPase superfamily and the regulators are located
on the chromosome, the only exception being C. metallidurans, where the locus is formed by the convergently
transcribed regulator and transporter (only the transporter gene has a potential site) and is located on a megaplasmid.
Interestingly, in all three cases when the regulator lies on
a plasmid (two cases on plasmid pWW0 in Pseudomonas
putida (AAN60471, CAC86841) and one on pKLH202 in
Acinetobacter lwoffii (CAD31090), its divergently arranged
transporter is not homologous to CadA, but belongs to
the Cation Diffusion Facilitator (CDF) family (TC
#2.A.4). These transporters are annotated as putative cation efflux system proteins or putative membrane transport proteins, while some of their homologs are
annotated as Co/Zn/Cd efflux system components. We
could find no primary experimental evidence about the
substrate specificity of these transporters. Based on the
positional clustering and the predicted site, we propose
that the three transporters expressed from genes

mium.
The exact mechanism of the promoter regulation by cadmium-dependent regulators was characterized in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. putida [24,27]. The majority of
the experimentally described promoters have 19 bp spacers, but Brucella melitensis contains a COG0789 regulator
(BMEI0054) which likely a binds strong CadR-type palindrome upstream of BMEI0053, although there is no colocated promoter with 19 or 20 bp spacer. The only promoter-like site that could be found around the palindrome has a classical 17 bp spacer. This could mean that
the site has been destroyed and the genes are not regulated
any more. Another possibility is that the regulatory mechanism has changed and the genes of the cad (BMEI0054)
divergon of B. melitensis are repressed or derepressed, but
never activated.
Zinc resistance regulator ZntR
ZntR-binding site is a 22 bp palindrome (with consensus
ACTCTGGAGTCGACTCCAGAGT) within a 20 bp promoter spacer.

Genes responsible for zinc resistance, zntR (regulator) and
zntA (effluxer) were found in some proteobacteria (Additional file 1, sheet 8 "zntR"). Zinc resistance systems usually reside in the chromosome.
The regulatory role of ZntR was first discovered in [28].
Later it was shown that ZntR is induced by cadmium, lead
and zinc ions [29] and the ZntA effluxer is capable of carrying all these ions [30,31]. The ZntR regulators form two
distinct branches in the COG0789 tree (Fig. 1), but their
binding signals do not differ much. In most cases the regulator gene zntR lies apart from zntA. In Photorhabdus luminescens, a potential ZntR-binding site was found upstream
of the gene PLU4679 encoding a homolog of multidrug
efflux proteins. In all cases, the zntR genes are not preceded by candidate ZntR binding sites and thus are not
subject to autoregulation.

CueR and HmrR
The COG0789 regulator responsible for copper resistance
in gamma-proteobacterial genomes (E. coli, S typhi, S.
typhimurium, Y. pestis and various Vibrio species) is called
CueR, first described in [20], whereas copper detoxification regulators in beta-proteobacteria are traditionally
called HmrR. Regulation by both CueR and HmrR
requires promoters with 19 bp spacers. The CueR binding
signal is ACCTTCCC-(5)-TGGAAGGT [13], whereas the
HmrR signal is ACCTTCCAG-(3)-CTGGAAGG [32]. The
CueR and HmrR branches are close on the phylogenetic
tree (Fig. 1) and their binding signals are almost identical
(Fig. 3; Additional file 1, sheet 6 "hmrR" and sheet 7
"cueR" respectively; Additional file 4 is for CueR-HmrR
alignment of the HTH domain). Thus it is reasonable to
consider them as orthologs.

The structure of the copper resistance systems is complicated. CueR itself sometimes lies in an operon (like in E.
coli) or a divergon (S. typhi, S. typhimurium) with regulated genes, and sometimes lies separately and has no candidate binding site (Vibrio vulnificus). HmrR is usually
the second gene of the actP-hmrR operon. The E. coli copper resistance system is encoded by the cueR (former
ybbI) locus containing four genes (Fig. 5). The YbaR protein encoded by one of the genes from this locus has a predicted ATPase domain and is homologous to various
cation transporters. The regulator CueR (YbbI) is encoded
by the last gene in the ybaS-ybaT-ybbI operon. Other
genes encode a potential glutaminase (ybaS) and an
amino acid transport system (ybaT). In E. coli, S. typhimurium and Y. pestis, the regulon contain gene cueO,
encoding a multicopper oxidase [33,44,45,49]. One more
locus containing a candidate CueR-binding site with a 19nt spacer promoter is the yacC-yacK divergon [33].
In S. typhi and S. typhimurium, the copA-cueR divergon does
not contain ybaS and ybaT orthologs. As mentioned
above, Salmonella spp. have a multicopper oxidase gene
cueO with a candidate CueR-regulatory cassette (a CueR
site and a promoter with a 19-bp spacer). There are also

several other potential regulatory cassettes in Salmonella
species that look very much like CueR binding sites (Additional file 1, cueR). One of them is located upstream of a
potential copper chaperone (COG2608) in S. typhimurium
and S. typhi. Although there are no copies of this gene in
other sequenced genomes with the CueR system, this
observation may deserve experimental investigation
because the combination of a strong palindrome and a
candidate promoter with required spacer is quite specific.
Other probable CueR/HmrR sites were found upstream of
genes encoding probable cytochrome c553 or c554 in V.
vulnificus, V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae.

Discussion

genomes (Additional file 1, sheet 3 "MerG+"). The merR
loci of Proteobacteria are found mainly on transposons
and plasmids (28 entries out of 47). In firmicutes, about
half of the loci were on the chromosomes (Additional file
1, sheet 3 "MerG+"). Other members of COG0789 have
variable localization preferences. For example, zntRdependent zinc resistance systems and the cueR system
have been found only on chromosomes (Additional file 1,
sheet 8 "zntR" and sheet 7 "cueR" respectively), whereas
hmrR, the α-proteobacterial ortholog of cueR, is also
present in the Sinorhizobium meliloti plasmids pSymA and
pSymB. While the cadR loci could be seen both on chromosomes and plasmids, a closely related system, pbrR, has
been found only on plasmids.

Diversity
COG0789-family proteins are widely distributed in proteobacteria and the mercury resistance itself has been also
described in Gram-positive species [34]. At least 47 merR
loci dependent on COG0789 regulators were found in α, β-, and γ-proteobacterial genomes, whereas the Grampositive members of this group are the merR operons in
Bacillus, Clostridium, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus

Signal structure
Altogether, GenBank contains about 500 COG0789related entries, but only a fraction of them are candidate
metal-dependent transcriptional regulators. These regulators can be selected by considering specific cysteine residues known to be for ion binding crucial based on
experimental data (see Data and Methods). The bioinfor-

matic implementation of this criterion in combination
with phylogenetic analysis and analysis of conservation of
regulatory sites seems to be sufficient for predicting metal
specificity of the studied genomic loci.
To identify new candidate sites when only several examples form the training sample is usually impossible without additional data about the regulatory system. In the
case of metal-dependent regulators from COG0789, the
specific structure of the regulatory signal which is a combination of a candidate transcription factor-binding site
and a promoter, combined with conservation of sites in
related genomes, provides for reliable recognition of candidate regulatory signal. A combination of methods
allows for non-trivial predictions like the chimerical signal structure in P. rettregeri, Pseudomonas sp. (Q9F3U8)

and A. haloplanktis (see Results, MerR), and completely
new members of the CueR regulon (Results, CueR).
New annotations
The computational analysis resulted in gradual improvement of our understanding of the heavy metal resistance
systems. The main result of this study is selection of the
metal-binding regulators from the general set of
COG0789 proteins and assigning several loci with
unknown specificity to particular metal exporting system.

The structure of a metal resistance regulon is more diverse
than a simple transporter-plus-regulator model. In addition to well described mercury and lead detoxification regulons, the copper regulon also contains more than two
genes. Beside known genes encoding cation transporters,
possible copper regulon member are glutaminase ybaS

and candidate amino acid transporter ybaT [33]. The S.
typhimurium situation is not clear because its genome contains a CueR paralog (GenBank protein ID AAL19308.1)
which has a CueR-type potential binding site, but is regulated by extensive gold concentrations (F. Sonchini, private communication). Conserved candidate CueR sites
were found also upstream of predicted cytochrome genes
in V. cholerae, V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus. A correct promoter is present upstream of the V. vulnificus and
V. parahaemolyticus gene, but not in V. cholerae, making it
likely that these genes could be only repressed or derepressed, but not activated, by CueR. The existing annotation of these genes is based on the database similarity
search. Their closest relatives characterized in experiment
are cytochrome c552 from Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus and cytochrome c544 from Paracoccus sp. [35,36].
Since there is experimental evidence that cytochrome biosynthesis genes are involved in copper resistance in Pseudomonas fluorescens [37], it is likely that the cytochrome
genes in Vibrio spp. are indeed regulated by CueR and have
a role in copper resistance, despite the fact that no candidate CueR-binding sites were found in the Ps. fluorescents
locus.
Another interesting observation is candidate CueR-binding sites upstream of glutathione-S-transferase genes. In V.
vulnificus and Ps. syringiae we have found CueR-like palin-

dromes operons upstream of operons containing the
putative gst gene (VV12767-VV12766-VV12765(GST) and
secA-argJ-PSPTO4398(GST) respectively), whereas in V.
parahaemolyticus and Ps. putida, a candidate CueR-like site
has been found upstream of the GST gene itself (VP2086
and Pp3742 respectively). There are experimental data
about participation of GST proteins in heavy metal resistance [38] and stability of glutathione-Cu (I) complexes
[39]. However, the prediction that GST genes are regulated by CueR should be considered as preliminary, especially as other genes in the operons from V. vulnificus and
Ps. syringiae do not seem to be involved in heavy metal
resistance. One more tentative prediction is the candidate
ZntR-binding site upstream of PLU4679 from Ph. luminescens, encoding a homolog of multidrug efflux transporters.
Some more specific non-trivial observations are identification of MerR-binding sites of mixed structure and
description of non-orthologous substitutions of cadmium
transporters in P. putida and A. lwoffii plasmids.
On the technical side, this study demonstrates that comparative genomic analysis is applicable even to relatively
small regulons subject to frequent horizontal transfer.

Conclusion
The HMR regulators from the MerR family (COG0789)
with conserved signal structure is wide-spread among
Eubacteria and their specificity may be predicted using
protein sequence analysis (identification of metal-binding cysteines and construction of phylogenetic trees) combined with analysis of binding sites in promoter regions
of candidate regulon members.

Methods

Authors' contributions

Software and databases
COG0789 proteins were retrieved from the SMART database (domain accession number SM00422) [52]. Multiple
sequence alignments were done using the ClustalX program [40]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the
PROML program from the PHYLIP package (implementing the maximum likelihood algorithm) [41]. The
GenomeExplorer package [42] was used to construct recognition profiles and to identify candidate regulatory sites
in genomic sequences.

AEK performed database search, study of the literature,
systematic description of the HMR loci. EAP studied the
regulatory signals. OVK did the phylogenetic and protein
sequence analyses. MSG conceived and supervised the
study. EAP, OVK and MSG wrote the manuscript.

Site search
Positional nucleotide weights in the recognition profiles
were defined by:

W(b, k) = log [N(b,k) + 0.5 ] ~ 0.25 ∑i = A, C, G, T log [N(i,k)
+ 0.5 ]
where N(b,k) denoted the count of nucleotide b at position k. The score of an L-mer candidate site was calculated
as the sum of the respective positional nucleotide weights:
Z(b1...bL) = ∑k=1...L W(bk,k)
[42]. The promoter profile was constructed using the sample from [13].
Recognition profiles
We collected all known binding sites of metal-dependent
regulators from COG0789 and constructed recognition
profiles for several groups of orthologous factors in order
to search for suitably arranged candidate regulatory sites
and promoters. Candidate regulon member genes were
initially identified by similarity search. We selected metaldependent regulators by the analysis of conserved cysteine
residues and tentatively assigned them to specificity
groups by the analysis of protein phylogenetic trees. Recognition profiles were constructed for each branch of the
tree and used to identify candidate sites. We retained only
those sites that co-occurred with candidate promoters
having the correct spacer length between the -35 and -10
boxes. Since it has been shown that the length of the
spacer is crucial for promoter activation [1], we strictly
fixed this parameter during the search for COG0789-type
promoters. Dependent on the studied system, the spacer
