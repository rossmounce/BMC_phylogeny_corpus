Abstract
Background: A recent study by Tadepally et al. describes the clustering of zinc finger (ZF) genes
in the human genome and traces their evolutionary history among several placental mammals with
complete or draft genome sequences. One of the main conclusions from the paper is that there is
a dramatic rate of gene duplication and gene loss, including the surprising result that 118 human ZF
genes are absent in chimpanzee. The authors also present evidence concerning the ancestral order
in which the ZF-associated KRAB and SCAN domains were recruited to ZF proteins.
Results: Based on our analysis of two of the largest human ZF gene clusters, we find that nearly
all of the human genes have plausible orthologs in chimpanzee. The one exception may be a result
of the incomplete sequence coverage in the draft chimpanzee genome. The discrepancy in gene
content analysis may result from the authors' dependence on the preliminary NCBI gene prediction
set for chimpanzee, which appears to either fail to predict or to mispredict many chimpanzee ZF
genes. Similar problems may affect the authors' interpretation of the more divergent dog, mouse,
and rat ZF gene complements. In addition, we present evidence that the KRAB domain was
recruited to ZF genes before the SCAN domain, rather than the reverse as the authors suggest.
This discrepancy appears to result from the fact that the SCAN domain did indeed arise before the
KRAB domain but is present only in non-ZF genes until a much later date.
Conclusion: When comparing gene content among species, especially when using draft genome
assemblies, dependence on preliminary gene prediction sets can be seriously misleading. In such
studies, genic sequences must be identified in a manner that is as independent as possible of
prediction sets. In addition, we present evidence that provides a more parsimonious explanation
for the large proportion of mammalian KRAB-ZF genes without a SCAN domain.

Background
The class of genes encoding multiple zinc finger (ZF)
domains is very large in mammals and appears to have
expanded on the primate lineage (e.g. [1]). An accurate
picture of patterns of gene duplication and divergence and
gene loss is critical for understanding evolution in this
gene superfamily. The ZF gene complement in the human
genome is fairly well established as a result of intensive
EST and mRNA sequencing in humans and detailed hand-

curation of a major part of the ZF superfamily [1]. All
other mammalian genomes currently lack both of these
advantages, and yet preliminary gene prediction sets are
widely available, for example at NCBI and Ensembl http:/
/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and http://www.ensembl.org. In
the ZF superfamily, our unpublished studies show that
these predictions frequently miss genes entirely or are
obviously incorrect. In the recent paper by Tadepally et al.
[2], we were struck by some remarkable claims about gene

content in the ZF family. Among these claims are the complete absence of 118 human ZF genes in the chimpanzee
genome (about 23% of all ZF genes) and some dog ZF
gene predictions encoding huge numbers of ZF domains.
Further investigation showed that the results in the paper
appear to be based on available ZF gene predictions, and
that these predictions are badly flawed.
Over half of the ZF genes in the human genome also contain an N-terminal KRAB or SCAN domain, or both. The
KRAB domain is tetrapod-specific [3] and is nearly always
found in ZF proteins. The SCAN domain has a broad distribution in vertebrates and is sometimes present in non-ZF
proteins [4]. Tadepally et al. [2] present evidence that addition of the SCAN domain to ZF genes occurred first, followed later by addition of the KRAB domain to a SCAN-ZF
gene. Since the large majority of mammalian KRAB-ZF
genes lack a SCAN domain, this inference requires that the
SCAN domain was secondarily lost in most genes.

Results and discussion
ZF orthologs in chimpanzee
Tadepally et al. [2] report that 118 of 510 human ZF genes
are missing in the chimpanzee genome assembly and that
many others are pseudogenes. Given the generally high
conservation between human and chimpanzee, this is an
extremely surprising result [5]. We investigated this pattern for two of the large ZF gene clusters on chromosome
19, including the gene cluster analyzed in detail in their
Figure Five. Using their nomenclature, these are cluster
19.6 (28 human genes, 9 reported as missing in chimpanzee and another five reported as pseudogenes) and cluster
19.12 (43 human genes, 14 reported as missing in chimpanzee and another 10 reported as pseudogenes). According to our analysis, nearly all of the human proteins in
these clusters contain a KRAB domain (see Methods and
Additional file 1). The KRAB containing subset of the ZF
superfamily has been carefully hand-curated in the
human genome [1]. Nearly all KZNF (KRAB-zinc finger)
genes in humans have a similar exon structure: the entire
set of ZF domains is encoded on a single long 3' exon and
the KRAB domain is split among one or more short 5'
exons [1]. Typically, 80–90% of the final protein is
encoded by the ZF exon. We took advantage of this fact to
identify putative chimpanzee genes based on a simple
tblastn method, which works independently of gene predictions. Combining results from the two gene clusters,
we identified probable chimpanzee orthologs for 69 of 70
human KZNF genes (the slight change in human gene
count results from current database predictions of 5 new
ZF genes and retirement of 6 ZF genes as probable pseudogenes, see Additional file 1). It is possible that the single missing gene is a result of incomplete sequence
coverage in the current chimpanzee genome assembly.
Our results for cluster 19.12 are summarized in Figure 1
and tabular results for both clusters are given in Addi-

tional file 1, including predicted domain content and
genome positions of the putative chimpanzee genes. Candidate orthologs for nearly all the human genes were also
found in the orangutan genome but were not analyzed in
detail (data not shown). The 69 putative chimpanzee
orthologs were identified based only on their ZF-encoding
exon. To test whether these exons are plausibly part of full
KRAB-containing ZF genes, we used tblastn to search for
ORFs that encode the most conserved part of the KRAB
domain. 64 of the 69 putative chimpanzee ZF exons had
a potential KRAB-encoding exon within 13 kb upstream
(mean 7.0 kb). Most of the chimpanzee predictions that
lacked a nearby KRAB exon correspond to human genes
that are also predicted to lack a KRAB domain (Additional
file 1). We also derived full gene models for 11 of the
chimpanzee genes from cluster 19.12, nine of which are
given as missing in chimpanzee in Tadepally et al. [2]. All
11 predictions aligned with their human counterparts
with only a few amino acid changes; one is shown in Figure 1. Finally, Ensembl chimpanzee gene predictions exist
for 14 of the genes from cluster 19.12 given as missing or
defective in Tadepally et al. [2]. Though we remain uncertain about how many of the 69 putative chimpanzee
genes from these two gene clusters will prove to be functional, our results are in much better accord with the high
degree of overall similarity of the human and chimpanzee
genomes. At the very least, sequence corresponding to no
more than one of the 70 human genes is entirely missing
in chimpanzee. We conclude that it remains possible that
there is a perfect one-to-one correspondence of ZF genes
between human and chimpanzee. To facilitate viewing
potential ZF genes in the chimpanzee genome, we conducted a whole genome profile search and compiled the
results as a BED format text file that can be loaded into the
UCSC genome browser (see Methods and Additional file
2). The positions of all genomic matches to common ZFassociated domains (KRAB, SCAN, ZF, SET, and BTB)
appear in this track regardless of prediction status. With
this track displayed in full, inspection of the chimpanzee
genome in the regions corresponding to human ZF gene
clusters reveals multiple potential ZF genes that are currently unpredicted and unannotated.
We used the same methods in a global search for putative
chimpanzee orthologs to the ZF exon from all 367 human
KZNF genes with good experimental support. Strong candidate orthologs were identified for 343 of 367 genes and
incompletely assembled orthologs were identified for
another 18 genes (see Methods). The human and chimpanzee proteins encoded by all of these ZF exons are provided in Additional file 3, including genome coordinates
and putative orthology assignments.
Zinc finger counts and other genomes
Tadepally et al. [2] also report the presence of a ZF gene in
the dog genome that encodes 70 tandem zinc fingers, far

more than in any known human gene. Further investigation indicated that a number of other dog predictions similarly included unusually large numbers of ZF domains
(data not shown). Inspection and analysis of the corresponding gene predictions in Entrez gene reports showed
that these predictions included two or more large ZFencoding exons http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/ent
rez. For example, the 70 ZF prediction (LOC484264)
spans a 200 kb genomic region that includes 9 long ZFencoding ORFs, 7 on the minus strand and 2 on the plus
strand (Additional file 4). Parts of most of the minus
strand ORFs are incorporated into the 70 ZF prediction,
joined by long introns. Genome searches with the KRAB
domain revealed that all 9 ZF-encoding ORFs in the
region have a potential KRAB-containing ORF close
upstream (mean distance 4.1 kb). Finally, two of the ZF
ORFs appear to be orthologous to two human KZNF genes
(one from each strand in the dog genome, data not
shown). We conclude that the single LOC484264 prediction spans a region that likely encodes 9 distinct KZNF
genes. Though this degree of inaccuracy in predictions is
probably an extreme, it is clear that the dog prediction set
cannot be used meaningfully to compare with other
genomes. Similar problems are likely to affect the mouse
and rat prediction sets (Additional file 5 and data not
shown).
KRAB and SCAN domains
In order to assess the evolutionary history of the KRAB
and SCAN domains with respect to the ZF gene family, we
used HMMer software [6] to search all proteins in the
Ensembl prediction sets for Takifugu rubripes, Xenopus tropicalis, Gallus gallus and Homo sapiens. Figure 2 shows the
numbers and overlaps of proteins containing these three
domains in each species. The SCAN domain is present in
each species except for chicken, consistent with previous
evidence suggesting that SCAN arose in the ancestor of
vertebrates and has been lost in chicken [4,7,8]. In the fish
and frog we analyzed, the SCAN domain is present but is
not found in proteins that also contain ZF domains. This
suggests that the fish, frog and chicken genomes contain
no SCAN-ZF genes, although we cannot rule out unpredicted genes with this structure.

The KRAB domain is present in all three tetrapod species,
X. tropicalis, G. gallus and H. sapiens, consistent with previous findings suggesting that the KRAB domain arose in the
ancestor of tetrapod vertebrates [3,9]. Among the three
species that contain KRAB domains, all three also contain
many KRAB-ZF proteins. The large majority of predicted
KRAB-containing proteins in chicken (25 of 27) and X.
tropicalis (12 of 12) are KRAB-ZF proteins that lack a SCAN
domain. We conclude that the association of the KRAB
domain with ZF proteins arose in the ancestor of tetrapod
vertebrates and therefore predates the association of the
SCAN domain with ZF and KRAB-ZF proteins, which is

For each of four species, the Venn diagram represents the number and overlap of predicted genes
encoding ZF-C2H2 (blue), KRAB (yellow), and SCAN
(red) domains. Numbers correspond to the number of
proteins in each category, e.g. chicken has 25 proteins with
both KRAB and ZF-C2H2 domains and 2 proteins with only
KRAB domains. SCAN domains are present in the prediction
sets of T. rubripes and X. tropicalis, but are not associated with
ZF-C2H2 proteins. The KRAB domain is not present in T.
rubripes, but is already associated with ZF-C2H2 proteins in
X. tropicalis. H. sapiens has broad overlaps in its sets of ZFC2H2, KRAB and SCAN proteins, a pattern typical of mammals.
observed only in mammals. This conclusion also parsimoniously explains why the large majority of human
KRAB-ZF proteins do not have a SCAN domain.

Conclusion
We show that two of the main conclusions of Tadepally et
al. [2] are questionable. First, we show that the zinc finger
gene content of chimpanzee was inadequately assessed,
resulting in dramatic overestimates of the number of gene
losses on the chimpanzee lineage following its divergence
from human. Similar difficulties may apply to assessed
gene contents of the mouse, dog, and rat genomes. Second, we show that the KRAB domain was probably added
to zinc finger genes before the SCAN domain.

Methods
Gene identification and trees
Genomic sequences were collected from the current human
and chimpanzee genome builds at UCSC (human reference
sequence NCBI Build 36.1 and chimpanzee draft assembly
Page 4 of 8

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:51

Build 2 Version 1 (panTro2), both at http://
genome.ucsc.edu/). The chimpanzee assembly is the same as
that used by Tadepally et al. [2]; we also obtained identical
results from the same chimpanzee assembly downloaded
from Ensembl http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/.
Human ZF gene predictions for clusters 19.6 and 19.12 were
derived by manual curation of predictions from NCBI RefSeq 25, ENSEMBL release 50, and the dedicated LLNL ZF
annotation web resource http://znf.llnl.gov/catalog[1]. We
accepted the gene model that appeared to be full-length and
that corresponded best to the canonical domain content and
structural features of the gene family. The ZF domains of all
genes were present on a single exon. We used the protein
sequence from the ZF-encoding exon of each human gene as
a tblastn query against the chimpanzee genome [10]. The
DNA corresponding to each best match was extracted and its
translation was validated as aligning well with its human
query. In a few cases, a run of N residues or a stop codon
interrupted the chimpanzee match; these were accepted as
possible artifacts of an immature genome assembly and the
remaining coding region was used in further analysis. The ZF
exon protein sequence from all the human cluster 19.12
genes and their corresponding chimpanzee predictions were
aligned using ClustalW (default parameters) [11]. From this
multiple alignment, a maximum-likelihood (ML) tree with
branch supports was made using phyml-alrt (JTT rate matrix,
6 rate categories, gamma-parameter 1.0) [12,13]. We note
that this approach to analyzing the evolution of these rather
diverse proteins is questionable, but we use this method to
parallel Tadepally et al. Figure Five [2]. The main difficulty is
in constructing a meaningful multiple alignment with proteins whose number of zinc fingers varies from 7 to 21. The
validity of the ML tree based on the multiple alignment was
cross-checked by making a pairwise distance clustering tree,
which gave perfect agreement in ortholog assignment. Complete or nearly complete gene models for 11 of the chimpanzee genes corresponding to cluster 19.12 were made by using
the entire human protein as query in a tblastn search, extracting the genomic DNA corresponding to the entire best match
region, and manually curating splice junctions. Some of
these predictions lack the first coding exon because it
encoded only one or a few amino acids in the human and
could not be identified with confidence.
We also used ZF exons from all 367 human KZNF genes
with good experimental support in a tblastn search of the
chimpanzee genome, extracted matching sequences, and
used a pairwise distance clustering tree to test probable
orthology. 344 of 367 ZF exons had strong candidate
orthologs (at least 70% of coding sequence found). Of the
24 missing genes, 18 had shorter matches in the assembly
or strong candidate matches (at least 200 amino acids of
gap-free alignment with at least 98% amino acid identity)
in the chimpanzee sequence trace archives ftp://
ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/TraceDB, suggesting that these

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/51

genes are present but partially assembled or unassembled
in the chimpanzee genome. For 4 of these 18 we obtained
matching reads and quality scores and made a local
assembly of the ZF exon using the CAP3 assembler with
default settings [14], confirming that the exon was present
and aligned well with the human ortholog.
Browser view of chimpanzee, dog, and mouse genomic
profile matches
The 6-frame translating and tabular output options of rpsblast (-p F and -m 8 options) were used to locate all
genome matches to common ZF-associated domains. The
rps-blast program and the KRAB-A, C2H2 zinc finger,
SCAN, BTB, and SET domain profiles were obtained from
the NCBI download sites (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
blast and ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/mmdb/cdd). E-values for the rps-blast search were very permissive to ensure
that all potential domains were found. Inspection of the
results in the UCSC browser indicated that there are very
few false positives. The rps-blast output was converted to
the UCSC BED format manually using Excel. The data in
Additional files 3, 4 and 5 can be directly uploaded to the
UCSC browser (assemblies chimpanzee panTro2, dog
canFam2, and mouse mm9 respectively) to view the positions of all profile matches (use "add custom tracks" to
load data). For example, dog position chr1:103615000103820000 displays the region of the dubious 70 ZF prediction LOC484264, and clearly shows nine putative
KRAB-ZF genes with the canonical structure of one KRABA exon close upstream of one long ZF exon.
Existing prediction sets
A different way of viewing the inadequacy of current gene
predictions came from analysis of the predicted gene content for cluster 19.12. Ten of the 29 chimpanzee NCBI
genes given in Tadepally et al. Additional file 5[2] are
annotated as pseudogenes with no protein prediction
available
(LOC468984,
LOC468985,
ZNF701,
LOC456267, LOC456268, ZNF160, LOC456426,
LOC456269, LOC456270, and ZNF468). Thus NCBI
indicates only 19 predicted functional chimpanzee genes
corresponding to human cluster 19.12, which has 43
human genes in Tadepally et al. [2]. Searches of Ensembl
predicted genes identified 30 predicted functional chimpanzee genes corresponding to cluster 19.12. Sixteen of
the Ensembl genes correspond to NCBI predictions, 14 are
found only in Ensembl predictions, and three are found
only in NCBI predictions.
ZF protein domain content
We reassessed domain content for the predicted human ZF
proteins from clusters 19.6 and 19.12. From an rps-blast
search against the Pfam KRAB domain profile (PF01352)
we found that 9 human proteins contained a KRAB domain
not reported by Tadepally et al. [2], perhaps due to

improved gene models. Since ZF profile searches identify
abnormal ZF domains that are probably defective in binding DNA (for example many are missing one or more of the
zinc coordinating residues), we used a regular expression
pattern matcher to count canonical ZF domains in human
and chimpanzee predictions, defined as those containing
the canonical pattern C X2 C X12 H X3 H. KRAB and ZF
domain content are given in Additional file 1.
KRAB and SCAN domain origin
All protein sequences predicted from NCBI human build
36 were collected from Ensembl BioMart http://
www.ensembl.org. Protein prediction sets were also collected from Gallus gallus WASHUC2, Takifugu rubripes
FUGU4, and Xenopus tropicalis JGI4.1. HMMer software
http://hmmer.janelia.org/[6] and the Pfam database
http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/[15] were used to identify protein domain content. The Pfam profile of the C2H2-ZF
domain (PF00096) was searched against each entire prediction set using HMMer version 2.3.2, and each protein
with at least one hit to the profile with a permissive evalue (less than or equal to 0.1) was marked as a ZF-C2H2
protein. These searches were repeated with the KRAB
(PF01352) and SCAN (PF02023) domain profiles. This
procedure provides inclusive lists of predicted ZF, KRAB
and SCAN proteins in each species. The highly divergent
ancestral KRAB-like domain [3] was not found in these
searches. Figure 2 represents the intersections of these lists
in each of the four species considered.

C2H2 zinc finger genes (C2H2-ZNF) constitute the largest
class of transcription factors in humans and one of the largest gene families in mammals. The goal reached in our
2008 study [2] was to provide a first view of all the C2H2zinc finger genes clustering in the human genome and of
their syntenic counterparts in four other mammals, according to available genome assemblies, and a better insight

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/51

into the evolution of this extremely large family of genes in
mammals. We suggested that differential evolution of
C2H2-ZNF genes occurred at the level of clusters, genes and
effector domains in several mammals. This was in agreement with previous smaller scale studies focusing on specific chromosomes or sub-subfamilies of C2H2-ZNF in
human, chimp and mouse [1,16-19]. This study provides
an entry point for further large scale studies with an evolutionary perspective or designed to analyze the expression of
clustering C2H2-ZNF genes in various tissues and species.
Thomas and Emerson report in their manuscript that the
number of chimpanzee genes corresponding to two of the
largest human C2H2-zinc finger (ZNF) clusters differs from
what was originally mentioned in our study analyzing 81
clusters in five mammals [2]. Considering that our study
was based on public databases where reliability keeps
increasing with time for all genomes owing to regular
updating, this possibility was foreseen as documented in
our manuscript. More specifically, the discrepancy mentioned by Thomas and Emerson appears to originate from
the fact that they used the chimpanzee draft assembly from
UCSC http://genome.ucsc.edu/ for their human-chimpanzee comparison whereas our large scale study of human
C2H2 ZNF genes and syntenic counterparts in other mammals was performed using NCBI genome assemblies and
data available from Ensembl at the time of publication
(described clearly in Tadepally et al.[2]). In term of methods, as done by the Thomas'group, our prediction of the
presence of zinc finger genes was based on TBLASTN
searches of the chimpanzee regions which are syntenic to
the human clusters (detailed in Tadepally et al[2]). Of note,
as other highly repetitive regions in genomes, large clusters
of zinc finger genes represents challenging regions of
genomes difficult to assemble. The manuscript from Thomas and Emerson illustrates this by pointing out that the
current chimpanzee draft assembly revealed clustered ZNF
genes that were missing in the NCBI chimpanzee assembly
at the time of publication of our study [2]; it thus has the
merit to indicate that atypically large chromosome 19
human and chimpanzee C2H2-ZNF clusters, such as the
two they examined, might be more similar than our study
suggested based on available genomic data [2]. Considering that several studies suggested differential expansion of
C2H2-ZNF genes in mammals [1,2,16,3-19], for better
assessment of these differences it will be informative to
determine if NCBI chimpanzee assemblies are more reliable for smaller clusters which are presumably easier to
assemble and if other mammalian genome such as the
mouse, rat and dog genome are presently more accurately
assembled than the chimpanzee genome.
By reassessment of the two large C2H2-ZNF clusters discussed by Thomas and Emerson using the current NCBI
36 Version 3 human genome assembly (October 2008)
rather than the one used at the time of our publication, we

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/51

found that several genes previously annotated as pseudogenes are now described as genes or the reverse. This pattern was also noted in the NCBI chimpanzee genome
assembly. This is in agreement with the data presented by
Thomas and Emerson in their manuscript. We had
pointed out in our study [2] that 'the percentage of C2H2ZNF genes annotated as pseudogenes was higher in chimpanzee that in human C2H2-ZNF clusters'. Clearly, there
are still changes to expect on the status of pseudogenes or
genes for members of the C2H2-ZNF family in years to
come based on the release of improved genome assemblies and detailed manual curation of individual genes for
improved gene model and gene prediction. As a step, in
that direction Thomas and Emerson re-evaluated the
NCBI gene predictions by careful inspection of individual
genes and provides evidence that in the dog genome, in
particular, inaccurate predictions lead to the identification
of a single gene in place of several through the erroneous
joining of several zinc finger motif-containing exons that
most likely belongs to tandemly organised zinc finger
genes. This is based on the assumption that the zinc finger
region of C2H2-ZNF genes should be encoded by a single
exon as observed in the majority of the well documented
cases with few exceptions [20,21], where the zinc finger
region is encoded by more than one exon.

of one or several of the two cysteine and histidine residues) is however valuable information that could be compiled in further evolutionary studies.

By analyzing the clusters described by Thomas and Emerson in their Supplemental data 1 (supp1.xls), we were
struck by the fact that the reported number of zinc finger
domains conforming to the consensus sequence were different from our results [2] and from those of the PFAM
database. The classic consensus motif for zinc finger genes
of the C2H2 type is: YECX2-4CX3FX5LX2HX3-4HTGEKP
as mentioned in Tadepally et al [2]. We noticed that the
'pattern' used for their analysis was 'CX2CX12HX3H'. In
addition to eliminate most, if not all, the degenerate zinc
finger motifs (eg. in ZNF443 which contains 4 degenerate
zinc finger motifs out of 19 zinc finger motifs), the 'pattern' they chose has furthermore the drawback of missing
all the zinc finger motifs with more than two or three
amino acids in between the cysteines or the histidines,
respectively. As an example, KLF1, a very well characterized member of the C2H2 zinc finger family with three
zinc finger domains, that conform to the C2H2 consensus
[22], is listed as 'divergent family member' in Supplemental data 1 of their manuscript and is reported to contain
one zinc finger motif instead of three; two out of three
bona fide zinc finger domains, conforming to the consensus CX4CX12HX3H, were not considered. In the study by
Tadepally et al. [2], we have chosen to include degenerate
zinc finger motifs in agreement with the PFAM database
since, to our point of view, this represented an initial
important information for comparison with other species
and thus for evolutionary studies. The identification of the
degenerate zinc finger motif (mainly based on the absence

In conclusion, our large scale study of over 700 C2H2ZNF genes in human and on their syntenic counterparts in
four other mammals provided a 2008 Polaroid picture for
insight into the evolution of this interesting family of
genes [2]. Adding to the already published literature on
the evolution of C2H2-ZNF genes [1,2,16-19], complete
curation of the various genomes, as stressed here by Thomas and Emerson, as well as sequencing of new genomes
will provide more refined and accurate pictures of this
amazingly large C2H2-ZNF gene family for better understanding of its evolution in various species and for studying the coordinated or differential regulation of the
expression of these clustering genes.

In Tadepally et al. [2], we proposed a model of interdependent evolution of C2H2-ZNF gene subfamilies due to
the deletion or degeneration of the SCAN or KRAB
domain from SCAN, SCAN-KRAB or KRAB C2H2-ZNF
subfamilies. In this model, we also suggested that singular
and sequential gain of first a SCAN domain by a ZNF gene
and then a KRAB domain by a SCAN-ZNF gene led to the
appearance of the SCAN-ZNF and SCAN-KRAB-ZNF
genes. This model was based on the sequence similarity
and exon-intron patterns of these genes and what was previously known. This model remains to be fully evaluated.
Thomas and Emerson provide evidence in favor of a
revised model suggesting that the SCAN motif arose in
ZNF gene after the KRAB domain. The model proposed by
Thomas and Emerson is an interesting and quite possible
way to look at the evolution of these genes. However, it
would be interesting to see how their model incorporate
the facts that i) SCAN C2H2-ZNF and SCAN-KRAB C2H2ZNF have a specific conserved exon-intron pattern [2] and
ii) SCAN-KRAB genes do not form a separate group in the
phylogenetic trees of the KRAB domain [1].
