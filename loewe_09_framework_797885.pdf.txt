Abstract
Background: Many difficult problems in evolutionary genomics are related to mutations that have
weak effects on fitness, as the consequences of mutations with large effects are often simple to
predict. Current systems biology has accumulated much data on mutations with large effects and
can predict the properties of knockout mutants in some systems. However experimental methods
are too insensitive to observe small effects.
Results: Here I propose a novel framework that brings together evolutionary theory and current
systems biology approaches in order to quantify small effects of mutations and their epistatic
interactions in silico. Central to this approach is the definition of fitness correlates that can be
computed in some current systems biology models employing the rigorous algorithms that are at
the core of much work in computational systems biology. The framework exploits synergies
between the realism of such models and the need to understand real systems in evolutionary
theory. This framework can address many longstanding topics in evolutionary biology by defining
various 'levels' of the adaptive landscape. Addressed topics include the distribution of mutational
effects on fitness, as well as the nature of advantageous mutations, epistasis and robustness.
Combining corresponding parameter estimates with population genetics models raises the
possibility of testing evolutionary hypotheses at a new level of realism.
Conclusion: EvoSysBio is expected to lead to a more detailed understanding of the fundamental
principles of life by combining knowledge about well-known biological systems from several
disciplines. This will benefit both evolutionary theory and current systems biology. Understanding
robustness by analysing distributions of mutational effects and epistasis is pivotal for drug design,
cancer research, responsible genetic engineering in synthetic biology and many other practical
applications.

Background
Mutations with weak effects on fitness that interact with
each other are of great interest to evolutionary genetics
and genomics, as their long-term consequences are much
harder to predict than those of mutations with large
effects. These mutations with small effects are also much
more frequent [1,2]. Systems biology has accumulated

much data on mutations with relatively large effects by
using experimental methods and theoretical tools like flux
balance analysis, which analyses the flux of metabolites in
biochemical reaction networks [3-12]. For example, flux
balance analysis in yeast allows the prediction of the
effects of gene knockouts on growth in yeast for about
90% of the genes studied [13-15,9] and this has been used

to investigate epistasis [16]. However, mutations with
small effects are not easily analysed with stoichiometric
modelling techniques like flux balance analysis, and wetlab observations are usually too insensitive for analysing
many effects of interest for questions of long-term stability. Thus kinetic modelling techniques are required. These
are frequently based on ordinary differential equations
(e.g. metabolic control theory [5,6,17-22,3]) or on stochastic simulations [5,23,24]. New techniques, hybrid
approaches and equivalences between existing techniques
are constantly being developed (e.g. combine flux balance
analysis and metabolic control theory [6]; translate
between stochastic simulations and ordinary differential
equations [25]; see also [26]). The pace of theoretical and
experimental developments raises the possibility that realistic quantitative models of many subsystems of living
organisms might become available in the future.
Here I propose to use detailed current systems biology
models to analyse distributions of mutational effects and
epistatic interactions more rigorously. Such analyses are
important for understanding robustness in biological systems and could facilitate the generation of evolutionary
hypotheses at a new level, which in turn could provide
new insights of interest to current systems biologists. At
the heart of such efforts is the construction of realistic and
reliable models of the mechanistic realities of life. This
new approach is well suited for investigating mutations
with very small effects, which are particularly difficult to
quantify by other methods. To introduce the new
approach I quickly review progress in molecular biology
and evolutionary theory separately, before suggesting how
both might be combined.
Current systems biology
Molecular biology has a strong tradition of inferring
molecular interactions from well-designed experiments
that produce clear-cut results and require little or no quantitative analyses. The success of molecular cell biology and
related disciplines has led to the accumulation of so much
knowledge that further progress increasingly depends on
detailed quantitative models [27,28]. Recognising this,
some experimentalists have started to collaborate with
theoreticians to develop such models, which has led to the
emergence of current systems biology [29-34]. These
models aim to capture the essence of important intracellular interactions of the system under investigation. An
important goal of systems biology is to discover general
principles by developing and using the tools that are
needed for analysing models of these interactions [5].
Some go further by working towards ambitious long-term
goals such as building a virtual cell [35], a virtual plant
[36] or even a virtual human [37], which could then help
with designing drugs by predicting undesirable interactions in silico ([38]. Nobody denies that these goals are far

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/27

from realisation and some doubt that science will ever get
there. However, scientists agree that many important discoveries can be made by working towards these goals, if
experimental biologists and quantitative modellers work
together [39]. Current systems biology mostly focuses on
building and improving more limited models, until predictions match observations from wet-lab experiments in
a continuous cycle of (1) experimental observations, (2)
theoretical model improvement, (3) quantitative predictions using computers and (4) suggestions for new experiments that help refine models [30,31]. In this paper,
'current systems biology' denotes 'molecular systems biology' along with 'cellular', 'tissue', 'organ' and 'developmental systems biology' in order to capture all
quantitative systems biology models that can be used to
predict the properties of individuals. This is distinct from
'ecological systems biology' that was popular a few decades ago [40,41] and that used a systems theory approach
to investigate how selection shaped the properties of populations in their natural environment.
Evolutionary theory
Evolutionary biology has a long tradition of mathematical
modelling in population genetic theory that frequently
abstracts biological details [42-56]. For example, the concept of 'fitness' [45,57-59] is a powerful and widely used
abstraction that reduces all molecular, developmental,
biochemical, cellular, neuronal, behavioural, physiological and other intra- individual biology to a single number,
which can usually be defined as the average number of
offspring that will effectively reach the next generation in
a certain environment. The concept of a 'selection coefficient' is a similarly successful abstraction, as it simply
summarises the effects of a new mutation on fitness. This
allows the classification of mutations according to their
long-term evolutionary behaviour: deleterious mutations
will be selected against and thus never get fixed in a population, effectively neutral mutations will accumulate by
random drift as if they had no effect on fitness and advantageous mutations will accumulate faster than neutral
ones due to positive selection. While this simple caricature omits the transitions between these extremes, the
mathematical theory exists to compute all relevant details.
The corresponding population genetics work is one of the
scientific successes of the 20th century [44-47,49,50,5355]. The rigorous nature of many population genetics
models and their extensive analysis has lead to key
insights in analysing genomic sequences [2,60-64]. The
current hunt for functional sequences by scanning
genomes for signatures of positive selection frequently
uses this framework as well [2,65-67]. In addition, experimental evolution approaches have contributed much to
our understanding of evolution, especially in microbes
and RNAs that allow 'experimental paleontology' for
going back in time and dissecting evolutionary events in

detail [68-84]. However, recent work also shows that the
simple molecular biological assumptions behind many of
the evolutionary analysis methods limit their applicability. For example, not all synonymous mutations are effectively neutral [64,85,86], gene order is not random [87],
back-mutations and compensatory mutations can be
important [76-78] and epistatic interactions between
mutations are frequent [88-92]. Many analyses could be
much more rigorous, if the distribution of deleterious and
advantageous mutational effects [2,93] were known along
with the distribution of epistatic effects [94]. Further
progress in analysing evolution will require increasingly
realistic models of the underlying molecular interactions.
A powerful combination
While evolutionary genetics and molecular biology have
been very successful in furthering our understanding of
the natural world, I propose that combining them even
more closely with the help of current systems biology
models will significantly improve their power to generate
testable hypotheses. The enthusiasm for quantitative
descriptions of mechanistic processes in current systems
biology could benefit from and contribute to the evolutionary biology objective to understand the forces that
shape the existing diversity of life. A functional synthesis
of experimental molecular biology and evolutionary biology has been suggested before [95,96]. I propose to add
current systems biology models to the combination.

Systems biology can provide maps from genotypes to phenotypes that are much closer to reality than the simple
models often used in evolutionary genetics. These maps
come in the form of computational models that can allow
the automated (and possibly quick) assessment of the
effects of a change in the system.
Evolutionary genetics in turn can help analyse effects that
are important in the long term, but too small for observation in any laboratory [97,98]. It might also help to identify genetic structures that are no longer optimal due to a
relaxation of purifying selection. The molecular functionality of such structures can no longer be assumed to be
optimal, as slightly deleterious mutations may have compromised functional integrity [10,99-102]. Quantitative
population genetic theories of mutational pressure and
genetic drift are powerful tools for analyzing such situations that demonstrate the limits of purely adaptationist
assumptions [56,103,104].
Much progress in biology depends on the construction of
testable null-hypotheses [105]. Bringing together the host
of molecular and other information about individual
organisms with the wealth of knowledge about evolutionary factors provides the opportunity to develop new testable evolutionary hypotheses. Such a research programme

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/27

depends on close interactions between the molecular side
and the population side of biology (Figure 1). Two recent
developments fuel hope for such collaboration.
First, simplistic approaches in both branches of biology
are reaching their limits after decades of research. Familiar
simplifying assumptions in evolutionary biology are
questioned and many researchers are getting increasingly
interested in the molecular details of their systems. At the
same time molecular biologists increasingly realise that
quantitative modelling is actually worth the effort
[29,39].
Second, dealing with the flood of *omics data requires
new hypotheses. While some seem to doubt the inherent
worth of the "new descriptive biology" that has arisen
from the massive amounts of high-throughput data, the
value of hypothesis-driven research is unquestioned – if it
is possible to find interesting questions. The proposed
synthesis of evolutionary systems biology is likely to fur-

Evolution has a great potential to unify biology
Evolution has a great potential to unify biology. The
left box includes all fields of biology that describe processes
within an individual (biochemical, molecular, cell, developmental, neuro, biology) and assumes that they can be integrated into a computable genotype – phenotype map. It also
assumes knowledge about mutation and recombination so
that probabilities of change from the current genotype to all
other possible genotypes can be computed. The right box
includes all fields of biology that describe processes at the
population level and above. This is the place of ecology and of
evolutionary processes like selection, genetic drift and migraton. The right box assumes that the fate of new mutations in
the population can be tracked so that probabilities of fixation
can be computed. Interactions between the boxes will
exist, but should be much less frequent than interactions
within the boxes. For example, the molecular recombination
machinery will be important to determine the genotypes of
offspring, but its outcome strongly depends on what types of
parents are available, which is a population level question.
The proposed separation of concerns facilitates clarity of
thought about how the modelled processes work.

ther that by opening up new lines of enquiry, inspired by
classical questions in molecular and evolutionary biology.
"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution" [106] was Dobzhansky's way of highlighting the unifying power of the modern theory of evolution. "Nothing
in evolution makes sense except in light of population genetics"
[101,99] expresses the need for rigorous mechanistic
models of evolution, a need that is felt by many evolutionary geneticists. Will it be the case in the future that
"nothing in population genetics makes sense except in the light
of systems biology"? Here is what we can learn from these
disparate fields that would contribute to the unified view
of biology (Figure 1):
Models at the molecular level can be used to compute the
probabilities of accessing particular genotypes by mutation and recombination. Current systems biology models
then might compute the key phenotypic properties of the
corresponding genotypes. Together these models could
predict how far in genotype space an offspring individual
can move from its parents and the functional consequences of a given move. They might also allow the computation of an approximate fitness function, which
determines the effect of any particular genotypic change
on fitness-related properties. The prediction of some phenotypic properties from genetic information and a current
systems biology model has recently been shown to be possible for some systems [11,13,15,107-110] and encourages more work in that direction.
Models at the population level could then be used to predict population sizes, population structures and the consequences of resulting genetic drift, migration and
selection. Selection might be linked to the phenotypic
properties computed by the molecular models by identifying their ecological meaning in terms of survival probabilities and rates of reproduction in specified
environments. These models could then compute the fate
of new mutations and as a consequence they might predict long-term evolutionary changes for a whole range of
systems between single populations and whole ecosystems.
If molecular and population models are combined at a
very high level, one can envision the formulation of
entirely new mechanistic evolutionary hypotheses. The
central role of calibrated computational systems biology
models in this approach extends the applicability of this
framework beyond that of the functional synthesis of
experimental molecular biology and evolution that was
proposed elsewhere [95,96,111-113]. Provided enough
computing power is available and the models have been
constructed carefully, one could test the evolutionary consequences of relevant molecular scenarios in silico. I pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/27

pose to utilise the momentum in current systems biology
to lay the foundations for building such high-level models. This should not be prohibitively complicated in systems, where most of the hard work will be done
independently by 'traditional' current systems biology
research. The hard work will be to produce reasonably
accurate mechanistic models of the molecular machinery
of some interesting aspect of life. To make such work fruitful for evolutionary systems biology I propose to extend
these models so that they can compute 'fitness correlates'.
It may be of interest that historical precedents exist for a
successful synthesis of knowledge from systems biology
and evolutionary approaches (see Discussion; e.g.
[111,114-116]).
Aims
This article provides a perspective on a new framework
that can help bring together evolutionary theory and current systems biology, which have much to offer to each
other. Central to this approach is the definition of fitness
correlates that can be computed in current systems biology models and that can be calibrated experimentally.
Below I first introduce a new way to look at adaptive landscapes that helps to define fitness correlates. Then I discuss how this novel approach can help investigate some
longstanding topics in biology that are related to the
adaptive landscape. These topics include among others
the distribution of mutational effects, epistatic interactions and canalisation that leads to robustness. Finally, a
list of challenging questions and some benefits of the new
approach for current systems biology are given.

The individual steps that I describe in the framework
below have been demonstrated to be achievable in different biological systems (see refs). Considerable work will
be required to demonstrate for the first time that all steps
can be used in combination to better understand the same
biological system. After that major milestone has been
achieved, all methods need to be applied to more biological systems until these analyses become routine work for
a wide range of systems in the distant future. The evidence
presented here suggests that evolutionary systems biology
at that level will eventually become possible.
Evolutionary systems biology will only be successful to
the extent that rigorous quantification of its hypotheses
can be achieved. Rigorous quantification requires mathematical and statistical frameworks for constructing specific models. It is not the purpose of this paper to define
such frameworks in detail (this would fill volumes). I
rather intend to provide a perspective that sets the scene
for the use of more detailed quantitative frameworks,
which will have to be described or reviewed elsewhere.
The wide range of disciplines that contribute to evolution-

ary systems biology makes it impossible to adequately
describe the state of the art, so I often limit myself to
exemplary references. This paper is not a detailed guide,
but rather a rough overview of methods that might be
important for evolutionary systems biology with an indication of how they could fit together into the big picture.

Results
Adaptive landscapes
An important overarching goal of evolutionary systems
biology is to understand and navigate adaptive landscapes. This skill can help solve many practical problems.
Adaptive landscapes were first introduced by Wright to
facilitate an intuitive understanding of basic properties of
the evolutionary process [117-119] and could play a pivotal role in closing the gap between microevolution and
macroevolution [120,121]. Depending on which aspect is
being emphasised, these landscapes (or surfaces) are also
called
selective
landscapes,
fitness
landscapes
[118,122,123], phenotype landscapes [124-126] or mutational landscapes [127,128,69,68]. Historically, landscapes have been defined in three ways, which differ in
their understanding of the plane: Wright's landscape of
individual genotypes [117-119], Wright's landscape of
genotype frequencies [119,118] and Simpson's Landscape
of phenotypic properties that was later formalised by
Lande [119,129-137].

Another popular model for understanding adaptive evolution is Fisher's geometric model of adaptation [45,138144]. In this model a multidimensional plane is defined
by quantitative traits and mutations are often expected to
change several traits at once in random directions, facilitating adaptive walks to the optimum. True to Fisher's
original presentation, the geometric model of adaptation
is rarely visualised as an adaptive landscape despite the
underlying conceptual similarities.
Before I break down adaptive landscapes into different
levels below, some common features of all adaptive landscapes need to be reviewed. Each adaptive landscape is
intrinsically linked to a replicating unit that experiences
selection. Fitness is measured from the perspective of that
unit, which is usually an individual, but could also be a
replicating cell (e.g. cancer) or group (e.g. beehive) [145148]. For the moment we will focus on 'non-nested' adaptive landscapes, where only one type of replicating unit is
considered (see level 3 below for exceptions).
Common features
Like in geographical landscapes, adaptive landscapes have
a plane that determines all possible places in the landscape
and a height that is associated with each point in the plane.
It is possible for objects to 'move' in the plane (e.g. by
mutation, recombination), but moving is usually some-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/27

how restricted. Local topology determines whether movements result in a change of height. Adaptive landscapes
differ from geographical landscapes in the way plane,
height and the moving of objects are defined:
• Plane = 'genotypes'. Depending on the level (see
below), the plane can be defined directly in terms of
genotypes or indirectly by phenotypic traits at the
molecular, organismal or population level, assuming
that these traits are ultimately determined by genotypes. Since organisms are complex, the plane is usually a high-dimensional space with very non-intuitive
properties and complicated restrictions on 'movements'.
• Height = 'fitness'. The height can be either a direct
population genetic measure of fitness or some lowerlevel phenotypic property of interest that might be
indirectly related to fitness. Population genetic measures of fitness ideally average over all possible scenarios, combining their weighted contributions to some
rigorously defined measure of fitness like 'reproductive value' [58] or 'inclusive fitness' [149]. Fitness definitions can be complicated by the fact that the most
important long-term measure of fitness, the ability to
contribute genetic material to the next generation,
depends on the properties of other individuals in the
population. Thus computations of height can range
from very simple to very complex, depending on the
model. Lower levels of the adaptive landscape often
allow for different ways of defining height or require a
combination of many properties to define height.
Technically this leads to many corresponding landscapes with a shared plane. It is usually desirable to
combine such different heights into a 'height-vector',
which simplifies the abstract treatment, even though it
is no longer easy to visualise.
• Objects are defined by a position in the plane that is
associated with a height. The identity of objects
depends on the level of the adaptive landscape under
consideration (see below). The plane for an object at a
higher level may consist of a whole array of objects at
a lower level. This is particularly apparent at level 7,
where each object is a whole population of individuals.
• Environmental changes clearly affect subsequent
adaptive walks on the landscape and can be seen as
part of a selective regime, which averages over all relevant environments. There are two ways of including
environmental variation in the adaptive landscape;
one adds environmental parameters as dimensions to
the plane, while the other adds them as dimensions to
the height-vector. Both appear to be conceptually

BMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:27

equivalent if all levels of the adaptive landscape are
defined consistently. The preferred approach may vary
with the model.

potential to block a particular adaptive walk. Thus
overall movements in the plane can be restricted in
unexpected ways.

For a population of objects in a constant environment to
move on this landscape, new genotypes need to be produced by mutation and recombination or be imported by
migration. In such a setting each population will be
'pushed' uphill by selection if (i) sufficient time is available, (ii) the height is correlated with the ability to contribute genetic material to the next generation, for example,
by better survival and (iii) the gradient is steep enough to
overcome the potentially opposing effects of non-selective
forces.

• Fitness as height might suggest high mountains for
large reproductive capacities. However, the effective
number of offspring produced by most individuals is
about one, since most population sizes stay approximately constant over long periods of time. Densitydependent competition and limited resources will
adjust absolute numbers of offspring accordingly. In
most situations, selection acts upon slight relative differences in a population. Defining height as 'reproductive value' [58] or 'inclusive fitness' [149] solves these
problems, but can be mathematically challenging
[59].

The adaptive landscape conveys a very powerful image of
the evolutionary process that is frequently referred to in
biology [119,134]. Unfortunately, its complexity and
non-intuitive features make it difficult to use, even if environmental changes are ignored. This has led to various
criticisms of the concept (see reviews in [119,134,150]).
The occasionally interchangeable use of the three historic
ways of defining the landscape contributed to the confusion [119]. The following features of adaptive landscapes
are particular non-intuitive:
• Plane dimensionality. Humans have difficulties visualising more than three spatial dimensions. Yet realistic adaptive landscapes can have dozens to hundreds
of dimensions if defined in terms of quantitative traits
and many millions if defined in terms of functional
DNA sequence sites. In the light of this enormous gap
of dimensionality, it rarely matters whether dimensions are collapsed into one or two dimensions for visual purposes, as such images will be misleading in
either way (see examples in Figure 2). Mathematical
representations do not suffer from this limitation, if
their level of abstraction can be justified biologically.
• Restricted movements. Due to the complicated
functional network that underpins the plane, movements by mutation or recombination to a new point
in the plane are not easily predicted in planes of phenotypic values (such as shown in Figure 2C). Such
movements are easily predicted in a plane of genotypes, but then mutation can only move in one (or a
few) out of many dimensions of the plane in any given
generation (Figure 2E). This is counter-intuitive, when
compared to the geographical 2D landscapes that
humans are used to and that usually allow steps in
arbitrary directions. A situation where no restrictions
on movements exist can be approximated by a situation where movements are restricted to one dimension per generation, if reciprocal sign epistasis [91]
does not produce 'fitness-valleys' that could have the

To make the difficulties with dimension reduction explicit
and facilitate discussions of the "Linear Fitness Correlates
Hypothesis" described below, it is helpful to distinguish
different types of landscapes.
Different types of adaptive landscapes
The following nomenclature can be applied to adaptive
landscapes at all levels. To distinguish different landscape
types, the following three properties can be used (Table 1):

• Linearity (L) and Non-Linearity (NL). In L-landscapes the height is a direct linear function of the position in the plane, making extrapolations easy. In the
much more frequent NL-landscapes, predictions of
height are difficult due to the non-linearity that may or
may not allow for extrapolations. A more restricted
plane within a NL-landscape can have L-landscape
properties.
• Dimensionality (1D, 2D, 3D, ... nD) determines
how many properties define a point in the plane. If no
dimensionality is specified, 1 dimension is assumed.
'nD' is equivalent to an unknown number of dimensions. It is not possible to model trade-offs between
different properties in 1D landscapes, as there is only
one property in the plane. All other landscapes can
potentially trade-off different dimensions to maximise
height. If the dimensionality is given by the number of
functional base pairs in the genome, then movements
on the plane are very simple as each dimension can
only adopt few points (Figure 2E). However, other
dimensions impact the height of these points in nontrivial ways.
• Constant (C) or variable (V) environments. Since
some fitness correlates depend on the environment, it
is desirable to specify, whether the environment
remains constant or varies with time. If nothing is

Figure 2
Examples of simple types of adaptive landscapes. (A)–(C) give examples for the complexity of the corresponding type
of adaptive landscape. (D) illustrates the principle that adaptive walks on high-dimensional landscapes reaching a local optimum
in some dimension may continue to even higher peaks by optimising other dimensions – if genetic correlations allow this and
the relevant parts of the landscape remain constant for long enough. In this example, the black line denotes a hypothetical
adaptive walk, which follows the steepest ascent to a first saddle point on the blue ridge, then continues to optimise by changing direction to follow that ridge until it reaches a second saddle point on the green ridge, only to change again directions
before reaching its optimum in that landscape. For such a scenario, this landscape must be independent of environmental or
other changes during the adaptive walk and new mutations must be capable of producing individuals that represent random
steps in that landscape. These random steps can be achieved by sequential steps in different dimensions, if reciprocal sign
epistasis does not prohibit this [91]. (E) illustrates how a cross section of the most fine-grained adaptive landscape might look
like. Here each dimension corresponds to one functional DNA sequence position in the genome. The number of possible steps
within each such dimension is small, even if the example given is extended to include the absence of the base and epigenetically
methylated bases. In such landscapes the simplicity of options within one dimension is countered by an extraordinary complexity of epistatic interactions between dimensions. All landscapes shown are completely arbitrary and serve only illustrative purposes. See the main text for a guide to the nomenclature of types of adaptive landscapes and the various definitions of height
('fitness' or traits that are correlated with it) and plane ('genotypes' or traits encoded by them). The latter two depend on the
level of the adaptive landscape.

specified, constant environments are assumed. Additional dimensions of the plane or height can capture
varying environmental properties by changing according to special rules that implement the environmental
changes.
Examples of simple types of landscapes are shown in Figure 2. The simplest possible landscape is denoted by 'L'
(equivalent to 'L-1D-C'). Usually the most complicated
(and realistic) landscapes belong to type 'NL-nD-V'. 'L'landscapes with high dimensional planes are a special case
as one can easily define an equivalent '1D' plane. Similarly
one could use Principal Component Analysis [151] to
reduce the dimensionality of 'nD' landscapes, if some
dimensions in them combine linearly. To quantify adaptive landscapes rigorously, all relevant dimensions must
be either included or kept at a constant value. A relevant
dimension is defined as a genotypic, phenotypic or environmental property that affects the height of the landscape. Dimensions that do not affect height can be
ignored. The general properties and types of landscapes
defined above facilitate the discussion of several levels of
concrete adaptive landscapes that can be connected to
observed data.
Adaptive landscapes at seven levels
Many discussions of adaptive landscapes prefer to focus
on the 'big picture' that defines fitness as the height without specifying the plane precisely. This is not only confusing [119,118], but also frustrates any attempt to estimate
landscapes from empirical data. To facilitate the precise
quantification of adaptive landscapes, a quantitative
genetics framework has been developed by Lande et al.
[129-137]. This framework defines the height as the mean
fitness of populations and assigns phenotypic properties
to the dimensions of the plane. It allows the measurement
of phenotypic selection in the wild [132,133,152], but
does not facilitate the incorporation of molecular functional data [136,144] and depends on phenotypic traits
following approximately a Normal distribution after an
appropriate transformation [136,137]. Building on
Lande's approach, Arnold used path analysis to decompose fitness into fitness components that are determined
by functional phenotypic traits [120,153-155]. A central
component in this approach is the so-called 'G-matrix'
that measures the additive genetic variance and covariance
of phenotypic traits encoded by many genes. The G-matrix

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/27

could be used to predict evolution if the evolutionary
dynamics of the G-matrix were known, a problem too
complex for existing analytic theory [155]. A potential
way forward could be to integrate these quantitative
genetics approaches with the various molecular and current systems biology levels of the adaptive landscape
described below. Indeed, to connect adaptive landscapes
to observable molecular functional data, recent work has
considered the adaptive landscapes of single proteins and
more complex molecular systems [91,156,157,112,95].
The ideal connection of an adaptive landscape to biological data would predict the height by ab initio calculations
from observed data and then compare predicted and
observed heights. To subdivide this extraordinarily difficult problem into smaller (but still formidable) tasks, I
define different levels of the adaptive landscape, each with
its own height and plane definitions (Table 2). To resynthesise the big picture from these levels, one needs to combine
all heights of each lower-level landscape to define a point
in the plane of the corresponding higher-level landscape.
Mathematically speaking, each level is defined as a function that computes the height for many points in the plane,
where each dimension corresponds to a parameter. Thus
for each level:
height = f (plane)
Combining two levels often requires many evaluations of
heights at the lower level to define the plane of the higher
level (subscripts denote levels):
height2 = f2 (many f1 (plane1))
Since the mathematical formalisms can handle many
dimensions in principle, no information is lost, even if it
is not possible to visualise the landscapes. When defining
such formalisms, one must ensure compatibility between
lower-level output and higher-level input. Ignoring environmental changes for the moment, I propose the following seven levels of adaptive landscapes:
1. A molecular structure in the space of genotypes
n-dim plane: genotype or DNA sequence space with n
loci.

level can have an arbitrary number of sublevels reflecting the hierarchical nature of biological systems. For example 3.1 could compute cell
properties based on molecular functions, 3.2 tissue properties based on cell properties, 3.3 organ properties and so on, as needed.
3 This level is a simple 1:1 mapping, if the LFCH can be accepted. In all other cases it may be used to provide some heuristic quantitative link
between observed and predicted fitness correlates.
4 The plane has as many dimensions as there are individuals in the population. Providing additional information on genotypes or phenotypes allows a
massive reduction of dimensions, producing the traditional views of the adaptive landscape that show the mean of a population in genotype
frequency space or phenotypic trait space.

m heights: deviation of m crucial features from the presumably optimal wild type structure or a whole collection of m measures that describe the 3D structure.
Key question: How do DNA sequence changes influence the structure of macromolecules?
Data: Crystallographic structures of wild types and
mutants (see http://www.rcsb.org/) and comparative
modelling of 3D structures in the computer [158,159]
provide easy access to the structures of many macromolecules.
Successes: General knowledge about mutational
effects on proteins [160,161] and structural predictions have been used successfully to detect deleterious
mutations [162,163].
Limits: If sequences differ by about 50% or more from
an experimentally known structure, comparative modelling in the computer becomes increasingly difficult
[159]. Ab initio modelling remains very challenging,
despite decades of research [164]. No insight into the
relative importance of mutations in different genes
can be obtained.
Outlook: A combination of experiments, ab initio
modelling and comparative modelling will lead to
even more confident prediction tools. If only approximate functional rates are required, then experimental
methods can provide a shortcut through this and the
next level (see next level).
2. A molecular function in the space of molecular structures
n-dim plane: discrete molecular structures as determined at level 1.

m heights: m different molecular functions of interest
(e.g. enzymatic rates).
Key question: How does the structure of macromolecules affect their function?
Data: Direct predictions of functions from structures
[165-167] have been developed only recently for proteins using computational methods that build on
experimental data. Generally, databases of kinetic
measurements [168,169] are growing and if functional effects of mutations are large enough, they can
be measured in experiments or observed while evolving in vitro [170-179]. It is also possible to observe protein functions in the form of aggregated rate laws that
measure the speed of a group of reactions and can be
used to narrow the range of plausible parameters for
individual reactions by computational analyses [180].
Research into structure-function relationships and
protein engineering [161] has matured to the point
where some functional properties are amendable by
engineering [113,181]. Mutation accumulation experiments can be used to assess the impact of spontaneous mutations on gene regulation [182]. Having
additional copies of genes might affect the intracellular concentration of their proteins [115,183-185] and
possibly also metabolic flux [186,187].
Successes: In principle it is now possible to extrapolate from known kinetic rates and known protein
structures to unknown kinetic rates that employ the
same functional mechanism [167].
Limits: If ab initio predictions of molecular structures
are challenging [164], they are even more so for
molecular functions. The new comparative methods
have not yet been tested in many different systems.

Outlook: Experimental methods allow shortcutting of
this and the previous level by providing a direct kinetic
measurement associated with a known sequence [168177], although very small differences can be impossible to distinguish. The combination of proteomics
techniques with the knowledge of reaction networks
promises the estimation of a credible range of individual reaction rates for many enzymes from the observation of aggregated rate laws [180]. Progress on
computational methods is impressive [165-167] and
could lead to the possibility of routinely predicting
small mutational effects on function with some confidence. Growing knowledge in protein design will lead
to more confidence in understanding adaptive landscapes at this level [91,161,181]. It is currently not
clear, whether computational or experimental
approaches will be more efficient in addressing the
very hard problem of obtaining kinetic parameters on
a massive scale.
3. A computable emergent property in the space of molecular
functions
This level is special as it could also be seen as encapsulating many more fine-grained sublevels that mirror
the hierarchical organisation of many organisms. For
example, molecular functions affect the properties of a
cell, which affect the properties of a tissue, which affect
the properties of an organ, which affect the properties
of an organism (which affect the fitness correlates in
level 4). The best choice of sublevels depends on the
structure of the multi-level systems biology models
considered (e.g. root growth [188], heart [189-191]).
If the primary adaptive landscape under investigation
depends on lower-level units of replication [148] with
their own adaptive landscapes, then these can be
accommodated as additional sublevels here. Such
'nested landscapes' help, for example, understanding
the conflicts of selection in cancer [192,146].

n-dim plane: n molecular functions of many different
molecules (from level 2).
m heights: m different emergent properties of the biological system (e.g. timing or probability of activities;
reliability or mechanical properties of structures; any
other conceivable property of an organism or one of
its biological substructures).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/27

198]. Some of their emergent properties can be determined experimentally [11,13,108,195] and can be
used to improve the models. Some biochemical networks have a special function during development
and their analysis has become increasingly mechanistic (e.g. [199-201]). The realisation of the importance
of such networks for the evolution of morphological
features has fuelled the rise of 'evo-devo', which combines evolutionary biology and developmental biology [124-126,202-211]. The quality of all
computational models at this level is important for
further analyses that build on corresponding output.
Quality here is hard to measure but will mostly reflect
the quantitative accuracy, which in many cases
requires the completeness of the mechanistic model.
Successes: It is easy to test the sensitivity of many systems biology models with regard to changes in various
molecular kinetic parameters. Comparative analyses
have shown that some universal properties might exist
[194]. Experimental confirmation of some predictions
are possible [11,13,108,195,9]. Successful modelling
has been achieved in systems as diverse as metabolic
reaction systems [9] and developmental modules
[199-201].
Limits: Computational complexity and poorly known
parameters frequently limit the accuracy of computational systems biology models [26].
Outlook: Excitement about and investments in current systems biology [212,213] provide reason for
hoping that many more high quality systems biology
models will be developed to serve as a basis for predicting the emergent properties of molecular, tissue
and organismal systems.
4. A computable fitness correlate in the space of emergent properties
n-dim plane: n different emergent properties of the
biological system (from level 3). These can also be
seen as quantitative traits.

m heights: m computable fitness correlates of the biological system as predicted for well specified environments (e.g. survival, fecundity, growth rates).

Key question: How do changes in macromolecular
function affect the emergent properties of the whole
system?

Key question: How do observable fitness correlates
depend on other emergent properties of the system?
The goal is to define computable fitness correlates that
are directly proportional to observable fitness correlates.

Data: The computing of systemic functions is the goal
of systems biology modelling, hence many such models have been constructed recently [11,13,31,108,193-

Data: A functional understanding of the system and
the mechanistic basis for observable fitness correlates
serves as the basis for defining this level of the adaptive

BMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:27

landscape. Such understanding was experimentally
confirmed in some systems [13,108,143,9] (see discussion of fitness correlates below).
Independent theory: A longstanding question in evolutionary theory has been, how fitness depends on various quantitative traits that could be viewed as
dimensions in the emerging-property-space. A rich
body of quantitative genetics theory has been developed to predict fitness effects from changes in an
underlying multi-dimensional adaptive quantitative
trait space [45,138-142,156,214,120,129-137,153155]. Despite the absence of detailed biochemical
information, such work can have experimental predictive power [143], might infer the effective number of
'molecular phenotypes' of a gene from DNA sequences
[156] and could be used to decompose fitness correlates into functional components [120,153-155].
Advances in quantitative genetics methods also allow
the estimation of selection on fitness correlates in the
wild [152] and the identification of quantitative trait
loci if their impact on phenotypic properties is large
enough [144]. Such work does not require a mechanistic understanding of the traits as would be gained
from quantifying levels (1) – (3) above. While this limits the direct applicability of quantitative genetics
approaches, one could use the experience with quantitative traits to inspire the definition of computable fitness correlates.
Successes: Computable fitness correlates can be
defined in metabolic networks with the help of flux
balance analysis models [9] and in circadian clocks
using other approaches [196]. The former are supported by experiments [13,16,108,9]. Observations
also confirm predictions from abstract general models
that map quantitative traits to fitness [143].
Limits: To provide a good mapping of the adaptive
landscape at this level, one either needs a thorough
mechanistic understanding of the corresponding fitness correlates or a firm grasp of a general theory that
allows for reasonable predictions in the presence of
many poorly known interactions. Neither may be easy
to obtain for some systems. Testing the accuracy of a
given mapping with the help of the Linear Fitness Correlate Hypothesis (see below) can inspire research
towards obtaining better mappings.
Outlook: The most difficult groundwork for this step
is the availability of good computational systems biology models. Defining computational fitness correlates
for these models is usually only a minor addition that
is based on biological intuition. Once such work has
been pioneered for particular types of systems, pat-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/27

terns are likely to emerge. The computational nature
of these models makes it easy to analyse very small
effects and thus provides an empirical foundation for
theoretical analyses that otherwise have to make many
non testable assumptions. It will be interesting to see
how much of the independently developed quantitative genetics theory that maps quantitative traits to fitness will be confirmed by mechanistically explicit
adaptive landscapes of this level.
5. An observable fitness correlate in the space of computable fitness
correlates
The purpose of this level is to test the Linear Fitness
Correlate Hypothesis (LFCH) and to make heuristic
quantitative adjustments, if computed and observed
fitness correlate differences do not match.

n-dim plane: n different computable fitness correlates
(from level 4).
m heights: m observable fitness correlates of the biological system (e.g. survival, fecundity, growth rates).
These have to be observed experimentally to calibrate
the computational fitness correlates. Ideally, m = n.
Key question: Does the computational model reflect
biological reality? If yes, both fitness correlates should
be proportional to each other, resulting in a landscape
of type 'L-1D' (see Figure 2A + 3). Experiments with
many well-characterised mutants will be required to
detect deviations from a 'L-1D' landscape.
Data: Computational fitness correlates data depends
on the successful completion of level 4. Observable fitness correlates data can be readily generated by wellestablished experimental protocols for measuring
properties such as survival, fecundity, or growth rates.
The challenge is to find mutants that differ enough
from the wild type to result in significant observable
differences and that are characterised well enough at
the molecular level to allow the prediction of computational fitness correlates.
Successes: Computational fitness correlates that
match experimental observations include the effects of
lethal gene knockouts on growth rates in yeast that can
be predicted from flux balance analysis in over 90% of
all cases [11,13,14,9]. It was also possible to predict
epistatic effects [16,143] and adaptive evolution [108]
in microbes. Two out of four tested genotypes of a bacteriophage were in moderate agreement with computational predictions of growth rates [109].
Limits: The large efforts required for adding a new
point to the calibration in Figure 3 can prohibit the

The Linear Fitness Correlate Hypothesis
The Linear Fitness Correlate Hypothesis. This hypothesis states that it is possible to define a computable fitness correlate (fcc) based on a comprehensive systems biology model
that is proportional to a particular observable fitness correlate (fco) like survival, fecundity or growth rate. The resulting
adaptive landscape is of type 'L-1D' (see Figure 2). Mutants
(yellow squares) with values below the wildtype value can be
constructed by introducing deleterious mutations of known
effects. Mutants with values above the wildtype can be difficult
to obtain in natural environments for fitness correlates that
closely follow fitness (the wild type is optimised for these).
Artificial environments can solve this problem, as wild types
are less adapted here, leaving more room for optimisation.
Once calibrated by such mutants, in silico estimates can capture very small effects more precisely than direct observations with their accompanying experimental errors. See text
for more explanations.
screening of enough mutants for reliable calibration in
many systems. The approach presented here is new, so
experience is sparse. See more details below.
Outlook: Comparing observed and computationally
predicted fitness correlates is a key aim of evolutionary
systems biology. The increasing numbers of quantitative systems biology models with experimental support that are under development will provide
increasing opportunities for comparing observed and
computed fitness correlates. Computing a specific fitness correlate in a specific system through all levels
described above and obtaining a reasonable match
with experiments can be seen as evolutionary systems
biology's equivalent of sequencing a genome: it was
thought to be impossible for a long time, was eventually reduced to a technical challenge and is now done
routinely in many labs.

Data, Successes, Limits, Outlook: Life-history evolution models have been used for a long time to address
core questions of the adaptive landscape at this level,
so a rich set of existing theory can be used
[132,152,215-217]. This also includes the contributions of the formal Darwinism project [59] that rigorously defines 'reproductive value' as the maximand of
evolution [58] (or 'inclusive fitness', if social evolution
is considered [149]). If the plane of fitness correlates is
substituted by the underlying plane of genotypes, then
this level becomes equivalent to the first definition of
an adaptive landscape given by Wright [117-119]. The
prospect of rigorously computing all levels up to this
one in real biological systems is exciting for everybody
with an interest in the integration of biological knowledge.
7. The mean fitness of a population in the space of the fitness values
of all individuals in the population
n-dim plane: fitness values (level 6) of n individuals in
the population. To allow for meaningful analyses,
some additional information about each individual is
usually given too (e.g. genotype or phenotype). This
technically multiplies the dimensions of the plane by
the number of state dimensions given for each individual. However this also allows for a massive reduction of dimensionality, if only the mean value of the
population is of interest for each state dimension.

height: average fitness of the population (dimensionality as in height of level 6).
Key question: What is the population doing as a
whole? Are there cases of balancing or frequencydependent selection?
Data, Successes, Limits, Outlook: This level provides
the link to traditional adaptive landscape representations showing the mean of a population in the space
of allele frequencies or in the space of phenotypic
traits. The former goes back to Wright [119,118] and
the latter to Simpson and Lande [129,134]. While evolution will maximise the mean fitness of a population

Page 12 of 34

BMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:27

under standard assumptions, some conditions like
non-random mating or frequency-dependent selection may not increase mean fitness, which has led to
criticism of this representation of the adaptive landscape (for a review, see [134]). However in many cases
quantitative analyses of the population mean are an
excellent tool for investigating the adaptive landscape
at a high level [118,134,135]. It would be a powerful
demonstration of the unifying potential of evolutionary theory, if the classic quantitative genetics analyses
of adaptive landscapes could one day be combined
with current systems biology models for analysing
mutational effects that have so far been too small for
direct observations.
In principle each of these levels can belong to all types of
landscapes described before, although non-linear landscapes will strongly dominate some levels. Some landscapes will assume a constant environment, which cannot
be considered realistic in all cases. Other landscapes are
dynamic in that they change with environmental conditions [134,135,218]. To account for changes in the environment, one can either extend the corresponding planes
or height-vectors by additional dimensions (see above).
Since adaptive landscapes are very difficult to visualise,
biologists have developed simplifications that focus on
particular aspects. Below I will show how two such simplifications can be investigated with the help of fitness correlates. Distributions of mutational effects can be derived from
adaptive landscapes by choosing a particular reference
point and then constructing a histogram of all fitness differences that can be reached from the reference point in a
single mutational step. Distributions of epistatic effects can
be obtained by exploring how much the effects of combinations of multiple mutational steps will deviate from the
expectation that all effects are independent. Thus fitness
correlates allow the biologically informed investigation of
many longstanding questions in evolutionary biology,
including the fraction of advantageous and compensatory
mutations.
Fitness correlates
The careful reader will have noticed that adaptive landscapes at level 5 above are redundant under the ideal conditions of perfect knowledge, where computed and
observed fitness correlates are identical. Since we are far
from perfect knowledge in many systems, this level is
deliberately left in the hierarchy in order to:

• Allow for testing how close one is to perfect knowledge of the system, where the Linear Fitness Correlate
Hypothesis becomes true (see below).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/27

• Allow for empirical corrections at level 5, based on
interpolations from experiments with well-characterised mutants in cases where knowledge is less than
perfect.
The Linear Fitness Correlate Hypothesis (LFCH)
The LFCH assumes that it is possible to understand biological systems mechanistically and states that a biological
system has been understood, once it is possible to define computable fitness correlates that are proportional to observable fitness correlates in corresponding mutants. In other words, the
adaptive landscape at level 5 must be of type 'L-1D' (Figure 2A + 3) for each fitness correlate that is studied. In
order to test the LFCH, one has to construct as many
mutants as possible with the following properties:

1. Mutants must be well enough characterised to allow
prediction of their computable fitness correlates.
2. It must be possible to measure the corresponding
observable fitness correlate in the mutants.
3. The observable fitness correlate of the mutant must
show statistically significant differences from the reference wild type.
4. Some mutants' fitness correlates should be lower
than those of the wild type, while others should be
higher to guarantee that values on both sides of the
wild type are on the same line (see Figure 3).
Fitness decreasing mutants
The construction of mutants with fitness correlate values
below the wild type might be achieved by (i) knockingout genes, (ii) adjusting their regulation or (iii) targeted
protein design. Decreasing fitness is expected to be relatively easy, since the wild type is probably close to its evolutionary optimum. The fitness effects of knock-out
mutants have been measured on a large scale in yeast [1315,219,9]. Work that links particular genotypes to particular fitness values is also possible for more complex
organisms (e.g. ([220]).
Fitness increasing mutants
To obtain fitness values above the wild type is more challenging, because organisms are usually well adapted to
their environment. Nevertheless, examples show that this
is possible. A large-scale screen that introduced new network connections in the regulatory network of E. coli
found some of the changes to be advantageous for fitness
in a laboratory environment [221]. Another screen that
deleted genes from Bacillus subtilis found that some deletions actually increased metabolic flux and hence growth
rate under some conditions, albeit these deleted genes
were important under other conditions [222]. Thus one

Page 13 of 34

BMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:27

might frequently have to rely on artificial environments to
identify mutations that exceed wild type fitness correlates,
since wild types were not selected in these environments
and thus cannot be expected to be optimal. As trade-offs
are frequent in life history evolution there might be many
opportunities for quantifying mutants that exceed wild
type fitness correlates. Since ultimate fitness is predicted at
a higher level of the adaptive landscape than fitness correlates, it should be possible to test the LFCH on both sides
of a wild type value even though wild types are usually
optimally adapted to the wild. For a given set of changes
in the environment it was possible to predict in silico the
observable adaptive evolution of E. coli [108]. Other
experiments observed adaptation to a new environment
on the long-term [71-75,223,224]. Some systems might
allow the use of biotechnological approaches to increase
fitness correlates [225]. Finally, one might consider computational searches to speed up the process (investigating
the systems biology model used for this work could provide hints for promising candidates for mutagenesis).
When to accept the LFCH?
To thoroughly test the LFCH requires the construction of
many appropriate mutants. Technically, the LFCH will
never be proven correct for any system, since one cannot
categorically exclude that some future mutant will contradict a current L-1D landscape. However, as soon as 3 or
more significantly different genotypes line up as expected
in this landscape, some empirical support for the LFCH
can be said to exist. Obviously many more mutants will be
required to increase trust in the understanding of any particular system. A quick (and risky) way of building trust in
the current understanding is the experimental confirmation of 'daring' predictions of unexpected and previously
unknown properties of the system. Currently, a substantial level of trust exists for flux balance analysis models of
E. coli [108,7]; a small-scale comparison of 6 predicted
and observed non-lethal E. coli knock-out growth rates
showed a high correlation of around 0.8[12]. In yeast FBA
models predict lethal knock-out effects with an accuracy
of over 90% [13-15,219,9], where the biomass production flux is the computed fitness correlate and growth rate
is the observed fitness correlate. However, there is currently no strong correlation between the predicted and
observed growth rate of non-lethal knock-outs known in
yeast (FBA usually predicts either very small effects like <
0.1% or approximate lethality; few predictions are on the
order of 1%–50% where growth rates would be easy to
measure; B. Papp, personal communication). This may be
due to limitations of FBA [10] or due to the choice of the
underlying optimisation procedures [7,8]. It demonstrates further scope for improvement of the FBA
approach.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/27

Why not predict fitness correlates directly?
The direct ab initio prediction of the absolute values of
observable fitness correlates requires a sufficiently comprehensive model of the organism, as many systems influence fitness correlates such as survival or fecundity. In
other words, every significant sub-system of an organism
that affects the traits of interest has to be included, lest the
absolute magnitude will be wrong. Not so under the
LFCH. Here it is only necessary that the prediction is linear to the observations, as slope and axis intercept can be
easily estimated from the observations. This implies that
one only needs to compute all the interactions within a
given subsystem, while all other independent subsystems
can be ignored. Functional knowledge and biological
intuition can thus be used to 'divide and conquer' complexity, harnessing the power of evolutionary systems
biology for much smaller systems.
Limited LFCH support and failure of the LFCH
Many biologists are used to extraordinary noise in
observed datasets and the complexity of the analyses
required for testing the LFCH suggest that initial results
will be very noisy as well. The LFCH can be rejected, if
there is enough statistical evidence to reject a linear correlation. This has to be distinguished from situations where
there is only limited support for the LFCH. This is the case,
when (i) non-linear parts of the plane are consciously
excluded or (ii) it is not known how to exclude non-linear
outliers throughout the plane. A few percent of current flux
balance analysis predictions are wrong [9,13-15]. Does
that justify rejection of the LFCH? As long as all relevant
results are reported, it will probably remain a matter of
personal taste as to what cut-off levels will be used to
"accept" or "reject" the LFCH – similar to current use of Pvalues in hypothesis testing. Any limitation of support for
the LFCH obviously indicates that there is further room
for improving the model.
Calibration
Technically, one can use an assumed linear relationship
for the initial calibration of computed fitness correlates if
only two observed fitness correlate values are available
(example: wild type reference and one knock-out mutation). If the relationship is indeed linear, adding more
mutations will merely confirm this and increase precision.
If the correlation is decidedly non-linear and the LFCH is
falsified, the additional data can be put to more use than
merely rejecting the current evolutionary systems biology
model. Such data can be used to calibrate a map from the
current computed fitness correlates to the observed fitness
correlates. In situations like these, the adaptive landscapes
of level 5 are needed as a separate level (observed fitness
correlates in the space of predicted fitness correlates; see
above).

The power of linear extrapolations
Linear extrapolations are often particularly accurate, if the
extrapolations are small. This is the mathematical basis
behind much of calculus, as arbitrary functions can be
composed of many small lines, where shorter lines lead to
more precision. Applying this logic to the LFCH has several implications.

First, if a linear correlation can be demonstrated on both
sides of a reference wild type point, then one can have a
high confidence in computational results within that
range, which implies that very small mutational effects
can be predicted with a high accuracy. This is important,
since these mutational effects have been very difficult (or
impossible) to analyse with other methods so far.
Second, if the LFCH is rejected, one could still use the
existing data points for interpolations that allow for arbitrary mappings with reasonable accuracy. Whatever interpolation or surface averaging function is used, smaller
deviations than observed fitness correlate differences are
again very likely to be relatively accurate.
Third, in the absence of any experimental calibration,
continuous fitness correlates are still expected to behave
approximately linearly in the immediate proximity of the
wild type reference point that the model aims to represent. The selection coefficient of a mutation is defined relative to that of other alleles, so the absolute magnitude of
fitness correlates is not needed for many evolutionary
analyses. An unknown LFCH slope will result in the need
to scale inferred selection coefficients by an unknown, but
constant factor if one can assume that the LFCH holds.
This allows biologically interesting statements about very
small mutational effects as discussed below. To obtain
precise selection coefficients, one only needs to scale
results with a corrected slope. Without such a correction,
one can still estimate the shape of the distribution of
mutational effects, the fraction of advantageous versus
deleterious changes, the frequency of compensatory
changes and many observations about epistasis. Thus,
many interesting questions can be addressed by assuming
the LFCH in the absence of any calibration.
How to define computable fitness correlates
To define computable fitness correlates requires much
biological intuition and can be considered an abstract
form of art, like all modelling. However, a few guiding
principles can greatly facilitate the process.
Focus on one fitness correlate at a time
The first important step towards their successful definition is to realise that computing fitness correlates is different from computing fitness. To calculate fitness, one
needs to use a model of life history evolution that takes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/27

various fitness correlates as input [58,59,149,215-217].
Such a model may be complex or simple but it will always
have clearly defined fitness correlates as input. Fitness correlates can be survival rates, reproductive output, growth
rates, resource allocation strategies and/or many other
properties that are frequently investigated in life history
evolution. Thus, to successfully define a computable fitness correlate requires focussing on this particular fitness
correlate and finding all lower-level processes, structures
and functions that contribute to it (see below). While this
is done for one particular fitness correlate all other fitness
correlates can be ignored. After every single fitness correlate has been defined bottum up, they are combined in an
overarching life-history evolution model that specifies fitness and potential trade-offs at the highest level.
Develop biological intuition
The next important step is to develop a good biological
intuition for the system in question. This is less well
defined than the first step, as it heavily depends on the
specifics of that system. Many important hints can be
obtained by talking to different experts that understand
particular aspects of that system very well. Learning about
the ecological functions of the system could be as instructive as the analysis of potentially interesting observations
of phenotypic selection in the wild [152]. It is important
to mentally put oneself in the system's place to develop an
intuition for how it works. It might also help to imagine
that one would have to engineer such a system in order to
maximise the fitness correlate: Which properties would or
would not be important? How are they related? How do
they combine functionally to determine ultimate behaviour? Are there indirect effects that could be important?
Current systems biology uses top-down and bottom-up
approaches to arrive at complete and quantitative descriptions of particular systems of interest [5]. This requires the
development of substantial amounts of intuition that is
likely to be very helpful in the development of computable fitness correlates.
Use recurrent guiding questions
Recurrent patterns can be expected to emerge when
repeatedly engaging in the definition of computable fitness correlates. Such patterns can be used to define guiding questions that might help to develop computable
fitness correlates. Top-down and bottom-up approaches
can be used to investigate all processes that might affect
the answer to a particular question [5]. Such questions
might include the following:

• How does this system impact the energy balance?
Does a mutation lead to the consumption of more or
less energy? Will a mutation help the acquisition of
metabolic energy or food from the environment?

• How does this system impact the probability of survival? Is it important for fighting pathogens? Is survival endangered by a particular mutation that impairs
the system? What happens to survival in various environments if the whole system fails? How frequently is
this system critical for survival?
• How does this system impact mating success? Sexual
selection can be a strong evolutionary force and various traits can acquire special importance by serving as
signals during the selection of mates.
• Will this system make it easier to produce more offspring quicker?
• Does this system impact the reliability of other systems? The rate of errors during transcription and translation will affect the quality of proteins in a cell and
the rate of DNA replication errors can change the
probability of acquiring cancer.
There are many more questions that can be asked at a
much more detailed level. It will be helpful to collect such
questions and evaluate their usefulness to facilitate efforts
to define fitness correlates.
Handle trade-offs
Many systems require more than one fitness correlate to
accurately reflect their evolution. For example, all organisms rely on metabolic energy for survival, but if they
accumulate too much of it, their probability of survival
can be reduced by predators or obesity related problems.
Such situations lead to trade-offs, where the evolutionary
fitness optimum consists of a compromise between two
important features that cannot both be optimal. There are
two basic ways of handling such situations:

• Limit the scope of the adaptive landscape. The
existence of trade-offs indicates that often there is a
range of parameter space, where one or the other factor dominates. In the absence of an appropriate life
history evolution model, one could limit the investigation to parameter combinations that do not require
knowledge of the trade-off. In that case the side effects
of changes in one fitness correlate on other fitness correlates can be ignored.
• Build an appropriate life history model. If such a
model includes all fitness correlates that are affected
by particular changes of the system, then much more
general predictions of evolutionary optima become
possible (see discussion of levels 6 + 7 above, which
map fitness correlates to the fitness of an individual to
the mean fitness of a population).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/27

Ideally one will want to find the properties in a mechanistically understood molecular or tissue-level subsystem
that limit the value of an observable fitness correlate.
Using mechanistic insight, one will then define a set of
equations and algorithms allowing the computation of a
value that is expected to be linearly correlated with the
observable fitness correlate. The goal is reached when
computations and observations match as stated by the
LFCH.
Examples of potential computable fitness correlates
Few computable fitness correlates have been defined so
far, as the level of knowledge required for attempting such
definitions has only become available recently. A well
known example of a fitness correlate is the prediction of
growth rates of microbes from total metabolic flux or total
biomass production in flux balance analysis models of E.
coli [108,12] and yeast [9,13-15,219]. The LFCH is supported in these systems, albeit with some limitations.

From work that combines experimental molecular biology and evolution come examples of molecular properties
that affect energy metabolism and that map directly to relative growth rates as observed in a chemostat
[95,112,113]. Indeed, it has been suggested for some time
that measures of energy efficiency could be used as
indexes of fitness to learn more about the organisation of
biochemical networks [96,111,116].
Another example of a computable fitness correlate has
been given recently in the work that preceded the more
extensive description of evolutionary systems biology
given here [196]. Using the example of a simple circadian
clock it was demonstrated how a fitness correlate could be
defined in order to capture the correct timing of recurrent
gene expression if the latter is essential for growth. Briefly,
in the system of interest an internal signal is identified
that is used to switch on or off the genes that are optimal
for a given external environment that changes regularly.
The internal signal can be in sync with the external one or
it can be completely out of sync or it can be dominated by
randomness. Simulations of the system can be used to
determine the fraction of all time, where the internal signal switches 'on' the genes (e.g. photosynthesis) that are
optimal for the current state of the environment (e.g. day)
[196]. The large impact of internal predictions of daily
rhythms on various observable fitness correlates has been
demonstrated experimentally [226,227]. It can be
assumed that the absolute amount of time where genes
are out of sync with the environment influences fitness
directly. Thus there is scope for testing the LFCH in this
system [196]; examples for insights into the distribution
of mutational effects that can be obtained by assuming
the LFCH in this system are discussed below.

BMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:27

Computable fitness correlates can be constructed for
many other systems. For example, one could consider the
probability that a signal transduction pathway triggers a
defined response: using simulations it could be investigated how probable it is that a pathogen induced activation of a signalling molecule at the cell surface will result
in the activation of a nuclear response that switches on the
genes needed for fighting the pathogen (it is clear that survival is reduced if this probability is reduced). One could
also estimate the amount of energy needed to produce
proteins [228] and the speed and accuracy with which
that happens [229-232]. Combining such estimates with
simulations of ribosomes might help us to assess the
impact of mutations in the translational machinery.
It is important to note that models, which attempt to
define computable fitness correlates, do not have to be
perfect in order to be useful. In fact, some important conclusions are not affected by the omission of many details.
To appreciate the importance of this point one has to consider the extraordinary crude models of fitness that are
often used with great success in evolutionary biology.
Against that backdrop many simple inclusions of mechanistic knowledge in fitness models appear like major
advances. For example, almost arbitrarily defined biochemical reaction networks have been used to investigate
their evolution [233-236].
Distribution of Mutational Effects (DME)
Since high-dimensional adaptive landscapes are very difficult to navigate and virtually impossible to visualise,
researchers have been developing abstractions that provide a more accessible picture. One such abstraction is the
Distribution of Mutational Effects (DME). Traditionally,
two approaches have been used for estimating DMEs. The
experimental approach accumulates mutations and directly
estimates effects on an observable fitness correlate
[51,68,237-241]. All experimental methods are labour
intensive and unavoidable experimental errors make it
impossible to observe small effects. This is a major limitation, since most mutational effects are expected to be
below the threshold of detection [2,242]. Therefore, population genetical methods have become increasingly popular
[2,1,66,243-245]. These methods combine an evolutionary model with observed DNA sequence data in order to
estimate which DME explains the observed data best.
They allow the detection of very small effective selection
coefficients (on the order of 1/Ne, where Ne is the effective
population size). However, they have almost no power to
estimate very large effects and their results can strongly
depend on the assumed model of evolution. Difficulties
become even more pronounced, when these methods are
used to infer the fraction of adaptive substitutions. Experimental and population genetical approaches have in
common, that they estimate a generic distribution for a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/27

sample of sites in the genome. The resulting DME is
descriptive and has no underlying mechanistic basis.
Since the DME is of extraordinary importance, it would be
desirable if a completely independent approach could be
used to confirm findings. Evolutionary systems biology
could provide such an approach, which was first described
elsewhere [196]. This approach is based on current systems biology models with fitness correlates and does not
suffer from the weakness of the other approaches. It can
also be used to estimate DMEs that affect any emerging
property and is not limited to fitness correlates. However,
at its best it can only estimate the DME in a specific system, not in a representative genomic sample.
Observation of DMEs in silico
To observe a DME for a well-defined biological system
with a corresponding computable model one can use the
current wildtype as a point of reference and then compute
the fitness effects (or other effects) of many random mutations, using the following steps:

1. Choose an interesting wildtype parameter set as
starting point.
2. Choose a realistic distribution of mutational effects
on the kinetic parameters to model the effects of
changes in DNA sequences on kinetic parameters (see
discussion below).
3. Scale the frequencies of mutations that affect the
various kinetic parameters according to the size of
their respective mutational targets and their corresponding mutation rates. Bigger proteins usually
mutate more often than smaller ones.
4. Do many one-step random perturbations of the
wildtype and compute the mean fitness (or other
property) for each of them to as many decimal digits
as you need to measure the smallest selection coefficients (or other effects) that you want to predict.
5. Summarise the differences to the reference genotype
as a DME. Since a logscale is best to visualise the
expected majority of small effects, it may be preferable
to use two log-scaled distributions, one for deleterious
mutations and a separate one for advantageous mutations (see [196] for a plot that was especially designed
for visualising the DME).
The quality of in silico DMEs
The quality of DMEs inferred by this approach depends
on the quality of the underlying systems biology model,
the fitness correlates, their calibration and the assumed
distributions of kinetic parameters. If high quality fitness
correlate calibrations and realistic distributions of kinetic

Page 17 of 34

BMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:27

parameters are available together with estimates of Ne, the
effective population size of the species that carries this system, then the fraction of effectively neutral changes can be
computed approximately by lumping together all mutational effects with a selection coefficient s < 1/Ne.
To estimate the overall fraction of absolutely beneficial
mutations no calibration is necessary. It suffices to determine how many mutational effects increase or decrease
the fitness correlate. The overall type of this distribution
should also be obtainable without accurate scaling, allowing tests of the expectation that advantageous mutational
effects are distributed exponentially [2,142,240]. However, to determine the fraction of effectively beneficial
mutations, a proper scaling becomes important again,
since such mutations have to be distinguished from effectively neutral mutations. Again, effectively neutral and
advantageous mutations are approximately separated at s
≈ 1/Ne.
Estimating a precise DME requires knowledge of the first
two levels of adaptive landscapes described above (mapping from genotype to molecular structure to molecular
function). In other words, it is important to know how
DNA changes translate into changed kinetic properties for
the macromolecules in the system. Several solutions to
this problem are possible. Ideally, one might want to
introduce the random changes at the level of DNA
sequences and use a reliable molecular ab initio prediction system to determine the resulting changes in kinetics
that are then used as input for the corresponding systems
biology models. Unfortunately, this overstretches the
capabilities of current ab initio modelling approaches
[164]. The two next best solutions have been described
above in more detail while discussing the first two levels of
adaptive landscapes. One solution is to use comparative
modelling of structures based on changed sequences and
then comparative modelling of kinetic properties based
on changed structures. These methods work particularly
well for small changes and thus appear suitable for investigating DMEs. However, currently no ready-to-use pipeline exists that allows non-specialists to go the whole way
from DNA sequences to kinetic rates for all proteins that
are known well enough. The other next best solution is to
employ random mutagenesis experiments to measure
the distributions of kinetic changes that are caused by random DNA changes in the corresponding genes. Technological advances might help to increase the accuracy of
measurements enough to capture all important changes
for DME predictions and to reduce the corresponding
work enough to allow regular use of such technology for
assessing new kinetic properties in new proteins. However, at the moment such random mutagenesis experiments are laborious and functional assays for most genes
are probably not accurate enough to capture the over-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/27

whelming majority of very small effects that are expected
in DMEs based on population genetic inferences [2,93].
The third best solution is to use specific reasonable evidence-based assumed distributions for how kinetic
parameters change with DNA sequence changes. This
approach uses general observations from comparative
modelling and random mutagenesis experiments in generally similar macromolecules to propose reasonable estimates of the expected distribution, even if no specific data
are available for the specific genes under consideration.
The emergence of universal patterns of some effects in
proteins support this approach [172,173]. However,
reducing the rigour applied in the construction of such
assumed distributions puts one on a slippery slope
towards arbitrary assumptions. As this solution is least
desirable in terms of quality and most desirable in terms
of ease of implementation, one might ask if such a large
unknown does not necessarily invalidate all other simulation efforts at higher levels. While there is clearly the
potential for this to happen, a sensible simulation strategy
can nevertheless learn valuable insights from employing
such an approach:
• Three point estimates. One could use an approximate minimum, most likely and maximum value for
the kinetic parameter in question to assess its expected
contribution to the computed fitness correlate. The
corresponding computations are easy to do and
should quickly indicate, whether the parameter in
question is stiff or sloppy (see Box on modelling
below). The former highlights the need for more indepth analysis that could justify experiments, while
the latter might suggest that the role of this parameter
is too small to warrant further attention.
• Varying distributions. If preliminary calculations
indicate that a kinetic parameter is of some importance, one can assume several distributions of this
parameter that are chosen to be as different as possible, but still compatible with the limited data available. Using such an ensemble of distributions of
different types and with different location and shape
parameters, one can ask how high-level emergent
properties are influenced by assumptions about lowlevel distributions of kinetic rates. A possible result
could be that many features of low-level distributions
have only little influence on high-level distributions.
Such parameter sensitivity analyses can guide experiments to investigate those properties of low-level distributions that make a difference in silico.
DME nomenclature and DME plots
As evident from the text above, systems biology analyses
of mutational effects generate many different DMEs at various levels of the adaptive landscape. They differ in the

Page 18 of 34
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:27

mutational input they assume (equivalent to the plane of a
landscape) and in the output effects they produce (equivalent to the height of a landscape). To specify DMEs precisely and concisely a new nomenclature was developed
[196]. Since all biologically interesting properties of
DMEs are notoriously difficult to visualise in one plot, a
special new type of histogram was designed to provide a
quick visual overview over DMEs [196].
Exemplary results
To illustrate the power of this new approach, a systems
biology model of a very simple circadian clock mechanism has been analysed with the help of stochastic simulations [196]. This model assumes an almost arbitrary
distribution of kinetic effects of DNA changes to bridge
levels 1–2 of the adaptive landscape. It then simulates a
very simple systems biology model at level 3 and defines a
computable fitness correlate at level 4. In a further gross
simplification the computable fitness correlate is assumed
to be identical with the actual fitness of an individual
(jumping levels 5–6). Here are the key observations from
that analysis:

• Null-Hypothesis. In some situations it appeared
that changes in the low-level distribution of kinetic
rates were closely mirrored by changes in the highlevel distribution of an emergent property of the system. This appears to be trivial enough to serve as a
null-hypothesis against which 'canalisation' could be
detected (see section on robustness below).
• Inversions. In some situations a decrease or increase
of the low-level rate led to the corresponding opposite
effect on the emergent property. It will be interesting
to see how frequently such inversions can be found in
more extensive studies.
• DMEs are context dependent. Epistasis was
expected in this system. However, it is interesting that
this work opens a new approach towards quantifying
epistasis. With the extensive possibilities for manipulating such simulation models, epistasis research
might be able to address new questions.
• Changing a good clock usually degrades it. Again,
this was expected, but it is reassuring to recover such
common sense results from simulations. Future work
will be able to quantify much more precisely how
many out of all possible low-level parameter changes
are expected to be harmful at higher levels.
• Changing a bad clock can improve it. It was possible to detect advantageous mutations in the limited
parameter space searches that were conducted. It was
particularly interesting to find a parameter combina-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/27

tion, where both increase and decrease of a particular
kinetic parameter led to fitness correlate increases. Further work will have to investigate how frequent such
situations are.
Many questions can be asked about the simple simulation
model employed in this study (the clock model has no
entrainment and ignores most of the interactions that circadian clock research has uncovered in recent years) and
the usefulness of the conclusions drawn from it. All these
questions can be addressed by building more realistic
models; the main purpose of this pilot study was to demonstrate the type of data that this approach can generate
[196]. Future work can use the same principles to arrive at
much more precise and interesting results.
What can be expected from such analyses?
While any single analysis will not be very insightful from
a general point of view, there are two big questions one
would like to ask of a reasonably sized sample of such
analyses: First, how different are the DMEs for different
systems? A system in this context stands for any molecular
systems biological model – no matter how small – that
allows the computation of a fitness correlate. It is conceivable that each system has its own very peculiar DME and
cannot be compared to any other known system. However, it is equally conceivable that the general properties of
complex systems somewhat smooth out the differences,
which would imply that most DMEs look rather similar.

Second, if such general properties exist, is it possible to
find a theoretical justification for the expected distribution? A recent comparison of various types of distributions of deleterious mutational effects has found that the
lognormal distribution explained the data best in that
example [93]. If the extent of a reduction in fitness caused
by a deleterious mutation is a multiplicative function of
the damage that it causes at several independent functional levels, then one expects a lognormal distribution of
mutational effects [93]. It will be interesting to see if a lognormal distribution, as in Figure 4, turns out to be a reasonable null-model for the distribution of mutational
effects on fitness in the long term.
In any case, the DME is of such fundamental importance
for robustness [246], and so difficult to estimate, that
multiple approaches are needed to develop confidence in
any particular result [2]. The strength of the approach proposed here is that it opens up access to very small mutational effects without the need for assuming or inferring a
particular evolutionary model. Thus it can be seen as a
third principal approach besides direct experimental
measurements and DNA sequence based inferences that
assume evolutionary models [196].

The analyses of DMEs above open up a new approach
towards measuring canalisation rigorously for a pair of
DMEs. One of these DMEs needs to be a low-level DME
like the distribution of mutational effects on the kinetic
properties of a given enzyme. The other DME needs to
quantify an emergent property of the system like the production rate of biomass. The different scales of low-level
and high-level properties are mapped to the unit-less
scales of DMEs that record relative deviations from the
wild type on their x-axis. Thus, the null-hypothesis is true,
if for all possible values of x

effects. Selection coefficients range from effectively neutral
on the left up to lethal on the far right. The vertical line
denotes the border between effective neutrality and effective
selection. Both distributions assume a lognormal law, the
light grey distribution also assumes a separate class of completely neutral mutations with a frequency of 2.5%. Estimates
applied an evolutionary model that included mutation, selection, genetic drift and backmutations [1,55] to data from Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. miranda. For more details, see
[93]. All selection coefficients beyond 1 ('super-lethals')
denote an abstract notion of structural damage to the organism. Such damage cannot be more than lethal and is thus represented as lethal in evolutionary models.

where the indices m and wt, low and hi denote mutant and
wild type values for low-level and high-level properties,
respectively. Then canalisation is defined as occurring
when the variance of the lower level DME is larger than
that of the higher level DME (Figure 5). Correspondingly,
one might observe capacitance as the opposite of canalisa-

Robustness, canalisation and capacitance
Canalisation reduces the sensitivity of a phenotype to
changes in the underlying factors that determine its
expression [247,248]. It is important for understanding
robustness which is of interest to current systems biology
[246] and current systems biology models have been used
successfully to investigate it [249,250,199-201]. Canalisation was introduced by Waddington to explain the robustness of phenotypes that he observed in experiments [251]
and researchers have struggled to provide a precise basis
for quantifying it [247,252]. Recent work has started to
uncover some of its underlying molecular basis (e.g.
[253]). The opposite of canalisation has been termed
'capacitance' to highlight the adaptive possibilities that
can come with the expression of new heritable phenotypic
variation [250,126,253,254]. The consequences of
robustness, canalisation and capacitance can be very obvious in many developmental pathways due to their effect
on morphology. Thus these concepts play a major role in
'evo-devo' that combines evolutionary biology and developmental biology [124-126,199-211]. The concept of
robustness is also pivotal in the study of biochemical reaction networks [246,255-260].

Let's assume a low-level property such as the kinetic rate of
an enzyme has a certain distribution of mutational effects
(black line) and influences a high-level property such as a fitness correlate (filled area). If the variance of the high-level
property is smaller than that of the low-level property, then
the high-level property can be said to experience 'canalisation'. Conversely, the high-level property experiences 'capacitance' if its variance is larger. To make these two properties
comparable, their values on the x-axis are both plotted as
relative deviations [(xmutant - xwild)/xwild].

BMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:27

tion, when the variance of the lower-level DME is smaller
than that of the higher-level DME (Figure 5). This definition applies equally if x is plotted on linear or logarithmic
axes, as long as the same transformation is applied to both
DMEs (logarithms facilitate visualising very small mutational effects; for more details on how to produce DME
plots, see [196]). Such analyses can explore the question
whether high-level DMEs depend more on the intermolecular interactions captured in complex systems biology
models or on the low-level intramolecular interactions
within proteins that determine reaction rates. While both
are expected to contribute, a more precise answer is
important for current systems biology modelling in general. Canalisation and capacitance are caused by epistatic
interactions.
Epistasis
Another abstraction of the adaptive landscape is the distribution of epistatic effects. Epistasis is defined as any deviation from an independent combination of mutational
effects, which under a multiplicative fitness model is
obtained by simply multiplying the fitness values of both
mutants. Evolutionary genetics has explored many of the
enormous consequences of particular types of epistasis
[90,92,261,262,248,247,91]. However, there is much
uncertainty when it comes to determine which type of epistatic interactions occurs how often. Studies so far have
consistently demonstrated that synergistic and antagonistic epistasis are fairly common in nature and while they
might almost cancel each other out on average, they show
significant
variance
around
their
mean
[94,16,262,263,143]. Less is known about the frequency
of sign epistasis, which decreases the fitness of intermediate mutants below that of the wildtype, even though the
fitness of the final mutant is above that of the wildtype
[91,92]. Despite the importance of epistasis in evolution,
models that explore evolution in the presence of epistasis
use rather simple models of epistasis and often allow only
for one constant type of epistasis. Since epistasis is caused
by the underlying molecular interaction networks, the use
of fitness correlates as defined above can help explore it.
Indeed some early work has used metabolic control theory to investigate epistasis [262] and the origins of dominance [114]. Recent work has suggested that a synthesis of
current systems biology models and quantitative genetics
methods can successfully investigate epistasis [264,265].

To examine the distribution of epistatic effects in the simplest case one may consider just two mutational steps:
1. Reference. Compute the fitness of the current
wildtype as a reference (W). Generally compute mutational effects as if estimating a DME, so the same caveats apply.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/27

2. Independent estimates. As in analyses of the DME,
these always start with the wildtype. Add each random
mutation separately to the wildtype and compute the
resulting fitness. Thus, the two mutations A and B will
result in the fitness values WA and WB, respectively.
3. Combined estimate. Starting with the wildtype,
add all mutations from the previous step at once and
then compute their combined effect on fitness. This
results in one single fitness value, WAB in our example.
4. Compare. In the absence of epistasis the product of
all independent fitness values equals the combined fitness of all mutations in one genotype (if fitness is multiplicative). The difference between these two
indicates the type and size of the epistatic effect.
5. Distribution. To obtain a distribution of epistatic
effects, repeat (2) – (4) for many random perturbations of the system. At the same time consider quantifying sign epistasis [91].
Repeating such an analysis for several different fixed starting points gives a crude high-level overview of epistasis for
the model under investigation. The procedure above outlines only the simplest case of '2-step epistasis'. The resulting distribution will strongly depend on the number of
mutational steps analysed, so n different mutations need
to be analysed for one measurement of epistasis in order
to understand n-step epistasis. To get a thorough understanding of 'general' epistasis in a system, one needs to
analyse the distribution of epistatic effects for a wide range
of different n.
A distribution of 2-step epistatic effects has been obtained
in silico by using flux balance analysis in yeast [16,266].
The approach above extends in silico methods to general
current systems biology models that often cannot be analysed with flux balance analysis. As with the DME, the
main strength of this framework is in facilitating many
independent observations that help searching for general
patterns (or documenting their absence). Analysing n-step
epistasis for large n can also help investigate the frequency
of compensatory mutations at the molecular level, a question that has recently been addressed experimentally [7678].
Testing evolutionary hypotheses
Hypothesis testing in evolutionary biology has become
increasingly important and sophisticated [267,105].
Many phylogenetic hypotheses completely ignore selection and treat all DNA sequences as neutral, although they
implicitly consider the effects of selection by allowing for
different rates at which new mutations are substituted

Page 21 of 34
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:27

along lines of descent. This approach has been very successful in testing various hypotheses [42,267-270].
In contrast, many population genetic hypotheses explicitly test for selection. Using selective neutrality as a nullhypothesis, population genetic tests can detect positive or
negative selection that causes deviations from neutral patterns
of
DNA
sequence
evolution
[105,42,
1,93,60,271,272,244]. Such work can highlight sites in
the genome that are under a given type of selection. In
some cases the results may be specific enough to inspire
mechanistic explanations for the molecular causes behind
the observations. Indeed, genomic analyses have been
searching for 'candidate genes' of potential medical interest [67,62].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/27

could point out gaps in our current understanding of a
system (e.g. see [273]) and thus motivate further work
towards the construction of hypotheses that are both
quantitative and free of conflicts.
Developing evolutionary systems biology up to the point
where such analyses become commonplace is a 'grand
challenge' and will take a long time if it is possible at all.
We can expect to gain many new insights by working
towards this goal, even if such analyses are too complicated to become commonplace. Such work will contribute
towards unifying biology (Figure 1) and will need to integrate various approaches towards understanding biology
(Table 3).

Discussion
However, current population genetic studies have no formal power to distinguish between different mechanistic
explanations for why selection operates where it does if
these explanations suggest the same DNA sequence patterns. Such questions could be answered with some rigor
if fully developed evolutionary systems biology models
were available as null-hypotheses. The ability to construct
such models is closely linked to the ability to predict the
likely courses of evolution out of all potentially conceivable courses of evolution (e.g. [91,157]) and is related to
the functional synthesis of molecular biology experiments
and evolutionary theory that was used to reconstruct
ancient adaptive events [95,112,113].
The ultimate goal of evolutionary systems biology is to
quantitatively test evolutionary hypotheses that are fully
mechanistic, predict all phenotypes of interest ab initio
from their respective genotypes and that are ecologically
realistic (Figure 1). This ambitious research programme
critically depends on the various more specific research
programmes described above that predict phenotypes
from genotypes with the help of computable fitness correlates. These predictions need to be incorporated into realistic ecological and population genetical models that
describe how selection and the various other evolutionary
forces affect a population of individuals. Provided enough
computing power is available, evolution under the resulting model could be observed in individual-based simulations by applying the evolutionary forces of mutation,
selection, genetic drift, recombination and migration to a
population that moves on the adaptive landscape. Tracking the evolution of such a population in silico and comparing these results to observations could provide a
unique capability to test complex evolutionary hypotheses (Figure 1). For many questions the evolving population will consist of individuals in an ecosystem. However
it can also consist of cells in a body, a perspective that is
pivotal for understanding the origins and progression of
cancer [192]. Evolutionary systems biology simulations

There are historical precedents for successful interactions
between evolutionary genetics and systems biology as evidenced by the interactions and interests of some of the
founding fathers of the respective fields. Kacser used metabolic control theory to explain the molecular basis of
dominance [114]. In doing so he supported Wright's
hypothesis on the same topic [185] and contributed to a
long debate in evolutionary genetics [274-277]. Metabolic
control theory was also used to make predictions about
the expected intensity of selection on enzymes with different control coefficients [183,184,187,115] and about
epistasis [262]. Others have long suggested a development similar to evolutionary systems biology, namely
bringing together the analysis of bioenergetics and evolution [95,96,111-113,116]. Interactions are by no means a
one-way street. J.B.S. Haldane, who is best known as an
evolutionary biologist, used the quantitative skills he
developed for population genetical analyses to make a
fundamental contribution to systems biology by introducing the quasi-equilibrium approximation to Michaelis-Menten kinetics [278], still widely used in current
systems biology. Likewise, current systems biology can
benefit from expertise in the quantitative analysis of complex systems that has been developed in evolutionary
biology.
This study proposes a multilayered mechanistic framework for evolutionary systems biology (short EvoSysBio)
that centres on fitness, the adaptive landscape and the
quantitative modelling of evolutionary processes. However, other approaches to EvoSysBio are possible too. For
example, comparative EvoSysBio can analyse how phenomenological descriptions of systems like gene networks
differ across species [279,280]. Comparative EvoSysBio
can help identify functionally important differences
between species. It flows naturally from the wide availability of systems biology data sets for many species. EvoSysBio can also be approached in a 'target-oriented' way
without the principled framework described above. One

1 As analogy, think of a biologist made of flesh and blood. Just bones and flesh are dead unless they breathe air, drink water and eat food. This
illustrates that good theoretical models need to be designed to incorporate experimental data in order to 'come alive'. A good intuition is needed
to develop such models. Heuristic models can be very good in predicting observations, but true understanding grows only when models reflect true
causalities.

could define target-oriented EvoSysBio as combining at
least one current systems biology approach with at least
one evolutionary genetics approach to facilitate the
understanding of a particular system. For example, one
can study correlations between the various systems biological and evolutionary properties of genes [280]. Also,
the large interest of current systems biology in cancer and
the evolutionary nature of cancer naturally inspire such
EvoSysBio work [281]. Network-oriented EvoSysBio can
be considered as target-oriented EvoSysBio aiming to
understand the evolution of generic features of biochemical networks like robustness [281,255-260,282]. All these
approaches to EvoSysBio can produce valuable insights
without the framework presented above. Many of these
insights are likely to contribute towards building the multilayered mechanistic EvoSysBio models proposed above.
The goal of constructing such models is expected to
inspire the generation of a wide range of quantitative
hypotheses and critically depends on a diverse body of
detailed work in many fields. Such work has not been
labelled 'EvoSysBio' (and does not need to be).
Readers with mathematical skills will have missed the formal definition of many important concepts in the overview presented here. This is in part due to space

limitations that prohibit a proper review of concepts that
have been developed elsewhere (see references cited). Further, the aim of this article is to provide a motivational
overview of the new field of EvoSysBio in order to inspire
the development of corresponding formalisms. Such formal definitions will facilitate the proposal and rigorous
testing of many new hypotheses. The success of EvoSysBio
critically depends on progress towards properly quantifying the concepts presented above. This will be strongly
influenced by answers to the following critical questions.
Critical questions
The limited evidence that already exists makes it easy to
guess preliminary answers to the following critical questions one may ask about EvoSysBio. Obtaining more reliable answers depends on the investigation of a multitude
of systems, amounting to a major research program.

• What proportion of current systems biology models allow the definition of meaningful fitness correlates that possess enough accuracy to be useful and
that are still computationally tractable?
It is clear that some such systems can be defined, but
it is not clear how difficult this will be for 'typical' bio-

Page 23 of 34
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:27

logical systems of interest. Thus it will also be interesting to describe systems where no meaningful fitness
correlates could be found. It will be interesting to see
if it can be formally defined how 'useful' a proposed
fitness correlate is or whether this will remain in the
domain of biological intuition.
• What proportion of the results of evolutionary systems biology analyses are similar to one another?
If common patterns emerge, it might become much
easier to analyse more systems. If all results are highly
system specific, this will help avoid unwarranted generalisations.
• What proportion of the distribution of mutational
effects on fitness is determined at which level?
Do intra-protein interactions that only affect kinetic
parameters contribute more than intra-cellular reaction network interactions or still higher levels of functionality that affect emergent properties more directly?
In other words, where does most of the canalisation
happen? If most of the variability is caused by intramolecular interactions, then the corresponding data is
vital for the overall success of current systems biology
models in this context. How important is a detailed
understanding of structure-function relationships
within proteins for understanding the robustness of
molecular systems biological models?
• What proportion of all model input parameters
can be determined with enough accuracy for the
analyses proposed here?
A typical critique of 'model everything' approaches is
that there are too many parameters that one would
need to know for such models to be of value. Analyses
have shown that in most models not all parameters
are of equal importance [194]. Thus it might not matter, if some parameters remain poorly defined, as long
as one can develop methods to demonstrate that these
parameters are not pivotal for the models of interest.
Will it be possible to determine every important
parameter with sufficient accuracy?
• Which approach can accurately predict most
molecular kinetic parameter changes that are caused
by DNA sequence changes?
Can experimental approaches attain the level of precision required for evolutionary analyses or do we have
to rely on computers? Is precise ab initio modelling
possible on commodity hardware or does this always
require super computers (if possible at all)? Can exper-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/27

imental random mutagenesis approaches be faster in
determining low-level DMEs than ab initio modelling
approaches? The worth of each method for practical
use is a trade-off between the cost, speed and accuracy
of prediction. It is unclear whether high-throughput
experiments or high-performance computers or very
clever algorithms will dominate eventually, as the
development of all three approaches progresses very
fast.
• What proportion of predicted distributions of
mutational effects or distributions of epistatic
effects can be confirmed in the laboratory?
In principle, one should be able to devise corresponding mutagenesis or evolution experiments, but it is
unclear how much power they usually have for testing
in silico models. Experiments are integral for calibrating fitness correlates but they should also play a role as
measures of quality control for completely integrated
evolutionary systems biology models. Synthetic biology can also contribute towards testing evolutionary
systems biology models.
Will the excitement in current systems biology survive the
forces that ended a similar wave of excitement about modelling in ecological systems biology a few decades ago
[40,41]? The answer is likely to depend on the quantitative rigour of the models and the quality of their links to
observed biological data (see Table 3). An evolutionary
perspective might contribute towards such quality. While
molecular biologists do not need to become evolutionary
geneticists and vice versa, some understanding of both
fields is helpful for contributing towards the synthesis presented here.
Benefits for current systems biology
Evolutionary perspectives can contribute much to current
systems biology, as well as to many related agricultural
[283] and medical [192] questions. Here are some examples:

• Robustness needs to be understood for improving
drug-design [284]. Distributions of mutational effects
need to be analysed in order to minimise medical side
effects, as patients will carry the corresponding mutations. This is particularly crucial for drugs that are used
on the long term.
• Diseases. Understanding cancer drives much interest
in current systems biology. It is less appreciated than
probably necessary that cancer is, by its very nature, an
evolutionary problem: A population of mutating cells
gains selective growth advantages in an environment
and starts to evolve into a meta-population by build-

BMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:27

ing metastases. To understand cancer means to understand the evolution of these populations of cells. Thus
many concepts that are of importance in population
genetics are also pivotal for understanding cancer,
including the distribution of mutational effects,
epistasis and robustness of the various genes that are
involved in producing cancer [192,285,286].
Improved mechanistic models of cancer could have
practical implications too. For example, current predictions of life expectancy are usually based on regression analyses of data that shows how long patients
survived if they shared particular properties like specific mutations [287,288]. In the long term it might be
possible to construct mechanistic models of the corresponding signal transduction pathways and other
processes that might add a more rigorous basis and
possibly more precision to such estimates. Recent
work points into this direction [289]. Mechanistic evolutionary models have also helped to understand
other diseases (e.g. the Apert syndrome [290]).
• Resistance. The evolution of antibiotic resistance is
one of the big problems of our time and if new drugs
do not come with instructions on how to slow down
resistance evolution, their effectiveness can be rather
short lived [291-293]. Detailed evolutionary systems
biology models could predict resistance evolution in
silico and thus help to develop approaches to reduce
resistance evolution. The same holds for other pathogens. For example, the HIV research community relies
on an understanding of HIV evolution for developing
therapies [294].
• Agriculture. A thorough understanding of long-term
evolution is essential for a sustainable use of natural
resources [295]. Informed decisions are needed about
how to use the new crops with increased yields that
can be generated by plant systems biology
[36,283,296-298].
• Synthetic biology. Insights into the distributions of
mutational effects are vital for understanding robustness and thus for both, the genetic engineering of synthetic biological systems and the genetic modification
of existing ones. The prominence of engineering principles in synthetic biology [299-301] highlights the
importance of understanding all sources of variability
in the system. Each instance of a responsible release of
these organisms into the wild requires thorough ecological analyses of the synthetic organisms' evolutionary potential to avoid unnecessary damage to existing
ecosystems.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/27

• Population genetics. Some current systems biology
models can be enriched by including data from population genetic surveys of single nucleotide polymorphisms [302].
An evolutionary perspective can inspire new questions
about current systems biology models by calling for investigations of distributions of mutational effects, epistatic
effects and their long-term consequences. This is especially important, if the molecular systems under investigation exist in large populations for frequent long-term use
in natura, as this allows small changes to add up to large
consequences. The approach for estimating mutational
effects presented here promises to be much more sensitive
than current experimental methods and may thus increase
our ability to predict evolution on longer timescales.

Conclusion
The new framework presented here facilitates exploring
general characteristics of living systems by combining current systems biology and evolutionary theory in order to
address some of the most difficult problems in biology,
including the distribution of mutational effects, robustness and the distribution of epistatic effects. These concepts are different ways of making statements about the
adaptive landscape that governs the evolution of life. The
methods suggested here will facilitate limited excursions
into the adaptive landscape of particular molecular systems. These excursions will provide results that live
between two extremes: (i) either each system is completely different and generalisations are virtually useless
or (ii) the general complex nature of most systems will
lead to fairly stable general properties that are easy to predict once the basic patterns are understood. An absence of
experiments to calibrate fitness correlates limits the precision and hence applicability of results gathered by the
proposed framework. In that case answers will only be
rough and qualitative. Given the crudeness of many current models of fitness effects in evolutionary biology, this
will nevertheless be a significant step forward, especially if
many such rough models are built and common features
start to emerge. Such experience will facilitate a deeper
understanding of the adaptive landscape in evolutionary
biology and may motivate exchanges with the other two
fields that investigate adaptive landscapes: evolutionary
computation, which investigates the adaptive landscapes
of complex engineering problems and artificial life, which
investigates general properties of life at the most abstract
level (Figure 6). The advances in the field of artificial life
suggest that fundamental insights might be gained from
such exchanges [303-305]. The feasibility of exploring
high-dimensional functional landscapes with the help of
molecular systems biological models has been demonstrated by a computational study that investigated the
sloppiness of parameter sensitivities. This study compared

17 detailed models and suggests that universal principles
might exist [194]. The effort to make such analyses useful
for evolutionary questions should be manageable and pay
rich dividends.
Evolutionary systems biology has already been described
as a nascent field, albeit in a context that either compares
phenomenological descriptions of systems across species
or that dissects correlations between multiple genomerelated variables [279,280]. Emerging work at the interface between functional molecular biology, genomics,
systems biology and evolution (e.g. [108,306,13,
87,16,302,307,107,196,95,96,111-113,256,279,280]) is
bound to lead to the growth of evolutionary systems biology approaches. Quantitative rigor as described in Appendix 1 will be pivotal for the success of such work. Nothing
in biology makes sense except properly quantified in the light of
evolution.

Appendix 1: The art of modelling
The goal of modelling in biology is simple: describe an
abstraction of reality that predicts natural processes, is
mechanistically understood and remains as simple as possible. Since reality is complex, scientists often engage in a
quest for models that increase in complexity at an astonishing rate, sometimes at the expense of clarity. While this
causes some to argue for simpler, more reductionist models, others emphasise complexity to approximate reality
more closely [308]. As much of this debate is based on
personal preferences, one could take a more pragmatic
approach, assuming that
• All models are wrong, but some are useful [309].
• Sometimes simpler models are better, unless statistical evidence demonstrates a significant increase in predictive power for a more complex model.
• Sometimes more complex models are better, unless
it can be argued convincingly that all additional complexity does not impact the model behaviour significantly.
• Useful models have to be falsifiable.
• Errors need to be managed, for example, by starting
simple and then adding complexity after the simple
model has been understood. Starting complex can
make errors difficult to find due to a lack of understanding.
• Models are there to do a job; time for model construction has to be limited if time should be left for
analysing models in the real world.

This mix of Occam's razor, Popper's philosophy [310],
practical advice and statistical theory [311,312] is a powerful tool for understanding our world and has been particularly successful in molecular biology and evolutionary
theory (e.g. [42]). The importance of the simplicity of
models is hotly debated, as some fear that adding parameters will obscure the core effects that are being analysed.
Others fear that an artificial restriction of complexity will
probably lead to the omission of key parameters that have
a huge influence on the overall prediction errors. This
fuels the desire in current systems biology to build comprehensive models that faithfully map the whole system
and are independent of the questions that one might ask
about such models. This approach is fundamentally different from the reductionistic perspective, as these complex models contain all the logic to 'simplify themselves'
if only a simple question is being asked; in contrast to
that, in the reductionistic approach the researcher performs the task of simplification by selecting what to
include in a simple model. It is difficult to decide in general, whether researchers or automatic formalisms make
fewer errors in simplifying complex models; the answer
strongly depends on the formalisms and the system studied. It is not difficult to predict that human researchers
working on any non-trivial modelling project will introduce errors that can matter scientifically and are challenging do detect. Having more than one strategy for
debugging is extraordinarily helpful here. In the context of
the debate on reductionism vs. holism, it is important to
note the advantage of starting model construction at the
simple end and progressing towards larger complexities,
as the simpler models are understood.

As complex models are notorious for their computational
complexity, a compromise may be helpful. One can build
the more complex models and explore in computational
parameter sensitivity analyses which processes exert how
much influence on the system. Thus it becomes possible
to identify parts of the model that are indeed unimportant
for a particular problem, while being sure that all known
processes are being considered. In a second step the unimportant parts can be omitted to save computing time.
Such an exploration of complex models is made feasible
by computational advances. A steady stream of new
research has driven knowledge far beyond what must have
once appeared as science fiction. In molecular biology this
has led to the recent emergence of current systems biology
[29], which aims at integrating data about molecular
processes inside organisms, often using approaches
inspired by engineering [212,213]. Evolutionary theory is
equally successful and has become an essential tool for
analysing genome sequences [313,61,62]. Both branches
of biology owe much of their success to the various complementary ways of understanding biology listed in Table
3. The recent increases of computing power and the need
for more complex models have also led to a rise in computer simulations that aim at bridging the gap between
the simplicity of tractable analytical models and the complexity of reality.
Traditionally, biologists were only aware of two
approaches to understanding biology: experiment and
theory, where many theoreticians greeted with suspicion
every model that was not completely analytically understood. Table 3 suggests a more differentiated picture that
includes mechanistic computer simulations of various
degrees of complexity as an equally valid approach to
knowledge. It is important to strike the right balance
between reductionism and realism [308] while using the
right tools and asking the right questions – which makes
modelling a form of abstract art. To strike the right balance it may be helpful to consider Figure 7 that depicts
various possible trade-offs between the systematic error
caused by using a simplified model and the random error
caused by using imprecise parameters [314,315]. If all
errors are equal and combine linearly (Figure 7A, [315]),
there will be an optimal model complexity that is related
to the 'Medawar zone' that describes the payoff and complexity of scientific problems ([316,317]. However, in
non-linear systems there will be 'stiff' and 'sloppy' parameters that exert large and small influences on the prediction errors of output parameters, respectively [194]. If
some parameters are stiff and well known (Figure 7B), it
will be advantageous to include them. If the same stiff
parameters are poorly known, one will have to collect
additional observations and invest in parameter estimation, as no meaningful predictions are possible otherwise

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/27

(Figure 7C). If the additional parameters turn out to be
sloppy (Figure 7D), they may as well be omitted, as their
inclusion does not advance predictions. Since it is often
difficult to determine in advance how important a particular parameter will be, there is considerable scope for the
production of realistic models if only for the purpose of
demonstrating that a simpler model is appropriate too.
Caution is necessary in these comparisons, as the addition
or removal of parameters is likely to be accompanied by a
change in the underlying non-linear logic of the simulation that can turn sloppy and stiff parameters into their
respective opposite.
Computer simulations are a relatively new approach to
generating knowledge and have not yet developed the
maturity that comes from centuries of experimental or
analytical theory work. While biologists are used to recognising good or poorly designed experiments and theoreticians know what can and cannot be proved, computer
simulations are sometimes greeted with suspicion by
both. To add to the confusion, computer scientists frequently talk about 'experiments' when they really mean a
set of simulations. Here is not the space to review
approaches to building quality simulations, but it is
important to stress that there are many pitfalls and
researchers in evolutionary systems biology have to
develop the skills needed to avoid the many traps in the
often interdisciplinary work of modelling and in the computer programming that goes with it [41,314,316-326].
The key challenges are to ensure that simulation results
are free from bugs that affect the biological model and
that the input parameters are relevant to the system that is
being studied. This demands that simulations are routinely linked to simpler test cases from analytical theory
(proved to be correct) and that model building includes a
significant effort to determine realistic ranges for the
parameters of the model. Simulations that are neither
linked to the hard dry bones of analytical theory, nor to
realistic biological parameters are the equivalent of a 'pile
of rotten flesh' in the analogy of Table 3. Such poor work
is responsible for much of the suspicion that 'non-simulation researchers' can have towards 'yet another simulation'.
Linking simulations to analytical theory is mostly manual
work nowadays. However, the development of process
algebras for simulating molecular reaction systems could
prove crucial in this respect. Process algebras are formal
languages that were designed to describe concurrent systems [327] and have recently been extended to allow the
modelling of intracellular chemical reactions [328]. The
beauty of a process algebra is in the independence of the
model specification from its implementation. This opens
the possibility of automatically translating the same
