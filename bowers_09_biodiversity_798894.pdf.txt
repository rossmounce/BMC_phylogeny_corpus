Abstract
Bacterial microorganisms that grow optimally at Na+ concentrations of 1.7 M, or the equivalent of
10% (w/v) NaCl, and greater are considered to be extreme halophiles. This review focuses on the
correlation between the extent of alkaline pH and elevated temperature optima and the extent of
salt tolerance of extremely halophilic eubacteria; the focus is on those with alkaline pH optima,
above 8.5, and elevated temperature optima, above 50°C. If all three conditions are required for
optimal growth, these microorganisms are termed "poly-extremophiles". However, only a very few
extreme halophiles able to grow optimally under alkaline conditions as well as at elevated
temperatures have been isolated so far. Therefore the question is: do the combined extreme
growth conditions of the recently isolated poly-extremophiles, i.e., anaerobic halophilic
alkalithermophiles, approach a physico-chemical boundary for life? These poly-extremophiles are
of interest, as their adaptive mechanisms give insight into organisms' abilities to survive in
environments which were previously considered prohibitive to life, as well as to possible properties
of early evolutionary and extraterrestrial life forms.

Extremely halophilic Bacteria
It is frequently asked: what are the physical and chemical
boundaries for life? How extreme can conditions become
and still support life? In respect to one extreme--haline
conditions--the answer is simple; growth has been
observed at saturated concentrations of sodium salts,
mainly NaCl. But what happens if one tries to increase the
solubility of these salts by increasing the temperature?
This overview deals with the diversity of bacteria able to
grow under concomitant extreme growth conditions,
namely high sodium salt concentration, alkaline pH and
elevated temperature, and thus with the recently isolated
anaerobic halophilic poly-extremophiles.

Different authors use different definitions for what constitutes a halophile; one definition identifies microorganisms which grow optimally at Na+ concentrations greater
than 0.2 M as halophiles [1]. For this review, the authors
wish to focus upon bacterial microorganisms that grow at
the upper limits of the combined extremes, and in the case
of halophiles, optimally at Na+ concentrations of 1.7 M,
or the equivalent of 10% NaCl. These microorganisms are
defined as extreme halophiles, in contrast to those microorganisms which merely tolerate such sodium concentrations or which grow optimally at marine salt
concentrations of approximately 3.5% w/v (Table 1). In
this review Na+ concentrations are given in mol/liter,

rather than % NaCl, since some of the alkaliphilic halophiles require media with carbonates, usually provided as
sodium carbonates, for pH control [2,3]. Therefore the
[Na+] comes both from the sodium carbonates and from
the supplemented NaCl. Many of the well-known extreme
halophiles are Archaea (over one hundred species in the
family Halobacteriacae alone); however, some extremely
halophilic bacteria have been described [see Additional
File 1], and this review will focus exclusively on extremely
halophilic Bacteria. These bacteria have been isolated
from various extreme environments such as solar thalassohaline salterns (i.e., originating from marine waters)
[4], athalassohaline (e.g., Wadi An Natrun, Egypt) [2] and
ancient thalassohaline (e.g., Great Salt Lake, UT, USA) [5]
salt lakes, marine environments [6], and fermented fish
sauces [7]. Additionally, among the validly published taxa
(i.e., published in, or publication validated by, the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology),
the extremely halophilic Bacteria are relatively equally distributed between aerobic and anaerobic species, with the
addition of four facultative anaerobes, such as Halomonas
sinaiensis [8] and Thiohalorhabdus denitrificans [9]. Examples of extremely halophilic bacteria--representing different types of extrema--include Halorhodospira halochloris
(basonym Ectothiorhodospira) [10], which, at 4.62 M, has
one of the highest [Na+] optima [11]; Halomonas taeanensis, which is capable of growing over the unusually wide
range of 0-5.13 M Na+ [12]; and Natranaerobius 'grantii',
which tolerates saturated NaCl concentrations in its
growth medium at elevated temperature and alkaline pH
[13].
Bacterial extreme halophiles exhibit various physiological
and nutritional properties [3,14-16] and belong to different phylogenetic groups such as the order Actinomycetales
from the phylum Actinobacteria; the order Sphingobacteriales from the phylum Bacteroidetes; the orders Bacillales,
Halanaerobiales and Natranaeriobiales from the phylum
Firmicutes; the orders Rhizobiales and Rhodospirillales from

the subphylum -Proteobacteria; and the orders Chromatiales, Oceanospirillales and Pseudomonadales from the subphylum -Proteobacteria. Although many extreme
halophiles are mesophilic or neutrophilic, moderately
thermophilic extreme halophiles have been described,
along with several alkaliphilic extreme halophiles. Microorganisms which have two extreme growth optima are
generally described using the two specific extrema, e.g.,
alkaliphilic halophiles. However, only a very few extreme
halophiles able to grow optimally under alkaline conditions as well as at elevated temperatures have been isolated so far. This review will focus on the pH and
temperature optima of extremely halophilic bacteria, with
a focus on those with alkaline pH optima, above 8.5, and
elevated temperature optima, above 50°C. These microorganisms are considered extremophiles, and, if all three
conditions are required for optimal growth, are termed by
the authors "poly-extremophiles". They are of great interest, as their adaptive mechanisms give insight into the
abilities of bacteria to survive in environments which were
previously considered prohibitive to life, as well as to possible properties of early evolutionary and extraterrestrial
life forms [17]. The purpose of this overview is to discover
whether a correlation exists amongst the validly published
bacterial taxa between the extents of halophily, alkaliphily
and/or thermophily. In other words: is the extent of one
extreme condition limiting the concomitant extent of
other extreme growth condition (e.g., a higher temperature optimum requiring a less alkaline pH or a lower
sodium salt concentration)?
Currently (September 2009), there are over sixty validly
published species (i.e., published or validated in the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology/Systematic and
Evolutionary Microbiology, as listed at http://www.bacte
rio.cict.fr) which are extremely halophilic, according to
the description. Of these species, approximately thirty percent have [Na+] optima of less than 2.0 M (equivalent to
approximately 12% w/v NaCl), nineteen of which are

Page 2 of 8

Saline Systems 2009, 5:9

published at 1.7 M (equivalent to approximately 10% w/
v NaCl). Approximately forty-five percent of the extremely
halophilic species have published [Na+] optima equal to
or greater than 2.0 M but less than 3.4 M, and only thirteen microorganisms (approximately 25%) have published [Na+] optima equal to or greater than 3.4 M
(equivalent to approximately 20% (w/v) NaCl). Additionally, approximately thirty percent of the species tolerate
[Na+] 5.0 M or greater (equivalent to approximately 29%
w/v NaCl). Among these microorganisms, only three-Halorhodospira halochloris, Halanaerobium lacusrosei and the
unpublished Natranaerobius 'grantii'--have been described
which grow in the presence of saturated NaCl (i.e., 5.5 to
6.5 M, since the saturation point is dependent upon
media composition, growth pH and temperature)
[11,13,18]. Clearly, as the [Na+] increases the number of
known microorganisms with the adaptive mechanisms
that enable them to thrive under these conditions
decreases. However, while the number of microorganisms
with [Na+] optima above 3.0 M is small, a significantly
larger number of bacterial halophiles are able to tolerate
3.0 M [Na+]; in fact, all of the extreme halophiles with a
published [Na+] maximum are able to do so [see Additional File 1].

pH optima and ranges of extreme halophiles
Interestingly, out of all the established extremely halophilic bacteria, only nineteen species have pH optima of
8.5 or greater [see Additional File 1], although many salt
lakes and salterns from which these organisms were isolated have alkaline pH values. Of these, only ten species
combine an elevated pH optimum with a [Na+] optimum
of 2.0 M or greater. The distribution of the [Na+] and pH
optima are shown in Figure 1a; clearly, the combinations
of pH optimum 9 with a [Na+] optimum of approximately
1.7 M is the most highly represented, followed by the
combinations of pH optima 7 and 8 with [Na+] optimum
of approximately 1.7 M. Theoretically, if the adaptive
resources of a microorganism are being utilized heavily to
deal with one type of environmental stress (e.g., osmotic
stress) there will be less available resources to deal with
other types of environmental stressors: in this case, the
elevated pH. Microorganisms with pH values for optimal
growth above 8.5 carry with them the usual energetic
problems of alkaliphiles, e.g., an inverted pH gradient and
thus a suboptimal proton motive force [3]. In the case of
extremely halophilic alkaliphiles these problems are exacerbated by the need to keep the intracellular sodium concentration below toxic levels, which is frequently as low as
a few mM [19,20]. This complication may explain the
more prevalent occurrence of microorganisms growing
optimally in environments that are pH neutral or near
neutral. However, it could also be an artifact of the fact
that researchers have investigated the alkaline halobiotic
environments and the biodiversity of their microorgan-

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/5/1/9

isms less than those of neutral or slightly acidic halobiotic
environments. Mesbah et al [21] have shown that the biodiversity of the alkaline athalassohaline lakes of Wadi An
Natrun (North Egypt) is relatively high. Similar observations were made by Ghozlan et. al. regarding saline habitats of Alexandria, Egypt [22] and Duckworth et. al.
regarding various alkaline soda lakes [23]. Obligately
alkaliphilic halophilic bacteria from the lakes of the Wadi
An Natrun include: Natranaerobius thermophilus [2], Natranaerobius trueperi and Natronovirga wadinatrunensis [24].
Each of these microorganisms has a pH55°C optimum of
9.5 or greater as well as a [Na+] optimum greater than 2.5
M. As previously recommended by Wiegel [25], the pH
values for N. thermophilus, N. 'jonesii', N. trueperi, N. wadinatrunensis and N. 'grantii' were measured at each microorganism's optimum growth temperature, denoted with a
superscript (i.e., pH55°C). The pH measurement of an alkaline, complex growth medium which is at an elevated
temperature (i.e., 55°C) with a pH probe calibrated at a
much lower temperature (i.e., 25°C) will yield a pH measurement that can be upwards of one unit greater than that
measured with a pH probe calibrated at the elevated temperature [25]. A number of other species have pH optima
of 8.5-9 or greater, and of these, three species--Halorhodospira halochloris [10,11], Halorhodospira abdelmalekii [11,26]
and Natroniella acetigena [27]--also have [Na+] optima of
greater than 2.5 M, whereas the more-studied Salinibacter
ruber, with a [Na+] optimum around 4 M, grows optimally
at pH 8.0 and does not grow above pH 8.5 [28]. Overall,
the number of anaerobic and aerobic haloalkaliphiles is
similar (there are nine anaerobic and eleven aerobic haloalkaliphiles); interestingly, however, of the group of
organisms just discussed, which have a [Na+] optimum
greater than 2.5 M as well as a pH optima greater than 8.5,
all are obligately anaerobic with a fermentative metabolism.

Elevated temperature optima and ranges of
extreme halophiles
The other environmental stressor of interest is elevated
temperature. Figure 1b contrasts, in similar fashion to Figure 1a, the correlation between temperature optima with
the [Na+] optima of the halophiles under review. Elevated
temperature optima--which is, for true thermophiles,
above 50°C--are even more infrequent amongst the published extremely halophilic eubacteria than are alkaline
pH optima. An additional problem for thermophiles is
that, at the elevated temperature, the cell membrane
becomes more permeable to the diffusion of protons and
to increased Na+ diffusion [29]--especially in saline environments--making it more difficult for the cell to keep the
intracellular [Na+] at a millimolar level against the molar
extracellular concentration of Na+. The increased Na+ permeability is less pronounced than the increased proton
permeability, but is significant in extremely halophilic

conditions. Of the extremely halophilic bacteria with
determined temperature optima, only eight have temperature optima equal to or greater than 50°C. Dichotomicrobium thermohalophilum and Halorhodospira halophila have
published temperature optima of 50°C [30,31], Halonatronum saccharophilum of 55°C [32], Halothermothrix orenii
of 60°C [33], the unpublished Natranaerobius 'jonesii' of
66°C [13], Natranaerobius thermophilus of 53°C [2], Natranaerobius trueperi of 52°C [24], and Natronivirga wadinatrunensis of 51°C [24]. Three others, Salinibacter ruber,
Halorhodospira halochloris and the unpublished Natranaerobius 'grantii', are thermotolerant, and have temperature
optima of 46-48°C, just below the thermophilic designation [see Additional File 1]. Of these two groups of organisms only D. thermohalophilum and S. ruber are aerobes;
the remaining organisms are all obligately anaerobic.
While there are few true thermophilic extreme halophiles,
many species--approximately forty percent of the validly
published halophiles--are able to tolerate temperatures
above 50°C [see Additional File 1]. Most species (60%)
have temperature optima of 40°C or below: twenty-five
percent of these have temperature optima of 38-40°C,
and approximately fifty percent have temperature optima
of 32-37°C. The remaining twenty-five percent have temperature optima between 30 and 32°C. It is important to
note that not all species considered have published temperature optima. Interestingly, no strictly psychrophilic
(Topt ≤ 15°C and Tmax ≤ 20°C) extreme halophiles have
been described to date, though many psychrophiles and
psychrotolerant species, such as Psychrobacter okhotskensis
(Trange 5-35°C, Topt 25°C), tolerate up to 4 M Na+ [34];
however the published [Na+] optima of these microorganisms are below 1.7 M.

Poly-extremophiles: extreme halophiles with
elevated temperature optima and alkaline pH
optima
Of the group of thermophilic extremely halophilic Bacteria, only the anaerobic microorganisms Natranaerobius
thermophilus, Natranaerobius 'jonesii', Natranaerobius
trueperi and Natronovirga wadinatrunensis demonstrate elevated pH optima (9.5-10.5) and [Na+] optima (3.7-3.9
M), a group we term poly-extremophiles. Also of note are
Halorhodospira halochloris which has a slightly lower temperature optimum of 48°C, a pH optimum of 8.5 and a
[Na+] optimum of 4.62 M and Natranaerobius 'grantii'
which has a temperature optimum of 46°C, a pH45°C optimum of 9.5 and [Na+] optimum of 4.3 M [see Additional
File 1]. The uniqueness of these poly-extremophiles when
compared to other known, extremely halophilic Bacteria is
illustrated in Figure 2. On all three axes, [Na+], pH and
temperature, these bacteria fall much farther along the
axis than do other extreme halophiles. The fact that these
microorganisms can not only survive but thrive under
these multiple extreme conditions has extended the

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/5/1/9

known boundaries for life at a combination of multiple
extrema. Microorganisms living in extreme environments
utilize a number of adaptive mechanisms in order to enable them to proliferate, and this is true to an even greater
extent of poly-extremophiles. Cytoplasmic acidification
for pH adaptation under halophilic growth conditions
using multiple monovalent cation/proton antiporters
with various pH ranges [35], the combined use of organic
compatible solutes [36] and intracellular accumulation of
K+ [20] for adaptation to osmotic pressure are three of the
adaptive mechanisms employed by this group of microorganisms [1,3,37].
To date, the only true anaerobic poly-extremophiles have
been isolated from sediment samples taken from one of
two locations. Three of the four anaerobic extremely halophilic alkalithermophiles, N. thermophilus, N trueperi and
N. wadinatrunensis, were isolated from the solar-heated,
alkaline, hypersaline lakes of the Wadi An Natrun, Egypt
(temperatures up to 60°C measured in the salt brine)
[2,24]. The Wadi An Natrun is a series of eight lakes in
northern Egypt noted for their salinity and alkaline pH.
Halorhodospira halochloris, an anaerobic phototrophic purple bacterium, which is a thermotolerant, rather than thermophilic alkaliphilic halophile, was also isolated from
the Wadi An Natrun [11]. N. 'jonesii', and the thermotolerant N. 'grantii', were isolated from sediment samples
from Lake Magadi, in the Kenyan Rift Valley [13]. Lake
Magadi, like the lakes of the Wadi An Natrun, is noted for
its salinity and alkalinity. In places, the temperature of the
lake exceeds 45°C; however, the lake is fed by saline hot
springs in addition to being heated by sun rays.
The question remains: do the physiological and bioenergetic demands of dealing with one extreme condition
(e.g., elevated temperature) limit an organisms' ability to
meet the demands of two additional extreme conditions
(e.g., elevated pH and high sodium concentrations) or
reduce the extent of the other extrema to lower levels? A
first look at the distribution of the peaks in Figure 2 suggests that yes, amongst the presented microorganisms, the
more extreme the optimum is for one condition, the less
extreme the optima for other conditions tend to be. However, the recent isolation and cultivation of the anaerobic
poly-extremophiles in the novel order Natranaerobiales,
which grow with doubling times around 3-4 h [2,13,24]
and which require elevated temperatures, alkaline pH and
high [Na+] in order to survive, demonstrate that microorganisms can thrive under combinations of multiple
extrema. Furthermore, there is a notion that aerobic extremophiles, with higher ATP yields via electron transport
phosphorylation should be better suited to extreme conditions than are anaerobic fermentative extremophiles,
which have significantly lower ATP yields per substrate
utilized, but so far there are no validly published aerobic

Bacteria with similar combinations of growth conditions
such as those of the anaerobic Natranaerobius species. The
point needs to be stressed that with further investigation
into alkaline halobiotic environments more, possibly
many more, bacterial poly-extremophiles will be isolated
and identified. As noted by Foti et al. (2008), few species
identified from hypersaline habitats via culture independent methods are closely related to validly described species. Additionally, in the study performed by Foti et al.
(2008) on Russian soda lakes, none of the validly
described species were defined as haloalkaliphilic or haloalkalitolerant [38]; however, other studies on Kenyan and
Egyptian soda lakes have identified uncultured clones
related to validly described haloalkaliphiles [21,39].
While the utility of culture independent methods cannot

be disputed, the presence of a microorganism in an environment does not necessarily imply that the particular
environment under investigation represents the optimal
environment for the growth of the microorganism. The
only way to learn the true ranges and optimum growth
conditions for a particular species is to characterize the
cultured species, therefore limiting our discussion to validly published microorganisms. Although nearly every
month novel halophiles are published in the International
Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology the
majority of them are Archaea, or grow only at slightly elevated salt concentration, and are not bacterial extreme
halophiles. The authors predict that when investigators
focus more on isolating extreme halophiles, and especially poly-extremophilic halophiles, from extreme habi-

tats the present list will be significantly extended, and the
present limits of combined alkaline pH, elevated temperature and [Na+] could be pushed to more extreme values.
Then the questions arise: what are the final boundaries?
Does a super bacterium exist which can grow at the presently known limit of alkalinity, around pH 12 (or conversely, at acidity of around pH 1); at the present limit of
temperature, around 121°C (or conversely, at temperatures below -12°C); as well as at saturated [Na+]? Thus far,
no single aerobic or anaerobic bacterial or archaeal isolate
has been found with optima even near these levels; however, this lack of knowledge certainly does not rule out the
existence of such a microorganism. The authors hope that
this overview will stimulate further investigation and isolations of these intriguing poly-extremophilic bacterial
halophiles and elucidation of their unique physiological
and biochemical properties for biotechnological applications.
