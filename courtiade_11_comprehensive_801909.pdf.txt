A comprehensive characterization of the caspase
gene family in insects from the order Lepidoptera
Juliette Courtiade, Yannick Pauchet*, Heiko Vogel and David G Heckel

Abstract
Background: The cell suicide pathway of apoptosis is a necessary event in the life of multicellular organisms. It is
involved in many biological processes ranging from development to the immune response. Evolutionarily
conserved proteases, called caspases, play a central role in regulating apoptosis. Reception of death stimuli triggers
the activation of initiator caspases, which in turn activate the effector caspases. In Lepidoptera, apoptosis is crucial
in processes such as metamorphosis or defending against baculovirus infection. The discovery of p35, a baculovirus
protein inhibiting caspase activity, has led to the characterization of the first lepidopteran caspase, Sf-Caspase-1.
Studies on Sf-Caspase-1 mode of activation suggested that apoptosis in Lepidoptera requires a cascade of caspase
activation, as demonstrated in many other species.
Results: In order to get insights into this gene family in Lepidoptera, we performed an extensive survey of
lepidopteran-derived EST datasets. We identified 66 sequences distributed among 27 species encoding putative
caspases. Phylogenetic analyses showed that Lepidoptera possess at least 5 caspases, for which we propose a
unified nomenclature. According to homology to their Drosophila counterparts and their primary structure, we
determined that Lep-Caspase-1, -2 and -3 are putative effector caspases, whereas Lep-Caspase-5 and -6 are
putative initiators. The likely function of Lep-Caspase-4 remains unclear. Lep-Caspase-2 is absent from the silkworm
genome and appears to be noctuid-specific, and to have arisen from a tandem duplication of the Caspase-1 gene.
In the tobacco hawkmoth, 3 distinct transcripts encoding putative Caspase-4 were identified, suggesting at least 2
duplication events in this species.
Conclusions: The basic repertoire of five major types of caspases shared among Lepidoptera seems to be smaller
than for most other groups studied to date, but gene duplication still plays a role in lineage-specific increases in
diversity, just as in Diptera and mammals.

Background
Apoptosis, a distinctive and highly regulated type of cell
suicide, is fundamental for various biological processes
such as development [1], tissue homeostasis, DNA damage
response [2] and immune response [3]. Development of
holometabolous insects is characterized by a complete
metamorphosis between the wingless larval stage, mostly
dedicated to nutrient acquisition and growth, and the
winged adult form, dedicated to reproduction. These drastic modifications in appearance and physiology require
massive histolysis and histogenesis. The importance of
apoptotic events during development of holometabolous
insects and more specifically in Lepidoptera has been

shown as early as the 1960’s. In wild silkmoths and the
tobacco hawkmoth, the first ecdysone peak during metamorphosis induces apoptotic degeneration of the larval
intersegmental muscles, proleg motoneurons, and labial
glands [4-6]. The decrease in ecdysone titer shortly before
hatching induces apoptotic degeneration of abdominal
neurons and intersegmental muscles [7]. Important
changes in food habits between larval and adult stages
imply extensive remodeling of the digestive tract. For
example, in Galleria mellonella, the larval midgut undergoes apoptosis during metamorphosis [8]. Similarly, in
Heliothis virescens, apoptosis of the larval midgut has been
correlated with higher caspase expression shortly before
and after pupation [9]. Among the different protective
measures triggered by the insect immune system to thwart
pathogen infection, host cell suicide through apoptosis can

significantly reduce viral replication, dissemination and
infectivity [10].
A major family of evolutionarily conserved cysteinedependent aspartate-specific proteases, called caspases,
plays a central role in apoptosis. Studies on alpha-proteobacteria, closely related species of the free-living ancestor
of mitochondria, revealed the presence of genes similar to
caspases, suggesting that ancestor of eukaryotic caspases
derived from mitochondrial endosymbionts [11]. Ancestors of caspase genes then evolved into ‘metacaspases’ in
plants and fungi, ‘paracaspases’ in slime, molds and animals and in ‘true caspases’ in animals. The number of
“true” caspase genes differs greatly among animal lineages
with as little as 4 genes in Caenorhabditis elegans [12], 5
in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, 7 in the fruit
fly Drosophila melanogaster [13], 10 and 11 in the mosquitoes Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti respectively
[14], 12 in human [15,16], to up to 31 in the sea urchin
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus [17]. It has been hypothesized that the host-pathogen interaction has been one of
the major evolutionary forces shaping the apoptotic
machinery and therefore the caspase repertoire [17,18].
The caspase family is divided into two groups: the
inflammatory caspases and the apoptotic caspases composed of the initiator and the effector subgroups. To date,
dedicated inflammatory caspases seem to be restricted to
mammals. Although a non-apoptotic role of some lepidopteran caspases should not be excluded at this stage,
the description of inflammatory caspases will not be considered further here. Apoptotic caspases are synthesized in
the cell as catalytically inactive forms. All members of the
caspase family share a canonical structure consisting of a
prodomain and a catalytic domain named “peptidase C14”
(Caspase domain pfam PF00656). The catalytic domain is
formed by 2 subunits, a large one of about 20 kDa, also
known as p20, and a small one of about 10 kDa, also
referred as p10. Upon proteolytic processing of the proenzyme, the two subunits form a heterodimer and the active
caspase enzyme is made of the association of two of these
heterodimers. The enzymatic activity of caspases shows
strong cleavage site specificity towards a four amino-acid
motif ending with an aspartate residue [19-21]. In contrast
to the catalytic domain, which is structurally conserved,
the prodomain varies significantly among caspases. The
characteristic binding sites (L/ST/SHG) and active sites
(Q A / R C R / Q G) are conserved in all caspases except in
D. melanogaster Dronc [22]. Whereas effector caspases
have a short prodomain of about 30 amino acids, initiator
caspases have a prodomain of 80 or more amino acids
[23]. Long prodomains usually harbor structures belonging
to the Death Domain superfamily, such as Death Effector
Domain (DED) or Caspase Recruitment Domain (CARD),
which are involved in the recruitment and subsequent

activation of initiator caspases by death receptors or by
the apoptosome [24].
In the pro-apoptotic proteolytic cascade, initiator caspases are activated first, and these in turn activate the
effector caspases. The latter are responsible for the cleavage of many cellular components [25], leading to the
characteristic features of apoptotic cells such as DNA fragmentation and membrane blebbing [26]. In mammals, in
the extrinsic pathway, the binding of a “death” ligand to its
receptor changes the receptor conformation, allowing the
recruitment of an adaptor protein such as FADD and of
initiator Caspase-8. The formation of this complex leads
to the autoactivation of Caspase-8 (Figure 1). The intrinsic
pathway is activated in response to intracellular signals
which induce a permeabilization of the mitochondria
outer membrane, allowing the release in the cytosol of several proteins such as Smac/Diablo and Cytochrome c.
Cytochrome c forms a protein complex with Apaf 1 called
the apoptosome, which recruits the initiator Caspase-9
leading to its subsequent activation. Caspase-8 and -9 are
both able to activate the effector caspase-3, -6 and -7
(Figure 1). In Drosophila, there is no evidence of an extrinsic pathway, and the formation of the apoptosome with
Dark, the homolog of Apaf 1, and Dronc, the homolog of
Caspase-9, does not require Cytochrome c [27]. Dronc
then activates the effector caspase DrICE. Homologs of
the core components of the apoptosis machinery found in
Drosophila have also been described in mosquitoes, suggesting that apoptosis is regulated in a similar fashion in
mosquitoes [14].
In Lepidoptera, very little is known about apoptotic
molecular pathways (Figure 1). The discovery in the early
1990’s of p35, a baculovirus pan-caspase inhibitor [28],
has led to the characterization of the first lepidopteran
caspase, Sf-caspase-1, from the Sf9 cell line derived from
the noctuid moth Spodoptera frugiperda [29]. Later, the
likely orthologs from S. littoralis [30], Helicoverpa armigera [31] and Trichoplusia ni [32] were also characterized. Members of this caspase-1 group have been shown
to act as effector caspases, but so far no other classes of
caspases have been described in Lepidoptera. The existence of an “apical” caspase responsible for the activation
of Sf-caspase-1 has been suggested [33]. Furthermore, 2
other baculovirus proteins, p49 and IAP [34,35] have
been shown to inhibit apoptosis in Sf9 cells by blocking
the processing of Sf-caspase-1, suggesting that the likely
target of these 2 inhibitors may be an apical caspase, tentatively named Sf-caspase X. So far, this caspase X has
not been characterized, but these results suggest that, in
Lepidoptera, apoptosis requires a cascade of caspase activation, similar to other organisms.
In an attempt to characterize the caspase gene family
in lepidopteran insects, we first surveyed the recently

sequenced genome of the silkworm Bombyx mori [36],
as well as publicly available and ‘in-house’ EST datasets.
From these, we retrieved 66 transcripts encoding putative caspases from 27 species of butterflies and moths.
Phylogenetic analyses showed that these genes clustered
into 6 distinct clades (Caspase-1 to -6), three of which
are classified as putative effector caspases, two corresponding to putative initiator caspases and one that
could not be readily classified as either. We propose a
naming convention for these genes based on our phylogenetic analyses. Finally, we discovered that one of the
caspase subfamilies (caspase-2) is absent from the genome of the silkworm, has evolved from a tandem gene
duplication of caspase-1, is under purifying selection
which however is more relaxed than for caspase-1, and
is likely to be restricted to species of the family
Noctuidae.

Results and discussion
Lepidopteran caspases cluster into six distinct clades

As the genome of the silkworm Bombyx mori is the sole
fully sequenced genome for insects of the order Lepidoptera to date, we first searched it for the presence of putative caspase genes (Figure 2). We identified a total of 5
genes, one on chromosome 4 (Caspase-3), three at various
places on chromosome 10 (Caspase-1, -5 and -6) and one
on chromosome 20 (Caspase-4) (Figure 2). Our findings
are in agreement with a genome-wide analysis of the Bombyx mori genome for apoptosis-related genes, in which
these 5 caspase genes have also been identified [37]. To
get further insight into this gene family, we then mined
publicly available as well as “in-house” EST datasets
for transcripts encoding putative caspase enzymes. We
retrieved a total of 66 transcripts corresponding to 63 different genes, from 27 species of moths and butterflies

Classification of the lepidopteran caspases

spanning 11 lepidopteran families (Additional file 1). Caspase sequences were accepted if they fulfilled the following
criteria: presence of the characteristic binding site (L/ST/S
H G) and/or active site (QACR/QG), and level of amino
acid identity (for complete amino acid alignments, see
Additional files 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7). A Bayesian inferred
phylogenetic analysis clustered these sequences into six
distinct clades (Figure 3), revealing an extra caspase gene
family that was not found in the B. mori genome (Caspase-2). This observed number of caspase genes in Lepidoptera is similar to the seven genes found in Drosophila
species: Drice, Dcp-1, Decay, Damm, Dronc, Dredd and
Strica (also known as Dream) [13].
To facilitate our analysis at this stage, we decided to
establish a naming convention for these genes based on
the results of the phylogenetic analyses. The first caspase
fully characterized for a lepidopteran insect has been
named Caspase-1 preceded by the initials Sf, corresponding to the name of the species Spodoptera frugiperda
[29]. We extended this convention by naming each caspase starting with the initials of the species from which it
has been isolated, followed by “-Caspase” and by a number depending on which clade the sequence clustered
into. Clades were arbitrarily numbered Caspase-1 to Caspase-6. The term “Lep” was added to the cluster name to
differentiate lepidopteran caspases from sequences
derived from other organisms. When splicing variants
were found (see below), we used the nomenclature proposed by Alnemri et al in which each variant is identified
by a letter [38]. Here we stress the point that our nomenclature does not reflect any orthology between lepidopteran caspases and mammalian ones. For example,
Lep-Caspase-2 is not an ortholog of Human caspase-2.

The phylogenetic analysis clustered Lep-Caspase-1, -2
and -3 with Dcp-1, Drice and Decay (Figure 3). These 3
Drosophila caspases have been classified as effectors due
to their short prodomain, their substrate specificity
toward the tetrapeptide DEVD and their ability to cleave
the Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and/or p35 [39-42].
Lep-Caspase-1 and -3 also harbor a short prodomain,
characteristic of effector caspases (Figure 4). However, no
suitable cleavage site between the prodomain and the
large subunit could be found in Lep-Caspase-2, and an
amino acid alignment of Lep-Caspase-1 and -2 sequences
suggests that the latter lacks a prodomain (Additional
file 8). Caspase-1 has already been characterized in
S. frugiperda and S. littoralis. These studies demonstrated
substrate specificity toward DEVD [30] and the ability to
cleave p35 similar to the Drosophila effector caspases
[29]. Although Drice and Dcp-1 are highly similar in
sequence, several studies have shown that Drice and not
Dcp-1 is the main effector caspase in Drosophila [41,43].
A study comparing the effect of single and double
mutants for Drice and Dcp-1 showed that these two caspases have an overlapping function [44]. The role of
Decay has still to be clarified. Finally, based on another
phylogenetic analysis including all the known mosquito
caspase sequences [45], we find no clear orthology
between lepidopteran and dipteran effector caspases,
which is due to the rapid evolution and diversity of this
gene family (Additional file 9).
Like the Drosophila Dronc, to which it is closely
related, and human Caspase-9, Lep-Caspase-5 harbors a
CARD domain within its long prodomain (Figure 4).
Typical CARD domains are constituted by a bundle of 6
alpha helices. An amino acid alignment of the prodomain
of CARD containing caspases, including B. mori caspase5, shows a low amino acid conservation, but a high conservation of the position of the 6 alpha helices (additional
file 10). CARD domains are involved in the interaction of
initiator caspases with Ark/Apaf1, to form the apoptosome which is required for the activation of Dronc/
human Caspase-9 [46,47]. It has been shown that dronc
is ubiquitously expressed during the development of Drosophila and that its expression is stimulated by ecdysone
during metamorphosis [22]. Lep-Caspase-6 is closely
related to Drosophila Dredd. The presence, in the long
prodomain, of 2 motifs composed of 6 alpha helices,
forming a three-dimensional structure characteristic of
the Death Domain family (Figure 4), strongly supports its
classification as an initiator caspase [24]. An amino acid
alignment of B. mori caspase-6 with other Death
Domain-containing caspases from human and Diptera
shows again a low amino acid conservation, but the position of the alpha helices is conserved (Additional file 11).
Despite the first description of Dredd as a potential

Amino acid alignments of caspase sequences without their prodomain were used to build a phylogenetic tree using a Bayesian inferred
method with the C. elegans caspase Ced3 as an outgroup. Lepidopteran caspase clades were determined by branching patterns and are

initiator caspase [48], it now appears to be more important in activating the innate immune response upon
infection by Gram negative bacteria [49]. Based on a
phylogenetic analysis including all the known mosquito
caspase sequences, it is clear that Lep-Caspase-5 and
Lep-Caspase-6 are the orthologs of dipteran Dronc and
Dredd, respectively (Additional file 9).

Despite a relatively long prodomain, Lep-Caspase-4
does not harbor any known Death Domain which would
have supported its classification as an initiator caspase
(Figure 4). The phylogenetic analyses show a relationship with the Drosophila caspases Damm and Strica, for
which the function has not been clearly defined yet.
Lepidopteran Caspase-4 sequences share about 20%

amino acid identity with Strica/Damm homologs from
flies and mosquitoes, but do not harbor any serinethreonine-rich regions in the prodomain [50]. Although
Damm and Strica are very similar in sequence, they
appear to play different roles in D. melanogaster: Damm
seems to be an effector caspase [51], whereas Strica
seems to be an initiator caspase, exhibiting redundant
activity with Dronc during oogenesis based on genetic
studies [52]. Within the 12 sequenced Drosophila species, Damm is a more recent duplication of the ancestral
Strica, as Damm is restricted to the melanogaster and
obscura groups [45]. Perhaps the ancestral Strica was an
initiator caspase in Diptera. Another unusual feature of
Lep-Caspase-4 is its unique small subunit. It is twice as
long as any other small subunit described so far, which
usually ends 60 to 80 amino acids after the conserved
serine residue (Ser 428 ) involved in substrate binding
(Additional files 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7). In addition, alignments (Additional file 5) show that the sequence corresponding to the last 140 residues of the small subunit is
more variable compared to the rest of the subunit. However some residues are conserved in all sequences,
including 3 cysteine residues potentially involved in the
formation of secondary structures. These features indicate that Lep-Caspase-4 is a peculiar caspase, the function of which cannot be solely assessed by sequence
comparisons.

short form still possesses an intact prodomain and small
subunit. In human, Caspase-9 splicing variants have
been identified. In one of them, Caspase-9S, the catalytic
site is missing and this isoform has been shown to be a
dominant-negative inhibitor of apoptosis, by blocking
the Caspase-9/Apaf1 interaction [53]. Enzymatically
inactive caspase homologs that have arisen by gene
duplication events have been recently described in Diptera [45]. These caspase-like decoy molecules may have
acquired the ability to regulate other caspases. The
short form of Bm-caspase-5 might have evolved a similar decoy function by alternate splicing, however we
could not find any separate genes encoding caspase-like
decoy molecules in our analyses. Although several isoforms of Caspase-5 were observed in B. mori, only a single transcript could be detected in H. armigera. In
addition, the sequences corresponding to exon 6 and 7
in B. mori are part of a single exon in H. armigera, so a
product like B. mori Caspase-5b could not be produced
by alternate splicing in the latter species.
Three splicing variants were detected for Bm-Caspase-3
(Additional files 4 and 12), all of them harboring both catalytic and binding sites. Alternative splicing was not
observed for Ha-Caspase-3. It has been suggested that catalytically active isoforms may differ in specificity and efficiency, which could fine-tune caspase activity through
hetero-dimerization, resulting in amplification or inhibition of apoptosis [54].

Alternative splicing of Caspase-3 and -5 in B. mori

In B. mori, two isoforms of Caspase-5 have been identified, a long form (-5/a) and a short form (-5/b) in which
the exon encoding the sequence corresponding to the
catalytic site is spliced out (See Additional file 12 for the
intron-exon structure of lepidopteran caspases). The

A noctuid-specific caspase gene arose from duplication of
caspase-1

Thorough mining of lepidopteran EST datasets for putative Caspase-2 led us to find the corresponding genes only
in species of the family Noctuidae (Figure 3 and

Courtiade et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:357
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/357

Additional file 1). No ortholog of Caspase-2 could be
found in the silkworm genome (Figure 2). Taking into
account that the amino acid identity between Lep-Caspase-1 and Lep-Caspase-2 sequences is relatively high
(ranging between 47 and 53%), we hypothesized that both
genes may have arisen, in Noctuidae, from a tandem gene
duplication event. To test this hypothesis, we screened a
H. armigera BAC library using probes designed according
to either the Ha-Caspase-1 or the Ha-Caspase-2 sequence.
A BAC clone (clone P3E13, Genbank accession
HQ645847) hit by both probes was identified and selected
for sequencing. The Caspase-1 and -2 genes were found,
in a 43 kb fragment of this BAC, to be organized in tandem, separated by only 3 kb of non-coding DNA, were
in the same orientation (Figure 5) and had no intron
(Additional file 12), confirming our hypothesis. We then
compared the organization of the genes surrounding Caspase-1 between H. armigera and B. mori (Figure 5), we
found a high degree of micro-synteny in this region of the
genome between the two species, similar to what has been
reported in recent studies [55,56].
To examine the relative rates of sequence evolution
within the Caspase-1 and -2 subfamilies since divergence,
pairwise comparisons of sequences obtained from noctuid
species were performed by applying the Nei-Gojobori
algorithm [57] (see Additional file 13 for the P-distances
of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions). Mean
of synonymous substitutions per site (dS) was 0.480 and
0.549 within Caspase-1 and Caspase-2 respectively; mean
dS between Caspase-1 and -2 is 0.646, indicating saturation. Mean non-synonymous substitutions per site (dN)
was 0.047 for Caspase-1 and 0.170 for Caspase-2. We used
the Codon-based Z-test [58] to test the null hypothesis dS
= dN which would indicate that both genes are neutrally
evolving. We could reject this null hypothesis as we found
that dN is significantly smaller than dS (Caspase-1: Z =
-17.000, p < 0.001; Caspase-2: Z = -14.138, p < 0.001),

Page 7 of 12

indicating a strong purifying selection on both genes. We
also tested whether synonymous and non-synonymous
substitution rates differ between the two genes (dSCasp1 =
dSCasp2and dNCasp1 = dNCasp2, same Z-test as before) we
could not reject that dSCasp1 = dSCasp2(Z = -2.03, p > 0.05),
but the non-synonymous substitution rate in Caspase-2
was significantly higher compared to the one in Caspase-1
(Z = -8.853, p < 0.001). The coefficient of functional divergence [59], which measures the overall difference between
site-specific substitutions among the two subfamilies is θ =
0.57, which is significantly greater than zero (likelihood
ratio test, c2 = 7.31, P < 0.01). These results strongly suggest that Caspase-2, though also under purifying selection
following the duplication event, has evolved under much
more relaxed selective constraints than Caspase-1. It has
been well documented that gene duplication is often followed by a period of relaxed selective constraints on one
of the duplicate, allowing it to accumulate more mutations
[60,61]. Although it has been suggested that gene duplication occurs at a high rate of 0.01/gene/million years, the
most common fate of duplicated genes is silencing and
loss [62]. In some cases however, the duplicate is retained
as functional gene and either a new function is acquired
by one of the copies or the ancestral function is maintained or subdivided between the two copies [63]. The fact
that the cleavage site differ between the two subunits
(TETD for Caspase-1 and xETD for Caspase-2), and that
Caspase-2 may lack a prodomain, suggests that they might
be activated by different signals. This could indicate a subfunctionalization of Caspase-2 in Noctuidae.
Ms-Caspase-4 subfamily has evolved through duplication
events

Several contigs corresponding to putative Caspase-4 transcripts were identified from an EST dataset derived from
a M. sexta larval midgut cDNA library, sequenced by 454
pyrosequencing [64]. Analyses of complete sequences

obtained by RACE-PCR resulted in 3 distinct cDNAs.
Two of them, Ms-Caspase-4-1/a and -4-1/b, differ only
by 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 8 of
which are non-synonymous, as well as an extra codon
encoding ASN113 in Ms-Caspase-4-1/b (Figure 6A). The
third sequence, Ms-Caspase-4-2, encodes a protein sharing ~63% amino acid identity with both Ms-Caspase-4-1/
a and -4-1/b (Figure 6A). The occurrence of several
unique transcripts for Lep-Caspase-4 has only been
found in that species so far. A closer look at the region
where Bm-Caspase-4 is located on the silkworm genome

Page 8 of 12

did not reveal any extra Lep-caspase-4 genes or even
pseudogenes nearby Bm-Caspase-4 (Figure 6B). These
results suggest that Caspase-4 has undergone at least two
duplication events in M. sexta. A phylogenetic study of
dipteran caspases suggest that Damm and Strica, the
homologs of Lep-Caspase-4, have arisen by duplication
in the melanogaster and obscura clades, while only Strica
is present in the other drosophilid clades [45]. In mosquitoes, the ancestor of Damm/Strica has undergone many
duplication events after the divergence of the Anopheles
gambiae, Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti

lineages. Two homologs of Damm/Strica have been
described in A. gambiae, as well as 2 in C. quinquefasciatus and 4 in A. aegypti [14,45]. All of the duplicates are
potentially active since they all harbor the critical amino
acids involved in binding and active sites. However, no
biochemical characterization has been carried out on
these caspases so far. The paucity of EST data for members of the family Sphingidae does not allow us to conclude whether the duplication of Lep-Caspase-4 is
specific only to M. sexta or if it has also happened in sister species.

Conclusions
Despite obvious limitations of EST datasets in term of
available species and transcriptome coverage, we were able
to identify 63 caspase genes coming from 27 different lepidopteran species. Based on the phylogenetic analyses, we
showed that the lepidopteran caspase family is represented
by at least 5 members. Nevertheless, the biochemical characterization of these caspases has to be performed to clarify the exact function and their potential interactions. The
main shaping forces of the caspase gene family in mammals as well as in other insects, such as mosquitoes, are
gene deletions and gene innovations by duplication events
[16,45]. Although we cannot assess whether deletions of
caspase genes has happened in Lepidoptera, our data suggest that gene duplication is one of the shaping forces of
this gene family in these insects. Availability in the near
future of whole genome sequences and transcriptomes
from other species of the order Lepidoptera as well as
from other insect orders, will improve our understanding
of the complexity of this gene family and its evolutionary
history in insects in general.
Methods
Preparation of cDNA libraries and EST sequencing

Generation of cDNA libraries for T. ni whole larvae [65];
Plutella xylostella, Pieris rapae, Colias eurytheme and
Anthocharis cardamines whole larvae [66]; and for
H. armigera midgut and S. littoralis whole larvae [55]
were previously described. TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen)
was used to isolate total RNA from whole larvae or dissected larval tissues of Pontia daplidice, Eucheira socialis,
Lymantria dispar, Lymantria monacha, G. mellonella,
H. virescens, Mamestra brassicae, and Spodoptera exigua.
Normalized, full-length, enriched cDNA libraries were
generated using both the Creator SMART cDNA library
construction kit (BD Clontech) and the Trimmer Direct
cDNA normalization kit (Evrogen), generally following
the manufacturer’s protocol but with several important
modifications. In brief, 2 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA was used
for each cDNA library generated. Reverse transcription
was performed with a mix of several reverse transcriptases for 1 h at 42°C and 90 minutes at 50°C. cDNA size

fractionation was performed with SizeSep 400 spun
columns (GE Healthcare) that resulted in a cutoff at
~200 bp. The full-length, enriched cDNAs were cut with
SfiI and ligated to the SfiI-digested pDNR-Lib plasmid
vector (Clontech). Ligations were transformed into E. coli
ELECTROMAX DH5a-E electro-competent cells (Invitrogen). Plasmids from bacterial colonies grown in 96
deep-well plates were prepared using the Robot 96 Plasmid isolation kit (Eppendorf) on a Tecan Evo Freedom
150 robotic platform (Tecan). Single-pass sequencing of
the 5’ termini of cDNA libraries was carried out on an
ABI 3730 xl Automatic DNA Sequencer (PE Applied
Biosystems). Vector clipping, quality trimming, and
sequence assembly were done with the Lasergene 8 software package (DNAStar Inc.). BLAST searches were conducted on a local server using the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) blastall program.
Sequences were aligned using ClustalW software [67].
Database mining for putative caspase sequences

The protein sequence of Sf-Caspase-1 (AF548387) [29]
was used as a query to perform TBLASTN searches of
lepidopteran EST databases publicly available on NCBI
dbEST, on InsectaCentral [68,69], or in-house (Additional
file 1). Sequences were accepted as being “caspases” when
presenting the characteristic binding site (L/S T/S H G)
and/or active site (QAC R / Q G). Some exceptions were
made when partial amino acid sequences presented a
strong amino acid identity with sequences previously
accepted as caspases.
Caspase genes amplification and sequencing

Specific primers (Additional file 14) were designed in
order to re-amplify BmCasp-4, and -5, as well as HaCasp1, -2, -3 and -4 using total RNA prepared respectively
from B. mori and H. armigera whole larvae as starting
material. In order to get full length cDNA, 5’-and 3’-RACE
were performed for HaCasp-5, and -6, BmCasp-4,
MsCasp-1, -4-2 and -6 as well as EaCasp-1 and -3 using
the SMART® RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech),
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA
from H. virescens, H. subflexa and H. armigera larvae was
extracted using TRIzol, according to the manufacturer’s
specifications. Forward and reverse specific primers
designed according to the HvCasp-6 sequence (Additional
file 14) were used to amplify HaCasp-6 from H. armigera
cDNAs. Forward and reverse specific primers designed
according to the HaCasp-1 and -2 sequences (Additional
file 14) were used to amplify Casp-1 and -2 from H. virescens and H. subflexa cDNAs. Finally, a H. armigera draft
genome assembly generated by 454 pyrosequencing
(unpublished data) was searched using BmCasp-5 as query
to identify a homolog in H. armigera. Forward and reverse
primers (Additional file 14) were designed based on the

Courtiade et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:357
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/357

sequences of contigs 28382 and 105066 in order to amplify
HaCasp-5 sequence from cDNAs extracted from H. armigera HaAM1 cells [70] treated with 75 μM ecdysone. All
amplicons were then ligated in pCR2.1-Topo ® vector
(Invitrogen). Ligations were transformed into E. coli
TOP10 chemically competent cells (Invitrogen) and plasmid mini-preparation and sequencing were performed as
mentioned above.
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis

Deduced amino acid sequences from caspase transcripts
retrieved from the various databases searched were aligned
together with the Drosophila caspases (Drice, Dcp-1,
Decay, Dronc, Dredd, Damm and Strica) and with the C.
elegans caspase Ced3 as an outgroup, using the FFT-Ns-i
strategy implemented in the MAFFT alignment program
[71]. After removing the prodomain, the amino acid alignment was then used for the phylogenetic analyses. Only
sequences containing the complete open reading frame
(ORF) or partial sequences containing at least the part
encoding the complete large and small subunits were used
to build the phylogenies. The phylogenetic reconstruction
was done by Bayesian inference using MrBayes 3.1 [72].
The prior was set for the amino acid model to mix,
thereby allowing model jumping between fixed-rate amino
acid models. Markov Chain Monte Carlo runs were carried out for 10,000,000 generations after which log likelihood values showed that equilibrium had been reached
after the first 400 generations in all cases, and those data
were discarded from each run and considered as ‘burnin’.
Two runs were conducted for the dataset showing agreement in topology and likelihood. To determine which
clusters partial caspase sequences belong to, amino acid
sequences were aligned with MAFFT using the FFT-Ns-i
strategy; and a phylogenetic tree was generated by Neighbor joining (1000 replicates) using MEGA4 software [73].
Relative-rate tests were applied to compare rates of evolution in the Caspase-1 and Caspase-2 subfamilies. Synonymous and non synonymous substitution rates were
determined by the Nei and Gojobori algorithms [57] as
implemented in MEGA4. Statistics were performed using
the Codon-based Z-test, which corresponds to a t-test
with an infinite degree of freedom [74]. The coefficient of
functional divergence θ was calculated using the program
DIVERGE 2.0 [75]. This coefficient ranges between 0 and
1 and measures the overall degree to which site-specific
substitution rates differ; values significantly greater than
zero indicate rate differences among homologous sites in
the two subfamilies. In order to characterize the primary
structure and domain architecture of the different caspases, their predicted amino acid sequences were submitted to ExPASy ScanProsite [76]. For comparison to
dipteran caspases, sequences from D. melanogaster, Culex

Page 10 of 12

quinquefasciatus, Anopheles gambiae, and Aedes aegypti
were extracted from Supplementary Figure S1 of ref [45].
BAC library screening and sequencing

Nylon filters from a Helicoverpa armigera BAC library
established from the strain Toowoomba were washed,
blocked, and hybridized with horseradish peroxidaselabelled DNA fragment containing part of the H. armigera Casp-1 and Casp-2 genes. Labeling, hybridization,
and probe detection were done according to specifications in the ECL DNA labeling and detection kit (GE
Healthcare). Positive clones were isolated from glycerol
stocks, grown in Terrific Broth, and BAC DNA was isolated with the Nucleobond Xtra Maxi Kit according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Macherey-Nagel). BAC
genomic DNA quantities were estimated spectrophotometrically on a Nanodrop ND 1000 (Peqlab biotechnologie GmbH). Positive clones were digested by EcoR1
and HindIII, blotted and re-hybridized first with HaCaspase-1 probe then with Ha-Caspase-2 to identify
positives clones for the 2 probes. BAC DNA was
sheared into two different size ranges (1.5 -2 kb and 4-5
kb) with a hydroshear device (Molecular devices),
blunted with the Quick blunting kit (New England Biolabs), isolated from agarose gel, column purified, and
ligated into the pUC19-SmaI vector (Fermentas). Ligations were transformed into E. coli ELECTROMAX
DH5a-E electrocompetent cells (Invitrogen). Plasmid
preparation, sequencing, and assembly were performed
as mentioned above.
Intron-Exon structure

Bombyx mori caspase cDNA sequences were compared to
the genomic sequences retrieved from KAIKObase [77,78]
(Caspase-1: BGIBMGA006940, Caspase-3: BGIBMGA
006131, Caspase-4: BGIBMGA004420, Caspase-5:
BGIBMGA002841, Caspase-6: BGIBMGA006726) using
the Spidey software available at NCBI. The same comparison was done using H. armigera cDNA sequences and the
genomic sequences retrieved from the H. armigera draft
genome assembly mentioned above.
