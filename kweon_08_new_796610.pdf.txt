Abstract
Background: Rieske non-heme iron aromatic ring-hydroxylating oxygenases (RHOs) are multi-component enzyme systems
that are remarkably diverse in bacteria isolated from diverse habitats. Since the first classification in 1990, there has been a need
to devise a new classification scheme for these enzymes because many RHOs have been discovered, which do not belong to any
group in the previous classification. Here, we present a scheme for classification of RHOs reflecting new sequence information
and interactions between RHO enzyme components.
Result: We have analyzed a total of 130 RHO enzymes in which 25 well-characterized RHO enzymes were used as standards
to test our hypothesis for the proposed classification system. From the sequence analysis of electron transport chain (ETC)
components of the standard RHOs, we extracted classification keys that reflect not only the phylogenetic affiliation within each
component but also relationship among components. Oxygenase components of standard RHOs were phylogenetically classified
into 10 groups with the classification keys derived from ETC components. This phylogenetic classification scheme was converted
to a new systematic classification consisting of 5 distinct types. The new classification system was statistically examined to justify
its stability. Type I represents two-component RHO systems that consist of an oxygenase and an FNRC-type reductase. Type II
contains other two-component RHO systems that consist of an oxygenase and an FNRN-type reductase. Type III represents a
group of three-component RHO systems that consist of an oxygenase, a [2Fe-2S]-type ferredoxin and an FNRN-type reductase.
Type IV represents another three-component systems that consist of oxygenase, [2Fe-2S]-type ferredoxin and GR-type
reductase. Type V represents another different three-component systems that consist of an oxygenase, a [3Fe-4S]-type
ferredoxin and a GR-type reductase.
Conclusion: The new classification system provides the following features. First, the new classification system analyzes RHO
enzymes as a whole. RwithSecond, the new classification system is not static but responds dynamically to the growing pool of
RHO enzymes. Third, our classification can be applied reliably to the classification of incomplete RHOs. Fourth, the classification
has direct applicability to experimental work. Fifth, the system provides new insights into the evolution of RHO systems based
on enzyme interaction.

Background
Microorganisms play indispensable roles in the degradation and detoxification of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the environment [1,2]. The initiation of
the aerobic microbial degradation of PAHs is an oxidative
attack [3,4]. The enzymes that catalyze insertion of molecular oxygen into aromatic benzene rings are termed oxygenases [5]. They require transition metals, such as iron
and heme, as catalytic centers. Oxygenases that utilize
non-heme Fe(II) are called Rieske-type non-heme iron
aromatic ring-hydroxylating oxygenase (RHO) whereas
others that use heme are cytochrome P450s [6,7]. The
term RHO is used herein to denote the Rieske-type nonheme iron ring-hydroxylating oxygenase.
Although RHOs mostly use NAD(P)H as an electron
donor and catalyze the same oxygenation reaction, they
are remarkably diverse with respect to their structure
[3,4,8]. RHOs are multi-component enzymes of two or
three protein components consisting of an electron transport chain (ETC) and an oxygenase. Oxygenase components are either homo- (αn) or hetero-oligomers (αnβn)
and in each case, the α subunit, called large subunit, contains two conserved regions, a Rieske [2Fe-2S] center and
non-heme mononuclear iron. The α subunits are known
to be the catalytic components involved in the transfer of
electrons to oxygen molecules. The ETC that transfers
reducing equivalents from NAD(P)H to the oxygenase
components consists of either a flavoprotein reductase or
a flavoprotein reductase and a ferredoxin [3,4]. An interaction between oxygenase and ETC components is
required for the enzyme system to transfer electrons from
the electron donor to aromatic hydrocarbon electron
acceptor. The RHO enzyme system has been extensively
studied in many different microorganisms since the initial
reaction mostly determines the aromatic substrate for degradation [9-15].
Classification of RHOs is essentially an effort to organize
the information into a system that is useful for understanding the relationship between various aspects of
sequence, structure, function and evolution. A three-class
system (class I, II and III) was initially instituted by Batie
et al. [16]. Based on the number of constituent components and the nature of the redox centers, this classification was able to give systematic information about RHOs.
We will refer to this approach as "the traditional classification". With the recent tremendous accumulation of new
sequence information on RHOs, there is a current need
for a new classification strategy that can transform the
multitude of complex data into useful organized information. In this regard, computational phylogenetic analysis
of molecular sequence was imperative, which we term
"the phylogenetic classification". Several challenges have
been introduced using this method. Werlen et al. [17]

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/9/11

grouped RHOs into four families based on substrate specificities and sequence alignments with associated distance calculations. This classification emphasized the
structure-function relationship of the oxygenase component. However, some RHOs appear not to fit in this
scheme probably because of the small RHO sample pool
which resulted in the partial observation. Nam et al. [18]
also proposed a clustering system based on the homology
of the amino acid sequences of terminal oxygenase components. This classification system was more inclusive
and well reflected the phylogenetic affiliation among
RHOs.
In recent years, we characterized 3 oxygenases, NidAB,
NidA3B3 and PhtAaAb, from M. vanbaalenii PYR-1
involved in the oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons
[9,10,15,19]. Phylogenetic analysis of these oxygenase
components, NidA, NidA3 and PhtAa, showed that they
clustered with a new group of α subunits found in Nocardioides, Rhodococcus, Terrabacter, Arthrobacter and other
Mycobacterium spp. [20-25]. Interestingly, RHO genes
found in this group of bacteria appear to have features in
common; genes for ETC components are not always
closely positioned with oxygenase genes (genetic discreteness) and limited numbers of ferredoxin and reductase
components are shared by multiple oxygenases (numerical imbalance). Interestingly, ferredoxin components,
that are compatible with the oxygenase enzymes from this
bacterial group, were often identified to be a [3Fe-4S] cluster type [20,22,23]. The [3Fe-4S] type of ferredoxin has
been recently introduced as an ETC component for RHO
enzyme systems, the other ferredoxin components being
the [2Fe-2S] type. In fact, NidAB and NidA3B3 from PYR1 were also shown to be compatible with the [3Fe-4S]type ferredoxin, PhtAc and ferredoxin reductase (PhtAd)
[19]. However, the classification system proposed by Batie
et al. and Nam et al. can not explain these new RHO features, the [3Fe-4S]-type ferredoxin, genetic discreteness of
ETC components and the numerical imbalance between
oxygenase and ETC component. In addition, considering
that RHOs are multi-component enzyme systems, ETC
components along with oxygenases components are also
necessary for their functional understanding. Therefore,
the new classification system was launched with the aim
of analyzing the RHO components as a whole. The classification system not only systematically incorporates each
component data but also basically reflects the previous
"traditional" and "phylogenetic" classification.

Methods
Sequences retrieving
The amino acid sequences of RHO enzymes were retrieved
by BLAST searches from public databases including NCBI
nonredundant (NR) protein database [26]. From several
hundreds of RHO enzymes that were recovered, we first

ended up with the selection of 130 RHO enzymes. Among
them, 25 "standard" RHO enzymes were chosen (Table 1)
and used to construct the new classification system. These
standard RHO enzymes are all well known with respect to
genetics and enzyme functions. We also took sequence
identities among RHO enzymes into consideration for the
selection of standard RHO samples, in which highly identical RHOs were only once selected, so as for the samples
to be a full representative of RHO enzymes. The size of the
25 standard RHOs as well as their quality as an RHO representative were statistically examined. To evaluate the
new classification scheme, 38 RHO samples (Table 2)
were selected as test enzyme systems. For some of these
test enzymes, the genetic information for both the oxygenase and ETC components are available whereas for others only oxygenase information is available. To apply the
new classification system, a total of 130 RHO enzymes,
which include additional 67 RHO enzymes, were classified.
Sequence analysis
ClustalX [27] was used to obtain multiple alignments followed by distance calculations for each RHO component.
Pairwise and multiple alignments were carried out with
the default parameters. The weight matrix, Gonnet 250,
was used to obtain the pairwise distance (PD) matrix.
Alignments were visualized and examined using GENEDOC [28]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by NJ
method [29] from distance data and visualized and

manipulated with TREEVIEW 1.6.6 [30]. Tree was also
generated using iTOL: Interactive Tree Of Life, an online
phylogenetic tree viewer and Tree Of Life resource [31].
The reliability of the trees obtained was evaluated by 1000
bootstrap replications. The domain structures for reductase components were analyzed using the Conserved
Domain (CD) Database of NCBI [32], which compares
primary sequences with all of the known domain structures in the databases.
Statistical analysis
Matlab™ (The Mathworks, Inc.) was used to implement
the proposed algorithm and to perform the simulation.
The program under Matlab generates random subsets
among 43 RHO samples, performs cluster analysis using
the pairwise distance (PD) matrices and obtains the PD
value which maximizes the classification accuracy. In the
program, ClustalX [27] was used to obtain multiple alignments and PD matrices. The total running time spent for
the simulation used in this paper is less than an hour and
the matlab source code (.m) of the program is available
upon request.

Results
Construction of the new classification scheme was accomplished as shown in the flowchart (Figure 1). Briefly, we
first analyzed a total of 130 RHO enzymes in which 25
well-characterized RHO enzymes were selected as standards to test our hypothesis for the proposed classification

system (Table 1). From the sequence analysis of ETC components of the standard RHO samples, we extracted the
classification keys that reflect the phylogenetic relationship among ETC components, which turned into the
grouping criteria in the following classifications. Next,
oxygenases were phylogenetically classified with the classification keys obtained from ETC analyses. Finally we
constructed the new systematic classification through statistical justification and tested its applicability with 38
RHO samples.
Step 1: Sampling standard RHOs
Table 1 shows the list of the 25 standard RHO samples
whose genetic and functional information were completely available. It includes the members of Batie's three
classes and Nam's four groups [16,18] and others that are
not mentioned in those classifications. They are phenanthrene dioxygenase of Nocardioides sp. KP7 [11] and
phthalate dioxygenases of Terrabacter sp. DBF63 [33],

Arthrobacter keyseri 12B [23], M. vanbaalenii PYR-1 [10]
and Rhodococcus sp. RHA1 [34]. The ferredoxin components of these RHO enzymes are the [3Fe-4S] type ferredoxin; only [2Fe-2S] type ferredoxin components were
analyzed in the previous classification.
Step 2: Sequence analysis of ETC components from
standard RHO samples
In step 2, phylogenetic information was obtained from
the amino acid sequences of RHO ETC components,
which in turn were converted into classification keys for
grouping of oxygenase components for step 3 analyses.
Reductase components
The phenogram with the domain arrangements of reductases is presented in Figure 2. The 25 reductases were
divided into three groups, Rd-I, Rd-II and Rd-III, based on
the conserved domain arrangements. When grouped with
PD value of 0.85, the 25 reductases can also be grouped

into the same three groups. Therefore, the PD values
obtained by using Gonnet weight matrix were less than
0.85 within each group which has the same arrangement
of conserved domains. Group Rd-I consists of glutathione
reductase (GR) type reductases that show over 28% amino
acid identity to one another, while groups Rd-II and Rd-III
include the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) type
reductases that show over 15 and 23% amino acid identity
within each group, respectively. Groups Rd-II and Rd-III
share the same three domains for flavin, NAD and [2Fe2S] binding, but show different domain arrangements. In
group Rd-II, the [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin domains are connected to the C-terminus of NAD domains, but to the Nterminus of flavin-binding domains in group Rd-III. The
overall degree of sequence identity between the Group
Rd-II and Rd-III is generally no more than 14%. Accord-

ingly, group Rd-I, Rd-II and Rd-III are designated as GRtype, FNRC-type and FNRN-type reductases, respectively,
and were selected as classification keys for the reductase
components of RHO enzymes.

ferredoxin components of standard RHO systems. Conserved amino acid residues were also shown to reveal the
classification keys for ferredoxins. For the sequence alignment of ferredoxins, we initially aligned [2Fe-2S]-type and
[3Fe-4S]-type ferredoxins separately and identified conserved amino acids. Multiple sequence alignment for the
all ferredoxin sequences was then performed, from which
we evaluated the validity of alignment. The tree shows
that the 16 ferredoxins are divided into two distinct

groups based on the type of iron-sulfur clusters, designated group Fd-I and Fd-II. The PD values within each
group were less than 0.716. While the overall degree of
amino acid sequence identity between groups is no more
than 20%, members in each group show over 29%
sequence identity to one another. In this analysis, Fdx3, a
putidaredoxin-type ferredoxin isolated from Sphingomonas wittichii RW1, was used as an outgroup because
Fdx3 is phylogenetically unrelated to those of RHO
enzymes [35]. The group Fd-I comprises the [3Fe-4S] cluster-containing ferredoxins. Sequence alignments of this
group revealed three conserved cysteine residues which
serve as ligands for the [3Fe-4S] cluster. Group Fd-II consists of the [2Fe-2S] cluster-containing ferredoxins con-

taining a highly conserved [2Fe-2S]-binding motif,
CXHXnCX2H. Accordingly, group Fd-I and Fd-II are
referred as [3Fe-4S]- and [2Fe-2S]-type ferredoxins, respectively, which in turn were selected as classification keys for
ferredoxin components of RHOs.
Step 3: Sequence analysis and grouping of oxygenase
components from standard RHO samples
This step involves integration of the phylogenetic data of
oxygenase components with respect to the classification
keys obtained from ETC components. Figure 4 shows the
dendrogram of 25 oxygenase components of standard
RHO samples by the neighbor-joining (NJ) approach with
CarAa from Pseudomonas resinovorans CA10 as an out-

The amino acid residues involved in binding to [2Fe-2S] (CXHXnCXXH) and [3Fe-4S] (CX5CXnC) cluster are indicated by

group. The 25 oxygenase components can be clustered
into two groups of homo (αn) and hetero (αnβn) oligomers (Figure 4). The homo-oligomer oxygenases include
CbaA from Alcaligenes sp. BR60, PobA from Pseudomonas
pseudoalcaligenes POB310, OphA2 from Burkholderia cepacia DBO1, TsaM from Comamonas testosteroni T-2 and
CarAa from the strain CA10. However, when grouped
with the classification keys from the phylogenetic analysis
of ETC components, the 25 oxygenases are clustered into
six distinct groups, designated Ox-I (an FNRC-type reductase and a homo-oligomer oxygenase (αn)), Ox-II (an
FNRC-type reductase and a hetero-oligomer type oxygenase (αnβn)), Ox-III (an FNRN-type reductase and an oxygenase (αnβn)), Ox-IV (a hetero-oligomer oxygenase (αnβn),
a [2Fe-2S]-type ferredoxin and an FNRN-type reductase),
Ox-V (a hetero-oligomer oxygenase (αnβn), a [2Fe-2S]type ferredoxin and a GR-type reductase) and Ox-VI (a
hetero-oligomer oxygenase (αnβn), a [3Fe-4S]-type ferredoxin and a GR-type reductase) (Figure 4). Groups Ox-I,
Ox-II and Ox-III consist of two-component RHO systems,
while groups Ox-IV, Ox-V and Ox-VI include three-component RHO systems.

In Figure 5, the PD values within each group that shares
the same classification keys were less than 0.61 with the
exception of group Ox-I. This group can be further divided
into four subgroups if using 0.61 as a PD value, where 25
oxygenases can be clustered into 10 groups including the
outgroup of CarAa from CA10. Therefore, the PD value,
0.61, is a suitable criterion for grouping oxygenases based
on our classification keys.
Step 4: Construction of the new systematic classification
In this step, the integrated classification data were converted to a systematic classification. As shown in Figure 6,
the standard 25 RHO samples can be organized into 5 distinct types from 10 groups which clustered at the PD value
of 0.61, designated type I, II, III, IV and V. All the members
within each type share the same classification keys of ETC
components. Type I and III can be further divided into
two subtypes, being designated αβ and α according to the
type of oxygenase components in the RHO system; oxygenase components in the subtype αβ and α are hetero-oligomers (αnβn) and homo-oligomers (αn), respectively.

Phylogenetic clustering of oxygenase components from standard RHO enzymes with regard to the type of their ETC compoPhylogenetic clustering of oxygenase components from standard RHO enzymes with regard to the type of
their ETC components. The tree was constructed by the NJ method with CarAa from P. resinovorans CA10 as an outgroup.

The type I system represents two-component RHOs that
consist of an FNRC-type reductase and an oxygenase,
which is either hetero-oligomer (type Iαβ) or homo-oligomer (type Iα). The RHO systems of group Ox-I and OxII belong to the type Iαβ and type Iα, respectively. Type II
represents the other two-component systems that consist
of an oxygenase and a FNRN-type reductase. The RHO
enzymes in group Ox-III fall into type II. The well-characterized system for type II is benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase
(BenABC) from Acinetobacter sp. ADP1. Type III represents
three-component systems that consist of an oxygenase, a
[2Fe-2S]-type ferredoxin and an FNRN-type reductase. All
of group Ox-IV belong to type IIIαβ. The carbazole 1,9adioxygenase (CarAaAcAd) from P. resinovorans CA10 used
as an outgroup for reconstructing the dendrogram of oxygenase components was determined to be type IIIα. The
type IV systems represent another three-component sys-

tems that consist of an oxygenase, a [2Fe-2S]-type ferredoxin and a GR-type reductase. Type IV was shown to be
the biggest group for the known RHO enzyme systems.
Type V represents another different three-component systems that consist of an oxygenase, a [3Fe-4S]-type ferredoxin and a GR-type reductase. The RHO samples of the
group Ox-VI were belonged to type V. The well-known
example of the type V enzyme is phenanthrene dioxygenase (PhdABCD) from Nocardioides sp. KP7, in which the
PhdC was the first [3Fe-4s]-type ferredoxin to be found in
RHO enzyme systems.
Step 5: Statistical justification of the new systematic
classification
In this step, we statistically examined the classification
scheme; the proposed PD value and the size and quality
of the standard RHOs were evaluated using in-house pro-

gram. Here, the learning accuracy is defined as the ratio of
the number of correctly classified observations and the
total number of observations.
First, we evaluated which PD value maximizes the classification accuracy for the 25 standard RHO set by the following algorithm:
INPUT: N oxygenases
(1) Select randomly four key oxygenases a2, a3, a4 and a5
from each categories II, III, IV, V respectively.
(2) At each of the N-1 steps p0, p1, ..., pn, the closest two
clusters are merged into a single cluster.
(3) Define cut-off distances as qi = (pi-1 + pi)/2 for each i =
1,..., n. For each qi, a cluster is classified as category I, if
there is no a2~a5 in the cluster. If one or more of ai's (i = 2,
..., 5) are present in the cluster, the cluster is classified randomly as one of their category. Calculate the learning
accuracy and find the cutoff which maximizes the learning
accuracy.

Figure 7 is an output data showing the relations among
learning accuracy, PD value and RHO classification result
deduced from the 25 standard RHOs. This data indicates
clearly that the PD value 0.611 satisfies demand for the
classification of 25 standard RHO set with a maximum
learning accuracy 1.0.
Based on the estimation of PD value, we devised a simulation to determine the suitable set of oxygenases which
may minimize the classification error during the prediction. For the purpose of simulation, we used a total of 43
oxygenases which includes 25 standard and 18 test RHO
samples. The training sets of 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 RHOs
were randomly selected from a total of 43 oxygenases for
50 times for each training set. Then, we evaluated the PD
values which attain the maximum learning accuracy using
the above algorithm for each set. Table 3 indicates that the
mean deviation of such PD values is close to 0.61 and the
values are not much affected by the number of observations, although mean PD values diminishes as the
number of oxygenases increases. Figure 8 shows the simulation result based on 50 repetitions for 25 randomly
selected RHOs, which indicates that the maximum accuracy is obtained at the mean PD value of 0.619. In Figure
9, it was further shown that the PD values of 25 oxygen-

ases are most stable except for the set of entire 43 oxygenases, although there are some outliers which increase the
variance. This simulation test can give us reliability of the
25 standard RHO set and PD value 0.611 for our classification.
Step 6: Test of the new classification systems
The reliability of the new classification system was evaluated by examining its applicability and usefulness in the
classification of 38 RHO enzymes that ranged broadly
over the various type of RHO enzymes (Table 2). The
selection criteria are as follows. At first, 14 complete RHO
enzymes for which both genetic and functional information were well-known were selected. They were chosen for
the purpose of verification of the classification systems,
which are the same case as those standard RHO samples.
Next, the 24 incomplete RHO enzymes were further

selected. These incomplete samples include some of the
RHO enzymes which have been functionally characterized by gene complementation with compatible source of
ETC components and others that have other known
equivalent homologs from which ETC information could
be deduced.
Figure 10 shows the strategy used for the classification of
test RHO enzymes. Basically, the strategy depends on
whether RHOs sequence information is limited. In the
case of complete RHO samples, query sequences were first
subjected to multiple alignments followed by systematic
classification; oxygenase components of RHOs undergo a
phylogenetic classification whereas ETC sequences go
through traditional classification route which are lastly
consolidated into the final classification. In contrast,
when analyzing incomplete RHOs, due to the lack of

sequence information of the ETC component, only the
oxygenase part can be classified according to the phylogenetic analysis. One of the merits of this classification strategy is that it responds dynamically to the growing pool of
RHO enzymes. As shown in Figure 10, the output (final

classification) of the classification system is returned to
increase the standard sequence pool. As the standard RHO
pool is growing, the classification gets more stable and
objective and could possibly expand its coverage for many
other RHO enzymes.
Figure 11 shows the result of systematic/phylogenetic
analysis for the classification of a total of 63 RHOs which
comprised 25 standard and 38 test enzyme samples. This
tree has a similar branching structure to that of the standard RHOs samples (Figure 3). It also mirrors well our classification scheme. When analyzing complete test RHO
enzymes, the phylogenetic classification results of oxygenase components were in agreement with those of the traditional classification of ETC components. That is to say,
ETC sequences of these complete RHO samples were identified by the classification keys to be the same types to

which the respective oxygenase components were
assigned. For example, both oxygenase (PahA3) and ETC
components (PahA1A2) from P. aeruginosa Pak1 naphthalene dioxygenase were shown to be typed IIIA by phylogenetic and traditional classification, respectively. It
indicates that our systematic classification reflects exactly
the relationship/partnership between oxygenase and ETC,
which strongly demonstrates that our classification
scheme has a potential to classify incomplete RHOs.
The 24 incomplete test RHO samples were all classified
and assigned to each type by phylogenetic analysis. For
instance, NidA and NidA3 from M. vanbaalenii PYR-1 were
clustered together with phenanthrene dioxygenase (PhdABCD) from Nocardioides sp. KP7 being allocated to type
V with a high bootstrap score and stable PD support. Oxygenases from Novosphingobium aromaticivorans F199
(BphA1a, BphA1b and BphA1f), Sphingomonas sp. P2
(AhdA1a and AhdA1b), Cycloclasticus sp. A5 (PhnA1) and
Sphingomonas sp. CHY-1 (PhnA1a) were clustered into
type IIIαβ with high bootstrap and stable PD values. In
case of NagG from Ralstonia sp. U2, it was classified as

type III with the complete RHO, HybB, from P. aeruginosa
JB2. Another incomplete RHO samples, BphA1c and
BphA1d from the strain F199, AhdA1c and AhdA1d from
P2 and PhnA1b from CHY-1 were clustered as type IV
together with the complete RHO, AndAc, from DBO1.
Interestingly, BphA1c from the strain F199, AhdA1c from
P2 and PhnA1b from CHY-1 of type IV can also be
grouped into type IIIαβ with HybB from JB2 (2-hydroxybenzoate 5-salicylate hydroxylase) based on the PD value
of 0.61 (Figure 8). This means that those three type IV
RHOs are in the intersection with type IIIαβ. Both XylX
oxygenase components from the strain F199 and P2 were
grouped into the type II. Notably, ORF25, BphA1e and
AhdA1e from the strain PYR-1, F199 and P2, respectively,
formed a single distinctive separate cluster with a stable
PD value; no standard or complete RHO is clustered
together. In this case, although the genetic information of
ETC for these three oxygenases are lacking, they were tentatively classified as type IV since BphA1e from the strain
P2 was shown to be functionally active when complemented with the ETC component from type IV [36]. In
fact, if all the classification keys are combined, we would

components have been experimentally shown to be the
same as [3Fe-4S]-type ferredoxin and GR-type reductase
[9,10,15,19]. In this respect, the results presented in Figure 12 well reflects the phylogenetic affiliations which are
integrated with the interactions between RHO enzyme
components.

Step 7: classification of a total of 130 RHO enzymes
As a final, a total of 130 RHO enzymes, which include 67
new RHO sequences, were classified using our classification system. Figure 12 shows an output based on the new
classification system, which has a similar branching structure to that of the test set shown in step 6. Although RHO
enzymes seem to have a grouping tendency according to
their substrate specificities, the classification clearly indicates that the phylogenetic affiliations of RHO enzymes
are determined mainly by their relationship with ETC
components. For example, as shown in Type V, PhtAa
(phthalate dioxygenase) and NidA3 (fluoranthene dioxygenase) from PYR-1 are grouped together. Although their
substrates have been reported to be different, their ETC

Discussion
In many cases, RHO oxygenases have not been identified
together with ETC components, thus it has been a challenging task to find a cognate ETC partner that can function in cooperation with these "incomplete" oxygenase
components [9,35-39]. Since some ETCs are interchangeable with each other and can be often replaced by outside
ETC sources and it is the terminal oxygenase component
that has the catalytic active site, less emphasis was given to
ETC components in Nam's classification. For example,
DitA from P. abietaniphila BKME-9 and NidA from Rhodococcus sp. strain I24 were clustered in group III together
with NahAc from Pseudomonas sp. NCIB9816-4 and PahAc
from P. putida OUS82. However, these two oxygenases,

DitA and NidA, which lacked ETC information (only
ferredoxin for DitA is known), initially formed a group
different from that of NahAc and PahAc in the phylogenetic classification route, being classified as type V that
represents the three-component systems consisting of an
oxygenase, a [3Fe-4S]-type ferredoxin and a GR-type
reductase. Whereas the NahAc and PahAc were classified
as type III which consists of an oxygenase, a [2Fe-2S]-type

ferredoxin and an FNRN-type reductase. The discrepancy
between these two classification's results comes from ETC
information that reflects the relationship among oxygenases. The classification in Nam's scheme was based on
pairwise sequence homology of oxygenase components,
in which four percentage sets, 0–14, 15–24, 25–34 and
35–99%, were used. In the new classification, however,
the grouping criterion for oxygenase components, which

BMC Biochemistry 2008, 9:11

is a PD value of 0.62, was objectively determined based on
ETC information. This PD value finally determines the
two oxygenases, DitA and NidA, differently from the
NahAc and PahAc. The results clearly show that information on oxygenases whose ETC components are not available can be used to draw ETC data in our classification
system.
This new classification system provides insights into the
evolutionary changes and relationships between oxygenase and ETC components. Seven oxygenase components,
BphA1 [a-f] and XylX from N. aromaticivorans F199 [37]
are of particular interest in this context. Although other
ETC components are maybe involved, those oxygenases
from F199, which were found to be scattered throughout
several gene clusters, seem to function with a limited
number of ETC components. Two ferredoxins (Rieske[2Fe-2S]-type BphA3 and plant- [2Fe-2S]-type XylT) and
two reductases (GR-type BphA4 and FNR-type XylM) have
been identified on the aromatic catabolic plasmid (pNL1)
of F199. These oxygenases were classified as type II (XylX),
IIIA (BphA1 [a,b,f]) and IV (BphA1 [c-e]) (Figure 8).
Although there is no functional data available directly
from the strain F199, genetic information with functional
evidence have been reported from other sphingomonads
which matches with those of F199. For example, sets of
genes for an oxygenase from Sphingobium sp. P2 (AhdA1
[a-e]) [36], S. yanoikuyae B1 (BphA1c and XylX) [40,41]
and Sphingobium sp. CHY-1 (PhnA1a and PhnA1b) [42]
were reported to have the same gene arrangement with
63–97% sequence identity when compared to F199. Consequently, they were classified as the same types with
those from F199; type II for XylX (B1), type IIIαβ for
AhdA1 [a,b] (P2), PhnA1a (CHY-1) and type IV for
BphA1c (B1), AhdA1 [c-e] (P2) and PhnA1b (CHY-1). We
found that, without an exception, they were experimentally shown to use type IV ETC (all named as BphA3A4)
that consists of [2Fe-2S]-type ferredoxin and GR-type
reductase (Figure 6). These ETCs are highly homologous
(> 79%) to the BphA3A4 from F199. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that the 7 oxygenase components
(BphA1 [a-f] and XylX) from F199 might be sharing the
same type of ETC, BphA3A4. This implies that the limited
ETC (BphA3A4) probably makes for strong selective pressure, favoring oxygenase components that can rapidly
adapt by increasing their tolerance toward alternative
ETC. This adaptation should be accompanied by the
change of genetic information, which suggesting that
RHO enzymes are probably evolving under the direction
of selective pressure derived from ETCs. In fact, although
BphA1c from F199 was clustered in type IV, it intersected
with type III, the group of 2-hydroxybenzoate 5-salicylate
hydroxylase (HybABCD) from P. aeruginosa JB2 (Figure
8). It suggests that BphA1c from F199 is probably evolving
under the selective pressure derived from limited ETC. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/9/11

XylX from the strain B1 is also worth noting, XylX belongs
to type II, the two-component RHO enzymes, which normally functions with an FNR-type reductase. However, it
was unexpectedly shown to be compatible with BphA3A4
[40,41]. Although both ferredoxins from type III and IV
are [2Fe-2S]-type, the ferredoxin component (BphA3)
from B1 seems phylogenetically inclined to be branched
with ferredoxins which can complement oxygenases
belong to type IIIαβ. The inclination of the ferredoxin
component (BphA3) toward type IIIαβ also can be seen in
the RHO enzyme from Cycloclasticus sp. A5, of which
PhnA1 and PhnA3 components showed high identities
over 62% with those (BphA1f and BphA3, respectively)
from the strain F199 [43]. In this case, the oxygenase
(PhnA1) belongs to type IIIαβ with the ETC components
consist of a [2Fe-2S]-type ferredoxin (PhnA3) and an
FNRN-type reductase (PhnA4). Taken together, the 7 oxygenases from F199, belonging to type II, IIIA and IV, were
classified by our system to work with the three different
ETC groups, FNRN-type reductase, [2Fe-2S]-type ferredoxins/FNRN-type reductase and [2Fe-2S]-type ferredoxins/
GR-type reductase, respectively. However, all those oxygenases are assumed to function with [2Fe-2S]-type ferredoxin and GR-type reductase. From these observations
question may arise about the degree of specificity in recognition between redox partners.
RHO pool is believed to respond dynamically to the environmental transitions such as substrate changes. In addition, relative tolerance between oxygenase and ETC
components is also thought to be one of the important
selective forces in evolution. In this context, even though
little is known as to the role of ferredoxin component
under selective pressure, it seems likely to be deeply
involved in evolutionary changes. A possible benefit for
using ferredoxin comes from its potential to promptly
enhance the tolerance toward new redox partners. Cognizant of "the shorter, the faster and more effective",
because of the relatively short sequence and simple structure of ferredoxin than that of reductase component, it has
an evolutionary merit to adapt rapidly to dynamic environments. Hence, it might be an attractive hypothesis that
ferredoxin has been evolutionarily chosen as a buffer
between reductase and oxygenase component for rapid
adaptation toward selective force. It might also be a strong
driving force to affect the direction of evolution from twocomponent RHO to/toward three-component. Considering this two-way communication flow in RHO system, the
adoption of ferredoxin as a new redox partner must have
led to the changes in other partners, reductase and oxygenase, in RHO system. In this context, type III RHO seems
likely to be a living fossil that has recorded evolutionary
changes because they show transitional properties from
two-component to three-component system. Two-component systems for type I and II share FNR-type reductase,

Page 17 of 20

BMC Biochemistry 2008, 9:11

FNRC- and FNRN-type, respectively, which consist of three
domains (flavin, NAD and [2Fe-2S] binding). On the
other hand, three-component systems for type IV and V,
except for type III, share a GR-type reductase, which have
no [2Fe-2S] cluster (Figure 2 and Figure 6). A [2Fe-2S]
cluster of reductases separates the two-component system
(type I and II) from the three-component system (type IV
and V). It strongly demonstrates that the joining of ferredoxin to the two-component RHO system was probably
the start of the type III three-component structure. During
evolution, the type III FNRN-type reductases might have
been gradually changed toward type IV and V GR-type
reductases, although it is not sure whether it was recruited
from other systems. In some cases, it might also be possible under extreme conditions that type I and II RHO systems evolved directly to type IV (or V) as seen in the XylX
from S. yanoikuyae B1. Taken together, it may be postulated that RHOs are evolving under selective pressures
from type I and II (two-component system) toward type
IV and V (three-component), in which this change moves
toward efficiency and keeps going continuously under
dynamic environments.

Conclusion
In this study, we have developed a new classification system to classify bacterial Rieske non-heme iron aromatic
ring-hydroxylating oxygenases. The new classification system presented in this study not only reflects sequence
information but also interactions between RHO enzyme
components. The system is characterized by the features
that include the following. First, the new classification system analyzes RHO enzymes as a whole, in which information on each RHO components is organized into a system
that is useful for the understanding of various aspects with
respect to sequence, structure and biochemical function.
Second, our new classification system is not static but
responds dynamically to the growing pool of RHO
enzymes. As standard RHO samples increase, the classification system evolves, which gets more stable and objective and could increase its coverage of many other RHO
enzymes. Third, our classification can be applied reliably
to the classification of incomplete RHOs. Fourth, the classification has direct applicability to experimental work.
Our classification can provide the information about cognate ETC partners for oxygenase catalytic activity. Fifth,
the system provides new insights into the evolution of
RHO systems based on enzyme interaction.
