Abstract
Background: Many species of stalk-eyed flies (Diopsidae) possess highly-exaggerated, sexually dimorphic
eye-stalks that play an important role in the mating system of these flies. Eye-stalks are increasingly being
used as a model system for studying sexual selection, but little is known about the genetic mechanisms
producing variation in these ornamental traits. Therefore, we constructed an EST database of genes
expressed in the developing eye-antennal imaginal disc of the highly dimorphic species Teleopsis dalmanni.
We used this set of genes to construct microarray slides and compare patterns of gene expression
between lines of flies with divergent eyespan.
Results: We generated 33,229 high-quality ESTs from three non-normalized libraries made from the
developing eye-stalk tissue at different developmental stages. EST assembly and annotation produced a
total of 7,066 clusters comprising 3,424 unique genes with significant sequence similarity to a protein in
either Drosophila melanogaster or Anopheles gambiae. Comparisons of the transcript profiles at different
stages reveal a developmental shift in relative expression from genes involved in anatomical structure
formation, transcription, and cell proliferation at the larval stage to genes involved in neurological
processes and cuticle production during the pupal stages. Based on alignments of the EST fragments to
homologous sequences in Drosophila and Anopheles, we identified 20 putative gene duplication events in T.
dalmanni and numerous genes undergoing significantly faster rates of evolution in T. dalmanni relative to
the other Dipteran species. Microarray experiments identified over 350 genes with significant differential
expression between flies from lines selected for high and low relative eyespan but did not reveal any
primary biological process or pathway that is driving the expression differences.
Conclusion: The catalogue of genes identified in the EST database provides a valuable framework for a
comprehensive examination of the genetic basis of eye-stalk variation. Several candidate genes, such as
crooked legs, cdc2, CG31917 and CG11577, emerge from the analysis of gene duplication, protein evolution
and microarray gene expression. Additional comparisons of expression profiles between, for example,
males and females, and species that differ in eye-stalk sexual dimorphism, are now enabled by these
resources.

Background

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/361

the transcript profile of developing tissue for a highly
exaggerated, sexually dimorphic character in the stalkeyed fly, Teleopsis dalmanni.

Sexual selection is responsible for much of the morphological diversity among animals. This diversity is often
expressed in the form of male ornamental display traits.
Sexually selected characters are unusual among phenotypic traits in that they often maintain high levels of
genetic variation despite being influenced by strong selection pressures [1]. This rare combination of abundant
intraspecific variation and rapid diversification means
that these characters are particularly useful for examining
the molecular basis of morphological evolution. Despite
widespread study of sexually selected characters, few
attempts have been made to identify variation at the
molecular level associated with these ornamental traits.
Because males and females share most of the same genes,
differences in the timing and pattern of gene expression
are likely to be the primary mechanism producing sexually dimorphic phenotypes.

The elongation of the head into stalks, a condition known
as hypercephaly, has evolved independently within Diptera over 20 times [15]. Flies in the family Diopsidae provide one of the most dramatic examples of this
phenomenon. In males of some species, the elongation is
so extreme that the length of the eye-stalks exceeds the
length of the body. Like Drosophila, diopsids are part of a
subsection of higher Dipterans known as Acalyptrate flies.
The Acalyptrata only contain 20% of all described Diptera, but include all of the hypercephalic species. This clustered phylogenetic distribution suggests that Acalyptrate
flies may possess some morphological or developmental
characteristic that makes them more likely to undergo
head modification [15].

Sex is one of the major factors affecting variation in gene
expression [2,3]. Studies on Drosophila [4-7] have estimated that between 1/3 and 1/2 of the genome show sexspecific expression, and that much of this variation is heritable [4,8-10]. This variation is mirrored at the interspecific level where even more dramatic patterns of variation
have been found. Ranz et al. [7] showed that over 80% of
the genes that exhibited expression differences between D.
melanogaster and D. simulans have a sex-specific pattern of
change. Half of these evolutionary changes involve the
gain, loss or reversal of sex-biased expression and most of
these differences involve genes with male-biased expression. However, a subsequent study comparing these taxa
did not find such substantial shifts in the pattern of sexspecific gene expression among species [11].

There are nearly 200 described diopsid species in 13 genera [16,17]. Comparative analysis has revealed that
extremely large, sexually dimorphic, male eyespan has
evolved independently within the family several times
[18]. Experiments examining the function of eye-stalks in
the mating system of diopsids have provided considerable
information about their adaptive significance. They are
critical as a signaling device in both male-male competition [19,20] and female choice [21,22]. In many sexually
dimorphic species, males fight for and defend aggregation
sites where matings occur. Both field and lab experiments
have demonstrated that the size of a male's eyespan affects
his ability to control these mating sites and that females
tend to prefer sites controlled by males with larger eyestalks.

The majority of Drosophila microarray experiments examining sex-specific gene expression have focused on wholebody adult tissue. Attempts to separate the sex-specific
expression patterns of gonads and somatic tissue [12,13]
have found substantially reduced sex-specific expression
in somatic tissue relative to gonads. Few studies have
examined differential gene expression with respect to a
specific sexually dimorphic phenotype. In one example,
Barmina et al. [14] used microarray analysis to examine
the pattern of gene expression in the developing first and
second legs of males and females. The first leg of D. melanogaster is sexually dimorphic with respect to bristle patterns while the second leg exhibits little dimorphism.
Consistent with the phenotypic differences, they found
over 100 genes with sex-specific expression in the first leg
but no genes with sexual differences in expression in the
second leg. Additional research focusing on the gene
expression of specific sexually dimorphic tissue is critical
to understanding the genetic factors responsible for the
evolution of sex-specific phenotypes. Here, we report on

Among diopsids there is substantial variation both
between sexes and among species in the amount of heritable genetic variation associated with eyespan [23], and
this heritable variation is more tightly linked to overall
condition for male eyespan than for other morphological
traits [24-26]. In Teleopsis dalmanni, artificial selection on
male relative eyespan reveals that genes that influence
male eyespan also influence female eyespan [27] and
exhibit X-linkage [28]. Male eyespan serves as an indicator
of genetic quality due to an association between short eyespan and × chromosome segregation distortion [29].
Linkage mapping studies have identified quantitative trait
loci (QTL) for eyespan on the X and on both autosomes
in males [30]. Overall, quantitative genetic and phylogenetic analyses have demonstrated that the size and variance of eye-stalks is extremely labile, but the genetic
mechanisms producing this diversity have not been investigated at the molecular level. Here we provide a catalogue
of annotated transcripts present during development of
this extraordinary morphological structure.

Results and discussion
Functional profile of EST libraries
Three non-normalized cDNA libraries were made from
the eye-antennal imaginal discs and optic lobes of T. dalmanni at three developmental stages: third instar wandering larva (L), early pupae (P1) and mid pupae (P2). We
generated 33,229 high-quality expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) from these libraries with 66% of the ESTs coming
from the larval library, 10% from the early pupal library
and 24% from the mid-pupal library (Table 1). The ESTs
are available through NCBI [Genbank:GO271638–
GO304866]. The ESTs were assembled into 7,066 clusters
containing a total of 11,545 consensus sequences (conseqs). In general, multiple conseqs within a cluster
resulted from the presence of non-overlapping sequence,
allelic variation or alternative transcripts. A total of 3,697
of the clusters had two or more conseqs and 142 clusters
had four or more conseqs. 4,015 clusters contained at
least one conseq that had a significant Blast hit (< 1e-9) to
a protein in D. melanogaster and 3,410 unique genes were
represented in this list. When blasted against the protein
database for Anopheles gambiae, 3,296 clusters, comprising
2,847 unique genes, had significant hits. Among the clusters that had a hit to D. melanogaster, but not A. gambiae,
there were 504 unique genes, while 14 clusters had a hit
to A. gambiae but not D. melanogaster. An additional 384
clusters that did not have significant sequence similarity
to D. melanogaster or A. gambiae proteins had significant
hits to sequences in the non-redundant protein (nr) and
nucleotide (nt) databases with approximately half of
these hits being to transposable elements. Fourteen clusters had significant hits to microsatellites previously identified in T. dalmanni [31].

Because eye-stalks are a complex structure involving modification of the brain, eye, optic nerves and head case, no
single GO category is likely to include all, or even most, of
the genes involved in eye stalk development. Therefore,

we selected from the Gene Ontology database a number
of different Biological Process categories, such as cell
growth and regulation of cell size and cell shape, that are
likely to be important factors in eye-stalk development
and calculated for each category the percentage of D. melanogaster genes within a given category for which homologues have been identified in the Teleopsis EST database
(Figure 1). For instance, about 56% of the genes known to
affect cell growth in D. melanogaster have been identified
in the T. dalmanni libraries. Overall, we have at least 50%
of the genes in most GO categories and 53.6% of all the
relevant genes across all categories. This catalogue of
genes provides a valuable framework for a comprehensive
examination of gene expression in the developing eye
disc. In addition, these numbers likely underestimate the
percentage of relevant genes discovered in our EST database because the gene lists in Drosophila include all genes
that are expressed in any developmental stage or participating tissue. Only a subset of these genes is likely to be
relevant during eye-antennal disc development.
Developmental changes in gene expression
Comparison between the EST libraries from the larval,
early pupal and mid-pupal developmental stages indicates some significant shifts in the type of genes expressed
at each stage. We identified several GO categories that
exhibited significant over-representation in one of the
libraries relative to the EST database as a whole (Figure 2).
In general, the larval stage is characterized by an over-representation of genes involved in anatomical structure formation, transcription, and cell proliferation while the
pupal stage exhibits an increase in genes involved in neurogenesis and energy pathways followed by a substantial
increase in cuticle production.

Examination of the expression levels for individual genes
also reveals substantial differences across libraries as
numerous genes are expressed primarily in one developmental stage. Table 2 lists the genes with the largest stagespecific expression patterns as measured by the R-statistic
[32]. Thirty additional genes (Nop56, Tenascin major,
3535983, dacapo, Heat-shock-protein-70Bb, CG7188,
CG8600, Chromatin assembly factor 1 subunit, Lk6, Baldspot,

blown fuse, Chd64, Chloride intracellular channel, eyes absent,
frizzled 2, glass, ORF-141, Protein disulfide isomerase) were
represented by eight or more cDNAs in the database and
were expressed exclusively in the larval library, but had
lower R-statistic values due to the disproportionately high
EST sampling from this library.

Percentage of Drosophila genes identified in T. dalmanni EST database
Figure 1
Percentage of Drosophila genes identified in T. dalmanni EST database. For Biological Process (BP) categories that
are likely to be important in eye-stalk development and evolution, the bars represent the percentage of D. melanogaster genes
belonging to that category for which homologues have been identified in the EST database. The numbers within each bar indicate how many genes were found within that category in the T. dalmanni libraries.

In terms of gene families, all representatives of the
Enhancer of split complex (E(spl) mα, E(spl) mβ, E(spl)
m3, E(spl) m4, E(spl) m7) identified in the EST libraries
were expressed in the larval tissue. In contrast, we identified 11 genes from the Osiris complex (Osi1, Osi3, Osi6,
Osi7, Osi9, Osi14, Osi15, Osi18, Osi19, Osi20, Osi22) and
9 were expressed exclusively in the mid-pupal stage. Little
is currently know about the function of the members of
this gene family [33], but their strong association with this
pupal stage may provide insight about their role in development. Analysis of the GO terms (Figure 2) and gene
expression levels (Table 2) indicate that the production of
structural cuticle substantially increases during the middle
of pupation. In fact, we identified a total of 19 Cuticular
proteins (Cpr30F, Cpr35B, Cpr49Aa, Cpr49Ac, Cpr49Ae,

Cpr51A, Cpr56F, Cpr57A, Cpr62Bb, Cpr62Bc, Cpr64Ac,
Cpr65Eb, Cpr66Cb, Cpr66D, Cpr76Bd, Cpr92F, Cpr97Ea,
Cpr97Eb, Cpr100A) in the EST database comprising over
200 cDNAs and all but two of them were expressed exclusively in the mid-pupal library.
The distribution of transposable elements within the EST
database of T. dalmanni exhibited a particularly strong
relationship with developmental stage. We blasted (using
tblastx) all the conseqs in the EST libraries against the D.
melanogaster Transposable Element (TE) database and
found 191 clusters with significant hits to a total of 71 different types of transposable elements (Table 3). These
clusters are more likely to contain reads from the larval
library than either of the pupal libraries. Of the 191 clus-

ters with TE hits, 170 are derived exclusively from cDNAs
from the larval library, while 10 clusters are exclusive to
the early pupal library, 7 clusters from the mid pupal
library and 3 clusters from more than one developmental
stage. If we look at the total number of cDNAs within
these clusters, 252 of the 279 TE cDNAs (90%) come from
the larval library whereas only 65% of the total number of
cDNAs was sequenced from this library. Furthermore, the
mid-pupal library produced 24% of all cDNAs but this
stage contains only 4% of the TE reads. This distribution
of TE cDNAs across libraries produces an R-statistic =
22.15 and a χ2 = 78.23 (p < 0.0001), indicating that the

expression of TEs is significantly biased toward the larval
developmental stage.
Developmental shifts in the pattern of TE expression have
been detected in Drosophila [34,35] and there are numerous host factors that can influence the spatial and temporal regulation of TEs [36,37]. Most Class I
retrotransposable elements are dependent to some extent
on the host transcriptional machinery or specific host
transcription factors for their expression [38-41]. The late
larval developmental stage in T. dalmanni contains an
overabundance of genes involved in transcription (Figure
2) that may be influencing the pattern of TE expression

either through the presence of specific transcription factors or a general increase in the core transcriptional
machinery. However, there is also a disproportionately
high number of Class II DNA transposons in the late larval library and these TEs are less likely to be influenced by
the dynamics of host transcription activity [36]. An alternative explanation is that mechanisms involved in TE suppression are more active during the pupal stages.
Organisms possess a vast array of epigenetic mechanisms
that suppress TE activity [37]. One such defense system
involves the Argonaute gene family. Proteins from these
genes bind to small guide RNAs to form TE silencing complexes [42,43]. Argonaute-2, which has been shown to
form TE silencing complexes in the somatic tissue of Drosophila [43], was identified in the EST database (two cDNA
clones from the early pupal library) but not in sufficient

exist across developmental stages.
Paralogous gene assessment
Gene duplication is an important source of novel genetic
variation that can facilitate morphological evolution [4446]. Analysis of EST databases provides a valuable tool for
identifying gene duplications or gene expansions particular to the taxon of interest. The central issue in this analysis is to differentiate paralogous gene pairs from allelic
variation or alternative transcripts. Here, we have taken a
conservative approach and tentatively labeled two or
more clusters as paralogous genes established in the diopsid lineage if they meet two criteria: (1) they have greater
than 10% amino acid divergence from each other and (2)
they are both more closely related in a phylogenetic anal-

ysis to one specific Drosophila gene than to any other Drosophila gene. Using these criteria, we identified 20 pairs or
sets of clusters that may have arisen from gene duplication
events since the split between Teleopsis and Drosophila
(Figure 3). Alternatively, the duplications may have
occurred prior to the Teleopsis-Drosophila split with subsequent loss of one of the copies before the Drosophila radiation.
The branch lengths for the trees in Figure 3 provide some
indication of the amount of divergence between the T. dalmanni clusters relative to the divergence across Diptera. In
16 of the genes, the divergence between the T. dalmanni
clusters is greater than that between D. melanogaster and
D. pseudoobscura suggesting that these are true paralogs
and not different alleles of the same gene. The lack of
monophyly for a number of the cluster pairs may result
from the short length of some of the EST amino acid
sequence. Sequencing of the entire protein coding region
of these genes for T. dalmanni and a congeneric taxa will
ultimately be necessary to confirm that these clusters are
true paralogs and that both copies are functional across
the entire length of their sequence. Examination of the
gene ontology terms for these putative duplicates indicates that the set of 20 genes is significantly overrepresented for genes involved in spermatogenesis (p = 0.004;
Ribonuclear protein at 97D, quaking related 58E-3, cdc2) and
mRNA binding (p = 0.005; suppressor of variegation 205,
alan shepard, Ribonuclear protein at 97D, quaking related
58E-3, Hemomucin)
Protein evolution
Genes that play an important role in the rapid diversification of eye-stalks within diopsids may exhibit rapid rates
of change at the protein level. Therefore, we used a measure of relative protein divergence specific to T. dalmanni in
order to identify genes and GO categories undergoing
substantially faster evolution in this lineage. This measure
differs from Blast identity percentage because it standard-

izes the amount of change in the lineage leading to T. dalmanni by the total amount of evolutionary change across
other flies. Relative divergence is expressed as the percent
of total tree length comprised by the branch leading to T.
dalmanni.
Translations of putative protein coding sequence data
were obtained for 4,450 contigs comprising 3,230 unique
genes with significant homology to a gene in D. melanogaster. After alignment to Drosophila and Anopheles
sequences, trimming of poorly aligned sequences and
concatenation of multiple non-overlapping fragments, we
were left with 2,604 genes for analysis. The gene set contained an average of 342 aligned amino acids (aa) per
gene and ranged from 3,673 aa (shortstop) to 50 aa (alignments shorter than 50 were excluded from the analysis).
Based on a pairwise relative rate test, 72 genes were evolving significantly faster in T. dalmanni than in each of the
three Drosophila species included in the alignment. Figure
4 shows the branch lengths for the 20 most rapidly evolving genes within diopsids that had at least 150 aa in their
alignment.
Contrary to expectations, functional analysis of the relative gene divergence estimates did not indicate more rapid
rates of evolutionary change for genes involved in biological processes expected to be important in eye-stalk development and evolution. Analysis based on the relative
divergence rates for all 2,604 genes indicated only a single
category, transcription initiation from RNA polymerase II
promoter (GO:0006367), was evolving significantly faster
than the T. dalmanni genes on average (Figure 5). In contrast, several biological process categories–and some, such
as neurological system process, compound eye photoreceptor fate commitment and regulation of cell growth,
that are likely to be important in eye-stalk development–
are evolving significantly slower than expected (Figure 5).
Overall, when we combine all the genes that fall within
the 'important eye-stalk' BP categories listed in Figure 1,

Consensus sequences (conseqs)
from different clusters were categorized as paralogous copies of the same gene if the amino acid divergence between the T. dalmanni conseqs was greater than 10% and if all conseqs and the top hit gene from Drosophila melanogaster are monophyletic relative to the Anopheles and Apis proteins and other D. melanogaster genes. The species included in the phylogenetic analysis are
Anopheles gambiae (Ag), Apis mellifera (Am), Drosophila ananassae (Da), Drosophila erecta (De), Drosophila melanogaster (Dm),
Drosophila pseudoobscura (Dp), and Teleopsis dalmanni (Td). The seven-digit number associated with the T. dalmanni clades is the
cluster reference number. The scale bar is equivalent to 0.1.
these genes are evolving slightly slower, but not significantly different, than the rest of the genes (P = 0.099, t = 1.65).
The numerous slow-evolving categories that characterize
the T. dalmanni lineage may result from strong stabilizing
selection acting on genes in these categories in general. If
positive selection is operating on these biological processes at all it may be limited to only a few genes in each
category. For instance, the gene crooked legs (crol) is
involved in two of the slow-evolving categories–cell adhesion and tissue development–and, recently, has been
shown to represent an important step in the pathway linking ecdysone signaling and cell proliferation [47]. Unlike
other genes involved in these BP categories, crol is also
undergoing extremely rapid protein evolution (Figure 4)
and appears to have duplicated at least twice within the
lineage leading to T. dalmanni (Figure 3). Alternatively,
the gene set characterized by the list of 'important eyestalk' BP categories may not reflect the processes that are
actually important in eye-stalk evolution or rates of protein evolution may not provide a valuable indicator of
their relevance to eye-stalk evolution. It is also important
to note that, because these estimates of gene divergence
are derived from ESTs that represent only partial gene fragments, the estimated rates of evolution may be different
when the entire protein coding sequence is evaluated. Furthermore, additional sampling of species within Diptera
is necessary to verify that apparent rate differences
between T. dalmanni and Drosophila are actually specific to
diopsid lineages.
Divergence in gene expression between selection lines
Using the EST sequences to construct probes for oligonucleotide microarrays, we conducted an experiment examining differences in gene expression between lines of flies
selected for longer or shorter relative eyespan. Analysis of
eight replicate arrays [Genbank:GSE15444] revealed that
367 of 3,105 genes exhibit differential expression based
on a false discovery rate of 1%. The d-statistics for the significant genes were either greater than 2.26 or less than 2.26. Of these genes, 44 had d-statistics exceeding 5 (Table

4), 27 exhibited more than a two-fold difference in expression between the lines, and one gene, CG11577, exhibited
8 times greater expression in flies from the most extreme
high line than from the most extreme low line. Among the
367 significant genes, 40 exhibited no detectable homology to any gene in the Drosophila database, and 50
belonged to the set of 'important eye-stalk' genes defined
in Figure 1. Fourteen of the differentially expressed genes
(by S6, cdc2, CG10283, CG1575, CG15835, CG31917,
CG4598, CG6480, Kruppel, lesswright, lethal (2) k14505,
par-6, Ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase small subunit,
Small ribonucleoprotein particle protein B) are also evolving
significantly faster in T. dalmanni than other flies and, of
these, 2 genes (cdc2 and CG31917) have duplicates in the
EST database.
Functional analyses of the microarray results do not reveal
a strong pattern of relationships among the set of 367 significant differentially expressed genes. GeneMerge did not
identify any GO categories with significant overrepresentation when all differentially expressed genes were
included in the analysis set. When only genes that were
significantly down-regulated (i.e. had higher expression
values in the low line flies) were analyzed, genes involved
in RNA splicing factor activity, transesterification mechanism (GO:0031202) were significantly overrepresented
(P = 0.0362). No significant GO categories were found
among the set of up-regulated genes.
We also tested for differences in the mean d-statistic for
each biological process category relative to all the genes.
This functional assay utilizes the expression values for all
of the genes, not just those with significant expression difference between lines. Based on this analysis, genes that
play a role in gamete generation (P < 0.001), embryonic
development (P < 0.001), cell-cell adhesion (P = 0.015)
and neurological system process (P = 0.03) have significantly higher mean d-statistics than an average gene set of
similar size. This result indicates that the high line flies
had higher expression values for genes in these GO categories than the low line flies. It is likely that this pattern
results from a shift in either the developmental timing or

allometric relationship among body parts between lines.
For instance, genes involved in embryonic development
are expressed relatively early in the metamorphic process
compared with other genes in the EST database, so if high
line flies have delayed their differentiation to allow for
extra imaginal disc growth relative to low line flies, an
increase in the expression of embryonic development
genes might occur. Consistent with this interpretation,
flies from the high lines exhibit a steeper allometric relationship between eyespan and body length [27] and take
longer to develop [48] than flies from the low lines. Similarly, the optic nerve may represent a larger proportion of
the overall tissue in high line flies than in low line flies,
which could result in a slight increase in the overall level
of gene expression for neurological system process genes.
Distinguishing between these possibilities will require
additional experiments in which gene expression between
replicate and control lines is compared at multiple time
points during development.

Quantitative rtPCR
Relative expression of eight genes was estimated using
quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qrtPCR). The correlation between the average relative expression detected
by the microarray and by qrtPCR was 0.83 (Figure 6). Variation was considerably greater for qrtPCR estimates
because four, rather than eight, replicates were performed.
Nevertheless, all four genes with greater high than low
line expression showed increased high line expression by
qrtPCR and the four genes with greater low than high line
expression showed increased low line expression by qrtPCR.

Conclusion
Stalk-eyed flies in the family Diopsidae provide an excellent model system for studying sexual selection. They possess a highly exaggerated ornamental character that plays
an essential role in the mating system of numerous species
and exhibits abundant intraspecific and interspecific variation. Elevated levels of heritable genetic variation is a

common feature of sexually selected traits [1] and has
been demonstrated in the eye-stalks of diopsids [23].
However, the molecular basis of this genetic variation is
not well understood in any system. Developing a comprehensive and well-annotated catalogue of genes expressed
in the tissue developing into ornamental morphologies is
a critical step in this process. Overall, an understanding of
the genetic architecture controlling eye-stalk development

and evolution will provide critical insights concerning 1)
the developmental mechanisms controlling allometry, 2)
the genetic basis of sexual dimorphism and the convergent evolution of dimorphism and 3) the evolution of
condition dependence of ornamental traits. Here, we
report on the transcript profile of the eye-antennal imaginal disc of the sexually dimorphic stalk-eyed fly Teleopsis
dalmanni. This EST database will provide a valuable foun-

dation for further investigations into the genetic and
molecular basis of eye-stalk variation.
Variation in gene expression that shapes morphological
diversity is likely to be tissue and time dependent [14]. By
focusing our analysis of gene expression specifically
within the eye-antennal discs and adjacent optic lobes at
three developmental stages we are able to better isolate
genes important in the development and evolution of eyestalks. A microarray experiment examined differences in
gene expression between lines of flies that have been artificially selected for divergent eyespan. While this experiment did not directly examine differences in gene
expression between males and females, the selection lines
do differ in their extent of eye-stalk sexual dimorphism.
Numerous genes exhibited significantly divergent levels of
expression between selection lines but no obvious causal
genetic mechanism or pathway emerged from functional
analysis of these genes. The evolution of eye-stalk and sexual dimorphism in eye-stalks is undoubtedly a complicated morphological innovation involving numerous
genes and pathways, so it is not surprising that a single
gene expression comparison failed to pinpoint a primary

Despite a lack of clear signal when analyzed across pathways or higher level biological processes, analysis of gene
expression across the EST libraries and microarray experiment revealed several candidate genes that may play an
important role in eye-stalk evolution. Some of the more
noteworthy genes include crol, which has undergone at
least two duplications and rapid protein evolution in
diopsids, CG11577, which showed an 8-fold expression
difference between selection lines and cdc2 and CG31917
which both exhibit duplicate copies, rapid protein evolution and differential gene expression between selection
line flies. Little is known about the function of CG11577
and CG31917 in Drosophila, but both crol and cdc2 are
important developmental genes influencing cell cycle progression [47,49]. Crol is of particular interest because it is
regulated by ecdysone and mutations in the gene influence head eversion and appendage elongation [50,51],
phenotypic effects that are likely to be relevant to eye-stalk
development.

Methods
cDNA library construction and EST sequencing
The adult head structures of Acalyptrate flies derive from
a pair of cell primordia known as the eye-antennal imaginal discs. These discs undergo dramatic growth and differentiation during larval and pupal stages, transforming
from a flat sheet of relatively few cells into the eyes,
antenna and head capsule of adult flies. Histological [52]
and fate mapping studies [53] indicate that eye-stalk
development and growth begins in the late larval stage
and continues during pupal development.

Larvae and pupae were harvested from a large outbred laboratory population of Teleopsis dalmanni that was originally collected near the village of Ulu Gombak in
peninsular Malaysia in 1999 [54]. Larvae were reared at
low density in 50 ml of pureed corn and kept in an incubator at 25°C with a 12 h L:D cycle. Eye-antennal discs
and optic lobes were dissected from approximately 200
flies at each of three stages and stored in RNAlater
(Ambion) at -20°C.
Libraries were made from three developmental stages –
late larval flies (L), early pupal flies (P1) and mid-pupal
flies (P2). The larval period was defined as the interval in
which third instar larvae stop feeding, purge their gut and
wander toward a suitable pupation location, early pupation was defined as 0–3 days after initiation of pupation
and mid-pupation was defined as 4–6 days after initiation
of pupation. Total RNA was prepared using an RNA isola-

tion kit (Promega) and RNA quality was verified using an
Agilent bioanalyzer. We then synthesized ds cDNA using
the SMART PCR cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech). The
libraries were constructed following the manufacturer's
protocol except that two different ligation reactions were
performed on size-selected samples. The total cDNA sample was run on an agarose gel and cut into two fragments
corresponding to transcripts above and below 1 kilobase.
These fragments were then purified, precipitated and
ligated into the vector separately. This procedure ensured
that the library did not contain a majority of small inserts
that preferentially ligate into the vector. Averaged across
the three developmental stages, the small insert libraries
had an average insert size of 600 bp and 3.5% of clones
were without an insert, while the large insert libraries had
an average insert size of 1.25 kb and 15% of clones were
without an insert.
Cloned cDNAs were transformed into ElectroMAX
DH10B cells (Invitrogen), and, after growth, the colonies
were picked from bioassay plates using a Q-bot automated colony picker (Genetix) and stored individually in
384-well plates. We sequenced a total of 24,192 cDNAs
(14,976 from the larval library, 3,072 from the early pupal
library and 6,144 from the late pupal library) in both the
5' and 3' directions. Preliminary assessment of library
quality indicated that the larval library had fewer clones
without inserts and higher complexity than the other two
libraries, so the majority of ESTs were sequenced from this
library. Sequencing reactions followed standard JGI protocol
http://www.jgi.doe.gov/sequencing/protocols/
prots_production.html using rolling circle amplification
with TempliPhi ET terminators (Amersham), SPRI reaction clean up, and electorophoretic separation on either a
Megabace 4000 or ABI 3730 × l automated DNA
sequencer.
EST annotation
Clustering of EST reads into consensus sequences was performed by the Joint Genome Institute's EST Analysis Pipeline (see Additional file 1). Base assignment and quality
scores were determined using Phred software [55,56]. Vector, linker, adapter, poly-A/T and other artifact sequences
were removed using the Cross_match software (available
with the Phrap package), and an internally developed
short pattern finder. ESTs shorter than 100 bp were
removed from the data set, as were contaminant
sequences such as E. coli, common vectors and sequencing
standards. Clustering of the remaining ESTs was conducted using a two-step process. In the first step, pairwise
EST alignments were generated using a modified version
of the Smith-Waterman algorithm [57], which was developed at the JGI for use in whole genome shotgun assembly. ESTs with 96% sequence similarity over a span of 100
bp were included in the same cluster. The 5' and 3' reads

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/361

from the same cDNA clone were also combined into the
same cluster. In the second step, all reads within a given
cluster were assembled into consensus sequences using
Phrap [58]. Many clusters contained more than one consensus sequence (referred to as conseqs within the text).
Alternative consensus sequences within a given cluster
typically represented 1) non-overlapping regions of the
same gene, 2) transcript variants of the same gene or 3)
allelic variants of the same gene. Because most conseqs
from a given cluster belonged to the same gene, the functional annotation of the ESTs was organized primarily at
the level of cluster.
All conseqs from the EST database were blasted (using
blastx with a cut-off of 1 × e-9) against the protein databases for Drosophila melanogaster (release 5.6 from FlyBase) and Anopheles gambiae (release AgamP3.49 from
Ensembl) as well as the Genbank non-redundant DNA
and protein databases (nr). Because of the close phylogenetic proximity of T. dalmanni to Drosophila, the D. melanogaster protein and gene information was used as the
default reference for all T. dalmanni annotation (see Additional file 2). All cases in which two conseqs from the
same cluster had different D. melanogaster genes as their
top hit were resolved by examining the e-values of the secondary Blast hits for each conseq. Twenty-seven clusters
contained conseqs that appeared to belong to different
genes and these conseqs were separated in subsequent
annotation. We also blasted (using tblastx) all conseqs
against the D. melanogaster Transposable Element database (version 9.4.1). The largest open reading frame for
each conseq was generated using the GetOrf module in
the Mobyle analysis portal [59].
Gene Ontology annotations for the library as a whole and
for each developmental stage were constructed and compared to each other and to D. melanogaster using GeneMerge [60]. All of the ESTs from a given developmental
stage library were not assembled and annotated separately. Rather, the ESTs for all three libraries were assembled and annotated together and a gene was assigned to a
given developmental stage if a cluster that had a top hit to
that gene contained a sequencing read from at least one
cDNA belonging to that developmental stage library. We
also constructed a list of all genes whose representation in
the EST database was unique to a particular developmental stage. Using GeneMerge, we tested whether genes
belonging to any given GO category were overrepresented
in a particular developmental stage relative to the EST
database as a whole. Representative GO terms were chosen to summarize a single biological process pathway if
several of the terms in a parent/child relationship were
significant.

Paralogous genes assessment
In numerous cases, different clusters contained conseqs
whose top Blast hit was to overlapping regions of the same
D. melanogaster gene. These clusters were candidates for
paralogous gene sets, possibly arising from gene duplication since the lineage split that led to D. melanogaster. To
test this possibility, we aligned all the conseqs with this
condition (a total of 1,389 clusters representing 329
genes) and visually inspected the alignments to determine
why the sequences had not been combined into the same
cluster if they were homologous to the same region in D.
melanogaster. For the majority of genes, the hypothesis of
paralogous gene pairs or sets could be rejected by visual
inspection. Common reasons for their separation into different clusters included 1) mis-splicing (one of the cluster
conseqs retained an intron), 2) alternative transcripts
(sequence similarity broke down at an exon border), 3)
large indels, and 4) UTR variation. For the remaining
genes that showed widespread nucleotide variation across
the protein coding sequence, conseqs were blasted (using
blastx) against the insect genome database in GenBank to
identify homologous transcripts in D. melanogaster, D.
pseudoobscura, A. gambiae and Apis mellifera. In one case,
no homologous protein could be identified in A. gambiae
or A. mellifera so we included additional Drosophila species
in the analysis. All genes within e-20 of the top hit were
retained and aligned with the translations for the T. dalmanni conseqs using ClustalX [61]. Based on these alignments, our criteria for calling a pair or set of conseqs from
different clusters distinct genes was if the amino acid
divergence across homologous regions of the T. dalmanni
conseqs was greater than 10% and if all conseqs and the
top hit gene from D. melanogaster are monophyletic relative to the Anopheles and Apis proteins and other D. melanogaster genes. The phylogenetic relationships among the
proteins were determined using the proml module in the
Phylip v3.68 software package [62] with a JTT model of
change and no rate variation among sites.
Protein evolution
Identifying genes evolving rapidly in the lineage leading
to T. dalmanni relative to their rate of change among other
Dipteran species may provide insight about possible
mechanisms important in the evolution of eye-stalks.
Therefore, we constructed a database of all unique protein
coding data among the T. dalmanni EST sequences to align
with amino acid sequences from Anopheles and Drosophila.
All conseqs belonging to a cluster with a significant Blast
hit to a Drosophila gene were aligned in Sequencher v. 4
(Gene Codes) using the Large Gap assembly algorithm
and a 90% match minimum. All contigs were visually
inspected to ensure proper homology and the consensus
sequences were blasted (using blastx) against the D. melanogaster protein database. These blast results identified
possible frame shifts and intron inclusions because they

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/361

appear as multiple alignments in the Blast output. For all
of these cases, the sequencher contigs were inspected to
confirm the presence of a frame shift or intron and the
affected assemblies were fixed. All open reading frames
larger than 200 bp for each contig were then generated
with GetOrf [59]. The translations for these ORFs were
blasted against the D. melanogaster protein database to
identify which ORF was the true protein coding sequence
(in some cases the largest ORF of a conseq was not the one
with homology to the Drosophila gene). In a few cases, two
ORFs from a single conseq had significant hits to different
D. melanogaster gene. This resulted from the genes sharing
UTR sequence (in the majority of cases the genes are adjacent in D. melanogaster) and, therefore, being clustered
together during assembly. Both ORFs were retained for
analysis.
Overall, this methodology produced a total of 4,450
unique, non-overlapping protein sequences corresponding to 3,230 genes in D. melanogaster. All protein
sequences were then aligned to homologous regions in A.
gambiae, D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura and D. virilis.
The three Drosophila species were chosen to span the full
range of evolutionary relationships within the genus.
Homologous protein sequences in Drosophila were
obtained from the 12 Drosophila species analysis ftp site
ftp://ftp.flybase.net/genomes/12_species_analysis/
clark_eisen/alignments/ and from Ensembl BioMart for
the A. gambiae homologous proteins.
Each of the 4,450 unique T. dalmanni protein sequences
was aligned to its D. melanogaster homolog using JAligner,
which implements the Smith-Waterman [57] pairwise
local alignment algorithm with Gotoh's [63] improvement. Columns containing leading and trailing gaps in
the T. dalmanni sequence were removed from the alignment. Poorly aligned regions at each end were further
trimmed using an alignment quality score method
described in Wu et al. [64], and modified for amino acid
sequences by incorporating the BLOSUM62 matrix. A
multiple sequence alignment was then built using
HMMER v2.3.2 [65], aligning the homologous sequences
in T. dalmanni, A. gambiae, D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura (or D. persimillis) and D. virilis (or D. mojavensis) to
each profile HMM. Multiple protein sequences that correspond to a single gene in D. melanogaster were concatenated prior to further analysis. Alignments are provided as
supplemental material (see Additional file 3). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the PhyML software
package [66] using PhyML with the JTT substitution
model with no invariant sites, constraining the topology
to be ((Dv,(Dm, Dp)), Td, Ag), and optimizing branch
lengths and rate parameters.

To estimate the rate of relative divergence in the T. dalmanni lineage relative to the other dipteran species, we
calculated the percentage of the entire tree length comprised by the branch leading to T. dalmanni (see Additional file 4). Thus, the higher the percentage, the faster
that gene was evolving in the lineage leading to T. dalmanni relative to the Drosophila and A. gambiae lineages.
This statistic was used as input data in the program
ErmineJ [67] to determine if genes belonging to a given
Biological Process category are evolving significantly
faster or slower than expected based on the entire distribution of relative branch lengths for all genes in the EST
database. This program uses a resampling technique in
which the mean values for a given statistic (T. dalmanni
relative branch lengths in this study) for each Biological
Process category is compared to a distribution of resampled mean values and uses a Benjamini-Hochberg correction of p-values. We implemented the 'Gene score
resampling' option, with a negative log transformation for
all Biological Process categories that had more than 10
and less than 200 representatives. We also conducted pairwise relative rate tests on individual genes as implemented in HyPhy [68].
Microarray Analysis
Slide Construction
Microarray slides were constructed for all clusters in the
EST database that had 1) significant sequence identity to
known genes in Drosophila or Anopheles, 2) an ORF larger
than 300 bp or 3) more than four cDNA clones associated
with that cluster. Using Agilent software, we designed
three 60-mer oligonucleotides for each gene based on the
entire EST sequence for the conseq with the highest Blast
hit or largest ORF within each cluster. We then had slides
with four 44,000-feature arrays containing this probe
group synthesized by Agilent. Each probe was spotted in
triplicate on the slide.
Hybridization and analysis of expression
As a first step towards identifying genes that influence relative eye-stalk length we compared gene expression
between lines of flies that have been under artificial sexual
selection to increase or decrease male eye span for 65 generations [27,28,30]. We compared gene expression
between male flies from the high (H2) and low (L2) lines
that deviated furthest from the average control lines. At
the time of these experiments H2 male eyespan was 9.36
± 0.07 mm and L2 male eyespan was 7.39 ± 0.07 mm,
which represents a difference of 5.7 s.d. between these two
lines.

To minimize developmental variation in gene expression
we collected tissue from wandering larvae just prior to
pupation. Two lines of evidence indicate that eye-stalk
development begins at this time. By staining larval and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/361

pupal sections, Buschbeck et al. [52] showed that the eye
discs begin rapid cell growth during the pre-pupal period.
In addition, application of synthetic juvenile hormone
(methoprene) to pre-pupal flies caused a significant shift
in male eyespan to body length allometry in adult flies
[69], indicating that eye-stalk expression can be influenced by hormone titers in wandering larvae. Therefore,
we collected imaginal disc and brain tissue from wandering larvae just after gut purge. To recognize larvae without
food in their digestive tract we reared larvae on food that
had been dyed with green food color. Using this technique, gut-purged larvae have transparent, instead of
green, digestive tracts.
Larvae were dissected in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
and the larval cuticle was inverted from each end to
expose genital and eye discs. Male larvae were identified
by genital disc morphology and their eye discs, optic lobes
and brains were removed and submerged in RNAlater
solution (Ambion) and stored at -20°. Total RNA was
extracted from disc and brain tissue using an RNA isolation kit (Promega). Each biological sample consisted of
twenty-five sets of eye discs that were homogenized by
grinding with plastic pestles in 175 μl lysis buffer. After
treating with DNase I enzyme, RNA was concentrated by
lyophilization and the quality of each sample was checked
with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. Only high-quality RNA
samples (RNA integrity above 7) were selected for the
experiments. A total of eight pairs of samples were used in
this experiment.
We used the Ovation amino allyl RNA amplification kit
(NuGen) to amplify messenger RNA prior to labeling.
This procedure uses reverse transcription to make singlestranded cDNA and then DNA polymerization to make
double-stranded (ds) cDNA. The ds cDNA is then amplified using a linear amplification procedure. Samples were
alternately labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 dyes using an amino
allyl cDNA labeling kit (Ambion) with regard to source of
selection line and then hybridized to an oligoarray using
an Agilent rotator rack and oven. After hybridization,
slides were scanned at 5 μm resolution using a Genepix
4200A scanner.
Gene expression was measured from array images
scanned at each dye wavelength using the commercial
software program, Genepix Pro (see Additional file 5).
Features were excluded from further analysis if the majority of pixels were saturated, the spot was noncircular, or if
the squared correlation between channels was less than
0.3. Median intensity ratios were normalized to remove
dye bias without subtracting background using MIDAS
software developed by The Institute for Genome Research
(TIGR). Intensity ratios for dye-swapped samples were
inverted and the hypothesis of no differential expression

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:361

was tested for each gene by SAM [70] using MeV software
from TIGR. Genes were excluded from testing if data from
fewer than four arrays were available for analysis, which
left 3,105 genes. We analyzed the data in two ways: using
the log-ratio expression intensity for each oligo as an independent observation and using the average log-ratio of all
oligos for each gene. Many of the same genes were identified as being differentially expressed by both methods, so
we report only the results from the average oligo analysis.
With 8 replicate arrays, significance for each gene is
assessed using 256 permutations. Significance was
assigned for any gene with a q-value of 0 [71]. We used the
d-statistic, which measures the standardized difference
between the mean log-ratios for the eight replicate arrays
and zero, to rank order the degree of bias in expression for
each gene. The microarray data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression
Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession
number GSE15444.
Functional analysis of the log-ratios was conducted using
GeneMerge [60] and ErmineJ [67]. With GeneMerge, the
set of genes showing significant differential expression
(either in total or just the up-regulated and down-regulated sets) was compared to all the genes on the microarray slide to identify GO categories with significant overrepresentation within the set of differentially expressed
genes. With ErmineJ, the d-statistic for all the genes with
detectable expression values was converted to a measure
varying between 0 and 1 and used as input to determine if
any GO categories had significantly larger or smaller
mean d-statistic values than an average gene set of similar
size. In this program, we implemented the 'Gene score
resampling' option, with a negative log transformation for
all Biological Process categories that had more than 10
and less than 200 representatives.
Quantitative rtPCR
To validate the microarray results we used quantitative
reverse transcriptase PCR (qrtPCR) to quantify relative
expression of eight genes identified as exhibiting differential expression. The eight genes were Baldspot, CG11577,
CG30390, Lamin, M-spondin, ORF-102, Ornithine aminotransferase precursor, and prominin-like. Primer design
and optimization was done with Beacon Designer 7.0
software (Baldspot: 5'-ACTTCAGTTACTTTGTGCTATTCG3', 5'-CTCCGCCGCCATTTGC-3'; CG11577: 5'-GTGGTGCTGAGGAGAAAGAAG-3', 5'-ATTCACTGCGTCGGTATTCG-3'; CG30390: 5'-GCTTATGCGGATGAAACAC-3', 5'TCAGATGGCTATACAGAACC-3'; Lamin: 5'-CGACAAGGTCTAAGCGTTC-3', 5'-GGCGAGTTGGACTTAATGG-3';
M-spondin: 5'-CAATAAATGGTGTTGGCAATCAGC-3', 5'TTCTCCGTTCGCCGTGTTG-3'; ORF-102: 5'-TTGGCTCGCAGACATCTACC-3', 5'-CGTCCGTGGGCATAAGGG-3';

5'-CCTGGCATGAATGGACCGAATC-3';
prominin-like:
5'CATCAGTGCCGCTGTCAAC-3', 5'-ATTTCTCGGTTTCCTGCTCATAC-3'). The annealing temperature of RT-PCR
was optimized in a gradient cycler. First stand cDNA synthesis was performed using 0.5 μg of total RNA and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in 20 μl
according to the manufacturer's instructions. The product
of reverse transcription was diluted 5 fold for PCR. Realtime quantitative PCR was performed using a Lightcycler
480 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and SYBR Green I.
Briefly, 1 μl of first stand cDNA reaction was amplified by
each primer pair in a 20 μl reaction containing 7 μl water,
1 μl forward primer (10 μM), 1 μl backward primer (10
μM), 10 μl Lightcycler DNA Master Mix SYBR Green I (2×)
(Roche). The amplification reaction consisted of 45 cycles
of denaturation at 94°C (10 seconds), annealing at 60°C
(10 seconds), and extension at 70°C (10 seconds). Fluorescent measurements were obtained once in each cycle
by sequential fluorescence monitoring of each sample
tube at the end of extension. A fractional cycle number or
crossing point (CP) was determined from the exponential
phase of the fluorescence amplification profiles using the
second derivative maximum function of the Roche Lightcycler 480 basic software. Expression of the housekeeping
gene GAPDH-2 was used to standardize the amount of
input cDNA in each reaction (primers: 5'-ATCGGACGCTTGGTTCTC-3', 5'-TACGGTGCCCTTGAAACG3'). Once the GAPDH-2 CP was determined for each
cDNA sample, it was used to normalize all other genes
tested from the same sample. GAPDH-2 was chosen for
normalization because this gene exhibited high levels of
expression but no evidence of biased expression among
the selected line microarrays (average ± SE log-ratio = 0.09 ± 0.06) or between males and females across the
developmental stages used in constructing the EST libraries (results not shown). Calculation of fold increase and
decrease in expression of target genes relative to expression levels of GAPDH was accomplished using the 2-ΔΔCT
method [72]. Four biological replicates were used for each
selected line.
