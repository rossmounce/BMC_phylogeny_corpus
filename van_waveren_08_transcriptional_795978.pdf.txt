Abstract
Background: The mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is critical for energy
(ATP) production in eukaryotic cells. It was previously shown that genes coding for mitochondrial
proteins involved in energy production co-express at the RNA level. Because the OXPHOS
enzymes are multimeric complexes, we tested the hypothesis that genes coding for components of
specific complexes are also co-regulated at the transcriptional level, and share common regulatory
elements in their promoters.
Results: We observed for the first time that, not only OXPHOS genes as a group co-express, but
there is a co-expression of genes within each of the five OXPHOS enzyme complexes, showing a
higher degree of complexity in gene co-regulation. In silico analysis of homologous promoter
sequences in mammals identified the likely core promoter elements for most genes encoding
OXPHOS subunits/assembly factors. The results included a significant abundance of previously
identified sites (e.g. NRF1, NRF2, ERRA and YY1), as well as several sites that had not been
previously detected. Although we identified patterns that correlated to OXPHOS gene expression,
we did not detect an OXPHOS complex-specific arrangement of transcription factor binding sites
within the core promoter that could explain the tight co-expression of these functionally related
genes.
Conclusion: This study mapped the core promoters of most OXPHOS related genes and
provided an example of gene expression regulation based on the final protein arrangement within
a linear metabolic pathway.

Background
The oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) is
responsible for 90% of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
production in a respiring cell. Five multi-subunit complexes, the respiratory chain complexes, and two additional electron carriers, coenzyme Q10 and cytochrome c,
participate in OXPHOS to generate ATP [1]. The OXPHOS
complexes consist of proteins encoded by both the

nuclear (n = approximately 100 in humans) and the mitochondrial DNA (n = 13). Complex I is apparently made
up of 38 nuclear coded and 7 mtDNA coded subunits, 4
nDNA coded subunits make up mature complex II, complex III contains 11 subunits one of which is mtDNA
coded, complex IV contains 13 subunits, 3 are mtDNA
coded and complex V is made up of 2 mtDNA coded and
15 nDNA coded subunits (Figure 1A). In addition, several

nuclear-coded assembly factors that are not part of the
mature complex and coded by the nDNA, have been
shown to be necessary for the proper assembly and function of the OXPHOS system. Consequently, the correct
function of the respiratory chain depends on an orchestrated crosstalk between the two genomes [2-4].
Microarray data have been widely used to study gene coexpression by studying genes with similar expression patterns across a set of samples. Over the past few years, several lines of evidence suggest that co-expressed genes
(which display high correlation values (CV) amongst different expression experiments) are likely to encode proteins that participate in the same metabolic pathway, form
a common structural complex, or might be regulated by
the same mechanism [5,6].
In eukaryotes, the regulatory mechanisms underlying coregulation of multiple genes is extremely complex [7]. At
the mRNA level, co-expression of OXPHOS genes has
become evident from recent studies of wide transcriptome
analysis across and within different species. In humans,
large-scale analysis across different tissues (Shyamsundar
et al. 2005) and across multiple datasets and conditions
[8] have revealed a co-expression cluster significantly
enriched in OXPHOS genes. In mouse, co-expression of
OXPHOS genes across different tissues has been also
described [9]. Lastly, two macroevolutionary studies have
also observed that several biological functional groups
were repeatedly identified as co-expressed over large evolutionary distances and a wide variety of conditions. One
of these clusters was significantly enriched in OXPHOS
genes [10,11]. Hence, it became apparent that a significant number of genes involved in the energy generation
pathway, and in particular OXPHOS, not only share the
same metabolic pathway (ATP synthesis) and interact at a
protein-level, but also share tight co-expression at the
mRNA level within and across different conditions and
organisms. This suggests that these genes might have a
common regulatory mechanism that accounts for this
striking pattern of co-expression.

transcription of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes as
well as factors regulating mitochondrial transcription.
Recent evidence points to both transcription factors (TFs)
and transcriptional coactivators as important players in
the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. DNA-binding
TFs including nuclear-respiratory factor 1 and 2 (NRF1,
NRF2) estrogen related receptor alpha (ERRA), Sp1, ying
yang 1 (YY1), CREB and E-box factors have all been implicated in the expression of some nuclear-coded respiratory
chain subunits, among other genes [13-15]. Transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor gamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1α) and related family members (PGC-1β and PRC) are coactivators known to
interact with NRF1, NRF2 and ERRA stimulating the
expression of several OXPHOS genes [16-20]. PGC-1α
was identified as a coactivator involved in mitochondrial
gene regulation during adaptive thermogenesis in brown
adipose tissue [21]. PGC-1α is mainly expressed in tissues
with high energy demand and high mitochondrial content, such as heart, brain, kidney and brown fat, and is
induced by fasting and exposure to cold [21-25]. Overexpression of PGC-1α induces the expression of a vast
amount of genes participating in mitochondrial metabolism including the TFs ERRA and NRF2 [14,26]. On the
other hand, PGC-1β was shown to regulate the expression
of various OXPHOS genes as well as NRF1 and ERRA [27].
Therefore, PGC-1α and PGC-1β could play a role as master regulators of the respiratory capacity of a cell either by
physically interacting with ERRA, NRF1 and NRF2 at the
promoters of OXPHOS-related genes or by increasing the
expression of these transcription factors. However, while
these TFs and coactivators directly regulate OXPHOS
genes, it is unclear how they are integrated in response to
environmental cues.

Energetic demands vary substantially between different
cells and tissues of an organism. For example, in mammals, the mitochondrial content of cardiac myocytes or
brown adipose cells is very high compared to skeletal
muscle fibers type IIb. In general, the energy demand of a
specific tissue correlates with the level of expression of
genes encoding components of the OXPHOS system [12].
The mechanisms controlling this nucleo-mitochondrial
communication are just starting to emerge.

The main conclusion we can draw from the above is that
the expression of OXPHOS genes can be modulated at the
transcriptional level. There is mounting evidence to show
that TFs and coactivators, particularly PGC-1α, are able to
cooperatively alter the expression of OXPHOS genes.
Although OXPHOS gene expression can be regulated at
different levels, gene expression is likely to be a major
determinant for coordinated expression. Therefore,
understanding the complete set of TFs and coactivators
that regulate OXPHOS gene expression should yield
insights into the control of OXPHOS gene expression regulation. Although significant progress has been made in
this respect, a complete list of factors regulating the
expression of all OXPHOS genes remains incomplete, and
how these regulators are integrated under physiological
conditions is poorly understood.

There are diverse regulatory mechanisms that may underlie co-expression. However, most studies have been
devoted to the identification of proteins that regulate the

In this study, OXPHOS gene co-expression across different
tissues in humans and mice was confirmed in an independent large microarray dataset. Detailed analyses

showed that subunits of individual complexes co-express
preferentially among each other than with subunits of
other complexes. In addition, phylogenetic footprinting
across human, mouse and rat, helped to define each
OXPHOS gene core promoter, and resulted in a comprehensive list of factors that could participate in their transcriptional control.

Results
Most OXPHOS genes are co-expressed across humans and
mouse normal tissues
From various genome wide expression studies, a significant group of OXPHOS genes appears to be co-expressed
under various physiological conditions in several species.
To identify which particular OXPHOS genes are coexpressed in different conditions/species, we obtained the
complete microarray dataset of human and mouse from
the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF) tissue compendium. Using custom-designed
whole-genome gene expression arrays from panels of
mRNAs derived from 79 human and 61 mouse tissues and
cell types performed in duplicates, this compendium evaluates the relative expression of 44,775 human and 36,182
mouse transcripts [28]. Analyzing all transcripts would
incorporate significant noise to the analysis, thus data was
subjected to global normalization and filtered for a compilation of mitochondria-related genes that contains all
mitochondrial transcripts coding for mitochondrial proteins, as well as transcripts coding for OXPHOS related
factors such as those involved in oxidative stress response,
fatty acid biosynthesis and glycolysis (see methods).

In order to study co-expression of OXPHOS genes among
all the human and mouse "mitochondrial genelists", an
unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis was performed.
This approach was used to visualize relationships among
the expression patterns of OXPHOS genes and other
groups of genes. Figure 1b shows the result of the hierarchical clustering analysis using Pearson correlation similarity measure of the filtered genes. Genes are displayed
on the horizontal axis and tissues on the vertical axis. The
nodes that have genes that are enriched in a particular biological pathway are represented on the right side of each
tree. The ordered list of genes based on Figure 1b is
described on Additional file 1.
In both mice and humans, the hierarchical tree cluster
analysis resulted in a cluster of genes enriched in
OXPHOS genes. These results confirm previous observations that a significant number of OXPHOS genes share a
common pattern of gene expression across different tissues and this co-expression is conserved across different
species. Other gene groups that were significantly coexpressed among different tissues correspond to genes
coding for fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, oxidative stress

response, mitochondrial translation machinery, mitochondrial chaperone activity, glycolysis and calcium binding. Tissue clustering showed that tissues with high or low
expression of OXPHOS genes clustered together. Tissues
with known high energy consumption such as heart, skeletal muscle, kidney and liver displayed increased expression of OXPHOS genes compared to tissues with lower
energy demand such as skin and lung. This pattern of
expression was observed for other mitochondrial genes as
well, which suggests that tissues with high energy demand
have not only an increase in the expression of energy generating genes but also of other mitochondrial components. These proteins may be necessary to structurally and
metabolically sustain increased energy production.
Subunits of each complex tend to have tighter coexpression with subunits of the same complex than with
subunits of other complexes
The above study suggests that a significant number of
OXPHOS subunits co-express among different tissues in
both mouse and humans. Next, we studied if particular
members of each respiratory complex co-express among
each other preferentially over subunits/assembly factors
of other OXPHOS complexes. To address this issue, an
"OXPHOS correlation test" was designed (please refer to
the methods section for a full explanation of this test).
Briefly, a similarity matrix was created for all OXPHOS
genes (Figure 2a). Next, the correlation values were
ordered vertically and assigned to each complex (shaded
in Figure 2aii). A cutoff of the 30% highest ranking genes
was set. Next, for each gene (columns in Figure 2b), the
percentage of factors belonging to each complex within
the cutoff was calculated. Lastly, a Student's T-test was performed to test the null hypothesis that 'each gene has the
same percentage of complex "X" factors within the cutoff'.
Figure 2b shows a graphical view in which genes coding
for complex I subunits (CI, top left), have more genes with
high correlation values belonging to complex I (white
squares) than any other complex. The same positive correlation can be seen for complex V subunits (Figure 2c,
top right). This method is somehow similar to the "mitochondrial neighborhood" index used by Mootha and colleagues [29]. The similarity matrix is presented on
Additional file 2.

Table 1 shows the summary of the results obtained for all
the four datasets. Although the results for each dataset varied slightly, overall subunits of complex I and V co-express
preferentially with themselves. For all complexes, the
average of the percentage of subunits from a complex was
higher within genes of the same complex than genes of
other complexes. In addition, there seems to be a trend in
which subunits of complex II and IV also behave in a similar manner (in most cases, the complex II or IV subunits
had a higher average percentage of subunits from their

Preferential co-expression of genes belonging to the same OXPHOS complex. (a) (i) Pearson correlation values (PCV) were calculated
between the expression patterns of each OXPHOS subunit against all the others. In this example, the PCV for complex I subunits are coded white and the
rest in black. For simplicity, the PCV of one complex I subunit (vertical) against all the others OXPHOS subunits are shown. (ii) Next, for each subunit (on
the vertical axis), the genes were vertically ordered by their PCV values. A 30% cutoff was selected to calculate the percentage of Complex I subunits (in
this example) over all other subunits within this cutoff. In this case, 35% of genes in the 30% cutoff are complex I subunits. (b) Schematic representation of
the vertically ordered PCV for all OXPHOS subunits coded for each complex I subunit (each vertical line). The same approach was repeated for all other
OXPHOS subunits. Notice, the top left quadrant (30% most similar genes to complex I subunits) there is a higher likelihood of finding complex I subunits
(white) than subunits belonging to any other complex (black). (c) The same analysis but in this case for complex V subunits. See table 1 for a statistical analysis of these diagrams.

own complex within the cutoff than in subunits from any
other complex (asterisk on Table 1). However, these
trends did not reach statistical significance because of the
few genes representing these complexes (for example,
complex II is only represented by 3–4 subunits). Therefore, to bypass this limitation, we grouped the results
obtained from all the datasets and performed the statistical test on the combined data. In this way, we obtained
significant evidence that genes coding for a particular
OXPHOS complex co-express preferentially with genes of
the same complex. Statistical significance was not reached
for complex III, although a trend was observed.
This analysis showed that although OXPHOS subunits coexpress among themselves within and across species, gene
members coding for each multimeric complex also coexpress preferentially with members of the same complex.
This novel observation suggests that there is a higher
degree of complexity in OXPHOS gene regulation than
had been so far detected.

Promoter Analysis of OXPHOS Genes
From the above study it is apparent that OXPHOS genes
co-express at a tissue level. This raises the hypothesis that
these genes have a common co-regulatory mechanism
that allows co-expression among different tissues. Previous studies suggest that transcriptional initiation is the
most common form of gene regulation of OXPHOS genes
[30]. However, a comprehensive study of transcriptional
regulation of OXPHOS genes has not been performed
until now. Most studies concentrate on the characterization of one or a few number of OXPHOS gene promoters
and are limited to only one species. Therefore, in this
study, an exhaustive analysis of all OXPHOS gene promoters in human, mouse and rat was performed. Promoter analysis was performed for all known nuclear
coded OXPHOS structural subunits and assembly factors,
as well as 130 randomly selected mitochondrial genes. All
available promoter sequences from human, mouse and
rat were extracted for all genes analyzed. These species
were chosen because their genomes are divergent enough

We observed a co-expression for genes within the same complex at a tissue level. The table shows the results of the OXPHOS correlation test for
different mouse and human tissue microarray datasets. 'All datasets' represent the results obtained by grouping all the datasets. T-test p-values
represent the probability that genes within each complex do not preferentially co-express with genes of its same complex. 'Complex' percentage
values represent the average percentage of genes of each complex that have expression similarities within 30% cutoff to genes in the complex
labeled above. 'ALL the rest' represent the average percentage of genes within each complex that have expression patterns within the first 30%
similarity in genes of any other complex. The 'Number of genes' represent the number of genes representing that complex in each microarray
dataset. Asterisks, show cases in which the statistical test did not reach the significant cutoff but showed a trend of higher average percentages in
subunits of the same complex than all the rest.

for phylogenetic footprinting analysis to be performed, as
they still display high sequence conservation and are the
best annotated. An example of phylogenetic footprinting
is described on the Additional file 3. For this study, core
promoter regions were defined as DNA sequences 500 bp
upstream and downstream of the transcription start site
(TSS). Analyzing sequences that were larger than 500 bp
around the TSS resulted in a significant amount of noise
related to promoters of neighboring genes. In addition,
previous studies suggest that TFBS which are close to the
TSS (~300 bp), are more likely to participate in transcription initiation [31,32]. The complete phylogenetic footprinting alignments of the different OXPHOS
polypeptides, highlighting the conserved regions, can be
found in additional files (Core Promoter Additional files
4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
Respiration is a vital process in essentially every eukaryotic cell, thus OXPHOS genes are considered housekeeping
genes and are expressed in all cell types. In vertebrates,
CpG islands are usually associated with several house-

keeping gene promoters. We tested for the presence of
CpG islands in all human OXPHOS subunit promoters.
Overall, CpG islands are present in the promoter regions
of 83 out of the 101 human OXPHOS genes analyzed.
Since during the course of evolution GC dinucleotides are
usually lost, this analysis suggests that there is a high evolutionary pressure for sequence conservation of OXPHOS
promoter sequences, and these conserved stretches of
DNA probably reflect important transcriptional regulatory elements, and possible nucleosome positioning that
would contribute to transcriptional regulation [33].
A hallmark of several OXPHOS promoters studied until
now is the absence of a typical TATA box adjacent to the
TSS. These promoters are called TATA-less [13]. The TATA
box is recognized by the constitutive transcription factor
TBP (TATA box binding protein). Therefore, in order to
analyze all OXPHOS promoters for the presence of a TATA
box, all homologous promoters were aligned using DiAlignTF (Genomatix) and searched for conserved TBP binding sites within 100 bp of the TSS. Only 23% of OXPHOS

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:18

promoters have conserved TBP binding sites in this
region. These results confirm and extend previous observations that nuclear coded OXPHOS gene promoters are
mostly TATA-less.
OXPHOS genes have common TF binding sites in their
promoters
From our studies as well as others previously published,
the fact that OXPHOS genes are coregulated is clear.
Therefore, with the assumption that functionally important TFBS are conserved across evolution, searching for
conserved TFBS in OXPHOS promoters would probably
result in important information on the molecular basis of
OXPHOS transcriptional regulation.

To search for conserved TFBS, phylogenetic footprinting
was performed on human, mouse and rat orthologous
promoters for all OXPHOS genes. Using DialignTF
(Genomatix, DE), orthologue promoter sequences were
aligned and strings of short-bp similarity (typically found
in TFBS) were searched against a database of known TFBS.
The most abundant TFBS families identified belong to TFs
previously linked to transcription of some OXPHOS
genes: ETSF (Human and murine ETS1 factors) which
includes NRF2, SP1F (GC-Box factors SP1/GC), NRF1,
EREF (Estrogen response elements) which includes ERRA
TFBS, CREB (cAMP-responsive element binding proteins)
and YY1F (Activator/repressor binding to transcription
initiation site). We also identified TFs known to regulate
housekeeping genes, such as EGRF (EGR/nerve growth
factor induced protein C & related factors), ZBPF (Zinc
binding protein factors) and EBOX (E-box binding factors) among others. Please refer to supplementary material (Additional file 9) for a complete list of results. ETSF
belongs to the ETS family of transcription factors and participates in the transcriptional regulation of a myriad of
genes [34]. NRF2 is a member of the ETS family, however
to differentiate true NRF2 binding sites in the promoters
of OXPHOS genes, NRF2 was analyzed also as an independent TFBS. NRF1 and ERRA, as previously described,
have been implicated in the regulation of transcription of
various mitochondrial genes among others. SP1 is a ubiquitous transcription factor expressed in almost every cell.
It has been shown to be necessary for the transcription of
some TATA-less promoters and is an important component of the eukaryotic cellular transcriptional machinery
[35,36]. In human promoters, SP1 and EBOX transcription factor binding sites are recognized by the transcription factors NF-Y, SP1, and USF which are known to be
constitutive TFs participating in basal gene transcription
[31]. Our promoter analysis identified a high percentage
of promoters with these TFBS conserved in OXPHOS
genes. Since OXPHOS genes are housekeeping genes,
these TFBS might have a role in basal transcription initiation. EGRF belongs to the family of TFs involved in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/18

transcription of immediate-early gene products expressed
in response to diverse stimuli [37]. YY1 is also a ubiquitous TF that has been implicated in the transcription of
TATA-less promoters and regulates the transcriptional initiation of several mitochondrial genes [36]. The transcriptional repressor, ZBPF, binds elements found
predominantly in genes that participate in lipid metabolism as well as several genes involved in processes related
to energy metabolism and vascular disease [38]. CREB
family of TFBS belongs to the cAMP response element
(CRE) (recognized by CREB, ATF1, FOS/JUN and ATF2/
JUN heterodimers), which are widely distributed TF families and known to regulate the expression of various unrelated genes. However, OXPHOS genes have been shown
to be regulated by CREB under certain physiological conditions [30,39]. Therefore, an enrichment of this family of
TFBS among OXPHOS subunits is not surprising.
NRF1, NRF2, YY1 and ERRA correspond to TFs that have
been previously linked to the expression of some
OXPHOS genes. To compare the data obtained by the in
silico approach used in this study with experimentally verified TFBS, we searched for studies in which functional
analysis of these TFBS were performed in OXPHOS promoters. In many cases, less stringent DialignTF parameters
identified sites that showed a functional effect on transcription in the literature. For this reason, and only for this
comparison, all promoters were analyzed using less stringent parameters ('SEL' mode in Additional file 9). 23 out
of 27 experimentally verified sites found in the literature
could be predicted by our in silico analysis showing a high
degree of concordance between both methods (see Additional file 10). This analysis showed that the in silico
approach used in this study is able to identify functional
TFBS studied in vivo.
In order to test if the most abundant TFBS identified are
enriched in promoters of OXPHOS genes over other promoters, we tested if the presence of TFBSs correlated with
co-expressed OXPHOS genes. As a premise, we assumed
that co-expression of genes should correlate with the presence of particular TFBS in their promoter. For this analysis, phylogenetic footprinting results from all OXPHOS
subunits as well as other randomly selected mitochondrial genes participating in various metabolic processes
were used. A nonparametric test was designed to check if
genes with a particular conserved TFBS have a higher
probability of having an 'OXPHOS expression pattern'. A
p-value less than 0.05 would suggest an association
between that particular TFBS and OXPHOS expression
pattern (see methods). NRF1, ERRA, YY1 and CREB TFBSs
showed a statistically significant enrichment in OXPHOS
co-expressing gene promoters in both human and mouse
tissues (Figure 3). A previous study, usinga different
approach, identified ERRA and NRF2 as a regulator of

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:18

OXPHOS genes through PGC-1α. In our study, NRF2
TFBS seemed to correlate with OXPHOS co-expressing
genes in human tissues but did not reach statistical significance in mouse tissues using the datasets chosen (Figure
3). Mostly, the TFBSs identified in our study are associated
to TFs that have previously been reported in promoters of
some OXPHOS subunits [30]. Furthermore, these TFBS

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/18

might play a role in the differential expression of
OXPHOS genes across different tissues.
Overall, these results show that phylogenetic footprinting
resulted in the detection of several TFBS that are enriched
in OXPHOS gene promoters. Some TFBS that displayed a
high abundance in OXPHOS gene promoters, like SP1F,
did not show an association with OXPHOS gene expression, which suggests that they might participate in nonspecialized basal transcriptional initiation of these genes.
The vast majority of the OXPHOS promoters analyzed
have not been characterized previously. Therefore, these
results confirm that the unbiased computational
approach chosen does lead to biologically relevant information.
Conserved TFBS Show Positional Bias around the TSS
A fundamental question in a bioinformatics approach to
promoter analysis is to determine which of the predicted
TFBSs are biologically relevant. In the above study, the
presence of a TFBS conserved across human, mouse and
rat was taken as a guide to answer this question. In addition, the relative position of each conserved TFBS to the
corresponding TSS can also be analyzed. Previous studies
have relied on this approach, and found that TFBS that
cluster relative to the TSS (i.e. with a positional bias) have
a high likelihood of being biologically significant [31].

Figure 3
TFBS enriched in OXPHOS gene promoters
TFBS enriched in OXPHOS gene promoters. All genes, whose promoters were analyzed, were ordered by Pearson's correlation similarity to
the expression pattern of an 'artificial gene' (the median of the expression
pattern of OXPHOS genes) (see methods). Each gene was annotated for
the presence of a particular TFBS in its promoter (black horizontal lines).
A nonparametric statistics test was used to test if genes that contained a
particular TFBS in their promoter ranked higher in the list. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) of each TFBS family is shown at the bottom (marked as
significant or not significant). Statistical significance suggests an association
between that TFBS and OXPHOS expression pattern. Human (top) and
mouse (bottom) GNF datasets were used.

Following this idea, the positional bias of each TFBS relative to the TSS was recorded. Although the analysis covered 500 bp surrounding the TSS (500 bp upstream and
downstream), the conserved TFBS identified by phylogenetic footprinting preferentially occur within ~150 bases
of the TSS in all three organisms, consistent with the likelihood of these TFBS being involved in transcription initiation (Figure 4). Previous studies performed in a whole
genome approach have shown that NRF1, ETS, NRF2,
SP1, EBOX, ECAT and CREB TFBS cluster close to the promoter region in humans [31]. ERRA TFBS seemed to be
present preferentially downstream of the TSS in OXPHOS
gene promoters. In addition, they tend to cluster around
200 and 350 bp downstream of the TSS. Previous studies
had not been able to detect a positional bias for ERRA
TFBS [40]. Few conserved TFBS were observed outside 300
bp around the TSS, confirming that a 500 bp around the
TSS has been a reasonable cutoff to obtain biologically relevant results with low noise.
Taking a closer look around the TSS it became apparent
that YY1F TFBS are preferentially conserved at the TSS or
around 10 bp of it, suggesting a strong role in transcription initiation of OXPHOS genes (Figure 4b). On the
other hand, NRF1, NRF2 and ETSF and SP1F TFBSs cluster
slightly upstream of the TSS (~50–70 bp upstream of the
TSS). Each TFBS clusters in slightly different positions

within 150 bp upstream of the TSS. This raises the possibility that these factors function together in transcriptional regulation.
In summary, there seems to be a clear positional bias
around the TSS for the most abundant TFBS identified by
phylogenetic footprinting. In particular, known OXPHOS
related TFs, NRF1, NRF2 and YY1F (except ERRA) all cluster within ~150 bp of the TSS. This suggests that most conserved TFBS identified for OXPHOS promoters are
probably transcriptionally functional in humans, mouse
and rat, and raises the possibility that TFBS identified outside of this region might not be functional for the promoters of these ubiquitously expressed genes studied. These

results further support the biological relevance of our in
silico approach.
TFBS Orientation on OXPHOS promoters
From previous studies, most TFs do not have a preferred
orientation of binding in order to play a role in transcription initiation. To test this in OXPHOS promoters, TFBS
orientation was recorded for all conserved TFBS detected
in all three species. YY1F and EGRF families of TFBS
showed a statistically significant (p < 0.05) bias towards
one strand of DNA (Figure 5). Particularly, YY1F presented a clear bias to bind the negative strand. Since YY1F
TFBS also presents a strong positional bias to the TSS (~50
nucleotides around the TSS), these results suggest that
YY1F TFBSs might play an important role in TSS determi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/18

that there must be an intricate mechanism of co-regulation of these genes at the mRNA level.

nation of these TATA-less promoters as well as in transcriptional initiation. ERRA and NRF2 TFBSs also seem to
have a preferred orientation; however, they did not reach
statistical significance. A strand bias for the two latter factors has previously been reported for mitochondrial genes
[14].

Discussion
The coordinate regulation of the expression of gene
groups can occur at different levels, such as transcription
[14] or translation [41,42]. In this study, we focused on
the coordinated regulation of mRNA levels of genes
related to OXPHOS function. Our results clearly show the
power of in silico approach to define promoter regions and
to study gene co-expression and co-regulation at a transcriptional level. Combining high-throughput gene
expression data with promoter analysis has enabled the
detection of sites that are recognized by unique or families
of TFs which might play an important role in the coexpression of OXPHOS genes. Although previous studies
have shown the co-expression and defined TFBS for genes
coding for mitochondrial proteins [14,26], in this study
we focused on OXPHOS-related genes.
From our gene expression studies, we were able to confirm
co-expression of OXPHOS genes at the mRNA level.
OXPHOS genes are known as housekeeping genes, and it
would be expected that they are transcribed at similar levels in all cell types. However, there is a clear difference in
relative mRNA abundance of a significant number of
these genes, mostly related to the energy requirements of
each tissue. Although differences in the number, size and
protein content of mitochondria from different tissues is
a recognized aspect in the field, differences in mRNA levels is a relatively recent discovery. These findings suggest

An unexpected finding was the significant tendency for
genes within the OXPHOS complexes to co-express
among each other than with genes of other complexes.
This suggests that there is a coordinated control in the levels of mRNAs of genes coding for each complex. It is well
established that there is a tendency for genes participating
in the same metabolic process, or interacting physically,
to co-express [43]. Therefore, these results suggest that,
besides a master regulator of OXPHOS gene expression
driving their co-expression at a tissue level, there is an
underlying fine tuning mechanism regulating the expression of OXPHOS genes within each complex. In our studies, we did not detect a complex-specific pattern of TFBSs.
Future studies will need to be designed to identify the
mechanisms that are responsible for co-expression of
genes within OXPHOS complexes. Although this may be
due to the low power of statistical analyses (few conserved
TFBS per gene promoter), it is possible that this "fine tuning" is orchestrated by cis elements relatively distant from
the promoters or by mRNA degradation.
Previous studies have identified TFBS for NRF1, NRF2,
ERRA, and YY1 in the promoters of some OXPHOS subunits [14,30]. Although only a few of OXPHOS genes have
previously been characterized for the functional role of
these TFBS (Additional file 10), these studies correlate
extremely well with the predicted TFBS identified by our
in silico approach. In this study, human, mouse and rat
promoters of all known OXPHOS and accessory subunits
were analyzed, whilst usually published data concentrates
in the characterization of one promoter in one species.
Therefore, this study constitutes the first comprehensive
analysis of all OXPHOS gene promoters, making a good
case for unbiased computational approach resulting in
biologically relevant data.
Interestingly, statistical analysis of the most abundant
TFBS identified showed that NRF1, EREF, YY1F and CREB
correlate significantly with OXPHOS gene expression pattern. These factors may act independently or synergistically in the transcriptional regulation of OXPHOS genes.
The presence of multiple factors may serve to integrate
diverse signals into mitochondrial biogenesis. In the
mitochondrial field, these TFs were assumed to be master
regulators of mitochondrial gene transcription [30]. The
results obtained in this study extend this concept to a
broader level. Many of these TFs are not specific for
OXPHOS-related genes (e.g. YY1F, CREB) and are also
common in the promoters associated with other metabolic networks, but other are more commonly found in
OXPHOS-related genes (e.g. NRF1, NRF2). Therefore,
although the co-expression of genes coding for mitochon-

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:18

drial proteins can be explained by the presence of TFBS for
TFs such as NRF1, NRF2 and ERRA, both the specific combination of TFs as well as other events controlling mRNA
levels (e.g. coactivators, RNA degradation and long range
cis effects) may ultimately explain the co-regulation.
From analyzing the positional bias around the TSS for the
factors identified, it became apparent that most of the
conserved TFBS identified cluster in specific positions
close to the TSS. This suggests that the TFBS identified by
phylogenetic footprinting are likely to be biologically
functional if present within these clusters.

Conclusion
We showed that the coordinated expression of known
OXPHOS genes goes beyond a mitochondrial or even
OXPHOS pattern, to the level of individual complexes.
This finding implies that either common promoter elements or a feedback mechanism from the assembled complexes influences the levels of mRNAs Although the
identification of the core promoters and their conserved
TFBS of 98 OXPHOS genes provided the initial clues to
understand this process, further work will be required to
fully define the precise mechanisms responsible for this
co-expression.

Methods
Microarray Data Handling
The human and mouse expression atlas was obtained
from GNF [44,28]. This atlas contains custom-designed
whole-genome gene expression arrays from mRNAs
derived from 79 human and 61 mouse tissues and cell
types performed in duplicates and evaluates the expression of 44,775 human and 36,182 mouse transcripts.
Data was analyzed using Genespring microarray analysis
software package (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA).
To control for chip-wide variations in intensity, each array
was normalized to the 50th percentile of genes. In addition, to control for the differences in detection efficiency
between spots, each probeset (the collection of probes
designed to interrogate a given gene sequence) was normalized to its median across all chips or arrays. These normalization steps enabled comparisons of relative change
in gene expression levels between experiments. Duplicate
arrays were then averaged and considered as one.

Data was filtered for mitochondrial genes. A complete list
of human mitochondrial genes was obtained from two
online compilations, which contain data obtained by several proteomic approaches in an effort to obtain the complete list of mitochondrial genes. MitoRES [45] provided
808 genes and MitoProteome [46] which is a mitochondrial protein database generated from experimental evidence such as mass spectrometry and other public
databases provided 869 genes [47]. Data was grouped

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/18

excluding repetitions. For mouse, a complete list of mitochondrial genes was obtained from mitoRES (732 genes).
The mitochondrial genes were compiled with genes
belonging to "mitochondrial related pathways" which
were not present in the lists such as glycolysis, fatty acid
biosynthesis and oxidative stress genes. The resulting
compilation contains 1290 probesets in the human and
1029 probesets in the mouse array datasets. Of these compilations, 147 represent human and 111 represent mouse
OXPHOS genes, which code for both structural as well as
accessory subunits of the respiratoy chain. Both human
and mouse lists of mitochondrial probesets were used in
expression profile analysis and were called "mitochondrial compilation".
Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed on the
"mitochondrial compilation" genelists using Pearson correlation similarity. Genespring software package was used
to create a graphical view of the data.
For the OXPHOS correlation test (explained bellow), two
more datasets were used. The U74A mouse tissue compendium from GNF [48] and the human compilation of
normal tissues available at the Stanford MicroArray Database [49,50].
OXPHOS correlation test
To investigate if OXPHOS subunits co-express preferentially with subunits of the same complex than with subunits of other complexes, a "correlation similarity" test was
designed. For each microarray dataset, a similarity matrix
was made. Pearson's correlation was used to measure the
pair-wise similarity between the expression profiles
among all OXPHOS genes in the matrix (Figure 2). If one
gene was represented by more than one probeset, the
probeset with the highest average correlation values (CV)
was included in the analysis and the rest was discarded.
Next, for each OXPHOS gene (in a column), all other
genes were rank ordered on the basis of their Pearson Correlation Value (CV). A cutoff of 30% of the highest ranking CV was set (Figure 2ii). The percentage of complex X
subunits within the cutoff was calculated for each gene.
Then, the null hypothesis that 'any gene has the same percentage of the different complexes subunits within the
cutoff' was tested using the Student's t-Test. This analysis
was performed for the two mouse and two human tissue
atlases mentioned above.

Because some complexes have very few nuclear coded
genes, the above analysis did not pass our statistical test
for complexes with few subunits (complex II, complex III,
and complex IV). To bypass this restriction, we grouped
the results of the OXPHOS correlation test for all
probesets from the four datasets before applying the statistical test.

Promoter Sequence Extraction and Analysis
Genomatix [51] and the UCSC Genome Browser [52]
human genome May 2004 build were used to extract 1000
bp DNA sequence around the transcriptional start site
(TSS as annotated by RefSeq) for human, mouse and rat
genomes (500 bp upstream and 500 bp downstream from
the TSS). These 1000 bp were considered to contain the
core promoters. In cases where more than one gene promoter was present for a given genome, the promoters conserved across the three species by ElDorado (Genomatix)
were chosen for further analysis. For the sequences of the
promoters analyzed in this study, see supplementary data
(Additional files 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). In genomes where there was
no annotation for a specific gene, BLAT search tool was
used to locate its correspondent EST using an orthologous
mRNA sequence for that gene. In most cases, this
approach could identify the gene in the queried genome
and enabled the promoter extraction. All OXPHOS genes
and other arbitrarily selected mitochondrial genes (n =
235) were analyzed by phylogenetic footprinting.

The presence of CpG islands was assessed by the UCSC
Genome Browser built-in application [53]. The algorithm
considers segments of 200 bp of DNA and evaluates them
for a 50% or greater content of GC. All human promoter
sequences were visually inspected in the browser for the
presence of CpG islands.
Alignment of Orthologous Promoters
Orthologous promoter sequences from human, mouse
and rat were aligned using DiAlignTF (Genomatix, Germany). This application is able to align and identify conserved TFBSs in orthologous promoters. DiAlignTF is a
DNA alignment software that constructs alignments from
gap-free pairs of similar segments of sequences. Therefore,
the program is especially suited to detect short local similarities, characteristic of short TFBS, in otherwise completely unrelated sequences. DialignTF was used with its
default parameters using the Genomatix Matrix Family
Library Version 5.0 (January 2005) and the orthologous
promoters for each gene. This alignment is often called
phylogenetic footprinting. For this analysis, 98 OXPHOS
orthologous promoters (human, mouse and rat) as well
as 134 other gene promoters participating in several mitochondrial pathways were examined.

Because several transcription factors bind similar TFBSs,
Genomatix groups these into TFBS families. For example,
NRF2 binding site is similar to other ETS family members,
and therefore, ETSF (ETS family) contains NRF2 binding
site. Since NRF2 has been implicated in the expression of
some OXPHOS subunits, for this analysis, promoters were
analyzed for the presence of both ETSF (family) and NRF2
(single factor) binding sites. On the other hand, NRF1 has

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/18

its unique TFBS and therefore is not part of any family of
TFBS.
Conserved families of TFBSs in all orthologue promoters
were retrieved. The presence of at least one copy of a conserved TFBS family in the aligned promoter sequences was
examined. The presence of more than one copy of the
same TFBS family was not recorded. Binding sites for the
transcription factor families V$SF1F, V$RORA and
V$ERER (Genomatix nomenclature) are very similar and
therefore often overlap [54]. V$ERER family of transcription factors contains the ERRA binding site, thus only this
family will be considered for this study since ERRA has
previously been associated with OXPHOS gene transcription. All alignment results obtained are available in the
supplementary material (Additional files 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
Human, mouse and rat promoters were used to search all
OXPHOS promoters for the presence of a TATA box. If a
TATA box protein binding site (V$TBPF) was found to be
conserved within 100 bp of the TSS of the aligned promoters, it was considered as a likely functional TATA box. If no
V$TBPF binding site was present the genes were considered as being TATA-less [30].
Statistical Analysis of transcription factor binding sites
(TFBS)
To test if TFBSs identified by phylogenetic footprinting are
enriched in OXPHOS gene promoters over random mitochondrial gene promoters, a statistical test was designed.
This test was performed with all promoters analyzed by
phylogenetic footprinting using DialignTF default parameters (n = 235). An ordered list of all genes was generated
using the Pearson correlation to the expression pattern of
the average expression pattern of OXPHOS genes (the
median of the expression patterns of OXPHOS genes that
clustered in the hierarchical gene tree (Figure 2)). This
resulted in a similarity ordered list of genes where the
most similar values correspond to genes whose expression
pattern was most similar to OXPHOS subunits. Each gene
was then annotated for the presence of each TFBS in its
promoter (Additional file 11). The data was then subjected to a nonparametric Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test for
two independent samples to assess, for each TFBS,
whether genes that contain the TFBS tend to rank high on
the list (i.e. has an expression pattern similar to OXPHOS
genes). A p-value less than 0.05 was considered as a significant association. This analysis was performed for the
human and the mouse GNF tissue atlas [28]

Positional and Binding bias of each TFBS
To examine if conserved TFBSs cluster at a specific position from the TSS, the relative position to the TSS of each
conserved TFBS identified by phylogenetic footprinting
was documented for human, mouse and rat. All OXPHOS

promoters and mitochondrial related promoters analyzed
by phylogenetic footprinting were included in this analysis.

ROS : reactive oxygen species

To study if there was a bias towards the TFBS orientation,
the relative orientation (with respect to the direction of
transcription) of each conserved TFBS analyzed above was
determined. A nonparametric Sign test was used to determine if there was a preference of TF binding orientation.
TFBS orientation depends on the Genomatix library of
position weight matrices (PWM).
