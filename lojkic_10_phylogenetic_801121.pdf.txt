Abstract
Background: The Orf virus (ORFV) is the prototype of the parapoxvirus genus and it primarily causes contagious
ecthyma in goats, sheep, and other ruminants worldwide. In this paper, we described the sequence and
phylogenetic analysis of the B2L gene of ORFV from two natural outbreaks: i) in autochthonous Croatian Cresbreed sheep and ii) on small family goat farm.
Results: Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the ORFV B2L gene showed that the Cro-Cres-12446/09 and
Cro-Goat-11727/10 were not clustered together. Cro-Cres-12446/09 shared the highest similarity with ORFV NZ2
from New Zealand, and Ena from Japan; Cro-Goat-11727/10 was closest to the HuB from China and Taiping and
Hoping from Taiwan.
Conclusion: Distinct ORFV strains are circulating in Croatia. Although ORFV infections are found ubiquitously
wherever sheep and goats are farmed in Croatia, this is the first information on genetic relatedness of any Croatian
ORFV with other isolates around the world.

Background
Genus Parapoxvirus (PPV) has four members, Orf virus
(ORFV), bovine popular stomatitis virus (BPSV), pseudocowpox virus (PCPV), and parapoxvirus of red deer in
New Zealand (PVNZ). The ORFV is the prototype of
the Parapoxvirus Genus and it primarily causes contagious ecthyma in goats, sheep, and other ruminants
worldwide. Spread of infection can be by direct contact
or through exposure to contaminated feeding troughs
and similar fomites, including wheat stubble and thorny
plants. The viruses are sometimes transmissible to
humans due to direct contact [1].
Contagious ecthyma, also known as Orf, contagious
pustular dermatitis, infectious labial dermatitis, scabby
mouth, or sore mouth, is present in any part of the
world where sheep and goats are raised [2].
The ORFV is an epitheliotropic virus that generally
causes proliferative and self-limiting lesions in the skin
of the lips, around the nostrils, oral mucosa and sometimes also affects the gums and tongue, especially in
young lambs. Lesions can also be found occasionally on

the teats of nursing animals and rarely on other organs
[3]. Depending on the location of the lesions, animals
may be unwilling to nurse, eat, or walk. Primary lesions
usually resolve spontaneously within 3-4 weeks [4].
The disease has an economic impact on sheep farmers
due to decreases in production and also has a considerable negative effect on animal welfare. In spite of the
high morbidity mortality rates of up to 10% and 93%
have been reported in lambs and kids, respectively [5,6].
Parapoxviruses are antigenically and genetically related
and have a similar morphology, genomic organization
and virulence mechanism [7]. Parapoxviruses are morphologically distinguished from other poxviruses by their
ovoid shape, the crisscross pattern on the particle surface,
relatively small size and high G+C content of the genome
[8,9]. The ORFV genome consists of linear doublestranded DNA, it is 138 kbp and contains 132 putative
genes [9]. The envelope gene (B2L) of the ORFV encodes
for a highly immunogenic major envelope protein of
about 42 kDa, which is a homologue of vaccinia virus
major envelope antigen p37K [10]. The B2L gene has
been used for the detection, molecular characterization
and phylogenetic analysis of ORFV [11-13].
ORFV infections are found ubiquitously wherever
sheep and goats are farmed in Croatia, since 1949, when

it was recorded first time [14]. Although outbreaks of
Orf have occurred, there were no reports available of
the molecular diagnosis, characterization and phylogenetic analysis of the viruses involved.
In this paper, we described the sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the B2L gene of ORFVs from two natural outbreaks of infection: i) in autochthonous Croatian
Cres-breed sheep and ii) on small family goat farm. This
is the first information on genetic relatedness of any
Croatian ORFV with other isolates around the world.

Results
Affected animals from a Cres-breed free-range sheep
flock presented typical ORFV mucosal and skin lesions.
Ulcerations were presented at the nasal and oral mucosa
accompanied with pustular dermatitis and severe yellowish to brownish crust formations on the lip commissures
with spread to the muzzle and nostrils, ear tip skin and
occasionally trunk skin. Morbidity among the lambs
(3 weeks up to 2 months old) and ewes was 100% and
40%, respectively. Mortality due to starvation was
recorded in 80% of affected lambs owing to suckling difficulty. Affected animals from a small family goat farm
were suffering from typical ORFV ulcerations at the oral
and nasal mucosa, and crust formations on doe teats.
Morbidity in does and kids were 50% and 100%, respectively; recovery from disease took 3-4 weeks. No human
infections were reported during both outbreaks.
A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method using primers to amplify part of the ORFV B2L gene was used to
amplify a specific fragment (594 bp) from field specimens of affected animals. Sequence analyses of the
nucleotide and deduced amino acid of the ORFV B2L
gene showed that the Cro-Cres-12446/09 (HQ215589)
shared close relationship with other ORFV isolates from
different regions (96,5-99.5% and 96,9-100%) and shared
the highest homology with NZ2 from New Zealand, and
Ena from Japan (99.5% and 100% at the nucleotide and
aminoacid level, respectively). Cro-Goat-11727/10
(HQ215588) shared the highest similarity with NE1 isolate from Brazil, HuB from China and Taiping and Hoping goat isolates from Taiwan. The percent identities
and diversities of the nucleotide sequence of the B2L
gene among the different strains of ORFV were shown
in Table 1. Our viruses differ from each other in 8
nucleotides and only two amino acids, on analysed fragment. The deduced amino acid sequences did not
revealed any unique substitution.
Phylogenetic analysis of parapox virus nucleotide
sequences produced the similar branching patterns by
both different methods: the Neighbor-joining (NJ) and
the Bayesian inference (Figure 1). Posterior probabilities
of MrBayes tree (Figure 1) showed good support for the
three main parapox lineages: ORFV, PCPV and BPSV.

Croatian viruses clustered only with ORFV. The strains
of Orf lineage formed two sub-clusters; Croatian isolate
Cro-Cres-12446/09 were clustered together with viruses
from New Zealand, Japan and Brazil (AY453667,
AB189670, AB521175, FJ665818) and Cro-Goat-11727/
10 with HuB isolate from China (GU320351), another
Brazilian isolate NE1 (FJ665819) and Taiwanese isolate
Taiping (EU327506) (Figure 1).

Discussion
The ORFV is common in Croatia, but is not reported in
the literature because of its low morbidity and minimal
economic consequences. Accordingly, immunisation of
sheep and goat is not practised. It is usually diagnosed
based on pathologic examinations and clinical signs.
Although Croatia has a number of sheep and goat farms,
Croatian islands and coast are the most representative
breeding regions, with 56% from the total number of registered ewes and rams [15]. Cres-breed sheep with multiple
production traits (meat-milk) is characteristic for Croatian
islands Cres and Lošinj where almost 60% of territory is
covered with rocky pastures, karst and poor vegetation.
In our studies we analyzed the nucleotide sequences of a
fragment within the B2L gene of ORFV from two natural
outbreaks of the Orf, one among sheep in the island of
Cres, and other one in goats from continental part of
country. The studies on genetic diversity of ORFV existing
in the sheep and/or goat population in Croatia were not
carried out before. Recent studies on genetic diversity of
ORFV strains and isolates from small ruminants were carried out in China [16,17], India [11,18], Brazil [19] and
Egypt [20].
Phylogenetic analysis of parapox virus nucleotide
sequences produced the similar branching patterns by
both different methods: the Neighbor-joining and the
Bayesian inference. However MrBayes tree was the most
accurate tree out of two calculated trees, so we chose it
as a reference tree in study (Figure 1). The grouping
pattern in which all the parapoxviruses - ORFV, PCPV
and BPSV - formed separate clusters was consistent
with report of Tikkanen et al. [13]. In the phylogenetic
tree, the viruses under study grouped only with ORFV.
Our study demonstrated that Cro-Cres-12446/09 and
Cro-Goat-11727/10 are not in same cluster. Cro-Cres12446/09 is grouped with isolates from New Zealand,
Brazil and Japan. Vaccinal and OV IA82 forms a subgroup within this sub-cluster, which is well supported in
Bayesian tree (95%), and by the divergence factor (average 1,4) from other viruses in this cluster. Cro-Goat11727/10 is grouped with isolates from China, Taiwan
and Brazil. The first group is sharing two aminoacid sites
differ from the second group. Protein sequences variations between ORFV isolates are already detected [9].
These amino acid substitutions among two groups could

Figure 1 Phylogenetic analysis of different parapoxviruses based on the partial nucleotide sequence of ORFV B2L gene. The
phylogenetic relationship was calculated using Bayesian Inference analysis. The Cro-Cres-12446/09 and Cro-Goat-11727/10 has accession
numbers HQ215589, and HQ215588, respectively. Posterior probability values are shown for all nodes.

also be attributed to their separate geographical or evolutionary origin. Since Cres and continental viruses are not
in same sub-cluster, the bigger number of available
sequences in the GenBank from the neighbouring countries would be of help in explanation of the genetic relatedness of Orf viruses. For that reason it is hard to explain
the origin of ORFV on a goat farm. That farm is the only

one in that area, and farmers are regularly buying hay
from the neighbouring regions. According to the veterinarian in charge, no contagious echtyma was recorded in
that region in last 10 years. Concerning to the origin of
ORFV in Cres-breed sheep, it is interesting that in 1995,
due to devastation of sheep husbandry during the war,
Australia and New Zealand contributed sheep to Croatia.

Lojkic et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:314
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/314

Sheep were transported in Croatian region Lika. Unfortunately, we didn’t find the valuable data if some of the
sheep were actually brought to this island, which is likely
because Lika is only 100 kilometres away and sheep
farmers from Cres are regularly buying hay in Lika. It is
possible that some of the imported sheep were persistently infected when introduced into new herd. Also, the
long-lasting and stressed transportation of sheep from
Australia could cause disease afterwards, and release of
the virus to environment. It is well documented that
viruses from Poxviridae family show a high environmental stability and stay contagious over a period of several
months in an ambient environment. Their high resistance to drying is even enhanced by materials in which
they are released into the environment (e.g., dermal
crusts, serum, blood residues and other excretions
[21,22].
We must emphasize that the Cres-breed sheep flock
(which is normally held free-ranged) were held in small
enclosure before the lambing onset, due to protection
from wild boars attacks on lambs. Agglomeration of the
entire flock in restricted area leaded to poor husbandry
and close contact between persistently infected ewes
and lambs which provided pronounced spread of virus.
Persistently infected animals showing no clinical disease
have been described [23] and it is possible that such animals contribute to the inter-epidemic survival of the
virus. Regarding to the sequence similarity with viruses
from New Zealand, Brazil and Japan, we could presume
the origin of our virus from that part of the world, but
not the exact way of its transmission. For the origin of
Cro-Goat-11727/10 we can also suggest one of two
described scenarios: contamination of hay or persistent
infection. As we mentioned before, the bigger number
of available sequences in the GenBank from the Croatia’s neighbouring countries would be of help in explanation of the evolutionary or geographical origin and
genetic relatedness of our ORFVs.

Conclusion
In the present report, we described a severe outbreaks of
contagious ecthyma in Cres-breed sheep flock and on
small family goat farm and identify the causative agent
as an ORFV that is genetically closely related with other
ORFV isolates from distant geographical regions.
Although Orf is endemic in Croatia, before this report
there was no information on genetic relatedness of any
Croatian ORFV with other isolates around the world.
Methods
Tissue samples were taken from four lambs found dead
originated from a farm of Cres-breed free-range sheep
from Island of Cres (coordinates: 44°51’ 52” North, 14°
23’ 67” East). The flock sized 400 ewes and 300 lambs

suffering from contagious ecthyma in lambing season
from January to March 2009.
Another material was taken in March 2010 from a doe
originated from a small family goat farm in continental
part of Croatia (Turopolje region) (coordinates: 45°39’
32” North, 15°57’ 48” East). The herd sized 16 does and
4 kids suffering from typical ORFV ulcerations at the
oral and nasal mucosa, and crust formations on doe
teats.
Scabs, formed over the lesions (approximately 3-5
scabs per animal) were collected and 10% suspension in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, was prepared.
DNA was extracted from suspension using the NucleoSpin Tissue Kit (Machery-nagel, Duren, Germany)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A set of
primers: PPP-1 (5’-gtc gtc cac gat gag gag ct-3) and
PPP-4 (5’-tac gtg gga agc gcc tcg ct-3), which amplify
the 594 bp fragment was used in this study. These primers were designed by Inoshima et al. [12] based on the
previously published sequence of the B2L gene of ORFV
isolate NZ2.
The PCR reaction (total volume of 50 μl) contained 100
ng of extracted DNA, 25 μl JumpStartTM REDTaq®ReadyMix TM (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) and
0.20 μM of each primer. Thermal cycling parameters
were: initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min, then 35
cycles of: denaturation at 94°C for 35 sec, annealing at
60°C for 35 sec, and extension at 72 °C for 45 sec, followed by the final extension at 72°C for 5 min. The reaction products were analyzed by 1,5% agarose gel
electrophoresis and stained with ethidium-bromide. The
PCR products that showed expected amplicon length
were considered positive and purified by Exosap (USB,
Staufen, Germany). Sequencing was performed in both
directions by Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, Korea). The partial
sequence of the major envelope gene of our viruses CroCres-12446/09 and Cro-Goat-11727/10 were submitted
to GenBank with accession numbers HQ215589, and
HQ215588, respectively and compared with 18 different
parapoxvirus strains including Bovine papular stomatitis
virus (BPSV) and Pseudocowpox virus (PCPV). Detailed
information of analysed sequences was shown in Table 2.
Comparisons of the obtained nucleotide sequences
with those of parapoxviruses available in the Genbank
database were performed using the online BLAST program. Sequence identities of nucleotides, as well as
those of amino acids, were analyzed using the ClustalX
implemented in Mega4 software [24]. The same tool
was used to perform Neighbor-Joining (NJ) analysis,
based on p-distance. Reliabilities of phylogenetic relationships were evaluated using nonparametric bootstrap
analysis [25] with 1000 replicates for NJ analysis. Estimation of the Mean Evolutionary Diversity among our
and vaccinal viruses were calculated as percentage of

confirm the obtained data from NJ analysis, another
phylogenetic tree was calculated using MrBayes v3.0b3
[27]. In Bayesian Inference (BI) analysis [28] four incrementally heated Markov Chains were run for 1,000,000
generations (ngen = 1,000,000), sampling every 100 generations (samplefreq = 100), where 2500 samples were
discarded (burnin = 2500). A consensus tree was constructed from the tree output files produced in the BI
analysis using TreeView http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.
