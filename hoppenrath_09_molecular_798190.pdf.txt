Abstract
Background: Dinoflagellates represent a major lineage of unicellular eukaryotes with unparalleled diversity and
complexity in morphological features. The monophyly of dinoflagellates has been convincingly demonstrated, but
the interrelationships among dinoflagellate lineages still remain largely unresolved. Warnowiid dinoflagellates are
among the most remarkable eukaryotes known because of their possession of highly elaborate ultrastructural
systems: pistons, nematocysts, and ocelloids. Complex organelles like these are evolutionary innovations found
only in a few athecate dinoflagellates. Moreover, the taxonomy of warnowiids is extremely confusing and
inferences about the evolutionary history of this lineage are mired by the absence of molecular phylogenetic data
from any member of the group. In this study, we provide the first molecular phylogenetic data for warnowiids and
couple them with a review of warnowiid morphological features in order to formulate a hypothetical framework
for understanding character evolution within the group. These data also enabled us to evaluate the evolutionary
relationship(s) between warnowiids and the other group of dinoflagellates with complex organelles: polykrikoids.
Results: Molecular phylogenetic analyses of SSU and LSU rDNA sequences demonstrated that warnowiids form
a well-supported clade that falls within the more inclusive Gymnodinium sensu stricto clade. These data also
confirmed that polykrikoids are members of the Gymnodinium sensu stricto clade as well; however, a specific sister
relationship between the warnowiid clade and the polykrikoid clade was unresolved in all of our analyses.
Nonetheless, the new DNA sequences from different isolates of warnowiids provided organismal anchors for
several previously unidentified sequences derived from environmental DNA surveys of marine biodiversity.
Conclusion: Comparative morphological data and molecular phylogenetic data demonstrate that the polykrikoid
and the warnowiid clade are closely related to each other, but the precise branching order within the
Gymnodinium sensu stricto clade remains unresolved. We regard the ocelloid as the best synapomorphy for
warnowiids and infer that the most recent common ancestor of polykrikoids and warnowiids possessed both
nematocysts and photosynthetic plastids that were subsequently lost during the early evolution of warnowiids.
Our summary of species and genus concepts in warnowiids demonstrate that the systematics of this poorly
understood group is highly problematic and a comprehensive revision is needed.

Background
Dinoflagellates represent a major lineage of unicellular
eukaryotes with unparalleled diversity and complexity in
morphological features, molecular processes, nutritional
modes and symbioses with distantly related organisms [13]. The ecological importance of dinoflagellates is also
extraordinary; members of the group play key roles as
marine primary producers, coral reef zooxanthellae, and
(micro)consumers in aquatic communities around the
globe. The monophyly of dinoflagellates and their relationship to other alveolate taxa – particularly apicomplexans and ciliates – have been convincingly demonstrated
with congruent molecular phylogenetic data [e.g., [1,49]]. However, the interrelationships among dinoflagellate
lineages still remain largely unresolved, especially near
the phylogenetic backbone of the group [e.g., [10-12]].
Although significant events in the evolutionary radiation
of dinoflagellate diversity have been inferred from comparative analyses of morphological characters alone [e.g.,
[13]], the coupling of these data with molecular phylogenetic data, including environmental DNA surveys of biodiversity, has more robustly demonstrated delimitations
between 'species' and the monophyly of several dinoflagellate subgroups [e.g., [10,11,14]].
Brief history of athecate dinoflagellate systematics
Understanding the phylogenetic relationships of athecate
(syn. unarmored or naked) dinoflagellates has been problematic for more than a century, because of difficulties in
identifying reliable morphological characters with light
microscopy. For instance, overlapping and ambiguous criteria, such as episome dimensions and the displacement
of the cingulum, have been used in the past to distinguish
genera from one another. Improved methods incorporating both molecular and morphological data have been
used to re-investigate the type species of different athecate
genera that have long been recognized to be polyphyletic,
such as Gymnodinium Stein, Gyrodinium Kofoid et Swezy,
and Amphidinium Claparède et Lachmann [10,15-18].
More precise re-definitions of these genera have caused
many of the species that were formerly assigned to them
to be considered "sensu lato taxa". Accordingly, several
new genera have been established over the past decade to
accommodate these newly recognized lineages, such as
Akashiwo Hansen and Moestrup,Karenia Hansen and Moestrup, Karlodinium Larsen, Takayama de Salas, Bolch, Botes
et Hallegraeff, Togula Flø Jørgensen, Murray et Daugbjerg,
Prosoaulax Calado et Moestrup, and Apicoporus Sparmann,
Leander et Hoppenrath [10,19-22].

Apical surface structures found in athecate dinoflagellates
using electron microscopy, such as 'acrobases' (apical
grooves) and apical pores with hook-like protrusions,
have turned out to be phylogenetically meaningful features that are consistent with more natural classification

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/116

systems [10,19,22-24]. Moreover, variable features of
chloroplasts (or more generally 'plastids') can be diagnostic at both the generic level, such as Karenia and Lepidodinium, and the species level, such as within Gymnodinium
and Polykrikos Bütschli [e.g., [25-27]]. Characters like the
formation of pseudocolonies and the possession of complex organelles are evolutionary innovations found only
in a few athecate dinoflagellates, namely polykrikoids and
warnowiids [27-29]. Although the value of these characteristics for establishing robust phylogenetic hypotheses is
expected to be high, molecular phylogenetic data are still
unavailable for most of these lineages. This is mainly due
to the fact that polykrikoids and warnowiids are uncultivated and difficult to both find and isolate from natural
marine samples [27,28,30].
Complex organelles in athecate dinoflagellates
Polykrikoids and warnowiids are among the most remarkable eukaryotes on the planet because of their possession
of highly elaborate ultrastructural systems: pistons, nematocysts, nematocyst-taeniocyst complexes and ocelloids
[29] (Figure 1). A piston is a relatively long posterior 'tentacle' with an exaggerated capacity for rapid and repeated
contraction and is, so far, known only in two genera
(Erythropsidinium and Greuetodinum) [29]. The function of
the piston remains unknown. Dinoflagellate nematocysts
are found only in some polykrikoids and warnowiids, and
are composed of one or several extrusive filaments. The
detailed morphology of the nematocysts differs in the two
groups [29] (see also Figures 1f and 1l), and in Polykrikos,
the nematocysts are linked to additional extrusive
organelles called 'taeniocysts' [29,31]. The nematocysttaeniocyst complex of Polykrikos species is a synapomorphy for the genus, but the presence of nematocysts in warnowiids suggests that these two lineages are closely related
(i.e., dinoflagellate nematocysts are homologous)
[27,28]. Another formal possibility is that nematocysts
evolved twice independently within athecate dinoflagellates: once in polykrikoids and once in warnowiids. This
scenario is not unprecedented, because cnidarians, which
are very distantly related to dinoflagellates, also possess
different kinds of cnidae (e.g., nematocysts and spirocysts) within cells called 'cnidocytes' that presumably
evolved independently from those found in athecate
dinoflagellates. However, a scenario involving kleptocnidae is also possible, whereby nematocysts were horizontally transferred between cnidarians and dinoflagellates
during evolutionary history [32]. Regardless, molecular
phylogenetic data from warnowiid species are required to
shed additional light onto these hypotheses, which was
one of the main aims of this study.

Perhaps the most complex organelle found in any dinoflagellate so far happens to be synapomorphic for warnowiids, namely a distinctive multilayered photoreceptor

called an 'ocelloid' [29] (see also Figure 1e). Ocelloids are
composed entirely of subcellular components and are
highly reminiscent in general organization to the multicellular camera eyes that evolved independently in several
different lineages of metazoans (e.g. cubozoans, scallops,
cephalopods and vertebrates) [33]. The complexity of
these subcellular systems is so distinctive that ocelloids
have been described as "the most extraordinarily sophisticated differentiations of grouped structures for a single
function in protists" [13]. Ocelloids are comprised of two
main components: a hyalosome and a melanosome [29].
The translucent haylosome consists of a layered cornealike structure and a lens-like inclusion that are bounded at
the base by iris-like constriction rings; the melanosome is
a highly ordered and pigmented retina-like body that is
separated from the hyalosome by a seawater chamber. In
fact, the melanosome (syn. pigment cup or retinal body)
appears to be a highly derived plastid with thylacoids that
can be recognized when the melanosome becomes relatively unordered during cell division and daughter cell
formation; by contrast, the hyalosome appears to be synthesized by the cell and is disassembled during cell division before being reassembled in each daughter cell [[29];
this study]. The structural details of ocelloids are specific
to different warnowiid lineages (e.g. the number of constriction rings and the position of the ocelloid in the dinoflagellate cell) [29], and this variation provides important
insights into the evolutionary history of the clade.
Other general features of warnowiids
Although most are heterotrophic, three of the about 40
described species of polykrikoids and warnowiids are
photosynthetic, namely Pheopolykrikos hartmannii (Zimmermann) Matsuoka et Fukuyo, Polykrikos lebourae Herdman, and Nematodinium armatum (Dogiel) Kofoid et
Swezy [e.g., [27,28,34,35]]. The cingulum in warnowiids
is always displaced and encircles the cells at least once and
sometimes more than twice. Some warnowiids produce
mucoid hyalin cysts (Figures 1h, n), probably vegetative
division cysts, as shown in our Figures 1i, o and 1p. The
taxonomy of warnowiids is poorly understood and confusing, and many of the species described by Kofoid and
Swezy [36] are probably conspecific. Some reports indicate that the structure, color and position of the ocelloid
can change during the course of cell division and development [37], and that these ocelloid features are unreliable
taxonomic criteria for delimiting species and genera
[37,38]. Accordingly, different authors have adopted different classification systems when discussing the group
(Table 1) [6,39-41].

In order to more clearly outline the taxonomic challenges
associated with understanding warnowiid diversity, we
have summarized the morphological features described
for each warnowiid genus in Table 2[24,29,30,34-38,42-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/116

53]. Currently, Erythropsidinium and Greuetodinium are
characterized by having a piston, and Greuetodinium is
separated from Erythropsidinium by possessing the only
ocelloid of the composite type (multiplication of 'lenses')
at the anterior end of the cell; Proterythropsis also has a projection off of the posterior end of the cell, but it is immobile and called a 'posterior extension'. Nematocysts have
only been found in Nematodinium and Proterythropsis.
Although Warnowia Lindemann lacks plastids, nematocysts, a piston and a posterior extension, a relatively broad
spectrum of cell morphologies associated with the acrobase, cingulum, sulcus, and position of the ocelloid has
been described within this genus; thus, Warnowia probably represents an artificial assemblage of species. Nonetheless, inferences about the evolutionary history of
warnowiids, in general, are mired by the absence of
molecular phylogenetic data from any member of the
group.
In this study, we provide the first molecular phylogenetic
data for warnowiids: small subunit (SSU) rDNA
sequences were obtained from two species of 'Warnowia'
(one from British Columbia and one from Florida), two
isolates of 'Nematodinium sp.' (both from British Columbia), and two isolates of 'Proterythropsis sp.' (both from
British Columbia); partial large subunit (LSU) rDNA
sequences were obtained from one species of 'Nematodinium' (from British Columbia) and one species of Warnowia (from British Columbia). Moreover, we obtained
partial LSU rDNA sequences from three polykrikoid species: Polykrikos kofoidii (from British Columbia), Polykrikos
lebourae (from British Columbia), and 'Pheopolykrikos'
hartmannii (from Maryland). These molecular phylogenetic data were coupled with a review of warnowiid morphological data (Table 2) in order to formulate a
hypothetical framework for understanding character evolution within the group.

Methods
Collection of organisms and light microscopy
Near surface plankton samples were collected in the
morning hours with a small net (mesh-size 20 μm) at the
docks of the Bamfield Marine Sciences Center, Vancouver
Island, BC (48°50.0' N, 125°8.0' W) in June 2005, April
2006, April 2007 and May 2007. Immediately after sampling, single cells of the species were identified at 40× to
250× magnifications and isolated from the mixed plankton sample by micropipetting for the preparations
described below. Cells were observed directly and micromanipulated with a Leica DMIL inverted microscope connected to a PixeLink Megapixel color digital camera. For
DIC light microscopy, micropipetted cells were placed on
a glass specimen slide and covered with a cover slip.
Images were produced directly with either the PixeLink
Megapixel color digital camera or a Zeiss Axioplan 2 imag-

ing microscope connected to a Leica DC500 color digital
camera. Sand samples containing Polykrikos lebourae were
collected with a spoon during low tide at Centennial
Beach, Boundary Bay, BC (49°0.0' N, 123°8.0' W) in May
2007. The sand samples were transported directly to the
laboratory, and the flagellates were separated from the
sand by extraction through a fine filter (mesh size 45 μm)
using melting seawater-ice [54]. The flagellates accumulated in a Petri dish beneath the filter and were then identified at 40× to 250× magnifications. Cells were isolated
by micropipetting for the preparations described below.
Samples containing Erythropsidinium and an unidentified
"Warnowia sp." (Florida) were collected from the Gulf
Stream off of Ft. Pierce, Florida (N27° 28.25' and W79°
53.62') on August 28, 2007. Pheopolykrikos hartmannii was
collected from the Rhode River, MD at the Smithsonian
Environmental Research Center (SERC) dock (N38° 53.1'
W 76° 32.5') on July 31, 2007. A horizontal plankton tow
was taken from the surface layer using a net with a meshsize of 35 μm. Samples were held at ambient temperature
and transported to the lab. The sample was screened using
a 250 μm-mesh Nitex sieve to remove large zooplankton,
and diluted with seawater to enhance viability during
transport. Cells were visualized through a dissecting
microscope and individually picked using drawn glass
tubing and mouth aspiration. Each cell was washed six
times with 0.2 μm filtered station water, photographed,
placed into a sterile 1.5-mL microfuge tube containing 40
μL of lysis buffer, amended with Igepal instead of nonidet
P40, and frozen at -80°C [55].
Scanning electron microscopy
A mixed-extraction sample containing 'Proterythropsis' sp.
was fixed with OsO4 for 30 min at room temperature.

Cells were transferred onto a 5-μm polycarbonate membrane filter (Corning Separations Div., Acton, MA),
washed with distilled water, dehydrated with a graded
series of ethanol and critical point dried with CO2. The filter was mounted on a stub, sputter-coated with gold and
viewed under a Hitachi S4700 Scanning Electron Microscope.
DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing
Cells collected in British Columbia were manually isolated and washed three times in f/2-medium. Three different methods for DNA extraction were used over the years.
(1) Collected cells were placed directly into 400 μL CTAB
extraction buffer (1.12 g Tris, 8.18 g NaCl, 0.74 g EDTA, 2
g CTAB, 2 g Polyvinylpyrolidone, 0.2 mL 2-mercaptoethanol in 100 ml water) in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. The tube
was placed in a heat-block and incubated at 63°C for 20
min with several vigorous shakes in between. After separation with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1), the aqueous
phase was precipitated in 70% ethanol. The dry DNA pellets were stored in the freezer and transported to the University of British Columbia on ice. Distilled water was
added to each sample prior to PCR. (2) Genomic DNA
was extracted by making a final washing step in distilled
water, and the osmotically disrupted cells were used
directly for PCR. (3) Genomic DNA was extracted using
the MasterPure Complete DNA and RNA Purification Kit
(EPICENTRE, Madison, WI, USA). The small subunit
rDNA sequence was PCR amplified using puReTaq Readyto-go PCR beads (GE Healthcare, Quebec, Canada), with
an error rate of 1 per 20,000–40,000 bases, and universal
eukaryotic primers reported previously [[56]; Table 3].
The large subunit rDNA sequence was also PCR amplified
using puReTaq Ready-to-go PCR beads and D1R-R2 primers published by Scholin et al. [57] and Yamaguchi et al.

[58] (Table 3). Information about the date of collection,
number of isolated cells, method of DNA extraction and
primer combination for each DNA sequence is shown in
Table 4 [GenBank accession codes FJ947036–FJ947046].
PCR products of the expected size were gel isolated and
cloned into pCR2.1 vector using a TOPO TA cloning kit
(Invitrogen Corporation, CA, USA). One clone for each
species was completely sequenced with ABI big-dye reaction mix using both vector primers and two internal primers oriented in both directions.
Warnowiid cells collected from the east coast of North
America were frozen in microfuge tubes before being
thawed and sonicated using a probe tipped sonicator
(Heat Systems Ultrasonic, Inc. Model W-225R, Plain
View, NY) set to a power level of 3 and a 30% duty cycle.
The sonicator probe was immersed in the sample, and
three to five pulses of sonication were used over ~5 seconds. The probe was washed between each sample with
10% bleach solution, rinsed with distilled water, and
wiped dry with a kimwipe. Dummy samples without cells

were sonicated and used as negative controls. Ribosomal
DNA regions were amplified with the following primer
combinations EukA-EukB (SSU), Dino1662F-25R1 (ITS
and part of LSU) and 25F1-LSUR2 (last part of LSU) for
'Pheopolykrikos' hartmannii (Table 3) [58-62]. The resulting
products were sequenced with the same primers they were
amplified with and the primers D3A and DLSUR2 (Table
3) [63] and assembled into a contig of 3,637 bases covering the SSU-ITS-LSU region. For the "Warnowia sp." (Florida), the EukA-EukB PCR product was used as a template
for the following nested PCR amplifications: EukADinoR, SR4–SR9 and SR8–SR12 (Table 3) [58,59,61,63];
single PCR bands derived from each primer pair were
sequenced with internal primers shown in Table 3. PCR
experiments were run in 20-μL volumes with the following final concentrations: 500 mg/mL BSA (Sigma A2053),
50 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.3), 3 mM Mg, 10 μM dNTPs, 0.12
units of Promega Go-Taq, and 4 μL of sample (1 μL in the
case of nested PCR). Cycling conditions were 95°C for 2
min, followed by 40 cycles of the following: 95°C for 30
s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1.5 min. This was followed with

a 72°C step for 5 min after which the reactions were held
at 4°C. The products from these reactions were visualized
on ethidium bromide stained 1.5% agarose gels, precipitated using PEG (20% w/v polyethylene glycol, mw 8000,
2.5 M NaCl solution), washed with 70% ethanol, briefly
air dried, resuspended in 10 μL of distilled water, and
sequenced using Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, California) and an ABI 3730 sequencer. Sequence identity was
evaluated initially by BLAST using the NCBI nonredundant database [64] and then by phylogenetic analyses.
Alignments and molecular phylogenetic analyses
The new SSU and LSU rDNA sequences were aligned with
other alveolate sequences using MacClade 4 [65], forming

a 45-taxon and 36-taxon alignment respectively. However, we also analyzed our new LSU sequences within the
context of several shorter-length sequences retrieved from
GenBank, forming a 47-taxon alignment, and concatenated our SSU-LSU rDNA sequences where possible,
forming a 17-taxon alignment. These four alignments are
available on request. Maximum likelihood (ML) and
Bayesian methods using the General Time Reversible
(GTR) model of nucleotide substitutions were performed
on all four alignments, this model was selected with
MODELTEST version 3.06 [66]. All gaps were excluded
from the alignments prior to phylogenetic analysis. The
alpha shape parameters were estimated from the data
using GTR, a gamma distribution with invariable sites and
four rate categories (45-taxon SSU alignment with 1693

analyzed using the parameters listed above were constructed with PhyML [67,68]. ML bootstrap analyses were
also performed with PhyML (GTR+I+G model) on five
hundred re-sampled datasets (one heuristic search per
dataset) from each of the four alignments.
The four alignments were analyzed with Bayesian methods using the MrBayes program 3.1.2 [69,70]. The program was set to operate with a gamma distribution and
four Monte-Carlo-Markov chains (MCMC) starting from a
random tree. A total of 2,000,000 generations were calculated with trees sampled every 50 generations and with a
prior burn-in of 100,000 generations (2000 sampled trees
were discarded; burn-in was checked manually). A majority rule consensus tree was constructed from 38,001 postburn-in trees. Posterior probabilities correspond to the
frequency at which a given node was found in the postburn-in trees. Independent Bayesian runs on each alignment yielded similar results.

Results & Discussion
Warnowiids evolved from within the Gymnodinium sensu
stricto clade
The SSU- and LSU-rDNA sequences reported here were
derived from cells like those shown in Figure 1. The general surface morphology of warnowiids, as represented by
'Proterythropsis' sp. (British Columbia), consisted of many
small alveoli, a loop-shaped acrobase, an obliquely oriented cingulum and an ocelloid (Figure 2). These morphological data are consistent with the only other known
SEMs of warnowiids, namely Erythropsidinium, Warnowia
and Nematodinium [24]. The phylogenetic position of the
warnowiid sequences within the dinoflagellates is shown
in the following figures: Figure 3 – the SSU rDNA alignment of 45 taxa and 1693 sites containing many athecate
dinoflagellates and environmental sequences; Figure 4 –
the LSU rDNA alignment of 36 taxa and 855 sites; Additional file 1 – the shorter-length LSU rDNA alignment of
47 taxa including only 358 sites; and Additional file 2 –
the combined SSU- and LSU-rDNA alignment of 17 taxa
and 2549 sites. These molecular phylogenetic data demonstrated that warnowiids form a moderately supported
clade that falls within the Gymnodinium sensu stricto (s.s.)
clade with very strong statistical support (Figures 3 and 4,
Additional files 1 and 2). Although the nearest sister lineage to the warnowiid clade was unresolved in all of our
analyses, the following taxa also clustered strongly within
the Gymnodinium s.s.: Pheopolykrikos beauchampii, the
Polykrikos clade and several species of Gymnodinium and
Lepidodinium (e.g. G. impudicum, G. fuscum, G. dorsalisulcum, G. catenatum, L. chlorophorum and L. viride) (Figures
3 and 4, Additional files 1 and 2). Therefore, the Gymnod-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/116

inium s.s. clade contains several well delimited genera in
addition to Gymnodinium [26-28].
The phylogenetic relationships within the warnowiid
clade were poorly resolved near the backbone (Figure 3).
However, the molecular phylogenetic analyses did demonstrate that the two isolates of 'Nematodinium' grouped
strongly together, and this clade formed the nearest sister
group to the Warnowia sp. collected from British Columbia (Figures 3 and 4, Additional files 1 and 2). The two
isolates of 'Proterythropsis' also grouped strongly together
with an environmental sequence, namely EF527120, collected from Framvaren Fjord, Norway, (Figure 3) [A.
Behnke, pers. comm.]. The "Warnowia sp." collected from
Florida was much more divergent and clustered strongly
with several environmental sequences collected from Sargasso Sea (Figure 3) [Armbrust et al., unpublished]; two of
the environmental sequences, namely AY664983 and
AY665026, formed the nearest sister lineages to this "Warnowia sp." (Florida) (Figure 3). The molecular phylogenetic analyses of SSU rDNA also indicated that the
following environmental sequences probably represent a
single, potentially undescribed, warnowiid species:
AY664914, AY664912, AY664911 and AY664896 (Figure
3). The generated SSU rDNA sequence for Erythropsidinium was too divergent to be included into the analysis.
Daugbjerg et al. [10] hypothesized that the warnowiid
Nematodinium armatum is related to the Gymnodinium s.s.,
because of the presence of a nuclear fibrous connector and
the loop-shaped acrobase. This is the only published
hypothesis about the possible relationship of a warnowiid
taxon to other dinoflagellate taxa, and our molecular phylogenetic analyses reinforced this hypothesis. The characteristic feature for the Gymnodinium s.s. clade is the loopshaped acrobase which has been demonstrated in the
Gymnodinium species within this clade, Lepidodinium, 'Pheopolykrikos' hartmannii, Polykrikos spp., and Nematodinium
armatum [e.g., [24,26-28]]. We have shown for the first
time that a loop-shaped acrobase is also present in 'Proterythropsis' sp. (Figure 2) and hypothesize, based on our
molecular phylogenetic data, that a similar acrobase morphology is present in the 'Nematodinium' and Warnowia
species isolated from British Columbia (Figure 3).
We present the first LSU rDNA sequence for P. lebourae.
Although a strongly supported Polykrikos clade, within the
Gymnodinium s.s. clade, was shown previously in SSU phylogenies [27,28] (Figure 3), this clade did not receive
strong statistical support in our phylogenetic analyses of
LSU rDNA sequences (Figure 4 and Additional file 1) [71].
Character evolution in warnowiids
The presence of nematocysts in both warnowiids and
polykrikoids suggests that the most recent common
ancestor of both lineages already possessed these complex

sized that during the evolution of warnowiids, the ocelloid increased in complexity:

organelles [28]. This hypothesis would be significantly
bolstered if it were demonstrated in molecular phylogenetic analyses that the two clades are indeed closely
related to one another. Our results strongly demonstrated
that warnowiids and polykrikoids are both members of
the Gymnodinium s.s. clade; however, a specific sister relationship between the two subgroups, to the exclusion of
Gymnodinium and Lepidodinium sequences, remained
unresolved in all four datasets (Figures 3 and 4, Additional files 1 and 2). Regardless, when considering the
overall phylogenetic distribution of nematocysts within
the Gymnodinium s.s. clade, the most parsimonious explanation requires that nematocysts originated once in the
most recent ancestor of polykrikoids and warnowiids and
were subsequently lost, at least once, within the warnowiid clade (Figure 5). Although less parsimonious scenarios
can also explain the distribution of nematocysts in
polykrikoids and warnowiids (e.g., several independent
gains or kleptocnidae), there is currently no evidence to
support these alternatives.
The ocelloid is perhaps the most striking feature of all
dinoflagellates and is the best synapomorphy for the warnowiid clade as inferred from SSU- and LSU-rDNA
sequences (Figures 3, 4 and 5). Greuet [42] performed the
pioneering ultrastructural research on warnowiids, and
the structural diversity found in different ocelloids led
him to formulate a hypothesis about character evolution
within the group; variations of ocelloids have been
described in Nematodinium, 'Warnowia morphotype II',
and Erythropsidinium [35,42-48]. Greuet [42] hypothe-

(1) the number of (iris-like) constriction rings increased
from 1 → 2 → 3, (2) the ocelloid increased in size, and (3)
the position of the ocelloid gradually shifted toward the
anterior end of the cell (Table 2, Figure 5). We have
extended this hypothesis by incorporating the following
events: (4) the presence of nematocysts is an ancestral
state that was subsequently lost in more derived lineages,
(5) the piston was gained in the most recent ancestor of
Erythropsidinium and Greuetodinium, and (6) the lense
region or 'hyalosome' of the ocelloid was multiplied in
the most recent ancestor of Greuetodinium (Figure 5).
Moreover, because Nematodinium armatum contains
nematocysts and is the only known photosynthetic species, we hypothesize that photosynthesis involving typical
peridinin-containing dinoflagellate plastids is an ancestral state for warnowiids that was subsequently lost early
in the history of the clade (Figure 5). Mornin and Francis
[35] wrote that the plastids of N. armatum lack thylakoids,
which would preclude photosynthesis; however, one of
the TEM images published in this study (namely, Figure
"a" on plate III) shows a plastid with many thylakoids.
Because the relatively low magnification of this image
does not allow us to determine whether the plastids have
the usual dinoflagellate morphology (i.e., thylakoids in
stacks of three and three outer membranes), an ultrastructural reinvestigation of this species is needed.
The species from which we were able to acquire SSU- and
LSU-rDNA sequences represent only a part of the morphological diversity found in warnowiid dinoflagellates.
All of the species we examined possessed an ocelloid
located near the posterior end of the cell, which is inferred
to be an ancestral state for the group. However, one species, namely 'Proterythropsis' sp., possessed nematocysts,
and one species, namely 'Nematodinium' sp., was photosynthetic. Interestingly, the taxa without nematocysts,
namely 'Nematodinium' sp. and Warnowia sp. (British
Columbia), clustered together in the phylogenies inferred
from SSU rDNA sequences, albeit with weak support (Figure 3); these taxa also clustered together in the phylogeneis inferred from LSU rDNA sequences, but they were the
only two warnowiid species in the analyses (Figure 4 and
Additional files 1 and 2). The "Warnowia sp." (Florida)
showed the most divergent position in the phylogenies
inferred from SSU rDNA sequences and clustered strongly
with environmental sequences (Figure 3). Although all of
these results are consistent with the hypothetical framework(s) shown in Figure 5, SSU- and LSU-rDNA
sequences from relatively scarce planktonic warnowiids –
like Warnowia morphotype II, Erythropsidinium, and
Greuetodinium – will be required to more comprehensively evaluate character evolution within the group.

Taxonomic considerations
A survey of the literature on warnowiids reveals several
taxonomic problems associated with the genera Warnowia, Nematodinium, and Proterythropsis (Table 2). For
instance, Warnowia currently contains two very different
morphotypes with respect to the cingulum, sulcus, acrobase(s), and the position of the ocelloid [24,29,36,37]
(Table 2). Species in the genus are characterized by the
absence of features, such as plastids, nematocysts, pistons,
and posterior cell extensions (Table 2). Warnowia morphotype I is similar to Nematodinium armatum, and the
cells of Warnowia morphotype II are distinctively elongated (Figure 5). Nematodinium species also show a wide
range of cingulum and sulcus morphologies, but are
defined by the presence of nematocysts and a posterior
ocelloid and the absence of a posterior cell extension
(Table 2). However, Hulburt [49] reported specimens of
Nematodinium armatum without nematocysts. These cells

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/116

also fit the circumscription of Warnowia type I, but they
are photosynthetic [34,35,49]. The genus Proterythropsis is
recognized by the presence of a posterior cell extension
and is circumscribed as having a posterior ocelloid and
nematocysts (Table 2, Figure 5) [36,38]; however, Kofoid
and Swezy [36] reported Proterythropsis cells without
nematocysts. Therefore, it is unclear whether nematocysts
are a stable taxonomic character at any level in the phylogenetic hierarchy. In fact, it is not even clear whether all
specimens of a species possess nematocysts during all
stages of their life cycle or whether there are situations
when nematocysts are simply unrecognizable with light
microscopy during some developmental stages [e.g.,
[29]].
Species concepts within warnowiids are also highly problematic. It has been shown that the structure, color and
position of the ocelloid can change during the course of

cell development and division [37] (also see our Figures
1a and 1d of the same species). Because of this variability,
many previously described species probably represent
conspecifics [e.g., [36-38]].
These taxonomic ambiguities have made the identification of warnowiid genera and species extremely challenging for us when isolating cells from natural samples.
Therefore, in this study, we have decided not to name the
taxa to the species level and to demarcate ambiguous
genus assignments with quotation marks. Our 'Proterythropsis' sp. has a relatively short posterior cell 'extension'
and nematocysts (Figures 1a, b, c, d, e and 1f); it essentially possesses morphological features that are intermediate between Proterythropsis sensu stricto and heterotrophic
Nematodinium cells. Although our 'Nematodinium' sp.
looks most like Nematodinium armatum, we were unable
to detect nematocysts (Figures 1m, n, o and 1p). It is possible that this species best represents an undescribed photosynthetic version of Warnowia morphotype I; however,
because these cells could also represent Nematodinium
armatum without detectible nematocysts, as observed by
Hulburt [49], we decided to tentatively assign this species
to Nematodinium. The "Warnowia sp." (Florida) (Figures 1j
and 1k) possessed morphological features that were intermediate between morphotypes I and II, but we are not
able to confirm the presence or absence of nematocysts;
only one specimen was available for our investigations.
The Warnowia sp. (British Columbia) possessed the morphological features of morphotype I (Figures 1g, h and 1i)
and divided within hyaline cysts. The genus Erythropsidinium was the easiest to identify due to the conspicuous piston and the anterior position of the ocelloid (Figures 1q
and 1r).
Warnowiid environmental sequences
The DNA sequences we report here demonstrate that warnowiid dinoflagellates have been unknowingly recorded
in previous environmental PCR surveys of biodiversity
(Figure 3, accession numbers represent environmental
sequences of uncultured eukaryotes with unknown morphology/identity). 'Proterythropsis' sp. or a very close relative (EF527120, Figure 2) was sequenced/detected in a
sample from Framvaren Fjord, Norway, in September
2005 (A. Behnke, pers. comm.). The sampled water was
anoxic with measurable H2S (unpublished data, A.
Behnke, pers. comm.). To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first report of a warnowiid from anoxic habitats. Relatives of "Warnowia sp." (Florida) were sequenced from
nanoplankton samples taken from Sargasso Sea eddies
(Armbrust et al. unpublished, from GenBank, acc. no.
AY664983 and AY665026). Four additional sequences of
that survey (Armbrust et al. unpublished, from GenBank,
acc. no. AY664911, AY664912, AY664914, and
AY664896) clustered together as sister lineage(s) to the
"Warnowia sp." (Florida) clade (Figure 3). How warnowi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/116

ids could be part of the nanoplankton fraction of a water
sample is difficult to explain with present data and might
indicate a more complex lifecycle involving nanoflagellated stages; all described species of warnowiids belong to
the microplankton (> 20 μm). Contamination of the nanoplankton sample with free-floating DNA from ruptured
microplanktonic organisms could also explain these findings. Nonetheless, the warnowiid environmental
sequences demonstrate previously undetected diversity in
the group and the sequences that we report here help provide cellular identities to these clades.

Conclusion
This study reports the first molecular phylogenetic data
from uncultivated warnowiid dinoflagellates collected
from both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, namely SSUand LSU-rDNA sequences from probably three different
genera of warnowiids ('Nematodinium', Warnowia and
'Proterythropsis'), and partial LSU-rDNA sequences from
three different species of polykrikoids (P. kofoidii, P. lebourae, and 'Pheopolykrikos' hartmannii). All of the investigated
species clustered within the Gymnodinium sensu stricto
(s.s.) clade with very strong support, which was concordant with comparative morphological data. The warnowiid
sequences clustered together in one well-supported clade,
which reinforced the ocelloid as the best synapomorphy
for this group. Comparative morphological data and
molecular phylogenetic data demonstrate that the
polykrikoid clade and the warnowiid clade are closely
related to each other, but the precise branching order
within the Gymnodinium s.s. clade remains unresolved.
Nonetheless, the most parsimonious scenario of character
evolution suggests that the most recent common ancestor
of polykrikoids and warnowiids possessed nematocysts,
and probably photosynthetic plastids, that were subsequently lost during the early evolution of the warnowiid
clade. Species and genus concepts in warnowiids are
highly problematic and a comprehensive taxonomic revision is needed in order to better understand the evolutionary history of the group. However, additional
molecular and morphological data is severely hindered by
the extraordinary rarity that these planktonic dinoflagellates are encountered in natural samples. Accordingly, this
study represents a first step toward meeting these aims
and provides a set of preliminary DNA barcodes for warnowiids that not only helps advance the systematics of the
group, but also improves inferences about the evolutionary history that gave rise to some of the most sophisticated
organelles ever discovered in eukaryotic cells: ocelloids.
