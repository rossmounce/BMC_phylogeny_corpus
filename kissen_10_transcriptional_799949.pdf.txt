Abstract
Background: Glutamate plays a central position in the synthesis of a variety of organic molecules in plants and is
synthesised from nitrate through a series of enzymatic reactions. Glutamate synthases catalyse the last step in this
pathway and two types are present in plants: NADH- or ferredoxin-dependent. Here we report a genome wide
microarray analysis of the transcriptional reprogramming that occurs in leaves and roots of the A. thaliana mutant
glu1-2 knocked-down in the expression of Fd-GOGAT1 (GLU1; At5g04140), one of the two genes of A. thaliana
encoding ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase.
Results: Transcriptional profiling of glu1-2 revealed extensive changes with the expression of more than 5500
genes significantly affected in leaves and nearly 700 in roots. Both genes involved in glutamate biosynthesis and
transformation are affected, leading to changes in amino acid compositions as revealed by NMR metabolome
analysis. An elevated glutamine level in the glu1-2 mutant was the most prominent of these changes. An unbiased
analysis of the gene expression datasets allowed us to identify the pathways that constitute the secondary
response of an FdGOGAT1/GLU1 knock-down. Among the most significantly affected pathways, photosynthesis,
photorespiratory cycle and chlorophyll biosynthesis show an overall downregulation in glu1-2 leaves. This is in
accordance with their slight chlorotic phenotype. Another characteristic of the glu1-2 transcriptional profile is the
activation of multiple stress responses, mimicking cold, heat, drought and oxidative stress. The change in
expression of genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis is also revealed. The expression of a substantial number of
genes encoding stress-related transcription factors, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, glutathione S-transferases
and UDP-glycosyltransferases is affected in the glu1-2 mutant. This may indicate an induction of the detoxification
of secondary metabolites in the mutant.
Conclusions: Analysis of the glu1-2 transcriptome reveals extensive changes in gene expression profiles revealing
the importance of Fd-GOGAT1, and indirectly the central role of glutamate, in plant development. Besides the
effect on genes involved in glutamate synthesis and transformation, the glu1-2 mutant transcriptome was
characterised by an extensive secondary response including the downregulation of photosynthesis-related
pathways and the induction of genes and pathways involved in the plant response to a multitude of stresses.

Background
Nitrogen is an important nutrient for plants and a limiting factor in plant development. It is mainly in the form
of nitrate through nitrate transporters that nitrogen is
taken up by plants. Nitrate is first reduced to nitrite and
subsequently to ammonium through the action of
nitrate reductase (EC 1.7.1.1) and nitrite reductase (EC
1.7.7.1), respectively. Glutamine synthetase (EC 6.3.2.1)
catalyses the incorporation of this ammonium into glutamate and thereby producing glutamine. Subsequently,
glutamate synthase transfers the amide amino group of
glutamine to 2-oxoglutarate, yielding two molecules of
glutamate. Production of glutamate is a key point in the
synthesis of a variety of organic molecules, such as
nucleic acids, amino acids and secondary metabolites
(for review: [1]; Figure 1).
Besides the function in primary nitrogen assimilation,
the GS/GOGAT pathway plays a central role in the reassimilation of ammonium produced by photorespiration (for
review: [2]). Photorespiration is a photosynthesis-related
pathway where O2 is taken up and CO2 is released due to
the oxygenation of ribulose-1,5-biphosphate (RuBP) catalysed by RuBP carboxylase/oxygenase [3].
Plants possess two forms of glutamate synthase, which
are both localized in plastids. One uses NADH as electron donor and is commonly called NADH-GOGAT
(EC 1.4.1.14; GOGAT for “glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase”). The other one uses ferredoxin as electron donor and is called Fd-GOGAT (EC 1.4.7.1)(for

review: [4]). In Arabidopsis thaliana, NADH-GOGAT is
encoded by a single gene (At5g53460) whereas FdGOGAT is encoded by two genes, previously called
GLU1 (Fd-GOGAT1, At5g04140) and GLU2 (FdGOGAT2, At2g41220)[5]. The two genes encoding FdGOGAT in A. thaliana show contrasting patterns of
expression, with Fd-GOGAT1 expression being highest
in leaves, whereas Fd-GOGAT2 is mostly expressed in
roots [5,6]. Total glutamate synthase activity in A. thaliana is to a very large extent due to ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase, Fd-GOGAT1 contributing
most [5,7]. Fd-GOGAT1 and Fd-GOGAT2 expression is
also regulated differently: light causes a dramatic
increase in Fd-GOGAT1 whereas Fd-GOGAT2 expression is not or only slightly affected. Similarly, FdGOGAT1 but not Fd-GOGAT2 expression is induced by
sucrose [5]. Both Fd-GOGATs are localized to plastids
but a mitochondrial localisation of Fd-GOGAT1 has
also recently been shown [8].
Plants deficient in Fd-GOGAT activity have been
described in A. thaliana, under several names (gluS [9],
gltS [7], gls [5], glu1 [8]), and in other species such as
barley and tobacco [10,11]. A chlorotic phenotype and a
lethal phenotype under photorespiratory conditions,
which indicate the importance of glutamate synthase in
the respiratory pathway, are characteristic for FdGOGAT mutants [5,9].
The aim of the study was to characterise the transcriptional reprogramming that occurs in an A. thaliana
mutant named glu1-2, knocked-down in the expression
of Fd-GOGAT1 (GLU1; At5g04140) and to relate this to
metabolic and phenotypic changes observed for this
mutant.
We report here the genome wide transcriptional analysis by microarray and the metabolic profiling by NMR
spectroscopy of in vitro grown glu1-2 mutant plantlets.
These analyses identified substantial reprogramming of
several pathways and processes in the mutant. These
include primary and secondary nitrogen assimilation,
leading to changes in the levels of certain amino acid,
and photosynthesis related processes. The mutant was
also affected in flavonoid biosynthesis and exhibited
extensive transcriptional changes indicating the induction of multiple stress responses.

Results and Discussion
Phenotype of the glu1-2 mutant

An A. thaliana mutant presenting a T-DNA insertion in
the Fd-GOGAT1 (GLU1, GLS1; At5g04140) gene was
used in the present study. This mutant will hence be
referred to as glu1-2 mutant hereafter. Under the in
vitro growth conditions that were used in the present
study, glu1-2 mutant plants exhibited a moderate

Global overview and comparison of gene datasets that
are affected in the Fd-GOGAT1 mutant leaves and roots

Changes in gene expression in leaves and roots of 18
day old in vitro grown A. thaliana glu1-2 plantlets were
analysed using a genome wide microarray approach.
This analysis showed that the expression of a high number of genes was affected in the glu1-2 mutant. Only
genes whose expression was identified as being significantly changed at P = 0.01 were retained.
With 5615 genes whose expression were significantly
affected (either induced or repressed) in leaves versus
687 genes in roots, there was an 8-fold difference in the
number of affected genes between the two organs
(Table 1). This was most likely due to the fact that FdGOGAT1, as opposed to Fd-GOGAT2 and NADHGOGAT, has a much lower expression in roots than in
leaves, which will be discussed later on. Some probes

each organ the ratio between number of induced and the
number of repressed genes was only slightly biased
towards induction (1.09 in leaves and 1.27 in roots).

affected genes in leaves varied between 6.41 and -5.73
whereas that in roots was much more moderate with a
variation between 1.71 and -2.61 (Additional file 1).
In glu1-2 mutant leaves, 2865 of the 2957 (almost 97%)
induced genes were exclusively affected in this tissue
(Figure 3). The 92 genes whose expression was also
affected in roots, were almost equally distributed
between induced (50) and repressed (42). genes. Among
the 2708 genes repressed in leaves, 2540 (almost 94%)
were only affected in leaves. Of the remaining 168 genes
that are repressed in leaves and affected in roots, there
is a clear bias towards induction. In glu1-2 roots, 228
out of 384 (over 59%) induced genes and 199 out of 303
(over 65%) repressed genes were exclusively affected in
this tissue. Among the remaining genes, which were
also affected in leaves, the induced ones were more prevalent than the repressed ones, irrespective of whether
they were up-or down-regulated in leaves.
Analysis of overrepresented gene ontologies and affected
pathways among affected genes in the glu1-2 mutant
indicates a reprogramming of several biological processes

As seen above, a large number of genes are affected in
the glu1-2 mutant, notably the leaves, which indicates
that a profound transcriptional reprogramming takes
place. The schematic representation by Mapman [12]

illustrates to what extent different cellular processes and
metabolic pathways are affected in the glu1-2 mutant
(Figure 4). In order to identify the most relevant ones,
an unbiased analysis of affected gene ontologies (GOs)
and pathways was performed.
An analysis of overrepresented GO terms of the “biological process” classification using GOstat [13](P = 0.01
level with FDR/Benjamini correction) on the different
glu1-2 transcriptional datasets was performed. The
results of this analysis are shown in detail in Additional
file 2 and summarised below.
When this analysis is applied to the genes whose
expression is affected in glu1-2 leaves, not discriminating
between induced and repressed ones, 54 overrepresented
GO_biological_process terms are identified. When the
datasets are separated into genes induced or repressed in
glu1-2 leaves, 73 and 19 overrepresented GO terms are
identified respectively. In comparison, only 13 GO_biological_process terms are overrepresented among the
affected (induced or repressed) genes in glu1-2 roots.
Analysis on glu1-2 root-induced and -repressed genes
separately identifies 34 and 0 overrepresented GO_biological_process terms, respectively. When combining
expression patterns from leaves and roots 2 GO_biological_process terms are overrepresented among affected
genes, while the subset of genes downregulated in leaves
and upregulated in roots reveals three additional overrepresented GO_biological_processes. Two terms are overrepresented among genes induced in both organs of the
glu1-2 mutant (Additional file 2).
Hence, GOstat identifies in total 124 unique GO_biological_process terms (confounded levels) that are overrepresented in the glu1-2 transcriptional profile changes
(Additional file 2). Analysis with two further algorithms,
PathExpress [14] and GeneBins [15], gave overlapping
results to the ones obtained by GOstat as to which biological processes and pathways are affected in the glu1-2
mutant. These results are therefore not further detailed
in the text but are shown in Additional files 3 and 4.
Visualisation of the networks of GO terms that are
enriched in the glu1-2 mutant versus wild-type, using
the Cytoscape [16] plug-in ClueGO [17], illustrates the
complexity of the transcriptional response in glu1-2
mutant leaves (Figures 5 and 6). Notably, among genes
upreglated in glu1-2 leaves GO terms related to metabolic processes of nitrogen and carbohydrate compounds (Figure 5), the regulation of transcription and
the response to a diversity of stimuli are overrepresented. GO categories related to the latter two are also
overrepresented among downregulated genes in glu1-2
leaves, in addition to photosynthesis and pigment/porphyrin biosynthesis (Figure 6). Although the complexity
of GO-term networks enriched in the glu1-2 mutant
roots versus wild-type roots is reduced (Figure 7), the

networks with at least three nodes being represented. The node size represents the term enrichment significance. The label of the most
significant term is used as leading group term.

T-DNA insertion in Fd-GOGAT1 has nevertheless a
considerable impact on the root transcriptome as evidenced by the number of affected genes (i.e. 687) and
the affected GO-terms (Additional files 2 to 4).
The large number of genes with modified expression
and the analyses described above indicate that a large
number of pathways and processes are seemingly
affected in the glu1-2 mutant. Interestingly, glutamate
biosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism are not often

identified as such, and if so are indicated as induced in
leaves. However as these pathways most likely constitute
the plant’s primary response to the knock-down of FdGOGAT1, the expression data of genes involved in these
pathways will be analysed in a first part. In a second
part the focus will be put on some of the processes that,
despite the differences in algorithms and category definitions and terms, are recurrently identified by the performed analyses. These processes most likely constitute

compounds. This is complemented by analysis of certain
amino acid contents in the glu1-2 mutant.
Changes in expression levels of genes encoding glutamate
synthases and glutamine synthetases

Comparison of expression levels in our microarray assays
indicates that Fd-GOGAT1 (GLU1;At5g04140) is more
highly expressed in leaves than in roots (signal intensity:
log2 = 10.84 versus log2 = 5.06; Δlog2 = 5.78) of 18 day
old in vitro grown A. thaliana wild type plants (Col-0
ecotype) (Additional file 1). This is in accordance with
earlier published results and gene expression data publicly available [5,6,18,19]. As expected, the expression of
Fd-GOGAT1 (At5g04140) was downregulated in the
glu1-2 mutant (Table 2). There was a log2 ratio of -5.74
between the expression levels of Fd-GOGAT1 in leaves of
wild type and the mutant. In roots the difference was
more moderate with a reduction in expression of log2 =
-0.54 (only significant at P = 0.05). It should however be
noted that residual levels of transcripts for Fd-GOGAT1
are still detectable on the microarrays from the glu1-2
mutant, and that these are similar in roots and leaves.
The gene GLU2 (At2g41220) encoding Fd-GOGAT2,
the second A. thaliana Fd-dependent glutamate
synthase, is upregulated (log2 = 1.07) in leaves but not
affected in roots of the glu1-2 mutant. The NADHGOGAT (EC1.4.1.14) encoding gene At5g53460 is also
slightly upregulated (log2 = 0.71) in glu1-2 leaves but
not affected in roots (Table 2). This could indicate a
partial recovery of the loss of the plastid-localized

Fd-GOGAT1 by these enzymes in leaves as NADHGOGAT and Fd-GOGAT2 are localized to plastids.
Fd-GOGAT2 has however higher expression levels in
roots than in leaves and is therefore more likely involved
in primary nitrogen assimilation in roots [5]. In addition,
NADH-dependent glutamate synthase activity only
makes up a small percentage of the total glutamate
synthase activity in A. thaliana leaves and NADHdependent activity is not affected in Fd-GOGAT
deficient mutants [7,9]. It should also be noted that
posttranscriptional regulation has been hypothesised for
Fd-GOGAT in tobacco and A. thaliana [20,21].
Glutamine is the substrate of GOGATs for the synthesis of glutamate (Figure 8) and glutamine synthetases
(EC 6.3.1.2) catalyse the synthesis of glutamine from
ammonium (NH4+) using ATP. Of the five putative A.
thaliana genes encoding the cytoplasmic glutamine
synthetase 1 (GS1), two were upregulated (At5g37600/
GLN1.1 and At3g17820/GLN1.3) whereas one
(At5g16570/GLN1.4) was slightly downregulated in glu12 leaves. The gene At5g35630 encoding glutamine
synthetase 2 (GS2), which is dual-targeted to the plastid
and mitochondria [22], was not affected. None of the
genes encoding glutamine synthetases 1 or 2 were
affected in the roots of the glu1-2 mutant.
Genes encoding enzymes involved in the primary nitrogen
assimilation leading to the formation of glutamine and
glutamate

Glutamine and glutamate play a central role in the primary assimilation of nitrogen (Figure 1). Hence, genes
encoding enzymes catalysing the reactions leading to the
formation of glutamine from nitrate are affected in the
glu1-2 mutant (Table 2), mostly in leaves.

Some of the genes encoding nitrate reductase (NADHNAR; EC 1.7.1.1) and nitrite reductase (NIR1; EC
1.7.7.1), are upregulated in glu1-2 leaves while unaffected in glu1-2 roots. These enzymes are responsible
for the reduction of nitrate and nitrite respectively, leading to the formation of NH4+, which serves as substrate
by glutamine synthetase. The upregulation of nitrate
reductase expression levels was previously observed in
tobacco plants deficient in Fd-GOGAT activity [23].
Glutamine and aspartate are used as substrates for the
synthesis of glutamate and asparagine, in an ATPdependent reaction catalysed by asparagine synthase
(ASN; EC 6.3.5.4)(for review: [24]). Of the three A. thaliana genes encoding asparagine synthases, two were
downregulated in glu1-2 leaves but none was affected in
roots (Table 2). ASN1 (At3g47340) is one of the ten
most downregulated genes in the glu1-2 mutant leaves.
It has been shown that ASN1 is induced by dark and
reduced by light (or sucrose) while ASN2, which is moderately downregulated, is induced by light. These two
genes also respond differently to asparagine, glutamine
and glutamate with ASN1 expression being induced and
ASN2 expression being reduced ([24] and references
therein). Overexpressing ASN1 leads to higher asparagine levels in seeds and phloem [25] and Masclaux-Daubresse et al. [21] have recently shown that asparagine
synthase can also catalyse the formation of asparagine
from aspartate using ammonium directly. None of the
four genes encoding asparaginases (EC 3.5.1.1), which
are responsible of degrading asparagine into aspartate,
were affected in the leaves of the glu1-2 mutant (Figure
8). Hence, the reduced expression of asparagine synthase
encoding genes in glu1-2 leaves could indicate lower
levels of asparagine. In Fd-GOGAT deficient barley
plants, the levels of asparagine are however higher than
in wild-type plants [10].
Multiple pathways leading to the transformation and
degradation of glutamate are also affected

Glutamate serves directly or indirectly as substrate in
the production of a series of compounds, like amino
acids, nucleic acids, ureides, and polyamines (Figure 1;
[26]). Hence, reducing Fd-GOGAT1 expression could
have a knock-on effect on the genes encoding enzymes
implicated in these various biosynthetic pathways
(Figure 8).
Amino acid biosynthesis

Aspartate aminotransferases (ASPs or AATs; EC 2.6.1.1)
catalyse the transfer of the a-amino group of glutamate
to oxaloacetate to form aspartate and 2-oxoglutarate. In
glu1-2 leaves, four of the five A. thaliana genes (putatively) encoding ASPs [26] are upregulated in glu1-2
leaves. Aspartate is a precursor of asparagine and the

Page 12 of 31

aspartate family of amino acids such as lysine, threonine
and methionine (Figure 8). From the changes in expression levels of genes involved in these pathways the
synthesis of these latter amino acids seems to be
induced in glu1-2 leaves.
The transfer of the a-amino group of glutamate to
pyruvate to form alanine is catalysed by alanine aminotransferases (AlaAT or AOAT; EC 2.6.1.2) which comprise four members, subdivided into two groups, in A.
thaliana [27]. The first group, composed of AlaAT1 and
AlaAT2 that possess alanine aminotransferase activity, is
slightly induced in leaves but not in roots of the glu1-2
mutant (Table 2). AlaAT1 has recently been suggested
to catalyse the reverse reaction (i.e. conversion of alanine to pyruvate) [28], which could lead to a production
of glutamate (Figure 8) to compensate for the lack of
Fd-GOGAT1. Low levels of glutamate may shift this
reaction equilibrium to favour glutamate production.
The members of the second group, two peroxisomal
enzymes, possess a glycine (or glutamate:glyoxylate)
aminotransferase (GGAT) activity in addition to their
alanine aminotransferase activity (Figure 8). Glyoxylate
is thereby transaminated to glycine, accompanied by the
consumption of glutamate and the production of 2-oxoglutarate, during photorespiration. Neither of these two
genes is affected in glu1-2 roots (Table 2) but the
expression of GGAT2 (At1g70580) is reduced in glu1-2
leaves. The further conversion of glycine to serine
involves the glycine decarboxylase complex (GDC) and
serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT; EC 2.1.2.1).
The glycine decarboxylase complex is composed of four
mitochondrial proteins (H, L, P and T) encoded by a
total of eight genes in A. thaliana [29]. The genes
encoding the two P proteins are both downregulated
(Table 2). Knocking out these genes simultaneously provokes a lethal phenotype, also under nonphotorespiratory conditions, which points towards a role of GDC in
other metabolic processes than photorespiration [30]. Of
the seven A. thaliana genes putatively encoding serine
hydroxymethyltransferases, four show a changed expression in glu1-2 leaves (Table 2). SHM1 (At4g37930)
encoding the mitochondrial SHMT1 is downregulated.
Interestingly, the knock-out mutant shm1-1 also displays
a lethal photorespiratory phenotype [31] and a physical
interaction between Fd-GOGAT1 and SHMT1 in mitochondria was recently established [8]. Three genes
encoding putative cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferases were on the other hand almost equally upregulated in leaves. None of the SHMT-encoding genes was
affected in glu1-2 roots (Table 2).
Arginine is formed from glutamate and glutamine in a
multiple-reaction pathway [32] that shows a slight overall induction in glu1-2 mutant leaves (Figure 8; Table 2).

Kissen et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:190
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/190

This may be responsible for increased production of
arginine that has been observed in Fd-GOGAT deficient
plants and which may prevent excessive accumulation of
glutamine [11]. In root tissue of the glu1-2 mutant none
of the transcripts of these genes involved in arginine
synthesis were affected.
Valine biosynthesis starts with the condensation of
two molecules of pyruvate by acetohydroxyacid synthase
(AHAS; EC 2.2.1.6), also known as acetolactate synthase
[33]. Neither the gene At3g48560 encoding the catalytic
subunit, nor the genes At2g31810 and At5g16290 encoding the regulatory subunit, are significantly affected in
the glu1-2 mutant (Figure 8). The resulting 2-acetolactate is converted to 2,3-dihydroxy-3-isovalerate by ketolacid reductoisomerase (KARI; EC 1.1.1.86) and its gene
At3g58610 is slightly upregulated in glu1-2 leaves. The
gene At3g23940 encoding dehydroxyacid dehydratase
(DHAD; EC 4.2.1.9), which catalyses the conversion of
2,3-dihydroxy-3-isovalerate to a-ketoisovalerate, is also
induced in glu1-2 leaves. Branched-chain aminotransferases (BCAT; EC 2.6.1.42) catalyse the subsequent and
last step in the synthesis of valine from a-ketoisovalerate, which is accompanied by the conversion of glutamate to 2-oxoglutarate. However none of the BCATencoding genes (At1g10070, At3g49680 and At5g65780)
implicated in this step is affected in the glu1-2 mutant.
Hence, a few of the genes encoding biosynthetic
enzymes involved in valine biosynthesis are induced,
indicating possibly a slight activation of the valine biosynthetic pathway.
Glutathione biosynthesis

Glutamate is used for the synthesis of glutathione in a
two-reaction pathway (Figure 8) catalysed by glutamatecysteine ligase (GSH1; EC 6.3.2.2) and glutathione
synthetase (GSH2; EC 6.3.2.3). Both GSH1 (At4g23100)
and GSH2 (At5g27380) are upregulated in glu1-2
mutant leaves (Table 2). Mutants deficient in GSH1
have been shown to contain lower levels of glutathione
and are more sensitive to stresses. Complete knock-out
of GSH1 leads to an embryo-lethal phenotype [34].
Upregulation of glutathione biosynthetic genes in glu1-2
may be connected to the upregulation of numerous glutathione S-transferases (see later).
Gamma-aminobutyrate and succinate synthesis

Under certain conditions glutamate may be converted to
gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) in a cytosolic reaction
catalysed by glutamate decarboxylase (GAD; EC
4.1.1.15). The two GAD-encoding genes GAD1
(At5g17330) and GAD2 (At1g65960) initially identified
in A. thaliana [35,36] are not affected in the leaves or
roots of the glu1-2 mutant. Of the three additional
genes encoding putative GADs that have recently been

Page 13 of 31

identified based on homology [37], GAD3 and/or GAD4
(undifferentiating probe) were upregulated in glu1-2
mutant leaves (Table 2). The gene encoding GABA-T1
(EC 2.6.1.19; At3g22200), the g-aminobutyric acid transaminase that catalyses the conversion of GABA into
succinic semialdehyde (SSA), simultaneously producing
alanine from pyruvate, is also induced in leaves. The
conversion of SSA to succinate by succinic semialdehyde
dehydrogensase (SSADH) is also upregulated in glu1-2
leaves (Table 2).
Glutamate catabolism

Glutamate is catabolised into oxoglutarate and ammonium by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH; EC 1.4.1.2)
(Figure 8), a mitochondrial enzyme that exists under the
form of homo- or heterohexamers of two subunits in A.
thaliana [38]. Only GDH2 (At5g07440), encoding the bsubunit, is affected in the glu1-2 mutant, showing surprisingly an increased expression in mutant leaves
(Table 2). Although the role of glutamate dehydrogenase
in glutamate metabolism has remained controversial for
a long time, recent evidence indicates that GDHs are
indeed responsible for the deamination of glutamate
leading to the formation of ammonium and 2-oxoglutarate [21,39]. Induction of GDH2 expression could hence
lead to a further depletion of the pool of glutamate in
the glu1-2 mutant but would simultaneously increase
the levels of oxoglutarate to fuel the TCA cycle.
Although the physiological role of GDH is currently still
unclear, there seems to be a consensus that GDH is not
essential for primary nitrogen assimilation. Instead a
role of GDH in the breakdown of several amino acids
into their corresponding keto-acids under carbon deficiency was proposed [39]. The the a- and b-subunit
composition of glutamate dehydrogenase hexamers may
also influence its activity and hence its physiological role
[40]. Lancien et al. [41] proposed that ammonium and
glutamine would favour the amination reaction. In
tobacco plants with reduced Fd-GOGAT activity the
aminating, but not the deaminating activity, of glutamate dehydrogenase was indeed reported [42].
Cellular uptake of glutamate

Amino acids can be exported from their site of synthesis
and transported via the vascular tissue to newly developed tissues. In A. thaliana, glutamate is one of the predominant amino acids found in the phloem sap and
xylem exudates [18]. Members of the A. thaliana amino
acid permease (AAP) family have been shown to catalyse the low affinity influx of a broad range of amino
acids, including glutamate [43]. Of these, AAP1
(At1g58360), AAP4 (At5g63850) and AAP6 (At5g49630)
were moderately downregulated, whereas AAP5
(At1g44100) was induced in glu1-2 leaves (Additional

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/190

file 1). AAP1 has recently been shown to be involved in
glutamate uptake into root cells and may have a role in
the efficient use of nitrogen resources in the rhizosphere
[44], but its expression was not affected in glu1-2 roots.
Only AAP4 (At5g63850) was affected in roots, with a
lower expression in the mutant than in the wild-type.
The related LHT1 (At5g40780) gene which appears to
encode a high-affinity glutamate influx system [45] was
also moderately downregulated in glu1-2 roots but not
affected in glu1-2 leaves. A role for LHT1 in root uptake
of certain amino acids was also recently proposed, but
its role in glutamate uptake may be limited as this was
not affected in an lht1 mutant [46].
The gene At2g01170 encoding the recently identified
bidirectional amino acid transporter BAT1 capable of
import and export of glutamate and potentially involved
in amino acid export from phloem to sink tissue [47] is
moderately induced in glu1-2 leaves and not affected in
roots.

4.2.1.2) were downregulated in glu1-2 leaves. Interestingly, none of the TCA cycle-implicated genes mentioned above were significantly affected in glu1-2 roots.
These data indicate an overall induction of the TCA
cycle in glu1-2 leaves potentially leading to an increase
in 2-oxoglutarate production. Higher levels of 2-oxoglutarate have been observed in Fd-GOGAT deficient
tobacco plants [11].
2-oxoglutarate can also be synthesised in the cytosol
by export of citrate from mitochondria and the subsequent action of aconitases and isocitrate dehydrogenases. Two aconitase-encoding genes (ACO; EC
4.1.2.3) and two genes putatively encoding cytosolic
NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDCH; EC
1.1.1.42) are upregulated in glu1-2 leaves (Additional file
5). Although this could indicate an increase in cytosolic
2-oxoglutarate synthesis, it should however be noted
that a role of the latter in cytosolic 2-oxoglutarate production has not yet been established.

Changes in expression levels og genes involved in the
synthesis of 2-oxoglutarate and the TCA cycle

Uptake, transport and distribution of nitrate and
ammonium

The synthesis of glutamate by NADH- and Fd-GOGATs
necessitates 2-oxoglutarate, which is thus situated at the
interface between C and N metabolism. As it is possible
to affect the glutamate pool by feeding 2-oxoglutarate to
plants, the supply of 2-oxoglutarate may be a key regulator of glutamate levels [48].
2-oxoglutarate is produced through the TCA cycle
(for review: [41]) and several genes involved in the
TCA cycle were upregulated in glu1-2 leaves (Figure 8;
Additional file 5). These include genes encoding citrate
synthase (CSY; EC2.3.3.1), succinate dehydrogenases
(SDH; EC 1.3.5.1) and succinyl-CoA ligase (EC 6.2.1.4).
Three of the five genes encoding NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH; EC 1.1.1.41) subunits are
also upregulated in glu1-2 mutant leaves (Figure 8;
Additional file 5). This increase in IDH transcript
levels in the glu1-2 mutant is in contrast to the situation observed in tobacco plants with reduced FdGOGAT activity, where no change in transcript levels
was observed. These tobacco plants did however show
increased isocitrate dehydrogenase activity [42].
Recently, Lemaitre et al. [49] have shown that mutants
lacking one of the three IDH subunits mentioned
above do not exhibit changed levels in 2-oxoglutarate,
glutamine and glutamate. The glu1-2 mutant leaves
also showed an increase in the expression of four
genes encoding putative components (EC 2.3.1.61 and
EC 1.2.4.2) of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase system. On the other hand, the genes At2g47510/
At5g50950 encoding fumarate hydratases (FUM; EC

Fd-GOGAT1 is a key enzyme in the primary assimilation of nitrogen and knocking it down was expected to
change the transcriptional level of genes involved in
nitrogen uptake and transport (Table 2).
The NRT1 and NRT2 nitrate transporter families [50]
were however only marginally affected. Of the 53 genes
that encode putative NRT1 nitrate transporters in A.
thaliana, five were induced in glu1-2 leaves. Of these,
NRT1.1 (At1g12110) has been implicated in stomatal
aperture and drought stress [51] and its NO3- sensing
role in root architecture was recently described [52].
NRT1.5 (At1g32450) and NRT 1.7 (At1g69870) are less
well characterised but have been shown to transport
nitrate in a heterologous system [50]. The latter of these
genes is also slightly induced in glu1-2 roots. On the
other hand, eight genes encoding putative NRT1 family
members, such as the NRT1.3/NTP3 (At3g21670; [53]),
are downregulated in glu1-2 leaves. Out of the seven
NRT2-encoding genes, only At5g14570 (NRT2.7) was
moderately induced in glu1-2 leaves (Table 2).
An essential role in nitrate uptake has also recently
been shown for the NAR2-like protein [54,55]. The gene
NRT3.1/NAR2.1 (At5g50200) encoding this protein is
induced in glu1-2 leaves (Table 2). None of the genes
implicated in nitrate uptake and transport mentioned
above was affected in glu1-2 roots.
The ammonium transporter (AMT) proteins, which are
encoded by six genes in A. thaliana, are likely responsible
for high affinity ammonium transport in plant roots [56].
The gene At2g38290 encoding the ammonium

Kissen et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:190
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/190

Page 15 of 31

transporter AMT2;1 was upregulated in glu1-2 leaves
(Table 2), but its contribution to ammonium uptake in
planta has been questioned recently [57].
The nitrate/proton antiporter AtCLCa mediates
nitrate accumulation in vacuoles [58,59] and its encoding gene At5g40890 is down-regulated in glu1-2 leaves
(Table 2). Several NRT1 gene-encoding proteins are
claimed to be involved in nitrate distribution in different
cellular compartments and tissues, but detailed evidence
has not been provided yet [50].
Two vacuolar tonoplast intrinsic proteins (AtTIP2;1
and AtTIP2;3) have been proposed to be responsible for
NH 3 transport across the tonoplast membrane in A.
thaliana [60]. AtTIP2;1 (At3g16240) is downregulated in
glu1-2 leaves, whereas AtTIP2;3 (At5g47450) is downregulated in glu1-2 roots (Table 2).
NMR analysis of glu1-2 mutant leaves and roots reveal
differences in amino acid contents

Although the Fd-GOGAT deficient gluS/gls mutants did
not seem to be impaired in primary nitrogen assimilation
[9], it was later shown that Fd-GOGAT1/GLU1 indeed
plays a role in primary nitrogen metabolism [5]. As
described above, knocking down Fd-GOGAT1 in the
glu1-2 mutant affected several genes involved in primary
nitrogen assimilation but the effects at the transcriptional
level were more moderate than expected. Metabolite analysis by NMR spectroscopy of glu1-2 mutant tissue was
performed to assess metabolic changes in the mutant.
Using this technique, the four amino acids alanine,
threonine, valine and glutamine were identified and
some changes in their levels in the glu1-2 mutant were
revealed (Table 3; Figure 9). Most importantly glutamine
contents were increased more than eight-fold in glu1-2
leaves and more than two-fold in glu1-2 roots. This
indicates that the loss of Fd-GOGAT1 is not compensated by Fd-GOGAT2 or NADH-GOGAT activity in the
glu1-2 mutant. The fact that the latter two enzymes are
more active in roots than in leaves [7] is consistent with

a smaller increase in glutamine levels in glu1-2 roots
than in leaves. Higher glutamine contents have been
previously described for Fd-GOGAT deficient plants of
A. thaliana, barley and tobacco [9-11,61]. Principal
component analysis (PCA) of the NMR spectra indicates
that glutamine is to a large extent responsible of the
changes detected between the wild-type and the glu1-2
mutant (Figure 9A, left panel). PC1 explains 79% of the
total explained variance in leaf samples and allows to
discriminate between glu1-2 and wild-type leaf samples
(Figure 9A, right panel). Conversely to the increase in
glutamine, the levels of glutamate are expected to be
reduced in the glu1-2 mutant. Reduced levels of glutamate have been described for Fd-GOGAT deficient barley and A. thaliana plants [10,61,62]. The levels of
valine were also considerably increased in glu1-2 leaves,
consistent with previous reports on Fd-GOGAT deficient tobacco plants ([11]; Figure 9B). This is however
difficult to explain by the transcriptional profiling of the
glu1-2 mutant. Indeed, only two genes of the valine biosynthetic pathway are slightly upregulated (Figure 8;
Table 2) and genes involved in the degradation of valine
are not affected. In addition, the diversion of this pathway towards leucine biosynthesis via the use of a-ketoisovalerate seems rather upregulated than downregulated
(data not shown). Alanine content was reduced in glu12 leaves and increased in glu1-2 roots, although the
changes were more moderate (Figure 9B). This could be
related to the decrease in glutamate levels and increased
reverse alanine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase activity,
i.e. the conversion of alanine to pyruvate (Figure 8).
Reduced foliar levels of alanine have previously been
observed in Fd-GOGAT deficient barley and tobacco
plants [11,61]. Threonine levels were only affected in
glu1-2 leaves, showing a slight reduction (Figure 9B). In
Fd-GOGAT deficient tobacco plants the levels of foliar
alanine and threonine were respectively reduced and
unaffected [11]. The reduced levels of alanine and threonine in glu1-2 leaves are accompanied by an overall
upregulation in gene expression in the biosynthetic
pathways of these amino acids (Figure 8). Other amino
acids were not identified by NMR, but changes in
several amino acids have been previously reported in
Fd-GOGAT deficient plants [10,11].
Analysis with PathExpress identified starch and
sucrose metabolism as being downregulated in leaves
and roots of the glu1-2 mutant (see above). This is not
surprising considering the close interaction between C
and N metabolism through the GS/GOGAT cycle. Differences in the contents of sucrose and glucose were
not observed by NMR spectroscopy of glu1-2 leaves and
roots (data not shown). This is consistent with results
from tobacco plants with reduced Fd-GOGAT activity
[42].

Secondary responses of the glu1-2 mutant revealed by
transcriptional profiling
Photosynthesis and related biochemical processes are
affected in glu1-2 mutant leaves

Photosynthesis and related biochemical processes were
recurrently identified in our unbiased search of affected
pathways (Additional files 2, 3 and 4). Especially the GO
term GO:0015979 (photosynthesis), and to a lesser
extent GO:0019684, GO:0042548 and GO:0042549, was
revealed by GOstat as being affected in several of our

datasets (Additional file 2). If only the GO terms related
to photosynthesis that were identified by GOstat as
being affected are taken into consideration, 37 genes
show different expression levels in glu1-2 leaves (Additional file 6). All but one of these are repressed and
the level of repression varies from log 2 = -0.32 to
-1.76. Although the TAIR database to some extent
categorises different genes into these GO terms, these
are also almost exclusively downregulated (Additional
file 6). If all genes included in GO:0015979 and its

Figure 10 Changes in gene expression in photosynthesis-related pathways of the glu1-2 mutant. Expression changes of genes involved
in photosynthesis in glu1-2 mutant leaves (left) and roots (right) using the MapMan software. Represented are only the genes showing a
significant (P = 0.01) change in expression between the glu1-2 mutant and the wild-type and that have been attributed to the respective bins
by MapMan. Genes whose expression is increased or decreased in the glu1-2 mutant tissue versus the corresponding wild-type tissue are shown
by an increasingly intense blue and red colour, respectively. The graduation can be seen on the scale that is represented in the centre of the
figure.

subcategories as provided by AmiGO are taken into
condiseration, the list contains 49 unique genes not
identified by GOstat whose expression is affected in
the glu1-2 mutant leaves. Of these only five genes are
(moderately) upregulated. The photosynthesis related
bins of the MapMan software (Figures 4 and 10) identify another 71 genes with changed expression in
glu1-2 leaves. All but ten of these are downregulated
(Additional file 6). Hence, a total of more than 150
genes attributed to photosynthesis related pathways are
affected in glu1-2 leaves, of which approximately 90%
are downregulated. In glu1-2 roots, 52 genes attributed
to the photosynthesis related GO terms or bins show a
differential expression and these are exclusively
induced (Additional file 6).
Several genes involved in the Calvin cycle are thus
affected in the glu1-2 mutant, with most of them being
downregulated in leaves and upregulated in roots (Figure 10). The most downregulated gene in the Calvin
cycle in glu1-2 leaves is encoding a putative fructosebiphosphate aldolase (At4g26530).

A process directly linked to photosynthesis and the
Calvin cycle is photorespiration, a consequence of the
oxygenation of ribulose-1,5-biphosphate (RuBP) by
RuBP carboxylase/oxygenase [3]. This oxygenation produces 3-phosphoglycerate and 2-phosphoglycolate, the
latter being recycled into 3-phosphoglycerate by the
photorespiratory cycle. In this process O2 is consumed
in the plastid and CO2 and ammonium are released in
the mitochondria. The released ammonium is reassimilated by the GS/GOGAT pathway in the plastid (for
review: [63]). The essential role that glutamate synthase
plays in this process is evidenced by the fact that
mutants deficient in Fd-GOGAT activity exhibit a
photorespiratory-dependent lethal phenotype [5,9].
Transcriptional profiling of the glu1-2 mutant indeed
shows that genes involved in most of the steps of the
photorespiratory cycle are downregulated in leaves
(Figure 11; Table 4). These include the genes encoding
phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGLP1; At5g36700) and
glycerate kinase (GLYK; At1g80380) of plastids and
mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHM1;

At4g37930). Knock-out mutants of these genes exhibit a
conditional lethal photorespiratory phenotype [31,64,65].
The gene At1g68010 encoding the peroxisomal NADHdependent hydroxypyruvate reductase HPR1 is downregulated in glu1-2 leaves with no concomitant change of
At1g79870 encoding the cytosolic isoform HPR2 that
provides a cytosolic bypass to the photorespiratory cycle
[66]. The gene encoding the dicarboxylate transporter
DiT2.2 is also repressed in glu1-2 leaves. Its role is yet
unclear, although the homolog DiT2.1 has been identified as a glutamate/malate translocator with an essential
role in photorespiration [67]. A notable exception to the

general downregulation of photorespiration-related
genes is At2g22500 encoding one of the three recently
characterised mitochondrial dicarboxylate carriers
(DIC1-3) that are able to transport malate and oxaloacetate among other substrates [68]. In glu1-2 roots the
expression of a smaller number of genes involved in
photorespiration is affected by the glu1-2 mutation, and
all these are upregulated (Table 4). It should also be
noted that the changes in expression levels for both
leaves and roots are moderate, which may explain the
fact that our glu1-2 mutant has a less severe photorespiratory phenotype than the Fd-GOGAT1 mutants

List of genes encoding enzymes involved in the photorespiratory pathway and whose expression is affected by knocking down Fd-GOGAT1 in the glu1-2 mutant.
See also Figure 11. The presence of two gene IDs in some boxes indicates a nondiscriminating probe, i.e. the change in expression can not be attributed to a
specific gene.

characterised previously [5,9]. In addition, Takahashi
et al. [69] showed that mutants impaired in photorespiration have accelerated photoinhibition of the photosystem II and that this is due to a suppressed repair
process through inhibition of the D1 protein translation.
Due to the dual-targeting of glutamine synthetase 2
(GS2) to the plastid and mitochondria [22], other
schemes of the reassimilation of ammonium than the
photorespiration cycle depicted (Figure 11) and discussed here, have been proposed [2].
Chlorophyll is synthesised from glutamate. Many of
the reactions of the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway
are downregulated (Figure 12), although the fold
changes in expression are moderate (Additional file 6).
However, two genes (At1g03630 and At5g54190) encoding protochlorophyllide reductases that catalyse the last
step leading to the synthesis of chlorophyllide a
(Figure 12), show a more pronounced downregulation.
Downregulation of genes implicated in chlorophyll biosynthesis and other photosynthesis related pathways,
such as photorespiration (discussed above), in glu1-2
mutant leaves are consistent with its chlorotic phenotype (Figure 2). A chlorotic phenotype has been
observed and reduced total chlorophyll contents have

been measured in Fd-GOGAT deficient plants of A.
thaliana, tobacco and barley [5,9,11,61]. Barley plants
with reduced Fd-GOGAT activity have also been shown
to have a reduced chlorophyll a/b ratio [61]. Takahashi
et al. [69] hypothesised that depletion of glutamate in
the Fd-GOGAT mutant may lead to accumulation of
glyoxylate that may be involved in a decline of the
photosynthetic rate.
The glu1-2 mutant displays a multiple stress response

Categorisation of genes affected in leaves and roots of
the glu1-2 mutant presented above showed a high number of genes related to stimulus and stress responses.
More detailed analysis of the affected genes revealed
that these changes in expression can not be attributed
to one particular stress. Indeed, genes responsive to a
multitude of different abiotic stresses, including light,
drought, salt, heat and cold, oxidative stress and osmotic
stress were affected (Additional file 2). This indicates
that knocking down Fd-GOGAT1 leads to a secondary
response that consists in the activation of multiple stress
responses or the activation of mechanisms that are common to several stresses. Due to the extensive nature of
these transcriptional responses, only a selection will be
presented briefly in the following section and the reader

details on the affected genes.
Key stress responsive transcription factors affected in
the glu1-2 mutant Numerous genes (putatively) encoding transcription factors belonging to different families,
such as the zinc finger proteins (WRKY, C2H2, CCCH),
MYBs and bHLHs (Additional file 7), were affected in
the glu1-2 mutant.
WRKY25, whose encoding gene At2g30250 showed
the highest induction of WRKY transcription factors in
glu1-2 leaves, has been implicated in the defence against
Pseudomonas syringae [70]. WRKY25 expression has
also been shown to be induced in response to heat
shock, wounding and oxidate stress. Higher levels of
WRKY25 transcripts were detected in cytosolic ascorbate
peroxidase Apx1-deficient plants, which maintain a high
steady state level of H 2 O 2 and activate ROS defence
mechanisms [71].
The C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor ZAT12
plays an important role in oxidative and abiotic stress
response [71-73] and its encoding gene At5g59820, is
upregulated in glu1-2 mutant leaves. ZAT12 expression
is, like WRKY25, induced by heat shock, wounding and
oxidate stress and higher transcripts were also detected
in cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase (Apx1)-deficient plants
[71]. ZAT12 expressing plants can tolerate oxidate stress
[71] and show an increased freezing tolerance [73].
The genes encoding the two MYB-related transcription factors LHY (At1g01060) and CCA1 (At2g46830),
which are associated with the circadian clock and act as
negative regulators of the periodic flowering pathway
[74], were strongly downregulated in glu1-2 leaves
respectively. A role of LHY and CCA1 in the response
to abiotic stresses has also been proposed [75].
Five genes (putatively) encoding bHLH transcription
factors were among the 5% most repressed genes in
glu1-2 leaves. While a role for BHLH101 (At5g04150)
has not been described yet, it is phylogenetically closely
linked to BHLH039 (At3g56980; [76]) which is also
strongly repressed in glu1-2 leaves. BHLH039 has been
shown to be downregulated by jasmonic acid (JA), and
induced by salicylic acid (SA) [77] and iron deficiency
[78]. It should be noted that these two transcription factors are also downregulated in glu1-2 roots.
DREB2C/DREB2H (dual probe At2g40340/At2g40350)
are highly upregulated AP2/ERF transcription factors in
glu1-2 leaves. DREB2C has been described as being heat
and drought inducible and overexpression confers thermotolerance to the plants. Analysis of these plants lead
the authors to hypothesise that DREB2C is a late regulator of genes under heat stress [79].
Flavonoid biosynthesis is affected in the glu1-2
mutant Flavonoids, which were revealed as affected in
the gene sets, are a class of compounds that act for

Figure 13 Changes in gene expression in the shikimate pathway of the glu1-2 mutant. Simplified schematic representation of the
shikimate pathway and the genes showing different expression levels in glu1-2 leaves and root. Gene IDs indicated in blue are upregulated
whereas those indicated in red are downregulated. Enzymes: (1) 3-deoxy-D-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS),
(2) 3-dehydroquinate synthase (DQS), (3) 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase/shikimate dehydrogenase (DHQD), (4) shikimate kinase,

example as protection against abiotic and biotic stresses
and their concentrations increase in response to these
[80].
Flavonoids are produced from phenylalanine which is
synthesised through the shikimate pathway (Figures 13
and 14). In leaves of the glu1-2 mutant the phenylalanine metabolism was identified as being negatively
affected whereas flavonoid biosynthesis was identified as

being positively affected on the transcriptional level
(Additional file 2). This could be interpreted as reduced
levels of phenylalanine and increased amount of flavonoids and related compounds in glu1-2 mutant leaves,
although tobacco plants with reduced Fd-GOGAT activity accumulate phenylalanine and tyrosine [11].
Although the expression levels of a fair number of
genes implicated in the shikimate pathway were affected

Figure 14 Changes in gene expression in flavonoid biosynthesis of the glu1-2 mutant. Simplified schematic representation of the
flavonoid biosynthetic pathway and the genes showing different expression levels in glu1-2 leaves and root. Gene IDs indicated in blue are
upregulated whereas those indicated in red are downregulated. Enzymes: (1) phenylalanineammonia lyase (PAL), (2) cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, (3)
4-coumarate-CoA ligase, (4) chalcone synthase, (5) chalcone isomerase, (6) flavanone 3-hydroxylase, (7) flavonoid 3’-hydroxylase, (8) flavonol
synthase, (9) flavonol glycosyltransferase. The figure is based on [80]. The detailed data of the genes depicted in this figure are presented in
Additional file 8.

in glu1-2 leaves (Figure 13), a more detailed analysis
shows that most genes are only moderately affected. In
addition, no clear trend towards up- or downregulation
of the pathway is visible (Additional file 8). Indeed, on
one hand the genes encoding 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase DAHPS that have been
identified as important targets for regulation of the shikimate pathway are not affected in the glu1-2 mutant.
On the other hand, the genes encoding 3-

dehydroquinate synthase (DQS) and 3-dehydroquinate
dehydratase (DHQD) are slightly induced in glu1-2
leaves but do not constitute important regulatory steps
[80]. One of two putative prephenate aminotransferaseencoding genes (At2g38400) is downregulated in glu1-2
leaves. Prephenate aminotransferase transfers the amino
group from glutamate or aspartate for the synthesis of
arogenate. Genes putatively encoding arogenate dehydratase that catalyses the last step of the shikimate path-

Kissen et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:190
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/190

way leading to the formation of phenylalanine, were
either induced, repressed or unaffected in glu1-2 leaves
(Figure 13). This complex behaviour of the shikimate
pathway in response to various treatments and its regulation by feedback mechanisms has been described [80].
As to the flavonoid pathway as such (Figure 14), it
may be worth pointing out that although three (PAL2 to
4) of the four genes encoding phenylalanine ammonia
lyases that putatively catalyse the first step of the phenylpropanoid pathway [80] are slightly downregulated in
glu1-2 leaves, PAL1, whose effect on flavonoid accumulation has been shown, was not affected. Among the
various affected genes was the gene At5g13930 encoding
chalcone synthase, the first committed enzyme in flavonoid synthesis, which was upregulated in leaves and
roots of the glu1-2 mutant. CHS expression has been
shown to be induced by sugar, high light, UV and blue
light, and phoshorus and nitrogen depletion [80]. Two
genes encoding UGTs that catalyse in vitro the transfer
of glucose from UDP-glucose to the 7-OH position of
flavonols were among the twenty most highly upregulated ones in glu1-2 leaves: UGT73B1 [81] and
UGT73C6 [82]. UGTs that are involved in flavonoid
biosynthesis are essential for the accumulation of flavonoids [80]. It should however be noted that the
UGT73C6 is recognised by a probe that also recognises
UGT73C5 and the increased signal could therefore also
be due to an increased expression of the latter.
UGT73C5 is responsible for glycosylating brassinosteroids [83].
In glu1-2 roots, PathExpress identifies flavonoid biosynthesis in both down- and upregulated genes, whereas
it was revealed by GeneBins only among downregulated
genes (Additional files 3 and 4). This downregulation of
genes in roots is however hard to sustain by looking at
the reduced number of affected genes whose role in this
pathway has been confirmed. As to the regulators of the
flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, PAP1/MYB75 is the
only implicated transcription factor that is affected in
glu1-2 roots, where it is slightly upregulated (Additional
file 8). PAP1/MYB75 is a positive regulator of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway and is strongly induced by
nitrogen deficiency [80]. However the genes encoding
PAP2 and MYB12, two other transcription factors of
this pathway that are also induced by nitrogen deficiency [80], are not affected in the glu1-2 mutant.
The multidrug resistance-related protein (MRP)-type
ABC transporters have been implicated in the vacuolar
sequestration of phenolic compounds such as flavonoids
and anthocyanins, and flavonoids have been suggested
as negative regulators of MDR-type members (for
review: [84]). A long distance transport of flavonoids by

Page 23 of 31

the MRP-type of ABC transporters was also recently
suggested, although the transporter and the mechanism
were not identified [85]. In total, 11 of the 15 AtMRPencoding genes are induced in glu1-2 leaves, whereas
only two are affected in glu1-2 roots (Additional file 9).
The AtMRP2 to AtMRP5 are ATP-dependent pumps
for organic ions [86] and, interestingly, AtMRP2 and
AtMRP3 are able to transport glutathione S-conjugates
and chlorophyll catabolites into vacuoles [87,88].
AtMRP4 [89] and AtMRP5 are supposedly involved in
regulating ion channel activities in guard cells but also
have transport activity: folate for AtMRP4 and E 217G
for AtMRP5. Folate mediates large metabolic fluxes
mainly during photorespiration as a cofactor of the
mitochondrial GDC/SHM (mentioned before) complex
[86]. The roles of the other MRP transporters affected
in glu1-2 leaves have not yet been described, although
the contribution of AtMRP12 in detoxification seems to
be marginal [88] and AtMRP15 may possibly constitute
a pseudogene [90]. Based on gene expression, Klein
et al. [86] speculate that AtMRP14 could be involved in
processes controlling seed integrity and germination efficiency such as the regulation of dormancy.
Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase-encoding genes are
affected in the glu1-2 mutant Another group of
enzymes related to stress response are cytochrome P450
monooxygenases. They are known to be involved in the
synthesis of structural components, hormones, signalling
molecules (e.g. SA and JA) and defense compounds (flavonoids, phytoalexins, glucosinolates). A large number
of cytochrome P450s are responsive to hormones, signaling molecules and environmental stresses (for review:
[91]). The functions of most of the 245 members of this
group of enzymes in A. thaliana have not yet been identified, and it is therefore impossible to attribute most of
these to particular pathways. Cytochrome P450s are
categorised into the gene ontology term GO:0006118
(electron transport), which was revealed as being overrepresented (together with its parent GO:0006091) by
GOstat analysis (Additional file 2).
In the glu1-2 mutant cytochrome P450 were especially
frequent among the most upregulated and downregulated genes in roots. In total 22 and 39 genes annotated
as encoding cytochrome P450 are affected in roots and
leaves respectively (Additional file 10), indicating that
proportionally a greater number of cytochrome P450s
were responsive in roots.
Of the 22 genes affected in roots, 9 are repressed and
13 are induced (Additional file 10). Five cytochrome
P450 encoding genes (CYP712A1, 76G1, 93D1, 716A2,
96A12 in descending order of induction) are among the
10% most highly induced genes and all but one are

Kissen et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:190
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/190

specifically affected in roots. On the other hand, the
genes encoding the cytochrome P450s CYP71A12,
CYP82C4 and CYP81F2 were among the 10% most
highly repressed genes in glu1-2 roots. The function of
CYP71A12and CYP82C4 has not yet been described. It
was however shown that CYP71A12 expression
responded in a similar way to aphid infestation than
CYP71B15, which is involved in synthesis of the defence
compound camalexin [92]. The role of CYP81F2 in the
synthesis of indole glucosinolates, another group of
compounds involved in plant defence, was recently
reported [93]. In the glu1-2 mutant these three genes
are repressed in roots while they are induced in leaves.
The genes encoding three cytochrome P450 (i.e.
CYP79B2, CYP79B3 and CYP83A1) involved in the biosynthesis of glucosinolates are on the other hand
induced in glu1-2 roots.
In glu1-2 leaves, 20 cytochrome P450s were induced
whereas 16 were repressed (Additional file 10). The two
cytochrome P450-encoding genes that show the highest
induction in glu1-2 leaves are At3g28740 (CYP81D11)
and At4g37370 (CYP81D8). These genes, together with
At3g14660 (CYP72A13), were among the 30 genes upregulated by cis-jasmone treatment [94]. CYP81D8 is also
among the eight genes induced early on by imidazolinone treatment, a herbicide inhibiting acetohydroxyacid
synthase (AHAS; EC 2.2.1.6) catalysing the first step of
valine, isoleucine and leucine synthesis (Figure 8; [95]).
Expression of CYP81D11 is induced by the application
of various chemicals, such as 2,4-D and SA, and bacterial infestation [96]. These and other cytochrome P450encoding genes upregulated in glu1-2 leaves are also
particularly responsive to abiotic stresses such as oxidative stress, osmotic stress, cold, heat and salt [97]. Analysis of genes co-expressed with CYP81D8 and
CYP81D11 [97] could also indicate a role in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Similarly, cytochrome P450 genes
showing the highest downregulation in leaves could be
associated with photosynthesis related processes, based
on co-expression analysis [97].
The detoxification of secondary metabolites and
xenobiotics is induced in glu1-2 Another indication
that glu1-2 mutants deploy a general stress response is
the change in expression of genes involved in the detoxification of secondary metabolites and xenobiotics.
Some of the cytochrome P450-encoding genes that are
affected in the glu1-2 mutant may play a role in the
phase I of this detoxification [98].
Glutathione S-transferases (EC 2.5.1.18; GSTs), also
known as glutathione transferases (GTs), are involved in
the second phase of detoxification processes. These
enzymes catalyse the conjunction of glutathione (GSHtripeptide) with electrophilic compounds, to form non
toxic derivatives that are ready to be compartimentalised

Page 24 of 31

in vacuoles. In addition, GSTs can serve as peroxidases,
isomerases and thiol transferases or have non-catalytic
functions such as ligand binding and modulation of signalling processes (for review: [99]). Several studies that
have analysed the responsiveness of AtGSTs to different
stimuli have revealed the complex nature of the regulation of these genes (for review: [100]). In glu1-2 leaves
the expression of 26 genes coding for (putative) GSTs
belonging to the tau (GSTU), phi (GSTF) and zeta
(GSTZ) classes are affected, 20 of these being induced
and 6 being repressed. In glu1-2 roots, four glutathione
S-transferases are induced and two are repressed (Additional file 11). Eight GSTU-encoding genes are among
the 5% most upregulated genes in glu1-2 leaves and
AtGSTU24 (At1g17170), the most highly induced of
them, was reported to be induced by herbicide treatment, xenobiotic exposure and in the catalase 2 deficient mutant (characterised by intracellular redox
perturbation and activation of oxidative signalling). It
was hypothesised that AtGSTU24 could be involved in
the conjugation of stress-induced catabolites ([101] and
references therein). AtGSTU24 has also been shown to
be SA inducible [102]. Several of the other highly upregulated GSTU-encoding genes, such as GSTU1, 2, 4, 7,
9, 19, 22, 25 are induced in response to salt stress [103].
As to members of the phi class that are induced in
glu1-2 leaves, AtGSTF6/GSTF7 (At1g02930/At1g02920
dual probe) are responsive to cold and heat stress, oxidative damage and metal exposure [104]. AtGSTF2 has
also been shown to be responsive to several stimuli and
the protein interacts with flavonoids in vitro [105].
UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) use UDP-activated
sugars as donor to catalyse the glycosylation of various
metabolites and are hence implicated in a series of
mechanisms and pathways, including phase II of the
detoxification mechanism.
In glu1-2 mutant leaves 45 UGT-encoding genes are
affected, which represents a third of the approximately
120 UGT-encoding genes that have been identified in the
A. thaliana genome (for review: [106]). Thirty-six are
induced in glu1-2 leaves and fourteen of these are among
the top 5% induced genes (Additional file 12). UGT73B1
and UGT73C6, already mentioned above, are involved in
flavonoid biosynthesis [81,82]. In vitro essays with
UGT73B4 (At2g15490) showed that it was able to glycosylate both the 3-OH and the 4-OH position of the
benzoate derivative 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid [107].
UGT75B1 (At1g05560) is associated with the callose
synthase complex [108] and is highly induced in oxidative
stress catalase 2 deficient mutants [101]. UGT84A3
(At4g15490) may be involved in sinapate ester metabolism in plants [109]. Three genes encoding UGTs that
may be involved in cytokinin glycosylation [110] were
also affected in glu1-2 leaves: UGT73C1 (At2g36750),

Kissen et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:190
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/190

UGT85A1 (At1g22400) and UGT76C1 (At5g05870).
Recombinant UGT73C1 is also able to conjugate transformation products of the explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene
[111]. UGT84B1 (also known as IAGLU) glucosylates
indole-3-acetic acid [112] and the encoding gene
At4g15550 is also upregulated in glu1-2 leaves. UGT74F2
(At2g34820) has been described as a salicylic acid glucosyltransferase [107,113] and it has also been hypothesised
as playing a role in tryptophan biosynthesis [114].
Several of the UGT-encoding genes that are highly
upregulated in glu1-2 leaves have been shown to be
stress responsive. Recently, UGT74E2 (At1g05680) was
identified as one of eight genes that were rapidly and
highly induced upon treatment with the herbicide imidazolinone [95]. This gene was the most highly induced
in glu1-2 leaves. UGT73B1, UGT73B2 and UGT73B3
have been implicated in the response to oxidative stress
and a role in stress response and resistance to Pseudomonas syringae was shown for UGT73B3 and UGT73B5
[115,116].
Phase III of xenobiotic detoxification in plants consists
of storage of the compounds produced by the mechanisms of two first phases. The multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) efflux carriers may function in
this process, although the transport activities and exact
roles of most of these have not yet been described [117].
Fourteen of the 58 MATE protein-encoding gene of A.
thaliana are induced and five are repressed in glu1-2
leaves (Additional file 13). Three are among the top
fourteen induced genes in glu1-2 leaves: AtDTX1
(At2g04040), AtDTX3 (At2g04050) and AtDTX4
(At2g04070). AtDTX1 serves as an efflux carrier for
plant derived alkaloids [118]. To our knowledge, the
functions of AtDTX3 and AtDTX4 have not yet been
reported but AtDTX4 was also among the genes that
were rapidly induced by the herbicide imidazolinone
[95].
Numerous other responsive genes linked to a number
of different stresses/stimuli are induced in glu1-2
leaves Besides the stress responsive genes and those
involved in detoxification mechanisms that were discussed in more detail above, numerous other stressrelated genes were affected in the glu1-2 mutant. It is
beyond the scope of the present article to describe these
in detail. This can however be exemplified by the striking overlap between the genes induced in leaves of the
glu1-2 mutant and those described by Vanderauwera
et al. [119] in the catalase 2 deficient CAT2HP1 plant.
Of the 55 genes induced more than 3 fold in the
CAT2HP1 plant, 45 were also induced in glu1-2 mutant
leaves (Additional file 14), including cytochrome P450-,
GST- and UGT-encoding genes already mentioned

Page 25 of 31

above. Other similarities in transcriptional responses can
be detected between glu1-2 mutant plants and plants
submitted to cold treatment [73], heat stress [120] and
herbicide treatment [95](data not shown). This also
exemplifies that the transcriptional response of the glu12 mutant bears the signatures of a multiple stress
response.

Conclusions
Knocking down the expression of the gene Fd-GOGAT1
coding for one of the two ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthases, which catalyse the ultimate step in the
biosynthesis of glutamate, and a key enzyme in the
assimilation of inorganic nitrogen, has marked effects on
the transcriptome of the plant as evidenced by our
microarray analysis of the glu1-2 mutant. Even more so
as the assayed plants were grown in vitro on 1x MS
media supplemented with 3% sucrose, and nitrogen supply should not be limiting either under these conditions.
Hence, the transcriptional profiling should be viewed
under the angle that the growth conditions that were
used in the present study do not constitute the most
severe conditions possible for the glu1-2 mutant. This is
also indicated by the fact that the glu1-2 mutant
described here develops more slowly than wild-type
plants when grown on soil, but does eventually complete
its life cycle (data not shown). The Fd-GOGAT1 deficient A. thaliana mutants described previously display a
lethal phenotype [5,7,9]. It should however be noted
that the growth conditions for the glu1-2 mutant used
here, did not prevent plants from showing a chlorotic
phenotype, although less severe than in previously published studies.
As Fd-GOGAT1 expression is much higher in leaves
than in roots of A. thaliana at the steady state ([5];
Additional file 1), the effects were expectedly of a larger
scale in the leaves than in the roots, both in regard to
the number of affected genes and the levels of regulation. The level of downregulation of Fd-GOGAT1 itself
in the glu1-2 mutant is also much more pronounced in
leaves than in roots.
Although an effect can be seen on the expression
levels of genes involved in primary nitrogen assimilation,
glutamate metabolism and related pathways, the number
of such genes affected and the scale of changes are
more moderate than we expected. This may be
explained by the fact that the defect in primary nitrogen
assimilation exhibited by Fd-GOGAT mutants are specific to conditions when photorespiration is suppressed
[5], which is not the case under the experimental conditions chosen here. Upregulation of Fd-GOGAT 2 and
NADH-GOGAT may also compensate to some extent

Kissen et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:190
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/190

Page 26 of 31

for the loss of Fd-GOGAT1. Metabolic profiling confirmed the expected increase in glutamine levels in the
glu1-2 mutant but revealed also changes in the levels of
other amino acids.
Photosynthesis and related pathways are overall downregulated, which is consistent with the chlorotic phenotype of the glu1-2 mutant and the reduced amount of
total chlorophyll measured in gls mutants [5]. The flavonoid biosynthesis was also revealed as being affected,
although a more detailed analysis of the affected genes
did not reveal major changes in expression levels, except
for genes involved in the production of flavonoid
glycosides.
The most pronounced effect at the transcriptomic
level could however be seen on genes that are responsive to abiotic stresses and stimuli. Genes that had been
described before as being responsive to cold, heat and
drought could be identified as being upregulated in the
glu1-2 mutant, mostly in leaves. Especially striking is the
way that oxidative stress response genes and genes
involved in detoxification of secondary metabolites are
affected in the glu1-2 mutant.
Fd-GOGAT plays an important role in the photorespiratory cycle by participating in the reassimilation of
released ammonia. Deregulation of photorespiration in
the glu1-2 mutant may lead to a reduced elimination of
excess excitation energy, and hence an imbalance in the
redox status. In addition NH4+ that accumulates due to
the lack of reassimilation through the GS/GOGAT cycle
may be perceived by the plant as a toxic compound,
triggering a global stress response.

For microarray experiments of wild-type and glu1-2
mutant plants, four biological replicates of each were
processed simultaneously through the following procedure. Leaves and roots of 18 day old in vitro grown
plantlets were harvested separately and immediately
flash-frozen in liquid N2. Harvesting of tissue was performed two hours after onset of the 16 hour light period.
The harvested tissue was stored at -80°C until further
processing. Total RNA was extracted from plant tissue
(300 mg roots, 500 mg leaves) using the RNeasy Plant
Midi kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the supplier’s instructions. RNasin (Promega, Madison, USA) was
added to the RNA to the final concentration of 1 U/μl.
RNA quality was assessed by standard denaturing agarose
gel electrophoresis and RNA concentration was measured with a NanoDrop ND-1000 (Nanodrop, Delaware,
USA). To prepare the samples for microarray experiments the “GeneChip Expression Analysis” procedure of
Affymetrix (Santa Clara, USA) was followed. Briefly, 10
μg total RNA was processed through a one-cycle cDNA
synthesis procedure, the resulting double-stranded cDNA
was cleaned up and submitted to the synthesis of biotinlabelled cRNA. This biotin-labelled cRNA was then
cleaned up, quantified and fragmented before being
hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1
genome arrays. After 16 hours of hybridization the arrays
were processed through the washing and staining procedures, before being scanned and analysed. Microarray
data files have been deposited in the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO accession number: GSE20493).

Methods

Statistical analysis of microarray data

Plant material

The microarray data were preprocessed using the
Robust Multichip Average (RMA) package [123] as
implemented in R [124]. The data were normalized
using quantile normalization, and expression measures
were produced by fitting the RMA robust linear model.
Differentially regulated genes were identified using moderated t-tests discussed in [125] and implemented in the
Limma package for R. To adjust for the large number of
hypothesis tests made, the q-value [126] associated with
each p-value was also calculated. The q-value for a gene
is the expected proportion of false positives one will get
when calling that gene significant. For a gene to be considered significantly differentially expressed in this
experiment its q-value was required to be lower than
0.01. In effect, this means controlling the false discovery
rate (FDR) [127] in the experiment at a 0.01 level.

The A. thaliana T-DNA insertion line SALK_019917 for
Fd-GOGAT1 (At5g04140) was identified in the SALK TDNA insertion mutant collection [121], seeds were
obtained from the European Arabidopsis Stock Centre
NASC [122] and homozygous mutant plants (called
glu1-2) were obtained. The T-DNA insertion was
checked by PCR amplification using a T-DNA primer
and a Fd-GOGAT1 specific primer, and subsequent
sequencing of the amplicon. A. thaliana ecotype Col-0
was used as wild-type control in all described assays.
Plant growth conditions

Wild-type Col-0 and mutant glu1-2 seeds were surface
sterilised and sown on solid in vitro cultivation medium
consisting of 1x Murashige and Skoog basal salt mixture, 3% sucrose, 0.75% phytoagar (w/v), pH5.7. This
medium contains 1650 mg ammonium nitrate/L. Seeds
were stratified for 3 days at 4°C before being transferred
to a controlled growth chamber under a 16 hour photoperiod (light intensity: 75 μmol.m-2.sec-1) at 21-23°C.

Microarray analysis

Genome annotation

Genome annotation as given in the tables originates
from Affymetrix (Santa Clara, USA). This was supplemented/updated by information provided by The

Arabidopsis Information Service (TAIR; [128]) and the
Salk Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory (SIGnAL;
[121]).
Biochemical pathways were assessed according to published data (see referred articles at the respective places
in the text) and information provided by the AraCyc
database [129], the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG; [130]) and the Expert Protein Analysis System (ExPASy; [131]).
Classification into GO terms were taken over from the
software in question (e.g. GOstat, MapMan) but
AmiGO [132] and the GO annotation at TAIR [128]
were used for more extensive searches.

NMR spectroscopy of total metabolites and principal
component analysis (PCA)

Total metabolites were extracted from freeze-dried plant
material according to Liang et al. [133] with some modifications. Fresh plant material (0.5 g) was freeze-dried
and extracted with 1.5 ml mixture of KH2PO4 buffer (90
mM, pH 6.0) in D2O containing 0.05% TSP (trimethylsilyl propionic acid sodium salt, w/v) and methanol-d 4
(1:1). The extract was vortexed for 30s, centrifuged at
4500 rpm for 10 min and filtered through glass wool.
Five hundred microliters of the supernatant were taken
for NMR spectroscopy analysis.
NMR spectroscopy was performed at 25°C on a Bruker DRX 600 spectrometer (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany) resonating at 600.13 MHz fitted with a 5 mm
BBO probe. The frequency lock was done on MeOD.
1D 1H-NMR spectra were recorded with presaturation
of the residual water resonance in the interscan delay
using a standard Bruker pulse sequence (zgpr). A 90°
excitation pulse was used to record 256 FID’s with a
spectral width of 8389 Hz averaged into 32 k data
points with an acquisition time of 3.91 s. The interscan delay was 3 s. 1 H, 1 H-COSY NMR spectra with
the same spectral width as the 1D spectra were
recorded with 2048x512 data points in the F2xF1
directions. Presaturation of the residual water resonance was done in the interscan delay using a standard
Bruker pulse sequence (cosyqfpr). 16 FID’s were
recorded for each increment in the F1 direction. A
square sine bell window function was applied in both
directions and zero filling in the F1 direction was
applied to give the processed spectrum a resolution of
2048x2048 data points.
The NMR spectra were exported from TOPSPIN and
imported into R [124] where the datasets were compiled.
SpecAlign [134] was used for peak alignment of the spectra. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed
in R using the pls library of Mevik et al[135]. The loading
plots from the analyses were used to identify the resonances that were different between the groups.
