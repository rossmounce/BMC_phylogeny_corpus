Abstract
Background: The pharmacological action of specific immunosuppressants is mediated by
immunophilins. While cyclosporin A binds to cyclophilins, FK506/tacrolimus, rapamycin, and others
bind to FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs). Different physiological actions of immunophilins were
described but their genuine function, however, remains elusive and is still under investigation. A
yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using the FK506 binding protein 13 kDa (FKBP13) as a bait
and a fetal liver expression library as a prey.
Results: The C-chain of complement C1q (C1q-C) was detected to interact with FKBP13 in the
yeast two-hybrid system and in a protein complementation assay. Neither FKBP12, FKBP25,
FKBP52 nor the unrelated immunophilin CypA did react with C1q-C in the yeast system stressing
the specificity of the interaction. Binding of C1q-C to FKBP13 could not be prevented in the
presence of FK506, demonstrating that possibly other regions than the binding pocket of the drug
are responsible for the interaction of the two proteins.
Conclusion: It is concluded that exclusively FKBP13 but no other FKBPs tested so far interact
with the C-chain of complement C1q in the two different assays and further work will be initiated
to investigate the physiological relevance of the interaction.

Background
The pharmacological action of cyclosporin A and FK506/
tacrolimus is mediated by cytosolic immunophilins
namely cyclophilin A and the FK506 binding protein 12
kDa (FKBP12). The drug immunophilin complex binds to
and inhibits the protein phosphatase calcineurin thus preventing signal transduction in activated T cells [1]. FKBPs
are a family of proteins that were found from procaryotes
to humans. At least 10 human FKBPs are known and can
be found in every tissue so far analyzed. Some FKBPs bind
to and "stabilize" intracellular receptors. For example,
FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 interact with the ryanodine Ca2+

channels RyR1 and RyR2, respectively [2,3]. FKBP52 is
part of the steroid receptor complex [4]. Another FKBP,
FKBP13, is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum.
FKBP13 mRNA is up-regulated in the presence of
unfolded proteins, e.g. after tunicamycin treatment and
heat shock and it is regarded to act as a chaperone [5]. On
the other hand FKBP13 was shown to interact specifically
with single proteins like a homologue of the erythrocyte
membrane cytoskeletal protein 4.1 and a FKBP associated
protein 48 kDa [6,7]. Finally, FKBP25 was described to be
a nuclear protein and the transcription factor YY1 or

histone deacetylases (HDAC1 and HDAC2) specifically
interact with this FKBP family member [8,9].
The phylogenetically ancient complement system composed of more than 30 proteins is part of the immunogenic system including a cascade of interacting proteins
called C1 to C9. Activation finally leads to lysis of marked
cells. C1, the first protein in this cascade, is composed of
one C1q and two C1r and C1s proteins. While C1q binds
the Fc regions of two IgGs or one IgM molecule, C1r and
C1s are known to activate other components of the pathway, namely C4 and C2.
C1q contains 18 polypeptide chains (six A-, six B-, and six
C-chains) and is composed of six globular heads linked
via six collagen like stalks to a fibril-like central region
[10]. Each of the globular heads is formed by association
of the C-terminal region of an A-, B-, and C-chain.
In addition C1q seems to play an important role as an
immunmodulator in its own and has pathophysiological
impact. C1q deficient individuals develop a systemic
lupus erythematodes (SLE)-like disease [11] and C1q deficient mice show elevated auto-antibody titres and develop
glomerulonephritis and renal damage probably because
of accumulation of apoptotic bodies [12]. As C1q can
bind to a variety of pathologically relevant targets in an
antibody-independent manner it might directly activate
cellular functions. Indeed, several receptors for C1q have
been described. C1qRp is a putative receptor for phagocytosis enhancement by monocytes [13]. The rodent homologue of C1qRp is tightly regulated during development
[14]. C1q was shown to bind to cell lines expressing the
complement receptor 1 (CR1) in a saturable manner [15].
A receptor for the collagenous domains of C1q has been
purified and was shown to be idenical to calreticulin [16].
Finally, a binding protein for the globular head of C1q
(gC1qbp) was isolated [17].
In this work interaction of the C-chain of complement
C1q (C1q-C) with a member of the FK506 binding protein (FKBP) family was detected and the specificity of the
interaction was further investigated.

Results
Yeast two-hybrid screen
The physiological function of immunophilins in endocrine systems is rarely characterized. A commercially available fetal human liver cDNA expression library was used
to identify proteins that interact with the immunophilin
FKBP13 which is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum.
Plasmids encoding FKBP13 without signal peptide fused
to the LexA-DBD (pBTM-FKBP13w/oS) and the liver
cDNA library were sequentially transformed into yeast
L40. Ten million yeast double transformants (correspond-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2210/4/19

ing to 3.5 × 106 independent clones) were screened and
selected for histidine prototrophy. Among 216 colonies
isolated as His+, 21 were found to display beta-galactosidase (β-gal) activity. Plasmids were isolated from each of
these clones and were used for retransformation of yeast
L40 pretransformed with pBTM-FKBP13w/oS. Six clones
remained positive (clone A3, B10, B31, B55, C8, C30) and
turned out to code for five different cDNAs after sequence
analysis. One of the clones (A3) representing the cDNA of
the C-chain of complement C1 corresponding to amino
acids 122 to 217 was selected for the present study. The
interaction of a second clone with FKBPs was described
elsewhere [18].
Interaction of full length C-chain of C1q with FKBP13 and
with other FKBPs
FKBPs share a common binding motif for the immunosuppressant FK506. To check the specificity of the
FKBP13/C1q-C interaction, yeast L40 was cotransformed
with a plasmid coding for the full length C1q-C-Gal4AD
hybrid protein lacking a 26 amino acids signal peptide
(pGAD-C1q-Cw/oS) and different plasmids each of them
coding for FKBP12, FKBP13w/oS, FKBP25, and FKBP52
fused in frame to the DBD of LexA (pBTM-FKBP12, 13w/
oS, 25, and 52). Cotransformants were checked for histidine prototrophy and β-gal activity. Only FKBP13 interacted with the C1q-Cw/oS protein in the yeast two-hybrid
system whereas FKBP12, 25, and 52 failed in this respect.
Interaction of C1q-C with cyclophilin A
Cyclophilins are the second family of immunophilins. To
check for cross reactivity, binding of C1q-Cw/oS to the
prototype of cyclophilins, cyclophilin A (CypA), was
investigated in the same system. Yeast L40 was cotransformed with a plasmid expressing LexA-CypA hybrids
(pBTM-CypA) and pGAD-C1q-Cw/oS and was tested for
β-gal activity and histidine prototrophy. C1q-Cw/oS and
CypA failed to interact in the yeast two-hybrid system.
Interaction of C1q-C with FKBP13 in a protein
complementation assay
In order to verify the results obtained with the yeast twohybrid screen, the GST pull-down approach was used first.
As the expression of C1q-Cw/oS either in a coupled reticulocyte lysate system or in bacteria failed, the interaction
of C1q-Cw/oS with FKBP13w/oS was analyzed in a protein complementation assay. INS-1 cells were cotransformed with a plasmid coding for FKBP13w/oS fused in
frame via a 15 amino acid peptide linker to aa 198 to 287
of β-lactamase (pCDNA-FKBP13w/oS-Bla2) and a plasmid coding for β-lactamase aa 21 to 196 fused in frame
via a 15 amino acid peptide linker to C1q-Cw/oS (pCMVSPORT-Bla[1]M182TlinkCENP-A). As shown in Fig. 1,
cotransformation of the hybrid-proteins resulted in β-

cotransfected with pCDNA3.1Zeo+/F [I]M182T-15-Zip and
pCDNA3.1Zeo+/Zip-15-F[2] (Zip+Zip), or were cotransfected with pCMVSPORT-Bla[1]M182TlinkC1q-Cw/oS and
with pCDNA-FKBP13linkBla[2] (13+C1q-C). As a negative
control cells were transfected with pCDNAFKBP13linkBla[2] (sham). After lysis of the cells, β-lactamase
activity was measured by hydrolysis rates of nitrocefin. The
insert resembles the time dependent effect. The absorbances

lactamase activity; the interaction of C1q-Cw/oS with
FKBP13w/oS was confirmed by using this second assay.
Interaction of C1q-C with FKBP13 in the presence of
FK506
The crystal structure of FK506/FKBP complexes predicts
that the recognition site in the endogenous ligand(s)
equivalent to FK506 would best be emulated by a Iso-Pro
or Leu-Pro motif [19]. FK506 might mimic the binding
motif of C1q-C to FKBP13. For this reason, the influence
of the drug on the interaction of C1q-Cw/oS with
FKBP13w/oS was investigated in the yeast two-hybrid system. Cotransformants of yeast L40 with pGAD-C1q-Cw/
oS and pBTM-FKBP13w/oS were incubated in the presence or absence of FK506. Cells were collected and measured for β-gal activity. As shown in figure 2, FK506 does
not decrease the interaction of C1q-C with FKBP13, but
rather seems to increase the affinity of C1q-C to the FKBP
at low micromolar concentrations. The interaction of
C1q-C with FKBP13 could not be suppressed, even in the
presence of 100 µM FK506.

analyzed as described in material and methods. Shown are
the results of 4–8 independent experiments ± S.E.M.. The

Discussion
The C-chain of complement C1q interacts with FKBP13
A yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out using the FK506
binding protein 13 kDa (FKBP13) as a bait and a human
liver expression library as a prey. The screen revealed the
C-chain of complement C1q (C1q-C) to interact with
FKBP13. Three other FKBPs, namely FKBP12, FKBP25 and
FKBP52 failed to interfere with C1q-C under same conditions indicating specificity for the positive result in the
yeast system. The interaction of C1q-C with FKBP13 was
proved by using additionally a protein complementation
assay (PCA), demonstrating that the interaction of C1q-C
with the FKBP13 was not an artifact in the yeast twohybrid system. The interaction of C1q-C with FKBP13 in
the PCA seems to be comparable to the interaction of the
two GCN4 leucine zippers (Zip) which were used as a positive control. The intensity of the interaction might
depend on the efficiency of the cell transfection, cell density, cell growth, and other factors but hydrolysis rates of
nitrocefin as a marker of the interaction are clearly different from the negative control which can be best seen after
270 min of incubation (Fig. 1, insert). The verification of
the interaction in a classical GST pull-down assay was
used elsewhere [18] but failed in this work as the rather
small C1q-C protein could not be produced and labelled
in vitro (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation of the
interacting proteins was not planned since a C1q-C

antibody is not available. The interaction, therefore, of
C1q-C with different FKBPs was demonstrated in two
independent approaches albeit the presence of an additional cellular factor necessary for the interaction can not
be excluded with these cellular assays.
The C-chain of complement C1q does not interact with
cyclophilin A
Immunophilins belong to the class of peptidyl prolyl isomerases (E.C. 5.2.1.8). They can be divided into FKBPs
that bind for example FK506/tacrolimus or rapamycin
and cyclophilins that mediate the pharmacological action
of cyclosporin A (CsA). Cyclophilin A (CypA) can be
regarded as the prototype of the cyclophilins. Unlike the
aforementioned FKBP13, the immunophilin CypA does
not interfere with C1q-C in the yeast two-hybrid system
underlining the specificity of the interaction of C1q-C
with FKBP13.
FK506 fails to negatively influence the FKBP13 C1q-C
interaction
The immunosuppressive drug FK506 is not able to
decrease the affinity of C1q-C to FKBP13 in the yeast twohybrid system even when used in a concentration of 100
micromolar. The common binding motif of FKBPs for
FK506 is, therefore, less likely to be uniquely involved in
the C1q-C FKBP13 interaction. On the other hand, at low
micromolar concentrations FK506 seems to „strengthen"
the interaction of C1q-C with FKBP13. Possibly, C1q-C,
when produced artificially in yeast, binds to yeast FKBP as
well and has to be liberated from these interfering positions by FK506, then contributing to the interaction with
the FKBP13-AD hybrid protein. An excess of FK506
should further diminish the C1q-C FKBP13 interaction
but the drug cannot be tested in the milimolar range
because of its toxicity. The influence of FK506 on the
interaction of the two proteins was not investigated in a
mammalian cell line because the influence in the yeast
system is more likely comparable to other investigations
[e.g. [7,18]]. Additionally the immunosuppressive agent
is expected to be far toxic in the micromolar range when
used in a mammalian cell system. Finally, a negative effect
of the immunosuppressive drug on the C1q-C FKBP13
complex could not be demonstrated albeit the involvement of the FK506 binding pocket in the interaction cannot be excluded.

Conclusions
Using two different experimental approaches, the C-chain
of complement C1q was shown to interact with FKBP13.
FKBP13, initially used as the bait for the yeast two-hybrid
screen in this work, is regarded as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein. It might act as a chaperone but specifically interacts with other proteins like a homologue of the
erythrocyte membrane cytoskleletal protein 4.1 or the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2210/4/19

FKBP associated protein 48 (FAP48), too. FKBP13 was
detected in membrane preparations from erythrocytes as
well, demonstrating that its expression and maintenance
is not restricted to the ER [6]. The C-chain of complement
C1q is part of the C1q molecule that is composed of six A, six B-, and six C-chains, respectively. Interaction of
FKBP13 with the A- or B-chain or with the entire C1q molecule has not been investigated yet. The carboxy-terminal
part of the C-chain is sufficient to interact with FKBP13 in
the yeast two-hybrid system. If the entire C1q molecule
interacts with FKBP13, interaction of its globular head
with the immunophilin will be likely therefore, as the
globular head is is formed by association of the C-terminal regions of an A-, B-, and C-chain. On the other hand,
FKBP13 might act as a specific chaperone, triggering C1qC in the endoplasmic reticulum and preventing the complement protein to interact with other intracellular proteins. Further work will be necessary to elucidate the
physiological significance of the interaction of the two
proteins and to investigate whether FKBP13 plays an
important role in the complement system, too.

Methods
Expression vectors
The cDNA encoding FKBP13 amino acids 16–142 was
amplified from pBluescript-FKBP13 (a gift from Dr. S.
Burakoff, Dana-Faber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) using
specific primers CGCCGGAATTCATGCTGAGCGCCGTG
and CGGCTGGATCCGAACAGTCTGGTC. The cDNA
encoding full-length FKBP25 was amplified from pBluescript-FKBP25 (a gift from Dr. S. Burakoff, Dana-Faber
Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) using the specific primers
CGCGCGAATTCAACA
GTCTGGTCCCTGATG
and
GGCGTAGGATCCGGGGTTGACTCCGGGGGC.
The
cDNA encoding full-length cDNA of CypA was amplified
from I.M.A.G.E clone 5264185 (ResGen, Huntsville, AL)
by using the specific primers GGTCCGGAATTC ATGGTCAACCCCACCGTGTTC
and
GGCAGCTGGATCCACAAGTCA AAC TTATTCGAG. After restriction digest,
cDNAs were fused to the DNA binding domain of LexA by
inserting the EcoRI/BamHI fragments into pBTM116 [20]
to give pBTM-FKBP13w/oS, pBTM-FKBP25, and pBTMCypA, respectively. pBTM-FKBP12 and pBTM-FKBP52 (a
gift from Dr. B. Chambraud, INSERM U488, Bicêtre,
France) are described elsewhere [7]. Full lenght cDNA of
human C1q-C lacking a 26 amino acids signal peptide
was amplified from I.M.A.G.E clone AL568589 (ResGen,
Huntsville, AL) using the specific primer CACGGAATTCAA GCCAACACAGGCTGCTAC and primer M13
reverse. After restriction digest the cDNA fragment was
fused in frame to the GAL4AD by inserting the EcoRI/NotI
fragment into pGAD1318 to give pGAD-C1q-Cw/oS. The
two vectors pCDNA3.1Zeo+/F [I]M182T-15-Zip and
pCDNA3.1Zeo+/Zip-15-F[2], a gift from Dr. S.W. Michnick, Montreal, were used as a positive control in the

protein complementation assay and are described elsewhere [21]. The cDNA encoding the TEM-1 β-lactamase
gene amino acids 21 to 196 (Bla[1]M182T) was amplified
from pGEM11Zf(+) using the primer pairs (i)
TTGGGCACCATGGACCCAGAAACG CTGGTGAAAG and
GTTAATAGTTTGCGCAACGTTGTTGCCATTGCTACA
GGCGACGAGGTGTC and (ii) GCGGCGAAGCTTCAATTGGGCACCATGGAC CCAGAAACG and ACCACCGGATCCGCCAGTTAATAGTTTGCGCAACG. Note that a
point mutation leading to M182T was inserted thatway
[22]. The cDNA encoding the TEM-1 β-lactamase gene
amino acids 198 to 287 and an amino-terminal 15 amino
acid linker (linkBla[2]) was amplified from pGEM11Zf(+)
sequentially using the primer pairs (i) GGTGGTGGTAGTCGAATTCTACTTACTCTAGCT TCCCGGC and
CCAGCTCTCGAGTTACCAATGCTTAATCAGTGAGGCACC (primerBla2XhoI) and (ii) CTGGCGGATCCGGTGGTGGTGGTAGTGGTGGTG
GTGGTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTAGTCGAATTCTAC
and
primer Bla2XhoI. After restriction digest cDNA of FKBP13
(from pBTMFKBP13w/oS) was fused into the EcoRI/
BamHI site of pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Groningen, The
Netherlands) and the linkBla[2] fragment was fused into
the BamHI/XhoI site of this plasmid to give pCDNAFKBP13linkBla[2]. After restriction digest Bla[1]M182T
and linkBla[2] fragments were sequentially fused into the
MunI/BamHI and BamHI/XhoI site of pCMVSPORT6
(Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) to give pCMVSPORT-Bla[1]M182TlinkBla[2]. After restriction digest
cDNA of C1q-C lacking the signal peptide (from pGADC1q-Cw/oS) was inserted into the EcoRI/XhoI site of
pCMVSPORT-Bla[1]M182TlinkBla[2] to give pCMVSPORT-Bla[1]M182TlinkC1q-Cw/oS. All inserts were
verified by sequencing.
Two-hybrid screen
The human fetal liver MATCHMAKER cDNA library
(Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was a gift from Dr. C. Sorg
(Institute of Experimental Dermatology, Münster, Germany). The yeast reporter strain L40, containing two
reporter genes, HIS3 and LacZ, was sequentially transformed with pBTM-FKBP13w/oS and the cDNA library
using the lithium acetate method [23]. Double transformants were plated on Minimal SD Base containing the -Leu/
-Trp/-His DO supplement (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The
plates were incubated at 30°C for 5 days. His+ colonies
were patched and assayed for β-gal activity. Positive
clones, inserted into the pACT2 vector, were rescued and
tested for specificity by retransformation into yeast L40
with pBTM-FKBP13w/oS. Different clones, that expressed
detectable β-gal activity within four hours, were used for
further analysis. All assays of β-gal activity and histidine
prototrophy were performed according to standard procedures [24].

Protein complementation assay
The protein complementation assay (PCA) was performed as described elsewhere [21]. Briefly, 1 × 106 INS-1
cells, an insulinoma cell line [25], were cotransformed
with 1 µg of the plasmids pCDNA-FKBP13linkBla[2] and
with 1 µg pCMVSPORT-Bla[1]M182TlinkCENP-A, or with
pCMVSPORT-Bla[1]M182TlinkBla[2] alone, or with the
positive control plasmids using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. After two
days, cells were washed with PBS and harvested into 100
µl of 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 and lysed by three
freeze-thaw cycles. After centrifugation at 13,000 g for 4
min, the supernatant was used to check for β-lactamase
activity. In a 96-well microtiter plate each well was loaded
with 80 µl of the phosphate buffer, 80 µl dejonized water,
20 µl of phosphate buffer containing 1 mM nitrocefin
(EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, freshly prepared from
a 10 mM stock solution in DMSO) and 20 µl of each
supernatant. The absorbance at 496 nm was measured
time-dependently in a platereader (Spectra Max 340,
Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Data after 90 min of
incubation were used to calculate the absorbance as percent of control.
