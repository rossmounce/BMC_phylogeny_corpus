Abstract
Background: Large scale genome arrangement, such as whole gene insertion/deletion, plays an
important role in bacterial genome evolution. Various methods have been employed to study the
dynamic process of gene insertions and deletions, such as parsimony methods and maximum
likelihood methods. Previous maximum likelihood studies have assumed that the rate of gene
insertions/deletions is constant over different genes. This assumption is unrealistic. For instance, it
has been shown that informational genes are less likely to be laterally transferred than noninformational genes. However, how much of the variation in gene transfer rates is due to the
difference between informational genes and non-informational genes is unclear. In this study, a Γdistribution was incorporated in the likelihood estimation by considering rate variation for gene
insertions/deletions between genes. This makes it possible to address whether a difference
between informational genes and non-informational genes is the main contributor to rate variation
of lateral gene transfers.
Results: The results show that models incorporating rate variation fit the data better than do
constant rate models in many phylogenetic groups. Even though informational genes are less likely
to be laterally transferred than non-informational genes, the degree of rate variation for insertions/
deletions did not change dramatically and remained high even when informational genes were
excluded from the study. This suggests that the variation in rate of insertions/deletions is not due
mainly to the simple difference between informational genes and non-informational genes. Among
genes that are not classified as informational and among the informational genes themselves, there
are still large differences in the rates that these genes are inserted and deleted.
Conclusion: While the difference in informational gene rates contributes to rate variation, it is
only a small fraction of the variation present; instead, a substantial amount of rate variation for
insertions/deletions remains among both informational genes and among non-informational genes.

Background
Gene insertions and deletions have been widely acknowledged to play an essential role in shaping bacterial
genomes during evolution [1-4]. Parsimony methods
have been employed to understand the process of gene

insertions and deletions [5-8]. However, parsimony
methods fail to distinguish parallel deletions and insertions on multiple branches [9-11]. The problem of parallel deletions and insertions can be overcome using

maximum likelihood methods by making use of transition probabilities [12].
Recently a maximum likelihood method was employed to
study gene insertions and deletions assuming constant
rates across genes in a given genome [13]. However, the
assumption of constant insertion/deletion rates among
genes is unrealistic. For example, it has been shown that
informational genes, such as those involved in transcription and translation, are less likely to be laterally transferred than are operational genes responsible for
metabolic processes [14,15]. This observation forms the
basis of the "complexity hypothesis". Unfortunately,
causes of rate variation for insertions/deletions beyond
the difference between informational genes and operational genes still remain unclear. A study of rate variation
for gene insertions/deletions making use of the maximum
likelihood method, therefore, becomes useful to address
questions on rate variation for gene insertions/deletions.
Here, a Γ-distribution has been incorporated into a maximum likelihood estimation of gene insertion/deletion
rates (Figure 1). After incorporating rate variation for gene
insertions/deletions among genes, the likelihood was
improved significantly over a constant rate model using
the same set of data from the Bacillus group as in [13]. The
method was applied to 173 complete bacterial genomes
in 25 phylogenetic groups; 20 groups showed significantly better fits to the data with rate variation for gene
insertions/deletions. The remaining five groups did not
show significantly better fits to the data with rate varia-

tion. Furthermore, the removal of informational genes
from the likelihood estimation contributes little change in
terms of the rate variation parameter α for gene insertions/deletions. This is the case despite informational
genes having significantly lower rates of insertions/deletions than non-informational genes.
The results reveal that rate variation of gene insertions/
deletions is much more complex than simply a difference
between informational genes and operational genes;
instead, a high degree of rate variation for insertions/deletions remains among both informational genes and
among non-informational genes.

Results
The same set of data from the Bacillus group in [13] was
used to initially test the performance of the models incorporating rate variation. Following the previous study,
three rate-conditions (μ1 = μ2 = μ3; μ1, μ2 = μ3; μ1, μ2, μ3;)
were assumed (see Figure 2), each one was further
extended by adding rate variation.
The likelihood of the models was improved significantly
by incorporating a Γ-distribution in rate variation models
compared with relevant constant rate models (χ2 = 2ΔLnL
&#x226B; 3.84 with d.f. = 1, see Table 1). Of the three
models, the likelihood of the single-constant rate model
was improved the most by incorporating rate variation. In
the single rate model with a Γ-distribution, the MLE (maximum likelihood estimation) rate of insertions/deletions
is 5.29, which is much greater than the rate 0.51 of the

Different insertion/deletion rates were assumed on the phylogeny.
Different insertion/deletion rates were assumed on the phylogeny. Case 1: a single constant rate throughout the phylogeny (μ1 = μ2 = μ3). Case 2: two rates differentiate the Bc group (μ1, μ2 = μ3). Case 3: three rates differentiate the Bc group
and the branch leading to this group (μ1, μ2, μ3).
constant rate model. There is a high degree of rate variation for gene insertions/deletions, since the rate variation
parameter α is 0.37; indicating that there is a small subset
of genes with rapid gene turn-over.
The two-rate and three-rate models both assumed different rates on certain parts of the phylogeny. After incorporating rate variation, they both showed significantly better
fits to the data than did the single rate model (Table 1),
but the MLE rates are similar to those estimated from the
constant rate models. In the two-rate model, the rates with
rate variation in a Γ-distribution are 4.73, 0.37 versus
4.42, 0.35 with constant rates. Similarly, in the three-rate
model, the rates with rate variation are 4.49, 0.32, 1.67

versus 3.92, 0.28, 1.23 with constant rates. Both models
consistently support that recently transferred genes tend
to have high rates of gene insertions/deletions as noted in
[13]. Both cases showed lower levels of rate variation
(greater α values) compared with the single-rate model
(5.83 and 3.04 versus 0.37 of α values), even though,
incorporating rate variation also improved the likelihood
significantly.
To gain a clearer picture of rate variation of lateral gene
transfer in the domain of bacteria, the study was expanded
to 173 complete bacterial genomes in 25 phylogenetic
groups (Tables 2 and 3). For each phylogenetic group, two
phylogenies were constructed. One (the select-genes tree)

is based on a group of selected genes, the other (the common-genes tree) is based on genes present among the relevant taxa as described in the Methods section. Of the 25
phylogenetic groups, 20 groups showed a fairly high level
of rate variation for gene insertions/deletions among
genes, and the confidence interval falls into a small range
for each α value (Table 4). It is also striking that estimates

using phylogenies on different set of genes or using different phylogenies are similar (Tables 2, 3, and 4). Five
groups did not show a significant level of rate variation for
gene insertions/deletions (α is ∞). The five groups are
Candidatus, Ehrlichia, Lactobacillus, Mycoplasma, and Synechococcus. The lower boundary of each infinite α value was
also estimated. The Ehrlichia group shows a very broad
interval range for the "maximum" likelihood value and
the lower boundary of α value is 0.39 (Table 4). The
undistinguished difference between the rate variation
model and the constant rate model in Ehrlichia might be
due to the limited size of data (gene families) and/or
accelerated evolution at the sequence level in this intracellular group. The relationship between the rate variation
parameter α in a Γ distribution and the average branch
length of each group was examined. Figure 3 shows that
there is a positive correlation between the rate variation
parameter α and the average branch length of each group.
Closely related groups tend to have a higher degree of rate
variation for gene insertions/deletions among genes,
while distantly related groups tend to have a lower level of
rate variation for gene insertions/deletions. This suggests
that the observation of rate variation is a strong local phenomenon and becomes blurry over evolutionary time.

MLE estimates of gene insertions/deletions rates in informational genes and in non-informational genes were estimated separately in the absence of rate variation. The rates
in informational genes are lower than those in non-informational genes in all groups, but none of them are zero
(Additional file 1). This is consistent with previous studies
that have shown informational genes have slower rates of
gene insertions/deletions than non-informational genes
[14,15], but they are not completely free of gene movement [16]. To evaluate whether the difference in informational genes contributes the most to rate variation of gene
transfers, maximum likelihood estimation with rate variation for gene insertions/deletions was conducted by
excluding all informational genes. The α values excluding
informational genes are remarkably similar to those
including informational genes (Figure 4), even though the
α values are slightly increased when excluding informational genes. However this could be because informational genes tend to be more conserved. We therefore,
excluded the same number of most conserved genes (e.g.
genes present in all taxa in each group). In this case, a
greater increase in α values was observed than that
observed when informational genes were excluded (Table
5). The ratio of the increase of α value after excluding

informational genes over the increase in α value after
excluding the same number of most conserved genes was
calculated (Table 5). If all informational genes are as
rarely transferred as are the most conserved genes, one
should expect that the ratio is close to 1. However, the
ratio in most groups (14 of 20 groups in each set of analysis) is smaller than 0.5, suggesting that the effect of
excluding informational genes is similar to that of excluding random genes rather than that of excluding the most
conserved genes. Rate variation for gene insertions/deletions in non-informational genes still remained high after
the genes that do not have significant matches to any
genes in COG classification were removed (Additional file
2). Furthermore, the level of rate variation in informational genes is significant in most groups (Additional file
3). Thus, rate variation for gene insertions/deletion is not
mainly due to the difference between informational genes
and non-informational genes, but instead, a substantial
amount of variation for gene insertions/deletions is
observed in both informational and non-informational
genes. In other words, the "complexity hypothesis" only
explains a small part of the variation in rate of gene insertions/deletions.

Discussion
The accuracy of maximum likelihood estimation of gene
indel rates is dependent on the presence of a robust phylogeny for the genomes under study. Phylogenies obtained
from single genes can sometimes be distorted due to rampant LGT [2,6,17,18] and rRNA sequences may not be
useful due to the lack of informative characters differentiating closely related species and varying functional constraints over the molecule [19,20]. We used a
concatenated DNA sequence obtained by joining the gene
sequences that are commonly present in many bacterial
genomes. For the select-genes tree construction, a set of
genes were chosen from those reported in previous studies
[21,22]. If there is more than one phylogeny generated for
a group, all phylogenies were used and weighted by their
occurrence to overcome the uncertainty of using just one.
To avoid the confounding effects of duplication during
evolution [23,24], duplicated genes were removed from
phylogeny construction. Due to the broad spectrum of
species analyzed in this study, there are few genes free of
both duplication and lateral gene transfer across all
groups. Consequently, the genes used for phylogeny
reconstruction may be different between groups (details
are given as supplementary information at [25]). To assess

the robustness of each select-genes tree, the commongenes trees were reconstructed using genes present in all
members of each phylogenetic group. When the common-genes tree and the select-genes tree are not topologically identical, a supertree was constructed. There are 12
groups that have an identical topology between the selectgenes tree and the common-genes tree. The remaining 13
groups do not show an identical topology between the
select-genes tree and the common-genes tree. Please note
that many differences are due to either the lack of phylogenetic signal at the tips of a phylogeny or the placement
of the root (see supplementary information [25] for more
details).
One way to achieve a more accurate phylogeny is to make
use of a large number of genes in comprehensive phylogenetic studies, such as supermatrics (concatenated genes)
and supertrees [26-30]. The more data included in a phylogenomic analysis, the more likely to overcome possible
stochastic errors [27,31]. In this study, the common-genes
tree was not always favored by the supertree over the
select-genes trees. Indeed, there are two groups that the
select-genes tree is supported by the supertree (Additional
file 4). Slow evolving genes are sometimes more informa-

difference was calculated from

a informational −a random
a conserved −a random

tive for phylogeny construction, since fast evolving genes
might cause problems such as long branch attraction
[28,32]. The tree length of each gene was computed from
each phylogeny and plotted in (Additional file 5). It is
clear that the selected genes for phylogeny construction
have relatively slow evolutionary rates compared with all
common genes. There are 4 groups whose supertree does
not support the select-genes tree or the common-genes
tree. The lack of congruence in these groups is likely due
to insufficient taxon sampling. [27]. More accurate trees
might be obtained as more complete genome sequences
become available. Importantly, the maximum likelihood
estimates based on the common-genes trees are remarkably similar with the estimates based on the select-genes
trees (Tables 2, 3, 4, 5 and Figures 3, 4). For the 4 groups
that do not have an identical topology between the selectgenes tree and the common-genes tree, the results
reported are based on the supertree topology (branch
lengths were estimated from the selected genes). The
results are again similar to those based on the select gene

tree and those based on the common-genes tree (data not
shown).
To further explore how much, if at all, different phylogenies might alter the results, maximum likelihood estimation based on possible alternative topologies was
investigated. One hundred bootstraps from the alignment
of the common genes were generated for each group. For
the select-genes, possible alternative topologies were
obtained from the MRBAYES output. If there are more
than 10 distinct topologies, the top 10 ones according to
their likelihood were chosen for further maximum likelihood estimation. The maximum likelihood estimates are
shown in Additional files 6 and 7. It is clear that the α values are similar among different phylogenies. The removal
of informational genes results in little change on the rate
variation parameter α, and this holds true for each phylogeny. Furthermore, the likelihood estimations in the
Bacillus group based on a phylogeny constructed from different genes (Tables 2 and 3) are similar with those based
on the phylogeny of the previous study (Tables 1). The

Page 8 of 15

slight difference is due to the removal of short sequences
in this study and differences in the phylogenies constructed from different sequences. The results do not,
therefore, seem to be an artifact of the genes included or
the phylogeny reconstruction. Informational genes are
known to be less likely to undergo lateral gene transfer
[14], which is also the core of the "complexity hypothesis"
[15,33]. In this study, informational genes were found to
have lower rates of gene insertions/deletions compared
with non-informational genes (Additional file 1). However, no group has an insertion/deletion rate equal to 0,
suggesting that informational genes are not completely
free of gene movement. In fact, several ribosomal protein
coding genes are deleted from Streptococcus mutans (Additional file 8). The rate variation parameter, α, change after
excluding informational genes is similar to the α change
after randomly removing genes rather than the α change
after excluding the most conserved genes (Additional file
9). Furthermore, different cutoffs used in identifying
informational genes only resulted in variation of the
number of informational genes but did not affect the
degree of rate variation for insertions/deletions in noninformational genes (Additional file 10). There is a great
deal of rate variation for gene insertions/deletions in noninformational genes and also there is a significant level of
rate variation in informational genes. In other words, the
different rates between informational genes and noninformational genes as shown in the "complexity hypothesis" can only explain a small part of rate variation for
gene insertions/deletions. Similarly, our simulation study
showed that the high level of rate variation can not be
explained solely by the fast turn-over rates of recently
transferred genes (Additional file 11).
It has been suggested that different cutoff thresholds for
identifying homologues might affect the identification of
some gene gains [34], but different thresholds result in little change on the number of gene families [35] and the
rates of gene insertions/deletions [36]. In this study,
results using different thresholds were similar (data not
shown). It is important to note that gene duplication was
not taken into consideration in this study, since our focus
was on insertions/deletions of gene families rather than
intraspecific gene family duplication. This avoids the difficulty of distinguishing some gene transfer from gene
duplication [4,11]. Recently, some studies have suggested
that duplicated genes or genes that have a high duplicability propensity might be more likely to be involved in lateral gene transfer [37,38]. Methods incorporating gene
duplication information are desirable for future studies.
For the 20 groups that showed a significant improvement
in likelihood by adding rate variation, there is a positive
association between the rate variation parameter α and
the average branch length. Higher degrees of rate variation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/235

for gene insertions/deletion are expected to be observed in
closely related groups. The seven closely related Bacillus
genomes in the Bc group were analyzed separately and, as
expected, a high degree of rate variation was observed
(data not shown). Similarly, the five groups that have an
infinite α value show fairly high levels of divergence
within the group in terms of the average branch length. An
acceleration of sequence evolution in the endosymbiont
genomes has been acknowledged [39]. The accelerated
rates of evolution might affect the branch lengths of the
phylogeny used in the analyses and might also affect the
identification of homologues within each phylogenetic
group. Four endosymbiont groups showed strong accelerated rates of evolution. They are Candidatus, Ehrichia, Mycoplasma, and Richettsia. Analyses after the removal of these
four groups also showed similar results (data not shown).
There are two possible explanations for the correlation
between the average branch length and the α value. First,
it is possible that the observed correlation is due to the
lack of power of maximum likelihood estimation in distantly related groups. Previously, it has been shown that
comparison among distantly related species tends to infer
lower rates of insertions/deletions [13]. On the other
hand, if maximum likelihood estimation in the study has
enough power in distantly related groups, the results
might suggest that rate variation for insertions/deletions
has a strong local effect and becomes weaker as evolution
in progress. This strong local effect might be, at least partially, due to a high variability in recently transferred
genes. It is known that many of recently transferred genes
are under faster rates of evolution and might be eliminated from the genome rapidly [8,13], and while some
transferred genes that play roles in long term adaptation
might become fixed [40-43] and integrated into the functional network [44,45]. Maximum likelihood estimations
from simulated data showed support for these explanations. When the number of insertions/deletions
increased, a larger proportion of insertions/deletions
became undetectable, at the same time, sister taxa shared
less common genes and have more unique genes (Additional file 11). If this correlation holds true, after a long
enough time period, one should expect rate variation
becomes undetectable. Hence, over a long time period,
genes would have roughly the same chance to be transferred. This has been shown in some recent studies. By
examining the Cyanobacteria group, Zhaxybayeva et al.
reported that genes from all functional categories are subject to gene transfer [46]. In addition, it was suggested that
among all sequenced gene families, at least two-thirds and
probably all, have been affected by LGT at some time in
their evolutionary past [35].
On the other hand, not many genes in a genome are
shown to be affected by lateral gene transfer when com-

paring closely related species; This might be partially able
to explain the contradictory views of lateral gene transfer
at different phylogenetic scales. It has been reported that
the genes from closely related species tend to have clearer
tree-like relationship than the ones from distantly related
species [47,48] and the studies analyzing genomes in different degrees of divergence do not show congruent
results [18,49]. There may be several sources of noise in
the data in Figure 3. It is plausible that different phylogenetic groups might have slightly different mechanisms of
preventing lateral gene transfer or selectively retaining certain foreign genes. In fact, it is known that bacteria are
able to selectively retain foreign genes with certain
sequence features, such as codon usage [50] and GC content [51,52]. The possibility of lateral gene transfers into a
genome could also be affected by other internal or external environmental factors, such as genome size, carbon
utilization, isolated niches, and biochemical properties
[53-55]. However, there is no evidence found in this study
that the degree of rate variation for gene insertions/deletions across genes is associated with genome size (data not
shown).

Conclusion
Maximum likelihood models incorporating rate variation
allow us to evaluate the contribution to rate variation of
gene insertions/deletions between informational genes
and non-informational genes. Consistent with the "complexity hypothesis", informational genes are less likely to
be laterally transferred than non-informational genes.
However, the difference between informational genes and
non-informational genes is only a small fraction of the
variation present; instead, a substantial amount of rate
variation for insertions/deletions remains among both
informational genes and among non-informational
genes. Furthermore, the observation of rate variation has
a strong local effect and becomes blurry over evolutionary
time.

Methods
A maximum likelihood model was used as described in
[13]. In brief, gene presence or gene absence was treated
as a binary character (0,1) state (Figure 1). Given the evolutionary history, the probability of gene movement can
be computed from insertion and deletion rates. Like the
maximum likelihood estimation of a phylogeny using
DNA sequence, the likelihood of a character state at any
node on a given phylogeny can be calculated from the
character states in the immediate descendant nodes. The
likelihood of the gene phyletic pattern i (gene family i) at
the last common ancestral node is Li. In the maximum
likelihood estimation, the rates were optimized to find
those rates that maximized the likelihood of all gene patterns. Rate variation for gene insertions/deletions among
genes was taken into account in the model in a similar

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/235

manner as nucleotide rate heterogeneity in phylogeny
reconstruction [56,57]. A discrete Γ model with nine rate
categories (M = 9 categories) was implemented in the
maximum likelihood estimation. Thus if the likelihood
on gene family i with rate μ is Li(μ), and the density function of the distribution of rates is f(μ), the likelihood on
site i will be

Since the genes absent in all of the taxa are unobservable,
the results must be corrected for missing data. Hao and
Golding (2006) used the correction for missing data as
was used for missing restriction sites in [58], and the
results are then made conditional on observing the gene
present in at least one species. This is

Here L- is the likelihood of a gene being absent in all taxa
while L+ is the likelihood of the gene present in at least

Here N is the total number of gene families. To estimate
the maximum likelihood, the ins/del rates together with
the rate variation parameter α in a Γ distribution were
optimized to find those rates/values that maximized the
likelihood of observing the gene patterns.
The same set of data from the Bacillus group in [13] were
used to test the performance of the likelihood model with
rate variation. As was done in the previous study, three
models were examined (Figure 2) in an attempt to capture
some of the major differences among the genomes. In
brief, the rate on the branches of the Bc group (including
Ba, Bc, and Bt) is μ1, the rate on the branch leading to the
Bc group is distinguished as μ2, the rate on the remaining
branches is μ3. Three models were examined; one with all
branches evolving at the same rate (μ1 = μ2 = μ3), one with
Page 11 of 15

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:235

just the Bc group evolving at a separate rate (μ1, μ2 = μ3)
and one with each of the three groups of branches evolving at separate rates (μ1, μ2, μ3). The likelihood of each
model incorporating rate variation was compared with
that of the relevant constant rate model. In each case, the
likelihood of the constant rate model was improved significantly by incorporating a Γ-distribution for insertion/
deletion rates (Table 1).
To apply the improved maximum likelihood estimation
to a broad spectrum in the bacterial domain, 173 complete bacterial genomes in 25 phylogenetic groups
(including Bacillus) were examined. Genomes were
selected to be within the same group based on the same
genus name in the NCBI taxonomy database and whenever at least four genomes from the same genus were completely sequenced. Following previous studies,
Oceanobacillus iheyensis and Geobacillus kaustophilus were
included in the Bacillus group [13] and Ureaplasma urealyticum was included in the Mycoplasma group [8]. Since
some highly diverged Synechococcus species are closely
related to Prochlorococcus species [59], the group of Synechococcus in this study only includes Synechococcus sp.
strains. Genome sequences were obtained from the NCBI
database [60]. Sixteen non-ribosomal protein coding
genes from commonly present genes [21,22] were chosen
for phylogeny construction, and they are argS, gcp, gltX,
hisS, infB, ksgA, lysS, metG, nusA, nusG, pheS, proS, rpoA,
secY, serS, and ychF. In each group, any duplicated genes of
these 16 genes were excluded from phylogeny construction for that group. The phylogeny of each group was constructed from the concatenated DNA sequences of these
genes using MRBAYES [61] (200,000 generations sampled
every 100 generations with a Γ distribution model and
invariant class). For convenience, this tree is called the
select-genes tree. The species information of each group
together with outgroup information, genes used for phylogeny construction of each group, and the best supported
phylogenetic tree are given as supplementary information
at [25]. If more than one possible phylogeny was generated for a group, all possible phylogenies were used for
further analysis, weighed by their posterior probabilities.
The robustness of these phylogenies was further assessed
by concatenating all common genes from each group
(labelled the common-genes tree to distinguish it from
the select-genes tree). As for selected genes, common
genes that have paralogs were excluded from the analysis,
to avoid the confounding effects of duplication. The
number of genes (and characters) from each group are
given in Additional file 4. Sequence alignment was performed individually for each gene using MUSCLE [62].
Aligned sequences were concatenated for phylogenetic
analysis. Since MRBAYES [61] has a limitation for the
maximum number of characters, DNAML in the PHYLIP

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/235

package was used instead and the rate variation parameter
alpha was estimated using the PUZZLE program [63].
A supertree method was then employed for the groups in
which the select-genes tree and common-genes tree are
not topologically identical. Genes present in at least 4 taxa
were used for phylogeny construction. A supertree was
computed by assuming equal weight on all phylogenies
using the CLANN program [64]. When the supertree does
not support either the select-genes tree or the commongenes tree, the supertree topology is additionally as supplementary information at [25]. Please note that reconstructed supertrees themselves do not have branch length
information. When needed, branch length information
was estimated from the selected genes by forcing a supertree topology.
Average branch length was used as an indicator for the
degree of the divergence in that group. The method to
identify members of a gene family has been described in
[8]. This study focuses on the presence/absence pattern of
each gene family rather than individual gene; thus, varied
number of genes (e.g. duplicated genes) in a gene family
within the group of organisms would not be taken into
consideration in the analysis. Non-annotated genes were
recovered from the whole genome DNA sequences using
a TBLASTN search [65] with annotated genes as query
sequences, and predicted ORFs that are present in only
one genome but do not have homologues detected in any
other complete genomes by BLAST were removed from
further analysis. In addition, genes encoding proteins that
are less than 100 amino acids in length were removed
from further analysis in this study, since a similarity
search using BLAST has less power to detect homologues
in short sequences [65].
Informational genes in each genome were identified by
applying the COG classification (Clusters of Orthologous
Groups of proteins) [66]. All available protein sequences
with functional annotation from bacterial genomes were
downloaded from the COGs database [67]. There are
24,797 genes from 50 complete bacterial genomes
involved in information storage and processing according
to the COG classification (categories J, A, K, L, and B in
COGs). A reciprocal BLASTP search was conducted to
identify the homologues of informational proteins in the
studied genomes. Significant hits were required to have
expect values less than 10-20 and match over 85% of the
length of the query protein (10-20 + 85%). Different cutoffs (10-10 + 70%, 10-05 + 50%) were also examined to
avoid the ambiguity of one cutoff threshold (Additional
file 10). Genes that have significant hits with any informational genes were identified as informational genes. Rate
variation for gene insertions/deletions was estimated after
informational genes were excluded, and for comparisons,

excluded and the same number of randomly chosen genes
were removed. Rate variation for insertions/deletions of
informational genes was estimated in the same manner.
