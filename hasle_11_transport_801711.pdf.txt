Transport of Babesia venatorum-infected Ixodes
ricinus to Norway by northward migrating
passerine birds

Abstract
Background: Bovine babesiosis is regarded as a limited health problem for Norwegian cows, and the incidence
has decreased markedly since the 1930s. Rare cases of babesiosis in splenectomised humans from infection with
Babesia divergens and B.venatorum have been described. The objective of this study was to determine whether
birds can introduce Babesia-infected ticks. There are between 30 and 85 million passerine birds that migrate to
Norway every spring.
Methods: Passerine birds were examined for ticks at four bird observatories along the southern Norwegian coast
during the spring migrations of 2003, 2004 and 2005. The presence of Babesia was detected in the nymphs of
Ixodes ricinus by real-time PCR. Positive samples were confirmed using PCR, cloning and phylogenetic analyses.
Results: Of 512 ticks examined, real-time PCR revealed five to be positive (1.0%). Of these, four generated products
that indicated the presence of Babesia spp.; each of these were confirmed to be from Babesia venatorum (EU1).
Two of the four B. venatorum-positive ticks were caught from birds having an eastern migratory route (P< 0.001).
Conclusions: Birds transport millions of ticks across the North Sea, the Skagerrak and the Kattegat every year. Thus,
even with the low prevalence of Babesia-infected ticks, a substantial number of infected ticks will be transported
into Norway each year. Therefore, there is a continuous risk for introduction of new Babesia spp. into areas where I.
ricinus can survive.

Background
Ticks have limited mobility [1], but can be transported
over long distances when feeding on their vertebrate
hosts. In particular, avian hosts can efficiently transport
ticks across geographical barriers such as oceans and
deserts [2-6].
Norway is in the northernmost range for the distribution of Ixodes ricinus, which is a vector for many human
and animal pathogens [7]. In a review by Gorenflot [8],
83% of the 28 European cases of human babesiosis
occured in splenectomised individuals, and 76% were
reported to be due to Babesia divergens. Apicomplexans
of the genus Babesia have greater vertebrate host specificity than other tick-borne pathogens, such as Borrelia
spp. and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. None of the

described Babesia species can have both bird and mammal hosts [9,10]. The first report of Babesia canis in
Norway occurred recently; the tick was found on a dog
that had not been abroad [11]. The main vector for B.
canis is Dermacentor reticulatus, which is not native to
Norway. However, a larva of Dermacentor sp. was recovered on a northward-migrating willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus) in Akeröya in 2005 [6]. B. divergens,
which causes redwater disease in cattle, is widespread in
Europe [12]. This pathogen was first described in Norway in 1901 [13] and has been recovered and confirmed
in Norway, using molecular tools (Ø. Øines unpublished
results). A comparison of the data of Thambs-Lyche
from the 1930s [14] with data from the Norwegian
Dairy Herd Recording System (NDHRS) indicates that
the incidence of babesiosis in Norwegian cattle has
decreased, although the infection remains highly prevalent in some coastal locations in Norway such as Lista
(longitude E 6.7°) (47% of 34 tested cows had antibodies

against B. divergens) and the island Jomfruland (longitude E 9.6°) (68%, N = 25) [15]. Lundsett tested 439
flagged ticks along the southern Norwegian coast
(although not specifically in cow-pasturing areas) and
found only a single tick that was positive for B. divergens by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis [16].
Radzijevskaja and colleagues [17] found no Babesia sp.
in 91 ticks (16 adults and 75 nymphs) collected from
Jomfruland in Norway. There are no data to support the
presence of other Babesia species related to B. divergens
in Norway. However, in this study, we report the presence of B. venatorum (Babesia species, EU1) in ticks
found on migratory birds. This species was first characterised by Herwaldt in 2003 [18] and has been recovered
from roe deer in Slovenia [19] and France [20] and from
I. ricinus [21,22]. Three cases documenting infection
with this species in splenectomised humans [18,23] have
raised concern for B. venatorum becoming an emerging
tick-borne human disease.
The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence
of Babesia on ticks collected from northward migratory
birds arriving in Norway and to document the potential
for spread of this parasite across the sea. This is the first
report finding Babesia on ticks from birds. In comparison, a Polish study [24] did not detect Babesia in 442
tick specimens collected from birds.

Materials and methods
Four Norwegian bird observatories along 300 km of the
southern Norwegian coast were involved in the study;
from west to east, these included Lista, Jomfruland,
Store Færder and Akerøya [6]. At Akerøya, six hours of
flagging yielded five ticks, and at Store Færder, two
hours of flagging did not yield any ticks. Although the
yield of ticks may vary through the day and through the
season, our experience is that ticks are detectable at any
time during spring, summer and autumn at localities
where they occur. Therefore, it is questionable whether
these two islands have any local tick populations. By
contrast, ticks are common on Jomfruland and on the
mainland locality of Lista [6]. There are pasturing cattle
in Jomfruland and Lista, but there are only pasturing
sheep at Akerøya or Store Færder, and no cattle or cervid animals. Altogether, 9,768 passerine birds on northward migration were caught with mist nets during the
spring migrations of 2003, 2004 and 2005. The birds
were examined for ticks around the eyes, beak and ear
openings. The ticks were picked off with tweezers and
placed in 70% ethanol for subsequent examination. One
vial was used for each bird, and tweezers were sterilised
with a flame between uses.
The ticks were examined using a stereomicroscope for
species identification and for estimation of feeding status. In total, 1,440 nymphs and 517 larvae were found

on 713 birds. Five species of ticks were found [6]. However, only Ixodes ricinus was included in this study. At
the sites in Jomfruland and Lista, it was necessary to
minimise the inclusion of ticks from resident birds.
Therefore, for these two locations, we analysed only
fully or almost fully engorged tick nymphs collected
from birds caught before or during the peak migratory
arrival time for each species, as engorgement is not evident during the first 24 hours following attachment
[25]. To avoid including unengorged specimens, only
obviously thickened nymphs were recorded as engorged.
Because there were very few ticks on Akerøya and Store
Færder, we examined all nymphs collected from birds at
these two sites for pathogens. Larvae were not included
in this study, as there was considerable uncertainty as to
whether the reduced amounts of Babesia DNA obtained
from larvae, in comparison to that from nymphs, would
alter the sensitivity of the test. In total, 512 ticks were
selected for examination. Of these, 332 were engorged
and were from all the locations and 180 were unengorged or slightly engorged and were from the two locations assumed not to have resident tick populations.
The specimens were crushed with the tip of a glass
rod, which was discarded after each use, and DNA was
isolated using a spin-column method, using the DNeasy
Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To avoid interspecimen contamination,
the ticks were handled with tweezers that were flamedecontaminated after each use. Engorged and unengorged ticks were treated using the same methods. A
contract laboratory, Telelab (now Unilabs Telelab,
Skien, Norway), performed the initial screening of the
samples using real-time PCR to detect B. divergens
DNA published by Radzijevskaja et al. [17]. The PCR
mix consisted of 5 μL BdiF (3 pmol/μL), 5 μL BdiR (9
pmol/μL), 2 μL BdiT (5 pmol/μL), 8 μL PCR water and
25 μL TaqMan Universal PCR Mastermix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in a total volume of 45
μL per sample, with 5 μL of sample DNA or control
(dH2O). After heat activation at 93°C for 10 minutes,
the two-step PCR protocol consisting of the following
steps ran for 40 cycles: denaturation at 94°C for 15 seconds and annealing/extension at 60°C for 60 seconds.
Signals were read using an Applied Biosystems AB7000
sequence-detection system and were calculated against a
dilution series of synthetic amplicon DNA supplied by
Applied Biosystems and standards of B. divergens DNA
(30,000, 3,000, 300 and 30 DNA copies). Only signals
above the threshold line (ΔRn = 1e-1) at or before cycle
(Ct) 37 were interpreted as a positive. DNA from the
five positive samples were then used for the two separate nested PCR reactions described by Zintl and collagues [26]. PCRs were performed with two positive
controls (B. divergens and B. gibsoni) in each run. The

multiple PCR products were cloned using One Shot®
TOP-10 E.coli TA Cloning ® by Invitrogen (Carlsbad,
USA) and pCR®2.1 plasmid. Transformed bacteria were
grown overnight at 37°C on LB agar plates containing
75 μg/ml ampicillin and X-gal. From each PCR sample
that was cloned, 16 to 24 white colonies were selected
and used as templates for a PCR reaction using M13reverse and T7 primers. Several of these PCR products
were sequenced using these primers at Macrogen Europe (http://www.macrogen.com). Chromatograms were
edited, trimmed for vector contamination and assembled
using Contig Express in Vector Nti Advance® 11.5 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). An initial BLASTN search
(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) for several of the
sequence assemblages made in Contig Express revealed
matches for sequences from Ixodes, uncultured eucaryotes and other non-Babesia targets. However, many of
the sequence assemblages produced matches for Babesia. Cloned sequences from one of the five samples did
not match any Babesia entries in BLASTN searches
even after repeated PCR and cloning. The remaining
four samples, however, contained cloned sequences
matching Babesia 18S DNA from the databases. Each of
the nested PCR products were assembled using highquality chromatograms into a single sequence.
Sequences extending beyond the nested PCR primers
were deleted to avoid any confounding errors introduced by the primers. The two nested PCRs reported by
Zintl and colleagues [26] target two regions of 18S DNA
in separate PCRs (5’ and the 3’) and produce two nonoverlapping sequences due to deletion of regions protruding from the annealing sites of the primers. The 472
bp 5’ and 534 bp 3’ sequences from each clone were
found to contain no more than 3 nucleotide ambiguities
(substitutions, deletions or polymorphisms) when compared to the sequence of Babesia EU1 GQ888709. This
corresponded to a maximum difference of 0.6% from
this ‘backbone’ sequence.
It is possible that the infrequent substitutions found in
the individual chromatogrammes were due to errors
from the Taq-polymerase or basecalling or that they
may represent intra-host nucleotide differences from
Babesia present in each sample. However, when applying the principle of the majority rule to the chromatograms, these substitutions would be eliminated hence
producing sequences identical to the GQ888709 Genbank entry for B. venatorum (EU1). The two non-overlapping sequences from the separate nested PCR’s were
included in an alignment that consisted of 18S
sequences from each of the following Babesia species: B.
gibsoni (AB118032), B. odocolei (AY237638), B. divergens
(AY572456), B. capreoli (AY726009), B. canis canis

(EU1) (GQ888709 and HQ830266). The alignment was
exported to MEGA 5 [27], and a Neighbor-joining tree
was constructed using 500 bootstrap replicates with
pairwise deletion of gaps and missing data. The nucleotides in positions 505-992 and 1090-1626, relative to the
complete alignment, were included in a single phylogenetic analysis which used the sequence data produced
by the two nested PCRs.
The National Board of Animal Experimentation
approved the field collecting and handling of the birds.

Results
Thirty-three species of birds carrying I. ricinus nymphs
were collected. Of the 512 nymphs investigated, 114
(22.2%), 98 (19.1%), 54 (10.5%), 40 (7.8%), 38 (7.4%), 31
(6.1%), 23 (4.5%), 22 (4.3%) and 14 (2.7%) were found
on Erithacus rubecula, Turdus merula, Turdus philomelos, Phoenicurus phoenicurus, Prunella modolaris, Phylloscopus trochilus, Sylvia curruca, Turdus iliacus and
Sylvia atricapilla, respectively. Only two ticks were
found on Luscinia svecica and one on Phylloscopus trochiloides, and these are the only bird species in this
material that have an eastern migratory route. Initial
real time analysis revealed five specimens to be positive
for the presence of Babesia sp. Subsequent PCR and
cloning confirmed four specimens, collected from a
robin (Erithacus rubecula) in Akerøya (cycle thresold:
Ct = 30), a greenish warbler (Phylloscopus trochiloides)
in Jomfruland (Ct = 24) and a bluethroat (Luscinia svecica) (Ct = 24) and a dunnock (Prunella modularis)
from Store Færder (Ct = 27), to be positive. The disproportionality between Babesia-positive ticks caught from
birds with an eastern versus a western migratory route
was highly siginficant, i.e., P< 0.001 (Fisher’s exact test
for count data, run in the software R [28]).
Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences obtained after
cloning of the samples using a Neighbor-joining tree
indicated a very high support for the unknown sequence
to belong to Babesia venatorum (EU1) (GQ888709)
(Bootstrap > 99) (Figure 1).
Discussion
The real-time PCR used for screening was initially
reported to be specific for B. divergens [17]. However, in
this study we report the detection of B. venatorum using
this method. In addition, the primer set and probe is
capable of generating positive signals with DNA from
other Babesia species, such as B. canis canis and B. gibsoni (Ø. Øines unpublished results). The fifth sample
that was not confirmed to contain Babesia was only
marginally positive in the real-time PCR, as it produced

that included 1,025 base pair positions (472+534) of the 18S Babesia

a signal close to the threshold line at 37 cycles, i.e., Ct =
36. This could indicate that either any Babesia DNA
may have been present in this sample at concentrations
that were too low to allow for verification using the procedures described previously, or, it could indicate that
the cycle threshold (Ct) was set too high when selecting
for positive samples. Hence positive signals would be
false positives, due to unspecific products amplified in
the real-time analysis.
Some bird species are partly migratory, with only a
fraction of the individuals wintering in Norway [29].
Therefore, for a conservative approach, we only used
engorged nymphs caught before or during the peak
migratory arrival time in localities where ticks are endemic. In addition, three of the four bird species on which
B. venatorum was found are not known to winter in
Norway [29], and three Babesia samples were collected
from birds on Akerøya and Store Færder (Table 1)

where it seems to be no I. ricinus ticks [6]. Thus, it
appears reasonable to conclude that the ticks infected
by B. venatorum were brought to Norway by the birds
they were feeding on. The low number of Babesia-positive nymphs was insufficient for analyses comparing differences in the prevalence of these nymphs by bird
species. The robin and dunnock belong to the great
majority of birds that migrate to Norway via the Atantic
coast of continental Europe [29]. The greenish warbler
does not breed west of Gothland, Sweden [30] and is
very rarely encountered in Norway, and the bluethroat
is one of the few birds that migrate to Norway via an
eastern migratory route [29]. Thus, two of the four B.
venatorum-positive ticks were collected from the minority of birds that came from Eastern Europe, indicating
that B. venatorum may be more common in Eastern
Europe.
B. venatorum (Babesia EU1) had previously not been
reported in Norway. Thus, we did not expect to find
this parasite and not B. divergens, which is a widespread
and common parasite of cattle [12,15]. Duh et al. found
B. venatorum in 11 and B. divergens in 28 of 51 roe
deers that were tested [19]. The host range for B. venatorum is poorly understood, and apart from splenectomised humans, a literature search on the Internet
(http://www.scholar.google.com) revealed no natural
hosts besides roe deer or any other tick vector than I.
ricinus for B. venatorum.
Few B. venatorum-positive ticks were found on migratory birds in this study. There are 30-85 million passerine birds that migrate to Norway every spring [31],
which may carry 0.2 ticks on average (nymphs and larvae) across the sea during their spring migration [6]. B.
divergens has been shown to be transmitted transovarially and transstadially in the tick [32]. Therefore, larvae
are as likely as nymphs to carry the pathogen. Assuming
a prevalence of infection less than 1%, as was obtained
in this study, birds could introduce on the order of
100,000 Babesia-infected ticks per year. Therefore, the
spring migration represents an important component in
the mechanism of the spread of tick-borne pathogens.
Although theoretically possible, birds have not been

Hasle et al. Acta Veterinaria Scandinavica 2011, 53:41

shown to be responsible for the introduction of new
tick-borne pathogens. This study shows that such introduction of B. venatorum is possible. Evidence suggests
that the transport of ticks by migratory birds into Norway has increased over the last four decades [6], and it
is possibile that B. canis, recently described for the first
time in Norway [11], may have been introduced by ticks
on migratory birds.
