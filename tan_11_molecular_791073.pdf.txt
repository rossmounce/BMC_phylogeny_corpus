Abstract
Background: Insecticide resistance jeopardizes the control of mosquito populations and mosquito-borne disease
control, which creates a major public health concern. Two-dimensional electrophoresis identified one protein
segment with high sequence homology to part of Aedes aegypti iron-responsive element binding protein (IRE-BP).
Method: RT-PCR and RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA end) were used to clone a cDNA encoding full length IREBP 1. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was used to evaluate the transcriptional level changes in the Cr-IRE strain Aedes
aegypti compared to the susceptible strain of Cx. pipiens pallens. The expression profile of the gene was established
in the mosquito life cycle. Methyl tritiated thymidine (3H-TdR) was used to observe the cypermethrin resistance
changes in C6/36 cells containing the stably transfected IRE-BP 1 gene of Cx. pipiens pallens.
Results: The complete sequence of iron responsive element binding protein 1 (IRE-BP 1) has been cloned from
the cypermethrin-resistant strain of Culex pipiens pallens (Cr-IRE strain). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that
the IRE-BP 1 transcription level was 6.7 times higher in the Cr-IRE strain than in the susceptible strain of 4th instar
larvae. The IRE-BP 1 expression was also found to be consistently higher throughout the life cycle of the Cr-IRE
strain. A protein of predicted size 109.4 kDa has been detected by Western blotting in IRE-BP 1-transfected
mosquito C6/36 cells. These IRE-BP 1-transfected cells also showed enhanced cypermethrin resistance compared to
null-transfected or plasmid vector-transfected cells as determined by 3H-TdR incorporation.
Conclusion: IRE-BP 1 is expressed at higher levels in the Cr-IRE strain, and may confer some insecticide resistance
in Cx. pipiens pallens.

Background
Mosquitos are one of the medically important insects
closely related to the life of human beings. The harm
caused by mosquitoes to human beings is not only
because of the harassment and blood feeding habits, but
also in the transmission of various diseases, such as
malaria [1], filariasis [2], yellow fever [3], dengue [4],
and Japanese encephalitis [5]. It requires enormous
efforts to overcome these diseases, which include

environmental management, the use of insecticides and
repellents, vaccine research and biological mosquito
control [6-8]. Insecticides play a central role in controlling mosquitoes, but today, more and more serious
insecticide resistance has appeared in mosquitoes, and
against every chemical class of insecticides, such as
Organochlorine, carbamate, organophosphate, pyrethroid and insect growth regulators [9-11]. Insecticide
resistance jeopardizes the control of mosquito populations and mosquito-borne disease control, which creates
a major public health concern [12-14].
Pyrethroids [15] are a group of chemicals that interact
with insect ion channels causing a disruption to

transmembrane potentials, therefore interfere with the
normal functions of the insect nerve system. As a member of pyrethroids, cypermethrin [16] is commonly used
for the treatment of bed nets and as a residual spray to
help control mosquito population and disease transmission, such as malaria. Unfortunately the wide spread use
and incorrect application of cypermethrin and other
synthetic pyrethroids has accelerated the emergence of
resistance in both targeted Anopheles species and offtarget species such as Cx. pipiens pallens [17]. The elucidation of the resistance mechanism becomes important to guide the use of cypermethrin and the
development of its substitutes.
To study the mechanism of cypermethrin resistance, a
resistant strain of Cx. pipiens pallens, Cr-IRE, has been
previously established in the laboratory of Shandong
Institute of Parasitic Diseases by selecting stadium larvae
with increasing concentrations of cypermethrin over 39
generations, and the cypermethrin-resistant level is
160.43 times higher than that of the sensitive strain
[18]. Two-dimensional electrophoresis was used to
screen differences in protein expression (Data not
shown). One of the identified protein segments has high
sequence homology to part of Aedes aegypti ironresponsive element binding protein (IRE-BP). Iron is
necessary for a number of essential cell functions but, as
excessive amounts can be toxic, iron metabolism is carefully controlled at both cellular and systemic levels. One
of the iron homeostasis regulatory proteins is IRE-BP.
IRE-BP is a cytosolic protein that binds a highly conserved sequence in the untranslated regions of mRNAs
involved in iron metabolism including ferritin, IRE-BP 1
receptor, and erythroid 5-aminolevulinate acid synthase
[19]. IRE-BPs has remained highly conserved during
evolution. Iron-responsive elements (IREs) are regulatory RNA elements, which serve as specific binding sites
for the IRE-binding protein (IRE-BP). Interaction
between IREs and IRE-BP induces repression of ferritin
mRNA translation and IRE-BP 1 receptor mRNA stabilization [20]. But the correlation between the function of
IRE-BP 1 and insecticide resistance has not been
reported to date.
In the present study, we utilized RT-PCR and RACE
(rapid amplification of cDNA end) to clone a cDNA
encoding full length IRE-BP 1. The nucleotide sequence
of the clone was subsequently determined. Real-time
quantitative RT-PCR indicated that this gene is transcribed to a greater extent in the Cr-IRE strain than in
the susceptible strain of Cx. pipiens pallens. We also
established the expression profile of the gene in the
mosquito life cycle. Increased cypermethrin resistance in
C6/36 cells containing the stably transfected IRE-BP 1
gene provided further support for a role of IRE-BP 1 in
cypermethrin resistance in Cx. pipiens pallens.

Materials and methods
Mosquitoes

Cr-IRE strain and the susceptible strain of Cx. pipiens
pallens mosquitoes used in this study were reared at 28°
C with 70-80% humidity and a constant light:dark cycle
(14:10). The mosquitoes were fed with mouse blood.
The Cr-IRE colony has been selected from a susceptible
strain [18], and the resistance has been maintained by
treatment with cypermethrin at LC50 of each generation.
The LC50 of Cr-IRE strain is 3.322 mg/L, 81-fold greater
than that in the susceptible strain (0.041 mg/L).

extracted using a plasmid mini kit (Qiagen) and
sequenced using the T7 promoter by Invitrogen Company (Applied Biosystems model 3730; Shanghai Invitrogen BioTech Company, Shanghai, China).
After the 5’ and 3’ part of the sequence was obtained,
a pair of forward primer (Primer 5, Table 1) and reverse
primer (Primer 6, Table 1) was designed so that the full
length cDNA of the gene could be obtained. RT-PCR
conditions were: initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min,
followed by 32 cycles at 95°C for 1 min, 61°C for 1.5
min and 72°C for 2 min 30 s with a final 10-min extension at 72°C. The cDNA fragment obtained was ligated
into a pGEMT-easy vector and sequenced. The NCBI
database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/ was used
to perform similarity searches and retrieve homologous
sequences. The sequence analysis tools from the
SWISS-PROT Internet server were used to process the
data for the deduced protein sequences. Multiple
sequence alignment was conducted using the DNAman
software (version 4.13; Lynnon BioSoft, Quebec,
Canada). The sequences included in our analysis for

Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis

b-actin (forward: Primer 9, Table 1; reverse: Primer 10,
Table 1). To confirm the accuracy and reproducibility of
real-time quantitative RT-PCR, the experiment was
determined in three repeats within one LightCycler run.
The results for IRE-BP 1 were normalizb-actin (forward:
Primer 9, Table 1; reverse: Primer 10, Table 1). To confirm the accuracy and reproducibility of real-time quantitative RT-PCR, the experiment was determined in
three repeats within one LightCycler run. The results
for IRE-BP 1 were normalib-actin (forward: Primer 9,

accuracy and reproducibility of real-time quantitative
RT-PCR, the experiment was determined in three
repeats within one LightCycler run. The results for IREBP 1 were normalized to the housekeeping b-actin gene.
The threshold cycle (Ct) values were used to quantify
the target gene expression for each sample and amplification fold of IRE-BP 1 in Cr-IRE and in the susceptible
strain of Culex pipiens pallens was calculated using the

Page 3 of 12

2 -ΔΔCt method [22]. The real-time PCR analysis was
repeated three times with independent samples.
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of different life cycle

RT-PCR was also done with samples isolated from CrIRE strain egg, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th instar larvae, pupa
and female adult mosquitoes to confirm the expression
levels at each developmental stage using the primers
described above. Mosquito b-actin gene cDNA was
amplified by PCR using the forward primer (Primer 11,
Table 1), and the reverse primer (Primer 12, Table 1).
The PCR conditions were: 95°C for 5 min followed by
25 cycles of 95°C for 40 s, 53°C for 40 s, 72°C for 1 min
with a final 10-min extension at 72°C. The IRE-BP 1
and b-actin gene PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels. Gels were photographed
using Molecular Analyst 1.4.1 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA)
and the images were analyzed by using BandScan 5.1
software. The magnitude of IRE-BP 1 expression in CrIRE strain compared to the cypermethrin sensitive strain
was calculated by the following formula: (RL/Rb)/(SL/
Sb). RL is the band intensity of Cr-IRE strain IRE-BP 1,
Rb is the band intensity of Cr-IRE strain b-actin, SL is
the band intensity of susceptible strain IRE-BP 1 and Sb
is the band intensity of susceptible strain b-actin.
Construction of the expression vector

The entire coding region of IRE-BP 1 was amplified by
PCR using the specific primers designed. The reverse
primer was designed to remove the original stop codon
and maintained the reading frame through the DNA
encoding the C-terminal peptide. The forward primer:
(Primer 13, Table 1), and the reverse primer: (Primer
14, Table 1). The PCR conditions were: 95°C for 5 min,
followed by 32 cycles at 95°C for 1 min, 61°C for 1.5
min and 72°C for 2 min 30 s with a final 10-min extension at 72°C. The PCR product was purified from the
gel following electrophoresis using a quick Gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The purified PCR product was ligated
with T4 DNA ligase to the pIB/V5-His-TOPO vector
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA), and the ligation reaction
solution was transformed into TOP10 E. coli competent
cells (Invitrogen). Positive clones were identified by
restriction analysis of recombinants with NotI and
BamHI, and by PCR with specific primers and vector
primers. The accuracy of the expression plasmid pIB/
V5-His-TOPO IRE-BP 1 was further verified by
sequencing.
Cell culture and stable transfection

A. albopictus mosquito C6/36 cells were obtained from
the China Center for Type Culture Collection (Wuhan,
China). Cells were maintained in EMEM medium supplemented with 10% (V/V) fetal bovine serum (FBS,

Tan et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:215

Sigma), 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The cells were grown in a 5% CO 2
humidified incubator at 28°C and were plated in a sixwell culture plate prior to transfection. When the cells
were at 50-60% confluence, they were transfected using
Cellfectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, for each well, 2 μg DNA was added
to 100 μl serum-free EMEM medium, then separately, 5
μl Cellfectin reagent was added to 100 μl serum-free
medium, then the two solutions were combined, mixed
gently, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min.
Subsequently, 0.8 ml of serum-free medium was added
to this mixture and the entire mixture was layered on to
cells after washing the cells with antibiotic-free medium.
The cells were incubated with the transfection mixture
for 24 h in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 28°C, and
the transfection medium was then replaced with 2 ml
normal growth medium-containing serum. The cells
were then incubated for an additional 48 h before being
harvested for RT-PCR and Western blotting.
Once it had been confirmed that the cells were
expressing the expected protein, stable expression cell
lines were created according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, a kill curve was performed to test
the cell line for sensitivity to 14 μg/ml blasticidin, which
can kill cells within one week. Forty-eight hours posttransfection, the transfection solution was removed and
fresh medium without blasticidin was added. The cells
were split at a 1:5 ratio and allowed to attach for 20
min before the selective medium was added. The medium was removed and replaced with medium containing
14 μg/ml blasticidin, and the cells were incubated at 28°
C. The selecting medium was replaced every 3-4 days
until clones were observed. Eight days later, the medium
was replaced with medium containing 7 μg/ml blasticidin. The resistant cell lines were isolated using a dilution method until only one colony was found in each
well of a 96-well microtiter plate, after which the plate
was incubated until the colony filled most area of the
well. The cells were harvested and transferred to a 24well plate with 0.5 ml fresh medium containing 7 μg/ml
blasticidin, then the clone was expanded in 12-and 6well plates, and finally a T-25 flask. The cells were analyzed for expression using RT-PCR and Western
blotting.
Isolation of total RNA and RT-PCR analysis of the specific
IRE-BP 1 transcript

Total RNA was isolated from transfected cells by using
Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Five micrograms of isolated total RNA
from each sample was used as a template for firststrand cDNA synthesis. The cDNA was synthesized at
70°C for 5 min, and 0°C for 5 min, then 37°C for 1.5 h

with a random primer using Avian myeloblastosis virus
(AMV) reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa). The reverse
transcriptase was then inactivated at 99°C for 5 min.
PCR amplification of the IRE-BP 1 gene was performed
with the forward gene-specific primer (Primer 15,
Table 1) and the reverse vector primer ((Primer 16,
Table 1) for confirmation of transcriptional expression.
The primers used for b-actin PCR amplification were:
forward (Primer 17, Table 1) and reverse (Primer 18,
Table 1). One microliter of the RT reaction product
was used as the template for routine PCR. The following cycling parameters were used: 95°C for 5 min followed by 25 cycles of 95°C for 1 min, 60°C for 90 s
and 72°C for 2.5 min, followed by a final extension
step of 72°C for 10 min.
Western blot analysis

Protein was extracted from transfected cells by KEYGEN
Total Protein Extraction Kit (Nanjing, China) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions and concentrations
were determined by BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce,
USA). Twenty micrograms of protein per lane was used
for SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. The gels were run for
100 min at 100 V and protein was transferred to a
PVDF membrane at 40 V for 30 min then blocked in
TBST and 5% non-fat dry milk for 2 h. Detection was
done with the diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogenic kit
(Boster BioTech Company, Wuhan, China) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The membrane was
exposed in visible light for 10 min, then washed with
ddH2O to terminate the reaction. Molecular weight was
determined by comparison with molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad).

H-TdR incorporation

C6/36 cells were kept in the presence of various concentrations of cypermethrin (1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 120, 160
and 200 μM) for 72 h before 3 H-TdR incorporation.
Eighteen hours before harvesting, 1lCi of 3H-TdR was
added to the medium of each well. To harvest the cells,
EMEM medium was discarded, and cells were washed
three times with 0.05 M PBS (pH 7.4), and detached
from the microtiter wells by trypsinization. Detached
C6/36 cells were harvested onto glass fiber filter paper
using a mini-MASH II microharvesting device (Whittaker MA Bioproducts, Walkersville, MD) and 3H-TdR
incorporated into C6/36 (cell associated 3H-TdR) was
determined using a Wallac 1414 (WALLAC, Finland)
liquid scintillation counter according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Relative viability (%) was calculated
as the ratio of 3H-TdR reduction in treated cells to that
of control cells (C6/36 cells transfected with vector and
null-transfected C6/36 cells). Each condition was performed in triplicate.

Statistical analysis

The inhibitive effect (E) of the cypermethrin on the cell
viability was described by the equation: E = (Emax*C)/
(EC50+C). Horizontal axis is the concentration of cypermethrin, vertical axis is the inhibition rate; Emax is the
concentration at which maximum effect is reached,
while EC50 (50% effective dose [ED50]) is the concentration at which 50% of the maximum effect is reached.
The 95% confidence intervals were used to determine
significant differences among different cells.

Results
Cloning of IRE-BP 1 full length cDNA

A fragment of the expected size (2706 bp) was cloned
and sequenced. Then the full sequence was accessed by
GenBank (Figure 1, 2, GenBank Accession No.
HM443949). The longest open reading frame encoded
901 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of
98.75 kDa. The predicted isoelectric point is 5.54 by
ExPASy. Amino acid sequence alignment of IRE-BP 1
was conducted by ClustalW software in different species
(Figure 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). Phylogenetic relationships of
IRE-BP 1 among Cx. pipiens pallens and some other
species showed IRE-BP 1 of Cx. pipiens pallens has the
highest homology with Culex quinquefasciatus IRE-BP 1
g (Figure 9). SMART showed there is a typical IRE-BP 1
domain found. SIGNAL P3.0 indicted there that no peptide sequence existed in the sequence.
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis

The IRE-BP 1 exhibited 6.7-fold higher level of transcription in the Cr-IRE strain than in the susceptible
strain. The results suggested that IRE-BP 1 expression
was up-regulated in the Cr-IRE strain (Figure 10).
Expression of IRE-BP 1 gene at various developmental
stages in Cr-IRE and susceptible Cx. pipiens pallens

A 315-bp cDNA fragment was selectively amplified
using the specific primers. The amount of amplified
cDNA product was normalized by comparison with the
amplification product of the b-actin gene from Cx.
pipiens pallens (204 bp). The maximal level of IRE-BP 1
mRNA was detected in adult female mosquito, followed
by the 4th instar larvae and the pupa. In all of the developmental stages, Cr-IRE strain has 3-to 4-fold increase
of IRE-BP 1 transcription compared to the susceptible
strain (Figure 11).
Transcription and expression of IRE-BP 1 in C6/36 cells

A PCR product of the expected size, about 2760 bp, was
observed only in cells that were transfected with the
IRE-BP 1 gene (Figure 12A), confirming that IRE-BP 1
had been transcribed in the transfected cells. Western
blot analysis using anti-His antibodies identified a

Page 5 of 12

protein of 109.4 kDa molecular weight in cells transfected with the IRE-BP 1 gene (Figure 12B), confirming
the exogenous IRE-BP 1 was expressed in C6/36 cells
successfully.
Viability assay

Expression of the IRE-BP 1 gene improved the viability
of cypermethrin-treated C6/36 cells. The EC50 and 95%
confidence intervals of null-transfected cells are 35.24
(31.88-40.17), the EC50 and 95% confidence intervals of
vector-transfected cells are 42.31 (34.19-49.26), and the
EC50 and 95% confidence intervals of IRE-BP 1 transfected cells are 101.34 (91.23-113.71). Obvious cell viability augmentation was observed in the IRE-BP 1
transfected C6/36 cells compared to null-transfected or
vector-transfected cells (Figure 13).

Discussion
Insecticide resistance has become a serious public health
problem, which limited the effectiveness of pest control
and presented an obstacle to the control of vector borne
diseases [12,23,24]. Here we report the characterization
of one cypermethrin resistance associated gene of Cx.
pipiens pallens [25]. The writer reported insecticideresistance ribosomal protein L39 gene of Cx. pipiens
pallens, while other researchers in the same laboratory
identified several genes differentially expressed in cypermethrin-resistant strain of the mosquito previously
[15,26-37]. Some of the candidate genes encode for
enzymes such as chymotrypsin [30], trypsin [34],
CYP450 [29], which are likely involved in more direct
functions, e.g. oxidation of cypermethrin, others are
likely more upstream factors, such as ribosomal protein
L39 [25]. The predicted Culex pipiens pallens IRE-BP 1
protein has many characteristics common to the IRE-BP
1 family, and the Cx. pipiens pallens IRE-BP 1 protein
sequence shared 99.45% identity with that of Cx. quinquefasiatus. These results strongly suggest that this protein is the IRE-BP 1 of Cx. pipiens pallens.
We determined the expression profile of IRE-BP 1
mRNA during the mosquito life cycle. Our results
demonstrated that the levels of IRE-BP 1 expression are
developmentally regulated, and the expression was the
highest in adult mosquitos.
IRE-BP binds to iron-responsive elements (IREs),
which were first identified in the 5’ UTR of ferritin
mRNA and in the 3’UTR of transferrin receptor (TftR)
mRNA. Binding of IRE-BP to IREs is regulated by the
iron status of the cell. Iron starvation activates binding
and thus represses ferritin mRNA translation and stabilizes TfR transcripts in vivo. The effect of changes in
iron availability in vivo can be mimicked by alterations
in the redox environment of IRE-BP in vitro. This
observation has led to the suggestion that IRE-BP

activity is regulated post-translationally by the reversible
oxidation-reduction of cysteinyl sulthydryl groups
important for the interaction of IRE-BP and IREs.
In cells that are iron-depleted, the Fe-S cluster of
cytosolic aconitase is disrupted, resulting in a loss of

aconitase activity and the exposure of the RNA-binding
site so that, as the IRE-BP, it can bind with high affinity
to the IRE [19]. In the presence of adequate iron, the
[4Fe-4S] cluster is reassembled, enzyme activity is
regained, and RNA binding is lost. The binding of the

IRE-BP to the IRE found in the 5’ untranslated region of
transcripts for ferritin or the erythroid form of 5-aminolevulinate synthase down-regulates protein synthesis,
most likely through an inhibition of translation initiation
[38]. In the case of transferrin receptor regulation, five

IREs are found within the 3’ untranslated region of the
transcript and their interaction with the IRE-BP results
in a stimulation of transferrin receptor synthesis by inhibiting degradation of the mRNA [9]. The dynamic properties of the Fe-S cluster in the IRE-BP/cytosolic

aconitase suggested that it might serve as a target for
NO produced in response to glutamatergic stimulation
in neurons. No association between IRE-BP 1 and pyrethroid resistance was established before. In this study,
we found a higher transcriptional level of IRE-BP 1 in
the Cr-IRE strain than in the susceptible strain. Ectopic

expression of IRE-BP 1 in C3/36 cells also increases
resistance against cypermethrin. The up-regulation of
IRE-BP 1 in adult mosquito may be indicative of an
adaptive ability of the mosquito to regulate the synthesis
of other insecticide resistance proteins and consequently
to have enhanced resistance to insecticides. Although

we do not have enough information to pinpoint the
exact role of IRE-BP 1 in cypermethrin resistance, our
results suggest that IRE-BP 1 is a good candidate for
future studies of pyrethroid resistance.
The IRE-BP 1 family spans both vertebrates and invertebrates. It includes serum IRE-BP 1, ovo IRE-BP 1, lactoferrin, melano IRE-BP 1, inhibitor of carbonic

anhydrase, saxiphilin, the major yolk protein in sea
urchins, the crayfish protein, pacifastin, and a protein
from green algae. Most (but not all) contain two
domains of around 340 residues, thought to have
evolved from an ancient duplication event. For serum
IRE-BP 1, ovo IRE-BP 1 and lactoferrin each of the
duplicated lobes binds one atom of Fe (III) and one

carbonate anion. With a few notable exceptions each
iron atom is coordinated to four conserved amino acid
residues: an aspartic acid, two tyrosines, and a histidine,
while anion binding is associated with an arginine and a
threonine in close proximity. These six residues in each

lobe were examined for their evolutionary conservation
in the homologous N- and C-lobes of 82 complete IREBP 1 sequences from 61 different species. Of the ligands
in the N-lobe, the histidine ligand shows the most

Lightcycle-RNA amplification Kit SYBR Green and repeated using
three independently purified RNA samples. The enhancement of
fluorescence was found to be proportional to the initial
concentration of template cDNA. IRE-BP 1 transcript copy numbers
were normalized based on expression of the housekeeping b-actin
from respective strains. Cr-IRE represents Cr-IRE strain and S

variability in sequence. Also, of note, four of the twelve
insect IRE-BP 1s have glutamic acid substituted for
aspartic acid in the N-lobe (as seen in the bacterial ferric binding proteins). In addition, there is a wide spread
substitution of lysine for the anion binding arginine in
the N-lobe in many organisms including all of the fish,
the sea squirt and many of the unusual family members
i.e., saxiphilin and the green alga protein. It is hoped
that this short analysis will provide the impetus to
establish the true function of some of the TF family
members that clearly lack the ability to bind iron in one
or both lobes and additionally clarify the evolutionary
history of this important family of proteins.

Conclusions
In summary, we have cloned the first IRE-BP 1 gene
known from Cx. pipiens pallens. Based on the characteristics of the gene, it is a member of the IRE-BP 1 family.
The data in the present study suggests that IRE-BP 1
may confer some cypermethrin resistance in mosquitoes.
Research carried out to date has provided a basis for
further studies on the gene function associated with
