Abstract
Background: We previously showed that the envelope (env) sequence of a human endogenous retrovirus (HERV)W locus on chromosome Xq22.3 is transcribed in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The env open
reading frame (ORF) of this locus is interrupted by a premature stop at codon 39, but otherwise harbors a long
ORF for an N-terminally truncated 475 amino acid Env protein, starting at an in-frame ATG at codon 68. We set out
to characterize the protein encoded by that ORF.
Results: Transient expression of the 475 amino acid Xq22.3 HERV-W env ORF produced an N-terminally truncated
HERV-W Env protein, as detected by the monoclonal anti-HERV-W Env antibodies 6A2B2 and 13H5A5. Remarkably,
reversion of the stop at codon 39 in Xq22.3 HERV-W env reconstituted a full-length HERV-W Xq22.3 Env protein.
Similar to the full-length HERV-W Env protein Syncytin-1, reconstituted full-length Xq22.3 HERV-W Env is
glycosylated, forms oligomers, and is expressed at the cell surface. In contrast, Xq22.3 HERV-W Env is
unglycosylated, does not form oligomers, and is located intracellularly, probably due to lack of a signal peptide.
Finally, we reconfirm by immunohistochemistry that monoclonal antibody 6A2B2 detects an antigen expressed in
placenta and multiple sclerosis brain lesions.
Conclusions: A partially defective HERV-W env gene located on chromosome Xq22.3, which we propose to
designate ERVWE2, has retained coding capacity and can produce ex vivo an N-terminally truncated Env protein,
named N-Trenv. Detection of an antigen by 6A2B2 in placenta and multiple sclerosis lesions opens the possibility
that N-Trenv could be expressed in vivo. More generally, our findings are compatible with the idea that defective
HERV elements may be capable of producing incomplete HERV proteins that, speculatively, may exert functions in
human physiology or pathology.

Background
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory
demyelinating disease of the central nervous system
affecting primarily young adults. While its precise aetiology is unknown, MS is thought to be a multifactorial
disorder resulting from the interaction of environmental
and genetic factors [1]. A multiple sclerosis-associated
retrovirus (MSRV) has previously been suggested by
cDNA clones that were generated from particle* Correspondence: klemens.ruprecht@charite.de

associated RNA from plasma or supernatants of cultured cells from patients with MS [2-4]. Subsequent
investigations revealed MSRV-related sequences in the
human genome, the human endogenous retrovirus
family type W (HERV-W) [5].
HERVs are considered remnants of ancestral germ line
infections by once active retroviruses and contribute
approximately 8% of the human genome (for review see
[6,7]). Like their exogenous counterparts, HERVs typically consist of an internal region containing gag, pro,
pol, and env genes, flanked by two long terminal repeats
(LTR). The number and phylogenetic relationships
among HERV-W sequences in the human genome have
been addressed before [8,9]. HERV-W is a multicopy

endogenous retroviral family comprising approximately
650 elements. About 280 of those elements contain
internal sequences [8]. Individual HERV-W loci are
defective due to the acquisition of stop-codons, truncations, and deletions. In addition, many HERV-W elements actually represent processed pseudogenes
resulting from retrotransposition by long interspersed
element (LINE) machinery [8,9]. De Parseval et al. identified 13 HERV-W env elements in the human genome
with full-length env genes [10]. Among these, only one
HERV-W env locus on chromosome 7q21.2, named
ERVWE1, has retained an uninterrupted open reading
frame (ORF) for a functional envelope (Env) protein,
termed Syncytin-1, which is likely involved in placental
morphogenesis [10,11].
A number of previous reports have suggested a possible role of Syncytin-1 and/or MSRV Env protein in the
pathogenesis of MS [4,12-19]. MSRV/HERV-W env
RNA is more abundant in autopsied brain tissue from
patients with MS than from controls [12,16,17,19]. A
monoclonal anti-HERV-W Env antibody (mAb 6A2B2)
detects an antigen expressed in actively demyelinating
brain lesions from patients with MS [12,16,18]. Importantly, expression of Syncytin-1 in astrocytes induces
release of mediators that are cytotoxic to oligodendrocytes (the cells responsible for myelination) in vitro, and
the expression of Syncytin-1 in murine models causes
oligodendrocyte loss and demyelination in vivo [16,18].
On the other hand, MSRV Env protein (AAK18189.1)
has been suggested to have superantigen-like properties
[4], and the surface (SU) domain of MSRV Env, which
is 87% identical to Syncytin-1, was reported to have
proinflammatory effects via activation of CD14 and tolllike receptor 4 [15].
Despite the potential involvement of Syncytin-1 and
MSRV Env in MS, the precise origin of MSRV env
sequences and their relation to endogenous HERV-W
env loci has not been clear [19-23]. We recently proposed that formerly reported MSRV env sequences may
be explained as being derived from transcripts of various
genomic HERV-W env loci or from recombinations
among those transcripts [24]. By analogy to data
obtained from a study of transcribed HERV-W env loci
in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC),
and from a study of transcribed HERV-K(HML-2) loci,
it seems possible that those recombinations occurred in
vitro because of template switches of reverse transcriptase during cDNA generation and/or via PCR-mediated
recombinations [24,25].
In particular, our analyses showed that the SU region
and the 5′ part of the transmembrane (TM) region of
the reported MSRV env sequence AF331500 are highly
similar to a HERV-W env locus on human chromosome
Xq22.3, while the 3′ part of the TM region of AF331500

is highly similar to a HERV-W element on chromosome
5p12. Another published MSRV env sequence
(AF127228) was found to be almost identical with the
HERV-W locus on chromosome Xq22.3 as well [24].
The Xq22.3 HERV-W env locus is quite remarkable as
it harbors an almost complete ORF for a full-length
HERV-W Env protein, only interrupted by a single premature stop at codon 39. The longest possible ORF of
HERV-W Xq22.3 env, starting at an in-frame ATG at
codon 68, could produce an N-terminally truncated
HERV-W Env protein of 475 amino acids. Others and
we previously showed that Xq22.3 HERV-W env is transcribed in human PBMC [24,26,27]. Similar to other
transcribed HERV-W elements, the Xq22.3 locus lacks a
5′LTR promotor, suggesting that another upstream promotor drives its transcription [26,27]. While that promotor remains to be identified, Xq22.3 HERV-W env
transcripts indicate that the locus fulfills one essential
prerequisite for protein production.
Intriguingly, it turned out that anti-HERV-W Env
mAb 6A2B2 (detecting an antigen in MS brain lesions,
see above) was raised against a 379 amino acid sequence
encoded by MSRV env clone AF127228, which, except
for two C-terminal amino acid exchanges, is identical to
the Xq22.3 HERV-W Env amino acid sequence [11,24].
Although 6A2B2 may crossreact with Syncytin-1
[11,28,29], these findings open up the possibility that
the protein detected by 6A2B2 in MS lesions may in
fact be derived from Xq22.3 HERV-W env. Nonetheless,
it was unknown whether a protein encoded by Xq22.3
HERV-W env can be expressed in human cells.
We herein show that Xq22.3 HERV-W env is capable
of producing an N-terminally truncated HERV-W Env
protein ex vivo. Reversion of the stop codon at position
39 in Xq22.3 HERV-W env results in the expression of
a reconstituted full-length HERV-W Env protein. We
characterize properties of truncated and reconstituted
Xq22.3 HERV-W Env in comparison to Syncytin-1 and
MSRV Env. We also confirm that mAb 6A2B2 detects
an antigen expressed in placenta and MS brain lesions.
Our data support the idea that not only HERVs with
ORFs for complete retroviral proteins but also defective
HERV elements may be capable of producing pieces of
HERV proteins, which, speculatively, may exert functions in human physiology or pathology.

Results
Expression of an N-terminally truncated Env protein from
HERV-W Xq22.3

We previously found that formerly published MSRV env
sequences (AF331500, AF127228) are highly similar to a
HERV-W env element located on the negative strand of
human chromosome Xq22.3 (nucleotides 106,182,017106,184,757, March 2006 human genome assembly) [24].

The Xq22.3 HERV-W locus represents a HERV-W processed pseudogene [8] and consists of 3′ portions of the
pol gene, the complete env gene, and U3 and R regions
of the 3′LTR (Figure 1A). The primary sequence of the
Env protein encoded by Xq22.3 HERV-W env is shown
in Figure 1B.
To analyze the coding capacity of Xq22.3 HERV-W
env, we PCR-amplified from human genomic DNA a
1862 bp sequence beginning at the ATG at codon 68 of
Xq22.3 HERV-W env and containing the putative 475
amino acid HERV-W env ORF as well as the 3′LTR
portions (Figure 1A). The amplicon was cloned into
phCMV, a eukaryotic expression vector under the
control of a strong hCMV promotor, generating
phCMV-Xq22.3 Env. Another expression plasmid
(phCMV-Xq22.3 Env FL) harboring an 2134 bp insert
comprising the full-length Xq22.3 HERV-W env
sequence was created similarly (Figure 1A).
HeLa cells were transfected with HERV-W Env plasmids for 48 hours, and protein expression was subsequently analyzed by immunoblots. In whole protein
lysates from phCMV-Xq22.3 Env-transfected cells, a
mAb (13H5A5) directed against an epitope in the SU
domain of MSRV Env [15] detected a protein of ~53
kDa and two smaller proteins of ~50 and ~48 kDa (Figure 2A, top panel, left lane). The molecular weight of
the ~53 kDa protein is compatible with the calculated
weight (52.9 kDa) of a 475 amino acid HERV-W Env
protein with a translational start at the ATG at codon
68. In lysates from phCMV-Xq22.3 Env FL-transfected
cells, a ~48 kDa protein became detectable only after
prolonged exposure of the blot membranes (Figure 2B).
No HERV-W Env proteins were observed in HeLa cells
transfected with control plasmids containing inserts in
antisense orientation. Weaker expression from phCMVXq22.3 Env FL, as compared to phCMV-Xq22.3 Env,
may possibly be due to the greater distance between the
CMV promotor and the translational start site in this
plasmid. In addition to the start codon at position 68,
further in-frame ATGs are present at positions 80, 91,
114, and 188 of Xq22.3 HERV-W env (Figure 1B), with
calculated molecular masses of the resulting proteins of
51.5, 50.2, 47.8, and 39.6 kDa, respectively. Additional
smaller proteins observed for phCMV-Xq22.3 Env (Figure 2A and 2B) are thus compatible with Xq22.3 HERVW Env proteins with a translational start at in-frame
ATGs within Xq22.3 HERV-W env. In sum, these data
demonstrate that Xq22.3 HERV-W env has retained a
coding capacity for an N-terminally truncated HERV-W
Env protein that can be expressed ex vivo.
Reconstitution of full-length Xq22.3 HERV-W Env

We generated an expression plasmid (phCMV-Xq22.3
Env FLΔStop) with an uninterrupted ORF for a

Page 4 of 14

full-length 542 amino acid Xq22.3 HERV-W Env protein
by reversing the stop codon (TGA) at position 39 of
Xq22.3 HERV-W env into a tryptophan residue (TGG)
(Figure 1A). For comparative analysis with phCMVXq22.3 Env FLΔStop we included plasmid phCMVMSRV Env (pV14), containing the AF331500 MSRV env
sequence. The structure and possible origin of the
AF331500 MSRV env sequence were previously discussed in detail [24]. Finally, since Synyctin-1 currently
represents the only known functional and thoroughly
characterized HERV-W Env protein [29], we also
employed the phCMV-Syncytin-1 (PH74) expression
vector in this investigation.
Remarkably, reversion of the stop codon in Xq22.3
HERV-W env resulted in the expresssion of a ~75 kDa
Xq22.3 HERV-W Env protein, as detected by mAb
13H5A5 (Figure 2A, top panel). This antibody also
confirmed expression of MSRV Env, with both Xq22.3
Env FLΔStop and MSRV Env proteins having similar
molecular weights. Of note, mAb 13H5A5 did not
detect Syncytin-1. However, a polyclonal rabbit antibody (pAb) against Syncytin-1 readily recognized Syncytin-1 (Figure 2A, bottom panel). The anti-Syncytin-1
pAb, which is directed against the N-terminus of Syncytin-1, did not cross-react with Xq22.3 Env, further
corroborating that Xq22.3 Env is an N-terminally truncated protein. The observed molecular weight of
Syncytin-1 is compatible with results from Cheynet
et al. [29] who reported the full-length Syncytin-1 precursor to be synthesized as a glycosylated 73 kDa protein. It follows that the proteins of approximately
similar weight seen for Xq22.3 Env FLΔStop and
MSRV Env represent complete HERV-W Env precursor proteins as well. Altogether, reversion of the Nterminal stop codon in Xq22.3 env results in the
expression of a “resurrected”, untruncated, full-length
Xq22.3 HERV-W Env precursor protein.
Specificities of different anti-HERV-W Env antibodies for
HERV-W Env constructs

In addition to mAb 13H5A5 and the anti-Syncytin-1
pAb, we also studied the specificity for HERV-W Env
proteins of a pAb directed against the 80 C-terminal
amino acids of Xq22.3 HERV-W Env. This pAb was
generated with the aim of producing a polyclonal rabbit
serum that specifically targets Xq22.3 Env. The Cterminal region of Xq22.3 Env was chosen as it displays
a number of residues different from MSRV Env and
Syncytin-1 (Figure 1B). Indeed, the anti-Xq22.3 Env pAb
detected Xq22.3 Env and Xq22.3 Env FLΔStop, but only
very weakly MSRV Env (Figure 2A, second panel from
bottom). However, it cross-reacted with Syncytin-1,
which precluded its use as a tool for exclusive detection
of Xq22.3 Env.

Figure 2 Eukaryotic expression of Xq22.3 Env. (A) HeLa cells were transfected with three different Xq22.3 Env constructs as well as MSRV Env,
and Syncytin-1. Xq22.3 Env rev and MSRV Env rev contain the respective sequences in reverse orientation and were used as controls. Forty-eight
hours post transfection protein expression was studied by Western blot using the indicated primary antibodies. The arrow marks a nonspecific
band of about 43 kDa seen in immunoblots incubated with mAbs 13H5A5 and 6A2B2. Another nonspecific band of about 70 kDa observed in
immunoblots incubated with 6A2B2 is indicated by an arrowhead. (B) Prolonged exposure of the blot membrane to demonstrate expression of
a protein in HeLa cells transfected with Xq22.3 Env FL but not in HeLa cells transfected with a control plasmid containing Xq22.3 Env in reverse
orientation (Xq22.3 FL Env rev). The Xq22.3 Env lane, which was included for comparison revealed bands ranging between ~40 to ~53 kDa after
overexposure.

We also investigated specificity of mAb 6A2B2 for
proteins produced by the different HERV-W Env
expression vectors. In our hands, 6A2B2 did detect
Xq22.3 Env, Xq22.3 Env FLΔStop, and MSRV Env, but
not Syncytin-1 (Figure 2A, second panel from top). A
band of ~43 kDa was additionally observed in blots
developed with 6A2B2, and infrequently also in blots
developed with 13H5A5. This ~43 kDa band was judged
unspecific as it was also detected in lysates from a cell
line (B95.8) derived from a new world monkey that
lacks HERV-W [30] (data not shown).
Expression of the different HERV-W Env proteins and
specificity of the different HERV-W Env antibodies for
the various HERV-W Env proteins were also investigated by immunocytochemistry. As shown in Figure 3,
results obtained by immunocytochemistry were consistent with the immunoblot data. Noteworthy, the protein
encoded by phCMV-Xq22.3 Env FL was readily detectable by immunocytochemistry, which likely reflects the
higher sensitivity of immunocytochemistry as compared
to immunoblots, and further confirms that phCMVXq22.3 Env FL has coding capacity.

To summarize the specificities, as established by
immunoblot and immunocytochemistry, of all antibodies
employed in this work, mAbs 13H5A5 and 6A2B2
detected Xq22.3 Env, Xq22.3 Env FLΔStop, and MSRV
Env, but not Syncytin-1. The Xq22.3 Env pAb recognized Xq22.3 Env, Xq22.3 Env FLΔStop, and Syncytin-1,
but only very weakly MSRV Env. Finally, the anti-Syncytin-1 pAb reacted with Syncytin-1, Xq22.3 Env FLΔStop,
and MSRV Env, but not with Xq22.3 Env.
Xq22.3 Env is unglycosylated, does not form oligomers,
and is not located to the cell surface

Syncytin-1 has been reported to be a moderately glycosylated protein with seven N-linked glycosylation sites
[29]. By analogy, we studied the glycosylation pattern of
the different HERV-W Env constructs using peptide-Nglycosidase (PNGase F) digestion. In agreement with
previous findings [29], PNGase F treatment reduced the
molecular mass of Syncytin-1 by about 20 kDa (Figure
4A). A similar reduction was observed for Xq22.3 Env
FLΔStop and MSRV Env, demonstrating that these proteins are glycosylated in a pattern similar to Syncytin-1.

cells were transfected for 24 hours with the indicated expression vectors. Xq22.3 Env rev is a control plasmid which contains the Xq22.3 Env
sequence in reverse orientation. Immunocytochemistry was performed on fixed and permeabilized cells with mAbs 13H5A5 and 6A2B2, as well
as an anti-Syncytin-1 pAb. Cell nuclei were stained with 4’,6’-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Magnification × 160.

However, PNGase F treatment did not reduce the molecular mass of Xq22.3 Env, indicating that this protein is
unglycosylated.
To analyze the capacity of the various HERV-W Env
proteins to form oligomers, immunoblots were carried
out under reducing and non-reducing conditions. Nonreducing conditions resulted in several high molecular
weight bands for Syncytin-1, Xq22.3 Env FLΔStop, and
MSRV Env, but no such oligomeric complexes could be
observed for Xq22.3 Env (Figure 4B). While the exact
composition of those higher molecular weight complexes remains to be determined, our results indicate
that Syncytin-1, Xq22.3 Env FLΔStop, and MSRV Env
can oligomerize, whereas Xq22.3 Env cannot.
Surface expression of MSRV Env, Xq22.3 Env
FLΔStop, and Xq22.3 Env was studied by immunocytochemistry of living, unfixed, and unpermeabilized HeLa
cells transfected with respective constructs. Intracellular

expression was analyzed in parallel in fixed and permeabilized cells. Whereas MSRV Env and Xq22.3 Env
FLΔStop were clearly detectable at the cell surface and
in the cytoplasm, Xq22.3 Env was only located in the
cytoplasm, suggesting that Xq22.3 Env is not transported to the plasma membrane (Figure 4C). The results
obtained by immuncytochemistry were confirmed by
flow cytometry experiments in which surface expression
was likewise only detectable for MSRV Env and Xq22.3
Env FLΔStop, but not for Xq22.3 Env (Figure 4D).
A single amino acid mutation inhibits cleavage of HERVW Env Xq22.3 into SU and TM subunits

Cleavage of retroviral Env proteins into SU and TM
moieties occurs at a consensus furin cleavage site with
the canonical motif R/K-X-R/K-R. While this motif is
present in Syncytin-1 (RNKR), a single amino acid of
this motif is mutated in Xq22.3 Env and MSRV Env

(HNKR) (Figure 1B), suggesting that Xq22.3 Env and
MSRV Env might not be properly cleaved. The fact
that the anti-Xq22.3 Env pAb, directed against the Cterminal TM region of Xq22.3 Env, cross-detected
Syncytin-1 enabled us to use this serum as a tool
for studying cleavage of Syncytin-1 and Xq22.3-EnvFLΔStop. In lysates from HeLa cells transfected with
Syncytin-1, the anti-Xq22.3 pAb recognized a protein of
a little less than 30 kDa, most likely corresponding to
the cleaved TM domain of Syncytin-1 (Figure 5, left
panel). Conversely, a TM-representing protein was not
detected for Xq22.3 Env FLΔStop, indicating that this
protein is not cleaved to similar extent as Syncytin-1
into SU and TM subunits. Preadsorption of the antiXq22.3 pAb proved the specificity of the observed bands
(Figure 5, right panel).

with MSRV Env, Xq22.3 Env FLΔStop, or Xq22.3 Env.
This result was somewhat anticipated as the capacity of
Syncytin-1 to fuse cells relies on a four amino deletion
in the intracytoplasmic TM region of Syncytin-1 [28],
and this deletion is neither present in MSRV Env nor in
Xq22.3 Env (see also Figure 1B). In addition, proper
cleavage into SU and TM domains is required for fusogenicity of Syncytin-1 [29]. Absence of the fusogenic
four amino acid deletion and lack of cleavage (Figure 5)
therefore sufficiently explain the inability of Xq22.3
HERV-W Env proteins to induce syncytia.
RNA transcripts from the Xq22.3 HERV-W env locus have
the correct orientation for translation of a Xq22.3 HERVW Env protein

The finding that Xq22.3 HERV-W Env can be expressed
ex vivo opens the possibility that the protein might also
be expressed in vivo. Transcription of mRNA from the
Xq22.3 HERV-W env locus is an essential prerequisite
for such an expression. By using RT-PCR followed by
cloning and sequencing of PCR products, we have previously shown that the Xq22.3 HERV-W env locus is
indeed transcribed in human PBMC [24]. However,
since the reverse transcriptase step in that study
involved random hexanucleotide primers it remained to
be confirmed that the Xq22.3 HERV-W env locus is
transcribed in a sense direction, allowing for subsequent
translation of Xq22.3 HERV-W Env protein. To clarify
this point we performed strand specific reverse transcriptase reactions using primers specific for either
sense or antisense transcripts from the Xq22.3 HERV-W
env locus. Indeed, Xq22.3 HERV-W env mRNA is transcribed in a sense orientation with respect to the Xq22.3
HERV-W env gene; that is, it has the correct orientation
for subsequent translation into a protein (Figure 7).
Cloning and sequencing of the respective amplicon
(Figure 7, lane 2) confirmed that it originated from
Xq22.3 HERV-W env (data not shown).

Monoclonal antibody 6A2B2 detects an antigen
expressed in placenta and acute MS lesions

MSRV Env, Xq22.3 Env FLΔStop, and Xq22.3 Env do not
induce syncytia in HeLa cells

Syncytin-1 is a highly fusogenic protein that induces
syncytia when expressed in cells that express the type D
mammalian retrovirus receptor [11]. We thus analyzed
whether MSRV Env, Xq22.3 Env FLΔStop, or Xq22.3
Env may cause formation of syncytia as well. As
expected, HeLa cells transfected with Syncytin-1 displayed prominent multinucleated syncytia (Figure 6). In
contrast, syncytia were not formed in cells transfected

immunoblot using the anti-Xq22.3 Env pAb as primary antibody,
which recognizes the C-terminus of the TM region of Xq22.3 Env
and Syncytin-1 (see Figure 2B and text). To confirm the specificity of
observed bands, the Xq22.3 pAb was preadsorbed with either TrpE
alone or TrpE fused to the C-terminal amino acid fragment of
Xq22.3 Env which was used for generation of the anti-Xq22.3 Env
pAb.

Previous studies have demonstrated that mAb 6A2B2,
which has been raised against a 379 amino acid fragment that except for two C-terminal amino acid
exchanges is identical to the Xq22.3 HERV-W Env
amino acid sequence [24], reacts with an antigen that is
expressed in human placenta as well as in inflammatory
brain lesions from patients with MS [11,12,16,18]. Having characterized the specificity of mAb 6A2B2 extensively in the present work (Figures 2A, 3), we wanted to
reconfirm those findings. Positive immunoreactivity of
the syncytiotrophoblast cell layer as well as immunoreactivity of cells within the mesenchyme was observed
in human placental tissue stained with mAB 6A2B2

from conventional immunohistochemistry, mAb 6A2B2
showed a diffuse cytoplasmic staining of the syncytiotrophoblast cell layer as well as of cells within the placental

Discussion
We herein show that a processed HERV-W pseudogene
which is located on chromosome Xq22.3 and discloses
an N-terminally truncated 475 amino acid long env ORF
can produce an N-terminally truncated HERV-W Env
protein ex vivo. We named this protein N-Trenv (for Nterminally truncated Env). By analogy to the ERVWE1
gene encoding Syncytin-1, we propose to designate the
Xq22.3 HERV-W env gene that encodes N-Trenv
ERVWE2. While the ERVWE1 gene has been the only
HERV-W env locus shown to be capable of producing a
protein so far, our results establish Xq22.3 HERV-W
env (ERVWE2) as the second HERV-W env element in
the human genome that has retained coding capacity.
Viral membrane glycoproteins, such as retroviral Env
proteins, are normally synthesized in the endoplasmic
reticulum [31]. Targeting of nascent polypeptide chains
of retroviral Env proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum
membrane is brought about by a short stretch of amino
acids at the N-terminus of the protein, the so-called
signal peptide [32]. Due to its N-terminal truncation NTrenv lacks a signal peptide and is therefore very likely
synthesized on free ribosomes. Consequently, N-Trenv
is not expected to undergo the usual maturation steps
of full-length retroviral Env proteins. Indeed, N-Trenv is
an unglycosylated protein, that does not form oligomers
and is not transported to the cell surface. While functional properties of N-Trenv are currently unknown,
those features suggest that in terms of function N-Trenv
may behave quite differently from full-length retroviral
Env proteins. Remarkably, reversion of the premature
stop at codon 39 in ERVWE2 “resurrected” full-length
Xq22.3 HERV-W Env protein which then became glycosylated, formed oligomers, and was expressed at the cell
surface, just like the full-length HERV-W Env protein
Syncytin-1 [29]. A single nucleotide difference in

ERVWE2 can therefore dramatically alter properties of
the ERVWE2 gene product. Nevertheless, unlike Syncytin-1, reconstituted Xq22.3 HERV-W Env does not
appear to be cleaved into SU and TM domains, due to
an amino acid mutation in the furin cleavage motif. As
cleavage is prerequisite for proper Env function, it is
doubtful whether reconstituted Xq22.3 HERV-W Env
could represent a fully functional retroviral Env protein
that confers infectivity on retrovirus particles, as it was
shown for Syncytin-1 [33].
Given the fundamental changes in the properties of
N-Trenv resulting from elimination of the premature
stop codon in ERVWE2, one may speculate whether a
suppression of this stop codon could occur in human

beings in vivo leading to re-expression of full-length Env
with possible functional consequences. Furthermore, it
would be interesting to know whether there exist
ERVWE2 alleles in the human population that lack the
stop codon. An approach to test this hypothesis would
be a genetic one, with a screening for mutations in the
ERVWE2 stop codon in the general population, or at a
more refined level, in certain patient groups, e.g. individuals suffering from MS.
Others and we have previously shown expression of
Xq22.3 HERV-W env transcripts in human PBMC
[24,26,27]. Using strand-specific reverse transcription,
we here confirm that Xq22.3 HERV-W env is transcribed in the correct orientation for subsequent

Roebke et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:69
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/69

translation into a protein. The overall structure of
Xq22.3 HERV-W env transcripts, such as location of
upstream transcription initiator(s), downstream polyadenylation signals, and potential splicing of transcripts,
must be addressed in separate studies.
An obviously important question is whether N-Trenv
may be expressed in the human organism in vivo. As our
analysis showed, mAb 13H5A5 appears to specifically
detect N-Trenv, but not Syncytin-1, and could thus be suited for immunohistochemical studies addressing in vivo
expression of N-Trenv. Indeed, in a previous immunohistochemical study mAb 13H5A5 was shown to detect an
antigen expressed in microglia, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal
human brain tissue and inflammatory MS brain lesions,
which were pretreated for antigen retrieval [13]. These
data point towards the possibility that N-Trenv could be
expressed in normal and diseased human brain in vivo.
Nevertheless, providing definitive proof that the protein
product of a specific HERV locus is expressed in vivo is
not a simple task. For instance, it cannot be excluded that
besides ERVWE2 further defective HERV-W env loci in
the human genome may have the capacity to express
incomplete HERV-W Env proteins that might accidentally
contain the epitope recognized by mAb 13H5A5. If this
was the case, it would be quite challenging to dissect from
which specific HERV-W env locus the observed proteins
precisely originate. Our present and previously reported
findings do therefore not provide formal prove that NTrenv is expressed in vivo, underscoring the complexity of
investigations on HERV protein expression in vivo.
Since mAb 6A2B2 was raised against a 379 amino acid
fragment that is identical to the N-Trenv amino acid
sequence except for two C-terminal amino acid
exchanges [24], detection of N-Trenv, reconstituted fulllength Xq22.3 Env, and MSRV Env by 6A2B2 was
expected. However, in our hands 6A2B2 did not recognize Syncytin-1. This was an unanticipated finding as
6A2B2 has previously been reported to detect Syncytin1 [11,28,29]. A possible explanation for this discrepancy
could be that 6A2B2 recognizes an epitope that is conformational or only exhibited by oligomerized forms of
Syncytin-1 and that was lost under the experimental
conditions applied in our study. Consistent with this
idea, in a previous work which reported detection of
Syncytin-1 by 6A2B2 in an immunoblot, the respective
experiment was carried out under non-reducing conditions [29]. Also consistent with this idea, mAb 6A2B2
was previously shown to react with transiently expressed
Syncytin-1 in flow cytometry experiments, where conformational epitopes should be detectable [29].
However, in double immunofluorescence experiments
of placental tissue with mAb 6A2B2 and anti-Syncytin-1
pAb both antibodies revealed different staining patterns.

Page 11 of 14

Staining with anti-Syncytin-1 pAb was most prominent
at the syncytiotrophoblast membrane. Consistent with
the detection of Syncytin-1 by the anti-Syncytin-1 pAb
in immunoblots and immunocytochemistry, and Syncytin-1 being a membrane-associated protein, this finding
is compatible with the detection of Syncytin-1 at the
syncytiotrophoblast membrane by the anti-Syncytin-1
pAb. In contrast, membrane-associated immunoreactivity was not observed with mAb 6A2B2 which revealed a
more diffuse cytoplasmic staining of the syncytiotrophblast cell layer as well as of cells within the placental
mesenchyme. Altogether, these data suggest that, in
keeping with our findings on the specificity of mAb
6A2B2 for HERV-W Env proteins in immunoblots and
immuncytochemistry, mAb 6A2B2 might also recognize
an antigen that is different from Syncytin-1 in immunohistochemistry. It follows that the immunoreactivity
observed in MS lesions stained with mAb 6A2B2 in former studies [12,16,18] and this work may indicate
expression of an HERV-W Env antigen different from
Syncytin-1 in MS brain lesions. Similar to what has
been discussed above for mAB 13H5A5, while the precise identity of the antigen recognized by mAb 6A2B2
in placental tissue and MS brain lesions remains to be
clarified, N-Trenv is one possibility.
Finally, it is well established that some HERV loci in
the human genome have the capacity to produce proteins that can be expressed under physiological but also
pathological conditions [7,34]. Research in this field has
primarily focused on those few HERV elements that
harbor intact ORFs coding for complete retroviral proteins [10]. Nevertheless, there may be instances in which
short proteins also produced by highly defective HERV
loci may exert a biologically significant function [35].
Our present findings further strengthen the idea that
incomplete or truncated HERV loci also may be capable
of producing pieces of proteins.

Conclusions
In summary, we show that a partially defective HERV-W
env gene on chromosome Xq22.3, that we propose to
name ERVWE2, can produce ex vivo an N-terminally
truncated HERV-W Env protein, named N-Trenv, and
has thus retained a coding capacity. Our own and previously published data are compatible with the possibility that N-Trenv could also be expressed in vivo,
although formal proof is still required. While most of
the numerous HERV elements in the human genome
are defective and have therefore been considered functionless, our present findings suggest that defective
HERV elements in the human genome may be capable
of also producing partial HERV proteins. It is tempting
to speculate that those HERV protein fragments could
play a role in human physiology or pathology.

Methods
Plasmids

Nucleotides 106,181,958-106,184,091 from chromosome
× (human genome March 2006 assembly), containing
the complete Xq22.3 HERV-W env sequence, 71 bp of
the 3′ end of the pol gene, as well as 3′ LTR portions
were PCR-amplified from human genomic DNA. All
primer sequences are available from the authors upon
request. The PCR product was cloned in either sense or
antisense orientation (as control) into the BamHI site of
phCMV, generating phCMV-Xq22.3 Env FL (fulllength). To create an expression vector containing a
complete Xq22.3 HERV-W env ORF (phCMV-Xq22.3
Env FLΔStop), the stop codon (TGA) at codon 39 of
the Xq22.3 HERV-W env sequence present in phCMVXq22.3 Env FL was reverted to tryptophan (TGG) by
employing a PCR-mediated approach. Expression plasmid phCMV-Xq22.3 Env, starting at the first in-frame
ATG (codon 68) downstream from the stop at codon 39
in Xq22.3 HERV-W env and containing the 475 amino
acid ORF of Xq22.3 HERV-W env and the adjacent 3′
LTR sequence was generated by PCR-amplification of
nucleotides 106,181,958-106,183,819 of chromosome ×
from human genomic DNA. The amplicon was introduced in either sense or antisense orientation into the
BamHI site of phCMV. Sequencing of phCMV-Xq22.3
Env and phCMV-Xq22.3 Env FL (GATC Biotech, Konstanz, Germany) confirmed identity with the Xq22.3
human genome sequence (March 2006 assembly) and
reversion of the stop codon in phCMV-Xq22.3 Env
FLΔStop (data not shown). Plasmids phCMV-Syncytin-1
(clone PH74, AF 072506) [11], and phCMV-MSRV Env
(clone pV14, AF 331500) [4] were kindly provided by
Hervé Perron (Geneuro, Switzerland). As an additional
control, we also inserted the MSRV env sequence in
antisense orientation into phCMV.

6A2B2 (IgG1) were a kind gift from Hervé Perron. As
previously discussed in detail, mAb 6A2B2 was raised
against a 379 amino acid sequence encoded by MSRV
env clone AF127228, which is identical to the Xq22.3
HERV-W Env amino acid sequence but for two Cterminal amino acid exchanges [11,24].
Transient expression and characterization of HERV-W Env
proteins

HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells were cultured in
Dulbecco′s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10%
FCS (PAA), penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin
(100 μg/ml). Cells were maintained at 37° C in a 5%
CO2 atmosphere. Cells were free of mycoplasma contamination, as confirmed by PCR (Venor GeM, Minerva
Biolabs). For transient expression of HERV-W Env proteins, HeLa cells were plated into 6-well plates (5 × 105
cells/well) and transfected the following day with different HERV-W Env expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. After approximately 48 hours, cells were
lysed in sample buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 6%
[w/v] sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 10% [v/v] mercaptoproprandiol, 10% [v/v] glycerol), sonicated, and boiled
for 5 minutes. To assay for HERV-W Env oligomers,
mercaptoproprandiol was omitted from the sample buffer and lysates were not boiled. For immunoblot analyses, 15 μg of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE
and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were probed with primary antibodies as indicated and developed with
secondary peroxidase labeled IgG antibodies (Sigma)
and enhanced chemoluminescence. To analyze glycosylation of HERV-W Env proteins, 30 μg of protein were
denatured at 100°C for 10 minutes and digested with
500 Units PNGase F (New England BioLabs) for 4 hours
at 37°C according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Antibodies

Polyclonal anti-Syncytin-1 rabbit antisera (anti-Syncytin1 pAb K342 and K343) were generated as previously
described [36,37] by immunization of rabbits with a
fusion protein consisting of an approximately 6 kDa fragment of the N-terminus of Syncytin-1 and E. coli anthranilate synthetase (TrpE). A polyclonal anti-Xq22.3
HERV-W Env antiserum (anti-Xq22.3 Env pAb) was produced similarly by immunizing rabbits with a fusion protein consisting of the 80 C-terminal amino acids (463542) of Xq22.3 HERV-W Env fused to TrpE (see also
Figure 1A). In competition experiments, the anti-Xq22.3
HERV-W Env antiserum was preadsorbed overnight with
either bacterially expressed TrpE-Xq22.3 HERV-W Env
fusion protein or TrpE alone. The mouse mAb 13H5A5
(IgG1), directed against an epitope in the SU domain of
MSRV Env [15], and peroxidase labeled mouse mAb

Flow cytometry

HeLa cells transfected with the different HERV-W Env
expression vectors were washed with PBS and detached
with 0.02% Versene in PBS. Cells were incubated with
primary antibody 13H5A5, diluted in FACS buffer (PBS,
2% [v/v] FCS), for 1 hour at 4°C, washed with FACS
buffer, and incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanateconjugated anti-Mouse IgG secondary antibody (Sigma).
Cells were washed, resuspended in isotonic NaCl 1%
(v/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) [pH 7,4], and 104 cells/
sample were analyzed using a Beckton Dickinson
FACScan.
Immunocytochemistry

For immunocytochemistry, HeLa cells were plated at
3 × 104 cells per well (growth area 0.9 cm2 per well) on

Roebke et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:69
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/69

microscope slides using flexible 8-well tissue culture
chambers attached onto the slides (flexiPerm, Greiner
Bio-one). The following day, cells were transfected using
Lipofectamine and medium was replaced 4 hours after
transfection. For whole cell staining, cells were washed
one day later with PBS, fixed with 4% (v/v) PFA in PBS,
permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton-X 100 in PBS,
blocked with 10% (v/v) FCS in PBS, and stained with
antibodies diluted in PBS/10% FCS. Following incubation with secondary antibody (goat-anti-rabbit IgG
Alexa Fluor 568, 1:1000, Molecular Probes), cells were
dehydrated in 70%, 80%, and 100% ethanol and
mounted with Vectashield (Vector) medium containing
4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). For surface
staining, living, unfixed, and unpermeabilized cells were
stained on ice with primary antibodies as indicated.
After incubation with secondary antibody, cells were
fixed with PFA. Slides were inspected with a Leitz Aristoplan fluorescence microscope and images were
acquired using AxioVision 3.0 software. Digital acquisition parameters and further processing (Corel PhotoPaint 12) were identical for all images.
Formation of syncytia

HeLa cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells/per well in 6-well
plates and transfected (Lipofectamine 2000) with different HERV-W Env constructs. After 24 hours cells were
stained with May-Grünwald and Giemsa solutions to
visualize syncytia formation and inspected with a Leitz
Aristoplan microscope.
Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemistry was carried out as previously
described [38] on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
post-mortem brain tissue sections from a 76-year old
woman with fulminant MS (Marburg′s variant) as well
as on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections
from normal human placenta. For double immunofluorescence Cy2-conjugated anti-mouse-IgG and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany)
were used as secondary antibodies.
Strand specific RT-PCR

Total RNA was prepared from PBMC using the RNeasy
Mini kit (Qiagen) and eluted into 60 μl of RNase-free
H 2 O dd . RNA concentration and purity was assessed
spectrophotometrically. Contaminating DNA was
removed using the TURBO DNA-free Kit (Ambion Inc.)
following the protocol for rigorous DNAse treatment as
described before [24]. Reverse transcription was carried
out using the Xq22.3 HERV-W env strand-specific primers Sense 5′-GCTGCTGTACAACCAGTAGCTC-3′
and Antisense 5′-TTCTCTTGCCTGACCTTGAAT-3′
and SuperScript III reagents (Invitrogen) at 55°C for

increased specificity. Negative controls were generated
in parallel for each sample by omitting reverse transcriptase from the reaction. PCR was carried out as reported
[24] using above mentioned primers. For further verification PCR products were cloned and sequenced as
described before [24].
