A comparison of SNP and STR loci for delineating
population structure and performing individual
genetic assignment

Abstract
Background: Technological advances have lead to the rapid increase in availability of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in a range of organisms, and there is a general optimism that SNPs will become the marker
of choice for a range of evolutionary applications. Here, comparisons between 300 polymorphic SNPs and 14 short
tandem repeats (STRs) were conducted on a data set consisting of approximately 500 Atlantic salmon arranged in
10 samples/populations.
Results: Global FST ranged from 0.033-0.115 and -0.002-0.316 for the 14 STR and 300 SNP loci respectively. Global
FST was similar among 28 linkage groups when averaging data from mapped SNPs. With the exception of selecting
a panel of SNPs taking the locus displaying the highest global FST for each of the 28 linkage groups, which inflated
estimation of genetic differentiation among the samples, inferred genetic relationships were highly similar between
SNP and STR data sets and variants thereof. The best 15 SNPs (30 alleles) gave a similar level of self-assignment to
the best 4 STR loci (83 alleles), however, addition of further STR loci did not lead to a notable increase assignment
whereas addition of up to 100 SNP loci increased assignment.
Conclusion: Whilst the optimal combinations of SNPs identified in this study are linked to the samples from which
they were selected, this study demonstrates that identification of highly informative SNP loci from larger panels will
provide researchers with a powerful approach to delineate genetic relationships at the individual and population
levels.

Background
The characterisation and availability of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in non-model organisms is
increasing rapidly [1,2], and within the field of population genetics, growing attention is being given to this
class of marker to address a broad range of evolutionary
questions (reviewed by [3,4]).
Highly polymorphic short tandem repeat loci (STR),
commonly known as microsatellites, have been the primary molecular tool of choice for addressing evolutionary questions for nearly two decades. However, these
markers display several negative characteristics including
size homoplasy [5], complex mutational patterns, and
are prone to genotyping errors [6]. Furthermore, STR

scoring is platform dependant [7], making inter-laboratory collaboration a challenge.
In contrast to STR analysis, SNP genotyping reveals
polymorphisms directly in the DNA sequence, circumventing the need for between laboratory calibration.
Furthermore, development of high through-put genotyping platforms permits simultaneous genotyping of thousands of loci, enabling the identification of highly
diagnostic panels [8]. SNPs occur throughout the genome, and thus offer the possibility for detailed information for all regions, which is an advantage in identifying
genes under selection or when mapping genes related to
specific traits. Nevertheless, the implementation of SNPs
to delineate population genetic structure is still in its
infancy outside the field of human genetics (but see
SNPs in cattle e.g., [9-11]) for example where they have
been demonstrated to out-perform microsatellites for
specific questions such as individual ancestry [8].

Several non-human population genetic studies have
compared results obtained from STR and SNP data sets,
however, many comparisons have involved relatively low
numbers of SNP loci [12-16]. Consequently, few nonhuman genetic studies have been able to effectively
investigate how selecting a “highly informative” set of
diagnostic loci from a larger pool, for example by selecting those displaying highest global FST, may influence
and potentially bias genetic relationships among the
populations being studied. Furthermore, few studies
have compared the power of SNPs and STRs to perform
genetic assignment of individuals to populations (but
see [15,16]), but once again, only with modest numbers
of loci. The latter point is important because whereas
genetic relationships may be effectively delineated with
even low to moderate numbers of SNP loci (e.g., [17,18],
the accuracy of genetic assignment may be linked to the
number of independent alleles [19-22], although this is
not necessarily true when comparing between marker
classes [16], or where large resources of SNPs have been
scanned for “highly diagnostic” loci to perform assignment [8].
Individual genetic assignment is an important tool in
the management of domesticated and wild genetic
resources, and has been used in forensic cases to detect
illegal translocations of animals [23,24], illegal trade
[25], fraud [26] and source of origin for escaped domesticated animals [27]. Furthermore, assignment tests have
been used in the investigation of evolutionary processes
in addition to the identification of hybrids [28] and species[29].
The aim of the present study was to compare the performance of a large resource of SNPs (388) and a panel
of STRs (15) to perform individual genetic assignment
and delineate population structure. This was achieved
through genotyping a set of Atlantic salmon (Salmo
salar L.) samples originating from a number of fish
farms in Norway, and, a number of escaped farmed fish.
This species was chosen due to the fact that a large
number of verified SNPs have previously been identified
and mapped [1,2], and, that a high through-put genotyping platform for the analysis of the SNPs existed.

Methods
Biological samples

Domesticated Atlantic salmon can escape from aquaculture facilities into the wild, and in the period 2001-2005,
260 000-715 000 farmed escapees were officially
reported in Norway to the Directorate of Fisheries
annually. However, the true number of escapees is probably higher due to underreporting [30]. In an attempt to
assist the Norwegian authorities in improving regulation
over the aquaculture industry, the Institute of Marine
Research in Norway developed a DNA based forensic

Page 2 of 12

method to identify escaped salmon to farm of origin
[22,27]. In short, this method is based upon screening a
panel of STR loci on samples of escaped salmon that
are recaptured in the wild in addition to salmon collected from farms in the surrounding area that are considered as potential sources of the escapees. A
combination of genetic assignment in addition to probability based exclusion is used to identify the most likely
source(s) of origin for the escapees.
The data set chosen for analysis in the present study
consisted of approximately 500 Atlantic salmon resulting from investigating an unreported escapement episode. Fish were sampled from nine cages located on six
marine farms (hereon referred to as samples A-I), in
addition to 50 farmed escapees (RF) that had been
recaptured in the vicinity of these farms. The recaptured
fish were distinguished as farmed salmon based upon
morphological characteristics. The farms, locations and
exact dates of collection remain anonymous for legal
reasons.
STR analysis

DNA extraction and STR analysis was performed at the
Institute of Marine Research (IMR) in Bergen. DNA
extraction was carried out in 96 well format using a
Qiagen DNAeasy kit according to the manufacturers’
instructions. Each plate contained a minimum of two
negative controls. DNA was extracted twice for 48 of
the 50 escapees (separate dates). The following fifteen
STR loci were amplified in three separate multiplex PCR
reactions; SSsp3016 (Genbank no. AY372820), SSsp2210,
SSspG7, SSsp2201, SSsp1605, SSsp2216 [31], Ssa197,
Ssa171, Ssa202 [32], SsaD157, SsaD486, SsaD144 [33],
Ssa289, Ssa14 [34], SsaF43 [35], using a modification of
a previously described protocol [36]. These loci are routinely used for performing Atlantic salmon genetics studies at IMR but do not represent an optimised set of
loci for performing genetic assignment of farmed escapees. Locus SsaD486 was monomorphic in the entire
data set and was excluded from all statistical analyses.
PCR products were analysed on an ABI 3730 Genetic
Analyser using the 500 LIZ™ size-standard. Alleles were
automatically binned and manually checked in the Genotyper software prior to data analysis. A total of 87 individuals (from individual samples displaying partial PCR
amplification failure on first amplification/electrophoresis) in addition to 48 of the 50 escapees were re-analysed (pcr amplification then electrophoresis). These
individuals served as a genotyping controls. Several
authors [6,37] have recommended the routine use of
genotyping controls in genetic data sets to estimate
error rates.
SNP screening

SNP genotyping was performed using the MassARRAY
platform from Sequenom (San Diego, USA). A total of

Glover et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/2

388 SNPs were included in the study. Map position and
flanking sequence of the majority of these SNPs are
from Moen et al. [2] and Lorenz et al. [38] (Additional
file 1). Multiplexes and primer sequences for genotyping
are available upon request. All SNP genotyping was performed according to the iPLEX protocol (available at
http://www.sequenom.com) using the MassARRAY™
Analyzer (Autoflex mass spectrometer) from Sequenom.
Genotypes were assigned in real time [39] by using the
MassARRAY SpectroTYPER RT v3.4 software followed
by manual inspection of genotypes using the MassARRAY TyperAnalyzer v3.3 software.
Statistical analysis

In order to compare the two classes of markers, the STR
and SNP data sets were mixed in various combinations.
These are described in the results section as some combinations were test specific. However, the following four
data sets were used as the start point for the majority of
the analyses within: 1) 14 STR loci, 2) 300 SNP loci, 3)
28 SNP loci (selecting the SNP displaying the highest
global FST for each of the 28 linkage groups), and 4) 195
mapped SNPs with minimal distance of > 1 cM to nearest SNP (selecting the SNP displaying the highest global
FST for 2 or more SNPs < 1 cM). For some tests, loci
were ranked prior to computation. Ranking of loci was
carried out by three methods including number of
alleles displayed through samples A-I (STR loci only),
global FST across samples A-I (STR and SNP loci), and
with the locus assignment power program BELS across
samples A-I [40]. BELS was programmed to maximise
mean individual assignment power on the data set without any re-sampling.
Allelic variation, heterozygosity and F statistics were
computed in the program MSA [41]. Arlequin V3.11
[42] was used to calculate deviation from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. MEGA [43] was used to produce phylogenetic trees for the various data sets using the
UPGMA method on matrices of pair-wise FST values.
The trees were linearised assuming equal evolutionary
rates in all lineages [44]. Geneclass V. 1.02 [45] was
used to perform self-assignment simulations among
samples A-I using the leave one out sub-option, and
direct assignment of the escapees to these samples. All
tests were performed using the Rannala and Mountain
[46] method of estimating allele frequencies unless
otherwise stated.
Bayesian clustering analysis implemented in STRUCTURE 2.2 [47,48] was used for estimating the number
of populations/groups (k) represented by the data set.
Following pilot analysis, main runs assuming k = 1-6,
each with 3-5 iterations (depending upon data set), were
conducted in order to estimate the most likely k and to
assign individuals to these groups without using prior

Page 3 of 12

information about their sample of origin using correlated allele frequencies and an admixture model. Each
run consisted of a burn-in of 100,000 MCMC steps, followed by 500,000 replications. STRUCTURE 2.2 was
also used to perform a modified self-assignment procedure by removing 10 individual salmon at random from
samples A, D, F and G, then assigning these individuals
to the baseline which did not include those individuals.
This was conducted by using the prior population information for the baseline samples and no prior population
information for these 40 individuals. The results
obtained from this analysis were compared to an identical procedure in Geneclass for these 40 individuals (in
the latter case removing the 40 fish from the baseline
file and entering them into a separate file of “unknown”
individuals).

Results
Genotyping quality

DNA was isolated from a total of 512 salmon that were
analysed for 15 STR loci at IMR and 388 SNP loci at
CIGENE. In the two laboratories, 13 and 14 of the individual DNA extracts failed to yield PCR products for
any of the loci, leaving STR and SNP data sets consisting of 499 and 498 individual fish respectively. Individuals failing to yield PCR products for the STR loci
were spread among samples, whereas all complete
amplification failures in the SNP data set were observed
within the sample of escapees.
Within the STR data set, a total of 87 individuals displaying PCR failure in ≥ 2 loci were selected for reamplification for all STR loci in order to increase the
scoring percentage in the data set. These individuals
represented the majority of, but not all the individuals
displaying PCR failure at ≥ 2 loci. As a result of re-analysing these 87 individuals, in addition to analysis of the
second DNA isolate for 48 of the 50 escapees, > 1000
genotypes in 135 fish were independently scored on two
occasions. Of these, no genotyping inconsistencies were
observed between original and re-analysis. The resultant
overall genotyping success in the STR data set (n = 499
× 15 markers) was > 99% (Additional file 1).
Within the SNP data set consisting of 388 loci × 498
individuals, amplification of individual loci was highly
variable, ranging from 0-100% scoring (Additional file
1). Loci displaying less than 95% amplification in the
data set were excluded (n = 79). Of the remaining 309
loci analysed for 498 fish, overall genotyping success
was > 98%, whereas genotyping success ranged from
66%-100% for loci across individual fish. Nine of the 309
loci were monomorphic in all samples. These loci were
excluded from all further analyses, leaving a complete
SNP data set of 300 polymorphic loci.

Within-sample variation

Among sample genetic differentiation

Within the SNP data set, 104 out of 2706 tests of HWE
were significant at a = 0.05 (= 3.8%). A total of 294
tests were not computed due to some loci being monomorphic in some samples. Following application of Bonferroni correction in a conservative manner (a = 0.05/
300 loci = 0.00017), only 6 of the observed deviations
remained significant. These were observed in (locus:
sample) 74:A, 202:E, 202:F, 202:G, 207:D, 300:C. Within
the STR data set, 16 out of 140 tests of HWE were significant at a = 0.05 (11.4%). These deviations were
spread among loci and samples, with all being implicated in a minimum of one significant deviation except
loci Ssa289, SsaF43, SSspG7, and samples E, F. Following application of Bonferroni correction in a conservative manner (a = 0.05/14 = 0.0036), none of these
deviations remained significant.
A summary of the allelic variation and expected average heterozygosity per sample are presented (Table 1).
In total, 600 alleles were observed at the 300 SNP loci
whilst 179 alleles were observed at the 14 STR loci. The
percentage of the total number of alleles observed
within specific samples varied between 92-98% and 5374% for the SNP and STR data sets respectively. Despite
large differences in absolute numbers of alleles between
marker sets, corroboration between allelic variation for
individual samples (relative to other samples) was
observed between marker classes. Expected heterozygosity averaged over loci and samples varied greatly
between the 300 SNP data set (He = 0.32) and the 14
STR loci (He = 0.78), although expected heterozygosity,
relative to the other samples was similar between marker classes.

Global F ST values per locus ranged from 0.033-0.115
among the 14 STR loci, and -0.002-0.316 among the
300 SNP loci (Figure 1). 87 of the 300 SNP loci (= 29%)
displayed global FST values over 0.1 whereas two STR
loci (SsaD157 and SSsp2210) exceeded a global FST of
0.1 (= 14%). Despite the considerable differences in FST
among the SNP loci, an analysis using the Bayesian
simulation-based test by Foll and Gaggiotti [49] only
identified a single SNP as an outlier (Bayesian p < 0.01;
data not shown). Hence, there was limited evidence to
suggest that the loci might be under diversifying selection in the analysed set of samples.
Within each linkage group, global FST per SNP locus
varied greatly (Additional file 2). For example, global
F ST ranged between 0.013-0.316 per locus on linkage
group d03. Eleven of the linkage groups consisted of 10
or more SNP loci. When mean global FST per linkage
group was compared among them, no significant differences were observed (Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric

ANOVA: P = 0.12). Analysis with a parametric ANOVA
gave a similar result (P = 0.4). The majority of tightly
linked loci (i.e., those located within the same contig
and < 0.1 cM distance) displayed very similar global FST
values to each other, however, this was not universally
true. For example, whilst the three loci located at 13.7
cM on linkage group d02 displayed global FST values of
0.026-0.034, and the two loci located at 3 cM on linkage
group d14 displayed global F ST values of 0.0002 and
0.0003, the two loci located at 61.8 cM on linkage group
d06 displayed highly contrasting global FST values of
0.05 and 0.27.
The genetic relationships between the nine samples
collected from farms are presented as UPGMA diagrams
(Figure 2). The data set consisting of one SNP per linkage group, selected by highest global F ST , displayed
greater among-sample differentiation than other data
sets, however, among sample relationships were remarkably similar for all data sets (Figure 2), including those
consisting of all 314 markers combined and 195 mapped
SNPs (data not presented).
Self-assignment simulations

Using Geneclass, the overall accuracy of self-assignment
was 65%, 73% and 73% for the data sets consisting of 14
STR, 300 SNPs and 195 mapped SNPs respectively (Figures 3 and 4). In the STR data set, with the exception of
selecting loci starting with the least polymorphic first,
the various selection methods only gave small differences in increase of assignment with number of loci
(Figure 3), and, almost no further gain in assignment
was observed past four loci. In the 300 SNP data set,
large differences in the cumulative assignment curve
were observed between the different selection methods
(Figure 4), furthermore, selection of loci from the 195
mapped SNPs gave the highest overall assignment when
approximately 100 loci were included in the analysis
(80% assignment). Past this number of loci, the assignment accuracy dropped. Comparing the two marker
types, the “best” 15 SNPs selected by BELS matched the
level of assignment achieved by the best 4 STR loci
selected by allelic variation (and BELS).
When self-assignment simulations were conducted
with the SNP loci displaying the highest global FST per
linkage group (n = 28), overall assignment reached 58%
which is similar to the value reported for the best 25
SNP loci selected by global FST irrespective of linkage
group. However, as the SNP loci displaying highest global F ST values were spread between linkage groups
(Additional file 1), these two sets displayed considerable
locus overlap.
Addition of 1-4 STR loci increased assignment for
data sets starting with 5, 10 and 25 SNPs selected by
BELS, however, for the data set starting with 50 SNPs,

Page 5 of 12

addition of STR loci lead to a reduction in assignment
(Figure 5). When selecting SNP loci based upon global
FST, addition of 1-4 STR loci increased assignment in
data set starting with up to 100 loci, although a drop in
overall assignment was observed when starting with 300
SNP loci (data not presented). For all data sets starting
with different numbers of STR loci, addition of up to 50
SNP loci increased assignment when selecting loci with
BELS (Figure 6), and global FST (data not presented).
“Self-assignment” of the 40 individuals removed from
the baseline (10 from A, D, F, G) revealed identical
results between the programs Geneclass and STRUCTURE for data sets consisting of 28 SNPs (58%), and
195 SNPs (78%). The latter is an important as STRUCTURE used a marker linkage model, taking marker distance into the computations, whereas Geneclass treated
the loci as independent. STRUCTURE outperformed
Geneclass for self-assignment of these 40 individuals
using 14 STR loci (73% contra 65%), and all 300 SNPs
(88% contra 80%).
The absolute accuracy of assignment was lower when
computed using a distance based calculation [50], however, the trends in assignment when mixing marker
classes were very similar to the trends reported above,
although no drop in assignment was observed when
STR loci were added to the data set starting with 50
SNP loci.
Assignment of the escapees

Direct assignment (Table 2) using all variants of the
STR and SNP data sets (including all combinations)
demonstrated that nearly all of the escapees originated
from sample I. Whilst only a low number of loci were
required to directly assign most of the escapees to the
sample I, simulations of exclusion from each sample
rejecting at P = 0.01 indicated that more loci were
required for exclusion of the alternative samples, and,
this trend was evident for both marker classes and marker selection criteria (data not presented).
Bayesian clustering of the data set

For the data sets consisting of 14 STR, 28 SNP, 195 SNP
and 300 SNP loci, k was estimated at 4 or 5 (data not
presented), and consequently, assignment of the individuals is presented for k = 3-5 (Additional file 3). The
inter-sample relationships revealed by STRUCTURE 2.2
displayed concordance with the UPGMA diagrams for
these data sets (Figure 2), furthermore, with minor differences, all four data sets examined displayed a similar
pattern of relationships between samples, for each k.
These analyses clearly linked the escapees (RF) and sample I into a single cluster separate from all other samples, confirming the assignment results conducted
above.

SNP loci were selected by highest global FST whereas STRs were selected by number of alleles. 28 unlinked SNPs = highest global FST for each of the linkage
groups. 195 mapped SNPs only includes SNPs > 1 cM distance from next SNP. Different total numbers of escapees in the different data sets is due to differences
in numbers of individuals genotyped.

Discussion
Comparisons between marker classes to perform genetic
assignment can be conducted in a number of ways,
although locus by locus, total number of alleles, or cost
per information unit comparisons are commonly
applied. In this study, it took 15 of the best SNP loci
(total 30 alleles) to match the accuracy of self-assignment achieved by the four most polymorphic STR loci
(83 alleles), clearly demonstrating that although some of
the STR loci out-performed the SNP loci on a single
locus basis, combinations of SNPs outperformed the
STRs based upon total number of alleles. The latter
observation is consistent with a recent comparison
between the two marker classes in chum salmon (Onchorhynchus keta) [16]. Whilst the number of alleles displayed by a locus may be a good predictor of its
individual assignment power [20,21,36], a trend that is
also evident between marker classes when choosing loci
randomly [19], the selection of highly diagnostic SNPs
from larger panels has the ability to increase assignment
considerably, as has been demonstrated in large human
panels [8], and in the present study. Whilst it can be
argued that the principle of selecting highly diagnostic
loci from larger panels can also be applied to any class
of marker, the continued technological advances in SNP
detection genotyping platforms will favor this strategy
for SNP markers.
The drop in accuracy of self-assignment conducted for
the entire data set in Geneclass when adding 100-195
SNP loci based upon selection by BELS (Figure 4) represents a striking result. It is acknowledged that the peak
in this curve may be “inflated” due to a combination of
the fact that identification of loci was conducted without
re-sampling the raw data in BELS, and, that the same
individuals were used for locus identification and selfassignment. Consequently, the peak in this specific

curve should be viewed with caution. Whilst it could be
argued that identification of informative loci could have
been performed using examination and test sub-data
sets by dividing each baseline sample into two components, it is suggested that this would have nevertheless
identified a very similar set of loci. Furthermore, the
marker identification and self-assignment test design
was chosen to examine potential gains in genetic assignment through loci selection as opposed to validate a
universally applicable set of loci that would be valid for
a wide range of other studies. Most importantly however, all combinations of SNP and STR markers identified sample I, which was not included in the marker
identification process, as the source of the unknown
escaped salmon (RF).
Although the drop in self-assignment observed over
100 SNP loci may have been linked to the conditions
presented above, it is also suggested that this may be
due to the inclusion of weakly and/or non-informative
loci, and the manner in which Geneclass deals with
such (large numbers) data. This idea is supported by the
fact that no increase in self-assignment was observed
from 195 to 300 loci (which did not include any locus
ranking in BELS) when assigning the 40 individuals
removed from the baseline with Geneclass (195 to 300
SNP loci = 78% to 80%), which contrasts with the fact
that a large increase was observed using STRUCTURE
(195 to 300 SNP loci = 78% to 88%). Clearly, STRUCTURE was able to utilise data from addition of extra
loci whereas Geneclass was not. This may be linked
with the different computation methods implemented in
the programs, and therefore, this topic requires further
investigation.
The ability for loci to perform individual genetic
assignment can be evaluated by a number of criteria
and programs, for example various distance based methods (e.g., [15], informativeness for assignment (In) [19]

Glover et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/2

and modifications of it [8]. Whilst it was not the intention of the present study to present an exhaustive comparison between various locus selection methods, the
efficacy of the program BELS compared to distance
based methods was clearly demonstrated. However,
whilst identifying the best loci from all 300 SNPs (data
not presented), BELS identified a non-optimal reduced
set of loci compared to the selection carried out with
195 loci only. BELS uses a backwards locus selection
algorithm (see [40]), and it is suggested that as exclusion
of any single locus in the 300 loci data set would not
lead to any clear change in self-assignment accuracy, the
program was unable to identify the best loci when starting with such large numbers. This effect potentially
existed for 195 loci also, and it cannot be excluded that
a more diagnostic set of 50 or 100 loci would have been
identified if one had started with the 100 loci displaying
highest global FST as opposed to the 195 loci. Therefore,
use of the program BELS to identify a reduced panel of
informative markers from a very large set of loci (several
hundred or more) should be conducted with caution.
With the exception of the 28 unlinked SNP data set
which overinflated the differences observed between
samples (Figure 2), varying the number of SNPs and
STRs included in the analyses, and the criteria upon
which the loci were selected, had little influence on the
overall genetic relationships among the samples, as illustrated by UPGMA diagrams (Figure 3) and Bayesian
clustering of the data (additional file 3). Whilst these
comparisons were by no means exhaustive, they illustrate that selection of loci displaying very high global
FST values represents a way to create a better discrimination between pairs of populations. For population
geneticists who are interested in highly discriminatory
genetic markers, the approach described here, by taking
those markers displaying highest FST values may provide
a way to differentiate very similar populations, as is
often the case for marine organisms where there is a
large degree of gene flow and little differentiation.
Most statistical tests have conditions which need to be
fulfilled in order to avoid violation of the underlying
principles. Some of the data sets investigated in the present study, for example analysis of all 300 SNPs combined, violated some of the tests performed. The 300
SNP data set for example, included a number of markers which were tightly linked, i.e., came from the same
contig. For both the individual assignments tests, and
the genetic relationships among the samples however,
the violations incurred in the present study did not
appear to have any effect on the results of these tests,
and gave more or less identical results to the data sets
tested which did not violate the tests (such as the 14
STRs, 28 unlinked SNPs or 195 mapped SNPs with
minimum of 1 cM distance between loci). Whilst

deliberate violations of tests is not recommended, here,
we computed these tests in order extract the maximum
amount of information from the SNP data set as possible. However, the simulations also indicate that moderate violation of the underlying principles of genetic
assignment and phylogeny may not lead to erroneous
results. In a test of individual assignment, Narum et al.,
[15] also reported that minor violations of some of the
test-conditions did not affect the results. Furthermore,
in a comparison of genetic assignment using nonrecombining part of the Y-chromosome, treating the
data as both haplotype and multiple independent loci,
which seriously violates the principles of the tests
[51,52] almost no difference in assignment were
observed.
Individual genetic assignment is based upon matching
or excluding an individual’s multilocus composite genotype to the group genetic profiles of potential source
populations. A number of statistical methods to test this
exist (reviewed by [53,54]). However, for some applications, such as where all potential source populations
may not have been sampled, and forensics, a statistical
test of the “similarity” is required. Data from this study
indicate that whilst only a low number of SNP, STR or
combined SNP and STR loci were required to effectively
identify baseline sample I as the major source for the
unknown individuals, in order to reject other baseline
samples as potential sources for individual escapees, a
larger number of loci were required (data not
presented).

Conclusion
Results of this study demonstrate that the identification
of a highly informative set of SNPs from a larger panel
gave significantly more accurate individual genetic selfassignment compared to any combination of STR loci.
Furthermore, once a set of 50 or more diagnostic SNP
loci were included in the self-assignment analyses, addition of even the most informative STR loci did not
increase the accuracy of self-assignment, whilst addition
of informative SNPs to any combination of STR loci
increased self-assignment. These results clearly demonstrate that identification of highly informative SNP markers from the screening of larger pools represents a
powerful approach to create molecular tools to study
individual ancestry.
