Abstract
Background: The ability for serially homologous structures to acquire a separate identity has been primarily
investigated for structures dependent on Hox gene input but is still incompletely understood in other systems.
The fore and hindwings of butterflies are serially homologous structures as are the serially homologous eyespots
that can decorate each of these wings. Eyespots can vary in number between fore and hindwings of the same
individual and mutations of large effect can control the total number of eyespots that each of the wings displays.
Here we investigate the genetics of a new spontaneous color pattern mutation, Missing, that alters eyespot
number in the nymphalid butterfly, Bicyclus anynana. We further test the interaction of Missing with a previously
described mutation, Spotty, describe the developmental stage affected by Missing, and test whether Missing is a
mutant variant of the gene Distal-less via a linkage association study.
Results: Missing removes or greatly reduces the size of two of the hindwing eyespots from the row of seven
eyespots, with no detectable effect on the rest of the wing pattern. Offspring carrying a single Missing allele display
intermediate sized eyespots at these positions. Spotty has the opposite effect of Missing, i.e., it introduces two
extra eyespots in homologous wing positions to those affected by Missing, but on the forewing. When Missing is
combined with Spotty the size of the two forewing eyespots decreases but the size of the hindwing spots stays
the same, suggesting that these two mutations have a combined effect on the forewing such that Missing reduces
eyespot size when in the presence of a Spotty mutant allele, but that Spotty has no effect on the hindwing. Missing
prevents the complete differentiation of two of the eyespot foci on the hindwing. We found no evidence for any
linkage between the Distal-less and Missing genes.
Conclusion: The spontaneous mutation Missing controls the differentiation of the signaling centers of a subset
of the serial homologous eyespots present on both the fore and the hindwing in a dose-dependent fashion. The
effect of Missing on the forewing, however, is only observed when the mutation Spotty introduces additional
eyespots on this wing. Spotty, on the other hand, controls the differentiation of eyespot centers only on the
forewing. Spotty, unlike Missing, may be under Ubx gene regulation, since it affects a subset of eyespots on only
one of the serially homologous wings.

Background
Modularity of body plans, and of serially repeated structures is widespread in the animal kingdom [1]. Examples
of modular structures include vertebrae [2], teeth [3],
limbs [4], digits [5], arthropod body segments [6], C. elegans terminal rays [7], insect fore and hindwings [8-10],
and butterfly eyespot patterns [11-13]. One of the key
questions driving research in the field of modularity is to
understand how such modules acquire the ability to differentiate into more or less distinct structures [14-16].
This differentiation and specialization of repeated body
parts has, in the case of arthropod's body segments,
increased through evolutionary time [17] presumably
facilitating the radiation of these organisms into different
environments.
The two pairs of wings on a butterfly are serially repeated
structures, as are several of the pattern elements present
within each wing [18]. Pattern elements such as eyespots,
for instance, can occur in each of the wing subdivisions,
the wing cells, delineated by veins. Nijhout [18] proposed
that the diversity of butterfly color patterns seen today
results from the presence or absence, or through the modification of the size, shape, color or position of these serially homologous pattern elements within each wing cell.
While the Hox gene, Ultrabithorax (Ubx), appears to be
responsible for allowing the hindwing to acquire different
wing patterns from the forewing [8], the genes and mechanisms by which particular serially homologous elements
within each wing can acquire a separate identity from the
other elements, however, are still unknown. Here we analyze the phenotypic effects of two spontaneous mutations,
Missing and Spotty that affect the development of two serially homologous eyespots independently of the remaining eyespots on the wings.
The nymphalid butterfly Bicyclus anynana normally displays two marginal eyespots on both the dorsal and ventral sides of the forewing and seven eyespots on the
ventral hindwing. Spontaneous [19,20] and X-ray
induced mutations [12] can alter the number of eyespots
that appear on the wings surfaces, producing substantial
departures from the wild type pattern. The spontaneous
mutation Spotty was previously shown to be a single segregating factor of codominant effect [21]. Spotty homozygotes have two extra eyespots on both the ventral and
dorsal surfaces on the forewings of B. anynana. These extra
eyespots occur in wing cells between those carrying the
wildtype anterior and posterior eyespots. Spotty heterozygotes have either reduced sizes for both extra eyespots, or
have one of the eyespots missing and the other eyespot
present but reduced in size. This mutation, despite only
having been analyzed in a qualitative fashion, appears to
show a very localized effect in controlling the eyespot
developmental program in a subset of the wing cells. Miss-

ing is a new spontaneous mutation that has a very similar
phenotype to another x-ray induced mutation, 3+4, previously described [12]. Contrary to Spotty, this mutation
removes two eyespots from the hindwing, but the wing
cells affected by Missing are homologous to those affected
by Spotty on the forewing.
Here we investigate the phenotypic effects of Missing when
crossed with either Missing, wildtype, or Spotty in order to
describe the mutation in homozygote and in heterozygote
condition and also to investigate whether Missing and
Spotty, which when in isolation only seem to affect the
hindwing or forewing pattern, respectively, show any
interaction when placed together in the same individual.
We additionally test whether during the imaginal disc
stage the Distal-less and Engrailed transcription factors are
absent from the centers of the hindwing eyespots that
don't develop in adults of the Missing stock. We select one
of these genes, Distal-less, as a possible target of the Missing
mutation, and test whether this candidate gene is associated to the Missing phenotype by means of a linkage association study.

Results
Extreme missing individuals have low fitness
Missing individuals show considerable variation in their
phenotype, even after intensive selection for a pure
homozygote stock. This variation is represented by the
presence of very small dots marking the center of the
hindwing eyespots, in wing cells 3 and 4, in a large proportion of the individuals. For our crosses we selected
mostly extreme looking individuals, but sometimes
included individuals that displayed a differentiated but
tiny eyespot pupil, and sometimes a very narrow gold
ring. When no black scales were visible, but a pupil was
clearly differentiated, the diameter of the eyespot was
given as the diameter of the white pupil. We observed that
families whose parents had an extreme "Missing" phenotype produced few offspring, compared to families where
the average size of eyespots 3 and 4 in the parents was less
extreme (Figure 1). After surveying the distribution of eyespot sizes in the offspring we decided that some of the
putative "Missing × Missing" crosses were probably
crosses between Missing/Missing and Missing/Wildtype heterozygotes and excluded them from future comparisons.
In practice, this meant that we applied a threshold of 0.3
mm to the maximal size that each of the two hindwing
eyespots can display in order for that individual to be
called a Missing phenotype. It is also likely that other
modifier loci are contributing to additional variation in
the size of the eyespots targeted by Missing and possibly
also contributing to variation in fitness.

codominant effect relative to Wildtype as well as a localized effect on the hindwing.
When Missing/Wildtype individuals were backcrossed to
Missing there appeared to be a bi-modal distribution of
phenotypes, especially pronounced in one of the largest
families (Figure 3, F52). There appears to be, however,
fewer offspring under the first peak of the bi-modal distributions. This may relate to the fact that several extreme
Missing/Missing genotypes may have not survived to adulthood. In all, these results suggest that the Missing mutation(s) is likely segregating at a single major genetic locus.

of variation explained by the regression line (R2) is 0.24 and
its slope is significantly different form zero (P = 0.028).
The effect of Missing on the hindwing
Crosses of Missing with Missing (Figure 2) produced offspring that displayed some variation in their hindwing
phenotype, but overall displayed reduced or absent eyespots at positions 3 and 4. Hybrids resulting from crosses
of Missing with Wildtype produced intermediate sized
eyespots 3 and 4 relative to those from
Wildtype*Wildtype and Missing × Missing eyespots (Figure 2). Analysis of variance for the size of each of the hindwing eyespots among the three types of cross mentioned
above showed that the effect of Missing is localized to
positions 3 and 4 on the hindwing (Table 1). Sex and family are also factors that explain a significant proportion of
the variance in the data (Table 1). This mutation has a

The effect of Spotty on the forewing
The effect of the Spotty mutation on the forewing was previously described by Brakefield and French [21], who concluded that this mutant had a codominant effect relative
to Wildtype. Spotty homozygotes display two well-developed eyespots in positions 3 and 4 on the forewing, and
heterozygotes display two intermediate sized eyespots at
these positions, or sometimes a single smaller eyespot at
either position 3 or position 4.
The effect of Missing on the forewing
Wildtype individuals normally do not display eyespots in
positions 3 and 4 on the forewing (not shown). Missing*Missing and Missing*Wildtype crosses also did not
display eyespots at these positions (Fig. 4).

eyespots 3 and 4 are smaller in Missing × Spotty offspring
relative to Wildtype × Spotty offspring (Figure 4; Table 3).
There was no difference in the size of the flanking eyespots
(eyespots 2 and 5) in these two types of cross (Table 3).
These results indicate that Missing has the effect of reducing the size of eyespots 3 and 4 on both hindwings and
forewings.

When the effect of Spotty was analyzed on the hindwing,
by comparing eyespot sizes from Spotty × Missing versus
Wildtype × Missing offspring (Figure 2), there was no significant effect of cross-type detected for any of the eyespots (Table 4). To be able to have more power in
detecting the effect of Spotty on the hindwing, we also
investigated whether the effect of the Spotty allele, in
Spotty × Wildtype and Spotty × Missing offspring combined, resulted in larger hindwing eyespot sizes relative to
the Wildtype allele in Wildtype × Wildtype, or Wildtype ×
Missing offspring combined. Despite the larger sample
size (n = 803), there was still no detectable significant
effect of Spotty in increasing hindwing eyespot size (data
not shown).
Immunohistochemistry
Late larval hindwing discs of individuals taken from the
Missing stock displayed a range of Distal-less and engrailed
expression patterns in the 3rd and 4th wing cells, from the
absence of both these proteins in the future eyespot centers (Figure 5), to the presence of small differentiated foci,
expressing both proteins (not shown). The expression of
Distal-less along the intervenous stripes was present in all
hindwing cells.

the F1 male had a similar genotype as the Missing grandmother, and was not cut by the restriction enzyme.
We tested two hypotheses: 1) If the Dll polymorphism is
linked to the Missing mutation then we expect to find the
majority of backcross individuals with the smallest or
with absent eyespots to be homozygote for the CCAAGT
genotype and display the "no-cut" pattern; and the majority of the individuals with the largest eyespots to display
the "heterozygote-cut" restriction pattern on the gel. 2)
On the other hand if the Dll polymorphism is not linked
to the Missing mutation then we expect approximately
50% of backcross individuals with the smallest eyespots
to have the "no-cut" pattern, and 50% to have the "heterozygote-cut" pattern. The same frequencies will be
expected for the individuals with the largest eyespots.

Association study
We identified an informative SNP (C/A) in a recognition
sequence for the BseNI restriction enzyme (NCCAGT) in
the Dll 5'UTR fragment analyzed for the four grandparents. The wildtype grandparent was homozygous
CCCAGT and the BseNI enzyme cut the amplified PCR
fragment into two fragments, 451 bp and 239 bp long,
respectively. The Missing grandparent was homozygous
CCAAGT and thus was not cut by the BseNI enzyme. The
F1 male parent was an expected heterozygote (CCCAGT/
CCAAGT) and had the expected heterozygote restriction
pattern; whereas the Missing female that was crossed with

From the 15 individuals that were genotyped with the
smallest eyespots (0.06 mm average diameter ± 0.02 mm
SE) we obtained 7 individuals (2 females and 5 males)
that were not cut by the enzyme, and 8 individuals (4
females and 4 males) that were cut by the enzyme. From
the 15 individuals that were genotyped with the largest
eyespots (0.51 mm average diameter ± 0.03 mm SE), 10
individuals (2 females and 8 males) were not cut by the
enzyme, and 5 individuals (3 females and 2 males) were
cut by the enzyme. These results clearly support the hypothesis of no linkage between Dll and Missing genes.

Discussion
The series of crosses clearly show that Missing, is a co-dominant mutation that has the dramatic effect of removing or
reducing the size of two eyespots on the hindwing when
in homozygote and heterozygote condition, respectively.
Missing has the additional effect of reducing the size of the
eyespots present in a homologous position on the forewing. The subtle effect of the Missing mutation on the
forewing is not easily observed by eye and was only borne
out because of the detailed quantitative approach used
here. Spotty, on the other hand, is a mutation that intro-

duces two eyespots on the forewing, and has no effect on
the size of the homologous eyespots on the hindwing.
Selector genes such as Ubx, that are expressed only on the
hindwings of insects, including butterflies, have been
shown to affect the size of eyespots on the hindwing relative to their homologous counterparts on the forewing
[8][22]. Ubx-dependent eyespot size changes in the butterfly Junonia (Precis) coenia involve quantitative changes
both in the signaling component as well as in the
response components of the eyespot differentiation
mechanism [8]. From our analysis it appears that the qualitative effect of the Spotty allele on eyespot number is also
regulated in a Hox gene-dependent fashion. Spotty is selectively expressed in the forewing, but not in the hindwing,
indicating that a putative hindwing repressor (such as
Ubx) modulates the effect of this allele. On the other
hand, the Missing allele appears to exert its action on the
eyespot developmental program in a Ubx gene-independent fashion. Missing will affect the size of homologous
eyespots in both forewing and hindwings simultaneously.

age status of the Missing and Spotty genes. If the distributions had a clear two-peaked shape, this would indicate
likely linkage, and the presence of two main genotypic
classes (M/S and M/M for backcrosses to Missing for
instance). If, on the other hand, the distributions were
more normally distributed, i.e, reflecting the sum of four
normal distributions, each representing a genotypic class,
centered around different mean values (M/M, +/+; M/M,
S/+; +/M, +/+; and +/M, S/+), then this would indicate
that Missing and Spotty were found either on different linkage groups, or in the same linkage group but far apart.
Unfortunately, there were two major complications to the
successful completion of these analyses. First, the backcross distribution of Missing/Spotty hybrids crossed to
Missing produced a skewed distribution against the zero
eyespot diameter along the x-axis, where a series of Missing-like individuals were clustered. These skewed distributions cannot be readily analyzed with standard mixture
models. Second, there was a strong family effect in that
while some families produced a strong two-peaked distribution, other families didn't.

It still remains to be determined whether these two mutations are genetically linked, perhaps representing alleles of
the same gene. Crosses performed between Missing and
Spotty individuals, followed by backcrosses to Missing,
Wildype, or Spotty, were performed in order to try and
analyze the shape of the backcross distributions. The
shape of these distributions would indicate the likely link-

The immunohistochemistry showed that the Missing
mutation, similarly to the 3+4 mutation previously
described [12], affects the complete differentiation of the
group of signaling cells at the center of the future eyespots.
The focal cells, marked by the domains of Dll and en
expression, are either a small cluster or do not differentiate at all, and as a result, there is no signaling during the

pupal stage of eyespot differentiation, no visible white
pupil, and no color rings of scales on the adult wing.
Distal-less is known to be one of the first genes to be
expressed in the eyespot pupils during the fifth instar larval wing disc stage [23-25]. In Drosophila, this gene is also
the first gene to be expressed in the future position of the
ventral appendages of the fly. It acts as a selector gene that
works in a fairly context-independent fashion since its
ectopic activation in the leg disk of Drosophila results in a
complete leg duplication [26]. Because of these similarities we decided to test whether a putative mutation in the
regulatory region of this gene may be causing the Missing
phenotype. The association study concluded that the Missing mutation is not linked to Distal-less. Alternative genes
to test would include Notch, also shown to be expressed in
the larval wing disc, in the eyespot foci, and recently
shown to be expressed slightly earlier in development in
these cells relative to Distal-less [23], or other genes
involved in the focus differentiation pathway, but putatively already acting downstream of Dll and Notch
(reviewed in [20,27]). Given that we are looking for a single gene mutation, a more sensible approach to identify
this gene in the future may be to take a positional mapping study, with markers positioned all along the genome,
until a candidate genomic regions is found to be associated with the mutation. Progress in the development of
genomic tools for Bicyclus may allow this to be done in the
near future [28].

Conclusion
We described the phenotypic effects of two mutations that
affect the development of two of the serial homologous
eyespots present in both fore and hindwings of B. anynana. Both mutations have a co-dominant effect relative
to their wild-type alleles. These mutations, however, differ
in the way that they interact with putative selector genes,
previously shown to influence both the signal and the
response components of the eyespot developmental
mechanism in homologous eyespots positioned either on
the fore or on the hindwings. Spotty targets eyespots only
on the forewing and, therefore, may be under Ubx gene
regulation, whereas Missing has a Ubx-gene independent
effect, and reduces the size of eyespots on both fore and
hindwing. Both these mutation are acting quite early in
the eyespot development pathway by affecting the differentiation of the central group of cells, the focus, responsible for early pupal signaling and differentiation of the
concentric rings of colored scales in an eyespot [29,30].
These two mutations highlight the ability of genes of large
effect to affect subsets of serially homologous structures
and give them a separate identity from the rest. It is still
unclear, however, whether the ancestral condition for
these serial homologues is that of separately controlled
units, regulated by genes such as Spotty and Missing that
have very discrete affects on eyespot development brought
together to form a complete row of eyespots, or whether,
on the other hand, eyespots appeared as a cohesive unit of

question.

used as a fixed factor, since males are usually smaller than
females and also have smaller eyespots, and family was
coded as a random factor, nested within cross type. Analyses were done using SPSS version 11 for the Macintosh.
Regression analyses were done in Excel version X for the
Macintosh. Graphics were done is SPSS and in Excel.

Methods

Immunohistochemistry
Late fifth instar larval wings of Missing individuals were
stained according to the protocol described in [32] with
antibodies targeting Distal-less (a gift from Grace
Boekhoff-Falk [33]) and Engrailed (antibody 4F11, a gift
from Nipam Patel [34]).

Crosses
We reared a series of single pair families by placing virgin
adult butterflies in small cubic net hanging cages and followed the crossing scheme outlined in Table 5. In addition, we used data from previously reared single pair
crosses of wildtype with wildtype [12], reared in the same
climate room and in identical conditions to the new
crosses described here. Adults were reared on banana, eggs
were collected on young maize plants, and larvae from
each family were reared in tube-like net cages on maize
plants. All animals were reared inside a climate room at
27°C, 12 h:12 h light:dark photoperiod and 80% relative
humidity. Upon emergence the ventral wing pattern of F1
individuals was photographed with a black and white
video camera and images were saved as Tiff files.

The ventral pattern of forewings and hindwings was quantified by measuring the diameter of the black discs of all
eyespots present on the ventral side of fore and hindwings
along an axis parallel to the wing veins. Diameter measurements were done using the Tiff files in Object Image
1.62 [31]. Data were later transferred to MS Excel version
X.
Statistics
Analyses of variance for eyespot size were performed by
asking whether there was a significant size difference for
any of the forewing or hindwing eyespots (analyzed individually) between offspring from different types of cross
(Missing × Wildtype, Wildtype × Wildtype, etc). Cross
type was used as a fixed factor. For all analyses sex was also

Association study
An additional cross was performed between a Wildtype
male and a Missing female, followed by a backcross of a
single F1 male offspring to another Missing female. The
bodies of these individuals were separated from the
wings, placed in 2 ml screw cap vials filled with 100% ethanol, and stored at -70°C. Hindwings for all the backcross
progeny were photographed, and the diameter of eyespots
at positions 3 and 4 was measured and averaged for each
individual. DNA was extracted from the four parents, and
a 690 bp 5'UTR fragment, from the previously cloned Distal-less (Dll) gene [35] was amplified with the following
two primers: Dll-NF1 (5'-CGCGAGTTGGTTGTGTCGGGTTACCTCGGA-3')
and
Dll-R6
(5'-CGTGGAAACACAGCATCACTATCACA-3').
PCR
amplification conditions were 5 min at 94°, followed by
35 cycles of 40 sec at 94°C, 40 sec at 57°C, and 60 sec at
72°C. The amplification ended with a 5 min final extension period at 72°C. The PCR product was inserted into
pGEM-T vector (Promega) and cloned in E. coli JM109
cells. Five clones were sequenced from each of the four
parents and the sequences were screened for the presence
of an informative polymorphic marker, i.e, a marker with
two alleles and with a different allele, ideally in homozygote condition, present in the Missing and Wildtype

grandparents. This marker should also be easily genotyped by means of an enzymatic essay where homozygote
and heterozygote individuals can be differentiated by
their restriction-digest banding pattern. The backcross
generation was genotyped by first extracting DNA from
the most extreme 15 individuals from each of the two
ends of the eyespot size distribution. The same Dll fragment was amplified via PCR from these individuals, purified using a Quiagen PCR purification column, and then
digested overnight with BseNI (BsrI) restriction enzyme
following the manufacture's directions (Fermentas).
Digested DNA was run on a 1.5% agarose gel, photographed, and the genotype was assayed from the restriction pattern.

Authors' contributions
AM designed and coordinated the experiments, helped
rear the butterflies, collected the immunohistochemistry
data, analyzed the eyespot size data, and wrote the manuscript. BC, assisted by LV, performed the Dll association
study, LS scanned all the wings, performed all the eyespot
measurements, and assisted AM in the eyespot size analyses, JP did most of the butterfly rearing, AB prepared the
butterfly wings for imaging and the bodies for DNA analysis, and PMB helped design the experiments and critically revised the final manuscript.
