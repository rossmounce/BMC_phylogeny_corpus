Abstract
Background: Persistent infection with oncogenic types of human papillomavirus (HPV) is the
major risk factor for invasive cervical cancer (ICC), and non-European variants of HPV-16 are
associated with an increased risk of persistence and ICC. HLA class II polymorphisms are also
associated with genetic susceptibility to ICC. Our aim is to verify if these associations are influenced
by HPV-16 variability.
Methods: We characterized HPV-16 variants by PCR in 107 ICC cases, which were typed for HLADQA1, DRB1 and DQB1 genes and compared to 257 controls. We measured the magnitude of
associations by logistic regression analysis.
Results: European (E), Asian-American (AA) and African (Af) variants were identified. Here we
show that inverse association between DQB1*05 (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.66; 95% confidence
interval [CI]: 0.39–1.12]) and HPV-16 positive ICC in our previous report was mostly attributable
to AA variant carriers (OR = 0.27; 95%CI: 0.10–0.75). We observed similar proportions of HLA
DRB1*1302 carriers in E-P positive cases and controls, but interestingly, this allele was not found
in AA cases (p = 0.03, Fisher exact test). A positive association with DRB1*15 was observed in both
groups of women harboring either E (OR = 2.99; 95% CI: 1.13–7.86) or AA variants (OR = 2.34;
95% CI: 1.00–5.46). There was an inverse association between DRB1*04 and ICC among women
with HPV-16 carrying the 350T [83L] single nucleotide polymorphism in the E6 gene (OR = 0.27;
95% CI: 0.08–0.96). An inverse association between DQB1*05 and cases carrying 350G (83V)
variants was also found (OR = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.15–0.89).
Conclusion: Our results suggest that the association between HLA polymorphism and risk of ICC
might be influenced by the distribution of HPV-16 variants.

Background
Invasive cervical cancer (ICC) is one of the leading causes
of cancer-related death in women in developing countries.
According to the WHO, the age-adjusted incidence rate of
ICC in Brazil is 23.4 per 100,000 women [1], making it
the second most common cancer in Brazilian women. The
major risk factor is persistent infection with oncogenic
types of human papillomavirus (HPV) with the contribution of additional co-factors such as smoking and oral
contraceptive use. A strong association exists between persistent HPV infections and risk of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL), particularly for HPV types 16 and 18 [2].
HPV DNA sequences are found in 2% to 44% of sexuallyactive asymptomatic women [3], but virtually all cervical
carcinomas contain DNA of the high-risk types [4]. However, HPV infection is necessary but not sufficient to cause
the development of ICC.
HPV-16 is the most common type found in ICC and in
healthy women. Investigations of HPV-16 sequence variability worldwide suggest that the virus evolved along five
major phylogenetic branches that largely reflect the ethnicity of the human host populations [5]. Studies from
different populations described that non European variants, mainly from the Asian-American branch, are associated with higher risks of HPV persistence and CIN
development [6], as well as ICC [7]. Different biological
and biochemical properties have already been attributed
to naturally occurring variants of HPV-16 [8-11], and a
differential risk for HPV persistence and ICC was also
associated with some HPV-16 variants [12,13].
The increased rate of HPV related diseases in patients with
cellular immunodeficiency suggests an important role of
the immune response in the control of HPV infection
[14]. Due to the crucial function of HLA class II molecules
on antigen presentation to CD4 T cells, as well as the high
polymorphism of HLA genes, many studies investigated
associations between HLA class II alleles and HPV associated diseases [[15-17], for review see [18]].
A decreased risk of ICC was observed in carriers of
DQB1*05 in our previous case-control study conducted in
a Northeastern Brazilian population [19], and similar
associations were found in studies conducted in the British population [20,21]. Positive associations with HLADRB1*15-DQB1*0602 were reported in Brazilian [19],
British [20] and Swedish women [22], as well as Hispanics
from New Mexico [23]. However, this haplotype was
inversely associated with HPV-16 high-grade SIL (HSIL) in
a study performed in United States [24]. The conflicting
data concerning some of HLA associations among different populations may be influenced by HPV-16 variability,
because variants can be immunologically distinct, since

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/8/246

some sequence changes occur in potential HLA class II
and I epitopes.
Previous studies were conducted to investigate the association between HPV-16 variants and HLA class II polymorphism in different populations. In Japanese women,
DRB1*1501 and DQB1*0602 alleles are associated with
ICC positive for HPV-16 prototype [25]. A study done
with Swedish, Italian and Czech women revealed a trend
for a positive association between carriers of DRB1*04DQB1*03 haplotypes and ICC positive for E6 83V variants [26]. The same amino acid substitution was associated with HLA-DRB1*07 [27] and DR4-DQ3 [28] in
Dutch and Swedish populations, respectively. Conversely,
no associations were found in a British study [20].
To investigate if the association pattern between HLA class
II genes and ICC is dependent on the distribution of HPV16 variants, we evaluated the HPV-16 variability in 107
patients enrolled in a case-control study [19], previously
analyzed for HLA-DRB1, DQB1 and DQA1 polymorphisms.

Methods
Samples
The 107 HPV-16 positive cases and 257 controls included
in the present study were selected from an epidemiological study of ICC and HPV infection previously conducted
in Brazil, whose details have been presented elsewhere
[29,19]. Cases were women with histopathological confirmation of squamous ICC admitted for diagnosis and
treatment at the Napoleão Laureano Hospital, in João Pessoa, Brazil, between 1986 and 1990. Controls were
women with normal or inflammatory Pap smears selected
from a citywide opportunistic screening program carried
out at the same hospital. Written informed consent was
obtained from all patients and controls, and ethical
review committee of the Hospital Napoleão Laureano and
of the Hospital do Cancer A C Camargo/Fundação Antonio Prudente approved the study. Risk factor information
was obtained through a standardized interview carried
out by a trained nurse using a structured questionnaire.
Ethnicity was identified by the nurse according to previously designated categories (white, mulatto and black). A
cervical cell specimen was collected from each control
using a cytobrush, and tumor biopsies were obtained
from all cases. Clinical specimens were prepared and submitted to cytological or histological examination, and the
remaining cells and tissues were stored at -20°C and
shipped in dry ice to the Ludwig Institute for Cancer
Research (São Paulo, Brazil) to DNA extraction. Aliquots
of the purified DNA were used for HPV detection and typing, characterization of HPV-16 variants as well as for HLA
typing.

HPV typing
DNA extraction and HPV detection and typing were performed by standard techniques [29]. Briefly, DNA samples from cases and controls were submitted to PCR-based
amplification of a 450 bp segment in the L1 viral gene
with MY09 and MY11 primers [30]. PCR products were
dot blotted in a Nylon membrane and hybridized with
individual 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes specific for
HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 40, 42, 45, 51–
59, 66, 68, 70, 71, 72, 81, 82, 83 and 89 [31,32].
Characterization of HPV-16 variants
HPV-16 variants were characterized for E6 and L1 genes
by nested PCR, followed by hybridization with oligonucleotide probes [33]. The probes sequences and washing
temperatures were as described by before [33], except the
E6 350G and 403A, washed at 47°C. The hybridization
pattern of each sample with all the probes allows the classification of variants into European (E), Asian-American
(AA), African-1 (Af-1) and African-2 (Af-2) branches, and
two additional subclasses within E and AA branches [34].
Variant designation was done according to previous
report [35].

Some specimens were further characterized by sequencing
analysis of viral gene fragments. L1 PCR products were
cloned using the Sure Clone ligation kit (Amersham Pharmacia, New Jersey, USA) and transformed into E. coli,
strain DH5α. E6 PCR products cloning were done with
TOPO TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) and
transformed into TOP10 Chemically competent E.coli
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). Clones were screened by
PCR with plasmid specific primers, and these PCR products were sequenced using Big-Dye Terminator (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, USA) and one of the primers used
in the PCR. Sequences were analyzed in an ABI3100
sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). To
identify infections by multiple variants, five clones from
each transformation were selected for sequencing analysis. Samples were classified as positive for multiple infections only if clones from different HPV-16 branches were
identified in one gene fragment and confirmed in the
other (E6 and L1).
HLA typing
All the 257 controls and the 112 HPV-16 positive cases
used in this study had been previously typed for HLA class
II genes [19]. Typing was done by PCR-amplification of
the 2nd exon of HLA-DQA1, DQB1 and DRB1 genes, followed by hybridization with sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes [36].
Statistical analysis
To evaluate the differences in the distribution of HLA
group frequencies between cases carrying each HPV-16

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/8/246

variant and controls, odds ratios (OR) and respective 95%
confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. Crude and
age- and ethnicity-adjusted ORs were computed by
unconditional logistic regression, using SPSS statistical
software (version 11.0). In our previous study [19] other
variables (level of education, income, consumption of
alcoholic beverages other than beer or sugar cane distillates) were also controlled for because of their association
with ethnicity. In the interest of precision, however, as
similar estimates were obtained using models based on
both sets of confounders we used only adjustment for age
and ethnicity. All the associations that were analyzed are
reported.

Results
HPV-16 variants from E, AA, Af-1 and Af-2 branches were
identified in 107 cases out of 112 HPV-16 positive ICC
cases, because five samples were not included in variant
analysis due to PCR failure or disagreement between variant identity in E6 and L1 genes. Although we detected 36
HPV positive samples in the control group [19], only 12
were HPV-16 positive. Due to this small number of carriers, we did not characterize HPV-16 variability in the control group. The frequency of cases harboring AA variants
was similar to the frequency of cases with E variants, while
a low proportion of African variants was observed, being
8 of Af-2 branch, and only one Af-1 variant (Table 1). We
identified double infections by variants from different
branches in 15 cases, 13 of which were carriers of AA and
European prototype (E-P) variants, one positive for E-P
and Af-2, and the other one carrying AA and Af-2 variants.
Only one case harbored two different HPV-16 variants of
the same branch, the European. The AAa variant, which
belongs to the AA branch, was the most frequent HPV-16
variant in this series. From the same branch, we identified
one NA-1 variant. The second most common variant was
the E-P, from the E branch. We also identified an E-6994A,
an E-G131T and 4 E-350G variants.
In our previous case-control study performed with these
samples, we have reported that DRB1*15 and the
DRB1*1503-DQB1*0602 haplotype were positively associated with ICC. On the other hand, DRB1*0101 and
DQB1*05 were inversely associated with this disease [19].
As HPV-16 was the most common type found in those
samples, we extended the type-specific analysis and the
most relevant results are shown in Table 2.
To perform the analysis of HLA distribution we first
excluded 33 cases that contained HPV types other than 16,
and then excluded 5 cases that were positive for more than
one HPV-16 variant, as the influence of one variant in
immune response to another is not clear. We therefore
evaluated the HLA distribution in 69 cases, which were
positive for HPV-16 only and had a single variant infec-

these cases is also shown in Table 1.
The comparison of HLA-DQA1, DQB1 and DRB1 alleles'
distribution between controls and cases, which were stratified according to major variants E-P and AA found in this
sample, is presented on Table 3. We observed that the pro-

portion of HLA-DQA1*0101/04 carriers was lower in cases
positive for AA variants than in controls (Table 3). Due to
linkage disequilibrium, this allele is commonly found in
haplotypes with DQB1*05 and DRB1*01 alleles. As
expected, an inverse association between HLA-DQB1*05
and DQB1*0501 carriers was also observed with AA variant cases (Table 3). Interestingly, the allele DRB1*1302

was not found among AA positive cases (p = 0.03, Fisher
exact test), although its frequency was not statistically different between controls and ICC cases positive for E variants (Table 3).
A higher frequency of HLA-DQA1*0102 was found in
cases positive for E variants (adjusted OR = 2.32, 95% CI:
0.96–5.62; Table 3; p = 0.06) than in controls, but not in
those associated with AA variants (Table 3). Although the
DQA1*0102 allele can be found in different DRB1-DQB1
haplotypes, we found it mainly with DRB1*15 and
DQB1*0602 alleles. The association with DRB1*15 was
comparable between European variants (OR = 2.99; 95%
CI: 1.13–7.86; p = 0.03) and AA variants (OR = 2.34; 95%
CI: 1.00–5.46, p = 0.05) (Table 3). In both European and
AA groups, the DRB1*1503 allele had the highest OR values (adjusted OR = 3.75; 95% CI: 0.99–12.42; p = 0.05
and OR = 2.62; 95% CI: 0.83–8.27; p = 0.10, respectively).
DRB1*15 alleles are found in linkage disequilibrium with
DQB1*0602. However, it is worth noting that this allele
was found, in most cases, in linkage with DRB1*15,
whereas in the controls, a larger proportion of
DQB1*0602 was found in linkage with DRB1*11 alleles.

2.34 (1.00–5.46)
2.62 (0.83–8.27)

The only statistically significant result in the comparison
of HLA-DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes in the stratified analysis
was an association between DRB1*15-DQB1*0602 and Evariant cases (p = 0.02, Table 3). Similar to the trends
observed for the distribution of alleles, we found a lower
frequency of the DRB1*0102-DQB1*0501 haplotype in
patients carrying AA variants (adjusted OR = 0.18; 95%
CI: 0.02–1.44; Table 3; p = 0.11) than in E carriers
(adjusted OR = 2.18; CI: 0.75–6.29; Table 3, p = 0.15).
Although the number of African variants was too small to
allow any stratified analysis, it is of relevance that 4 of the
8 Af-2 cases were carriers of DRB1*07-DQB1*02 haplotype (in the control group, this haplotype was identified
in 47 of the 257 controls).

in the E6 viral oncogene could interfere in HLA association with ICC, we stratified cases according to this polymorphism and results of this analysis are on Table 4. The
E6 83V group was composed of cases harbouring AA and
the E-350G variants, while other E variants and Af variants
formed the 83L group. Despite the observed inverse association between DQB1*05 and 83V cases (OR = 0.37; 95%
CI: 0.15–0.89; Table 4, p = 0.03), the proportion of

DQB1*05 carriers in 83L cases was not different from controls. Similar tendencies were also verified for the
DQB1*0501 allele. We also found an inverse association
between DRB1*04 and ICC cases positive for 83L E6 variants (adjusted OR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.08–0.96; Table 4, p =
0.04), which was not observed for patients carrying 83V
E6 variants.
The frequency of DQA1*0102 carriers was higher in cases
carrying 83L E6 variants (OR = 2.24; 95% CI: 0.99–5.09,
p = 0.05) than in controls (Table 4). Increased risks were
also seen for DRB1*15 alleles, particularly DRB1*1503.
However, statistical significance was only unequivocal for
cases with 83L variants (OR = 3.87, 95% CI: 1.20–12.52,
p = 0.02). The analysis of haplotypes revealed a positive
association
between
DRB1*15-DQB1*0602
and
DRB1*1503-DQB1*0602 (OR = 2.86; 95% CI: 1.14–7.16,
p = 0.02 and OR = 3.87; 95% CI: 1.20–12.52, p = 0.02
respectively; Table 4) with 83L carriers. Similar trends
were found for 83V variants but they did not reach statistical significance. Despite the low frequency of the
DRB1*09012-DQB1*0201/02 haplotype in this sample, it
was positively associated with ICC carrying 83L variants
(Table 4).

Discussion
In this report we analyzed the interplay between HPV-16
variants and HLA-DQA1, DQB1 and DRB1 variability on
the susceptibility to ICC in Brazilian women. We found
similar frequencies of European (prototype) and AA HPV16 variants in our group of cases and a lower proportion
of African variants in samples from cervical cancer
patients. In agreement with a previous study by our team
of a different Brazilian population [6], the major European variant found in these samples was the prototype.
Non-European variants are associated with greater risk of
cervical lesions than European ones but results have not
been uniform across populations. Some studies were conducted in European populations [20,27,37] and conflicting results were observed, probably due to the
predominance of lower risk European variants in those
populations [38]. The relatively high proportion of AA
variants in our cases agrees with our previous observation
in asymptomatic Brazilian women that indicate that these
variants are associated with higher risks of HPV persistence and CIN development [6]. A case-control study done
in Mexico also revealed a higher ICC risk among women
carrying AA than E variants [7]. Data obtained from such
admixtured populations in the Americas show a reproducible pattern of risk associated with non-European variants

of HPV-16 [38]. The diverse distribution of HPV variants
between cases and controls from several populations can
reflect differences in their oncogenic potential. It has been
suggested that differences in the LCR sequence might play
a role in HPV-induced tumorigenesis, because nucleotide
changes can alter promoter activity of the viral genome
[39,40]. On the other hand, variations in coding regions,
such as in E6 gene sequences could also explain this
diverse oncogenic potential of variants through differential protein activity [8-11].
Several studies investigated the role of HLA class II genes
and alleles in HPV related diseases. Positive associations
with DRB1*15-DQB1*06 haplotype and inverse associations with HLA-DRB1*13 allele were described in different populations, including Brazilians [19], Americans/
Hispanics [23] and Europeans [20,22]. In some of these
studies, associations with cases harboring HPV-16 have
been suggested: DRB1*0407-DQB1*0302 haplotype was
positively associated with HPV-16 positive cases in Hispanic women [23]. Likewise, we have previously reported
an association of DRB1*1503 with HPV positive ICC,
with higher OR values when only HPV-16 cases were considered [19], but in this report we found similar results
when compared women harboring E and AA variants.
Since associations involving DR*15 alleles were observed
in many populations [20,22,23,41-43], with different
HPV variants, it is reasonable to speculate an effect of this
allele on cervical disease independently of HPV-16 variants distribution.
On the other hand, stratification of cases according to
HPV-16 variants allowed us to find that trends of inverse
associations between HPV-16 cases with DQA1*0101/04
and DQB1*05 [19] are due to AA variants. Previous studies involving populations with few AA variants [26-28]
did not report the association of AA cases with DQB1*05.
Due to the high prevalence of E variants in these studies,
they took into consideration mostly single nucleotide polymorphisms, as in the E6 gene, which generates variants
designated L83V (T to G substitution at 350 nucleotide
position). This substitution was associated with and
increased risk for HPV persistence and ICC [12].
Inverse associations of cervical cancer with DRB1*13
group were found in Costa Rica [44] and Hispanic women
from USA [23]; as well as Swedish [22]; French [45] and
Dutch [42] populations. A trend for negative association
was observed in American women [24], similar to what
we observed previously between DRB1*1302 and ICC
cases [19]. In our present study, the comparison of
DRB1*1302 frequency between controls and European
variants cases did not reveals any association, but, interestingly, this allele was not found in ICC cases positive for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/8/246

AA variants, suggesting a protective role of this allele to
cases carrying AA variants.
We found a lower proportion of women carrying DR4 in
83L cases than in controls, and a similar trend was
observed in the DRB1*04-DQB1*0302 haplotype comparison (data not shown). Interestingly, in a Swedish population, the frequency of DR*04-DQ*03 haplotype was
higher in cases with 83V variant than in controls [28]; and
similar trends were also described for Italian, Czech and
other Swedish populations [26]. A study conducted in the
British population revealed that HPV-16 E2 variants,
which also present the E6 350G (83V), occurred more frequently
in
individuals
with
HLA-DRB1*0401DQB1*0301 and DRB1*1101-DQB1*0301 haplotypes
[46].
The influence of HPV-16 variants in HLA distribution in
ICC cases suggests that variants can differ in their immunogenic potential. Although there are few studies and
most of them restricted to small sample sizes, which limits
the interpretation of some findings, it is possible that the
associations can reflect alterations in the binding of viral
epitopes to HLA molecules. The DR4 alleles found here
are in linkage disequilibrium with DQ3 and it was already
detected that a substitution of a residue in a HSV peptide
impaired its binding to DQ3.2 molecule (allele
DQB1*0302), but this altered peptide become able to
bind to DQ3.1 and DQ3.3 molecules (DQB1*0301 and
*0303 alleles, respectively) [47]. Functional consequences
of alterations in viral proteins were demonstrated in animal models, and a single residue change in E6 protein of
cottontail rabbit papillomavirus progressor strain led to
high frequencies of spontaneous regressions in inbred
rabbits [48]. Variations in E6 protein from AA and E variants differ in peptide positions (14H, 83V) that are
encompassed by the epitopes described earlier [49,50],
but further evaluation is warranted to elucidate a possible
role of these substitutions in immune response.
In our previous report, we did not detect many differences
when comparing HPV negative and positive controls [19].
However, HPV detection was performed in a single point
in time. In our longitudinal study, different haplotypes
were associated with HPV infections and/or persistence
[51], but this study was conducted in a population of a
different region in Brazil, which could reflect differences
in HLA distribution. Bontkes et al. 1998 [27] suggest that
immunogenetic factors associated with disease progression are different from those associated with susceptibility
to HPV-16 infection. However, Beskow et al., 2002 [52]
found a strong correlation between long-term infection
and high viral load and between short-term infection and
low viral load. They described that carriers of DRB1*1501DQB1*0602 haplotype, had higher HPV-16 viral load

than non-carriers [52] and that carriers of protective alleles (DRB1*1301 and DQB1*0603) have lower HPV-18/45
load compared to non carriers [53]. These results suggest
an interaction between viral (as HPV types, variants and
viral load) and host factors, and it is possible that HLA
polymorphism may affect the immune reaction to the
virus and indirectly play a role in the susceptibility to
HPV-related lesions.

Conclusion
Taken together our data suggest that HPV-16 variability
influences the association between HLA polymorphism
and ICC risk. Studies to elucidate its influence in immune
responses to HPV, and its role in viral clearance or progression of HPV-related diseases are warranted.
