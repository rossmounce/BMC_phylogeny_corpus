Abstract
Background: E. sakazakii is considered to be an opportunistic pathogen, implicated in food borne
diseases causing meningitis or enteritis especially in neonates and infants. Cultural standard
identification procedures for E. sakazakii include the observation of yellow pigmentation of colonies
and a positive α glucosidase activity. Up to now, only one PCR system based on a single available
16S rRNA gene sequence has been published for E. sakazakii identification. However, in our hands
a preliminary evaluation of this system to a number of target and non-target strains showed
significant specificity problems of this system. In this study full-length 16S rRNA genes of thirteen
E. sakazakii strains from food, environment and human origin as well as the type strain ATCC
51329 were sequenced. Based on this sequence data a new specific PCR system for E. sakazakii was
developed and evaluated.
Results: By phylogenetic analysis of the new full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence data obtained we
could show the presence of a second phylogenetic distinct lineage within the E. sakazakii species.
The newly developed 16S rRNA gene targeting PCR system allows identification of E. sakazakii
strains from both lineages. The assay's ability to correctly identify different E. sakazakii isolates as
well as to differentiate E. sakazakii from other closely related Enterobacteriaceae species and other
microorganisms was shown on 75 target and non-target strains.
Conclusion: By this study we are presenting a specific and reliable PCR identification system,
which is able to correctly identify E. sakazakii isolates from both phylogenetic distinct lines within
the E. sakazakii species. The impact of this second newly described phylogenetic line within the E.
sakazakii species in view of clinical and food safety aspects need further investigation.

Background
E. sakazakii is considered to be an opportunistic pathogen,
implicated in food borne diseases causing meningitis or
enteritis especially in neonates and infants [1,2]. Mortality
rates of 20 – 50% are reported for patients who contract
the disease [3]. The survivors often suffer from severe neurological disorders. A recent study on the occurrence of E.

sakazakii in production environments from food (milk
powder, chocolate, cereal, potato, pasta) factories and
households isolated the organism with varying frequency
from nearly all environments examined, strongly indicating, that this is a widespread organism [4]. Up to now, E.
sakazakii has been isolated from a wide range of foods,
including cheese, meat, vegetables, grains, herbs and

spices and UHT milk, but most of the literature concentrates on the presence the organism in dried infant formula milk [5-8]. In 1990, Clark et al. [9] were the first to
prove a clear epidemiologic correlation between E. sakazakii isolated from patients and dried infant formula
involved in 2 hospital outbreaks using a combination of
typing methods. Although the levels of contamination
seemed low, the authors could show, that with an initial
concentration of 1 CFU/ml, reconstituted formula stored
at room temperature would take approx. 10 hrs to reach
107 cells per 100 ml and even sooner in formula held on
35 – 37°C. Since then, many case reports have described
this epidemiologic correlation [10,11].
Cultural standard identification procedures for E. sakazakii include the observation of yellow pigmentation of colonies and the testing for α glucosidase activity. Based on
this latter biochemical activity commercially selective
chromogen media have recently been developed such as
the Druggan-Forsythe-Iversen agar, DFI (commercially

available under: Chromogenic Enterobacter sakazakii agar,
Oxoid CM1055, Oxoid, UK) and the Enterobacter Sakazakii Isolation Agar, ESIA (AES Laboratoire, France).
Besides, molecular assays have often proven to be useful
as they offer a alternative means to rapidly and specifically
identify organisms from a wide variety of sources.
Although PCR detection methods are now widely used in
identification of microorganisms, only one PCR system,
based on a single available full-length 16S rRNA gene
sequence of type strain ATCC 29544 [GenBank:
AB004746], was published up to now for E. sakazakii [12].
However, in our hands a preliminary evaluation of this
system on a number of target and non-target strains
showed significant specificity problems inherent in this
assay. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide more
full-length 16S rRNA sequence data from E. sakazakii
strains of different origin. Finally, based on this new
sequence data a specific PCR system was developed for E.
sakazakii detection.

Results and discussion
As a starting point, the full-length 16S rRNA sequences of
thirteen E. sakazakii strains from various sources (five fruit
powder isolates, three human isolates, two production
environment isolates, one milk isolate, one baby food isolate, one milk powder isolate) and of E. sakazakii type
strain ATCC 51329 were determined. This sequence data
has been deposited in the GenBank [AY752936 –
AY752943, AY803186 – AY803192]. Thereafter, a
sequence comparison was performed between the 16S
rRNA genes of the fourteen E. sakazakii strains and the E.
sakazakii type strain ATCC 29544 by calculation of a distance matrix using the ARB programme. Thirteen E. sakazakii strains used in the study exhibited 99.4 to 100%
sequence similarity to the E. sakazakii type strain ATCC
29544 [GenBank: AB004746]. Meanwhile similarity
between strain ATCC 51329 and the strain ATCC 29544
was significantly lower (97.9%).

Phylogenetic affiliation of the newly obtained sequences
to tree_jul04_1450 comprising >28.000 almost fulllength (>1449 nucleotides) 16S rRNA gene sequences
revealed the presence of two phylogenetically distinct lineages within the E. sakazakii species. In figure 1 a subtree
based on the data mentioned above is shown. From this
analyses it can be observed, that thirteen of the fourteen
newly sequenced strains cluster together with the E. sakazakii type strain ATCC 29544, whereas the E. sakazakii
strain ATCC 51329 forms a second branch within this
group. The subtree was calculated using the TREEPUZZLE
tool within the ARB package exhibiting a "consensus tree"
from different calculation methods. The value on each
branch is the percent occurrence of the branching order in
500 bootstrapped trees. The 92% bootstrap value for the
E. sakazakii ATCC 51329 branch strongly supports the theory about the second lineage.

Further qualitative inspection of the sequences revealed
that, besides of the presence of a number of single base
substitutions, at least four "hot spots" of polymorphisms
can be observed along the E. sakazakii 16S rRNA gene (E.
coli positions 187 to 193; 455 to 477, 590 to 600 and
1132 to 1141). Within these regions substitutions ranging
from two to seven bases are present in all strains investigated and are most pronounced in E. sakazakkii strain
ATCC 51329, thus providing the bases for the formation
of the second phylogenetic branch. In table 1, the
sequence polymorphisms in the above mentioned regions
are shown for all E. sakazakii strains investigated in the
study in relation to the E. sakazakii typestrain ATCC
29544, E. cloacae typestrain ATCC13047 and E. coli type
strain ATCC 11775. Recently, a number of E. sakazakii partial sequences were deposited into the public database
[13]. Addition of these partial sequences (mostly the first
500 bp of the 16S RNA gene) to the phylogenetic tree further confirms the presence of the two lineages within the
E. sakazakii species (data not shown). However, for a reliable pylogenetic analyses determination of at least 1000
nucleotides is recommended [14]. The impact of this second phylogenetic line within the E. sakazakii species in
view of clinical and food safety aspects needs further
evaluation.
In a second step, based on our new sequence information,
we designed a specific primer pair for the amplification of
the 16S rRNA gene of strains within the two phylogenetic
lineages of E. sakazakii. They were first evaluated using
PROBE-MATCH tool of the ARB software. Additionally,
BLAST searches were performed against the non-redundant database (nr) of EMBL/GENBANK. Both primers
seemed to be specific. Amplification conditions in the

of 60°C for 1 min.
We then sought to evaluate the utility of the PCR assay
next. In particular the assay's ability to correctly identify
different E. sakazakii strains as well as to differentiate E.
sakazakii from other closely related Enterobacteriacae was
assessed. This was done by applying the assay to purified
genomic DNA template from isolates of 45 known E. sakazakii strains form different origin and 28 non E. sakazakii

and efficiency was also investigated. The target DNA template concentration was held constant at 10 pg while
increasing amount of non-target DNA, purified templates
from B. cereus ATCC 10876, L. acidophilus ATCC 13651, S.

strains. A gel-based example of the screen is shown in figure 2, where E. sakazakii isolates and non-target microorganisms were analyzed. The rest of the results from the
screen are summarized in table 2. The new PCR assay was
able to correctly confirm all the E. sakazakii isolates tested.
There were no amplification products observed when the
non E. sakazakii strains controls were similarly analyzed.
For comparison the various strains were also similarly
analyzed using the PCR system described by Keyser et al.
[12]. The results are summarized in table 2 and confirm
our preliminary evaluation data where we found significant specificity problems with this system. A gel-based
example of the screen is shown in figure 2, where E. sakazakii isolates and non-target microorganisms were analyzed. First the system was not able to detect all the E.
sakazakii strains. By using the PROBE_MATCH tool
included in the ARB software it can be retrieved, that one
of the primers (Esak3) used in the Keyser system exhibits
four mismatches at the 3 prime end to the 16S rRNA gene
sequence of E. sakazakii strain ATCC 51329, thus providing a possible explanation for the negative amplification
result with this strain. Moreover, this system also gives
positive results with some non-target organisms (e.g. E.
cloacae, S. liquefaciens, S. fucaria, S. Enteritidis).
To determine the detection limit of the newly developed
assay, PCR was performed on decreasing amounts of purified DNA template from representatives of the two E.
sakazakii lineages (strain ATCC 51329 and strain ATCC
29544). In both strains a detection limit of 10 pg was

By phylogenetic analysis of the new provided full-length
16S rRNA sequence data we could show the presence of a
second phylogenetic distinct lineage within the E. sakazakii species. Based on this new sequence data we have
developed a 16S rRNA targeting PCR assay, which allows
identification of E. sakazakii strains from both lineages.
The assay's ability to correctly identify different E. sakazakii isolates as well as to differentiate E. sakazakii from
other closely related Enterobacteriaceae species and other
non-target microorganisms was shown. This PCR system
provides a valuable tool for rapid identification of this
food borne pathogen.

Methods
Bacterial strains
Overall, 47 E. sakazakii strains, with isolates from human,
food and environmental origin, as well as 28 non E. sakazakii strains from selected species were included in this
study (Table 2). In a first step, the 16S rRNA genes of fourteen E. sakazakii strains (E. sakazakii ATCC 51329, E. sakazakii 1084 fruit powder isolate, E. sakazakii 954 fruit
powder isolate, E. sakazakii 858 fruit powder isolate, E.

E. sakazakii ES4 human isolate, E. sakazakii ES11 human
isolate, E. sakazakii ES Vo7/24922 human isolate) were
sequenced. Afterwards, all strains were used for validation
of the specificity of the new developed PCR identification
system.

The strains were grown on blood agar plates under appropriate conditions. DNA was extracted from the grown colonies using the DNeasyR Tissue Kit (Qiagen AG,
Switzerland) in accordance with the suppliers' protocol.
16S rRNA amplification and direct sequencing
For 16S rRNA gene amplification, reaction mixtures (total
volume 50 µl) containing primers 616V (5' AGA GTT TGA
TYM TGG CTC 3') and 630R (5' CAK AAA GGA GGT GAT
CC 3') [15] at 10 pmol each were prepared by using the

Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland): 10 × Expand High Fidelity buffer (without
MgCl2), 2.5 mM MgCl2, 200 µM dNTPs each and 3 U
Expand High Fidelity enzyme mix.
The amplification was performed in a T3 thermocycler
(Biometra, Germany). The PCR conditions were: 2 min at
95°C, 10× (94°C, 15 s; 52°C, 30 s; 72°C, 90 s) followed
by 15× (94°C, 15 s; 52°C, 30 s; 72°C, 129 s). Cycling was
completed by a final elongation step at 72°C for 7 min.
After PCR the reaction products were separated on a 1.5%
agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and
visualized under UV light. In cases where sequencing was
desired, the correct size (approx 1500 bp) products were
excised from the gel and purified using the MinElute™ gel
extraction kit (Qiagen, Switzerland). The products were
thereafter sequenced. Sequencing reactions were performed using a modified Sanger method and the Big-Dye
chemistry from Applied Biosystems on an ABI 3730 capillary DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA) employing
the same primer pair as for amplification of the 16S rRNA
gene (616V/630R) and additional internal primers for
"walking reactions". Sequencing was performed by
Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland).
Phylogenetic analysis, tree construction and design of
specific primer
16S rRNA gene sequences of fourteen newly sequenced
strains were added to an alignment of about 28'000
almost full length small subunit rRNA sequences by using
the alignment tool of ARB program package [16]. Alignments were refined by visual inspection. Phylogenetic
analyses were performed by using distance matrix and the
TREEPUZZLE tool of the ARB program. Primer design was
accomplished by applying the PROBE DESIGN tool
included in the software package ARB on special data
structures (PT-Servers) derived from the ssu-rRNA database "ssu_jan04.arb".

The following specific E. sakazakii S16 rRNA gene targeting primers Esakf (5' GCT YTG CTG ACG AGT GGC GG
3') and Esakr (5' ATC TCT GCA GGA TTC TCT GG 3') were
designed and synthesized (Mirosynth, Balgach, Switzerland). This primer pair binds to conserved regions (E. coli
position 88 – 107 (Esakf) and 1017 – 998 (Esakr)) in the
S16 rRNA gene sequences giving an amplicon of 929 bp.
PCR reaction conditions
For amplification, reaction mixtures (total volume 50 µl)
containing primer Esakf and Esakr at a concentration of
10 pM were prepared by using 10 × Taq reaction mixture,
2 U Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI),) and 200
µM dNTPs each. Thermal cycling was carried out by using
an initial denaturation step of 94°C for 2 min, followed
by 29 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec. annealing

temperature for 1 min and elongation at 72°C for 1 min
30 sec. Cycling was completed by a final elongation step
at 72°C for 5 min. Amplification conditions were optimized by gradually increasing the annealing temperature
in the assay from 52°c to 64°C. The reaction products
were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel followed by ethidium
bromide staining and examination under UV light.
