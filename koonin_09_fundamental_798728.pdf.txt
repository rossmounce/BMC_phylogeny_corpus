Abstract
Background: The elucidation of the dominant role of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in the
evolution of prokaryotes led to a severe crisis of the Tree of Life (TOL) concept and intense
debates on this subject.
Concept: Prompted by the crisis of the TOL, we attempt to define the primary units and the
fundamental patterns and processes of evolution. We posit that replication of the genetic material
is the singular fundamental biological process and that replication with an error rate below a certain
threshold both enables and necessitates evolution by drift and selection. Starting from this
proposition, we outline a general concept of evolution that consists of three major precepts.
1. The primary agency of evolution consists of Fundamental Units of Evolution (FUEs), that is, units
of genetic material that possess a substantial degree of evolutionary independence. The FUEs
include both bona fide selfish elements such as viruses, viroids, transposons, and plasmids, which
encode some of the information required for their own replication, and regular genes that possess
quasi-independence owing to their distinct selective value that provides for their transfer between
ensembles of FUEs (genomes) and preferential replication along with the rest of the recipient
genome.
2. The history of replication of a genetic element without recombination is isomorphously
represented by a directed tree graph (an arborescence, in the graph theory language).
Recombination within a FUE is common between very closely related sequences where
homologous recombination is feasible but becomes negligible for longer evolutionary distances. In
contrast, shuffling of FUEs occurs at all evolutionary distances. Thus, a tree is a natural
representation of the evolution of an individual FUE on the macro scale, but not of an ensemble of
FUEs such as a genome.
3. The history of life is properly represented by the "forest" of evolutionary trees for individual
FUEs (Forest of Life, or FOL). Search for trends and patterns in the FOL is a productive direction
of study that leads to the delineation of ensembles of FUEs that evolve coherently for a certain time
span owing to a shared history of vertical inheritance or horizontal gene transfer; these ensembles
are commonly known as genomes, taxa, or clades, depending on the level of analysis. A small set
of genes (the universal genetic core of life) might show a (mostly) coherent evolutionary trend that
transcends the entire history of cellular life forms. However, it might not be useful to denote this

trend "the tree of life", or organismal, or species tree because neither organisms nor species are
fundamental units of life.
Conclusion: A logical analysis of the units and processes of biological evolution suggests that the
natural fundamental unit of evolution is a FUE, that is, a genetic element with an independent
evolutionary history. Evolution of a FUE on the macro scale is naturally represented by a tree. Only
the full compendium of trees for individual FUEs (the FOL) is an adequate depiction of the evolution
of life. Coherent evolution of FUEs over extended evolutionary intervals is a crucial aspect of the
history of life but a "species" or "organismal" tree is not a fundamental concept.

Background
In Chapter 4 of On the Origin of Species [1], Darwin
famously wrote:
"The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes
been represented by a great tree. I believe this simile largely
speaks the truth. The green and budding twigs may represent
existing species; and those produced during each former year
may represent the long succession of extinct species. .... The
limbs divided into great branches, and these into lesser and
lesser branches, were themselves once, when the tree was small,
budding twigs; and this connexion of the former and present
buds by ramifying branches may well represent the classification of all extinct and living species in groups subordinate to
groups."
Although the single figure in the Origin does not, exactly,
depict that putative "great tree", but rather Darwin's ideas
of evolution of species within genera, the fact that the only
illustration in the book shows tree speaks volumes of the
importance of the tree as a metaphor of evolution.
In the 6th edition of the Origin [2], Darwin went further
and explicitly introduced the notion of the Tree of Life
(TOL):
"As buds give rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch,
so by generation I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life,
which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the
earth, and covers the surface with its ever-branching and beautiful ramifications."
Since then, tree thinking in biology became standard and
dominant. Starting with the seminal work of Haeckel [3],
Darwin's abstract tree was populated with concrete life
forms, and for the next century, the TOL was continuously
refined as improving methods of analysis were applied to
growing data collections. The 1960s and 1970s were
marked by the birth and early advances of molecular phylogenetics that, unlike the traditional phenomic phyloge-

netics, deals directly with the evolving substrate, the
sequences of genes (or proteins) [4,5]. Molecular phylogenetics reached maturity by the 1980s when rRNA was
introduced as the universal phylogenetic marker, a development that led to numerous insights including the
momentous discovery of Archaea, the third domain of
life, the existence of which was not even suspected without the rRNA phylogenies [6,7].
Ever since Darwin and throughout the heroic age of
molecular evolution, any phylogenetic tree was automatically assumed to represent the evolutionary history of the
respective organisms - in other words, each such tree was
construed as a "species" or "organismal" tree. This situation started to change when comparison of multiple, complete genomes of prokaryotes (archaea and bacteria)
became possible towards the end of the last century. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) that was discovered in the
pre-genomic era but was generally considered a rare and
non-consequential process (with some notable exceptions [8]) turned out to be a dominant mode of prokaryotic evolution [9-11]. Traditionally, HGT is inferred from
discrepancies between the topologies of the phylogenetic
tree for a given gene and the adopted species tree such as
the rRNA tree, or by massive comparison of individual
gene trees. The results of these comparisons show that,
throughout the history of life, most likely, all genes experienced HGT, albeit with different frequencies [12-14].
Thus, in general, evolutionary histories of all genes are
unique. Moreover, "highways" of HGT have been discovered, for instance, between hyperthermophilic bacteria
and archaea [15-18]. Such strong preferences in HGT have
the potential to produce evolutionary associations
between organisms caused by processes other than vertical phyletic descent [12]. Taken together with the extensive gene loss and emergence of new genes (primarily, via
duplication with subsequent rapid divergence), these discoveries show that genes possess unique individual histories that cannot be adequately described by any single
tree.

Hence a crisis of the entire TOL concept. If the TOL is supposed to be a reflection of the history of all (cellular) life
forms on earth, then, the discovery of the diversity of individual gene histories makes the concept obsolete and
should lead to "uprooting" of the TOL [9,11,19]. Apart
from the increasingly unreasonable attempts to deny the
wide spread and major impact of HGT for evolutionary
biology, there seem to be three cogent ways to deal with
the TOL crisis that I list more or less in the order of their
increasingly radical character [20,21].
1. Make trees for a set of (nearly) universal genes, preferably, several that are mostly coherent, and brand a consensus tree of these genes the TOL.
2. Search for a statistical central trend in the Forest of Life
(FOL), that is, the entire compendium of individual gene
trees, and denote the resulting tree the TOL.
3. Give up the TOL concept and with it the very distinction
between vertical and horizontal gene flows, and replace
tree analysis with the analysis of various types of evolutionary networks.
Here we attempt to outline a fourth path by arguing that
tree representation of evolution is not only reasonable but
is the only natural one because it is inseparable from the
mode of replication of the genetic material, the key biological process that is both necessary and sufficient for
evolution to occur. By contrast, species (organismal) tree
does not appear as a fundamental concept because the
fundamental, Distinct Unit of Evolution (FUE) is any
genetic element with a unique evolutionary history, rather
than an organism or a species. We submit that the appropriate depiction of evolution of life is the Forest of Life
(FOL), that is, the sum total of trees for all FUEs. There
seems to be a considerable degree of order in the FOL
owing to coherent evolution of various groups of genes
that comprise genomes or even species (in the case of sexually reproducing forms). Discovery and investigation of
trends in the FOL is important for understanding evolution but it might not be necessary or even useful to denote
any such trend the Tree of Life.

The concept: Forest of Life as the natural
description of life's history
Replication is both the condition and the direct cause of
evolution
The persistence and evolution of all life forms on earth is
ensured by replication of nucleic acid molecules (represented by double-stranded DNA in all extant cellular
organisms but by single-stranded DNA or RNA in numerous viruses). From an information-theoretical point of
view, replication is the process of copying a one-dimensional string of symbols that is made possible by precise

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/33

rules of correspondence between these symbols (base
complementarity rules). Beyond doubt, replication is the
single central biological process that ensures the continuity of genetic information transmission. It is less commonly realized, however, that replication not only makes
possible but necessitates evolution, or more precisely, that
evolution by random drift and natural selection is a simple and necessary consequence of error-prone replication.
The interpretation of evolution as a straightforward consequence of genetic material replication was apparently first
articulated by the famous Russian geneticists Kol'tsov and
Timofeev-Ressovsky in the late 1920ies, long before the
discovery of the base complementarity and DNA structure
[22]. However, their prescient idea remained unnoticed,
and it seems that the first direct and dramatic proof of this
principle was given in the famous experiments of Spiegelman and coworkers on Darwinian evolution in a test tube
[23,24]. Spiegelman and coworkers put genomic RNA of
bacteriophage QÎ² into conditions that were perfect for
replication (excess of active replicase and substrates), and
then, applied various selective pressures, the simplest one
being limitation of the time available for replication by
serial transfer of aliquots of the reaction mix to new test
tubes. The drastic result of this experiment was that after
only 75 passages the ~4 kilobase phage genome evolved
into a mini variant consisting of about 400 nucleotides
and retaining only the terminal sequences required for the
recognition of the replicase [25]. Variation of the selective
pressure (for instance, limited substrate concentration or
inclusion of inhibitors) led to different evolutionary outcomes [26]. Thus, this bare minimum experimental setup
provides for extremely efficient evolution by natural selection including drastic changes to the evolving molecules
without any requirements other than the opportunity to
replicate. Spiegelman's experiments were devised so as to
ensure the dominance of selection but there is no doubt
that, under different experimental conditions, evolution
via genetic drift would have been prominent.
The obvious condition of evolution in Spiegelman-type
experiments is accumulation of replication errors (mutations in the progeny nucleotide sequences) that generate
variability, the material for selection (or drift). No process
of information transmission can be error-free, a central
staple of information theory that follows from the laws of
thermodynamics [27]. Of course, it is, in principle, imaginable that the error rate of replication, although finite,
would be so low that the great majority of replication
cycles would occur with a 100% fidelity. However, this
does not happen to be the case. The error rate of replication without special repair mechanisms, as seen in the
simplest viruses including QÎ² that was used in Spiegelman's experiments, is in the range of 10-3-10-4 substitution per nucleotide which provides for close to one error
per replication of an average viral genome [28]. Polymer-

ases are also prone to other types of errors, such as slippage, which facilitate evolution by deletion as seen in
Spiegelman's experiments or by duplication [29].
It is almost as intuitively clear that, although for evolution
to occur, replication must be error-prone (and, replication
is, in any case, error-prone owing to physical constraints),
there must also exist an error threshold such that an
above-threshold error rate renders evolution impossible.
Extrapolating to the extreme (absurd), it is obvious that a
"replication" process that incorporates nucleotides randomly is not conducive to evolution (and, of course, does
not really qualify as replication). Spiegelman's experiments stimulated theoretical work by Eigen and coworkers that put the link between replication and evolution
into a mathematical framework and quantified the
requirements to the replication error rate [30]. Eigen's
seminal work and subsequent, increasingly sophisticated
analysis showed that the error threshold, that is, the minimal fidelity that is required for mutations to be fixed and,
accordingly, for evolution to proceed, is relatively low, in
the range of 1-10 errors per replication cycle (the exact
number remains a matter of debate) [31-34]. It appears
that most if not all replicating entities exist on or close to
the edge of the "Eigen cliff", with the fidelity of replication
only slightly exceeding the minimal requirement (Figure
1) [35].

fitness

An intriguing question is whether evolution involves
"selection for evolvability" [36,37] or the existence near
the edge results from the opportunistic character of the
evolutionary process whereby fidelity is increased to the
extent strictly necessary but not far beyond that because
further increase would incur substantial cost of selection.
However, discussion of this important problem is beyond
the scope of this article.

Replicating genetic elements exist close to the replication error threshold.

The error threshold, certainly, is a crucial issue for the
study of the origin of replication - and evolution. There is
a distinct sense of paradox here because high replication
fidelity hardly can be achieved without a complex replication machinery but such a machinery cannot evolve sufficiently accurate replication. Conceptually (but not
necessarily in practice) the paradox is resolved by the
"Darwin-Eigen cycle" in which a mutation leading to an
increase in the complexity of the replicase is fixed if it
leads to increase in fidelity that is greater than that
required to replicate the evolved version of the replicase,
and this increased fidelity in turn allows further growth of
complexity [35,38]. Again, we only need to articulate this
problem here but not discuss the details.
Summarizing the discussion of the intrinsic link between
replication and evolution in what we would like, with
deliberate arrogance, denote "the Central Dogma of evolution" (Figure 1):
-replication of a nucleic acid with the error rate below the
error threshold necessarily leads to evolution by drift and
natural selection
-replication with the error rate above the threshold leads
to evolutionary dead end and eventually extinction of the
respective genetic elements
-(replication with an error rate too low to allow evolution
does not seem to be a practical issue).
A tree as an isomorphous representation of replication
history
In the preceding section, we presented the concept of evolution being a direct consequence of error-prone (but not
too erratic) replication. Here we emphasize that replication and the ensuing evolution are inherently tree-like
processes: a replicating molecule gives rise to two (in the
case of semi-conservative replication of dsDNA that
occurs in all cellular organisms and many viruses) or multiple (in the case of the conservative replication of viruses
with ssDNA or ssRNA genomes) copies with errors, resulting in a tree-like process of divergence (Figure 2a). In
graph-theoretical terms, such a process can be isomorphously represented by a specific form of a directed acyclic
graph known as arborescence that is a generalized tree in
which multifurcations are allowed and all edges are
directed away from the root [39](Figure 2b). A deviation
from this simple pattern is occasional extinction of one or
both progeny molecules; however, the resulting graph in
which some of the vertices emit no edges does not violate
the definition of an arborescence (Figure 2ab) (hereinafter, in order to stick to commonly used terms, we speak of
trees rather than arborescences).

time

A major potential complication to the tree-like character
of evolution is recombination that, if common, would
turn the tree-like representation of the history of a replicating lineage (Figure 2b) into a network. Is it possible to
determine a fundamental, "atomic" level of genetic organization at which recombination is negligible? This does
not seem to be feasible in the case of homologous recombination that is extensive during coreplication of closely
related sequences, in particular, in eukaryotes that engage
in regular sex, and in "quasi-sexual" prokaryotes [40-43].
Essentially, the unit of homologous recombination is a
single basepair. In contrast, homologous recombination
cannot occur between distantly related sequences, so HGT
between diverse prokaryotes involves only non-homologous (illegitimate) recombination complemented by
more specific routes such as dissemination via bacteriophages and plasmids. In contrast to homologous recombination, a strong preference for evolutionary fixation of
non-homologous recombination events outside genes or
between parts of genes encoding distinct domains of
multidomain proteins should be expected because preservation of gene integrity after non-homologous recombination is extremely unlikely. The prevalence of intergenic
recombination in the course of HGT between distantly
related prokaryotes has not been studied in sufficient
detail. Nevertheless, a recent study shows that, at least,
regions encoding relatively small domains are significantly avoided by recombination [44]. Thus, the evolutionary history of a gene or domain is reticulate on the
micro scale owing to homologous recombination but is,
largely, tree-like on the macro scale (Figure 3).
It has been argued and demonstrated on compelling
examples that a tree can well describe relationships that
have nothing to do with common descent, so "tree thinking" was deemed not to be a priori relevant in biology or,
in the very least, not necessarily central in biology [19].
Although valid in itself, this argument seems to miss the

Evolution of a FUE is reticulate on the micro scale
but tree-like on the macro scale. The cartoon schematically depicts the evolution of 4 FUEs shown by different
colors. The divergence history of each FUE was simulated
under the model of random homologous recombination,
with the probability of recombination exponentially decreasing with sequence divergence. At each simulation step, the
two daughter FUEs diverge by a constant amount (clock-like
divergence) and either undergo homologous recombination
(which brings the difference between the two back to zero)
or not, preserving the existing state of divergence. After a
number of short periods of divergence and recombination,
the FUEs stochastically diverge far enough for recombination
to become extremely unlikely after which point they continue diverging without recombination. At a macro scale this
appears as a simple bifurcation in the tree-graph.

crucial point discussed above, namely, that a tree is a necessary formal consequence of the descent history of replicating nucleic acids and the ensuing evolution. Thus, trees
cannot be banished from evolutionary biology for a fundamental reason: they are intrinsic to the evolutionary
process. This being the case, the main pertinent question
becomes: what are the fundamental units whose evolution should be represented by trees? In the practice of evolutionary biology, trees are most often built for individual
genes or for sets of genes that are believed to evolve coherently. However, it is typically implied (or even stated
explicitly) that the ultimate goal is a species (organismal)
tree. We believe that the lack of clarity about the basic unit
to which tree analysis applies is the source of the entire
TOL controversy.
Distinct units of evolution: the fundamental agency of
(tree-like) evolution
Conceptually, the answer to the question posed at the end
of the preceding section seems clear: the fundamental unit
of evolution can be most adequately defined as the small-

(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:33

est portion of genetic material with a distinct evolutionary
trajectory, that is, evolving independently of other such
units at least during some periods of evolution. We would
like to introduce the notion of Distinct Units of Evolution
(FUE) whose key characteristic is the potential of differential reproduction that makes them subject to selection
independently of other FUEs.
It seems useful to differentiate two classes of FUEs:
i) bona fide selfish elements such as viruses, viroids,
transposons, and plasmids - all these elements encode
some of the information required for their replication
and are united through their ability to promote their
evolutionary success by exploiting resources of other
organisms [45]
ii) quasi-independent elements that do not encode
devices for their own replication but possess distinct
selective value and, in that capacity, can be transferred
between ensembles of FUEs (genomes) and promote
their own replication along with the rest of the
genome - essentially, any functional gene or even a
portion of a gene encoding a distinct protein domain
with an independent functional role fits this definition.
The concept of FUEs obviously borrows from the "selfish
gene" idea of Dawkins [46] and the selfish operon
hypothesis of Lawrence and Roth [47,48]. These concepts
might generate a degree of confusion by assigning "selfishness" to genetic elements that do not actively contribute to their own replication at the mechanistic level. It
seems that the partitioning of FUEs into two distinct
classes eliminates this tension.
Of course, like any definition, the definition of a FUE
meet its share of difficulties when one considers that
many of the FUEs of the first kind consist of multiple FUEs
of the second kind. Nevertheless, the distinction between
the two types of FUEs seems an important one to make,
given the major effect the selfishness of the first type of
FUEs has on their evolutionary trajectories. Furthermore,
the notion of a FUE can appear murky when one considers that even small functional elements such as promoters
or enhancers, under some circumstances, have the potential of behaving like FUEs. Nevertheless, we believe that
this concept is fundamental to our understanding of evolution. Indeed, given the extensive HGT that dominates
the prokaryotic world, any gene or a portion of a gene
encoding a distinct domain possesses a degree of independence and can be fixed in the recipient population
even if the conferred advantage is relatively small, or even
neutrally [49]. Therefore the prokaryotic genetic universe
is most appropriately viewed as consortium of FUEs with
varying degrees of independence some of which form

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/33

ensembles that evolve over extended time intervals and
are more commonly known as genomes of viruses, plasmids, and cellular life forms [50].
Perhaps, an even stronger motivation for the FUE concept
comes from the theoretical research and simple logical
considerations on pre-cellular evolution. It appears outright inconceivable that the first replicating elements were
comparable in size and complexity to modern prokaryotic
genomes. Instead, evolution of life must have started with
ensembles of relatively small FUEs some of which would
provide means for the replication of others that in turn
would provide other benefits such as precursor synthesis,
resulting in symbiotic relationships; other fully selfish elements would necessarily parasitize on such ensembles.
Physical joining of FUEs would have been beneficial in
many cases, provided sufficient replication fidelity, so the
maximum size of a FUE would increase in the course of
evolution. Qualitative and quantitative models of this collective phase of life's evolution have been developed
[35,51-54]. In particular, we argued that this pre-cellular
stage of evolution could be considered virus-like in many
respects, and that the principal classes of extant viruses
and other selfish elements emerged already at that stage
[45,55]. There is an ongoing debate with regard to where
in the history of life this collective stage belongs, and in
particular, whether or not the Last Universal Cellular
Ancestor (LUCA) was a typical cell, a cell with a fragmented genome, or a pre-cellular ensemble of genetic elements [52,56,57]. The discussion of the arguments pro
and contra each of these models is beyond the scope of
the present article but, in principle, there is no reasonable
doubt as to the reality of the collective stage. Furthermore,
it is often and reasonably argued that extensive mixing
and matching of FUEs (that may or may not be called
HGT depending on whether or not this stage is envisaged
as cellular) was not only an inherent feature of this evolutionary stage but also a pre-requisite of a rapid increase in
genetic and organizational complexity of life forms
[45,52,55,58,59].
Considering the virtual inevitability of an early collective
stage of evolution and the extensive HGT that permeates
modern prokaryotic world, it stands to reason to view the
entire evolution of prokaryotes as a dynamic process that
plays out on the network of FUEs although relatively stable genomes consisting of hundreds and thousands of
FUEs, of course, are major components of that network
[50]. This view of the prokaryotic world implies that FUEs
are fundamental units of evolution whereas all other levels of genetic organization are best considered to be
derived.
The dominant pattern of evolution of eukaryotes, at least,
of multicellular plants and animals is different: genomes
are much more stable so that congruent evolution of large

Biology Direct 2009, 4:33

set of genes (FUEs) is the rule, and a species tree can be
viewed as a (more or less) natural construct. However,
evolution of unicellular eukaryotes, especially, those with
a phagotrophic lifestyle, involves substantial levels of
HGT [60,61], and even more strikingly, evolution of
eukaryotes is a series of endosymbiotic events, from the
primary mitochondrial endosymbiosis to a variety of secondary ones including the acquisition of the chloroplast
by the common ancestor of plants and algae [62,63].
Moreover, mobile selfish elements make tremendous contributions to the evolution of eukaryotic genomes [64].
Thus, in our view, the only fundamental unit of evolution,
both in prokaryotes and in eukaryotes, that can be defined
without internal contradictions is a FUE although long
stages of evolution of major groups of organisms certainly
exist for which the concept of a species tree - and species
as such - makes sense.
The Forest of Life and trends in it
If (i) FUEs are fundamental units of evolution, whereas all
other levels of organization of the genetic material including genomes are derived, and (ii) a tree is a necessary form
of description of the evolution of any FUE, then, the adequate representation of evolution of life as a whole is the
full compendium of FUE-specific trees that can be conveniently denoted the Forest of Life (FOL). This being the
case, the notion of a species tree becomes, if not obsolete,
at least secondary, applicable to some phases of evolution
of some groups of organisms but not in general, hence not
particularly important. This conclusion is not to be taken
as an indication that there is no order in the FOL, and that
signals of coherence among the trees are not to be sought.
Such patterns are indeed discernible [65], and the central
trend, even if relatively weak, seems to correspond to the
signal of apparent vertical inheritance detectable in the
phylogenies of genes encoding components of the translation machinery [66]. There seem to be other trends in
the FOL as well, some of these, most likely reflecting preferential routes of HGT. A comprehensive exploration of
the FOL is the primary goal of phylogenomics.

Conclusion
A logical analysis of the units and processes of biological
evolution suggests that:
-replication is the central, most fundamental process in
biology;
-error-prone replication is both necessary and sufficient
for evolution via drift and natural selection;
-the natural fundamental unit of evolution is a FUE, that
is, a genetic element with an independent evolutionary
history;

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/33

-the natural and necessary representation of evolution of
a FUE on the macro scale is a tree (more precisely, an
arborescence).
A corollary of these simple propositions is that the proper
representation of the history of life is the entire Forest of
Life. Search for order in the FOL can reveal important
trends explained either by congruent vertical evolution of
sets of FUEs of varying size, or by "highways" of HGT. In
contrast, the quest for an all-encompassing TOL is futile.
Darwin was entirely correct in his belief that a tree is an
accurate depiction of the evolutionary process but, for
obvious reasons, he was unable to correctly identify the
fundamental unit of evolution.

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer 1: Valerian Dolja, Oregon State University
This is another installation in the series of Koonin solo
and Koonin & Wolf duo papers dealing with the most fundamental and hotly debated problems of evolutionary
genomics. It is very timely, incisive, cool, pragmatic, certainly, not "the final truth", but about the best that can be
offered at the moment. It also helps that the style of the
paper shows enviable intellectual candor and clarity.
Although I am not directly involved in the TOL business,
I felt compelled to review this paper even from a prospective of a virologist interested in the big picture of life origin and evolution.

One conclusion of the essay, that the pursuit of a 'simple
and true' organismal TOL is over due to overwhelming
contributions of HGT to the life histories of viruses,
prokaryotes, and unicellular eukaryotes, the organisms
that together represent the substantial majority of genetic
universe, is the only conclusion fully compatible with the
results of comparative genomics. Another major conclusion, that evolution of individual genes is faithfully represented by trees, whereas evolution of organisms (or,
preferably, genomes) can only be rendered as a FOL, also
seems to be an inevitable outcome of the presented logical
analysis of the units and processes of molecular evolution.
Importantly, these conclusions provide a sensible and
constructive alternative to the fierce and increasingly futile
argument about the viability of the TOL.
Having said this, I would like to comment on two particular aspects of the analysis offered by Koonin and Wolf.
1. After going through two incarnations of the work, I
am not yet at peace with the FUE definition. I would

Page 7 of 13

Biology Direct 2009, 4:33

prefer defining FUE as a genomic unit encoding protein, protein domain, structural or regulatory RNA, or
a control element with independent evolutionary history. [Evolutionary Unit of a Genome, or EUG]. I do
not see a need in categorizing FUEs into selfish elements such as viruses on one hand, and regular genes
on the other. First, selfish elements, with the exception
of viroids, are ensembles of 'regular genes' even
though some of them encode replication-related functions. Second, some of the regular genes of the 'nonselfish', that is, cellular genomes, are also involved in
replication. Third, both selfish elements and cellular
genomes are collections of genes of various 'selfishness quotient', all of which are equal subjects to HGT.
Therefore, both cellular and noncellular genomes represent the same genetic continuum that can be analyzed in its entirety using the same rules and
approaches.
Authors' response: We do not really see any contradiction
between the FUE definition and the EUG definition suggested by Dolja (we do appreciate the EUphony of the latter). As for partitioning of the FUEs into the selfish and
non-selfish classes, we tend to believe that the validity and
usefulness of this classification is an open question that is
subject to quantitative analysis using an appropriate mathematical framework and the available extensive comparative-genomic data. Indeed, any FUE, in principle, can be
assigned a 'selfishness quotient'. However, the correct formula for this quotient let alone the distribution of its values
across FUEs remain unknowns. Once this formula is
derived and the distribution is drawn, the issue of the classification of FUEs will become tractable. If the distribution
turns out to be bimodal, the two classes will be rectified; if
by contrast, the distribution is unimodal, the continuum
model will be more appropriate. This problem is the target
of an ongoing investigation in our group.
2. I am not sure I can fully agree with the statement
that the FUE rather than the organism or species (or,
better, the genome) is the only fundamental agency of
evolution. The genome is, indeed, a true unit of replication, and as such, also has a unique evolutionary
history. Focusing solely on FUEs leaves behind the
entire realm of population genetics that, as groundbreaking work of Michael Lynch has demonstrated, is
one of the major determinants of the evolution of
genome architecture. In other words, the laws of
genome evolution are not reducible merely to sum
total of FUEs' evolutionary histories because how the
ensemble of FUEs put together depends in large part
on population dynamics that is not determined by
FUEs per se.
Authors' response: We do not agree with such a categorical statement either and do not believe that it is contained

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/33

or even implied in this article. Genomes are also fundamental and so are populations of organisms. However, in some
ways, in particular, with respect to evolutionary independence and the applicability of trees as models of evolution
FUEs appear...well, more equal than those other units. As
for the groundbreaking work of Lynch, this is a bit ironic
but a good idea to clarify. Lynch actually emphasizes that
the effective population size, even in eukaryotes, where horizontal transfer is not much of an issue, the effective population size (the key parameter of the theory) is, generally,
different for different genes. So we are not at all leaving
behind population genetics which is indeed crucial for
understanding evolution at any level - it seems that the true
unit of evolution within the population-genetic framework
is...a FUE.
Reviewer 2: W. Ford Doolittle, Dalhousie University
Koonin and Wolf aptly present one of the several possible
responses to the Tree of Life kerfuffle, although their paper
won't likely make the conflict just go away, as they and
many readers no doubt wish. What these authors hope to
do is displace the Tree of Life with a "Forest of Life" as the
all-embracing metaphor for the history of living things.
This is progress within the paradigm, to be sure, and I
think they are right to point out, for instance, that because
homologous recombination falls off as gene sequences
diverge but lateral gene transfer uses mechanisms that are
indifferent to gene sequence, gene evolution is inherently
tree-like while genome evolution is not.

What I am less sure of is that we really need to "define the
primary units and the fundamental patterns and processes
of evolution". It is this kind of deep metatheoretical
approach that gave us the Tree of Life in the first place and
that keeps us on the hotseat in the ongoing struggle
against the proponents of intelligent design and other
nonsensical nonscience. Really, we understand pretty well
all the individual genetic, population, ecological and
environmental mechanisms that effect the evolution of
genes, genomes, organisms and species, and we waste our
times (and make ourselves vulnerable to creationist pettifoggery) by imagining there are causal processes or patterns deeper than these that we need to conceptualize.
(The introduction of graph theoretical language really
does not get us any closer to some fundamental truth, I
think.)
It may well be sensible to talk about Fundamental Unit (s)
of Evolution (FUE), but authors have a rather limited
range of such units they will consider, and perhaps too
much faith in their boundedness. Organisms, populations and even species can be FUEs, and over their own
appropriate time scales are every bit as much "fundamental units of life" as are genes, while all sorts of entities in
between can "evolve coherently for a certain time span."
Again, I question the sense of describing one level or unit
Page 8 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:33

as more fundamental than another, but such is common
practice and no reason not to consider this a valuable contribution in that tradition. So the rest of my remarks will
be quibbles about specifics.
Authors' response: We realize the dangers (and the seductions) of metanarratives [67]. And yet, we also tend to think
that, in different domains of physical reality, there are distinct
levels that are central to the adequate description and "understanding" of each domain. Molecules are fundamental to
(bio)chemistry, cells to physiology (broadly construed), stars to
astrophysics, galaxies to cosmology. In the same sense, we maintain that our FUEs are fundamental units of evolution which by
no means applies that other levels are unimportant.
1. In my copy of the Origin, its only figure appears
eight pages before the quoted passage, and is clearly
meant to illustrate evolution of the "species of a genus
large in its own country", not the great tree 'simile"
whose veracity Darwin accepted. The quote does not
"introduce" the figure. Not that this should really matter: it's remarkable the extent to which accurate readings of Darwin seem essential to the credibility of
current theory, as if evolutionary biology actually were
the quasi-religious enterprise our opponents treat it as.
Authors' response: although there is absolutely no religious bend in our attitude to Darwin (or anyone/thing
else), we do maintain that the Origin is, possibly, THE
greatest book ever published, so precision is highly desirable
when it is discussed, and correction much appreciated. The
respective text was modified to eliminate any misrepresentation.
2. The Spiegelman experiments were certainly exciting
and important (and I had the good fortune to have
summer jobs in Sol's lab while they were going on).
But I think that what impressed the community about
these experiments was that they actually worked, and
so well, rather than that they proved that evolution
could occur as "straightforward consequence of
genetic material replication". Probably no one
doubted that.
Authors' response: Seems to be a bit of a semantic issue.
Perhaps, no one questioned evolution "in principle"...but
few believed it would work "so well". We emphasize this
aspect in the revision: "including drastic changes to the
evolving molecules".
3. I don't think we (ref. [19]) really meant that treethinking is not relevant in biology, but rather that it
was only one way to think about biology.
Authors' response: we wrote "not a priori relevant" which
makes a difference. In any case, in the revision, it is "so

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/33

"tree thinking" was deemed not to be a priori relevant in
biology or, in the very least, not necessarily central in biology".
4. The authors' view (which I share) that all or most all
gene families have different evolutionary histories
entails that the different last common ancestral versions of the different gene families existed at different
times in the past, in different genomes. There was no
LUCA, if by that we mean a single cell whose genome
contained the ancestors of all modern genes. It really
makes no sense to think of a population as "the ancestor", which is what I think authors mean by the statement "there is no reasonable doubt as to the reality of
the collective stage". Today's cells comprise a population that derives from successively earlier populations,
but there is no principled way to designate any one of
these as LUCA.
Authors' response: Actually, we largely agree with this position on LUCA [45,52] and argue elsewhere that it is probably
more appropriate to speak of LUCAS, the Last Universal Common Ancestral State [55,68]. Here, however, we were disinclined to take a strong stance on this issue that is not really the
subject of the article.
Reviewer 3: Nicolas Galtier, CNRS - UniversitÃ© Montpellier

This paper exposes the pros and cons of using trees to represent evolution, especially in prokaryotes. Genes or gene
portions are defined as fundamental evolving entities
(FUEs), and the relationship between gene trees, species
trees, and the "tree of life" are discussed. I liked the direct
and provocative tone of the text, and the clarity of the
viewpoint newly expressed.
- Statements with which I fully agree
1. Evolution results from replication with error.

2. Trees are a natural, useful representation of evolving molecules (genes).
(but see comment 5)
3. The forest of gene trees is to be searched for patterns and
trends.
4. The central trend has a strong, obvious meaning in animals
and plants (if one appropriately accounts for endosymbiosis),
less clearly so in microorganisms, depending on the prevalence
of horizontal gene transfer.
- Statements which I think could deserve additional empirical support
5. Within-gene nonhomologous recombination (i.e., HGT of
pieces of genes) is rare.

Biology Direct 2009, 4:33

I am not sure this issue has been examined with the necessary care. People typically build gene trees, without systematically checking potential conflicts between portions
of genes.
Authors' response: It is true that this has not been empirically
studied with the necessary care and detail, and in the revised
manuscript we changed the language to reflect this. We also
cite a recent study that at least demonstrates preferential recombination outside regions encoding relatively small domains
[44].
6. There are substantial levels of horizontal gene transfer
in unicellular eukaryotes
I'm not sure which studies this statement refers to, and
which taxa are concerned.
Authors' response: There is actually considerable amount of
data on different unicellular eukaryotes. As it is not our intention here to get into the details on this particular subject, in the
revised text, we cite two review articles that summarize the
detected instances of HGT in unicellular eukaryotes [60,61]
- Statements with which I am not sure I agree
7. Genes as the fundamental evolving unit

The definition of FUEs (Fundamental Units of Evolution)
is the most original, and perhaps controversial, aspect of
this manuscript. It is proposed that not only self-replicating genes, but also regular genes (or protein domains),
should be considered the basic evolutionary entities,
genomes (species) being seen as transient groups of genes
of little evolutionary relevance. Although formally conceivable and intellectually appealing, I am not sure this
view will prove to be a useful representation of the evolutionary process.
First, I note that FUEs are defined operationally: we essentially call FUE a maximal (in size) genetic element whose
evolutionary history can be unambiguously represented
by a single, bifurcating tree. Then, page 12, it is said that
FUEs are "subject to selection independently of other
FUEs". This is an important, questionable shift, which I
think reveals a fundamental problem we have with HGT:
the decoupling of transmission and selection (of the
genetic material). Genomes (organisms), not genes, are
the competing entities, between which natural selection
operates, but genes can sometimes be transmitted
between genomes.
Authors' response: There are several fundamental issues here,
and there might be some genuine conceptual disagreement. We
strongly believe that selection is a multilevel phenomenon that
does affect individual FUEs although it certainly also acts at

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/33

ensembles of FUEs, up to the organismal and, possibly, higher
levels. Furthermore, it seems important to mephasize that we do
not define a FUE as Â«genetic element whose evolutionary history can be unambiguously represented by a single, bifurcating
treeÂ». What we argue is that tree-like evolution is an inalienable property of FUEs. Furthermore, we also believe that there is
a strong, intrinsic link between transmission and selection of
genetic elements that works both ways: elements that are subject
to selection are most likely to be transmitted, and elements that
have a high transmission potential are the most selectable ones.
The logical but somewhat extreme viewpoint taken in this
manuscript, in which transmission units are called evolutionary units (irrespective of selection units), appears to
me not devoid of problems. For instance, it calls "evolving" items (genes) that most biologists would not call "living", although evolution is central in, e.g., MaynardSmith's definition of life. The FUE concept also weakens
the importance of species, and consequently taxinomy
and systematics, and tends to separate evolution from
ecology, and micro- from macro-evolution.
Authors' response: As argued above, transmission units are
not actually separated from evolutionary units under our concept. On the contrary, there is a strong connection between the
two. With regard to definitions of life and what most biologists
will or will not call "living", we cannot bring ourselves to care.
We certainly do not claim that FUEs are "alive" (or otherwise,
"not alive"). They are essential units of the biological world,
and that is more than enough. A recent debate on whether
viruses are "alive or not" and how relevant the answer to that
question is to our understanding of evolution provides a perspective on this issue [69-71].
Denying species the role of evolving units because of the
existence of phylogenetic problems appears questionable
to me. Species are typically defined irrespective of phylogeny. Nobody would deny Homo sapiens the species status, although we are phylogenetically the combination of
two ancestral species (a proto-eukaryote and a protomitochondrion). The reason why we have problems
defining species in prokaryotes is lack of sexual reproduction, not HGTs.
Authors' response: On this issue there seems to be no fundamental disagreement but rather a semantic one. Indeed, species
can be meaningfully defined only for life forms with regular sexual reproduction and the resulting reproductive isolation (from
other species). Accordingly, prokaryotes do not "really" form
species [43]. Animals certainly do form species (sensu Mayr).
There is no reason to deny Homo sapiens the species status but
it is useful to remember that this species goes back only some 56 million years not to the time of the mitochondrial symbiogenesis.

8. Unnecessary, unimportant tree of life
I would like to know more about the prevalence of HGT
before adopting this conclusion (and see ref 62 for a
detailed version of Vincent Daubin's and my opinion on
the subject). Let me just recall that the proportion of genes
whose history has been affected by HGT is not a good
measure of how much HGT blurs the species tree, since
this proportion will mechanically increase as you add species (and one cannot reasonably argue he knows less and
less about the species tree as he includes more and more
data). Imagine a data set made of 1000 genes in 10000
species, in which every gene tree is distant only a single
HGT from the consensus tree. I would be happy to draw
this "tree of 0%", and call it the tree of life (and use it to
map and study HGT events), even though not a single
gene fully agrees with it. We need better measures of the
phylogenetic impact of HGT.
Authors' response: This seems to be a difference of degree not
really kind. We agree that there is a central trend in the Forest
of Life, and one may choose to denote it the tree of life although
we are reluctant to do so. But we also know that the topologies
of the trees in the FOL are highly inconsistent and that there is
a substantial fraction of genes for which HGT is common [66].
Of course, we are not going to debate the point about the need
to better measure the phylogenetic impact of HGT - yes, certainly, it needs to be measured better.
Reviewer 4: William Martin, University of Duesseldorf
I'm not terribly keen on this paper. It first sets up a tree of
life crisis: is the history of life shaped like a tree in the
sense that Darwin envisaged or is it not because unbeknownst to Darwin different genes have different histories. It then purports to solve the tree of life crisis by
conjuring up a fundamental unit of evolution (FUE) that
is defined as a thing having "a substantial degree of evolutionary independence" (a very soft definition that could
apply to a nucleotide or a human being, depending upon
the meaning of substantial) and taken here to mean
nucleotide stretches of some length. They point out that
FUEs, if energetically coerced to replicate and mutate in
the absence of recombination, generate tree-like structures
of genealogy over time, which I think we already knew.
Then they stride into the conclusions that the history of
life is properly represented by the sum of all FUE-trees,
giving the forest of life (the FOL), but without providing
such a graphical representation or approximation thereof,
and surmise that "a species or organismal tree is not a fundamental concept". My beef is this: By declaring the object
of debate (an organismal tree) not to be a fundamental
concept, they do not contribute to the debate, but open up
a different one that detracts from the one at hand. For
example, I could say "no FUE can go about its replication
business without some source of energy being tapped,

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/33

such that replication is not a fundamental concept, energy
is the issue," but that does not help us to review this paper,
it just opens up a different issue. In my view, that is what
the present paper does in the context of the present
debate.
Moving swiftly to the final passage of the text, with the
content of which I completely disagree, we see that it says:
"Darwin was entirely correct in his belief that a tree is an
accurate depiction of the evolutionary process but, for
obvious reasons, he was unable to correctly identify the
fundamental unit of evolution." I think I can discern what
the first part of that sentence means in the context of this
paper, but it is only true in the absence of recombination,
and the question of what the fundamental units of evolution are is distinct from what people are debating, namely
is there a tree of life or is there not? Moreover, no gene-like
molecule (FUE) replicates by itself, it needs a cell to do
that, so that the salient argument of what the units of evolution are fails, in my view.
One aspect of the current debate is nicely summed up in a
passage on page 4025 of Galtier and Daubin [65], where
they write:
"Recently, several authors have questioned the usefulness of
the species tree in prokaryote evolutionary genomics, based
on the observation that only a tiny fraction (1% or less) of
reconstructed gene trees are congruent with the reconstructed species tree (Dagan & Martin 2006; Bapteste et al.
2008). This, we think, is not a correct argument. In our
view, the species tree could still be a useful concept even if
incongruent with every gene tree, as we now discuss in more
detail.
Owing to incomplete lineage sorting, roughly 30 per cent of
human genes do not support the (gorilla, (human, chimpanzee)) topology (Hobbolt et al. 2007). This problem
must concern other recently diverged triplets of primate species. If we think of a dataset made of 10 such triplets (plus
other species), then only 3 per cent (0.710) of true gene
trees will be identical to the species tree. As we add more
species, and more triplets affected by incomplete lineage
sorting, this percentage decreases. Does this mean that the
primate species tree is useless? Obviously not."
The foregoing quote discusses prokaryote genome evolution and lineage sorting in primate gene divergence in the
same breath, as if they were the same process and subject
to the same mechanisms. They are not. Meiosis is different
from conjugation, transduction, natural competence,
gene transfer agents as in Rhodobacter, and integrons and
has different consequences over geological time. Some of
us are projecting our views of evolution as obtained from
the study of vertebrate phylogeny, which is tree-like, onto

Page 11 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:33

prokaryote evolution, which is not. In doing so, we are
forcing the data from prokaryotes into the conceptual
straightjacket of a tree, or filtering the observations from
genomes so that only those that look tree-like come to be
registered for interpretation. A better distinction needs to
be made in this debate between eukaryotes, which
undergo reciprocal recombination, and prokaryotes,
which do not.
And the present paper? The present paper calls the FOL
the solution and asserts that the search for the FOL is the
grail, and that "the quest for an all-encompassing tree is
futile". Well, in the paper where the FOL is presented [66],
Koonin and Wolf surmise that there is some central trend
and show trees of life. I see some inconsistency there, but
no matter.

Authors' response: In our opinion, no inconsistency whatever.
We show trees that reflect the central trend that objectively
exists in the FOL [66] and this is how we discuss the issue here.
One may choose to call describe this central trend "a tree of life"
but we at least find this more misleading than helpful given the
difference from the traditional "species tree" definition.
As I see it, the current tree of life debate, whether crisis or
not, is about the things that Ford Doolittle has recently
summed up elsewhere [72]. My own views on the issue
are largely similar to Doolittle's and are to some extent
expressed in a different paper having many authors that is
also submitted to Biology Direct at this time [73].
