Abstract
Background: In gnathostomes, chemosensory receptors (CR) expressed in olfactory epithelia are
encoded by evolutionarily dynamic gene families encoding odorant receptors (OR), trace amineassociated receptors (TAAR), V1Rs and V2Rs. A limited number of OR-like sequences have been
found in invertebrate chordate genomes. Whether these gene families arose in basal or advanced
vertebrates has not been resolved because these families have not been examined systematically in
agnathan genomes.
Results: Petromyzon is the only extant jawless vertebrate whose genome has been sequenced.
Known to be exquisitely sensitive to several classes of odorants, lampreys detect fewer amino acids
and steroids than teleosts. This reduced number of detectable odorants is indicative of reduced
numbers of CR gene families or a reduced number of genes within CR families, or both, in the sea
lamprey. In the lamprey genome we identified a repertoire of 59 intact single-exon CR genes,
including 27 OR, 28 TAAR, and four V1R-like genes. These three CR families were expressed in
the olfactory organ of both parasitic and adult life stages.
Conclusion: An extensive search in the lamprey genome failed to identify potential orthologs or
pseudogenes of the multi-exon V2R family that is greatly expanded in teleost genomes, but did find
intact calcium-sensing receptors (CASR) and intact metabotropic glutamate receptors (MGR). We
conclude that OR and V1R arose in chordates after the cephalochordate-urochordate split, but
before the diversification of jawed and jawless vertebrates. The advent and diversification of V2R
genes from glutamate receptor-family G protein-coupled receptors, most likely the CASR,
occurred after the agnathan-gnathostome divergence.

Background
While the general features of the olfactory system are
remarkably conserved among vertebrates, the chemosensory receptor gene families expressed there have experienced dramatic diversification [1]. Odor detection and
discrimination is accomplished by the interaction of
odorous ligands with receptors located on the cilia or
microvilli found on the dendritic ends of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), and will necessarily depend upon
the number of individual receptors and their specificities
[2]. In this paper we use the term chemosensory receptor
(CR) to refer to all known G protein-coupled receptors
that interact with odorant molecules in olfactory epithelia. CR genes have been a subject of much interest since
their discovery, because of their persistence in diverse animal taxa, their roles in social and environmental interactions, and their expansion and divergence between
vertebrate lineages [3,4]. CR genes exhibit the seven transmembrane domain structure characteristic of the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) superfamily and are
predominantly expressed in ORNs. Genes encoding large
families of candidate CRs have been identified in all vertebrate groups, from lamprey to teleosts, and from
amphibians to humans [5,6].
All studies conducted to date indicate that representatives
of OR, TAAR, V1R and V2R gene families were present in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/180

the most recent common ancestor of jawed vertebrates
[7]. These four families of CR genes display strikingly different evolutionary dynamics and lineage-specific phylogenetic clustering driven by environmental and life
history challenges, as well as genome-scale events over the
past 450 million years [7-9]. The OR family, for instance,
has expanded explosively in the vertebrate lineage and has
become the largest gene family described in mammalian
genomes [4]. Further, the V1R family has expanded largely
in tetrapods and the V2R family has expanded in teleost
fishes and amphibians [10]. On the other hand, only a
very limited number of potential orthologs of vertebrate
OR genes have been identified in the representative
genomes of all major phylogenetic groups of invertebrate
chordates [11-14]. This striking contrast implicates the
significance of CR expansion in the vertebrate radiation,
and raises an interesting question on the timing of the origins and initial expansion of all CR gene families (Figure
1). Clearly, genomes representing the jawless stage of vertebrate evolution, the last chordate group whose genomes
have yet to be examined systematically for CR families,
hold the key information to address this question.
Recently, the sea lamprey genome has been sequenced
and made available for examination. Lamprey and hagfishes form a monophyletic group representing the earliest extant primitive vertebrates [15,16]. Extensive electro-

Proposed evolution of rhodopsin- and glutamate-family chemosensory receptor genes in chordate and vertebrate lineages
Proposed evolution of rhodopsin- and glutamate-family chemosensory receptor genes in chordate and vertebrate lineages. All representative vertebrate genomes listed have been analyzed. Trace amine-associated receptors were
present in the common ancestor of chordates. Olfactory- and V1R pheromone receptor genes arose before the divergence of
gnathostome and agnathan vertebrate lineages, but are absent from the genomes of those lower chordates described to date.
Previous studies show that V2R pheromone receptors are widely diversified in higher vertebrates but have not been identified
in the genome or olfactory organ transcriptome of the representative agnathan Petromyzon. Chemosensory receptor subfamilies in echinoderms have derived from biogenic amine receptors and have expanded in a lineage-specific manner. Arrows
indicate nodes where gene families are first detected.

olfactogram (EOG) studies indicate that the number of
compounds detected by sea lampreys is more restricted
than in teleosts [17,18]. The sea lamprey olfactory system
is highly sensitive to pheromonal bile acids. However, in
direct contrast to teleost olfactory systems, which are
highly sensitive to most amino acids, the sea lamprey
olfactory system is highly sensitive only to arginine and
lysine. Molecular cloning studies in European river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis) revealed two unrelated families
of odorant receptor (OR) genes, one of which resembles
typical ORs identified in other vertebrates [19]. The second family shows little sequence identity with any previously described ORs, and is more similar to class A GPCRs
for biogenic amines [20]. It is expected that many of these
receptors in sea lampreys are expressed in the single,
medially positioned main olfactory organ. Posterior to
this main organ is an accessory olfactory organ whose epithelial lining may contain cells resembling the ORNs
found in the main olfactory epithelium [21]. The olfactory capsule in larvae consists of a small pouch with a
region of sensory epithelium containing mature olfactory
receptor neurons at the caudal end, and responds to many
of the same odorants as in adults [18]. During metamorphosis sea lamprey larvae transform into parasites, possessing eyes, an oral disk and a greatly elaborated olfactory
system, feeding by attaching to other fish and consuming
blood and body fluids. Parasitic-stage adults cease feeding
before migrating into rivers where they become sexually
mature, spawn and die. Here we use the term "parasite" to
refer to an actively feeding adult removed from free living
fish in northern Lakes Huron and Michigan, and the term
"adult" to indicate sexually mature lamprey collected
from spawning streams. Each of these stages relies upon a
functional olfactory system and many of their behaviors
are regulated to some extent by odorants [18]. This complex life history offers an opportunity to examine and
decipher changes in vertebrate odorant reception at distinct developmental stages.

receptor genes (E-values ≤ 1 × 10-10). One hundred and
eight of these contigs with open reading frames larger
than 600 bp were identified by batch BLASTP queries of
the NCBI non-redundant protein database as potential CR
genes. Potential CRs were considered pseudogenes if they
possessed incomplete predicted 7-transmembrane helices, lacked start codons or stop codons, or were highly
fragmented. Fifty-two CR pseudogenes were identified,
including thirty-five OR pseudogenes and 17 TAAR pseudogenes. Of the one hundred and eight potential CR
sequences >600 bp, twelve were identified as histamine-,
glycine- and 5-hydoxytryptamine-(5HTR) receptors. Fiftynine of the one hundred and eight potential CR genes
were intact single-exon chemosensory receptors and were
included for phylogenetic analysis [see Additional File 1].
Assembly of long scaffolds from the sea lamprey genome
has been hindered by the presence of long, repeat-rich
regions. Multiple intact CRs occurred on eight contigs,
separated by distances ranging from 6.5 kb to 24 kb, with
an average distance between intact CR genes of 13.5 kb.
Three contigs possessed three CRs (stigs 6425, 3267,
2594), and seven contigs possessed two CRs (stigs 2407,
3721, 7446, 9755, 1853, 14718 15153). The remaining
36 intact CRs occurred singly, and no supercontigs possessed more than three CRs. The calcium-sensing receptors and V1R-like genes described here occurred
individually on separate contigs. Intact OR and TAAR
genes occurring on the same contig cluster together with
high bootstrap support in NJ analysis (Figure 2), and no
contigs were found to contain members from more than
one CR gene family. NJ analysis of the lamprey calciumsensing receptor genes and V1R-like genes are presented in
Additional Figures 2 and 3, respectively.

Results

Neighbor-joining (NJ), maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses of the intact CR gene nucleotide
sequence data set clustered the genes into four well-supported groups, including a group of four V1R-like genes
[see Additional Figure 3], a group of twenty-eight TAAR
that correspond to the 21 intact TAARs reported by
Hashiguchi and Nishida [9], and two well-supported
groups (N = 13 and 14, respectively) of ORs (Figure 2). A
partial OR cDNA assembled from the 454 data
(1681.OR230) mapped to the assembly but was missing
its 5' end in both the genome draft and expressed transcripts. This olfactory receptor gene was excluded from the
neighbor-joining analysis of intact CRs presented here
(Figure 2), but is included in the supplemental material
[see Additional File 1].

Chemosensory Receptor Gene Repertoire

genome contains all three known single-exon CR gene
families. TBLASTN searches of the WGS P. marinus Draft

sequences (contigs) containing potential chemosensory

Two of the predicted intact CR genes from the draft

Our objective is to determine which CR families were
present at the jawless stage of vertebrate evolution and
infer the significance of CR genes in the radiation of vertebrates. We present predicted CR genes from the sea lamprey draft genome and describe their expression as
determined using Roche 454 GS 20 Life Sciences sequencing technology (Figure 2) and RT-PCR (Table 1), in addition to ESTs from the National Center for Biotechnology
Information.

Expression data is shown for a subset of lamprey CR genes, including all OR, TAAR and V1R genes detected by olfactory organ cDNA 454
sequencing. RT-PCR results, primer sequences, annealing temperatures and NCBI EST data are also included. Gonad includes both adult testis and
undifferentiated gonad from parasites. The partial gene 1681.OR230 corresponds to three ESTs (EE739806, EE738866 and EB081557) from adult
olfactory organ*. Two sequences from the NCBI EST database (EG337313 and EG335699) obtained from sea lamprey embryo map to the gene
1268.OR328**. Expression of a calcium-sensing receptor (2008.CASR839) and a metabotropic glutamate receptor (10424.MGR935) were detected
in the olfactory organs of adult sea lamprey. A 540 bp EST represents a cellular nucleic acid binding protein† expressed in both adult olfactory
organ and embryo that was not included in the phylogenetic analysis.

actin releasing hormone receptor, respectively. A singleexon gene (1548.PRH340) in the Petromyzon genome
demonstrates a high degree of homology with the 2-exon
prolactin releasing hormone receptor gene from Danio
rerio (NP_001034615). While the amino acid sequence of
this gene is highly conserved, the exons in the Danio
ortholog are separated by a 29.4 kb intron containing a
predicted pol polyprotein (XP_001343585). These putative neuropeptide receptors were also excluded from the
phylogenetic analysis in Figure 2.
Neighbor-Joining analysis identifies all lamprey singleexon OR genes as clustering most closely to the θ, η, and
κ OR families described by Niimura and Nei [see Additional File 2] [7]. Four intact V1R-like genes
(11722.v1r324,
18775.V1R342,
2061.V1R320,
3717.V1R311) cluster in NJ analysis with recently
described V1R cDNAs in Danio [10,22-24] on the basis of
conserved amino acid residues [see Additional Files 3 and
4]. The presence of these V1R-like genes in lamprey indicates that the V1R gene family arose in chordates before
the divergence of jawed and jawless fish (Figure 1).
An extensive search of the lamprey draft genome failed to
identify likely potential candidates belonging to the
multi-exon V2R gene family. PSI-BLAST searches of the
Petromyzon genome using Danio V2R pheromone receptors as queries returned calcium-sensing receptors and
metabotropic glutamate receptors, but no candidate V2R
genes or V2R pseudogenes. The glutamate and calciumsensing receptors from lamprey clustered most closely in
NJ analysis with V2Rs identified in Danio [see Additional

File 5]. Using TBLASTN and BLASTP to search the
genomes of the echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, the urochodate Ciona and the cephalochordate Branchiostoma with a wide variety of V1R and V2R query
sequences [see Additional File 2] also failed to identify
potential V1R or V2R orthologs in these representative
genomes.
Chemosensory Receptor Gene Expression in Adults and
Parasites
Representatives from all maximum likelihood clusters of
single-exon CR genes were expressed in the olfactory epithelia of adult and parasitic lamprey (Figure 2). Seventeen
of the 59 predicted single-exon CR genes were present in
ESTs assembled from 454 reads. Seven of these 17 receptors detected by 454 sequencing were expressed only in
the olfactory organs of sexually-mature adults, and four
were detected only in the olfactory organ of parasitic-stage
adults (Figure 2). Five receptors were expressed in both
parasites and adults. Three expressed CRs correspond to
the V1R family (2061.V1R320, 3717.V1R311 and
18775.V1R342). No V2R-like genes were detected in the
454 or EST data. Expression of one calcium-sensing receptor and one metabotropic glutamate receptor were
detected in the 454 and EST data (Table 1). Publicly available OR-like EST accessions from NCBI correspond to
ESTs detected using 454 sequencing of olfactory organ
cDNA with the exception of two, EG337313 and
EG335699. These accessions represent a single OR gene
(1268.OR328) that is expressed in sea lamprey embryos,
but was not detected in olfactory tissues of adults and parasites.

454 data from olfactory organ cDNA revealed two potential CR genes that were not predicted from the assembly.
A unique CR gene (1681.OR230) that is expressed in both
adult and parasite olfactory organ corresponds to three
highly similar sequences from the NCBI EST database
(EE739806, EE738866 and EB081557). A putative cellular nucleic acid binding protein (15806.TAP) is also
expressed in embryo and adult olfactory organ. These partial cDNAs were not included in the phylogenetic analysis.
Expression of well-characterized signal transduction cascade components, transient receptor potential cation
channel, guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein),
adenylate cyclase, and phospholipase C were also verified
in the olfactory organ 454 cDNA data.
RT-PCR confirmed tissue-specific expression of
6425.OR330a and 16230.TAAR353, representatives of
two distinct CR families, the ORs and TAARs, respectively
(Figure 3). Expression of 6425.OR330a was restricted to
the olfactory epithelia, testis and undifferentiated parasite
gonads. 16230.TAAR353 was expressed only in the olfactory epithelium. Expression of 6425.OR330a and
16230.TAAR353 were not detectable in brain, liver, gill, or
kidney by RT-PCR. In situ hybridization (ISH) of adult
and larval olfactory epithelia found 6425.OR330a to be
expressed in the ORN (Figure 4). The olfactory epithelium
is visible as a band lining the lamellae radiating from the
wall of the olfactory chamber. The columnar cell body of
ORN expressing the CR genes in adults are located in the
middle layer of the olfactory epithelia (Figure 4C, F).
Within this layer, the positive ORNs were randomly distributed within the olfactory epithelium. Individual CR
probes annealed with 0.8%–2% of the ORNs in lamprey

to this same region. Note that instead of the convolutions
of the adult olfactory lamellae, there is a single layer of
olfactory epithelium covering the olfactory wall in the larval lamprey that also expresses Golf α and 6425.OR330a
(Figure 4). Further, ISH indicated that only 6425.OR330a
and not 16230.TAAR353 was expressed in the interstitial
cells of adult sea lamprey testis (data not shown).
Interestingly, three intact single-exon genes that were
poorly resolved between the OR and the V1R-like receptors in our phylogenetic analyses (1548.PRH340,
3420.CR393, and 5673.OR343) were shown to be
expressed in the brains of both adult and parasitic lamprey by RT-PCR. Transcripts from the predicted prolactin
releasing peptide receptor (1548.PRH340), neuropeptide
FF receptor-like gene (3420.CR393) and a novel OR
(5673.OR343) were detected by RT-PCR in brain but not
olfactory organ, testis or liver from adults and parasites.
RT-PCR results and conditions are summarized in Table 1.

Discussion
The purpose of this study was to identify the repertoire of
chemosensory receptors for olfaction in the sea lamprey
draft genome and infer the evolution of those gene families in the chordate lineage. All known chemosensory
receptors are 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors, but vary considerably in overall sequence and exon
structure, consistent with an ability to recognize diverse
ligands [7]. This study identifies 59 intact single-exon
chemosensory receptor genes in the sea lamprey genome
that belong to three CR families: V1R-like, OR and TAAR
families. These genes share many characteristics of gnathostome single-exon CR genes. Sea lamprey CR genes identified in this study are similar in structure and size to those
described in higher vertebrates [3,4,8]. We found several
contigs that each contain highly homologous members of
the same CR families, which is consistent with findings in
gnathostome genomes where CR genes often cluster in
specific chromosomal regions [8]. Furthermore, of the 59
intact CR genes from our Petromyzon marinus genome
Draft Assembly, we have identified a set of seventeen in
the cDNA from olfactory epithelia of mature and parasitic-stage adult sea lamprey using 454 sequencing. RTPCR and in situ hybridization confirmed that expression
of representative OR and TAAR are largely limited to odorant receptor neurons and testis, which is consistent with
expression of single-exon CR genes in higher vertebrates
[1-3]. The observed life history-specific expression of CR
genes may be adaptive for different olfactory-mediated
behaviours demonstrated in the sea lamprey, as parasites
display search behaviours for detection of prey odor and
adults respond specifically to migratory and mating pheromones [25]. It is likely that the majority of the 59 pre-

dicted intact genes described in this study are functional
CR genes for olfaction in the sea lamprey.
Our data indicate that all three families of single exon CR
genes were present in the most recent common ancestor
of jawless and jawed vertebrates (Figure 1). Both the OR
and TAAR genes are numerous and diverse in the genomes
of sea lamprey and higher vertebrates [7,9], supporting an
expansion prior to the most recent common ancestor of
jawed and jawless vertebrates. Our search for predicted
genes from the draft genomes of Stronglyocentrotus http://
www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/blast.hgsc, Ciona and Branchiostoma http://genome.jgi-psf.org/euk_cur1.html using lamprey gene queries and subsequent phylogenetic analyses
suggest that OR, TAAR and V1R gene families had not
expanded before the rise of vertebrates, and that OR and
V1R receptor families are vertebrate-specific, with TAAR

specific to chordates. This is consistent with findings from
the genomes of the cephalochordate Branchiostoma [11]
and the ascidian Ciona [14], both possessing trace amine
receptors (11 and 14 TAAR, respectively), but neither of
which have been shown to possess V1R pheromone or
olfactory receptors. A recent report has inferred a much
more ancient origin for ORs, placing them in the common
ancestor of vertebrates and cephalochordates, while placing the origin of TAARs in the common ancestor of vertebrates [26]. These results are not in agreement with the
BLAST results presented here, nor with the available
genome-scale analyses of cephalochordates and urochordates [11,14]. A large-scale phylogenetic analysis of available ORs, TAARs and biogenic amine receptors would
address this discrepancy. However, given the expanse of
time involved in the evolution of these ancestral molecules and the striking variation observed within OR and

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:180

TAAR gene families, resolution of these discrepancies may
require more data than BLAST searches, alignments and
phylogenetic inference can provide. Specific ligand-receptor interactions and structural analysis of ligand-binding
domains in these receptors should provide critical data
regarding homology and convergence in the chemosensory receptor repertoires of deuterostomes.
Analysis of the genome of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus has
offered strong evidence of an elaborate chemosensory system in echinoderms [27]. Sea urchin rhodopsin-type
GPCR repertoires indicate that these large chemosensory
receptor subfamilies expanded in echinoderms in a lineage-specific manner and were derived from biogenic
amine receptors [28-30]. Using lamprey TAAR and OR to
query the GLEAN predicted peptides in the Strongylocentrotus genome produced a non-redundant list of 63 serotonin-, octopamine-, histamine and adreno-receptors.
Thirteen of these "best hit" receptors that were identified
as potential TAARs were included in our phylogenetic
analysis. These formed a well-supported clade distinct
from single-exon vertebrate chemosensory genes [see
Additional File 2]. These results support the hypothesis
that chemosensory trace-amine receptors evolved independently at least twice in the deuterostome lineage.
The 28 intact lamprey TAAR genes identified in our study
cluster into a well resolved group, in agreement with the
21 TAAR genes identified from a previous sea lamprey
draft assembly that form a monophyletic clade [9]. Other
than in a few teleost groups, the number of TAAR genes
did not expand dramatically in tetrapods [9]. In contrast,
OR gene repertoires in both teleosts and tetrapods experienced dynamic expansion before and after these two vertebrate groups diverged. The sea lamprey ORs cluster most
closely to the intact η, κ, and θ OR subfamilies described
by Niimura and Nei [7]. These OR subfamilies are represented but not expanded in either teleosts or tetrapods [7].
It is interesting that V1R-like genes, a remarkably diverse
CR family in tetrapods [10], did not expand extensively in
either the sea lamprey or teleost genomes. Sea lamprey
V1R-like genes cluster in NJ analysis with expressed V1R
genes described in Danio [23] [see Additional File 3]. The
presence of V1R-like genes in lamprey and our phylogenetic analysis indicate that this family arose early in the
vertebrate lineage, before the agnathan-gnathostome
divergence (Figure 1), but did not expand dramatically
until vertebrates began exploiting terrestrial habitats [10].
Further, the V1R family likely arose after the separation of
cephalochordate and urochordate lineages which do not
possess identifiable V1R-like sequences in their current
draft genomes. The early divergence of V1R in the vertebrate lineage is further demonstrated by the phylogenetic
signal observed between the lamprey, teleost and mammalian V1Rs [see Additional File 3] and the need to use an

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/180

appropriate protein substitution matrix to detect similar
homologies across greater than 300 million years of evolutionary time [31]. During the successful diversification
in the teleost lineage, the V1R family did not undergo the
dramatic expansions that are observed in the genomes of
terrestrial vertebrates [10], nor did V1R expand during
additional rounds of genome duplication in teleosts [23].
Our results indirectly support a previous study that the
V1R family expanded when vertebrates adapted to the terrestrial environment [10].
The most surprising, and arguably the most interesting,
results from this study are the lack of V2R-like sequences
identifiable from the currently available genomic
resources for the sea lamprey. The V2R family is believed
to encode receptors for detection of water borne compounds [8,10]. This family is characterized by rapid gene
turnover and lineage specific phylogenetic clustering [8],
and is most expanded in fish and frogs [10]. We anticipated that this family would be represented and expanded
in the lamprey genome. Our search for potential V2R
orthologs in the current sea lamprey draft genome, and
those of other groups [11,13,14], did not produce an
identifiable full or partial V2R candidate, nor were any
V2R-like transcripts found in olfactory organ EST library
(18,815 transcripts), filtered 454 sequences (373,391
transcripts) from adult and parasite olfactory organ, or in
the NCBI Trace database for lamprey (19,177,230 traces).
It is also not likely that our search parameters were too
stringent, as our queries using V2R sequences returned
metabotropic glutamate receptors (2 intact genes, 13
pseudogenes) and calcium sensing receptors (2 intact
genes) that are most similar to known V2R receptors.
Additionally, searches of urochordate and cephalochordate genomes for potential V2R genes have identified no
putative V2R sequences [11,14]. These results from urochordate, cephalochordate, and the current sea lamprey
draft genomes, as well as olfactory organ transcriptome
data suggest that the V2R gene family arose and diversified
in the lineage leading to teleosts after the separation of
jawed and jawless vertebrates. This provides evidence
regarding the timing of the V2R expansion and its' potential role in the successful radiation of the modern vertebrate lineage.
The limited repertoire of CR genes in the lamprey genome, in
both the number of gene families and the restricted degree of
expansion in each CR family, accounts for the limited
number of odorants that are detected by lamprey. The 59
intact CR genes described in this study likely represent a large
portion of the complete CR repertoire of sea lamprey, for two
reasons. Extensive and stringent alignment and mapping
analysis using lamprey ESTs indicate that the assembled contiguous sequences represent a minimum of 76 percent of the
sea lamprey genome. The majority of lamprey ESTs that do
not map to the assembly appear to be non-coding RNAs
Page 9 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:180

from those same repetitive regions that have confounded
efforts to assemble larger scaffolds. Moreover, the CR transcripts detected in olfactory organ cDNA by 454 sequencing
analysis all mapped to the draft genome, suggesting that
76% coverage provides a cautious estimate for coverage of
CR families. Therefore, the complete sea lamprey CR repertoire is likely much smaller than those of teleost fish and
tetrapods. Electrophysiological studies indicate that the sea
lamprey can detect all of the classes of odorants that are
detected by teleosts [18]; the actual number of individual
odorant compounds within each odorant class that are
detectable by the sea lamprey, however, is much reduced
[18].
The lack of identifiable V2R homologs in the sea lamprey
genome provides a perspective on development of CR
early in the vertebrate lineage that leads to the dynamic
and vagile life histories that characterize modern vertebrates. Similar to cephalochordates and urochordates, all
extant agnathan species spend the largest portion of their
life cycles, or their entire life, amongst the benthos. The
diversification of CR genes in jawed vertebrates, including
the advent of the V2R gene family, likely corresponded to
an increased ability in ancient vertebrates to locate food
and mates while exploiting novel habitats and avoiding
potential threats. In retrospect, this was one of several critical early developments in our lineage that lead ultimately
to the diversity of modern vertebrates.

Conclusion
Analysis of available sea lamprey genome data has identified a minimum of 59 intact single-exon chemosensory
receptor genes. These GPCRs are homologous to the olfactory receptors, trace amine-associated receptors and V1R
pheromone receptors described in higher vertebrates.
Expression of seventeen of these receptors has been
detected in the olfactory organs of mating- and parasiticphase lamprey by 454 sequencing and confirmed by RTPCR. RT-PCR further indicates that more of these CRs are
expressed at relatively low levels in the olfactory epithelia.
In situ hybridization for representative TAAR and OR
genes in olfactory epithelium demonstrates this expression occurs specifically in the olfactory receptor neurons
of adult lamprey. These results provide strong support for
the majority of these genes functioning in the sensory epithelium of the olfactory system. The presence of these
gene families in the sea lamprey genome also suggests that
the advent of OR, TAAR and V1R gene families had
occurred before the divergence of jawed and jawless vertebrates.

Methods
Parasitic and Adult Lamprey
Adult sea lampreys were collected from tributaries to lakes
Huron and Michigan by the staff of the U. S. Fish and
Wildlife Service (Marquette Biological Station, Marquette,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/180

Michigan, USA). Parasitic sea lampreys were captured in
Lake Huron attached to fish caught by commercial and
recreational anglers and were collected by the staff of U.S.
Geological Survey Hammond Bay Biological Station
(Millersburg, Michigan). The animals were transported to
Michigan State University and held in flow-through tanks
supplied with chilled, aerated well water (5°C).
Tissue Collection
Olfactory epithelium, brain, liver, kidney, gills and
gonads were collected for study. Tissues were immediately
placed in liquid nitrogen for DNA and RNA preparation.
Olfactory organs were dissected to include the accessory
olfactory organ that is immediately adjacent and posterior
to main olfactory epithelia. Tissues for cryosectioning
were embedded in Tissue Tek O.C.T compound (Sakura
Finetek, Torrance, CA) after fixation by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.5.
Genome Assembly
Whole Genome Shotgun assembly of the sea lamprey
(Petromyzon marinus) genome was undertaken with
sequence data generated by the Washington University
Genome Sequencing Center (WUGSC). A total of
18,787,613 sequence reads deposited in the NCBI Trace
Archive were downloaded; 382,756 were excluded from
the assembly for various reasons. The average read length
was 660 nucleotides which yields a total input of
12,147,205,620 nucleotides. Genome coverage is
between 5.9 and 9.3X depending on the estimated
genome size. 93% of the input reads were paired. The
assembly was performed with the Arachne WGS assembly
program (v3) written at the Broad Institute and was carried out on the Michigan State University High Performance Computing Center (MSU HPCC) Silicon Graphics
Altix 3700 BX2. Total running time for the assembly was
494 hours, 38 minutes (20.6 days). Including computer
downtime and repeating select steps of the assembly the
total time required was approximately 30 days. To estimate the degree of genome coverage a total of 90,955 ESTs
were mapped to the draft 2 assembly with the program
BLAT [32] using stringent alignment parameters (minimum score = 400, minimum identity = 98%). 61,904
ESTs (70%) mapped to this assembly. These ESTs had previously been clustered using stackPACK [33] which generated 9,649 multisequence consensi from 65,029 ESTs. The
other 22,833 remained as singletons. These 32,482
unique sequences were also mapped to the new draft,
19,056 aligned to the assembly; these 19,056 represent
66,738 ESTs (76% of the total).
Prediction of Chemosensory Receptor Genes
Candidate odorant receptor gene sequences were identified in the WGS Petromyzon marinus Draft Assembly
(Draft v.2, 2007-02) and the NCBI Trace database http://

the gene identification process is provided [see Additional
File 6]. TBLASTN http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST
searches were used to identify intact olfactory genes in sea
lamprey using known olfactory receptor, trace amineassociated receptor, and pheromone receptor amino acid
sequences as queries [Additional File 7]. Contiguous
sequences producing alignment hits (E-values < 1 × 10-10)
were added to a non-redundant list of queries and searching continued in this manner until no new contig hits
were found in the assembly. Genes were predicted using
GENSCAN http://genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html[34] and
predicted amino acid sequences (>200 aa) were tentatively identified by batch BLASTP searches against the
non-redundant (nr) NCBI Protein database. 7-transmembrane domains were confirmed using Phobius http://pho
bius.cbr.su.se/ and TMHMM Server v. 2.0 http://
www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/. Gene names are
composed of supercontig numbers from the genome draft
assembly, followed by gene family designation and initial
predicted amino acid length.

from lamprey were analyzed alongside Danio, Takifugu
and higher vertebrate V2R, CASR and MGR amino acid
sequences (n = 86) by neighbor-joining to detect possible
clustering of V2R orthologs [Additional File 5] [35,36].
Similar phylogenetic analyses were conducted with lamprey OR and TAAR genes (n = 55, Figure 2), lamprey and
vertebrate V1R genes (n = 25, see Additional File 3) and
vertebrate OR and TAAR genes with best-hit predicted
genes from Stronglyocentrotus (n = 204, see Additional File
2). To provide evolutionary context for the predicted CR
repertoire in sea lamprey, functional representatives from
nine vertebrate olfactory receptor (OR) families representing both Class I and II OR as described by Niimura and
Nei [7] were also included in this phylogenetic analyses.

Phylogenetic Analysis
Predicted lamprey CR genes were included for analysis if
they possessed start and stop codons, a complete 7-transmembrane domain, and an open reading frame ≥690
nucleotides. CR-like sequences not meeting these criteria
were considered pseudogenes. Sequences identified by
BLASTP as G-coupled protein receptors that were not
potential CR genes, i.e., GABA-receptors, muscarinic acid
receptors, and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors, were
excluded from the analysis.

Preparation of cDNAs for 454 sequencing
cDNA was prepared from pooled olfactory organ RNA
from sexually mature female sea lamprey (n = 5) and both
male and female parasitic-stage sea lamprey (n = 5, 3
females). Olfactory organ epithelial tissue was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until extraction. Total RNA was extracted using Perfect Pure RNA
Tissue Kit (5 Prime, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. The quality of the extracted RNA
was verified by gel electrophoresis and RNA concentration
was quantified using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. 1 ug of total RNA was used as a template for first
strand cDNA synthesis using the SMART™ cDNA Synthesis
Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). 13 cycles of LD-PCR was
performed to amplify single-strand cDNA using the
Advantage® 2 PCR Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.)
according to manufacturer's instructions. PCR products
were purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Inc) and concentrated on Millipore YM-30 (MWCO
30,000) columns. 5200 ng of cDNA were submitted to the
Research Technology Support Facility at Michigan State
University for Roche 454 GS 20 sequencing.

Multiple amino acid and nucleotide data sets were assembled to evaluate the overall topologies of the predicted
gene trees in the context of other lineages with relevant
estimated divergence times. BLASTN searches of the Ciona
intestinalis v2.0 and Branchiostoma floridaev1.0 draft
genomes were performed locally using a representative list
of predicted odorant receptors from lamprey in addition
to published V1R and V2R from Danio and Rattus. Putative Ciona and Branchiostoma pheromone receptor, TAAR
and OR sequences were obtained by TBLASTN and
TBLASTX searches of the most recent draft genomes available from the Joint Genome Institute http://genome.jgipsf.org/euk_cur1.html using lamprey CR queries.
Searches were also performed of both databases using teleost, sea urchin, and mammalian pheromone receptor
sequences as queries. Searches for potential echinoderm
CR gene orthologs were carried out using lamprey CRs as
BLAST queries against the Strongylocentrotus purpuratus
GLEAN3 gene predictions available at the Baylor College
of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center http://
www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/blast.hgsc.
Predicted protein sequences of Ca++-sensing receptors
(CASR) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (MGR)

Neighbor-joining trees were constructed using MEGA4
[35,36]. Amino acid sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL V [37], alignment gaps and missing data were eliminated only in pairwise sequence comparisons, and
distances were computed using the JTT protein matrix,.

Bioinformatics processing of cDNA reads generated by
Roche 454 GS 20
The TIGR SeqClean1 sequence trimming pipeline was
used to remove low quality, low complexity, polyA and
adapter sequences from the cDNA sequences prior to any
analyses. Sequences were aligned to the draft genome
assembly (Draft v.2, 2007-02) using BLAT2 [32]and resulting alignments were further filtered using the associated
pslSort and pslReps tools. The stringent filtering threshold
was set for 95% sequence identity and 90% coverage of
the cDNA sequence.

Clustering and consensus assembly of the cDNA
sequences was performed using the TIGR Gene Indices
clustering tools (TGICL) [38]. Clusters may be generated
ab-initio or by using known full or partial cDNA
sequences to "seed" the clustering. Two complete 454
runs were performed. After screening for vector, low complexity, low quality sequences, these runs resulted in a
total of 373,391 high quality reads with an average read
length of 93 nucleotides. This resulted in a total read
length of 35,035,388 nucleotides and a total unique
length of 10,420,310 nucleotides that were mapped to the
assembly. The NJ tree (Figure 2) includes 454 expression
data for lamprey OR and TAAR. Table 1 summarizes the
available CR expression data.
RT-PCR Amplification of Predicted Odorant Receptor
Genes
To analyze tissue-specific expression of CR genes, primers
designed from predicted CR gene sequences were used to
perform RT-PCR on RNA samples extracted from different
sea lamprey tissues (liver, brain, testis, kidney and gill) of
adult and parasitic phases. One μg total RNA from each
tissue was reverse-transcribed using oligo (dT) primers.
The resulting cDNA was subjected to PCR using the genespecific primers. A partial β-actin sequence was amplified
from the same cDNA template as a positive control. The
PCR cycling parameters are as follows: 45 sec. at 94°C, 45
sec. at 52–58°C, 45 sec. at 72°C; 35 cycles; and final step:
10 min. at 72°C. PCR products were visualized on a 1%
agarose gel by ethidium bromide staining. Results for
6425.OR330 and 16230.TAAR353 are shown in Figure 3.
RT-PCR results, primer sequences and annealing temperatures are shown in Table 1.
Synthesis of Digoxigenin- labelled cRNA Probes
Digoxigenin labelled antisense RNA probes were generated from sea lamprey OR clones using the Riboprobe In
vitro Transcription System (Promega). Golf mRNAs are
expressed specifically in odorant receptors neurons [39],
and because immunoreactive Golf are widely distributed in
odorant receptor neurons of both larval and adult sea
lampreys [40], a positive control probe was generated
from a Golf cDNA clone kindly provided by Dr. R. Reed
(Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). In brief, 2 μg
linearized vector were transcribed in the presence of 700
nmol digoxigenin-11-UTP. The cRNA was collected by
ethanol precipitation and resuspended in DEPC water.
The sense RNA was prepared by a similar procedure and
used as the negative control.
Tissue Preparation
Olfactory rosettes dissected from adult, parasite and larval
lamprey and testis dissected from adult sea lamprey were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde PBS solution for 3 h. Fol-

lowing cryoprotection in 25% sucrose buffer overnight at
room temperature, the tissues were embedded in Tissue
Tek O.C.T compound and rapidly frozen in -80°C. Cross
sections of 12 μm were cut using Leica1850 cryostat at 25°C, adhered to Superfrost plus microslides (Fisher Scientific; Orangeburg, NY) and stored at -80°C.
Hybridization
Tissue sections were brought to room temperature, treated
with proteinase K (20 μg/ml in PBS) for 5 min and post
fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS solution.
Sections were rinsed three times for 10 min. each in PBS
before a 2 h incubation in prehybridization solution
[50% deionized formamide, 1× Denhart's solution, 750
mM sodium chloride, 25 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA), 25 mM piperazine-N,N'-bis (2-ethanesulfonic acid; PIPES), 0.25 mg/ml calf thymus DNA, 0.25
mg/ml Poly A acid and 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS)]. Sections were then hybridized with antisense or
sense RNA probe in hybridization solution (prehybridization solution containing 5% dextran sulfate) at 60°C for
16–20 h. After hybridization, sections were washed three
times for 10 min each in 2×SSC with 0.3% polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate (Tween-20) followed by three
washes in 0.2×SSC with 0.3% Tween-20 at 65°C.
Immunovisualization of Digoxigenin
For detection of digoxigenin-labeled probes, the sections
were blocked for 1 h in 4% dry milk, 2% bovine albumin
and 0.3% triton. The sections were incubated for 3 h with
alkaline phosphatatase-conjugated sheep anti-digoxigenin Fab fragments, 1:1000 in blocking solution (Boehringer Mannheim; Indianapolis, IN). The color was
developed with incubation in nitroblue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3 indolyl phosphate substrate
(NBT/BCIP, Boehringer Mannheim) for 20–30 min. Sections were mounted in DPX Mountant.
