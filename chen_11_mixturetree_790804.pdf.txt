MixtureTree: a program for constructing
phylogeny
Shu-Chuan Chen1*, Michael S Rosenberg2 and Bruce G Lindsay3

Abstract
Background: MixtureTree v1.0 is a Linux based program (written in C++) which implements an algorithm based
on mixture models for reconstructing phylogeny from binary sequence data, such as single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs). In addition to the mixture algorithm with three different optimization options, the program
also implements a bootstrap procedure with majority-rule consensus.
Results: The MixtureTree program written in C++ is a Linux based package. The User’s Guide and source codes
will be available at http://math.asu.edu/~scchen/MixtureTree.html
Conclusions: The efficiency of the mixture algorithm is relatively higher than some classical methods, such as
Neighbor-Joining method, Maximum Parsimony method and Maximum Likelihood method. The shortcoming of
the mixture tree algorithms, for example timing consuming, can be improved by implementing other revised
Expectation-Maximization(EM) algorithms instead of the traditional EM algorithm.

Background
Methods for constructing a phylogeny given a set of the
DNA sequences is always a popular topic in both biological and statistical research. Many classical methods are
popular, such as Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method, Maximum Parsimony (MP) method, Maximum Likelihood
(ML) method, and Bayesian (MCMC) approaches ([1]
and [2]). There are also many programs which implement these methods, including PHYLIP [3], PAUP [4],
and MEGA [5]. Chen and Lindsay introduced a mixture
likelihood algorithm as a novel and natural way to deal
with such problems because the distribution of offsprings’ sequence is a mixture of parental distributions
[6]. Unlike the classic methods, this approach uses the
frequencies of each sequence within the population to
help reconstructing the phylogeny from binary
sequences. The model proposed by Chen and Lindsay
[6] was done mathematically, as a first step, and that it
should not be particularly problematic with most SNPs
are bi-allelic with only a very small proportion (well less
than 1% and probably less than 0.1%) tri-allelic or quadallelic ([7] and [8]). The algorithm uses a K-component

bernoulli mixture to model binary sequences. It is wellknown that when the parameter takes values in an infinite dimensional space, the maximum likelihood estimation often fails. To overcome the above issue, we can
first maximize over a constrained subspace of the parameter space then relax the constraint as the sample size
grows. In this case, the maximum likelihood estimation
will then work. The parameter used to create a constrained subspace is called a sieve parameter [9]. In our
case, the sieve parameter is the mutation rate p which is
considered as a function of time in the mixture model.
By varying p from 0 to 0.5, the mixture algorithm can
give an estimate of the recent common ancestors of the
given sequences. In order to obtain the mixture tree of
the observed sequences, the Expectation-Maximization
(EM) algorithm is employed. To overcome the small
weights (π) problem in the regular EM, the nature way
comes up is that we do not update the weights π. Such
an algorithm, we call it FixEM. The Modal EM is a nonparametric statistical approach to clustering via mode
identification in the Bernoulli mixtures ([10] and [11]).
The MixtureTree program contains the regular EM
algorithm plus these two related optimization algorithms, Fixed EM (FixEM) algorithm and Modal EM
(ModalEM) algorithm. Any and all can be chosen to
estimate the ancestral sequences. We have found that

the FixEM and ModalEM algorithms have better computational efficiency over the regular EM algorithm [11].
After constructing the phylogeny, it is common for
researchers to carry out a nonparametric bootstrap analysis ([12,13], and [14]) in which one creates bootstrap
samples from the empirical distribution of sites from
the original sequence data. The MixtureTree algorithm
also implements a majority-rule consensus tree method
from PHYLIP. This method is originally proposed by
Margush and McMorris [15] and also allows one to
easily find the strict consensus tree.

Implementation
The input function in the MixtureTree program can
read DNA sequences in a simple tabular format, in
which all the sequences should be stacked in the form:
Sequence Name Sequence Sequence’ s Frequency
The parameters setting can be changed in the parameter file. Three different optimization options can be
chosen in the algorithm. The output function of the
program writes the estimated mixture tree in the commonly-used Newick format which can be read, viewed,
and manipulated by many other programs. Whether the
EM algorithm converges can be checked in the output
file em.txt. If chosen as an option, the bootstrap trees
will also be output in Newick format. The summary of
the bootstrap trees will be in a separate le. All of the
output trees can be easily imported into other packages,
such as the R package APE for further manipulations.
Details can be found in the UserGuide at http://math.

Results and Discussion
In order to evaluate the efficiency of the MixtureTree
algorithm, we generated a sample of size 200 by using
the simulator ms ([16]) with five lineages in each sample unit. The simulator generates the true phylogeny
along with the lineages, so we reconstruct the mixture
tree, Neighbor-Joining tree and Maximum Parsimony
tree based on the simulated lineages and then compare
them with the true tree by using the Robinson and
Foulds metric ([17]). The metric proposed by Robinson
and Foulds ([17]) is based on elementary operations on
transforming one tree to another tree in order to compare two tree topologies. By comparing the distances of
trees, we can make conclusion of tree A is closer to
tree B rather than to tree C. For each simulation we
also calculate the distances among the Mixture tree,
Neighbor-Joining tree, Maximum Parsimony tree and
Maximum Likelihood tree then we sum over the distances from those 200 simulations. In the simulation
study, we simulated 200 sets of sequences using various
mutation rates. For each set of sequences the length of
the sequences was 10 SNPs and the number of lineages

Page 2 of 3

was 5. With small mutation rates, we received very
similar results. For example, with mutation rate
0.00000375 the sum of the distances of these 200 simulations for MixtureTree, NJ tree, MP tree, and ML tree
are 168, 208, 194 and 328. The three methods, except
ML tree, were about as different from each other as
they were from the true tree, showing that the new
mixture tree method is fundamentally different from the
other two. The sum of the pairwise distances of Mixture
v.s. NJ, Mixture v.s. MP, NJ v.s. MP, Mixture v.s. ML,
NJ v.s. ML, MP v.s. ML are 180, 192, 180, 292, 346, 334
and shows that the performance of MixtureTree is closer to NJ tree. The results are presented using histograms in Figure 1.

Conclusions
From the comparison above, we can see that the efficiency of the mixture algorithm is relatively higher than
the other three methods. However, there are also some
shortcomings of the mixture algorithm, for example, it
is more time-consuming to obtain the phylogeny than
the other two methods. This shortcoming can be solved
by implementing the Fixed EM or Modal EM instead of
the traditional EM algorithm.
