Abstract
Background: Human genetic diversity observed in Indian subcontinent is second only to that of
Africa. This implies an early settlement and demographic growth soon after the first 'Out-of-Africa'
dispersal of anatomically modern humans in Late Pleistocene. In contrast to this perspective,
linguistic diversity in India has been thought to derive from more recent population movements and
episodes of contact. With the exception of Dravidian, which origin and relatedness to other
language phyla is obscure, all the language families in India can be linked to language families spoken
in different regions of Eurasia. Mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome evidence has supported
largely local evolution of the genetic lineages of the majority of Dravidian and Indo-European
speaking populations, but there is no consensus yet on the question of whether the Munda (Austro-

Asiatic) speaking populations originated in India or derive from a relatively recent migration from
further East.
Results: Here, we report the analysis of 35 novel complete mtDNA sequences from India which
refine the structure of Indian-specific varieties of haplogroup R. Detailed analysis of haplogroup R7,
coupled with a survey of ~12,000 mtDNAs from caste and tribal groups over the entire Indian
subcontinent, reveals that one of its more recently derived branches (R7a1), is particularly frequent
among Munda-speaking tribal groups. This branch is nested within diverse R7 lineages found among
Dravidian and Indo-European speakers of India. We have inferred from this that a subset of Mundaspeaking groups have acquired R7 relatively recently. Furthermore, we find that the distribution of
R7a1 within the Munda-speakers is largely restricted to one of the sub-branches (Kherwari) of
northern Munda languages. This evidence does not support the hypothesis that the Austro-Asiatic
speakers are the primary source of the R7 variation. Statistical analyses suggest a significant
correlation between genetic variation and geography, rather than between genes and languages.
Conclusion: Our high-resolution phylogeographic study, involving diverse linguistic groups in
India, suggests that the high frequency of mtDNA haplogroup R7 among Munda speaking
populations of India can be explained best by gene flow from linguistically different populations of
Indian subcontinent. The conclusion is based on the observation that among Indo-Europeans, and
particularly in Dravidians, the haplogroup is, despite its lower frequency, phylogenetically more
divergent, while among the Munda speakers only one sub-clade of R7, i.e. R7a1, can be observed.
It is noteworthy that though R7 is autochthonous to India, and arises from the root of hg R, its
distribution and phylogeography in India is not uniform. This suggests the more ancient
establishment of an autochthonous matrilineal genetic structure, and that isolation in the
Pleistocene, lineage loss through drift, and endogamy of prehistoric and historic groups have greatly
inhibited genetic homogenization and geographical uniformity.

Background
More than one sixth of humanity currently lives on the
Indian subcontinent. This population is spread across up
to 40,000 endogamous and semi-endogamous culturally,
linguistically, and socially differentiated groups [1]. The
majority of these groups or populations are castes, but
they also include nearly 500 'scheduled tribes' [2] and ca.
500 'scheduled castes' [3]. Thus, the Indian subcontinent
is an ideal region for studying the relationships between
culture, geography and genes, and for developing interdisciplinary models concerning the demographic history of
Homo sapiens or anatomically modern humans (AMH).
Moreover, the large number of deep-rooting mtDNA lineages emerging from the basal nodes of both superhaplogroup M and N (including R) [4-11] indicate that the
Indian subcontinent was probably the first major outcome of the dispersals of AMH from Africa. Furthermore,
these deep-rooted mtDNA haplogroups generally cross
cultural and social boundaries; this suggests a common
origin to the highly diverse peoples of the Indian sub-continent, with indigenous or autochthonous diversification
of the maternal gene pool [12-16].
These results have been generally corroborated by data
from the Y chromosome [17,18] and autosomal DNA
[13,19,20]. The only exception, for mtDNA, are the
Tibeto-Burman speakers of north-eastern India, who

share about half of their maternal genetic heritage with
populations living further east of India [14,21]. It has
been argued, that following the initial colonization of
Indian subcontinent, maternal gene flow from the west
has been rather limited and largely restricted to the western states of contemporary India and Pakistan [14,15,22].
Consequently, the haplogroup richness of the Indian subcontinent appears to have formed in situ, and date back to
some point in the later Pleistocene, most probably
between 40 Ka and 60 Ka ago. Furthermore, this high level
of genetic diversity may also be linked to the possibility
that the South Asian population in the Pleistocene was
demographically large in global terms. Comparisons of
relative regional population sizes through time, deduced
by Bayesian coalescent inference methods applied to global mtDNA complete sequence data, indicate that
between approximately 45 Ka and 20 Ka ago most of
humanity lived in Southern Asia [23].
Two language families, Indo-European and Dravidian,
account for the majority of linguistic diversity in India.
However, apart from a number of linguistic isolates, there
are two other major families – Tibeto-Burman and AustroAsiatic (AA). The origin of the Austro-Asiatic language
family is a highly debated issue. Building on archaeological and linguistic evidence, and the assumption that rice
domestication was a single event, the currently preferred

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/227

hypothesis places the origin of this language family in
Southeast Asia [24-26]. The alternative model, based on
genetic evidence (that shows multiple domestications of
rice varieties [27]), and comparative phonology, advocates an East Indian cradle for the AA language group [28].
The AA language family tree has two basic branches –
Munda and Mon-Khmer. The former is distributed exclusively in the Indian subcontinent; the latter is predominantly Southeast Asian, although there are a few Indian
representatives (Khasian and Nicobarese) [26].

and northwest Eurasia [14]. Here we have now extended
the complete mtDNA sequencing by determining 35 new
complete sequences, in order to further refine the phylogeny of the Indian subcontinent-specific segment of haplogroup R. Furthermore, to explore the correlations between
genes, languages and geography in Indian subcontinent,
we have carried out high resolution genotyping and phylogeographic detailed analyses on R7, which occurs at high
frequency among the Austro-Asiatic (Munda) speaking
groups of India.

The genetic origin(s) of extant AA speakers, however, may
or may not coincide with the origin of the language group.
Studies of mtDNA diversity have shown that the AA
speakers from Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent
carry mtDNAs of different sources [7,9,14,16,29,30].
Although the data on Southeast Asian populations, which
speak languages of the Mon-Khmer branch of the AA tree,
are still somewhat limited, it seems safe to conclude, that
their mtDNA characteristics are similar to those of the surrounding Southeast Asian populations, and distinct from
AA tribes of India (Munda-speakers) [30]. Similarly, the
Indian tribes speaking different Munda languages show
generally the same mtDNA haplogroup composition as
the Indo European and Dravidic groups of India
[9,14,16,29]. In contrast, the Y chromosomes of Indian
and Southeast Asian AA speaking populations share a
common marker, M95, which defines a single branch
(O2a) in the overwhelmingly East Asian specific tree of
haplogroup O. This evidence provides a strong basis for
proposing a Southeast Asian origin of the paternal lineages of the Munda speaking populations of India
[13,17,18].

Results and Discussion

The AA speaking populations of Myanmar, which is a
likely dispersal route, or original location, for the ancestral populations of Munda speakers of India, have not yet
been sampled for their mtDNA. It is still possible that
some of the mtDNA clades present among the AA speakers of India (and in their neighbours) could, in fact, be
due to gene flow to India from further east. In an attempt
to identify mtDNA lineages that would reveal a phylogeographic distribution similar to that of the Y chromosome
marker M95, we analyzed mtDNA samples representing
all the major linguistic groups of India, with a particular
focus to haplogroup R derived lineages.
The first thorough study of complete mtDNA sequences
from India [4] identified numerous indigenous clades
emerging directly from the roots of superhaplogroups N,
R and U, such as N5, R5-R8, R30, R31, U2a-d and U7.
West Eurasian specific haplogroups HV, JT, N1, and U
(xU2a-d, U7) occur at lower frequencies, suggesting limited but phylogeographically well detectable gene flow
into the Indian subcontinent, most probably from west

The inclusion of our 35 novel sequences (Table 1) into the
phylogeny of haplogroup R allows the recognition of
eight new subclades within six haplogroup R branches
unique to the Indian subcontinent (Fig. 1, [see Additional
file 1]). We refine here the internal topology of haplogroups R5, R6 and R8, and describe two novel sub-clades
of hg R7, to be discussed below in detail. Subclade R5a is
defined by a deletion at nucleotide positions (np) 522–
523 and one control region mutation at np16266. R6a is
defined by two control region substitutions (at sites
16129 and 16266). In haplogroup R7, two new subclades
R7a and R7b can be identified (for details see further
down). A new subclade of R8, called R8a, is defined by a
single coding region substitution at np 5510. Haplogroup
R30 splits into two subclades R30a and R30b, the former
supported by ten coding region substitutions and the latter by 24 coding and control region mutations. Similarly,
in haplogroup R31 a new subclade R31a can be distinguished by 17 control and coding region mutations. Coalescent estimates suggest an ancient branching pattern in
hgs R30 and R31, dating back almost to the earliest diversification of the superhaplogroup R itself. This most probably occurred soon after the out of Africa dispersals into
the Indian subcontinent [see Additional file 1].
Comparison of patterns of haplogroup distribution in
relation to linguistic groups reveals that the frequency of
the R7 clade is several times greater among AA (Munda)
speakers than among Dravidian and Indo-European
speaking populations (Table 2, [see Additional file 2]).
Geographically, the distribution of R7 in India is centered
on the AA "heartland" (Bihar, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh) [see Additional file 3]. Similar to R7, haplogroup R6
is significantly more frequent among the AA speakers than
among other linguistic groups (Table 2, [see Additional
file 2]). PC analysis based on frequency data of the hg R
subclades confirms that the majority of Munda speaking
populations cluster separately from others mainly because
of higher hg R7 frequency (Fig. 2). However, only 50.6%
of the variation can be explained by the first two principal
components. Interestingly, hg R6 is placed within the
main cluster, which is comprised of populations from all

among IE and Dravidian-speaking populations of Indian
subcontinent.

In general, the elevated frequency of hg R7 among the AA
speakers of India can be explained by two alternative scenarios. Firstly, one may consider a possible origin of R7
among AA (Munda) speakers, possibly already outside
India. Under this scenario the presence of R7 in some Dravidian and Indo-European speaking communities would
be explained by its later introgression from the Munda
communities, or by language shift of some Munda speaking groups into Dravidian/Indo-European languages. Secondly, an origin of R7 may lie among non-AA populations
of India, with the presently observable higher frequency
of R7 among AA resulting from founder effect(s) due to
random genetic drift. To test these two scenarios, we carried out a detailed analysis of R7 mtDNAs in populations
speaking different subgroups of AA languages, as well as

Complete mtDNA sequence-based topology of hg R7
divulges two deep-rooted subclades (Fig. 1). R7a is
defined by four and R7b by six coding region mutations
and, in addition, by two control-region substitutions (146
and 16311). We calculated the time to the most recent
common ancestor (MRCA) for all R7 major sub-clades
(Fig. 1 and 3, Table 3), applying different calibration
methods [30,31]. All the AA individuals coalesce to the
founder R7a1 that dates back to between approximately 3
Ka and 7 Ka ago, depending on the mutation rate used.
The coalescent times of R7 variation among Dravidians
and Indo-Europeans are older. In other words, the only R7
lineage found by us in AA speakers of India – R7a1 – is
nested within the R7 lineages found among Dravidian
and Indo-European speakers of India (Table 3).

Geographically, the distribution of R7a frequency is concentrated towards Bihar, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh
States, while R7b has its frequency peak in AndhraPradesh (Fig. 4a and 4b). The frequency of R7a is higher
among AA (Munda) speakers, while R7b is most common
among Dravidian speakers from Andhra-Pradesh,
although the overall frequency of R7b is much lower than
that of R7a (Fig. 4c and 4d). A Mantel test showed a significant correlation between genes and geography for the
Indian R sub-clades, but no such correlation for the relationship between genes and languages (Table 4). The spatial autocorrelation analysis favoured a clinal pattern for
the distribution of hg R7 [see Additional file 4]. At the

local (i.e. district) level, R7 is present in Bihar, Jharkhand,
Chhattisgarh, Madhya-Pradesh and the northern districts
of Andhra-Pradesh (Adilabad, Warangal and Khammam),
whereas elsewhere in India it is virtually absent, including
among other AA groups inhabiting Orissa and Maharashtra states [see Additional file 5].
The overall higher than average frequency of R7 among
the AA speakers of India may superficially be seen as supporting the model that places the origin of this haplogroup among AA speakers, possibly even outside India,
assuming the language phylum would have arisen elsewhere. Indirectly, such a scenario would be also sup-

The frequency distribution of R7a and R7b clades in Indian subcontinent
The frequency distribution of R7a and R7b clades in Indian subcontinent. The upper panel (a, b) shows the spatial
distribution (%) of these clades in Indian populations. Isofrequency maps were generated by using Surfer7 of Golden Software
(Golden Software Inc., Golden, Colorado), following the Kriging procedure. These isofrequency maps illustrate the geographic
spread of the respective mtDNA haplogroups. It should be cautioned, however, that these illustrative maps should not be used
to predict the frequency of the clade in geographical areas with missing data. The lower panel (c, d) depicts the frequencies of
R7a and R7b in different social and language groups. DRA-Dravidian, AA-Austro-Asiatic, IE-Indo-European.

haplogroup via local admixture, together with the rest of
the South Asian mtDNA lineages that make up their
extant maternal lineage pool. Furthermore, the presence
of only a single recent founder branch of R7, i.e. R7a1,
among widely dispersed AA populations of India supports
the founder event scenario by introgression of this lineage
from the local non-AA populations before the range
expansion of Munda speaking populations within India.
If indeed R7 did have its origin among some so far unsampled populations of the present-day Myanmar or Cambodia, we would then expect to see different sub-divided AA
populations losing by drift different sub-branches of R7a
and R7b (to explain their reduced diversity), and the
admixed Dravidian and Indo-European speaking populations would be expected to have obtained a subset of the
R7 variation observed in AA speakers, which is not the
case. While the occurrence of R7a1 among Dravidian and
Indo-European-speaking populations living close to the
AA populations (Fig. 3) could be explained by language
shift or secondary admixture with AA speakers, sub-haplogroup R7b appears to be restricted to Dravidian-speakers
of the southern part of India (Fig. 4b and 4d). Nevertheless, this haplogroup is also reported in two Indo-European populations (Kolcha and Rathwa) whose local
tradition speaks about their ancient split from the Gond
(Gondi subfamily of Dravidian language group) population of Central India and further migration to Gujarat.
Thus, from the data and analyses shown here, it is most
parsimonious to conjecture that R7 originated in India
among non-AA, possibly in Dravidian speaking populations.
To test further the two hypotheses, a Dravidian origin for
R7 with admixture and founder effects, versus an external
AA origin of R7, we examined whether the spread of R7
among the different Munda sub-groups in India, as
defined by the language trees [26,27], is uniform. This
would be expected if R7 was present among the ancestral
AA speakers prior to the diversification of the language
family into numerous branches. Consistent with the nonAA origin of R7, we found the distribution of R7a1 among
AA populations to be profoundly skewed towards the
Kherwari sub-branch of the North Munda languages
which accounts for ~90% of the AA R7 samples (Fig. 5).
Conversely, R7 is very rare in the South Munda group. It
is completely absent in Koraput Munda speakers and marginally present only in the Kharia tribe of Madhya Pradesh
(in total 3 out of 431 South Munda samples) (Fig. 5). This
finding yet again strengthens the argument that only a
subset of Indian AA groups has acquired one sublineage of
R7a1 in situ after their arrival to Indian subcontinent from
local non-AA groups through admixture. Thus, we fail to
find from the evidence of the extant maternal lineage pool
of the Austro Asiatic speakers of India any major lineages
that show signs of potential origin outside India. Overall,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/227

the enigma of the origins and demographic past of the AA
speakers in India remains, for while the East Asian contribution to their paternal gene pool seems evident, the
maternal side of their genetic heritage appears to be autochthonous to Indian subcontinent. This suggests that
introduction and spread of AA speakers into India
involved a complex and sex-differentiated demography,
involving both exogenous males and local females.
In brief, our high-resolution study of haplogroup R7 suggests that this haplogroup originated in India among nonAA population most probably Dravidian, and that the
Munda (mainly Kherwari group) speaking populations
have acquired a subset of it only relatively recently. The
highest frequency of haplogroup R7 among Austro-Asiatic
tribal groups can be explained, thus, by their regional
admixture with other local Indian subcontinental populations followed by random genetic drift, rather than being
a genetic marker of their own. The spread of R7 as well as
other ancient sub-clades of haplogroup R in India follows
predominantly the geographic rather than linguistic landscape of the subcontinent. The geographic correlations are
further manifested in the distribution patterns of the subclades: R7a being more common in northern India while
R7b is more frequent in the southern parts of the subcontinent. Because Dravidian speakers harbour all the twigs
of R7 identified so far, the haplogroup may have arisen
among the matrilineal ancestry of the present day Dravidian speakers. However, it is important to caution that
autochthonous basal mtDNA lineages in South as well as
Southeast and East Asia appear to be significantly more
ancient than any linguistic reconstruction offers to present
day language families. This would imply that linguistically significant relationships among Indian populations
may be superimposed on, and masking, demographic
events of much greater antiquity. Our results also remind
us, once again, that phylogenetically established withinhaplogroup diversity is more informative than mere frequency in establishing the direction of gene flow between
populations, language groups and geographically defined
regions.

Methods
To refine the phylogeny of superhaplogroup R we
sequenced complete mitochondrial genomes of 35 samples selected from different regions and language groups
of India (Table 1). The results were incorporated into a
phylogenetic tree [see Additional file 1]; for detailed tree
for hg R7 see Fig. 1) together with previously published
complete mtDNA sequence data from India [4]. For haplogroup R7 we performed a high-resolution survey of phylogenetically diagnostic markers, using information from
complete mtDNA sequences. We studied ~12,000 samples collected from all over Indian subcontinent [see
Additional file 6]. These samples cover all the language

groups and most of the Indian states and union territories.
The samples were screened for the presence of R7 mtDNAs
based on HVS-I information (motif: 16260-1626116319-16362). Previously this motif has, together with
the restriction enzyme AluI cutting site polymorphism at
np. 10143, been used to define haplogroup R20 [14].
However, with the support of new complete mtDNA
sequences information the lineage with this HVSI motif
was subsequently named R7 [4] and we follow this update
of the nomenclature. Further, the identified R7 samples
were analyzed for coding region markers by sequencing.
Sequencing was carried out in ABI 3730 and 3730XL DNA
Analyzers (Applied Biosystems, USA) and mutations were
scored against the rCRS [33]. To minimize errors, both
strands were double-sequenced. Principal component
analysis (PCA) of R subgroups was performed using POPSTR, kindly provided by H. Harpending. Median-joining
and reduced median networks were reconstructed with
NETWORK program (version 4.1) [34]http://www.fluxusengineering.com. Reduced median and median-joining
procedures were applied sequentially. Coalescence time
has been calculated between nucleotide positions 16090–
16365 (HVS-I) considering one transition equals to
20,180 years [31], while for the coding region estimates
we employed the rate calibrated by Kivisild et al. [32] con-

sidering substitution rate estimate for protein-coding synonymous changes of 3.5 × 10-8, which gives 6,764 years
per synonymous transition. Standard deviation of the rho
estimate (σ) was calculated as in Saillard et al. [35]. Haplogroup isofrequency maps were generated by using
Surfer 7 of Golden Software (Golden Software Inc.,
Golden, Colorado), following the Kriging procedure. To
determine whether language or geography has the strongest impact on genetic differentiation, spatial autocorrelation, SAAP [36] and Mantel [37] tests were performed
using ARLEQUIN version 2.0 [38]. For Mantel test genetic
distance matrixes were generated from ARLEQUIN, and
geographic distance calculated from latitude and longitude information. For language groups linguistic distances
(ranging from 10–100) assigned manually to each
branch, based on published linguistic information and
vocabulary match [26-28,39,40].
