Genome size evolution at the speciation level:
The cryptic species complex Brachionus plicatilis
(Rotifera)
Claus-Peter Stelzer*†, Simone Riss† and Peter Stadler

Abstract
Background: Studies on genome size variation in animals are rarely done at lower taxonomic levels, e.g., slightly
above/below the species level. Yet, such variation might provide important clues on the tempo and mode of
genome size evolution. In this study we used the flow-cytometry method to study the evolution of genome size in
the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis, a cryptic species complex consisting of at least 14 closely related species.
Results: We found an unexpectedly high variation in this species complex, with genome sizes ranging
approximately seven-fold (haploid ‘1C’ genome sizes: 0.056-0.416 pg). Most of this variation (67%) could be
ascribed to the major clades of the species complex, i.e. clades that are well separated according to most species
definitions. However, we also found substantial variation (32%) at lower taxonomic levels - within and among
genealogical species - and, interestingly, among species pairs that are not completely reproductively isolated. In
one genealogical species, called B. ‘Austria’, we found greatly enlarged genome sizes that could roughly be
approximated as multiples of the genomes of its closest relatives, which suggests that whole-genome duplications
have occurred early during separation of this lineage. Overall, genome size was significantly correlated to egg size
and body size, even though the latter became non-significant after controlling for phylogenetic nonindependence.
Conclusions: Our study suggests that substantial genome size variation can build up early during speciation,
potentially even among isolated populations. An alternative, but not mutually exclusive interpretation might be
that reproductive isolation tends to build up unusually slow in this species complex.

Background
Genome size, measured as the haploid nuclear DNA content (C-value), is extremely variable among eukaryotes.
This variation has long puzzled biologists, because it
could not be accounted by organismal complexity or the
total number of genes (C-value paradox). In the last decades it has become evident that the observed genome
size variation is largely caused by differences in the content of non-coding and/or repetitive DNA, such as
introns, pseudogenes, or transposable elements [1,2].
Nevertheless, there are still many unanswered questions
about genome size diversity, such as the actual causes
driving the differences in DNA content, speed and mode

of changes in genome size over population genetic and
longer evolutionary time scales, or the cellular and organismal consequences of large vs. small genome size [3].
So far, most genome size comparisons in animals have
been done at high taxonomic levels, e.g., between
classes, families, or genera (e.g.[4-7]). Studies on genome
size variation among strains or closely related species
are still very scarce (but see, [8,9]). Yet, variation at
these lower taxonomic levels might provide important
clues on the tempo and mode of genome size evolution.
Whenever two species have become separated in their
evolutionary trajectories, their genome sizes might
diverge neutrally, due to independently occurring processes of genome expansion and genomic deletion,
unless there are factors constraining the evolution of
genome size. In asexually reproducing organisms such
processes might even occur on the population level.

Such accumulated differences can become important,
because they may contribute to genomic incompatibility,
hybrid inviability, or reproductive isolation. For instance,
a causal role of genome changes in speciation has been
suspected for gen(om)e duplications [10,11] and transposable elements (see [12], and references therein). In
this study we focus on the evolution of genome size in
Brachionus plicatilis, a cryptic species complex consisting of at least 14 closely related species [13-15].
Cryptic species complexes have been described in
many animal groups (e.g., [16-18]). In particular, small
microscopic invertebrates seem to harbor large amounts
of hidden genetic diversity within morphotypes that had
been traditionally classified as a single species. The rotifer B. plicatilis is one of the most striking examples of
such hidden diversity: initially described as a single species, it has experienced an enormous taxonomic inflation to currently 14-22 postulated species, based on
molecular markers [14,15]. Morphological discrimination among some species of this complex is possible,
however difficult, as it involves tight experimental control over environmental and developmental variation
[19] or sophisticated analysis methods combined with
high sample sizes [20]. Despite the morphological similarity among members of the B. plicatilis complex,
recent studies have demonstrated extensive ecological
diversification in terms of temperature or salinity preferences [21] and prezygotic and postzygotic reproductive
isolation among members in this species complex
[14,22,23]. In addition there are large differences in
body size, with more or less continuous variation across
species [14,24]. In the last decade, B. plicatilis has
emerged as an important model organism for studies on
speciation, sexual signaling [25-27], mate choice [23,28],
biogeography [29,30], or selection in the wild [31,32]. B.
plicatilis is thus also a promising future candidate for
genome sequencing.
In this study we use the flow cytometry method to
estimate genome size variation in the B. plicatilis complex. We measured the genome sizes of 33 different
clones, representative of 12 cryptic species and analyze
these data in a phylogenetic context. In addition, we
examined body size and egg size variation in a subset of
our clones and tested whether genome size is significantly correlated with any of these variables. Finally we
discuss our results in the light of studies on reproductive isolation among members of the Brachionus plicatilis species complex.

genetic identity of our strains (Additional file 1,
Table S1). The three new African isolates (Bogoria1,
Nakuru1 and 2) shared 95% COI and 99% ITS1
sequence identity with isolates belonging to the B. ‘Austria’ lineage (Accession numbers: COI: AY785199, ITS1:
AF387210). Our new clone OHJ4 exhibited identical
sequences to previously published ones for a B. ‘Austria’
isolate (COI: AY785199, ITS1: AY772119), while those
from clone OHJ1 were identical to another B. ‘Austria’
isolate (COI: AY785201, ITS1: AY772121), except for
one nucleotide position in ITS1. For several clones only
one of the markers was available from existing databases
- either COI or ITS1 (see Additional File 1, Table S1).
In these cases, we provided the missing marker
sequences. Our new sequences, or sequences that were
substantially longer than database sequences, have been
submitted to the EMBL database with the accession
numbers FR729668-FR729726.
Phylogenetic analyses

Both weighting schemes utilized in the MP analyses of
the partial COI sequences (equal weighting; according to
codon position: 1st: 2, 2nd:10, 3rd:1) generated the same
consensus trees as the NJ analysis. Nodal support for
previously described species was generally high for both
phylogenetic methods (for subset 2: usually 100%, except
for B. ‘Cayman’: 78 to 95% and species “S. 12” including
Hawaii: 74 to 91%). In general, there were no strongly
supported discrepancies in topology of the ITS1 trees
resulting from the two different tree building methods.
However, while all the 3 branches leading to major clades
exhibited strong bootstrap support in the NJ consensus
tree, the branch leading to clade B suffered from weak
bootstrap support in the MP consensus trees. Employing
gaps as 5th base in MP improved bootstrap support
(from <50 to 68%). No disagreements among the groupings of isolates into certain clades/species between COI
and ITS1 trees were found. MP analysis of the combined
sequence data sets using two different weighting schemes
and gap handling and NJ analysis produced consensus
trees with similar topologies (Additional file 1,
Figure S1), which were in accordance with previously
published phylogenies [13,14]. The trees for the analysis
of phylogenetically independent contrasts were constructed from the combined data set by MP method with
equal weighting and treating gaps as 5 th base e.g. as
shown in Figure 1 for subset 1.

showed that the largest proportion of total variance in
genome size was observed among the three major clades
(67%; see Table 2; clades labeled A, B, and C in Figure 1),
followed by 25% of the variation that could be attributed
to the species level. Variation among clones (i.e., within
species) amounted only to 7%. Yet, it is evident that within
species-variation in the ‘Austria’ lineage was higher than in
other lineages with comparable phylogenetic structure (e.
g., B. plicatilis s.s., see Figure 1 and Table 1).
Our results indicate that whole-genome duplications
have occurred during the evolution of the B. ‘Austria’
lineage. Genome sizes within this lineage could be
approximated roughly as multiples of 0.12 pg (117 Mbp;
see Table 1 and Additional file 1, Figure S2). Interestingly, this is the average genome size of the three most
closely related species (B. plicatilis s.s., B. ‘Nevada’, B.
manjavacas). For instance, clones of two east African
lakes (Bogoria, Nakuru) and clones isolated from Obere
Halbjochlacke (OHJ1, OHJ4) had genome sizes of 0.221-

0.262 pg (216 - 256 Mbp), whereas one clone isolated in
Mongolia (MNCHU024) had a genome size of 0.348 pg
(340 Mbp). An exception from this pattern is the
MNCHU008 clone, also isolated from a Mongolian
inland lake, which had a haploid genome size of 0.416
pg (407 Mbp) - clearly less than the expected 0.48 pg
(467 Mbp).
Correlations between genome size and body/egg size

There was considerable variation in body size and egg size
among the clones in our study (Figure 2). This is consistent with earlier studies [14,24], in particular, the finding
that the three major phylogenetic clades showed morphological divergence into large morphotypes (clade A), medium (clade B), and small mophotypes (clade C).
Interestingly this is correlated with genome size (Figure 2).
Thus, we analyzed in more detail these correlations, in
order to test the hypothesis that genome size might influence body or egg size variation in these eutelic organisms.

To test for phylogenetic autocorrelation, we employed
the method suggested by Abouheif [33] involving ‘tests
for serial independence’ before and after calculating
PICs (phylogenetically independent contrasts) according
to Felsenstein [34]. We first applied this method to our
full data set of 26 clones, for which we had data on all
three variables (genome size, body size, and egg size). In
this full data set, phylogenetic autocorrelations could be
successfully removed in the PICs of body size and egg
size (Table 3). However, PICs of genome size remained
significantly autocorrelated (Table 3). We assume that
the reason for this were the strong genome size differences within the B. ‘Austria’ lineage, which probably

represent a strong deviation from the Brownian motion
model, which underlies the calculations of PICs [34].
Therefore we repeated these calculations with a dataset
that excluded the B. ‘Austria’ lineage and found that
phylogenetic autocorrelation could be successfully
removed (Table 3). Correlation analysis on PICs calculated from this reduced dataset showed that the correlation between genome size and egg size remained
significant after controlling for phylogenetic non-independence (Table 4). However the correlation between
genome size and body size became non-significant
(Table 4).

Discussion
The purpose of this study was to examine genome size
variation in the Brachionus plicatilis complex, with the
aim of quantifying the amounts of genome size diversification that might build up at the time scales of speciation. We found an unexpectedly high variation in this
species complex, with genome sizes ranging approximately seven-fold. This variation is even higher than
that observed, so far, among some rotifer species that
are more distantly related and belong to different genera
[35]. An analysis of the variance components showed
that the largest proportions of total variance in genome
size were observed at high taxonomic levels (i.e., above
the species level). However, it should be kept in mind
that this analysis refers the genealogical species concept.
If we would apply other species concepts, some of the
genealogical species would merge, resulting in a higher
within-species variation (see below: Genome size variation and speciation)

Our results suggested that whole-genome duplications
have played a role in the evolution of the B. ‘Austria’
lineage. Such duplications might have been followed by
gradual reductions in genome size, which could explain
the lower-than-expected genome size of the Mongolian
MNCHU008 clone. Interestingly, such “genome downsizing” has been frequently observed in polyploid plants,
where C-values have been found to be less than
expected based on the degree of ploidy [36,37]. Genome
downsizing is believed to aid in the elimination of
dosage effects, caused by extra DNA sequences, and to
restore normal cytological and genetic behavior [37].
Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that our conclusions about whole-genome duplications in B. ‘Austria’
are based solely on observations of genome size variation. Thus we cannot rule out alternative mechanistic
explanations, such as a massive accumulation of retrotransposons, which might incidentally lead to similar
patterns of genome size variation (e.g., [38]). Future studies are therefore needed to elucidate the exact mechanism of genome expansion in the B. ‘Austria’ group.
We assume that the genome size differences among
clones within B. ‘Austria’ are fixed for each population
and reflect divergence among populations (or, incipient
species). This would be in line with other studies showing “quantum variation” of genome size among members of a taxonomic group (see [6], and references
therein), even though most of these studies addressed
genome size variation at higher taxonomic levels
(between classes, families, or genera). An alternative
explanation might be that the genome size variation
observed among our ‘Austria’ clones is incidental, in
that we might have sampled polymorphic populations
consisting of clones of different ploidy and happened to
sample two clones with higher ploidy in the Mongolian
populations. We consider this unlikely for several reasons. First, we never found clones with genome sizes of
~0.12 pg in the B. ‘Austria’ lineage. This supports the
hypothesis that at least one whole-genome duplication
happened very early when B.’Austria’ separated from the
other lineages. Second, in populations from which we
sampled several conspecific individuals (such as for
populations of lake Bogoria and lake Nakuru) we did
not find any evidence for multiple ploidy states. For the
Bogoria population, we actually measured the genome
sizes of several additional clones, and all these clones
had genome sizes of ~0.22 pg ([35], and unpublished
results). Third, substantial differences in genome size
were always observed among clones that also differed in
both their ITS1 and COI sequences (e.g. the two
MNCHU clones), suggesting that they belong to reproductively isolated populations, rather than the same
population.

Correlates of genome size

Genome size was significantly correlated to egg size.
This result is consistent with other studies showing correlations between genome size and cell size (e.g., [6]).
The correlation between genome size and egg size
might be expected, since rotifer egg size is determined
before the first cell division. For the same reasons, it
might be expected that body size is correlated to genome size, since rotifers are eutelic. However, this correlation became non-significant after we controlled for
phylogenetic non-independence (Table 4). A possible
explanation for the lack of significance could be developmental variance: Our Brachionus clones originated
from a variety of habitats, from different latitudes, salinities, or water chemistry (e.g., alkaline lakes vs. brackish
water). If they were locally adapted to these conditions,
our experimental conditions (12 ppt artificial seawater,
23-24°C) might have favored somatic growth
differentially.
Genome size variation and speciation

The Brachionus plicatilis species complex is a good
example for the difficulties in reconciling different species concepts (SC), such as the morphological SC, the
biological SC, or the genealogical SC. Species boundaries
in Brachionus plicatilis can vary considerably depending
on which concept is applied [14]. For instance, while the
genealogical SC suggests a clear separation of B. manjavacas from the other species of the clade A (see Figure
1), crossing experiments among these species often
result in mating behavior [23], zygote formation, or even
viable F1-offspring [14]. By contrast, the deeply diverged
clades A, B, and C are well separated in terms of all species concepts, indicating that they are old [14].
The latter is consistent with our result that most of
the variation in genome size (67%; see Table 2) can be
ascribed to these major clades. However, we also found
substantial variation at lower taxonomic levels, within
and among genealogical species in each clade (32% =
25% + 7%; see Table 2). This suggests that substantial
genome size variation can build up early during speciation, since many of the genealogical species identified by
Suatoni et al. [14] have not yet become fully reproductively isolated. For instance, our clones “Lostlake1” and
“SM5” differed 1.3-fold in genome size, yet Suatoni et al.
[14] observed successful F1-offspring production in
crosses between these two clones (note that “SM5” is
called “Poza Sur SM” in that study). Likewise, males of
the “Russian” strain (B. manjavacas) exhibited mating
behavior towards females of the B. ‘Austria’ lineage [23],
despite the fact that the genome sizes of the latter are at
least 2-fold larger.
The existence of intraspecific genome size variation
has been debated extensively in the past, especially

Page 6 of 10

among botanists [39-41]. To date, there are several case
studies which unambiguously documented such intraspecific variation in plants, even though the magnitude of
intraspecific variation is usually low compared to the
variation observed among species (e.g., [42]). In comparison to such estimates, intraspecific variation in the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis seems extraordinarily high,
especially if we apply the biological species concept.
There are several interpretations to this pattern. First,
new genome size variation might indeed be generated at
very high rates in this species complex (or removed at
very low rates). If this were the case, we should expect
significant variability in genome size even among individuals of the same population. Unfortunately our data do
not allow conclusions in this respect, since most clones
derived from different populations. However future studies could address this question by examining a larger
number of individuals deriving from the same population, and perhaps by examining their sexually produced
offspring. This would be particularly interesting in case
of the B. ‘Austria’ lineage. Recent studies in plants indicate that such genome size variation within populations
can reach levels that are high enough to be detected by
flow cytometry (reviewed by [43]). A second explanation
for the high intraspecific variation in B. plicatilis might
be that the formation of reproductive barriers in this
species complex proceeds unusually slow. This is actually indicated by a general observation in the B. plicatilis
complex: genealogical species tend to merge if the biological species concept is applied [14]. Nevertheless, it
should also be kept in mind that successful experimental
crosses between lineages (such as the “Lostlake1” and
“SM5” clones, see above) do not necessarily mean that
the resulting offspring would have high fitness under
natural conditions, hence, the term ‘reproductive barrier’ itself is difficult to define. Future studies are therefore needed to estimate the fitness consequences of
hybridization between lineages with very distinct genome sizes. Such experiments would ideally include backcrosses and fitness assays under natural conditions.

Conclusion
In this study we observed substantial amounts of genome size variation at or slightly above the species level.
This suggests that genome size variation can build up
early during speciation, and that some of this variation
may even accumulate among subdivided populations. It
remains to be investigated to which extend such genome
size variation might directly contribute to speciation.
Methods
Sources of strains and cultivation methods

In total, we analyzed 33 rotifer clones representing various strains of the B. plicatilis complex (see Additional

Stelzer et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:90
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/90

file 1, Table S1). The majority of these clones were provided as resting eggs by several colleagues worldwide
(see acknowledgments) and had been used in previous
studies [13,14,23] providing information on potential
species, phylogenetic relationships and cross-mating success. Further, we isolated five new rotifer clones from
water samples of a small lake called Obere Halbjochlacke (Austria), and from sediment samples of two
East African lakes, Lake Bogoria and Lake Nakuru. The
two Mongolian clones (MNCHU008, MNCHU024) were
originally collected by Christian Jersabek [44]. Clonal
cultures were established from single asexual females.
All culture work and experiments were done at a temperature of 23-24°C. Rotifers were grown in a modified
F/2 medium at 12 ppt salinity and fed with the algae
Tetraselmis suecica at ad libitum concentrations (5001000 cells μl-1).
Flow cytometry

To obtain large amounts of biomass, rotifers were cultured in 1L glass bottles, aerated with sterile air through
a glass tube. The cultures were initiated with 50-100
females and were grown for 7-10 days until they reached
population densities of 10-100 individuals per mL. Rotifer biomass was harvested with 30 μm sieves, resuspended in sterile culture medium and starved for 16 h.
After two additional washes with sterile culture medium,
cleaned rotifer biomass was resuspended in 10 mL Stock
solution (3.4 mM Trisodium citrate dihydrate, Nonidet
P40 at 0.1% v/v, 1.5 mM Sperminetetrahydrochloride,
0.5 mM Trishydroxymethyl-aminomethane, pH 7.6),
concentrated by centrifugation (1 min at 1000 g) and
buffer was removed to 0.3-1 mL (depending on the
amount of initial biomass). This procedure typically
resulted in harvests of 5-20 μl concentrated biomass.
Rotifer biomass was ground on ice with 50 strokes in a
1 mL Dounce tissue homogenizer, to free individual
nuclei. Large debris was removed by filtration through a
35 μm mesh nylon sieve. For staining of nuclei and
flow-cytometric analysis we applied the method
described in Stelzer et al. [45]. Briefly, 100 μl of the
homogenized cell suspension was digested by addition
of 450 μl of 0.003% Trypsin (dissolved in stock solution)
for 10 min at room temperature. To prevent further
degradation, 0.05% trypsin inhibitor was added (this
solution also included 0.01% RNAse A) and the samples
were incubated for another 10 min. Finally, samples
were stained with propidium iodide at a concentration
of 50 μg/mL. Stained samples were kept for 2-3 h on ice
in the dark. Flow cytometric analysis was performed in a
FacsCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with an
excitation wavelength of 488 nm and propidium iodide
emission was measured in the FL2-A channels according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. As internal standard

Page 7 of 10

of known genome size we used the fruit fly, Drosophila
melanogaster (strain ISO-1, nuclear DNA content: 0.35
pg [46]). Ten female Drosophila heads were homogenized in 0.5 ml Stock solution with 15 strokes in the
Dounce tissue homogenizer, and 100 μl of this homogenate was co-prepared with the rotifer samples and
stained in exactly the same way. Rotifer samples and
Drosophila standard were first run separately on the cytometer, to identify the position of the peaks and to
determine the approximate concentration of nuclei, and
then combined into the same sample and measured
again. Coefficients of variance of individual peaks were
5.5%, on average, for rotifers (down to 2.62%), and 3.9%
for Drosophila, (down to 2.36%). Each sample was analyzed until a pre-specified number of 7,000 events (i.e.,
particles registered by the fluorescence detectors) were
reached, typically at a rate ~30 events per second. When
rotifer samples were measured in combination with the
internal Drosophila standard, the number of counted
events was increased to 15,000. In total, we analyzed
140 biomass preparations (= biological replicates) of 33
different clones. At least four replicates were prepared
from each rotifer clone. To avoid bias due to temporal
fluctuations in flow cytometer performance, each replicate was measured on a different day (sometimes with
several weeks between two measurements). Conversion
from pictograms DNA to base pairs were made with the
factor: 1 pg = 978 Mbp [47].
DNA sequencing and phylogeny

DNA was extracted from 50 to 300 μl of frozen rotifer
biomass using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen).
Biomass was prepared in the same way as described
above for flow cytometry, except that the starved and
cleaned rotifers were fixed in 70% ethanol, instead of
the stock solution, and stored at -20°C. A 712-bp region
of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I
(COI) was amplified and sequenced using the primers
LCO1490 and HCO2198 [48]. Further, a ca. 592 to 611bp segment containing the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) was amplified using the primers
III and VIII [49]. PCR reactions were carried out in 20
μl volumes using HotStarTaq Plus DNA Polymerase
(Qiagen). Cycling parameters were: one cycle: 95°C for
5 min; 5 cycles: 94°C for 40 sec, 50°C for 40 sec, 72°c
for 1 min; 35 cycles: 94°C for 40 sec, 51°C for 40 sec,
72°C for 1 min; 72°C for 10 min. Purified PCR products
were sequenced by Macrogen Co. Ltd. (Seoul, South
Korea). We obtained sequences for all clones of our
study, even for those clones for which we already had
prior sequence information, to provide an independent
confirmation of their clonal identity.
A 603-bp region of COI was aligned manually. After
testing a variety of different weighting levels and gap

Stelzer et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:90
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/90

extension penalties in ClustalX, the non-coding ITS1
sequences (size range: 314 to 331 bp) were first aligned
using the default options and then polymorphic sites
were further manually adjusted in Bioedit. Sequences
from the freshwater rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus were
used as outgroup (COI: AF387296, ITS1: AF387243).
The dataset was divided into 4 subsets containing: (1)
all 33 clones used in this study (2) set 1 with additional
sequences, downloaded from public databases, representing B. plicatilis strains not covered in this study (3)
only those 26 clones of our study for which genome,
egg and body size were available and (4) set 3 without
the B. ‘Austria’ lineage. The main purpose for these different subsets was to ensure that confinement on a certain set of clones would not fundamentally alter their
inferred phylogenetic relationship.
Phylogenetic analyses were implemented in PAUP version 4.0 b10 [50] using neighbor-joining (NJ) and maximum-parsimony (MP) methods. In general, we applied
similar procedures as described in precious phylogenetic
studies on the B. plicatilis complex [13,14]. Both markers were analyzed separately and also as a combined
dataset, after testing for heterogeneity between data partitions using a partition-homogeneity test with 1000
replicates in PAUP*. MP heuristic searches (100 random
taxon addition replicates) were conducted with tree
bisection reconnection (TBR) branch-swapping. Searches
were employed both treating gaps as a fifth state and as
missing data, since gaps can hold important phylogenetic information. In the separate as well as in the combined analyses, we tried equal weighting and a weighting
scheme according to the different codon positions (1st:
2, 2nd:10, 3rd:1) for the COI region only. Nodal support
was calculated using 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates
with the same optimality criterion utilized to construct
the tree. Polytomies were forced in the tree in cases
were bootstrap support was below 50%.
NJ analyses included the best fitting model of nucleotide substitution found by Modeltest 3.7 employing a
hierarchical likelihood ratio test [51] for each gene and
the combined data set (COI: GTR+G+I; ITS1: variable e.
g. TVM+G for subset2; combined data set: GTR+G+I).
Body and egg size measurements

Body size and egg size was measured in 26 of our
experimental clones. To minimize developmental and
environmental variation, we established cohorts of
equally aged females, which were all processed within a
single experiment using the same batches of food algae
and media. Experimental females were collected as
young hatchlings (age <4 h) from individually cultured
parental females. Experimental females were then cultured until the age of 72 h, with daily transfers to fresh
medium. At this age, they were young adults and usually

Page 8 of 10

carried 2-3 eggs. Females and eggs were fixed in Lugol’s
solution and measured using inverted microscopy at
100, 200 and 400-fold magnification and computeraided image analysis (NIS elements, Nikon). Body size
measurements included three distance measurements:
total length, maximum breadth, and the breadth at the
anterior end (at the base of the anterior spines). Body
volume was calculated from these three distance measurements, assuming that the body shape can be
approximated to a general ellipsoid with total length as
the polar radius and the two breath measurements as
the equatorial radii. Egg volumes were calculated from
length and breath measurements, assuming that egg
shape can be approximated by an ellipsoid of revolution.
Statistics

We estimated variance components of different taxonomic levels using SPSS (version 18.0) with the REML
(= restricted maximum likelihood) option selected, due
to the unequal sample sizes in our data set. Correlations
between genome size and egg size or body size were
analyzed using Pearson correlations on log-transformed
data. To test for phylogenetic non-independence in
these data, we applied the algorithm described by Abouheif [33], which involves ‘tests for serial independence’(TFSI). First, a TFSI was conducted on the logtransformed data, to determine whether it was at all
necessary to correct for phylogenetic non-independence
in our data set. Second, we calculated Felsenstein’s PICs
(phylogenetically independent contrasts) [34] using the
PDAP module of Mesquite version 2.73 [52,53]. Third,
we conducted a second TFSI, to verify that phylogenetic
non-independence had been successfully removed in the
PICs [33].
