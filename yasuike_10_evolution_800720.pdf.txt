Abstract
Background: The Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus possesses two parallel IgH
isoloci (IGH-A and IGH-B), that are related to the genomic duplication event in the family Salmonidae. These
duplicated IgH loci in Atlantic salmon provide a unique opportunity to examine the mechanisms of genome
diversity and genome evolution of the IgH loci in vertebrates. In this study, we defined the structure of these loci
in Atlantic salmon, and sequenced 24 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones that were assembled into the
IGH-A (1.1 Mb) and IGH-B (0.9 Mb) loci. In addition, over 7,000 cDNA clones from the IgH variable (VH) region have
been sequenced and analyzed.
Results: The present study shows that the genomic organization of the duplicated IgH loci in Atlantic salmon
differs from that in other teleosts and other vertebrates. The loci possess multiple Cτ genes upstream of the Cμ
region, with three of the Cτ genes being functional. Moreover, the duplicated loci possess over 300 VH segments
which could be classified into 18 families. This is the largest number of VH families currently defined in any
vertebrate. There were significant structural differences between the two loci, indicating that both IGH-A and -B loci
have evolved independently in the short time after the recent genome duplication approximately 60 mya.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that the duplication of the IgH loci in Atlantic salmon significantly contributes to
the increased diversity of the antibody repertoire, as compared with the single IgH locus in other vertebrates.

Background
The adaptive immune system based on somatic recombination of immune receptor genes appeared in vertebrates some 500 million years ago (mya) [1,2]. While
jawless vertebrates, such as lamprey and hagfish, assemble their variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) through
recombination of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) modular
units [3-5], jawed vertebrates generate their diverse
repertoire of B and T cell antigen receptors through
rearrangement of variable-(diversity)-joining (V-(D)-J)
gene segments [6,7].
Immunoglobulins (Igs) are key molecules within the
jawed vertebrate humoral immune system that are generated by the B cells for defence against a wide variety
of pathogens. Igs are composed of two heavy (H) chains

and two light (L) chains that are encoded by the IgH
locus and IgL locus, respectively. Two different types of
genomic rearrangement of the IgH locus have evolved.
In cartilaginous fishes, such as sharks and skates, closely
linked individual clusters of VH-D-D-J-Constant (CH)
gene segments are repeated 100 - 200 times [8,9]. In
contrast, in most bony vertebrates (from teleost fishes to
mammals), the VH, D, JH, and CH gene segments are in
tandem arrays, also known as translocon organisation
(VH) n -(D) m -(JH) x -(CH) y [10-13]. The contribution of
multiple germ line VH, D and JH gene segments to antibody diversity is magnified by the random rearrangement of these segments in somatic cells [14]. In
response to an antigen, mature B cells can change their
expressed CH region genes, and the different CH region
genes that possess different effector functions. In mammals, there are five Ig classes, named for their CH
region component as IgM (μ chain), IgD (δ chain), IgG
(g chain), IgA (a chain) and IgE (ε chain) [9,15]. In teleosts, the predominant serum antibody is IgM, which

was the first Ig class identified [13]. Subsequently, IgD
was also found, but the teleost IgD gene is expressed as
a chimeric transcript that includes the first exon of the
IgM gene (Cμ1) [16-20]. It has long been believed that
teleost fish possess only IgM and IgD. However, novel
Ig classes (IgTs) have recently been found in zebrafish
(Danio rerio) (IgZ) [21], rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus
mykiss) [22], fugu (Fugu rubripes) (novel IgH) [23] and
carp (Cyprinus carpio) (IgM-IgZ chimera) [24] as more
sequences have become available.
In the zebrafish and rainbow trout IgH locus, a CH
gene (Cτ) of the novel Ig class (IgT) exists upstream of
Cμ and Cδ genes, possessing its own D and JH segments
[21,22]. This organization of genes in the zebrafish and
rainbow trout IgH loci resembles the mouse T cell
receptor (TCR) a/δ locus (TRA/TRD) [21]. Similarly, the
fugu ortholog of IgT (novel IgH) is also found upstream
of Cμ and Cδ genes and this Ig has its own D and JH
segments, but the gene organization of the fugu IgT differs significantly from zebrafish and rainbow trout IgTs
[23]. However, in catfish, a CH region upstream of Cμ
and Cδ genes similar to IgT has not been found [25]. In
addition, the catfish IgH locus contains three linked
pairs of Cμ and Cδ genes, but only one Cμ and possibly
three Cδ genes are functional [25-27]. The three different Cδ gene regions encode heavy chains of membrane
and secreted IgD, and although secreted IgD has so far
been found only in catfish, it may not contain a functional V-region [26]. Recently, it has been reported that
the stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) IgH locus contains three tandem duplicated Cτ, Cμ and Cδ genes
separated by VH, D, and JH segments, as well as a
fourth Cτ gene in the 3` end of the locus [28,29]. These
findings indicate that there is a large amount of variability within the IgH loci among teleosts.
One interesting feature of the Atlantic salmon (Salmo
salar) IgH locus is that it possesses two parallel IgH isoloci (IGH-A and IGH-B) [12,30-32], that are related to
the tetraploid ancestry of the family Salmonidae [30,33].
A recent study by Shiina et al. (2005) estimated the
duplication event to have taken place approx. 60 mya
based on sequence divergence of duplicated MHC class
I regions of rainbow trout [34] Recently, the presence of
two IgH loci have also been demonstrated in rainbow
trout by in situ hybridization to rainbow trout chromosomal spreads with IgH-positive BAC clones [22]. However, only approximately 100 kb of the 3’ end of one
rainbow trout IgH locus has been sequenced to date.
Two IgM isotypes were found in Atlantic salmon and
brown trout (Salmo trutta), while it has been suggested
through gel filtration analysis that rainbow trout and
Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) possess a single IgM
[35]. Moreover, only one Cμ cDNA has been found
from a single homozygous rainbow trout, whereas

duplicated versions of the rainbow trout Cτ and Cδ
genes have been suggested from cDNA variants [22].
These findings suggest that rainbow trout and Arctic
char lost an intact IgM in evolution after the genera
Salmo, Oncorhynchus and Salvelinus radiated (10 - 18
mya) [35,36]. Thus, determination of the structure of
the loci in Atlantic salmon provides a unique opportunity for understanding the evolution of the IgH locus in
salmonids.
In this study, to define the structure of the loci in
Atlantic salmon, 24 bacterial artificial chromosome
(BAC) clones were sequenced and complete IGH-A (1.1
Mb) and IGH-B (0.9 Mb) loci were assembled. In addition, over 7,000 clones from the IgH variable (VH)
region cDNAs have been sequenced and analyzed. The
present study shows that the Atlantic salmon IgH locus
represents the most complex and diverse vertebrate IgH
locus characterized to date.

Results
Overall organization of IGH-A and IGH-B

Two loci were assembled from overlapping BAC
sequences. IGH-A was assembled from 7 BACs, and
IGH-B was assembled using 8 BACs. A few contigs,
internal to BACs could not be joined, resulting in two
contigs for IGH-A and four contigs for IGH-B, that are
separated by small gaps of unknown length in regions of
repeated sequences. The sequences in the two IgH loci
containing VH and CH regions cover approximately 670
kb (IGH-A) and 710 kb (IGH-B), respectively. Part of a
second allele for IGH-A was identified in the assembly
of a number of BAC sequences. We noted a similarity
of 99.7% over contigs spanning 190 kb sequence (data
not shown).
In each of the two IgH loci we identified numerous
VH segments, many D and JH segments and several CH
gene segments (Table 1, Figure 1, Additional file 1 and
Additional file 2). The CH sequences are comprised of
three classes, one Cμ and one Cδ in each locus and 3
and 5 complete or partial Cτ sequences, respectively.
The Cμ and Cδ sequences are the most 3’ elements in
both loci while the constant Cτ sequences are distributed throughout the loci. D and JH sequences are generally 5’ of the Cμ and Cτ sequences. Most interestingly,
the region that contains the VH sequences coincides
with the region that contains a large number of “Nhe I”
elements, piggyBAC-like sequences that have also been
recovered numerous times in the V region of the Atlantic salmon TRA/TRD locus [37].
The IGH-A and -B loci show 81-85% sequence identity surrounding the VH sequence region, but internally
less identity than 81-85%, indicating significant reorganization involving the VH gene and NheI-elements. Additional file 3 lists identified genes flanking the loci. A

dotter plot of IGH-A versus IGH-B is shown in Additional file 4. It is worth noting the similarity between
the sequences flanking the two loci as this is in stark
contrast to the lack of similarity between the loci
themselves.

Constant (CH) regions

Each locus contains several CH gene sequences, Cμ, Cδ,
and Cτ. At the 3’ end of each locus is one Cμ sequence
followed by one Cδ sequence as previously reported
[17,38]. The Cμ and Cδ sequences are approximately
98% similar between loci. Surprisingly, there are several
Cτ sequences, 5 in IGH-A and 3 in IGH-B, spread out
over each locus (Figure 1). The Cτ sequences in the
IGH-A are as follows: starting from the 5’ end; 1) CτA-1,
partial (most of exon 4 only), 2) CτA-2, partial (5’ start
to approximately 40 base pairs into exon 3), 3) CτA-3,
complete but has a frameshift, 4) CτA-4, complete but
in reverse orientation, and 5) CτA-5, complete (Figure
2). In IGH-B there is 1) CτB-1, a complete sequence but
with a frameshift, 2) CτB-2, complete, and 3) CτB-3, a
partial (missing exon 1) (Figure 2). CτB-1 and CτB-2 are
>99% identical. There are a total of two intact Cτ genes
in IGH-A and one intact Cτ gene in IGH-B (Table 1 and
Figure 2). The alignments of the intact CH gene amino
acid sequences are available in Additional file 5. We
constructed a phylogenetic tree from the translated
sequences of the three intact Cτ genes and other CH
genes (see Additional file 6). The three intact Cτ genes
clustered within a branch containing teleost Cζ/τ
sequences. Interestingly, CτA (CτA-4 and CτA-5) shared
a branch with the rainbow trout Cτ, and CτB-2 branched
basal to the CτAs/rainbow trout Cτ clade. It has been
reported that both duplicated IgD genes in Atlantic

salmon have a tandem duplication of Cδ 2 -Cδ 3 -Cδ 4
[17,38]. However, our present study shows that the
number of times exons (Cδ2 -Cδ3 -Cδ4 ) are repeated is
different between loci, three times in IGH-A and four
times in IGH-B (Figure 2). The sequence identity
between these repeats of the two loci is very high
(>98%), suggesting gene conversion events. The three
functional Cτ genes (CτB-2, CτA-4 and CτA-5), the two
Cμ genes (CμA and CμB) and Cδ genes (CδA and CδB)
have been submitted to Genbank and the accession
numbers are listed in Additional file 7.
Diversity (D) segments

D gene sequences were identified through the conserved
pattern of their recombination signal sequences (RSS). A
total of 25 D sequence genes were identified in the two
IgH loci (Figure 1). All segments are flanked on each
end by a consensus nonamer-heptamer combination
that is separated by 12 base pairs (see Additional file 8).
Nine are located in the IGH-A 5’ of the Cμ gene, in a

group of 6 and a group of 3. There are eight D segments associated with the three Cτ genes (0 for CτA-1
which has no 5’ part; 2 for CτA-2 which has exon 1 and
2 only; 0 for CτA -3; 2 for CτA-4 with also 3 on the 3’
side of the inverted CτA-4 (which is 5’ in the assembly)
and 1 for Cτ A -5) (Table 1). In IGH-B there are six D
segments associated with the Cμ gene and two with one
of the Cτ genes (CτB -2) (Table 1). Comparison of the
sequences of the six D elements in each of the two
groups associated with the Cμ genes in IGH-A and
IGH-B indicates that the D elements occur in the same
order in both loci. The additional group of three in
IGH-A is similar to the last three of the groups of six,
indicating a duplication event (see Additional file 9).
Joining (JH) segments

Each of the two Cμ genes is preceded by five JH
sequences as previously reported [12]. In addition, two
JH segments are associated with each Cτ gene, except
CτA-1 which has no 5’ region and CτB-1 which has only

a single JH segment, for a total of seven JH segments for
the Cτ genes in IGH-A and three JH segments for the
Cτ genes in IGH-B, located just 5’ upstream of their
respective Cτ gene (Table 1). All segments have a fairly
conserved 5’ RSS, a nonamer-heptamer combination
separated by 24 base pairs (see Additional file 10). A 3’
AGGT splice site is found in 18 sequences and a TGGT
site in 2 sequences. A translation of the coding sequence
reveals a highly conserved FDYWGKGTXVTVS amino
acid sequence. One of the JH sequences (JH-τB1-1) is a
pseudogene as it is interrupted by a TAG stop codon.
The corresponding JH sequences in IGH-A and IGH-B
are identical in coding sequence, except for JH-μA-3 and
JH-μB-3 [12], and therefore cannot be distinguished in
rearranged products.
Variable (VH) segments

Each locus contains a large number of VH genes and
pseudogenes (Figure 1). A total of 153 sequences in
IGH-A and 161 sequences in IGH-B were identified as
matching VH gene sequences. 99 sequences in IGH-A
and 103 sequences in IGH-B were characterized and
named. Of these, 23 in IGH-A and 32 in IGH-B have a
putative open reading frame (ORF). The deduced amino
acid sequences of these VH genes have been submitted
to Genbank and the accession numbers are listed in
Additional file 7. The alignments of VH genes amino
acid sequences are available in Additional file 11. Many
other sequences are found only as fragments. VH genes
start with a more or less consensus 5’-ATG(C/T)AAA
(G/T)-3’ octamer sequence [39] located 5’ to the site of
transcription initiation, and terminate at a nonamerheptamer RSS. VH genes have a short exon 1 and a
long exon 2 sequence. When complete exon 2
sequences (without the RSS) are aligned and 75% identity is applied, 18 families can be distinguished. Representative sequences from the 13 families that were
identified in Oncorhynchus mykiss [40,41] align within
13 of these 18 families (Figure 3). The distribution of
the VH families between IGH-A and -B is listed in
Additional file 12. The number of sequences identified
per family varies widely, from a single copy (in family
18) to 18 members (see Additional file 12). The orientation of the VH sequences indicates some rearrangement
within the loci and an inversion event is evident when
comparing IGH-A and IGH-B sequence (data not
shown). This inversion event explains the inverse orientation of the CτA-4 sequence in IGH-A.
The use of VH sequences was grouped by family for
analysis. VH families are used to a different extent by
different constant genes. For example, family 8 is used
by CμA much more frequently than by CμB , while the
opposite is true for family 6 VH genes (Figure 4). The
most commonly used gene families include families 1, 6,

Figure 3 Phylogenetic tree based on nucleotide sequences of
Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout VH genes. The tree was
constructed from complete exon 2 sequences (without the RSS).
These Atlantic salmon VH genes could be grouped into 18 families
(Fam 01 - 18), based on >75% nucleotide similarity. Examples from
thirteen VH families of rainbow trout [40,41] are shown in red
letters.

and 8, members of which comprise 60% of the putative
VH ORFs. Families that contain few members with
putative ORFs are also rarely recovered in ESTs.
Rearrangements

A comprehensive set of VH specific primers (178 VH
specific primers) were constructed to compliment CH
specific primers and ~12 clones from all positive products sequenced to identify expression and rearrangement patterns. More than 7,000 VH-D-JH-CH cloned
PCR products amplified from the kidney and spleen of
two healthy individuals. We found three main types of
rearrangements with VH sequences; those with a Cμ
gene, those with a Cτ gene, and those with both Cμ and
Cδ exons. However, not all rearrangements involving Cδ
include Cμ sequence.
Of 1,872 sequences generated from Cμ-specific primers, located in exon 2, 1,794 contained a conserved
sequence in exon 1 of the Cμ sequence and were further
analyzed. After removal of identical sequences, confirmation of an ORF in the amplified fragment, and a minimum of 98% match (BLAST) over 30 base pairs in the
variable sequence, a total of 225 unique sequences were
obtained containing the Cμ A gene and 358 sequences
with the CμB gene. The JH sequences associated with the
Cμ genes are not equally used; the middle JH (Cμ - JH-3)
occurs most frequently in rearrangements. In fact, the
use distribution for the Cμ- JH sequences by CμA and
CμB is quite similar (Figure 5).
Of 1,852 sequences generated from Cτ-specific primers, 1,555 contained a conserved sequence in exon 1

of the Cτ sequence and were further analyzed. After
removal of identical sequences, confirmation of an ORF
in the amplified fragment, and a minimum of 98%
match (BLAST) over 30 base pairs of variable sequences,
a total of 140 unique sequences were obtained containing the CτB-2 gene, 284 sequences with the CτA-4 gene,
and 39 sequences with the Cτ A -5 gene. Interestingly,
these three genes are the putatively functional Cτ
sequences, with the most frequently used CτA -4 gene
which is in an inverted orientation. Two instances were
observed where rearrangement took place with CτA-1,
which has only the first 2 exons. Both occurred with

Figure 5 Use of JH sequences in rearrangements. Because many
of the Cδ sequences are too similar in sequence to distinguish
them unequivocally, the CδA and CδB were put into single columns.

VH sequences that are 5’ of CτA-1. The inverted CτA-4
gene is found associated with VH sequences from both
5’ and 3’ of the constant sequence. In those instances
where the joining sequence can be uniquely identified,
we note that the CτB-2 gene is associated with JH-τB1-1,
rather than JH-τB2-2, 95% of the time.
cDNA sequences containing Cδ were obtained with
primers located in exon 3 of the Cδ sequence. There
were 832 sequences of those amplified with the Cδ specific primers that contained Cδ sequences. Approximately 90% of the sequences are chimeric transcripts
that contain the first exon of Cμ (Cμ 1 ). However, in
approximately 10% of the rearrangements involving Cδ,
no Cμ 1 sequence and generally no use of the normal
splice and recombination signals is evident. A JH and
VH sequence is not obvious in all of these cases in the
readable sequence and in many of these rearrangements
joining takes place from somewhere inside or just after
the VH sequence to various distributed sites inside exon
1, 2, and 3 of the Cδ sequence (Table 2). In one recovered rearrangement, the first RSS of the Cμ-D4
sequence and the second RSS of the next Cμ-D5
sequence is used, resulting in the use of two D
sequences including a 335 bp intervening genomic
sequence (est 007-171). Interestingly, in many of these
atypical rearrangements, joining occurs at a short repeat
sequence present at both joining ends (see Table 2 for
examples), indicative of a homology-directed

recombination event. Because many of the Cδ sequences
are too similar in sequence to distinguish them unequivocally, we were unable to distinguish the distribution
of JH sequences between the Cδ A and Cδ B . However,
the data still shows a preference for the middle JH by
Cδ as seen in CμA and CμB sequences (Figure 5).
In up to 20% of the rearrangements the variable
sequence was identified as from one locus and the constant sequence from the other locus. For example, Cμa
was found rearranged with members of family 1 and 8
from the IGH-B, and Cμb was found rearranged with
members of family 1 and 6 from the IGH-A. However,
twenty analyzed EST sequences in our EST database
[42] that contained a Cμ sequence, contained a VH
sequence from the same locus (data not shown). The
locus origin of the JH sequences in the rearrangements
could not be unambiguously established. Nevertheless,
in a number of these rearrangements, the point of crossover appears to be located in the amplified part of the
Cμ sequence based on the five single nucleotide differences between the two loci.
Expression of the Atlantic salmon Ig genes

The tissue distribution for four different forms of IgTs,
IgT-B2, IgT-A3, IgT-A4 and IgT-A5, was examined by
RT-PCR (Figure 6). Figure 6 represents the results from
analysis of 12 tissues from 3 different adult individuals.
The IgT genes were expressed at high levels in the kidney and spleen. It has been reported that other teleost
IgM and IgD genes were also primarily expressed in kidney and spleen [16,18,22]. The kidney and spleen are
the major lymphoid organs of teleosts [43,44]. The teleost anterior kidney is a main site for B lymphogenesis,
while the teleost posterior kidney provides an environment capable of inducing B cell activation and differentiation into plasma cells [45]. The teleost spleen
functions as a major secondary immune organ, as in
mammalian species. Mature B cells are abundant at this
site, and Ig-secreting cells have been detected from splenic B cells [46]. Interestingly, the IgT genes were also
highly expressed in the mucosal tissues, such as the gut
or gills (Figure 6). In other tissues, different expression
patterns were observed among the different Cτ genes
(Figure 6). In particular, the expression pattern of IgTA3 was quite different from the other three IgTs (Figure
6). Interestingly, the constant region of the IgT-A3
(CτA-3) has a frameshift, and does not have any D segments. In addition, we could not find the IgT-A3 in VH
cDNA clones. Therefore, the functionality of IgT-A3
must be questioned. It should also be noted that the
expression of IgT-A4 was not detected in one fish. The
expression of IgT-B2, IgT-A4 and IgT-A5 was highly
expressed in the heart. Hansen et al. (2005) have suggested that the expression of Ig genes in the heart is

most likely due to circulating B cells, because salmonid
blood is a rich source of leukocytes [22]. In the present
study, fish were bled before isolation of tissues but were
not exsanguinated. It is therefore assumed that blood
remained in the heart.
We also examined the expression of Ig genes during
three early developmental stages of Atlantic salmon by
RT-PCR (Figure 7). IgM and IgD were weakly detected
in the earliest stage (0.2 g/2.05 cm), and the expression
of both genes increased at later stages of development.
Similarly, the expression of both IgT-B2 and IgT-A5
was increased in these stages; however, the expression
of these genes was negative or very weak in the earliest
stage. Interestingly, the expression of IgT-A4 was not
detected in the 16.2 g/11.5 cm fish, and at especially
high levels in the 4.2 g/7.15 cm fish. Similarly, IgT-A3
was highly expressed in the 4.2 g/7.15 cm fish, and very
weak expression of the gene was observed in only one
individual of the 16.2 g/11.5 cm fish.

Four immune related genes, il-1b1 (IL-1b1), tnf-a
(TNF-a), mx (Mx) and cox-2 (COX-2), were also examined (Figure 7). IL-1b, TNF-a and COX-2 are key mediators of the inflammatory response [47], while Mx
proteins are members of the type I interferon (IFN)inducible genes, and play a role in anti-viral defenses in
teleosts [48]. The expression of IL-1b1 and TNF-a was
quite similar with strong expression observed in only
one individual of the 4.2 g/7.15 cm fish. Only very weak
expression of these genes was observed in other fishes
at different stages. The expression of Mx increased during the three developmental stages examined, while the
expression of COX-2 was quite variable among individual fishes and development stage.

Discussion
Structure of the duplicated IgH loci, IGH-A and -B

Mammalian IgH loci do not have any CH genes located
upstream of Cμ genes. Recently, however, a novel CH

were also examined. Ubiquitin is an internal control.

gene located upstream of Cμ and Cδ genes has been
found in the IgH locus of zebrafish, rainbow trout and
fugu [21-23]. In the stickleback IgH locus, a cluster of
Cτ-Cμ-Cδ was found duplicated three times in tandem,
with an additional Cτ gene in the 3’ end of the locus
[28,29]. Similarly, the catfish IgH locus contains three
linked pairs of Cμ and Cδ genes, but a CH region
upstream of Cμ and Cδ genes similar to IgT has not
been found in that locus [25,26] (Figure 8). In this study
we confirmed that two duplicated IgH loci can functionally coexist and further found that several novel CH
(Cτ) genes exist between the VH and Cμ region of the
duplicated Atlantic salmon IgH loci, five in IGH-A and
three in IGH-B. Therefore, the Atlantic salmon duplicated IgH loci are the only IgH loci so far known, in

Page 10 of 16

which multiple Cτ genes are spread out over the region
upstream of Cμ. Of these Cτ genes, two Cτ genes in
IGH-A (CτA -4 and CτA -5) and one Cτ gene in IGH-B
(Cτ B -2) are functional (Figure 8). These three genes
were recovered in cDNA clones associated with VH, D
and JH sequences. Interestingly, the CτA-4 gene is in the
inverse orientation as has also been observed with the
Ca genes in duck and chicken [49,50]. In addition, the
inverted CτA-4 gene is found associated with VH and D
sequences both 5’ and 3’ of the constant sequence, and
the CτA-4 gene was the most frequently used Cτ gene in
our present analysis of VH rearranged cDNAs. Thus,
the Atlantic salmon expresses seven kinds of CH genes,
three functional Cτ genes (CτB-2, CτA-4 and CτA-5), in
addition to the two previously known Cμ genes (CμA

Figure 8 Schematic structures of IgH loci of the Atlantic salmon and other vertebrates (not to scale). The Atlantic salmon duplicated IgH
loci, IGH-A (670 kb) and IGH-B (710 kb), were completely sequenced in this study. The diagram of the IgH locus of zebrafish (175 kb), stickleback
(175 kb) and human (1, 250 kb) are modified from references, [21,28,29] and [14], respectively. To date, only 3’ end regions of approximately
100 kb in the rainbow trout [22] and 260 kb in the catfish [25]IgH locus have been sequenced. In the catfish locus, linkage among IGH1, IGH2
and IGH3 was established by restriction mapping and Southern blot analyses [26,82]. The complete sequences of the catfish IGH2, IGH3 and the
upstream of IGH1 VH region have not yet been reported. Therefore, these regions are shown in gray boxes. The continuous regions are
indicated by dotted lines, while the gap regions are indicated by double slashes (//). Dashed-line boxes indicate the CH pseudogenes (ψ).
Transcription directions are shown by arrowhead.

and CμB) and Cδ genes (CδA and CδB)[17,31] (Figure 2
and Figure 8).
In the zebrafish and fugu IgH loci, VH genes are
located upstream of the Dζ1 (zebrafish) or DH1 (fugu)
segment [21,23]. However, both IgH loci in Atlantic salmon (Figure 1 and Figure 8) and the rainbow trout IgH
locus [22] also have VH genes between the Cτ and Cμ
genes, suggesting that these additional VH regions arose
in the family Salmonidae. Interestingly, the Atlantic salmon VH region that contains the VH sequences coincides with the region that contains a large number of
“Nhe I” elements, piggyBAC-like sequences (Figure 1)
that are also highly concentrated in the V region of the
Atlantic salmon TRA/TRD locus [37]. We postulate that
these elements are involved in the generation and diversification of the large number of V segments of the
Atlantic salmon IgH loci and TRA/TRB locus.
The two Atlantic salmon IgH loci contain over 300
VH genes, 99 VH sequences in IGH-A and 103 VH
sequences in IGH-B were characterized in this study.
These Atlantic salmon VH genes could be grouped into
18 families, based on >75% nucleotide identity (Figure
3). This is the largest number of VH families currently
defined in any vertebrate. However, it includes a high
number of pseudogenes (>68%). The proportion of
pseudogenes is quite different among vertebrate species.
The mouse locus contains 56% (110/195) functional
genes [51], while human have 36% (44/123) [52]. In teleosts, the zebrafish locus contains 47 VH genes, of which
36 are presumed functional (77%) [21]. In catfish, there
are 165 - 200 VH segments as estimated by Southern
blotting, and the analysis of 10% of the germline VH
genes suggested that approximately 50% are pseudogenes [53]. Although a large number of VH genes in the
Atlantic salmon are pseudogenes, some of these pseudo
VH genes were expressed. It is unclear whether these
pseudo VH genes may play a functional role.
Structural differences between IGH-A and -B

We found some structural differences between the two
parallel IgH isoloci in Atlantic salmon. The orientation
of the VH sequences indicates some rearrangement
within the loci and an approximately 200 kb inversion
event is evident in the IGH-A locus when comparing
the IGH-A and IGH-B sequence (Figure 1 and Additional file 4). This inversion event, which ranges from
approximately position 480 kb to 680 kb (in Figure 1)
explains the inverse orientation of the CτA-4 sequence
in IGH-A. In addition, three VH families, families 13, 14
and 18 were found only in IGH-A (Figure 3). An additional group of three D segments associated with the Cμ
gene exists in the IGH-A locus (see Additional file 9).
The amino acid sequence of CμB has an extra cysteine
residue near the C-terminal end as described previously

Page 11 of 16

by Hordvik et al. (2002) [35] (see Additional file 5). This
additional cysteine in CμB is absent in Cμ of rainbow
trout [35]. Moreover, the amino acid sequence identities
between the rainbow trout Cτ and the Atlantic salmon
CτAs (CτA -4 and CτA-5) is higher (80 - 82%) than the
similarity between the rainbow trout Cτ and the Atlantic
salmon Cτ B (Cτ B -2) (75%). In addition, phylogenetic
analysis indicates that CτAs are more closely related to
the rainbow trout Cτ than to CτB (see Additional file 6).
It has been reported that both duplicated IgD genes in
Atlantic salmon have a tandem duplication of Cδ2-Cδ3Cδ4 [17,38]. While our present study shows that these
three exons (Cδ 2 -Cδ 3 -Cδ 4 ) are indeed repeated three
times in IGH-A, they are repeated four times in IGH-B
(Figure 2). These observations indicate that both IGH-A
and -B loci have evolved independently in the short
time after the recent genome duplication. Thus, the
existence of two parallel IgH isoloci in Atlantic salmon
has contributed to the extensive diversity of the antibody repertoire.
Atypical VH -D-JH -Cδ rearrangements in Atlantic salmon

Analysis of the RT-PCR products amplified using primers specific for Cδ and for VH genes showed that
there were a large number of different (unexpected)
band sizes and some multiple bands in PCR product
from one set of primers (data not shown), indicating
that various types of VH-D-JH-Cδ rearrangements exist
in Atlantic salmon. The teleost IgD gene is expressed as
a chimeric transcript that includes the first exon of IgM
gene (Cμ1), because the teleost first exon of IgD (Cδ1)
does not contain an appropriate cysteine expected to
form the disulfide bond with the L chain [16-20]. Unexpectedly, analysis of the Atlantic salmon IgD VH cDNA
clones revealed that approximately 10% of the IgD transcripts do not include the Cμ1 sequence, showing that
the Atlantic salmon IgD can be expressed as both a chimera and without the inclusion of the Cμ1 sequence.
Recently, it has been reported that either of the Cμ1 and
Cδ1 exons could be observed in expressed porcine IgD
cDNA sequences (VDJ-Cμ1-hinge region (H)-Cδ2-Cδ3 or
VDJ-C δ1-H-Cδ2-C δ3) [54]. The porcine genomic Cδ1
exon is highly similar to the Cμ 1 exon with only 4
nucleotides difference. Both the Cδ1 and Cμ1 exons contain three cysteines, only one of which becomes part of
the IgD transcript and interacts with the L chain. In
contrast, the amino acid sequences of the Atlantic salmon Cδ1 exons are quite different from that of the Cμ1
exons. In addition, the Cδ1 exon lacks the cysteine, similar to other teleosts [17]. Therefore, the functionality of
these non-chimeric IgD transcripts is questionable. In
fact, these non-chimeric IgD transcripts generally do not
use the normal splice and recombination signals. In
many of these non-chimeric IgD transcripts, joining

Yasuike et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:486
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/486

takes place from somewhere inside or just after the VH
sequence to various distributed sites inside exon 1, 2, or
3 of the Cδ sequence. In many of these instances, a
short repeat sequence is present at the two joined ends
(Table 2). We cannot at this time exclude the possibility
of PCR artifacts contribute to these atypical VH-D-JHCδ sequences. However, because they are only observed
with Cδ and not with Cτ and Cμ, we assume that it is
not very likely. It will be of interest, in future studies, to
discover the functions of these unusual IgD transcripts.
Ig genes in Atlantic salmon

Teleost IgM molecules exist in both secreted and membrane-bound forms. The membrane forms of teleost
IgM splice the transmembrane (TM1) exon directly to
the Cμ 3 exon splice site because of lack of a cryptic
splice site within Cμ4 exon [55]. The Atlantic salmon
and other teleost IgD have been identified as membrane
IgD transcripts only [16,18,19,38]. In contrast, the catfish
IgH locus encodes both membrane and secreted Cδ
genes, and a secreted IgD molecule is identified in the
serum of catfish [56]. However, the catfish secreted IgD
molecule is encoded by a pseudo IGHM-IGHD locus
and may not contain a functional VH region [26]. We
found cDNAs encoding secreted and membrane-bound
forms of the three functional IgTs in the Atlantic salmon EST database [42], indicating that these three IgTs
exist in both the secreted and membrane-bound forms
as has also been observed with the IgTs of zebrafish,
rainbow trout and fugu [21-23]. Unlike teleost membrane-bound IgM, the membrane-bound forms of these
three IgTs transcripts include Cτ4 exons as found in the
IgTs of zebrafish and rainbow trout [21,22].
The novel Ig class (IgT), found in zebrafish, rainbow
trout and fugu, possesses its own complement of D and
JH segments [21-23]. This organization resembles that
seen in the mouse TRA/TRD locus [21]. Similarly, each
of the three functional Atlantic salmon IgTs has its own
complement of D and JH segments (Figure 1 and Figure
8). In mammals, antigen-reactive B cells make antibodies of a single type as according to the “one cell-one
antibody” rule [57]. If this rule applies to Atlantic salmon, a single B cell should only express one kind of Ig
class from the three different IgTs or IgM, because
these Igs have different D and JH segments. Li et al.
(2006) found that the gene encoding the rainbow trout
IgT was expressed only in IgM- peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs), indicating that those IgT+IgM- cells represent a unique subset of lymphocytes [58]. Therefore, the
Atlantic salmon may possess three different IgT+IgM- B
cell and IgT-IgM+ B cell populations. If so, the mechanism of expression of the Atlantic salmon IgTs differs
from the mammalian “class switch recombination”
mechanism. However, it is not known whether or not

Page 12 of 16

the Atlantic salmon B cells only express single IgT or
IgM. Further study on the Atlantic salmon B cells will
provide new insights into the evolution of B cells in
vertebrates.
Expression of the three novel IgT isotypes in Atlantic
salmon

The expression of the four innate-immune related genes
was variable among individual fishes and development
stages, while the expression of Ig genes were quite similar among individual fishes and developmental stages
(Figure 7). The expression of the IgM, IgD and four
innate immune-related genes were detected in the earliest stage (0.2 g/2.05 cm fish). On the other hand, the
expression of the three IgTs was negative or very weak
in the earliest stage (Figure 7), suggesting that the
Atlantic salmon IgTs are involved in the more mature
developmental stage than the IgM and IgD.
As mentioned above, three intact Cτ genes (Cτ A -4,
CτA-5 and CτB-2,) were found in Atlantic salmon. The
Cμ and Cδ genes, respectively, show a high degree of
amino acid identities between IGH-A and IGH-B (96%
~) [17,31]. In contrast, the three intact Cτ genes (CτB-2,
Cτ A -4 and Cτ A -5) exhibit significant sequence divergence at the amino acid level not only between loci but
also within a locus (IGH-A) (see Additional file 5). The
per cent amino acid identities between the CτA (CτA-4
and Cτ A -5) and Cτ B (Cτ B -2) sequences is 75-76, and
between Cτ A -4 and Cτ A -5 is 87. RT-PCR analyses
revealed different tissue distribution patterns among
these three IgTs (Figure 6). In addition, the expression
pattern of IgT-A4 was quite different from the other
two IgTs during the three early developmental stages
tested. The expression of IgT-A4 was not detected in
the 16.2 g/11.5 cm fish (Figure 7). The high degree of
amino acid diversity and the differential expression patterns among three Cτ genes suggest that the three different IgTs may have different functions.
Interestingly, in our present RT-PCR analysis, the
IgTs, especially IgT-A5, were highly expressed in the
mucosal tissues, including gut or gills (Figure 6). The
fugu IgT mRNA was also strongly expressed in goblet
cells of the intestine and gill epithelium [23]. In mammals, the mucosal surfaces constitute the first defensive
line against invading microbial pathogens. The specific
immunological defense at this site is primarily mediated
by IgA antibodies [59,60]. Although the structure of the
Xenopus laevis IgX is quite different from the mammalian IgA, the IgX is considered an analog of IgA because
its association with the mucosae of the intestine resembles that of IgA [61]. In teleosts, no typical mucosal Ig
class such as the IgA and IgX has been identified, but
small amounts of IgM is present in gut mucus of several
teleosts [62-64]. However, Hatten et al. (2001) have

Yasuike et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:486
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/486

reported that IgM is not present in gut mucus of Atlantic salmon, and the gut mucus contains a large amount
of proteolytic enzymes able to degrade serum IgM [65].
Their results suggested that antibodies related to the gut
of the Atlantic salmon should be of another, yet unidentified, Ig class. Because the three new IgTs identified in
our present study were found to be highly expressed in
mucosal tissues, these IgTs might form the mucosal Ig
class in Atlantic salmon.

Conclusions
The present study shows that the genomic organization
of the duplicated IgH loci in Atlantic salmon differs
from that in other teleosts. The loci possess multiple Cτ
genes upstream of the Cμ region, with three of the Cτ
genes being functional. Moreover, the duplicated loci
possess over 300 VH segments which could be classified
into 18 families. This is the largest number of VH
families currently defined in any vertebrate. Our results
indicate that the duplication of the IgH loci in Atlantic
salmon contributes heavily to the increases in diversity
of the antibody repertoire, as compared with the single
IgH locus in other vertebrates. Previous studies of the
Atlantic salmon TRA/TRD and TRG loci revealed that
Atlantic salmon clearly has one of the largest TCR
repertoires known for any vertebrate [66,67]. Much
more comprehensive analyses of Ig and TCR repertoires
in Atlantic salmon can use the method of Warren et al.
(2009) [68]. Atlantic salmon have both freshwater and
saltwater phases in their life cycles. Therefore, Atlantic
salmon is exposed to a wider variety of pathogens from
these two different environments. Thus, the large diversity of antigen receptors in Atlantic salmon may have
evolved to protect against such a wide variety of pathogens. Further study on the biological significance of the
Igs and TCRs will provide unique insight into the evolution of the adaptive immune system in vertebrates.
Methods
Sequencing of Atlantic salmon IGH-A and -B loci

The Atlantic salmon IGH-A and -B loci were isolated
and sequenced as previously described [66,67]. An
Atlantic salmon BAC library (CHORI-214), constructed
from a Norwegian aquaculture male strain, was obtained
from BACPAC Resources, Children’s Hospital Oakland
Research Institute (CHORI) [69]. Six BAC library filters
were hybridized with three (Cμ, Cδ and Cτ) 70-mer
oligo probes (Integrated DNA Technologies) that were
5`-end-labeled with 32P-ATP using T4 polynucleotide
kinase (Invitrogen). The labeled probes were added to
BAC filters that had been pre-hybridized at 65°C for 4 h
(5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt’s, 0.1% SDS). The hybridization
was carried out overnight at 65°C. Three washes were
performed, each for 30 min at 50°C; the first consisting

Page 13 of 16

of 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS, and the second and third
each consisting of 1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS. Filters were
visualized using BioMax film (Kodak). BAC clones were
chosen based on the physical BAC fingerprint map for
Atlantic salmon [70] that is publicly available on the
internet Contig Explorer (iCE) version 3.5 [71]. The
BAC end sequence information, that is available in
ASalBase [72], was also used for selection of the BAC
clones. BAC shotgun libraries were constructed and
sequenced on an ABI 3730 DNA sequencer, each of
which was assembled using PHRED and PHRAP [73,74]
and Consed [75].
The Dotter program [76] was used extensively to identify sequence elements. Sequence alignments were performed with ClustalW [77] and phylogenetic trees
generated with MEGA3.1 [78] using the Unweighted
Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA),
pairwise deletion, and a p-distance model. Gene families
were defined at 75% identity, as per the World Health
Organization-International Union of Immunological
Societies (WHO-IUIS) Nomenclature Subcommittee
guidelines [79]. Genes flanking the loci were identified
for IGH-B with the Digit Web Server [80].
The sequence of the IGH-A and IGH-B loci were
deposited in Genbank under accession numbers, IGH-A
[GenBank:GU129139], IGH-B [GenBank:GU129140] and
the other IGH-A allele [GenBank:GU321975 GU321980]. The nucleotide sequences for the Cμ, Cδ
and Cτ probes were based on EST sequence data and
are provided in Additional file 13.
Cloning and sequencing of VH cDNAs

Adult Atlantic salmon (Mowi stock) tissues were
obtained from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans
(Robert Devlin, WestVan Lab., West Vancouver, British
Columbia). Adult fish were euthanized, followed by
rapid dissection of tissues. Tissues were flash frozen in
liquid nitrogen or dry ice and stored at -80°C until RNA
extraction. Total RNA was extracted from the kidney
and spleen of two healthy individuals using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen). Purified total RNA (1.0 μg) was
reverse transcribed with SuperScript™ II (Invitrogen)
using oligo (dT)15 primer as described in the manufacture’s protocol. The cDNAs were synthesized in 25 μl
reactions incubated at 42°C for 90 min and the transcriptase heat-inactivated at 70°C for 30 min. Equal
amounts of each cDNA were combined and the mixture
used as PCR template.
One hundred seventy eight (178) forward primers
were designed from VH sequences identified for one or
several VH sequences per primer (generally as part of a
family). The reverse primers were designed from the
consensus sequence of Cμ, Cδ, and Cτ. For increased
specificity, nested primers were also designed from the

Yasuike et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:486
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/486

consensus sequence of IGH-A and -B locus for Cμ and
Cδ genes, and from the four different forms of Cτ genes.
These nested primers were located in the first exon of τ
(Cτ1 ), and in the second exon of μ (Cμ2 ) and δ (Cδ2 ).
The PCR primers used in this study are shown in Additional file 13. PCRs were performed using GoTaq DNA
polymerase (Promega) with an initial denaturation of 2
min at 95°C and then 30 cycles at 30 s of denaturation
at 95°C, 30 s of annealing at 55°C, and 1 min of extension at 72°C. PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1
(TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Twelve (12) clones from each positive
PCR product were sequenced as described above.
Sequences obtained from Cμ and Cτ genes were
sequenced in single forward direction, while the longer
sequences that include the Cδ gene were sequenced in
both forward and reverse directions. We only analyzed
the results where the two reads could form a contig
with a 100% overlap. The cDNA sequences were BLAST
searched against the VH, JH and CH gene sequences to
identify their presence in the clones.
RT-PCR analysis of Ig genes expression

Twelve different Atlantic salmon tissues from three different adult fish were provided by the Department of
Fisheries and Oceans. Immature and juvenile stages of
fish were provided by Marine Harvest Canada (Big Tree
Creek Hatchery, Sayward, B.C.) Total RNA was extracted
and reverse transcribed using the method described
above for tissues (kidney and spleen) from two individuals for three different development stages, as well as
tissues from three individual adult fish (kidney, muscle,
skin, gut, gill, spleen, brain, heart, gonad, liver, eye and
pyloric caeca). PCR primers were designed from the consensus sequence of IGH-A and IGH-B locus for Cμ and
Cδ genes, and four different forms of Cτ genes. The primers correspond to sequences in the first and third exon
for Cμ and Cτ genes, and in the fifth and seventh exon
for Cδ gene. Ubiquitin was used as internal positive control. In addition, four immune related genes, interleukin
(IL)-1b1, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a, Mx and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, were also examined. The PCR primers used in this study are shown in Additional file 13.
PCR was performed using GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega) with an initial denaturation step of 2 min at 95°C
and then 30 or 35 cycles as follows: 30 s of denaturation
at 95°C, 30 s of annealing at 55°C and 1 min of extension
at 72°C. The PCR products derived from each primer set
were TA-cloned and confirmed by sequencing. The PCR
products were electrophoresed on a 1.0% agarose gel.
The intensity of the amplification bands was semi-quantitatively measured using ImageJ software [81], and divided
by the intensity of the respective ubiquitin signals.
