Missing genes in the annotation of prokaryotic
genomes
Andrew S Warren1,2*, Jeremy Archuleta2, Wu-chun Feng2, João Carlos Setubal1,2*

Abstract
Background: Protein-coding gene detection in prokaryotic genomes is considered a much simpler problem than
in intron-containing eukaryotic genomes. However there have been reports that prokaryotic gene finder programs
have problems with small genes (either over-predicting or under-predicting). Therefore the question arises as to
whether current genome annotations have systematically missing, small genes.
Results: We have developed a high-performance computing methodology to investigate this problem. In this
methodology we compare all ORFs larger than or equal to 33 aa from all fully-sequenced prokaryotic replicons.
Based on that comparison, and using conservative criteria requiring a minimum taxonomic diversity between
conserved ORFs in different genomes, we have discovered 1,153 candidate genes that are missing from current
genome annotations. These missing genes are similar only to each other and do not have any strong similarity to
gene sequences in public databases, with the implication that these ORFs belong to missing gene families. We
also uncovered 38,895 intergenic ORFs, readily identified as putative genes by similarity to currently annotated
genes (we call these absent annotations). The vast majority of the missing genes found are small (less than 100 aa).
A comparison of select examples with GeneMark, EasyGene and Glimmer predictions yields evidence that some of
these genes are escaping detection by these programs.
Conclusions: Prokaryotic gene finders and prokaryotic genome annotations require improvement for accurate
prediction of small genes. The number of missing gene families found is likely a lower bound on the actual
number, due to the conservative criteria used to determine whether an ORF corresponds to a real gene.

Background
Genome annotation is a crucial step for the extraction
of useful information from genomes. Yet, despite more
than a decade of intensive efforts directed at improving
annotation tools and at obtaining new experimental
results, available annotations still suffer from a number
of serious problems. The main problems regarding protein-coding genes, found in every single genome, include
[1-3]: the presence of numerous bona-fide genes without
any functional assignment (the so-called “hypothetical
genes”); the presence of genes that are mis-annotated or
with annotations that are too general to be of any use;
and the possible existence of real genes that have gone
undetected. In this work we address this last problem
for the case of prokaryotes.
Gene prediction in prokaryotes typically involves
evaluating the coding potential of genomic segments

which are delimited by conserved nucleotide motifs.
The most widely used gene finding programs build a
gene model based on the characteristics of sequences
which are likely to be real genes [4-6]. This model is
then used to evaluate the likelihood that an individual
segment codes for a gene. In using this method it is
possible to miss genes with anomalous sequence composition. Another popular method for locating genes is
to compare genomic segments with a database of gene
sequences found in other organisms [7]. If the
sequence is conserved (the similarity is statistically significant) across multiple genomes, the segment being
evaluated is likely to be a coding gene [8] (this is the
“similarity method”). Genes that do not fit a genomic
pattern and do not have similar sequences in current
annotation databases may be missed. If this problem
occurs frequently in genome annotation projects, then
many such genes may be missing from current prokaryotic annotation databases.

Finding missing or “hidden” genes in an organism will
give us a more complete picture of the functional capabilities of that organism. If the organism is a pathogen, then
we may be better able to control the disease it causes; if
the organism is beneficial, we may be able to understand
better its metabolism and hence improve its “efficiency”.
In any case finding all genes in a given organism improves
our knowledge of the repertoire of protein-coding genes
found in nature, which can lead to other discoveries.
One way to detect these missing genes is to use the
similarity method to compare genomes against each other.
If gene a in genome A and gene b in genome B have been
missed and a is similar to b, then both may be found by
comparing A to B. However, to find genes that have been
systemically missed in a large annotation database such as
GenBank requires a comparison of the entire prokaryotic
database of genomes against itself. The computational cost
of this task can be prohibitive. We have developed a methodology that has allowed us to tackle this problem. To our
knowledge ours is the first large-scale attempt at identifying these missing genes in the whole of prokaryotic GenBank. We have obtained results that strongly indicate that
indeed there are non-negligible numbers of genes that are
being systemically missed.

Methods
Our basic idea is to compare all Open Reading Frames
(ORFs) greater than or equal to a minimum length from
all fully-sequenced genomes using BLAST [9] based on
a novel high-performance approach [10].

Page 2 of 12

The basic genomic unit is the replicon (which can be
a chromosome or a plasmid in prokaryotes). We
obtained 1,297 prokaryotic replicon sequences belonging
to 780 different genomes from the National Center for
Biotechnology Information’s RefSeq repository [11]. For
each replicon we generated all maximal Open Reading
Frames (ORFs) with size ≥ 99 bp by a linear scan of
each replicon using start codons ATG, GTG, and TTG.
These ORFs are said to be maximal because we choose
the start codon that is furthest from the stop codon,
without including another in-frame stop.
By comparing the coordinates of each ORF in the
genomic sequence with its current annotation, we separate ORFs into three groups: (1) those that coincide
with currently annotated genes; (2) those that overlap
with an annotated gene or other annotated entity, e.g.
RNA genes, pseudogenes, etc. (entity-overlapping ORFs);
and (3) those that do not share genomic space with any
annotated entity (intergenic ORFs). All ORFs were translated into amino acid sequences and used to construct a
BLASTP sequence similarity search. ORFs from group 3
were used as queries and all three groups were used to
create the subject database. The process for creating the
queries and the subject database is shown in Figure 1.
When an ORF was found to overlap a segment of the
genome occupied by another annotation, its sequence
was scanned for another start codon closer to the 3’ end
that would remove the overlap but maintain an ORF
length above the minimum 99 bp. This prevents ORFs
from being classified as entity-overlapping because a

false overlap was created as a result of using the most
upstream start codon by default.
The BLASTP search was performed using mpiBLAST
on Virginia Tech’s System X supercomputer [12]. mpiBLAST parallelizes BLAST using database fragmentation, query segmentation [13], parallel input-output [14],
and advanced scheduling [15]; further details are given
in [10]. The BLAST search used approximately 10,000
CPU hours on System X with 15 groups of 9 CPUs running continuously between 48 and 96 hours.
The resulting alignments were then scanned for evidence of potential genes that are not represented in any
of the current genome annotations (missing genes) and
for gene calls that were absent in the original annotation. Alignments were screened using an e-value cutoff
of 10-5, requiring alignment coverage for both the query
and subject sequences of at least 80%, and setting the
maximum number of alignments per query to 1000. The
number of alignments was used to limit output file size;
additional checks (described below) were carried out to
ensure that this limit did not compromise results.
Using the alignment data from the BLASTP search
our method labels each query as a missing gene, an
absent annotation, genomic artifact, or as an unclassified
ORF. Assignment of the missing gene label is a twostage screening process. The first stage is an evaluation
of the alignment scores and the taxonomy of subjects to
which the query ORF aligns. The second stage clusters
ORFs together based on a subset of the BLASTP alignments as detailed below.
Stage 1

During Stage 1 a query ORF is labeled as an absent annotation, genomic artifact, or classified as a “potentially
missing gene.” If a query ORF (by definition an intergenic
sequence) aligns significantly to another intergenic
sequence, then it is considered “potentially missing”. If a
query ORF aligns to an annotated gene then it is classified as an absent annotation in the genome to which it
belongs. If the query ORF aligns to an entity-overlapping
ORF then it is classified as a genomic artifact. ORFs
labeled as genomic artifact represent two possibilities.
Their presence could indicate an annotation error in the
replicon they align to (the ORF it aligns to is a real gene
and the overlapping gene is a false prediction); or it is an
alignment to a “shadow ORF” [16]. Either way, such
cases were not the target of this study. Query ORFs that
are not assigned to any of the above groups are labeled
“unclassified.” Additional file 1, Table S1 summarizes the
criteria for classifying ORFs.
Because organisms that are close phylogenetically will
have similar intergenic sequences due to lack of divergence, we require alignments that support a “potentially
missing” classification to have subject and query sequences

from two different taxonomic families, as given by organismal taxonomy in RefSeq records. In this case taxonomy is
being used as a proxy for phylogenetic distance and the
satisfaction of this requirement is the main evidence we
use for distinguishing sequences that are likely to be real
genes from sequences that represent some other conserved element. Our experience suggests that a requirement based on differing species would not be satisfactory,
because there are prokaryotes classified as different species
with very similar genomic sequences (for example, Brucella species [17]). Moreover the species and genera levels
of classification have been shown to be highly variable in
prokaryotes [18-21]. As such, we use the next highest
taxonomic level, the family. As an additional check on sufficient phylogenetic separation, we use the MUM index
[22] to score the results as described below.
The phylogenetic requirement is not used for labeling
ORFs as “absent annotations” or “genomic artifact.” This
means that many more alignments are considered in
classifying an ORF as “not missing” compared to “missing”, which makes the final “missing gene” classification
a much more conservative one. Any alignments to an
annotated gene or to an entity-overlapping ORF by an
ORF classified as potentially missing must have an average percent coverage value at least 20% less than the
value for the top-scoring intergenic alignment, for that
ORF be classified as a “missing gene.”
Stage 2

With absent annotations and genomic artifacts labeled in
Stage 1, we proceed to Stage 2 with additional checks to
confirm that the “potentially missing genes” are indeed
missing. In Stage 2 the sequences classified as potentially
missing are clustered into groups by using their BLASTP
alignments as input. Only the alignments that meet the
criteria in Stage 1 to qualify the ORF as potentially missing are used. We use a single-linkage approach to clustering. We say a pair of potentially missing genes are
connected if there exists an alignment between them. We
consider this relationship transitive so that if x is connected to y and y is connected to z then x is connected to
z. Clusters are then formed by grouping connected potentially missing genes together. The minimum of 80% coverage rule and the kinds of alignments used ensure that
few unrelated genes will be clustered together by this
method. Finally, the members of those clusters which
have at least two ORFs from two different taxonomic
families are labeled missing genes.
In order to provide additional information on the correctness of the missing gene classification a series of
sequence analyses were performed. After clustering, a random member was selected from each group as a representative, and its amino acid sequence was searched against
the NCBI nr-aa database using a local BLASTP with an

Warren et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:131
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/131

e-value cutoff of 10-5 and using InterProScan [23]. For
each missing gene we also used the Prodigal program [24],
provided by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, to check for
upstream ribosomal binding sites. In addition, for each
group a replicon was selected from each taxonomic family
and a genome distance metric was calculated between all
possible pairings of representatives within that group. The
average distance for each group was then computed. This
genomic distance metric is the MUM index [22] and is
based on the number of maximal unique and exact
matches (MUMs) shared by two genomes. This MUM
index, or MUMi, was shown to be highly correlated with
average nucleotide identity [25] and generate phylogenetic
trees compatible with those generated using multiplelocus sequence typing [22].
For select examples we also ran Glimmer v3.02 [5], the
EasyGene prediction service [26], and GeneMarkS [27] on
the replicon of origin, to determine whether the respective
missing gene is detected by these gene prediction programs. While there are many gene prediction programs to
choose from, we have selected Glimmer and GenMark as
they are among the most widely used and EasyGene
because of its ability to detect small genes. Within the
GeneMark family of programs we have chosen GeneMarkS because of its provision for detecting anomalous
genes. In addition, for these same examples we ran a
megablastn against NCBI’s nr-nt to ensure they align to
intergenic regions of their respective genomes.
The RefSeq files for generating the initial three classes
of ORFs and comparing them to annotations were
obtained from NCBI on 07/01/2008. The missing genes
were checked against a version of the nr-aa database
obtained on 06/09/2009 and searched using InterproScan webservice the same date. Glimmer was run using
its iterated procedure with a minimum length of 99 bp,
and the default parameters: Maximum overlap = 50 and
Score threshold ≥ 30. The EasyGene server was run
with a default parameter of R-cutoff = 2. The GeneMarkS server was also run using default settings.
Note that the classification criteria above considers
multiple pairwise alignments for each ORF. As such,
some alignments might be indicative of a different classification than the one assigned (still conforming to the
maximum e-value and minimum coverage rules). In
order to gain insight into the variety of subject alignments for a given ORF we define a uniqueness score a
for each missing gene and absent annotation classifications. The a score is a measure of the robustness of
each classification, which uses information from alignments that indicate each result class. It is calculated
based on the average percent identity I which is determined by averaging the percent identity values calculated with respect to the query and subject length. For
example the percent identity with respect to the query

Page 4 of 12

would be the number of identities in the alignment
divided by the length of the query multiplied by one
hundred. The uniqueness score is calculated as a = I1 I2, where I1 is always the highest I value from all alignments that support the classification (missing or
absent) and I2 is the highest I value from all alignments
that indicate a different classification (absent or artifact). If a query is classified as a “missing gene” and all
of its alignments are to intergenic sequences then there
is no I2 component and its a score will be equal to the
highest I 1 value. However, if there is an additional
alignment to an entity-overlapping ORF or an annotated gene whose I = 60 then a = I 1 - I 2 = 80 - 60 =
20. Thus the a score is higher for classifications supported by alignments with high average percent identity and consistent evidence for its classification. For
the missing gene classification the a score decreases if
the query sequence aligns to other annotations (indicating an absent annotation) or to ORFs that overlap
with other annotations (indicating a genomic artifact).
When calculating the a score for absent annotations,
only I values from alignments to entity-overlapping
ORFs are used for the I 2 component and so the a
score decreases only if there are alignments indicative
of the genomic artifact classification.

Results and Discussion
>In the linear scan of 1,297 prokaryotic replicons from
NCBI, 19,673,740 ORFs were generated (Figure 2). Of
these 2,296,838 were found to be previously annotated
as genes. The vast majority of the remaining ORFs
(15,993,195) were entity-overlapping ORFs. In the generated ORF set 1,383,707 were found to occur in intergenic regions and were used as queries for BLAST.
From these, our analysis has classified 1,153 ORFs as
missing genes, 38,895 as absent annotations, 121,654 as
genomic artifacts, and 1,222,005 remain as unclassified
sequences.
Figure 3, panel A, shows the distribution of a scores
for absent annotations, missing genes, and the clusters
of missing genes. The figure shows that many of the
classifications are robust with respect to a. In particular,
from the candidate group of missing genes, 477 have an
a of ≥ 80. This means that each of the sequences in this
missing genes subset is classified based on alignments
that have an average percent identity of at least 80%.
The 80% identity threshold was determined by Tian
et al. [28] to be a reasonable value above which enzymatic function can be transferred with high fidelity.
These sequences are highly conserved across a reasonable phylogenetic distance, and are therefore our highestconfidence gene predictions for missing genes. Additional
file 2, Table S2 contains details for all missing gene
predictions, sorted by decreasing a score.

The absent annotations with high a-scores may represent potential improvements to their respective annotations. Of the 38,895 absent annotations 20,413 have an
a of ≥ 80 and 8,910 have a-scores of 100. The latter are
intergenic in their replicon of origin, align only with
annotated genes despite being searched against all possible ORFs from all RefSeq prokaryotic replicons, and
have 100% identity with respect to the query and subject. One example of a currently absent annotation is an
apparent catalase-peroxidase gene from the p0157 plasmid of Escherichia coli Sakai (a major food-borne infectious pathogen [29]), located in an intergenic region
between bases 76845 and 76961 in the + strand. The
protein sequence aligns with 100% identity to peroxidase
sequences in UniProt [30] and has a strong scoring hit
for a haem catalase-peroxidase signature in PFam [31].

Catalase-peroxidase is thought to provide protection to
cells under oxidative stress [32].
The taxonomic breakdown of the missing genes
(Table 1 and Figure 4) indicates that there are many
more from the Burkholderiales order (35% of the total)
than others. As seen in Table 2 the order Burkholderiales also has the highest number of intergenic ORFs,
but the fraction of the total is much smaller (14%). The
Burkholderiales also have the second highest number of
replicons and the highest number of total nucleotide
sequences compared to the other taxonomic orders
(Table 2). This particular order also has a high average
GC content (64%), which, as Skovgaard et al. [8] notes,
increases the likelihood of long ORFs, in this case ≥ 99
bp, to occur by chance. Thus the problem of discriminating between short bona-fide genes and spurious

Gaussian function centered at each observation, instead of a box. This explains why the left and right tails extend beyond the defined bounds of

ORFs is more severe in GC-rich genomes. Of the 405
missing gene predictions from Burkholderiales, 177 (44%)
have a-scores < 80. It is likely that in our results the Burkholderiales is the order with most missing genes both
because it is more represented in terms of total genome
sequence and because it is an order (as a whole) for
which the task of gene finding is more challenging.
Zhao et al. [33,34] have shown that the average GC frequency of the third nucleotide position of codons (GC3)
in highly expressed genes, is known to average in the .80-

.90 range for several species of Burkholderiales. However
a correlation has also been shown [33] between gene
length and codon usage bias in these same species where
longer genes have higher GC3 values. As Zhao et al. suggest it is possible that selective pressure favors codons
which promote greater translational accuracy for longer
genes since the cost of producing the protein is proportional to its length. Under this assumption, shorter genes
would have reduced selective pressure on codon bias.
Indeed many of the missing genes found in Burkholderiales have a lower GC3 value than is found in the longer,
currently annotated genes. A wide variation in codon
usage bias was also found to occur among genes of
B. mallei [33], B. pseudomallei [34], and several convincing examples of missing genes from this order, suggesting there is no universal rule for establishing gene
identity based on this criteria in the Burkholderiales. The
distribution of GC3 values for missing genes of the
Burkholderiales is shown in Table 3.
The alignment-based clustering resulted in 380 groups
for the 1,153 missing genes. Using a randomly selected
member from each cluster a search using NCBI
BLASTP against nr-aa and a search using InterProScan
was performed. Of the 380 groups, 318 groups had

when searched with InterProScan. Of those 51 had predicted signal-peptide domains and 21 had transmembrane domains. In a study of small protein coding genes
in E. coli by Hemm et al. [35,36] many of the newly discovered, experimentally confirmed genes were found to
have transmembrane domains, suggesting a potential
lack of sensitivity in gene finding with respect to these
types of proteins. Interestingly, 333 groups (87.6%) did
not involve sequences from plasmids. Additional file 3,

sequences are available in additional file 5, and a further
breakdown of the predicted domains for each group is
provided in additional file 6.
An average MUMi metric was computed for each
missing gene group using representatives from each
family in that group. The vast majority of missing gene
groups had MUMi averages at the higher end of the
MUMi scale indicating that a reasonable phylogenetic
distance is represented within the majority of groups
(Table 4). The average MUMi distance for each group is
provided in additional file 3, Table S3. Of the 12 groups
with an average MUMi distance below 0.60, 8 are created from replicons of the families Bacteroidaceae and
Porphyromonadaceae of the order Bacteroidales, 3 from
Burkholderiaceae and Comamonadaceae of the order
Burkholderiales, and 1 from the families Streptococcaceae and Leuconostoc of the order Lactobacillales. All of
these groups involve ORFs from plasmid sequences as a
primary component in its missing gene classification
which is the likely cause for low MUMi distances across
family divisions. Though not all groups represent the
exact same level of internal diversity, the idea here is to
provide some assurance that the genomes involved are
less likely to suffer from identical sequences due to
recent common ancestry. No matter the qualifications
used there is no exact threshold at which sequences
conserved across genomes of a certain phylogenetic distance can be guaranteed to be protein coding genes. For

any in silico method there are likely missing genes that
will defy the criteria used. It is because of their anomalous nature that these genomic elements have gone
undetected by the traditional annotation process.
For every missing gene, we used the Prodigal program
[24] to predict ribosomal binding sites. We considered
an RBS prediction to be useful if the upstream distance
score and RBS motif score sum to a positive number
and the RBS motif length was greater than or equal to 4
nucleotides. We found that 127 missing genes had an
associated RBS, 70 groups had at least one sequence
with an RBS, and 31 groups had an RBS associated with
every gene sequence. Not all small protein coding genes
will have a traditional upstream RBS motif. When studying small protein coding genes in E. coli Hemm et al.
[35] experimentally confirmed the existence of small
protein coding genes that have convincing homologues
but no discernible RBS. The status of whether a missing
gene has an associated RBS sequence is documented in
additional file 2, Table S2.
There are 103 missing gene groups whose average a =
100. For these groups it is possible that ORFs occur
inside non-coding elements that create highly conserved
regions [37]. To test this we used MUSCLE [22] to construct multiple alignments for each group with additional
30 bp flanking regions upstream and downstream of each
ORF. Of the 103 groups, 94 had perfect conservation in
both the upstream and dowstream regions. Although
these ORFs come from regions of ultra conservation
many also contain predicted protein domains and represent an interesting phenomena among distantly related
organisms. The status of ultra conservation for these
groups is documented in additional file 3, Table S3 and
in some of the examples below.
One example of this ultra conservation is Group 7
which is composed of 6 genes in 6 replicons and were
conserved in 3 families of the order Enterobacteriales and
1 family of the order Alteromonadales. The representative amino acid sequence had no hits against the nr-aa
database and the representative nucleotide sequence of
117 bp aligned to the intergenic regions of several

Escherichia coli genome sequences, the genome sequence
of Shewanella putrefaciens CN-32, and plasmid
sequences from Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Cronobacter turicensis. The InterProScan of the
representative amino acid sequence indicated a signalpeptide domain from the SignalPHMM component. The
sequence group has an average percent identity and an
average a-score of 100. The coordinates for the representative sequence of this group, from Shewanella putrefaciens CN-32, were found to fall between gene calls made
by EasyGene, Glimmer, and GeneMarkS.
Another example of this ultra-conservation comes
from Group 306 which is composed of 2 genes from the
families Comamonadaceae and Burkholderiaceae of the
order Burkholderiales. The amino acid sequence from
Delftia acidovorans SPH-1 has no hits when searched
against the nr-aa database and the corresponding
nucleotide sequence (123 bp) only aligned to intergenic
regions of the Ralstonia pickettii, Delftia acidovorans,
and Ralstonia metallidurans genomes. The amino acid
sequence was found to have a nitrite reductase (large
subunit) protein domain via InterProScan. The sequence
group has an average a-score of 100. The coordinates
for the representative sequence were found to fall
between two gene calls made by EasyGene and GeneMark and partially overlap a call made by Glimmer.
One possible reason that short genes are missed in their
respective genomes, aside from their length, is because
they are foreign in origin and do not have the typical
sequence characteristics of other protein coding genes
within the organism. This appears to be the case for
Group 20 which is composed of 4 genes from the 4 different orders Pseudomonadales, Burkholderiales, Sphingomonadales, and Xanthomonadales. The amino acid sequence
from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA7 has no hits against the
nr-aa database. Though this group does not have a traditional upstream RBS motif or known protein domains, it
is conserved across four different orders of bacteria and its
representative nucleotide sequence (102 nt) aligns only to
intergenic regions in the respective genomes of origin.
This gene was found to be consistently flanked by a phage
related integrase protein in each genome and for the copy

Page 9 of 12

in the Burkholderiales genome it has a GC content of 0.38
which is uncharacteristically low. All this suggests that it
may be foreign in origin. The group has an average alphascore of 90. The coordinates for the representative
sequence of this group were found to fall between gene
calls made by Glimmer, GeneMarkS, and EasyGene.
Another group of interest is Group 338 which has 2
genes from the families Shewanellaceae and Pseudoalteromonadaceae of the order Alteromonadales. The representative amino acid sequence from Pseudoalteromonas
atlantica T6c did not have any hits when searched against
the nr-aa database and the nucleotide sequence (150 nt)
only aligned to intergenic regions of the two genomes. In
addition an RBS motif was found upstream of both
sequences using the Prodigal program [24]. A transmembrane region and signal-peptide domain were detected by
InterProScan. The group has an average a-score of 59.
The coordinates for the representative sequence of this
group were predicted by Glimmer and GeneMarkS and
fell between the predictions made by EasyGene.
Group 32 is composed of 3 genes, 2 from the order
Xanthomonadales and 1 from Burkholderiales. The representative amino acid sequence from Xylella fastidiosa 9a5c
did not have hits when searched against nr-aa and the
nucleotide sequence (141 nt) only aligned to an intergenic
region of the Xylella genome. As seen in the multiple
alignment in Figure 5 the sequences from Xanthomonas
campestris and Acidovorax sp. JS42 suggest a region of
high conservation with an embedded ORF that occurs by
chance. However, the sequence from Xylella does not
maintain this high level of conservation in the downstream
region or in the ORF sequence. In addition, an RBS motif
was found upstream of all three sequences suggesting that
this may be a real gene that happens to fall in a region of
high conservation in two of the three organisms. The
group has an average a-score of 88. The coordinates for
the representative sequence of this group were predicted
by Glimmer and GeneMarkS and fell between the predictions made by EasyGene.
Our final example (Group 11) is composed of 5 genes
in 5 replicons and has no hits to the nr-aa database or
InterProScan. Of these 3 replicons come from Leucnostoc

(Firmicutes, Lactobacillales) and 2 Streptococcus (Lactobacillales, Streptococcaceae). The megablastn of the
140 nt sequence aligned only to the intergenic regions
of their genomic sequences. The group has an average
percent identity and an average a-score of 91. The coordinates for the representative sequence of this group,
from Leuconostoc citreum KM20, were found to fall
between two gene calls made by EasyGene and Glimmer
and partially overlap a call made by GeneMarkS.
The vast majority of missing genes and absent annotations had sizes smaller than 100 amino acids (Figure 6).
With respect to missing genes, it is likely that their shorter
length played a role in why these sequences were not
found or ignored in their respective genome annotations.
While their shorter length and lack of similarity to experimentally verified genes raises the question whether these
short ORFs are real protein-coding genes, the strong similarity, and in some cases complete identity, across different
prokaryotic families should not be ignored.

Conclusions
Our results clearly show that there are indeed likely protein-coding genes in prokaryotic genomes that have
been systemically missed. Our results of about 380 such

families in 780 genomes should be considered a lower
bound on the actual number of missing or hidden gene
families, because the criteria we have used to find them
are rather conservative. There were 1,121,362 intergenic
sequences that went “unclassified,” and such ORFs are a
clear target for finding additional genes.
The vast majority of the genes we found are small, under
100 aa (Figure 5). In addition, in the small sample we analyzed with Glimmer, EasyGene and GeneMark, we found
that these gene finders did not detect some of these potentially missing genes. If traditional indicators of protein coding genes were present for these small proteins then many
of them would already be present in the protein sequence
database. As in previous studies [35], these results suggest
that some small protein-coding genes remain a problem for
prokaryotic gene finders, in spite of the progress made by
EasyGene [4], Glimmer [5], GeneMarkS [27], and others.
And when small genes are predicted by these programs,
they run the risk of being ignored by annotation projects in
order to avoid over-prediction.
In order to find the missing genes using all fullysequenced prokaryotic genomes we have used an innovative high-performance methodology [10]. That methodology can be potentially used for other genome database-

Warren et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:131

wide surveys of sequence data. The performance of both
mpiBLAST [13] and ParaMEDIC [10] theoretically scales
well if the number of processors that are used scales as the
square of the number of replicon sequences.
Although our focus was on missing genes, the class
absent annotations is also a useful result, and could be
used to improve the annotations of genomes where they
are located.
We would like to refine our criteria for filtering candidate missing genes. In this work we have used a rather
simple filter based on the taxonomic family. Such a filter
is overly conservative in genera that contain species with
quite distinct genomic compositions, such as the Pseudomonadaceae [38]. Furthermore the NCBI taxonomy
used in this study is not an authoritative source but is
one of the few resources where this information is readily available for such a wide range of organisms. A more
sophisticated and sensitive method of screening may be
used, such as classifying sequences based on whether
the Ka/Ks ratio indicates a lack of selective pressure
[39], but it is not clear how well this will perform with
short sequences. Protein coding genes smaller than our
current 99 bp threshold are known to exist [35]. It may
be possible to refine our method to allow for the detection of genes under its current limit.
The proof that our predicted missing genes are real
genes needs to come from experimentation. Obtaining
this proof should be achievable in the near future with
the use of large-scale prokaryotic transcriptomics, made
practical, and financially viable, by next-generation
sequencing technologies [40].
