Abstract
Background: Poxviruses are important pathogens of humans, livestock and wild animals. These
large dsDNA viruses have a set of core orthologs whose gene order is extremely well conserved
throughout poxvirus genera. They also contain many genes with sequence and functional similarity
to host genes which were probably acquired by horizontal gene transfer.
Although phylogenetic trees can indicate the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer and even
uncover multiple events, their use may be hampered by uncertainties in both the topology and the
rooting of the tree. We propose to use synteny conservation around the horizontally transferred
gene (HTgene) to distinguish between single and multiple events.
Results: Here we devise a method that incorporates comparative genomic information into the
investigation of horizontal gene transfer, and we apply this method to poxvirus genomes. We
examined the synteny conservation around twenty four pox genes that we identified, or which
were reported in the literature, as candidate HTgenes. We found support for multiple independent
transfers into poxviruses for five HTgenes. Three of these genes are known to be important for
the survival of the virus in or out of the host cell and one of them increases susceptibility to some
antiviral drugs.
Conclusion: In related genomes conserved synteny information can provide convincing evidence
for multiple independent horizontal gene transfer events even in the absence of a robust
phylogenetic tree for the HTgene.

Background
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT, also: lateral gene transfer)
is an important process in viral evolution. HGT describes
an event that differs from the regular 'vertical' transfer of
genes from parent to offspring: for example, host gene
capture in viruses, where pieces of host DNA are incorporated into the newly formed virion. HGT is thought to
play a major role in evolution, as there has apparently
been frequent transfer of protein domains or entire genes

within and between all divisions of life with important
implications for molecular phylogeny studies [1-3]. Especially in pathogens these horizontally transferred genes
(HTgenes) are of enormous interest as they often increase
virulence by encoding homologs to the host's immune
system and interfering with it [4-6]. Multiple independent
horizontal gene transfer events are thus particularly significant; they highlight the advantage that is conferred on the

virus genome by a gene that has been gained and maintained several times.
Poxviruses are large double-stranded DNA viruses (up to
360 kb) that infect a wide range of hosts from insects to
mammals. They are classified into entomopox (EPV,
insect-infecting) and chordopox viruses (ChPV, vertebrate-infecting), with ChPV sub-divided into at least nine
genera. Several members of the Poxviridae are associated
with human disease, including variola (smallpox), Molluscum contagiosum and monkeypox, which has been classifed as an emerging virus [7,8] and was responsible for an
outbreak of monkeypox in the US in 2003. The most well
known poxviruses are smallpox, an orthopox virus (OPV)
responsible for devastating human pandemics until it was
declared eradicated by the WHO in 1980, and cowpox,
used in the development of the first vaccine by Edward
Jenner in 1796. Over 50 genomes have been fully
sequenced and many attempts have been made to reconstruct a robust phylogeny of poxviruses [9-12].
Poxviruses remain in the cytoplasm of the host cell and to
a large extent provide their own replication machinery.
Many of these genes are not part of a viral core set and it
is possible that they were acquired from an ancient host
cell by a poxvirus ancestor [13]. The fact that poxviruses
do not enter the nucleus poses a practical problem when
it comes to the mechanism of host gene capture: how
HGT from host to virus takes place is not yet known, but
as poxvirus genes lack introns, HGT may proceed through
reverse transcription of host mRNAs and integration of
the cDNA into the virus genome. [14]. It has recently been
suggested that certain poxviruses may act as vectors for the
transfer of transposable elements between animal phyla
[15].
There are several approaches to detecting HGT, all of
which are best used in conjunction with each other [16].
The first evidence usually comes from sequence similarity
to a gene in a distantly related organism or in the viral
host. Phylogenetic gene trees which include sequences
from both viruses and cellular organisms can also provide
an indication of host gene capture where virus genes
group closely with homologs from the host or organisms
related to the host, i.e. where gene history differs from species history [17]. Atypical base composition of a particular
gene, for example a GC content that differs significantly
from that of most other genes in the genome, provides
another piece of evidence that HGT may have recently
taken place and this approach has been used to detect
host-derived regions in poxviruses [18] and other small
genomes [19]. This signal, however, is expected to fade
over time and therefore this approach is only useful for
detecting recent HGT.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/67

These difficulties are compounded when one wishes to
test whether there have been multiple independent HGT
events of the same gene into related viruses. This may be
indicated by a polyphyletic relationship in the phylogenetic tree, but such a tree would require strong support
(e.g., high bootstrap values) for several branches in order
to be reliable – frequently this support is not there. A
mixed pattern of presence and absence of a particular gene
in a group of closely related organisms is another indication for horizontal transfer of the gene in question, but an
ancestral origin with loss in some genomes can also
explain this observation.
We use comparative gene order information to distinguish between a shared history of the HTgene in the virus
genomes and several independent transfer events. Where
a given HTgene is in an equivalent location in terms of its
neighboring genes in all of the genomes only a single
transfer event is supported. A HTgene that is located in a
different genomic region in related viruses strengthens the
case for several transfer events rather than a common origin. This is an especially strong tool in poxviruses where
the gene order is highly conserved throughout the syntenic core of the genome [9,20].
We systematically searched for evidence of HGT between
poxviruses and other organisms using strict search criteria
and identified nine candidate HTgenes, some of which
had been previously reported. We examined both the tree
topology and the genomic context for evidence of the
number of HGT events. We also applied the comparative
synteny method to several candidate horizontally transferred genes reported in the literature [11,21].

Results and Discussion
Poxvirus gene families and species phylogeny
Poxvirus genes were grouped into families based on protein sequence similarity (see Methods). 14,936 genes were
grouped into 730 families of a least three members. Of
these, 33 gene families were found in single copy in each
of the completely sequenced genomes; we labelled these
"core families" for our purposes (Table 1). A further 523
gene families were found in single copy in a subset of the
completely sequenced genomes; we labelled these
"ortholog families". Finally, 174 families were defined
that contained both orthologs and paralogs; we labelled
these "ortho-paralog families".

We used concatenated amino acid (aa) sequence alignments of the core families to estimate the poxvirus phylogeny under different reconstruction methods. The
maximum-likelihood (ML) tree of poxviruses (Figure 1)
incorporates 54 complete genomes (Table 2) and agrees
with previously reported phylogenies in terms of the relative positions of genera [9-11]. The ML and neighbor-join-

ing (NJ) trees were identical except for NJ grouping
parapox and molluscipox as sister clades with high bootstrap support. The maximum-parsimony (MP) tree agreed
with this grouping of parapox and molluscipox and also
supports capripox as the outgroup of suipox and deerpox,
rather than suipox and capripox being monophyletic as
suggested by the ML topology. Additionally, we examined
the congruence of individual gene trees with the species
tree topology depicted in Fig. 1. In most cases the gene
trees were in perfect agreement with the inferred species
tree, lending further support to the topology.
Within-genus relationships for genera with many representatives were inferred by the inclusion of as many gene
sequences as possible. For parapox, capripox and
orthopox, we aligned all ortholog families conserved in
the genus of interest (i.e. genes connected by yellow lines
in Additional File 1) and inferred trees for those genera
using ML and NJ (see Methods). NJ and ML results were
congruent and the bootstrapped ML results are shown in
Fig. 1.

Evidence for horizontal gene transfer from sequence
similarity
We identified 14 pox gene families that included at least
one member with a significant PSI-BLAST hit to a gene in
a non-pox organism (see Methods for search criteria). The
search protocol we employed is conservative and we did
not detect some previously reported non-pox homologs
of poxvirus proteins (Table 3; lower section and refs
[11,21]). However, we initially wished to confine our
gene order comparisons to genes with convincing amino
acid sequence similarity to genes found outside poxviruses. Of these 14 gene families, some did not warrant further investigation. The gag, pol and env open reading
frames found in avipox are part of a reticuloendotheliosis
virus (REV) sequence that is inserted into the pox genome
and groups with sequences from REV and other avian
viruses. While this is HGT of sorts, it is a special case where
the REV sequence can reform into infectious particles after
poxvirus infection of a chicken host [22] and these genes
were not investigated further here. The fusolin/enhancing
factor (EF) family was found to be present only in incom-

§ Previously described as polyphyletic in poxviruses
* Insufficient synteny conservation

pletely sequenced entomopox genomes and one insect
larva genome (Pseudaletia separata). The similarities
between the EF and fusolin genes of different EPV and
their detrimental effect on the host's resistance to the
viruses have been reported [23], but it appears there has
been an annotation mistake in the record of the insect
sequence [GenBank: JC5185], as the paper it refers to [23]
makes no mention of an insect sequence, and it is identical to that of the insect's EPV [GenBank: BAA09138]. As
we are unsure of the veracity of the candidate host
sequence, we excluded this gene from further analysis.
Ubiquitin is also found by our search. The large number
of homologs makes further investigation difficult, and as
this protein is shared by all eukaryotes, it is likely to be
ancestral to all poxviruses. The remaining 9 protein families were studied in more detail and the HGT histories suggested by our analyses are summarised in Table 3.

Evidence from gene order comparisons
Poxviruses have extremely well conserved gene order, particularly of the core families (Additional File 1 and [9]).
We estimated the overall level of synteny conservation
throughout poxvirus genomes by considering the conservation of neighboring genes between orthologs in pox.
For these purposes we examined only genes and neighbors which had been grouped into families without paralogs and which were present in at least two complete
genomes. We considered that if a given gene always has
the same two immediate neighbors in every genome in
which it is found, then it has perfect neighbor conservation. By contrast, if the neighbors are always different,
then there is zero conservation. We measured this using
the following statistic: (M-N)/(M-2); where M is the maximum possible number of unique neighbours (i.e., different neighbors in every case) and N is the observed number

of neighbours. This will always return a value between 0
and 1. We found that 69% of ortholog families had a
neighbor conservation value of at least 0.9 and that 89%
had at least 0.7 neighbor conservation.

tances within the diagram may be quite large, however
because these are shared by all pox genomes, this view
permits a low-resolution comparison across all genera.
The second type of diagram plots the HTgene with respect
to ortholog families, which are much greater in number.
This increases the "resolution" of the plot and still avoids
the confounding effect of paralogous genes. Finally we
plot the location of the HTgene with respect to any of the
gene families and examine it with the caveat that paralogous genes may be misleading.

This conservation permits the comparison of the genomic
location of HTgenes between genomes. Shared genomic
context may also be useful for distinguishing orthologs
and paralogs in conjunction with phylogenetic trees,
though that analysis is not conducted here. These comparisons of HTgene locations are done with respect to gene
families which are shared between the genomes of interest. Depending on the extent of gene order conservation
around the HTgene between genomes it may be possible
to distinguish single from multiple transfer events (Fig. 2A
and 2B). If the local gene order is not well conserved then
a single transfer followed by genome rearrangement cannot be excluded even when the HTgene is present in a
completely different context in different genomes (Fig.
2C). Within poxvirus genera this is a particular issue when
comparing EPV gene order to that of ChPV, and to a certain degree also in comparison of avipox to other ChPV
because of the high amount of rearrangement (Additional
File 1).

We applied this analysis to the nine HTgenes uncovered
by our PSI-BLAST search and compared the results to the
scenarios supported by ML and NJ tree of the pox gene
family and the non-pox homologs. We also applied the
comparative gene arrangement analysis to candidate
HTgenes from the literature (Table 3).

We made three kinds of illustrations of the genomic context of HTgenes, distinguished by the type of gene families
that the HTgene is plotted alongside. In the first kind the
HTgene location is plotted with respect to the "core families" only. There are only 33 of these genes, so the dis-

Gene of Interest

In the case of dUTPase and Uracil DNA glycolase there
was insufficient gene order conservation to allow comparisons – this reflects the fact that many of the transfers were
into the poxvirus chromosome ends where the genome
appears to be more labile. Also, the serpin gene family
contains many paralogs within poxviruses which made
comparison of gene order between viruses intractable.
However, we found that in most cases gene order comparisons between the poxviruses can distinguish between single or multiple origins of a HTgene in poxviruses, even in
the absence of a robust phylogenetic tree. The gene location comparison provided supporting evidence for at least

Model gene order comparisons for inferring the number of horizontal gene transfer events. The relative order of
genes around the gene of interest is illustrated. Orthologous genes are shaded in the same color and lined up vertically. A
white box indicates that the gene is present in the genome, but not at the expected (i.e., equivalent) location. Horizontal lines
indicate genomic segments. Thick horizontal lines indicate that the connected genes are neighboring genes of the specified type
(where gene of interest is present) or have fewer than three intervening genes of the specified type (where gene of interest is
absent). Thin horizontal lines signify three to six intervening genes. Vertical lines separate discontiguous genomic regions. (A)
The gene of interest is in an equivalent location in all genomes where it is found. This supports a single origin (i.e., horizontal
transfer) of this gene. (B) The gene of interest is found in two different genomic locations and the relative arrangement of
other genes in each of these locations is conserved (i.e., there is no support for a local rearrangement). This supports two
independent transfers of this gene. (C) The gene of interest is found in two different genomic locations but these regions are
not conserved between genomes, so it is not possible to infer if it was a single transfer followed by genome rearrangement, or
two independent transfer events.

the synteny information is suggestive of more HGT events
than were apparent from the phylogenetic tree alone. In
other cases, such as Ribonucleotide Reductase, small subunit, the converse was true, and the synteny data indicated
that there were fewer events than did the (poorly supported) phylogenetic tree.
Interleukin-10
Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a multifunctional cytokine that
suppresses inflammation, antiviral response and other
host functions. It inhibits activation and maturation of
dendritic cells and thus reduces their antigen-presenting
ability and inhibits cytokine synthesis via T- and NK- cells.
Homologs of IL-10 have been found in many different
viruses [24-26]. Viral IL-10 has been shown to play an
important role in delaying the development of acquired
immunity to orf virus in humans [27] and to vaccinia in
mice [28]. The origin of some viral homologs to IL-10 has
been investigated and it is suggested that orf virus (a parapoxvirus) captured the gene from sheep or goat [25,29].

The NJ tree for IL-10 genes (based on their aa sequences)
found in pox and other organisms indicates that there are
two origins of this gene in poxviruses because the pox
genes group into two clades, i.e., they are polyphyletic

(Additional File 2; and [11]). However, the low bootstrap
support for the tree topology means that this tree alone
does not give strong support for multiple horizontal transfer events. In fact, the ML tree has a different topology
indicating monophyly and also has low bootstraps (Additional File 2). In this case, the lack of clarity in the phylogenetic tree possibly stems from a lack of information
within the alignment (Additional File 3), as indicated by
the low bootstrap support.
The synteny diagram with respect to core families (Fig.
3A) suggests that the canarypox IL-10 is not at the
expected location, however, these data cannot exclude the
possibility of genome rearrangement altering the location
of the canarypox IL-10 gene because the environment
observed in orthopox is broken by rearrangements in avipox.
Including more genes in the synteny comparison distinguishes the genomic locations of the yatapox and
capripox IL-10 genes as each is present in a region of
genome that is well-conserved between these pox genera
(thus permitting comparison) yet different for the two sets
of viruses (Fig. 3B), indicating distinct origins for the yatapox and capripox IL-10 genes. This same distinction was
found by Hughes based on phylogenetic analysis [11].
The IL-10 genomic locations in parapox and avipox are
not sufficiently conserved to permit comparison. However, we note that if one or both of these originated in the

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:67

same event as the yatapox or capripox IL-10 then that also
requires many loss events in other pox genera as well as a
loss and subsequent re-acquisition in either yatapox or
capripox. The gene order with respect to all neighboring
gene families (figure not shown) supports the distinction
of yatapox and capripox IL-10 but is not otherwise
informative of the history of IL-10 due to lack of significant conservation, so cannot distinguish these possibilities. We therefore infer at least two independent HGT
events of the IL-10 gene from vertebrates to poxviruses.
Thymidine Kinase
Thymidine kinase (TK) is present in many poxviruses [3032]. It phosphorylates a wide range of substrates and, surprisingly, has been found to increase susceptibility to antiviral drugs by selectively phosphorylating some
thymidine analog drugs to a greater degree than the host
TK1 gene and thus increasing the efficacy of the antiviral
drug [33]. Separate origins for avipox and orthopox TK
have been suggested based on phylogenetic evidence
[29,34] and this is supported here by the different
genomic environments in avipox and other chordopox
(Additional File 4; and [35]).

The gene order is completely scrambled in entomopox,
however, so these data do not distinguish between shared
origins for entomopox and either the avipox or other
chordopox TK genes and distinct origins (i.e., the data do
not distinguish between two or three transfer events). The
former scenario would require that the TK gene was
present in the common ancestor of all pox and subsequently lost in either avipox or the other chordopox only
to be regained independently. If the entomopox and avipox TK gene are descended from the same HGT event,
then this scenario would require three events (HGT into
pox ancestor, loss from chordopox excluding avipox, HGT
into another chordopox lineage). In a simplistic sense this
is equally parsimonious with three HGT events. A more
biologically realistic analysis should include consideration of any selection to retain, lose or acquire this gene;
properties that we do not currently know. The fact that
this gene has been acquired and retained independently at
least twice indicates that multiple HGT events are possible. Loss and reacquisition in the chordopox lineage may
indicate significant changes in the environment have
changed the nature of the selection acting on this gene.
In avipox, the TK gene and the adjacent HT-motif protein
gene (HT) are in the location occupied by ribonucleotide
reductase, large subunit (RRL) in orthopox and suipox.
This, along with reported 15 bp direct repeats flanking TK
and HT led to the suggestion that these genes transposed
within avipox to this location in avipox and replaced RRL
[36]. This suggestion is at odds with the experimental
strategy employed here because if intra-genomic translo-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/67

cations are a common occurrence it would mean that
completely distinct genomic neighborhoods are not sufficient to indicate distinct origins. However, there is no real
support for this transposition hypothesis from the many
data now available: (i) The phylogenetic evidence supports an independent origin of avipox TK; (ii) There is no
evidence that the RRL gene was ever present in avipox
because it is not found outside orthopox and suipox
(whose most recent common ancestor is not shared with
avipox); (iii) Furthermore, we cannot identify the 15 bp
repeat referred to in the 1992 paper [36] but we did identify a 12 bp direct repeat (starting nucleotide positions
87698 and 88647 in AF198100). One of the repeat copies
is inside the open reading frame of the I5L gene, which
adds the constraint that if it is the result of an insertionsite duplication then it must not have disrupted the function of this gene. The relationship of the entomopox TK
gene to the other pox TK genes remains inconclusive, with
a third independent transfer being one possibility.
We conclude from the gene order data that there were at
least two independent horizontal transfers of TK into poxviruses, and possibly a third (into entomopox). The independent transfer into the same locus of the TK gene in
avipox and the RRL gene into the ancestor of orthopox
and suipox suggests the intriguing possibility that this
genomic location has properties that make it particularly
receptive to gene transfers.
Ribonucleotide Reductase, small subunit
Ribonucleotide reductase (RR) functions as a heterodimeric tetramer and leads to the reduction of all four
ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides in DNA biosynthesis. The small subunit (RRS) was sequenced in vaccinia
and found to be highly similar to eukaryotic RSS genes,
including the mouse RSS, suggesting host gene capture
[37]. RRS is present in most chordopox genera except
parapox, molluscipox and some avipox. The avipox RRS
gene is present in a different synteny block than the RRS
gene in other chordopox (Additional File 5). These data
support two independent transfers of RRS into pox: one
into the avipox lineage, and one into the ancestor of
orthopox and clade II.
Glutathione Peroxidase
The viral glutathione peroxidase (GP) protects virus and
infected cells against oxidative damage resulting from
interaction with the immune system [38]. It is not present
in orthopox and was first identified in molluscum contagiosum virus [39]. GP is found in avipox and molluscipox
and separate transfer events have previously been suggested [11]. The synteny diagram with ortholog families
clearly shows that the gene is in an equivalent location in
all avipox genomes (Additional File 6), but is in a distinct

Page 9 of 13

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:67

location in molluscipox and thus supports independent
transfers of this gene into these two lineages.
Deoxyribodipyrimidine Photolyase
Photolyases are enzymes which catalyse the repair of UVinduced DNA damage. In poxviruses, photolyases are
implicated in the survival of the virus outside host cells in
between infections [40]. Deoxyribodipyrimidine Photolyase (DP) is found in entomopox, avipox and leporipox.
It was identified as a candidate HTgene through sequence
similarity with genes in insect and vertebrate genomes
[11]. The avipox gene lies in a region of conserved synteny
with other ChPV, but the DP gene is not at the syntenous
location in leporipox (Additional File 7). This supports
independent origins for the avipox and leporipox DP
genes. It is not possible to compare the location of the
entomopox genes with each other or with ChPV due to
insufficient synteny conservation. We conclude that there
were at least two independent transfers of DP into poxviruses.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/67

In previous studies many HTgenes were refractory to phylogenetic analysis due to difficulties rooting the trees or
insignificant support for critical branches (e.g. [11] in pox,
and [41]). Phylogenetic trees are frequently plagued by
problems which abolish their usefulness for analysis of
horizontal gene transfer [42]. Because the conserved synteny data are independent of the phylogenetic tree for the
HTgene these results could be combined.
The HTgenes with multiple origins identified here have
very interesting biological properties. The presence of viral
TK increases susceptibilty to antiviral drugs, a surprising
finding [33]. The particular benefit to the virus, if any, of
having this gene is not clear. Three other HTgenes, IL-10,
GP and DP are known to improve the survival of the virus
against the host immune system (IL-10) and environmental damage (GP and DP). In the case of these genes it is
easy to speculate that they are particularly advantageous
to the virus, and the fact that they have been successfully
transferred into poxvirus genomes on more than one
occasion lends support to this hypothesis.

Conclusion
Here we have gone beyond the comparison of the
sequences of homologous genes and have introduced
comparative synteny data into the analysis of horizontal
gene transfer. These data are completely independent of
phylogenetic tree and sequence composition data. For the
24 genes with evidence of horizontal transfer analysed
here, all but four had sufficiently conserved synteny
between poxviral genomes to permit comparison. In five
cases, the presence of the HTgene in a well-conserved, yet
distinct, region in different poxvirus genomes supported a
conclusion of multiple independent transfers of a homologous gene into Poxviridae. In the other cases, this study
confirmed that a single event gave rise to the HTgene in
poxviruses.
This strategy is based on the assumption that there is no
bias in the insertion site of a HTgene with respect to the
neighboring genes in the receiving (pox) genome. The
only known bias in terms of the location of new genes in
poxviruses is that they tend to be located towards the ends
of chromosomes [9] and this is not expected to influence
the neighbors for this analysis. More importantly, we
interpret the conservation of synteny across poxvirus
genomes as evidence against genomic rearrangement
events in that region. This means that under these circumstances we can exclude the possibility that the new
genomic location is caused by genome rearrangement
within the pox lineage rather than independent transfer
into the lineage.
A major strength of this method is that it does not rely on
phylogenetic trees (and thus multiple sequence alignments) in order to interpret the number of transfer events.

Methods
Family Definitions
We downloaded all available poxvirus proteins from GenBank in June 2006 and predicted proteins for unannotated complete genomes using the EMBOSS getorf
application [43] (total 17,185 sequences). These proteins
were compared in an all-against-all BLAST search using
default parameters [44]. We used The Markov Cluster
Algorithm (MCL) [45] to group proteins into families
with the Centering parameter set to 1.2 and the Inflation
parameter set to 1.2. These parameters were chosen after
experimentation in order to maximize the family size.
Alignments of all of these families were performed using
MUSCLE and are provided as supplementary material
(Additional File 8).
Species Phylogeny Construction
Thirty-three families were found in single-copy in every
completely sequenced poxvirus genome ("core families";
Table 1). We generated alignments of the protein
sequences of each of these genes using MUSCLE [46] and
concatenated the alignments. Based on this concatenated
sequence alignment, phylogenetic trees of 54 completely
sequenced poxviruses (Table 2) were reconstructed by different methods: NJ (PHYLIP package [47] and ClustalW
[48]), MP (PHYLIP package) and ML (PhyML package
[49]). The best models for ML analysis were estimated
using PhyML [49] by experimenting with a range of settings for several parameters (gamma parameter, substitution model, number of substitution rate categories) and
choosing the ones that gave the highest likelihood. The
JTT and TN93 models were used for protein and nucleotide alignments, respectively. To allow for bootstrap-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:67

ping, a less computationally intensive, representative
phylogeny including at most two members of each genus
was constructed. Single gene trees were also constructed
using PhyML from the 33 conserved families, and their
congruency with the concatenated gene tree was noted. To
infer within-genus relationships, ortholog families shared
by all members of a genus were aligned at the protein level
and the gaps were copied into the nucleotide sequence to
generate nucleotide (nt) alignments. The nt alignments
were concatenated and the tree of the genus was inferred
using PhyML with the TN93 model. For comparison we
also constructed the trees using NJ (with both the PHYLIP
package and ClustalW).
Detection of non-poxviral homologs
We used PSI-BLAST [50] to search all 17,815 poxvirus proteins against the GenBank non-redundant (nr) database
(May 2007; 4.9 million sequences). The e-value threshold
for inclusion in the PSSM was e-20, with a maximum of
five iterations. Only alignments of 70% identity or higher
and at least 80% length of query sequence were kept as
homologs. We selected these parameters after some experimentation with different values in order to retrieve only
strong candidates for HGT and to keep detection of false
positives to a minimum. We excluded hits to synthetic
constructs (e.g., artificial vectors).
Gene Phylogenies
The protein sequences of members of the nine gene families with PSI-BLAST hits outside poxviruses were aligned
with their non-poxviral homologs using MUSCLE [46]. NJ
trees were drawn with ClustalW [48] and bootstrapped
1000 times. ML trees were drawn with PhyML using
model JTT, proportion of invariable sites = 0, number of
substitution rate categories = 6 and estimating the gamma
distribution parameter.
Synteny Diagrams
Three kinds of comparative genomic plots were produced.
Only genes that have been classified into families are considered. (1) A low resolution plot illustrates the location
of the gene of interest in each genome with respect to
"core families". The actual distance between genes on this
plot may be quite large. (2) A medium resolution compares the location of the HTgene with respect to "ortholog
families". (3) The maximum resolution plot includes
neighboring genes from any families.

In all of these diagrams when the gene of interest is
present in a given genome, the genes plotted along side
are immediate neighbors (of the given type) with no intervening genes. That is, in the ortholog families plot, the
genes plotted are all the nearest-neighbor genes with identified orthologs in any genome.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/67

When the gene of interest is absent from a given genome,
we allowed some intervening genes and indicate this with
the thickness of the line (as per figure legend). We chose
ranges of 1–2 and 3–6 intervening genes to indicate different levels of conservation after experimenting with different values as we considered these to be the most clear and
informative.
