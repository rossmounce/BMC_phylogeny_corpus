Abstract
Background: Perkinsus marinus, a protozoan parasite of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica, has devastated natural
and farmed oyster populations along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. It is classified as a member of the
Perkinsozoa, a recently established phylum considered close to the ancestor of ciliates, dinoflagellates, and
apicomplexans, and a key taxon for understanding unique adaptations (e.g. parasitism) within the Alveolata. Despite
intense parasite pressure, no disease-resistant oysters have been identified and no effective therapies have been
developed to date.
Results: To gain insight into the biological basis of the parasite's virulence and pathogenesis mechanisms, and to
identify genes encoding potential targets for intervention, we generated >31,000 5' expressed sequence tags (ESTs)
derived from four trophozoite libraries generated from two P. marinus strains. Trimming and clustering of the sequence
tags yielded 7,863 unique sequences, some of which carry a spliced leader. Similarity searches revealed that 55% of
these had hits in protein sequence databases, of which 1,729 had their best hit with proteins from the chromalveolates
(E-value ≤ 1e-5). Some sequences are similar to those proven to be targets for effective intervention in other protozoan
parasites, and include not only proteases, antioxidant enzymes, and heat shock proteins, but also those associated with
relict plastids, such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase and methyl erythrithol phosphate pathway components, and those
involved in glycan assembly, protein folding/secretion, and parasite-host interactions.
Conclusions: Our transcriptome analysis of P. marinus, the first for any member of the Perkinsozoa, contributes new
insight into its biology and taxonomic position. It provides a very informative, albeit preliminary, glimpse into the
expression of genes encoding functionally relevant proteins as potential targets for chemotherapy, and evidence for
the presence of a relict plastid. Further, although P. marinus sequences display significant similarity to those from both
apicomplexans and dinoflagellates, the presence of trans-spliced transcripts confirms the previously established
affinities with the latter. The EST analysis reported herein, together with the recently completed sequence of the P.
marinus genome and the development of transfection methodology, should result in improved intervention strategies
against dermo disease.
Background
The protozoan parasite Perkinsus marinus is a facultative
intracellular parasite of mollusks, and the causative agent
of "dermo" disease in both wild and farmed Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) populations along the Atlantic

and Gulf coasts of the USA [1-4]. Since its initial description, P. marinus has generated substantial controversy
with regards to its taxonomic placement [5,6]. A close
relationship with the Apicomplexa was initially proposed
based on the ultrastructural analysis of the zoospore,
which revealed the presence of organelles resembling an
apical complex [7]. Molecular evidence gathered over the
following years revealed affinities with the Dinozoa [8],
and even suggested this group to be its closest extant
taxon [9,10]. More recently, however, ultrastructural similarities and molecular phylogenetic affinities to Parvilucifera sp., a parasite of microeukaryotes, led to the

establishment of the phylum Perkinsozoa, which like the
Apicomplexa, is only comprised of endoparasites [11].
This new phylum is considered to be one of the earliest
diverging groups from the lineage leading to dinoflagellates, albeit close to the ancestor from which the ciliates,
dinoflagellates, and apicomplexans originated [12-14].
Together with the various emerging diseases in the
estuarine and marine environment [15], infections by P.
marinus and other Perkinsus spp. are responsible for devastating losses in shellfisheries of economically relevant
mollusk species worldwide, including oysters, clams, and
abalone [16]. Further, given the critical role that oysters
and other filter-feeding bivalves play in maintaining environmental water quality, the dramatic declines in bivalve
populations, caused by dermo disease, have had correspondingly detrimental impacts on the estuarine environment. Although several intervention strategies have been
implemented to control dermo disease, they have had little or no success [17]. During the early 1990s, however,
the development of in vitro culture methods for P. marinus [18-20] provided a key resource that enabled studies
leading to the identification of new targets for intervention [16]. These studies ranged from fundamental cellular, biochemical, molecular and genetic studies of P.
marinus biology to the direct in vitro testing of potential
chemotherapeutic drugs that might suppress its proliferation [21-27].
The life cycle of P. marinus includes a free-living motile
stage (zoospore) and a non-motile vegetative stage (trophozoite). The parasite is ingested by the host during filter-feeding, and is then phagocytosed by hemocytes
present in the alimentary canal. Although the infection
mechanism has not been fully elucidated, once inside the
host, P. marinus trophozoites are recognized via a galectin present on the surface of phagocytic hemocytes
[28,29], internalized, and localize inside phagosome-like
structures. The phagocytosed trophozoites remain viable
by abrogating the host's respiratory burst through their
effective antioxidative machinery [30,31], and retain their
proliferative capacity [32]. Hemocyte migration throughout host tissues leads to systemic infection and eventually
death [6,33]. Therefore, in addition to those genes that
mediate intrahemocytic survival, the trophozoite is likely
to express additional genes that are involved in nutrient
acquisition, proliferation, and pathogenesis.
Expressed sequence tag (EST) surveys [34] have proven
to be a viable approach for gene discovery and therapeutic target identification in a variety of microbial pathogens and parasites [35-38]. EST analysis offers a rapid and
valuable first glimpse of gene expression at a particular
life cycle stage or under certain environmental conditions. The number of gene sequences published or available in GenBank for the genus Perkinsus is very limited,
and mostly consist of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences.

In this study, we analyzed 31,727 ESTs generated from
trophozoites from two different P. marinus strains, one of
which was studied in both the presence and absence of
oyster serum. Grouping of the ESTs into clusters and singletons resulted in 7,863 unique sequences. Together,
they provide the first broad-based molecular view into
the basic biology and cellular metabolism of this protozoan parasite of unique phylogenetic position.

Methods
Parasite cultures

All P. marinus strains were maintained in DME: Ham's
F12 (1:2) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
as reported elsewhere [39]. Two cultured strains of P.
marinus trophozoites, CB5D4-ATCC PRA-240 (the
strain used for the sequencing the P. marinus genome;
[40]) grown in standard medium, and TXsc-ATCC 50983
[18] grown in both standard medium and medium supplemented with C. virginica serum (50%), were used for
RNA isolation and subsequent cDNA library and EST
generation.
RNA extraction and library construction

A total of four (non-normalized) libraries were constructed using P. marinus trophozoites. Three libraries
were constructed from strains propagated in standard
culture medium (TXsc and CB5D4), and one from the
TXsc strain propagated in medium supplemented with C.
virginica oyster serum (50%). Oyster serum was prepared
as reported earlier [41]. Briefly, shells were notched at the
posterior end and dorsal side of the shells, cleaned with
ethanol and hemolymph drawn from the adductor muscle (approximately 2 ml hemolymph per individual oyster) with a sterile syringe fitted with a 19-gauge needle.
Hemolymph samples were centrifuged at 800 × g at 4°C
for 10 min, the supernatant serum separated from the cell
pellet, mixed at equal parts with P. marinus culture
medium and used for the experimental cultures
described above.
Perkinsus marinus TXsc cultures were centrifuged for 5
min at 490 × g, and RNA extracted from the pellets (1.52.0 ml packed P. marinus trophozoites) by the guanidine
isothiocyanate method [42]. One mg of total RNA was
used for Poly A+ isolation and 5 μg of Poly A+ enriched P.
marinus RNA was used to construct each P. marinus
TXsc Lambda ZAP library following the manufacturer's
instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Each library was
amplified once through Escherichia coli XL1-Blue MRF
and stored at -80°C. Total RNA from the strain CB5D4
was extracted as above. A commercial service (Express
Genomics, Frederick, MD) was used to construct the
cDNA libraries. Since the libraries were not normalized
and to avoid redundancy of the ESTs, a large-insert
library (average insert size 2.4 kb) and a small-insert

Joseph et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:228
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/228

library (average insert size 1.4 kb) were constructed in
pExpress 1 (Not I-Eco RV cloned into T1 phage-resistant
DH10B E. coli).
DNA sequencing

P. marinus TXsc ESTs were obtained using two methods.
First, 308 individual recombinant phage were selected
randomly and cored out from the LB agar plates into
micro-centrifuge tubes containing 400 μl of TMG (Trismagnesium-gelatin) buffer and two drops (~50 μl) of
chloroform. cDNA inserts were amplified with T3 and T7
primers, resolved in a 1.5% agarose gel (w/v), recovered
using the QIAex II kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA), and used
for direct sequencing. Second, pBluescriptKS(-)
phagemid from the Lambda ZAP vectors was mass
excised from both libraries and individual colonies grown
for 24 h in a volume of 3 ml for plasmid preparations. In
both cases, single-pass sequencing of the 5' end of the
cDNA clone was carried out to generate the ESTs. P.
marinus CB5D4 ESTs were sequenced using the M13
primers.
Clustering and assembly of EST/mRNA sequences

EST sequences were pre-processed to determine the
sequence quality and to remove cloning vector sequences
from the reads using the Phred and Cross-match software
http://www.phrap.org. Poly-A/T tail trimming was done
using the 'EMBOSS' Trimmest program [43] before submission to GenBank (accessions #EH059339 - EH090757;
GR954914-GR955219; GR955352-GR955353). Sequence
assembly was performed by first clustering the ESTs into
groups of similar sequences, using TIGR's TGICL [44].
Subsequently, each cluster was separately assembled into
consensus sequences consisting of the longest nonredundant stretch of multiple aligned ESTs, using the
CAP4 algorithm (Parcel Inc.; http://www.paracel.com).
The sequences that did not cluster were treated as singletons. The cluster consensus and singleton sequences are
named Pm00001-Pm07863 and are available in Additional File 1.
Annotation of the P. marinus EST sequences

Consensus sequences of the EST assemblies and singletons were compared with the NCBI non-redundant (nr)
protein database (May 2009) using the BLASTX algorithm and the GenBank dbEST database (May 2009)
using the TBLASTX algorithm [45] with the default
parameters and with a cut-off E-value ≤ 1e-5. P. marinus
ESTs were removed from dbEST to avoid self hits during
screening. Determination of the taxonomic affinities of
hits was based upon an NCBI taxonomic trace-back of
best hits. For ease of presentation we have grouped the
red and green algae together with the plants, and the
brown algae with the Stramenopiles.

Page 3 of 21

The PLAN web system (Personal BLAST Navigator,
Noble Foundation) was used to assign functional annotation based on the top BLASTX hit and the gene ontology
(GO) sequence database [46]. To identify poorly conserved, or short fragments of genes contained in the
ESTs, six-frame translations of the sequences were generated. This resulted in 23,888 open reading frames (ORFs)
that are ≥ 75 amino acids. We searched the ORFs with
Pfam (Protein Families Database) (ver. 22.0) with an Evalue threshold of 0.1 to identify protein family domains.
Putative signal peptides were identified using SignalP 3.0
server http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/ and
SecretomeP 2.0 server http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/
SecretomeP/ using default parameters.
Analysis of orthology

We used the annotated proteins from 21 genomes [Additional file 2: Supplemental Table S1] from diverse organisms across the tree of life together with the P. marinus
proteome (ORF translations of ESTs) to identify
orthologs with the OrthoMCL algorithm [47]. The
OrthoMCL parameters used for the analysis were:
BLASTP E-value > 1e-25 and an inflation parameter of
1.5. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was performed
on ortholog groups that are shared by ≥ 4 taxa including
P. marinus. MSA was carried out using ClustalW [48]
enabling the 'TOSSGAPS' option and using the default
values for all other parameters. The regions that contained gaps or were highly divergent were removed from
the MSA by GBLOCKS [49] using its default settings.
Phylogenetic analysis was performed on the filtered multiple sequence alignments using Seqboot, Protdist,
Neighbor and Consense Tree (Phylip) [50], and the nearest neighbor of each P. marinus sequence was determined.
Searches for spliced leaders

The first 22 bp from the 5' end of each of the consensus
ESTs were extracted and analyzed with the de novo pattern-finding algorithm MEME to identify over-represented patterns. The width for patterns was set at 22 nt
and the zoops (zero or one per sequence) mode of occurrence was specified. Patterns that contained similarity or
partial similarity to previously identified spliced leader
(SL) sequences in dinoflagellates and Perkinsus marinus
were examined in further detail. ESTs that contain potential partial SL sequences at the 5' end were enumerated,
and the draft sequence of the P. marinus genome (GenBank Project ID: 12736) was searched using regular
expressions to find exact SL consensus sequences.
Genomic sequence (+/- 200 nt) flanking each of the putative SL loci was obtained, compared, and used to search
the P. marinus ESTs.

Results and Discussion
EST sequence analysis

Large-scale single-pass sequencing of cDNA clones randomly picked from libraries has proven to be a powerful
gene discovery approach and represents a "snapshot" of
gene expression in a given tissue and/or developmental
stage [51,52]. We took advantage of in vitro culture methods for P. marinus trophozoites to generate the first EST
data set for a member of the Perkinsozoa, a phylum that
includes parasites of mollusks and microeukaryotes [11].
Sequencing of the 5' end of cDNA clones from the two
strains of P. marinus trophozoites cultured in either standard or oyster serum-supplemented medium resulted in
4 EST libraries. The number of ESTs sequenced for each
library is shown in Table 1. Initial clustering using TGICL
software (JCVI) divided these sequences into 4,876 clusters. The clusters were then further assembled using
CAP4 to produce 5,181 final clusters and 2,682 singletons, yielding a total of 7,863 unique sequences (Pm0001
- Pm07863), or potential unigenes [Additional File 1]. The
average cluster length was 1,066 bp.
Comparison of ESTs obtained in the presence and absence
of oyster serum

Previously, we have shown that supplementation of the
Perkinsus culture medium with plasma from heavily
infected C. virginica oysters resulted in a 32% decrease in
proliferation of P. marinus; the inhibitory effect is less
pronounced with plasma from moderately infected and
uninfected oysters [41]. C. virginica plasma can also specifically inhibit protease activity, including from P. marinus. Analysis of the EST sequences from the serumsupplemented library revealed: aldolase, proteases, histone-specific proteins, serine/threonin-protein kinase,
deoxycytidylate deaminase and oxidoreductase enzymes,
and various transporters [Additional file 2: Supplemental

Table S2]. However, a comparison between the ESTs
obtained from the standard and oyster serum - supplemented culture (Table 1) is not possible. There are insufficient ESTs for conducting statistically-significant
comparisons under the different conditions due to the
very small sample size from the serum-supplemented
library. Combined sequences from both culture conditions were used for all subsequent analyses.
Similarity searches of the NCBI nr protein database
with the P. marinus 7,863 unique sequences revealed that
4,325, (55%) have significant similarity to proteins in the
database with E-value ≤ 1e-5. Figure 1 shows the cumulative distribution of nr BLASTX hits by taxonomic group.
The P. marinus sequences had the largest number of hits
to protein sequences of alveolates followed by hits to proteins of Metazoa/Fungi and Viridiplantae. The Viridiplantae hits may be significant with respect to the relict
plastid organelle and are discussed below. Interestingly,
there are also a number of hits to viruses. Subsequent the
description of P. marinus and most other Perkinsus spp.,
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies have
shown "virus-like particles" in both the nucleus and in the
cytoplasm [6,53,54]. Searches of the newly generated Perkinsus genome sequence for viral sequences reveals more
than 350 sequences annotated as putative retrovirus
polyproteins. Especially interesting is the EER13269
sequence, which encodes a 3,947 aa protein with putative
hits to viral related proteins including RNase H, integrases, retroposons, reverse transcriptase, transposase,
and arginine methyltransferase-interacting proteins.
TBLASTN analysis of the Perkinsus ESTs with EER13269
results in numerous significant hits to clusters: Pm01789,
Pm01239, Pm01095, Pm07693, Pm07559, Pm06487,
Pm00183, Pm04306, Pm01512, Pm02880 and Pm06668.

In addition, ESTs Pm00328, Pm01050, Pm04352,
Pm06163, Pm07375 and Pm07559 have hits to other
viruses including retroviruses. The genome annotation
together with EST data provide preliminary evidence for
the presence of a virus and/or retrotransposon elements
in the Perkinsus genome, a finding with potential implications for Perkinsus biology, tool development, and the
development of intervention strategies.
Figure 2 shows the distribution of the most significant
hits among the Chromalveolata, a supergroup that
encompasses alveolates (dinoflagellates, apicomplexans,
ciliates) and related protistan phyla (diatoms, others).
Within the chromoalveolates, protein sequences from
organisms in the phylum Apicomplexa had the highest
number of hits (1,213), although this result is biased by
the relative paucity of dinoflagellate sequences in nr relative to apicomplexan sequences [Additional file 2: Supplemental Table S3]. The Perkinsozoa (Perkinsus,
Parvilucifera, and Rastrimonas) are considered the earliest diverging sister group of the dinoflagellates [5,8,55].
Indeed, this phylogenetic position at the base of the dinoflagellate branch makes the Perkinsozoa a key taxon for
understanding unique adaptations (e.g. parasitism) within
the Alveolata [56]. The similarity of P. marinus sequences
to various members of these phyla provides important
insight into their relevance in alveolate-specific physiology, and helps prioritize them for functional characterization. Even though protein sequences from ciliates are
well represented in the nr database [136,531 from 2 ciliate
genome sequences as of May, 2009; Additional file 2: Supplemental Table S3], the relatively small number of best
hits to ciliates indicates the closer affinity of P. marinus to
dinoflagellates and apicomplexans than to the ciliates.

Alexandrium fundyense [58], Karenia brevis [59], Lingulodinium polyedrum [60,61], Amphidinium carterae [60],
and Symbiodinium sp. [52] have been completed.
TBLASTX comparisons of all P. marinus sequences to
the NCBI dbEST database were performed. Figure 1
shows the top hits of the Perkinsus sequences to ESTs
from various taxonomic groups. TBLASTX analysis of
7,863 sequences against dbEST resulted in 3,698 top hits
(47%), within which the Alveolata were the most wellrepresented. Among the chromalveolates, dinoflagellates
had the maximum number of top hits (690 hits; Figure 2),
an observation that supports the existing phylogenetic
placement of P. marinus closer to the dinoflagellates than
to the apicomplexans [12,13].
Molecular phylogenetic data have shown that P. marinus is a basal alveolate derived from ancestral dinoflagellates just after the split from apicomplexans [62]. Further
evidence indicating a relationship of P. marinus to the
dinoflagellates was revealed with the discovery of SL
trans-splicing in P. marinus and P. chesapeaki cDNAs
[63], an mRNA processing phenomenon found in several
dinoflagellate species [64]. Trans-splicing in P. marinus
has been reported, but the SL sequence bears a single
nucleotide change with respect to the canonical sequence
in dinoflagellates [64]. A considerable number (14.7%), of
the P. marinus ESTs contain partial SL sequences identical to the reported single-nucleotide non-canonical SL
sequence. The longest SL identified was 13 nts and was
present in 40 different sequences. Partial SL sequences of
≥ 5 nt were observed in 1,156 consensus sequences.
Incomplete SL sequences in cDNA are common [65] and
believed to be the result of inhibitors, often 5' message
modifications, that interfere with reverse transcription.
We have identified a putative full-length 22 nt SL in three
P. marinus Nramp divalent cation transporters (Lin, Z.,
Fernández-Robledo, J.A., Cellier, M.F.M. Vasta, G.R.,
unpublished results). Numerous 22 nt SL sequences are
encoded in the P. marinus genome (Joseph, S.J., and
Kissinger, J.C., unpublished data), and although no fulllength spliced-leader sequences were observed in the
ESTs presented here, putative ESTs corresponding to
portions of genomic SL loci were identified.

represented parasite-specific 'developmental' sub-categories. Approximately 7% of the terms were for regulation
of protein biosynthesis, transcription, cell proliferation,
apoptosis, DNA replication, and glycolysis. Significant
representation of proteins involved in translation has also
been reported in EST sequencing projects for Toxoplasma tachyzoites [35,66], Cryptosporidium sporozoites
[67] and Eimeria merozoites [68]. Abundant messages for
ribosomal proteins are suggestive of the rapid and extensive protein translation that accompanies parasite differentiation and multiplication following host-cell invasion.
Catalytic activity (39%) was the most dominant molecular
function (Figure 3(b)). Multiple proteases, including
cathepsins B, E, H, L, and S, and serine-type peptidase,
were identified. The expression of multiple proteases in P.
marinus may indicate their role(s) in processing the host
protein substrates to facilitate uptake of their metabolic
products to sustain normal cell function and proliferation. The expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was
consistent with prior reports. P. marinus uses SODs to
protect itself from reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs)
generated by the host's oxidative enzymes [69-74].
Sequences identified as 'binding' components comprised
about 36% of the total, followed by 'transporter' at 8%, the
majority being ion transporters and transporters with
carrier activity. Some of the 'transporter' consensus
sequences fell into the 'ATPase coupled transporter' subcategory, which includes transporters of sugars, peptides,
amino acids, and other small molecules. Around 2% were
designated as transcriptional regulators, with the majority designated as having transcription factor activity.
Over two-thirds of the consensus sequences were localized by cellular component to either cell or organelle, as
shown in Figure 3(c). Of this, the majority was assigned to
the nucleus, mitochondrion, endoplasmic reticulum,
nucleolus, and a few were assigned to chloroplast thylakoid. Other sequences (4.7%) were categorized as 'membrane enclosed lumen', and included mitochondrial,
nucleolar, and cytosolic membranes.
Functional analysis of protein sequences

We analyzed conserved protein domains using Pfam as a
database to predict the function of ORFs generated from
P. marinus consensus sequences. Overall, 2,704 ORFs
encode protein domains similar to 1,042 Pfam protein
families (E-value < 0.1). Among these Pfam families, 65
families were denoted as DUFs (Domain of Unknown
Function). We found that 2,009 ORFs contain a single
PFAM protein domain while 492 have two domains, 96
have three, 58 have four, 28 have five and 28 ORFs contain six or more domains. The most abundant Pfam
domains in P. marinus are presented in Table 2; protein
domains that are of evolutionary and therapeutic interest
in this parasite are shown in Table 3.

Orthologous groups

To determine the number of potential orthologs between
P. marinus and proteins from 21 organisms representative of the major divisions of the tree of life, [Additional
file 2: Supplemental Table S1] we performed a clustering
analysis on the non-redundant 21 genome protein sets
along with the P. marinus EST ORF proteome using the
OrthoMCL program [47]. In brief, OrthoMCL defines
clusters based on reciprocal best BLASTP hits and sorts
proteins without a reciprocal best BLASTP hit into the
best matching cluster. The input dataset for OrthoMCL
consisted of 325,188 protein sequences from 22 proteomes. P. marinus sequences (5,661 ORFs) were found in
2,878 ortholog groups, of which 1,715 are unique to P.
marinus i.e., no sequences from other taxa are present in
this group. The extent to which P. marinus shares orthologous genes with the 21 other taxa examined is listed in
Additional file 2: Supplemental Table S4. As the number
of taxa increases, the number of shared genes decreases.
Phylogenetic analysis

Automated phylogenetic analyses of the orthologous
clusters was performed to determine the nearest taxonomic neighbor for each sequence. This approach is useful for establishing gene origins, identifying genes with
restricted phylogenetic distribution and to identify putative horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events in the P. marinus genome. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from
the 1,042, ortholog groups that shared ≥ 4 taxa including
P. marinus [Additional file 2: Supplemental Table S4].
Multiple alignments were created with ClustalW and filtered using GBLOCKS to remove ambiguous regions.
Only ortholog groups with ≥ 50 aligned aa were used for
phylogenetic analysis, and 291 alignments met this criterion. Neighbor-joining trees were constructed with bootstrap support to determine the P. marinus nearest
neighbor. Not surprisingly, 54% of the orthologous
groups have alveolates as the closest neighbor to P. marinus (48% apicomplexans and 6% ciliates (dinoflagellates
are not represented)). Toxoplasma gondii was the most
highly represented species. P. marinus sequences also
show nearest neighbors of kinetoplastids, bacteria,
archaea and red algae. For the gene encoding 2-C-methylD-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidyly transferase (IspD), one
of the seven enzymes involved in plastid metabolism
recently discovered in P. marinus [75-77] its nearest
neighbor is that from the red algae Cyanidioschyzon
merolae. Other important taxonomic groups that were
found to be closest neighbors to P. marinus include the
Heterokontophyta [Thalassiosira pseudonana (17 genes),
and Phytopthora ramorum (36 genes)], Plantae [Arabidopsis thaliana (26 genes)], Animalia [Homo sapiens (24
genes), Drosophila melanogaster (7 genes)], and Fungi
[Saccharomyces cerevisiae (11 genes)]. It should be noted

Sequences of particular interest
Proteases

The presence of protease sequences in P. marinus
deserves special mention. Proteases from Perkinsus are
involved in pathogenesis and host-parasite interactions;
indeed, oyster homogenate enhances the infectivity of the
parasite and reflects changes in the Perkinsus extracellular product (ECP) composition [78]. In vitro protease
expression and cellular differentiation also appear to be
modulated by oyster tissue extracts; fewer proteases can
be observed in Crassostrea ariakensis supplemented
medium compared to C. virginica supplemented medium
[79]. There is also evidence that oyster plasma protease
inhibitor contributes to some oyster species' resistance to
Perkinsus [80-82]. Although several proteases have
already been reported in P. marinus [21,83] our EST analysis identified numerous P. marinus sequences with Pfam
domains (Table 3) and strong BLAST similarity (Table 4)
to cathepsin-like cysteine protease, subtilisin-like serine

protease, rhomboid-like protease 1, cysteine protease,
ATP-dependent protease, serine protease, metacaspase 1
precursor, and ubiquitin-specific proteases. As observed
for other well-characterized parasites, some proteases
produced by P. marinus might degrade host protein substrates to acquire the nutrients necessary for normal cell
function and proliferation. Interestingly, several of the
ESTs encoded proteases with possible signal/secretion
peptides, including subtilisin-like serine protease (score
0.882), cathepsin-like cysteine protease (score 0.861), calcium-dependent cysteine protease (score 0.782) and
metacaspase 1 precursor (score 0.923). Congruent with
the hypothesis that the oyster host has adaptations to
contend with parasite peptidases, C. virginica plasma
contains a serine protease inhibitor that binds tightly to
subtilisin and perkinsin was purified from the plasma of
C. virginica suggesting a role in host defense against the
parasite's proteolytic activity [84].
Antioxidant enzymes

Upon phagocytosis by oyster hemocytes, Perkinsus marinus trophozites localize inside phagosome-like structures
where they remain viable and undergo proliferation.

Available evidence indicates that the parasite survives
oxidative stress imposed by the oyster defense mechanisms [30,31]. Protistan parasites generally contain antioxidant activities, but may lack other enzymes typical of
animal antioxidant pathways. During recent years we
identified and characterized in P. marinus trophozites
iron SOD and ascorbate-dependent peroxidase (APX)
that degrade the ROIs resulting from the oxidative burst
associated with phagocytosis [73,74]. Specifically, P.
marinus SOD1 (PmSOD1) encodes a mitochondrial FeSOD [69-74], which may contribute to P. marinus resistance to exogenous oxidative damage in host phagocytes
[73]. In contrast, although the product of PmSOD2 is predicted to be targeted to a putative plastid, confocal and
immunogold studies localized it to the cell periphery and
cytoplasmic single membrane compartments [85], raising
interesting questions regarding its organellar targeting
and the nature of a putative relict plastid described in
other Perkinsus species. SOD catalyzes the dismutation
of O2- to H2O2, which may be eliminated by either catalase or peroxidases such as glutathione-dependent peroxidase (GPX). GPX requires reduced glutathione produced
by glutathione reductase. Analysis of P. marinus ESTs
identified sequences for several P. marinus oxidative
pathway components that are expressed in the trophozoite stage. These include peroxiredoxin 6, peroxiredoxin V,
thioredoxins, glutaredoxins, glutathione reductase, and
thioredoxin reductase (Table 5). Sequences highly similar
to PmSOD1 and PmSOD2 were identified (Table 5) as
well as several confirmatory Pfam domains (Table 3).
Because no catalase activity has been detected in P. marinus, and no catalase gene has been identified in its
genome, it is likely that some of the abovementioned peroxidases are involved in H2O2 detoxification.

Fatty acid synthesis

Lipid analysis of 7 day-old in vitro cultured P. marinus
trophozoites indicated that triacylglycerol represents
48.7% of the total lipids [86]. P. marinus trophozoites utilize 13C-acetate to synthesize a range of saturated and
unsaturated fatty acids and the parasite's ability to synthesize 20:4(n-6) de novo is unique within parasitic protozoa
[87]. Eukaryotes employ either the delta-6 or delta-8
desaturase pathway, or both, to synthesize arachidonic
acid, an essential fatty acid. The meront stage of P. marinus synthesizes arachidonic acid through the delta-8
pathway [88]. In addition, it has been suggested that P.
marinus cannot synthesize sterols and must sequester
them from its host. Perkinsus cells are able to proliferate
in complete lipid supplement medium (cod liver oil, cholesterol and alpha tocopherol acetate in detergent) and
media containing cholesterol or cholesterol+alpha
tocopherol acetate, but fail to proliferate in control
medium and medium containing just alpha tocopherol
acetate [89]. However, the genome of P. marinus encodes
6 out of 7 methylerythrithol phosphate (MEP) pathway
genes [75-77] indicating that Perkinsus is able to synthesize de novo sterols (see below: isoprenoid metabolism).
ESTs matching enzymes involved in sterol metabolism
also include sterol glucosyltransferases (Pm04113, E = 1e47; Pm01717, E = 4e-42; Pm04859, E = 6e-44), sterol C-24
reductase (Pm01729, E = 3e-50), and sterol desaturase
(Pm00771, E = 9e-23). Three P. marinus genes encoding
the enzymes responsible for arachidonic acid biosynthesis (C18 delta-9-elongating activity, C20 delta-8 desaturase, C20 delta-5 desaturase) are clustered and cotranscribed as an operon [27]. Sequences highly similar
to delta-9 desaturase (Pm03609, E-value = 1e-66), delta-8
fatty acid desaturase (Pm07340, E-value = 1e-161), and

Joseph et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:228
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/228

delta-5 desaturase (Pm03710, E-value = 0.00) were present, while no sequences similar to delta-6 fatty acid desaturase were identified, in agreement with the
abovementioned observations. Pfam analysis identified 8
fatty acid desaturase domains including the above
sequences (Table 3).
Sequences similar to the plastid-localized enzyme,
acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Pm00609 (E-value = 2e-41) and
Pm05907 (E-value = 3e-16)) involved in fatty acid biosynthesis were also identified in this study. Indeed, it has
been shown that Perkinsus proliferation is inhibited by
Triclosan and cerulenin, which has been interpreted as
evidence for the presence of a plastidic FAS II pathway
[24,25]. However, when considering the effect of Triclosan as indicative of the relevance of the apicoplast FASII
biosynthesis, results should be interpreted with caution,
since in Plasmodium, the antimalarial activity of Triclosan is not targeted to FabI [90]. Further, although Theileria is also susceptible to this drug, genes coding for FASII
are lacking in the Theileria genome [91].
Heat shock proteins

Expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in P. marinus suggests that the parasite might use general stress
response genes to overcome the stress imposed by the
host environment. In Toxoplasma, the HSP70 gene is
expressed during the transition from the active to latent
form [92]. In virulent Toxoplasma strains, HSP70 contains seven amino acids not present in the HSP70 from
non-virulent strains, and HSP70 expression is elevated 2fold in virulent versus non-virulent strains [93]. A highly
similar consensus sequence to the T. gondii HSP70 protein (Pm00065, Evalue = 0.00) was identified in the P.
marinus EST analysis. Further, two sequences similar to
HSP90 were identified, Pm00171 (E-value = 1e-176) and
Pm05367 (E-value = 3e-60). Many heat shock proteins are
chaperonins, which function in concert with proteins
similar to the delta subunit of the t-complex family of
chaperonins, and are found in virtually all organisms
including Leishmania [94]. In different species, t-complex
chaperonins are involved in protein folding after stressrelated denaturation. Two chaperonin homologs,
encoded by Pm03177 and Pm01657, are similar to proteins with roles in thermo-tolerance, cell-cycle progression and hematopoeisis. Pfam analysis detected the same
HSP90 and HSP70 proteins as well as and Cpn_TCP1
(HSP60 chaperonin family-TCP-1 family) domains (Table
3).
Isoprenoid metabolism

Although TEM observations have failed to identify a
plastid in Perkinsus species [6,95], recent studies suggest
that genes associated with secondary plastids may be
present. P. marinus possesses genes for a plant-type ferredoxin system that possibly encodes plastid-targeting signals [25]. Recently, TEM observations in Perkinsus olseni

Page 12 of 21

revealed a very large (about 375-800 nm in diameter/
larger axis) organelle with four membranes [26], although
concerns have been raised about the nature of the structures observed [85]. Ferredoxin and ferredoxin-NADP
reductase, proteins predicted to target the putative relict
plastid [25], were identified in our analysis (Table 6). The
search for P. marinus methylerythrithol phosphate (MEP)
pathway genes, responsible for de novo isoprenoid synthesis in plastids, has resulted in the full-length
sequences for 6 out of 7 of these genes [75-77]. These
provide evidence for a complete MEP pathway in P. marinus, and are indicative of a plastid organelle [76]. Four
enzymes of the MEP pathway were identified in the present EST study. 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase
(DXP synthase) is responsible for conversion of pyruvate
and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate into DXP (Table 6).
Another enzyme that functions as an intermediate step in
the MEP pathway called MEP cytidylyltransferase (IspD)
was also detected in this EST analysis (Pm05015, E-value
= 4e-26) as was 2C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (ME-CPP synthase) and 4-hydroxy-2methyl-2-butenyl 4-diphosphate synthase (HMBPP synthase). An IspD Pfam domain was identified in one of the
above P. marinus EST ORFs (Table 3).
Glycan assembly and carbohydrate-binding proteins

Oligosaccharides on cell surface and intracellular glycoconjugates are assembled by the combined activity of glycosyltransferases and glycosidases, and may interact with
carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins). Further, proteincarbohydrate recognition plays a key role in intracellular
processes such as protein folding and transport, as well as
interactions between cells or cells and the extracellular
matrix in functions related to development, immune
responses, and host-parasite interactions. It is widely
accepted that recognition of parasitic surface glycoconjugates by host humoral or cell-associated lectins are frequently involved in cellular recognition and colonization
of the host. Several studies have partially characterized
multiple lectins in the oyster plasma and hemocytes,
which recognize glycoproteins that display terminal
galactose and N-acetylated sugars [96,97]. Flow cytometry analysis of P. marinus trophozoites labeled with commercial lectins [98] enabled a tentative identification of
some of the sugars present on the surface of the P. marinus trophozoites. Recently, we demonstrated that an oyster galectin present on the hemocyte surface functions as
a parasite receptor and facilitates host entry [28]. Once
inside the host, trophozoites survive intra-hemocytic killing mechanisms and proliferate [32]. The P. marinus ESTs
include several with high similarity to glycosyltransferases and other members of the 'sugar moiety' transferase enzyme family. Four sequences (Pm01326 (E-value
= 2e-49), Pm02039 (E-value = 9e-31), Pm07403 (E-value
= 1e-08), Pm02460, E-value = 3e-09) show high similarity

(Pm04859, E-value = 6e-44), prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase (Pm04168, E-value = 2e-23) and alpha
glucosidase (Pm03682 (E-value = 2e-44), Pm01066 (Evalue = 2e-50) were also observed. In addition, Pfam
domains
for
the
glycosyltransferase
family,
Glyco_transf_20 (trehalose-6-phosphate transferase),
Glyco_transf_22 (Alg9-like mannosyl transferase),
Glyco_transf_28 (UDP-N-acetyl glucosaminine transferase and Glyco_transf_8 (lipopolysaccaride galactosyl
transferase) were observed (Table 3). A single EST ORF
encoding the domain called Alg14 (oligosaccharide biosynthesis protein Alg14 like), which represents an important protein in the synthesis of glycoconjugates, was also
identified (Table 3). Prior studies have revealed glycosidase activity, including β-D-glucosidase, β-D-xylosidase,
N-acetyl β-D-glucosaminidase and N-acetyl β-D-galactosaminidase in Perkinsus trophozoites, and N-acetyl βD-glucosaminidase in spent culture medium (Ahmed, H.,
Fernández-Robledo, J.A., Vasta, G.R., unpublished
results).
Three unique EST clusters (Pm03024 (E-value = 1e-36),
Pm03327 (E-value = 1e-30) and Pm02250 (E-value = 7e26)) show similarity to the ERGIC-53-like mannose binding lectin also present in Cryptosporidium, Toxoplasma
and Plasmodium species. ERGIC-53 is a type 1 transmembrane L-type lectin present in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) that captures correctly folded glycoproteins, and mediates their transport along the secretory
pathway. The yeast L-lectins Emp46p and EMP47p,
homologues of ERGIC-53, have been proposed to be
transport receptors that facilitate recruitment of glycoproteins into vesicles budding from the ER [99]. One
unique sequence (Pm04230, E-value = 7e-12) shows similarity to the mannose-binding lectin derived from Crinum asiaticum, a plant lectin with homologies to known

monocot mannose-binding lectins from Amaryllidaceae,
Orchidaceae, Alliaceae and Liliaceae, high similarity to
the gastrodianin-type antifungal proteins and a predicted
structure similar to that of the Galanthus nivalis agglutinin [100]. The sequence Pm07056 shows similarity to a
galactose-specific lectin. Pfam analysis also detected similarities with plant lectins, such as domains for the ricintype beta-trefoil lectin and legume-like-lectin (Table 3).
Nucleotide metabolism

Several nucleotide salvage enzymes were identified.
Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase,
HGPRT (Pm04986, E-value = 2e-57), and hypoxanthinexanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase, HXGPRT
(Pm07697, E-value = 6e-53); uridine kinase - uracil phosphoribosyltransferase, UK-UPRT (Pm01230, E-value =
1e-40) and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase, UPRT
(Pm07824, E-value = 2e-43) were detected. Pfam analysis
revealed the presence of phosphoribosyl transferase in 3
ESTs including Pm04986 (Table 3). Evidence for a few de
novo biosynthetic enzymes was detected. There is a hit to
dihydroorotate oxidase (Pm05343, E-value = 7e-30), uridylate kinase (Pm05827, E-value = 3e-19) and adenylosuccinate synthetase (Pm02370, E-value = 1e-128) all
involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis. Pfam analysis also
revealed an adenylosuccinate synthetase domain in
Pm02370.
Potential targets for chemotherapy

Several potential candidates for chemotherapy in P. marinus were identified in this EST study. Like the proteases
from other parasites, known to degrade host proteins for
acquisition of the nutrients, proteases produced by P.
marinus could be targeted for chemotherapy. Further, the
plasma of the eastern oyster C. virginica contains a serine
protease inhibitor that binds tightly to subtilisin and perkinsin, and is potentially involved in blocking the parasite's proteolytic activity [84]. Therefore, dermo diseaseresistant oyster populations could be established by introducing through selective breeding selected gene variants
that exhibit enhanced expression of protease inhibitors.
Further, based on the observed in vitro susceptibility of

the parasite to selected ROIs [73] and hemocyte-based
defense against the parasite in vivo [101], therapeutic
agents could be applied to infected oysters to enhance
their respiratory burst in response to P. marinus. Similarly, and based on the observation that parasites are usually more susceptible to ROIs than are their hosts,
components of the P. marinus anti-oxidative stress pathway could be the basis for development of therapeutic
drugs. Conventional molecular modeling approaches
such as the Drug Design by Receptor Fit (DDRF) methods can be applied to the parasite enzymes such as glutathione reductase, peroxiredoxin, thioredoxin, and
glutaredoxins, whose sequences were identified in this
study. The P. marinus EST analysis also identified
sequences similar to aldolase, an enzyme that has been

used as a target for therapy in several Plasmodium species because of its central role in energy metabolism (glycolysis) [102]. Aldolases have been also used for
intervention in Trypanosoma brucei infection [103].
Therefore, the potential for aldolase inhibitors, already in
use for other parasites, to inhibit P. marinus growth in
vitro warrants further investigation. The recent characterization of the isoprenoid pathway in P. marinus
strongly suggests the presence of a cryptic plastid in the
parasite, which has been identified as an excellent target
for drug therapy in apicomplexan parasites [104-107].
Analytical methods [77] as well as EST evidence from the
current study point towards the presence of a DOXP/ME
pathway (Table 5) to produce isopentenyl diphosphate.

Plasmodium falciparum has been fully characterized
[108] and fosmidomycin, a specific inhibitor of the DOXP
reductoisomerase, is very effective against malaria [109].
Interestingly, fosmidomycin has also been tested against
Perkinsus trophozoites and it appears that up to 5 days
concentrations up to 1 mM show no effect on growth
inhibition [25]. The genes for the DOXP pathway are
present in Toxoplasma and it has been proposed [110]

that toxoplasmosis could be treated by targeting a downstream pathway enzyme, farnesyl diphosphate synthase
(FPPS), using bisphosphonates, which are specific FPPS
inhibitors. A similar strategy could also be applied to
dermo disease if bisphosphonates do not affect the oyster
or if fosmidomycin does not show differential effectiveness against the parasite DOXP pathway. Therapeutic
strategies using existing drugs such as bisphosphonates

Figure 4 Biological role(s) of P. marinus sequences of particular interest. Several aspects of Perkinsus biology are highlighted, including the identification of pathways indicative of a relict/cryptic plastid, expression of numerous transporters and proteases likely be involved in the uptake of nutrients and the degradation of host components, enzymes and lectins involved in glycan assembly, protein folding and secretion, and parasite-host
interactions.

and fosmidomycin have the advantage of avoiding costs
of de novo drug design and development. Moreover, virtual screening initiatives could provide new avenues for
drug development against numerous protozoan parasites
[111]. Conversely, these observations also highlight the
potential for using P. marinus as a readily-cultured, nonpathogenic model for early screening of potential drugs
against a variety of protistan human parasites.

Conclusions
By providing a first glimpse into expression of genes
encoding proteins associated with important metabolic
pathways in other parasitic protozoa, such as proteases,
oxidative stress enzymes, fatty-acid synthesis and isoprenoid metabolism, the sequences generated from the P.
marinus cDNA libraries are extremely informative. The
identification of proteins implicated in glycan assembly,
protein folding and secretion, and parasite-host interactions, and those that participate in biochemical pathways

associated with a putative relict plastid, suggest that
potential chemotherapy targets that have been proven to
be effective in other protozoan parasites are also
expressed in P. marinus and could lead to novel intervention strategies for dermo disease (Figure 4).
P. marinus sequences display the greatest similarity to
EST sequences from dinoflagellates. No significant differences were observed between EST populations obtained
from parasites propagated under standard conditions and
those exposed to oyster serum. This finding is a consequence of the small number of ESTs sampled, and a more
rigorous analysis should be carried out by expanding both
sample size and incorporating additional experimental
strategies. Concerning the latter, to gain a better understanding P. marinus virulence, approaches such as subtractive techniques [112,113] and microarray analysis will
be very useful. Although our results are a first step in that
direction, the application of subtractive techniques
should result in ESTs overlooked in our study due to the

Joseph et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:228
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/228

limitations of non-normalized libraries. The libraries and
ESTs generated here, however, may find further use in the
production of microarrays to visualize changes in gene
expression, such as expression of parasite genes related to
defense against the oyster's immune system.
As indicated above, P. marinus expresses sequences
with significant similarity of dinoflagellates followed by
the apicomplexans. Although the fraction of P. marinus
transcripts that are trans-spliced is still unknown, the
identification of a SL in >14% of the ESTs confirms the
previously established affinity with dinoflagellates. It also
suggests that PCR amplification based on the Perkinsus
variant of the SL would provide a rapid and efficient
method of amplifying and cloning full-length transcripts
in the future.
The EST analysis reported herein, together with the
recently completed P. marinus genome sequencing project (GenBank Project ID: 12736), and the development of
a transfection system for Perkinsus trophozoites [40] will
enhance the community's ability to improve the status of
both natural and farmed oyster stocks by identifying gene
products suitable for drug targeting, which will lead to
therapeutic applications that may be effective in closed
(especially hatchery) systems. The genes relevant to hostparasite interactions, particularly those involved in hostcell entry and/or pathway signaling may lead to genetically-selected or -engineered oysters that either block the
entry of the parasite or enhance the response of the oyster defense against P. marinus. Production of seed oysters
that remain disease-free and reach marketable size will be
critical for full recovery of wild eastern oyster populations, which provide irreplaceable environmental services. Disease-resistant oysters would also form the basis
of a viable shellfishery, as well as sustainable production
of farmed oysters.
