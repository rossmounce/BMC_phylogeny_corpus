Abstract
Background: The modern wildherd of the tundra muskox (Ovibos moschatus) is native only to the
New World (northern North America and Greenland), and its genetic diversity is notably low.
However, like several other megafaunal mammals, muskoxen enjoyed a holarctic distribution
during the late Pleistocene. To investigate whether collapse in range and loss of diversity might be
correlated, we collected mitochondrial sequence data (hypervariable region and cytochrome b)
from muskox fossil material recovered from localities in northeastern Asia and the Arctic
Archipelago of northern North America, dating from late Pleistocene to late Holocene, and
compared our results to existing databases for modern muskoxen.
Results: Two classes of haplotypes were detected in the fossil material. "Surviving haplotypes"
(SHs), closely similar or identical to haplotypes found in modern muskoxen and ranging in age from
~22,000 to ~160 yrbp, were found in all New World samples as well as some samples from
northeastern Asia. "Extinct haplotypes" (EHs), dating between ~44,000 and ~18,000 yrbp, were
found only in material from the Taimyr Peninsula and New Siberian Islands in northeastern Asia.
EHs were not found in the Holocene muskoxen specimens available for this study, nor have they
been found in other studies of extant muskox populations.
Conclusion: We provisionally interpret this evidence as showing that genetic variability was
reduced in muskoxen after the Last Glacial Maximum but before the mid-Holocene, or roughly
within the interval 18,000-4,000 yrbp. Narrowing this gap further will require the recovery of more
fossils and additional genetic information from this interval.

Background
The large-mammal (megafaunal) diversity of North America and Eurasia was considerably reduced by extinctions
that occurred around the time of the Pleistocene/
Holocene transition (i.e., ca. 10,000 years ago) [1]. Inter-

estingly, some megafaunal species (e.g., woolly mammoth, Mammuthus primigenius) became extinct at this time
in North American and Eurasian continental areas but
survived on nearby islands for thousands of years thereafter [2,3]. Some other species whose ranges likewise

the late Pleistocene, Ovibos ranged from western Europe to
North America via Beringia. In the Old World, presence of
muskox fossils on islands north of mainland Asia presumably
indicates that Ovibos was able to extend its range during full
glacial times to the subaerial parts of the continental shelf
(dashed line). In the New World, in addition to central
Alaska, unglaciated areas in the western Arctic Archipelago
may have continuously supported muskoxen also, although
the finite 14C fossil record for these islands does not begin
until about 6800 yrbp [40].

straddled the Old and New Worlds became extinct on one
continent, but not the other, at the end of the Pleistocene
(e.g., horse, Equus caballus; saiga, Saiga tatarica). A third
pattern, involving a much lengthier decline, characterizes
Ovibos moschatus (tundra muskox), the subject of this
paper (fig. 1, 2).
According to the available fossil record, the lineage terminally represented by O. moschatus arose in Eurasia but
entered North America at least as early as the early Pleistocene [4-6]. At roughly the same time several other
closely-related Asian ovibovine lineages (e.g., Soergelia,
Praeovibos) also entered North America, where they evidently prospered before disappearing later in the Pleistocene. By the start of the Holocene, muskox diversity had

yr), collated from the literature [32,40,41]. In addition to a
notable difference in dating intensity, with many more published 14C dates being available for New World Ovibos, there
is also a considerable difference in sample statistics. Skewed
date distribution for New World Ovibos reflects long-term
effect of former icecaps on amount of habitable area [42]. In
northeastern Asia, where only small, local (cordilleran) icecaps formed, potential range was less affected and Ovibos was
presumably continuously present during the last 40–50,000
years. Star in B denotes 7,000 yr gap between "last" Pleistocene and "first" Holocene dated occurrences of Ovibos in
Asia. Slight offset in "period of heightened extinction" in New
World vs. Old World, amounting to approximately 500–

been reduced to surviving O. moschatus; the species is now
native only to the islands of the Arctic Archipelago and
Greenland (fig. 1), if late 20th-century efforts to reintroduce muskoxen into various parts of their ancient range
are ignored [6].
This lengthy history of muskox diversification in Quaternary Holarctica stands in sharp contrast to the extremely
limited genetic diversity characterizing modern O. moschatus. Groves' [7,8] analysis of sequence data for cytochrome b (cyt b) and the mitochondrial hypervariable
region in 37 individuals of O. moschatus from various
localities in Alaska, Canada, and Greenland revealed only

marginal genetic differentiation within extant populations. Groves [7] identified a total of 8 hypervariable
region haplotypes, but these differed individually by only
1 or 2 nucleotide substitutions in approximately twothirds of the cases, for a maximum of 9 differences – a
total of 1.3% variation across 697 bp (base pairs), including insertions and deletions. Extreme genetic homogeneity is also indicated by microsatellite analysis [[9], but see
also [10]] and the nuclear Mhc DRB3 gene [11]. As several
different populations were sampled for these studies, in
the absence of any other plausible explanation it seems
reasonable to conclude that living muskoxen simply lack
genetic diversity. The nuclear and mitochondrial data
therefore complement each other and imply that
muskoxen either passed through a long period of very
small effective population sizes, or experienced one or
more genetic bottlenecks in very recent times. The investigation reported here was prompted by the possibility that
ancient DNA (aDNA) analyses might shed some light on
the complex history of extirpation, replacement, and differential survival that have evidently affected muskoxen
populations during the late Quaternary. Ancient DNA
analysis has been successfully applied to late Pleistocene
and Holocene (including the early 20th century) remains
by various groups [e.g., [12-22]]. Because of existing
uncertainty concerning species boundaries among some
late Quaternary members of tribe Ovibovini, the terms
"ovibovine" and "muskox" will be used to make general
reference to such taxa, without endorsing any particular
view as to their taxonomic distinctiveness or geographical
distribution.

Results
Our results permit empirical recognition of two haplotype
groupings within late Quaternary muskoxen. The first
consists of haplotypes recovered from Pleistocene samples collected at various localities in northeastern Asia,
including islands north of the mainland (fig. 1, 3). These
haplotypes, which differ from all New World material so
far examined as well as from the few known Asian specimens that are of Holocene age, appear to have completely
disappeared and may therefore be grouped as "EHs"
(extinct haplotypes). All other known haplotypes, which
include those found in all living muskoxen, are very similar inter se and thus comprise a second grouping, "SHs"
(surviving haplotypes).

some Old World samples. EHs have been found so far only
in Asian samples.

Sequence verification
A total of 9 fossil samples yielded reproducible sequence
covering cyt b and the hypervariable region of the mtDNA
genome; with the exception of OMTai14, each fragment
from these samples was successfully amplified at least
twice (additional fig. 1, 2, 3; table 1). One other sample
(OMBolL15564) yielded consistent results for cyt b but
the HV sequence could not be accurately scored (table 1,

additional fig. 4). Sequences were then determined via
multiple clones produced from each PCR product, a
standard aDNA protocol for insuring correct sequence
determination [12,22] (additional fig. 1, 2, 3). In
addition, several samples were independently extracted by
different individuals, amplified, and cloned. Clones were
sequenced in one or another of the three separate laboratories involved in this investigation (AMNH, New York;
Medigenomix
GmbH,
Munich;
SR&D
GmbH,
Martinsried).
For example, to determine the cyt b sequence for sample
OMTai38, two PCRs were performed for the first fragment
and second overlapping fragment and five clones
sequenced for each PCR product (additional fig. 2). The
sequences summarized in tables 3, 4, 5 are thus the consensus of independent replications and multiple-clone
sequences for each individual PCR fragment (with a few

exceptions), and are unlikely to be laboratory artifacts
(additional fig. 1, 2, 3). For this particular sample, all
clones from the 3' fragments were identical with one
exception: in clone 1.2, there is a C-T transition which
most likely represents a polymerase error. In the 5' fragment, all five clones of the first PCR were identical. In the
second fragment three classes of sequence were obtained,
represented by clones 2.3 and 2.4; these were identical to
the clones from the first PCR and matched the 3' fragment
in the overlap. The second and third class of sequences
(2.1, 2.2, and 2.5) were different from all other clones
obtained in the study, unique to the second PCR amplification, and did not match the 3' fragment in the overlap.
Blast searching the sequence revealed perfect or near perfect homology for both divergent sequences with other
bovid species such as the domestic sheep, Ovis aries. These
likely represent nuclear mitochondrial DNA sequences
(Numts) and thus the sequence represented in the two

independent fragments was scored as the bona fide
mtDNA sequence, the consensus of which was used for
further study.
This example represents a relatively extreme case, as most
PCRs yielded identical or nearly identical sequences that
differed by minor among-clone variations that can be
explained by DNA polymerase/sequencing errors or DNA
damage in the templates (for example, note the clone
sequences for OMTai39 in additional fig. 2). Where a
position or several positions were not determinable after
two independent amplifications, additional PCRs were
performed, clones sequenced, and the majority base
scored as the bona fide mtDNA sequence for each position of each sequence. In other words, each base of each
sequence was covered by multiple PCRs and multiple
clone sequences to determine the majority base for a given
position as in Krings et al. [12].

In addition, six other samples (OMTai95, OMWra2,
OMTai31670, OMYuk02, OMArA09, and OMYak12)
yielded some sequence information, but the amount of
DNA recovered was insufficient to permit two
independent replications for each fragment and/or
retrieve all four fragments of interest in this study (see
table 1).
Overlapping PCR reactions were used to identify possible
Numts and to prevent mischaracterizing Numts as
organellar mtDNA [14,23]. In some species DNA
extracted from hair may yield Numts at a higher frequency
than do other tissues [24], making it a useful proxy for
gauging the possibility of Numt contamination. A hair
sample (OMModCl, table 1) from a living muskox was
amplified, products cloned, and multiple sequences determined using several of the primer combinations used in
this study. Sequences were consistent in the overlapping

regions and matched DNA from other modern muskoxen,
indicating that the primers used in this study do not favor
Numts over organellar mtDNA (additional fig. 1, 2).
Cytochrome b
A 114-bp segment of cyt b was successfully retrieved from
most of the working fossil samples (table 3); in three cases
(OMTai14, 39, and 46) it was possible to amplify a 376
bp fragment. All specimens identified as SHs that yielded
cyt b sequence were identical. Only partial sequence data
could be recovered for OMWra2 and OMYak12 (table 3).
However, for comparable runs of sequence, these specimens were identical to all other SHs.

Owing to institutional sampling restrictions and the low
quality of retrieved DNA, analysis of OMTai95 had to be
based on one repetition of each of the two overlapping
fragments. Although results for this specimen are therefore tentative, its sequence does not differ from that of
OMTai38 and OMTai 46 (not shown). Thus, despite some
individual variation, in all cases samples could be classed
unambiguously as either EH or SH.
Specimens in the EH group differed uniformly from those
classed as SH by three fixed differences (table 3, positions
324, 346, and 366). There were also some internal differences within the EH group. OMTai14 and OMTai39 possessed an additional base substitution not seen in other
members (position 436), and OMBolL15564 expressed a
unique A to G substitution at position 425. Given the difficulties encountered in determining the mitochondrial
HV region sequence for this last sample, this result was
excluded from analysis.
The Holocene samples (N = 43) exhibited no variations.
Only one haplotype was retrieved (table 4), which is consistent with Groves and Shields' [8] evidence for limited
among-individual variation at the cyt b locus in living
muskoxen. By contrast, the Pleistocene samples yielded 2
haplotypes among 4 sequences and thus greater amongindividual haplotype and nucleotide diversity in a much
smaller sample.

for parsimony/neighbor joining/maximum likelihood at each

statistical support) for a given grouping in only one instance,
significance of results should not be overemphasized. Nevertheless, it is parsimonious to conclude that (1) all muskoxen
form a cluster as against sheep and goat, and (2) moderns
form a structureless subcluster as against the extinct haplotype represented by OMTai39.

As a proxy for resolving the magnitude of differences
among cyt b haplotypes, 1,180 bp of sequence in overlapping fragments was determined for one of the best-performing specimens, OMTai39 (table 5) and aligned by eye
against 5 modern muskox cyt b sequences deposited in
GenBank (accession numbers U17862 and U90300U90303, here designated as OMMod01-05). Among

modern muskoxen, within-group differences in cyt b
sequences range from 1 to 4 base substitutions (table 5).
By comparison, OMTai39 differed from all modern
samples by 5–7 substitutions. Domestic sheep (Ovis aries)
[GenBank: NC001941] and goat (Capra hircus) [GenBank:
NC005044] were used as outgroups for phylogenetic
analysis. The takin Budorcas taxicolor was not included in
the analysis as Groves and Shields [8] have shown that the
relationship between this species and muskox is not
demonstrably closer than that of other caprines. When
submitted to phylogenetic testing using maximum parsimony, neighbor joining, and maximum likelihood methods, OMTai39 placed in all analyses outside modern
muskoxen cyt b sequences (bootstrap support, 80–98%)
supporting the distinctiveness of Pleistocene vs. Holocene
haplotypes (fig. 4).
Hypervariable region
Samples from Yukon and islands in the Canadian Arctic
Archipelago (OMYuk01, OMArA03, OMArA04, and
OMArA05) displayed minor haplotype variation affecting
2–4 positions in the studied portion of the hypervariable
region (additional fig. 1). No fixed differences were found
between these samples and sequence data on modern
muskoxen in GenBank [7](cf. OMMod01-08, OMModCl,
table 5).

One position in the GenBank samples was not observed
in any of the fossil sequences, nor was it found in a modern muskox sequence (OMModC1) that was acquired specifically to test results from this study (table 6, position
168). Because all of the sequences presented here are consensus results, generated from multiple PCRs and multiple clones sequenced on both strands, the difference in
the database for modern samples is best interpreted as a
sequencing artifact in the published sequences.
OMTai23658, one of two Holocene samples from Taimyr,
yielded two unique haplotypes for the hypervariable
region, identified here as A and B (table 6, position 144).
Multiple PCRs, cloning, and sequencing of clones by two
independent laboratories established that these haplotypes differ by 1 base, the difference likely being due to
heteroplasmy (additional fig. 1; see also [26]). Haplotype
A differed by 0–2 positions and haplotype B by 1–3 positions from sequences recovered for other fossil muskoxen
from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The difference
between both haplotypes of OMTai23658 and modern
muskoxen was 1–3 substitutions.
All of the other successfully sequenced samples from
Taimyr (OMTai14, OMTai38, OMTai39, and OMTai46)
are of Pleistocene age (> 10,000 years ago). They were
found to differ by 0–3 substitutions from one another but

sequences, and ones that diverge from all others encountered in the course of this study (additional fig. 4). Since
results for this specimen were highly inconsistent, we suspect some form of sample contamination but cannot
identify the likely source. This required that we remove it
form further analysis.
As may be seen in table 4, the Pleistocene sequences had
more transversions (2 of 5 mutations) and slightly higher
haplotype and nucleotide diversity per site measured than
did Holocene sequences. However, given the almost 9fold higher representation of Holocene compared to Pleistocene sequences, the statistics should be treated with caution. Higher among-sequence diversity (i.e., 2 haplotypes
from 4 sequences as opposed to 4 from 44) for Holocene
samples supports the concept that genetic diversity in
muskoxen has been restricted. This is also consistent with
the results obtained for cyt b (table 4).

by 2–6 positions from modern muskoxen and the Canadian fossil samples. In addition, all the Pleistocene Taimyr
samples presented 1 fixed difference not observed in any
of the other samples studied (table 6, position 104), while
OMTai38 and OMTai46 shared 2 base changes not found
in any other specimen group (table 6, positions 148 and
166). OMTai14 and OMTai39 shared one position not
found in any other specimen group (table 6, position 2).
The DNA yield from one other sample, OMBolL15564
from the New Siberian Islands, was low. However, it
yielded reproducible EH sequence for cyt b. This is consistent with the sample's origin (near Taimyr) and age (late
Pleistocene). Unfortunately, the HV region yielded several
different sequences per amplification, including
sequences that were similar to SH sequences, EH

To further clarify among-sequence relationships, we
depict the sequence network suggested by our data in figure 5: nodes reflect missing intermediates and correlate
with the number of mutational steps between sequences.
As expected, all haplotypes of the SH group are very
closely related. Most of the extinct haplotypes recovered
differ somewhat among themselves, and all Taimyr EHs
differ more substantially from SHs than do SHs among
themselves. The distance between the extinct haplotypes
and the closest SH sample is two to three mutational
steps. The network supports the distinctiveness of most of
the HV haplotypes of Pleistocene age.

Discussion
In view of the small number of specimens analyzed, conclusions have to be tentative. The conclusion best
supported by the data is that, compared to modern
muskoxen, late Quaternary Ovibos populations were less
homogeneous for the loci sampled in this investigation.
In particular, one group of haplotypes (EHs) occurring in
fossil specimens from northeastern Asia differs from haplotypes in existing databases (SHs). The actual number of
differences is not great (see Results), but their existence is
thrown into sharp relief by the virtual lack of variation in
the modern wildherd. In view of the multiple safeguards
utilized to insure accuracy and repeatability (extraction of
several samples in independent laboratories, sequencing
of multiple independent clones from two or more amplifications, using overlapping PCR fragments to determine
sequences, and rejection of suspect or ambiguous results),
we feel that we can exclude laboratory artifacts or DNA
damage as the source of these differences.
When the extinct haplotypes might have disappeared is
not known. In our sample, the latest accepted record (of
5) is 18,310 ± 70 yrbp (radiocarbon years before present),

Page 8 of 13

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:49

which tells us that populations in which these haplotypes
occurred survived at least into the Late Glacial Maximum,
but not whether they lasted until the period of intensified
megafaunal extinction at the end of the Pleistocene
approximately 10,000 years ago (although in view of the
extensive end-Pleistocene radiocarbon record for Ovibos
in Asia [32], we regard this as more likely than not).
Another conclusion that is supported by the limited evidence currently available is that the SH group was present
in mid-Holocene Asian muskoxen. This inference is based
on the fact that OMTai23658 from Taimyr yielded
sequence data indistinguishable from modern. (We had
less success with the only other Eurasian Holocene sample
available to us, OMTai31670. For the sequences covered it
was initially found to be identical to modern muskox, but
repeated efforts to replicate results were unsuccessful.)
Given available data, however, it is premature to conclude
that EHs were definitely not present as late as the middle
Holocene. If in the future other specimens of Holocene
age come to light in Asia, it would be well worthwhile to
sample them for aDNA studies.
A last point of interest is that Ovibos, one of the few highlatitude megafaunal mammals to have survived into
recent times, has clearly done so with reduced genetic variability. As already noted, at what point before the present
this variability was lost cannot be satisfactorily established
with existing data. For species for which aDNA sequence
information is substantially better, such as bears and
bison, there is molecular evidence for repeated loss and
turnover of haplotype diversity during the late Quaternary
(cf. [19,20,27]). Although no aDNA investigation of the
giant Irish deer, Megaloceros, has yet been published, Stuart et al. [28] have recently shown that the radiocarbon
record for this taxon reveals dramatic changes in population distributions during the late Pleistocene, followed
ultimately by total collapse in the mid-Holocene. Thus,
the data presented here, in combination with studies performed on other megafaunal species, is consistent with a
scenario in which genetic diversity in muskoxen was
reduced prior to the Pleistocene/Holocene transition.
It would also be of great interest to know whether late
Quaternary small mammals (few of which became
extinct) were affected by population crashes at the same
time as larger species were. Extensive work on the
mitochondrial genetics and phylogeography of extant
lemmings by Fedorov and coworkers [29,30] suggests
that, in these rodents at least, bottlenecking and
catastrophic loss of genetic diversity did not occur in late
glacial/postglacial time. The robustness of this inference
could be tested with aDNA methods similar to the ones
utilized here, as there are large samples of reasonably well-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/49

dated fossil lemming material in the paleontological collections of various museums (cf. [31]).

Conclusion
In summary, the combined genetic and chronometric evidence presented in this paper establishes that Ovibos moschatus was genetically more diverse in the late Pleistocene
than it is today. Precisely when haplotypes not found in
extant muskoxen were lost, and under what conditions,
are matters that cannot be well constrained at present.
However, the data decisively show that now-extinct
haplotypes persisted in Asia to a point only a few thousand years earlier than the accepted onset of the end-Pleistocene extinctions. It is reasonable to predict that, with
better sampling, it may eventually be possible to show
that populations of Ovibos moschatus, far from passing
through this period of heightened extinction unscathed,
were in fact brought down to small numbers over much of
their original range, perhaps almost to the vanishing
point [32]. Why muskoxen should have survived nevertheless in these circumstances, while many other high-latitude species did not, is yet another puzzle within the
overarching mystery of late Quaternary extinctions.

Methods
Samples
Despite their wide holarctic distribution during the late
Quaternary, ovibovines are comparatively rare as fossils
except in those few areas (e.g., Taimyr Peninsula, parts of
Yukon; fig. 1) where conditions were evidently optimal
for them during much of the late Pleistocene. We
obtained our specimens from two broad areas, designated
"New World" and "Old World" (respectively, northern
North America including the Arctic Archipelago, and the
Arctic periphery of Asia east of the Kara Sea). A total of 31
muskoxen samples were subjected to DNA extraction and
PCR amplification using various primer combinations. Of
these, 16 samples worked with varying degrees of success;
table 1 and fig. 3 provide information on these specimens
regarding locality, age, and other relevant data (see also
additional figs. 1, 2, 3, 4). The 15 remaining samples,
from Alaska, Russia, and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago,
did not produce amplifiable DNA on extraction and are
not shown. It is particularly unfortunate that none of the
Alaskan material yielded DNA. There may be an age effect:
Mateus et al. [33] showed that muskoxen were common
in Alaska earlier in the Pleistocene, but became very rare
after 40,000 yrbp (which is the upper practical limit of
radiocarbon dating). Designations combine taxon acronym/geographical origin/sample number: thus OMArA05
stands for Ovibos moschatus/Arctic Archipelago/sample 5.

previously by other workers. Age estimates are cited in
radiocarbon years before present without δ13C correction.
All Beta Analytic estimates are accelerator dates on the collagen fraction of submitted specimens and typically have
low associated standard errors. Other dates quoted in the
table are based on older liquid scintillation technology
which required large samples. However, accuracy and precision are not necessarily poorer in the latter case:
OMTai23658 has been dated by both methods, and mean
age estimates are statistically indistinguishable at 2 sigmas
(table 1).
All samples yielded 13C/12C ratios within normal ranges
for the materials dated (usually bone), and no difficulties
with any samples were reported by the radiocarbon laboratory. Radiocarbon age estimates in excess of 40,000 yrbp
are generally considered to be of questionable accuracy,
and specimens so dated could be considerably older [37].
Although EH samples are generally older than SH samples, there is overlap around the time of the Last Glacial
Maximum 21,000 calendar years ago [38], indicating that
haplotype groups were coeval. Greater temporal overlap
would probably have been found had sample sizes been
larger.

Fig. 2 collates published finite 14C records for the study
areas in the Old and New Worlds. Note that the distribution of dates in the New World record is quite asymmetrical, with few early dates and a heavy concentration in the
late Holocene. A similar asymmetry is seen in fig. 3, which
depicts the date distribution of specimens used in this
study. The explanation concerns substantial differences in
the amount of habitable range available to muskoxen during the period covered by radiocarbon dating. Because
almost all of Canada and Greenland were covered by icecaps in the last (late Wisconsinan) cold phase, few early
muskox dates would be expected from this area. Following icecap retreat, the muskoxen record increases markedly, especially after the mid-Holocene with return of a
significant biomass of vascular plants at high latitudes
[39]. By contrast, the Arctic periphery of Asia was not significantly glaciated, and muskox were evidently present
throughout this zone during the latest Pleistocene, but
rare or absent thereafter until ~4,000 yrbp when they
made a brief reapperance.
DNA extraction, PCR, and sequencing
All fossil samples were collected by the first author using
an electric drill with stainless steel "keyhole" coring drill
bits that were cleaned and air dried after each use. Samples
were placed in individual plastic containers, labeled, and

stored while in the field in cool conditions and on return
in a -20°C freezer in an isolated lab. Protocols for DNA
extractions, PCR conditions, PCR reamplification, cloning
strategy, colony PCR and sequencing, have been described
in detail in Krings et al. [12] and Greenwood [34], with
the variant that (for most samples) DNA extractions were
conducted with NucleoSpin® DNA-Trace Kits in combination with NucleoSpin® funnel columns (Macherey &
Nagel), Gene Clean Kit (Qbiogene), or GOLD Forensic
DNA Kit (peqlab) according to manufacturer protocols
and eluted in 55 to 60µl 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Reamplifications of PCR products when necessary were done
either by direct amplification from of an aliquot of the
first PCR or subsequent to gel extraction of the primary
amplification band using a Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit. A
buffer control was taken through each extraction
procedure with no sample added and used as a PCR negative control in each PCR reaction to control for
contamination. PCR primers, combinations used, and
sequences are shown in table 2. Modern hair and blood
DNA were prepared in a separate laboratory and never
brought to laboratories conducting aDNA work so as to
avoid potential contamination. Both hair and blood were
prepared using Qiagen QIAamp DNA Mini Kits and PCR
performed using Roche Expand Taq or Promega Taq
polymerase according to manufacturer instructions. PCR
conditions used were 30 cycles of 94°C 30 seconds, 50°C
30 seconds and 72°C 30 seconds. Products were cloned
and clones sequenced as described in Greenwood (2002).

[36] with Ovis (sheep) and Capra (goat) as outgroups for
the nearly-complete cyt b sequence of OMTai39 (fig. 4).
Although 100 bootstrap replicates were performed for
each tree generated, the limited variability present in the
data requires that no great weight be placed on the results
of such experiments (i.e., chances are high that the few
variable sites will be included in the bootstrap and will
therefore nearly always replicate the same tree). Nevertheless, a strictly parsimonious interpretation of the distribution of certain fixed differences (see text) indicates that
sequence data can be used to diagnostically distinguish
extinct from surviving haplotypes. Networks for the
hypervariable region sequences derived from the alignment shown in table 6 were drawn by hand (fig. 5).

manuscript.

Additional material
Negative water controls and in many cases mock extraction controls were included in experiments to control for
contamination. Extractions, amplification, and sequencing for samples OMTai23658, OMTai39, OMTai46,
OMYuk01, OMArA03, OMArA04, and OMArA05 were
performed independently at SR&D and Medigenomix; in
each case the same sequences were obtained. Each
amplified region was covered at least twice if possible;
multiple clones were sequenced to determine the correct
sequence and to avoid mis-scoring errors due to DNA
damage [35]. In the few cases in which available material
was insufficient for double coverage, the sequence result is
regarded as tentative. The number of replications for each
PCR for each sample is indicated in table 1. Sequences
were also derived from overlapping PCR fragments as
previously described [12] (see additional fig. 1, 2, 3). [All
consensus sequences have been deposited with the following accession numbers in GenBank: AY839538AY839551 (cyt b); AY839552-AY839563 (hypervariable
region); and AY83956 (the only substantially complete
cyt b sequence retrieved in this study for OMTai39).]
