Abstract
Background: Since the drastic reorganisation of the phylogeny of the animal kingdom into three major clades of bilaterians;
Ecdysozoa, Lophotrochozoa and Deuterostomia, it became glaringly obvious that the selection of model systems with extensive
molecular resources was heavily biased towards only two of these three clades, namely the Ecdysozoa and Deuterostomia.
Increasing efforts have been put towards redressing this imbalance in recent years, and one of the principal phyla in the vanguard
of this endeavour is the Annelida.
Results: In the context of this effort we here report our characterisation of an Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) screen in the
serpulid annelid, Pomatoceros lamarckii. We have sequenced over 5,000 ESTs which consolidate into over 2,000 sequences
(clusters and singletons). These sequences are used to build phylogenetic trees to estimate relative branch lengths amongst
different taxa and, by comparison to genomic data from other animals, patterns of gene retention and loss are deduced.
Conclusion: The molecular phylogenetic trees including the P. lamarckii sequences extend early observations that polychaetes
tend to have relatively short branches in such trees, and hence are useful taxa with which to reconstruct gene family evolution.
Also, with the availability of lophotrochozoan data such as that of P. lamarckii, it is now possible to make much more accurate
reconstructions of the gene complement of the ancestor of the bilaterians than was previously possible from comparisons of
ecdysozoan and deuterostome genomes to non-bilaterian outgroups. It is clear that the traditional molecular model systems for
protostomes (e.g. Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans), which are restricted to the Ecdysozoa, have undergone
extensive gene loss during evolution. These ecdysozoan systems, in terms of gene content, are thus more derived from the
bilaterian ancestral condition than lophotrochozoan systems like the polychaetes, and thus cannot be used as good, general
representatives of protostome genomes. Currently sequenced insect and nematode genomes are less suitable models for
deducing bilaterian ancestral states than lophotrochozoan genomes, despite the array of powerful genetic and mechanistic
manipulation techniques in these ecdysozoans. A distinct category of genes that includes those present in non-bilaterians and
lophotrochozoans, but which are absent from ecdysozoans and deuterostomes, highlights the need for further lophotrochozoan
data to gain a more complete understanding of the gene complement of the bilaterian ancestor.

Background
Pomatoceros lamarckii is a tube-building serpulid annelid.
The hard, calcareous tubes are common features on hard
substrata such as rocks, marine infrastructure, molluscan
shells and large crustacean exoskeletons. As such they can
become important biofouling agents as well as being a
concern to the aquaculture industry, for example, mussel
farming. P. lamarckii has also proven to be a useful model
in marine ecotoxicology, being widespread in the intertidal and sub-littoral zones (along with its sister species
Pomatoceros triqueter) with easily accessible embryonic and
larval material [1] as well as a distinctive karyotype amenable to evaluation of gross chromosomal aberrations
and changes [2,3].
As an annelid P. lamarckii is a member of the Lophotrochozoa clade, or super-phylum, of bilaterian animals. The
lophotrochozoan clade is still relatively poorly represented in terms of genomic resources compared to the
other two major clades of bilaterians; the Ecdysozoa (containing arthropods, nematodes and other related phyla)
and the Deuterostomia (chordates, echinoderms and
hemichordates) [4]. This imbalance needs to be redressed
in order to obtain a more balanced understanding of animal genome evolution and comparative biology.
Coral ESTs [5] and the Nematostella vectensis genome [6],
and to a lesser extent the genome of Trichoplax adhaerens
[7], have revealed a surprisingly high level of gene conservation between radiate, or diploblast, animals and bilaterians, in terms of numbers of genes, gene family
representation and gene organisation. This level of surprise has to a certain extent been due to the erroneous estimated levels of gene conservation across the Bilateria due
to the bias in sampling from mainly Deuterostomia and
Ecdysozoa. The coral EST data [5] in particular revealed
that many genes that had previously been thought to be
deuterostome or vertebrate innovations, are in fact conserved with this non-bilaterian animal and hence have
been lost in the lineages leading to the ecdysozoan
genomes sampled. To truly understand these patterns of
lineage and clade-specific gene losses and conservation, a
broader phylogenetic sample of taxa must be compared.
Although the recent diploblast/Radiata to triploblast/Bilateria comparisons have clearly revised our concept of the
complexity (in genetic terms) of the last common ancestor of these groups, there is still a huge amount to be
determined about the major events in animal evolution at
the transition between these two groups, and about the
nature of the last common ancestor of the Bilateria.
Reconstructing the gene catalogue or complement of this
ancestor, from which 99% (in terms of species number) of
the extant animal kingdom subsequently evolved is a crucial goal for understanding animal evolution.

Of the handful of Annelida that do have collections of
gene sequences available, most data-sets tend to have
been produced from material exposed to specific conditions or protocols (e.g. subtractive hybridisations [8,9])
and hence whilst they give extremely valuable information about those specific processes they do not necessarily
provide enough information for obtaining a more general
picture of bilaterian evolutionary genomics. For those
annelids that do have more extensive sequence data available [10], or in production [11,12], a preliminary picture
is emerging of the great potential utility of polychaetes for
comparative biology, since species like Platynereis dumerilii
appear to have retained more of the ancestral characters
(genes and networks) from the bilaterian ancestor than
other protostome model systems [10,13,14]. Pomatoceros
provides a useful complement to annelids such as Platynereis with regard to its life history, morphology and
potentially its phylogenetic position. Pomatoceros is sedentary, living in a permanent, fixed tube, whilst Platynereis
can be considered an errant annelid, moving around its
benthic habitat. Pomatoceros has a heteronomous body
form, with a tentacular crown and distinctive head, thorax
and abdominal regions, whilst Platynereis is more homonomous, with a head and more uniform trunk. With regard
to phylogeny Pomatoceros and Platynereis are considered as
members of two of the major divisions of polychaetes, the
Aciculata (includes Platynereis) and the Canalipalpata
(includes Pomatoceros) [15]. However, recent molecular
phylogenetic data highlights the fact that the family-level
phylogeny of the annelids is rather poorly resolved and
the Aciculata and Canalipalpata may not be bona fide
groupings [16]. Clearly, a wider sampling of taxa is essential to test the general utility of polychaetes, or whether
the "less-derived" characteristics of species such as P.
dumerilii are more restricted to specific taxa.
More widely in the Lophotrochozoa whole genome
sequences are now available for a very small number of
taxa, and EST data is also available for a handful of species
[17-20]. As this type of data increases further we will be
able to expand and refine the types of analyses performed
and obtain a much clearer picture of the patterns of gene
and gene family conservation, gain and loss across the
bilaterians, and hence the gene complement of the bilaterian ancestor from which the vast majority of present-day
animals evolved.
Here we report the characterization of over 5,000 ESTs
from the annelid P. lamarckii, and make detailed comparisons of these ESTs with data from across the animal kingdom. We find that P. lamarckii exhibits relatively short
branches in molecular phylogenetic trees, permitting
clearer, more robust comparisons to genes from other taxa
than is possible with very long-branch organisms such as
Caenorhabditis elegans and Ciona intestinalis. We have clas-

sified the P. lamarckii sequences that have orthologues in
other animals into categories that reveal patterns of gene
loss from the Ecdysozoa and/or Deuterostomia. It is clear
that the ecdysozoan genomes sampled to date have
undergone a significant amount of gene loss relative to the
other bilaterian clades. If we are to understand the function of these genes we cannot rely on the more traditional
protostome model systems of insects and nematodes
from which these genes have been lost. As well as genes
that are widely conserved across two or three of the major
bilaterian clades we find a class of genes that is ancient in
the animals, being conserved with non-bilaterian animals, but which appears to have been retained only in a
single bilaterian super-phylum, in this case the Lophotrochozoa. Such genes may reveal specific aspects of lophotrochozoan biology. A further class of genes that are
restricted to only lophotrochozoan animals are also
promising candidates for understanding the evolution
and biology of this important group of animals, and may
provide candidates for exploitation for resolving the phylogeny of the lophotrochozoan phyla.

Results and Discussion
A collection of larval genes in P. lamarckii: assembly
statistics
A total of 5664 ESTs were generated from a non-normalised cDNA library of P. lamarckii larvae. These sequences
are available under GenBank accession numbers
GR308222 to GR312353. The ProcessEST in-house pipeline programme denoted 1794 of these as singletons, and
clustered the remainder to form 521 contigs. Singletons
have a mean length of 655 bp, whilst contigs have a mean
length of 967 bp. Of the 42 clusters containing 10 or more
EST individual sequences, the majority code for ribosomal
proteins, together with house-keeping genes such as elongation factor 1-alpha (see Additional file 1). However, 6
clusters do not yield significant matches to any other proteins or ribosomal RNA in any database at all. They consist of at least 12 ESTs respectively, indicating that 6
unique sequences are expressed at a high level, when considering the contig for elongation factor 2 (Contig 527) is
composed of 12 ESTs. They do not show any matches to
registered micro RNA datasets on the miRBase [21] and
further work must identify what these sequences code for
and why they are expressed at relatively high levels in
development of P. lamarckii.

GC content averages at 40% across all singletons and contigs, which do not present evidence for genome-wide
selection for particularly high or low GC content in P.
lamarckii. Against half of all ESTs, we conducted a search
for start Methionine residues, which yielded 154 ESTs for
which it was very likely that the start codon had been
reached based on matches to the start site of orthologous
proteins along with in-frame stop codons being further 5'

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/240

to these putative start codons. 5'-untranslated regions
(UTRs) have a mean length of 90.0 bp, although these 5'UTRs are not necessarily all complete due to the way the
library was constructed by reverse transcription. Local
BLASTn searches within the 5'-UTRs of P. lamarckii
revealed no evidence for trans-splicing, which has been
observed in several other bilaterian phyla [22].
Shorter P. lamarckii branch lengths than 'traditional'
invertebrate genomic models
To obtain a general view of P. lamarckii gene evolution, we
conducted a phylogenetic analysis with 11 other species.
These species were chosen due to availability of genome
data and also to provide a balanced representation of the
three bilaterian super-phyla along with an outgroup, consistent with the latest views of animal phylogeny [23]. A
total of 59 orthologous genes were found in all 12 species,
forming a concatenated alignment of 11,716 sites, of
which 44.2% are informative. See Additional file 2 for a
complete list of orthologues and their accession numbers
used for this analysis. The concatenated amino acid
sequence of a sea anemone (N. vectensis) was used in
order to root the tree.

The phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1A and 1B) is noteworthy for two principal things; topology and branch lengths.
First, the tree topologies of both the neighbour-joining
and the maximum likelihood methods are consistent with
the latest views on animal phylogeny of the three clades of
the Bilateria [23], with very high support values. The classification of the three super-phyla in the Bilateria, namely
the Ecdysozoa, Lophotrochozoa and Deuterostomia, was
first proposed by Aguinaldo et al. [4] based on the
sequences of small subunit ribosomal RNA. As this view
of phylogeny was contradictory to the traditional view of
bilaterian phylogeny based mainly on the anatomy of the
coelom, the proposal of the three bilaterian clades has
often been criticised [24]. However, growing evidence
from analyses with datasets from more taxa, and using
more appropriate analytical methods, support the threesuperphylum phylogeny [23,25]. Our analysis also conforms to the three bilaterian superphylum topology (Figure 1A and 1B). Amongst 11 bilaterian species analysed, 5
species (Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Apis
mellifera, Tribolium castaneum, C. elegans) are grouped into
one clade corresponding to the Ecdysozoa, 3 species (P.
lamarckii, Capitella sp. I, Lottia gigantea) to the Lophotrochozoa and 3 species (Branchiostoma floridae, C. intestinalis
and Homo sapiens) to the Deuterostomia. It is noteworthy
that our trees place C. elegans into the Ecdysozoa.
Although C. elegans is a major model species for invertebrates, it is often excluded from this sort of phylogenetic
study to avoid possible tree topology artefacts due to the
extremely increased rate of base substitution observed in
this species. The long-branch length in our trees reflects

the rapid sequence evolution of C. elegans, but this has not
prevented the resolution of Ecdysozoa in this case. Our
trees are also compatible with the recent revision of chordate phylogeny [26,27], in which the cephalochordate,
amphioxus (Branchiostoma), is now considered to be the
basal extant chordate lineage and the urochordates the sister group to the vertebrates. Another noteworthy point is
the grouping of A. mellifera with T. castaneum as sisters.
This is contrary to the prevalent view of insect phylogeny
in which beetles would be the most basal lineage of the
insects represented in our trees [28]. This variability in tree

topologies amongst different studies may reflect insect
phylogeny being in the process of revision with the input
of large molecular datasets in recent phylogenomic studies [29].
Secondly, the branch lengths clearly highlight the significant (P < 0.001) disparity in evolutionary rates between
the 'traditional' genomic models of Drosophila, Caenorhabditis and Ciona and other bilaterians (Figure 1A and 1B,
and also see Additional file 3 for distance values). By contrast to these model species, polychaetes (P. lamarckii and

Capitella sp. I) are amongst the lineages with some of the
shortest branch lengths along with amphioxus (B. floridae) in the Deuterostomia and beetle (T. castaneum) in the
Ecdysozoa. These 'shorter branch length' species, therefore, are likely to be less derived from the ancestral bilaterian condition and so potentially be of greater utility for
future phylogenetic and gene evolution analysis than the
traditional protostome models of flies and nematodes.
We also conducted a similar analysis with a P. dumerilii
dataset included (unpublished data) and these branch
lengths were not significantly different from the trees
shown here. Hence, polychaetes as a whole are probably
good models for understanding sequence evolution.

genome assemblies (17 animal species) at a BLAST cut-off
score of 10-10 (Figure 2A). This percentage is strikingly
similar to that recently found in a large-scale EST sequencing project in the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii,
where 48% of the unique sequences had no significant
match against GenBank when using the same cut-off value
[30]. This similarity indicates that the P. lamarckii genome
is not subject to any pronounced stochastic process that
precludes gene identification by similarity searches.
The remaining 47.8% of the EST sequences were divided
into classes based upon their putative orthology (by
BLAST analysis) to sequences (including genomic information of 17 animal species) in major metazoan groupings. The majority of these (807 genes, 35% of the total
EST set) were found in both deuterostomes and ecdysozoans. In addition to genes with general function such as
house-keeping genes, this group includes some key genes

in animal development that have just recently been
shown to be conserved in the Lophotrochozoa as well as
the other two groups. For example, orthologues involved
in the Notch signalling pathway (pl_xlvo_29e01, Contig
245) [31] or Toll signalling (pl_xlvo_21f05,
pl_xlvo_25c05) [32] are found in our collection (See
Additional file 4 for all information on gene annotation
in this category).
A relatively large proportion (158 genes, 6.8% of the total
EST set) was found in lophotrochozoans and deuterostomes only, and not ecdysozoans (Figure 2A and 2B).
These genes may well have been lost in the lineage of the
Ecdysozoa. By contrast only 23 genes (1.0%) are conserved between lophotrochozoans and ecdysozoans only,
and are seemingly absent from deuterostomes. From this
contrast of the numbers between these two groups (158
versus 23, Figure 2B), we can infer that gene loss has been
more prevalent from the Ecdysozoa than the Deuterostomia. In many analyses, hypotheses about gene evolution
only take into account data from a limited range of model
animals in either the Deuterostomia or the Ecdysozoa,
due to the paucity of information available for the Lophotrochozoa. This analysis indicates that these studies are
likely to overestimate the number of novel genes in the
Deuterostomia, as ecdysozoans appear to have undergone
significant gene loss.
Using the BLAST cut-off score of 10-10 is a rather conservative approach and undoubtedly there will be some
orthologues that will be missed by using such a cut-off,
particularly for genes with comparatively high evolutionary rates. However, there is no a priori reason to expect
that this failure to detect orthologues for 'fast-clock' genes
should be biased towards any particular animal superphylum, since each super-phylum contains 'slow clock' as
well as 'fast clock' lineages. Furthermore, use of a more
permissive cut-off of 10-6 altered the total numbers of
genes in each class, but did not change the overall patterns
reported here. Further whole genome sequences, particularly from the Ecdysozoa and Lophotrochozoa, will enable the patterns described here to be refined and the
hypothesis of greater levels of gene loss in the Ecdysozoa
to be tested even more robustly.
In this analysis, we chiefly compared the numbers of P.
lamarckii EST genes in three groups; (1) a group comprising genes conserved in all three bilaterian super-phyla, (2)
a group containing genes found only in deuterostomes
and lophotrochozoans, which therefore may well have
been lost from the Ecdysozoa, and, (3) a group lost from
(or never gained by) the Deuterostomia (the "Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa only" group). Figure 3A and 3B
show the comparison of Gene Ontology (GO) classifications associated with EST sequences in each of the three

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/240

groups using characteristics based on mappings to predicted "molecular function" and "biological process". As
the numbers of genes and annotated GO terms in each
group are varied, it would not be appropriate to draw
detailed conclusions directly from this comparison. There
are no obvious major biases of GO classification in the
types of gene that are being lost, notwithstanding the fact
that the 'Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa" class, that represents genes either lost from, or never gained by the Deuterostomia, contains only 23 genes and will inevitably be
subject to category sampling error. The possible exception
is the genes of the "Structural molecule activity" category,
which contains 11% of GO annotations associated with
the ESTs conserved in all three super-phyla, but only 3%
of GO annotations associated with the ESTs lost from
Ecdysozoa (the "Lophotrochozoa and Deuterostomia
only" class). Moreover, our statistical analysis using the
Fisher's Exact Test showed that the genes related to the
"Structural molecule activity" are significantly overrepresented in the group conserved in all three super-phyla,
and underrepresented in the other two groups against the
whole dataset (adjusted p-value < 0.01). Perhaps genes
related to structural function are less likely to be lost during animal evolution. Details of genes in each of the three
groups and their annotation are found in Additional files
4, 5 and 6.
Interestingly, GO annotations in the 'reproduction' category contribute 2% of the GO annotations for the genes
conserved within all the three super-phyla but 7% of the
GO annotations conserved between the "Lophotrochozoa
and Deuterostome only" (none of these reproduction GO
annotations are found in the group conserved in the
"Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa only"). Perhaps the
genes in this category tend to be more easily lost particularly from the ecdysozoan lineage: this observation is statistically
supported
(underrepresented
in
the
"Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa only", adjusted p-value
< 0.01). The Pomatoceros reproductive genes of which
orthologues are not found in any ecdysozoan genomes
but which are conserved with the Deuterostomia include;
sperm flagellar 2 protein (pl_xlvo_03f08), spermatogenesis associated 4 protein (pl_xlvo_13g04), spermatogenesis
serine-rich 1 protein (pl_xlvo_14h03), sperm associated
antigen 17 protein (pl_xlvo_21e04) and spermatogenesis
associated 18 protein (pl_xlvo_21h03). Little is known
about the evolutionary origin of spermatogenesis as the
majority of research on spermatogenesis is limited to
mammalian systems. Spermatogenesis research outside
vertebrates is primarily conducted on Drosophila.
Although some similarity of Drosophila spermatogenesis
to mammals is already known [33], our data suggest that
molecular mechanisms underlying spermatogenesis have
possibly been more modified in the lineage of the Ecdysozoa, including Drosophila, than in the Lophotrochozoa.

Figure 3 of GO annotations associated with EST datasets amongst three major animal groupings after conservation analysis
Comparison
Comparison of GO annotations associated with EST datasets amongst three major animal groupings after
conservation analysis. (A and B) GO classification according to major GO categories (level 2) by both molecular function
(A) and biological process (B) for ESTs classified into three groups, 1) conserved within all three bilaterian clades (807 genes),
2) found only in the Lophotrochozoa and Deuterostomia (lost in the Ecdysozoa, 158 genes) and 3) found only in the Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa (lost from, or never gained by the Deuterostomia, 23 genes).

It may well be fruitful to investigate the molecular genetics
of spermatogenesis in annelids, to gain a more robust picture of the extent of conserved mechanisms between protostomes and deuterostomes. Also, in relation to these
'reproduction' genes, a Pomatoceros orthologue of vertebrate placenta-specific 8 protein is present in the "Lophotrochozoa and Deuterostomia only" group. Although we
do not know the functional properties of this protein, this

is one of the most highly expressed genes in our EST collection (Contig 530 includes 12 ESTs and Contig 194 contains 2 ESTs; the separation into 2 contigs is due to
polymorphisms), suggesting a prominent role in an early
larval biology process in P. lamarckii.
The number of the genes from our dataset that have been
lost from the Ecdysozoa is 158, far more than the 23 genes

lost from the Deuterostomia. Together with the phylogenetic analysis discussed in the previous section, this result
indicates that ecdysozoan genomes have undergone more
modifications during evolution, and as a result, are more
divergent from, and have lost more genes than those of
the two other super-phyla in the Bilateria, namely the
Lophotrochozoa and Deuterostomia. As our analyses are
based on sequences of lophotrochozoans, primarily P.
lamarckii, we could not estimate the number of the genes
that might have been lost in the lineage of the Lophotrochozoa from our data. However, in a study using a cnidarian EST dataset, a similar conclusion of extensive
ecdysozoan gene loss has also been suggested [5]. The
study compared 1376 ESTs of a sea coral Acropora millepora
with genomic data from D. melanogaster, C. elegans and H.
sapiens. Since this coral EST report, more molecular data
from a greater variety of taxa and several more genome
projects have become available. We included the latest
information available here (for example, genomic information of 5 species in the Ecdysozoa including a crustacean Daphnia pulex). We can, therefore, infer with more
confidence that extensive gene loss may have occurred not
only in the model ecdysozoans such as D. melanogaster
and C. elegans but could be a more general event for the
Ecdysozoa as a whole. However, the majority of genomic
data is still biased towards two major groups in the Ecdysozoa, nematodes and arthropods, and we need genomic
information from further ecdysozoan phyla (such as priapulids) to enable us to draw this conclusion with even
greater confidence.
One of the major differences from the previous cnidarian
EST work is that because our analysis is based on
sequences of the Lophotrochozoa, it provides more precise information about the gene loss/gain situation within
the Bilateria. From comparison between the Cnidaria and
the three model animals in the Deuterostomia and Ecdysozoa, it is impossible to decide whether the genes that are
uniquely found in deuterostomes are novel genes in the
Deuterostomia, or they were already present in a common
metazoan ancestor but were subsequently lost in the Cnidaria as well as the Ecdysozoa. Inclusion of lophotrochozoan data, as we have done here, provides much greater
resolution as to the genes that are, and are not, deuterostome-specific and so have been changed on the lineage
leading to ourselves. A good example is the thyroid hormone system. It was originally thought to be a unique system in chordates as the genes related to this system had
not been found elsewhere [34]. Indeed the amphioxus
thyroid system has recently been shown to induce metamorphosis [35], suggesting that mechanisms underlying
metamorphosis are conserved between protochordates
and vertebrates. When the related genes were then found
in non-chordate animals, including the lophotrochozoan
Aplysia [36], the evolutionary origin of the genetic basis of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/240

this important hormonal system was realised to be older
than previously thought. In our study, we also detected a
Pomatoceros gene orthologous to the chordate iodothyronine deiodinase gene (pl_xlvo_36e12). This EST encodes
the downstream region of a domain known to be important for vertebrate deiodinase function [37], but further
work to isolate more upstream sequence of this gene will
be required to determine whether this gene encodes an
active deiodinase. In any case, functional analysis of these
genes in lophotrochozoans will facilitate our understanding of the evolutionary origin of the thyroid system as well
as metamorphosis.
Metazoan genes lost from both Deuterostomia and
Ecdysozoa
Reconstructing the gene complements, or repertoires, of
the last common ancestor of the Bilateria and Metazoa are
important goals for evolutionary biology, due to these
ancestors having been the starting points for the major
diversifications of the animal kingdom. Several recent
whole genome scale studies [6,7,38] suggest that ancient
animal genomes may have been more complicated than
originally thought, with previous misconceptions arising
from limited taxon sampling that was largely restricted to
a small handful of (often derived) model organisms. In
this regard, lophotrochozoan data such as our P. lamarckii
EST dataset can reveal genes that originated in the common ancestor of the Metazoa and were retained into the
bilaterian ancestor, but have been lost in both the Deuterostomia and Ecdysozoa, and were therefore previously
regarded as genes specific to non-bilaterian animals.

By comparison of our data with available genomes,
including three non-bilaterian species [6,7,38], 11 genes
appear to be exclusively shared between non-bilaterians
(the Cnidaria, Placozoa and Porifera) and P. lamarckii, but
have been lost in all other bilaterian taxa so far examined.
These 11 ESTs were fully sequenced and further characterised since these genes have the potential to reveal particular aspects of lophotrochozoan and bilaterian ancestor
biology that cannot be extrapolated from the traditional
model systems in the Ecdysozoa and Deuterostomia. The
information gathered for each gene is summarised in
Table 1. Seven of these genes are conserved with cnidarians (Acropora, Nematostella and Hydra) (see Table 1). Two
ESTs (pl_xlvo_44b10 [GenBank: GQ381301] and
pl_xlvo_47g05 [GenBank: GQ381303]) are conserved
even with the unicellular choanoflagellate Monosiga
which is a protist lineage relatively closely related to the
Metazoa. The remaining 4 genes have been lost even in
the cnidarian genomes sampled, and are only conserved
with placozoan or sponge genomes. From these latter 4
genes, Contig 270 [GenBank: GQ381302] and 381 [GenBank: GQ381305] are similar to each other but are in fact
different genes (42.4% similarity at the amino acid level).

Domain prediction and descriptions are from INTERPROSCAN and/or PROSITE. Three columns at right side show presence/absence (+/-) of
orthologue for each EST in non-bilaterian genomes searched. The entire sequences of these ESTs are available under GenBank accession numbers
GQ381295 to GQ381305.

Of the 11 genes, four appear to have an enzymatic function, two are presumably involved in calcium signalling,
one has similarity to apextrin (a cnidarian developmental
gene) [GenBank: ABK63971], one has similarity to nucleoporin and therefore appears to be a structural protein,
and three are completely uncharacterised. Apextrin is also
found in echinoderms and in amphioxus, therefore if
pl_xlvo_53g01 [GenBank: GQ381304] is an apextrin
orthlogue, it is also found in non-lophotrochozoan bilaterians and should be discounted from the lophotrocho-

zoan/non-bilaterian group. Interestingly, pl_xlvo_53g01
also contains a kringle domain [Pfam:PF00051], which is
absent from all other apextrins, and places doubt as to the
orthology assignment to apextrin. It is likely that
pl_xlvo_53g01 is in fact a distinct protein and only
matches apextrin in BLAST searches due to the MAC
domain [Pfam:PF01823] which is shared between these
genes. This example demonstrates that the methods utilised to assign orthology in large scale EST surveys such as
ours (i.e., similarity searching by the BLAST algorithm) are

susceptible to error and can only be used to obtain a
broad idea of the biology of P. lamarckii, more precise
assessments of orthology require further, focused
sequencing and individual assessment of each gene.
Of the 11 genes that are shared between P. lamarckii and
non-bilaterian animals, 6 are conserved with other lophotrochozoan animals, Capitella and/or Lottia. In a study
analogous to our analysis, Moroz and colleagues used an
Aplysia EST dataset, and reported 20 genes that were
uniquely shared between the cnidarian Hydra and Aplysia
[19]. One specific example was the universal stress protein
superfamily [Pfam:PF00582; COGs:COG0589] that had
been thought to be limited to the Archaea, Eubacteria and
plants. Following the discovery of cnidarian orthologues
[39], Moroz and colleagues found Aplysia orthologues and
argued that such genes have been lost from the other two
bilaterian super-phyla. We also found a P. lamarckii orthologue (Contig 136). However, in our analysis we classified
this gene into the group of the genes that are lost in Ecdysozoa ("Lophotrochozoa and Deuterostomia only") since
we found some orthologues in a Ciona genome [GenBank:
XP_002122447,
XP_002130756,
XP_002130444,
XP_002130531,
XP_002130913,
XP_002130652,
XP_002119695, XP_002130688]. As this example shows,
this type of analysis benefits from more data from a wider
variety of species, and our results could be revised after
more information becomes available. Nonetheless, some
of these genes could be keys to understand unique features of lophotrochozoan biology, as well as aspects of the
bilaterian ancestor that cannot be inferred from traditional ecdysozoan and deuterostome model systems.

Pomatoceros genes restricted to lophotrochozoans
The Lophotrochozoa are not only an important clade for
understanding the ancestry of metazoans and bilaterians,
but are also themselves an extremely diverse group of animals exhibiting much evolutionary change and novelty
which is likely to involve, at least to some extent, lophotrochozoan-specific genes. We found that 96 Pomatoceros
ESTs are uniquely conserved within the Lophotrochozoa
only. The genes classified into this group are shared
between P. lamarckii and at least one more species in the
Lophotrochozoa. Amongst the 96 genes, 62 genes are conserved only in annelids (e.g., Capitella sp. I or Helobdella
robusta). Since most BLAST matches in this Lophotrochozoa-restricted group are to merely computationally predicted proteins, we do not have much information about
their biological function at present. Thus we analysed
functional domains and cellular localisation using the
computer programmes, INTERPROSCAN, CDD and
PSORT. The results are summarised in Additional file 7.
This list of the genes will provide a basis for future molecular analysis of P. lamarckii, annelids and the Lophotrochozoa.

Although functional characterisation and annotation for
most of the genes in this category requires future analysis,
the biological properties of a small number (7 genes) have
been functionally analysed in other lophotrochozoan species, and they predominantly have neuromuscular roles.
All seven of them show a high level of similarity at the
protein level and their function is likely to be conserved in
Pomatoceros. Table 2 lists the P. lamarckii ESTs with functions characterised in other lophotrochozoan taxa.

EST (pl_xlvo_23a09) shows high similarity to an Aplysia
PRQFVamide precursor protein [GenBank: AAO73964].
The PRQFVamide was identified as a novel pentapeptide
from Aplysia [40], expressed in the central nervous system
and gut. It suppresses contraction of the gut and vasculature and is suggested to act as a modulator within the feeding system. Interestingly, pl_xlvo_23a09 does not have a
repeat of the exact PRQFV motif identified in Aplysia.
Instead, its repeated motif has a deletion of a glutamine at
the third position or it has other types of -FV amide motif
that are shared with the three neuropeptide families in
Aplysia such as AMRPs [41] and enterins [42]. We therefore completely sequenced the clone from which the original EST was derived and obtained a provisional fulllength cDNA [GenBank: GQ381306] (see Additional file
8). It is still difficult to determine the correspondence of
this gene to the three Aplysia precursors of -FV amide neuropeptides, however, the neuropeptides from this Pomatoceros gene are likely to act on the gut in Pomatoceros as
well, since all three families of Aplysia -FV amide neuropeptides have a similar function.
Two EST clones (pl_xlvo_33f01 and pl_xlvo_58g09) are
well conserved amongst annelids, P. lamarckii, Capitella
sp. I and H. robusta. These two genes have related sequence
motifs, but encode two different proteins (only 19.4%
similarity at the amino acid level). And both show the
same top match to the Lumbricus 29-kDa galactose-binding lectin [GenBank: BAA36393] [43] that was originally
identified as a galactose-specific lectin. The top BLAST
match, as well as the outcome of INTERPROSCAN and
CDD, indicated that these predicted proteins are Pomatoceros galactose-binding lectins with the Ricin B lectin
motifs [InterPro:IPR000772, IPR008997; CDD:cd00161].
This identification was confirmed by completion of the
entire EST clone sequence of 58g09, which provided a
probable full-length cDNA [GenBank: GQ381307] (see
Additional file 8).
The EST pl_xlvo_42f05 is highly similar to a Capitella gene
[JGI:jgi|Capca1|204689|fgenesh1_pg.C_scaffold_170000
04] that shows a unique match to cerebrin prohormone
[GenBank: AAM00268], which has a profound effect on
the feeding motor pattern in Aplysia [44]. Despite its
remarkable effect on the feeding motor pattern, there are
no similar peptides reported outside gastropods; however,
as both annelid genes encode a highly conserved region
corresponding to the 17-residue peptides of cerebrin as
well as two dibasic cleavage sites (Figure 4A), it is very
likely that these genes encode Pomatoceros and Capitella
orthologues of Aplysia cerebrin prohormone.
Although a clustered sequence (Contig 102) does not
show any significant BLAST matches, apart from a
Capitella
predicted
sequence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/240

[JGI:jgi|Capca1|226681|estExt_fgenesh1_pg.C_470016],
the INTERPRO analysis predicted that the protein
encoded by this gene includes amino acid sequences that
appear orthologous to the myoactive tetradecapeptide
family isolated from the gut of earthworms, Eisenia foetida
and Pheretima vitata [45] [InterPro:IPR012619]. The peptides of both earthworm species have a potent excitatory
action on spontaneous contractions of the anterior gut.
Similar tetradecapeptides have also been purified from
molluscan lophotrochozoans [46,47] and have either
excitatory or inhibitory effects on muscles, mainly of the
gastrointestinal tract. Figure 4B shows an alignment of the
conserved tetradecapeptide sequences so far reported
within the Lophotrochozoa, including the two polychaete
sequences identified here. We also found that not only is
the tetradecapeptide conserved, but the gene also has an
EF-hand calcium-binding domain at the C-terminal. To
our knowledge, no animal species outside the lophotrochozoans has this gene.
Contig 196 encodes a partial sequence of a precursor protein containing 4 copies of FMRF motifs (Additional file
8) of which the top BLAST match is the FMRFamide precursor protein of Lymnaea stagnalis (great pond snail) [48].
This tetrapeptide was first identified as a cardioexcitatory
agent from molluscs [49]. Although it was thought that
the distribution of the FMRFamide itself was limited to
molluscs, later it was shown that the FMRFamide is a part
of a large family of related peptides (FaRPs) and present
in every major metazoan phylum examined. The function
of the FMRFamide has been extensively studied in molluscs and they are involved in a wide variety of physiological processes such as feeding and reproduction (reviewed
by [50]). According to a strict interpretation of our categorisation of genes, on the basis of the 10-10 BLAST cut-off
score, the Pomatoceros FMRFamide and mollusc genes represent lophotrochozoan-specific genes, and are counted
as such in our classification here. However, further work
may be required on the classification and phylogeny of
these genes and their gene family to understand their phylogeny and taxonomic distribution more clearly, and the
relationship between these lophotrochozoan FMRFamide
genes and the "extended FMRFamide" genes of insects
[51] and the wider family of FaRPs [52].
An entire sequence of one of the EST clones forming the
Contig 84 (pl_xlvo_55b08) was determined [GenBank:
GQ381308]. It was originally categorised into the group
shared with both the Deuterostomia and Ecdysozoa in
line with our classification criteria using BLAST; however,
we found that this gene encodes a protein with an interesting structure that is only conserved within the Lophotrochozoa (Figure 4C). The predicted protein is clearly an
orthologue of Aplysia californica dopamine beta hydroxylase-like protein [GenBank: AAY42041] (E-value = 2e-73)

that was initially cloned by a large-scale nucleotome study
[19]. The C-terminal of this protein is similar to the C-terminal of DBH-like mono-oxygenase proteins that are
widely conserved across bilaterians, including two conserved regions of mono-oxygenase [Pfam:PF01082,
PF03712, the regions boxed with yellow and green lines
respectively in Figure 4C]. The DBH-like mono-oxygenase
family has a DOMON domain [Pfam:PF03351] in common at the N-terminal. In contrast, the N-terminal of both
the Pomatoceros and Aplysia proteins are only conserved
with a different Aplysia protein, the pheromone temptin
[GenBank: AAS92605] [53] and with a gene predicted
from the genome of the basal metazoan lineage Trichoplax
[GenBank: XP_002117562]. The function and structure of
Aplysia temptin have been analysed in detail, and the central 1 region of temptin (squared with red lines in Figure
4C) as well as two disulfide bonds (shown by red lines
and triangles in Figure 4C) determined by a structure analysis using recombinant temptin [54] are well conserved
amongst these genes. We have found that this unique
combination of the temptin and mono-oxygenase
sequences is also present in the Lottia genome [JGI:
jgi|Lotgi1|192843|estExt_Genewise1.C_sca_480139] but
is not found outside the Lophotrochozoa. This may be a
good example of the evolution of new genes by combining genes or exchanging domains, with the result that this
novel Temptin/mono-oxygenase 'hybrid' gene is now a
lophotrochozoan synapomorphy.

purification. Considering the importance of P. lamarckii as
a biofouling agent in the marine environment, our collection of genes provides a set of candidates that could
potentially be used to control P. lamarckii populations.

Conclusion
Comparison of patterns of gene retention across different
metazoan groups implies that ecdysozoan genomes,
including the established model systems of flies and nematodes, have undergone higher levels of gene loss than
other animal groups. Such analysis also provides a clearer
picture of the gene complement at major nodes of animal
evolution, such as the origin of the Metazoa, the origin of
the Bilateria, and the origin of the Lophotrochozoa.
Molecular phylogenetic analyses demonstrate the usefulness of annelids for evolutionary study as less divergent
species from these ancestral states than several, more traditional, invertebrate model systems. Our EST analysis
also highlights the potential for the rapid isolation of evolutionary novel genes at various evolutionary and taxonomic levels.

Methods

On the basis of our comparative sequence searches we
have concluded that this category of "lophotrochozoanspecific genes" is likely to have evolved on the lineage
leading to the Lophotrochozoa. An alternative possibility
is that at least some of these genes had a more ancient evolutionary origin in the Metazoa, but have then been lost
from the non-lophotrochozoan taxa for which genomic
data is currently available. Also the genes in this category
may have orthologues outside the lophotrochozoans, but
we failed to detect them due to high rates of sequence
divergence. This is unlikely to apply to all genes in this category however, and so these genes still form a useful starting point for understanding the evolution of
lophotrochozoan-specific biology.

Animal collection and larval culture
Adult P. lamarckii worms were collected from the littoral
zone at Tinside, Plymouth, UK, and were maintained at
12Â°C in a recirculating aquarium system. Adult worms
were removed from tubes by breaking open the posterior
section and forcing the animals backwards using a blunt
probe. Fertile animals began releasing gametes at this
stage. Male and female worms were immediately transferred to separate Petri dishes containing filtered, UV
treated seawater (FSW). Eggs were rinsed through a 100
um cell strainer (Falcon) to remove tube debris, and then
collected in a 40 um cell strainer (Falcon). The strainer
was then transferred to a Petri dish containing a dilute
sperm suspension, agitated, and left for 10 minutes to
allow fertilisation to occur. Eggs were rinsed and gently
washed into a 300 mL Pyrex crystallisation dish containing 250 mL FSW. These dishes were covered and incubated at 19Â°C. P. lamarckii trochophore larvae were
collected between 24 hours post fertilisation (hpf) and
144 hpf for RNA extraction.

Finally, the functions of some of the genes in this group
can be predicted from previous studies using other lophotrochozoan species like Aplysia. All of these genes with
functionally characterized orthologues in Aplysia are small
peptides that affect neuronal or behaviour activity, such as
neuropeptide or mating pheromones. In addition to the
genes listed in this group, our EST dataset includes several
bioactive small peptides (for example, FVRIamide
encoded by Contig 295). Biological effects of these peptides on Pomatoceros could potentially be analysed relatively easily via peptide synthesis, without protein

cDNA library construction
RNA from 24 hpf to 144 hpf larvae of P. lamarckii was isolated and a directional cDNA library was constructed by
Lofstrand Labs Ltd (Maryland, USA), using the XhoI linker
primer 5'-GAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAACTAGTCTCGAG(T18) -3'. The EcoRI adapters with the sequence 5'OH-AATTCGGCACGAGG-3' were ligated on to the blunt
5' ends before the library was column purified to remove
cDNAs shorter than 400 bp. The cDNA library was then
cloned into the XhoI/EcoRI site of the Lambda-Zap Express
vector (Stratagene, California, USA). The average insert

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:240

size was 1.05 kb. 1 Ã 106 plaque forming units were used
as a template to create an amplified library which was
then subjected to in vivo mass excision of the pBK-CMV
phagemid from the Zap Express vector.
EST isolation, sequencing and classification
After plating of the P. lamarckii cDNA library, 5664 independent clones were isolated and sequenced with the T3
vector primer. Raw sequence traces were fed into ProcessEST, an in-house pipeline system developed for the
processing and clustering of ESTs. These files are firstly
screened for vector contamination and sequence quality
using the Phred/Cross_match program [55,56]. The completed EST dataset was also screened manually for vector
sequences using local BLASTn searches. This resulted in
567 sequences being discarded. The remaining sequences
were then clustered into 2315 EST clusters using Phrap
[55,56] (730 bases average length). 1794 ESTs were
present as unique sequences, whereas 521 ESTs were represented by multiple clones.

These sequences were then used in a BLASTn analysis for
initial identification; seven sequences were identified as
ribosomal RNA or E. coli contamination and were discarded. The individual sequences constituting these
remaining 2308 EST clusters were submitted to GenBank
with accession numbers GR308222 to GR312353. For the
ESTs constituting the contigs in the text, the related contig
ID can be also found in each EST GenBank entry. Several
clones were completely sequenced with further sequencespecific oligos (see text for details), and these have GenBank accession numbers GQ381295 - GQ381308.
The 2308 EST clusters were then used in a gapped BLASTx
search against the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence
database with matches being deemed as significant if the
expect threshold was lower than 10-10. All significant
matches for each EST were then used to classify that
sequence into one of several groups depending on the
phylogenetic distribution of its identified orthologues.
These groups were: no significant matches; found in the
Lophotrochozoa, Ecdysozoa and Deuterostomia; found
in the Lophotrochozoa and Deuterostomia only; found in
the Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa only; found in the
Lophotrochozoa only; found in the Lophotrochozoa and
non-bilaterians only; found in the Lophotrochozoa and
Protista and/or Bacteria only. This was the first stage of
our classification against the whole of GenBank, to establish whether there were significant matches to non-animals, non-bilaterian animals, other lophotrochozoans,
ecdysozoans and deuterostomes.
This initial classification was further refined by the second-stage of classification against the whole genome databases of the following 16 organisms; Trichoplax adhaerens,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/240

Nematostella vectensis, Capitella sp. I, Helobdella robusta, Lottia gigantea, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Anopheles gambiae, Apis mellifera, Tribolium
castaneum, Acyrthosiphon pisum, Daphnia pulex, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Branchiostoma floridae, Ciona intestinalis and Homo sapiens. These BLAST searches were
conducted on either the Joint Genome Institute (JGI)
website [57] or on the NCBI BLAST assembled genomes
webpage [58] using BLASTx searches. The ESTs were also
submitted to tBLASTx searches of the genomic trace
records of Amphimedon queenslandica (Reneira sp JGI 2005
WGS) and the cnidarian EST dataset. The same cut-off Evalue of 10-10 was used in all BLAST searches.
Subsequently all 1103 EST sequences with any significant
matches were further analysed for annotation with GO
terms and Enzyme codes using Blast2GO [59]. For statistical assessment of GO annotation differences between
each subgroup classified by the phylogenetic distribution,
the Fisher's exact test with multiple testing corrections
(two-tailed) was conducted using the Gossip [60] package
implemented in Blast2GO. The whole dataset was used as
a reference and Family Wise Error Rate was used as the
adjusted p-value of the Fisher's exact test for each GO
term.
Phylogenetic analysis
From the group of genes that are widely conserved
amongst the animal kingdom, orthologous genes for use
in the phylogenetic analysis were identified from the 11
species: Nematostella vectensis, Capitella sp. I, Lottia
gigantea, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans,
Anopheles gambiae, Apis mellifera, Tribolium castaneum,
Branchiostoma floridae, Ciona intestinalis and Homo sapiens.
Initially it was determined whether the P. lamarckii orthologues demonstrated significant BLASTx matches to
orthologous genes in the remaining 11 species. The Evalue less than or equal to 10-10 was used as a cut-off
value. Where there were multiple paralogous matches
within the same species the gene was abandoned unless
there was a single, clear orthologue. 59 orthologous genes
were extracted from the first half of the EST screen and the
protein sequences, together with predicted amino acid
sequences from annotated genes, were obtained from the
NCBI or JGI gene databases (listed in Additional file 2).
The orthologue was not used if it was absent in any of the
11 species selected, resulting in an alignment entirely free
of gaps, except for those caused by deletions.

The protein sequences from all 12 species were aligned
using CLUSTAL W implemented in the BioEdit software
package. The sequences were then trimmed by eye of all
sites that were not unambiguously orthologous, and all
insertions were removed, unless they were the clear result
of a deletion in a minority of the species. The sequences

were then concatenated to form one large alignment. The
PHYLIP software package [61] was used to create neighbour-joining (NJ) trees using the JTT model of protein
evolution with 1000 bootstraps. For maximum likelihood
(ML) trees ProtTest 1.4 [62] was used to determine the
best protein substitution model and parameters for use in
RAxML [63]. The RtREV+I+G+F model of protein evolution was used with the proportion of invariable sites at
0.236014, 4 rates of protein evolution with alpha set at
0.849433, 100 bootstraps were used in the primary ML
tree of 12 species. A distance-based relative rate test with
RRTree [64] was performed on the concatenated alignment to examine whether relative substitution rates were
significantly different between taxa. The concatenated
amino acid sequence of N. vectensis was used as an outgroup in all the analyses.
Further analysis of the Lophotrochozoa/non-bilaterians
and the Lophotrochozoa only groups
A list of genes that were potentially shared between lophotrochozoans and non-bilaterians (to the exclusion of
other bilaterians), was compiled for complete sequencing
and further analysis. ESTs were sequenced using specific
primers designed approximately 200 bp from the end of
the contig together with the T7 primer. Once this sequencing had been finalised, the complete EST sequences were
then checked for similarity by BLAST analysis. BLASTp
was used when a clear ORF was obvious from translation
of EST sequences, BLASTx was used when this was not the
case. Each lophotrochozoan specific or lophotrochozoan/
non-bilaterian specific EST sequence was then run
through INTERPROSCAN [65] and either PROSITE [66]
or NCBI Conserved Domains search [67] to search for predicted domains, and also through PSORT [68] in order to
predict protein localisation sites.
