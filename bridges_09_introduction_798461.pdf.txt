Abstract
The Avian Genomics Conference and Gene Ontology Annotation Workshop brought together
researchers and students from around the world to present their latest research addressing the
delivery of value from the billions of base-pairs of Archosaur sequence that have become available
in the last few years. This editorial describes the conference itself and introduces the ten peerreviewed manuscripts accepted for publications in the proceedings. These manuscripts address
issues ranging from the poultry industry view of USDA genomics policy to the genomics of a wide
variety of Archeosaur species including chicken, duck, alligator, and condors and their pathogens.

Introduction
On May 19–20, 2008 the Mississippi State University
Institute for Digital Biology hosted an international meeting entitled Delivering Value from Avian Genomes. The
meeting was predicated on the fundamental need to
deliver valuable knowledge from the investment in omic
biology in avian species. In this respect it was preceded by
the Blueprint for USDA Efforts in Agricultural Animal
Genomics 2008–2017 [1] and by optimism from chicken
production industries. Specific impetuses for this meeting
were the aforementioned Blueprint, the sequencing of the
zebra finch [2] and turkey genomes [3] and the US
National Institute for Health's recognition of the impor-

tance of avian species in human disease and for biomedical research http://www.nih.gov/science/models/gallus/.
This meeting was the fourth international meeting with a
focus on chicken genomics. It followed the International
Chicken Genome Workshop (Hinxton Genome Campus,
Cambridge, UK, March 10–11, 2003) held just prior to
sequencing; the International Meeting on the Chicken
Genome (Stowers Institute of Medical Research, Kansas
City, Mo, USA, April 29 to May 2, 2004) which focused on
the initial examination of the released chicken genome
sequence; the two Workshops on Chicken Genomics & Development (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, NY, USA, May
8–11, 2005 and May 7 – 10, 2006) which focused on the

first genome-scale experimental work enabled by the
genome sequence; and the International Chick Meeting
(11–14 April 2007, Barcelona, Spain) with a major focus
on genomics and development, the immune system and
evolutionary biology.
The genomics meeting at Mississippi State University built
on these previous meetings but focused on deriving value
from the investments in genomics and functional genomics in the chicken as well as other avian genomics research.
It was also the first such meeting to focus also on "avian"
genome sequences other than chicken. From the manuscripts that follow it is clear that the combination of second generation sequencing technologies and the ability to
leverage the investment in the chicken genome sequence
has enabled Archosaur genomics (the diapsid reptiles represented by modern birds and crocodilians and including
extinct non-avian dinosaurs, pterosaurs and relatives of
crocodiles). It is also notable that, although the chicken
genome "was sequenced" by 2004 [4], it still requires
structural annotation, more targeted sequencing to elaborate specific areas, experimental validation and sequencing of the gene-rich micro-chromosomes that currently
are not included in the genome sequence at all. It is
expected that efforts to sequence the turkey and the zebra
finch will not only benefit from the chicken genome but
that these species will, in turn, enhance the chicken
genome sequence annotation. It is also likely that second
(and later)-generation sequencing technologies will help
fill in our knowledge gaps in the next few years.
Concurrently with technology advances in genome
sequencing there is clearly an understanding in the avian
research communities that, with enormous increases in
genomic data, we need to ensure that we do not lose sight
of the fundamental scientific questions. With this in mind
there has been an increase in specific practical, accessible
and user-friendly computational resources and tools dedicated to avian omic-scale biology; these will be essential
if the goals of the Blueprint for USDA Efforts in Agricultural
Animal Genomics 2008–2017 [1] are to be achieved and
for our avian models to fulfil their potential as biomedical
research tools. The manuscripts in this BMC Genomics
special supplement are those that were submitted, refereed and accepted for publication after this meeting. What
is clear from these articles is the range and depth of the
value that can be created now that the fundamental data
source, along with computational tools built in the last
five years, are available and democratizing the use this
data.

The Avian Genomics Conference was organized by Susan
M. Bridges and Shane C. Burgess. Members of the program
committee were Parker Antin, University of Arizona,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S2/I1

David Burt, Roslin Institute, Edinburgh, Scotland, Youping Deng, University of Southern Mississippi, Mark Johnson, U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and
Preventative Medicine, Fiona McCarthy, Mississippi State
University, Edward Perkins, U. S. Army Corps of Engineers
Environmental Laboratory, and Carl Schmidt, University
of Delaware. The Avian Gene Ontology (GO) Annotation
Workshop was organized by Fiona M. McCarthy of Mississippi State University and members of the program committee were: Rama Balakrishana, Stanford University,
Jennifer Clark, European Bioinformatics Institute, UK,
Judith Blake, Jackson Laboratories, and Harold Drabkin,
Jackson Laboratories.
The keynote speaker for the Avian Genomics Conference,
Dr. Scott Edwards from Harvard University is internationally known for his ground-breaking research in the
genomics based phylogenetics of many different avian
species and reptiles including dinosaurs. One of the
founders of the Gene Ontology (GO), Judith Blake of
Jackson, Laboratories was the plenary speaker for the
Avian GO Annotation Workshop.
A student poster competition was conducted and a panel
of judges selected award winners. First place was awarded
to Laura Lleras, King's College London, second place to
Ang Li, University of Southern California, and third place
tie to Catalina Tudor of the University of Delaware and
Shyamesh Kumar of Mississippi State University.
Papers submitted for inclusion in the proceedings were
peer-reviewed by two or more program committee members and other research area experts. The accepted papers
demonstrate the breadth of research enabled by the availability of avian genomes. Papers have been grouped into
several categories described in the following sections.

Poultry genomics
Janet Fulton [5] of Hy-Line International reviews the Blueprint for USDA Efforts in Agricultural Animal Genomics
2008–2017 [1] from a poultry industry perspective with a
focus on the tools, resources, and technologies specifically
required for chicken. Fulton contends that the Blueprint
has a significant bias toward the cattle industry and highlights areas where approaches in the cattle industry such
as SNP analysis do not have direct applicability for poultry. She provides an extensive discussion of infrastructure
needs for poultry research ranging from animal resource
populations to bioinformatics tools.
Behnam Abasht and colleagues [6] analyze characteristics
required for Marker Assisted Selection (MAS) in commercial layer chicken populations. Effective MAS requires
high linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers and
quantitative trail loci (QTL) and sustained marker-QTL

LD over generations. Their study uses two different methods to assess the level and consistency of LD between
SNPs to identify markers associated with egg-quality and
egg-production phenotypes. Their results indicate that
markers will retain high LD with linked QTL and be effective for MAS.
Tamsyn Crowley and colleagues [7] investigate the utility
of whole genome chicken microarrays for cross-species
analysis of other avian species including duck. They demonstrate that cross species hybridization (CSH) provides
reliable signals and that whole genome long oligonucleotide chicken microarrays provide a valuable resource for
studying gene expression in a range of avian species.
Bindu Nanduri and colleagues [8] study the transcriptional response of the gram-negative bacterial pathogen
Pasteurella multiocida, the agent of fowl cholera in poultry,
to sub-lethal doses of three different classes of antibiotics.
They demonstrate common adaptive responses to antibiotic stress and also identify differences in the responses.
Their systems biology analysis demonstrates both the possibilities and the challenges of modelling high throughput
datasets in non-model avian bacteria.

Bioinformatics resources
The utility of the chicken and other avian genomes critically depends on the development of appropriate and specialized bioinformatics tools. Consistent and meaningful
gene nomenclature fundamentally underpins bioinformatics analysis and David Burt and colleagues [9] report
the formation of the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Committee (CGNC). The CGNC, in collaboration with the
research community as a whole, will provide standardized
nomenclature for the chicken genome that reliably links
chicken genes across all databases follow nomenclature
and associated guidelines established by the Human
Genome Nomenclature Committee (HGNC).
Effective application of systems biology to emerging
model species including avians requires extensive interaction data that are often unavailable. Jay Konieczka and
colleagues
[10]
describe
the
open-source
BioNetBuilder2.0 client-server Cytoscape [11] plugin that
automatically integrates molecular interactions from all
major public interaction databases and provides these
directly to the user's Cytoscape environment. The article
includes a detailed tutorial of all steps required in the
analysis.
Using aquaporins as a case study, Raphael Isokpehi and
colleagues [12] investigate how the integration of chicken
and mammalian sequence, as well as gene expression
resources, enable functional genomics research in both
avian and mammalian species. To do so they demonstrate

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S2/I1

the types of hypotheses that can be generated by integrating a wide variety of on-line resources.

Archeosaur genomics
Previous international conferences dealing with avian
genomics had focused almost exclusively on chicken. In
contrast, the scope of Delivering Value from Avian Genomes
was consciously expanded to include all avian species and
related archosaurs such as crocodilians, lizards, and dinosaurs. Chapus and Edwards [13] use paired bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) end sequences from the
American alligator, painted turtle, emu and chicken to
investigate patterns of sequence divergence, gene and retroelement content and microsynteny in Reptilia. Their
results provide insights into the evolution of the lineage
leading to chicken including the drastic reduction in
genome size observed in birds.
Shan and colleagues [14] describe the development of a
high quality BAC library for a second crocodilian, the Australian saltwater crocodile. They demonstrate the utility of
the new resource for gene isolation, genome characterization, and comparative genomics.
Romanov and colleagues [15] demonstrate the application of genomic studies of wild birds to comprehensive
conservation including deeper understanding of mechanisms affecting genetic variation, adaptation, and evolution. They provide case studies of genotyping a California
condor resource population to provide an improved
assessment of current population genetic variation and
also genomic studies of the white-throated sparrows to
understand evolution of natural populations.
