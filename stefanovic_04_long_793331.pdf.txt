Abstract
Background: Numerous studies, using in aggregate some 28 genes, have achieved a consensus in
recognizing three groups of plants, including Amborella, as comprising the basal-most grade of all other
angiosperms. A major exception is the recent study by Goremykin et al. (2003; Mol. Biol. Evol. 20:1499–
1505), whose analyses of 61 genes from 13 sequenced chloroplast genomes of land plants nearly always
found 100% support for monocots as the deepest angiosperms relative to Amborella, Calycanthus, and
eudicots. We hypothesized that this conflict reflects a misrooting of angiosperms resulting from
inadequate taxon sampling, inappropriate phylogenetic methodology, and rapid evolution in the grass
lineage used to represent monocots.
Results: We used two main approaches to test this hypothesis. First, we sequenced a large number of
chloroplast genes from the monocot Acorus and added these plus previously sequenced Acorus genes to
the Goremykin et al. (2003) dataset in order to explore the effects of altered monocot sampling under the
same analytical conditions used in their study. With Acorus alone representing monocots, strongly
supported Amborella-sister trees were obtained in all maximum likelihood and parsimony analyses, and in
some distance-based analyses. Trees with both Acorus and grasses gave either a well-supported Amborellasister topology or else a highly unlikely topology with 100% support for grasses-sister and paraphyly of
monocots (i.e., Acorus sister to "dicots" rather than to grasses). Second, we reanalyzed the Goremykin et
al. (2003) dataset focusing on methods designed to account for rate heterogeneity. These analyses
supported an Amborella-sister hypothesis, with bootstrap support values often conflicting strongly with
cognate analyses performed without allowing for rate heterogeneity. In addition, we carried out a limited
set of analyses that included the chloroplast genome of Nymphaea, whose position as a basal angiosperm
was also, and very recently, challenged.
Conclusions: These analyses show that Amborella (or Amborella plus Nymphaea), but not
monocots, is the sister group of all other angiosperms among this limited set of taxa and that the
grasses-sister topology is a long-branch-attraction artifact leading to incorrect rooting of
angiosperms. These results highlight the danger of having lots of characters but too few and,
especially, molecularly divergent taxa, a situation long recognized as potentially producing strongly
misleading molecular trees. They also emphasize the importance in phylogenetic analysis of using
appropriate evolutionary models.

In sharp contrast stands the study of Goremykin et al.
[19], in which the Amborella chloroplast genome was
sequenced and in which 61 protein genes shared among
13 land plants (including 10 angiosperms) were analyzed.
In 31 of 33 phylogenetic analyses this study found that
"Amborella is not the basal angiosperm and not even the
deepest branching among dicots" ([19] Abstract). Instead,
these results indicate, with 100% BS in most analyses, that
the first split within angiosperm evolution occurred
between monocots and dicots. Goremykin et al. [19]
imply that the earlier studies are in error with respect to
the placement of Amborella because these "studies were
based on a limited number of characters derived from
only a few genes" and used "unmasked sequences of chloroplast genes [i.e., with all three codon positions
included] with high substitution rates at their synonymous sites" (p. 1503).
Thus, we are faced with a major paradox. On the one
hand, many different studies, employing in aggregate 28

A correct understanding of relationships among the "earliest" lineages of angiosperms is important if we wish to
elucidate the causes and consequences of their origin, to
understand patterns and tempos of character evolution in
the earliest lineages, and to decipher subsequent patterns
of diversification. [We sometimes use "earliest", "deepest", "basal", etc. as a convenient shorthand to refer to
plants hypothesized to belong to lineages that result from
the first or one of the first evolutionary branchings within
angiosperm evolution. We do not mean to imply that any
extant plants (e.g., Amborella) are themselves the "earliest"
angiosperms, but rather that they belong to the lineage of
angiosperms that resulted from the first evolutionary split
in angiosperm evolution. When the term "sister" is used
to refer to a phylogenetic placement it refers to the sister
group to the rest of the angiosperms unless otherwise
specified.] A breakthrough in the seemingly intractable
problem of identifying the earliest lineages of
angiosperms occurred in 1999 and 2000, when each of
many multigene studies identified the same three groups
as the earliest branching angiosperms [1-9]. Most of these
studies, as well as most subsequent analyses [10-17] have
converged on the placement of the monotypic genus
Amborella, a vessel-less shrub with unisexual flowers
endemic to New Caledonia, as the sister-group to all living
angiosperms (Fig. 1, Table 1), with the next two divergences within angiosperms corresponding to the water lilies (Nymphaeaceae) and then the Austrobaileyales. This
grade leads toward the well-supported remainder of the
flowering plants, also known as core angiosperms [18]
(Fig. 1). The monophyly of each of the five lineages of
core angiosperms is well established, but relationships
among them are unclear (Fig. 1).

Current consensus hypothesis of angiosperm relationships. Tree topology is based on [42, 91] and references in Table 1. Small asterisks indicate the general
phylogenetic position of the ten angiosperms (generic names
shown for all but the three grasses) examined by Goremykin
et al. [19]. The large asterisk indicates the addition in this
study of the early-arising monocot Acorus to the Goremykin
et al. [19] dataset. The height of the triangles reflects the relative number of species in eudicots (~175,000 species),
monocots (~70,000), and magnoliids (~9,000) as estimated
by Judd et al. [18] and Walter Judd (personal communication). The other five angiosperm groups shown contain only
between 1 and ~100 species.

different genes (19 chloroplast, five mitochondrial, and
four nuclear; Table 1), consistently and strongly place the
branch leading to Amborella deeper in angiosperm evolution than the branch leading to the monocots, whereas a
study that employed twice as many genes found the opposite result, also with strong support. It is critical to resolve
this paradox, for the groups and issues involved are such
important ones in angiosperm phylogeny.

gn/a – not applicable. This study found Amborella+Nymphaea as sister to all other angiosperms (see Discussion).

One notable difference between the two sets of studies
concerns taxon sampling, which can be critical in phylogenetic analysis [20-24]. Even though sampling strategies
in the Amborella-deep studies listed in Table 1 varied substantially, ranging from 18 to 553 species of angiosperms
and from 2,208 to 14,244 nucleotides (NT) of aligned
data, a commonality was their relatively broad taxon sampling. Most of these studies attempted to represent the
diversity of living angiosperms by including critical species identified by prior morphological [25-28] and singlegene molecular analyses [29-31]. Even the listed study
with the fewest taxa [9] was based on exemplar species,
compiled by the Green Plant Phylogeny Research Coordination Group and chosen to represent most of the major
putatively basal lineages suggested by a large body of
previously accumulated results. In contrast, the Goremykin et al. [19] study included only 10 angiosperms.
Five of these belong to a single derived group (eudicots)
and three are grasses (the only monocots sampled), leaving Amborella and Calycanthus (the only sampled member
of the other three lineages of core angiosperms) as the
other two angiosperms sampled (Fig. 1). It is known that
grasses have accelerated substitution rates in all three
genomes [9,32-35], especially the chloroplast genome,
making them a poor representative for such a large and
diverse group as monocots.
Relevant here is that the grasses-sister topology obtained
by Goremykin et al. [19] (see their Fig. 3, which also corresponds to our Fig. 3A) shows one long branch, leading

to grasses, connecting to another long branch, separating
angiosperms from the outgroups. When the outgroups are
removed and the Goremykin et al. [19] tree is taken as an
unrooted network, it becomes apparent that there is no
difference between their ingroup topology and those of
studies that obtained the Amborella-sister rooting. In other
words, given the taxonomic sampling of Goremykin et al.
[19], their grasses-sister topology differs from the canonical Amborella-sister topology only with respect to where
the outgroup branch attaches [36], either to grasses or to
Amborella (see Discussion and Fig. 8 for an elaboration of
this point).
These observations led us to suspect that the grasses-sister
topology is an artifact stemming from long branch attraction (LBA), a phenomenon known [37-39] to give
strongly supported, but spurious results under precisely
the set of conditions operative in the Goremykin et al.
[19] study. These are 1) inadequate taxon sampling, 2)
large amounts of data per taxon, 3) two known long
branches (the grass branch and the outgroup branch) separated by short internodes, and 4) phylogenetic analyses
that do not account for rate heterogeneity.
The current study was undertaken to test whether the
grasses-sister topology is indeed an LBA artifact. We
hypothesize that, by analyzing the Goremykin et al. [19]
dataset with a focus on rate heterogeneity and taxon sampling of monocots, the Amborella-sister topology will be
recovered instead. In addition, we carried out a similar,

but much more limited set of analyses in response to a follow-up paper by Goremykin et al. [40] that appeared
while this manuscript was in the final stages of preparation and which similarly challenged the position of Nymphaea as a basal angiosperm.

Results
Addition of Acorus
We gathered new sequence data for an additional monocot representative, Acorus, and added it to the 13 taxa, 61
gene first- and second-position alignment matrix of Goremykin et al. [19] to give a 14 taxa, 61 gene first- and second-position alignment matrix. Acorus was chosen for two
reasons. First, it is well supported as the sister to all other
monocots [41-43]. Thus, Acorus plus grasses represent
monocot diversity about as well as any two groups of
monocots. Second, unlike grasses, its chloroplast genome
does not appear to have evolved at unusually high rates
[9,44]. The Acorus dataset consisted of 40 protein gene
sequences, 22 newly determined in this study and 18 from
preexisting databases. This corresponds to 65.6% (40/61)
of the genes and 71.4% (32,072/44,937) of the nucleotide characters analyzed by Goremykin et al. [19].

A number of initial analyses were conducted in parallel on
the "full" Acorus matrix, containing data for all 61 genes
and including gaps where data for Acorus were not available, and a "truncated" matrix, containing only those 40
genes where Acorus sequences were available. Inspection
of the resulting trees revealed no topological incongruences and no significant change in bootstrap support (BS)
between the full and truncated analyses [see Additional
files 1 and 2]. The results presented hereafter for Acorus are
based on the full matrix dataset. This allows us to include
all available relevant data, allowing the fullest and most
direct comparisons to the Goremykin et al. [19] analyses.
Representative results of either adding Acorus to the Goremykin et al. [19] matrix or substituting it for grasses are
shown in Fig. 2. Using Acorus instead of grasses to represent monocots has a major effect on the results. This is
especially dramatic for equal-weighted maximum parsimony (MP) analyses of both nucleotides and amino
acids, where there is a shift from 100% BS for monocotssister when only grasses are used to represent monocots
(Figs. 2A and 2D) to 100% and 93% support for Amborella-sister when Acorus is used instead (Figs. 2B and 2E).
The same topological shift is seen with maximum likelihood (ML) using equal rates across sites (cf. Figs. 2G and
2H), although the swing in BS values is less pronounced
(61% for grasses-sister vs. 100% for Amborella-sister).
Transversion parsimony (RY-coding) of the original dataset (Fig. 2J) gives the Amborella-sister topology, but with
poor support (56%). Substituting Acorus for grasses

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/35

improves the support for Amborella-sister to 100% (Fig.
2K).
Inclusion of both grasses and Acorus produced two very
different topologies, depending on the method used. On
the one hand, standard MP, with both nucleotides (Fig.
2C) and amino acids (Fig. 2F), gives a grasses-sister
topology in which monocots are paraphyletic with 100%
BS (i.e., there is 100% support for Acorus as the sister to
"dicots" to the exclusion of grasses). On the other hand,
equal-rates ML (Fig. 2I) and transversion parsimony (Fig.
2L) give an Amborella-sister topology, with moderate
(79%) to strong (98%) support, in which monocots are
monophyletic with equivalent support.
To make the results more directly comparable to the Goremykin et al. study [19] and to investigate the performance
of various distance-based models, we tested many different neighbor joining (NJ) models. We did this also
because, of all MP, ML and NJ methods initially investigated, the only approaches that failed to give the Amborella-sister topology when Acorus was substituted for grasses
were the NJ methods without a ML model. When the
PAUP* [45] distance is set to any of 12 settings (Mean, P,
JC [46], F81 [47], TajNei [48], K2P [49], F84 [50], HKY85
[51], K3P [52], TamNei [53], GTR [54,55] or LogDet
[56,57]), Amborella, Calycanthus, and Acorus form a monophyletic group with 100% BS. Importantly, however, this
same grouping is obtained, with all 12 distance settings,
even when grasses are included, such that, as in equalweighted parsimony analyses (Figs. 2C and 2F), grasses
are sister to all other angiosperms and monocots are not
monophyletic (Fig. 3C and analyses not shown).
Finally, it should be noted that ML and NJ methods using
models (see next section) that give Amborella-sister when
only grasses represent monocots, continue to do so, but
with higher BS, when Acorus is added, either with or without grasses [see Additional files 1 and 2].
Site-to-site rate heterogeneity
If the lineage leading to Amborella is sister to the rest of
angiosperms, as the analyses with Acorus strongly indicate,
why do so many of the Goremykin et al. [19] analyses support the grasses-sister topology? We explored this question by conducting analyses using a broad range of
models and methods as applied to their data matrix (i.e.,
with only grasses representing monocots).

We first compared the relative likelihood of the grassessister and Amborella-sister topologies using ML with all 56
combinations of the 14 substitution models and four rateheterogeneity conditions specified by the MODELBLOCK
script provided by MODELTEST [58]. The four rate-heterogeneity conditions are 1) equal rates across sites, 2) esti-

categories; and 4) "+I+G" = combination of invariant sites and 4
gamma-rate categories.

mated percentage of invariant sites, 3) four gammadistributed rate categories and 4) a combination of invariant sites and gamma-rate categories. With equal rates
across sites, the grasses-sister topology received the higher
likelihood for all 14 substitution models (Table 2). For
the least complex, Jukes-Cantor [46] model (a single substitution rate with equal base frequencies), all four rate-

heterogeneity conditions preferred the grasses-sister
topology. In a more complex model (F81), which uses
estimated base frequencies, the Amborella-sister topology
was preferred when either invariant sites or gamma rate
categories were used but not when they were used in combination. For the other 12 models, the Amborella-sister
topology was preferred for all three conditions that
allowed for rate heterogeneity across sites (Table 2).
These results held when the parameters estimated on one
topology (either Amborella- or grasses- sister) were used to
calculate the likelihood of the other topology (the topology used had only a minor effect on the values of the
parameter estimates). For both topologies, the model chosen by MODELTEST using either the hierarchical
likelihood ratio tests or the Akaike information criterion
was the 5-substitution-type-transversion (TVM) + I + G
model, where the probability of going between A and G is
equal to that of C and T. With this model, using parameter
estimates from either topology, a heuristic search found
the Amborella-sister topology with 98% BS, and the SHtest [59] showed the grasses-sister topology to be significantly worse at the 5% level (p = 0.04).
These MODELTEST analyses identified site-to-site rate
heterogeneity, accounted for using either gamma-distributed rates or invariant sites, as a critical analytical parameter. We therefore explored this in greater detail using one
particular substitution model, the HKY85 model [51]. We
chose the moderately complex and commonly used
HKY85 substitution model with empirical base frequen-

cies over the TVM model to help speed up the calculation
of bootstrap replicates. A ML-HKY85 analysis with equal
rates and an estimated transition:transversion (Ti/Tv)
ratio of 1.485 gives the same, grasses-sister topology (Fig.
4A) as found by Goremykin et al. [19] (see Fig. 2G, which
is equivalent topologically to their Fig. 3), albeit with low
BS (61%) for grasses-sister. In contrast, a tree built using
four rate categories, with the gamma shape parameter (α
= 0.31) estimated from the Goremykin et al. [19] matrix
and topology, gives 96% BS for Amborella-sister (Fig. 4B).
Although we present here only the commonly used, fourrate-category model, a two-rate-category model gives the
same qualitative results in all cases analyzed [see Additional file 3].
To assess the stability of the topology to changes in the α
parameter, we scanned the range α = [0.01–20.0], with the
number of rate categories fixed at four. The same, Amborella-sister topology obtained using the estimated α (0.31)
was also recovered over a wide range of α values (α =
0.01–9.0; Fig. 5A). The BS for Amborella-sister and the SHtest p-value [59] of the Amborella-sister over the grassessister topology both improve as α decreases to the estimated value and continue to improve as α approaches
zero (Fig. 5A). As α approaches infinity, the rate categories
approach the same value (i.e., equal rates) [60]. Accordingly, the BS and p-value curves in Fig. 5 approach the values of the equal-rates trees.
We performed a similar analysis with the proportion of
invariant sites (Plnvar option in PAUP). Using the estimated PInvar = 0.58 without gamma-distributed rate categories, we obtained the Amborella-sister topology (Fig.
4C) with 97% BS. As with α, the Amborella-sister topology
was stable over a wide range of PInvar [0.09 <= PInvar <=
0.995 (Fig. 5B)]. The BS and the SH-test p-value for
Amborella-sister improve as PInvar increases (Fig. 5B). The
SH-test for Amborella-sister is significant at the 5% level
using the estimated value of PInvar and remains significant as PInvar increases.
The BS for a sister-group relationship of Amborella and
Calycanthus is identical (within the variance expected for
BS values) with that for grasses-sister across the entire
range of both α and PInvar values, while both of these BS
values always equal 100 minus the BS value for Amborellasister (Figs. 5A and 5B). This is exactly as expected (see
Discussion) if the only difference between the grasses-sister/Amborella+Calycanthus topology and the Amborella-sister topology is where the outgroup branch roots within
angiosperms. Put another way, almost all of the BS replicates were one of these two topologies.
There are 20,071 (out of 30,017; 66.9%) constant sites in
theGoremykin et al. [19] matrix. When these constant

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/35

sites are removed, the highest HKY85 ML tree (using equal
rates) places Amborella-sister with 98% BS and with p =
0.03 for the SH-test relative to grasses-sister [see Additional file 4, Fig. A]. Furthermore, NJ analysis with the
equal-rate ML model also obtains Amborella-sister (with
100% BS) when constant sites are removed [see Additional file 4, Fig. B]. This is another way of allowing the
rates to increase since the rates of the sites that are changing are not constrained by the constant sites. This allows
the ML model to work with a more homogenous set of
rates and reduces the need for using rate categories.
Removing these constant sites allows the ML model to
simulate the actual evolutionary process of sites that are
changing more accurately than when imposing a proportion of invariant sites because there is no invariant site
weighting of the sites that are changing. As a consequence
of the faster rate with constant sites excluded, the branch
lengths of the resulting trees are ~2.6 times longer than
when constant sites are included.
We further explored the NJ method using ML models of
evolution to compute distances and with constant sites
included. We were able to precisely reproduce the grassessister result (Fig. 3 from Goremykin et al. [19]) with NJ
and the K2P model(Fig. 3A). NJ using a distance matrix
calculated based on ML and using parameters estimated
with the HKY85 model with equal rates alsogives grassessister with 100% BS. However, distances calculated using
the ML HKY85 model and estimated proportion of invariant sites puts Amborella-sister with low BS of 58% [see
Additional file 5], while distances derived from the ML
HKY85 model with four gamma-distributed rate categories estimated gives Amborella-sister with stronger support
(89%; Fig. 3B).
Third codon positions
In order to most directly assess the Goremykin et al. [19]
analyses, which used only first and second codon position, the above analyses were restricted to first and second
codon positions. In addition, however, most of the above
analyses were also carried out with a dataset that includes
all three codon positions. The resulting trees provide similar if not higher support for Amborella-sister than those
obtained with just first and second positions. For example, using all three positions, the gamma rates ML tree
analogous to Fig. 4B gives 100% BS for Amborella-sister,
and the ML distance based NJ tree analogous to Fig. 3B
gives 99% BS for Amborella-sister (trees available upon
request). The most noteworthy shift towards stronger
support involves ML analysis with equal rates, where
inclusion of third positions changes the topology, from
grasses-sister (with 61% BS; Fig. 4A) to Amborella-sister
(and with 100% support; Fig. 4D). We also conducted a
few analyses of third positions only (again using the set of
taxa analyzed by Goremykin et al. [19]). These too recov-

ered Amborella-sister, with 100% BS using ML with either
equal rates or gamma-distributed rates [see Additional file
6].
Individual gene analyses
By taking rate heterogeneity into account or improving
taxon sampling, we have shown that the concatenated
genes dataset supports the Amborella-sister hypothesis,
strongly so in most analyses. To explore the effects of phylogenetic methods and taxon sampling on individual
gene analyses, we analyzed each of the 61 genes in the
Goremykin et al. [19] dataset individually (Fig. 6). These
much smaller subsets of data are, as expected, more
sensitive than the concatenated dataset to the model of
DNA evolution, taxon sampling, and inclusion/exclusion
of third positions. Without appropriately taking these factors into account some genes give topologies that conflict
with the current consensus view of plant phylogeny. With
all three positions and using ML with four gamma-distributed rate categories, the highest likelihood tree in 29 of 61
genes is the Amborella-sister topology and only five genes
give grasses-sister (Fig. 6A). The highest scoring trees for
the remaining genes (most of which are short) place a
wide variety of groups as sister, in nearly all cases with low
BS (data not shown). Bootstrap support values and the
number of trees having Amborella sister increase with gene
length (Fig. 6A). When MP is used on the same datasets
the opposite pattern is observed. Here, the grasses are sister in 27 of 61 trees, whereas Amborella is sister with only
12 genes (Fig. 6B). Excluding third positions results in the
same trend in terms of MP versus ML, but the support values are much lower and the number of highly unlikely
topologies is much higher (see Additional file 7).

The single gene trees also illustrate the effect of taxon sampling. When Acorus is added and all three positions are
used in ML analyses with four rate categories, none of the
gene trees find monocots sister, whereas exactly half of the
40 genes put Amborella sister [see Additional file 8, top figure]. When the third position is excluded, 12 genes put
Amborella sister and BS levels drop significantly, while still
no genes put monocots sister [see Additional file 8, bottom figure]. Very similar results are obtained when the
grasses are removed [see Additional file 9]. In contrast to
the parsimony results without Acorus (where grasses-sister
is the favored topology; Fig. 6B), when Acorus is added
and parsimony is used (with all three positions), only two
genes put monocots sister (and both with low, 13 and
34%, BS), whereas 11 of 40 genes put Amborella sister [see
Additional file 10, top figure]. With Acorus added and
grasses removed, 21 genes place Amborella sister and 1
places Acorus sister [see Additional file 10, bottom figure].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/35

Addition of Nymphaea
While this manuscript was in the final stages of preparation, the chloroplast genome sequence of Nymphaea alba
became available (released to EMBL database on July 13,
2004). This sequence was generated as part of a very recent
study, also by Goremykin et al. [40], in which it was
added, as the only new sequence, to the same data matrix
as analyzed in their earlier study [19] and subjected to a
similar set of phylogenetic analyses. Under these conditions, the grasses-sister topology was again recovered (and
with 100% support) in nearly all analyses, with Nymphaea
and Amborella recovered as sister taxa (also with 100%
support). In their abstract, Goremykin et al. [40] present
these findings as supporting their prior conclusion [19]
that monocots are sister to the rest of angiosperms. However, their Discussion presents a more nuanced treatment
than before, concluding that "we may be some ways from
being confident of identifying the most basal
angiosperms. Clearly the sequencing of genomes for more
closely related outgroups and putatively basal
angiosperms will be important for overcoming potential
problems of model misspecification and long-branch
attraction."

We carried out a limited set of analyses of the 14-taxa
Goremykin et al. [40] data matrix. We did so because of
time constraints and because it became immediately clear
from our relatively few analyses with Nymphaea that our
main results and conclusions were entirely unchanged by
its inclusion/exclusion. Using the Goremykin et al. [40]
methods, we also recovered the same, grasses-sister trees
they reported (data not shown). However, when using
analytical conditions described in the preceding sections,
we never found grasses-sister (Fig. 7). Instead, grasses were
grouped with the other core angiosperms with strong BS
(86–100%). Interestingly, contrary to most published
studies (see Background and Table 1), Amborella alone did
not emerge as sister to all other angiosperms in any of
these analyses. Most commonly (Figs. 7B,7C,7D), Amborella and Nymphaea together comprised the sister lineage to
other angiosperms (with 66–100% BS), whereas an equalrates ML analysis found Nymphaea deepest (albeit with
low, 47% BS) and Amborella next deepest (Fig. 7A).

Discussion
The grasses-sister topology is an LBA artifact
That long branch attraction can be a serious problem in
phylogenetic inference has long been known to the systematics community, ever since this phenomenon was
first explored by Felsenstein [37]. Felsenstein described
conditions of unequal evolutionary rates under which
phylogenetic inference will result not only in an incorrect
topology, but will converge asymptotically to the wrong
phylogeny with increasing confidence as more data are
added, ultimately producing 100% support for the wrong

Competing hypotheses for the rooting of angiosperms showing the same underlying angiosperm topology
when outgroups are excluded. A. Rooting within monocots (Mono), on the branch between grasses and all other
angiosperms (see Fig. 2C, whose BS values are shown here, and also Fig. 2F; also see Goremykin et al. [19]). B. Unrooted network, with arrow showing alternative rootings as in A and C. C. Canonical rooting on the branch between Amborella and the
rest of angiosperms (see Fig. 2I, whose BS values are shown here, and also Fig. 2L). We emphasize that 100% BS was obtained
for Amborella-sister and for monocot monophyly (compared to 79% and 78% in C) using ML methods that allow for site-to-site
rate heterogeneity (e.g., Additional files 1–3).

tree (hence, be positively misleading). Hendy and Penny
[39] showed that this phenomenon can occur for parsimony even under equal evolutionary rates if taxa are
insufficiently sampled along a branch, while Lockhart et
al. [61] showed that an ML equal-rates model can incorrectly join long branches when there is rate heterogeneity
across sites. In the case of DNA sequence data, due to the
limited number of character states, taxa with the greatest
sequence divergence are expected to be "attracted" to each
other by chance alone if long and short branches are sufficiently different in length. With large amounts of data,
this can result in spurious, yet strongly supported,
relationships.
We used two complementary approaches to test the
hypothesis that the grasses-sister topology favored in the
study of Goremykin et al. [19] is caused by spurious
attraction of the long branches leading to angiosperms
and to grasses. Both approaches were designed to make
the most direct comparisons possible to their dataset and
phylogenetic methodology. First, and most importantly,
we found that – even in the absence of corrections for rate
heterogeneity – addition of just one more monocot to
their dataset produced trees strongly supportive of 1) the
Amborella-sister topology and 2) the idea that the grassessister topology is a consequence of LBA causing a misrooting of angiosperms. When the monocot Acorus was
directly substituted for grasses, strong support for Amborella-sister was obtained (Fig. 2). This even occurred under

analytical conditions that give strong support for grassessister when Acorus is not included. When Acorus and
grasses were both included, two alternative, seemingly
radically
different
topologies
were
obtained.
Reconciliation of these topologies gets to the heart of the
phylogenetic issues at hand. For as Fig. 8 shows, these two
topologies are actually entirely congruent with respect to
relationships among the various angiosperms, differing
only in where the outgroup branch attaches within
angiosperms [62], i.e., on the branches leading either to
Amborella or to grasses (also see Fig. 5 and its treatment in
Results).
The Amborella-sister topology is in agreement with the
many diverse phylogenetic studies summarized in Table 1
and in Background, except for that of Goremykin et al.
[19]. With Acorus included (Figs. 2I and 2L), it also shows
monocots as monophyletic, consistent with a large body
of evidence [7,35,41-43,63], and depicts faster chloroplast
DNA evolution on the monocot lineage leading to grasses
than in the Acorus lineage, also consistent with a substantial body of evidence (e.g. [9,44]). Conversely, the grassessister topology (Figs. 2C and 2F) is consistent only with
the Goremykin et al. [19] results, fails to recover monophyly of monocots [has them either paraphyletic (Figs. 2C
and 2F) or even polyphyletic (Fig. 3C), and always with
100% support], and fails to portray the known rapid evolution of chloroplast DNA in the lineages leading to
grasses. All this leads us to conclude that the grasses-sister

Page 13 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2004, 4:35

topology is almost certainly an artifact, most likely due to
LBA between the long branches leading to grasses and to
angiosperms.
Second, we reanalyzed the same dataset used by Goremykin et al. [19] and found that methods that account for
rate heterogeneity across sites [61,64-67] put Amborella
sister, usually with high BS (Figs. 2J, 3B, 4B, 4C, and 5;
also see most Additional files). This was true for all 14
MODELTEST substitution models (Table 2) except for the
simplest, JC model. When rates vary between sites, as with
the chloroplast dataset under consideration, it is usually
appropriate to model the evolutionary process to reflect
this. The evolutionary models explored here point to LBA
as the cause of the controversial grasses-sister topology
and demonstrate that even with conservative corrections
for rate heterogeneity, Amborella moves to the sister position within angiosperms (e.g., Figs. 5A and 5B).
In summary, our two principal approaches for reassessing
the results and analyses of Goremykin et al. [19] lead to
what we regard as compelling evidence for two major conclusions. First, Amborella, not grasses, is the sister
angiosperm among this set of taxa. Second, any tendency
for angiosperms to root on grasses is an LBA artifact stemming from the confluence of limited taxon sampling,
rapid evolution in grasses, a long branch between the outgroups and angiosperms, and rate heterogeneity across
sites. Furthermore, we point out that while our manuscript was nearly finished, two independent papers
appeared [68,69] that also challenged Goremykin et al.
[19] and reached similar conclusions to our study. Both
studies are complementary to ours, because instead of taking the Goremykin et al. [19] 61-gene chloroplast dataset
as the starting point, as we did, they used a 3-gene dataset
(the same two chloroplast genes and one nuclear gene)
plus the Goremykin et al. [19] set of taxa as the starting
point for a variety of taxon-sampling experiments. In
addition, an important forthcoming study [70] which
added five new chloroplast genome sequences to the dataset of Goremykin et al. [19], found "strong support" for
the Amborella-sister topology. That four entirely independent studies, using a variety of taxon sets, character
sets, and analytical approaches, all lead to such similar
results and conclusions makes it all the more likely that
the grasses-sister topology is indeed a phylogenetic
artifact.
Is Amborella or Amborella+Nymphaeaceae sister to the
rest of angiosperms?
Although our results reject grasses/monocots as the sister
to all other angiosperms, support for Amborella as the first
branch of angiosperm evolution must necessarily be qualified given the very limited sampling of whole chloroplast
genomes (besides Amborella, only monocots, Calycanthus,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/35

and eudicots; see Fig. 1). There is still uncertainty as to the
exact placement of Amborella relative to the other two
deepest lineages of angiosperms, especially Nymphaeaceae [8,9], although the overall weight of published evidence currently favors Amborella as the deepest
angiosperm (see [10,12] and references in Table 1). This
uncertainty is heightened by our limited analyses that
included Nymphaea and used methods that account for
rate heterogeneity. These analyses never recovered an
Amborella-sister topology. Instead, they most commonly
found a sister clade comprising both Amborella and Nymphaea (Figs. 7B,7C,7D), or even found Nymphaea alone to
be the sister-most angiosperm (Fig. 7A). Likewise, in the
one analysis reported by Goremykin et al. [40] in which
Amborella and Nymphaea were found sister to the other
angiosperms these two taxa clustered as sisters rather than
forming a basal grade.
Clearly, then, the question of which group is sister to the
rest of extant angiosperms should be regarded as unsettled
and in need of further exploration, using much more data
(such as whole chloroplast genomes from a large number
of diverse angiosperms, as well as more mitochondrial
and/or nuclear data) and better analytical methodologies
as they become available. At the same time, we must face
up to two serious limitations arising from extinction. First,
Amborella trichopoda is the only known species in the
entire Amborellaceae/Amborellales, i.e., it is the only
taxon available whose DNA can be used to represent a lineage of ca. 150 million years in age arising at or near the
base of angiosperms. Second, the stem branch leading to
angiosperms is long in length and years [9,62] (also
approaching 150 million years) and thus represents a
long-branch attractor, with the potential to spuriously
attract other branches besides that leading to grasses. LBA
between outgroup and ingroups is particularly insidious,
because, as illustrated in Fig. 2 (C and F vs. I and L), it
tends to mask the long nature of the ingroup branches.
Amborella does not show any evidence of having a long
branch in published analyses with more extensive taxon
sampling. It is nonetheless difficult to rule out (but see
[10]) the possibility that Amborella may be only near-sister
among angiosperms (e.g., part of a Nymphaeaceae/
Amborella clade that itself is the earliest branch of
angiosperms; as suggested by Barkman et al. [8] and some
of our analyses), with its generally sister position representing only a slight topological distortion (nearest neighbor interchange) caused by attraction to the long
outgroup branch. For that matter, we point out (also see
[71]) that the long branch leading to angiosperms also
makes it difficult to rule out the possibility that the monophyletic-gymnosperm topologies recovered by multigene
analyses (e.g., [35,72-74]) might result from LBA between
angiosperms and the outgroup branch leading to seed
plants.

General implications
Many of our analyses, including all but one of the 61-gene
concatenate analyses shown, included only first and
second codon positions. This is because Goremykin et al.
[19] chose to exclude third codon positions from their
analyses, and because we wanted to make the most direct
comparisons possible to their analyses. Third positions
were excluded because most of the 61 chloroplast genes
were claimed to be "very divergent" at synonymous sites
(Ks for most genes between Pinus and angiosperms was
between 0.50 and 1.50 substitutions/site), which they felt
could lead to "misleading" phylogenetic results. However,
because our analyses with all three positions or only third
positions gave such similar results to those using only first
and second positions, we believe that for this particular
dataset third positions are not contributing "excessive"
homoplasy and leading to spurious affiliations. This
conclusion is consistent with a considerable body of literature dealing with the phylogenetic utility of third positions in organellar genes [75-80], while simulations have
shown that "saturated" data can be very reliable, provided
that taxon sampling is sufficiently high [21,24]. Caution
is nonetheless well advised in situations involving relatively sparse taxon sampling (some of which may be unavoidable, i.e., where extinction has been significant) and/
or greater divergences than in this study. For example,
chloroplast third positions are problematic in analyses
across all of algal/plant evolution (e.g., [81]), and even
appear to be problematic at the relatively shallow level of
seed plant phylogeny [35,73,82].

Our findings, and those of others [68-70,83], highlight
the potential danger of phylogenetic analyses that employ
lots of genes, but too few and/or the wrong taxa. Adequate
taxon sampling is in a sense even more important here
than with single or few-gene trees, because of the potential
for even subtle systematic bias in a particular lineage's
evolution to generate strongly supported misleading trees.
Equally, if not more importantly, our results emphasize
the crucial importance of using phylogenetic methods
that best model the underlying molecular evolutionary
processes, especially by accounting for site-to-site rate
variation.

Methods
Sequencing chloroplast genes from Acorus
We used long PCR to generate full-length or partial
sequences from Acorus gramineus Soland. (a voucher specimen is deposited at the IND herbarium) for 22 of the 61
chloroplast genes analyzed by Goremykin et al. [19]. Long
PCRs were conducted using the AccuTaq™ LA DNA
Polymerase (Sigma, Atlanta, GA, USA), following instructions provided by the manufacturer. Initially, sets of primers designed by Graham and Olmstead [9], which cover a
large portion of the chloroplast genome (psbC-D and psbE-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/35

J operons; from rpl2 to 3'-rps12 gene), as well as the primers described in [84-87] for the rbcL, atpB, trnL-F, and trnED region, respectively, were used for amplifications and/
or sequencing. For the most part, however, based on the
initial sequences, a number of sequencing primers were
designed and used for chromosome walking with long
PCR products. Primer sequences are available upon
request from SS. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis using 0.8% agarose gels, visualized with ethidium-bromide, and cleaned using Qiagen columns
(Valencia, CA, USA). Cleaned products were then directly
sequenced using the BigDye™ Terminator cycle sequencing kit (PE Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA) on
an ABI 3100 DNA automated sequencer (PE Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequence data were edited
and assembled using Sequencher™ 4.1 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The Acorus sequences for
these 22 chloroplast genes (atpA, atpE, clpP, cemA, lhbA, 3'petB, petD, petG, petL, psaB, psaI, rpl20, rpoA, rpoB, rpoC1,
rpoC2, rps2, rps14, rps18, rps19, ycf3, ycf4) are deposited in
GenBank (accession numbers AY757810-AY757831).
These were combined for phylogenetic analyses with fulllength or partial Acorus sequences already available in
GenBank for 18 other chloroplast genes [AF123843 (psbB,
psbT, psbN, psbH), AF123771 (rps7, 3'-rps12), AF123828
(psbE, psbF, psbL), AF123813 (psbD, psbC), AF123785
(rpl2), D28866 (rbcL), X84107 (rps4), U96631 (psbA),
AB040155 (matK), AF197616 (atpB), and AJ344261
(psaA)]. The 40 Acorus genes used here come from two
closely related species – A. calamus (14 genes) and A.
gramineus (26 genes) – and correspond to 65.6% (40/61)
of the genes and 71.4% (32,072/44,937) of the nucleotide characters analyzed by Goremykin et al. [19].
Alignment
For all first and second codon position analyses, the data
matrix provided by V. Goremykin was used without modification. For analyses that included Acorus, the Acorus
genes were individually aligned with the individually
extracted gene alignments from the Goremykin et al. [19]
dataset using CLUSTALW [88], and the resulting gene
alignments were concatenated to regenerate a matrix identical to the original except for the extra row containing
Acorus. Using the same procedure, Acorus was also added
to the amino acid matrix provided by V. Goremykin. The
relevant 61 chloroplast genes of Nymphaea [40] were likewise added to both alignments.

We also constructed a new matrix consisting of all three
codon positions by extracting genes from 13 sequenced
chloroplast genomes of land plants (GenBank numbers:
AP002983, AP000423, AJ271079, Z00044, AJ400848,
AJ506156, AJ428413, X86563, AB042240, X15901,
D17510, AP004638, X04465), aligning them, and hand
editing apparent mistakes. The first and second position

version of this matrix was nearly identical to the Goremykin et al. [19] matrix, except for a few minor differences
(the overall length was slightly shorter due to removal of
terminal extensions that either were created by single
taxon indels or where multiple extending genes were nonhomologous). All phylogenetic trees resulting from this
first and second position matrix and the Goremykin et al.
[19] matrix were identical in topology and nearly identical
in BS values. All alignments used in this study are available in Nexus format upon request of DWR.
Phylogenetic analyses
Phylogenetic analyses were performed in PAUP* 4.0b10
[45]. Unless specified, all nucleotide-based trees were
built using only first- and second-codon positions. For ML
analyses, parameters were initially estimated using an
equal-weighted parsimony tree. A ML tree was then built,
and parameters were re-estimated using this tree if it differed from the parsimony tree. This iteration was continued until the last two topologies converged (the final ML
topology was almost always equal to the one in which the
ML parameters were estimated from the parsimony topology). For all ML analyses we also calculated a NJ tree using
distances calculated from the ML model being tested. For
DNA and protein parsimony the default PAUP* 4.0b10
[45] step matrices were used.

Bootstrap support [89] was estimated with 100 replicates
using parameters estimated from the final topology. Thus
the methodology cited for a particular tree refers to the
model used for the bootstrap replicates. For parsimony
and ML searches the heuristic algorithm was used with
simple and as-is stepwise addition, respectively; tree bisection-reconnection swapping; and no limit on the number
of trees saved in memory. Unless specified, the default
PAUP* settings were used in all analyses. An automated
script (available upon request from DWR) was used to run
the analyses. Detailed log files and trees of each analysis
were saved and are available upon request from DWR.
Most analyses were performed on two 3 GHz Linux
machines. Treetool [90] was used for viewing and printing
trees.

Trees from truncated matrix with Acorus. These first- and second-position trees show that the results are essentially the same when positions that
have Acorus data missing are removed. The first row using the ML
HKY85 model is with four rate categories and parameters estimated as
described in Methods. The third row uses the ML model parameters calculated as in the first row to calculate a distance matrix that was used for
NJ analyses. For comparison the corresponding bootstrap values for
Amborella sister to the angiosperms in the full matrix, going across each
row, are 1. (99 vs. 100, 100 vs. 100), 2. (NA but same topology and similar BS, 100 vs. 100), 3. (86 vs. 88, 84 vs. 90).
