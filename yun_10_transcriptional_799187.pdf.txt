Abstract
Background: The transcriptional regulatory network involved in low temperature response leading to acclimation
has been established in Arabidopsis. In japonica rice, which can only withstand transient exposure to milder cold
stress (10°C), an oxidative-mediated network has been proposed to play a key role in configuring early responses
and short-term defenses. The components, hierarchical organization and physiological consequences of this
network were further dissected by a systems-level approach.
Results: Regulatory clusters responding directly to oxidative signals were prominent during the initial 6 to 12
hours at 10°C. Early events mirrored a typical oxidative response based on striking similarities of the transcriptome
to disease, elicitor and wounding induced processes. Targets of oxidative-mediated mechanisms are likely
regulated by several classes of bZIP factors acting on as1/ocs/TGA-like element enriched clusters, ERF factors acting
on GCC-box/JAre-like element enriched clusters and R2R3-MYB factors acting on MYB2-like element enriched
clusters.
Temporal induction of several H2O2-induced bZIP, ERF and MYB genes coincided with the transient H2O2 spikes
within the initial 6 to 12 hours. Oxidative-independent responses involve DREB/CBF, RAP2 and RAV1 factors acting
on DRE/CRT/rav1-like enriched clusters and bZIP factors acting on ABRE-like enriched clusters. Oxidative-mediated
clusters were activated earlier than ABA-mediated clusters.
Conclusion: Genome-wide, physiological and whole-plant level analyses established a holistic view of chilling
stress response mechanism of japonica rice. Early response regulatory network triggered by oxidative signals is
critical for prolonged survival under sub-optimal temperature. Integration of stress and developmental responses
leads to modulated growth and vigor maintenance contributing to a delay of plastic injuries.

Background
Plants in temperate environments are able to withstand
sub-freezing conditions by cold acclimation, whereas
those that are adapted to tropical or sub-tropical environments can only maximally endure milder chilling
temperatures [1]. Arabidopsis has been a particularly
well scrutinized model system for low temperature
stress response mechanisms because of its ability to cold
acclimate [2-4]. Cold acclimation is a manifestation of
the coordinated function of a large number of genes

under the control of few transcriptional regulators that
respond directly to low temperature signals through
abscisic acid (ABA) independent signal transduction
[5,6].
The established resources for functional genomics in
Arabidopsis facilitated a systematic approach for assembling the components of regulatory networks involved
in cold acclimation as well as those involved in similar
types of abiotic stresses [7]. The most well documented
mechanism involves a class of ERF transcription factors
(TF) known as the DREB/CBF, which interact with the
DRE/CRT cis-elements in the promoters of their downstream target genes to execute a highly coordinated
transcriptional response to low temperature signals

[8-10]. The DREB/CBF regulon is a large cluster consisting of more than a hundred genes with associated subregulons controlled by RAP2.1 and RAP2.6 [8,9,11]. Acting upstream is the MYC-type DREB/CBF activator
ICE1, which is regulated by phosphorylation [12]. Discovery of other regulons that function during cold acclimation is a continuing story. Recently, a DREB/CBFindependent regulon controlled by a zinc finger TF
(ZAT12) was discovered [3,8]. ZAT12 acts in parallel to
the CBF/DREB pathway although each mechanism
appears to activate overlapping sets of COR genes. Additional regulatory clusters controlled by RAV1 TF have
also been inferred based on transcriptome profiles of
overexpression lines [3,9].
Rice is another important model for dissecting stress
response regulatory networks because of its ‘finished’
genome sequence and rapidly developing functional
genomics resources. Unlike the freeze-tolerant Arabidopsis, most rice cultivars are irreversibly injured by
prolonged exposure to temperatures above 10°C (chilling), particularly at early seedling stage. However, many
japonica cultivars are moderately adapted to temperate
climates and they generally exhibit lesser degrees of chilling sensitivity than most tropical indica cultivars. Previous efforts to profile the low temperature
transcriptome of japonica rice was based on the
responses to 4°C [13], which is below the typical seedling stage LT50 of 13°C for even the most chilling tolerant japonica cultivars [14-16]. The scope of
transcriptional changes that occur when japonica rice is
exposed to chilling (10°C) has been investigated only
recently in an effort to establish a more agronomically
meaningful picture of response mechanisms [14,17,18].
In our earlier analysis of about 6,000 genes, we recognized peculiar trends suggesting that transient oxidative
stress during the initial 24 hours triggered an ‘early
response’ regulatory network that seems to play an
important role in short-term adaptive responses [17]. To
dissect the various components of this network and
other aspects that are independent of oxidative signals,
we performed two parallel genome-wide expression profiling experiments comparing the responses of japonica
rice to chilling (10°C) and cold-independent mimic of
oxidative stress.
With the systems level approach employed in this
study, we established a broader picture of the hierarchical organization and compositional complexity of upregulated transcriptional network supported by direct
physiological evidence that oxidative signal caused by
transient increases in intracellular H 2 O 2 is a primary
trigger for network activation. Potential agronomic significance of oxidative-mediated network was established
by integrating different layers of information derived
from genome-wide, physiological and whole-plant level

analyses. The results of this study indicate that expression of early response regulatory network is a critical
determinant of the ability of japonica rice for prolonged
survival under sub-optimal temperature conditions. This
is achieved by integrating defense and growth related
responses leading to the ability to delay the progression
of irreversible stress injuries by maintenance or
enhancement of vigor.

Results and Discussion
Profile of chilling stress response transcriptome of
japonica rice

Two parallel transcript profiling experiments were performed using the NSF-45K oligonucleotide microarray
[19]. In the first experiment (GSE8767), gene expression
in cv. Nipponbare was monitored during a 96-hour
duration at 10°C covering both early (0.5, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18,
24 hours) and late (36, 48, 96 hours) responses. In the
second experiment (GSE10062), gene expression in
response to applied H2O2 (4 mM) after 1, 3 and 6 hours
of treatment at optimum temperature (28°C) was investigated also in cv. Nipponbare. The overall assumption
was that gene activation by oxidative signals and those
triggered by other physiological perturbations can be
inferred by subtracting the composition of one dataset
from the other.
Chilling stress has massive effects on the transcriptome, which is comprised of 8,668 genes that exhibited
temporal changes during a 96-hour duration at 10°C.
The upregulated components were identified by querying the whole microarray dataset at an arbitrary
threshold of log2 ≥ 1.8 (p < 0.05), revealing a total of
2,604 unique genes that were induced within a duration of at least two consecutive time points. Nearly
60% (1,516) of these genes were also induced by 4 mM
H2 O2 (p < 0.05) in at least one time point (Figure 1).
This overlap was assumed to represent the components of chilling stress response transcriptome that
were activated by an oxidative-mediated regulatory
mechanism.
The downregulated dataset does not overlap with the
upregulated dataset. It includes all the genes (total =
6,064) with expression values of log2 ≤ -1.8 (p < 0.05) in
at least one time point and without any value equal to
or greater than the upregulated threshold (log2 1.8) in
any one time point. Of these, 25% (1,516) were also
downregulated by 4 mM H2O2 (Figure 1). These genes
were assumed to represent the components of chilling
stress transcriptome that were negatively regulated by
an oxidative-mediated mechanism. The composition and
temporal profiles of the downregulated group were quite
complex. A summary of the distribution of these genes
according to broad functional categories is presented
(see Additional file 1).

Figure 1 General features of the chilling stress response transcriptome of japonica rice (cv. Nipponbare) based on the analysis of
expression profiles across 10 time points. The composition of the non-overlapping upregulated (2,604 genes) and downregulated (6,064
genes) components are indicated. Venn diagram also shows the overlap between chilling and H2O2 response transcriptomes. For the
upregulated component, 1,088 genes (86 transcription factors + 1,002 non-transcription factors) were induced by chilling but not by exogenous
H2O2 and 1,516 genes (62 transcription factors + 1,454 non-transcription factors) were induced by both chilling and exogenous H2O2. For the
downregulated component, 3,843 genes (266 transcription factors + 3,577 non-transcription factors) were repressed by chilling but not by
exogenous H2O2 and 1,516 genes (82 transcription factors + 2,139 non-transcription factors) were repressed by both chilling and exogenous
H2O2.

Downregulation appears to have major impact on cellular processes related to growth, development and morphogenesis, cell division, metabolism and transport
mechanisms. Due to the complexity of the temporal patterns exhibited by this group of genes, the assembly of
underlying regulatory network and their linkages with
the upregulated network will be described in a separate
report based on the analysis of transcription factor overexpression lines.
Major regulators of chilling stress response transcriptome

Transcription factors (TF) link stress signals to the
downstream genes that execute cellular defense processes [20]. Of the 2,604 chilling upregulated genes,
about 6% (148) are TFs (Figure 1, Table 1), which were
identified based on the classification of the Database of
Rice Transcription Factors [21,22]. These genes represent more than 7% of the total TFs encoded by the rice
genome and include members of AP2/ERF, bZIP, MYB,
WRKY, bHLH and NAC families [3,6,23-26]. TFs exhibited complex expression patterns characterized by waves
of induction initiating at different time periods (Figures
2, 3, 4; see Additional files 2, 3, 4). For instance, activation of the ‘early rapid response’ group (phase-1)
occurred during the initial 6 hours, while those that
belong to the ‘early slow response’ group (phase-2)
occurred between 6 and 24 hours. Few TFs exhibited
‘late response’ profiles (phase-3) with no significant
induction until after 24 hours. Majority of chilling upregulated TFs were activated at phase-1 and phase-2,

indicating that the critical transcriptional changes
occurred during the initial 24 hours.
Induction waves were either short-lived or long-lived
events lasting between 2 to 60 hours. Some genes are
activated multiple times based on interrupted patterns
(Figures 2, 3, 4). Multi-phasic profiles reflect the temporal hierarchy of regulatory networks operating at 10°C
and the complexity of signals that trigger the activity of
regulatory clusters. Apparently, phase-1 TFs are closest
to the original signal and are likely to function as primary switches that trigger subsequent cascade of gene
activation. Reactivation of some phase-1 TFs at later
time points suggests that multiple signals are acting on
the same TF. Phase-2 and phase-3 TFs are likely controlled by other phase-1 TFs that respond directly to the
primary signal. Similar hierarchical organization of stress
related TFs has been shown earlier. For example, DREB/
CBF controls two other types of ERF genes (RAP2.1,
RAP2.6) involved in the activation of DRE/CRT element-containing genes as well as an R2R3-type MYB
that control other potential sub-regulons related to
CBF/DREB network [3,9,27].
bZIP family

Members of the bZIP family of TFs have important
roles in ABA response and regulation of oxidative and
pathogen defense responses [5,28]. A total of 11 genes
from this family were upregulated by chilling (Figure 2),
representing five sub-classes based on recent phylogenetic classification [24,29]. The ‘early response’ (phase-1

and phase-2) genes belong to Group-D associated with
oxidative stress and defenses against pathogens
(Os06g41100: TGA10), Group-H associated with photomorphogenesis (Os02g10860: HY5, Os12g06520:
PosF21), Group-I associated with GA response
(Os08g43090: RF2b-group, Os04g10260: bZIP domain
protein), and Group-S associated with stress response
and sucrose signaling (Os08g38020: AtbZIP148-like) and
a novel gene that appears to be specific to rice
(Os0410260). The ABA-associated bZIP genes belonging
to Group-A (Os02g52780: ABI5, Os01g64000: AREB)
were not induced until after 24 hours (phase-3). Several
Group-D (Os05g37170: TGA6) and Group-S
(Os02g09830, Os02g03960: ocs-binding proteins) genes
were also induced at phase-3. Majority of chilling
induced bZIP genes were also induced by H2O2 (Figure
2). Many (Os06g41100, Os05g37170, Os02g09830,

Os02g03960) are known to interact with as1/ocs/TGAlike elements involved in H2O2, auxin, disease, salicylic
acid and jasmonic acid regulated gene expression
[30-33].
ABA induces H 2 O 2 synthesis in guard cells via
NADPH oxidase [34,35]. This was indicated by impaired
stomatal closure in double mutants for NADPH oxidase
AtrbohD and AtrbohF genes, which was reversed by exogenous H 2 O 2 [36]. ABA-related bZIP genes of rice
(Os02g52780, Os01g64000) were also induced by H2O2
but their late induction implies direct consequences of
ABA rather than oxidative signaling. We observed that
rice seedlings had visible symptoms of leaf rolling not
earlier than 24 hours after exposure to 10°C (data not
shown), which was coincident with the temporal expression of ABA-related bZIP genes at phase-3. This pattern
indicates that oxidative-mediated gene expression

occurred much earlier (within the initial 6 hours) than
those mediated by ABA (after 24 hours), and that ROS
(H 2 O 2 ) was the primary signal that integrates early
responses (Figure 5). This is consistent with our earlier
observations that many chilling induced genes that were
also induced by ABA were ‘late response’ genes [[17],
unpublished data].
AP2/ERF family

About 18% (31) of AP2/ERF genes of rice were induced
by chilling (Table 1; Figure 3). Most are ERF-type
belonging to nine phylogenetic groups [3,5,20,37]. Genes
involved in indole alkaloid metabolism (ORCA-type)
and responses to diseases, wounding and elicitors such
as ethylene, salicylic acid and jasmonic acid comprise
one of the larger classes which include Group-VI/subfamily B-5 (Os06g06540), Group-VIII/subfamily B-1

(Os04g52090, Os06g47590, Os05g41780, Os06g47590,
Os01g58420, Os04g57340), and Group-IX/subfamily B-3
(Os02g43790, Os07g22730, Os08g44960, Os09g39810).
Many are known to interact with GCC-box and jasmonic acid response element (JAre) [38-41]. Genes in this
category were expressed in all three phases but only few
were responsive to H2O2 (Figure 3).
Another large category of chilling-induced ERF represent a class of genes homologous to the low temperature, dehydration and salinity stress regulators in
Arabidopsis belonging to Group-II/subfamily A-5
(RAP2.1/2.9/2.10 group: Os03g15660, Os06g11940),

(Os03g08500, Os03g08490, Os12g40960). Members of

these groups interact with DRE/CRT and related cis-elements [6,42,43]. Only few of these genes were induced
by H2O2, suggesting that this class of ERF is not a direct
target of oxidative signaling although cross-talk is possible as indicated by few DREB/CBF genes that responded
to the H2O2 treatment (Figure 3). Specific DREB/CBF
genes from Group-III were activated at phase-1
(Os02g45450: DREB1A/CBF3, Os08g43210/Os09g35010:
DREB1B/CBF1, Os01g73770: DREB1C/CBF2), phase-2
(Os06g03670:
DREB1A/CBF3)
and
phase-3

(Os09g35020: DREB1D/CBF4), indicating that different
members respond to specific signals at various stages of
stress.
The third category of chilling induced ERF genes are
associated with growth regulation and ABA signaling
from Group-I/subfamily A-6 (Os04g44670, Os06g11860,
Os03g09170), Group-IV/subfamily A-2 (Os05g28350)
and Group-X/subfamily B-4 (Os09g28440) [44,45].
Genes in this category were activated either at phase-1
or phase-2 and many were also induced by H2O2 (Figure

and control plants at each time point ([nmole chilling]/[nmole control]). Peak values at 1.5, 4, 5 and 8.5 hours were significantly greater than 1 at
p < 0.01, n = 3 (SE shown as error bars).

3). Early induction appears to be a consequence of oxidative signaling rather than ABA, given that ABA
response does not seem to occur until after 24 hours
after chilling exposure.
Several non-ERF-type TFs were also induced by chilling,
including the RAV1-type ABI3/VP1 homologs
(Os01g04750, Os01g04800), genes encoding baby boomlike proteins (Os09g25600, Os02g40070) and a novel
ERF3-like gene (Os08g41030) (Figure 3). RAV1-type TFs
function in low temperature response and circadian regulation [5,9], while the baby boom-like proteins are involved
in development [20]. Rice seedlings at three-leaf (V3) stage,
which is about 12 days after germination, were used in the
microarray experiments. Activation of RAV1-type and
baby boom-type transcription factors reflects the crosstalk that typically occurs between low temperature
response and developmental processes and this is probably
important to integrate signals necessary for normal seedling growth and immediate defenses to stress.
Homologs of ERF genes that function maximally during
cold acclimation at 4°C in Arabidopsis were activated at
milder (10°C) temperature [27]. The regulatory clusters
and physiological consequences are likely to be different
under non-acclimating (10°C) and acclimating (4°C) temperature regimes based on the observation that CBF/
DREB induction at 10°C tend to be relatively short-lived
and less robust [11]. Nevertheless, the transcriptional network at 10°C provides an agronomically meaningful view
of response mechanisms since the LT50 for most japonica
cultivars is about 13°C [14,16,46]. ERFs involved in disease response via oxidative, jasmonic acid and salicylic
acid signaling are also involved in chilling stress response.
However, they appear to act on a different set of target
genes from those regulated by DREB/CBF.
MYB family

MYB domain proteins represent the largest class of TFs
involved in cell cycle regulation, cell fate determination
and responses to environmental stresses [47-49]. MYB is

also the largest group of chilling induced TFs with 37
members (Figure 4) belonging to three sub-families [50].
The two largest are the R2R3 subfamily (Os02g41510,
Os01g50110, Os01g18240, Os09g23620, Os05g04820,
Os01g45090, Os09g36730, Os09g26170, Os10g33810,
Os10g35660, Os04g43680, Os11g45740, Os12g37690,
Os09g36730, Os05g46610) and R1-MYB/MYB-like subfamily (Os01g09760, Os10g30719, Os01g09280,
Os05g07010, Os06g07640, Os06g19980, Os05g10690,
Os02g56030, Os02g10060, Os04g40420, Os04g41830,
Os08g04840, Os01g03660, Os02g45670). Many R2R3
genes are known to function in cold, salinity and ABA
response mechanisms [51-53]. A total of 24 MYB genes
were activated at phase-1, 5 at phase-2 and 8 at phase-3
(Figure 4). Phase-1 MYB genes tend to be more responsive to exogenous H 2 O 2 than those in phase-2 and
phase-3, indicating that ‘early response’ genes are possible direct targets of oxidative signals including the
OsMYB4 (Os02g41510) that we previously reported [17].
WRKY family

WRKY TFs function as positive or negative regulators of
defenses against pathogens and herbivores via salicylic
acid and jasmonic acid signaling pathways [54-58].
Their precise role in abiotic stress response regulatory
network is not fully understood [59,60]. A total of 17
members of this family were induced by chilling (see
Additional file 2). Most are ‘early response’ genes, 10 of
which were induced at phase-1 and 5 at phase-2. Phase1 genes include several known regulators of salicylic
acid and jasmonic acid mediated disease response
(Os01g14440: OsWRKY1v2, Os09g24070: OsWRKY62,
Os03g55164: OsWRKY4, Os05g39720: OsWRKY53,
Os11g45850: OsWRKY40, Os05g04640: OsWRKY5), and
few have recently been shown to function in ABAmediated gene expression (Os01g61080: OsWRK24,
Os11g29870: OsWRKY72). OsWRKY24 is particularly
interesting because it was recently shown to act as
repressor of ABA-mediated induction of HVA22 [60,61].

Yun et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:16
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/16

Upregulation of this gene at phase-1 is quite consistent
with our current data showing that ABA-regulated
expression of ABI5 and AREB genes occurred largely at
phase-3. OsWRKY24 appears to act as repressor of
ABA-inducible genes during the early stages of chilling
stress and it is likely involved in the integration of
responses to oxidative and ABA signals.
Phase-2 WRKY genes are mostly disease-related
(Os05g27730; OsWRKY53; Os05g50610: OsWRKY8v2,
Os01g51690: OsWRKY26) and herbivory-related
(Os03g58420: OsWRKY6). Downregulation of
OsWRKY53 by ABA was reported recently [61].
OsWRKY53 expression lasted only up to phase-2 which
is probably due to increased ABA levels at phase-3.
Three of the phase-2 WRKY genes were induced by
H2O2 and they are probably secondary targets of oxidative signaling through other TFs that are induced at
phase-1. Their activation by H2O2 may also be mediated
by salicylic acid or jasmonic acid [62]. It is possible that
some of the phase-1 and phase-2 WRKY genes are
involved in repression of gene expression to fine-tune
the interaction of early (oxidative) and late (ABA) signaling mechanisms. Enrichment of W-box-like motifs
among downregulated genes are consistent with this
hypothesis (data not shown).
bHLH family

TFs from the bHLH family are involved in plant development, morphogenesis, circadian regulation and stress
response [63]. MYC-type factors are involved in ABAregulated gene expression [12,26,37]. About 19% (29) of
rice bHLH genes were induced by chilling, 18 of which
were at phase-1, 5 at phase-2 and 6 at phase-3. Half of
‘early response’ bHLH genes were responsive to exogenous H2O2 and their profiles were characterized by multiple waves reflecting possible roles in combinatorial
control mechanisms (see Additional file 3).
NAC family

NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, CUC2) genes encode a group of
plant-specific TFs involved in growth and hormone signaling, apical meristem and floral development, senescence, disease response via salicylic acid and jasmonic
acid and abiotic stress responses via ABA [23,64,65]. A
total of 23 NAC genes were induced by chilling, including 21 ‘early response’ (14 at phase-1 and 7 at phase-2)
and 2 ‘late response’ (Table 1; see Additional file 4).
Only few of the NAC genes (mostly phase-1 genes)
were also induced by H2O2.
Stress induced H2O2: Temporal coincidence with
transcription factor activation

Cellular concentrations of ROS including H 2 O 2 are
tightly regulated by balancing synthesis and degradation.
Exposure to sub-optimal conditions often disturbs such
balance [66,67]. At a critical level within specific cellular
microdomains, H2O2 acts as secondary messenger that

Page 8 of 29

integrates a variety of responses associated with biotic
and abiotic signals and growth and development
[68-71]. We have shown in our previous report that
exogenous H2O2 mimics to a certain degree the effect
of chilling on gene expression by activating many chilling-associated ROS scavengers and other stress related
genes when plants were treated with 4 mM H 2 O 2 at
ambient temperature [17]. We hypothesized that a large
component of chilling stress transcriptome is a consequence of ROS (H2O2) acting as primary signals for the
activation of ‘early response’ regulatory networks. To
address this hypothesis further, we profiled the temporal
fluctuation of intracellular H2O2 in Nipponbare at 10°C
and 28°C (Figure 5).
Based on the changes in [chilling]/[control] ratios
across time, H2O2 levels were particularly high during
the initial 12 hours. H2O2 profile was characterized by
transient waves indicating the interplay of stress-induced
synthesis and degradation. H2 O2 spikes differ in peak
heights and occurred in three phases, first during the
initial 2 hours followed by two more spikes between 4
and 6 hours and between 8 and 9 hours. After about 12
hours relative concentrations in stressed and control
plants were stabilized as a consequence of the activation
of ROS scavenging systems. Stabilization of H2O2 spikes
was coincident with high expression of many ROS
scavenging genes after 12 hours (see Additional file 4).
Of the 148 chilling upregulated TFs, 62 were also
upregulated by exogenous H2O2 (Table 1). Activities at
phase-1 and phase-2 mirror the temporal profile of cellular H 2 O 2 accumulation. For instance, activation of
many ‘early response’ TFs that were also responsive to
H 2 O 2 coincided with the occurrence of H 2 O 2 spikes
within the initial 12 hours. These temporal coincidences
provide an indirect but strong support that H 2 O 2 is
involved as a primary signal for the activation of ‘early
response’ regulatory network. H2O2 and other ROS are
known to cause conformational changes of the DNAbinding domain of certain TFs [72-74]. We previously
proposed that a constitutively expressed but inactive TF
(e.g., MYB) could be activated by changes in redox status at 10°C and this possibly leads to rapid induction of
its target TFs (e.g., TGA10) occurring at phase-1 [17].
Our current data support this hypothesis and provide a
basis for possible concentration dependence of H2O2inducible gene expression [73].
Regulatory clusters associated with chilling upregulated
transcription factors

Genes encoding non-transcription factor (NTF) proteins
(2,456) were further classified based on expression profiles to establish the composition of various coexpressed groups (regulatory clusters) controlled by the
different classes of TFs listed in Table 1. Genes were
assigned to smaller groups by K-mean clustering to

Yun et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:16
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/16

determine the closest similarities in expression [7]. A
total of 18 clusters were established with members
tightly distributed around the group mean (Figures 6, 7;
see Additional file 5). Based on consensus expression
profiles, genes can be assigned to a three-phase induction pattern similar to that observed among the various
TF classes. Clusters C78, C79, C83A, C86, C86A, C88A,
C90A, C91, C94, C97, C97A and C99A comprised the
‘early rapid response’ group showing activation at phase1 (Figure 6). Clusters C80, C81, C83, C87A and C100A
comprised the ‘early slow response’ group showing activation at phase-2. Only C99 belongs to the ‘late
response’ group (Figure 7). Genes that were activated at
phase-1, phase-2 and phase-3 accounted for 71%, 22%
and 7% of the total NTF genes in the dataset,
respectively.
Genes that were also induced by H 2 O 2 were more
predominant in phase-1 clusters than in phase-2 and
phase-3 clusters. Of the twelve phase-1 clusters, only
C78 (39%) and C88A (16%) had low proportion of H2O2
induced genes. Between 50 to 79% of the genes in ten
other phase-1 clusters (C79, C83A, C86, C86A, C90A,
C91, C94, C97, C97A, C99A) were induced by H 2 O 2
(Figure 6). In contrast, the proportion of H2O2-induced
genes among phase-2 and phase-3 clusters ranged only
between 12 to 49% per cluster (Figure 7). Apparently,
genes that were rapidly induced during exposure to chilling (initial 6 hours) are more likely to respond to exogenous H2O2 than those that were induced at a slower
pace (see Additional file 6). These results further support the hypothesis that oxidative burst during the early
stages of chilling stress was a primary signal for early
gene induction events, and that ‘early response’ transcriptome is controlled largely by TFs responding
directly to primary oxidative signals. This trend is consistent with the induction of large number of genes
associated with disease response, wounding, and ROS
scavenging at phase-1, many of which are associated
with various signals (ethylene, ABA, auxin, salicylic acid,
jasmonic acid) linked directly or indirectly to H 2 O 2 mediated processes [38,62,69,75].
Promoter elements shared in common by the majority
of genes within a cluster were identified to gain further
insights on how gene induction is coordinated [7]. Promoter regions (-1,000 to +200) of more than 70% of
genes in the total dataset were determined by aligning
full-length cDNA with corresponding genomic loci.
Delineated promoter regions were used for ab initio
detection of putative cis-elements by the Dragon Motif
Builder algorithms. Motifs with occurrence of 50% or
higher in a given cluster were matched with known elements in the TRANSFAC, PLACE and AGRIS databases. Motifs were assigned to specific classes based on
known association to specific classes of TFs (Tables 2, 3,

Page 9 of 29

4). The most significantly enriched motifs are related to
several classes of elements associated with MYB, bZIP
and ERF factors. Motifs associated with TF family were
enriched at various levels in 18, 13 and 10 clusters,
respectively (Figures 6, 7; Tables 2, 3, 4). WRKY associated motifs were significantly enriched only in 2 clusters. However, some of the possible WRKY target motifs
(W-box) were quite similar with the as1/ocs/TGA-like
motifs associated with bZIP factors and this may have
reduced the occurrence of WRKY-associated cis-elements in the total gene set [31,75]. Motifs associated
with bHLH and NAC had low occurrence at the 50%
threshold. Other classes of motifs were also detected but
could not be assigned to specific TFs (see Additional file
7).
The predominance of MYB, bZIP and ERF associated
motifs were also quite apparent when the enrichment
analysis was performed on the entire dataset (2,456
genes) as a single group (without clustering) and compared to a subset of known genes not involved in stress
response (background control). This result indicated
that enrichment was not due to random occurrence of
frequently occurring sequences in the japonica rice genome. To assess the biological significance of ab initio
prediction, a select group of putative cis-elements from
the major clusters were tested for binding with nuclear
proteins in vitro by electrophoretic mobility shift assay
(EMSA). The rav1-like (TCT(a/c)AACA), as1/ocs/TGAlike (AATTTGAT, TAATTTGA), pyrimidine box-like
(AAAGAAAAA) and MYB2-like (TAGTTTTT) motifs
enriched in C81, C83A, C79, C97A and C94, respectively, showed band shifts in the presence of pooled
nuclear proteins from chilling stressed (10°C) seedlings
(Figure 8). These results indicate that the sequences are
bona fide binding sites of low temperature-induced
nuclear proteins.
bZIP regulatory clusters

Motifs of the as1/ocs/TGA-like and ABRE-like classes
were the most significantly enriched among the possible
bZIP-target sequences [13,75,76]. Occurrence of the
as1/ocs/TGA-like class was particularly prominent
(score = 100 to 350) in C79, C83, C83A, C86, C86A,
C90A, C91, C94, C97, C99A and C100A (Figures 6, 7;
Table 2). Only two of these clusters (C83, C100A) were
activated at phase-2 and the rest were activated at
phase-1, indicating that as1/ocs/TGA-like motifs are critical features of rapid response genes. Clusters enriched
with as1/ocs/TGA-like elements also appeared to be
more responsive to exogenous H2O2 based on high proportion (53 to 79%) of H 2 O 2 -induced genes among
those clusters. This is an indication of direct relationships between rapid induction, as1/ocs/TGA-like element and responsiveness to H 2 O 2 , which we also
observed in our previous analysis of a smaller subset of

upregulated genes [17]. The as1/ocs/TGA elements are
key components of regulatory modules involved in
auxin, salicylic acid and jasmonic acid mediated gene
expression in response to wounding, oxidative stress
and pathogen attack, providing direct support that ‘early
response’ genes are direct consequences of primary oxidative signals [28,30,31,33,68,77]. This is also in agreement with the timing of H2O2 spikes within the initial 6
to 12 hours at 10°C (Figure 5).
Activation of as1/ocs/TGA-like element-enriched clusters can be associated with several phase-1
(Os08g43090: RF2b-like protein, Os06g41100: TGA10,
Os08g38020: AtbZIP148-like protein) and a phase-2
(Os04g10260: bZIP domain protein) bZIP genes that
were also induced by H 2 O 2 (Figure 2). In tobacco,
TGA10 has been shown to directly bind to an as1/ocs/
TGA-like sequence and its transient expression
enhanced the expression of downstream pathogenesisrelated (PR) target genes via auxin, salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signaling pathways [31]. Consistent with
this, our recent results showed that as1/ocs/TGA-like

element-containing genes were among those that were
activated in a chilling or H2O2-independent manner in
transgenic rice overexpressing TGA10 (data not shown).
In addition, three other H2O2-induced bZIP genes that
were activated at phase-3 (Os02g09830/Os02g03960:
ocs-binding factor, Os05g37170: TGA6) are also likely to
be involved in the regulation of as1/ocs/TGA-like element-enriched clusters. These genes could be the direct
targets of bZIP genes induced at phase-1, thus they are
possible components of ROS-bZIP sub-regulons. The
ROS-bZIP genes belong to the groups involved in
defenses to pathogens, photomorphogenesis, GA
response and sucrose signaling, and this suggests important roles of their downstream regulon in the integration
of stress and developmental responses [24,29].
ABRE-like motifs typically found among ABA-regulated genes were particularly enriched (scores = 100 to
400) in C88A, C91, C94 and C99A (Figure 6; Table 2)
[5,13,75]. These clusters are likely due at least in part to
two ABRE-associated TFs induced at phase-3
(Os02g52780: AB15, Os01g64000: ABF). In addition to

*Also similar to W-box (WRKY) motifs.

ABRE-like motifs, C91, C94, and C99A were also
enriched with as1/ocs/TGA-like elements and all three
clusters had large proportions of H2O2 induced genes
(67%, 70%, 64%, respectively). These clusters were activated in two phases (early and late), which are likely due
to early and late activities of bZIP-TGA and bZIP-ABF
genes, respectively (Figure 2). WRKY factors appear to
be involved in modulation of ABA-mediated expression,
particularly in C91 which is enriched with W-box-like
motifs. Some of the as1/ocs/TGA-like motifs in C94 and
C99A were also quite similar to W-box-like elements,
which could be functioning as WRKY target elements
[78]. WRKY genes could be regulatory fine-tuners by
acting as repressors of ABA-induced genes at phase-1
and phase-2 [60].
ERF regulatory clusters

Enrichment of ERF associated motifs in several clusters
was consistent with the activities of several ERF genes
belonging to groups I, II, III, IV, VI, VII, VIII, IX and X
[37]. ERF associated motifs were divided into two
classes. The first includes DRE/CRT-like and rav1-like
motifs, which are typically found among abiotic stress
induced genes controlled by DREB/CBF, RAV1 and
RAP2 [3,5,6,27]. This class of motifs occurred in 10
clusters but their enrichment was relatively subtle compared to other non-ERF-type motif classes (Figures 6, 7;
Table 3).
Clusters C78, C81, C86, C97A and C90A were most
enriched with DRE/CRT-like and rav1-like elements
(scores = 61 to 130), while C79, C80, C83A, C86 and C99
had intermediate (scores = 50 to 60) enrichment (Figures

6, 7). Clusters C78, C79, C80, C83A, C86, C90A and
C97A were activated at phase-1 and this is likely due to
several Group-II (Os06g11940: RAP2.1/2.6/2.10 group),
Group-III (Os02g45450: DREB1A/CBF3, Os08g43210/

CBF2), Group-VII (Os12g40960: AP2 protein,
Os03g08500: ERF2-like) and RAV1-like (Os01g04750:
ABI3/VP1) genes that were also activated at phase-1 (Figure 2). Clusters C80 and C81 were activated at phase-2,
which are likely due to a different set of Group-II
(Os03g15660: RAP2.1/2.6/2.10 group), Group-III
(Os06g03670: DREB1A/CBF3) and Group-VII
(Os03g08490: ERF2-like) genes distinct from those acting
on phase-1 genes. Two genes from Group-III
(Os09g35020: DREB1D/CBF3) and RAV1-family
(Os01g04800: ABI3/VP1) appear to be involved in ‘late
response’ regulation in C99. Many DREB/CBF-regulated
genes are also activated through ABA-mediated pathway
[5]. Thus, the Group-I (Os04g44670: AtERF053,
Os06g11860: AtERF058, Os03g09170: AtERF058), GroupGroup-IV (Os05g28350: AtERF052/ABI4) and Group-X
(Os09g28440) genes associated with ABA response may
also be involved in the activation of DRE/CRT/rav1-like
element-enriched clusters in response to ABA.
The second group of ERF associated elements includes
the GCC-box-like and jasmonic acid response elementlike (JAre) motifs (Figures 6, 7; Table 3) involved in disease and wounding responses and regulation of indole
alkaloid metabolism [37-39]. These motif classes were
particularly enriched in C81, C83, C88A, C91, C94 and
C100A. Clusters C88A, C91 and C94 were activated at

group-VIII (Os04g52090: AtERF4, Os03g08500: AtERF2,

and C100A (Figure 3).
ERF genes are also likely components of oxidativemediated regulatory mechanism. Genes induced by

MYB regulatory clusters

Potential MYB-target sequences were ubiquitous in
almost all clusters implying that MYB genes are functioning either singly or in synergy with other TFs (Figures 6, 7; Table 4). MYB-related motifs are quite
diverse, but can be classified into two classes. MYB2box-like motifs were significantly over-represented
(scores = 50 to 250) in C79, C86, C87A, C88A, C90A,
C91, C94, C97A and C100A (Figures 6, 7; Table 4).
Their high occurrence among chilling induced genes
appears to be linked to the activities of R2R3-type MYB,
which have been shown to directly interact with MYB2-

box-like elements in the promoters of osmotic, drought
and ABA induced genes [50,52,79-81]. Several OsMYB2
(Os01g18240, Os05g04820) and OsMYB4 (Os04g43680,
Os02g41510, Os10g33810) homologs are likely the
major players in the activation of C79, C86, C87A,
C88A, C90A, C91, C94, C97A and C100A, perhaps in
response to ABA, H2O2 or both. The second group of
MYB-target elements includes several species of GA
response element-like (GARE) and pyrimidine-box-like
motifs, which are typically found among gibberellic acid
(GA) regulated genes [79]. These elements were particularly enriched (scores = 60 to 500) in C78, C79, C80,

C81, C83, C83A, C86A, C87A, C88A, C90A, C91, C94,
C97, C97A, C99, C99A and C100A. Recent studies have
shown that R1-MYB particularly the SHAQKYF-type
activates their GA-responsive targets through GARE and
pyrimidine box-like elements [52].
R1-MYB genes are generally involved in seedling
development and growth and they are known to regulate genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate
breakdown
(amylases,
glucanases,
carboxypeptidases) for energy maintenance during early
seedling growth [82,83]. Consistent with this, a number
of R1-MYB genes were induced at 10°C including few
SHAQKYF-type (Os06g07640, Os08g04840). Activities
of these and other related R1-MYB genes are likely
responsible for activating the GARE or pyrimidine boxlike element-enriched clusters. Seedlings at the early
stages of growth (V3) were used in the microarray studies, during which the endosperm was only partially
degenerated. Growth at this stage requires mechanisms
to integrate stress and developmental signals. The
GARE or pyrimidine-box-like element-enriched clusters
may be important for the integration of early growth
and stress-related energy demands, which have been
suggested as the key aspects of seedling vigor expression
[84].
Broad distribution of MYB-related elements among
chilling upregulated genes has important regulatory and
physiological implications. MYB-target elements often
occur in combination with one or more other types of
element (Figures 6, 7), which implies that MYB factors
are key components of combinatorial control mechanisms in conjunction with other major classes of chilling
induced TFs (bZIP, ERF, WRKY) either as activators or
repressors [49,50]. MYB-regulatory clusters may be
involved in both stress and growth related processes.
Within the context of seedling cold tolerance, MYB factors may be involved in coordinating the expression of
genes required to modulate growth related processes at
sub-optimal temperature.
Combinatorial control of chilling stress transcriptional
network: Hypothetical models

Our current data indicate that regulatory modules involving bZIP Group-D, Group-I and Group-S (as1/ocs/
TGA-like clusters), bZIP Group-A (ABRE-like clusters),
DREB/CBF, RAP2 and RAV1 (DRE/CRT/rav1-like clusters), ERF (GCC box/JAre-like clusters), R1-MYB
(GARE/pyrimidine-box-like clusters), R2R3-MYB
(MYB2-box-like clusters), and WRKY (W-box-like clusters) TFs define the overall chilling stress response regulome of japonica rice. Based on these information,
hypothetical models depicting the integration of various
network components were established reflecting the
complexity and hierarchical interaction among the various TFs acting on a given subset of chilling induced

Page 17 of 29

genes (Figure 9). Based on the cis-element enrichment
trends shown in Figures 6 and 7, some clusters involve
relatively simple activation mechanism with one dominant class of regulatory genes. Examples are C83A, C91,
C97A and C99A, which were primarily controlled by
as1/ocs/TGA (bZIP), ABRE (bZIP), GARE/pyrimidine
box (R2R3-MYB) and as1/ocs/TGA (bZIP) regulatory
modules, respectively. Other clusters involved complex
mechanisms with two or more dominant classes of TFs
that may either be activated independent of each other
or functioning as components of combinatorial control
mechanisms. Examples are C79, C86, C90A and C100A,
which involved as1/ocs/TGA (bZIP) + GARE/pyrimidine
box (R2R3-MYB), as1/ocs/TGA (bZIP) + Myb2-box
(R2R3-MYB), as1/ocs/TGA (bZIP) + GARE/pyrimidine
box (R2R3-MYB) + W-box (WRKY), and as1/ocs/TGA
(bZIP) + GCC-box/JAre (ERF), respectively. Many
examples of the combinatorial control are well known
particularly those involved in ABA responses
[26,77,85,86]. At the center of the chilling stress regulatory network is ROS (H2O2) which acts as primary signal triggering the activities of ‘early response’ expression
clusters. For instance, as1/ocs/TGA-like motifs are
dominant in C83A and this cluster was also enriched
with H2O2-responsive genes (65%). Therefore, an oxidative signal-mediated bZIP-TGA regulon appears to be a
major component of this cluster. Similarly, C97A
appeared to be regulated by R1-MYB. This cluster only
had moderate enrichment of H 2 O 2 -responsive genes
(Figure 6), thus an oxidative-independent regulon is
likely to be part of this cluster.
Many of the putative ERF-regulated clusters represent
examples of complex regulatory mechanisms (Figure 9).
Clusters C81 and C86 for instance are enriched with
DRE/CRT-like or rav1-like motifs and one or more
other class of elements. Both clusters have low proportion of H 2 O 2 -responsive genes (Figures 6, 7), thus
DREB/CBF regulon is likely to be a component of these
clusters. Genes belonging to these clusters are likely to
be regulated by combinatorial mechanism involving
other TFs such as MYB for C81 and bZIP-TGA and
MYB for C86 (Figure 9). Enrichment of DRE/CRT-like
and rav1-like elements was less pronounced compared
to other types of elements (Figures 6, 7, 9). It is possible
that milder cold stress activates only a fraction of the
entire regulon that would otherwise be induced under
more severe cold conditions such as those that induce
CA in temperate plants. It has been suggested that differences among plant species with respect to DREB/CBF
regulon could be due to limited distribution of DRE/
CRT-like elements in the genomes of chilling sensitive
species and this might be true in rice [42].
Unlike bZIP, ERF and MYB-related elements, motifs
associated with WRKY, NAC and bHLH TFs had lower

Models were based on integrative analysis of temporal co-expression, promoter motif enrichment and responses to oxidative mimic (see Figures
6 and 7). Each expression cluster is connected with all possible transcriptional regulator(s) based on coordinate expression patterns and overrepresentation of the target cis-elements associated with that class of transcription factor. Heavy green line represents the primary regulatory
mechanism (most enriched elements). Solid black and dotted gray lines represent secondary and tertiary regulatory mechanisms, respectively.

enrichment among the chilling induced genes (Figures 6,
7; see Additional file 7). W-box-like enrichment in
C90A appears to be associated with the function of
WRKY factors as repressor of ABA-inducible expression.
Preliminary analysis of chilling downregulated genes
indicate that putative WRKY, MYC and NAC-target elements were among the enriched motifs (data not
shown). Thus, most WRKY, NAC and MYC genes are
likely functioning primarily as repressors of chilling
stress response gene expression [54,59,60,87].

Physiological implications of upregulated transcriptional
clusters

Of the 2,456 chilling upregulated NTF genes, 93%
(2,295) could be assigned to one or more molecular or
biochemical process based on integrated analysis of
Gene Ontology [21] and protein domain i.e., INTERPRO
[88] databases (see Additional file 5). Nearly 30% (699)
were described with various types of ‘cellular response’
or ‘stress’ related keywords including defense
(GO:0006952),
stress
(GO:0006950),

(GO:0009725), wounding (GO:0009611), oxidative
(GO:0006979), cold (GO:0050826, GO:0042309,
GO:0050825) and various stimuli including biotic
(GO:0009607), abiotic (GO:0009628), external
(GO:0009605) and hormone (GO:0009725). Three functional categories reflecting the major processes involved
in chilling stress response mechanism were established.
Stress signaling and response regulation

Processing and transduction of environmental signals to
the nucleus constitute the initial events in the execution
of adaptive responses [4,7,62]. About 20% (494) of the
upregulated NTF genes are associated with signaling
and response regulatory processes such as protein phosphorylation (GO:0004674, GO:0004713), receptor recognition (GO:0004872, GO:0007154, GO:0004871), Ca2+
signaling (GO:0005509, GO:0005544), small GTPase
coupled signaling (GO:0007186, GO:0007264), and

generation of second messengers (GO:0046488,
GO:0007165, GO:0004435) (Figure 10; see Additional
file 5).
A significant increase in the rate of mRNA synthesis
was implied by genes required for the assembly of basal
transcription machinery including those involved in
transcription initiation and elongation, tRNA synthesis,
and transcript processing (GO:0003700, GO:0003723,
GO:0003712, GO:0016439, GO:0003677, GO:0003899,
GO:0030528, GO:0003702). Enhanced activities of these
genes reflect an increased rate of de novo mRNA synthesis required for activation of response-related transcriptome. Nearly 60% of genes associated with signaling and
response regulation were also induced by H2O2, further
supporting the central role of oxidative signaling in chilling stress response mechanism. Although the genes in
this category are widely distributed among 18 clusters,

upregulated genes. (A) Signaling and response regulation; (B) Cellular defense and rescue. Also see Additional files 8, 9 and 10 for specific GO/
IPRO terminologies relevant to each functional category.

Yun et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:16
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/16

phase-1 clusters tend to be more enriched than phase-2
and phase-3 clusters, further indicating that critical signaling events occur during the initial 6 hours.
Cellular defense and rescue

About 30% (769) of total NTF genes are associated with
cellular defense and rescue processes. Genes involved in
biogenesis or repair of damaged cellular components
comprised about 14% of total NTF genes (Figure 10; see
Additional file 5). Dominant classes were chaperones,
heat shock proteins and proteases involved in rescue or
turnover of damaged proteins (GO:0006508,
GO:0006511, GO:0016567, GO:0000151, GO:0030693,
GO:0004185), proteins involved in membrane and cell
wall
biogenesis
(GO:0008654,
GO:0045300,
GO:0006869, GO:0042546, GO:0042545) and DNA
repair (GO:0006284, GO:0006281, GO:0003684) [89].
Genes associated with oxidative stress including cellular redox regulators (GO:0045454, GO:0004602,
GO:0004601, GO:0006801, GO:0006979; see Additional
file 8) and pathogen defense and apoptosis-related proteins (GO:0009607, GO:0009605, GO:0009405,
GO:0004568, GO:0006952, GO:0006915, GO:0042742;
see Additional file 9) represent another major class of
defense and rescue associated genes with about 11% of
total NTF genes. Cellular redox regulatory processes
include the components of glutathione system, respiratory burst proteins, and ROS-scavengers such as peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate
peroxidase, thioredoxins, and metallothionein-like proteins [73]. Genes associated with defenses against pathogens include a large number of NBS-LRR-type disease
resistance proteins and various pathogenesis-related
(PR) proteins such as chitinases, glucanases, thaumatinlike, germin-like, cupin-like, and dirigent proteins, viral,
bacterial, and elicitor-induced proteins, and proteins
involved in phenylpropanoid, salicylic acid, jasmonic
acid and phytoallexin metabolism [90-94]. This trend
shows striking similarities between chilling-induced
defenses and those associated with responses to pathogens and wounding, all of which are linked to H2O2 signaling [75,95].
About 2% of genes associated with cellular defense
and rescue are involved in detoxification and efflux processes (GO:0006855, GO:0015904, GO:0006904,
GO:0006887, GO:0006814) (Figure 10; see Additional
file 10). Various classes of multi-drug resistance, MATE
efflux and other types of proteins involved in the extrusion or sub-cellular sequestration of toxic compounds
were in this group [96,97]. Many of these genes are also
involved in defenses against pathogens. Based on the
expression of osmotins and aquaporins and other genes
involved in galactinol and trehalose biosynthesis, maintenance of root and leaf water balance and cellular
osmotic adjustment (GO:0005992, GO:0009719; see

Page 20 of 29

Additional file 5) are important components of defense
mechanism [98-100]. Genes associated with thermal regulation such as homoiothermic/freezing-associated proteins (GO:0042309, GO:0050825, GO:0050826) were
also induced with more than 2% of total NTF genes (see
Additional file 5).
A small group of novel stress-induced genes were also
assumed to be part of the defense and rescue category,
with nearly 1% of total NTF genes. These genes are
known only by virtue of their responsiveness to developmental and environmental stress factors such as cold,
drought, salinity, wounding, hypoxia, ABA and senescence (see Additional file 5). Included in this group are
several homologs of stress-related genes belonging to
the early responsive to dehydration (ERD) and LEA/
dehydrin families.
Nearly 60% of genes associated with cellular defense
and rescue mechanism were induced by both chilling
and H2O2. Many involved in redox regulation, pathogen
defense, apoptosis and proteolysis (Figure 10). This
trend implies that defense processes are essentially consequences of chilling-induced oxidative stress and this is
consistent with the fact that abiotic and biotic stresses
induce a common set of genes through an oxidativemediated pathway. Cellular defense and rescue related
genes are widely distributed in all of 18 clusters. However, phase-1 clusters tend to be more enriched with
this functional category than phase-2 and phase-3 clusters (see Additional file 6) implying that short-term
adaptation depends on timely activation of defense and
rescue mechanisms.
Physiological adjustment and sustenance

Maintenance of cellular homeostasis is critical for sustained growth and survival under sub-optimal temperature. Cellular physiology must be adjusted to
accommodate stress-related demands and metabolic
requirements. Means to compensate or replenish metabolic intermediates that have been diverted towards
costly defense and rescue processes are necessary for
physiological sustenance. The largest category of NTF
genes represents diverse molecular and biochemical
functions suggesting the nature of physiological adjustment and sustenance processes. This category accounts
for more than 40% (1,032) of the total NTF genes (see
Additional files 5, 11).
Increase in de novo protein synthesis was indicated by
genes involved in ribosome assembly and translation
(GO:0006412, GO:0003735, GO:0008135, GO:0006446)
and protein folding and modification (GO:0006464,
GO:0019538, GO:0006457). Genes involved with cellular
energetics (GO:0006118, GO:0006096, GO:0006094,
GO:0015979, GO:0006091), transport mechanism and
facilitation (GO:0006810, GO:0005215, GO:0006865,
GO:0015986, GO:0016469, GO:0008643, GO:0046907),

Yun et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:16
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/16

carbohydrate, lipid, amino acid and secondary metabolic
processes (GO:0008610, GO:0006633, GO:0008299,
GO:0006629, GO:0009058, GO:0005975, GO:0019748,
GO:0006807), cellular biogenesis (GO:0005875,
GO:0005856) and growth (GO:0006260, GO:0016575,
GO:0006333, GO:0006334) were highly represented in
this category. Genes associated with physiological
adjustment and sustenance are widely distributed among
18 expression clusters but more highly represented in
the slower clusters (phase-2, phase-3). This trend suggests that physiological adjustment and sustenance processes occurred largely during the middle to later stages
of stress (see Additional file 6) and reflects the biochemical costs of regulatory and defense related activities
during the earlier stages of stress. It also suggests that
‘late response’ genes are important for recovery process.
Agronomic implications of chilling stress regulatory
clusters

Stress tolerance potential is governed by quantitative
trait loci (QTL) and TFs are likely to be major components of QTL. To investigate possible association
between stress tolerance QTL and the major activators
of oxidative-mediated chilling stress response, genomic
locations of chilling upregulated TFs were determined
in relation to genomic boundaries of relevant QTL that
have been anchored to the Nipponbare genome
sequence [21]. The ratio of QTL-associated to nonQTL-associated genes in the total annotated gene set in
the microarray (whole genome) was determined by
Fisher exact test and compared with the corresponding
ratios within the upregulated gene subset. Significant
enrichment was defined by a higher ratio in the upregulated gene subset (relative to genome-wide ratio) at p <
0.25. A total of 42 chilling induced TFs were located
within the genomic boundaries 46 QTL for cold tolerance (COLDTL), seedling vigor (SDLVIG), osmotic
adjustment capacity (OSADJCAP), salt sensitivity
(SALTSN), chlorophyll content (CHLCN), leaf rolling
(LFRL), and speed of germination (GERMSP) (see Additional file 12). SDLVG, CHLCN, COLDTL and OSADJCAP had the most number of co-localized TFs with 24,
16, 12, and 10 genes, respectively.
We also examined the differences in expression of
representative TFs between Nipponbare and INIAP12
rice cultivars (Figure 11). These cultivars represent contrasting sensitivity to chilling based on seedling survival
test (Figure 12). Chilling-induced expression of TFs in
Nipponbare occurred earlier and was more robust than
INIAP12, consistent with results from previous studies
[14,17]. Differential expression of TFs positively correlates with the responses of japonica and indica cultivars
to chilling. About 4 weeks after continuous exposure to
10°C, 50% of indica seedlings were either dead or with
severe injury symptoms. Mild injuries occurred in

Page 21 of 29

japonica seedlings only after about 6 weeks. Based on
these results, stress response transcriptome is tightly
associated with the expression of vigor.

Conclusion
We studied the regulatory and physiological implications
of chilling stress (10°C) transcriptome of japonica rice
based on integrative analysis of whole-genome expression profiles and promoter architectures. Our analysis
has taken into consideration the hypothesis that oxidative signaling is central in integrating various components of the regulatory network. We addressed this
hypothesis by dissecting the commonalities between a
direct response to cold stimulus and responses to low
temperature-independent mimic of oxidative signaling.
From the systems-level approach employed in this
study, several important themes emerged. First, oxidative signaling by H2O2 is at the center of the regulatory
network, particularly in relation to the execution of
‘early response’ mechanisms (initial 24 hours). H2O2 has
long been recognized as a major trigger of stress
response signaling and its important role in interfacing
abiotic and biotic stress responses with growth and
development has been established [67,68,101,102]. Until
now, direct links of the primary oxidative signals to chilling-associated transcriptional changes has not been
demonstrated at the genome-wide scale. Our current
results contribute important information that fills this
knowledge gap.
About 60% of chilling stress induced genes are triggered by oxidative signals either as primary or secondary targets. Much of the oxidative-mediated changes in
gene expression occurred during the initial 24 hours
and the composition of the transcriptome has striking
similarities to disease response mechanisms in terms of
the activities of genes involved in redox regulation,
responses to organic toxins and wounding, phenylpropanoid and indole alkaloid metabolism, and jasmonic
acid, salicylic acid and ethylene signaling [39,62,73].
H 2 O 2 is likely to be the primary signal closest to the
original stimulus (chilling) providing the initial trigger
for a cascade of molecular processes leading to an
intricately interconnected gene expression circuitry
[101,102]. The timing and scope of oxidative mediated
regulatory clusters justify their major contribution to
immediate defenses, which are critical for a species like
rice that can only endure transient exposure to milder
cold stress.
Second, our current data revealed a number of oxidative-mediated early response expression clusters associated with specific classes of regulatory sequences such
as as1/ocs/TGA-like, GCC-box/JAre-like and Myb2box-like cis-elements. Several classes of TFs are likely to
act on these clusters including bZIP Group-D (TGA),

Figure 11 Differential expression of chilling induced genes in Nipponbare (less sensitive) and INAP12 (more sensitive). Transcript levels
were compared by quantitative real time PCR. Cultivars can be distinguished by the relative speed of gene induction. In general, induction
occurs earlier and was more robust in Nipponbare (green) than INIAP12 (blue). Expression analysis was based on the average of three replicates

Evaluation System, where a score of 1 = seedlings are dark green and healthy, 3= seedlings are pale green, 5 = seedlings are yellow and
partially withering, 7 = seedlings are brown and withered, and 9 = seedlings are dead. Occurrence of seedlings with a score of ≥3 was
monitored for a 30-day period. A total of 120 plants were analyzed for each cultivar. Values represent the average of three replicates (SE shown
as error bars).

Group-S (ocs), and Group-I (GA-associated), ERF
Group-I (subfamily A-6), Group-IV (subfamily A-2),
Group-VI (subfamily B-5), Group-VII (subfamily B-2),
Group-X (subfamily B-4), and R2R3-MYB [24,29,37,60].
Known interactions of these TFs with such elements
and their involvement in various oxidative mediated
processes justify their presumed roles as regulators of
early response transcriptome. Particularly interesting
candidates for regulon engineering are the as1/ocs/
TGA-like element-regulated clusters comprising the largest group of genes associated with oxidative defenses.
Third, we have identified regulatory clusters that
appear to be independent of oxidative signals. Two of
the well known regulons that function during cold acclimation at 4°C in Arabidopsis were among those and
they are the ABRE-like (bZIP-ABF) and CRT/DRE/rav1like (CBF/DREB/RAP2/RAV1) element-enriched clusters.
The third cluster (GARE/pyrimidine-box-like elementenriched) which involves an R1-MYB appears to be a
component of combinatorial control mechanism. ABREenriched clusters appear to be downstream to the oxidative-mediated clusters and this is consistent with the
timing of ABA response, i.e., after 24 hours. Recent
report estimated that 400 protein-coding genes of rice
are regulated via an ABRE requiring mechanism [103].
This number is close to the estimated number of genes
that belong to the chilling induced ABRE-enriched clusters, which is much less than the estimated number of
genes regulated by an oxidative mediated mechanism.
This data provide additional support that oxidative-

mediated mechanism is the primary route for activating
early response genes.
The cold acclimation associated regulons controlled by
DREB/CBF, RAP2 and RAV1 are induced maximally at
4°C in Arabidopsis [13,42,43]. Apparently, orthologous
TFs in rice are induced at 10°C, which probably induce
a different set of target genes distinct from those that
are activated in cold acclimating species. An interesting
trend that we observed was that chilling upregulated
clusters in rice have only moderate enrichment of DRE/
CRT/rav1-like elements compared to other types of elements. The DRE/CRT/rav1-like elements associated
clusters are also enriched with one or more other types
of elements. A possible explanation is that at milder
cold stress, DREB/CBF/RAP2/RAV1-regulated genes
account for a relatively smaller fraction of the transcriptome compared to the oxidative mediated components.
It has also been suggested that the genomes of chilling
insensitive (e.g., Arabidopsis) and sensitive (e.g., rice)
species might differ in terms of the distribution of DRE/
CRT/rav1-like elements [42].
Fourth, our data showed an important role of combinatorial control in chilling stress response gene expression. Combinatorial control has long been recognized
and numerous examples are constantly being reported
in relation to stress response [17,26,77,104]. Interaction
of several classes of TFs facilitates fine-tuned regulation.
Examples of these are the possible roles of WRKY TFs
as repressors of ABA-mediated gene expression, which
allows fine-tuned regulation of oxidative mediated

Yun et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:16
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/16

transcriptome in relation to ABA-mediated responses.
Interaction of several TF classes also facilitates integration of various signals associated with stress, growth and
development. GARE/pyrimidine-box-like elements associated with R1-MYB TFs were the most widely distributed elements among the chilling upregulated clusters.
This class of elements occurred in various combinations
with other classes. R1-MYB TFs are primarily involved
in gibberellic acid regulated growth processes [79,82,83].
R1-MYB factors appear to coordinate and fine-tune
gene expression required for growth modulation and
survival at sub-optimal temperature, which appear to be
a key aspect of vigor enhancement and/or maintenance
under stress conditions.
Finally, our results provide a global picture of biochemical and physiological consequences of the regulatory networks induced at 10°C. The obvious theme is
the striking similarities of chilling-induced processes to
those associated with defenses against pathogens and
responses to wounding. The predominance of genes
involved in disease response signaling was indicated by
large number of LRR, NBS-LRR, NB-ARC types of
receptor proteins, genes associated with hypersensitive
response, wounding, herbivory, redox regulation, cellular
detoxification, programmed cell death, and terpenoid
metabolism most of which are linked to jasmonic acid,
salicylic acid and ethylene signaling. Activities of these
genes provide further evidence that oxidative signal was
the origin of most of the early responses.
The agronomic significance of the current results is
quite interesting. The data provide a global picture of
how stress, growth and developmental responses are
integrated by the interaction of at least four major
classes of TF. The interesting relationship between TF
expression and QTL for stress tolerance and seedling
vigor might be the key for further understanding of the
precise mechanisms that make japonica rice withstand
chilling better than indica rice. Genes related to stress
response, growth, development and energy partitioning
are often enriched within the boundaries of QTL associated with vigor and yield. An emerging theme is that
linkage blocks with certain allelic combinations of
stress-related genes involved in responses to diseases,
dehydration, temperature extremes, and light stress are
important components of plant vigor and heterosis
[18,105-108]. Modulated growth, physiological sustenance and maintenance of vigor appear to be the downstream consequences of the transcriptional networks
induced by chilling, providing a means to delay the
occurrence of irreversible injuries. This hypothesis is
consistent with the fact that many japonica cultivars are
able to survive chilling for a much longer period of
exposure than most indica cultivars.

Methods
Plant materials, growth conditions, and stress treatments

Rice cultivars with contrasting sensitivities to chilling, i.
e., Nipponbare and CT6748 (less sensitive) and INIAP12
and IR36 (more sensitive) were used in this study. Seedlings were grown to three-leaf (V3 ) stage at optimum
temperature (28°C) before exposure to chilling condition
(10°C) in a Pervical E30BHO growth chamber (Percival
Scientific, Perry, IA). These experiments were performed
based on previously described methods [14,17]. For the
H2O2 experiment, seedlings were grown to V3 stage in
standard Yoshida hydroponic solution at 28°C. Experimental plants were transferred to fresh medium with 4
mM H2O2 while the control plants were maintained in
medium without H2O2. Tissues were harvested after 1, 3
and 6 hours of treatment and another 6 hours of recovery in fresh medium without H2O2. Total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
from leaves after 0.5, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 96
hours of exposure to chilling and after each sampling
time in the H2O2 experiment. Seedling survival analysis
was performed as previously described [14].
Microarray analysis

RNA samples from control and experimental Nipponbare seedlings were processed with the MessageAmp II
aRNA amplification and T7 polymerase in vitro transcription kits producing at least 20 μg of aminoallyldUTP-labeled aRNA. The cDNA samples were synthesized with oligo-dT primer and ArrayScript reverse transcriptase. All procedures were according to
manufacturer’s instructions (Ambion, Austin, TX).
Equal amounts of Cy5- and Cy3-labeled samples were
combined in 1× hybridization buffer composed of 50%
formamide, 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS and 10 mM DTT. Chemical labeling with Cy3 (control) and Cy5 (treatment)
dyes was performed according to manufacturer’s protocol (GE Healthcare-Amersham, Piscataway, NJ).
The NSF rice oligonucleotide microarray version 3,
which contains roughly 45,000 probes representing all
40,000 predicted genes of japonica rice was used in all
experiments. Pre-hybridization treatments were
according to manufacturer’s instructions [19]. Hybridization was performed for 18 hours at 42°C in Hybex
Humidified Thermal Blocks (Scigene, Sunnyvale, CA).
Stringency washing was performed at 42°C in 2× SSC,
0.1% SDS and 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS and at room temperature in 0.1× SSC for 10 minutes each step. Expression data was acquired with the Axon 4000A scanner
and processed with the GenePix Pro 5.1 (Axon-Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Two independent biological replicates were performed for each control by
treatment comparison. Dye-swap experiments were
initially performed to assess dye by sample interaction,

Yun et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:16
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/16

which was found to be negligible. Gene expression
data was normalized globally prior to high level analysis. Microarray dataset can be accessed by GSE8767
and GSE10062 at the Gene Expression Omnibus [109].
Values represent the log 2 ratio of background subtracted intensity values (Cy5/Cy3). High level statistical
analyses (T-test, hierarchical and K-mean clustering)
were performed with the MeV Bioinformatics Tools
[110]. Protein-coding genes with log 2 fold ≥ 1.8 (p <
0.05) in at least two consecutive time points for the
chilling stress experiment and at least one time point
for the H2O2 experiment were first identified from the
total dataset. Genes that passed these criteria comprised the total gene set for high-level analysis. TFs
were identified and grouped according to family
according to the Database of Rice Transcription Factors [22]. Members of each family were hierarchically
clustered while the NTFs were divided into smaller
groups by K-mean clustering. NTFs were further classified by functional categories using the RiceCyc pathway [21] and Interpro protein domain [87] databases.
Co-location and enrichment of candidate genes within
the boundaries of relevant QTL was performed with
Fisher exact test based on current information in Gramene QTL database [21].
Ab initio promoter analysis

Promoter motif enrichment analysis was performed on
the entire set of upregulated NTFs (2,456) and individually for each K-mean cluster [17]. Sequences of bona
fide promoter regions (-1,000 to +200) were extracted
from the Nipponbare genome sequence by locating the
experimentally validated transcription start site (TSS) by
alignment with FLcDNA [111]. The Dragon Motif
Builder algorithm with EM2 option was used to detect
over-represented motifs [112]. Thirty motifs (8 to 10 nt)
were detected each run with a threshold value of 0.875.
Promoters of randomly selected genes not associated
with stress response mechanisms were used for background subtraction of random motif occurrence. Significant motifs were selected based on a threshold
occurrence of 50%. Motif classes were identified by significant matches with TRANSFAC [113,114], PLACE
[115] and AGRIS [116,117] databases.
Real-time PCR analysis

Comparative analysis of selected chilling upregulated
genes between Nipponbare and INIAP12 was performed
by real-time PCR as previously described [17]. PCR
reactions were performed with the Verso cDNA synthesis and Absolute QPCR Sybr Green mix (AbGene,
Rochester, NY) using the myCycler real-time PCR system (Biorad, Hercules, CA).
H2O2 concentration assay

Total H2O2 content of rice leaves was determined by the
Amplex Red (10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine) assay

Page 25 of 29

(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to established procedures [18]. Leaf discs were homogenized in chilled 5%
TCA. Crude extracts were centrifuged at 12,000×g for
10 minutes and further purified with Dowex anion
exchange resin (AG1X100). Samples were buffered to
pH 7.4 with 0.25M NaH2PO4. Concentration was measured every 30 minutes by the absorbance at 560 nm
with three replicates.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)

Nuclear protein extraction was performed based on
established procedures [118,119]. Proteins were
extracted from leaf tissues (10 g) after exposure to
chilling (10°C) for 6, 12 and 24 hours and quantified
by Bradford method. EMSA was performed with the
Gel Shift Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Double stranded
oligonucleotide probes were synthesized and endlabeled with [g-32P]-dATP (3,000Ci/mmol) by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Unlabelled probes were removed
using the Bio-Spin 6 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Binding
reactions (10 μg nuclear extract +1 μl 32 P-labeled
probe) were carried out for 30 minutes at room temperature. For competition experiments, excess unlabeled probes were added in approximately eight-fold
molar ratio relative to labeled probes. Binding reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel.
