Differential responses of the mosquito Aedes
albopictus from the Indian Ocean region to two
chikungunya isolates

Abstract
Background: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are both vectors of chikungunya virus (CHIKV). The two Aedes
species co-exist in the Indian Ocean region and were involved in the 2005-2006 CHIKV outbreaks. In the Reunion
Island, a single mutation in the viral envelope has been selected that leads to high levels of replication in Ae.
albopictus, and a short extrinsic incubation period as the virus could be found in saliva as early as two days after
infection. An important question is whether this variant is associated with adverse effects impacting some
mosquito life-history traits such as survival and reproduction.
Results: We performed experimental infections using three mosquito strains of Ae. aegypti Mayotte and Ae.
albopictus (Mayotte and Reunion), and two CHIKV strains (E1-226A and E1-226V). Ae. aegypti Mayotte were similarly
susceptible to both viral strains, whereas Ae. albopictus Mayotte and Ae. albopictus Reunion were more susceptible
to CHIKV E1-226V than to E1-226A. In terms of life-history traits measured by examining mosquito survival and
reproduction, we found that: (1) differences were observed between responses of mosquito species to the two
viruses, (2) CHIKV infection only affected significantly some life-history traits of Ae. albopictus Reunion and not of
the other two mosquito strains, and (3) CHIKV reduced the lifespan of Ae. albopictus Reunion and shortened the
time before egg laying.
Conclusion: We demonstrated that CHIKV only reduces the survival of Ae. albopictus from the Reunion Island. By
laying eggs just before death, reproduction of Ae. albopictus from the Reunion Island is not reduced since other
parameters characterizing oviposition and hatching were not affected.

Background
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arbovirus (Togaviridae family, Alphavirus genus) transmitted by Aedes
mosquito species, that usually induces an acute illness
in humans characterized by fever, rash, and incapacitating arthralgia [1]. The virus was first described in Tanzania in 1952 [2]. In Africa, it has been maintained in a
sylvatic cycle involving forest mosquitoes feeding preferentially on wild non-human primates [3,4]. The virus
was later introduced into Asia where it circulates within
an urban cycle; only an inter-human transmission cycle
is described on this continent, involving Aedes aegypti
and Aedes albopictus as vectors [5,6].

In early 2005, CHIKV was introduced into the Indian
Ocean region, probably by viremic travelers returning
from Kenya where an outbreak had started in June 2004
[7]. Later, in 2005 and 2006, CHIKV spread across the
Indian Ocean islands (Comoros, Madagascar, Mayotte,
Seychelles, Mauritius, the Reunion Island). Afterwards,
CHIKV expanded into Asia [8-10] and Africa [11,12].
Surprisingly, an autochthonous CHIKV outbreak was
reported in Europe in the Ravenna region of Italy during
the summer of 2007 [13]. Most recent CHIKV outbreaks
were related to the mosquito Ae. albopictus whose geographical distribution has been expanding into new tropical and temperate regions over the past decades [14].
In the Indian Ocean region, Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus are present together or alone; both vectors can be
involved in the CHIKV transmission cycle.

Results
Susceptibility of Aedes species to CHIKV strains

Batches of mosquitoes were orally exposed to serial 10fold dilutions of CHIKV E1-226A and CHIKV E1-226V
(Figure 1). To determine whether disseminated infection
rates correlated with blood-meal titers, surviving mosquitoes were analyzed at day 14 pi by IFA on head
squashes. Ae. aegypti Mayotte showed similar susceptibility towards both CHIKV E1-226A and CHIKV E1226V (p > 0.05); at a titer of 106.5 PFU/mL, 56.1% of
mosquitoes showed a disseminated infection when
infected with CHIKV E1-226V and 51.2% did with
respect to CHIKV E1-226A (Figure 1A). On the other

Phylogenetic analyses based on sequences of the E1
gene encoding an envelope glycoprotein revealed that
the Indian Ocean isolates belonged to the Eastern/Central/Southern African genotype [15]. A switch to a new
variant operated in the Reunion Island from the end of
2005, where most CHIKV isolated from patients presented an amino-acid substitution in the E1 glycoprotein, from an alanine (E1-226A) to a valine (E1-226V).
This mutation enhances transmission by Ae. albopictus
[16]. The new variant spread easily through the Indian
Ocean region and has thus been found in countries
where Ae. albopictus is the main Aedes species. Subsequent CHIKV outbreaks were related to the transmission of the E1-226V variant by Ae. albopictus.
By experimental infections, we demonstrated that
from day 3 post-infection (pi), Aedes mosquitoes could
produce 1,000-fold more viral particles than those
ingested [17]. Although it was believed for many years
that infection with an arbovirus had no deleterious
effects upon its arthropod host, recent studies indicated
that such viral infections may not be benign. When
compared with uninfected individuals, viral infections in
mosquitoes can reduce fecundity [18], the ability to get
a blood-meal [18,19], and survival [20-22]. The effect on
the survival of the mosquito vector is important in
determining vector capacity. How a vector responds to
infection by a virus? Among the strategies developed to
compensate for the cost of infection by a pathogen, a
host could reduce the harm caused by infection by tolerance, which involves the alteration of host life-history
traits. These latter are defined as traits relevant to the
allocation of resources in reproduction, survival and
growth: for example the number of offspring, age of first
reproduction, adult body size etc.
In this work, we have analyzed the effects of CHIKV
infection on survival and reproduction of two mosquito
species, Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. Changes in survival and reproduction induced upon infection with two
CHIKV strains, the original E1-226A strain and the new
E1-226V variant were studied.

hand, Ae. albopictus Mayotte were found to be 1-2 fold
more susceptible to CHIKV E1-226V than to CHIKV
E1-226A (p < 0.01); at a titer of 106.5 PFU/mL, 47.9% of
mosquitoes presented a disseminated infection when
infected with CHIKV E1-226A, in contrast to 91.91%
with CHIKV E1-226V (Figure 1B). Lastly, Ae. albopictus
Reunion displayed the same profile as Ae. albopictus
Mayotte, with significant differences between viruses at

each titer point (p < 0.01) except when the titer was
high (e.g. 107.5 PFU/mL) where both viral strains gave
similar disseminated infection rates (p = 1). All Aedes
species examined presented a similar susceptibility to
CHIKV E1-226A at a titer of 106.5 PFU/mL (p > 0.05).
At this same viral titer, Ae. albopictus (Mayotte and
Reunion) presented a higher susceptibility to CHIKV
E1-226V than did Ae. aegypti Mayotte (Figure 1C). The
plateau corresponding to 100% of disseminated infection
rate was reached for blood-meal titers higher than 108.5
PFU/mL.
Survival of mosquitoes

The survival rates for each mosquito species, depending
on the trial and according to the virus (NI, CHIKV E1226A, CHIKV E1-226V), are presented in Figure 2. The
infectious blood-meals were at a titer of 107.5 PFU/mL.
For Ae. aegypti Mayotte (Figure 2A), each trial led to
the same results: the survival curves were not significantly different according to the infection (p = 0.70 and
p = 0.21 for trials 1 and 2, respectively). A parametric
model was used to estimate the effects on survival of
the strain of the virus (NI, CHIKV E1-226A, CHIKV
E1-226V) and of the infection status of the mosquito
(NI, NDINF, DINF), and to assess the existence of an
interaction between these two factors. For this purpose,
we combined trials 1 and 2 as no significant difference
was detected in NI mosquitoes (p = 0.24), or mosquitoes
exposed to CHIKV E1-226A (p = 0.23) or to CHIKV
E1-226V (p = 0.94). The risk of death was higher for
NDINF mosquitoes compared to NI mosquitoes (Time
ratio [TR] (95% confidence interval) [CI]: 0.60 (0.42 0.85) with CHIKV E1-226V and 0.49 (0.33 - 0.72) with
CHIKV E1-226A). On the other hand, no significant difference in the risk of death was observed between DINF
mosquitoes and NI mosquitoes infected with CHIKV
E1-226V (TR (95% CI): 1.19 (0.91 - 1.56) and with
CHIKV E1-226A (1.10 (0.81 - 1.48)) (Table 1).
For Ae. albopictus Mayotte (Figure 2B), the two trials
mainly led to the same results: survival curves did not
differ significantly according to the virus (p = 0.29 and
p = 0.05 for trials 1 and 2, respectively). To compare the
survival curves, we combined the two trials since no significant difference was found between NI mosquitoes
(p = 0.53), mosquitoes exposed to CHIKV E1-226A (p =
0.55) and CHIKV E1-226V (p = 0.55). Using a parametric
survival model, compared to NI mosquitoes, mosquitoes
exposed to CHIKV E1-226V were not at greater risk of
dying, whether the infection status was NDINF (TR (95%
CI): 1.01 (0.87-1.18)) or DINF (TR (95% CI): 1.01 (0.911.13)). On the other hand, for mosquitoes exposed to
CHIKV E1-226A, NDINF mosquitoes showed a higher
risk of dying than did NI mosquitoes (TR (95% CI): 0.80
(0.67-0.95)) while DINF mosquitoes had a significantly

lower risk of dying (TR (95% CI): 1.15 (1.03-1.28)) than
did NI mosquitoes (Table 1).
For Ae. albopictus Reunion (Figure 2C), the two trials
led to the same results: a significant difference in the survival curves was detected according to the virus (both p <
10-4). Mosquitoes exposed to CHIKV E1-226A or CHIKV
E1-226V had lower survival rates than NI mosquitoes. As
the trials differed significantly when NI mosquitoes (p <
10-4), those exposed to CHIKV E1-226A (p < 10-4) or to
CHIKV E1-226V (p < 10-4) were analyzed, trials were considered separately. Using a parametric survival model, we
found that for mosquitoes exposed to CHIKV E1-226V,
NDINF mosquitoes, as well as DINF mosquitoes, were
more at risk of dying than NI mosquitoes in both trials
(for NDINF mosquitoes, TR (95% CI): 0.43 (0.35-0.54) and
0.52 (0.37-0.74) in trials 1 and 2, respectively; for DINF
mosquitoes: 0.63 (0.54-0.74) and 0.70 (0.59-0.83) in trials 1
and 2, respectively). For mosquitoes exposed to CHIKV
E1-226A, NDINF and DINF mosquitoes were more at risk
of death than NI mosquitoes were, in both trials: for
NDINF mosquitoes, 0.46 (0.37-0.58) and 0.39 (0.28-0.54)
in trials 1 and 2, respectively; and for DINF mosquitoes:
0.74 (0.65-0.86) and 0.62 (0.52-0.73) in trials 1 and 2,
respectively (Table 1).
Oviposition characteristics
Time to first egg laying

In Ae. aegypti Mayotte, the Kaplan-Meier estimates
showed no significant difference in the time to egg laying according to the CHIKV strain (p = 0.20) or the
infection status of the mosquito (p = 0.73). Combining
CHIKV strain and infection status as a single factor, the
parametric survival model showed no effect of these two
factors on the time to egg laying (p = 0.47). In Ae. albopictus Mayotte, the Kaplan-Meier estimates showed no
significant difference in the time to egg laying when the
virus (p = 0.25) or the infection status of the mosquito
(p = 0.31) were examined. The parametric survival
model did not show any effect of the virus and infection
status of mosquito on the time to egg laying (p = 0.50).
In contrast, in Ae. albopictus Reunion, the Kaplan-Meier
estimates showed significant differences in the time to
egg laying when considering the virus (p = 0.03) and the
infection status of mosquito (p = 0.003). The parametric
survival model showed a significant effect of the virus
and infection status of mosquitoes on the time to egg
laying (p < 10 -4 ). Mosquitoes exposed to CHIKV E1226V and CHIKV E1-226A laid eggs significantly earlier
than NI mosquitoes (Table 2).
Number of eggs laid per mosquito

The number of eggs laid according to the mosquito species, virus and infection status of the mosquito is
described in Table 2. Using a negative binomial regression model for each mosquito species, we did not find

DINF

The table shows the life duration of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus from Mayotte and the Reunion Island after infection with two CHIKV strains: CHIKV E1-226A
and CHIKV E1-226V. N corresponds to the number of female analysed, SD to the standard deviation, 1 and 2 to respectively, trial 1 and trial 2, DINF to females

any evidence that the number of eggs laid differed
according to the virus and infection status of the mosquito (data not shown: p = 0.79, 0.82, and 0.47 in Ae.
aegypti Mayotte, Ae. albopictus Mayotte and Ae. albopictus Reunion, respectively).
Time between first oviposition and mosquito death

We also described the time between the first oviposition
and mosquito death using Kaplan-Meier survival curves
performed separately for each mosquito species. No difference according to the virus and infection status of
the mosquito was observed in Ae. aegypti Mayotte (p =
0.33) and Ae. albopictus Mayotte (p = 0.14). In Ae. albopictus Reunion, both trials led to the same conclusion:
when compared to NI mosquitoes, the time was significantly shorter in mosquitoes infected with CHIKV E1226A or CHIKV E1-226V irrespective of whether the
infection status of the mosquito was NDINF or DINF
(p = 0.007 and p = 0.001 for trials 1 and 2, respectively).
Hatching characteristics
Proportion of mosquitoes with at least one egg hatched

When examining the proportion of females with at least
one egg hatched, no significant differences were found
whatever the mosquito species, the virus and the infection status of the mosquito, when results were considered for Ae. aegypti Mayotte (p = 0.71) and Ae.
albopictus Mayotte (p = 0.85). In contrast, for Ae. albopictus Reunion a significant difference was found to be
attribuable to NI mosquitoes (p = 0.02) (Table 3).
Hatching rate per mosquito

When the hatching rate per mosquito was examined,
Ae. aegypti Mayotte mosquitoes were found to show a
slight difference according to the viral strains (p = 0.03)
and not to the infection status of the mosquito (p =
0.15). Similarly, Ae. albopictus Mayotte mosquitoes only
showed a significant difference when viral strains were

considered (p < 10-4) and not the infection status of the
mosquito (p = 0.94). Finally, Ae. albopictus Reunion also
showed differences related to viral strains (p < 10-2) and
not to the infection status of the mosquito (p = 0.12). In
most cases, mosquitoes infected with CHIKV E1-226V
displayed the highest hatching rates (Table 3). Eggs that
issued from infected or non-infected mosquitoes maintained in a BSL-3 laboratory usually showed a lower
capacity to hatch than eggs that were kept in an insectarium under standard conditions (data not shown).
Replication of CHIKV in mosquitoes

Dead mosquitoes were collected once a day. The number of viral RNA copies present in dead mosquitoes did
not vary within a period of 24 h after mosquito death
(data not shown). For Ae. aegypti Mayotte, mosquitoes
had an average of 105.1 (± 100.01) viral RNA copies per
mosquito when a blood-meal containing CHIKV
E1-226A was ingested, and an average of 105.6 (± 100.02)
viral RNA copies per mosquito that had ingested
CHIKV E1-226V (Figure 3A). Following the blood-meal,
viral load increased to reach a maximum of 109.1 ± 100.3
viral RNA copies at day 5 pi for CHIKV E1-226A and
between day 4 (108.4 ± 100.7) and day 6 pi (108.6 ± 100.1)
for CHIKV E1-226V. Later, a slight decrease was
observed until day 14 pi (107.4 ± 100.2 for CHIKV E1226A and 107.3 ± 100.3 for CHIKV E1-226V). For both
viruses, many mosquitoes died between day 1 and day 3
pi, especially at day 1 for Ae. aegypti Mayotte infected
with CHIKV E1-226V.
For Ae. albopictus Mayotte, mosquitoes ingested an
average of 10 5.4 (± 10 0.1 ) viral RNA copies when
exposed to a blood-meal containing CHIKV E1-226A
and 105.1 (± 100.4 ) with CHIKV E1-226V (Figure 3B).
The maximum viral load was reached at day 3 pi after
ingestion of both CHIKV E1-226A (109.0 ± 100.1) and

Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus from Mayotte and the Reunion Island were infected with two CHIKV strains: CHIKV E1-226A and CHIKV E1-226V. N corresponds to the number of female analysed, SD to the standard
deviation, 1 and 2 to respectively, trial 1 and trial 2, DINF to females with disseminated infection, NDINF to females with non-disseminated infection, and NI to non-infected females.

CHIKV E1-226V (10 8.1 ± 10 0.6 ) followed by a plateau
until day 11 pi. At day 14 pi, the number of viral RNA
copies had decreased to 106.5 (± 100.8) for CHIKV E1226A and 107.7 (± 100.1) for CHIKV E1-226V.
In the case of Ae. albopictus Reunion, mosquitoes
ingested an average of 105.1 (± 100.5) RNA copies in the
blood-meal containing CHIKV E1-226A and 10 5.1
(± 100.1) RNA copies for CHIKV E1-226V (Figure 3C).
After a slight increase in the amount of viral RNAs
from day 1 to day 3 pi, a plateau was observed until day
13 pi: 10 7.3 ± 10 0.3 with CHIKV E1-226A and 10 7.9 ±
100.3 with CHIKV E1-226V. Dead females exhibited two
distinct profiles: (i) females which ensured a viral replication at a level similar to that of live females and (ii)
females which did not ensure any viral replication. This
is more clear-cut for ALPROV infected with CHIKV E1226A.

Discussion
Whichever viral strain was examined (E1-226A or E1226V), differential responses to CHIKV infection were
found according to the mosquito species (Ae. aegypti
versus Ae. albopictus) and their geographical origin
(Mayotte versus the Reunion Island). CHIKV infection
affected the life-history traits of Ae. albopictus from the
Reunion Island. We have found that apart from the viral
strains, CHIKV infection induced effects on survival, by
reducing lifespan, and on oviposition characteristics, by
shortening the time to egg laying of Ae. albopictus from
the Reunion Island.
Aedes albopictus is a mosquito species native to
Southeast Asia that has spread beyond its natural habitat by means of intercontinental trades [23]. This mosquito is able to transmit various arboviruses in
laboratory conditions [14]. In addition to this species,
Ae. aegypti is native to Africa and comprises two forms:
the forest-dwelling Ae. a. formosus involved in the
enzootic transmission of arboviruses, and the domestic
form Ae. a. aegypti whose distribution has extended
over the tropical region acting as the main vector of
dengue viruses [24,25]. Both species are containerbreeding mosquitoes that share the same breeding sites.
In Asia, the introduced Ae. aegypti tends to displace Ae.
albopictus from urban settlements [26,27], whereas the
spread of Ae. albopictus has been associated with
declines of Ae. aegypti in the Americas [28,29]. In the
Indian Ocean region, Ae. albopictus was introduced several centuries ago [30] and in the Reunion Island, it was
first recorded in 1913 [31]. On the island, this mosquito
became the most common Aedes species [32] since the
control program against malaria vectors in the 1950s
that led to the confinement of Ae. aegypti in remote
areas [33]. On Mayotte, Ae. aegypti was first recorded in
1943 [34] and Ae. albopictus was observed later, in 2001

The table refers to the hatching characteristics of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus from Mayotte and the Reunion Island infected with two CHIKV strains: CHIKV
E1-226A and CHIKV E1-226V. N corresponds to the number of female analysed, SD to the standard deviation, 1 and 2 to respectively, trial 1 and trial 2, DINF to
females with disseminated infection, NDINF to females with non-disseminated infection, and NI to non-infected females.

[35]. Larvae of both species could be found in artificial
containers making inter-specific resource competition
possible [36,37]. Ae. albopictus predominates in domestic habitats in Mayotte [38].
The CHIKV outbreak began in Kenya in 2004, and
subsequently spread to the islands of the Indian Ocean
[39]. A new strain of CHIKV emerged that carried a
point mutation, which changes the amino acid at position 226 in the E1 envelope glycoprotein from an alanine to a valine [15]. This single mutation has increased
the vector competence of Ae. albopictus for CHIKV
[16,40]. This increased transmissibility of CHIKV is one
of the hypotheses evoked to explain the expansion of
CHIKV transmission into new regions such as Madagascar [41] and Cameroon [11] in 2006, and India [8], Italy
[13] and Gabon [12] in 2007. Prior to these recent
CHIKV outbreaks, Ae. aegypti had been considered the
primary epidemic vector of CHIKV and Ae. albopictus, a
secondary vector. A single E1-A226V mutation was sufficient to increase the ability of CHIKV to infect Ae.
albopictus modifying the virus infectivity for a vector
species other than the typical Ae. aegypti vector.
Although the mutation confers a selective advantage in
Ae. albopictus, there was no corresponding advantage in
Ae. aegypti. Our results showed that Ae. aegypti Mayotte
was similarly susceptible to both viral strains, whereas
Ae. albopictus Mayotte and Ae. albopictus Reunion were
more susceptible to the CHIKV E1-226V than to the
CHIKV E1-226A strain (Figure 1). This may explain the
predominance of E1-226V in countries where Ae. albopictus is considered to be the main vector species. At a
titer of 107.5 PFU/mL, E1-226V virus was disseminated
more effectively by Ae. albopictus (Mayotte and
Reunion) than by Ae. aegypti (Mayotte). Infection of Ae.

aegypti Mayotte requires that the CHIKV blood-meal
titers are significantly higher than for infection of Ae.
albopictus (Mayotte and Reunion), which suggests that
once introduced, E1-226V would be positively selected
by Ae. albopictus.
As an intracellular parasite, CHIKV can mediate
changes in host life-history traits. Two sorts of mechanisms could be proposed. On one hand, the use of host
resources to maintain viral replication can lead to modifications of resource allocation as pathogenic effects. On
the other hand, life-history modifications may be
responses of the host to counterbalance the negative
effects of parasitism. By reacting to the parasite, the
host reduces the effect of infection on its fitness [42].
We have shown that replication of CHIKV in Aedes
mosquitoes is intensive, e.g. 1,000 more viral particles in
females from day 3 pi, and saliva became infectious
from two days pi [17]. In the present work, we have
analyzed the effects of CHIKV replication on several
life-history traits of Aedes mosquitoes related to
resource allocation, and only found significant modifications in Ae. albopictus from the Reunion Island. Thus
CHIKV infection has a significant effect on the time
until death and egg laying. Moreover, such negative
effects were independent of the viral strain: CHIKV E1226A and CHIKV E1-226V displayed similar effects.
Nevertheless, aside from CHIKV infection,Ae. albopictus
from the Reunion Island better survived in BSL-3
laboratory conditions than the two other mosquito
strains. Regardless, infection by CHIKV has a negative
impact on the survival of Ae. albopictus from the
Reunion Island (Figure 2C). Lifespan was shortened by
6-9 days when mosquitoes were infected with CHIKV
E1-226A or CHIKV E1-226V. Moreover, by shortening

circle’) mosquitoes were examined.

the time from blood-feeding to laying, CHIKV-infected
Ae. albopictus from the Reunion Island allocates an
increased reproduction investment to laying eggs before
death. Thus only limited consequences may affect vector
dynamics, as other factors dictating oviposition (the
number of eggs laid per mosquito) and hatching (the
proportion of females with at least one egg hatched and
hatching rate) characteristics were only slightly altered
by infection. Such earlier reproduction has been
reported in other animal-parasite systems [43,44].

Infection by a pathogen may modify resource distribution: infected hosts will allocate more resources to
reproduction, subtracting them from those attributed to
growth and survival [45,46]. Nevertheless, the question
remains as to why this phenomenon is not species-specific. Effectively, Ae. albopictus from Mayotte did not
exhibit the same pattern. One explanation could be that
Ae. albopictus assumed to be introduced into the
Reunion Island by immigrants from Asia in the 17th18 th centuries [47] has been subjected to major

Martin et al. BMC Ecology 2010, 10:8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/10/8

bottlenecks that cause strong genetic divergence from
the Asian mosquitoes [48]. Thus Ae. albopictus from the
Reunion Island may be genetically different from Ae.
albopictus detected in Mayotte in 2001 [35].
From our results, a very provocative scenario could be
envisioned concerning CHIKV evolution during the
Indian Ocean outbreak. Since Mayotte is located halfway
between Kenya, where the outbreak began, and the
Reunion Island, where the CHIKV E1-A226V was first
reported, this new variant could have already been present in Mayotte. In Mayotte, no data pertaining to
CHIKV sequences was available before 2006 and
CHIKV E1-226V was only identified after this time [15].
In Mayotte, both vectors co-exist [35] and we clearly
showed that Ae. aegypti Mayotte was similarly susceptible to both viral strains while Ae. albopictus Mayotte
was more susceptible to the CHIKV E1-226V strain.
The mutation could therefore be interpreted as a positive selection phenomenon for better transmission by
Ae. albopictus. In addition, we found that infection with
CHIKV E1-226A or CHIKV E1-226V did not induce
significant consequences on either species from
Mayotte. Nevertheless, on the Reunion Island, the
unique vector Ae. albopictus, maintains a better transmission of CHIKV E1-226V compared to CHIKV E1226A. However, an important decrease in the lifespan of
Ae. albopictus from the Reunion Island was reported as
a consequence of infection followed by changes in mosquito reproduction. We propose that CHIKV E1-226A
was maintained on Mayotte by both Ae. aegypti and Ae.
albopictus. Later, the introduction of CHIKV E1-226A
onto the Reunion Island where Ae. aegypti is rare,
would have led to the selection of the new variant by
Ae. albopictus. Since then, CHIKV E1-226V has invaded
some neighboring islands where Ae. albopictus is present. Thus, CHIKV E1-226V probably reached Mayotte
later, after having been selected in the Reunion Island.
In addition, the role of other mutations in the viral genome in the adaptation of CHIKV to Aedes mosquitoes
could not be completely excluded [49]. Furthermore,
some characteristics of the Ae. albopictus bio-ecology
might have favored CHIKV transmission in urban areas:
high anthropophily and high population densities.

Conclusion
Our results are in agreement with modifications in lifehistory traits reported for parasitized animals. We found
that the species Ae. albopictus was more susceptible to
the CHIKV E1-226V than to the CHIKV E1-226A strain
which assumes that once introduced, E1-226V would be
positively selected by Ae. albopictus. Nevertheless,
CHIKV infection only induced negative impacts on survival and on egg hatching characteristics of Ae. albopictus from the Reunion Island which led us to suggest

Page 9 of 13

that Ae. albopictus from the Reunion Island might be
less adapted to CHIKV than mosquitoes from Mayotte.
However, the physiological mechanisms underlying this
pattern are unknown. Nevertheless, the outcome of the
pathogen/host interaction often involves the immune
system that is restricted to the innate immune function
in insects. This is an effective mechanism to provide
protection against a wide variety of pathogens including
viruses. We have evaluated the number of viral RNA
copies in mosquitoes (live females sacrificed every day
and also dead females; see Figure 3) and found that
females that died a few days after infection did not host
more viral particles than did live females. Thus we
might suggest that mosquitoes did not die following an
excess of viral replication but more probably when
mounting an immune response. Modifications of lifehistory traits and/or mounting an efficient antiviral
response should be among strategies developed by the
vector to optimize its fitness.

Methods
Mosquitoes

Mosquitoes were from two islands in the Indian Ocean:
(i) Mayotte (Petite-Terre) where Ae. aegypti Mayotte
and Ae. albopictus Mayotte were collected in December
2006 and (ii) the Reunion Island (Providence) where Ae.
albopictus Reunion was collected in March 2007. In
Mayotte, Ae. albopictus was detected in 2000 [35] and
this is now the most frequent Aedes species encountered
in urban and suburban habitats on this island [38]. On
the Reunion Island, Ae. albopictus predominates in
urban settings, while Ae. aegypti is present as residual
non anthropophilic populations [33]. Experiments were
carried out with the 3rd, 6th and 2nd laboratory raised
generations for Ae. aegypti Mayotte, Ae. albopictus
Mayotte, and Ae. albopictus Reunion, respectively. Mosquitoes were maintained in insectariums at 28 ± 1°C
with 80% relative humidity and a 16 h:8 h photoperiod.
Batches of eggs were put to hatch and pools of 200 larvae were reared in pans containing 1 liter of water supplemented with 1-2 tablets of cat food. Only females
were used for oral infections. This rearing procedure
was used in order to obtain females of similar size, making them likely to take equal quantities of blood; this
was checked using a procedure for measuring bloodmeal size [50]. The females obtained were assumed to
ingest a similar number of viral particles [51,52]. Adults
were fed with a 10% sucrose solution until infection.
CHIKV strains

Two CHIKV strains were isolated from human sera of
patients on the Reunion Island: strain E1-226A was isolated in June 2005 and strain E1-226V in November
2005; these two strains differed mainly by a substitution

Martin et al. BMC Ecology 2010, 10:8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/10/8

of alanine by valine at position 226 of the E1 glycoprotein, in a region of the protein that is predicted to interact with the target membrane [15]. The two CHIKV
strains were provided by the French National Reference
Center for Arboviruses at the Institut Pasteur, which
had obtained the verbal consent from the patients who
provided blood sera. Stocks of both viral strains were
produced on Ae. albopictus C6/36 cells that were
infected at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 0.1 PFU
(plaque forming units)/cell for 48h at 27°C. Supernatant
fluids were collected and viral titers estimated by serial
10-fold dilutions on Vero cells. Each virus stock was
divided into aliquots and stored at -80°C until use.
Oral infections of mosquitoes

For each mosquito species, batches of 60 one-week-old
females were isolated in plastic boxes and starved for 24
hours before infection. Then they were allowed to feed
for 15 min through a chicken skin membrane, which covered the base of a feeder that contained the infectious
meal maintained at 37°C. The blood-meal was composed
of a virus suspension diluted (1:3) in washed rabbit erythrocytes with adenosine triphosphate (5 × 103 M).
Susceptibility of Aedes species to CHIKV strains

To determine the susceptibility of Ae. aegypti Mayotte
and Ae. albopictus (Mayotte and Reunion) to CHIKV E1226A and CHIKV E1-226V, we exposed batches of mosquitoes to a 10-fold dilution of viral stocks ranging from
104.5 to 108.5 PFU/mL. Only fully engorged mosquitoes
were transferred to small cardboard containers and maintained at 28°C for 14 days. At the end of this period when
optimal dissemination of the virus is obtained [16], mosquitoes that had survived were sacrificed and tested for
the presence of CHIKV by immunofluorescence assay
(IFA) on head squashes [53]. To this end, the head was
severed from the body, and sets of 10-15 heads were
placed on one slide. A second slide was placed on this to
squash the heads. Slides were then immersed in acetone
for 20 min at -20°C. Head squashes were incubated for
30 min at 37°C with a first anti-CHIKV antibody prepared from a mouse ascite diluted in PBS 1× (1:200).
After three washes in PBS 1×, the squashes were incubated with a goat anti-mouse conjugate diluted in PBS
1× (1:80) supplemented with Evans blue. Slides were
observed under an epifluorescence microscope. In replication-negative mosquitoes, the infection is limited to the
midgut and head tissues appear in red. In replicationpositive mosquitoes, the virus spreads beyond the midgut
and infects secondary organs including the salivary
glands. In such mosquitoes, the head tissues appear in
green. A significant correlation has been found between
the presence of virus in the head and the ability of a
female mosquito to excrete virus through saliva [17].

Page 10 of 13

Dissemination of the virus could be achieved within two
days. The disseminated infection rate corresponds to the
number of females with disseminated infection (mosquitoes with head tissues in green) among surviving females
14 days after an infectious meal.
Mosquito life-history traits

To determine whether infection by CHIKV has an
impact on mosquito life-history traits, other batches of
mosquitoes of each mosquito species were allowed to
feed on three different blood-meals: two infectious
blood-meals containing CHIKV E1-226A or CHIKV E1226V, and one non-infectious blood-meal that used Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium instead of the virus
suspension. Females selected at this stage had been inseminated by males after emergence in cages. The titer of
the infectious blood-meal was 107.5 PFU/mL [16]. Fully
engorged mosquitoes were individually isolated in 50
mL plastic tubes where a piece of wet cotton was placed
at the bottom as support for oviposition. Mosquitoes
maintained at 28°C were fed with a 10% sucrose solution until death. For each combination of CHIKV strain
and mosquito species, the experiment was conducted
twice; the number of mosquitoes considered in each
experiment was variable depending on the number of
engorged mosquitoes obtained.
For each mosquito, three traits were examined: survival, oviposition and egg hatching. Survival was evaluated
by scoring the number of dead mosquitoes every day, to
estimate mosquito lifespan. The infection status of each
mosquito was determined at the date of death by IFA
on head squashes: (i) a head found to be positive by IFA
corresponded to a mosquito with a disseminated infection (DINF) - after crossing the midgut, the virus had
disseminated inside the hemocele, colonizing different
organs including the central nervous system; (ii) a negative head according to IFA corresponded to a mosquito
with a non-disseminated infection (NDINF) - the virus
did not cross the midgut and was retained in the epithelium cells. All mosquitoes have ingested infectious viral
particles as ~105 PFU have been detected in engorged
females sacrified one hour after ingestion of the infectious blood-meal (data not shown). Non-infected mosquitoes named (NI) had ingested a non-infectious
blood-meal. Oviposition was examined according to
three parameters: (i) the time to first laying after the
blood-meal, which allows the duration of the gonotrophic cycle of each mosquito to be determined, (ii) the
total number of eggs laid per mosquito, (iii) the time
between the first oviposition and mosquito death.
Eggs were stored at 28°C until hatching. Hatching was
described by assessing two parameters: (i) the proportion of mosquitoes among those which have laid eggs
that have at least one egg hatched and (ii) the hatching

Martin et al. BMC Ecology 2010, 10:8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/10/8

rate, which corresponds to the proportion of eggs
hatched among those laid per mosquito. Eggs were put
to hatch by immersion in dechlorinated tap water in an
insectarium maintained at 28°C.
Quantitative RT-PCR

To determine whether mosquito mortality was related
to an over- replication of CHIKV, three living mosquitoes, and dead mosquitoes if present, were collected
every day. For each mosquito, the total RNA was
extracted using a nucleospin RNA II kit (MachereyNagel) according to the manufacturer’s instruction [16].
To construct the standard curve, a synthetic CHIKV
RNA transcript was generated. A PCR product containing the target region was prepared using CHIKV, and
this was cloned into the pCR II TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The product amplified using vector-specific primers was purified using a PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen).
RNA transcripts were produced in vitro using the RiboMAX™ Large Scale RNA Production System (Promega)
appropriate for either SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase. The
transcript size was 1,356 bp for both CHIKV E1-226A
and CHIKV E1-226V. Residual DNA was eliminated by
several DNAse treatments (Turbo DNA-free (Ambion)).
After quantification using a spectrophotometer, the
RNA transcript solution was stored at -80°C.
One-step quantitative RT-PCR was performed in a
volume of 25 μl containing 3 μl RNA template, 12.5 μl 2 ×
Brilliant SYBR Green I QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene), 1
μl sense (2.5 μM) and 1 μl anti-sense (2.5 μM) primers,
0.25 μl Fluorescein (1 μM), and 0.0625 μl Stratascript RT/
RNAse block enzyme. Primers were selected in the E2
structural protein regions: sense Chik/E2/9018/+
(CACCGCCGCAACTACCG) and anti-sense Chik/E2/
9235/- (GATTGGTGACCGCGGCA). The amplification
program in a i-Cycler TM (Biorad) included a reverse transcription step at 50°C for 30 min, an inactivation of RT/
RNAse enzyme step at 95°C for 10 min followed by 40
cycles of 95°C 30 s, 56°C 1 min, 72°C 30 s, a step at 95°C
for 1 min, and 81 cycles of 55°C (+0.5°C/cycle) 30 s. The
size of the amplification product was 217 bp. PCR was performed in triplicate for each mosquito. Signals were normalized to the standard curve obtained using serial
dilutions of synthetic RNA transcript. Normalized data
were used to measure the number of RNA copies in
infected mosquitoes according to ΔCt analysis. One Log of
PFU corresponds to 1-2 Log RNA virus (unpublished data).
Statistical analysis

For each mosquito species, disseminated infection rates
were compared according to CHIKV and viral titers
using a c2 test, the Fisher’s exact test being used in the
case of small sample sizes.

Page 11 of 13

The survival rate for each trial and each mosquito
species according to the virus (NI, CHIKV E1-226A
and CHIKV E1-226V) were described using KaplanMeier survival curves. These survival curves were then
compared using the logrank test. For each mosquito
species, the effects on survival of a 5-category covariate
that combines virus and infection status (NI, NDINF,
DINF) was investigated, after adjustment to the trial,
using an accelerated failure time model assuming that
the survival time was log-normally distributed. Time
ratios (95% confidence intervals) were estimated and
tested using Wald’s parametric test. This model was
chosen as the proportional assumption model required
by the more classical Cox model would not have been
valid.
For each mosquito species infected (or non-infected)
by a given virus, the time to the first egg laying was also
described using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and curves
were compared using the logrank test. We also
chronicled the time between the first oviposition and
mosquito death, using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and
compared these curves using the logrank test. Then, the
effect on the total number of eggs laid of the covariance
that combined virus and infection status (NI, NDINF,
DINF) was investigated using a negative binomial
regression model. This model is relevant when analyzing
incidence as it enables the control according to lifespan,
and it provides incidence rate ratios and their 95% confidence intervals. The significance level of the covariate
was tested using Wald’s test.
For each mosquito species, the hatching capacity was
studied through an assessment of the proportion of
mosquitoes with at least one hatched egg. The proportions of mosquitoes in each of the five categories
defined by virus and infection status were compared
using a Fisher’s exact test. Hatching rates, i.e. the proportion of hatched eggs among all eggs laid by a mosquito, were compared using analysis of variance,
according to virus and infection status.
All statistical analyses were performed using the
STATA software (StataCorp LP, Texas, USA).
