Abstract
Background: The Hemichordata comprises solitary-living Enteropneusta and colonial-living Pterobranchia, sharing
morphological features with both Chordata and Echinodermata. Despite their key role for understanding
deuterostome evolution, hemichordate phylogeny is controversial and only few molecular data are available for
phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, mitochondrial sequences are completely lacking for pterobranchs. Therefore,
we determined and analyzed the complete mitochondrial genome of the pterobranch Rhabdopleura compacta to
elucidate deuterostome evolution. Thereby, we also gained important insights in mitochondrial tRNA evolution.
Results: The mitochondrial DNA of Rhabdopleura compacta corresponds in size and gene content to typical
mitochondrial genomes of metazoans, but shows the strongest known strand-specific mutational bias in the
nucleotide composition among deuterostomes with a very GT-rich main-coding strand. The order of the proteincoding genes in R. compacta is similar to that of the deuterostome ground pattern. However, the protein-coding
genes have been highly affected by a strand-specific mutational pressure showing unusual codon frequency and
amino acid composition. This composition caused extremely long branches in phylogenetic analyses. The unusual
codon frequency points to a selection pressure on the tRNA translation system to codon-anticodon sequences of
highest versatility instead of showing adaptations in anticodon sequences to the most frequent codons.
Furthermore, an assignment of the codon AGG to Lysine has been detected in the mitochondrial genome of R.
compacta, which is otherwise observed only in the mitogenomes of some arthropods. The genomes of these
arthropods do not have such a strong strand-specific bias as found in R. compacta but possess an identical
mutation in the anticodon sequence of the tRNALys.
Conclusion: A strong reversed asymmetrical mutational constraint in the mitochondrial genome of Rhabdopleura
compacta may have arisen by an inversion of the replication direction and adaptation to this bias in the protein
sequences leading to an enigmatic mitochondrial genome. Although, phylogenetic analyses of protein coding
sequences are hampered, features of the tRNA system of R. compacta support the monophyly of Ambulacraria. The
identical reassignment of AGG to Lysine in two distinct groups may have occurred by convergent evolution in the
anticodon sequence of the tRNALys.

Background
Pterobranchia are a small, specialised group of marine suspension-feeding animals. Despite rich fossil record, only
some 20 extant species have been described, which are
subdivided into three genera, Rhabdopleura, Cephalodiscus
and Atubaria [1]. One questionable species from the genus
Atubaria (Atubaria heterolopha) is described, which lives
solitary [2]. Species of Rhabdopleura and Cephalodiscus
live in secreted tubes in colonies [1]. Although Pterobranchia comprise only few extant species, they represent an
important deuterostome lineage. Usually they are grouped
to the solitary-living Enteropneusta, forming together the
Hemichordata (e.g. [3]). Because the Hemichordata unite
features of the remaining two major deuterostome subgroups, Chordata and Echinodermata, the phylogenetic
position of Pterobranchia is crucial for understanding the
evolution of chordate and deuterostome body plans.
Despite their evolutionary importance, only ribosomal
sequence data were analysed for phylogenetic reconstruction of the pterobranchs [4-6]. These analyses support
the monophyly of Hemichordata and a close relationship
with Echinodermata, forming the Ambulacraria [7].
However, results within this group are conflicting. The
28S rDNA sequence analyses suggest reciprocal monophyly of Enteropneusta and Pterobranchia while the analyses of the 18S rDNA sequences support a branching of
Pterobranchia within Enteropneusta.
A frequently used molecular marker for reconstruction
of the phylogenetic relationships is the complete mitochondrial genome (e.g. [8-11]). The typical metazoan
mitochondrial genome is a circular DNA molecule ranging from 15 to 20 kb in size and comprises a more or
less conserved gene content of 13 protein-coding genes,
two ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes and 22 transfer RNA
(tRNA) genes [12]. The complete genomes allow phylogenetic analyses of both sequences and gene order. The
complete mitochondrial genomes are well characterised
from Vertebrata (e.g. [12]), Cephalochordata [9], Tunicata (e.g. [13]), and the five recent echinoderm subgroups
(e.g. [11]). The mitochondrial genome was also determined for the enigmatic worm-like Xenoturbella bocki
supporting a close relationship to Deuterostomia [10,14].
With the exception of the highly derived Tunicata, mitochondrial genomes of Deuterostomia are similar in architecture [8]. However, variability has been found in the
genetic code caused by different assignments of four
codons (AGA, AGG, AAA, and AUA). Since the
metazoan mitochondrial translation system comprises a
reduced tRNA gene set of usually 22 tRNA genes, each
tRNA gene has to recognize different codons (usually
two or four codons), which often differ only in the 3rd
codon site. The influence of the 3 rd codon site on the
translation efficiency is still under discussion [15-22].

The “theory of anticodon sequences with highest versatility” postulates that the anticodon sequence of a tRNA
gene pairs equally effectively with all recognized codons
[15,16,18]. Alternatively, the “theory of codon-anticodon
adaptation” suggests that the anticodon sequence of a
tRNA gene is adapted to the most frequent codon among
all the recognized codons [19,20]. As most metazoan
mitochondrial genomes show an AT-rich main-coding
strand [23], the tRNAs preferentially have GNN anticodons for NNY codons, UNN for NNR codons, and also
UNN for the four-fold degenerate codon families [19,20].
This is in congruence with both theories (see [17]). The
strand-specific nucleotide bias may have arisen by the
asymmetrical replication of the circular mitochondrial
genome which exposes stretches of a DNA strand for a
longer time as single-stranded than other parts, accumulating Adenine and Guanine nucleotides more faster
[23-28]. However, some mitochondrial genomes possess
an inverse strand-specific mutational pattern showing a
GT-rich main-coding strand, e.g. Branchiostomia
(Cephalochordata) and Crinoidea (Echinodermata),
which is usually explained by an inversion of the replication direction of the mtDNA [23,29].
In contrast to these well characterized genomes, only
three enteropneust genomes are known from Hemichordata. The two Balanoglossus genomes exhibit similarities
to Vertebrata and Echinodermata [30]. The analyses of the
genetic code suggest assignments as found in Echinodermata, although two important codons are missing (AAA
and AAG) [31]. The genome of the enteropneust Saccoglossus kowalevskii was not described in detail, but the published annotated sequence shows a derived gene order and
a different assignment of the codon AAA compared to the
echinoderm genetic code (AAA ≠ Asn; NC_007438). However, this assignment in the genome of S. kowalevskii
(AAA = Lys) also occurs in other invertebrate mtDNAs.
We determined the first mitochondrial genome of a
pterobranch, Rhabdopleura compacta, and compared the
genome architecture and the genetic code to other deuterostome and metazoan genomes. The genome of
R. compacta shows an unusual strand-specific bias, which
strongly affected the protein sequences, and suggests an
inversion of the replication direction. This precluded the
phylogenetic reconstruction of Deuterostomia including
Pterobranchia by protein sequence analyses. The order of
protein-coding genes of R. compacta is similar to the
hypothetical ancestral arrangement of deuterostomes but
is also not informative for phylogenetic reconstruction
within the Deuterostomia. The codon-anticodon distribution and the codon assignments in the pterobranch
genome reject an adaptation of anticodon sequences to
the most frequent codons, but give strong support for
selection to an efficient tRNA translation system with

anticodon sequences showing highest versatility. Features
of its tRNA system support the grouping of Ambulacraria
(Echinodermata and Hemichordata).

Results and Discussion
General Features of the Mitochondrial Genome of
Rhabdopleura compacta

The mitochondrial genome of R. compacta comprises a
15,814 bp long circular DNA molecule with a slightly
higher AT-content (66%) than enteropneust genomes (52
- 60%). It shows one of the strongest strand-specific biases
of metazoan genomes with high amounts of Thymine
(48%) and Guanine (23%) but low amounts of Adenine
(18%) and Cytosine (11%) on the main-coding strand causing strong negative AT- and positive GC-skews (Figure 1).
The main-coding strand bears several oligoT-stretches
with lengths of six (48 times), seven (38 times), eight (19
times) and nine nucleotides (10 times), while the longest
stretch of 13 T’s is found only once. The large amount of
Thymine leads to a higher total AT-content, although
the GT-content is also markedly increased in all Rhabdopleura mt genes compared to closely related taxa (Table 1).
The genome contains all genes typical for Metazoa, i.e.,
13 protein-coding, two rRNA, and 22 tRNA genes
(Figure 2). All protein-coding genes start with ATG or
GTG and end with a complete stop-codon with the
exception of COX3 and ND4. Both genes overlap with
downstream tRNA genes suggesting an incomplete

termination codon “T” as described in Ojala et al. [32].
The ATP8 protein is unusual: about 20 residuals of the
C-terminus are missing. In contrast, additional parts
within the protein sequences are detected within ATP6
(about 50 aa) and ND3 (about 28 aa). All protein-coding
genes are located on the same strand and furthermore,
the strand-specific nucleotide skews are predominantly
found in protein-coding genes (Figure 1 and 2). Moreover, the oligoT-stretches are frequently located in protein-coding regions. The longest T-stretch is located
within the coding-region of COX3 leading to four phenylalanine residues in series within an evolutionary conserved phenylalanine-rich domain.
The 22 tRNA genes have been identified based on the
predicted cloverleaf secondary structure. The increased
GT-content has also been observed in the rRNA and, to
a lesser extent, in the tRNA genes (Table 1). The two
rRNA genes have been detected by alignments. Their
boundaries have been recovered only for the 12S rRNA,
whereas the 16S rRNA has been determined by the
flanking tRNA genes. The 12S rRNA is 842 bp in size
and similar to the 12S rRNA of the enteropneusts (815
bp - 851 bp) showing 41 - 42% sequence identities. The
16S rRNA (≤1,342 bp) is much shorter than the enteropneust sequences (1,498 bp - 1,504 bp) but exhibits 41 42% sequence identity with them. The exact ends of the
16S rRNA is uncertain, the gene is possibly surrounded
by short UAS (unassigned sequences).

Surprisingly, only 1% of the genome consists of UAS
and there is no large UAS region at all. The longest
UAS region spans 24 bp and is located between the
ATP6 and ND6 genes (Figure 2).
Strand-specific Nucleotide Biases

Almost all metazoan mitochondrial genomes present
obvious strand-specific AT- and GC-skews (Figure 1)
which is usually explained by the (asymmetrical) stranddisplacement mechanisms inherent in the replication of
mitogenomes [23]. Vertebrate genomes present pronounced AT- and GC-skews on the two strands having
an AC-rich main-coding strand (Figure 1) (e.g. [25]).
This strand-specific mutational bias is explained by the
asymmetrical replication. Replication starts from two
distinct replication initiation sites for the GT-rich
(heavy) strand (oriH) and the AC-rich (light) strand
(oriL) [24,25], respectively. While the replication of the
genome starts on oriH, the replication of the light
strand starts later on oriL, when the replication fork
from oriH has passed this point [24]. The two strands
are therefore single-stranded for different lengths of
time. In mammalian genomes, the oriL is located 2/3
apart from the oriH exposing always the same strand as
single-stranded. Further, the time of the single-stranded
state increases from the oriH to the oriL showing shortest time on oriL, longest time of single-stranded on
oriH and long time of single-stranded in the remaining

1/3 part [24]. The faster accumulation of Guanine and
Thymine nucleotides in single-stranded DNA then leads
to the observed strand-specific AT- and GC-skews
[23-27].
However, investigations on mammalian mtDNAs suggest possible alternative L-strand syntheses [33-35] or
additional replication modes, which might be tissue- or
stage-specific [36-40]. These could substantially reduce
the time of single-stranded compared to the conventional strand-displacement mode.
The strand specific accumulations of the Guanine and
Thymine nucleotides in the genome of R. compacta show
typical mutational pattern as proposed by the strand-displacement mode. In particular, the (G + T)/(A + C) ratios
in protein-coding sequences shows a gradient along the
genome of R. compata (Figure 2) in congruence with the
conventional strand-displacement mode. The lowest
(G + T)/(A + C) ratios are found between the genes ND5
and CYTB, suggesting that the oriL is located in this
region since the shortest time of single-strandedness
should cause the lowest bias. The (G + T)/(A + C) ratios
increase from CYTB to ND2, while high ratios are recovered between ND2 and ND5 (Figure 2). The high ratios
suggest that oriH is located close to the end of the ND2
gene. Both oriL and oriH have to be expected within
genes because large unassigned sequences (UAS) that
could contain regulatory elements are missing in the genome of R. compacta.

Assuming that there are competing modes of replication for metazoan mitogenomes, the extreme strand
specific nucleotide bias in R. compacta might indicate
that the strand-displacement mode is more dominant
than in closely related species. However, the basal protostome clades Platyhelminthes and Chromodorea exhibit
a similarly strong strand specific nucleotide bias as
R. compacta (Figure 1), and similar replication modes
might be used in these taxa.
The strand specific mutational bias in R. compacta is
inverted on the main-coding strand compared to most
other deuterostome genomes (Figure 1). This may be
explained by an inversion of the direction of replication
which has been described for Crinoidea [29], a subgroup
of the echinoderms, and several other, unrelated taxa
[23]. Only few gene inversions are found in the genome
of R. compacta compared to genomes of Vertebrata (the
ND6 and five tRNA genes) or to the enteropneust Balanoglossus (the ND6 and six tRNA genes) suggesting that
the inversion of regulatory elements lead to the inverted
replication direction.
Genetic Code and the tRNA System

All codons are present in the protein-coding genes of
R. compacta, including the codons TAA and TAG as stop
codons. Most assignments of the amino acid codons could
be determined on conserved sites within a metazoan alignment using GenDecoder v1.6 [41], whereas five codon

assignments could be recovered only with weak support
(Table 2). Two of them could be well determined based
on weakly conserved or variable sites: UCC (46% Ser) and
AAA (69% Lys, no Asn) while only uncertain results were
obtained for the codons AUC, UGC, and CUC. However,
the codons AUC and UGC present the reverse complement of the anticodon sequence of the tRNAIle/GAU and
the tRNACys/GCA, which support the assignment as Ile and
Cys, respectively (Table 2). The CUC codon specifies 27%
as Ile, 24% as Phe, and 23% as Leu. Due to the assignment
of CUC as Leu in all bilaterian genetic codes deposited in
NCBI database, this assignment was also assumed for
R. compacta (Table 2).
The codon usage in the mitochondrial genome of
R. compacta shows a strong preference of synonymous
codons ending with Thymine or Guanine (Figure 1 and
Table 2), which is in contrast to most vertebrate
mtDNAs [17]. Moreover, the nucleotide composition of
the tRNA genes is adapted to the increased GT-content
(Table 1), but most anticodons of the tRNA genes still
show the typical sequence of other metazoan genomes
[19,20] having anticodons GNN for NNY codons, UNN
for NNR codons and also UNN for four-fold degenerate
codon families (Table 2). Therefore, the reverse complements of the anticodon sequences show usually the low
frequent codons (Table 2) rejecting an adaptation of the
anticodon sequences to most frequent codons (see [17]).
In contrast, this strongly supports that an effective

The total number of codons is shown. The assignment of each codon was detected within a metazoan alignment using GenDecoder server v1.6 [41]. The reverse
complements of the anticodons are marked by asterisks, deviations from the versatility rule [15,16,18] are underlined. One codon (question mark) could not be
determined with certainty.

translation system is based on anticodon sequences of
tRNA genes with highest versatility to all recognized
codons independent of their frequency [15,16,18].
Three deviations from the anticodon system with such
highest versatility are found in the genome of R. compacta
(Table 2) which are also recovered in some other deuterostome genomes and which are all correlated to codons
with different assignments (Table 3).
(i) The anticodon sequence for Met is derived as it
shows the reverse complement to the AUG codon instead
of the AUA codon. This is found in most metazoan genomes and may be important for an effective translation of
the start codon AUG (see [17]). The AUA codon shows
different assignments within Deuterostomia. In all Echinodermata, the three Enteropneusta and in R. compacta, the
AUA codon is assigned as Ile (Table 3) while it encodes
Met in Chordata (Urochordata, Cephalochordata, and
Vertebrata). Since no change in the anticodon of the
tRNAIle is found, the additional recognition of the AUA
codon by the tRNAIle should be based on other mechanisms which may have arisen in the lineage leading to the
Ambulacraria.
(ii) The tRNA Ser/GCU shows also no changes in the
anticodon sequences within Deuterostomia and recognises the AGT and AGC (AGY) codons within highest
versatility. Due to the missing of a tRNA gene for the
codons AGA and AGG (AGR), these codons are partially
also recognised by tRNASer/GCU. The pairing of the anticodon sequence of tRNASer/GCU to the codon AGA may
be possible under special conditions; whereas the recognition of the AGG codon is assumed to be more complicated [15,42]. Within Deuterostomia, only the genomes
of Echinodermata show obviously an assignment of Ser
for all four codons. The pairing of the AGG codon to the
tRNASer/GCU in echinoderms is explained by a guanosine

methylation on the anticodon sequence that enables this
pairing [42,43]. The genomes of Chordata and Tunicata
possess a different assignment of both codons (AGG and
AGA) which is based on an additional tRNA gene for Gly
in Tunicata [44] and a unique pathway to recognize these
codons as stop codons in Chordata [45,46]. In the genome of R. compacta, the codon AGA assigns Ser while
the codon AGG is reassigned to Lys (Table 3).
(iii) The assignment of the codon AGG as Lys is supported for the genome of Rhabdopleura by eight highly
conserved sites (83% with Lys) and two weakly conserved
sites (63% with Lys), but has not been detected in other
deuterostome mtDNAs. However, several taxa within
Arthropoda also have an assignment of AGG for Lys. All
these genomes and the genome of R. compacta present
an unusual anticodon sequence of tRNALys showing the
sequence “CUU” instead of “UUU” (Table 3) [47]. Only
the second codon position of the codon AGG mismatches to the anticodon sequence tRNA Lys/CUU and
may enable the codon reassignment to Lys. Notably, the
arthropod lineage shows also mtDNAs with tRNALys/CUU
or tRNALys/UUU but missing the reassignment. The distributions of the anticodon sequences within arthropods
suggest an ancestral mutation in the tRNALys but could
not support (but also not reject) an ancestral assignment
of AGG as Lys [47]. Therefore, several independent backmutations to the usual anticodon sequence “UUU” and
several reassignments of AGG to Lys may have occurred
[47]. Similar to this, the genomes of Echinodermata and
the enteropneust Balanoglossus spp. have also the derive
anticodon sequence “CUU” while the genome of the
enteropneust Saccoglossus shows the usual anticodon
sequence of “UUU” (Table 3). All these genomes lack the
reassignment of AGG to Lys. Furthermore, the translation efficiency for the codon AAA by the tRNA Lys/CUU

could be reduced due to deviation from the highest versatility in the 3rd codon site (anticodon sequence changed
to “C” instead of “U” in the first site) and may have
caused the lack of the AAA codons in the genomes of
Balanoglossus [30] as well as the reassignment of the
codon AAA to Asn in echinoderms [48]. The recognition
of the codon AAA by the tRNAAsn/GUU in echinoderm
genomes may be based on a further mutation on position
33 in the anticodon loop of the tRNAAsn [31,48] which is
missing in pterobranch and enteropneust genomes
(Table 3).
In summary, the distribution of the tRNALys anticodon
sequence within Deuterostomia and the reassignments of
the codon AAA (in Echinodermata) and AGG
(R. compacta) suggest a tRNALys/CUU as an apomorphic
character for the taxon Ambulacraria (Table 3). Furthermore, our data support the codon reassignments as a
two-step-process: The first step was the reduced recognition in mtDNAs of Ambulacraria as a consequence of a
mutation in tRNALys/CUU abandoning AAA and the lack
of a suitable tRNA for codon AGG. These reductions
paved the way for adaptations in two other tRNAs to
recognize these codons: AGG by tRNALys/CUU in R. compacta and AAA by tRNAAsn/GUU in Echinodermata. Both
steps were forced by an effective translation system in
congruence to the “Modified Ambiguous Intermediate
Theory of Codon Reassignment” [49-51]. The alternative
“Codon Capture Hypothesis of Codon Reassignment”
[52] assumes mutational pressure in the first step leading
to codon losses in the genome. This seems to be unlikely
because the genome of R. compacta presents a strong
mutational bias in all protein-coding genes, but no codon
is missing.

Protein-Coding Genes

The GT nucleotide composition has an important influence on the protein composition of nuclear genomes
[53]. Similarly, the mutational bias in the genome of
R. compacta strongly influences the protein sequences,
even if highest GT-bias is detected in the third codon
position (Figure 1). The GT-rich main-coding strand of
R. compacta exhibits all protein-coding genes showing an
increase of GT-rich codons at the expense of AC-rich
codons. This leads to unusual amino acid composition in
all proteins (Figure 3). The abundance is increased for
Phe, Gly, Val, Trp which all are encoded by exclusively
GT-rich codons (Figure 3). In contrast, the amino acids
Thr, Pro, Asn, His, and Gln are decoded solely by ACrich codons and are decreased in their abundances in the
proteins of R. compacta compared to the proteins of closely related species (Figure 3).
This strong bias within the amino acid sequence hampered the phylogenetic analyses of the protein-coding
genes leading to extreme long branch lengths (Figure 4).

ML/Mr.Bayes

Figure 4 Maximum likelihood tree of the major deuterostome
groups excluding tunicates using the amino acid sequences of
all thirteen mitochondrial protein-coding genes. The numbers
on the nodes show the bootstrap percentages (BP) for ML and the
posterior probabilities (PP) of the Bayesian analyses in this order.
Asterisks indicate highest support values. The numbers in
parenthesis behind the deuterostome groups show the number of
analyzed species. The length of the triangles for each group
indicates the variability within the group. The extreme long branch
leading to the pterobranch R. compacta is based on its highly
different protein-composition compared to other deuterostome
sequences (for details see text).

Perseke et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:134
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/134

Both ML and the Bayesian approaches resulted in a
meaningless sistergroup relationship of R. compacta to
the echinoderm subgroup Ophiuroidea, hence rejecting
a monophyletic Echinodermata and Hemichordata (Figure 4). While the monophyly of Echinodermata is well
supported by several other analyses [6], the mitochondrial genomes of Ophiuroidea show an accelerated evolutionary rate [11,54,55]. Thus, the grouping of R.
compacta and Ophiuroidea most likely is caused by a
long branch artefact due to the unusual protein composition. However, the protein composition of R. compacta
suggests a long time of adaptive evolution under the
same mutational pressure.
Gene Order Evolution

The mtDNAs of most deuterostome groups show similar
gene arrangements, especially the order of the proteincoding genes. The consensus gene order of vertebrate
genomes is assumed to represent the ancestral arrangement for Deuterostomia, if not for Metazoa [8]. Only the
genomes of Tunicata show unique gene arrangements
(including two additionally tRNA genes) featuring all
genes on one strand and having unusual high rearrangement rates within the group (e.g. [13]). The mitochondrial genome of R. compacta presents a new gene
arrangement showing high differences in the tRNA and
rRNA gene order compared to the assumed ancestral
deuterostome as well as to the known hemichordate
arrangements (Additional file 1, Figure S1).
With regard to the order of the protein-coding genes
the arrangement of Balanoglossus (identical to Xenturbella bocki) appears to represent the ancestral state
within Hemichordata, since only one translocation of
CYTB or ND6 from the vertebrate/cephalochordate
arrangement has to be hypothesized (Figure 5).
Within Hemichordata, two rearrangements are necessary to interconvert the basal Balanoglossus gene order
into that of Saccoglossus kovalewskii (the inversion of
COX1, and the transposition of either ND1 or ND2). The
gene order of R. compacta needs three steps to be derived
from the ancestral Balanoglossus order (inversion of
ND6, translocation of COX3, and transposition of the
fragment containing ND1 and ND2) (Figure 5). However,
these rearrangements have to be addressed as autapomorphies and thus, no synapomorphic characters could
be detected in gene order evolution within Hemichordata, which would allow phylogenetic reconstruction
within the group.
Notably, the gene order of R. compacta can be derived
directly from the assumed basal deuterostome arrangement (Vertebrata) by the same number of three rearrangements, which however would render Hemichordata
paraphyletic (Figure 5).

Page 8 of 12

Although the ancestral arrangement of the fragment
containing ND1 and ND2 cannot be surely determined
[11], the echinoderm genomes show an apomorphic
translocation of the ND4L gene, which is not recovered
in any other deuterostome genome (Figure 5).

Conclusion
The unusual mitochondrial genome of R. compacta features a strong, reversed asymmetrical mutational constraint compared to most other deuterostome genomes.
This may have arisen by an inversion of the replication
direction in the lineage leading to R. compacta and by an
adaptation to this bias in the protein sequences. Due to
this bias, phylogenetic analyses of protein-coding genes
failed. However, the tRNA system supports the monophyly
of Ambulacraria, comprising Hemichordata and Echinodermata by the synapomorphic characters tRNALys/CUU
and the assignment of ATA as Ile. The strong strand-specific mutational bias in the genome of R. compacta allows
further important insights in the evolution of the tRNA
system. The observed codon usage and their anticodon
sequences strongly support a selection pressure to an efficient translation system possessing anticodon sequences
which pair most easily with all recognized codons, independent of their frequency (anticodons with highest versatility) similar to most tRNA genes of fungal mtDNAs [15].
Mutations in the anticodon sequence changing the recognition efficiency could lead to a bias in the codon distributions and could cause the deletion of codons from the
genome. Furthermore, similar mutations in the anticodon
sequence could cause similar adaption processes in the
tRNA translation system as found in the convergent
assignment of AGG as Lys in the genome of R. compacta
and some arthropod genomes. Our analyses support
the disappearance and reassignment of codons in response
to a selection pressure for an efficient translation system
as described in the “Modified Ambiguous Intermediate
Theory of Codon Reassignment” [49-51].
Methods
DNA Extraction, Amplification, Sequencing and
Annotation

About 50 adult zooids of Rhabdopleura compacta Hincks,
1880 were dissected from their coenecia, which were
attached to disarticulated shells of Glycymeris glycymeris,
dredged off from Stoke Point (near Plymouth, UK, 50°
17’N, 4°01’W) in Mai 2006 from a depth of 21-24 m.
Genomic DNA was extracted using phenol - chloroform
extraction, following proteinase K digestion. The complete
mitochondrial genome was amplified using two overlapping fragments. The first fragment was amplified with the
specific primer pair GTGGTGGAGTACCCTTTTAAGACTG and GACCCAATAGTTGAAGCATGATGCC,

which was determined from the COX1 sequences that we
found in our Rhabdopleura EST (M. Perseke et al., unpublished). The second fragment was amplified with the specific primer pair GTTTACTTTGGGGGGTTGCACTGG
and CCAACGCTCAATCAGCTTCAAGAGC, which was
designed based on the first COX1 fragment sequenced.
The PCR reactions were performed with a Mastercycler
machine (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). The
cycling was set up with an initial denaturing step at 94°C
for 3 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of denaturing at 94°C
for 60 seconds, annealing at 60°C for 30 seconds and elongation at 68°C for 5 minutes.
The 25 μl PCR reaction amounted 0.3U of the Phusion
High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo,

Finland) and 0.3 ng DNA as well as 5 μl 5× Phusion GC
buffer (Finnzymes), 2.5 μl dNTP mix (10 mM each) and
1 μl of forward and reverse primers, respectively (10 μM
each). The PCR product of the large fragment was
sequenced by primer walking as described by Perseke
et al. [54]. Additional starting points for faster primer
walking were obtained by preparing a “mini” DNA library
using four-cutter restriction enzymes and the pGem-T
plasmid Vector (Promega). All PCR products were
sequenced directly on an ABI 3100 automated sequencer
(Applied Biosystems) using the BigDye Termination v3.1
Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). After concatenating the sequences to the complete genome, all protein-coding genes and the rRNA genes were identified by

Perseke et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:134

alignments. All tRNA genes were identified by using the
tRNAscan-SE 1.23 server [56]. The entire mitochondrial
DNA sequence was submitted to the GenBank under the
accession number FN908482.
Analysis of Nucleotide Composition and the Genetic Code

The strand biases of the main-coding strand, given as
the AT-skew [(A-T)/(A + T)] and the GC-skew [(G-C)/
(G + C)] [57], were calculated using an automatic tool
developed for this purpose for both the complete genome of R. compacta and all complete mitogenomes
available in NCBI RefSeq 41 [58]. In addition, the ATand GC-skews were computed separately excluding protein-coding sequences and further using only the 3 rd
codon positions of the protein-coding genes of R.
compacta.
The values of the (T + G)/(C + A) ratios were determined for each position in the genome of R. compacta
using a window starting 149 positions to the left and
ending 150 positions to the right.
The genetic code of the R. compacta genome was predicted by evaluating four different degrees of conserved
codons (highly conserved, conserved, weakly conserved and
variable sites) in the alignment of 56 metazoan sequences
implemented in the GenDecoder server v1.6 [41].
Analysis of Gene Order

The genome rearrangements were studied using the webbased CREx software [59]. The gene order of R. compacta
was compared to the following deuterostome genomes:
both Balanoglossus species [11,30]; Saccoglossus kowalevskii (NC_007438), Xenoturbella bocki [10,14], the
putative ancestral arrangement in Echinodermata [11],
the consensus gene order of Vertebrata [12], the ancestral
order of Cephalochordata [9] and all known gene orders
of Tunicata [13]. Further, the gene order was compared
to Platyhelminthes [60], and Nematoda [61]. All comparisons were performed twice - with and without - the
tRNA and rRNA genes.
Phylogenetic Analyses of Protein-Coding Sequences

The phylogenetic analyses of the protein-coding genes
were carried out by adding the R. compacta protein
sequences to the taxon set “Deuterostomia” from Perseke
et al. [11]. All protein-coding genes were aligned separately using the T-Coffee server with the default parameter
set [62]. The sequences were then truncated, so that no
genes started and ended with a gap. Finally, they were concatenated. The “mtRev” model of amino acids was selected
and the gamma shape parameter and the proportion of
invariable sites were determined using PhyML v.2.4.4 [63].
The Maximum Likelihood (ML) analyses were carried out
with PhyML v.2.4.4 [63] using the determined parameters
and six categories of substitution rates. The robustness of

Page 10 of 12

bifurcations was estimated with bootstrap analyses (100
replicates). The Bayesian analyses were performed with
MrBayes v.3.1.2 [64] using the determined parameters and
six categories of substitution rates. The calculation was
run for 1,000,000 generations, with a sampling frequency
of 10 generations and burn-in of the first 25,000 trees. The
remaining trees were tested for stability of the likelihood
values and used to compute the posterior probabilities.
