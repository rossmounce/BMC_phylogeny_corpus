Abstract
Background: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes that exhibit presence/absence
variation have provided informative marker sets for bacterial and viral genotyping. Identification of
marker sets optimised for these purposes has been based on maximal generalized discriminatory
power as measured by Simpson's Index of Diversity, or on the ability to identify specific variants.
Here we describe the Not-N algorithm, which is designed to identify small sets of genetic markers
diagnostic for user-specified subsets of known genetic variants. The algorithm does not treat the
user-specified subset and the remaining genetic variants equally. Rather Not-N analysis is designed
to underpin assays that provide 0% false negatives, which is very important for e.g. diagnostic
procedures for clinically significant subgroups within microbial species.
Results: The Not-N algorithm has been incorporated into the "Minimum SNPs" computer
program and used to derive genetic markers diagnostic for multilocus sequence typing-defined
clonal complexes, hepatitis C virus (HCV) subtypes, and phylogenetic clades defined by
comparative genome hybridization (CGH) data for Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica and
Clostridium difficile.
Conclusion: Not-N analysis is effective for identifying small sets of genetic markers diagnostic for
microbial sub-groups. The best results to date have been obtained with CGH data from several
bacterial species, and HCV sequence data.

Background
The last two decades have seen an exponential increase in
the generation of comparative genetic data from within
bacterial and viral species. Many of the bacterial data sets
are derived from electrophoresis-based genotyping methods, such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, which has
been used to develop the inter-laboratory PulseNet system

for real-time monitoring of foodborne bacterial pathogens [1]. More recently, databases of defined genetic polymorphisms have become available. Conspicuous
examples are multilocus sequence typing (MLST) databases [2,3], the results of comparative genome hybridization (CGH) studies on bacteria [4-7], and whole-genome
sequence databases for bacteria and viruses [8-12].

The extensive knowledge base of comparative genetic
information can be exploited to develop rationallydesigned genotyping methods for examining epidemiology, or inferring virulence potential, vaccine susceptibility
or antimicrobial-antiviral resistance. One approach to discriminating known genotypes within a species is to interrogate every known genetic polymorphism. However, this
approach is inefficient due to linkage of alleles, and may
also provide more resolving power than is required [13].
Despite considerable improvements in nucleic acid analysis technology in recent years, there remains a need for
cost-effective and rapid genotyping methods that interrogate small sets of polymorphisms and provide the
required information in an efficient manner [14]. Such
methods have potential applications in infection control,
point-of-care diagnosis, high-throughput public health
investigations, food microbiology and biodefense. Suitable emerging technology platforms for such marker sets
include real-time PCR [15], medium-density arrays [16],
and more recently 'lab-on-a-chip' devices [17,18].
The considerable volume of comparative genetic information now available renders computerized data-mining the
only practical means of identifying sets of polymorphisms
optimized for particular genotyping tasks. Our research
group has previously developed and described the "Minimum SNPs" computer program, which extracts resolution-optimized single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
sets from complex DNA sequence alignments [19]. Previously described capabilities of "Minimum SNPs" included
the identification of SNP sets that discriminated a single
sequence variant from all other know variants (the '%'
mode), and the identification of SNP sets that maximize
Simpson's Index of Diversity (D), and are therefore optimized with respect to discriminating all variants from
each other [19,20]. The % module has been applied to the
identification of highly informative SNPs that define specific Neisseria meningitidis and Staphylococcus aureus variants [19], while the D module has been used to extract Dmaximized SNP sets from S. aureus and Campylobacter
jejuni MLST databases [21-23], and, more recently, to
derive D-maximized binary gene sets (sets of genes that
are present in some isolates but not others) from C. jejuni
CGH data [24].
Other bioinformatics programs that carry out similar
functions to "Minimum SNPs" include a linkage disequilibrium-selection algorithm, which identifies SNPs diagnostic for haplotype blocks in mammalian genomes [13],
and SNPT, which also incorporates a D maximization
module [25]. One function notably absent from previous
versions of "Minimum SNPs" and similar programs is the
ability to identify sets of genetic markers that discriminate
a user-defined group of variants from all other known variants. Such a function could underpin genotyping meth-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/278

odologies designed to identify all variants within a species
that possess specific traits of interest, such as increased virulence or resistance properties. There are several considerations when designing such an algorithm, such as
conversion of the user-defined group of sequence variants
into a consensus sequence, and scoring of the resolving
power of genetic marker sets. Here we report a novel algorithm for identifying such genetic marker sets, and its
application to the analysis of microbial and viral comparative genetic data.

Results and Discussion
MLST datasets
The clonal complexes (CCs) defined by MLST data are
emerging as important epidemiological or taxonomic
units [14,26]. Therefore it was investigated whether NotN analysis could identify diagnostic SNPs for major CCs
of a variety of bacterial species. In E. coli, two independent
MLST schemes were examined. Using scheme 1, Not-N
analysis successfully identified 15 SNPs that completely
differentiated the 10 major CCs (see additional file 1).
The second E. coli MLST scheme, which contains a larger
cohort of isolates than scheme 1, required 24 SNPs to differentiate the 12 major CCs. Not-N analysis was unable to
completely differentiate the largest CC, with eight SNPs
resolving 98.5% of the out-group from the group of interest. Not-N analysis of the H. influenzae MLST dataset identified 24 SNPs that differentiated the seven major CCs
from the remaining ST population (results not shown).

In contrast to H. influenzae and E. coli, Not-N analysis was
unable to identify high-confidence SNPs (≥ 98%) for four
S. aureus and five C. jejuni CCs. These CCs were the largest
in their respective databases. The difficulty in identifying
SNPs diagnostic for the larger CCs was investigated further
and was found to be due to CC members that have
diverged from the CC founders by recombination rather
than mutation. S. aureus exhibits a low recombination frequency, with approximately 10% of CC members arising
by recombination [27]. While mutation predominantly
generates single novel SNPs, recombinants acquire a preexisting allele from elsewhere in the species. The large
pool of alleles present in the larger CCs increases the probability that one or more alleles per locus have arisen by
recombination with a pre-existing allele. Given that most
S. aureus SNPs are dimorphic, coupled with the effects of
recombination and the small pool of available SNPs in S.
aureus sequence data, there exist few SNPs unique to all
members of a CC. Therefore, the probability of finding
highly discriminatory SNP sets is low. In support of this,
the Not-N algorithm was used to find sets of SNPs diagnostic for the 212 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)
STs in the MLST database [28]. The MRSA dataset is
smaller than the complete S. aureus MLST database, and
therefore the CCs contain correspondingly fewer recom-

binants. This analysis yielded 22 SNPs that delineated the
ten major MRSA CCs with 100% confidence (results not
shown).
In C. jejuni, the influence of recombination on Not-N performance is similar to S. aureus but is more extreme. The
majority of STs in C. jejuni arise by recombination, at an
estimated frequency of 50 times the rate of mutation [29],
resulting in an even smaller probability of identifying CCspecific SNPs. SNP sets diagnostic for S. aureus CCs are
more efficiently derived using the D maximization algorithm of "Minimum SNPs", while in C. jejuni, the high
recombination rate renders the identification of small
numbers of CC-specific SNPs with high discriminatory
power and a low false-negative rate potentially impossible
by any means. Other researchers have identified small
numbers of C. jejuni CC SNPs characteristic of six major
CCs of C. jejuni; ST-21, ST-45, ST-48, ST-61, ST-206 and
ST-257 [14]. However, these SNPs result in a high proportion (between 17 and 54%) of false-negative STs, and may
therefore be unsuitable for certain genotyping applications.
The "Minimum SNPs" software has previously been used
to derive D-optimized (diversity maximizing) SNP sets
from the S. aureus and C. jejuni databases [21-23]. In the
case of S. aureus, the genotypes defined by approximately
eight D-optimized SNPs correspond closely to the population structure as defined by eBURST analysis. Thus, the
D-optimized SNP sets appear superior to the Not-N
derived SNP sets for assigning an S. aureus isolate to a CC.
In the case of C. jejuni, the correspondence between Doptimized SNP genotypes and population structure is less
than in S. aureus because of the higher recombination frequency. However, adding the interrogation of more loci
such as a hypervariable region (sequencing of the flagellin
A short variable region) to the SNP-based genotyping
reduced to insignificance the incidence of unrelated isolates failing to be discriminated, thus demonstrating the
value of the D-optimized SNP set. In summary, for both
species, Not-N-derived SNPs are generally not optimal for
assigning isolates to larger CCs, but are highly effective for
identifying the smaller CCs.
CGH datasets
CGH allows the large-scale identification of genetic differences across a number of strains. Bayesian-based algorithms applied to the CGH data of C. jejuni, Y.
enterocolitica and C. difficile enabled the identification of
phylogenetic clades that can predict infection source or
pathogenicity traits. Champion et al. [5] identified two
distinct clades in C. jejuni predictive of infection source,
with one clade containing predominantly livestock isolates and the other non-livestock (environmental) isolates. Isolates identified from human infection were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/278

roughly evenly distributed between the two clades. In Y.
enterocolitica, three clades corresponding to non-pathogenic (biotype 1A), low-pathogenicity (biotypes 2–5) and
highly pathogenic (biotype 1B) were identified by the
comparative phylogenomics approach [4]. For C. difficile,
CGH phylogeny identified four clades comprising a
hypervirulent clade, a toxin A-B+ clade, and two clades
containing human and animal isolates [6].
The three CGH studies identified binary genes specific to
particular clades using MacClade, parsimony-based software that is used for reconstructing phylogeny and interpreting patterns of character evolution [30]. MacClade 4
was used to identify 33 coding sequences (CDS) in C.
jejuni that were characteristic of the livestock clade,
including the gene cluster Cj1321 to Cj1326 within the Olinked flagellin glycosylation locus. However, none of the
33 CDS identified by MacClade 4 analysis were 100% specific to the livestock clade [5]. In contrast, Not-N analysis
identified two binary genes from the C. jejuni CGH data
that separated, with 100% confidence, isolates from the
livestock clade from those in the nonlivestock clade
(Table 1).
Within the Y. enterocolitica CGH data, MacClade 4 analysis
identified several CDS that were 100% specific to each of
the three pathogenicity clades [4]. Some of these genes,
such as YE1820 (characteristic of the non-pathogenic
clade), were classed as divergent based on the array signal
but considered present for the purposes of the MacClade
analysis. CGH cannot reliably detect small differences in
hybridizations caused by moderate gene divergence [31].
For this reason, only genes that were clearly present or
absent were analyzed by Not-N to remove potential miscalled binary gene status. Three binary genes were identified that enabled 100% discrimination between the
differing pathogeneses of Y. enterocolitica. In C. difficile,
MacClade analysis did not identify binary gene sets specific for isolates within the four clades, and many of the
identified genes were divergent [6]. In comparison, Not-N
analysis identified four binary genes that separated the
four distinct clades described by Stabler et al. [6] with
100% confidence. These results demonstrate that the
application of Not-N to CGH data was both more efficient
and able to identify fewer binary targets than MacClade
analyses (Table 1).
Viral sequence datasets
A large number of complete genome sequences are currently available for both HCV (188 genomes) and HIV-1
(1507 genomes) [8,10], providing an ideal resource to
examine the performance of Not-N analysis on well-characterized loci within these viruses. Despite examining several loci, Not-N analysis was unable to identify SNPs
diagnostic for any of the HIV-1 clades. This is likely due to

the exceptionally high degree of recombination between
HIV-1 variants that has resulted in the emergence of circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) [32]. Given these
results, and the acceptance of sequencing as the appropriate HIV-1 genotyping approach, it was concluded that
Not-N derived SNPs are not suitable for HIV-1 genotyping. In contrast, Not-N analysis identified 15 HCV SNPs
that delineate, with 100% confidence, the 13 predominant subtypes of this virus (Table 2). Interestingly, Not-N
analysis failed to identify comparably informative SNP
sets for the six major genotype groups (1–6) of HCV, possibly as a consequence of the high level of divergence
between subtypes within each genotype group.
Current HCV genotyping methods such as the line probe
assay (INNO-LiPA) [33], the real-time PCR-based Abbott
HCV analyte-specific reagent (ASR) and COBAS
TaqMan48 HCV tests [34,35], restriction fragment length
polymorphism analysis [36] and primer extension methods [37] primarily target the 5' non-coding region (5'NCR). A drawback of targeting the 5'-NCR is that some
subtypes, such as 1a and 1b, 1b and 6a, or 2a and 2c,
remain indistinguishable in a small number of cases due
to the conserved nature of this region [38,39]. In contrast,
the 15 HCV SNPs identified by Not-N analysis were
derived from RNA-polymerase NS5B rather than the
5'NCR, and unlike 5'-NCR-derived SNPs, are 100% specific for each of the 13 subtypes of HCV. This finding is
significant as the correlation between HCV genotype and
clinical outcome is well-documented. Genotype-specific
differences between HCV variants aid in assessing the clinical management of infection, with genotypes 1 and 4
more resistant than genotypes 2 and 3 to interferon-αbased therapy. In addition, HCV variants appear specific
to particular geographic regions, such as the widespread
distribution of HCV subtype 1a throughout the USA and
Northern Europe [40].

To our knowledge, this is the first set of genotyping targets
that enables the specific and accurate discrimination of
the 13 major subtypes of HCV. Real-time PCR-based
methods, such as allele-specific real-time PCR [41] or
high-resolution melt analysis [42], are promising candidates for interrogating the 15 SNPs due to their ability to
accurately interrogate polymorphisms in diverse DNA
sequence, such as that found within the NS5B region of
HCV.

Conclusion
This study has shown that the Not-N algorithm provides
a practical tool for identifying diagnostic polymorphisms
that discriminate bacterial or viral populations of interest.
Not-N analysis was particularly valuable with bacterial
CGH and HCV genome sequence data, where the software
identified genetic markers with superior performance to
polymorphisms in current use. The ability of the algorithm to select SNPs diagnostic for MLST-defined CCs was
dependent on CC size, with large numbers of SNPs
required to delineate the larger CCs that have undergone
extensive recombination. The purpose of the Not-N algorithm is conceptually similar to the identification of
canonical phylogenetic SNPs, such as those previously
described for Bacillus anthracis [43], and indeed would be
valuable for identifying canonical SNPs in other clonal
populations. Not-N analysis is likely to become increasingly useful as comparative databases expand in size, and
as more is uncovered about the relationships between
pathogen genotype, infection epidemiology and clinical
outcomes. This approach to data analysis may also be
applied to the identification of discriminatory sets of
genetic polymorphisms that have direct biological significance, rather than being simply diagnostic markers. In
such instances, it may not be so critical for the "0% false
negative" criterion to be fulfilled. This allows an approach
in which the analysis is carried out twice, with one or

other of the two groups of variants defined as the "group
of interest" in each case. This increases the probability that
informative sets of polymorphisms will be identified.

Methods
Bacterial and viral databases
The sequence type (ST) and allele files for C. jejuni, S.
aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae were downloaded from
the MLST databases for these organisms [28]. For
Escherichia coli, data was obtained from two MLST
schemes using seven loci [44-46], eBURST v3 was used to
assign STs to clonal complexes (CCs) [47]. For S. aureus
and C. jejuni, CCs were defined as STs sharing 6/7 loci
with the ancestral clone, whereas with H. influenzae and E.
coli, this parameter was set to 5/7 loci and 4/7 loci, respectively.

Sequence data for HIV-1 and HCV were downloaded from
the respective databases [8,10]. The region spanning
nucleotides 8276 to 8615 of the HCV genome corresponding to a partial sequence of the RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase, NS5B, was chosen for SNP analysis as
this region is used to construct phylogenetic trees for HCV
[40]. In total 770 NS5B sequences were analyzed. The thirteen confirmed HCV genotypes were examined: 1a, 1b,
2a, 2b, 2c, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4d, 4f, 4t, 5a and 6a. For HIV-1, we
tested the ability of the Not-N algorithm to select SNPs
that would identify the genotype M group as this genotype
comprises over 99% of human HIV-1 infections [32].
CGH array data for C. jejuni, Y. enterocolitica and C. difficile
was downloaded from BμG@s [48] accessions E-BUGS-

22, E-BUGS-36 and E-BUGS-41). CGH data was filtered to
exclude genes considered divergent in one or more strains,
and 'flagged' genes (data missing in one or more strains,
due to a poor array signal). Based on these criteria, 696,
1080 and 785 genes from the available 111 C. jejuni, 93 Y.
enterocolitica and 74 C. difficile strains [4-6] were analyzed
using the Not-N module of "Minimum SNPs". Gene presence or absence was converted to nucleotide format to
enable "Minimum SNPs" analysis as previously described
[24]. Isolates were grouped for Not-N analysis according
to previous CGH phylogeny with the exception of Y. enterocolitica strain 237_02, which was shown to group with
the non-pathogenic clade following ClustalX phylogenetic analysis [49] and visualization using TreeView 1.6.6
[50] of the filtered dataset.
The Not-N algorithm and its implementation
The Not-N algorithm is designed to derive, from sequence
alignments, sets of SNPs or binary genes that discriminate
a user-defined subset of the isolates (the group of interest)
from all the other genotypes in the alignment (the outgroup). The fundamental principle of this algorithm is
that it does not treat the group of interest and the outgroup equally. A position in the alignment is only considered informative if one or more bases that are present at
that position in the out-group are not present in any of the
sequences in the group of interest. The resolving power of
a position is the proportion of out-group sequences that
contain the base(s) in common with the group of interest.
The rationale for the algorithm design is twofold. Firstly,
the derived SNP sets cannot give rise to false-negatives
since SNPs are specifically selected to identify all members

of a group of interest. This lack of false-negatives is important if the SNP sets are to form the bases of e.g. diagnostic
procedures for identifying virulent subgroups within a
species. Secondly, Not-N can accommodate polymorphisms within the group of interest; that is, the algorithm
is not reliant on identifying only invariant sites within the
group of interest. Therefore, Not-N efficiently uses the
available sequence data. The algorithm is demonstrated in
Table 3. STs 1, 2, and 3 are the group of interest whilst the
remaining STs are the out-group. A consensus sequence is
assembled by scoring each nucleotide in the alignment as
'Not-A/C/G/T'. The out-group sequences are subsequently

scored as a match (+) or mismatch (-) relative to the consensus sequence for the group of interest.
The Not-N function has been incorporated into the "Minimum SNPs" version 2.043 software [19,23]. Previous versions of this software identified SNP sets on the basis of
two user-selectable performance criteria:maximization of
D, or maximization of the power to discriminate one userselected sequence from all known sequences. The Not-N
algorithm represents a third user-selectable performance
criterion for SNP set assembly. The SNP sets are assembled
one SNP at a time, with the SNP giving the highest inform-

ative power identified first, followed by the SNP that gives
the highest informative power in combination with the
previous SNP, and so forth. Where different SNPs have
identical informative power, multiple SNP combinations
are assembled, until either a pre-set level of discrimination, a pre-set number of SNPs, or 100% discrimination is
reached. The software incorporates 'include' and 'exclude'
functions that allow the operator to force the inclusion of
one or more SNPs in the output SNP set, or to remove one
or more SNPs from the analysis. This provides considerable flexibility in SNP set assembly, which can be of benefit
when optimizing actual assays, and provides a means of
protecting against "local minima" (SNP sets with nonoptimal resolving power due to pathway constraints
imposed by the first identified SNP). In the example
shown in Table 3, SNP 1 is classed as non-informative as
the group of interest is not deficient in any bases in comparison to the out-group at that position, whilst SNPs 2 to
7, either alone or in combination, discriminate the group
of interest from the out-group with different levels of confidence. Use of the exclude function to remove SNPs 3 and
4 yields a new SNP set that reaches 100% discrimination
(Table 3C) as efficiently as the SNP sets in Table 3B.
