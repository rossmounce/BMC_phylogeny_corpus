Rationale

For some time after their discovery in 1983 [9], TA systems
were only found on plasmids. They were defined as plasmid
inheritance guarantor systems, and called 'plasmid addiction
systems'. Several years later, two homologous TA operons
were discovered on the Escherichia coli chromosome [10,11].
Interest in these chromosomal TA systems led to the discovery of further systems in various bacteria [12-14], and of their
involvement in programmed cell death (PCD) [15]. It was suggested that under severe starvation conditions, the TA-mediated PCD of moribund subpopulations provides the

information

The toxin/antitoxin (TA) modules are a group of sORFs for
which knowledge has been improving over the past two decades. Most TA modules are constituted of two adjacent co-oriented but antagonist genes: one encodes a stable toxin
harmful to an essential cell process, and the second a labile

antitoxin that blocks the toxin's activity by DNA- or proteinbinding [6]. TA pairs have been classified into two types. The
first are those where the antitoxin is an antisense-RNA. They
have been linked to plasmid stabilization by means of a postsegregational killing (PSK) effect, [7] (for a review, see [8]).
The second type, on which we focus in this study, includes loci
where the antitoxin is a fully translated protein. For consistency with previous studies, we shall refer to them throughout
this paper as TA systems.

interactions

More than 500 prokaryotic genomes have now been completely sequenced and annotated, and the number of
sequencing projects underway (approximately 1,300) indicates that the amount of such data is going to rise very rapidly
[1,2]. Large-scale comparative genomics based on these data
constituted a giant leap forward in the process of gene identification. Nevertheless, substantial numbers of annotated
open reading frames (ORFs) throughout the sequenced
genomes remain hypothetical, most of which are 200 amino
acids in length or shorter [3]. Luckily, interest in these small
ORFs (sORFs) is growing [4], and recent work in Sacharromyces cerevisiae shows that they may be involved in key cellular functions [5].

Toxin/antitoxin (TA) systems, viewed as essential regulators of growth arrest and programmed cell
death, are widespread among prokaryotes, but remain sparsely annotated. We present RASTABacteria, an automated method allowing quick and reliable identification of TA loci in sequenced
prokaryotic genomes, whether they are annotated open reading frames or not. The tool
successfully confirmed all reported TA systems, and spotted new putative loci upon screening of
sequenced genomes. RASTA-Bacteria is publicly available at http://genoweb.univ-rennes1.fr/duals/

remaining healthy cells with nutrients, thus benefiting the
species. Proof was later established that some TA systems
actually provoke a static state in certain adverse conditions, in
which cells remain viable but do not proliferate, and that this
state is fully reversible on cognate antitoxin induction [16].
However, it was later shown that this reversible effect is only
possible within a limited time frame. Subsequently, there is a
'point of no return' in the killing effect of the toxin [17,18].
TA systems, widespread among both bacteria and archaea
[19], are currently classified into eight families, depending on
their structural features or modes of action [20]. Little is
known about the only three-component family, whose founding member is the omega-epsilon-zeta (ω-ε-ζ) system from
plasmid pSM19035, except that the additional gene (ω) acts
as a repressor regulating the transcription of the operon [21].
ω-ε-ζ systems are found only in Gram-positive bacteria. The
remaining seven, two-component families, include: the
ParDE system, found in Gram-negative and Gram-positive
bacteria and in archaea, targets DNA gyrase [22]; HigBA,
unique in that its toxin is located upstream from its antitoxin
[23], is found in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria,
and its action involves mRNA cleavage [24]; the phd/doc
locus, found in all types of prokaryotes, is believed to inhibit
translation [25]; and the vapBC locus, found both on plasmids and chromosomes, seems to be the TA system with the
highest copy-number in the prokaryotes that bear them, but
no cellular target has yet been reported, although VapC toxins
contain a PIN domain (homologue of the pilT amino-terminal
domain: ribonuclease involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay and RNA interference in eukaryotes), suggesting that
the system may contribute to quality control of gene expression [26]. The other three families are the best characterized:
the ccdAB locus, found only in some Gram-negative bacteria,
stabilizes plasmids upon replication by targeting DNA gyrase
[27]; members of the RelBE family, present in Gram-negatives, Gram-positives and archaea, inhibit cell growth by
impairing translation due to mRNA cleavage through the Asite of the ribosome [28,29]; and finally, the toxins of the
MazEF/PemIK family, sometimes referred to as 'RNA interferases' [30], are ribonucleases that cleave cellular mRNA,
thus depriving the ribosomes of substrates to translate [31] they have been found in Gram-negative and Gram-positive
bacteria.
The role of TA systems in programmed cell death opens
promising possibilities for the design of a new class of antibiotics [32]. Moreover, chromosome-borne TA systems are
activated by various extreme conditions, including the presence of antibiotics [33] or infecting phages [34], thymine starvation or other DNA damage [35], high temperatures, and
oxidative stress [36]. Their involvement in the response to
amino acid starvation [37] also raises large interest: indeed,
TA modules are believed to provide a backup system to the
stringent response by controlling superfluous macromolecular biosynthesis during stasis independently of ppGpp [38],

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/8/R155

the stringent response alarmone eliciting the protective reactions cascade. A reduced rate of translation is associated with
fewer translational errors, so TA loci may contribute to quality control of gene expression, helping the cells cope with
nutritional stress [20]. Therefore, it remains a priority to
exhaustively identify TA loci in prokaryotic organisms in
order to improve our understanding of these systems and
more broadly of the cellular mechanisms behind bacterial
adaptation.
In 2005, Pandey and co-workers [39] performed an exhaustive search in 126 completely sequenced genomes (archaea
and eubacteria), using standard sequence alignment tools
(BLASTP and TBLASTN). Their work highlighted a surprising diversity in the distribution of TA loci: some organisms
have many (Nitrosomonas europaea has 45 potential TA systems), whereas more than half of the other species have
between 1 and 5, and 31 have none. Nevertheless, the use of
basic nucleic or amino acid sequence similarity limits these
findings to toxins and antitoxins for which a clear homolog
exists; there is, therefore, a possible bias in their results. In
view of the aforementioned lack of annotation of the small
ORFs, and to improve localization techniques for TA systems,
we developed a simple method for identifying all potential TA
systems in a given bacterial genome: Rapid Automated Scan
for Toxins and Antitoxins in Bacteria (RASTA-Bacteria). This
method is based on the genomic features associated with toxins and antitoxins and the existence of conserved functional
domains. The results, sorted by a confidence score, discard no
candidate, thus providing the user an extensive overview of
the data.

Process overview

The module-based pipeline of RASTA-Bacteria is described in
Figure 1. The first step is to provide a genomic sequence. Even
though it can be useful to test relatively short 'raw' nucleic
sequences for the presence of a TA system, RASTA-Bacteria
was designed to function with whole-replicon genomic
sequences, regardless of their size (small plasmids or large
chromosomes). The tool can thus take both simple (FASTAformatted) nucleic sequences or fully annotated (GenBank)
files as input data. They can either be selected from an extensive list of sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes, or be
provided by the user in the case of an unpublished genome.
The second step enables the user to tune optional parameters
for the search: depending on the origin of the input sequence,
it is possible to choose the length-scoring model, from 'general', 'archaea', 'Gram+', and 'Gram-', on which the scoring
function must rely. The sensitivity of the tool can also be
improved by modifying the bit-score threshold for the
RPSBLAST alignments. However, we defined the default
value from our experiments and believe it is the most appropriate. Similarly, a minimal ORF size for the ORF finder can
be defined, as well as an annotated gene overlap percentage

limit the amount of data (hence time of computation), and
should be refined only in particular cases, such as for known
high-overlapping genomes for example. The third step is the
run phase, performed as follows: first, screening of the
nucleic sequence for open-reading frames; second, screening
of newly determined ORFs for the presence of TA domains;
third, size-based scoring of the ORFs; and fourth, scoring
based on the pairing possibility of an ORF with another. In
the last step, the results are combined to calculate a global
confidence score for each ORF. These are then ranked accordingly and displayed to the user in a tabular format, which

Description of the algorithm
Genomic features used for discriminating TA systems
It should be noted here that hipBA loci (found to have a role
in the production of 'persister cells' in E. coli [42]), as well as
restriction-modification (type II) systems, can also be considered as TA systems. Nevertheless, the latter have been extensively identified and characterized elsewhere [43,44], and
have been excluded from our work. Because of its specific
organization, the three-component TA family (ω-ε-ζ) was also
excluded from the present study.
TA systems by definition consist of, at least, two genes: the
'dormant guard' role is fulfilled by the presence of a toxic and
a protective protein together, although some orphan genes
(for which conservation of functionality as such remains
unclear) have been reported [39,45]. Whether or not the TA
pairs are encoded by genes forming an operon, the spacer seldom extends beyond 30 nucleotides, and a small overlap (1 to
20 nucleotides in general) is the most common structure. The
order of the two cooperating genes is also well conserved,
with the antitoxin being upstream (Figure 3), although there
is an exception: in higBA loci the toxin is upstream of the antitoxin [23].

and toxins 31 to 204 amino acids long, antitoxins generally
being shorter than their partner toxins (Figure 4). Here too
there seems to be an exception: the toxin of the HipBA system
is 440 amino acids in length (not shown).
These two features have been used with success as preliminary filters to a biological search for unidentified TA pairs in
E. coli [46], but this approach is too permissive to be accurate
as an automatic predictor. By adding a third criterion, namely
the presence of a conserved functional domain, the selectivity

information

To bypass the mis-annotation of TA genes, which, like many
small ORFs, are easily omitted during the annotation process,
the tool begins with a naïve ORF prediction. This first step is
essential to ensure that the analysis leaves no possible ORF
aside. RASTA-Bacteria thus starts by predicting the entire set
of valid ORFs in the sequence, defined as the series of triplets
occurring between one of the four accepted prokaryotic start
codons (NTG), and one of the three stop codons (TGA, TAG,
TAA), with no further assumption about the profile of the
ORF. In the case of alternative start codons, redundancy is

avoided by considering only the longest possible sequence.
Although no possible ORFs should be overlooked, existing
genomic information (in the case of an annotated genome,
the preferred input) should not be ignored. Indeed, even if
sometimes flawed, the original annotation can provide
RASTA-Bacteria with valuable hints. Therefore, the tool
recovers all the annotated features of the sequence, and compares the 'naïve' ORFs to the existing set of genes. If a naïve
ORF overlaps an annotated gene (whose 'product' and 'confidence' fields do not display the terms 'unknown', 'putative', or
'hypothetical') by more than a threshold percentage (see
parameters), then it is discarded as a spurious ORF. If the
considered ORF corresponds to an annotated ORF, its score
is rewarded to reflect the annotators' work, that is, the probability that this ORF actually encodes a protein. For reasons of

interactions

of the method over the input space can be improved.
Furthermore, as the knowledge base of TA systems grows,
sequence homology can provide further information.

consistency, this process also renames existing ORFs with
their common designation.

Conserved domain verification: a specific TAdedicated database
Once the whole list of candidate ORFs is established, the
ORFs undergo a conserved domain search. To achieve this,
we use the Reverse PSI-BLAST program (RPSBLAST, part of
the standalone blast archive, release 2.2.14 [47]), which
searches a query sequence against a database of pre-computed lookup tables called PSSMs (position specific scoring

matrices), originating from the Pfam, Smart, COG, KOG and
cd alignment collections (the complete archive of conserved
domain PSSMs can be found at [48]). These profiles then
need to be formatted as a usable database by the formatrpsdb
tool [47]. For our purposes, we thus built a dedicated TA conserved domains database (TAcddb), compiled from the existing profiles of domains known to belong to toxin and
antitoxin genes (Table 1), against which all the sequences in
amino acids are searched. Consequently, TA systems with
unknown functionally conserved domains are unfortunately
liable to be penalized. However, the combining of different

information

S. meliloti is a Gram-negative alpha-proteobacterium studied
in our laboratory that is found both free-living in soil and in a
symbiotic interaction with alfalfa where it forms root nodules.
Its genome is made up of a 3.65 Mb circular chromosome and
two essential megaplasmids, pSymA (1.35 Mb) and pSymB
(1.68 Mb), all of them being GC rich (62.2% global) [50].
These features (large and tripartite genome with recently
acquired plasmid, free and symbiotic life ability) make S.
meliloti an interesting model for the validation of RASTAbacteria. In the 2005 search by Pandey et al. [39], 12 TA systems (2 relBE-like, 3 higBA-like, and 7 vapBC-like) were
identified, but only the chromosome was considered. We analyzed all three replicons with RASTA-Bacteria, as they are all
constituents of the complete genome. Of the 12 systems identified by Pandey et al., 11 were positively discriminated by
RASTA, including the ntrPR operon, which was recently
shown to function as a TA system [51], demonstrating the
good accuracy of our software. The 12th one (higBA-2,
GI15965582-15965583) was only poorly rewarded by the
method described here; indeed, none of the TA domain profiles corresponding to its described classification (nor others)
were matched by the members of this TA pair, which furthermore do not fit the size and distance criteria. Further
sequence analysis did reveal similarity with a putative addiction module killer protein for the amino-terminal half of gene
15965582, but a second conserved domain in its carboxy-terminal half, as well as the conserved domains ('ABC transporter') found in its reported partner, are rather

interactions

This smoothes the curb of probabilities to some extent, as it
avoids accidental high or low counts of a given length to be
given undue weight with respect to surrounding lengths. Several datasets were created so that the scoring function reflects
the different types of organisms: general, archaea, Gram-negative and Gram-positive. The user can thus choose which
model to use depending on the species being considered. Similarly, although defining size functions for each of the seven
TA families is at first sight appealing, it should be emphasized
that automatic classification of TA loci is risky. This is due to
diverging homologies: some toxin motifs pair with antitoxin
motifs, or more simply toxins/antitoxins of a given family
sometimes demonstrate similarity with those of another family [39]. Therefore, relying on such specific characteristics for
the size criterion evaluation might lead to mis-scoring.

All tests reported in this section were carried out with annotated .gbk files downloaded on 1 September 2006 from the
RefSeq repository [49], on a Mac PowerPC G5 with Mac OS X
v.10.3.9. For multi-replicon organisms, all episomes were
included in the analysis. Running times were between 40 s
(for a 600 Mb genome) and 33 minutes (for a 9 Gb genome).

where N = 1,378. We then defined our scoring function by
averaging the probability over k neighboring lengths before
and after the considered length such that:

deposited research

The candidates proceed to a size-scoring module. Based on
the lengths of 1,378 TA sequences (Figure 4) described following the extensive search by Pandey's team [39], we calculated
the probability for length l of a candidate to be that of a toxin
or an antitoxin as follows:

Finally, the method verifies that the ORFs are paired on the
strand considered. To do so, the module searches for close
neighbors upstream and downstream of the ORF, in agreement with the distance parameter described above: a neighbor is considered close if it lies less than 30 base-pairs away
from the extremities of the ORF, and if it overlaps the ORF by
less than 20 base-pairs. In practice, both values can be somewhat enlarged, so as to avoid potential loss of candidates in
the case of an extended span of the ORF due to alternative
start codons. Thus, if an ORF fits these criteria, its score is
rewarded. Furthermore, if the neighbor exhibits a TA length
and/or a TA domain, the score is given the corresponding
bonus. Obviously, this diminishes the chances of fortuitous or
clearly non-TA characterized operons finding themselves
among the top candidates.

The length criterion

reviews

For each candidate, the hits are analyzed to select the most
likely in terms of both homology and sequence alignment
length. If the candidate ORF exhibits a clear homology,
namely a high score and over 80% of a full product domain
aligned, but is longer than the corresponding profile, it is
scanned for alternative start codons to identify any other 5'
end that gives a better profile fit. If this is the case, the ORF is
resized to its new coordinates. A short description of the
possible domain is stored for subsequent display as a hint to
the user for further classification, with an internal hyperlink
to the alignment: again, no information is discarded and all
the results can be visually assessed. Here, each reference
domain used is levelheaded with a coefficient representing its
implication in the TA kingdom: those defined by a confirmed
TA family have a higher coefficient than domains found in
TAs but not exclusive to them (for example, PIN versus VapB
domain). This coefficient is computed together with the alignment data to yield the 'domain score'.

contradictory with the fact that this pair might comprise a
valid TA system. There is thus no concrete evidence that enables us to confirm this hypothesis.
We found 14 additional putative TA loci on the chromosome
(bringing the population to 25 for this replicon), 17 loci on
pSymA and 11 on pSymB (Figure 5a). Hence, our approach
predicts a total of 53 TA loci in the complete genome of S.
meliloti, including 95 genes of which 18 are newly identified.
Their distribution across the various replicons seems
random, although there is an apparent alternation of rich and
poor areas, in particular in the megaplasmids (Figure 6).
Similarly, they are remarkably evenly distributed between
lagging and leading strands (Figure 5c). Relative to the sizes
of the replicons, megaplasmid A, suspected to have been
acquired more recently in the genome, contains twice as
many TA loci as the other replicons (Figure 5b). Interestingly,
the genetic organizations are diverse, although pairs remain
the most frequent (71.5 %): 12 genes in 4 triplets, 68 genes in
34 pairs and 15 solitary genes (12 encode antitoxins and 3

encode toxins, one of them being the chromosomal relE; Figure 4d).
The classification of candidates into families according to
sequence homology alone is a tedious task. Nevertheless, it
seems the two major families are vapBC, consistent with the
findings of Pandey et al. [39], and parDE. No ccdAB locus was
found, but the results indicate there may be parDE and phd/
doc members (distributed on all three replicons) among the
candidates, as well as one mazEF pair, situated on plasmid B.

RASTA-bacteria results compared to those from
previous studies
Our tool proved to be efficient and fast for the bacterium S.
meliloti, which was used for its design. The effectiveness of
RASTA-Bacteria for other sequences was first assessed using
14 prokaryotes previously studied by Pandey et al. [39] (Table
2): three gamma-proteobacteria (E. coli as an AT-rich generic
model, Coxiella burnetii as an obligate host-associated organism and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a free living, GC-rich
bacterium); two alpha-proteobacteria (Bradyrhizobium

RASTA-bacteria identified all TA loci previously predicted by
Pandey et al. except for one locus in S. meliloti (see above)
and one higBA system in B. japonicum, which was not
retained because the confidence score was too low (although
there are conserved domains, they are ambiguous and were

not included in TAcddb). The absence of detectable TA genes
from the three obligate host-associated organisms tested (R.
prowazekii, B. aphidicola, M. leprae) was confirmed, as was
the presence of a single TA locus in Bacillus sp. Our tool was
more sensitive than the previously used method: in all other
tested genomes, RASTA-Bacteria identified a large number of
new candidate loci. This was largely due to detection of potential members of the higBA, relBE, hipBA families and especially the vapBC family. For example, even in the case of the
well-documented model E. coli, RASTA-Bacteria predicts at
least four new TA pairs with high confidence (yfeD/yfeC,
yafN/yafO, ygjN/ygjM and sohA/yahV). In addition, the
ygiT/b3022, ydcQ/yncN and ydaS/ydaT loci have at least
one member with a conserved domain commonly found in
antitoxins, and ranked higher than published TA genes.
Finally, YbaQ demonstrates near perfect identity with the
profile corresponding to VapB antitoxins, but has no physically close partner, so it most likely is a solitary antitoxin, the
first such to be reported in E. coli.

Numbers stand for TA systems (singleton or doublet) as predicted by: RASTA-Bacteria (numbers in parentheses are as predicted by Pandey et al.
[39]). *Plasmids were not included in the analysis by Pandey et al. [39]. Unclass., unclassified.

Ten previously undescribed TA systems were identified in the
four replicons of A. tumefaciens (Table 2), although only the
two chromosomes were previously studied. RASTA-Bacteria
confirmed the 14 systems previously reported and identified
5 additional (orphan) loci on the circular chromosome, 1 full
pair and 1 orphan gene on the linear chromosome, and 2 TA
systems on plasmid AT. It revealed plasmid Ti carries no plasmid addiction systems, although it does have a gene resembling hipA (Atu6158, GI|17939291). However, this candidate
is substantially shorter than its reference, such that it is
unlikely to be functional, and it is almost 60 kb away from any
possible hipB candidate.
We also assessed the sensitivity of our tool by examining
genomes containing many TA loci, including that of N. europaea, reported to have no less than 45 TA loci, representing
88 genes. The RASTA-Bacteria scan of the genome of N.
europaea yielded high confidence scores for 76 of these previously identified genes (86%), a confidence score between
50% and 70% for 11 (12.5%) and an unranked score for 1. It
identified 11 additional TA loci on the N. europaea chromosome, if the hipBA locus is taken into account. Three are
clearly vapBC pairs, although one is made of two relatively
short and possibly disrupted genes, raising doubt about
whether this pair is functional. The NE2103/NE2104 pair

gave an intermediate confidence score, but has characteristics
consistent with it being a TA system. NE1375/NE1376 may
well define a new MazEF-like system. Finally, three orphan
vapB and two orphan higA genes were found: it would be
interesting to determine whether they are silent relics of
ancient systems or are still active and responsible for a function. Remarkably, all these newly identified loci map in the
same regions as the previously discovered systems, reinforcing the observation that TA loci in N. europaea cluster in particular regions of the genome.
We also applied our tool to organisms where no TA loci had
been found previously, including L. lactis, in which we predict
ten possible TA loci, eight of which consist of an orphan gene
containing a region encoding the same HTH_DNA-binding
(for helix-turn-helix) profile.
Finally, the archaeum with the most TA loci was S. tokodaii,
with 32 TA loci [39]. RASTA-Bacteria confirmed 52 of the 61
genes at these 32 TA loci (3 singletons): the STS188/ST1628
and ST2136/37 pairs gave low scores because of an extreme
overlap or because of an alternative start codon causing a bias
in the size scoring process. The results for five other genes
cannot be interpreted with certainty, but observations in
other organisms where orphan TA genes do not seem uncom-

Application to newly selected genomes

The analysis of both first and second rounds combined
allowed us to confirm that there is no correlation between
number of TA loci and total genome size, although the size of
1 Mb seems to represent some sort of threshold (Additional

No evident association can be established between the
number of TA loci and membership of a phylum (Additional
data file 2) or lifestyle (Additional data file 3). The only 'freeliving' organisms that do not have TA loci are Thermofilum
pendens and Prochlorococcus marinus, although a possible
'pseudogenic' locus was detected in P. marinus strain
MIT9303. The 13 other TA-free genomes are small (<1 Mb)
and all correspond to obligate host-associated bacteria. In
this study, the genomes of four obligate intracellular bacteria
were newly discovered to carry TA systems (Wolbachia, Bartonella, Lawsonia and Azoarcus), in apparent contradiction
of the hypothesis according to which endosymbiotic organ-

mon suggests that some loci predicted to be pairs might in
fact belong to the single-gene loci category. Nevertheless, four
additional TA loci were identified, two of them being standard
pairs of the VapBC family. The TA loci are unevenly distributed through the chromosome: two regions of approximately
240 and 440 kb seem to be devoid of TA loci, and the loci
appear to be clustered in particular regions (data not shown).

isms tend to be free from TA systems. However, this hypothesis is consistent with the genome reduction theory, and quite
a few studies show that chromosomal TA genes, at least, can
be deleted (knockout mutants in E. coli) without any detectable impairment of the bacteria [15,16,52]. This assumption
that TA systems have been lost during the process of genome
reduction is also supported by the failure of RASTA-Bacteria
to find any TA systems in the genomes of organelles, including the mitochondria (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Ostreococcus tauri) and chloroplast (Ostreococcus tauri, Lotus
japonicum, Medicago truncatula) (data not shown).
An attempt to classify TA loci into families led to the observation that the largest family is vapBC (37% percent of the 532
loci found in this study), despite members of this family being
absent from firmicutes and cyanobacteria. The other families
each have similar numbers of representatives (higBA, 10% of
the TA systems identified; mazEF, 12%; relBE, 12%; hipBA,
7%; parDE, 7%; and unclassified, 11%) except phd/doc and
ccdAB, which are rarer (3% and 0.009%, respectively). Only
the parDE family was confirmed to be confined to the bacterial domain: it was not found in archaea. Some organisms are
'monofamily', for example Wolbachia sp., which has seven
relBE systems, whereas Polaromonas naphthalenivorans or
N. europeae, two betaproteobacteria, contain members of all
nine families (Tables 2 and 3).
The raw result tables along with selected candidates corresponding to the pre-computed genomes described in the article can be accessed from the designated section of the website

Discussion

Exhaustive high-quality annotation is an essential part of
exploiting the increasing number of genome sequences
available, particularly of prokaryotes. One common problem
of bacterial genome annotation is the frequent omission of
sORFs, especially when they present limited or no sequence
homology. The more problematic consequences of this omission include the underestimation of the number of ORFs and
the loss of information concerning the presence of essential
functions. This is particularly the case for TA genes, which
encode small proteins involved in a large variety of essential
bacterial functions, especially stress physiology and programmed cell death. Indeed, these systems open new
horizons for antibiotic treatments, as they constitute promising targets.
Therefore, we have developed RASTA-Bacteria, a new and
unique web-based annotation tool that searches, evaluates
and stores TA modules in any prokaryotic sequenced genome.
The simple interface allows biologists to identify TA genes
quickly and reliably, whether they be organized in pairs or
isolated. Although TA classification is still problematic, functional assignment is suggested through domain identifica-

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/8/R155

tion. The power of RASTA-Bacteria in annotating putative TA
modules stems from it combining detection of function, using
a new knowledge-based database (TAcddb), and genomic
context of the genes (small and paired).
No absolute rule can be inferred for exact prediction of the
number and nature of TA loci in the genome of a bacterium
based only on its characteristics, such as its phylum or ecosystem. The search for TA genes must thus be carried out de novo
for each genome (or even each strain and each replicon),
making RASTA-Bacteria a potentially valuable tool. The
results described in the present study illustrate how satisfactorily the tool performs in terms of TA gene-finding accuracy
(compared to earlier annotations by Pandey et al. [39]). In
addition, the efficiency of RASTA-Bacteria is independent of
genome architecture (it works with linear and circular chromosomes from 9 to less than 1 Mb, megaplasmids, plasmids),
G+C content, bacterial classification (Gram+ and GramEubacteria, Archaea), and lifestyle (free living, symbiont,
endosymbiont). Furthermore, RASTA-Bacteria proved to be
functional for eukaryotic sequences. It is thus conceivable
that our tool will bring new insight to the TA world.
Our study also shows that TA systems are more various and
numerous than initially reported by Pandey et al. [39], with a
maximum of 65 loci in Mycobacterium bovis (Table 3). We
also found a significant number of genes, encoding potential
toxins or antitoxins, with no partner mapping in their vicinity. It is difficult to evaluate whether or not this phenomenon
is the result of classical TA system breakage with loss of functionality of the subsequent orphan genes, or if these independent elements have evolved towards new functionalities,
or even if distant interconnection is possible in the TA world.
These solitary genes are not eliminated from the screening
process and will be, like genes in pairs, subject to biological
validations, as some ORFs that have been scored may in fact
well be pseudogenes. An interesting future development of
RASTA-Bacteria would be to add a 'pseudogene' field to the
table.
Although the design of the RASTA-bacteria tool can sometimes lead to bias when assessing the pairing and/or length
properties, it is also interesting that we found many longer
proteins (between 350 and 500 amino acids) displaying
similarity with TA domains throughout our study (data not
shown). These findings are confusing, as they could either be
the consequence of the ability of TA genes to invade other
genes, and thus another argument in favor of their genetic
mobility, or of a possible fusion process among toxin and
antitoxin genes.
One of the most important improvements of RASTA-bacteria
would be the refinement of the automatic functional classification of TA systems. Indeed, TA proteins are currently classified into rather vague classes or subclasses in the result
tables, with generic domains such as the PIN domain: more

comment

precise classification of the candidates presently requires
manual analysis. RASTA-Bacteria also identified numerous
candidates displaying the HTH-DNA binding domains. When
adjacent to an unambiguous toxin domain, these signatures
could be clearly interpreted, but in some cases the identified
candidates seem to constitute an orphan gene. It will thus be
interesting to determine whether these loci are indeed true
TA loci, or whether they constitute a new uncharacterized
family of 'classical' regulators. In any case we hope that
RASTA-bacteria will help biologists with bacterial TA functional characterization, which will in turn allow us to improve
our algorithm by expanding our knowledge and database.
