Abstract
Background: Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (Map) causes an infectious chronic
enteritis (paratuberculosis or Johne's disease) principally of ruminants. The epidemiology of Map is
poorly understood, particularly with respect to the role of wildlife reservoirs and the controversial
issue of zoonotic potential (Crohn's disease). Genotypic discrimination of Map isolates is pivotal to
descriptive epidemiology and resolving these issues. This study was undertaken to determine the
genetic diversity of Map, enhance our understanding of the host range and distribution and assess
the potential for interspecies transmission.
Results: 164 Map isolates from seven European countries representing 19 different host species
were genotyped by standardized IS900 - restriction fragment length polymorphism (IS900-RFLP),
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and
mycobacterial interspersed repeat unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) analyses. Six
PstI and 17 BstEII IS900-RFLP, 31 multiplex [SnaBI-SpeI] PFGE profiles and 23 MIRU-VNTR profiles
were detected. AFLP gave insufficient discrimination of isolates for meaningful genetic analysis.

Point estimates for Simpson's index of diversity calculated for the individual typing techniques were
in the range of 0.636 to 0.664 but a combination of all three methods increased the discriminating
power to 0.879, sufficient for investigating transmission dynamics. Two predominant strain types
were detected across Europe with all three typing techniques. Evidence for interspecies
transmission between wildlife and domestic ruminants on the same property was demonstrated in
four cases, between wildlife species on the same property in two cases and between different
species of domestic livestock on one property.
Conclusion: The results of this study showed that it is necessary to use multiple genotyping
techniques targeting different sources of genetic variation to obtain the level of discrimination
necessary to investigate transmission dynamics and trace the source of Map infections.
Furthermore, the combination of genotyping techniques may depend on the geographical location
of the population to be tested. Identical genotypes were obtained from Map isolated from different
host species co-habiting on the same property strongly suggesting that interspecies transmission
occurs. Interspecies transmission of Map between wildlife species and domestic livestock on the
same property provides further evidence to support a role for wildlife reservoirs of infection.

Background
Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (Map)
causes paratuberculosis or Johne's disease, a fatal chronic
granulomatous enteritis. The disease occurs worldwide
and is responsible for significant economic losses to livestock and associated industries [1,2]. It is endemic in
Europe with only Sweden maintaining paratuberculosisfree status. The epidemiology is poorly understood and
there are important questions still to resolve, particularly
with respect to interspecies transmission. Map infects
principally ruminants but over the past decade it has
become apparent that the organism has a much broader
host range including monogastric species [3-5]. The infection of humans with Map and possible association with
Crohn's disease remains a controversial issue and requires
more study [6,7]. The strain types involved and the extent
to which interspecies transmission occurs have still to be
elucidated. Evidence also is accumulating regarding the
existence of potential wildlife reservoirs, for example,
infected rabbits appear to be a particular problem in some
areas of Scotland [3] but the role of such wildlife reservoirs in the epidemiology of the disease has still to be clarified.
Our knowledge and understanding of the epidemiology
of Map has been hindered for many years by our inability
to discriminate Map from the environmental species of
Mycobacterium avium (M. avium) and to differentiate
between Map isolates from different host species and different geographic locations. Recent advances in molecular
biology have led to the refinement and development of
molecular typing methods with sufficient discriminatory
power to differentiate between M. avium subspecies and
different Map isolates [8]. Genome analyses have revealed
two major strain groups designated 'Type I', or 'sheep or S
type' and 'Type II' or 'cattle or C type'. A sub-type of Type
I strains designated 'Type III' or 'intermediate or I type' is

found in sheep and goats. All three of these strain types
can be differentiated by restriction fragment length polymorphism coupled with hybridization to IS900 (IS900RFLP) [9,10] or pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
analyses [11,12] and by a PCR assay based on single
nucleotide polymorphisms in the gyrA and gyrB genes
[13]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the IS1311 element also distinguish three types designated 'S' (sheep),
'C' (cattle) and 'B' (bison) [14,15]. In this case the assay
cannot distinguish between Types I and III and the 'B' type
is a sub-type of Type II strains. In silico genome comparisons and techniques such as representational difference
analysis and microarray analysis have identified sequence
polymorphisms unique to either Type I or II strains and
these have been used to develop PCRs for discriminating
these strain groups [16-21]. The purpose of this study was
to investigate the molecular diversity of Map isolates from
a variety of hosts across Europe to enhance our understanding of the host range and distribution of the organisms and assess the potential for interspecies
transmission. Previous studies have revealed limited
genetic diversity; therefore, to maximise strain differentiation we evaluated several different molecular typing techniques in isolation and in combination; IS900-RFLP,
PFGE and PCR-based techniques including amplified
fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and mycobacterial interspersed repeat unit-variable number tandem
repeat (MIRU-VNTR).

Results
AFLP typing was performed at the Central Institute of
Wageningen University, Lelystad, The Netherlands and
MIRU-VNTR at INRA, Nouzilly, France. For PFGE and
IS900-RFLP typing, the field isolates were split between
two labs. PFGE typing was undertaken at the Moredun
Research Institute, Scotland, UK and VISAVET, Madrid,
Spain. IS900-RFLP typing was carried out at the Veterinary

Research Institute in Brno, Czech Republic and VISAVET.
Published standardized typing procedures were used as
described in Materials and Methods. The only difference
in procedures between laboratories was that at VISAVET
the IS900-RFLP analysis was performed using the agarose
plugs prepared for PFGE to avoid having to perform two
separate DNA preparations for the different typing techniques. The correct profiles were reported by all laboratories for the duplicate isolates included to check
reproducibility. All typing techniques correctly reported
that the Mycobacterium phlei (M. phlei), Mycobacterium bovis
BCG (M. bovis BCG) and IS901 positive M. avium were not
Map. One field isolate, EU112 was found to be IS901 positive M. avium (it is not known if the isolate is M. avium
subsp. avium or M. avium subsp. silvaticum) and not Map
as was originally suspected. Another isolate, EU169 was
found to be a mixed culture. Isolates one to 50 were typed
at Institut für Mikrobiologie Stiftung Tierärztliche Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany using the Type I/
Type II PCR as described by Dohmann et al. [17]. EU25
and EU30 were identified as Type I and all other field isolates as Type II. These results correlated with the strain
type as determined by PFGE. This PCR [17] cannot discriminate between Type I and Type III and as strain types
could be discerned from the PFGE profiles, it was not considered necessary to determine the strain type of the
remaining isolates by PCR. It was not possible to type all
of the isolates with all typing methods as some laboratories had difficulties in subculturing some isolates to prepare sufficient cells for analyses. A total of 123 Map
isolates were typed by IS900-RFLP, PFGE and MIRUVNTR.
IS900-RFLP typing
IS900-RFLP typing data were obtained for 147 Map isolates (Table 1 and see supplementary dataset in Additional file 1). It was not possible to obtain PstI profiles for
55 isolates or clear BstEII profiles for five isolates. There
was a problem using agarose plug DNA for IS900-RFLP
typing with PstI as the enzyme would not cleave in the
presence of agarose. Extraction of the DNA from the agarose and repeat PstI digestion was not attempted. As
expected, profiles were not obtained for the negative control strains M. bovis BCG, M. phlei and IS901 positive M.
avium. A total of six PstI profiles were found among 93 isolates: B (n = 88); G (n = 1); I (n = 1); K (n = 1); R (n = 1);
and U (n = 1). Seventeen BstEII profiles were detected
among 142 isolates: C1 (n = 71); C17 (n = 49); C5 (n =
5); C9 (n = 3); C16 (n = 2) and single isolates with C10,
C18, C22, C27, C29, C35, C36, C38, C39, S4, I4 and I5.
Ten different combined PstI-BstEII profiles were recorded
among the 88 isolates that were characterised with both
enzymes: B-C1 (n = 42); B-C17 (n = 36); B-C9 (n = 3) and
single isolates of B-C5, B-C16, G-C35, I-C29, K-C17, R-I4
and U-C16. The B-C17 profile was predominant in Scot-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/212

land in this cohort of isolates, specifically in the regions of
Aberdeenshire, Angus, Borders and Perth and Kinross
(Table 1 and see supplementary dataset in Additional file
1 and Additional file 2: Table S1). The C1 profile was
more widely spread across Europe and was found in the
Czech Republic, Greece, Finland, The Netherlands, Norway and Spain, (Table 1 and see supplementary dataset in
Additional file 1 and Additional file 2: Table S1).
PFGE typing
PFGE typing data were obtained for 145 Map isolates
(Table 1 and Figure 1). Twenty four different SnaBI profiles were detected in this panel of isolates: 2 (n = 91); 1
(n = 15); 15 (n = 9); 29 (n = 4); 34 (n = 4); 3 (n = 3); 38
(n = 2) and 5, 9, 16, 18, 20, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 36, 37,
39, 40, 41, 58 (n = 1 each); and 23 distinct SpeI profiles:
1 (n = 102); 25 (n = 8); 2, 15, 22 (n = 4 each); 17, 19, 21,
30, 32 (n = 2 each) and 7, 10, 11, 16, 18, 20, 23, 24, 27,
28, 29, 31, 64 (n = 1 each). The combination of both
enzyme profiles gave 31 different multiplex profiles: [2-1]
(n = 83); [1-1] (n = 15); [15-25] (n = 8); [29-15],[34-22]
(n = 4 each); [3-2] (n = 3); [2-19],[2-30],[38-32] (n = 2
each) and [2-10], [2-17], [2-21], [2-31], [5-2], [9-7], [1516], [16-11], [18-1], [20-1], [26-1], [27-18], [30-21], [3117], [32-29], [33-20], [36-27], [37-23], [39-24], [40-28],
[41-1],[58-64] (n = 1 each). By far the most widely distributed PFGE type was [2-1], which was found in the Czech
Republic, Finland, The Netherlands, Norway, Scotland
and Spain (Table 1 and see supplementary dataset in
Additional file 1 and Additional file 2: Table S1). PFGE
type [1-1] was the next most common occurring in the
Czech Republic, Finland, The Netherlands and Spain
(Table 1 and see supplementary dataset in Additional file
1 and Additional file 2: Table S1). Profile [2-30] was
found in The Netherlands and Scotland and the other profiles were found in only one country (Table 1 and see supplementary dataset in Additional file 1 and Additional file
2: Table S1). The numbers of isolates detected with these
profiles are too small to determine if these multiplex profiles truly are restricted in their geographical location.
AFLP typing
A representative subset of 68 Map isolates in the typing
panel were analysed by AFLP. The DNA restriction patterns generated by EcoRI and MseI showed patterns that
met the conditions for analyses such as fragment sizes,
number of bands and ratio of fully versus partially
digested fragments. The Map isolates, as a group, clearly
clustered differently from other mycobacterial species
such as Mycobacterium marinum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis
and M. phlei. However, within the group of Map isolates a
low degree of genetic diversity was detected, with isolates
displaying between 90 and 95% homology. The reproducibility of the technique was assessed and it was concluded
that on average the calculated similarities using the Pear-

son product-moment correlation between AFLP typing
repeats was 85 to 90%. Since the variation detected
between repeat analyses was in the same range as the
genetic variation detected between Map isolates it was
concluded that AFLP could not discriminate effectively
between isolates and no further Map isolates were typed
using this procedure.
MIRU-VNTR typing
One hundred and forty seven Map isolates were typed by
MIRU-VNTR and 23 different types were obtained (Table
1 and see supplementary dataset in Additional file 1). In
addition, MIRU-VNTR types INMV 23 and 28 were
obtained for the two IS901 positive M. avium isolates. The
following MIRU-VNTR types were exhibited by Map isolates in this study: INMV 1 (n = 75); 2 (n = 35); 26 (n = 9);
6 (n = 4), 37 (n = 3), 8, 25, 35 (n = 2); 5, 13, 19, 20, 21,
22, 24, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 36, 38, 69 (n = 1). INMV 1 and
2 were the most widely disseminated MIRU-VNTR types,
both occurring in the Czech Republic, Finland, The Netherlands, Scotland and Spain (Table 1 and see supplementary dataset in Additional file 1 and Additional file 2:
Table S1). INMV 1 also was found in Norway and INMV
2 in Greece (Table 1 and see supplementary dataset in
Additional file 1 and Additional file 2: Table S1). The relative frequencies of the various alleles were calculated and
are shown in Table 2. The allelic diversity observed is consistent with the previous report [22].
Comparison of typing techniques
A predominance of one or two types was observed with all
of the typing techniques and these predominant types
could be further discriminated by one or both of the other
typing methods (Table 3). For example, the predominant
PFGE multiplex type [2-1] comprising 83 isolates was subdivided into nine different profiles by MIRU-VNTR and
seven different profiles by BstEII IS900-RFLP. PFGE multiplex type [1-1] comprising 15 isolates could be subdivided into three INMV profiles and three BstEII IS900RFLP patterns. Minor multiplex profiles [2-30], [29-15]
and [34-22] were each subdivided into two by MIRUVNTR. The major MIRU-VNTR type INMV1 consisting of
75 isolates was split by PFGE into 11 and by BstEII IS900RFLP into four subtypes. INMV2 composed of 35 isolates
was subdivided into eight and seven types by PFGE and
BstEII IS900-RFLP, respectively. The minor groups INMV
6, 8, 25, 26 and 35 were each subdivided by PFGE into a
further two types and INMV 25 into two BstEII types. Both
PFGE and MIRU-VNTR each differentiated the most widespread BstEII IS900-RFLP type C1, which included 71 isolates, into 14 and 11 distinct types, respectively. The BstEII
type C17 comprising 49 isolates was subdivided into four
types by each of the other typing methods. The minor
types C5 and C9 were further subdivided into three and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/212

two, respectively, by PFGE and VNTR-MIRU subdivided
C16 into two types. By combining PFGE and VNTR-MIRU
or all three typing techniques it was possible to discriminate 37 and 44 patterns, respectively (Table 4 and see
Additional file 2: Table S2).
Genetic diversity
Simpson's Index of Diversity (SID) with 95% confidence
intervals for the individual typing techniques and their
combinations based on the analysis of 123 Map isolates
for which results were obtained by the IS900-RFLP, PFGE
and MIRU-VNTR methods are given in Table 4. SID values
are given for the combined European dataset (all isolates),
for the Scottish isolates and for the isolates from mainland Europe. When comparing SIDs, differences were considered statistically significant when there were no
overlaps between the confidence intervals. The phylogenetic relationships between the isolates are shown in Figure 1 using PFGE data.
Distribution among different host species
Map isolates from three domestic species of ruminants
and 14 different wildlife species, a feral cat and a captive
giraffe were typed (Table 1 and see supplementary dataset
in Additional file 1 and Additional file 2: Table S3). The
wildlife encompassed both ruminant and non-ruminant
species. Among the wildlife species, feral cat and captive
giraffe, a total of nine IS900-RFLP, nine PFGE and six
INMV types were detected.

In order to make a preliminary assessment of transmission dynamics, the combined typing data from all three
molecular techniques was considered, as this was most
discriminatory. A total of seven combined profiles were
detected in isolates from more than one host species ([11], INMV1, C1; [1-1], INMV2, C1; [2-1], INMV1, C1; [21], INMV1, C17; [2-1], INMV2, C1; [2-19], INMV2, C5;
[3-2], INMV1, C17) (Table 1). The evidence for interspecies transmission is more compelling if the same strain
types are isolated from multiple species on the same property. Even with the limited data available on the properties
from which the isolates in the study were obtained, it was
possible to show that two combined profiles ([2-1],
INMV1, C17 and ([2-19], INMV2, C5) were found in
more than one species on the same property in seven cases
(Table 5). Of these, four properties included isolates from
both livestock and wildlife (EN, DR, I and R). The properties CF, DR and I, are all located within the geographical
area of Perth and Kinross and EN, GE and R in the adjacent region of Angus in Scotland. Isolates from species on
all six of these properties had the same combined profile
([2-1], INMV1, C17). Profile [2-19], INMV2, C5 was
obtained from a goat and a sheep on the same property in
Greece.

of IS900-RFLP, PFGE, AFLP and MIRU-VNTR for the
molecular characterization of Map isolates. AFLP could
not effectively discriminate between Map isolates and
therefore is not suitable for epidemiological studies on
paratuberculosis. A major problem with the technique
was reproducibility. This was probably due in part to the
variable quality of the mycobacterial DNA, which is
highly dependent on growth phase and difficult to extract
from Map isolates that are particularly resilient to lysis.
Reproducibility could also have been affected by small
variations in the experimental procedure such as shifts in
electrophoretic mobility during capillary electrophoresis.
Despite several attempts using alternative analytical procedures, no decrease in this variation could be obtained.

Dendrograms showing the genetic relationships

Map isolates analysed in the study. The similarity coefficients were calculated using Dice and hierarchical cluster
analysis of the data was performed using the unweighted pair
group method with arithmetic means.
Limited data was available for two properties in the Czech
Republic, KRH and VO. On these properties the combined
typing profiles of the isolates showed that they were not
the same in all the species sampled. The PFGE multiplex
profile [2-1] was found on VO in isolates from both a cow
and a hare but IS900-RFLP analysis showed the hare isolate to have a different profile to the cow. The two deer on
property KRH had a different profile to that of a cow on
the same farm.

Discussion
The results of this study improve our knowledge of the
epidemiology of paratuberculosis in Europe regarding the
genetic diversity and distribution of Map isolates with
respect to geographic location and host species of origin.
The study has also permitted a comprehensive comparison of three standardized typing procedures, the results of
which will inform future epidemiological studies as to the
most appropriate and discriminative methods to employ.

The most widely used measure of diversity is Simpson's
Index of Diversity (SID), which we have employed here to
estimate the discriminatory power of the various molecular typing techniques utilised in this study. When all Map
isolates were considered irrespective of host or geographic
origin, the SID was not significantly different between
each of the individual typing techniques (IS900-RFLP,
multiplex PFGE and MIRU-VNTR) and was low at a value
between 0.636 and 0.664 in accordance with previous
reports [23,24]. The SID value is strongly influenced by
the distribution of types rather than the number of types
detected. This is clearly demonstrated by comparing the
two methods with the largest difference in the number of
patterns detected i.e. IS900-RFLP, which identified 15 profiles and multiplex PFGE, which detected 26 profiles.
Despite the number of profiles detected, both methods
have almost the same SID point estimate and 95% confidence interval. The SID for IS900-RFLP could have been
improved further had it been possible to obtain PstI profiles for the isolates. The discriminatory power of the individual techniques is too low for epidemiological surveys
since a SID of around 0.9 is generally considered the minimum. For isolates from mainland Europe, SID for the
combination of multiplex PFGE and MIRU-VNTR, with or
without IS900-RFLP, exceeded the threshold value of 0.9.
The increase in SID is not surprising since the different
typing techniques target different sources of genetic variation and have different limitations and will therefore
complement each other when used in combination. Due
to limited heterogeneity among Scottish isolates, combining all three typing techniques increased SID to 0.879 for
the dataset as a whole, providing discriminatory power
close to the minimum but not quite reaching the target
value.
Although the combination of all three typing techniques
gives the greatest discrimination, this is generally not practical or cost effective for large national or international

studies and often a compromise is sought. The choice of
typing method will be influenced by the predominant isolate type in the population to be tested. This is highlighted
in this study by considering the data shown in Table 4 for
the isolates from Scotland versus those from mainland
Europe and the combined European dataset (i.e. all isolates). The isolates from Scotland comprise a homogeneous population in which the B-C17 IS900-RFLP profile
predominates and is therefore a rigorous test for the combination approach. Comparing the SIDs for the various
combinations of typing techniques there was no difference between multiplex PFGE + MIRU-VNTR and the

combination of all three typing techniques. Therefore, a
combination of multiplex PFGE + MIRU-VNTR would be
suitable for epidemiological studies in Scotland. A combination of multiplex PFGE + MIRU-VNTR would also be
appropriate for mainland Europe but here a combination
of IS900-RFLP and multiplex PFGE would also perform
well. The best combination for the combined European
dataset was all three typing techniques. The SID for the
isolates from mainland Europe was often higher than that
for the combined European dataset, the latter being
affected by the inclusion of the less heterogeneous Scottish isolates. Based on these results a small pilot study of

the population of interest is recommended before undertaking a large epidemiological survey. For further epidemiological studies in Scotland, it would be advantageous
to undertake a pilot study including short sequence repeat
analysis [25], which may improve the discriminatory
power for this homogeneous population of isolates.
The study identified the common isolate types within the
European countries examined. IS900-RFLP profile C1 was
the most widespread, consistent with previous reports
from individual countries [26-31]. This profile has a global distribution, being found in the United States, Australia and New Zealand [10,30,32]. Although IS900-RFLP
profile C17 is commonly isolated in Scotland it is
reported to be relatively rare in other European countries
[30,31]. It was identified in isolates from The Netherlands
and Norway in this study and has been reported previously in Germany [31] and is predominant in specific
regions of Argentina [30,33]. The most common PFGE
profile was [2-1] found in six of the seven countries examined, closely followed by [1-1] found in four. INVM 2 was

Numbers in parenthesis indicate the number of animals of that species
identified with the given typing profile

found in six countries and INVM 1 in five. Further investigations will be required to determine if this distribution is
a consequence of animal movements, increased virulence
or whether these isolates have characteristics that allow
them to transmit more readily. There is evidence to suggest that different mycobacterial strain types vary in their
ability to cause disease. Caws et al. [34] provided evidence
that M. tuberculosis genotype influences clinical disease
phenotype and demonstrated a significant interaction
between host and bacterial genotypes and the development of tuberculosis. Gollnick et al. [35] reported that the
survival of Map in bovine monocyte-derived macrophages
was not affected by host infection status but by the infecting strain type. Two recent studies suggest that different
Map strain types may play a role in polarizing the host
immune responses during infection [36,37]. Also, different Map strains have been found to differ in virulence in
experimental infections of deer [38] and in a mouse
model (KS, unpublished data) and Verna et al. have provided data to show how the strain type may influence the
pathology of ovine paratuberculosis [39].
Surprisingly, no Type I strains (corresponding to S Type
strains in the literature [40]) were identified within the 27
sheep and 33 goat field isolates submitted by the partners.
This may be a reflection of the difficulties encountered in
isolating and growing these strains in vitro. Typically, isolates of strain Type I are slow-growing, taking longer than
16 weeks and sometimes as long as 18 months to isolate
on solid medium. Cultures are often not retained this long
in diagnostic laboratories. Furthermore, studies have
shown that the decontamination procedures or media
used for isolation can significantly affect recovery of these
strains. Reddacliff et al. [41] reported the detrimental
effects of various decontamination protocols on the

recovery of Type I strains from tissues and faeces. The
addition of egg yolk and mycobactin J to BACTEC 12B or
7H9 broth was found to be essential for the isolation of
Australian sheep strains from faeces and to enhance their
recovery from tissue samples [42]. Other workers have
successfully isolated Type I or III strains on LJ or Middlebrook 7H11 supplemented with mycobactin J [43,44].
The addition of antibiotics can also affect growth. Both
ampicillin and vancomycin hydrochloride can retard
growth of Type I strains [45]. The various laboratories participating in this study used a range of decontamination
procedures and culture media but it is not possible to rule
out a culture bias.
The results of this survey highlight an interesting difference between the epidemiology of Map in Europe and
Australia. This study shows that in Europe, Type II strains
(corresponding to C Type strains in the literature [10]) are
commonly isolated from sheep, goats and cattle whereas
in Australia, Type II strains are rarely, if ever, isolated from
sheep -the predominant type being Type I. We can only
speculate as to the reasons for this difference. Management practices will affect the circulation of strains and can
differ between some parts of Europe and Australia. The
scale of farming operations and relative proportions of the
different livestock co- or sequentially grazing may also be
a factor. Paratuberculosis is more common in sheep in
Australia than in cattle and the Type I strain is more virulent for sheep than cattle [39].
In this study, Map was isolated from 19 different host species, which included both ruminants and non-ruminants.
This is the first report of the isolation of Map from a
giraffe. The Type II strains appear to have greater propensity for infecting a broad range of host species whereas the
epidemiological data available for Type I strains suggests
that they have a preference for sheep and goats [23]. Since
our results show that the same profiles are found in isolates from different species, it strongly suggests that strain
sharing occurs. Even more convincing was the observation
that the same profiles were isolated from wildlife species
and domestic ruminants on the same farm. The frequency
or ease with which interspecies transmission occurs are
unknown entities and require further investigation. Similarly, the relative risk of transmission from domestic livestock to wildlife or vice versa remains to be determined.
All animals in contact with Map contaminated faeces on
an infected property will contribute to the spread of disease through passive transmission. However, Map infects
a variety of wildlife host species that potentially could be
reservoirs for infection of domestic livestock and have
serious implications for control of paratuberculosis. The
role of wildlife reservoirs in the epidemiology of paratuberculosis will depend on a number of factors which need

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/212

to be taken into consideration when undertaking a risk
assessment for interspecies transmission. Although Map
can infect many wildlife species, only wild ruminants and
lagomorphs show evidence of disease as determined by
the presence of gross or microscopic lesions with associated acid fast bacteria [46]. These wildlife species have the
capacity to excrete Map and spread disease to other susceptible species primarily through further faecal contamination of the environment. Potentially, they could
constitute wildlife reservoirs. By definition, to constitute a
wildlife reservoir the infection would need to be sustained
within the species population. Evidence is available for
vertical, pseudovertical and horizontal transmission
within natural rabbit populations which could contribute
to the maintenance of Map infections within such populations [47,48].
The other wildlife species in this study could be categorised into predators and scavengers that probably acquire
the disease through eating contaminated prey or carrion,
respectively. It has been reported previously that these
animals show no clinical signs of disease and only minor
histopathological changes with a few acid fast bacteria in
tissues [4,5]. Such infected predators and scavengers are
probably 'dead-end hosts' and are not high risk factors for
interspecies transmission.
Information pertaining to strain types can assist in designing and evaluating disease control programmes. It is beneficial to know the predominant strain type in a
population or the virulence of a particular strain type particularly for developing new vaccines. Singh et al. [49]
recently reported the effectiveness and advantage of using
a vaccine based on a local 'bison-type' strain.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this survey has helped to expand our
knowledge to improve our understanding of the epidemiology of paratuberculosis. It is hoped that the information
provided will facilitate future surveys and research strategies to resolve the outstanding epidemiological questions
regarding this disease.
The results of this study were in agreement with previous
reports indicating that Map isolates comprise a relatively
homogeneous population exhibiting little genetic diversity compared with other bacterial pathogens. As a result
it is necessary to use multiple genotyping techniques targeting different sources of genetic variation to obtain the
level of discrimination necessary to investigate transmission dynamics and trace the source of infections. Identical
genotypes were obtained from Map isolated from different host species co-habiting on the same property strongly
suggesting that interspecies transmission occurs. Interspecies transmission of Map between wildlife species and

Page 9 of 13

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:212

domestic livestock on the same farm provides further evidence to support a role for wildlife reservoirs of infection.
However, in assessing the relative risk of transmission
between wildlife and domestic livestock, distinction
needs to be made between passive and active transmission
as well as the potential for contact.

Methods
Bacteria
A total of 166 suspected Map isolates were obtained from
the Czech Republic (n = 27), Finland (n = 5), Greece (n =
6), The Netherlands (n = 46), Norway (n = 7), Scotland (n
= 54) and Spain (n = 21) (Table 1 and see supplementary
dataset in Additional file 1). The isolates from livestock
species were obtained from animals showing symptoms
of paratuberculosis and from various clinical samples (see
supplementary dataset in Additional file 1) that were submitted to the various laboratories for diagnosis. In the
case of isolates from wildlife species, these were isolated
from wildlife on properties with a known history or current problem with paratuberculosis and these animals did
not necessarily show any clinical signs. The isolates were
cultured from 19 different host species (supplementary
dataset in Additional file 1 and Additional file 2: Table
S3). Isolates were propagated on slopes of one of the following media depending on what was used routinely in
the supply laboratories:- modified Middlebrook 7H11
supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated newborn calf serum, 2.5% (vol/vol) glycerol, 2 mM asparagine, 10% (vol/vol) Middlebrook oleic acid-albumindextrose-catalase (OADC) enrichment medium (Becton
Dickinson, Oxford, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom), Selectatabs (code MS 24; MAST Laboratories Ltd., Merseyside,
United Kingdom), and 2 μg ml-1 mycobactin J (Allied
Monitor, Fayette, Mo.); Herrold's egg yolk medium with 2
μg ml-1 mycobactin J or Lowenstein-Jensen medium with
2 μg ml-1 mycobactin J. For the typing panel, three Map
isolates were included to represent the three strain types
described in Map [11,12]. In addition, three isolates (one
bovine, one ovine and one caprine) were duplicated in the
panel as internal controls for the reproducibility of the
typing methods and M. bovis BCG, M. phlei and IS901 positive M. avium (it is not known if this isolate is M. avium
subsp. avium or M. avium subsp. silvaticum) were included
as negative controls. The isolates were coded with an EU
reference number (see supplementary dataset in Additional file 1) and genotyped in a blind study.
IS900-RFLP method
The typing laboratories were provided either with cultures
or with DNA in agarose plugs that had been prepared for
PFGE typing. DNA extraction from cultures and IS900RFLP analysis was performed using the standardized procedure published by Pavlik et al. [50]. Where plugs were
provided, the restriction digests were carried out in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/212

presence of agarose as described for PFGE [51]. Briefly, a
3-5 mm insert of agarose was cut from the plug, washed
extensively in TE buffer and pre-incubated with the appropriate restriction buffer containing 0.1 mg ml-1 BSA. After
one hr the buffer was discarded and replaced with fresh
buffer containing the restriction endonuclease and incubated overnight at 37°C. The agarose containing the
digested DNA was then loaded into the wells of an agarose
gel as described in the standardized procedure [51]. New
profiles were designations assigned by the National Veterinary Institute, Brno using the standard nomenclature
described. Profiles were analysed using Gel Compar
(Biomathematics, Belgium).
PFGE analysis
PFGE analysis was carried out using SnaBI and SpeI
according to the published standardized procedure of Stevenson et al. [11] with the following modifications. Plugs
were prepared to give a density of 1.2 × 1010 cells ml-1 and
the incubation time in lysis buffer was increased to 48 hr.
The concentration of lysozyme was increased to 4 mg ml1. Incubation with proteinase K was carried out for a total
of seven days and the enzyme was refreshed after four
days. Restriction endonuclease digestion of plug DNA by
SpeI was performed with 10 U overnight in the appropriate restriction endonuclease buffer supplemented with
0.1 mg ml-1 BSA, after which the enzyme was refreshed
and incubated for a further 6 hr. The parameters for electrophoresis of SpeI restriction fragments were changed to
separate fragments of between 20 and 250 Kb as determined by the CHEF MAPPER and electrophoresis was performed for 40 hr. The modified conditions are available
on the website [51]. Gel images were captured using an
AlphaImager 2200 (Alpha Innotech). Profiles were analysed using Bionumerics Maths™ software (Applied
Maths, Belgium).
AFLP analysis
A loop of cells from a culture tube was resuspended in 1
ml H2O. The optical density was adjusted to 1 McFarland
unit in order to standardize the performance of the subsequent DNA extraction. DNA was extracted using Instagene
Matrix (Bio-Rad™) according to the manufacturer's
instructions.

100 ng template DNA was digested for 2 hr with 1 unit
EcoRI and MseI at 37°C. The 10 μl mixture contained: 5
μl template DNA, 1.0 μl (10×) BSA, 1.0 μl NEB 2 buffer,
0.05 μl EcoRI, 0.1 μl Mse I (NEB) and H2O and was incubated for 2 hr at 37°C.

to the digested DNA by adding 5 μl of the ligation mixture
(0.6 μl Eco-adaptor, 0.6 μl Mse-adaptor, 0.3 μl T4-ligase
(NEB, 1 unit), 1.5 μl 5 M NaCl, 1.5 μl ligase buffer (10×)
(NEB) and 0.5 μl H2O) to 10 μl of the RE-digestion mixture, followed by 2 hr incubation at 16°C.
The amplification reaction was carried out in a 10 μl mixture containing 5.0 μl DNA from the adaptor-ligation
reaction, 1.2 μl H2O, 0.2 μl dNTP (10 mM), 1.0 μl PCR
buffer (10× PCR buffer II, ABI), 0.6 μl MgCl2 (25 mM), 1.2
μl Mse-0 primer (50 ng μl-1) and 0.2 μl Amplitaq Taq
polymerase (5 U). The PCR cycling conditions were: hold
2 min 72°C, 12 cycles: (30 sec, 65°C touch down 0.7 C
per cycle, 60 sec 72°C), 23 cycles: (30 sec, 56 C, 60 sec,

The PCR product was run on a capillary automated
sequencer (ABI 3100 avant). The AFLP profiles were analysed with the Bionumerics software programme (Applied
Maths).

MIRU-VNTR analysis
DNA in agarose plugs prepared for PFGE analysis was
used for MIRU-VNTR analysis. Small pieces of agarose
plug, approximately 2 mm thick, were washed in TE buffer
(pH 8) to remove residual EDTA in the storage buffer.
One hundred microlitres of TE buffer were added to the
agarose and the sample boiled for 10 min to melt the agarose and denature the DNA. Five microlitres (80 ng) were
used for PCR and the MIRU-VNTR analysis was performed
as described by Thibault et al. [22] detecting eight polymorphic loci. The allelic diversity (h) at a locus was calculated as h = 1 - Σxi2 [n/(n - 1)], where xi is the frequency of
the ith allele at the locus, and n the number of isolates
[52,53].
Strain type analysis by PCR
Isolates were typed to differentiate between strain types I
or II using the PCR reported by Dohmann et al.
(2003)[17].
Calculation of the discriminatory power
Simpson's index of diversity (SID) described by Hunter
and Gaston [54] was used as a numerical index for the discriminatory power of PFGE, IS900-RFLP and VNTR and
combinations of these typing methods. The SID was calculated using the data from 123 isolates that were typed
with all three typing procedures using the following formula:
