Abstract
Background: Oceans cover approximately 70% of the Earth's surface with an average depth of
3800 m and a pressure of 38 MPa, thus a large part of the biosphere is occupied by high pressure
environments. Piezophilic (pressure-loving) organisms are adapted to deep-sea life and grow
optimally at pressures higher than 0.1 MPa. To better understand high pressure adaptation from a
genomic point of view three different Photobacterium profundum strains were compared. Using the
sequenced piezophile P. profundum strain SS9 as a reference, microarray technology was used to
identify the genomic regions missing in two other strains: a pressure adapted strain (named DSJ4)
and a pressure-sensitive strain (named 3TCK). Finally, the transcriptome of SS9 grown under
different pressure (28 MPa; 45 MPa) and temperature (4°C; 16°C) conditions was analyzed taking
into consideration the differentially expressed genes belonging to the flexible gene pool.
Results: These studies indicated the presence of a large flexible gene pool in SS9 characterized by
various horizontally acquired elements. This was verified by extensive analysis of GC content,
codon usage and genomic signature of the SS9 genome. 171 open reading frames (ORFs) were
found to be specifically absent or highly divergent in the piezosensitive strain, but present in the
two piezophilic strains. Among these genes, six were found to also be up-regulated by high
pressure.
Conclusion: These data provide information on horizontal gene flow in the deep sea, provide
additional details of P. profundum genome expression patterns and suggest genes which could
perform critical functions for abyssal survival, including perhaps high pressure growth.

Background
Piezophilic microbes have been isolated from a variety of
abyssal and hadal deep-sea environments and include
several psychrophilic or psychrotolerant proteobacteria,
and several high temperature Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota [1]. While the study of these extremophiles is still
in its infancy, both physiological and structural adaptations appear to be important for high-pressure life.
One moderately piezophilic, gamma-proteobacterial isolate, Photobacterium profundum strain SS9, has been the
subject of a number of studies addressing the nature and
regulation of genes important for pressure-sensing and
high pressure adaptation, owing to the relative ease of its
cultivation as well as its genetic tractability [1]. Here we
make use of another important P. profundum feature,
namely the availability of multiple closely related strains
which differ in their pressure and temperature optima.
Strain SS9 was isolated from an amphipod in the Sulu
Trough at a depth of 2551 m and displays optimum
growth at 28 MPa and 15°C [2]. P. profundum strain DSJ4
was recovered from a sediment sample obtained from the
Ryukyu Trench (Japan) at a depth of 5110 m and displays
its optimum growth at 10 MPa (with little change in
growth at pressures up to 50 MPa) and a temperature optimum of 10°C [3]. P. profundum strain 3TCK was isolated
from a shallow sediment sample obtained from San
Diego Bay (California, U. S. A.) and exhibits optimal
growth at atmospheric pressure and a broad temperature
span for growth from below 0°C to above 20°C.
Recently, the complete genome sequence of strain SS9 was
obtained [4]. This achievement has enabled the scaling up
of the study of piezophily and, more generally, of adaptations to the deep sea (i.e., low temperature, low nutrient
input, absence of sunlight), at the genomic level. In this
study a microarray covering nearly the complete SS9
genome was used to investigate both the flexible gene
pool (genes whose presence is variable due to insertion/
deletion events) and high pressure adaptation by means
of two different post-genomic approaches:
1-Using the SS9 genome as a reference, comparative
genomic hybridization experiments were performed with
DNA extracted from the other two P. profundum strains
(DSJ4 and 3TCK) to identify the flexible gene pool in SS9.
To determine if these genes were obtained from lateral
gene transfer events or, conversely, from genomic reduction events in the other strains, their GC content, codon
usage and genomic signature was analyzed.
2-Transcriptome analyses were performed as a function of
pressure (0.1, 28 and 45 MPa at 16°C) and temperature
(4°C vs. 16°C at 0.1 MPa). Although we have recently
presented preliminary data on SS9 expression at 0.1 and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/122

28 MPa, in this study temperature effects on gene regulation were compared with pressure effects since increasing
pressure exerts some common effects with decreasing
temperature in terms of membrane microviscosity and
with increasing temperature in terms of protein stability
[5]. Moreover the transcriptional changes identified in the
0.1 MPa vs. 28 MPa and 28 MPa vs. 45 MPa experiments
were compared in order to reveal expression changes in a
piezophilic bacterial species grown at supra-optimal
pressure.
Finally, the results obtained from comparative genomic
analyses and expression profiling experiments were combined to identify genes shared among the P. profundum
piezophiles, absent from the piezosensitive strain, and
up-regulated at high pressure. This allowed a few genes to
be selected from a pool of approximately 6,000 genes
whose distribution and expression characteristics suggest
possible function in high pressure adaptation and thus
present themselves as candidates for future genetic
investigation.

Results
Comparison of three P. profundum strains
Amplification and analysis of the 16S rDNA from strain
3TCK revealed that it is 97.7% identical at the 16S level
with Photobacterium profundum SS9 and 98.7% identical to
P. profundum DSJ4, suggesting that they are all members of
the same species. Figure 1 shows a 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic tree demonstrating the relationship among
selected Photobacterium species, including the three P. profundum strains selected for this study. Growth curves
showed that 3TCK is psychrotolerant and piezo-sensitive.
However it grows at higher temperatures than P. profundum SS9 and DSJ4 (data not shown) and has faster growth
rates at 0.1 MPa.
Genomic comparison between different P. profundum
strains
The first question that arises from the genomic comparison between SS9 and the other two strains is: "how many
SS9 genes are missing or highly divergent in the 3TCK and
DSJ4 genomes?". 544 ORFs were determined to be absent
in 3TCK strain genome, 313 (9.1% of the ORFs located on
chr1) belong to the SS9 chr1 and 231 (11.5% of the ORFs
located on chr2) to chr2. 562 ORFs are absent in the DSJ4
genome, 292 (8.5%) are located on SS9 chr1 and 270
(13.5%) on chr2.

An interesting aspect of these data is that for both strains
the percentage of missing/divergent regions is higher on
chr2 than chr1. This indicates that chr2 (Figure 2) contains a proportionally larger flexible gene pool and that it
has been the target of more gene transfer events for its size
(~2.2 Mbp) than chr1 (~4.1 Mbp) that contains the most

"established" genes. This is also true for other Vibrionaceae
genomes [6].
In order to define if the regions absent in the 3TCK-DSJ4
strains could be considered to have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer we performed three different analyses: GC content variation (Figure 2, 9th circle),
tetranucleotide composition (genomic signature) (Figure
2, 10th circle) [7,8] and codon bias relative to the average
gene versus S3 percentage (G+C content of codon site 3)
(Figure 3 and Additional file 1) [9].
Taken together these three different analyses were able to
identify a large number of potentially laterally transferred
regions. For example, a region named Chr1.11 (named for
its chromosome location and clockwise order of position,
Figure 2) has an altered tetranucleotide composition but
its GC content is similar to the surrounding regions and it
has a "normal" codon bias relative to the average gene versus S3 percentage (data not shown). Conversely, region
Chr2.1 is only characterized by a slight GC content variation. The results obtained from these analyses are discussed in-depth below.
A BLASTP similarity search of SS9 proteins identified various phage-related proteins, mostly encoded in three
regions named Chr1.8, Chr2.3 and Chr2.5. Microarray
data obtained by comparing the SS9, 3TCK and DSJ4
genomes (Figure 2) confirmed that these genomic portions are absent in both the 3TCK and DSJ4. These regions
present characteristics typical of a genomic island (GI):

Chr1.8 (46.8 kbp) has an altered tetranucleotide composition and presents twelve phage-related proteins, one of
these (PBPRA1336) encodes a putative integrase protein.
Nevertheless this region lacks the other two characteristics
of a typical GI: GC content anomalies and the presence of
a tRNA gene at one end. This region also contains two
genes, encoding tryptophanase (TnaA) (PBPRA1344) and
a hypothetical tryptophan-specific transport protein
(PBPRA1345), involved in tryptophan transport and
metabolism, and 27 hypothetical or conserved hypothetical proteins.
The region Chr2.3 is located on chr2, spans approximately
42.4 kbp, has no GC content anomalies (41.1%) but has
a slightly altered tetranucleotide composition. Chr2.3
contains twelve ORFs that have similarity with phage proteins, one of these being a hypothetical integrase
(PBPRB0551). Moreover it encodes a putative NAD(P)H
oxidoreductase (PBPRB0548) and a putative TrkA family
protein (glutathione-regulated potassium efflux system
protein) (PBPRB0550). Furthermore PBPRB0559 gene
has similarities with enterohemolysin 1, a gene also
present in the Gifsy-1 prophage, and PBPRB0560 has similarities with exodeoxyribonuclease of the Gifsy-2
prophage of Salmonella typhimurium LT2 [11].
Chr2.5 region appears to be completely absent in DSJ4
whereas only the first part is absent in 3TCK. Chr2.5 contains a hypothetical integrase gene (PBPRB1271), twelve
phage related proteins and various hypothetical proteins.
The higher GC content (46.2%) of Chr2.5 suggests that it
has been acquired more recently than Chr1.8 and Chr2.3.
A large part of the genes located in the Chr1.8, Chr2.3 and
Chr2.5 regions clearly lacks orthologous genes in others
bacteria [12] such as V. cholerae, V. vulnificus (strains
CMCP6 and YJ016), V. parahaemolyticus, V. fisheri, E. coli,
and B. subtilis. The high number of hypothetical proteins
encoded in these regions suggests that these loci could
have been acquired from bacteria still unknown. Consistent with its recent acquisition Chr2.5 presents an altered
codon bias and a large percentage of its ORFs are located
on the right horn of a graph of the codon bias versus the
GC content frequency in third position (Additional file
1).
A large 69.1 kbp element (Chr2.7-PI for Plasmid Integration) is present only in strain SS9 and seems to be the
result of plasmid integration into the chromosome. This
region has a high GC content and altered codon bias and

temperature growth defects. This raises the question of the
function of the genes located on the plasmid which must
be playing some role in environmental adaptation for the
plasmid to be retained [16].

Figure 3for lateral gene transfer in SS9
Evidence
Evidence for lateral gene transfer in SS9. Each P. profundum
gene of ≥ 200 codons is represented in this graph by a point
with co-ordinates corresponding to its codon bias relative to
average gene and G+C frequency of codon site three. Genes
having G+C frequency lower than 0.28 and codon bias higher
than 0.35 correspond to the left horn. Genes having G+C
frequency higher than 0.46 and codon bias higher than 0.35
correspond to the right horn. Genes absent in 3TCK and/or
DSJ4 genomes (highlighted in black) are more frequent in
horn regions (64% in left horn, 66% in right horn) respect to
the middle region (10% of ORFs). The low number of strains
analyzed leads to an underestimation of the laterally transferred regions in SS9 and this probably accounts for those
genes localized in left and right horn which are present in all
three P. profundum strains analyzed.

genomic signature. Various bacterial conjugation factors
(TrbCDEJBFGI and TraFLGIKL) are present in this element. These genes are typically found in widespread conjugationally transmitted plasmids [13]. This element
carries a large number of genes, but of particular interest
is a multidrug efflux system (PBPRB1635, PBPRB1637,
PBPRB1638).
SS9 also contains a 80 kbp plasmid (named "plasmid" in
Table 1) that shows similarity with V. vulnificus plasmid
YJ016 at least in the region spanning the genes related to
conjugation. This plasmid is absent in both DSJ4 and
3TCK and presents characteristics of horizontally transferred DNA, in fact various ORFs belonging to this element are localized to the right horn of Figure 3 (see also
Additional file 1).
PCR examination for the presence of this plasmid in various laboratory derivatives of P. profundum SS9 has
revealed that it can be lost: strain TW30 [14] is a toxRderivative of DB110 [15] which lacks the plasmid (Additional file 2), yet TW30 exhibits no pressure or

One of the most interesting results obtained from the
annotation process was the finding that in the SS9
genome there are two flagellar clusters. One of these (tentatively identified as the polar flagella cluster, PF) is
located on chr1 between 993676 and 1046789 bp and the
second cluster (tentatively identified as the lateral flagella
cluster, Chr1.1-LF) is localized on chr1 near the origin
between 13496 and 49254 bp. Similarity searches
revealed that the PF region contains most of the genes
involved in polar flagellum assembly, with a gene organization typical of a Vibrionaceae polar flagellar cluster [17].
Chr1.1-LF contains all the genes involved in lateral flagellar synthesis and most of the genes localized in this region
have similarity with the flagellar cluster of V. parahaemolyticus that codes for lateral flagella [18]. This region is
absent only in 3TCK strain (Figure 2).
Finally, the data on variable regions was compared with
the transcriptome results to discern if any of the horizontally acquired genes might be indicated to perform a role
in pressure or temperature adaptation. The absolute fluorescence value from microarray analysis indicates that the
expression levels of most of these genes was quite low.
Indeed, only three regions in chr1 (Chr1.13, Chr1.14,
Chr1.15) and two in chr2 (Chr2.8, Chr2.9) had fluorescence values higher than the mean fluorescence level of
the entire chromosome (Table 1 and Figure 2, 11th circle).
Region Chr1.12 is absent in DSJ4 (and in 3TCK this
region is smaller) and has three genes, PBPRA2087 (hypothetical protein), PBPRA2084 (putatively evolved beta-Dgalactosidase, alpha subunit) and PBPRA2086 (putative
oxidoreductase), differentially expressed in pressure
experiments.
Region Chr1.13 is absent in both strains and contains a
large gene cluster involved in the tricarboxylic acid fermentation and in the cleavage of citrate to oxaloacetate
and acetate. This region contains six genes up-regulated at
16°C and/or 0.1 MPa (PBPRA2289, PBPRA2292,
PBPRA2295, PBPRA2298, PBPRA2300, PBPRA2303)
(Additional file 3).
Region Chr1.14 is absent in DSJ4 and contains genes
involved in pilus assembly, some of these are up-regulated
at 28 MPa (vs. 0.1 MPa) and down-regulated at 45 MPa
(PBPRA2498, PBPRA2499, PBPRA2505).
Finally, region Chr1.15 is lacking in both of the comparison strains and contains genes having a high expression

mean fluorescence value of 377 arbitrary fluorescence units. As an example, clones localized in the ATP synthase operon have a mean fluorescence
value of 36,100 arbitrary fluorescence units and clones localized in polar flagellum cluster have a mean fluorescence value of 10,200. For region

level at 28 MPa, some of which are differentially expressed
at 28 MPa and 4°C (PBPRA2692, PBPRA2701,
PBPRA2710). This region contains flm genes that in other
bacteria are involved in LPS O-Ag biosynthesis and flagellar filament assembly [19]. Interestingly changes in LPS
O-antigen structure have been observed in Yersinia pestis
KM218 grown at low temperatures [20]. This element has
very low GC content (29%–37%), altered genomic signature and most part of its genes are localized to the left
horn of the graph reported in supporting online material
(Table 1, Figure 3 and Additional file 1), thus supporting
the idea that it could have been laterally acquired.
It is curious that some of the variable regions differentially
expressed in pressure experiments are lacking or are highly
divergent in both 3TCK and DSJ4. This indicates that
although genes located in these regions could be involved
in the high pressure response of SS9, they are not essential
to it and other P. profundum strains will achieve piezophily
with different strategies. Moreover, genes differentially
expressed at 28 MPa or 45 MPa, but present in both DSJ4
and 3TCK, could be beneficial but not sufficient for high
pressure adaptation.
Considering only pressure regulated genes belonging to
the group absent in 3TCK and/or DSJ4, 29 genes are
absent in both strains but only 9 genes are absent in 3TCK
strain alone (Additional file 3 and Additional file 4).
These data were obtained using a profile search with JExpress software [21]. Of these 9 genes, 6 are up-regulated at
28 MPa (vs. 0.1 MPa) and/or 45 MPa (PBPRB0026 hypothetical sensor protein TorS; PBPRA0776 hypothetical
protein; PBPRA1912 hypothetical protein; PBPRA2251
hypothetical ABC transporter, periplasmic solute-binding
protein, family 5; PBPRA2252 hypothetical ABC transporter, permease protein; PBPRA2573 putative long-chain
fatty acid transport protein).
In the SS9 genome we found two genes for TorS proteins
(PBPRA1232 and PBPRB0026). Only one of these
(named PBPRB0026) is differentially expressed at 28 MPa
and this gene is also absent in 3TCK strain. TorS is able to
regulate various genes in response to trimethylamine Noxide (TMAO) [22], in particular it regulates TMAO
reductase (PBPRA1467) that is also up-regulated at 28
MPa. It is conceivable that trimethylamine reduction
increases the pH of the cytoplasm and, for this reason,
other genes identified with microarray experiments, such
as tryptophanase (PBPRB0382 and PBPRA2532) increase
their expression in order to counter this alcalinization.
Alternatively, since no TMAO was added to the SS9 cultures used for the microarray experiments, the second
TorS could also be responding to an as yet undiscovered
signal.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/122

In addition to these six genes, others could perform an
important role in high pressure adaptation. We expect
that a high number of genes and proteins are regulated at
the post-transcriptional level and have an important role
in high pressure adaptation but these studies are beyond
the scope of this paper. Moreover protein structural adaptations, that were not considered in this analysis, could
also have great importance for SS9 piezophily.
Transcriptome analysis of P. profundum strain SS9 under
different pressure and temperature conditions
In a previous paper a preliminary analysis was presented
for genes differentially expressed at 28 MPa (the optimum
growth pressure for SS9) versus 0.1 MPa, highlighting a
stress response at low pressure, an heavy involvement of
membrane transporters in pressure adaptation and an
increased expression at 28 MPa of genes involved in the
Stickland reaction and TMAO reduction. Nevertheless,
additional transcriptional responses remain to be elucidated including the response to low temperatures and the
effect of supraoptimal pressures (45 MPa) on SS9. To better elucidate these points expression profiling was performed at different temperatures (4°C vs. 16°C) and
different pressures (28 MPa vs. 45 MPa). To clarify the role
of specific biological processes on temperature and pressure adaptation, we also performed a Gene Ontology
analysis [23] on differentially expressed genes using specific software such as GoMiner [24] and FatiGO [25].
Analysis of co-regulated genes in pressure and
temperature experiments
The rationale for temperature experiments was the comprehension of which genes are co-regulated during pressure and temperature changes. It is known that low
temperature and high pressure have similar effects on
some biological structures (for example membranes) [5].
We found 36 (43 considering also those that are co-regulated between 45 MPa and temperature) out of 319 genes
that share a similar expression pattern between temperature (16°C vs. 4°C) and pressure (0.1 MPa vs. 28 MPa)
experiments, a number higher that expected only by
chance. In fact, the number of up-regulated genes at 28
MPa and at 4°C is respectively 101 and 75 over 4752 (the
total number of genes covered by our array). If the two
conditions are independent, the expected number of
genes that are up-regulated both at high pressure and low
temperature could be estimated as (101/4752)*(75/
4752)*4752 = 1.6. Similarly we could estimate the
number of down-regulated genes at 28 MPa and 4°C as
(108/4752)*(85/4752)*4752 = 1.9. So the total number
of genes expected to be up- or down-regulated in both the
conditions considered (3.5) is approximately 1/10th of
the differentially expressed genes observed. Therefore
microarray experiments corroborate the hypothesis that

Page 7 of 15

high pressure and low temperature have a overlapping
effects on gene expression.
The SS9 genome sequence reveals the presence of two iron
transporters: one (PBPRB0373-PBPRB0375) that is upregulated at 28 MPa (vs. 0.1 MPa) and at 4°C, while the
other one (PBPRA3182, PBPRA3183, PBPRA3184) is upregulated at 0.1 MPa (vs. 0.1 MPa) and at 16°C. Iron accumulation in organisms that live in the ocean environment
is difficult [26] and the evolution of two alternative transporters could be important in order to survive under different physical conditions.
The presence of different isoforms of the same transporter
that work at different pressure and temperature conditions is not limited to iron transporters. ORFs
PBPRA0098-PBPRA0101 code for a hypothetical oligopeptide transporter and are up-regulated at 0.1 MPa,
while ORFs PBPRA2251-PBPRA2254 code for a different
oligopeptide transporter that is up-regulated at 28 MPa
(vs. 0.1 MPa) and 45 MPa (vs. 28 MPa). Other oligopeptide transporters seem to have the same behaviour such as
those codified by PBPRA0521-PBPRA0525 and
PBPRA2934-PBPR2938, the first being up-regulated at 28
MPa (vs. 0.1 MPa) and 4°C, while the second is weakly
up-regulated at 0.1 MPa.
There is an entire region (Table 1; region Chr1.13) containing a large number of genes that are up-regulated both
at 0.1 MPa and at 16°C. This region was also identified in
the above genome comparisons because it is absent in
both 3TCK and DSJ4 strains.
Analysis of co-regulated genes in 28 MPa and 45 MPa
experiments
The expression profile of SS9 at 28 MPa (the optimal
growth pressure) was also compared with that at 45 MPa.

Interestingly the 45 MPa vs. 28 MPa expression profile
comparison revealed only 68 differentially expressed
genes (33 up-regulated and 35 down-regulated), in contrast to the high number of differentially expressed genes
between 28 MPa and 0.1 MPa (101 up-regulated and 108
down-regulated). Of these 68 differentially expressed
genes, only 31 were specific for very high pressure adaptation, the remaining 37 also being expressed under other
environmental conditions tested. This result indicates that
SS9 undergoes a heavy reorganization in gene expression
between atmospheric pressure and 28 MPa, while this is
not seen moving from 28 MPa to 45 MPa.
A Gene Ontology search with GoMiner software [24] indicated that among the 31 genes specific for very high pressure adaptation there is an enrichment of genes involved
in arginine metabolism (GO: 0006525), catabolism (GO:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/122

0006527) (Additional file 5) and transport (PBPRA2073PBPRA2076). Experiments at 45 MPa were also useful in
identifying genes whose expression follows the direction
of pressure variation, being up-regulated or down-regulated both at 28 MPa (compared to 0.1 MPa) and at 45
MPa (compared to 28 MPa). Twenty one genes matched
this expression profile (Additional file 3).
One of these genes encodes a putative delta-9 fatty acid
desaturase (PBPRB0742). High pressure increases the
rigidity of membranes [27,28], and for this reason genes
such as the putative delta-9 fatty acid desaturase presumably were up-regulated in order to increase the membrane
unsaturation and thus membrane fluidity. Despite the fact
that much is known about membrane modification in
response to pressure variation in SS9 [29,30], these experiments reveal the possible involvement of a previously
unrecognized gene in fatty acid unsaturation. This is particularly noteworthy because fatty acid unsaturation is
critical to high pressure growth of SS9.
A search performed using GoMiner software [24] on differentially expressed genes obtained in the 28 MPa vs. 0.1
MPa experiments and in the 28 MPa vs. 45 MPa experiments indicated that transport is one of the main biological processes involved (Additional file 5). Similar result
was obtained using FatiGO software [25] (data not
shown).
Moreover six of the ORFs that are up-regulated both at 28
MPa (vs. 0.1 MPa) and 45 MPa (vs. 28 MPa) are involved
in transport processes (GO:0006810) (PBPRB1789,
PBPRB1788, PBPRA2251, PBPRA1366, PBPRA0555,
PBPRA1297). As described in the previously published 28
MPa versus 0.1 MPa experiments [4], transport is strongly
influenced by pressure, probably due to the effect of pressure on membrane modification and because of the pressure influence on the activation volume ∆V# (the
difference between the transition state volume and the
initial volume in the system at equilibrium) of the transport process.

Discussion
In the microbial world genetic material can be transferred
between species by several mechanisms involving conjugative plasmids, phages, phage-like elements or transposable elements [31]. These elements allow exchange
among bacteria of a flexible gene pool encoding additional functions that usually are not essential for bacterial
growth, but which provide advantages under particular
conditions. Despite the strong pressure on bacteria to
maintain a small genome size by deleting the more
expendable sequences from their genomes, advantages
provided by some regions allow the maintenance of a flexible gene pool [32,33]. Recently [34] it was demonstrated

Page 8 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:122

that in the case of Xylella fastidiosa a large part of its flexible
gene pool seems to be important in order to explain the
broad host range of this phytopatogen. This despite the
lack of expression of these genes under the culture conditions examined. Using clones selected from the SS9
genome sequencing project and from a specific genomic
library with short inserts, a microarray covering large part
of the SS9 genomic sequence (78.0% on chr1, 69.7% on
chr2 and 79.3% on plasmid) was prepared and used to
identify variable regions in three P. profundum strains. The
lower coverage of chr2 was due to the higher frequency of
repeated regions present on this chromosome, identified
using Phred/Phrap software during finishing step. Clones
were selected which lacked these regions in order to avoid
cross hybridization.
This type of analysis has previously been applied to other
bacterial species [34-37] but this is the first report regarding a microbial species containing members adapted to a
high pressure environment. In fact, using genomic DNA
derived from deep-sea (SS9 and DSJ4) and coastal (3TCK)
isolates we were able to identify 28 regions that are absent
or highly divergent in DSJ4 and 3TCK strains plus a large
number of small regions scattered over the entire SS9
genome.
In silico analysis performed on the SS9 genome sequence
reveals that some of these regions (for example Chr1.15,
Chr2.5, Chr2.7-PI) show differences in GC content,
codon usage and genomic signature (see also Table 1).
There are also regions, such as Chr1 1634244–1651614
bp (containing the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid
synthase, pfa, operon), that appear as alien DNA from
these analyses, but which are present in all three strains
analyzed. While pfa mutants are not pressure-sensitive in
laboratory culture [29], it is likely that the pfa operon is
involved in high pressure adaptation under some deepsea conditions because omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty
acids (PUFAs) do increase in abundance in SS9 membranes with increasing pressure [29,30] and because such
fatty acids are known to modify membrane fluidity in
response to hydrostatic pressure and temperature.
These results indicate that bioinformatics and genomic
microarray analysis can be merged in order to obtain a
more comprehensive picture of the flexible gene pool in
bacteria. Moreover, some of the variable regions identified
by microarray analysis but not by bioinformatic analysis
could derive from genomic reduction and not from lateral
gene transfer.
On the other hand, when the two separate analyses are in
accordance with each other, lateral gene transfer is the
most plausible explanation. This is the case for the 80 kbp
plasmid. However, the adaptive value of this plasmid to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/122

SS9 remains a mystery. It contains no obvious essential
genes and can be lost during laboratory cultivation without a detectable phenotypic change.
A region that is particularly interesting is Chr1.1-LF, consisting mainly of a gene cluster present in SS9 and DSJ4
strains and coding for a second flagellar motility system.
It is known that bacterial motility in the sea is a commonly expressed phenotype [38]. This character is important in enhancing bacteria-organic-matter coupling.
Moreover, high speed swimming in bacteria may reduce
the ability of protozoa to graze on them [39]. Some bacteria, such as Vibrio parahaemolyticus, posses dual flagellar
systems that operate under different circumstances: a
polar flagellum allows motility in liquid environments
(i.e. swimming), while multiple lateral flagella allow
translocation over surfaces or in viscous media [40,18].
The role of the second motility system in SS9 and DSJ4
motility is currently being investigated.
The three genomic islands Chr1.8, Chr2.3 and Chr2.5 are
likely to be prophages in the P. profundum SS9 genome. It
has been suggested that prophages might carry genes beneficial for survival of the host in a selective environment
[41]. In this respect the presence, in these regions, of metabolic genes such as NAD(P)H oxidoreductase
(PBPRB0548), a putative TrkA family protein (glutathione-regulated potassium efflux system protein)
(PBPRB0550) and tryptophanase (PBPRA1344) might be
meaningful. The latter gene has two other paralogues in
the SS9 genome one of which (PBPRA2532) is pressure
regulated suggesting some role in deep-sea adaptation.
Recently [4] we have shown that when moving from 28
MPa to 0.1 MPa, SS9 undergoes various modifications in
metabolic processes. At 28 MPa up-regulation of genes
involved in the Stickland reaction (an amino acid fermentation process typical of anaerobic bacteria such as
Clostridiales and Spirochetales) and of TMAO reduction
occurs.
Another interesting metabolic modification involves
genes of the citrate fermentation pathway located on
region Chr1.13. In Leuconostoc paramesenteroides the citMCDEFGRP operon, involved in citrate utilization, is
located on a plasmid [42]. In SS9 these genes are downregulated both at 28 MPa and at 4°C, moreover this
region is absent both in DSJ4 and 3TCK genomes. The reason for the altered expression of this pathway in SS9 is not
clear but pressure could favour some metabolic processes
only on the basis of chemical-physical parameters. Some
of these genes are absent in 3TCK and DSJ4 and this could
reduce the growth rate of these strains at high pressure. In
fact reactions accompanied by large volume variation are
greatly influenced by pressure, but even if the value of ∆V

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:122

(the difference between the final and initial volume in
entire system at equilibrium, reaction volume) or ∆V#
(apparent volume change of activation or activation volume) is known, it is still difficult to predict how elevated
pressure will affect metabolic pathways in living organisms [43].
As previously reported [4], low pressure induces various
stress responses reflected by the up-regulation of chaperones
(PBPRA0698,
PBPRA1023,
PBPRA1484,
PBPRA3387) and DNA repair enzymes (PBPRA3513,
PBPRB0986, PBPRA0694). This stress response is not
present at 45 MPa despite being supraoptimal for SS9
growth. Perhaps low pressure affects protein folding
because these SS9 proteins are adapted to high pressure
and this effect is not evident in high pressure experiments
(at least up to 45 MPa). Another curious result stemming
from the 45 MPa transcriptome experiment is the apparent reduction in arginine biosynthesis and transport at
high pressure relative to that at 28 MPa. It could be that
this large amino acid is selected against within much of
the protein pool present at this high pressure, in contrast
to the thermophilic and piezophilic Archaea Pyrococcus
abyssi which has a higher arginine content in its proteins
respect to the non-piezophilic bacterium Pyrococcus furiosus [44]. Alternatively, other genes could govern arginine
utilization at high pressure.
Transport seems to be the cellular process most influenced
by pressure, at least considering the number of regulated
genes belonging to this category. This influence could be
due to volume changes associated with the transport process [45]. Also temperature variation influences the transport process, which could be due to alterations of
transporters efficiency induced by membrane fluidity
modifications. It is interesting to note that some transporters are present in two or more copies in the SS9
genome and therefore could work at specific pressures
and temperatures.
Likewise, SS9 may choose among different metabolic
processes (amino acid reduction, TMAO reduction, citrate
fermentation pathway, etc.) as a function of pressure in
order to optimize energy gain. Other mechanisms previously described [4], such as the influence of pressure on
enzymes involved in complex polysaccharides utilization
(PBPRA0480, PBPRA2198, PBPRB1016), support this
hypothesis. The ability of SS9 to choose between different
transporters or metabolic strategies could also be related
to the fact that SS9 is not an obligate and narrow spectrum
piezophile, but is able to grow over a large range of
pressures.

Conclusion
Our findings on genome organization and transcriptional
activity of different P. profundum strains depict a high level
of genetic diversity, where variable regions influence
extremely important processes such as motility and energy
production. But, due to the complexity of deep-sea environment, characterized by a peculiar combination of
chemical-physical parameters and nutrient resources, it is
difficult to assign a role to all the variable regions present
only in the pressure adapted strains.
Expression studies on P. profundum SS9 performed at different pressure and temperature conditions reveal a complex adaptation network involving a great number of
membrane transporters, metabolic processes, and amino
acid biosynthesis and membrane modification enzymes.
Some of these genes are located on variable regions.
The pressure-regulated genes unique to piezophilic P. profundum strains are likely to be fruitful targets of future
genetic investigations into genes which facilitate growth
and survival under deep-sea conditions.

Methods
Origin of the isolates and growth conditions
Photobacterium profundum SS9 and Photobacterium profundum DSJ4 have been previously described [2,3]. Photobacterium profundum strain 3TCK was isolated by the
University of California San Diego Environmental Microbiology Laboratory class during a cruise on board the RV
Robert Gordon Sproul on April 17, 1999. It was obtained
from a superficial sediment sample within San Diego Bay
following dilution plating onto a modified K Medium
[46] and incubation at 23°C for several weeks. One of the
resulting colonies subsequently analyzed by 16S rRNA
sequence analysis was determined to be a new strain of P.
profundum. The 3TCK 16S rDNA was amplified and
sequenced using general eubacterial primers [47] on a
MegaBACE 1000 automated sequencer (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) according to manufacturer's
instructions.

Maintaining bacterial cultures in balanced growth at high
pressure, when the cultures are separated from the investigator by ~2 cm of stainless steel, is extremely challenging. Because of these constraints it was not possible for us
to serially culture cells under anaerobic, high pressure
conditions (at least not without regularly shocking cultures with decompression for several minutes), and thus
only one round of culturing was used. Overnight log
phase atmospheric pressure cultures of P. profundum SS9
cells were grown in Difco Marine 2216 Broth supplemented with 20 mM glucose and 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5.
These cells were diluted 250-fold into the same medium,
transferred to polyethylene bulbs, sealed with no air space

and placed inside pressure vessels. Cultures were then
rocked gently back and forth in a large refrigerated water
bath shaker at either atmospheric pressure, at 28 MPa or
at 45 MPa. Pressure was applied using a hand operated
Haskel pump and a quick fit connector to the pressure
vessel. With this system pressurization requires approximately 1 min and decompression ~1 second.

SS9PLAS3F (TCAGTGCATCGCTAGGGTTAGACT-3'),

Under these culture conditions the cells quickly used up
most of the available dissolved oxygen, as reflected by
resazurin dye reduction analyses. After about 20–30 hours
the cultures were harvested. In all cases cells were
obtained from early log phase cultures (optical density at
A600 nm of 0.1–0.21). The cells were immediately pelleted and RNA was immediately extracted and stored in
75% ethanol at -80°C.

DNA microarray preparation
Most of the microarray clones (2174) identifying a single
ORF were selected from a small-insert genomic library,
representing 1264 individual ORFs. In order to obtain a
general overview of the SS9 genome we selected also 2227
non overlapping clones from a large-insert library, representing other 3488 ORFs. Clones were selected from 384
well plates using Biomek 2000 workstation and were
inoculated in 96 well plates with 100 µl of LB/Ampicillin
(50 µg/ml). Clones were grown overnight and then 1 µl
was used for PCR amplification in 96 well plates. PCR
amplification mix (one sample volume) (H2O mQ AF
47.616 µl; buffer 10 × 6 µl; MgCl2 25 mM 3.6 µl; dNTPs
10 mM 1.32 µl; primer -21M13 100 µM 1.32 µl; primer
M13REV 100 µM 1.32 µl; Taq polimerase 0.2 µl; total volume 59 µl). The PCR cycle for amplification was 96°C for
5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 96°C for 25 s, 56°C for 30
s, 72°C for 2 min and a final extension step at 72°C for
10 min.

For genomic experiments approximately 1 liter of bacterial cells was harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at
5,000 × g and the pellet was resuspended in 5 ml buffer A
(50 mM Tris, 50 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). The suspension was
incubated overnight at -20°C. Then 500 µl of buffer B
(250 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mg/ml lysozime) were added to
the frozen suspension, which was thawed at room temperature and subsequently incubated on ice for 45 min. At
this point 1 ml of buffer C (0.5% SDS, 50 mM Tris, 400
mM EDTA, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml Proteinase K) was added and
the suspension was incubated at 50°C for 60 min. Additional 750 µl of buffer C were added followed by another
30 min incubation at 50°C. The genomic DNA was
extracted twice with 5 ml. of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl
alcohol (24:24:1), and precipitated with 0.8 volumes of
isopropanol. The DNA pellet was recovered by spooling
on a glass rod, and rehydrated in 4 ml of buffer D (50 mM
Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 200 µg/ml RNAse A, pH 8.0) and incubated overnight at 4°C. The solution was extracted once
with an equal volume of chloroform, then precipitated
with 0.8 volumes of isopropanol. The DNA pellet was
recovered by centrifugation, washed once with 70% ethanol and stored dry at -20°C.
For growth curves, the strains (SS9, DSJ4, 3TCK) were
grown at 9°C in polyethylene bulbs at different pressures
(0.1, 15, 30, 45 and 75 MPa). At time intervals, one bulb
was removed and its optical density at 600 nm was
recorded. The growth rate was calculated from the logportion of the curve obtained.
Detection of the 80 kb plasmid in the different P. profundum strains was done using primers
SS9PLAS1F (5'-ACAAGAGGCAGCAAAAAGACTAAC-3'),
SS9PLAS2R (5'-TGCCGCACAGGTAATGATAGGATG-3'),

SS9PLAS4R (AAAGCATTATGAAAAATTGGTAGA).
The PCR cycle for amplification was 94°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 52°C for 30 s, 72°C
for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°C for 7 min.

PCR products were purified using ethanol precipitation.
PCR reactions were transferred to 96-well U-bottom tissue
culture plates (Costar #3790) and 1/10 vol. 3 M sodium
acetate (pH 5.2) and 2.5 volumes ethanol were added to
the PCR. Plates were mixed by inversion and stored at 20°C overnight. Plates were centrifuged in Sorvall RC-3B
at 3500 rpm for 1 h (RCF = 3565 g) and supernatant was
poured off from plates. PCR products were washed with
100 µl of ice-cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged again for
30 min. Pellets were dried in speed-vac for 10 min. Before
use, PCR products were resuspended in 15 µl 3 × SSC
overnight using Titramax 101 plate shaker (Heidolph).
For expression microarray experiments amplicons were
arrayed onto MICROMAX™ Glass Slides (PerkinElmer Life
Sciences, Inc.) using "MicroGrid II" spotter (Biorobotics,
Genomic Solutions®) equipped with 16 pins. Microarrays
have a spotted area of 18 mm × 18 mm and are composed
by 16 subarrays (4 metacolumns and 4 metarows) containing three replicates of each spot. Spots have a diameter
of approximately 80 µm and were spaced 150 µm. For
genomic microarray experiments amplicons were arrayed
onto MICROMAX™ Glass Slides (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc.) using "GenPack Array21" spotter equipped
with 32 pins. Microarrays have a spotted area of 36 mm ×
18 mm, are composed by 32 subarrays (4 metacolumns
and 8 metarows) containing two replicates of each spot.

Nucleic acid labeling and hybridization conditions
Expression experiments
For microarray analysis at different pressure, bacterial cultures were grown as explained above at two different conditions (0.1 MPa/16°C and 45 MPa/16°C) and were
queried against a common reference culture (28 MPa/
16°C). For temperature microarray experiments bacterial
cultures were grown at 0.1 MPa/4°C and were queried
against a culture grown at 0.1 MPa/16°C. For each growth
condition total RNA was extracted from three independent cultures using trizol (Gibco) and RNeasy columns
(Qiagen). Genomic DNA was removed using DNAsi
(Ambion). For microarray expression experiments 2 µl of
random hexamer primers (3 mg/ml) were added to 20 µg
of total RNA, volume was brought to 18.5 µl with RNasefree water and were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 using an
aminoallyl indirect labeling method according to the
TIGR protocols with some minor modifications [48].
Solution was mixed well and incubated at 70°C for 10
min. After denaturation RNA was snap-freezed in dry ice/
ethanol bath for 30 s, then it was centrifuged briefly at
10,000 rpm and maintained at room temperature. 6 µl of
5 × First Strand buffer, 3 µl of 0.1 M DTT, 0.6 µl of 10 mM
dATP, dCTP and dGTP, 0.9 µl 10 mM dTTP, 0.6 µl 10 mM
dUTP-AA, and 2 µl of SuperScript II RT (200U/ µl) (Invitrogen) were added to the solution that was mixed gently
and incubated at 42°C for 3 h. To hydrolyze RNA 3 µl of
NaOH 1 M and 0.6 µl of 500 mM EDTA were added to the
mixture that was incubated at 65°C for 15 min in a water
bath. 3 µl of 1 M HCl and 8.5 µl of 2 M HEPES (SIGMA)
was added in order to neutralize pH. Removal of unincorporated aa-dUTP and free amines was made using Microcon YM-30 Cleanup method (Millipore). Sample volume
was reduced to 9 µl in a speed vac and 1/10th volume of
carbonate buffer (Na2CO3 1 M, pH 9) was added to the
cDNA and this solution was used to resuspend the CyNHS-ester dye. Reaction was incubated for 1 h in the dark
at room temperature. Labelled cDNA was purified using
the GenEluteTM PCR Clean-up kit (SIGMA). Analysis of
labelled cDNA was made using a 50 µl quartz MicroCuvette (Beckman) to analyze the entire undiluted sample in
a spectrophotometer. After analysis the two differentially
labeled probes (Cy3 vs. Cy5) were combined and precipitated with NH4Ac and ethanol according to standard protocols. DNA was recovered by centrifugation, and the
pellet was washed twice with 70% EtOH. The pellet was
briefly air dried, then resuspended in hybridization buffer
containing 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 100 ng/
µl SS-DNA, 5 × Denhardt's solution. Labeled DNA was
heated to 95°C for 2 min and chilled on ice before use in
hybridization. Hybridization was performed over night in
hybridization chamber (GeneMachines) at 42°C using

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/122

coverslip. After hybridization microarrays were washed
two times for 5 min with 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS pre-heated at
42°C, two times for 5 min with 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at
room temperature, two times for 5 min with 0.2 × SSC at
room temperature and finally two times for 5 min with
SSC0.1 × at room temperature.
Genomic experiments
For a 50 µl reaction, 10 µg of genomic DNA (gDNA) was
combined with 4 µg of random hexamer primers and
heated to 95°C for 5 min. After denaturation gDNA was
snap-freezed in dry ice/ethanol bath for 30 s, was
centrifuged briefly at 10,000 rpm and mantained at room
temperature. 1.5 µl of 10 mM dATP, dCTP and dGTP, 0.9
µl 10 mM dTTP, 0.6 µl 10 mM dUTP-AA, 3 µl of Eco Pol
buffer and 15 U of the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli
polymerase (NEB) were added to the reaction. The reaction was placed at 37°C for 2 h. Labeled DNA was then
purified and labeled as described in the previous section.
After precipitation DNA was recovered by centrifugation,
and the pellet was washed with 70% EtOH and re-centrifuged.

Hybridization and post-hybridization washes were performed as described in the previous section "expression
experiments".
Image acquisition and analysis
Arrays were scanned with a ScanArray® Lite scanner (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc.). Hybridization signals were
quantified using QuantArray software (PerkinElmer Life
Sciences, Inc.). Data representing weak signals (median
pixel intensity lower than 400 in both channels) were
removed. Signal intensities were normalized using MIDAS
V2.15 [49] and used to generate relative hybridization
ratios (query/reference).
Expression experiments
normalization was performed using loc fit normalization
(LOWESS) normalizing each single microarray block separately. The ratios from a maximum of nine data points
(triplicate spots, hybridizations performed in triplicate)
were analyzed with SAM software [50]. When less than six
over nine data points existed, the clone was treated as data
missing and was excluded from SAM analysis. Only clones
having log2 ratio higher than 0.7 or lower than -0.7 and
having d (the T-statistic value) higher than +2.3 or lower
than -2.3 were considered. Differentially expressed clones
spanning a single ORF were used for the identification of
differentially expressed genes and the other clones were
used in order to confirm or reject data obtained. All the
fluorescence intensity data were used after normalization
for the analysis of absolute gene expression on the two
chromosomes.

Genomic experiments
analysis was performed as described for expression analysis but only clones having log2 ratio higher than 1 or lower
than -1 and having d (the T-statistic value) higher than
+2.7 or lower than -2.7 were considered.
GC content, codon bias and genomic signature analysis of
SS9 genome
GC content reported in Figure 2 is calculated as the G+C
frequency considering 5 kb windows with 0.1 kb shift.

Codon bias and GC frequency in third position (S3%) in
SS9 genes longer than 200 codons was calculated using a
home-made perl script based on formula described in [9].
Genomic signature was calculated as described by Karlin
S. [7] considering tetranucleotide frequency calculated as
the odds ratio ρXYZK = fXYZK/fXfYfZfK where fXYZK is the frequency of the tetranucleotide XYZK in the sequence under
study. For double-stranded DNA sequences, symmetrized
version ρ*XYZK is computed from frequencies of the
sequence concatenated with its inverted complementary
sequence. ρ*XYZK was calculated for the whole genome
(c*XYZK) and for 5 kb windows (r*XYZK) (with a 0.5 kb
step). The delta distance, calculated as δ* = 1/256 Σ
|r*XYZK-c*XYZK|, was plotted in Figure 2 (10th circle).

Additional File 1
Codon bias relative to average gene versus third position GC content in
eight variable regions of the Photobacterium profundum SS9 genome.
In these graphs are represented only ORFs longer than 200 codons. Eight
variable regions of the SS9 genome are considered, one for each graph. In
red are highlighted ORFs located in regions that were found absent in
3TCK/DSJ4 genomes using comparative genomic hybridization experiments. A large number of ORFs are positioned in left and right horn of
the graphs, a strong indication that they belong to laterally transferred
regions.

Additional File 4
List of ORFs absent only in 3TCK strain. Data obtained from genomic
comparison experiments between 3TCK (the pressure sensitive strain) and
SS9 strain. In this table are reported ORFs that were found absent only in
3TCK and not in DSJ4 strain. In order to obtain a more reliable result,
clones obtained from SAM analysis of 3TCK strain were filtered considering only those having log2 ratio higher than +1 and d statistic value higher
than +1.8. Using self-written PERL scripts, from the "3TCK clones" set,
were subtracted the clones that were found absent also in DSJ4. In DSJ4
strain we used less stringent criteria and we considered all clones having
log2 ratio higher than 0.5. Clones absent both in 3TCK and DSJ4 were
discarded. Clones absent only in 3TCK were associated with ORFs position and the list of ORFs obtained were manually verified. Table columns
show: (1) the locus name, (2) the ORF description, (3) the TrEMBL
code, (4) the microarray clone/s overlapped to the ORFs, (5) the log2 ratio
obtain from comparison with SS9 genome (reference), (6) the "d" statistic value obtained from SAM analysis and (7) the result obtained in
microarray expression experiments. In the first column large groups of
ORFs that are adjacent in the SS9 genome are highlighted using bold
character.
