Horizontal part ofand comparative genomic analysis ancestor into an ancestor of AspergillusACE1 cluster reveals evidence for horizontal

Abstract
Background: Filamentous fungi synthesize many secondary metabolites and are rich in genes
encoding proteins involved in their biosynthesis. Genes from the same pathway are often clustered
and co-expressed in particular conditions. Such secondary metabolism gene clusters evolve rapidly
through multiple rearrangements, duplications and losses. It has long been suspected that clusters
can be transferred horizontally between species, but few concrete examples have been described
so far.
Results: In the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea, the avirulence gene ACE1 that codes for a
hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS) belongs to a cluster of
15 genes involved in secondary metabolism. Additional related clusters were detected in the
ascomycetes Chaetomium globosum, Stagonospora nodorum and Aspergillus clavatus. Gene-by-gene
phylogenetic analysis showed that in C. globosum and M. grisea, the evolution of these ACE1-like
clusters is characterized by successive complex duplication events including tandem duplication
within the M. grisea cluster. The phylogenetic trees also present evidence that at least five of the
six genes in the homologous ACE1 gene cluster in A. clavatus originated by horizontal transfer from
a donor closely related to M. grisea.
Conclusion: The ACE1 cluster originally identified in M. grisea is shared by only few fungal species.
Its sporadic distribution within euascomycetes is mainly explained by multiple events of duplication
and losses. However, because A. clavatus contains an ACE1 cluster of only six genes, we propose
that horizontal transfer from a relative of M. grisea into an ancestor of A. clavatus provides a much
simpler explanation of the observed data than the alternative of multiple events of duplication and
losses of parts of the cluster.

Background

In filamentous fungi, genes involved in the same secondary
metabolite biosynthetic pathway are often located at the same
locus in the genome and co-expressed, defining gene clusters
[1]. Genomic clustering of genes with related cellular functions (but unrelated sequences) also occurs in other eukaryotes including mammals, nematodes and plants [2-4]. In
mammals, it has been shown that clusters of co-expressed
genes tend not to be rearranged among species, which indicates that natural selection can act to conserve gene order
[5,6]. Similarly in fungi, natural selection seems to act to conserve gene clusters as exemplified in Aspergillus species by
the cluster for the biosynthesis of aflatoxin and sterigmatocystin that has been maintained as a cluster, despite many
internal rearrangements, for at least 120 million years [7,8].
The evolutionary mechanisms by which these clusters are created and maintained are unclear, but there is evidence that
some instances of clustering result from strong natural selection. For example, the DAL cluster involved in nitrogen
metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was formed relatively recently by a series of near-simultaneous relocations of
genes that were previously scattered around the genome [9].
Other mechanisms involved in the formation and maintenance of clusters include selection for co-regulation by chromatin remodelling, epistatic selection for tight linkage
between genetically interacting genes, and the "selfish
operon" hypothesis of origin by horizontal gene transfer
(HGT) [2,10-13]. Indeed, the clustering of the genes from a
pathway at a single locus certainly facilitates HGT of genes
involved in the same cellular function [10,14], increasing its
likelihood.
Despite frequent speculation (reviewed in [15]), and even
though some clear examples of HGT of single genes between
fungal species [16] or from bacteria to fungi [17] are known,
there are few reports that conclusively demonstrate HGT of a
fungal secondary metabolite cluster. The strongest candidate
reported so far is the epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) synthase gene cluster, recently analyzed by Patron et al [18], but
even in this instance alternative evolutionary scenarios can be
contemplated (see Discussion). One of the best-known cases
of possible HGT of a fungal secondary metabolite cluster concerns the fungal β-lactam (penicillin) antibiotic biosynthetic
genes of Penicillium species. This proposal was originally
made when bacterial and fungal isopenicillin-N-synthetases
were found to have unexpectedly highly similar protein
sequences [19-21]. However, subsequent phylogenetic analyses of these proteins failed to provide robust support for their
HGT [22,23].
The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea is one of the richest known fungi in terms of secondary metabolite gene clusters [24,25]. One of them contains the avirulence gene ACE1
that encodes a hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal
peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS) likely involved in the biosynthesis of an avirulence signal recognized by rice cultivars car-

rying the resistance gene Pi33 [26]. The ACE1 cluster contains
15 genes that are co-expressed specifically during the appressorium mediated penetration of the fungus into host tissues
(Collemare et al, unpublished results). During annotation of
the ACE1 cluster, a similar cluster was identified in the related
animal pathogen Chaetomium globosum. We were then
interested in identifying possible homologous clusters in
other fungi in order to decipher its evolutionary history. In
the present study, we combine phylogenetics and comparative genomics to identify orthologs of the M. grisea ACE1
cluster in other ascomycetes. We define a set of three genes
that are shared across all instances of the cluster and hence
are probably ancestral to it. This analysis revealed that the
cluster in M. grisea expanded by internal duplication, and
that after this duplication, part of the ACE1 cluster was likely
horizontally transferred from an M. grisea-like ancestor into
an ancestor of Aspergillus clavatus.

Results
Identification of homologous ACE1 clusters in other
filamentous fungi
The ACE1 secondary metabolism gene cluster of M. grisea
comprises 15 genes: ACE1 and SYN2 are PKS-NRPS hybrid
genes; RAP1 and RAP2 code for enoyl reductases; CYP1-CYP4
for cytochrome P450 monoxygenases; ORFZ for an α/βhydrolase; OXR1 and OXR2 for oxidoreductases; MFS1 codes
for a transporter in the MFS superfamily; BC2 codes for a
binuclear zinc finger transcription factor; OME1 codes for an
O-methyl transferase; and ORF3 has no homology to known
proteins (Collemare et al, unpublished results). To find gene
clusters homologous to the ACE1 cluster in other fungal species, we used an algorithm that searched 26 fungal genomes
for loci where at least three likely orthologs of genes from the
ACE1 cluster were linked (see Materials and methods). This
search identified nine similar clusters in seven fungal species
from the subphylum Pezizomycotina: three Sordariomycetes
(Chaetomium globosum, Fusarium oxysporum and F. verticillioides), one Dothideomycete (Stagonospora nodorum)
and three Eurotiomycetes (Aspergillus clavatus, Coccidioides immitis and Uncinocarpus reesii) (Figure 1).
Two types of clusters related to the ACE1 cluster were identified: large clusters with eight or more genes are found in M.
grisea, C. globosum and S. nodorum, whereas smaller clusters with three to six genes are found in the three Eurotiomycetes and in Fusarium species (Figure 1). C. globosum is
unusual as its genome contains two large ACE1-like clusters,
which we refer to as clusters 1 and 2. Similarly, the A. clavatus
genome has two clusters as discussed below. Interestingly, a
core set of three genes (homologs of ACE1, RAP1 and ORF3;
boxed in Figure 1) is present in all eight species. The presence
of this core suggests that the physical linkage between these
three genes is ancient and can be inferred to have existed in
the common ancestor of all the genomes considered in Figure
1. As well as the genes in the eight clusters shown in Figure 1,

ACE1 and ACE1-like gene clusters in filamentous fungi
Figure 1
ACE1 and ACE1-like gene clusters in filamentous fungi. Colors indicate gene orthology in different species and paralogs in the same species. Horizontal lines
indicate genes that are adjacent in the genome, with gene orientations as shown. Genomic regions are not drawn to scale. Parts A and B of the M. grisea
cluster as identified in the text are marked. The core set of three genes inferred to have been present in the ancestral cluster are boxed. Vertical lines
indicate the closest relatives of genes in the M. grisea cluster and one of the A. clavatus clusters, based on phylogenetic analyses (Figure 2 and Additional
data file 1). The species phylogeny is based on the whole-genome supertree analysis of Fitzpatrick et al [27]; in that study the placement of
Dothideomycetes relative to Sordariomycetes and Eurotiomycetes varied depending on the method of analysis, so we have shown it as a trichotomy. The
analysis of Hane et al of the complete S. nodorum genome placed Dothideomycetes and Sordariomycetes in a clade with Eurotiomycetes outside [47].
Species-specific gene nomenclature is shown, except for M. grisea (Collemare et al, unpublished results). Red, green and blue coloring of species names
corresponds to the labelling of individual genes from the clusters in Figure 2 and Additional data file 1.0.

we also identified a small number of single homologs of genes
from the M. grisea ACE1 cluster that are located at dispersed
genomic locations in other species.

Phylogenetic analysis of the ACE1 cluster in
filamentous fungi
Gene-by-gene phylogenetic analyses were carried out to decipher the evolutionary history of the loci using homologs (even
at dispersed locations) of genes from M. grisea ACE1 cluster
(Figure 2 and Additional data file 1). The first trend evident
from this phylogenetic analysis is that genes from clusters in
Eurotiomycetes and Fusarium spp. are distant from those of
the M. grisea, C. globosum and S. nodorum clusters. Indeed,
genes in clusters from these last three species define clades
supported by high bootstrap values (> 91%), to the exclusion
of genes from Eurotiomycetes and Fusarium species (Figure
2a,b,e,f). Interestingly, genes from one of the two clusters in
A. clavatus are more closely related to genes in the M. grisea

ACE1 cluster than to those in ACE1-like clusters from other
Eurotiomycetes (see below). In view of the gene contents of
the clusters and their phylogenetic relationships, we refer to
the large clusters in M. grisea, C. globosum, S. nodorum and
the larger of the two clusters in A. clavatus as "ACE1 clusters",
and to the smaller clusters in Eurotiomycetes and Fusarium
spp. as "ACE1-like clusters". These two types of cluster have
probably had a long history of independent evolution,
although they certainly share a common ancestor.
We then focused on the origins of the duplicated genes in the
M. grisea cluster. Phylogenetic trees show clearly that in M.
grisea RAP2 is a paralog of RAP1, CYP3 is a paralog of CYP2,
CYP4 is a paralog of CYP1, and SYN2 is a paralog of ACE1
(Figure 2a-d). Notably, in each of these pairs, one gene is
located on the left-hand side of the M. grisea cluster and the
other is on the right-hand side. Thus the M. grisea cluster
appears to have undergone partial tandem duplication at

some stage during its evolution, although the gene order is
not conserved between the two parts. The presence of two
ACE1 clusters in C. globosum is suggestive of a second block-

duplication event in this species. However, for most genes
present in both C. globosum ACE1 clusters, the copy from
cluster 1 forms a clade with their M. grisea homologs. This

close phylogenetic relationship is observed for ACE1, RAP1,
ORFZ, OXR1, CYP1, and OXR2. The only exception to this
pattern is M. grisea ORF3, which is marginally closer to the
C. globosum cluster 2 gene, but with low bootstrap support
(Figure 2 and Additional data file 1). This observation suggests that the duplication that gave rise to the current C. globosum clusters 1 and 2 occurred in a common ancestor of C.
globosum and M. grisea, and that the corresponding cluster
2 in M. grisea was lost.
On the basis of this analysis, we divided the M. grisea cluster
into two parts, A and B, so that each of the duplicated genes
in M. grisea has one copy in part A and one in part B (Figure
1). Part A in M. grisea consists of nine genes, all of which have
orthologs in one or both of the clusters in its closest relative C.
globosum. The clusters in other species consist of homologs
of genes from M. grisea part A, plus one gene from part B
(ORF3; see Discussion). The order of the part A genes is not
conserved among M. grisea, C. globosum and S. nodorum.
Surprisingly, this phylogenetic analysis shows that five of the
six genes from part B of the M. grisea ACE1 cluster group with
genes from the larger of the two clusters in A. clavatus, rather
than with the genes in the more closely related (Sordariomycete) species C. globosum, or with their part A paralogs in M.
grisea. Bootstrap values for grouping the M. grisea part B
genes SYN2, RAP2, CYP4, CYP3 and ORF3 with their A. clavatus homologs are 98-100% (Figure 2a-e). The only gene
from part B of the M. grisea cluster that does not group with
A. clavatus is OME1 (panel e of Additional data file 1), but this
is also the only gene whose detected homolog in A. clavatus
(ACLA_002520) is not physically clustered with the others,
which calls its orthology into question. The consistency of this
phylogenetic result for part B genes, and its disagreement
with the expected species relationships, are indicative of HGT
between A. clavatus and part B of the M. grisea cluster. In
contrast seven of the nine genes from part A of the M. grisea
cluster, including ACE1 itself, lie at the expected phylogenetic
position forming a clade with C. globosum (Figure 2 and
Additional file 1; the two exceptions are CYP2, which is discordant but has a low bootstrap value of 66%, and MFS1,
which cannot be analyzed because there is no homolog in the
C. globosum clusters).
For the four panels in Figure 2 that include sequences from
other Eurotiomycetes (C. immitis and U. reesii) as well as A.
clavatus, we used the likelihood ratio test (LRT) to test
whether the topologies shown (Figure 2a,b,e,f) have significantly higher likelihoods than alternative trees where the
Eurotiomycetes were constrained to form a monophyletic
group. In all four cases the topology shown in Figure 2 is significantly more likely than the tree expected if genes were
inherited vertically (p < 0.001 for each).

Volume 9, Issue 1, Article R18

Khaldi et al. R18.5

Identifying the direction of gene transfer
To determine whether part B of the cluster was transferred
from an M. grisea-like donor to an ancestor of A. clavatus, or
vice versa, we examined phylogenetic trees constructed from
those genes that have orthologs both in species that are close
relatives of M. grisea and in species that are closer to A. clavatus. We would predict that if an ancestor of A. clavatus was
the recipient of HGT, then the genes in its ACE1 cluster would
not show the expected close relationship to other Eurotiomycete species such as C. immitis and U. reesii (Figure 1), and
would instead form a clade with the donor lineage (represented by M. grisea). Conversely, if the direction of transfer
was from an A. clavatus-like donor into the M. grisea lineage,
we would expect the M. grisea part B genes not to form a
monophyletic clade with the other Sordariomycete species C.
globosum, and instead to group with A clavatus.
In the phylogenetic tree of ORF3 sequences, the shared A. clavatus-M. grisea branch lies within a clade that contains
homologs from the two clusters in C. globosum, as well as the
Dothideomycete S. nodorum (Figure 2e). The ORF3
orthologs from C. immitis and U. reesii clearly lie outside this
clade with 95% bootstrap support. Similarly, the phylogenetic
tree of RAP1 and RAP2 orthologs (Figure 2b) shows that the
shared branch containing the A. clavatus gene and the part B
M. grisea gene (RAP2) lies within a larger clade that includes
the C. globosum and M. grisea part A (RAP1) orthologs. The
homologs from C. immitis and U. reesii lie outside (91% bootstrap support). Likewise, the phylogenetic tree of the ACE1SYN2 pair (Figure 2a) places the A. clavatus sequence within
a Sordariomycete/Dothideomycete clade, distant from the
other Eurotiomycetes (C. immitis and U. reesii). These topologies all indicate that an ancestor of M. grisea was the donor
of the transferred part B genes, and an ancestor of A. clavatus
was the recipient.
ORFZ is the only gene in the A. clavatus ACE1 cluster that
does not have a homolog in part B of the M. grisea cluster.
The origin of this gene in A. clavatus is not clear. Phylogenetic
analysis (Figure 2f) indicates that A. clavatus ORFZ does not
group with the C. immitis and U. reesii genes, and this conclusion is supported by the LRT. This result suggests a foreign
origin for A. clavatus ORFZ, but the absence of a homolog in
M. grisea part B makes it impossible to test whether this gene
has a similar origin to its five neighboring genes in A.
clavatus.
We conclude that there is phylogenetic support for the
hypothesis that at least five of the six genes in the ACE1 cluster of A. clavatus originated by HGT, and that the most probable single donor is a Sordariomycete ancestor related to M.
grisea.

Discussion
The ACE1 cluster is specific to few fungal species
A complete ACE1 cluster is present in only four of the 23
sequenced Pezizomycotina genomes (M. grisea, C. globosum,
S. nodorum and A. clavatus). Such a sporadic distribution
could be the result of either independent HGTs or frequent
losses of the whole cluster in different lineages (Figure 3). We
favor the latter explanation because - with the exception of A.
clavatus - our phylogenetic trees of genes from the cluster
have topologies that are in broad agreement with the
expected species phylogeny [27]. We suggest that an ACE1like cluster consisting of at least three genes (homologous to
ACE1, RAP1 and ORF3) existed in the common ancestor of
Pezizomycotina, but this cluster has been lost in many lineages subsequently. The scheme in Figure 3 identifies four
independent lineages (shown by dashed lines) in which all
copies of the cluster have been lost. We cannot tell, with current data, whether genes such as OXR1 that are present in the
ACE1 clusters of Sordariomycetes and Dothideomycetes but
not in the ACE1-like clusters of Eurotiomycetes correspond to
lineage-specific additions or losses.
Any tree showing apparent HGT of a gene can also be
explained by an alternative scenario of gene duplications and
losses. However, the situation reported here is rather different to typical cases of possible HGT of individual genes,
because it involves multiple genes that are arranged as a large
tandem duplication (in M. grisea). The fact that the A. clavatus ACE1 cluster forms a clade with the M. grisea part B genes
(to the exclusion of the part A genes) means that the only
alternative scenario to HGT is one where the part A/part B
tandem duplication occurred right at the base of the tree in
Figure 3. This scenario would then necessitate at least four
events of precise loss of exactly one part of the tandemly
duplicated set of genes: part B in C. globosum, part B in the
ancestor of C. immitis and U. reesii, part B in S. nodorum,
and part A in A. clavatus. Because of the precise nature of the
deletion required (and choice of gene copy to delete), we do
not regard this scenario as likely.
The discontinuous distribution of the ACE1 cluster among
fungal species suggests that evolutionary constraints act to
maintain this cluster only in few species. As M. grisea, S.
nodorum and C. globosum are plant or animal pathogens, it
is tempting to speculate that the ACE1 cluster is involved in
the infection process of these three species. The metabolite
produced by this biosynthetic pathway may be an important
pathogenicity factor, but such a role remains to be determined. A. clavatus is different as it is not pathogenic. The
presence of the ACE1 cluster in A. clavatus may arise from
selection involving an unknown biological role of this metabolite in this fungus. Identifying the molecules made by these
different clusters will be necessary to understand the role of
the ACE1 cluster in fungal biology and could give clues about
evolution of the ancestral biosynthetic pathway controlled by
this cluster.

ACE1 cluster evolution in Sordariomycetes involved
several duplication events
The ACE1 cluster has a complex history with multiple events
of large-scale duplication and multiple losses. The scenario
we infer is summarized in Figure 3. An ancient duplication
produced the large ACE1 and smaller ACE1-like clusters. A
second duplication event in an ancestral Sordariomycete gave
rise to the two clusters (1 and 2) presently seen in C. globosum. This event occurred prior to the speciation between C.
globosum and M. grisea, but M. grisea later lost its counterpart of cluster 2. Independently, cluster 1 underwent a tandem duplication event, generating parts A and B. This tandem
duplication survived in M. grisea, but in C. globosum the
addition (part B of cluster 1) was lost again. It might seem
simpler to suggest that the part A/B tandem duplication was
an event that occurred specifically in M. grisea after it
diverged from C. globosum, but we know that this is incorrect
because the part B genes from M. grisea form outgroups to a
clade consisting of C. globosum and M. grisea part A genes.
We can also be sure that the surviving duplications seen in M.
grisea and C. globosum were separate events because of the
topology of the phylogenetic trees: if the surviving genes were
descended from the same duplication event we would expect
that in the ACE1-SYN2 tree, for example, M. grisea ACE1 and
SYN2 should each form a separate monophyletic group with
one of the C. globosum genes, but that is not seen (Figure 2a).
Instead we interpret the trees as indicative of two duplications of the whole cluster in a Sordariomycete ancestor of M.
grisea and C. globosum, the first of which was non-tandem
and the second of which was tandem. After this tandem duplication, the M. grisea lineage lost its ortholog of cluster 2 of C.
globosum, and the C. globosum lineage lost its ortholog of
part B of M. grisea (Figure 3). This pattern of frequent loss is
consistent with the cluster's sporadic distribution in fungi.
ORF3 is unusual as it is inferred to have been present in the
ancestor of all ACE1 and ACE1-like clusters, but in M. grisea
it is not duplicated and it shows phylogenetic affinity to A.
clavatus rather than to C. globosum or S. nodorum (Figure
2e). These properties suggest that a homolog of ORF3 was lost
from part A of the M. grisea cluster, after the tandem duplication occurred. Furthermore, we speculate that the location
of ORF3 on the boundary between parts A and B may indicate
that the tandem duplication event visible in M. grisea
involved a recombination between two copies of this gene.
Gene order and orientation is quite poorly conserved among
the ACE1 clusters, as is typical of many secondary metabolism
gene clusters [7,8,28]. This makes it all the more striking that
the duplicated M. grisea genes each have one copy in the part
A and one copy in part B. Because the tandem duplication
that is evident in the M. grisea genome is not particularly
recent (it predates the M. grisea/C. globosum speciation), we
suggest that some form of selection has acted on gene order in
the cluster, preventing intermixing of the two parts. In this
context it is notable that recombination seems to be inhibited

in the M. grisea ACE1 cluster, because it displays a low frequency of targeted gene replacement, even in a KU80 null
mutant background where homologous recombination rates
are increased ([29]; Collemare et al, unpublished results).
The way that part A and part B genes of the ACE1 cluster are
distributed among species may indicate that they are involved
in the biosynthesis of different molecules. Alternatively, parts
A and B of the ACE1 cluster may be each involved in the biosynthesis of independent polyketide precursors that are fused
into a final complex molecule as observed for lovastatin
[25,30,31]. The fact that all 15 genes in the M. grisea ACE1
cluster are co-expressed at a very specific stage of the infection process (Collemare et al, unpublished results) favors the
hypothesis that both part A and part B genes are involved in
same biosynthetic pathway. However, gene knockout experiments have shown that two part B genes (RAP2 and SYN2)
are not essential for the avirulence function supported up to
now only by the part A gene ACE1 (Collemare et al, unpublished results). These latter results suggest that part A and
part B genes could be involved in the biosynthesis of two different molecules, with only one (ACE1, part A pathway) being
recognized by resistant rice cultivars. However, these two
hypotheses are both plausible, and await the biochemical
characterization of the Ace1 metabolite.

way" genes in ascomycete yeasts [48]. Hall and Dietrich [48]
noted that genes whose products function in dispensable
pathways are one of the few categories of genes in S. cerevisiae that are physically organized into gene clusters. They
found that the pathway for biotin synthesis was lost in a yeast
ancestor and then regained in the S. cerevisiae lineage by a
combination of HGT from bacteria and gene duplication with
neofunctionalization. One possible explanation for this
strange pattern of evolution could be that an intermediate in
the pathway is toxic [48], although there is no direct experimental evidence of this. If a pathway can confer a selective
advantage in some circumstances but also involves the production of a toxic intermediate, there can be strong selection
in favor of the pathway in some conditions and strong selection against it in others. The consequences of such a situation
could include the formation of physical gene clusters (to
reduce the chances of coding for only part of the pathway, or
for strong repression of transcription mediated by chromatin
remodelling), and occasional selection for re-gain of function
by HGT. Further exploration of this hypothesis will require
the discovery of more examples of similar sets of genes, and
detailed characterization of the biochemical pathways
involved.

HGT of a fungal secondary metabolism gene cluster

Materials and methods

Although the genomics era has uncovered evidence for widespread horizontal gene transfer among prokaryotes [32,33],
and from prokaryotes to eukaryotes [17,34-37] or vice versa
[38,39], relatively few instances of horizontal gene transfer
have been documented from one eukaryote to another [4042]. Among fungi, the best documented is the transfer of a
virulence gene from S. nodorum to Pyrenophora triticirepens, which occurred only about 70 years ago [16]. In that
case, the transferred DNA fragment was about 11 kb in size
but contained only one gene. In this study we showed that
part B of the ACE1 cluster (30 kb in size, containing 5-6 genes)
was likely horizontally transferred from a close ancestor of M.
grisea (a Sordariomycete) into an ancestor of A. clavatus (a
Eurotiomyete). The mechanism by which HGT might have
occurred remains a matter of speculation, but could perhaps
have involved hyphal fusion between species, or endocytosis.
Our inference of HGT is valid only if the Sordariomycete and
Eurotiomycete clades are monophyletic as shown in Figure 1,
but their monophyly is supported by several molecular and
systematic analyses [27,43-47].
To our knowledge, our study and the recent work of Patron et
al [18] are the first reported instances of HGT of groups of
linked genes involved in the same pathway between eukaryotic species. In both cases these secondary metabolite clusters
show a punctate (sporadic) distribution among other species,
with an ancestral cluster apparently having been lost by more
species than the number that retain it. This pattern of frequent losses of genes and their occasional reacquisition by
HGT resembles the pattern of evolution of "dispensable path-

We set up a local basic local alignment search tool (BLAST)
database of the proteins encoded in 26 completely sequenced
fungal genomes (A. niger, A. nidulans, A. terreus, A. flavus,
A. oryzae, A. clavatus, N. fischeri, A. fumigatus Af293, A.
fumigatus CEA10, C. immitis, C. posadasii, P. chrysogenum,
U. reesii, S. sclerotiorum, F. graminearum, F. oxysporum, F.
verticillioides, M. grisea, N. crassa, C. globosum, H. jecorina
(T. reesei), N. haematococca (F. solani), P. chrysosporium, S.
nodorum (P. nodorum), C.neoformans, U. maydis). To find
candidate ACE1-like clusters in other fungi, we used a twostep process outlined below.
In the first step, each protein encoded by the M. grisea ACE1
cluster was used as a query in protein-protein BLAST
(BLASTP) searches against this database, and for each query
the top 25 hits were retained provided that their E-values
were less than 1e-4. Each set of proteins was aligned using
ClustalW [49] and poorly aligned regions were removed using
Gblocks [50]. Sequence alignments are available as Additional data file 2. Maximum likelihood trees were constructed
using PHYML [51] with the JTT amino acid substitution
matrix and four categories of substitution rates. Bootstrapping was done using the default options in PHYML with 100
replicates per run. To avoid long branch attraction problems
we withdrew highly divergent sequences and repeated the
alignment and tree reconstruction steps on the new sets. We
also verified at each step that the alignment obtained after
running Gblocks represented at least 30% of the initial protein sequence. Genes were considered as orthologs of an M.

grisea ACE1 cluster gene if they grouped in a monophyletic
clade with a bootstrap support of ≥70%.
Many of the genes identified in this first step were located in
gene clusters. For each cluster so identified (defined as the
presence of at least two homologs of M. grisea ACE1 cluster
genes adjacent to one another) we then made a second step of
analysis, examining any other genes that are physically
located within these clusters but which were not picked up at
the first step (either because their BLASTP E-values were too
weak, or because they were not in the top 25 hits when the
database was searched). This process added genes
CHG05286.1, CHG05287.1, SNU00307.1 and FVEG_12610
