Spiders do not escape reproductive manipulations
by Wolbachia
Bram Vanthournout1†, Janne Swaegers1, Frederik Hendrickx1,2*†

Abstract
Background: Maternally inherited bacteria that reside obligatorily or facultatively in arthropods can increase their
prevalence in the population by altering their hosts’ reproduction. Such reproductive manipulations have been
reported from the major arthropod groups such as insects (in particular hymenopterans, butterflies, dipterans and
beetles), crustaceans (isopods) and mites. Despite the observation that endosymbiont bacteria are frequently
encountered in spiders and that the sex ratio of particular spider species is strongly female biased, a direct
relationship between bacterial infection and sex ratio variation has not yet been demonstrated for this arthropod
order.
Results: Females of the dwarf spider Oedothorax gibbosus exhibit considerable variation in the sex ratio of their
clutches and were infected with at least three different endosymbiont bacteria capable of altering host
reproduction i.e. Wolbachia, Rickettsia and Cardinium. Breeding experiments show that sex ratio variation in this
species is primarily maternally inherited and that removal of the bacteria by antibiotics restores an unbiased sex
ratio. Moreover, clutches of females infected with Wolbachia were significantly female biased while uninfected
females showed an even sex ratio. As female biased clutches were of significantly smaller size compared to nondistorted clutches, killing of male embryos appears to be the most likely manipulative effect.
Conclusions: This represents to our knowledge the first direct evidence that endosymbiont bacteria, and in
particular Wolbachia, might induce sex ratio variation in spiders. These findings are pivotal to further understand
the diversity of reproductive phenotypes observed in this arthropod order.

Background
Maternally inherited endosymbiont bacteria of arthropods received considerable attention owing to their ability to shape their hosts’ reproductive biology and
consequently their ecology and evolution [1-4]. The
strategies adopted by these microorganisms to increase
their fitness are surprisingly diverse and involve the
induction of parthenogenesis, killing of male offspring,
feminization of genetic males and cytoplasmic incompatibility, wherein, in its simplest form, the development
of an uninfected egg is inhibited if inseminated by
sperm of an infected male [2,4,5].
Recently, several molecular screening studies demonstrated that the degree of arthropod infection is

considerably higher than previously thought [6,7] and
that even up to 66% of arthropod species are thought to
be infected [8]. Despite the discovery of their widespread
occurrence within arthropods, knowledge about the
extent to which they may alter their hosts’ reproduction
is lagging behind. Even for some large taxonomic groups,
such as the order of spiders (Araneae), conclusive evidence is at present lacking. Nevertheless, some spider
species exhibit reproductive phenotypes similar to those
expected under endosymbiont infection such as parthenogenesis and primary sex ratio distortion in social as
well as solitary species (e.g. [9-15] and see [16] for an
extensive overview). In particular for solitary species, primary sex ratio distortion is commonly expected to result
from reproductive manipulation by endosymbionts as
Fisher’s sex-allocation theory generally predicts that an
equal sex ratio is the only evolutionary stable outcome
from the host’s perspective. Moreover, the prevalence
and diversity of endosymbiont bacteria in spiders is

among the highest within the arthropods and up to five
different endosymbionts capable of manipulating their
hosts’ reproductive biology have been found in several
spider families: Wolbachia, Rickettsia, Cardinium,
Arsenophonus and Spiroplasma [6,16-20].
Causal relationships between endosymbiont infection
and sex ratio distortion in spiders are up till now only
suggested by a difference in their prevalence between
males and females [6] or by an indirect relationship
[21]. Yet, as many other factors beside endosymbionts
might cause sex ratio distortion [1], multiple lines of
evidence such as maternal inheritance of sex ratio variation, use of different antibiotics that target an array of
different bacterial families and a direct relationship
between endosymbiont presence and sex ratio effect are
necessary to disentangle the impact of each endosymbiont on the produced sex ratio [5,22].
In this study, we report on sex ratio variation in the solitary spider Oedothorax gibbosus (Araneae: Linyphiidae: Erigoninae). This small dwarf spider has a palearctic
distribution and occurs exclusively in damp habitats such
as marshes and wet forests, where they reside in grass tussocks and patches of moss situated close to the water.
Besides the observation that the species exhibits a clear
male dimorphism with alternative mating strategies [23],
previous research showed primary sex ratio distortion with
an excess of females [24]. Here, we explore the potential
role of endosymbionts in inducing this sex ratio variation
by (i) unraveling the inheritance pattern of the sex ratio
trait, (ii) relating the presence of several endosymbiont bacteria with sex ratio variation and (iii) investigating whether
an equal sex ratio can be restored by antibiotic treatments.

showed considerable variation among clutches (Figure 1).
Posterior densities of both variance components show
that the largest source of sex ratio variation consists of
the maternally inherited part. As this variance is much
2
higher than zero (  m ; mean: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.34 - 1.05),
this is evidence that the observed sex ratio variation in
this species is strongly maternally inherited. However, a
smaller but still highly significant residual sex ratio varia2
tion (  e ) was observed (mean: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.12 - 0.47),
indicating that not all sex ratio variation in this species is
maternally inherited and that other factors of minor magnitude are additionally responsible for the among female
variation.
The clutch sex ratio was significantly related with the
size of the clutch (weighted Pearson correlation; r =
0.18; P = 0.01), with the proportion of sons being significantly lower in smaller clutches (Figure 1).
(ii) Endosymbiont identification and prevalence

Single individuals, sampled at two independent populations, tested positive for up to three different endosymbionts capable of altering host reproduction i.e.
Wolbachia, Cardinium and Rickettsia. For Wolbachia,
both sets of primers (i.e. wsp and Wolbachia specific
16S ribosomal DNA) gave consistent results. Sequences
of both genes could be read unambiguously and no
among individual variation was observed within the
obtained wsp and Wolbachia specific 16S sequences
([GenBank:HQ286290] and [GenBank:HQ286291]
respectively). This suggests that a single Wolbachia
strain is present in infected individuals. BLAST searches
for both genes returned the highest matches with available Wolbachia sequences (E-values < 1e-199). For wsp,
the obtained sequence clustered within supergroup G

Proportion of male offspring

Previous studies showed that sex ratio in O. gibbosus is
significantly female distorted, but varies considerably
among clutches [24]. If this observed sex ratio distortion
is caused by maternally inherited endosymbiont bacteria,
only daughters should inherit the sex ratio trait.
By means of an animal model (see Methods section)
applied to our extensive pedigree data, the variance in
sex ratio among females that is not attributed to sampling error is decomposed into a maternally inherited
2
part (  m ), which only incorporates this part of the sex
ratio variation that is transmitted to their daughters, and
2
a residual part (  e ) that estimates the remaining varia2
tion. Possible causes of  e to deviate from zero include
non-random variation in sex ratio among dams, for
instance due to loss of the bacterium, genetic variation
in resistance, direct paternal effects or other causes of
sex ratio variation.
The average sex ratio equalled 0.34 (95% CI: 0.31 0.36) and is hence significantly lower than 0.5, but

wherein infected females produced a significantly distorted sex ratio (mean ± SE: 0.36 ± 0.04; t37 = -3.70; P =
0.0007) while uninfected females produced a sex ratio
that was not significantly different from 0.5 (mean ± SE:
0.47 ± 0.02; t18.1 = -1.81; P = 0.086). The population a
female originated from did not have a significant effect
on the sex ratio (F1, 36.2 = 0.93; P = 0.340) and the effect
of the Wolbachia infection was not different between
both populations (F1, 36.2 = 0.20; P = 0.65). Within infection groups, no significant variation among females
could be detected (estimated variance component: 0.008
± 0.037; P = 0.59)
(iv) Antibiotics treatment

Sex ratio produced by females differed significantly
among treatments (F2, 34.6 = 4.67; P = 0.016; Figure 3).
While females of the control group produced a significantly distorted sex ratio (mean ± SE: 0.25 ± 0.03; t37.7
= -7.27; P < 0.0001), tetracycline treated females produced an even amount of males and females (mean ±
SE: 0.47 ± 0.08; t28.9 = -0.38; P = 0.7). Although females
treated with penicillin also produced a more even sex
ratio compared to the control treatment (mean ± SE:
0.36 ± 0.08; t40.2 = -1.56; P = 0.126), there was no significant difference compared to the sex ratio of both control and the tetracycline treated females (Tukey posthoc comparison: t39.9 = -1.35; P = 0.38 and t35 = -0.96;
P = 0.60 respectively). Although a single maternal line
was used for the experiment, there was still significant
variation among females (estimated variance component
0.55 ± 0.19; P = 0.002).

(See additional file 1: Bayesian inference tree of Wolbachia wsp sequences), which according to Rowley et al
[19] primarily comprises Wolbachia endosymbionts of
spiders. The recognition of this supergroup as a monophyletic clade has however recently been debated [25].
Sequences were most closely related with wsp sequences
found in the spiders Diaea circumlita [GenBank:
AY486092] and Hylyphantes graminicola [GenBank:
EU723842], the nematode Angiostrongylus cantonensis
[GenBank:AY508980] and the mosquito Malaya genurostris [GenBank:AY462865] (See additional file 1: Bayesian inference tree of Wolbachia wsp sequences). For
16S, the sequence could not be classified unambiguously
into one of the supergroups as defined in Lo et al [26]
and was most closely related to the Wolbachia 16S
sequence found in the spider Tetragnatha montana
[GenBank:EU333940](See additional file 2: Bayesian
inference tree of Wolbachia 16S sequences). Similarly,
sequences for Rickettsia and Cardinium were easily
readable and showed no variation ([GenBank:
HQ286289] and [GenBank:HQ286292] respectively).
The citrate partial sequence of Rickettsia clustered
within a monophyletic group that consists almost exclusively of Rickettsia sequences obtained from other spiders (See additional file 3: Bayesian inference tree of
partial citrate sequences of Rickettsia). The phylogenetic
position of the Cardinium sequence could not be positioned with high support among one of the other endosymbiont Cardinium sequences available at GenBank
(See additional file 4: Bayesian inference tree of Cardinium 16S sequences). For Spiroplasma, only a few faint
bands were visible after electrophoresis. However,
sequencing and BLAST searches revealed that these
were false positives and due to amplification of the bacteria Acidovorax.
Approximately half of the individuals were infected
with Wolbachia with 44% (n = 39) of the females and
57% (n = 7) of the males of the Damvallei testing positive. For the Walenbos population 42% (n = 53) of the
females and 64% (n = 11) of the males showed Wolbachia infection. There was no difference between the
sexes in infection frequency for both populations (Fisher’s exact test: P > 0.2) and no difference in infection
frequency between populations (P = 0.9). Prevalence of
Rickettsia and Cardinium was fixed in the two investigated populations.

(iii) Relationship between endosymbiont infection
and sex ratio

As virtually no variation in infection frequency was
observed for Cardinium and Rickettsia, female infection
with these endosymbionts is unlikely to explain the
maternal sex ratio variation. However, for Wolbachia,
infection status of the female had a significant effect on

Antibiotic treatment significantly influenced the number of hatched offspring of the first clutch (F2, 39 = 5.14;
P = 0.010). There was no significant difference in number of hatched offspring between control spiders (mean
± SE: 16.8 ± 1.6) and penicillin treated spiders (mean ±
SE: 9.8 ± 2.2; Tukey post-hoc comparison: t 39 = 2.25;

females treated with tetracycline (mean ± SE: 24.6 ± 4.5)
hatched compared to the penicillin treatment (Tukey

Discussion
Results of our three independent experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that sex ratio variation in the
solitary dwarf spider Oedothorax gibbosus is caused by
reproductive manipulations by endosymbiont bacteria.
First, as these bacteria are exclusively transmitted from
mother to offspring by means of her eggs, daughters of
sex ratio distorted females are expected to produce
female distorted clutches as well. In line with this, our
pedigree analysis shows that up to 70% of the sex ratio
variation among females that is not attributed to sampling error is maternally inherited. Second, PCR-assays
showed that Oedothorax gibbosus is infected with at least
three different endosymbionts known to potentially affect
reproductive behavior in arthropods namely: Wolbachia,
Rickettsia and Cardinium. Out of these, Wolbachia certainly affects sex ratio in our study species; infected
females produced a significantly female biased sex ratio
compared to the even sex ratio of Wolbachia uninfected
females. Third, the sex ratio manipulation by endosymbiont bacteria is further confirmed by treating distorted
females of bacteria with the antibiotic tetracycline, which

Page 4 of 9

restored the production of equal amounts of males and
females. Since juvenile survival was in general sufficiently
high (>85%) and all female clutches were found for
clutches with 100% juvenile survival, it is unlikely that
differential juvenile mortality rates of males and females
can account for the observed sex ratio bias. The combination of these results unequivocally demonstrates that,
among other potentially distorting endosymbionts, Wolbachia is able to manipulate sex ratio in spiders. This
represents to our knowledge the first clear evidence of a
causal relationship between endosymbiont infection and
its manipulative effect on host reproduction in spiders.
Several studies confirm the prevalence of several
endosymbiont bacteria in the Araneae order, but convincing evidence of their effects on the hosts’ reproductive biology is currently lacking. As argued by Weeks
et al. [22], the establishment of multiple lines of evidence are a prerequisite to confirm the manipulative
effect exhibited by these microorganisms. Previously,
one such connection has been suggested by Gunnarsson
et al. [21] who found an effect of female size on female
post-copulatory position, which in turn affects brood
sex ratio in Pityohyphantes phrygianus. This effect is
altered by an interaction of the Wolbachia infection status of the male and infected female size which makes
the observed effect indirect and subject to female control. Duron et al. [6] suggested manipulative effects by
reporting a sex biased prevalence of Wolbachia in the
spiders Tetragnatha montana and Meta mengei. It
remains however unknown whether sex ratio distortion
is present in those species.
Identifying the phylogenetic position of the Wolbachia
strain of Oedothorax gibbosus might help to further
explore the incidence of reproductive manipulations by
Wolbachia in spiders. Based on the wsp sequences, the
strain present in our study species is situated within
supergroup G, previously reported by Rowley et al. [19]
to be spider specific and has highest similarities with the
strains found in the spider genera Diaea and Dysdera.
These genera are known to exhibit primary sex ratio
distortion (Diaea [15]) and parthenogenesis induction
(Dysdera [12]). The classification of these sequences
into a monophyletic distinct clade G is however not well
supported, not only as it is merely based on a single
gene, but additionally because it has been suggested to
represent a recombinant of the supergroup A and B wsp
sequences [25]. For 16S, unambiguous classification into
one of the existing supergroups could not be supported,
but it is most closely related to the sequences found in
the spider Tetragnatha montana. Remarkably, this was
also one of the two species out of the 26 spiders species
tested by Duron et al. [6] where a manipulative effect of
Wolbachia was suggested based on a higher prevalence
in females compared to males.

Notwithstanding, whilst Wolbachia obviously plays an
important role in the reproductive biology of O. gibbosus,
our findings also point out that there is no simple one-toone relationship between infection status and sex ratio distortion. First, if Wolbachia infection status alone was
responsible for sex ratio variation, all among female variation would be expected to be inherited maternally. Our
pedigree analysis in contrast revealed that a smaller
though significant part of the among female variation is
not strictly inherited from mother to daughters. Although
the most straightforward explanation would be an imperfect transmission of the bacterium towards offspring, PCR
screening demonstrated for a subset of the data that
infected females (n = 4) only produced infected offspring
(n = 47), indicating very high transmission efficiencies.
Paternal effects, whether caused by meiotic drive, i.e. the
unequal production of male and female producing sperm
[27], or suppression of the manipulative effect by nuclear
genes [28,29] are therefore more plausible mechanisms.
Second, paternal effects are also suggested from the antibiotics treatment experiment; although a single maternal
line was used there is still significant variation among
females within the control treatment, which could be
explained by the fact that females were mated with different males. Variation in Wolbachia titer, potentially
induced by Wolbachia specific bacteriophages, may also
substantially affect the expression of the manipulative
effect [30]. It remains however at present less understood
which factors determine Wolbachia concentrations in
arthropods [31]. Third, a relative large proportion of males
are still infected with Wolbachia, indicating an imperfect
manipulative effect or the presence of resistance genes in
both populations. Wolbachia infection of field captured
individuals even suggests a higher prevalence in males
compared to females, although this can be most probably
attributed to sampling error. Indeed, given that the
observed prevalence averaged over both populations
equals 0.45, and that the observed sex ratio of infected
females averages 0.36, the estimated proportion of individuals that are male and infected (i.e. males that originate
from infected females) equals (0.45)*(0.36) = 0.162. Likewise, the proportion of individuals that are male and uninfected (i.e. males that originate from uninfected females)
equals (0.55)*(0.5) = 0.275. Hence, the estimated proportion of infected males equals 0.162/(0.162 + 0.275) = 0.37.
An exact binomial test however reveals that the observation of 11 infected males out of 18 males tested is not sufficient to reject the hypothesis that only 37% of the males
are infected (P = 0.07).
Multiple species of endosymbionts were found to
infect the same individual, which creates the opportunity
for interaction effects to occur. Our use of several antibiotics that target different endosymbiont species allows
to investigate the potential occurrence of such

Page 5 of 9

interaction effects. However, penicillin treated females,
expected to only target Cardinium, did not result in a
significantly different offspring sex ratio compared to
the control and tetracycline treatment. Therefore no
indications of the potential additional effect of Cardinium on the sex ratio could be observed.
It is known that Wolbachia can induce several reproductive alterations like parthenogenesis induction, malekilling and feminization [2,4,5]. Parthenogenesis induction is highly unlikely to occur since no offspring were
produced by unmated females (pers. obs.). A female
biased sex ratio can further be caused both by male killing and feminization. If male killing is present, the number of hatched offspring from infected females is
typically half of that from uninfected females since male
embryos are selectively killed. Feminization, however,
converts genetic males into phenotypic females which
results in an equal number of hatching offspring.
Based on our pedigree data, we found a significant positive correlation between clutch size and proportion of
sons in each clutch, wherein smaller clutches were significantly more female biased. This points into the direction
of killing of male embryos as the most likely manipulating
mechanism. Nevertheless, more exclusive evidence could
have been obtained from the antibiotics treatment.
Although the higher hatching rate of tetracycline treated
individuals approached twice the clutch size of control
females, which is congruent with the expectations under
male killing, this difference was not significant. The difficulty to clearly infer about the possible manipulating
mechanism in our study species is most likely attributed
to the large variance in clutch size (see Figure 1). Relationships between clutch size and sex ratio could therefore
only be observed for the extensive pedigree data set.
Recognizing the effect of microorganisms on the
reproductive biology of spiders is of high importance to
further understand the mechanisms that cause the pronounced diversity of reproductive phenotypes observed
in this arthropod order. At least for our male dimorphic
study species [23], the sex ratio distorting effect of Wolbachia could be involved in the stable coexistence of
both distinct male phenotypes through its influence on
sexual selection, as suggested by theoretical [32] as well
as empirical [33] investigations. In addition, our findings
of an important role of endosymbionts on sex ratio distortion might provide a useful framework to decipher
the mechanisms that cause parthenogenesis in spiders
[14] and the facilitation of adaptive sex ratio adjustments that are commonly observed in social spiders to
reduce male mate competition [9,34].

Conclusions
In this study we adopted a threefold strategy to corroborate the role of endosymbiont bacteria in causing a

Vanthournout et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:15
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/15

female distorted sex ratio in the solitary dwarf spider
Oedothorax gibbosus. (i) Pedigree analysis confirms that
the sex ratio trait is primarily maternally inherited, (ii)
PCR-assays show that individuals are infected with up
to three endosymbionts known to cause reproductive
alterations in arthropods, i.e. Wolbachia, Rickettsia and
Cardinium and that females infected with Wolbachia
produce significantly more females than males compared to uninfected females. (iii) Antibiotic treatment of
Wolbachia infected females restores the production of
an equal amount of males and females. This is the first
direct evidence of endosymbiont interference in reproductive characteristics in the Araneae order. These findings can have major implications on understanding the
mechanism causing the variety of reproductive phenotypes present in spider species.

Methods
(i) Maternal inheritance of sex ratio variation

To estimate the among female variance in clutch sex
ratio and decompose it into a maternally inherited and
residual component, a total of 192 females were captured in a wet forest ("Walenbos”, Belgium) and mated
with males from the same population. Offspring were
bred for five consecutive generations in the lab, which
resulted in a total of 3884 offspring originating from
414 different females. Spiders were reared individually in
plastic vials of 5 cm diameter and 2,5 cm height. Plaster
was added to the bottom and moistened to keep humidity levels at 100%. A piece of moss was provided to
allow the construction of a functional web. The vials
were placed in a climate chamber with a constant temperature of 20°C and light-dark regime of 16L-8D. Juveniles were fed with an overabundance of springtails
(Sinella curviseta) and after the third moult an excess of
fruit flies (Drosophila sp.) was provided. Vials were
checked several times a week for food and humidity
level. After reaching adulthood one male was placed in
the vial of the female. The male was removed after at
least 24h. Mated females were allowed to lay cocoons in
the vial they were reared in. Sex was determined upon
reaching adulthood by visual inspection using a stereomicroscope and tertiary sex ratio, defined as number of
male offspring divided by the total number of adult offspring, was assessed.
Presence of a maternally inherited sex ratio variation
2
and an estimate of its variance (  m ) over multiple generations was obtained by means of an animal model [35]
in which maternal effects were updated using Gibbs
sampling. It is an extension of a model developed by
[36] to estimate additive genetic effects for continuous
traits in pedigrees.
More specifically, let Yi be the sex of offspring i and
let d,i refer to the mother of the i’th offspring, then Yi

Page 6 of 9

was modelled following a Bernoulli distribution with
mean πd,i, i.e. the sex ratio of the dam d, where
⎛  d ,i
ln ⎜
⎜ 1−
d ,i
⎝

⎞
⎟ =  + m d ,i + e d ,i
⎟
⎠

with μ the average logit sex ratio in the population, md,i
the maternally inherited sex ratio effect and ed,i the sex
ratio effect that is not captured in md,i. Possible causes of
ed,i to deviate from zero include additional variation in
sex ratio among dams that is not attributed to sampling
error. As sex ratio data are obtained over multiple generations in the pedigree, md,i can be updated separately
from ed,i by means of a recursive equation that sets the
maternally inherited sex ratio effect of a particular
mother equal to that of her daughters, i.o.w. mi = md,i.
Hence, md,i of a particular dam is updated from both the
sex ratio she produces as well as the sex ratio that her
(grand)mother(s) and (grand)daughters produce. Following this procedure, the posterior distribution of the var2
2
iance in md,i and ed,i, i.e.  m and  e respectively, was
obtained and used to calculate a point estimate based on
the mean of the distribution and a 95% credibility interval
(CI). The model was fitted using a Bayesian approach as
implemented in the program WinBugs v.1.4. A gamma
(0.1, 0.1) was chosen as a prior distribution for sm and
se. Two independent MCMC chains, each with different
starting values, were run simultaneously for 12.000 generations. The first 2.000 generations were discarded as
burn-in period.
We also fitted a more complex model that included a
genetic component that contributes to the sex ratio variation. However, visual inspection of the independent
MCMC’s indicated that no convergence and, hence, no
reliable estimates of the variance components could be
obtained.
To explore which manipulation is involved, we correlated clutch size and clutch sex ratio. Ideally, killing of
male offspring by endosymbiont bacteria reduces the
clutch size to half the clutch size produced by nonmanipulated females. Feminization and parthenogenesis
on the other hand are expected to have no effect on
clutch size. We related clutch size and clutch sex ratio
by means of a Pearson correlation, wherein the estimate
of the clutch sex ratio was weighed by the clutch size in
order to down weight the inaccurate sex ratio estimates
of small clutches.
(ii) Endosymbiont detection and prevalence

Infection status and screening of endosymbionts was
performed by means of PCR with endosymbiont specific
primers. DNA was extracted from whole spiders with
the Nucleospin Tissue kit (©Machery Nagel) following
the manufacturers recommended protocol.

Spiders were screened for four different endosymbionts that are known to alter host reproduction in
arthropods and that are already detected in spiders by
means of the following specific primers: (i) WSP81F and
WSP691R [7] to amplify a part of the cell surface protein coding gene of Wolbachia (wsp) and 16Swolb99F
and 16Swolb994R [37] to selectively amplify the 16S
ribosomal RNA gene of Wolbachia; (ii) CLO-f1 and
CLO-r1 [38] to selectively amplify ~468bp part of the
16S rRNA gene of Cardinium; (iii) RICS741F and
RICT1197R, which amplify a part of the citrate gene of
Rickettsia [39] and (iv) SP-ITS-J04 and SP-ITS-N55 [40]
to selectively amplify the spacer region between 16S and
23S rRNA genes of Spiroplasma ixodetis. To investigate
whether Wolbachia detection in our study species was
not confounded by the presence of Wolbachia in prey
items, one sample of three fruitflies and one of 20
springtails were screened. None of these samples
showed any traces of Wolbachia. PCR conditions were
as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec,
annealing (54°C, 30 sec), extension (72°C, 90 sec) and a
final extension at 72°C during 5 min. Electrophoresis
was performed on a 1,5% agarose gel. The primers 3F
and 9R [41], which amplify part of the 18S rDNA, were
used as a positive control. Gels were stained in a solution of GELRED and bands were visualized by UVfluorescence.
PCR products were sequenced using BigDye Terminator Sequencing mix and run on an ABI 3710 automated
sequencer for a random sample of five to ten independent individuals to validate primer specificity and to test
for the presence of different strains. Sequences were
aligned with the ClustalW algorithm implemented in
MEGA4 [42] with sequences from other spiders available in GenBank (mainly reported in the studies
[6,17,20]). The closest relatives of the obtained endosymbiont sequences were identified by BLAST searches.
Phylogenetic position and similarity of the endosymbionts with those of other spider species were analyzed
based on a Bayesian Inference using MrBayes [43] with
posterior probability support values calculated for the
nodes. We assumed a general time reversible model of
DNA substitution allowing a proportion of invariant
sites and gamma distributed variation in substitution
rate among sites (GTR + I + G) for all four DNA fragments. Four simultaneous chains (two cold, two heated)
were run for two million generations and trees were
sampled every 1000 generations. To check convergence
and stability of the parameter estimates and to determine the burn-in value, we used Tracer 1.3 [44] to
inspect the log files.
Prevalence of the bacteria was tested in two populations in Belgium, i.e. “Walenbos”, being the same

Page 7 of 9

locality where spiders of the breeding experiment (i) originated from (n = 53 and n = 11 females and males
respectively) and a second population “Damvallei” situated approximately 100 km westward (n = 39 and n = 7
females and males respectively).
(iii) Relationship between endosymbiont infection
and sex ratio

Spiders used for investigating the prevalence of the
infections and testing the relationship between endosymbiont presence and sex ratio originated from hand
catches carried out in the two populations mentioned
earlier. Only juvenile and subadult spiders were used to
ensure that females were virgin at the start of the
experiment. Spiders were reared under the same conditions as mentioned above. At adulthood, females (n =
15 and n = 19 for Damvallei and Walenbos respectively)
were mated with males of the same population and
their offspring (n = 446 and n = 485 for Damvallei and
Walenbos respectively) were reared individually till
adulthood to determine offspring sex ratio and survival.
Females were stored in ethanol after the production of
three cocoons and afterwards screened for the presence
of endosymbionts. If a female died before being stored,
daughters were screened for endosymbiont presence.
Only a single daughter was inspected if the result was
positive and the mother was considered to be infected.
In the case of a negative result, two additional daughters
were screened and if these results were also negative the
mother was considered to be uninfected. Offspring of a
few females (number of females: n = 2 and n = 5 for
Damvallei and Walenbos respectively) were reared for a
second generation to increase sample size (number of
offspring: n = 74 and n = 93 for Damvallei and Walenbos respectively). Significance of a relationship between
endosymbiont infection and sex ratio was tested by
means of a generalized linear mixed model (Proc GLIMMIX in SAS v.9.1.2) with endosymbiont presence/
absence, population and their interaction as fixed effects.
To correct for sex ratio variation among females which
may inflate the error degrees of freedom, female was
included as a random effect.
(iv) Antibiotics treatment

To test whether an equal sex ratio can be restored after
removal of the endosymbionts, we treated one highly
distorted maternal line known to be infected with Wolbachia, Rickettsia and Cardinium with antibiotics. This
line originated from the breeding experiment to test the
relationship between endosymbiont infection and sex
ratio distortion (see Methods section iii) and was kept
in the lab for 7 generations. At generation 4, two
females were mated with an unrelated male and 18 offspring from each female were randomly assigned to

Vanthournout et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:15
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/15

three different treatments i.e. (i) untreated (to continue
the control line and reared as mentioned above), (ii) tetracycline hydrochloride treatment which eliminates Wolbachia, Rickettsia and Cardinium (0.1%, w/v; 0.002 M),
(iii) penicillin treatment which only eliminates Cardinium (0.1%, w/v; 0.003 M)[38,45]. Antibiotics were
applied by moistening the vials permanently with the
antibiotics solution. Although tetracycline is bacteriostatic [46] and does not remove the bacteria but renders
them inactive, PCR screening of antibiotics treated individuals demonstrated that tetracycline removed Wolbachia for about half of the specimens. For the remaining
individuals, only faint PCR bands, often out of the
expected range of the PCR product size were observed.
After reaching adulthood, females of each treatment
were mated with unrelated males and sex ratio and survival of the clutches was determined (number of
females: n = 39, n = 7 and n = 8 for control, penicillin
and tetracycline treatment respectively). Differences in
average clutch sex ratio between the treatments were
analyzed by means of a generalized linear mixed model
(Proc GLIMMIX in SAS v. 9.1.2) with treatment as
fixed effect. To account for dependence in sex ratio
among clutches, mother (factor DAM) was included as
a random effect. Survival was generally high and did not
differ between spiders treated with tetracycline (mean ±
SE: 0.86 ± 0.06), penicillin (mean ± SE: 0.87 ± 0.07) and
control spiders (mean ± SE: 0.92 ± 0.02) (Generalized
Linear Mixed Model; treatment effect: F2, 40 = 0.89; P =
0.42), indicating that administering antibiotics did not
influence offspring survival.
