Abstract
Background: The thioredoxin and/or glutathione pathways occur in all organisms. They provide electrons for
deoxyribonucleotide synthesis, function as antioxidant defenses, in detoxification, Fe/S biogenesis and participate in a
variety of cellular processes. In contrast to their mammalian hosts, platyhelminth (flatworm) parasites studied so far,
lack conventional thioredoxin and glutathione systems. Instead, they possess a linked thioredoxin-glutathione system
with the selenocysteine-containing enzyme thioredoxin glutathione reductase (TGR) as the single redox hub that
controls the overall redox homeostasis. TGR has been recently validated as a drug target for schistosomiasis and new
drug leads targeting TGR have recently been identified for these platyhelminth infections that affect more than 200
million people and for which a single drug is currently available. Little is known regarding the genomic structure of
flatworm TGRs, the expression of TGR variants and whether the absence of conventional thioredoxin and glutathione
systems is a signature of the entire platyhelminth phylum.
Results: We examine platyhelminth genomes and transcriptomes and find that all platyhelminth parasites (from
classes Cestoda and Trematoda) conform to a biochemical scenario involving, exclusively, a selenium-dependent
linked thioredoxin-glutathione system having TGR as a central redox hub. In contrast, the free-living platyhelminth
Schmidtea mediterranea (Class Turbellaria) possesses conventional and linked thioredoxin and glutathione systems. We
identify TGR variants in Schistosoma spp. derived from a single gene, and demonstrate their expression. We also provide
experimental evidence that alternative initiation of transcription and alternative transcript processing contribute to the
generation of TGR variants in platyhelminth parasites.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that thioredoxin and glutathione pathways differ in parasitic and free-living
flatworms and that canonical enzymes were specifically lost in the parasitic lineage. Platyhelminth parasites possess a
unique and simplified redox system for diverse essential processes, and thus TGR is an excellent drug target for
platyhelminth infections. Inhibition of the central redox wire hub would lead to overall disruption of redox homeostasis
and disable DNA synthesis.
Background
Platyhelminths (commonly known as flatworms) are a
metazoan phylum that includes the neodermata lineage,
composed exclusively of parasitic taxa, and the turbellaria
lineage, mostly composed of free-living taxa [1]. Neodermatan flatworms comprise the classes Cestoda, Trematoda and Monogenea, of which the first two include the
agents of serious human diseases. Notably, trematode
infections caused by Schistosoma spp. affect more than
200 million people in Africa, South America and Asia [2].

Cestode infections are less prevalent, but include severe
human diseases such as cysticercosis and hydatid disease,
caused by Taenia solium and Echinococcus spp., respectively [3]. As yet, there is no vaccine that can prevent
platyhelminth infections in humans, neither there are trials underway. Although chemotherapy is the mainstay of
control, very few effective drugs are currently used to
treat platyhelminth infections, being praziquantel the single drug readily available for schistosomiasis treatment
[4]
In most organisms, including the mammalian hosts of
platyhelminth parasites, cellular redox homeostasis, antioxidant defenses and supply of electrons for deoxyribonucleotide synthesis rely on two major and independent

pathways: the glutathione (GSH) and the thioredoxin
(Trx) systems [5], which have overlapping and differential
targets, and function in a great variety of biological processes. These pathways operate through redox cascades
that involve transfer of reducing equivalents from
NADPH to targets through a series of dithiol-disulfide
reactions or variations of this theme (e.g. when selenocysteine, Sec, replaces cysteine) [6]. The core enzymes of
these pathways are glutathione reductase (GR) and thioredoxin reductase (TR), both of which are pyridinenucleotide thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases that reduce
the oxidized tripeptide glutathione (GSSG) and the oxidized disulfide reductase thioredoxin (Trx), respectively.
In turn, GSH and Trx transfer electrons to downstream
targets. Platyhelminth parasites, unlike their mammalian
hosts, lack conventional GR and TR enzymes, and hence
canonical thioredoxin and glutathione systems [7-9].
Instead, they possess a linked glutathione thioredoxin
system that relies exclusively on the selenoenzyme thioredoxin glutathione reductase (TGR) for provision of
reducing equivalents to both pathways. TGR achieves
this broad substrate specificity by a fusion of an N-terminal glutaredoxin (Grx) domain to TR domains [10]. In
the platyhelminth parasite Echinococcus granulosus,
cytosolic and mitochondrial TGR variants derived from
a single gene have been reported [11] and functional thioredoxin-glutathione systems have been recently
described in both compartments [12], whereas only a
cytosolic variant of TGR has been described in S. mansoni [13]. The differences in the thioredoxin and glutathione pathways between parasitic flatworms and their
mammalian hosts, and the lack of redundancy of these
redox pathways have prompted studies which have
recently resulted in validation of TGR as a novel drug
target for platyhelminths [14]. Indeed, new drug leads
have been identified by quantitative high-throughput
screenings using Schistosoma mansoni TGR as a target
[15].
The fact that TGR is an essential enzyme that controls
the overall redox homeostasis in these parasites warrants
further studies on flatworm TGRs. In particular, little is
known relating the genomic structure of flatworm TGRs,
whether additional TGR variants are expressed, and how
the variants are generated. More importantly, it is not
known whether the presence of TGR and the absence of
TR and GR genes is a signature of the platyhelminth lineage. In this work, we report that additional parasitic flatworms possess TGR and lack TR and GR. In contrast, the
free-living platyhelminth Schmidtea mediterranea possesses TR, GR and TGR genes. In addition we investigate
the existence, generation and expression of TGR variants
in parasitic flatworms.

Results
Analysis of thioredoxin and glutathione systems in freeliving and parasitic platyhelminths

We carried out an exhaustive in silico analysis of available
genome and transcriptome data from platyhelminth
organisms to examine the presence of TGR, TR and GR
sequences. A tblastn search of the E. multilocularis
genome using E. granulosus TGR sequence as protein
query revealed that E. multilocularis genome possesses a
single TGR gene and lacks genes encoding conventional
TR or GR, consistent with previous experimental evidence from E. granulosus. E. multilocularis TGR is a selenoprotein: its gene contains an in-frame TGA codon as
well as a SECIS element. Echinococcus TGR orthologs are
virtually identical; they possess 95% identity at the nucleotide level and 98% identity at the amino acid level (Figure 1). On the other hand tblastn searches of the S.
mediterranea genome revealed that, in contrast to the
parasitic flatworms E. multilocularis (class Cestoda) and
Schistosoma spp. (class Trematoda), the free-living platyhelminth S. mediterranea (class Turbellaria) possesses a
TR gene, a GR gene and a TGR gene. The coding
sequences of S. mediterranea TR, GR and TGR were predicted based on EST sequences when available; final
adjustments of intron-exon boundaries were performed
based on a multiple alignment of TRs, GRs and TGRs
from different species. The deduced amino acid
sequences are shown in Figure 1. All S. mediterranea
pyridine-nucleotide thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases identified contain the canonical CX4C redox center. Both TR
and TGR genes from S. mediterranea contain an in-frame
TGA codon and a SECIS element, and thus encode selenoproteins, with a GCUG (U denotes selenocysteine) Cterminal redox center. S. mediterranea TGR possesses a
dithiol Grx domain, containing the CPFC redox active
center, similar to S. japonicum TGR and TGRs from other
organisms. The TR gene from S. mediterranea has higher
identity to mammalian mitochondrial TRs. Indeed, an
exon encoding a putative mitochondrial leader peptide
was detected upstream of the TR coding sequence. In the
absence of additional platyhelminth genomes sequenced,
we searched databases for expressed TRs, GRs and TGRs
of other flatworms. A tblastn search identified a cDNA
encoding a Sec-containing full-length TGR from the
platyhelminth parasite Fasciola hepatica (class Trematoda), with high similarity to Schistosoma TGRs and containing the canonical CPYC redox center at the Grx
domain, the CX4C redox center of pyridine-nucleotide
thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases, and a Sec-containing Cterminal redox motif. Additionally, a tblastn search
revealed ESTs encoding a fragment of a TGR from the
platyhelminth parasite Taenia solium (class Cestoda).
This TGR is highly similar to Echinococcus TGRs. Figure

Figure 1 Amino acid sequence alignment of TR, GR and TGRs of platyhelminths. Sec is indicated by U. The position of the redox active residues
in the sequences is indicated by a star. Conserved residues in all proteins are highlighted in dark grey, conserved residues in the Grx domain of TGRs
are highlighted in light grey. Location of the Grx domain is indicated above the sequence. ORFs for TGR, TR and GR from S. mediterranea (SCHME) genome (assembly 31) were predicted in the contigs 000676, 000203 and 001663, respectively. ORF for E. multilocularis (ECHMU) TGR was assembled
from contigs 0007357 and 0007358. Full-length TGR sequences of S. mansoni (SCHMA),S. japonicum (SCHJA), E. granulosus (ECHGR), and F. hepatica
(FASHE) were retrieved from Genebank (gb|AAK85233.1|AF395822_1, gb|AAW25951.1, emb|CAM96615.1, and gb|AAN63052.1, respectively). T. solium
(TAESO) TGR partial sequences were retrieved from the EST repository at Genebank (gb|EL757065.1 and gb|EL743442.1). The putative mitochondrial
leader peptide of S. mediterranea TGR is not included in the sequence, neither leader peptide variants of Schistosoma and Echinococcus TGRs. Sequences were aligned with Clustal W2 [29], with final manual adjustment after inspection.

1 shows an alignment of flatworm TGRs, and S. mediterranea TR and GR.
The SECIS elements of flatworm TGRs and TR are
shown in Figure 2. All SECIS structures fit very well the
eukaryotic SECIS consensus model, containing a nonWatson-Crick quartet in the SECIS core and unpaired
AA in the apical loop. Beyond these regions, little
sequence conservation was detected between flatworm
TGR SECIS elements.
Phylogenetic analysis of TRs, GRs and TGRs showed
that platyhelminth TGRs conform a clade. We could not
determine whether platyhelminth TGR is more related to
mammalian TR1 (also known as cytosolic TR) or mammalian TGR (Figure 3). S. mediterranea TR and GR clustered with mammalian mitochondrial TRs and GRs,
respectively. Overall, these results indicate that thioredoxin and glutathione pathways differ in flatworms, and
suggest that the TR and GR genes present in the planarian lineage were lost in the neodermata lineage (Figure 3).
Finally, a distant paralog of TGR, corresponding to dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, was identified in all flatworm genomes.
Analysis of platyhelminth TGR gene structure

To gain further insights on the structure and evolution of
platyhelminth TGRs, we determined the sequence of E.
granulosus gene and analyzed it together with the
sequences of TGRs, TRs and GRs available from flat-

worm genome projects (E. multilocularis, S. mansoni, S.
japonicum and S. mediterranea). The comparison of the
gene structure revealed high conservation between parasitic flatworm TGR genes. Indeed, Schistosoma spp. and
Echinococcus spp. TGR genes contained 17 exons of similar sizes for the four species; most exons were small and
the longest was the last exon that contained the 3' UTR,
including the SECIS element (Table 1). Interestingly,
introns were also very well conserved between Echinococcus and Schistosoma in the glutaredoxin domain; in the
TR domains, introns were significantly longer in Schistosoma spp. A closer inspection revealed that E. granulosus
and E. multilocularis genes were virtually identical, with
the single significant difference of 175 nucleotide insertion at intron 15 (see Table 1), whereas S. mansoni and S.
japonicum sequences differed more markedly in the
intron sizes, in particular in the TR domain.
The gene structure of S. mediterranea TGR was similar
to those of Echinococcus and Schistosoma TGRs, but had
clear differences as well. Indeed, S. mediterranea TGR
possessed 12 exons, instead of 17. We could not detect
the exon containing the signal peptide in the S. mediterranea TGR gene, although its presence could not be ruled
out, since signal peptide sequences are often poorly conserved. Thus, four events of exon fusion/split appeared to
have occurred between neodermata and turbellaria lineages (see Table 1). Interestingly, the exon fusion/split
events were not equally distributed in the TGR gene

Figure 3 Phylogenetic relationships of GRs, TRs and TGRs of platyhelminths and mammals. TRs, GRs and TGRs from platyhelminths and mammals were aligned with Clustal W2 [29]. Human dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLDH) was used as outgroup. A Neighbor-Joining tree was constructed using MEGA4 [30] with pairwise deletion and default parameters. A condensed tree is shown, and bootstrap values of reliable nodes (above
50) are indicated. The polytomy displayed at the TGR node denotes that the evolutionary relationships within the node can not be resolved with at
least 50% of bootstrap support. In other words, nodes with less than 50% of bootstrap support were collapsed and are displayed as polytomies. The
results indicate that the TR and GR genes present in the planarian lineage were lost in the neodermata lineage. Very similar topology and statistical
support were obtained using different phylogenetic reconstruction methods (i.e. Maximum Parsimony, UPMGA and Minimum Evolution). ECHGR: E.
granulosus, ECHMU: E. multilocularis, TAESO: T. Solium, SCHMA: S. mansoni, SCHJA: S. japonicum, SMED: S. mediterranea, FASHE: F. hepatica.

sequence; they occurred in the coding sequence corresponding to the C-terminal half of TGR. Thus, the gene
structure appeared to have more constraints at the Grx
domain than at the interface domain. In turn, S. mediterranea TR and GR genes displayed a completely different
exon/intron structure than platyhelminth TGR genes.
Finally, since only a handful of genes from Echinococcus
have been sequenced, we analyzed in detail various
aspects of Echinococcus TGR genes. We examined exonintron boundaries to identify common features and differences (Additional file 1 shows all the exon-intron
boundaries of TGR gene). All but one intron contained
the canonical GU-AG donor-acceptor sites, typical of
eukaryotic nuclear pre-mRNA, being the donor site of
intron 15 the exception to the consensus. In addition, we
searched for conserved bases or motifs around the splice
sites and found that C or A followed by a purine (A or G)
preceded the 5' GU splice site in most cases; and that U or
A was present at the -3 base with respect to the 3'AG
splice site (Additional file 1). The T+A content in TGR
introns was 59% (contrasting 50.7% in exons), indicating a
neutral mutational bias towards T+A, as previously noted
for Echinococcus genes [16]. The small size of all Echinococcus TGR introns is noteworthy: while Echinococcus
TGR genes span 6 kb, S. mediterranea and Schistosoma
spp genes are significantly longer. These data agree with
the previous observations that Echinococcus genes possess small introns [16]. Taken as a whole, our results are

also in agreement with previous findings that both Echinococcus species are remarkably similar with regard to
sequence information.
Identification of TGR variants in platyhelminths

We have previously demonstrated the existence of mitochondrial and cytosolic TGR variants derived from a single gene in E. granulosus. In order to identify TGR
variants expressed in other flatworms, we performed a
tblastn search at the NCBI server (EST others option).
Only a single TGR variant was identified in the case of S.
mediterranea. In the case of S. japonicum, ESTs encoding
two additional TGR variants to the already reported cytosolic TGR were identified, whereas a single additional
variant was identified in S. mansoni. Similarly to what has
been described in E. granulosus, the Schistosoma cDNAs
encode variants differing in their N-termini (Figure 4).
One of the S. japonicum variants (TGR_SCHJA_v1)
would encode an N-terminal mitochondrial signal peptide. The other S. japonicum variant (TGR_SCHJA_v2)
and the S. mansoni variant identified (TGR_SCHMA_v2)
encode a leader peptide related to, but shorter than, the
mitochondrial one. It is not possible, in silico, to ascribe a
topological signal to this variant. The genomic sequence
and exon-intron structure of Schistosoma TGR genes
strongly support the existence of these variants. Indeed,
the information for the identified Schistosoma leader
peptides is found in an exon upstream of the one encod-

ing the N-terminal sequence of the Grx domain.
TGR_SCHJA_v1 (putatively encoding a mitochondrial
TGR variant) and TGR_SCHJA_v2 (with a shorter leader
peptide) are derived from alternative splicing of exon I
and exon II at a canonical GU donor site present in intron
I and at a leaky GU donor site present in exon I, respectively. If the transcript is spliced at this latter GU donor
site, it would give rise to a shorter exon I and, consequently to a shorter leader peptide (Figure 4c). The same
gene structure is observed in S. mansoni TGR suggesting
that, in addition to TGR_SCHMA_v2, a mitochondrial
variant of TGR (TGR_SCHMA_v1) also exists in this species (Figure 4c). The sequences of the full-length cDNA
variants encoding Schistosoma cytosolic TGRs, and the
structure of the genes suggest that the cytosolic variants
(TGR_SCHJA_v3 and TGR_SCHMA_v3) are derived
from alternative initiation of transcription, from a puta-

tive promoter at intron I, similar to what has been
hypothesized for the E. granulosus variants. Figure 4d
shows a model for the generation of Schistosoma TGR
variants, which takes into account all this information.
In order to confirm the presence of the newly identified
variant in S. mansoni and assess the occurrence of the
putative mitochondrial variant (identified in S. japonicum
ESTs, but not in S. mansoni), we performed PCRs from
different Schistosoma samples (schistosomula, adult
worm and cercariae) with forward primers specific for
each of the leader peptide variants and a common TGR
reverse primer; in addition we used, as a control, a forward primer corresponding to the 5'end of the cytosolic
variant (Figure 5a). PCR products of the expected sizes
were obtained in the three reactions in all materials, confirming the expression of both leader peptide variants,
TGR_SCHMA_v1 and TGR_SCHMA_v2. Figure 5b

shows the result of the PCR reactions using cercariae as a
cDNA template.
Finally, we investigated whether there are additional
variants in E. granulosus or whether the already known
variants are developmentally regulated. To this end, we
performed RT-PCRs using the splice leader exon of E.
granulosus and TGR reverse specific primers on different
E. granulosus materials (larval worms, adult worms and
germinal layer of hydatid cyst). To allow discrimination of
variants that may subtly differ in size, the PCR products
obtained were analyzed on polyacrylamide gels. The
results suggest that no additional variants to the already
described are expressed in E. granulosus and that the

mitochondrial and cytosolic variants are expressed in all
stages analyzed (data not shown).
Analysis of transcription from alternative promoter site

We previously postulated that the mRNA variants
derived from a single TGR gene may arise from two alternative transcription initiation sites located upstream of
the first exon (core promoter) and upstream of the second exon (intron promoter), because: i) both variants
contained the trans-splice leader exon and ii) a putative
TATA box was present within the intron sequence [11].

intron promoter nucleotide sequences of Echinococcus

and Schistosoma TGRs did not evidence significant similarity, although there were some conserved regions at
both presumptive promoter regions (data not shown). We
tested the promoter activity of the putative intron promoter of E. granulosus TGR in a heterologous system
(CHO-K1 cells) using a reporter vector (pAcGFP1-1™,
Clontech), but this approach was not successful. Thus, in
order to obtain evidence of alternative transcription initiation in E granulosus, we performed RT-PCR with forward primers mapping the first intron and a reverse
primer from a downstream exon. This strategy has been
previously used [17] and its rationale relies on the fact
that trans-splicing is, kinetically, a much slower process
than cis-splicing, and thus it is possible to find a population of transcripts not completely processed; these transcripts will have been already cis-spliced, but have not
been yet trans-spliced. The results indicate that alternative transcription initiation takes place from intron 1,
downstream of the TATA box, since a PCR product was
obtained with the forward primer 50 bp downstream of

the putative TATA sequence present in the intron, but
not with primers immediately downstream or upstream
from the TATA sequence. Since TGR mRNAs from Schistosoma TGRs are not trans-spliced [13] this strategy
could not be used to assess alternative initiation of transcription from intron I.

Discussion
Previous studies on thioredoxin and glutathione systems
in parasitic flatworms indicated that these systems are
different to those of their vertebrate hosts [7-9,11]. The
main difference is the absence of conventional GR and TR
in these parasites, and the substitution of both enzymes
by TGR as a sole redox "wire". Our analysis of platyhelminth genomes and transcriptomes indicates that this is the
case for all flatworm parasites for which information is
available. The E. multilocularis genome revealed that this
cestode also lacks conventional TR and GR, and its redox
thiol-disulfide homeostasis relies exclusively on a single
Sec-containing TGR, in agreement with previous bio-

Otero et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:237
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/237

chemical and molecular studies of E. granulosus. A cDNA
encoding TGR was also identified from T. solium, the
other medically important cestode. A similar scenario
was observed in the case of trematodes: lack of conventional GR and TR and presence of TGR in the genomes of
Schistosoma spp. [18,19], and a cDNA encoding TGR
from F. hepatica, an additional member of the class. Thus
the dependence on the single oxidoreductase is common
to the neodermata lineage (a platyhelminth subphylum
that contains the classes Cestoda and Trematoda, but not
the free-living class Turbellaria). Our results further
revealed that the absence of TR and GR is not characteristic of the entire platyhelminth phylum. The turbellarian
S. mediterranea possesses TR, GR and TGR, indicating
that flatworm parasites have lost TR and GR genes. Elimination of GR and TR from their genomes suggests
streamlining of redox regulation.
Another interesting finding in our study is the identification of novel variants of S. mansoni and S. japonicum
TGRs. Previously, cytosolic and mitochondrial variants
derived from a single gene were described in E. granulosus [11]. In the case of Schistosoma, we could detect in silico and confirm experimentally the existence of two
variants in addition to the previously reported cytosolic
form. One of the novel forms encodes a mitochondrial
TGR; and this is in agreement with the occurrence of
cytosolic and mitochondrial thioredoxins in Schistosoma
[18]. The second newly identified TGR variant encodes a
shorter leader peptide. The functional significance of this
leader peptide (e.g. topological localization information
or a regulatory role) must await functional studies. In
many species, distinct genes encode for mitochondrial
and cytosolic TRs. Nevertheless, complex expression patterns and rare mRNA variants have also been observed
for all TR genes in mammals [20-26], and the functional
significance of this complexity is not fully understood. In
this context, it is important to note that the three variants
of S. mansoni TGR and the cytosolic and mitochondrial
variants of E. granulosus are expressed in all the life cycle
stages examined (cercariae, schistosomule and adult
worms in the case of S. mansoni; larval worms, hydatid
cyst wall and adult worms in the case of E. granulosus).
The existence of TGR variants reveals a relatively complex expression of the gene in these organisms that may
be relevant when considering TGR as a drug target; in
particular if inhibition is to be achieved at different subcellular compartments.
The study of the mechanism by which TGR variants
may be generated in parasitic flatworms was addressed by
two different strategies. The initial promoter reporter
strategy was not successful. However, in the case of E.
granulosus it was possible to map the initiation of transcription from the intron promoter, downstream from
the presumptive TATA box. Thus, our results suggest

Page 10 of 13

that two promoters (core and intron promoters) give rise
to two different transcripts. The absence of the splice
leader exon in Schistosoma TGR mRNAs precluded the
use of this strategy. Nevertheless, the information is consistent with the model depicted in Figure 4d. One of the
transcripts would be derived from the core promoter and
would be alternatively spliced, generating the two variants with related but different N-terminal signal peptides,
and an additional variant would be generated from alternative initiation of transcription.

Conclusions
Our study found that the biochemical scenario in parasitic flatworms differs from the one observed in free-living flatworms. A unique and simplified redox system,
termed linked thioredoxin-glutathione system, is present
in all platyhelminth parasites examined. In contrast, conventional and linked thioredoxin and glutathione systems
were found in S. mediterranea, a free-living platyhelminth. The data also show that canonical GR and TR were
specifically lost in the parasitic platyhelminths. Overall,
our results reinforce previous studies indicating that TGR
is an excellent drug target for flatworm infections [14,15];
indeed, maintenance of redox homeostasis and basic cellular processes such as synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides
depend on a single selenoenzyme in different classes of
flatworm parasites. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis of TRs, GRs and TGRs indicates that flatworm TGRs
form a clade with no clear ortholog to either mammalian
TRs or TGR; these differences may be relevant for selective inhibition. The fact that all flatworm TGRs contain
selenocysteine at the active site constitutes a unique
opportunity to target this particularly reactive nucleophilic residue. Alternatively, flatworm parasite redox
homeostasis could be disrupted targeting selenium incorporation, for instance by selectively inhibiting platyhelminth selenophosphate synthetase or SECIS-binding
protein.
Our work also demonstrates the expression of TGR
variants in the human parasites Schistosoma spp. Finally,
we provide evidence that alternative initiation of transcription and transcript processing contribute to the generation of TGR variants in platyhelminth parasites,
revealing plasticity of gene expression in these organisms.

were
searched with tblastn, using the sequences of S. mansoni
and E. granulosus TGRs and human GR, TRs and TGR as
queries. The coding sequence of E. multilocularis TGR
was determined based on the cDNA and amino acid
sequences of E. granulosus TGR previously described in
[11]. To map the coding sequence of S. mediterranea
TGR, TR and GR, the amino acid sequences of E. granulosus and S. mansoni TGRs, human mitochondrial TR
and human GR, were respectively used, as well as available ESTs encoding S. mediterranea TGR, TR and GR,
retrieved from http://smedgd.neuro.utah.edu/. The final
adjustments of intron-exon boundaries were performed
based on a multiple alignment of TRs, GRs and TGRs
from different species. Finally, in order to obtain information on expressed TR, GR and TGR from other platyhelminth organisms, tblastn (EST others option) and blastp
searches were performed at the NCBI server with flatworm and mammalian pyridine-nucleotide thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases as queries.
Sequence and phylogenetic analyses

The selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) elements
present in flatworm TR and TGR genes were identified
using the SECISearch program, version 2-19 http://
genome.unl.edu/SECISearch.html[27] using the default
energy cutoffs in all cases, and the canonical pattern for
all but Schistosoma TGRs; in these latter instances the
non-canonical pattern revealed the SECIS element.
Topology prediction of the polypeptides was carried out
using SignalP 3.0 [23] and ipSORT [28]. Phylogenetic
analyses of flatworm and mammalian GRs, TRs and
TGRs were performed on amino acid sequences aligned
with ClustalW2 [29]. Neighbor-joining, maximum parsimony, minimum evolution and UPMGA methods were
used to reconstruct phylogenies, with MEGA4 [30], and
the following parameters: pairwise deletion, Poisson correction and uniform rates among sites. In all cases bootstrap test was performed on 500 replicates. The analyses
were performed including and excluding the Grx domain
of TGR.
In silico and experimental identification of platyhelminth
TGR variants

To identify platyhelminth TGR variants, tblastn searches
were performed on the blast servers of NCBI (option EST
others) and S. mansoni, E. multilocularis and S. mediterranea genomic databases using the TGR sequences as
queries. Experimental evidence of newly identified S.
mansoni variants was analyzed using forward primers
that allow discrimination of the variants (for details see
Figure 5) used in combination with a TGR gene-specific
reverse primer in PCR reactions from cDNAs of different
S. mansoni materials. Total RNA was isolated from cer-

cariae, 3 hours schistosomula and adult worms using a
modified TRIZOL (Invitrogen)/RNeasy (Qiagen) procedure [31]. Schistosomula were prepared by mechanical
transformation of cercariae as previously described [32].
cDNA was generated from 1 μg of total RNA using
Superscript II (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's
specifications. The S. mansoni life cycle is maintained at
the Schistosoma Research Group at the Pathology
Department, University of Cambridge, UK. In the case of
E. granulosus, experimental identification of additional
TGR variants was examined on different parasite materials (larval worms, adult worms and hydatid cyst wall) by
RT-PCR, using E. granulosus 5' splice-leader exon as forward primer and different gene specific reverse primers
derived from the previously published TGR cDNA
sequence [11]. In all cases RNA was obtained from trizoltreated E. granulosus samples and subsequently used as
template for reverse transcription reactions and PCRs as
previously described [33], using ThermoScript (Invitrogen) reverse transcriptase and Pfu (Fermentas) DNA
polymerase, respectively. In all cases, PCR products were
analyzed by electrophoresis.

Two fragments corresponding to the Grx domain and the
TR domains of the TGR gene were amplified by PCR
from E. granulosus DNA, using forward and reverse
primers derived from E. granulosus TGR cDNA
sequence. The PCR products were cloned in pGEM-T
easy™ (Promega) and subsequently sequenced by primer
walking. The core promoter of TGR gene (1.5 kbp
sequence upstream of TGR coding sequencer) was amplified using a forward primer derived from E. multilocularis homologous region, and a reverse primer derived
from the 5'-end of E. granulosus TGR cDNA sequence;
this PCR product was cloned and sequenced as described
above.
Analysis of alternative initiation of transcription from E.
granulosus TGR gene

In order to investigate and map alternative transcription
initiation, we also performed RT-PCRs from E. granulosus hydatid cyst germinal layer using forward primers
spanning the first intron of E. granulosus TGR (upstream
and downstream of the presumed TATA box present in
intron 1) and a reverse primer corresponding to exon 3
(Figure 6). Control PCRs were carried out from genomic
DNA.

Figure 6 Analysis of alternative initiation of transcription from E. granulosus TGR intron 1. A. The sequence of E. granulosus TGR gene starting
from intron 1 ending at exon 3. Exons 2 and 3 are shaded in grey. The putative TATA box present in intron 1 is highlighted in bold and italics. Sequences
of the primers used in the PCR experiments are shown underlined and in italics: forward primers 1, 2 and 3 span intron 1 from 5' to 3'; the reverse
primer derives from exon 3 sequence. B. Schematic representation of the primers used in PCR reactions, localized in the TGR sequence. C. Gel-electrophoresis of PCR reaction carried out from genomic DNA (lanes 2 to 4) and from E. granulosus cDNA (lanes 5 to 7) using a combination of the reverse
primer and forward primers 1, 2 and 3 (lanes 2 and 5, lanes 3 and 6, lanes 4 and 7, respectively). Lane 1 corresponds to 100 bp plus ladder (Fermentas).

Authors' contributions
LO carried out most of the work described: cloned E. granulosus gene and promoter, performed the experiments using a heterologous system, analyzed the
existence of TGR variants in S. mansoni and E. granulosus cDNAs by PCR,
searched the genomes of E. multilocularis, Schistosoma spp. and S. mediterranea
and analyzed the gene structure of the genes of interest. AVP prepared mRNA
and cDNA from different S. mansoni samples. CF and MB prepared cDNA and
genomic DNA from E. granulosus samples and provided technical help. GS performed in silico data mining of ESTs and genomes, phylogenetics analysis, and
performed the experiments to test alternative transcription from intron promoter by PCR. LO and GS primarily conceived and designed the study, with
insights from CF and VNG. Analyzed all the data: LO, VNG, CF and GS. GS wrote

the manuscript, LO, VNG and CF helped to draft the manuscript. All authors
read, revised and approved the final manuscript.
