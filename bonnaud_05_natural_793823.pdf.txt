Abstract
Background: The human HERV-W multicopy family includes a unique proviral locus, termed
ERVWE1, whose full-length envelope ORF was preserved through evolution by the action of a
selective pressure. The encoded Env protein (Syncytin) is involved in hominoid placental
physiology.
Results: In order to infer the natural history of this domestication process, a comparative genomic
analysis of the human 7q21.2 syntenic regions in eutherians was performed. In primates, this region
was progressively colonized by LTR-elements, leading to two different evolutionary pathways in
Cercopithecidae and Hominidae, a genetic drift versus a domestication, respectively.
Conclusion: The preservation in Hominoids of a genomic structure consisting in the juxtaposition
of a retrotransposon-derived MaLR LTR and the ERVWE1 provirus suggests a functional link
between both elements.

Background
The infectious retrovirus founding the contemporary
HERV-W family [1] entered the genome of a Catarrhine
ancestor 25–40 million years ago [2,3]. The spread of the
HERV-W family into the genome essentially results from
autonomous and non-autonomous events of intracellular
retrotransposition of transcriptionally active copies [4,5].
The HERV-W family contains a unique locus, termed
ERVWE1, which encodes an envelope glycoprotein
expressed in the placenta [3,6]. This envelope, also
dubbed Syncytin, exhibits fusogenic properties in vitro
and is directly involved in trophoblast differentiation [68]. The functional conservation of the ERVWE1 locus
among Hominoids [9] and the identification of selective

constraints on the env gene [10] strongly suggest that this
retroviral locus has been recruited to play a role in placental physiology. In order to decipher the natural history of
the ERVWE1 locus, we performed a comparative genomic
analysis of the eutherian chromosomal regions syntenic
to a portion of human chromosome 7q21.2 containing
the (H)ERVWE1 locus. We observe in this region that the
content in transposable elements varies between species,
notably with a progressive enrichment of LTR-elements in
the Platyrrhine and Catarrhine lineages. Based on an
ancestral mosaic of LTR-elements, this retroviral cluster
followed two opposed evolutionary pathways, a genetic
drift versus a domestication, in Cercopithecidae and Hominidae lineages, respectively.

Results and Discussion
The initial failure to isolate the ERVWE1 integration site in
Old World Monkeys [9] suggested that this region was
shaped by complex recombination events. The comparative analysis of human ERVWE1 flanking sequences with
the mouse genome has revealed two syntenic anchor
points in the ERVWE1 provirus vicinity. Thus, the peroxisome biogenesis factor 1 gene (PEX1) and the ocular
development-associated gene (ODAG) are located
upstream and downstream from ERVWE1, respectively. In
genomic databases, the genetic linkage between both
boundary genes was found in 14 mammals and 2 birds
(Figure 1a). In addition, to fill in the evolutionary gap of
this dataset, we PCR amplified and sequenced the intergenic region of two primates, Macaca mulatta and Ateles
fusciceps robustus.
The length of the PEX1-ODAG intergenic region varies
among species (17.8 ± 7.9 kb), ranging from 2.6 kb to
30.9 kb for rat and human, respectively (Figure 1a). The
length variation of the intergenic region is generally due to
the presence of various transposable elements (TEs) (Figure 1b). The particularly short intergenic regions of
rodents may result from the general deletion mechanisms
previously proposed to account for rodent small genome
size [11]. The herein described region suggests that the
rodent deletion process show no bias towards TEs (Figure
1b). In comparison, the length of PEX1 and ODAG
intronic regions is homogenous (PEX1 : 38.5 ± 13.4 kb ;
ODAG : 8.1 ± 2.5 kb), the variability relying mostly upon
one species for each gene (Figure 1b). For example, the
largest intronic region of PEX1 orthologous gene is
observed in Bos taurus and corresponds to the presence of
about 40 kb of TEs as compared to 10–20 kb in other species (Figure 1b).
TEs contents differ quantitatively and qualitatively
between lineages and between intergenic and intronic
regions (Figure 1b). In introns, SINEs then LINEs represent the majority of TEs among all species. The singular
large LINE content of Bos taurus PEX1 introns is compatible with the huge amount of specific LINE elements in
the genome of this species [12]. The absence of such specific LINE elements in Bos taurus ODAG introns may be
due to the shorter length of this gene. Within the intergenic regions, first LINEs and second SINEs predominate
in Carnivores, Artiodactyls and Rodents. In primates, the
intergenic regions consist largely of LTR elements and
Alus. The LTR-elements are clustered in a 20 kb region just
downstream from the PEX1 gene and the Alu elements are
spread within the 10 kb region upstream from the ODAG
gene. This local LTR concentration in primates is particularly high as compared to previous comparative analysis
over several megabases [12]. The 30 kb human PEX1-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/2/1/57

ODAG intergenic region contains 11%, 2% and 64% of
Alus, LINE-1s and LTR-elements, respectively.
The picture obtained from the comparison of the syntenic
PEX1-ODAG intergenic regions between mammalian species is informative about the putative composition of this
region in common ancestors, depicted at the nodes of the
phylogenic tree (Figure 2). In addition, LTR-element
flanking sequences indicate whether the retrotransposition process was autonomous, i.e. mediated by an HERVspecific reverse transcriptase (RT), or non-autonomous,
i.e. mediated by the LINE RT which contributes to pseudogene formation. The autonomous events leads to the
duplication of a genomic 4–6 bp sequence, flanking consequently the proviral 5' and 3' LTRs. In the case of LINE
RT retrotransposition, a longer flanking repeat of 10–16
bp is observed together with an mRNA typical structure
(absence of promoter element and presence of a 3'
poly(A) tail) [13,14]. By merging all this information, we
infer the natural history of this region.
The first step of the parsimonious scenario consists in the
integration of mammalian apparent LTR-retrotransposon
(MaLR) element in the PEX1-ODAG intergenic region of a
primitive mammalian ancestor, followed by a local
recombination between the 5' and 3' paired LTRs)[15],
generating the MaLR isolated LTR. However, the absence
among species of flanking duplicated sequences as a vestige of the original integration does not support this
hypothesis, although this 100 million years-old signature
may have vanished. In human, only two short 57 bp and
106 bp segments were identified (Figure 3), presenting
75.4 % and 67.9% similarity with MLT1J2 and MLT1J
subfamilies of MaLR elements)[15], respectively. The 260
bp remaining parts of the MaLR LTR exhibits no similarity
with previously defined MaLR consensus sequences, suggesting the identification of a new MaLR subfamily named
MaLR-e1. In addition, similarity search (threshold 60%)
of MaLR-e1 human and dog sequences on their respective
genomes indicate only one other full-length element and
a vast majority of elements consisting roughly in either
the 5' or the 3' half part of MaLR-e1. The location of one
end of these MaLR partial sequences within a 40 bp region
(Figure 3) bordered on each side by the MLT1J and
MLT1J2 identified regions suggests an authentic chimerical origin for this MaLR-e1 LTR. The paucity of the MaLRs
bipartition reflect an unsuccessful propagation of this
form. Strikingly, the deduced junction area of both parts
of the chimera corresponds to a functional sequence consisting of a trophoblast specific enhancer (TSE) [16].
Second, a 633 bp ERV-P element was acquired by the
common ancestor of the Platyrrhines and Catarrhines
more than 40 million years ago [17]. As for the MaLR-e1
element, the absence of trivial duplication of the

ERV-H Platyrrhini and Catarrhini lineage specific proviruses are labeled H(p) and H(c), respectively. env smaller boxes refer to
the ERVWE1 env gene. Proposed ancestral chromosomal structure are drawn in grey cartouches. The cross-box within the

integration site shades the origin of the contemporary isolated ERV-P LTRs. In any case, the putative primary recombination between paired LTRs may have occurred rapidly
after integration as no ERV-P internal sequence can be
detected in any of the studied species. The LTR sequence is
complete as referred to the consensus sequence)[18],
although the 5' first ten nucleotides largely diverged.

specific reverse transcriptases. The accumulation of independent substitutions in 5' and 3' paired LTRs, identical
when the provirus integrated, is informative about the
chronology of these events. Thus, the comparison of
paired LTRs distances between the ERV-H(c) and the
ERVWE1 proviruses (0.84 and 0.65, respectively) suggests
that ERV-H(c) integrated earlier than ERVWE1.

Third, ERV-H and ERV-W proviruses integrated in the
germ line of a Catarrhine ancestor, within the ERV-P and
MaLR-e1 LTRs, respectively. Note that an ERV-H sequence
is identified in the Platyrrhines (ERV-H(p)), distinct from
the Catarrhines ERV-H provirus (ERV-H(c)) described
above, as located about 2 kb upstream from the ERV-P
LTR. The ERV-W element corresponds to the ERVWE1 provirus as it contains the locus-specific signature (a 12 bp
deletion in the 3' end of the env gene) previously identified by comparing (H)ERVWE1 and paralogous HERV-W
copies [10]. The presence in several species of degenerated
direct repeat at both ends of ERV-H(c) [A(C/T)(G/A)AC]
and ERVWE1 [CA(A/G)(C/T)] proviruses attests that retrovirus-like integration events occurred. Whether these
proviral insertions derived from re-infection or cis- or
trans-retrotransposition processes remains unknown.
Nevertheless, the duplication of the integration site indicates the existence at that time of functional H- and W-

Then the Catarrhine ancestor genomic structure followed
two divergent evolutionary pathways in Cercopitheques
and Hominoids (Figure 2). An about 9 kb fragment was
deleted in the Cercopitheque lineage, consisting of a 3.8
kb pol-env-LTR ERV-H(c) sequence, a 4.3 kb LTR-gag-pol
ERVWE1 sequence and the 0.9 kb inter-proviral region.
This large deletion produced an hybrid ERV-(H/W) defective proviral structure. Surprisingly, as both ERV-H(c) 5'
and ERVWE1 3' flanking sequences were also deleted, the
Cercopitheque lineage is devoid of MaLR-e1 and ERV-P
LTRs elements. This global inactivation of all four LTR elements was followed by the genetic drift of the env gene as
revealed by the presence of different inactivating substitutions in the baboon and macaque ERVWE1 remnants, a
stop codon in position 181 and a frameshift in position
498, respectively. In Hominoids, the overall 30 kb structure was preserved as confirmed by overlapping LD-PCR
amplification of gorilla, orangutan and gibbon genomic

Alignments of orthologous and paralogous MaLR-e1 LTR sequences from mammalian species
Alignments of orthologous and paralogous MaLR-e1 LTR sequences from mammalian species. Sequences were
assembled using the human sequence (HOM) as reference. Orthologous sequences are from the following origin: HOM: Homo
sapiens, PAN: Pan troglodytes, GOR: Gorilla gorilla, ORA:Pongo pygmaeus, GIB: Hylobatides pileatus, ATE: Ateles fusciceps
robustus, CAL: Callithrix jacchus, OTO: Otolemur garnetti, CAN: Canis familiaris, DAS: Dasypus novemcictus. Hs12, hs5 and
hs20 correspond to MaLR-e1 putative paralogous sequences isolated in the human genome. 5' and 3' openboxes corresponds
to MLT1J2 and MLT1J Repbase consensuses, respectively. The region with grey background indicates the 5' or 3' boundaries

DNA (data not shown). In Hominoids, the ERV-H(c) element contains a locus specific signature that consists in a
unique pol-env junction. An accurate dating of this deletion event would require an extended panel of species as
the region of interest is absent from the Macaca mulatta
and Papio anubis genomes. The presence of the env 12 bp
deletion (crucial for the Env fusogenic activity) in Hominoids [10] and Cercopitheques ERVWE1 proviruses suggests that this deletion occurred originally in a primary
Catarrhine ancestor possibly soon after integration, in the
youth of the ERV-W family. Furthermore, the ERVWE1 env
signature was found to be unique in human and chimpanzee genomes, what shows an absence of retrotransposition of this element. This suggests an absence of
expression of the ERVWE1 locus in the Hominoid germ
line, as opposed to many other HERV-W loci that were
shown to retrotransposed using mainly LINE-RT [5].
ERVWE1 was shown to be a bona fide gene involved in
hominoid placental physiology [9]. The concomitant conservation in Hominoids of the surrounding LTR elements
suggests that they were either required for ERVWE1 activity or hitchhiked during the purifying ERVWE1 selection
process [10]. The substitution profile along the whole
region does not rule out any hypotheses. Nevertheless, it
reveals the strict identity of the MaLR-e1 portion located
upstream from ERVWE1 in human, chimpanzee and
gorilla, as opposed to a MaLR-e1 3' part different for each
species. The regulation of the expression of ERVWE1 env
was shown to be a bipartite element [16] composed of (i)
a cyclic AMP (cAMP)-inducible retroviral promoter, the
ERVWE1 5' LTR, and (ii) a 436 bp upstream regulatory
element (URE), encompassing the MaLR-e1 5' part, that
contains the trophoblast specific enhancer (TSE) cited
above, conferring high level of expression and placental
tropism [16]. Although efficient, the cooperation between
the URE and the LTR seemed complex due to an interference phenomenon, probably resulting from the presence
of AP-2 and Sp-1 binding sites on the TSE and the cAMPresponsive elements of the LTR [16]. Interestingly, the gibbon transcriptional regulatory elements shows an in vitro
biased behavior as compared to human, chimpanzee,
gorilla and orangutan orthologous elements, i.e. the
ERVWE1 5' LTR exhibits a higher placental promoter
activity [9] and the URE is deficient in enhancer activity
[16]. This feature of the gibbon URE seems associated
with two specific mutations in AP-2 and Sp-1, an
enhancer activity equivalent to the human one being
restored after the modification of the two corresponding
residues [16]. Although we cannot exclude the possibility
that these observations are partially due to the specific
context of a human trophoblastic cell line, this functional
analysis supports the very recent recruitment of the elderly
MaLR-e1 5' half as proposed in this work. Thus, a LTR of
retrotransposon MaLR element and a LTR of a (H)ERV-W

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/2/1/57

proviral locus were co-opted to regulate syncytin expression in placenta. Interestingly, the newly identified
murine syncytin-B env gene which triggers cell-cell fusion
in vitro and is expressed specifically in placenta in vivo displays an upstream MaLR LTR [19]. Whether this represents an additional element to the puzzling convergent
physiological role of primate and rodent syncytins
remains to be determined.

Conclusion
We observe in the region syntenic to a portion of human
chromosome 7q21.2 containing the (H)ERVWE1 locus a
progressive enrichment of LTR-elements in the Platyrrhine and Catarrhine lineages. Based on an ancestral
mosaic of LTR-elements, two opposed evolutionary pathways are followed, a genetic drift versus a domestication,
in Cercopithecidae and Hominidae lineages, respectively.
The domestication process includes the ERVWE1 locus in
Hominoid species, and putatively a retrotransposonderived MaLR LTR strictly conserved in the Homo/Pan/
Gorilla subgroup. We propose that both elements were
recruited to achieve the regulation of syncytin expression
in placenta.
