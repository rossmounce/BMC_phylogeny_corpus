Abstract
Background: Propionibacterium acnes is a commensal of human skin but is also known to be
involved in certain diseases, such as acne vulgaris and infections of orthopaedic implants. Treatment
of these conditions is complicated by increased resistance to antibiotics and/or biofilm formation
of P. acnes bacteria. P. acnes can be infected by bacteriophages, but until recently little has been
known about these viruses. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize inducible phages
from P. acnes on a genetic and morphological basis.
Results: More than 70% (65/92) of P. acnes isolates investigated have inducible phages, classified
morphologically as Siphoviruses. The phages have a head of 55 nm in diameter and a tail of 145–
155 nm in length and 9–10 nm in width. There was no difference in carriage rate of phages between
P. acnes isolates from deep infections and isolates from skin. However, there was a significant lower
carriage rate of phages in P. acnes biotype IB, mostly attributed to the low carriage rate of inducible
phages in biotype IB isolated from deep tissue. Most phages have a strong lytic activity against all P.
acnes isolates with inducible phages, but have less lytic activity against isolates that have no
prophages. Phages only infected and lysed P. acnes and not other closely related propionibacteria.
All phages could infect and lyse their non-induced parental host, indicating that these prophages do
not confer superinfection immunity. The phages have identical protein pattern as observed on SDSPAGE. Finally, sequencing of two phage genes encoding a putative major head protein and an
amidase and showed that the phages could be divided into different groups on a genetic basis.
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that temperate phages are common in P. acnes, and that they
are a genetically and functionally homogeneous group of Siphoviruses. The phages are specific for
P. acnes and do not seem to confer superinfection immunity.

Background
Propionibacterium acnes is regarded as a commensal of
human skin, but is also known to be involved in different
infections such as acne vulgaris [1] and infections with

orthopaedic implants [2,3]. Treatment of acne vulgaris is
complicated by bacterial resistance to commonly used
antibiotics [4-6]. P. acnes infections of joint prostheses are
probably much more common than previously thought

[7], and treatment is complicated by biofilm formation
on the foreign material [8]. The complete genome of a P.
acnes isolate was recently sequenced by Brüggemann et al
2004 [9], showing that P. acnes possesses several putative
virulence genes including hemolysins and co-hemolysins
(CAMP factors) [10-12]. The sequenced genome only contains one cryptic prophage, and in general there is limited
knowledge about phages from P. acnes.
Bacteriophages can enter two principally different life
cycles, lytic or lysogenic. In the lytic life cycle a bacteriophage attaches to the bacterial cell and injects its genetic
material. This genetic material is directly replicated, early
and late phage genes are transcribed, proteins are translated, new phage particles are formed, and the bacterium
is ultimately lysed to release the progeny. In the lysogenic
life cycle, most known phages integrate their genome into
the host genome by specific attachment and recombination events. There have been reports about phages existing
as extrachromosomal circular or linear plasmid
prophages, as a part of their lysogenic cycle [13-15]. These
so called prophages become integrated parts of the
genome and are replicated together with the bacterial
genome during cell division. Prophages account for much
of the genetic diversity seen in bacteria and often carry
genes that are beneficial for the bacteria, including toxins
and other virulence factors [16-19].
Almost 30 years ago, it was reported that 18% of P. acnes
isolates are carriers of bacteriophages [20], but little is
known about these phages and their potential impact on
virulence. Studies of P. acnes phages have been undertaken to establish a phage typing system to distinguish
between different types of P. acnes [21,22] as an alternative to use fermentative and serological methods [23].
Many studies on phages have been done on other propionibacteria as Propionibacterium freudenreichii mainly due
to the research impact for dairy industry [24-28].
Recently Farrar et al sequenced the first genome of a P.
acnes lytic phage [29]. The phage was classified as a Siphovirus with a genome of 29,739 bp encoding 48 putative
genes. Characterization of phages from P. acnes gives a
deeper understanding of the relationship between phages
and bacteria, and may eventually lead to a new therapy to
treat P. acnes infections. In this study, we have induced,
isolated, and characterized 65 temperate bacteriophages
from different P. acnes isolates. The phages are all classified as Siphoviruses and can be divided into different
groups based on dissimilarities in two genes encoding a
putative major head protein and an amidase.

Results
Carriage of phages
Since not much is known about the presence and carriage
rate of bacteriophages in P. acnes, we investigated this in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/139

relation to both the site of isolation (superficial or deep
infections) and to biotype. To investigate if P. acnes had
prophages that could be induced to enter the lytic life
cycle, we stimulated 92 different P. acnes isolates (see
table 1) with 2 μg/ml mitomycin C to induce prophages,
followed by analysis of the plaque forming capacity of
lysates on the noninduced parental isolates. Plaques were
clear with well-defined edges and had a diameter of 6–7
mm. Bacteriophages could be induced in more than 70%
of the isolates examined. In this study, we have used different isolates of P. acnes (Holmberg et al, unpublished)
from deep tissue (AD-isolates, mainly isolated from infections of foreign material as hip prosthesis and sternal
wires), and from the skin (AS-isolates, from the skin of
healthy individuals). AD-isolates and AS-isolates had a
carriage-rate of 70.5% respectively 70.8% (see Figure 1A).
Bacterial isolates that did not have any inducible phages
using mitomycin C were screened for prophages using a
PCR-based approach by amplification of the gene encoding a putative major head protein and recA as a positive
control. Only one of the isolates, AS14, was positive in the
major head PCR, indicating that only 1/9 of these isolates
has phages with similarities to the known major head
gene (data not shown).
The carriage rate of inducible temperate phages in the different biotypes was also examined. Biotypes had previously been determined by sequencing of recA (Holmberg
et al, unpublished). Biotype IA had a higher carriage rate
than IB (p < 0.01), as did biotype II (p < 0.05). Since biotype IB had a lower carriage rate compared to the other
two biotypes, we compared the carriage rate of phages in
the isolates determined as biotype IB between deep and
superficial isolates of P. acnes. The carriage rate in biotype
IB was significantly higher in superficial isolates as compared with isolates from deep infections, since none of the
deep tissue isolates biotyped as IB had inducible phages
(p < 0.05, see Figure 1B).
Bacteriophage morphology and classification
The classification of bacteriophages is mainly based on
phage morphology and the nature of the nucleic acid [30].
Though other classification systems such as sequence similarities within genes encoding structural proteins have
been proposed, classification based on morphology and
the nature of the nucleic acid is still the most accepted system [31]. Forty-nine of the bacteriophages were examined
using negative staining and transmission electron microscopy. All examined phages have an icosahedral head of
approximately 55 nm in diameter, and a tail composed of
33 segments with a total length of 145–155 nm and a
width of 9–10 nm. The tail is non-contractile and appears
flexible. Most phages have a visible base plate on the tail
with attached spikes (see Figure 2, 3). These morphological attributes warrant classification of the phages as SiphoPage 2 of 10

viridae. Thus, this morphology is identical to PA6 [29] and
very similar to the P. acnes phages studied by Zierdt [32].
Also, the phages are very similar morphologically to
Siphoviruses isolated from other propionibacteria
[24,25,27]. This classification was further strengthen by
amino acid sequence comparison of a part of a putative
major head protein with other known phage proteins,
using a BLASTp search against GenBank. The best hit was
on gp6 from PA6, and the second and third best hit on
gp7 from Mycobacterium phage Che9d and gp7 from Mycobacterium phage Halo. All these phages are classified as
Siphoviridae.
Phage specificity
Bacteriophages are generally quite restricted in their host
range. There are phages that can infect over bacterial species boundaries, but some phages are species specific and
in many cases also specific for certain subgroups (subspecies, serotypes or biotypes, strains) within a species. To
determine how specific the isolated phages are, different
P. acnes isolates were infected with 48 different phages
(see additional file 1). Bacterial isolates with inducible
phages were generally easy to lyse, with plaque production in nearly 99% (2278/2304) of cases. P. acnes isolate
AS12 was significantly more difficult to lyse than other
isolates with inducible phages, and only 73% (35/48) of
the examined phages caused plaque formation. Similarly,
phage PAD8 failed to lyse 19% (9/48) of the examined
isolates. In P. acnes isolates without any inducible phages,
we could only observe plaque formation in 30% (144/
480) of the cases. We also examined the ability of phages
to cause lysis in the recently sequenced P. acnes strain
KPA171202 (DSM no. 16379) of biotype IB [9]. This
strain was lysed only by 40% (19/48) of the phage lysates.
The different phages are not specific to certain biotypes,
but seem to be less lytic against biotype II in isolates with
inducible phages, since 23/26 failures to infect and lyse
the bacterial isolates were in isolates of biotype II.

Since all of the examined phages have identical morphology, protein pattern and in most cases very high similarity
in genes encoding the putative major head protein and an
amidase (see Figure 4), we examined if phage host-range
could be used as a possible tool to differentiate the
phages. Based on the host-range analysis we choose P.
acnes isolates KPA171202, AD7, AS1 and AS5 to differentiate the phages and to divide them into different groups.
By using these four isolates, we could divide the phages
into 9 separate groups (see Fig 5). Sixteen of the examined
phages could infect and lyse all four bacterial isolates
(host-range group PA I). There is a tendency that phages
isolated from biotype II and from skin can infect and lyse
all four bacterial isolates, and are classified as host-range
group PA I. Also, the only phages that can lyse the
prophage-free isolates AD26 and AD27 (PAD21, PAS7

and PAS11) are classified as belonging to the host-range
group PA I. Furthermore, none of nine selected phages
(PAS2, PAS10, PAS12, PAS40, PAS50, PAD9, PAD20,
PAD21 and PAD42) were able to infect and lyse P. avidum,
P. granulosum or P. freudenreichii (data not shown). Our
results show that isolates lacking inducible temperate
phages are more difficult to lyse using phages, than isolates carrying inducible temperate phages and that the
phages are specific to P. acnes.
Phylogenetic analysis of phage genes and proteins
A part of a putative major head gene was sequenced in all
isolated phages. The nucleotide sequence was aligned and
a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed. The phages could
be divided in two distinctly divided groups with the
already sequenced phage PA6 forming a third group (see
additional file 2). The whole gene encoding a putative
major head protein was sequenced in nine of these
phages, selected based on their partial sequencing and site
of isolation (AD/AS), and the amino acid sequences were
aligned and a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed (see

similar sequences, even though PAD20 is slightly different. Phages PAS2 and PAS50 form a third group and
PAD21 forms a fourth separated group. This pattern is
similar to the pattern seen when only using partial
sequencing, except that PAD21 now seems to form its
own group.
We further sequenced the gene encoding a putative amidase in these nine phages (see Figure 4C). The phage pattern is similar to what could be seen when aligning the
major head protein. However, PA6 is more closely related
to PAS2 and PAS50 in this protein, and PAD21 do not
form its own group, but have high similarity to the large
group of phages. The closest phage similarity is to Mycobacterium phage PG1 gp49, but more closely related is a
chromosomally encoded P. acnes amidase.

Discussion
We show that more than 70% of the investigated P. acnes
isolates are carriers of inducible phages, which is a significantly higher carriage rate of inducible phages than that

reported by Webster et al (18%) [20] despite that similar
methods were used and isolates were from both skin and
deeper infections. This is most likely due to differences in
the geographic origin of isolates, and may reflect a difference in P. acnes susceptibility to mitomycin C or strain
acquired resistance to phages. There was no overall difference in carriage rate of inducible phages between P. acnes
isolated from skin or deep infections, indicating that carriage of phage not necessary leads to an increased virulence of the host strain. Thus it appears that the phages
studied here do not carry virulence factors, which is in
concordance with the lack of putative virulence factors on
the recently published genome of a P. acnes phage [29]. It
should be noted that at present, we only have information
on the presence or absence of inducible phages. However,
future studies may very well reveal differences in the gene
composition of phages isolated from skin and deep isolates.

We found that isolates of biotype IB have significantly
lower rate of inducible phages as compared to isolates of
IA and II. Interestingly, none of the isolates of biotype IB
in isolates from deep infections are carriers of inducible
phages (0/7), while isolates from skin of biotype IB have
a carriage rate of almost 73%. The low carriage rate of
inducible phages in AD-isolates typed as IB is further
strengthen by the fact that none of these isolates have similarities to the phage major head gene as judged by failure
of amplifying this gene in these isolates (data not shown),
thus indicating that these isolates do not have any inducible phages and not any prophages with similarities to
known P. acnes phages. Thereby it seems like either only
biotype IB without phages can cause infections, or that
biotype IB loses their phages during infection. If this is the
case, it is uncertain why this only happens in biotype IB
and not in biotype IA and II. The lower carriage rate in
biotype IB is neither due to an increased resistance to
phage entrance into the bacterial cell, since biotype IB is
equally sensitive to phages as the other biotypes, as judged
by additional file 1. More research in this specific area is
needed to understand this phenomenon.
When we examined the host isolate specificity of the
phages, we found that isolate AS12 was significantly more
difficult to lyse than the other isolates with inducible
phages. However, AS12 is still highly susceptible to

tree mode. The putative major head protein (A) was similar
between all P. acnes phages examined and showed the highest
similarity to Mycobacterium phage Che9d gp7, but did also
have high similarity to Lactococcus phage phiLC3 MHP and
Streptococcus phage SM1 gp40. If outgroups were removed

observed. One group with PA6, another with PAS2 and
PAS50, a third group with PAD21 and a forth group with
PAS10, PAS12, PAS40, PAD9, PAD20 and PAD42. The putative amidase (C) showed similar patterning among the phages
with phages PAS2 and PAS50 representing one group closely
related to PA6, while the other phages PAS10, PAS12,
PAS40, PAD9, PAD20, PAD21 and PAD42 formed a second
group. The closest known phage protein with similarity to
the putative amidase is represented by Mycobacterium phage
PG1 gp49, but more related is P. acnes own amidase.

PAS12, indicating that AS12 might differ in a protein or
receptor essential for most phages to be able to infect and
lyse the bacterial cell. Opposite to this, we found that
phage PAD8 did not lyse other isolates as efficiently as
other phages. This difference could be caused by the
phage favouring a lysogenic state, or that the phage receptor binding to the bacterial cell is less efficient compared
to other P. acnes phages. When we added phages to P.
acnes isolates without inducible phages, we found that
most of these isolates were resistant to phage-mediated
lysis. This is not surprising, since these isolates do not
have inducible phages and thereby could have a mechanism that makes them resistant against phage infection.
The different phages were not specific to certain biotypes.
However, most of the failures to infect and cause lysis in
the bacterial isolates were in biotype II, possibly indicating that these isolates generally are more resistant to
phages, or adapt more easily to them. Grouping of the
phages based on host-range did not correlate with biotype, even though there is a tendency that phages from
isolates of biotype II are classified as host-range group PA
I, thus indicating that phages from isolates of biotype II
may have broader infective capacity as compared to biotype IA and IB. The phages also seem to be specific to P.
acnes isolates, since none of the examined phages were
able to infect and lyse P. avidum, P. granulosum or P. freudenreichii. All phages examined were able to infect and
lyse their non-induced parental host, thus indicating that
the prophages do not confer superinfection immunity as
many other known prophages do [33,34]. This is in concordance with the fully sequenced phage PA6 that does
not seem to have a repressor-like protein [29]. This may
benefit P. acnes phage evolution by more efficient gene
transfer between prophages and free phages.
The phages examined could be divided into three-four
groups using phylogenetic analysis of the gene encoding a
putative major head protein and an amidase. This differences in sequence stress the fact that the phages in the different groups very well may have other genetic
dissimilarities, providing advantages for the phages. It is
also obvious that several phages have identical nucleotide
sequences and perhaps should be considered as subspecies to certain groups of P. acnes phages. The changes in
the gene encoding the major head do not lead to a
changed morphology, as seen when comparing PAS50
with the other phage micrographs (see Figure 3). When
examining the phage proteins on an SDS-PAGE, all
phages have identical protein patterns with four protein
bands (17 kDa, 29 kDa, 52 kDa and 54 kDa, data not
shown). This indicates that the phages have very similar
structural proteins, even though some substitution in
amino acids occur, and may reflect an evolutionary pressure to retain the structural proteins.

Conclusion
We have induced, identified, and characterized 65 temperate P. acnes phages, classified as Siphoviruses on a morphological basis. These phages are species specific and do
not confer superinfection immunity. These results give
new insight into the relation between P. acnes and its
phages, and contribute to a better understanding of the
phage-host interaction.

Methods
Bacterial isolates
A total of 92 P. acnes isolates were used. These were
divided into two groups: 44 isolates from deep infections
(AD-isolates, mainly isolated from prosthesis and sternal
wires) and 48 isolates from skin from healthy individuals
(AS-strain), described in Holmberg et al, unpublished. All
isolates from healthy individuals and AD-isolates 1–16
and 37 are isolated in Lund, Sweden. AD-isolates 17–32
and 38–48 are isolated in Örebro, Sweden, and AD-isolate
33–36 are isolated in Malmö, Sweden. The P. acnes strain
KPA171202 (DSM no. 16379), P. avidum (DSM no.
4901), P. granulosum (DSM no. 20458) and P. freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii (DSM no. 20271) were obtained
from DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen
und Zellkulturen GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany).
Isolation of phages
P. acnes isolates were plated from frozen stocks on Tryptic
Soy Broth (TSB, Bacto, Mt Pritchard, NSW, Australia) with
1.5% Agar (TSBA, Bacto), and incubated for two days at
37°C under anaerobic conditions. Isolates were inoculated in 10 ml prereduced TSB (rTSB) followed by incubation for three days. TSB was prereduced by 24 h
incubation under anaerobic conditions. The cultures were
diluted 1:9 in 1 ml rTSB and incubation continued for 8
h. Mitomycin C (Calbiochem EMD Biosciences, San
Diego, CA, USA) was added to a final concentration of 2
μg/ml, and incubation continued overnight. Cultures
were centrifugated (10 min, 1,500 g, Eppendorf Centrifuge 5415R) and sterile filtered (Millex-GP 33 mm 0.2
μm, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) to obtain a phage
stock. The phage stock was stored at 4°C for 7 days to clear
the stock from unstable phages [32]. Phages were spotted
onto TSBA plates at different concentrations (1:1 –
1:10,000) after a bacterial overlay of the host P. acnes isolate had been prepared. Plates were incubated for two
days at 37°C under anaerobic conditions and examined
for plaques. When single plaques were observed, these
were picked with a sterile scalpel and transferred to SMbuffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 60 mM
MgSO4(7H2O), 0.01% gelatine) followed by elution overnight at 4°C. Phages were propagated by spotting phages
on a TSBA plate with a bacterial overlay of its host P. acnes
isolate and incubated three days at 37°C under anaerobic
conditions. The overlay containing all plaques were trans-

ferred to SM-buffer, eluted overnight at 4°C, followed by
sterile filtration of the SM-buffer. This method generally
generated a concentration of 1011–1013 pfu/ml. Phages
were named after the host bacterium with a 'P' before the
bacterial isolate name. Isolates were regarded as having
inducible phages if infectious phages were induced using
the method described above. All bacterial isolates that did
not have any inducible phages were screened for
prophages using a PCR-based amplification of the major
head gene (primer pair MHF/MHR) and using recA amplification as a positive control.
Phage host specificity
Forty-eight P. acnes isolates that carried inducible phages
and 10 P. acnes isolates that did not carry any inducible
phages using mitomycin C were plated on TSBA as an
overlay assay. To each plate, 5 μl phage stock (1010 pfu/
ml) from 48 different phages was added. Plates were incubated for 2 days under anaerobic conditions and examined for plaques. Nine phages (PAS2, PAS10, PAS12,
PAS40, PAS50, PAD9, PAD20, PAD21 and PAD42) were
also applied to P. avidum, P, granulosum and P. freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii as an overlay assay.
Electron microscopy
Bacteriophages in a stock concentration of 1011–1013 pfu/
ml were placed on a carbon coated copper grid and negatively stained (for references see [35]). A 0.75% uranyl formate solution was obtained by dissolving 37.5 mg uranyl
formate (BDH Chemicals Ltd., Poole, UK) in 5 ml boiling
water, and stabilized with 5 μl 5 M NaOH. Grids were
rinsed for 45 sec with 100 μl TBS and blotted off with a filter paper. The sample (5 μl) was added to the grid, left for
45 sec and blotted off with a filter paper. The sample was
washed twice with two 100 μl H2O drops and blotted off
after each wash with a filter paper. The sample was stained
for 3 sec with 100 μl 0.75% uranyl formate and then
stained for additionally 15–20 sec with 100 μl 0.75% uranyl formate. Samples were observed using a Jeol JEM 1230
transmission electron microscope operated at 60 kV accel-

erating voltage, and recorded with a Gatan Multiscan 791
CCD camera.
Phage gene comparison
Phage lysate (10 μl) was boiled for 10 min to release
phage DNA from intact phages. A PCR (Eppendorf Mastercycler personal) was run under the following conditions: 95°C 10 min, 35 cycles of 95°C 1 min, annealing
temperature 1 min 30 sec and 72°C 1 min 30 sec, ending
with 72°C for 10 min. Final concentration in the mixture
was 1× buffer, 0.2 mM dNTP mix, 30 mU/μl Taq polymerase, 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 1 μM each of the primers. Primers
used are described in table 2. All samples were run with an
annealing temperature of 56.5°C except when using
primer pairs PR264/PAR-2 and MHF/MHR where an
annealing temperature of 54°C was used. All reagents
except for the primers are from Fermentas (Vilnius,
Lithuania). PCR products were washed with SpinPrep
PCR Clean-up Kit (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA),
sequenced using BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and
analyzed using an ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequences were
aligned using the Clustal W algorithm [36] and a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the MacVector v9.5.2
software package (Cary, NC, USA). The final partial major
head gene nucleotide sequences correspond to nucleotides 163–484 in gp6 from P. acnes bacteriophage PA6.
The phylogenetic tree was constructed using UPGMA [37]
and uncorrected p-values with a bootstrap with 1000 replications. Phylogenetic trees including outgroups with
protein comparisons of a putative major head and an amidase were constructed using neighbor joining and poisson-correction with a best tree mode, while phylogenetic
trees without outgroups were analysed using uncorrected
p-values.
Statistical methods
All statistical tests were calculated using the Chi-Square
test. All tests were also run with Fischer's exact test with
similar results.
Nucleotide sequence accession number
All partial sequences of the gene encoding a putative
major head were submitted to GenBank. Accession numbers (EU302607–EU302671) are shown in table 1. Whole
sequences of the gene encoding a putative major head for
phages PAS2, PAS10, PAS12, PAS40, PAS50, PAD9,
PAD20, PAD21 and PAD42 have accession numbers
EU784673–EU784681 and the gene encoding a putative
amidase have accession numbers EU784682–EU784690.

Host range analysis. Propionibacterium acnes isolates were plated on
TSBA as an overlay assay. Phages isolated from these strains were added
to each P. acnes isolate and incubated for two days at anaerobic conditions and were analyzed for plaques. A plus (+) indicates that the bacterial
isolate was lysed, and the number of + indicates the quality and extent of
the lysis in the bacteria. A minus (-) indicates that no plaques were
observed. P. acnes strain KPA171202 is the recently sequenced P. acnes
strain. Bacterial isolates AD2-AS52 have inducible phages while bacterial
isolates AD1-KPA171202 do not have inducible phages.
