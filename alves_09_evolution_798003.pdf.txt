Abstract
Background: Protein domains represent the basic units in the evolution of proteins. Domain
duplication and shuffling by recombination and fusion, followed by divergence are the most
common mechanisms in this process. Such domain fusion and recombination events are predicted
to occur only once for a given multidomain architecture. However, other scenarios may be
relevant in the evolution of specific proteins, such as convergent evolution of multidomain
architectures. With this in mind, we study glutaredoxin (GRX) domains, because these domains of
approximately one hundred amino acids are widespread in archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes and
participate in fusion proteins. GRXs are responsible for the reduction of protein disulfides or
glutathione-protein mixed disulfides and are involved in cellular redox regulation, although their
specific roles and targets are often unclear.
Results: In this work we analyze the distribution and evolution of GRX proteins in archaea,
bacteria and eukaryotes. We study over one thousand GRX proteins, each containing at least one
GRX domain, from hundreds of different organisms and trace the origin and evolution of the GRX
domain within the tree of life.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that single domain GRX proteins of the CGFS and CPYC classes
have, each, evolved through duplication and divergence from one initial gene that was present in
the last common ancestor of all organisms. Remarkably, we identify a case of convergent evolution
in domain architecture that involves the GRX domain. Two independent recombination events of
a TRX domain to a GRX domain are likely to have occurred, which is an exception to the dominant
mechanism of domain architecture evolution.

Background
Domain duplication and shuffling by recombination and
fusion, followed by divergence are the more frequent
mechanisms for the evolution of proteins [1]. It has been
estimated that such recombination and fusion events are
likely to occur only once for a given multidomain architecture and that, after such an event, the fusion protein is

duplicated and/or diverges over time [1]. In addition, statistical analysis of known multidomain proteins has
shown that a) there is a strong bias for individual domains
involved in recombination and fusion events to be short
[2], and b) some specific sets of recombined domains
(supra domains) participate in further recombination and
fusion events [3]. This provides a model for the dominant

mode of domain architecture evolution in proteins that is
very much consensual. Recent work has further estimated
that between 88% and 95% of all multidomain architectures have evolved through such mechanisms [4-6]. The
remaining architectures are likely to have evolved through
convergent evolution [6]. A recent theory proposes that,
during major evolutionary transitions, evolution is biphasic, further complicating the model of protein evolution
[7]. According to this view, in an initial post-transition
phase, large scale horizontal gene transfer (HGT) would
occur. This would be followed by a second phase where
the more common mechanisms for protein evolution
become dominant. Given this background, it is of interest
to analyze the evolution of a specific type of protein
domain in order to assess the importance of the evolutionary mechanisms described above in the evolution of
that domain.
A protein domain of small size that is known to participate in the architecture of multidomain proteins and is
widespread over the many branches of the evolutionary
tree would be an appropriate choice to study. The glutaredoxin (GRX) domain meets all these conditions. It has
approximately one hundred amino acids, it is a part of
several multidomain architectures and it is present in
archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes. GRXs are thiol oxidoreductases responsible for the reduction of protein
disulfides or glutathione-protein mixed disulfides, which
employ reduced glutathione (GSH) as hydrogen donor
[8]. Together with thioredoxins (TRXs) and other proteins, GRXs are grouped in the thioredoxin fold superfamily, because they share a common structural fold
consisting of a four or five-stranded β-sheet flanked by
several α-helices on either side of the β-sheet [9]. Functionally, TRXs are also disulfide oxireductases. In contrast
with GRXs, oxidized TRXs are reduced by thioredoxins
reductases at the expense of NADPH [8]. Alternatively, in
plant chloroplasts, TRXs are reduced directly by the ferredoxin/ferredoxin reductase system that is coupled to photosynthesis [10]. Three GRX families have been defined
based on the sequence of the putative active sites. Classical dithiol GRXs (CPYC class) with a C [P/S] [Y/F]C active
site sequence are widespread in archaea, bacteria and
eukaryotes. On the other hand, monothiol GRXs (CGFS
class) contain a CGFS-like active site sequence, and they
have currently been reported to exist in bacteria and
eukaryotes [11]. Finally, land plants contain (in addition
to GRXs species of the above classes) a third class of GRXs
(CCMC class), with the sequence CC [M/L] [C/S] in the
putative active sites [12,13]. This division in three groups
is further complicated by the recent characterization in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae of three GRXs (Grx6, Grx7 and
Grx8) with CSYS, CPYS and CPDC active site motifs [1416].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/66

Multidomain proteins that contain GRX domains have
also been reported in a variety of different organisms
[12,13,17-19]. The most studied GRX fusion proteins in
eukaryotes are TRX-GRX fusions, containing CGFS class
GRXs modules. In these proteins, one to three GRX modules are linked to an N-terminal TRX-like module which
does not conserve the WC [G/P]PC active site of functional TRXs. S. cerevisiae Grx3 and Grx4 [11] and human
GLRX3 (PICOT) [20] are examples of these multidomain
GRXs.
Most GRXs are likely to participate in a diversity of processes that require redox-type regulation, although their
specific roles and targets in those processes are often
unclear. Examples of processes in which CPYC class GRXs
are involved in include activation of ribonucleotide
reductase, or 3'-phosphoadenylylsulfate reductase, reduction of ascorbate, regulation of the DNA binding activity
of nuclear factors, or protection against heavy metals
(reviewed in [21]). Examples of processes in which CGFS
class GRXs are involved include iron sulfur cluster biogenesis (Grx5), and regulation of cellular iron homeostasis
(Grx3 and Grx4) in S. cerevisiae [11,18,22], cytochrome-c
biogenesis in bacteria [23,24], PROKAR-(lipid membrane) proteins in archaea [25], and regulation of signal
transduction pathways in response to external signals (the
human PICOT) [20].
In this work we analyze the distribution and evolution of
GRX domains in archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes. We
study over one thousand proteins, containing at least one
GRX domain, from hundreds of different organisms and
trace the origin and evolution of the GRX domain within
the tree of life. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that single domain GRX proteins of the CGFS class have evolved
through duplication and divergence from one initial gene
that was present in the last common ancestor (LCA) of all
organisms. The same appears to hold true for single
domain GRX proteins of the CPYC class. We predict sets
of residues that are likely to be important for protein function in the CGFS and CPYC classes of GRXs. Remarkably,
we identify a case of convergent evolution in domain
architecture, where two independent recombination
events of a TRX domain to a GRX domain are likely to
have occurred. We also identify domain combinations
that, in the context of GRX domain evolution, appear to
function as the supra-domains proposed by Vogel et al.
[3].

Results
We have made a systematic identification of GRX
domains from the UNIPROT database (information summarized in Table 1). Over 75% of all GRX domains are
found in single domain proteins (Table 1). The other 25%
are found as a part of a variety of multidomain proteins.

proteins that were found are predicted by homology annotation of fully sequenced genomes. **Out of these, 34 sequences belong to the CCMC
class. ***Grand total of 1717 GRX domains.

For example, GRXs have combined with pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductases class-II domains in
thioredoxin-glutathione-reductase proteins, or with peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase domains, among others. An interesting case is that of the triple fusion between
the GRX domain and frataxin and rhodanese domains. In
this case, the frataxin-rhodanese cassette appears to act as
a supra domain of recombination [3] in the context of
GRX domain evolution, because proteins where the GRX
domain recombined exclusively either with the frataxin
domain or with the rhodanese domain are not found. In
addition to these and other well characterized protein
domains, GRXs are also associated with other types of less
well characterized protein domains (for example DUF296
domains). Many of these domains are recurrently found
in different proteins but have yet to be assigned a specific
function. Table 2 details the major domain types found to
combine with the different GRX classes. [Additional Files
1, 2 and 3 contain the sequences and alignments for the
GRX domains that have been identified in multidomain
proteins from the UNIPROT database.] Because of the
large number of sequences being analyzed we divided the
sequences into smaller sets for a more detailed and accurate analysis. We also analyzed the full set, with results

that are similar to the ones described below (data not
shown).
GRXs from single domain proteins
Figure 1A shows a condensed phylogenetic tree of single
domain GRX proteins. Sequences of TRX domains were
used as outgroup for the tree for control purposes. CPYC
class and CGFS class GRXs segregate well in the phylogenetic tree. GRXs of CCMC class cluster together, but also
within the CPYC class (cluster 6.1 within cluster 6). The
CCMC GRXs have only been identified in higher plants
(Embriophita) and in single domain proteins. This observation suggests that they may be an offspring or a subclass
of the CPYC class of GRXs. We also find that the third
position in the putative active centre of CCMC GRXs is
occupied by an uncharged amino acid that is not necessarily a methionine residue, but can also be a branched
amino acid. It is noteworthy that some GRXs that have,
overall, higher sequence similarity to GRXs of the CPYC
class contain active sites where the final cysteine residue
has been replaced by other residues. This is summarized
in Figure 1A, where for example in cluster 6, GRXs with
CGFS active sites are present. In addition, there are a few
proteins with high similarity to GRXs that have com-

Figure 1 (see previous page)
Condensed phylogenetic tree for single domain GRXs from UNIPROT database
Condensed phylogenetic tree for single domain GRXs from UNIPROT database. Panel A: Global tree. The outgroup on the lower left of the tree is composed of TRX single domain proteins (in yellow). All major divisions between clusters have bootstrap values of 100%, indicated by the "100" label. The CGFS class of GRXs is depicted on the upper branchs [in
green]. Sequences are more homogeneous on this class. The mid-lower branches depict CPYC class GRXs [in mauve]. There
is a wider variability in the sequences of this class. The clusters identified with the tag "Bacteria*" include almost all non-proteobacteria GRX domains. These include domains from Actinobacteria, Deinnococcus, Planktomycetes, Green sulfur bacteria, Green
non sulfur bacteria, Thermotoga, Aquifaceae, and Flavobacteria. The cluster identified with the tag "Bacteria**" include mostly
proteobacteria GRX domains. GRX domains from Cyanobacteria and Spirochaetes are also present in this cluster. Panel B:
Condensed phylogenetic tree of single domain GRXs in archaea. Panel C: Phylogenetic tree of GRX proteins for bacteria.
CGFS class GRXs [Cluster 1] have less variability in their sequence than CPYC class GRXs [other clusters]. Some GRX-like
proteins have lost their active site [XXXX in Cluster 2]. Panel D: Phylogenetic tree of GRX proteins for eukaryotes. CGFS
GRXs [in green] have less variability in their sequence than CPYC GRXS [in mauve]. Nevertheless, the variability in the
sequence of the active site for CGFS GRXs is far greater than that found in bacteria [compare to panel C].

pletely lost their active site (cluster 3 in Figure 1A, e-values<10-5). The function of these proteins is unknown, and
this may represent a situation where the GRX domain is
being co-opted for a new function that has yet to be characterized.
Within each class of GRXs, different taxa cluster roughly as
previously reported (see for example [26-28]). For example, in cluster 1 of Figure 1A bacterial GRXs of the CGFS
class group together, and apart from eukaryotic GRXs of
the same class. This is consistent with GRXs being present
at the LCA of the three kingdoms and is inconsistent with
massive HGT of GRX genes between different kingdoms.
In fact, CGFS class and CPYC class GRXs appear to have
been both present in the LCA of all branches in the tree,
because both classes of GRXs cluster apart and differentiation between archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes is only
observed within the clusters shown in Figure 1A.
A group of proteins that have been annotated as GRX-like
proteins in fully sequenced genomes, mostly in archaea
and eukaryotes but also in bacteria, appear to be somewhere in between TRXs and CPYC class GRXs in terms of
sequence similarity (clusters 8 and 9 in Figure 1A). They
have more variability in their sequence than the other
clusters from Figure 1A, but they are nevertheless similar
to other well characterized GRXs, with e-value ≤ 10-10.
They all contain a GRX-like putative active site sequence.
The bacterial sequences in this cluster come from groups
that are not typically considered as having GRXs (see caption for Figure 1A).
A detailed analysis of the data also reveals that CPYC class
GRXs have been found in all sequenced archaea genomes.
However, within Archaea, we were only able to find CGFS
class GRXs in Halobacteriales. Five sequences of the CGFS
class have been found in this group (see see Supplementary Table 1 in Additional File 4, Cluster 2 in Figure 1A
and Cluster 4 in Figure 1B). A more detailed analysis of

the DNA sequence for the genes that code for these GRXs
reveals the following.
a) The highest homology between the H. salinarium
CGFS class GRX and other non-archaea GRX is to a
Myxococcus xanthus GRX [see Supplementary Table 1 in
Additional File 4].
b) The codon usage of genes is a characteristic that can
often be used to identify HGT. This is so because the
evolution of an organism leads to an optimization of
the codon usage in genes for the specific physiology of
that organism [29]. We calculated the average codon
usage in the Myxococcus xanthus and in the H. salinarium genomes [29]. We also calculated the codon
usage for the CGFS class grx genes from H. salinarium
and M. xanthus. We found that the codon usage in the
CGFS class GRXs of Halobaterium is similar to the average codon usage in the Myxococcus genome. It is also
similar to the codon usage in the Myxococcus CGFS
class grx genes.
c) The borders of the CGFS class grx gene in H. salinarium are homologous to the flanking regions of the
transposon gene XAC3504 from the gamma proteobacteria Xanthomonas axonopodis.
d) The flanking regions of the CGFS class grx genes in
archaea could be degenerated palindromes. If this is
so, it may indicate the remains of a degenerated transposon. Transposons are responsible for gene mobility
within and between genes through HGT.
Taken together, these observations suggest that CGFS class
GRXs in archaea may have been the result of one HGT
from some proteobacteria ancestor to the halobacteriales.
Unlike in archaea, single domain CGFS class and CPYC
class GRXs are both widespread in bacteria, as shown in

Figure 1C. Both classes of GRXs appear to have existed as
such in the LCA of bacteria, because in general CGFS class
GRXs cluster together, as do CPYC class GRXs. Interestingly, some GRXs that are, sequence-wise, clearly included
in the CPYC class have evolved CGFC putative active centers (cluster 6 in Figure 1C; also see Additional Files 1, 2, 3,
5, 6, and 7), although no CGFS class GRXs with a second
cysteine in the active site where found.
Figure 1D shows a phylogenetic tree based on the
sequence alignment of eukaryotic single domain GRXs.
CGFS class and CPYC class GRXs are also commonly
found in eukaryotes. A fraction of CPYC class GRXs have
lost the second cysteine residue of their putative active site
(GRXs in clusters 3, 5, 6 and 8).
Sequence analysis of individual GRX domains from an
evolutionary and functional perspective
We compared the variability of the CPYC class alignments
to that of the CGFS alignments. This variability can be
quantified by calculating both, the average positional
entropy of the alignment and the normalized mutual
information (NMI) between each pair of positions in the
alignment (see Methods for details).

The higher the average positional entropy is, the higher
the variability per position in the alignment is (see e.g.
[30]). Based on this we find that the CPYC class has higher
sequence variability than the CGFS class. Although the
difference in variability between the two classes may be
due to the larger number of sequences that have been
identified for the CPYC class, we believe that this is not
the case, because the standard deviation of the positional
entropy in the two classes is almost the same (approximately 0.8 for the CPYC class and approximately 0.75 for
the CGFS class, Figure 2).
The results from NMI profiles support those from the
averaged position entropy, although the interpretation of
these profiles is more nuanced. On one hand, if two positions in the alignment have a NMI that is very high, one
can interpret this result as indicating that any changes in
the residue at one of the positions needs to be counterbalanced by a compensatory change in the residue of the
other position [30-35]. Thus, the residues in those positions are functionally constrained and functionally
important for the protein. On the other hand, positions
with residues that are highly conserved will have a NMI
with any other position in the alignment that is not significantly different from zero. Therefore, highly conserved
positions are also likely to be functionally constrained. All
the information regarding conservation and co-variation
of residues is summarized in Figure 2. Many of the residues predicted in Figure 2 as being functionally important
are known to be involved in the overall function of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/66

GRX domains. For example, residues in the putative active
site of both classes of GRXs are marked with a blue transparent rectangle. In the same figure, one can see that CGFS
class GRXs have a larger number of positions in the alignment that either have high NMI interaction with other
position (black lines and black residues) or are highly
conserved (red lines and red residues). If our results are
general and our interpretation is correct, GRXs of the
CGFS class may require more positions to be constrained,
if they are to remain functional.
An alternative explanation for the differences in the variability between CPYC and CGFS GRXs is the following. The
larger variability of CPYC GRXs could also be observed if
CPYC class GRXs had an earlier origin than CGFS GRXs,
because this could have allowed for CPYC GRXs to have
evolved for a longer time. Our results suggest that this
explanation is unlikely. In Figure 1, the CPYC and CGFS
classes of GRXs cluster perfectly apart, and the branching
structure of the tree indicates that both classes were
already present in the LCA of archaea, bacteria and
eukaryotes. This suggests that both proteins may have
had, roughly, a similar amount of time to evolve. The
DNA sequences of the different domains can be further
analyzed in order to assess if the two classes of GRXs have
been evolving for significantly different times. It is known
that the rate of synonymous mutations in different genes
is similar, even when the rate of non-synonymous mutations is quite different [33]. Therefore, by comparing the
average percentage of synonymous substitutions per
codon between the CGFS class and the CPYC class GRXs
in the conserved positions of each multiple alignment,
one can obtain additional information regarding whether
these proteins have been evolving for approximately the
same time. This percentage is similar in both classes of
proteins. In addition, we calculated the average ratio of
non-synonymous (Ka) over synonymous (Ks) mutations
per codon to be <Ka/Ks> = 2.9 for the GRX domains of
each of the two classes. This ratio can also be used to estimate the rate of evolution of proteins [36]. Taken
together, all these data are consistent with the notion that
the difference in the number of highly conserved positions in both classes of GRXs is not due to a difference in
the time they had to evolve. The protein and DNA
sequence alignments are provided [see Additional Files 1,
2, 3, 5, 6, and 7].
GRXs domains in multidomain proteins
As stated above, and summarized in Table 2 and Figure 3,
multidomain proteins that contain GRX domains are
widespread. To more accurately analyze these GRX
domains we isolated their sequence from the multidomain proteins, as described in the Methods section. The
GRX domains were then aligned using MEGA4. The multiple alignment was used to build a phylogenetic tree. A

Functional importance of residues in the different position of the alignment
Functional importance of residues in the different position of the alignment. Sequences were divided into two
classes (CGFS and CPYC). Then, they were further divided into Archaeal, Bacterial and Eukaryotic sequences. Because archaea
only have a small number of GRX proteins of the CGFS class, we show the results for archaea GRXs of the CPYC class only.
Subsequently, Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and Position Entropy were calculated for the different alignments. Vertical red lines in the plots of the first and second column indicate positions in the alignment that are highly conserved. Horizontal
black lines in the plots of the first and second columns indicate positions in the alignment that have high NMI with at least one
other position. Numbers in columns one and two indicate the position in the alignment. First column – CPYC class GRXs. Second column – CGFS class GRXs. Third and fourth columns – Detailed positions in the alignments that are colored, with the
consensus residues found in those alignment positions. The putative active centers are shaded in blue. Average entropy per
residue is also shown in columns three and four.

condensed version of this tree is shown in Figure 4. It is
striking that, with few exceptions, all GRX domains from
proteins containing a specific type of domain combination are, sequence-wise, closely related amongst themselves. They cluster together in the phylogenetic tree and
apart from GRX domains extracted from other types of
proteins. The simplest interpretation of the data presented
in Figure 4 is that a specific type of GRX-containing multidomain proteins is descendent from an original gene

fusion event. This event is likely to have occurred before
the LCA of all organisms containing the relevant type of
multidomain protein (Figure 3). If independent gene
fusion events between different GRX domains and a given
protein domain occurred at different stages of the evolutionary process, then one would not expect the isolated
GRX domains from these fusion proteins to cluster
together and apart from all other GRX domains.

Figure 3 representation for the distribution of major groups of multidomain proteins containing GRX domains in the tree of
life
Schematic
Schematic representation for the distribution of major groups of multidomain proteins containing GRX
domains in the tree of life. The most ancient fusion appears to be that of GRX domains to pyridine nucleotide disulphide
oxireductase domains because it is present in all kingdoms. TRX-GRX fusions may also have been present in the LCA (Latest
Common Ancestor) of all three branches. Proteins standing at the end of a node are the ones identified in current organisms.
Proteins standing on top of the branches of the tree and surrounded by upper and under lines that are dashed suggest when
that type of protein may have first originated. All domains identified as unknown in the figure have not been identified in any of
the available domain databases. All domains identified as PFAM in the figure have been identified in PFAM as associated to proteins of unknown function. Panel A – Non- TRX-GRX fusion proteins. Panel B – TRX-GRX fusion proteins. TRX-GRX fusion
proteins exist in all three major branches of the tree of life. Duplication of the GRX domain appears to have occurred early in
the eukaryotic life history. Some TRX-GRX proteins appear to have undergone two consecutive partial duplication/recombination events of the GRX domain after the initial TRX-GRX fusion. Distribution of TRX-GRX fusion proteins may result from a)
multiple independent deletions of the TRX-GRX fusion in different bacterial branches and in the eukaryotic branch, followed
by a new TRX-GRX fusion event in the eukaryotes (Scenario A, red lines), b) Two independent TRX-GRX fusion events, one
in archaea and one in eukaryotes followed by horizontal gene transfer from archaea to bacteria (Scenario B, dashed mauve
line), or c) TRX-GRX fusion originating in the ancestor of some bacterial lineages, followed by horizontal gene transfer to the
ancestor of Archaea and an independent TRX-GRX fusion event in eukaryotes (Scenario C, dashed black line). See Discussion
for further details.
Only the GRX-pyridine nucleotide disulphide oxireductase fusion and the TRX-GRX fusion are found in all three
branches of the tree of life. All other multidomain proteins that contain a GRX domain are found only in specific branches of that tree (Figure 3A). For example,
peroxiredoxin-GRX fusions are found so far only in proteobacteria. TRX-GRX multidomain proteins appear to
have a more complex history. In eukaryotes, all GRX
domains in TRX-GRX fusion proteins are of the CGFS
class. In contrast, they are of the CPYC class in bacteria
and archaea. This suggests that two independent recombination events took place to form the original TRX-GRX
fusion proteins. In addition, TRX-GRX fusion proteins
have undergone further domain shuffling in eukaryotes.
An analysis of the phylogenetic tree in Figure 4 suggests a
duplication of the GRX domain to have occurred in TRX-

GRX domains, forming TRX-GRX-GRX proteins before
fungi, plants and animals have separated. A more recent
duplication-recombination event of the GRX domain is
present in TRX-GRX-GRX-GRX proteins found in plants
and in some protists. Based on how the different GRX
domains cluster in the phylogenetic tree, we cannot
exclude that the duplication events in plants and protists
are independent. However, the bootstrap of the tree for
the separate clustering of GRX domains from protists and
plants is lower than 50% (Figure 4, clusters 1 and 6). This
means that only in less than 50% of the trees built using
bootstrap do we find separation of the protists cluster and
the plant cluster. Such a fact suggests that this final recombination event may have taken place either a) in a common ancestor of plants and protists or b) in one of the
branches, followed by HGT to the other branch. Neverthe-

Figure 4
Phylogenetic tree of GRX domains from multidomain proteins
Phylogenetic tree of GRX domains from multidomain proteins. CGFS class GRX domains [in green] have less variability in their sequence than CPYC class GRX domains [in mauve]. Note that GRX domains from NrdH-like proteins cluster
closer to GRX domains from TRX-GRX fusion proteins, and within the CPYC class. This is consistent with previous results
from biochemical assays and sequence analysis that suggest NrdH-like proteins to cluster between TRXs and GRXs [51].

less, it is of interest that the TRX-GRX multidomain proteins may have gone through several cases of convergent
evolution of domain architecture.
In eukaryotes, most GRX domains in multidomain proteins are of the CGFS class (Table 2 and Figure 4). The
exceptions are the CPYC class GRX domains recombined
with pyrimidine disulphide oxireductase domains. In

contrast, in prokaryotes, most GRX domains in multidomain proteins are of the CPYC class (Table 2 and Figure
4). GRX- containing protein architectures that are specific
to bacteria are:
a) Proteins with a domain structure of the type peroxiredoxin-GRX, with the GRX domain being of the
CPYC class. Peroxiredoxins are thiol dependent perox-

idases involved in cell protection against oxidative
stress.
b) Proteins with a domain structure DUF296-GRX.
DUF296 is a domain of unknown function that contains what appears to be a zinc finger like motif [37].
This suggests that these proteins may be involved in
DNA binding, probably acting in regulation of gene
expression. The GRX domain is of the CPYC class.
c) Proteins with a domain structure frataxin-rhodanese-GRX. Single domain frataxin proteins are
involved in iron storage and metabolism and in ironsulfur cluster biogenesis [22,38]. The acidic aspartate
and glutamate residues that are responsible for iron
binding in the frataxin protein are, for the most part,
conserved in the fusion proteins, suggesting that these
domains may remain at least partially functional. On
the other hand, proteins containing rhodanese
domains participate in sulfur metabolism [39]. Again,
the cysteine and glycine residues of the rhodanese
active center are for the most part conserved in the
fusion proteins, suggesting that the rhodanese
domains may remain at least partially functional.
Considering that S. cerevisiae Grx5 is implicated in
mitochondrial maturation of iron-sulfur clusters [18],
this suggests a connection between the complex
frataxin-rhodanese-GRX proteins and iron-sulfur
(cluster) metabolism.

Discussion
GRX domains are a part of the thioredoxin-fold superfamily. This superfamily includes domains of several
classes, such as TRXs, PRXs (Peroxiredoxins), GSTs (glutathione S-transferase), GRXs, among others. Each of
these domain classes is involved in different types of
redox reactions that follow dissimilar mechanisms. In this
work we analyzed GRX protein domains from a wide
number of organisms in the tree of life. We confirm that
GRXs are widespread over the three major kingdoms of
life, both as individual proteins and as domains of larger
proteins. We detect no signal of extensive HGT of GRXs
among the different taxa, except for GRXs of the CGFS
class between bacteria and Halobacteriales (archaea).
Because GRXs are present in archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes, our results suggest that both the CPYC class and the
CGFS class of GRXs were already present in the LCA. This
inference follows from accepting the proposal that bacteria diverged first, followed by the divergence between
archaea and eukaryotes [40]. If one accepts this view, it
follows that archaea and many bacterial branches have
lost GRXs of the CGFS class somewhere in the early stages
of their evolution.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/66

Our analysis of the available data leads us to speculate
about the origin of GRXs. One should recall that GRXs
and TRXs belong to the same protein super family because
they have a common structural fold. In addition, when
one uses BLAST to search for GRX sequence homologues
in the UNIPROT database, we find TRX domains as the
closest relatives of GRX domains (data not shown). Taking these two facts together, one could make the case that
both types of domains may have originated from the same
common ancestor gene. If this is so, then the clusters in
Figure 1A may be indicative of how TRXs and GRXs have
diverged. Initially, a TRX ancestor may have been duplicated well before the LCA. After divergence, this duplicated TRX ended up becoming the ancestor of the GRX
domain proteins. At this stage, further duplication events,
either of the GRX domain or of the TRX domain may have
led to the formation of the different GRX classes. The
branching structure of the tree shown in Figure 1A,
together with the active site information that is also
shown in that figure, leads us to further speculate that
sequences from clusters 8 and 9 may be fossil sequences
that are remnants of intermediate steps in the divergence
of the original GRX domain towards current day GRXs of
the CGFS and CPYC classes. If one accepts this picture,
then it follows that the original ancestral of all GRXs is of
the dithiolic type (that is with a CXXC active center) and
that CGFS class GRXs would be more recent than CPYC
class GRXs, even though both may have been present at
the LCA of archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes. Consistently
with this view, CPYC class GRXs sometimes lose the second cysteine in their active site, while no GRX with two
cysteines in its active site was found in clusters with CGFS
class GRXs.
If the picture described in the previous paragraph is correct, CGFS-class GRXs would be the more specialized
GRXs, which could entail having stronger functional constraints against mutations in their sequence. Our analysis
finds that GRXs of the CGFS class indeed have a higher
percentage of conserved residues than those of the CPYC
class and that the average residue variability, over the
stretches of the proteins where residue conservation is
low, is similar in the CGFS and CPYC classes. This further
supports the notion that the lower sequence diversity in
the CGFS class may be due to this class having functional
constraints on a larger set of residues than the CPYC class.
A deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanisms of
the two GRX classes and of the protein dynamics during
catalysis would be necessary if one is to confirm this speculation and explain it in a mechanistically rational way.
Nevertheless, enzymatic studies already indicate that the
mechanism of action of both types of GRXs is different
[11,17].

GRX modules as parts of multidomain proteins are widespread. Figure 3 summarizes the broad phylogenetic distribution of these proteins. The only GRX- containing
multidomain architecture that is common to the three
kingdoms [with the same class of GRX module] is that
found in GRX-pyridine nucleotide disulfide oxireductase
proteins. This suggests that this type of fusion protein may
be ancestral to the divergence between the three kingdoms
of life.
The question arises on the biological advantages of such
domain fusions. In the case of S. cerevisiae Grx3, the TRX
domain seems to be required for the nuclear targeting of
the molecule [41], without having enzyme activity as
redoxin. However, in other cases both domains might
retain the original enzyme activities and be involved in
different stages of the same biological process. Domain
combinations involving redoxin modules could be an
evolutionary strategy to incorporate into a single peptide
the enzymatic redox activity and the target of such redox
control. The case of the fusions between GRX domains of
the CGFS class and frataxin-rhodanese domains could be
an example of this situation. The participation of CGFS
class GRXs in the synthesis of iron-sulfur clusters is well
known to occur in eukaryotes [18], although such participation has not been demonstrated in bacteria up to date.
An interesting observation is that while TRX-GRX proteins
in eukaryotes have GRX modules of the CGFS class, TRXGRX proteins in bacteria and archaea have GRX modules
of the CPYC class. This is consistent with the fusion
between TRX and GRX modules having occurred independently in evolution at least twice. Furthermore, the
TRX-GRX fusion proteins in eukaryotes have undergone
further evolution, giving rise to proteins where the GRX
module has been duplicated once or twice. The observations are consistent with the following scenarios (Figure
3B):
a) Scenario A: TRX-GRX fusion, with GRX belonging
to the CPYC class, present at the LCA of the three kingdoms. TRX-GRX fusion lost in the eukaryotic branch,
with a subsequent, independent, new TRX-GRX fusion
event occurring in eukaryotes, this time with a GRX of
the CGFS class.
b) Scenario B: TRX-GRX fusion, with GRX belonging
to the CPYC class, occurring in ancestral archaea, followed by HGT of this protein to the common ancestral
of several bacterial lineages. Independent TRX-GRX
fusion event occurring in eukaryotes, this time with a
GRX of the CGFS class.
c) Scenario C: TRX-GRX fusion, with GRX belonging
to the CPYC class, occurring in ancestral bacteria, fol-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/66

lowed by horizontal gene transfer of this protein to the
common ancestral of archaea. Independent TRX-GRX
fusion event occurring in eukaryotes, this time with a
GRX of the CGFS class.
We do not have enough data to distinguish between the
three hypotheses. However, Occam's razor suggests that
scenario b) may be the most likley, because that is the scenario where a smaller number of events would have had
to occur. This would point to the TRX-GRX hybrid proteins as an interesting example of convergent evolution in
domain architecture.

Conclusion
In this study we trace the origin of glutaredoxins to the
LCA of archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes. We propose
probable patterns of evolution for the different GRX
classes and trace the origin and evolution of recombination events between the GRX domain and other protein
domains. We find at an interesting case of convergent evolution in the domain architecture of TRX-GRX proteins.

Methods
Retrieval and curation of GRX sequences
We used the UNIPROT database [42] to retrieve all
sequences analyzed in this study. We downloaded the
sequences of all proteins containing a GRX domain in
FASTA format [43]. These proteins have been identified
using PSI-BLAST [44]. As query sequences for the BLAST
search we have used all GRX domain sequences from S.
cerevisiae, Escherichia coli and Halobacterium salinarium. All
cDNA sequences corresponding to the UNIPROT entries
were retrieved from Genebank [45]. Once all GRX
domains were identified, we analyzed them in isolation.

Because a large number of very similar sequences were
identified, we used the "Decrease Redundancy" program
at SWISSPROT [46] to reduce the number of sequences to
analyze. We set the algorithm to eliminate all sequences
that had more than 90% identity to the sequence that was
retained in the set. We then cross-checked the eliminated
sequences and re-introduced any sequence from an organism for which no close relative with a similar sequence
had been retained. This was done using a local PERL
script. A summary statistics of the analyzed sequences is
shown in Table 1.
Sequence alignments and building of phylogenetic trees
MEGA4 [47] was used to build sequence alignments and
the phylogenetic trees shown in Figure 1. All trees presented here were built using a minimum evolution model
and bootstrapped one thousand times. Dendroscope [48]
was used for tree analysis and representation. TRX domain
sequences were used for control purposes as an outgroup
for the tree building alignments. As a control we have also

build trees from the same set of sequence using neighbor
joining methods, and maximum likelihood methods. The
resulting trees were similar to those shown in the Figures
1 and 4.

Domain identification in multidomain proteins
Multidomain proteins were identified using the Domain
Fishing server [49] and PROSITE [50]. The GRX domains
as identified by PROSITE were then manually excised
from the longer proteins. Whenever a domain was exclusively identified by the Domain Fishing Server, that
domain was then manually excised from the longer proteins.

Analysis of residue conservation in alignments
Mutual information between different position pairs in an
alignment is indicative of how much the residue variation
in one position constrains the residue variation in the
other position. It was calculated using the formula
MI ( i, j ) = ∑ m = AA types , Position i

⎛ f ( AA [ i, m ] , AA [ j, k ] × ) ⎞

∑ k = AA types, Position j ⎜ log ⎛ f ( AA[ i,m ], AA[ j,k ] ) ⎞ ⎟

⎝ f ( AA [ i,m ] ) f ( AA [ j , k ] ) ⎠ ⎠

, where f(AA [i, m]) represents the relative frequency of
amino acid of type m in position i of the alignment and
f(AA [i, m], AA [j, k]) represents the join relative frequency of that amino acid in position m and of amino
acid of type k in position j of the alignment. The higher the
covariance between any two positions, the higher the
Mutual Information between those two positions will be.
For representation purposes in Figure 2, we define normalized mutual information as

Positional entropy measures how high or low is the variability at a given alignment position. Positional entropy for
