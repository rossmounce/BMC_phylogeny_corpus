clinical isolates

Abstract
Background: M. catarrhalis is a gram-negative, gamma-proteobacterium and an opportunistic human pathogen
associated with otitis media (OM) and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). With direct
and indirect costs for treating these conditions annually exceeding $33 billion in the United States alone, and
nearly ubiquitous resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics among M. catarrhalis clinical isolates, a greater
understanding of this pathogen’s genome and its variability among isolates is needed.
Results: The genomic sequences of ten geographically and phenotypically diverse clinical isolates of M. catarrhalis
were determined and analyzed together with two publicly available genomes. These twelve genomes were
subjected to detailed comparative and predictive analyses aimed at characterizing the supragenome and
understanding the metabolic and pathogenic potential of this species. A total of 2383 gene clusters were
identified, of which 1755 are core with the remaining 628 clusters unevenly distributed among the twelve isolates.
These findings are consistent with the distributed genome hypothesis (DGH), which posits that the species
genome possesses a far greater number of genes than any single isolate. Multiple and pair-wise whole genome
alignments highlight limited chromosomal re-arrangement.
Conclusions: M. catarrhalis gene content and chromosomal organization data, although supportive of the DGH,
show modest overall genic diversity. These findings are in stark contrast with the reported heterogeneity of the
species as a whole, as wells as to other bacterial pathogens mediating OM and COPD, providing important insight
into M. catarrhalis pathogenesis that will aid in the development of novel therapeutic regimens.

Background
Moraxella catarrhalis are pathogenic, gram-negative
diplococci that colonize the mucosal tissues of the
human nasopharynx and respiratory tract by forming
biofilms [1-4]. M. catarrhalis is one of the three primary
bacterial pathogens etiologically associated with otitis
media (OM), along with non-typeable Haemophilus
influenzae (NTHi) and Streptococcus pneumoniae [1,3].
Instances of OM are responsible for more visits to

healthcare providers than any other pediatric disease in
the developed world and infections with M. catarrhalis
cause approximately 20% of all incidences (recently
reviewed in [5,6] and [7]). Additionally, OM is a leading
cause of preventable hearing loss in children worldwide
[7-9], adding greatly to its public health cost. Furthemore, M. catarrhalis is the second most common bacterial cause of exacerbations of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) after H. influenzae [10].
COPD is among the top five causes of death worldwide
and infections with M. catarrhalis cause 2-4 million
exacerbations of COPD per annum in the United States
alone [7,11]. Collectively, these respiratory tract infections
create a major burden on the healthcare system, accounting for a combined annual loss conservatively estimated at
$33 billion in the United States alone [11,12]. From a

public health perspective, however, the point of greatest
concern regarding OM and COPD is the high frequency of antibiotic administration, leading to the
development of multiply resistant isolates [6,7]. Nearly
100% of M. catarrhalis clinical isolates are beta-lactam
resistant, underscoring the need to develop alternative
treatment modalities, including a M. catarrhalis vaccine (recently reviewed in [3]).
Recently, de Vries et al published the first complete
M. catarrhalis genome, strain RH4, and compared it to
the unpublished genome sequence of ATCC 43617 [13].
The gene content of these two strains demonstrated a
high degree of homology, suggesting M. catarrhalis clinical isolates may possess only limited genetic diversity,
in contrast to the reported heterogeneity of the species
[14-16]. The Distributed Genome Hypothesis holds that
pathogenic bacteria, especially those causing chronic
infections, have access to a supragenome that is larger
than that of any individual member of that species and
that, through homologous recombination, individual
strains shuffle their genetic information as a defensive
response to assault by the host [17]. Consequently, any
effort at controlling M. catarrhalis, whether via vaccine
or chemotherapeutic intervention, must be rooted in a
firm understanding of the core and distributed elements
of this species genomic composition. Toward that end,

we characterized the supragenome of M. catarrhalis,
determined from the sequencing and comparative genomic analysis of twelve clinical isolates. Furthermore,
mathematical modeling demonstrated that we have
sequenced a sufficient number of M. catarrhalis genomes to have adequately characterized both the core
and supragenomes of this pathogen. Finally, we provide
a context-rich, detailed analysis of the M. catarrhalis
supragenome and its implications towards pathogenesis.

Results
Descriptive Characteristics of the Finite M. catarrhalis
Supragenome Model

Detailed descriptions of the strains utilized in this analysis are present in Table 1. The strains chosen for this
analysis represent a geographically and clinically diverse
collection of isolates from the middle ear, respiratory
tract and blood stream collected from North America
and Europe ([18,19]; this study). M. catarrhalis genomes
range between 1.78 to 1.96 Mbp (an 10.1% difference),
with a mean size of 1.89 Mbp (Table 1). This range
represents 95.3% to 105.3% of the previously published
M. catarrhalis RH4 genome [13]. Interestingly, RH4 is
among the smallest sequenced isolates reported to date;
only strains O35E, 46P47B1, and 12P80B1 are as small
or smaller. The remaining strains possess an average of

57 kbp of additional DNA compared to RH4. The
twelve M. catarrhalis strains analyzed in this study collectively contain 21,960 predicted coding sequences
(CDS). These data were used to predict both the percent
coverage of the species supragenome we had achieved,
and the total number of genes present in the species
using the finite supragenome model as described previously [20,21]. Grouping of the CDS into clusters of
orthologous genes identified 2383 clusters; of these,
1755 are present in each strain, representing the core
genome of M. catarrhalis (Table 2). The remaining 628
gene clusters are either present in multiple, but not all,
strains (453) or found only in a single strain (175), and
represent the distributed and unique gene clusters of
the supragenome, respectively (Figure 1). Figure 2A
describes the change in the number of both the core
and total gene clusters predicted by the finite supragenome model as each additional genome is sequenced.
Likewise, Figure 2B illustrates the expected number of
novel gene clusters identified with the inclusion of each
additional sequenced genome to the supragenome.
Relationship Analysis of M. catarrhalis Genome Isolates

MLST analyses demonstrated that each of the twelve
genomes represented a different sequence type, including four novel sequence types and novel sequence variants for the fumC and adk alleles present in O35E
(Table 3 and Figure 3A), indicating success in selecting
a diverse group of strains for sequence analysis. Because
of the expected high degree of genomic mosaicism
resulting from extensive horizontal gene transfer, relationship dendrograms were constructed by employing a
non-phylogenetic identity-by-state, whole-genome clustering method [14,22]. In one case, sequence polymorphisms present in the core genes were used to
construct the relationships, and in a second analysis

gene possession data were used (Figures 3B and 3C,
respectively). These analyses revealed intriguing differences depending upon the analytical method; no clear
clade structure could be determined using allelic differences within the core genome, however, the use of the
distributed genome data produced a dendrogram that
was broadly similar to that generated from the MLST
data, albeit with several exceptions. Interestingly, all
three methods consistently formed two clusters; one
cluster consisting of strains ATCC 43617, 7169, and
BC1, and a second group comprised of 101P30B1,
CO72, and 103P14B1. Notably, the consistent clustering
of these two groups of strains does not correlate with
patient age group, geographic origin, COPD exacerbation or OM. These data suggest that using any of these
methods alone is insufficient for correctly inferring the
relationships among M. catarrhalis isolates.
An exhaustive pair-wise comparison of all possible
strain pairs (n = 66) was performed to gauge the mean
and range of gene possession variability within the species (Figure 4). This analysis compares the sum of all
gene clusters present in both strains (similarity score),
the sum of all clusters not present in both strains (difference score) and the remainder of the latter subtracted
from the former (comparison score) to provide an
objective metric to quantify the relationship between
any two strains. These analyses revealed that any two
strains differed on average by the possession of 217.7 ±
55.9 gene clusters.
Analyses for Mobile Genetic Elements and Codon Bias

Searches were performed to identify known mobile
genetic elements by querying the annotation records of
each genome for plasmid, transposon or phage-associated genes (Table 4). Plasmid-specific sequences were
identified in a single genome (BC7), underscoring the

plasmid, pLQ510 [24,26]; however, annotation records
for this region also identify an incomplete VirB-family
type four secretion system (T4SS), multiple transposases
and a resolvase not reported in pLQ510, suggesting that
this sequence may represent either an extra-chromosomally
maintained conjugative plasmid or an integrative and
conjugative element (ICE; recently reviewed in [27]).
Phage-associated annotations varied between strains, but
comprised only 0.2% to 2.5% of all identified ORFs per
genome, while transposon-associated annotations
accounted for only 0.15% to 0.44% of all ORFs per genome. Each genome contains at least one homolog of the
IS4, IS200 and IS1016 transposon families or subfamilies, while five genomes contain an additional IS605
family transposon. Interestingly, an IS1016 element was
found adjacent to a nitrate uptake locus in all twelve
strains and, in those strains that contained a second
IS1016 element, this element was often inserted in near a
collection of dehydrogenases and hypothetical proteins.
Likewise, the IS4 element was consistently flanked by a
predicted aspartate kinase and amino acid/peptide transporter and, in strains with an additional IS4 element,
could also be found in close proximity to the IS1016 element located within the nitrate uptake locus. The IS200
element was also found within a locus containing the
mechanosensitive ion channel, mscS, and the CRISPRassociated protein, NE0113. IS605 elements were found
nearby an IS200 element in all cases. These data illustrate
a substantial conservation of transposon elements among
M. catarrhalis clinical isolates.
Genes stably maintained within a species tend to exhibit similar codon usage, whereas recently acquired genes
often use less frequent or rarely utilized codons
(reviewed in [28]). This difference in codon usage may
result from selective pressure towards optimal translational efficiency in each organism, shaped by differences
in the iso-accepting tRNA pools available to the donor
and recipient bacterial species [29-31]. To this end, a
comprehensive analysis of codon usage was undertaken.
The total codon usage of the supragenome demonstrates
that leucine and cysteine are the most and least encoded
amino acids, respectively, while five amino acids (Asn,
Lys, Val, Ala, and Gly) demonstrated minor alterations
in usage within proteins encoded by the core and distributed genomes (data not shown). A plot of GC usage
in the synonymously variable third position (GC3s)
against the effective number of codons (Nc) encoded for
in each gene present in the core and distributed genome
subsets identified a spherical distribution approximately
centered at 35% GC3 s for the core genes, whereas the
distributed genes were more diffuse, with no central
location (Figure 5). These data highlight a preference in
the core genome for codons with adenosine or thymidine in the synonymously variable third position, as

Unless previously determined (*), the eight genes used for the M. catarrhalis MLST typing scheme were identified within each genome and used to query the
MLST database for the corresponding sequence variant number [13,16]. The sequence number combinations were then used to identify the sequence type,
where NP-ST and NP-SV denote sequence types and sequence variants not present in the MLST database at the time of analysis, respectively.

>80% of core sequences have a GC3 s between 30 and
45%. Conversely, no such bias appears among the distributed genome.
An organism demonstrating an absolute bias toward
optimal translational efficiency would utilize a single
codon per amino acid in each gene (Nc = 20), whereas
an organism displaying no codon usage bias would utilize each codon equally for any given amino acid in a
gene (Nc = 61; [32]). As relatively few genes are comprised solely of optimal codons, a gene suspected of
exhibiting a translational efficiency bias would be
expected to have an Nc score less than 40 [32,33]. The
observed mean Nc values for the core and distributed
genome subsets are 46.9 ± 5.9 and 46.1 ± 7.4, respectively. However, closer inspection reveals that only 10%
(126/1668) of the core genes subset has an Nc value <
40, whereas 18% (170/573) of the distributed genes subset fulfill this criterion, highlighting another difference
in codon usage between core and distributed genes and
supporting a possible role for translational efficiency in
shaping the codon bias of the distributed genome.
Conservation of CRISPR Elements and Loci Among
M. catarrhalis Isolates

Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat
(CRISPR) elements serve as a means of bacterial selfdefense against bacteriophage and plasmid infection
(recently reviewed in [34] and [35]). An average prokaryotic genome contains one CRISPR element comprised
of 28 repeat-spacer units. The genome of M. catarrhalis
RH4 possesses a greater than average number of
CRISPR loci, containing one putative and two known
CRISPR elements [13]. We sought to determine if elevated numbers of CRISPR elements are common
amongst isolates of M. catarrhalis by analyzing each

genome for the number, placement and context of
CRISPR loci. Of the twelve strains, only O35E did not
contain a CRISPR element. The remaining eleven strains
contained an average of 1.4 ± 0.5 CRISPR elements
(Table 5). These elements were comprised of direct
repeats of 28.1 ± 0.3 nucleotides separated by spacer
sequences 32 ± 0.7 bp in length, consistent with previous reports [36,37]. Additional analysis of the direct
repeat segments indicated that the direct repeat
sequence consensus for each CRISPR element could be
split into one of two clades, of which clade 1 contains
80% of the repeat sequences (12/15; Figure 6). While
the length of the direct repeat and spacer sequence elements demonstrated only minor variation between
strains, the number of spacer sequences varied substantially, ranging between 3 to 48 per element (18.3 ± 11.7
bp). No similarity could be found amongst the spacer
consensus sequences between strains, nor does similarity
exist between the spacer consensus sequences and a
non-M. catarrhalis nucleic acid sequence, presently precluding the identification of the invading nucleic acid(s)
these sequences defend against.
Analysis of the gene content flanking the CRISPR elements revealed that half were flanked by CRISPRassociated (Cas) genes. However, a review of the
CRISPR position on the draft genome contigs showed
several CRISPR regions were present at contig ends,
suggesting that the flanking Cas genes may be present
in other contig sequences. Concordantly, the genome
annotation data identified Cas genes in all genomes,
including O35E. Analysis of the surrounding non-Cas
genes revealed that CRISPR elements were often located
in close proximity to DNA recombination and repair
genes. For the eleven strains with confirmed CRISPR
elements, the percentage of phage-associated sequence

Figure 3 Relatedness among strains. Each strain was assayed for its relatedness to every other strain by several methods. A) The MLST type of
each isolate was identified as described in the Methods; the scale bar indicates topological distance in relative distance units (RDU) between
strains. Isolate O35E was excluded from A) as it contained two sequence variants (adk and fumC alleles) that were not present in the
M. catarrhalis MLST database at the time of submission. In addition, * denotes strains whose MLST types were taken from the M. catarrhalis MLST
database [16]; all other data presented here are taken from pyrosequencing efforts. Neighbor-Joining analysis of was performed for both point
mutations in the core genome (B) or genic differences in the distributed (C) genome. Branches in the same neighbor group are identically colorcoded and length bars indicate the topological distance measured in 1-average nucleotide identity between each genome.

Whole Genome Comparison of M. catarrhalis Isolates and
Analysis of Homologous Recombination

To facilitate an overview of genetic re-arrangements at
the chromosome level, the individual contigs of the 10
M. catarrhalis genomes sequenced for this study, as
well as the publically available ATCC 43617 draft genome, were ordered relative to the completed RH4 genome. These eleven reordered pseudo-molecules where
then compared to RH4 in both whole genome multiple
and pair-wise alignments using Mauve [38]. Mauve
identifies discrete regions of local homology between
genomes that have no internal re-arrangements, known as
local collinear blocks (LCBs). The multiple alignment
results indicate a high degree of structural conservation, as
the alignment is primarily comprised of a small number of
large LCBs common to multiple genomes (Figure 7).
The overall similarity of LCB placement among the
genomes suggested that one or more genomes might be
considerably more divergent from RH4 than the majority.

Figure 6 M. catarrhalis CRISPR direct repeat consensus
sequences cluster into two clades. The relationship of the direct
repeat (DR) consensus sequences of the 15 identified CRISPR loci
were analyzed by the Neighbor-Joining method with distances
calculated from the absolute number of differences with
proportionally distributed gaps, computed from 1000 bootstrapping replications with random tie-braking.

Indeed, pair-wise comparisons of each genome to RH4
indicated that the majority of the strains exhibited a high
degree of chromosomal synteny with RH4, often comprising the entire genome in 1-4 LCBs (Figure 8). ATCC
43617 differs the most from RH4 (11 LCBs), whereas
O35E is nearly identical (1 LCB).
Metabolic Reconstruction of the M. catarrhalis
Supragenome

A detailed comparative analysis of the central metabolic
pathways of the twelve sequenced M. catarrhalis strains
was performed (Additional File 1, Table S1). In general,
CDS of the enzymes of the central metabolic pathways
were highly conserved among all M. catarrhalis strains,
with only a few instances of apparent frameshiftdisrupted ORFs. In some cases, shorter CDSs were identified in one genome, e.g. phosphoglycerate kinase in the
ATCC 43617 genome, but none of the genes were completely absent in any genome.
Similar to RH4, all sequenced M. catarrhalis genomes
appear to possess an incomplete glycolysis pathway,
lacking the genes encoding the key enzymes phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase, while the gluconeogenic pathway was intact in all analyzed genomes. The

and each homologous LCB is identically colored in each genome. LCB’s oriented above the center line for each alignment are in the same

tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, while incomplete in M.
catarrhalis due to the absence of genes encoding both
succinyl-Coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase subunits, is
otherwise conserved in each genome and this disruption
may be bypassed by the conserved glyoxylate shunt. The
reversible conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate by
succinyl-CoA synthetase may be substituted by succinylCoA:3-oxo-acid CoA-transferase (SCOT, 2.8.3.5), which
catalyzes the reversible transfer of Coenzyme A (CoA)
from one carboxylic acid to another, e.g. transfer of
CoA from succinyl-CoA to oxaloacetate [39,40]. Two
ORFs previously annotated in RH4 as putative 3-oxoacid
CoA-transferase alpha subunit (MCR_0737) and putative
beta subunit (MCR_0738) could potentially catalyze this
reaction [13]. However, MCR_0737 only encodes the
N-terminal part of the alpha subunit whereas
MCR_0738 only encodes the C-terminal part of the beta

subunit. Interestingly, a detailed comparative analysis of
the corresponding chromosomal region in all strains
revealed four variant regions encoding the putative
SCOT subunits (Figure 9). Two strains, O35E and
46P47B1 (type 1 region), showed the same organization
as RH4, containing two CDS encoding the N-terminal
part of the alpha subunit and the C-terminal part of the
beta subunit, respectively. Strains 101P30B1 and
103P14B1 (type 2 region) harbored the same genes, but
the MCR_0737-ortholog contained an internal deletion,
and the MCR_0738-ortholog was found to be truncated.
The type 3 and 4 regions contained overlapping ORFs
that could encode the missing C-terminal part of the
alpha subunit and the missing N-terminal part of the
beta subunit, with a small size-difference in the latter
(Figure 9). The TCA cycle requires the supply of acetylCoA, which may be derived from the degradation of

Davie et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:70

the high degree of sequence homology shared between
these two adhesins makes an absolute accounting of
their presence challenging without a targeted sequencing
effort (see Discussion; [44,45]).

RH4, genes encoding the enzymes of the non-oxidative
branch of the pentose-phosphate shunt were present in

Distribution of M. catarrhalis Virulence Factors

A number of virulence factors have been described in
M. catarrhalis, ranging from cell-to-cell adhesins (Hag;
UspA1/2/2H; McaP; MchA1/A2) and inflammatory
mediators (LOS) to biofilm formation (type four pilus
(TFP); Recently reviewed in [41,6] and [3]). Each of the
genomes was assessed for the presence of known or
putative virulence factors (Additional File 2, Table S2).
Interestingly, with few exceptions, genes encoding all
known virulence factors were present in each strain.
While the presence of uspA2 or uspA2 H is mutually
exclusive, the extreme skew in genomes containing
uspA2 H is inconsistent with previous reports and
would appear to be the result of an automatic assembly
and/or annotation bias resulting from the repetitive
sequence cassettes that comprise these genes [42,43]. In
addition, the presence of mchA1/A2 is also considerably
more varied than the literature would suggest; however,

Discussion
In the present study, we report genome assemblies for
10 M. catarrhalis clinical isolates that exceed the criteria
established by the Human Microbiome Project for draft
genome sequences and illustrate that the sequencing of
each genome is practically complete [46]. Comparative
genomic analysis has revealed 2,383 orthologous
gene clusters, 74% of which are present in all strains
(Table 2). The remaining 26% are found among the
twelve genomes in an uneven distribution; 67% of the
628 distributed gene clusters are found in four or fewer
genomes (Figure 1). Figure 2 demonstrates that the core
genome size is unlikely to decrease substantially
with the sequencing of additional genomes; hence the
M. catarrhalis core has been essentially characterized.
Moreover, the finite supragenome model predicts that
>85% of the M. catarrhalis species supragenome is contained within these twelve strains, and that the vast
majority of additional genes to be found are likely to be
rare genes, present in less than 10% of strains. The
uneven nature of the distributed genome serves to highlight the diversity of this segment of the supragenome
and is consistent with the distributed genomes of
S. pneumoniae and the NTHi [20,21]. In contrast with
NTHi and S. pneumoniae, whose supragenomes are
divided almost evenly among the core and distributed
genomes, the division of these genomes in
M. catarrhalis is 3:1, respectively. Hiller et al. suggested
that the large size of the distributed genomes in S. pneumoniae and NTHi result, at least partially, from their
natural competency and ability to survive within the
human host in biofilms, forming a close proximity
environment in which genetic information could be
exchanged [21]. Despite sharing those two phenotypes
with S. pneumoniae and the NTHi, a given isolate of M.
catarrhalis shares 74% of its coding potential with every
other isolate, suggesting that some other mechanism(s)
function to constrain horizontal acquisition of genetic
information in this bacterium [1]. Horizontal gene transfer in H. influenzae via natural transformation is skewed
toward DNA from members of the Pasteurellaceae by
the use of uptake signal sequences (USS), which have
been recently suggested to facilitate the molecular drive
of family-specific DNA [47,48]. While S. pneumoniae
does not possess an USS, it does contain a stress-induced
competence system associated with the fratricidal secretion
of antibiotics that has been suggested to contribute to the
S. pneumoniae distributed genome [49]. However, no
system analogous to either of these has been reported in

Figure 9 Overview of variant regions encoding putative succinyl-CoA:3-oxo-acid CoA-transferase (SCOT) subunits in M. catarrhalis
strains. Four variant regions were identified: type-1 regions contain two ORFs encoding the N-terminal part of the alpha subunit and the Cterminal part of the beta subunit; type-2 regions hold the same ORFs but one with an internal deletion and one in a truncated form; type-3
regions have two sets of overlapping ORFs encoding the N-terminal (501 nt) and C-terminal part (198 nt) of the alpha subunit and the Nterminal (249 nt) or the C-terminal part (363 nt) of the beta subunit, respectively; type-4 regions are identical to type-3 regions except that the
ORF encoding the N-terminal part of the beta subunit is 273 nt in length.

M. catarrhalis. Instead, the smaller size of the M. catarrhalis distributed genome may be the result of genetic frugality; as M. catarrhalis, NTHi, and S. pneumoniae are
commonly present in polymicrobial infections, M. catarrhalis does not need to duplicate the coding potential of
these bacteria to benefit from the indirect pathogenicity
provided by the substantially more diverse supragenomes
of these species [20,21,50]. Support for a model of genomic
efficiency in M. catarrhalis is found in the recent observation that M. catarrhalis 7169, one of the twelve strains analyzed in this study, responds to autoinducer-2 signal
produced by the NTHi strain 86-028NP, substantially
increasing its already robust capacity to form a biofilm
[4,51]. Armbruster et al. posit that such a relationship with
NTHi is reciprocal as M. catarrhalis releases substantial
amounts of beta-lactamase into the local environment,
conferring beta-lactam resistance to other bacteria in close
proximity [51-55]. Furthermore, the work of Armbruster
et al. is consistent with the observation of Tan et al. that
M. catarrhalis and NTHi cooperate to avoid clearance by
components of the innate immune system [56]. Clearly,
further studies are warranted to explore this multispecies
interaction at the supragenome and population levels.
Interestingly, analysis of the 16 S rRNA sequence of all
strains indicated that they are type 1 isolates, which is
reported to predominately group within the sero-resistant
lineage (data not shown; [14]). Therefore, it is possible the
recent divergence of serum-resistant M. catarrhalis, estimated at 5 million years ago, may have limited the opportunity to acquire distributed genes in general and
virulence-specific factors in particular [16].

M. catarrhalis isolates possess a wide array of virulence
factors known or suspected of mediating pathogenesis
(reviewed in [3]). Interestingly, the vast majority of the
known/putative virulence factors of M. catarrhalis are
present in the core genome. This finding is instructive, as
it demonstrates that the large pool of conserved genes in
this species includes many of the most promising vaccine
candidates. In particular, these core virulence factors
include the type four pilus (TFP) and several adhesin-like
proteins, both of which are surface exposed [3,57]. In
particular, TFP and UspA1 have been demonstrated to
be important in biofilm formation ([4] and recently
reviewed in [3]). Notably, mchA1/2 sequences have been
completely sequenced in ATCC 43617, 7169, and O35E,
as well as identified by PCR product amplification in 16
additional M. catarrhalis isolates [44,45]. Despite this
high level of conservation, only eight out of twelve strains
in this study contained large partial ORFs homologous to
either mchA1 or mchA2. However, the absence of complete mchA1/2 sequences must be carefully interpreted;
mchA1 and mchA2 are 5.4 kb and 5.2 kb long, respectively, with 100% identity over the first 3.6 kb [44,45].
Furthermore, nine of twelve strains in the present study
contain the cognate two-partner secretion pore, mchB,
suggesting that these strains likely contain a functional
mchA1 and/or mchA2. Similar challenges were observed
with uspA2/2 H sequencing, as automatic annotation
resulted in the identification of fragmented sequences
corresponding to twelve uspA2 H homologs and no
uspA2 homologs. While expression of uspA2 and uspA2
H are exclusive of one another, the automatic PGAAP

Davie et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:70
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/70

annotation of the O35E and 7169 genomes incorrectly
identifies the uspA2 sequence fragments as uspA2 H [42].
The fragmented disposition of the uspA2 sequence
appears to have confounded the automated annotation
process, likely caused by the uspA1- and uspA2-homologous regions that characterize the hybrid nature of uspA2
H [43]. These long, repetitive sequence features collectively make it difficult for the automated assembly and
annotation programs to correctly characterize certain
HMW adhesins like mchA1/2 and uspA2/2 H from medium-read genome sequencing data. It should be noted
that the mchA genes were first identified in M. catarrhalis ATCC 43617, whose unpublished draft genome
sequence was determined using longer Sangersequencing reads [44,45]. Similarly, uspA1 and uspA2/2
H sequences were elucidated by traditional sequencing
methods [42,43].
The consistency with which virulence factors in particular, and most genes in general, are present within
each genome is remarkable. The general absence of
plasmid carriage in the sequenced M. catarrhalis isolates
is instructive and suggests that the processes of natural
transformation, phage- and transposon-mediated horizontal gene transfer serve as the primary means of
acquiring genic diversity in this species. The number
and sequence diversity of CRISPR elements present in
these isolates supports this premise and further suggests
that, as a species, M. catarrhalis is comes into contact
with a diverse population of bacteriophages and other
invading nucleic acids in the human host. While the
deviation in both CRISPR spacer number and spacer
consensus sequences suggests that these strains have
likely evolved independently of one another in terms of
the specific infectious agents and temporal distribution
of resistance events, a conclusive statement requires
additional analyses. Hansen and colleagues observed in
separate studies that the functional bacteriocin/immunity complex identified in pLQ510 is chromosomally
maintained in many isolates and the identification of a
putative conjugative plasmid/ICE containing this complex in the BC7 genome may represent another means
of shuttling genetic information between M. catarrhalis
isolates [24,26]. It is interesting to note that all genomes
possess at least one transposase from each of the IS4,
IS200, and IS1016 families that is present in a similar
chromosomal context in each strain, while 5 genomes
possess an additional IS605 family transposase. IS200
family transposases have been proposed as a sub-group
of the larger IS605 family and the most commonly
observed DNA re-arrangement mediated by IS200
family transposases are deletion mutations (Reviewed in
[58]). Additionally, IS200/605 transposases lack terminal
repeats, permitting them to repair the disrupted gene
faithfully without gene duplication upon excision, thus

Page 12 of 17

limiting the potential for the creation of novel and
potentially advantageous ORFs [58,59]. While IS4 elements utilize a similar “cut-and-paste” form of nonreplicative transposition, they do possess terminal
inverted repeats and can encourage gene duplication
upon excision (Reviewed in [60]). While IS1016 family
transposons are not found in all H. influenzae isolates,
they were first described in this species as a novel class
of compound transposon facilitating the amplification of
a polysaccharide capsule loci [61,62]; given their apparent ubiquitous distribution among M. catarrhalis genomes and the intimate relationship between these
two bacteria, it is possible that IS1016 originated in
M. catarrhalis and has only been recently acquired by
H. influenzae.
It is notable that, while the sequenced M. catarrhalis
isolates are nearly devoid of plasmid sequences and consistently display the same repertoire of transposons, the
distributed and core genomes show evidence of differential codon bias. Such differences are often the result of
the acquisition of foreign DNA (reviewed in [28]), but
the observations that 1) the distributed genome is predicted to be better suited than the core genome for optimal translation and 2) the limited number of sequences
suspected to be of foreign origin present in the M. catarrhalis supragenome suggest that a primary source of
genic diversity in this species may be the acquisition of
novel genetic elements that have arisen by mutation in
another strain of M. catarrhalis. Hence, the differences
in codon usage in the core and distributed genomes
may be due to differing rates of molecular evolution as
this pathogen continues its maturation. However, we
cannot rule out the possibility that the differences in
codon usage witnessed in the core and distributed genomes are the result of an unrecognized bias. Further
studies investigating the mutation rates of the core and
distributed genomes, as well as characterization of the
in vitro and in vivo transcriptomes, of multiple M. catarrhalis strains would be useful in characterizing the
evolution of this species.
In addition to characterizing the M. catarrhalis supragenome, we investigated the possibility that clinical isolates from patients with OM and COPD represented
two distinct populations with respect to chromosomal
organization and coding potential. As such, we evaluated
each strain at the genomic and genic levels. Multiple
and pair-wise whole genome alignments indicate that
M. catarrhalis isolates exhibit a high degree of chromosomal synteny and have undergone only limited largescale genome re-arrangement as a species (Figure 7).
Similarly, while a metabolic reconstruction analysis
revealed intriguing differences in the composition of
four variant loci encoding putative SCOT enzyme subunits, the lack of additional differences in the central

Davie et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:70
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/70

metabolic pathways of these isolates highlights the
nearly identical metabolic potential of the twelve analyzed strains (Figure 9 and Additional File 2, Table S2).
While the number of gene clusters present in the distributed genome increases as anticipated with concomitant increases in genome size, strains isolated from
COPD or OM patients do not trend toward either end
of the genome size spectrum. Furthermore, dendrograms generated using sequence data from the core and
distributed gene clusters revealed that the use of either
set of gene clusters had a demonstrable differential
effect on branch placement within each dendrogram
(Figure 3). Additionally, as neither dendrogram correlates with MLST type, geographic origin, patient age
group, disease type or SCOT loci variant, these data
illustrate the potential for a very minute number of
sequence differences to exert an undue bias in the
grouping of certain strains. This core/non-core-dependent variation in dendrogram topology is in discordance
with similar trees created from the core and distributed
genomes of NTHi and S. pneumoniae, where the use of
either data generated similar dendrograms ([20,21];
G. Ehrlich, unpublished). Taken together, the data presented in this study do not support a genomic differentiation between strains isolated from children and adults
and moreover suggest that most strains of
M. catarrhalis would be capable of causing either OM
or exacerbations of COPD.

Conclusions
This study describes the M. catarrhalis supragenome
and provides an in-depth characterization of twelve genomes, including ten sequenced expressly for this effort.
Comparative analyses revealed that all twelve isolates
are highly similar within the context of their virulence
and metabolic potential, CRISPR and mobile genetic element content, chromosomal synteny and gene content.
Interestingly, while the distribution of gene content
among strains is consistent with the DGH, the proportion of genes found in the core and distributed genomes
differs considerably with that reported for the OM and
COPD-associated pathogens S. pneumoniae and NTHi.
With nearly three-quarters of genes common to all isolates, including the vast majority of virulence-associated
genes, M. catarrhalis would appear especially suitable to
control via vaccination. It is also of substantial interest
that these studies do not reveal obvious genomic differences between isolates recovered from COPD and OM
patients, suggesting that, should a distinction exist, it
would be mediated by an extremely small number
of genes and/or mediated by an unrecognized epigenetic
mechanism. The data presented in this study
significantly increases our knowledge of M. catarrhalis
biology and these data could be instrumental in the

Page 13 of 17

development of novel antimicrobial treatments designed
to lessen the substantial individual, social and economic
burdens of COPD and OM.

Methods
DNA Sequencing

Genomic DNA was isolated from overnight cultures of
M. catarrhalis strains (Table 1) using the Genomic-tip
500/G kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as per manufacturers
instructions. Genome sequencing was performed using a
454 Genome Sequencer (Roche) using either GS-20 or
Titanium chemistries. Strain 7169 was sequenced by a
combination of 3-kb and 8-kb 454 Titanium paired-end
sequencing, while strains 12P80B1, 103P14B1 and
46P47B1 were subjected to 454 GS-20 whole genome
shotgun sequencing; all four strains were sequenced by
the Infectious Disease & Genomics Core facility at the
NYS Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Life
Sciences (University at Buffalo, SUNY). Strains BC1,
BC7, BC8, CO72, 101P30B1 and O35E were sequenced
by 454 Titanium whole genome shotgun sequencing at
the Center for Genomic Sciences at the AlleghenySinger Research Institute. All sequencing protocols and
chemistries used were performed as per manufacturers
instructions.
Draft Genome Assembly

Genomes were assembled using the Newbler assembly
program (v2.0.01.14 or later) and complete genome
assembly statistics are present in Table 1. Each genome
was sequenced to a high level of coverage (> 19x) and
each draft genome was evaluated by the high-quality
draft genome assembly criterion established by the
Human Microbiome Project consortium [46].
Accession Numbers and NCBI Project IDs

The genome sequences novel to this study have been
deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank and are denoted by
the following master accession numbers: AEPC00000000
(101P30B1), AERC00000000 (7169), AERE00000000
(103P14B1), AERF00000000 (46P47B1), AERG00000000
(12P80B1), AERH00000000 (BC1), AERI00000000
(BC7), AERJ00000000 (BC8), AERK00000000 (CO72)
and AERL00000000 (O35E). Accession numbers for
RH4 and ATCC 43617, as well as the version described
in this manuscript, are listed in Table 1.
Gene Identification and Gene Clustering

The assembled contig files were submitted to the
NCBI’s Prokaryotic Genomes Automatic Annotation
Pipeline (PGAAP) [63]. Putative gene sequences identified by this system were used in a clustering algorithm
implemented at the Center for Genomic Sciences. Each
gene’s nucleotide sequence was aligned against every

Davie et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:70
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/70

other gene nucleotide sequence from all twelve genomes. To account for sequences that were present in
the genome, but not identified by the automatic annotation, the amino acid sequence of each gene was aligned
against every nucleotide contig from all twelve genomes.
Alignments were done using either the threaded Fasta
or Tfasty program version 3.6 [64]. Genes were clustered together by comparing alignment scores. If a gene
matched at least one other gene in a cluster with 70%
identity, over 70% of the smaller gene length, it was
added to a cluster. For a more rigorous mathematical
reasoning of this threshold choice, see [20].
Neighbor Grouping Analysis

All genomes in this study were compared using a neighbor grouping analysis, as described [22]. Essentially,
after the gene clustering procedure, two sub-sets of gene
clusters were identified, a modified core, defined as a
gene cluster that had only one member from every
strain, and a modified distributed set, defined as a cluster which had fewer than all strains as a member, but
greater than just a single strain. Two grouping analyses
were done: creating a distance matrix from allelic differences in the modified core set, and a distance matrix
based on the genic presence/absence in the modified
distributed set. In short, genomes that shared high percent identities between core genes are “closer” or “less
distant” from one another in the allelic comparison.
Likewise, genomes that shared membership in many of
the same distributed gene clusters would also be more
closely related. Distance matrices and statistics were
computed using a custom perl implementation. Genomes whose distances from each other were less than
the total average distance minus the standard error were
grouped together. Trees were built from these matrices
using the Phylip Neighbor-Grouping software, with
default settings [65].
Finite Supragenome Model

Predictions for the number of genomes required for the
percent coverage of total genome size, novel gene clusters added per genome, and number of core gene clusters was computed via the method described in [20].
The only alteration made to the model was to allow
gene class population frequencies to vary; previously the
values were fixed.
MLST Analysis

Multi-locus sequence typing was inferred from the besthit homologs of glyRS (glycyl-tRNA synthetase beta subunit), ppa (pyrophosphate phospho-hydrolase), efp
(elongation factor P), fumC (fumarate hydratase), trpE
(anthranilate synthase component I), mutY (adenine glycosylase), adk (adenylate kinase) and abcZ (ATP-binding

Page 14 of 17

protein) present in each genome in compliance with the
M. catarrhalis MLST scheme developed previously [16].
Each homolog was used to query the M. catarrhalis
MLST database [66] to identify the sequence variant
(SV) number for each gene, as well as the composite
sequence type (ST). Phylograms were constructed using
the PHYLIP and Phylodendron packages implemented
at [67].
Whole Genome Alignment

Prior to whole genome alignment, contig sequences
from each of the eleven draft genome were ordered relative to the closed, completed RH4 chromosome using
the contig mover application (Mauve Package v2.3.1;
[38]). Pair-wise and multiple genome alignments were
performed with the progressiveMauve application
(Mauve Package v2.3.1). Both applications were run
with their default settings.
Codon Usage Analysis

Cumulative codon usage was calculated for the total M.
catarrhalis supragenome and the core and distributed
genomes using the GCUA software package (v1.2; [68]).
As this analysis is dependent on confident predictions of
start sites and in-frame translation, 908 of 21,960
sequences were excluded from GCUA analysis for meeting one or more of the following criteria: 1) presence of
internal stop codons, 2) incomplete final codons, 3)
unrecognized start codons and/or 4) the absence of
synonymous codon usage. The CodonW software package (v1.4; [69]) was used to calculate various codon usage
statistics using default settings. In order to prevent sample size-dependent bias during these calculations, one
sequence for each of the 2,383 gene clusters was computationally selected without human intervention for
further analysis. Of the 2,383 sequences selected, 142
were excluded from these analyses as they fulfilled the
exclusion criterion described previously. Inspection of
the reduced dataset identified a similar number of
sequences from each genome (data not shown).
Mobile Genetic Element Analysis

Phage and plasmid-derived genes were identified by
querying the PGAAP database entry of each genome for
phage or plasmid-associated annotation data. A gene
was determined to be phage or plasmid-associated if
annotations records contained the terms “phage”, “plasmid”, “transposon” or “Tn”.
CRISPR Analyses

Putative CRISPR elements were identified using
CRISPRFinder [70]. CRISPR elements were reported
only if CRISPRFinder determined these elements to be
of high confidence; possible CRISPR elements were not

Davie et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:70
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/70

included in these analyses. High confidence CRISPR elements were subjected to sequence homology analyses
using the MacVector package (v11.1.1; MacVector, Inc.,
Cary, NC) to ascertain homology.
Metabolic Reconstruction Analysis

Reconstruction of the central metabolic pathways of the
RH4 strain was performed as described [13]. Briefly,
KEGG orthology (KO) identifiers were assigned with the
web-based KEGG automatic annotation server (KAAS;
[71]) using the bidirectional best-hit method with the prokaryotic reference set. The central metabolic pathways of
all M. catarrhalis strains were compared to the RH4
genome [13] using the KO identifiers and PGAAP-based
comparative genomics data. For genes that appeared to be
missing in the initial PGAAP annotation, the respective
genomic regions were examined by additional GLIMMER
analysis [72] and manual inspection. Further, for genes
that were absent in RH4 [13,73], BlastN searches were
performed using coding sequences of bacterial species closely related to M. catarrhalis, namely Psychrobacter sp.,
Acinetobacter sp., and Neisseria sp.
Statistical Analysis

Pearson correlation analysis was utilized for comparisons of various data sets as denoted in the text. All statistical analyses were performed with Prism v4.0
(GraphPad Software, Inc).
