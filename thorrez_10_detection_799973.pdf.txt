Detection of novel 3’ untranslated region
extensions with 3’ expression microarrays

Abstract
Background: The 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) of transcripts are not well characterized for many genes and often
extend beyond the annotated regions. Since Affymetrix 3’ expression arrays were designed based on expressed
sequence tags, many probesets map to intergenic regions downstream of genes. We used expression information
from these probesets to predict transcript extension beyond currently known boundaries.
Results: Based on our dataset encompassing expression in 22 different murine tissues, we identified 845 genes
with predicted 3’UTR extensions. These extensions have a similar conservation as known 3’UTRs, which is distinctly
higher than intergenic regions. We verified 8 of the predictions by PCR and found all of the predicted regions to
be expressed. The method can be extended to other 3’ expression microarray platforms as we demonstrate with
human data. Additional confirming evidence was obtained from public paired end read data.
Conclusions: We show that many genes have 3’UTR regions extending beyond currently known gene regions and
provide a method to identify such regions based on microarray expression data. Since 3’ UTR contain microRNA
binding sites and other stability determining regions, identification of the full length 3’ UTR is important to
elucidate posttranscriptional regulation.

Background
The 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) of a gene does not
belong to the protein coding sequence, however it plays
an important role in posttranscriptional regulation [1].
This region of the transcript typically contains binding
sites for proteins and microRNAs which influence the
stability, localization and translation of the messenger
RNA [2]. Not only the presence of microRNAs and
RNA binding proteins themselves determines the
mRNA fate, but also the presence of their binding sites
on the transcript is critical for the specific regulation to
occur. Therefore it is important to identify the 3’ ends
of the transcript.
Delineation of the 3’ end of a transcript so far relied
on ESTs or high-throughput sequencing of full-length
cDNAs in various cell lines or in one specific tissue
[3,4]. Paired-End diTag (PET) analysis, during which
short fragments from both transcript ends are extracted,
concatenated and sequenced, possesses a unique

capability to accurately and efficiently characterize transcript boundaries. This approach was demonstrated on
2 human cancer cell lines [5]. However it has recently
been shown that 3’UTR length varies across tissues
types and is highly dependent upon cell division [6], so
many cell lines, which inherently are dividing cells, may
not express the full length 3’UTR. A direct consequence
is that many of the current annotations do not reflect
the potential full length 3’ UTR. Indeed, by use of
RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends), analyzing
both 5’ and 3’ ends and then hybridizing the products
to whole genome tiling arrays, it was recently demonstrated that, for most of the genes, there are RNAs that
extend well beyond known gene borders, often further
than three megabases away [7].
Affymetrix genechips are widely used microarray platforms to measure expression of thousands of transcripts
simultaneously. With this technology, mRNAs extracted
from the experimental sample are labeled and then
hybridized to 25 bp long probes [8]. During the array
design process [9], Affymetrix collected sequences and
annotations from various public databases including
GenBank, dbEST and RefSeq and clustered these

sequences. The longest sequence in each cluster was
used as the representative for that cluster, with preference given to RefSeq sequences. Pair-wise alignment of
the probe sequences against the non-redundant mRNA
cluster was used to assign probe sets to transcripts.
Each probe, through its specific 25 bp sequence, is
designed to target one transcript although for some
probes, cross-hybridization to other transcripts is
known. In order to get a better estimation of the expression level of a transcript, probes are grouped per 11
probe pairs, known as probe sets [10]. The signal of a
probe set is not only a factor of the transcript abundance, but also depends upon the position of the probe
set. At equal GC content, the more 3’ of a transcript the
probe set is designed, the higher the signal will be, since
the labeling protocol initiates with an oligo d(T) primer.
Therefore, probes have been designed to recognize the
3’ ends of transcripts, which comprises mostly the 3’
untranslated region. Affymetrix 3’ expression arrays
were designed years ago based on EST data, which at
that time were largely unannotated (e.g., June 2002 for
the mouse 430 2.0 array). Currently, many probe sets
are still not assigned to any RefSeq transcript while
their expression signal is clearly above the noise.
We developed a method which detects currently
unannotated probe sets that target putative extensions
of the known 3’ UTRs. This algorithm makes use of
expression data in many diverse tissues and can be
applied to any 3’ expression platform where such data
are available.

and then evaluates the next downstream probe set
whether or not it might target an extended transcript.
The analysis pipeline is depicted in Figure 1A. Only
probe set pairs are considered where the downstream
probe set binds the same strand and is not yet annotated to a RefSeq transcript. We removed 6808 probe
sets from the analysis because these map to multiple

Results
Mouse gene expression data

We have focused our analysis on the Affymetrix 430 2.0
mouse expression array (MOE430 2.0), since this is a
widely used platform, containing 45101 probe sets covering most of the known RefSeq transcripts. Our dataset
consists of 70 microarrays in total covering 22 different
murine tissues with 3-5 replicates per tissue. We covered a wide range of tissue types that included slow
dividing tissues such as brain cortex and eye as well as
fast dividing tissues such as small intestine and embryonic stem cells.
Of the 45101 probe sets, 5400 (12%) currently do not
correspond to any known RefSeq gene (august 2008),
but are expressed significantly above the noise level in
at least one of our arrays.
Computational screen for extended probe sets

As a starting point of our algorithm, RefSeq was chosen
because of the high quality curation and up-to-date
annotations. For each of the 21769 murine transcripts in
RefSeq, the algorithm detects the probe set located most
3’of the transcript (termed hereafter ‘primary probe set’)

Figure 1 Identification of unannotated extended probe sets. A.
At the core of this analysis is our murine mRNA expression
database comprising 22 different tissues. Unannotated probe sets
binding putative 3’ UTR extensions were identified as shown in the
flow chart. The number of RefSeq transcripts retained after each
filtering step is shown, finally resulting in 922 transcripts
corresponding to 845 unique gene symbols for which 3’ UTR
extensions are predicted. B. Histogram with Pearson’s correlations.
The red histogram depicts correlations between the 1849 probe set
pairs selected as shown in panel A. The blue histogram depicts
correlations between random pairs of probe sets from the same
microarray platform. As a cut-off for statistically significant coexpression, a Pearson correlation of 0.6 was chosen, resulting in an
estimated false positive rate of 2%.

locations on the mouse genome; this resulted in 38293
probe sets for further analysis. We identified 3141 transcripts which had a probe set pair. To eliminate correlations based on noisy expression, we only considered
probe sets which have a log2 expression signal >6 in at
least one array of the entire dataset. From the 3141
RefSeq transcripts, 1849 (59%) were found to be covered
by co-oriented probe sets which generated expression
signals above noise.
To determine consistent co-expression, we calculated
the Pearson correlation coefficients between the expression profiles for all probe set pairs retained thus far and
plotted the histogram (Figure 1B, red bars). To select a
statistically relevant threshold for Pearson correlation,
we generated Pearson correlation coefficients of pairs
randomly picked in the dataset that also have a signal
above the noise (blue bars). By choosing a correlation
cut-off value of 0.6, the right tail of the blue histogram
contains 2.18% of the random observations, which is the
estimated false positive rate. As an additional way to
estimate the false positive rate for each individual primary probe set, we calculated the correlation of this
probe set with all uniquely mapping probe sets on all
chromosomes except the chromosome to which the
probe set mapped. The stringent assumption being that
a correlation of two probe sets on different chromosomes represents a false positive (meaning that the transcript does not extend over different chromosomes). For
each probe set, correlations were calculated on average
over 27340 other probe sets. The percentage of probe
sets with a correlation >0.6 was 1.84% on average (median 1.32%), with a total interval ranging from 0.0228.60%, which is consistent with the previous false positive estimate.
Of the 1849 probe set pairs identified in the first step
of the analysis, 922 pairs (50%) had a Pearson coefficient
higher than 0.6. We mapped these 922 transcripts to
845 unique gene symbols. For genes with several transcript isoforms, we selected the transcript of which the
current annotation extended most 3’. These 845 genes
are listed in Additional file 1, Table S1. Taking into
account previous estimates, we expect between 15 and
18 out of 845 extended probe sets to be false positives.
As an example of probe set correlation, the log2
expression signals of probe sets 1416007_at and
1416008_at are shown in Figure 2A. 1416007_at is
annotated to target the 3’ end of a Satb1 (special ATrich sequence binding protein 1), whereas 1416008_at is
0.7 kb downstream of this gene and according to information displayed in the UCSC genome browser targets
an intergenic region (Figure 2B). It can be observed that
the expression signal of both probe sets is nearly identical, with only a consistent shift in expression signal
intensity over the different microarrays of various

tissues. The genomic space between the two probe sets
is very well conserved over mammals, which likely indicates the presence of functional regulatory regions. Such
conservation was observed for many of the predicted
3’UTR extended regions, as we demonstrate below. Of
interest, the predicted extension for Satb1 is in perfect
concordance with the occurrence of two polyA sites
after the current annotated end of the transcript [11].
The region between the annotated end and the extended
probe set (709 bp) contains the first polyA site and the
second polyA site is positioned immediately downstream
of the probe set. Since detection of the transcript usually
is better the closer a probe sets is relative to the 3’ end,
many of the extended probe sets provide better markers
for gene expression. An example of this is provided in
Additional file 2, Figure S1A, where the extended probe
set for gene D10Bwg1379e shows a clear expression signal in a number of samples which would be in the background range when using the annotated probe set.
In silico validation of predicted extensions

For a significant fraction of the extended 3’UTR probe
sets, we could find confirmation by gene prediction
methods. In Ensembl, a wide range of methods including ab initio gene predictions, homology and gene prediction hidden Markov models were used to make gene
predictions. These ‘Ensembl genes’ are regarded as being
accurate predicted gene structures with a low false positive rate, since they are all supported by experimental
evidence of at least one form via sequence homology
[12]. 197 of the probe sets detecting extended 3’UTRs
were residing in these regions predicted by Ensembl.
These genes are indicated in Additional file 1, Table S1
with an asterisk in the last column. An example is
shown for Lpin2, corresponding to the Ensembl predicted gene ENSMUST00000112649 (Additional file 2,
Figure S1B). Also, although not annotated as such by
RefSeq nor UCSC genes, 598 probe sets when queried
within NetAffx [13] (the online Affymetrix analysis center) were assigned to the genes we predicted. When this
information could be found, this was indicated next to
the probe set in Additional file 1, Table S1.
A consequence of the existence of extended 3’UTR
transcripts is that probe sets which were thought of
binding at the 3’ end may bind more upstream of the
transcript. Labeling efficiency of Affymetrix 3’ expression arrays decreases as a function of distance from the
polyA tail and thus the signal of such a probe set may
be relatively low and not meet our expression signal
threshold. Therefore we also looked at consecutive
probe set pairs where the secondary probe set met the
expression criterion while the primary did not and
where probe sets had a Pearson correlation exceeding
0.6. This resulted in an additional 44 probe sets

putatively targeting extended transcripts. As an example,
expression profiles of probe set 1439965_at, downstream
of probe set 1456940_at targeting Slc43a2 are depicted
in Additional file 2, Figure S1C. It can be observed that
the downstream probe set (although by current knowledge thought to be targeting intergenic sequence) has
higher expression values than the gene-targeting probe
set. However, since the false positive rate will be higher
in this set of probe sets due to more noisy expression
data, we chose not to include these in our list of putatively extended probe sets.
The distance between the extended probe sets and the
primary probe set ranged from 76 base pairs to 500 kb.
The distribution of the distances is shown in Additional
file 3, Figure S2. The majority of the extensions (600/
845) were less then 2 kb. However, a small fraction (39/
845 = 5%) of the probe set pairs was more than 10 kb
apart. Most likely, correlated probe sets located far away
on the genome arise from a 3’UTR which has been
spliced. Splicing over longer genomic distances has been
described [7]. A remote possibility exists that a correlation between two consecutive probe sets was caused by a
hitherto unknown gene located downstream of the putatively extended gene that would have a similar expression
profile. To exclude as much as possible regions that get
spliced out, motif finding was limited to the predictions
for extended regions <1 kb (n = 338). In order to classify
the extended regions as either 3’ UTR or intergenic
sequence, we looked for motif enrichment of 3’UTRs versus intergenic regions. We scanned for two types of
known stability elements: C-rich and AU-rich stability
elements and for 2 types of polyA elements: the classical
mammalian and the cytoplasmic polyA element. In addition, we investigated the number of microRNA binding
sites predicted by the Targetscan algorithm [14]. For the
microRNA target prediction, conservation scores were
not taken into account. For both known 3’UTR regions
and intergenic regions, 100 random datasets were generated containing the same amount of sequence as the
extended regions. Results are shown in Additional file 4,
Table S2. Based on occurrence of these motifs, we were
not able to discriminate known 3’UTRs from intergenic
sequence. Therefore these data could not be used to confirm the predictions for the extended regions.
We could however discriminate 3’UTR regions from
intergenic regions based on phylogenetic conservation
scores. Conservation scores were calculated with the
PhastCons method based on the multiple alignments of
20 placental mammalian genomes. PhastCons utilizes a
hidden Markov model which estimates the probability
that each nucleotide belongs to a conserved element
and is effective for picking out conserved elements [15].
For each of the 100 sets (known 3’UTR and intergenic
sequence) an average conservation score was calculated.

Page 5 of 11

Results are depicted in Figure 2C. Intergenic regions are
poorly conserved, with an average conservation score of
0.124, while 3’ UTRs display a more elevated conservation with an average of 0.233. Average conservation of
the predicted extensions was 0.26, which clearly is outside the range of our 100 set of intergenic sequences
(min 0.108 - max 0.152), but well within that of the
known 3’ UTRs (min 0.202 - max 0.286). With a normal
distribution Z-statistic, we therefore propose that the
predicted 3’ UTR extensions are similar to the known 3’
UTRs with p < 0.0001 (taken from the intergenic
distribution).
Wet lab validation of predicted extensions

To confirm the existence of the predicted 3’UTR extensions, we performed PCR assays with specific primer pairs
amplifying the known 3’ UTR and the extended 3’UTR.
Primer pairs were designed such that the forward primer
was common for the annotated and extended 3’UTR and
we assured that at least one intron was present inside the
amplified fragment, to exclude amplification of genomic
DNA. A general design of this experiment is depicted in
Figure 3A. We randomly chose eight genes with a predicted 3’UTR extension less than 1 kb for this validation
and performed PCR on both liver and muscle cDNA.
Results are shown in Figure 3. For all eight genes, we
could verify expression of the extended 3’UTR as all of the
long PCR fragments displayed a PCR fragment. The fragments corresponded to the expected lengths, except for
one gene (Riok2) where the long fragment was much
shorter than expected. For two genes (Mmp15 and Ocln),
expression of both fragments was only detected in liver,
which was consistent with a low expression value on the
microarray (data not shown). Also, for some genes (Isoc1,
Olfml1, Mmp15) next to the main fragment, a smaller and
less abundant fragment was detected, which is likely to
reflect minor splice variants. To verify that PCR products
originated from the intended regions, we sequenced the
PCR products from Olfml1 and Riok2. Sequencing
revealed multiple alternative splicing products for both the
known and extended 3’UTR of Olfml1 as shown in Additional file 5, Figure S3. Also, the shorter size of the Riok2
extended 3’UTR was confirmed to be due to an alternative
splicing event, resulting in a 282 bp long fragment instead
of the predicted 1256 bp.
Cross-species application

The currently proposed method to predict 3’ UTR
extensions may be easily adapted to other microarray
platforms. As a proof of principle, we applied the
method we used for mouse 430 2.0 arrays to a dataset
consisting of normal human tissue microarrays. A publicly available set of 64 Affymetrix U133 Plus2.0 arrays
was used in a manner analogous to the murine tissue

Figure 3 Detection of transcripts containing the predicted 3’UTR extension. A. Schematic overview of the validation PCR setup. For each of
the eight tested genes, two primer pairs were designed with the forward primer in common. The reverse primer was binding either within the
known 3’ UTR region (reverse short) or in the predicted extension (reverse long). Amplified regions were termed S (short) or L (long), respectively
and the expected size of these fragments for each of the genes is displayed below. In case of false positive prediction, no PCR fragment is
expected for the L fragment, since the reverse long primer then has no template to bind to. Contamination of genomic DNA was excluded
because primer pairs were spanning at least one intron. B. Results of PCR amplification visualized by gel electrophoresis. For each gene, four
lanes represent amplification of the short and long fragment in two tissues: liver and muscle. Next to these four lanes a size marker was

set. RefSeq contains 31270 human transcripts, of which
4662 are targeted by at least one probe set on the array
and have an unannotated downstream probe set in the
same orientation. After applying the expression threshold, 2126 probe sets pairs were retained. The Pearson
correlation graph was similar to the murine data (Figure
1B, Additional file 6, Figure S4A), so a correlation
threshold of 0.6 was applied resulting in a final prediction of 627 extended 3’ UTR regions. The 627 human
genes and probe set pairs are listed in Additional file 7,
Table S4. On the set of 162 regions smaller than 1 kb,
conservation scores were calculated with PhastCons
based on the multiple alignment of 17 vertebrate species. Results are depicted in Additional file 6, Figure
S4B. Similar to the murine data, conservation of the predicted extensions (average 0.2481) is clearly higher than
intergenic sequence (average 0.082 ranging from 0.059
to 0.115) and even a little higher than known 3’ UTR
regions (average 0.188 ranging from 0.140 to 0.231). As
a validation, we looked at transcript delineation by
experimental evidence. The Gene Identification Signature Paired End diTag (GIS-PET) method provides
sequence information from tags at both the 5’ and 3’
end of a transcript. Data from GIS-PET experiments on
human embryonic stem cells and a few cell lines can be
visualized and downloaded from the UCSC genome
browser. An example of this is shown for Afg3l2 in
Additional file 6, Figure S4C. Tags can be seen where
the RefSeq transcript ends, but also downstream of this.
The extended probe set targets the region in between,
which is a highly conserved region. Of the 162
sequences < 1 kb, 65 (40%) were confirmed by tags
mapping on the target region of the extended microarray probe set or even further downstream.

Discussion
It was suggested previously that Affymetrix GeneChips
have the potential to be used as a discovery tool for
exploring the exotic transcriptome, and go beyond
their standard use as a measure of mRNA for proteincoding genes [16]. In this work, we have developed a
method to use 3’UTR targeted expression arrays to
investigate the current annotations of 3’ ends. We
looked at unannotated probe sets downstream of annotated genes and compared the expression profiles of
both probe sets over a large set of arrays from different murine tissues. With this approach, we found that
845 murine genes display expression downstream of
the RefSeq annotation. Some of these genes have been
studied extensively before but sparse evidence of an
extended 3’UTR could be found in the literature. One
example is the gene that encodes the GLP1-receptor
(Glp1r), for which Northern blot experiments resulted
in two distinct mRNA lengths [17].

The finding of 3’UTRs extending further than currently
annotated has important implications for data analysis.
First, Affymetrix 3’ expression probe sets have been
designed within 600 bp of 3’ ends, to ensure an efficient
labeling. An important consequence of the unknown
extended 3’UTRs is that the probe set which was previously thought to be close to the 3’ end might not give a
high signal since the real 3’ end is further away and thus a
lower labeling efficiency occurred. This was possibly the
case for the additional 44 probe sets which we found correlated but where the signal generated with the proximal
probe set was too low for inclusion in the dataset. Therefore, transcripts where only the annotated (proximal)
probe set is considered, might give false negative results,
attributed to low expression, but in fact caused by the
extended 3’UTR. Extended probesets detecting longer
3’UTRs may provide a higher expression signal, but have
an increased chance to give a background signal in the
case the transcript is alternatively terminated. However, as
for the current set of predictions, alternative termination
is unlikely in the majority of the samples, since the
extended probesets are selected based on a good coexpression profile with the primary probesets. If alternative termination would occur commonly, the extended probeset
would not be retained in this analysis. The extended probe
sets we describe in this paper are thus more reliable markers for measuring expression of such genes in conditions
where the full length 3’ UTR is used.
Second, exon arrays are increasingly used to capture variation by alternative termination and alternative splicing.
However, probes for these exon arrays have been mainly
designed in the regions of the currently known exons. As
a result, information on extended 3’UTRs, such as the
ones described in this paper may not be obtained.
Third, microRNA target sites have been shown to be
enriched towards the end of the 3’UTR [18,19]. Therefore, incomplete 3’ UTR annotations may obscure an
important fraction of microRNA binding sites.
Knowledge of the full 3’UTR sequence is not only
important from a data analysis perspective but is also
clinically relevant. It has been estimated that 3’ UTRs
are associated with about 0.2% of known disease-associated mutations [20] and it was noted that “this number is likely a conservative estimate, especially since it is
emerging that the boundaries of this regulatory region
are still unknown for many genes in various tissues”.
Mutations in the 3’ UTR region have been associated
with many diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus [21,22], spastic paraplegia [23] and cardiomyopathy
[24]. A naturally occurring trinucleotide insertion in the
3’UTR of mouse tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf)
mRNA has been shown to hinder RNA-binding proteins, thereby reducing mRNA stability [25]. Mice carrying this polymorphism have macrophages that are low

producers of TNFalpha protein when stimulated with
interferon gamma, highlighting the physiological importance of 3’UTR elements and their control of mRNA
stability. Not only mutations, but also alternative splicing in the 3’UTR can lead to disease as was described
for the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome[26]. Alternative splicing is not necessarily linked to disease though, e.g. differential splicing within the 3’UTR of Col17a1 (type
XVII collagen) produces two mRNA transcripts that differ 610 nucleotides in length in normal keratinocytes
[27]. Expression of different transcripts coding for the
same protein but varying in 3’UTR composition can also
be used by the cell to control protein levels. Indeed this
has been described for b-catenin (Ctnnb1), which has 3
mRNA splice variants that differ solely in their 3’UTRs
due to alternative splicing or retaining of an intron [28].
Length of 3’UTR also provides translational control during developmental processes such as stem-cell proliferation, sex determination, neurogenesis and erythropoiesis
[29]. Another consequence of the extended transcripts is
that genes in a tail-tail orientation may overlap with
their 3’UTR in an even greater number of cases than
currently known. The function of many overlaps is antisense regulation and this occurs preferentially in 3’
UTRs [30].
The number of genes described in this paper which
have a longer 3’UTR than currently known is likely an
underestimation for several reasons. First, it is dependent
on probe sets designed by Affymetrix, which was based
on limited EST information. Out of 21769 transcripts,
16592 have one probe set targeting the 3’ UTR and only
3141 (14%) have another probe set targeting its putative
extension. Second, we rely on a good concordance of
probe set expression. Since our method selects only
those probe sets which have a high correlation over 70
samples, we most likely did not detect many extended
3’UTRs which occur in just a few tissues.
We investigated the regulatory potential of the
extended regions. To minimize the inclusion of intronic
sequence, only extensions <1 kb away from the primary
annotated probe set were considered for motif counting.
However, based on counting of predicted stability elements, polyA signals or microRNA hits, we were not
able to discriminate known 3’UTRs from intergenic
sequence. Therefore occurrence of these motifs was not
informative to classify the predicted extensions as
3’UTR or intergenic sequence. Next, we looked into
evolutionary conservation of 3’UTRs versus intergenic
sequences. Higher conservation scores can be observed
in 3’UTR regions as compared to intergenic regions.
This is logical because genomic changes in intergenic
regions likely have less impact on selection than changes
in genes. We found evidence of conservation of the predicted extended regions similar to that of known

Page 8 of 11

3’UTRs, indicating that these regions have functional
importance.
Most importantly, wet lab validation of 8 predicted
extensions confirmed all of the in silico predictions.
This is consistent with our prediction of the false positive rate (2%). For all of the extensions except one, we
found the exact predicted lengths of PCR fragments in
at least one tissue. As an exception, Riok2 had a region
spliced out of the predicted extension, such that the
final length of the extended 3’UTR was shorter than the
known 3’UTR, which was confirmed by sequencing.
Detailed sequencing analysis also revealed multiple alternative splicing products for the Olfml1 3’UTR.
Provided that large enough datasets of different tissues
are available, this method can easily be applied to other
microarray platforms. We demonstrated this by applying
the method that we worked out for our own mouse
microarray compendium to a publicly available human
dataset. Using this approach, we identified 627 genes
with putative extended 3’UTRs. Similar to mouse
extended regions, these were also evolutionary conserved
regions, clearly different from intergenic regions. Moreover, 40% of the regions <1 kb were confirmed by GISPET tags, which are short sequence tags derived from the
beginning and end of a transcript. This figure is surprisingly high, since we expect only a subset of genes to be
expressed in the cells used for these experiments (MCF7
and embryonic stem cells) and moreover, it is known
that proliferating cells tend to express mRNAs with shortened 3’ UTRs [6]. By sensitive detection of polyadenylation sites of genes in the ENCODE region encompassing
1% of the human genome, a large number of transcripts
with 3’ ends in introns or extragenic regions was
detected, consistent with our observations [31].

Conclusions
We established a method to investigate the 3’UTR
extensions based on abundantly available microarray
data. In our own mouse mRNA expression data set we
observed that for 845 genes the 3’ UTR was longer than
annotated in Refseq. As the length of 3’ UTR determines
the regulatory elements which are present in the transcript, we believe that our observations have implications for the timing and amount of protein eventually
synthesized. Knowledge of the full length of the 3’UTRs
is therefore indispensable to fully understand posttranscriptional control.
Methods
The expression dataset consisting of 70 microarrays covering 22 different murine tissues with 3-5 replicates per
tissue was used as starting data. Data are accessible
through the GEO database, with accession number
GSE9954 [32]. The CEL files were analyzed using the affy

Thorrez et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:205
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/205

library [33] of the BioConductor project [34] applying the
Robust Multichip Average (RMA) function with default
parameters (RMA background correction, probe-level
quantile normalization and average difference summarization). During the normalization process, data were log2
transformed, and all further data analysis was performed
on these log2 transformed data. As a threshold for
expression above background, we used log2 (expression)
>6 (expression signal > 64) in at least 1 array. This is a
conservative estimate since about half of all expression
values on every array are lower (data not shown).
Affymetrix annotation files for the MOE430 2.0 array
were downloaded from NetAffx. Mouse genomic
sequences and chromosomal coordinates were obtained
from the UCSC Genome Browser [35] through the
Galaxy software [36] using the UCSC July 2007 mm9
assembly, based on the NCBI Build 37. The affy package
[33] from Bioconductor (version 2.1) [34] running under
R (version 2.6.2) was used for the microarray data processing. Our algorithm is written in Perl (version 5.8.5)
and is available upon request.
Sequence analysis for motif enrichment was performed
with Perl. Motifs scanned for were: C-Rich Stability Element: YCCA 0...5 CCCW Y{0,4} TCYCC, AU-rich Stability
Element: UAUUUAUWW, Cytoplasmic PolyA Element:
UUUUAU 1.100 AAUAAA and Mammalian PolyA Element: A(A|U)UAAA 12.40 KKKKKKKKKK [5,0,0]. These
motif descriptions were obtained from Transterm [37].
Scanning for predicted microRNA binding sites was performed with the Targetscan algorithm [14]. The sets containing known 3’UTRs and known intergenic sequences
were obtained via Galaxy [38]. Conservation scores were
extracted in Galaxy, selecting the phastCons30wayPlacental
table (mouse) or phastCons17way (human) for the desired
regions. Per set, averages of conservation scores were calculated. Screenshots were taken from the UCSC genome
browser [35] and edited in Adobe Illustrator.
Sequences of PCR primers are shown in Additional file
8, Table S4. PCR was performed in a 25 μl volume with
0.2 μl Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) in Platinum Taq buffer,
300 nM primers (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 ng cDNA, 200 μM
nucleotide mix (Fermentas) and 1.5 mM MgCl2 (Invitrogen). cDNA was prepared from the liver and gastrocnemius muscle of male C57Bl6 mice. Thermal cycling was
performed on a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied
Biosystems), 2’ 94°C - 38 × (20” 94°C - 30” 60°C - 3’ 72°C)
- 10’ 72°C - 4°C. Fragments were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized with SYBRSafe dye (Invitrogen),
together with a Generuler DNA ladder (Fermentas). PCR
products for Olfml1 and Riok2 were cut out from the gel,
purified and sent out for sequencing to Makrogen.
Sequences were aligned to the mouse genome by BLAT.
Normal human tissue data were retrieved from the
Human Body Index (GSE7307, Neurocrine Bioscience,

Page 9 of 11

San Diego, California), of which a subset of 64 arrays
were used, covering 18 different tissues with 3-5 replicates analogous to the murine dataset. Data were processed as described for the murine dataset.
Additional file 1: Table S1: List of Affymetrix mouse MOE 430 2.0 probe
sets detecting extended 3’UTRs, obtained by stringent automated
identification. Some probe sets were already predicted by Ensembl to
target the extended 3’UTR, based on the presence of a longer human
3’UTR with high homology in the extended part. These probe sets are
marked with an × in the appropriate column. Probe sets which are
correctly annotated in Affymetrix’ NetAffx are also indicated.
Additional file 2: Figure S1: Examples of correlated probesets. A.
Extended probe set 6 kb downstream of D10Bwg1379e gives better
signals than the currently annotated probe set. Transcriptional direction
is from right to left (negative strand). B. Confirmation of our extended
probe sets by Ensembl gene predictions. Lpin2 is displayed with the
RefSeq annotation (blue) and the Ensembl gene prediction (red).
Transcriptional direction is from left to right (positive strand). C.
Expression profiles of a probe set pair where the primary probe set has a
low expression (log2expression <6) in all arrays. We found 44 similar
cases on a genome-wide basis, but these were not retained for further
downstream analysis in this study. Transcriptional direction of Slc43a2 is
from left to right (positive strand).
Additional file 3: Figure S2: Histogram of the distances between the
primary and extended probe sets. The majority of predicted 3’ UTR
extensions are less than 2 kb. The graph is truncated at 10 kb but 5% of
extensions are in the range of 10-500 kb.
Additional file 4: Table S2: Occurrence of 3’UTR regulatory elements in
the murine extended regions. Regions currently not annotated by Refseq
to be part of the 3’UTR and < 1 kb were scanned for the occurrence of
several known motifs. To classify predicted extensions as either 3’ UTR or
intergenic sequence, we repeated this analysis on 100 datasets of the
same size randomly extracted from either known 3’UTR sequences or
intergenic sequence. Each set contained 214657 bp. 95% confidence
intervals are shown.
Additional file 5: Figure S3: Sequencing analysis of Olfml1 PCR
products. Both S (short, known 3’UTR) and L (long, extended 3’UTR)
products revealed 3 different alternative splicing forms, indicated as S1S3 and L1-L3. S1 and L1 are most abundant as can be seen on Figure
3B. Note that all sequencing products start more upstream in the last
but one exon of Olfml1; this region is not depicted and only the
alignment with the 3’UTR is shown.
Additional file 6: Figure S4: Detection of extended 3’ UTRs on the
Affymetrix human U133 Plus 2.0 platform. A. Histogram with
Pearson’s correlations for human expression data. The red histogram
depicts correlations between the 2126 probe set pairs before the final
filtering step. The blue histogram depicts correlations between random
probe sets. Similar to the mouse data, a Pearson correlation of 0.6 was
chosen as a cut-off value. B. Human conservation score graphs,
calculated with PhastCons based on the multiple alignment of 17
vertebrate species. Distributions in red and green represent intergenic
and 3’ UTR conservation respectively. Black arrow indicates the
conservation score of the extended regions. C. GIS-PET track in the UCSC
genome browser. GIS-PET tags are displayed in blue. Target regions for
the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 are indicated in black, PhastCons
conservation score indicated in green.
