West Nile virus (WNV) is a flavivirus (Flaviviridae
family) and its transmission cycle involves Culex spp.
mosquitoes and birds as reservoirs host whereas humans
and horses are dead-end hosts. Clinical symptoms of
WN human infections range from asymptomatic or
mild influenza like disease to severe neurological and
meningoencephalitis syndromes.
West Nile is a neglected emerging disease with major
breakthrough in 1999 with the introduction of WN
virus (WNV) in New York City and the subsequent
spread to whole northern America over the last decade
causing massive human and animals infection leading to
some fatal cases. In Eastern Europe, circulation of WNV
with recurrent emergences impacting human and animal
health since 1996 is similar to the situation in the USA.
Strikingly, in Africa WN appears to have a minor effect
despite regular isolations from mosquitoes and vertebrates hosts. In addition, WNV exhibited a great diversity with eight different lineages among which only one
(lineage 1) is found worldwide and 4 are present in
Africa.
In order to understand factors underlying the different
patterns of transmission and processes involved in the
emergence of WN in the different contexts, genetic
diversity, phylodynamics and vectorial competence of
WNV have been studied in Africa. Phylogenetic analysis
based on partial and complete genome suggests an
interconnection of zoonotic amplifications in Africa
with emergence in Europe as well as replacement
between lineages over time. Vectorial competence of
lineages circulating in Africa for a domestic mosquitoes

Culex quinquefasciatus showed significant differences
between strains of various lineages tested for infections,
dissemination and transmission rates. Indeed the different strains can be classified as low, intermediary and
high infection profile. Analysis of the transmission patterns with sequences of the strains suggest that glysoylation of the envelope protein of WNV, a key player in
the virus entry in the cell, may play an important role.
The implications of our findings are discussed in the
context of global emergence of WN.
