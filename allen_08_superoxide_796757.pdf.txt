Abstract
Background: Sarcoidosis is an idiopathic granulomatous disease with pathologic and immunologic
features similar to tuberculosis. Routine histologic staining and culture fail to identify infectious agents. An
alternative means for investigating a role of infectious agents in human pathogenesis involves molecular
analysis of pathologic tissues for microbial nucleic acids, as well as recognition of microbial antigens by the
host immune system. Molecular analysis for superoxide dismutase A (sodA) allows speciation of
mycobacteria. SodA is an abundantly secreted virulence factor that generates cellular immune responses
in infected hosts. The purpose of this study is to investigate if target antigens of the sarcoidosis immune
response can be identified by molecular analysis of sarcoidosis granulomas.
Methods: We detected sodA amplicons in 12 of 17 sarcoidosis specimens, compared to 2 of 16 controls
(p = 0.001, two-tailed Fisher's exact test), and 3 of 3 tuberculosis specimens (p = 0.54). Analysis of the
amplicons revealed sequences identical to M. tuberculosis (MTB) complex, as well as sequences which were
genetically divergent. Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 12 of the 17 sarcoidosis
subjects, we performed enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) to assess for immune recognition of
MTB sodA peptides, along with PBMC from 26 PPD- healthy volunteers, and 11 latent tuberculosis
subjects.
Results: Six of 12 sarcoidosis subjects recognized the sodA peptides, compared to one of 26 PPDcontrols (p = 0.002), and 6/11 PPD+ subjects (p = .68). Overall, 10 of the 12 sarcoidosis subjects from
whom we obtained PBMC and archival tissue possessed molecular or immunologic evidence for sodA.
Conclusion: Dual molecular and immunologic analysis increases the ability to find infectious antigens. The
detection of Th-1 immune responses to sodA peptides derived from molecular analysis of sarcoidosis
granulomas reveals that these are among the target antigens contributing to sarcoidosis granulomatous
inflammation.

Background
Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown etiology, characterized pathologically by noncaseating granulomas that
most commonly involve the lung, skin, lymph nodes and
eyes [1]. Syndromes with similar pathologic and immunologic features to sarcoidosis such as chronic beryllium
disease [2], hypersensitivity pneumonitis [3], and tuberculosis [4] indicate that granulomatous diseases may or
may not have an infectious etiology. Recently, several
reports from independent laboratories have associated
mycobacteria with sarcoidosis immunopathogenesis.
One report of molecular analysis of sarcoidosis granulomas revealed the presence of multiple mycobacterial
genes [5]. Humoral immune responses to Mycobacterium
katG and heat shock proteins by sarcoidosis subjects [6,7]
as well as the detection of these proteins in sarcoidosis
granulomas have been reported [6,8]. Most recently, a
report of Th-1 immune responses to mycobacterial antigens from sarcoidosis subjects added further support to
the hypothesis that mycobacterial antigens may have a
role in sarcoidosis pathogenesis [9].
Superoxide dismutase A (sodA) is a virulence factor
secreted in large quantities by pathogenic Mycobacterium
and Nocardia species, converting oxygen free radicals generated by host macrophages to hydrogen peroxide [10].
M. tuberculosis encodes two superoxide dismutases (SOD),
an iron-cofactored enzyme (sodA) and a copper-zinc
enzyme (sodC) [11]. Strong immune responses are elicited against sodA in tuberculosis-infected mice [12].
Molecular analysis of the sodA gene identifies Mycobacterium species [13]. The purpose of this study is to assess if
molecular analysis of sarcoidosis granulomas will reveal
microbial virulence factors which can induce Th-1
immune responses in the same subjects. Taking advantage
of the capability of molecular analysis of sodA to identify
Mycobacterium species, as well as the ability of sodA to
generate strong immune responses, we conducted molecular analysis for the presence of Mycobacterium sodA in
sarcoidosis granulomas, followed by immunologic assessment for Th-1 immune responses to sodA peptides in the
same sarcoidosis subjects.

Methods
Recruitment of study participants
This study was approved by the Vanderbilt University
Institutional Review Board for human studies, and
informed written consent was obtained from the study
participant or their surrogates, if required. All sarcoidosis
subjects from the available patient database of the Vanderbilt University Pulmonary Clinic or members of the
Middle Tennessee Sarcoidosis Support Group were
invited to participate in the study. For inclusion in this
study, the following criteria were used for patients with
sarcoidosis: 1) clinical features of acute respiratory illness

http://respiratory-research.com/content/9/1/36

accompanied by erythema nodosum, hilar adenopathy
and arthritis [Lofgren's syndrome], or indolent progressive pulmonary decompensation associated with radiographic
findings,
such
as
hilar
adenopathy,
reticulonodular infiltrates, or pulmonary fibrosis); 2) histopathologic features had confluent noncaseating granulomas, well circumscribed within the surrounding tissue
with a variable amount of peripheral lymphocytic infiltration [4]); 3) known microbial causes for granulomata had
to be excluded (i.e., specimens were negative for microorganisms by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), fungal, acid
fast bacilli (AFB), and auramine-O stains and on routine
bacterial, fungal, and AFB cultures). Frozen or paraffinembedded archival specimens from 21 sarcoidosis subjects were obtained; four were excluded due to the lack of
granulomatous involvement on the slide or pathology
inconsistent with the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, which left
17 specimens for molecular analysis. Nineteen frozen or
paraffin-embedded control specimens were obtained
from the archives of Vanderbilt Pathology Department, or
the Cooperative Human Tissue Network: three tuberculosis specimens and 16 negative control specimens of infectious and non-infectious etiologies. All sarcoidosis and
control specimens had their diagnostic slides independently confirmed by a pathologist.
For the enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT), we
were able to collect blood on 12 of the 17 sarcoidosis subjects. Due to the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) regulations, we could
not contact the negative or positive control subjects of
whom we had archival tissues. We invited 26 PPD negative (PPD-) healthy volunteers to participate as negative
controls for the ELISPOT analysis. The PPD- volunteers
had undergone PPD testing by the Vanderbilt employee
health services. Subjects with latent tuberculosis (PPD+)
were invited as positive controls, and had written documentation of their PPD status with no evidence of active
disease at the time of study enrollment. Approximately
60% of the sarcoidosis, PPD- and PPD+ subjects had participated in a previous investigation of immune responses
to mycobacterial antigens [14].
DNA extraction of archival tissue
For each sarcoidosis and control specimen, the original
paraffin-embedded tissue block was retrieved from the
archives if available. From each block, we cut a single 5
μm section that was stained with H&E to confirm the
pathology and demarcate areas of granulomatous
involvement; another ten 10 μm sections were cut, three
of which were used for extraction of DNA, and the
remaining seven sections were stored for future analysis.
The specimens were randomly processed for slide preparation. For each section from patients with sarcoidosis
and for the control specimens, granulomata were macro-

dissected and extracted with disposable surgical blades.
For the control specimens without granulomata, all tissue
from three 10 μm sections was used for DNA extraction.
For the frozen specimens, 25 mg of frozen sarcoidosis or
control specimens were initially minced with sterile disposable surgical blades prior to overnight proteinase K
digestion. For all specimens, DNA was extracted with the
QIAGEN DNAeasy extraction kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA)
according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the
exception of the following changes: 1) 60 μL of proteinase
K was used at a concentration of 20 mg/mL; 2) after the
overnight digestion, 0.5 mm glass beads (Biospec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK) were added to the completely
digested tissue, which was subsequently vortexed for 45
seconds; 3) the DNA was eluted with 100 μL of Buffer AE,
instead of 200 μL.
Tissue dissection and DNA preparation were performed in
a dedicated clean room, which was separate from the
rooms used for PCR analysis and sequencing. The
extracted DNA was stored at -80°C. Groups of tissue specimens from patients with sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and
controls were processed in parallel during all steps of the
procedure, including extraction of the DNA, amplification
and detection of mycobacterial DNA, and sequence analysis. The clinical diagnosis of each specimen was blinded
throughout the entire analysis.
Real-time PCR and sequence analysis
Six overlapping primer sets that cover the entire ORF for
Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex sodA (GenBank
No. AF061030) were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) and are
described in Table 1. Real-time PCR, performed with
SYBR Green I double-stranded binding dye (Applied Biosystems), and dissociation curve analysis were carried out
according to the manufacturer's protocol on the ABI Prism

http://respiratory-research.com/content/9/1/36

7000 Sequence Detection System. The quality of DNA
extracted from each clinical specimen was assessed by
screening for human beta actin, using the primers F 5'ACCGAGCGCGGCTACAG-3' and R 5'-CTTAATGTCACGCACGATTTCC-3'. Human beta actin was amplified from
all 36 clinical specimens. For each analysis, two microliters of MTB H37Rv genomic DNA (Colorado State University), corresponding to ~104 genomic copies, was used as
the positive control, five microliters of irradiated water as
the negative control, and five microliters of template DNA
from each clinical specimen. Samples whose dissociation
curve peaks had a melting temperature within 1°C of TB
DNA were selected for further analysis on a 3% TBE gel.
Bands that electrophoresed within approximately 10 bp
of TB DNA were excised and purified using the QIAquick
Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia CA). Both
strands of the DNA were directly sequenced by GenePass,
Inc (Nashville, TN). Only sequences verified from the positive and negative strand of the amplicon were used for
analysis. Alignments of sodA sequences from sarcoidosis
patients were performed using the NCBI BLAST program.
Phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignments
Sequences of sodA from various Mycobacterium species
were obtained from GenBank. Because there is no genetic
variability of sodA among members of MTB complex;
sequence alignment was based upon GenBank no.
AF061030. In addition to MTB complex and sarcoidosis
amplicons, multiple corresponding nucleotide sequence
alignments of sodA region 4 (base pairs 215–446, GenBank no. AF061030) from pathogenic and nonpathogenic mycobacteria were created using ClustalX.
Phylograms of nucleotide alignments were generated
using the Paup 4.0b10 neighbor-joining method, based
on HKY85 distances. The resulting phylograms were displayed using midpoint rooting.

Preparation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC)
PBMC were isolated from blood drawn into tubes containing EDTA, and separated by Ficoll-Hypaque density
gradient separation (Amersham Biosciences) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. The PBMC were cryopreserved in fetal calf serum with 10% dimethy sulfoxide
(DMSO), and stored in liquid nitrogen until time for analysis.
Synthesis of mycobacterial peptides
Forty sodA peptides, 15-mers overlapping by 10, which
span the entire amino acid sequence of MTB superoxide
dismutase (GenBank no. AAD15824.1) were generated
(Table 2). Each sodA peptide was synthesized by solidphase F-moc chemistry (Genemed Synthesis, San Diego,
CA), to a purity of >70%.
ELISPOT analysis for interferon gamma production
ELISPOT assays were performed as previously described
[15]. Briefly 96-well polyvinylidene difluoride-backed
plates were coated with anti-interferon-γ [IFN-γ] mAb, 1DIK (0.5 μg/ml; Mabtech, Stockhlm, Sweden) at 4°C
overnight. The following day, PBMC were added directly
at 105 cells/well in R10 media (RPMI-1640 supplemented
with 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml
streptomycin, and 10% heat inactivated FBS (Invitrogen
Corporation, Irvine, CA) and then sodA peptides were
added to individual wells in duplicate (20 μg/ml final
concentration). Phytohemagluttin A (PHA) or media
alone served as positive and negative controls, respectively. The plates were incubated for 18 hours at 37°C in

http://respiratory-research.com/content/9/1/36

5% CO2. After washing six times with phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) plates were incubated for 2 hours with biotinylated anti-IFN-γ mAb, 7-B6-1 (0.5 μg/ml; Mabtech).
After additional washes, a 1:2,000 dilution of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate was added to each
well for 2 hours. The plates were then washed, and IFN-γ
producing cells detected after a 10–20 min color reaction
using chromogenic alkaline phosphatase substrate (BCIP/
NBT Substrate Kit, Vector Laboratories). Interferon
gamma (IFN-γ) producing cells were counted using an
IMMUNOSPOT 3 Analyzer (Cellular Technology Limited
(C.T.L); Cleveland, OH). Results were expressed as the
number of spot-forming cells (SFC) per 106 PBMC. The
mean number of spots in duplicate negative control wells
was less than two for all 26 PPD- participants. A positive
response was defined as at least 50 SFC/106 PBMC, and at
least three times above background. The definition of a
positive result was based upon a prior analysis, involving
recognition of ESAT-6 and katG in systemic sarcoidosis
[9]. Assays using PBMC from PPD-, PPD+ and sarcoidosis
subjects were performed simultaneously; the technicians
were blinded to the clinical diagnosis of each study participant throughout the analysis.
Statistical Analysis
Comparisons of the distribution of T cell frequencies were
performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Categorical
comparisons, such as the percentage of individuals with
immune reactivity to mycobacterial antigens, were made
using Fisher's exact test. All performed comparisons are
reported, all p-values are 2-sided, and all analyses were
performed using R (Version 2.1.1).

Results
Clinical characteristics of study participants
Of the 17 sarcoidosis subjects, 5(29%) were AfricanAmerican, 9(53%) were male, and 16(94%) were ≤ 50
years of age (Table 3). Biopsies were taken from lung,
lymph node, or skin. Of the 16 control subjects, 1(6%)
was African-American, 9(56%) were male, and 11(69%)
were ≤ 50 years of age. Biopsies were taken from lung,
lymph node, skin or colon. Of the three tuberculosis
patients, one was African-American, all were male and
<50 years of age (Table 3). Biopsies were taken from
lymph node in two patients, and the meniscus of the knee
of the third patient. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were highly vis-

ible in two specimens (TB 1 and 3) and rare in one specimen (TB 2); M. tuberculosis was cultured from all three.
Granulomatous involvement was noted in all 17 sarcoidosis specimens, 10 of 16 control specimens, and all
three tuberculosis specimens (Table 3). Ten of the 17 sarcoidosis subjects had undergone tuberculin skin testing at
the discretion of their primary physician; all ten were negative, as were all of the PPD- healthy volunteers. The status
of the remaining seven is unknown.

Sequences consistent with MTB complex sodA were
amplified from sarcoidosis granulomas
Multiple regions of sodA were amplified from all three
tuberculosis patients (Table 3). The number of regions
that we were able to amplify correlated with the number
of bacilli seen on histologic staining (Table 3). For example, we amplified all six regions of MTB complex sodA
from TB 3, a lymph node from an AIDS patient, containing numerous AFB. In contrast, we amplified only three
regions from TB 2, a knee specimen, which possessed only
rare AFB on histologic stain. Each sarcoidosis sample was
AFB negative, and we generally amplified a single region
of sodA, compared to multiple ones. Due to the small
number of TB specimens tested, it is difficult to determine
a true correlation of amplication cycle and detection of
mycobacteria by AFB histologic staining. The true correlation will require testing additional MTB specimens.

SodA amplicons were detected in 12 of 17 sarcoidosis
specimens, compared to two of 16 negative control specimens (p = 0.001) (Table 3). The sarcoidosis amplicons
spanned regions 2–5; regions 1 and 6 were not amplified
from any of the sarcoidosis specimens. Six specimens were
positive for region 4 and four for region 5. In Sarcoid 1,
amplicons from regions 4 and 5 were detected, resulting
in a segment of sodA that was 276 bp long (GenBank
accession no. DQ822576); in Sarcoid 3, regions 2 and 4
were detected. Sequence analysis of the amplicons from
10 specimens revealed 100% positional identity with
MTB complex. The primers of regions 1 and 4 were capable of amplifying sodA nucleic acids from nontuberculosis mycobacteria, such as M. kansasii (personal
observation). However, only sequences consistent with
MTB complex were detected. In two specimens (Sarcoid 2
and 15), the amplicons from region 4 contained 99%
positional identity with MTB complex. The same polymorphism, A302G, was detected in both specimens (GenBank accession no. DQ768096), despite these samples
being processed and analyzed three months apart. This
nucleotide substitution resulted in a D101G mutation
(GenBank accession no. ABG68026) in a previously published amino acid sequence for MTB sodA (GenBank
accession no. AAD15824.1) (Figure 1A). Phylogenetic
analysis of the unique sarcoidosis sodA sequences at position 215–446 based upon GenBank No. AF061030
(Region 4) distinguished them from other members of
MTB complex (Figure 1B).
It has been reported that environmental mycobacteria
preferentially localize to established tuberculous granulomas [16]. In order to determine if the detection of mycobacterial sodA in sarcoidosis granulomas reflected
preferential localization of mycobacteria to granulomatous inflammation, we analyzed granulomatous controls
of known etiology. Despite extracting and analyzing sar-

coidosis and controls specimens simultaneously, sodA
nucleic acids were absent in all but 2 control patients,
Controls 2 and 16. MTB complex sodA amplicons were
detected in these two specimens, although they were negative for mycobacteria by both histology and culture. In
Control 2, sodA amplicons were detected for regions 4
and 5, while only region 4 was amplified from Control 16.
There was a significant difference for the detection of sodA
nucleic acids among the granulomatous sarcoidosis specimens (12 of 17), in comparison to the granulomatous
negative controls (2 of 10) (p = 0.018) (Table 3).
Frozen and paraffin-embedded specimens sarcoidosis and
control specimens were included to determine whether
mycobacteria were introduced during tissue fixation.
There was not a significant difference in the presence of
sodA nucleic acids among the sarcoidosis specimens that
were frozen in comparison to those that were formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded (5/6 versus 7/11, p = 0.6) (Table
3).
Immune recognition of sodA is distinct between sarcoidosis
and PPD- healthy volunteers
Several reports have demonstrated the presence of cellular
immune responses to mycobacterial antigens among
patients infected with MTB [12,17]. Because analysis of
the sarcoidosis amplicons were most consistent with MTB
complex sodA, we generated 40 peptides that cumulatively span the entire MTB sodA protein (GenBank no.
AAD15824.1), and stimulated PBMC from a subgroup of
sarcoidosis, PPD- and PPD+ subjects to identify immunogenic peptides. There was no recognition of any of the 40
sodA peptides among the PPD- control subjects. Among
the sarcoidosis and PPD+ subjects, four of the 40 peptides
were recognized most frequently: sodA 31, 33, 36 and 38
(Table 2). PBMC from all 49 subjects were tested against
these four peptides; peptides before or after peptides 31,
33, 36 and 38 were also tested if PBMC were available.

Of the 17 sarcoidosis subjects from whom we obtained
archival tissues for molecular analysis, we were able to
obtain PBMC from 12. The clinical characteristics of the
sarcoidosis subjects were detailed earlier. Because the
biopsy and PBMC were not obtained simultaneously,
there was variation in the age of the sarcoidosis subjects
(Table 3 and 4 reflects the subject's age at acquisition of
tissue or PBMC, respectively). In addition to these 12 subjects, we obtained PBMC from 26 PPD- healthy volunteers, and 11 subjects with PPD+. Of the 26 PPD- patients,
14(54%) were African American, 6(23%) were male and
20(77%) ≤ 50 years of age (Table 4). Of the 11 PPD+ subjects, 4(36%) were African American, 3(27%) male, and
8(73%) ≤ 50 years of age (Table 4).

Comparison of sodA amplicons generated from sarcoidosis granulomas to M. tuberculosis sodA. PCR analysis for
sodA nucleic acids in sarcoidosis granulomas revealed amplicons with 100% positional identity with M. tuberculosis complex
(MTB) among 10 of 12 sarcoidosis specimens, represented by Sarcoidosis 3. Region 4 of Sarcoid 2 contained the same nucleotide substitution as Sarcoid 15 (A302G), resulting in the amino acid substitution D101G (Figure 1A). The two sarcoidosis
samples were processed three months apart. Phylogenetic analysis of the amplicons placed all the sequences as most consistent
with members of MTB complex, but noted that the sequences detected in Sarcoid 2 and 15 were distinct from other members,
including the 10 sarcoidosis samples (Figure 1B).

Using the ELISPOT assay, we detected immune recognition of sodA peptides among six of 12 sarcoidosis subjects, compared to one of the 26 PPD- controls (p =
0.002), and six of 11 subjects with PPD+ infection (p =
1.0) (Table 4). We performed multivariable logistic regression analysis to assess if factors such as sex, race, or site of
involvement affected recognition of sodA. There was no
significant association with either of these factors,
although there was a trend toward significance in regards
to race. For example, 4/4 African-Americans (AA) with sarcoidosis recognized sodA using ELISPOT, compared to 2/
8 Caucasians (p = 0.06); 4/5 PPD+ AA recognized sodA
compared to 2/6 Caucasians (p = 0.24); and 1/14 PPDcontrol AA recognized sodA compared to 0/12 Caucasians
(p = 1.0). Although none of these comparisons are statistically significant, this could be due to low power. In fact,
we performed multivariable logistic regression, adjusting
for race (AA or non-AA) and group (PPD- control, sarcoidosis, or PPD+), and AA race was significantly associated with increased recognition (p = 0.01). However, after
adjusting for race, sarcoidosis and PPD+ participants were
still more likely to recognize sodA than PPD- controls (p
= 0.002 and 0.01, respectively), consistent with the unadjusted analyses.

Despite negative culture and histology for mycobacterial
infection in sarcoidosis specimens, there was a significant
difference in recognition of sodA peptides between the
sarcoidosis and PPD- healthy volunteers, but not between
sarcoidosis and PPD+ subjects. We also assessed the distribution of the T cell frequencies among the PPD-, sarcoidosis and PPD+ subjects. There was a significant difference
between the sarcoidosis and PPD- subjects (p = 0.002,
Wilcoxon), but again, not between the sarcoidosis and
PPD+ subjects (p = 0.72) (Figure 2). Three sarcoidosis
subjects recognized two or more sodA peptides, demonstrating that multiple sodA epitopes generate a Th-1
immune response (Figure 3).
The majority of sarcoidosis subjects have molecular or
immunologic evidence of Mycobacterium sodA
Prior PCR analysis and immune recognition assays for the
presence of sodA was significantly distinct between the
sarcoidosis and PPD- control subjects. We were interested
in the number of sarcoidosis subjects possessing molecular or immunologic evidence for sodA. There were 12 sarcoidosis subjects of whom we obtained archival tissue and
blood. Eight of the 12 were positive by PCR analysis, and
six positive by the ELISPOT assay. Four subjects (Sarcoid

most consistent with members of MTB complex, thus
revealing mycobacteria capable of inducing granuloma
formation. The majority of the sequences possessed 100%
positional identity with MTB (GenBank No. AF061030);
however, sequence analysis of the amplicons also revealed
sequences that were genetically distinct (Table 3, Figure
1B). To confirm a polymorphism, we insured that the
nucleotide substitution was present on both strands and
that an actual peak was visualized on the chromatogram.
The detection of the polymorphism, A302G, in two sarcoidosis specimens processed and analyzed at separate
time points also suggests that this polymorphism is not
due to PCR error.

There was a lack of recognition of sodA peptides among the

6–8, 13) were positive for sodA nucleic acids, as well as
recognition of sodA peptides; Sarcoid 11 and 12 were negative by both assays (Table 5). In total among the 12 specimens, 10 were positive by PCR or by ELISPOT analysis
and 50% of the specimens had molecular and immunologic agreement for the presence or absence of sodA
(Table 5).

Discussion
The absence of histologic and microbiologic evidence of
microorganisms in the sarcoidosis granulomas has led to
questions about a role for infectious agents in sarcoidosis
immunopathogenesis. This report describes molecular
and immunologic support for the presence of the virulence factor, Mycobacterium sodA, in systemic sarcoidosis.
The strength of molecular analysis for sodA lies in the
ability to identify pathogenic Mycobacterium species [13].
The detection of sodA nucleic acids yielded important
information in this study. Although the primers in region
1 and region 4 were capable of detecting nontuberculous
mycobacteria, sequence analysis of the amplicons was

Phylogenetic analysis of the amplicons derived from the
sarcoidosis granulomas revealed three major points: 1)
There is a clear association between the sarcoidosis amplicons and the sequences of members of MTB complex,
demonstrating that they share a recent common ancestor,
and precluding the possibility that the sarcoidosis
sequences are derived from distantly related mycobacterial or Nocardia species. 2) The sequences from Sarcoidosis 2 and 15 form a distinct clade, emphasizing that these
sequences may belong to a single mycobacterial species
(Figure 1B). Whether these mutations reflect a distinct
member of MTB complex or M. tuberculosis strain with a
mutation in sodA is unclear. A sodA mutation, unique
from that found in the two sarcoidosis specimens, has
been described in an isoniazid-resistant MTB strain [18].
3) The substantial evolutionary distances between the sarcoidosis amplicons and the atypical mycobacteria eliminate the possibility that we have sequences of
environmental mycobacteria as a contaminant.
Superinfecting mycobacteria preferentially home to tuberculous granulomas [16]. This observation has been used
to explain the detection of mycobacterial nucleic acids in
sarcoidosis granulomas. We included in this analysis 10
granulomatous control specimens of known etiology.
SodA DNA was detected in only two of them. One of the
specimens was a lymph node containing Histoplasma capsulatum in an individual with rheumatoid arthritis. Prior
reports have noted an association with latent tuberculosis
in such patients [19]. The detection of mycobacterial sodA
in sarcoidosis specimens in a significantly different proportion compared to granulomatous negative control
specimens suggests that the presence of sodA sequences
does not simply reflect preferential localization of environmental mycobacteria to established granulomas.
The inclusion of sarcoidosis and control specimens that
were frozen or paraffin-embedded was designed to
address the possibility that mycobacteria are introduced
into sarcoidosis specimens during tissue fixation. There
are reports of environmental mycobacteria in hospital

Recognition of multiple sodA peptides among individual sarcoidosis subjects
Recognition of multiple sodA peptides among individual sarcoidosis subjects. Peptide screening identified peptides
toward the terminal end of sodA as being immunogenic. Among the sarcoidosis subjects who recognized sodA, recognition of
more than one peptide was frequently observed. Peptides 36 and 38 were frequently immunogenic, although there was variation in the magnitude of the response generated by each subject. Numerous sodA peptides were recognized by PPD+ subjects.
A representative analysis of the PPD+ subjects is included. The recognition of multiple sodA peptides by the sarcoidosis subjects suggests that the sarcoidosis Th-1 immune response may be elicited by multiple antigenic peptides rather than a single
dominant antigen.

water systems, and well as fiberoptic bronchoscopes
[20,21]. We chose snap frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue specimens among the sarcoidosis and PPD- controls
specimens. The absence of sodA in the majority of the
negative control specimens, as well as the presence of
sodA nucleic acids in snap frozen and paraffin-embedded
sarcoidosis tissues, suggests that the mycobacterial nucleic
acids detected are not present due to contamination during tissue fixation. Identification of immunogenic sodA
peptides has not been previously reported in tuberculosis

or sarcoidosis subjects. Despite the absence of mycobacteria by histologic staining and culture of sarcoidosis specimens, the immune response to sodA among the
sarcoidosis subjects more closely reflected the response
among PPD+ subjects than PPD- volunteers. There was
not a significant difference between the sarcoidosis and
tuberculosis subjects in the percentage of subjects recognizing these peptides or the distribution of the T cell frequencies (Figure 2). Many of the sarcoidosis and PPD+
subjects recognized more than one peptide, suggesting

that the immune response observed in these subjects can
be elicited by multiple sodA epitopes (Figure 3). Due to
limitations in the number of PBMC, we were unable to
test all 40 sodA peptides, so it is possible that sodA
epitopes other than the four that we tested exist.

active sarcoidosis involvement [ie the granuloma],
whereas the immunologic analysis involves systemic
responses. Sensitivity for immune recognition might
improve by using lymphocytes from sites of active inflammation such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or directly
from lymphocytes derived from fresh sarcoidosis granulomas. Finally, the sensitivity of the ELISPOT may have
improved if we had tested all 40 sodA peptides. It is
unlikely that the four peptides are recognized by all HLA
types [25].

Conclusion
The most interesting finding in this study was the demonstration that molecular analysis of sarcoidosis granulomas
for microbial virulence factors can lead to identification of
target antigens. The responses detected closely parallel
prior reports of immune recognition of secreted proteins
in mycobacterial infections [17,26]. A dual analysis for
microbial nucleic acids and immune responses increases
the sensitivity for detecting microbial virulence factors in
idiopathic diseases, providing complementary mechanisms.

The dual assessment for mycobacteria in sarcoidosis
pathogenesis provides interesting information. Among
the 12 subjects, 10 possessed molecular or immunologic
evidence for sodA. This illustrates the importance of using
complementary approaches to assess for microorganisms
in pathologic specimens of unknown etiology. The two
sarcoidosis subjects who were negative by both methods
suggest that mycobacteria do not have a role in all sarcoidosis specimens, supporting other reports of the inappropriate diagnosis of sarcoidosis in subjects with disease
with close phenotypic and pathologic features, such as
chronic beryllium disease [22]. Thus sarcoidosis may be a
common pathologic phenotype that can be caused by
infectious or non-infectious etiologies.

Competing interests

PCR of archival specimens was more sensitive for sodA
than ELISPOT analysis of peripheral blood (Table 5).
There was a time lapse between acquisition of the blood
and tissue samples in a given patient; this differential timing of biopsies and blood testing is a major limitation of
the analysis. The common observance in the dual analysis
was a positive PCR analysis for sodA but a lack of recognition by ELISPOT analysis. This result is likely due to the
preservation of nucleic acids by tissue fixation, as opposing to an evolving host immune response. Some of the
patients had resolved their disease between the diagnostic
biopsy and acquisition of PBMC. Concordantly, there
exists evidence that immune recognition of mycobacterial
antigens cease with clearance of mycobacteria [17,23,24].
Future studies using blood and tissue of sarcoidosis subjects obtained simultaneously will be performed. Another
limitation is that the PCR involves analysis of a site of
