Molecular characterization and phylogenetic
study of peste des petits ruminants viruses from
North central States of Nigeria

Abstract
Background: Peste des petits ruminants is an endemic disease of sheep and goats in Nigeria and vaccination has
been the method of control but sporadic outbreaks have been reported. This study was carried out to characterize
PPR viruses from outbreaks in 2007 and 2009 from Kaduna and Plateau States.
Results: Of the 33 clinical samples analysed, 51.52% (n = 17) were positive for F protein gene primers (F1/F2). All
the samples had a sequence similarity of 98-100% among them and 92-97% with the reference vaccine (Nig 75/1)
strain. The deduced amino acid homology ranges between 96.3-99.7%. Phylogenetically all the Nigerian sequences
cluster with Nig 75/1 and Nig 76/1 in lineage 1.
Conclusions: PPR is still a problem in Kaduna and Plateau States of Nigeria. The strains involved were genetically
closely related to the vaccine strain (Nig 75/1) used in the country. Based on this study, the continued outbreaks in
the Country is not due to the efficacy of the vaccine. Therefore, to achieve effective control and possibly
eradication of PPR in Nigeria, the current control strategies should be revisited.

Background
Peste des petits ruminants disease (PPR), caused by PPR
virus (PPRV), is a highly contagious disease of sheep
and goats that has been widely reported in Sub Saharan
Africa [1]. The disease has been characterized by fever,
erosive-ulcerative stomatitis, fibrino-necrotic tracheitis,
brochointestitial pneumonia and diarrhea [2,3]. Morbidity and mortality can be as high as 100% and 90%,
respectively, depending on the endemic status of the disease in an area [2].
This disease was first described in West Africa in
1940s [4] and the first outbreak was describe in Nigeria
in 1975 by Taylor and Abegunde [5]. The virus has
since spread to other countries. PPR has been reported
in Southern Asia, Near East, Arabian Peninsula and in
recent years outbreaks have been reported in Turkey
(2000), Tibet China (2007), Morocco (2008), Tanzania
(2008) and Uganda (2007). Since the earlier reports on
Nigeria in 1975, the disease has become endemic giving

rise to economic loses to the rural poor who rely on
these animals as a source of livelihood.
Earlier studies have suggested that PPR might have
been around for quite some time in different countries
but was wrongly diagnosed [6]. It has also been confused with rinderpest because of the clinical similarity
[7]. Laboratory techniques that were used in diagnosis
were virus neutralization test (VNT), agar gel immunodiffusion test (AGID), counter immuno-electrophoresis
(CIEP) and virus isolation which has been time consuming and laborious [8]. Recently, molecular biology tools
have made it possible to diagnose this disease rapidly
and with great sensitivity compared to earlier test [9,10].
Etiological agent of PPR is a member of the family
Paramyxoviridae and genus morbillivirus [11]. The viral
genome is 15,948 nucleotides long [12] and contains six
genes encoding six major polypeptides: nucleocapsid
protein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M),
fusion (F) protein, hemagglutinin (H), and large RNAdependent polymerase protein. It is a linear, single
stranded, non segmented, negative sense RNA virus
[11,12]. Although PPRV has been known to occur as
one strain or serotype [13], partial sequence analysis of

the fusion protein gene, indicates occurrence of four
lineages (1, 2, 3 and 4), of which three have been reported
in Africa [13]. The fourth (4th) lineage is the only one
that exists in the Indian sub continent but East African
lineage 3 has been reported to coexist with the lineage 4.
This phylogenetic analysis is helping in the epidemiological understanding of the spread of the disease among animal populations. In Nigeria there is continuing pockets of
outbreaks of PPR in small ruminants necessitating studies to delineate the molecular details of the circulating
field virus (es). The aim of the present study was to
determine the phylogenetic relatedness of PPR viruses
from outbreaks in the North central States of Nigeria.

homology. The two sequences from Kaduna (HQ317873
and HQ317874) showed 99% nucleotide homology while
the seven sequences from Plateau showed 98-100% similarities. Two sequences (2) from Plateau (HQ317876 and
HQ317879) were entirely identical in their nucleotide.
Inter- State, one (1) sequence sample from Kaduna
(HQ317873) and one (1) from Plateau (HQ317877) were
also entirely identical among them. All the nine (9) field
sequences also showed 93-95% nucleotide similarity
with the vaccine. Identity levels of deduced Amino acid
sequences of the 9 samples ranged from 96.3-99.7%
(Figure 2. Alignment of deduced amino acid of Nigeria
PPR and other sequences).

Results

Phylogenetic analysis

Detection of PPRV F gene

The results of phylogenetic analysis of the sequences (n
= 9) obtained from this study based on the 322 bp lineage specific sequences of F gene are shown in Figure 3.
They were aligned with other available sequences from
the GenBank, including sequences from Turkey, India,
Pakistan and China. All the Nigerian sequences clustered into lineage 1 together with the vaccine strain Nig
75/1 and Nig 76/1 separate from the Turkey and Indian
strain which belong to the lineage 4. None of the
sequences clustered with Cote d’Ivoire which belongs to
lineage 2. There were no sequences of lineage 3 in the
GenBank to be used in generating the tree. From Plateau State, HQ317876 (Nig/Vnt/S09) and HQ317879
(Nig/VSM/S09) showed close relationship (Figure 3Phylogenetic tree of Nigeria sequences and other sequences
from the GenBank). These findings suggested that the
Nigerian PPR viruses vary in the level of similarity but
are homologous and similar to the vaccine strain isolated in 1975 (Nig 75/1) used in the country.

Of the 33 clinical samples collected from sheep (n = 20)
and goats (n = 13), 17 were positive for PPRV by F1/F2
primer amplification (Positivity rate = 51.52%). The
remaining 16 samples were negative for PPRV. All the 7
samples collected from Kaduna were positive while out
of the 26 samples from Plateau only 10 gave the target
372 bp amplicon (Figure 1. PCR amplicon for F gene
showing band size of 372 bp). The reference vaccine
strain (Nig 75/1) also yielded the 372 bp amplicon.
Sequencing

The 372 bp region of the F gene of 17 PPRV positive
samples were obtained. Of the ten (10) positive PCR
products, nine (9) sequences were generated (7 from
Plateau and 2 from Kaduna). One sample (VRD/348/09,
from Plateau) did not yield any sequence. The remaining 7 positive samples were not sequenced. All the 9
sequences were submitted to the GenBank (Accession
number: HQ317871 - HQ317879)
Sequence similarity analysis

A sequence comparison of the nine (9) 322 bp F gene
sequence fragments showed 98-100% nucleotide

disease has continued with outbreaks occurring sporadically [14]. Due to the endemic situation in Nigeria, control has been mainly hinged on vaccination [15].
Outbreaks are detected clinically and confirmed either
serologically or using molecular techniques. The F gene
based RT-PCR developed by Forsyth and Barrett [9] has
gained much popularity, though PCR tools based on
other gene targets have become available [10]. The PPR
specific primers F1 and F2 developed by aforementioned
workers give an amplification of 372 bp between positions 777 to 1148 nucleotides of PPRV F gene. In the
present study, PPRV was detected by F gene based RTPCR in 17 (51.52%) of the 33 clinical samples tested,
which confirmed PPRV in the two North central states.
Previous survey by Obi and Ojeh [16] in Nigeria
reported a positivity rate of 86.8% and 81.6% from tissue
homogenate using dot ELISA and standard Indirect
ELISA, respectively, from the Southern States of Nigeria.
Our findings suggest that PPR is less prevalent in the
Northern States (Kaduna and Plateau) as opposed to the
Southern. Arguably, the differences in positivity rate
may also be related to the detection method, sample
size and the presence of other exacerbating diseases
such as pasteurellosis, caprine contagions pleuropneumonia (CCPP), blue tongue (BTV), contagious ecthyma
and foot and mouth disease (FMD) [17] which can
occur concurrently. Nonetheless the PPR positivity rate
we found was similar to that reported recently in an
endemic region in India (50%) using RT-PCR [18].
Although PPR has been a problem in Nigeria for a
long time, studies did not go as far as sequencing of the
isolates apart from the full genomes sequence of Nig
75/1 (vaccine strain) and Nig 76/1 (field isolate) which
were done in Pirbright [12,19]. Our study is the first to
carry out sequencing and sequence analysis of F gene
from PPR viruses involved in the recent disease

outbreaks (2007 and 2009). A sequence comparison
showed high level of homology (98-100%) of the circulating viruses suggesting that these viruses do not
undergo rapid genetic changes in the F gene. Our data
appear to be in agreement with other studies [18,20]
who reported that the PPR virus is more prone to mutations on the N gene compared to the F gene. Between
States, the PPR viruses were also highly homologous.
This suggests criss-cross movement of infected small
ruminants between States. Geographically, the two states
share boundaries but also human related activities such
as persons buying and transporting animals which may
account for long distance spread of PPR. According to
Ezeibe et al., [21] vaccinated animals can shed the virus
from faeces for up to 12 weeks post vaccination. Arguably, naturally infected animals if moved from place to
place or State to State can form a big source of infection
to naive populations.
Approximately 35 years ago, PPR was reported in
Nigeria from sheep and goats purchased from open markets at Vom and Potiskum [5]. Since then the tissue culture rinderpest vaccine (TCRV) was used to confer
protection against PPR until recently when the homologous PPR vaccine was developed by Diallo [22] from the
attenuation of Nig 75/1 PPRV strain. Interestingly, all the
Nigerian strains from this study demonstrated 93-95%
homology to the latter vaccine strain currently used for
the control of the PPR in Nigeria. Our study revealed
that the Nig 75/1 vaccine is indeed the suitable one for
use in Nigeria. Based on our findings, the continued
occurrence of outbreaks in Nigeria may not be attributed
to the choice of vaccine but rather on other factors such
as inadequacies related to the control strategy. Indeed
Annatte et al., [23] have reported lapses in Veterinary
extension services in relation to PPR control in Lagos
State, the situation may not be different in other States.

Figure 3 Phylogenetic relationships between peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) detected from Nigeria samples in 2007/2009
with other sequences from the GenBank. PPRV strains sequenced in this study are highlighted. Phylogenetic analyses were completed with
MEGA 4 software that used a neighbour-joining algorithm.

A consensus Phylogenetic tree based on the lineage
specific 322 bp of F gene sequence was constructed with
the help of MEGA 4 program. In accordance with the
previous studies [13-15,24], all the Nigerian strains
including the vaccine strain Nig 75/1 and Nig 76/1 isolate clustered together. All the Asian and Turkish isolates, clustered together into a separate branch from the
Nigerian isolates, and the branching was supported by
bootstrap values of 500 (100%). None of the sequences
clustered with the strain from Cote d’Ivoire which
belongs to lineage 2. Since the sequence data for the
African isolates belonging to lineage 3 were not available

in the Genbank, they were not included in the Phylogenetic analysis. Thus, from the Phylogenetic tree (Figure
3), it was evident that all the isolates of Kaduna and Plateau clustered together with Nig 75/1 and Nig 76/1 isolates in lineage 1, reinforcing the findings that these
isolates are homologous. Epidemiologically these data
suggest that there has been no introduction of any new
PPRV strain into Nigerian small ruminant populations.

Conclusion
The data from this study have shown that PPR is a problem in Kaduna and Plateau States of Nigeria. The

Luka et al. BMC Veterinary Research 2011, 7:32

strains involved were genetically closely related to the
vaccine strain (Nig 75/1) used in the country. Based on
these data, the continued outbreaks in the Country is
not due to the efficacy of the vaccine. Therefore, to
achieve effective control and possibly eradication of PPR
in Nigeria, the current control strategies should be
revisited.

Methods
Clinical samples and the reference vaccine strain

A total of 33 (7 from Kaduna and 26 from Plateau State)
clinically suspected PPR tissue samples (lymph node,
spleen, liver, lungs and intestine) of sheep (n = 20) and
goats (n = 13) from outbreaks were collected from
Kaduna and Plateau States by field Veterinary Officers
in 2007 and 2009, respectively. The samples were kept
at -70°C at the Central Diagnostic Laboratory of the
National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI), Vom,
Plateau State. PPR vaccine strain (Nig 75/1) from Pestvac®, Jordan was used as a reference strain virus in this
study.
Shipping of samples

Permission to use the samples (Additional File 1:
Appendix 1) were obtained from the Executive Director
NVRI and shipped into Uganda with an import permit
(Additional File 2: Appendix 2) from the Commissioner
Animal Health and Entomology, Ministry of Agriculture
Animal Industry and Fisheries, Entebbe. Standard procedure was followed as required by the Office of International Epizootics (OIE) and International Air Transport
Authority (IATA) to ship in the samples. The samples
were kept at -70°C at the National Animal Disease Diagnostics and Epidemiology Centre (NADDEC), Entebbe,
where the laboratory analysis was done.

hexamer, 0.125 mM each dNTPs, 10 units of ribonuclease inhibitor (MBI Fermentas), two units of Omniscript reverse transcriptase and the buffer provided by
the manufacturer in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction was carried out at 37°C for 60 min and stopped by
incubation at 95°C for 10 min.
Three microliters of the reverse transcribed (cDNA)
product was used as template for the PCR. The reaction
was carried out in 200 μl thin walled PCR tubes, in a
final volume of 25 μl containing the following reagents:
12.5 μl of DreamTaq PCR Master Mix (2×) containing
ready to use Dream Taq DNA polymerase, buffer,
MgCl 2 and dNTPs (MBI Fermentas), 1 μl of forward
and reverse primers (10 pmoles of each primer). The
fusion gene specific primers used were (F1(F) 5’ATC
ACA GTG TTA AAG CCT GTA GAG G 3’ F gene
777-801 and F2(R) 5’GAG ACT GAG TTT GTG ACC
TAC AAG C 3’ F gene 1124-1148) [9,10]. PCR amplification was carried out as follows: Initial denaturation
step 95°C for 5 min followed by denaturation at 94°C
for 30 min, annealing at 50°C at 60 sec, extension at 72°
C for 2 min for 35 cycles, and final extension at 72°C
for 25 min. The length of the products was 372 bp [26].
Analysis of PCR amplified products

The PCR amplicons were resolved on 2.0% agarose in
Tris-borate- EDTA (TBE) buffer gels stained with ethidium bromide. Ten μl of the PCR product from each of
the tubes were mixed with 1 μl of 6× buffer and electrophoresed along with 50 bp DNA molecular weight marker (GeneRular, MBI Fermentas) at a constant 80 V for
45 min in 1× TAE buffer. Amplified product was viewed
under UV light and documented by a UVtransilluminator.
Cloning and sequence analysis

Sample processing and RNA extraction

One gram of tissue from each sample was weighed and
homogenized using a homogenizer or a pestle and mortar with sterile glass. After homogenizing 9 ml of PBS
was added and centrifuged in a refrigerated centrifuge at
10,000 rpm for 5 min to make 10% tissue suspension.
The supernatant was decanted into a sterile tube and
kept at 4°C for RNA extraction [25] and the pellet discarded into a disinfectant. The viral RNA extraction was
carried out using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit following
the manufacturer’s guidelines. Extracted RNA was kept
briefly at 4°C pending RT-PCR.
Reverse Transcription and Polymerase chain reaction

Five microlitres extracted RNA was reverse transcribed
to cDNA using Omniscript™ Reverse transcriptase kit
(Qiagen, Germany). The reaction was carried out in 200
μl tubes with the following conditions: 1 μl of random

PCR amplicons of the F gene were purified using QIAquick PCR Purification kit and sent over to Inqaba Biotec (South Africa) for sequencing. The sequencing
involved cloning of ten representative RT-PCR products
into a recombinant plasmid to obtain templates for
sequencing. The recombinant plasmid carrying the
insert from the representative clone was then subjected
to automated DNA sequencing on ABI PRISM 310
Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA) and BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle sequencing kit (Applied Bio
systems, USA). The sequence data were analysed with
Finch TV and sequence similarity searches were conducted using the basic length alignment search tool
(BLAST) of the National Centre for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI). Complete alignment of nucleotide
sequences was performed using ClustalW and deduced
amino acids determined by MegAlign software version 5
(DNAStar, Inc., Madison, WI, USA). The phylogeny was

inferred using neighbour-joining method in MEGA version 4.1 [27] by aligning 322 bp lineage specific nucleotide segment of the F gene with other sequences
available in the GenBank. The robustness of groupings
was assessed by bootstrap resampling of 1000 replicates
and the tree visualized with same program
