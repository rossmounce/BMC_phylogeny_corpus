Abstract
Background: Chlamydia have reduced genomes that reflect their obligately parasitic lifestyle. Despite their
different tissue tropisms, chlamydial strains share a large number of common genes and have few recognized
pseudogenes, indicating genomic stability. All of the Chlamydiaceae have homologs of the aaxABC gene cluster that
encodes a functional arginine:agmatine exchange system in Chlamydia (Chlamydophila)pneumoniae. However,
Chlamydia trachomatis serovar L2 strains have a nonsense mutation in their aaxB genes, and C. trachomatis serovar
A and B strains have frameshift mutations in their aaxC homologs, suggesting that relaxed selection may have
enabled the evolution of aax pseudogenes. Biochemical experiments were performed to determine whether the
aaxABC genes from C. trachomatis strains were transcribed, and mutagenesis was used to identify nucleotide
substitutions that prevent protein maturation and activity. Molecular evolution techniques were applied to
determine the relaxation of selection and the scope of aax gene inactivation in the Chlamydiales.
Results: The aaxABC genes were co-transcribed in C. trachomatis L2/434, during the mid-late stage of cellular
infection. However, a stop codon in the aaxB gene from this strain prevented the heterologous production of an
active pyruvoyl-dependent arginine decarboxylase. Replacing that ochre codon with its ancestral tryptophan
codon rescued the activity of this self-cleaving enzyme. The aaxB gene from C. trachomatis D/UW-3 was
heterologously expressed as a proenzyme that failed to cleave and form the catalytic pyruvoyl cofactor. This
inactive protein could be rescued by replacing the arginine-115 codon with an ancestral glycine codon. The aaxC
gene from the D/UW-3 strain encoded an active arginine:agmatine antiporter protein, while the L2/434 homolog
was unexpectedly inactive. Yet the frequencies of nonsynonymous versus synonymous nucleotide substitutions
show no signs of relaxed selection, consistent with the recent inactivation of these genes.
Conclusion: The ancestor of the Chlamydiaceae had a functional arginine:agmatine exchange system that is
decaying through independent, parallel processes in the C. trachomatis lineage. Differences in arginine metabolism
among Chlamydiaceae species may be partly associated with their tissue tropism, possibly due to the protection
conferred by a functional arginine-agmatine exchange system against host nitric oxide production and innate
immunity. The independent loss of AaxB activity in all sequenced C. trachomatis strains indicates continual gene
inactivation and illustrates the difficulty of recognizing recent bacterial pseudogenes from sequence comparison,
transcriptional profiling or the analysis of nucleotide substitution rates.

Background
Members of the Chlamydiaceae family grow inside host
cells, when infectious elementary bodies (EBs) differentiate into replicative reticulate bodies (RBs). Worldwide,
Chlamydia trachomatis serovars A-C are responsible for
millions of cases of conjunctivitis and trachoma [1]. Genital infections by C. trachomatis serovars D-K cause the
most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted
disease [2]. C. trachomatis lymphogranuloma venereum
serovars L1-L3 are invasive strains that can disseminate to
lymph nodes and cause chronic inflammation. Chlamydia
(Chlamydophila)pneumoniae causes 10% of pneumonia
cases each year, and most adults are seropositive for C.
pneumoniae antigens [3]. Despite differences in tissue tropism and virulence, these chlamydiae share a significant
portion of their genomes, including about 711 coding
DNA sequences (CDS) [4,5].
The Chlamydiaceae diverged from a non-pathogenic ancestor about 700 mya [5]. Intracellular bacterial pathogens
such as Rickettsia and Chlamydia have undergone reductive
evolution, as reduced purifying selection and a cascading
loss of DNA repair genes led to gene inactivation and
genome contraction [6]. While rickettsial genomes have a
high number of split genes, a high proportion of noncoding DNA, and a low G+C nucleotide composition (~30%)
[7], chlamydial genomes have few recognized pseudogenes, high coding densities (~90%) and moderate G+C
nucleotide compositions (~40%) [8]. Despite the dramatic effects of gene loss, it has been difficult to determine
the mode of reductive evolution from the snapshots provided by modern genome sequences. The chlamydial
genomes are only half as large as the Parachlamydia sp.
UWE25 genome, so both gene acquisition and gene loss
have distinguished these lineages [5].
A comparison between genome sequences from C. trachomatis serovars A and D identified only 18 significant deletions in either strain, producing eight pseudogenes
(interrupted open reading frames) in serovar A [9].
Another comparison between genome sequences from L2
and serovar A/D strains of C. trachomatis identified 15
pseudogenes in L2 strains [10]. Due to the relatively low
number of chlamydial pseudogenes (< 2% of CDS) and
the conservation of chlamydial genome size (1.0 to 1.2
Mbp), these bacteria are believed to have undergone
reductive evolution, arriving at a stable genome structure.
However, this model discounts gene transfer to the
Chlamydiales, positive selection for antigenic proteins, and
thousands of nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions
that have occurred among the strains [9,11-13]. Single
nucleotide polymorphisms account for much of the diversity among C. trachomatis serovars [12]. Deciphering the
differences in their genetic content will provide important
clues to understand tissue tropism and subsequent disease.

Most inactivated, or nonfunctionalized pseudogenes are
recognized in genome sequences by the presence of nonsense mutations or indels that substantially truncate CDS
compared with homologous sequences. However, these
mutations occur less frequently than missense mutations,
which can have either minimal or catastrophic effects on
protein folding and function [14]. Inactivating substitutions are particularly difficult to identify, since these genes
can still be transcribed (and even translated): it is challenging to predict and prove their lack of activity [15].
Even some genes with gross mutations can still be transcribed, leading to a broader definition of pseudogenes
that may include many unrecognized elements [16]. In
this article, we describe the independent inactivation of
two arginine decarboxylase orthologs from Chlamydia trachomatis strains, showing that gene loss continues in these
pathogens, and illustrating the challenges of identifying
recently nonfunctionalized genes.
We previously identified three genes from C. pneumoniae
that comprise an arginine:agmatine exchange system
(AAX). The aaxA gene encodes an outer-membrane porin
protein that stimulates the activity of this system [17]. The
aaxB gene encodes an arginine decarboxylase proenzyme
that self-cleaves at Ser53 to produce a small β-subunit and
a larger α-subunit with a pyruvoyl cofactor that is essential
for catalytic activity [18]. Finally, the aaxC gene encodes a
cytoplasmic-membrane arginine:agmatine antiporter
[17]. Together, these proteins catalyze the import of Larginine, the decarboxylation of arginine to produce
agmatine, and the export of agmatine from the cell. All
chlamydial genome sequences contain orthologs of the
aaxABC genes, which were apparently acquired by the
chlamydial ancestor through horizontal gene transfer.
Both the C. pneumoniae and C. trachomatis strains require
exogenous arginine for growth, and their genomes lack
arginine biosynthesis genes [19,20]. Chlamydial genomes
contain artJ and glnPQ genes encoding a putative ABCtype arginine transporter, which is controlled by the ArgR
transcriptional regulator in some species [21]. Therefore
the AAX system is probably not used to acquire proteinogenic amino acids. Instead, this system could have several
possible functions: it could raise the intracellular pH to
resist acidification, produce agmatine – inhibiting host
cell polyamine biosynthesis, or inhibit nitric oxide synthesis by host cells [17].
Global microarray analysis indicated that C. pneumoniae
aax genes are transcribed late in the developmental cycle
[22]. Similarly, C. trachomatis serovar L2/434 cells transcribe the aaxA and aaxB genes beginning 18 hours post
infection, shortly before RBs begin to differentiate into
EBs [23]. The AaxA protein is incorporated in the outer
membrane in EBs from L2/434 cells [24]. Transcriptional
profiles from C. trachomatis D/UW-3 cells also identified
the highest levels of aaxB and aaxC transcripts at 16–40

hours post infection [25]. In this report, we confirm the
late expression of the aaxA, aaxB and aaxC genes in L2/434
cells and demonstrate that the three genes are co-transcribed, using RT-PCR. However, the C. trachomatis L2/
434 aaxB gene contains an ochre terminator in place of
the tryptophan codon 128 found in other chlamydial
orthologs (Figure 1) [10]. The resulting L2/434 protein is
predicted to be truncated at amino acid 127, compared to
the full 195 amino acids found in the homologous proteins. In contrast, the D/UW-3 aaxB gene is predicted to
express a full-length protein that differs in only three positions from the L2/434 homolog.
To determine whether the C. trachomatis L2/434 and D/
UW-3 strains encode functional AaxB arginine decarboxylases, we cloned both aaxB genes in E. coli and determined
heterologous expression using immunoblotting and activity assays. Neither gene produced a functional arginine

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/166

decarboxylase in E. coli; however, site-directed mutagenesis experiments showed that AaxB from L2/434 could be
rescued by an X128W replacement, and AaxB from D/UW3 could be rescued by an R115G replacement. Multiple
frameshift mutations in aaxC genes from C. trachomatis A/
Har-13 and B/Jali are predicted to inactivate those genes
[10]. E. coli cells expressing AaxC demonstrated arginine
uptake activity of the D/UW-3 AaxC, but not the L2/434
AaxC proteins. Therefore the AAX system appears to be
undergoing inactivation in parallel among the C. trachomatis strains. Transcription of these nonfunctional genes
suggests that bioinformatic analysis underestimates the
number of inactive genes in organisms undergoing reductive evolution. Neither a comparison of dN/dS values nor
amino acid substitution analysis was sufficiently sensitive
or specific to detect recent gene inactivation by missense
mutations.

post-infection. As a control, cDNAs also were prepared
from RNA isolated from a mock infection, containing
only host cells. Amplification of an intragenic region of
the constitutively expressed hsp60 gene confirmed the specificity and sensitivity of the analysis (Figure 2C). Amplification of intragenic regions of the aaxA, aaxB, or aaxC
cDNAs showed significant levels of expression 24 and 46
h post-infection, but failed to detect expression during the
early stage at 8 h (Figure 2D). Therefore, all three genes of
the AAX system are preferentially transcribed at the midor late-stages of infection, when EBs begin to form. These
results are consistent with expression profiles reported
from microarray studies of global gene expression
[23,25]. Although the semi-quantitative transcript analysis shown in Figure 2D indicates that levels of aaxC expression are the same or lower than aaxA levels, we cannot
rule out the possibility of multiple, unidentified promoters in this gene cluster.

Results and discussion
Expression of the aax genes in C. trachomatis L2/434
cDNAs were prepared from chlamydial cells harvested 24
h post-infection. PCR amplification of intergenic regions
showed that the aaxA and aaxB genes were transcribed on
the same mRNA, as were the aaxB and aaxC genes (Figure
2A and 2B). No amplified product was detected for the
region upstream of aaxA or downstream of aaxC, suggesting that these three genes are coordinately transcribed in a
single operon. A canonical Shine-Dalgarno sequence
(ribosome binding site) preceded each putative initiator
codon. The aaxABC gene cluster is conserved in all
Chlamydia spp. genome sequences, and this operon is predicted to coordinately express all three genes from a polycistronic mRNA.

To determine the time course of aaxABC expression,
cDNAs were prepared from RNA isolated 8, 24 or 46 h

Analysis of aaxABC expression in C. trachomatis L2/434. Part A shows a map of the putative CTL0626-CTL0628
operon, comprising the aaxABC gene cluster. Both intragenic regions (bars 1–3 shown in red) and intergenic regions (bars A-D
shown in blue) were amplified by RT-PCR. Part B shows PCR amplification products for the intergenic regions identified in part
A using either cDNA, prepared from 24 h cultures of C. trachomatis L2/434, or chromosomal DNA as a template. Part C shows
the PCR amplification products for the constitutively expressed hsp60 gene, using cDNA prepared from uninfected cells
(mock) or C. trachomatis L2-infected cells harvested at the indicated hours post infection (hpi). Control reactions were performed using DNA (left lanes) or omitting reverse transcriptase (-RT) prior to PCR analysis. Part D shows gene-specific RTPCR products to semi-quantitatively assess transcript levels during the course of infection. The numbered reactions correspond to the regions shown in part A. Control DNA reactions are shown in the left-hand lanes of each section, next to mock
infection controls. Marker lanes (M) shows bands corresponding to 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 or 1.0 kbp DNA standards, as indicated. All
PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose electrophoresis gels and stained using ethidium bromide. The images were
cropped, inverted and adjusted for contrast and brightness using Photoshop CS3 software (Adobe).

Heterologous expression of AaxB from L2 and D strains
To test whether the L2/434 CTL0627 (aaxB) gene encodes
an active, truncated AaxB protein or is a true pseudogene,
the CTL0627 and CTL0628 (aaxC) genes were cloned in a
multi-copy plasmid vector. An E. coli strain missing the
native adiAYC arginine uptake and decarboxylase genes
was used to express AaxB fused to amino-terminal T7epitope and hexahistidine tags, and untagged AaxC.
Immunoblotting found no epitope-tagged protein in
lysates of this strain (Figure 3), and no arginine decarboxylase activity was detected in cell-free extracts. Therefore
the L2/434 aaxB homolog acts as a pseudogene in E. coli.
No candidate for a suppressor tRNA was reported in the
L2/434 genome sequence [10] or identified using the
tRNAscan-SE program (ver. 1.23, general, cove only
model) [26].

For comparison, the CT373 (aaxB) and CT374 (aaxC)
genes from C. trachomatis D/UW-3 were expressed from

Full-length AaxB proteins were detected in immunoblots of E. coli extracts using T7-Tag monoclonal

coli DEG0147 (pDG479), containing the wild-type L2/434
aaxB pseudogene fused to an amino-terminal T7-Tag. Lane 2
contained 30 μg extract from E. coli DEG0147 (pDG543)
expressing the X128W variant of aaxB from strain L2/434.
Lane 3 contained protein size standards (without an epitope

of AaxB from strain L2, including a small amount of cleaved
β-subunit. Lane 5 contained 117 μg extract from E. coli
DEG0147 (pBAD/HisA) as a negative control. Lane 6 contained 72 μg extract from E. coli DEG0147 (pDG558)

expression or cleavage, and it was processed as described for

the same vector, producing T7-tagged AaxB protein in cell
lysates (Figure 3). However, this pyruvoyl-dependent
arginine decarboxylase must be cleaved to produce active
enzyme, and no epitope-tagged cleavage product was
detected by immunoblotting. Presumably due to the lack
of self-cleavage, no arginine decarboxylase activity was
detected in these cell-free extracts either. In contrast, the C.
pneumoniae AaxB protein was significantly activated in E.
coli [18].
Restoration of AaxB activity by site-directed mutagenesis
The C. trachomatis AaxB protein sequences share 89%
amino acid identity and 97% similarity with the active C.
pneumoniae ortholog (Figure 1). Therefore site-directed
mutagenesis was used to replace the ochre codon at position 128 of the L2/434 aaxB pseudogene with a tryptophan codon that is found in the C. pneumoniae and
other C. trachomatis homologs. This X128W variant protein
was expressed at high levels in E. coli extract, and the affinity-purified protein contained epitope-tagged β-subunit
(Figure 3). This purified protein contained a mixture of
proenzyme and 41% cleaved protein forming α- and βsubunits (Figure 4), compared to 57% cleaved protein
from C. pneumoniae. The purified X128W variant protein
catalyzed the decarboxylation of L-arginine with a pH
optimum near 3.4, as observed for the C. pneumoniae AaxB
[18]. Accounting for only the cleaved portion of protein,
this X128W variant had a KM of 5.4 mM and a kcat of 2.3 s1, compared to a K of 5.0 mM and a turnover of 6.9 s-1 for
M
C. pneumoniae AaxB.

Affinity-purified AaxB from D/UW-3 contained only
proenzyme (Figure 4), yet this protein differs from the
active X128W L2/434 protein in only two amino acid positions (Figure 1). The Val155Ile substitution is conservative,
and probably reflects the ancestral state. However, a
Gly115Arg substitution occurred after the divergence of the
C. trachomatis L2 and A-D serovars. In the structure of the
homologous arginine decarboxylase from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii [27], the corresponding Ile107 residue is
found near the N-terminal end of β-strand 6 in the α-subunit. This strand forms the edge of one sheet in the αββα
sandwich fold, and provides the Glu109 carboxylate group
that facilitates cleavage in this protein family [28]. The
Gly115Arg replacement in C. trachomatis AaxB could alter
the conformation of this β-strand, inhibiting cleavage. To
test the significance of this substitution, site-directed
mutagenesis was used to construct an Arg115Gly variant of
the D/UW-3 protein. The affinity-purified protein was
61% cleaved, and it catalyzed L-arginine decarboxylation
with a rate of 1.3 s-1 (Figure 4).

arginine [17]. To test the function of C. trachomatis AaxC
proteins, arginine uptake assays were performed using E.
coli cells expressing the aaxBC genes from L2/434 and D/
UW-3 strains (Figure 5). No significant arginine uptake
was detected in cells expressing L2/434 wild-type or
X128W aaxBC genes. However, cells expressing D/UW-3
strain aaxBC genes showed significantly enhanced uptake.
Although the L2/434 and D/UW-3 AaxC proteins are 99%
identical, the 7 amino acid substitutions appear to have
reduced the L2/434 protein's transport activity. These substitutions are scattered across the protein sequence, and
none occurs at a conserved site in an alignment of
homologs.

frequency of missense mutations may be much higher these proteins can still be expressed, and they may fold
correctly, yet they can be functionally impaired [29]. Several strategies have been developed to identify detrimental
missense mutations, using either protein structure models
or comparative sequence analysis to predict the effects of
amino acid substitutions [15]. These models show great
promise in predicting the effects of nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in well-characterized
human genes [30]. When the predicted ancestral C. trachoPage 6 of 13

Figure 6
The chlamydial aaxABC genes have been vertically inherited and maintained under selective pressure
The chlamydial aaxABC genes have been vertically inherited and maintained under selective pressure. The phylogeny of chlamydial 16S ribosomal RNA genes (shown at the upper left) was inferred by the maximum likelihood method
using the PhyML program to analyze aligned sequences from the ribosomal database project (RDP) [33,54]. Bootstrap values
from 1000 replicates are shown in red for each lineage supported by a plurality of trees, and this tree was rooted using the
Parachlamydia sp. UWE25 rRNA sequence. A tree calculated by the weighbor method has the same topology (phylogram from
RDP not shown). The phylogenies of the aaxA, aaxB and aaxC genes and dN/dS values for each lineage (shown in red) were
inferred using maximum likelihood methods, as described in the text. No dN/dS values are shown for lineages with fewer than
0.05 nucleotide substitutions per codon. For each tree, the scale bar indicates the number of nucleotide substitutions per position.

matis AaxB sequence (Figure 1) was submitted to the Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT) web server http://
sift.jcvi.org/, the G115R replacement was "predicted to
affect protein function" [31]. However, when the C. pneumoniae AaxB sequence was submitted to the SIFT web
server with a list of 22 observed replacements in the C. trachomatis sequence, all of the changes were predicted to be
"tolerated." The G115R replacement alone also was predicted to be tolerated in the C. pneumoniae AaxB sequence.
The PMUT server http://mmb2.pcb.ub.es:8080/PMut/
predicted 8 of the 22 replacements (including G115R) to

be "pathological" for the C. pneumoniae sequence [32].
Therefore these amino acid substitution prediction tools
are neither sensitive nor specific enough to predict functional changes due to missense mutations in significantly
diverged bacterial sequences.
Since we could not recognize specific missense mutations
that impair function, we considered whether aberrant
phylogenies or high rates of nonsynonymous substitution
correspond to loss of function. Phylogenies of the aaxABC
genes have the same topologies as the 16S ribosomal RNA

tree (Figure 6) [33]. The intact aaxABC genes from Chlamydia psittaci 6BC are highly similar to their C. abortus
homologs, containing several conservative amino acid
replacements (data not shown). These results are consistent with previous protein-sequence based phylogenies
that indicated the three genes were acquired by the
Chlamydiaceae ancestor through horizontal gene transfer
after its divergence from the Parachlamydiaceae [17,18]. To
measure the effects of purifying selection on these genes,
dN/dS values were calculated for each branch. Genes sub-

Reference or source

ject to negative selection often have low dN/dS values due
to the costs of nonsynonymous substitutions, while genes
under relaxed selection can have dN/dS values approaching
1; genes under positive selection for diversification occasionally have dN/dS values greater than 1 [34]. In a canonical model for gene loss and decay in intracellular
bacteria, inactivating mutations that are fixed in a population give rise to pseudogenes that evolve neutrally, with a
high frequency of deletions, increased dN/dS values and
biased GC to AT mutations [35,36].

For branches in the aaxA gene tree, dS values ranged from
< 0.005 (among the C. trachomatis strains) to 66 (saturation, separating the Chlamydophila and Chlamydia lineages). dN/dS values range from 0.002 to more than 1, with
the majority of lineages showing purifying selection (Figure 6). The highly diverged amino-terminal secretory signal sequence in C. trachomatis homologs accounted for
most of the nonsynonymous substitutions. Otherwise,
the dN/dS values for aaxA homologs are consistent with
those of the major outer membrane protein (MOMP)
porin. The dN/dS value was 0.114 for the C. trachomatis D/
UW-3 and C. pneumoniae MOMP pair, and 0.144 for the
C. trachomatis D/UW-3 and L2/434 MOMP sequences.
From these data we infer that aaxA orthologs have been
subjected to moderate purifying selection, punctuated by
a dramatic change in the secretory signal region of the
ancestral C. trachomatis and C. muridarum gene. Signal
sequences can vary significantly among homologous proteins [37], so further experiments will be required to test
whether these changes in the signal sequence alter protein
localization or expression levels. A future site-based comparison of codon substitution rates could identify specific
positions subject to relaxed selection, but will require
many more aaxA sequences.
Despite the inactivating nonsense and missense mutations in C. trachomatis aaxB genes, the dS values for aaxB
genes ranged from < 0.00005 in the C. trachomatis lineage
to 14 separating the Chlamydia and Chlamydophila strains.
There are correspondingly few nonsynonymous substitu-

Size (bp)

tions, so dN/dS values are uniformly low (Figure 6). The
frequency of GC versus AT nucleotides was not substantially different at any codon position in the inactivated
genes. As observed for several Rickettsial pseudogenes,
gene inactivation does not always correspond to higher
dN/dS values [38]. The aaxC gene also shows no sign of
relaxed selection, even in the C. trachomatis lineages with
saturating synonymous substitution rates. Although
homologs in C. trachomatis B/Jali and A/HAR-13 strains
have 2 or 3 deletions, respectively, there are no other
nucleotide substitutions compared to the D/UW-3 strain.
Neutral evolution may be difficult to detect following
such recent gene inactivation.
Parallel loss of AAX activity in C. trachomatis strains
correlates with modes of infection
While the AAX system from C. pneumoniae functions in E.
coli, we have demonstrated that several homologous C.
trachomatis genes have experienced inactivating mutations. The pathogenic Chlamydiales form two distinct phylogenetic groups: the Chlamydophila and Chlamydia genera
[39]. The latter includes C. trachomatis and Chlamydia
muridarum, a strain that causes mouse pneumonitis. An
alignment of AaxB sequences shows that the C. muridarum
homolog contains none of the deleterious mutations
found in C. trachomatis genes, so it should form an active
arginine decarboxylase (Figure 1). Furthermore, a peptide
from the AaxC transporter of this strain was identified
bound to MHC class I molecules from infected murine
dendritic cells [40]. These data indicate the chlamydial

ancestor had a functional AAX system, but independent
mutations in the C. trachomatis homologs are progressively inactivating these genes. Recent demonstrations of
gene transfer and recombination among chlamydiae temper the correlation between serotype and AAX functionality [13]. Future sequences from clinical isolates and
additional chlamydial species will help define the distribution and evolution of the AAX system.
In early stage acute respiratory infections, C. pneumoniae
EBs infect granulocytes and alveolar macrophages, which
both use arginine to produce nitric oxide [41-43]. Therefore the AAX system may be selected for its ability to
reduce L-arginine levels and nitric oxide synthase activity
during infection. C. pneumoniae, unlike C. trachomatis, can
infect and replicate in neutrophil granulocytes [44]. C. trachomatis strains rarely cause pneumonia, except in infants,
who have immature alveolar macrophages [45]. Instead,
C. trachomatis strains primarily infect mucosal epithelial
cells, which do not express the inducible nitric oxide synthase; however, disseminating C. trachomatis L2 cells can
persist in unactivated macrophages [46]. Consistent with
this model, mice deficient in inducible nitric oxide synthase resolved genital C. trachomatis infections as well as
normal mice [47].
A similar relationship between chlamydial strain-specific
metabolism and tissue tropism has been described for
tryptophan biosynthesis. When IFN-γ is produced by the

host during infection, it causes the expression of
indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which degrades Ltryptophan. Genital tract isolates of C. trachomatis serovars
B, D-K and L2 produce tryptophan synthase to make tryptophan from exogenous indole. In contrast, ocular C. trachomatis serovars A, Ba and C contain a deletion mutation
in the trpA gene [48,49]. Despite the inactivating deletion
in trpA, both the trpAB genes are transcribed and translated in a serovar A strain [48]. It has been proposed that
ocular C. trachomatis strains do not encounter indole or
IFN-γ induced IDO during infection [50].

Conclusion
The loss of arginine decarboxylase activity in the AaxB
protein from L2/434 was predicted due to a nonsense
mutation, but the inactivation of D/UW-3 AaxB was not
obvious from the protein sequence. Nor could we predict
that the L2/434 AaxC would be inactive, while the D/UW3 AaxC would be active (the two protein sequences are
99% identical). Both aaxBC orthologs are transcribed.
Therefore the AAX system has been inactivated via independent mechanisms in at least two lineages of C. trachomatis. Proteomic evidence suggests that the AaxA outer
membrane protein is produced by L2/434 cells during
infection, but this porin could have additional functions
that are independent of AAX system. These results suggest
a cautious interpretation of gene expression data for species undergoing reductive evolution. Neither sequence
comparison nor transcriptional analysis is sufficient to

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:166

detect all pseudogenes in these bacteria. Furthermore,
recently inactivated genes may not show the hallmarks of
relaxed selection, leading to over prediction of bacterial
metabolic capabilities. Folded into the protein sequence
databases, these inactive sequences may corrupt future
genome annotations and protein-structure function analyses that rely on comparative sequence analysis.

Methods
Strains and DNA
L2 mouse fibroblast cells were grown to confluency in
Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS (complete DMEM) at 37°C in 5%
CO2. These cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 with EBs from C. trachomatis D/UW-3 or
L2/434 (Table 1) [51]. After 46 h incubation, infected cells
were pooled and sonicated to isolate EBs, and chromosomal DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Tissue Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Chlamydia pneumoniae genes were
previously cloned from strain Kajaani 6 [52]. Escherichia
coli DH5α (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or E. coli XL1-Blue
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) strains were used as general
cloning hosts. E. coli BL21(DE3) was used to express genes
from T7 promoters. E. coli DEG0147 was used to express
genes from PBAD promoters.
Cloning
C. trachomatis L2/434 genomic DNA and primers
CTL06263'F and CTL06295'R (Table 2) were used to
amplify a 2.5 kbp DNA fragment containing the CTL0627
(aaxB) and CTL0628 (aaxC) loci plus minimal 5' and 3'
flanking sequences. The purified PCR product was ligated
into plasmid pGEM-T (Promega) to produce vector
pDFclone1. DNA sequencing performed at the Uniformed Services University Biomedical Instrumentation
Center confirmed that the cloned DNA sequence was
identical to the published sequence (GenBank accession
NC_010287), except for a silent T390C mutation in the
CTL0627 locus.

The CTL0627 and CTL0628 genes were amplified from
pDFclone1 by PCR using primers 5CT373X and
3CT374H. The purified product was digested and ligated
into the XbaI and HindIII restriction sites of vector pBAD/
HisA to produce vector pDG479. Sequencing reactions
using the primers pBAD-Fwd2, CTseq1 and pBAD-Rev
confirmed that the cloned sequence was identical to that
found in pDFclone1. The CTL0627 gene was amplified
from pDFclone1 by PCR using primers 5CT373N and
3CT373B. The product was ligated into the NdeI and
BamHI sites of vector pET-19b to produce vector pDG491.
A QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene)
was
used
with
primers
5CT373X128W
and
3CT373X128W to replace the ochre codon 128 of
CTL0627 in pDG479 with a tryptophan codon, resulting
in vector pDG543.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/166

The CT373 (aaxB) gene from C. trachomatis D/UW-3 was
amplified from genomic DNA using the 5CT373N and
3CT373B primers. The resulting product was cloned into
pET-19b to produce vector pTG17, as described for
CTL0627. The CT373 and CT374 (aaxC) genes were
amplified using primers 5CT373X and 3CT374H and
ligated into pBAD/HisA, as described above, to produce
vector pDG558. DNA sequencing at the Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology DNA Core Facility showed
that the DNA cloned in these vectors was identical to the
published sequence (GenBank accession NC_000117).
Site directed mutagenesis was used with primers
5CT373R115G and 3CT373R115G and vector pTG17 to
construct an Arg115Gly substitution in CT373, resulting in
vector pTG20.
Analysis of gene expression
C. trachomatis L2/434 EBs diluted in DMEM were used to
infect confluent L2 mouse fibroblast cells at an MOI of 5
(for 8 h samples) or an MOI of 1 (for 24 and 46 h samples) for 2 h with rocking at 37°C in 5% CO2. Mock infections were performed with DMEM. Following infection,
cells were incubated with complete DMEM supplemented
with 20 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate and 1 μg/ml cycloheximide. Total RNA was harvested at 8, 24, and 46 h using
TRIzol (Invitrogen) as directed by the manufacturer. RNA
harvests were repeated in triplicate for each time period
starting with independent infections. RNA was treated
with amplification grade DNase I (Invitrogen) to remove
contaminating DNA prior to cDNA synthesis. cDNA was
synthesized from the DNase-treated RNA using the ThermoScript RT-PCR System for First-Strand cDNA synthesis
kit from Invitrogen using the random primer protocol.
PCR was performed using PCR MASTER MIX (2×) (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD), 1 μl of cDNA or RNA or 50 ng
of control genomic DNA as template, and 0.5 μM each of
forward and reverse primers (Tables 3 and 4). Thermocycler conditions were 94°C for 2 min, 25 cycles of 94°C for
45 s, 53°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 50 s, and a final extension of 5 min at 72°C. PCR products were analyzed on
1.5% agarose gels and visualized using ethidium bromide
stain.
Heterologous expression and protein purification
E. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing the indicated plasmids
were grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml
ampicillin and induced with 1% α-D-lactose to express
the following decahistidine-tagged proteins: His10CTL0627 (pDG491), His10-CT373 (pTG17), and His10CT373-R115G (pTG20). E. coli DEG0147 cells containing
plasmids derived from pBAD/HisA and induced with
0.2% L-arabinose were used to express the following hexahistidine and T7 epitope-tagged proteins: His6CTL0267–0268
(pDG479),
His6-CTL0627-X128W
(pDG543), and His6-CT373–374 (pDG558). The polyhistidine-tagged proteins were purified using Ni2+-affinity

chromatography and analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) as
described previously [18].
Arginine uptake and decarboxylation assays
The transport of radiolabeled arginine was measured in
whole cells collected by filtration, using a method that we
reported previously [17]. These assays contained 1 × 109
E. coli cells washed and suspended in E medium (pH 5) at
37°C for 20 min with 1 mM L-arginine and 2 μCi L[2,3,4,5-3H]arginine. Arginine decarboxylase activity
measurements using cell-free extracts or purified proteins
were performed as described previously using 40 to 80
nCi L-[1-14C]arginine [18]. 14CO2 was trapped and then
measured by liquid scintillation counting.
Immunoblotting
Proteins were separated on a SDS-PAGE Tris-glycine gel,
followed by electrotransfer to a PVDF membrane (Pall,
Ann Arbor, MI). These blots were blocked with bovine
serum albumin and then incubated for 1 h with a 1:5000
dilution of T7-Tag monoclonal antibody conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase (Novagen, Madison, WI). An
Image Station 4000 instrument (Carestream Health, New
Haven, CT) was used to detect chemiluminescence produced during incubation with SuperSignal West Pico Substrate (Thermo Pierce, Rockford, IL).
Phylogenetic analysis and estimation of nucleotide
substitution rates
Orthologous nucleotide sequences for the aaxA, aaxB and
aaxC genes were retrieved from the GenBank database
(Table 5) and aligned using the ClustalW2 program (ver.
2.0.10) [53]. The phylogeny of the aaxA, aaxB and aaxC
genes was inferred using the PhyML program (ver. 3.0.1)
[54], with the HKY85 nucleotide substitution model, a
discrete gamma model with 4 categories of sites and estimated transition/transversion ratios of 3.9 (aaxA), 4.8
(aaxC) and 6.1 (aaxB). Trees were viewed and edited using
the FigTree program (ver. 1.2.2, A. Rambaut, University of
Edinburgh) and Illustrator CS3 (Adobe). The numbers of
synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS) and
nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site
(dN) were estimated using the codeml program from the
PAML software suite (ver. 4.2) [55], based on the
ClustalW2 alignment and PhyML phylogeny with a free
ratio branch model (ω = dN/dS varies for each branch). A
user tree was supplied to the codeml program, with codon
frequencies calculated from the average nucleotide frequencies at the three codon positions, and with one category in the ω distribution. Both ω and κ parameters were
estimated from the data. The codonml module was also
used with the same parameters to infer the ancestral C. trachomatis AaxB sequence shown in Figure 1[55]. This
ancestral sequence was consistent with a sequence

inferred using the Dnapars program from the Phylip package (ver. 3.66; J. Felsenstein, U. Washington). However,
the Dnapars program reported more ambiguous codons
than the codeonml program. For the analysis of aaxA
genes, translated amino acid sequences were aligned using
ClustalW2, and then a nucleotide sequence alignment
was constructed using the PAL2NAL program (ver. 12)
[56]. Pairwise sequence dN/dS ratios were calculated using
the KaKs_Calculator program (ver. 1.2) [57].

Authors' contributions
TNG carried out the protein expression, purification and
immunoblotting studies, performed some cloning and
mutagenesis experiments, and performed arginine uptake
and decarboxylation assays. DJF cultured Chlamydia, carried out gene expression experiments and initial gene
cloning, and helped to draft the manuscript. DEG conceived of and coordinated the study, performed some
cloning and mutagenesis experiments, phylogenetic and
statistical analysis, and drafted the manuscript. All
authors read and approved the final manuscript.
