Abstract
Background: In silico candidate gene prioritisation (CGP) aids the discovery of gene functions by
ranking genes according to an objective relevance score. While several CGP methods have been
described for identifying human disease genes, corresponding methods for prokaryotic gene
function discovery are lacking. Here we present two prokaryotic CGP methods, based on
phylogenetic profiles, to assist with this task.
Results: Using gene occurrence patterns in sample genomes, we developed two CGP methods
(statistical and inductive CGP) to assist with the discovery of bacterial gene functions. Statistical
CGP exploits the differences in gene frequency against phenotypic groups, while inductive CGP
applies supervised machine learning to identify gene occurrence pattern across genomes. Three
rediscovery experiments were designed to evaluate the CGP frameworks. The first experiment
attempted to rediscover peptidoglycan genes with 417 published genome sequences. Both CGP
methods achieved best areas under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.911 in
Escherichia coli K-12 (EC-K12) and 0.978 Streptococcus agalactiae 2603 (SA-2603) genomes, with an
average improvement in precision of >3.2-fold and a maximum of >27-fold using statistical CGP. A
median AUC of >0.95 could still be achieved with as few as 10 genome examples in each group of
genome examples in the rediscovery of the peptidoglycan metabolism genes. In the second
experiment, a maximum of 109-fold improvement in precision was achieved in the rediscovery of
anaerobic fermentation genes in EC-K12. The last experiment attempted to rediscover genes from
31 metabolic pathways in SA-2603, where 14 pathways achieved AUC >0.9 and 28 pathways
achieved AUC >0.8 with the best inductive CGP algorithms.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that the two CGP methods can assist with the study of
functionally uncategorised genomic regions and discovery of bacterial gene-function relationships.
Our rediscovery experiments also provide a set of standard tasks against which future methods
may be compared.

Background
Identifying gene functions is an important task in
biology. The exponential growth of genome sequences
has placed greater importance on the use of computational approaches for sequence analysis and annotation.
With the development of high-throughput technology,
methods of comparative genomics are increasingly used
to assist with the identification of gene functions [1], as
conventional methods of gene screening using transgenic
organisms are resource intensive and time consuming. In
practice, bench-side researchers frequently encounter
extensive lists of genes that require further pruning and
experimental validation. Accurate prioritisation of candidate genes, therefore, constitutes a key step in
accelerating the discovery of gene functions.
In silico candidate gene prioritisation (CGP) ranks genes
based upon the features associated with genes and the
function of interest. A variety of gene features have been
suggested for the prioritisation of causal genes in human
diseases, including the co-occurrence of gene name and
disease terminology in biomedical texts [2-5], sharing of
terms in annotation or gene ontology databases [2, 4,
6-9], gene expression in different tissues [2, 4, 6],
protein-protein interactions [4], similarity of gene or
protein sequences [8, 9], presence of genes within a
phenotype or diseases database [10], phylogenetic
relationships [11], or a combination of the above [2,
4]. However, to construct a CGP system for prokaryotes,
different forms of gene features are needed, as current
CGP algorithms are skewed towards eukaryotic genomes
and the systematic curation of annotation or genotypephenotype databases are less complete than for eukaryotes. Hundreds of whole genome sequences of bacteria
and thousands of partial genome sequences are available
in public databases, yet prokaryotic genomes display a
higher proportion of genes with unknown function than
eukaryotes [12]. In contrast, several methods for
computational protein function discovery have been
studied, including chromosomal proximity method,
domain fusion analysis, analysis of gene expression
patterns, and phylogenetic profiles [13]. In particular,
the phylogenetic profile method exploits knowledge of
gene occurrences across a range of sequenced genomes
and postulates that genes involved in the same metabolic
pathway are frequently co-inherited. Phylogenetic profiles have been applied to unsupervised clustering of
proteins to discover their functional linkages [14] and to
discover conserved gene clusters in microbes (with
probabilistic phylogenetic tree models) [15]. Supervised
approaches of phylogenetic profiles have also been
applied to infer protein networks (with canonical
correlation analysis [16]) and predicting protein functional class in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (with tree-based
kernels [17]), in the discovery of protein localisation in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/86

eukaryotes [18], in functional annotation of genes (by
correlation enrichments [19]). These studies suggested
that the concept of phylogenetic profiles provides a
valuable tool for predicting gene-function linkage. It was
thus hypothesised that such concept can also be
exploited as gene features for prioritising genes contributing to a particular phenotypic trait of interest, thus
providing a practical and generalisable tool to guide
microbiologists in gene selection.
This paper examines the practical application of the
phylogenetic profile method for gene prioritisation to
investigate its generalisability and applicability on both
simple and complex traits in prokaryotes.
Phylogenetic profiles form an indirect connection between
gene and function in two conceptual steps. The first step
establishes the gene-genome relationship, by examining
the occurrence (presence or absence) of a candidate gene
(or its homolog) in a given genome. The second step
groups genomes according to their known phenotypes. We
investigate two scenarios in which CGP can be useful in
assisting with functional discovery of uncharacterised genes
in prokaryotes. The method of statistical CGP is used when
the occurrence profile can be directly inferred from the
study phenotype, whereas inductive CGP is used when the
profile is obscure but a small number of genes known to
contribute to the study phenotype are available. Candidate
genes are then prioritised by either statistical scoring
functions or supervised machine learning algorithms.
In addition, at present there are no clear benchmarks to
allow comparison between these different approaches to
gene prioritisation, and the extent to which such algorithms
are capable of identifying target genes in bacteria remains
unexplored. This paper takes advantage of selected metabolic processes with a well-understood genetic basis to craft
gold standard prioritisation tasks. The two CGP approaches
are evaluated by rediscovering genes participating in wellcharacterised biochemical pathways – the metabolism of
peptidoglycan, fermentation in anaerobes, and selected
metabolic pathways curated in Kyoto Encyclopaedia of
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [20]. We ultimately aim to
develop metrics that will provide an indication of the
likelihood that highly prioritised genes are strong biological
candidates, and the degree to all potential candidates have
been identified for tasks such as the selection of biomarkers,
the discovery of virulence genes, and the formulation of new
hypotheses about uncharacterised genes.

Methods
Determination of genomic occurrences of
candidate genes
To evaluate the performance of CGP methods, three case
studies were selected for rediscovery experiments using

Page 2 of 12

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:86

well-known pathway genes as gold-standards. For each
case study, the polypeptide sequences of n candidate
genes were compared with all open reading frames (orf)
of the k genome sequences from the National Centre for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI, accessed April 2007)
by Basic Local Alignment and Search Tool (BLASTP)
http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi. If a candidate
gene reached the critical E-value of < 10-5 in a given
genome, a gene or gene homolog was defined as present
in the genome. If a gene did not reach the critical E-value
in a genome, the gene was recorded as absent from the
genome. The binary states of gene occurrence were
recorded in an n × k homolog matrix.
Statistical CGP
¿From the k genomes, kp genomes known to display the
phenotype of interest (p) were selected as positive
genome examples, and kn genomes not displaying p
were chosen as negative genome examples. For each of
the n candidate genes, the number of co-presence
(homologs present in positive genome examples) and
co-absence (homologs absent in negative genome
examples) were counted and presented into a 2 × 2
contingency table, from which a number of statistical
scoring functions was calculated. The scoring functions
included: a) sensitivity (sens, the proportion of genes
present in the positive genome examples), b) specificity
(spec, proportion of genes absent in the negative genome
examples), c) positive and negative predictive values
(ppv/npv, the proportion of positive/negative genomes
were present/absent when the gene was present/absent),
d) arithmetic (amss) and harmonic (hmss) mean of
sensitivity and specificity, e) odds ratio (OR, the odds
of a gene existed in the positive example versus the odds
of a gene was absent in the negative examples), f) chisquare scoring function (chisq, the deviation of the
observed frequency from the expected proportion), g)
directional chi-square function (bchisq, the chisq function with genes that displayed inverse associations be
reversed to the bottom of the rank), and h) F-measure
(F, the harmonic mean of the sensitivity and precision).
The mathematical definitions of these scoring functions
are listed in the Additionl file 1.
Inductive CGP
Inductive CGP ranks genes by finding genes with similar
occurrence pattern across a number of bacterial genomes
using supervised machine learning. A number of genes
known to display a target phenotype or function p were
selected as positive examples for the training set.
Similarly, genes that did not contribute to p were
selected as negative gene examples. The occurrences of
genes in k genome examples were used as features for
model training. Candidate genes were ranked by the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/86

score or posterior probability from the output of the
machine learning classifiers. The machine learning
classifiers included naïve Bayes (NB), logistic regression
(LR; ridge = 10-5), J48 decision tree (J48, pruning
confidence = 0.25), nearest neighbour classifier (IBk,
with inverse distance weighing; k was determined by
leave-one-out cross-validation), alternating decision tree
(ADTree; boosting iteration = 10), support vector
machines (SVM) with polynomial (SVM/Poly; linear
kernel trained by sequential minimal optimisation
algorithm, SMO) and radial basis function (SVM/RBF;
trained by SMO; g = 0.01) kernels. The Waikato
Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) 3.5.6
was used for classifier training [21]. For the purpose of
benchmarking, the generalisation performance of inductive CGP was evaluated by stratified 10-fold crossvalidation: for the n genes used as candidate genes for
prioritisation, all n+ genes from the validation set and
the rest of n- genes not in the validation set were each
randomly divided into 10 subsets. One-tenth of the the
1
genes from each group ( 10 of n+ and n- genes) were
sequentially selected as test set, whereas the rest of the
genes were selected as training set to train inductive
models. The performance of each inductive CGP algorithm was obtained by averaging areas under receiver
operating characteristic curves (AUC) over the 10 runs.
Evaluation of CGP performance
The performance of different CGP methods was evaluated by rediscovery experiments. The relative position
of the ranked candidate gene was measured by percentiles from the top of the rank (pct). The AUCs were
estimated non-parametrically by trapezoidal rule. We
adopted probability enrichment (the relative enrichment
ratio) described by Turner et al [7] to compare the
performance of different statistical CGP scoring functions [see Additional file 1]. The average and maximum
probability enrichments, defined as n folds-improvement in precision above a certain score threshold τ, were
calculated by partial precision (pppv), such that:

Partial prec. at t

= pppv(t )
Num. correct genes >t
=
Num. genes >t

and the average ( h ) and the maximum (hmax) probability enrichments were defined as:

h(t ) =
h =

pppv n(t )
ppv
1

∫ h(t)dt
0

h max = h(t ∗ )

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:86

where t was the rank fraction at threshold τ, ppv was the
overall precision, pppvn(t) was the partial precision at
rank fraction t, and h(t) was at its maximum at t*. Both
AUC and h measure the overall performance of a CGP
task. The rank fraction t* indicates the point above which
correct genes are likely to be found hmax-times more
likely than compared to a random gene list. Evaluation
with hmax is useful to identify cases where a small
proportion of genes is ranked highly but the overall
performance is poor.
Effect of number of genome examples on
CGP performance
Two simulation experiments were performed to investigate the effect of the number of genome examples on
statistical CGP performance (Case study 1, see below).
For the first simulation, the amss scoring function was
repeatedly applied on randomly selected subsets of 417
positive and negative genome examples, using genes
from set M (Case study 1). The number of positive
genome examples (Np) and negative genome examples
(Nn) were gradually increased in each subset. For each
combination of Np and Nn, 25 runs were performed and
the median AUC was obtained. A second simulation was
performed to determine the variability of performance.
Here the proportion of positive and negative genome
examples was kept the same (400:17) and the median
and the range of AUC were then obtained over 1000 runs
for each Np and Nn.

A similar simulation was also performed to determine
the effect of genome example sizes on inductive CGP
performance. Twenty five subsets of N genomes (from
417 genomes) were randomly selected as features with N
increased from 1 to 417. For each N, stratified 10-fold
cross-validations were performed with SVM/Poly using
all genes from SA-2603 genome as candidates. Median
AUCs from 25 random subset of N genomes were
obtained.
The case studies
Case study 1: Identification of genes involved in bacterial
cell wall synthesis
Well-characterised genes responsible for peptidoglycan
biosynthesis and metabolism in bacteria were used for
testing and were grouped into three nested validation
sets [see Additional file 2]. The C (core) validation set
consisted of genes responsible for the synthesis of Nacetylmuramate-pentapeptide from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (murA to murG, and mraY). The B (biosynthesis)
validation set, extended the C set with genes involved in
precursor pathways including N-acetyl-D-glucosamine,
meso-diaminopelamate and D-alanyl-D-alanine, as well
as genes responsible for undecaprenyl phosphate

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/86

biosynthesis and recycling. The M (metabolism) validation set further extended the B set by including genes
responsible for the modification, recycling, and crosslinking of the peptidoglycan such as penicillin-binding
proteins and N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidases [see
Additional file 3]. Genome examples were selected from
the NCBI bacterial genomes catalogue file [22] and
manually verified by one of the authors (RL). Genes in
the validation sets were identified using KEGG [20] and
EcoCyc [23]. Genomes of one Gram positive bacterium
(S. agalactiae 2603 V/R, SA-2603, 2124 genes, GenBank
ID: AE009948) and one Gram negative bacterium (E. coli
K-12, EC-K12, 4134 genes, GenBank ID: U00096) were
selected for prioritisation.
For statistical CGP, 400 genomes of bacteria known to
produce peptidoglycan were selected as positive examples. Genomes of 17 bacterial species lacking cell wall,
including Mycoplasma spp., Ureaplasma spp., Anaplasma
spp., and Phytoplasma spp., were selected as negative
examples [see Additional file 4]. For inductive CGP, the
occurrence of the candidate genes in the same 417
genomes was used as features for machine learning
training. Candidate genes were labelled according to
whether they belong to C, B, and M validation sets. To
compare the effectiveness of statistical CGP, the relative
positions of the peptidoglycan genes were compared
with an unrelated metabolic pathway (glycolysis genes)
acting as the control validation set [see Additional file 5].
Case study 2: Anaerobic mixed acid fermentation genes
Enzymes responsible for anaerobic respiration and
fermentation were identified from pathway databases
[20, 23] and literature searches [24, 25]. Statistical and
inductive CGP methods were used to derive the
occurrence matrix and to rank candidate genes for
anaerobic mixed-acid fermentation in EC-K12. All
genes in EC-K12 were used as candidates for prioritisation. For statistical CGP, 200 bacterial genomes of
known obligatory and facultative anaerobes capable of
performing anaerobic metabolism were selected as
positive genome examples, and 142 genomes of obligatory aerobes that do not perform anaerobic respiration
were applied as negative examples [see Additional file 6].
Methods for genome example selection were identical to
Case study 1. For inductive CGP, the occurrence patterns
of 4134 candidate genes in 342 genomes were obtained
by the methods described above.
Case study 3: KEGG Pathways
To evaluate the generalisability of inductive CGP, a largescale rediscovery experiment based on the curated KEGG
metabolic pathways was performed [20]. Thirty-one
metabolic pathways with at least 10 genes involved in

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:86

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/86

each pathway were selected for evaluation from the 81
known pathways available for the SA-2603 genome in
KEGG. All seven inductive CGP algorithms were tested,
and the generalisation performance of the algorithms
evaluated by stratified 10-fold cross-validation.

Results
Case study 1: Peptidoglycan-related genes
The best scoring functions for rediscovering metabolic
genes (M set) were the amss, hmss, and npv (AUC >0.970)
using the whole genome of SA-2603 (2124 genes) as
candidate genes. Of the 25 known peptidoglycan-related
genes, all except one gene were identified within the top
13% (median: top 1.0 pct) in SA-2603 (Table 1 and
Figure 1). The top-scored genes in the SA-2603 genome
are listed in [see Additional file 7]. Encouraging results
were also achieved in prioritising the EC-K12 genes in all
three validation sets (Table 2); for example, for the M set
genes in EC-K12 (51 known genes out of 4134 genes in
the bacterial genome), an AUC of 0.911 was achieved by
amss, and the median of the rediscovered genes was at
the top 3.2 pct of the rank. In contrast, poor performances were yielded when matching the control validation sets (glycolysis) against the same amss-prioritised
ranks (SA-2603: 0.398; EC-K12: 0.341; Figure 1).

The performance of statistical CGP was also measured by
folds-increase in precision (probability enrichments)
compared to the non-prioritised rank. With the chisq
scoring function, the ranked gene list achieved an
average enrichment of 3.65 folds (maximum 28.3
folds) for SA-2603 and 3.16 folds for EC-K12 (maximum
27 folds). The probability enrichments of other validation sets are listed in Tables 1 and 2. High AUC values
were obtained from the stratified cross-validations of
inductive CGP experiments. In particular, SVM achieved
near-perfect AUCs in both SA-2603 C and B validation
sets, whereas ADTree had the best AUC of 0.975 in M set
genes (the trained ADTree model is shown in Additional
file 8). Similarly, the best AUC was achieved by SVM/RBF
in the EC-K12 M validation set (0.964). The best AUCs
of 0.998 and 0.981 were also achieved in the rediscovery
of C and B set genes (by IBk and ADTree respectively).
Simulations were performed to investigate the effect of
number of genome examples on statistical CGP performance. The range of AUCs was found to be considerably
broader with fewer genome examples (Figure 2). However, a median AUC (>0.95) could still be achieved with
as few as 10 genome examples in each group in the
rediscovery of the M set genes, compared with a
maximum of 0.97 using all 417 bacterial genomes

(AUC: 0.46–0.77). However, the maximum probability
enrichment was high (up to 108-folds, Table 3). Bacterial
genes specific to anaerobic metabolism were identified
with high ranking scores (the pfl complex: above 0.27 pct;
adhE: 2.1 pct; ackA: 2.1 pct; pta: 12 pct; see Additional files
9 and 10) by amss. In contrast, genes shared with aerobic
respiration, such as the fumerase genes (fumABC) and
the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase gene (ppc), were
ranked much lower (61–96 pct and 57 pct respectively).
For genes encoding the fumarate reductase complex,
there were mixed results: the membrane anchor subunits
(frdCD) were ranked highly (10.1 and 7.8 pct respectively) and the catalytic subunits were placed at the
bottom of the rank (frdAB, 93 and 99 pct). Better overall
performance of inductive CGP was achieved compared
with statistical CGP (AUC: 0.70–0.86). The best AUCs
with inductive prioritisation were produced by IBk and
SVM/Poly algorithms respectively (0.86 and 0.85).

(Figure 3), indicating that the method has considerable
power using even a very small genome sample.
The same simulation performed on inductive CGP (with
SVM/Poly) also achieved an median AUC >0.90 with only
20 genome examples (Figure 4). It was noted, however,
that the AUCs peaked at 70 to 160 genome examples (with
corresponding AUCs between 0.93–0.95) and the performance gradually declined as more genome examples were
added to the profile. Considerable variation of AUC was
also noted when the full 417 genomes were included in the
profile panel (median AUC: 0.872; interquartile range:
0.858–0.898; range: 0.824–0.925).
Case study 2: Anaerobic mixed-acid fermentation genes
Statistical CGP on the anaerobic mixed-acid fermentation rediscovery task for EC-K12 performed poorly

Case study 3: Inductive prioritisation of KEGG
pathway genes
Inductive CGP was conducted on 31 KEGG pathways of
SA-2603 using 7 algorithms. The best supervised
machine learning algorithms identified 14 pathways
(45%) with AUCs >0.90 and 28 pathways (87%) with
AUCs >0.80 (Figure 5 and see Additional file 11). The
best performing algorithm was IBk which had the highest
AUC in 10 pathways. ADTree and SVM/Poly also
performed well, with each producing the best AUC in 8
pathways. SVM/RBF achieved best AUC in 4 pathways.
NB and J48 did not produce a best AUC in any of the 31
pathways studied.

Discussion
Successful prioritisation of bacterial genes by
occurrence-based CGP methods
In this paper, we applied two approaches (statistical and
inductive CGP) to prioritise candidate genes for functional discovery, based on the occurrence patterns of
candidate genes in a selected set of bacterial genomes
(phylogenetic profiles). Our findings demonstrate that
both CGP methods can rediscover genes with high
accuracy in two selected genomes of E. coli K-12 and S.
agalactiae 2603 (Figure 3).

Interestingly, these methods seem relatively insensitive
to the number of genome examples. In the peptidoglycan example with statistical CGP (case study 1), we were
able to identify peptidoglycan genes with high accuracy,
despite only a limited number of sequenced genomes
among negative examples. For inductive CGP, increasing
profile dimension beyond 200 genome examples apparently resulted in a decrease in subsequent median AUCs,
implying that a proportion of genome examples was less

peptidoglycan-related genes (amss scoring function).
This figure demonstrates how the number of genome
examples may influence statistical CGP performance (amss
scoring function). The proportion of positive:negative
genome examples were fixed (400:17).

In statistical CGP, we found that the scoring functions
measuring gene occurrence in both positive and negative
genome example groups (amss, hmss, chisq, and bchisq)
consistently outperform the scoring functions that measure
only positive (sens and ppv), negative (spec and npv), or partial
(F-measure) frequencies of the groups. This finding highlights the importance of including both positive and negative
examples in comparative genomic studies. In inductive CGP,
the rediscovery experiments favoured ADTree, IBk, and SVM s
when compared with other algorithms. In case study 1, the
performance of the best inductive and statistical CGP
methods are comparable, suggesting that both approaches
are capable of producing robust results.
Statistical CGP rediscovers genes specific to the

Line plot illustrating the effect of number of genome
examples on the inductive CGP performance. This figure
shows the effect of AUC versus number of genome examples in
inductive CGP (SVM/Poly algorithm) on Streptococcus agalactiae
2603 genes related to peptidoglycan metabolism (M validation

AUC, the grey solid lines indicate the upper and lower quartiles,
and the dotted grey lines indicate the maximum and minimum
AUC of the simulation runs.

Thirty-eight known genes were labelled as known (out of 4131 genes of
the EC-K12 genome). The AUC in inductive CGP were calculated using
stratified 10-fold cross-validation. Abbreviations: sens: sensitivity; spec:

pathway. For example, by comparing the cell-walled
bacteria with cell wall-less Mycoplasma spp. (case study
1), it was expected that the peptidoglycan genes, which
are specific for the phenotypic trait, were among the
genes lost in this evolutionary lineage [27] (See
Additional file 12). Such genes were ranked very highly
and yielded favourable aggregated performance (with
AUC >0.95). In contrast, results from our anaerobic
fermentation experiment (case study 2) suggested that
genes specific to anaerobic respiration were placed very
highly on the rank (hmax > 95-fold), whereas genes
sharing with the obligatory aerobic bacteria (negative
examples) were ranked much lower. As these shared
genes are present in both phenotypic groups, finding
these "shared" genes by applying only statistical CGP is a
challenging task. Alternative methods are needed to aid
in the discovery of such non-specific genes.
Evolutionary pressure may contribute to specific gene
occurrence patterns
Both occurrence-based CGP methods performed well,
suggesting the genes encoding for a complex phenotype
are frequently co-present and co-absent across the
genomes, forming specific occurrence patterns, thus
allowing the functional predictions. This co-occurrence
phenomenon may reflect the process of natural selection
and the adaptation of microorgranisms into different
evolutionary niches.

genomes. For a complex phenotype encoded by multiple
genes, the deletion of a critical gene could result in the
non-expression of phenotype, leading to the subsequent
loss of other non-functional genes over time. Thus, the
differential co-occurrence patterns in genes can be
exploited for comparative genomics studies, as demonstrated by our methods, in assisting our understanding
of gene functions.

Factors affecting CGP performance
Sampling biases
Prioritising candidate genes with reliance on gene
features from literature, ontology, or annotation as
background knowledge may introduce literature or
annotation biases [2, 4, 9]. While we minimised such
biases, several sources of sampling bias could have limited
the performance of our gene prioritisation methods.
With statistical CGP, accuracy can be affected by ad hoc
selection of examples, especially by the choice of positive
and negative genome examples representing the variations in the study phenotype. With inductive CGP,
performance may be impeded by incorporating inconsistent (or wrong) genes in the training set. Increasing
the heterogeneity of the training genes may adversely
influence prioritisation performance. An example can be
found in a slight decrease of performance (in median
AUC) from C to M validation sets in the peptidoglycan
experiments in EC-K12 candidates, as shown in Figure 1.

The performance of inductive CGP in prioritising 31
KEGG metabolic pathways. The AUCs attempted by
stratified 10-fold cross-validations were obtained by the
rediscovery experiment in Case study 3. Genes of 31 metabolic
pathways of S. agalactiae 2603 genome were obtained from
KEGG and rediscovered by 7 machine learning algorithms.

For bacteria undergoing positive selection, the acquisition
of a particular gene group may result in phenotypes
conferring survival advantage for the microorganism to
adapt to a new environment. It has been known that genes
contributing to symbiosis or pathogenesis are frequently
organised into genomic islands, in which gene mobility is
facilitated by horizontal gene transfer, conferring the ability
to form a new relationship with the host [28]. The good
AUC achieved by inductive CGP in KEGG pathways (case
study 3) suggests specific functional co-occurrence patterns
of genes do exist, regardless of the physical proximity of the
genes or the presence of a mobile genetic structure.
Similarly, negative selection can also contribute to the
co-absence of functional gene units across multiple

Using KEGG as a validation data source
There were considerable variations in inductive CGP
performances across different KEGG categories (Case
study 3). By manually inspecting the worst-performing
functional category (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis), we found the phenylalanine and
tyrosine tRNA synthases genes were also included in the
validation set. The tRNA synthases have roles downstream of the biosynthesis pathways and thus are not
involved in the anabolism of these essential amino acids.
Removal of the unrelated genes improved overall
performance (with best AUC of 0.852 achieved by
SVM/Poly, see Additional file 13). This contrasts with
the best-performing pathways (for example, fatty acid
biosynthesis and peptidoglycan synthesis pathways)
where only function-specific genes were included in the
validation set. Since KEGG is a commonly-used resource
for benchmarking computational methods of functional
discovery [15, 16, 26], our finding suggests that careful
selection must be practised in constructing validation
sets, as mixture of distinct functional groups could lead
to inconsistent results. This specific sampling bias needs
to be considered when explaining variations in the
predicting of gene functions by in silico methods.

The inclusion of paralogs in the occurrence matrix
Reciprocal best BLAST matches are frequently used in the
search for orthologous genes. In our experiments, we
applied non-reciprocal BLAST E-value < 10-5 as the
criterion for determining the sequence similarity
between genes. While our results supported its use in
functional discovery at the gene level, the use of such
criterion may include many paralogs and may affect
prioritisation performance of large gene families with
diverse functions. Detecting and excluding paralogs may
be required to refine the gene ranking and warrant
further studies.

Conclusion
We developed a statistical and an inductive computational
gene prioritisation methods, based on the concept of gene
occurrence across a range of genomes, to improve the search
efficiency in the functional discovery of bacterial genes. We
designed a range of rediscovery experiments for benchmarking different CGP approaches. Promising results were
yielded from the testing on the rediscovery of peptidoglycan-related genes, mixed-acid fermentation genes, and a
diverse range of bacterial metabolic pathways. These CGP
methods could be generalised to other functional discovery
tasks when a pair of positive and negative datasets are
available (statistical CGP) or when a subset of genes with
known functions can be used for training machine learning
models (inductive CGP). With more genome sequences
become available, we anticipate the demand of such
methods will grow as many different scenarios can be
formulated and analysed. In summary, occurrence-based
gene prioritisation method offers a simple yet effective
framework for ranking candidate genes for functional
discovery in prokaryotes. In addition, our experimental
framework should provide a standardised benchmark for
evaluating future CGP methods and algorithms when
prioritising bacterial candidate genes.

Potential sampling biases resulting from inaccurate selection of
validation sets. There were considerable variations in inductive
CGP performance in Case study 3, and some variations is
attributable to statistical uncertainties or algorithmic differences.
The influence of pathway functions on CGP performance was, however,
unclear. Nevertheless, it was observed that there may be limitations in
using KEGG pathways as a validation source, where potential sampling
biases could have explained a significant proportion of such variations.
In this file, an additional experiment was performed to illustrate this
effect.
