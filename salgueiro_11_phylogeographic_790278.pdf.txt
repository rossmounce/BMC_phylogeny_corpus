Braziliense Camb. (Calophyllaceae) based on the
psbA-trnH cpDNA locus

Background
Past climate changes have severely influenced the current distribution of species and their genetic diversity.
Phylogeography is the study of the principles and processes governing the geographic distributions of genealogical lineages [1]. South America has the world’s
largest area of swamps, floodplains and wetlands in general [2]. Brazil’s major wetlands cover 2% of the country’s huge territory [3]. However, from a plant ecology
standpoint, Brazilian freshwater wetlands are largely
unknown and the scarce data available refer mostly to
flooded forests of the Amazon [4]. Calophyllum Braziliense Camb. (Calophyllaceae), also know as guanandi,
jacareúba or landim, is a canopy tree species typical of
waterlogged areas from South and Central America.
This species occurs in the humid tropical forests of
Central America, Amazon Forests, Atlantic Forest
(including restingas); and in the riverines forests of the
Cerrado biome (brazilian savannah) [5,6]. However,
unlike other species typical of flooded areas, C. Braziliense shows none of the morphological features common to flood-adapted plants. Calophyllum Braziliense is
a hermaphroditic tree pollinated by bees. Its seeds are
animal (mainly by bats) or water dispersed. The timber
has excellent characteristics and is widely used. Calophyllum. Braziliense is also used in vegetation restoration programs and its leaves extract presents antiinflammatory activity [7]. This study examines the phylogeographic patterns of C. Braziliense based on the
cpDNA intergenic region psbA-trnH.

Methods
Twenty four populations of C. Braziliense were sampled
from Costa Rica (10° 12’N, 83° 47’W) to the Paraná
State in Brazil (25° 34’S, 48° 27’W). Samples were collected from about 5-10 adult trees in each population,
totaling 192 individuals. Total DNA was extracted from
leaves or cambium using the CTAB procedure described
by Doyle & Doyle [8]. After a screening for cpDNA
amplification and polymorphism in C. Braziliense, the
psbA-trnH intergenic regions was selected [9].
Sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL-W implemented in the MEGA 4 software. The cpDNA haplotypes
were defined by analyzing the sequences with DNASP
4.01. The genetic diversity indexes were estimated in
ARLEQUIN 3.01. The phylogenetic relationships among
the haplotypes were estimated using the median-joining
algorithm implemented in NETWORK 4.1. An analysis
of molecular variance (AMOVA) was performed in
ARLEQUIN. A spatial analysis of molecular variance
(SAMOVA) was conduced using the SAMOVA 1.0 software. To evaluate the hypothesis of population expansion, neutrality tests were computed in DNASP and
ARLEQUIN.
Results
A total of 263 aligned positions were obtained for the
psbA-trnH locus. Twenty-eight variable characters were
analyzed resulting in seven cpDNA haplotypes (Figure
1). The haplotype diversity (h) for each population ranged from 0.0 to 0.533 and the nucleotide diversity (π)
from 0.0 to 0.01882. Similar levels of genetic diversity
were observed for other tropical species [10,11]. Most of
the Atlantic rain forest populations (13/14) are monomorphic and present the same haplotype (H1). Generally, the remaining populations present different private

haplotypes. Spatial analysis of molecular variance
(SAMOVA) identified seven phylogroups (k=7, Fct =
0,926), one consisting of 13 monomorphic populations
from the Brazilian Atlantic rain forest and more three
populations from de Cerrado biome. Most of the others
populations constitute different phylogroups. Neutrality
tests suggest expansion for the Atlantic rain forest
populations. The AMOVA analysis reveals that most of
the variation was found between populations (0.8788,
p<0.00005). A great genetic distance was observed
between Central America (Costa Rica) and the others
populations, even from the Brazilian Amazon forest.
Similar results were observed when Swietenia macrophylla (mahogany) populations from Central and South
America were compared [10].

Conclusions
The genetic data obtained here for C. Braziliense based
on chloroplast DNA diversity indicate a recent expansion for the Atlantic rain forest populations. Our results
suggest that the Northeast of Brazil maintained large

populations during the last glacial period and that the
Southeast and South populations may have undergone a
pronounced retraction process, followed by a recolonization process with a strong founder effect. Thus, the
recolonization of the South and Southeast region of the
Atlantic rain forest probably occurred from these more
stable areas in the Northeast.
