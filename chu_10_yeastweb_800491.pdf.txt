Abstract
Background: Currently, a number of yeast genomes with different physiological features have been sequenced and
annotated, which provides invaluable information to investigate yeast genetics, evolutionary mechanism, structure
and function of gene families.
Description: YeastWeb is a novel database created to provide access to gene families derived from the available yeast
genomes by assigning the genes into putative families. It has many useful features that complement existing
databases, such as SGD, CYGD and Génolevures: 1) Detailed computational annotation was conducted with each entry
with InterProScan, EMBOSS and functional/pathway databases, such as GO, COG and KEGG; 2) A well established userfriendly environment was created to allow users to retrieve the annotated genes and gene families using functional
classification browser, keyword search or similarity-based search; 3) Workset offers users many powerful functions to
manage the retrieved data efficiently, associate the individual items easily and save the intermediate results
conveniently; 4) A series of comparative genomics and molecular evolution analysis tools are neatly implemented to
allow users to view multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic tree of gene families. At present, YeastWeb holds
the gene families clustered from various MCL inflation values from a total of 13 available yeast genomes.
Conclusions: Given the great interest in yeast research, YeastWeb has the potential to become a useful resource for the
scientific community of yeast biologists and related researchers investigating the evolutionary relationship of yeast
gene families. YeastWeb is available at http://centre.bioinformatics.zj.cn/Yeast/.
Background
Yeast biology studies have been greatly accelerated since
the sequencing of the first yeast genome Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. Undoubtedly, the availability of a complete
yeast genome provides invaluable information to investigate yeast genetics, evolutionary mechanism, structure
and function of gene families. As a consequence, publicly
available comprehensive bioinformatics databases and
tools need to be established for retrieving various
genome-level sequence data to facilitate highly rapid
progress in yeast biology research. First and foremost in
the yeast community, for example, the Saccharomyces
Genome Database (SGD) and the MIPS Comprehensive
Yeast Genome Database (CYGD) are public resources
with integrated genetic, genomic, and functional data of

the budding yeast S. cerevisiae [1,2]. The Comparative
Fungal Genomics Platform (CFGP) was developed to
allow access fungal genome sequences and support comparative genomics analyses [3]. Génolevures is a online
database, which allow users to perform comparative
genomics and molecular evolution investigation of hemiascomycetous yeasts [4].
Currently, the emergence of high-throughput sequencing technologies has remarkably sped up whole-genome
de novo sequencing in a rapid and cost-effective fashion.
At present, there are 13 yeast genomes with different
physiological features available on the KEGG database
[5]. Such genome data resources have provided us a
golden opportunity to investigate the yeast genes and
gene families and further their evolutionary and functional implication. In this study, a well-organized database YeastWeb is specifically constructed to provide
various detailed information of genes and gene families
from the available yeast genomes. It has many useful fea-

tures that complement existing databases, such as SGD,
CYGD and Génolevures. Each gene and gene family entry
is extensively annotated by scanning through InterProScan, EMBOSS and functional/pathway databases
such as COG, KEGG and Gene Ontology. Through the
design of workset, all of the retrieved data is well integrated and the intermediate work result can be easily
saved for future use. In addition, YeastWeb can help
researchers to elucidate the evolutionary relationships of
yeast gene families and to carry out in-depth comparative
sequences analyses. Given the great interest in yeast
research, YeastWeb has the potential to become a useful
resource available for the scientific community of yeast
biologists and related researchers.

Construction and content
Gene family assignment

The available 13 yeast genome sequences were obtained
from the KEGG database [5]. These genomes are S. cerevisiae (5,880 genes), S. bayanus (9,344 genes), K. waltii
(5,213 genes), V. polyspora (5,336 genes), Y. lipolytica
(6,472 genes), S. paradoxus (8,908 genes), A. gossypii
(4,725 genes), D. hansenii (6,324 genes), C. albicans
(6,317 genes), S. mikatae (8,972 genes), K. lactis (5,335
genes), P. stipitis (5,816 genes) and C. glabrata (5,191
genes). To assign the proteins into families, an all-againstall BLAST search was conducted for all the predicted
proteins from the 13 yeast genomes using the BLASTP
program (-e = 10-5, -b = 10,000, -v = 10,000). Then, the
protein families were generated using the TribeMCL program [6]. The TribeMCL program is proved to be rather
accurate since it considered the multidomains, fragments
of proteins and promiscuous domains during the clustering process [7]. Under different inflation values of 1.5, 2.5,
3.0, 4.0 and 5.0, a total number of 83,833 proteins derived
from all the 13 yeast genomes were clustered into 18,275,
22,698, 23,839, 25,422 and 26,457 families, respectively.
All these sequence family data is available for free download without any restriction. Furthermore, the download
page provides the utilities to batch download nucleic acid
and/or amino acid sequences according to MCL inflation
value, cluster size and species.

Utility
Workset configuration and data retrieval

A key feature of YeastWeb is that its web interface has
been well organized and presented in the form of workset
(Fig. 1). Through the workset, all the data sets in the
YeastWeb can be easily linked together and the intermediate work result can be saved. For the data stored in the
workset, a succession of analyses can be achieved using a
number of implemented comparative genomics and
molecular evolution analysis tools. Prior to construction
of a personalized workset, genes or gene families could be
first retrieved using functional classification browsers,
keyword searches or BLAST searches.
The browse function allows users to visualize gene families that are in the same COG functional category or
KEGG metabolic pathway (Fig. 1). COG and KEGG function categories assignment of a given category in YeastWeb is pre-computed using the BLAST program with an
E-value of 1e-5. Once users click a given COG category or
KEGG metabolic pathway (organized hierarchically), a
list of genes belonging to such category will be presented.
Then, users can select specific or all of the retrieved items
and add them to the workset.
The search function is available to allow users to access
the genes and gene families by keyword. Four searching
options are available in the search page: gene information, cluster information, KEGG metabolic pathway
information and COG functional category information.
For gene information, users can retrieve genes of interest
based on their gene ID and function description. For cluster information, users can access the interested gene fam-

Database construction

YeastWeb is designed as a relational database and hosted
on an Apache HTTP server running on Linux operating
system. YeastWeb web interface is implemented in an
operating-system independent way and has been tested
to work well in Internet Explorer 6.0, Firefox 3.0.1, and
Opera 10.00 browsers. All the annotations for the genes
and genes families are organized into various separate
MySQL database tables, which can be retrieved by the
Structure Query Language (SQL) easily. PHP is used to

Figure 1 Screenshots of data retrieval and workset configuration.
Users can base on functional classification browser, keyword search or
similarity-based search to retrieve yeast gene families. All the retrieved
results can be added into the workset for

Chu et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:429
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/429

ilies based on cluster ID, cluster size and cluster
description associated with different MCL inflation values. For the KEGG metabolic pathway and COG functional category information, user can retrieve interest
genes based on pathway/COG ID or description. The
retrieved item shows classification information, including
gene ID, function definition, species and cluster ID under
different inflation values. Genes, gene families and
related information retrieved from all of these ways can
be added into the workset by clicking the "Add to workset" button.
The BLAST tool implemented in YeastWeb works as a
useful way to enable the users to search their target
sequences or identify homologs in the database. Users
can select one or more yeast genomes to perform the
sequence similarity searching with the protein databases
(BLASTP or BLASTX, depending on the query sequence)
or nucleotide databases (BLASTN and TBLASTX or
TBLASTN). In addition, a number of advanced parameters (such as E-value, matrix and species) were also
offered to perform more specific BLAST searches. The
BLAST search results can be visualized in standard
BLAST output format. However, especially, the results
can be easily parsed and navigated according to specific
cut-off of E-value or score set by users with the implement of the ViroBLAST program [8]. All the selected
items can be directly saved into workset by click the "Submit" button.
Workset manipulation and entry description

The workset of YeastWeb works like the Microsoft Excel,
which offers users a numerous number of powerful functions to manipulate the whole workset table and individual table items (Fig. 2). It allows users to load an existing
workset, create a new one, integrate previous records or
save current data as designated workset. Each workset is
achieved by a unique ID generated by YeastWeb automatically or assigned by a user's own favorite name if users
requested. If a user's web browser supports cookies, previous saved workset can be also easily listed. It is noteworthy that, to avoid overwhelming burden of hard disk
space, all of user saved workset in YeastWeb are only
saved for 30 days. For the items listed in specific workset,
users can selectively download, add and remove the items
one by one or in bulk.
Detailed gene information includes: 1) Basic information, such as gene ID, function description, species
belonging to and cluster ID under different inflation values, sequence length, molecular weight, isoelectric point,
COG functional classification and associated KEGG
pathway; 2) Gene Ontology information, such as Gene
Ontology level, term definition and Gene Ontology ID; 3)
Domain organization information, such as domain
description from Pfam, SUPERFAMILY, SMART, TIGR-

of Refseq, Swiss-Prot, PDB, KEGG and UniProt (Top five
best hits are listed); 6) Sequence information, such as
nucleotide and protein sequence. Detailed gene family
information also includes: 1) Basic description, such as
cluster ID, cluster size, cluster description and MCL
inflation value; 2) Family member distribution, which
shows the number of genes from different yeast genomes;
3) Individual gene list with gene ID, sequence length and
function definition been shown.
Gene family analysis based on workset

Once a personalized workset have been configured, users
can apply the implemented comparative genomics and
molecular evolution tools to conduct a succession of
analyses to investigate the evolutionary relationship of
specific yeast gene family (Fig. 2). Multiple sequence
alignment can be easily performed using the "alignment"
function, which provides two widely adopted multiple
sequence alignment program MUSCLE [9] and ClustalW
[10] with a number of advanced parameters. Both protein
sequences and nucleotide sequences are allowed to be
used to perform the analysis. The visualization of webbased multiple sequence alignment results was implemented using the Jalview program [11], which provide a
batch of tools to handle the alignment results and display
the sequence features in color using the customized color
schemes. However, it should be noted that Jalview is a
Java applet program, thus, users have to confirm that a
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is installed on their
local machine before visualizing the alignment results.

Once a multiple sequence alignment job is finished, the
QuickTree program can be directly applied to construct a
phylogenetic tree using the neighbor-joining algorithm
[12]. The reliability of the tree can be evaluated with the
bootstrap method with replications (default value 100).
The constructed phylogenetic tree is shown in the user's
browser with the implement of ATV program [13].

Discussion and Conclusions
In comparison with SGD, CYGD and Génolevures, YeastWeb [14] allows all of the genes and gene families derived
from the yeast genomes to be accessed via a user-friendly
web interface. The web interface is well organized and
designed in the form of workset, which is very helpful for
users to save their intermediate results. For the data
stored in the workset, YeastWeb implemented a number
of comparative genomics and molecular evolution analysis tools to allow users to view the multiple sequence
alignment and phylogenetic tree of a given gene family.
Given the great interests in yeast research, YeastWeb will
be a valuable resource available for the scientific community of yeast biologists and related researchers to investigate the evolutionary relationship of yeast gene families.
Currently, YeastWeb contains clustered gene families
from 13 available yeast genomes and is expected to grow
with the rapid development of genome sequencing projects quickly. As more yeast genomes being fully
sequenced, YeastWeb will be expanded and updated
accordingly.
