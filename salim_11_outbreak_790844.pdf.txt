Abstract
Background: In this paper, we report an outbreak of bovine trypanosomiasis in Kurmuk District, Blue Nile State,
Sudan that involved an infection with four Trypanosoma species in cattle. The outbreak occurred in June 2010
when indigenous cattle, mainly Kenana and Fulani breed types, crossed the national Sudanese border to Ethiopia
and returned. A veterinarian was notified of massive deaths in the cattle populations that recently came from
Ethiopia. All animals involved in the outbreak were from the nomadic Fulani group and resident local cattle were
not infected and no death has been reported among them. A total of 210 blood samples were collected from the
ear vein of cattle. A few samples were also collected from other domestic animals species. Parasitological
examinations including hematocrit centrifugation techniques (HCT) and Giemsa-stained thin blood films were
carried out. ITS1-PCR, which provides a multi-species-specific diagnosis in a single PCR, was performed.
Findings: Parasitological examinations revealed that 43% (91/210) of the affected cattle population was infected
with two morphologically distinct trypanosomes. Seventy animals (33.3%) were infected with T. vivax and twenty
one (10%) with T. congolense. In contrast, ITS1-PCR was able to identify four Trypanosoma species namely T. vivax,
T. congolense, T. simiae and T. brucei in 56.7% (80/141). T. brucei showed the highest prevalence of 36.9% (52/141)
and the lowest 19% (27/141) was displayed by T. congolense. Furthermore, and because ITS1-PCR could not
differentiate between T. brucei subspecies, serum resistance-associated (SRA) gene based PCR was used to detect
the human T. brucei rhodesiense in T. brucei positive samples. None of the samples was shown positive for T. b.
rhodesiense. The identity of the 400 bp PCR product originating from T. simiae, was further confirmed by
sequencing and subsequent phylogenetic analysis.
Conclusions: The outbreak of bovine trypanosomiasis occurred in the Blue Nile State was caused by mixed infection of
two or more Trypanosoma species and the conventional parasitological examinations were not reliable in identifying all
the species of Trypanosoma involved in the outbreak. It is difficult to determine the cause of the disease for the reason
that the current enzootic situation in the resident cattle in the region is poorly understood. The study concluded that
there are at least four species of trypanosomes that caused this outbreak in the Blue Nile State. The presence of mixed
infections might have exacerbated the severity of the disease. It is hypothesized that variant parasite type(s) might have
been introduced to Sudanese cattle when they crossed to Ethiopia, a tsetse belt region.

Background
Cattle population in the Blue Nile State, Sudan, is estimated to be 1,995,024 heads (Annual Report of Ministry
of Animal Resources and Fisheries, Sudan, 2009). Generally, data on bovine trypanosomiasis and the vector

G. morsitans submorsitans in Kurmuk District [1].
This study has been carried out to determine the Trypanosoma species which were incriminated in an outbreak of bovine trypanosomiasis in Kurmuk District, the
Blue Nile State. It is evident that disease risk depends primarily on the density of the vector and trypanosome
infection rate. The affected animals were closer to Ethiopian tsetse-belt where nomads cross in with their

animals/cattle in search of pasture and water. The tsetse
flies in Ethiopia are confined to the southern and western
regions between longitude 33°and 38°E and latitude 5°and
12°N [2]. This region overlaps with the area where two
Glossina species were reported in the Blue Nile State,
Sudan [1], though there was no report showing the tsetse
belt is reaching the Blue Nile State in the Sudan.
Sample collection and parasitological examination

To preserve owners’ confidentiality and to adhere to the
International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research
involving animal subjects, no owner names were
recorded within any database or as part of the data collection process. The owners of the sampled cattle provided consent to have their animals included in the
study. Research on samples was conducted adhering to
guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University. The study protocol also followed the general guidelines for sampling domestic
animals provided by the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine,
University of Khartoum, Sudan.
The outbreak occurred in June 2010 (Rainy season).
On the 13th of June 2010, a total number of 210 blood
samples was collected from affected cattle in Sali village
at Kurmuk District (10°78’N 34°18’E) in the Blue Nile
State, Sudan (Figure 1). Three millilitres of blood were

collected from the ear vein in heparinized vacutainer
tubes (Becton Dickinson, France). A few more samples
were similarly collected from donkeys, camels and sheep
in the village (Table 1). Parasitological examinations
were carried out in the regional laboratory using HCT
according to [3]. Subsequently, 10% Giemsa-stained thin
blood smears were prepared and examined under oil
immersion field to identify trypanosomes species based
on their morphological structures. For PCR, 141 samples
were spotted onto FTA ® elute cards (Whatman, Inc,
UK), which included the 91 parasitologically positive
samples and additional 50 randomly selected negative
samples.
DNA extraction

Genomic DNA was extracted from six punches in each
FTA card to ensure correct estimation of prevalence as
described elsewhere [4-6]. Briefly, blood samples collected on FTA cards were dried thoroughly at room
temperature. Using a sterile punch, each FTA card was
punched out at 6 different positions each was 3 mm
size. These were placed into a sterile microcentrifuge
tube and rinsed 3 times each in 750 μL of deionized
water by vortexing for 5 seconds and discarding of
water. DNA was eluted using a buffer that contained 90
μL deionized water plus 10 μL 10X ThermoPol Reaction
Buffer (Biolabs, Inc, England). Elution was performed by
heating the sample at 95°C for 30 minutes using a heat
block. Eluted DNA concentration ranged between 100 250 ng/μL. DNA was stored at -20°C until used.
PCR

Extracted DNA was subjected to a PCR test, which
amplifies the ITS1 region of the rDNA gene of all African trypanosomes by using ITS1 CF/BR CF: 5’-CCG
GAAGTTCACCGATATTG-3’, BR: 5’-TGCTGCG
TTCTTCAACGAA-3’ [7]. The 700, 480, 400, and 250
bp of PCR products corresponding to T. congolense
(savannah), T. brucei subspecies and T. evansi, T. simiae
and T. vivax respectively, were amplified using GoTaq®
Colorless Master Mix, 2X (Promega Co., USA) in a 10
μl total volume. Each reaction included 5 μl GoTaq ®
Colorless Master Mix, 10 mM of each primer, 1 μl
RNase-free water and 2 μl (~100 ng/μl) extracted DNA.
To detect T. brucei rhodesiense, the following primer set
was used FP: 5’-ATA GTG ACA AGA TGC GTA CTC
AAC GC-3’ and RP: 5’-AAT GTG TTC GAG TAC
TTC GGT CAC GCT-3’. This primer set targets the
serum resistance-associated gene (SRA) and amplifies a
284-bp fragment [8]. Thermocycling profile started with
an initial hold for 2 min at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles
of 95°C for 30 sec, 58°C for 30 sec. and 72°C for 1 min.
A final extension step of 5 min at 72°C ended the program. PCR products were electrophoresed in 2% agarose

the affected population, as the majority of samples
selected for PCR were known parasitologically positive.
Nonetheless it is clearly reflected here that ITS1-PCR has
better specificity for detection of trypanosomes. The 400
bp fragments obtained from three randomly selected
T. simiae-positive samples were confirmed to be
T. simiae by direct sequencing of the ITS1 region. The T.
simiae detected in the in this study showed similarity to
T. simiae from Kenya (accession no. TSU22320). Phylogenetic relationship of the T. simiae identified in this
study to reference sequences of T. simiae, T congolense
and T. brucei is given in (Figure 3).
There are three known genetically distinct types of
T. congolense (savannah, forest and kilifi). Only the

Results and discussion
The results of HCT and Giemsa-stained blood films
revealed that 43% (91/210) of the cattle were infected
with two morphologically distinct trypanosomes. Seventy
(33.3%) were infected with T. vivax and twenty one
(10%) with T. congolense (Table 1). The ITS1 PCR identified four Trypanosoma spp (Table 2). The mortality
estimated for 4 herds (150 - 300 heads/herd) visited ranged between 20 - 90%.
The results obtained by ITS1-PCR indicated that cattle
were infected with four Trypanosoma spp. and most of
the infection patterns were of mixed nature. We could
detect simultaneous infection with 3 and even 4 Trypanosoma spp in a single animal (Figure 2). A total number of
80 cattle were infected, giving an overall prevalence of
56.7% (80/141) in these samples. T. b. brucei showed the
highest prevalence of 36.9% (52/141), followed by T.
simiae, 22% (31/141), T. vivax, 20% (28/141) and T. congolense, 19% (27/141) (Table 2). It is worth noting that

savannah type of T. congolense, (PCR fragment size of
700 bp) was detected, while the other two, T. congolense
kilifi (620 bp) and T. congolense forest (710 bp), were
not. T. congolense savannah is reported to be of extreme
virulence [9].
The conventional parasitological methods were not
able to detect and/or discriminate between T. simiae
and T. b. brucei though the latter had the highest prevalence when we used ITS1 PCR detection methods. The
low microscopic detection rate might be due to chronic
enzootic nature of T. b. brucei, in which the level of
parasitaemia is usually below the level of detection
offered by the conventional methods. On the other
hand, T. simiae might be misdiagnosed as T. congolense
as the two parasites are known to be morphologically
similar [10].

This study represents a first report on the presence of
T. simiae in Sudan. It is worth mentioning that large
numbers of wild boars (Sus scrofa) do exist in the Blue
Nile State. The presence of wild boars, which graze in
vicinity of domestic cattle in the region, could be linked
to the presence of T. simiae detected in cattle during
this study. It remains to be confirmed whether this animal could indeed act as a natural reservoir to this species of Trypanosoma.
Generic ITS1-PCR was developed by [11] for trypanosome detection. This method was modified to increase
the sensitivity of the primers to T. vivax, an important
cattle trypanosome [7,12]. In addition, [13,14] have
further refined the test to increase the sensitivity and
specificity in detecting trypanosomes. The method was
shown to be a powerful diagnostic technique for detecting and identifying trypanosomes quickly, accurately and
cheaply. In our study, ITS1-PCR detected lesser number
of positives (80) compared to the parasitological methods (91) in the same samples. Collected blood was kept
in the fridge before it was spotted in the FTA cards,
thus might become subjected to DNA degradation and
subsequently underestimated the accurate sensitivity of
the ITS1-PCR.
An additional species-specific PCR was sometimes
needed when the ITS1-PCR products of some species
were too similar or same in size to distinguish, for
example T. brucei subspecies and T. evansi or T. simiae
and T. simiae Tsavo [14]. Because ITS1-PCR could not
differentiate between T. brucei subspecies, we used the
serum resistance-associated (SRA) gene based PCR to
detect the human T. brucei rhodesiense in T. brucei

positive samples. However, none of the samples was
shown positive for this species.
From the result showed in Table 1, other domestic
livestock (donkeys, camels and sheep) were infected by
trypanosomes based on microscopical examination.
Although local resident cattle were not sampled during
this study, the presence of infection in other resident
animal species should imply that some if not all trypanosome species involved in this outbreak are also present in resident cattle in the region. Urgent screening of
possible trypanosome species in resident cattle in the
region using ITS1-PCR is required for understanding of
the enzootic nature of the disease.
The study concluded that there are at least four species of trypanosomes that caused an outbreak of trypanosomiasis in cattle in the Blue Nile State. The presence
of mixed infection might have exacerbated the severity
of the disease. Though we hypothesized that variant
parasite type(s) might have been introduced to Sudanese
cattle when they cross into Ethiopia, a tsetse belt region.
We conclude that future research should focus towards
a better understanding of the picture of parasite endemicity for better control measures. This plan should
also include surveillance for the possible Glossina and
other biting fly species existing in the region.
