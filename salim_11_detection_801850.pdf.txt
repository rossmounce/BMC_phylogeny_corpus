Detection of Fused Genes in Eukaryotic Genomes
using Gene deFuser: Analysis of the Tetrahymena
thermophila genome

Abstract
Background: Fused genes are important sources of data for studies of evolution and protein function. To date no
service has been made available online to aid in the large-scale identification of fused genes in sequenced
genomes. We have developed a program, Gene deFuser, that analyzes uploaded protein sequence files for
characteristics of gene fusion events and presents the results in a convenient web interface.
Results: To test the ability of this software to detect fusions on a genome-wide scale, we analyzed the 24,725
gene models predicted for the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila. Gene deFuser detected members of
eight of the nine families of gene fusions known or predicted in this species and identified nineteen new families
of fused genes, each containing between one and twelve members. In addition to these genuine fusions, Gene
deFuser also detected a particular type of gene misannotation, in which two independent genes were predicted as
a single transcript by gene annotation tools. Twenty-nine of the artifacts detected by Gene deFuser in the initial
annotation have been corrected in subsequent versions, with a total of 25 annotation artifacts (about 1/3 of the
total fusions identified) remaining in the most recent annotation.
Conclusions: The newly identified Tetrahymena fusions belong to classes of genes involved in processes such as
phospholipid synthesis, nuclear export, and surface antigen generation. These results highlight the potential of
Gene deFuser to reveal a large number of novel fused genes in evolutionarily isolated organisms. Gene deFuser
may also prove useful as an ancillary tool for detecting fusion artifacts during gene model annotation.

Background
Fusion genes, also known as chimeric genes, are formed
when the reading frames of two or more distinct genes
are joined together by recombination events such as
unequal crossing over, transposition, and deletion [1].
After the fusion, the new gene codes for a single, novel
protein that is a hybrid of the two separate proteins,
where each part performs a discrete function and has an
independent evolutionary history. Although very few of
these recombination events produce proteins that retain
their proper function or expression pattern, on occasion
the constituent genes do combine to form a new, working gene that can be passed on to offspring [2]. Generation of new multidomain proteins by gene fusions is a
major mechanism by which functional complexity has

evolved in multicellular eukaryotes [1,2], and many key
proteins currently under research, including Hedgehog
[3], Type II Topoisomerase, and RNA Polymerase [4],
began as fusions of genes in the ancestors of eukaryotes.
Successful fusion requires that both halves of the new
gene function properly despite the loss of expression
elements from the downstream gene, which falls under
control of the upstream promoter. Therefore, only
fusions in which the two linked proteins can function in
the same compartment of the cell, at the same developmental stage, and in response to the same stimuli will
be tolerated. While it has been hypothesized that two
genes with unrelated functions may merge and be
retained in the genome [4,5], almost all bifunctional
fusion genes seen to date show a functional relationship
between the proteins that comprise the fusion. Related
genes are more likely to result in a functional fusion
gene, and may even confer a selective advantage to the

organism in some cases. Most fused gene pairs have
orthologs that are part of the same metabolic pathway,
are involved in the same protein complex [6], or regulate one another’s activity [5]. A selective advantage may
emerge if the fused protein leads to a greater catalytic
activity or more efficient co-regulation than is possible
for the two independent proteins.
Given these complex requirements, gene fusions are
rarely successful, and few examples exist of analogous
recombinations occurring in multiple unrelated taxa by
convergent evolution [2,7]. These requirements also
guarantee that the split of a fusion gene into its two
component proteins is much rarer than the original
fusion events. Studies have estimated that gene fusion is
approximately four times more common than gene fission events, in which a single gene splits into multiple,
smaller coding segments [8]. The predominance of gene
fusions over gene fissions is expected in part because
gene fusions can result in the potentially favorable coupling of proteins with related biological functions, rather
than the unfavorable separation of proteins whose
shapes and functions have evolved together over time
[6]. Additionally, gene fusion involves the loss of the termini of the genes being fused, a much simpler process
than fission, which requires that the genes somehow
obtain a promoter, terminator, start codon, and stop
codon when the gene splits.
The scarce and persistent nature of gene fusions
makes them ideal macromolecular markers of evolution and, like insertions, deletions, and other genomic
rearrangements, they have long served as data for phylogenetic analysis. The usefulness of gene fusions in
studies of this type was featured in 2003 when, following the attempts of many different research groups to
locate the root of the eukaryote tree by a variety of
methods, the presence of a fusion between dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TS)
in plants and many protozoan species, but not in animals and fungi, supported rooting of the eukaryotic
tree between these groups [9,10]. Though gene losses
and horizontal gene transfer have complicated the conclusions that can be reached from these single-character analyses [11,12], gene fusions may still provide
some of the most reliable information about the deepest branching taxa.
In addition to their usefulness in phylogenetic studies,
gene fusions can also serve as Rosetta Stone proteins
that provide information about their constituent genes.
Since the fused proteins are likely to be functionally
related, characterization of each constituent gene
informs researchers about their homologs in other genomes [4,13]. In the majority of cases where annotation
of the function of fusion proteins in eukaryotes and prokaryotes is available, the constituent proteins are

Page 2 of 10

involved in core metabolism, which may help researchers understand both simple and more complex biological metabolic systems [13]. In particular, fusion proteins
in eukaryote genomes have been used to identify hidden
protein-protein interactions [13].
Despite their important uses in evolutionary studies as
powerful phylogenetic markers, and in functional studies
as windows into biochemical pathways and protein
interactions, few of the fusion genes present in eukaryotes have been identified and studied in depth.
Researchers have previously created programs to find
fusion genes in specific genomes [14,15]. However, to
date no large-scale service has been made available to
the public to aid in the identification of fusions in large,
genome-sized data sets. Here we present a new bioinformatics tool, Gene deFuser, which we have developed for
this purpose. The underlying algorithm compares
BLAST results from the beginning and end of protein
sequences submitted through an online interface. Putative gene fusions are displayed for the user in a convenient interface that simplifies further analysis of the
candidate genes. Gene deFuser is based on programs we
have used previously to identify gene fusions in the formaldehyde detoxification pathways of ciliates and diatoms [16] and in the methionine salvage pathway of
Tetrahymena [17]. To highlight the value of this service,
we present an in depth survey of the results obtained
for the predicted proteome of Tetrahymena thermophila, which includes the identification of several new
types of fusion genes.
During this survey we also identified a large number
of misannotated genes models, which can be attributed
to a common artifact of gene prediction software in
which two genes are merged into a single transcript.
Comparison of Gene deFuser results for the first and
final versions of the Tetrahymena genome showed that
about half of the artifacts found in the initial scan of the
genome were corrected over time. Gene deFuser may
serve as a useful tool to speed the identification of these
types of artifacts in future genome projects.

Methods
The Gene deFuser program utilizes BLAST [18] to
detect similarities between the two ends of a protein
and the sequences in a database of orthologous protein
groups. The program compares these sequences to the
KOG (eukaryotic orthologous groups) database [19],
which is a subset of the COG (clusters of orthologous
genes) database [20] containing groups of orthologous
genes for seven eukaryotic genomes. Although newer
and more complete ortholog databases exist, we chose
the KOG database because it was extensively curated
and the authors specifically broke down fused genes
into their component KOG domains [19,20]. This

Salim et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:279
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/279

allowed us to identify genes such as DHFR-TS (DTS1 in
Tetrahymena [16]; see Results) that would have otherwise been masked by their presence in one or more of
the species represented in the KOG database.
Gene deFuser generates a list of KOG identifiers for
each end of the protein in question based on the
BLAST results. The list of identifiers found for the Nterminus is then compared with those listed for the Cterminus. A typical non-fused protein will match the
same KOG at both the N-terminus and the C-terminus.
A protein that returns a matching KOG identifier at
both ends is presumed to be non-fused and is excluded
as a possible fusion gene. Proteins that do not share any
KOG hit at both ends are presented in a list of candidate fusion proteins. This method obviously omits
fusions that were missed during curation of the KOG
database. However, any fusion genes missed due to this
limitation are present in at least several of the model
organisms used to generate the KOG database and,
because these genomes are highly studied, these fusions
are likely to have been described already. The main
application of the Gene deFuser program is to identify
novel fusion genes.
An outline of the methodology used by Gene deFuser
to identify fused genes is shown in Figure 1. Gene deFuser accepts as input multiple protein sequences in
FASTA format and can be used to search files that
cover the size of a typical genome (~30,000 proteins).
After the user submits a set of proteins, the program
extracts a portion of the C-terminus and a portion of
the N-terminus of each sequence to use as queries in
BLAST searches. The fraction of the protein used for
BLAST searches of the C- and N-terminus can be
adjusted by the user, but the default is set at 30%. Using
too much of the protein as a query can lead to overlap
in the KOG hits on both ends and prevent the identification of fused genes; using too little of the protein can
result in poor BLAST scores. This parameter must be
set to less than 50% of the sequence to avoid overlap of
the segments, and after experimenting with different
values between 20% and 40%, we settled on using the
first 30% of the protein sequence as the N-terminus
query and the final 30% of the protein as the C-terminus query in our analysis of the Tetrahymena genome.
The default value of 30% brought back 52 sequences
that we believe are genuine fused genes. When we performed the search using 20%, the program only detected
19 of these 52 genes. When we increased to this parameter to 40%, the program appeared to detect a few
additional fused genes; however, it missed 7 of the 52
fusions detected using 30% and returned more false
positives. Based on these observations, the users are
encouraged to repeat their searches using different
values of this parameter.

After generating files containing the N- and C-termini
of the proteins, the sequences are used to search the
KOG database using BLASTP. We downloaded the
KOG database on July 10, 2010 and modified the dataset
by eliminating all protein sequences not assigned to a
KOG. About 54% (59,838) of the 110,655 gene products
analyzed to create the KOG database are included in

Salim et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:279
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/279

4,852 clusters of orthologs, while the remaining genes
are not assigned to an ortholog group. The BLAST
search results for the N- and C-termini that exceed a
user-defined threshold (default: e-value < 1e-10) are
parsed to determine the KOG of each hit, and then a
combined score for each KOG is calculated using the
methodology described in Zhou and Landweber [21].
Using this methodology, each KOG with a significant
hit is assigned a score given by the following formula:
N

SCOG =
i=1

−log(Pi )
N

where N is the number of sequences belonging to the
KOG group and Pi = 1-exp(Ei), where Ei is the e-value
of the blast hit to a given sequence. For sequences without significant blast hits, that is, with an e-value larger
than the e-value threshold, Pi = 1.
KOGs that score higher than a cutoff threshold set by
the user (default = 5) are used in the second part of the
analysis, which compares the KOGs that hit the N-terminus to those that hit the C-terminus of each protein.
If both ends are hit by at least one KOG, and the KOGs
that hit the N-terminus are different from those that hit
the C-terminus, the protein is deemed a candidate
fusion. We further divide the candidate fusion proteins
into two categories: those that have a single KOG hit to
each end and those that have multiple KOG hits to at
least one end.
The program identifies all candidate fusions in the file
and lists them on a web page. Each protein in this list is
hyperlinked to a page that details the KOG hits at both
the N-terminus and C-terminus and graphically displays
the location of BLAST hits against the Uniprot and
KOG databases. These results can then be examined by
an expert to determine whether each candidate is a
fused gene, a non-fused gene, or a sequencing or annotation error.
Because each submission can take several hours to run
after data are uploaded, the user is asked to submit an
email address to be notified when the job is completed.
When the program finishes its run, the job number is
emailed to the user for retrieval at the Gene deFuser
website. Gene deFuser is freely available online at:
http://DNA.pomona.edu/deFuser/deFuser.html.
To test this program and service, we uploaded and
analyzed the protein set predicted by The Institute for
Genomic Research (TIGR; now J. Craig Venter Institute)
for Tetrahymena thermophila strain SB210 [22]. The
current protein annotation (v.2008) [23] was downloaded from the TIGR website:

The initial protein annotation (v.2004) [22] was also
analyzed and the results were compared to the v.2008
sequences. The v.2004 sequences were downloaded
from the following location:

Results and discussion
To test Gene deFuser’s ability to detect fused genes, we
used it to analyze the genome of Tetrahymena thermophila, a ciliated protozoan evolutionarily distant from
the seven eukaryotic species used to populate the KOG
database. We chose Tetrahymena in particular because
of our familiarity with the biology of the organism, its
detailed genome annotation history, and our interest in
several of its previously described gene fusions [16,17].
In addition to the evolutionary gene fusions we expected
to find with this tool, we also attempted to identify artificial gene fusions created during the process of gene
model annotation, by comparing the earliest round of
gene predictions with the most recent round.
Gene deFuser detected 80 candidate fusion genes in
the final annotation (v.2008) of the Tetrahymena genome. The raw results of these analyses can be accessed
at http://dna.pomona.edu/deFuser/Results/Final_Tet/
Final_Tet.html and is available as Additional file 1. Brief
descriptions of the known fusions in this genome and
some of the more interesting new candidate fusions
detected by Gene deFuser are listed below. Prior to this
analysis we were aware of nine published families of
fusion genes either known or predicted to be present in
Tetrahymena (Table 1). Gene deFuser successfully identified members of eight of these families and also
revealed 19 additional families (52 new genes total) that
appear to be genuine fusions. These results have been
categorized and refined, and are presented in Table 1.
The remaining 28 candidates either have too little similarity to sequences in the KOG or Uniprot database for
us to make a valid judgment, or the architecture of the
gene model (e.g. a large intron between the putatively
fused domains) casts doubt on its legitimacy. It is
important to keep in mind that the classification of the
candidates into real fusion or false positives relies on
the interpretation of available data, and that these
fusions should be confirmed by experimental data if
they prove to be of interest to the researcher.
Known Tetrahymena Fusion Genes

FSF1 (Genbank: EAR92957) is a gene fusion that contains a formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) domain

the N-terminal domain resembles alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) Classes III and V (KOG0022 and KOG0023)
while the C-terminus resembles Esterase D (KOG3101).
Closer examination of these KOG hits and the list of
similar proteins in the UniProt database shows that the
two fused proteins function in the formaldehyde detoxification pathway. When naming the gene, we highlighted the common pathway in which these proteins
function by choosing synonyms for ADH III/V
(FALDH) and Esterase D (SFGH). Interestingly, this
gene seems to also be fused in a distantly related group
of protozoans, the diatoms, albeit in the reverse order,
with the SFGH protein in the N-terminus and the
FALDH protein in the C-terminus [16]. This feature
shows that the two original proteins fused independently
in the ciliate and diatom lineages.
MBD1 (Genbank: EAS04801) is a fusion of two genes
in the methionine salvage pathway, methylthioribulose1-phosphate dehydratase (mtnB) and 1,2-dihydroxy-3keto-5-methylthiopentene dioxygenase (mtnD) [17].
This fusion seems to be unique to Tetrahymena and its
closest relatives, as it is not present in the genome of
the other fully sequenced ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia.
Surprisingly, the Tetrahymena genome is lacking the
enzyme that catalyses the intermediate step in the
methionine salvage pathway between those of mtnB and
mtnD, enolase-phosphatase E1 (mtnC). Complementation tests in yeast mutants were used to show that the
fusion gene is able to catalyze the intermediate (mtnC)
step of the pathway in addition to the two expected

reactions, indicating a gain of function as a result of the
fusion [17].
DTS1 (Genbank: EAR85731) is a fusion of dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase, a well-known
fusion found in bikont organisms (plants, most protozoan species) but absent in unikonts (animals, fungi,
and amoebas) that was used to root the eukaryotic phylogenetic tree [9]. Even though this gene is fused in Arabidopsis thaliana, one of the organisms used to create
the KOG database, we were able to detect it thanks to
the manual curation of the KOG database that broke
down fused genes into their component domains.
The proteins PAC1 and PAC2 (Genbank: EAS02708
and EAS03660) each contain a P-type ATPase domain
and an adenylyl/guanylyl cyclase domain. A fusion
between these two genes was previously described in
another Tetrahymena species, T. pyriformis [24]. In
addition, the same fusion is was shown to be present in
the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia and in the apicomplexan Plasmodium falciparum, suggesting that it participates in a shared form of signal transduction in these
closely related species [24].
MFE1 (Genbank: EAS01180) is part of a welldescribed peroxisomal multifunctional enzyme family
with homologs in all types of unikonts, but with few
homologs among the bikonts. Only the alveolates show
homologs of these proteins, most likely indicating independent origins for these fusions rather than multiple
losses from many paraphyletic bikonts. Functional studies have been performed on the Toxoplasma gondii

These genes were removed in the final version of the annotation. Note that even though 29 false positives were identified, only 22 accession numbers are
listed. The remaining 7 false positives were eliminated before the sequences were submitted to GenBank, and thus have no accession number.

version of the protein that demonstrate its involvement
in cholesterol uptake [25].
Two copies of a serine-threonine protein phosphatase
with Kelch-like repeats (PPKLs), BSU1 (Genbank:
EAR82584) and BSU2 (Genbank: EAS02286), are homologs of a suppressor of brassinolide receptor kinase
mutations described in Arabidopsis [26]. Prior to the
sequencing of extensive protist and algal species, the
distribution of these genes was found to be limited to
plants and apicomplexans [27]. Results from Gene deFuser led us to identify BSU1 and BSU2, and further investigation led us to BSU3 (Genbank: EAR83784), another
homolog with a variant Kelch-domain that prevented its
identification by our program. Additional homologs
were identified during our subsequent BLAST searches
in other alveolates and in green algae.
CSY1 (Genbank: EAR98967) is a fusion between a
peptidyl prolyl isomerase (cyclophilin) and a homolog of
the yeast RNA splicing factor SYF2. This gene and its
ortholog in Paramecium have been identified previously
as members of a family of genes found only in alveolates, with the exception of the green algal species
Ostreococcus tauri [28]. The specific properties of this
fusion have not yet been explored, but its merit as a
drug target for alveolate parasites has been noted. TBS1
(Genbank: EDK31800) is a small GTPase of the SEC7
family fused to a TBC1-related GTPase activating protein. Like the cyclophilin/SYF2 genes, fusions of these
two secretory pathway proteins are believed to comprise
a family unique to alveolates [29].
While Gene deFuser was able to identify the eight
types of fusion genes listed above, it did miss two genes
that we expected it to find, TBS2 (Genbank: EAR85277)
and CYC13 (Genbank: EAR91121). TBS2 is a paralog of
the TBS1 gene described above. Although the program
did not detect TBS2, it did return one fusion belonging
to this family. The only unique gene fusion that we
expected to find but was missed by the program was
CYC13. The CYC13 fusion links a cyclin protein to a
cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and was first observed
in a screen of cell cycle-specific genes in the ciliate
Eufolliculina uhligi [30]. BLAST searches of both TBS2
and CYC13 show no similarity to known sequences for
large portions of the N-terminus of each gene (32% of
the TBS2 sequence and 35% of the CYC13 fusion). It is
not clear whether these N-terminal sequences are
indeed part of the actual proteins, but these extra
sequences with no homology explain why neither protein was identified by our program. Increasing the
amount of the protein sequence used to BLAST the
KOG database from its default value of 30% to 45% did
not help in identifying these sequences. In the case of
these proteins, a sliding window approach would likely
overcome this limitation in the software, as the different

KOGs that hit these sequences do not overlap. Such a
methodology might be implemented in a future version
of the program.
New Tetrahymena Fusion Genes

One of the most useful applications of Gene deFuser,
and the detection of fused genes in general, is to allow
the generation of hypotheses that later can be tested
experimentally. For example, the fusion MBD1 described
in the previous section was first detected during the
testing of an early version of this program. Based on the
lack of mtnC in the Tetrahymena genome, we hypothesized that this fusion of mtnB and mtnD also catalyzes
the mtnC reaction. We then successfully showed this to
be the case using yeast deletion strains [17]. In addition
to previously described fused genes such as this, Table 1
lists several as yet uncharacterized fusions among the 80
candidate fusions detected by the program. Here we
describe some of the more interesting fusions found in
this list.
The first is a fusion between a long-chain fatty acylCoA reductase and dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase (DHPAT) (Genbank: EAS00429) that we
have called ART1. These two enzymes catalyze sequential steps in the production of membrane phospholipids.
Fusions of these genes are distributed in an odd pattern
among several eukaryotic groups, suggesting either multiple evolutionary gains or losses of this fusion. The
fusion is present in the ciliates T. thermophila (Genbank: EAS00429) and P. tetraurelia (Genbank:
XP_001433255), but not in other alveolates whose genomes have been fully sequenced, such as the dinoflagellate Perkinsus marinus or the apicomplexans
Plasmodium, Toxoplasma, Babesia or Cryptosporidium.
The fusion is also present in the amoebozoans Dictyostelium discoideum (Genbank: XP_636393) and Polysphondylium pallidum (Genbank: EFA75040). Fusions of
these genes are also found in one stramenopile, Phytophthora infestans (Genbank: XP_002902570), but not
in other stramenopiles like Thalassiosira pseudonana or
Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Likewise, a fusion is present in the excavate Naegleria gruberi (Genbank:
XP_002683520), but not in other excavates like Giardia
intestinalis or Trichomonas vaginalis.
Many of the remaining gene fusions detected in Tetrahymena appear to belong to expanded gene families.
With twelve copies present in the genome, the most
common fusion detected was a protein formed by joining leishmanolysin and a subtilisin-like proprotein convertase (Genbank: EAR96678, EAR96679, EAR96681,
EAR82776, EAR86010, EAR86011, EAR86012,
EAR86013, EAR86016, EAR86017, EAR86018,
EDK32083), both of which are peptidases [31] that localize to the cell surface [32]. It has been noted that

Salim et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:279
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/279

leishmanolysins constitute a greatly expanded protein
family in Tetrahymena [22], suggesting that protein processing at the cell surface may be particularly complex
in ciliates. It is possible that the fusions identified here
might simplify these types of reactions at the cell surface. Additionally, in mice, the genes that code for both
these proteins are regulated by the protein Nrf2 and are
co-regulated by the anti-tumor compound curcumin
[31]. These connections further suggest that these proteins contribute to a common process and that the
fusion may have some significance in Tetrahymena.
Also present are four copies of a serine/threonine
kinase fused with O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (Genbank: EAR98929, EAS07587, EAR94286,
EAS05661). Serine/threonine kinases phosphorylate proteins on the hydroxyl group of specific serine or threonine residues [33], while O-linked N-acetylglucosamine
transferases instead attach a single b-O-linked N-acetylglucosamine to serine and threonine residues [34]. Since
these enzymes could compete for the same phosphorylation/glycosylation sites, a fusion of the two catalytic
domains might provide a simple way to regulate this
competition.
Several of the fusions present in Tetrahymena involve
the motor proteins myosin and kinesin. A fusion of
kinesin with an ER-golgi vesicle tethering protein (Genbank: EAR95984, EAR91273) might participate in anterograde vesicle movement from the ER to the Golgi,
which is known to be mediated directly by kinesin [35].
Three fusions (Genbank: EAR87392, EAR93163,
EAR98568) are found between myosin and RCC1, a
nuclear Ran-GEF that promotes transport of cargo
across the nuclear membrane [36]. Myosins have been
found in the nucleus, and some types have been shown
to localize specifically at the nuclear pore complex [37].
Thus, it is possible that the myosin-RCC1 fusions identified are involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport. Two
kinesin-RCC1 fusions (Genbank: EAR84240, EAR88562),
on the other hand, might serve a different function.
While the KOG hits in the Gene deFuser results do not
specify the type of kinesin involved in the fusion, the
results of the BLAST search against Uniprot show the
best match is to part of Centromere Protein E (CENPE), a kinetochore-associated kinesin. CENP-E has been
implicated as a sensor that mediates the capture of
microtubules at the kinetochore and relays this to the
checkpoint machinery [38]. During mitosis RCC1 is
responsible for the production of Ran-GTP, which is
known to stimulate the release of checkpoint proteins
from the kinetochores [38], thus overcoming the cell
cycle checkpoint at the end of mitosis. The fusion of
these proteins might provide a streamlined mechanism
for cell cycle regulation during micronuclear mitosis, or
may be involved somehow in the poorly understood

separation of acentromeric chromosomes during
amitosis.
Detection of Annotation Artifacts

Of the 80 Tetrahymena genes identified by Gene deFuser, we believe that 52 are likely to represent actual
fusions (Table 1). The majority of the remaining 28
(Table 2) are most likely artifacts created by faulty start/
stop codon identification during gene model annotation.
When viewing these genes in the genome browser at
the Tetrahymena Genome Database [39], most show
that the two domains are separated by an abnormally
long non-coding region, which we believe represents
intergenic regions miscalled as introns.
Earlier versions of the Tetrahymena genome are available from the TIGR (now J. Craig Venter Institute) website, and Gene deFuser analyses of these proteins return
different results. The initial annotation (v.2004), contained 105 candidate gene fusions, compared with the
80 found in the current annotation (v.2008). Most of
these genes (76) were present in both versions and were
identified by Gene deFuser. Twenty-nine spurious
fusions resulting from annotation artifacts were separated or eliminated from the annotation over the intervening period, whereas 4 new putative fusions
(Genbank: EAS02650, EAS02286, EDK31800,
EDK32083) were introduced into the annotation.
We believe that 25 of the 28 false positive gene
fusions detected by Gene deFuser represent genes that
have not yet been separated by annotators. Twenty-four
of these 25 genes have an intron larger than 413 bp
located between the two domains that comprise the
putative fusion. The median intron length in Tetrahymena is 86 bp and only 8.3% of the introns in this species are larger than 400 bp (data not shown). That such
large introns are located between the two domains suggests these introns were miscalled, resulting in the
fusion of adjacent gene models. The presence of paired
EST reads matching only the 3’end of the other gene
(EAR99401) indicates that it too is an annotation artifact. One of the three remaining candidate fusions is a
non-fused Ca2+/calmodulin dependent kinase gene present in many organisms, which Gene deFuser misclassified as a candidate fusion based on hits to several
different kinase families (EAR82879). We judged the
two remaining candidates to be false positives based on
low BLAST scores (EAR96106 and EAR89363). Though
these appear at first glance to be false positives, additional data may prove several of these 28 genes to be
genuine fusions.
The detection of these annotation artifacts highlights
another possible use for Gene deFuser, as a tool to aid
in the refinement of gene models during genome
sequencing projects. Since a large portion (51%; 54/105)

Salim et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:279
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/279

of the genes detected by the program in the preliminary
annotation were gene model fusion artifacts, this tool
could be used following the initial annotation of new
genomes to identify some of the more obvious fusion
artifacts. Gene deFuser can generate a list of putative
fusions for annotators to evaluate using their own criteria, which are likely to differ based on the quality of
the initial annotation and the uniformity found in the
lengths of introns and intergenic regions.

Conclusions
Fused genes are a large untapped source of data for studies of molecular evolution and protein function. The
new program described in this paper promises to speed
the identification of fusions in a wide variety of organisms, with the most interesting results likely to come
from more evolutionarily diverse species. Our application of Gene deFuser to the Tetrahymena genome illustrates the large number of new fusion genes waiting to
be found in more exotic eukaryotic genomes. In this
study alone we have identified new fusions involving a
wide variety of proteins, including nucleases, proteases,
motor proteins, and kinases. It is reasonable to expect
an equally interesting collection of fusion genes in the
genomes of other divergent eukaryotes.
