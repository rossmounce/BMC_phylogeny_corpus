Abstract
Background: CD14 is an important player in host innate immunity in that it confers
lipopolysaccharide sensitivity to cell types like neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages. The study
was aimed at characterizing the CD14 gene of cattle for sequence variations and to determine the
effect of variations on the expression of the protein on the surfaces of monocytes and neutrophils
in healthy dairy cows.
Results: Five SNPs were identified: two within the coding regions (g.A1908G and g.A2318G,
numbering is according to GenBank No. EU148609), one in the 5' (g.C1291T) and two in the 3'
(g.A2601G and g.G2621T) untranslated regions. SNP 1908 changes amino acid 175 of the protein
(p.Asn175Asp, numbering is according to GenBank No. ABV68569), while SNP 2318 involves a
synonymous codon change. Coding region SNPs characterized three gene alleles A (GenBank No.
EU148609), A1 (GenBank No. EU148610) and B (GenBank No. EU148611) and two deduced
protein variants A (ABV68569 and ABV68570) and B (ABV68571). Protein variant A is more
common in the breeds analyzed. All SNPs gave rise to 3 haplotypes for the breeds. SNP genotype
1908AG was significantly (P < 0.01) associated with a higher percentage of neutrophils expressing
more CD14 molecules on their surfaces. The promoter region contains several transcription factor
binding sites, including multiple AP-1 and SP1 sites and there is a high conservation of amino acid
residues between the proteins of closely related species.
Conclusion: The study has provided information on sequence variations within the CD14 gene
and proteins of cattle. The SNP responsible for an amino acid exchange may play an important role
in the expression of CD14 on the surfaces of neutrophils. Further observations involving a larger
sample size are required to validate our findings. Our SNP and association analyses have provided
baseline information that may be used at defining the role of CD14 in mediating bacterial infections.
The computational analysis on the promoter and comparative analysis with other species has
revealed regions of regulatory element motifs that may indicate important regulatory effects on the
gene.

Background
The bovine cluster of differentiation (CD) 14 is an important player in host innate immunity in that it mediates
host defense against Gram-negative bacterial infections
and also confers immunity against viral infections [1,2]. It
is abundant (about 99,500 to 134,600) on the cell membrane of monocytes and to a lesser extent (about 1,900 to
4,400) on neutrophils (polymorphonuclear neutrophil
leukocytes) [3,4]. Two forms exist, a membrane bound
form (mCD14) and a soluble (sCD14) form [5]. sCD14 is
known to confer lipopolysaccharide (LPS) sensitivity to
cells lacking mCD14, including epithelial cells and
endothelial cells [6,7]. Also, recombinant bovine sCD14
can sensitize mammary epithelial cells to low concentrations of LPS in vivo and in vitro thus indicating an important role of sCD14 in initiating host responses to Gramnegative bacterial infections [8,9]. During the periparturient period, individual variations have been noticed in the
response of cows to Gram-negative and Gram-positive
bacteria infections [10]. Therefore, sequence variations of
the CD14 gene may play important roles in the presentation of CD14 molecules and thus, LPS sensitivity.
The CD14 gene of cattle was initially cloned and
sequenced by Ikeda et al. [11] and recently by the bovine
genome project. It is mapped to BTA 7. A SNP of human
CD14 promoter has been shown to influence the activities
of the gene [12]. Baldini et al. [13] reported a SNP in the
human CD14 gene promoter involving a C to T transition
at position -159 (or -260 by [14]), and associated TT
homozygotes with significantly higher levels of sCD14
and lower levels of IgE in children as compared to carriers
of TC or CC. Reports of association of the -159 CD14 polymorphism with several human disease conditions have
emerged [15-17]. Other authors however did not find any
association between this polymorphism and several diseases [18,19]. Despite the importance of this protein and
the effect of the promoter polymorphism in humans,
there is no report of sequence variations of this gene in
cattle and their possible effects on circulating CD14 levels
and disease susceptibility.
The objectives of this study were therefore to: (1) investigate the CD14 gene of cattle for sequence variations; (2)
determine the effect of variations on CD14 expression on
the surfaces of monocytes and neutrophils; and (3) use
bioinformatics tools to computationally characterize the
promoter region. In this study we present information on
sequence variations within the CD14 gene of Canadian
Holstein and Jersey cows and a possible role of one SNP
in influencing the surface expression of the antigen on the
surfaces of neutrophils. Furthermore, identified conserved
regions of regulatory element motifs may have important
regulatory effects on the gene. The results may provide
baseline information that may be used in candidate gene

studies aimed at defining the role of CD14 in mediating
bacterial infections.

Results
SNPs in the CD14 gene of Canadian Holsteins and Jersey
cows
Comparison of the CD14 sequences of 106 Canadian
Holsteins and 46 Jersey cows with published sequences
(GenBank Nos. NW_001495367 and D84509) revealed a
total of five SNPs including one in the 5' untranslated
region (UTR) (g.C1291T, numbering is according to GenBank No. EU148609), two in the coding regions
(g.A1908G and g.A2318G) and two in the 3' UTR
(g.A2601G and g.G2621T) (Table 1). Four of the SNPs are
transitional mutations while SNP 2621 involves the transversion of guanine to thymine. SNP 1908 is responsible
for a non-synonymous codon change in amino acid 175
of the protein, from Asn (aac) to Asp (gac), while SNP
2318 results in a synonymous codon change without a
change in amino acid 311 (Pro, cca vs ccg) of the protein.
The coding region SNPs characterizes three gene alleles A
(A1908A2318) (GenBank No. EU148609), A1 (A1908G2318)
(GenBank No. EU148610) and B (G1908G2318) (GenBank
No. EU148611) and two deduced protein variants A
(Asn175) (A1908A2318, GenBank No. ABV68569 or
A1908G2318, GenBank No. ABV68570) and B (Asp175)
(G1908G2318, GenBank No. ABV68571). Protein variant A
is more common in the breeds analyzed with a frequency
of 88.6% in Holsteins and fixed in Jerseys (Table 1).
Within protein variant A, gene allele A1 occurred at a very
high frequency (80.2%) in Jerseys. The non-coding SNPs
occurred at about equal magnitudes in Holsteins while
the frequencies of T1291, G2601 and T2621 were above 80%
in Jerseys.

Comparison of deduced protein sequences with reported
CD14 protein sequences for cattle (UniProt AAD32215
and UniProt NP_776433) revealed a further amino acid
difference, 209Ser→Thr. Further comparisons revealed
that amino acid 175Asn is conserved in cattle, buffalo
(UniProtKB ABE68724), goat (UniProtKB ABE68725)
and sheep (UniProtKB NP_001070677) while Asp is
present at this position in cattle variant B.
Haplotye structure of the breeds
Considering the five SNPs identified and the genotype
information of all individuals sequenced, the program
PHASE V2.2.1 determined a total of four potential haplotype combinations (CAAAG-C1291A1908A2318A2601G2621,
CGAAG, TGGGT, TAGGT) in the analyzed breeds. TGGGT
was absent in Jersey while CGAAG was absent in both
populations. The gene alleles A1 and B were observed
from the sequencing data to be associated with SNPs
T1291, G2601 and T2621 while allele A was associated with
C1291, A2601 and G2621 therefore giving rise to three actual

Effects of CD14 genotypes on the expression of CD14 on
the surfaces of monocytes and neutrophils
Whole blood from healthy Holstein cows (animals showing no outward symptoms of infection and farm record
indicating milk somatic cell counts below 200,000 cells/
ml) with different CD14 genotypes were incubated with
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled mouse antihuman CD14 antibody to determine the effects of genotypes on the expression of CD14 antigens on the surfaces
of monocytes and neutrophils. The results are presented
in Figure 1 and Table 2. In Figure 1, a higher percentage of
gated monocyte cells were found in the LogFITC region
labeled M2 (log102 and above) which indicates a higher
fluorescence intensity coming from cells with the most
CD14 antigens on their surfaces and termed the high
expression region. On the other hand, more neutrophils
were in the M1 or low expression region (Log101 to 102).
The mean channel fluorescence (MCF) intensities (for all
cows) observed for the gated regions were M1 = 32.04
(range 16.67 – 65.18), M2 = 288.97 (149.85 – 566.47)
and M3 = 201.44 (73.57 – 437.56) for monocytes and M1
= 22.76 (16.20 – 35.52), M2 = 267.33 (148.26 – 536.87)
and M3 = 34.76 (19.49–60.83) for neutrophils. As presented, the M3 (M1 + M2) MCF intensity for monocyte
was higher than for neutrophils. SNP A1908G that
changes amino acid 175Asn to Asp, and thus protein A to
B, is significantly (P < 0.01) associated with a higher
number of neutrophils in the M2 or higher expression
zone. 7.26% of gated neutrophils from cows of genotype
1908AG were found in M2 as compared to 4.36% from
cows of genotype 1908AA (Table 2). In the M1 zone, the
percentage of neutrophils from cows of both genotypes
was the same. For monocytes, a higher number of total

to means. A similar result was recorded for haplotypes.
Characterization of CD14 promoter and comparative
analysis ofCD14 proteins
The CD14 sequence analyzed in this study is made up of
2630 bps with a 1213 bp promoter (Figure 2), two exons
and one intron (GenBank No. EU148609). With the use
of bioinformatics tools and published information in the

literature, we were able to identify putative transcription
factor binding sites (TFBSs) (with 100% match against
searched data bases) on the bovine CD14 promoter. The
putative TFBSs described here are, in particular, those
already demonstrated to control the expression of the
gene in human and rat. The putative motifs are shown in
Figure 2 (boxed) and include amongst others 9 PU.1, 7AP1, 5 SP1, 4 C/EBP, 3 c-Myb and 2 AP-2 sites.
We also searched for conserved regulatory motifs in the
core promoters of the CD14 genes of different species
(cattle, human, mouse, rat and pig) through a query in the

ms&sub group=promoter. The results indicated a total of
63 motifs of 50 regulatory elements (REs) that were conserved in the analyzed breeds with zero to 3 bp mismatches (Figure 3). Nine of the motifs representing 6 REs
including C/EBP and Spi-1/PU.1 were conserved in all the
species while 4 motifs of 3 REs including AP1 and C/EBPalpha were conserved in 4 species including cattle (Figure
3). Furthermore, 60.30% (38) of the motifs were conserved between cattle and at least two other species.
Sequence alignment of the same region revealed a perfect
conservation, both in nucleotide number and orientation
of the TATA box in cattle, human, mouse and rat (data not
shown). The TATA box of pig differed from the others by
only one bp mismatch.
Further, we checked the degree of conservation between
the CD14 proteins of cattle with those of different species.

Protein sequences compared were those deduced in this
work, variants A (ABV68569) and B (ABV68571), other
published bovine sequences UniProt: BAA21517,
AAD32215 and NP_776433, protein sequences of buffalo
(ABE68724), goat (ABE68725), sheep (NP_001070677),
pig (AAY98033), mouse (CAA32166), rat (NP_068512)
and human variant 1 (NP_001035110) and 2
(NP_000582). The analysis revealed extensive conservations in the amino acid composition and structure. For the
bovine proteins, the sequence of ABV68569 is the same as
BAA21517 while AAD32215 and NP_776433 differed
from ABV68569 by having amino acid 209 changed from
Ser to Thr. This indicates the presence of a further CD14
protein variant in cattle here named C. Furthermore, the
amino acids of the CD14 proteins of buffalo, sheep and
goat shared high conservation rates of 97.05%, 95.17%,
and 87.40% respectively, with the bovine ABV68569, followed by pig (76.94%) (Figure 4). The rate of amino acid
conservation of bovine A variant was less with the human

While bovine, buffalo, goat, sheep and pig proteins are
made up of 373 amino acids, the human protein has two
more, and the rat and mouse have one more and seven
less animo acids, respectively. The signal peptide, made
up of the first 20 amino acids, was highly conserved (only
one amino acid difference, 14Ser to Pro) between the
bovine and buffalo/goat/sheep proteins. The difference
between cattle and the pig was 4 amino acids while being
highly diverged with human, mouse and rat (7 to 12
amino acid differences). These relationships were further
represented phylogenetically (Figure 4). As depicted in
Figure 4, three main groups were evident; the rat and
mouse proteins in group one (bootstrap value 100), the
human proteins in another group (bootstrap value 100)
while members of the Artiodactyla order (bovine, buffalo,
goat, sheep) and pig formed a group of their own (bootstrap value 99). In the third group, the pig formed an outcrop of its own, while a closer relationship was visible
between cattle and buffalo on the one hand (bootstrap
value 72) and, goat and sheep on the other hand (bootstrap value 78).

Discussion
We report here sequence variations of the bovine CD14
gene of Canadian Holstein and Jersey cows, through
genomic DNA sequencing and computational analysis of
the promoter. A gene is made up of both coding and noncoding regions which are all important in its expression
and functionality. The complete description of a gene
must therefore contain necessary information about the
protein coding regions [20] and non-coding regions. The
CD14 gene is an important component in host immunity

[1,8] and detailed information on its structure and
sequence variations as shown in this study may provide
further insight into its mode of action.
The coding region SNPs in our study and comparative
analysis of our sequences with published sequences show
that the CD14 gene of cattle codes for three putative CD14
proteins-A (GenBank No. ABV68569 and ABV68570), B
(GenBank No. ABV68571) and C (UniProt AAD32215
and UniProt NP_776433), with A and B described herein.
The A variant, fixed in Jerseys and with a high frequency
of 88.6% in Holsteins, may be the original wild type allele
for the gene. Furthermore, the sequence of UniProt
BAA21517 is similar to variant A and the haplotyes that
contain the A variant SNPs are at the highest frequencies
in the studied breeds. The other variants may therefore be
the result of recent mutational events. Further three SNPs
described in the 5' and 3'UTRs and one synonymous SNP
in the coding region of the gene indicates a higher
sequence variation for the gene in Canadian Holsteins
than Jerseys.
The variations, both in the coding and non-coding regions
of the gene may affect the surface expression of CD14
molecules on monocytes and neutrophils. Interestingly,
the coding region SNP that gave rise to the B variant of the
protein (g.A1908G or p.Asn175Asp) had the greatest
effect by being associated with the highest number of neutrophils expressing more CD14 molecules on their surfaces. It is well known that, monocytes express more
CD14 receptors on their surfaces, about 99,500 to
134,600 as compared to 1,900 to 4,400 for neutrophils
(3). This difference was clearly shown by the pattern of

expression depicted in Figure 1 whereby, more monocytes
were recorded in the M2 gated zone (region of higher
expression) and more neutrophils in the M1 zone (lower
expression). These results suggest that, the characteristic B
protein SNP or g.A1908G may play a role in cell surface
expression of CD14 on neutrophils. Also, the SNP in the
5'UTR region could be important in influencing the
expression of this receptor on monocytes. Our data was
however based on a small sample size necessitating further verifications on a larger scale. Neutrophils form a
major line of defense against bacterial infections and their
effectiveness depends on their availability at the site of
infections. For Gram-negative bacterial infections, the
CD14 molecule confers LPS sensitivity to neutrophils [4],
which is necessary to initiate host immune responses. The
complex of TLR4, CD14 and myeloid differentiation protein 2, enhanced by the presence of LPS binding protein is
crucial in LPS signaling; leading to the release of cytokines
[21-23].

Even though no promoter polymorphism was detected in
this study, a promoter polymorphism of the gene in
human is a risk factor in several diseases [15-17]. The promoter region in bovine may probably be under strong
purifying selection which may explain the lack of SNPs in
this region. This is a positive factor considering the important role of the gene in mediating Gram-negative bacteria
attack and the possible effect of the 1908 SNP on the
abundance of the molecule on the surfaces of neutrophils.
Determination of the roles of the individual SNPs and
haplotypes on the activities of the gene under disease conditions will further shed more light on their biological significance.
Our analysis on promoter characterization indicates that
part of the exon 1 reported by Ikeda et al. [11] constitutes
the promoter. Since evolutionary pressures lead to the
conservation of important non-protein-coding regulatory
regions, including transcription factor binding sites

(TFBs) across closely related species, identification of TFBs
described in the CD14 genes of human [24] and rat [25]
in the present study was expected. In particular, the perfect
conservation of the TATA box, 9 motifs of 6 REs motifs
across cattle, human, rat, mouse and pig and 4 other
motifs across at least 4 of these species including cattle
shows common regions in the core promoter that act
together in the same biological context to control the
expression of gene products and functions. In our study,
up to 5 SP1 and 8 AP1 sites (with no bp mismatch) were
identified which may indicate possible roles in controlling the expression of the gene as demonstrated in the rat
and humans [24,25]. In the rat, Lui et al. [25] through
mobility shift assays demonstrated that the SP1 and AP1
elements located respectively at positions -836 and -270
were required for basal promoter activity in liver cells.
Also, Zhang et al. [24] showed that the SP1 transcription
factor bound to three different regions of the human
CD14 promoter and that a mutation of the major SP1
binding site decreased tissue specific promoter activity.
One of the AP1 sites in our study, also shared by c-Fos and
c-Jun (position 960–967, Figure 2), is similar to an AP1
site in rat promoter were JunD and Fra-2 proteins have
been shown to bind [25]. This site is also thought to transactivate the basal expression of the gene [25]. This site in
the mouse also plays a major role in the expression of the
CD14 gene in macrophages [26]. Furthermore, three
motifs of PEA3 interestingly were conserved in the promoters of all species studied. PEA3 belongs to the ETS
transcription factor super family and is known to appear
on the promoters of many cellular genes, including HER2/neu [27] and CD226 antigen [28]. Conservation of C/
EBP or CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins motifs in the
studied species may be explained by their involvement in
many aspects of cell growth. The high conservation of the
amino acids of the proteins of bovine, buffalo, sheep and
goat proteins was reflected in the tree of their phylogenetic
relationships and is in line with other studies that found
a high rate of conservation of genes and protein coding
nucleotide positions between bovine, sheep and goat
genes [29,30]. This further supports the fact that information from the sequencing of the bovine genome will
greatly enhance studies in other very closely related species.

Conclusion
Overall, this study provides information on sequence variations of the CD14 gene of Canadian Holstein and Jersey
cows. The identified variations and association data have
provided information that may shade more light on cell
surface expression of CD14 by neutrophils, which are
needed to control bacterial infections. Further data on the
biological significance of the mutations is however necessary. Our computational analysis highlighted on the regu-

latory element motifs present in the promoter region of
the gene. The comparative analysis with other species
revealed conserved regions of regulatory element motifs
that may have important regulatory effects on the gene.

Methods
Animals and genomic DNA extraction
Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood of 106 Canadian Holstein cows kept at the Howard Webster CentreMacdonald Teaching Farm, McGill University and the
milks of 46 Jersey cows enrolled in the Quebec Dairy Production Centre of Expertise program http://www.val
acta.com using Nucleospin Blood Mini Kit (MachereyNagel Inc. Easton, PA) as described by the manufacturer.
In the case of milk DNA isolation, the manufacturer's protocol was slightly modified. Milk samples were initially
centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C to remove
excess fat before proceeding with the manufacturer's protocol.
PCR amplification and sequencing
Four primer pairs were designed with Invitrogen's OligoPerfect™ software (Invitrogen, Canada Inc., Burlington,
ON, Canada) based on GenBank No. NW_001495367
and used to amplify overlapping regions covering the
whole Bos taurus CD14 gene (Table 3). Invitrogen synthesized the primers.

PCR reactions with all primer pairs were each carried out
in a total volume of 45 μL containing 50 ng DNA, 0.25
mM dNTPs, 2.0 to 2.5 mM MgCl2 (Table 3), 10 μM of each
primer, 2 units Tag DNA polymerase (Fermentas Life Sciences, Burlington, ON, Canada) and 1× Taq buffer. The
cycling conditions, with PTC-100™ thermal cycler (MJ
Research, Inc., Watertown, MA, USA) included an initial
denaturation for 2 min at 94°C followed by 30 cycles
comprising 30 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at 60°C, 50 sec at 72°C,
and a final elongation for 5 min at 72°C. Both directions
of amplified PCR products were sequenced by McGill
University/Genome Quebec Innovation Centre using the
big dye termination technique and an ABI 3700
sequencer.
Sequence analysis
Sequences were processed with Chromas, version 1.45
http://www.technelysium.com.au/chromas14x.html)
and comparison with other published sequences was
done with the multiple sequence alignment program with
hierarchical clustering, Multalign http://bioinfo.genop
ole-toulouse.prd.fr/multalin/multalin.html. CD14 protein sequences of different species (cattle, buffalo, goat,
sheep, pig, man, mouse and rat) were aligned or processed
with MEGA3.1 software [31] and phylogenetic relationships also constructed with the same software.

Computational characterization of the bovine CD14
promoter
The promoter region was analyzed for the presence of
putative transcription factor-binding sites using the combined search query against the TRANSFAC database with
a maximum allowable string mismatch of 10% [[32];
http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/tess/tess]. The combined search query option was used to take advantage of
the full power of combined string and weight matrix
searching, pre-filtering of factors, significance p-values,
and new information in new databases. Particular attention was paid to binding sites already proven to be of significance in regulating the CD14 gene of other species and
other common binding sites in mouse and human.
Identification of conserved motifs of regulatory elements
in the non-coding regions of the CD14 gene of cattle and
other species
Since regions of conserved non-coding sequences
between closely related or divergent species are likely to
have common functional roles, we searched the region,
about 500 bps of the core promoters of cattle (this study
or GenBank No. EU148609), human (GenBank No.
U00699), mouse (GenBank No. X13987), rat (GenBank
No. AF087944) and pig (GenBank No. DQ079063) for
described conserved regulatory element (RE) motifs
against the NSITEM data base http://linux1.soft
berry.coberry.phtml?topic=nsitem&group=proams&sub
oup=promoter. These species were chosen because of the
availability of complete or partial promoter sequence
information.
Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry was used to study the effects of identified
CD14 SNPs on the expression of CD14 on the surfaces of
neutrophils and monocytes in healthy cows. Blood was
collected from the caudal vein of 64 Holstein cows with
known CD14 genotypes by venipuncture into vacutainer
tubes coated with heparin anticoagulant (BD Biosciences,

Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). After collection, samples were
stored on ice and analyzed within four hours. One hundred microlitre of heparinized whole blood was placed in
a 12 × 75 mm flow cytometric (FCM) tube and incubated
with 10 μL of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled
mouse anti human CD14 antibody (ABD Serotec Inc.,
Raleigh, NC, USA). This was mixed (Barnstead Thermolyne, Dubuque, IOWA, USA) thoroughly and incubated at
room temperature on an orbitron rotator (Boekel Ind.
Inc., PA, USA) for 30 minutes. Lysis and fixation of erythrocytes was done by adding 2 mL of lysing solution
(PHAGOTEST® Kit, Orpegen Pharma, Heidelberg, Germany) to the mixture. This was mixed gently, incubated
for 20 minutes on an orbitron rotator at room temperature and centrifuged at 250 g for 5 minutes at 4°C. The
supernatant was aspirated leaving approximately 400 μL
of cells in the FCM tube. This was washed with 3 mL of
Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) pH 7.2
(Life Technologies) by centrifuging at 250 g for 5 minutes
at 4°C. The supernatant was aspirated as described above
and the cells resuspended in 1 mL of DPBS and analyzed
by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson Immunocytochemistry Systems, San José, CA, USA) within 30 minutes. Excitation of samples was at 488 nm; with FITC fluorescence
measured at 525 nm ± 10 nm. Acquisition was stopped
when 20,000 gated events were collected in the fluorescence cell count histogram. Gating of monocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes was based on forward scatter
and side scatter dot plots by encircling the populations
with amorphous regions. All parameters were recorded
with logarithmic amplifications. List mode flow cytometric data from 20,000 events were stored and processed
with the Windows Multiple Document Interface for flow
cytometry (WinMDI) software version 2.8 (Joseph Trotter,
The Sripps Research Institute, http://facs.scripps.edu/soft
ware.html) on a personal computer.
The viability of neutrophils and monocytes in whole
blood was determined by propidium iodide (PI) exclu-

sion (50 μg/mL, final concentration) using flow cytometry after cells were incubated for 10 minutes in the dark at
room temperature. The cells showed 99% viability.
Statistical analysis
Allele frequencies were estimated with GENEPOP program [33] while haplotypes and their frequencies were
determined with the program PHASE V2.1.1 [34,35].
PHASE implements a Bayesian method of haplotype
reconstruction based on genealogies reconstructed from
coalescent theory under a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
framework and has been shown to outperform other strategies such as the maximum likelihood expectation maximization algorithm in most cases [35].

Flow cytometric data were analyzed as a one-way ANOVA
using the MIXED procedure SAS [36]. Treatment means
were separated using the least square means option of
SAS. Differences between treatment means were tested
using Scheffe's Multiple Comparison test and statistical
significance was declared at P < 0.05.
