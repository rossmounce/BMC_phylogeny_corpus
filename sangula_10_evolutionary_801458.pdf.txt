Abstract
Background: In East Africa, foot-and-mouth disease virus serotype SAT 1 is responsible for occasional severe
outbreaks in livestock and is known to be maintained within the buffalo populations. Little is known about the
evolutionary forces underlying its epidemiology in the region. To enhance our appreciation of the epidemiological
status of serotype SAT 1 virus in the region, we inferred its evolutionary and phylogeographic history by means of
genealogy-based coalescent methods using 53 VP1 coding sequences covering a sampling period from 1948-2007.
Results: The VP1 coding sequence of 11 serotype SAT 1 FMD viruses from East Africa has been determined and
compared with known sequences derived from other SAT 1 viruses from sub-Saharan Africa. Purifying (negative)
selection and low substitution rates characterized the SAT 1 virus isolates in East Africa. Two virus groups with
probable independent introductions from southern Africa were identified from a maximum clade credibility tree.
One group was exclusive to Uganda while the other was present within Kenya and Tanzania.
Conclusions: Our results provide a baseline characterization of the inter-regional spread of SAT 1 in sub-Saharan
Africa and highlight the importance of a regional approach to trans-boundary animal disease control in order to
monitor circulating strains and apply appropriate vaccines.

Background
Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is an acute, highly
communicable and economically important disease of livestock and it also affects wild ruminants [1]. The causative
agent, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) belongs to
the Aphthovirus genus in the family Picornaviridae. Its
positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of 8.5 kb is
translated into a polyprotein which is post-translationally
cleaved to 4 structural (VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4) and 8 nonstructural proteins [2]. The structural proteins form the
capsid of the virion and, with the exception of VP4, are
surface exposed. The VP1 is involved in the interaction
with the host cells via the RGD-dependent integrins [3].
The coding sequence for VP1 has been widely used in

studies of evolutionary dynamics of FMDV needed for the
understanding of the epidemiological patterns of these
viruses and for determining possible sources of outbreaks
[4-6]. The genetic diversity of FMDV is a consequence of
the high mutation rate due to the error-prone RNA polymerase lacking proofreading activity [7].
There are seven immunologically distinct serotypes
(O, A, C, SAT 1, SAT 2, SAT 3 and Asia 1) of FMDV,
each with a wide spectrum of antigenic and epidemiological subtypes distributed around the world [5]. The
Southern Africa Territories (SAT) serotypes are
restricted in their distribution mainly to sub-Saharan
Africa and they co-exist with the Euro-Asiatic (O, A, C)
serotypes in the East African region although serotype C
has not been reported since 2004. In southern Africa,
the epidemiology of the SAT serotypes is mainly associated with African buffalos (Syncerus caffer) which act
as reservoirs and sources of outbreaks [8,9]. In eastern

Africa, FMD is prevalent in wildlife and within the
African buffalo in particular although their role in the
epidemiology of the disease has not been as widely studied as in southern Africa. Most outbreaks of FMD in
the region are reported among livestock populations.
The African buffalo has been reported to be a carrier of
the SAT serotypes but not the Euro-Asiatic serotypes in
East Africa [10-12]. This is similar to the situation in
southern Africa. Widespread animal movements in the
eastern Africa region are possibly responsible for longterm circulation and reintroductions of FMDV strains,
including SAT 1 [13]. However, little quantitative information exists about the extent of such livestock and
wildlife mediated dispersal of FMDV as well as the origin and evolutionary history of the SAT 1 viruses circulating in eastern Africa [13,14]. Furthermore, the
connectivity between the individual countries and the
main routes of dispersal remain unknown, although
such information would be of great value in containing
the spread of the disease and avoiding introduction of
novel strains against which existing vaccine programs
may offer little protection.
We have investigated the emergence of FMDV SAT 1
diversity in the region by inferring the phylogeographic
history by means of genealogy-based coalescent methods. Furthermore, we have tested for evidence of recombination in the data set which is known to bias
phylogenetic inferences as described previously [15-17].

Results
Phylogenetic relationships, substitution rates and
divergence times

The VP1 coding sequences of 11 additional serotype
SAT 1 FMD viruses from East Africa have been determined. Using this information, the complete VP1 coding
sequences of 8 southern Africa, 14 western Africa, 3
Sudanese, 1 Ethiopian and 27 East Africa FMD serotype
SAT 1 viruses from the period 1948 to 2007 were analysed to determine phylogenetic relationships, phylogeography, divergence times and substitution rates. Dating
of the common root of the samples showed considerable
uncertainty in determination with a mean estimate for
the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) at 538
years before present (ybp) (95% highest posterior density
(HPD): 228-897 ybp). The inferred maximum clade
credibility (MCC) tree is shown in Figure 1 with the
posterior probabilities for the branches shown. The East
African SAT 1 viruses formed two main clades
(lineages) labelled A and B supported by high posterior
probabilities. The Ugandan viruses differed from those
of Tanzania and Kenya and are of mainly one lineage
(A) while one isolate (UGA/13/74) grouped with viruses
of the Sudan and western Africa. Kenyan and Tanzanian
viruses grouped together in lineage B and were related to

Page 2 of 8

a Zimbabwean isolate. Only little geographic structure
was observed within lineage B isolates from Kenya and
Tanzania, suggesting high migration rates between these
countries. The mean nt substitution rate was 1.30 × 10-3
substitutions/site/year (s/s/yr) (95% HPD: 5.43 × 10-42.18 × 10-3 ) with distinct variation in rates among the
clades. We analysed the East African viruses (comprising
27 samples) separately in BEAST and found relatively
lower rates at 2.75 × 10-4 s/s/yr (4.69 × 10-5-7.39 × 10-4),
while the western African viruses (comprising 14 samples) had higher rates at 6.91 × 10-3s/s/yr (3.32 × 10-31.04 × 10-2).
While the location of the root of the SAT1 tree could
not be identified with particular confidence (Bayes factor, BF = 1.5 comparing the posterior probability of the
root being in southern Africa against Sudan), there was
relatively strong support for the location of several of
the remaining nodes in the MCC tree (Figure 1). From
the location-annotated MCC tree, two separate introductions from southern Africa to East Africa were supported by the data, namely one leading to lineage A and
one leading to lineage B. In addition, there was strong
support for two separate introductions of SAT 1 from
Sudan to western Africa. Bayes factor tests revealed that
the most significant routes of inter-regional dispersal
were the Sudan-western Africa (BF = 21.4) and southern
Africa-Kenya/Tanzania (BF = 4.5). No link between the
Ugandan and the Kenyan/Tanzanian samples (between
lineage A and B) could be identified, and this was in
fact found to be the link with the second-lowest posterior support. The western Africa-Kenya/Tanzania link
had the lowest support (results not shown).
Predominant purifying selection in the VP1 coding region
of FMDV SAT 1

The majority of codons in the VP1 coding region of
FMDV SAT 1 appeared to be under purifying (negative)
selection. Of the 221 codons analysed, 153 were found
to be under negative selection using three methods
(single-likelihood ancestor counting, SLAC, at P = 0.1,
fixed effects likelihood, FEL, at P = 0.1 and random
effects likelihood, REL, with BF > 50) as summarized in
Table 1. Five sites (codons 47, 61, 99, 143 and 147)
were identified to be under positive selection by at least
one method but no site was identified by all the three
methods together at values of P = 0.1 (SLAC and FEL)
or BF > 50 (REL). However, at P = 0.2, codon 147 (H/
N/E/T, 2 codon positions before the receptor binding
motif RGD) was identified by all the methods and was
mostly likely to be under true positive selection.
The genetic algorithm (GA) branch analysis showed
that 5 rate classes were supported with a large number
of models (over 1500 in the 95% confidence set). No
branches had significant support for dN >dS although

Information Criterion (AIC c ) of more than100 which
suggested support for the recombination model while
the Kishino-Hasegewa test showed support for significant topological incongruence at P = 0.01. Indeed, the
exploratory analysis using the recombination detection
programme (RDP2) had at least one method detect
some recombinant sequences (TAN/60/99 and K66/80).
However, further analysis did not support the view that
these sequences were recombinant and the exclusion of
these sequences from the analysis did not affect the phylogenetic results, indicating that they are not likely to be
true recombinants (results not shown).

Discussion
FMDV serotype SAT 1 virus strains from East Africa
analysed in this study grouped into 2 distinct clades
(lineages with > 20% nucleotide divergence) designated

Sangula et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:371
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/371

here as lineages A and B. While one of these lineages
(A) was found exclusively in Uganda, the other had
virus strains from Tanzania and Kenya. Over the whole
sampling period, Kenyan and Tanzanian isolates were
interspersed in one clade of the phylogenetic tree, suggesting that these countries form a single ecosystem for
SAT 1. The separate introduction of lineages A and B
to eastern Africa from southern Africa was supported by
the high posterior probabilities of the location states in
the phylogeographic analysis. A close association of
Kenyan/Tanzanian and southern African lineages has
been observed earlier [13], but the link between Ugandan and southern Africa lineages reported here reveals a
previously undiscovered aspect of the ancestry of the
East African SAT 1 lineages. This new finding was not
due to a different data set, but rather to our Bayesian
phylogeographic analysis framework. When we constructed a neighbour-joining tree using similar methods
to [13] using our data set, we were not able to infer a
southern African origin for the Ugandan lineage.
Several interesting aspects about the history of subSaharan SAT 1 viruses emerge from our continental phylogeographic approach. First, we found that the most
likely root location of SAT 1 is in southern Africa.
Because of the relatively deep root of the tree (~538 ybp),
we could not achieve unequivocal posterior support for
this root location (also see [18]). We found a strong link
between western African and Sudanese SAT 1 sequences
(in agreement with [13]) and our results suggest that the
route of entry of SAT 1 into western Africa has been
along the Sahel rather than through the rain forest belt
surrounding equatorial Africa. A Ugandan isolate from
1974 was found to belong to a lineage otherwise consisting of Sudanese, Ethiopian and western African strains,
and the phylogeographic analysis suggested this was an
incursion from Sudan. Hence, Ugandan SAT 1 strains
appear to be derived from two different sources, southern
Africa and Sudan, respectively.
The sampling scheme used in this study may to some
extent have affected the outcome of the phylogeographic
analysis. For example, we cannot exclude that the inclusion of more samples from Uganda would alter the posterior state probability of some nodes in the tree to
reflect an earlier introduction of SAT 1 into Uganda.
Given that Uganda is represented in both of the two
major clades, it may have played a more prominent role
connecting southern African SAT 1 viruses with those
of Sudan, Ethiopia and western Africa. Such a scenario
seems plausible given the central location of Uganda
according to our definition of location states. Furthermore, we cannot exclude that additional samples from
Uganda will show phylogenetic affinity with the surrounding countries. This could be tested by acquiring
more Ugandan samples. In fact, more recent SAT 1

Page 4 of 8

virus isolates from Uganda have grouped within the
Ugandan lineage A [19], in agreement with the phylogeographic conclusions reported here. In general, however, we stress that our findings should be viewed as a
null hypothesis about continental SAT 1 dispersal
against which studies based on more comprehensive
sampling can be tested. Denser sampling (both temporally and spatially) can be expected to reveal novel dispersal patterns not observed here and further address
the fine-scale historical movement of the serotype.
The substitution rate inferred in our study differs considerably from [20]. This leads to a significantly deeper
tree, and hence it is difficult for us to put our results
into a historical context that includes all FMDV serotypes. Our mean estimate of 538 ybp for the TMRCA of
SAT 1 actually predates that of the whole FMDV found
in [20], although it is within the 95% HPDs reported in
that study (218-1250 ybp). We caution that the time
line of our phylogeographic tree should not be regarded
as conclusive and that further studies are needed to
establish the rate of evolution in FMDV. Our inferred
rate is, however, closer to the reported mean rate of
evolution across all serotypes (2.48 × 10-3) for the VP1
coding sequence [20]. In [20], the SAT 1 virus sequence
was found to have a roughly 3-fold faster rate than the
species average. We speculate that this exceptionally fast
rate could be derived from the sampling scheme in [20],
where many of the included SAT 1 isolates are from the
same epidemic outbreaks. This tends to yield faster
rates of evolution, since what is recovered is actually the
mutation rate rather than the long-term substitution
rate subject to selection and other forces [21], leading to
a bias towards higher rates and a shallower tree. In
accordance with this, we did find much faster rates of
evolution in the western African samples; all collected
during two epidemic outbreaks each spanning just two
years. However, regionally variable evolutionary rates
may in fact reflect real differences in the epidemiological
dynamics and host-interaction of FMDV. For example,
buffalos and other wildlife may play a more prominent
role in the epidemiology of SAT 1 in eastern than in
western Africa, and this may give rise to changed patterns of evolution of virus lineages in the two regions.
Considerable localized differentiation in evolutionary
rates has not previously been observed in FMDV, and
although potentially informative concerning epidemiology and evolution, it also complicates evolutionary estimates based on global or widespread sample collections.
Given these two (not necessarily mutually exclusive)
causes of the observed rate heterogeneity, it is vital that
future studies address the caveats in using the VP1 coding sequence to infer evolutionary rates and history.
Purifying (negative) selection was the most predominant evolutionary force at play among the SAT 1

Sangula et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:371

viruses. At least 153 codon positions including the RGD
motif (amino acid residue positions 149-151) of VP1,
required for receptor interaction, were estimated to be
under purifying selection signifying amino acid conservation as reflected in the low evolutionary rates. There
was less evidence for positive selection although a few
sites may have been under adaptive selection. Amino
acid sites that are distinct between the regional virus
groups as well as conservation of the RGD motif were
observed when inferred using MEGA version 4 [22] and
is in agreement with previous reports [13]. These evolutionary patterns may reflect the observed apparent long
term circulation of some virus strains in the region previously reported in [13]. It has also been observed that
genetic heterogeneity may be limited by evolutionary
constraints [23]. There was no evidence for the presence
of recombination within the VP1 coding sequences (in
agreement with observations that recombination is largely restricted to non-structural coding regions with
very few phylogenetic incongruities in the capsid proteins [24-26]) adding confidence to our results.

Conclusions
We have inferred the most likely phylogeographic history of SAT 1 in sub-Saharan Africa. We found evidence that the SAT 1 viruses circulating in Uganda and
Kenya/Tanzania represent independent phylogeographic
lineages. Kenya and Tanzania appear to experience a
much greater exchange of viruses at their respective
southern and northern borders through the transboundary livestock and wildlife movements (a common
feature in this area) than with Uganda. This highlights
the importance of a regional approach to trans-boundary animal disease control. It is apparent from the SAT
1 analysis presented here that monitoring of the emerging strains in the region is required for the success of
vaccination strategies.

Phylogeographic analysis

In addition to the eleven sequences generated in the
study, 42 (17 from East Africa and 25 the rest of Africa)
other complete VP1 coding sequences available in the
GenBank covering a sampling period from 1948-2007
were included to put the results from East Africa into a
continental SAT 1 context.
The sequences were assembled and aligned using the
software program Geneious version 4.6 [29]. The best
fitting nucleotide substitution model was tested by
means of a hierarchical likelihood ratio test (LRT) and
the Akaike information criteria (AIC) as implemented in
MrModeltest version 2.2 software [30] and executed in
PAUP* version 4b10 software [31]. The selected model
was general time-reversible (GTR) [32] with gammadistributed rates among sites and a proportion of invariable sites.
Phylogenetic relationships, evolutionary rates and
population size changes were co-estimated for the whole
data set and geographic subsets using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method implemented
in the BEAST (Bayesian evolutionary analysis sampling
trees) software version 1.6.0 package [33]http://beast.bio.
ed.ac.uk using the selected model of nucleotide substitution. The method utilizes the sampling time of the
sequences to infer rates of evolution along lineages, time
of TMRCA and demographic history. A recent extension of the software allows tracking of the geographic
location state along the phylogenetic tree, yielding posterior estimates of the location of each branch/node in
the tree given the phylogenetic uncertainties [18]. Given
our limited data set with low representation of many
countries, we defined the geographical states as six
coherent regions roughly corresponding to areas

separated by known topotype boundaries. The regions
include: western Africa, Ethiopia, Sudan, Uganda,
Kenya/Tanzania and southern Africa (Table 2). We used
a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS)
without distance informed priors on diffusion rates, as
this has been shown not to improve confidence in the
phylogeographical state assignment when dispersal patterns are complex such as with many viruses (e.g. [18]).
Rate indicator log files were inspected in Tracer software version 1.4 http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/,
and Bayes factor tests were carried out to test the most
significant routes of dispersal using the Rate Indicator
BF tool of the BEAST package.
In a preliminary analysis, we tested four different
demographic models/coalescent priors as suggested in
[33]. In addition, we tested the appropriateness of a
strict clock versus various versions of relaxed clocks
available in BEAST [34]. This process of model selection
suggested the constant population size model with an
uncorrelated exponential clock to be the best fit to the
data. We used a HKY+G+I substitution model [35] with
four rate categories, as in a recent influenza study ([18],
Additional file 1). The MCMC chains were run long
enough (100 million steps) to allow high effective sample sizes (ESSs) (above 250 for most parameters, minimum 100 for all parameters) with a 10% burn-in as
viewed in Tracer. Statistical uncertainties of the substitution rates and the MRCA were summarized as the
lower 95%, mean, and upper 95% values of the HPD
interval. Mean evolutionary rates (averaged over
branches weighted by their lengths) were measured as
the number of nucleotide substitution per site per year
(s/s/y). Maximum clade credibility trees were obtained
using Tree Annotator program in BEAST and visualized
with FigTree version 1.1.2 software http://tree.bio.ed.ac.
uk/software/figtree/.
Selection and recombination detection

Tests for selection were performed using four methods
which estimate selection in a phylogenetic context available in the Datamonkey web interface [36]. The best-fitting nucleotide substitution model was selected using
the automated link. To identify codon sites under positive (adaptive) or negative (purifying) selection, we used
the single-likelihood ancestor counting, the fixed effects
likelihood and the random effects likelihood methods.
The SLAC and FEL methods estimate selection on a
site-by-site basis with the former method comparing
observed to expected synonymous and non-synonymous
rates while the latter uses two models which assume
independent and equal rates and a likelihood ratio test
to determine significance. The REL method determines
independent general discrete distributions for the global
synonymous and non-synonymous rates using a codon

based model which are then used as priors for Empirical
Bayes analysis of site selection [36]. The integrative
selection analysis option in Datamonkey was then used
to increase confidence on the estimation of selection at
a site if all three methods support it. To test the hypothesis that different selective environments were acting on
the branches of the phylogeny, we used the GA branch
method to estimate dN/dS.
To add confidence to our coalescent inferences, the
presence of recombination in the data was tested using
the GARD method [37] on the Datamonkey server with
topological incongruence significance estimated by the
Kishino-Hasegawa test [38] and also by the exploratory
methods implemented in RDP version 2 beta 0.8 software [39] which included; RDP, [40] GENECONV, [41]
Bootscan, [42] MaxChi, [43] and Chimaera [44].
