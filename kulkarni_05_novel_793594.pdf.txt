Background: The G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are one of the largest protein families
in human and other animal genomes, but no more than 10 GPCRs have been characterized in fungi.
Do fungi contain only this handful or are there more receptors to be discovered? We asked this
question using the recently sequenced genome of the fungal plant pathogen Magnaporthe grisea.

Cell-surface G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) bind exogenous as well as endogenous ligands such as photons, odorants, lipids, nucleotides, hormones, pheromones, peptides
and proteins. Interaction with these ligands drives diverse
processes such as photoreception, taste and olfactory sensa-

tions in animals, mating in fungi and cell-cell communications in slime molds [1-3]. These receptors are characterized
by seven transmembrane α-helices that upon ligand binding
relay the signal by bringing about conformational changes in
bound G proteins. The extracellular amino terminus in most
cases interacts with the ligand and the carboxyl terminus with

Conclusion: In M. grisea we identified homologs of known GPCRs and a novel class of GPCR-like
receptors specific to filamentous ascomycetes. A member of this new class, PTH11, is required for
pathogenesis, thus suggesting roles in pathogenicity for other members. The identified classes
constitute the largest number of GPCR-like proteins reported in fungi to date.

Results: Proteins with significant similarity to fungus-specific and other eukaryotic GPCRs were
identified in M. grisea. These included homologs of known fungal GPCRs, the cAMP receptors from
Dictyostelium, and a steroid receptor mPR. We also identified a novel class of receptors typified by
PTH11, a cell-surface integral membrane protein required for pathogenicity. PTH11 has seven
transmembrane regions and an amino-terminal extracellular cysteine-rich EGF-like domain (CFEM
domain), a characteristic also seen in human GPCRs. Sixty-one PTH11-related proteins were
identified in M. grisea that shared a common domain with homologs in Neurospora crassa and other
fungi belonging to this subphylum of the Ascomycota (the Pezizomycotina). None was detected in
other fungal groups (Basidiomycota or other Ascomycota subphyla, including yeasts) or any other
eukaryote. The subclass of PTH11 containing the CFEM domain is highly represented in M. grisea.

G proteins. The G proteins in turn activate different signaling
pathways, such as those activated by adenylate cyclase and
phospholipase C. These GPCRs are of immense importance as
they are major targets for drug discovery [4].
A classification scheme that encompasses all GPCRs is the
grouping into classes A-E [5]. A-C are the main classes
present in animals: class A is the largest and comprises the
rhodopsin-like receptors, class B comprises the secretin-like
receptors and class C the metabotropic glutamate/pheromone receptors. Class D is unique to fungi and comprises fungal
pheromone receptors. Class E contains cAMP receptors, such
as the cAMP receptors of Dictyostelium. Other classes include
frizzled/smoothened, adhesion receptors and the insect-specific chemosensory receptors [6,7]. Sequence conservation
between GPCR classes is limited, however, with each receptor
class exhibiting specific identifiable characteristics [6,8]. The
secretin and the adhesion receptors are characterized by conserved cysteine residues or by known cysteine-rich domains
resembling the epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain at
their amino termini.
GPCRs form the largest family of receptors in animals, with
more than 600 members in the human genome [9,10]. Only a
handful of GPCRs have been identified in fungal genomes,
however. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe only three and four receptors, respectively, are
well characterized [1,11-16]. In the Neurospora crassa
genome a total of 10 receptors is predicted [17]. A recent
report for Aspergillus nidulans identified GPCRs similar to
the yeast pheromone receptors, the glucose-sensing receptor
GPR1, the nitrogen-starvation sensing STM1, and the Dictyostelium discoideum cAMP receptors [18]. Given the prevalence and significance of GPCRs in higher eukaryotes, their
relative paucity in the kingdom Fungi warranted further
investigation. To see if we could find additional families, we
searched the predicted proteome of the rice blast fungus
Magnaporthe grisea.
The fungal plant pathogen M. grisea is a powerful model system to study the pathogenicity determinants required for
plant cell-surface recognition and production of an appressorium, a specialized structure required to penetrate the plant
surface [19,20]. The fungus causes rice blast disease, the most
destructive disease of rice worldwide. M. grisea is amenable
to molecular genetic manipulation and the subject of largescale genome-wide functional studies following the recent
completion of a draft genome sequence [21]. Infection begins
when a conidium, attached to the plant surface, sends forth a
germ tube that differentiates to form a highly melanized
appressorium. Turgor pressure inside the appressorium
results in a penetration hypha breaching the cell wall and
invasion of the plant tissues. This developmental program,
which is accompanied by a number of biochemical and developmental changes, is a result of perception by the fungus of

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/3/R24

appropriate environmental and plant cell-surface signals and
induction of a cascade of signaling pathways.
Cell-surface receptors that perceive signals at critical times in
the life cycle of M. grisea and other pathogenic fungi are
strongly implicated as pathogenicity determinants. Signaling
plays a key role in appressorium formation and infection in
M. grisea. The cAMP-dependent and pheromone response,
as well as other mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-,
phospholipase- and calmodulin-dependent pathways, are
essential for pathogenicity and are likely to involve perception of signals through GPCRs [22-24]. The three identified
G-protein alpha subunits, required for different aspects of
development and pathogenicity, possibly transduce perceived
signals to the above-mentioned pathways [25]. The M. grisea
G proteins probably receive signals from receptors such as
PTH11, an integral membrane protein required for pathogenicity [26]. As animal GPCRs are important targets for drug
discovery, identifying fungal receptors would be equally
important for understanding and controlling M. grisea and
other fungal pathogens.
Identification of new GPCR classes is difficult because of low
sequence similarity; even within related classes, sequence
conservation is limited to the membrane-spanning regions
[8]. There are also large variations in the type and number of
receptors in classes that show no sequence or structural similarities to each other. We therefore carried out an exhaustive
analysis to mine the proteome of the sequenced genome of the
rice blast fungus M. grisea for GPCR-like proteins. Homologs
of known fungal GPCRs were found in the M. grisea proteome, including the pheromone receptors STE2 and STE3
and the glucose-sensing receptor GPR1. In total, 76 GPCRlike proteins were identified in the present study of which 61
represent a large novel class related to PTH11, a receptor
implicated in fungal development and pathogenicity and proposed to act upstream of the cAMP-dependent pathway.
Many of these novel receptors will have roles in known pathways or may define new pathways involved in fungal
development.

Results
Identification of novel classes of GPCR-like proteins in
M. grisea
We searched the M. grisea proteome for GPCR-like proteins
on the basis of their similarity to known receptors. GPCR
sequences including all present in the GPCR database
(GPCRDB [5]) were used as a query in a BLASTP search
against the M. grisea predicted protein set [21]. The proteins
retrieved in this search were used to BLAST the M. grisea
proteins again to find all related sequences (Table 1). A total
of 14 GPCR-like proteins were found. These included
homologs of characterized fungal GPCRs (GPR1, STM1, and
the STE2- and STE3-like pheromone receptors). Other proteins identified were similar to the cAMP receptors and to

Classes of GPCR-like protein in M. grisea were subdivided on the basis of BLASTP analysis and shared domains, as described in Materials and methods.
They were clustered into paralogous families if the proteins showed 30% identity and 80% overlap over the complete length of the protein.
Paralogous families are separated by a blank line. The GPCR-like proteins in M. grisea could be classified into nine subclasses containing more than one
member and 48 containing a single member. Six subclasses contained two members, two contained three and one contained six. *M. grisea proteins

The receptor PTH11 in M. grisea is required for development
of the appressorium [26]. It is an integral membrane protein
and has been localized to the cell membrane. It is proposed to
act upstream of the cAMP pathway, which is required for

pathogenicity. The PTH11 amino-terminal domain contains
an EGF-like cysteine rich CFEM domain, predicted to be
extracellular, followed by seven transmembrane regions [29].
Based on the transmembrane topology, with the amino-terminal outside and the carboxy-terminal inside, PTH11 is a
novel GPCR-like protein. PTH11 has been reported to have
nine transmembrane regions; however, the two putative
transmembrane regions at the amino-terminal end are the
predicted signal sequence and the hydrophobic region within
the extracellular CFEM domain, respectively, and are therefore not membrane spanning [26,29]. The CFEM domain is
an EGF-like domain, characteristically present in the extracellular regions of membrane proteins; thus PTH11 is characterized as having an extracellular amino-terminal CFEM
domain, followed by seven transmembrane regions. A
BLASTP search using PTH11 as query against known M. grisea proteins retrieved a number of proteins with seven transmembrane regions (E-value cutoff of 1e-09). A BLASTP
search using these PTH11-related proteins against M. grisea
predicted proteins returned additional members within this

mPR, a steroid receptor. No homologs of the animal rhodopsin-, secretin- and metabotropic-like receptor classes,
which form the majority of the proteins in GPCRDB, could be
found. All proteins listed in the table were checked to make
sure they had seven transmembrane regions (Additional data
file 1). The M. grisea proteins were searched with InterProScan [27] and 16 proteins associated with InterPro entries containing the terms 'GPCR' or 'G protein-coupled receptors'
were identified. Four were already identified in the above
BLAST searches. Of the remaining 12, only one (MG00532.4)
had seven transmembrane regions and was added to Table 1.
This protein had weak similarity to rat growth hormonereleasing factor receptor and other GPCRs. A PfamA HMM
search revealed that some of the proteins identified above had
characteristic GPCR domains (Table 1, and see [28]).

class (total 61, Table 1). Only a subset of the retrieved proteins
contained the CFEM domain, as indicated in Table 1 (12
CFEM-containing proteins).
In total we identified 76 receptors, including members of
known classes as well as novel classes. Sixty-one represented
a novel class that included PTH11. All other receptors identified were assigned to different classes on the basis of their
similarity to known receptors using BLASTP against the GenBank (nonredundant) and Swiss-Prot databases, and their
conserved domain characteristics. We found three members
of the mPR class and one (MG0532.4) with weak similarity to
animal GPCRs. No members of these classes have been
reported previously in fungi. Within each class, members
were assigned to paralogous families (Table 1). Many of the
genes in Table 1 are expressed, as suggested by representation
in expressed sequence tags or microarray experiments. A
BLAST search against the GenBank EST databases revealed
that some of the predicted open reading frames (ORFs) had
matches in the M. grisea ESTs (Table 1, and see [30]). Results
from microarray experiments on gene expression during
conidia germination and appressorium formation also
showed that many of these ORFs are expressed (T.K. Mitchell
and R.A.D, unpublished work).

Shared and unique GPCR-like protein classes in M.
grisea
M. grisea GPCRs were compared with published fungal
genome sequence databases to identify proteins belonging to
the same GPCR classes. A BLASTP search against the genome
of the closely related filamentous fungus N. crassa [17], using
all the M. grisea GPCR-like proteins as query, revealed the
presence of similar proteins in N. crassa, including PTH11
homologs (Table 2 and Additional data file 2). No PTH11

homologs were found in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe. Further
analysis revealed putative homologs of the mPR-1 class in
both yeasts, in which they had not previously been identified.
In addition, we found no evidence for cAMP receptor-like
GPCRs in either yeast, unlike both M. grisea and N. crassa.
The cAMP, STM1, and mPR receptors are shared between
fungi and other eukaryotic species. However, the fungal pheromone receptors (class D) and GPR1-like receptors appear to
be fungus-specific.
Members of the large class of PTH11-related receptors were
restricted to a fungal subphylum. BLASTP of all the PTH11
class members, and PSI-BLAST using conserved regions,
against the GenBank (nonredundant) and Swiss-Prot databases and publicly available fungal genomes retrieved
matches in members of the subphylum Pezizomycotina
within the Ascomycota, including Podospora anserina,
Blumeria graminis, Fusarium graminearum and Aspergillus species. Other fungi belonging to the Ascomycota but not
to this subphylum, such as S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, Candida
albicans and Pneumocystis carinii lacked PTH11-related
sequences. Also, no PTH11-related sequences were found in
the genomes of the Basidiomycetes Cryptococcus neoformans, Ustilago maydis and Phanerochaete chrysosporium. No
matches were found in plant, animal or prokaryotic genomes.

Phylogenetic analysis of PTH11-related GPCR-like
proteins in M. grisea and N. crassa
PTH11-related receptors from M. grisea and N. crassa were
classified into paralogous families (Additional data file 2). We
also identified any that were orthologs between these two species. PTH11-related receptors in M. grisea and N. crassa and
other sequences from P. anserina and B. graminis were
aligned to determine any relationships. The region containing

Figure 1 (see previous on the
Gene phylogeny based page) conserved membrane-spanning PTH11-domain
Gene phylogeny based on the conserved membrane-spanning PTH11-domain. The tree shown was constructed using parsimony methods. Numbers on
branches represent bootstrap values based on 100 random dataset simulations. Open ovals indicate putative paralogs and filled ovals the M. grisea-N. crassa
orthologs. For sequences other than the ones predicted from M. grisea and N. crassa genome sequences the GenBank accession numbers are indicated.
The abbreviations for species names are indicated in parentheses after the accession numbers as follows: BG, Blumeria graminis; PA, Podospora anserina;
NC, N. crassa. The product of the gene PTH11 was referred to as Pth11p in the original report. Subsequently it has been referred to as PTH11. We refer
to this gene product as PTH11 in this paper and would like to propose revision of its name from Pth11p to PTH11.

the conserved PTH11-domain was used to build a phylogenetic tree (Figures 1, 2a). Our analysis indicated that PTH11related proteins form a large and divergent protein family
that evolved before the divergence of M. grisea and N. crassa.
M. grisea and N. crassa orthologs occurred in the same
clades (Figure 1). Many different clades on the tree may represent paralogous sequences. The tree supports the putative
orthologs and paralogs we identified (see Additional data file
2). Even though only the PTH11 domain was used to build the
tree (the amino-terminal CFEM domain seen in a few proteins was not included), the 13 CFEM domain-containing proteins occurred together in one clade, indicating that the
sequences are closely related. The phylogeny also revealed
that within certain clades there was a marked expansion of
the PTH11-related proteins in M. grisea compared to N.
crassa. This is particularly notable for the CFEM domaincontaining proteins. There were six M. grisea members containing the CFEM domain in a paralogous family (Table 1 and
Figure 1; a total of 12 related CFEM and seven-span proteins),
but only one from N. crassa. We found 38 PTH11-related proteins in A. nidulans with an E-value less than 1e-09. Further
characterization of these proteins will be required to define
the number of seven-span PTH11-related proteins in this
genome. Preliminary analysis shows that only two seven-span
proteins contain the CFEM domain in A. nidulans. These
observations could represent either expansion since speciation of the CFEM-containing PTH11 relatives in M. grisea, or
loss of these proteins in the other fungal species.

New domain signatures as defined by conserved
regions in homologous classes of identified receptors
Members of each class of M. grisea GPCR-like proteins
described above, for example, cAMP-, STM1-like, PTH11related receptors, have domains that are conserved within
each class. Sequence alignments from the BLASTP searches
revealed specific regions containing shared residues for each
of these classes of receptors. Figure 2 shows an alignment for
some of the sequences that belong to classes other than the
better-studied pheromone and glucose-sensing receptors. In
all the PTH11-related members the region towards the amino
terminus was conserved (Figure 2a, PTH11_dom). The
extreme amino-terminal and the carboxy-terminal sequences
flanking this region were divergent. Conserved residues
occurred within the seven-span regions for all of these proteins. This is consistent with other observations that sequence
conservation is typically limited to the transmembrane
regions in GPCRs. The M. grisea protein MG06738.4, which

has similarity to the cAMP receptors, shared conserved
amino-acid residues between positions 81-179 with
MG06797.4, MG00326.4, MG06257.4, related N. crassa proteins and other cAMP receptors (cAMP_dom, Figure 2b).
Other proteins - MG00258.4 and MG10544.4 - with weak
similarity to cAMP receptors also shared residues within this
domain (data not shown). MG04698.4 shared two domains
between amino-acid residues 22-101 and 244-327 with STM1,
MG02855.4 and related proteins from different eukaryotic
species (stm1_dom, Figure 2c). MG05072.4 shared residues
within the region of 56-277 with MG09091.4 (residues 18228), MG04679.4 (residues 260-497) and other proteins that
were retrieved in the BLAST search, including mPR receptors
(mPR_dom, Figure 2d).
The proteins containing the PFAM GPCR domains are indicated in Table 1. It is worth noting that the low scores for the
PFAM domains that we observed may be due to the need to
update these domain alignments by adding many new proteins, including those we discovered. For example,
MG06452.4 contains a putative STE3 domain; the alignment
score (E-value) is low, however. With the new fungal genomes
being sequenced, more STE3 homolog sequences are available and inclusion of these in the seed alignment defining the
STE3 domain will make the domain more representative for
fungal STE3 domains.
Each class of receptors contained specific conserved regions
within the membrane-spanning topology. A representative
example of each class, showing the location of the conserved
region within the membrane topology is illustrated in Figure
3. For fungus-specific receptors, the conserved domain
spanned almost the entire length of the seven transmembrane regions. When other eukaryotic receptors were
included in the class, however, only shorter conserved
domains were discerned. These conserved residues may
reflect functional constraints and may be valuable for studying the structure-function relationships of these proteins.

Discussion
Distinct classes of GPCR-like proteins identified in M.
grisea
Fungi respond to a variety of signals from the environment
that regulate cellular metabolism and development as well as
host-pathogen interactions. Cell-surface receptors perceive
these signals and relay them to intracellular signaling path-

Unique classes of fungal G-protein-coupled receptors

interactions

The PTH11-related proteins form a large and divergent protein family, as suggested by the similarity between the proteins and the phylogenetic tree (Table 1, Figure 1). This gene
family may have evolved before the divergence of M. grisea
and N. crassa. There are a few orthologs between these species; however, it is apparent that this family has undergone
considerable expansion in M. grisea compared to N. crassa,
with the largest subclass in M. grisea being the CFEM-containing proteins. Many of the PTH11-related genes are located
in close proximity to each other on the genome (data not
shown), whereas none of the other GPCR-like proteins,

Relationships between the PTH11-related proteins

deposited research

Having diverged approximately 1,460 million years ago
(Mya) [33], it is clear that fungi have classes of GPCRs that are
distinct from those of animals. The class D fungal pheromone
receptors define a fungus-specific class of receptors. We
found the GPR1-like receptors to be also fungal specific.
Classes of receptors specific to a group of species also occur in
animals. For example, some of GPCRs in Anopheles gambiae
constitute an insect-specific class of chemosensory receptors
[7]. Insects are estimated to have diverged from other animals
nearly 1,000 Mya. Thus, we would expect to find novel fungal
GPCRs with no similarities to ones present in other eukaryotic kingdoms. The largest class of M. grisea GPCR-like proteins we identified is the novel PTH11-related class. It is
interesting that we only found homologs of PTH11 in fungi
belonging to subphylum Pezizomycotina within the
Ascomycota (this subphylum has an estimated divergence
date of 1,140 Mya). None was found in fungi belonging to
other subphyla in Ascomycota or Basidiomycota, estimated to
have diverged from each other 1,210 Mya. This indicates that
these proteins are extremely ancient in origin, having possibly evolved to serve specialized functions in a specific subgroup of fungi. They are either unique to this fungal group or
have evolved sufficiently to be unrecognizable.

reports

PTH11-related proteins share a number of characteristics
diagnostic of GPCRs and define a new class of GPCR-like proteins. The predicted membrane topology suggests a sevenspan protein with an amino terminus outside the cell, that
could respond to extracellular signals, and a cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal domain that could interact with G proteins. All
the PTH11-related proteins shared conserved residues within
the membrane spans, as observed in other GPCRs classes [8].
A subclass of the PTH11 receptors showed another characteristic that is seen in a few classes of human GPCRs: they have
an amino-terminal cysteine-rich EGF-like CFEM domain.
The animal secretin receptors are characterized by six conserved cysteines at the amino terminus, with cysteine bridges
implicated in ligand binding. Some of the adhesion receptors
have cysteine rich-EGF-like domains at their amino termini
[6,8]. CFEM-domain-containing proteins, which are smaller

in size and lack the seven transmembrane regions, may interact with the CFEM-containing GPCR-like proteins (Additional data file 3 and [29]). The CFEM-containing proteins
have a signal peptide and/or a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI) anchor. Thus they are either secreted from the cell or
are anchored to the cell membrane. They may be similar to
the odorant-binding proteins, which also have cysteine-rich
domains and have been proposed to interact with odorantGPCRs [32].

ways. We searched the proteome of M. grisea for GPCR-like
proteins and identified a total of 76 sequences (Table 1). This
is the largest number of GPCR candidates identified for any
fungal species. The identified proteins in M. grisea include
homologs of known fungal receptors and a few other eukaryotic receptors. Putative orthologs of fungal STE2- and STE3like pheromone receptors required for the mating responses
in yeast were identified. A homolog of GPR1, which is
involved in pseudohyphal differentiation in S. cerevisiae, and
two proteins that share similarities with STM1 from S. pombe
were also found [11,13,16]. Six proteins shared similarities
with cAMP receptors from Dictyostelium. In Dictyostelium
the cAMP receptors are involved in establishing polarity during chemotaxis [3]. All the above M. grisea proteins can be
annotated as putative GPCRs on the basis of homology to
known receptors. It is likely that they respond to similar ligands, such as pheromones, nutrients and cAMP (Table 1).
Response to fungal mating pheromones and the existence of
pheromone receptors in M. grisea was first suggested by the
observation that M. grisea responded to S. cerevisiae pheromones in a mating-type-specific manner [22]. Intracellular
cAMP, produced by adenylate cyclase, is a critical factor regulating appressorium development in M. grisea. Lee and
Dean have found that the fungus will respond to exogenously
added cAMP by development of appressoria, although the
concentrations required are high [31]. They noted that the cell
wall and cell membrane should be relatively impermeable to
cAMP, and thus any responses to extracellular cAMP will be
due to cAMP receptors. Further research will be required to
learn about the mechanism of perception of exogenous cAMP
and other ligands and their targets within the cell.

Membrane topology of M. grisea GPCR-like proteins
Membrane topology of M. grisea GPCR-like proteins. The figure shows representative examples from different classes with domains that are conserved
with respect to other receptors of the same class. Known Pfam domains or domains conserved between the M. grisea protein and other members of the
class, as shown in Figure 2, are shaded in black. The amino-acid residue numbers that mark the boundaries of these domains are given. The location of the
domains on the membrane topology shown for the M. grisea protein is the same for other proteins that share these domains. For GPR1-related proteins,
sequence similarity was limited to the membrane-spanning regions and MG00532.4 had sequence similarity with other animal GPCRs between the third
and the fifth membrane-spanning regions (not shown in figure).

except a pair of cAMP-receptor-related proteins, occurs in
close proximity. A paralogous pair, MG07553.4 and
MG07565.4, occurs close together on linkage group III, indicating that these genes may have arisen as a result of
duplication. We blasted these sequences against each other
and observed that they show 30% identity with an E-value of
7e-54. This suggests that even if these genes are a result of
duplication, they have diverged sufficiently and are not incorrect duplicate predictions of the same gene due to sequencing
or assembly errors. Both these genes contain the CFEM
domain and also occur in the same clade on the phylogenetic
tree (Figure 1). Another pair of CFEM-containing proteins is
located in close proximity (LGI, group 1). The above examples
of relative expansions within the PTH11-related proteins, as
compared to N. crassa, are an indication that gene duplica-

tion may still be occurring in M. grisea. In N. crassa it is
believed that because of the phenomenon of repeat induced
point mutations (RIP), gene duplications are not maintained
[17]. There is evidence of RIP in M. grisea, but the present
study provides an example that has escaped the RIP process
[34]. Other possibilities are that these genes duplicated
before the evolution of RIP or have escaped RIP because M.
grisea rarely undergoes meiosis in the wild.

Regulation of the activity of GPCR-like proteins by
differential expression and interaction with different
signal transducers
Differential expression and interaction with different signal
transducers could be a way to regulate specific signaling pathways. Results from genome-wide microarray experiments

suggest different patterns of expression for the GPCR-like
receptors during growth and development (T.K. Mitchell and
R.A.D, unpublished work). Representation of some of the
GPCR-like receptors in the fungal ESTs and microarray
experiments suggests that most of these genes are expressed
(Table 1). In addition to differential regulation of the GPCRlike proteins, their interaction with different G proteins could
channel various signals to different pathways. As well as the
well studied interactions with G proteins, it has been proposed that the seven-span receptors may also interact with
other signal transducers and receptor-interacting proteins to
transmit the signal to different cellular pathways.

Genomax (Informax (now Invitrogen)).

Conclusion

Alignments and phylogenetic relationships between
the predicted GPCR sequences
The alignment of sequences within related classes in Figure 2
was done using T_Coffee and minor editing as per results
from the BLAST alignments was done using GenDoc [39]. For
phylogenetic analysis, the conserved PTH11-domain that
spans the membrane-spanning regions was used. Sequences
were aligned using ClustalW version 1.81 [40]. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using PAUP by both neighbor-joining and parsimony methods followed by bootstrap analysis
(100 bootstrap replications). A tree was also constructed
using the neighbor-joining method implemented in the software package MEGA 2.1 [41]. All methods showed similar
relationships between the proteins.

Known GPCR sequences, including ones present in the
GPCRDB [5], were BLASTed against the predicted M. grisea
proteome to identify homologs in M. grisea [21]. The database containing 7,900 GPCR sequences (updated 28 May
2003) was used as a query in a BLASTP search against the M.
grisea predicted proteins with an E-value limit of 1e-09.
Results from an InterPro scan of the M. grisea proteins were
searched for domains containing the following terms: 'GPCR'
and 'G-protein-coupled receptors' [27]. M. grisea PTH11, a
GPCR-like protein (see Results), was also used in a BLASTP
search against the M. grisea proteome. BLAST and PfamA

GPCR-like sequences were evaluated for seven transmembrane regions by TMPRED, Phobius and TMHMM [35-37].
Default settings were used. In nearly all cases at least two of
the algorithms predicted the seven-span helix topology
(Additional data file 1). A BLASTP search using the sevenspan polypeptide sequences as query against the M. grisea
protein set was also done to identify any other similar members. The set of identified seven-span proteins was then subject to BLASTP analysis against GenBank and Swiss-Prot to
confirm sequence similarity to GPCRs. This exercise also
allowed identification of other members that were similar to
these sequences. The M. grisea seven-span proteins identified as above were used as a query in a BLAST search against
the N. crassa predicted proteins [17] to identify homologs.
The M. grisea and N. crassa proteins were placed into clusters using the blastclust program [38]. All M. grisea and N.
crassa proteins that had at least 30% identity and 80% overlap over the length of the proteins were clustered together.
Members of the same species within a cluster were considered
paralogs. Orthologs were defined as proteins that had bidirectional best BLAST hits. A TBLASTN search using the sevenspan containing sequences as query against the GenBank EST
database was performed to identify any identical matches in
the M. grisea ESTs (or other closely related fungal
sequences). The GPCR-like sequences identified in M. grisea
were used as query in BLASTP searches (cutoff < 1e-09)
against the S. cerevisiae and S. pombe genomes and other
completely sequenced fungal genomes to identify putative
homologs in these species.

reports

The number of classes of GPCR-like proteins identified in the
present study is the largest reported in fungi. Further
research on these receptors will help delineate potentially
novel signaling pathways with which they interact. The new
class of PTH11-related receptors, specific to an Ascomycota
subphylum and relatively numerous in M. grisea, is particularly interesting. PTH11 is an integral membrane protein
localized to the cell membrane and is required for pathogenicity [26]. It is proposed to act upstream of the cAMP pathway
as a receptor that channels signals to this pathway. PTH11
does not have an ortholog in N. crassa. Also, as discussed earlier, only one CFEM-containing seven-span protein is present
in N. crassa compared to 12, including PTH11, in M. grisea. It
remains to be determined whether other members of this
expanded class of PTH11-related proteins are involved in different aspects of pathogenicity. The subphylum Pezizomycotina includes the majority of known ascomycete species,
and includes pathogens and mutualists. Because PTH11related GPCR-like proteins are present in non-pathogens,
many members of this class are likely to be involved in functions not related to pathogenesis. All the seven-span receptors and their characteristic domain signatures we discovered
(Figures 2, 3) will be valuable in the identification and comparative studies of new receptors in the many fungal genomes
being sequenced.
