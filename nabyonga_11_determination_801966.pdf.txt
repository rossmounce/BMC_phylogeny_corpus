Abstract
Background: Mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units - variable number of tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR)
genotyping is a powerful tool for unraveling clonally complex Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains and
detection of transmission patterns. Using MIRU-VNTR, MTB genotypes and their transmission patterns among
patients with new and active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in Kawempe municipality in Kampala, Uganda was
determined.
Results: MIRU-VNTR genotyping was performed by PCR-amplification of 15 MTB-MIRU loci from 113 cultured
specimens from 113 PTB patients (one culture sample per patient). To determine lineages, the genotypes were
entered into the MIRU-VNTRplus database [http://www.miru-vntrplus.org/] as numerical codes corresponding to the
number of alleles at each locus. Ten different lineages were obtained: Uganda II (40% of specimens), Uganda I
(14%), LAM (6%), Delhi/CAS (3%), Haarlem (3%), Beijing (3%), Cameroon (3%), EAI (2%), TUR (2%) and S (1%).
Uganda I and Uganda II were the most predominant genotypes. Genotypes for 29 isolates (26%) did not match
any strain in the database and were considered unique. There was high diversity of MIRU-VNTR genotypes, with a
total of 94 distinct patterns. Thirty four isolates grouped into 15 distinct clusters each with two to four isolates.
Eight households had similar MTB strains for both index and contact cases, indicating possible transmission.
Conclusion: MIRU-VNTR genotyping revealed high MTB strain diversity with low clustering in Kawempe
municipality. The technique has a high discriminatory power for genotyping MTB strains in Uganda.

Background
Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of morbidity and
mortality throughout sub-Saharan Africa, and Uganda
ranks sixteenth among countries with the highest burden of disease [1]. Co-infection with HIV/AIDS and the
emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains have made TB a major
public health problem [2]. The incidence of TB in
Uganda is estimated at 330 cases per 100,000 persons
per year, and this includes both HIV infected and non* Correspondence: moses.joloba@case.edu

HIV infected patients [3]. TB prevalence in Uganda is
believed to be higher than reported due to lack of sufficient healthcare; indeed, many people are not aware that
they are infected with MTB and this has led to low
levels of diagnosis and treatment [4]. Uganda also has
one of the lowest TB cure rates (32%) and high drug
default rate [1], which may lead to an increase in drug
resistance mutations.
Molecular genotyping tools for MTB such as IS6110based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP),
“regions of difference” (RD) analysis, spoligotyping,
MIRU-VNTR, and single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) analysis have become invaluable in TB diagnosis
and investigations of disease transmission dynamics,
outbreaks and phylogenetics [5,6]. Of the MTB

genotyping tools, the gold standard is IS6110-RFLP, a
laborious method that requires large amounts of DNA
per isolate, and has poor inter-laboratory reproducibility
[7]. MIRU-VNTR, a faster genotyping method with discriminatory power higher than that of IS6110 RFLP, has
recently been introduced [7,8]. MIRU-VNTR genotyping
is performed by amplifying a panel of 12, 15 or 24 loci
[9]; genotyping with a panel of 15 loci is best suited for
epidemiologic studies [7,10]. Additionally, MIRU-VNTR
can detect mixed MTB strains in a single sputum sample [7,11]. Due to its portable data format, MIRU-VNTR
can be used as a multi-purpose tool for strain identification using a reference database [2]. However, the choice
of appropriate loci for MIRU-VNTR requires evaluation
in diverse MTB lineages in countries with high TB prevalence [7]. Mixed MTB infections in Ugandan patients
with pulmonary TB (PTB) were recently reported using
MIRU-VNTR [11], but genotypes/strains for the entire
patient population were not determined. In this study,
we aimed to determine the distribution and diversity of
MTB lineages in Kawempe municipality using MIRUVNTR genotyping, and assess the ability of the technique to discriminate the predominant genotypes and
detect transmission in this community.

was performed. The allele calling table in the Supply
protocol [8,17] was used to assign the number of alleles
corresponding to the amplicon sizes. To determine
MTB strain lineages, relatedness or clustering, the
MIRU-VNTR genotypes (see additional file 1) were
matched with reference strains in the MIRU-VNTRplus
database (http://www.miru-vntrplus.org/), using a categorical coefficient of 1 and a distance cut off of < 0.3
that corresponds to a seven locus difference. Then, a
Neighbor Joining dendrogram was constructed from the
strains’ genotypes using the MIRU-VNTRplus online
program, on assumption of different evolutionary rates
(molecular clocks) for MTB MIRU loci [9].
A cluster was defined as two or more patients’ strains
with identical genetic patterns. Clusters were assumed
to have arisen from recent transmission, and the clustering rate was used to determine recent transmission of
MTB [18]. The minimum estimate of the proportion of
TB cases related to recent transmission was calculated
using the formula: (number of clustered patients - number of clusters)/total number of patients [18]. To determine the discriminatory power of MIRU-VNTR for this
patient population, the Hunter Gaston Discriminatory
Index (HGDI) [19] was calculated.

Methods

Results and Discussion

Patients, sample processing and cultures

High strain diversity in Kawempe municipality

This study was approved by the Joint Clinical Research
Centre (JCRC) Institutional Review Board (Kampala,
Uganda) and the University Hospitals Cleveland Institutional Review Board (Cleveland, Ohio). Informed written
consent was obtained from patients who participated.
Sputum samples were collected from patients with at
least one positive culture for MTB, who were previously
enrolled in the Kawempe Community Household Contact Study, an ongoing epidemiological study in Kampala, Uganda, from which several papers have been
published [12-15]. Samples were collected consecutively
from October 2007 through February 2009, from
patients with PTB symptoms who reported not having
received treatment for TB in the preceding month.
Patient demographics, sample processing and cultures,
drug susceptibility testing and DNA extraction are
described in Dickman et al, 2010 [11]. Cultures were
confirmed as MTB by PCR-detection of a 500 bp fragment of the IS6110, which is common in the members
of the MTB complex [16].

Between October 2007 and May 2009, 113 MTB cultures from 113 patients with PTB were genotyped with
MIRU-VNTR using a panel of 15 loci [11]. Ten distinct
strains were identified; EAI, Delhi/CAS, Uganda I,
Uganda II, LAM, Haarlem, S, Beijing, Cameroon and
TUR. Isolates from 29 (26%) patients did not match any
strain in the database and were regarded unique (see
Table 1). These findings agree with a previous study
[20], which found strains of different lineages including
Delhi/CAS, LAM and Beijing in Rubaga municipality,

Uganda, using RD genotyping. Furthermore, in this
study, Uganda I and Uganda II were the predominant
lineages (at 14% and 40% prevalence, respectively), followed by LAM (5%). An earlier study using RD genotyping reported MTB “Uganda genotype” as the
predominant strain in Rubaga municipality [21]. The
Beijing, Dehli/CAS, Haarlem and Cameroon strains
were individually found in only 3% of the patients. One
MDR strain was unique while two with mono-resistance
to isoniazid were of EAI lineage. Another strain with
mono-resistance to streptomycin was unique.
There is high genetic diversity in Kawempe Municipality; the HGDI [19] was 0.996, which is very high and
comparable to that of Mulenga et al (0.988) in Ndola,
Zambia [22], an urban setting in an endemic country
similar to Uganda. The high genetic diversity of MTB
strains in Kawempe community could be a consequence
of reactivation of latent MTB infection, increased
human population/global travel and diversity in host
genetics [23].
MIRU-VNTR patterns

There was high diversity of MIRU-VNTR patterns
among the characterized isolates; a total of 94 distinct

patterns were identified, which included 15 clusters each
with two to four isolates. In total 34 (30%) isolates clustered while 79 (70%) had unique patterns (see Figure 1).
The clustering rate was 17%, implying that the minimum estimate of disease related to recent transmission
was 17% (see methods). This is low considering the high
population density, endemicity, poor housing and HIV/
AIDS prevalence in Kawempe municipality [4], which
are risk factors for TB transmission. Similar to the Casablanca study [18], most disease in this community could
be due to reactivation of MTB infection rather than
recent transmission. Furthermore, the clustering rate
was low in comparison with an earlier study in Rubaga
municipality Kampala, Uganda [24], in which a high
clustering rate was reported using IS6110-RFLP genotyping. The differences in clustering rates between the
current and former study could be attributed to the
high discriminatory power of the 15 loci MIRU-VNTR
genotyping panel (HGDI of 0.996).
If true, the possible impact of the presence of low
transmission rate, and the implication that most disease in this community could be due to reactivation of
MTB infection could be highly influential with regards
to infection control measures and disease management.

Probably in future, treatment of latent MTB infections
should be considered as a control strategy in high
endemic areas as it is in industrialized settings. Nevertheless, TB transmission could still be high in
Kawempe municipality; the fact that this study only
looked at one culture sample per patient, more samples from more households (and more genotyping
methods done on each sample) will be needed for conclusive findings.
Six clusters (2, 5, 6, 9, 12 and 15, see Figure 1), each
with two isolates (12 isolates in total) involved members of the same household, implying possible household transmission. Two clusters (4 and 10, see Figure
1), each with four isolates, involved participants within
the same household and those outside the household
(implying a common strain among them). Seven clusters (1, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14 and 15, see Figure 1), each with
two isolates, were from epidemiologically unlinked participants. Recent transmission of PTB was found in
only 17 patients (15%) who had epidemiologically
linked strains. Overall, 17 households had patients
with similar strains but the corresponding cultures for
10 index cases were missing. Eight households had
similar MTB strains for both index and contact cases,
indicating possible transmission (see Table 2). However, household transmission could be higher than we
are reporting if the index cases for the other contacts
were available.

Conclusion
MIRU-VNTR genotyping revealed low clustering and
high diversity of MTB strains in Kawempe municipality
and confirmed earlier reports that MTB strain “Uganda
genotype” is the predominant lineage in Kampala,
Uganda. MIRU-VNTR typing with a panel of 15 loci is
applicable in a Ugandan setting, and can unravel clonally complex strains into individual strains. A nationwide study to determine the full spectrum of circulating
MTB strains in Uganda will be helpful.
