Abstract
Background: The highly pathogenic H5N1 is a major avian pathogen that crosses species barriers and seriously affects
humans as well as some mammals. It mutates in an intensified manner and is considered a potential candidate for the
possible next pandemic with all the catastrophic consequences.
Methods: Nasal swabs were collected from donkeys suffered from respiratory distress. The virus was isolated from the
pooled nasal swabs in specific pathogen free embryonated chicken eggs (SPF-ECE). Reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing of both haemagglutingin and neuraminidase were performed. H5
seroconversion was screened using haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay on 105 donkey serum samples.
Results: We demonstrated that H5N1 jumped from poultry to another mammalian host; donkeys. Phylogenetic
analysis showed that the virus clustered within the lineage of H5N1 from Egypt, closely related to 2009 isolates. It
harboured few genetic changes compared to the closely related viruses from avian and humans. The neuraminidase
lacks oseltamivir resistant mutations. Interestingly, HI screening for antibodies to H5 haemagglutinins in donkeys
revealed high exposure rate.
Conclusions: These findings extend the host range of the H5N1 influenza virus, possess implications for influenza virus
epidemiology and highlight the need for the systematic surveillance of H5N1 in animals in the vicinity of backyard
poultry units especially in endemic areas.
Background
Influenza A viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae and have been isolated from a variety of different species. Further subtyping of influenza A viruses is based on
antigenic differences between the two surface glycoproteins haemagglutinin (H1-H16) and neuraminidase (N1N9) of the influenza A viruses [1,2]. The HA mediates the
attachment of the virus to sialic-acid-containing receptors on the host cell surface, as well as the fusion of the
virus envelope with the cellular membrane [3,4]. The
specificity of the HA towards these molecules differs.
Avian and equine influenza viruses preferentially bind the
sialic acid α-2,3-galactose (SAα2,3Gal) linkage, while
human influenza viruses preferentially bind the
SAα2,6Gal linkage [5-7]. The highly pathogenic avian
influenza virus H5N1 (HPAIV- H5N1) represents an

important poultry pathogen and a major havoc to the
poultry industry. Furthermore, HPAIV H5N1 infections
in poultry constitute a threat to mammals including
humans. Apart from humans, the natural infections of
H5N1 influenza A have been reported in several mammalian species including domestic cats [8], tigers and
leopards [9], dogs [10], pigs [11] and stone marten [12].
Experimentally, H5N1 has also been able to infect mice
[13], ferrets [14], monkeys [15] and cattle [16]. Infections
in either experimental or naturally infected hosts have
been fatal except for pigs and cattle where mild to subclinical infections have been detected [11,16]. No naturally occurring cases of H5N1 HPAI have been reported
in horses or other members of the Perissodactyla order
nor have any experimental studies been published [17].
An equine influenza virus;H3N8 with avian gene pool has
been isolated emphasizing that equines may be susceptible to avian influenza viruses of the H3N8 subtype[18]
and possibly others. The family Equidae and in particular
donkeys may be of great importance in certain endemic

countries like Egypt where they are commonly housed
together with poultry. Long term endemic influenza virus
infections in poultry increase exposure risks to surrounding humans and other mammals and in turn, create
opportunities for the emergence of human-adapted
strains with pandemic potential [19,20]. Since 2006,
H5N1 influenza A virus has been endemic in Egypt producing great economic losses and most importantly hitting humans hard with high case fatality rate; 34/109
(WHO; http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/
country/cases_table_2010_04_09/en/index.html).
Here we report the isolation of HPAI H5N1 from donkeys living in contact with diseased birds and demonstrate the presence of H5 seropositive ones in the
neighbouring areas.

Methods
Virus isolation

Nasal swabs were collected from three infected animals
from Aborady village, El-Wasta locality, Beni-Suef Gover-

norate. Each swab was placed in a tube containing 0.5 ml
sterile normal saline containing gentamicin sulfate solution (50 mg/ml). The swab tip was cut off in the saline
and the tubes were immediately transported to the lab for
testing in an ice box to be processed using a routine
method. Infected materials were pooled, centrifuged at
500 x g for 10 min. and then inoculated into the allantoic
cavity of five, 10-day-SPF-ECE (100 μl/egg). Inoculated
embryos were incubated at 37°C for 24-48 h.
Haemagglutination inhibition

One hundred and five serum samples were collected from
apparently healthy donkeys from different localities in the
Beni-Suef Governorate, 4-6 months after the procedure
of virus isolation. Sera were heat inactivated for 30 min at
56°C and 2-fold serial dilutions were performed in 25-μL
volume in 96-well HI plates. Equal volumes of 4HA of H5

antigen
(A/chicken/Egypt/F6/
2007(H5N1)) were added to diluted serum samples then
1% suspension of human erythrocytes were dispensed to

each well [21]. HI titers ≥ 3 log2 were considered positive.
Samples assayed in duplicates and each assay was validated by comparison with positive and negative chicken
and equine control sera as well as back titration of the
used virus dilutions.

Sequence analysis

Amplicons were first subjected to 1% gel electrophoresis
and specific bands were excised and purified using
EzWayTM gel extraction kit (Komabiotech, Korea). Each
purified amplicon was sequenced in both forward and
reverse directions (Macrogen Inc., Korea).

Viral RNA extraction and RT PCR

Viral RNA was extracted from virus containing chorioallantoic membranes (CAM) homogenate by using a SV
Total RNA Isolation System (Promega Corporation,
Madison, Wis.). The sample was processed alone in a
sterile clean room to avoid the possibility of any cross
contamination. One-step RT-PCR amplification for full
length of both NA and HA genes were performed using
Verso™ 1 step RT PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). A
single set of primers was used for NA (For:ATGAATCCAAATCAGAAG,
Rev:TGTCAATGGTGAATGGCAAC) but for HA, four sets of primers flanking
overlapping regions of the full length gene were used
(Primer sequences for HA were ordered according to that
provided by; Laboratory for Molecular and Biological
Characterization of AIV, FLI, Germany).

Phylogenetic Analysis

BLAST analyses were initially performed to establish HA
and NA sequence identities to GenBank accessions [22].
Comparative analyses were performed using the
CLUSTAL W Multiple Sequence Alignment Program,
Mega 3.1. AIV representative sequences used for the
alignments were obtained from the GenBank and EMBL
database. The phylogenetic trees were constructed by
using the neighbour-joining method with Kimura twoparameter distances by using MEGA version 3.1 [23]. The
reliability of internal branches was assessed by 1000 bootstrap replications and p-distance substitution model.

Results and discussion
In this study, we isolated H5N1 form donkeys clinically
affected with moderate respiratory distress including

cough, fever and serous nasal discharge. The course of the
disease was short (72 h) and responsive well after two
shots of streptomycin/penicillin antibiotic therapy and
one shot of antipyretic (Diclofenac sodium) with no
recorded mortalities. The inhibition induced by antibiotic to the possible secondary bacterial invasion, besides
the moderate severity of the H5N1 in donkeys may be
responsible for the recovery of the infected animals without further complications. The disease recoded on 24th
March 2009, 1 wk after an outbreak of H5N1 infection in
poultry in the village, where many donkeys suffered from
the same clinical manifestations in an epidemic manner.
The virus was isolated from a pool of nasal discharge
from three affected animals. It produced haemagglutination only after the 3rd egg passage. RT-PCR was performed to the full length of both NA and HA genes,
where they were sequenced directly after gel purification.
Sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession
numbers; GU371911 and GU371912 for HA and NA
respectively. The HA and NA genes of the investigated
equine isolates revealed that they belonged to (5J), (1J)
lineages respectively (According to the Influenza A Virus
Genotype Tool) [24]. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that
the HA of the equine isolate related to sublineages, A
(A1) (Fig. 1). The equine isolate showed a typical polybasic cleavage motif with the GERRRKKR*GLF consensus
sequence found in clade 2.2 viruses. It also contains
amino acid D403 characteristic to sub-clade 2.2.1 (Fig. 2).

The haemagglutinin gene was found to be closely related
to A/chicken/Egypt/0894-NLQP/2008, A/Egypt/N00605/
2009 and A/chicken/Egypt/092-NLQP/2009 while the
neuraminidase gene of the current strain is closely related
to A/Egypt/N03450/2009 and A/Egypt/N05056/2009.
However, none of these strains were isolated from localities near to Beni-Suef.
The equine isolate has amino acids Q226 and G228 (H3
influenza numbering) denoting the preferential binding

of α-2,3 linkage, typical for the avian and equine viruses
but not human ones [5,25]. This finding demonstrated
that the isolates with avian specific receptor binding
properties can replicate and cause infection in equines.
Different amino-acids that are implicated in receptor
specificity Y98, S136, W153, H183, E190, K193 L194
E216 P221 K222 G225, Q226, S227, G228 (H3 influenza
numbering) were tested [26]. Interestingly 98 (Y to N),
193 (K to R), 216 (E to K) and 221(P to S) which were
found in the examined equine isolate have also been in
many other isolates from the middle east in the flu database which raises a question as to what the impact of such
substitution on HA binding to human receptors is.
Recently, A138V, N186K and S227N mutations were
reported to confer α-2,6-linked sialic acid binding to
H5N1 virus [27-30]. None of such substitutions were
found in the equine isolate. The HA of the human or
avian Egyptian isolates, contains a total of seven potential
N-glycosylation signals whereas the equine isolate contains an additional N-glycosylation (Fig. 2).
In addition, the equine isolate lacks aa S145. This deletion is also present in all other viruses grouped into 2.2
sublineage A1, which also includes sequences from
human H5N1 isolates (Fig. 2). The significance of this
deletion is unknown, but it should be noted that this position is close to a domain modulating receptor interaction.
Interestingly, strains with this deletion appear to evolve
towards a receptor usage that is similar to that of the seasonal human H1N1[31].
Analysis of the NA gene revealed the presence of the
20-amino acid deletion (Fig. 3) as well as the presence of
amino-acid R at position 110 which is characteristic of
clade 2.2 viruses [32]. Three potential N-glycosylation
sites were predicted (Fig. 3). The 228 (N to S) substitution
is also present and indicative to 2.2.1 virus (2009). Four
NA mutations; E119G, H274Y, R292K, and N294S have
been reported to confer resistance to NA inhibitors [33]
but none were detected in the equine isolate.

Speculating that infected animals may mount an antibody response depending on the interval post infection,
we screened H5-specific antibodies 4-6 months after the
initial virus isolation. The H5 specific antibodies were
detected in naturally affected animals. 27 out of 105
(25.71%) of the examined animals were H5 positive with
the highest percentage found in the area where the virus
was isolated (Table 1, Fig. 4).

Conclusion
We did note the incidence of clinical infections of donkeys with HPAIV (H5N1) in disease endemic regions
where the probability of intimate contact between poultry and donkeys is high. Furthermore, H5 seroconversion
by naturally exposed donkeys was evidenced. Although
the disease did not constitute a real threat to donkeys, it
raises the concern of different issues including the route
of transmission to donkeys, whether being from aerosol
exposure of pulverized infected birds droppings or contaminated feeds and water or because of contact with
infected birds. Second, the role of donkeys in spreading
H5N1 virus to birds, humans and other mammals including equines needs to be assessed.
