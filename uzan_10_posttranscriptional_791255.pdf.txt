Post-transcriptional control by bacteriophage T4:
mRNA decay and inhibition of translation initiation
Marc Uzan1, Eric S Miller2*

Abstract
Over 50 years of biological research with bacteriophage T4 includes notable discoveries in post-transcriptional
control, including the genetic code, mRNA, and tRNA; the very foundations of molecular biology. In this review we
compile the past 10 - 15 year literature on RNA-protein interactions with T4 and some of its related phages, with
particular focus on advances in mRNA decay and processing, and on translational repression. Binding of T4
proteins RegB, RegA, gp32 and gp43 to their cognate target RNAs has been characterized. For several of these,
further study is needed for an atomic-level perspective, where resolved structures of RNA-protein complexes are
awaiting investigation. Other features of post-transcriptional control are also summarized. These include: RNA
structure at translation initiation regions that either inhibit or promote translation initiation; programmed
translational bypassing, where T4 orchestrates ribosome bypass of a 50 nucleotide mRNA sequence; phage
exclusion systems that involve T4-mediated activation of a latent endoribonuclease (PrrC) and cofactor-assisted
activation of EF-Tu proteolysis (Gol-Lit); and potentially important findings on ADP-ribosylation (by Alt and Mod
enzymes) of ribosome-associated proteins that might broadly impact protein synthesis in the infected cell. Many of
these problems can continue to be addressed with T4, whereas the growing database of T4-related phage
genome sequences provides new resources and potentially new phage-host systems to extend the work into a
broader biological, evolutionary context.
Introduction
The temporal ordering of bacteriophage T4 development is assured, in great part, by the cascade activation
of three different classes of promoters (see [1,2] in this
series). However, control of phage development is also
exercised at the post-transcriptional level, in particular
by mechanisms of mRNA destabilization and translation
inhibition [see earlier reviews [3-6]]. In this review we
detail advances in understanding these processes, and
summarize some of the other posttranscriptional processes that occur in T4-infected cells.
Posttranscriptional control by mRNA decay
Endoribonuclease RegB and its role in inactivating phage
early mRNAs

The end of the early period, 5 minutes after infection at
30°C, is marked by a strong decline in the synthesis of
many early proteins. This inhibition is due to the abrupt

shut-down of the early promoters by a mechanism that
is not completely understood [7,8]. In addition, the
phage-encoded RegB endoribonuclease (T4 regB gene)
functionally inactivates many early transcripts and expedites their degradation. As described below, this role of
RegB is accomplished in part, with the cooperation of
the host endoribonucleases RNase E and RNase G and
the T4 polynucleotide kinase, PNK.
The T4 RegB RNase exhibits unique properties. It
generates cuts in the middle of GGAG/U sequences
located in the intergenic regions of early genes, mostly
in translation initiation regions. In fact, the GGAG
motif is one of the most frequent Shine-Dalgarno
sequences encountered in T4. Some efficient RegB cuts
have also been detected at GGAG/U within coding
sequences. RegB cleavages can be detected very soon
after infection, earlier than 45 seconds at 30°C [5,9-14].
The RegB endonuclease requires a co-factor to act
efficiently. When assayed in vitro, RegB activity is extremely low but can be stimulated up to 100-fold by the
ribosomal protein S1, depending on the RNA substrate
[9,15,16].

Functional inactivation of mRNA by RegB

The consequence of RegB cleavage within translation
initiation regions is the functional inactivation of the
transcripts. The synthesis of a number of early proteins
starts immediately after infection and reaches a maximum in four minutes before declining abruptly thereafter. In regB mutant infections, several of these early
proteins continue to be synthesized for a longer time,
resulting in twice the accumulation as compared to
when RegB is functional. The abrupt arrest of synthesis
of these proteins at ~4 min postinfection with wild-type
phage results both from the sudden inhibition of early
transcription and the functional inactivation of mRNA
targets by RegB. However, in addition to down-regulating the translation of many early T4 genes RegBmediated mRNA processing stimulates the synthesis of
a few middle proteins, such as the phage-induced DNA
polymerase, encoded by T4 gene 43 [11,12].
RegB accelerates early mRNA breakdown

RegB accelerates the degradation of most early, but not
middle or late mRNAs. Indeed, bulk early mRNA is stabilized about 3-fold in a regB mutant compared to wildtype infection. After ~3 min post-infection, mRNAs
decay with a constant half-life of about 8 minutes for
the remainder of the growth period at 30°C, irrespective
of the presence or the absence of a functional RegB
nuclease [11]. The host RNase E plays an important role
in T4 mRNA degradation throughout phage development [17]. Total T4 RNA synthesized during the first
two minutes of infection of the temperature-sensitive
rne host mutant is stabilized 3-fold at non-permissive
temperatures. When both genes, regB and rne, are mutationally inactivated, bulk early T4 mRNA is stabilized 8
to 10-fold (half-life of 50 min at 43°C), showing that
both T4 RegB and host RNase E endonucleases are
major actors in T4 early mRNA turnover (B. Sanson &
M. Uzan, unpublished results).
RegB could accelerate mRNA decay by increasing the
number of entry sites for one or the other of the two
host 3’ exoribonucleases, RNase II and RNase R, which
can attack the mRNA from the 3’-phosphate terminus
left after RegB cleavage. An alternative pathway was suggested by the finding that some endonucleolytic cleavages within A-rich sequences depend upon RegB
primary cuts a short distance upstream. This was interpreted as meaning that RegB triggers a degradation
pathway that involves a cascade of endonucleolytic cuts
in the 5’ to 3’ orientation [12]. The host endoribonucleases, RNase G and RNase E, are responsible for cutting at secondary sites, with RNase G playing a major
role [14]. This finding appeared paradoxical since these
two endonucleases have a marked preference for RNA
substrates bearing a monophosphate at their 5’ extremities [18-20], while RegB produces 5’-hydroxyl RNA

termini. Therefore, we suspected that T4 infection
induced an activity able to phosphorylate the 5’-OH left
by RegB, and the best candidate for filling this function
is the phage-encoded 5’ polynucleotide kinase/3’ phosphatase (PNK). This enzyme catalyzes both the phosphorylation of 5’-hydroxyl polynucleotide termini and
the hydrolysis of 3’-phosphomonoesters and 2’:3’-cyclic
phosphodiesters. Indeed, Durand et al. (2008; unpublished data) showed that the secondary cleavages are
abolished in an infection with a phage that carries a
deletion of the pseT gene, encoding PNK. In addition,
many cleavages detected over a distance of 200 nucleotides downstream of the initial RegB cut (mostly generated by RNase E and a few by RNase G), disappear or
are strongly weakened in the PNK mutant infection.
The availability of a mutant affected only in the phosphatase activity (pseT1) made it possible to show that
the phosphatase activity of PNK also contributes to
mRNA destabilization from the 3’ terminus. This presumably occurs through the conversion of 3’-phosphate
into 3’-hydroxyl termini, making RNAs better substrates
for polynucleotide phosphorylase, the only host 3’ exoribonuclease that requires a 3’-hydroxyl terminus to act
efficiently. The total inactivation of PNK increases the
stability of some RegB-processed transcripts (Durand
et al. 2008, unpublished data). Thus, both the kinase
and phosphatase activities of PNK control the degradation of some RegB-processed transcripts from the 5’ and
the 3’ extremities, respectively. This shows that the status of the 5’ and 3’ RNA extremities plays a major role
in mRNA degradation (see also [21]). This was the first
time a direct role was ascribed to T4 PNK in the utilization of phage mRNAs. In bacteriophage T4, as in other
phages and bacteria where this enzyme is found, PNK is
involved in tRNA repair, together with the RNA ligase,
in response to cleavage catalyzed by host enzymes
[22,23] (and see below). Durand’s finding should prompt
one to consider that, in addition to a role in RNA
repair, prokaryotic PNKs might participate in the regulation of mRNA degradation.
The data presented above show that RNase G, a paralogue of RNase E in E. coli, participates in the processing and decay of several phage transcripts [14] (Durand
et al. 2008, unpublished data). Nevertheless, it seems
clear that it does not have the same general effect on
phage mRNA as RNase E. The plating efficiency of T4
is reduced only by 30% on a strain deficient in RNase G
(rng::Tn5) relative to a wild-type strain (Durand et al.
2008, unpublished data).
The RegB/S1 target site

It has been obvious since the initial discovery of RegB
activity that not all intergenic GGAG sequences are
cleaved by this RNase [13,24], suggesting that the motif
is necessary but not sufficient for cleavage. RNA

secondary structure protects against cleavage and several
phage mRNAs that carry an intergenic GGAG/U motif
are resistant to the nuclease, including a few early, most
middle and all late transcripts [11]. These GGAG-containing mRNAs are not substrates of the enzyme either
in vitro or in vivo [11].
A SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment; [25]) experiment, based on the selection
of RNA molecules cleaved by RegB in the presence of
the ribosomal protein S1, led to the selection of RNA
molecules that all contained the GGAG tetranucleotide
[26] and no other conserved sequence or structural
motif. However, in most cases, the GGAG sequence was
found in the 5’ portion of the randomized region, suggesting that the nucleotide composition 3’ to this conserved motif plays a role. More recently, by using
classical molecular genetic techniques, Durand et al. [9]
showed that this was indeed the case. The strong intergenic RegB cleavage sites share the following consensus:
GG*AGRAYARAA, where R is a purine (often an A,
leading to an A-rich sequence 3’ to the very conserved
GGAG motif) and Y a pyrimidine (the star indicates the
site of cleavage) [9]. This unusually long nuclease recognition motif is reminiscent of cleavage sites for some
mammalian endoribonucleases that function with auxiliary factors. One possible model assumes that the auxiliary factors bind the long nucleotide sequence and
recruit the endonuclease [27]. Durand et al. [9] provided
evidence that RegB alone recognizes the trinucleotide
GGA, which it cleaves very inefficiently, irrespective of

RegB

its nucleotide sequence context, and that stimulation of
the cleavage activity by S1 depends on the base composition immediately 3’ to -GGA-.
RegB catalysis and structure

The bacteriophage T4 RegB endoribonuclease is a basic,
153-residue protein. Although its amino acid sequence
is unrelated to any other known RNase, it was shown to
be a cyclizing ribonuclease of the Barnase family, producing 5’-hydroxyl and cyclic 2’,3’-phosphodiester termini,
with two histidines (in positions 48 and 68) as potent
catalytic residues [28].
NMR was used to solve the structure of RegB and to
map its interactions with two RNA substrates. Despite
the absence of any sequence homology and a different
organization of the active site residues, RegB shares
structural similarities with two E. coli ribonucleases of
the toxin/antitoxin family: YoeB and RelE [29]. YoeB and
RelE are involved in the inactivation of mRNA translated
under nutritional stress conditions [30,31]. Interestingly,
like RegB, RelE, and in some cases YoeB recognize triplets on mRNAs, which they cleave between the second
and third nucleotides. It has been proposed that RegB,
RelE and YoeB are members of a newly recognized structural and functional family of ribonucleases specialized in
mRNA inactivation within the ribosome [29] (Figure 1).
How does S1 activate the RegB cleavage reaction?

The E. coli S1 ribosomal protein is an RNA-binding protein required for the translation of virtually all the cellular mRNAs [32]. It contains six homologous regions,
each of about 70 amino acids, called S1 modules (or

domains) connected by short linkers. S1 binds to ribosomes through its two N-terminal domains (modules
1-2) while mRNAs interact with the C-terminal domain
made of the four other modules (3-4-5-6) [33]. S1-like
modules are found in many proteins involved in the
metabolism of RNA throughout evolution. The structure
of these modules, (based on studies of the E. coli S1 protein itself as well as RNase E and PNPase), are predicted
to belong to the OB-fold family [34-38].
The modules required in RegB activation have been
identified. The C-terminal domain of S1 (including
modules 3-4-5-6) stimulates the RegB reaction to the
same extent as the full-length protein. Depending on
the substrate, domain 6 can be removed without affecting the efficacy of the reaction. The smallest domain
combination able to stimulate the cleavage reaction significantly is the bi-module 4-5 [9,39]. Interestingly,
small angle X-ray scattering studies performed on the
tri-module 3-4-5 showed that the two adjacent domains
4 and 5 are tightly associated, forming a rigid rod, while
domain 3 has no or only a weak interaction with the
others. This suggests that the S1 domains 4 and 5 cooperate to form an RNA binding surface able to interact
with the nucleotides of RegB target sites. Module 3
could help stabilize the interaction with the RNA [34].
The 3’ A-rich sequence that characterizes strong RegB
sites (see above) plays a role in the mechanism of stimulation by S1. Indeed, directed mutagenesis experiments
showed that the stimulation of RegB cleavage by S1
depends on nucleotides immediately 3’ to the totally
conserved GGA triplet. The closer the sequence is to
the consensus shown above, the greater the stimulation
by S1 [9]. The affinity of S1 for the A-rich sequence is
not better than for any other RNA sequence (S. Durand
and M. Uzan, unpublished data); suggesting that the
function of this sequence is not simply to recruit S1
locally. Rather, specific interactions of S1 with the conserved sequence might make the G-A covalent bond
more accessible to RegB. In support of this view, RegB
alone (without S1) is able to perform efficient and specific cleavage in a small RNA carrying the GGAG
sequence, provided the GGA triplet is unpaired and the
fourth G nucleotide of the motif is partly constrained
[15]. The RegB protein shows very weak affinity for its
substrates [26,28] and in fact, no RegB-RNA complex
can be visualized by gel shift experiments. However, in
the presence of S1, RegB-RNA-S1 ternary complexes
can form, suggesting that the first step in the S1 activation pathway involves S1 interaction with the RNA (S.
Durand and M. Uzan, unpublished observations). Taken
together, these observations suggest that through its
interaction with the A-rich sequence 3’ to the cleavage
site, the S1 protein promotes a local constraint on the
RNA, facilitating the association or reactivity of RegB.

As RegB is easily inhibited by RNA secondary structures, one possibility was that S1 stimulates RegB
through its RNA unwinding ability [40,41]. However,
Lebars et al. [15] provided evidence that does not support this hypothesis.
Whether S1 participates in the RegB reaction as a free
protein or in association with the ribosome or other
partners in vivo remains to be determined. However, the
structural and mechanistic analogy of RegB to the two
E. coli RNase toxins, YoeB and RelE [29], which depend
on translating ribosomes for activity [30], and the efficiency of RegB cleavage in vivo very shortly after infection [13], favor the likelihood of ribosomes participating
in RegB processing of mRNAs in vivo.
Regulation and distribution of the regB gene

The regB gene is transcribed from a typical early promoter that is turned off two to three minutes after infection. The regB gene is also regulated at the posttranscriptional level, suggesting that the production of
this nuclease must be tightly regulated. Indeed, RegB
efficiently cleaves its own transcript in the SD sequence,
indicating that RegB controls its own synthesis. Three
other cleavages of weaker efficiency occur in the regB
coding sequence, which probably contribute to regB
mRNA breakdown [10].
Despite the fact that the RegB nuclease seems dispensable for T4 growth, the regB gene is widely distributed
among T4-related phages. The regB sequence was determined from 35 different T4-related phages. Thirty-two
of these showed striking sequence conservation, while
three other sequences (from RB69, TuIa and RB49)
diverged significantly. As in T4, the SD sequence of
these regB genes is GGAG, with only one case (RB49) of
GGAU. When experimentally tested, this sequence was
always found to be cleaved by RegB in vivo, suggesting
that translational auto-control of regB is conserved in
T4-related phages [42].
Mutants of regB are viable on laboratory E. coli
strains, although their plaques are slightly smaller in
minimal medium than those of the wild-type phage.
Also, T4 regB mutants form minute plaques on the hospital E. coli strain CTr5x, with a plating efficiency of
one third that on classical laboratory strains (M. Uzan,
unpublished data).
What is the role of RegB in T4 development?

Early transcripts are synthesized in abundance immediately after infection, reflecting the exceptional strength
of most T4 early promoters. In fact, effective promoter
competition for RNA polymerase can be considered one
of the first mechanisms leading to shut-off of host gene
transcription. Abundant and stable phage early transcripts would compete for translation with the subsequently made middle and late transcripts. Therefore, a
specific mechanism leading to early mRNA inactivation

Uzan and Miller Virology Journal 2010, 7:360
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/360

and increased rate of degradation should free the translation apparatus more rapidly and facilitate the transition between early and later phases of T4 gene
expression [5]. Functional mRNA endonucleolytic inactivation is certainly a faster means to arrest ongoing
translation and rapidly re-orient gene expression in
response to changes in growth conditions or the stage
of development. In this regard, it is striking that the two
toxin endoribonucleases, RelE and YoeB, to which RegB
shows strong structural similarities (Figure 1) [29], also
allow swift inactivation of translated mRNAs in response
to nutritional stress.
The finding that RegB shares structural and functional
similarities with other toxin RNases that have antitoxin
partners raises the possibility that an anti-RegB partner
might be encoded by T4. On the other hand, RegB
might not require an antitoxin to block its activity since
its in vivo targets disappear through mRNA decay
shortly after it acts in the infected cell.
T4 Dmd and E. coli RNase LS antagonism
T4 Dmd controls the stability of middle and late mRNAs

The T4 early dmd gene (discrimination of messages for
degradation) encodes a protein that controls middle and
late mRNA stability. Indeed, an amber mutation in dmd
leads to strong inhibition of phage development. Protein
synthesis is normal until the beginning of the middle
period and collapses thereafter. A number of endonucleolytic cleavages can be detected in middle and late
transcripts, which are not present in wild-type phage
infection. Consistent with this observation, the accumulation of these RNA species drops dramatically and the
chemical and functional half-lives of several middle and
late transcripts were shown to be shortened [43-46].
The host RNA chaperone, Hfq, seems to enhance the
deleterious effect of the dmd mutation [47]. These data
strongly suggest that the arrest of protein synthesis in
T4 dmd mutants is the consequence of mRNA destabilization and that the function of the Dmd protein is to
inhibit an endoribonuclease that targets middle and late
transcripts.
The endoribonuclease responsible for middle and late
mRNA destabilization in the dmd mutant is of host origin as shown by the fact that a late mRNA (soc) produced from a plasmid in uninfected bacteria undergoes
the same cleavages as those observed after infection by a
dmd mutant phage [43,48]. Yonesaki’s group further
showed that this RNase activity depends on a new
endonuclease, RNase LS, for late gene silencing in T4.
Several E. coli mutants able to support the growth of a
dmd mutant phage were isolated, among which, two
very efficiently reversed the dmd phenotype. Both mutations were mapped within the ORF yfjN, which was
renamed rnlA [44,45,48].

Biochemical characterization of RNase LS

Purified his-tagged RnlA protein cleaves the late soc
transcript in vitro at only one site among the three
usually observed in vivo after infection with dmd mutant
phage. This cleavage is inhibited by purified Dmd protein [49]. Thus, RnlA has an RNase activity that
responds directly to Dmd. Whether RnlA has targets in
other T4 mRNAs remains to be determined.
Biochemical experiments showed that RNase LS activity is associated with a large complex whose MW was
estimated to be more than 1,000 kDa. More than 10
proteins participate in the complex. Two of them were
identified: RnlA and triose phosphate isomerase. The
latter is present in stoichiometric amounts relative to
RnlA and binds very tightly to it [45,49]. Interestingly, a
mutation in the gene for triose phosphate isomerase is
able to partially allow the growth of a T4 dmd mutant,
suggesting that RnlA and triose phosphate isomerase
functionally interact. It is unclear whether RNase LS
carries only one RNase activity (presumably that of the
RnlA protein) or more, and if the activity of RnlA is
modulated by other components of the complex.
The multi-protein complex that constitutes RNase LS
is not simply a modification of the host degradosome to
contain the RnlA protein during T4 infection, since the
dmd phenotype is not reversed in infection of an RNase
E host mutant (rneΔ131) unable to assemble the degradosome [48].
The specificity of RNase LS and coupling with translation

The specificity and mode of action of RNase LS are not
yet understood. Most of the ~30 cleavages analyzed in
various middle and late transcripts occur 3’ to a pyrimidine in single-stranded RNA. Also, nucleotides 3’ to the
cleavage site might play a role. Apart from these observations, no sequence or structural motif seems to be
shared by the RNase LS target sites [43,44,50,51].
The presence of ribosomes loaded on the mRNA
seems to be required for some RNase LS sites to be efficiently cut. The ribosomes may be either translating or
pausing at a nonsense codon. In the later case, new cleavage sites by RNase LS appear at some distance (20-25
nucleotides) downstream of the stop codon [44,48,51]. It
has been suggested that ribosomes act through their
RNA unwinding property, maintaining the RNA in a
locally single-stranded conformation. In the absence of
translation, a number of potential RNase LS sites would
be masked by secondary structure [51]. Whether this is
the only role of the ribosome in RNase LS activation is
an open question.
The role of RNase LS in E. coli

A mutation in the E. coli rnlA gene, whether a point
mutation or an insertion, leads to reduction in the size
of colonies on minimum medium, but has no effect on
growth in rich medium. Growth of rnlA mutants is

Uzan and Miller Virology Journal 2010, 7:360
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/360

however dramatically affected in rich medium supplemented with high sodium chloride concentrations, thus
providing a phenotype for rnlA mutants. RNA is stabilized by 30% on average in an rnlA mutant. RNase LS
was shown to participate in the degradation of specific
mRNAs as reflected by the prolonged functional lifetime
of several mRNAs in the rnlA mutant. The rpsO, bla
and cya mRNAs are stabilized 2 to 3-fold, in the rnlA
mutant, while other transcripts are unaffected. The
greater stability of cya mRNA (adenylate cyclase) in an
rnlA mutant might indirectly account for the sensitivity
of rnlA cells to NaCl [45,52]. In addition to moderately
controlling the decay of some bacterial transcripts, it is
possible that the first function of RNase LS is host
defense against phage propagation and Dmd is a phage
response to overcome the host defense.

degradosome. A viral factor is also involved, since a
phage carrying the Δtk2 deletion that removes an 11.3
kbp region of the T4 genome, from the tk gene to ORF
nrdC.2, loses the ability to destabilize host transcripts.
The gene implicated has not yet been identified [61].
There is certainly an advantage for a virulent phage to
accelerate host mRNA degradation immediately after
infection, as this provides ribonucleotides for nucleic
acid synthesis, frees the translation apparatus for viral
mRNAs, and facilitates the transition from host to
phage gene expression.
A list of the several endoribonucleases and other
enzymes involved in mRNA degradation and modification during T4 infection is presented in Table 1.

Inhibition of translation initiation
RegA translational repression

Other activities implicated in RNA decay during T4
infection

The E. coli poly(A) polymerase (PAP), encoded by the
pcnB gene, adds poly(A) tails to the 3’ ends of E. coli
mRNAs and contributes to the destabilization of transcripts [53]. T4 mRNAs are probably not polyadenylated. Indeed, it has been found that after infection with
the closely related bacteriophage T2, host poly(A) polymerase activity is inhibited [54]. Also, no poly(A) extension could be detected at the 3’ end of the soc and uvsY
transcripts after infection with T4 [55], suggesting that
bacteriophage T4 infection also leads to PAP inhibition.
This could, for example, occur through ADP-ribosylation of the protein.
Growth of bacteriophage T4 on an E. coli strain carrying the rneΔ131 mutation, which is unable to assemble
the RNA degradosome, is unchanged relative to infection of a wild-type strain [48] (also, S. Durand and
M. Uzan, unpublished data). However, the rneΔ131
mutation has no effect on the growth of E. coli either,
despite affecting the stability of several individual transcripts [56-59]. Therefore, the question of whether the
degradosome plays a role in the turnover of some T4
mRNAs or is modified after infection remains open.
Similarly, whether the host RNA pyrophosphohydrolase,
RppH [21,60] is implicated in T4 mRNA turnover has
not yet been determined.
Infection with bacteriophage T4 expedites host mRNA
degradation. The two long-lived E. coli mRNAs, lpp and
ompA, are dramatically destabilized after infection with
T4. The host endonucleases, RNases E and G, are
responsible for this increased rate of degradation [61].
Phage-induced host mRNA destabilization requires the
degradosome. Indeed, the lpp mRNA is not destabilized
after infection of a strain that carries a nonsense mutation in the middle of the E. coli rne gene (encoding
RNase E), leading to a protein unable to assemble the

Inhibition of middle transcription, some 12-15 minutes
post-infection at 30°C, is concomitant with the strong activation of late transcription [62]. This is the consequence of
competition among sigma factors and changing the promoter specificity of the modified host RNA polymerase.
Indeed, transcription initiation at T4 late promoters
requires the phage-encoded late s-factor, gp55, which
replaces the major host s70, and the T4-encoded gp33,
which ensures coupling of late transcription with ongoing
viral DNA replication [1,62-64]. Superimposed on this
transcriptional regulation, the translation of a number of
transcripts is inhibited by the RegA translational repressor.
This small, 122 amino acid protein competes with the
ribosome for binding to the translation initiation regions
of approximately 30 mRNAs [65]
RegA protein

The crystal structure of T4 RegA is a homodimer, with
symmetrical pairs of salt bridges between Arg-91 and
Glu-68 and pairs of hydrogen bonds between Thr-92 of
both subunits [66] (Figure 2). The monomer subunit
has an alpha-helical core and two anti-parallel beta
sheet regions. Two of the beta strands in the fourstranded beta sheet region B were identified by Kang
et al. [65] as having amino acid sequences similar to
RNP-1 and RNP-2 that are well characterized RNAbinding motifs. In addition, two pairs of lysines, K7-K8
and K41-K42 are in the same position in the proposed
RegA RNP-1 domain [66] as they occur in the U1A
RNA-binding protein, where they comprise basic “jaws”
that straddle the RNA. However, none of the regA
mutations identified in either T4 or phage RB69 prior to
the availability of the RegA structure affected these

mutant having residues 1 - 109 that bound RNA with
reduced affinity, with 28% of the free energy of binding
attributed to the terminal 10% of the protein [67]. It
was also shown by proteolytic cleavage of free RegA,
and RegA bound to an RNA oligonucleotide (the gene

Figure 2 Crystal structure of T4 RegA. In panel A, the RegA
dimer (pymol rendering of PDB 1REG; [66]) is labeled at relevant
structures discussed in the text. Panel B highlights the likely RNA
binding residues in a helix 1 (K14, T18, R21) and loop residue W81.
Also shown is the F106 residue that cross-links to bound RNA and is

44 operator), that conformational change in RegA upon
RNA binding affected access to the C-terminal region.
The C-terminal region is part of beta sheet region A of
RegA [66], appears to be solvent-exposed, and thus
potentially could interact with RNA in some manner.
However, with the RegA structure available, targeted
substitutions in the protein would reveal that specific
RNA recognition likely occurs in an entirely different
region of the protein.
Structure-guided mutagenesis of RegA was undertaken
to evaluate some of these findings and for understanding the specific interactions for RNA binding. Binding
stoichiometry of RegA:gene 44 RNA complexes, gluteraldehyde cross-linking of RegA, and mutagenesis of
amino acids in the inter-subunit interface showed that
T4 RegA is a dimer in solution (as also revealed in the
crystal structure), but binds RNA as monomer [68].
A 1:1 RNA:RegA monomer stoichiometry was independently shown using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry [69]. Mutagenesis of Arg91 again suggested
that at least some residues in the C-terminal region are
involved in subunit interactions and in RNA recognition
[66-68]; Arg91 appears more relevant for RNA binding,
whereas Thr92 is more relevant for dimerization. Spicer
and colleagues further demonstrated that 19 mutations
substituting amino acids in T4 RegA surface residues of
both beta structures, including residues similar to the
RNP-1 and RNP-2 motifs proposed by Kang et al. [66],
as well as the two paired lysines, had essentially no

affect on RNA binding affinity or on RegA structure
[70]. Together with mutations in helix-A, and interpretation of mutations in T4 and RB69 regA that were isolated prior to the structure determination [71], a
somewhat unique RNA-binding helix-loop groove (or
“pocket”) of RegA was proposed to provide the primary
RNA recognition element for the protein. Modeling of
the 78% conserved phage RB69 RegA protein showed
that it also likely contains this unique RNA binding
structure [72]. Exposed residues on helix-A (i.e., Lys14,
Thr18, Arg21) are conserved and substitutions reduce
RNA binding substantially. Additionally, a conserved
loop Trp81 to Ala81 substitution in both proteins
abolishes RNA binding [72]. Phe106, earlier shown to
crosslink with bound RNA, is positioned in a loop bordering the other end of the helix and further defines the
apparent binding pocket [67,70,72]. Figure 2 summarizes
these findings.
In summary, biochemical and structural studies of T4
and RB69 RegA have led from inferences of possible
motifs in RNA binding to structure guided mutagenesis
revealing a unique protein pocket or groove that, in the
monomer form, accommodates the many different
mRNAs that RegA proteins bind to cause translational
repression. The apparent binding domain and exposed
amino acids are largely conserved in RegA proteins
from diverse phages sequenced to date (Figure 3). As
for gp32 and gp43, a RegA-RNA complex has not been
structurally resolved and additional analysis of RegARNA interactions in the helix-loop groove would be of
interest.
RegA RNA operators

Early genetic and translational repression assays confirmed that RegA binding sites on mRNA overlap the
AUG translation initiation codon, or are located immediately 5’ to the AUG, and occluding the site reduces
formation of the ternary translation initiation complex;
decay of the repressed messages is then enhanced [65].
The lack of clear sequence conservation or secondary
structure to define RegA binding sites in the ~30
mRNAs repressed, prompted use of RNA SELEX with
T4 RegA to capture high-affinity RNA ligands. This
RNA binding site selection was thus performed in the
absence of constraints imposed on the sequence by 30S
ribosome subunits that bind the same region of mRNA
for translation initiation [73]. Emerging from multiple
rounds of SELEX was an RNA consensus sequence of
5’-aaAAUUGUUAUGUAA-3’ that bound RegA with an
apparent Kd of 5 nM (the lower case 5’ bases were
already present in the starting, non-variable regions of
the RNA). The sequence showed no apparent structure
using nuclease or base-modifying chemical probes and
is consistent with earlier observations that biologically
relevant RegA binding sites lack clear RNA secondary

structure. Although the T4 RegA SELEX sequence is
similar to mRNA sequences repressed by RegA (i.e., T4
gene rIIB, AAAAUUAUGUAC; gene 44, AAAUUAUGAUU; dexA, AAAAUUUAAUGUUU), there was no
exact match between it and the repressed T4 messages
[73]. These findings emphasize that T4 RegA binding
sites are A+U rich; include an AUG and a 5’ poly(A)
tract; lack apparent structure; and in general, illustrate
how an RNA binding determinant has evolved for
occurring on many different mRNAs where fMet-tRNA
and the 30S ribosome subunit also bind.
RNA sequences bound by phage RB69 RegA have also
been examined [65,72,74,75]. Translational repression
occurs at RNAs from both phages, although binding
affinities displayed by the two proteins are different in
vivo and in vitro; a hierarchy of early and middle genes
repressed by T4 RegA is also seen with RB69 RegA. For
RB69 RegA, the protein protected a region between the
gene 44 and gene 45 Shine-Dalgarno and AUG, but not
the initiator AUG itself [72]. The protein would still
compete for the same binding site as the ribosome.
Using a stringent but reduced number of selection
cycles, RNA SELEX was performed using immobilized
RB69 RegA and a variable sequence of 14 bases [75].
The selected RB69 RegA RNAs were predominately
5’’AAUAAUAAUAAnA-3’, which also did not contain a
conserved AUG but were clearly A+U rich. As discussed
by Dean et al. [75], a stop codon (i.e, UAA) for an
upstream gene within the ribosome binding site region
of the adjacent downstream gene, may contribute a relevant sequence for RNA recognition by RegA proteins.
All of these findings emphasize the range of RegA
repression efficiencies at different sites, lack of RNA
structure in binding sites, and the variable mRNA
sequences to which the protein binds.
Specific autocontrol of translation: gp32 and gp43

Besides the two general post-transcriptional regulators,
RegA and RegB, the T4 DNA unwinding protein, gp32,
and the DNA polymerase, gp43, both involved in DNA
replication, recombination and repair, autogenously regulate their translation.
Control of gene 32 translation and mRNA degradation

Gene 32 encodes a single-stranded DNA binding protein
(gp32) essential for replication, recombination and
repair of T4 DNA. It appears after a few minutes of
infection, reaches a maximum around the 12-14th minute and declines thereafter. In addition to being temporally regulated at the transcriptional level, gp32 inhibits
its own translation when the protein accumulates in
excess over its primary ligand, single-stranded DNA.
This regulation is achieved through binding of gp32 to a
pseudoknot RNA structure located 5’ in region 67
nucleotides upstream of the gene 32 translation

cooperative binding through an unstructured A+U-rich
sequence (including several UUAA(A) repeats 3’ to the
pseudoknot) that overlaps the ribosome binding site
[3,6,65].
Gp32 is a Zn(II) metalloprotein with three distinct
binding domains [76]. To date, the structure of fulllength gp32 has not been determined, nor has the protein in complex with RNA been structurally examined.

It has been presumed that DNA and RNA are alternative ligands that bind in the same cleft. Although there
is substantial study of gp32 interactions with ssDNA,
and with proteins of the DNA replication apparatus, few
studies have investigated either the RNA pseudoknot in
the mRNA autoregulatory site or the molecular details
of gp32-RNA interactions. NMR analysis of the phage
T2 gene 32 pseudoknot revealed two A-form helices
coaxially stacked, with two loops separating the two

Uzan and Miller Virology Journal 2010, 7:360
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/360

helical structures [77] (Figure 4). A related translational
regulatory structure is present in gene 32 leader mRNA
of the phylogenetically related T4-type phage RB69 [78].
In this case, sequence alignment, chemical- and RNasesensitivity, and gp32-RNA footprinting revealed mRNA
operator similarities and differences that explain overlapping yet distinct RNA-binding properties by the two gene
32 proteins [78]. However, the T4-type coliphage RB49
genome sequence revealed no conserved pseudoknot or
an A+U-rich sequence near the predicted ribosome binding site of its gene 32 mRNA [79]. More thorough study
of translational autocontrol by gp32 in diverse T4-related
phages is needed. To date, the T4-type phage gene 32
RNA pseudoknot may still be the only viral example of
this structure used in autoregulation of translation. The
various biological roles of viral RNA pseudoknots was
well reviewed by Brierley et al. [80].
The gene 32 transcripts are more stable than any
other T4 mRNAs. A half-life of 15 minutes was measured at 30°C and, under derepression conditions (in a
T4 gene 32 mutant infection unable to achieve translation repression), the half-life can reach 30 minutes
[81,82], indicating that translation of the gene 32 mRNA
positively affects its stability. All the gene 32 mRNA
species are processed by RNase E, 71 nucleotides
upstream of the translation initiation codon of the gene
[83,84]. In addition to the cleavage at -71, two other
major cleavages were identified, one far upstream in the
polycistronic transcripts (-1340) and the other at the

Page 10 of 22

end of the coding sequence of gene 32 (+831) [85,86].
The conservation of all three RNase E processing sites
in 5 different T4-related phages, in spite of significant
changes in the organization of the upstream regions,
suggests that these cleavages play an important role in
controlling expression of gene 32 and/or its upstream
genes [86]. The new 3’ ends created by RNase E processing are potential entry sites for the host 3’-5’ exoribonucleases. In fact, portions of the transcript upstream of
the -71 and -1340 cleavage sites were shown to be
rapidly degraded [84,85].
The RNase E cleavage at +831 has no consequences
on the functional decay of the gene 32 mRNA, while it
affects the chemical decay [17]. It is noteworthy that
this RNase E site is very close to the translation termination codon of gene 32. The E. coli ribosomal protein
S15, encoded by the rpsO gene, autogenously regulates
its own translation. The rpsO transcript carries a pseudoknot in its translational operator [87], like the T4 32
mRNA. Also, a strong RNase E cleavage site, involved in
rpsO mRNA decay, lies at the end of the structural
gene, in close proximity of the translation termination
codon. Interestingly, ribosomes were shown to inhibit
this distal RNase E cleavage [88]. On this basis, it is
tempting to suggest that a ribosome that reaches the
end of gene 32 transcript would hinder the accessibility
of the distal RNase E site to RNase E. Thus, gene 32
transcripts that undergo RNase E processing at this site
might be only those that have been already translationally inactivated, e.g., under repression conditions (excess
of gp32 over single stranded DNA). This situation
would promote rapid elimination of the untranslated
gene 32 transcripts.
Autocontrol of gene 43 translation

Figure 4 Gene 32 translational repression site. In Panel A the
leader mRNA for autogenous gp32 binding is shown for RB69, T4
and T2. The important TIR nucleotides are underscored with
asterisks, the base-paired regions of the 5’ pseudoknot are marked
with arrows, and the T4 and RB69 regions bound by gp32 in
protection assays are overlined [78]. Short nucleotide insertions in
RB69 or T2 relative to T4 are in blue. Dashes (gaps) are inserted for
alignment. Panel B is a cartoon-ribbon diagram of the T2 gene 32
pseudoknot diagramed in panel A that was obtained by
multidimensional NMR methods [77]. Two A-form coaxially stacked
stems are apparent. 5’ and 3’ terminal nucleotides are labeled. Jmol
rendering used database entry 2 tpk. Figure was derived and
adapted primarily from data in [77,78].

Like gp32, T4 DNA polymerase (gp43) is an autoregulatory translational repressor protein; it binds an RNA
operator sequence that includes a hairpin about
40 bases upstream of its translation initiation codon and
sequence that overlaps the ribosome binding site [89].
Most T4 gene 43 transcripts are synthesized early during infection and have a half-life of approximately 3 minutes, yet it is these transcripts on which the polymerase
exerts translational repression when not engaged in
DNA replication [65].
gp43 RNA-binding determinants

The structure of the closely related gp43 DNA polymerase of phage RB69 serves as an excellent model for a
DNA polymerases that are conserved across phylogenetic domains [90,91]. Due to the availability of the
RB69 gp43 structure, more recent RNA binding studies
have been conducted using this protein and its RNA
operator.
RB69 operator RNA chemically crosslinks with gp43
in the DNA binding “palm” domain, but other sites and

Uzan and Miller Virology Journal 2010, 7:360
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/360

residues protected from protease when the protein is
bound to specific RNA were distributed across domains
of the polymerase. These numerous affects were attributable to either direct interactions, or conformational
changes induced by RNA binding [92]. As for the gp32RNA interactions, full appreciation of the contacts and
conformational changes during binding of gp43 to its
specific RNA target will require solution or crystal
structure of gp43-RNA complexes.
Gene 43 mRNA autoregulatory site

The gene 43 RNA operator includes an upstream hairpin, but there is no evidence that it forms a pseudoknot
structure like that of the gene 32 binding site. While the
T4 hairpin-loop operator is 18 bases and that of RB69 is
16 bases, the top 10 bases are identical, including
nucleotides in the loop [93]. The -UAAC- loop
sequence of the T4 & RB69 operators were also the predominant bases selected in the first RNA SELEX experiment that used gp43 for RNA binding site
characterization [25]; it will be interesting to see
whether any phage gp43 proteins closely related to the
T4 protein have the SELEX major variant loop sequence
(-CAAC-) in their native, autoregulatory RNA hairpins.
Phage RB49 contains -UAAA- in its RNA loop, and various repression and RNA-protein interaction assays
point to the 3’ AC and AA loop bases as especially relevant for binding by these three phage proteins; however,
some T4-related phages encode gp43 DNA polymerases
that do not autoregulate translation [92-94].

Other T4 post-transcriptional control systems
RNA structure at translation initiation regions

RNA structure influences translation initiation of T4
mRNAs, especially as they target protein binding in
translational repression (i.e., gp32 and gp43 above;
[65,95]). In addition, some T4 mRNAs form intramolecular RNA structures that directly contribute to translation initiation efficiency of the respective mRNAs. Only
a few advances have been made in the last decade on
these cis-acting RNAs, which are briefly summarized
here. We should note that no riboswitch system [96,97]
or small, trans-acting regulatory RNA has been functionally characterized from T4; maybe some of the genome sequences of T4-related phages will suggest good
candidates for these types of RNAs. Two small RNAs,
RNAC and RNAD, are transcribed from the T4 tRNA
region, but their biological roles are unknown [95].
Examples of inhibitory RNA structures at translation
initiation regions include mRNAs encoded by T4 genes
e, soc, 49, and I-TevI [65]. In each case, the Shine-Dalgarno and/or the AUG start codon are sequestered in
an RNA helix that reduces 30S subunit binding in forming the ternary translation initiation complex [98]. The
well-documented case for gene e (T4 lysozyme) is that

Page 11 of 22

early during infection longer transcripts are made that
extend into e and if translated could potentially lead to
premature cell lysis. However, the longer transcripts
clearly form the inhibitory RNA structure [98], reducing
synthesis of lysozyme 100-fold [99] relative to transcripts lacking RNA structure. Transcripts initiated from
either of two T4 late promoters immediately upstream
of the ribosome binding site lack the 5’ portion of the
gene e mRNA inhibitory structure and are well translated. Although there is no additional analysis of the
e mRNA structures, similar leader RNA sequences are
predicted from genome sequences of closely related
T4-type phages, and each has a T4-type late promoters
in upstream region the encodes the 5’ strand of the
RNA structure. Therefore, early translation of these lysis
genes may also be inhibited by intramolecular RNA
structures (Figure 5).
The T4 thymidylate synthase gene (td) contains an
intron, wherein the intron encodes a homing endonuclease, I-TevI [100]. Similar to gene e, early and middle
period transcripts that extend through the td 5’ exon

and into the intron do not yield translated I-TevI
because of the tightly regulated, sequestered ribosome
binding site [101-103]. Recently, Edgell and colleagues
[104] showed that deletion of nucleotides that comprise
the late promoter proximal 5’ portion of the RNA structure leads to increased levels of I-Tev1 throughout
infection that is translated from upstream-initiated early
and middle promoters. In the presence of added thymidine, the mutant phage (ΔHP) showed no reduction in
T4 viability or burst size attributable to increased translation initiation of I-TevI mRNA. However, a series of
phage growth, RT-PCR, and tRNA suppressor assays,
led Gibb and Edgell [104] to conclude that tight regulation of I-TevI translation initiation by the RNA secondary structure increases intron splicing. That is, the
structure reduces ribosome loading and movement
through the intron RNA, thereby promoting structure
formation (P6, P6a and P7) in the intron. Loss of translation inhibition disrupts intron RNA folding and splicing, and prevents proper accumulation of thymidylate
synthase [104]. Similar structures predicted to cause
negative translational regulation in I-TevI RNAs have
been identified in T4-related phages, and also in the
translation initiation regions of phage I-TevII and
I-TevIII homing endonuclease genes [105,106]. Standalone homing endonucleases (not located within an
intron) also have RNA structures that have been shown
(Aeromonas phage Aeh1 mobE; [106]) or implicated (T4
segB; [107]) to reduce translation initiation.
Intramolecular RNA structures in T4 mRNAs also
have been shown to improve translation initiation. Of
particular note are T4 genes 38 and 25 [108]. In these
cases, suboptimal, extended spacing between the ShineDalgarno and AUG start codon is brought to a functional distance by an RNA secondary structure between
the SD and AUG. For gene 38 mRNA, the spacing of 22
nucleotides is reduced to 5 nucleotides with the structure; for gene 25 the structure reduces the spacing from
27 to 11 nucleotides [108]. Mutations in the intervening
sequence that destabilize the structure reduce translation initiation efficiency. More recently, Malys and
Nivinskas [109] used reporter assays of the gene 25 TIR
region fused to lacZ, in conjunction with DMS probing
of the intervening RNA structure, to confirm the “split”
RBS-SD arrangement and its use for effective expression
of gene 25. Phylogenetic evaluations of 38 T4-related
phages revealed that the close T-even phages all have
the intervening RNA structure in the split TIR configuration, but more distant, non-coliform T4-related
phages lack this arrangement (Figure 5). This suggested
an evolutionary history for the gene 25 split TIR, along
with the enhancing, intervening RNA structure, where
the arrangement arose after the close T-even phages
diverged from other members of the phage group [109].

T4 exclusion and the mechanism of bacterial PrrC
anticodon nuclease

T4 mutants defective in polynucleotide kinase (Pnk) or
RNA ligase 1 (Rli1) grow normally on E. coli laboratory
strains, but are restricted on some E. coli hospital strains.
The restrictive hosts are referred to as prr+ for T4 pnkor rli- mutants. T4 intergenic suppressors of the restriction of pnk or rli mutants on prr+ hosts define the T4 stp
locus (see early reports cited [23,110]). The system of
growth restriction results from activation of a host anticodon RNase (ACNase), PrrC, by the phage-encoded Stp
protein. The bacterial PrrC RNase cuts within the
tRNALys anticodon loop, upstream of the wobble nucleotide and causes the arrest of phage protein synthesis and
phage growth. T4 has evolved a tRNA repair mechanism
to escape this restriction by way of the phage-induced
polynucleotide kinase - 3’ phosphatase (pnk gene), which
converts the tRNA 5’-hydroxyl and 3’-phosphate termini
left by PrrC, into 5’-phosphate and 3’-hydroxyl ends. Subsequently, the T4 RNA ligase 1 rejoins the tRNA ends.
Stp, Pnk and Rnl1 are all under the delayed early mode
of expression [23], meaning that restoration of the
cleaved tRNALys takes place early during infection. The
E. coli prrC gene is located within a group of genes that
encode type Ic restriction-modification (R-M) proteins,
EcoprrI, in the order hsdM-hsdS-prrC-hsdR (or
prrABCD). The Hsd enzymes are assembled in a multimeric complex, HsdR2M2S [23,110-112].
Stp alleviates type Ic restriction and activates the tRNALys
ACNase

Although only 26 residues long, the Stp polypeptide is
necessary and sufficient to elicit the tRNALys ACNase
activity and mutations in the stp gene abolish activation
of the ACNase. Expression of Stp protein from a plasmid also elicits ACNase activity in an uninfected prr+
strain [113].
Stp alleviates EcoprrI-mediated DNA restriction, indicating that this protein targets the EcoprrI complex
rather than just PrrC directly. Several observations support this explanation: a) Growth of the lambdoid phage,
HK022, propagated on prr 0 cells, is heavily restricted
upon plating on a prr+ strain; b) Expression of Stp from
a plasmid in prr+ cells alleviates this restriction; c) prr+
cells do not restrict growth of phage HK022 prepared
on a prr + host expressing Stp. This strongly suggests
that Stp inhibits EcoprrI restriction enzyme but does not
affect the modification activity. Also, the fact that
EcoR124I, another type Ic R-M system that does not
include an ACNase, is inhibited by Stp, strongly supports the above conclusion. Stp is specific for type Ic RM systems; it has no effect on the type Ia R-M systems,
EcoKI and EcoBI [113].
The N-proximal 18 amino acids of Stp protein are
probably involved in the interaction with EcoprrI since a

Uzan and Miller Virology Journal 2010, 7:360
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/360

number of missense stp mutants deficient in ACNase
activation have been detected among revertants of T4
pnk- or rli- mutants that are able to grow on the E. coli
prr + host. The majority of these suppressors cluster
between residues 4 and 14 in the N-terminal part of the
Stp polypeptide. In contrast, a deletion of 8 codons
from the C-terminus only moderately decrease the two
activities of Stp. Alignment of Stp sequences from eight
T4-related phages with that of T4 reveals an almost
absolute conservation of the 18 N-terminal residues,
whereas polymorphism is evident in the remainder of
the polypeptide. In most cases, the amino acids important for ACNase activation are also implicated in
EcoprrI inhibition, suggesting some shared features
[113]. We direct the reader to the primary literature by
Kaufmann and colleagues [113] that hypothesizes on the
evolutionary history of Stp in counteracting host DNA
restriction enzymes, while also activating host ACNase.
Interaction of PrrC with EcoprrI and mechanism of ACNase
activation

It appears that PrrC is maintained in a latent, inactive
form, due to its association with the EcoprrI proteins.
Antibodies against the closely related EcoR124I R-M
system co-immunoprecipitate the PrrC protein. Conversely, antiserum against PrrC precipitates the HsdR
(PrrD) protein [114,115].
Activation of latent ACNase in prr + cell extracts
requires both Stp and GTP and is likely accompanied by
GTP hydrolysis since addition of the non-hydrolysable
analogue, GTPgS, is inhibitory. DNA is another positive
effector of ACNase. Indeed, if the cell extract is treated
with DNase I, activation by Stp is abolished. The activating DNA must carry cleavable (unmodified) EcoprrI
restriction sites to be effective in ACNase activation.
This led to the proposal that Stp activates the latent
ACNase when its EcoprrI partner is tethered to EcoprrI
DNA substrates [114-116].
Induction of prrC from a multicopy plasmid elicits
ACNase activity in uninfected E. coli cells or in cultured
mammalian cells [116,117]. This occurs in the absence
of any other prr genes. In E. coli, this core ACNase is
highly labile (t1/2 < 1 minute at 30°C) while the ACNase
found in extracts of prr+ cells is rather stable, indicating
that the association with the Hsd proteins stabilizes
PrrC [115]. In crude cell extracts as well as with a partially purified leaky mutant form of PrrC (more stable
than the wild-type enzyme; see [22]) core ACNase is not
affected by Stp and is indifferent to the presence of
DNA. This suggests that the role of these two effectors
is to alleviate the Hsd masking effect on PrrC [116].
dTTP and other pyrimidine nucleotides, but not GTP or
ATP, stimulate core ACNase activity at physiological
concentrations, most probably by stabilizing the protein.
ATP, GTP and dTTP bind to the NTP-binding domain

Page 13 of 22

of PrrC (see below) [22,116]. Unexpectedly, GTP is inhibitory. The reason why core ACNase does not respond
to GTP like the holoenzyme is unclear. Although this
nucleotide binds PrrC (see below), it is possible that the
GTPase catalytic site becomes active only when PrrC is
associated with the Hsd component. However, it must
be noted that the purified PrrC used in this study bears
a leaky mutation, D222E, which confers a higher stability to the protein and permits its purification. Unfortunately, this mutation lies in the Walker B motif, which
might affect the GTPase activity [22,116].
Several pyrimidine nucleotides are able to activate the
latent ACNase in the absence of Stp, but at concentrations far above those required to protect the core
ACNase or to UV-crosslink with PrrC (see below).
dTTP is the most potent of them [116]. Like for Stp,
the activation by dTTP requires GTP hydrolysis and
EcoprrI DNA substrate. However, unlike Stp, which targets the Hsd complex, dTTP targets PrrC directly. The
physiological meaning of this alternative mode of activation is not clear. It has been interpreted to mean that
ACNase may be mobilized under cellular stress conditions not related to T4 infection. An alternative, but not
exclusive, model assumes that dTTP is an obligatory coactivator working in concert with Stp. Because dTTP
binds PrrC with high affinity, trace amounts of this
nucleotide in crude extracts would be sufficient to allow
latent ACNase activation upon Stp addition. Excess
dTTP would by-pass the requirement for Stp [22].
PrrC structure, domain organization and distribution

The N-proximal two-thirds of the PrrC protein (ca. 265
residues out of 396) harbors a nucleotide-binding site
and is thought to mediate activation of the latent
ACNase (Figure 6). It features motifs that resemble
those found in typical ABC-transporter ATPases: a
somewhat degenerated ABC signature motif, Walker A
(phosphate-loop) and Walker B motifs and an H-motif
that contains a highly conserved His (the linchpin His)
[22]. Mutations in the universally conserved residues of
the Walker A motif of PrrC abolish ACNase activity
[116]. ATP, GTP and dTTP bind PrrC to this region, as
a mutation lying immediately upstream of the ABC signature severely decreases the ability of the protein to
UV-crosslink with all three nucleotides. Because dTTP
activates ACNase by targeting PrrC directly and requires
GTP hydrolysis, the binding sites for the two nucleotides are likely different in PrrC oligomer. GTP and
ATP likely share the same site. The interaction of dTTP
with PrrC departs from that of the two other nucleotides in several respects. Mutations in the N-proximal
Walker A motif, in the ABC signature sequence, or in
the linchpin His do not affect the binding of ATP or
GTP while they abolish dTTP binding to PrrC. Also,
dTTP affinity to PrrC is three orders of magnitude

higher than that of the two other nucleotides. Furthermore, a mild heat inactivation of ACNase has little consequence on ATP or GTP binding but abolishes dTTP
binding. This suggests that the dTTP binding site is distinct and is sensitive to small changes in PrrC structure
[22,116].
The C-terminal third of PrrC is implicated in tRNA
recognition and catalysis. Several missense mutations
affecting ACNase activity are located in close proximity

here (Figure 6). These were selected as mutations conferring the ability to survive the lethal overproduction of
PrrC [118]. Because most of these substitutions are clustered in a short sequence highly conserved in a subset of
the known PrrC homologues (residues 287 to 303)
[22,118,119], the behavior of an 11-residue peptide (residues 284 to 294) was examined for RNA substrate interactions. This peptide forms UV-induced crosslinks with
tRNALys anticodon stem-loop analogs and inhibits the

Uzan and Miller Virology Journal 2010, 7:360
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/360

ACNase activity of PrrC. Introducing certain substitutions in the peptide that are known to inactivate fulllength PrrC, or shortening it by one amino acid from
either end, leads to strong decrease in its ability to inhibit ACNase and to UV-crosslink with the anticodon
stem-loop substrates [119]. Thus, this sequence is likely
a part of the PrrC protein that interacts with the tRNA.
In addition, substitutions in Arg320, Glu324 and His356
that are 100% conserved in all known PrrC homologs
and suspected to participate in the acid-base catalytic
mechanism, completely abolish ACNase activity. Null
mutations in Arg320 and Glu324 can be rescued chemically by small molecules, indicating that the ACNase
deficiency does not arise from a change in the structure
of the protein, but rather from the lack of the correct
amino acid side chain. This is compatible with the
notion that at least two of the three conserved residues
are implicated in catalysis [22].
Orthologues of prrC were found in 19 distantly related
bacteria, all linked to genes for type Ic R-M enzymes.
All of the orthologue proteins share in their N-terminal
domains the NTP-binding site and a sequence of 15
residues called the “PrrC box”. Also, their C-terminal
domains contain the catalytic amino acid triad mentioned above. Thus, the PrrC proteins form a family
whose members are strongly suspected not only to possess anticodon nuclease activity (as shown to be the
case for those encoded by Haemophilus influenzae and
Streptococcus mutans [120]), but also to be regulated
like E. coli PrrC. However, their substrates may vary
since the sequence involved in tRNA recognition varies
among the PrrC proteins [22,119].
ACNase activity co-elutes from a gel filtration column
with a homo-oligomer of ca. 200 kDa, suggesting that
active PrrC could be a tetramer. Glutaraldehyde proteinprotein crosslinking experiments confirm this, as mostly
dimers and tetramers are produced [22]. Klaiman et al.
[119] showed evidence suggesting that the C-terminal
region of PrrC, involved in tRNA recognition, interacts
with the substrate as a parallel dimer. Thus, while the
N-terminal domain of PrrC is expected to associate in a
head-to-tail dimer, by analogy with known structures of
ABC transporter ATPases, the C-terminal region seems
to dimerize in opposite orientation. To account for this
situation, Klaiman et al. [119] proposed a model in
which the PrrC subunits are associated in a unique tetramer conformation. Clearly, additional structural studies are necessary to elucidate the oligomeric structure
of PrrC.
ACNase specificity

Kaufmann and colleagues have shown that the tRNALys
anticodon stem-loop region plays a prominent role in
PrrC recognition: (a) PrrC, when overproduced in cells,
cleaves other tRNAs in addition to tRNA Lys . The

anticodon sequences of all these secondary tRNA substrates share sequence similarities with that of tRNALys
[118]. (b) Expression of PrrC in human HeLa cells elicits
cleavage of intracellular tRNALys3 that shares with the
E. coli tRNALys the same anticodon loop sequence [117].
(c) Most mutations in the tRNALys anticodon sequence
make the resulting tRNAs very poor substrates for
ACNase. One of them, however, (U35 -> C leading to
UCU anticodon) leads to relaxed site specificity as new
cleavages occur upstream and downstream of the usual
cleavage site [121]. (d) A chimeric, unmodified,
tRNAArg1 carrying the UUU lysine anticodon instead of
its own anticodon, is as efficiently cleaved as the unmodified tRNALys [121]. (e) PrrC quite efficiently cleaves a
fragment of the tRNALys encompassing only the anticodon loop and the first 5 base pairs of the associated
stem (17 nucleotides altogether) [122]. (f) Cleavage of
tRNALys that lacks either of the two modifications of the
uridine wobble base (2-thio- and 5-methylaminomethyl)
is severely affected. Interestingly, three substitutions of
PrrC Asp287 (D287Q, D287H and D287N), known to
reduce the efficiency of cleavage of normally modified
E. coli tRNALys, reverse the negative effect of the hypomodifications of the wobble base. This strongly supports
the notion that Asp287 directly contacts the modified
wobble base. Experiments carried out with the anticodon stem-loop (17-mer) as substrates reinforce this conclusion. Indeed, Jiang et al. [122] showed that the
wobble base modification present in the anticodon
stem-loop derived from mammalian tRNALys3 (5-methoxycarbonyl-2-thiouridine instead of 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine) is inhibitory to ACNase activity.
However, D287H PrrC, poorly active on the fully modified E. coli anticodon stem-loop counterpart, overcomes
this inhibitory effect [121,122]. (g) The influence of the
stem stability and of the three different modifications in
these anticodon stem-loop structures was examined in
great detail. The picture that emerges is the following. A
stable stem is inhibitory to ACNase activity. Some
breathing of the duplex seems necessary, possibly to
facilitate conformational changes of the tRNA upon
interaction with PrrC. Also, PrrC seems to favor base
modifications that help stack the anticodon nucleotides
into an A-RNA conformation [122]. Thus, three elements are recognized by PrrC: the anticodon sequence,
the base modifications and base-pairing of the stem.
Although the anticodon stem-loop region of tRNALys
is the predominant element of PrrC specificity, other
sequence and/or structural elements of tRNALys seem to
be involved. This is indicated by the fact that chimeric
tRNAs, other than the tRNA Arg1 , carrying the lysine
anticodon, are not substrates for PrrC. Also, any substitution of the discriminator nucleotide (A73) of the
tRNALys, a major identity element of LysRS that lies in

Uzan and Miller Virology Journal 2010, 7:360
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/360

the acceptor arm, reduces, though moderately, the
ACNase cleavage efficiency. Furthermore, trimming the
3’-terminal ACCA overhang nucleotides has little effect
on ACNase activity but relaxes the cleavage site specificity in a manner similar to the U35 -> C mutation
[121]. These data suggest additional interactions
between PrrC and the acceptor region of tRNALys.
Gathering the data into a model

Taken together, the above data suggest the following
cascade of events. A few minutes after infection of prr+
E. coli cells, the T4-encoded Stp polypeptide binds the
bacterial EcoprrI component and inhibits its DNA
restriction activity (Figure 6). This modifies the EcoprrI/
PrrC interaction, inducing a change in PrrC conformation that unmasks ACNase activity. This process
requires GTP hydrolysis. dTTP, bound to PrrC, is a coactivator with Stp. Its role could be to stabilize PrrC
that would otherwise be labile in its activated conformation. The tRNALys anticodon is then bound and cleaved
by the respective ACNase regions. But the phage provides the healing (Pnk) and sealing (Rnl1) enzymes
required to restore the affected tRNA, allowing the
phage to escape the cellular defense. The phage exclusion mechanism depicted here and the way the phage
wards off this cellular defense revealed an intimate physiological link between restriction-modification regulation and translational activity. The distribution of PrrC
homologs in unrelated bacteria and their systematic link
with type Ic R-M systems, suggest that the PrrC proteins have a cellular function not related to phage infection, possibly to disable protein synthesis under
conditions of stress that affect activity of type I DNA
restriction endonucleases [22,111,120].
Cellular RloC proteins

Using a bioinformatical approach, Davidov et al. [120]
recently found a new class of PrrC homologs called
RloC (restriction linked orf). RloC proteins are widespread in bacteria, although they are not present in
E. coli and only one was found in Archaea and none in
Eukarya. Genes for some of these proteins were first
characterized as linked to genes for type I or III R-M
enzymes in Campylobacter jejuni [123] however, now
only a minority of the rloC genes map to R-M loci.
RloC orthologues share with E. coli PrrC the presence
of ATPase motifs in the N-termini and the amino acid
triad thought to constitute the catalytic site in the C-termini. This structural homology is accompanied by a
functional homology: when expressed in E. coli, RloC
from the thermophilic Geobacillus kaustophilus exhibits
“ACNase” activity. Also, alanine substitutions of the
three amino acids of the triad abolish RloC ACNase.
However, RloC differs from PrrC in several respects: (1)
RloC substrate is still uncertain but it is not tRNALys;
(2) RloC ACNase actually excises the wobble nucleotide

Page 16 of 22

rather than just cleaves upstream; and (3) Like the other
RloC orthologues, the G. kaustophilus protein is larger
than PrrC because the N-terminal NTPase domain is
interrupted by a large coiled-coil fragment that’s similar
to sequences found in proteins implicated in DNA
repair. This fragment contains a typical “zinc hook”
motif able to co-ordinate Zn +2 ions. Mutations in the
zinc-hook motif lead to increased ACNase activity and
conversely, Zn+2 ions are inhibitory [120].
The RloC proteins show quite interesting and new
properties that lead to several questions.
a) Is the RloC-dependent ACNase normally maintained in a latent, inactive form that is activated
upon phage infection?
b) Since RloC excises the wobble nucleotide, is there
a phage that repairs this lesion? If not, this would be
an efficient mechanism of cellular defense against
phages.
c) Are there stress conditions, unrelated to phage
infection, that elicit RloC ACNase activation?
d) Are the RloC proteins associated with restrictionmodification proteins? If so, do they respond to the
presence of DNA?
By analogy with the PrrC ACNase, Kaufmann and colleagues [120] speculate that, in addition to conferring a
mechanism of phage exclusion, the RloC proteins couple
DNA damage that occurs under stress conditions, to
translation inactivation via tRNA cleavage. Their model is
based on two main observations: a) some proteins containing zinc-hook/coiled-coil domains are implicated in DNA
repair; and b) DNA damage leads to alleviation of type Ia
and Ic restriction enzymes, a process aimed at protecting
unmodified, newly synthesized DNA during the process of
repair and recovery from damaged DNA. The model
assumes that the RloC protein would sense DNA damage
signals via its zinc-hook and would convey activation to
the ACNase domain, possibly via conformation changes
driven by NTP hydrolysis. Such a model requires demonstrating a link between RloC proteins and DNA.
T4 exclusion by Gol-activated proteolysis of EF-Tu

Translation elongation is targeted in the T4 gol-lit phage
exclusion system [23,110]. Inhibition of translation
occurs when T4 gene 23 (the major head protein) is
translated during infection of E. coli cells that harbor
the defective prophage e14. The e14 element carries the
lit gene, which encodes a latent protease that, somewhat
similar to allosteric activation of latent PrrC ACNase
activity, is active on EF-Tu when the so-called gol region
of gene 23 is translated. Biochemical analyses of Lit/Gol/
EF-Tu interactions have revealed the process by which
phage exclusion occurs through proteolysis of EF-Tu.

Uzan and Miller Virology Journal 2010, 7:360

Page 17 of 22

A short 29-residue region of the gp23 polypeptide
defines Gol function, but a more stable interaction with
Ef-Tu appears to occur with 100 amino acids from the
first ¼ of gp23. Scanning mutagenesis showed 13 residues in a 20 amino acid core region of Gol to be most
important for its activity [124]. Binding of Gol to EF-Tu
is required to promote Lit reactivity. By binding to
domains II and III of EF-Tu, the Gol peptide promotes
Lit-mediated hydrolysis of EF-Tu between Gly59 - Ile60.
Binding of Gol peptide is preferential for the open EFTu:GDP complex, and binding itself inhibits the EF-Tu
GTPase of domain I. When Gol is bound to EF-Tu, it
appears that EF-Tu domain I is more accessible to Lit,
leading to “substrate-assisted” or “cofactor-induced”
activation of cleavage by the protease [124,125]. Lit is a
zinc metallo-protease with the active site motif HEXXH
of this protease class, but Gol does not contribute
directly to active site residues [124-126]. Kleanthous and
colleagues [124] have noted that the gp23 Gol region is
the most conserved region, in the overall conserved
gp23 major head protein of sequenced T4-related
phages. They suggest that gp23 of these phages interacts
with EF-Tu of all the respective hosts. While Gol interactions may be broadly relevant for translation and folding of this extremely abundant capsid protein, other
extant prophage-encoded, Lit-type proteases may also
elicit “cellular suicide” via Lit/Gol/EF-Tu proteolytic
assemblies.
Programmed translational bypassing

Topoisomerase of phage T4 is encoded by three genes:
39, 60 and 52. Most type II topoisomerases are comprised of two distinct subunits (i.e., gyrA and gyrB of
DNA gyrase) that are assembled as tetrameric A 2 B 2
enzymes. The adjacent T4 genes 39 and 60 are separated by 1010 nucleotides that include an apparently
defective HNH homing endonuclease gene (mobA) and
ORF 60.1 [95] (see [127] for a recent summary). Following their respective translation, gp39 and gp60 assemble
to comprise the “gyrB-like” large, ATP-hydrolyzing subunit of the T4 topoisomerase. In all other T4-related
phages sequenced to date, this subunit is encoded by a
single open reading frame that is typically annotated as
gene 39 (Figure 7).
An interesting, post-transcriptional feature in this
region of the T4 genome that has received considerable
attention is the presence of a 50 nucleotide “intervening
sequence” in the 5’ coding region of gene 60 that is transcribed into mRNA but is not translated into gp60. The
ribosome “hops” or “bypasses” the extra 50 bases in the
mRNA to produce the gp60 polypeptide in a process
termed programmed translational bypassing [128,129]. In
all other T4-related phages, not only are genes 39 and 60
joined as a single gene (they lack the mobA - 60.1

Figure 7 Model for programmed translational bypassing in T4
gene 60. A) In most T4-related phages, the large topoisomerase
subunit (gp39) is encoded by a single gene. In T4, active site
domains are interrupted by the mobA-60.1 coding region where the
downstream ORF (gp60) contains the 50 nucleotide bypassed
sequence. Elements in the mRNA that code for translational
bypassing are shown. B) Recapitulation of the model [127] where E-,
P- and A- sites of the ribosome are shown as translation enters the
bypass region (blue mRNA). Nascent peptide is shown in gold and
as promoting “take-off” from the green GGA codon. In (C) the
bypass mRNA stem-loop structure occupies the A-site, precluding
release factor 1 [66] from binding and inhibiting termination.
Ribosomal protein L9 facilitates tRNA exit through the E-site and
nascent peptide interactions prevent peptidyl-tRNA scanning. D)
Landing site codon:anticodon pairing is shown, with entry of the
resuming charged tRNA into the A-site for translating the distal
region of gene 60 mRNA. The GAG six nucleotides 5’ of the landing
site is shown pairing with the 16S rRNA anti-SD region to help
reinitiate peptidyl-tRNA scanning and pairing at the GGA. Figure

insertion), but none appears to have the intervening gap
nucleotides that would suggest programmed translational
bypassing. The process appears to be unique to T4 gene
60, but its study has shed new light on the mechanisms
of translation. Atkins, Gesteland and colleagues at the
University of Utah have studied many of the features that
promote programmed translational bypassing by E. coli
ribosomes on this unique T4 mRNA; the reader is urged
to read further details through their primary research
articles and reviews on the topic [129-131]. It is important to emphasize that experiments elucidating processes
affecting gene 60 translational bypassing have provided
new insights to the general mechanisms of mRNA decoding, including the roles of mRNA sequence and structure,
peptidyl-tRNA interactions within the ribosome, occupancy of ribosome decoding sites, and many other features of translating ribosomes.
Figure 7 summarizes the major components of the T4
programmed translational bypass in gene 60 transcripts, as
elaborated by the Utah group. Some of principal features
include: a domain of the nascent gp60 polypeptide preceding the hop, the glycine 46 codon GGA at the end of the
initial ORF (the “take-off site”), a UGA stop codon in the
gap right after the GGA take-off codon, a stem-loop
mRNA structure with a stabilizing tetraloop that is formed
by gap RNA nucleotides, the peptidyl-tRNA2Gly occupying
the P site of the ribosome, rRNA:mRNA interactions during scanning of the gap by the ribosome, the L9 subunit of
the ribosome, and the 50 nucleotide distal GGA codon
after the gap nucleotides (the “landing site”) [127,132-138].
Protein fusions, mass spectrometry, targeted mutations
and a number of analyses have combined to address the
roles of each component, leading to an approximately 50%
efficiency of ribosomes bypassing the intervening 50
nucleotides to land correctly at the downstream GGA
codon. Translation then resumes as the next UUA codon
and cognate tRNA enter the A site. Again, each of these
features shed new light not only on mechanisms of translational bypassing and aspects of “re-programming” the
basic genetic code, but also on the dynamics and numerous interactions occurring in all translating ribosomes. It
will be interesting to see whether instances of programmed translational bypassing occur in other genes of
the many T4-related bacteriophages.
ADP-ribosyltransferases in post-transcriptional control

T4 encodes three enzymes that covalently modify proteins via ADP-ribosylation during the infection cycle:
Alt, ModA and ModB. Alt is injected with phage DNA
to immediately initiate ADP-ribosylation of one of the
a-subunits (at arginine 265) of RNA polymerase, and by
about 4 minutes post-infection newly synthesized ModA
completes modification of both a-subunits at the same

Page 18 of 22

arginine. The biochemistry of T4-directed ADP-ribosylation of RNA polymerase and its impact on phage promoter selection have been reviewed [2,139].
Other E. coli proteins have been recognized as undergoing ADP-ribosylation during T4 infection, which primarily appears to be due to the activity of Alt and ModB.
Alt ADP-ribosylates b, b’ and s subunits of RNA polymerase and also other host proteins. The modifications
also include proteins of the translation apparatus, as
shown by Ruger and colleagues using the purified proteins [140]. An in vitro system incubated with total E. coli
proteins (cell extract), purified Alt or ModB, and 32 P
[NAD+] showed with mass spectrometry that ADP-ribosylation occurred on as many as 27 proteins by Alt and
on approximately 8 proteins by ModB [141]. For Alt,
these included EF-Tu, trigger factor, prolyl-tRNA synthetase and GroEL that are known to have important roles
in translation or protein folding. ModB also ADP-ribosylates EF-Tu and trigger factor, as well as ribosomal protein S1 [142]. For trigger factor (a chaperone of newly
translated proteins), arginine 45 is ADP-ribosylated by
ModB, but not by Alt, which must target a different, as
yet unidentified amino acid [141]. Arg45 lies in the
Phe44-Arg45-Lys46 domain that interacts with ribosomal
protein L23, and thus might affect ribosome conformation and translation, as certainly would modifications to
EF-Tu and S1. Early studies noted rapid & immediate
shut-off of host mRNA translation during T4 infection
[143], but no clear mechanism has been elucidated. The
identification of pivotal proteins in the translation apparatus as targets of T4 ADP-ribosyltransferases, together
with the observed delivery of Alt into the cell with the
injected DNA and the lethality to the cell of overexpressed ModB [142], suggest that mechanistic studies
into the impact of these T4 enzymes on translation of
host and phage mRNAs is warranted.

Conclusions
Although post-transcriptional control in T4 development and gene expression has been appreciated and studied for decades, many of the molecular details,
especially for specific RNA-protein interactions, have yet
to be resolved. For most, crystal or solution structures
of bound mRNA-repressor or RNA-nuclease complexes
would significantly advance our understanding of complex formation and substrate interactions in catalysis.
While clearly germane to T4 and the large diversity of
T4-related bacteriophages in the biosphere, continued
study of post-transcriptional processes directed by these
phages will provide new advances in the biochemistry
pertinent to all cellular systems. Undoubtedly new antivirals and anti-microbials targeting these and related
systems in pathogens can be anticipated.
