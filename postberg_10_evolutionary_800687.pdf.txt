The evolutionary history of histone H3 suggests a
deep eukaryotic root of chromatin modifying
mechanisms
Jan Postberg1*, Sakeh Forcob1, Wei-Jen Chang2, Hans J Lipps1

Abstract
Background: The phenotype of an organism is an outcome of both its genotype, encoding the primary sequence
of proteins, and the developmental orchestration of gene expression. The substrate of gene expression in
eukaryotes is the chromatin, whose fundamental units are nucleosomes composed of DNA wrapped around each
two of the core histone types H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. Key regulatory steps involved in the determination of
chromatin conformations are posttranslational modifications (PTM) at histone tails as well as the assembly of
histone variants into nucleosomal arrays. Although the mechanistic background is fragmentary understood, it
appears that the chromatin signature of metazoan cell types is inheritable over generations. Even less understood
is the conservation of epigenetic mechanisms among eukaryotes and their origins.
Results: In the light of recent progress in understanding the tree of eukaryotic life we discovered the origin of
histone H3 by phylogenetic analyses of variants from all supergroups, which allowed the reconstruction of
ancestral states. We found that H3 variants evolved frequently but independently within related species of almost
all eukaryotic supergroups. Interestingly, we found all core histone types encoded in the genome of a basal
dinoflagellate and H3 variants in two other species, although is was reported that dinoflagellate chromatin is not
organized into nucleosomes.
Most probably one or more animal/nuclearid H3.3-like variants gave rise to H3 variants of all opisthokonts (animals,
choanozoa, fungi, nuclearids, Amoebozoa). H3.2 and H3.1 as well as H3.1t are derivatives of H3.3, whereas H3.2
evolved already in early branching animals, such as Trichoplax. H3.1 and H3.1t are probably restricted to mammals.
We deduced a model for protoH3 of the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) confirming a remarkable degree
of sequence conservation in comparison to canonical human H3.1. We found evidence that multiple PTMs are conserved even in putatively early branching eukaryotic taxa (Euglenozoa/Excavata).
Conclusions: At least a basal repertoire of chromatin modifying mechanisms appears to share old common
ancestry and may thus be inherent to all eukaryotes. We speculate that epigenetic principles responsive to
environmental triggers may have had influenced phenotypic variation and concomitantly may potentially have had
impact on eukaryotic diversification.

Background
The regulation of eukaryotic gene expression occurs in
the context of DNA fibres compacted by interactions
with proteins - the chromatin, where on the first level
of compaction the DNA is wrapped around a protein
octamer composed of the four core histone proteins
types H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 forming the nucleosome.

This fibre becomes further compacted by the interaction with linker histone H1 and other proteins, forming a 30 nm fibre [1,2]. Many archaea are known to
possess histones, which most probably share common
ancestry with the histone fold domains of eukaryotic
H3 and H4. Short conserved segments (corresponding
to human H3.1E98-R130 or human H4K60-R93,
respectively) shared by many archaeal histones and
eukaryotic H3 and H4 are illustrated in Figure 1.
These archaeal histones interact with the genomic

Figure 1 Phylogenetic relationsship between eukaryotic core histone types H3 and H4 as well as archaeal histones. A bootstrap
consensus Neighbour Joining tree (A.) illustrates the phylogenetic relationsship between eukaryotic histones H3 and H4 as well as archaeal
histones, which share common ancestry. More divergent H3 and H4 variants of kinetoplastids occur as sister groups with regard to their variants
from other eukaryotes, probably due to long branch attraction. Similarly CenH3 variants occur as long branching sequences. The protein
sequence alignment (B.) shows a conserved region from the histone fold domains of several eukaryotic histones H3 and H4 as well as archaeal
histones. Residues identical in >95% of all sequences are shaded black. Residues similar in >95% of all sequences are shaded grey.

DNA as tetrameric complexes [3-5]. In eukaryotes
posttranslational modifications (PTMs, e.g. acetylation,
methylation, phosphorylation) at the N-termini of all
histone types can alter the degree of chromatin compaction [6]. Besides PTMs the incorporation of histone
variants into chromatin, particularly of histones H3
and H2A, seems to play a crucial role for the establishment of specific chromatin states. Histone H3 has a
globular C-terminal domain (histone fold), which

harbours four helix motifs (aN, a1, a2, a3). A putative
recognition site for histone chaperones involved in
nucleosome assembly partially overlaps with the a2helix (compare Additional file 1). Most PTMs are targeted to the unstructured N-terminus that protrudes
from the nucleosome [7-9]. It seems to be a general
eukaryotic feature that the unstructured N-terminal
sequences of H3 are more divergent between species
than the C-terminal globular domain.

Chromatin modifying mechanisms play a superordinate
role in the orchestration of developmental processes,
thus influencing phenotypic differentiation. Recent studies have also shown that some chromatin modifying
mechanisms are responsive to environmental agents
[10-14], which hereby can act as triggers of gene expression. It is under controversial discussion whether some
epigenetic features, which include PTMs of histones and
assembly of specific histone variants into discrete chromatin segments, contribute to epigenetic memory and
may thus be inheritable over generations without genotypic changes [6,9,15]. Accordingly epigenetic mechanisms
possibly may affect natural selection and thus had influenced the diversification of eukaryotic life [16].
However, the diversity of epigenetic mechanisms, their
common themes as well as differences, and finally their
potential impact to the evolution of eukaryotes remains
largely unexplored. From all core histone types, variants
of histone H3 with their dynamic posttranslational modifications have been most extensively studied in selected
model organisms to date. In order to discover the evolutionary history of basal chromatin modifying mechanisms, we decided to undertake combined phylogenetic
and molecular biological analyses focusing on variants
of the core histone H3 and its PTM signature.

Results and Discussion
To date phylogenetic analyses of histone H3 variants
were limited due to poor data availability of sequences
from species representing putatively early branching
eukaryotes. If not neglected totally parasitic organisms,
such as Entamoeba, were usually used to represent putatively early branching eukaryotic supergroups [17-19].
On the other hand multicellular organisms were often
overrepresented in such analyses. The highly divergent
H3 variants of some parasitic organisms usually led them
to be placed at the basis of phylogenetic trees, whereas
histone H3 family members of metazoa and plants often
appeared as “crown group” members. Although it was
already known for decades that histone H3 is highly conserved in many eukaryotic species, the topology of such
phylogenetic trees could be interpreted in a way that the
ancestral eukaryotic histone H3 was highly divergent in
comparison with H3 of “crown group” eukaryotes. However, we hypothesize that the placement of the divergent
H3 variants of parasites near the root of such trees was
an artifact due to long-branch attraction.
We therefore reinvestigated the phylogeny of histone
H3 in the light of recent progress in understanding the
tree of life and eukaryogenesis [20-24]. While some
uncertainty about the position of the eukaryotic root
remains (whether it is 1. between unikonts and bikonts,
2. inside the excavates, or 3. between early diverging
euglenozoa and excavates), it appears that opisthokonts

Page 3 of 13

(animals, choanozoa, fungi) and amoebozoa (all grouped
together as Unikonta) diverged early from chromists
and plants (part of the Bikonta group), resulting in a
deep cleft between those eukaryotic supergroups and a
multifurcated tree without “crown groups” (Additional
file 2). Importantly, we found that the protein sequences
of some histone H3 variants between selected species
from Unikonta and Bikonta are remarkably invariant.
To mention only two of multiple examples, histone H3
variant protein sequences between the choanoflagellate
Monosiga brevicollis (Unikonta; XP_001749159) and
Arabidopsis thaliana (Bikonta; NP_189372) vary in only
2 out of 135 residues (~98,5% identity). Similarly, histone H3 from Nuclearia simplex (Unikonta;
NXL00000490) deviates in only 4 out of 135 residues
from histone H3 in the green alga Ostreococcus lucimarinus (Bikonta; ABO96363) (~97% identity) (Additional
file 1; Additional file 2; Additional file 3). Histone H3
variants ancestral to choanoflagellates and plants or
nuclearids and green algae, respectively, consequently
had most likely been very similar to these histone H3
variants. As a working hypothesis we therefore assumed,
that this possibly could even be true for the H3 (variants) of the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA).
Highly conserved H3 variants occur even in putatively
early branching eukaryotic clades

To test our working hypothesis we resampled histone H3
protein sequences from all eukaryotic supergroups
(Opisthokonta, Amoebozoa, Archaeplastida, Rhizaria,
Chromalveolata and Excavata) [25] using various databases from completely sequenced genomes or fragmentary EST projects as sources (Histone Sequence
Database: http://genome.nhgri.nih.gov/histones/; GeneBank: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/; RefSeq:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/; TBestDB: http://
tbestdb.bcm.umontreal.ca/searches/welcome.php). We
focused on the identification of H3 sequences from nonparasitic organisms representing putatively early branching Euglenozoa and Excavata. Importantly, we were able
to assemble multiple new histone H3 sequences from
various species of putatively early branching eukaryotes
(among others: Reclinomonas americana, Euglena gracilis, Naegleria gruberi, Sawyeria marylandensis, Streblomastix strix). We also obtained sequences of histone H3
variants from a ciliated protist, Stylonychia lemnae
(Additional file 1; Additional file 3). To our best knowledge the resulting dataset represents the most complete
representation of histone H3 variant sequences available.
Interestingly, we found extremely conserved histone
H3 sequences and remarkable examples of divergent H3
variants in all eukaryotic supergroups (Additional file 1;
Additional file 3), importantly also in non-parasitic
Euglenozoa and Excavata. Presuming an early divergence

of Unikonta and the Plantae/Chromista groups from
Excavata or Euglenozoa, respectively, we assumed that
the protoeukaryotic histone H3 (protoH3) of LECA
must have been rather invariant from canonical histone
H3 (human H3.1).
To strengthen this hypothesis we performed phylogenetic analyses using a combined histone fold dataset of
H3 variants as well as CenH3 variants. These analyses
typically resulted in tree topologies, where putative stem
H3 variants occurred separated from divergent parasitic
H3 variants (e.g. from Kinetoplastids or Giardia lamblia) as well as CenH3 variants (Figure 2A). A common
ancestry of mammalian and avian CENP-A proteins (to
some extent also of lower vertebrate and non-vertebrate
CENP-As; clade marked by red rhomb in Figure 2A)
was supported by high bootstrap values. Further a fungal
CenpH3 clade was well supported (clade marked by
magenta rhomb in Figure 2A). However, since divergent
H3 variants and other eukaryotic CenH3 s did not
occur as monophyletic groups, proteins not characterized yet could not be assigned to a H3-like or CenH3like function by their phylogenetic position. Our analyses leave open whether a protoCenH3 ancestral to all
eukaryotic CenH3 s had existed or whether extant
CenH3 s have multiple origins in eukaryotic evolution.
We next inferred H3 variant phylogenetic trees using
a dataset of full-length protein sequences from which
long branching H3 variants with uncertain position were
eliminated (Figure 2B; Additional file 1; Additional file
3). Such sequences mostly represented parasitic species
(among others Encephalitozoon, Giardia, Spironucleus),
which showed tendency to be positioned at the bottom
of trees, including all characterized and putative CenH3
derivatives. Although the bootstrap support for such
unrooted trees was weak for numerous clades, the
monophyly of many groups was well represented (e.g.
Animals, Fungi, Oligohymenophorea/Ciliophora/Chromista, Spirotrichea/Ciliophora/Chromista), whereas the
monophyly of Amoebozoa, Chromista (Apicomplexa,
Heterokonta, Rhizaria) and Archaeplastidae could only
weakly or not be resolved, probably due to the generally
very high degree of H3 sequence similarity in those
groups (Additional file 1; Additional file 3). As a global
observation we discovered, that variations in H3 protein
sequences often occurred within motifs involved in writing and reading the PTM signature as well as in the
putative histone chaperone recognition domain (amino
acids 85-101, referring to human H3.1).
Histone H3 variants have evolved frequently, but
independently in related species of almost all eukaryotic
supergroups

Differences between H3 variants recognized frequently
involve the presence or absence of discrete putative

Page 4 of 13

phosphorylation sites (e.g. S/N10, S/T/A28, S/T/A31, S/
A96), suggesting a cell cycle dependent regulation by
phosphorylation of specific H3 variants. Since phosphorylation of serine, or presumably also threonine, can prevent or even disrupt binding of effector proteins (e.g.
heterochromatin-binding protein 1, HP1) at adjacent
methylated lysine residues, it can be assumed that such
sites could also function as switches regulating the chromatin signature [26,27]. The presence or absence of
phosphorylation sites therefore suggests important nonredundant biological functions of such H3 variants.
Our data suggest, that a variant similar to the replication-independent mammalian histone H3.3 - but not the
(canonical) H3.1 - was likely ancestral to H3 variants of
fungi and their sister group nuclearids as well as choanozoa and animals. In many metazoan species H3.3
occurs with identical (e.g. in human, mouse, Xenopus,
Branchiostoma, Drosophila) or slightly different protein
sequence (S96 replaced by A96 in Hydra, Nematostella,
Trichoplax). Notably, in our phylogenetic analyses the
only H3 from Nuclearia simpex we could identify occurs
near the root of the animal H3.3 clade. This H3.3-like
variant deviates from human H3.3 only in one substitution (H3.3S87 in Nuclearia; H3.3A87 in Homo). In
Opisthokonta S87 occurs predominantly in fungal H3
variants (notably also in animal H3.2 and H3.1), whereas
A87 is found in animals, choanoflagellates and most
sequences of Amoebozoa. For example in two putative
stem Amoebozoa species A87 is found in a H3 variant
of Mastigamoeba balamuthi (~94% identical to animal/
nuclearid H3.3), whereas S87 is found in a 118 aa H3
sequence fragment of Hyperamoeba dachnya (~90%
identical). Remarkably, S87 dominates in H3 variants of
Bikonta. We conclude that one or more H3 variants
very similar to animal/nuclearid H3.3 gave rise to all H3
variants found in extant opisthokonts.
Deriving from an animal/nuclearid H3.3S87-like precursor, we found identical homologs of histone H3.2 in
early branching animals, such as Trichoplax adherens,
suggesting that this replication-dependent H3 variant
might have evolved early during metazoan evolution, as
well as in organisms like Drosophila, Branchiostoma,
Xenopus, Monodelphis, mouse and human. H3.1, which
only differs from H3.2 insofar that H3S96 is replaced by
H3C96, as well as the testis-specific H3.1t could only be
found in mammals. These H3 variants most likely have
a late origin in metazoan evolution. Putative additional
variants were also identified in some animals (Additional
file 1; Additional file 3).
Interestingly, in animals the highest number of H3
variants was identified in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (5)* (*Numerical data displayed here and
below exclude long branching H3 variants, whose biological function could deviate from “nucleosomal” H3 s, as

Figure 2 The evolutionary history of histone H3 and CenH3 variants. A. The evolutionary history of 159 H3 and CenH3 variants was inferred
using the Neighbor-Joining method [48]. B. The evolutionary relationship of 128 non-redundant histone variants was inferred using the
Neighbor-Joining method [48]. Importantly, animal stem H3 variants are identical in a broad range of species: For example, H3.3A96 (1) is
identical in Trichoplax, Hydra, Nematostella, Buddenbrockia, and identical H3.3S96 (2) is found in Drosophila, Strongylocentrotus, Branchiostoma,
Xenopus and many mammals. Further, H3.1 (3) is identical in mammals from mouse to human. Identical H3.2 (4) variants occur in organisms like
Trichoplax, Drosophila, Branchiostoma, Xenopus and many mammals. The monophyly of several eukaryotic clades was well supported by
phylogenetic analyses of histone H3 variant sequences. Pairwise comparison of selected H3 variants (indicated by arrows) from Unikonta or
Bikonta species, respectively, revealed very high degrees of sequence conservation resulting in only rough separation of these clades. Due to
very limited sequence variability no support for chromista or plant monophlyly could be found. However, two ciliate classes,
Oligohymenophorea (e.g. Tetrahymena and Paramecium) and Spirotrichea (e.g. Stylonychia and Euplotes) were faithfully separated. Importantly,
multiple H3 variants from Eozoa (Excavata + Euglenozoa) branched close to conserved H3 variants from other groups, predominantly
Chromalveolata (Euglena, Reclinomonas, Sawyeria, Trichomonas, Streblomastix). All long branching Eozoa (Leishmania, Trypanosoma, Diplonema,
Giardia, Spironucleus) or Microsporidia (Enterocytozoon, Encephalitozoon) H3 variants are parasites.

well as CenH3s). However, the occurrence of numerous
H3 variants is not restricted to animals. Our analyses
strongly suggest that they have evolved frequently and
independently in many eukaryotic taxa. For example, we
characterized the macronuclear genomic sequences of at

least 7 core histone H3 variants and one putative
CenH3 variant (mdp64) in the spirotrichous ciliate species Stylonychia lemnae, which have been partially identified before by Bernhard [28] - to our best knowledge
the highest number of H3 variants found so far in

Postberg et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:259

nature. Interestingly, the main differences of these Stylonychia H3 variants are within sequence motifs known to
be involved in ‘writing’ or ‘reading’ the histone PTM signature, thus determining chromatin higher order structure (Figure 3A; Additional file 1; Additional file 3).
Since spirotrichous ciliates like Stylonychia exhibit enormous developmental reorganization of their genome
during sexual reproduction, involving multiple epigenetic mechanisms [29-31], it can be speculated that
those H3 variants could play important roles in the regulation of these processes. To address this hypothesis
experimentally we performed expression analyses of Stylonychia lemnae histone H3 variants by PCR (Figure 3B)
and quantitative real-time PCR (Figure 3C) using developmental stage specific cDNA. Notably, we were not
able to faithfully distinguish the highly similar variants
H3v2, H3v7 and H3v9. We therefore decided to treat
H3v2, H3v7 and H3v9 as equal. These experiments not
only demonstrated that all H3 variants were expressed
in a developmental stage specific manner, but also
showed significant differences in their relative

Page 6 of 13

expression rates (e.g. on their peaks of expression high
levels of H3v5, H3v1 and H3v10 could be detected,
while relative levels of mdp64, H3v4, H3v8, H3v3 and
H3v2/v7/v9 were lower). Interestingly, the expression of
some variants (H3v1, H3v4, H3v10) was pronounced
during the first round of DNA amplification in the
course of macronuclear differentiation, while other variants were expressed at the onset of, or during the second round of DNA amplification (H3v2/v7/v9, H3v3,
H3v8, mdp64). The expression level of H3v5 appeared
to increase or decrease in parallel to the DNA content
in macronuclear anlagen, respectively (compare [29]).
Although detailed experimental data about the biological
relevance of each particular H3 variant in Stylonychia is
not yet available, their differential expression strongly
suggests that they are functionally non-redundant. Theoretically it can be ruled out to some extent that at least
a sub-fraction of the H3 variant nanochromosomes
encode non-functional proteins or represent pseudogenes, since programmed DNA reorganization in spirotrichous ciliates involves a comparison between the

germline (micronuclear) and the somatic (macronuclear)
genomes resulting in a selection of macronucleus-destined sequences (reviewed in [30]). In spirotrichous ciliates this genome comparison apparently involves a
proof-reading template from the old macronucleus [32],
which can be RNA [33]. We assume that such a proofreading mechanism could generally and efficiently lead
to the elimination of non-expressed nanochromosomes
from the developing macronucleus.
Examples of increased H3 variant numbers within
related species could be found in almost all eukaryotic
supergroups by our analyses (Additional file 1; Additional file 3) or by other researchers (compare public
databases mentioned above), for example in Fungi (3 in
Candida albicans), Amoebozoa (3 in Entamoeba sp. and
Dictyostelium discoideum), Plants (3 in Arabidopsis
thaliana), Apicomplexa/Chromista (3 in Plasmodium
falciparum), Heterokonta/Chromista (2 in Hyaloperonospora parasiticum, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Phytophtora infestans), also in excavates (2 in Sawyeria
marylandensis, Trichomonas vaginals) and more divergent H3 variants in euglenozoa (2 in Trypanosoma sp.).
Since we could identify only one H3 sequence from a
Rhizaria species, we can make no statement for this
group, whether H3 variants exist or not.
Do derived H3 variants exist in dinoflagellates?

Using nuclease digestion experiments and electron
microscopic approaches it has been observed, that the
most portion of chromatin in dinoflagellates is not organized into nucleosomal repeats [34-36]. In all dinoflagellates examined to date the DNA:protein ratio within
chromatin is very small (~10:1). The protein fraction
contains several basic histone-like proteins, which exhibit some similarities with both bacterial histone-like
proteins and eukaryotic histone H1 [37]. Surprisingly,
we found putative H3 variants in Perkinsus marinus
(inc. sed., probably related to dinoflagellates or apicomplexans) as well as in the dinoflagellates Pyrocystis
lunula and Karlodinium micrum (Additional file 1;
Additional file 3). Histone H3 of Perkinsus marinus possesses several conserved motifs adjacent to lysines targeted by PTM in other eukaryotes (e.g. K4, K9, K27,
K36), whereas K9/K27 motifs are absent in Karlodinium
micrum and Pyrocystis lunula. Furthermore the K36
motif lacks in Pyrocystis lunula. Since the Pyrocystis H3
variant seems to be among numerous genes whose
expression profiles are affected by oxidative stress [38],
evidence exist at least for this H3 variant at both the
genomic and the transcriptional level.
Remarkably, in Perkinsus marinus we found also
sequences encoding core histones H4 (GeneBank
XM_002777579), H2A (GeneBank XM_002772145) and
H2B (GeneBank XM_002787339) but no sequences

homologous to other dinoflagellate histone-like proteins
[37], suggesting that the chromatin organization of this
basal dinoflagellate [39] relies on nucleosomes.
On closer look we could not identify further core histone types in the genomes of Karlodinium micrum or
Pyrocystis lunula, whereas we found one H2A-family
sequence fragment in another dinoflagellate, Alexandrium tamarense (GeneBank AY849372). Our observation suggests that these histone variants are the only
core histone types involved in chromatin organization in
these species, raising the question what could be the
consequences on chromatin structure. Without experimental evidence we can only speculate that in dinoflagellates like Karlodinium micrum or Pyrocystis lunula,
which apparently do not possess a complete set of core
histone types, H3 variants could be involved into chromatin organization of a fraction of the genome, similar
to spermatozoa in many species, which replace most
histones by protamines but retain nucleosomal chromatin organization at some genomic loci (reviewed in
[40]). It cannot be excluded that H3 variants interact
with histone-like proteins. But realizing that the histone-fold domains of all four core histones are structurally very similar [8], it also seems very plausible that
the formation of H3 homodimers which possibly further
assemble into tetramers and octamers is propagated.
However, the presence of all four core histone types in
a basal dinoflagellate like Perkinsus marinus and also the
evidence for single core histone types in other species
strongly support the view that the alternative chromatin
organization in most representatives of that phylum is a
derived, not an ancestral feature in dinoflagellate chromatin evolution.
Divergent histone H3 variants from various supergroups
represent a derived, not the ancestral state

Due to the presence of conserved H3 variants with high
similarity to animal/nuclearid H3.3-like variants in
selected species of all eukaryotic supergroups, it may be
concluded that ancestral states are unlikely to be represented by the more divergent H3 variants in various
supergroups. Following these assumptions we deduced
ancestral states for selected clades well supported in our
phylogenetic analyses and subsequently a putative protoH3 sequence, which exhibits 87% sequence identity
compared with human (canonical) H3.1 (Figure 4; Additional file 4), confirming our initial hypothesis, that protoH3 variant(s) of LECA were rather invariant from
extant stem H3-like variants (e.g. animal or nuclearid
H3).
Among the variable residues, three positions (2%) alter
between the aromatic amino acids tyrosine (Y) or phenylalanine (F). The observed presence or absence of
putative phosphorylation sites at various positions as a

Figure 4 Reconstruction of ancestral histone H3 states. The ancestral state reconstruction of histone H3 variants from various clades
(corresponding nodes are highlighted in the group-specific phylogenetic trees by red rhombs in Figure 2B) and H3 variant(s) of LECA confirms a
high degree of sequence identity or similarity, respectively (shaded columns). Variable sites are highlighted (*); color scheme: basic amino acids
(blue), acidic amino acids (red), aromatic amino acids (orange), putative phosphorylation sites (green). Nuclearia simplex H3 was used as

file 4.

character state of many histone H3 variants is nicely
confirmed by the reconstruction of ancestral H3 s of all
supergroups as well as LECA’s protoH3 (Figure 4; Additional file 4). It seems therefore reasonable to assume
that multiple H3 variants could have had already
evolved in LECA. Importantly, almost all lysines (K) are
conserved in the reconstructed ancestral H3 sequences,
with the notable deviation of K54 from euglenozoa and
excavates, which alters between K and R (arginine) in
chromists and plants and has evolved to R54 in opisthokonts and amoebozoa (Figure 4; Additional file 4). Interestingly, the number of N-terminal lysines in the
divergent H3 variants of Trypanosoma and Leishmania
is almost identical to canonical H3 (compare Figure 5A;
Additional file 1; Additional file 3).
At least a basal repertoir of histone H3 modyfing
mechanisms shares common ancestry in all eukaryotes

As a consequence of this significant invariance of histone H3 in the course of eukaryotic evolution, where
diverging H3 variants reflect a derived - not the ancestral state, conserved epigenetic mechanisms targeting
histone H3 N-termini could be more widespread among
eukaryotes than expected or even primarily inherent to
all eukaryotes. To test whether selected PTMs occur at
conserved H3 N-termini (Figure 5A) in H3 variants of
presumably early branching eukaryotes, we performed
immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure 5B) and in
some cases Western analyses (Figure 5C) using antibodies targeted to specific histone modifications, which
tolerate slight alterations in adjacent amino acid motifs
but are reported to faithfully recognize the respective
PTM. We selected Euglena gracilis (Euglenozoa/nonparasitic) and Trichomonas vaginalis (Excavata/parasitic)
as representative species, since Euglena histone H3 differs in only one amino acid (A28) from human H3.1
(S28) in the N-terminal 40 residues (~98% identity).
Although the N-terminal sequence identity in comparison with human H3.1 does not exceed ~78% in two H3
variants of Trichomonas vaginalis the overall similarity
of these variants is higher than in other parasitic

Excavata/Euglenozoa model systems, such as Giardia,
Leishmania or Trypanosoma. Moreover motifs adjacent
to K4, K9, K14, K27 and K36 exhibit a high degree of
conservation. Importantly, we performed competition
assays as controls as described in [29]. For comparison
we monitored PTMs in various nuclear types of the ciliate Stylonychia lemnae, since antibodies used have been
extensively tested in this single cell organism before
[29]. We found multiple examples of PTMs occurring in
nuclei of both species, Euglena gracilis as well as Trichomonas vaginalis. Histone H3 acetylation at K9 or K14,
which in Stylonychia occurs in the transcriptionally
highly active macronuclei (M), was detected in nuclei
(n) of Euglena and in most undistinguished stages
observed in Trichomonas. Using antibodies targeted to
H3K36ac, which in Stylonychia is restricted to developing macronuclear anlagen (a), we could not detect this
PTM in Euglena, whereas signals were prominent in
nuclei of most stages of Trichomonas. H3K4me3 is
mostly associated with transcriptional activity as highlighted by strong macronuclear signals in Stylonychia
macronuclei (M). This PTM was detected in nuclei (n)
of Euglena and many undistinguished stages of Trichomonas. H3 methylated at K9 or K27 in the context of
ARKS/T sequence motifs frequently propagates binding
of heterochromatin binding protein 1 (HP1)-like chromobox proteins, often resulting in heterochromatin formation. In Stylonychia H3K27me3 occurs in the
heterochromatic micronuclei (m), which are silent in
gene expression. Using an antibody which cross-reacts
with H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 we observed nuclear signals corresponding to ARKme3S/T in both Euglena and
Trichomonas. The assumption that ARKme3S/T within
H3 tails could be involved in heterochromatin formation
even in early branching eukaryotes is strengthened by
the presence of numerous HP1-like chromodomain proteins encoded in the genomes of several representative
species, with at least 8 chromodomain proteins being
encoded in the genome of Trichomonas vaginalis (Additional file 5). Chromodomain sequences of exemplary
HP1 homologs shown in Additional file 5 have formally

Figure 5 Multiple histone H3 modifications are conserved in putatively early branching eukaryotes. Posttranslational histone H3
modifications (PTM) occur at conserved N-terminal sequence motifs (color shaded in A.) in Euglena gracilis as well as Trichomonas vaginalis as
suggested by immunofluorescence (B.) and Western (C.) analyses. C-marked images represent peptide competition assays as antibody specificity
control. Both species represent putatively early branching eukaryotic clades. In the immunofluorescence panel (B.) the various PTMs occur as
green signals, whereas nuclei and in some cases other nucleic acid-containing structures occur as red signals. In some cases DNA containing
structures where labelled as follows: micronucleus/during mitosis (m/m*), macronucleus (M), nucleus (n). Western analyses (C.) confirm that the
antibody targeted to H3K4me3 reacts with a protein band similar in size to histone H3 in Euglena and Trichomonas. Even H3K9ac/K14ac was
detected in both Euglena and Trichomonas.

the ability to bind ARKme3S/T, as it might carefully be
concluded from the conservation of 3 aromatic residues
forming an “aromatic cage” in HP1, which seems to be
crucial for ARKme3S/T binding [41,42]. At least a subfraction of these proteins possess the typical HP1-like
domain organization with a N-terminal chromodomain,
which usually contributes to the binding of ARKme3S/
T, and a C-terminal chromoshadowdomain, which is
thought to be involved in heterochromatin spreading
(Daniele Canzio, Narlikar Lab, submitted, pers. communication). Besides other biological functions, the formation of condensed chromosomes during mitosis involves
H3S10ph and/or H3S28ph in many organisms, as shown
here for H3S28ph during micronuclear division (m*) in
Stylonychia. We observed that H3S10ph also occurred
in nuclei of Euglena with a signal distribution reminiscent of condensed chromosomes, suggesting that this
biological function may have a deep eukaryotic root.
Remarkably, the only Euglena H3 variant recognized
does not posses H3S28. Occasionally, H3S10ph or
H3S28ph was also observed in nuclei of Trichomonas.
Western analyses using antibodies targeted to H3K4me3
or H3K9acK14ac revealed a H3-sized protein band
(Figure 5C), whereas other antibodies used in microscopy failed to detect linearized proteins immobilized on
a nitrocellulose membrane.
Remarkably, multiple PTMs at specific sites have also
been identified in the divergent core histone types of
Trypanosoma brucei [43,44]. Thus our analyses contribute to the view that numerous PTMs occur in various
Excavata and Euglenozoa. With regard to the very high
degree of H3 protein sequence similarity and multiple
conserved PTMs found, especially in non-parasitic
Euglena gracilis, it seems likely that major chromatin
modifying mechanisms evolved early during eukaryogenesis, possibly directly accompanying the acquisition of
the nucleus, the invasive accumulation of genomic noncoding DNA and the organization of the genome into
chromosomes. We therefore speculate that such conserved epigenetic mechanisms, if inheritable, may have
had substantially contributed to the adaptation of organisms to environmental changes and consequently to the
diversification of eukaryotic life. However, conflicting
with this speculation, the very basic problem remains
unsolved, whether a genomic feedback on epigenetic
manifestations leading to genome encoded epigenetic
signatures is obligatory, or whether a long-term genome-independent persistence of epigenetic signatures
over many generations exists.

Conclusions
Multiple histone H3 variants evolved frequently but
independently within related species of almost all eukaryotic supergroups, whereby the presence of numerous

Page 10 of 13

variants in Rhizaria could not be shown due to the limited sequence data. Remarkably, we found at least 7 histone H3 variants in the spirotrichous ciliate Stylonychia
lemnae, which are expressed in a developmental stage
specific manner, but also show significant differences in
their relative expression rates.
Interestingly, although it has been reported that dinoflagellate chromatin is not organized into nucleosomes,
we found that the genome of the basal dinoflagellate
species Perkinsus marinus encodes all four core histone
types suggesting a “classical” nucleosome-based type of
chromatin organization. Moreover we found H3 variants
encoded in the genomes of at least two other dinoflagellate species. A recurring theme in variants of histone H3
in almost all eukaryotic supergroups is the presence or
absence, respectively, of discrete putative phorsphorylation sites.
Our data confirm that an animal/nuclearid-like histone H3.3 variant was very likely ancestral to H3 variants of all opisthokonts. H3.2 and H3.1 as well as H3.1t
are derivatives of H3.3, whereas H3.2 evolved already in
early branching animals, such as Trichoplax. We found
no evidence for H3.1 and H3.1t outside of mammals.
The earlier observed numerical increase of particular H3
variants towards mammalian evolution [9] is biased,
since some “lower” eukaryotes have similar or even
higher numbers of H3 variants.
Our study confirms that protoH3 of LECA most probably was rather invariant from stem H3 variants, showing that grouping of divergent H3 variants from mostly
parasitic representatives of putatively early branching
eukaryotes close to the eukaryotic root is an artifact.
These H3 variants represent derived states rather than
being ancestral.
At least a basal repertoire of chromatin modifying
mechanisms must share a conserved common ancestry
and thus be inherent to all eukaryotes, as shown by the
presence of various PTMs on H3 tails in selected species
with conserved H3 sequences representing putatively
early branching eukayotic clades.

Methods
Bioinformatical sequence acquisition

Various nucleotide databases (Histone Sequence Database, GeneBank, RefSeq, TBestDB) were scanned for H3
sequences using Drosophila melanogaster H3.3 or CenpA
protein sequence as query for tBlastn. H3-similar hits
were virtually translated into proteins and used for alignment analyses. To identify phylogenetically distant H3 or
CenH3 variants from putatively early branching eukaryotic clades we re-used more diverging H3 variants found
before in some cases as query sequences for tBlastn.
Sequence fragments were assembled to full-length
sequences where sufficient fragment overlap was found.

Telomere suppression PCR and expression profiling

We fully characterized Stylonychia lemnae macronuclear
genome encoded H3 variants using degenerate oligonucleotides in combination with telomere suppression PCR
(TSP), a technique to amplify the 5’- or 3’-ends of Stylonychia nanochromosomes including their telomeric
sequences [45]. Sexual reproduction of Stylonychia was
initiated by mixing equal numbers of cells from different
mating types. Samples for cDNA synthesis were taken
periodically at time points as indicated. Total RNA was
isolated as described earlier [46]. Subsequently, cDNA
was synthesized using the Qiagen QuantiTect Reverse
Transcription kit. Quantitative Real-Time PCR was
performed on a Roche Light Cycler.
Alignments

Aligments were performed using ClustalW included in
MEGA 4.1 [47] and were subsequently manually refined.
Phylogenetic analyses and ancestral state reconstruction

Phylogenetic tree calculations were conducted using
MEGA 4.1 [47] software.
The evolutionary history of 159 H3 and CenH3 variants (Figure 2A) was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method [48]. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred
from 1.000 replicates [49] was taken to represent the
evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed. Evolutionary
distances were computed using the JTT matrix-based
method [50] and are in the units of the number of
amino acid substitutions per site. All positions containing alignment gaps and missing data were eliminated
only in pairwise sequence comparisons. The final dataset
contained a total of 100 positions.
The evolutionary relationship of 128 non-redundant
histone H3 variants (Figure 2B) was inferred as
described above. The bootstrap consensus tree was
inferred from 10.000 replicates [49]. Evolutionary distances were computed as described above. The final
dataset contained a total of 358 positions.
Ancestral states represented by selected internal nodes
from clades well supported by NJ tree topology were
reconstructed (compare node markers in Figure 2). The
putative ancestral sequences were subsequently
inspected by eye and manually refined.
Immunofluorescence microscopy

Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (Stylonychia,
Trichomonas) or alternatively in methanol:acetic acid
(3:1) (Euglena), washed twice with phosphate buffered
saline (PBS), and immobilized onto poly-L-lysine coated
coverslips. Subsequently immunostaining with PTMspecific antibodies and in some experiments peptide
competition assays were performed as described earlier
[29]. Cells were analyzed by confocal laser scanning

Page 11 of 13

microscopy (CLSM). Acquisition of serial sections was
done with a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal confocal laser scanning
microscope equipped with a water objective lens (PlanNeofluar 25/0.8, or in some cases C-Apochromat 63/
1.2). Fluorochromes were visualized with an argon laser
with excitation wavelengths of 488 nm for Alexa Fluor
488 and 514 nm for SYTOX Orange. Fluorochrome
images were scanned sequentially generating 8 bit grayscale images. Image resolution was 512 × 512 pixels with
variable pixel size depending on the selected zoom factor. The axial distance between light optical serial sections was 300 nm. To obtain an improved signal to
noise ratio each section image was averaged from four
successive scans. The 8 bit grayscale single channel
images were overlaid to an RGB image assigning a false
color to each channel and then assembled into tables
using open source software ImageJ (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland,
USA, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/, 1997-2004.) and Adobe
Photoshop CS3 software.
SDS Page and Western Analyses

Cells were lysed, and subsequently total cellular proteins
were resuspended in loading buffer [51], heated for 10
min at 100°C, and separated on 15% sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were then
transferred onto a nylon membrane and probed with
specific antibodies. Detection was done using the digoxigenin system (Roche).
