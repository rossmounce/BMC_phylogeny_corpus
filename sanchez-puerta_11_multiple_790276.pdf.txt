intron in Solanaceae and extended co-conversion
of flanking exons

Abstract
Background: The most frequent case of horizontal transfer in plants involves a group I intron in the mitochondrial
gene cox1, which has been acquired via some 80 separate plant-to-plant transfer events among 833 diverse
angiosperms examined. This homing intron encodes an endonuclease thought to promote the intron’s
promiscuous behavior. A promising experimental approach to study endonuclease activity and intron transmission
involves somatic cell hybridization, which in plants leads to mitochondrial fusion and genome recombination.
However, the cox1 intron has not yet been found in the ideal group for plant somatic genetics - the Solanaceae.
We therefore undertook an extensive survey of this family to find members with the intron and to learn more
about the evolutionary history of this exceptionally mobile genetic element.
Results: Although 409 of the 426 species of Solanaceae examined lack the cox1 intron, it is uniformly present in
three phylogenetically disjunct clades. Despite strong overall incongruence of cox1 intron phylogeny with
angiosperm phylogeny, two of these clades possess nearly identical intron sequences and are monophyletic in
intron phylogeny. These two clades, and possibly the third also, contain a co-conversion tract (CCT) downstream of
the intron that is extended relative to all previously recognized CCTs in angiosperm cox1. Re-examination of all
published cox1 genes uncovered additional cases of extended co-conversion and identified a rare case of putative
intron loss, accompanied by full retention of the CCT.
Conclusions: We infer that the cox1 intron was separately and recently acquired by at least three different lineages
of Solanaceae. The striking identity of the intron and CCT from two of these lineages suggests that one of these
three intron captures may have occurred by a within-family transfer event. This is consistent with previous
evidence that horizontal transfer in plants is biased towards phylogenetically local events. The discovery of
extended co-conversion suggests that other cox1 conversions may be longer than realized but obscured by the
exceptional conservation of plant mitochondrial sequences. Our findings provide further support for the rampanttransfer model of cox1 intron evolution and recommend the Solanaceae as a model system for the experimental
analysis of cox1 intron transfer in plants.

Background
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is surprisingly common
in plant mitochondrial genomes, especially compared to
plant chloroplast and nuclear genomes [1-6]. A notable
case of HGT in plant mitochondria involves a “homing”
group I intron present in the mitochondrial cox1 gene
of many disparately related lineages of angiosperms. All
relevant studies [7-15] concur that this intron most
likely entered angiosperms only once, from a fungal
donor. With one exception [15], treated in the Discussion, these studies have, in aggregate, led to the conclusion that the intron subsequently spread rampantly
within angiosperms via HGT, with some 80 separate
angiosperm-to-angiosperm transfers postulated [8-12] to
account for the intron’s distribution among the 833
angiosperms analyzed thus far. Three lines of evidence
underlie the “rampant transfer” model for the evolution
of the cox1 intron in angiosperms: A) the intron has a
highly sporadic distribution among angiosperms, B) its
phylogeny is strongly incongruent with angiosperm phylogeny, and, C) with notably rare exception, it co-occurs
with a short, highly divergent “co-conversion tract”
located immediately downstream of the intron.
Homing introns are regarded as highly mobile, invasive elements due to the properties of the site-specific
DNA endonucleases that they encode, which facilitate
intron propagation [16,17]. Homing endonucleases catalyze the integration of the intron, via the double-strandbreak-repair pathway, into the target sequence (termed
the “homing site”) that is present in intron-lacking
alleles of the intron’s target gene (Figure 1). As a consequence of the degradation of the cleaved target
sequence and subsequent repair process, part of the foreign exonic regions immediately flanking the invading
intron often engages in a gene conversion activity that
replaces part of the host gene’s exonic sequence [16-20].
A region of converted exonic sequence is called a “coconversion tract” (CCT).
Although comparative evidence indicates that the cox1
intron has a highly invasive history in plants, no experimental study has been reported on its transmission or
mechanistic properties. This contrasts with the situation
for certain other homing group I introns, including the
cognate intron in yeast mitochondria, thanks to the
well-developed genetic systems available in microbial
models [16,18-20]. Human-engineered transformation of
plant mitochondrial genomes is not yet feasible, despite
many years of efforts and notable success in transforming chloroplasts [21]. This is paradoxical considering
that natural transformation (via HGT) is relatively common in plant mitochondria [1-6], but unheard of in
chloroplasts of land plants [22]. Classical genetics is also
problematic, because mitochondria are almost always
transmitted uniparentally (usually maternally) in sexual

crosses in plants and because appropriately wide crosses
are rarely successful. This leaves somatic cell genetics as
the approach of choice for manipulating plant mitochondrial genomes. Cytoplasmic hybrid plants (cybrids)
are created by fusing protoplasts from two different cultivars, species or genera and then generating whole
plants from the fusion products. Plant cybrids can be
made between relatively distantly related plants [23-27]
and almost invariably contain recombinant mitochondrial genomes owing to the propensity of mitochondria
to fuse with one another [28,29]. By analyzing cybrids
that combine intron-containing and intron-lacking parents, one should be able to test the hypothesis that the
angiosperm cox1 intron encodes a functional homing
endonuclease, assess rates of intron colonization, and
measure lengths of exonic CCTs.
The premier system for the efficient and large-scale
production of cybrid plants is the Solanaceae, one of the
largest (~2,500 species) and economically most

Sanchez-Puerta et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:277

important families of flowering plants (containing
potato, tomato, chili pepper, eggplant, tobacco, petunia).
Somatic genetics is best developed in tobacco (Nicotiana
tabacum), the favored plant for chloroplast transformation and “biopharming” [21,30-32]. Many other species
of Solanaceae also provide favorable material for somatic
cell genetics, and cybrids can be successfully produced
between relatively distantly related members of the
family [23-27]. The mitochondrial genome of tobacco
has been sequenced [33] and lacks the cox1 intron.
Similarly, the six other diverse, previously examined
representatives of the Solanaceae also lack this intron
[9,10,12]. Therefore, to be able to exploit the family for
somatic genetic studies of cox1 intron function, we surveyed over 400 diverse species of Solanaceae in order to
find members with the intron.
The second goal of this study was to gain further insight
into the evolutionary history of this exceptionally mobile
genetic element. In particular, we wished to test two predictions that follow from the inferred evolutionary history
of the cox1 intron. The first, which is predicated on the
intron’s frequent transfer within angiosperms [8-12], is
that greatly increased sampling in a large family in which
the intron has not been found based on current, scanty
sampling will uncover multiple intron acquisitions within
the family, with the intron-containing lineages embedded
within clades that lack both the intron and its associated
CCT. This prediction is obviously integral to the Solanaceae motivation of this study. Second, based on the apparent bias of cox1 intron transfer in plants toward
phylogenetically local events [10,12], we predict that a significant fraction of the intron transfers discovered in the
Solanaceae will turn out to be intrafamilial events.

Results
Intron presence-absence and phylogeny

PCR was used to assess the presence/absence of an intron
at the one site, near the middle of the cox1 gene, in which
all previously described cases of introns in this gene in
angiosperms have been found. This approach was facilitated by the conserved length (953-1,031 bp) of this intron
in angiosperms [9,12], as well as by the generally highly
conserved nature of plant mitochondrial sequences owing
to very low rates of synonymous substitutions [34-36]. A
total of 426 species (belonging to 70 genera) of the Solanaceae were examined (Figure 2; Additional File 1). The
great majority were sampled as part of an initial screening,
chosen to emphasize diversity across the family and based
on DNA availability. A follow-up screening sampled more
comprehensively within the three groups of Solanaceae
that were found to contain the intron, as well as in taxa
closely related to these groups.

Of the 426 species of Solanaceae examined, 409 (66
genera) gave a cox1 PCR product of the size (0.8 kb)
expected for an intron-lacking gene, whereas 17 (6 genera) yielded a product of the size (1.8 kb) expected for
an intron-containing gene (Figure 2). The 17 introncontaining species represent three phylogenetically disjunct lineages within the Solanaceae and include 14 species of Hyoscyameae (i.e., all examined members of
Hyoscyamus, Physochlaina, Przewalskia, and Scopolia), 2
of 3 examined species of Mandragora (mandrake), and a
single species of Brunfelsia (B. jamaicensis) out of 7
examined (Figure 2). Results for a number of the introncontaining species, including B. jamaicensis, were confirmed by sequencing multiple accessions from each of
these species (Additional File 1).
Sequencing of the 0.8-kb product from 48 diverse species (43 genera) of Solanaceae (Figure 2) confirmed in
all cases the absence of the intron. Sequencing of almost
all 1.8-kb products confirmed that they contain an
intron, located at the canonical angiosperm cox1 intron
insertion site. All Solanaceae introns are 967 bp in
length and contain a full-length and intact open reading
frame of 840 bp encoding a putative homing group I
endonuclease.
The Solanaceae cox1 introns were subjected to phylogenetic analyses as part of a data set that included 63
previously reported cox1 introns from a wide range of
angiosperms. As discussed in detail previously [9,12],
the cox1 intron phylogeny is highly incongruent with
angiosperm phylogeny (Figure 3). This incongruence is
most vividly depicted by the extensive interspersion of
colors on the intron tree (used to distinguish taxa
belonging to four ancient, major, and well-distinguished
groups of angiosperms), and contrasts markedly with
the organismal-congruence of a phylogeny (Figure 4)
based on cox1 exon sequences from 108 diverse angiosperms, including all those included in Figure 3. To highlight just one example of the incongruence between
cox1 intron and organismal phylogeny, note the 100%
bootstrap support for a clade containing introns from
the asterid Hydrocotyle, the rosid Polygala, and the
monocots Maranta and Monotagma (Figure 3).
The Solanaceae introns show evidence of both congruence and incongruence with angiosperm phylogeny. Two
of the three clades of Solanaceae introns - the Hyoscyameae and Mandragora clades - form a strongly supported
(90% bootstrap support) monophyletic group, whereas the
Brunfelsia jamaicensis intron is only distantly related to
these other Solanaceae introns (Figure 3).
Co-conversion tracts

To date, no recognizable CCT has been described in the
5’ exon of cox1, whereas a canonical CCT of minimally
3-21 bp is present in the 3’ exonic region immediately

Page 4 of 15

downstream of the intron [9,10,12,15]. This 3’ CCT is
defined by between 1 and 7, highly conserved, thirdposition synonymous-site differences and an effectively
silent difference at the C-to-U RNA editing site located
at position +20 relative to the intron insertion site (Figure 5). None of the 55 sequenced intron-lacking cox1
genes from the Solanaceae contains any sign of a 3’
CCT, whereas all 17 intron-containing genes do contain
a 3’ CCT motif (Figure 5). All 16 intron-containing cox1
genes from the Hyoscyameae and Mandragora clades
possess all 7 nucleotide differences that are diagnostic of
previously described CCTs of 20 bp in length (canonical
CCT; Figure 5). Furthermore, these 16 genes share two
additional differences in this region, at positions +27
and +35. This extended region of similarity probably
reflects longer tracts of 3’ co-conversion than any previously recognized for this intron in angiosperms. Note
the perfect correspondence between the presence of A
and T at positions +27 and +35, respectively, and the
presence of the intron in these two clades of Solanaceae
(Figure 5), i.e., all 55 sequenced intron-lacking cox1
genes from the Solanaceae contain the ancestral G and
C at these two positions. Furthermore, the possibility of
parallel substitutions at both positions in these two
intron-containing clades is remote given the extremely
high level of cox1 sequence conservation within the
family. Apart from the 9 differences that we take to
define a 3’ CCT of minimum length 35 bp (Figure 5),
the 744 bp of cox1 coding sequence determined for the
two intron-containing species of Mandragora are identical to the intron-lacking gene from M. caulescens except
for a single autapomorphy in the latter species (Additional File 2). Likewise, setting aside the putative 3’ CCT
of 35 bp and also the highly homoplasious sites -11 and
+60 (Figure 5), the 723-1,362 bp of cox1 sequence determined for the intron-containing Hyoscyameae are identical to the ancestral sequence for the tribe (Additional
File 2). Finally, the cox1 exons of all intron-containing
Mandragora and Hyoscyameae are identical, again
excepting the above-noted sites, to the ancestral cox1
sequence as reconstructed for the entire family Solanaceae (Additional File 2).
Discovery of 3’ CCTs of unprecedented length (in the
context of angiosperm cox1 genes) in these two lineages
of intron-containing Solanaceae led us to re-examine all
previously published angiosperm cox1 genes for potentially overlooked evidence of extended exonic co-conversion. In most cases, we saw no reason to change
published estimates of the minimum length of the 3’
CCT [9-12,15]. However, we did identify five additional
lineages of angiosperms for which we now infer longer
tracts of putative 3’ co-conversion than recognized previously. Three of these lineages are each represented by
a single examined species and have either an identical

Figure 5 Nucleotide alignment of cox1 exonic regions immediately flanking the intron insertion site. Taxa were chosen to represent the
broad diversity of cox1 intron types/lineages known among angiosperms, with space constraints allowing only a small number of intron-lacking
cox1 genes to be included. Among the latter genes, the Solanaceae are over-represented. Taxa are in phylogenetic order: brown, magnoliids;
green, monocots; red, rosids; blue, superasterids. Plus (+) and minus (-) symbols in the 0 column indicate cox1 intron presence or absence,
respectively. RNA editing sites are in red in the ancestral sequence. Sites diagnostic of extended co-conversion are in pinkish-brown
(Solanoideae, Melia and Cynomorium), blue (Acanthaceae), green (Musaceae), and yellow (Brunfelsia jamaicensis). Vertical bars at far left indicate
groups of taxa inferred to have acquired their introns by the same transfer event, with subsequent vertical transmission of the intron within each
marked clade, whereas all non-marked intron-containing taxa are inferred to have acquired their introns via separate transfers (Barkman et al.
2007; Sanchez-Puerta et al. 2008).

C. coccineum reside within the same large, essentially
unresolved group of introns (bottom third of Figure 3).
This group includes the introns from Hyoscyameae and
Mandragora, which as noted, share part of the 3’ CCT
extension found in Melia and C. coccineum. The monophyly of introns from all four of these lineages (Melia,
C. coccineum, Mandragora, and Hyoscyameae) is not
rejected by the Approximately Unbiased test [37], and
there is in fact one synapomorphy for these 4 sets of
introns (Additional File 2). We therefore conclude,
based essentially on CCT similarities, that these 4 sets
of introns constitute a clade with respect to cox1 intron
phylogeny. The absence of the intron from C. songaricum presumably reflects secondary intron loss given the
striking presence in the gene of an extended 3’ CCT
marked by 9 diagnostic characters.
The fourth extended-CCT lineage includes both
sampled members (Musa and Musella) of the Musaceae
(Zingiberales). Their cox1 genes lack the expected
monocot signatures at three clustered sites (positions
+42, +45, and +63) and instead possess a core-eudicot
signature T at +57, as well as T at a position (+60) that
is G in all other examined monocots but T in a number
of core eudicots (Figure 5). Apart from this short region,
the Musaceae cox1 genes share all of the many monocot- or Zingiberales-specific markers that are found
scattered across the rest of the gene, and, accordingly,
the Musaceae genes cluster strongly with other monocot
genes, and specifically with other Zingiberales genes, in
cox1 phylogeny (Figure 4). The Musaceae cox1 coding
sequence thus appears to be chimeric, consisting primarily of native sequence in which is embedded a small
region of eudicot-derived DNA that is minimally defined
by the above 5 diagnostic sites located between positions
42 and 63 of exon 2. Most likely, the Musaceae acquired
the cox1 intron from a eudicot donor by an event involving extended 3’ co-conversion that ended between
positions 63 and 70 (Figure 5).
The fifth extended-CCT lineage includes all 4 sampled
intron-containing members of the Acanthaceae (Sanchezia, Justicia, Barleria, and Thunbergia), which share
derived changes at positions +30, +35, and +54 (Figure
5). These are the only cox1 exonic synapomorphies for
the family other than the acquisition of the intron
together with its associated canonical CCT of 21 bp.
Two extreme models can account for the phylogenetic
co-occurrence of these 4 sets of changes in cox1: A)
they arose by 4 independent mutations in a common
ancestor of these 4 Acanthaceae, with the only 3 point
mutations on this branch happening by chance to be
clustered within a 25 bp tract (in a sequenced genelength of 1,313 bp), and with this tract happening to be
located just downstream of the phylogenetically concomitant insertion (and accompanying exonic co-

Page 8 of 15

conversion) of the cox1 intron, or B) all these changes
arose by the same event in an Acanthaceae common
ancestor, an event involving the insertion of a cox1
intron accompanied by 3’ co-conversion that extended
at least 54 bp in length. We strongly favor the latter
model, which predicts that further sampling of angiosperms will uncover a candidate donor lineage of the
Acanthaceae intron, with this lineage marked by the
stepwise point-mutational accumulation of those 3
nucleotides that define the putative 3’-extended-CCT in
Acanthaceae.
Finally, there is weak evidence that the newly reported
cox1 gene of Brunfelsia jamaicensis may also possess an
extended 3’ CCT. The evidence here derives from essentially a single position, +81, at which this species has
reverted from T to C relative to all 74 other examined
species from the Solanaceae, including 6 other Brunfelsia species (the +60 site also marked in B. jamaicensis
in Figure 5 carries little diagnostic weight owing to its
extensive homoplasy within the family).

Discussion
Three intron acquisitions during Solanaceae evolution:
further evidence for the rampant-transfer model of cox1
intron evolution and for phylogenetically local HGT

The cox1 intron is present in three distantly related
lineages of Solanaceae, two of which belong to the large
(~2,200 species) subfamily Solanoideae and one to the
tribe Petunieae (Figure 2). Brunfelsia jamaicensis, the
sole intron-containing member of the Petunieae among
the species tested, possesses an intron that is radically
different from those found in Solanoideae in overall
sequence (Figure 4 and Additional File 2), in associated
CCT sequence (Figure 5), and in phylogenetic position
(Figure 3). Phylogenetic analysis of the intron resolves
the three intron-containing Solanaceae lineages into two
separate clades, suggesting multiple independent origins
of the intron in Solanaceae (Figure 3). Furthermore, a
single origin of all three clades of Solanaceae introns is
strongly rejected (P = 0.00002) by the AU test. Ignoring
the intron’s disjunct distribution within Solanoideae (see
below), such an origin would also require a bare minimum (note the two major relevant polychotomies in
Solanaceae phylogeny; Figure 2) of five independent
losses of the intron elsewhere in the family, each concomitant with loss of the entire suite of CCT-diagnostic
characters. As explained below, such loss would require
extraordinary, if not entirely implausible, circumstances.
Given all this, it is clear that B. jamaicensis acquired its
intron independently of the intron-containing members
of the Solanoideae.
The situation within the Solanoideae is very different,
as its two, relatively distantly related lineages of introncontaining taxa contain highly similar introns, possess

Sanchez-Puerta et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:277
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/277

identical and distinctive CCTs, and their introns form a
strongly supported monophyletic group (Figures 3 and
5; Additional File 2). At the extreme, two models of
intron gain and loss can account for these data: A) the
intron was acquired once, at the base of the subfamily,
followed by between 5 and 13 losses, the exact number
of which depends on the resolution of three relevant
polychotomies within the group (Figures 2 and 6A), or
B) Mandragora and a clade within tribe Hyoscyameae
acquired the intron independently, with no intron losses
in the subfamily (Figure 6B).
We strongly favor the latter model. First, consider the
probability of loss versus gain of the cox1 intron. Intron
loss is in general a rare event in angiosperm mitochondrial genomes, including the Solanaceae [38] (Qiu, Y.L.,
N. Kubo & J.D. Palmer, unpublished), and so this would
represent an exceptional amount of intron loss, especially at this phylogenetic level. Moreover, the cox1
intron should be less prone to loss than other introns
because it alone among angiosperm mitochondrial
introns contains a homing endonuclease-like ORF,
whose predicted activity should cause intron-lacking

cox1 alleles that arise by the occasional retroprocessing
event to be re-colonized by the intron before they can
go to fixation [note that because the intron ORF is
nearly identical across all intron-containing Solanoideae,
its sequence is essentially the same as that of the ORF
upon arrival (i.e., homing), at which point the endonuclease must have been functional]. Finally, with respect
to the probability of intron gain, the cox1 intron is so
clearly a highly mobile intron that to postulate one additional horizontal transfer (two gains within Solanoideae
rather than one), when more than 80 such events have
already been documented [8-12], hardly stretches the
bounds of imagination.
Second, moving beyond the intron per se, consider the
exonic regions immediately flanking the cox1 intron. All
16 Solanoideae that possess the intron contain an identical, extended 3’ CCT marked by 9 diagnostic characters,
whereas all 30 sequenced subfamily members that lack
the intron also lack all 9 characters, featuring instead
the ancestral state at all 9 sites (Figure 5). Thus the
intron-loss model must account not only for multiple
intron losses, but also for the phylogenetically

concomitant “reversal” at all 9 CCT sites in each and
every case of intron loss. Reversal by point mutation is
inconceivable, considering A) how many sites are
involved, B) that all these changes would have occurred
en masse in the same 5-13 lineages without even a single CCT point mutation occurring elsewhere in the subfamily, and C) that cox1 is otherwise virtually identical
across the Solanoideae (Figure 4 and Additional File 2).
Reversal by gene conversion, e.g., by an ancestral-like
cox1 sequence present elsewhere in the mitochondrial
genome, is a more reasonable possibility, as this would
require but a single event in each intron-loss lineage
rather than 9 parallel point mutations. Also, gene conversion seems to be relatively common in plant mitochondrial genomes (e.g. [39-41]).
To explain the strict co-occurrence of putative intron
loss and gene conversion is, however, more challenging.
The only plausible mechanistic link between these two
events requires an additional mitochondrial copy of cox1
that A) lacked the intron, B) lacked the CCT, and C)
was retained in many descendant lineages throughout at
minimum the first 15 million years of early Solanoideae
diversification [42] (see next section for discussion of an
implausible but proposed mechanism). Under this scenario, the intron-lacking copy would have either converted the intron-containing copy - on 5-13 different
occasions - by an event that led to simultaneous loss of
both the intron and CCT or else functionally replaced
the intron-containing copy, thus allowing it to be lost.
The challenge here is that, as elaborated above, an
intron-lacking copy of the gene is unlikely to have persisted as such - in the same genetic compartment, much
less for so long, and in so many lineages - in the presence of a likely functional intron-encoded endonuclease. Only if the conversion donor/replacement copy
of cox1 were protected from homing-mediated intron
spread by being sheltered in another compartment or
organism should it persist in an intron-less state.
“Another compartment” basically means the nucleus
(which, unlike the chloroplast, typically contains many
mitochondrial sequences; [43]), but a nuclear location is
problematic on two counts: A) the odds of multiple
nuclear-to-mitochondrial transfers of an identical, onein-a-million nuclear sequence, each followed by gene
conversion or replacement, are slim, and B) a nuclear
location of the converting sequence is incompatible with
the mitochondrial-like conservation of cox1 in the Solanoideae (Figures 3 and 4 and Additional File 2) given
that synonymous substitution rates are generally about
20 times higher in the nucleus than the mitochondrion
in plants [36,44] and that a nuclear form of cox1 should
evolve as a pseudogene. “Another organism” means horizontal gene transfer, but this is unlikely because horizontal transfer of an inert, intron- and CCT-lacking

Page 10 of 15

cox1 copy should a priori be less frequent than transfer
of the intrinsically mobile cox1 intron itself, moreover
each transfer would again have to be followed by gene
conversion or replacement.
In summary, it is clear that Brunfelsia jamaicensis
acquired its cox1 intron independently of Mandragora
and Hyoscyameae, and it is likely that these latter two
lineages acquired their introns via independent horizontal transfer events, in which case the intron has been
acquired at least three times during Solanaceae evolution
(Figure 6B). If so, one of the latter two transfers might
have occurred from one lineage of the Solanoideae to the
other because the two clades’ introns are sisters in intron
phylogeny and virtually identical in sequence (Figures 3
and 5, Additional File 2). An intrafamilial transfer in the
Solanaceae would be consistent with evidence from other
studies [9,12], which suggests that intrafamilial transfers
of the cox1 intron in angiosperms may be relatively common compared to phylogenetically broader transfers. Illegitimate pollination or shared vectoring agents may be
responsible for this pattern [6,12].
Rejection of the ancestral-presence/rampant-loss model
of cox1 intron evolution

In a 2008 paper that was largely a reevaluation of the
results and interpretations of two earlier studies by our
group [9,10], Cusimano et al. [15] reached opposite conclusions to these two studies, as well as the current
study. They concluded that “the cox1 intron entered
angiosperms once, has since largely or entirely been
transmitted vertically, and has been lost numerous
times, with CCT footprints providing unreliable signal
of former intron presence.” In an already-lengthy paper
[12] that appeared shortly after Cusimano et al. [15], we
had space to only briefly rebut its conclusions, which we
contended then - and still contend - are based on a seriously flawed interpretation of the extensive incongruence between cox1 intron phylogeny and angiosperm
phylogeny as well as an entirely unrealistic mechanism
to account for putative “loss” of the CCT. We plan to
publish a separate paper presenting a detailed rebuttal
of the interpretations and conclusions of Cusimano et
al. [15]. For now, we will let past studies (by our group
([9,10,12] and by others [8,11]) and, importantly, the
results presented in the current study (in particular,
note the strikingly incongruent intron and exon phylogenies shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively) stand in
rebuttal of Cusimano et al.’s untenable claim that phylogenetic analyses (including their own; see their Figure 4)
of the cox1 intron “are largely congruent with known
phylogenetic relationships” and that the only phylogenetic “finding suggestive of horizontal cox1 intron transfer” is actually poorly supported and instead best
explained by vertical transmission.

Sanchez-Puerta et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:277
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/277

We will, however, confront more explicitly the issue of
CCT evolution, because it is so fundamental to interpretation of the gain/loss history of the intron in the Solanoideae. Cusimano et al.’s all-loss model of cox1 intron
evolution postulates over 100 losses across angiosperms
of the multi-character CCT, with each CCT loss accompanied by intron loss. To account for these many concomitant losses, Cusimano et al. [15] proposed “that the
cox1 coconversion tract is usually lost during the intron
excision process...most likely...by reverse transcriptionmRNA-mediated coconversion.” There is, however, no
published evidence that any reverse transcriptases
engage in co-conversion and, even if they did, the cox1
mRNAs that would mediate this putative co-conversion
would still possess the CCT and therefore the CCT
region would be unaffected. Furthermore, although
plant mitochondrial intron loss is indeed an RNAmediated process, known as “retroprocessing” [45,46],
this would actually lead to a very different set of diagnostic changes in exonic regions immediately following
the site of intron loss, namely, C-to-T substitution at
intron-flanking sites of C-to-U mRNA editing. Importantly, however, this, well-grounded prediction is not
met by the cox1 data, both across angiosperms and
within the Solanaceae. For instance, the many lineages
of intron-lacking Solanaceae (and almost all other
intron-lacking angiosperms) contain C at the closest
RNA edit site to the intron (20 bp downstream of it;
Figure 5), exactly as expected if they never possessed
the intron, and contrary to the T expected if these
genes once had the intron, but lost it via retroprocessing. In contrast, the great majority of intron-containing
taxa possess T at this site (Figure 5 and data not
shown). Finally, the discovery in Cynomorium songaricum of a cox1 gene that lacks the intron but contains a
full length (if not extended) CCT augments two previously reported cases of intron loss unaccompanied by
CCT loss [12] and further argues against the proposal
by Cusimano et al. [3] that retroprocessing somehow
leads to both intron and CCT loss. In short, Cusimano
et al.’s proposed model for CCT loss is both mechanistically implausible and fails to fit any of the observed cox1
data.
Implications of extended co-conversion

Previous studies recognized a short (minimally 3-21 bp)
3’ CCT motif, and no 5’ CCT, in angiosperm cox1 genes
that harbor the homing group I intron in question
[9,10,12,15]. The current study provides the first evidence that 3’ co-conversion in angiosperm cox1 genes
sometimes extends considerably further than this, at
least 35-81 bp downstream of the intron in four different intron clades, and raises the possibility that 5’ coconversion might also occur. In a sense, these results

Page 11 of 15

are not surprising, given experimental studies in such
diverse systems as yeast mitochondria (including the
cognate cox1 intron), Chlamydomonas chloroplasts, and
phage T4, which have shown that CCTs are commonly
hundreds and sometimes thousands of bp in length, and
are often found on both sides of a newly arrived intron
[16,18-20]. More surprising, therefore, is that CCTs
appear to be so short in angiosperm cox1 genes.
Appearances may be deceiving here: the combination of
exceptionally low mutation rates in most plant mitochondrial genomes [34-36,44] and strong constraint on
cox1 sequence evolution [47] results in such high conservation of cox1 sequences, even across angiosperms,
that CCTs of dozens to hundreds of bp in length could
easily go undetected, and probably often do.
That the great majority of intron-containing angiosperms show no evidence of 5’ co-conversion and only
18-21 bp of 3’ co-conversion may be largely a consequence of the crucial horizontal transfer event that first
introduced this intron into angiosperms. Assuming the
donor in this event was a fungus [13,14], then the great
gulf of amino acid divergence between plant and fungal
COX1 proteins may have selected for unusually short
co-conversion, to avoid fixing an inharmoniously chimeric form of this key respiratory protein. If so, then
once the intron commenced spreading rampantly from
one angiosperm lineage to another, most of its co-conversions were probably longer than the short fungal coconversion of most likely 18 or 21 bp on the 3’ side,
thus preserving that motif as the predominant 3’ CCT
among angiosperms. Under this model, the density of
change within the fungal-derived 3’ CCT (i.e., at all 6-7
synonymous sites), together with the polarity of co-conversion (extending from the intron insertion site outward into a flanking exon), yields an asymmetric
expectation for one’s ability to detect short vs. long coconversion. Co-conversions shorter than this wellmarked, 18-21-bp motif will be readily detected, hence
the gradient of 3’-to-5’ shortened CCTs already well
recognized (Figure 5; [9,10,12]). In contrast, co-conversion beyond this motif will usually be difficult if not
impossible to discern, with the various extended 3’
CCTs recognized in this study representing those relatively rare cases in which the donor group happens to
have accumulated enough substitutions in these regions
to generate a reasonably obvious footprint.
Solanaceae intron acquisitions: biogeography and donors

The center of diversity (and most likely the place of origin) of the Solanaceae is in the New World, with a
minimum of 8 dispersal events to the Old World
inferred from phylogenetic studies and overall distribution [48]. Among these events are independent dispersals of the ancestors of both Mandragora and

Sanchez-Puerta et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:277
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/277

Hyoscyameae, whose current distributions are restricted
largely to Eurasia, with a few species found in northern
Africa [42]. The intron-containing clade of Mandragora
is restricted to the Mediterranean-Turanian region,
while the intron-containing clade of Hyoscyameae has a
broader distribution, with two subclades also restricted
to the Mediterranean-Turanian region but other lineages
found in various parts of Asia. Given this, and the very
close relationship between the introns of these two
clades (Figures 3 and 5), it is not unlikely that both
transfer events occurred in the Mediterranean-Turanian
region. The first transfer probably involved a non-Solanaceae donor, while the second may well have occurred
between Hyoscyameae and Mandragora (see first Discussion section). If so, then there is no basis for favoring
transfer in one direction vs. the other. This is because
current estimates of divergence times for the two groups
[42] fail to resolve the relative timing of the two horizontal transfers (Figure 6B). Overlapping geographic distributions and similarities in floral morphology between
Mandragora and Hyoscyameae leave open the possibility
that intron transfer between the two groups occurred
via a shared mycorrhizal associate or pollinator, or by
illegitimate pollination.
The non-Solanaceae donor of the Hyoscyameae/Mandragora intron type is unclear based on intron phylogeny (Figure 3). However, given the relatively long and
well-supported branch leading to the Hyoscyameae/
Mandragora intron clade, and that hundreds if not
thousands of additional intron-containing clades are
likely to be revealed upon sampling the > 99% of unexamined angiosperms, it is not unreasonable to expect
that non-Solanaceae angiosperms with distinctly more
closely related introns will be discovered. Although
intron phylogeny is currently uninformative as to the
Hyoscyameae/Mandragora intron donor, the 3’ exonic
CCT provides important potential clues. These Solanaceae introns share an identical extended CCT (Figure 5)
with only Melia toosendan (Meliaceae) and also both
extant species of Cynomorium among over 200 examined intron-containing angiosperms representing an estimated 80+ intron acquisitions. We therefore predict that
any angiosperms found to contain a more closely related
intron to the Hyoscyameae/Mandragora type will also
have the same, extended CCT. The association with
Cynomorium is intriguing, given the frequent transfer, in
both directions, of mitochondrial genes between parasitic plants and their hosts [3,4,8,41,49,50]. Also, there is
substantial range overlap between the intron-containing
clades of Hyoscyameae and Mandragora and one or
both species of Cynomorium.
Brunfelsia may have acquired the intron quite
recently, as B. jamaicensis is the only one of 7 species
examined in the genus found to possess it. However, in

Page 12 of 15

the absence of any solid estimates of phylogeny and
divergence times for the genus and of comprehensive
sampling of the 40-50 species in the genus, the timing
and location of transfer and the phylogenetic distribution of the intron within the genus are uncertain. It will
be interesting to determine the relationship of B. jamaicensis to the 5 other species of Brunfelsia endemic to
the Caribbean island of Jamaica, none of them yet
sampled, and whether any of them also possess the
intron.

Conclusions
Multiple lines of evidence lead us to conclude that the
cox1 intron was acquired by horizontal transfer on at
least 3 separate occasions during the evolution of the
Solanaceae. One lineage of intron-containing Solanaceae
may have acquired its intron from another lineage in
the family, consistent with previous evidence that horizontal transfer in plants is biased towards phylogenetically local events. Discovery of these transfers was
dependent on extensive sampling of the family. This
underscores the importance of greatly expanded sampling of angiosperms in general in order to gain a deeper understanding of the intron’s evolutionary history,
including not only an accurate estimate of the number
and timing of its many transfers but also to untangle to
the extent possible mechanisms of transfer and donorrecipient relationships for specific transfer events.
Our findings strongly reinforce the idea that the cox1
intron, which encodes a homing endonuclease, is an
exceptionally mobile genetic element in angiosperms.
These results, together with the discovery of a rare case
of likely loss of this intron accompanied by retention of
the CCT, provide still further support for the longstanding, rampant-transfer model for the evolution of
this intron in angiosperms [8-12] and render the rampant-loss model [15] even more implausible than already
regarded.
The identification of exonic co-conversion tracks substantially longer than those previously recognized for
this intron in angiosperms implies that other cox1 coconversions may be longer than realized but obscured
by the exceptional conservation of plant mitochondrial
sequences. This is also consistent with the hypothesis
that the intron’s founding arrival in angiosperms, probably from a fungal donor, was aided by unusually short
co-conversion, thereby minimizing the potentially deleterious effects of creating a chimeric, fungal/plant form
of the key respiratory protein encoded by cox1. The discovery of the cox1 intron in 3 distinct lineages of the
Solanaceae opens the door to experimental, somatic-cell
genetic studies on the transmission and co-conversion
properties of this intron in plants. Cybrids have been
reported between tobacco, which lacks the intron, and

two species in the intron-containing Hyoscyameae clade
[23,51] and may well be feasible with other intron-containing Solanaceae. Somatic crosses should allow one to
test whether the intron is preferentially transmitted relative to other mitochondrial loci, as expected if it does
indeed encode an active homing endonuclease, and to
measure the frequency and length of co-conversion.

Methods
Plant material and DNA extraction

Plant materials were collected by different researchers
from around the world. Seeds of various species were
obtained from the Nijmegen Botanical Garden. Plant
DNAs were either extracted from fresh or dried leaves
using a cetyl-trimethyl-ammonium-bromide DNAextraction protocol [52] or obtained from other sources
(e.g., DNA bank at the Royal Botanical Garden, Kew).
Plant and DNA accession numbers are listed in Additional File 1. To rule out the possibility of DNA contamination or mistaken identity for several key introncontaining species, DNA samples from different sources
were examined for these species (Additional File 1).
Sequence Amplification

To survey the presence/absence of the group I intron in
cox1, a PCR/gel sizing assay was performed using two
primers - cox1-3 (5’-CATCTCTTTYTGTTCTTCGGT3’) and cox1-6 (5’-AGCTGGAAGTTCTCCAAAAGT-3’)
- that amplify most of exon 2 and a small portion of
exon 1, yielding products of either 800 bp (if the intron
is absent) or 1.8 kb (if the intron is present). For
selected species, additional amplifications were done
with primers cox1-1 (5’-AYGAMAAATCYGGTYGATGG-3’) and cox1-4 (5’-ACCGRATCCAGGCAGAATGRG-3’), which amplify most of exon 1 and a
small portion of exon 2, yielding products of either 750
bp or 1735 bp. Selected PCR products were sequenced
using an ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing
primers included PCR primers and two additional primers, both located within the intron: cox1-10 (5’TGACTACTATCAAAGTAGA-3’) and cox1-8 (5’-GTAGAGTCTTATAAGGTAGT-3’). GenBank accession
numbers of sequences determined in this study are
listed in Additional File 1.
Sequence and phylogenetic analyses

Sequences were aligned manually with MacClade 4.0
[53]. Editing sites were predicted using Prep-Mt [54].
Phylogenetic analyses were performed on data sets of
71 cox1 intron sequences and 108 cox1 exon sequences,
all from angiosperms. GenBank accession numbers of
cox1 sequences obtained from NCBI are listed in Additional File 3. Sites of RNA editing (33 in total, see Additional File 2) and the previously described 20-nt CCT

Page 13 of 15

region [12] were excluded from the cox1 exon character
matrix. Maximum likelihood analyses of the intron and
exon data sets were performed with Garli 0.951 [55]
under the General Time Reversible model with parameters for invariable sites and gamma-distributed rate
heterogeneity (GTR+I+Γ4; four rate categories). This
substitution model was supported by hierarchical likelihood ratio tests performed using Modeltest v.3.5 [56].
Ten independent runs were conducted using either the
automated stopping criterion or for up to 5,000,000 generations to ensure convergence to a similar topology and
likelihood score. Five hundred bootstrap replicates were
performed.
Alternative topology test

The approximately unbiased (AU) test was used to test
whether a particular intron-based topology is significantly better than a specified (constrained) alternative
topology. The CONSEL package [37] was used to calculate the approximately unbiased (AU) P values for
unconstrained and constrained trees. Constrained trees
included: A) monophyly of the introns from Hyoscyameae, Mandragora, Melia and Cynomorium, and B)
monophyly of the introns from Brunfelsia jamaicensis,
Hyoscyameae, and Mandragora. The most likely tree
under each constraint was determined by searching for
the best tree compatible with that constraint using
PAUP* [57]. The site likelihoods for this tree and for
the best tree in the unconstrained analysis were
exported from PAUP*, and the AU P values were calculated from these data.
