The Trichoderma harzianum demon: complex
speciation history resulting in coexistence of
hypothetical biological species, recent
agamospecies and numerous relict lineages

Abstract
Background: The mitosporic fungus Trichoderma harzianum (Hypocrea, Ascomycota, Hypocreales, Hypocreaceae) is
an ubiquitous species in the environment with some strains commercially exploited for the biological control of
plant pathogenic fungi. Although T. harzianum is asexual (or anamorphic), its sexual stage (or teleomorph) has
been described as Hypocrea lixii. Since recombination would be an important issue for the efficacy of an agent of
the biological control in the field, we investigated the phylogenetic structure of the species.
Results: Using DNA sequence data from three unlinked loci for each of 93 strains collected worldwide, we
detected a complex speciation process revealing overlapping reproductively isolated biological species, recent
agamospecies and numerous relict lineages with unresolved phylogenetic positions. Genealogical concordance and
recombination analyses confirm the existence of two genetically isolated agamospecies including T. harzianum
sensu stricto and two hypothetical holomorphic species related to but different from H. lixii. The exact
phylogenetic position of the majority of strains was not resolved and therefore attributed to a diverse network of
recombining strains conventionally called ‘pseudoharzianum matrix’. Since H. lixii and T. harzianum are evidently
genetically isolated, the anamorph - teleomorph combination comprising H. lixii/T. harzianum in one holomorph
must be rejected in favor of two separate species.
Conclusions: Our data illustrate a complex speciation within H. lixii - T. harzianum species group, which is based
on coexistence and interaction of organisms with different evolutionary histories and on the absence of strict
genetic borders between them.

Background
The unique nature of fungi, when the closely related
organisms exploit incomparably different strategies for
reproduction (mostly sexual vs. exclusively asexual vs.
sexual and asexual), leads to existence of a variety of
overlapping species concepts. Some fungal species can
be differentiated based on sexual compatibility of their
members, which are in turn reproductively isolated from
the other species (i.e. the biological species concept).
The situation is more complicated with those fungi
which either do not mate in vitro or have lost the ability

to reproduce sexually in nature. In addition, the taxonomy of almost every large group of fungi suffers from
certain historical biases which usually come from the
applied value of the organisms. The introduction of
molecular methods in evolutionary mycology has already
resulted in the dramatic taxonomic changes [1] though
the effort is still needed to rich the clarity for individual
genera. The mitosporic genus Trichoderma (Hypocrea,
Ascomycota, Hypocreales, Hypocreaceae), a fungus beneficially used in agriculture, is a striking example for
this: the number of its morphologically recognized species (i.e. the morphological species concept) is still
around 30 [2-4], while the application of genealogical
concordance between unlinked DNA loci (i.e. the phylogenetic species concept) resulted in 100 phylogenetic

species recognized by 2006 [5] and this number is growing quickly.
The special scientific interest to this genus is largely
connected with the modern pace towards the development of the market for organic farm products, which
already covers approximately 2% of total world farmland
and more than 10% in some European countries such as
Austria, Switzerland and Sweden [6]. The management
of organic farms requires the integration of biological
pest control (biocontrol) in agricultural practices. The
control or prevention of some plant diseases by such
mycoparasitic fungi or ‘biofungicides’ such as Trichoderma is an attractive alternative to the use of chemical
fungicides [7] and therefore is an important component
of modern organic farming. These fungi not only antagonize plant pathogens [8,9], but are also rhizosphere
competent and can enhance plant growth in endophytelike associations [10]. However, as the prerequisite to
applying biofungicides to farm fields, the biology of
every active agent should be understood. Some molecular aspects of Trichoderma mycoparasitism and endophytism - such as the role and regulation of formation
of cell wall hydrolytic enzymes and antagonistic secondary metabolites - have been intensively investigated [8].
On the other hand, the genetic stability of the fungus in
the environment, its population structure, reproduction
strategies and geographic distribution, have received little attention and remain poorly studied.
The asexual (or anamorphic) T. harzianum is the
most familiar Trichoderma species as it is the most frequent Trichoderma sp. in the majority of samples worldwide [11-13]. It has often even been synonymzed with
Trichoderma biocontrol agents in general [14], as it is
the principal component in several commercial biofungicide formulations. Although the biology of T. harzianum has not been studied in detail, it was studied
taxonomically. It was originally defined as a “species
aggregate” [15], but Chaverri et al. [16] reported that it
consists of seven genetic lineages which would fulfil the
basic criteria of cryptic phylogenetic species within a
large morphological species. The latter authors also stated that H. lixii is a teleomorph (sexual stage) of T. harzianum thus raising the probability of genetic
recombination in nature. Despite the detected genetic
polymorphism, the authors proposed the existence of a
single although complex H. lixii/T harzianum species.
However, no more definitive data have been published
on the reproduction, global geographic distribution and
speciation within the H. lixii/T. harzianum.
In this paper we reveal the complex speciation history
within H. lixii/T. harzianum sensu Chaverri et al. [16]
and show that it consists of several hypothetical biological species, some recent agamospecies and numerous
relict lineages with a monophyletic origin altogether.

We also show that T. harzianum sensu stricto and H.
lixii s.s. are genetically isolated and therefore are two
separate species.

Results
Sample set

As a first prerequisite for this study we established a
representative sample set, originally comprising > 300
strains of worldwide origin which were identified as
H. lixii/T. harzianum by the ITS1 and 2 barcode [11]
and diagnostic morphophysiological characteristics
[15,16]. The sample was condensed to 93 strains which
were representative for the total genetic and geographic
variation observed. The final sample set included 10
strains which were collected as Hypocrea teleomorphs
from decaying wood (Table 1), whereas the strains isolated as Trichoderma anamorphs were predominantly
from various soil ecosystems. Representative strains of all
neighbour species (the Harzianum-Catoptron Clade;
[17,18]) were included in order to determine the speciation history within the clade, to set up genetic borders
for morphological H. lixii and T. harzianum species, and
to be used as a negative control for recombination analyses. The spans of the morphological species (separately
considered for teleomorphs and anamorphs) are shown
on the right inset in Figure 1. Species names abbreviations presented in Figure 1 correspond to atrog - H. atrogelatinosa CBS 237.63, tawa - H. tawa CBS 246.63, alni H. alni CBS 120633, aggr - T. aggressivum CBS 433.95,

Detection of phylogenetic species

We screened among five potential phylogenetic markers
for their ability to differentiate within our sample.
Besides the finally analyzed loci the initial set included
exon fragments of RNA polymerase (rpb2) and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1) genes. However,
only three unlinked loci were sufficiently variable intron containing regions of the calmodulin (cal1) and
tef1 genes and the coding fragment of the GH18 chitinase gene (chi18-5). Their nucleotide characteristics are
given in Additional file 1. We analyzed them as a combined dataset as well as individually.
As seen in Figures 1 and 2, all phylograms confirmed
a monophyletic origin for selected 93 strains. Despite
the monophyletic origin, the level of intraspecies genetic
polymorphism (deduced from the branch lengths) within
H. lixii/T. harzianum sensu Chaveri et al. [16] was comparable with that of interspecific variation within the

The application of the genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition concept [19], using the criteria of Dettman et al. [20] (i.e. that a clade is an
independent evolutionary lineage [phylogenetic species]
if it is supported in at least one gene tree and not contradicted in any of the others) identified two distinct
phylogenetic species - one was a clade that contained
the ex-type strain of T. harzianum (hz.07, = CBS
226.95), which is supported by high posterior probabilities (PP) in tef1, cal1 and in the combined phylograms
and not contradicted in the chi18-5 tree (Figures 1 and
2). It includes 15 strains isolated as Trichoderma anamorphs from North America, Europe, Siberia and South
Africa. Because it contains the ex-type strain, we consider it to represent T. harzianum sensu stricto and will
further term it “T. harzianum” throughout the manuscript. The second phylogenetic species, supported with
high significance by all three individual tree topologies,
contains anamorphic strains of tropical, mainly African
origin, and we thus term it T. sp. nov.’afroharzianum
nom. prov.’ (for convenience T. sp. ‘afroharzianum’, Figures 1 and 2).
The ex-type strain of H. lixii (li13 = G.J.S. 97-96),
the putative teleomorph of T. harzianum, occurs in a
large clade (Lixii subclade, Figure 1), which is statistically supported in the combined phylogram. However,
a comparison of individual gene trees (Figure 2)
reveals that this separation is mainly caused by the
chi18-5 topology, whereas it is contradicted in the tef1
and the cal1 trees. Nevertheless, a small subclade,
which includes both teleomorphs and anamorphs from
North America, is supported in the cal1 and tef1 tree

and not contradicted in the chi18-5 tree, and we
therefore consider this holomorphic subclade as a
hypothetical phylogenetic species (H. sp. ‘paralixii
nom. prov.’, Figure 1).
The phylogenetic position of the 14 strains in our
sample isolated as Hypocrea teleomorphs proved to be
diverse. One of European origin (li14) clustered in the
vicinity of H. sp. ‘paralixii’. The other European strains
were found as terminal branches of Subclade III in the
combined phylogram, but this relationship was not supported by individual loci. Two other teleomorph isolates
from Vietnam (X.12) and the USA (X.17) could not be
attributed to any clade either. Three teleomorph isolates
from Cameroon (li07, li08 and li09) formed a supported
terminal clade in the tef1 and cal1 trees, and this was
not contradicted by chi18-5. We ranked them as another
hypothetic phylogenetic species H. sp. “cameroonense
nom. prov.” (Figure 1).
The phylogenetic position of the remaining strains was
discordant in trees derived from single loci. We will use
the term ‘pseudoharzianum matrix’ to specify them
along with hypothetical phylogenetic species throughout
the rest of the paper (Figure 1).
In order to test whether they would be co-specific
with any of the “H. lixii“ lineages identified by Chaverri
et al. [16], we also included the twelve teleomorph
strains investigated by them. The chi18-5 allele was
omitted in this analysis. The results showed that 9 of
these 12 teleomorph isolates also clustered within the
Lixii subclade or in Subclade III (data not shown). Of
the remaining strains, one (G.J.S. 85-119) was found in
Subclade IV, one (G.J.S. 97-106) formed a sister lineage
to T. sp. ‘afroharzianum’ within Subclade IIa, and one

background. Isolates used and results from the PHT test are shown by arrows and the respective P values, ‘rec +’ specifying positive
recombination result and ‘rec -’specifying no recombination detected. The left bottom inset shows the results from the same analysis when
representative strains of the all studied H. lixii/T. harzianum and the representative strains of the Harzianum-Catoptron Clade were also included.
The yellow background separates strains of the ‘pseudoharzianum matrix’. Other symbols are used as above, but no geographic color code is
applied. The right bottom inset shows the recombination network, determined by SplitsTree (NJ mode) from the combined dataset. Taxa with
“harzianum"-like morphology are shown by a light yellow background and dotted lines; other anamorph morphologies are shown by different
colours and dotted lines; individual teleomorph morphologies are indicated by different end symbols. Representative sequences for species from
Harzianum-Catoptron Clade may be retrieved from NCBI Entrez search engine using [species strain locus] keywords.

Recombination between and within T. harzianum, T. sp.
‘afroharzianum’ and strains of the “pseudoharzianum
matrix”

The uneven distribution of teleomorph isolates in the H.
lixii - T. harzianum species complex, particularly their
absence in T. harzianum s.s. and T. sp. ‘afroharzianum’
but their presence in the Lixii subclade, may suggest
that either the tested strains are virtually genetically
identical and likely clonal (= clonal sterility) or that all
teleomorph stains within the sample were completely
reproductively isolated (= interspecific sterility). As these
fungi can not be crossed in vitro, we applied three alternative computational methods for detection of genetic
recombination from sequence data. To this end we used

the T. harzianum strains as a control sample for clonal
sterility and seven representative strains of species from
the Harzianum-Catoptron Clade which were genetically
most distant to H. lixii and T. harzianum as a control
for interspecific sterility.
First, the partition homogeneity test (PHT; [21]) was
used to examine the congruence between gene trees.
This test produces artificial datasets by multiple
(10 000) re-sampling and random swapping of observed
datasets and subsequent construction of maximum-parsimony trees for every newly sampled ‘gene’ sequence.
For clonally reproducing populations (= no sexual
recombination), the sums of the lengths of the gene
trees for the observed and re-sampled data should be
similar. However, under recombination the sums of the
tree lengths should be longer than that for the actual
data because of introduction of homoplasy into unlinked
sites. This test confirmed our analysis of topologies of
single locus trees - the clades containing T. harzianum
and T. sp. ‘afroharzianum’ showed congruence of data

suggesting their clonality (Figure 1). Other clades, which
were incongruent in different trees, provided evidence
for recombination. However, recombination was also
not detected with strains occurring at unresolved positions on the combined tree (X.01 - X.16) including the
ex-type strain of T. inhamatum (X.15 = CBS 273.78)
and two strains isolated as teleomorphs (Figure 1). As
none of these strains fulfilled the criteria of a phylogentic species, we assume that they represent multiple relict
lineages which are incompatible of recombination either
due to the loss of sexuality or due to mating incompatibility evolved in a course of habitat isolation. The relatively long genetic distances between them support this
view. The controls (= representatives of HarzianumCatoptron Clade) produced essentially negative results
(Figure 1, right inset).
As a second means, we used the index of association
(IA) test on a subset of ‘clone corrected’ data (i.e. individuals with identical alleles of the three loci were
excluded so that each haplotype was represented only
once; cf. [22]). In this test, complete panmixia (sexual
compatibility resulting in recombination) would be indicated by a value of 0 (= the null hypothesis). This value
was neither obtained with the complete dataset nor with
any of the individual clades (data not shown). Yet the
Lixii subclade, and Subclades III and IV gave values
lower than 1, thus supporting the null hypothesis of sexual compatibility between strains within them. In contrast T. harzianum and T. sp. ‘afrohazianum’ yielded
values above 1, rejecting the recombination. Subclade V
was not analyzed as it consisted of only two concatenated haplotypes. In accordance with results from PHT,
IA values for strains at unresolved positions (X.01 X.16) also showed no evidence for recombination.

Finally we applied the Phi-test, which uses the pairwise homoplasy index (PHI, Ö) to detect refined incompatibility [23]. This method assumes the infinite sites
model of evolution [24] in which the detection of
incompatibility for a pair of sites indicates recombination. Application of this test to the same subsamples
based on phylogenetic species and clades of the combined tree confirmed the results of the previous analyses, and also detected no recombination in T.
harzianum, T. sp. ‘afroharzianum’ and between representative strains of the Harzianum-Catoptron Clade
(P = 0.1897, P = 0.2773 and P = 0.3406, respectively).
All other subclades showed positive recombination signals (P < 0.05). The corresponding network, produced
by Splitstree, is shown on the inset on the right bottom
of Figure 1.
Since the Phi-test is a very robust means which can
detect recombination even in the presence of recurrent
mutation, we decided to use this method to define the
borders of recombining populations. To this end, we
first set up a non-recombining sample consisting of the
most terminal strains of a clade to be investigated, and
the most distant strains from other phylogenetic species.
Then we gradually added phylogenetically closer strains
until evidence for recombination was detected (P <
0.05). To determine the outer border of the recombining
population, we excluded the first strain which indicated
recombination and started to add phylogenetically more
distant isolates from the same subclade or clade. Such
approach has the advantage that it also allows the analysis of small subclades which can not be analysed alone
due to insufficient data. This technique was applied to
all meaningful combinations of species/clades/subclades
which were present on the phylograms shown (around

Druzhinina et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:94

90 individual tests). The positive results (recombination,
P < 0.05) obtained are shown by shadowed areas on the
main part of Figure 1, and provided interesting insights
into the reproduction history of the clades found. For
example, although the isolates of T. harzianum were
proven to be clonal by all three methods used, they still
revealed a recombination history with strains X.01 X.03 from Northern Africa which occupied an otherwise
unresolved phylogenetic position in the tef1, cal1 and
chi18-5 trees. Another presumably recent agamospecies,
T. sp. ‘afroharzianum’, exhibits a history of recombination with five phylogenetically plesiotypic strains of different geographic origins (Figure 1). Not all strains of
the Lixii subclade showed a recombination history in
this test. Nevertheless two groups with positive recombination signal were detected - one includes strains of H.
sp. ‘paralixii’ and two temperate strains from North
America and Europe; the second covers the latter two
strains, H. sp. ‘cameroonense’ and the ex-type strain of
H. lixii. A limited recombination was also detected for
strains from Subclade III occupying terminal positions three Austrian teleomorphs and two anamorphic strains
isolated from Sardinian soils were recombining with
each other but not with strains occupying basal
branches of the subclade. Similarly, the four terminal
strains from a Subclade IV (all from Africa) display a
history of recombination. In addition, all strains of the
panmictic subclade V showed evidence for recombination. This result corresponds to the fact that they
occupy conflicting positions in the single gene trees but
belong to the same subclade of ech18-5 phylogram indicating their common evolutionary path. The most
genetically polymorphic isolates of the ‘pseudoharzianum matrix’, which formed almost no phylogenetic
structure (Subclade X), showed no evidence for recombination signal when they were confronted either with
each other or with other subclades. However, when
some of them were analysed together with representatives of the Harzianum - Catoptron Clade, a significant
recombination signal was detected indicating traces of
interspecific sexual compatibility (open shadow area on
Figure 1).
Population divergence and stability

To estimate the degree of differentiation within the
‘pseudoharzianum matrix’, we applied methods for analysis of populations and computed the FST values [25] for
the main subclades of the combined phylogram. Qualitatively, an FST value in the range close to 0 indicates low
differentiation (= fixation of characters) between populations (compared populations are composed of equally different individuals) and close to 1 indicates great
differentiation when populations are composed of similar
individuals but there is a big difference between

Page 9 of 14

populations [26]. FST values between T. harzianum and
other subclades were in the range of 0.67 - 0.83 indicating essential genetic separation of this species. The FST
value between Subclades III and IV of the ‘pseudoharzianum matrix’ was low (0.17) which may indicate that
some genetic exchange still occurs between their strains.
The population parameters θ (for haploids 2 Nm,
where N is effective population size and m is the mutation rate per site and generation) and population growth
rates were calculated using LAMARC package (see
Methods). Consistent with the occurrence of H. lixii T. harzinum species complex as one of the most
frequent taxon of the genus, the growth rate of most
subclades is large, which is indicative of a large effective
population size and population expansion (data not
shown). The recombining subclades had the highest
growth rate. Only T. harzianum exhibited a significantly
smaller value for population growth (5.90) and also a 520-fold smaller θ-value than the other subclades. This
suggests that this species apparently occupies a niche
with a limited potential for expansion.

Discussion
The perception of fungal species as dynamic entities
which arise, persist for a longer or shorter period, modify, decline and then become extinct and replaced by
other species leads to a variety of existing species concepts in mycology. In addition, the taxonomy of almost
every large fungal genus is biased either because of its
importance to mankind (e.g. for convenient differentiation of pathogenic or industrial organisms) or by its history of taxonomic description. Here we have analysed
H. lixii - T. harzianum species complex, one of the
most commonly sampled groups of fungi because of its
dominant presence in the majority of soil ecosystems
worldwide and its occupation of a broad diversity of
ecological niches. From the results of this paper, the
evolutionary success of the H. lixii - T. harzianum species aggregate may be attributed to the very complex
structures of the contemporary populations of these
fungi, which can be differentiated into nearly all possible
‘types’ of fungal species: reproductively isolated biological species, sympatric and allopatric phylogenetic species, recent agamospecies and numerous relict lineages
with unresolved phylogenetic positions. This complexity
comes from the fact that many of these species ‘types’
are overlapping and therefore it frequently happens that
two closely related organisms become attributed to different species recognized based on incomparable criteria. Our data illustrate a speciation history within H.
lixii - T. harzianum species complex, which is based on
coexistence and interaction of organisms with different
evolutionary strategies and on the absence of strict
genetic borders between them.

Druzhinina et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:94
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/94

The genealogical concordance phylogenetic species
recognition [GCPSR, [19]] concept is the most advanced
approach to defining species in modern fungal taxonomy. Yet our results demonstrate that even this method
has its limits within a population of isolates with different recombination histories. Basically, the whole of the
H. lixii - T. harzianum species complex might be considered as a single species as its monophyletic origin is
supported by all three loci tested in this paper. Chaveri
et al. [16] used the indistinguishable morphology of
these fungi in favour of such a conclusion. However,
this approach appears to be invalid when T. harzianum
sensu Chaveri et al. [16] is compared with its genetically
closest neighbouring species. The genetic distances calculated within H. lixii - T. harzianum species complex
are comparable to the distances between well diverged
species of the Harzianum-Catoptron Clade, which are
characterized by different phylogenies, morphologies,
physiologies and ecological characteristics [17]. Within
the H. lixii - T. harzianum complex, a conservative
application of the GCPSR concept justifies two anamorphic phylogenetic species (T. harzianum and T. sp.
‘afroharzianum’), and does not contradict postulating
two further holomorphic phylogenetic species (H. sp.
‘paralixii’ and H. sp. ‘cameroonensis’). No consistent
phylogenetic structure could be detected, however, in
the remaining strains.
The results from this work also shed new light on the
concept of the H. lixii/T. harzianum holomorph and the
synonymization of T. inhamatum with T. harzianum.
All methods used clearly differentiated T. harzianum
sensu stricto from the remaining isolates as an agamospecies with global distribution in temperate ecosystems.
Since T. harzianum and H. lixii are genetically isolated
and evidently do not appear in the same life cycle, the
holomorph H. lixii/T. harzianum must therefore be
rejected. Also, the unclear phylogenetic position of the
ex-type strain of H. lixii, and the fact that teleomorphs
with ‘H. lixii’ morphology are also present in subclade
III which is reproductively isolated from H. lixii sensu
stricto, render the naming of most of the isolates investigated here as “H. lixii“ doubtful. Finally, we show that
T. inhamatum is a separate phylogenetic lineage only
distantly related to H. lixii or to T. harzianum, and its
name should therefore be maintained.
Recombination is a powerful evolutionary force that
merges historically distinct genotypes. Yet the extent of
recombination within many organisms is unknown, and
even determining its presence within a set of homologous sequences is a difficult question. Molecular traces
of sexual recombination were detected for the majority
of tested strains and phylogenetic species, and were correlated with the occurrence of most of the teleomorph
isolates within recombining clades. This finding is the

Page 10 of 14

opposite of what has been seen with other apparently
asexual fungi such as the human pathogens Coccidioides
posadasii [27], C. immitis [28] and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis [29], the facultative pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus [22], and the mycotoxin producer A. flavus [30].
In all these cases, teleomorphs were not found, whereas
phylogenetic evidence for recombination was obtained.
In our sample, such a situation was seen only for Subclade V which is composed of evidently recombining
strains exclusively isolated as anamorphs.
In this study, we introduced a trial-and-error approach
to detect borders of recombination within a sample. The
limited distribution of sexual recombination within the
phylogenetic clades underlines that these fungi pass
through periods of sexual and asexual recombination.
Based on the unresolved structure of the “pseudoharzianum matrix” in the individual and combined phylogenetic trees, we originally expected sexual compatibility
between all of its strains. Yet our data showed that distantly related strains from the same subclades had
already lost their ability for genetic exchange. The most
striking example was the absence of recombination
between the H. lixii ex-type strain and two other teleomorphic strains from the same subclade, which further
supports the postulation of H. sp. ‘paralixii’ as a separate
albeit closely related taxon.
With the exception of H. sp. ‘paralixii’ and Subclade
IV (whose isolates were exclusively derived from Africa,
South-East Asia, Australia and New Zealand), all other
clades exhibited a global geographic distribution. While
a worldwide distribution of fungi was at one time
believed to be the rule, the application of molecular
genetic methods has recently shown that most of these
globally distributed taxa actually consist of several allopatric cryptic species. To the best of our knowledge, the
only other similar finding of panmixis for a mitosporic
fungus has recently been presented for A. fumigatus
[22]. The fact that most of the clades detected in this
study could maintain (in part) a panmictic population is
interesting, because it is known (e.g. for insects) that
dispersal and subsequent allopatric speciation can occur
in very short times, even in the absence of severe population bottlenecks [31,32]. This lack of allopatric speciation - which otherwise seems to occur in several other
species of Hypocrea/Trichoderma [cf. [33,34]] - must be
due to a continuous, unrestricted gene flow, whose
mechanism warrants being identified.
T. harzianum sensu Chaveri et al. [16] is one of several Trichoderma species which are successfully used in
biological control of plant pathogenic fungi. The results
from this study show that the respective strains must be
members of one of several phylogenetic species with different recombination frequencies. In a preliminary test
of a few commercially used “T. harzianum“ biocontrol

Druzhinina et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:94
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/94

agents, none of them showed the gene sequences characteristic for the strains from the clonal T. harzianum
and T. sp. ‘afroharzianum’ clades, and therefore may be
members of the recombining populations and phylogenetic species (C.P. Kubicek, unpublished data). Recombination of a biocontrol strain clearly could have a
significant impact on its stability in the field. A study
aiming at clarifying this situation is currently in
progress.
Fungi belonging to ‘pseudoharzianum matrix’ are
abundantly isolated from various environments and are
frequently selected as biocontrol strains. Therefore their
correct identification is of great importance. This study
shows that because some of them are able to recombine
while others are probably sexually incompatible, their
attribution to a single taxon would be very doubtful. We
suggest the introduction of the provisional temporary
name H. sp. ‘pseudoharzianum nom. prov. dub.’ in order
to separate strains belonging to ‘pseudoharzianum
matrix’ from phylogenetic species such as T. harzianum
s.s., T. sp. ‘afroharzianum’, H. lixii s.s. and T. inhamatum, which can be correctly identified by the analysis of
tef1 4th large intron sequence using either the similarity
search tools or phylogeny. The development of an integrated bioinformatic tool for the haplotype-based identification of fungi within H. lixii - T. harzianum species
complex and for the potential prediction of their mycoparasitic abilities has been started in the laboratory of
the corresponding author.

Conclusions
In this work we did not defeat the ‘harzianum demon’.
However, we demonstrated its power, span and perhaps
its limits, and believe that the current study provides
some understanding of the forces driving speciation in
these fungi. A major challenge of future work will be
the elaboration of standardized methods by which the
phylogenetic species and the ‘pseudoharzianum matrix’
detected here can be conveniently differentiated with
predictable biological activities. Preliminary data in our
laboratory showed that the use of 95-carbon source phenotype microarrays may be helpful in this regards
(J. Bissett and I.S. Druzhinina, unpublished data).
Methods
Strains and gene sequences

The strains, sequences and NCBI GenBank accession

long-term storage facilities at Vienna University of
Technology (Austria) and ECORC (Canada) laboratories.
DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing

Mycelia were harvested after 2 - 4 days of growth on
malt extract agar at 25°C and genomic DNA was

Page 11 of 14

isolated using QIAGEN DNeasy® Plant Maxi Kit following the manufacturer’s protocol. Amplification of DNA
fragments comprising ITS1 and 2 and the 5.8S rRNA
gene, the endochitinase chit18-5 (= ech42; [35]) and the
large 4 th intron of tef1, amplicon purification and
sequencing was performed as described in detail previously [36]. Previously published sequences used for
phylogenetic analyses in this study were retrieved from
GeneBank and are identified by their respective accession numbers.
Phylogenetic analyses

For the phylogenetic analysis DNA sequences were
aligned with Clustal X 1.81 [37]. As the 4th large intron
of tef1 is highly polymorphic, the alignment contained
several ambiguous areas which could contain homoplasiuos characters resulted from multiple substitutions
and/or saturation. In order to detect such areas we have
processed the concatenated alignment using the Gblocks
server [[38], URL: http://molevol.cmima.csic.es/castresana/Gblocks_server.html]. When the default stringent
parameters of Gblocks were applied, nearly complete
locus of the tef1 intron has been removed (not shown);
when the less stringent options were used, only 10% of
the alignment was removed leaving the considerable
part of tef1 intron in the analysis (Additional file 2). The
poorly aligned areas of tef1 selected by Gblocks have
been carefully edited manually by inserting extra gap
columns in order to reduce the difference between
sequences originating from hypothetically homoplasious
characters. The original and edited alignments are available from Additional file 3. The possibility of intragenic
recombination, which would prohibit the use of the
respective loci for phylogenetic analysis, was tested by
linkage disequilibrium based statistics as implemented in
DnaSP 4.50.3 [39]. The neutral evolution of coding fragments (cal1 and chi18-5) was tested by Tajima test
implemented in the same software. The interleaved
NEXUS files were formatted using PAUP*4.0b10 [40].
The best nucleotide substitution model for the each
locus was determined using jMODELTEST [41]. As
Akaike and Bayesian Information criteria (AIC [42] and
BIC [43], respectively) selected different nucleotide substitution models for every locus and due to the relatively
small size of individual datasets (1379 characters per
107 sequences for the biggest) the unconstrained GTR +
I + G substitution model was applied to all sequence
fragments (Additional file 1). Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling was performed using MrBayes v. 3.0B4 with two simultaneous
runs of four incrementally heated chains that performed
5 million generations. The length of run (number of
generations) for each dataset was determined using
AWTY graphical system [44] to check the convergence

Druzhinina et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:94
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/94

of MCMC. Bayesian posterior probabilities (PP) were
obtained from the 50% majority rule consensus of trees
sampled every 100 generations after removing the first
trees using the “burnin” command. Number of discarded
generations was determined for every run based on
visual analysis of the plot showing generation versus the
log probability of observing the data. According to the
protocol of Leache and Reeder [45] PP values lower
than 0.95 were not considered significant while values
below 0.9 are not shown on the resulting phylograms.
Phylograms calculated based on alignments trimmed in
Gblocks are given in Additional file 4. The phylogenetic
tree inferred based on the complete corrected alignment
was used for the data interpretation. Model parameters
summaries after MCMC run and burning first samplings
as well as nucleotide characteristics of used loci are collected in Additional file 1.
Detection of Recombination

The congruence or incongruence of the three gene genealogies was used to infer recombination between isolates, thereby excluding isolates of the “sensu stricto“
group (see Results). To this end, three different tests
were employed: the incongruence length difference/partition homogeneity test (ILD/PHT) [21,46] using a score
of P < 0.05 to reject the null hypothesis of congruence
between loci; the Index of Association [IA; [47]] test, in
which the data were compared to the IAs of artificially
recombined datasets [27,48]; and the Phi-test implemented in SplitsTree, which uses the pairwise homoplasy
index, PHI (= F) statistic, to detect refined incompatibility indicating recombination [23].
In addition we applied split decomposition implemented in the SplitsTree program, version 4.0 [49], using
pairwise distances under the Kimura 3-ST model [24].
This method visualizes recombination events by depicting the shortest pathway linking sequences, rather than
forcing them into a bifurcating tree [49].
Population divergence and stability

Population growth parameters and theta (θ) values were
inferred using the program LAMARC 2.0 [50]. All polymorphic sites were used to assess the population parameters. To estimate the population growth parameter,
we used 10 initial chains with 2,000 genealogies sampled
and two final chains with 20,000 genealogies sampled.
Population parameters were inferred using both Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood criteria.
