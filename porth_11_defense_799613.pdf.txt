Defense mechanisms against herbivory in Picea:
sequence evolution and expression regulation of
gene family members in the phenylpropanoid
pathway
Ilga Porth1,2, Björn Hamberger2, Richard White3 and Kermit Ritland1*

Abstract
Background: In trees, a substantial amount of carbon is directed towards production of phenolics for
development and defense. This metabolic pathway is also a major factor in resistance to insect pathogens in
spruce. In such gene families, environmental stimuli may have an important effect on the evolutionary fate of
duplicated genes, and different expression patterns may indicate functional diversification.
Results: Gene families in spruce (Picea) have expanded to superfamilies, including O-methyltransferases,
cytochrome-P450, and dirigents/classIII-peroxidases. Neo-functionalization of superfamily members from different
clades is reflected in expression diversification. Genetical genomics can provide new insights into the genetic basis
and evolution of insect resistance in plants. Adopting this approach, we merged genotype data (252 SNPs in a
segregating pedigree), gene expression levels (for 428 phenylpropanoid-related genes) and measures of
susceptibility to Pissodes stobi, using a partial-diallel crossing-design with white spruce (Picea glauca). Thirty-eight
expressed phenylpropanoid-related genes co-segregated with weevil susceptibility, indicating either causative or
reactive effects of these genes to weevil resistance. We identified eight regulatory genomic regions with extensive
overlap of quantitative trait loci from susceptibility and growth phenotypes (pQTLs) and expression QTL (eQTL)
hotspots. In particular, SNPs within two different CCoAOMT loci regulate phenotypic variation from a common set
of 24 genes and three resistance traits.
Conclusions: Pest resistance was associated with individual candidate genes as well as with trans-regulatory
hotspots along the spruce genome. Our results showed that specific genes within the phenylpropanoid pathway
have been duplicated and diversified in the conifer in a process fundamentally different from short-lived
angiosperm species. These findings add to the information about the role of the phenylpropanoid pathway in the
evolution of plant defense mechanisms against insect pests and provide substantial potential for the functional
characterization of several not yet resolved alternative pathways in plant defenses.

Background
Lignin, the structural component of land plants, is a heteropolymer of coupled phenylpropanoid monomers
derived from hydroxycinnamyl alcohols; it is also the
second most abundant biopolymer after cellulose on
earth. In gymnosperms, 30% of wood dry weight is lignin, in angiosperms this value is up to 25% ([1,2]).

Lignocellulosic polymers are the dominant carbon sink
in forest ecosystems and account for approximately 20%
of the terrestrial carbon storage [3]. In addition, the
phenylpropanoid pathway synthesizes a plethora of specialized plant products (anthocyanins, flavonoids, condensed tannins, stilbenes, soluble and cell wall-bound
phenolics, and other polyphenols) with protective functions (antioxidant [4], radical scavenging [5], stress
induction [6], UV [7], flavonoids and UV tolerance
[8,9]). The biosynthesis of those phenylpropanoids
involves intricate networks [10] as shown by the KEGG

involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis exhibit an
expansion and diversification in comparison to shortlived annuals [14], suggesting diversification of chemical
defense strategies. The limited number of phenylpropanoid pathway genes functionally characterized in gymnosperm species include those involved in angiosperm
lignin biosynthesis (peroxidases: Picea abies [15], Omethyltransferases: Pinus taeda [16], P. sylvestris [17], P.
radiata [18], hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase: P. radiata [19], and MYB: P.
taeda: [20]).
Constitutively present phenolics have high priority as
defenses against bark-boring insects in long-lived conifers, but pre-formed defenses are regarded costly for the
plant since “assimilates” are diverted. This impacts

pathways http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/map/
map00940.html.
The importance of specialized phenolic compounds
for plant chemical defense has been the subject of intensive study in angiosperms ([11,12]), however, knowledge
in gymnosperm lineages is sparse. In general, phenolics
participate in pre-formed defenses (toxins, cell wall associated compounds) as well as in active defense reactions
(antimicrobial phytoalexins). Biosynthesis occurs
through a limited number of metabolic pathways (Figure
1A), however, the extreme structural diversity of compounds found so far (Figure 1B) is due to biosynthetic
enzymes that belong to multi-member gene families.
Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and its genetic basis has

growth rate and reproduction [21]. Our previous findings (unpublished and [22]) already reflected the biochemical link between growth and established
(constitutive) defenses in this important metabolic
pathway.
Conifers have extremely large genomes (ca. 20 billion
bases), which largely consist of repetitive elements
([23,24]), but the enormous size of conifer genomes is
also likely due to complex gene families that have been
significantly enlarged from angiosperm ancestors. These
families have structural and regulatory functions related
to defense/resistance mechanisms against pests and
pathogens (including terpene synthases, cytochromes
P450, TIR-NBS-LRR genes, pathogen-resistance genes
and dirigents [25-29]). Those multigenic families
resulted from duplications of genes that further
diverged.
In the plant kingdom, angiosperms are well studied
compared to ancient lineages such as mosses, ferns, or
gymnosperms [30]. Therefore, we must rely upon
known and characterized candidates from angiosperms
to gain insight into the evolution of sequence orthologs
of conifer phenylpropanoid-like genes. This involves evidence for neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization or
neo-subfunctionalization within gene families. Gene
duplication is recognized as an important mechanism
for adaptive evolution in plants [31]. Duplication allows
“neofunctionalization” or the retention of ancestral function by one gene and the origin of new functions by the
second gene. Likely, the novel gene function adopted by
one copy of the duplicated genes, which now determines
their functional differences, is co-opted from a secondary ancestral property already present before the duplication event [32]. The fate of specialized terpene
synthases in spruce is one well-studied example that
exemplifies how neo-functionalizations account for
functional plasticity in a multi-gene family [33].
Another mechanism for maintenance of gene duplicates involves gene conservation using gene-dosage
effects and functional redundancy [34]. Moreover, loss
of genes and regulation of gene activity through transcript accumulation are other important aspects to consider in gene evolution. Phylogenetic trees are robust for
prediction of orthologous genes in the presence of gene
losses and varying rates of evolution among the sampled
taxa [35]. Hence, in our study of multi-gene families in
spruce we employed phylogenetic reconstruction to
facilitate gene annotations.
In the present work, we determined the extent of gene
co-expression by correlation analysis for 428 EST microarray elements (Additional File 1). The analysis included
a number of multi-gene families originating from 26
biosynthetic genes, three structural genes related to the
phenylpropanoid pathway, transcription factors NAC

and myb (of which few have been characterized as key
regulators of secondary wall biosynthesis and phenylpropanoid metabolism [36,37]), and SAMS (a key enzyme
for methylation reactions which are also important in
lignin formation [38]) (Additional File 1).
The same ESTs were studied by means of “genetical
genomics” to investigate the genetics of defense
mechanisms of white spruce against the white pine weevil (Pissodes strobi). Genetical genomics [39] combines
gene expression with genotyping to map quantitative
trait loci (QTL) for gene expression. This new approach
to the study of quantitative genetics allows rapid and
direct discovery of genes underlying a trait of interest
("positional candidate genes”) or genes closely regulated
with the QTL by “genetic co-localization” (co-segregation of transcript variation of genes with the phenotypic
trait of interest). For example, due to the genetic as well
as environmental and developmental sources of variation, transcript level variation at a gene locus underlying
a QTL is highly associated with the total phenotypic
variation in the actual quantitative trait [38]. Hence, in
systems where the environment shows a strong effect
on the phenotype, this approach has advantages over
conventional QTL analysis with low resolution that
further necessitates positional gene cloning [38].

Results
Genetical Genomics Reveals Candidate Genes for Weevil
Resistance and Genomic Regions with Regulatory
Hotspots

In the present study we merged genetics and transcriptomics [40,41] to better understand weevil resistance in
spruce, an important phenotypic trait that defines the
life history of this economically valuable perennial plant
organism. Gene expression variation represents the phenotype most directly related to DNA sequence polymorphism, such that in principle each transcript has a
corresponding gene with known position in the genome
[42]. Genetical genomics allows assaying thousands of
these gene expression traits simultaneously and thus
provides data on a large and unbiased set of traits (ibidem); these ‘expression phenotypes’ are then accessible
to standard QTL analysis. Using the gene expression
traits obtained from our transcriptome study we
achieved fine scale phenotyping that was merged with
phenotyping of the conventional traits. This allowed us
to identify positional candidate genes for any phenotypic
variation by testing for co-segregation of markers with
gene expression, individual resistance traits, or the composite trait represented by all sampled defense traits
(see below). This way, we found certain members of
complex gene families within the phenylpropanoid
metabolic pathway individually associated with weevil
resistance.

We used the experimental setup as presented in Figure 2. Plant material was harvested - as outlined in the
Methods section - from the progeny of resistant-femaleby-susceptible-male crosses, which showed wide segregation for weevil resistance and had shared parentage
([43]). Thus, cross 26 of ♀PG87*♂PG165, cross 27 of
♀PG87*♂PG117, cross 29 of ♀PG21*♂PG165 and cross
32 of ♀PG21*♂PG117 forming the partial diallel were
chosen for further analysis. The plant material used for
expression profiling (bark tissue from tree leaders) was
harvested in a randomized fashion to minimize bias due
to the sampling procedure. DNA from an expanded
mapping population (417 individuals in total) was genotyped using a custom-built 384 multiplexed SNP chip.
This information was used to estimate pairwise recombination rates between SNP loci and subsequently construct the framework genetic linkage map for localizing
the QTLs (Additional Files 2 and 3). Phenotypic information for QTL analysis was obtained from (a) tree
height, (b) weevil attack, (c) oviposition, and (d) transcriptomics data. Measures were taken for the initial
tree height in 1995, and heights in years three and five
as well as leader length in year five preceding the artificial augmentation of the local weevil population in

2001 were classified as successful top kills, failure to kill
the leader, and no attack. For the same years, egg counts
along the leaders were summarized into five discrete
classes. Comprehensive information about these measures can be found in Additional File 4. In the transcriptomics experiment a two color 21.8 k spruce EST array
was employed for gene expression profiling in the partial
diallel progeny. A distant pair design that maximized
direct comparisons between different alleles at each
locus [41] was modified for outbred individuals (Additional File 5). Signal intensities can be found under the
GEO accession number GSE22116. We used the signal
intensity at each EST spot for the following analyses: (a)
generation of expression QTLs (eQTLs) and (b) establishing a co-expression network. In the latter the genegene interactions were assessed. Specifically, a Gaussian
model and a shrinkage method were employed to evaluate direct gene connections (see Methods). QTLs were
mapped in the diallel progeny using a likelihood function to assess the phenotype effect conditional on genotypic variation. A QTL was significant at LOD≥3.84
(Additional Files 6 and 7). A goodness-of-fit test assuming a uniform distribution was performed to test

whether the observed frequencies of eQTLs along the
linkage map differed significantly from the expected
value. Following the rejection of this null hypothesis
“eQTL hotspots” signified eQTL clusters with ≥38
eQTLs at a given locus. Positional candidate genes were
identified by collocation of at least 40% of their eQTLs
with phenotypic trait QTLs based on the criteria for
identifying significant QTLs (10,000 randomizations, p ≤
0.05). The positional candidate genes for the general
‘resistance’ trait were identified based on strong collocations of gene expression variation with all six studied
resistance traits (see Material and Methods).
Expression variation from 428 gene spots generated
4,221 significant eQTLs (LOD ≥ 3.84). Figure 1A shows
the phenylpropanoid pathway, gene families from the
core branch as well as related families; data relevant for
this study are found in Additional File 1. Phenylpropanoid pathway-linked genes that showed strong association with the general ‘resistance’ phenotype were:

SAMS, one ADT-like gene (PicglADTL8, Figure 3), an
annotated spruce CYP750 (C24, Additional File 8), and
a member with similarity to LAR. An additional 34 phenylpropanoid-related candidate genes were identified
based on significant co-segregation with individual weevil resistance traits such as attack rates and oviposition
estimates: transcription factors (seven putative mybs and
one putative NAC), putative members of the upstream
shikimate pathway (DAHP and DHQD-SD), one putative PAL, two annotated CHS as well as one STS, two
OMTs from group C and one from group D (OMTL),
two P450s (CYP75/F3’H and CYP750, respectively),
three different representatives of phenylpropanoid
reductases (PCBER, PLR and IFR), one DIR (f-family),
six PRXR (including the stress inducible PicabPRX2
orthologue), two putative LACs, one putative catecholO-methyltransferase and two genes with similarity to
LAR. Most associations were found for weevil susceptibility measured in the year 2000 and for both years

2000 and 2001. No dedicated monolignol biosynthetic
gene co-segregated extensively with any resistance trait.
However, 29 genes from our gene set were associated
with individual height growth traits (predominantly tree
height measures taken in 1999 preceding the artificially
enforced weevil attacks), Additional File 1. As many as
11 peroxidases co-segregated with growth traits, among
them several genes which are implied in lignin polymerization by radical coupling of the monolignols. Their coexpression pattern with other phenylpropanoid-related
genes is shown in Figure 4.
We superimposed at a given SNP marker pQTL maps of
individual phenotypic traits and counts of significant
eQTLs from the studied gene set (Figure 5). We found
regulatory hotspots comprising multiple pQTLs and
accumulated eQTLs. Along this QTL density map, eight
loci represented hubs of trans-eQTLs, which also corresponded with at least three pQTLs: four loci were associated exclusively with resistance QTLs, and each two
loci with growth QTLs and QTLs from individual traits
of both growth and resistance, respectively (Figure 5).
The composition of those eQTL hotspots with extensive
pQTL overlap is given in Additional File 9.

Page 6 of 26

Since the phenylpropanoid pathway proved to be
important in insect resistance, we looked at the representation of individual branches within the pathway as
well as individual gene families among those regulatory
hotspots that were associated with pQTLs. We have
summarized the average number of detected eQTLs per
gene family as well as gene families whose members
have eQTLs at a minimum of two regulatory hotspots
with pQTL association (Additional File 10 and Figure
6). Specifically, we compared members from transcription factors myb and NAC, the shikimate pathway, PAL,
C4H and 4CL (main branch of the phenylpropanoid
pathway), and gene families that are involved in the biosynthesis of various secondary compounds as well as lignin and lignans, respectively (Additional File 10).
Among all pathway branches, the branch of the phenylpropanoid pathway that is directly involved in the biosynthesis of the secondary compounds generated on
average the highest number of eQTLs, whereas the shikimate pathway generated the lowest number of eQTLs
on average. Also, the transcription factors followed by
the pathway branch that is directly related to lignin/lignan biosynthesis contributed on average the most

OMTs from group C as well as both AEOMT genes, the
lignin-forming genes PiglCCoAOMT3, PicabPRX1 and
PicabPRX18 orthologs and the stress inducible PicabPIPRX gene, and the P450s that are involved in a wide
range of derivatization reactions (CYP75/F3’H, CYP750,
F3’5’H/F3H and C4H class, respectively), Additional File
9. The DIR gene family members had eQTLs predominantly associated with growth trait QTLs (Figure 6) that
were mainly representatives of the f-family (Additional
File 9).
Although most spruce gene markers used to build our
framework linkage map lack consistent annotations
(67% using TAIR7, 54% using Viridiplantae databases
gave no hits), Additional File 2, for the few loci that are
potential gene expression regulators located within
eQTL hotspots and affect highly complex phenotypes,
we further infer their putative gene function in spruce.
For example, the growth trait associated locus on LG13
with accumulated eQTLs from 49 array elements (Figure 5) represents a glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)
gene. GAD catalyzes gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
synthesis via decarboxylation from the amino acid glutamate. The regulation of GAD enzyme activity is vital for
normal plant development, and is accomplished by calcium/calmodulin binding to the specific CaM domain of
GAD allowing the plant to respond to various external
stimuli [44]. Recently, the locally enhanced production
of GABA in the plant was shown to be connected with
a deterrence reaction of the host responding to herbivore attack [45]. Two loci that encode bona fide
CCoAOMT genes (CCoAOMT-1, CCoAOMT-2) on
LG6 represented eQTL hotspots that overlapped with
QTL regions for various resistance traits (Figure 5). At
the two different CCoAOMT loci a common set of
pQTLs (i.e., atk_2000, egg_2000 and sum_egg) as well
as eQTLs (generated by 24 members of 11 different
gene families) clustered. Most prominently the following
gene families were involved: PRXR (PicabPRX18, e.g.),
DIR (PgeDIR13, a-family; PicsiDIR31, PicsiDIR27, ffamily), OMT (AEOMTs PicglOMT-17 and PicglOMT18; PgOMT-35, clade II), myb (TT2 orthologue, e.g.)
and ADT (PicglADT3, PicglADT4), Additional File 9.
Both CCoAOMT genes have also cis-eQTLs (Additional
File 9) that likely represent promoter polymorphisms
involved in the differential expression of the genes. Our
finding of cis-eQTLs connected by extensive trans-regulatory interactions describes an example of epistasis that
is commonly observed in the regulation of pathway biosynthetic genes [46].
Arogenate Dehydratase and Related Sequences

While arogenate dehydratase activity was first detected
in Nicotiana sylvestris [47], gene cloning and functional
characterization was only recently reported in Petunia

hybrida [48]. Five putative white spruce arogenate dehydratases (ADT) were identified with similarity to characterized bacterial and fungal prephenate dehydratase
(PD). They group together with A. thaliana and P.
hybrida (Figure 3) implied in the catalysis of the last
step of the shikimate pathway specific for the biosynthesis of phenylalanine (the entry molecule for the core
phenylpropanoid pathway) (Figure 1). In addition, eight
ADT-like white spruce genes fall into two more remote
clusters of the small family (Figure 3).
Four ADT genes as well as six ADT-like genes were
represented as elements on our microarray. The ADTlike gene PicglADTL8 was identified as positional candidate for the general resistance phenotype per se, Additional File 1. In the co-expression network three ADTs
(PicglADT2 WS00810_A15, PicglADT3 WS00921_B18,
and PicglADT4 WS0261_E23) as well as one ADT-like
(PicglADTL7 WS00937_M15) were present ("PD”,
PD_4, PD_6, PD_12 and PD_9, respectively; Figure 4).
Despite the central importance of ADT in generating
the precursor molecule phenylalanine, ADTs were positioned at the edges of long-range subgraphs in genegene interactions, Figure 4 (8), (12). PicglADT3 was significantly co-expressed with a class II 4CL gene
WS01010_M10 (4CL_11), see below (Figure 4 (8), supporting its function as ADT. Expression of PicglADT2 is
negatively correlated with the cluster of constitutive dirigents of the f and b/d class (DIR_2, DIR_32, DIR_31,
DIR_20, DIR_18), Figure 4 (12). The ADT-like PicglADTL7 was co-expressed with OPCL PicglACL10
(Figure 4, 4CL_3 WS00729_F23) suggesting both genes
act in a related pathway.
4-Coumarate:CoA-Ligase (4CL) and Related Acyl CoA
Ligases (ACL)

In the biosynthesis of lignin, soluble and wall bound
phenolics and flavonids, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL;
EC 6.2.1.12) plays a gate keeper role as the enzyme generates not only the CoA ester of coumaric acid in the
last step of the core phenylpropanoid pathway (Figure
1), but the higher substituted coumarate derivatives,
such as caffeic acid, ferulic acid and 5-hydroxyferulic
acid, and sinapic acid in some angiosperms as well. 4CL
is part of a family of adenylate-forming enzymes present
in all organisms, including an Arabidopsis gene recently
shown to encode a functional 3-oxo-2(2’-[Z]-pentenyl)cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid (OPC-8) CoA ligase
(OPCL) catalyzing an essential step in jasmonic acid
biosynthesis [49,50]. The 4CL gene family is moderately
sized [14] and shows four bona fide 4CL genes for
spruce (Figure 7). Three white spruce 4CL candidates
clustered closely with Arabidopsis 4CL3 (involved in flavonoid biosynthesis) and one spruce gene was found
orthologous to loblolly pine 4CL1 (for which a role in

implied) (Figure 7) [51,52]. In the context of adenylateforming acyl-CoA ligases, 11 white spruce candidates
fell into four divergent clusters, out of which four closely grouped with the Arabidopsis OPCL, indicating a
similar function (Figure 7). While this represents a large
subfamily, our knowledge about the function of the
members is limited.
Of 13 array elements with similarity to acyl-CoA
ligase genes, three represent sequence orthologs of
bona fide 4CL genes, while ten elements have higher
similarity to oxo-pentenyl-cyclopentane (OPCL), Additional File 1 and Figure 7. Two spruce 4CL genes
(Picgl4CL3
WS00112_J15
and
Picsi4CL2
WS01010_M10) were present in our co-expression

network, Figure 4. They represent spruce classII 4CL
genes, which are involved in the formation of flavonoids and soluble phenolics. Picgl4CL3 (4CL_1) was
directly co-expressed with two positional candidates
for resistance traits (Picsi-PKS22 WS0014_M21 and
LAR WS00929_C24), Figure 4 (1). Picsi4CL2 (4CL_11)

(CCoAOMT, and laccases implicated in constitutive
lignifications [53]) along with the presence of other
gene family members such as those involved in defense
mechanisms like dirigents (a-family), P450s, polyketide
synthases and phenylpropanoid reductases (see also

CCoAOMT Superfamily, Related to Caffeoyl-CoA OMethyltransferase

Caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT, EC
2.1.1.104) catalyses O-methylation of the hydroxyl group
at the C3 position of the phenolic ring in conversion of
caffeoyl-CoA to feruloyl-CoA (Figure 1) and has been
characterized in many plants, including loblolly pine,
where it is associated with developmental lignification
[54]. Three white spruce genes are closely related with a
loblolly pine CCoAOMT in the clade of bona fide
CCoAOMT (Figure 8). The diversity observed in the
white spruce CCoAOMT clade is the result of lineagespecific gene duplications that were retained throughout
evolution.

All three genes involved in monolignol biosynthesis
were absent from the co-expression network. However,
PicglOMT1, the spruce specific remote OMT
(CCOMTL) (Additional File 11) that is putatively
involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism and a positional candidate for Ht_1997 growth trait (Additional
File 1), was represented by two array spots
(IS0014_O19, WS0022_P17) in the network. These two
genes termed CCoAOMT_1 and CCoAOMT_2 were
directly connected to transcription factors (NAC_10
WS00911_P24 and myb_5 WS00716_G01, respectively)
as well as to a putative shikimate EPSPS synthase
WS0085_B05, Figure 4 (1). Furthermore, two catecholO-methyltransferase-like genes WS0107_O19 and
WS01013_K15 (Additional File 1) resided at the edges
of the network (CCoAOMT_9, CCoAOMT_8, Figure 4):

below and Additional File 1), while the second, a positional candidate for the egg_2001 resistance trait, connected to genes with unknown functions. The
phylogeny for said catechol-O-methyltransferase (-like)
sequences suggests they are ubiquitous genes that lack a
counterpart in modern/angiosperm plants (Additional
File 12) and are part of a yet to be elucidated pathway
in conifer defenses.
Polyketide Synthases Related to Chalcone and Stilbene
Synthases (CHS/STS)

Stilbene synthase (STS, EC 2.3.1.95) and chalcone
synthase (CHS, EC 2.3.1.74) are plant-specific polyketide
synthases at the entry of stilbenoid and flavonoid biosyntheses, respectively (Figure 1). Both types of enzymes
perform a sequential condensation of three acetate units
to a CoA-ester to form an intermediate that is folded
into the aromatic ring systems of naringenin chalcone
or the stilbene backbone [55,56]. While flavonoids,
which play a vital role as UV protective pigments in
plants, are ubiquitous in the land plant kingdom and
were reported in the basal lineages of liverworts and
mosses [57], stilbenes have so far been detected in relatively few plant families where they contribute to the
resistance of woody tissues to degradation and act as
phytoalexins. The main constitutive stilbene glycosides
in Picea species are astringin and isorhapontin [58].
Fourteen spruce CHS-like sequences form a tight cluster
with the Japanese red pine CHS, indicating several
duplications of functionally related polyketide synthases
(Figure 9). While the ancestor of modern polyketide
synthases predates the evolution of gymnosperms and
angiosperms, the close relationship of STS and CHS
within the angiosperms and gymnosperms indicates that
these functions evolved independently several times. In
gymnosperms distinct clades of both pine and spruce
orthologues are found for STS and for CHS, consistent
with the presence of both functions in a common ancestor of these lineages.
Strong collocation of gene expression and trait variation identified two CHS genes Picsi-PKS21 and PicsiPKS22 as well as the STS gene Picgl-PKS6 as potential
candidates for weevil resistance traits (sum_egg,
egg_2001 and egg_2001, respectively), Additional File 1.
Picsi-PKS22 WS0014_M21 is present within the network (CHS_1) and co-expressed with Picgl4CL3 and a
peroxidase WS0063_P06 that co-segregated with the
sum_atk resistance trait (Figure 4 (1)). Picgl-PKS6
WS00925_G22, (CHS_11, Figure 4 (5)) was negatively
co-expressed with peroxidase PicsiPRX2 WS0074_A10
that responded to wounding ([59]). The CHS gene
WS0024_K18 (termed CHS_3) from the Picsi-PKS14

Page 11 of 26

cluster is associated with a myb transcription factor
(myb_32, Figure 4 (3)).
Picgl-PKS2 WS00731_E22 (see also Figure 9) was
negatively co-expressed with a-family dirigent PgeDIR2
WS00911_I09 (Figure 4 (11), CHS_8 and DIR_10). The
expression of PgeDIR2 was significantly triggered by
insect feeding [29], see below. Interestingly, Picgl-PKS2
was co-expressed with an ANAC057 transcription factor
WS00929_E05 (NAC_14, Figure 4 (11)) that accumulated with increasing growth rate (unpublished). The
contrasting expression pattern found for diverse members of the polyketide synthase gene family reflects the
differential gene regulation for individual members.
O-Methyltransferase Superfamily, Related to Caffeic Acid/
Coniferaldehyde O-Methyltransferase (COMT)

A total 37 of OMT/COMTL candidates were identified
in white spruce through mining of the Treenomix EST
database (Spruce V8 database will be published elsewhere, K. Ritland, pers. com.), relative to 17 genes in
Arabidopsis, eight in poplar, and six in rice (Figure 10).
The founding members of the O-methyl transferase
superfamily (OMT, EC 2.1.1.6) involved in the synthesis
of methylated plant phenolics are related to the formation of the angiosperm monolignol precursor of S-lignin.
However, the S-lignin pathway and sinapic acid-derived
metabolites, such as syringyl lignins, are absent in gymnosperms (Figure 1). Even though they are broadly
represented in the OMT/COMTL superfamily, evidence
for dedicated bona fide COMT orthologues in white
spruce is missing.
OMTs were among phenylpropanoid gene families
most completely represented in the co-expression network (Figure 4). Three COMTLs (PicglOMT-11
WS00715_G04/WS0261_F17,
PicglOMT-10
WS0023_M11, PicglOMT-7 WS02611_F21) similar to
the stress inducible O-methyltransferase from scots pine
([17]; clade I, Figure 10 and 11) were highly coexpressed, OMT_5, OMT_21, OMT_22, OMT_1, Figure
4 (2). Their expression was negatively correlated with
the expression of a sequence (WS00716_K11) that
shares similarity to AtPER16/AtPER45 and is a positional candidate for the Hgt1999 trait (Additional File
1). Five spruce OMTs (WS0071_H13, WS0078_K09,
WS0104_J07, WS0046_C03, and WS01013_K11) that
are part of the lineage specific clade in the plant OMT/
COMTL superfamily (Figure 10) cluster within the network (OMT_4, OMT_10, OMT_19, OMT_3, and
OMT_18, Figure 4 (3)) and were co-expressed with a
transcription factor that weakly resembles the secondary
wall-associated AtMYB83 (WS0079_B12). PicglOMT-1
WS0099_A18, with strong similarity to a beta-alanine
betaine synthase (clade III, Figure 10 and 11), represents
a positional candidate for the egg_2000 trait and is co-

is based on phylogenetic analysis alone, and biochemical
characterization needs to support the annotation, spruce
genes of the OMT/COMTL superfamily possibly extent
the repertoire of spruce defense mechanisms.
Cytochrome P450s Involved in Oxygenation of
Phenylpropanoids

In addition to a major plant carbon sink - the lignin
biosynthesis - cytochromes P450 contribute to the biosynthesis of many bioactive phenolic derivatives (for a

review see [60]). In the families of the cinnamte hydroxylase (C4H, CYP73) and coumaroyl-shikimate 3’-hydroxylase (C3’H, CYP98) two and one white spruce
candidate were identified, corresponding to single genes
in Arabidopsis, while no white spruce coniferylaldehyde
5-hydroxylase (CA5H, CYP84) sequence orthologues
were found. In the CYP75 family, seven diverse white
spruce candidates form two distinct clusters with the
Arabidopsis CYP75B1 encoding a functional F3’H [61].
Phylogenetically related, but without biochemical function assigned, 45 white spruce candidates constitute the
unusual large and diverse conifer specific CYP750

families and CYP750s may share a common progenitor
and possibly a structurally similar substrate of the phenylpropanoid class. On our array 11 spruce specific
CYP750 genes were represented (Additional File 1), one
CYP750 (C24) was identified in our study as a positional
candidate for the weevil resistance phenotype per se, and
three CYP750s (C18, C12 and C56) are found in the coexpression network. C18 (F5H_5, WS00934_G23) was
co-expressed with a candidate (LAR similarity, DFR_3)
for the general resistance phenotype (Figure 4 (7)). C12
(F5H_3, WS00923_E07) was negatively correlated with
myb myb_1 (WS00917_H19) that is loosely related to
TT2, a putative regulator of proanthocyanidin biosynthesis [62], and in our study a positional candidate for

both atk_2000 and sum_atk resistance traits (Additional

CYP750s suggest diverged, though unknown, functions
consistent with their position in different subclades

Phenylpropanoid Reductases

Phenylpropanoid reductases are a class of closely related
enzymes that include leucoanthocyanidin and isoflavone
reductases (LAR/IFR), pinoresinol and lariciresinol
reductasess (PLR), phenylcoumaran benzylic ether
reductase (PBR), and isoeugenol synthase (IES) that
have been shown to participate in the biosynthesis of a
plethora of constitutive and induced defense related
phenylpropanoids and phytoalexins, such as lignans and
isoflavans [63-67]. With the exception of the IFR family,
for which no white spruce homologues were identified,
at least two white spruce candidates were detected in
the other families (Figure 12A). A total of 12 white
spruce homologs cluster closely with the loblolly pine
PBR1 (Figure 12B) which reduces the benzylic ether
functionalities of both dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol and
dihydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol in the formation of 85’-linked lignans [66]. However, the phylogenetic distance of the white spruce candidates to the functionally
characterized angiosperm and gymnosperm phenylpropanoid reductases does not allow functional predictions
extending beyond similarity of the mechanism of the
catalyzed reaction.
Out of 21 array elements annotated as phenylpropanoid reductases 11 were present within the co-expression network ("PCBER”, Figure 4). Gene expression
variation of PicglPPR05 (represented by three array elements: WS00723_J06, WS0048_K01, WS00920_D17
(Figure 4 (9)): PCBER_6, PCBER_3, PCBER_16) was coexpressed with the secondary wall-associated AtMYB20
(myb_19; WS0071_H14), which was a candidate for the
ldr99 growth trait. PicglPPR21 is a positional candidate
for the sum_egg resistance trait; its transcript abundance
was lowest in the spruce mapping family with the most
vigorous growth and highest weevil attack rate (unpublished). In the network this PCBER gene (WS0086_D12;
PCBER_11) was connected to PicglDIR10 (WS0261_J16;
DIR_30), a member of the b/d-subfamily and the cluster
of peroxidases involving monolignol forming enzymes
(AtPER64, AtPER42, PicabPRX18, see above, and
PopalPRX WS0099_B17 (PRXR_51)), Figure 4 (8). Transcripts of PicglPPR13 (WS01011_J14) accumulated with
increasing growth rate, and PicglPPR13 (PCBER_19) was
negatively co-expressed with the resistance phenotype
candidate LAR WS00725_B17, DFR_3, Figure 4 (7). The
latter is correlated with another (remote) LAR representative WS00926_B24 (DFR_6) that was lowest expressed
in the spruce mapping family 26, the stress inducible
PicabPRX2 WS00928_G19 (PRXR_45), and the cluster
of dirigents involved in constitutive defenses, DIR_2,
DIR_32, DIR_31, DIR_18, DIR_20, Figure 4 (12), see
also below. The expression pattern for PicglPPR13 suggests that this PCBER could be involved either in susceptibility or tolerance to insect feeding. However, for

Page 15 of 26

other representatives (PicglPPR21) their co-expression
pattern suggests involvement in constitutive defenses.
Dirigent Proteins

A recent study on Sitka spruce dirigent-like proteins
(DIR) [29] reported 35 unique DIR or DIR-like genes.
For our survey, we were able to use expression data
from 23 elements annotated as unique DIRs and represented on the microarray covering distinct a-, b/d-, and
f-subfamilies (Additional File 1). The DIR f-subfamily is
spruce specific, while angiosperm members can be
found for both a- and b/d- subfamilies, [29] showed that
DIRs from different clades have distinct gene expression
patterns with a suggested role in induced defense to
weevil feeding for members of the a- subfamily. Representatives of b/d- and f-subfamilies are more likely
involved in primary processes or constitutive defense
(ibidem).
Within the network PicglDIR12 WS00815_A07 (b/dsubfamily, DIR_7) was co-expressed with a growth trait
associated transcription factor resembling secondary
wall-associated AtMYB20 (myb_19) and with a cluster
of six putative laccases, Figure 4 (9). A cluster of constitutive dirigents involving b/d-subfamily members (PicsiDIR17 WS01012_J06, PicsiDIR11 WS01012_K18,
PicsiDIR21 WS02610_M19, PicglDIR7 WS0262_G08
(Additional File 1)), and PicsiDIR26 WS0058_H22 from
f-subfamily were co-expressed with remote LAR
(DFR_3), one of the identified positional candidates for
weevil resistance, Figure 4 (12).
PgeDIR13 (WS00914_H24) was highly up-regulated in
bark tissue following weevil feeding and for PgeDIR2
(WS00911_I09), another a-subfamily member, the highest induction was registered, [29]. In the network, PgeDIR13 (DIR_11) was co-expressed with two other asubfamily members (PicsiDIR19 WS01011_J07, PicsiDIR16 WS01032_M02), DIR_17, DIR_25, Figure 4 (10),
and for PgeDIR2 gene expression was negatively regulated with the expression of the polyketide synthase
Picgl-PKS2, CHS_8, Figure 4 (11). Thus, our experiment
confirms previous observations that dirigent subfamilies
in constitutive defenses are differentially regulated than
dirigents in induced defenses. Similar to the cluster of
spruce/conifer-specific members from the OMT superfamily (OMTL), see above, dirigents from the same subfamily are also strongly co-expressed. This provides
evidence for the presence of a multitude of gene copies
with the same or highly similar protein functions that
act in related pathways.
Class III Peroxidases

Plant class III peroxidases represent a key multifunctional enzyme family that is involved in such diverse
processes as auxin catabolism, defenses, general stress

responses, and lignification [68]. Peroxidases were suggested to function in the radical reaction of monolignols
to the polymer lignin [69]. Misregulation of peroxidases
provided indications for altered lignin composition ([70],
review of xylem class III peroxidases in lignification:
[71] and [72]). Recently, two lignin-forming peroxidases
have been identified and characterized from Norway
spruce suspension culture showing substrate preference
for H- or G-lignin precursor molecules, respectively
[15]. To date, 17 peroxidase unigenes for conifer lignin
polymerization have been identified and their expression
abundance in different tissues and after biotic and abiotic challenges studied [73].
For eight genes (PicabPRX1, PicabPRX2, PicabPRX3,
PicabPRX4, PicabPRX6/PicabPRX7 cluster, PicabPRX16/
17, PicabPRX18, PicabPIPRX) the respective white
spruce orthologues were represented on the microarray
(Additional File 1, Additional File 13). While some peroxidases with proposed roles in lignin polymerization
are related to developmental lignification (PicabPRX1,
PicabPRX4, PicabPRX16/17 cluster, PicabPRX18, array
elements: see Additional File 1), others were stress inducible (PicabPRX2, PicabPRX3, PicabPIPRX, elements:
Additional File 1) and reflect the specific stress
responses of peroxidases ([73,15]). In addition, gene
expression of two other inducible peroxidases (PicsiPRX1 and PicsiPRX2, [59]) were surveyed (Additional
File 1). PicsiPRX1 (WS0012_J09, PRXR_4) was coexpressed with several other peroxidases, Figure 4 (6).
Constitutive expression levels of PicsiPRX2
(WS0074_A10) increased with higher inherent growth
rate of individuals (unpublished). PicsiPRX2 expression
(PRXR_26) was negatively correlated with expression of
stilbene synthase Picgl-PKS6 (CHS_11), a positional candidate for the egg_2001 resistance trait (Figure 4 (5)).
We suggest that PicsiPRX2 and Picgl-PKS6 are involved
in different defense strategies. The white spruce
PicabPRX2 orthologue WS00928_G19 is significantly
associated with the sum_egg resistance trait, and is also
co-expressed with the remote leucoanthocyanin reductase, one positional candidate for the “resistance phenotype” per se, (PRXR_45, DFR_3, Figure 4 (7), Additional
File 1).
The ability to bind lignin was demonstrated in vitro
for PicabPRX18 [73]. The white spruce orthologue of
PicabPRX18 is a positional candidate for Hgt1999
growth trait. PicabPRX16/17 is a positional candidate
for Hgt1997 trait. A co-expression cluster involving the
white spruce orthologue of PopalPRX WS0099_B17, a
putative spruce homologue of the secondary wall-associated transcription factor AtMYB83 WS0051_I02 and
S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (SAMS) WS0261_C18
were positional candidates for Hgt_1995 trait (PRXR_51,
myb_47, SAMS_6, Figure 4 (8)), Additional File 1. Also,

Page 17 of 26

the PicabPRX4 orthologue WS00912_J06 (PRXR_37)
was co-expressed with a cluster of peroxidases with
growth associations (Figure 4 (5), Additional File 1),
among them PicabPRX6/PicabPRX7 (WS00910_L21/
WS01025_F04: PRXR_36, PRXR_69). Interestingly, transcript abundance for all genes in this cluster decreased
with growth rate. This suggests that a number of peroxidases are important in reinforcement of anatomical
structures (via lignification, e.g.). Similarly, lignin biosynthetic genes are down-regulated in fast growing individuals [38].

Discussion
The stem-borer Pissodes strobi damages the host tree by
attacking the shoot apical leader of the previous year’s
growth. The feeding larvae typically consume phloem
tissue. In the spruce bark, the secondary phloem and
the cambium are very active chemical defense production zones that include secondary metabolites such as
the polyphenolics that are abundantly present in the
parenchyma. Pre-formed defenses are established coordinatedly during the development of secondary xylem
in the apical shoot [22].
We studied the complexity of phenylpropanoid-related
gene families and gene regulation of individual family
members. We found evidence for new pathways in conifer defenses that involve genes without counterparts in
modern plants that need to be further investigated.
Employing genetical genomics, we showed that this
approach is valuable for elucidating interactions between
genes that originate from complex families with multiple
related sequences. By including weevil resistance and
height growth traits in the quantitative analysis, we
identified eight genomic regions with extensive accumulation of phenotypic variation from multiple traits coinciding with hotspots of transcript abundance variation.
The identified master regulons ranked hierarchically
highest among all genotyped loci, since they are likely
responsible for massive gene expression variation in the
pathway and were linked to changes in the studied
phenotypes.
Phenylpropanoid and Related Gene Families in Spruce

Phenylpropanoids fulfill important functions as defense
compounds, e.g. simple hydroxycinnamic acids and
monolignols or the structurally complex flavonoids, isoflavonoids, and stilbenes. They have overlapping roles as
signaling molecules in plant development and plant
defense [74]. The conifer phenylpropanoid pathway is
characterized by a higher level of complexity compared
to angiosperms ([14] and this study) that might include
several not yet resolved alternative pathways. The
expansion of phenylpropanoid and related genes into
multi-gene families serves either the independent

Porth et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:608
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/608

regulation of the biosynthesis of different classes of
compounds or the gene dosage through massive accumulation of these compounds [74]. For example, we
identified several associations with weevil resistance
traits for individual members of the NADPH reductase
gene family with a range of product specificity of related
phenylpropanoid-derived plant defense compounds (Figure 12). We also identified associations for members
within two spruce- (or generally conifer-) specific
groups massively represented in the OMT superfamily
(Figure 10) and the phenylpropanoid P450s (clade of
CYP750, Additional File 8), respectively, both with
entirely unknown functions (Additional File 1).
Generally, plant specialized metabolism is characterized by gene duplication events and gene diversifications
leading to modified/optimized product specificity and
modified tissue specific expression [75]. However, it is
currently unclear whether adaptive or non-adaptive
forces are more important for the maintenance of gene
duplicates [34]. In brief, new pathways were established
among different plant species by independent recruitment and inactivation of biosynthetic enzymes through
downregulation or loss of certain genes of an ancestral
pathway [75]. Interestingly, it has been shown that
CCoAOMT-suppression in pine, unlike in angiosperms,
generates only moderate reduction in lignin due to compensatory reactions that lead to the incorporation of
unusual monolignols (catechyl units) [76]. In the Omethyltransferase family (CCoAOMT sequence similarity) we also found one gene with high similarity to functionally characterized catechol-OMT conserved across
species of the eukaryotic and prokaryotic kingdoms, but
was lacking in the angiosperms (Additional File 12).
In total, 44 positional candidate genes were directly
associated with resistance traits (Additional File 1). Positional candidate genes were prominently identified in
expanded gene families such as dirigents and peroxidases, for which some members are implicated in downstream reactions of lignan/lignin formation. Plant class
III peroxidases are a key multifunctional enzyme family
that is involved in diverse developmental and defense
processes ([68,71]). Evidence that certain peroxidases
may function in lignin polymerization came from gene
misexpression experiments that altered lignin composition [70]. In several gene families of the core lignin
pathway, members exist that can function in both
stress/elicitor response and developmental lignification
[77]. However, given the individual families sizes, phenylpropanoid reductase, CYP750, CHS/STS, and OMT
gene families showed the highest proportion of positional candidate genes for resistance. Spruce genes with
sequence similarities to COMT (caffeic acid O-methyltransferase) and F5H (ferulate-5-hydroxylase), two
enzymes involved in the syringyl (S-) lignin formation in

Page 18 of 26

angiosperms, were identified. Due to the lack of these
pathways in gymnosperms and to their low sequence
similarity, these sequences were annotated as OMTs
putatively involved in stilbenoid synthesis and P450s
putatively acting in flavonoid synthesis, respectively (see
above). It is likely that enzymatic reactions in monolignol/lignin biosynthesis are adopted from conserved
ancestral pathways that originally functioned in protection against microbial infection or UV radiation. Interestingly, those reactions emerged in different plant
lineages by convergent evolution [78].
Gene Expression Regulation of Gene Family Members in
the Phenylpropanoid Pathway

Microarray experiments that aim to elucidate gene
expression differences between treatment and control
groups usually involve reference or related designs in a
small sample set and cross-hybridizations between gene
spots with high nucleotide similarity complicate data
interpretation. However, the specific statistical procedure employed in genetical genomics that studies large
experimental populations of randomized genetic background reduces this effect. Positions of eQTLs locate
genomic regions that harbor regulatory elements that
control the expression of a single gene or a subset of
genes acting in the same pathway. In the case of cis-regulation, the genomic location of the eQTL coincides
with the physical location of the regulated gene, while
trans-acting eQTLs identify regulatory elements for the
gene elsewhere in the genome. Distribution of eQTLs
may spread evenly on the genome or appear in clusters
or in “hotspots” depending on the genetic architecture
of gene interactions. In this way, master regulons
involved in multiple traits (i.e., pleiotropic genes) can be
identified, and the amount of epistasis from interacting
loci can be uncovered [39]. We used this approach to
identify spruce genes that are potentially important for
constitutive defense mechanisms and to establish resistance against Pissodes strobi.
Apical leaders of 188 Picea glauca individuals were
studied for gene expression changes in phenylpropanoid
genes prioritized from our 21.8 k spruce EST chip (see
Material and Methods for details). Genomic regions
with clustered expression and phenotypic trait variation
might contain master regulons ([46,79]). Regions underlying trans-eQTL hotspots have pleiotropic genetic
background (Figure 5). Loci that accumulate pQTLs of
both growth and resistance traits may be involved in fitness trade-offs. We identified two such eQTL hotspots
on the spruce genome (LG 2 and LG 3). The thorough
functional analysis of such largely pleiotropic genes is
hampered because their knock-out mutants likely exhibit lethal or highly deleterious phenotypes [46]. However, recently, a locus was characterized which conveys

Porth et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:608
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/608

plant resistance to a wide spectrum of pathogens and
herbivores and at the same time reduces vegetative
growth [80]. The dirigents represent a candidate gene
family for which some members were associated with
both growth and resistance trait variation, e.g., expression variation for PicsiDIR17 (b/d-family) as well as PicsiDIR31 (f-family) mapped onto eQTL hotspots
associated with growth traits and resistance traits (Additional File 9).
Phylogeny and the analysis of the underlying gene
expression pattern identified functional divergence
among members of gene superfamilies. In several cases
gene expression of family members was co-regulated
with variation in weevil resistance. eQTLs that accumulated at resistance hotspots were generated from
diverged gene family members of CCoAOMT (PicglCCoAOMT1, PicglCCoAOMT2, PicglCCoAOMT3, see
also below), OMT (AEOMT and group C genes), PRXR
(PicabPIPRX, PicabPRX1, PicabPRX2, PicabPRX18, e.g.),
CYP450 (CYP75/F3’H, F3’5’H/F3H, CYP750), DIR (aand f-family, e.g.), the PCBER (LAR, PCBER), and 4CL
(acyl-CoA ligase, OPCL, 4CL) (Additional File 9). It has
recently been shown that tandem gene duplication and
subsequent gene retention is particularly common for
biotic stress genes [81]. This finding indicates that the
increased rate of gene duplication and diversification
offers the potential for adaptive evolution and divergence. Thus, the neo-and subfunctionalizations found in
the multi-gene families of the spruce phenylpropanoid
pathway are possibly highly important for beneficial
phenotypic innovations.
Linkage groups on our spruce QTL map were
assigned following [82] and the spruce-loblolly pine
comparative mapping project (C. Liewlaksaneeyanawin,
pers. comm; Additional File 2). Therefore, valuable
cross-species comparisons for QTL positions are available for Pinaceae, e.g., the two bona fide CCoAOMT
genes CCoAOMT-1 and CCoAOMT-2 mapped to the
spruce LG6 (Additional Files 2 and 9, Figure 5), in synteny with the recently published loblolly pine [83].
Not only did the two bona fide CCoAOMT genes harbor eQTL hotspots but also overlapped with QTL
regions for the traits atk_2000, egg_2000, and sum_egg
(Figure 5). This suggests a close association of monolignol formation with defense against the stem borer Pissodes strobi. It is known that cell wall-integral lignin
provides a physical barrier for invading pests. Specifically, the lignified parenchyma cells are the important
pre-formed anatomical structures that are involved in
such constitutive defenses [21]. In addition, localized de
novo synthesis of lignin with structural similarity to
early developmental lignins occurs in response to stress
and is associated with wound healing ([84,85,6,86]). At
the two CCoAOMT loci, eQTLs were mostly generated

Page 19 of 26

from genes of the shikimate pathway, monolignol biosynthesis and downstream condensation reactions, lignan formation, flavonoid biosynthesis, and
multifunctional OMT activity. The genomic region harboring the cluster of CCoAOMT genes flags its general
importance. We found in our large-scale transcriptomics
study that 36% and 53% of the mapped trans-eQTLs
generated from 1307 and 992 genes, respectively, were
commonly shared between both CCoAOMT loci. Certain gene ontology categories were overrepresented and
commonly shared between the two eQTL cluster (secondary metabolic process, response to biotic stimulus, e.
g.). This suggests interactions between both CCoAOMT
loci and other genes that extend beyond the phenylpropanoid metabolism. Further investigations will substantiate this in detail.
In contrast to CCoAOMT-1 and CCoAOMT-2, association with extensive phenotypic variation is currently
unknown for CCoAOMT-3. Yet, the three CCoAOMT
genes represent our most comprehensive example of differential gene regulation for duplicated genes (the phylogeny of the family is given in Figure 8). No trans-eQTL
from CCoAOMT-1 mapped onto CCoAOMT-2 and
vice versa; however, the third CCoAOMT gene exhibited
trans-eQTLs at both loci, suggesting a lower regulatory
hierarchy for CCoAOMT-3 among all three genes (Figure 8). CCoAOMT-1 expression variation also mapped
onto the growth trait associated eQTL hotspot on
LG13, and, generally, the transcript abundance of
CCoAOMT-1 was increased with higher inherent
growth rate in the experimental population (not shown).
CCoAOMT-3 is a positional candidate for hgt1999 trait.
At locus CCoAOMT-2 eQTLs from ERFs linked to
defensive gene expression (ERFs from group IX [87],
specifically, transcription repressors (ERF3, ERF4, ERF7
[88])) accumulated (unpublished results). Consequently,
CCoAOMT-2 could indeed function in constitutive
resistance. The identified regulators (ERFs) were shown
to affect important constitutively expressed defense
genes such as basic chitinase and glycosyl hydrolase
family 17 protein (beta-1,3-glucanase, [88]). The three
monolignol biosynthesis genes were likely retained
throughout evolution because of their individual importance and their temporally and spatially dependent
recruitment for lignin formation: lignin that is constitutively expressed and related to primary processes, lignin
that is wound inducible and participates in active
defense, or lignin that is deposited for wound healing.

Conclusions
This study describes the genetics of pest resistance and
utilizes genetical genomics to elucidate the genetic basis
and evolution of phenolics based insect resistance in a
commercially valuable conifer tree species. The results

Porth et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:608
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/608

add to recent QTL studies that have dissected mechanisms underlying the genetic control of wood traits and
volume growth in eucalyptus but were completely lacking testing of biotic stress resistance, and in particular,
for conifers [89]. We utilized eQTL mapping to conduct
a pre-selection of the candidate genes by testing for correlations with resistance traits. The findings can facilitate research efforts on targeted gene association studies
specific to nonstructured conifer populations aimed at
resolving the genetic basis of host resistance to
herbivory.
Our work also provides a substantial account and perspective of the functional characterization of several
unresolved alternative pathways in plant defenses. The
subfunctionalization of individual gene family members
of the phenylpropanoid pathway was evident at the phylogenetic and at the gene expression level. Using genetical genomics, we confirmed that some candidate genes in
this pathway were indeed genetically associated with
QTLs for white pine weevil resistance. Weevil resistance
was also associated with trans-regulatory hotspots. At
such genomic regions, eQTLs were generated by several
subfamilies from multimember families like 4CL,
CCoAOMT, OMT, CYP450, PPR, DIR, and PRXR. Tandem gene duplication and subsequent gene retention is
common for biotic stress genes [81]. Phenylpropanoid
metabolism has been identified as a source of tandemly
repeated orthologous groups [81]. Based on their tight
genetic linkage [83], bona fide CCoAOMT genes in conifers might be tandemly repeated in the genome. In this
study we found that all three genes present in the spruce
genome are functionally diverged. Thus, in multi-gene
families of the phenylpropanoid/lignin pathway individual members can be recruited for plant development
and pest resistance, respectively. Neo- and subfunctionalizations in such gene families can be important
resources for genetic variation in the perennial. Recently,
it was shown that members of the small PAL gene family
in the herbaceous annual Arabidopsis can have both distinct and overlapping functions in processes related to
growth, development, and responses to environmental
stresses [90]. Our results add to the existing literature on
the role of the phenylpropanoid pathway in the evolution
of conifer defense mechanism against insect pests. Our
findings highlight that specific genes within the phenylpropanoid pathway can be duplicated and diversified in
long-lived conifers in a process that is fundamentally different from shorter lived angiosperm species.

Methods
Picea Glauca (Moench) Voss × Picea Engelmanii Parry ex
Engelm. Pedigree

An outline of the experimental setup is given in Figure
2. Experimental spruce populations were chosen from a

Page 20 of 26

controlled-cross progeny trial established in 1995 at
Kalamalka Research Station in Vernon, BC, Canada [43].
The respective males and females originated from individuals previously ranked for weevil-resistance in openpollinated progeny tests [91]. Out of twenty crosses i.e.,
resistant-female-by-susceptible-male crosses, four
crosses with markedly intermediate weevil resistance
[43] and forming a partial diallel were studied in depth
(cross 26 from ♀PG87*♂PG165, cross 27 from
♀PG87*♂PG117, cross 29 from ♀PG21*♂PG165 and
cross 32 from ♀PG21*♂PG117, respectively and Figure
2), see also below.
In-silico SNPs were identified from the Treenomix
EST database (K. Ritland pers. comm.). From these
SNPs, a mapping population of 417 individuals involving
a factorial cross design of 3 × 2 crosses was screened
using a 384-plex GoldenGate Genotyping BeadArray
Illumina platform ([92], Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA,
USA) at the CMMT Genotyping and Gene Expression
Core Facility, Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics, Vancouver, BC. Total genomic DNA had been
isolated from flushing bud/needle tissue of those individuals according to the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method established by [93]. Genotypes
were scored using the BeadStudio software.
Of all putative SNP loci in the genotyping assay, 73.476.0% high quality SNPs were considered in the analysis;
Individuals in the crosses that could not be confirmed as
full-sibs were removed from subsequent phenotyping
(cross 26: 7%, cross 27: 10%, cross 29: 4%, cross 32: 1%
of the trees alive in 2006). Using a joint likelihood
method [94] we determined recombination rates
between each pair of loci, and relative genetic distances
(centiMorgans) using JoinMap 3.0 software [95] (original
genotype data are provided in the Additional File 3). We
followed the approach by [96] for grouping markers and
marker ordering. We included two additional crosses (C.
Liewlaksaneeyanawin, pers. comm.,) in the analysis to
maximize the number of mapped loci. The established
framework genetic map is based on 252 SNPs and is
presented in Additional File 2.
Tree Height, Weevil Attack, and Oviposition Data

Measures were taken for the initial tree height in 1995
(year one), and heights in years three and five as well as
leader length in year five preceding the artificial augmentation of the local weevil population in October of
the same year (hgt1995, hgt1997, hgt1999, and ldr1999,
respectively). Attack rates in 2000 and 2001 (atk2000,
atk2001) were classified as successful ‘top kills’, ‘failure’
to kill the leader and ‘no attack’ [43], in addition, for the
same years, egg counts along the leaders (egg2000,
egg2001) were summarized into five discrete classes
(successful egg laying was recognized as feeding

Alfaro, pers. Communication. For details see Additional
File 4. In addition, the sum of weevil attacks and the
sum of oviposition for 2000 and 2001 were used as traits
(sum_atk, and sum_egg).
Tissue Collection, RNA Preparation, and Microarray

Tree material within a replicate block was sampled in a
randomized fashion among the plots (i.e., crosses, Figure
2). Terminal leaders from trees in a block were collected
in the mornings of May 16, 17, and 18, 2006, respectively. At the location bark/phloem tissue was immediately harvested from cut leaders as described previously
([97,59]), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at
-80°C until processed. Total RNA from unattacked individuals was isolated following the protocol of [98] and
quantified using NanoDrop ® ND-1000 Spectrophotometer; RNA integrity was evaluated using the Agilent
2100 Bioanalyzer. The 21,840 spruce ESTs on the array
involved elements from 12 different cDNA libraries,
built from different tissues (bark, phloem, xylem), which
were under different developmental stages, as well as
wound/methyljasmonate treated (ca. 6,500 elements)
and untreated (ca. 15,400). Complete details of cDNA
microarray fabrication and quality control are described
elsewhere (S. Ralph and co-workers, Gene Expression
Omnibus database GEO: GPL5423 and http://www.treenomix.ca/).
Microarray Experimental Design, Gene Expression
Profiling, and Pre-processing of Expression Data

After we tested six genotyped crosses using the previously collected phenotypic data (see above), we determined that genotype differences between most and least
resistant progeny were highest in crosses 26, 27, 29, and
32. A distant pair design for microarray analysis that
maximized direct comparisons between different alleles
at each locus was originally introduced by [41] and was
modified here for outbred individuals. We estimated the
genetic distance for possible probe-pairs genome-wide
by using all segregating SNP loci (122 on average). Such
a procedure maximized the number of distant pairs in a
given cross. A 25% improvement over random pairing
was achieved. We also balanced the two dyes across the
three replicate blocks (i.e., sampling on three different
days), the different batches of microarray fabrication,
and different experimenters (see below). Our design
resulted in 94 hybridizations profiling 48 individuals in
cross 26, 36 in cross 27, and 50 in cross 29, as well as
54 individuals in cross 32 (Additional File 5).
Hybridizations were performed using the Genisphere
Array350 kit (Genisphere, Hatfield, USA) following
manufacturer’s instructions. Forty micrograms total
RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II

Page 21 of 26

reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo d(T18) primers with a 5’ unique sequence overhang specific to
either the Cy3 or Cy5 labeling reactions. The RNA
strand of the resulting cDNA:RNA hybrid was hydrolyzed in 0.075 M NaOH/0.0075 M EDTA at 65°C for 15
min followed by neutralization in 0.175 M Tris-HCl (pH
8.0).
Following pooling of the appropriate Cy3 and Cy5
cDNAs, samples were precipitated with linear acrylamide and resuspended in 17.7 μL nuclease-free water. A
27.3 μL hybridization mixture containing 22.5 μL 2 ×
SDS buffer, 4 μL LNA d(T) blocker, 2 μg sheared salmon testes DNA (Invitrogen) and 0.3 μL of Cy5-labeled
GFP cDNA (Cy5-dUTP and Ready-To-Go labeling
beads, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the
cDNA probe. Immediately prior to use, arrays were prewashed 2× in 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 5 min
each, followed by two washes in MilliQ-H2O for 2 min
each, 3 min at 95°C in MilliQ-H2O, and dried by centrifugation (3 min at 2000 rpm in an IEC Centra CL2 centrifuge with rotor IEC 2367-00 in 50 mL conical tube).
The cDNA probe was heat denatured at 80°C for 10
min, then maintained at 65°C prior to adding to a
microarray slide heated to 55°C, covered with a 22 × 60
× 1.5 mm glass coverslip (Fisher Scientific), and incubated for 16 h at 60°C. Arrays were washed in 2× SSC,
0.2% SDS at room temperature for 5 min to remove the
coverslip, followed by 15 min at 65°C in the same solution, then three washes of 5 min in 2× SSC at room
temperature, and three washes of 5 min in 0.2× SSC at
room temperature, and dried by centrifugation. The Cy3
and Cy5 3DNA capture reagent (Genisphere) were then
hybridized to the bound cDNA on the microarray in a
45 μL volume consisting of 22.5 μL 2× SDS buffer, 17.5
μL nuclease-free water, 2.5 μL Cy3 capture reagent, and
2.5 μL Cy5 capture reagent. The 3DNA capture reagent
is bound to its complementary cDNA capture sequence
on the Cy3 or Cy5 oligo d(T) primers. The second
hybridization was performed for 3 h at 60°C and was
then washed and dried as before.
Fluorescent images of hybridized arrays were acquired
by using ScanArray Express (PerkinElmer, Foster City,
USA). The Cy3 and Cy5 cyanine fluors were excited at
543 nm and 633 nm, respectively. All scans were performed at the same laser power (90%), but with the
photomultiplier tube settings for the two channels
adjusted such that the ratio of the mean signal intensities was ~1, and the percentage of saturated array elements was < 0.5% but > 0%, while minimizing
background fluorescence. Fluorescent intensity data
were extracted by using the ImaGene 6.0 software (Biodiscovery, El Segundo, USA). Signal intensity measurements were deposited in GEO under the accession
number GSE22116.

After quantification of the signal intensities in each
array were completed, the local background was subtracted for each subgrid. Data were normalized to compensate for non-linearity of intensity distributions using
the variance stabilizing normalization method [99].
Finally, all 94 slides underwent simultaneous normalization to achieve a similar and array-independent overall
expression level and variance for every channel. The linear model
hi = μ + dye + block + batch + person + εi ,

(1)

with μ as the overall mean, was then fit to the normalized intensities of each gene i (hi ) in the Cy3 and Cy5
channels to account for technical effects within the experiment (gene-specific ‘dye’ effect, replicate ‘block’, microarray fabrication ‘batch’, experimenter ‘person’ are all fixed
effects). The residuals were used in the subsequent eQTL
analysis. The above statistics were carried out using the R
statistical package http://www.r-project.org.
QTL Analysis

QTLs were mapped in the diallel progeny by employing
a likelihood function to assess the phenotype effect
(gene expression, other traits) conditional on genotypic
variation. We used R http://www.r-project.org to display
QTL density maps. A QTL was significant at LOD≥3.84
(defined as the log likelihood ratio for the statistical support of the presence of a QTL within a 10 cM marker
interval) and had to be detected for at least one parent
in the diallel, however we did not show whether that
specific QTL was also detected in any other parent (Figure 5). A goodness-of-fit test assuming a uniform distribution was performed to test whether the observed
frequencies of eQTLs along the linkage map differed
significantly from the expected value. Following the
rejection of the null hypothesis (c2 = 3,551, df = 251, pvalue < 2.2e-16), we declared “eQTL hotspots” if the
number of eQTLs at a given locus was equal or above
the maximum value (i.e., 38) for assessed eQTL clusters
from a randomly generated data set using 4,221 eQTLs,
252 markers, and running 1,000 replicates. Positional
candidate genes were identified by collocation of at least
40% of their eQTLs with phenotypic trait QTLs based
on the criteria for identifying significant QTLs (see
above) and running 10,000 randomizations (p ≤ 0.05).
Co-Expression Network Analysis

We used the software package GeneNet 1.2.3 http://
strimmerlab.org/software/genenet/ to assess gene-gene
interactions. First, the ‘family’ effect was removed from
the data using the ANOVA model
hi = μ + dye + block + family + batch + person + εi . (2)

The residuals were retained and utilized in the analysis. Gene co-expression based on partial correlations
was assessed using a graphical Gaussian model (GGM)
and a shrinkage method implemented in the GeneNet
software package [100]. Here, neighbors have direct
dependencies, since indirect gene connections are
removed by this method. As a significance cut-off we
used the 80% probability for presence of gene-pair interconnection. For visual representation of the network we
used Pajek 1.24 software [101].
Phylogenetic Analyses

Contigs for candidate genes (Figure 1) from white spruce
(Picea glauca) were created in silico from EST sequences
retrieved through reciprocal BLAST searches as described
in [25-29]. An arbitrary cut-off of sequence identity
exceeding 99% was used to identify possible allelic variation. Phylogenetic analyses on aligned amino acid
sequences (dialign2; http://bioweb2.pasteur.fr/; manually
curated; Bioedit v7.0.9 http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/
bioedit.html) were tested for consistency and the reconstructed maximum likelihood tree was bootstrapped
[PhyML; http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/binaries.
php; four rate substitution categories, g shape parameter
optimized, JTT (Jones-Taylor-Thornton) substitution
model, BioNJ starting tree and 100 bootstrap repetitions
[102]] and displayed as phylogram using treeview32 1.6.6
(http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html
[103]). Tree topologies were supported using the independent maximum likelihood algorithm TREE-PUZZLE 5.2
(http://www.tree-puzzle.de[104]). Array elements were
mapped onto the phylogenetic trees by homology. Information about sequences from Arabidopsis and functionally characterized orthologues that were retrieved from
public databases is given in Additional File 14. In decreasing order of priority, we used: (i) model plants with
sequenced genomes (Arabidopsis, poplar and rice), (ii)
functionally characterized members from non-model
plants (gymnosperms, finally illustrative members from
other angiosperms). Fully sequenced genomes allow assessing possible species- or lineage-specific expansions which
are indicative of the mode of evolution (for example in the
rice and spruce COMT superfamily). Functionally characterized individual members demonstrate diversification
(neofunctionalization) in subfamilies.
