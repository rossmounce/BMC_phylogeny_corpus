Abstract
Background: Pleistocene events have shaped the phylogeography of many taxa worldwide. Their genetic signatures
in tropical species have been much less explored than in those living in temperate regions. We analysed the genetic
structure of a Malagasy primate species, a mouse lemur with a wide distribution (M. murinus), in order to investigate
such phylogeographic processes on a large tropical island. We also evaluated the effects of anthropogenic pressures
(fragmentation/deforestation) and natural features (geographic distance, rivers) on genetic structure in order to
complement our understanding of past and present processes of genetic differentiation.
Results: The analysis of the mitochondrial D-loop sequences of 195 samples from 15 study sites (10 from a continuous
forest and five from isolated forest fragments) from two adjacent Inter-River-Systems (IRSs) revealed that forest
fragmentation and the river restrict gene flow, thereby leading to an increased genetic differentiation between
populations beyond the effect of isolation-by-distance. Demographic simulations detected signals of two successive
spatial expansions that could be preliminarily dated to the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. The haplotype network
revealed geographic structure and showed deep molecular divergences within and between the IRSs that would be
congruent with a two-step colonization scenario.
Conclusions: This study supports the hypothesis of a relatively recent spatial expansion of the grey mouse lemur in
northwestern Madagascar, which may also explain why this taxon, in contrast to its congeners, has not yet undergone
allopatric speciation in the studied area and possibly across its presently wide range.
Background
Pleistocene events have shaped the phylogeography of
many taxa worldwide [1]. Particular emphasis has been
put on these dynamics in temperate regions [2]. Tropical
biomes have also been shown to have undergone complex
ecological dynamics following worldwide Pleistocene climate changes [3], but their genetic signatures in presentday natural populations are much less explored. The
genetic structure of natural populations is not only
shaped by these ancient processes but also by ongoing
natural (e.g. migration, genetic drift) and more recent
anthropogenic factors [4].
One model region for the study of the combined effects
of ancient and recent factors is Madagascar. This island
has been isolated from all other landmasses during the
last 80 million years (My) and different vertebrate groups

have undergone complex phylogeographic histories [5].
Moreover, Madagascar has been strongly affected by
anthropogenic disturbances during the last 2000 years
following the arrival of humans on the island [6,7].
Approximately 90% of the original vegetation is believed
to have already disappeared ([8], but see [9] for less
extreme estimates) and most forests are now heavily fragmented [10,11]. This poses a particular threat to forestdependent species, since barriers such as novel savannahs
can significantly modify their genetic structure [12]. Such
barriers can notably reduce gene flow between populations which can lead to a loss of alleles, an increase in
homozygosity and inbreeding through isolation [13].
Lemurs are an endemic mammal group on Madagascar.
Within lemurs, mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.) form an
exceptionally diverse genus. The number of described
Microcebus species has increased from four to 18 in
recent years (overview in [14,15]) due to largely increased
sampling efforts and to the application of phylogenetic
analyses of DNA sequences. Mouse lemurs are small,

nocturnal, solitary foragers that inhabit a large variety of
forest habitats with no more than two species co-occurring in a given area (see [16] for a review).
The high species diversity of lemurs in general and of
mouse lemurs in particular has been explained as a joint
effect of topographic barriers (large rivers, mountains)
and/or Pleistocene climatic and vegetation changes [1719]. Recent studies indicate that most large rivers act as
genetic barriers for mouse lemurs [19,20] and it has been
suggested that a long-term separation between adjacent
Inter-River-Systems (IRSs) promoted speciation in this
clade [19]. This process may explain the very limited distributions of many species.
In contrast to most other lemur species, the grey mouse
lemur (M. murinus) has a wide distribution as it inhabits
the dry deciduous forests from southern to northwestern
Madagascar [14]. The apparent lack of speciation events
within this taxon could be the result of a lower speciation
rate, a higher migratory potential, or a relatively recent
expansion of this species into the western IRSs of Madagascar. The latter hypothesis is supported by three lines
of evidence and shall be further investigated in this study:
i) In a recent study Kappeler et al. [21] estimated the age
of the M. murinus clade to about 1.4 My, which sets an
upper Pleistocene limit for its expansion; ii) M. murinus
possesses an ecological preference for dry habitats [22]
which are typical for southern Madagascar; iii) M. murinus is the closest relative of M. griseorufus from southern
Madagascar [19,23] which suggests that this expansion
may have originated in southern Madagascar. This geographic setting would indeed suggest a late Pleistocene or
even postglacial colonization of western to northwestern
Madagascar by the grey mouse lemur.
Grey mouse lemurs occur in partial sympatry with the
golden-brown mouse lemur (M. ravelobensis) and with
the Bongolava mouse lemur (M. bongolavensis) in two
adjacent IRSs at their northern distribution limit ([19],
Figure 1). The effect of natural and anthropogenic factors
on population structure and genetic diversity of M. ravelobensis and M. bongolavensis has been studied in some
detail using mtDNA [24] and microsatellites [12,25].
These studies revealed a negative influence of forest fragmentation on genetic diversity [24] and showed an effect
of isolation-by-distance for M. ravelobensis [12,25].
Moreover, large rivers and savannahs were shown to
reduce or even prevent gene-flow between populations
and have generated genetic structure [24,25].
This study aims to assess the effects of phylogeographic
processes, anthropogenic pressures (fragmentation/
deforestation), and natural features (geographic distance,
rivers) on the genetic structure of the grey mouse lemur
at its northern distribution edge. Populations in this area
are predicted to show signs of a Pleistocene spatial expansion from the likely southern origin towards the north-

western IRSs. Spatial simulations were used to identify
the expansion model which fitted best to the patterns of
molecular diversity observed in extant M. murinus populations. The results are compared to previously published
data on M. ravelobensis, which may have arrived before.
By means of spatial simulations, we could detect signals
of two successive spatial expansions of M. murinus in
northwestern Madagascar which could be preliminarily
dated to the late Pleistocene and the early Holocene.

Results
Genetic diversity

A total of 367 monomorphic (81.9%) and 81 polymorphic
positions (18.1%) were identified in the D-loop sequences
(455 bp) of the 195 individuals. A total of 47 different
haplotypes were found which differed in 1-37 positions in
pairwise comparisons.
The genetic diversity of sites varied in the ANP, as well
as among the isolated forest fragments (Table 1). Three
sites exhibited no genetic variation. These were two sites
with small sample sizes in the ANP (Ambodimanga,
Komandria) and one forest fragment with a large sample
size (Maroakata, in IRS2). However, we found no overall
significant influence of sample size on the number of
haplotypes or on haplotype diversity (no. of haplotypes:
R2 = 0.104, F(1,13) = 1.507, n.s.; haplotype diversity: R2 =
0.002, F(1,13) = 0.028, n.s.).
In general, the ANP samples showed the highest
genetic diversity, in particular sites with larger sample
sizes (n > 5). The four samples with most haplotypes (n =
7) were located within the ANP. The three ANP samples
with only one or two haplotypes were also the smallest
samples with three or five individuals, respectively.
Among the isolated fragments, Tanambao possessed the
highest number of haplotypes (n = 6), while the other
sites were less diverse. When comparing haplotype diversity, allelic richness or nucleotide diversity statistically
between the sites in the ANP and the isolated forest fragments, however, no significant difference could be
revealed (Mann-Whitney-U: Hd: U = 19, n1 = 10, n2 = 5,
n.s.; AR(r): U = 14.5, n1 = 8, n2 = 5, n.s.; Nd: U = 17; n1 = 10,
n2 = 5, n.s.). This lack of statistical evidence could be due
to a lack of power given the small overall number of study
sites and some variability among fragments and among
ANP sites.
Demographic history

Table 1 shows the results of Tajima's D and Fu's Fs tests.
Six out of 12 values of Tajima's D were negative, two of
them significantly (Beronono, Mangatelo), while none of
the populations showed significantly positive D values.
Similarly, no Fu's Fs values were significant (Table 1). No
tests were carried out for Ambodimanga, Komandria and
Maroakata due to their lack of polymorphism.

sites within the park, is indicated in the upper left corner.

The mismatch distributions were not significantly different from those expected under one spatial expansion
(Model 1) for any of the samples (Table 2). The visual
inspection of the distributions, however, revealed three
distinct peaks, despite the relative raggedness of the mismatches for single samples (Figure 2). The presence of
three modes was particularly clear when all samples of
IRS1 were grouped together to increase sample size (IRS1
total, Figure 3a). The first mode was located at zero pairwise differences and was visible in all samples and in the
expected distribution generated by the simulation of one
spatial expansion (Figure 3a and Figure 2). The second
mode ranged from 5 to 15 pairwise differences and the
third from 23 to 33 pairwise differences. Only two of the

three modes observed in the data were produced in simulations of one spatial expansion (Model 1), either the first
and the second or the first and the third (open circles in
Figure 3a, Figure 2). This pattern indicates that a more
complex model is necessary to better fit the data, suggesting that two spatial expansions separated by a period of
demographic contraction may be more accurate (Model
2). As no specific statistical test is available to determine
if a mismatch distribution fits the Model 2, we tested this
hypothesis using simulations.
As shown in Figure 3b, the two simulated successive
expansions did indeed produce three modes which can be
explained by three main phases of coalescence. Going
backward in time these phases can be described using the

terminology that Wakeley [26,27] used to describe the
coalescent in structured models: They are called the
"scattering" and the "collecting" phases (S and C). S is
characterized by a series of recent coalescent events
which correspond to individuals in the sample that are
related (i.e., they have recent ancestors, and so do their
alleles). The two older phases (C1 and C2) correspond to
the "collecting phases" which occur at the level of the
metapopulation, and in our case during the spatial contraction (going backward in time). They correspond to
the alleles whose common ancestor can be traced to the
time of the range expansion (going forward in time). In a

widely distributed but randomly mating population,
coalescent events are rare and randomly distributed in
time (according to the coalescent theory), but during a
range expansion from one region, many coalescent events
occur around the time of the expansion because individuals are restricted to a smaller geographic area. In the simulated Model 2, the three main periods of coalescence
translate into three modes in the mismatch distribution.
In the gene genealogy (Figure 3b), we thus see that if one
population expands during two separate periods, we can
expect to observe two collecting phases, which will generate mismatch distributions similar to those observed in

the dataset (Figure 3a). Note that when looking at single
simulations instead of the average distribution, the three
modes are not always clearly visible together (Figure 4).
This result fits well with our observed mismatch distributions for single samples (Figure 2).
Genetic differentiation between populations

Pairwise ΦST values ranged widely from 0 to 1, but most
values (83 out of 91) were above 0.2 and only seven were
not significant (Additional file 1: Table S1). Therefore, the
sites can be generally regarded as genetically differentiated from each other. Genetic (ΦST values) and geographic distances (km) were significantly and positively
correlated in the IRS1 (Mantel test, rp = 0.487, n = 13, p <
0.001) suggesting the existence of isolation-by-distance
within IRS1.
Influence of the Mahajamba River

The importance of the Mahajamba River as a barrier to
gene flow between IRS1 and IRS2 was tested with an
AMOVA and with permutation tests. All variance components and fixation indices were large and significantly
different from zero. The highest proportion of the molecular variance (41.2%) was explained by the variations
between sites within each IRS while 32.8% is explained by

the river (the remaining 26.0% of the molecular variance
is explained by the variation within sites). These values
should be interpreted with care, however, since we only
had two samples in IRS2 which are almost fixed for very
different haplotypes. The permutation tests showed that
average ΦST values across the Mahajamba river were significantly higher than those between samples from the
same side of the river (averages: 0.87 vs. 0.55, p < 0.001),
but we note that some pairwise ΦST values between populations from the same side of the river were also very
high (seven out of 34 were greater than 0.87, the across
river average).
Influence of forest fragmentation

Pairwise ΦST values were significantly higher between
populations separated by a savannah (n = 21) than
between populations separated by a "continuous" forest
habitat (i.e., within the ANP, n = 45; means: 0.66 vs. 0.47,
p < 0.01, Figure 5). This was confirmed by the analysis of
the residuals, which were significantly higher for samples
separated by savannah stretches. This suggests that populations separated by savannah stretches are more prone to
drift than those within the ANP, probably due to the more
limited size of the fragments they live in.

Genetic structure by haplotype network

Thirteen of 47 haplotypes (27.7%) were shared among
several sites (Figure 6). These sites were all located within
the ANP with the exception of the Ste Marie fragment
which shared all its haplotypes with different ANP populations. Ste Marie, however, is located only 3 km from the
ANP. Within the ANP, haplotype sharing mostly occurred
between neighbouring sites. The remaining four forest
fragments had only private haplotypes.
The network analysis revealed three distinct sets of
haplotypes which were separated by more than 23 mutation steps from each other (Figure 6). The first set was
within IRS1. It contained 43 different haplotypes which
showed 1-37 pairwise differences, and could be grouped
into four clusters separated by more than 10 mutational
steps. Even though the most divergent haplotypes are
very different, there are many intermediate haplotypes.
The other haplotypes were located within the IRS2 and
were separated by at least 30 mutation steps from each
other and by 24-26 mutations from the closest IRS1 haplotype. One haplotype was limited to Maroakata and the
other three to Tsinjomitondraka. In contrast, the spatial
structure was not as obvious within the IRS1, as haplotypes observed within one site were not always more similar to each other than to haplotypes from other sites.
However, a spatial structure was revealed after mapping
the representation of the four clusters in IRS1 (Figure 7).
The sites in the ANP could be partitioned into a homoge-

nous western and eastern division, respectively, and a
zone of heterogeneous composition in the centre. The
four westernmost sites in the ANP (Komandria, Bealana,
JBA, Ambodimanga) mainly contained haplotypes of
cluster 2, whereas the four eastern sites in the ANP (Beronono, Bevazaha, Ankoririka, Andoharano) and the fragment Mangatelo mainly contained haplotypes of cluster
1. Haplotypes of cluster 3 were only found in three heterogeneous central park populations (Ambanjakely,
Andoharano, Andofombobe) and the two fragments Ste
Marie and Tanambao. Finally, cluster 4 which consists of
one haplotype, was only present in the northernmost
fragment Tanambao.

Discussion
This study provides evidence for two successive spatial
expansions of M. murinus in northwestern Madagascar
(see below) but could also demonstrate some effects of
forest fragmentation, geographic distance and the large
river Mahajamba on the genetic structure of this widely
distributed mouse lemur species. These anthropogenic
and environmental effects shall be discussed first, before
we move to the phylogeographic processes.
Effects of forest fragmentation and environmental features
on genetic diversity and genetic structure

Our results suggest that forest fragmentation significantly
increased genetic drift in the isolated fragments. However, even though the genetic diversity of samples from
the ANP was generally high, the difference with isolated
fragments was not significant. This suggests that a larger
dataset (both in terms of number of study sites and
within-site sample sizes) would be required to draw
stronger conclusions about the effect of forest fragmentation on the diversity of M. murinus. When compared to
the sympatric M. ravelobensis, the number of haplotypes
and the haplotype diversity per site were not significantly
different (HANP: 3-8, HIFF: 1-8, HdANP: 0.542-0.880, HdIFF:
0-0.656, [28], four comparisons with MWU-test: n.s.).
Therefore, the effect of fragmentation on genetic diversity can be assumed to be similar in both species.
Besides affecting the genetic diversity within populations, fragmentation also increased the genetic differentiation between them beyond the effects of isolation-bydistance which was also detected. The average ΦST values
between sites isolated by savannah were significantly
higher than those between sites from the ANP (i.e. continuous forest) despite comparable geographic distances.
Furthermore, haplotype sharing was typically not
observed between isolated fragments but only between
sites in the ANP. The only exception was Ste Marie that
shared its four haplotypes with different Park populations. It must be emphasized, though, that Ste Marie is
separated from the ANP only by a 3 km stretch of savan-

The haplotypes with the highest outgroup probability are displayed as a square, the other haplotypes are displayed as ovals [54]. Each node represents
a mutation step between haplotypes. The numbers of mutation steps between the networks of the IRS2 and the network of the IRS1 are provided
(see arrows). The haplotypes of IRS1 belong to four different clusters, separated by at least ten mutation steps.

nah. Surprisingly, a previous study on M. ravelobensis in
Ste Marie did not find haplotype sharing with ANP populations [24]. These differences in their genetic diversity
may be the result of divergent colonization histories or of
different migration abilities during the fragmentation
process.
Our study provides evidence for a significant influence
of the Mahajamba River on genetic differentiation but not
as high as in their reddish sister species. Guschanski et al.
[24] found that 82.7% of the molecular variance in the
reddish mouse lemurs of northwestern Madagascar was
explained by the Sofia and Mahajamba Rivers, while we
found that the Mahajamba River explained only 32% of
the molecular variation in M murinus. Note that at that
time M. ravelobensis and M. bongolavensis specimen
were still believed to form two clades within the same
species. D-loop haplotypes from the western or eastern
side of the river Mahajamba differed in more than 59 base
pairs [24], compared to the minimum of 24 bp differences
found in this study for M. murinus. A later study showed
that the two reddish clades had already diverged into two
separate species and that the river had probably promoted this speciation event [19]. This comparative evidence suggests that either the common ancestors of the
reddish mouse lemur species colonized the IRS1 and

IRS2 earlier than M. murinus or that M. murinus possesses larger migratory abilities that sustain gene flow
between the IRSs (around the headwaters of the large rivers), counteracting genetic drift on both sides of the river.
The latter explanation seems to be less likely, since the
haplotypes of either side of the river have diverged completely, indicating that the river effectively prevents gene
flow between the IRSs. A later arrival of M. murinus in
the northwest compared to the ancestors of M. ravelobensis and M. bongolavensis would also explain why
the grey mouse lemur clade did not yet undergo speciation in these two IRSs. Ultimately, this barrier function of
the river may be sufficient so that populations in the two
IRSs may eventually diverge into distinct species.
Taken together, the AMOVA and the network analyses
suggest that the genetic differentiation in M. murinus
within IRS1 and IRS2 reached levels comparable to the
ones existing between the IRSs. This may indicate that
the genetic lineages within the IRSs have diverged very
early during the colonization process or that they result
from several colonization events. These hypotheses are
discussed in the next section.
Signatures of a recent colonization history

Assuming a Pleistocene colonization scenario which is
suggested by its recent date of divergence (about 1.4 Mya)

Schneider et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:105
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/105

from its southern sister species [21], we predicted that
populations might still show signs of the initial spatial
expansion into the IRS1. The occurrence of a range
expansion was confirmed by our spatial analyses, as none
of the samples significantly rejected the hypothesis of
spatial expansion (Model 1). Surprisingly, most samples
pointed to only one of the two different periods of expansion. Our modelling approach (Model 2) showed that two
successive spatial expansions in small-sized populations
generate a trimodal distribution similar to the observed
distributions. It may be surprising that Model 1 is not significantly rejected even when there are three modes in
the mismatch distribution. This can be explained by the
fact that the test is always picking up the bigger of the two
last modes as a signal of spatial expansion, without considering the smaller one (see Figure 2). The estimations
for the age of the expansion (Tau values, Table 2) also correspond to this largest mode. The fact that only very few
Tajima's D and no Fu's Fs values were significantly negative, may seem contradictory to the mismatch distribution results. This apparent contradiction may be
explained by the lower statistical power of these statistics
compared to mismatch distributions to detect spatial
expansions when local demes exchange only few
migrants (low Nm, which seems to be the case for M.
murinus) as demonstrated theoretically [29] and empirically in the eastern tiger salamander [30]. This is also confirmed by our simulations of the double expansion where
only 55.1% and 6.9% of the respective Tajima's D and Fu's
Fs were negative and only 3.7% and 0.0% of those values
were significant. Furthermore, a very recent simulation
study by Städler et al. [31] confirmed that even when
populations are undergoing a very important spatial
expansion, Tajima's D can exhibit positive values (apparently indicating a bottleneck). Finally, these tests may also
be affected by the recent fragmentation as noted above.
Altogether, these analyses show the limitations of single
statistics such as Tajima's D and Fu's Fs to detect demographic events when more than one such event has taken
place [31,32].
The fact that we pick up the signals of spatial expansions in the mismatch analyses suggests that they took
place relatively recently. It has already been suggested
that the Malagasy forest habitats underwent severe
changes during the Pleistocene due to climatic changes
associated with the glacial and interglacial periods [3,18].
Together with the estimate of 1.4 My for the last common
ancestor of M. murinus [21], it seems likely that M. murinus may have colonized the IRSs at its northern distribution range in the second half of the Pleistocene.
Based on the modes of the observed mismatch distributions expected under a spatial expansion model, it is possible to calculate rough estimates for the dates of these
two successive spatial expansions. Assuming a constant

Page 12 of 17

mutation rate of 10-6 per site per generation (one estimate
used for a closely related lemur species [33]) and using
the range of modes obtained for the samples, we can calculate the time of the expansions as tau*/(2×mu), where
tau* is the mode of the mismatch distribution and mu is
the mutation rate for the whole sequence. The first
expansion was thereby estimated to have occurred
between 26,500 to 33,500 years ago (modes between 24
and 30, Figure 2). The more recent expansion would then
have taken place between 3,300 and 14,000 years ago
(modes between three and 13). These estimations suggest
that two recent expansions took place rather recently, one
before and one after the last glacial maximum (LGM).
Apparently, some populations have kept memory of the
older and others of the more recent expansion, as was
predicted by our simulations (Figure 4).

Conclusions
Given the results of this study, the following scenario for
the colonization of IRS1 by M. murinus is proposed: One
ancestral population of M. murinus colonized the IRS1
probably before the last glacial maximum (LGM). M.
murinus may then have retreated when forests contracted
during the dry period associated with the LGM towards
the persisting riverine forests along the Mahajamba and
Betsiboka. It subsequently re-colonized the area (second
wave of expansion) in a period of recent forest expansion
following the LGM. This second spatial expansion is supported by the detection of a contact zone with high haplotype diversity, which parallels the events that were
described in several other species as a result of postglacial
expansions with subsequent admixture [34,35]. This contact zone is running through some central sites which
exhibit haplotypes from three different haplotypes clusters. This interesting and new hypothesis deserves further investigations and needs to be formally tested in the
future. In particular, the results obtained with our
mtDNA dataset must be confirmed and complemented
by other markers, such as nuclear STRs. Moreover, more
refined simulation work taking into account different factors such as environmental heterogeneity or uncertainties
about the mutation rate is needed to better define and
date these processes. Indeed, no reliable estimate for the
mutation rate is currently available for mouse lemurs.
Using a mutation rate of 10-7 [33], for example, would
increase the age of the expansions by one order of magnitude (265,000 to 335,000 yrs for the older expansion and
33,000-140,000 yrs for the younger expansion). Although
such a shift would still indicate a late Pleistocene dynamics, a reliable dating of these colonization processes
would enable us to understand in more detail the evolution of Madagascar's extraordinary biodiversity and the
underlying driving forces of diversification. So far, most
studies have emphasized the ancient processes that trig-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/105

gered the many radiations that occurred on this island
[36-38]. This is the first study detecting a potential
genetic signature of late Pleistocene and maybe even
postglacial biogeographic dynamics on this mini-continent. The further exploration of modern molecular modelling approaches may ultimately allow us to judge upon
the relative importance of certain Pleistocene climate
changes for the development of the biogeographic pattern that we can observe today. Mouse lemurs are an
extremely suitable model to explore these processes
across all Madagascar.

(5'-CACCATTAGCACCCAAAGCT-3') and H16498 (5'CCTGAAGTAGGAACCAGATG-3') [40]. The amplification of mtDNA followed the routines described in
Guschanski et al. [24]. Purification of amplified PCRproducts was performed with the Invitek purification kit
(MSB® Spin PCRapace) following the manufacturer's protocol. Sequencing was carried out by the company Macrogen (Seoul, South Korea, http://www.macrogen.com/
eng/macrogen/macrogen_main.jsp). Sequences were
analyzed with SeqMan II 6.00 (© 1989-2004 DNASTAR)
and subsequently cut to a uniform length of 455 bp. The
alignment of all sequences was constructed with the program Mega 4.0.

Study sites and samples

The study sites are located in northwestern Madagascar
between two major rivers, the Betsiboka in the south and
the Sofia in the north. The Mahajamba River divides this
area into two IRSs (IRS1 and IRS2, Figure 1). IRS1
includes the Ankarafantsika National Park (ANP) as well
as the isolated forest fragments Ste Marie, Tanambao and
Mangatelo. IRS2 contains the fragments Tsinjomitondraka and Maroakata. The ANP (S 16°19', E 46°48') is one
of the largest remaining forest areas in western Madagascar [12] and contains ten study sites (Figure 1). Two sites
(Beronono, Bealana) are still connected with the ANP
(Radespiel & Rakotondravony, unpublished data) and are
thus considered hereafter as being part of the ANP group,
even though they do not lie within the official borders of
the ANP.
The forest fragments differed largely in size (2 km2 40.8 km2) and were isolated from each other and the ANP
by variable stretches of savannah. Euclidean distances
between study sites ranged from 13 to 109 km with a
maximum distance of 68 km between sites within the
ANP. A total of 195 individual samples (ǩ: 106, Ǩ: 88, sex
undetermined: 1), collected between the years 2000-2004,
were available for this study. The number of individuals
per site varied between 3 and 27 (Tab. 1). Samples were
collected in form of ear biopsies (2-4 mm2) after capturing mouse lemurs systematically with Sherman Live traps
as described in Olivieri et al. [19]. Double sampling of
single individuals was prevented by marking all captured
animals with an individual ear-cut pattern. Capturing and
sampling protocols adhered to the legal requirements of
Madagascar and were approved by CAFF/CORE, the
"Direction Générale des Eaux et Forêts", and by ANGAP
(required for the sites in the Ankarafantsika National
Park).
Molecular methods

DNA was isolated from the ear biopsies using a standard
phenol/chloroform extraction [39]. A specified PCR for
mitochondrial D-loop sequences was conducted using
the universal mammalian control region primers L15997

Analysis of the genetic diversity and demographic history
of the populations

The number of haplotypes and the haplotype and nucleotide diversities (Nd, [41]) were calculated with the program DnaSP 4.0 in order to determine the genetic
variability within each population. Missing data or alignment gaps were not taken into account. Allelic richness
(AR(r)), corrected for sample size variations, was calculated for each population with a sample size >3 from haplotype frequencies using the rarefaction method
proposed by Petit et al. [42] with the software RAREFAC.
We used a simple regression (GLM Type II, sum of
squares) to test whether the number of haplotypes or
haplotype diversity could be explained by sample size.
Furthermore, a Mann-Whitney U-Test was used to determine if there was a difference in genetic diversity (Hd,
AR(r) and Nd) between the ANP samples and the samples
from isolated forest fragments. All tests were done using
the STATISTICA 5.5 software.
Tajima's D [43] und Fu's Fs [44] are known to be sensitive to departures from mutation-drift equilibrium due to
population size changes (expansions, bottlenecks) and
selection. They were thus computed for all samples using
the Arlequin v.3 software [45]. Following the recommendations in the manual, the Fu's Fs-statistic was regarded
as significant with a p-value lower than 0.02 instead of
0.05. Negative values of both statistics point towards population growth and/or positive selection, whereas positive Tajima's D values indicate bottlenecks and/or
balancing selection.
In addition to these tests, mismatch distributions were
constructed for polymorphic samples with a sample size
of at least 10 individuals. A mismatch distribution is the
distribution of the number of nucleotide mismatches
between all pairs of DNA sequences belonging to a population sample. The shape of the mismatch distribution has
been shown to be influenced by past demographic events
such as expansions and bottlenecks. The distribution is
usually bell-shape in populations having increased demographically in the past [46], while it shows one or two

Schneider et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:105
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/105

modes in populations having passed through a range
expansion, depending on the population density and the
amount of migrants exchanged with neighbouring populations [29].
Using the software Arlequin v.3, it is possible to formally test if a mismatch distribution rejects statistically
the null hypothesis of one spatial expansion, which we
call Model 1 hereafter. In this model it is assumed that a
population expanded spatially from one deme into a
larger area divided in same-sized demes interconnected
by gene flow. We estimated also estimated Tau, the time
of the expansion (in mutation units, Tau = 2 Tμ).
Because the mismatch distribution of all the samples
from IRS 1 taken together shows three different modes,
which is unexpected under Model 1, we investigated a
second model (Model 2), which consists of two successive
spatial range expansions interrupted by a (moderate) bottleneck (see below). Since no formalized test is currently
available for this model, we simulated data according to
Model 2 and visually compared the mismatch distributions generated to those observed. Simulations were carried out using the modified version of the SPLATCHE
software [47] described in Currat & Excoffier [48]. Basically, the simulation framework consists in two grids of
2,500 demes arranged in stepping-stone pattern as
described in Ray et al. [29]. Instead of simulating only one
spatial expansion, two successive spatial expansions were
simulated following the methodology detailed in Currat
[49]. The first expansion is simulated in one grid of demes
from a central deme. After the first grid has been fully
colonized, 50 individuals, taken from a peripheral deme,
start a new spatial expansion in the second grid (see Figure 8). Using the coalescent approach, sixty DNA
sequences of 450 bp are then drawn from four different
peripheral demes (two demes with 20 sequences each and
two demes with 10 sequences each). The chosen demes
vary in size and are located in the periphery to account
for the diverse sampling locations and sizes in the M.
murinus dataset and also because the IRSs studied here
are more likely to represent the periphery than the centre
of the expansion. This procedure allows us to simulate
the genetic diversity of mitochondrial sequences that
underwent an old spatial expansion, then passed through
a bottleneck, corresponding to the reduction in size of
viable habitat and finally through a more recent spatial
expansion into an empty territory. Parameters which correspond approximately to those estimated from our samples were chosen: the older expansion occurring about 30
mutational units of time in the past and the more recent
one 10 mutational units of time ago (see the mismatch
distribution results). We used a mutation rate of 10-6 per
site and per generation [33], a carrying capacity K equal
to 50 for all demes, a growth rate of 0.2 and a generation
time of one year. Using a migration rate of 0.1, the effec-

Page 14 of 17

tive number of migrants exchanged between demes at
equilibrium (Nm) is equal to 5.
Analysis of genetic structure

Genetic differentiation between populations was measured using ΦST. The model of Tamura & Nei [50] was
chosen with the gamma correction factor of 0.6354, as
determined with the program Modeltest 3.5 mac [51] on
the basis of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The
significance of these values was estimated with 1000 permutations as implemented in Arlequin v.3. A Mantel test
[52] was performed with XLSTAT v. 2007.7 in order to
investigate the relationship between geographic and
genetic distances (ΦST-values). The statistical significance was determined by means of 10,000 permutations.
An Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) was carried out in order to detect genetic structure generated by

Figure 8 Summary of the dynamics of the simulations of two successive spatial expansions. A first spatial expansion (upper graph) is
simulated in a subdivided population of 2,500 demes arranged as a
two-dimensional stepping-stone (50 × 50 demes). Each shade of gray
denotes the limit of the area of occupied demes at different steps of
the progression of the expansion (darker gray shows the first steps
while lighter gray shows the more recent steps). At the end of the first
spatial expansion a bottleneck is simulated in taking 50 individuals
from a peripheral deme from the first grid to start a second spatial expansion (lower graph) in an unoccupied grid. Red crosses show sampling locations at the end of the second spatial expansion.

the river Mahajamba, separating the two IRSs. For this
analysis, samples were divided into two groups corresponding to IRS1 und IRS2, which makes the results
directly comparable to study of Guschanski et al. [24] on
the other species of mouse lemurs in the area. The input
file was constructed with Seqtrans 1.1 (Dr. S. M. Funk)
and the AMOVA was performed with Arlequin v.3 [45].
Two populations with very small sample sizes (n < 5:
Bealana, Komandria) were excluded from this analysis.
The influence of the forest fragmentation on genetic
differentiation was tested for the populations in IRS1 by
comparing the pairwise ΦST values obtained between
populations separated by stretches of savannah (ANP
group vs. fragments and between fragments) and those
obtained for pairs of populations separated by a "continuous" forest habitat, i.e. within the ANP group including
Beronono and Bealana. Since geographic distance is a
confounding factor that may inflate "savannah" distances,
we only compared pairwise ΦST values for geographic
distances lower than the highest one found within the
ANP. Consequently, of the three fragments available,
Tanambao was excluded from the analysis due to its large
distance from the ANP. We regressed ΦST values against
geographical distances within the ANP and then compared the residuals obtained with those corresponding to
pairs involving a savannah crossing. If the savannah generated an increase in genetic differentiation we expect
that the savannah residuals should be more positive than
the ANP residuals (i.e. the ΦST values would be higher for
a similar geographic distance). The difference between
the two sets of residuals was tested using a permutation
approach (10,000 permutations). We also tested for a correlation between the residuals and geographical distances. These computations were performed with R [53]
partly with available and partly with self-written scripts.
Finally, for the analysis of genetic structure and haplotype sharing, a haplotype network was constructed with
the programme TCS 1.21 [54]. Clusters of closely related
haplotypes (connected by less than 10 mutation steps)
were identified and mapped geographically.
