Abstract
Background: Percentage Identity (PID) is frequently quoted in discussion of sequence alignments
since it appears simple and easy to understand. However, although there are several different ways
to calculate percentage identity and each may yield a different result for the same alignment, the
method of calculation is rarely reported. Accordingly, quantification of the variation in PID caused
by the different calculations would help in interpreting PID values in the literature. In this study, the
variation in PID was quantified systematically on a reference set of 1028 alignments generated by
comparison of the protein three-dimensional structures. Since the alignment algorithm may also
affect the range of PID, this study also considered the effect of algorithm, and the combination of
algorithm and PID method.
Results: The maximum variation in PID due to the calculation method was 11.5% while the effect
of alignment algorithm on PID was up to 14.6% across three popular alignment methods. The
combined effect of alignment algorithm and PID calculation gave a variation of up to 22% on the
test data, with an average of 5.3% ± 2.8% for sequence pairs with < 30% identity. In order to see
which PID method was most highly correlated with structural similarity, four different PID
calculations were compared to similarity scores (Sc) from the comparison of the corresponding
protein three-dimensional structures. The highest correlation coefficient for a PID calculation was
0.80. In contrast, the more sophisticated Z-score calculated by reference to randomized sequences
gave a correlation coefficient of 0.84.
Conclusion: Although it is well known amongst expert sequence analysts that PID is a poor score
for discriminating between protein sequences, the apparent simplicity of the percentage identity
score encourages its widespread use in establishing cutoffs for structural similarity. This paper
illustrates that not only is PID a poor measure of sequence similarity when compared to the Zscore, but that there is also a large uncertainty in reported PID values. Since better alternatives to
PID exist to quantify sequence similarity, these should be quoted where possible in preference to
PID. The findings presented here should prove helpful to those new to sequence analysis, and in
warning those who seek to interpret the value of a PID reported in the literature.

Background
Statistical measures of sequence similarity are routinely
applied to quantify the results of sequence database
searches [1,2]. However, having identified an interesing
similarity, it is common practice to quote a value of percentage sequence identity (PID) for the alignment. PIDs
may also be used in estimating phylogenetic trees from
multiple sequence alignments, but this application is not
addressed in this paper. PIDs are also frequently used as a
cutoff when removing redundancy from large sets of
sequences. At first sight, PID is a simple to understand
measure, but in fact there is no standard method to calculate the value. PID calculations reported in the literature
include those derived by dividing the number of identical
positions in the alignment by the number of aligned positions [3,4], dividing by the shortest sequence [5] or dividing by the length of the aligned region (aligned positions
excluding overhangs) [6]. When a PID value is quoted, it
is rare for the method of calculation to be reported as well,
but for the same alignment, each PID method may produce different values. Since PID is really a group of different similarity measures, it is important when interpreting
a reported PID to know what variation in PID may be
expected due to the differences in commonly used calculations. The value of PID is further complicated by the
observation that different alignment techniques when
applied to the same pair of sequences, or the same technique used with different parameters, may give alignments that show different values of PID. Together, these
factors make it difficult to judge the significance of a PID
value quoted for two protein sequences. This is a particular problem when comparing a PID value to general cutoffs for homology (e.g. [7].)
Recently, May[8] compared four different methods of calculating PID on a set of 9535 alignments derived from
3D-structure comparison to determine which were most
similar. He concluded that dividing the number of identities by the mean sequence length gave PIDs that were
most like PIDs calculated by other methods. However,
May[8] did not explicitly report the range of PID observed
for the same alignment, nor the effect of different alignment methods on the reported PID. Accordingly, in this
paper we have examined the range of PID expected due to
differences in the PID calculation method as well as the
effect of different alignment techniques. Our analysis suggests which PID calculation is most robust, and as

expected, indicates that PID by any method is a poor substitute for sequence comparison measures based on randomisation.

Results
Range of percentage identity seen for different PID
calculations
Out of 1028 aligned pairs there were only 20 pairs where
all four percentage identity measures had the same value.
711 pairs had differences in PID between 2% and 5%.
There were 87 pairs for which the difference was greater
than 5%. The greatest difference seen was 11.5%.

The difference between the maximum and minimum PID
decreases slightly with increasing minimum PID. Thus,
the average difference in PID for alignments with a minimum PID ≤ 30% was 3.3 ± 1.5 %, while the average difference for alignments with PID > 30% was 2.2 ± 1.5%.
PID2 was always largest since it considers only the aligned
positions. PID4 was ≤ PID1 on most of the pairs. Differences between PID4 and PID1 were observed in pairs
where one sequence overhangs at the N-terminal and
other at the C-terminal. For most of the alignments, PID3
was higher than PID1 or PID4. PID4 gave slightly more
consistent values of PID that were less prone to artefactually high or low values as a result of overhangs. PID4 also
gave a slightly better correlation with structural similarity
as shown in Table 1 and discussed below.
Range of percentage identity seen for different alignment
methods
Ideally, one would calculate the PID between two
sequences from the comparison of the protein three –
dimensional structures. In the absence of structures for
both proteins, sequence alignment techniques must be
applied. Since alignment of sequences is an optimisation
based on the parameters and algorithm, the resulting
alignment depends on these factors. Accordingly, the
range of PID4 was examined for the reference structural
alignment and for sequence alignments obtained by the
AMPS[9,10] alignment package with default parameters.
For most pairs of sequences, the sequence alignment gave
a higher PID4 than the reference alignment. This is to be
expected, since the sequence alignment algorithm aims to
produce an alignment that optimises sequence similarity,

while the reference structural alignment is the result of an
optimisation
of
structure
comparison.
In order to understand the effect of the alignment algorithm on the PID, the same sequence pairs were aligned
by AMPS [10], CLUSTALW [11] and GAP (GCG Version
9.1; which implements the Needleman & Wunsch, 1970
algorithm [12]) with default parameters. The difference in
PID4 was between 0% and 14.6%. Most of the pairs had
differences between 0% and 5%. A similar trend was
observed for PID1, PID2 and PID3 (data not shown). One
extreme example was the pair of domains linel-2 and 2hft2 for which PID4 was 3.9% for the GAP alignment, 11.7
% for the CLUSTALW alignment and 18.5% for the AMPS
alignment. However, none of these alignments agreed
with the reference structural alignment. Overall, the difference in PID4 decreases with the increase in minimum
PID4. Thus, the average difference for PID4 ≤ 30% was 2.5
± 2.1% and > 30% was 0.73 ± 0.9%. This simply reflects
the smaller dependency on parameters for alignments
between sequences of higher similarity.
In the real-world situation where one is comparing PID
values calculated in different ways by different algorithms,
the results presented here suggest the range in PID difference will be between 0 and 21.8 %. The average difference
for PID ≤ 30% was 5.3 ± 2.8% and > 30% was 2.7 ± 1.9%.

Discussion
In this article it has been shown that the PID value was
affected both by the way in which it was calculated, and
by how the alignment was generated. While neither of
these facts is particularly surprising, to our knowledge,
this is the first time the range of PID has been reported for
these effects. The combined effect of algorithm and calculation gave rise to differences in PID of up to 22%. Given
these limitations, which PID calculation gave the most
reliable estimate of similarity?
The STAMP structural comparison algorithm that was
used to generate the reference alignments in this study
provides a measure of structural similarity (Sc) which
takes account of distance and conformational similarity,
for each pair of proteins [13]. The correlation between Sc
and PID1 to PID4 when calculated for the reference alignment is shown in Table 1. PID2 was the least correlated (r
= 0.82), while PID4 was best correlated (r = 0.86), with
PID1 marginally worse (r = 0.85). This suggests the order
of reliability to be PID4 ≥ PID1 > PID3 > PID2. Table 1
also illustrates correlation values for PID1-4 for sequence
alignments generated by AMPS [10] for the same pairs of
proteins. Although the correlations are weaker, the trend
is the same. Two further measures of sequence similarity
were calculated for each pair of sequences. The Normalised Alignment Score (NAS) [9] was calculated by apply-

ing the BLOSUM62 matrix to the alignment, subtracting
penalties for internal gaps, then dividing by the number of
positions not aligned with gap. The Z-score was calculated
by shuffling each sequence 100 times and comparing the
shuffled sequences by the dynamic programming alignment algorithm [9]. The Z-score is given by:

Z-score =

(V − x )
σ

(1)

where, V is the alignment score for two sequences, σ and
x are the mean and standard deviation of distribution of
scores for shuffled sequences. The Z-score has the advantage over PID scores in that it corrects for the effect of
alignment length and sequence composition. Z-scores for
pair-wise sequence alignments may be converted to probabilities by applying the methods described by Webber &
Barton[14]. The correlation value of 0.84 suggests the Zscore to be the best measure of similarity in the absence of
a structural alignment, with NAS a close second.

Conclusion
In this paper we have quantified the variation in reported
percentage identity seen in 1028 structural alignments,
due to different denominators in the PID calculation and
due to alignment method. The overall conclusions are:
1. The four different PID denominators considered, gave
up to 11.5% difference in PID on a single alignment in the
test set.
2. Sequence alignments by three different methods
resulted in variation of up to 14.6% PID on a single alginment in the test set.
3. Combination of PID calculation and alignment
method led to variation of up to 22% PID on a single
alignment in the test set.
4. PID calculations that take account of gaps (PID1 and
PID4) were more highly correlated with the STAMP Sc
score for structural similarity between the proteins, than
those that do not consider gaps (PID2 and PID3).
5. All PID calculations were less well correlated with the
STAMP Sc score than the Z-score obtained by comparison
to shuffled sequence scores.
These overall conclusions are not surprising to those
expert in sequence analysis, but to our knowledge this is
the first time that the variation in PID has been quantified
explicitly. Quantification of the variation in PID is valuable, since although PID is a poor substitute for more
sophisticated scoring methods that take account of the

physico-chemical properties of the amino acids and correct for sequence length, PID remains widely quoted. The
findings presented here should prove helpful to those new
to sequence analysis, and as a guide to those who seek to
interpret the value of a PID reported in the literature.

In this study, all PID values were calculated over the complete alignment rather than the structurally conserved
core. This reflects the situation when aligning two protein
sequences where neither protein has a known threedimensional structure and so the structurally conserved
core is unknown.

Methods
Test data set
Protein domain families were taken from the OxBench
database of reference alignments [15]. OxBench contains
pair-wise and multiple sequence alignments for families
of proteins of known three-dimensional structure. The
alignment families in OxBench were selected by a process
of automatic structural alignment followed by manual
inspection and pruning. In this way, the structural alignments chosen for this study are likely to have higher confidence than alignments derived by a purely automatic
procedure. In addition, highly similar sequences (PID3 >
70) and short alignments (shortest sequence < 100) were
removed from the families. This left 1028 pairs of protein
three-dimensional structures which were aligned by the
STAMP structure comparison algorithm [13]. In order to
remove any dependency on pre-existing sequence alignments, STAMP was run in scan mode to find the optimal
starting transformation for each alignment.
