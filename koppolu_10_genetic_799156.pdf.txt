Genetic relationships among seven sections of
genus Arachis studied by using SSR markers

Abstract
Background: The genus Arachis, originated in South America, is divided into nine taxonomical sections comprising
of 80 species. Most of the Arachis species are diploids (2n = 2x = 20) and the tetraploid species (2n = 2x = 40) are
found in sections Arachis, Extranervosae and Rhizomatosae. Diploid species have great potential to be used as
resistance sources for agronomic traits like pests and diseases, drought related traits and different life cycle spans.
Understanding of genetic relationships among wild species and between wild and cultivated species will be useful
for enhanced utilization of wild species in improving cultivated germplasm. The present study was undertaken to
evaluate genetic relationships among species (96 accessions) belonging to seven sections of Arachis by using
simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers developed from Arachis hypogaea genomic library and gene sequences from
related genera of Arachis.
Results: The average transferability rate of 101 SSR markers tested to section Arachis and six other sections was
81% and 59% respectively. Five markers (IPAHM 164, IPAHM 165, IPAHM 407a, IPAHM 409, and IPAHM 659) showed
100% transferability. Cluster analysis of allelic data from a subset of 32 SSR markers on 85 wild and 11 cultivated
accessions grouped accessions according to their genome composition, sections and species to which they
belong. A total of 109 species specific alleles were detected in different wild species, Arachis pusilla exhibited
largest number of species specific alleles (15). Based on genetic distance analysis, the A-genome accession ICG
8200 (A. duranensis) and the B-genome accession ICG 8206 (A. ipaënsis) were found most closely related to A.
hypogaea.
Conclusion: A set of cross species and cross section transferable SSR markers has been identified that will be
useful for genetic studies of wild species of Arachis, including comparative genome mapping, germplasm analysis,
population genetic structure and phylogenetic inferences among species. The present study provides strong
support based on both genomic and genic markers, probably for the first time, on relationships of A. monticola
and A. hypogaea as well as on the most probable donor of A and B-genomes of cultivated groundnut.

Background
The genus Arachis has its origin in South America
where the species of this genus are widespread [1]. This
genus includes 80 species, 69 species described by Krapovickas and Gregory [1] and 11 species described by
Valls and Simpson [2]. Arachis is divided into 9 sections
(Arachis, Erectoides, Heteranthae, Caulorrhizae, Rhizomatosae, Extranervosae, Triseminatae, Procumbentes
and Trierectoides) based on morphology, geographic distribution and cross compatibility relationships [1]. Species present in sections Erectoides, Extranervosae and

Triseminatae and diploid species of section Rhizomatosae are believed to be basal in their divergence when
compared to the species in other sections [3,4]. Section
Arachis has 31 species out of the 80 species described.
Arachis has species cultivated for seeds and pods Arachis hypogaea, forage species Arachis pintoi, Arachis
glabrata and A. sylvestris [5] and ornamental species
Arachis repens [6].
Nearly all Arachis species are diploid (2n = 2x = 20),
but the cultivated groundnut is an allotetraploid (AABB)
(2n = 4x = 40) and is a member of the section Arachis,
which also includes another allotetraploid wild species,
Arachis monticola, which is the probable wild ancestor
of Arachis hypogaea [1,2]. Apart from section Arachis,

tetraploid species are also found in sections Extranervosae and Rhizomatosae (A. glabrata, A. pseudovillosa and
A. nitida). Tetraploids in section Rhizomatosae appear
to have similarities to the genomes of species in sections
Erectoides and Arachis [7]. Along with diploid and tetraploid species, three aneuploid species (2n = 2x = 18) (A.
decora, A. palustris and A. praecox) are also present in
this genus [8,9]. Diploid species have received particular
attention because they have great potential to be used as
sources for several agronomic traits, including resistance
to a variety of pests and diseases, drought resistance and
different life-cycle spans [6,10-12].
The cultivated species has arisen probably from a
unique cross between the wild diploid species Arachis
duranensis (A-genome) and Arachis ipaënsis (B-genome)
resulting in a hybrid whose chromosomal number was
spontaneously duplicated [13]. The hybridization and
chromosome duplication isolated cultivated groundnut
from its wild diploid relatives and natural introgression
of alleles from wild species into cultivated species has
not been demonstrated [14]. Thus the origin through a
single and recent polyploidization event, followed by
successive selection resulted in a highly conserved genome [15]. Polyploidy in sections Arachis, Extranervosae
and Rhizomatosae is believed to have originated independently [16]. Apart from A-genome and B-genome
species section Arachis has a lone D-genome species A.
glandulifera [17].
Even though extensive levels of morphological variations are observed in Arachis hypogaea, which is most
probably due to the variation in few genes [18], molecular markers have shown little polymorphism in the
germplasm of this species [18-20]. The low level of polymorphism observed in A. hypogaea can be attributed to:
(i) barriers to the gene flow from related diploid species
to domesticated groundnut as a consequence of the
polyploidization event [15], (ii) recent polyploidization
from one or a few individuals of each diploid parental
species, combined with self pollination [21], (iii) narrow
genetic base of cultivated germplasm due to use of few
elite breeding lines and little exotic germplasm in breeding programs [22,23] and (iv) unavailability of suitable
molecular marker system [24].
Microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) have
become one of the important classes of molecular markers in the recent past due to their high information
content and other features such as high reproducibility
and co-dominance [25]. As a result of considerable
efforts of several research groups at an international
level, several hundred SSR markers have become available in groundnut (see review by Varshney and colleagues) [24]. These SSR markers are very useful to detect
genetic variability in groundnut germplasm including
cultivated and wild genotypes [26-29] and have been

Page 2 of 12

used in the preparation of genetic linkage maps for
diploid [30,31] and tetraploid genomes [32] of groundnut. The majority of the SSR markers developed to date
are derived from the cultivated tetraploid (AB-genome)
groundnut using genomic DNA libraries. As development of SSR markers from genomic DNA libraries is a
labor intensive and expensive task, EST (Expressed
Sequence Tags) or gene sequences from the species or
even related species have also been used to develop SSR
markers in groundnut [27,33]. SSR markers derived
from genomic DNA or gene sequences have been found
useful to assess genetic variability in wild Arachis germplasm, which exhibit more variability compared to cultivated species [26,33,34].
The present study was undertaken to determine
genetic relationships among 96 accessions of 36 different species and 7 sections of Arachis by using the SSR
markers developed by Cuc and colleagues [28] from
genomic DNA library of cultivated groundnut and SSR
markers developed from gene sequences of aeschynomenoid/dalbergoid and genistoid clades of leguminosae
family by Mace and colleagues [27].

Results
Cross species transferability of SSR primer pairs

In the present study 82 Arachis hypogaea SSRs (Ah
SSRs) developed by Cuc and colleagues [28] and 19
cross species SSRs (CS SSRs) developed by Mace and
colleagues [27] were tested on 85 accessions of 35 wild
Arachis species and 11 cultivated A. hypogaea accessions, representing 7 different sections of the genus Arachis. Cross species transferability was scored positively
only when sharp band(s) were present. The average
transferability rate of 101 primer pairs (Ah SSRs and CS
SSRs) tested was 81% to section Arachis, but ranged
from 44% (Triseminatae) to 73% (Erectoides), to other
six sections with an average of 59% (See Additional file
1).
On an average, CS SSRs showed higher transferability
to accessions of different sections analyzed (88%) compared to Ah SSRs (76%) (Table 1). Five primer pairs
namely IPAHM 164, IPAHM 165, IPAHM 407a,
IPAHM 409 and IPAHM 659 were transferable to all
the accessions of different species tested. Some primer
pairs showed an interesting feature of amplification in
most of the accessions but no amplification in accessions of one section or species. For example the primer
pair IPAHM 466 did not show amplification in any of
the 17 accessions studied in section Heteranthae, while
it showed amplification in accessions of all other sections studied; this suggests either the mutation or small
deletion in primer binding sites of the primer pair for
this SSR locus or complete absence of this SSR locus in
section Heteranthae. On the other hand, IPAHM 176

Koppolu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:15
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/15

was not transferable to sections Caulorrhizae, Triseminatae and Extranervosae while it was transferable to all
the other sections. Apart from A, B, AB and D-genome
species of section Arachis which are phylogenetically
closely related, 88 primer pairs were transferable to species of section Erectoides and 54 primer pairs were
transferable to species of section Extranervosae (See
Additional file 1). The number of primer pairs transferable to species belonging to other sections is given in
the Additional file 1. Sizes of the fragments amplified by
the primer pairs were usually similar to those of the
donor species, suggesting that the amplicons were
derived from the same loci and that these allelic regions
of the primer binding sites are conserved, but 7 primer
pairs (37%) tested out of 19 CS SSR primer pairs, amplified products of higher molecular weight in some of the
accessions tested.
Alleles specific to different Arachis species

Based on the amplification events in A. duranensis (Agenome), A. ipaënsis (B-genome) and A. hypogaea (ABgenome) the primer pairs tested in the present study
can be grouped into three classes: (a) primer pairs
amplifying A. duranensis and A. ipaënsis and amplifying
putative alleles of both species in A. hypogaea; (b) primer pairs amplifying only A. duranensis but not A.
ipaënsis and amplifying putative A. duranensis allele in
A. hypogaea; (c) primer pairs amplifying A. ipaënsis but
not A. duranensis and amplifying putative A. ipaënsis
allele in A. hypogaea. Majority of the primer pairs tested
fell into the first class mentioned above. Since there has
been a controversy over the probable B-genome donor
for cultivated groundnut, our results strengthen the
hypothesis that A. ipaënsis is the most probable B-genome donor for the cultivated groundnut. Some primer
pairs amplified alleles specific to a particular species.
For example in case of CS SSRs, the primer pair 68_Stylo_SSR1-24, amplified a unique 600 bp allele in species

belonging to A. batizocoi (B-genome, section Arachis)
which is not present in any other species tested with
this primer pair, the same primer pair has amplified a
unique 580 bp allele in A. pintoi (section Caulorrhizae)
which is not present in any other species tested. The list
of primer pairs (39) amplifying a number of unique
alleles in different species and corresponding sections
are given in the Additional file 2. A. pusilla exhibited
largest proportion of species specific alleles (15, 14%,
section Heteranthae). Most of the species studied using
the SSR primer pairs exhibited unique alleles, indicating
the wide genetic base of the Arachis species. A. diogoi,
A. kempff-mercadoi and A. ipaënsis belonging to section
Arachis, A. hermannii belonging to section Erectoides
and A. kretschmeri and A. subcoriacea belonging to section Procumbentes did not show species specific alleles.
Alleles specific to different Arachis sections

Species belonging to section Arachis showed the largest
number of specific alleles (48, 47%), followed by section
Heteranthae (29, 29%) and species belonging to sections
Triseminatae and Extranervosae showed least number of
specific alleles (3, 3%). Four primer pairs IPAHM 461,
IPAHM 455, IPAHM 373 and IPAHM 334 amplified
fragments only in species of section Arachis with A-genome, B-genome, AB-genome and or D-genome indicating that they are specific to section Arachis. The primer
pair IPAHM 451, which is derived from genomic DNA
library of cultivated groundnut amplified in AB-genome
species but alleles corresponding to the A-genome and
B-genome were not observed in wild diploid progenitor
species indicating that this microsatellite locus/region
was created after the polyploidization event.
Locus duplication

Ten (IPAHM 531, IPAHM 91, IPAHM 105, IPAHM
117, IPAHM 176, IPAHM 183, IPAHM 320, IPAHM
377, IPAHM 659 and IPAHM 695) out of the 101 primer pairs tested amplified duplicated loci in tetraploid
accessions of Arachis section. The primer pair IPAHM
531, amplified 320 and 325 bp fragments in A. duranensis (A-genome), in A. ipaënsis (B-genome) it amplified a
300 bp fragment and in the tetraploid A. hypogaea and
A. monticola accessions both 320 and 300 bp fragments
were amplified, apart from these two fragments, another
fragment with 900 bp size was amplified in all the 11
accessions of cultivated tetraploid species A. hypogaea
and lone accession of wild tetraploid species A. monticola (ICG 13177). The 900 bp fragment amplified was
unique to tetraploid accessions and was not observed in
diploid species. Primer pair IPAHM 117 amplified a 200
bp fragment in both A. duranensis and A. ipaënsis
accessions and all the tetraploid accessions, apart from
this two additional fragments with sizes 400 bp (in ICG
7827, ICG 156, ICG 12625, ICG 12719, ICG 9930, ICG
2738, ICG 13942, ICG 15207, ICG 15206, ICG 10044,

ICG 7893, ICG 13177) and 405 bp (in ICG 9930, ICG
2738) were amplified in tetraploid accessions, which
were not observed in diploid species. The remaining primer pairs also amplified a unique second locus that was
specific to tetraploid accessions. All the primer pairs
that amplified a duplicated locus in tetraploid accessions
in this study belonged to Ah SSRs developed by Cuc
and colleagues [28] and none to CS SSRs developed by
Mace and colleagues [27].
Genetic diversity and relationships among the wild
Arachis germplasm

The Arachis germplasm surveyed by SSR analysis consisted of 96 accessions representing 36 different species
from sections Arachis, Caulorrhizae, Heteranthae, Procumbentes, Erectoides, Triseminatae and Extranervosae.
This set included 11 accessions of A. hypogaea that
helped in comparative analysis of wild accessions with
cultivated accessions. Although the level of transferability observed varied among the101 primer pairs used,
only 32 primer pairs showed amplification in at least
70% of accessions analyzed in the study. Therefore, genotyping data for 454 alleles obtained with these 32 primer pairs (Table 2) were used for constructing
dendrogram by using NJ-method (Figure 1). The dendrogram showed that all but seven wild Arachis accessions were grouped mainly according to their genomes
and sections. The seven accessions that were not
grouped by sections were: ICG 13262 (A. major, section
Erectoides), ICG 15164 (A. sylvestris, section Heteranthae), ICG 8209, ICG 8210, ICG 8211, ICG 8958 and
ICG 13160 (A. batizocoi, section Arachis). Out of the 36
species studied, except a few accessions of A. valida
(ICG 8193, ICG 13230), A. kuhlmannii (ICG 14864,
ICG 15144), A. sylvestris (ICG 15164) and A. cardenasii
(ICG 15176), all the other accessions were grouped with
respect to their species. For the accessions belonging to
these species, intraspecific variation was high, and as a
result, not all the accessions have clustered together.
The dendrogram has grouped different taxa into five
main clusters. Cluster I contained accessions of all Agenome species (A. cardenasii, A. villosa, A. diogoi, A.
duranensis, A. kempff-mercadoi, A. stenosperma, A. kuhlmannii and A. correntina), accessions of two B-genome
species (A. valida and A. hoehnei), one accession each
of sections Erectoides (A. major) and Heteranthae (A.
sylvestris) together with ICG 13262 and ICG 15164 discussed above. Cluster II contained accessions of all tetraploid AB-genome species, one accession of A-genome
species (A. kuhlmannii), one accession each of three Bgenome species (A. ipaënsis, A. magna and A.valida), all
the accessions of D-genome species (A. glandulifera), all
four accessions of A. pintoi (section Caulorrhizae) and
five accessions of A. sylvestris (section Heteranthae).
Cluster III included exclusively the species of section

Page 4 of 12

Procumbentes, A. kretschmeri, A. matiensis, A. rigonii, A.
subcoriacea and A. chiquitana. Cluster IV consisted of
all the five accessions of B-genome species (A. batizocoi), three species of section Erectoides (A. hermannii, A.
paraguariensis and A. stenophylla), the lone included
species of section Extranervosae (A. villosulicarpa) and
all the six accessions of A. dardani (section Heteranthae) together with the 5 misplaced Arachis batizocoi
accessions. Cluster V was formed by all the accessions
of A. pusilla (section Heteranthae) and A. triseminata
(section Triseminatae). Three accessions ICG 13214 (A.
benensis), ICG 8216 (A. cardenasii) and ICG 13246 (A.
vallsii), however, could not be grouped in any cluster/
sub-cluster.
The dendrogram constructed for different sections
based on allelic data from 32 SSRs could differentiate
the seven sections of Arachis (Figure 2). Sections Erectoides, Triseminatae and Extranervosae, which are
believed to be basal in their divergence, were clustered
close to each other and the sections Arachis and Procumbentes have diverged into two separate out groups.
Probable genome donors of cultivated groundnut

In order to verify the most probable genome donors for
A-genome and B-genome of cultivated groundnut, the
genetic distance between each diploid accession and all
Arachis hypogaea accessions as a group was calculated.
The distances obtained were compared to find the
accessions more closely related to the tetraploid accessions. Among all the A-genome species accessions
tested, accessions ICG 8200 (A. duranensis, distance:
0.114), ICG 8962 (A. diogoi, distance: 0.115), ICG 8204
(A. duranensis, distance: 0.117) have shown least distances to A. hypogaea. Among accessions of all B-genome species, accessions ICG 8206 (A. ipaënsis, distance:
0.083), ICG 8211 (A. batizocoi, distance: 0.104) and ICG
8209 (A. batizocoi, distance: 0.112) showed least distances to A. hypogaea. Genetic distances between other
A-genome and B-genome species, A. hypogaea and A.
monticola are given in Additional file 3. Clustering of
the accessions also revealed that the lone accession of A.
ipaënsis clustered closely with A. hypogaea accessions,
suggesting A. ipaënsis as the most probable B-genome
donor.

Discussion
SSR transferability

The transferability of SSR information from one species
to a related second species can be defined as the probability of success in PCR amplification using heterologous primer pairs designed for the first species [35].
Transferability of SSR markers between related species
is a consequence of the homology of flanking sequences
of the microsatellites and size of the region between the
primer pairs amenable to amplification by PCR. Previous

studies have demonstrated the conservation of SSR
sequences in plants [25,36]. The donor source of primer
pairs influences levels of transferability, which reflect the
genetic distance between the donor and target species.
Apart from this, some other factors such as mutations
in flanking regions, ploidy level [37], large intronic
regions in case of genic SSRs, template DNA concentration and PCR conditions used may complicate the relationship of transferability.
The present study employed a total of 82 Ah SSR primer pairs and 19 CS SSR primer pairs for transferability
across seven sections and 36 species of Arachis. In general CS SSR markers showed higher transferability to
accessions of different sections compared to Ah SSRs.
This difference was found statistically significant based
on Z-test (Z= 3.59, P < 0.05). This can be attributed to
higher conservation in genic regions from where CS SSR
markers were developed [27] as compared to less

conserved genomic regions from where Ah SSR markers
were developed [28]. Several other studies in past
reported the cross transferability of Arachis hypogaea
SSR markers in different species/sections of Arachis. For
instance, Hopkins and colleagues [14] observed cross
species amplification of Arachis hypogaea SSR markers
in Arachis monticola, Arachis duranensis and Arachis
ipaënsis. Moretzsohn and colleagues [26] observed cross
species amplification of Arachis hypogaea SSR markers
in different sections of Arachis (76% to species of section Arachis and 45% to species of the other eight sections). Similarly, Gimenes and colleagues [34] also
observed a cross transferability rate of 60 to 100% to
species belonging to different sections of Arachis using
Arachis hypogaea microsatellites. The higher rate of
transferability observed in our study can be attributed to
the use of larger number of SSR markers, and also the
conserved genic regions as origin of CS SSRs used.
Most of the primer pairs tested in the present study
amplified regions of expected product size in different
Arachis species. The reason for this can be explained by
the conservation of flanking regions and repeat
sequences in majority of the Arachis species, but seven
out of the twelve CS EST-SSR primer pairs amplified
products of higher molecular weight. The increase in
product size when using EST-SSRs is reasonable,
because the amplification is based on genomic DNA,
which may contain non-coding intronic regions between
exons and get amplified by using the primer pairs
designed from EST/genic sequences. Also the PCR

fragments amplified by using CS SSR markers were of
better quality with strong and distinct allelic bands than
those obtained by Ah SSR markers which have the problems like stuttering and faint bands. Better quality and
larger size of products than expected has been a characteristic feature of genic/EST derived SSR markers [36].
The average transferability rate of all the primer pairs
tested was higher to species of section Arachis presumably because species belonging to section Arachis are
phylogenetically more closely related to each other and
the source of most SSRs studied is section Arachis. The
least transferability rate was observed in case of section
Triseminatae a basally diverged species [3,4]. Apart
from these less transferability was also observed in section Heteranthae. The primer pairs IPAHM 164,
IPAHM 165, IPAHM 407a, IPAHM 409 and IPAHM
659 were transferable to all the accessions of different
species studied. This suggests that these SSRs arose
before speciation and are positioned in or near coding
regions with a conserved sequence across species. As
these five primer pairs were transferable to accessions of
all diploid species these can serve as informative markers in wild Arachis species. The primer pairs IPAHM
461, IPAHM 455, IPAHM 373 and IPAHM 334 were
transferable only to section Arachis, which comprise of
A-genome, B-genome, AB-genome and D-genome
species.
The use of SSR markers developed for one species in
genetic evaluation of other species considerably reduces
the time and cost involved in SSR development, since
the development of SSRs is expensive and time consuming. The transferable SSR markers identified in our
study could be very useful for genetic analysis of wild
species of Arachis, including comparative genome mapping [35,38], population genetic structure and phylogenetic inferences among different species. For using SSR
markers of one species in the evaluation of other species, our study recommends first to screen a large number of SSR markers developed in a particular species
and then identify the subset of most reliable markers
that amplify the expected amplicons in the other species. The number of cross transferable SSRs can be
increased by using SSR markers derived from EST or
genic sequences [36].
Arachis hypogaea - locus duplication

Ten Ah SSR primer pairs out of 82 analyzed amplified
more than one locus in tetraploid accessions of Arachis
section indicating loci duplication. For these A- genome
fragments as well as B-genome fragments were observed
but, one additional fragment was also observed in all the
tetraploid accessions. The nature of this extra fragment
remains to be determined. Amplification of more than
one fragment by one primer pair in tetraploid groundnut accessions has been reported in several other studies

Page 7 of 12

[14,29,34]. While developing the genetic linkage map for
tetraploid groundnut, Varshney and colleagues [32]
identified duplicated loci in the segregating population
for at least 5 markers and in case of the marker
TC3G01 they identified 3 different scorable segregating
loci in the population. Amplification of more than one
fragment by a primer pair can also be due to heterozygosity. However Arachis hypogaea is an allotetraploid,
and preferentially an autogamous species with a crosspollination rate of 2.5% [39].
Alleles specific to species and sections

Out of 101 primer pairs tested 39 primer pairs amplified
109 alleles, which are specific to different species and
sections of Arachis. For example A. pusilla exhibited the
largest proportion of species specific alleles (15, 14%,
section Heteranthae). It is also interesting to note that
accessions of most of the species that have amplified
unique alleles were originated from Brazil. According to
Stalker and colleagues [40], the centre of genetic variation for the genus Arachis is the Mato Grosso region of
Brazil to eastern Bolivia. However, when specifically
comparing A. hypogaea to other species, the greatest
probability of finding unique genes is in the North-Central, North-East, South and South-East regions of Brazil.
Accessions with unique alleles may be useful for introgressing diversity into cultivated groundnut, which has
narrow genetic base, for crop improvement. Further evaluation of these novel alleles may provide some association with useful traits for groundnut breeders.
The primer pairs IPAHM 461, IPAHM 455, IPAHM
373 and IPAHM 334 appear to generate SSR alleles specific to species of section Arachis which contains A-genome, B-genome, AB-genome and D-genome species.
The A-genome is characterized by a small chromosome
pair, the “A chromosome” [41]. The A-genome species
also have heterochromatic bands in all, or almost all, of
their chromosomes and are homogeneous in their gross
karyotype structure [42]. The B-genome species have a
symmetric karyotype, do not have the “A chromosome”
pair. These taxa are more diverse in karyotype formula
and in the presence and distribution of heterochromatin
[42]. Tetraploid species have an AABB genome constitution, and it has been demonstrated that they originated
by hybridization of two wild diploid species, one with
the A-genome and the other with the B-genome [43].
The D-genome is another described genome type for
the section Arachis and it has been proposed to be
exclusive to Arachis glandulifera [17]. Moretzsohn and
colleagues [26] identified one primer pair amplifying
alleles specific to A-genome species. These genome specific markers would be useful for identifying DNA fragments introgressed into another species. The primer
pair IPAHM 451 has amplified accessions of tetraploid
AB-genome species and did not show amplification in

Koppolu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:15
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/15

their wild progenitors and other species studied. This
indicates that these SSRs (genomic regions) probably
arose after the polyploidization event, which resulted in
tetraploid groundnut. Rapid genomic modifications
commonly occur in early generations of newly formed
polyploids and harmonize the different genomes in the
same nucleus [44]. These may result in either loss or
creation of new genomic regions.
Relationships among the wild Arachis germplasm

Knowledge of genetic relationships among various wild
species is necessary for successful and efficient exploitation of genetic diversity present in wild species, as the
wild species are known to harbor genes for resistance to
biotic and abiotic stresses [45,11]. It is easier to transfer
these specific genes from the species that are closely
related to the focal species than those that are distantly
related. In the present study genetic relationships
among 96 accessions representing 36 different species
from sections Arachis, Caulorrhizae, Heteranthae, Procumbentes, Erectoides, Triseminatae and Extranervosae
were established using data from 32 SSR markers. In
general, the SSR data grouped wild Arachis accessions
into similar genome/section/species groups with a few
exceptions. For example all the accessions of A-, ABand D-genomes of section Arachis and accessions of
sections Caulorrhizae, Procumbentes and Triseminatae
were clustered. For the species A. valida, A. kuhlmannii,
A. sylvestris and A. hoehnei, intraspecific variation was
high and as a result all the accessions of these species
could not be grouped together. The accession ICG
13177 from A. monticola species was grouped along
with A. hypogaea accessions and this grouping was supported by a bootstrap value of 100% (Figure 1). These
observations suggest high genetic similarity between A.
monticola and A. hypogaea species and are in agreement
with previous studies [46,47,26,34]. Except for IPAHM
93 and IPAHM 373, all the remaining primer pairs
tested amplified similar alleles in A. monticola and A.
hypogaea accessions. Earlier studies, by Krapovickas and
Gregory [1] reported fertile hybrids from crossing accessions of these two species. Therefore, our study together
with earlier studies [48,26] clearly suggests that A. monticola could be directly related to the allotetraploid
ancestral progenitor of A. hypogaea.
The present results agreed with the close relationship
between A. glandulifera, the lone D-genome species [17]
and B-genome species. Tallury and colleagues [49] while
studying the sequence data of plastid trnT-F region in
B-genome and D-genome species identified structural
changes in that region that are synamomorphic to the B
and D-genomes. They identified a 6-bp indel in this
region that is common to both the B and D-genomes,
whereas A-genome species have a characteristic 21-bp
indel in this region. Gimenes and colleagues [34] also

Page 8 of 12

while studying SSR markers in Arachis observed close
relationship between A. glandulifera and B-genome
species.
The accessions of A. decora (ICG 14934, ICG 14945
and ICG 14946) and A. palustris (ICG 15143) both having an aneuploid chromosomal number of 2n = 2x = 18
were grouped close to each other in the present study.
Similar results were reported by Bravo and colleagues
[47] while studying genetic relationships among different
Arachis species. These two species are phylogenetically
closely related and found to show no polymorphism on
their rDNA transcribed spacers [47]. The lone accession
of A. villosulicarpa ICG 8816 (section Extranervosae)
was grouped along with species of sections Erectoides
and Heteranthae. These observations indicate the close
relationships of species belonging to Extranervosae with
species of sections Erectoides and Heteranthae. In the
present study some species belonging to different sections were clustered together. For instance, some species
belonging to section Arachis were clustered with species
of section Erectoides and some species belonging to section Erectoides were grouped along with species of section Arachis. Such grouping of species belonging to one
section with species belonging to a different section may
be attributed to: (i) high levels of polymorphism
detected at the analyzed loci, (ii) occurrence of homoplastic alleles, i.e. alleles that present the same size (bp)
in a gel, are not identical by descent but identical in
their state [36] and are found in relatively distantly
related species, and (iii) allele sharing between species
belonging to different genomes, and (iv) similar geographic distribution of the accessions belonging to different species analyzed.
Information on genetic relationships among the wild
germplasm has implications for potential use of related
species in groundnut improvement and also estimates
on genetic relatedness can be useful for germplasm conservation efforts, selection of diverse parents for hybridization, and maximizing the range of genetic variability
employed in breeding programs.
Revisiting of genome donors to cultivated groundnut

The cultivated groundnut, Arachis hypogaea is believed
to be an amphidiploid produced by hybridization of an
A-genome species and a B-genome species followed by
subsequent chromosomal doubling. Although A. ipaënsis
was previously proposed as the probable B-genome
donor and A. duranensis as the probable A-genome
donor to the tetraploid Arachis species [13,43,50], these
propositions have been debatable. Therefore, the
obtained results on the accessions of A. ipaënsis species
in the present study have been critically analyzed.
The accession ICG 8206 representing A. ipaënsis species
was grouped closer to A. hypogaea accessions than to the
other B-genome species accessions. By using AFLP

Koppolu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:15
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/15

markers, Tallury and colleagues [49] also found clustering
of A. ipaënsis accession with A. hypogaea. Similarly, based
on AFLP and RFLP data, Gimenes and colleagues [51]
also demonstrated a close affinity of A. hypogaea/A. monticola to A. ipaënsis than to A. duranensis. Furthermore,
among all the B-genome accessions in the present study,
the accessions ICG 8206 (A. ipaënsis, distance: 0.083), ICG
8211 and ICG 8209 (A. batizocoi, distance: 0.104 and
0.112) showed least distances to A. hypogaea. These observations indicate a close relationship between them. Similarly, among all the A-genome accessions tested, the
accessions ICG 8200 (A. duranensis, distance: 0.114), ICG
8962 (A. diogoi, distance: 0.115) and ICG 8204 (A. duranensis, distance: 0.117) showed least distances to A. hypogaea. Therefore, our results strongly support that A.
ipaënsis and A. duranensis are the probable B-genome and
A-genome donors. It is also important to note here that A.
hypogaea is believed to originate from southern Bolivia to
northern Argentina. Although the accessions of A. diogoi
and A. batizocoi showed least genetic distances to A. hypogaea after A. duranensis and A. ipaënsis in our study, the
geographic location of these accessions does not support
their involvement in evolution of A. hypogaea (Figure 3).
In addition to that, the A. duranensis accession ICG 8200,
which showed least distance to A. hypogaea, is originated
from the Salta province of Argentina, the region which is
believed to contain A-genome accessions that are most
similar to A-genome of A. hypogaea[13].

Conclusions
The present study provides a set of cross species and
cross section transferable SSR markers for genetic studies of wild species of Arachis, including comparative
genome mapping, germplasm analysis, population
genetic structure and phylogenetic inferences among
species, avoiding the time and cost involved in development of new set of SSR markers. A large number of species/section-specific alleles as well as accessions
harboring unique alleles have been identified. This information will be very useful for groundnut community to
enhance the genetic base of cultivated groundnut after
systematic introgression of diversity from wild species.
Results obtained in the present study provided the
strong support based on both genomic and genic markers, probably for the first time, on relationships of A.
monticola and A. hypogaea species as well as on the
most probable donor of A-genome (A. duranensis) and
B-genome (A. ipaënsis) of cultivated groundnut based
on their genetic distances to A. hypogaea.
Methods
Plant material and DNA extraction

A total of 96 groundnut accessions, which represent 36
species, and 7 sections of the genus Arachis were

Page 9 of 12

selected for evaluation of genetic relationships and
assessing the transferability of SSR markers. Of the 96
accessions 11 accessions represent different botanical
types (see Additional file 4) of cultivated groundnut
Arachis hypogaea, and the remaining 85 accessions
represent 35 different species of the genus Arachis.
These accessions were obtained from RS Paroda Genebank at ICRISAT, Patancheru, India.
Total genomic DNA was isolated from unopened
leaves according to a modified CTAB-based procedure
[28]. The DNA quality and quantity were checked on
0.8% agarose gels and DNA concentration was normalized to ~5 ng/μl for PCR.
SSR markers

A total of 101 SSR primer pairs, 82 developed by Cuc
and colleagues [28] from the genomic library of tetraploid Arachis hypogaea (Ah SSRs) and 19 cross species
SSR primer pairs (CS SSRs) developed by Mace and colleagues [27] by in silico mining of gene sequences from
aeschynomenoid/dalbergoid and genistoid clades of
leguminosae family (see Additional file 5) were selected
for assessing the transferability across 7 sections of the
Arachis genus.
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)

PCR reactions for all the primer pairs were performed in
5 μl following a touchdown PCR profile in an ABI 9700
thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, USA). The PCR
reaction was performed on ~5 ng of genomic DNA with
2 picomoles of each primer, 2 mM of each dNTP, 2
mM MgCl2, 1× amplification buffer (Bioline, USA) and
0.1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Bioline, USA). The
touchdown PCR amplification profile has initial denaturation step for 3 min at 94°C followed first by 5 cycles
of 94°C for 20 sec, 65°C for 20 sec and 72°C for 30 sec,
with 1°C decrease in temperature per each cycle, then
followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 20 sec with constant
annealing temperature (59°C) for 20 sec and 72°C for 30
sec, followed by a final extension for 20 min at 72°C.
The amplified products were tested on 1.2% agarose gels
to check the amplification.
Electrophoresis and data collection

The PCR products amplified using DNA of wild and
cultivated species were electrophoresed on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (29:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) for 2 h at 800 V and visualized by silver
staining.
For checking transferability, data was collected as presence or absence of band at the locus amplified by the
particular primer pair. Presence of band was scored as
(+) and absence of band was scored as (-). For assessing
the genetic relationships among the accessions the amplified products were scored for the presence or absence of
alleles. The presence of allele was converted to 1 and the

absence of allele to 0. The approximate size of the product was determined based on a 100 bp ladder.
Analysis of cross species transferability and genetic
variation

The transferability of primer pairs was tested using 96
accessions representing 36 species from 7 sections of
Arachis. Since the Ah SSRs were derived from Arachis
hypogaea genome, accessions of Arachis hypogaea used
in this study were excluded for the assessment of transferability using these primer pairs, whereas for CS SSRs
developed by Mace and colleagues [27], Arachis hypogaea accessions were included for calculating cross
transferability. Percentage transferability was recorded as

percentage of amplification of the SSR markers amplified in different accessions tested.
For estimates of genetic diversity among cultivated
and wild groundnut germplasm, 11 accessions of cultivated groundnut and 85 accessions of 35 wild species
from 7 sections of Arachis genus were analyzed. A total
of 32 markers were used in this analysis (Table 2). The
0/1 binary matrix of the markers was used for the calculation of genetic distances using Nei and Li [52] distance
coefficient and further a Neighbor Joining (NJ) dendrogram was constructed using PAUP* 4.0b10 [53] and
Dendroscope [54]. The robustness of the phylogenetic

tree was evaluated by bootstrap analysis [55] with 1000
replicates using PAUP* 4.0b10.
