Abstract
Genetic analyses of viral samples from 74 laboratory confirmed measles cases occurring in Taiwan
during 1992-2008 identified six viral genotypes D3, D5, D9, G2, H1 and H2. The most frequently
detected genotype, H1, was associated with outbreaks in 1994 and 2002, and was the likely
indigenous genotype in 1992. In response to the outbreaks, two catch-up campaigns were launched
and a routine second dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine at entry to elementary school
was introduced. The vaccination campaigns successfully reduced the number of measles cases in
Taiwan, and many of the more recent cases can be traced to importations, primarily from other
Asian countries. A number of measles genotypes which were associated with outbreaks in other
Asian countries were detected among the more recent cases. The more recent genotype H1
viruses had sequences that were identical to those currently circulating in China or associated with
international importation of virus.

Background
Measles is a contagious human disease caused by measles
virus (MeV). Symptoms include high fever, conjunctivitis,
coryza, cough, the appearance of Koplik spots on the buccal mucosa and a maculopapular rash. Vaccination programs have dramatically reduced the incidence of measles
on a global scale [1,2]. Measles transmission has been
interrupted in the region of the Americas, and the Eastern
Mediterranean, European and Western Pacific Regions
have established elimination targets for the near future.
Despite the success of global measles vaccination programs, measles is still responsible for an estimated
245,000 deaths each year [3], with most of these deaths
occurring in developing countries. Sustained measles outbreaks continue to occur in developed countries that have

failed to maintain a high level of population immunity
[4].
As part of laboratory-based surveillance for measles,
genetic characterization of circulating wild-type viruses
provides an important tool for mapping transmission
routes, documenting the elimination of endemic strains,
and distinguishing vaccine reactions from wild-type infections [5-11]. In a given country or region, a genotype is
considered endemic if it is consistently associated with
outbreaks over an extended time period. On the contrary,
the identification of multiple genotypes associated with a
limited number of outbreaks and/or sporadic cases is
more consistent with multiple importations of virus than
with endemic virus circulation. This pattern of measles cir-

culation was described for the United States, Australia,
and Canada during the last decade [7,8,10,12,13].

veillance, laboratory confirmation was required for all
suspected cases. Starting in 2002, clinical specimens
including throat swabs, urine, and whole blood were also
obtained for virological surveillance.

Live attenuated measles vaccine was first introduced to
Taiwan in 1968, but no mass vaccination policy was
established. From 1978 to 1987, the vaccine was provided
to infants at both 9 and 15 months of age. In early 1988,
vaccination was scheduled for 12-months of age, but a
two-dose schedule (9 months and 15 months) was initiated later in the year because an outbreak occurred, and
this policy continued until 1991. In 1992, one dose of
measles vaccine was given at 9-months and a second dose
of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) was
administered at 15-months. Two catch-up campaigns
were implemented to improve coverage rates in response
to small outbreaks. From 1992 to 1994, the campaign targeted junior high school through preschool children
(birth cohort 1976/09 to 1990/09), while the campaign
of 2001 to 2004 was aimed at elementary school students
(birth cohort 1990/09 to 1994/09). The current two-dose
MMR program for 12-15 month old infants and first graders (6 years old) was implemented in 2006 [14]. The coverage rates with the first dose of measles vaccine among
children aged 13-24 months was 84% in 1993-94, and the
second dose MMR coverage rate improved from 69% in
1993-94 to 80-85% in 1995. Verifying immunization for
all entrants to primary school started in 1991, and by
1995, the overall vaccine coverage with at least one dose
of MMR in primary schoolchildren was 96% [15].

In this study, the viral genotypes associated with 74 confirmed cases of measles that occurred in Taiwan between
1992 and 2008 were determined.
Sixteen sequences were obtained from viral isolates and
the others were obtained directly from clinical samples.
Therefore, this is the first report that describes the molecular epidemiology of MeV in Taiwan.

Results
Epidemiology
Measles was listed as a reportable disease since 1985 and
information regarding measles infections before 1985 is
incomplete. From 1985 to 1992, four major measles outbreaks occurred in Taiwan (Figure 1) in 1985 (2,219
cases), 1988 (1,386 cases), 1989 (1,060 cases) and 1992
(303 cases). The epidemic in 1985 resulted in 97 deaths
with reported case fatality rate of 4.4%, whereas the epidemic of 1988-89 was associated with 12 deaths and a
case fatality rate of 0.5%. The high mortality rates associated with the outbreaks in 1985 and 1989 were likely due
to under reporting of the cases. In an outbreak investigation among elementary and junior high schools in northeastern Taiwan in 1989, the reporting of measles by
physicians was only 6.1% [16]. Beginning in 1993, the
annual number of reported measles cases was below 100,
the annual number of laboratory confirmed measles cases
averaged 8.6, with a range of 0-33 cases. There were no

In 1985, measles was listed as a reportable disease in Taiwan, but routine serologic confirmation of infection was
not started until 1991. In 2000, to strengthen measles sur2400

laboratory confirmed cases for years of 1995, 1996, 1999,
and 2004 (Figure 1).

source of the virus was not identified, a linkage to Indonesia or Malaysia is speculated (Figure 2).

Genotyping
Genetic analysis was conducted on 74 measles cases
(Table 1) and 4 vaccine reactions that occurred between
1992 and 2008. Genotype information on MeVs that circulated in Taiwan before 1992 is not available. The six
genotypes were detected among the 74 measles cases
included D3, D5, D9, G2, H1, and H2 (Table 1). Four
sequences from genotype A were obtained from patients
who presented with rash following vaccination.

Genotype H1 was detected in 50 of the 74 samples from
cases occurring during 1992-2008. In 1992, genotype H1
sequences belonged to two lineages within what has been
described as genotype H1, cluster 1 [25] (Figure 3). Two
H1 sequences obtained in 1993 were identical to one of
the sequences detected during the previous year (MVs/
Keelung.TWN/18.92/3). Four identical genotype H1
sequences were obtained from the Taoyuan area in 1994.
The only H1 sequence detected in 1997, MVs/Taipei.TWN/36.97, was very closely related (99% identity) to
Chinese viruses detected in 1995, MVi/Hunan.PRC/
15.95/9 (DQ356792) and MVi/Hunan.PRC/18.95/18
(DQ356791). One genotype H1 sequence was detected in
2000, but information regarding the source of infection
was not available. During 2001, six cases were confirmed
as genotype H1. Three of these cases had traveled to China
7-21 days before onset of rash and the sequences from the
six cases were distributed over three different lineages
(Figure 3).

Molecular characterization
Genotype D3 was detected in five cases, and three of these
(1 in 2002, 2 in 2003) were travelers from the Philippines
(Figure 2). All of the genotype D3 sequences were placed
within the same cluster as the reference strain, Illinois.
USA/89.1, and more divergent from an earlier D3
sequence, MVs/Taipei.TWN/94 (AJ250068) [17], which
was closely related to the Japanese strains (D87485,
D87486, and D87490) detected in 1989.

Genotype D5 was detected in nine cases in Taiwan. Genotype D5 has been reported to be circulating in Thailand
and had been associated with cases in Japan and imported
cases in the USA [18,19]. The source of virus for three of
the cases (one each in 1992, 2000, and 2002) was not
identified. The other six cases had sequences that were
more closely related to the Bangkok reference strain than
to the Palau reference strain (Figure 2). Of these six cases
with genotype D5 detected, one case was imported from
Thailand, one from Germany, and the four more recent
cases in 2007-2008 were imported from Japan.
The genotype D9 sequence from 2003 was obtained from
a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Japan for 10
days before onset of clinicalsymptoms. Three other D9
sequences were obtained in 2008, one was from 4 year old
girl who traveled to the Philippines 13 days before rash
appeared. The other two cases from 2008 were from the
same household including a 25 year old man who had
traveled to Thailand 10 days before rash onset and then
transmitted virus to his 10 months old niece. Genotype
D9 was initially detected in East Timor and Java, Indonesia [20,21] and has recently been associated with outbreaks in Japan [22].
Genotype G2 was first identified in 1997 in Indonesia and
Malaysia [23,24]. The three genotype G2 viruses detected
in Taiwan in 1997 shared identical sequences and were
closely related to the sequence of the reference strain for
genotype G2, MVi/Amsterdam.NET/49.97 (AF171232),
which was isolated from secondary cases of measles associated with an index case from Indonesia. Though the

There were 26 measles cases confirmed by serology in
2002, and 10 cases were from a school outbreak that
occurred from September to October. There were 17 cases
with sequence information and 15 of the H1 sequences
belonged to 3 different lineages. Of those, 3 were
imported from China (MVs/Taipei.TWN/26.02, MVs/Taipei.TWN/27.02, and MVs/Pingtung.TWN/33.02). Nine of
the H1 isolates associated with the 2002 outbreak (six of
these were either household or school clustering) had
identical sequences and formed a separate lineage (Table
1, Figure 3) which included identical sequences from
viruses isolated from Japan and China, MVi/Tokyo.JPN/
23.01 (AB095428), MVi/Fuji.JPN/21.02 (AB095430),
MVi/Kawasaki.JPN/36.01 (AB095429), MVi/Shanxi.PRC/
13.02/1 (DQ356858), and MVi/Shanghai.PRC/30.02/1
(DQ356839), suggesting that these viruses were introduced by importation.
The genotype H1 sequence detected in 2003 was from an
eleven months old infant returning from a visit to China.
The two cases with genotype H1 in 2005 were in the same
family and there was no history of travel. The six genotype
H1 sequences detected in 2006-2007 were all imported
from China (Table 1). Among the eight genotype H1
sequences detected in 2008 (Table 1), four had a travel
history to China. The case associated with MVs/Kaohsiung.TWN/45.08 was responsible for nosocomial transmission in two hospitals and the index case represented
by MVs/Kaohsiung/52.08 was identified later. In this outbreak, eight cases were confirmed and only four had adequate samples for PCR testing. One of the genotype H1
sequences obtained in 2008, MVs/Taoyuan.TWN/29.08,

was detected by the laboratory surveillance system but no
source was identified. A search of GenBank found an identical sequence from case reported in Hong Kong, MVs/
HongKong.CHN/17.08 (EU870594). Therefore, there
were multiple introductions of genotype H1 viruses into
Taiwan from China and the epidemiologic information
documented importation for 17 of 50 cases. The
sequences from the recent genotype H1 viruses that were
imported into Taiwan showed 100% sequence identity
with genotype H1 viruses that were circulating in China or
were associated with international importation of virus.
For example, MVs/Tainan.TWN/33.07 (EU914238) had
100%
identity
with
MVi/Sichuan.PRC/28.04/1
and
MVi/Chongqing.PRC/20.04/1
(EU557230)
(EU557209). MVs/Tainan.TWN/31.07/1 (EU914237)
shared identical sequences with MVs/Aberdeen.GRB/
MVi/Shanghai.PRC/22.06/11
10.06
(EF079131),
(DQ902857) and MVs/Oregon.USA/8.06 (DQ888762).
Among the 50 H1 sequences characterized, forty-five cases
were clustered with the reference strain for genotype H1
(Figure 3) and the other five cases, displayed in a separate
lineage, were closely related to two genotype H1 viruses
from China, MVi/Hunan.PRC/18.95/18 (DQ356791)
and MVi/Hunan.PRC/15.95/9 (DQ356792).
Only three cases were confirmed to be associated with
genotype H2, one was in 1994 from the Taoyuan outbreak
and the other two were from an outbreak in a hospital in
1998. Although no information regarding the source of
these cases was available, these are more closely related to
the isolates from Vietnam [26].

Discussion
Historically, clade H of MeV was associated with Asian
countries, with genotype H1 being prevalent in China
[27], and genotype H2 linked to Vietnam [26]. Baseline
virological surveillance was not conducted in many Asian
countries so the exact distribution of the clade H viruses
in the pre-vaccine era is unknown.
This report contains the first analysis of the genetic characteristics of MeVs circulating in Taiwan over the seventeen year period from 1992 to 2008. In Taiwan, measles
vaccination started in 1978, but epidemiologic information was not available until 1991. Laboratory-based surveillance was initiated in 1991, but routine virological
sampling did not occur until 2002. Before 2000, only
serum samples were collected and the percentage of sampling from all reported cases was variable (range: 52% to
85%). The low sampling rate from 1995, 1996, and 1999,
of 59.5%, 59.6%, and 52.2% respectively, could have contributed to the absence of confirmed measles cases for
those years.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/219

Even though virological surveillance was not conducted in
Taiwan before 1992, the data presented here suggest that
MeV genotype H1, the most frequently detected genotype
in the study, represented the indigenous genotype in Taiwan. Genotype H1 viruses were detected almost every year
beginning in 1992 with the exception of 1995, 1996,
1998, 1999, and 2004 (Table 1). Importation of measles
from China was evident beginning in 2001 and accounted
for 10 of 14 detections of genotype H1 after 2006. It is
interesting to note that genotype H1 viruses were detected
in Taiwan before they were documented in China. It is
also possible that genotype D3, which was an indigenous
genotype in Asian countries including the Philippines,
could have been an endemic genotype in Taiwan at one
time [17] although D3 was only detected twice in 1992
and 2000.
Recent virological surveillance has documented the
spread of MeV in the Western Pacific Region. A large measles outbreak that occurred in Korea in 2000 was caused
by genotype H1 viruses [28] and genotypes H1 and D9
were imported into Japan [22,29-32]. The most recent
outbreaks in Japan were due to importation of genotype
D5 [33]. This report documents the importation of MeV
into Taiwan which began to introduce the foreign laborers
from countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam in the beginning of 1989. The number
of foreign workers reached 330,000 by end of 2006,
accounting for 1.4% of the total population. The multiple
genotypes and sporadic cases detected after 2003, except
for two cases in 2005, and one in 2008, were all documented to be the result of importation and the genotypes
detected, D3, D5, D9, G2, H1 and H2, are or were circulating in nearby Asian countries. The observation that two
genotypes, H1 (4 cases) and H2 (1 case), were detected in
the 1994 outbreak implied that there were at least two different chains of transmission associated with the outbreak.
In the dendrogram derived from the N gene sequences
(Figure 3), two clusters of sequences within genotype H1
were observed. The majority of the sequences were more
closely related to the H1 reference strain and related
viruses have been detected on an ongoing basis in China
where this group of viruses is referred to as cluster 1 [25].
Five of the sequences from Taiwan, including MVs/Taipei.TWN/36.97, MVs/Taoyuan.TWN/45.01, MVs/Taipei.TWN/26.02, MVs/Taichung.TWN/36.02/1, and MVs/
Taipei.TWN/36.02/2, were clustered together and were
more distinct from H1 reference strain. This group of
viruses has also been detected in China and is referred to
as cluster 2 [25,34].
The diversity of genotypes and the low number of cases in
Taiwan is similar to what has been described in other

countries that are in elimination phases of measles control [9,10,12,13]. The situation in Taiwan is different from
some other countries in the elimination phase because the
genotype H1 is continually being reintroduced by importation from neighboring Asian countries, so it is difficult
to document interruption of transmission of the suspected indigenous genotype. However, both molecular
and epidemiologic data were used to link the more
recently detected genotype H1 viruses to international
importation. While virological surveillance will help to
document the sources of measles cases, formal documentation of elimination will depend on meeting a number of
criteria, from both laboratory-based and epidemiologic
studies. Of course, the nosocomial measles outbreak that
occurred in 2008 highlighted the vulnerability of infants
younger than 12 months of age, unimmunized adults,
and the high risk of importation associated with international travel. These events underscored the importance of
strengthening immunization programs, disease surveillance, and laboratory confirmation.

Conclusion
This study reported the first analysis of the genetic characteristics of MeVs circulating in Taiwan over the seventeen
year period from 1992 to 2008. Genetic analyses of viral
samples from laboratory confirmed measles cases identified six viral genotypes D3, D5, D9, G2, H1 and H2. Genotype H1 remains the most frequently encountered MeV
transmitted among Asian countries. Recent measles cases
were epidemiologically linked to the importation from
foreign countries. These results highlight the importance
of integration of immunization programs, disease surveillance systems, and laboratory diagnosis.

Materials and methods
Clinical Specimens
Specimens including throat swabs, urine, whole blood, or
serum were collected from suspected cases and tested in
the laboratory at the Taiwan CDC. During the period of
1992-2008, various specimens from 896 suspected
patients were collected for laboratory tests. Specimens
were processed with RT-PCR amplification from a total of
174 patients, including 42 with only one serum collected
at the acute phase and tested negative for measles IgM and
IgG, the other 132 cases were serologically confirmed with
positive measles IgM. Finally, 74 confirmed measles cases,
including 16 virus isolates, were sequenced and used for
genetic characterization. Here, a confirmed case is defined
serologically either by a positive IgM, or a significant rise
(4× or higher) of IgG titer between acute and convalescence phase, or a positive RT-PCR result from various clinical samples (serum, throat swab or urine). Any confirmed
case that has travel history abroad 7-23 days before onset
of rash is classified as an imported case [35].

Serological Testing
Serum specimens were tested for measles IgM and IgG
antibodies using Enzygnost Anti-Marsen-Virus/IgM,
Enzygnost Anti-Marsen-Virus/IgG (Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions.
Virus Culture
Clinical specimens including throat swab, urine sediments and lymphocytes were inoculated onto B95a cells,
a marmoset B lymphoblastoid cell line transformed by
Epstein-Barr virus [36], and observed for the presence of
cytopathic effect (CPE). Inoculated cells were blind passaged up to two times before discarding those with no evident CPE.
Molecular Analysis of Measles Virus
RNA was extracted from infected cells or directly from
clinical specimens by using the Viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) following the manufacturer's
instructions. To obtain the sequence of the 450 nt region
of the measles N gene that is required for genotyping, RTPCR was performed by using a one-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) with reverse primer MV64 (nt 1719-1739, 5'TATAACAATGATGGAGGGTAG-3') and forward primer
MV59 (nt 866-889., 5'-GATATGTGACATTGATACATATAT-3'). Primer concentration was 0.4 μM each. The PCR
cycling conditions were reverse transcription at 50°C for
30 min, initial PCR activation step by 95°C for 15 min,
followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 51°C and 1
min at 72°C, with a final extension for 5 min at 72°C. A
nested PCR was then performed on the resulting PCR
product of 873 bps using HotStartTaq Master Mix Kit
(Qiagen) with primers MV60 and MV63 (0.2 μM each) as
described elsewhere [37], and the cycling conditions were
95°C for 15 min followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30
s at 63°C and 1 min at 72°C, with a final extension for 5
min at 72°C. Sequencing reactions were performed by
using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready
Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems, Forster City, CA) with
the same primers as those used for the nested PCR. Nucleotide sequences were analyzed with MegAlign version
3.1.7. Phylogenetic trees were drawn with MEGA version
4.1 by neighbor-joining using 1000 bootstrap replicates.
The wild-type MeV isolates and genotype sequences from
Taiwan were named as recommended by WHO [38]. The
WHO-designated reference sequences [39] for each genotype were obtained from GenBank.
