Abstract
Background: Bacterial genomes develop new mechanisms to tide them over the imposing
conditions they encounter during the course of their evolution. Acquisition of new genes by lateral
gene transfer may be one of the dominant ways of adaptation in bacterial genome evolution. Lateral
gene transfer provides the bacterial genome with a new set of genes that help it to explore and
adapt to new ecological niches.
Methods: A maximum likelihood analysis was done on the five sequenced corynebacterial
genomes to model the rates of gene insertions/deletions at various depths of the phylogeny.
Results: The study shows that most of the laterally acquired genes are transient and the inferred
rates of gene movement are higher on the external branches of the phylogeny and decrease as the
phylogenetic depth increases. The newly acquired genes are under relaxed selection and evolve
faster than their older counterparts. Analysis of some of the functionally characterised LGTs in
each species has indicated that they may have a possible adaptive role.
Conclusion: The five Corynebacterial genomes sequenced to date have evolved by acquiring
between 8 – 14% of their genomes by LGT and some of these genes may have a role in adaptation.

Background
Bacterial genomes are constantly under pressure from the
selective challenges of their surroundings. To overcome
these hardships, bacterial genomes evolve via mechanisms in the form of genome modifications by gene loss
[1-3], gene genesis by duplication, modifying existing
genes by mutations [4,5] or acquisition of new genes by
lateral gene transfer (LGT) [6-13]. Recent studies indicate
that LGT has a larger role in bacterial evolution than previously anticipated [14-19], accounting for anywhere
between 1.6 – 32.6% of the genes in each individual
genome [20].

Gene content varies dramatically even among strains
belonging to a single bacterial species [21-23]; variations
mostly resulting from gene loss [1-3] and/or acquisition
of new genes by LGT [6-13]. LGT plays a significant role in
the evolution of bacterial genomes and provides them
with a ready-to-use novel gene pool that helps them to
adapt faster to their ever changing surroundings and foray
into new ecological niches. Documented evidence shows
that laterally acquired genes can transform an otherwise
avirulent bacteria into a virulent form [24,25], protect
pathogenic bacteria against antibiotics [26], increase the
metabolic diversity of the recipient bacteria [12,27-29] or

confer on it abilities to explore new challenging niches
[30,31]. Keeping in mind the capability of LGTs to provide diverse adaptive features, we review some of the previous work done on lateral gene transfer in bacteria with
an emphasis on the adaptive role of these laterally
acquired genes. We also provide evidence about the transient nature of most of the laterally acquired genes based
on a maximum likelihood modeling of the gene insertions/deletions at various stages during the evolution of
the Corynebacterium species.
For the ease of discussion, we have classified the adaptive
features into three major categories and will review each
in turn: (1) Pathogenicity related features (2) Metabolic
capabilities and (3) Survival under extreme environmental conditions.
Pathogenicity related features
There are many documented instances of the acquisition
of virulence determinants in bacteria by the process of
LGT [22,25,32-38], selected examples are discussed
below. The acquisition of a 35 kb eaeA locus encoding
proteins responsible for attaching and effacing lesions has
transformed an avirulent Escherischia coli strain into an
enteropathogenic strain [39], whereas the acquisition of
pathogenicity islands (PAIs) ranging from 70–150 kb and
encoding virulence realted proteins resulted in uropathogenic strains [40,41]. Lawrence and Ochman [7] have
identified that about 18% of the genome of E.coli
MG1655 was acquired by LGT and this laterally acquired
DNA has "conferred properties permitting E.coli to
explore otherwise unreachable ecological niches".

The genome of Salmonella enterica has two laterally
acquired pathogenicity islands, SPI-1 and SPI-2 encoding
proteins that help in apoptosis, entry into non-phagocytic
cells and systemic infection [42], whereas Bacillus cereus
genome has three laterally acquired genomic islands
BCGI-1, BCGI-2 and BCGI-3 with genes encoding proteins responsible for antibiotic resistance, ferric anguibactin transport system and lantibiotic biosynthesis leading
to a better survival of B. cereus inside the host [43]. The
highly pathogenic strains of Yersinia pestis have a 102 kb
High Pathogenicity Island (HPI) that contains the hms
locus encoding the capacity to store hemin, yersinibactinpesticin receptor and an iron-regulated high molecular
weight protein enabling an increased level of pathogenicity and survival in their hosts [44]. The case with the cag
pathogenicity island in Helicobacter pylori is similar. This
laterally acquired region encodes many antigenic determinants and virulence factors indicating its role in pathogenesis [45].
A comparison of the virulent and benign strains of Dichelobacter nodosus, a principal causative agent of the ovine

footrot, revealed that the acquisition of vap and vrl regions
encoding several virulence related genes has transformed
an otherwise benign strain into a virulent strain [46,47].
Similarly, the virulent strains of Vibrio cholerae acquired a
45 kb PAI that includes the tcp-acf gene cluster involved in
colonization and the toxT gene involved in the regulation
of cholera toxin. This region, absent in the corresponding
avirulent strains, plays a role in virulence and host adaptation [48].
This data indicates the ability of the laterally acquired
genes to transform an otherwise non-pathogenic bacteria
into a pathogenic bacteria. Interestingly, all the examples
involve the acquisition of an adaptive trait, virulence, by
acquiring large islands of linked genes.
Metabolic adaptations
Primary metabolism
A recent study on the evolution of metabolic networks in
E. coli by Pal et al [27] suggested that most of the laterally
acquired genes have specific adaptive roles. Another study
based on subtractive hybridisation by Espinosa and Kolter
[49] has shown that the laterally acquired gapC gene has
an adaptive role in the survival of E. coli in aquatic environments. Jahreis et al [50] demonstrated that the acquisition of the CTscr94 locus (consisting of scr genes that
encode a phosphoenol-dependent phosphotransferase
system involved in the sucrose fermentation pathway)
broadens the metabolic versatility of Salmonella senftenberg and confers on it the capability to utilise sucrose as
the sole carbon source. Sullivan and Ronson [28] have
demonstrated that the laterally acquired 500 kb symbiosis
island from Mesorhizobium loti ICMP3153 confers symbiotic ability to non-symbiotic Mezorhizobium strains and
enables the bacterium to expand its genome to exploit
new environmental niches. Similarly, the acquisition of
the cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation (nif) genes by
Wolinella succinogenes might enable it to survive in environments outside the host [29].
Degradation of xenobiotics
The ability to degrade xenobiotics is a relatively new physiological development in bacteria and several instances of
the adaptability of the bacterial communities to xenobiotics have been attributed to the acquisition of genes related
to xenobiotic degradation by LGT [12,51,52].

Pseudomonas sp. strain B13 has a genomic island of about
105 kb containing the chlorocatechol degradative (clc)
genes that have the ability to degrade 1,2-dichlorobenzene (CB). Ravatn et al [53] have demonstrated that the
acquisition of the B13 specific clc genes by Pseudomonas
putida increases its metabolic diversity and results in a better adaptation to higher concentrations of CB. Dejonghe
et al [54] have demonstrated that the transfer of 2,4-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7(Suppl 1):S8

dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) degradation plasmids pEMT1 and pJP4 from P. putida UWC3 into the
indigenous bacteria of two different horizons of 2,4-D
contaminated soil enhanced the ability of the native bacteria to degrade 2,4-D, whereas de Lipthay et al [55] have
demonstrated that lateral transfer of the gene (tfdA)
encoding 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid dioxygenase
into Ralstonia eutropha and other indigenous phenol
degrading strains enhances the phenoxyacetic acid degradative capacity of the recipient strains in soil.
Poelarends et al [56] have indicated that the acquisition of
the haloalkane dehalogenase gene (dhaA) was the key factor in the evolution of the haloalkane degradation ability
of Rhodococcus rhodochrous, Pseudomonas pavonaceae and
Mycobacterium sp. Similarly, the acquisition of the pcpB
gene encoding pentalchlorophenol-4-monoxygenase by
Sphingomonas chlorophenolicum confers on it the ability to
degrade 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol and survive under high
concentrations of this chemical compound [57].
From the examples discussed above it is clear that some of
the laterally acquired genes have the ability to increase the
metabolic diversity of recipient bacteria enabling them to
explore new ecological niches.
Survival under extreme environmental conditions
The genome sequence of the radiotolerant bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans has revealed that topoisomerase IB (that
plays a role in recombination and for which a knockout
mutant is more sensitive to UV radiation) and RNA-binding protein (that is involved in the regulation of UV
related damage repair) were acquired by LGT from eukaryotes [58]. D. radiodurans has also acquired the genes
belonging to the late embryogenesis abundant (lea) family from plants [58]. These genes give resistance against
dessication in plants and might provide D. radiodurans
with additional resistance to UV radiation, since there is a
positive correlation between resistance to dessication and
radioresistance [58].

A comparative genomic analysis of the peizophilic strains
of Photobacterium profundum has identified that several
genes that are common to all the strains and responsible
for high pressure adaptation are probably laterally
acquired. Some of these genes are upregulated under high
pressure conditions possibly suggesting their involvement
in high pressure adaptation of P. profundum [30]. The
genome sequence of Colwellia psychrerythraea has revealed
that the psychrophilic lifestyle of this organism is due to
the acquisition of a few genes by LGT in addition to
amino acid content variations. Though LGT was not a primary player in the adaptation of this organism to this lifestyle, some specific lateral acquisitions including some of
the cold shock proteins (possibly acquired from Vibrio sp.

and Shewanella onediensis) and proteins responsible for
the synthesis and degradation of complex high molecular
weight organic compounds (acquired from Ralstonia
eutropha) are certainly adaptive [31].
The genome sequence of Halobacterium indicates that
most of the components of the electron transport chain
including NADH dehydrogenase (nuo), menaquinone
(men) and cytochrome oxidase (cox) are similar to the corresponding genes in E.coli and D.radiodurans. This suggests the transfer of genes involved in aerobic respiration
from eubacteria into Halobacterium by LGT [59]. Another
thermophilic archaea, Picrophilus torridus has acquired the
genes that have the ability to degrade the organic acids
such as acetic and propionic acid, superoxide dismutase,
peroxiredoxin and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase to cope
with oxidative stress along with the genes that encode the
main components of the electron transport chain [60].
In contrast to pathogenic adaptations, these adaptations
have largely been acquired by the LGT of a single gene.
The above examples spanning different bacterial genomes
clearly emphasize the adaptive role of LGTs. However, the
examples discussed above are only the success stories of
laterally acquired genes. Not all of the laterally acquired
genes are adaptive. Of the many genes that are acquired,
only a few genes that are adaptive are retained and fixed
in a population [61]. There have been some studies suggesting that most of the laterally transferred genes are not
useful and are hence reduced to pseudogenes [62] and
studies that indicated the inability of LGTs to translate
into functional proteins [63]. Given the examples above
emphasizing the adaptive role of LGTs and counter-examples that suggest that most of the LGTs are not adaptive, it
is important to explore the adaptive nature of LGTs and
how frequently they are adaptive, if at all.

Results
To answer the question on the adaptive role of LGTs, we
have employed a maximum likelihood method to infer
gene insertion/deletion rates at various stages during the
evolution of five sequenced Corynebacterium genomes and
have performed a systematic study on the species specific
genes to further understand the role of the laterally
acquired genes.
Insertion and deletion rates
Gene insertions and deletions in closely related genomes
can be inferred by looking at the phyletic patterns of gene
presence or absence on a phylogenetic tree. Maximum
parsimony and maximum likelihood methods have been
successfully employed to understand the gene insertions/
deletions [18,64-70]. The maximum likelihood analysis
[70] was performed using the phylogeny derived from a
concatenated DNA sequence of the em fusA, gltS, infB,

lysS, rplB, rpoB, secY, serS and em ychF genes (Figure 1)
and assuming that individual insertion and deletion
events occur independently. The insertion/deletion rate of
1.18 (LnL = -10875.4) was obtained using a model which
assumes a single constant insertion/deletion rate (μ) on
all branches (Model I). Branch lengths are measured relative to the estimated number of base substitutions, suggesting that there is one gene gained/lost for every
nucleotide substitution. This rate is higher than that
obtained from the study on Bacillus (0.51) [70], and close
to that of Streptococcus (1.17) [71]. A second model,
Model II, that assumes different insertion/deletion rates
on external and internal branches (Figure 1) resulted in a
higher rate (1.26) on external branches compared to the
internal branches (1.06; Table 1) indicating that gene
movement is greater on the external branches. The
improvement in the likelihood although small is significant (χ2 = Δ2 LnL > 3.84 with d.f. = 1). A non-hierarchical
model, assuming an irreversible gene loss, also shows a
similar trend of a higher rate on external branches (1.33)
over that on internal branches (0.60) (Table 1). The likelihood surface and the curvature of the likelihood surface
are given as supplementary data (See Additional Files 9,
14 and 15).

that are specifically retained by a single species or cases of
intra-group gene transfers. LGTs reported here do not
include the ORFan genes (as defined by [72]; genes with
no hits to the NCBI nr database) of these species. As a
result, the number of LGTs presented here will be a large
under estimate of the actual number of LGTs in each of
these species. The list of LGTs and their putative function
along with the entire list of species specific genes can be
found at [73].

A third model (Model III) considered a separate rate on
each branch and also indicated that the external branches
have an enhanced apparent insertion/deletion rate and
that the rate of change varies greatly (Table 2). The large
change in the likelihood from Model II to Model III with
a small change in the number of parameters suggests that
the fit of the model is significantly better. Interestingly,
the rates on the external branches (μ3, μ4) leading to the
two strains of C. glutamicum were higher compared to the
other external branches. This is probably due to the larger
genome size of C. glutamicum and smaller branch
lengths. It is not due to the smaller number of genes differentiating these taxa since if these numbers of genes are
halved, the rates remain comparable. Similarly, increased
insertion/deletion rates on the branches leading to C.
glutamicum strains (μ6) and C. glutamicum and C. efficiens (μ7) could be due to the fact that these represent the
branches leading to species having larger genome sizes.

A comparison with three other corynebacterial genomes
revealed the presence of 659 genes that are uniquely
present in C. glutamicum species. These are the genes that
are present in both the strains of C. glutamicum and absent
in other corynebacterial species. This does not include the
set of genes that are unique to a single strain of C. glutamicum. Of the 659 genes, 74 were acquired by LGT, 206 were
identified as MDLT due to their presence in other actinobacterial taxa. There were 377 genes present only in the
two strains of C. glutamicum and did not have hits in
NCBI. Many (346/659) of the species specific genes
encode hypothetical proteins. Unlike the other corynebacterial species, C. glutamicum has 58 membrane proteins, 16 regulatory proteins and 15 ABC transport related
proteins (as classified in the annotation) indicating a
greater metabolic diversity compared to the other species.

Species specific genes
Species specific genes were divided into two categories
based on BLAST and phylogenetic clustering; (1) Lateral
gene transfers and (2) possible multiple deletion or lateral
transfers (MDLT) (Table 3). The unique genes that cluster
with BLAST homologues (at an E-value cutoff of 1.0 × 1010) outside actinobacteria were considered as possible
LGTs. Genes that were uniquely present in a Corynebacterium species but cluster with BLAST homologues from
taxa within actinobacteria were considered as MDLT. The
MDLT may possibly be instances of multiple deletions

The present study identified 215 genes specific to the C.
diphtheriae genome. Of the 215 genes, 48 were possibly
acquired by lateral gene transfer whereas the remaining
167 are MDLT. The functions of most of these genes are
unknown (81 out of 215 encode hypothetical proteins),
however, a comparison of the results with earlier studies
on C. diphtheriae [74] indicate that many of these genes
might encode proteins that are responsible for virulence
related traits.
The study identified 283 C. efficiens specific genes, 225 are
designated as MDLT while the remaining 58 are possibly
acquired by LGT. A majority (194/283) of the species specific genes encode hypothetical proteins.

The study revealed the presence of 323 genes that are specific to C. jeikeium. Of the 323 genes, 292 are MDLT
whereas the remaining 31 genes were possibly acquired by
LGT. Again, a majority (179 of 323) of the species specific
genes encode hypothetical proteins, however, some of the
genes whose function is identified revealed that these
genes were involved in the uptake of iron and manganese
and hence might have a role in virulence and pathogenesis.

substitution rate (Ka) and their ratio (Ka/Ks) was measured

for the orthologous genes between C. glutamicum and C.
efficiens. The genes were divided into four groups based on
the evolutionary time scale : genes present in C. glutamicum and C. efficiens only, genes present in C. glutamicum,
C. effciens and C. diphtheriae only, genes present in all
Corynebacterium species and absent in the outgroup and
genes present in all the Corynebacterium species along with
the outgroup. The genes present only in C. glutamicum and
C. efficiens represent the putative most recently acquired

genes while the genes present in all the species including
the outgroup represent the most ancient genes. The results
indicate that the genes that are inferred to have arisen
recently via LGT in the phylogeny have more non-synonymous substitution changes than those that were transferred somewhat more anciently (Figure 2A versus 2B is P
< 0.01 in a Wilcoxon rank test). As genes are resident in
the species for longer periods the non-synonymous
changes continue to go down (Figure 2B versus 2C is P <

0.01, Figure 2C versus 2D is P < 0.01). A similar trend was
observed for Ks and Ka/Ks where recently acquired genes
had a higher rate of Ks (Figure 3) and Ka/Ks (Figure 4) compared to the genes that have been resident longer. The
analysis was repeated removing all the genes that did not
have any homologs in non-Corynebacterium genomes,
assuming that the genes present only in C. glutamicum and
C. efficiens, and have no hits in the NCBI nr database are
potential annotation artefacts. The distribution of Ka, Ks,
and Ka/Ks values remains remarkably similar even after
removing the uniquely present ORFs (see Additional Files
10, 11, 12) confirming the robustness of the result that
recently acquired genes have higher rates of Ka, Ks, as well
as a higher Ka/Ks ratio.

confirmed the enhanced rate of insertions/deletions on
the external branches clearly showing a decrease in the
rate with an increase in phylogenetic depth. The enhanced
rate on the external branches of the phylogeny might indicate the transient nature of many of the laterally acquired
genes. However, the observed difference between the rates
on external and internal branches is not as dramatic as
reported for the Bacillus group [70]. This may be due to the
different phylogenetic relationship between the studies. If
the transient nature of the LGTs holds true, one should
expect lower rates of insertions/deletions on long external
branches compared to short external branches. In fact, the
rate of ins/del on short external branches in the Bacillus
cereus group [70] is higher than the rate on external
branches in this study. Furthermore, the rate estimation of
insertion/deletion is robust for different cutoffs used for
determining gene homologues. Different cutoffs (expect
value <10-20 with match length > 85%, expect value <10-10
with match length > 70%, and expect value <10-5 with
match length > 50%) show the similar trend that external
branches tend to have higher rates of insertions/deletions
than internal branches (see Additional Files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7).

Discussion
A maximum likelihood estimation of the gene insertion/
deletion rate assuming a constant rate on all the branches
was 1.18. This is higher than the inferred base substitution
rates on the branches indicating that gene insertion/deletion plays a significant role in the evolution of these
genomes. Genome rearrangement has been shown to
have a minor role in the evolution of corynebacterial
genomes [75] indicating that gene gain/loss might have a
greater role in the evolution of Corynebacterium species. A
model considering independent rates on each branch

In this study, the maximum likelihood estimation is

ity. In the study, all insertions/deletions were assumed to
be independent and the rate of insertion/deletion was
estimated from the gene phyletic pattern. Because of the
difficulty of inferring insertion/deletion events after many
genome rearrangements, the number of gene insertions/
deletions rather than the actually insertion/deletion
events was used in the maximum likelihood estimation.
To overcome the simplistic assumptions in this study,
more practical parameters, such as block ins/del rates, can
be added to make the model more realistic in future studies.
The comparison of the synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka) substitution rates of the genes that entered at
various levels of the phylogeny indicate that the recently
acquired genes evolve faster and have a higher proportion
of synonymous as well as non-synonymous substitutions
compared to their older counterparts (Figures 2,3). These
results agree with earlier results indicating faster evolution

of the recently acquired genes [70-72]. One of the possible
reasons for faster rates of evolution could be that the
newly acquired genes are required in the new habitat and
are evolving faster to adapt to their new roles/habitat.
Alternatively, some of these genes could be under relaxed
functional constraint as they are non-functional in the
new environment and might be evolving faster until they
are deleted [70]. A more recent study has demostrated that
low GC content causes seletive silencing of foreign DNA
[76]. It was found that recently acquired genes tend to
have lower GC content compared with ancient ones (see
Additional File 16). This also supports the elevated evolutionary rates of recently acquired genes.
In this study, the phyletic patterns were derived primarily
from genome annotation. As described previously in [70],
non-annotated genes were picked up via a TBLASTN
search and genes that are uniquely present in only one
studied genome were removed from the study. Further-

more, a comparison was made by removing the ORFs only
present in C. glutamicum and C. efficiens but not present in
any other complete bacterial genomes (see Additional
Files 10, 11, 12). The rates do not change remarkably after
removing the Cgl-Cef group unique genes. This suggests
that the fast rate of evolution of recently acquired genes is
not an artifact of fast evolving non-gene ORFs in C.
glutamicum and C. efficiens. A comparison of the corynebacterial genomes revealed that about 9 – 21% of the
genes are specific to each species indicating that gene gain/
gene loss has a major contribution in the evolution of
these genomes. The results indicate that more than 10 –
35% of the species specific genes have been acquired by
lateral gene transfer while the remaining are identified as
possible MDLT (as inferred by their presence in other
actinobacterial genomes).

The LGTs broadly fall into two categories; functionally
characterised genes and hypothetical proteins. The analysis of the functionally characterised genes reveals that the
pathogenic species C. diphtheriae and C. jeikeium have
recruited genes that help in survival, host attachment and
virulence. C. diphtheriae has acquired the genes responsible for iron transport [77,78] and siderophore biosynthesis that are directly involved in virulence. The acquisition
of the genes encoding fimbrial subunits might indicate an
adaptive mechanism whereby it helps in the attachment
to the host cell surface [79], whereas the acquisition of the
lantibiotic biosynthesis genes might help it to defend
itself from other bacteria [80]. C. jeikeium has acquired
genes that help in iron uptake. In addition, it has also
acquired the genes necessary for uptake of manganese,
another important requirement in pathogenesis [81]. The
acquisition of the gene cbpA encoding a collagen binding
protein might help in the bacterium-host interaction [82],

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7(Suppl 1):S8

whereas the presence of the genes surA and surB, encoding
surface proteins, and the gene acpA, encoding an alkaline
phosphatase, might help in virulence [83]. The acquisition of the neuraminidase encoding gene suggests that
this might help C. jeikeium to prevent competition by
other bacteria [84].
Unlike pathogenic species, the non-pathogenic species
appear to have recruited many genes that are directly or
indirectly involved in metabolic processes. C. glutamicum
has acquired large numbers (53) of genes encoding membrane related proteins compared to the other species.
Nishio et al [85] have indicated that many of the genes
involved in amino acid biosynthesis are vertically inherited by C. glutamicum and only a few are acquired by lateral gene transfer. Our analysis identified only three genes
(brnE, mdh2, scrB) that have been found to have a role in
amino acid and vitamin biosynthesis [86]. The analysis of
the LGTs in C. efficiens did not give many clues of their
function as most of these genes encode hypothetical proteins.
We haven't considered in our study the ORFan genes [72]
that account for about 10% of the genes in each of these
species. Most of the recent studies on ORFans have confirmed that they are not a result of annotation errors but
are in fact true genes, most of them being a part of
genomic islands indicating their acquisition by LGT
[23,72,87-89]. Given some of the examples reviewed here
and based on the results obtained from this study on
Corynebacterium species, it is compelling to suggest that at
least some of these laterally acquired genes might have a
role directly or indirectly in the adaptation of corynebacterial species.

Conclusion
We demonstrate that 13 – 20% of the protein coding
genes are specific to each Corynebacterium species and that
these species have evolved mostly by LGT and gene loss.
Maximum likelihood analysis indicates that there are
more lateral transfers inferred at the tips of the phylogeny
and that most of the lateral gene transfers are transient.
Recently acquired genes evolve faster compared to their
native counterparts. The faster rate of evolution of these
recently acquired genes might reflect adaptation to new
niches or might reflect rapid gene decay.

Methods
Genome sequences used
Five Corynebacterium genome sequences were obtained
from NCBI [90] to carry out the analysis. They are C.
jeikeium (Cje; [91]), C. diphtheriae (Cdi; [74]), C. glutamicum (NCBI accession No. NC_003450, Cgl1; [92]), C.
glutamicum (NCBI accession No. NC_006958, Cgl2; [86])

and C. efficiens (Cef; [93]). Mycobacterium bovis (Mbo;
[94]) was used as the outgroup.
Maximum likelihood analysis
The evolutionary history of the Corynebacterium taxa was
generated from the concatenated DNA sequences of fusA,
gltS, infB, lysS, rplB, rpoB, secY, serS and ychF genes using
Mr.Bayes ([95]; 200,000 generations sampled every 100
generations with a gamma distribution model and invariant class). The method to identify members of a gene family has been described in [66]. In brief, potential
homologues were measured according to sequence similarities, and all paralogues in each genome were clustered
as a single gene family and only one member was used for
further analysis. The phyletic patterns (gene presence or
absence in each genome) of all genes were used for the
maximum likelihood analysis (see Additional File 1). The
method to estimate likelihood has been described in [70].
Three different models, model I, II and III were used.
Model I assumed a constant insertion/deletion rate on all
the branches. In model II, the branches were separated
into external and internal branches and rates were calculated separately for internal and external branches. In
Model III the rates were calculated assuming each individual branch separately.
Identification of species specific genes
The protein sequences from all the genomes were compared to each other using BLASTP [96], with an E-value
cutoff set at 1.0 × 10-20 and an additional criteria of match
length set at 85% of the query sequence. A set of genes
present uniquely in a species and absent in the outgroup
were considered as specific to that species. The species specific genes were checked to ensure that they are not simply
a result of annotation errors. In the case of C. glutamicum
with two intraspecific strains, all the genes that are present
in both the strains and absent in other genomes including
the outgroup were considered species specific. The genes
present uniquely in a single strain were not considered.
The species specific genes identified are sensitive to the
parameters used in any study and to the number of taxa
sampled.
Lateral gene transfer
The unique proteins of each species were compared to the
NCBI nr database using BLASTP and with the expect value
cutoff set at 1.0 × 10-10 to identify homologs in other
organisms. For each protein, the first 50 hits with an
expect value less than 1.0 × 10-10 were chosen for further
analysis regarding possible lateral gene transfers. The
complete protein sequences of these 50 hits were extracted
from the GenBank database and a multiple alignment was
done using ClustalW [97]. The multiple alignment was
used to generate a phylogenetic tree using the neighbor
joining (NJ) method [98] as implemented in PHYLIP

[69]. The genes identified as LGTs by NJ trees were further
confirmed by reconstructing phylogenetic trees using
PROML (JTT + invariable class + γ distribution model)
with rate paratmeter α calculated by Tree Puzzle [99].
Synonymous/non-synonymous substitution rate
Synonymous changes and non-synonymous changes
were measured by the PAML package [100]. The tree
length of synonymous changes was calculated as the sum
of the branch lengths for the taxa only within Cgl and Cef
using the maximum likelihood method from the PAML
package. Genes were categorised into four groups based
on their presence/absence in different taxa (and hence on
the inferred time period when the genes were transferred).
The four groups are characterised by genes present in Cgl
and Cef; genes present in Cgl, Cef, and Cdi; genes present
in Cgl, Cef, Cdi, and Cje; and genes present in Mbo and
all Corynebacterium taxa. Single copy protein sequences
and their corresponding DNA sequences were extracted
from the annotated genomes. Protein sequences were
aligned using ClustalW [97], and nucleotide sequence
alignments were created from the protein alignments by
replacing each amino acid with its corresponding codon.
