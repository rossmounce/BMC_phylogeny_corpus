information

Conclusions: Despite the unmistakable organizational similarities between the B. licheniformis and
B. subtilis genomes, there are notable differences in the numbers and locations of prophages,
transposable elements and a number of extracellular enzymes and secondary metabolic pathway
operons that distinguish these species. Differences include a region of more than 80 kilobases (kb)
that comprises a cluster of polyketide synthase genes and a second operon of 38 kb encoding
plipastatin synthase enzymes that are absent in the B. licheniformis genome. The availability of a
completed genome sequence for B. licheniformis should facilitate the design and construction of
improved industrial strains and allow for comparative genomics and evolutionary studies within this
group of Bacillaceae.

Results: We determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the B. licheniformis ATCC 14580
genome which comprises a circular chromosome of 4,222,336 base-pairs (bp) containing 4,208
predicted protein-coding genes with an average size of 873 bp, seven rRNA operons, and 72 tRNA
genes. The B. licheniformis chromosome contains large regions that are colinear with the genomes
of B. subtilis and Bacillus halodurans, and approximately 80% of the predicted B. licheniformis coding
sequences have B. subtilis orthologs.

Background: Bacillus licheniformis is a Gram-positive, spore-forming soil bacterium that is used in
the biotechnology industry to manufacture enzymes, antibiotics, biochemicals and consumer
products. This species is closely related to the well studied model organism Bacillus subtilis, and
produces an assortment of extracellular enzymes that may contribute to nutrient cycling in nature.

Background

Bacillus licheniformis is a Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium widely distributed as a saprophytic organism in the
environment. This species is a close relative of Bacillus subtilis, an organism that is second only to Escherichia coli in the
level of detail at which it has been studied. Unlike most other
bacilli, which are predominantly aerobic, B. licheniformis is a
facultative anaerobe, which may allow it to grow in additional
ecological niches. Certain B. licheniformis isolates are capable of denitrification; the relevance of this characteristic to
environmental denitrification may be small, however, as the
species generally persists in soil as endospores [1].
There are numerous commercial and agricultural uses for B.
licheniformis and its extracellular products. The species has
been used for decades in the manufacture of industrial
enzymes including several proteases, α-amylase, penicillinase, pentosanase, cycloglucosyltransferase, β-mannanase
and several pectinolytic enzymes. The proteases from B.
licheniformis are used in the detergent industry as well as for
dehairing and bating of leather [2,3]. Amylases from B.
licheniformis are deployed for the hydrolysis of starch, desizing of textiles and sizing of paper [3]. Specific B. licheniformis
strains are also used to produce peptide antibiotics such as
bacitracin and proticin in addition to a number of specialty
chemicals such as citric acid, inosine, inosinic acid and polyγ-glutamic acid [4]. Some B. licheniformis isolates can mitigate the affects of fungal pathogens on maize, grasses and
vegetable crops [5]. As an endospore-forming bacterium, the
ability of the organism to survive under unfavorable environmental conditions may enhance its potential as a natural biocontrol agent.
B. licheniformis can be differentiated from other bacilli on the
basis of metabolic and physiological tests [6,7]; however, biochemical and phenotypic characteristics may be ambiguous
among closely related species. Recent taxonomic studies indicate that B. licheniformis is closely related to B. subtilis and
Bacillus amyloliquefaciens on the basis of comparisons of
16S rDNA and 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer (ITS)
nucleotide sequences [8]. Lapidus et al. [9] recently constructed a physical map of the B. licheniformis chromosome
using a PCR approach, and established a number of regions of
colinearity where gene content and organization were conserved with the B. subtilis genome.
Given that B. licheniformis is an industrial organism used for
the manufacture of enzymes, antibiotics, and chemicals,
important in nutrient cycling in the environment, and a species that is taxonomically related to B. subtilis, perhaps the
best studied of all Gram-positive bacteria, we derived the
complete nucleotide sequence of the B. licheniformis type
strain (ATCC 14580) genome. With this data in hand, functional and comparative genomics studies can be initiated that
may ultimately lead to new strategies for improving industrial

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/10/R77

strains as well as better understanding of genome evolution
among the species within the subtilis-licheniformis group.

Results and discussion
General features of the B. licheniformis genome
The genome of B. licheniformis ATCC 14580 consists of a circular chromosome of 4,222,336 base-pairs (bp) with an average G+C content of 46.2% (Table 1). No plasmids were found
during the genome analysis, and none were found by agarose
gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Using a combination of
several gene-finding programs and manual inspection, 4,208
protein-coding sequences (CDSs) were predicted. These
CDSs constitute 87% of the genome and have an average
length of 873 bp (ranging from 78 to 10,767 bp). They are oriented on the chromosome primarily in the direction of replication (Figure 1) with 74.4% of the genes on the leading
strand and 25.6% on the lagging strand. Among the 4,208
protein coding genes, 3,948 (94%) had significant similarity
to proteins in PIR, 3,187 (76%) of these gene models contain
Interpro motifs, and 2,895 (69%) contain protein motifs
found in PFAM. The number of hypothetical and conserved
hypothetical proteins in the B. licheniformis genome with hits
in the PIR database was 1,318 (212 conserved hypothetical
proteins). Among the list of hypothetical and conserved hypothetical gene products, 683 (52%) have protein motifs contained in PFAM (148 conserved hypothetical proteins). There
are 72 tRNA genes representing all 20 amino acids and seven
rRNA operons.
The likely origin of replication (Figure 1) was identified by
similarities to several features of the corresponding regions in
B. subtilis and other bacteria. These included co-localization
of four genes (rpmH, dnaA, dnaN, and recF) near the origin,
GC nucleotide skew ((G-C)/(G+C)) analysis, and the presence
of multiple dnaA-boxes and AT-rich sequences immediately
upstream of the dnaA gene [10-12]. On the basis of these
observations we assigned a cytosine residue of the BstBI
restriction site between the rpmH and dnaA genes to be the
first nucleotide of the B. licheniformis genome. The replication termination site was localized near 2.02 megabases (Mb)
by GC skew analysis. This region lies roughly opposite the origin of replication (Figure 1). Unlike B. subtilis, there was no
apparent gene encoding a replication terminator protein (rtp)
in B. licheniformis. The Bacillus halodurans genome also
lacks an obvious rtp function [13]; therefore, it seems likely
that B. subtilis acquired the rtp gene following its divergence
from B. halodurans and B. licheniformis.

Transposable elements, prophages and atypical
regions
The genome of B. licheniformis ATCC 14580 contains nine
identical copies of a 1,285 bp insertion sequence element
termed IS3Bli1 [9]. This sequence shares a number of features with other IS3 family elements [9] including direct
repeats of 3-5 bp, a 10-bp left inverted repeat, and a 9 bp right

Extracellular enzymes and metabolic activities
In the Bacillus licheniformis genome, 689 of the 4,208 gene
models have signal peptides forecast by SignalP [20]. Of
these, 309 have no transmembrane domain predicted by
TMHMM [21] and 134 are hypothetical or conserved
hypothetical genes. Based on a manual examination of the
remaining 175 genes, at least 82 are likely to encode secreted
proteins and enzymes. Moreover, there are 27 predicted
extracellular proteins encoded by the B. licheniformis ATCC
14580 genome that are not found in B. subtilis 168. In accord-

information

The presence of several bacteriophage lysogens or prophagelike elements was revealed by Smith-Waterman comparisons
to other bacterial genomes and by their AT-rich signatures
(Figure 3, Table 2). Prophage sequences, designated NZP1
and NZP3 (similar to B. subtilis prophages PBSX and φ-105),
were discovered by noting the presence of nearby genes that
code for the large subunit of terminase, a signature protein
that is highly conserved among prophages [19]. Interestingly,
a terminase gene was not observed in the third putative
prophage, termed NZP2 (similarity to B. subtilis phage SPP1);
however, its absence may be the result of genome deterioration during evolution. Interestingly, we observed that regions
in which the G+C content is less than 39% usually encoded
proteins that have no B. subtilis ortholog and share identity
only with hypothetical and conserved hypothetical genes.
Two of these AT-rich segments correspond to the NZP2 and
NZP3 prophages.

An isochore plot (Figure 3) also revealed the presence of a
region with an atypically high (62%) G+C content. This segment contains two hypothetical genes whose sizes (3,831 and
2,865 bp) greatly exceed the size of an average CDS in B.
licheniformis. The first gene encodes a protein of 1,277 amino
acids for which Interpro predicts 16 collagen triple-helix
repeats, and the amino acid pattern TGATGPT is repeated 75
times within the polypeptide. The second CDS is smaller, and
encodes a protein with 11 collagen triple-helix repeats; the
same TGATGPT motif recurs 56 times. The primary translation products from these genes do not contain canonical signal peptides for secretion, and they do not contain motifs for
the twin-arginine or sortase-mediated translocation pathways. Therefore, it is not likely that they are exported to the
cell surface or the extracellular medium. Interestingly, the
chromosomal region (19 kb) adjacent to these genes is clearly
non-colinear with the B. subtilis genome, and virtually all of
the predicted genes encode hypothetical or conserved hypothetical proteins. There are a number of bacterial proteins
listed in PIR that also contain collagen triple-helix repeat
regions, including two from Mesorhizobium loti (accession
numbers NF00607049 and NF00607035) and three from B.
cereus (accession numbers NF01692528, NF01269899 and
NF01694666). These putative orthologs share 53-76%
amino-acid sequence identity with their counterparts in B.
licheniformis, and their functions are unknown.

inverted repeat (Figure 2). IS3Bli1 encodes two predicted
overlapping CDSs, designated orfA and orfB in relative translational reading frames of 0 and -1. The presence of a 'slippery
heptamer' motif, AAAAAAG, before the stop codon in orfA
may indicate that programmed translational frameshifting
occurs between these two coding sequences, resulting in a
single gene product [14]. The orfB gene product harbors the
DD(35)E(7)K motif, a highly conserved pattern among insertion sequences. Eight of these IS3Bli1 elements lie in intergenic regions, and one interrupts the comP gene as noted
previously [9]. In addition to these insertion sequences, the
genome encodes a putative transposase that is most closely
related (E = 1.8 × 10-11) to one identified in the Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis genome [15]; however, similar
transposase genes are also found in the chromosomes of B.
halodurans [13], Oceanobacillus iheyensis [16], Streptococcus agalactiae [17] and Streptococcus pyogenes [18].

ance with its saprophytic lifestyle, the secretome of B. licheniformis encodes numerous secreted enzymes that hydrolyze
polysaccharides, proteins, lipids and other nutrients.
Cellulose is the most abundant polysaccharide on Earth, and
microorganisms that hydrolyze cellulose contribute to the
global carbon cycle. Interestingly, two gene clusters involved
in cellulose degradation and utilization were discovered in B.
licheniformis, and there are no counterparts in B. subtilis
168. The enzymes encoded by the first gene cluster include
two putative endoglucanases belonging to glycoside hydrolase families GH9 and GH5, a probable cellulose-1,4-β-cellobiosidase of family GH48, and a putative β-mannanase of
family GH5. The β-mannanase (GH5) and endoglucanase
(GH9) both harbor carbohydrate-binding motifs. With the
exception of the cellulose-1,4-β-cellobiosidase (GH48), all of
the gene products encoded in this cluster have secretory signal peptides, and all have homologs in Bacillus species other
than B. subtilis. The overall G+C content of this cluster (48%)
does not appear to differ appreciably from that of the genome
average (46%). The second gene cluster encodes a putative βglucosidase (GH1) and three components of a cellobiose-specific PTS transport complex. A second β-glucosidase (GH3)
gene is present at an unlinked locus in the genome. Collectively, the genes in these two clusters should enable
B. licheniformis to utilize cellulose as a carbon and energy

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/10/R77

source, converting it to cellobiose and ultimately glucose. In
this regard, we have confirmed that B. licheniformis ATCC
14580 is capable of growth on carboxymethyl cellulose as a
sole carbon source (not shown). The chromosome of B.
licheniformis ATCC 14580 encodes a number of additional
carbohydrase activities that may allow the organism to grow
on a broad range of polysaccharides. These include xylanase,
endo-arabinase and pectate lyase that may be involved in degradation of hemicellulose, α-amylase and α-glucosidase for
starch hydrolysis, chitinases for the breakdown of chitooligosaccharides from fungi and insects, and levanase for utilization of β-D-fructans (levans). Several of these activities are
marketed as industrial enzymes.
Saprophytic organisms must utilize a variety of nitrogenous
compounds as nutrients for growth and metabolism. On the
basis of the information encoded in its genome, B. licheniformis ATCC 14580 possesses the ability to acquire nitrogen
from exogenous proteins, peptides, amino acids, ammonia,
nitrate and nitrite. Like B. subtilis, the repertoire of extracellular proteases produced by B. licheniformis includes serine
proteases (aprE, epr, vpr), metalloprotease (mpr), and an
assortment of endo- and exopeptidases (yjbG, ydiC, gcp,
ykvY, ampS, bpr (two copies), yfxM, yuiE, yusX, ywaD,
pepT). However, B. licheniformis also has the capacity to produce a number of additional proteases and peptidases that
are not encoded in the B. subtilis genome. These include a
clostripain-like protease, a zinc-metallopeptidase, a probable
glutamyl endopeptidase, an aminopeptidase C homolog, two
putative dipeptidases and a zinc-carboxypeptidase.
B. licheniformis also has the ability to utilize amino and imino
nitrogen from arginine, asparagine and glutamine via
arginine deiminase, arginase, asparaginase and glutaminase
activities. Interestingly, there appear to be two genes each for
arginase, asparaginase and glutaminase. Presumably, the
arginine deiminase activity is expressed during anaerobic
growth on arginine, whereas the arginase activities are predominant during aerobic growth. The occurrence of putative
arginase genes is somewhat of an enigma in B. licheniformis,
because there are no genes encoding urease activity for the
hydrolysis of urea that is generated by the arginase reaction.
In addition to the absence of urease gene homologs (ureABC)
in B. licheniformis, the glutamine ABC transporters (glnH,
glnM, glnP, glnQ gene products) are also lacking.
It appears that nitrogen assimilation and transport pathways
may be coordinated similarly in B. licheniformis and B. subtilis owing to the presence of key genes such as glnA, glnR,
tnrA and nrgA in both species. Likewise, the pathways for
nitrate/nitrite transport and metabolism in B. licheniformis
appear to be analogous to the corresponding pathways in B.
subtilis as suggested by the presence of nasABC (nitrate
transport), narGHIJ (respiratory nitrate reductase), and nasDEF (NADH-dependent nitrite reductase) genes. Unlike B.
subtilis, B. licheniformis evidently possesses the capability

for anaerobic respiration using nitric oxide reductase. Moreover, the gene encoding this activity lies in a cluster that
includes CDSs for narK (nitrite extrusion protein), two putative fnr proteins (transcriptional regulators of anaerobic
growth), and a dnrN-like gene product (nitric oxide-dependent regulator). These observations are consistent with previous findings that certain B. licheniformis isolates are capable
of denitrification [22]. While denitrification is a process of
major ecological importance, the contribution of B. licheniformis may be small as the species exists predominantly as
endospores in soil [1].
Microbial D-hydantoinase enzymes have been applied to the
industrial production of optically pure D-amino acids for
synthesis of antibiotics, pesticides, sweeteners and therapeutic amino acids [23]. This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of
cyclic ureides such as dihydropyrimidines and 5-monosubstituted hydantoins to N-carbamoyl amino acids. Hydantoinase
activities have been detected in a variety of bacterial genera,

and a cluster of six genes in B. licheniformis appears to confer
a similar capability. This gene cluster encodes N-methylhydantoinase (ATP-hydrolyzing), hydantoin utilization proteins
A and B (hyuAB homologs), a possible transcriptional
regulator (TetR/AcrR family), a putative pyrimidine
permease, and a hypothetical protein that contains an Interpro domain (IPR004399) for phosphomethylpyrimidine
kinase.

Protein export, sporulation and competence pathways
Kunst et al. [10] listed 18 genes that have a major role in the
secretion of extracellular enzymes by the classical (Sec) pathway in B. subtilis 168. This list includes several chaperonins,
signal peptidases, components of the signal recognition particle and protein translocase complexes. All members of this
list have B. licheniformis counterparts. In addition to the Sec
pathway, some B. subtilis proteins are directed into the twinarginine (Tat) export pathway, possibly in a Sec-independent
manner. Curiously, the B. licheniformis genome encodes

Like B. subtilis 168, the B. licheniformis ATCC 14580 chromosome harbors a siderophore biosynthesis gene cluster
(dhbABCEF), and the organization of the cluster is similar to
the corresponding chromosomal segment in B. subtilis. In
addition, the B. licheniformis genome contains a second gene

Unexpectedly, a cluster of 11 genes was found encoding a lantibiotic, with its associated modification and transport functions. We designated this peptide of 75 amino acids as
lichenicidin, and its closest homolog is mersacidin from
Bacillus sp. strain HIL-Y85/54728 [30]. Lantibiotics are
ribosomally synthesized peptides that are modified posttranslationally so that the final molecules contain rare
thioether amino acids such as lanthionine and/or methyl-lanthionine [31]. Like mersacidin, lichenicidin appears to be a
type B lantibiotic, comprising a rigid globular peptide with no
net charge (7 acidic residues, 7 basic residues) and a leader
peptide with a conserved double glycine cleavage site (GGtype leader peptide). These antimicrobial compounds have
attracted much attention in recent years as models for the
design and genetic engineering of improved antimicrobial
agents [32]. However, since several post-translational modifications and product-specific export functions are required,
a dedicated expression system is a prerequisite to provide all
the factors necessary to synthesize, modify and transport the
lantibiotic peptide. With its history of use in industrial microbiology, B. licheniformis may be an attractive candidate for
the development of such an expression system.

deposited research

Bacitracin is a cyclic peptide antibiotic that is synthesized
non-ribosomally by some B. licheniformis isolates [26].
While there is variation in the prevalence of bacitracin synthase genes among laboratory strains of this species, one
study suggested that up to 50% may harbor the bac operon
[27]. Interestingly, the bac operon is not present in the type
strain (ATCC 14580) genome. Seemingly, the only non-ribosomal peptide synthase operon encoded by the B. licheniformis type strain genome is that responsible for lichenysin
biosynthesis. Lichenysin structurally resembles surfactin
from B. subtilis [28], and their respective biosynthetic operons are highly similar. Surprisingly, we found no B. licheniformis counterparts for the pps (plipastatin synthase) and
polyketide synthase (pks) operons of B. subtilis. Collectively,
these two regions represent sizeable portions (80 kb and 38
kb, respectively) of the chromosome in B. subtilis, although
they are reportedly dispensable [29].

reports

Natural competence (the ability to take up and process exogenous DNA in specific growth conditions) is a feature of few
B. licheniformis strains [24]. The reasons for variability in
competence phenotype have not been explored at the genetic
level, but the genome data offer several possible explanations.
Although the B. licheniformis genome encodes all of the late
competence functions ascribed in B. subtilis (for example,
comC, comEFG operons, comK, mecA), it lacks an obvious
comS gene, and the comP gene is punctuated by an insertion
sequence element (IS3Bli1), suggesting that the early stages
of competence development have been pre-empted in B.
licheniformis ATCC 14580. Whether these early functions can
be restored by introducing the corresponding genes from B.
subtilis is unknown. In addition to an apparent deficiency in
DNA uptake, two type I restriction-modification systems
were discovered that may also contribute to diminished
transformation efficiencies. These are distinct from the
ydiOPS genes of B. subtilis, and could participate in degradation of improperly modified DNA from heterologous hosts
used during construction of recombinant expression vectors.
Each of these loci in B. licheniformis (designated as BliI and
BliII) encode putative HsdS, HsdM and HsdR subunits that
share significant amino-acid sequence identity to type I
restriction-modification proteins in other bacteria. Curiously,
the G+C-content for these loci (37%) is substantially lower
than the overall genome average (46%) which may hint that
they are the result of gene acquisitions. Lastly, the synthesis
of a glutamyl polypeptide capsule has also been implicated as
a potential barrier to transformation of B. licheniformis
strains [25]. While laboratory strains of B. subtilis usually do

not produce significant capsular material, the genome
sequence of B. subtilis 168 indicates that they may harbor the
genes required for synthesis of polyglutamic acid. In contrast,
many B. licheniformis isolates produce copious amounts of
capsular material, giving rise to colonies with a wet or slimy
appearance. Six genes were predicted (ywtABDEF and ywsC
orthologs) that may be involved in the synthesis of polyglutamic acid capsular material in B. licheniformis.

reviews

From the list of 139 sporulation genes tabulated by Kunst et
al. [10], all but six have obvious counterparts in B. licheniformis. These six exceptions (spsABCEFG) comprise an
operon involved in synthesis of a spore coat polysaccharide in
B. subtilis. In addition, the response regulator gene family
(phrACEFGI) appears to have a low level of sequence conservation between B. subtilis and B. licheniformis.

comment

three tat gene orthologs (tatAY, tatCD, and tatCY), but two
others (tatAC and tatAD) are conspicuously absent. Furthermore, specific proteins may be exported to the cell surface via
lipoprotein signal peptides or sortase factors. Lipoprotein signal peptides are cleaved with a specific signal peptidase (Lsp)
encoded by the lspA gene in B. subtilis. An lspA homolog can
be found in B. licheniformis as well, suggesting that this species may possess the ability to export lipoproteins via a similar mechanism. Lastly, surface proteins in Gram-positive
bacteria are frequently attached to the cell wall by sortase
enzymes, and genome analyses have revealed that more than
one sortase is often produced by a given species. In this
regard, three possible sortase gene homologs were detected in
the genome of B. licheniformis ATCC 14580. Together these
observations suggest that the central features of the protein
export machinery are principally conserved in B. subtilis and
B. licheniformis.

Comparison of the B. licheniformis genome with those
of other bacilli

Conclusions

The B. licheniformis ATCC 14580 gene models were compared to the list of essential genes in B. subtilis [33]. Predictably, all of the essential genes in B. subtilis have orthologs in
B. licheniformis, and most are present in a wide range of bacterial taxa. In pairwise BLAST comparisons, 66% of the predicted B. licheniformis genes have orthologs in B. subtilis,
and 55% of the gene models are represented by orthologous
sequences in B. halodurans (E-value threshold of 1 × 10-5;
Figure 4). Using a reciprocal BLASTP analysis we found 1,719
orthologs that are common to all three species (E-value
threshold of 1 × 10-5).
As noted by Lapidus et al. [9], there are broad regions of
colinearity between the genomes of B. licheniformis and B.
subtilis (Figure 5). Less conservation of genome organization

In comparisons of shared regions, the genomes of B. licheniformis ATCC 14580 and B. subtilis 168 are approximately
84.6% identical at the nucleotide level and show extensive
organizational similarity. Accordingly, their genome
sequences represent potentially useful instruments for comparative and evolutionary studies among species within the
subtilis-licheniformis group, and they may offer new information regarding the evolution and ecology of these closely
related species.
Despite the broad colinearity of B. licheniformis and B. subtilis genomes, there are local regions that are individually
unique. These include chromosome segments that comprise
prophage and insertion sequence elements, DNA restrictionmodification systems, antibiotic synthases, and a number of
extracellular enzymes and metabolic activities that are not

The subtilis-licheniformis group of bacilli includes many
strains that are used to manufacture industrial enzymes, antibiotics and biochemicals. The availability of a complete

genome from B. licheniformis should permit a thorough comparison of the biochemical pathways and regulatory networks
in B. subtilis and B. licheniformis, thereby offering new
opportunities and strategies for improvement of industrial
strains. When considering the safety of B. licheniformis as an
industrial organism it should be noted that the species is considered neither a human pathogen nor a toxigenic
microorganism [34]; however, there are reports in the literature implicating it as a causal agent of food poisoning. In
these isolated cases, specific strains were shown to produce a

present in B. subtilis. It is tempting to speculate that the presence of these genes forecasts the ability of B. licheniformis to
grow on an expanded array of substrates and/or in additional
ecological niches compared to B. subtilis. Together, the similarities and differences may hint at overlapping but non-identical environmental niches for these taxa.

toxin similar to cereulide, the emetic toxin of B. cereus [35].
Cereulide is a cyclic depsipeptide synthesized non-ribosomally [36]. Importantly, the only non-ribosomal peptide synthase genes found in the B. licheniformis ATCC 14580
genome are those that involved in synthesis of lichenysin.
Similarly, we detected no homologs of the B. cereus hemolytic
and non-hemolytic enterotoxins (Swiss-Prot accession numbers P80567, P80568, P80172, and P81242).
In a comparison of the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics among 182 soil isolates of B. licheniformis, Manachini et
al. [37] observed that while this bacterial species appears to
be phenotypically homogeneous, clear genotypic differences
are evident between isolates. They postulated the existence of
three genomovars for B. licheniformis. Similarly, De Clerck
and De Vos [38] proposed that this species consists of two lineages that can be distinguished using several molecular genotyping methods. The genome sequence data presented in
this work should provide a solid foundation on which to conduct future studies to elucidate the genotypic variation among
B. licheniformis isolates.

Materials and methods
Shotgun DNA sequencing and genome assembly
The genome of B. licheniformis ATCC 14580 was sequenced
by a combination of the whole-genome shotgun method [39]
and fosmid end sequencing [40]. Plasmid libraries were constructed using randomly sheared and MboI-digested genomic
DNA that was enriched for fragments of 2-3 kb by preparative
agarose gel electrophoresis. Approximately 49,000 random
clones were sequenced using dye-terminator chemistry
(Applied Biosystems) with ABI 377 and ABI 3700 automated
sequencers yielding approximately 6× coverage of the
genome. A combination of methods was used for gap closure,
including sequencing on fosmids [40] and primer-walking on
selected clones and PCR-amplified DNA fragments. We also
incorporated data from both ends of approximately 1,975 fosmid clones with an average insert size of 40 kb to aid in validating the final assembly. In total, the number of input reads
was 62,685, with 78.6% of these incorporated into the assembled genome sequence. Individual nucleotides were called
using TraceTuner 2.0 (Paracel), and sequence reads were
assembled into contigs using the Paracel Genome Assembler
using optimized parameters and the quality score set to >20.
Phrap, Crossmatch and Consed were used for sequence finishing [41].

Prediction and annotation of CDSs
Protein-coding regions in the assembled genome sequence
were identified using a combination of previously described
software tools including EasyGene [42], Glimmer [43] and
FrameD [44]. EasyGene was used as the primary gene finder
in these studies. It searches for protein matches in the raw
genome data to derive a good training set, and an HMM with
states for coding regions as well as ribosome-binding sites

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/10/R77

(RBSs) is estimated from the dataset. This HMM is used to
score all the predicted CDSs in the genome, and the score is
converted to a measure of significance (R-value) which is the
expected number of CDSs that would be predicted in 1 Mb of
random DNA. Gene models with R-values lower than 10 and
a log-odds score of greater than -10 were included/considered
significant. The principal advantage of this significance measure is that it properly takes into account the length distribution of random CDSs. EasyGene has been shown to match or
exceed other gene finders currently available [42]. Glimmer
was used as a secondary gene finder to aid in identification of
small genes (< 100 bp) that were sometimes missed by EasyGene. Glimmer models were post-processed with RBSFINDER [45] to pinpoint the positions of start codons by
searching for consensus Shine-Dalgarno sequences. According to the RBS states in the EasyGene HMM model, the bases
with the highest probability were AAAAGGAG (the bases in
bold type had distinctly higher probabilities compared to the
initial AA). This motif concurs with the consensus Shine-Dalgarno sequence for B. subtilis (AAAGGAGG) [46]. RBSFINDER identified the core AAGGAG motif in around 80% of
the cases for Glimmer gene predictions and adjusted the start
codon accordingly. Manual inspection and alignments to B.
subtilis homologs were also used to determine the incidence
of specific genes. During the gene-finding process, possible
errors and frameshifts were detected by both visual inspection of the CDSs to look for interrupted or truncated genes
and by deploying FrameD software [44]. Frameshifts were
resolved by re-sequencing of PCR-amplified segments or subclones. After re-sequencing and manual editing a total of 27
frameshifts remain in the genome assembly (excluding those
contained in the IS3Bli1 elements). It is not known at present
whether these represent pseudogenes or instances of programmed translational frameshifting. The positions of rRNA
operons in the genome assembly were confirmed by longrange PCR amplification using primers that annealed to
genes flanking the rRNA genes. These PCR fragments were
sequenced to high redundancy and the consensus sequences
were manually inserted into the assembly. Among the seven
rRNA operons, the nucleotide sequences of 16S and 23S genes
are at least 99% identical, differing by only one to three nucleotides in pairwise comparisons. Protein-coding sequences
were annotated in an automated fashion with the following
software applications. Predicted proteins were compared to
the nonredundant database PIR-NREF [47] and the B. subtilis genome [48] using BLASTP with a E-value threshold of 1 ×
10-5. InterProScan was used to predict putative function [49].
The InterPro analysis included comparison to PFAM [50],
TIGRFAM [51], Interpro [52] signal peptide prediction using
SignalP [20] and transmembrane domain prediction using
TMHMM [21]. These CDSs were assigned to functional categories based on the Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG)
database [53] with manual verification as described [54,55].
Phage gene boundaries were predicted using gene finding
algorithms and by homology to known bacteriophage genes.
Transfer RNA genes were identified using tRNAscan-SE [56].
