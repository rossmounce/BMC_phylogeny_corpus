Abstract
Background: Studying mitochondrial (mt) genomics has important implications for various fundamental areas, including
mt biochemistry, physiology and molecular biology. In addition, mt genome sequences have provided useful markers for
investigating population genetic structures, systematics and phylogenetics of organisms. Toxocara canis, Toxocara cati and
Toxocara malaysiensis cause significant health problems in animals and humans. Although they are of importance in human
and animal health, no information on the mt genomes for any of Toxocara species is available.
Results: The sizes of the entire mt genome are 14,322 bp for T. canis, 14029 bp for T. cati and 14266 bp for T. malaysiensis,
respectively. These circular genomes are amongst the largest reported to date for all secernentean nematodes. Their
relatively large sizes relate mainly to an increased length in the AT-rich region. The mt genomes of the three Toxocara
species all encode 12 proteins, two ribosomal RNAs and 22 transfer RNA genes, but lack the ATP synthetase subunit 8
gene, which is consistent with all other species of Nematode studied to date, with the exception of Trichinella spiralis. All
genes are transcribed in the same direction and have a nucleotide composition high in A and T, but low in G and C. The
contents of A+T of the complete genomes are 68.57% for T. canis, 69.95% for T. cati and 68.86% for T. malaysiensis, among
which the A+T for T. canis is the lowest among all nematodes studied to date. The AT bias had a significant effect on both
the codon usage pattern and amino acid composition of proteins. The mt genome structures for three Toxocara species,
including genes and non-coding regions, are in the same order as for Ascaris suum and Anisakis simplex, but differ from
Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus and Caenorhabditis elegans only in the location of the AT-rich region, whereas
there are substantial differences when compared with Onchocerca volvulus,Dirofiliria immitis and Strongyloides stercoralis.
Phylogenetic analyses based on concatenated amino acid sequences of 12 protein-coding genes revealed that the newly
described species T. malaysiensis was more closely related to T. cati than to T. canis, consistent with results of a previous
study using sequences of nuclear internal transcribed spacers as genetic markers.
Conclusion: The present study determined the complete mt genome sequences for three roundworms of human and
animal health significance, which provides mtDNA evidence for the validity of T. malaysiensis and also provides a
foundation for studying the systematics, population genetics and ecology of these and other nematodes of socioeconomic importance.

Background
Mitochondria are sub-cellular organelles involved in oxidative phosphorylation, offering energy to organisms.
They play important roles in cellular metabolism, living
and apoptosis. Within these organelles, most metazoan
species possess a compact, circular mitochondrial (mt)
genome, which varies in size from 14 to 20 kb [1]. The
metazoan mt genome usually contains a complement of
genes encoding 12–13 protein subunits of the enzymes
involved in oxidative phosphorylation, 22 transfer RNAs,
and two ribosomal RNAs. There are no introns within
genes, and no to limted spacer regions between genes
[1,2]. Studying mt genomes has important implications
for various fundamental areas, including mt biochemistry, physiology and molecular biology. In addition, mt
genome sequences have provided useful markers for
investigating population genetic structures, systematics
and phylogenetics of organisms due to their maternal
inheritance, higher mutation rates than nuclear genes and
relatively conserved genome structures [3-5].
Although Nematoda is the second largest animal phylum,
to date only over 40 complete mitochondrial DNA
sequences of nematode species have been deposited in
GenBank™ [6-15]. In the order Ascaridada, the mt
genomes of only two species have been sequenced [6,15].
The lack of knowledge of mt genomics for parasitic nematodes in this order is a major limitation for population
genetic and phylogenetic studies of the pathogens in the
order Ascaridada including the species in the genus Toxocara.
Toxocara canis, Toxocara cati and Toxocara malaysiensis are
the common ascaridoid nematodes of dogs and cats, causing significant health problems. Infection of dogs with T.
canis is quite common, with the prevalence ranging from
5.5% to 64.7% [16-18]. Infection of cats with T. cati is also
found worldwide, with infection rates of up to 25.2% to
66.2% [19-21]. More importantly, T. canis and T. cati are
of public health significance due to their larvae of being
able to invade humans and cause diseases such as ocular
larva migrans (OLM), visceral larva migrans (VLM), eosinophilic meningoencephalitis (EME) and/or covert toxocariasis (CT) [22-24]. Although they are of importance in
human and animal health, there is still no information on
the mt genomes available for any of Toxocara species.
The objectives of the present study were to fill some of
these knowledge gaps by determining the structure,
organization and sequence of the complete mt genomes
of T. canis, T. cati and T. malaysiensis of human and animal
significance, and to provide mtDNA evidence for the
recently described species T. malaysiensis [25,26]. Also, the
features of mt genomes of the three ascaridoid nematodes,
such as the gene arrangements, structures, compositions,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/224

as well as translation and initiation codons and codon
usage patterns were compared with those of other nematodes in the same order Ascaridata, namely Ascaris suum
and Anisakis simplex. The phylogenetic relationships
among these ascaridoid nematodes were also investigated
using the protein-coding amino acid sequences.

Results and Discussion
General features of the mt genome of three Toxocara
species
The complete mt genomes of T. canis, T. cati and T. malaysiensis are 14,322 bp, 14,029 bp and 14266 bp in length,
respectively. These complete mt genome sequences have
been deposited in the GenBank™ under the accession
numbers AM411108 (for T. canis), AM411622 (for T. cati)
and AM412316 (for T. malaysiensis). All three mt genomes
contain 12 protein-coding genes (cox1-3, nad1-6, nad4L,
atp6 and cytb), 22 transfer RNA genes and two ribosomal
RNA genes, but lack an atp8 gene (Table 1). These circular
genomes are typical of other nematode mitochondrial
genomes except for Trichinella spiralis in which the atp8
gene is encoded. All genes are transcribed in the same
direction as found in other members of the secernentean
nematodes sequenced to date, but in contrast to T. spiralis
and Xiphinema americanus [8,13].

The mt genome arrangement of T. canis, T. cati and T.
malaysiensis are the same as those of A. suum and A. simplex
and almost identical to the genome structures of strongylida nematodes Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus,
Cooperia oncophora and rhabditid nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans, with the exception of the relative position of an
AT-rich region and the number of non-coding regions
(NCR). In the mt genomes of the three Toxocara species,
the AT-rich region is located between trnS2 and trnN,
whereas it is positioned between trnA and trnP in A. duodenale, N. americanus, Co. oncophora and C. elegans. The
only NCR found in Toxocara spp. was between nad4 and
cox1, as has been identified in the aforementioned species.
The second NCR located between nad3 and nad5 in the
hookworms A. duodenale and N. americanus was not
found in Toxocara spp. [9]. The genome structures of these
Toxocara species differ significantly from those of
Onchocerca volvulus, Strongyloides stercoralis, Dirofiliria
immitis, X. americanus and T. spiralis in the location of the
AT-rich region, and some tRNA and protein-coding genes.
Comparison of the gene arrangements of these three Toxocara species with those of the other nine representatives
of the secernentean nematodes suggests that T. canis, T.
cati and T. malaysiensis are more closely related to A. suum
and A. simplex than to C. elegans, A. duodenale, N. americanus, Co. oncophora, O. volvulus,D. immitis and S. stercoralis.
The nucleotide compositions of the entire mtDNA
sequences for T. canis, T. cati and T. malaysiensis are biased

toward A and T, with T being the most favored nucleotide
and C the least favored, in accordance with mt genomes of
other nematodes. The content of A+T is 68.57% for T.
canis (21.9% A, 46.7% T, 22.0% G and 9.4% C), which is
the lowest of the nematodes studied to date (Table 2). The
content of A+T is 69.95% for T. cati (22.3% A, 47.7% T,
20.9% G and 9.1% C) and 68.86% for T. malaysiensis
(21.7% A, 47.2% T, 22.0% G and 9.1% C), respectively
(Table 2).

species than between each of Toxocara specis and A. suum
or A. simplex. The identities of the nucleotide and amino
acid sequences among five ascaridoid species are higher
than those among C. elegans, A. duodenale, N. americanus
and Co. oncophora (data not shown). These findings reinforce the conclusion that the three Toxocara species are
genetically more closely related to A. suum and A. simplex
than to C. elegans, A. duodenale, N. americanus and Co.
oncophora.

Protein-coding genes and codon usage patterns
The boundaries between protein-coding genes of mt
genomes of T. canis, T. cati and T. malaysiensis were determined by aligning their sequences and by identifying
translation initiation and termination codons with those
of A. suum. For each of the three Toxocara species, the
lengths of protein-coding genes cox3, nad1, nad2, nad3
and nad4 are the same as those of A. suum, whereas the
lengths of genes atp6, nad4L,nad5 and nad6 are reduced,
and the lengths of cox2 and cytb are increased (Table 1)
when compared to those of A. suum. The length of cox1 in
T. canis and T. cati is the same as that of A. suum, but the
length of cox1 in T. malaysiensis is increased (Table 3).

The predicted initiation and termination codons for the
protein-coding genes of the three Toxocara species were
compared with those of ascaridoid species (A. suum and A.
simplex) and with selected species representing different
nematode orders including the human hookworm A. duodenale, filarioid worm O. volvulus, and rhabditid species S.
stercoralis. The most common start codon for three Toxocara species is TTG (four of 12 protein-coding genes), followed by ATT (three of 12 protein-coding genes for T.
canis and T. malaysiensis, two for T. cati), ATA (two of 12
protein-coding genes for T. canis and T. cati, one for T.
malaysiensis), and ATG, GTG, GTT and GTA are used as initiation codons. GTG, which is used in the cytb of T. canis
and T. malaysiensis, and cox3 of T. malaysiensis, is not used
as a start codon in the other nematodes compared. GTA
used in the cox2 of T. malaysiensis is also used as a start
codon for nad4L in D. immitis (data not shown). Seven of
the 12 protein-coding genes were predicted to have a TAG
or TAA translation termination codon. The remaining
protein-coding genes were inferred to end with an abbreviated stop codon, such as TA or T. For the three Toxocara
species, the 3'-end of most of these genes is immediately
adjacent to a downstream tRNA gene (Table 1), which is

The inferred nucleotide and amino acid sequences for
each of the 12 mt proteins of T. canis, T. cati and T. malaysiensis were compared with those of A. suum and A. simplex. The identity of the nucleotide and amino acid
sequences is 71~90% and 72.2~95.8%, respectively
(Table 3). Based on identity, cox1 is the most conserved
protein-coding gene, while the cytb is the least conserved.
For all 12 proteins, the amino acid sequence identities are
higher when compared between each of the three Toxocara

Table 3: Comparison of protein-coding genes in size, with identity of nucleotides and predicted amino acids for five ascaridoid species

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:224

consistent with the arrangement in the mt genomes of A.
suum and A. simplex [6,15], but in contrast to that of C. elegans where both the nad1 and nad3 genes terminate in T
or TA, and are followed by the putative ATT translation
initiation codon of their downstream protein-coding
genes. The protein-coding gene nad6 ended with an abbreviated stop codon TA is followed by the putative ATT
translation initiation codon of its downstream protein
coding gene nad4L, which is similar to C. elegans.
In general, the nucleotides of metazoan mt genomes are
not randomly distributed, and such nucleotide bias is
often associated with unequal usage of synonymous
codons. The mt genome nucleotide composition of nematodes is biased toward A and T. The A+T content of protein-coding genes ranged from 63.2% to 74.9% for all
three Toxocara species (Table 2). This bias in nucleotide
composition toward AT (Table 2) affects both the codon
usage pattern and amino acid composition of proteins. In
these three species examined, all 64 possible codons were
used, and the most frequently used codon was TTT (Phe)
while the least used codon was CGC (Arg). The preferred
nucleotide usage at the third codon position of Toxocara
mt protein-coding genes reflects the overall nucleotide
composition of the mtDNA. At this position, T is the most
frequently used, and C the least frequently used. The
codons ending in G have higher frequencies than the
codons ending in A, which is similar to A. suum, but opposite to C. elegans, A. duodenale and N. americanus.
The protein-coding genes of the three Toxocara genomes
are biased toward using amino acids encoded by T-, Aand G-rich codons (data not shown). The AT-rich codons
represent amino acids Phe, Ile, Met, Tyr, Asn or Lys, and
the GC-rich codons represent Pro, Ala, Arg or Gly. T-rich
codons (with ≥2 Ts in a triplet) comprise Phe (13.4% TTT
and 0.6% TTC), Leu (9.0% TTG, 3.8% TTA, and 1.5%
CTT), Ile (5.3% ATT), Val (6.2% GTT), Tyr (4.1% TAT),
Ser (4.0% TCT), and Cys (1.5% TGT), and account for
approximately half (49.6%) of the total amino acid composition. A- and G-rich codons (with ≥2 As and Gs,
respectively) represent 9.7% and 13.3% of the total amino
acid composition, respectively (data not shown). In contrast, the proportion of C-rich codons (with ≥2 Cs) is
much lower (4.0%). This codon bias against C is even
more evident when only the third codon positions are
considered in both four fold and two fold degenerate
codon families. When the frequencies of synonymous
codons within the AT-rich group were compared, the frequency was always decreased if the third position was substituted with a C. For instance, the relative frequencies of
codons for Phe are 13.4% TTT and 0.6% TTC, respectively.
This result suggests that the third codon positions mostly
reflect mutational bias against C. A greater translational

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/224

efficiency has also been considered to be a potential cause
underlying observed codon usage bias [27].
Transfer RNA genes
Twenty-two tRNA sequences (ranging from 52 to 63 bases
in size; see Table 1) were identified in the mt genomes of
the three Toxocara species. Their putative secondary structures (not shown) are similar to those of other nematode
mtDNAs [6,7,9-11,15], with the exception of T. spiralis
[8], and differ from the conventional cloverleaf-like structures found in other metazoan mtDNA molecules. Common features of the predicted secondary structures (not
shown) of 22 tRNA genes in T. canis, T. cati and T. malaysiensis mtDNA include a 7 bp amino-acyl stem, a 4 bp
DHU stem with a 4–8 bp loop, a 5 bp anticodon stem
with a loop of 7 bp (a T always preceding an anticodon as
well as an A or a G always following an anticodon), and a
TV replacement loop of 6–12 bp with some exceptions, in
accordance with other nematodes. The exception is trnS1
(AGN) in which the DHU-arm is lacking.
Ribosomal RNA genes
The rrnS and rrnL genes of the three roundworm species
were identified by sequence comparison with those of A.
suum. The rrnS is located between trnE and trnS (UCN),
and rrnL is located between trnH and nad3. The two genes
are separated from one another by the protein-coding
genes nad3, nad5, nad6 and nad4L. The size of the rrnS
gene is 697 bp for T. canis, 696 bp for T. cati and 696 bp
for T. malaysiensis. The size of the rrnL gene is 958 bp for
T. canis, 955 bp for T. cati and 955 bp for T. malaysiensis.
The sizes of the two rRNA genes for the three Toxocara species are similar to those of other nematodes (Table 1). The
A+T contents of the rrnS for T. canis, T. cati and T. malaysiensis are 66.9%, 68.8% and 66.4%, respectively, whereas
those of the rrnL are higher (72.0%, 73.5% and 70.1%,
respectively), and A+T contents of the two genes are the
lowest among the nematodes studied to date (Table 2).
Sequence identity in the rrnS and rrnL genes is 87.5% and
83.6% between T. canis and T. cati, 87.9% and 82.4%
between T. canis and T. malaysiensis, and 91.4% and
85.2% between T. cati and T. malaysiensis, respectively.
Non-coding regions
Like A. suum and A. simplex, the longest non-coding region
(AT-region) in the three Toxocara mt genomes is located
between the trnS2 and trnN. Their sizes are 985 bp (T.
canis), 711 bp (T. cati) and 936 bp (T. malaysiensis), and
A+T contents are 79.4% (T. canis), 81.3% (T. cati) and
78.4% (T. malaysiensis), respectively, which are significantly lower than the comparable NCRs of nematodes
studied to date (Table 2). Repeated sequence motifs (CR1CR6) present in the C. elegans AT-rich region [6] are not
found in Toxocara spp. However, there are a lot of AT dinucleotide repeats in the AT-region of Toxocara mt genomes

Page 6 of 10
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:224

of which the longest consists of repeat units (34 base
pairs). Similar AT dinucleotide repeats has been found in
A. suum [6]. The function or role of these AT repeats is currently unknown [6,7]. Although nothing is yet known
about the replication process(es) in the mtDNA of parasitic nematodes, the high A+T content and the predicted
structure of the AT-rich non-coding region suggests an
involvement in the initiation of replication [28].
For the three roundworm species, the second longest noncoding region is located between genes cox1 and nad4, as
in the mt genomes of A. suum [6]. Its length is 111 bp (T.
canis), 116 bp (T. cati) and 112 bp (T. malaysiensis), with
an A+T content of 86.2%, 74.1% and 74.1%, respectively,
and is shorter than that of A. suum (117 bp). The non-coding region for the three Toxocara species could form a hairpin loop structure (AATTTTTAAAAATT).
Phylogenetic analyses
The final alignment of the amino acid sequences of 12
proteins for the six taxa (T. canis, T. cati, T. malaysiensis, A.
suum,A. simplex and O. volvulus) yield 3516 characters
(2079 variable, 339 parsimony-informative). In all three
phylogenetic analyses, three Toxocara species were clustered together (Fig. 1). T. malaysiensis, the recently
described Toxocara species from cat [26], was inferred to
be the sister species of T. cati with high bootstrap values.
This result was consistent with that of a previous study
[25] which used sequences of internal transcribed spacers

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/224

of nuclear ribosomal DNA, thus providing mt DNA evidence for the validity of T. malaysiensis as an ascaridoid of
cats. T. malaysiensis is more closely related to T. cati, the
common ascaridoid of cats, than to T. canis, the common
ascaridoid of canids.
Toxocara species was resolved being more closely related
to A. suum than to A. simplex with moderate support in the
phylogenetic analyses, which was consistent with results
of previous morphological and molecular studies [29,30].
But relationship between A. suum and A. simplex was
poorly inferred in the MP and ML analyses (Fig. 1).

Conclusion
Toxocara species are the important socio-economic parasites because they have significant impact on human
health. The determined mt genomes of the three roundworms, T. canis, T. cati and T. malaysiensis, add the mtDNA
data to the order Ascaridida, which includes a broad range
of parasites of major socio-economic importance. Determination of the complete mt genome sequences for three
Toxocara species of human and animal health significance
provides a foundation for studying the systematics, population genetics and ecology of these and other nematodes
of socio-economic importance.

Methods
Parasites and DNA extraction
The ascaridoid nematodes used in the present study were
from Zhanjiang city for T. canis, Changsha city for T. cati
and Guangzhou city for T. malaysiensis, China, respectively. Adult nematodes of three Toxocara species were
obtained from the intestines of dogs and/or cats, washed
in physiological saline, identified primarily based on
morphological characters to species, fixed in 70% (v/v)
ethanol and stored at -20°C until use. Total DNA was isolated from individual nematodes using sodium dodecylsulphate/proteinase K treatment, followed by spin-column purification (Wizard Clean-Up, Promega). The specific identity of each individual nematode was verified by
species-specific PCR amplification using the sequences of
the first and/or second internal transcribed spacers (ITS-1
and/or ITS-2) of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) as the speciesspecific genetic markers [31,32].
Long-PCR amplification and sequencing
Using primer set 5F/40R (~9 kb region) and 39F/42R (~6
kb region) [33], the entire mt genome of each Toxocara
species was amplified in two overlapping fragments by
long-PCR from approximately 20 ng of total genomic
DNA purified from an individual nematode, respectively.
The primers were designed to mt sequences found to be
relatively conserved among A. suum and C. elegans. Primer
5F (forward, 5'-TATGAGCGTCATTTATTGGG-3') and its
complementary primer 42R (reverse, 5'-CCCAATAAATGACGCTCATA-3') were designed to the nad1 gene, while
primers
39F
(forward,
5'-TAAATGGCAGTCATTAGCGTGA-3') and 40R (reverse, 5'-GAATTAAACTAATATCACGT-3') were designed to the rrnL gene [33]. Long-PCR
cycling conditions used were 92°C for 2 min (initial denaturation), then 92°C for 10 s (denaturation), 50°C for 30
s (annealing), and 60°C (for 6 kb) or 68°C (for 9 kb) for
10 min (extension) for 10 cycles, followed by 92°C for 10
s, 50°C for 30 s, and 60°C (for 6 kb) or 68°C (for 9 kb)
for 10 min for 20 cycles, with a cycle elongation of 10 s for
each cycle and a final extension at 60 or 68°C for 7 min.
Each PCR reaction yielded a single band detected in a
0.8% (w/v) agarose gel upon ethidium-bromide staining
(not shown). PCR products were sent to TaKaRa Company (Dalian, China) for sequencing using a primer walking strategy, and the following primers were used for
sequencing the complete genomes of three Toxocara species: MW1F (5'-ATATTAGATTGTAAATCTAAAG-3'), MW51R (5'-ACACGAAAAACCCAAAAATT-3'), MW5-1F (5'-AT

Sequence analyses
Sequences were assembled manually and aligned against
the complete mt genome sequence of A. suum (GenBank™
accession number NC001327) using the program Clustal
X to identify gene boundaries. The open-reading frames
and codon usage profiles of protein-coding genes were
analyzed using the program MacVector 4.1.4 (Kodak, version 4.0). Translation initiation and translation termination codons were identified based on comparison with
those reported previously for A. suum. The amino acid
sequences inferred for the mt genes of three ascaridoids
were aligned with those of A. simplex (GenBank™ accession number AY994157) and A. suum using Clustal X.
Based on pairwise alignments, amino acid identity (%)
was calculated for homologous genes. Codon usage was
examined using the relationships between the nucleotide
composition of codon families and amino acid occurrence, where the genetic codons are partitioned into ATrich codons (i.e. those which are AT-rich at the first two
codon positions), GC-rich codons (those which are GCrich at the first two codon positions) and unbiased
codons. For analyzing ribosomal RNA genes, putative secondary structures of 22 tRNA genes were identified using
tRNAscan-SE [34], or by recognizing potential secondary
structures and anticodon sequences by eye by aligning
sequences with those of A. simplex and A. suum.
Phylogenetic analyses
Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the five
ascaridoid species (T. canis, T. cati, T. malaysiensis, A.
suum,A. simplex) as ingroups, and one filarioid species (O.
volvulus) serving as outgroup (GenBank™ accession
number AF015193), based on amino acid sequences of 12
protein-coding genes. Amino acid sequences for each gene

Page 8 of 10

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:224

were individually aligned using Clustal X under default
setting, and then concatenated into single alignments for
phylogenetic analyses. Standard unweighted maximum
parsimony (MP) were performed in PAUP* 4.0b10 [35]
using heuristic searches with tree-bisection-reconnection
branch swapping and 1000 random-addition sequence
replicates with 10 trees held at each step. The Dayhoff
matrix model was utilized in the analyses of neighbour
joining (NJ), implemented by MEGA 3.1 [36], and maximum likelihood (ML) implemented by PhyML 2.1 [37].
Branch supports were estimated by bootstrap analysis of
1000 replicates for NJ and MP trees, and 100 replicates for
ML tree.
