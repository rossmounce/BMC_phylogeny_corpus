Introduction
The seventh annual Midsouth Computational Biology
and Bioinformatics (MCBIOS) conference took place
February 19 and 20, 2010 at Arkansas State University
in Jonesboro, AR, presided over by Daniel Berleant, this
year’s President of MCBIOS. Keynote speakers were
Elaine Ostrander of NIH, renowned for her work on
dog genomics, Clayton Naeve, CIO of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, and Robert Cottingham, Leader of the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics
Group, Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The recordbreaking attendance exceeded 200 participants which
necessitated parallel talk sessions for the first time. Student oral presentation award winners were Heidi Pagan
(first place) of Mississippi State University (MSU), Juliet
Tang (second place) of MSU, and Aleksandra Markovets
(third) of Mississippi Valley State University. In addition,
a record number of posters were also presented. Due to
the number of posters, student poster awards were
given in two categories, Biological Focus and Computational Focus. Winners were N. Platt and V. Chaitankar
(1st place), G. Cooper and L. Pillai (2nd), and M.
Ammari and C. Gearheart (3rd). Reflecting the integration of these foci in the field, winners in one category
frequently scored high in the other category as well.
MCBIOS is also pleased to have this year acquired legal
status as a non-profit organization.

Full list of author information is available at the end of the article

publication in these proceedings out of a total of forty
three papers submitted for consideration (~65%). The
number of papers submitted for consideration was the
largest submitted since the inception of MCBIOS with a
34% increase over last year’s proceedings [1-19], and the
highest number of papers submitted to date, reflecting a
healthy growth in conference participation. All papers
were peer-reviewed by at least two reviewers. Our goal
for inclusion of papers was to be inclusive, yet rigorous
in the peer-review process such that accepted papers are
both high quality and reflective of the work presented at
the conference. Papers generally fell into five categories:

Genomic analysis
Bioinformatics was largely born as a field through the
need to analyze and understand sequence data. Partly as
a result of ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology,
the field has seen a strong resurgence recently with new
computational methods being developed and applied to
downstream applications such as the identification of
human mutations [20-25] as well as meta-genomics and
whole genome sequencing [26-31]. In these proceedings,
several new methods and applications are reported.
Hong Fang, et al. describe an expansion of the FDAdeveloped, ArrayTrackTM genomics tool, into a platform
that supports microbial data to enable the rapid detection of food borne pathogenic bacteria during outbreak
scenarios [32]. Xu et al. describe new SNP (single
nucleotide polymorphism) and QTL (quantitative trait
locus) libraries for the ArrayTrack system which provide
users with extensive data including links to other
resources, and motivated in part by the need to augment
gene association study results with biological context
[33]. Christopher Bottoms et al. report on the new webbased tool, IView, which graphically displays and makes

searchable introgression data by marker name, chromosome number, or map position [34].
Quest and colleagues working in the Cottingham
laboratory address the problem of brittle genome annotation systems with an OWL-based approach that provides several significant advantages [35]. Work reported
by Markovets and colleagues on identifying promoter
regions showed that a new neural network-based algorithm outperformed the method of stress-induced
duplex destabilization [36]. Smits and Ouverney present
a software system that assists users in analyzing
sequence data to find phylogenetic trees, while avoiding
pitfalls associated with this process as commonly practiced [37].
An examination of substitution rates over evolutionary
time by Ulrich Melcher compared viral and non-viral
sequences to reveal that the rate of nucleotide interchanges in plant viruses is not constant, impacting phylogeny studies. The evidence suggests that different
evolutionary rules may apply to recent divergences than
to those linked to distant speciation events [38].
An in depth analysis of the two forms of Bovine Viral
Diarrhea, a worldwide cattle disease, was completed by
Mais Ammari et al. using a proteomics approach to
evaluate the host protein expression differences. Two
gene sets were found, each specific to one disease form
which showed significant functional differences [39].
Arun Rawat et al. address the need for additional genomic information for Northern bobwhite, an avian species
critical to ecosystem maintenance. Using next generation sequencing of cDNAs from a multi-tissue library,
they generated ESTs which were pipelined into a unigene database and made publicly available at a searchable website [40].
Cyriac Kandoth et al [41] mined the Arabidopsis
thaliana genome using a new method to scan genome
sequences for partially symmetric inverted repeats that
might represent miRNA precursors. Chao Di et al [42]
carried out a comparative genome analysis of the Prohibitin gene, important functions from diseases to
development, finding that the gene family is conserved
across different kingdoms falling into five different
clades and indicating that different duplication events
were involved for gene family expansion, especially the
segmental duplications in Arabidopsis. The conserved
gene evolution indicated that the study in the model
species can be translational to human disease studies.
Rowena Kelly et al [43] have constructed a database
with a web-based interface that integrates large datasets on Aspergillus flavus resistance in Maize such as
gene expression, proteomic, QTL genetic mapping
studies and sequence data from the literature to help
identify and select candidate A. flavus resistance
genes.

3D/structural analysis

Biological information may be encoded in a one-dimensional sequence, but its manifestation takes place in
three-dimensional space in the form of proteins, cells
and tissues among other structures. Computational analysis and prediction of these structures is challenging, to
say the least, and an active area of recent bioinformatics
interest [44-48]. Computational simulations are critical
for testing proposed solutions, as well as in rationally
engineering more specific binding/activity for drug
candidates.
To better understand and improve of the creation of
anti-inflammatory drugs through inhibition of lipoxygenase, an essential enzyme in the inflammatory pathway, Shuju Bai et al. report on a method for modeling
interactions between 8R-lipoxygenase and its substrate
[49]. A mixed reality surgical simulator with a VICON
motion tracking system, developed for the rasping procedure in artificial cervical disc replacement surgeries is
described by Tansel Halic et al., which can serve as an
important training and practice tool for surgeons [50].
The potential of using hydrogen deuterium exchange
(HDX) mass spectrometry for analyzing enzymes that
degrade cell walls is explored by Uzuner et al.[51]. They
report that the HDX mass spectrometry can be a powerful tool for exploring the molecular mechanisms of
enzyme functions.
Sinan Kockara et al [52] and Mutlu Mete et al [53]
examined ways to automatically quantitate and define
the extent of malignant melanomas on skin while offering speed and consistency in detection of the lesions
borders, elements especially useful in areas without dermatologists. Kockara et al compared density based clustering and Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithms for
border detection in dermoscopy images finding that
density based clustering performed best with a low border error, high precision and recall; however, the Fuzzy
C-Means clustering algorithm had poor performance
especially in border detection. Mete et al proposed two
new methods, boundary driven density based clustering
based algorithms which performed better delineation
with noisy images and an active contour model that
gave the best detection with optimum parameters.
Denise Koessler et al [54] developed a tool to predict
secondary RNA structures based on the novel approach
of using graph-theoretic values as input for a neural network and computes the probability of secondary RNA
structure.

Systems biology
There are many areas within biology that are amenable
to computational analysis, each of which is usually
approached separately. Somewhat recently, the term
“systems biology” has emerged to describe

Wren et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11(Suppl 6):S1
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/S6/S1

interconnected analyses, particularly those that help
reduce complexity in these systems, as defined by the
number of interconnections between component parts,
into a more functional understanding (e.g., input and
output). The term “systems biology” is often used
broadly and not always consistently, but is an emergent
area of high interest in bioinformatics [55-57].
A novel method for identifying subnetwork markers in
a human protein-protein interaction network is
described by Junjie Su et al.[58]. They report the identification of subnetwork markers that improve upon current gene-based and pathway-based markers in their
discriminative power, reproducibility and classification.
Elina Tjioe et al. report on the development of a Webbased gene-discovery bioinformatics tool, FAUN (Feature Annotation Using Nonnegative matrix factorization), which identifies implied gene relationships from
biomedical literature, enabling hypotheses on functional
characterization [59].
A paper by Vijender Chaitankar, et al., explores the
important problem of inferring gene regulatory networks
from time sliced microarray data. They claim that
mutual information (MI) based approaches have inherent limits to their capabilities in this context which they
were able to improve upon with algorithms based on
modifications to the mutual information metric [60].
Kumar and Nanduri present a downloadable database,
HPIDB, which serves as a resource of host-pathogen
protein-protein interactions integrated non-redundantly
from public databases. The authors report on the flexibility of the database for querying and an output format
which allows portage to downstream applications [61].

Microarray studies
Microarrays have long been a subject of bioinformatics
analysis not only for better understanding transcription,
a process affected by both genetic and epigenetic factors
[62,63], but also as a model for large-scale analysis of
genetic behavior.
A new non-stationary Dynamic Bayesian Network
with a flexible lag choosing mechanism that detects
potential genetic regulators and has improved structure
prediction is reported by Yi Jia and Jun Huan [64].
Zhining Wen et al. address two interesting QC questions of whether expired Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays, an expensive resource, are still useful up to four
years after expiration and if RNA stored at -80°C for the
same period was suitable as template source. In spite of
a decrease in sensitivity, the authors found that these
arrays generated data consistent with that from unexpired arrays and report favorably on the stability of the
RNA [65].
