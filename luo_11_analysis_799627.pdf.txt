Abstract
Background: Panax notoginseng (Burk) F.H. Chen is important medicinal plant of the Araliacease family. Triterpene
saponins are the bioactive constituents in P. notoginseng. However, available genomic information regarding this
plant is limited. Moreover, details of triterpene saponin biosynthesis in the Panax species are largely unknown.
Results: Using the 454 pyrosequencing technology, a one-quarter GS FLX titanium run resulted in 188,185 reads
with an average length of 410 bases for P. notoginseng root. These reads were processed and assembled by 454
GS De Novo Assembler software into 30,852 unique sequences. A total of 70.2% of unique sequences were
annotated by Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) similarity searches against public sequence databases. The
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) assignment discovered 41 unique sequences representing 11
genes involved in triterpene saponin backbone biosynthesis in the 454-EST dataset. In particular, the transcript
encoding dammarenediol synthase (DS), which is the first committed enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of major
triterpene saponins, is highly expressed in the root of four-year-old P. notoginseng. It is worth emphasizing that the
candidate cytochrome P450 (Pn02132 and Pn00158) and UDP-glycosyltransferase (Pn00082) gene most likely to be
involved in hydroxylation or glycosylation of aglycones for triterpene saponin biosynthesis were discovered from
174 cytochrome P450s and 242 glycosyltransferases by phylogenetic analysis, respectively. Putative transcription
factors were detected in 906 unique sequences, including Myb, homeobox, WRKY, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH),
and other family proteins. Additionally, a total of 2,772 simple sequence repeat (SSR) were identified from 2,361
unique sequences, of which, di-nucleotide motifs were the most abundant motif.
Conclusion: This study is the first to present a large-scale EST dataset for P. notoginseng root acquired by nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) technology. The candidate genes involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis,
including the putative CYP450s and UGTs, were obtained in this study. Additionally, the identification of SSRs
provided plenty of genetic makers for molecular breeding and genetics applications in this species. These data will
provide information on gene discovery, transcriptional regulation and marker-assisted selection for P. notoginseng.
The dataset establishes an important foundation for the study with the purpose of ensuring adequate drug
resources for this species.

Background
Panax notoginseng (Burk) F.H. Chen is highly valued
medicinal plant of the Araliaceae family [1]. P. notoginseng is distributed in the southwestern region of China,
Burma and Nepal [2]. Presently, this species can only be
found in cultivated forms [3]. In China, P. notoginseng is
cultiviated commercially in Wenshan County, Yunnan
province [4]. The roots of this plant, called notoginseng
or sanchi, are commonly used as a hemostatic agent as
well as a tonic to promote quality of life. In addition,
the herb of sanqi possesses the bioactivities of antihypertensive, antithrombotic, anti-atherosclerotic and neuroprotective actions [3]. The ingredients detected in P.
notoginseng include triterpene saponins, non-protein
amino acids, polyacetylenes, phytosterols, flavonoids,
and polysaccharides, many of which have pharmacological activities and are useful in the treatment of some
diseases [2]. Among these compounds, triterpene saponins, a group of ginsenosides, are considered to be the
principal bioactive components responsible for the pharmacological features [5-7]. Approximately 60 triterpene
saponins have been isolated from P. notoginseng including ginsenosides, notoginsenosides, and gypenosides [2].
The major ginsenosides are the dammarane glycosides,
and the ginsenoside Rg1, Rb1, Rd, and notoginsenoside
R1 are considered as the major constituents found in
the P. notoginseng root [8]. All the dammarane saponins
have been classified as two groups: the protopanaxadiols
group and the protopanaxatriols group [2]. The oleanane-type saponin, Ro, which exists in Asian ginseng
(Panax ginseng) and American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius), have not been found in P. notoginseng based on
the evidence from phytochemical studies [2].
Triterpene saponins are synthesized via the mevalonic
acid (MVA) pathway [9], which is ubiquitous in plants
and provides the precursor 2,3-oxidosqualene for terpenoid biosynthesis. The cyclization of 2,3-oxidosqalene by
oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) combined with the following modifications on the triterpene skeletons including
hydroxylation and glycosidation leads to the production
of various ginsenosides (Figure 1). The OSC genes
including dammarenediol synthase (DS), b-amyrin (bAS), lupeol synthase (LS) and cycloartenol synthase
(CAS) have been isolated in plants [10-13]. The characterization of DS, the first key enzyme committed in the
biosynthesis of dammarane-type saponins, was profoundly advanced the studies on triterpene saponin biosynthesis in P. ginseng [10,14]. However, little is known
about the molecular mechanism of the biosynthetic
pathway downstream of cyclization involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis (Figure 1). Some specific cytochrome
P450-dependent monoxygenases (CYP450s) and UDPglycosyltransferases (UGTs), which might be existed in

Page 2 of 15

Panax plants, are proposed to catalyze the conversion of
dammarenediol-II or b-amyrin to various ginsenosides
and the modification on ginsenosides. In our previous
study, one candidate CYP450 and four candidate UGTs
most likely to be involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis
have been selected from P. quinquefolius [15]. These
candidate genes were screened from the 454-EST dataset of P. quinquefolius root based on the analysis of tissue-specific expression pattern and methyl jasmonate
(MeJA) induction [15].
Despite its pharmacological importance, the transcriptomic and genomic data of P. notoginseng are very limited and only 95 ESTs are available in the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database.
The limited transcriptomic data hinder the study of triterpene saponin biosynthetic mechanisms in P. notoginseng. Expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis is a useful
tool for the purposes of gene discovery especially in
non-model plants for which no reference genome
sequences are available [16]. ESTs represent the
expressed portion of a genome [17,18] and can be used
to characterize patterns of gene expression in special tissues [19]. The discovery and prediction of genes
involved in triterpene saponin and other secondary
metabolite biosynthesis was performed based on EST
analysis [15,20,21]. The triterpene carboxylic acid glucosyltransferase was characterized by mining ESTs from
the developing seeds of Saponaria vaccaria [22]. The
licorice-amyrin 11-oxidase gene, which plays a key role
in the biosynthesis of the triterpene sweetener glycyrrhizin, was identified from the ESTs generated from the
stolons of Glycyrrhiza uralensis [23]. In addition, ESTs
are a rich source of gene-derived molecular markers (e.
g. simple sequence repeat, SSR) which will be used for
germplasm breeding or physical mapping [24]. The
next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies improve
sequencing depth and render large-scale EST projects
more feasible [25-27].
Herein we present the results of the study designed to
characterize the transcriptome of P. notoginseng root
using NGS technology based on 454 GS FLX Titanium
platform. Our ultimate goal is to discover the candidate
genes that encode enzymes in the triterpene saponin
biosynthetic pathway and provide an overview of transcriptome, as well as produce molecular markers of
EST-SSRs for facilitation the marker-assisted breeding
of this species.

(Table 1). After trimming adaptor sequences and removing those reads shorter than 50 bp, a total of 184,785
reads were assembled into 30,852 unique sequences
including 14,005 contigs and 16,847 singletons (Table
1). The lengths of contigs ranged from 95 to 10,423 bp
with average size of 581 bp (Table 1). The size distributions for these reads and contigs are shown in Figure 2.
Singletons, which represent unique transcripts expressed
at low levels in the samples and with only one read,
exhibited an average length of 343 bp in P. notoginseng
454-EST dataset (Table 1). The length of these unique
sequences was sufficient to enable annotations with high
accuracy [28]. An overview of 454 sequencing and
assembly for P. notoginseng was summarized in Table 1.
Unique sequence annotation and highly expressed
transcript analyses

The annotation for P. notoginseng unique sequences was
based on sequence similarity searches against public
databases. These databases included SwissProt, KEGG,
The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR), NCBI
non-redundant protein (Nr), and NCBI non-redundant
nucleotide (Nt) database. The number and percentage of
the annotated unique sequences were summarized in
Additional file 1. In total, 21,672 (70.2%) P. notoginseng
unique sequences were annotated and the remaining
(29.8%) unique sequences had no match to any
sequences in the public databases (Table 1). The annotation rate for P. notoginseng unique sequences is similar
to that of P. quinquefolius root [15] and P. ginseng root
[29] transcriptomes. The comparisons of the 30,852 P.
notoginseng unique sequences with all the P. quinquefolius [15] and P. ginseng [29] unique sequences derived
from 454 sequencing using BLAST search (E-value <=

between P. notoginseng and P. quinquefolius [15] unique
sequences showed that 19,226 P. notoginseng unique
sequences had sequence similarity to P. quinquefolius
unique sequences, and the remained 11,626 unique
sequences were the P. notoginseng special transcripts.
Similarly, a total of 19,479 P. notoginseng unique
sequences had sequence similarity to P. ginseng unique
sequences [29], and the rest 11,373 unique sequences
were the P. notoginseng special transcripts.

library of the 4-year old P. notoginseng root were shown
in Table 2. The most abundant P. notoginseng transcript
(with 3,358 reads) had no hit to any sequences of the

The abundance of these transcripts was consistent with
the fact that starch is the major constituent in the P.
notoginseng root. It is noteworthy that three transcripts
encoding the key enzymes of Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (AACT), squalene epoxidase (SE) and dammarenediol synthase (DS) were also abundant in P. notoginseng
root (Table 2). These enzymes play important roles in
triterpene saponin biosynthesis, particularly for DS,
which is the first committed enzyme in the biosynthetic
pathway of major triterpene saponins. In comparison,
DS was more abundant in P. notoginseng root than in P.
quinquefolius [15] and P. ginseng root [29]. The high
expression levels of these transcripts encoding DS indicated that triterpene saponin biosynthesis is active in
the growth stage of 4-year old of this species. Therefore,
the genes (e.g. some specific CYP450s and UGTs)
involved in the downstream of triterpene saponin biosynthetic pathway are likely to be abundant in this 454EST dataset. In addition, several transcripts encoding
heat shock proteins, which have the functions in the
abiotic stress response in plants [31], were also
expressed highly in P. notoginseng root (Table 2).

transcriptome [32]. A total of 18,689 P. notoginseng
unique sequences were assigned with GO terms based
on sequence similarity to proteins in TAIR database
(Figure 3). In cellular component group, the unique
sequences related to the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria,
ribosome, and cell wall were well-represented categories
(Figure 3A). The transcripts belonging to the major subgroups of molecular function category included protein
binding, kinase activity, and receptor binding or activity
(Figure 3B). The best-represented groups of biological
processes were response to abiotic or biotic stimuli, protein metabolism, cell organization and biogenesis (Figure
3C). These GO annotations provide a comprehensive
information on transcript functions of P. notoginseng.
The KEGG assignments provide an alternative functional annotation of genes associated biochemical pathways with their corresponding enzyme commission (EC)
numbers [33]. 16,300 P. notoginseng unique sequences
were assigned to KEGG annotations based on sequence
similarity searches against the KEGG database. A total
of 3,862 unique sequences among the 16,300 annotated
sequences were assigned to biochemical pathways
(Additional file 2). The remaining (12,438) unique
sequences were not assigned to any known biochemical
pathway (Additional file 2). In detail, a total of 1,349
unique sequences were assigned to the metabolic pathways, including the well-represented pathways of amino
acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (Additional file 2). The number of

(Figure 1 andTable 3). Pathways related to genetic information processing, protein families, and cellular processes were also well represented by P. notoginseng
unique sequences (Additional file 2).

unique sequences involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites was shown in Additional file 3. In
particular, the transcripts encoding most of all the
known enzymes (except the HMG-CoA synthase,
HMGS) involved in the triterpene saponin biosynthesis
were discovered in this 454-EST dataset, including
acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (AACT), HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR), mevalonate kinase (MVK), phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK), mevalonate diphosphate
decarboxylase (MVD), IPP isomerase (IPPI), geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS), farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), squalene synthase (SS), squalene

Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are the most feasible
genetic markers for plant breeding and genetic applications [34]. A total of 2,772 putative SSR motifs were
identified from 2,361 P. notoginseng unique sequences
with 8.98% (2,772/30,852) frequency (Additional file 4).
The frequency of SSRs identified among P. notoginseng
454-ESTs was similar to that of some dicotyledonous
species [35]. These motifs included di-, tri-, tetra-,
penta- and hexa-nucleotides with the lengths ranging
from 2 to 6 bp. Among the SSR-containing unique
sequences, the majority (85.51%) had a single SSR motif
in every sequence.
The di-nucleotide motifs were the most abundant in
454-ESTs, which is similar to results obtained from
other plants [36]. The occurrence of di- and tri-nucleotide SSR motifs and the number of repeats were presented in Table 4. With a frequency of over sixty
percent (67.53%, 1,872/2,772), di-nucleotides were about
two times more abundant than tri-nucleotides (25%,
693/2,772), followed by tetra-nucleotides (3.79%, 105/
2,772) and penta- and hexa-nucleotides (3.68%, 102/
2,772). Among the di-nucleotide repeat classes, AG/GA/
CT/TC (57.3%) was the most frequent dimer motif.
Other frequent dimer motifs included AT/TA and AC/
CA/GT/TG (Table 4). The CG repeats were very infrequent in the plant (0.1%), which is consistent with previous observations [36-38]. Among the tri-nucleotide
repeats, AAG/GAA/AGA/CTT/TTC/TCT was the largest repeat class followed by ATC/CAT/TCA/GAT/
ATG/TGA and AGC/CAG/GCA/TGC/CTG/GCT
(Table 4). Our findings indicated that unique sequences
containing SSR markers were indeed abundant in P.
notoginseng. In particular, several SSR motifs were
linked with the unique sequences encoding enzymes (e.
g. AACT, HMGR, SE, SS, DS) involved in triterpene
saponin biosynthesis (Additional file 5). These unique
sequence-derived markers generated in this study represent a valuable genetic resource for future studies of this
species as well as related Panax species.
Discovery of transcripts encoding putative transcription

454-EST dataset was the MYB family proteins characterized by DNA-binding domains. In Arabidopsis, the MYB
family, comprising 163 genes, is also one of the largest
transcription factor families [40]. The Homeobox proteins were another set of highly expressed transcription
factors in P. notoginseng. Homeobox genes regulate various developmental aspects in plants, such as the regulation of stem cell specification and organogenesis [41].
The high expression level of MYB and Homeobox proteins in P. notoginseng may be linked to response to specific habitats and developmental regulation. Given that
the functions of TFs vary in plants, the putative functions of these transcription factors potentially involved
in environmental responses and/or developmental regulation in P. notoginseng will be characterized in a future
study. It is noteworthy that the discovery of these candidate TFs in our 454-EST dataset may provide useful
information for future research.
Candidate genes encoding enzymes involved in the
biosynthesis of triterpene saponins
Discovery of the transcripts encoding the known enzymes
invioved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis

Most of all the known enzymes involved in MVA pathway for triterpene saponin biosynthesis were discovered
in P. notoginseng 454-EST dataset (Table 3). As shown
in Figure 1, the oxidosqualene is a precursor in the biosynthesis of triterpenoids in higher plants [9]. The cyclization of 2,3-oxidosqualene, catalyzed by OSCs (e.g. DS
or AS), is the rate-limited step for triterpene saponin
biosynthesis (Figure 1). After the cyclization, the hydroxylation and glycosidation, which are catalyzed by
CYP450s and UGTs in turn, play important roles in the

production of various triterpene saponins (Figure 1).
Dammarane-type saponins are major saponins in P.
notoginseng root. DS participates in the cyclization of
2,3-oxidosqualene to form the dammarane skeletons in
P. ginseng [10,14]. It is noteworthy that the transcript

for the full-length P. notoginseng DS (containing 1,018
reads) was found in the cDNA library. The alignment of
amino acid sequences of DS from P. ginseng, P. notoginseng, and P. quinquefolius was shown in Figure 4. DS
sequences of P. quinquefolium and P. notoginseng were

deposited in NCBI GenBank with Accession No.
GU997679 and GU997680, respectively. All three DSs
have 769 amino acid residues and display high similarity.
At the protein level, DSs exhibit 99.5% identity between
P. ginseng and P. quinquefolius, 99.0% identity between
P. quinquefolius and P. notoginseng, and 98.7% identity
between P. ginseng and P. notoginseng, indicating that P.
ginseng and P. quinquefolius are more closely related.
This conclusion agrees with that drawn from the alignment of TrnK and 18S rRNA sequences [42].
The oleanane-type saponin (Ro) has not been detected
in P. notoginseng based on the phytochemical studies
[2]. Surprisingly, two P. notoginseng singleton sequences
(FW1NBNE02D50IR and FW1NBNE02D30JP) matched
to b-AS of Panax ginseng. The presence of the b-ASs in
P. notoginseng was further confirmed by RT-PCR and
the PCR products were sequenced (Data not shown).
The existence of the transcripts for b-ASs in P. notoginseng was seemingly conflicted with previous reports
claiming that oleanane-type ginsenosides do not exist in
P. notoginseng [2,43]. Therefore, we presumed that
either oleanane-type ginsenosides were present in P.
notoginseng at levels too low to be detected phytochemically, or oleanane-type ginsenosides in fact did not exist
in P. notoginseng, despite the presence of b-AS, might
due to the lack of biosynthetic genes downstream of bAS.
Discovery of the candidate CYP450s and UGTs might be
involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis by phylogenetic
analysis

Characterization of specific CYP450s or UGTs involved
in triterpene saponin biosynthesis in Panax genus will
facilitate to elucidation of the triterpene saponin biosynthetic pathway. CYP450s are generally involved in the
biosynthesis of terpenoids, sterols, lignins, hormones,
fatty acids, pigments, and phytoalexins in plants [44].
Some CYP450s are proposed to participate in the oxidation of the dammarane skeleton at C-12 and the other
at C-6 toward the production of protopanaxadiol and
protopanaxatriol, respectively [10,45]. Previous studies
have characterized CYP88D6 from Glycyrrhiza uralensis
(CYP85 clan) [23] and CYP93E1 from Glycine max
(CYP71 clan) [46], both of which were involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis. Therefore, the CYP450s
belonging to CYP85 and CYP71 clan might be involved
in ginsenoside biosynthesis in Panax genus. Glycosylation, catalyzed by glycosyltransferases (GTs), transfers
the activated saccharides to an aglycone substrate in the
modification on ginsenoside biosynthesis. This enzymatic conjugation based on glycosylation can stabilize
the product and alter its physiological activity [47]. The
dammarane- and oleanane-type aglycones have ginsenoside bioactivity after the glycosylation catalyzed by
UGTs. UGT73K1 and UGT71G1 from Medicago

Page 9 of 15

truncatula [48] and UGT74M1 from Saponaria vaccaria
[22] have been identified and characterized with functions in triterpene saponin biosynthesis. Recently, several CYP450s and UGTs were found as candidate genes
involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis in P. quinquefolius
and P. ginseng in our previous studies [15,29]. Particularly, one CYP450 (contig00248) and four UGTs (contig01001, contig14976, contig15451, and contig16321)
were selected as candidate genes most likely to be
involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis based on their
MeJA-inducible and tissue specific expression patterns
in P. quinquefolius [15].
In this study, a total of 174 CYP450 (Additional file 8)
and 242 GT (Additional file 9) unique sequences were
found in the P. notoginseng cDNA library. As reported
for P. ginseng and other plants, enzymes in the same
biosynthetic pathway are usually co-expressed
[14,48,49]. Hence, DS was expressed abundantly (with
1,018 reads) in the root of P. notoginseng, indicating that
other genes in the triterpene saponin biosynthetic pathway might also expressed at higher levels in the P. notoginseng root. Based on this knowledge, CYP450- and
UGT-unique sequences that contain more than 10 reads
from the P. notoginseng root cDNA library were found
as candidate enzymes involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis. Thus, 25 CYP450s and 16 UGTs were
selected, among which 15 CYP450s and 8 UGTs had
full-length sequences after assembly and using RACE
(rapid amplification of cDNA end) method. The primers
used for RACE were listed in Additional file 10. These
cDNA sequences have been submitted to the NCBI
database and given accession number GU997664GU997678 for CYP450s and GU997656-GU997663 for
UGTs.
The phylogenetic relationship between the15 fulllength CYP450s of P. notoginseng and characterized
CYP450s from other plants was depicted in Figure 5.
Four CYP450s (Pn00445, Pn00158, Pn01024, and
Pn04451) belonged to the group representing the
CYP85 clan which comprises CYP88D6 from G. uralensis, a licorice b-amyrin 11-oxidase with a key role in the
biosynthesis of the triterpene sweetener glycyrrhizin [23]
(Figure 5). Thus, the four CYP450s constituted a subgroup and were related to CYP88D6 (Figure 5). Interestingly, the transcript of Pn00158 had high identity to the
P. quinquefolius candidate CYP450 (contig00248) [15]
(Data not shown), which was likely to be involved in
ginsenoside biosynthesis. Seven CYP450s (Pn02132,
Pn02294, Pn01023, Pn13620, Pn01796, Pn03717, and
Pn01705) belonged to the group representing the
CYP71 clan (Figure 5). It is noteworthy that Pn02132
was phylogenetically close to CYP93E1 (Figure 5), which
was the first triterpene hydroxylase identified from a
plant species [46]. Therefore, Pn02132 and Pn00158

were lead candidate CYP450s involved in triterpene
saponin biosynthesis.
Phylogenetic analysis using an unrooted distance tree
showed the relationship of P. notoginseng UGT
sequences to other functionally characterized members
of plant UGT families (Figure 6). Three UGTs
(Pn00082, Pn02086, and Pn13895) belonged to the
group consisting of triterpene glycosyltransferases
(UGT73K1, UGT71G1) from Medicago truncatula (Figure 6). Among them, Pn13895 was regarded as a lead
candidate UGT responsible for triterpene saponin biosynthesis, because of its close relation to UGT71G1(Figure 6). Characterization of these candidate CYP450s and
UGTs will pave the way to illustrate the biosynthetic
pathways of triterpene saponins in P. notoginseng and
other related Panax species. Although many of candidate genes involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis
were discovered in this study, the functional identification of these genes has not be carried out in this study.
They will be the focus of study in the future

Conclusions
In this study, a large-scale 454-EST investigation of P.
notoginseng root was performed based on 454 pyrosequencing. This 454-EST dataset from P. notoginseng
root contribute significantly to provide a large number
of transcripts for gene discovery in this medicinal plant.
The description of the expressed genes and distribution
of gene functions was illustrated according to GO analysis and KEGG assignment. A number of genes involved
in triterpene saponin biosynthesis, including cytochrome
P450s and glycosyltransferases, were discovered in our
EST dataset. More importantly, a handful of candidate
CYP450s and UGTs that are most likely to be involved
in the biosynthesis of triterpene saponins were found
based on phylogenetic analysis. Many transcription factors and EST-SSR markers were identified as well.
These data will provide comprehensive information on
gene discovery, transcriptome profiling, transcriptional
regulation, and molecular markers for P. notoginseng.
This study will contribute to further improvements on
this medicinal plant through marker-assisted breeding
or genetic engineering on this species as well as for
other medicinal plants in the Araliaceae family.
Methods
Plant material

The 4-year-old Panax notoginseng cultivated on farms
was routinely harvested for medical purposes. The P.
notoginseng was collected from the fields of Wenshan
County, Yunnan Province, China. After cleaning, the
root tissues were cut into small pieces and immediately
frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until
further processing.

RNA preparation

Total RNA was isolated using the Plant RNA Isolation
Mini Kit (BioTeke, Beijing, China). The total RNA was
treated with DNase I (TURBO DNase; Ambion, USA) at
a concentration of 1.5 units/μg of total RNA. The RNA
quality was tested using 1% ethidium bromide-stained
(EtBr-stained) agarose gels and the concentration was
assessed using a GeneQuant100 spectrophotometer (GE
Healthcare, UK) prior to cDNA synthesis.
cDNA synthesis and 454 pyrosequencing

The first-strand cDNA was produced using 2.1 μg of
total RNA extracted from the root of P. notoginseng
according to the instructions provided with Clontech’s
SMART cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech, USA) with slight
modifications as our previous study [15]: in order to
remove the long poly(A/T) tails in cDNA sequences, a
modified synthetic poly (T) primer (5’-AAG CAG TGG
TAT CAA CGC AGT GCA GT(20)VN-3’) containing a
BsgI digestion site upstream of the poly (T) segment
was used in combination with the Clontech SMART IV
primer to synthesize the first-strand cDNA. The cDNA
was amplified using PCR Advantage II polymerase
(Clontech, USA) to synthesize the double-strand cDNA
(ds cDNA) with the following thermal profile: 1 min at
95°C followed by 19 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, 65°C for
30 sec, and 68°C for 6 min. And then, 5 μl of PCR product were electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel to determine the amplification efficiency and quality.
Approximately 13 μg of amplified ds cDNA was purified
using the PureLink ™ PCR purification kit (Invitrogen,
USA). Then the purified cDNA was treated with BsgI
(NEB, USA) overnight at 37°C and recovered by QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, USA). Finally, a
total of 10 μg of ds cDNA was used for pyrosequencing
with the GS FLX Titanium Kit.
454 EST assembly and annotation

The 454 raw read sequences were screened and
trimmed for weak signals by GS FLX pyrosequencing
software to yield high-quality (HQ) (> 99.5% accuracy of
single-base reads) sequences. The resulting HQ reads
were then submitted to the Short Read Archive at NCBI
and assigned the accession number SRX017444. The
primer and adapter sequences were trimmed from the
HQ sequences, followed by removing the sequences
shorter than 50 bp from the clean ESTs before assembly. Then, the data from the 454 read sequences were
assembled into unique sequences (including contigs and
singletons) using 454 GS De Novo Assembler software
v2.0.01.14 (454 Life Sciences, Roche) with a quality
score threshold set at 40.
The assembled unique sequences were first searched
for sequence similarities against the NCBI non-

redundant nucleotide (Nt) database using the BLASTN
algorithm with E-value cut-off of 10 -5 to find and
remove ribosomal RNA sequences [50]. And then, the
remaining sequences were searched against the public
databases including the Arabidopsis protein database at
The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR; http://
www.arabidopsis.org) (version Tair9), SwissProt protein
database (http://www.expasy.ch/sprot; released on 06/
19/2009), and the NCBI non-redundant protein (Nr)
database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov; released on 06/
23/2009) using the BLASTX algorithm with an E-value
cut-off of 10-5. The functional categories of these unique
sequences were further analyzed using the Gene Ontology (GO) database. The unique sequences were categorized according to GO terms based on AGI codes and
TAIR GO slim provided by TAIR.
Pathway assignment with KEGG database

Pathway assignments were carried out according to the
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) mapping (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/kegg2.html) (version KEGG 50) [33]. Enzyme commission (EC) numbers
were assigned to unique sequences after BLASTX
searches with an E-value cut-off of 10-5 upon against the
KEGG database. The unique sequences were assigned to
special biochemical pathways according to the corresponding EC distribution in the KEGG database.
Simple sequence repeat (SSR) detection

The total unique sequences were searched to determine
the composition, frequency, and distribution of simple
sequence repeats (SSRs) using an online SSR identification tool - SSRIT (Simple Sequence Repeat Identification Tool) (http://www.gramene.org/db/markers/ssrtool)
[51]. The search parameters for the maximum motiflength group were set to recognize hexamers and the
minimum number of repeats was set to five.
Screening of CYP450 or UGT unique sequences encoding
enzymes responsible for triterpene saponin biosynthesis

The DS transcript was much more abundant in P. notoginseng (1,018 reads), suggesting the other genes encoding enzymes in the same biosynthetic pathway were also
expressed at much higher levels in the former species.
For CYP450s and UGTs, each isozyme with more than
ten reads in P. notoginseng is arbitrarily considered a
candidate involved in the biosynthesis of triterpene
saponins. The screening of CYP450s and UGTs was performed according to phylogenetic analysis.
Production of full-length cDNA sequences for CYP450s

sequences. The 5’ or 3’ ends of cDNAs were amplified
using a SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech, USA) from total RNA of P. notoginseng root and
cloned into T easy Vector (Promega, USA) for Sanger
sequencing. Then the full-length cDNA of each gene
was generated by assembly of the corresponding EST
sequence and 5’ and/or 3’end sequences.
Phylogenetic analysis

Distances between each clone were calculated with
the CLUSTAL W program [52]. The indicated scale
represents 0.1 amino acid substitutions per site.
Amino acid sequences were aligned using the CLUSTAL W program and evolutionary distances were
computed using the Poisson correction method, and a
Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree was constructed with
MEGA4. Bootstrap values obtained after 1000 replications are given on the branches. Values less than 50%
are not shown.
