Abstract
Background: Foamy viruses are exogenous complex retroviruses that are highly endemic in
several animal species, including monkeys and apes, where they cause persistent infection. Simian
foamy viral (SFV) infection has been reported in few persons occupationally exposed to non-human
primates (NHP) in zoos, primate centers and laboratories, and recently in few hunters from central
Africa. Most of the epidemiological works performed among NHP populations concern crosssectional studies without long-term follow-up. Therefore, the exact timing and the modes of
transmission of SFVs remain not well known, although sexual and oral transmissions have been
suspected. We have conducted a longitudinal study in a free-breeding colony of Macaca tonkeana
in order (1) to determine the prevalence of the infection by foamy viruses, (2) to characterize
molecularly the viruses infecting such animals, (3) to study their genetic variability overtime by longterm follow-up of several DNA samples in a series of specific animals, and (4) to get new insights
concerning the timing and the modes of SFVs primary infection in these monkeys by combining
serology and molecular means, as well as studies of familial structures and long-term behavioral
observations.
Results/conclusion: We first demonstrated that this colony was highly endemic for SFVs, with a
clear increase of seroprevalence with age. Only 4.7% of immatures, and 43,7% of sub-adults were
found seropositive, while 89.5% of adults exhibited antibodies directed against SFV. We further
showed that 6 different strains of foamy viruses (exhibiting a very low intra-strain and overtime
genetic variability in the integrase gene) are circulating within this group. This suggests a possible
infection by different strains within an animal. Lastly, we provide strong evidence that foamy viruses
are mostly acquired through severe bites, mainly in sub-adults or young adults. Most cases of
seroconversion occur after 7 years of age; from this age individuals competed for access to sexual
partners, thus increasing the likelihood of being wounded. Furthermore, all the serological and
molecular data, obtained in this free-breeding colony, argue against a significant transmission of
SFVs from mother or father to infants as well as between siblings.

Background
Foamy viruses (FVs) are members of the Spumavirus genus
of the Retroviridae family [1]. These exogenous complex
retroviruses are highly prevalent in several animal species,
including primates, felines, bovines and equines where
they cause persistent infections [2-7]. Simian foamy viral
(SFV) infection has also been reported in 1 to 4 % of persons occupationally exposed to non-human primates in
zoos, primate centers and laboratories, mainly in Northern America but also in Europe [8-12]. Very recently, naturally acquired SFV infections have been described in few
hunters living in Cameroon, central Africa [13] (and
Calattini et al., in preparation) and in one person with frequent contacts with Macaca fascicularis in a temple in Bali,
Indonesia [14].
Foamy viruses are considered as non-pathogenic in naturally or experimentally infected animals [15,16]. Furthermore, they do not seem to cause any disease in the very
few humans who were accidentally infected, and who
have then beneficiated of a long-term medical and biological follow-up [9,11,12,17]. This lack of pathogenicity
contrasts strongly with the cytopathic effect that is seen in
vitro in infected cell cultures, with the appearance of
"foamy-like" syncitia [15,18,19].
In contrast to the HIV/SIV lentiviruses, foamy viruses
exhibit a very low genetic drift in vivo [2,20-22]. Phylogenetic analyses have also demonstrated a species-specific
distribution of foamy viruses. This indicates a long-term
co-evolution of such retroviruses with their natural hosts
[23]. Recently, Switzer et al. demonstrated that FVs might
have co-speciated with Old World primates for at least 30
million years [24]. Such features could explain their possible lack of pathogenicity that is observed in vivo and the
long-life persistence of the infection [4,20,21]. Worth noting is that the great majority of the viral strains yet characterized concerns African monkeys and Apes. Indeed,
relatively few data are known on the variability of FVs in
Asian monkeys, despite an important biodiversity of such
animals, especially within the macaques species
[8,24,25].
While the molecular features of foamy viruses have been
extensively studied in vitro [15,18,19,26], only few data
are available on the characteristics of FVs in vivo, including
epidemiological determinants [3,4,16,20-22]. As an
example, the timing and modes of primary infection are
not well known.
The few published epidemiological studies indicate that
among captive non human primate populations, antibodies seroprevalence to SFVs can reach up to 75–100% in
adults [4,16,20]. Furthermore, there is only one recent
study reporting the SFV seroprevalence in a free-ranging

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/23

group of non-human primates (NHPs) [14]. This study
concerns a group of 38 macaques living in Bali, Indonesia.
However, most studies are cross-sectional works in captive
animals and no long-term follow-up searching specifically for time and mode of seroconversion had been performed. Regarding the modes of infection, some studies
have shown that SFVs are present at a high concentration
in the saliva of infected animals [26-28] Throat mucosa
has been shown to be an important site for viral replication in African green monkeys [27], and a very recent
study demonstrated high levels of viral RNA in oral tissues
of macaques [28]. All together, this suggests that bites,
scratches and mucosal splashes can be mechanisms of
transmission, at least in some animals. Other studies in
captive colonies of baboons have suggested that sexual
and/or mother to offspring transmission through saliva
contacts can occurred [2,20].
We have conducted a study in a free-breeding colony of
Macaca tonkeana housed in the Strasbourg Primatology
Center in France. This colony was followed for more than
24 years for behavioral investigations including the study
of social relationships and reproductive behaviors [2934]. The goals of our current study were: 1) to determine
the prevalence of SFV infection in this colony, 2) to characterize the viruses that infect these animals and to study
their genetic variability overtime through a long-term follow-up, 3) to try to get new insights concerning the timing
and modes of foamy viruses primary infection in these
monkeys by combining serology and molecular means as
well as studies of familial structures and long-term behavioral observations.

Results
Seroprevalence of foamy virus infection among the
macaques colony
Fifty-six different animals (27 females and 29 males) were
studied and a total of 141 samples were obtained during
the longitudinal follow-up of these monkeys, which
began with 4 animals in 1991 and ended in 2004. Based
on their age at the moment of sampling, these animals
have been classified as immatures (0–4 years old), subadults (5–8 years), or adults (>8 years old). All plasma/
sera were tested with a western blot assay. The seroprevalence of the SFV among the M. tonkeana colony of the Primatology Center of Strasbourg is presented in Table 1.

We first performed a cross-sectional study analyzing only
the last sample obtained for each animal. Twenty-five out
of the 56 samples (44,6%) revealed a clear western blot
sero-reactivity when screened with a BHK-21 cell line
infected by a virus originating from a macaque (MtoT6) of
this colony. As seen in figure 1, the rate of FVs sero-positivity increased strongly with age. Indeed, only one out of
21 immatures (4.7%), and seven out of 16 sub-adults

for several days with regular passages and were examined
carefully for the appearance of a cytopathic effect. Giant
cell formation and syncitia were first observed for the T1
sample after 8 days of co-culture, while such CPE was only
detected after 12 days for the T6 and TF2 sample cells.
Concerning the T5 and TG1 cells, the appearance of syncitia and giant cells was delayed until 18 days of co-culture.
The destruction of the monolayer of BHK-21 was quite
rapid (2 to 4 days) after the first appearance of the CPE.
Regular adding of BHK-21 cells was thus necessary to sustain the culture.

Comparative seroprevalence rates for foamy virus
and HTLV-1/STLV-1 in the 56 animals of the colony.
According to age at the last sampling, animals were classified
in three groups corresponding to immatures (0–4 years old),
subadults (5–8 years old) and adults (more than 8 years old).
(43,7%) were found to be SFV seropositive, while 17 out
19 adults (89.5%) exhibited antibodies directed against
SFV. We then compared these data to the STLV-1/HTLV-1
serological results, obtained with the same samples. The
STLV-1/HTLV-1 seroprevalence rate was already very high
in the immatures animals (81%) and remained stable in
the sub-adults (68.7%) and adults (89.5%) (Figure 1).
Such results are consistent with the known modes of
transmission for STLV-1; mainly from mother to child
through breast-feeding.
In order to gain new insights on the timing of SFV infection, we undertook a longitudinal study with a long-term
follow-up of this colony. Forty-one animals were tested at
least twice. All of the 141 samples of the colony were
tested initially with a WB using as antigen the chimpanzee
foamy virus strain. Furthermore, all of the negative sera
with the chimpanzee strain were then tested with a WB
using antigens from the macaca foamy virus strain (BHK21 cells infected by MtoT6). With this "autologous" virus,
we found only one more positive sera (very faint seroreactivity -TN7) that was negative with the previously WB. As
seen in Table 2, fourteen animals (9 adults, 5 sub-adults,
and 1 immature) were found to be SFV seropositive at
their first sampling. Furthermore, 17 out of the 41 animals remained SFV seronegative during the study (most of
them being immatures or sub-adults), while 10 monkeys
seroconverted for SFV during the follow-up.
Virus isolation
Isolation of SFV was assayed on five animals (T1, T5, T6,
TF2 and TG1) whose WB showed a strong seropositivity.
After an initial stimulation with PHA for 2 days, the
PBMCs were cultured in presence of IL-2. Then, these
mononuclear cells were co-cultivated with BHK-21 cells

In order to search for foamy viral expression, IFA was performed, using a specific anti foamy sera, on the co-cultures showing a typical CPE. Syncitia and large cells
showed a strong and clear specific fluorescence (as shown
in figure 2A), while negative control cells and co-culture
without any CPE were totally negative by IFA (data not
shown).
Electron microscopy analyses performed on cultured cells
with a strong CPE demonstrated the presence of multinucleated giant cells. Typical foamy viral particles (of 100–
110 nm of diameter) were frequently observed, with several envelope spikes and a spherical central core (figure
2B). Budding of such viral particles was mainly observed
from membrane surface of the endoplasmic reticulum, as
known for such infection [19,35,36].
Molecular results
High molecular DNA was obtained from the peripheral
blood buffy-coat of 49 out the 56 animals with a total of
95 DNA samples obtained during the follow-up. Among
the 49 monkeys, there were 21 SFVs seropositive and 28

Apart from the 15 integrase positive samples obtained
from DNAs of the buffy-coat (Table 1), we also obtained
by PCR two other similar fragments from the cultured
cells of two FVs seropositive animals (T6 and TG1), whose
uncultured peripheral blood cells were found negative by
PCR.

seronegative animals respectively. In 7 monkeys, (including 4 SFV seropositive), buffy-coat was not available.
Nested polymerase chain reaction for the LTR and the integrase regions were performed on 49 DNAs corresponding
to the most recent obtained sample, from the 49 animals
(Table 1).
All the DNA samples (n = 29), originating from SFVs
seronegative monkeys, scored PCR negative. By contrast,
as seen in Table 1, 18 DNA samples, out the 21 SFVs seropositive animals, scored positive with the integrase and/or
LTR PCR. Only 4 DNA samples were found positive for
both nested PCR assays. To determine whether these discrepancies of results between the two PCR assays could be
related to a low viral load (reaching the limits of our PCR
sensibility), we used a semi-quantitative PCR. Fifteen out
of the 18 positive monkeys had a very low viral load, ranging from 1 to 10 copies in 500 ng of total DNA. In only
three cases (two of them being positive for both nested
PCRs), the SF viral load reached 100 copies in 500 ng of
total DNA (figure 3 and Table 1).

Genetic variability of foamy viruses
Overall genetic variability
The 17 samples, found integrase positive, were cloned and
one clone for each of them was sequenced. Genetic comparison of these 17 new SFVs strains between themselves
showed that 14 belonged to 3 main molecular groups
(that we called TMA, TMB, TMC). In addition, 3
sequences that we called TMD, TME and TMF, did not
belong to these 3 groups. As seen in Table 3, the strains
originating from TQ3, TD3, T1, TG2 and TG3 (TMA
group) were nearly identical to each other (99.5 to 100%
at the nucleotide level) as were the three sequences from
T4, T7 and TF2 (TMB group) that exhibited 99.5 to 100%
similarity. Furthermore, the six sequences from TI4, T5,
TK3, T6, TG1, and TM3 (TMC group) were also nearly
identical (99.7 to 100%). Finally, the three last sequences
originating from Z10 (TMD), T2 (TME) and TD1 (TMF)
were different to each other, as well as to the 14 other ones
(Table 3). Thus, members of this colony of Macaca
tonkeana were infected by 6 different strains of SFVs.
Divergences ranged from 5.5% to 17.4% at a nucleotide
level between these genetic clusters.

To confirm these results, we decided to analyse also the
LTR of these SFVs. However, as the length of the LTR fragment amplified in our study is too small (109 bp) for reliable phylogenetic analyses, we decided to amplify our
DNA samples using the LTR primers described by Engel et
al [14], which generate a 336 bp fragment. Thirteen out of
the 18 PCR positive (for integrase and/or LTR regions)
showed a positive result. We found a perfect concordance
for all the strains with the same molecular groups as previously identified using the integrase sequences: MtoT1,
MtoTG2, MtoTG3, MtoTQ3 and MtoTD3 form a group
(the TMA group), MtoTK3, MtoTG1, MtoT6 and MtoT5
form another group (the TMC group) and finally MtoTF2
and MtoT7 form the TMB group (data not shown).
Genetic comparison of the 17 new 425 bp integrase
sequences with all the other available SFVs integrase
sequences indicated that they exhibited from 62,1% to
95,8% of similarity at the nucleotide level with the different other SFVs strains. As seen in Table 3, it is worthwhile
to note that the only 11 available integrase genes from
other macaque species (including the prototypes
MmuSFV1b, McySFV2, MmuSFVmac) were neither identical, nor very closely related (4.2% to 16.7% of nucleotide

Phylogenetic tree generated on a 425 bp fragment of the integrase FV gene
Phylogenetic tree generated on a 425 bp fragment of the integrase FV gene. The tree includes all of the 17 new
macaca tonkeana FV described in this study and other FV sequences from African and Asian apes and monkeys available in GenBank. The phylogeny was generated with the Neighbor-joining method, performed in the PAUP program (v4.0b10). The
sequence alignment was submitted to the Modeltest program (version 3.6) to select the best model to apply to phylogenetic
analyses. The selected model was the GTR+G+I one. The reliability of the inferred tree was evaluated by bootstrap analysis on
1000 replicates. Numbers at each node indicate the percentage of bootstrap samples in which the cluster to the right is supported and only values greater than 60% are shown. The branch lengths are drawn to scale with the bar indicating 0.1 nucleotide replacement per site. The tree was rooted by using the New World spider monkey Asp(SFV8spm) sequence. *= SFVpfr:

divergence) to the new sequences from M. tonkeana,
obtained in this study.
Intra-strain genetic variability
To look for the intra-strain genetic variability of such SFVs
in vivo, we sequenced 10 clones of the integrase gene fragment obtained from a PCR performed with 2 different
DNA samples (Z10 and TQ3). The results showed 3 and 5
mutations respectively for the 2 series of 10 clones, indicating a very low intra-strain genetic variability (8/8500 =
1°/°°).
Overtime genetic variability
To gain new insights into the overtime genetic variability
of such SFVs in a same individual, we amplified by PCR 17
DNA samples originating from 7 animals followed with a
mean time of 6 years and 5 months (range 2 to 12 years).
One clone was sequenced for each integrase PCR sample.
In 4 cases, the sequences of the integrase gene fragment of
425 bp were totally identical, while in the 3 other monkeys, only one base (in two cases) and 4 bases (in one
case) were observed in samples originating from the same
animal.
Phylogenetic analyses
A comprehensive phylogenetic study was performed with
the Neighbor-Joining method using the 17 novel SFVs
sequences generated in this study, and all 11 other integrase gene fragments from Asian monkeys, available in
GenBank. We also included in this analysis 31 prototypes
of SFVs from Asian and African apes and from African
monkeys. The strain ApsSFV8spm originating from a
South American spider monkey was used as out-group to
root the tree.

As seen in figure 4, there are three main SFVs clusters. The
first one comprising the sequences from Apes, the second
one corresponding to the sequences from the African
monkeys and the third one comprising all the sequences
from Asian monkeys. As expected, the 17 novel sequences
from M. tonkeana, generated in this study, were clearly
located within the large and highly phylogenetically supported Asian clade (99% bootstrap value). Within this
Asian group, two main groups supported by high bootstrap values could be identified. The first one (TMC-bootstrap of 100%) corresponds to a group of 6 new sequences
from M. tonkeana. The second group (bootstrap of 98%)
comprised all the other 22 Asian SFVs sequences. Within
this second clade, several sub-clusters that are highly supported phylogenetically (bootstrap of 73–100%) could be
identified and two of them comprised only M. tonkeana
sequences (these two groups are TMA and TMB).

Modes of transmission of SFVs in this colony
Very little evidence of SFVs transmission from mother to child and
between siblings
Based on serological findings, there is only very little evidence for a mother to child transmission of SFVs. Indeed,
in this series, all but one of the 21 immatures, were seronegative for foamy viruses at their first sample and
remained negative until at least 3 years, despite the fact
that their mother was infected in all but two cases, when
she gave birth to each of them. This contrasts sharply with
the situation for STLV-1. Indeed, in this case, most of the
immatures are infected by STLV-1 (probably through
breast-feeding) at their first sample and the only STLV-1
seronegative immature had an STLV-1 seronegative
mother.

When considering the molecular results, 8 out 11 mother
and child infected pairs are infected by different viral
strains. Furthermore, none of the 7 pairs of infected siblings harbored a similar virus between themselves. Furthermore, regarding father to child transmission, it is
interesting to note that among the 7 children of T1 (verified by genetic exclusion of paternity), 3 different strains
of SFVs are present. All these data argue against a significant transmission of simian foamy viruses from mother or
father to child as well as between siblings.
Evidence for acquisition of SFVs infection during severe bites, mainly
in sub-adults or young adults
On a serological point of view, it is worth noting that the
SFV seroconversion followed the first documented important episode of severe bite (with a dermal wound) in 7 out
of 10 animals. For example, in case of T9, we observed a
seroconversion between 1991 and 1993 and the first
severe injury was registered in 1992. Furthermore, for
TG1, the seroconversion was observed between 1996 and
2002 and the first important injury was declared in 1998.

On a molecular point of view, the situation is less clear,
especially because it is very difficult in the case of a severe
wound to know exactly whose animal is responsible for
the bite. However, one case is particularly informative:
during the year 2003, TD3 and TG2 had frequent conflicts
and TD3 received severe bites. TD3 was negative in 2002
and was found to be positive in 2004. Interestingly, TD3
was infected by the TMA strain identical to that found in
TG2 in 2002.

Discussion
Our findings on the FV prevalence confirmed that captive
colonies of non-human primates are often highly
endemic for foamy viruses [4,16,20]. In fact, in our study,
nearly half of the animals (and 89% of the adults) are
infected by FVs. Furthermore, for the first time, we

Page 10 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

Retrovirology 2006, 3:23

extended herein to M. tonkeana species the presence of
such high levels of FVs infection.
It is important to note that our study took place in a quite
large, free-breeding colony, which is not the case in most
of the few other studies performed for FVs in NHP captive
colonies [2,4,8,20,22]. Moreover, some of the published
studies have been performed in colonies comprising different species of monkeys. For instance, in a captive US
colony of 254 baboons, including 150 adults and 104
juvenile, 88% (132/150) of the adults were FVs seropositive. However, this colony comprised at least 3 different
subspecies of baboon (Papio ursinus, P. anubis and P. cynocephalus) of different origins, with some animals having
been recently captured in East Africa, while most of the
other baboons were long time residents of the captive colony (5 to >15 years). Furthermore, in this group, most of
the young animals were removed from the breeding
harem at 6–9 months of age, therefore reducing the
opportunities of being infected by FVs [2,28]. In another
US colony of baboons, all the 38 adults, housed in gang
cages, were found FVs seropositive while all but one of the
10 juveniles, were found seronegative. However, in this
work too, the juveniles were not housed in most of the
cases with their mothers, having been removed from them
shortly after birth [20].
Regarding specifically Asian monkeys, a survey of a colony
of M. fascicularis, held at Health Canada (Ottawa), and all
bred from wild-caught animals, indicated that 80% of the
395 animals were infected by SFVs [8]. Verschoor et al.,
found also that 69.4% of 108 orangutan blood samples
originating from a reintroduction center in East Kalimatan
were found seropositive for FVs [37]. Lastly, only one
study recently published has been performed in a freeranging colony of monkeys, i. e. a group of 38 macaques
(mostly adults) living in a temple in Central Bali, Indonesia. In this case, the seroprevalence for FVs was of 89.5%,
reaching 93% in adults [14].
In our study, we have also analyzed the presence of FVs
proviral DNA in the peripheral blood buffy-coat DNA of
most of the studied animals. The PCR negativity obtained
in some animals with a clear positive WB, was probably
linked to a very low viral load in the peripheral blood
buffy-coat (< than 1–10 copies in 500 ng DNA, i.e. 75 000
cells). Moreover, we can strongly suggest here that the
negativity of PCR is not due to the presence of divergent
foamy viruses, but to a low viral load. Indeed, in two animals, T6 and TG1, for which the integrase PCR was negative in the uncultured PBMCs, we were able to amplify the
same integrase fragment on cultured cells. Up to know, little is known about the FVs proviral load in naturally
infected NHPs [28]. In a study of African green monkeys,
a very low proviral load was detected in most tissues and

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/23

very recently, a report described that SFV DNA was present
at a low copy number in PBMCs and tissue from
macaques [27,28]. Previously, we found, using a similar
semi-quantitative technique, a low proviral load ranging
from 1 to 100 copies for 500 ng of peripheral blood buffycoat DNA, in a series of wild-caught chimpanzees [38].
Furthermore, such lack of detection of FVs sequences has
also been reported in the PBMCs DNA of several hunters,
living in remote villages of South Cameroon, who where
found to exhibit a clear FV WB seroreactivity with the presence of the gag doublet [13].
Analysis of the foamy viral sequences found in the 17
monkeys, for which the integrase gene could be amplified,
indicates clearly the presence of 6 different groups of FVs
strains in this colony of M. Tonkeana. This colony has been
carefully followed for more than 24 years for behavioral
investigations. Furthermore, these animals have never
been in contact with any other monkeys since their arrival
in France in 1972 and they have neither been used in any
biomedical experiments, nor injected with any biological
materials [39]. Keepers did not manipulate animals from
different species of the center with the same gloves. Crossspecies transmission in the primatology center was thus
very unlikely, but of course, it cannot be ruled out with
100% certainty. Thus, the viruses currently present in this
colony should have been present originally in some of the
founders of the colony. As all the members of this troop
originated from only 5 different animals, this means that
some of these monkeys (or at least one) should have
been, at a given time, infected by more than one foamy
viral strain. These different viruses were subsequently disseminated by natural means in other animals of the colony.
Concerning the possibility that the Tonkean macaques
may have become infected, prior to arrival at the primate
center, with SFVs from other primates species which they
are sympatric with, within Sulawesi, it is important to
note that the seven different taxa (species or subspecies,
according to the different current classifications) of
macaques present in Sulawesi are allopatric, which
exclude any transmission between two different species in
a given region [40]. However, the exact geographical origin of some of the founders is not known with great precision within Sulawesi Island (central or peripheral region
of the distribution area of the M. Tonkeana). Thus, we cannot totally exclude a contamination in the wild (prior to
the arrival in the primatology center) of some of the
founders with a foamy viral strain originating from a
related species or subspecies.
By using classical nested PCR methods for the integrase
gene, as previously described, we did not find in any of the
studied animals, a clear evidence for multiple infections

by different foamy viruses. This is based on the following
arguments: 1) We always found the same strain in the
molecular follow-up of a specific given animal overtime
and this even after 12 years of in vivo evolution. 2) In two
animals, we sequenced ten clones of a PCR experiment
and only one strain was amplified for a given animal. 3)
The viruses isolated after cultures of PBMCs were identical
to that found in the uncultured PBMCs of the monkeys.
However, search for multiple infections in these animals
are ongoing, using very sensitive PCR methods as previously described [41].
The presence of different strains of FVs in a colony, as
found in the M. tonkeana troop, is not without precedent.
Indeed, Schweizer et al. found in a troop of 19 African
green monkeys (originating from Kenya), and living
together in a monkey house, four different FVs clusters
with high homologies (>95%) in the envelope surface
domain gene [22]. Between the clusters, the divergences
ranged from 3 to 25%, indicating thus that four different
strains or subtypes of simian FVs were prevalent in this
colony. In another study, Blewett et al., have shown the
presence of 2 different FVs (based on pol and LTR
sequences) in a colony of baboons [2]. However, these
two distinct clades consisted of isolates from yellow and
olive baboon and isolates from chacma baboons respectively. Very recently, Jones-Engel et al., found in M.
tonkeana the presence of at least 4 different strains of FVs
[14]. This observation was based on the analysis of a small
fragment of the LTR and some of the observed clades were
not clearly supported phylogenetically (low bootstrap values).
The exact modes and timing of SFV transmission in monkeys is unknown although both sexual and oral transmission have been suspected [20,27]. Furthermore, it is rather
difficult to compare our results with those of the very few
other published studies with a follow-up as they were performed, as seen above, in different kinds of colony with
sometimes the immatures being removed from their
mother, either shortly after birth or after few months [2].
Moreover, modes and timing of infection for a specific
virus can vary according to the different behaviors of different monkey or apes species studied, as well demonstrated in the case of STLV-1 [42-44]. Here, the possibility
to study a free-breeding colony of monkeys with longterm follow-up with both plasma and DNA sequential
samples and behavioral investigations provide us a
unique work opportunity.
We provided here serological and molecular data arguing
against a significant transmission of simian foamy viruses
from mother or father to child as well as between siblings.

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/23

Concerning a possible sexual acquisition of SFV, it is interesting to note that the seroconversion timing of SFVs
strongly contrasted with that found for the herpes B virus,
whose primary mode of infection is sexual contact [45]. In
this colony of M. tonkeana, most males become positive
for herpes B between 2.5 and 6 years of age because they
may early start to mount adult females (outside their fertility period), whereas females seroconverted only after
puberty, i.e. from 5 years of age (unpublished data from
Strasbourg Primatology Center). With regards to foamy
viruses, a majority of individuals remained negative until
7 years of age making thus improbable, mounts as a possible way of transmission.
Most cases of seroconversion for foamy viruses occurred
when individuals reached adulthood, a period of life that
entails an increased likelihood of biting. After 7 years of
age, for instance, males entered in competition for access
to oestrous females and they occasionally received
wounds from their rivals [40]. Indeed, it is clear that in
this colony, SFVs seroconversion followed the first important recorded episode of severe bite (with a dermal
wound) in 7 out of 10 animals. Concerning the molecular
point of view, it is very difficult in case of a severe wound
to know exactly who is the animal responsible for the bite.
However, in our colony, we can demonstrate the direct
transmission of a specific FV strain from a positive to a
seronegative animal after an episode of severe bites. All
together, these data suggest strongly natural transmission
of SFVs via severe bites with contact of saliva from the
infected animal to the blood strain of the recipient. However, as viral loads have been shown to be very important
determinants for transmission of other primate retroviruses, more conclusive evidence for SFVs transmission
routes in primates will require determination of viral
loads in different body fluids such as saliva, semen, vaginal lavages and breast milk.
Our findings fit very well with studies demonstrating that
SFVs are present in the saliva of infected macaques and
baboons [2,28] and that oral tissues are important site for
FV replication in African green monkeys and macaques
[27]. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that most of the
SFV infections, reported in persons occupationally
exposed to non-human primates in zoos or primates centers, have probably been acquired through bites [812,14,46]. Very recently, natural acquired SFV infections
have also been found in few hunters in Cameroon, central
Africa [13] and in an ongoing study, we could demonstrated that bites from a monkey or an ape is, in central
Africa, a major risk factor for acquiring such SFV infection
([47] and Calattini et al., in preparation).

Methods
Animals
A Macaca tonkeana captive colony, housed in the Strasbourg Primatology Center, was investigated for the presence of simian foamy viral infection. This colony was
established originally from 7 animals, all originating from
the central part of Sulawesi (Indonesia) and brought to
the Strasbourg center in 1972. From 1972 to 1978, these
animals were housed together. Only one (MtoT2) of the
seven founders was still alive when we began this work
more than twelve years ago. In 1978, the colony was separated in two groups, the first comprising only 3 animals,
which constituted the original nucleus (or founders) of
the current studied colony. Lastly, two animals from the
second group were incorporated in the colony; one in
1981 (MtoT10) and one in 2002 (MtoZ10). Since then,
the progeny has been maintained in large wooded enclosure at the primatology center. The animals have been
carefully followed for behavioral investigations for 24
years. During this long period of follow-up, animals were
visited every day by an ethologist who controls the animal
status and especially the presence or absence of wounds or
bleedings. Furthermore, the animals were never in contact
with other monkey species and were never used in biomedical experiments, nor infected with any biological
material [34,39].
Serological tests
All plasma samples were first analyzed to investigate the
presence of FVs antibodies as previously described
[4,5,48]. Briefly, a Western Blot (WB) assay was performed using, as a source of foamy viral antigens, a BHK21 cell line infected with a chimpanzee SFV strain. Plasma
were tested at 1:100 dilution. WB seropositivity was
defined as the presence of a clear reactivity to the Gag doublet of 70 and 74 KDa. To validate our results obtained
with a chimpanzee antigen, we also tested a large subset
of samples with a WB using, as viral antigen, a lysate of
BHK-21 cells infected by the MtoT6 virus, which originated from a monkey of the M. Tonkeana colony. The WB
conditions were the same as previously described.
Virus isolation
Virus isolation was done in animals showing a strong WB
seropositivity, as previously described [5,7,11,35]. Briefly,
BHK-21 cells were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 5% of fetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics.
Fresh blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes and
PBMCs (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells) were isolated on Ficoll-Hypaque gradient. PBMCs were then
maintained for 2 days in RPMI medium containing 20%
FCS, antibiotics and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) at 3 μg/
ml and further stimulated with IL-2 (100U/ml). After 4
days of stimulation, PBMCs were co-cultivated with BHK-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/23

21 cells. Cultures were checked daily for syncytial cytopathic effect (CPE) typical of FV infection.
For transmission electron microscopy, cells were fixed in
2.5% glutaraldehyde and 1% paraformaldehyde in 0.15
M cacodylate buffer complemented with MgCl2, CaCl2
and sucrose at 0.1 M. After 2 days at 4°C, the filters were
washed during 2 hours in cacodylate buffer and treated
with 1% of osmium teroxide solution and 1% potassium
ferrocyanide for 1 hour at room temperature. Cells were
dehydrated in ethanol and included in an epoxy resin at
60°C for 48 hrs. Ultrathin sections were performed on a
microtome Leica ultracut UCT. Sections were then examined in a Jeol 1200 EX electron microscope.
Indirect immunofluorescence
An indirect IF assay was performed on co-cultivated cells
at 7 and 21 days post- infection. The primary antibody of
the reaction was a serum derived from a rabbit experimentally infected with a chimpanzee SFV strain; the secondary
antibody was a fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
diluted 1:500. Cells were then mounted with DAPI-containing mounting medium and visualized with a Zeiss
Axioplan 2 imaging microscope X40 using a Zeiss Axiocam Hrc (color) camera and the Zeiss Apotome software.
For each reaction, a negative and positive control was
added. The positive control corresponded to BHK-21 cells
infected with a chimpanzee SFV strain [36], while the negative control consisted of uninfected BHK-21 cells.
Molecular studies
High molecular weight genomic DNA was extracted from
the buffy-coat of the studied animals and of several positive and negative controls using the Qiagen kit (QIAmp
blood Mini Kit, Courtaboeuf, France). Two SFV proviral
genomic regions (a 425 bp fragment of the integrase gene
and a 109 bp fragment of the LTR) were studied using
generic, nested primers as previously reported [5,21]. The
presence and quality of the extracted DNA were verified by
amplifying a ß-globin gene fragment.

In order to calculate the sensitivity of the two nested
assays, DNA was extracted from a cell line (HFV-2) containing 2 copies of integrated foamy virus genome and
then amplified with a semi-quantitative PCR. The sensitivity of our tests ranged from one to 10 copies detected in
500 ng (75 000 cells) of cellular DNA. We estimated the
viral load in samples that showed a positive result after the
qualitative PCR assay. Thus, we performed a semi-quantitative PCR by amplifying six 10-fold serial dilutions of the
DNA ranging from 500 ng to 0,5 pg. The PCR conditions
and the cycling were performed as previously described
[4,21]. Each sample was amplified separately for the ßglobin gene and for the viral target. The quantification of
the viral load was expressed as the number of viral

genome in 500 ng of total DNA (i.e. 75000 cells). Integrase
PCR products were purified, cloned in a pCR vector and
sequenced using the BigDye terminator cycle kit and an
ABI 3100 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystem). The
17 new integrase gene fragments sequences of simian
foamy viruses determined herein were deposited in the
National Center for Biotechnology Information database.
The GenBank accession numbers are DQ354073 to
DQ354089.
Phylogenetic analyses
Multiple nucleotide sequences alignment was performed
with the DAMBE program on the basis of a previous
amino-acid alignment created from the original
sequences. The final alignment was submitted to the
Model Test program to select the best phylogenetical
model to apply for the phylogentical analyses. The best
phylogenetical model, selected using Model Test was the
GTR+I+G model (-lnL= 6502.5806) with a shape of
0.9959 and a pinvar of 0.2901. The phylogeny was
derived by the Neighbour-Joining method (with a bootstrap value of 1000), performed in Paup program [49,50].
HTLV-1/STLV-1 serology
All sera or plasma were tested for STLV-1 antibodies by an
immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with HTLV-1 (MT2) or
HTLV-2 (C19) producing cell lines, as previously
described [32]. Furthermore, all samples were tested by a
Western Blot, which contains disrupted HTLV-1, a recombinant protein (RGD21) that reacts with both HTLV-1 and
HTLV-2 antibodies and the two gp46 peptides MTA1 and
K55 [32].
