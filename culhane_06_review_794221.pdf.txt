Book details

Biological Science and Medicine Second edition. CRC Press,
Taylor & Francis Group, USA; 2005. 360 Pages, ISBN 0-84931283-3 (Hardcover)

I was excited to receive the second edition of this book for
review. The first edition published in 2000 received good
reviews on Amazon (four stars based on 5 reviews). Hence
I had expected a book which provided a broad introduction to bioinformatics as applied to biology and medicine; however I regret to say I was disappointed.
This book is divided into 5 chapters. The first chapter
'Biology and Information' begins with an interesting but
lengthy and somewhat unfocused introduction to the
application of computers in biology and medicine. This is
followed by a useful and concise section in basic DNA and
protein biochemistry, structure and function.
Databases are central to bioinformatics and chapter 2 on
'Biological Databases' should have provided a useful
resource to novices to the field, however this chapter has
been haphazardly updated from the first edition. Many
details in this chapter are out of date. For example, we are
told that "the basic BLAST program does not allow gaps in
its alignment" and that the executables for the "new" version of BLAST are available for "IRIX 6.2, Solaris 2.5, DEC
OSF1 and Win 32 operating systems." This was correct in
1997 (BLAST version 2.0), but is no longer correct and
should have been updated. In other instances statistics on
the number of entries in a database are given, however a
date or release version is not provided, thus making this

information meaningless. This chapter is structured
around a description of the web resources provide by the
large bioinformatic institutes (NCBI, EBI). This results in
a chapter with poor layout and repetition. For example,
interpretation of the BLAST E-value statistic is described
twice. This layout is unsatisfactory also as it tends to focus
on older databases ignoring valuable recent resources. It is
a pity that the authors did not direct the reader to the
annual Nucleic Acids Research Database and Web Server
issues. Major themes central to Bioinformatics such as
multiple alignment and phylogenetic tree analysis are
poorly addressed. This section briefly mentions ClustalW
and directs the reader to the NCBI databases of orthologous genes, Homologene and PFAM. With increasing
numbers of complete genomes available, a more comprehensive introduction to phylogenetic analysis and comparative genomics would be valuable.
A highlight of the book is the well written and informative
section on microarrays which was contributed by
Thorsten Forster and Peter Ghazal in Chapter 3. Unfortunately this did not include examples of applications of
microarrays to biological science or medicine. Chapter 4
which focuses on proteome analysis contained sections
on 2D gels, protein-protein interaction data, protein structure (PDB) and homology modeling of protein structure.
The latter focused almost exclusively commercial software
from Accelrys. A large proportion of this chapter (30
pages) was devoted to a detailed description of analytical
ultracentrifugation and hydrodynamics. Although this
was interesting, the depth of this section may have beyond
the scope of this book. Chapter 5 which promised to proPage 1 of 2

vide an overview of applications of bioinformatics was
brief (19 pages) and general.
As this book is entitled Bioinformatics Basics: Applications in Biological Science and Medicine, I expected this
book to provide a solid foundation in basic bioinformatics, together with interesting case studies where bioinformatics has been applied. Whilst this book may have filled
in niche in 2000 when few books were available, numerous publications which provide good introductions to
bioinformatics are now available. This book provides an
easy introduction but the careless editing of the second
version of this book maybe distracting to the readership of
Biomedical Engineering Online.
