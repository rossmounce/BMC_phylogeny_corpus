Genetic differentiation between cave and surfacedwelling populations of Garra barreimiae
(Cyprinidae) in Oman
Luise Kruckenhauser1*, Elisabeth Haring1, Robert Seemann2 and Helmut Sattmann3

Abstract
Background: Phenotypic similarities among cave-dwelling animals displaying troglomorphic characters (e.g.
reduced eyes and lack of pigmentation) have induced a long-term discussion about the forces driving convergent
evolution. Here we introduce Garra barreimiae Fowler & Steinitz, 1956, as an interesting system to study the
evolution of troglomorphic characters. The only hitherto known troglomorphic population of this species lives in Al
Hoota Cave (Sultanate of Oman) close to a surface population. As a first approach, we assessed the genetic
differentiation between the two morphotypes of G. barreimiae to determine whether gene flow still occurs.
Results: We analysed the mitochondrial control region (CR). In G. barreimiae the CR starts immediately downstream
of the tRNA-Thr gene, while the tRNA-Pro gene is missing at this genomic location. Interestingly, a putative tRNAPro sequence is found within the CR. The phylogenetic analyses of the CR sequences yielded a tree divided into
three clades: Clade 1 has a high genetic distance to the other clades and contains the individuals of three
populations which are separated by a watershed from all the others. Clade 2 comprises the individuals from Wadi
Bani Khalid, the geographically most remote population. Clade 3 comprises all other populations investigated
including that of Al Hoota Cave. The latter forms a haplogroup which also includes individuals from the adjacent
surface population.
Conclusions: Our data indicates that the troglomorphic cave population is of quite recent origin supporting the
hypothesis that selection drives the fast evolution of troglomorphic traits. In this context pleiotropic effects might
play an important role as it has been shown for Astyanax. There seems to be some gene flow from the cave
population into the adjacent surface populations. One blind individual, found at a surface locality geographically
distinct from Al Hoota Cave, is genetically differentiated from the other blind specimens indicating the probable
existence of another cave population of G. barreimiae. The phylogeographic analyses show that while some of the
surface populations are either still in contact or have been until recently, the population Wadi Bani Khalid is
genetically separated. One group consisting of three populations is genetically highly differentiated questioning
the conspecifity with G. barreimiae.

Background
Troglomorphic forms of animals have fascinated
humans ever since the first cave-dwelling animals were
discovered [1,2]. The most striking features of many troglobionts are the reduction of eyes and of surficial pigmentation [3]. The discussion about the forces driving
convergent evolution of reduced eyes and loss of

pigmentation in typical cave-living animals was initiated
very early in the history of evolutionary theory [4]. In
general, two competing hypotheses have been proposed
[5]: i) The lack of selective constraints leads to degeneration due to accumulation of mutations which are
fixed by genetic drift. ii) The troglomorphic traits provide selective advantages. The latter explanation includes
speculations on how reduced eyes would be advantageous, e.g., no infectious diseases of the eyes or energetic economy [6]. Pleiotropic effects have also been
discussed, i.e. that the same genes are involved in eye

development and in the formation of other constructive
traits (e.g., taste bud and forebrain development [7-10]).
To date about 86 troglomorphic fish species from 18
different families have been described [1], displaying various degrees of troglomorphism. There are, however,
also some cave-living fishes without troglomorphic phenotype [11]. Most studies conducted on cave fishes were
carried out on species of the genus Astyanax, which
became model organisms for investigating many different aspects of the development of troglomorphic characters (for a review see [5]). The data suggest that eye loss
in Astyanax is mainly driven by natural selection; the
loss of pigmentation seems more likely to be due to the
accumulation of neutral mutations [5]. Nevertheless,
convergent evolution of various troglomorphic species
might be driven by different evolutionary mechanisms.
Thus, investigating other species groups is important.
Here, we introduce another interesting system to
study the evolution of troglomorphic populations. Garra
barreimiae Fowler & Steinitz, 1956 is a fish species
endemic in the southeastern Arabian Peninsula; it is
listed as vulnerable by the IUCN 2010 (IUCN Red List
of Threatened Species. Version 2010.4.). Surface populations of this species with well developed eyes and proper
pigmentation are common in ponds and rivulets of the
Hajar Mountains [12,13]. In 1980, however, A. Dunsire
and M. Gallagher discovered one hypogean, troglomorphic population [14]. These eyeless and unpigmented fish were assigned to the same species as the surface
populations, because besides the troglomorphic traits no
further striking morphological differences were detected
[14]. The juveniles of the eyeless form display eyes
which become reduced during the growth to the adult
stage [14,15]. Hence, the adults have no externally visible eyes, and the optic lobes are not fully developed
[14]. Furthermore they have a weak squamation [9], a
trait that is defined by a reduced number and size of
scales [16].
The geographic coordinates of Dunsire’s finding (23
05 N, 57 21 E) coincide with the Al Hoota Cave System
near Al Hamra. Thus, this locality represents the only
hitherto known troglomorphic population of G. barreimiae [12,13]. Al Hoota Cave System has connected subterraneous lakes and is situated in the Ad Dakhliyyah
Region in the Western Al Hajar Mountains (Al Hajar Al
Gharbi) northwest of the town Nizwa and east of Al
Hamra (Figure 1). The Al Hoota population of blind
fish lives very close to a surface population in the same
natural drainage system. It is unknown to what degree
the development of functional eyes in G. barreimiae is
genetically determined or whether it might be induced
by environmental factors. An indication of a potential
influence of light was reported by [14]: Individuals originating from the cave population, which were raised in

Page 2 of 15

aquaria and exposed to light, showed a somewhat
increased level of melanin production and development
of the optic lobes (compared to individuals from the
cave dissected immediately after capture).
When trying to understand the evolution of troglomorphic forms it is crucial to consider the time frames
in which these populations separate from surface populations. In some of the populations of Astyanax and
Sinocyclocheilus the split between the troglomorphic and
the adjacent surface populations occurred quite recently
[17-19], while in others the lineages apparently diverged
long ago [18,19].
As a first approach we want to assess the genetic differentiation between the two morphotypes of G. barreimiae and determine whether gene flow presently occurs.
Lack of gene flow would favour the hypothesis that the
developmental differences are mainly genetically determined. The aim of the study was to analyse the phylogenetic relationships of cave and surface fish populations,
particularly from Al Hoota Cave and from adjacent
areas. Furthermore, the comprehensive phylogeographic
analysis of the species required inclusion more distant
localities in the Sultanate of Oman (Figure 1).

Results
Sequence analysis of the control region (CR)

To determine the part of the CR with the highest
amount of variability we analysed a 1364 bp section of
the mitochondrial DNA including the whole CR from
five individuals. This analysis revealed an unexpected
gene order upstream of the CR. In most fish species
analysed so far the tRNA genes for Threonine and Proline (tRNA-Thr and tRNA-Pro) are located between the
cytochrome b gene and the CR. Thus, both genes usually
provide good primer binding sites for the amplification
of the CR (in combination with primers binding downstream of the CR, in the tRNA-Phe or the 12rRNA
gene). In G. barreimiae, however, the CR starts immediately after the tRNA-Thr, while tRNA-Pro is missing at
this genomic location. Interestingly, a putative tRNA-Pro
(72 bp) sequence is found within the CR, 254 bp
upstream of the 3’-end. This sequence contains the
anticodon (tgg) and complementary sections stabilizing
the cloverleaf structure as expected for a functional
tRNA-Pro. The putative tRNA-Pro gene has an antiparallel orientation as has been described for other vertebrates and the sequence identity to the tRNA-Pro gene
of Cyprinus carpio [20] is about 80%. Exchange of the
positions of tRNA genes has been reported for many
animal species (e.g., [21-23] and references therein) and
seems to be the most common form of rearrangements
of mitochondrial genomes. In fish the first report of
tRNA rearrangements was for Gonostoma gracile (Teleostei: Stomiiformes; [24]) followed by similar

observations in numerous fish species (e.g., [25] and
references therein). To date, however, translocation of a
tRNA gene into the non-coding CR has not been
reported.
Due to the low quality of the DNA from some specimens we had to use a rather short fragment to obtain
the DNA sequence of as many individuals as possible.
The comparison of the five complete CR sequences
showed that the variation in the 5’-section was similar
to that in the 3’-section. For the 5’-part of the CR the
primer binding was more efficient, and this fragment
(CR1: 440 bp) was therefore chosen for the population
analyses (length of the alignment 400 bp). DNA was
extracted from 213 specimens of the genus Garra
(including five G. rufa as outgroup)and the CR1 was
successfully amplified from 150 individuals (145 G. barreimiae, five G. rufa). From each of the resulting haplogroups we chose several specimens to sequence an
additional overlapping 545 bp fragment (CR2) to obtain
information from a longer sequence (CR1+CR2; length
of alignment 861 bp). The sequence of CR1 and CR2
was determined from a total of 33 individuals (32 G.
barreimiae, one G. rufa).
Phylogenetic analyses

The analyses of the CR1 region resulted in the BI and
NJ trees shown in Figure 2a and 2b. The two trees do
not differ in their topology with one exception: One
clade in the NJ tree (supported by high bootstrap values)
decays in the BI analyses and appears in a ladderized
manner. This may be an artefact of the BI analysis due
to the short length of the sequences. The other two
main clades are highly supported in both trees. In the
following we refer to these three groups as clades. Clade
1 comprises three subclades, (1) nine individuals from
Wadi Bani Awf (two distinct localities), (2) six individuals from Wadi Hat which is located in Al Hajar Al
Gharbi, and (3) three individuals from Wadi Mansah
located in the region between Al Hajar Al Gharbi and
Al Hajar Ash Sharqi (Figure 1a). The latter subclade is
the sister group of the former two. All individuals from
Wadi Bani Awf share the same haplotype, which is very
similar to the single haplotype of the Wadi Hat individuals. All populations of clade 1 are located at the
northern side of the Al Jabal al Akhdar mountain range.
Clade 2 comprises the individuals from Wadi Bani Khalid, the geographically most remote population about
200 km to the east of Al Hoota area. Clade 3 comprises
all other localities from the southern side of Al Hajar Al
Gharbi. The internal structure of clade 3 is rather bushlike. Only two highly supported haplogroups are found:
One comprises all individuals from Wadi Bani Habib
(located in the Al Jabal Al Akhdar), the other one all
individuals from Al Hoota Cave and ten from the

Page 4 of 15

adjacent Wadi Al Falahi. The remaining haplotypes
from Wadi Al Falahi are also included in clade 3.
The analyses of the CR1+CR2 data set were performed
to obtain a better resolution of the relationships
between the three major lineages. They are based on 32
G. barreimiae individuals representing the three major
clades (Figure 3). In the resulting BI tree all three clades
are highly supported. Also the sister group relationship
of clades 2 and 3 obtained strong support. There is no
statistical support for clade 1 grouping together with the
two other G. barreimiae clades. Moreover, the distances
(average p-distances) between clade 1 and the other two
G. barreimiae clades are even higher (11% in both
cases) than those between G. rufa and clade 1 (9%). The
distances of clade 2 and 3 to G. rufa are smaller (9%).
Therefore, more distantly related outgroup species
(Cyprinus carpio, Carassius gibelio, Labeo senegalensis,
Barbus barbus) were included to root the tree. This tree
(Figure 3) illustrates the separated position of clade 1,
which is genetically very distinct from the other G. barreimiae, even tough the localities Wadi Bani Awf and
Wadi Hat are geographically rather close to those represented in clade 3 (Figure 1a). The fact that G. rufa has
smaller distances to each of the G. barreimiae clades
than those found within G. barreimiae suggests that the
species G. barreimiae as currently defined might not be
monophyletic.
A network of the complete G. barreimiae CR1 data set
is shown in Additional file 1. The different clades and G.
rufa are depicted in different colours. This network
shows that the position of clade 1 with respect to the
other G. barreimiae clades is quite distant. Clade 1 is
found outside of G. rufa, this node is 31 substitutions
away from the nearest node connecting G. rufa with
clade 2. Clade 2 is separated by nine substitutions from
clade 3 and clearly separated from G. rufa (28 substitutions). Details of clade 3 are shown in Figure 4.
Phylogenetic relationships within clade 3

A TCS network based on CR1 sequences is shown in
Figure 4. To enable a detailed display it includes only
individuals from the populations comprising clade 3
(Wadi Dhum, Wadi An Nakhar, Wadi Misfat, Al Hamra
Falaj, Al Hoota Cave, Wadi Al Falahi, Ain Al Msalla and
Wadi Bani Habib). The individuals from the other five
localities are genetically too distinct to be connected
within the 95% connection limit (eight steps) and form
separate groups, which are not shown. In the 122 individuals 34 different haplotypes were found. Four haplotypes (5, 11, 14, 15) are rather frequent occurring in
more than 10 individuals, six haplotypes occur in two to
six individuals, and the remaining 24 haplotypes occur
only once. The most interesting finding is that all individuals from Al Hoota Cave are found within one

whereas the remaining haplotypes differ by one (eight
haplotypes) or two (one haplotype) substitutions. This
haplogroup not only contains the specimens from Al
Hoota Cave but also includes 10 individuals from Wadi
Al Falahi. The main haplotype of this group differs by

four substitutions from another main haplotype that
occurs in 13 individuals from five different localities.
The network clearly shows that Wadi Bani Habib is the
only locality that does not share any haplotype with
individuals from other localities. Like Al Hoota Cave it
is restricted to one haplogroup, while all other localities

are genetically mixed with haplotypes shared between
the different localities. The central haplotype 15 is separated by only one substitution from two other common
haplotypes (11 and 14).
The haplotype diversities in Al Hoota Cave (0.67) and
the adjacent localities Wadi Al Falahi (0.76) and Ain Al
Msalla (0.68) are similar, while the nucleotide diversity
in Al Hoota Cave (0.28) is much lower than in the other
two localities (0.72 and 0.74). This is because the variation within Al Hoota Cave population consists mainly of
single substitutions.
In a mismatch distribution analysis the Al Hoota Cave
population showed a unimodal distribution indicating
recent population expansion after a bottleneck [26]. In
contrast the population consisting of the remaining
localities from clade 3 showed a more ragged distribution generally fitting a distribution expected under a
growth/decline model. In the Al Hoota cave population

the Fu’s Fs test statistic [27] and R2 statistic [28] were
both significant (p < 0.01; p < 0.001) rejecting the
hypothesis of constant population size. Clade 3 (except
Al Hoota Cave) was significant for Fu’s Fs test statistic
(p < 0.001), but not for the R2 statistic (p = 0.091). It
has been shown that for small sample sizes R2 statistic
performs better, whereas for larger sample sizes Fu’s Fs
test statistic performs better [28].
Troglomorphic state of the investigated individuals

Troglomorphic features are fully developed only in later
stages. For juvenile fish (larvae) this prevents unambiguously evaluating, whether a particular individual would
have developed to a troglomorphic phenotype or not.
The sampled fishes were of different developmental
stages. The largest individuals collected in the surface
waters measured 67 mm SL (standard length), the largest from the Al Hoota cave were 47 mm in length.

Our measurements confirm the finding of [14] that the
troglomorphic phenotype is not yet well displayed in
individuals smaller than 24 mm. Of the 72 individuals
from the cave, only one specimen with 6 mm SL had
well-developed eyes. Individuals between 14.5 and
23 mm (11 specimens) had partly reduced eyes. In the

larger individuals of this group the eyes were sunken
but still visible. All the other fishes that derived from Al
Hoota Cave (>23 mm SL) had troglobiotic morphology.
In six individuals of this group, faint remnants of eyes
were visible, whereas the remaining specimens showed
completely reduced eyes and no pigmentation. The

Troglomorphic characters were missing in nearly all
individuals from surface populations. One exception was
an adult individual collected from a different drainage
system (Falaj), an irrigation channel near the town Al
Hamra. This specimen was clearly troglomorphic (31
mm SL), suggesting that other troglomorphic populations might exist beside Al Hoota Cave. The haplotype
(25) of this specimen is genetically only distantly related
(2%) to the blind specimens from Al Hoota Cave. Other
exceptions included some individuals collected in the
ponds close to the cave exit in the Wadi Al Falahi on
the 2nd of December 2006 after a flood which brought
big amounts of water from the cave to the surface. All
17 individuals showed a very weak pigmentation and the
eyes were of variable size or not visible at all (Figure 5).
Nine of them had clearly reduced eyes (27 - 45 mm SL),
while eight had eyes that appeared to be functional (25
mm - 30 mm SL); we did not, however, perform any
anatomical analysis. In addition, four individuals collected on the 24th and the 26th of January 2001 in Wadi
al Falahi were also microphthalmic (49 - 55 mm SL). All
other fish collected from surface waters (114; 25 of these
below 14 mm SL) had well-developed eyes and full
pigmentation.

Discussion
Genetic differentiation between troglomorphic fish of Al
Hoota Cave and surface-dwelling fish of Wadi Al Falahi

What do the results reveal with respect to the origin of
the troglomorphic forms? The main question of the
study was whether the two morphotypes of G. barreimiae are genetically differentiated and whether gene
flow occurs.
In the network (Figure 4) all individuals from Al
Hoota Cave belong to one haplogroup ("cave haplogroup”), but this group contains also a few individuals
from adjoining Wadi Al Falahi. Hence there is no strict
correspondence between haplogroups and the two ecological environments. The “cave haplogroup” shows a
pattern which suggests a founder effect caused by a single invasion into the cave followed by fast expansion;
this is also supported by the mismatch distribution analyses. The presence of surface-dwelling individuals in
this haplogroup might be explained by incomplete lineage sorting, which we consider unlikely for the following
reasons: All Al Hoota specimens belong to one haplogroup. This “cave haplogroup” is not found in any
other locality except in a few individuals collected in
Wadi Al Falahi at the exit of Al Hoota Cave. Moreover,
the vast majority of Wadi Al Falahi samples belong to
several different lineages (i.e. haplotypes 13, 14, 23, 15,
11, 27, 18, 28, 17; Figure 4) and only a single

Page 8 of 15

haplogroup is shared with individuals in the cave. None
of the other various haplotypes found in Wadi Al Falahi
was detected in Al Hoota specimens. Finally, most of
the individuals of Wadi Al Falahi possessing cave haplotypes show troglomorphic characters. In summary these
facts indicate that the extant populations of Al Hoota
and Wadi Al Falahi are not completely separated. Two
potential scenarios explain how the populations might
get into contact. (i) Although most of the water bodies
in the wadi dry out frequently, fishes with eyes appear
within a few days after rainfalls in the surface water
(observation by HS and RS). Hence, fish might retreat
into the groundwater, where they might get into contact
with individuals of the cave population. For the surface
dwelling fish, however, these environmental conditions
might not be suitable for breeding. (ii) During floods,
fishes might be sometimes washed out from the cave
into Wadi Al Falahi. Up to 200 m3/sec [29] can flow out
from the Al Hoota Cave into the Wadi Al Falahi after
heavy rain. Concerning the direction of gene flow, our
data support a sporadic translocation of individuals
from Al Hoota Cave into the Wadi Al Falahi. From the
ten individuals of the “cave haplogroup” caught in Wadi
Al Falahi, six had reduced eyes. If gene flow was acting
in both directions, some individuals with intermediate
phenotypes or with “surface” Wadi Falahi haplotypes
would be expected in Al Hoota Cave. Neither of these
cases was detected and thus the most likely explanation
is that occasional gene flow occurs from the cave to the
surface, only. This could explain both the presence of
samples with “cave haplotypes” and the occurrence of
intermediate phenotypes in Wadi Falahi. The question,
however, is whether the blind individuals can reproduce
in surface water bodies. One would assume that blind
fish have a low probability of surviving long and reproducing in surface populations because of impairment by
radiation or by high predator pressure (e.g., from water
insects, fish and birds). Gene flow is therefore expected
to be quite low between surface- and cave-dwelling fish.
Besides the various intermediate forms, four individuals of the “cave haplogroup” from the Wadi Al Falahi
possessed eyes that resembled the surface phenotype
(Figure 5). It remains unknown whether the eyes of the
latter individuals are functional: to date no systematic
morphological investigation has been performed,
whether there is a plastic response of eye development
in the presence or absence of light. A single report by
Banister [14] notes that the development of the optic
lobes was influenced by light. Behavioural changes due
to light exposure during development have been documented by [30]: light reared juvenile fish showed significantly higher photophilic behaviour than dark reared
juvenile individuals. Should the eyes in the four above
mentioned individuals be functional, then the most

plausible explanation is that these individuals are
hybrids between the two populations (or their descendants) that retained the cave haplotype but are able to
develop functional eyes. In summary, our data indicates
that the troglomorphic individuals of G. barreimiae living in Al Hoota Cave sporadically interbreed with individuals of the adjacent wadis.
Another question concerns the age of the cave population. An answer would provide indirect hints about
the underlying mechanisms for the development of troglomorphic features. Surface and cave forms were
crossbred in the laboratory (Wilkens, personal

communication in [30]), suggesting that the two genomes are still compatible. If the eyeless condition was a
genetic trait that became fixed due to relaxed selection
pressure for maintenance of vision-related traits in the
cave, then this would require some time. In this context
the divergence time of lineages is of interest and dating
of the split of the “cave haplogroup” based on genetic
distances would be desirable. This is problematic
because there is no reliable calibration for a molecular
clock of G. barreimiae. The cave is of Plio-Pleistocene
age, roughly one to three million years old. This might
be set as the earliest date for the origin of the cave

Kruckenhauser et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:172
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/172

population. Nonetheless, the “cave” and the “surface”
haplogroups may already have split some time before
the intrusion into the cave. It is also possible that the
cave population originated much later, and/or from a
surface population with a different (more closely related)
haplotype, which we either did not sample or which
does no longer exist.
Despite these uncertainties, the observed genetic differentiation between sequences of the “cave haplogroup”
and those from the surface populations is low (minimum 0.91% in the CR1 fragment). P distances are in the
range of those found within several surface populations
of G. barreimiae. Attempts have been made to calibrate
a substitution rate for the cytochrome b (cytb) gene in
cyprinids: 0.53% per million years [21] and 0.76% per
million years [22]. For the mitochondrial CR no calibration exists, but it can be assumed that this section, due
to less selective constraints, has a higher substitution
rate compared to cytb. Applying the rates for the cytb
gene for our CR1 data set would most probably result
in an overestimate of the actual divergence time of epigean and hypogean G. barreimiae. Anyway, a rough calculation based on the distance of 0.91% and the two
above mentioned rates yields a split below 1 mya (0.86
or 0.60 mya, respectively). This would disagree with the
results of Colli et al. [23], who estimated the divergence
time between epigean and hypogean G. barreimiae
between 0.8 - 2.0 Mya based on a 795 bp sequence of
cytb. This calculation remains dubious because it is
unclear whether those sequences [23] represent the
functional cytb gene or nuclear pseudogenes (numts copies of mitochondrial genes that have been translocated into the nuclear genome) or chimeras of both. In
the study of [31] the cytb sequences were composed of
two independently generated PCR-products. Our preliminary experiments revealed the presence of cytb numts
in this genus. We used primers that bind in the flanking
t-RNA genes to amplify the whole gene (1140 bp) in
one fragment (data not shown). Comparing the complete cytb sequences obtained in our study with those of
[31] shows that in the 3’-section they are almost identical; while in the 5’-section they are quite different (8%
p-distance). The most plausible explanation is that [31]
presented a sequence chimera. An extensive investigation of cytb in this genus would be necessary to draw
final conclusions and to disentangle authentic mtDNA
sequences and numts. In any case, it is currently impossible to use cytb data for any attempt to date splits in G.
barreimiae.
The very low genetic distances between cave and surface populations (Al Hoota/Wadi Al Falahi) suggests
that the Al Hoota population is quite young. This indicates an evolutionary mechanism for troglomorphic
characters that differs from the simple accumulation

Page 10 of 15

and fixation of neutral mutations. The results favour a
selection-driven hypothesis as was suggested for Astyanax, where increased shh expression proved to cause
eye degeneration and enhanced forebrain and taste bud
development [5-8]. In the evolution of troglomorphic
phenotypes, however, the same genes are not necessarily
always have to be involved, and selective pressures influencing different cave species may not be the same all
over the world. Factors affecting a cave population can
vary widely (e.g., composition of the cave coenoses,
availability of trophic resources, water regime, frequency
of exchanges with the surface environment, etc.). Differences in physiology or the presence of preadaptations to
cave life must also be considered, along with phenotypic
plasticity and epigenetic effects. The effect of different
environmental pressures can be particularly strong if the
development of troglomorphic traits is due to epigenetic
modifications or other changes in gene regulation. The
plasticity of the depigmentation in G. barreimiae, which
is reversible to some extent in the presence of light
(observation by HS, [13]), is in accordance with the presumed recent origin of the cave population.
A very remarkable finding is that the single blind fish
from Al Hamra Falaj surface locality had a haplotype
(25) which is highly divergent from the Al Hoota Cave
haplogroup. It did not occur in any other individual and
is closely related to a haplogroup comprising individuals
from various surface populations (Figure 4). We assume
that this adult individual, which was caught in an irrigation channel, originally derived from a yet unknown
cave population where the troglomorphic phenotype has
developed independently. Convergent evolution of cave
fish populations from different surface populations has
also been documented for Astyanax species [17,18,32].
Alternatively, the phenotype of this specimen could be
ascribed to a recent mutation with pleiotropic effects,
and the individual by chance survived until maturity.
The latter scenario, however, seems highly unlikely
because, as far as it is known from other cave fish,
aborted eye development is a multifactorial trait in
which at least six genes are involved and, in addition,
the lack of pigmentation is caused by different genes [5].
Phylogeography and taxonomic considerations

Within clade 3 (Figures 3 and 5) the populations Wadi
Al Falahi, Ain Al Msalla, Al Hamra Falaj, Wadi Misfat,
Wadi An Nakhar and Wadi Dhum are genetically closely related and do not show any geographic structure.
Within most of the localities, we found various haplotypes which are shared between different localities. This
suggests frequent gene flow between localities. The
wadis are usually not connected on the surface, but
underground water bodies might exist which enable
migration between the wadis. Flooding may also connect

Kruckenhauser et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:172
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/172

wadis. Another explanation would be that a former variable panmictic population was split only very recently
through the separation of the wadis. The age of the
youngest dripstone activity in Al Hoota Cave dates back
6,000 - 10,500 years [33]. This date corresponds with
the last more humid period, in which the contact of different populations in permanent rivers within the same
river system appears likely. Although water bodies are
currently separated and thus gene flow is interrupted,
lineage sorting in the current populations may not be
completed. The geographically more distant locality
Wadi Bani Habib (35 km away from the next population
sampled) is genetically homogeneous, comprising three
connected haplotypes not found elsewhere. This group
is separated from the next main haplotypes by a minimum of 1.5% sequence divergence (six substitutions),
suggesting longer isolation of this population.
The population of Wadi Bani Khalid (clade 2 Figure
3), besides Wadi Mansah, the only sample from Al
Hajar Ash Sharqi (Western Hajar), is not only geographically the most distant one (200 km), it is also genetically rather distant (average p-distance to clade 3: 4%).
The individuals from this population were described as
a separate subspecies, G. barreimiae gallagheri, which is
morphologically close to the nominate subspecies but
differs in shorter fins and a higher number of dorsal fin
rays [34]. Our results (i.e., the distinct mitochondrial
lineage) are in accordance with this classification. Note,
however, that many regions have not been sampled so
far, for example we have no samples of the surrounding
populations of Wadi Bani Khalid. It cannot be excluded
that continuous geographic sampling would also reveal
more continuous genetic relationships. The fact that
neither this study nor any previous molecular study
included fish from the type locality of G. barreimiae
(Buraimi/Al Ain, which are nowadays densely populated) makes it difficult to address the intraspecific taxonomy of G. barreimiae based on the current state of
knowledge.
The situation is different concerning the remarkably
high genetic distances that were found between clade 1
(Wadi Hat, Wadi Bani Awf1, Wadi Bani Awf2 and Wadi
Mansah) and the other clades. In fact, the genetic analyses question whether the individuals of clade 1 belong
to G. barreimiae because the distances between this
clade and the other lineages of G. barreimiae are in the
same range as those between clade 1 and G. rufa. Our
data do not resolve the phylogenetic relationships with a
high statistical support. Although the specimens from
these localities resemble G. barreimiae at first sight, no
morphological analyses have been performed that definitely support this assignment. Thus, we cannot exclude
the possibility that the populations of clade 1 represent
a different species. Any taxonomic revision of Garra in

Page 11 of 15

Southeast Arabia should include phylogenetic analyses
of samples from the topotypic locality or at least of a
population close to the type locality. Nonetheless, the
high genetic distances can be explained by the fact that
these populations underwent long-term isolation
because the water bodies they inhabit are separated by a
watershed.

Conclusions
Our data indicate that the troglomorphic cave population is of quite recent origin, supporting the hypothesis
that selection drives the evolution of troglomorphic
traits. In this context pleiotropic effects might play an
important role as has been shown for Astyanax. There
seems to be some gene flow from the cave population
into the adjacent surface populations. Nuclear markers
need to be employed to corroborate this result and to
assess the amount of gene flow in more detail. The single blind individual found at a geographically distinct
surface locality is genetically differentiated from Al
Hoota Cave, indicating the probable existence of
another cave population of G. barreimiae. The population at Wadi Bani Khalid is genetically separated, while
the other surface populations from separated wadis
seem to be sporadically in contact or have been in contact until recently. Certain populations belong to a very
distant lineage. Based on the genetic marker used, the
monophyly of G. barreimiae cannot be confirmed.
Methods
Sample collection and DNA extraction

From 2001 to 2008, G. barreimiae were sampled by H.
Sattmann, R. Seemann, R. Illek and E. Fischer in the
Western and Eastern Al Hajar Mountains in the Sultanate of Oman. A total of 208 G. barreimiae specimens
were collected at 12 localities (Figure 1a and 1b). One
of the populations was located within Al Hoota Cave
(72 individuals, Figure 1b), while all the others were surface populations. Sample localities, abbreviations and
numbers of specimens are listed in Table 1. Collected
animals were preserved in 80% ethanol and are stored
in the scientific collections of the NHMW. In addition,
we included five specimens of Garra rufa; two of them
were obtained (Gruf-1 and Gruf-2) from a breeding
stock (originating from Kangal, Turkey; Paul Hofer,
Wiener Neustadt, Austria; “rent a fish”, 04/2006), while
the others are specimens of the fish collection of the
Museum of Natural History Vienna: Gruf-6 (Baykan,
Siirt, Turkey, NMW 85794), Gruf-11 (Firat Nehri Birecik-Urfar, Turkey, NMW 87890), and Gruf-13 (Pella,
Jordan, NMW 94980). From all specimens a tiny piece
of the right pectoral fin was cut off for DNA extraction.
All material collected between 2001 and 2006 was
extracted by incubation of tissues in a 10% Chelex (Bio-

Rad) solution containing proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) for 4
h at 56°C (with agitation). Subsequently, extractions
were heated to 95°C for 5 min and centrifuged for 1
min. The supernatant was purified using the QIAquick
PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) with a final volume of 30
- 70 μl elution buffer. DNA extraction from all samples
collected in 2007 and 2008 was performed using the
DNAeasy blood and tissue kit (Quiagen) following the
manufacturer’s protocol and using an elution volume of
80 μl.
Morphological evaluation

All individuals were evaluated concerning troglomorphic
characters (eye development, pigmentation). When the
iris and the pupil were completely visible the eyes were
evaluated as functional. However, as all G. barreimiae
(even those from the cave population) develop eyes in
their early stages, the evaluation of whether they are troglomorphic or not is meaningful only in individuals
above a certain size (>24 mm, [14]). We measured the
standard length (from the tip of the snout to the root of
the caudal fin, SL) of all specimens and evaluated only

individuals above 24 mm. From selected individuals we
took photographs (e.g., Figure 5) of the anterior part
(from the tip including at least the whole operculum;
5.6 times magnification) and of the eye region including
the nostrils (20 times magnification). Additional photographs are available from the authors on request.
PCR amplification and sequence analysis

The following primers were used for PCR amplification:
Gar-Thr1+ (5’-GCATCGGTCTTGTAATCCGA-3’),
TDK_DGbar1- (5’-CCTGAAATAGGAACCAGATG-3’),
CR1+_Gbar (5’-GCAGTAAGAGACCACCAAC-3’),
12SR5 (5’-GGCGGATACTTGCATGT-3’), CR2+_Gbar
(5’-GAATCAAGGGCAATAATAGTGGG-3’), CR3_Gbar (5’-TCTGGGTGGTTTTGTGTTGC-3’), CR4_Gbar (5’-TTGGGCGTCGGCGGTGAGAG-3’). With
the exception of primer 12SR5 (designed by Tomas
Hrbek, pers. comm.) all primers were designed in the
present study. From five individuals the whole mitochondrial control region (CR) was isolated by combining two
overlapping fragments: 5’ (Gar-Thr1+/TDK_DGbar1-); 3’
(CR1+_Gbar/12SR5), the two external primers bind in

Kruckenhauser et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:172
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/172

the flanking tRNA-Thr gene and in the 12SrRNA gene,
respectively. As some samples had low DNA quality, we
chose the 5’-section (approx. 440 bp) for the comprehensive analysis (CR1, 150 individuals). From selected individuals (altogether 33) representing the various clades, an
additional 68 bp overlapping fragment (CR2, 545 bp),
which covers the region 3’ adjacent to CR1, was amplified
with the primer pairs CR2+_Gbar/CR3-_Gbar or CR2
+_Gbar/CR4-_Gbar. Primers CR3- and CR4- bind partly
or completely within the region of the putative tRNAPro, thus this region was not present in the alignment
used for the phylogenetic analyses. Combination of CR1
+CR2 led to an alignment of 861 bp. This data set
included also several outgroup species that possess a
tRNA-Pro gene at the standard position, directly between
the tRNA-Thr gene and the CR. Since the gene is missing
at this position in Garra, we excluded this part from the
CR1+CR2 alignment, which starts with position 21 of the
CR of G. barreimiae.
PCR was performed with 35 reaction cycles on a Master gradient thermocycler (Eppendorf) in 25 μl with 0.5
U Dynazyme DNA polymerase (Finnzyme OY), 1 μM of
each primer and 0.2 mM of each dNTP (Boehringer
Mannheim). Control reactions of both DNA extraction
and PCR amplification were performed. PCR products
were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit
(Quiagen) and sequenced directly, or they were
extracted from agarose gels using the QIAquick Gel
Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and cloned prior to sequencing
(TOPO TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen). Sequencing of both
strands was performed by AGOWA (Germany), direct
sequencing of PCR products was performed using the
same primers as in the PCR.
Genetic data analysis

Sequences were edited in BioEdit version 5.0.9 [35]. The
alignment of sequences from the genus Garra was
straightforward because there were very few insertions
or deletions. Besides G. rufa, the following sequences
from GenBank were used as outgroup: Cyprinus carpio
(X61010), Carassius gibelio (GQ985484), Labeo senegalensis (AB238968), and Barbus barbus (AB238965). The
alignment including sequences from other genera was
performed with t-coffee [36] and adjusted manually (no
regions of the alignment were deleted prior to the analyses). Average p-distances (pairwise exclusion of gaps)
were calculated using MEGA version 4 [37], which was
also used to calculate NJ trees [38]. Nodal support was
evaluated with nonparametric bootstrapping based on
1000 replicates. BI analyses were performed using
MrBayes 3.1.2 [39] applying the following models of
sequence evolution for nucleotide sequences according
to the Akaike information criterion (AIC) as implemented in the program MrModeltest v2.2 [40]: HKY+G (for

Page 13 of 15

the CR1 data set) and TrN+G (for the combined: CR1
+CR2 data set). Runs were started with random trees
and performed for 2 million generations each with four
Markov chains and a sampling frequency of every 100th
generation. Those trees generated prior to stationarity
were discarded as burn-in and were not included in the
calculation of the consensus trees. An unrooted parsimony haplotype network (95% probability level) of clade
3 was constructed by the method of [41] with the software TCS version 1.21 [42], treating gaps as 5th character state. A full median-joining network [43] of the
complete G. barreimiae CR1 data set was constructed
with network 4.6.0.0 (available at http://www.fluxusengineering.com), putting equal weight on each site.
The numbers of haplotypes and the haplotype diversities
were calculated with ARLEQUIN 3.11 [44]. Past demographic fluctuations were assessed by calculating the
mismatch distribution [26] as implemented in DnaSP v5
[45] to fit the observed data with models of population
expansion. As a statistical test for population growth, we
calculated the R2 statistic [28] and Fu’s Fs test statistic
[27]. In both cases small values suggest recent demographic expansion. Significance (a = 0.05) of both the
R2 statistic [28] and Fu’s Fs test statistic were evaluated
by comparison to a distribution generated from 10,000
random simulations of the data in DnaSP v5.
Analyzing demographic fluctuations requires having a
reasonable assumption about what a population actually
is and to have an appropriate sampling. We chose Al
Hoota Cave (25 specimens) and the group of localities
found within clade 3 (except Al Hoota Cave; 97 individuals) as the only two populations for which a mismatch
analysis is suitable. For the other genetically isolated
clades, a mismatch analysis is not meaningful: The sample size of clade 2 is too small, and clade 3 is composed
of two geographically disjunct populations (see results).
The sequences determined in this study are deposited
at GenBank under the accession numbers: CR1:
JF709013 - JF709129; CR1+CR2: JF709135 - JF709162;
complete CR: JF709130 - JF709134.

Ernst Fischer, Heinz Kollmann, Goran Batic, Hisham Momen, Peter Elster, Fritz
Koller and Heinz Holzmann for support in practical field work. We thank
Sandra Kirchner, Barbara Däubl, Simone Latkolik and Michael Mülleder for
valuable technical assistance, Josef Harl for making the photographs and
Walter Salzburger for providing several primers at an early stage of the
study. Anton Weissenbacher, Harald Ahnelt and Florian Wicker confirmed
the taxonomic assignment of the fish. Ernst Mikschi provided samples from
the NHM collection. For discussions and comments on the manuscript we
are grateful to Wilhelm Pinsker and Werner Mayer. This study was
conducted in the course of the project “Speleoman” concerning the
geology, biology, conservation and tourist management of the Al Hoota
Cave. Robert Seemann, who was the scientific leader of the project
“Speleoman”, passed away unexpectedly on December 20th, 2010. We owe
him so much for his warmth, his comprehensive and persevering input to
the entire project and particularly for his positive involvement in this study.
