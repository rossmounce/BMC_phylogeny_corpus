Cytoplasmic- and extracellular-proteome analysis
of Diplodia seriata: a phytopathogenic fungus
involved in grapevine decline

Abstract
Background: The phytopathogenic fungus Diplodia seriata, whose genome remains unsequenced, produces
severe infections in fruit trees (fruit blight) and grapevines. In this crop is recognized as one of the most prominent
pathogens involved in grapevine trunk disease (or grapevine decline). This pathology can result in the death of
adult plants and therefore it produces severe economical losses all around the world. To date no genes or proteins
have been characterized in D. seriata that are involved in the pathogenicity process. In an effort to help identify
potential gene products associated with pathogenicity and to gain a better understanding of the biology of
D. seriata, we initiated a proteome-level study of the fungal mycelia and secretome.
Results: Intracellular and secreted proteins from D. seriata collected from liquid cultures were separated using twodimensional gel electrophoresis. About 550 cytoplasmic proteins were reproducibly present in 3 independent
extractions, being 53 identified by peptide mass fingerprinting and tandem mass spectrometry. The secretome
analysis showed 75 secreted proteins reproducibly present in 3 biological replicates, being 16 identified. Several of
the proteins had been previously identified as virulence factors in other fungal strains, although their contribution
to pathogenicity in D. seriata remained to be analyzed. When D. seriata was grown in a medium supplemented
with carboxymethylcellulose, 3 proteins were up-regulated and 30 down-regulated. Within the up-regulated
proteins, two were identified as alcohol dehydrogenase and mitochondrial peroxyrredoxin-1, suggesting that they
could play a significant role in the pathogenicity process. As for the 30 down-regulated proteins, 9 were identified
being several of them involved in carbohydrate metabolism.
Conclusions: This study is the first report on proteomics on D. seriata. The proteomic data obtained will be
important to understand the pathogenicity process. In fact, several of the identified proteins have been reported as
pathogenicity factors in other phytopathogenic fungi. Moreover, this proteomic analysis supposes a useful basis for
deepening into D. seriata knowledge and will contribute to the development of the molecular biology of this
fungal strain as it has been demonstrated by cloning the gene Prx1 encoding mitochondrial peroxiredoxin-1 of
D. seriata (the first gene to be cloned in this microorganism; data not shown).

Background
The fungal family Botryosphaeriaceae (Botryosphaeriales,
Ascomycetes) is a complex family that, according to a
recent broad-based phylogenetic study, includes ten genera [1]. The majority of these genera comprise members
described as fungal endophytes, present in virtually all
woody host examined (both gymnosperm and

angiosperm species) [1,2], and being the dominating
endophyte communities in Eucalyptus and Pinus in
some environments [3]. One of the most important
members of this family is Diplodia (which includes teleomorphs distributed in several genera). Diplodia seriata
(before named as Botryosphaeria obtusa) is an important
phytopathogenic fungus that has been isolated from at
least 34 different hosts, causing severe infections in fruit
trees (mainly pomes and stone fruits) [4]. Also recently,
D. seriata has been described as an important pathogen
of grapevines (Vitis vinifera), involved in grapevine

trunk disease causing the death of adult plants [5].
Grapevine decline, or grapevine trunk disease, is currently recognized as the main threat to vineyards all
around the world since no effective treatment to fight
this fungal pathology is presently available [6,7]. D. seriata can be isolated from grapevines exhibiting dieback
of shoots, spurs and branches, as well as severe internal
wood necrosis symptoms [8]. It is also a cosmopolitan
grapevine pathogen which has been detected all around
the world [9]. Its contribution to grapevine decline is of
major importance since it has been the most frequently
isolated pathogen in an extensive survey on affected
grapevine plants carried out in Spain. In fact, 63% of the
total Botryosphaeria-like species isolated from young
plants and 28% of the pathogenic isolates from adult
plants were identified as D. seriata, which represent
around 36% of the total isolated pathogen fungi associated to grapevine decline [10]. Despite the importance
of D. seriata as phytopathogen, little is known about its
biological life cycle, its basic molecular aspects and the
mechanisms involved in the pathogenicity of this fungal
species. Botryosphaeriaceae species are known to produce phytotoxic compounds like exopolysaccharides and
other toxic organic compounds which induce phytotoxic
effects on plants [11,12], but unfortunately no D. seriata
pathogenicity-related genes has been deposited yet in
databases.
Proteomic studies are one of the most powerful methods to evaluate the final result of gene expression. In
the present case two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) has been the technique of choice to obtain a referential global picture of the cytoplasmic and extracellular
protein maps. Up to now, this technique has been successfully applied to analyze not only the proteome and/
or secretome of many different fungal strains [13,14],
but also plant-pathogen interactions, including analyses
of several phytopathogenic fungi [15-17]. Regarding phytopathogenicity, the phylum Ascomycota comprises
highly appreciated species in food and pharmaceutical
industries, but also others dreaded as phytopathogens
due to their secreted proteins [18]. However, the understanding of the molecular basis of the secretion process
in these microorganisms is still very limited. As
reviewed above, a considerable number of proteomic
analyses have been carried out in fungal species in the
last years, mainly concerning strains of medical or agricultural interest. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, no
proteomic data have been reported yet for D. seriata.
Thus, the main goal of this manuscript is the achievement of an initial approach to define the D. seriata proteome and secretome. Protocols for protein extraction
from mycelium, protein separation by 2-DE and mass
spectrometry (MS) analyses have been optimized.
Furthermore, proteome differences have also been tested

by growing the strain in the presence of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). Since cellulose is one of the major
components of the plant cell wall, proteins overexpressed during growth on CMC could be expected to
play a significant role in the pathogenicity process. In
fact, this strategy has been used to identify putative
pathogenicity factors in the phytopathogenic fungus
Botrytis cinerea [19,20]. We decided to try this strategy
since D. seriata is an endophytic fungi that exerts its
pathogenicity by developing inside the vascular system
of grapevine, and unfortunately to date no experimental
approach is available that mimics the natural conditions
in which D. seriata is developing its pathogenicity. In
this way, this manuscript contributes to the knowledge
of biological basic aspects of this important phytopathogenic fungus, and, therefore, means a first step in the
development of the molecular biology of this fungal
strain. In fact, the gene encoding mithocondrial peroxyrredoxin-1 was cloned, sequenced and characterized
(data not shown) based on the amino acid sequence of
several internal peptides identified by tandem mass
spectrometry (MS/MS).

Results and discussion
Analysis of fungal growth in the experimental
conditions tested

Fig. 1A shows the growth curves of D. seriata in liquid
cultures developed in Czapeck medium and the same
medium supplemented with CMC (1%). They were
obtained from experiments carried out in the same
experimental conditions to perform the proteome analysis. As it can be seen in Fig. 1, both curves are very
similar, which obviously indicated that CMC did not
have any significant effect over the growth rates. These
data clearly indicated that most CMC could not be
assimilated by D. seriata, as occurs in many others
fungi. As it can be deduced from the graphic, the fungal
growth in both experimental conditions increased
rapidly beyond 36 h, reaching their maximum around
96 h. Samples for proteome analysis were taken at 72 h
of growth corresponding approximately to the middle of
the exponential phase of growth. The microscopic
observation of mycelia samples collected at that time
showed (Fig. 1B) a normal mycelium structure with no
symptoms of cellular lysis.
Visualization and analysis of the secreted proteins

The secreted proteins from D. seriata analyzed by 2-DE
are showed in Fig. 2. All the secreted proteins that were
subsequently identified by PMF and MS/MS analyses
are numbered and listed in Table 1. Seventy-five extracellular proteins were reproducibly visualized in three
independent experiments and sixteen could be identified
by MS/MS. This low proportion of identified secreted

proteins against visualized secreted proteins is not
uncommon when the proteome of fungal species is analyzed, specially as in the case of D. seriata the genome
remains unsequenced, which obviously makes difficult
the identification of many proteins. In fact, when the
extracellular proteomes of other fungal strains such as
Aspergillus flavus [21], Trichoderma reesei [22], Trichoderma harzianum [23], or the phytopathogen Sclerotinia

sclerotiorum [24] have been analyzed, a low ratio of
identified proteins was also obtained. In the case of D.
seriata, this fact could reflect that many of the nonidentified secreted proteins are specific to this fungal
species, or perhaps specific to endophytic fungi. The
lack of proteomic analyses and of a significant number
of characterized genes in endophytic fungi undoubtedly
represents a limiting factor in the identification of proteins in these phytopathogenic fungi. In fact, up to our
knowledge, no data regarding extense proteome and/or
secretome analyses of other endophytic fungi are available (with the exception of a proteome analysis of Neotyphodium lolii, an endophytic fungus from the
perennial ryegrass Lolium perenne) [25] and, in particular, there are no available data of other endophytic ascomycetes taxonomically close to Botryosphaeriales.
A clear biological or enzymatic function could be
solely attributed to ten out of the sixteen secreted proteins annotated (spots S4, S5, S8, S9, S10, S11, S12, S13,
S15, and S16), whereas the rest (spots S1-S3, S6, S7, and
S14) were annotated as hypothetical, putative uncharacterized protein or secreted proteins. In order to achieve
a better identification of these proteins, their biological
or enzymatic functions were determined. For this, the
amino acid sequence of the hypothetical protein was
used to perform a BlastP search against the non-redundant protein sequence database at NCBI (in these cases
the putative biological functions are indicated between
parentheses and in italics in Tables 1 and 2). In this
way, spots S8 and S9 were determined to correspond to

a necrosis and ethylene-inducing protein 1 (Nep1),
whereas the spot 5 was determined to correspond to a
necrosis and ethylene-inducing protein 2 precursor
(Nep2). By the same approach, S11 was identified as an
aspartate aminotransferase and S13 as a protein similar
to the cell wall protein PhiA.
Twelve of the proteins visualized in the secretome
were predicted to contain a Signal P motif (proteins S2,
S4-S9, S12-S14) or to contain a non-classical protein
secretion motif (proteins S1 and S3) indicating their
extracellular location. Four intracellular proteins (lacking
of Signal P motif) were present in the secretome of D.
seriata: NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase (spot
S10), aspartate aminotransferase (spot S11), superoxide
dismutase (spot S15) and glutathione reductase (spot
S16). Their presence might indicate that some cell lysis
may have occurred during fungal growth (although the
microscopy observation of mycelia at 72 h of growth did
not let detect any sign of cellular lysis in the liquid cultures. See Fig. 1B), and/or preparation of the secretion
protein samples, resulting in the release of some cytoplasmic proteins, even though care was taken to minimize this possibility. This problem has also been
encountered by other authors analyzing the secretome
of phytopathogenic microorganisms, concluding that the
release of cytoplasmic proteins is likely an unavoidable
consequence of sample preparation [24,26]. Alternatively,
these intracellular proteins could be secretion-signal-less
proteins that in some conditions are located at the cell
surface, or detected in culture supernatants, like it has
been reported by other fungi. These secretion-signal-less
proteins are secreted by some unknown mechanism.
Many of these proteins are glycolytic enzymes, chaperones, translation factors and others suggesting that they
could be ‘moonlighting’ (multifunctional) proteins. In
fact, a glutathione reductase (spot S16) has been identified as a secretion-signal-less protein in S. cerevisiae [27].
Also, Murad and colleagues have described a extracellular aminotransferase secreted by the entomopathogenic
fungi Metarhizium anisopliae [28].
As it might be expected, some of the secreted proteins
identified are proteins or enzymes that could be
involved in pathogenesis. Thus, an enzyme like glucosidase (spot S4), responsible for the degradation of the
polysaccharydes found in the plant cell wall, would
allow the invading phytopathogenic fungus to penetrate
more easily the plant cells. Other proteins involved in
peptide and/or protein degradation such as peptidase 1
(spot S12) could be responsible for the degradation of
cell wall proteins and the inactivation or inhibition of
some plant defense response proteins, whose expression
may be induced by pathogen challenge. This possibility
has been suggested for some secreted proteases from
the phytopathogenic ascomycete Sclerotinia sclerotiorum

Page 7 of 16

[24]. Spots S5, S8 and S9 were identified as necrosis and
ethylene-inducing proteins (Nep1 and Nep2). Nep proteins represent a new class of necrotic elicitors. Indeed,
the extracellular Nep1 protein, initially identified from
the culture filtrate of Fusarium oxysporum, has the ability to induce different kind of injuries in susceptible
plants, such as necrosis in cacao or cell death and
necrotic spots in Arabidopsis thaliana [29,30]. Plant
responses to Nep proteins include induction of pathogen related (PR) genes, accumulation of ROS and ethylene, changes in K + and H + channel fluxes, callose
apposition, altered cell respiration, induction of the
hypersensitive response and localized cell death [29].
Finally, spot S13 could correspond to a cell wall protein
PhiA. In Aspergillus nidulans, PhiA protein is highly upregulated by exposition to several antifungal compounds
[31] and it is involved in phialide and conidium normal
development [32]. These data suggest that this protein
could play a significant role as a defense mechanism
against some antifungal responses, as when the plant
produces toxic metabolites and, at the same time, the
synthesis of PhiA initiates to ensure fungi survival by
producing conidia [32].
Although we also made several attempts in order to
characterize the secretome of D. seriata when growing
in the presence of CMC the gels obtained were always
of very poor quality due to irresoluble technical problems. The capability of D. seriata to metabolize CMC
is limited and therefore high amounts of CMC remained
in the supernatant cultures that interfered with the protein precipitation protocols. We tried to remove CMC
from supernatants by several methods, including extensive dialysis and precipitation of CMC by using ammonium sulfate (80%), or PEG-CaCl2, but in all cases no
satisfactory results were obtained.
Visualization and analysis of cytoplasmic proteins

The proteins extracted from the whole mycelia of D.
seriata and separated by 2-DE are showed in Fig. 3. Of
the 550 mycelial proteins reproducibly visualized in the
2-DE gels from three independent protein extractions,
53 proteins were identified by PMF and MS/MS as
shown in Table 2. However, 25 out of these 53 proteins
were annotated in databases as hypothetical or putative
uncharacterized proteins. As indicated above for the
secreted proteins, a BlastP search against the nonredundant protein sequence database (NCBI) was performed by using their amino acid sequences (their putative biological functions are indicated between
parentheses and in italics in Table 2) in order to achieve
a better identification of the biological or enzymatic
functions of these hypothetical proteins. This strategy
let us assign a clear biological or enzymatic function to
22 out of the 25 hypothetical proteins.

Figure 3 2-DE CBB-stained 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels of D. seriata cytoplasmic proteins corresponding to a liquid culture carried out in
normal conditions (A), and to a liquid cultured developed in the presence of CMC. (C).- Density plots graphically representing the (%)
volumen average corresponding to the proteins up-regulated (+) and down-regulated (-) are shown. (%) Vol. corresponds to the volume of each
spot divided by the total volume of all the spots in the gel. Differentially expressed proteins were considered when the ratio of the (%) Vol.
average (3 gels) between conditions was higher than 1.5 and the p-value deduced from the t-test was <0.05. The density plots corresponding to
each category (up- and down-regulated proteins) are ordered from higher to lower ratios (as showed in Table 3).

The 53 annotated proteins represented 44.7% of the
total spot volume (%Vol), whereas it is remarkable that
the first 12 spots identified (numbered 1 to 12 in Table
2) corresponded to 29.75% of the total spot volume.
These values obviously indicated that these proteins are
highly abundant in the cytoplasm of D. seriata and
probably suggest a relevant cellular function. In fact, 6
out of the 12 more abundant proteins were glycolytic
enzymes like phosphoglycerate kinase (spots 1 and 10),
triose phosphate isomerase (spot 6), enolase or phosphopyruvate dehydratase (spot 3), glyceraldehyde 3phosphate dehydrogenase or GAPDH (spot 11) and

fructose bisphosphate aldolase (spot 12). This can be
explained biologically if we take into account that the
glycolytic pathway plays a central role in the cellular
energetic metabolism, and obviously glycolytic enzymes
are found among the most expressed proteins in many
different organisms.
As D. seriata is a phytopathogenic fungus, the annotation of proteins of importance in the pathogenesis process is of special interest. In this way, the case of
GAPDH is significant since it is a very complex enzyme
which possesses, besides its role in the glycolytic cycle,
up to other fifteen different functions in mammalian

Cobos et al. Proteome Science 2010, 8:46

cells and microbial pathogens [33], including a role as
virulence factor for a vast variety of microbial pathogens
[34,35]. Curiously, the second most abundant cytoplasmic protein (spot 2; 4.33%Vol) was identified as a peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase (also spots 16 and 31) or
cyclophilin. Cyclophilins have peptidyl prolyl cis-trans
isomerase activity that performs protein folding by catalyzing the isomerization of peptide bonds preceding proline residues [36]. More interestingly, cyclophilins have
been reported as an important virulence factor in the
plant infection of rice by the ascomycete fungus Magnaporthe grisea [37], in the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans
[38] and in the later infection stages or plant colonization by Botrytis cinerea [39].
Another abundant protein (spot 8) was identified as a
signal transduction protein. A BlastP search let us confirm that this protein showed high amino acid identity
(58%) to a CipC-like antibiotic response protein from
Aspergillus fumigatus (gi|70997948). CipC-like antibiotic
response protein (or concanamycin-induced protein) has
been identified as an up-regulated protein in several
fungal strains exposed to antibiotics, e.g. A. nidulans. In
addition, in S. sclerotiorum, seven ESTs corresponding
to CipC were identified during interactions with Brassica napus and classified as pathogenesis-associated
genes [40]. In the case of the phytopathogenic soilborne
fungus Verticillium dahlia, CipC protein has been suggested to help to its survival in soil by inactivating antibiotics produced by other soil microorganisms [41].
Spot 18 was identified as malate dehydrogenase (MDH).
This enzyme catalyzes the reversible conversion of

Biogenesis of cellular
components (1.9% )

oxalacetate and malate. Oxalacetate is an oxalic acid
precursor which has been described as a pathogenicity
factor in B. cinerea [42], since the secretion of this acid
is supposed to create an acidic environment that makes
easier the pathogenic activity of the fungus. A role of
MDH in pathogenesis has also been suggested for B.
cinerea since this enzyme is produced exclusively or at
higher levels in a more virulent B. cinerea 2100 strain
[43]. Apart from the above-mentioned proteins, we
could also identify (spot 40) a putative mitochondrial
heat shock 70 kDa protein (HSP70) which is a molecular chaperone essential for tolerance to protein denaturing stresses as well as for protein biogenesis. HSP70
seems to be involved in fungal pathogenesis since it has
been reported to facilitate the infection of coffee leaves
by the fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides [44].
Some of the in-gel visualized proteins that we tried to
identify could not be annotated, probably due to the
fact that homologous proteins are not present in databases, which obviously could indicate that most of them
might be novel or uncharacterized. In fact, proteomic
analysis of many fungal species, particularly filamentous
fungi, is difficult due to the lack of publicly available
genome sequence data and the problems associated with
cross-species comparisons [15].

identified proteins (67.9%) were metabolic enzymes or
proteins involved in energy production. The proteins
involved in energy production could be categorized into
two groups. First, those involved in the glycolytic pathway
like phosphoglycerate kinase (spots 1 and 10), enolase
(spot 3), triosephosphate isomerase (spots 6 and 28), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (spot 11), aldolase (spot 12), phosphoglyceromutase (spot 38) and
pyruvate kinase (spot 35). Second, those that are components of the tricarboxylic acid pathway and mithocondrial
proteins: pyruvate decarboxylase (spots 39, 43, 49) and
malate dehydrogenase (spot 18). Several of the proteins
identified are involved in carbohydrate metabolism such as
UDP-glucose 4-epimerase (spot 45), mannitol-1-phophate5-dehydrogenase (spot 47), UDP-galactopyranoside
mutase (spot 48), alcohol dehydrogenase (spots 50 and 53)
and aldose reductase (spot 52); whereas others such as
NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase (spots 23 and
32), saccharopine dehydrogenase (spot 26) and S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (spot 36) are engaged in amino
acid metabolism. Besides, several proteins involved in
nucleic acid metabolism were annotated such as a nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (spot 20), adenosine kinase (spot
21), biphosphate nucleotidase (spot 41) and two proteins
related to thiamine biosynthesis (spots 14 and 17).
There were also proteins (7.6%) implicated in cell rescue, defense and virulence like mitochondrial peroxiredoxin 1 (spots 25 and 33), a heat shock 70 kDa protein
(spot 40) and a flavohemoprotein (spot 51).
The remaining functional categories included a lower
number of proteins. Thus 5.6% were classified as unknown
proteins. The same percentage (5.6%) was estimated to be
proteins involved in protein fate, like peptidyl-prolyl cistrans isomerase (spots 2, 16, and 31). Proteins with regulatory and binding functions, like a predicted Zn-finger
U1-like protein (spot 4) and a Rab GDP dissociation

inhibitor alpha (spot 42) represented 3.8%; whereas proteins with a role in the transcription/translation processes,
like an eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A-1 (spot
24), an endonuclease reverse transcriptase (spot 27) and
an elongation factor 1b (spot 30) represented 5.6% of the
characterized proteins. As for spot 44 (biogenesis of cellular components, 1.9%), it was identified as a putative peptidoglycan synthetase FtsI, which obviously does not make
any sense in a fungal strain, indicating that the primary
role of this protein is still to be determined. Finally, solely
one protein (spot 8; 1.9%) was classified into the cellular
communication/signal transduction category.
Differentially expressed cytoplasmic proteins in
the presence of CMC

Since cellulose is one of the major components of the
plant cell wall, those proteins up-regulated when a phytopathogenic fungal strain grows in its presence are supposed to have a significant role in the pathogenicity
process. This approach has been recently postulated as
useful for the identification of putative pathogenicity
factors in Botrytis cinerea [19,20]. As reported above,
the analysis of the corresponding sets of 2-DE gels
revealed an average of 550 protein spots in the proteome of D. seriata. Three proteins were overexpressed
when the fungus grew in the presence of CMC [CMC is
a cellulose derivative with carboxymethyl groups bound
to the hydroxyl groups of the glucose unit. There can be
up to three substituents on each glucose unit, thus the
maximal degree of substitution is 3]. Two of them were
identified as mitochondrial peroxiredoxin-1 and alcohol
dehydrogenase (Table 3), suggesting a putative role in
the pathogenicity process. The third protein could not
be identified despite the good quality of the PMF spectra, probably due to the absence of similar proteins in
protein databases.

Peroxiredoxins (PRXs) are an ubiquitous family of
thiol-specific antioxidant proteins that help to control
intracellular peroxide levels. They also control cytokineinduced peroxide levels which mediate signal transduction in mammalian cells. Their broad distribution and
high levels of expression suggest that they are both an
ancient and important enzyme family [45]. On the other
hand, as a ROS, hydrogen peroxide seems to play a significant role in plants under severe environmental conditions, including biotic stresses produced by
phytopathogen infection. In fact, hydrogen peroxide participates in many resistance mechanisms, including reinforcement of the plant cell wall, phytoalexin production,
and enhancement of resistance to various stresses [46].
Taking together all these evidences, we might speculate
that an increase in the H2 O 2 levels in grapevine, as a
result of fungal infection, could be counteracted by an
increase in the peroxiredoxin levels in the fungal cells.
In fact, peroxiredoxins have been proved to be important not only for resistance to H2O2 stress but also for
virulence in the dimorphic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans, since they contribute to virulence in a mouse
model [47]. Also it has been reported that peroxiredoxin
Tsa1 is highly induced during 37°C hyphal growth in
Candida albicans (the pathogenic form of this
dimorphic yeast), and that the thioredoxin system genes
are induced after peroxide exposure [48]. All these data
support that an increase in the levels of peroxiredoxins
in fungal strains could significantly contribute to the
development of the pathological response in phytopathogenic fungi.
Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) are complex enzymes.
Up to 7 different ADHs (ADH1 to ADH7) have been
identified in Sacharomyces cerevisiae [49]. Although the
primary role of ADH (ADH1) is to catalyze the production of ethanol from acetaldehyde in cells grown anaerobically or in the presence of a glucose excess, they can
also achieve other cellular functions such as the catalyzation of the opposite reaction (ADH2 and ADH5 can
convert ethanol accumulated during aerobic growth to
acetaldehyde) or the participation in aldehyde reduction
in oxidative conditions (ADH6), allowing the use of 2,3butanediol as carbon and energy source [50]. The putative meaning of increased levels of ADH observed in the
presence of CMC (and its putative role in virulence)
seems more difficult to decipher. In fact, in the pathogen C. albicans, it has been reported that Adh1p
restricts its ability to form biofilms on catheter surfaces
through an ethanol-based mechanism and that the disruption of the ADH1 gene does not affect its ability to
form the pathogenic hyphal form of this fungus [51].
We might speculate that the higher levels of ADH
detected in the presence of CMC could be related to a
tendency of the fungus growth to perform an anaerobic

Page 11 of 16

metabolism under this condition. Perhaps, this could
reflect some difficulty to access oxygen when D. seriata
grows inside the trunk of grapevines (in the vascular
system), where availability of oxygen may be reduced. In
these conditions, a higher ADH activity could be beneficial in order to obtain energy. However, we must not
forget that in the presence of CMC up to four glycolytic
enzymes are down-regulated (Table 3): fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, triose phosphate isomerare, phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase, which obviously
implicated a slower rate of efficiency of the glycolytic
pathway, and therefore lower intracellular pyruvate
levels available for ethanol production. This fact could
be compensated by the nitrate reduction (remember
that nitrate is the sole nitrogen source in the Czapeck
media used) to nitrite, and the subsequent reduction to
ammonia, coupled with the catabolic oxidation of ethanol to acetate and substrate-level phosphorylation that
supports growth under anaerobic conditions [52].
Out of the 30 proteins down-regulated in the presence
of CMC, solely 9 could be identified (Table 3). Most of
these proteins are glycolytic enzymes (spots 12, 6, 35
and 1) or proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism
(aldose reductase, spot 52), which is difficult to understand if we bear in mind that the fungal strain is growing in a culture media supplemented with CMC and
containing sucrose. Regarding this point, we could speculate that the metabolism of CMC could have some
negative/inhibitory effect on some key enzymes of the
glycolytic pathway. It should be noted that CMC can be
degraded at different rates depending on the effectiveness of the different types of cellulases produced by the
fungal strain to attack CMC. Different sugars (glucose,
cellobiose, cellotriose, cellotetraose and cellopentaose)
can be generated as degradation products [53]. The
identification of these CMC-degradation products suggests that the carboxy-methyl groups of CMC could be
released as acetate, which might exert a repressive effect
on the levels of different glycolytic enzymes, as it has
been shown for the bacteria Escherichia coli [54]. In this
way, the CMC metabolism could be the cause in the
observed diminishing of the levels of several glycolytic
enzymes. Alternatively, it could be also possible that the
reduced amounts of some glycolytic enzymes could be
due by an increased carbon flow through the pentose
phosphate pathway.
Finally, we could emphasize that although, as indicated above, the growth of phytopathogenic fungi in the
presence of CMC has been postulated as a promising
tool for the identification of putative proteins important
for pathogenicity, our results indicated that, at least in
the case of D. seriata, no significant differences could be
detected in the proteome of this fungus grown in a
defined medium and in the same medium supplemented

Cobos et al. Proteome Science 2010, 8:46
http://www.proteomesci.com/content/8/1/46

with CMC, since a limited number of proteins were upor down-regulated. Unfortunately, Fernández-Acero and
colleagues [20] did not compare the growth of Botrytis
cinerea proteome under normal conditions and cellulose-degradation conditions, in order to establish differences in the proteomes.

Conclusion
The main aim of this study was to perform a proteome
analysis of the significant phytopathogenic and endophytic fungus D. seriata in order to understand better its
lifecycle as well as its ability to infect grapevine plants
producing trunk diseases. This is the first approach to
study the proteome of this fungal strain which contributes to cause severe economic losses to wine industry
all around the world. Notoriously, a high proportion of
the identified proteins in the secretome could have a
significant role in the pathogenicity process, including a
glucosidase and a peptidase that could be involved in
the degradation of the vegetable cell wall. More interestingly, three necrosis and induced proteins (Nep) were
identified in the secretome of D. seriata. This is particularly intriguing since Nep proteins share a high degree
of sequence similarity and they are able to induce an
hypersensitive-like death response in a variety of plants,
also inducing necrotic responses in plant tissues [55].
The putative role of D. seriata Nep proteins in the
initiation or progression of the grapevine infection process needs to be further investigated in order to determine their significance for pathogenicity. Moreover, the
detection of a putative secreted PhiA protein needs to
be highlighted, since a high production of this protein
has been suggested to ensure fungi survival by inducing
a higher conidia production rate in response to the presence of toxic metabolites.
Regarding cytoplasmic proteins and in addition to the
annotated proteins involved in basic cellular functions
such as energy and metabolism, protein fate or transcription and protein synthesis, several proteins identified as virulence factor in other fungal strains were
annotated. Among them, we can cite GAPDH, 3 peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerases (or cyclophilins), a CipClike antibiotic response protein, malate dehydrogenase
and a mitochondrial heat shock 70 kDa protein.
The differences observed in the proteome by growing
the fungi in the presence of CMC were minor than
expected, since solely three proteins were up-regulated
and thirty down-regulated. These data could mean that
this strategy might not be very effective to identify putative pathogenicity factors in phytopathogenic fungi.
Finally, we would like to add that we hope that this
study means a first step to advance in the necessary
molecular biology studies of D. seriata that can

Page 12 of 16

contribute to deciphering the role of these putative
pathogenicity factors in the development of grapevine
decline diseases.
Finally, we hope that the proteomic data obtained will
let us in a future develop further studies. In fact, and
based on the peptide sequences obtained in this work,
we have cloned and sequenced the D. seriata Prx1 gene
(data not shown). This is the first gene of this important
phytopathogen to be cloned, which supposes a significant contribution for the developing of the Molecular
Biology in this microorganism. In fact, a transformation
methodology for D. seriata is currently being developed
to try to interrupt or attenuate the expression of Prx1
gene in order to check its putative role in the virulence
process. The development of this methodology will let
us in a future to check the involvement of other putative
virulence proteins identified in this study in the pathogenicity process.

Materials and methods
Culture conditions

The fungal pathogen Diplodia seriata (isolated from an
affected Vitis vinifera plant) was routinely maintained
on potato dextrose agar (PDA) (Scharlau Chemie S.A.,
Barcelona, Spain) plates at 4°C. Liquid cultures were
performed through the following protocol: a total of 12
Czapeck agar plates (sucrose, 3%; NaNO 3 , 0.4%;
K 2 HPO 4 , 0.1%; MgSO 4 ·7H 2 0, 0.1%; FeSO 4 ·7H 2 0,
0.001%; and agar, 2%) were surface-covered with cellophane sheets. Plates were inoculated in the center with
an agar plug (0.5 cm) removed from the outer edge of
a 6-day-old fungal colony grown on Czapeck agar
plates and incubated at 25°C for 5 days. The mycelia
from two Czapeck plates were removed from the cellophane and disrupted with a beater. Next, mycelia were
transferred to flasks containing 150 ml of Czapeck
liquid medium (control conditions), or Czapeck liquid
medium supplemented with 1% carboxymethylcellulose
(CMC) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The cultures
were incubated in an orbital shaker at 120 rpm and
25°C for up to 7 days. The whole fungal proteome and
secretome of D. seriata were prepared respectively
from fungal mycelia and culture supernatants from 3day-old liquid cultures. Three independent replicates
were analyzed. Culture supernatants were collected by
filtration and secreted proteins were immediately precipitated. Mycelia were harvested by filtration, washed
with sterile water and stored at -20°C until use. Fungal
growth was estimated as dry-weight of mycelia by filtering 5 ml of liquid cultures through a glass fiber filter (0.5 μm pore size). Mycelia were washed 3 times
with deionized water and dried at 80°C for 48 h before
weighing.

Protein extraction

Cytoplasmic proteins were isolated by using a protocol
based on that of Fernández-Acero and colleagues [56],
which was modified as follows. Frozen mycelia were
ground to a fine powder with a pre-cooled mortar and
pestle using liquid nitrogen. Two grams of powder were
stirred (4°C for 2 h) in 10 ml of 10 mM potassiumphosphate buffer (K2HPO4-KH2PO4) (pH 7.4) containing 0.07% (w/v) 1,4-DTT and supplemented with Complete™ protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany) (one tablet per 10 ml of buffer). The cellular
extracts were clarified twice by centrifugation (5 min, 15
000 × g). Proteins were precipitated for at least 1 h at
-20°C after the addition of 1 volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in acetone containing 0.14% (w/v)
DTT. The protein pellet was washed twice with acetone
followed by an additional washing step with 80% acetone. The proteins were finally resuspended in 500 μl of
sample buffer: 8 M urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.5% IPG Buffer
pH 3-10 NL (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden), 20 mM
DTT, and 0.002% bromophenol blue. The insoluble fraction was discarded by centrifugation at 15 000 × g for 5
min. The supernatant was collected and protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein
Reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and bovine
serum albumin as standard.
To prepare the secreted proteins for the secretome
analysis the proteins from culture supernatants (100 ml)
were precipitated for at least 1 h at -20°C after the addition of 1 volume of 20% TCA in acetone containing
0.14% (w/v) DTT. The precipitated proteins were harvested by centrifugation at 15 000 × g for 20 min at 4°C.
The protein pellet was washed twice with acetone followed by an extra washing step with 80% acetone, and
then resuspended in 500 μl of sample buffer. The insoluble fraction was discarded by centrifugation (5 min, 15
000 × g). Protein concentration was determined as indicated above.

Ettan Dalt Six apparatus (GE Healthcare) for 45 min at 3
W per gel, and then for 3.5 h at 18 W per gel. Precision
Plus Protein Standards (Bio-Rad) were used as protein
markers. Gels were stained following the “Blue Silver”
staining method [57] using 0.12% CBB G-250 (Sigma),
10% ammonium sulfate, 10% phosphoric acid and 20%
methanol.
Gel analysis

2-D images were captured by scanning stained gels
using a ImageScanner II (GE Healthcare) previously calibrated with a greyscale marker (Kodak, Rochester, NY,
USA), digitalized with Labscan 5.00 (v 1.0.8) software
(GE Healthcare) and analyzed with the ImageMaster™
2D Platinum v 5.0 software (GE Healthcare). Three gels
of each strain obtained from three independent cultures
(biological replicates) were analyzed to guarantee representative results. After automated spot detection, spots
were checked manually to eliminate any possible artifacts, such as streaks or background noise. Biological
replicates showed less than 10% and 5% of variability in
the number of protein spots detected for intracellular
and extracellular proteomes, respectively. The patterns
of each sample were overlapped and matched, using
landmark features, to detect potential differentially
expressed proteins. The gel presenting the highest spot
number was selected as Master gel and the coefficient
of determination (r2) for each gel pair was calculated in
order to ensure the analyses reliability (pair average r2:
0.82). Spot normalization, as an internal calibration to
make data independent of experimental variations
among gels, was made using relative volumes (%Vol) to
quantify and compare the gel spots. %Vol corresponds
to the volume of each spot divided by the total volume
of all the spots in the gel. Differentially expressed proteins were considered when the ratio of the %Vol average (3 gels) between conditions was higher than 1.5 and
the p-value deduced from the t-test was <0.05.

2-D gel electrophoresis

Protein Identification by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS and MS/MS

For the analysis of the cytoplasmic and extracellular proteomes 18-cm IPG strips [pH 3-10 NL (non-linear), GE
Healthcare] were loaded with 350 μg of soluble proteins
in the sample buffer (see above). Proteins were focused
using an Ettan IPGphor II (GE Healthcare) at 20°C
according to the following program: 1 h, 0 V; and 12 h,
30 V (rehydratation); 2 h, 60 V; 1 h, 500 V; 1 h, 1 000 V;
30 min gradient up to 8000 V; and finally 7 h at 8,000 V
until 50 kVh. Focused IPG gels were equilibrated twice
for 15 min in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH
8.8), 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.002% bromophenol blue and 1% DTT. For the second equilibration step,
DTT was replaced by 4.0% iodoacetamide. The second
dimension was run on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel in an

The protein spots of interest were manually excised
from CBB-stained gels by biopsy punches, placed in a
microcentrifuge tube, and washed twice with ddH2 O.
The proteins were digested following the method of
Havlis et al. [58]: samples were dehydrated with ACN
(Carlo Erba, Barcelona, Spain) for 5 min, reduced with
10 mM DTT (GE Healthcare) in 25 mM ammonium
bicarbonate (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) for 30 min at
56°C and subsequently alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide (MS grade; Sigma) in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 15 min in the dark. Finally, samples were
digested overnight at 37°C with 10.0 ng/μl of sequencing-grade modified porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA) in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.5).

Cobos et al. Proteome Science 2010, 8:46
http://www.proteomesci.com/content/8/1/46

After digestion, the supernatant was collected, speedvacuum dried and resuspended in 4 μl of 50% ACN,
0.1% TFA in ddH2O. One μl was spotted on a MALDI
target plate and air dried for 10 min at room temperature. Subsequently, 0.5 μl of matrix [3 mg/ml of acyano-4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid (LaserBio Labs,
Sophia-Antipolis, France)] diluted in 0.1% TFA-ACN/
H2O (1:1, v/v) was added to the dried peptide digestion
and air dried for another 5 min at room temperature.
The samples were analyzed with a 4800 Proteomics
Analyzer MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). A 4700
proteomics analyzer calibration mixture (Cal Mix 5;
Applied Biosystems) was used as external calibration.
All MS spectra were internally calibrated using peptides
from the trypsin digestion. The peptides observed (up to
65 peptides per spot) were collected and represented as
a list of monoisotopic molecular weights with a S/N
greater than 20 using the 4000 Series Explorer v3.5.3
software (Applied Biosystems). All known contaminant
ions (such as trypsin- and keratin-derived peptides)
were excluded from further consideration in protein
database search and later MS/MS analysis. Hence, from
each MS spectrum, the fifteen most intensive precursors
with a S/N greater than 20 were selected for MS/MS
analyses with CID (atmospheric gas was used) in 2-kV
ion reflector mode and precursor mass windows of ±7
Da. The default calibration was optimized for the MS/
MS spectra processing.
For protein identification, Mascot Generic Files combining MS and MS/MS spectra were automatically created and used to interrogate a non-redundant protein
database using a local license of Mascot v 2.2 from
Matrix Science through the Global Protein Server (GPS)
v 3.6 (Applied Biosystems). The search parameters for
the PMF and MS/MS spectra were set as follows:
i) NCBInr (2009.11.03) sequence databases were used;
ii) taxonomy: All entries (9993394 sequences), Fungi
(644746 sequences); iii) fixed and variable modifications
were considered (Cys as S carbamidomethyl derivative
and Met as oxidized methionine); iv) one missed cleavage
site was allowed; v) precursor tolerance was set at 100
ppm and MS/MS fragment tolerance at 0.3 Da; vi) peptide charge was 1+; vii) the algorithm was set to use trypsin as the enzyme. Protein candidates provided by this
combined PMF and MS/MS search were considered as
valid when the global Mascot score was greater than 83
(total database) or 71 (fungi database) with a significance
level of p < 0.05. Further additional criteria were taken
into account for confident identification. First, the protein match should have at least 15% sequence coverage.
Second, only those proteins with a Mascot ions score
(see Table 2: Total Ion Score) above 77 in the MS/MS
analysis (with a significance level of p < 0.05) should be

Page 14 of 16

considered as valid. Due to the almost absolute absence
of protein or DNA sequences deposited in databases for
D. seriata, those non-confirmed proteins after Mascot
database search were identified by de novo sequencing
and BLAST similarity searching following the procedure
described by Liska and Shevchenko [59]. All MS/MS
spectra for a sample were sequenced de novo using ProBLAST software (Applied Biosystems). The best fragmented ions were manually selected and the top ten
candidate peptide sequences for each MS/MS were combined into a single text-format search string by means of
the DeNovo Explorer software (Version 3.6) included in
GPS Explorer Software (Applied Biosystems). This search
string was used for similarity searches using the BLASTP
algorithm [version 1.4.0] against an in-house protein
sequence database containing the NCBInr sequence database (date: 2010.01.28; 10385566 sequences; 3543119913
residues) under the following parameters: i) fixed modifications: Cys as S carbamidomethyl derivative; ii) mass
tolerance: 0.3 Da iii) E-value threshold: 20; iv) scoring
matrix: PAM30MS; v) algorithm enzyme: trypsin. Protein
identification significance was judged using the BLASTP
scoring algorithm. Only those proteins matched by a
minimum of two peptide sequences with a score higher
than 52 according to DeNovo Explorer software were
included in the results list, providing more stringent criteria for the identification. Information about the peptides identified can be found in the additional file 1
(Cytoplasmic PRO-BLAST peptides), additional file 2
(Secretome PRO-BLAST peptides), and additional file 3
(MASCOT Search Results).
Protein functional annotation

For proteins with no assigned function, homology searches
were performed using the BlastP program against all nonredundant protein sequences deposited in the NCBI database http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi. Protein alignments were considered to be significant when their evalue was below 10-30. The secretion mechanism was predicted using SignalP (for classical secretion signal motifs)
and SecretomeP (for non-classical signal motifs) software
[60,61]. The identified proteins were distributed into categories according to their involvement in the biological
process based on the MIPS Functional Catalogue (FunCat:
http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/proj/funcatDB/
search_main_frame.html) [62].
