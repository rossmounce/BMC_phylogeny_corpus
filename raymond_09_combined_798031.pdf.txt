Abstract
Background: With the goal of improving yield and success rates of heterologous protein
production for structural studies we have developed the database and algorithm software package
Gene Composer. This freely available electronic tool facilitates the information-rich design of
protein constructs and their engineered synthetic gene sequences, as detailed in the accompanying
manuscript.
Results: In this report, we compare heterologous protein expression levels from native sequences
to that of codon engineered synthetic gene constructs designed by Gene Composer. A test set of
proteins including a human kinase (P38α), viral polymerase (HCV NS5B), and bacterial structural
protein (FtsZ) were expressed in both E. coli and a cell-free wheat germ translation system. We
also compare the protein expression levels in E. coli for a set of 11 different proteins with greatly
varied G:C content and codon bias.
Conclusion: The results consistently demonstrate that protein yields from codon engineered
Gene Composer designs are as good as or better than those achieved from the synonymous native
genes. Moreover, structure guided N- and C-terminal deletion constructs designed with the aid of
Gene Composer can lead to greater success in gene to structure work as exemplified by the X-ray
crystallographic structure determination of FtsZ from Bacillus subtilis. These results validate the
Gene Composer algorithms, and suggest that using a combination of synthetic gene and protein
construct engineering tools can improve the economics of gene to structure research.

Background
The gene to structure endeavor faces intrinsic challenges at
several steps in the experimental pathway. The primary
challenge is expressing the great quantities of protein
required to support structural studies, and this challenge
can be magnified by the use and necessity of heterologous
expression systems. While many research pursuits begin
with protein purification, the extent of material required
is a burden somewhat unique to protein crystallography.
A second major problem of protein crystallography is
identifying a suitable protein construct, given that small
changes in the protein can have profound effects on crystallization [1,2]. These two problems are related since
small changes in the protein construct can also have profound effects on the level of protein expression, solubility,
and diffraction quality of protein crystals obtained. One
recent report notes that construct engineering can double
the number of targets expressing soluble protein in a heterologous system, and can provide a fourfold increase in
the likelihood of obtaining well-diffracting crystals [2].
These aggregate improvements can enable extensive crystallization trials.
It is well known that codon utilization is highly biased
and varies considerably among various organisms and
codon usage is considered a key determinant of eventual
heterologous protein expression [3]. Codon bias in
genomes can be defined as the unequal usage of synonymous codons in known or predicted open reading frames
(ORFs). Codon-usage patterns are related to the relative
abundance of tRNA isoacceptors, and genes encoding
highly expressed proteins show differences in their codon
usage frequencies [4]. Extensive research by Karlin and
Sharp have demonstrated that highly expressed genes in E.
coli and other bacteria have a significant bias towards certain subsets of codons [5,6]. Moreover, bacteria and unicellular eukaryotic organisms seem to have codon biases
that are highly correlated with measured isoaccepting
tRNA levels [7-9]. In general, where it has been measured,
higher eukaryotes also appear to have codon biases that
complement the abundance of isoaccepting tRNAs
[10,11].
It is generally thought that codon usage alters peptide
elongation rates, however codon-usage patterns can also
improve the fidelity and kinetic efficiency of translation
[12]. Since the level of isoaccepting tRNAs in E. coli are
correlated with codon bias, it is likely that the presence of
rare codons has a negative impact on expression of heterologous genes. It is also likely that the kinetics of translation are improved by more closely matching the codon
usage of a recombinant gene product to the usage of the
expression host [3,13-17]. Apart from the nonrandom use
of codons, it has also been noted that codon/anticodon
recognition is influenced by sequences outside the codon

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/9/37

itself, a phenomenon termed codon context [18-20].
There is, for example, an occurrence bias between specific
adjacent codon pairs and these biases are different for
highly expressed versus low expressed proteins in E. coli
[21-23]. Clearly, there are still a number of mysteries in
the subject of codon bias and codon context. Taken
together these results also emphasize how difficult it is to
create "codon optimized" genes for expressing proteins
since the rules are complex and not yet fully defined.
As noted recently, more empirical evidence about protein
expression from engineered genes is still needed, and
efforts are being made to database the outcomes of gene
engineering [24,25]. There remain a variety of other factors that should be considered when engineering synthetic genes and the details of "optimal" gene design
continue to evolve [26]. For example, the synthetic gene
sequence should not only contain the proper codon bias
and codon context, but should also not result in mRNA
secondary structures that may inhibit translation [27].
Additional considerations such as unusual sequence
repeats, and cryptic regulatory sequences (e.g. Shine-Dalgarno, splice sites, RNase cleavage sites, etc.) can impact
the fidelity and yield of protein expression [28].
Large scale projects in genomic sequencing and protein
structure determination are producing enormous quantities of data on the relationships between 2D gene
sequence and 3D protein structure. Moreover, such efforts
are providing experimental data on success factors at every
step in the gene to structure research endeavor. This
wealth of information should be used in a feedback cycle
to facilitate the design and production of genes and protein constructs that are engineered for the successful production of functional protein samples for structural
studies. Fundamentally, this goal represents a bioinformatics software challenge.
To better address this issue in the context of synthetic gene
design, we have created a Protein Construct Design interface for Gene Composer which distills protein structure
information from PDB files and comparative sequence
information into a graphical user interface that allows the
user to simultaneously analyze known protein structures,
together with homologous target protein sequences for
which derivative constructs can be designed. This interface
allows the user to simultaneously understand sequence
conservation, ligand contacts, and known or predicted
structural elements to define candidate protein constructs
for crystallization and then design harmonized nucleic
acid sequences to express those proteins.
To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we have used
Gene Composer to design protein constructs, as well as
the synthetic gene sequences to express those proteins. We

compared the resulting protein expression level to full
length proteins expressed from native genes. We initially
chose to examine proteins from three different sources
(human, viral and eubacterial) in two different heterologous expression systems (E. coli and wheat germ in vitro
cell free expression). The results show that Gene Composer designed proteins and their corresponding engineered genes can be expressed at significantly higher levels
than native genes. In addition, the results show that using
Gene Composer to design protein constructs can significantly improve the likelihood of obtaining protein crystals.

Results and discussion
Construct Design Using Gene Composer™ Software
In order to compare protein expression from engineered
genes vs. native genes we chose to examine genes with significantly different G:C content and codon usage bias. We
examined three globular proteins from three phylogenetically disparate sources including: FtsZ, the cell division
protein from B. subtilis; NS5B, the RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase from Hepatitis C Virus; and P38α, a human
protein kinase. Using Gene Composer software, we made
an alignment of each protein with published structural
information, as well as the sequences of several homologous proteins for which structural information is not
available. These alignments provided insights into the
conservation of amino acid sequences and the known
structure of homologous proteins that can be combined
to engineer superior protein constructs for expression testing and crystallization trials. As an example, The Protein
Alignment viewer of FtsZ (Figure 1) shows that the first
eleven N-terminal amino acids of B. subtilis FtsZ are not
conserved among several closely related species (Clostridium sp., Listeria sp., Staphylococcus sp., and Streptomyces sp.).
In addition, the homologous N-terminal region of Aquifex
FtsZ (PDB ID 2R6R) is present but disordered in the crystal lattice (compare 2R6R chain sequence to 2R6R model
sequence). Together, this information suggests that this Nterminal region is not important for the function and
structure of B. subtilis FtsZ, and that removal of this region
could improve protein expression. A similar analysis of
the C-terminal region of FtsZ showed that a C-terminal
region (Glu317-Gly382 in B. subtilis FtsZ) was not conserved and not present in several other constructs used to
generate FtsZ crystals (including 2R6R). Based on this
analysis we defined a truncated form of B. subtilis FtsZ
spanning residues Ala12-Ile316 (termed "FtsZ truncated").

A similar analysis was performed with NS5B and showed
that C-terminal residues were not conserved and not visible within the electron density maps of several crystal
structures. From this analysis, we identified a C-terminal
truncation spanning residues 1–568 for expression test-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/9/37

ing. Finally, an analysis of P38α showed that residues
across the entire protein were relatively highly conserved
and almost all residues could be visualized in published
crystal structures. Based on these results, we did not create
a truncated form and only attempted expression of the
full-length protein.
At this point, each target was moved into the Gene Design
module (Protein-to-DNA) of Gene Composer™. For engineered genes, the nucleic acid sequence was determined
by back-translation from the amino acid sequence. As previously described [29], multiple factors were incorporated
in the final design including E. coli codon usage, overall
G:C content, potential mRNA secondary structures, presence of out-of-frame stop codons, removal of cryptic
Shine-Dalgarno sequences, removal of repeated strings of
the same nucleic acid sequence, as well as the silent introduction and removal of select restriction sites to facilitate
cloning. For native genes, the wild-type sequences were
input with no sequence alteration. The resulting full
length engineered genes and native genes express identical
proteins, and were cloned into identical expression vectors.
Protein Expression in E. coli
In order to determine if the use of phylogenetic and structural information to design modified protein constructs
and engineering of the nucleic acid sequence resulted in
improved protein expression, we compared the level of
protein expressed from the engineered synthetic genes to
proteins (constructs listed in Table 1) expressed from
native sequences under identical conditions. It has been
well demonstrated that expression conditions (media,
temperature, inducer concentration, length of induction,
etc.) can have a profound effect of the level of protein
expression and it is certainly possible that some or all of
these variables could be optimized to alter the relative
expression levels between the engineered proteins; however we first chose to compare the expression under a single condition. This condition was based on an analysis of
expression conditions used by multiple high throughput
protein structure initiative centers and we believe a typical
representative of a common "first pass" expression condition (0.4 mM IPTG inducer at mid-log phase at 30°C for
four hours in 2YT media).

The results in Figure 2 show that the amount of soluble
protein produced by the Gene Composer engineered
genes for all three targets are either equal to or greatly
improved over the level of protein expressed from the
native gene. This improvement was most dramatic in the
case of FtsZ where gene engineering resulted in a 12-fold
increase in the amount of soluble protein from the same
weight of cell paste (full-length native vs. full-length engineered). The deletion of N-terminal and C-terminal resi-

dues did not significantly improve expression relative to
the full length FtsZ protein (15-fold increase relative to
expression from full-length native gene). The expression
of P38α from the synthetic gene was also significantly
improved (6-fold) relative to expression from the wildtype P38α gene. It is important to emphasize that synthetic gene engineering using Gene Composer does not
always result in improved protein expression, and there
was no clear improvement of expression of NS5B compared to native NS5B. We also compared the expression of

four different human GPCR membrane proteins from
engineered and native genes: human adenosine A2a
receptor (Adora2a), human adrenergic, beta-2 receptor
(b2AR), human tachykinin receptor 1 isoform long
(NK1), human Galanin receptor type 1 (GalRI). These
GPCRs were expressed as N-terminal Mistic fusions
[30,31], and in all cases the level of expression from the
engineered gene was the same or slightly higher when
compared to expression from the native gene (data not
shown).

Crystallography and Structure Determinations
In order to determine if proteins expressed from the synthetic genes could be used successfully in protein crystallization experiments, we scaled up the expression and
purified full length and truncated forms of FtsZ. The purified proteins were concentrated and used in a series of random sparse matrix crystallization screens. For the fulllength FtsZ protein, we established 768 random sparse
matrix sitting drop crystallization trials, but did not
observe any crystallization hits after monitoring trials for
one month. 192 different random sparse matrix crystallization trials were established with the truncated construct
(FtsZ truncated) and 32 different crystallization hits were
observed following 1 week of monitoring. Representative
examples of these crystal hits are shown in Figure 3. Based
on the quality of crystal morphology and initial diffraction screening experiments, we focused on a single condition (30% PEG-200, 100 mM MES pH 6.0, 5% PEG-3000)
and harvested crystals that diffracted X-rays to 2.45Å resolution. The structure [PDB code: 2RHL] was solved by
molecular replacement as described in the Materials and
Methods.

FtsZ formed orthorhombic crystals and contained two
molecules in the asymmetric unit related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis (Fig. 4A). Non-bonded contacts at
the NCS dimer interface are formed between the backbone oxygen of Lys 64 and the side chain of Asn 74 as well
as Glu 76 and Glu 84. The latter are formed via water
mediated contacts. The structure was traced from Ala 12 to
Phe 315 of FtsZ for both subunits. Although guanosine
diphosphate (GDP) was not added during the purification or crystallization, analysis of the nucleotide binding
pocket following refinement revealed prominent difference density (Fig. 4B) consistent with the presence of
GDP. The presence of GDP in the active site of FtsZ has
been observed before [32,33] and suggests that the crystal-

lized protein is functional. GDP forms direct non-bonded
contacts with the T1 loop (Gly 21-Gly 22) and T4 loops
(Gly 108-Gly 110) (Fig. 4C). The latter corresponds to the
tubulin signature motif (GGGTGTG) which is involved in
phosphate binding [34]. These domains are in similar orientations to domains previously described [35,36].
It has been shown previously that nucleotide exchange
occurs readily and has negligible conformational effects in
certain FtsZ structures[33]. To determine if this was the
case for the B. subtilis FtsZ structure, crystals of FtsZ:GDP
were soaked in the presence of GTP-γ-S. The crystals
(FtsZ:GSP) tolerated the soaks well and diffracted to the
same resolution (2.45) as FtsZ:GDP crystals. Similar to
FtsZ:GDP, this structure [PDB code: 2RHO] was traced
from Ala12 to Phe315. However, the residual electron
density at the C-terminus of subunit B was weak and the
purification tag could only be traced to Leu316. Also, residues Lys221 and Gly222 on chain B were disordered and
were not modeled. Examination of the difference electron
density revealed that subunit A contained GTP-γ-S as there
was clear density for the γ-phosphate. However, the GDP
in subunit B was not exchanged as evident by difference
density which was consistent with GDP. Interactions with
GTP-γ-S and FtsZ are similar to those observed in the
FtsZ:GDP structure except that the γ-phosphate forms
contacts with Ala71 and Ala73 of the T3 loop.
Two additional crystal forms were obtained in the presence of lithium sulfate. A primitive tetragonal form,
FtsZ:SO4, was found to contain a single sulfate bound in
the nucleotide pocket [PDB code: 2RHH]. This sulfate ion
occupies position similar to that of the β-phosphate of
GDP and GTP-γ-S observed for FtsZ:GDP and FtsZ:GSP.
Not surprisingly, the sulfate ion forms non-bonded contacts with residues in the T1 and T4 loops. The sulfate ion
is positioned in a nearly identical manner as that observed
in a recently published full length Bacillus FtsZ structure
[37]. A C-centered orthorhombic crystal form (FtsZ:2SO4)
was found to contain two sulfate ions in the nucleotide
binding pocket [PDB code: 2RHJ]. Additionally, prominent difference density was observed between the two sulfate ions which we clearly observed at a 6σ contour level.
Initially, a water molecule was placed at this site however
this water was surrounded by a large amount of positive
difference electron density following refinement. The unidentified atom appeared to be coordinated by two water
molecules and two oxygen atoms of the sulfates in a distorted square planar arrangement. We considered the possibility that this was a magnesium ion. However, although
four coordinate magnesium is a possibility it typically
forms six coordinate interactions[38]. We then used the
program Wasp[39] to examine the solvent structure for
potential metal ions. The water positioned at this site of
positive difference density was flagged as a possible

sodium ion. Therefore, a sodium ion was subsequently
positioned in the difference density and refined. The
refined metal-oxygen non-bonded distances and coordination geometry were consistent with those expected for a
sodium ion[40]. In this structure, the sulfate ions adopt
similar positions as the α and γ phosphates of GTP-γ-S
found for FtsZ:GSP. Similarly, non-bonded contacts are
formed between the T1, T3, and T4 loops of FtsZ and the
sulfate ions.
These results clearly show that proteins expressed from a
synthetic Gene Composer engineered gene can be successfully used in protein crystallization experiments. More
importantly, the results also show that protein construct
engineering using structural and phylogenetic information can be critical for successful crystallization of a protein target since only the truncated form of FtsZ yielded
protein crystals.
Protein Expression in E. Coli Under High-Throughput
Conditions
In order to begin to understand how often engineering of
the nucleic acid sequence will improve protein expression, we randomly chose eleven different proteins from
three different bacterial species on the National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Disease priority pathogens list,
and compared protein expression from full length wild
type genes and full length Gene Composer engineered
genes. The proteins were expressed from identical expression vectors, were amended with identical purification
tags, and the final protein product pairs had identical

amino acid sequences. All of the expressed proteins contained 6× His tags to facilitate quantitation of soluble protein expression. In these examples the proteins were
expressed using autoinduction media [41].
The results in Figure 5 show that the level of soluble protein expression is nearly identical for the randomly
selected eleven pairs of constructs (see Additional file 1).
As a control, the engineered and native FtsZ genes that
had previously demonstrated significant differences in the
level of protein expression under standard expression testing (see Figure 2) were included in the experiment. A similar result was obtained with FtsZ (see pair 12) with the
engineered gene expressing at significantly higher levels
than the wild-type gene, however there was only modest
differences between the level of expression from the engineered gene vs. the native genes for the randomly selected
constructs. This result demonstrates that redesign of the
nucleic acid sequence does not always result in improved
levels of protein expression; however it also demonstrates
that gene engineering does not lead to decreased levels of
protein production.
Protein Expression in CFS
The improved expression of FtsZ and P38α from synthetic
genes in E. coli may result from the biased codon usage of
the native genes leading to abortive heterologous protein
expression when rare tRNA pools become depleted in vivo.
It is difficult to test this possibility in vivo because of the
many factors that could potentially modulate levels of
aminoacylated tRNA pools; however it is possible to control tRNA pools in vitro. To this end, we expressed several
native and engineered gene sequences (optimized for E.
coli expression) in a wheat germ extract-based Cell Free
System (CFS, http://www.cfsciences.com). The cell free
system reagents include an excess of molecular translation
machinery, resulting in a protein expression strategy that
is not limited by depletion of tRNA pools. We cloned the
same engineered and native FtsZ, NS5B and P38α genes
into a CFS expression vector (Materials and Methods)
ensuring that the full length proteins had identical amino
acid sequences. The proteins were expressed under identical conditions and all proteins present in the final expression extract (soluble and insoluble) were resolved by SDS
PAGE. The resulting Commassie blue stained gel is shown
in Figure 6A. The results show that because the recombinant expressed proteins FtsZ, NS5B and P38α only
account for a small percentage of the total proteins
present in the CFS extracts, an accurate comparison of
expression levels of the proteins of interest cannot be
made from the SDS-PAGE analysis of the total CFS
extracts. Only the NS5B protein bands of ~ 60 KDa in
lanes 3 and 4 of Figure 6B could be reliably discerned
above the background proteins, and it appears that the

by providing an excess of molecular translation machinery in the wheat germ CFS system. Moreover, the synthetic
codon engineered versions of these genes do not appear to
offer any significant advantage for protein production in
the CFS wheat germ extract.

native gene expressed NS5B protein in lane 3 is made in
slightly larger amounts than its counterpart in lane 4 produced by the synthetic NS5B gene.
In order to more accurately compare the protein expression levels, the soluble 6X-His tagged recombinant proteins were purified from the CFS extracts by nickel chelate
bead capture and resolved SDS PAGE with Commassie
blue staining as shown in Figure 6B. The NS5B proteins
were not captured by nickel chelate and were shown to be
located entirely in the insoluble fraction of the expression
extract (data not shown). Quantification of the full length
purified FtsZ proteins shows an approximate 2-fold
increase in protein expressed from the engineered gene
relative to the native gene, while expression of full length
P38α from both sources is equal. Thus, the difference in
protein expression levels from synthetic engineered P38α
and FtsZ genes relative their native counterparts is modest
in the CFS experiment, and do not recapitulate the outcomes observed when these genes were expressed in E. coli
cells (see Figure 2). Taken together, these results suggest
that the rare codons present in the native gene sequences
of human P38α and B. subtilis FtsZ can significantly hamper protein expression of these proteins in E. coli, but this
can be overcome either by codon engineering for E. coli or

In order to explore the possibility that codon engineering
of synthetic genes for high level E. coli expression could
affect protein production in a wheat germ extract, we compared the CFS expression of synonymous pairs of genes
from Arabidopsis thaliana whose codon usage is comparable to that of wheat, wherein the native A. thaliana gene is
compared to that of a synthetic codon engineered gene
designed with codon usage of wheat genes. In all cases,
the level of CFS expression from the wheat codon engineered gene was the same or slightly higher than expression from the native Arabidopsis gene (data not shown).
This data is consistent with the suggestion that translation
machinery is not limiting for protein production in the
CFS wheat germ extract.

Conclusion
Obtaining sufficient quantities of soluble protein for
structural studies often requires expressing proteins in
heterologous expression systems. Unfortunately, the
native nucleic sequence of any gene is likely to be biased
from the evolution of that gene for expression in the
native host, and in some cases, the gene may have selective pressures to be naturally expressed at very low levels.
This bias may affect codon usage, codon context, mRNA
secondary structures, regulatory elements, etc. which will
likely impact the level of expression in a heterologous system. In order to overcome this fundamental problem, we
have developed Gene Composer software to engineer any
nucleic acid sequence for any given expression system (sister manuscript). In this report, we have systematically
compared protein expression from native genes to protein
expression from genes specifically engineered for high
level expression in E. coli.
The majority of genes tested did not result in improved
levels of protein expression. There are several possible
explanations for this result. First, the yield of soluble protein may be dominated by the balance of protein turnover. If a protein is extremely unstable, increases in the rate
of translation or fidelity of translation will have only
small effects on the steady concentration of that protein in
the cell. Future pulse-chase experiments designed to
access rates of protein translation are necessary to address
this possibility. Another possibility is that the results
reflect our lack of understanding of the many factors that
are important for protein expression and the likelihood
that the "rules" are different for individual genes and proteins. For example, the engineered synthetic genes were
harmonized for codon usage, absence of sequence

Comparative analysis of protein expression from full length synthetic genes
Comparative analysis of protein expression from full length synthetic genes. Proteins were expressed and purified
in parallel from Gene Composer engineered (E) or native (N) genes as described in Materials and Methods (see Additional File
1). Proteins from Brucella melitensis, str. biovar Abortus 2308 were compared in pairs: Pair 1) Lactate/malate dehydrogenase:Llactate dehydrogenase:TrkA potassium uptake protein (44.8 kDa); Pair 2) CbxX/CfqX superfamily:Disease resistance protein:ATP/GTP-binding site motif A (P-loop):AAA ATPase:AAA ATPase, central region (49.4 kDa); Pair 3) Glyceraldehyde 3phosphate dehydrogenase:TrkA potassium uptake protein:Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, type I (47.4 kDa); Pair

repeats, absence of repeating codons within a sequence,
reduction of local mRNA secondary structures within the
transcript, and removal of cryptic Shine Dalgarno
sequences; however, other factors may also be important
for expression. It is not possible to test these unknown factors at this point; but synthetic gene design offers the ability to incorporate and test new gene design features as they
become known.
Because we are still in the early days of discovering all of
the rules that govern gene optimization, it is important to
determine if Gene Composer designed genes reduce the
level of protein expression compared to native genes.
Engineered genes did not result in a decrease in the level
of soluble protein from the 14 different genes tested, and

in two cases, gene engineering resulted in a significant
increase in soluble expression (FtsZ from Bacillus subtilis
and human P38α). The underlying cause for the dramatic
increased expression of FtsZ from the engineered synthetic gene is not immediately clear and likely results from
a combination of factors. For example, comparison of
expression of FtsZ in E. coli vs. cell free expression may
suggest that codon usage resulted in a decrease in expression from the native gene since both engineered and
native FtsZ genes expressed at relatively high levels in this
heterologous system. The native FtsZ gene contained a
total of 19 rare codons (1.58% of all codons) which were
eliminated in the engineered gene (see Table 2), however
NS5B contained a significantly larger number of rare
codons (62 or 3.46% of all codons) but elimination of

(fusions, rearrangements, rationale surface variants, etc.)
can be rapidly implemented without multiple molecular
biology steps that can require significant amount of time
and effort. Because engineering of the nucleic acid
sequence did not decrease the level of protein expression
and in some cases dramatically improved expression, synthetic gene design can also significantly improve the gene
to crystal structure process. The utility of Gene Composer
for engineering nucleic acid sequences will improve as
more design principles are identified, especially as the cost
of gene synthesis continues to decrease and robust protocols for rapidly synthesizing genes become more available.

rare codons from NS5B had no effect on the level of
expression. The total number of rare codons may not be
important if the location of rare codons relative to individual folding protein domains or mRNA secondary structure elements could also affect protein expression. There
are clearly a large number of different factors that could be
the cause of the significant increase in FtsZ expression.
The ability to express significant quantities of FtsZ enabled the crystallization of this target and demonstrates the
utility of Gene Composer for protein design and construct
engineering for structural studies. Specifically, we used
Gene Composer to define structure-guided protein constructs for crystallization studies and showed that we were
unable to obtain protein crystals of full length FtsZ, but
did obtain multiple crystal hits from the truncated, engineered FtsZ construct (see Figures 1 and 3).
In conclusion, these results demonstrate the utility Gene
Composer for the design of protein constructs and synthetic genes to express those proteins. The use of protein
engineering to improve crystallization can have a significant impact on the gene to crystal structure process since
very complex protein construct engineering principles

Gene Composer engineering
Gene Composer engineering considerations included
codon usage frequency minimum threshold of 2%, elimination of undesired restriction sites, elimination of five
or more nucleotide repeats, placement of stop codons
every 100 bp in second and third reading frames, elimination of cryptic Shine-Delgarno sequences, and optimized
Tm and ΔG. Detailed information about engineering with
Gene Composer can be found in (Sister Manuscript).
Cloning
All amplifications were performed in 50 μl reactions using
KOD Hi-Fi polymerase (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Resulting PCR products were
resolved on 1% agarose gels in 1× TBE + EtBr, and subsequently gel-purified using Qiagen gel extraction purification protocol. Amplification products not requiring gel
purification were purified using the microfuge PCR purification kit protocol. DNA yields were assessed with a Beckman Coulter DU 500 spectrophotometer. Ligation
reactions were performed with T4 DNA Ligase (NEB),
using a 1:3 molar ratio of vector and insert DNA. Chemically competent OneShot TOP10 cells were transformed
with 6 μl of each ligation using a standard heat shock protocol. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 50 μl, and
spread on 10 cm 2XYT plates containing the appropriate
antibiotic. Following 16 hour incubation at 37°C, transformant colonies were screened by PCR and positive
clones were sequence verified.
Bacterial expression of P38α, NS5B, and FtsZ
Gene Composer engineered and native full length FtsZ
genes were purchased from DNA2.0, and subcloned into
pET28 using by AflIII/BamHI digestion. The engineered
genes were optimized for expression in E. coli using E. coli
codon usage tables and design algorithms (Sister Manuscript). For the eight other constructs in this test set,
sequence verified, pCRBluntIITopo clones were amplified
by PCR. Truncated FtsZ native and Gene Composer engineered inserts were amplified with primers to incorporate

a 5' NcoI site before the first Met ATG, and adding two
stops with a 3' BamHI site following the affinity tags.
Native P38α was amplified using primers incorporating a
flanking 5' NdeI site such that after subcloning, the 5' ATG
would fall in-frame with the vector derived N-terminal
tags. The 3' primer added two stop codons and a BamHI
site. The resulting PCR product was purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit, and sequentially digested by first
NdeI (Fermentas), ethanol precipitated and digested with
BamHI (Fermentas). Due to an internal NdeI site, two
digestion fragments were gel-purified: a 5' 238 bp fragment, flanked on both sides by NdeI, and a 3' 857 bp fragment, with 5' NdeI and 3' BamHI termini. A 3-fold molar
excess of pooled fragments was combined with NdeI/
BamHI-digested pET15b in a standard ligation. Gene
Composer engineered P38α was cloned in the same fashion, except that no internal NdeI site was present. The four
NS5B constructs were amplified with primers which add a
5' NcoI site flanking the initiating methionine ATG, followed by a 6× His tag. Two stop codons were added after
the last amino acid, followed by a 3' BamHI site for subcloning into NcoI/BamHI-digested pET15b. Cloning of
full length and truncated wild-type NS5B was complicated
by the presence of two internal NcoI restriction sites;
desired constructs were the product of multiway ligation
into pET15b. All transformant colonies were screened by
PCR, and sequence verified.
Cell free expression of P38α, NS5B, and FtsZ
Sequence verified whole gene synthesis products of native
and Gene Composer engineered versions of P38α and
NS5B were used as PCR templates for cloning into vector
pEU-E01. Full length native and Gene Composer engineered FtsZ ORFs were ordered from DNA 2.0, and served
as template for cloning of the FtsZ expression constructs.
Amplification primers for all six constructs added a 5' SpeI
site and 3' XhoI site for cloning into SpeI/XhoI-cut pEUE01 (CFS). Following spin purification of PCR products,
approximately 1 ug PCR product was digested with SpeI/
XhoI (Roche) and gel purified. Ligations were set up as
described previously, and transformation reactions were
spread on 2XYT ampicillin 100 ug/ml plates.
Expression
E. coli expression of pET P38α, NS5B, and FtsZ constructs
Cultures of 2YT supplemented with antibiotic were inoculated with single colonies of BL21(DE3) cells that had
been transformed with each sequence verified pET28 or
pET15 construct. Following overnight growth at 37°C,
cultures were diluted 100-fold in the same medium to a
final volume of 1L, shaken at 235 rpm at 37°C until
OD600 reached approximately 0.8. Cultures were induced
with 0.4 mM IPTG and incubated at 30°C for 4 hours.
Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen
at -20°C. From each expression, 1.0 g of cell paste was

(Roche), 25 units Benzonase, and 0.1 mg/mL lysozyme
and sonicated on a Branson Sonifier using a microtip, on
70% duty cycle, output 7, for 45 seconds each. Equal
amounts of total protein, as quantified by A280 measurement on NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer were
analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Samples were resolved on 4–12%
Bis-Tris NuPage 12 well 1 mm gels in 1× MES running
buffer, using reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating samples to 95°C 5 mins prior to loading and visualized by Coomassie blue staining, following manufacturer
instructions. Protein bands were visualized on a Kodak
Imager and quantified with the software ImageQuant 5.2
(Molecular Devices).
E. coli expression of pET constructs of Brucella, Burkholderia,
Rickettsia targets and pET FtsZ constructs
Pre-cultures (1.2 mL/well, in 96-well deep-well, round
bottom block) of 2YT supplemented with antibiotic and
0.5% glucose were inoculated with 15% glycerol stocks
made from isolated colonies of BL21(DE3) cells that had
been transformed with each sequence verified pET28 construct. Pre-cultures were grown at 37°C, 220 rpm for 16
hours. Cultures (1.2 mL/well, in 96-well deep-well, round
bottom block) of 2YT supplemented with antibiotic and
Autoinduction System 1 (Novagen) were inoculated with
40 uL of pre-culture and grown for 40 hours at 20°C, 220
rpm. Cultures were harvested by centrifugation and stored
at -20°C for at least 1 hour. His-tagged recombinant proteins were purified with magnetic Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen)
according to manufacturer protocols on a BioRobot 3000
(Qiagen). Purified recombinant products were analyzed
by capillary electrophoresis on Lab Chip 90 (Caliper)
using an HT Protein Expression Assay Kit, according to
manufacturer protocols.
Cell Free Systems
All sequence verified constructs for wheat germ cell free
expression (CFS) were purified with an ultra pure plasmid
miniprep kit (Marligen) and set to 1 ug/ul. Three expression campaigns were carried out on all FtsZ, NS5B, and
P38α constructs. Due to the presence of His tags on all
constructs, an H-kit was used. The H-kit contains all components necessary for transcription and translation. All
steps were performed according to the manufacturer's
instructions for small scale batch mode expression
(WEPRO1240H Expression Kit_E_ver. 2.0, Aug. 13, 2007)
[42,43]. The RNA was quantified (A260 absorbance measurements) and normalized to provide the same amounts
of each mRNA sample to the cell free translation mix.

In brief, mRNA encoding each protein was synthesized by
in vitro transcription (20 ul) of 2 ug the pEU plasmid carrying the gene under control of the SP6 RNA polymerase

samples were diluted 1:50 and quantitated against a blank
of 1:50 dilution of transcription buffer at A260 on a Beckman Coulter DU500 spectrophotometer. Thirty-three ug
RNA was added to 10.8 ul WEPRO 1240H containing 80
ng/ul creatine kinase and this mixture was laid under 208
ul 1× SUB-AMIX (24 mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.8), 1.2 mM
ATP, 0.25 mM GTP, 16 mM creatine phosphate, 250 units
of RNasin (ribonuclease inhibitor), 1 mM dithiothreitol,
0.4 mM spermidine, 0.3 mM each of the 20 amino acids,
2.7 mM magnesium acetate and 100 mM potassium acetate). Translation was carried out overnight at 15–22°C.
The following day the bilayer was mixed to homogeneity,
and then 100 ul of crude extract was removed, and spun
13,000 rpm 4°C 15 minutes. The supernatant was
removed as "soluble" fraction and the small remaining
pellet resuspended in 100 ul 10 mM Tris pH 7.5 ("insoluble" fraction). For large scale expression and purification
performed by the Desktop II robot (CFS), an H-kit was
used, running 6 mls × 6 reaction cups, one construct per
cup (six constructs total, NS5B FL, FtsZ FL, and P38α;
native and engineered versions of each). The DT II program transcribes, translates, and Ni-IMAC purifies targets
with a final elution in 0.5 M imidazole. It was carried out
using default parameters (6 hours transcription, 16 hours
translation at 15°C) and according to the manufacturer's
instructions with the following exception. The robot was
paused after the transcription step but before addition of
wheat germ to the RNA, so that the RNA for each sample
could be manually adjusted to 2600 ug/ml (0.3 ml RNA/
sample). After this adjustment, automation was resumed
through purification. Protein concentrations of fractions
from all were estimated with a detergent compatible Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer's protocols

Crystallization
Coordinates and structure factors for a FtsZ double
deletant construct (Δ1–11, Δ316–382) with GDP bound
have been deposited to the Protein Data Bank with accession code 2RHL. Crystals were obtained at 20°C in Compact Jr. (Emerald BioSystems) sitting drop plates using the
CryoF crystallization screen (Emerald BioSystems) and 1
μL of protein with 1 μL of reservoir solution. The following conditions yielded the FtsZ crystals: 30% PEG 200,
100 mM MES pH 6.0, 5% PEG 3000. All crystals were frozen in a fresh drop of their respective crystallant which
also served as a cryoprotectant.

struct (unpublished work). This construct crystallized in
the trigonal space group P3221 with a = 87.1 Å, c = 88.1 Å
and diffracted to ~ 2.8 Å resolution. The initial structure
was solved by molecular replacement with Molrep [45]
using data collected at the Advanced Photon Source
COMCAT beamline sector 32 and 1FSZ [36] as the search

model. The search model contained only homologous
residues. All other residues of the search model were
replaced with alanine. The structure was built manually
with O [46] and refined with Refmac [45]. After successive
steps of building and refinement, the R-factor converged
at ~ 24%. The structure spanned residues Ala 12 to Phe
315 as the N-terminal (1–11) and C-terminal (316–382)
residues were disordered. An isomorphous B. subtilis FtsZ
structure has been deposited to the protein data bank
(PDB ID: 2VAM) [47]. The model was improved using
Arp/Warp [48] and additional building was carried out
with Coot [49]. This refined model was used for molecular replacement searches against the additional data sets.
Residues modeled beyond Phe 315 correspond to the
rTEV-His-Glu purification tag. All refinements were performed with Refmac. Data collection and refinement statistics are provided in Table 3. Figures were created using
the Ribbons software package [50].
