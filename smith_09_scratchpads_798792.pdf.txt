Abstract
Background: Natural History science is characterised by a single immense goal (to document,
describe and synthesise all facets pertaining to the diversity of life) that can only be addressed
through a seemingly infinite series of smaller studies. The discipline’s failure to meaningfully connect
these small studies with natural history’s goal has made it hard to demonstrate the value of natural
history to a wider scientific community. Digital technologies provide the means to bridge this gap.
Results: We describe the system architecture and template design of “Scratchpads”, a datapublishing framework for groups of people to create their own social networks supporting natural
history science. Scratchpads cater to the particular needs of individual research communities
through a common database and system architecture. This is flexible and scalable enough to
support multiple networks, each with its own choice of features, visual design, and constituent data.
Our data model supports web services on standardised data elements that might be used by related
initiatives such as GBIF and the Encyclopedia of Life. A Scratchpad allows users to organise data
around user-defined or imported ontologies, including biological classifications. Automated
semantic annotation and indexing is applied to all content, allowing users to navigate intuitively
and curate diverse biological data, including content drawn from third party resources. A system of
archiving citable pages allows stable referencing with unique identifiers and provides credit to
contributors through normal citation processes.
Conclusion: Our framework http://scratchpads.eu/ currently serves more than 1,100 registered
users across 100 sites, spanning academic, amateur and citizen-science audiences. These users have
generated more than 130,000 nodes of content in the first two years of use. The template of our
architecture may serve as a model to other research communities developing data publishing
frameworks outside biodiversity research.

Background
Taxonomic, systematic, and biodiversity studies (herein
referred to as ‘natural history’) are data-intense sciences
that draw information from many disciplines in order to
build a coherent picture of the extent and trajectory of life
on earth [1]. These data are essential to our discovery,
understanding, and responsible use of the natural world
[2]. Natural historians have traditionally relied on
manual systems and techniques to gather, organise, and
publish this information. This is collectively enshrined in
scientific papers that form an archive spanning more than
250 years of published research. But as ever more
synthetic and integrated accounts of the natural world
are required to understand and mitigate threats to the
environment, the failings of traditional publication
methods for disseminating and using natural history
research have become ever more apparent.
Traditional papers struggle to accommodate the high
volume of data supporting accounts of natural history.
In recent years this has been exacerbated by the rapid
growth of semi-automated data gathering techniques
producing large-scale datasets such as those incorporating genomic, phylogenetic, and image based components. The size and diversity of these datasets mean that
they are at best marginalised to an electronic ghetto on
publishers’ websites. But all too often natural history
data are simply never published [3]. The low impact of
most natural history research, coupled with the high
transaction costs associated with publication and access,
mean that much (perhaps most) natural history data
only exists tacitly and informally within expert networks
of specialists (i.e. in the minds, notebooks and computers of the people generating the data). Such data are
imperilled by a decline in the number of professional
specialists engaged in these networks, such as that
reported amongst biological taxonomists. Indeed, this
had lead some to question the long-term viability of
natural history as a professional scientific discipline [4].
Arguably natural history’s salvation lies in better use
(reuse) of the underlying data.
Meaningful forecasting and sustainable use of biotic
resources requires large volumes of primary biodiversity
data. However, this leaves informaticians with the
challenge of integrating data from numerous, disparate
natural history data providers, each with their own
specific user communities, and diverse data types and
sources, including taxonomic names and concepts,
specimens in museum collections, scientific publications, genomic and phenotypic data, and images [5].
One approach is to data-mine existing publications in an
attempt to reverse engineer scholarly publications into a
database [6]. This approach is arguably the only option

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S14/S6

for legacy natural history data. But for new information,
or that which has never been formally published, such
reverse engineering should not be required so long as a
technical, social and policy framework for data publication can be found. This paper is about the creation of a
data-publishing framework for natural history.
Data publication is a new sort of scholarship that
involves construction of large-scale datasets whose
governance, organisation and use can be implemented
using the web as a platform for generating, repurposing,
and using data [7]. These systems offer the possibility of
radical new ways of conducting scholarship and challenge some established ideas of how particular disciplines operate. To facilitate reuse and repurposing of
data, these systems embrace ‘Open Science’ - the
proposition of a model of communication inspired by
the Free/Open Source software and Creative Commons
movement [8]. A central theme of Open Science is to
make clear accounts of the methodology, along with
data and results extracted therein, freely available via the
Web. This permits a massively distributed collaboration.
Design concerns relevant to data publication frameworks
include the successful management of large scale distributed research programmes, how to support networks
of independent researchers, the management of
individual research careers, the development of new
inter-disciplinary collaborations, and engagement with
non-scholarly communities as both producers and consumers of research. These concerns are highly relevant to
the challenges facing natural history scientists [4]. From a
technical perspective these systems involve the development of tools for sharing natural history data, building
and maintaining collaborations both formally and
informally, and managing workflow and outputs.
A defining feature of data publication frameworks is that
they primarily rely on social information flows, motivations and relations to organise the group. Individuals
self-identify, mostly, for tasks, and through a variety of
peer-review mechanisms contributions are recognised by
the group and incorporated into what emerges as the
collaborative output. A feature critical to their success is
the ability of the framework to be broken down into
discrete modules, capable of independent completion in
relatively fine-grained increments. Because of this,
people can contribute a little or a lot depending upon
their motivations, such that some combination of ‘true
believers’, occasional contributors, and people paid to
participate can sustain a project.
In this paper we describe the system architecture and
template design of “Scratchpads”, a data-publishing

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10(Suppl 14):S6

framework for groups of people to create their own
social networks supporting natural history science. This
infrastructure is a combination of databases, network
protocols and computational services that brings people,
information and computational tools together to perform and publish natural history. Our goal was to build
a system that could motivate individual researchers in
the generation, management and dissemination of their
own data for their own needs, while empowering a wider
constituent of potential users who are free to repurpose
this information for other uses.

Implementation
Design considerations and related work
Standard tools can be designed for the codification and
dissemination of data and knowledge for communities
with standard practices. But in cutting-edge disciplines,
those spanning multiple specialities, or where standards
are nascent and cannot be well defined, developing a
common approach can be extremely difficult. Natural
history science has all these challenging criteria. Natural
history scientists work in fragmented, highly distributed
and parochial communities, each with domain specific
requirements and methodologies [9]. Their output is
heterogeneous, high volume and typically of low impact,
but with a citation half-life that may run into centuries.
This output (e.g. species descriptions) broadly conform to
a power law (long-tail) distribution where the least
regularly accessed content accounts for more than half
of the total and is proportionally more important than
the smaller fraction of more regularly accessed (popular)
content. Consequently a high level and flexible approach
to developing the software and workflow is needed,
covering broad subjects and themes in order to encourage
adoption by a range of natural history scientists.

Fundamental to the design was the need to build a truly
scalable and flexible data publishing framework accessible through a web browser that supports 1) large
numbers of users as passive readers and active contributors; 2) editorial hierarchies serving individual and
community needs; 3) the epistemological richness and
diversity of all contributors; 4) flexible data models that
can be modified or added by contributors; 5) automated
integration of third party content; 6) automated semantic
enrichment of contributed and third party content; 7)
content workflows and curation tools; 8) content archival
and citation; 9) content licensing and a conditions of use
framework; 10) web services; and 11) ease of use.
Within the context of natural history science, some
websites and services meet many of these needs across
specific data types (e.g. TreeBASE for phylogenetic trees
[10], Catalogue of Life for taxonomic names [11], GBIF

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S14/S6

for biological occurrence records [12]), or most of these
data needs across narrow taxonomic domains (e.g.,
FishBase for fish [13], Avibase for birds [14], AmphibiaWeb for amphibians [15]). Arguably, though, none of
these systems scale to the breadth of all taxonomic
diversity for all natural history data types. Indeed most
limit their scope in order to place some practical
boundary on their development, and to simplify the
process of establishing credibility within their chosen
domain. Further, these systems all struggle to accommodate conflicting or alternative hypotheses about data.
Natural history science is well known for its epistemological richness and diversity [16]. It is difficult, if not
impossible, to find researchers completely agreeing with
each other within and between domains (e.g. in the
taxonomic classification or phylogenetic relations of
particular taxa). Electronic systems that force contributors to adopt a single representation of a particular data
set (e.g. a single taxonomic hierarchy for navigating
data) risk disenfranchising potential contributors, often
to the exclusion of their data and interpretations.
To address these design requirements and social challenges the Scratchpads consist of a loosely coupled
platform for publishing natural history research that
enables contributors to build, share, and manage data
with minimal barriers beyond our highly generic design
constraints. We accommodate epistemological diversity
and the problem of establishing trust within natural
history domains by enabling contributors to create
independent sites whose purpose, destiny and brand
rest in the hands of the contributing community. These
communities are often well established and have a
strong sense of purpose. Nevertheless, our software
platform “Scratchpads” needed to establish credibility
and trust across natural history science domains. This
was achieved by basing the project at the Natural History
Museum (NHM), London, and managing the project
through the European Distributed Institute of Taxonomy
(EDIT). The NHM has a well-established brand as a
world leader in natural history research, while EDIT is a
network of 28 leading European, North American and
Russian institutions specialising in natural history. This
structure was intended to minimise individual and
institutional rivalries that might jeopardise the longterm sustainability of the project. Thus supporting our
goal of creating an open community resource for natural
history.
The unusual nature of this project demands agile
development methodologies to promote frequent
inspection and adaptation of the software in response
to user needs [17]. Throughout this ongoing process we
are mindful that our approach must be generic enough
to scale to the widest constituent of possible users. Short

development cycles and informal project management,
sometimes spanning hours to generate several iterations
of a feature in reciprocal response to user feedback,
makes traditional documentation and planning difficult.
However, our experience suggests this leads to software
that better meets user needs, and fosters a community of
developers and users that arguably builds a path toward
long-term sustainability.

Architecture and workflow
Rather than expand the taxonomic or content scope of
an existing system supporting natural history science, we
decided that a more generic solution would be required
that could be tailored in a sustainable way toward the
bespoke needs of natural history scientists. Content
Management describes the set of processes and technologies that support the evolutionary life cycle of digital
information. Content Management Systems (CMS) can
provide generic informatics solutions for web publication of content created by individuals acting alone, or
within organisations and research communities of
almost any size. These tools aid in managing the
development of software, collaborations, documents
and websites. They are highly extensible and can be
developed to support other research-specific activities
such as handling large distributed datasets, data visualisation and analytical tools [18]. The emphasis of CMS
tools on instant (web) publication and content maintenance, allows contributors to focus on content development, instead of administration.

Our decision to adapt an existing CMS for managing
biodiversity data is a significant departure from the
conventional approach employed within the biodiversity
informatics community. Traditionally this involves developing customised database models, usually after extensive mapping and observation of the target user
community, followed by the development of a bespoke
software application that formalizes workflows and
processes. A current high profile example of this approach
is the Common Data Model (CDM) [19], which is in
development by EDIT Workpackage 5 [20]. This is
intended to provide a generic data model and service
framework for bespoke biodiversity applications that are
collectively referred to as the “CyberPlatform” [21].
Another high profile example is CATE (Creating A
Taxonomic E-science) [22], which augments the CDM
library and server with additional logic to present the data
as web pages and in a workflow geared toward revisionary
taxonomy. In our experience the challenge with these and
similar bespoke biodiversity applications is threefold:
1. The data types, structures and workflows modelled
within these systems typically do not capture the full

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S14/S6

gamut of data and practices engaged in by the wider
user community. Consequently, take up amongst the
potential pool of candidate users may be low beyond
those surveyed, because the transaction costs for
users engaging with systems that do not meet the full
spectrum of their needs is too high. For example,
biodiversity informatics applications often assume
data held by users is more structured, and therefore
more readily modelled within a database, or structured differently than it typically is. The effort
(transaction cost) required by users to sufficiently
structure (or restructure) their data is too high,
relative to their perceived benefit from using the
system.
2. The relationship between content (text, images,
video, data etc) and context (layout presentation,
branding, ownership, identity, audience etc) is
crucial to understanding how and why users engage
with information technology systems. This textography (sensu Swales [23,24]) is crucial to scholarly
discourse, but is challenging to accommodate in
biodiversity informatics systems that usually disarticulate the process of capturing content (e.g. the act of
populating a database) from content presentation
(e.g. a the display of a formatted database query on a
webpage).
3. The heterogeneity of biodiversity data, coupled
with multiple small, niche user communities, often
with distinct needs and different audiences, requires
highly bespoke informatics solutions. These are
expensive and challenging to sustain, and usually
lack a clear business model beyond intermittent
cycles of grant funding.
Our reason for adopting a CMS as a platform rather than
building a bespoke application was to directly address
these challenges. The ‘content’ in CMS is typically loosely
defined and can be accommodated in various ways, from
highly unstructured ‘pages’ or nodes, through to highly
structured normalized datasets. This provides the flexibility necessary to accommodate use cases that were not
originally envisaged at the outset of the project. CMS
minimize the distinction between the organization of
content and its final presentation. This helps the content
provider visualise how content will be presented to their
audience without having to second-guess how an
informatician will re-present content on their behalf.
Finally, generic CMS systems are used extensively in
many scholarly and non-scholarly settings and support a
range of generic functionality that is required by all webbased applications regardless of the size or purpose of
the userbase. Developer communities writing the underlying CMS software are completely independent and
several orders of magnitude larger than the niche
informatics communities working to support taxonomy

and systematics. This gives generic CMS software much
greater sustainability than bespoke biodiversity applications written by very small number of developers, which
are supported by intermittent research grants. Building on
top of a CMS removes the burden of having to develop
generic functionality common to all applications (e.g.
user management and content versioning) allowing
developers to focus on specialised functionality that
directly meets the needs of the target user community.
CMS are usually built on top of content management
frameworks (CMF) and open source programming
languages. Many CMS tools exist [25] but the top four
based on a recent study [26] include one written in
Python, Plone [27], founded on the Zope CMF; and
three written in PHP: WordPress [28], a commonly used
blogging platform; Joomla [29], widely recognised for its
ease of use; and Drupal [30], commonly used in multiuser collaborative sites. For the Scratchpad project we
selected Drupal because it offers a good balance between
the sophistication and ease of use required for managing
large and distributed user communities. Crucially Drupal
met 6 of the 11 design criteria that were identified in the
previous section. The variety of contributed Drupal
modules (currently over 7,000), size of the userbase
(including several Fortune 500 [31] companies, major
universities and government agencies), and ready supply
of developers thanks to the popularity of PHP, were all
contributing factors in our decision. In principle the
Scratchpad project could however, be replicated in any of
the top four CMS.
The Scratchpad project was founded on Drupal version 5
in March 2007, although an ongoing transition to
Drupal 6 means that as of June 2009 sites are being
upgraded. The Scratchpad server’s operating system is
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL 5) running Apache 2.2
with PHP 5.1.6 and the database backend is MySQL
5.0.45. The Scratchpad project can, however, be run on
any operating system, web server and database that
supports PHP and Drupal. We are running a single
Apache virtual host for all Scratchpad instances with
Drupal handling domain names in a standard Drupal
multisite configuration. This means that all sites share a
common codebase but have their own database and
database user, controlling data access on a site-by-site
basis. User uploads are also segregated to independent
folders to improve site security and facilitate site-by-site
mobility, archival and backup. Drupal provides the
foundations for basic web publication including the
ability to register and maintain individual user accounts,
administration menus, RSS-feeds, customisable layout,
flexible account privileges, logging, a blogging system,
and an Internet forum. The Scratchpads build on this

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S14/S6

through a combination of 42 modules provided by the
Drupal community and 29 modules developed within
the Scratchpad project (See Additional file 1: Modules
for a complete list). The latter provide a suite of
specifically adapted tools to support natural history
scientists and their data.
New sites are initiated at the behest of a potential user,
who registers interest and accepts responsibility for the
new site, through a form on the Scratchpad website
http://scratchpads.eu/apply. Users supply their biographic details and information on their proposed use
of the site, in addition to a Google Map API (Application
Programming Interface) key that activates the Scratchpad
geolocative features. Upon submission of the completed
form, the site approval and creation process is initiated.
Currently the Scratchpad project accepts all sites within
the domain of natural history, even if their proposed
subject overlaps that of a current site. Site creation is
semi-automated and is controlled through a Drupal
installation profile that specifies standardised Scratchpad
settings, administrative users, modules, permissions, and
establishes the site so that it is immediately accessible to
the registrant. Registrants receive e-mail notification of
their new site and are assigned the role of site
maintainer, granting them administrative permissions
that include the ability to assign new users as additional
maintainers, editors or contributors. These roles control
user actions through a cascading hierarchy of permissions. Contributors are restricted to authoring and
editing their own content, editors can author and edit
any content, while maintainers also have certain administrative privileges. Scratchpad project administrators
have full administrative control from an account hidden
to other users. A click through agreement ensures that
each user agrees to a set of terms and conditions that
outline their rights and responsibilities through use of
the site http://scratchpads.eu/TermsAndConditions.
These terms are ultimately arbitrated by the Scratchpad
administrators who reserve the right to review, refuse,
monitor, edit or remove any content.
Content is added to a Scratchpad through a flexible
workflow (Figure 1) that is optimised if one or more
ontologies (e.g. a biological taxonomic hierarchy) are
imported into the site first. These ontologies provide a
structure around which content can automatically be
tagged (i.e. classified), and facilitate search and browse
functionality. Scratchpad users do not have to follow this
workflow when publishing content, although the
absence of matching terms (e.g. taxon names) in an
uploaded ontology will disable features that dynamically
aggregate tagged content (e.g. Taxon pages), making this
information harder to navigate.

Scratchpad workflow. Users independently submit content in Drupal nodes and vocabularies of terms (e.g. biological
classifications of taxon names) associated with content. Nodes are grouped into content types (e.g. images, DNA sequences,
phylogenetic trees, GBIF maps etc), each of which has specific workflows for data entry and editing. Terms from a vocabulary
(e.g. taxon names) common to nodes are used to semantically enrich (tag) content on submission. Tagged nodes can be
represented in predefined views according to their content type, and are dynamically aggregated on term pages (e.g. taxon
pages) that can be navigated through their vocabulary. Intuitive curation tools allow users to select which nodes to display on
term pages. This model provides a highly generic solution to submitting, grouping, enriching, and navigating diverse data types.

Vocabularies
Drupal supports the use of multiple restricted vocabularies as flat lists of terms, single hierarchies, or multiple
hierarchies. We have adapted this system to support the
import, export and management of biological classifications through a series of modules. They allow Drupal to
support very large hierarchies of a potentially unlimited
number of terms; improve the term editing and management interface; and provide the means to store additional term metadata. By default all hierarchical
classifications are stored as parent-child relations within
the site database. However, performance issues make this
very inefficient for classifications with large numbers of
terms. In instances where classifications contain more
than one thousand terms, the hierarchy is additionally
stored using a nested set algorithm [32]. This is

implemented in a module http://drupal.org/project/
leftandright/ that has been tested with classifications
exceeding two million terms without encountering
notable performance degradation.
Drupal allows users to create multiple vocabularies that
must be linked with appropriate content types before
they can be used. This permits users to associate content
with multiple, and potentially competing, classifications.
Terms can be added to a vocabulary within a Scratchpad
on a term-by-term basis through an editing interface, or
en masse, either via a tab delimited text file that has been
exported from a Spreadsheet template http://scratchpads.eu/taxonomytemplate, or through a web service
provided by the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) project [33].
The latter enables users to import all child terms within a

Page 6 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10(Suppl 14):S6

hierarchy from one of a selection of published biological
classifications. This service supplies terms and associated
metadata (authority, rank and synonymy) in an RDF
representation of the Taxonomic Concept Schema [34].
Hierarchy management and term (taxon name) modification is supported for biological classification
through an editor that enables intuitive (drag and
drop) manipulation of terms and sections of hierarchies.
This was developed in partnership with the Encyclopedia
of Life project [33] and allows users to build new
classifications using sections of classifications that have
been previously created (i.e via drag and drop editing).
The tool also allows users to associate term names with
their protologue, i.e. the bibliographic reference of the
original taxon description.

Content types
Drupal stores content in nodes which are instances of
content types, each of which may have bespoke workflows for data import, export, editing and visualization.
Certain generic content types (e.g. pages, blog entries,
fora) are defined within the core of Drupal. More
specialized content types are defined through modules
that are tailored to the particular demands of different
data. The Scratchpads use a combination of contributed
modules (i.e. those provided by members of the Drupal
developers community) and modules written by members of the Scratchpad developers group. When a module
developed within the Scratchpad project is sufficiently
robust and of generic use to other Drupal users, it is
released to the Drupal community via the Drupal
website under an open source licence.

Bibliography
A contributed module http://drupal.org/project/biblio
that allows users to manage and display lists of scholarly
publications. As part of the Scratchpad project we use
this as a stand alone content type in addition to
integrating this into the workflow for managing bibliographic metadata associated with taxonomic names and
specimens records. Features of the bibliography module
include the ability to import reference lists in BibTeX,
RIS, MARC, EndNote tagged and XML formats, and
export lists in BibTeX, EndNote tagged and XML formats.
The module allows users to format references in multiple
styles and supports in-line citation of references. This
function is currently one of the most popular features
within the Scratchpads, supporting 37,204 nodes
across 37 sites. Users can upload PDF files of articles to
create discipline specific bibliographies relevant to
natural history. Current Scratchpad bibliographies
include examples on fossil insects http://fossilinsects.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S14/S6

editwebrevisions.info/biblio and fungus gnats http://
sciaroidea.info/bibliography.
Blog entry
A blog entry is a single post to an online diary or journal.
This is a core content type within Drupal. Users can
create multiple blogs within a site that are linked to
terms within a restricted vocabulary. A good example
containing multi-authored blog entries can be found on
the Wallace Fund Website http://wallacefund.info/blogs.
Character project
This node type allows users to build and manage a
matrix of controlled, text or numeric characters associated with selected taxa. This matrix has the appearance
of a spreadsheet, and can be used to build morphological or molecular datasets for phylogenetic analysis,
identification keys and printed character lists or descriptions. On initiating a character project, users select taxa
from one of any vocabulary present within their site
using a hierarchical select list. Taxa may be hierarchically
arranged within the matrix according to their classification, with an option for parent taxa to inherit the
properties (character states) of their children, or arranged
as a simple flat list. New characters are added to the
character project at the behest of the user, who can
choose between three character types. These are controlled characters, which limit character state choices to a
restricted list provided by the user, e.g. molecular DNA
bases; text characters which allow unrestricted textual
input such as a verbose description of a particular
morphological feature; and numeric characters, which
allow whole integer or decimal input e.g. measurements.
Characters can be added to character groups and can be
reordered in a drag and drop fashion to facilitate the
rapid creation and collection of character data. Users
enter character states directly into the character grid,
which are validated according to the type and controls
specified when the character was created. Character
projects use the SlickGrid jQuery plugin [35] that is
incorporated into our character editor (nexus) module to
provide the grid interface.
Countries map
This node type is used for displaying maps of the world
highlighting selected countries. It is intended for use in
displaying the presence or absence of taxa from
particular countries, when more precise geolocative
data is unavailable. Users select geographic regions
from a list hierarchically organised around the TDWG
geographic region ontology (levels 1-4) [36] to produce
distribution maps of taxa. This module uses polygons
corresponding to country outlines generated though a

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10(Suppl 14):S6

service provided by EDIT [37], which are overlayed onto
a world base map presented in the Mercator projection.
Custom content types
Users can customise content types to their bespoke needs
using the contributed Content Construction Kit (CCK)
http://drupal.org/project/cck. The module is not a
content type in itself, but allows users to create content
types. CCK provides an intuitive interface for users to
augment predefined content types (i.e. add new fields)
or create new content types. Users first define a set of
fields that become part of a table within the Scratchpad
site database. Data can then be selectively imported into
the table from a tab-delimited spreadsheet. This is done
with the aid of an intuitive interface that guides users
through the process of matching column headers from
the spreadsheet with fields in the content type. Data can
then be imported en masse, and visualised in userdefined presentations with the views and taxon page
interface (see below). To date Scratchpad users have
created custom content types for diverse data sets that
could not have been anticipated by the Scratchpad
development team, or supported because of its niche
relevance to a particular subject domain. In many cases
predefined standards for these obscure natural history
data types do not exist. Examples include a checklist of
cockroach cultures currently being held in captivity by
members of the Blattoidea culture group http://blattodea-culture-group.org/en/culturelist and descriptions of
mosquito morphology (e.g. http://mosquito-taxonomicinventory.info/en/genus-emlutziaem-theobald-1903).
Forum topic
A forum topic is the initial post to a new discussion
thread within a forum and is a core content type within
Drupal. The default profile of each Scratchpad includes a
forum that users can customise. All users with login
authentication can initiate and contribute to a forum.
Fora can be linked to an e-mail account into which user
can receive posted messages. An example of an active
forum within the Scratchpads can be found on the
Araceae Network Scratchpad (see http://scratchpad.catearaceae.org/forum).
Group
Groups enable users to manage and control access to
collections of content by adding content or other users to
a group. This enables sub-communities to exist within a
Scratchpad site, allowing site members to self-organise
around public or private topics of interest, such as the
production of scientific content for a research project. A
group is created by a single group owner that has special
permissions, including the ability to delete the group.
Group subscribers communicate amongst themselves

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S14/S6

using the group home page as a focal point. Users can
establish private groups that will not be displayed in the
groups list, and groups may be selective, requiring users
to be approved by the group administrator before
becoming a member. Groups are defined through the
Organic Groups contributed module http://drupal.org/
project/og.

Image
The upload and display of images is defined through a
contributed module http://drupal.org/project/image that
we have incorporated into a workflow through a second
module http://drupal.org/project/imagex. This supports
the mass upload and display of images. Users can drag
and drop collections of images in most formats including BMP, JPEG, TIFF, and PNG files, on to an open
source applet [38] that will upload the pictures. Image
thumbnails are dynamically created on upload. Users
can select images on to which they can apply annotations en masse via the matrix editor (described below).
All annotations are optional, and by default users can
specify a title and gallery name from where the images
will be accessible. Users can also apply keywords and
details of preparation and imaging techniques. These are
drawn from a restricted vocabulary defined within the
Scratchpad that can be augmented by the user. For
images of biological specimens users can optionally
apply specimen and location information as defined by
the Darwin Core standard [39]. Images can also be
associated with publications through integration of this
workflow with the bibliographic module. Licences
specifying how images can be used can be applied
through the Creative Commons module http://drupal.
org/project/creativecommons_lite. Once uploaded,
images and their annotations can be browsed through
in an image gallery. This is a contributed module that
allows users to group and organise collections of
uploaded images. Galleries can be hierarchically
arranged and include a weighting feature to control
their placement on a page. Thumbnails of the first image
within a gallery are dynamically created when an image
is uploaded.

iSpecies Cache
This is an administrative content type that holds copies
of third party content drawn from external services. It is
used as part of the taxon page display where content is
dynamically created around terms held in a site
vocabulary (see below) and is hidden to non-administrative users. Many third party web services serving
natural history data are fragile or slow to load. Caching
this content reduces load time for users. The module is
named in homage to Roderic D.M. Page’s iSpecies

website [40] that generates “on the fly” pages of species
information.

termites http://termites.myspecies.info/en/content/bayesian-global-tree-termites.

Location (DwC 1.2.1)
A location record conforms to Darwin Core 1.2.1 fields
[39] and can be used independently or in association
with the specimen record content type. This is integrated
within the workflow for annotating specimen records.
Examples of Scratchpads that use this content type
include sites on macrostomorph flatworms http://
macrostomorpha.info/ and flies http://diptera.myspecies.info/. The module allows users to specify a point
location by clicking on a Google Map and dragging the
location marker. The interface also supports the textual
input of geolocative data matching the Darwin Core
1.2.1 standard, including information on elevation and
depth.

Poll
Polls are questions with a set of limited responses.
Authorised users can create a poll and invite other users
to vote on the responses. Once created, polls automatically provide a running count of the number of votes
received for each response. This is a Drupal core content
type.

Newsletter issue
This contributed module http://drupal.org/project/simplenews publishes and sends newsletters to lists of
subscribers. Newsletter issues are essentially e-mail
messages that are stored within the site and associated
with different newsletters through a list held by the
taxonomy module. Users can edit this list to create new
newsletters and users can subscribe to a newsletter
within their user account page.
Page
A page is the simplest content type for creating and
displaying information. Pages contain no predefined
structure and are most appropriately used for content
(i.e. text and images) that rarely change, such as an
“About us” section of a website. The main field of the
page can be optionally used with a WYSIWYG editor
provided through the contributed WYSIWYG module
http://drupal.org/project/wysiwyg. This provides an API
that supports third party editors as plugins, simplifying
the administrative process of adding and changing the
editor. Currently we use the TinyMCE editor [41] across
the Scratchpads.
Phylogenetic tree
This module is based on Roderic D.M. Page’s tree
viewing widget (TVWidget) that displays very large
phylogenetic trees to a constrained and predefined size.
The widget [42] has been wrapped within a Drupal
module called Tree and allows users to paste or upload
a Newick tree description or Nexus file containing a
Newick formatted phylogeny. The module creates a page
that displays the widget. Examples of very large
phylogenies displayed in Scratchpads through this
module include trees on Dung beetles http://dungbeetle.co.uk/en/content/adapted-monaghan-et-al-2007 and

Specimen (DwC 1.2.1)
Specimen records are based on the Darwin Core version
1.2.1 fields [39]. This content type allows users to record
biological specimens through a tabbed workflow and is
linked with the location Darwin Core content type. An
example of a site that uses this facility is a Scratchpad on
Freeloader flies http://milichiidae.info/en/specimenlist.
Nodes
All content is stored in Drupal nodes which minimally
have a unique URL, title, creator and last edited/created
times, in addition to any supplementary fields defined
by the content type. Each node is given a numeric
identifier that is addressable within the database and
forms part of the URL. This identifier always links to the
most recent version of a node if its content is modified.
However, all previous versions of content are stored and
can be accessed through a permanent URL. A URL alias is
created from the title of the node that is supplied by the
author. This alphanumeric alias is usually more intuitive
than the numeric node identifier and can be customised
by authorised users. However, the numeric node
identifier cannot be changed and is persistent and
unique within a site. When appended to the sites
domain name this acts as a Globally Unique Identifier
(GUID) that addresses node content. Optionally, each
node can be tagged with one or more terms from a
vocabulary allowing content to be searched and aggregated through these terms. At the base of every node a
range of options are presented to the user that include
menu settings (to attach nodes to a menu block),
publishing options (to publish or unpublish a node,
promote it to the sites front page and allow it to sit at the
top of a list), comment settings (to enable or disable
comments) and file attachments (to attach one or more
files to the node).

All Drupal nodes can be translated through the
contributed internationalisation package. This consists
of a collection of modules that provide a translation
interface for the creation of comprehensive multilingual
sites including node content, taxonomies and menu
items. Working in conjunction with browser language

Page 9 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10(Suppl 14):S6

detection this will redirect users to content displayed in
their preferred translation and includes a block for
language selection. At present only one site on stick
insects - the Phasmid Study Group http://phasmidstudy-group.org/en/ has made use of this facility.
Semantic enrichment (tagging)
New or modified nodes are automatically searched upon
submission to identify terms that match those present in
any vocabularies associated with the node content type.
If one or more terms match, the user is presented with an
interface that enables them to select which term/s to
associate with the node. These features are provided by
the autotag module http://drupal.org/project/autotag
that supports terms from multiple independent vocabularies, even if the term name is common to two or
more vocabularies. Terms located in a node are preselected in the interface to enable fast and efficient
tagging. The interface also facilitates tagging with terms
that are not present within the node. Term name autocompletion, which includes references to the source
vocabulary (i.e. classification), speeds up the input of
additional term name tags.
Blocks and views
Blocks and views are a means to create boxes of related/
grouped data that can be built to create aggregations of
content from multiple node types. Blocks are normally
used in the left and/or right sidebar(s) of a site and are a
core feature of the Drupal CMS. Views is a contributed
module that acts as a powerful query builder. This allows
users to fetch and present highly customised lists, tables
and other visualisations. Detailed descriptions of blocks
and views can be found in the Drupal handbook http://
drupal.org/handbooks. Here we focus on how we have
used these features within the Scratchpad project.

The Scratchpad profile specifies a series of blocks for the
left and right sidebars including a ClustrMap [43] that
shows the location of site visitors; a tabbed search block
that allows users to switch between free text searches of
the entire site, and filtered searches based on an auto
completed list of taxon names stored within the site
vocabulary; an ‘about this site’ block providing brief
background information supplied during the Scratchpad
signup process; and a user log-on block. Once logged in
the log-on block is replaced with an administrative menu
and a ‘Create Content’ block providing direct links to
major site features.
The default data views created by the Scratchpad profile
on creation of a site include views for each content type
including data from third party sources. These are
customised to the particular needs of each data source.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S14/S6

For example, bibliographic data are displayed in a table
that can be sorted by author, year and publication title;
images are displayed as a list of thumbnails; Wikipedia
content is displayed as the first block of text before the
first header; and GBIF occurrence maps are simply
embedded within the view. Users can also create Google
Map views displaying geolocative data with the GMaps
module. This allows nodes containing georeferenced
data to be filtered and plotted on a Google Map. By
default Google Maps are created for all nodes with
geolocative information, and all users who have specified their location in their user profile.
A view of nodes and their associated fields is dynamically created for each content type (including user
defined CCK content types) and works in conjunction
with a grid matrix editor we have created for spreadsheetlike data entry. This allows users to edit data en masse,
where each row represents a node (web page) and each
column represents a field in the content type. Data in
each field is validated according to the same controls
that would be present if it were being edited within a
single node. The matrix editor allows users to rapidly
edit large datasets in an intuitive spreadsheet like
environment.

Taxon pages
Taxonomic names provide a central link between diverse
items of information about an organism. Given an
organism’s scientific name a wide range of data can be
drawn together, including content from third party
databases that have a suitable API. Scratchpad taxon
pages are our attempt to allow users to dynamically
construct and curate pages of information (e.g. phenotypic, genomic, images, specimens, geographic distribution) about any taxon regardless of the physical location
of the source data. These pages can include information
contained within a Scratchpad and data drawn from
selected third party resources.

Taxon pages are built around the biological classifications that users have created within their sites, and can
be intuitively navigated through the taxon hierarchy
block, created with the TinyTax module http://drupal.
org/project/tinytax. Because content may be inappropriately tagged with a taxon name, especially if it is drawn
from a third party source, taxon pages include curation
tools allowing users to select which content to display,
and how this is arranged on a page. This is achieved
through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface that supports the curation of the major categories of information
to be displayed, and the detailed content within these
categories. By default, content is dynamically aggregated
on a taxon page in an order that represents the most

Page 10 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10(Suppl 14):S6

recent information for any given category. Users can fix
content on a taxon page using simple view controls that
hide inappropriate content and force the display of
particularly pertinent information that is likely to remain
relevant. For example, users may select holotype and
paratype specimen records to be displayed first, followed
by a list of the most recently collected specimens. These
controls operate on data regardless of whether content is
drawn locally or sourced from a third party, allowing
taxon pages to display a combination of fixed and recent
information as selected by the curator.
An ‘on-demand’ citation feature allows users to create
permanent snapshots of an entire taxon page, whose
content will never change and will reside at a permanent
URL. Buttons to request the creation of a citable version
are placed at the bottom of each taxon page. When
pressed these display a copy of the citation information
including the URL and a Chicago style bibliographic
reference to the archived taxon page. An option to send
the citation data to the user as an e-mail is also
presented. This citation feature is available to users as a
Drupal block, making on-demand citation possible for
all Scratchpad content on any node.
Taxon pages are built through a combination of blocks and
views that are predefined by Scratchpad modules. Users can
create new blocks and views of data that are available to the
taxon pages, allowing users to customise this feature to their
bespoke needs. Programmatically, taxon pages are defined
through a series of modules that facilitate the sorting,
caching and citation of content. In Drupal 6 sites these are
brought together through the “Mado” module http://
drupal.org/project/mado that integrates the required modules and lays out the taxon page. This replaces our
implementation of the Panels module http://drupal.org/
project/panels used in Drupal 5 sites.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S14/S6

Third-party content
The international scope and interdisciplinary content of
natural history means that most natural history data are
presently distributed in thousands of public and private
databases worldwide. Given a shared identifier and a
suitable API, information from these databases can be
integrated into taxon pages within a Scratchpad. These
pages rely on taxon names as a shared identifier.
However, the instability of taxon names (e.g. due to
synonymy) coupled with the fact that they are not
globally unique (e.g. due to homonymy) mean that
taxon names do not always refer to the same entity. We
rely on the taxon page curation tools available to users to
address this problem.

There is no sustainable way of addressing the lack of an
API for most natural history databases. Consequently we
focus our efforts on the major data providers that,
because of their size, scope and/or quality, have well
specified API’s and have become part of the scholarly
communication process for natural history scientists. A
list of current third party data providers accessible to
Scratchpad users is given in Table 1. Adding new services
requires an API that takes a taxon name as the search
term. The return is processed and put into a list of results
that is passed to the iSpecies module. The latter displays
the results within a Drupal view which is processed
within a bespoke module for each service. New services
can be quickly and easily added given a data source with
an appropriate API.
Services
We provide a limited range of services on Scratchpad
data. At present these are restricted to specimen and
bibliographic data. However, Scratchpad users can create
bespoke views of their data in XML format that can be
accessed by others. This is achieved with the views

module by specifying XML output and can be created by
any user with appropriate permissions (currently site
editors, maintainers and the Scratchpad administrators).
A service on specimen data is provided by TapirLink
software [44] external to the Scratchpads. TapirLink uses
each set of Scratchpad database specimen records as
a data source. These data fit the DarwinCore v1.2.1
standard [39] allowing TapirLink to serve denormalized
specimen data to interested partied including GBIF [12].
At present users have the option of having this service
switched on.
Bibliographic data are currently available from the
Scratchpads in BibTeX or Endnote format. BibTeX data
is currently harvested by Falx [45], a bibliographic data
harvester that is part of ViTaL (the Virtual Taxonomic
Library), that aggregates bibliographic data from various
sources including the Scratchpads to provide an integrated search interface for taxonomic literature of
relevance to natural history research scientists (e.g.
http://taxonlib.org/bibsearch?term=caves). We also
expose bibliographic data using the OAI-PMH (Open
Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting)
module [46]. This provides an OAI-PMH version 2
interface to bibliographic data held by the bibliography
module within any Scratchpad. We plan to evaluate the
use of OAI-PMH as a more generic solution for serving
all data from the Scratchpads in due course.
Support
The Scratchpad project is constantly evolving in response
to users needs, under the programming mantra “release
early, release often”. Through regular user feedback,
features undergo several revisions in a very short space of
time. This pace of change makes traditional documentation (e.g. user manuals) difficult. The energy involved in
producing traditional documentation often exceeds the
likely benefit to users, since a described feature is often
out of date before the majority of users realised the
feature was present. To address this challenge we needed
a modular user guide that could be quickly revised to
reflect recent development. This was done using an
e-Book within the Scratchpad website that contains a
series of help screencasts outlining the functions and
day-to-day operation of the site. These screencasts can be
constructed quickly and slotted into the existing e-Book
structure. To date almost 100 screencasts amounting to
more than 8 hours worth of video are available to users
(see http://scratchpads.eu/screencasts). In addition, we
have constructed a support forum http://scratchpads.eu/
forum, FAQ list http://scratchpads.eu/faqs and Sandbox
http://sandbox.scratchpads.eu/ that rebuilds itself every
hour, allowing users to explore the functionality of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S14/S6

Scratchpad project. If all else fails, users can e-mail us for
assistance at support@scratchpads.eu.
Administration
Administrative tasks within the Scratchpad can be
accessed through the Drupal Administration page. By
default users are presented with a simplified version of
this page that hides most of the advanced or less well
used administrative functions. The majority of Scratchpad users do not need access to the administrative
components of the site, and many of these features are
restricted to site maintainers. Here we will only consider
Drupal administrative features that we have customised
for the Scratchpads.

Drupal supports OpenID [47] and we have created our
own OpenID identity provider http://edit-openid.eu/
that allows us to provide users with OpenID identities.
Our use of OpenID enables users to logon to multiple
Scratchpads and other OpenID enabled websites with a
single username and password. Users can specify OpenIDs from any identity providers in their user profile.
From our implementation of Drupal version 6 we have
customised the Scratchpad user profile to include a
default set of fields that include the user’s academic
affiliation and domain of taxonomic expertise. These
fields can be further customised by site maintainers to
include additional fields relevant to the bespoke needs
of the site.
Natural history researchers generally rely on social, and
not financial motivations to contribute content. Consequently customised branding to establish group identity
is important to the success of many sites. Drupal’s core
features support branding, allowing authorized users to
customise the site title, slogan and mission statement, in
addition to uploading a logo and adjusting the theme
that controls the sites colour scheme and page layout.
Drupal themes are usually implemented with Cascading
Style Sheets (CSS) and a wide range of themes can be
downloaded from the Drupal website http://drupal.org/
project/Themes. Within the Scratchpad project these
functions are restricted to site maintainers, and accessed
through the site information and theme pages within the
advanced administration section of a site. By default,
new Scratchpads are created with the multi-column,
fluid width Garland theme that can be re-coloured using
an intuitive colour picker. Maintainers can switch
between a selection of compatible themes with a range
of layouts and styles we have pre-selected for the
Scratchpads. However, users cannot upload additional
themes to their site. In practice most Scratchpad users
accept the default layout settings and prioritise content
creation over refined issues of site design and

Page 12 of 16

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10(Suppl 14):S6

navigation. Consequently non-members may consider
that many Scratchpads look inelegant or are difficult to
navigate. These design and content-building aspects are
part of the process by which members establish their
sense of identity and community: a similar phenomena
can be seen on many social networking websites e.g.
MySpace[48].
Customised themes and workflows could be developed
to promote good design and site navigation, while
retaining the high level of flexibility needed by users to
establish a sense of community identity. At present the
only design restriction that is pragmatically enforced is
the presence of a small footer, forced at the base of every
Scratchpad page. This contains logos for EDIT, the
Scratchpads, Creative Commons, and the Drupal CMS,
each of which link to their respective projects with the
exception of the Creative Commons logo. The latter
currently links through to version three of an unported
(i.e. international) Creative Commons license [49] that
defines how content on the node can be used. By default
this license permits non-commercial use by attribution,
with the proviso that subsequent use of the content is
covered by the same Creative Commons license.
The Scratchpad server is backed up using IBM’s Tivoli
Storage Manager [50], which archives the last seven
versions of any file contained within the system. These
archives are stored on tape, and are collected during
weekdays and stored off site outside London. Site
maintainers can individually backup their database and
site content on demand through a backup module we
have created. This could be used to re-establish the
Scratchpad on another server or extract and repurpose
the data.

categories based on taxa, regions, societies, e-Journals/
books, and services. However, many sites have overlapping purposes or change in scope over time, making a
precise site classification difficult. The majority of sites
are taxon focused, serving communities of natural
history researchers specialising in particular taxonomic
groups. Some of these communities are very large.
Nanotax for example http://nannotax.org/ is a welldeveloped site with 132 registered users working on
calcareous nannofossils. Similar examples include sites
on Fungus Gnats http://sciaroidea.info/ and Aroid plants
http://scratchpad.cate-araceae.org/. Modest numbers of
users (10-20) are more typical, such as a site on
freeloader flies http://milichiidae.info/. In other cases a
well-developed site may have a single active registered
user (e.g. http://mosquito-taxonomic-inventory.info/).
Geographically defined Scratchpads includes sites on
the Spermacoce from Australia http://spermacoce.
myspecies.info/ and the Malesian Moss Handbook
http://malesianmosshandbook.myspecies.info/. A
Scratchpad also hosts the Journal of the European
Mosquito Control Association (European Mosquito
Bulletin, see http://e-m-b.org/) and the journal Phasmid
Studies http://phasmid-study-group.org/en/content/
phasmid-studies. Service sites provide facilities and
tools that are not usually taxon-specific but are needed
by natural historians. An example is the World Catalogue
of Common Names http://common-names.myspecies.
info that aims to serve as a repository for common (or
vernacular names) for any species or species group in any
language. While most sites keep the majority of content
public, some like the Howard and Moore Checklist of
the Birds of the World http://birds-howardandmoore.
org/ keep almost all content private. Often there is little
correlation between the size of a site and the quality of
its content. Some sites with the most nodes have only a
handful of registered users, while some high member
sites have relatively little content.

The Scratchpads currently (June 09) support 1,262
registered users who have created 162,753 nodes of
content across 100 different sites. Of these users,
approximately 5% log in every week across one third
of all sites. This rises to 13% of users per month across
50% of sites. A breakdown of statistics on registered
Scratchpad users is available at http://scratchpads.eu/
stats. This list is dynamically updated every day. The
biographic profiles submitted by registered users does
not oblige them to identify their country of origin, but a
crude analysis of domains from registered users’ e-mail
addresses suggests they reside in more than 50 countries
worldwide.

On the Scratchpad homepage we use a basic set of site
statistics to encourage and motivate contribution. Sites
with the greatest number of nodes, users and views are
placed more prominently on the Scratchpad sites list,
encouraging competition between site maintainers that
are keen to promote their work. Within the Scratchpads a
predefined block allow maintainers to place a badge
containing basic usage statistic (users, views and nodes)
on their site. Some site users take a keen interest in their
site usage statistics, to the point of using personal Google
Analytics accounts [51].

Site visitors are recorded on our servers and through a
Google Analytics account [51]. Scratchpad sites http://
scratchpads.eu/siteslist breakdown into five major

Current and future developments
The path to sustaining the Scratchpads lies in distributing the hosting and software development activities

across multiple institutions, and in embedding the
software into the work practices of researchers. Our
future development plans are focused on these goals.
Specifically we are developing partnerships with other
institutions and organisations that have the technical
capacity to host and mirror instances of the Scratchpad
server. We have an agreement with the Encyclopedia of
Life “LifeDesk” project [52], which uses the same
underlying software and approach as the Scratchpads,
in an effort to share development activities. Experimental
Scratchpad servers have been established at New York
Botanic Gardens and Chicago Field Museum. Several
European institutions have expressed an interest in
hosting and developing sites. Our aim is to establish a
foundation of partner institutions and organizations that
will cover the costs of mirroring and hosting Scratchpads
worldwide, and establish a social framework needed to
coordinate and manage the project. These benefits will
be largely invisible to users, except in the context of
providing a more stable and reliable service. To more

directly address user needs we also plan a suite of
functional developments focusing on data capture,
visualization and analytical tools that enable the
Scratchpads to better fit within the work processes of
taxonomists, systematists and the users of these data.
Coupled with these are enhancements to facilitate
greater mobilization of data held within Scratchpad
sites. Space precludes elaboration of these tasks, however
they are broadly outlined in Figure 2.

Discussion
The Scratchpads as they currently stand act like an
archipelago of islands, each representing a natural
history domain that is internally consistent but largely
isolated from the others. Services built into the Scratchpads achieve some limited level of interoperability,
drawing categories of data in from various third parties
and serving data on a handful of common data types.
Scratchpads are also helping to deliver an enhanced level

of social cohesion amongst natural history scientists,
acting as a nexus for communities. But to achieve a
future in which information from different disciplines is
truly interoperable, something more is required.
Natural history scientists might coordinate their efforts
more tightly, perhaps through a top down management
approach. International organisations like GBIF [12],
TDWG [53], and the Consortium for the Barcode of Life
[54] are helping to deliver this. However, in a science
noted for its epistemological diversity, top down efforts
are hard to deliver to hands-on scientists. Technologies
that are tolerant of diverse data models and can
accommodate the ontological richness of natural history
are more likely to succeed. Semantic web activity [55]
offers this prospect, although the low uptake of semantic
software suggests semantic web technologies are too
nascent to deliver on this promise just yet [56].
Arguably in the short term, a third path to a more
effective cyber infrastructure for natural history is more
attainable. Using current technologies to build systems
that encourage the deposition of datasets and facilitate
community annotation and collaboration, we can gain
many of the benefits envisioned for more sophisticated
systems. This approach leverages the human capacity to
make sense of noisy and contradictory natural history
data, while accommodating machine methods like the
automated tagging of content. Tools like the Scratchpads
are not a definitive solution to the problem integrating
natural history data. Rather, as an enabler of digital data
capture and collaborative working, usage of the Scratchpads is a step toward a less fragmented and more
integrated global natural history.

Conclusion
The ordering of data across natural history disciplines is
not simply a question of finding a commonly accepted
database model or standard for representing biodiversity
data. A more generic solution that supports the
ontological richness and diversity of natural history is
required. Scratchpad software is our attempt to meet this
need for communities of natural history scientists where
geographic constraints or limited access to data would
otherwise impede progress. Scratchpads blend social,
technical and policy developments into a common
platform supporting natural history researchers in the
creation and reuse of data. This data publishing framework makes it easy for groups of natural historians to self
assemble around a common interest, and for individuals
to contribute to group effort without formal management. In a biodiverse world we need to be able to

manipulate and annotate ontologically diverse data.
Scratchpads provide a framework to support this data
diversity, and encourage metadata practices that support
global efforts towards a more integrated approach to
natural history.

Authors’ contributions
VSS designs and leads the project, and provides the
biological and sociological insight that defines the
Scratchpad program of work. This includes designing
and testing the Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI)
aspects of component modules and authoring most of
the text and multimedia content on the Scratchpad
project website and within project modules. SDR leads
all aspects of the technical development, writing and
integrating the package of software and providing the
system administration. SDR also manages the additional
technical developers including BS who developed the
initial version of the Scratchpad taxon pages, and KTH
who provides selected testing and user support. DR
provides overall coordination of the Scratchpad activities
within the EDIT program of work and handles project
administration. DR also tests modules and is the
maintainer for a scratchpad on ciliated protozoa http://
ciliateguide.myspecies.info/. VSS wrote the manuscript
with contributions from SDR and DR. Other authors
provided editorial comments and approved the final
draft.
