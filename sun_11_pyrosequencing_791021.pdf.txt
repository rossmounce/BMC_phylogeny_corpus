Abstract
Background: Camptotheca acuminata is a Nyssaceae plant, often called the “happy tree”, which is indigenous in
Southern China. C. acuminata produces the terpenoid indole alkaloid, camptothecin (CPT), which exhibits clinical
effects in various cancer treatments. Despite its importance, little is known about the transcriptome of C. acuminata
and the mechanism of CPT biosynthesis, as only few nucleotide sequences are included in the GenBank database.
Results: From a constructed cDNA library of young C. acuminata leaves, a total of 30,358 unigenes, with an
average length of 403 bp, were obtained after assembly of 74,858 high quality reads using GS De Novo assembler
software. Through functional annotation, a total of 21,213 unigenes were annotated at least once against the NCBI
nucleotide (Nt), non-redundant protein (Nr), Uniprot/SwissProt, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG),
and Arabidopsis thaliana proteome (TAIR) databases. Further analysis identified 521 ESTs representing 20 enzyme
genes that are involved in the backbone of the CPT biosynthetic pathway in the library. Three putative genes in
the upstream pathway, including genes for geraniol-10-hydroxylase (CaPG10H), secologanin synthase (CaPSCS), and
strictosidine synthase (CaPSTR) were cloned and analyzed. The expression level of the three genes was also
detected using qRT-PCR in C. acuminata. With respect to the branch pathway of CPT synthesis, six cytochrome
P450s transcripts were selected as candidate transcripts by detection of transcript expression in different tissues
using qRT-PCR. In addition, one glucosidase gene was identified that might participate in CPT biosynthesis. For CPT
transport, three of 21 transcripts for multidrug resistance protein (MDR) transporters were also screened from the
dataset by their annotation result and gene expression analysis.
Conclusion: This study produced a large amount of transcriptome data from C. acuminata by 454 pyrosequencing.
According to EST annotation, catalytic features prediction, and expression analysis, novel putative transcripts
involved in CPT biosynthesis and transport were discovered in C. acuminata. This study will facilitate further
identification of key enzymes and transporter genes in C. acuminata.

Background
Camptothecin (CPT) was first extracted from the stems
of Camptotheca acuminata in 1966 and subsequently
from Nothapodytes foetida, Ophiorrhiza pumila, and
Ophiorrhiza japonica [1]. CPT exhibits clinical antitumor activity by inhibiting DNA topoisomerase I, an

enzyme involved in DNA recombination, repair, replication, and transcription [2]. CPT also inhibits the retroviruses, such as the human immunodeficiency virus [3].
Despite its significant clinical use, the main source of
CPT is still from its extraction from C. acuminata.
However, the quantity is quite limited and cannot meet
worldwide demand. Studies on the molecular mechanism of CPT biosynthesis have long been hindered by the
lack of transcriptome and genome information for C.
acuminata and other CPT-producing plants. Therefore,
it is necessary to obtain transcriptome data and screen

candidate transcripts involved in CPT biosynthesis to
further understand the CPT biosynthetic pathway.
CPT is synthesized through a modified terpenoid
indole alkaloid (TIA) pathway. The upstream biosynthesis pathways for all the TIA products are similar
among alkaloid-producing plants, and involve a strictosidine backbone (Figure 1A). Over recent decades, several
enzymes in the process of strictosidine biosynthesis in
C. acuminata have been isolated and functionally identified. Among them are tryptophan synthase (TSB) [4]
and tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) [5], which are
involved in the synthesis of the indole precursor tryptamine, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase
(HMGR) [6], 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomeras (DXR) [7], and 10-hydroxy geraniol oxidoreductase (10HGO) [8] are involved in secologanin
synthesis.

G10H and SCS, belonging to the CYP76B6 and
CYP72A1subfamilies of cytochrome P450 family respectively, were identified in monoterpenoid biosynthesis
from Catharanthus roseus [9,10]. The synthesis of strictosidine is finally catalyzed by STR, a committed enzyme
for the CPT backbone biosynthesis, which was isolated
and identified in Rauvolfia serpentine, C. roseus, the
CPT-producing plant O. japonica, and O. pumila, in
previous studies. However, the genes encoding CaG10H,
CaSCS and CaSTR, have not been yet cloned and characterized in C. acuminata.
The steps following strictosidine formation (branch
pathway) are not very clear and only a proposed biosynthetic pathway based on relative compounds extracted
from CPT-producing plants has been reported [11] (Figure 1B). In the proposed pathway, a series of oxidation
and hydroxylation reactions are involved in some steps
of the pathway which are probably catalyzed by

Sun et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:533
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/533

monooxygenases and hydroxylase, belonging to the
superfamily of cytochrome P450s [12,13]. Meanwhile,
the branch pathway of CPT biosynthesis is unique
among TIA pathways because strictosidine is not immediately deglycosylated as in C. roseus [14]. However, it
requires a glucosidase for glycoside hydrolysis, which
likely occurs in one of the last steps of CPT biosynthesis
in C. acuminata and other CPT-producing plants. At
present, the CYP450s and glucosidase involved in CPT
biosynthesis have not been studied in C. acuminata.
Glandular trichomes in leaves are the main site for
CPT accumulation in C. acuminata [15]. However, gene
expression involved in CPT synthesis was not detected
in glandular trichomes but, instead, in epidermal cells
and mesophyll cells in C. acuminata leaves, which
implied the translocation of CPT between organs or
cells [16]. Multidrug resistance protein (MDR) transporters, belonging to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporter family, were reported to be responsible for
uptake or secretion in alkaloid transportation in some
plants [17-19]. Therefore, we hypothesized that MDR
transporters are responsible for CPT transportation
from other cells to glandular trichomes in C. acuminata.
At present, no CPT transport mechanism or related
genes have been investigated in C. acuminata.
Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) analysis has been a
primary tool for the discovery of novel genes, based on
the traditional Sanger sequencing principle, which is
slow and costly for non-model species with little genomic information. The emergence of high throughput
platforms, such as pyrosequencing technology [20],
enables comprehensive study of the transcriptome for
various purposes, such as development study, miRNA
identification, and genetic polymorphisms discovery in
plants and animals [21-23]. The Roche/454 GS FLX
platform, one of the high throughput sequencing platforms, offers the advantages of longer read length and
lower cost which is especially suitable for de novo transcriptome sequencing aimed at gene discovery and analysis in a specific metabolic pathway [24,25]. Previous
studies have indicated that the content of CPT in young
leaves is higher than that in old leaves and root [26,27],
suggesting that young leaf is an important tissue for the
study of CPT biosynthesis and transport. Therefore,
cDNA from C. acuminata young leaves was subjected
to de novo transcriptome sequencing to uncover genes
involved in CPT biosynthesis and transport, using a
Roche/454 GS FLX titanium sequencing platform, a
next-generation sequencing system. Based on the
sequencing and analysis results, three important genes
likely to be involved in the CPT biosynthesis were
cloned and analyzed. From data analysis and expression
analysis, six cytochrome P450s and one glucosidase gene
were found to be candidate genes in the process of CPT

biosynthesis. Meanwhile, three MDR transporter genes
were also found to be candidate genes involved in CPT
transportation.

Results and Discussion
454 sequencing and EST assembly

Through 454 deep pyrosequencing, 74,858 high-quality
(HQ, > 99.5% accuracy on single base reads) reads were
generated and then submitted to the Sequence Read
Archive of NCBI with an accession number SRX033123.
The total length of all the reads is 28,746,026 bp, and
the average size is 384 bp. After sequence assembly,
30,358 unigenes, with an average length of 403 bp, were
generated, including 9,145 contigs and 21,213 singletons.
The average coverage was 3.72-fold. The assembled contigs ranged from 96-3848 bp, with a mean length of 525
bp, including 8,485 contigs which were more than 200
bp (about 92.8%). The singletons ranged from 50 bp to
608 bp, with an average length of 351 bp. The length
distribution of HQ reads (Figure 2A) and assembled
contigs (Figure 2B) are shown for evaluation of the quality of the library. A summary of the sequencing and
assembly results is provided in Table 1.
Annotation and categorization

A total of 21,213 unigenes (69.87%, 21,213/30,358) were
functionally characterized against the NCBI nucleotide
(Nt), non-redundant protein (Nr), Uniprot/SwissProt,
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG),
and Arabidopsis thaliana proteome (TAIR) databases
[28-32]. An overview of the annotation statistics against
public databases (Additional file 1A) and a summary of
the most abundant (Additional file 1B) and longest transcripts of the dataset (Additional file 1C) are listed in
the supporting information.
To functionally categorize the information in this EST
pool, all unigenes were characterized by Gene Ontology
(GO) analysis, provided by the TAIR database. A total
of 18,172 unigenes were classified into three large categories and forty-five subcategories, based on GO classification [33], accounting for approximately 60% of all the
unigenes (Additional file 2).

were discovered. Thirteen of these genes had not been
previously reported, including the important enzymes
geraniol-10-hydroxylase (G10H), secologanin synthase
(SCS), and strictosidine synthase (STR) (Table 2). By
searching the annotation information from the Nr,
Swissprot, and KEGG databases, we found that transcripts of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), 10HGO, and SCS were presented

many ESTs, indicating that they are highly expressed
in the young leaves of C. acuminata. G10H and TDC
were both rare transcripts in the dataset, indicating
that they are rarely expressed and are possibly ratelimiting genes in the tissue. The specific annotation
information of some putative transcripts against the
Nr, Swissprot and KEGG databases is shown in the
supporting information (Additional file 3).

G10H, SCS, and STR are the most important enzymes
in the synthesis of strictosidine in TIA-producing plants,
including C. acuminata. CrG10H, the first CYP450 in
CPT synthesis, is a rate-limiting enzyme in the process
of TIA synthesis in C. roseus. In the 454 dataset, only
one read of G10H was found and it had approximately
60% identical to the G10H gene of C. roseus and Swertia
mussotii. Based on the EST sequence, a putative G10H
gene in C. acuminata (CaPG10H) gene was cloned
(GenBank ID: JF508378) and analyzed. Similarity analysis of the amino acid sequence showed that CaPG10H
shared 56% identity to CrG10H, which implied it may
have catalytic activity in geraniol hydroxylation process
as in C. roseus (Additional file 4). SCS, the second
CYP450, is the last enzyme in the biosynthesis of secologanin. Unigenes, assembled from 165 reads in our
library, were annotated to the CrSCS. One putative SCS
gene in C. acuminata (CaPSCS) was cloned (GenBank
ID: HQ605982), according to a contig that had annotated to the CrSCS gene. The molecular weight of the
predicted protein was approximately 60 kDa. Protein
subcellular localization prediction using the WoLF
PSORT program [34] indicated that the presumed protein was likely targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) membrane. Protein alignment revealed that the

predicted protein shared 68% amino acid identity to that
in C. roseus, which is involved in a similar terpenoid
indole alkaloids biosynthetic pathway (Additional file 5).
From the analysis, we inferred that the CaPSCS gene
may play a role in secologanin biosynthesis in C. acuminata. STR is the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of
strictosidine synthesis. We cloned the ORF of a putative
STR gene (CaPSTR, GenBank ID: JF508375) from C.
acuminata. Phylogenetic analysis showed that STR proteins from reported alkaloid-producing plants were clustered together, which implied that the candidate gene
possibly plays a role in CPT biosynthesis (Figure 3A).
Expression analysis of transcripts for proteins involved in
strictosidine synthesis

Methyl jasmonate (MeJA)-induced accumulation of secondary metabolites and related gene expression has
been reported in medicinal plants such as Panax ginseng
and C. roseus [35-37]. A previous report determined
that the CPT content responded to MeJA and jasmonic
acid, and that the response curve for jasmonic acid
treatment was a waveform, with two time-specific CPT
accumulation peaks in C. acuminata suspension cells
[38]. However, there are few reports of the effect of
MeJA treatment on the expression of genes of CPT biosynthesis in C. acuminata. In response to MeJA

(A) Protein sequences for 22 STRs were aligned using the ClustalW module and phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA 4.0. (B) Relative
expression of three genes after induction by MeJA. Expression levels in young leaves without treatment served as controls (M0). M1, M3, M6,
M12 and M24 indicate that the treatment times of 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h, respectively. (C) The quantification of three genes involved in

treatment, transcripts of G10H, SCS and STR were regulated in a waveform manner, including two expression
peaks during 24 hours of induction (Figure 3B). The
trend of the curve was consistent with the result of a
previous report for genes in anthocyanin biosynthesis
[39]. In this study, all the detected genes responded to
MeJA immediately, with a common peak within one
hour of induction, and then decreased rapidly to even
lower levels than the control. The expression levels
increased again to the second peak, whose timing was
gene-specific. Therefore, we speculate that transcripts of
CaG10H, CaSCS, and CaSTR were most likely to be
involved in CPT biosynthesis. It has been reported that
TDC genes, which are responsible for the production of
tryptamine for auxin and CPTs, do not respond to
MeJA [40]. The expression of HMGR genes is even
inhibited by MeJA in C. acuminata [41]. This is likely
to be because the substrates of TDCs and HMGRs link
primary and secondary metabolism, and their expression
profiles are complicated.
Previous reports had shown that young and actively
growing tissues, showed the highest level of CPT [26].
In this study, the mRNA levels of CaG10H, CaSCS and
CaSTR were detected using real-time PCR. The results
demonstrated that the expression levels of the three
genes were all higher in young leaves and petioles than
in old leaves (Figure 3C). Therefore, young leaves and
young petioles are the possible sites of active CPT
synthesis, as well as sites of accumulation, in C.

acuminata compared with the mature tissues. This difference served as a standard for real-time PCR detection
for downstream candidate gene selection [42]. Meanwhile, the expression levels of these genes were also
relatively lower in the root and root bark which implied
that root may not be a main synthetic tissue. This was
consistent with the expression pattern of the TDC1 and
10HGO genes reported in a previous study [16].
Transcripts for proteins likely to be involved in the
branch pathway of CPT synthesis

Strictosidine rapidly forms the intermediate product
strictosamide in C. acuminata. The steps after strictosamide synthesis remain somewhat unclear. Based on the
proposed branch steps, an intermediate step between
strictosamide and 3(S)-pumiloside in the CPT biosynthetic pathway was presumed to be catalyzed by a cytochrome P450, with another P450 possibly in the last
steps of CPT biosynthesis (Figure 1B). Cytochrome
P450s, are a large and complex superfamily, which play
important roles through catalysis of oxidation and
hydroxylation reactions. In C. acuminata, no cytochrome P450 involved in the downstream CPT biosynthetic pathway had been cloned and identified. After
EST annotation against the Swissprot database, 99 putative cytochrome P450 transcripts were identified in the
454 ESTs pool (Additional file 6), belonging to 28 cytochrome P450 subfamilies, according to the standard
CYP family categories (Additional file 7). According to

Sun et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:533
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/533

clan classification, transcripts of CYP71 clan and CYP72
subfamilies are likely to be involved in secondary metabolism [43]. A total of 27 cytochrome P450 transcripts
belonging to these two subfamilies were discovered as
candidate genes for further screening. Glucosidases,
which is a superfamily involved in various biological
process including cell wall assembly, polysaccharides,
plant defense and secondary metabolism, catalyze the
action of deglycosylation [44]. It had been reported that
b-D-glucosidase plays a role in glycoside hydrolysis in
TIA biosynthesis in plants such as C. roseus [11], Psychotria ipecacuanha [45] and R. serpentine [46,47]. In
the 454 dataset, one transcript (contig 00133) annotated
as strictosidine b-D-glucosidase in C. roseus (CrSGD)
was identified with a predicted homologous peptide of
178 amino acids. The peptide was found to share 70%
similarity to amino acids 47-224 of CrSGD and 62%
similarity to amino acids 18-195 of the b-D-glucosidase
IpeGlu1 of Psychotria ipecacuanha (PiIpeGlu1), which is
involved in ipecac alkaloid synthesis. When compared
with raucaffricine-O-beta-D-glucosidase (RsRD) and
SGD (RsSGD) of another TIA-producing plant, R. serpentine, these proteins showed 69% and 74.8% (Additional file 8) similarity, respectively. CrSGD, RsRD,
RsSGD and IpeGlu1 all belong to the glycosyl hydrolase
(GH) family, which catalyzes the deglycosylation reaction in the TIA pathway, and their substrates are strictosidine, raucaffricine and N-deacetyli(so)pecoside,
respectively. The predicted glucosidase peptide demonstrated high amino acid similarity with the glucosidases
identified above as being involved in the alkaloid biosynthetic pathway. Therefore, CaPGD is likely to be a key
enzyme in CPT synthesis through removal of a glucose

moiety. Analysis of the amino acids of the predicted
peptide demonstrated that three key amino acids 161His, 207-Glu and 210-Thr, which were key amino acids
for catalytic activity [47], are found in the corresponding
residues of the predicted peptide of the PGD transcript
in C. acuminata. The 388-Trp was not included in the
peptide.
After initial screening, relative expression analysis in
young/old leaves of the 27 cytochrome P450s and the
CaPGD was performed for C. acuminata. Consequently,
six cytochrome P450 transcripts and one CaPGD transcript that were shown to be expressed three-fold higher
than the control were identified as candidate genes for
participating in the branch pathway of CPT biosynthesis
(Figure 4).
Transcripts for proteins likely to participate in CPT
transport

MDR is a subfamily of the ABC transporter family that
has been reported to be related to the transport of
alkaloids metabolites [18]. From the annotated databases, 21 MDR transporters were found in the 132
ABC transporter transcripts in the library. Some of the
transcripts were possibly responsible for CPT transport
from synthesis site to the glandular trichomes in leaves
through the plasma membrane [48]. Previous studies
showed that the CPT content was four to five-fold
higher in young C. acuminata leaves compared with
mature leaves [49]. It is possible that CPT transporters
were more abundant in the young leaves than in
mature ones [50]. Subsequently, the 21 annotated
MDR transporter transcripts were subjected to expression analysis in young leaves and old leaves of C.

leaves was set to be the control. O: old leaves; Y: young leaves. 1-27 represent 27 cytochrome P450 transcripts in this dataset.

acuminata by real-time PCR. The results showed that
the expression level of three transcripts (FXAT9O006HB5TT, FXAT9O006HKTK5, and contig05927) among the annotated MDR transporters
were three-fold higher in young leaves than in the
mature leaves. Thus, they represent candidate genes
for CPT transportation in leaves (Figure 5).
Probable site of CPT biosynthesis

Young leaves are the main site for CPT accumulation;
therefore, this tissue was used to identify new genes in
CPT biosynthetic pathway by high throughput sequencing. After assembly and annotation, 20 enzyme genes
that act before the step of strictosidine synthesis were
found in the dataset, including the key genes encoding
G10H, SCS and STR. This result indicated that many
putative genes in CPT synthesis are expressed in young
leaves, which demonstrates that young leaves are likely
to be active tissues for CPT biosynthesis as well as accumulation. Expression profile analysis indicated that the
biosynthesis of strictosidine may be more active in
young leaves and petioles than in mature leaves and
roots. This result indicates that CPT is likely to be
synthesized in young leaves, which is consistent with a
recent study [16]. Young leaves and petioles are likely to
be the main sites for CPT biosynthesis. The lower
expression in roots implies that roots may not be a
main tissue for CPT biosynthesis; however, CPT does
accumulate in roots. Therefore, our results support the
hypothesis that in C. acuminata, the main CPT synthesis site is the young leaf.

Page 8 of 11

The subcellular site for CPT synthesis in C. acuminata, has not been reported previously. In this study, we
predicted that the CaSCS gene was localized in the ER.
The results indicated that secologanin in C. acuminata
is possibly biosynthesized in the ER, which was consistent with the studies of CPT location in hairy roots of
O. pumila [48]. Therefore, we hypothesize that in C.
acuminata CPT is likely to be biosynthesized in the ER
and then transported to a vacuole [15] or excreted outside the cytoplasmic membrane, as reported in O.
pumila [51].

Conclusion
In this study, a high quality cDNA library was established
to mine effective transcriptome information in CPT biosynthesis and transport in C. acuminata. A method was
adopted for gene discovery using a combination of
sequence annotation, chemical catalytic features prediction and transcripts expression profiling for deep mining
of target genes of the CPT metabolism pathway. Consequently, a number of putative transcripts, including
genes encoding G10H, SCS, STR, cytochrome P450s, glucosidase, and MDR transporter genes, were identified as
possibly being involved in CPT biosynthesis and transport. Meanwhile, three important genes encoding proteins involved in CPT backbone biosynthesis were cloned
and analyzed. The transcriptome data represents a valuable genetic resource for further identification of genes
involved in CPT biosynthesis and transport. This dataset
could be beneficial for further research of the CPT metabolism pathway and molecular genetic breeding.

Methods
Materials preparation and treatment

Young leaves (the first leaf from the apex of side
branches, including the apex) for library construction
and gene cloning [52] were collected from a C. acuminata tree with a diameter of 14 cm cultivated in the
greenhouse of the IMPLAD (Institute of Medicinal Plant
Development), Beijing, China. Root, root bark, stem,
petiole (the petiole of the first young leaf), young leaves
(the first leaf from the apex of the side branches) and
old leaves (the fifth leaf from the apex of the side
branches) were prepared from the same tree for expression analysis as described previously [52]. The second
young leaves from the apex of each branch (about 4 cm
long) were cut off for treatment. For the MeJA induction experiment, young leaves were soaked in 100 μM
MeJA, with unsoaked leaves serving as a control. The
experimental materials were then immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C for further processing. All the real-time experiments were repeated three
times.
RNA preparation

Total RNA was isolated using the Universal Plant RNA
Isolation Mini Kit (BioTeke, Beijing, China), according
to the manufacturer’s recommendation. Total RNA
quantity and quality were determined with a GeneQuant100 spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare, UK) and
1% agarose gels.
cDNA library construction

Total RNA was extracted from young leaves of C. acuminata. RNA samples were digested with RNase-free
DNase I (TURBO DNase; Ambion, TX, USA) immediately after RNA extraction. The digested RNA was converted to cDNA using a SMART cDNA synthesis kit
(Clontech, CA, USA) and then amplified by applying the
Advantage II polymerase (Clontech, USA) to increase
the total quantity of the sample for sequencing. Purification of the amplified products was carried out with the
PureLink™ PCR purification kit (Invitrogen, USA).
Sequences shorter than 300 bp were removed, and
approximately 5 μg purified cDNA was sent for a 1/8
run using the 454 GS FLX platform shotgun sequencing
(454 Life Sciences, Roche).
EST assembly

GS FLX De Novo Assembly Software v2.0.01 (454 Life
Sciences, Roche) was used for EST processing and
assembly. ESTs with weak signals and low quality were
filtered through the software analysis (using default
parameters). Sequencing adaptors were trimmed using
the software, and then high-quality (> 99.5% accuracy
on single base reads) reads were generated (using default

Page 9 of 11

parameters). The SMART PCR primers (Clontech) were
then screened, and HQ reads that were shorter than 50
bp were removed for data cleaning of the cDNA library.
The remaining HQ ESTs were used for de novo assembly using the GS FLX De Novo Assembly Software
v2.0.01 (using default parameters), with a quality score
threshold set at 40. After assembly, all the sequences,
including contigs (obtained from one cluster) and singletons (appeared only once), were named as “unigenes”
for subsequent annotation.
Functional annotation and classification

Similarity searches were carried out against a series of
nucleotide and protein databases, such as the Nt, Nr,
SwissProt, Kegg, and TAIR databases [28-32], with a
common significance threshold cutoff of E-value ≤ 1e-5.
For the database annotation, the top five results based
on BLAST scores were retained for transcriptome analysis. Gene Ontology classification of TAIR was used to
assign the functional roles of C. acuminata through
similarity searches. All unigenes were classified into
forty-five subcategories belonging to three major categories: cellular component, molecular function and biological process.
In this study, the transcripts were identified and
screened by searching the annotation for scores over
100 and were checked manually.
ORF cloning of putative genes encoding proteins from
the backbone of CPT biosynthesis

RNA samples of young leaves for gene cloning were
converted to first-strand cDNA of the 5’ and 3’ ends
according to the SMART™ RACE cDNA Amplification
Kit User Manual (Clontech, USA). RACE PCR Primers
for G10H and STR cloning were designed based on the
sequence of FXAT9O006GXSI6 and contig03632
respectively in the dataset (Table S1). Primers for G10H
and STR genes cloning were designed according to the
entire assembled sequence of RACE PCR. Gene cloning
of SCS was performed using the annotated unigene contig00661 in the cDNA library, which had integrated
ORF sequences. Primers for SCS cloning were designed
from the 3’ end and 5’ untranslated region of contig
00661, which contained an entire ORF. Advantage 2
Polymerase Mix (Clontech, USA) was used for PCR
amplification of 3’ ends, 5’ ends and ORFs of the three
genes. All three genes were amplified at 95°C for 3 min;
followed by 25 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 57°C for 30 sec
and 72°C for 1 min 30 sec; and a final step at 72°C for
10 min. The recycled products were integrated into a
pMD® 18-T vector (Takara, Dalian, China) and transferred into E. coli DH5a competent cells (Transgene,
Beijing, China). The isolated clones were sequenced on
a 3730XL (ABI, USA). Sequence alignment with

CrG10H and CrSCS in C. roseus was carried out using
the DNAMAN software (Lynnon Biosoft, USA). A phylogenetic tree of CaPSTR was constructed according to
the amino acid sequences of selected plants. The evolutionary analysis was generated using the software of
MEGA 4.0.
Expression analysis

To determine the expression profile of the transcripts
involved in CPT biosynthesis, mRNA levels of the transcripts at different tissues and under different treatments
were analyzed using Quantitative Real-time PCR. The
PrimeScript™ 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (TaKaRa,
Dalian, China) was used for single-strand cDNA synthesis using 1 μg RNase-free DNase I-treated (TaKaRa,
Dalian, China) total RNA. Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR)
was carried out at least three times each with SYBR ®
Premix Ex TaqTM (Perfect Real Time) (TaKaRa, Dalian,
China) on an IQ5 Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection
System (Bio-Rad, USA). Each qRT-PCR system contained 10 μL 2 × SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™, 0.2 μM forward and reverse primers and 1 μL cDNA template.
The PCR amplification program was as follows: 50°C for
2 min; 95°C for 30 sec; 40 cycles of 95°C for 3 sec and
62°C for 40 sec; followed by a melting-curve program of
55°C to 85°C, with a 5-sec hold at each temperature.
The gene expression patterns of all genes were normalized to an internal reference (18S rRNA) [53]. The relative gene expression analysis was performed using BIORAD IQ™5 optical system software version 2.0 with the
2 -ΔΔCt method. All the real-time PCR primers were
designed using OMIGA software (Accelrys, USA) with
suitable parameters (length: 100-300 bp; Tm: approximately 62°C). The sequences of all primers are listed in
the supporting information (Additional file 9).
