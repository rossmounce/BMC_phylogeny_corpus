Abstract
Background: The Brazilian population is mainly descendant from European colonizers, Africans and Native
Americans. Some Afro-descendants lived in small isolated communities since the slavery period. The
epidemiological status of HBV infection in Quilombos communities from northeast of Brazil remains unknown. The
aim of this study was to characterize the HBV genotypes circulating inside a Quilombo isolated community from
Maranhão State, Brazil.
Methods: Seventy-two samples from Frechal Quilombo community at Maranhão were collected. All serum samples
were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).
HBsAg positive samples were submitted to DNA extraction and a fragment of 1306 bp partially comprising HBsAg
and polymerase coding regions (S/POL) was amplified by nested PCR and its nucleotide sequence was determined.
Viral isolates were genotyped by phylogenetic analysis using reference sequences from each genotype obtained
from GenBank (n = 320). Sequences were aligned using Muscle software and edited in the SE-AL software.
Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were conducted using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to obtain the
MCC tree using BEAST v.1.5.3.
Results: Of the 72 individuals, 9 (12.5%) were HBsAg-positive and 4 of them were successfully sequenced for the
1306 bp fragment. All these samples were genotype A1 and grouped together with other sequences reported
from Brazil.
Conclusions: The present study represents the first report on the HBV genotypes characterization of this
community in the Maranhão state in Brazil where a high HBsAg frequency was found. In this study, we reported a
high frequency of HBV infection and the exclusive presence of subgenotype A1 in an Afro-descendent community
in the Maranhão State, Brazil.

Introduction
It is estimated that two billion people have been infected
with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and that more than 350
million are chronic carriers of this virus [1]. HBV strains
have distinct geographical distribution and are classified
into nine genotypes, A to I, on basis of genome diversity
[2]. Genotype A is found mainly in North America and
Africa and has been found in six genetically distinct

subgenotypes (A1 to A6) [3]. Genotypes B and C are
prevalent in Southeast Asia and the Far East. Genotype
D has a worldwide distribution and is found predominantly in the Mediterranean region and Central Asia.
Genotypes E and F are prevalent in West Africa and in
the Native American population, respectively [4]. In
addition, genotype G has been reported in the USA,
France [5], Colombia [6] and Brasil [7] and genotype H
has been found in North and Central America [8].
Recently, by using phylogenetic analyses, a new genotype was characterized in Vietnam and Laos and designated as genotype I [2,9,10].

In Brazil, a wide variation of HBV infection prevalence
was reported, particularly dependent upon the geographical region of this country [11]. Genotype A is the
most prevalent and genotypes B, C, D and F are also circulating in the population [12-15]. The presence of
these genotypes reflects the mixture of cultures in the
Brazil: Native American, European and African ancestral
roots, showing this country as an important model for
studies of population genetics [16].
During the slavery period in Brazil (from XVI to XIX
centuries), some African people managed to escape to
refuge areas, living with others in well hidden places in
the woods. These places were known as Quilombos and
they were regions of large concentration of runawayslaves, far from urban centers and located in areas with
difficult access. Their inhabitants generally stayed in culturally isolated communities without significant additional admixture since their establishment. Quilombos
were located in different Brazilian states around the
country: Pará (PA), Maranhão (MA), Alagoas (AL), Pernambuco (PE), Bahia (BA), Goiás (GO), Mato Grosso do
Sul (MS), Minas Gerais (MG), Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and
São Paulo (SP) [17].
The quilombo Frechal is located in the municipality of
Mirinzal, at the region of lower western Maranhão
State, Brazil (Figure 1). The Frechal community was
founded in the late XVIII century and was devoted to
sugar production till the XIX century. The Frechal community is one of the oldest and most important Quilombos located in Maranhão State (http://www.cpisp.org.br/
comunidades/html/brasil/ma/ma_comunidades_frechal.
html, accessed at 11/01/2011).
The aim of this study was to analyze the presence of
current HBV infection by HBsAg and HBV DNA detection in the current inhabitants of Frechal community
and to determine which HBV genotypes are found
among these cases.

using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method [18]. To avoid false-positive results, strict
procedures for nucleic acid amplification diagnostic
techniques were followed [19].
HBV PCR Amplification

Samples were first amplified with the primers described
by Sitnik et al. [13] in order to obtain a 416 base pairs
(bp) fragment partially covering the HBsAg coding
region (S) to confirm the presence of HBV-DNA in the
sample.
To characterize HBV genotypes, a fragment of 1306
bp partially comprising HBsAg and the polymerase coding regions (S/POL) of HBV genome was amplified by
nested PCR using the primers PS3132F (3132 nt - 3151
nt)/2920R (1417 nt - 1398 nt) and PS3201F (3201 nt 3221 nt)/P1285R (1285 nt - 1266 nt) [6].
HBV Nucleotide Sequencing

Amplified DNA was purified using ChargeSwitch® PCR
Clean-Up Kit (Invitrogen, São Paulo, Brazil). Sequencing
was performed in an ABI Prism ® 377 Automatic
Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA),
based on the protocol described by Sanger et al. [20],

Materials and methods
Study Population

Seventy-two samples from inhabitants from Frechal,
Maranhão were collected from 2000 to 2001 (Figure 1).
Ethical Committee of the University of Sao Paulo, Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil, approved this protocol. All
patients have signed an informed consent form before
the samples were collected for research. The samples
were screened for HBsAg using commercially available
kits (DiaSorin Ltda, Saluggia, Italy). HBsAg positive samples were submitted to PCR amplification to detect HBV
DNA.
HBV DNA extraction

Viral nucleic acids (HBV DNA and HDV RNA) extraction was carried out from 100 μl of sera for each sample

using dideoxy nucleotide triphosphates (ddNTPs) containing fluorescent markers (Big Dye® Terminator v3.1
Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit - Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The quality of each electropherogram was evaluated using the Phred-Phrap
software [21] and consensus sequences were obtained by
using an alignment constructed with CAP3 software
available at the web page Electropherogram quality analysis (http://asparagin.cenargen.embrapa.br/phph/).
HBV Genotyping Analysis

Sequences were assigned to HBV genotypes after phylogenetic analysis using reference sequences from each
HBV genotype obtained from the GenBank (n = 320).
These sequences comprised partial HBsAg and polymerase coding regions (S/POL). They were aligned using
Muscle Software [22] and edited with the SE-AL software (available at http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/seal/).
To perform the phylogenetic analysis, the missing
nucleotides were coded as “missing characters” in nexus
block. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were done applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation using
BEAST v.1.5.3 [23], and 10 million generations were sufficient to obtain the convergence of parameters. The
relaxed uncorrelated log normal was the best molecular
clock for the dataset. The maximum clade credibility
(MCC) tree was obtained from summarizing the 10,000
substitution trees and then it was removed 10% of burnin using Tree Annotator v.1.5.3 [23].

Results
Of the 72 samples, 9 (12.5%) were HBsAg-positive. Since
we did not have epidemiological data about this population, it was not possible to compare HBsAg results with
other demographic information. Of these nine samples,
six were positive by nested PCR for the S fragment (416
bp) and among them, 4 also amplified the S/POL region
(1306 bp).
To perform the phylogenetic analysis, the longest fragment available from each sample was sequenced and
classified as subgenotype A1 (subtype adw2). Although
the four samples from Frechal were grouped in the
same cluster in the tree, it cannot be assumed that there
was a founder effect in this community because this
group is supported only with a low posterior probability
(0.10) (Figure 2). Sequences were deposited in GenBank
at accession numbers: HM772994 - HM772997.
Discussion
This is the first study that characterized HBV genotypes
present in an isolated community from Maranhão state,
Brazil. Since the genotype A1 has been reported as a
common genotype in African and Brazilian populations
[12,13,24-28], the four samples were compared with

Page 3 of 6

others previously reported sequences from Quilombos
in Brazil [28] and Venezuela [29] and with sequences
from Rio de Janeiro, as in this place there was a constant slave traffic from Africa that was most intense
between 1795 to 1811 [30]. The subgenotype A1
sequences from Quilombos and Rio de Janeiro did not
assemble in a single group in the tree. These results
suggest the presence of the different A1 strains within
the Quilombos populations. These variants may have
come from Africa before these groups were created and
actually the HBV/A1 strains continued to evolve in the
Afro-descendent population after they came to Brazil.
A lot of Afro-descendants live in Bahia in Northeast
Brazil. The geographic distributions of HBV genotypes
have showed that genotype A (subtype adw2) is the
most frequent in according to the ethnic background of
the population [31]. It was reported a high prevalence of
genotype A in Bahia but short-length sequences available prevented performing phylogenetic analysis
together with the other ones analyzed in this study.
Moreover, it is possible that different A1 variants have
different African origin, as during the slave trade time,
slaves from different countries from Africa were mixed
on the boats and then were sold and distributed in different Brazilian regions [32].
We found that the three sequences from Afro-Venezuelan population [29] were classified as subgenotype
A2 (Figure 3), which suggest different origin of HBV
strains circulating in this population compared with
African descendants in Brazil. Moreover, a specific
polymorphism was found in HBV S region that distinguish subgenotypes A1 and A2 and it was agreed with
HBV genotype A classification previously reported
[33]. The synonymous substitutions at nucleotides in
the third-positions: 201 nt (TCC ® TCA) Serine [S];
222 nt (CCC ® CCA) Proline [P]; 324 nt (TCA ®
TCG) Serine [S]; 327 nt (TCT ® TCC) Serine [S] and
462 nt (TAC ® TAT) Tryptofan [W] were identified
and they confirm the results of subgenotype classification (Figure 3).
Finally, we found a high frequency of HBsAg in the
Frechal population (12.5%). Kalunga population, the largest Afro-Brazilian isolated community located in Goiás
state, showed lower frequency for HBsAg (1.8% - 16/
878). HBV subgenotype (A1) was also found in all the
positive samples from Goiás [34].
Another study, with 1058 individuals living in12 different isolated Afro-descendant communities, was carried
out in Mato Grosso do Sul state and showed that
among 1058 individuals, 23 (2.2%) of them were HBsAg
positive. The highest prevalence was detected in Furnas
dos Dionisios community (42.4% to anti-HBc and 7.4%
to HBsAg) and the overall prevalence for HBV infection
was 19.8% [35]. Subgenotype A1 was the most frequent

Figure 2 The maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was estimated by Bayesian analysis of 320 S/POL sequences with 1306 bp of
Hepatitis B virus strains. The posterior probabilities of the key nodes (internal nodes) are depicted above the respective nodes. Samples HBV/A1
obtained from Frechal (n = 4, red taxa) were analyzed together with other worldwide strains by Maximum Likelihood (ML) method (n = 134). The
clusters containing the strains of others Afro-Brazilian communities previously reported are highlighted (Blue taxes). Genotype B (n = 19), genotype
C (n = 20), genotype D (n = 24), genotype E (n = 7), genotype F (n = 25), genotype G (n = 4), genotype H (n = 6) and genotype I (n = 9)
branches were collapsed. Also, the subgenotypes A2 (n = 52), A3, A4, and A5 (n = 10), A6 (n = 3) and A7 (n = 7) branches were collapsed.

Figure 3 Multiple alignment of partial HBV/S gene (184 to 468 nt) comprising HBV/A1 sequences from Brazil, which are compared
with other sequences of subgenotypes HBV/A2 to HBV/A6 previously reported. The five specific substitutions for subgenotype A1 are
shown in the figure (blue squares)

in this state, followed by subgenotype A2 and genotype
D [28].
HBsAg frequency in Afro-Venezuelan communities
(3.6%) and in rural populations from Venezuela were
higher than those found in Brazilian studies involving
Quilombo inhabitants (2.2%) [29,35].
In Frechal, seventy-two samples were collected and this
sample size probably did not represent the population
but our data suggest a high frequency of HBV in this
community. However, further studies are needed to better evaluate the epidemiology of hepatitis B in this region.
In this study, we reported a high frequency of HBV
infection and the exclusive presence of subgenotype A1
in an Afro-descendent community in the Maranhão
State, Brazil. In conclusion, HBV subgenotype A1 was
found in all African descendant population from South

America studied so far except in Venezuela, where subgenotype A2 was found. Also, this study shows the need to
report more HBV sequences from Afro-descendant communities to complement the actual data and the establishment of an accurate substitution rate for this virus to
understand the evolutionary origins. The study of HBV
sequences from other Afro-descendant communities
from American countries, as well as from other different
African countries, will allow a better understanding on
HBV spreading between these two continents.
