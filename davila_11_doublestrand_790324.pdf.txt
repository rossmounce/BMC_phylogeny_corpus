Abstract
Background: The mitochondrial genome of higher plants is unusually dynamic, with recombination and
nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) activities producing variability in size and organization. Plant mitochondrial
DNA also generally displays much lower nucleotide substitution rates than mammalian or yeast systems.
Arabidopsis displays these features and expedites characterization of the mitochondrial recombination surveillance
gene MSH1 (MutS 1 homolog), lending itself to detailed study of de novo mitochondrial genome activity. In the
present study, we investigated the underlying basis for unusual plant features as they contribute to rapid
mitochondrial genome evolution.
Results: We obtained evidence of double-strand break (DSB) repair, including NHEJ, sequence deletions and
mitochondrial asymmetric recombination activity in Arabidopsis wild-type and msh1 mutants on the basis of data
generated by Illumina deep sequencing and confirmed by DNA gel blot analysis. On a larger scale, with
mitochondrial comparisons across 72 Arabidopsis ecotypes, similar evidence of DSB repair activity differentiated
ecotypes. Forty-seven repeat pairs were active in DNA exchange in the msh1 mutant. Recombination sites showed
asymmetrical DNA exchange within lengths of 50- to 556-bp sharing sequence identity as low as 85%. De novo
asymmetrical recombination involved heteroduplex formation, gene conversion and mismatch repair activities.
Substoichiometric shifting by asymmetrical exchange created the appearance of rapid sequence gain and loss in
association with particular repeat classes.
Conclusions: Extensive mitochondrial genomic variation within a single plant species derives largely from DSB
activity and its repair. Observed gene conversion and mismatch repair activity contribute to the low nucleotide
substitution rates seen in these genomes. On a phenotypic level, these patterns of rearrangement likely contribute
to the reproductive versatility of higher plants.

Background
While producing a circular genetic map, plant mitochondrial chromosomes comprise a heterogeneous population
of highly branched, circularly permuted linear molecules
[1,2]. In plants, large-sized mitochondrial repeats (more
than 1,000 bp) conduct high-frequency reciprocal recombination to subdivide the genome [3]. Given the linear
structure of the genome, this recombination activity is

suspected to participate in recombination-mediated replication initiation [4,5].
Mitochondrial genome plasticity is evident in extensive
DNA polymorphism among closely related lines of a given
plant species [6], rapid accumulation of polymorphisms
within a line under cell culture conditions [7-9] and novel
insertions, deletions and sequence chimeras [6]. These
types of genomic alterations are causative in cytoplasmic
male sterility (CMS) in a wide range of plant species [10],
implying an adaptive rationale for the genomic phenomena [11]. Still, questions remain about the processes
underlying mitochondrial genome variation, since most
previous studies have addressed existing variations without

the benefit of de novo events. Mitochondrial DNA replication in plants is not well-detailed, but both rolling circle
and recombination-mediated replication have been suggested [4,12,13]. Likewise, the DNA repair mechanisms
accounting for unusually low nucleotide substitution rates
in plants are not known [14,15].
Sufficient mitochondrial DNA has been extracted from
plant tissues to suggest the presence of multiple copies of
the genome per cell, but available data suggest that the
genome is organized into a heterogeneous population of
DNA molecules maintained at vastly different relative
copy numbers. Some substoichiometric DNA configurations are stably maintained in the genome and transmitted
to progeny at levels approximating 1 copy per 200 cells
[16]. The term “substoichiometric shifting” (SSS) refers to
the reversible interconversion of these low-level forms to
high copy numbers, influencing gene expression in the
process [17,18]. This intragenomic copy number shifting is
rapid, likely occurs during plant reproduction [19] and
involves differential recombination at intermediate-sized
repeats within the genome [20,21].
Asymmetrical recombination is characterized by the
accumulation of only one of the two predicted DNA
exchange products. Intermediate repeats support asymmetrical recombination in the plant mitochondrial genome at extremely low levels. This recombination activity
accounts for faint “ghost” band polymorphisms commonly reported in DNA gel blot hybridization experiments involving long film exposure times [20].
Disruption of the Arabidopsis nuclear gene MSH1 (MutS
1 homolog), a component of mitochondrial recombination surveillance [20,22], allows increased recombination
activity at these repeats. Recent studies of mitochondrial
genomic changes in the Arabidopsis msh1 mutant, performed using PCR and DNA gel blot analysis, permitted
functional identification of 33 intermediate repeat pairs
108 to 556 bp in size [21], implying a potential for massive rearrangement of the mitochondrial genome by this
type of recombination activity. In “first-generation” msh1
mutants created by pollination of a wild-type line with
mutant msh1 pollen and selection of the F2 msh1/msh1
segregant, low-level recombination activity is initiated at
each repeat. By the “advanced generation,” derived by
recurrent self-pollination of the msh1 mutant, recombination is extensive and recombinants are present at high
copy numbers [21].
Most previously acquired information about plant mitochondrial genome variation has relied on studies of CMS
mutants and DNA polymorphism in natural populations.
Discovery of msh1 permits direct investigation of mitochondrial de novo recombination and its relationship to
high levels of structural variation and unusually low
nucleotide substitution rates unique to plants. In our present study, next-generation sequencing provided sufficient

sensitivity for detailed investigation of the asymmetrical
strand invasion and gene conversion process as well as
sufficient throughputfor cataloging genomic alterations
associated with rapid, intraspecific mitochondrial genome
evolution.

Results
Next-generation sequence analysis reveals additional
intermediate repeats not previously detected

Mitochondrial asymmetric DNA exchange in the msh1
mutant involves 47 repeat pairs ranging from 50 to 556 bp
in size (Figure 1A). This was deduced by identification of
paired adjacent sequences that were known to map distal
to one another. Such paired-end sequences were clustered
in msh1 first- and advanced-generation mutants in a manner distinct from the wild type (Additional file 1, Figure
S1). All identified clusters could be explained by recombination events involving intermediate repeats. While confirming previously identified repeats [21], deep sequencing
revealed 14 new repeat pairs ranging from 50 to 250 bp in
size, with sequence homology within each pair ranging
from 85% to 98% and the smallest repeats displaying the
highest identity (Figure 1B). All recombination detected at
intermediate repeats showed asymmetrical exchange
activity.
Intermediate repeats reveal essential features of the
mitochondrial DNA exchange process

The size range of active repeats reflects the length of
homology required to permit DNA exchange. While
repeated sequences smaller than 50 bp were detected in
the genome, they showed no evidence of recombination
activity, suggesting that 50 bp approximates a lower size
limit for msh1-associated DNA exchange. Recombination patterns at intermediate repeats imply a process of
break-induced replication on the basis of the uniformly
asymmetrical nature of DNA exchange [23,24]. Each
repeat showed a conserved polarity for strand invasion,
which was suggested by the accumulation of only one of
the recombinant products and, in some cases, concomitant loss of one of the parental forms [21]. The observed
polarity was confirmed by comparing high-throughput
sequence frequencies at sites flanking repeats in firstand advanced-generation msh1 mutants with the wild
type (Figure 2A; Additional file 2, Figure S2; and Additional file 3, Table S1). Analysis of clustered intermediate repeats allowed us to compare relative strand
invasion polarities and showed both opposite and samestrand polarities at neighboring repeats, with no obvious
association with local direction of transcription (Figure
2B). It is possible that these sites of active, bidirectional
strand invasion might represent replication origins (for
example, at sites between repeats E-2 and O-2 and
between repeats L-1 and G-2).

that are active in the msh1 mutant. Newly identified repeats are shown in blue. (B) Size (y-axis) and percentage homology (color) distribution of
newly identified repeats.

Sequence analysis of the recombination product for
nonidentical repeats, composing about 50% of all active
intermediate repeats, provided evidence of heteroduplex
formation followed by mismatch repair (Figures 3A and
3B). According to our data, nucleotide mismatches are
repaired using the donor strand as a template. In Figure
3A, the nucleotide insertions in the donor strand are
cleaved, giving the appearance of partial gene conversion. However, a more extensive survey of repeats
showed no clear pattern of donor or recipient strand
cleavage for correction of nucleotide insertions. These
results reveal the presence of a mitochondrial mismatch
repair mechanism in plants that is independent of
MSH1.
To assess the influence of msh1 recombination on
mitochondrial genome copy number, we compared relative copy number at 11 sites within the mitochondrial
genome of the wild type (Col-0) and the msh1 mutant
(Figure 4). In each case, copy number was higher in the
mutant, implying that overall mitochondrial DNA copy
number increases with enhanced recombination. One
possible explanation for this observation might be
enhanced break-induced replication of the genome in the
absence of MSH1

Mitochondrial recombination in the msh1 mutant
produces two patterns of genomic rearrangement

We compared the read frequency for parental forms in
different generations of the msh1 mutant against wild
type. This allowed us to trace the fate of parental products over time in the msh1 mutant. Most repeats
appeared to fall into one of two general categories
(Figure 5). Class I repeats lost one parental form as they
acquired the recombinant, resulting in the appearance
of both deletion and gain of genomic forms. Class II
repeats retained the parental forms as they acquired the
recombinant, resulting in the appearance of a novel
genomic form. The parental form that was reduced was
consistently that which donates the invading strand.
This “gain” and “loss” of genetic environments is the
consequence of SSS, and PCR-based analysis has revealed
that these genomic environments change in relative copy
number merely as a consequence of recombination
[20,21]. From a genomic perspective, sequences residing in
proximity to these intermediate repeats have the greatest
likelihood of undergoing SSS, although we have identified
sequences some distance from an identifiable repeat that
also undergo SSS. We observed several essential genes
residing in proximity to class II repeats (Table 1), but

Figure 2 Asymmetrical strand invasion polarity at intermediate mitochondrial repeats. (A) Relative changes from wild type in deep
sequence coverage across each environment for repeat CC in msh1 first-generation (left) and advanced-generation (right) mutants were used to
define strand invasion polarity. Polarity shown in the lower panel is based on depletion of region 1 relative to region 2 compared to wild type
and on an increase in region 3 relative to region 4 compared to wild type. To quantify read depth of flanking regions, we considered all read
pairs for which one end mapped to the repeat and the other mapped to the region flanking the repeat. Thus, the length of the flanking
sequence is approximately 220 bp. (B) Graphical representation of strand invasion polarities across clusters of repeats in the Arabidopsis Col-0
mitochondrial genome. Polarities were defined by deep sequence analysis using the procedure shown in (A) and confirmed by DNA gel blot
analysis. Polarity of strand invasion was established on the basis of which repeat-flanking region displayed an increase in sequence depth and, in
the case of class I repeats, a concomitant decrease in sequence depth across the other repeat-flanking region.

none residing adjacent to class I repeats (with the exception of Atp9, which encompasses a class I repeat). Presumably, the relative proximity of a repeat to essential genetic
information could impose selection for the parental form,
the class II pattern.
In msh1 advanced- versus first-generation mutants, we
investigated the reversibility of recombination activity
upon replacement of the MSH1allele. While first-generation msh1 rearrangements appeared to be fully reversible by crossing the msh1 line with the wild type and
deriving an F2 progeny, advanced-generation rearrangements were not reversible, based on analysis of 10 individual F 2 plants from both crosses and assaying three
repeats (L, D and F) for recombinant configurations
(data not shown). We attribute these results to cytoplasmic sorting of the least prevalent forms once MSH1 is
reintroduced. Thus, in the first generation, where the
quantity of recombinant molecule is low relative to nonrecombinant, recombinant forms are diluted and nonrecombinant forms predominate. In advanced generations,
where recombinant forms have accumulated to higher
levels, their loss by sorting is precluded.

The Arabidopsis mitochondrial genome undergoes rapid
and extensive rearrangement

In our investigation of the influence of double-strand
break (DSB)-mediated changes on genomic variation, we
sequenced and assembled the mitochondrial genomes of
ecotypes Col-0 and Landsberg erecta (Ler) and compared these with the publicly available C24 sequence
(confirmed by resequencing). Among the three ecotypes,
we found virtually identical genomic coding capacity
within genomes that had undergone extensive rearrangements. The majority of the structural polymorphisms
found can be attributed to DSB repair activity by either
nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) or intermediatesized repeat-mediated recombination (Figures 6A and
6B).
Stoichiometric variation among ecotypes includes a
repeat-containing interval of 1.7 kb, originally reported
by Forner et al. [25], that is present in Col-0 but substoichiometric in C24 and Ler [21]. The corresponding
“junction” configuration that lacks this 1.7-kb insertion
is present in C24 and Ler, but is substoichiometric in
Col-0. Likewise, an unrelated interval of 1.2 kb present
in C24 and Ler was found to be substoichiometric in
Col-0. The corresponding “junction” lacking this 1.2-kb
interval is present in Col-0 but substoichiometric in C24
and Ler (data not shown).
While cross-ecotype genomic comparisons gave evidence of ecotype-specific divergence by insertion and
deletion of distinct genetic information, this variation
was largely accounted for by asymmetrical recombination-mediated SSS. Researchers in earlier cross-genotype
studies in maize and sugar beet, involving multiple lines,
reported similar mitochondrial variation [6,26]. While
the researchers in neither of the earlier studies investigated substoichiometric forms in the genome, we suggest that some of the reported insertions and deletions
distinguishing the closely related genotypes in those species likely derive from SSS activity.
The extensive mitochondrial DNA polymorphism
among lines within a species was not surprising, given
what has been reported in other plant studies [27].
What was significant in our investigation was the discovery that nearly all of the variation observed could be
accounted for by DSB repair activity or nucleotide substitutions. This observation prompted us to investigate
the extent to which DSB repair processes have participated in plant mitochondrial genome evolution.
DSB repair occurs widely in Arabidopsis mitochondrial
genomes

To assess the role of DSB repair in mitochondrial genome evolution, we assembled and compared mitochondrial sequences from 72 different Arabidopsis ecotypes.

We collaborated with the Arabidopsis 1001 Genomes
project (http://www.1001genomes.org/) to obtain mitochondrial sequences for subsequent identification of
polymorphisms. The mitochondrial genome sequences
were scanned for SNPs to assess phylogenetic relationships among the ecotypes. Cross-ecotype SNP comparisons suggested that the 72 ecotypes comprised six
phylogenetic groups (Figure 7). The derived groupings
appeared to correspond generally with the geographic
origin of each line, and the variation measured is likely
to reflect divergence over a span of 120,000 years [28].
This observation would be consistent with the observed
sequence divergence across ecotypes, which was
approximately one-twentieth that of Arabidopsis lyrata,
with an estimated divergence time of four to five million
years.
Mitochondrial structural polymorphisms revealed
extensive genomic variation distinguishing each line. The
majority of structural changes represented nonhomologous, recombination or small deletion activity (Figure 8).
The small deletions were a small proportion (about 20%)
of the total structural polymorphisms detected. Crossecotype cataloging of observed structural variation
revealed remarkable correspondence with the six SNPbased phylogenetic groups (Figure 8). These observations
would be expected if DSB repair served as a prominent
contributor to the rapid evolution rate of plant mitochondrial genomes.

Discussion
While we have not yet identified the genomic features that
condition asymmetrical recombination in the Arabidopsis
mitochondrial genome, we have shown in the present
study that the process comprises the primary pattern of
DNA exchange at intermediate-sized repeat sequences in
the absence of MSH1. It is possible that the observed
asymmetrical exchange might be a consequence of differential maintenance of recombination products rather than
the consequence of dominant strand invasion polarity.
While it has been suggested that analysis of low-frequency
recombination events can sometimes be confused with
PCR-generated artefacts [29], our analysis of de novo

recombination in msh1 confirms prolific DNA exchange
activity. Data from our studies suggest that strand invasion
occurs throughout the genome, a likely consequence of
random DSBs, but is prevented by MSH1 from producing
successful DNA exchange in stretches of sequence homology under about 556 bp. In the absence of MSH1, strand
invasion proceeds at smaller lengths of homology to a
lower limit of approximately 50 bp.
In the wild-type line, mitochondrial DNA exchange at
intermediate repeats does occur, but at very low levels,
presumably because it is prevented by MSH1 surveillance.
This infrequent recombination is detected as faint ghost
bands by DNA gel blot analysis [20,21]. MSH1 encodes a
carboxy-terminal GIY-YIG endonuclease domain,
although direct participation in double-strand cleavage to
abort DNA exchange has not yet been formally tested.
MSH1 presumably permits repair of a DSB at stretches of
homology greater than 550 bp following heteroduplex formation, assuming a break-induced replication model (see
Additional file 4, Figure S3).
In the msh1 mutant, heteroduplex formation occurs
within the intermediate repeat stretches of homology. The
observation of heteroduplex-mediated mismatch repair in
this study provides important evidence relevant to the low
mitochondrial nucleotide substitution rates reported in
plants [14]. Our study also shows that this mismatch
repair activity is independent of MSH1. Interestingly,
nucleotide divergence within intermediate repeat intervals,
estimated across 72 Arabidopsis ecotypes at 5.5 per 10,000
bp, approximates the average for the genome as a whole,
which is 5 per 10,000 bp. However, in regions of the genome where high-frequency reciprocal DNA exchange
occurs, within large (more than 1,000 bp) repeats, levels of
polymorphism were 66 times lower, averaging 7.5 per
Mbp for the 6.5-kb repeat across 72 ecotypes. These
observations imply that the low-frequency exchanges
observed at intermediate repeats in the wild-type line may
be sufficient to confer the low nucleotide substitution rate
observed generally in the Arabidopsis mitochondrial genome. In animal lineages, nucleotide substitution rates in
the mitochondrial genome are much higher, with the
notable exception of corals and their relatives [30]. Intriguingly, the corals appear to be the only known animal lineage encoding a mitochondrial Msh1, with similarities in
structure to MSH1 in plants [31].
Analysis of mitochondrial genomic rearrangements differentiating the Col-0, Ler and C24 ecotypes revealed
three primary classes of genomic changes as recombination, NHEJ and deletion, all of which may represent consequences of DSB repair (Figure 9). An important aspect of
NHEJ may be the formation of sequence chimeras, some
of which encode transcriptionally active open reading
frames that could condition phenotypic variations, such as
CMS. Proximity of a CMS sequence chimera to a class I

repeat can allow changes in copy number of the region by
recombination at the repeat. CMS induction was shown to
occur by MSH1 suppression in various plant species [32].
The resulting mitochondrial DNA rearrangements are
presumed to result in copy number amplification of a
novel, preexistent, CMS-inducing genomic environment.
SSS-associated copy number reduction of male sterility
sequences has been associated with spontaneous reversion to fertility in common bean, Brassica, and maize Stype cytoplasm [18,33-35]. Whether the frequency of
reversion responds to altered MSH1 expression in the
plant, and whether MSH1 expression is influenced by
environmental cues such as unsuccessful pollination, is
an intriguing possibility. MSH1 transcription is environmentally responsive [36], but it is not clear whether carbon flux acts as a signal. An isolated male-sterile plant,
following a period of unsuccessful pollination, might
affect carbon signaling to suppress MSH1, amplifying
mitochondrial recombination for SSS and reversion to
fertility. Such a process, if it occurred late in the flowering cycle, would ensure a successful seed set.

Conclusions
In our present study, we conducted a detailed analysis of
de novo recombination and genome rearrangement processes that characterize plant mitochondrial genomes. The
rapid rate of plant mitochondrial intraspecific structural
variation and low nucleotide substitution rates can both
be accounted for by unusual DSB repair within the genome. These observations consequently implicate DSB
repair processes as a driver in the evolutionary divergence
of plant and animal mitochondria. The dynamic nature of
plant mitochondrial genomes, and their ability to retain
genetic variation substoichiometrically, presumably
enhance environmental responsiveness and increase reproductive versatility.
Methods
DNA gel blot and PCR assays

Total genomic DNA was extracted from above-ground
tissues according to previously published procedures
[37]. Mitochondrial DNA preparation, DNA gel blot
analysis and hybridizations were performed as described

NHEJ REC DEL

Figure 8 Mitochondrial genome structural changes coincide with SNP-based phylogeny. Structural changes arising by nonhomologous
end-joining (NHEJ), deletions caused by recombination at repeats (REC) and small deletions, perhaps arising by replication slippage (DEL), were
categorized according to ecotypes, allowing assessment of the relationship of SNP-based phylogeny to changes arising by genomic
rearrangement. Putative sites in the tree where some of the changes may have occurred are indicated. The tree shown is unrooted.

previously [38]. The primers used to PCR-amplify
probes are listed in Additional file 5, Table S2.
Quantitative polymerase chain reaction

Genomic DNA (100 ng) was used for quantitative PCR
with the SYBR GreenER qPCR SuperMix for iCycler kit
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Quantitative PCR data
were collected and analyzed using iCycler iQ version 3.1
software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).
Three biological replicates were used for each experiment,
each sample was run in triplicate and the results were
averaged. Nuclear single-copy loci (AtMSH1 and AtACTIN2) served as nuclear DNA content controls. The primers used for real-time analysis are presented in
Additional file 5, Table S2.
Sequencing and read mapping

Illumina Solexa Sequencing Technology (Illumina, Inc,
San Diego, CA, USA) paired-end reads of Col-0 were

assembled using the comparative assembler AMOScmp
version 2.08 software program (with default parameters)
[39] with the C24 mitochondrial genomic sequence as a
baseline to obtain 57 contigs with an N50 of 25 kb and
coverage of 230×. In a similar manner, C24 was resequenced and 54 contigs obtained, with an N50 of 30 kb
and coverage of 371×. Single and paired-end reads for
Ler were mapped against the reference genome of C24
using Velvet version 1.1 software (with default parameters) [40] and SHOREmap version 0.5 software (with
default parameters) [41] to obtain 19× coverage, and consensus sequences and deleted regions were identified
using custom-made Perl scripts. The contigs for these
three ecotypes were assembled into circular scaffolds
based on DNA gel blot analysis and PCR assays. Graphical genome maps were generated using OGDraw software [42]. The annotated genome sequences for ecotypes
C24, Ler and Col-0 are available from GenBank [GenBank:JF729200, GenBank:JF729201, GenBank:JF729202],

Figure 9 Modeling alternative double-strand break repair outcomes. Sequence analysis suggests three means of double-strand break (DSB)
repair, resulting in evidence of nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), reciprocal recombination at large repeats and asymmetrical recombination
at intermediate repeats (IRs). Asymmetrical recombination activity at IRs residing on molecules containing gene chimeras can result in
substoichiometric shifting (SSS) for relative copy number suppression or amplification of the genomic environment surrounding the chimera.

and intermediate repeats are annotated. Generated raw
sequence data are available from the sequence read
archive [GenBank:SRA039856].
The Illumina Genome Analyzer (Illumina, Inc) was
used with paired-end reads of 36 bp, a mean library
length of 220 and a standard deviation of about 20. This
length spanned approximately half of the repeats in the
mitochondrial genome. Coverage for first-generation
msh1 was about 600×{and for advanced-generation msh1
it was about 200×. Reads of the Illumina Solexa Sequencing Technology paired-end sequencing for first- and
advanced-generation msh1 (Col-0) mutants were mapped
to the mitochondrial genome of Col-0 using Velvet software [40] and SHOREmap software [41], and recombination points were identified with a customized script
designed to cluster paired-end reads whose ends map to

regions separated by more than 1,000 bp. Clusters with
more than 10 reads in both the first- and advanced-generation msh1 lines were selected, and putative repeats
were identified by BLAST analysis [43] of the selected
region against the mitochondrial map. Coverage analysis
of the regions around the intermediate repeats was done
using custom-made scripts. On the basis of observed
behavior in both the first- and advanced-generation msh1
lines and DNA gel blot data, we determined the putative
direction of strand invasion around the repeats. For
nucleotide sequence analysis of the intermediate repeats
in the msh1 mutants, we used a custom-made script to
derive the consensus sequence.
Illumina Solexa Sequencing Technology paired-end
sequence data for 80 ecotypes was produced by the Weigel
laboratory at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental

Biology (http://www.1001genomes.org/). Aligned sequence
data against the C24 mitochondrial genome with SHOREmap version 0.5 software [41] allowed us to select of 72
ecotypes with more than 15× coverage. SNPs against C24
were calculated using custom-made scripts for regions
with more than 5× coverage and nucleotide occurrence in
more than 80% of the reads mapped. For phylogenetic
analysis, a concatenated set of 1,059 SNPs distributed
across the genome in both protein-coding regions and
intergenic regions was considered for each ecotype. Poorly
aligned regions and regions with gaps in most ecotypes
were excluded from the analysis, and a total of 676 nucleotides were used for each ecoytpe. A maximum likelihood
model was preferred over a parsimony approach, considering its statistical consistency. Using PhyML version 3.0
software [44], we constructed the tree with an HKY85 substitution model and a g distribution with four different
categories, and one hundred bootstrap replicates were performed. The resulting trees are unrooted. Graphical phylogenetic trees were generated by using TreeDyn software
[45]. Geographical maps were generated by using a custom-made script and Google Static Maps API version 2
(http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/staticmaps/). Deletions were identified by analyzing the coverage data, and recombination polymorphisms were
identified by grouping paired-end reads whose ends map
to regions separated by more than 1,000 bp with a custom-made script. Data for the 80 ecotypes are available at
“1001 Genomes: A Catalog of Arabidopsis thaliana
Genetic Variation: MPICao2010: 80 Arabidopsis thaliana
accessions” (http://www.1001genomes.org/projects/MPICao2010/index.html) [46].

Additional material
Additional file 1: Figure S1. Clusters of recombinant paired ends in
wild-type and msh1 first- and advanced-generation mutants reveal
recombination differences. x- and y- axes represent the coordinates of
the first part and second part, respectively, of the paired-end read. The
radius of the circle represents the number of reads that cluster around
such coordinates. The graphs correspond to wild-type (a), msh1 firstgeneration (b) and msh1 advanced-generation lines (c). Small-radius
circles in the wild-type lines were taken as background and subtracted
from the graphs of the mutants. Increased levels of recombination are
observed across generations of the mutant. The red circle represents a
structural feature present in wild types and mutants at the same level
used as controls.
Additional file 2: Figure S2. Fate of genomic environments around
repeats in msh1 mutants across generations. y-axis represents the
percentage changes in coverage across each copy of the repeat with
respect to wild type. The pink and red squares represent the
recombinant forms gained in msh1 first- and advanced-generation lines.
The turquoise and blue triangles represent the parental forms lost in
msh1 first and advanced generations. These were calculated as the
difference in coverage of right versus left flanking regions of each repeat
relative to wild type. A gradient, as well as a correspondence, between
gain of recombinant and loss of parental forms is observed across
generations.

strand invasion polarity for intermediate repeats in the msh1
mutant. Coverage data are shown for first- and advanced-generation
mutants. The data show changes in coverage with respect to Col-0 for
regions flanking each repeat, along with deduced order of strand
invasion (strand polarity). Confirmation by gel blot analysis is indicated
for several sites.
Additional file 4: Figure S3. Potential outcomes of double-strand
break repair during break-induced replication. With the occurrence
of a double-strand break (DSB) during replication, 5’ to 3’ strand
recession occurs, followed by strand invasion to a homologous duplex
for reestablishment of the replication fork. (1) Occurrences of the DSBs at
a unique region. (2) When the DSB occurs at a repeated region, two
outcomes are possible: (a) strand invasion at homologous repeats or (b)
strand invasion across different copies of the repeat to produce a new
genomic environment as the recombinant MSH1 prevents DNA
exchange beyond the region of sequence homology within the repeated
sequence.
