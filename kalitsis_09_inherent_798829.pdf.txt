Abstract
Background: Many mammalian genes are arranged in a bidirectional manner, sharing a common
promoter and regulatory elements. This is especially true for promoters containing a CpG island,
usually unmethylated and associated with an 'open' or accessible chromatin structure. In evolutionary
terms, a primary function of genomic methylation is postulated to entail protection of the host
genome from the disruption associated with activity of parasitic or transposable elements. These are
usually epigenetically silenced following insertion into mammalian genomes, becoming sequence
degenerate over time. Despite this, it is clear that many transposable element-derived DNAs have
evaded host-mediated epigenetic silencing to remain expressed (domesticated) in mammalian
genomes, several of which have demonstrated essential roles during mammalian development.
Results: The current study provides evidence that many CpG island-associated promoters
associated with single genes exhibit inherent bidirectionality, facilitating "hijack" by transposable
elements to create novel antisense 'head-to-head' bidirectional gene pairs in the genome that
facilitates escape from host-mediated epigenetic silencing. This is often associated with an increase
in CpG island length and transcriptional activity in the antisense direction. From a list of over 60
predicted protein-coding genes derived from transposable elements in the human genome and 40
in the mouse, we have found that a significant proportion are orientated in a bidirectional manner
with CpG associated regulatory regions.
Conclusion: These data strongly suggest that the selective force that shields endogenous CpGcontaining promoter from epigenetic silencing can extend to exogenous foreign DNA elements
inserted in close proximity in the antisense orientation, with resulting transcription and
maintenance of sequence integrity of such elements in the host genome. Over time, this may result
in "domestication" of such elements to provide novel cellular and developmental functions.

Background
The emergence of novel gene functions is an essential
driving force behind the evolution of species. Many

molecular mechanisms have been described that contribute to this process including gene duplication, exon shuffling, retroposition, transposable element insertion,

lateral (horizontal) gene transfer, and gene fusion/fission
events [1].
One of these mechanisms, transposable or mobile elements, are segments of DNA encoding genes that assist in
DNA excision, replication and integration of the elements
into new regions of the genome. Until recently transposable elements (TEs) have been considered parasitic or selfish DNAs that contribute little to the host organism [2,3].
These elements generally exist as neutrally evolving inactive DNA remnants that are epigenetically silenced by the
host genome to prevent transcription and subsequent
transposition [4,5]. Such elements are therefore subject to
little selective pressure and subsequently acquire sequence
variation (mutations) over time. However, it has recently
been shown that some TEs escape host cell silencing to
become 'domesticated' by host genomes resulting in the
formation of novel genes [6-8]. Such domesticated elements are involved in many cellular and developmental
functions including placental development, viral resistance, chromatin structure, DNA recombination and
repair, gene regulation, apoptosis and brain development
[8]. Given these facts, it appears that a complex evolutionary interplay exists between genomic silencing of transposon elements to prevent their proliferation, and co-option
of transposon-encoded proteins to provide novel cellular
functions in higher eukaryotic genomes.
In an attempt to understand and identify the molecular
mechanism/s of domestication we have examined the
number of such genes in the human and mouse genomes
and analysed the features of their genomic insertions sites.
We classified each according to gene/promoter structure,
degree of conservation, expression profile, and transposable element type.
Whereas previous studies have suggested that the majority
of transposable element domestication arises via a gene
fusion event or genomic insertion in close proximity to a

cryptic promoter [1,8,9], our analysis has revealed that
only a small proportion of co-opted TE-derived genes
arise from such events. Rather, we have identified a significant number of domesticated TEs that share a promoter
with a neighbouring gene in a head-to-head, or bidirectional arrangement. We have further examined the role of
CpG rich 'inherently bidirectional' promoters in the insertion of foreign elements in recently evolved genes and
experimental systems.

Results
Domestication of protein-coding transposable elements in
mammalian genomes
Recent studies have surveyed eukaryotic genomes for the
presence of TEs that have been co-opted by their host
genome [7-10]. In the human genome it has been estimated that approximately 0.1% of all protein-coding
genes contain (at least) part of a TE, however little data are
available related to the potential mechanisms leading to
TE co-option [9]. We have utilised updated genome annotation and genome-wide expression data to expand this
analysis to further examine the co-option status of
inserted transposable elements by mammalian genomes
(Tables 1 and 2 and Additional file 1 and 2). Since a high
proportion of protein-coding genes in both humans and
mouse contain small insertions from common TEs such as
Alu and B1 type elements, we limited our survey to genes
with protein coding regions of at least 30% sequence
length homology to a known TE (see Materials Methods).

Using these selection criteria, we identified a total of 63
transcribed protein-coding genes within the human
genome derived from previously characterised TEs. These
can be grouped into three main classes: DNA transposons,
retrotransposons and endogenous retroviruses. The most
abundant group are DNA transposons (n = 42) followed
by retrotransposons (n = 19) and endogenous retroviruses
(n = 2) (Table 1 and Additional file 1). Of note, all of these
elements contain intact open reading frames and evidence

of transcriptional activity, suggesting production of functional proteins. (Additional files 1 and 2). Fewer TEderived genes were identified in the mouse genome (45
compared with 63). However, a similar distribution of TE
classes was observed for mouse with 23 DNA transposons,
18 retrotransposons and 4 endogenous retroviruses.
A link between TE domestication and bidirectional
promoters?
TE insertion into downstream regions (exons or introns)
of annotated genes to create a chimeric gene has previously been reported (Figure 1 and Additional file 1 and 2)
[9,11]. Of the 63 potential domesticated TE genes we have
identified in the human genome, only 10 (15.9%) are
likely to have arisen in this manner. Thus, 84% of the
domesticated genes show an alternative mechanism of
insertion. Further analysis of the genomic landscape associated with this subclass revealed a disproportionate
number that appear to share a common promoter
arranged in an antisense orientation (ie. bidirectional
pair).

To test the frequency of this arrangement we compared
the incidence of TE-associated bidirectionality with the
human genome average of bidirectional gene pairs. Exact
estimates of the number of bidirectional genes in the
human and mouse genomes vary, between 9.8% (4,226
of 42,887 transcription units; [12]) and 11% of human
genes (2,700 of 24,000 genes; [13]), and 8.9% of mouse
transcriptional units (3,276 of 36,606) exist as part of a
bidirectional pair, with transcription start sites less than 1
kb apart [12,13]. Using similar criteria we observed that
23 of the 63 (36.5%) co-opted TE genes exist as part of a
bidirectional pair in humans which is significantly greater
than the genome average of such an arrangement; Ï2 =
39.3, p < 0.0001 (Table 1 and Additional file 1). The
mouse genome also contains a significantly higher proportion of co-opted genes in bidirectional pairs (12 of 45,
26.7%) when compared with the genome average (Ï2 =

17.5, p < 0.0001) (Table 2 and Additional file 2). In order
to test whether the 30% TE similarity cut off used in our
analysis preferentially identified genes with a reduced
cDNA length relative to the genomic average, we calculated the mean cDNA length of bidirectional gene pairs
relative to the genome-wide average. No significant difference between the two data sets was observed with a
genome-wide mean cDNA length of 2465 bp (2130 bp
median) [13] and a mean cDNA length of bidirectional
pairs of 2352 bp (2086 bp median).
Between 77% [13] and 94% [12] of bidirectional promoters in the human genome contain a classical CpG island,
defined as a stretch of DNA over 200 bp, with a G + C content of over 50%, and an observed/expected ratio of CG
dinucleotides of over 0.6 [14]. This appears to be a specific
feature of mammalian genomes [15]. The corresponding
proportion for unidirectional promoters in the human
genome is between 38% [13] and 60% [12] depending on
whether annotated genes or transcriptional units are used
as a reference. CpG island length of bidirectional promoters appears significantly longer than unidirectional promoters [12]. However CpG island size is not strictly a
determinant of bidirectionality status [16]. In human and
mouse genomes we found that all cases of bidirectional
promoters associated with a domesticated TE contain a
CpG island that shows some overlap of the first exons of
both the host and domesticated TE genes (Table 1 and 2,
and Additional files 1 and 2).
Inherent bidirectionality and open chromatin of CpG
islands - a chink in the defensive armour
Most CpG islands within the human genome exist in an
unmethylated state and are associated with constitutively
active genes [17,18]. Such a state is invariably associated
with an open chromatin structure that is anticipated to
render the underlying DNA accessible to chromatin-associated proteins involved in the transcriptional regulation.
We postulated that the majority of promoters containing

CpG islands within mammalian genomes show inherent
bidirectional capacity which, coupled with their open
chromatin state, renders them ideal target sites for the
integration and subsequent transcription of TEs arranged
in an antisense direction to the endogenous partner gene.
We anticipated that the constitutive transcriptional state
of the promoter region of the founding member of the
pair has the additional effect of protecting the incoming
parasitic DNA element from the endogenous gene silencing machinery that would normally render such insertions inactive and prevent their expression following
integration.
To test whether CpG islands associated with unidirectional transcription units have inherent properties permissive for bidirectional transcription, we investigated the
nature of trapped loci that have been characterised as part
of the International Gene Trap Consortium (IGTC) in
mouse embryonic stem cell lines [19]. We screened the
database for the presence of anti-sense transcripts which
overlapped or were upstream of exon 1 of an annotated
gene. These were aligned for position and direction within
the mouse genome. We selected anti-sense gene-trap tags
according to the following selection criteria; overlapping
with exon 1 or the predicted promoter, and within 2 kb
upstream of the annotated transcription start site or CpG
island. Sequence tags located downstream of the annotated transcription start sites and known bidirectional
genes were excluded from analysis.

domestication
Molecular models for transposable element co-option and
Molecular models for transposable element cooption and domestication. (A) Transposable elements
often insert into intergenic or intronic regions but are generally transcriptionally silenced through epigenetic modification. Over time mutations accumulate due to a lack of
selective pressure to maintain sequences intact. If the TE
contains sequences that drive transcription it may remain
active if insertion takes place in a genomic location that
favours expression over TE repression and silencing. (B) TE
may insert into a region of the genome with inherent transcriptional activity or in close proximity to a cryptic CpG
rich promoter (green box) that may result in TE avoiding epigenetic silencing to remain active. (C) Less frequently, TEs
may insert downstream of the transcription start site of a
host gene (i) either into an intron, or (ii) exon (iii) with the
potential to create novel chimeric genes and/or proteins. (D)
Insertion of a TE upstream of a host gene in an antisense

TE may insert further away from host promoter but will
form a novel gene with a new upstream exon and an intervening intron that is spliced during mRNA formation.

From a total of 7592 Ensembl genes trapped by the IGTC
as of 8-May-2006 we identified 11 (0.145%) annotated
genes or transcriptional units (TUs) associated with antisense trap-tags (Table 3 and Additional file 3). Of these,
seven contain more than one tag in the anti-sense direction, and two loci are tagged with more than one type of
gene-trap vector. Similar to the bi-directionally co-opted
human and mouse TEs, all of the genes associated with
anti-sense trap tags have an associated CpG island. Further evidence in support of antibiotic resistance gene cassette rescue by anti-sense transcription is the splicing of
the resulting anti-sense transcript tags or rare ESTs, as
observed for the Daxx, Kif2a and Uba52 genes. Cap analysis gene expression (CAGE) tags indicative of potential
anti-sense transcription start sites [20] were also found at
most sites of bidirectional gene-trap insertions (Table 3).
Further data supporting an inherent bidirectionality of
'unidirectional' gene promoters in the human genome has
also been described [13]. Of 56 random nonbidirectional
promoters assayed for transcriptional activity in vitro, 52%
were active in both directions. In contrast, 90% of 258
assayed bidirectional promoters were active in both directions. Data from this study also suggests that bidirectional
promoters share a common DNA region necessary for

inseparable functional units [13].
In combination, these data demonstrate the inherent
capacity for bidirectional transcription of CpG islandassociated promoters in mammals, adding support to our
hypothesis that such sites are suitable for the opportunistic insertion and expression of foreign TE transcriptional
units into mammalian genomes.
TIGD1, a recently domesticated DNA-based transposable
element
TIGD1 is an example of a recent co-opted transposable
element present in human and chimp genomes as part of
a bidirectional gene pair. DNA sequence analysis reveals
that TIGD1 retains the conserved catalytic DDE/D core
but lacks one of the terminal inverted repeats necessary for
transposition (data not shown) [21]. To further delineate
the extent of conservation and estimate the time of acquisition of this element in evolution, we searched available
genomic sequence datasets or performed PCR analysis on
the intergenic junction region between the TIGD1 and
EIF4E2 genes in a panel of primate and other mammalian
genomic DNAs. TIGD1 was detected in all primate species
including human, Pan troglodytes (chimp), Pan paniscus
(bonobo chimp), Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus (orangutan), Macaca mulata (rhesus monkey), Macaca nemestrina
(pigtailed macaque), Saguinus labiatus (tamarin), Ateles
geoffroyi (spider monkey), Otolemur garnetti (small-eared
galago) and Lemur catta (ring-tailed lemur) (Figure 2 and
Additional file 4). However, TIGD1 is absent in other
mammalian groups examined including the tree shrew,
Tupaia belangeri (Scandentia) and the little brown bat,
Myotis lucifugus (Chiroptera), the next closet representative orders to primates. Therefore TIGD1 domestication
occurred concurrently with the divergence of the primate
lineage between 67 to 98 million years ago [22].

Murine bidirectional endogenous retroviruses
The Friend virus susceptibility gene (Fv1) confers resistance against the murine leukaemia virus in mice [23,24].
This endogenous retrovirus appears to have been a recent
co-option event, since it is not present in the rat genome.
It shares homology with the gag domain of other endogenous mammalian retroviruses, especially the mouse
MuERV-L (Figure 3). Fv1 exists in a bidirectional pairing
with the D4Wsu114e gene (transcription start sites <250
bp apart). Although endogenous retroviruses are generally
flanked by 5' and 3' LTR sequences (5'LTR sequence conferring promoter activity), no such promoter LTR elements appear to have contributed to the insertion and
retention of this endogenous retroviral element.

Another mouse-specific endogenous retrovirus of
unknown function that has recently been co-opted is the
4632419I22Rik gene. This exists as part of a bidirectional
pair with Brip1, (transcription start sites 170 bp apart).
PCR amplification of a panel of rodent species revealed
the presence of this gene in all Mus species including; M.
musculus, M. musculus castaneus, M. spretus, M. famulus, M.
caroli, M. pahari, and M. saxicola (Figure 4 and Additional
file 5). These results suggest that 4632419I22Rik appeared
with the Mus lineage, after the divergence of the Rattus
sensu lato and Praomyini (containing Mastomys) clades
[25]. Similar to the Fv1 insertion, 4632419I22Rik does not
include a 5'LTR sequence (Figure 3).
Retroposed genes
Retroposed genes usually arise from the reverse transcription of a host cell RNA with subsequent integration of the
intronless cDNA into the host genome at a new location,
usually in the absence of any upstream regulatory elements. This process is thought to be mediated by the by
the reverse transcriptase enzyme of the L1 family of retrotransposons [1]. To investigate the degree to which transcribed retroposed genes are inserted and maintained

through inherent bidirectional activity of CpG island promoters, we examined the genomic location of the top 20
transcribed retroposed genes in the human genome [26]
(Additional file 6). Of these, six (30%) were found to be
bidirectional (transcription start site within 1 kb of an
annotated gene) and associated with a CpG island. When
we extended our analysis to include the top 50 transcribed
retrogenes, no additional instances of bidirectionality
were observed suggesting a possible link between bidirectionality and transcriptional activity.
Genomic environment - pre and post insertion
To examine the genomic landscape before and after gene
insertion we chose a group of recently domesticated genes
that exist as part of novel bidirectional pairings with a
common CpG island promoter. This list comprised two
primate-specific genes (TIGD1 and PGBD4) and two
mouse-specific genes (Fv1 and 4632419I22Rik). Each
ancestral gene promoter was anticipated to be unidirectional. However, two of the four genes display some

degree of bidirectional activity as evidenced by CAGE
and/or EST tags in species lacking the TE insertion element
(Table 4 and Figure 5). TE insertion and maintenance of
coding capacity appears to be associated with an increase
in CpG island length for the TIGD1-EIF4E2,
4632419I22Rik-Brip1 and Fv1-D4Wsu114e promoter
regions, whereas the CpG island associated with PGBD42900064A13Rik/C15ORF24 remained unchanged following TE insertion (Table 4). Increasing size is associated
with an increase in the number of CpG dinucleotides in
the region closest to the newly co-opted gene. Interestingly, this is also associated with an increase in the ratio of
antisense: sense (co-opted: host) CAGE tags associated
with each CpG island region post TE insertion, suggesting
an increasing capacity for antisense transcription or
increasing transcript stability following TE insertion
(Table 4 and Figure 5).
Co-expression of human TE-bidirectional gene pairs
To examine whether the human TE-derived bidirectional
gene pairs exhibit coordinate expression we performed a
correlation analysis using publicly available GNF Gene
Expression Atlas 2 data on 79 human tissues [27]. A Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated for nine gene
pairs where both were included on the array and at least
one of which exhibited detectable expression levels following array analysis (Additional file 7). Of the pairs
examined 56% (5/9) showed a correlation coefficient of

Discussion
Most of the DNA that makes up complex genomes is parasitic in nature, derived from transposable elements
acquired throughout evolution. Generally, these elements
exist as neutrally evolving inactive DNA remnants (or fossils) silenced by the host genome over time. Relatively little attention has been paid to a minority of conserved TEs
that retain protein coding capacity, and are expressed with
varying degrees of cell-type specificities. Many of these are
conserved across phylogeny, suggesting a degree of selective pressure over time that may be indicative of functional importance [21,28].

greater than 0.7 with 33% (3/9) showing a correlation
value of over 0.8. This supports previous data showing
bidirectional gene pairs are more likely to be co-expressed
when compared with random gene pairs [13].

The process of "domestication" of such transposable element-encoded proteins is just beginning to be appreciated
and begins with a co-option (integration and expression)
of a TE into the host genome. Numerous examples of such
elements contributing to the acquisition of specific novel
host cell functions have been described in a variety of
organisms. Some of these examples include regulation of
light signalling in Arabidopsis [29], mammalian neuronal
development [30] and resistance to viruses in mice [23]. A
recent study highlighting this phenomenon demonstrated
that inactivation of a retrotransposon-like element in
mice leads to embryonic lethality due to placental defects
[31]. Thus, a complex evolutionary interplay appears to
exist between genomic silencing of transposon elements
to prevent their proliferation, and co-option of transposon-encoded proteins to provide novel cellular functions
in higher eukaryotic genomes.
Previous studies have implicated downstream insertion of
TEs into functional genes as a major mechanism for TE
rescue (in the absence of an incoming promoter element),
co-option and the formation of chimeric proteins of novel
function. There are numerous examples of such insertions

make them ideal target sites for the integration and
ectopic transcription of opportunistic parasitic transposable elements. In support of this supposition, our analysis
of co-opted TEs and rescued gene-trap cassettes revealed
that all such insertion events occurred within the vicinity
of CpG island regulatory regions. Additional support
comes from the use of a synthetic DNA transposon, Sleeping Beauty, as a mutagenesis tool in mammalian
genomes. From over 1,000 insertion events mapped in
human and mouse cell lines, a small but significant insertion bias towards the 5' upstream regions of genes has
been reported [32].

ment, pre and activity and CpG island
Transcriptionalpost insertion of TIGD1 genomic environTranscriptional activity and CpG island genomic
environment, pre and post insertion of TIGD1. (A)
Promoter region of the mouse Eif4e2 gene shows a predominantly unidirectional grouping of cap analysis gene expression (CAGE) tag transcription start sites in the plus direction
(brown vertical bars) together with some detectable activity
in the minus direction (blue vertical bars). (B) After the insertion of the TIGD1 element in the primate lineage, the human
TIGD1-EIF4E2 promoter region displays a lengthening of the
CpG island and bidirectional transcription of the TIGD1 and
EIF4E2 genes, blue and brown vertical bars, respectively. The
Riken CAGE transcription start sites are overlayed on a
1,500 bp window for mouse and human genome assemblies
mm5 and hg17, respectively.

in mammalian genomes. However, our analysis suggests
that a more common mechanism of genomic TE cooption involves insertion of an incoming TE upstream of
a host gene, oriented in an antisense direction, to form
novel bidirectional gene pairs. Further, this appears to
occur primarily at genes regulated by CpG-containing promoters, with expression and maintenance of TE integrity
facilitated by the inherent bidirectional transcriptional
capacity of CpG promoter regions.
Permissive chromatin environment for insertion and
transcription of transposable elements
The majority of CpG islands within mammalian genomes
exist in an unmethylated state and are associated with
constitutively active genes [17,18]. This state is associated
with an open chromatin structure that is thought to
render the underlying DNA accessible to various chromatin associated proteins involved in the transcriptional
process. We postulated that the majority of CpG islands
within mammalian genomes show inherent bidirectional
capacity, which coupled with their open chromatin state,

CAGE tag and other expression analyses have shown that
CpG island promoters display a broad and complex distribution of transcription start sites when compared to nonCpG island promoters [33,34] possibly contributing to
the observed inherent bidirectional potential. Transcription factors like Sp1 can bind at multiple sites and protect
the CpG island promoter from being silenced [35-37]. In
contrast, when a TE inserts into a non-CpG island or inactive chromatin region, then it is usually silenced via the
cis-spreading of silencing factors and/or the homologydependent RNAi silencing machinery thereby protecting
the host genome from the mutagenic potential of subsequent TE insertions [4,5].

Conclusion
In this study we have described a major molecular mechanism for co-option of transposable elements by host
mammalian genomes involving the antisense insertion
upstream of inherently bidirectional promoters. This does
not affect the integrity of the ancestral gene partner unlike
the related gene fusion events that involve downstream
DNA insertion into existing genes in the same orientation
[1,9]. The net effect of the events we have identified is the
acquisition of an additional (and often novel) gene, predicted to acquire a specific gene expression profile
dependent of the nature of the associated CpG-containing
promoter. Often, the resulting tissue specificity of expression from the incoming DNA element is correlated with
its bidirectional partner gene. In many instances such
genes carry out essential functions within host organisms
and have therefore been 'domesticated' by the host during
evolution [7,8]. This appears to be frequently associated
with the divergence of specific mammalian lineages during evolution. Further studies on the role of co-opted TEs
are warranted to determine the exact roles each plays in
mammalian development and speciation.

Methods
Selection criteria for the inclusion of co-opted proteincoding genes in this study
Human and mouse genes were selected as co-opted using
the following criteria. 1) At least 30% of the coding region

Page 8 of 11

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:498

was derived from a known transposable element. Transposable element similarity was determined using PSIBLAST with up to four iterations of the NCBI non-redundant protein database, or direct searches of the Repbase
repetitive DNA database [38]. To avoid false positives,
simple repeat sequences were filtered out. 2) The gene
showed evidence of expression by EST/mRNA cDNA
clones from human and mouse UniGene datasets, build
#216 and #176, respectively. In addition, we used the
Novartis human and mouse tissue gene expression atlas
data sets to confirm the cloned EST/mRNA results [27]. 3)
We limited the classification to protein-coding genes
which were manually annotated and reviewed by RefSeq
or UniProt database curators. Mean and median cDNA
lengths calculated for bidirectional gene pairs and
genome wide genes were retrieved from the UCSC
Genome Browser website [39] using the GenBank accession numbers provided in a previous study of bidirectional gene pairs [13]. The whole genome survey of coopted TEs was limited to human and mouse genomes
since both organisms have extensive expression datasets
and almost completely sequenced genomes.
Definition of a bidirectional gene
A gene pair was classified as bidirectional if the consensus
transcription start sites were within 1 kb of each other. The
major start site peak position was extracted from the
CAGE data sets for human hg17 and mouse mm5 genome
assemblies [40].
Detecting the presence or absence of co-opted genes in
vertebrate genomes
To determine that a co-opted gene was either present or
absent in genomes other than human we used the chained
alignments available at the UCSC Genome Brower
(human hg18 and mouse mm9 assemblies) [39]. The coopted gene plus at least 5 kb of flanking sequence were
used to assess whether it was present or absent in the compared genome. Furthermore, the flanking 5 kb sequence
was searched against the genome sequence datasets to
ensure that the TE insertion had not arisen due to segmental duplication.
Statistical analyses
Chi-squared analysis was used to test the association of
co-opted genes with bidirectional promoters. Pearsons
correlation coefficient was used to determine the level of
correlation between human bidirectional gene pairs from
expression data in 79 human tissues [27]. Expression was
called as present (P) or absent (A) according to the
Affymetrix array analysis tools.
CpG island analysis
CpG islands were detected according to the criteria set by
the UCSC genome browser which is a modification of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/498

[14]. CpG islands were predicted by searching the
sequence one base at a time, scoring each dinucleotide
(+17 for CG and -1 for others) and identifying maximally
scoring segments. Each segment was then evaluated for
the following criteria: GC content of 50% or greater,
length greater than 200 bp, ratio greater than 0.6 of
observed number of CG dinucleotides to the expected
number on the basis of the number of Gs and Cs in the
region of interest.
PCR and sequence analyses
PCR amplification across the junction regions of the
TIGD1 and 4632419I22Rik co-opted genes was performed using HotStar Taq polymerase (Qiagen) using the
manufacturer's instructions. Primate genomic DNA panel
and the rodent DNA panels were obtained from, Coriell
Cell Repositories and Dr Francois Catzeflis, respectively.
Primer pairs for the presence or absence of the TIGD1
gene were; TIGD1-f1 5'-CAGGGCTGCCACAAACCC-3'
and EIF4-r1 5'-GTCGAACTTGTTGTTCATCCTC-3' or
CHRNG-f1 5'-AGCA(A/G)GTTCATTT(T/C)ATTTACTCC3' and EIF4-r1, respectively. Primer pairs for the presence
or absence of the 4632419I22Rik gene were; Brip1-f 5'AATTCGCGCCTCCCGC-3' and 463Rik-r 5'-GCGTCCTCCAGGACTCTTCG-3', and Brip1-f and Ints2-r 5'GGAAATTGTACTTCTTGGCAAGG-3', respectively. PCR
product integrity was verified by either direct DNA
sequencing, or ligating into pGEM-Teasy vector
(Promega) followed by sequencing.
