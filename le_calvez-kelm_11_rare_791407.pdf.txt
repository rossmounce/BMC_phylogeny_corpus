Abstract
Introduction: Both protein-truncating variants and some missense substitutions in CHEK2 confer increased risk of
breast cancer. However, no large-scale study has used full open reading frame mutation screening to assess the
contribution of rare missense substitutions in CHEK2 to breast cancer risk. This absence has been due in part to a
lack of validated statistical methods for summarizing risk attributable to large numbers of individually rare missense
substitutions.
Methods: Previously, we adapted an in silico assessment of missense substitutions used for analysis of unclassified
missense substitutions in BRCA1 and BRCA2 to the problem of assessing candidate genes using rare missense
substitution data observed in case-control mutation-screening studies. The method involves stratifying rare
missense substitutions observed in cases and/or controls into a series of grades ordered a priori from least to most
likely to be evolutionarily deleterious, followed by a logistic regression test for trends to compare the frequency
distributions of the graded missense substitutions in cases versus controls. Here we used this approach to analyze
CHEK2 mutation-screening data from a population-based series of 1,303 female breast cancer patients and 1,109
unaffected female controls.
Results: We found evidence of risk associated with rare, evolutionarily unlikely CHEK2 missense substitutions.
Additional findings were that (1) the risk estimate for the most severe grade of CHEK2 missense substitutions
(denoted C65) is approximately equivalent to that of CHEK2 protein-truncating variants; (2) the population
attributable fraction and the familial relative risk explained by the pool of rare missense substitutions were similar
to those explained by the pool of protein-truncating variants; and (3) post hoc power calculations implied that
scaling up case-control mutation screening to examine entire biochemical pathways would require roughly 2,000
cases and controls to achieve acceptable statistical power.
Conclusions: This study shows that CHEK2 harbors many rare sequence variants that confer increased risk of breast
cancer and that a substantial proportion of these are missense substitutions. The study validates our analytic
approach to rare missense substitutions and provides a method to combine data from protein-truncating variants
and rare missense substitutions into a one degree of freedom per gene test.

Introduction
Familial clustering of breast cancer is well recognized,
having been described over 140 years ago [1]; the familial relative risk of breast cancer is on average about twofold and is higher among relatives of patients with earlyonset cases [2,3]. Three classes of breast cancer susceptibility sequence variants with different levels of risk and
prevalence in the population are now well established
[4,5]: rare high-risk variants, such as protein-truncating
mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, PTEN and TP53 (Mendelian Inheritance in Man numbers (MIMs) 113705,
600185, 601728 and 191170, respectively); rare intermediate-risk variants, such as protein-truncating mutations in ATM [6,7], BRIP1 [8], CHEK2 [9] and PALB2
[10,11] (MIMs 208900, 605882, 604373 and 610355
respectively); and, more recently, common modest penetrance variants such as the risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detected by genome-wide association
studies (GWASs) in FGFR2, TOX3 (TNRC9), MAP3K1
and LSP1 [12-14] (MIMs 176943, 611416, 600982 and
153432, respectively). High-risk variants in the known
major breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1, BRCA2,
TP53 and PTEN account for approximately 20% to 25% of
the familial risk of breast cancer, and adding the known
intermediate-risk genes increases the proportion by perhaps 1% for each gene [15]. Moreover, the panoply of
known modest-risk SNPs account for about 8% of the
familial relative risk [16]. Thus known genetic effects
account for about one-third of the familial relative risk of
breast cancer, leaving two-thirds unaccounted for, a phenomenon referred to as the “problem of missing heritability.” Some of this so-called missing “heritability” is of
course due to the familial component of environmental
risk factors; the measured surrogates for these factors
probably explain about 5% of the familial relative risk, but
if measured more specifically and more precisely, they
may explain considerably more familial aggregation [17].
The gene CHEK2 encodes a serine/threonine kinase,
CHK2, that functions in the signaling pathways activated
by DNA damage, particularly DNA double-stranded
breaks [18]. Inheritance of a CHEK2 protein-truncating
mutation such as the relatively well investigated Northern European founder mutation c.1100delC confers a
two- to threefold increased risk of breast cancer, an
increased risk of a number of other cancer types and
perhaps a decreased risk of some smoking-related cancers [9,19-21]. Some missense substitutions in CHEK2
also alter cancer risk, as exemplified by the Ashkenazi
CHEK2 missense substitution p.S428F and the Slavic
substitution p.I157T [22-26]. Most large-scale genetic
studies of CHEK2 conducted to date have focused on
genotyping known variants, such as founder mutations.
Consequently, there has been little opportunity to assess

Page 2 of 12

the role of the potentially more numerous, rarer variants
of this gene.
During the 1990s, linkage analysis proved to be an
effective genome-wide approach for finding high-risk
susceptibility genes for breast and colon cancer. Over
the past few years, GWASs have proved to be an effective genome-wide approach to finding common, not
necessarily causal, SNPs associated with modest risk.
Case-control mutation screening, or its quantitative trait
homolog of comparative mutation screening of individuals from the opposite ends of a trait spectrum, is
emerging as a useful strategy for identifying and characterizing intermediate-risk susceptibility genes
[6-8,10,27-29]. While case-control mutation screening
has been, to date, too technically demanding to examine
a whole biochemical pathway, let alone the entire
exome, one can imagine combining exon hybridization
capture and massively parallel sequencing to accomplish
such a study design. Beyond the laboratory challenge
imposed by the implied scale of resequencing, a second
challenge is to conduct a statistically powerful analysis
of the large number of rare sequence variants that
would be revealed if such a study design were applied to
a common disease such as breast or colon cancer. Previously, we used data from mutation screening of ATM
in breast cancer patients and controls to demonstrate
the ability to detect evidence of pathogenicity from both
truncating and splice junction variants (T+SJV) and rare
missense substitutions (rMS) [7]. Here we apply the
same analytic strategy to CHEK2 and then extrapolate
the results to determine the requirements for much larger-scale studies.

Materials and methods
Ethics statement

The CHEK2 mutation-screening studies and analyses
described here were approved by the institutional review
board (IRB) of the International Agency for Research on
Cancer, the University of Utah IRB and the local IRBs
of the Breast Cancer Family Registry (Breast CFR) centers from which we received samples. All participants
gave written, informed consent.
Subjects

Patients were selected from among women gathered by
population-based sampling by the Breast CFRs at three
centers (Cancer Care Ontario, the Cancer Prevention
Institute of California (formerly the Northern California
Cancer Center) and the University of Melbourne) [30].
Patients were recruited between 1995 and 2005.
Selection criteria for cases (N = 1,313) were diagnosis
at or before age 45 years and self-reported race or ethnicity plus grandparents’ country of origin consistent with

Le Calvez-Kelm et al. Breast Cancer Research 2011, 13:R6
http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/13/1/R6

Caucasian, East Asian, Hispanic/Latino or African
American racial or ethnic heritage.
The controls (N = 1,123) were frequency matched to
cases within each center on racial or ethnic group, with
age at selection not more than ± 10 years difference the
age range at diagnosis of the patients gathered from the
same center. Because of the shortage of available controls in some ethnic and age groups, the frequency
matching was not one-to-one in all subgroups.
Mutation screening

Mutation screening started from whole-genome amplified (WGA) DNA for coding exons 1-9 and from genomic DNA for exons 10-14. A nested polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) strategy was used, followed by high-resolution melting (HRM) curve analysis [31,32] and then
dye terminator resequencing of samples that contained
a melt curve aberration indicative of the presence of a
sequence variant. For CHEK2 amplicons harboring
SNPs with a frequency ≥1% in either the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database (dbSNP) [33] or initial
amplicon testing, we applied a simultaneous mutation
scanning and genotyping approach using HRM curve
analysis to improve the sensitivity and efficiency of the
mutation screening [34]. The laboratory process used
was the same as that described in detail for our recent
case-control mutation screening for ATM [7], except
that primary PCR assays for CHEK2 exons 10-14 (which
are involved in a subtelomeric repeat) relied on a longrange PCR assay as described by Sodha et al. [35].
All exonic sequence variants, plus splice junction consensus sequence variants that reduced splice junction
sequence similarity to the standard consensus sequences
AG^GTRRGT (donor) or Y16NYAG^ (acceptor) (where
^ indicates the position of the splice junction), were
reamplified from genomic DNA for confirmation of the
presence of the variant. Because of the presence of pseudogenes that partially matched the sequence of the
CHEK2 long-range PCR exons (exons 10-14), sequence
variants identified within these exons were subsequently
tested using allele-specific PCR assays for the primary
PCR to confirm that the sequence variants initially identified were true CHEK2 variants. To ensure amplification of the CHEK2 DNA sequence and not amplification
of the potentially interfering CHEK2 pseudogenes, the
positions of the specific primers were chosen so that the
3’ extremity bases perfectly matched the CHEK2 wildtype sequence, while they mismatched the corresponding position of the pseudogenes.
All samples that failed at the primary PCR, secondary
PCR or sequencing reaction stage were reamplified from
WGA DNAs or genomic DNA. Samples that still did
not provide satisfactory mutation-screening results for
at least 80% of the CHEK2 coding sequence were

Page 3 of 12

excluded from further analyses (n = 24). Process and
data management of the mutation screening were carried out as described by Voegele et al. [36]. Primer and
probe sequences are available from FLCK upon request.
Alignments and scoring of missense substitutions

Previously, we used the T-Coffee (Tree-based Consistency Objective Function for alignment Evaluation) software suite of alignment tools [37,38] to prepare a CHK2
protein multiple sequence alignment in which the most
diverged sequence was from sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) to analyze a small number of CHEK2
missense substitutions and in-frame deletions [39]. We
updated this alignment by replacing the partial pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis) sequence with a full-length
zebrafish (Danio rerio) sequence and including predicted
CHK2 sequences from elephant (Loxodonta africana),
platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), tunicate (Ciona
intestinalis) and fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster). The
alignment was characterized by (1) determining percentage sequence identity between each pair of sequences
in the alignment, (2) using the Protpars routine of Phylogeny Inference Package version 3.2 software (PHYLIP;
free software developed by Felsenstein [40]) to make a
maximum parsimony estimate of the number of substitutions that occurred along each clade of the underlying
phylogeny and (3) recording the “median sequence conservation score” reported by the missense substitution
analysis program Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant
(SIFT) [41,42]. The sequence alignment, or updated versions thereof, is available at the Align-GVGD website
[43]. Missense substitutions observed during our mutation screening of CHEK2 were scored using the AlignGVGD [43-45] and SIFT [41,42] software programs with
our curated alignments and with Polymorphism Phenotyping version 2 software, or PolyPhen-2, using its precompiled alignment [46,47].
Statistical analysis and power calculations

To assess risk associations using the case-control frequency distribution of T+SJVs and rMSs, we constructed a single table with one entry per participant;
zero or one rare sequence variant per participant; and
annotations for type of sequence variants, study center,
case-control status, race or ethnicity, and age. For the
two participants who carried more than one rare variant
of interest (one participant carried p.I448S (C15) plus p.
E394D (C35), and one participant carried p.E239K (C15)
plus p.R346H (C25)), only the variant belonging to the
more likely evolutionarily deleterious grade (that is,
higher C-number as scored by Align-GVGD) was
considered.
Most analyses were performed using multivariable
unconditional logistic regression using Stata version 11

Le Calvez-Kelm et al. Breast Cancer Research 2011, 13:R6
http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/13/1/R6

software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Differences in the case-control ratio between ethnic groups
and age categories were accounted for by including categorical variables for each age category and ethnic group.
Adjustment was also made for study center. We
explored the possibility of interactions between ethnic
group and study center, checking both improvement of
model fit by the likelihood ratio statistic and comparing
the estimates of the parameter of interest (log odds ratio
(OR) per Align-GVGD grade) in different models.
Adjustment for ethnic group should also capture confounding of genetic and social factors with interaction
terms, allowing that this confounding effect may be different for the broadly labeled ethnic groups in different
centers. Because the Breast CFR matched cases and controls for age in 5-year categories, and because the maximum age of Breast CFR patients included in this study
was 45 years, all participants ages 41 years and older (at
diagnosis for patients and at ascertainment for controls)
were combined into a single age category.
Logistic regression trend tests were formatted such
that participants who did not carry any T+SJV or any
rMS, as well as carriers of the seven grades of rMSs
(C0, C15, C25, C35, C45, C55 and C65) defined by
Align-GVGD [45], were assigned the default row labels
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, respectively. These row labels
were then used as a continuous variable in the logistic
regression analyses. Regression coefficients and trend
test P values (Ptrend) were estimated from the resulting
lognormal ORs using the logit function of Stata software. Carriers of T+SJVs were analyzed against the
same noncarrier group defined above. Two strategies
were used to combine evidence of association with
T+SJV and rMS variants: (1) carriers of T+SJVs were
combined with carriers of C65 rMSs in category 7, and
(2) T+SJV carriers were assigned row label 8. We used
the Fisher’s exact test to obtain the lower bound of the
95% confidence interval (95% CI) for associations with
categories that contained one or more patients but zero
controls.
Post hoc power calculations were performed by specifying a hypothetical OR and population prevalence
for each class of variant, together with the cumulative
probability of breast cancer prior to age 70 years. The
ORs and control carrier frequencies that we specified
for the individual grades of sequence variants, relative
to the noncarriers, were based on data from the population-based Breast CFR sample series. For the grades
for which there were a reasonable number of observations, that is, C0, C15, C25, C65 and T+SJV, we used
the adjusted ORs and observed carrier frequencies.
Because of the very low numbers of observations in
grades C35-C55, ORs for these categories were estimated from the logistic regression OR coefficient and

Page 4 of 12

population carrier frequencies defined to obtain the
specified OR, given the number of observations in
patients. On the basis of these OR and frequency estimates, we calculated expected values and variances of
the test statistics for the types of test considered: Pearson’s c2 test for the two-category tests and the Wald
statistic from a logistic regression for the trend test.
We then calculated the probability of these statistics
exceeding a series of desired P value thresholds using a
normal approximation.
Attributable fractions were estimated according to the
method described by Greenland [48], and familial relative risks were estimated according to the methods
described by Goldgar [49]. Both calculations used the
same frequency and risk association estimates as those
used for the post hoc power calculations.

Results
Number of subjects included in the analysis

Of the 2,436 Breast CFR participants, 24 (10 patients
and 14 controls) were excluded because their PCR failure rate for CHEK2 mutation-screening amplicons was
greater than 20% (Table 1). The distributions of the
remaining cases and controls by age, race or ethnicity,
and study center are detailed in Table 2.
Analysis of protein-truncating variants

Full open reading frame mutation screening of CHEK2
revealed three distinct nonsense substitutions and four
distinct small insertion deletion variants that should
result in a truncated protein. One of these, c.1100delC,
a well-known Northern European founder mutation that
has been shown beyond any reasonable doubt to confer
a moderately increased risk of breast cancer [50], was
observed in 11 patients compared with three controls.
The other six protein-truncating variants were observed
once each, always in a patient (Supplementary Table S1
in Additional file 1). The overall OR associated with T
+SJVs was 6.18 (P = 0.005) (Table 3). However, as
1100delC genotyping has already been reported for most
of the Breast CFR participants included in this study
[50,51], we note that the combination of the other six

protein-truncating variants was marginally significant by
itself (P = 0.033), but since none of this set of controls
were found to carry such a variant, we could not estimate the OR.
Analysis of rare missense substitutions

In the course of this mutation screening, we observed 34
distinct CHEK2 missense substitutions (Supplementary
Table S1 in Additional file 1). The majority (24 of 34) of
these were observed once each. The most common one,
p.I448S, was observed 10 times, and none had an overall
frequency greater than 1% in this sample series. Overall,
42 of the patients carried one rMS, 2 of the patients carried two rMSs, and 17 controls carried one rMS. Thus,
there was a significant excess of rMS carriers among the
patients (OR = 2.20, P = 0.010).
To analyze the rMSs in more detail, we prepared and
characterized a protein multiple sequence alignment
containing CHK2 sequences from seven mammals, three
additional vertebrates, two additional deuterostomates
and one protostomate. Ordering the nonmammalian
sequences by decreasing identity to human CHK2 and
sequentially assessing overall sequence diversity, the
alignment exceeded a maximum parsimony estimate of

Page 5 of 12

an average of three substitutions per position upon
inclusion of the sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) sequence (Supplementary Table S2 in Additional
file 1). Three substitutions per position was suggested as
a criterion of sequence diversity for analysis of missense
substitutions, and we have adopted it as our criterion
for use with Align-GVGD in case-control mutationscreening applications [7,52,53].
Using this alignment, we scored the 34 missense substitutions with Align-GVGD [43-45] and SIFT [41,42]
(Supplementary Table S1 in Additional file 1). Rather
than generating a binary classification, Align-GVGD
categorizes missense substitutions into seven grades
ordered from evolutionarily most likely (C0) to least
likely (C65) [45]. Align-GVGD scored 14 of the rMSs as
C0, with 12 patients versus 9 controls carrying a C0
rMS as their highest-grade CHEK2 variant. The OR for
this grade of rMS was near 1.0 (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.55
to 3.56) (Table 3). In contrast, five different rMSs scored
as C65, with nine patients versus one control carrying a
C65 rMS (again, as their highest-grade CHEK2 variant).
The OR for C65 rMSs was 8.75 (P = 0.044) (Table 3).
Exploiting the intrinsic ordering of the Align-GVGD
grades, we performed a logistic regression test for loglinear OR trends across noncarriers and carriers of the
seven grades of rMSs. This test yielded a lognormal OR
increase of 0.33/grade (Ptrend = 0.0055) (Table 4). Thus
the statistical evidence in favor of pathogenicity from
the trend test was stronger than that generated by either
the binary test over all the missense substitutions or the
test for any individual grade of missense substitution.
These results include adjustments for age category,
study center and ethnic group. Neither the removal of
the study center nor the inclusion of interactions
between center and ethnic group changed the first two
digits of these estimates. The interaction terms did not
significantly improve the model fit (P = 0.18) and were
omitted. While removing the study center did not significantly reduce the goodness of fit (P = 0.12), this adjustment was retained on the grounds of prior plausibility.
We emphasize that our preplanned rMS analysis was
based on rMS grading using Align-GVGD with a
CHEK2 protein multiple sequence alignment having an
average of at least three substitutions per position and
in which the farthest diverged sequence was from the
(deuterostomate) sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus). Our analysis thus conformed to the conditions
under which Align-GVGD was calibrated and was used
to grade missense substitutions in ATM [7,45]. In addition to the pre-planned Align-GVGD analysis, we carried out corresponding analyses on the basis of rMS
grading with SIFT [41,42] and PolyPhen-2 [46,47]. With
SIFT, we set up three rMS grades: (1) the program’s
standard likely neutral grade of SIFT score >0.05, (2) a

sequence conservation score threshold of 3.25, the OR
for the SIFT score 0.00 grade was 3.03 and the logistic
regression trend test gave Ptrend = 0.012 (Table 3). Using
the slightly less informative alignment in which the
most diverged sequence was from the sea urchin, the
logistic regression trend test gave Ptrend = 0.014 (data
not shown). PolyPhen-2 uses a combination of its own
precompiled protein multiple sequence alignments and
crystal structure information to score missense substitutions. Using PolyPhen-2, we also set up three rMS
grades: (1) the program’s standard “Benign” grade, (2)
its standard “Possibly Damaging” grade, and (3) its standard “Probably Damaging” grade. The OR for the Probably Damaging grade was 3.87, and the logistic
regression trend test gave P trend = 0.0070. The rMS
grades obtained with SIFT and PolyPhen-2 are also
included in Supplementary Table S1 in Additional file 1.
One question that arises from this approach to missense substitution analysis is whether the rMSs that
drive the difference between patients and controls are
truly evolutionarily unlikely, which is shorthand for
“subject to purifying selection such that they are disproportionately unlikely ever to become fixed as major

Le Calvez-Kelm et al. Breast Cancer Research 2011, 13:R6
http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/13/1/R6

alleles.” To address this question, we waited until after
our primary protein multiple sequence alignment had
been created and the rare human missense substitutions
had been scored, then we assembled an additional mammalian CHEK2 gene model (from Guinea pig, Cavia porcellus). Insertion of the C. porcellus CHK2 sequence into
our alignment and comparison with the other placental
mammalian CHK2 sequences revealed 34 C. porcellusspecific amino acid substitutions (that is, apparently
wild-type C. porcellus CHK2 amino acid residues that differ from the residues present at that position in the other
placental mammalian CHK2 sequences). We then scored
these residues with Align-GVGD as if they were amino
acid substitutions in the human CHEK2 sequence. All 34
scored C0, the most evolutionarily likely grade and the
grade that contributes least to the difference that we
observe between breast cancer patients and controls.
Simulating and scoring all possible single-nucleotide substitutions to the canonical human CHEK2 cDNA
sequence, we found that 57.2% of possible missense substitutions are C0. Taking into account differing probabilities of these substitutions due to their underlying
sequence contexts as estimated by dinucleotide substitution rate constants [54], 58.6% of a random draw of missense substitutions would be C0. Therefore, ignoring the
effects of purifying selection, the probability that 34 of 34
C. porcellus-specific substitutions would be C0 is
~0.586 34 = 1.3 × 10 -8 . Thus selection acts against the
rMSs of grade >C0. As these grades have sequentially
increasing leverage (toward C65) on the test for trends,
evolutionarily unlikely rMSs indeed drive the observed
difference between patients and controls.
Combined evidence

Looking forward to candidate gene studies, it could be
useful to combine evidence from both T+SJVs and
rMSs. The loglinear OR trend test provides a simple
mechanism by which to achieve this end: observations
of T+SJVs can either be combined with observations of
the highest grade of missense substitutions (C65s) or we
can add an eighth (even higher) carrier grade for the
T+SJVs. For this data set, combining T+SJVs and C65
rMSs in grade 7 appeared to be slightly more effective:
lognormal OR increased by 0.29/grade (Ptrend = 8.8 ×
10-5) as opposed to 0.26/grade (Ptrend = 1.1 × 10-4) with
the alternative approach. The important point is that
the data were less compatible with chance when combined than when they were considered as either T+SJVs
or rMSs alone.
Extrapolation to pathway and whole-exome case-control
mutation-screening projects

Massively parallel sequencing has evolved to the point
where it is being used to identify susceptibility genes for

Page 7 of 12

rare diseases, and one can imagine study designs where
it could be used to identify or characterize intermediaterisk susceptibility genes for common diseases. Using
rare variant carrier frequencies of 0.0045, 0.0018,
0.00021*, 0.00011*, 0.00090 and 0.0027 for the rMS
grades C15, C25, C35*, C55*, C65 and T+SJV, respectively, as well as ORs of 1.82, 2.47, 3.74*, 7.24*, 8.75 and
6.18 for the same series of grades, we estimated the
number of participants required for a reasonably powered many-gene case-control mutation-screening study.
(Note that these frequency and OR values were taken or
calculated directly from Tables 3 and 4 unless marked
with an asterisk; marked values were estimated from the
lognormal OR regression coefficient given in Table 4
and the number of observations in patients.) Setting a
Bonferroni-adjusted P value threshold of 0.0005 for a
study of the ~100 genes in the DNA double-stranded
break repair and allied cell cycle checkpoint pathways,
we estimate that ~2,000 cases and a similar number of
controls would be required for 80% power in a combined analysis of T+SJVs and rMSs (Table 5). An analysis based on T+SJVs alone would require 3,400 each of
patients and controls, and an analysis based on rMSs
alone would require 4,700 each of patients and controls.
Setting a P value threshold of 2.5 × 10-6, which might
be considered appropriate for a whole-exome study,
3,350 each of patients and controls would be required
for 80% power.

Discussion
That protein-truncating variants in CHEK2 confer a
moderately increased risk of breast cancer is well established. The OR that we observed for T+SJVs is numerically somewhat higher than that reported in the 2004
CHEK2 Breast Cancer Case-Control Consortium study
of c.1100delC [50], but not significantly, as our 95% CIs
do include the point estimate from that study. Moreover, as previous studies have observed higher ORs for
c.1100delC in familial versus sporadic cases and in

early-onset versus later-onset cases [9,50], we should
expect that this study’s focus on early-onset breast cancer cases with oversampling of familial cases would
result in relatively high OR estimates.
Previous studies have shown that some CHEK2 missense substitutions are pathogenic, but the scale of their
contribution to breast cancer susceptibility relative to
that of T+SJVs is not known. Although we hesitate to
extrapolate our current data to true population-attributable risks (within the age groups that we sampled) or
familial relative risks, the data do provide a basis on
which to compare the relative contributions of these
two classes of variants. Working from the control carrier
frequencies and the OR point estimates (adjusted for
race or ethnicity, study center, and age) observed from
the population-based Breast CFR sample series, we calculate attributable fractions of 0.014 for T+SJVs as compared with 0.015 for the sum of C15-C65 rMSs. In
addition, we calculate a familial relative risk among
first-degree relatives of 1.036 for T+SJVs as compared
with 1.033 for a product across the C15-C65 rMSs.
Thus, as a first approximation, the attributable fractions
and familial relative risks of truncating variants and rare
missense substitutions are virtually identical. It is important to remember that these attributable fraction and
familial relative risk point estimates are inflated compared with those that would be obtained from a population-based study that included patients diagnosed in
their 70s or older. In addition, as more than 25% of the
T+SJVs observed in this study were nonsense and frame
shift mutations other than c.1100delC, these data also
speak to the importance of full open reading frame
mutation screening to observe the majority of genetically relevant sequence variants in this cancer susceptibility gene.
Several of the missense substitutions observed in this
study have been subjected to functional assays in one or
more published works. For the 14 missense substitutions
that Align-GVGD scored C0 and which we would consequently predict to be neutral or nearly so, assay results
have been reported for 4 (p.P85L, p.R137Q, p.R180H
and p.T323P). Using a Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad53
complementation assay, Shaag et al. [22] found that p.
P85L is equivalent to wild-type CHEK2. While Bell et al.
[55] found this allele to have modestly reduced activity
in an in vitro kinase function assay, both Bell et al. and
Shaag et al. concluded that the allele is effectively neutral. Sodha et al. [39] assayed the p.R137Q allele and
found that it encodes a protein with normal stability
and normal response to DNA damage. Bell et al. [55]
also assayed the p.R137Q allele and found that it has
normal kinase activity. In addition, Sodha et al. [39]
assayed the p.R180H allele and found that it encodes a
protein with slightly reduced stability but normal

Page 8 of 12

response to DNA damage. Thus existing functional
assay results for these three variants are consistent with
their being either neutral or at most weakly pathogenic.
Wu et al. [56] found the fourth C0 substitution, p.
T323P, to have moderately reduced autophosphorylation
and Cdc25C kinase activity. Classification of this substation as C0 is probably a true Align-GVGD error,
because the crystal structure of the protein reveals that
T323 is located in an a-helix, which would not typically
be permissive of substitution to proline. The algorithmic
problem is that the atomic composition and polarity of
proline (the amino acid side chain characteristics considered by the original Grantham difference [57] and
Align-GVGD are atomic composition, polarity and
volume) are intermediate between those of threonine
and isoleucine, which are the two amino acids observed
at position 323 in our alignment. The consequence is
that proline is only slightly outside the range of variation represented by these two wild-type residues and is
consequently predicted to be neutral or nearly so.
Although unpublished, misclassification of substitutions
to proline that map within an a-helix is a problem that
we have observed before and is an obvious issue to bear
in mind when considering missense substitution analyses made using Align-GVGD. p.I157T is perhaps the
most interesting of the substitutions observed in our
study that have been subjected to functional assays.
Align-GVGD scores the variant as C15, indicative of
modest evidence in favor of pathogenicity. Initially, Lee
et al. [58] found that kinase activity of the p.I157T allele
was comparable to the wild type. More recent studies
have reported that the allele is at least partially defective
in dimerization and autophosphorylation, binding and
phosphorylating Cdc25, and binding BRCA1 [59-62]. In
populations in which p.I157T and c.1100delC are both
present at appreciable frequencies and have been subject
to independent risk estimates, p.I157T does appear to
confer increased risk of breast cancer, but the OR or
penetrance associated with the missense substitution
appears to be more modest than that associated with
the frame shift c.1100delC [63]. At the other end of the
spectrum, of the five C65 substitutions that we
observed, only one, p.R117G, has been subjected to
functional assays. Summing across several studies, the
protein encoded by this allele is phosphorylated by
ATM in response to DNA damage, shows slightly to
markedly reduced autophosphorylation, probably fails to
oligomerize and has severely compromised kinase activity toward Cdc25C [39,56,62]. Therefore, the p.R117G
allele encodes a functionally defective protein and is in
all likelihood pathogenic. Thus, for the missense substitutions that were observed in our mutation-screening
study and subjected to functional assays, there is a qualitative trend toward agreement between the Align-

Le Calvez-Kelm et al. Breast Cancer Research 2011, 13:R6
http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/13/1/R6

GVGD classification and the functional assay result,
consistent with the trend in ORs that we observed
across the Align-GVGD-defined ordered series of missense substitution grades. However, since concordant
results between in silico assessments and functional
assays are not yet considered sufficient for formal clinical classification of missense substitutions observed in
BRCA1 and BRCA2 [64-66], it does not appear that the
state-of-the-art of CHK2 functional assays has reached
the point at which concordant results from an in silico
assessment and a functional assay would be sufficient
for clinically relevant classification of a CHEK2 missense
substitution.
The genetic results described in this work, combined
with the above functional assay summary, have implications for potential clinical genetic susceptibility tests
that might include CHEK2 and other genes with similar
mutation profiles. In the 2003 American Society of Clinical Oncology Policy Statement Update on Genetic Testing for Cancer Susceptibility, the second and third
“indications for genetic testing for cancer susceptibility”
were that “2) the genetic test can be adequately interpreted, and 3) the test results will aid in diagnosis or
influence the medical or surgical management of the
patient or family members at hereditary risk of cancer”
(pp. 2398) [67]. With regard to the third criterion, some
investigators have argued that in the context of a highrisk family, the difference in risk between carriers and
noncarriers of clearly pathogenic CHEK2 sequence variants is sufficient to justify a difference in cancer surveillance strategies [68-70]. However, our results in addition
to similar work regarding ATM [7,71] point toward an
issue under the second criterion. If roughly one-half of
the genetically relevant risk that the test can pick up
actually resides in rare missense substitutions that will
be considered unclassified variants at their initial detection, it may not currently be possible to adequately
interpret the test results. Therefore, while it is now
technically feasible to design a massively parallel sequencing-based test that can accurately and relatively inexpensively identify mutations in a panel of breast cancer
susceptibility genes that includes ATM and CHEK2 [72],
it may be inappropriate to introduce such a test into
widespread use before a clinically validated method of
assessing unclassified missense substitutions in these
genes has been developed.
The rare missense substitution analysis model combining Align-GVGD with the logistic regression test for
trends grew out of the in silico analysis of missense substitutions that has now become a standard component
in the integrated evaluation of unclassified variants in
BRCA1 and BRCA2 [65,73]. We proposed the model on
the basis of clinical BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutationscreening data and then demonstrated its effectiveness

Page 9 of 12

by an analysis of ATM case-control mutation-screening
data [7,45]. Thus the CHEK2 analysis presented here
stands as a methodological confirmation of our
approach to the inclusion of rare missense substitution
data in case-control mutation-screening studies. The
logistic regression test for trends that we used also provides a simple approach to combining evidence from
rare missense substitutions with evidence from proteintruncating sequence variants to build a more complete
and statistically powerful approach to assessing casecontrol mutation-screening data than would be afforded
by either method alone. From a technological perspective, we can envision combining exon capture and massively parallel sequencing to extend case-control
mutation screening to entire biochemical pathways and
beyond. On the basis of our post hoc power calculations,
at least 2,000 patients and 2,000 controls would be
required for a whole pathway (such as DNA doublestranded break repair and allied cell cycle checkpoints)
study, and 3,300 patients and 3,300 controls would be
required to undertake a whole-exome study. On the one
hand, these numbers could be an underestimate because
CHEK2 might be among the most important (in terms
of familial relative risk) of the intermediate-risk class of
breast cancer susceptibility genes. On the other hand, it
could turn out that a test based on observations of evolutionarily unlikely sequence variants has an intrinsically
lower false-positive rate than anonymous marker
GWASs and consequently would not require a full Bonferroni multiple testing correction to reasonably constrain the rate of false-positive results.

Conclusions
This case-control mutation-screening study of CHEK2
shows that the gene harbors many different rare pathogenic sequence variants, a substantial proportion of which
are missense substitutions. From a clinical perspective, the
risk of breast cancer conferred by some pathogenic
sequence variants in CHEK2 may be great enough to be of
use in a clinical cancer genetics setting, and we note that
the technical capability of offering a multigene breast cancer susceptibility testing panel at relatively low per gene
laboratory cost is in place. Yet, our results with both
CHEK2 and ATM suggest that such a test would create a
severe burden of unclassified missense substitutions and
that a large fraction of the genetically relevant risk would
reside in those unclassified missense substitutions. Paradoxically, on the basis of the research perspective of susceptibility gene identification and characterization, this
study validates our approach to the analysis of rare missense substitutions observed during case-control mutation
screening and provides a method to combine data from
protein-truncating variants and rare missense substitutions
into a one degree of freedom per gene test.
