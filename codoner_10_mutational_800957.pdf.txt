Mutational dynamics of murine
angiogenin duplicates
Francisco M Codoñer2, Silvia Alfonso-Loeches3, Mario A Fares1,4*

Abstract
Background: Angiogenin (Ang) is a protein involved in angiogenesis by inducing the formation of blood vessels.
The biomedical importance of this protein has come from findings linking mutations in Ang to cancer progression
and neurodegenerative diseases. These findings highlight the evolutionary constrain on Ang amino acid sequence.
However, previous studies comparing human Angiogenin with homologs from other phylogenetically related
organisms have led to the conclusion that Ang presents a striking variability. Whether this variability has an
adaptive value per se remains elusive. Understanding why many functional Ang paralogs have been preserved in
mouse and rat and identifying functional divergence mutations at these copies may explain the relationship
between mutations and function. In spite of the importance of testing this hypothesis from the evolutionarily and
biomedical perspectives, this remains yet unaccomplished. Here we test the main mutational dynamics driving the
evolution and function of Ang paralogs in mammals.
Results: We analysed the phylogenetic asymmetries between the different Ang gene copies in mouse and rat in
the context of vertebrate Ang phylogeny. This analysis shows strong evidence in support of accelerated evolution
in some Ang murine copies (mAng). This acceleration is not due to non-functionalisation because constraints on
amino acid replacements remain strong. We identify many of the amino acid sites involved in signal localization
and nucleotide binding by Ang to have evolved under diversifying selection. Compensatory effects of many of the
mutations at these paralogs and their key structural location in or nearby important functional regions support a
possible functional shift (functional divergence) in many Ang copies. Similarities between 3D-structural models for
mAng copies suggest that their divergence is mainly functional.
Conclusions: We identify the main evolutionary dynamics shaping the variability of Angiogenin in vertebrates and
highlight the plasticity of this protein after gene duplication. Our results suggest functional divergence among
mAng paralogs. This puts forward mAng as a good system candidate for testing functional plasticity of such an
important protein while stresses caution when using mouse as a model to infer the consequences of mutations in
the single Ang copy of humans.

Background
Angiogenin (Ang) is a 14 kDa protein that belongs to the
pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase) superfamily [1-3], and
is involved in angiogenesis by inducing the formation of
blood vessels [3,4]. Ang is over-expressed in tumoral
cancer cells [5] and inhibition of Ang function through
protein-protein interactions blocks the establishment,
progression and metastasis in mice [6-11]. Ang may

function as a tRNA-specific ribonuclease that binds to
actin on the surface of endothelial cells; once bound,
angiogenin is translocated to the nucleus, promoting the
endothelial invasiveness necessary for blood vessel formation. The biomedical importance of this protein has been
recently pinpointed by studies that have associated point
mutations in Ang to neuro-degenerative disease as in the
case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [12-14].
Human Ang (hAng) has been widely studied and has
been the first to be isolated from human colon adenocarciroma cells [15]. Crystallization of the hAng protein
in 1994 [16] has been instrumental for many molecular
and biomedical studies, however little insight has been

achieved regarding the structural and functional constraints on Ang mutational dynamics. Despite the
important function of Ang, and therefore its expected
evolutionary conservation, many research groups found
this protein to be evolutionarily variable, probably linked
to the divergent function between hAng and angiogenin
from other organisms. For example, hAng exhibits a
ribonucleolytic activity that is weaker than bovine pancreatic RNase A, around 105 to 106 times less efficient
[17-19], probably due to a single amino acid substitution
at position 117 of the protein [20]. It cleaves preferentially on the 3’ side of pyrimidines and follows a transphosphorylation/hydrolysis mechanism when inducing
angiogenesis, differing not only in magnitude but also in
the specificity for the bovine pancreatic RNaseA.
Whether the angiogenin functional plasticity is correlated with an evolutionary plasticity remains to be
tested. To conduct this test it is important to define the
set of functional domains and amino acid sites that provide Ang its function and to identify the evolutionary/
functional potential of this protein–which refers to the
potential of this protein to evolve towards novel functions. Functional and comparative structural analyses
have been paramount to unravel key sites for Ang function (See for example, [16,21-23]). Many of these studies
have specifically assigned functions to particular amino
acid sites within the Ang protein. For example, His13,
Lys40 and His114 have been shown to be essential in
the catalytic activity of Ang [24-26].
Mouse is the model used to study the implications of
mutations at Angiogenin in some human illnesses and
studies of murine Angiogenin (mAng) have highlighted
a burst of other amino acid sites essential for its activity
including: i) the B1 binding site comprising Thr44 and
Ser118 [16]; ii) the poorly conserved B2 binding site,
that binds a purine ring on the opposite side of the scissile bond, with Glu108 being key at this functional
domain [16,26]; iii) the P2 site that facilitates, in conjunction with B2 binding site, the binding of Ang to the
nucleus of the cell owing this activity to the amino acids
Arg5 and His8 [27]; and iv) another putative binding
site that has been described to be required for Ang
activity, covering the range of residues Asn59 to Asn68,
residues Ala108 to Phe110 and residue Asn119. Previous
studies pointed to the possible implication of some of
these residues (for example residues Glu58 to Lys70) in
the binding of Ang to the cell and in causing aggregation rather than purine binding as in the case of RNaseA [28,29]. In addition to these regions, there is a
nuclear localization signal that spans amino acids
Arg31-Leu35 of mAng [30].
Due to the variable copy numbers for mAng generated
by gene duplication, mAng become a questionable
model to infer the effect of mutations in hAng, because

the functional constraints on amino acid sites in Ang
may have changed after gene duplication. This problem
is magnified in mice for which six different Ang paralogs genes have been so far described (mAng1 to
mAng6), all resulting from tandem duplications of the
hAng ortholog (mAng1). Only four out of the six copies
(mAng1 to mAng4) have been tested for activity.
Among these, mAng1, mAng3 and mAng4 present a
ribonuclolytic and angiogenic activity (Nobile et al.,
1996; Fu et al., 1999; Crabtree et al., 2007a).
Sites involved in Ang activity have been identified
through comparative structural analyses and functional
data [31-33]. Moreover, mAng2 has been reported to lack
angiogenic activity and has been considered to be a
pseudo-gene [31]. To date, no function has been reported
for either mAng5 or mAng6. Recent studies have provided
evidence for the action of diversifying selection post-dating
the duplication events that gave rise to five of the mAng1
paralogs [34-37]. Adaptive evolution has also been found
in the duplicated gene of Ang from rats (rAng) [36] and
primates [38-40]. Aside from these studies, exhaustive analyses of evolutionary dynamics and structural constraints
at this gene in mice remain unperformed.
Here we present an evolutionary study of the duplicated
Ang genes in mice to identify amino acid regions that may
have played key roles in its functional diversification. We
test for the fixation of adaptive amino acid replacements
after mAng duplication events to identify shifts on the
functional constraints of amino acids after gene duplication and we explore the structural consequences of such
shifts. We finally discuss on the putative functional roles
of the different Ang proteins in mouse based on our evolutionary analyses.

Results and Discussion
Evolutionary history of Ang

The aim of this study was to understand the evolutionary
dynamics post-dating the different duplication events in
mAng. The phylogenetic position of mAng was paramount to infer accurately the evolutionary processes corresponding to each of the multiple duplication events.
Maximum-likelihood approach identified JTT with a heterogeneous distribution of substitution rates among sites
(gamma: Γ, with a shape parameter a = 0.939) as the best
evolutionary model to use in Ang alignments. We tested
the support of the phylogenetic position of mAng in two
ways. In the first method we inferred the bootstrap support values for each of the node using 1000 alignment
pseudo-replicates and inferring the support for each of
the nodes. The resulting phylogenetic tree (Figure 1) supported five mouse specific repeated duplication events,
while a single duplication could be reliably assigned to
the rat lineage (Figure 1). The second approach involved
the comparison of the likelihoods for the four alternative

Figure 1 Phylogenetic reconstruction of the Angiogenin protein. The topology was inferred by maximum likelihood approach implemented
in the PHYML program using the settings for the best evolutionary model, JTT + Γ (where the shape parameter a of the gamma distribution
was estimated to be 0.939). Values at the nodes are bootstrap supports based on 1000 pseudo-replicates. Only bootstrap values greater than
70% are shown.

phylogenetic positions of mAng. These comparisons were
performed using the Hasegawa-Shimodaira (HS) test
[41], which is implemented in the program PAML
version4. This test pointed to the tree of figure 1 as the
most likely hypothesis for the position of mAng1 (for
example, this tree minimizes the log-likelihood value of
the tree) given our alignments (data not shown). We
therefore used this topology in all our downstream evolutionary analyses.
Among the most interesting observations when examining the tree of figure 1 is that repeated ang gene duplication events occurred during the radiation of murine and

rat clades (Figure 1). These duplication events led to the
asymmetric expansion of the Ang proteins in both these
lineages with the mouse lineage showing a substantial
amount of paralogs (6 paralogs corresponding to five
duplication events) as compared to the rat lineage, which
showed only two paralogs (Figure 1). Rat paralogs present
symmetric branch lengths and hence equal evolutionary
rates. Unlike rat, mice paralogs show substantial differences in their evolutionary rates (for example, mAng2,
mAng6 and mAng4 present long branches compared to
their paralogs) hinting their possible functional divergence
after gene duplication. The nature and consequences of

this functional divergence are elusive and more analyses
are needed to determine whether such divergence led to
neo-functionalisation or sub-functinalisation of the paralog copies. Mice present large effective population sizes in
comparison to human and hence the probability for neofunctionalisation in mice is greater than in humans. Theoretical and population genetics data predict that in large
populations strong constraints act against slightly deleterious mutations, hindering the subsequent fixation of compensatory mutations, and consequently the probability of
sub-functionalisation is lower than that of neo-functionalisation [42]. Regardless the final outcome, asymmetry
between mice paralogs point to the fixation of burst of
mutations by adaptive evolution, which may have driven
mAng copies to angiogenin functional diversification. The
asymmetry in mice angiogenin paralogs is substantial,
but what is the selective value of this asymmetry? and
What changes have been essential for mAng functional
diversification?
Diversifying selection has driven the evolution of
mAng copies

To identify events of diversifying selection in the murine
angiogenin, we applied the maximum likelihood based
models implemented in the program CODEML of the
PAML package. In addition, we applied the parsimony
sliding window approach implemented in the program
SWAPSC. This second approach was convenient for
several reasons: i) The sliding window approach allows
identifying regions of the proteins under diversifying
selection, or other non-neutral selective constraints such
as accelerated rates of evolution and mutation hotspots;
and ii) SWAPSC accounts for nucleotide bias and for
non-neutral evolution of synonymous sites.
Maximum likelihood based approach supported a heterogeneous distribution of the intensities of selection
throughout the phylogeny, as pinpointed by the fact that
free-ratio model outperformed significantly the model
of Goldman and Yang (Likelihood Ratio Test value LRT =
c2 = 115.12, P = 4.77×10-7). Using the intermediate Model
B implemented in CODEML, we tested the direct hypothesis of the evolution of each branch before and after duplication events in mice (branches that were tested are
indicated in Figure 2). Model B identified several of the
branches to have undergone different selection constraints
before gene duplication compared to after each of the several gene duplication events. SWAPSC also detected the
action of adaptive evolution in specific branches of the
tree convergently with maximum likelihood analyses. For
example, Branch A (Figure 2), which leads to the ancestor
of all the duplication events in the murine lineage, and
Branch G, which leads to mAng6, were found to be under
positive selection using both approaches. Positive selection
at these branches was supported by non-synonymous-to-

Page 4 of 14

synonymous rates ratio of ω = 2.3058 and ω = 5.65 in the
case of Branch A and ω = 1.731 and ω = 1.16 for Branch
G, as computed by maximum likelihood and sliding
window analyses, respectively.
Branch F (Figure 2), which leads to the ancestor of
mAng3 and mAng5, was detected to be under positive
selection using CODEML as the estimated ω = ∞ was
greater than one, although synonymous changes were
estimated to be 0 and therefore we should be careful in
interpreting this result. In Branch A we found several
sites under PS, including amino acids spanning the
region between Met30 and Gly34. Importantly, this
region includes the sites responsible for the nuclear
localization of the protein [43]. At Branch G several
sites were found to be under positive selection using
both approaches, including residues Ser52 to Gly62.
Although the functional importance of some of these
amino acids is as yet unknown, some of the residues
detected to have undergone positive selection have been
reported to be close or directly involved in the nuclear
localization region of mAng (for example amino acids
included in the region Arg31 to Leu35) [43]. This could
be an indication that functional divergence of mAng6
was due to positively selected amino acid replacements
at these sites.
Inspecting the rest of the branches leading to the different duplicates we found that branch H, which leads
to mAng3 (Figure 2), seems to have been evolving
under negative selection, with ω = 0.1912 and ω =
0.1329 for maximum likelihood and sliding window,
respectively. In contrast some branches such as branch
D, which leads to the ancestor of mAng3, mAng5 and
mAng6, seems to have been evolving neutrally (ω =
0.951). Similar results were obtained for branch E (ω =
1.015), that corresponds to the mAng4 lineage and
branch I (ω = 0.964), that leads to mAng5. This neutral
evolution points to the possible non-functionalization of
these copies, but as mAng4 and mAng3 have been
shown to be functional, we expected mAng5 to be functional as well; we show further analysis that point to
this hypothesis as the most plausible one.
Interesting was the case of branch C, mAng2 (Figure 2),
because it seems to have been evolving at the same rate
(ω = 0.618) as the rest of the species included in the phylogenetic analysis (ω = 0.556). It has been described that
mAng2 is a possible pseudo-gene, however we have not
detected any evidence for relaxed constraints in this lineage in comparison with other lineages of the mammalian
tree that could suggest neutral fixation of amino acid
replacing nucleotide substitutions (for example ω = 0.556
< < 1). Conversely, mAng2 seem to have undergone
moderate purifying selection.
Gene’s expression is one of the main factors affecting
evolutionary rates, with expressed genes being those

highly conserved. To account for this when comparing
non-synonymous-to-synonymous rates ratios among
mAng gene copies we investigated the expression of
each of the copies using codon adaptation index (CAI)
as a proxy to gene expression. CAI was calculated using
the webpage http://www.cbib.u-bordeaux2.fr/pise/cai.
html. The values of non-synonymous-to-synonymous
nucleotide substitutions are not due to different expression levels of the gene copies because, on average, the
different mAng copies presented similar expression
levels (CAI was estimated to be 0.245, 0.235, 0.232,

0.247, 0.243 and 0.237 for mAng copies 1 to 6, respectively). These gene copies also presented similar expression levels to that of hAng (CAI = 0.262). Difference in
evolutionary rates therefore was not due to differences
in expression levels among duplicates.
The fact that these copies remain in the proteome of
mouse argues against previous studies suggesting nonfunctionalisation [31]. In addition, all post-duplication
lineages presented similar intensities of selection except
the pairs of post-duplication lineages F-G (leading to
mAng6 and ancestor of mAng5-mAng3 respectively)

Codoñer et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:310

and H-I that lead to mAng5 and mAng3, respectively
(Figure 2). The elevated ω values are more consistent
with shifts in the evolutionary rates after gene duplication and with the possible functional divergence of the
resulting paralogous copies. In the first pair (F-G
lineages), both post-duplication lineages underwent
adaptive evolution (for example ω > 1) indicating the
possible functional divergence type II (as defined in
[44]). Functional divergence type II involves a change of
the ancestral amino acid at a particular amino acid site
of the protein after gene duplication. This replacement
involves the fixation of two different residues in the
post-duplication lineages and their high conservation
after the speciation of each of the copies due to their
different but equally important functional role in each
of the paralogs. Conversely, both post-duplication
lineages in the second pair (H-I) evolved under purifying
selection, although mAng5 presented significantly accelerated rates of evolution compared to mAng3, indicating
possible functional divergence type I (as defined by
[45]). Unlike functional divergence type II, type I
involves the fixation of a function conferring residue
mutation in one of the paralogs where it becomes highly
constrained, while this amino acid sites evolves neutrally
in the other where amino acid replacements occur with
no functional consequences.
Co-evolution between residues proximal to functional
regions in Ang

Relaxed selection is a common phenomenon after gene
duplication and it can take place in one or both copies
of the gene because of gene redundancy [46,47]. One of
the gene copies therefore may accumulate deleterious
mutations while the other copy can remain under strong
purifying selection to preserve the ancestral function.
The most expected fate for one of the gene copies is
non-functionalization followed by its disintegration
within few million years of evolution depending on the
effective population sizes of the organism [48]. The two
copies of a gene can persist in the genome either if the
combined function of both paralogs performs the ancestral function (sub-functionalization) or if one copy
reproduces the ancestral function while the other
diverges towards other functions (neo-functionalisation).
Survival of a pseudo-gene in the genome for long evolutionary periods is very unlikely, and therefore copies
that remain are likely to be functional. However, evolution of gene copies after duplication can be very complex and up to twelve models have been recently
proposed to account for all possible evolutionary scenarios [49]. Based on this assumption, we examined
whether the mAng gene copies that were kept in the
genome were followed by functional divergence after
duplication. Functional divergence is likely to happen in

Page 6 of 14

two ways: i) classic functional divergence involves the
accumulation of functionally innovative advantageous
mutations in one of the gene copies [44,45]; or alternatively ii) after gene duplication functionally innovative
but structurally destabilizing mutations may have
become fixed once they have been compensated for by
other mutations (compensatory co-evolution): in a normal physiological background the effect of both two
mutations is neutral but the phenotypic advantage of
the destabilizing mutation may be expressed under
novel environmental conditions.
Applying the method of Gu [45] we could not identify
classical functional divergence in any of the considered
clusters. To identify the second type of functionally
divergent mutations we first performed analysis of coevolution (see Material and methods for details). The
co-evolution method identified several pairs of amino
acids showing correlated changes. Groups of coevolution
–with each group including only amino acids that present correlated evolution with each and all the members
of that group (Table 1)– highlighted several amino acid
sites to be correlated in their evolutionary patterns
(Table 1). Most of the sites are close (for example
within 4Å) to essential amino acids of the active site
(His13, Lys40 and His114), or to the binding sites, or to
the domain responsible for the nuclear translocation
(Arg31-Leu35). These proximities support the possible
compensatory relationship between such amino acid
sites because their proximity to important functional
regions makes it likely that mutations at these sites can
have deleterious effects. The next question we asked
was whether these constraints have undergone substantial changes after gene duplication. To answer this question and the hypothesis of compensatory effects we
analysed the distribution of co-evolving pairs of amino
acid sites in the protein structure and tested their
proximities.
Detection of compensatory mutations

In order to understand the relationships between coevolving amino acids in Ang, we plotted these in the
crystal structure of hAng and asked whether pairs of coevolving residues presented evidence of interaction with
one another. In spite of the fact that mAng1 and
mAng4 have been isolated and crystallized, we used
hAng as a reference structure due to the medical relevance of this protein for humans and because it was
identical to mAng. All other mouse Ang structure
copies have been synthetically modified from the
mAng1 in previous studies. The procedure utilized to
answer this question consisted in determining whether
the pair of co-evolving residues was located within 4Å
from each other, being indicative of their possible functional or structural interactions. Alternatively, for those

distantly located amino acids (presenting a distance
from one another greater than 4Å), we asked whether
they were contacting common amino acids that showed
highly conserved evolutionary pattern (see material and
methods for details). Many of the co-evolving amino
acids presented distances greater than 4Å (Figure 3).
Importantly, most of these amino acids were proximal
to residues that showed a significantly conserved evolutionary pattern compared to the rest of the alignment
(pairwise Poisson distances in the lower 99% tail of the
distances distribution, see methods for details). This
method was used previously with significant success to
identify compensatory relationships between mutations
[50]. The highly conserved sites identified nearby coevolving residues are close to the sites responsible for
the ribonuclease activity and to those involved in the
translocation of the protein to the nucleus.
After examining the different co-evolution groups we
found that groups G9, G10, G12, G15 and G16 (Table 1)
presented pairs of amino acids with strong evidence for
their compensatory effects–that is to say they fall within
4 Å of each other in the protein structure and are therefore likely to present interacting effects. The pair of
amino acid sites Asp41-Lys82 (Figure 3A), classified
within co-evolution group G9 (Table 2), presented evidence of compensatory effects. Asp41 and Lys82 are
involved in dimerization of angiogenine and are closely
located to amino acid regions that interact with inhibitors

Page 7 of 14

and the catalytic centre (Table 2). Another example of
possible compensatory interaction is that presented by
the pair of amino acid sites Lys73-Asn102 (Figure 3B)
that are classified within group G10 (Table 2). Importantly, this pair of amino acids is located structurally
close to the putative binding site (Figure 3). His84-Gln93
and His84-Thr97 where detected as compensatory and
they are in two co-evolutionary groups, G12 (Figure 3C
and Table 2) and G16 (Figure 3E and Table 2). These
sites are close to catalytic sites and are both involved in
binding the inhibitor of angiogenin. The pair His84-Ile89
was also found as a coadaptation pair in G16 (Figure 3E
and Table 2). Another pair Thr97-Ala98, which has been
consistently detected to co-evolve in many of the groups,
also presented evidence for a compensatory relationship
in G12 (Figure 3C and Table 2) and G15 (Figure 3D and
Table 2). Thr97 and Ala98 are involved in angiogenin
dimerization (Table 2). In G15 (Figure 3D and Table 2)
we also found other compensatory mutations Lys82Gln93 and Lys82-Thr97. All compensatory mutations
have been highlighted in red in Figure 3. It is interesting
to notice that, although many of the sites detected to be
under adaptive evolution fall within the same domains of
those co-evolving (for example, sites 30 to 35 which are
within the nuclear localization signal peptide), there was
no match between these two sets of sites. One possible
reason may be purely methodological because both selection and functional divergence analyses have been performed in a qualitatively different manner. In selection
analyses we focused the detection of adaptation on particular lineages of the tree. Conversely, in co-evolution the
entire tree was used which makes it more difficult to
identify selection at co-evolving amino acid sites: pairs of
amino acids that changed in a correlated way in few
lineages may have undergone strong purifying selection
in most of the remaining lineages of the tree. This would
imply that on average these sites would be under strong
negative selection most of the time alternating with
punctual episodic adaptive evolution, which would be
unlikely to be detected by actual selection methods. We
consider therefore both the selection methods and coevolutionary analyses to be complementary approaches
to identify adaptive evolutionary events.
Structural bases of amino acid variability in mAng

To understand the structural basis of amino acid variability among the mAng copies, we modelled threedimensional structures for the different mAng copies
that lack such structure (mAng2, mAng3, mAng5 and
mAng6) by homology using the program 3D-JIGSAW
[51,52]. Several Ang structures are available in the databases, including three belonging to mice (with accession
numbers 2J4T, 2BWL and 2BWK) and many other
belonging to synthetic versions of humans or resulting

from different approaches of crystallization. Two of the
mAng structures belong to mAng1 (2BWL and 2BWK)
but have been crystallized using different protocols,
while a third structure (2J4T) belongs to mAng4. We
however adopted the hAng (1ANG) as a reference to
number all sites because the remaining human structures are highly similar in sequence and structure to
this one. To identify differences among the six copies of
mouse Angiogenin proteins’ structures we used the program CCOMP, which measures the distance between
the mass centres of amino acids of two structures by
the Root Mean Square Deviation [53]. Although we
observed no important differences in the structure
among the Ang copies (for example, all six copies present less than 2Å root mean square deviations from the
first copy; Table 3), our results point to the possible
blockage of the active site in mAng2, which may explain

the lack of mAng1-like activity (Figure 4). The similarity
at the structural level but the difference regarding the
functional site supports the hypothesis of functional
shift after the duplication, which may have given rise to
mAng2 and its departure from an Angiogenic activity.
This result also argues against the non-functionalization
of any of the mouse Ang copies. Unlike mAng2, mAng4
has been previously reported to be active [13,32],
although we observed an important difference in the
structural configuration of the active centre when compared to mAng1–that is to say, the active centre of one
copy was structurally displaced and presented slight
structural differences when compared to the other copy
(Figure 4).
Similarly to mAng2, mAng5 shows a structural departure from mAng1 in the active centre with evidence of
activity blockage (Figure 4). This supports the previously

We identify highly conserved amino acid sites (labeled in one-letter code and using as reference the H. Sapiens sequence) that are structurally close to or within
functionally important regions of Ang protein and that are close (within 4Å) to coevolving pairs with potential compensatory relationships. In bold we highlight
those co-evolving amino acid positions reported to be involved in dimmer formation of hAng, in Italic we remark positions implicated in the interaction with
angiogenin-inhibitor in Human. We finally underscore those positions identified to be important as catalytic sites in hAng, as described in NCBI-IBIS database [78].

observed poor angiogenic activity and the suggested
involvement of mAng in other processes [31].
Finally, our selective constraints analyses show evidence
of adaptive evolution in mAng6. The fact that our structural modelling detects a structurally different active centre in this protein compared to other protein copies where
we detect adaptive evolution suggests functional divergence after the split between mAng6 and the remaining
Ang copies. Furthermore, intra-molecular co-evolutionary
analyses show evidence of compensatory mutations events
located nearby important functional regions of the Ang
protein. For example, Pro18 and Thr36, frequently identified as coevolving with many other residues in the

structure, are probably responsible of the operability of the
active site as its location suggests its role in maintaining
the proper orientation of sites His13 and Thr44 that
belong to the active site. The rest of the pairs of coevolution are mostly surrounding the active site–which comprises amino acids His13, Thr44 and His114. Others are
either included within or surrounding the nuclear peptide
signal (Arg31-Leu35). These results indicate therefore
that, in general, amino acid sites close or included
in important protein domains may have coevolved to
maintain the structural features necessary for the proper
functional activity of Angiogenin. We have also detected
two groups of compensatory mutations in mAng after
duplication. The importance of these sites is further
enhanced by their location in or nearby amino acids
Arg31 to Leu35 that have been described to be involved in
the nuclear localization of the protein in mouse [30].

Conclusions
Even though all the duplicates in mouse are different from
mAng1, and that nothing has been described for mAng5
and mAng6, there is no reason to think that these copies
are non-functional. Remarkably it has been reported the
non-nuclear localization of mAng6. The identification of

positive selection in amino acids involved in the nuclear
localization of the protein may be related to a functional
shift of this angiogenin mouse copy. Moreover, mAng2
seems to be functional in contrast to previous reports.
In conclusion, our analyses yield novel results that shed
light on the mutational dynamics of Angiogenin when
exploring diversifying natural selection and functional
divergence. We present the structural and functional interpretations for these evolutionary dynamics and provide a
list of amino acid sites that are likely to have a functional
impact on the mAng copies suitable for further experimental testing. We also reject the previously supported
non-functionalization of duplicated mAng based on evolutionary and structural analyses and we invite researchers
for a rather more detailed investigation of the roles and
redundancies of duplicated Angiogenin genes.

Methods
DNA and protein sequences

Table 4 contains a list of the accession numbers for the
protein and DNA sequences used in this study.
Sequences were all downloaded from the NCBI database
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov after a BLAST search
(Altschul et al., 1997) using the human angiogenine

(hAng) as the query sequence. Protein sequence alignments were obtained using MUSCLE v3.7, with the
default parameters [54,55]. We then aligned proteincoding nucleotide sequences by concatenating triplets of
nucleotides according to the amino acid alignment
(multiple sequence alignment for nucleotides and proteins are depicted in Additional file 1, Figure S1 and
Additional file 2, Figure S2, respectively).
Phylogenetic reconstruction

A molecular evolutionary model was first fitted to the
protein alignment using PROTTEST 1.0.6 [56]. Phylogenetic trees for proteins were obtained using the PHYML
[57] with the best evolutionary model found in PROTTEST. Confidence of the nodes of the tree was tested by
first building 1000 bootstrap pseudo-replicate alignments using the BOOTSTRAP program implemented in
the PHYLIP package v3.67 (J. Felsenstein, U. Washington, freely available at http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/getme.html). We then used PHYML to
obtain 1000 trees from these replicates. The consensus
tree was obtained using the majority rule approach
implemented in CONSENSE program in the PHYLIP
package.

Identification of selective constraints

To identify the main functional diversifying events in
Ang during the evolutionary radiation of mammals we
analyzed the change in the dynamics of synonymous
(dS) and of non-synonymous (d N) nucleotide replacements. In our study we assumed that dS accumulates
neutrally on average since they produce no amino acid
replacements and are therefore not seen by selection.
Taking into account this assumption, we estimated the
intensity of selection by obtaining the ratio between dN
and dS (ω = dN/dS). This ratio has been regarded as the
most stringent way to identify selection, with ω = 1, ω
< 1 and ω > 1, indicating neutral evolution, purifying
selection and diversifying selection, respectively [58-60].
However, caution is required when measuring selection
using this approach because the stability of RNA molecule secondary structure as well as translational selection may impose constraints on synonymous sites
leading to lower dS values and consequently to inflated
ω estimates [61-64].
To ameliorate the effects of these limitations, we tested
for the presence of diversifying selection following two

main ways. First we used maximum-likelihood models to
identify selective constraints as implemented in the program CODEML of the PAML package v4.0 [65]. Using
this approach, we compared a model assuming homogenous distribution of selective constraints along the protein and the phylogeny (model M0: one ω value for the
entire tree and alignment) to a model assuming an independent ω for each lineage of the tree [66]. These two
nested models (the more complex model includes parameters of the simple model) were compared by the likelihood ratio test (LRT) [67], with twice the difference
between the log-likelihood values of the two models
being compared to a c2 distribution with as many degrees
of freedom as number of branches in the tree -1. Second
we used a parsimony-based approach robust to deviations from the assumption of neutrality of synonymous
substitutions. This parsimony approach was based on the
sliding window procedure previously published [68] and
is implemented in the program SWAPSC version 1.0
[69]. This program uses a statistically optimized window
size to detect selective constraints in specific codon
regions of the given alignment at a particular branch of
the phylogenetic tree that show the evolutionary history
of the sequences under study [68].
Briefly, SWAPSC estimates the expected distribution
of dS and dN by Li’s method [70] from simulated alignments and assuming a Poisson distribution of substitutions. A statistically optimum windows size is then
estimated that makes the detection of adaptive evolution
independent of the windows size. The empirical values
of dS and dN obtained by using the optimal window size
are contrasted with the expected distributions, and several hypotheses regarding the selective constraints acting
on codon regions are tested. We obtained the simulated
alignments needed for the analysis with the EVOLVER
program implemented in the PAML package version
4.0, with the parameters estimated from the true
sequence alignment after running the most appropriated
codon based model in PAML. Finally, we considered
only regions and branches detected under adaptive evolution by those approaches as the true positive results.
Detection of intra-molecular co-evolution

To test for intra-molecular coevolution, we used a
recently developed parametric model [71] implemented
in the program CAPS v1 [72]. The sensitivity of CAPS
to identify coevolution between pairs of amino acid
sites that are functionally linked has been shown to
outperform other methods based on mutual information content or on other models of coevolution [71].
We considered therefore the method to be appropriate
for an accurate detection of co-evolution. This method
has been applied in numerous case studies similar to
the one here conducted [50,71,73,74].

Codoñer et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:310
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/310

Briefly, CAPS compares the correlated variance of the
evolutionary rates at 2 amino acid sites in a protein
alignment, corrected by the time since the divergence of
the 2 sequences they belong to. The algorithm estimates
the synonymous nucleotide pairwise sequence divergence as a proxy for their divergence time. This method
compares the amino acid transition probability scores
between 2 sequences at 2 particular sites, using the
blocks substitution matrix [75]. The significance of the
CAPS correlation values was assessed by randomly pairing sites of the alignment and building a distribution of
correlation coefficients for 1,000,000 randomly paired
sites against which we compared real correlation values.
To correct for multiple tests and data non-independence
CAPS performs a step-down permutation procedure
[76] and corrects the probabilities for the correlation
coefficients of co-evolving pairs of sites accordingly [72].
For co-evolution analyses we used the protein-coding
sequence of Ang and minimized type I error using a
confidence value of 0.01. The structural PDB file for
hANG (1ang, [16]) was used to identify the co-evolving
amino acid positions in the structure (for example, all
the amino acid positions in this study refer to their location in the hAng three-dimensional structure).
Molecular co-evolution between amino acids can be
the result of their structural, functional, interaction, phylogenetic, or stochastic link [77]. Disentangling the different types of coevolution is a difficult task, although a
phylogenetic approach has been suggested as a feasible
way to remove amino acids covariation due to stochastic
noise [71]. Distinguishing between structural, functional,
and interaction co-evolution requires biological information in addition to the mathematical adjustments made
by the method. Accordingly, we used correlated variation in the physico-chemical properties of the amino
acids as a further filter to our co-evolutionary analyses.
Identifying Compensatory Mutational Dynamics in
Angiogenin

Each one of the amino acid sites identified as coevolving
was plotted in the crystal structure of the protein and
the Euclidean distance between them was calculated.
We calculated this distance as the average distance
between the atoms of the amino acid sites as follows:
d=

1
NK

N

K

∑∑

( X i − X j ) 2 + (Yi − Y j ) 2 + ( Z i − Z j ) 2

i =1 j =1

Here N is the number of atoms in amino acid i while K
is that number in amino acid j. X, Y and Z represent the
three-dimensional coordinates of the atoms corresponding
to each of the amino acids. We considered two amino
acids to contact each other when the distance between
their closest atoms was equal or less than 4Å.

Page 12 of 14

Two mutations were considered to have compensated
each other if, in addition to presenting the same phylogenetic pattern (be coevolving), they were located within
4Å from each other in the protein crystal structure.
Also, two amino acid sites can compensate each other
indirectly. For example, if site “A” and site “B” are at
more than 8Å distance but are surrounding (within 4Å)
an important functional site “C”, then changes at site
“A” may affect site “C” which has to be compensated by
changes at site “B”. We also considered these cases to
be in support of a compensatory relationship between
sites “A” and “B”. However, caution must be taken in
making such assumptions because close amino acids,
even though are likely to influence one another, may
not have a compensatory relationship. Conversely,
amino acid sites distantly located in the protein structure may have indirect compensatory effects upon one
another. The other limitation of this approach is that
proteins can undergo dramatic conformational changes
during their interactions with other proteins, which is
not reflected in the crystal (static) structure of proteins.
Under these circumstances, amino acids that are distantly located may interact and hence influence one
another. Nonetheless, we adopted the very conservative
view that amino acids interacting in our crystal structures are true interactors at the particular conditions
under which the protein was crystallized. To identify
compensatory relationships under our assumptions
between amino acids at distances greater than 4Å, we
searched for sites contacting both covarying amino acid
sites in the structure showing very low divergence levels
in comparison with the rest of the molecule. We measured divergence levels per site by estimating the Poisson amino acid distances for each amino acid site in the
multiple sequence alignments. The level of divergence
was compared to the distribution of divergence levels
built using a pseudo-random sample of 1,000,000 amino
acid site columns sampled with replacement from the
alignment (one site could be sampled more than once).
Three-dimensional analysis in Angiogenin

3D-JIGSAW program [51,52] was used to model the 3D
structure of the different duplicates. To identify differences among the six copies of mouse Angiogenin proteins’ structures we used the program CCOMP [53],
that measures the Mean Root Square Deviation between
the different structures.
