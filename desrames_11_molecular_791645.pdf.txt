Introduction
HTLV-1 molecular epidemiological studies demonstrated its great genetic stability, with different subtypes/
subgroups, linked to the geographical origin. These
peculiar features can be used as molecular means to
study migrations of HTLV-1 endemic populations.
Although the Caribbean archipelago is a high HTLV-1
endemic area, little is known concerning the HTLV-1
genetic diversity in this region.
Materials and methods
HTLV-1 infected persons, either patients or HTLV-1
asymptomatic carriers, mostly living in Paris area, were
included. Their geographical origin was determined
through interviews. DNAs, extracted mostly from
PBMCs were subjected to PCRs amplifying two LTR
fragments. PCR products were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed.
Results
112 persons were included with 55 from West-Indies, 26
from French Guyana, 23 from West Africa and 8 from
Central Africa. Comparison of the complete LTR indicated that most of the West African strains were of the
Senegal subgroup or West African one (AWA). In contrast and surprisingly, all West Indian strains, except
one, belong to the Transcontinental (TC) subgroup of
the Cosmopolitan subtype. Interestingly, half of the
French Guyanese were infected by a TC strain while the
others (all of Noir Marron origin) were infected by an
AWA strain.

Conclusion
Further studies combining a larger number of samples
from West Indian and West Africa, together with precise historical data are ongoing to gain better insights
into the origin and modes of dissemination of HTLV-1
in the Caribbean and surrounding areas, as well as the
origin of these populations in Africa.
