Abstract
Background: Insertion sequences (ISs) are small, mobile DNA entities able to expand in
prokaryotic genomes and trigger important rearrangements. To understand their role in evolution,
accurate IS taxonomy is essential. The IS4 family is composed of ~70 elements and, like some other
families, displays extremely elevated levels of internal divergence impeding its classification. The
increasing availability of complete genome sequences provides a valuable source for the discovery
of additional IS4 elements. In this study, this genomic database was used to update the structural
and functional definition of the IS4 family.
Results: A total of 227 IS4-related sequences were collected among more than 500 sequenced
bacterial and archaeal genomes, representing more than a three fold increase of the initial
inventory. A clear division into seven coherent subgroups was discovered as well as three emerging
families, which displayed distinct structural and functional properties. The IS4 family was
sporadically present in 17 % of analyzed genomes, with most of them displaying single or a small
number of IS4 elements. Significant expansions were detected only in some pathogens as well as
among certain extremophiles, suggesting the probable involvement of some elements in bacterial
and archaeal adaptation and/or evolution. Finally, it should be noted that some IS4 subgroups and
two emerging families occurred preferentially in specific phyla or exclusively inside a specific genus.
Conclusion: The present taxonomic update of IS4 and emerging families will facilitate the
classification of future elements as they arise from ongoing genome sequencing. Their narrow
genomic impact and the existence of both IS-poor and IS-rich thriving prokaryotes suggested that
these families, and probably ISs in general, are occasionally used as a tool for genome flexibility and
evolution, rather than just representing self sustaining DNA entities.

Background
Insertion sequences (ISs) are small (< 2.5 kb), generally
phenotypically cryptic segments of DNA able to jump, or
copy themselves, into various genomic sites with no need
for DNA homology [1]. They generally encode no functions other than those involved in their mobility,

although elements including additional genes are now
being identified [2,3]. While almost exclusively restricted
to bacterial and archaeal genomes, they are, like eukaryotic transposable elements, involved in a wide variety of
biological transactions leading to genome reshuffling and
evolution. Indeed, their ability to proliferate within a

genome provides the potential for homologous recombination-mediated deletions or inversions, and their capacity to transport accessory genes represents an additional
contribution to genome flexibility. By affecting gene
expression and facilitating the emergence of new gene
clusters they play an important role in adaptability of their
host. Eventually, horizontal transfer mechanisms such as
conjugation allow these IS-mediated sets of genes to cross
barriers between strains, species and beyond [4].
The DNA breaks and joins necessary for transposition are
catalysed by an element encoded protein referred to as
transposase. These proteins determine transposition
mechanisms and are now used to lead classification of
prokaryotic transposable elements in general. Accordingly, transposases that form a covalent intermediate with
DNA are distinguished from those that do not. Additional
distinction is provided by protein active-site residues crucial for transposition. These define the five major transposase classes currently established : tyrosine (Y), serine
(S), relaxase (Y1) and rolling-circle (Y2) transposases
involve covalent intermediates with DNA during transposition, while the fifth class, namely DDE transposases,
prompts transposition via direct transesterification reactions [5-7].
DDE transposases display three acidic residues in three
distinct regions of their primary sequence, namely regions
N2, N3 and C1, which harbor the aspartate (D), aspartate
(D) and glutamate (E) residues, respectively. Spacers of
various lengths separate these regions, but their acidic residues are brought together upon protein folding to form a
catalytic triad essential for transposition [8-11].
Prokaryotic DDE transposons (mainly ISs) can move in
two different ways, depending on the fate of the donor
site. Replicative transposons mobilize a copy of their
DNA, leaving the parent site intact, while conservative
transposons cut themselves out of the donor molecule in
order to paste their DNA into the target [12].
Beyond mechanistic behaviors, each individual IS is characterized by structural features used to fine-tune their classification. A wealth of these data is currently generated
with the rising availability of whole genome sequencing
projects. As of July 2007, more than 19 different IS families are established based on over 1800 bacterial and
archaeal IS sequences [1,13-16]. An IS family can be
defined as a collection of elements sharing the same catalytic site structure (with conserved spacers between key
residues), an identical genetic organization (e.g.
frameshifting in transposase gene), similar arrangements
of their ends and uniform target site fates upon insertion.
However, not all families are so coherent. This is why
some of them (like families IS4 and IS5) are divided into

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/18

subgroups being composed of a core of closely related elements that can be linked to other members of the family
by weaker but still significant similarities.
The IS4 family, like most IS families described so far, contains elements mobilized by DDE transposases performing a 'cut-and-paste' mechanism. The main and almost
only hallmarks of this family's transposases are (i)
absence of frameshift in the transposase gene and (ii) an
Y-(2)-R-(3)-E-(6)-(K) signature (YREK) in region C1
where the glutamate residue is that of the DDE motif
[1,17]. Only very few IS4 elements have been studied in
detail. IS231A has been shown to transpose in vivo by a
'cut-and-paste' mechanism [18], both in its natural host,
Bacillus thuringiensis [19], and in Escherichia coli [20]; and
it displays a certain degree of insertion specificity [21].
Both IS10R and IS50R are part of composite transposons
(Tn10 [22,23] and Tn5 [24,25], respectively) and are the
only members for which in vitro systems have been set up.
The latter has allowed extensive acquisition of genetic,
biochemical, mechanistic and regulation data for these
elements. Also, the Tn5 transposase is the only IS4 element for which X-ray crystallographic structure data are
available [9,26].
Since the initial definition of family IS4 (based on about
45 elements), other elements were progressively added via
ISfinder, the prokaryotic IS database [15]. However, some
of them displayed distant resemblance both to existing
IS4 members as well as members of other groups such as
the IS5 family or ISNCY (IS Not Classified Yet). Some elements even lacked the above mentioned distinguishing
protein motifs. It was therefore necessary to perform a systematic screen for related elements in order to gain a more
rational view of the organization of the IS4 family.
Here we report an extensive in silico search for IS elements
related to family IS4 among more than 500 complete bacterial and archaeal genomes. A total of 227 putative intact
IS4-related elements were collected and permitted a
detailed update of the IS4 catalogue, together with the
description of novel emerging IS families. This allowed
the evaluation of their distribution and impact among
major prokaryotic phyla. Finally, known transposition
mechanisms could be discussed in light of novel primary
sequence data.

Results
Classification process
The present assignment of families and subgroups is primarily based on transposase and DNA end sequence data.
Analysis of transposases was performed by multiple
sequence alignments and clustering methods followed by
dendrogram construction to set up clusters of related proteins (see Methods). Left and right DNA extremities flank-

ing transposase genes were aligned (i) to each other to
facilitate observation of terminal inverted repeats (TIRs)
and (ii) with TIRs from other ISs to detect DNA extremity
conservations. Together, these approaches split the initial
IS set into ten groups. In each of them, the percentage of
residue identity among transposase pairs often varied
between 20 % and 50 %, highlighting the magnitude of
divergence occurring among elements of a same IS group.
The length of TIRs ranged from 10 to 40 bp and many of
them were imperfect. Comparison of TIRs from different
elements of a given IS group uncovered unique and conserved signatures in each of them, illustrating the relationship between the transposase sequence and the IS
terminal repeats (Figure 1).
To validate this clustering, established groups were analysed independently for conservation of specific transposase domains as well as length and specificity of target
site duplications. Analysis of transposase DDE catalytic
regions (N2, N3 and C1) revealed a perfect conservation
of the DDE motif (Figure 2), while the size and sequence
of the spacers that separate these catalytic residues differed
among the ten groups. The YREK motif was partially lacking in three groups, where either its tyrosine, arginine or
lysine residue was not conserved. According to the definition of IS families, IS groups sharing the same catalytic site
structure were assigned together. Seven clusters displayed
the complete YREK motif; and were named subgroups
IS231, ISH8, IS4Sa, IS4, ISPepr1, IS10 and IS50. The three
remaining groups all displayed a distinct variation of the
YREK motif and were therefore assigned to different and
new families, namely IS701, ISH3 and IS1634, referred as
emerging families. Finally, while IS4 family members generated about 10 bp target duplications, i.e. the approximate length of a complete DNA helix turn, those from
emerging families displayed direct repeats (DRs) of
around five bps, which corresponds approximately to half
a DNA helix turn (Figures 1 &3).
Review of family IS4
Family IS4 included 153 distinct intact elements. The
main
hallmarks
were
the
presence
of
D(60~110)D(100~150)E and Y(2)R(3)E(6)K motifs, single orf encoded transposases and target site duplication
lengths corresponding approximately to one DNA helix
turn. Considerable diversity was observed at the level of
transposase regions (sequence and length) outside catalytic residues, DNA end signatures and target site specificity. The following description of established subgroups
will summarize this diversity.

Subgroup IS231 was previously established (reviewed in
reference [2]) and was the most coherent one since many
transposase pairs displayed sequence identity percentages
above 50 (see also Figure 1A). Likewise, their DNA ends

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/18

are among the most conserved. A clear relationship was
observed between transposase and extremity conservation
(Additional file 1). This is particularly true for left extremities (conventionally upstream of the transposase gene)
where transposase-related conservation extended beyond
the TIRs. The IS231 subgroup further distinguished itself
by the fact that its members occurred almost exclusively in
genomes of phylogenetically close bacteria composing the
B. cereus sensu lato group (i.e. B. cereus sensu stricto, B. thuringiensis and B. anthracis, see Additional file 1 and Figure
4). As previously shown, an important hallmark is the
large size range of its elements (Table 1). A significant fraction of them displayed additional DNA between the left
TIR and the transposase gene [2,3], which is still unusual
among ISs. In this study, novel putative passenger genes
were found in these extra sequences coding for resistance,
virulence or metabolism determinants as well as
unknown orfs (results not shown). This modular aspect
has not yet been observed in other IS families or IS4 subgroups, which may be due to the fact that, so far, no systematic and thorough searches for supplementary IS DNA
were carried out in other families.
Subgroup ISH8 was initially included into subgroup IS4Sa
[1]. Yet, our results showed a closer proximity to subgroup
IS231; not only at the transposase level, but also due to
DNA extremity conservations (both displayed conserved
5'-CAT ends, Figure 1B and Additional file 2). ISH8 elements were initially discovered in archaea but recent
genome projects uncovered elements of this subgroup in
proteobacteria. Examination of ISH8 insertions did not
reveal apparent target site specificity, contrary to the one
observed for IS231 elements (Figure 3).
Subgroups IS4Sa and IS4.
This study provided the first thorough description of subgroup IS4Sa that was originally mentioned in reference
[1]. Together with IS4Sa-like elements appeared a closely
related subgroup including element IS4, which provided
the name for this second ensemble. Subgroups IS4Sa and
IS4 were relatively close at the protein level and the major
argument for splitting them in two was a different organization of TIRs (Figure 1B and Additional files 3 &4).
Extremities in subgroups IS4Sa and IS4 displayed relaxed
conservation of the third and first nucleotide, respectively,
which is rather new but not unique in family IS4 (see
below). Some elements of subgroup IS4 displayed spectacular apparent insertion specificity in left and right target arms, a conservation that was also observed for
ISRm22 from subgroup IS4Sa (Figure 3). Both subgroups
were quite diverse and broadly distributed in bacteria.
Rare occurrences were recorded in archaea (ISFac10) and
algae viruses (ISvEsV1_1, see Figure 4 and Additional files
3 and 4).

DDE and YREK motifs of IS4 subgroups and emerging families
DDE and YREK motifs of IS4 subgroups and emerging families. Comparative overview of conserved transposase
regions among IS4 subgroups and emerging families. Each line represents a part of the amino acid consensus obtained from
multiple alignments of members belonging to the displayed IS groups. Numbers in brackets correspond to the mean amino acid
spacer (accompanied by standard deviation) between the two aspartate residues or the aspartate and glutamate residues of the
DDE motifs among transposases form a given group. The conserved transposase regions N2, N3 and C1 are mentioned on top
of alignment. Symbols and colors are used as depicted in keys.

Subgroups IS10 and IS50 were the only ones that did not
cluster together with subgroups IS231, ISH8, IS4Sa, IS4
and ISPepr1 during Tribe-MCL analysis (results not
shown), indicating more distant relationships with these
subgroups. This was also observed at the level of DNA
ends since they systematically displayed 5'-NT extremities
instead of 5'-NA. Yet, they displayed key residue conservation (Figure 2) and target site duplication lengths comparable to typical IS4 elements (Figures 1 &3). So far, the
majority of both subgroups occurred among proteobacteria.
Subgroup ISPepr1 was also newly established here and is
almost exclusively composed of novel elements. Although
it is composed of a limited repertoire, it is already forming
a consistent subgroup with apparent insertion preference
for AT-rich sequences (Figure 3) and, like elements of subgroups IS10 and IS50, it preferentially displays 5'-CT ends
(Additional files 5, 6 and 7), in contrast to 5'-CA extremities encountered in the other elements from family IS4.
Emerging families
Members of Family IS 701 were already considered distantly related to IS4 in reference [1] and this was confirmed here. Only four of the 27 considered IS701
elements displayed the tyrosine of the YREK motif (results
not shown, see Figure 2); and almost all elements dis-

played a highly conserved target site duplication of exactly
four bps (results not shown, see Figure 3). The diversity
emanating from IS701 transposases and TIRs allowed
identification of three distinct clusters (Additional file 8),
which announced a possible division into subgroups. As
indicated by their prokaryotic distribution, family IS701
seemed to be rather widespread (Figure 4).
Family ISH3 was a small group so far restricted to archaea
(Additional file 9). Half of their transposases lacked the
lysine residue of the YREK motif while all (except ISFac10)
displayed a Y-(2)-R-(3)-E-(3)-(R) motif. DRs flanking
ISH3-like insertions are typically five bps long and generally flanked by A at one end and T at the other end.
Family IS1634 was initially named IS1549 [1]. This new
designation should prevent confusion with an emerging
group called IS1595 [13]. Transposases were among the
largest due to relatively long N3-C1 spacers, which were
sometimes twice as long as those from family IS4. Only
five out of 32 displayed the arginine residue of the YREK
motif (results not shown, see Figure 2). This large group
could be divided in (three) distinct clusters according to
transposases (Additional file 10). Target site duplications
were five to six bp AT-rich tracts while DNA ends were
only poorly conserved. They were remarkably diverse in
archaea and relatively widespread in bacteria (Figure 4).

Distribution of copy numbers
Members of the IS4 family were found in 92 out of 540
(~17 %) complete genomes representing 65 prokaryotic
species. Families IS701, ISH3 and IS1634 displayed lower
incidences, being present in ~3 %, ~0.7 % and ~2 % of
available genomes, respectively. 172 of these genomes
included plasmids of which 22 harbored elements of
these families. Figure 5 displays the distribution of IS
genomic copy numbers as it was found on chromosomes
and plasmids. The distribution of family IS4 uncovered a
clear preference for single genomic copies, followed by a
preference for two, three and six to eight copies per
genome. The genomes of Photobacterium profundum SS9,
Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC strain PG1, Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 and the two sequenced strains of
Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae displayed the highest

amounts of elements from families IS4, IS1634, ISH3 and
IS701, respectively (Figure 5). The most IS-rich extrachromosomal replicons were megaplasmids pNRC100 (191
kb) and pNRC200 (365 kb) from Halobacterium sp. NRC1, which harbored together 20 copies of IS4 family elements and 18 copies of family ISH3 elements.
Distribution of IS subgroups and families among
prokaryotic phyla and viruses
The distribution of individual elements among the different bacterial and archaeal phyla is shown in Figure 4. As
indicated by the histogram in Figure 4B, current sequencing projects focus unequally on different prokaryotic
phyla [27]. The distribution presented in Figure 4A partially reflected this sequencing bias, which is why most
gathered elements were found in proteobacteria. Glo-

bally, families IS4, IS701, ISH3 and IS1634 were detected
in eight, seven, two and seven phyla, respectively.
Figure 4A shows that the distribution of individual IS families or subgroups as defined in this study could either be
broad (as for subgroups IS4, IS4Sa and family IS701) or
concentrated in a particular phylum (as for subgroup
IS231 and family ISH3). Interestingly, two copies of an
element belonging to subgroup IS4 were found in the
genome of the brown algae virus, Ectocarpus siliculosus
virus 1 [28]. So far, no IS4-related element was found in
eukaryotes.

Discussion
Impact of IS4 and related families on prokaryotic genomes
The availability of a large number of completely
sequenced genomes on one hand, and the extensive manual characterization of an IS family on the other hand,
allowed a direct evaluation of global presence of its putatively functional members. Family IS4 displayed a sporadic distribution among 17 % of explored genomes.
Moreover, the behavior of these ISs was assessed by determining their genomic occurrence. This showed that
numerous elements exhibited single or low copy numbers, which was in line with the assumption that transposable elements need to compromise between transposition
for self maintenance and limited insertions to keep host
genome integrity [29]. This distribution also displayed a
certain, less pronounced, prevalence for copy numbers
between 6 and 8, although the biological relevance of this
observation remains unclear.

While the global distribution of IS elements was shown to
be rather sporadic, important expansion events were
observed in a few pathogens as well as in some free-living
extremophiles. One of these pathogens is a member of the
facultative intracellular Mycoplasma, of which eleven
genomes are available. 65 intact copies of family IS1634
elements were found together with 17 intact copies of the
IS3 family in M. mycoides [30]. The presence of family
IS1634 was also detected in M. synoviae [31], M. agalactiae
[GenBank:CU179680] and the three strains of M. hyopneumoniae [31,32]. Only M. genitalium [33], M. pneumoniae [34] and M. mobile [35] were devoid of ISs.
Interestingly, the Mycoplasma species lacking ISs were also
those displaying the smallest genomes (between 0,58 and
0,82 Mb), while the IS-rich M. mycoides had a relatively
large genome (1,2 Mbs). A positive correlation between
the total number of genes and the amount of mobile DNA
in a genome has been reported for other facultative intracellular bacteria [36], and a recent study has extended this
observation to other prokaryotes [37]. However, this relationship must be seen as a trend with notable exceptions
(e.g. the large genome of M. penetrans – 1,36 Mbs – has
only 21 transposase genes [38]).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/18

Family IS701 was represented by 70 and 72 elements in
the genomes of two sequenced pathovars of the rice pathogen X. oryzae [39,40]. This family was completely absent
in phylogenetically related species with available genome
sequences, including X. campestris (black rot in crucifers)
and X. axonopodis (citrus canker) [39-43]. Additionally, a
moderate presence of family IS4 was observed in all but
one of the six Xanthomonas genomes (X. campestris pv. vesicatoria), together with other, more expanded families. So
far, all sequenced xanthomonads are IS-rich, which is supposed to provide the necessary flexibility for adaptation to
different plant hosts [40]. Interestingly, each strain is characterized by the expansion of one specific IS family [43].
The IS4 family was also observed to be relatively expanded
in sequenced Shigella spp. where other families, both with
higher and lower expansion levels, were also detected [4447]. These mobile elements are supposed to contribute to
the emergence of variable epidemiological and pathological features among these phylogenetically close pathogens [45].
These observations are reminiscent of IS expansions
observed together with emergence of pathogenicity in
other host associated pathogens, such as Bordetella pertussis (whooping cough [48]), Yersinia pestis (plague [49])
and Francisella tularensis (tularemia [50]).
A different relationship was observed in the genus Vibrio.
The expansion of family IS4 in the non-pathogenic Photobacterium [51] was striking (Figure 5) as compared to
those observed in the pathogenic Vibrionaceae, such as V.
cholerae [52], V. parahaemolyticus [53] and V. vulnificus
[54], that displayed relatively modest IS contents. Therefore, ISs apparently have a quite different role in Vibrio
evolution, where some IS-rich species are non-pathogenic
piezophiles. Other important IS expansions among freeliving extremophiles were observed in one out of three
Sulfolobus spp. [55-57], where family ISH3 represents a
significant fraction of global IS content, as well as in Halobacterium, which harbors numerous copies of IS4 and
ISH3 elements together with other families [58].
Lateral transfer and clade specificity
Analysis of the distribution of individual elements among
prokaryotes and among established families and subgroups was also performed regardless of copy numbers
(Figure 4). Prokaryotic IS hosts were from world-wide origins and covered a large range of lifestyles and habitats,
from free-living environmental germs and extremophiles
to host associated symbionts and pathogens. Evaluation
of emergence on evolutionary timescales, as well as estimation of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) extent
prompted by this distribution remain both problematic
because of low identity levels among transposases. However, many IS4-related elements were found on putative

Page 9 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:18

mobile DNA, including various plasmids (Figure 5), bacteriophages (results not shown) and one eukaryotic virus
(Figure 4). Additionally, most IS4-related subgroups and
emerging families were scattered over several phyla (Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), suggesting an
involvement of HGT in the dissemination of these elements.
Reports on prokaryotic IS distribution have shown that IS
families are not clade-specific and our data regarding family IS4 were in agreement with this assumption. However,
the distribution of IS4 subgroups and emerging families
showed that the number of elements of some IS groups
was not systematically proportional to the extent of
genome sequencing (Figure 4). Subgroup IS231 (family
IS4) was almost exclusively restricted to Firmicutes and 26
of its 32 elements were found among bacteria of the B.
cereus s.l. group. Likewise, family IS1634, and to a lesser
extent family ISH3 and subgroup ISH8, were preferentially found among Euryarchaeota. These observations may
partially be due to insufficient genome data, but they do
not rule out the possibility of existing clade specificity at
the level of IS subgroups. Preferential IS occurrences
among certain prokaryotic phyla or genera can be the consequence of isolated niches reducing or limiting horizontal transfer of hosted ISs. In this case, a series of
extremophilic archaea were almost exclusive hosts of subgroup ISH8 and family ISH3, their preference for harsh
ecological niches may represent a frontier for HGT with
other phyla or with bacteria. Another possible explanation can be based on IS-associated features. It is possible
that the presence of some ISs cannot be tolerated by certain hosts. Uncontrollable transposition behaviors, lack
of target site specificity, preferred insertions into vital
genes or regulatory regions can limit the host compatibility of some ISs for which a viable equilibrium can be
found only in rare 'IS – host' combinations.
Reaction mechanisms
The co-crystal structure of the IS50R transposase binding
the ends of the Tn5 transposon generated function assignments for numerous residues of this protein [9]. A comparative sequence analysis based on 19 transposases was
performed and compared with a previous report on seven
transposases from subgroup IS50 by Reznikoff et al. in
2004 [59]. This confirmed the previous function assignment of conserved residues since most identified domains
were still conserved among this subgroup, as were a series
of residues with unknown function (further results available in Additional file 11).

The primary sequence data concerning the transposase
motifs (Figure 2) and target site duplications (Figure 3)
suggested divergent biochemical behaviors between IS4
transposases and those from the emerging families. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/18

two 3'-OH transposon ends are known to attack the target
helix at opposite sites in the case of IS4. For the emerging
families, the length of target site duplications (5 bp) suggested a different target strand cleavage path: owing to the
structure of B-DNA, this attack needs to come from the
same helix side. It is worth noting that in the case of family IS1634, two elements were reported to display atypical
target site duplication lengths. IS1549 and IS1634, from
M. smegmatis and M. mycoides, respectively, have both
been shown to produce long, variable-length DRs upon
insertion [60,61]. They had lengths between 8 and 514
bps, depending on the copy. So far, no mechanistic model
has been proposed for the generation of this variable target duplication size.

Conclusion
This study consisted in a thorough and systematic screen
for IS4-related elements among available genome
sequence data. It allowed a considerable improvement
regarding the description and definition of family IS4, as
well as the establishment of new IS families which were,
until now, assimilated to the IS4 ensemble (Table 1).
Thus, 22 distinct IS families are now officially established.
Novel primary sequence descriptions were unraveled for
reported families, which will allow easier identification of
other related elements as they will be uncovered with
ongoing genome sequencing projects. This work also
established a link between genomic and functional data
regarding reaction mechanisms, which underlined the
importance of both approaches for a more complete
understanding of transposition biology.
The extent of genomic impact of single IS families showed
that IS4 and its related families are far from being ubiquitous among prokaryotes. This limited IS distribution
applies to most known IS families as reported by a recent
automated survey of bacterial ISs [62]. Significant genome
wide expansions were observed only in a few host-associated pathogens and certain free-living extremophiles, suggesting that particular ISs could have been, at least
partially, implicated in the emergence or evolution of
these particular lifestyles. Yet, the reasons explaining these
sporadic IS demographic explosions remain to be uncovered.
Our interpretation of these results is that the IS families
described here, and probably ISs in general, represent an
evolutionary tool available among several. In order to
provide the necessary genome flexibility for adaptation to
new or variable environments, evolution seems to select
this tool in some cases. In contrast to a purely 'selfish' or
'parasitic' perception of mobile DNA, this view supports
the idea that prokaryotes, and maybe life in general, may
also make use of mobile DNA for its own benefits, rather

than being constantly invaded by it in an uncontrollable
manner.

Methods
Genomic in silico screen for IS4-like elements
This search covered more than 500 complete and partial
bacterial genomes. Only apparently full-length transposases were retained to avoid inclusion of partially
deleted and thus inactivated transposases which can accumulate mutations of functionally important residues.

When we began our search for novel IS4-like elements, the
ISfinder database contained about 70 ISs designated as
'member of family IS4'. First, representative elements
(about twenty) covering most of the sequence diversity of
this family were selected. Primary transposase sequence of
each of these representatives was then used in a BLASTP
search, either among microbial genomes only, or against
all organisms. Since IS4 elements exhibit short TIRs and
generate target site duplications upon insertion (DRs), the
flanking DNA of resulting hits was checked for the presence of these repeats. This, together with DNA extremity
comparison of various elements, allowed the determination of both ends of the collected elements. New ISs were
checked for the existence of formerly registered iso-forms
which we defined as elements with less than 2% divergence in the amino acid sequence of their putative transposases and/or less than 5% difference in their DNA
sequences. ISs were submitted to the ISfinder database,
which provided new names according to the current IS
nomenclature [15].
Bioinformatic procedures
BLASTP searches were performed on the NCBI BLAST
online interface [27] without low complexity filter and
with otherwise default parameters. Each transposase
sequence retrieved a series of protein hits which were possible transposase candidates. The DNA encoding these
candidates was downloaded together with 1000 bps upand downstream regions. These DNA sequences were then
verified for the presence of TIRs flanking the transposase
candidate genes using BLASTN and the PALINDROME
algorithm of the wEMBOSS package at the Belgian
EMBnet Node [63]. If TIRs were present, flanking DRs
were looked for by eye.

The following multiple alignment algorithms were then
evaluated with the resulting ISs for their performance to
accurately align the catalytic D, D and E residues of transposases : Clustal W [64], Dialign [65], Parallel PRRN [66],
Muscle [67], T-Coffee [68] and M-Coffee [69]. Global
alignment of the 227 transposases was made by merging
existing M-Coffee alignments with Clustal W. The following order was applied where pre-existing alignments are
represented by subgroup or family designations flanked

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/18

by brackets and merging procedures by + symbols:
(((IS231)+(ISH8)+(IS4Sa)+(IS4))+(IS10,
IS50,
ISPepr1))+((IS701, ISH3)+(IS1634)). Examination of
resulting alignments and subgroup specific dendrogram
construction (UPGMA, BLOSUM62) were performed
using the Jalview alignment editor [70]. Dendrograms
were drawn with TreeView [71].
In order to facilitate visualization of transposase clusters,
the TRIBE-MCL clustering algorithm [72] was applied to
the complete set of transposases with inflation option (-I)
set to 1,2 and default values for other parameters. These
settings corresponded to those used by the ISfinder [15]
and ACLAME [73] databases.
Evaluation of IS impact on sequenced genomes
587 chromosomes and 363 plasmids, representing 540
individual completely sequenced bacterial and archaeal
genomes, were screened for the presence of IS4, IS701,
ISH3 and IS1634 family DNA. Therefore, the 950 molecules were used as input in BLASTN [74] searches against
a homemade database containing the 227 DNA sequences
encompassing these IS families.

Combining alignment data from subgroup IS50 with functional data from
transposons Tn5. The black sequence is the consensus obtained after multiple alignments of 19 members of the IS50 subgroup with MCOFFEE.
Interrupting dashes indicate alignment gaps. The conservation percentage
is represented by black bars over each position. The dotted line stands for
70% residue conservation. Residues of the IS50R transposase with known
functional data are shown together with their position coordinates. They
are grouped and color-coded following the function they carry out in regulation or during the transposition mechanism. Aspartate and glutamate
residues of the DDE motif are pointed out by white triangles among the
conservation bars. The YREK motif is highlighted by white 'V'. The transpososome formation step (i) is divided into successive stages including initial cis-binding, dimerization, 3'-end & 5'-end trans binding, transbinding via the β hairpin clamp and additional trans contacts. Target capture residues are displayed by (ii), while integration and transposase
release are not shown. Residues annotated as intramolecular inhibition
are supposed to inhibit dimerization of full length transposases. For further
details about these mechanistic concepts, see references [9,25,59]. Each
residue is linked by colored lines to the corresponding position in the alignment consensus. Their designation is colored and bold if the residue is conserved at least at 70%, gray if it is less or not conserved. Conserved
positions with unknown function are pointed out by asterisks (*).
