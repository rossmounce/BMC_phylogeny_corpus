Abstract
Background: A new algorithm for assessing similarity between primer and template has been
developed based on the hypothesis that annealing of primer to template is an information transfer
process.
Results: Primer sequence is converted to a vector of the full potential hydrogen numbers (3 for
G or C, 2 for A or T), while template sequence is converted to a vector of the actual hydrogen
bond numbers formed after primer annealing. The former is considered as source information and
the latter destination information. An information coefficient is calculated as a measure for fidelity
of this information transfer process and thus a measure of similarity between primer and potential
annealing site on template.
Conclusion: Successful prediction of PCR products from whole genomic sequences with a
computer program based on the algorithm demonstrated the potential of this new algorithm in
areas like in silico PCR and gene finding.

Background
PCR technique is widely used in the molecular biology
laboratory. The key step to successful PCR is primer
design. Usually, software for PCR primer design only gives
a subset of candidates, and we must choose the workable
primers empirically. With more organisms' genomes
sequenced and data freely available, we may predict PCR
products with computer programs and evaluate primer
candidates against the target organisms' genomic
sequence prior to performing the PCR in the laboratory.

The most important thing for PCR product prediction is
finding appropriate primer annealing sites on the template. Many attempts have been made to develop computer programs based on different algorithms for this
purpose. Such programs include Amplify [1], simPCR [2],
PCRAna [3], PUNS, and Virtual PCR [4]. PUNS [5] is a
web-based program for PCR prediction, however, it does
not deal with degenerate PCR primer. Some algorithms
for the selection of probes or DNA oligos are also related
to this field, such as longest common factor approach proposed by Rahmann [6], hybridization free energy based

method used by Li [7], Kaderali's work [8] based on an
extended nearest neighbor model, and Lexa's PRIMEX [9].
In our research, we designed a new algorithm based on
information theory. One information source was
obtained by converting the primer sequences to numeric
vectors of the potential full hydrogen bond numbers, and
the second was created as a vector of the actual hydrogen
bond numbers formed between the primer and its potential binding site on the template. An information coefficient was computed for determining the similarity
between the two information sources as a criterion to
locate primer-annealing sites, and predict products. A
computer program, SPCR (Simulated PCR), based on this
algorithm was developed to predict PCR products, and its
performance was evaluated by replicating 4 cases of laboratory PCR experiments in silico, and performing comparisons between the predicting results of our program and
VPCR.

According to equation (1), (2), (3) and (4), we can transform the DNA sequences of primers and CASs into
numeric vectors. Then we can perform the next step, computing the information coefficient (I) for each primer-CAS
pair. The formula for the calculation of information coefficient (I) is as equation (5).
Only those sites where the similarity is higher than a preset threshold were selected as annealing sites if the last
digit in the vector of T was not 0 (a requirement for perfect
match at the 3'-end).
The formula for information coefficient (I) calculation is
as follows:
n

Implementation
The algorithm is based on base digitalization followed by
calculation of information coefficient. Information coefficient we used in this research is a formula based on Shannon's information theory. Shannon's information theory
was ever used in other research concerned on primer
design, e.g. Purohit et al. [10] used entropy measure to
identify conserved regions in aligned sequences for primer
design.
The first step of this algorithm is to find out appropriate
annealing sites from template sequences. Firstly, let the
upstream and downstream primer sequences slide along
template sequences respectively, one base per step. At
each position where 3'-end base of primers match with
the base of templates, a DNA fragment can be acquired
from template sequences which length is the same as
primer length, which we name as Candidates of Annealing Sites (CAS). The primer sequences and CAS fragments
are all converted into numeric vectors. We name the
numeric vectors of two primer sequences as PU and PD,
and fragments of template as TU and TD. They are defined
as below.
PU = [p1, p2,..., pm], PD = [p1, p2,..., pn]
TU = [t1, t2,..., tm], TD = [t1, t2,..., tn]

Variables m and n are lengths of upstream and downstream primers. The pi and ti are defined as below.

P = ∑ pi , T = ∑ t i , D(p, t ) = (p + t )log(p + t ) − p log p − t log t.

The value field of information coefficient (I) is (0,1],
when primer sequence match with template completely,
i.e. P = T, I = 1, and the higher the affinity between primer
and template, the greater the value of information coefficient. Information coefficients formed by upstream
primer and CAS of template are represented as a set Iup;
and accordingly, information coefficients of downstream
primer and CAS are Idn.
For each probable product, a successful amplification was
determined by 5 parameters: upstream information coefficient Iup, downstream information coefficient Idn, estimated limits for product maximum and minimum length,
and product amplification coefficient (Pa) which equals to
an average of Iup and Idn. There are two kinds of average
methods provided in SPCR program, the arithmetic average, i.e. (Iup+Idn)/2, and the geometric average, (Iup*Idn).
We discuss only the geometric average here. Although the
two method of average are different in computation, the
values are close, and will not change the result of prediction significantly. If, and only if, the values of Iup, Idn, and
Pa are all greater than the preset thresholds, and the length
of predicted product lies in the preset length limit, did
SPCR generate a product between upstream and downstream primer annealing sites within the product length
range.

SPCR was implemented as a Win32 application and written in C++ language. It comprises an executable program
that can be run directly without the need for installation.
The user inputs the primer sequences, sets the thresholds,
and provides locally one or more template sequence files,
and push the button "Start PCR" to begin the prediction.
SPCR can recognize degenerate primers encoded with the
IUPAC nucleotide codes. Degenerated base are allowed in
primer sequences. Template sequences can be available
genomic sequence of the target organism, which must be
Single- or Multi-FASTA format. The output of SPCR is a
text file of a list of all predicted PCR products.
SPCR saves all produced data, including predicted products and all parameters, into a user-specified result file in
pure text format. The output file consists of four parts. The
first part is a table in which all of predicted products are
listed, including their Pa value, product length, template it
comes from, direction of amplification, position of beginning and end, Iup and Idn value, and the upstream and
downstream primer sequences. The second part is a digit
indicating the number of predicted products. The third
part is the detailed nucleotide sequence data in FASTA format of all predicted products in the same order as in the
table. The last part includes all parameters set before SPCR
running. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n),
where n is the aggregate length of all the template
sequences. In addition, SPCR provides a function to simulate agarose gel patterns of output data.

Results
To test the performance of the SPCR program, we first
used SPCR to simulate the PCR experiments presented in
the Virtual PCR (VPCR) paper [4].
The SPCR prediction results for ARR5 and ARR7 genes
were identical to the laboratory PCR results, and no
unspecific products were produced (Fig. 1). VPCR gave
one unspecific product for the ARR7 gene and 8 unspecific
products for ARR5. The SPCR prediction for GEN12 and
GEN13 families with degenerate primers gave a predicted
agarose profile similar to the laboratory results. More than
80% of the predicted products had counterparts in the
laboratory PCR results. VPCR predicted only 2 products
for each of the gene families and gave more than 8 unspecific products in each case. Although Lexa et al. has
released
the
2.0
version
of
VPCR
http://
grup.cribi.unipd.it/cgi-bin/mateo/vpcr2.cgi, the predictions of GEN12 and GEN13 are still not as accurate as
SPCR.
We used the universal primer pair P0 and P6 [11] to predict 16S rRNA genes from 59 completed bacterial
genomes. We correctly located all copies of 16S rRNA
genes from 52 of the tested genomes with all threshold

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/190

parameters at 0.85. Predictions for three strains yielded 1
or 2 unspecific products, which were eliminated when the
threshold parameters were increased to 0.86 or 0.9. Discrepancies between SPCR prediction and GenBank data
for three strains were found to be a result of incorrect
annotation of the data. In only one strain was an unspecific product found that was longer than the expected gene
copy.
SOX proteins contain a conserved HMG-related DNA
binding domain, which shares at least 50% identity with
that of SRY. Cremazy [12] designed a pair of highly degenerate primers, which were capable of amplifying a broad
spectrum of SOX HMG sequences. We predicted SOX
HMG sequences from Homo sapiens genome with the
primer pair P5-2 and P3-1 and verified with the BLAST
(blastn) program [13] that the top 10 products were all
known SOX genes.
Two primer pairs for amplification of conserved regions in
polymerase coronavirus genes were used to predict PCR
products from 7 complete coronavirus genomes, including SARS-CoV and 14 other coronavirus species. All predictions yielded the expected products from all templates,
453 bp for primer pair IN-2(+)/IN-4(-) [14] and 251 bp
for 2 Bp/4Bm [15]. Phylogenetic trees based on the predicted products were in agreement with the current taxonomy of coronaviruses.
Besides above cases, we also tested SPCR with successful
prediction of primer pairs for genome-specific amplification of environmental bacteria. Unspecific PCR primers
against bacterial genomes for random amplification of
bacterial community samples also yielded satisfactory
results.
The threshold value of 3 parameters Iup, Idn and Pa are
selected empirically. Increase of the parameter values can
lead to reduction of unspecific products. This corresponds
to increase of annealing temperature for reducing unspecific products in actual PCR. Usually, the 3 parameters
should be greater than 0.8, if a specific PCR is predicted. If
parameters higher than 9.0 still give unspecific products
we suggest change of primer pairs if specificity is a major
concern.

Discussion
Amplification of non-targeted products is a common
problem in PCR experiments, especially when using complex templates, such as whole genomic DNA or mixtures
of genomes. It has been suggested that mismatch tolerance during primer annealing to template is the most
important reason for unspecific PCR products, followed
by primer length, template size, and product size limits
[2]. The current PCR prediction methods are mainly based

on probabilistic theories for similarity analysis between
primer and template, while some other methods are also
used in this field, such as statistical thermodynamics [16]
and string comparisons.
A successful computer program for PCR product prediction should be able to identify all potential annealing
sites. Sequence similarity between primer and template is
the primary factor for selecting annealing sites. In this
work we developed a new algorithm to assess the similarity between primer and template after the base sequences
were converted into vectors of hydrogen bond numbers.
We consider annealing of primer to template a means of
information transfer. The hydrogen bond number vector
for the primer is the source information, while the vector
for template is the target information. The difference
between the two information sources is a reflection of the

fidelity of this information transfer process. Since hydrogen bonds are formed as a result of specific base recognition between the two DNA strands and the total number
of hydrogen bonds is also a major force holding the two
strands together, the similarity between these two information sources may be a good estimate of the probability
of both annealing site selection and annealed structure
stability. The information coefficient calculated in this
work is a measure of similarity between two information
sources. The value varies between 0–1, reflecting complete
difference to 100% identity. In the SPCR program, the
threshold can be increased to reduce expected products,
which is comparable to increasing annealing temperature
to reduce unspecific products in laboratory PCR. In contrast to BLAST, this algorithm tolerates any type of mismatch between primer and template. The successful
prediction of all copies of 16S rRNA genes in complete

genomes demonstrates the potential of using this algorithm for gene prediction of newly sequenced genomes.

Conclusion
In our evaluating cases, the SPCR program is reasonably
good for predicting all potential PCR products with complex templates. This can help the user choose the primer
pair that gives the least possible non-targeted products.
However, the prediction for random PCR products with
SPCR is not satisfactory. When the template is too big, as
the case with the human genome, the running time can
reach 48 hours.
In current version, SPCR do not consider the situation of
insertions and deletions of template sequences, these situations should be considered in future versions. Some
refinements for the algorithm can also be done in future,
for example, considering the effect of base stacking and
alternative penalty for mispairs may improve the accuracy
of prediction.
