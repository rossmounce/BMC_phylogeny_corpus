Abstract
Background: The annual fish Nothobranchius furzeri is the vertebrate with the shortest known life
span in captivity. Fish of the GRZ strain live only three to four months under optimal laboratory
conditions, show explosive growth, early sexual maturation and age-dependent physiological and
behavioral decline, and express aging related biomarkers. Treatment with resveratrol and low
temperature significantly extends the maximum life span. These features make N. furzeri a
promising new vertebrate model for age research.
Results: To contribute to establishing N. furzeri as a new model organism, we provide a first insight
into its genome and a comparison to medaka, stickleback, tetraodon and zebrafish. The N. furzeri
genome contains 19 chromosomes (2n = 38). Its genome of between 1.6 and 1.9 Gb is the largest
among the analyzed fish species and has, at 45%, the highest repeat content. Remarkably, tandem
repeats comprise 21%, which is 4-12 times more than in the other four fish species. In addition,
G+C-rich tandem repeats preferentially localize to centromeric regions. Phylogenetic analysis
based on coding sequences identifies medaka as the closest relative. Genotyping of an initial set of
27 markers and multi-locus fingerprinting of one microsatellite provides the first molecular
evidence that the GRZ strain is highly inbred.
Conclusions: Our work presents a first basis for systematic genomic and genetic analyses aimed
at understanding the mechanisms of life span determination in N. furzeri.

Background

Studies in invertebrate model organisms such as yeast and
worm have identified a number of genes and pathways that
regulate life span and aging [1], and some of these are conserved across taxa [2-5]. While this work has been crucial to
elucidate common aging related pathways like insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling [6-8], in many cases experimentally proven relevance for invertebrate genes/gene
products cannot be reproduced in vertebrates. Also, the comparatively long life span of vertebrate model organisms poses
a difficulty for testing of findings initially obtained in invertebrates - for example, a life expectancy of several years like that
of mouse, rat, or zebrafish renders experimental analyses of
potentially life extending drugs difficult.
The Turquoise killifish, Nothobranchius furzeri, might represent an alternative vertebrate model for the study of aging [9].
The fish inhabit seasonal ponds in South-East Africa and
were first captured in 1968 in the Game Reserve Gona Re
Zhou (GRZ) in Zimbabwe [10]. In 1975, only two pairs of the
direct descendants of these fish were left. One of these pairs
was then used for breeding, mainly to preserve the species for
the killifish community [11]. Offspring of these fish have since
been maintained by dedicated hobbyists and in the following
are referred to as the GRZ strain. The maximum life span of
GRZ fish was previously found to be 12-13 weeks in captivity
[12-14]. In our facility, GRZ fish exhibit a maximum life span
of 16 weeks [15]. The fish show explosive growth and early
sexual maturation, and with advancing age typical aging
related features such as a decline in learning/behavioral
capabilities as well as expression of aging biomarkers are
observed [16,17]. Furthermore, GRZ fish are susceptible to
life span modulation. Maximum life span is significantly prolonged by moderately decreased water temperature and treatment with resveratrol, both of which are characterized by
delayed onset of cognitive decline and expression of aging
biomarkers [13,14]. In contrast to the GRZ strain established
from the game reserve in Zimbabwe, recently established isolates of N. furzeri populations from southern Mozambique
differ in life span and time of expression of age-related traits,
which presumably reflects adaptation to the seasonal duration of their respective ponds [18]. The maximum life span of
these recent isolates is 25-32 weeks. Although this is twice as
long as found for the GRZ strain, it is still exceptionally short
compared to other vertebrates. It also does not seem to
change considerably in captivity - for example, maximum life
span is 32 weeks in the first captive generation of a southern
N. furzeri population collected in 2004 and remains at 31
weeks in the sixth captive generation of the derived strain
[15], which is currently bred in our facility and was termed N.
furzeri MZM-0403 [18]. In addition, there are several other
African Nothobranchius species, which live longer than N.
furzeri, including N. kunthae (37 weeks) and N. guentheri (52
weeks, reviewed in [9]), opening up the possibility to study
naturally occurring aging phenotypes both in N. furzeri and
across Nothobranchius species.

Reichwald et al. R16.2

To date very little is known about the genetic makeup of N.
furzeri and at present one cannot exclude that private mutations or inbreeding cause the exceptionally short life span of
the GRZ strain. However, the presence of aging related
biomarkers and changes in their expression in response to
external stimuli [14,16], as well as a similarly short life span
and visible symptoms of old age reported for GRZ fish 33
years ago [11], argue in favor of the action of common mechanisms of life span determination in this strain.
In order to support establishing N. furzeri as a model organism for age research, we provide here a first insight into its
cytogenetic and genomic characteristics, including karyotype,
genome size/composition, phylogenetic positioning and
genetic variability. We compare its genomic features to those
of medaka (Oryzias latipes), stickleback (Gasterosteus
aculeatus), tetraodon (Tetraodon nigroviridis) and zebrafish
(Danio rerio). These species serve as models in many areas of
contemporary research, such as genome evolution (tetraodon), developmental biology and genetics (medaka,
zebrafish), and speciation (stickleback). Genome projects are
completed or well underway; whole genome analyses have
been published for tetraodon and medaka [19,20], and preliminary genome assemblies have been provided for stickleback and zebrafish [21]. Clearly, the sequences facilitate large
scale and systematic studies [22-24].
Our work is a first step towards a systematic identification of
genes and biochemical pathways involved in life span determination in N. furzeri. Combined with the genetic resources
for the aforementioned fish species it also forms a basis to
make full use of N. furzeri as a model organism for the study
of aging.

Results and discussion
Cytogenetic characteristics
The chromosome number of N. furzeri is 2n = 38 and
includes four pairs of metacentric, three pairs of acrocentric
and twelve pairs of subtelo-/submetacentric chromosomes
(Figure 1a). Based on morphology, there do not seem to be
clearly differentiated sex chromosomes. Specific heterochromatin staining indicates that the cytological organization of
the N. furzeri genome is highly structured as is evident from
the presence of large blocks of C-banding positive heterochromatin in the centromeric region of most chromosomes (Figure 1b). Accumulation of heterochromatin in other
chromosomal sites cannot be detected. To evaluate the composition of heterochromatin, we performed base specific
fluorochrome staining on metaphase chromosomes. Staining
with the A+T specific dye DAPI resulted in poor fluorescence
of centromeric regions (Figures 1a and 2a). Conversely, staining with mithramycin, which shows high affinity for G+C-rich
DNA, generated bright fluorescence in most centromeric
regions that are DAPI dull (Figure 1c). This indicates that constitutive heterochromatin in N. furzeri is G+C-rich. The anal-

ysis of closely related African Nothobranchii, including the
sympatric species N. orthonotus as well as two allopatric species from Tanzania, N. hengstleri and N. eggersi, does not
indicate a comparably structured genome organization (Figure 2b–d). Thus, at the cytological level, a compartmentalization of the N. furzeri genome is apparent which is likely
caused by substantial differences in DNA composition. This
seems unusual since fish genomes are generally characterized
by a very limited compositional heterogeneity [25,26].

Genome size
We sequenced 5.4 Mb of the short-lived strain N. furzeri GRZ,
the long-lived, recently wild-derived strain N. furzeri MZM0403, and the long-lived closely related species N. kunthae
using a whole genome shotgun approach and Sanger
sequencing (Table 1). To assess the genome size of N. furzeri
based on the sequences, we assumed that the number of its
protein coding genes does not differ significantly from that of
other fish species, as was previously suggested for vertebrates
[27]. We identified sequences containing protein coding
information in the 5.4 Mb of both N. furzeri strains by
BLASTX searches in Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL, and did the same

for medaka, stickleback, tetraodon and zebrafish, for which
we extracted adequate genomic samples from public databases. Based on the reported genome sizes of the latter four
fish species, we then deduced the genome size of N. furzeri. In
detail, 444 (8%) of the 5,540 N. furzeri GRZ sequences and
443 (8%) of the 5,686 MZM-0403 sequences show significant
similarity (p < 10-10) to protein coding genes. Respective
sequences comprise 31%, 20%, 13% and 11% of the tetraodon,
stickleback, medaka and zebrafish genomic samples, respectively, which corresponds to a genome size of 1.59-1.92 Gb for
N. furzeri (Additional data files 1 and 2). For experimental
confirmation, we performed flow cytometry measurements
using DAPI and propidium iodide (PI). DAPI, which preferentially stains A+T rich DNA segments, yields a DNA content
of 2.33 pg/diploid cell while the non-base-specific PI staining
results in 3.11 pg/diploid cell (Additional data file 3). In light
of the large blocks of G+C-rich heterochromatin observed in
our cytogenetic studies, the value obtained with PI is likely
the correct one since it is based on a dye that does not depend
on DNA composition, whereas DAPI staining most probably
results in an underestimation of DNA content [28]. The value
obtained with PI corresponds well with our sequence based

estimate; that is, it is equal to a genome size of approximately
1.5 Gb. The 5.4 Mb thus represents roughly 0.3-0.5% of the N.
furzeri genome.
Based on these data, the N. furzeri genome is likely at least
half the size of the human genome, bigger than the four other
fish genomes, and has less chromosomes. At 1.4 Gb (25 chromosomes) [29], the zebrafish genome is slightly smaller,
while medaka (1 Gb, 24 chromosomes [20]), stickleback (0.7
Gb, 21 chromosomes [30]) and tetraodon (0.4 Gb, 21 chromosomes [31]) genomes are considerably more compact.

Genome composition
The G+C content of the 5.4 Mb sample of N. furzeri GRZ is
44.9%. Interestingly, approximately 10% of the sequences
have a G+C content of 60% or higher; in Figure 3a this is indicated by a second peak at approximately 62% in a plot of
number of sequences against G+C content. The same unusual
G+C content distribution is seen in the recently wild-derived
N. furzeri strain MZM-0403 (Additional data file 4). To test
whether this represents an artifact introduced by preferential
propagation of G+C-rich sequences in Escherichia coli [32]
during library preparation, we performed whole genome

shotgun sequencing using Roche/454 Life Sciences technology, which does not involve cloning and amplification in bacterial systems [33], for N. furzeri GRZ. In this second GRZ
genomic sequence sample, the G+C content is 44.3% (111.6
Mb; Table 1). Similar to the Sanger sequences, approximately
10% of the 454 sequences show a G+C content of at least 60%,
which indicates that there is not a strong cloning bias in the
genomic libraries we initially sequenced. Taken together, our
sequence data suggest that a distinct G+C-rich fraction is
present in the N. furzeri genome. A similar fraction does not
seem to exist in medaka, stickleback, tetraodon and zebrafish
(Figure 3b) and is absent as well in the closely related species
N. kunthae (Additional data file 4).
To assess the extent to which our sample-based estimation
reflects the G+C content of the N. furzeri genome, we analyzed entire genomes as well as adequate genomic samples of
medaka, stickleback, tetraodon and zebrafish. We found that
the G+C content estimates of genomes and genomic samples
are essentially the same (Table 2). Our calculations are in
agreement with previously published data; we estimated a
G+C content of 46.4% for tetraodon and reported values are
45.5% [31] and 46.4% [20]; similarly, 40.3% was reported for
medaka [20] and we found it to be 40.5%. Thus, the G+C content of N. furzeri is likely 44-45%, which is similar to stickleback (44.6%), slightly lower than in tetraodon (46.4%) and
considerably higher than in medaka (40.5%) and zebrafish
(36.6%). Based on genomic sequences, an inverse correlation
of genome size and G+C content was recently found for the
latter four fish species [34], which confirmed previous experimental results showing that small genomes are generally
associated with high G+C content and vice versa [25]. N.

furzeri would seem an exception as its G+C content is nearly
as high as that of tetraodon, which has a four times smaller
genome. The sequence fraction in the N. furzeri genome with
the high G+C content (≥60%) increases the global G+C content rather slightly - the value is 43.1% if these sequences are
excluded - and it seems that these sequences occupy defined
chromosomal regions (see below).
While to our knowledge there is no evidence for a direct influence of nuclear genome composition on the life span of a vertebrate species, some reports correlate life span with the
composition of proteins encoded by the mitochondrial
genome. For example, Rottenberg [35] found that rates of
amino acid substitution per site in mitochondrial DNA of
mammals are positively correlated with longevity of a genus
and suggested that the evolution of longevity drove the accelerated evolution of peptides encoded by mitochondrial DNA.
Moosmann and Behl [36] showed that the frequency with
which cysteine is encoded by mitochondrial DNA is a specific
indicator for longevity; that is, longevity is associated with a
depletion of mitochondrial cysteine in aerobic species. It will
be very interesting to analyze the cysteine content in mitochondrially encoded proteins in comparison to nuclear proteins in N. furzeri strains/Nothobranchius species with
different life spans.

Repeats
Repetitive elements can be grouped into the main classes
'tandem repeats', 'transposon-derived interspersed repeats',
'processed pseudogenes' and 'segmental duplications'.
Because our genomic samples comprise rather small, fragmented fractions of the N. furzeri genome, it is impossible to

identify pseudogenes and large complex repeat structures.
Also, the short average sequence length in the 111.6 Mb generated by the Roche/454 technology (100 nucleotides; Table
1) practically rules out a meaningful repeat analysis. We
therefore concentrated on the mere identification of tandem
repeats and transposon-derived interspersed repeats in the
5.4 Mb of both N. furzeri strains and N. kunthae generated by
Sanger sequencing and, for comparison, analyzed our samples of medaka, stickleback, tetraodon and zebrafish
genomes.
We considered as tandem repeats microsatellites, minisatellites and satellites composed of 1-5 nucleotides, 6-99 nucleotides, and over 100 nucleotides per repeat unit, respectively.
About 1% of the N. furzeri DNA is composed of microsatellites, which is comparable with tetraodon (1.1%) and stickleback (0.8%), about half as much as in zebrafish (2%) and five
times more than in medaka (0.2%) (Table 2). Roest Crollius
et al. [31] reported that microsatellites comprise 3.21% of the
tetraodon genome. The higher number is most probably due
to the different algorithms and motif sizes applied; that is,
Roest Crollius et al. used a Smith and Waterman algorithmbased approach previously applied to Takifugu rubripes [37]
and a motif size of 1-6 nucleotides, while we used the program
Sputnik [38], a specific tool for the detection of microsatellites, and a motif size of 1-5 nucleotides.

In N. furzeri, dinucleotide repeats are the most common type
of repeat (37%; Additional data file 5) and cumulatively
occupy the third largest amount of sequence compared to the
other tandem repeats (Table 3). The repeat motif AC is the
most frequent (26%), which is slightly less than in tetraodon
and stickleback (30% each), and considerably more than in
medaka (10%) and zebrafish (15%; Additional data file 5).
Minisatellites are far more abundant in N. furzeri than in the
other four fish species. In particular, a 77-nucleotide minisatellite is most frequent. It comprises approximately 10% of the
5.4 Mb (Table 3) and its consensus sequence has a G+C content (63.6%) well above the genome average. Sequence conservation is high, for example, in an alignment of 189 repeat
monomers; 65 of 77 positions (84%) are identical in at least
90% of monomers (Figure 4). Using in situ hybridization we
found that this minisatellite localizes to centromeric regions
of many chromosomes (Figure 5a). Also, the 77-nucleotide
minisatellite is N. furzeri specific as we did not detect this or
similar tandem repeats in available genomic sequences of
other fishes and vertebrates. We identified several other
abundant and G+C-rich minisatellites (Table 3), which also
localize to centromeric regions. For example, a 49-nucleotide
minisatellite is also found in centromeric regions of many
chromosomes, whereas a 24-nucleotide minisatellite specifically localizes to centromeres of only two chromosomes (Fig-

assess chromosome specificity and derive chromosome-specific probes.
Hundreds of repetitions of the minisatellite motif 5'TTAGGG-3' are found at telomeric ends of vertebrate chromosomes [39] and with associated proteins keep telomeres in
homeostasis [40]. The telomeric repeat is not contained in
the 5.4 Mb of N. furzeri. Most likely this is due to the limited
sample size and so we searched for the repeat motif in the
111.6 Mb sample. We found 50 sequences, 14 of which are
entirely composed of [TTAGGG]n. Correspondingly, in FISH
experiments using the 5'-TTAGGG-3' motif as probe, specifically the terminal ends of chromosomes were labeled (I
Nanda, unpublished results). Thus, characteristic vertebrate
telomeric structures are present in N. furzeri and will be
described elsewhere [15].
In addition to the G+C-rich minisatellites reported above,
there is a prominent satellite repeat in N. furzeri. It comprises
approximately 6% of our genomic sequence samples and has
a monomer length of 348 nucleotides (Table 3). The G+C content of its consensus sequence (41.1%) is below the genome
average. This satellite accounts for a second anomaly in the
G+C distribution of N. furzeri; it causes an excess of
sequences at approximately 41% G+C (Figure 3a). We found
that this repeat also localizes to centromeric regions of many
chromosomes (Figure 5d). It is currently not clear if higher
order repeat structures are formed by the two types of tandem
repeats and if these are specific to certain chromosomes, or if
and how this impacts on the structural organization of the N.
furzeri genome [41,42]. A direct influence on N. furzeri life
span seems unlikely, since the tandem repeat content of the
GRZ and MZM-0403 strains is identical while their life spans
differ by a factor of two. It is tempting, however, to speculate
that these tandem repeats play a role in cell division, and that
both the exceptional size and composition of N. furzeri centromeres might be functionally linked to the extremely fast
growth of young fish. In mammals, repetitive DNA becomes
demethylated over age, which might affect chromosome
structure in constitutive heterochromatin composed of such
repeats. Since DNA methylation is also observed in fishes [4346], it will be interesting to analyze whether methylation
occurs in the G+C-rich tandem repeats of N. furzeri and
whether methylation changes with age, or differs between
strains exhibiting different life spans.
In summary, tandem repeats, comprising a total of 20.6% of
the genome, are exceptionally abundant in N. furzeri. They
are 4-12 times more frequent than in zebrafish (5.0%), tetraodon (3.6%), stickleback (2.1%) and medaka (1.7%; Table 2). In
tetraodon, two major satellites are reported [31]. One is a subtelocentric, highly variable ten-nucleotide minisatellite,
which is also the most prominent tandem repeat in this fish,
while the other is a centromeric, somewhat variable 118nucleotide satellite also found in Takifugu rubripes.

Reichwald et al. R16.10

Interspersed transposon-derived repeats are mobile genetic
elements and common to many eukaryotic genomes. Using
RepeatMasker and Repbase Update, the reference library of
vertebrate repeats [47], we found that 7-9% of the N. furzeri
5.4 Mb samples is composed of known interspersed repeats
(Table 2). Of these, approximately 6.3% are retrotransposons
and approximately 1.5% DNA transposons. To identify novel
transposon-derived repeats, we used the ab initio repeat
identification program RepeatScout [48], which was recently
found to be suitable for analyzing short sequences, although
originally developed to analyze longer sequences [49].
Accordingly, 16-18% of our N. furzeri genomic samples are
composed of novel interspersed repeats. Unfortunately, a
detailed classification of the novel repeats is currently not feasible, again due to the limited/fragmented sample size. However, we assume that the fraction of these repeats identified in
the 5.4 Mb closely resembles the overall fraction present in
the N. furzeri genome, because our estimate for the medaka
genomic sample corresponds well with the estimate given for
the medaka draft genome [20]. In total, interspersed repeats
comprise 24.7% of the N. furzeri genome, which isconsiderably more than in tetraodon (3.4%), stickleback (4.5%), and
medaka (13.6%), and less than in zebrafish (35.4%). The overall repeat content in N. furzeri thus amounts to approximately 45%, which is the highest among the analyzed fish
species. We note that this value might still be an underestimate, as we can not exclude that the interspersed repeat content might be found to be higher upon analysis of larger
genomic samples since it is conceivable that we have missed
'rare' repeats in our samples.

Protein coding sequences
We attempted to explore the protein coding fraction contained in the 5.4 Mb of N. furzeri GRZ genomic sequence with
respect to conservation in medaka, stickleback, tetraodon,
zebrafish and human. As indicated above, we found that 444
of the N. furzeri GRZ sequences (473 kb of the 5.4 Mb) bear
fragments of protein coding genes (Additional data file 2).
Roughly one-third (152 kb) of the sequences are actually coding, and most of these (399, 94.3%) contain one to three
exons. The G+C content of the 444 sequences (44.1%) fits the
genome average and is considerably higher (50.3%) in the
coding portions. Similar observations were made in tetraodon and medaka [19,20].
Of the 444 sequences, 310 (70%) show best matches to fishes,
while 32 (7%) and 23 (5%) match best to human and mouse,
respectively (Additional data file 2). Furthermore, 410 (92%)
of the 444 N. furzeri gene fragments have homologs in at least
one of the other four fish species with amino acid identities of
22-100%. For a subset of 180 (40%) N. furzeri gene fragments
we identified homologs in all four fish species. In those,
amino acid conservation is highest in medaka (77.4%) and
stickleback (77.1%) followed by tetraodon (75.2%) and
zebrafish (70.1%). Lastly, of the 34 (8%) N. furzeri gene fragments without a counterpart in currently available sequences

of the four fish species, four match best to other fish species
(58-100% amino acid identity), 13 to mammalian/vertebrate
proteins (26-67% amino acid identity), and 17 to plant, fungal, invertebrate and other proteins (27-72% amino acid identity) (Additional data file 6).

late about the reasons for this difference. One possibility
might be that it reflects a bias introduced by the sampling
procedure of the 444 gene fragments. On the other hand, the
difference might be related to the huge difference in life span
between N. furzeri and human.

In a complementary approach, we cloned complete coding
sequences of five N. furzeri genes, Cdkn2b, Cdkn2d, Msra,
Sirt1 and Tp53. Their gene products are involved in different
aspects of aging and functionally conserved across taxa
[1,50,51]. Sirtuin1 is a NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase considered to mediate the life span extending effects of
calorie restriction [52], and its aging regulating function is
conserved from yeast to mammals. Msra repairs and protects
proteins from oxidation [53], and mice with mutations in it
show a reduced life span [54]. Cdkn2b, Cdkn2d and Tp53
control cell cycle progression and mediate senescence [5557]. A comparison of respective N. furzeri and human proteins should give an indication as to the potential use of this
fish as a model for human biology. The five N. furzeri proteins
are 40-65% conserved in humans (Table 4), which is in the
range reported for orthologous proteins of teleost fishes and
humans (60-70%) [19]. For comparison with zebrafish, which
is perhaps the best established fish model for human biomedical phenotypes [58], we deduced zebrafish Cdkn2b, Cdkn2d,
Msra, Sirt1 and Tp53 genes based on database searches and
alignments of expressed sequence tags to genomic DNA
(Additional data file 7). Conservation of inferred zebrafish
proteins to human orthologs is in the same range (41-65%) as
for N. furzeri and humans (Cdkn2b, 41%; Msra, 65.3%; Sirt1,
48.9%; Tp53, 48%). Conservation of the five N. furzeri aging
relevant genes with respect to the other four fish species is
highest in medaka, followed by stickleback, tetraodon and
zebrafish (Table 4), the same as for the 180 random gene fragments described above.

Phylogeny
In an initial attempt at phylogenetic reconstruction, we used
the N. furzeri 28S rRNA gene (Additional data file 8) in comparison with 15 fish and two tetrapod sequences. However,
standard parsimony analysis resulted in tree topologies much
different from widely accepted taxonomic groupings (data
not shown), indicating that the phylogenetic information contained in the 28S rRNA locus does not resolve the evolutionary history of fishes and tetrapods. We thus attempted to infer
the phylogenetic positioning of N. furzeri with respect to the
four fish model species and humans based on the 444 partial
protein coding sequences and aging related genes identified
in this work. A phylogenetic tree obtained by the maximum
parsimony approach (Figure 6) is fully consistent with the
taxonomic classification of the analyzed fish species. Accordingly, Nothobranchius is most closely related to medaka.
Zebrafish and humans are both distantly related to the euteleost fish division consisting of the Atherinomorpha Nothobranchius and medaka on the one hand, and the
Percomorpha stickleback and tetraodon on the other. The
same tree topology was obtained using the neighbor-joining
method, giving slightly lower bootstrap confidence (data not
shown). We conclude that the coding fragments are sufficient
to create a stable phylogeny, as previously suggested [59].
Our data are in agreement with phylogenetic analyses performed for ten fish species, which, based on expressed
sequence tag analyses, found both killifish and medaka to be
more distant from pufferfish than from each other [59].

Genetic variability
Finally, we attempted to relate the 444 gene fragments and 5
aging related genes with respect to conservation in humans.
We analyzed exons encompassing at least 33 amino acids,
which number 366 in the former data set and 21 in the latter.
In these exons, conservation with human counterparts is considerably higher for random gene fragments than for aging
related genes: 67% versus 62%. Currently, we can only specu-

The N. furzeri GRZ strain studied in this work most probably
originates from a single pair, which stems from wild fish captured in 1968, and was used for breeding more than 30 years
ago [11]. If we assume a generation time of 6 months - comprising 12-16 weeks following hatching and about the same
time for embryonic development - GRZ fish would have been
inbred for approximately 80 generations until today. Thus, it

Evolutionary relationships of N. furzeri to medaka, stickleback, tetraodon, zebrafish and human

Evolutionary relationships of N. furzeri to medaka, stickleback, tetraodon, zebrafish and human. The evolutionary history based on the maximum parsimony

was generally assumed that GRZ fish are highly homogeneous
[17], although experimental proof was lacking.
To assess the genetic variability of the GRZ strain, we genotyped eight microsatellites (four di-, three tri- and one tetranucleotide repeat, identified in the 5.4 Mb), in 20 GRZ
specimens. All microsatellites are monomorphic; we
observed only one allele in the 20 specimens, respectively
(Additional data file 9). To extend the analysis to gene associated markers, we resequenced parts of 19 protein coding
genes encompassing 4 exonic and 15 intronic regions (10.2 kb
in total). Again, there was no sequence variation in the 20
GRZ fish. In a third approach, we performed multi-locus fingerprinting in ten GRZ specimens using the 5'-GGAT-3'
repeat as a marker [60]. As for the other markers, all specimens were homozygous at all 5'-GGAT-3' marker loci. Thus,
we provide here the first experimental confirmation that the
GRZ strain is highly inbred. In contrast, N. furzeri strain
MZM-0403, bred in the sixth captive generation in our facility, exhibits 2-6 alleles in the microsatellites and has single
nucleotide variations in 14 of the 19 genes. Also, a laboratory
strain of the closely related species N. kunthae is highly heterogeneous in all markers that could be analyzed (Additional
data files 9 and 10). While the inbreeding status of the GRZ
strain is advantageous for further genetic analyses, it is currently unclear to what extent its short life span results from
inbreeding depression [61]. A reduction of fitness can be
caused by the accumulation of deleterious alleles [62], and

reduced genetic diversity often affects birth weight, survival,
reproduction and resistance to disease [63]. In this respect is
noteworthy that the N. furzeri GRZ strain is derived from one
'normal' breeding pair that, 35 years ago, lived "a good 4 and
a half months" (16-18 weeks), and that "healthy young fish"
were used for spawning [11]. In our facility, the 10% survivorship (that is, the maximum life span) of direct descendants of
these fish is 16 weeks and the fish can live up to 21 weeks [15],
which is well in the range reported for the founders. Furthermore, there are differences in age-related histological damage
between GRZ and age matched MZM-0403, which argue for
accelerated aging in the GRZ strain rather than inbreedingrelated early death. For example, measurement of lipofuscin,
which is an autofluorescing pigment that accumulates over
age in a number of species [64], shows accelerated aging in
brain and liver of the GRZ strain compared to age matched
MZM-0403 [18]. To assess the degree of inbreeding depression on the life span of N. furzeri GRZ, access to new N.
furzeri wild isolates from the GRZ game reserve in Zimbabwe
or a nearby location is highly desirable. These fish could be
cross-bred with the inbred GRZ strain and traits related to fitness, such as growth rate, reproduction, and survival, could
be recorded and compared to the parental GRZ strain/wild
isolate. On the other hand, it has to be noted that inbred lines
are extremely powerful tools for biomedical research; if not
subjected to severe inbreeding depression, they are valuable
in many respects as they provide a uniform and stable genetic
background and respective phenotype(s). Our results prove

Genome Biology 2009, 10:R16

http://genomebiology.com/content/10/2/R16

the feasibility of establishing N. furzeri inbred lines, which in
the future may become instrumental in dissecting complex
traits like life span.

Conclusion

Our analyses provide a first glimpse into the genome of the
short-lived annual fish N. furzeri, which we would like to support as a new vertebrate model for age research, as has been
suggested previously [9,12,17].
At an estimated 1.6-1.9 Gb, N. furzeri has the largest genome
compared with medaka, stickleback, tetraodon and zebrafish,
which serve as models in many areas of contemporary
research and for which genome projects have been completed
or are underway. At the cytological level, a compartmentalization of the N. furzeri genome is apparent, which is caused by
an accumulation of G+C-rich heterochromatin in centromeric regions of most chromosomes. This is mirrored in the
composition of N. furzeri repeats, which among the analyzed
fishes occupy the largest genomic fraction and are distinguished by an unmatched portion of G+C-rich and -poor tandem repeats. The most abundant G+C-rich species-specific
minisatellites localize to centromeric regions and cause an
unusual second peak in the G+C content distribution of the N.
furzeri genome. The exceptionally high tandem repeat and
G+C content is neither an inbreeding artifact of the GRZ
strain nor can it be directly linked to life span, since genome
structure and repeat content do not differ between the N.
furzeri GRZ and MZM-0403 strains, although the former is
highly inbred and the latter is a recently wild-derived strain
and they differ in life span by a factor of two. The high tandem
repeat and G+C content rather represent an N. furzeri-specific feature since this is much less pronounced in the closely
related species N. kunthae, and has so far not been observed
in vertebrates.
The N. furzeri and N. kunthae genomic sequences are a
source of markers that can be used to build a first generation
linkage map as well as to assess the genetic variability of Nothobranchius laboratory strains and natural populations with
different life spans. An initial marker set provided the first
molecular confirmation that the N. furzeri strain GRZ is
highly inbred in contrast to the recently wild-derived strain
MZM-0403 as well as the N. kunthae laboratory strain, which
were found to be very heterogeneous.
Cross-breeding of N. furzeri strains with different life spans is
currently being performed in our laboratory and should enable the identification of quantitative trait loci and facilitate
cloning of aging-relevant genetic determinants. The present
study illustrates the challenges that will have to be addressed
in an N. furzeri genome project that we would like to establish
in order to make maximal use of this fish species as a vertebrate model for aging research.

Materials and methods
Specimens
For genomic sequencing, N. furzeri GRZ obtained in 2002
from Marc Bellemans (Hove, Belgium) were used. Karyotyping and chromosome stainings were done using: two male
and female N. furzeri GRZ specimens obtained from Werner
Krammer (Deutsche Killifisch Gesellschaft, Ausgburg, Germany); one male N. orthonotus from Nisa (Mozambique) collected by MaS and SS in 2006; one male N. hengstleri
collected in 2005 in Mozambique from location MZHL-200514; and one male N. eggersi collected in 1997 in Tanzania
from location TZ 97/55. Fish were kept in 40 liter tanks at
26°C and room temperature with sponge filters driven by an
air supply. Water changes were performed every other day.

Chromosome preparations and banding analyses
To obtain mitotic chromosomes, healthy fish were exposed to
a 0.03% colchicine solution for 8-12 h in a well ventilated container. Then fish were sedated on ice, killed by caput dislocation, and gills, spleen and kidney carefully removed.
Preparation of cell suspension, hypotonic treatment, fixation
of cells, and preparation of slides were as described [65]. Conventional chromosome staining, fluorescence staining with
DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and mithramycin
were as described [66]. To enhance the mithramycin fluorescence, slides were first pre-incubated with distamycin A. The
location of constitutive heterochromatin on chromosomes
was visualized as reported [67].

Flow cytometry measurements
Fin clips were taken from three N. furzeri GRZ females and at
least 10,000 cells per sample measured on a Cell Analyzer
CAII (Partec, Muenster, Germany). As reference, similar
numbers of erythrocytes of a female chicken were used. Preparation of cell suspensions, fixation, DAPI staining and measurements were as described [28]. PI staining was performed
at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml for 30 minutes at 37°C as
described [60]. For each dye, three independent measurements were performed.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization
FISH mapping of repetitive DNA on N. furzeri GRZ chromosomes was performed as described [68]. Briefly, a biotin
labeled plasmid clone bearing a specific tandem repeat was
denatured and hybridized overnight at 37°C to denatured
metaphase chromosomes. After post-hybridization washes at
low (2× SSC, 50°C) and moderately (1× SSC, 60°C) stringent
conditions, hybridization sites were detected with fuorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated avidin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) followed by signal amplification
through incubation of slides with biotinylated anti-avidin and
FITC conjugated avidin. Slides were examined on a microscope with a CCD camera (Zeiss, Goettingen, Germany);
chromosomes showing specific FITC signals were displayed
on counter-stained DAPI metaphases using appropriate software (Applied Spectral Imaging, Neckarhausen, Germany).

DNA/RNA

Marker generation and experimental validation

For genomic library construction, DNA of one male specimen
of each of N. furzeri GRZ, N. furzeri MZM-0403, and N.
kunthae, was isolated from 30 mg frozen tissue with the
Blood and Cell Culture DNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For marker validation, genomic DNA from 20 N.
furzeri GRZ, 10 MZM-0403 and 10 N. kunthae specimens
was isolated using 30 mg frozen tissue and AquaGenomicSolution (MobiTec, Goettingen, Germany), respectively. For
GRZ, 50 ng DNA from ten specimens each were combined in
a pool. For cloning of known aging related genes, RNA was
isolated from one N. furzeri GRZ male using the RNeasy Mini
kit (Qiagen). Primer sequences are given in Additional data
file 11.

Microsatellites were identified in the 5.4 Mb of N. furzeri GRZ
using Sputnik (see Repeat identification). Flanking primers
were designed in sequences with: one microsatellite; at least
20 repeat units for dinucleotide repeats, or at least 10 repeat
units for tri- and tetranucleotide repeats; at least 100 nucleotides of flanking sequence; perfect repeats. PCR was performed in two pools of GRZ DNA (see DNA/RNA) with one
primer being 6-FAM-labeled. For genotyping, ABI 3730xl
sequencers and GeneMapper software Version 4 was used.
Allele calling was performed independently by two individuals. Discrepancies were resolved by retyping. For resequencing of gene-associated markers, primers were designed in 19
sequences with significant homology to known genes in at
least one of the four fish reference genomes. PCR and
sequencing was performed in two DNA pools of GRZ, and ten
individual N. kunthae fish as described above.

Sequencing
For shotgun sequencing using Sanger technology, randomly
sheared, end-repaired 1-3 kb DNA fragments were ligated
into pUC18. Recombinant plasmids were amplified in E. coli,
purified, sequenced from both ends (BigDye Terminator v.1.1
Cycle Sequencing Kit, ABI, Weiterstadt, Germany) and separated on ABI 3730xl capillary sequencers. After quality clipping, sequences were assembled based on overlaps and read
pair information [69]. Contaminations were identified by
BLASTN searches in GenBank sections bacteria, protozoa
and phage (version 161, 15.08.2007 [70]) and removed. Then,
a database comprising all sequences was built and each
sequence searched against the database using WU-BLASTN.
A sequence was regarded redundant if: in addition to the best
hit against itself another hit was found (p ≤ 10-30, ≥95% identitiy); and no other matches were found. Redundant
sequences were excluded. Remaining data comprise 5,540
contigs and 5.36 Mb for N. furzeri GRZ, 5,686 contigs and
5.39 Mb for N. furzeri MZM-0403, 6,273 contigs and 5.36 Mb
for N. kunthae (Table 1). Contigs are referred to as sequences
in the text. All Sanger sequences were submitted to the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Also,
a database was created and is available for BLAST searches at
[71]. For genomic sequencing using Roche/454 Life Sciences
GS20 technology, 5 μg of N. furzeri GRZ genomic DNA were
used and 111.6 Mb sequenced (Table 1). These sequences were
not assembled prior to analyses and submitted to the trace
archive at NCBI.

PCR
Primers were designed using the GAP4 module of the Staden
Sequence Analysis Package [72] and ordered from Metabion
(Martinsried, Germany). For PCR, 50 ng DNA, 10 pmol of
each primer and PuReTaq Ready-To-Go PCR beads (GE
Healthcare, Munich, Germany) were used; initial denaturation was at 94°C for 30 s followed by 35 cycles of 60 s at 94°C,
60 s at primer annealing temperature, 60 s extension at 72°C,
and a final extension at 72°C for 300 s. PCR products were
sequenced as described above. Sequences were visualized,
edited and assembled in GAP4.

Reference data sets
In order to compare our genomic data of N. furzeri strains
GRZ and MZM-0403, and N. kunthae, which we obtained by
random genome-wide sample sequencing, we simulated this
approach in silico for the other four fish species. That is, we
extracted random genomic data from the publicly available
genome assemblies for each. In detail, these were 20 samples
of random genomic sequence sets of medaka, stickleback,
tetraodon and zebrafish from genome assemblies at Ensembl
[21] (Tetraodon nigroviridis update release (2007-05-29),
Gasterosteus aculeatus update release (2007-05-30),
Oryzias latipes update release (2007-05-24), Danio rerio
update release (2007-07-30)). For ten samples, each reference data set represented 0.4% of the respective genome and
had a sequence length distribution corresponding to the 5.4
Mb of N. furzeri generated by Sanger sequencing. For the
other ten samples, sequence sets comprised 6% of the respective genome with a length distribution corresponding to the
111.6 Mb of N. furzeri GRZ sequenced by 454/GS20 technology. For genome size estimation, random genomic sequences
of medaka, stickleback, tetraodon, and zebrafish were
extracted in the same way; each comprised 5.4 Mb and had a
sequence length distribution similar to the N. furzeri 5.4 Mb.

BLAST analyses
To determine the coding fraction, a BLASTX search in SwissProt/TrEMBL (version 50.6) was performed. Hits with p <
10-10 were regarded significant. Reference data sets of the four
fish species were analyzed in the same way. Then, N. furzeri
GRZ and MZM-0403 sequences containing coding portions
were used for TBLASTX searches in medaka, stickleback,
tetraodon and zebrafish cDNA collections downloaded from
Ensembl [21] (see 'Reference data sets' above for release
dates). A p-value < 10-10 was set as the threshold for significance.

Repeat identification
First, tandem repeats were identified and masked (replaced
by Ns) using Tandem Repeats Finder, version 4.00 [73] with
the following parameters: Match 2, Mismatch 7, Delta 7, PM
80, PI 10, Minscore 50, MaxPeriod 1,300 (half the length of
the longest sequence in the N. furzeri 5.4 Mb). Second, known
interspersed repeats - that is, sequences matching entries
from Repbase Update [47] - were identified and masked using
RepeatMasker (version open-3.1.8; AFA Smit, R Hubley and
P Green, unpublished data) [74], with standard parameters.
Third, for de novo repeat identification, RepeatScout, version
1.0.2 [48] with standard parameters, except for a minimum
repeat copy number of 3, was used on the pre-masked
sequences. Finally, a species specific repeat consensus library
was built using both the identified known repeat families and
the previously unknown repeat consensus sequences.
To detect microsatellites (1-5 nucleotides) the program Sputnik [38] with parameters -v 1 -u 5 was used.

Phylogenetic analyses
Of the 444 gene fragments of N. furzeri GRZ, we first identified 44 for which we could unambiguously assign human
orthologs based on BLASTX searches in Swiss-Prot. Based on
these assignments, we searched for orthologous regions in
medaka, stickleback, tetraodon, and zebrafish genome
assemblies at University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) [75]
(oryLat1, tetNig1, gasAcu1, danRer5, hg18) by inspection of
MAF tracks. We extracted exons, which we regarded as true
orthologs if: no duplicated gene was detected in the respective
species; splice sites were conserved; and no frameshifts were
detected if consecutive exons were concatenated. In total, this
resulted in 71 orthologous exons, identified in all six species
(average length is 142 bp for human exons), which represent
fragments of 26 protein coding genes (sequences are listed in
Additional data file 12, including exons of N. furzeri GRZ).
Five of the gene fragments represent one exon, while the others span at least one splice site. For further analyses,
sequences were concatenated, translated, aligned by ClustalW v1.81 with standard parameters [76] and trimmed at the
ends if necessary. Coding sequences of the aging related genes
Msra, Sirt1, and Tp53 were also translated and aligned. All
alignments were concatenated, resulting in 4,828 amino acid
positions, and analyzed by MEGA4 [77] with different methods (alignment available on request). Positions containing
gaps and missing data were eliminated, leaving a total of
4,245 positions in the final dataset, of which 508 were parsimony informative. A maximum parsimony tree was obtained
using the Close-Neighbor-Interchange algorithm in which the
initial trees were obtained with the random addition of
sequences (100 replicates).

Sequence comparison
Nucleotide sequences of putative orthologs of the four analyzed fish species were identified as described above and are
listed in Additional data file 7. Nucleotide and translated
