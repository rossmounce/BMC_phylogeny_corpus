Abstract
Background: The prolactin-related proteins (PRPs) are non-classical placental-specific members
of the prolactin/growth hormone family. Among ruminants, they are expressed in the cotyledonary
villi of cattle and goat. We investigated placental PRP in sheep in order to gain a comprehensive
understanding of the function and evolution of these molecules. We also examined the sequence
properties, expression and lactogenic activation of the cloned genes.
Results: We cloned two novel ovine PRPs, named oPRP1 and oPRP2. oPRP2 had a typical PRP
sequence similar to bovine PRP1 (bPRP1). oPRP1 had a short sequence identical with bovine or
caprine type PRP but the reading frame was shifted. Both oPRPs were expressed in trophoblast giant
binucleate cells (BNC) as in cattle and goat. oPRP1 expression declined from the early to the middle
stage of gestation. In contrast, oPRP2 expression remained constant throughout the gestation
period. oPRP2 was translated to form a mature protein in a mammalian cell expression system.
Western blotting showed a molecular mass of 35 kDa for the FLAG-tag fusion oPRP2 protein. This
recombinant protein and bPRP1 were bioassayed using Nb2 lymphoma cells; it was confirmed that
neither ruminant PRP had lactogenic activity because the Nb2 lymphoma cells did not proliferate.
Conclusion: We have identified two novel PRPs, oPRP1 and oPRP2, in ovine placenta. Both these
ovine PRPs were localized and quantitatively expressed in BNC. Absence of lactogenic activity was
confirmed for the oPRP2 molecule. It is anticipated that novel and known ruminant PRPs have
common functions, except for lactogenic activity.

Background
Prolactin-related proteins (PRPs) are non-classical members of the prolactin (PRL)/growth hormone (GH) family
that have been found in bovine, caprine, murine and rat
placenta. In cattle, placental lactogen (PL) and thirteen
types of placental PRPs have so far been reported [1-3]. In

goats, PL has been detected in the placenta [4], and two
newly-discovered PRPs were reported as PRL-related molecules in our recent study [5]. In ruminants, specifically in
cattle, sheep and goats, trophoblast-specific genes such as
PL [4,6,7], pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAGs) [811], interferon-tau (IFNT) [12-14], trophoblast kunitz

domain proteins (TKDPs) [15,16] and cathepsins (CTSs)
[17,18] are known to be key factors for implantation and
placentation, and are expressed in trophoblast cells
including trophoblast giant binucleate cells (BNC). However, no molecules similar in sequence to bovine and/or
caprine PRPs have been reported in sheep. It is assumed
that PRP orthologs are involved in ovine placenta because
placental PRL-like molecules have been discovered in
many mammals, not only in cattle and goat but also in
mouse and rat [1-3,19]. In the present study, we identified
the mRNAs of two novel PRPs in ovine placenta and
investigated their expression in the ovine placentome. We
named them ovine prolactin-related protein-1 (oPRP1)
and prolactin-related protein-2 (oPRP2) on the basis of
similarities with cattle and goat sequences. They were
translated in a HEK293 cell transfection system, as in the
case of cattle [20,21]. Their lactogenic activities were confirmed by an Nb2 lymphoma cell bioassay [22-24]. An
aim of future research will be to determine the function of
ruminant PRP molecules that appear in the placenta. A
crucial part of such a study will be to express ruminant
PRP in other species. The purposes of the present study are
(i) to explore a bPRP homolog gene in ovine placenta, (ii)
to investigate the localized and quantitative expression of
oPRP and (iii) to examine the possible biological activity
of oPRP, because comparison among ruminant PRP structures and/or expression may provide clues to understanding PRP function.

Results
oPRP1 and oPRP2 nucleotide sequences and deduced
amino acid sequences
Full-length oPRP1 and oPRP2 were cloned from the ovine
placentome on day 95 of gestation. oPRP1 was 893
nucleotides (nts) long with a 540-nts protein coding
sequence region (CDS); oPRP2 had a 947-nts full-length
sequence and a 717-nts CDS. The protein sequences
deduced from the full-length cDNAs comprised 179
amino acids (aa) in oPRP1 and 238 aa in oPRP2. The
sequence region in which oPRP1 mRNA is defective compared to other PRP mRNAs is shown in Fig. 1 along with
the sequences of oPRP2, cPRP1 and bPRP1. oPRP1 has a
shorter sequence, lacking 52 bp from the CDS regions of
other PRP sequences (positions 529–580). Since the reading frame of the codon is shifted at the 52 bp defect, the
CDS region became 540 bp.

Fig. 2 shows a phylogenetic tree analysis based on the predicted aa sequences of the new oPRPs and other prolactin
family members in cattle and goat. We confirmed a close
phylogenetic relationship between oPRP1 and bPRP1,
bPRP2, bPRP4, bPRP9, bPRP12, bPRP14 and cPRP1,
which have known sequences. oPRP2 was considerably
more distant from bPRP1, bPRP2, bPRP4, bPRP9,

bPRP12, bPRP14 and cPRP1 in the phylogenetic tree analysis.
The identity of oPRP1 and oPRP2 with the phylogenetically neighbouring PRPs is demonstrated in Fig. 3 and
Table 1. The N-terminal regions of the oPRP1 and oPRP2
proteins are rich in hydrophobic amino acid residues,
which is characteristic of signal peptides. The signal peptide sequence, which is composed of 36 amino acids, is
well conserved in the bPRP and/or cPRP family [1,5]. The
mature oPRP1 protein is predicted to have one disulfide
bond with three cysteines (Cys). In contrast, the mature
oPRP2 protein is predicted to have three disulfide bonds
with six Cys. Normally, Cys is common to the 39, 42, 97,
215, 232 and 238 positions in bPRP1, bPRP2, bPRP4,
bPRP9, bPRP12, bPRP14 and cPRP1 (Fig. 3). In contrast,
oPRP1 lacked the Cys at positions 215, 232 and 238,
because there is no sequence corresponding to positions
180–238 (Fig. 3). oPRP1 has one potential consensus
sequence for typical N-glycosylation, an Asn-X-Ser/Thr
(NXS or NXT) at positions 70–72 (Fig. 3). oPRP2 has two
consensus sequences for N-glycosylation at positions 92–
94 and 146–148 (Fig. 3). Another atypical N-glycosylation site, Asn-X-Cys (NXC), was exhibited at positions 95–
97 in oPRP1 (Fig. 3). The two positions in oPRP2 coincided with those in bPRP2, bPRP4, bPRP9 and bPRP14
(Fig. 3) [1,20,21]. In contrast, the typical position (70–
72) in oPRP1 coincided with those in bPRP1 and cPRP1,

intense oPRP1 expression in ICOT than in PTM during the
early (Day 45) to middle (Day 95) stages of gestation. In
contrast, oPRP2 expression was greater in the PTM than
ICOT throughout pregnancy.
Production of recombinant proteins
We produced oPRP2 recombinant protein in order to
investigate its lactogenic activity. Cloned oPRP2 sequences
were efficiently translated in an HEK293 cell system, as in
the case of bovine PRPs (Fig. 8) [20,21]. A FLAG-tag
fusion oPRP2 protein was translated at approximately 35
kDa (Fig. 8). We also tried to produce recombinant oPRP1

protein in a mammalian cell system but were unable to do
so.
Lactogenic activity of PRP
Ovine PRL (positive control) stimulated Nb2 lymphoma
cell proliferation effectively, and another lactogenic protein, bovine PL, showed stimulatory activity (Fig 9). No
stimulatory activity was detected in recombinant oPRP2,
as for bPRP1.

mation about these proteins is limited except for PRL, PL
and some rodent prolactin-like proteins (Prlps) [2,19,2529]. In particular, ruminants commonly have various
genes of this family, but there is no information regarding
sheep, even though anatomical evidence shows that placentae are similar among bovidae [1,20,21,30,31]. Thirteen varieties of PRP paralogs have been reported in
bovines and two in goat [1,5,20,21]. In the present study,
we have identified novel PRPs in sheep and compared the
properties of sheep and cattle/goat.
The novel oPRP1 and oPRP2 genes were detected in and
cloned from ovine placenta and oPRP1 was deduced to
have a shortened amino acid sequence. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that PRP molecules evolved as ruminant species diverged, because these ovine PRPs are
phylogenetically adjacent to caprine and bovine PRPs
(Fig. 2).
We confirmed the short variant form of PRP in ovine placenta (Figs. 3 and 4). Although there is no report that
short variant forms result from alternative splicing or proteolytic cleavage in non-classical members of the PRL family, namely bovine PRP, caprine PRP, mouse Prlp and rat
Prlp [1,2,5,25,26], short variants of bPL and PRL have
been reported [32,33]. Two types of short bPL variant are
formed by alternative splicing [34]. One has a premature
stop codon because of a shift in the reading frame.
Although the defective position in the bPL variant
sequence was similar to that in oPRP1, bPL lacked only 23
bp in this region. It is not yet known whether the short
bPL variant exists or what function it may have. Some

structural variants of PRL proteins have been confirmed in
various mammalian species [32]. A short fragment of PRL
protein has also been confirmed in rat, mouse and human
[35-37]. Although these short PRL (16 kDa-PRL) molecules may result from alternative splicing, they could also
be generated by proteolytic cleavage. The cleavage site
(positions 145–149 in the mature region) almost coincides with the position of the oPRP1 stop codon. These
short PRLs in mouse and human are known to have
potential as inhibitors of capillary endothelial cell proliferation [38,39]. The short PRL in rat produces an anti-angiogenic effect via an unique, high-affinity, saturable
receptor that is different from the PRL receptor [40].
Whether oPRP1 corresponds to the short PRL receptor is
not certain, because full-length PRL binds to the PRL
receptor and some ruminant PRPs do not. However, one
hypothesis may be that oPRP1 has an inhibitory effect on
the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells, because the
sequence length and the mature protein region are similar
to those of the short PRL variants in human and rodents.
Members of the rodent Prl superfamily, namely prolactinlike proteins (Prlp), proliferins (Plf) and proliferin-related
protein (Plfr), are non-classical and have several specific
activities such as angiogenesis [41-43], hematopoiesis
[44-46] and immunomodulation [47-50]. A possible
hypothetical function for oPRP1 may be in the regulation
of angiogenesis, but its actual function remains to be clarified.
Primary expression of oPRP1 and oPRP2 mRNA was
observed in BNC (Fig. 6). The localization of oPRP

mRNAs is similar to that of PRP family members in other
ruminants [5,20,21,30,31,51]. The mRNAs of both oPRPs
were detected in the PTM and ICOT tissues throughout
pregnancy (Fig. 7). However, the expression patterns were
different; oPRP1 expression declined with the progress of
the pregnancy in PTM and ICOT, but in contrast, oPRP2
expression remained constant throughout pregnancy.
However, there seems to be a discrepancy between the
localization and quantitative expression of oPRP2: quantitative real-time RT-PCR (QPCR) data suggest that oPRP2
may be expressed not only in BNC but also in conventional trophoblast cells, as in bovine [20,21]. In bPRP
expression profiles, four types of expression pattern were
found during pregnancy in PTM: (i) genes expressed
around the window; (ii) genes with peak expression
around mid-gestation; (iii) genes that show increasing
expression during the progression of gestation and peak
late in gestation; (iv) genes with approximately constant
expression throughout gestation [34]. In the present
study, although expression was not determined during the
implantation period, oPRP1 expression may correspond
to the type (ii) pattern. In contrast, oPRP2 expression
might be type (iv) but without lactogenic activity. The
functional significance of short PRPs and various other
kinds of PRP in ruminant placenta is still unclear. We
could produce recombinant oPRP2 protein as well as proteins of other ruminant species (cattle and goat)
[5,20,21]. Only the absence of lactogenic activity is clearly
confirmed for recombinant oPRP2 and bPRP1 by a bioassay using Nb2 lymphoma cells.

Conclusion
We have cloned two novel prolactin-related protein genes
in ovine placentome. The ovine PRP sequences have a
high homology with bovine PRP. However, oPRP1 has a
premature stop codon, which has not been discovered in
bovine and caprine PRPs. oPRPs were expressed in trophoblast BNC, as are bovine or caprine PRPs. Their
mRNAs were expressed throughout gestation. oPRP1
mRNA declined with the progress of gestation; oPRP2
mRNA remained constant throughout. oPRP2 produced
mature recombinant protein in a mammalian cell-expression system. We confirmed that oPRP2 is lactogenically
inactive, as oPRP2 treatment did not induce proliferation
of Nb2 lymphoma cells.

Methods
Animals and tissues collection
Ovine placental tissues for cDNA cloning, mRNA expression and in situ hybridization were collected from Corriedale sheep. The PTM and ICOT were collected at a local
slaughterhouse on Days 45 (n = 3 animals), 95 (n = 3 animals) and 135 (n = 2 animals) of gestation after natural
mating (day 1). The collected samples were stored at 80°C prior to RNA extraction. The placentomes were fixed

in 3.7% formaldehyde PBS at pH 7.4 and then embedded
in paraffin wax and stored at 4°C prior to in situ hybridization.
All procedures for these animal experiments were carried
out in accordance with the guidelines and ethics approved
by the Animal Ethics Committee of the National Institute
of Agrobiological Sciences for the use of animals.
Cloning of full-length oPRP cDNAs
Full-length cDNAs of the novel oPRP1 and oPRP2 were isolated from ovine cotyledonary tissue by the 3'-rapid
amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method. In brief,
complete RNA was isolated from an ovine placentome on
day 45 of gestation using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene,
Toyama, Japan). We performed 3'-RACE using a 3'-full
RACE core set (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) with an oPRP-specific forward primer (5'-CTATGGTCAACAGGCGTCCTCA-3'). The oPRP primers were designed from bovine
PRP sequences. The 3'-RACE products were sequenced
using an ABI Prism 370 automatic sequencer (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) after cloning into a
pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
Phylogenetic analysis
The deduced oPRP1 and oPRP2 protein sequences were
aligned with the ruminant PRPs using the multiple alignment software Clustal W 1.83 on the DDBJ web site. Clustal W was also employed to calculate trees using the
Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method [52]. TreeView was used to
display the phylogenetic tree [53]. The values represent
bootstrap scores for 10,000 trials, indicating the credibility of each branch. Except for the oPRP1 and oPRP2
sequences, the ruminant PRL family protein sequences
were obtained from GenBank. Their GenBank accession
numbers are: bPRP1 (J02944), bPRP2 (M27239), bPRP3
(M27240), bPRP4 (M33269), bPRP5 (X15975), bPRP6
(AB245482), bPRP7 (AB187564), bPRP8 (AB196438),
bPRP9 (AB204881), bPRP11 (BK005438), bPRP12
(BK005439), bPRP13 (BK005440), bPRP14 (AB255602),
bPL-Ala (J02840), bPL-Val (M33268), bPRL (V00112),
oPL (M31660), oPRL (M27057), caprine PRL (cPRL:
X76049), cPRP1 (AB231295) and cPRP6 (AB231296).
The cPL sequence was obtained from Sakal et al. [4].

Three-dimensional structure prediction
We predicted the three-dimensional (3D) structures of
oPRP1 and oPRP2 using FAMS (Fully Automated Homology Modeling System) [54,55]. FAMS is a software program that predicts 3D models for target proteins on the
basis of the structures of proteins that are known to be
highly homologous. For oPRP1 and oPRP2, the 3D structure was constructed on the basis of that of human prolactin (hPRL) (Protein Data Bank ID: 1N9D). The FAMS
program requires only an amino acid sequence as input
and constructs 3D model structures automatically. The 3D
structures were visualized using RasMol 2.7.3 software
[56,57].
RT-PCR
The tissue distribution of oPRP1 and oPRP2 expression
was studied by RT-PCR. Ovine GAPDH was used as a positive control. Details of the RT-PCR method were
described previously [20,21]. The total RNA in a reaction
mixture was used for reverse transcription and template
cDNA synthesis using oligo(dT) primers and Superscript
III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at
50°C for 50 min. Each PCR contained the cDNA template, primers, deoxynucleotide triphosphate mixture
(dNTP), MgCl2, 10 × PCR buffer II, autoclaved milliQ
water and AmpliTaq gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). Amplification conditions included denaturation at 95°C for 30 s and extension at 72°C for 1 min.
Twenty-seven cycles were performed for all samples. The
annealing temperature was set at 58°C for 30 s. A single
denaturation step at 95°C for 10 min before the first PCR
cycle and a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min after
the last PCR cycle were also performed. The PCR products
were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The primers encoding
the oPRP1 and oPRP2 sequences were designed using our
obtained sequence. The designated primers are listed in
Table 2. The primers were commercially synthesized (Tsukuba Oligo Service, Tsukuba, Japan).
In situ hybridization
The full-length oPRP1 and oPRP2 cDNAs were used as
templates for hybridization probe synthesis. Digoxigenin

probes were prepared as described in previous studies
[20,21]. The placentomes were sectioned into 7 μm-thick
sections. In situ hybridization was performed using automated Ventana HX System Discovery with a RiboMapKit
and BlueMapKit (Ventana, Tucson, AZ, USA) [20,21].
Briefly, ovine placentomal sections were hybridized with
DIG-labeled probes in RiboHybe (Ventana) hybridization
solution at 67°C for 6 hours. The sections were washed
three times in RiboWash (Ventana) (67°C, 6 min) after
hybridization and fixed in RiboFix (Ventana) (both 37°C,
10 min). The hybridization signals were then detected
using a monoclonal-anti-digoxin biotin conjugate
(Sigma, Saint Louis, MI, USA). The hybridized slides were
observed after preparation with a Leica DMRE HC microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) with a
Fujix digital camera HC2500 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan).
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (QPCR)
Expression of oPRP1 and oPRP2 was confirmed quantitatively at each stage of gestation by QPCR using the Power
SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). Fifty
ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA for 30
min at 48°C using MultiScribe™ reverse transcriptase with
a random primer, dNTP mixture, MgCl2 and RNase inhibitor. After heat inactivation of the reverse transcriptase for
5 min at 95°C, PCR and the resulting relative increase in
reporter fluorescent dye emission were monitored in real
time using an Mx3000P QPCR system (Stratagene, La
Jolla, CA, USA). In the SYBR Green assay, primer pairs
were designed using the Primer Express software program
(Applied Biosystems). The primers for each gene are listed
in Table 3. Thermal-cycling conditions included initialsample incubation at 50°C for 2 min and at 95°C for 10
min, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s and at 60°C
for 1 min. The relative differences in the initial amounts
of each mRNA (or cDNA) species were determined by
comparing the CT values. Standard curves for each gene
were generated by serial dilution of the plasmid containing the corresponding cDNA to quantify the mRNA concentrations. We confirmed the melting curve for detecting
the SYBR Green-based objective amplicon, because SYBR
Green also detects any double-stranded DNA including
primer dimers, contaminating DNA, and PCR products
from misannealed primers. Contaminating DNA or
primer dimers would show up as a peak separate from the

desired amplicon peak. The expression ratio of each gene
to GAPDH mRNA was calculated to adjust for variations
in the RT-PCR reaction. All values are presented as means
± SEM. QPCR was replicated as follows: for the Day 45
and Day 95 samples, QPCR data were collected in biological duplicate from n = 3 animals and technical duplicates
(n = 2) were performed on one animal sample (six data in
total). For the Day 135 samples, QPCR data were collected
in biological duplicate (n = 2) and technical duplicate (n
= 2) from one animal sample (four data in total). Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey-Kramer multiple-comparison test.
Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05.
Production and purification of recombinant proteins
The oPRP2 sequences encoding the mature-protein
region, which combined the FLAG and 6 × His epitope tag
sequences, were inserted into a pFLAG-CMV-3 vector
(Sigma). The constructed plasmid was transfected into
HEK 293 cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel,
Switzerland) for transient transfection. Stably transfected
HEK 293 cells were adapted to suspension culture in a
spinner flask using 293 SFM II medium (Invitrogen,
Gibco) and cultured in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at
37°C for 3 days. The medium was separated by centrifugation.

Recombinant FLAG-tag and 6 × His-tag fusion proteins
were purified using the 6 × His-tag portion. Approximately 1 liter of conditioned medium was processed at a
time. Medium to which 1 ml Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow
(Amersham Bioscience, Buckinghamshire, UK) was added
was mixed and equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 300 mM NaCl and 20
mM imidazole. Only the 6 × His-tag proteins bind to the
Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow carrier. The medium with carrier
was chromatographed on a PD-10 column (Amersham
Bioscience). The fractions with carrier were washed with
20 mM imidazole. The fractions were eluted with 250 mM
imidazole.
Western blot analysis
One ng of purified protein was loaded on each lane, separated by SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred
on to a polyvinylidene-difluoride membrane [58]. West-

ern blotting was performed using the method of Towbin
et al. [59]. Briefly, the membrane was blocked in 10%
skimmed milk overnight and incubated with mouse antiFLAG M2 (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, followed
by incubation with anti-mouse IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) (diluted 1:3000) for 1 h at
room temperature. Immunopositive bands were stained
using NBT (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and BCIP (BioRad).
Bioassay of lactogenic activity using Nb2 lymphoma cells
Lactogenic activity was assessed by the rat Nb2 lymphoma
cell proliferation assay [60,61]. Nb2 lymphoma cells were
routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium
(DMEM) and Ham's F12 combined medium (1:1)
(Sigma) supplemented with 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol,
100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and
containing both 10% HS and 10% FBS (maintenance
medium: MM), in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air at
37°C. Twenty-four hours before initiation of the assay the
cells were harvested, washed with supplemented Fischer's
medium containing only 10% HS (stationary medium:
SM) and diluted to 1 × 106 cells/ml. At the initiation of the
assay, cells were washed and aliquotted into 16-mm wells
(1 × 106 cells/ml/well) of a 24-well culture plate. Ovine
prolactin (oPRL: positive control), bPL (positive control),
bPRP1 and oPRP2 preparations were added at various
concentrations and the cells were incubated for an additional 72 h. Samples of treated cells were collected and
counted in a Sysmex Microcell counter (Model CC-110;
TOA Medical Electronics, Tokyo, Japan). Treatments were
performed in quadruplicate.
