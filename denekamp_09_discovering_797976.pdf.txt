Abstract
Background: Microscopic monogonont rotifers, including the euryhaline species Brachionus
plicatilis, are typically found in water bodies where environmental factors restrict population growth
to short periods lasting days or months. The survival of the population is ensured via the
production of resting eggs that show a remarkable tolerance to unfavorable conditions and remain
viable for decades. The aim of this study was to generate Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) for
molecular characterisation of processes associated with the formation of resting eggs, their survival
during dormancy and hatching.
Results: Four normalized and four subtractive libraries were constructed to provide a resource
for rotifer transcriptomics associated with resting-egg formation, storage and hatching. A total of
47,926 sequences were assembled into 18,000 putative transcripts and analyzed using both Blast
and GO annotation. About 28–55% (depending on the library) of the clones produced significant
matches against the Swissprot and Trembl databases. Genes known to be associated with
desiccation tolerance during dormancy in other organisms were identified in the EST libraries.
These included genes associated with antioxidant activity, low molecular weight heat shock
proteins and Late Embryonic Abundant (LEA) proteins. Real-time PCR confirmed that LEA
transcripts, small heat-shock proteins and some antioxidant genes were upregulated in resting eggs,
therefore suggesting that desiccation tolerance is a characteristic feature of resting eggs even
though they do not necessarily fully desiccate during dormancy. The role of trehalose in restingegg formation and survival remains unclear since there was no significant difference between
resting-egg producing females and amictic females in the expression of the tps-1 gene. In view of
the absence of vitellogenin transcripts, matches to lipoprotein lipase proteins suggest that, similar
to the situation in dipterans, these proteins may serve as the yolk proteins in rotifers.
Conclusion: The 47,926 ESTs expand significantly the current sequence resource of B. plicatilis. It
describes, for the first time, genes putatively associated with resting eggs and will serve as a
database for future global expression experiments, particularly for the further identification of
dormancy related genes.

Background
The phylum Rotifera is a relatively small group of microscopic aquatic or semi-aquatic invertebrates, encompassing about 2,000 species of unsegmented, bilaterally
symmetrical pseudocoelomates. The species under study,
the monogonont rotifer Brachionus plicatilis, is a zooplanktonic invertebrate, typically found in water bodies where
environmental factors restrict population growth to short
periods lasting days or months. The adverse conditions
for growth include evaporation of water in temporary
habitats leading to desiccation, unfavorable temperatures,
and lack of food or appearance of predators. This is a relatively hostile environment and the survival of the population in such conditions is ensured via the production of
resting eggs. These show a remarkable tolerance to unfavorable conditions and may be stored for decades [1,2].
Their high reproductive rates facilitate colonization of
vacant niches with extreme rapidity, converting primary
production (algal and bacterial) into a form usable for
secondary consumers with remarkable efficiency [3]. Consequently, the euryhaline rotifer Brachionus plicatilis, has
been developed as an essential food source for raising
marine fish larvae in marine fish hatcheries (reviewed in
[4]).
Brachionus plicatilis shows periodic parthenogenesis,
where asexual reproduction is prevalent but under certain
circumstances sexual reproduction occurs (Figure 1). Parthenogenesis dominates (amictic phase) the monogonont
life cycle in the absence of males, but following certain
environmental cues, sexual reproduction (mictic phase)
takes place. Females that reproduce asexually are termed
"amictic" and females that reproduce sexually are "mictic". Amictic females produce diploid eggs that develop by
ameiotic pathenogenesis into females. Mictic females are
morphologically similar to amictic females but produce
haploid (mictic) eggs via meiosis. These eggs will develop
parthenogenetically into haploid males but if these mictic
females are fertilized they will produce diploid resting
eggs. The haploid males are significantly smaller than the
females and move faster. The mictic females produce resting eggs only if they are inseminated at a young age. Resting-egg production is therefore a consequence of
switching from an asexual type of reproduction to sexual
reproduction. Resting eggs then undergo obligatory diapause or dormancy, eventually hatching as amictic
females [2,5-8]. It has also been suggested that certain
clones show a higher tendency for sexual reproduction
and resting-egg production than others, within the same
population [9,10]. The factors inducing the mixis signal
are largely unknown, although population density and
environmental factors such as salinity, presence of pheromones and food availability have been shown to play a
role [11-15].

Clues for the biological processes underlying the dormant
stage can be inferred from other organisms, such as
spores, plant seeds, cysts or resting eggs that display cryptobiosis where the metabolic rate is extremely low (~5%
of normal) and associated with profound changes within
the cell [16,17]. Cryptobiosis is associated with desiccation or anhydrobiosis and involves protectants that stabilize cellular macromolecules for periods extending many
years [17]. These processes are often associated with the
onset of stressful environmental conditions. However,
production of rotifer resting eggs is not always stress
related and resting eggs do not necessarily undergo desiccation during their dormant period and therefore it
remains to be shown whether these eggs express genes
associated with stress resistance and desiccation tolerance.
To date, there have been very few molecular studies on B.
plicatilis and these have been mainly limited to single gene
studies on aging and environmental contamination [1820] and a small-scale EST project [21]. None of these
relate to resting-egg formation or dormancy.
The aim of the present study was to develop EST resources
of B. plicatilis for future molecular analyses into the dormancy process in this organism. Four EST libraries were
constructed: a mixed stage rotifer culture, females with
resting eggs, resting eggs and resting eggs during hatching.
The libraries were normalized in order to increase the
chances of discovering rarely expressed genes. In addition,
four subtractive libraries were constructed with the aim of
enhancing the gene diversity of the ESTs. In this paper we
characterize the EST libraries and identify putative genes
associated with dormancy, formation and survival of
rotifer resting eggs.

Results and discussion
A total of 47,926 sequences remained after clone sequencing and quality checking and these had a minimum transcript size of 100 bp and an average of 538 bp. Sequencing
effort was concentrated on the normalized libraries,
which comprised 91.2% of the dataset, with between
21.5–24.9% contributed by each library (Table 1). Preliminary sequencing was performed on the subtractive libraries (approximately 1000 clones each) and therefore these
only comprise 8.8% of the EST sequences (Table 2). The
gene discovery and diversity rates of all libraries are relatively high (0.53–0.68 and 0.36–0.46 respectively) with
the exception of the sbs04 subtractive library. Gene discovery is defined as the number of different "genes" each
library contributed, divided by library size and gene diversity is defined as the number of singletons in each library
divided by library size [22].
In spite of the subtractive process, this library was still
highly redundant, potentially indicating massive gene
redundancy within mictic females and their associated

Figure cycle of Brachionus plicatilis showing asexual and sexual reproduction and formation of resting eggs
The life 1
The life cycle of Brachionus plicatilis showing asexual and sexual reproduction and formation of resting eggs. In
the asexual life cycle, diploid amictic females produce parthenogenetic diploid amictic eggs. A mixis signal initiates the occurrence of a sexual cycle, whereby, diploid mictic females produce haploid eggs via meiosis. The haploid eggs develop into either
haploid males or, if fertilized, they form diploid dormant (or diapausing) resting eggs. The internal insemination of diploid mictic
females carrying haploid eggs, is possible for only a few hours after birth. Mictic females are shaded in grey and include mictic
females producing male eggs or mictic females that form diploid resting eggs. All females are diploid while males are haploid.

resting eggs. Ten contigs comprise 27.4% of the library
sequences. Three of the ten contigs (7.7% of the library)
show no match to known sequences in the database and
four contigs (12.9%) have a highly repeated amino acid
structure, which cannot be ascribed to a particular gene or
gene family (Table 3). None of these highly repeated proteins show similar homologies to each other, being 36–
40% identical at the nucleotide level. One contig (clone
sbs04P0012K21) shows similarity to putative oxidoreductases. This classification is applied to all enzymes that

have oxidoreductase functions, however some are
involved in acting on superoxide radicals, which are produced during stressful situations (c.f. resting eggs). Also of
significant interest are the two other matches to ferritin
(pearl oyster) and hsp26 (Artemia urmiana). In studies on
the crustacean Artemia franciscana, which forms cysts in
response to adverse conditions, two proteins were shown
to be present in large amounts in the cysts; hsp26 and
artemin (a ferritin homologue) [23,24]. This situation is

clearly mirrored in the sbs04 library and these transcripts
represent potential markers for resting eggs.
When similarity searches were run on the processed
sequences from all the libraries, approximately 50% produced significant matches (expect score in excess of 1e-10
and therefore can be regarded as putative known genes)
against the sequence databases. This percentage identification is much lower than a recently published EST library
of B. plicatilis [21], in which 80% of sequences showed
similarity to database entries.
However, the number of ESTs in the Suga library was relatively small (2,362 ESTs), non-normalised and a significant proportion of the sequences formed a single cluster
encoding the small ribosomal sub-unit. In total, almost
23% of the 2,362 ESTs were comprised of 14 clusters with
matches ranging from cathepsin L to beta tubulin. Comparison of our ESTs with those of Suga et al., [21] using
BLASTN (E value < 10-10) showed that 93% of the ESTs in
the Suga library were represented in our dataset.
The main objective of this EST project was to develop transcriptome resources for B. plicatilis, which could be used in
future global expression experiments. Therefore, the strategy of normalization and subtraction was used in library
production. Although this should maximize the number
of different transcripts obtained, it does mean that quan-

titative comparisons between libraries is not possible
without further verification. Given this limitation, analyses were targeted at candidate genes involved in maintaining the stability and the integrity of cell compartments
and macromolecules, as these are key factors for survival
during dormancy. Searches were carried out using both
BLAST and GO annotations and identified genes designated as or involved in:
• Protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
detoxification: ROS are toxic in all life stages but they
are especially problematic for dormant forms. In plant
seeds desiccation causes loss of control mechanisms
that maintain low ROS concentrations, thus the antioxidant activity has great importance [25].
• Maintaining the native folded conformation of proteins: changes in osmotic pressure, pH or temperature
as well as desiccation all challenge protein conformation [26] and may cause the formation of cytotoxic
protein aggregates.
• Late Embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins: which
have been shown to be involved in desiccation in a
number of organisms [27].
• Trehalose biosynthesis: trehalose is well-known to
be present in high concentrations in the dormant

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:108

stages of various organisms [17] and small amounts
have been found previously in B. plicatilis desiccated
resting eggs [28].
• Aquaporins: these are transmembrane proteins that
serve as channels for water and small soluble molecules transport [29] and have been found to be important for desiccation tolerance in seeds [30] and for
freeze tolerance in yeast [31].
• Lipids and fatty acid metabolism: lipid metabolism
is associated with hibernation in mammals [32] and
the dauer form in nematodes [33]. Vitellogenins are
lipoproteins forming the yolk proteins [34,35].
Protection against ROS and detoxification
A number of clones were identified associated with antioxidant activity GO term (GO:0016209), which was specifically narrowed to encompass clones encoding
glutathione S transferases (Table 4). These genes belong to
a superfamily of multifunctional proteins with fundamental roles in cellular detoxification, participating in the
second phase detoxification and removal of xenobiotics
after the action of P450 [36]. They are widespread among

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/108

all organisms. In total, 129 putative transcripts for glutathione S-transferase (E value between 9.0 e-17 – 2.0 e-45)
were found in all the normalized libraries and in the
sbs04 library (seven contigs and five singletons). More indepth analysis revealed that these 129 transcripts comprise 11 distinct putative genes (designated Bpa-gst-1 to
Bpa-gst-11, where Bpa stands for Brachionus plicatilis Atlit),
which on sequence similarity searching appear to most
closely match the alpha class of cytosolic GSTs. This is by
far the most abundant of cytosolic subfamilies often comprising tens of members in each species [36] (c.f. 44 annotated GSTs identified in C. elegans [37]). Five of the
putative rotifer GSTs show closest sequence matches to C.
elegans genes, all of which are heavily documented in
Wormbase with regard to expression and functional studies. Whilst those GSTs most similar to the rotifer transcripts all show expression responses to electrophilic
stress [38], interestingly GST-5 occurred in an expression
cluster
of
strongly
regulated
dauer
genes
(WBPaper00024393; [39]). Although functions of genes
(even orthologues) differ between species, and this is particularly the case with multiple gene family members, the
dauer is a stage of larval arrest in C. elegans, which could
equate functionally to the resting-egg stage in the rotifer.

Indeed, this gene was only found in the resting-egg
library, clearly a candidate for further investigation. No
GSTs were found in the first three subtractive libraries, but
this may not be surprising given the small sample size of
the sequencing effort, or alternatively, their number was
small as a consequence of subtractions.
Further searches for antioxidant enzymes identified 135
clones, which assembled into 11 putative transcripts coding for peroxiredoxins (E values between 10-27 to 10-77)
and thioredoxin peroxidase activity (E value of 10-57)
(data not shown). Members of these families were found
in all normalized libraries and Bpa-trpx-6 and Bpa-trpx-7
were additionally found in the sbs04 library associated
with resting eggs (data not shown). Antioxidant activity is
also associated with the enzyme phospholipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase, which protects membranes
from oxidative stress by reducing the membrane
hydroperoxides [40]. Twenty-nine clones were found to
be associated with phospholipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase activity (GO:0047066) in the EST libraries and two putative transcripts were produced after contig
assembly and were named gpx1 and gpx2. The transcript
gpx1 was only found in the MS and sbs01 libraries, whilst
gpx2 was found in all the normalized libraries. BLAST
results for the two transcripts were quite different: gpx1
matched mammalian glutathione peroxidase 3 (E value =
10-42) and gpx2 matched phosphlipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase of hydra and cattle tick (E value = 1020), and of mammals (E value 10-18), although both confer antioxidant protection. The presence of two genes indicates a duplication of the gpx genes in the rotifer.
Dismutases catalyze the conversion of superoxide radicals
into hydrogen peroxide, preventing their conversion into
the more active hydroxyl radical [25]. Five putative transcripts were found to be associated with superoxide dismutase activity (GO:0004784). Two transcripts show
homology with the Mn-SOD (E value = 10-111) previously
described by [19]. Three other transcripts were found to
be similar to Cu/Zn-SOD. Transcripts were found across
several different libraries and so could be designated as
ubiquitous. However, the previously identified Mn-SOD
of B. plicatilis was found to be over-expressed in rotifers
with an extended life span resulting from caloric restriction [19]. Similarly in C. elegans, the DAF pathway (insulin, dauer associated) is also linked to caloric restriction
and increased lifespan. Therefore these genes clearly have
other roles in addition to putative functions associated
with desiccation.
Maintaining the native folded conformation of proteins
Changes in environmental conditions (e.g. osmotic pressure, pH, temperature and desiccation), challenge protein
structure and may cause the formation of cytotoxic pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/108

tein aggregates and induce the production of "stress" proteins [41]. Therefore, desiccation tolerant resting eggs
need to develop mechanisms for coping with denaturing
and aggregation of proteins. The classical cellular
response to this type of stress is the induction of "heat
shock" or chaperone proteins [42-44] which facilitate the
disaggregation of proteins and their refolding to native
conformation, and/or the production of small heat shock
proteins, which prevent initial protein aggregation [26].
BLAST searches revealed 10 putative transcripts (6 contigs
and 4 singletons) with matches to the HSP70 superfamily.
Further analysis narrowed this to 6 putative genes as four
of the sequences were potentially non-overlapping sections of the same genes (Table 5). Of the six putative
genes, three showed significant sequence similarity to the
classical stress inducible HSP70 gene (Bpa-hsp70-1, Bpahsp70-3 and Bpa-hsp-6). The best database match to this
gene was from the organism Microplitis mediator, an
orthopteran parasite and interestingly the publication
annotation associated with this entry [SwissProt:A8D4R0] indicates that this gene is associated with
diapause. All other putative genes are HSP70 family members and although the functional annotation is variable,
all are potentially involved in the stress response. HSPA9
(Bpa-hsp70-4) is additionally implicated in the control of
cell proliferation and cellular aging, whilst GRP170 (Bpahsp70-5) has a pivotal role in cytoprotection, specifically
triggered in response to hypoxia [45], both factors which
are almost certainly associated with resting-egg formation.
None of the rotifer sequences showed any significant similarity to the rotifer HSP70 sequence previously isolated
[DDBJ:AB076052]), which is most similar to the constitutive form of this family (HSC70) and has been shown to
be expressed during population growth [18]. Members of
the HSP70 family were found in all normalized libraries
and in two of the subtracted libraries.
Although members of the HSP70 family are regarded as
the classical cellular stress response, the small heat shock
proteins are being increasingly identified as having a pivotal role in survival in stressful conditions and metabolic
arrest [23]. Encysted embryos of Artemia franciscana have
been shown to contain substantial amounts of HSP26
[46,47] along with a ferritin homologue [24], with both
molecules acting as chaperones to prevent protein aggregation.
A search for small heat-shock proteins revealed five putative transcripts (5 contigs). One primarily matched an αcrystallin protein, (Ornithodoros parkeri, E value = 7·1013), but this is not surprising as the α-crystalline domains
are characteristic of small heat shock proteins [26] and
indeed all the deduced amino acid sequences of putative
rotifer small HSPs described here contain an α-crystallin

conserved domain. This first transcript was found exclusively in the normalized libraries containing resting eggs
(RE and FRE). Four additional different transcripts were
identified in the subtractive sbs04 library (Table 6). Overall, small HSP transcripts were highly represented in the
sbs04 library comprising 55 clones out of 1203 (~4.5%),
and significantly, this was the only subtracted library to
contain resting eggs. The sequence similarity of the putative rotifer small HSPs to small HSPs in the databases was
low, in the region of 30% identity, but the small HSPs,
contrary to the situation with HSP70, are not highly conserved between species. For example, comparing
sequences from C. briggsae [Swiss-Prot:A8XDE7] to C. ele-

gans [Swiss-Prot:P02513] and the pink hibiscus mealy bug
[Swiss-Prot:A2I3W3] produces 28.6% amino acid identity/46% amino acid similarity and 29.2% identity/42.6%
similarity, respectively. Given this lack of conservation,
and that BLAST matches of the rotifer sequences were
exclusive to other small HSPs, it is reasonable to assume
that putative genes coding for small heat shock proteins
are found in rotifers, particularly in resting eggs.
Regarding additional candidates for further investigation
in resting-egg stage gene expression, a number of other
heat shock proteins were identified (HSP60 and HSP80100). Induction of the HSP60 protein was previously

shown in B. plicatilis in response to various environmental
pollutants [20,48], and also in Plationus patulus in
response to arsenic and heavy metal exposure [49] and
therefore are potential "stress" proteins. Eleven putative
transcripts with matches to HSP60 were found, as were
putative transcripts with matches to other high molecular
weight heat-shock proteins (HSP80-100). These candidates were found in all of the normalized libraries.
Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) proteins
LEA proteins were originally identified in plant seeds during the late stages of embryonic development and are
associated with desiccation tolerance throughout the life
cycle of all major plant taxa [50]. They comprise a protein
family with three major groups (Groups 1–3). They have
also been found in non-plant species and to date almost
all non-plant LEA proteins belong to Group 3 [51]. LEAs
have been found in the nematode Aphelenchus avenae [52],
bdelliod rotifers [53,54] and desiccated A. franciscana
cysts [55]. The exact function of LEA proteins is as yet,
unknown, but their importance in desiccation and stress
tolerance has been comprehensively demonstrated. For
example, silencing of the lea gene in C. elegans dauer juveniles caused a significant reduction of worm survival during induction of desiccation and in osmotic and heat
stresses [56]. LEA proteins were found to prevent protein
aggregation in vitro [57]. Also, in vivo experiments using
Aphelenchus avenae LEA proteins introduced into human
cell lines demonstrated that these proteins played a role in
anti-aggregation and protein stabilisation during desiccation procedures [58].

Three transcripts matching group 3 LEA proteins on
BLAST sequence similarity analyses were identified (E values in the range of 1E-11 – 5E-25). These have been designated bpa-lea-1, bpa-lea-2 and bpa-lea-3 (Table 7). A rooted
NJ tree was produced using translations of these transcripts with canonical plant LEA proteins from all three
major groups [59] and the metazoan LEA proteins of C.
elegans, A. franciscana, P. vanderplanki, and A. avenae (Figure 2). The putative rotifer genes were associated with the
Group 3 protein family.

Trehalose metabolism
Trehalose is thought to play an important role in enhancing desiccation and stress tolerance [60]. For example,
accumulation of trehalose has been shown in diapausing
cysts of Artemia [61] and also the stress responses of nematodes [62,63]. Trehalose is synthesized from glucose, catalyzed by the enzymes trehalose-6-phosphate synthase
(tps) and trehalose phosphatase [64]. Trehalose can comprise ~17% of the dry mass in Artemia undergoing desiccation [65] and small amounts (0.35% of dry weight)
have previously been found in B. plicatilis desiccated resting eggs [28]. Also a transcript [DDBJ: BJ979617] with
high sequence similarity to the tps gene, encoding to trehalose phosphate synthase, was previously identified in
an EST library of B. plicatilis [21].

Ten ESTs (1 contig and 7 singletons) were identified in the
different libraries for trehalose-6-phosphate synthase but
there was no particular association with the libraries containing resting eggs. In-depth analysis revealed that the
ten ESTs could be assigned to three groups comprising
non-overlapping regions of the tps gene. In spite of this
fragmentation, it was possible to identify that two paralogues (Table 8) were present and that the rotifer, like C.
elegans, has a duplication of the tps gene [62]. Other
model organisms, such as the insects Drosophila melanogaster, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae and baker's yeast,
S. cerevisiae [66] possess only a single tps gene, but this
may be a reflection on lifestyle and the requirement to
survive stressful conditions. In support of this, phylogenetic analysis has shown adaptive selection operating on
the glucose-6-phosphate branch point enzymes and adjacent pathways (including tps) with the conclusion that
this evolutionary pressure has played a significant role in
metabolic adaptation [67]. The C. elegans paralogues
showed only 48% identity overall, but they were slightly
different lengths (1229 amino acids [Swiss-Prot:O45380]
(F19H8.1)
and
1331
amino
acids
[SwissProt:Q7YZT6](ZK54.2)) and particularly differed at the 5'
and 3' ends. The two fragments of tps from the rotifer were
88.9% identical at the amino acid level, but these fragments did include the most conserved central portion of

the gene and therefore the overall figure for amino acid
conservation will be much lower if the whole sequence of
each gene is compared.
Given the data and the nature of the way the libraries were
produced it is not possible to determine the role of trehalose in resting-egg formation and survival solely using this
data. In addition to the duplication of the trehalose-6phosphate synthase gene in C. elegans, this species also
shows a duplication of the trehalase gene, the enzyme
which breaks down trehalose. In fact, there are four trehalase genes annotated in Ensembl [W05E10.4, F57B10.7,
T05A12.2 and C23H3.7] [66]. BLAST searches of the
rotifer data produced three singletons with matches to trehalase (data not shown). Although these were single reads
and therefore sequence quality was variable, there were
sufficient differences between the putative translations of
these clones to indicate that they were potentially three
different genes, demonstrating another situation analogous with the nematode. Although the C. elegans
sequences are similar at the sequence level to other characterized trehalases (hence the annotation), they are designated as "unknown function", as RNAi studies produce
no obvious phenotype. It has yet to be determined why
there are four copies of this gene in C. elegans and what is
the exact function of each paralogue. By extrapolation the
same can be inferred for the three putative trehalases in
the rotifer.

Aquaporins
Aquaprorins are transmembrane proteins that serve as
channels for water and small soluble molecules transport
[29]. These proteins have been found to play a role in desiccation tolerance in seeds [30] and freeze tolerance in
yeast [31]. Three different putative aquaporin transcripts
were identified in the EST libraries (Table 9) with E values
in the range of 6E-22 – 1E-26. These were designated: bpaaqp-1, bpa-aqp-2 and bpa-aqp-3. Exact assignment of these
putative rotifer genes to aquaporin family members was
difficult because of relatively short sequence lengths and
low percentage similarity to aquaporin genes already in
the databases. However, on BLAST assignment, the first
two transcripts matched aquaporins 3, 7, 9 or 10, which
are glycerol channels, while the third matched aquaporins
4, 2, 1 or the plant protein TIP. These genes are under further investigation and full length transcripts are being
generated by RACE PCR for functional analyses.
Lipid and fatty acid metabolism
Also of interest were genes associated with lipid metabolism as this may be the only source for energy whilst
embryonic development is arrested and during hatching if
similarities are assumed with other dormant or hibernating organisms. For example lipid metabolic pathways
were up-regulated in the C. elegans dauer larval stage [33].
Lipids also serve as the main energy source in hibernating
mammals [32]. Resting eggs contain extremely large num-

bers of droplets with neutral lipids [68] and these may
serve as the only source for biosynthetic processes during
dormancy and hatching via the glyoxylate cycle and gluconeogenesis. There were 28 clones (4 contigs and 2 singletons) matching lipoprotein lipase (Table 10) in the
libraries. Lipoprotein lipases are also known to serve as
yolk proteins in dipterans eggs [69], in contrast to vitellogenins that are the main yolk proteins in almost all egg
forming organisms [34,70]. Surprisingly, no BLAST
matches were identified for vitellogenin, suggesting that
lipoprotein lipase may serve as a yolk protein of B. plicatilis. Allied to the possession of lipoprotein lipases are fatty
acid-binding proteins (FABP) which are assumed to be
involved in fatty acid uptake, transport and metabolism.
These proteins are members of the lipocalin superfamily
that are transporters of small hydrophobic molecules such
as lipids, steroid hormones, bilins and retinoids [71].
Both fatty acid and retinoid binding may be important for
resting-egg formation as fatty acids may serve as an energy
source during dormancy and retinoids are associated with
embryonic development [72,73]. Five putative transcripts
were identified as lipocalins (Table 11). For each transcript, the highest number of clones within the normalized libraries was found in library FRE (females with
resting eggs) and one transcript was also found in library
sbs04. These results may suggest a role of lipocalins in
resting-egg production.
Expression experiments
Since all libraries were produced using either normalized
or subtractive methods, real-time PCR experiments were

conducted in order to assess the expression of selected
genes in resting eggs and in resting-egg producing females
(see [additional file 1] Table S1). The expression patterns
of the selected genes were determined in resting eggs relative to amictic eggs, and in resting-egg producing females
relative to amictic females (Fig. 3). It should be noted that
in all cases the 95% confidence limits in the female samples were expanded compared to those of the egg samples.
This may be attributed to the larger inherent variability
between females, related to their age and size.
Genes upregulated in resting eggs include all the lea-like
transcripts, a small heat shock protein and two of the
genes involved in antioxidant activities: one of the glutathione S-transferases (Bpa-gst-8) and a superoxide dismutase (Mn-sod-2). Two gst-like transcripts were chosen
for analysis: Bpa-gst-8, identified in the normalized libraries associated with resting eggs (RE, FRE) and also the subtracted library containing resting eggs, and gst-2 found in
all the normalized libraries. As mentioned above, gst-8 is
up-regulated in resting eggs and in resting-egg producing
females. No significant change in the expression of gst-2
was found in resting eggs relative to amictic eggs but it was
slightly up-regulated in resting-egg producing females.
Therefore, the two gene family members clearly play different roles in cellular defense mechanisms.
The relative expression of tps-1 transcript was determined
in order to evaluate the significance of trehalose synthesis
in resting-egg production. The results do not show any significant change in the expression of the tps-1 like gene in

resting eggs relative to amictic eggs or in resting-egg producing females relative to amictic females. Hence, the
expression pattern of the tps-like transcript suggests that
this gene may not be associated with resting-egg production, although it cannot be discounted that trehalose production is regulated at the translational level or enzyme
activity rather than the transcriptional level.

Conclusion
The production of both normalized and subtractive EST
libraries from different samples of rotifer including resting-egg producing females, resting eggs and resting eggs
during hatching, resulted in a high coverage of the transcriptome of Brachionus plicatilis. A total of 47,926 clones
were sequenced, and these were assembled into 18,000
putative transcripts. Genes known to be associated with
desiccation tolerance in other organisms were identified
in the EST libraries. These included genes associated with
antioxidant activity, low molecular weight heat shock proteins and LEA proteins. Real-time PCR confirmed that LEA
transcripts, small HSPs and some antioxidant genes were
upregulated in resting eggs, therefore suggesting that desiccation tolerance is a characteristic feature of resting eggs
even though they do not necessarily fully desiccate during
dormancy. Production of trehalose is commonly associated with dormancy and genes associated with trehalose
synthesis were found in all the normalized libraries. However, the role of trehalose in resting-egg formation and
survival remains unclear since there was no significant difference between resting-egg producing females and amictic females in the expression of tps-1 gene. Matches to
lipoprotein lipase proteins suggest that, similar to the situation in dipterans, these proteins may serve as the yolk
protein in rotifers and probably not vitellogenin, that is
found in most other egg producing organisms. The 18,000
Brachionus plicatilis putative transcripts will serve as a database for future global expression experiments, particularly
for the further identification of dormancy related genes.

Methods
Rotifer cultures and sample collection
Rotifers were hatched from resting eggs produced in the
laboratory from rotifers collected at a seaside pond in
Atlit, (40 km south of Haifa, Israel) in 1981. Some of the
resting eggs were hatched in 2003 and resting eggs produced from them were stored in the laboratory. Resting
eggs from 1981 and 2003 were stored in the dark at 4°C
and hatched in 2005. Four groups of samples were collected for libraries; (I) mixed stage cultures containing
both amictic and mictic females, (II) Resting eggs (RE),
(III) resting eggs during hatching and (IV) mictic females
with resting eggs

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/108

(I) Mixed stage rotifer cultures
Four cloned cultures and one non-cloned culture were
grown in 400 ml sea water medium (40‰). The rotifers
were fed with the algae Nannochloropsis sp. Mixis was
induced by transferring the cultures to diluted sea water
medium (20‰). Samples were collected when males
appeared in the cultures. Samples for RNA extraction were
collected by sieving the upper part of the culture with a
plankton net (60 μm mesh). Rotifers were washed with
sterile 20‰ diluted sea water and were re-suspended for
1 hr in sterile 20‰ diluted sea water, in order to allow
rotifers to empty their gut content. Rotifers were sieved
again with the plankton net, washed with sterile diluted
sea water (20‰) and transferred into a 1.5 ml centrifuge
tube. The rotifers were concentrated using a by short centrifugation step. The pellet containing the rotifers was frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -70°C until required for
RNA extraction.
(II) resting egg collection
About 30,000 resting eggs were collected from two 400 ml
of a non-cloned cultures that were maintained in 10‰
diluted sea water.
(III) resting eggs during hatching
Resting eggs were stored for three months in the dark at
25°C. Hatching was initiated by exposing the resting eggs
to light. Samples were collected 20 and 30 hrs after the initiation of hatching initiation and used for the construction of the cDNA library.
(IV) Mictic females with resting eggs
Females with resting eggs were hand picked from cultures,
due to their low abundance in the mixed cultures. About
1,000 females with resting eggs were picked from a cloned
culture (clone 1B4) grown in a 400 ml 20‰ diluted sea
water medium. This culture was also used for the production of the subtractive libraries.
RNA extraction and library preparation
RNA was extracted with the TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen)
following the manufacturer instructions. cDNA was synthesized using the SMART approach (SMART PCR cDNA
synthesis kit, Clontech, U.S.A.) and subsequently normalized using duplex-specific nuclease (Trimmer kit, Evrogen, Russia) according to manufacturer's instructions and
directionally cloned into pAL32 (Evrogen, Russia). Subtractive cDNAs were constructed by suppression subtractive hybridization (Evrogen, Russia) and cloned via the
TOPO TA® cloning system (Invitrogen, U.S.A.). Plasmids
were transferred via electroporation into E. coli DH10B
(Invitrogen, U.S.A.). Plasmids from the normalized libraries were 5' end sequenced using the pALforward primer
(5'-CTCGGGAAGCGCGCCATT-3') and Big Dye Termina-

tor chemistry. Clones of the subtractive libraries were
sequenced from both ends using T7 and T3 primers.
Sequences were determined on ABI 3730XL capillary
sequencers (Applied Biosystems, USA).
cDNA libraries construction and characterisation
Four normalized libraries and four subtractive libraries
were constructed:

MS: Normalized library of a mixed population consisting
of amictic females, mictic females and males. The library
was generated from a combination of four cloned cultures
and one non-cloned culture
RE: Normalized library of resting eggs. The resting eggs
were obtained from a non-cloned culture.
REH: Normalized library of resting eggs in various stages
of hatching. The library was constructed from resting eggs
that were hatched for 20 or 30 hrs.
FRE: Normalized library of mictic females with resting
eggs. The females were collected from a resting-egg producing clone (clone 1B4).
sbs01: Subtractive library of a mixed stage population
from a combination of cloned and non-cloned cultures
(tester) vs. mixed stage population of a clone 1B4 (driver)
sbs02: Subtractive library of a mixes stage population of
clone 1B4 (tester) vs. a mixed stage population of a combination of cloned and non-cloned cultures (driver).
sbs03: Subtractive library of a mixed stage population of
clone 1B4 (tester) vs. mictic females with resting eggs of
clone 1B4 (driver).
sbs04: Subtractive library of mictic females with resting
eggs as tester vs. mixed stage population of clone 1B4
(driver).

annotations were then used to map Gene Ontology identifiers [80]. Sequence manipulation was carried out using
the EMBOSS suite of programs [81]. Multiple sequence
alignments of LEA proteins were performed using the
ClustalW program. [82]. Phylogenetic trees were drawn
with MEGA4 [83] using the Bacillus subtilis glucose
inducible starvation protein B (Accession no: P26907) as
an outgroup.
Real-Time PCR experiments
The relative abundance of bpa-lea-1, bpa-lea-2, bpa-lea-3,
bpa-shsp-3, bpa-mnsod-2, bpa-cusod-1, bpa-gst-11, bpa-gst-4,
bpa-tps-1 transcripts (see [additional file 1] Table S1 for
the list of primers) were normalized to an elongation factor 1α housekeeping sequence using the equation: ratio =
(Etarget)CP_target/(Eef1a)CP_ef1a where E = 10-1/slop, according
to the method described by Pfaffl et al., [84]. The PCR
mixture consisted of 1 μl of cDNA sample, 70 nM of each
primer and 12.5 μl of SYBR Green master mix (ABgene,
UK), in a final volume of 25 μl. Amplification were preformed with biological triplicate samples using a
GenAmp 5700 thermocycler (PE Applied Biosystems,
USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

data and was in charge of writing the final version of the
manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.

Additional material
Sequence analysis and EST clustering
Sequence fasta files were processed using the script
Trace2dbest [74], which incorporated the phred and
crossmatch programmes [75,76]. A minimum cut-off
value of 100bp was applied after quality control processing for generating the submission file for EMBL (Accession numbers, FM897377–FM945301). Tgicl [77] was
used for clustering the fasta files, incorporating quality
scores, for each of the five libraries, as well as for all the
libraries together. The clusters were database searched
using Blastx [78] against the Uniprot/Swissprot and Uniprot/Trembl databases [79], with matches annotated for
all scores with an expect score in excess of 1e-10. These
