Abstract
Background: Microbial denitrification is not considered important in human-associated microbial communities.
Accordingly, metabolic investigations of the microbial biofilm communities of human dental plaque have focused
on aerobic respiration and acid fermentation of carbohydrates, even though it is known that the oral habitat is
constantly exposed to nitrate (NO3-) concentrations in the millimolar range and that dental plaque houses bacteria
that can reduce this NO3- to nitrite (NO2-).
Results: We show that dental plaque mediates denitrification of NO3- to nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), and
dinitrogen (N2) using microsensor measurements, 15N isotopic labelling and molecular detection of denitrification
genes. In vivo N2O accumulation rates in the mouth depended on the presence of dental plaque and on salivary
NO3- concentrations. NO and N2O production by denitrification occurred under aerobic conditions and was
regulated by plaque pH.
Conclusions: Increases of NO concentrations were in the range of effective concentrations for NO signalling to
human host cells and, thus, may locally affect blood flow, signalling between nerves and inflammatory processes in
the gum. This is specifically significant for the understanding of periodontal diseases, where NO has been shown
to play a key role, but where gingival cells are believed to be the only source of NO. More generally, this study
establishes denitrification by human-associated microbial communities as a significant metabolic pathway which,
due to concurrent NO formation, provides a basis for symbiotic interactions.

Background
The human body is naturally colonised by a diverse
array of micro-organisms whose metabolic activity is
important for human physiology and health [1]. Most
studies that assess the functional potentials and controls
of these complex communities rely on: (i) the characterisation of individual isolates or enrichments, (ii) quantification of micro-organisms that are thought to mediate
a certain process, or (iii) metagenomic analysis of a certain body region. Established methods of microbial ecology that allow the direct measurement of metabolic
conversions in natural microbial samples from humans
under different experimental conditions, such as incubation with isotopically-labelled substrates, dye probes for
specific compounds combined with microscopy or electrochemical microsensors, are rarely reported. However,
different microbial pathways, including fermentation,

sulfate reduction, methanogenesis and acetogenesis
[2-5], have been proposed to occur in humans. Surprisingly, denitrification (the respiratory reduction of nitrate
(NO3-) or nitrite (NO2-) via nitric oxide (NO) to nitrous
oxide (N 2 O) or dinitrogen (N 2 ) [6]) is believed to be
insignificant in human-associated microbial communities [7], even though NO3- and NO2- co-occur in significant concentrations with micro-organisms in various
body regions, such as the human oral cavity [8].
Denitrification is performed by facultative anaerobic
micro-organisms and is coupled to the oxidation of
reduced organic carbon or reduced inorganic compounds, such as ferrous iron, hydrogen sulfide or hydrogen [6,9]. The reductive sequence (NO3- > NO2- > NO
> N2O > N2) of denitrification is mediated by periplasmic and membrane-bound enzymes specific for each
step. The most important genes for the detection of
denitrification in complex microbial samples are narG
for NO3- reductase, nirS and nirK for NO2- reductases,
qnorB or cnorB for NO reductases, and nosZ for N2O
reductase. Denitrifying bacteria release NO or N2O as

intermediates during metabolic activity in pure culture
[10,11] and in complex microbial communities, such as
soils [12], nitrogen cycling biofilms [13] and ingested
bacteria within different invertebrates guts [14,15].
Notably, human saliva contains NO3- concentrations
in the millimolar range, because dietary NO3- is concentrated in salivary glands after it is absorbed from the
intestine into the blood [8]. Thus, the human-associated
microbial biofilm community of dental plaque and bacteria that cover other oral surfaces are exposed to NO3-.
However, investigations of plaque metabolism have
focused on aerobic respiration and acid fermentation of
carbohydrates [16]. Experiments with rat tongues as well
as tooth and other surfaces in the human mouth have
shown that salivary NO 3 - can be converted by oral
micro-organisms to NO 2 - , explaining the presence of
NO2- in addition to NO3- in saliva [17,18]. Detection of
NO in air incubated in the human mouth has led to the
hypothesis that bacterially-derived salivary NO2- is chemically reduced to NO in acidic microenvironments in
the oral cavity [18,19]. The underlying processes have
never been directly demonstrated because NO could not
be measured in dental biofilms over relevant spatial
scales. Therefore, other investigators considered NO2- in
human saliva a stable oxidation product of NO synthasederived NO that is produced by gingival cells to regulate
the gum immune and vascular systems [20,21].
Due to the possible formation of NO, plaque nitrogen
metabolism might be important to dental health. Dental
plaque causes periodontal diseases and dental caries,
affecting almost every human being [22,23]. As an
inflammatory disorder of gum tissue surrounding the
teeth, periodontal diseases might be especially affected
by nitrogen metabolism of dental plaque, if NO is generated as a side product at the gum-plaque interface.
NO plays a complex, but not well understood role in
periodontal diseases [24,25]. NO, at low concentrations,
is an important signalling molecule that coordinates
functions of immune system cells that are involved in
inflammatory processes [26]. Bacterial lipopolysaccharides stimulate production of proinflammatory cytokines,
which induce production of high, cytotoxic NO concentrations by certain immune system cells. Furthermore,
high NO levels during inflammation induce expression
of matrix metalloproteinases in neutrophiles, which
mediate soft tissue degradation [27].
Besides its potential importance to dental health, oral
nitrogen metabolism is important for human physiology
[8]. The formation of NO 2 - as a denitrification intermediate by oral micro-organisms leads to chemical conversion of NO2- to NO in the acidic stomach, acting as
an antimicrobial agent against pathogenic bacteria and
stimulating gastric blood flow. Moreover, NO 2 - is
absorbed into plasma, where it serves as a NO source

Page 2 of 11

for the regulation of vasodilatation under hypoxic conditions [8]. It is still unclear whether microbial nitrogen
metabolism in human dental plaque is significant in
comparison to other oral surfaces.
In the present study, we hypothesise that dental plaque represents a habitat for microbial denitrification in
humans, driving the biological conversion of salivary
NO3- to the denitrification intermediates NO and N2O,
and to the final product N2 . We use direct microbial
ecology methods, including a recently developed NO
microsensor [28], to demonstrate in situ NO formation
during denitrification in dental plaque and to show that
NO is formed at concentrations that are significant for
signalling to host tissue. In addition, we aim to show
the in vivo significance of plaque denitrification for the
formation of denitrification intermediates by correlating
the oral accumulation of N 2 O in humans to salivary
NO 3 - /NO 2 - concentrations and to the presence of
plaque.

Results
Dental plaque mediates aerobic denitrification

Dental plaque converted NO3- to N2 by denitrification.
This was shown by 30N2 formation from 15NO3- during
incubation of dispersed dental plaque (Figure 1a). The
occurrence of complete denitrification in dental biofilms
was corroborated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
detection of all genes (NO3- reductase, NO2- reductase,
NO reductase, N2O reductase) that are necessary for the
respiratory reduction of NO3- to N2 (Table 1). Genes for
respiratory NO reductases were restricted to the presence of the quinol-dependent type (qnorB), but not of
the cytochrome c-dependent type (cnorB).
Two lines of evidence suggested that denitrification in
dental biofilms occurred under aerobic conditions. First,
we observed 30N2 production from plaque that was suspended in air-saturated medium amended with 50 μM
15
NO3- (Figure 1a). O2 measurements in this medium
showed that aerobic heterotrophic respiration did not
lead to anoxic conditions during the incubation period
(Figure 1b). Second, microsensor measurements showed
that NO3- was consumed in the presence of O2 and that
also the denitrification intermediates NO and N2O were
formed in the presence of O2 (Figure 2a-d). At this low
NO3- concentration it is conceivable that all NO3- was
used for assimilation into biomass, and was thus not
available for respiratory denitrification. However, in this
plaque sample NO3- was not completely consumed (that
is, NO3- was not limiting) when present at a concentration of 50 μM NO3- (Figure 2a). Thus, NO3- assimilation and denitrification must have been already present
at their maximum capacity at 50 μM NO 3 - . Further
increases of the NO 3 - concentration to 760 μM will
most likely not change the contribution of both

individuals was suspended in aerobic mineral medium buffered at
pH 7.2 containing 2% sucrose and 50 μM Na15NO3. Formation of (a)

pathways to the total NO3- uptake. In turn, the biofilm
remained oxic when subjected to 760 μM NO 3 - and
produced the denitrification intermediates NO and N2O
(Figure 2f-h) indicating that aerobic denitrification was
also active at high NO3- concentrations.
Chemical and biological NO and N2O formation during
plaque denitrification is pH dependent

NO 3 - was the source for NO and N 2 O in dental biofilms. This was shown by NO and N2O formation being

restricted to the presence of NO 3- (Figure 2g, h). NO
formation in dental biofilms was mediated by both biological NO2- reduction and presumably acidic decomposition of NO2-. Biological NO2- reduction was the sole
process that produced NO when the medium was buffered at approximately pH 7. In non-buffered medium,
bacterial activity decreased biofilm pH < 5 (Figure 2e)
and depth-averaged NO concentrations increased from
0.08 to 0.15 μM (Figure 2g). Titration of 50 μM NO2- to
a buffer at pH 4.7 showed that acidic decomposition of
NO2- caused chemical formation of approximately 0.05
μM NO (Figure 3), which is in the same range than the
observed increase in the biofilm at pH < 5. It is already
known that plaque can form NO2- by NO3- reduction
[17]. NO 2 - can also naturally accumulate in saliva to
concentrations of 50 μM and higher (data not shown,
and [18]). Taken together, this suggests that acidic
decomposition of NO2- contributes to NO formation at
low plaque pH levels, while biological NO formation
may still occur in parallel.
The absolute increase of NO due to acidic conditions
was small from the perspective of the metabolic homeostasis of denitrification. This was evident because
depth-averaged increases of N 2 O, the product of NO
reduction, were approximately two orders of magnitude
higher than those of NO concentrations under acidic
conditions. This suggests that biofilm bacteria efficiently
convert most NO to N2O and thereby keep the steadystate concentration of cytotoxic NO low, as has been
also observed in environmental biofilms [13].
NO formation decreases O2 uptake of dental plaque

Oxygen uptake in the presence of NO3- was higher at
neutral pH than under acidic conditions (Figure 2e, f).
The O2 profiles showed that the flux of O2 decreased by
50%, namely from -105 nmol/cm2/h under buffered conditions to -43 nmol/cm2/h under non-buffered conditions. Acidic pH alone did not lead to reduced O 2
uptake when NO 3 - was absent, as the O 2 flux was

-143 nmol/cm2/h. Decreased bacterial O2 consumption
might result from direct toxic effects of the highest NO
concentration (0.15 to 0.2 μM), such as binding of NO
to terminal, respiratory O 2 reductases [29]. However,
the absolute increase from 0.08 to 0.2 μM may not
affect respiration as concentrations above 0.8 μM were
previously shown to be necessary to inhibit O2 reduction in Escherichia coli [30]. In addition, instead of facilitating O2 reduction, a small fraction of electrons might
be used preferentially for detoxification of NO by reduction to N2O, contributing to increased N2O concentrations and inhibited O2 uptake (Figure 2f, h).
Figure 3 Chemical formation of NO by acidic decomposition of
NO2-. NO formation was measured with a NO microsensor during
titration of increasing NO2- concentrations in different solutions of
phosphate-buffered saline at varying pH.

N2O production in the human mouth is dependent on
salivary NO3- and on the presence of dental plaque

We incubated air in the human mouth (’mouth air’) and
measured the rate of N2O accumulation to quantify the

Schreiber et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:24
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/24

in vivo significance of denitrification in the oral habitat.
We related N2O accumulation in mouth air to the presence of dental biofilms and salivary NO3-/NO2- concentrations (Figure 4). N2O accumulation in the presence of
dental plaque varied strongly between the subjects and
ranged from 11 to 443 nmol/h. N 2 O accumulation
between subjects increased with increasing salivary
NO3-/NO2- concentrations (Figure 4a). Drinking 200 ml
beetroot juice that contained 12 mmol/l NO3- increased
the salivary NO3-/NO2- concentrations, which led to an
increase of between 3.8 and 9.1 fold in the rate of oral
N2O accumulation.
Dental biofilms were the main sites of N2O production in the human mouth. This was evident because the
combined application of ordinary tooth brushing with
an antiseptic mouthwash decreased oral N2O accumulation rate by 82%, while tooth brushing alone decreased
the rate of oral N2O accumulation by 62% (Figure 4b).

Discussion
Our data show unambiguously that denitrification is a
relevant process in a human associated microbial community. Until now, it was assumed that complete NO3reduction in humans is restricted to the dissimilatory
nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), because most
bacterial isolates from humans are able to perform this
reaction [7,31]. DNRA is known to be a strictly anaerobic process that is favoured over denitrification in anaerobic, reduced environments [32]. Accordingly, DNRA
might prevail in the reduced, anaerobic environment of
the human gut, while denitrification is present in the
more oxidised dental plaque. In turn, it is conceivable
that DNRA is present in plaque that is recalcitrant to
removal and thus, constantly anoxic and more reduced.
Theoretically, in such biofilms NO2- reduction might be
coupled to the anaerobic oxidation of ammonium (anammox) (Figure 5, black dotted lines), especially if protein degradation of host tissue or DNRA could provide
a source for ammonium, as has been reported in marine
open water habitats [33]. Denitrification, however, might
be present in other oxidised environments in humans
where bacteria and NO3- co-occur. For example, NO3is also present in other body fluids than saliva that may
provide a rather oxidised environment (for example,
blood 20 to 40 μM and urine approximately 500 μM)
[8]. Thus, denitrification might be relevant in microbial
biofilms that are associated to other diseased or healthy
sites, such as cystic fibrosis lungs, otitis media ears,
implants, catheters and vaginal mucosa [34].
Denitrification and DNRA are fundamentally different
with respect to their final products, metabolic controls
and released intermediates resulting in different effects
on host physiology. Ammonium, the final product of
DNRA, is available to host cells and associated microbes

Page 5 of 11

as a form of fixed nitrogen. Moreover, DNRA in
humans may accumulate ammonium to detrimental
concentrations [35]. In contrast, N2, the final product of
denitrification, represents a loss of fixed nitrogen from
the host and does not affect human cells. Furthermore,
production of the signalling molecule NO by microbial
denitrification might shape the interactions between the
host cells and their associated microbial community.
Interestingly, denitrification in dental biofilms
occurred under aerobic conditions. This shows that dental plaque does not necessarily have to display anoxic
microsites for denitrification to occur. The ability to
denitrify in the presence of O 2 has been observed for
isolated bacterial strains and occasionally for microbial
communities [36,37]. Aerobic denitrification guarantees
a stable electron accepting process in a NO3--rich habitat exposed to frequent fluctuations in O2 concentration
without energy-demanding expression of new enzyme
systems [38]. This may perfectly apply to the oral habitat that is characterised by high salivary NO 3 - and
potentially fluctuating O2 concentrations in the mouth.
Despite the microbial diversity of dental biofilms [16],
we could only detect genes for respiratory NO reductases of the quinol-dependent type (qnorB), but not of
the cytochrome c-dependent type (cnorB). Interestingly,
genes that code for qNorB are also found in non-denitrifying, pathogenic bacteria, where it contributes to NO
detoxification, instead of respiratory electron transport
[39]. Apparently, respiratory NO reduction is exclusively
mediated by qNorB in the investigated dental biofilms.
Additionally, qNorB might be used as a protective
enzyme against toxic NO derived from host cells, acidic
decomposition of NO2- and other biofilm bacteria.
Our results allowed us to formulate a mechanistic
model for nitrogen conversions in dental plaque (Figure
5). First, reduction of salivary NO3- leads to the formation of NO2- [17], which is further denitrified to form
the intermediates NO and N2O and finally N2 (Figure 5,
green lines). The mechanistic model involves a pH-controlled chemical conversion step from NO2- to NO in
addition to the biological conversion step (Figure 5, red
line). The chemical conversion of NO2- to NO occurs if
acid fermentation decreases plaque pH < 5. High turnover of NO under acidic conditions leads to decreased
O 2 uptake in dental biofilms. This argues toward an
NO-mediated metabolic coupling of different microbial
activities in dental plaque. Moreover, bacteria respond
to NO as a signalling molecule. Specifically, NO is
involved in the dispersal of bacteria from biofilms [40].
Together this makes NO a possible bacterially-derived
factor that balances the development of a natural dental
plaque community. Thus, NO might be an important
factor from the perspective of the ‘ecological plaque
hypothesis’, which states that environmental factors (for

the rate of oral N2O accumulation of one individual on a certain day (black circles). Some volunteers were sampled on more than 1 day
resulting in 19 data points in total. Four volunteers were additionally sampled before and after drinking NO3--rich beetroot juice to increase
salivary NO2-/NO3- concentration and oral N2O accumulation (white circles connected by dotted line). (b) Effect of oral hygiene on N2O

tooth brushing (open circles, each of the six individuals is represented by a unique colour). For example, an individual (dark green) with an oral
N2O accumulation rate of 500 nmol/h reduced the rate to 290 nmol/h by tooth brushing. Subsequent application of a mouth rinse resulted in a
rate of 110 nmol/h. The dashed line corresponds to the absence of an effect of oral hygiene on the oral N2O accumulation. The error bars
indicate the standard error of five replicate measurements of the oral N2O accumulation rate.

example, pH and salivary NO3-) in the mouth determine
if the dental plaque microbial community is dominated
by either health-sustaining or disease-causing microorganisms [41].
Human cells can produce NO from arginine by NO
synthase activity and respond to NO as a signal

molecule produced by other cells [26]. In gingival tissue,
NO is known to be involved in blood pressure regulation and in inflammatory processes, such as those in
periodontal diseases [24,27]. Under acidic conditions,
the depth-averaged NO concentration in dental plaque
increased from 0.08 to 0.15 μM (Figure 2g), which is in

studies. Coloured lines show pathways that are suggested to occur by this study. Green lines show biologically-mediated pathways and red lines

a physiological effective range [42,43] for local blood
pressure regulation, neurosignalling events and immune
system modulation in tissues close to plaque. Hence, we
hypothesise that pH fluctuations and plaque denitrification may locally affect blood flow, signalling between
nerves, and inflammatory processes in the gum by modulating the concentration of NO (Figure 5, green line).
NO-mediated interactions will be different in cariogenic
as compared to periodontal plaque, because both are
characterised by distinct pH regimes [41]. While low pH
levels in cariogenic plaque may induce chemical NO formation leading to high NO concentrations, NO formation in periodontal plaque will be restricted to microbial
processes, because it is characterised by pH levels > 7.
As discussed above, microbial denitrification might be
relevant in other healthy and diseased sites of the body.
Thus more generally, microbial denitrification might be
considered an alternative route for NO formation in
humans and provides a basis for symbiotic interactions

between human-associated microbes and adjacent host
cells.
The presence of dental plaque caused accumulation of
N2O, as an intermediate of denitrification, in mouth air
depending on salivary NO 3 - concentrations. This
demonstrates that denitrification occurs in vivo and that
dietary NO3--uptake influences plaque denitrification.
The average rate of oral N2O emission from 15 volunteers with unbrushed teeth and non-manipulated salivary NO3-/NO2- concentrations was 80 nmol/h. While
earlier investigations of the breath air of human beings
revealed N2O concentrations above the ambient atmospheric level [44-46], our study presents the first oralassociated emission rates of this greenhouse gas [47] by
humans. Extrapolating our data to the world population
of currently 6.7 billion people, oral-associated N 2 O
emission by humans is 0.00013 Tg N/a, representing an
insignificant amount of 0.0008% of the total, annual
N2O emission of 16.4 Tg N/a to the atmosphere [48].

Dental biofilms were the main sites of N2O production in the human mouth. This result and the microsensor data strongly suggest that dental plaque is also the
main site for oral formation of the other denitrification
intermediates NO2- and NO. Thus, NO2- measurements
in saliva [20,21] are not an adequate proxy for NO formation by human host cells in the mouth (Figure 5).
Moreover, plaque denitrification needs to be considered
when using NO and NO2- measurements in breath and
saliva to diagnose systemic diseases, such as renal failure
[49,50] and cystic fibrosis [51]. More generally, the
importance of dental plaque for the formation of denitrification intermediates as compared to other oral surfaces indicates that plaque bacteria are as important for
oral nitrogen conversions than bacteria located on other
oral surfaces [17]. Consequently, dental biofilms and
salivary NO3- concentrations play a crucial role in the
regulation of body NO2- concentration and affect NO2-related physiological functions in the human body, such
as hypoxic vasodilatation and antimicrobial activity in
the acidic stomach (Figure 5, grey lines) [8].
Numerous anatomical sites, including the skin, mouth,
stomach, colon, and vagina, are inhabited by distinct
microbial communities, which are characterised by a
large diversity. This suggests a versatile potential of different metabolic pathways mediated by micro-organisms
that affect human physiology. However, activities or the
functional potentials of complex human-associated
microbial communities have rarely been investigated [1].
Thus, we anticipate that investigations of human-associated microbial communities with techniques that measure their in situ activities will lead to the discovery of
unexpected functions and interactions between microbes
and humans if expanded to elemental cycles of carbon,
sulfur, iron and others. The microbial ecology toolbox
available for these experiments comprises techniques,
such as microsensors, and isotopic or radioactive labelling with detection in bulk medium and on a single cell
level, all of which can be combined with phylogenetic
identification [52-55]. This ecophysiological approach
will allow the direct testing of hypotheses that emerge
from metagenomic data that is generated in the context
of the human microbiome project [56].

inflammatory disorders of gum tissue (that is, periodontal diseases). Microbial denitrification is, besides NO
synthase activity and acidic decomposition of NO2-, an
alternative pathway of NO formation in humans. Denitrification in dental plaque is a relevant site for production of intermediates of nitrogen cycling in the human
mouth and is dependent on salivary NO3-. Thus, breath
analysis for the detection of systemic diseases should
consider plaque activity, and denitrification in dental
plaque may affect the physiology of the whole human
body.

Conclusions
Human dental plaque mediates denitrification based on
salivary NO3-. Plaque denitrification is performed under
aerobic conditions and leads to biological and chemical
NO and N 2 O formation in a pH-dependent manner.
Plaque O2 uptake is inhibited by NO. Thus, formation
of NO mediates metabolic interactions between plaque
bacteria. Moreover, NO is produced at concentration
levels that allow signalling to human host cells, pointing
toward a significant role in the regulation of

Microsensor measurements

Methods
Samples

Samples of natural, dental plaque were obtained with
toothpicks or dental floss from male and female volunteers (25 to 52 years in age), who had not taken antibiotics, and not being diagnosed as having periodontitis
and/or other severe diseases. Experiments involving
human samples were approved by the Federal Dentists
Chamber Bremen (Landeszahnärztekammer Bremen,
Germany) and all volunteers gave their written consent.
N2 production from isotopically-labelled NO3-

Dental biofilms were collected with a toothpick from
dental surfaces and interproximal (IP) spaces of three
volunteers and were washed twice in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS; pH 7.2). The protein content of the sample
was determined after Lowry [57]. Biofilms were homogenised by vortexing, the material of each individual was
equally distributed to three exetainers (3.8 ml) and filled
with air saturated incubation medium (phosphate buffered saline and 2% sucrose). The incubation was immediately started by adding 50 μM Na 15 NO 3 and was
performed under continuous mixing at 37°C. Dissolved
O2 concentration was measured with an O2 microsensor, directly before biological reactions were stopped by
adding ZnCl2 to a final concentration of 0.5% at three
time points (t0 = 0 h; t1 = 3.5 h; t2 = 5 h). A quadrupole
mass spectrometer (GAM 200, IP Instruments, Bremen,
Germany) was used to measure 30N2 after introducing a
2 ml helium headspace into the closed exetainer and
equilibration between the liquid and gas phase.
Plaque from two volunteers was subjected to in situ
measurements with NO, N2O, O2, pH and NO3- microsensors outside the mouth. Biofilms were carefully
recovered with toothpicks or dental floss from the IP
spaces of the upper or lower molars by volunteers that
did not brush their teeth for at least 24 h. Whole biofilm pieces were placed on solid agar (1.5%), fixed with
a drop of molten agar (0.5%) and covered with non-buffered sucrose/salt medium (68 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgCl2,

Schreiber et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:24
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/24

3.6 mM CaCl 2 , 26.8 mM KCl, 2% sucrose; pH 6.6 to
7.2). Biofilms equilibrated for at least 20 min before the
measurements, which were performed within 6 to 8 h
after biofilm retrieval. Manufacturing of amperometric
NO, N 2 O and O 2 , and ion-selective pH and NO 3 microsensors [28,58-60] and microsensor measurements
[28] were conducted as previously described. Steady
state microprofiles were measured before and after 760
μM NaNO3 was added, while an air jet directed on the
medium surface created a constant flow regime above
the biofilm. To investigate nitrogen cycling at pH 6 to 7
in the biofilm the medium was supplemented with phosphate buffer (10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH
7.2; resembling the concentration in 1 × PBS), thereby
excluding chemical NO2- reduction. To increase sensor
performance, NO 3 - microprofiles were measured in
medium with lower salt content, and in the presence
and absence of 50 μM NaNO3, instead of 760 μM. All
presented measurements were performed in the same
biofilm spot. Thus, the measurements are suitable to
draw mechanistic conclusions. However, the data do not
account for biofilm heterogeneity and are not suitable
for calculation of average fluxes over a given biofilm
surface. We repeated the same experiment with a biofilm from a second individual, which essentially showed
the same treatment effects (see Additional file 1, Figure
S1 and supplementary discussion).
Molecular analysis of denitrification genes from
dental biofilms

Dental plaque was collected from dental surfaces and IP
spaces with sterile toothpicks by five volunteers that had
not brushed their teeth or eaten for 12 h. DNA was
extracted according to a protocol optimised for dental
plaque [61]. PCR amplification of partial sequences of
the denitrification genes narG, nirS, nirK, cnorB, qnorB,
and nosZ was performed in a total volume of 20 μl containing 2 μl of 10 × PCR buffer, 250 μM of each deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate, 1 U of Taq polymerase (5
Prime GmbH, Hamburg, Germany), 0.3 mg/ml bovine
serum albumin (BSA), 0.5 μM of each primer and 10 to
100 ng DNA. Published primers that target a wide spectrum of denitrification genes from different organisms
were used and PCR experiments were performed as
described in the corresponding protocols with some
modifications (Additional file 1, Table S1). Amplicons
were analysed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels and
subsequent ethidium bromide staining. For 11 out of 22
amplicons with the expected size clone libraries were
constructed and sequenced to confirm that PCR products corresponded to the targeted genes. Amplicons
were purified with the QIAQuick PCR purification kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and cloned using the TOPO
TA cloning system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)

following the manufacturer’s instructions. The obtained
sequences were analysed with BLAST http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov. Only 1 of the 11 clone libraries did not
contain the targeted gene (nirS, subject D).
N2O accumulation in mouth air

A total of 15 volunteers (25 to 52 years in age) were asked
not to brush their teeth the night and morning before the
measurement. They were allowed to eat and drink, but
not during the last hour before the measurements. To
exclusively measure N2O that is produced in the mouth,
but not in the lung or the stomach, we injected ambient
air (30 ml) into the empty mouth. Subsequently, volunteers were asked to breathe through the nose with the
mouth closed off from the nasopharynx and keep the
injected air in their mouth. We defined this air as mouth
air in which orally-produced N2O accumulated. Two gas
samples (1 ml) were withdrawn through the blunt canula
of a syringe after 30 and 90 s and filled into gas-tight exetainers (3 ml). This sampling scheme was repeated five
times with teeth unbrushed and five times with teeth
brushed by the volunteers. The N2O accumulation rate of
seven volunteers was additionally measured after both
teeth brushing and a 1-min antiseptic mouthwash that
contains chlorhexidine, following the package insert
(Chlorhexamed fluid, 0.1%, GlaxoSmithKline, Bühl, Germany). Before brushing the teeth, the volunteers collected
1 ml of saliva that was immediately frozen for later analysis of the NO3-/NO2- concentration. Subsamples of mouth
air were analysed for N2O concentration using a gas chromatograph with a 63Ni electron capture detector (Agilent
GC7890, Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany).
From the concentration difference between 30 and 90 s
and the incubated volume of air, the rate of N2O accumulation was calculated in nmol/individual/h. The increase of
N2O concentration in mouth air was shown to be linear
for at least 240 s in additional test runs.
In a separate experiment, the N2O accumulation rate
of four volunteers with teeth unbrushed was determined
before and 2 h after drinking 200 ml of beetroot juice
that contained 12 mM NO3-. The volunteers collected
0.5 ml of saliva before and then hourly after drinking
the beetroot juice for later analysis of the NO3-/NO2 concentration. Maximum salivary NO3- and NO2- concentrations were generally measured 2 h after drinking
beetroot juice. Saliva samples were cleared by centrifugation and then analysed for NO3-/NO2- with the VCl3
reduction method [62] followed by NO measurement on
a chemiluminescence detector (CLD 86, EcoPhysics,
Duernten, Switzerland).
