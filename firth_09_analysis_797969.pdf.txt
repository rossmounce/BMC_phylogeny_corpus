Abstract
The plant-infecting members of the genus Fijivirus (family Reoviridae) have linear dsRNA genomes
divided into 10 segments, two of which contain two substantial and non-overlapping ORFs, while
the remaining eight are apparently monocistronic. However, one of these – namely segment 5 –
contains a second long ORF (~200+ codons) that overlaps the 3' end of the major ORF (~920–940
codons) in the +1 reading frame. In this report, we use bioinformatic techniques to analyze the
pattern of base variations across an alignment of fijivirus segment 5 sequences, and show that this
3' ORF has a strong coding signature. Possible translation mechanisms for this unusually positioned
ORF are discussed.

Findings

The genus Fijivirus is one of ≥12 genera within the Reoviridae, a family of segmented dsRNA viruses. Fijiviruses have
10 segments, and infect plants and insects. Species such as
Fiji disease virus (FDV), Mal de Rio Cuarto virus (MRCV)
and Rice black streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) are transmitted by planthoppers and replicate in both the insect and
plant hosts, while the more distantly related Nilaparvata
lugens reovirus replicates only in insects. Reovirus segments
are predominantly monocistronic. However, two of the
plant fijivirus segments (S7 and S9 in RBSDV, homologous segments in other sequenced plant fijiviruses) contain two non-overlapping coding sequences (CDSs), each
pair separated by a short non-coding sequence [1,2]. One
other plant fijivirus segment (S5 in RBSDV) contains a
second substantial open reading frame or ORF (hereafter
ORF5-2; ~200+ codons), that overlaps the 3' end of the
'major' CDS (hereafter ORF5-1; ~920–940 codons) in the
+1 reading frame. The presence of this open reading frame
has been noted previously in RBSDV [3,4]. However, it

has often been ignored in the fijivirus literature; it is not
currently annotated in any of the three GenBank plant fijivirus RefSeqs; and its unusual genomic location means
that its coding status remains uncertain without further
analysis. In this short report, we present bioinformatic evidence that ORF5-2 is in fact coding, and initiates ≥365 nt
before the 3' end of ORF5-1 – thus implying that it utilizes
an unusual, as yet undefined, expression mechanism.
Fijivirus sequences in GenBank (9 Feb 2009) homologous
to RBSDV segment 5 were located by applying tblastn [5]
to the RBSDV segment 5 RefSeq [GenBank: NC_003736]
ORF5-1 amino acid sequence, resulting in the additional
sequences [GenBank: AY144569] – RBSDV segment 5,
[GenBank: NC_007160] – FDV segment 5, and [GenBank:
NC_008735] – MRCV segment 5. Note that the GenBank
RefSeqs NC_003736, NC_007160 and NC_008735 were
derived, respectively, from AJ409147, AY029521 and
AY607587.

If initiation is assumed to occur at the first in-frame AUG
codon then, in the RBSDV RefSeq [3], the two segment 5
ORFs have nucleotide coordinates 16–2826 (ORF5-1; 107
kDa) and 2378–3070 (ORF5-2; 26.7 kDa), so that ORF52 has 231 codons and overlaps the 3' end of ORF5-1 by
449 nt in the +1 reading frame. In the other RBSDV
sequence (AY144569; [4]), ORF5-1 has the same nucleotide coordinates (i.e. 16–2826), but the first suitable
AUG codon for ORF5-2 is 28 codons further 3', giving
ORF5-2 the maximal AUG-initiated nucleotide coordinates 2462–3070 (203 codons; 23.4 kDa; 365 nt overlap).
In MRCV [6], the maximal AUG-initiated nucleotide coordinates are 16–2811 (ORF5-1) and 2366–3130 (ORF5-2),
so that ORF5-2 has 255 codons and overlaps the 3' end of
ORF5-1 by 446 nt, again in the +1 reading frame.
In the FDV RefSeq, NC_007160, the two overlapping
ORFs have apparently been 'merged' into a single long
ORF [7]. However, in the expected overlap region, there is
a +1 frame overlapping ORF of up to 128 codons that has
high amino acid homology to the N-terminal half of
ORF5-2 in RBSDV and MRCV. Moreover, the C-terminal
~106 amino acid region of the annotated FDV ORF5-1 has
significant homology to the C-terminal half of ORF5-2 in
RBSDV and MRCV. This suggests that NC_007160 contains a deletion within or near to the region 2718–2746.
Whether this is a real feature of FDV, or whether
NC_007160 simply represents a 'defective' sequence, merits further investigation. For the analyses presented here,
however, an additional 'U' was arbitrarily inserted into a
run of five 'U's at the location 2714–2718 and, in this
case, ORF5-1 and ORF5-2 assume respective maximal
AUG-initiated nucleotide coordinates 59–2827 and
2448–3065, so that ORF5-2 has 206 codons and overlaps
the 3' end of ORF5-1 by 380 nt in the +1 reading frame.
(Note that our results do not depend on the FDV sequence
– if it is excluded from the analyses, we obtain essentially
the same results for the remaining fijivirus sequences.)
Overlapping CDSs are difficult to analyze with conventional gene-finding software [8]. The software package
MLOGD, however, was designed specifically for identifying and analyzing such CDSs, and includes explicit models for sequence evolution in multiply-coding regions
[8,9]. Using MLOGD, we recently identified – and subsequently experimentally verified – a new short CDS in the
Potyviridae family that overlaps the P3 cistron but is translated in the +2 reading frame [10]. When we applied
MLOGD to an alignment of the four fijivirus sequences,
MLOGD detected a strong coding signature for ORF5-2
(Figure 1). The number of independent base variations
across the alignment within the ORF5-2 region is Nvar ~
484, and the total MLOGD score is log(LR) ~88.9 (see [9]

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/32

for details). Extensive tests with known single-coding and
double-coding virus sequence alignments indicate that
'Nvar ≥ 20' and 'log(LR) ≥ 1 × Nvar' signals robust detec6
tion (<1% false positive rate) of an overlapping samestrand CDS [9] (and unpublished data).
The bottom panel of Figure 1 shows a representation of
the conservation at synonymous sites in ORF5-1. Beginning with pairwise sequence comparisons, conservation at
synonymous sites (only) was evaluated by comparing the
observed number of base substitutions with the number
expected under a neutral evolution model. The procedure
takes into account whether synonymous site codons are 1, 2-, 3-, 4- or 6-fold degenerate and the differing probabilities of transitions and transversions (full details are available on request from the authors). Statistics were then
summed over a phylogenetic tree as described in [9], and
averaged over a sliding window. Peaks in the conservation
at synonymous sites are generally indicative of functionally important overlapping elements – including overlapping CDSs – and it can be seen that the highest
conservation at synonymous sites in ORF5-1 corresponds
to the region where it overlaps ORF5-2.
Further, albeit indirect, evidence for the coding status of
ORF5-2 comes from an analysis of the 3'UTR lengths of
the 10 segments. In RBSDV, for example, the 3'UTR
lengths for segments 1–4 and 6–10 are 71, 86, 117, 74,
185, 81, 136, 111 and 103 nt. If ORF5-2 is not a CDS, then
segment 5 has an unusually long 3'UTR (335 nt). However, if ORF5-2 is coding, then the 3'UTR length (91 nt) is
within the range of 3' UTR lengths for the other 9 segments.
Since subgenomic RNAs are unknown in the Reoviridae
family, the genomic location of ORF5-2 rules out most
possible translation mechanisms. In NC_003736
(RBSDV), for example, ORF5-1 potentially begins at
AUG1 while ORF5-2 (if AUG-initiated) begins at AUG56
or later, thus precluding conventional leaky scanning
[11]. Reinitiation appears unlikely since, given the 5'extent of the positive MLOGD coding signal, it would
appear to necessitate backward scanning of ≥365 nt (cf.
[12]). Transcriptional slippage also appears unlikely as no
suitable slippage sites were found and, in contrast to the
paramyxovirus 'rule of six' [13], there is no obvious mechanism in the reoviruses for selective packaging of nonedited transcripts. Ribosomal +1 frameshifting from
ORF5-1 into ORF5-2 to produce a fusion protein (in competition with conventional translation of ORF5-1) is one
possibility [14]. A second possible mechanism is an IRES
– examples of which in other viruses can range from complex RNA secondary structures (which we were not able to
identify in fijivirus segment 5, in any convincing manner,

stop codons in each of the four sequences in each of the three forward reading frames (frame defined by alignment to the reference sequence [GenBank: NC_003736]). The FDV sequence has been put into the same frame as the other sequences via
the arbitrary insertion of an extra 'U' into the run of five 'U's at NC_007160 nucleotides 2714–2718, as discussed in the text.

(showing the likelihood ratio score for that window), and grey bars showing the width (ends) of the window. See [9] for further details of the MLOGD software. In (4) the null model, in each window, is that the sequence is non-coding, while the alternative model is that the sequence is coding in the +0 (i.e. ORF5-1) frame. Positive scores favour the alternative model and, as
expected, there is a strong coding signature throughout ORF5-1. In (5)-(6) the null model, in each window, is that only ORF51 is coding, while the alternative model is that both ORF5-1 and the window frame are coding. Scores are generally negative
with some scatter into low positive scores, except for the ORF5-2 region which has consecutive high-positively scoring windows (5). Note that the generally lower MLOGD signal within the overlap region itself (4)-(5), and also at the 5' end of ORF51 (4), is due to there being fewer substitutions with which to discrimate the null model from the alternative model in these
regions of above-average nucleotide conservation. (7) Map of the reference sequence [GenBank: NC_003736]. (8) Conservation at synonymous sites within ORF5-1 (see text and [18] for details). Note that the relatively large window size (75 codons)
– used here for improved statistical power – explains the broad smoothing of the conservation peak at the edges of the region
where ORF5-2 and ORF5-1 overlap.

with the available sequence data) to simple polypurine
tracts [15,16]. A third possible translation mechanism is
some sort of ribosomal shunting. Indeed in another Reoviridae species – Avian reovirus – a novel, as yet not fully
understood, scanning-independent ribosome migration
mechanism is used to bypass two upstream CDSs in order
to translate the 3'-proximal CDS on the tricistronic S1
mRNA [17].

A more detailed examination of sequence conservation
around the 5' end of ORF5-2 is shown in Figure 2. If
ORF5-2 is AUG-initiated, then the most plausible site
would appear to be at NC_003736 coordinates 2462–
2464, at which point all four sequences have a nearlyaligning AUG codon. However, the Kozak contexts of
these AUG codons are relatively poor. Furthermore, the
enhanced conservation at synonymous sites in the ORF51 reading frame commences around 14 codons further 5',
including the completely conserved motif 'U CUU UUC

Alignment extract showing the region around the 5' end of fijivirus ORF5-2. The high nucleotide conservation in
row 1 (mostly '*'s, only 2 'X's) can potentially be a result of amino acid constraints on the protein encoded by ORF5-1. In contrast, the high nucleotide conservation from the middle of row 3 to the end of the alignment extract is indicative of overlapping
features (many 'X's).

G' (ORF5-2 frame codons; or 'UCU UUU CG' in the
ORF5-1 frame) at NC_003736 coordinates 2419–2426. In
particular, there are two completely conserved ORF5-1
frame codons (UCU/Ser and CGA/Arg) at six-fold degenerate sites at NC_003736 coordinates 2419–2421 and
2437–2439. One possibility is that these conserved motifs
are involved in shunting, reinitiation or IRES activity to
allow ORF5-2 initiation at the downstream conserved
AUG codon. An alternative possibility is that these motifs
mediate +1 frameshifting from ORF5-1 into ORF5-2 so
that ORF5-2 is translated as part of a fusion product (~117
kDa in RBSDV).
Although much remains to be discovered about even the
known fijivirus proteins, it is important to be aware of the
full complement of encoded proteins as early as possible.
We hope that presentation of this bioinformatic analysis
will help fullfil that goal. Initial verification of ORF5-2
product could be by means of immunoblotting with
ORF5-2 specific antibodies, bearing in mind, however,
that it may be expressed at relatively low levels.
