Abstract
Background: Mycobacterium avium includes the subspecies avium, silvaticum, paratuberculosis and
hominissuis, and M. avium subspecies has been isolated from various environments all over the world
including from biofilms in water distribution systems. The aim of this study was to examine isolates
of M. avium subsp. avium and M. avium subsp. hominissuis of different origin for biofilm formation
and to look for correlations between biofilm formation and RFLP-types, and to standardise the
method to test for biofilm formation. In order to determine the best screening method, a panel of
14 isolates of M. avium subsp. avium and M. avium subsp. hominissuis, were tested for their ability to
form biofilm in microtiter plates under different conditions. Subsequently, 83 additional isolates
from humans, swine and birds were tested for biofilm formation. The isolates were tested for the
presence of selected genes involved in the synthesis of glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) in the cell wall of
M. avium, which is believed to be important for biofilm formation. Colony morphology and hsp65
sequvar were also determined.
Results: Nine isolates from swine produced biofilm. There was a significant higher frequency of
porcine isolates forming biofilm compared to human isolates. All isolates were previously
characterised by IS1311- and IS1245-RFLP typing. The ability to form biofilm did not correlate with
the RFLP-type, hsp65 sequevar, colony morphology or the presence of gene sequences related to
GPL synthesis.
Conclusion: The observed differences in biofilm forming abilities between porcine and human
isolates raises questions regarding the importance of biofilm formation for infectious potential. The
optimised method worked well for screening of multiple isolates.

Background
Mycobacterium avium includes the subspecies avium, silvaticum, paratuberculosis and hominissuis [1-3]. The former, M.
avium subsp. avium causes tuberculosis in captive and free
living birds [4], while M. avium subsp. hominissuis is an
opportunistic environmental pathogen for humans and
swine, and occasionally also for other mammals [1]. The
most common forms of disease in humans are pulmonary
disease, lymphadenitis and disseminated infection [5-7],
while swine usually develop localised lymph node lesions
[8]. Various molecular tools have been used to characterise isolates of M. avium, including restriction fragment
length polymorphism (RFLP) [9], sequencing of the hsp65
gene [10] and multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) [11].
In a previous study, we characterised M. avium isolates
from birds, swine and humans in Norway by IS1311- and
IS1245-RFLP typing. Our study demonstrated that transmission between animals and/or humans of identical isolates of M. avium is uncommon in Norway, and that
transmission of M. avium from the environment to
humans and animals is more likely [12]. The results are in
accordance with other studies [13-15].
M. avium has been found in soils and waters worldwide
[5], and isolates with identical RFLP-profiles have been
found in peat and human patients and in peat and swine,
respectively [16,17]. Drinking water has also been shown
to be a possible source of M. avium subsp. hominissuis for
both humans and swine [18-21]. M. avium has been
shown to survive in water for up to 26 months, and can
also survive within amoeba [22,23]. Additionally, potable
hot water systems may contain M. avium concentrations
greater than those found in cold water systems [24]. In
natural settings, bacteria on surfaces and interfaces are
found as multicellular aggregates, called biofilms [25]. M.
avium has been detected in naturally occurring biofilms in
water distribution systems, and has been shown to persist
in drinking water biofilms for weeks [20,26]. M. avium
may survive traditional water disinfection procedures
because it is naturally resistant to water treatment with
ozone and chlorine, and has been shown to be even more
resistant to chlorine treatment when grown in biofilm
[22,27,28]. Biofilms in drinking water systems may, therefore, be of importance as a reservoir for M. avium, and bacteria could be transmitted to humans and animals with
drinking water. Biofilm formation in M. avium has been
evaluated in vitro, and the ability to form biofilm varies
between isolates and under different growth conditions
[29,30]. So far, biofilm studies of M. avium have been performed with only a few human and environmental isolates, and biofilm studies of isolates from birds and swine
have, to the authors' knowledge, not been reported.
Glycopeptidolipids (GPLs), present in the outermost layer
of the cell wall of M. avium and M. smegmatis, seem to be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/159

of importance for biofilm formation in both species
[29,31-33]. The GPLs of M. avium can be divided into
non-serovar-specific (nsGPL) and serovars-specific GPL
(ssGPL) [34]. Whether different serovars have different
abilities to make GPL, is not known. Furthermore, GPLs
are associated with colony morphology, and M. avium colonies can be smooth opaque (SmO), smooth transparent
(SmT) or rough (Rg) [35,36]. The Rg variants of M. avium
have been shown to have alterations in their GPLs [37].
The aim of the present study was to screen a large number
of M. avium isolates of different origin for biofilm formation, and to correlate the ability to form biofilm with
RFLP-types (published previously [12]) and hsp65 sequevars of the isolates. In addition, we wanted to examine the
presence of some selected genes sequences in the GPL biosynthesis gene cluster to elucidate the importance of GPLs
for biofilm formation and colony morphology. To do
this, the biofilm screening method needed optimisation.

Methods
Eighty-eight Norwegian isolates of M. avium subspecies
hominissuis from human patients (n = 36), swine (n = 51)
and one bird and nine isolates M. avium subspecies avium
originating from wild birds were examined for their ability to form biofilm (Figure 1). The isolates have been
described previously [12]. In addition, the reference
strains M. avium ATCC 25291, R13 and M. avium 104 were
examined. M. smegmatis mc2 was included as a positive
control for biofilm formation.
Method optimisation
A panel of 14 M. avium subsp. hominissuis (seven from
humans, six from swine and one from a bird), and three
M. avium subsp. avium isolates originating from birds,
including the reference strains ATCC 25291 and R13, and
the positive control M. smegmatis mc2 were used during
optimisation of the method. The isolates all had a low
passage number.

Biofilm formation was determined as previously
described [30], but with some modifications. Isolates
were cultured in 10 ml Middlebrook 7H9 (BD Diagnostics, Sparks, MD) containing 10% oleic acid, albumin,
dextrose and catalase (BD Diagnostics), 0.1% Tween 80
(Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and 0.2% glycerin
(Merck) (7H9 with OADC and Tween). They were incubated with agitation (100/min) at 37°C for minimum
two weeks until they reached the stationary phase at
which point culture aliquots were frozen at -70°C. Subsequently, 100 μl of frozen stock culture was inoculated in
10 ml of fresh 7H9 with OADC and Tween and incubated
at 37°C with agitation for seven days. OD600 was measured, and the cultures were centrifuged and resuspended
to an OD600 of 0.2 in the different medias described

below. 200 μl of the cell suspension were added to the
wells of a 96-well flat bottom polystyrene microtiter plate
in triplicates (MicroWell™ Plates Nunclon™Δ no. 167008
(Nunc, Nuncleon, Roskilde, Denmark) [38], and incubated without agitation in a sealed container with 20 ml
sterile distilled water to prevent drying. Medium without
bacteria were used as negative controls on each plate.
After incubation for two or three weeks, bacterial growth
was determined by OD595 measurement. The wells were
washed once with 250 μl tap water, and the remaining
biofilm was stained using 250 μl 1% crystal violet (SigmaAldrich, St. Luis, MO), followed by 30 minutes incubation
at room temperature. The wells were rinsed three or four
times with tap water to remove unbound dye before the
stained biofilm was resuspended in 250 μl ethanol: acetone 70:30. Finally, the amount of biofilm was measured
at OD595. Results were presented as the median value of
the triplicates, subtracting the median value for the negative control.
The different media examined were: Middlebrook 7H9
with OADC and Tween, Middlebrook 7H9 without
OADC and Tween, a mixture of 50% sterile distilled water
and 50% Middlebrook 7H9 with OADC and Tween, sterile Hanks' Balanced Salt solution (Sigma-Aldrich), distilled water and sterile filtrated or autoclaved tap water
and lake water. Different temperatures; 37°C, 28°C and
20°C, and incubation time; two and three weeks, were
tested using Middlebrook 7H9 with OADC and Tween.

Distribution of biofilm producing Mycobacterium
avium isolates in a dendrogram based on the cluster

using both IS1311 and IS1245 as probes. A total of nine
isolates of M. avium subspecies avium and 88 isolates of M.
avium subsp. hominissuis isolated in Norway were included.
The RFLP dendrogram has been presented elsewhere [12],
but is has presently been combined with additional information regarding hsp65 code and the biofilm forming abilities of
the isolates. #1247 represents the identical profiles of nine
avian isolates, including #1553 and #1794. Biofilm forming
isolates have been highlighted in pink.

Screening of isolates
Based on the results from the method optimisation, Middlebrook 7H9 with OADC and Tween, and incubation for
two weeks at 20°C was selected to screen the 97 isolates,
and the reference strains R13, ATCC25291 and M. avium
104 for biofilm formation. Positive control, M. smegmatis
mc2 and negative control, Middlebrook 7H9 with OADC
and Tween, were included on each plate. All samples were
examined in triplicates. The amount of biofilm was determined as described above, with a slight modification.
Before staining, 250 μl methanol was used to wash the
wells before the plate was left to dry for 15 min. This
methanol fixation gave less variability between repeated
assays. Biofilm was stained with crystal violet as described
above.
Sequencing of hsp65
The hsp65 sequencing was performed as described by
Turenne et al [10]. Briefly, a 1059 bp fragment of the
hsp65 gene was amplified by PCR, and the product was
sequenced and analysed by BioEdit (Ibis Biosciences,
Carlsbad, CA). Isolates were assigned to hsp65 codes
based on the presence of single nucleotide polymor-

phisms (SNPs) compared to the reference strain M. avium
104.
Colony morphology
The colony morphology of all isolates was examined on
Middelbrook 7H10 (BD Diagnostics) medium after incubation at 37°C for two, three, four and five weeks. Colonies were described as smooth transparent (SmT), smoth
opaque (SmO) or rough (Rg) [35].
GPL biosynthesis genes
Primers for the GPL biosynthesis genes mdhtA, merA, mtfF
(called gsc by [39]), rtfA, mtfC and gtfA [39,40] were
designed using the programme Primer 3 http://
frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/. Primers and Genbank accession numbers for the various genes are listed in Table 1.
PCR reactions were performed with Taq DNA polymerase
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with the following PCR program: Initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, followed by
30 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 58°C for 30 sec and 72°C for
30 sec. PCR products were resolved by gel electrophoresis,
stained with ethidium bromide and visualised and captured under UV-light. All nine biofilm forming isolates
and nine isolates closely related to these based on RFLP
results [12], ten isolates harbouring ISMpa1 [12,41] and
13 other isolates were screened for the presence of the six
GPL biosynthesis genes. All together 42 isolates were
examined (27 isolates from swine, ten from humans and
five from birds including the reference strains ATCC
25291, R13 and M. avium 104).

without OADC and Tween both gave less biofilm formation. None of the isolates showed growth or formed biofilm when incubated in Hanks' balanced salt solution or
water from different sources, including distilled water,
sterile filtrated or autoclaved potable water and lake water
(results not shown). All temperatures and incubation
times tested gave good biofilm formation by the biofilm
positive isolates using 7H9 with OADC and Tween as
medium. The best results were obtained at 28°C and by
using three weeks of incubation. The trait of biofilm production was consistent between the isolates, and the nonbiofilm forming isolates were negative under all conditions (Figure 2).
Screening of isolates
Based on the results from the method optimisation, all 97
isolates plus reference strains were screened using 7H9
medium with OADC and Tween. For practical reasons
and in order to mimic environmental conditions, incubation at 20°C (room temperature) for two weeks was chosen. Nine of the 97 isolates formed biofilm; all were of
porcine origin and had average OD595 values ranging from
0.62 to 1.22 (Figure 3). The remaining isolates had OD595
values below 0.10 and were not regarded as biofilm forming isolates. Neither the ten bird isolates nor the 36
human isolates formed biofilm. The difference in biofilm
forming abilities of isolates from swine as opposed to isolates from humans was significant by the Fisher Exact Test
(p < 0.05). Isolates that formed biofilm belonged to nine
different RFLP profiles (Figure 1), and were not genetically
related based on RFLP typing.

Results
Method optimisation
Biofilm formation by the 17 isolates of M. avium with
respect to incubation time, temperature and media is
described in Figure 2. Only four isolates formed biofilm,
and the greatest amount of biofilm was obtained using
7H9 with OADC and Tween. A mixture of 50% sterile distilled water and 50% 7H9 with OADC and Tween or 7H9

Sequencing of hsp65 and colony morphology
Sequencing of the hsp65 gene to detect single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) was selected as a second method
to distinguish between isolates of M. avium. The method
was chosen as a complementary analysis in addition to
RFLP, because it targets a genetic element that is more stable than the IS elements, with a slower "molecular clock".

results are in accordance with other studies [37]. Amongst
the biofilm forming isolates, both SmT and SmO colonies
were observed, but none of these isolates had Rg colony

Seventy-two isolates were sequenced to determine the
hsp65 code, and the results are presented in Figure 1 and
Table 2. All the bird isolates (M. avium subsp. avium)
belonged to hsp65 code 4, and the human and porcine
isolates (M. avium subsp. hominissuis) belonged to hsp65
codes 1, 2 and 3. The biofilm forming isolates from swine
were either code 1 or code 3, but no correlation between
hsp65 code and ability to form biofilm could be detected.
All isolates, except one, were either SmT or SmO after two
weeks of incubation (Table 3). The reference strain ATCC
25291 was the only Rg isolate after two weeks. A few isolates had a combination of SmT and SmO colonies, and
one isolate (#1667) displayed a combination of SmO and
Rg colonies. After three, four and five weeks of incubation

GPL biosynthesis genes
The isolates were divided into three groups based on PCR
detection of the six genes (Table 4). Group I (14 isolates)
were positive for all genes examined (gtfA, rtfA, mtfC,
mdhtA, merA and mtfF). Four biofilm forming isolates and
all five isolates from birds (four M. avium subsp. avium
and one M. avium subsp. hominissuis), including the two
reference strains, belonged to this group. Group II consisted of 18 isolates negative for the ser2 cluster genes
mdhtA, merA and mtfF and positive for the nsGPL genes
gtfA, rtfA and mtfC. Four biofilm forming isolates
belonged to this group. One isolate from swine in this
group harboured ISMpa1 [41]. Group III (nine isolates)
were negative for all genes tested. All of these isolates harboured the ISMpa1- element [12,41], and one of them
(#1656) formed biofilm. Two isolates (#1591 and #
1655) had weak positive reactions to the mtfC-PCR.
Sequencing showed that they had a few basepair differences compared to AF125999/TMC724 (ATCC 25291).
The PCR product of #1591 was identical to the mtfC
sequence of M. avium 104. In the pairs of isolates with
similar or identical RFLP profiles where one formed biofilm and the other did not, five pairs had the same profile
of genes, while three pairs did not. The presence or
absence of these genes did not correlate with biofilm formation, as biofilm forming isolates were present in all
three groups.

Discussion
In this study, a method suitable for screening a large
number of M. avium isolates for biofilm formation was
established. Ninety-seven isolates of M. avium subsp.
avium and M. avium subsp. hominissuis originating from
birds, swine and humans were examined for their biofilm
forming abilities. To our knowledge, this is the first time a
large number of such isolates from different hosts have
been tested for biofilm formation. Nine isolates from
swine formed biofilm, none of the isolates from humans
or birds did. The optimised method was easy to perform,
can be adapted to other test-conditions and gave clear and
consistent results. A high and consistent biofilm-production was seen only when using Middlebrook 7H9, while
no biofilm was detected in water. Biofilm forming abilities did not correlate with RFLP-profile, hsp65 sequevar,
colony morphology or with the presence of the tested GPL
biosynthesis genes.
Water has been described as the best medium for evaluation of biofilm formation [30,42]. Williams et al used

autoclaved potable water for biofilm quantification by
CFU count and imaging [42], while Geier et al. used MQ
water [43]. However, our isolates did not make biofilm in
water, even though different types of water and water
from different sources like distilled, potable and lake
water was included. This discrepancy between earlier studies and the present study can be due to different isolates
tested or to other conditions in the experimental set-up.
Water is not a standardised medium, and the content of
ions, organic matter and the pH will vary depending on
local factors. Carter et al. demonstrated the effect of different ions and carbon sources on biofilm formation [30].
To test a medium containing different salts and glucose,
we tested our panel of isolates in Hanks's balanced salt
solution, which has been described as potential biofilm
media for M. avium [33,42]. However in our hands, none
of the isolates formed biofilm in Hanks'.
In the present study, few isolates formed biofilm. The testing is performed under laboratory conditions, and cannot
be directly transferred to bacterial behaviour in the envi-

ronment. Under natural conditions bacteria are part of
multispecies communities, and in nature it is possible
that any M. avium isolates can be found in biofilm, regardless of whether or not it shows the ability for biofilm production under laboratory conditions. To form a biofilm,
planctonic bacteria must first attach to a surface. Thereafter, they can organise into a biofilm, first as microcolonies
then as macrocolonies [44]. This organising of bacterial
cells is regulated by intraspecies and interspecies cell communication [45]. The autoinducer AI-2 is a universal quorum sensing signal used by many bacteria for interspecies
communication [45]. M. avium has been shown to
increase biofilm formation in response to AI-2, and to culture supernatant from a good biofilm producer [30,43].
We tested the ability to form biofilm in the laboratory
under given conditions, and under such conditions, bacteria may not form biofilm due to the absence of stimuli
from a microbial community.
Results from typing using IS1245- and IS1311-RFLP profiles and hsp65-sequevar did not correlate with the ability
to form biofilm. Even apparently genetically similar isolates, like # 1606 and # 1573 that had identical RFLP profiles, belonged to the same hsp65 sequevar and showed
identical results by PCRs for the GPL genes, had different
ability to form biofilm. Biofilm formation is probably a
complex process controlled by many different gene mechanisms. The RFLP method and other fingerprinting methods are suitable for epidemiological surveys and outbreak
investigations [46,47], while sequencing of the hsp65 gene
can be used to phylogenetic studies [48]. In the study of
complex mechanisms like biofilm and virulence, the correlation with these typing methods seemed limited.
It has been stated that GPLs are necessary for M. smegmatis
to form biofilm, and that GPL-deficient mutants do not
produce biofilm [31]. Similar findings are reported for M.
avium [29,33]. In a study performed by Krzywinska and
Schorey, the authors found differences between M. avium
strain A5 and strain 104 regarding the GPL biosynthesis
cluster. Strain 104 (serovar 1) lacks several genes belonging to the ser2 cluster (serovar 2) [39,40,49], while the
genes involved in synthesis of nsGPL are highly conserved

[39]. The biofilm producing abilities of these two strains
has been described in other studies, and strain 104 produced less biofilm than A5 [30,33]. To investigate the significance of genes in the GPL biosynthesis ser2 cluster for
the ability to form biofilm, the isolates were screened for
the presence of genes involved in the synthesis and modification of nsGPL, serovar 1 and serovar 2 [40,50,51]. The
isolates had three different patterns of GPL genes. Strains
with a similar organisation as M. avium 104 and A5 were
detected, but there was no association with biofilm formation. In addition one biofilm forming isolate lacked
the genes involved in the production of nsGPL. This isolate has previously been serotyped at our institute to be
serotype 10. It has been reported that serovars 5 and 10/
11 strains do not have the single Rha residue attached by
RtfA to 6-dTal, in contrast to all other serovars of M. avium
[34,52]. The GPL produced by this serotype is not well
characterised, but the presented results indicate that they
may be able to produce biofilm despite the apparent lack
of some genes involved in production of the most common nsGPL. As stated above, GPL has been associated
with biofilm forming abilities. In the present study, presence of the GPL genes tested was not correlated with biofilm formation, but an association might be due to
expression and not presence of the genes.
The significant differences in biofilm forming abilities
observed between porcine and human isolates are surprising since these isolates were very similar when tested for
other characteristics. Other studies have reported that isolates of human origin may form biofilm [30,33], so
although a significant difference in biofilm formation was
observed between human and porcine isolates of M.
avium subsp. hominissuis in the present study, this is not a
consistent difference. The ability to invade bronchial epithelial cells has been demonstrated to be impaired in biofilm deficient mutants of the M. avium strain A5, and the
same mutants had an impaired ability to cause infection
in mice [53]. It has thus been suggested that the ability of
an isolate to form biofilm is linked to virulence. Biofilm
forming isolates may also reach their hosts in large numbers if loosening in clusters from a naturally occurring
biofilm. The condition of the host may differ between
humans and swine. Human hosts are often immunocompromised or have predisposing lung conditions [6,54],
while porcine hosts probably are not. Swine rarely present
with clinical disease caused by M. avium subsp.hominissuis
[4]. It could be speculated that swine get infected only
when exposed to a large infective dose of the bacterium,
for instance originating from naturally occurring biofilms,
or that these biofilm related isolates are more virulent.
This may lead to a selection for biofilm forming isolates
in swine, explaining the differences observed in the
present study.

Conclusion
An optimised method to screen isolates of Mycobacterium
avium for biofilm formation was established, and this
method was used to examine 97 isolates retrieved from
humans, swine and birds. Nine isolates, all of porcine origin, formed biofilm. No correlation was found between
the ability of the isolates to form biofilm with the presence of selected GPL genes. The biofilm forming isolates
were not related by RFLP or hsp65 sequencing. The differences observed between the porcine and human isolates
raises questions regarding their biofilm forming abilities
and the importance of biofilm production for their infectious potential.
