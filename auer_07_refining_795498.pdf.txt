Abstract
Background: In an attempt to establish some consensus on the proper use and design of
experimental animal models in musculoskeletal research, AOVET (the veterinary specialty group
of the AO Foundation) in concert with the AO Research Institute (ARI), and the European
Academy for the Study of Scientific and Technological Advance, convened a group of
musculoskeletal researchers, veterinarians, legal experts, and ethicists to discuss, in a frank and
open forum, the use of animals in musculoskeletal research.
Methods: The group narrowed the field to fracture research. The consensus opinion resulting
from this workshop can be summarized as follows:
Results & Conclusion: Anaesthesia and pain management protocols for research animals should
follow standard protocols applied in clinical work for the species involved. This will improve
morbidity and mortality outcomes. A database should be established to facilitate selection of
anaesthesia and pain management protocols for specific experimental surgical procedures and
adopted as an International Standard (IS) according to animal species selected. A list of 10 golden
rules and requirements for conduction of animal experiments in musculoskeletal research was
drawn up comprising 1) Intelligent study designs to receive appropriate answers; 2) Minimal
complication rates (5 to max. 10%); 3) Defined end-points for both welfare and scientific outputs
analogous to quality assessment (QA) audit of protocols in GLP studies; 4) Sufficient details for

materials and methods applied; 5) Potentially confounding variables (genetic background, seasonal,
hormonal, size, histological, and biomechanical differences); 6) Post-operative management with
emphasis on analgesia and follow-up examinations; 7) Study protocols to satisfy criteria established
for a "justified animal study"; 8) Surgical expertise to conduct surgery on animals; 9) Pilot studies
as a critical part of model validation and powering of the definitive study design; 10) Criteria for
funding agencies to include requirements related to animal experiments as part of the overall
scientific proposal review protocols. Such agencies are also encouraged to seriously consider and
adopt the recommendations described here when awarding funds for specific projects. Specific new
requirements and mandates related both to improving the welfare and scientific rigour of animalbased research models are urgently needed as part of international harmonization of standards.

Background
As long as improving the human quality of life remains
the pre-eminent human ideal, animals will be susceptible
to exploitation further the human cause. This simple fact
is seen in the evolution of the agrarian civilization, animal
domestication, and more recently, in animal use for biomedical research. The remarkable recent developments in
human and animal genomics and subsequent explosion
in deliberate mutants (e.g., animal knock-outs and knockins) will only increase the intensity of animal model
development to benefit the human condition. Animal
rights and use in this regard depend upon the potential for
human benefit and justification for their exploitation. The
use of animal models in biomedical research has a long
and storied history. Indeed, the first recorded use of animals in research dates to the fourth century B.C. when
Aristotle studied the anatomical differences among various
animal species by dissecting them [1]. Since that time,
research using animals has produced significant advances
in all areas of medicine [1-6]. Several dedicated compendia describing relevant animal models in biomedical and
specific to orthopaedic research are available [7-14]. Significantly, as the limitations and inaccuracies inherent in
translating in vitro model results to in vivo equivalence
are more widely documented, the use of experimental animal models is likely to increase.
Central to the acceptance of animals as models of human
physiology and pathology is the belief that all animals are
so closely linked by the bonds of evolutionary and genetic
kinship that information gained from one mammalian
species is applicable to others [15]. However, when one
examines the vast heterogeneity that exists in the animal
kingdom, from gross anatomy to molecular levels, such a
generalization seems implausible. A more tempered concept was forwarded in 1929 by the distinguished Danish
physiologist, Krogh A, who wrote, "For a large number of
problems there will be some animal of choice, or a few
such animals, in which it can be most conveniently studied" [16]. This has become known as the "August Krogh
Principle" and has served as a rationale for the use of animal models in biomedical research. The issue then

reduces to which biomedical problems should use which
animals for appropriate studies, and what criteria should
be applied for such selection.
Although the long history of development and recognition of accepted animal models for the study of specific
biological phenomena supports the August krogh Principle, baseless or careless application of this principle often
leads to fallacious generalizations: 1) extrapolating experimental findings across species is not always valid [17]; 2)
Subtle variations in anatomy and physiology, gait (kinematic and kinetic profile), nutrition (e.g., ruminant versus
monogastric), age, and even reproductive cycles among
various species can greatly impact the response of a specific species to experimental manipulations of the musculoskeletal system. Thus, the researcher is frequently left
with the dilemma of which animal model(s) most accurately represent(s) and reproduce(s) the human condition
being investigated (if any), and to what extent the results
obtained from these models can be correctly and predictably extrapolated to humans. This scenario often
expressed in the literature is typified in a recent cartilage
repair animal study [18]:
"Although the repair of articular cartilage defects has
been studied in many species including rabbits, goats,
and sheep, there is no consensus on the most appropriate animal model....none of these species replicate
the anatomical, cellular, and biomechanical properties of the human knee. Therefore, we selected the
most closely related species, a nonhuman primate
(NHP), that may exhibit a healing response most similar to that of humans...."
Such dilemmas are frequently faced in the selection of
appropriate animal models for biomedical research. Relevance to human conditions varies widely.
As important as the purely scientific considerations in
selecting the appropriate animal model(s) for fracture
healing research are the compelling moral, ethical, and
legal issues associated with this decision. While humane

care and use of all research animals must remain central
to any scientific investigation involving living creatures,
less agreement exists world-wide as to universal rules, regulations, and oversight that should govern animal use in
biomedical research. Lastly, because of their high intrinsic
costs, animal experiments receive a large share of available
medically derived research funding. From the perspective
of "best use of funds" in an era of highly competitive
research funding, animal experiments should also be critically evaluated for their direct relevance, validity and
experimental value to the desired overall medical research
outcome. A simple cost-to-benefit ratio could be determined for animal models in research if metrics for validating appropriate use could be provided.
To achieve some limited consensus on these critical issues,
AOVET (the veterinary specialty group within the AO
Foundation), the AO Research Institute (ARI), and the
European Academy, sought consensus from a group of
musculoskeletal researchers, veterinarians, legal experts,
and ethicists from candid discussions on the bases for
appropriate use of animals in musculoskeletal research.
This document represents a consensus opinion from this
workshop, seeking to open a more active dialogue
amongst researchers with the clear goal to develop and
establish internationally accepted guidelines.
Defining a "justified animal study for fracture healing"
Few in vitro or non-mammalian surrogate experiments
accurately or adequately duplicate, or recapitulate the full
physiology of the animal model for fracture research purposes. Many research efforts seek new innovative
approaches to in vitro modelling of in vivo complexity
without clear progress or improved relevance. Use of animal models to study fracture healing under various stimuli and applied therapeutic methods is often an attempt to
most expediently duplicate conditions closest to the
human patient.

The "Medical Research Modernization Committee", an organisation of researchers who attributes part of the lack of
progress in medical research to the use of inappropriate
models makes the following statement, which may have
some merit: "Animal research advocates claim that animal
models can serve as reliable models of human conditions,
permitting invasive studies in "controlled" laboratory
environments. However this control is largely illusory,
because interspecies differences in anatomy and physiology, differences in cause and course between natural
human disease and artificially induced non-human
pathology, and stress experienced by animals in laboratories invariably alter research results." http://www.mrmc
med.org/ape.html This requires closer comparisons of the
value and accuracy of animal models in faithfully representing aspects of human conditions. Such comparison

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2474/8/72

should consider all aspects of the specific animal selected,
the problem under study, and the entire spectrum of consequences of applying the results to an equivalent human
condition.
Several bone and connective tissue human diseases do not
naturally occur in animals (e.g., osteoporosis appears to
be human-specific [19]) and if they do, such diseases
behave quite differently. In most cases, the disease or issue
to be investigated must be artificially and, importantly,
acutely induced in the normal, healthy animal that serves
as the model. Fracture modelling is more intuitive in this
regard; however, healing and fixation under compromised conditions (e.g., advanced age, diabetes, osteoporosis, infection) is less intuitive. Hence, reliably
producing a pathological or injury condition in an animal
that replicates human aspects of disease initiation and
propagation in the context of acute or chronic bone fracture healing is difficult. Similarities and analogues are better found for bone fixation or -healing, cartilage or spine
degeneration. However, most animals exhibit cell biology, histology, immunology and biochemistry distinct
from humans, different healing processes, unique complications, and non-equivalent tissue structures. Additionally, animal behaviour, therapeutic needs and connective
tissue healing responses (e.g., inflammation, soft and
skeletal tissue healing mechanisms and kinetics) also differ from those of humans. Lastly, usually healthy, normal,
robust animals are used to model or study bone fractures,
fixation models, disease and complications often clinically observed in unhealthy, aged or healing-compromised humans. These discrepancies with human reality
and treatment need to be better identified in descriptions
of the models applied where they compromise the validity
of the fracture research results.
Few generally accepted large-animal models for most
bone and joint studies of orthopaedic devices are
designed to replace clinical evaluation in humans. Many
effective animal studies show no direct correlation to
results in the most significant test – the human – and this
should be continually emphasised. Finally, humans live much
longer than most animals used for research. For fracture
healing as a function of age, animal studies are inadequate
to assess long-term infection risks and other long-term
complications. The criticism is relevant to cortical bone
graft research as well, because many of the same parameters "compatibility, durability, and toxicity" are involved
http://www.curedisease.com/Perspectives/vol_2_1990/
EvalBoneGraft.html. Fracture treatments are conducted in
animal models exhibiting different susceptibilities to
infection, intrinsic vascular histologies (e.g., the femur
and mandible are more highly vascularised than the fibula), biomechanics (e.g., quadrupeds versus bipeds),
wounding and healing histologies and responses, and

bone histomorphologies. Significantly, bone defects are
created in animals often without significant injury to surrounding nerves and blood vessels, and without loss of
surrounding soft tissue. A critical element of bone healing
in human traumatic bone fractures is the viability of such
soft tissue, particularly blood vessels, around the injury
site. This aspect, even though it is essential to understand
injury and healing phases, is often overlooked in these
model comparisons to human problems.
Orthopaedic researchers should begin again to articulate
appropriate selection criteria for animal models, clearly
focusing on how to most effectively translate basic
research elements, e.g., in vitro experiments, cadaveric
materials, computer models etc., into appropriate animal
models that most reliably translate to both human and
animal benefit [20]. This should lead to development of
universal hypotheses and compelling requirements to test
approaches experimentally only in animal models providing the highest scientifically relevant output directly
related to addressing the hypotheses and direct translation
to human benefit, with minimized animal detriment. Socalled "black box" investigations in which several research
variables are combined in "design-driven" or empirically
assessed animal experiments may serendipitously lead to
clinically interesting results, but they cannot provide
mechanistic insight or information relevant to biological,
physiological and biochemical understanding. If such
treatments fail or behave differently between different animal species and humans, developing a revised research
approach that attempts a hypothesis-driven experimental
pathway is difficult since few scientific hints or guiding
details are provided from the initial animal-based experimental designs. The classic scientific method demands
hypothesis-driven experimental design wherein proving a
null hypothesis (e.g., possibly a negative outcome) provides as much information for rational experimental redesign as a successful experiment. Approaching clinical
problems by considering all research possibilities in careful, scientifically validated ways should be essential. This
also includes candid presentation of negative results, typically remaining unpublished to date but, for animal
models, important for next-generation researchers in a
world-wide network, and for full compliance to animal
welfare and bioethics.
Anesthesia and pain management
Schuppli CA and FraserD [21], identified three key factors
that impede application of the three "R"s (Refine, Reduce,
Replace) recommended for animal model use [22]: 1)
incomplete understanding of the three "R"s (especially
"refinement"), 2) lack of consensus among ethics committee members on the nature and significance of animal
pain and suffering, and 3) lack of consensus as to whether
ethics committees should indeed follow a policy of mini-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2474/8/72

mizing overall harm to experimental animals [23].
"Refinement" is defined as techniques aiming to minimize animal pain, suffering and distress, such as informed
use of anaesthesia and post-operative analgesia to minimize post-surgical pain and distress. Competent anaesthetic and analgesic management, appropriate to the
scientific objectives of the fracture models, are clearly integral to the aims of refinement in animal research.
Anaesthesia protocols
This relatively sophisticated and advanced area of animal
welfare management is often under-appreciated. Anaesthesia protocols best suited for each species should be
applied, requiring profound knowledge and specialization in this field. Consequently, animal anaesthetic and
analgesic protocols should at least be approved and supervised, if not conducted by an experienced and researchqualified veterinary anaesthesiologist or anaesthetist. Laboratory animal models (mice, rats, rabbits) should enrol a
thoroughly trained laboratory specialist. As the number of
such specialists is presently relatively low, specialty colleges and laboratory experts should attempt to train veterinarians and scientists interested in this field to fill this
important void. Given the potential adverse impact of
inadequate or inappropriate anaesthetic and analgesic
management on animal recovery, fracture healing and
animal welfare, future anaesthetic and pain management
protocols used in experimental studies should be required
to provide full details in the "materials and methods" section of all publications.
Pain management
Pre-requisites for adequate pain management in experimental animals are: 1) sound knowledge of pain pathophysiology, 2) sound knowledge of pharmacological/
non-pharmacological analgesic strategies, and 3) the ability to identify and evaluate pain in specific species and
individual animals.
Sound knowledge of pain pathophysiology
Poorly managed pain has many adverse consequences
that subsequently impact the validity and success of musculoskeletal research projects, and is known to significantly increase intra- and post- operative morbidity and
mortality. Researchers must be familiar with the basic
anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology and modulation
of nociceptive transmission, including key concepts of
peripheral and central sensitisation, multi-modal analgesia, and pre-emptive analgesia. These are summarized in
the International Association for the Study of Pain core
curriculum for Professional Education in Pain [23].

BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders 2007, 8:72

Sound knowledge and application of pre-emptive and multi-modal
analgesic strategies
Consistent with multi-modal analgesia, any potentially
painful surgical procedure should consider inclusion of
all classes of analgesic agents: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAID's), opioids, NMDA antagonists
(e.g., ketamine), membrane stabilising agents (local
anaesthetics), and α2 agonists. Potential direct and indirect effects of each class of analgesic agents on the biological mechanisms under investigation should also be
considered. Concerns have been raised about the potential adverse effects of NSAID's on bone healing and
metabolism related to signal transduction of pro-inflammatory and related cell signalling cascades.

The pharmacokinetic profile, efficacy and safety of analgesic drugs vary widely between species. Thus, researchers
planning animal analgesic programs must be familiar
with literature relevant to the experimental species used.
Researchers are encouraged to consult sources of information related to rodent and lagomorph anesthesia and pain
management for guidelines relating to each species http:/
/altweb.jhsph.edu/pain.htm[24,25]. Further research is
required to define and improve safe and efficacious analgesic regimes for certain species used in musculoskeletal
research (e.g., sheep and rabbits), as the current paucity of
pre-clinical and clinical data precludes optimal use of all
analgesic strategies currently in use in humans and other
animal species.
As analgesic agents are administered to animals by various
routes, a combination of systemic and other routes should
be considered when planning an analgesic strategy for a
particular experimental procedure. Researchers should be
familiar with implementing all potential routes of analgesic administration.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2474/8/72

information when consistently applied by trained, experienced observers intimately familiar with the animals
being assessed, their very subjectivity makes them unreliable when used by multiple or poorly experienced observers. Subjective scales used in pain assessment of sheep
used in musculoskeletal research have been published
[26,27]. Measurement of "objective" physiological variables such as heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure,
humoral factors including plasma cortisol or endorphin
levels, as well as pupil diameter have been shown to be
inconsistent and insensitive indicators of pain severity in
animals. Systems such as the Glasgow Pain Scale [28], and
the University of Melbourne Pain Scale[29] have been
developed and thoroughly validated in dogs. No such
multidimensional systems have been developed to date
for evaluation of pain in experimental laboratory animal
species.
Objective pain assessment systems have been developed
for certain animal species (dogs, laboratory rats
[25,30,31], horses [32], and lambs [33]). Further studies
are clearly indicated to define and improve validated, sensitive methods for evaluating pain severity in all research
animal species. Procedure-specific, objective, behaviourbased pain assessment systems require development and
implementation in species used in musculoskeletal
research. Researchers are encouraged to consult information on this subject available on the world-wide web. Further research should critically evaluate all information
available and define valid and sensitive methods for evaluating pain severity in all animal species used in research.

Ability to identify and evaluate pain in specific species and individual
animals
No "gold standard" exists for measuring or assessing animal pain. It is well-recognised that species, gender, age,
breed, environment and various stressors influence pain
behaviour. It has been generally recognized that the greatest gap in our knowledge of animal pain is the lack of
assessment tools.

Considerations for establishing standards in surgical,
biological and mechanical aspects of in vivo models for
research in mechano-regulation of bone repair
Bone, both as a material and structural organ, is acutely
responsive to changes in both the biological and mechanical environments. The specific architecture of individual
bones is attained as a consequence of a combination of a
genetically determined template and prevailing mechanical demands. The base structure of the cortex in dogs (and
humans) is composed of secondary osteones, whereas
sheep cortex comprises predominantly lamellar bone.
However, during bone healing and remodeling, secondary osteones are activated in all these species.

Peri-operative pain must be assessed frequently by
trained, experienced observers who are intimately familiar
both with the species, the specific surgical intervention
and, ideally, with the individual animals used in the
study. The most frequently used subjective scoring systems used for evaluation of animal pain include visual
analogue scales, simple descriptive scales, numerical rating scales, and verbal rating or ordinal scales, all of which
have inherent limitations. While they can provide useful

The long-standing law of skeletal structural optimization
"Wolff's Law" arose from observations that, as a structure,
bone actively adjusts both mass and architecture in relation to the magnitude and direction of applied loads [34].
However, both animals and human individuals have very
different base levels of bone mass. Thus, the genotype may
influence the specific structural and material features:
material properties, for example, may differ by as much as
200% in different laboratory mice strains, related to struc-

tural morphology [35]. Furthermore, these differences
may be compounded by additional genotype-related
responses to mechanical stimuli. This has been demonstrated elegantly in work by Judex S, et al. [36]. Continual
deformation of bone incurred with loading, as a result of
both gravitational forces and muscle action associated
with everyday activities, has traditionally been thought to
result in micro-damage to the bone matrix. This is seen as
micro-cracking. Micro-cracks within bone as a material
normally initiate a remodeling process that results in
repair through secondary osteonal bone formation [37].
Levels of micro-cracking increase with increasing mechanical demand over a short time course. Increase in mechanical demand over an appropriate time course will initiate
structural adaptation. Recent work indicates that this generalization is questionable and some genotypes are
"responders" to changes in loading and consequent adaptation, whereas others are not [36].
Gross fracture of bone can occur through either accumulation of fatigue damage or as a consequence of monotonic failure. The repair processes of bone as a structure are
modulated through the prevailing mechanical environment. Two basic patterns of repair occur and are dependent upon the level of inter-fragmentary stability. A high
level of inter-fragmentary stability as a consequence of
rigid fixation induces direct bone repair. This involves
osteonal remodeling across the fracture line where fragments are in direct contact and woven bone formation
within gaps. Minimal callus formation occurs; the healing
process takes place over a long time period. This type of
healing is typically achieved with rigid internal fixation
devices such as plates. In contrast, where the fragments are
stabilized with less rigid fixation, typically external fixation, intramedullary nailing, braces and casts, repair
occurs through indirect bone repair, mediated through
formation of periosteal and endosteal bridging callus and
differentiation of the early fracture hematoma. The rate of
repair in terms of the distribution of callus and rate of tissue differentiation is acutely sensitive to the specific
mechanical environment at the fracture site. Biological
factors, including effects of drugs used for control of
inflammation and pain may also modulate the repair
process. In intact bone, the pathway for mechano-transduction has been shown to involve the estrogen receptor
[38]. Additionally it is known that hormone levels may
also modulate bone healing [39]. In research related to
mechanisms involved in progression of bone repair, the
specific hypotheses may, for example, relate to the biological cascade involved with osteogenesis, or may be more
aligned to understanding the mechanics of the fixation
device or indeed both. Models that investigate fundamental molecular mechanisms might best use rodent (e.g.,
murine) species for which the most comprehensive full
portfolio of molecular and genetic probes, cell lines, and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2474/8/72

genetic knock-out/knock-in animals are available. In contrast, for biomechanical studies or those related to biotechnology (e.g., biomaterials) and functional outcomes,
a large animal model provides the ability to evaluate
devices used in humans more realistically.
The role of in vivo models in bone repair research
As indicated above, the entire animal experimental system
remains an essential biomedical research component that
to date, despite many efforts to find effective surrogate
models, is not supplanted in fracture healing research scenarios with non-animal substitutes. Continuous support
for the principle of the three R's, veterinary and human
clinical caseloads (e.g., spontaneously presenting cases)
can be used together as models to advance our understanding and treatment of some fracture healing issues on
a comparative basis to benefit both animals and humans.
The lack of standardization represents a disadvantage in
this strategy. Therefore, induced animal models are also
required to test specific hypotheses with scientifically validated criteria for their selection. In addition, methods for
data assessment and analysis should aim to minimize
confounding variables (see below). The ability to relate
data to those from other studies may also be compromised by the use of different models or even the same
model used in a different environment. Standardization is
therefore critical in maximising the cost benefit of in vivo
models.
Confounding variables
Fracture research is a relatively small field within all biomedical research, yet the range of models used is perhaps
the most diverse. These models vary even within species in
terms of the anatomical site used, the husbandry conditions, the genotype (breed or strain), gender, characterization and type of fixation device, and duration of the
healing period. The ability to compare data across
cohorts, investigators, and species is often facilitated by
the use of standard assays and standardized test systems
commonly exploited in different laboratories: without
common methods and accepted standards, quantitative
comparisons are impossible. However, to a large extent,
current in vivo models used to study bone repair are laboratory-specific, and full description of investigator-recognized features of experimental design and outcomes that
can influence the repair processes may not be presented or
indeed known. Hence, an important opportunity avails
itself to seek consensus on putative international standards that would provide enabling technology for multisite collaborative studies and direct data comparisons in
animal-based bone-healing models.

The age of different species likely impacts the physiological pattern and rate of healing [40], but due to the expense
of using geriatric animal models (e.g., inbred research-

BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders 2007, 8:72

quality young rabbits cost roughly one-tenth of 2-year old
rabbits), little is really known about this important variable well-known in humans to profoundly affect healing.
Different anatomical sites may also influence the pattern
of repair; this is multi-factorial, partly because of the
unique mechano-biology of different skeletal bones and
partly as a consequence of biological differences per se. For
example the metacarpal/metatarsal bones of small ruminants are fused bones (McIII/IV; MtIII/IV) with minimal
soft tissue coverage. Tendons and ligaments are found on
the dorsal and palmar/plantar aspects of this bone. The
tibia presents a bone anatomy providing a subcutaneous
surface craniomedially and muscle cover laterocaudally.
By contrast, the femur is predominantly covered by muscle on all aspects. Within specific bones healing may also
differ at sites, with predominantly cortical healing at diaphyseal sites, and cancellous healing at metaphyseal sites.
The extent of cancellous bone also differs between species
and is generally limited in relation to the extent seen in
humans.
A further consideration involves size-scale physiological
disparities between animals and humans [41], and possible effects on bone neogenesis and fracture healing mechanisms. Experimentally studied critical size bone defects
[42] demonstrate a species-dependent healing. A 4-mm
circular craniomandibular bone defect in mice and 8-mm
defect in rats are often both non-healing without therapeutic intervention at 12–24 weeks. However, a 8-mm
diameter defect in a larger animal model (e.g., rabbit, dog,
sheep) will heal spontaneously since the surrounding soft
tissue and remaining perimeter bone interfacial area are
better able to supply signals and regenerative milieu to
this relatively smaller defect volume. Critical size calvarial
defects increase to 17–35 mm diameters in larger animals
(guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, sheep). The linear dimensions
of a "critical" defect in bone do not seemingly translate
simply across models, nor to humans, nor across different
bone defect sites (e.g., cranial to long bone). Additionally,
the anatomical site of a critical defect has an effect on its
size and therefore possible nutrient transport limitations
to heal. For example, an 8 mm-diameter circular defect in
rat parietal bones will heal spontaneously, whereas an 8
mm-diameter circular defect in human parietal bone will
not. These wound site transport scaling effects also have
profound impact on the delivery of exogenous therapeutic
and biotechnology components (living cells, growth factors, drugs) to fracture or defect sites. One last consideration here is the problem of the likelihood of surrounding
soft tissue prolapse into the bone wound site as a function
of increasing size. This might be more profound in the
human than in smaller mammalian models, hindering
healing. Lastly, a common issue relevant to all animal
bone models regards the varying degrees of bone wound
repair capability observed phylogenetically, specifically

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2474/8/72

the empirically observed compromised ability of spontaneous bone wound healing in higher order species compared to lower phylogenies [43]. This effect extends
beyond mammalian species in larger-sized bone wounds
relative to wound size: relatively larger bone volumes will
regenerate in rodents and amphibians (e.g., newt) compared to higher mammalian species. This further infers
that reservoirs of undifferentiated progenitor cells in
rodents are perhaps more potent and responsive and
quantitatively superior to humans in bone regeneration.
Surgical approaches and the anatomical positioning of
the fixation device, the mechanical characteristics of the
device and the activity of the animal can all influence the
local mechanical environment at the fracture site. Very
small differences in mechanical conditions, especially in
the early stages of healing (e.g., restricted housing or
mobility), can produce statistically significant differences
in both rate and patterns of repair. The method of creating
a fracture or osteotomy also varies between models. In the
Einhorn model in rodents [44], fractures are induced by
blunt trauma, using a controlled weight drop as a noninvasive system, and fixation uses an intramedullary
device. In other models [45-48], an open surgical osteotomy or drill hole defect is made. Thus, different levels of
soft tissue compromise occur, providing different subsequent effects on bone repair processes [49]. Each animal's
hormonal and possibly nutritional status can also influence the bone healing process. Hence, little commonality
is observed in the literature to date with regard to fracture
models along many different variables, and therefore, little meaningful comparison can be made, even between
similar species, if standards are not recognized that unite
all of these model features.
As part of both ethical and scientific requirements for
improving model value to the orthopaedic surgical community, this wide variety of models could be rationalized
and refined to provide the basis for developing standards
against which specific interventions could be compared
directly.
Fracture model standardization
Advances in the field of mechanobiology in bone repair
could be enhanced through a common consensus for
standard animal models for bone healing, fixation techniques, outcome measures and standard comparison metrics. Major research centres involved in this field of
research should move to adopt uniform international
standards to refine existing models and adopt common
usage decision trees, classifications and rationales. This
will lead to an overall reduction in numbers of animals
used, and concomitant increase in the research impact per
animal sacrificed. Data generated from standardized
models should also contribute more rapidly to the devel-

opment of computer modelling to better predict biological processes and thus eventually replace some in vivo
models.
Funding agencies are strongly encouraged to insist on
access to specialist anaesthetists and veterinary surgeons
qualified to help identity and use specific models and animal species for specific purposes. They are also encouraged to seriously consider the positions stated in this
paper as a basis for quality, outcome accuracy and excellence when awarding funds for specific bone repair
research projects.
A consensus related to in vivo fracture models studied for
specific purposes is required to establish standards for
comparative purposes. It seems appropriate (and traditionally consistent) to adapt a large animal model for
device and biomechanical tests, and rodent models for
molecular mechanisms and molecular genetics of bone
healing and repair. Agreement is needed and should be
sought in relation to animal species, breed, gender, age
and reproductive state where appropriate, and husbandry
regimens. Surgical procedures should be standardized to
follow state-of-the-art aseptic techniques where possible
using jigs and guides to locate the osteotomy/fracture at a
precise position and in relation to anatomical landmarks.
Osteotomy/fracture gaps also need to be constant in a
standard model, where a standard caliper can be applied.
This has not been consistently followed or reported in the
literature.
Mechanical influences on bone repair are increasingly
studied at a molecular and genetic level as well. Fixation
systems should allow stiffness to be both controlled and
determined, since even small differences in fixator stiffness influence healing significantly [50]. Some limited
control of the mechanical environment in rodent models
can be achieved by standardization and fixation system
stiffness [45]. Harrison LJ, et al. used an external fixation
system in a rodent model to standardize fixation stiffness,
also allowing a standard plane of section to be taken [51].
This system was used to determine distribution of tissues
in the standard section. Such sample analysis also requires
careful consideration of methods used, as facture healing
results in a heterogeneous distribution of tissue, and
therefore standardization of positions of sections and tissue samples should be evaluated and tracked carefully.
Animal physical activity levels should also be considered
and quantified where possible, as these also modulate the
bone repair process [52]. Hence, therapeutic movement
and activity needs in different animals and models should
be reconsidered. In vivo and postmortem assessments
should also require a standard approach, for example the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2474/8/72

use of jigs and guides for obtaining standard view radiographs, DXA and pQCT scans.
Mechanical testing for fracture stiffness and strength again
would be optimized if accepted standardized tests were
consistently used. At present, various systems for threeand four- point bending and/or torsion as either destructive or non-destructive tests are used.
Standardized biological assessments may be made from
histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry. If so, the
plane-of-section in relation to the callus must be constant
and specified. The standard sampling system must also
apply to tissues used for gene expression determinations
and protein evaluations. In each model, assessment time
points should be part of the agreed standard.
Study design
As part of assuring consistent application of the three "R's"
approach, larger experimental studies should only be
designed after reviewing results from an appropriate pilot
study or as a follow-up to previous studies. Proper factorial analyses and statistical determinations (e.g., standard
deviations, power analyses) would allow justification of
cohort designs, to produce a greater confidence in study
outcome, with the objective of reducing animal numbers
needed for research. Additionally, milestones and deliverables must be clearly declared in the research proposal,
and animal study designs articulated to reach these milestones. Optimal study design includes maximal appropriate exploitation of research animals while simultaneously
maintaining their well-being as a priority. Multiple use of
animals or bilateral fracture (osteotomy) management
must be avoided for welfare reasons, as well as the negative overall influence of abnormal animal weight bearing
during the healing phase, distinct from the true humanrelevant clinical situation.
Surgical expertise and technique
Just as important as having anaesthetic protocols conducted by experienced veterinary anaesthesiologists or
laboratory animal specialists is the expertise of the animal
surgeon. Animal surgeries should not be performed by
human surgeons not entirely familiar with the detailed
anatomy and physiology of the species they use for their
experiments. This often leads to post-operative complications resulting in unacceptably high losses of animals that
are not declared in publications – these animals lose their
lives for nothing and go unnoticed and unreported! Especially in fracture treatment studies using surgical implants
in large animals, the known risks of post-operative catastrophic failure must be weighed carefully in the model
selection. Complication rates should not exceed 5% and
should be fully disclosed in all publications so that future

Page 8 of 13

BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders 2007, 8:72

studies can be designed to reduce complications and
refine models on an evidence basis.
Two authors (Auer JA, von Rechenberg B) too often had to
make the unfortunate observation that some human surgeons appear to lack compassion for their research animals, which may indirectly and inadvertently produce
increased animal suffering. This leads to the logical
demand that future research studies in fracture management be conducted only by surgeons with appropriate
surgical and research training in relevant animal models,
and capabilities to discern model differences for model
selection and follow-through.
Post-operative animal management and evaluation
Personnel
The labour associated with managing experimental animal during a study increases proportionally with the size
of the animal used. Therefore, an adequate number of
qualified staff with clearly defined responsibilities and
management structures is important for effective postoperative management especially in large animal models.
These personnel are responsible for adequate record-keeping, administering medication, animal surveillance and
maintaining optimal hygiene and animal welfare conditions. Applying Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) guidelines is useful for structuring personnel, data reporting,
quality management, and ensuring clear lines of responsibilities and hierarchy.
Pre-operative animal acclimatisation
Pre-operative clinical assessment and acclimatisation is an
essential component of successful post-operative management. Subject animals should be accustomed to human
contact, the housing facility, and any particular post-operative interventions or treatments. One week has been recommended as a minimum acclimatisation period for
ensuring that baseline physiological data may be established [53], but longer (e.g., 3–4 weeks) may be more sensible to ensure that the animals are accustomed to their
environment, the facility routines and the personnel.
Additionally, during this time, the animal should be thoroughly checked for potential health problems or abnormal behaviour, and triaged if necessary. In the case of
sheep, goats, pigs and calves, claws should be inspected
and evenly trimmed. The animals should be offered a balanced diet during the entire investigative period and initially subjected to effective antiparasitic management.
Medications
As mentioned above, carefully selected and administered
analgesic medications for postoperative management are
indicated. Some researchers feel that in a purpose-built
facility, and with appropriate aseptic technique, antibiotics are not necessary, although this may depend on the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2474/8/72

animal species. The benefit of this approach is that complex interactions between antibiotics and other drugs,
with the wound healing process, need not be considered,
and problems associated with antibiotic-resistant bacteria
are avoided. Other researchers feel that therapeutic doses
of broad-spectrum antibiotics are indicated peri-operatively. Their reasoning is that these drugs do not interfere
with bone healing, reduce morbidity and aid in reducing
animal loss.
Post-operative animal housing
In the immediate post-operative period (4–6 hours), animal subjects should be housed in a closely monitored
environment protected from adverse climatic conditions
and other stressors including people and other research
animals. This is best achieved in modern, purpose-built
housing for which guidelines have been established in
some countries ([54]. Accessed October, 2006). Some
additional design components regarding post-operative
housing of large research animals (sheep, goats, pigs,
calves) used in fracture research include using individual
pens fitted with heat lamps and surveillance cameras.

A contentious issue is the use of supportive slings or harnesses in small ruminants (Fig. 1). These devices, if correctly fitted, do not decrease load-bearing while the
animals stand, but they prevent the animal from becoming recumbent or bolting suddenly, and therefore avoid
peak torques and loads experienced in limbs. The optimal
duration for harness use depends on the type of fracture/
defect and repair. The harness or sling should allow movement and rotation of the animal within its stall or box and
at least nose and sight contact between individual animals. However, even for the same type of surgery, the optimal duration is unclear. Some researchers favour use only
in the immediate postoperative period when poor coordination may be expected. Others prefer to maintain animals in slings until radiographic and clinical evidence
indicate that unrestricted activity is not detrimental to the
repair. If harnesses are maintained for longer periods, they
must be evaluated daily, and changed on regular occasions (e.g., every 3 days) for cleaning and to ensure that
rub sores do not develop. Additional application of external coaptation may aid to stabilize the operated limb in
the immediate post-operative period. While these harnesses help prevent fixation break down or device failure,
restriction of activity and movement also induces a certain
type of suffering "accepted" by some species better than
others. Nevertheless this aspect must be considered when
animals are placed in harnesses.
Clinical Assessments
The post-operative assessment itself may stress the animal. Assessment criteria should include food and water
intake as well as general attitude, weight bearing and pain

Suspension
Suspension system for sheep: the net is adapted from horse rescue principles (Fürst A, et al.) and was custom made for sheep as
a prophylactic measure to avoid refractures of their limbs after (experimental) osteosynthesis. A) The net prevents animals to
lie down while still being able to rest and move freely within the stall. The net is loosely wrapped around the rump, the soft
belts around the neck and hind limbs of the sheep still allowing them to urinate and defecate without problems. For this reason
only female sheep should be utilized for experiments requiring the suspension system. B) The net and belts are bundled above
the animal and fixed to a hook on the ceiling with a special device and pulley system that allows free rotation for 360°. A special
feeder is used with an extension below where the sheep can rest their heads while sleeping and hanging in the nets. Since social
contact is important, animals are never kept alone but always have another sheep as a neighbour.

score. As mentioned earlier, it is of utmost importance
that persons performing post-operative evaluations be
familiar with the animal species used and are adequately
trained. For example, under Swiss regulations, personnel
involved in animal studies are required to attend a training course, and be supervised by a person with demonstrated experience with the animals used. Ideally, postoperative assessments should include ground reaction
force measurements in large animals and appropriate
activity level measurements for rodents. More invasive
evaluations are usually only performed when problems,
such as illness develop in the patient.
Termination criteria
All animal studies should have clearly defined termination criteria, also called "humane endpoints", at which
point animal suffering is no longer justified by the scientific value the animal is providing. Such criteria have been
established and are published on the world wide web
[55]. They should be communicated and agreed upon by
the entire team prior to the start of the study. It is very
important that judgement of animal termination be made
by a veterinarian not directly vested in the "successful"
study completion. A protocol for recovery of any data and
collection of tissue samples in the case that an animal
needs to be euthanized prematurely should be established
to maximize the benefit from unfortunate animal sacrifice. There is a need to establish a consensus on the euthanasia methods used in the different species [56].
Ethical aspects
Moral issues in using animals for research purposes have
long been debated, are controversial, and remain far from
solution. We do not intend to re-trace this discussion
here, nor do we hope to have developed any new arguments or enlightenment. We take it for granted that using
animals as experimental models in biomedical and more
specifically in fracture healing research is both in principle
morally acceptable, justified by a search for improvements
to both animal and human quality of life, and accepted by
the general public overall. However, supporting the use of
animal models for fracture research does not amount to
an excuse for neglecting recognized welfare needs of the
animals utilised. Though welfare issues are becoming a
customary part of conducting research on animals far
more could be done in terms of specifying moral norms
and appropriate policies guiding animal research by
empirical data. It is our impression that the field of animal
welfare science is currently a fast developing area, and that
musculoskeletal research can benefit considerably by
adopting some of its insights. Therefore, our recommendation to improve anaesthesia and pain management protocols for animals involved in fracture research aims at
improving animal welfare irrespective of whether it is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2474/8/72

influencing research outcomes or not. That such considerations improve the results is an added benefit.
The currently insurmountable plurality of administrative
guidelines for animal research that constitute varying animal protection-levels does not, in our view, justify
researchers' practice of "regulation-hopping", e.g., to
adjust their research efforts to the lowest standard within
their reach. Instead, we claim that all researchers should
endeavour to actively find solutions for those moral problems generated or intensified through their research. This
entails continual engagement in the on-going animal welfare dialogue, and an improved surveillance mechanism
to allow more accessibility and visibility to new developments in improving animal welfare. Since this is typically
not a formal component of biomedical research education and training, perhaps forms of post-professional or
continuing education might be developed to provide such
necessary training. The hope that funding bodies and editors may adopt our recommendations for funding- and
publishing-decisions is grounded in this view. This would
also include journal editors' duties to reject manuscript
publications that do not document the application of
these ethical standards for the use of experimental animals in studies, and full disclosure of the consequences.
Need for international harmonization
To date, animal research issues are internationally harmonized on a minimum level. For example, the relevant legal
frameworks in Europe – the European Convention for the
Protection of Vertebrate Animals and the EC Council
Directive 86/609/EEC on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member
States regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes -were adopted more
than 20 years ago and urgently need modern revision,
which is presently under way. Therefore, the Council of
Europe as well as the European Community are encouraged to advance harmonized animal welfare standards for
scientific research. For this purpose, the legislative competences of the European Community should be expanded
to promote effective and binding EC regulation. Obviously, standards on these issues exist on all continents,
but at different levels, allowing researchers to export a
study to a country with less demanding requirement for
animal welfare issues. World-wide harmonization of such
issues is desperately needed to stop such behaviour.

As further harmonization on international and supernational levels cannot be achieved in the short run, it is
indispensable that, meanwhile, the situation for the
proper treatment of experimental animals in fracture
research be improved on the respective national levels. To
date, most national animal welfare acts are flexible
enough to implement the amendments presented in this

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2474/8/72

paper as a kind of good laboratory practice or guidelines
clarification while enforcing respective national laws.
Thus, national authorizations should in principle only be
granted if the intended animal experiment in fracture
research observes the improvements as proposed herein.
Moreover, ethics committees, wherever involved in the
process of authorization, should encourage the respective
applicants to address and adhere to the principles proposed in this paper. Where national authorities lack the
competence to enforce these principles they should at
least be observed by the scientific community on a voluntary basis. Finally, in trans-national research projects, the
proposed principles could become a subject of contractual
agreement between the scientific partners.

Future actions
The factors discussed here need to be openly and candidly
discussed, possibly amended and eventually agreed upon,
and the resulting standardized models for several targeted
orthopaedic applications tested widely in a number of
laboratories to validate the concept of a reproducible
international standard within and between laboratories.
This must be followed by a prospective multi-site study to
demonstrate the benefits of using such a standard. This
should be a funding priority by federal research agencies.
