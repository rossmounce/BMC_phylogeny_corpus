A codon substitution model that incorporates the
effect of the GC contents, the gene density and
the density of CpG islands of human
chromosomes
Kazuharu Misawa

Abstract
Background: Developing a model for codon substitutions is essential for the analyses of protein sequences.
Recent studies on the mutation rates in the non-coding regions have shown that CpG mutation rates in the
human genome are negatively correlated to the local GC content and to the densities of functional elements. This
study aimed at understanding the effect of genomic features, namely, GC content, gene density, and frequency of
CpG islands, on the rates of codon substitution in human chromosomes.
Results: Codon substitution rates of CpG to TpG mutations, TpG to CpG mutations, and non-CpG transitions and
transversions in humans were estimated by comparing the coding regions of thousands of human and
chimpanzee genes and inferring their ancestral sequences by using macaque genes as the outgroup. Since the
genomic features are depending on each other, partial regression coefficients of these features were obtained.
Conclusion: The substitution rates of codons depend on gene densities of the chromosomes. Transcriptionassociated mutation is one such pressure. On the basis of these results, a model of codon substitutions that
incorporates the effect of genomic features on codon substitution in human chromosomes was developed.
Keywords: Rate of molecular evolution, CpG hypermutability, codon substitution, gene density, chromosomal GC

Background
Accurate models of DNA and protein evolution are
essential for studying molecular evolution. Models of
DNA and protein evolution are used in homology
searches [1], sequence alignments [2,3], gene finding [4],
detection of natural selection [5-8], and reconstruction
of phylogenetic trees [9,10].
Recent studies on the mutation rates in non-coding
regions have shown that the mutation rates of CpGs in
the human genome are negatively correlated to the local
GC content [11-14] and to the densities of functional
elements [11].

CpG hypermutability [15] is known to be one of the
major causes of codon substitution in mammalian genes
[16-19]. CpG dinucleotides are often methylated at C,
and methylated C spontaneously deaminates to thymine
(T) approximately 10 times [20] or more [21] rapidly
than other types of point mutations. Approximately 14%
of codon substitutions are caused by CpG hypermutations [22]. Statistical indications of positive selection in
some sequences or individual codons may be caused by
a difference in mutation rates in the synonymous and
nonsynonymous sites because of CpG hypermutations
[23]. Previous studies that focused on the effect of CpG
hypermutation on the rate of amino acid change in the
human lineage [22,24] did not incorporate the regional
variation in the rates of codon substitution. Thus, the
regional variation in codon substitutions, especially

those related to CpG hypermutation, in the human genome is of interest.
To understand the effect of these genomic features
such as GC content, gene density, and frequency of
CpG islands on the rates of codon substitution, the
rates of codon substitution were estimated by using the
coding regions of thousands of human and chimpanzee
genes and inferring their ancestral sequences by assuming macaque genes as the outgroup. Since the genomic
features are interdependent, partial regression coefficients of these features were obtained. Multiple regression analyses to evaluate the effect of GC content, gene
density, and CpG island density on the rates of CpG to
TpG substitutions, TpG to CpG substitutions, and nonCpG transitions and transversions were conducted.

Results
The number of genes on each chromosome is listed in
Table 1. Table 1 also shows the GC content and the
gene and CpG island density on human chromosomes.
Figure 1 is a scatter plot of the synonymous rates of
CpG to TpG and TpG to CpG substitutions, non-CpG
transitions and transversions, and GC content of the
chromosomes. The open squares (□) show the synonymous substitution rate on autosomes. The closed

squares show the synonymous substitution rate on the
X chromosome. In all the cases, substitution rates on
the X chromosome are within the range of those on the
autosomes.
Figure 1 also shows that the synonymous CpG to TpG
substitution rates were negatively correlated to the GC
content of the chromosomes. In contrast, TpG to CpG
synonymous substitution rates were positively correlated
to the GC content of the chromosomes. As seen in
Table 2, these correlations were statistically significant
(P < 0.001), and all types of substitutions have a significantly negative correlation to the gene density (P <
0.001).
Since the genomic features are interdependent, partial
regression coefficients of these features were obtained.
Table 3 shows the rates of CpG to TpG and TpG to
CpG substitutions and non-CpG transitions and transversions. Except TpG to CpG substitutions, all types of
substitutions show a significant correlation with Grantham’s distance, GC content, gene and CpG island density, and chromosome size (P < 0.001).
Table 4 shows the difference between correlation coefficient squared (r 2 ) obtained by single regression to
Grantham distance and adjusted r2 obtained by multiple
regression to Grantham distance, GC content, gene

Discussion
In this study, codon substitution rates of CpG to TpG
mutations, TpG to CpG mutations, and non-CpG transitions and transversions were estimated by comparing

the coding regions of thousands of human and chimpanzee genes from entire genome and inferring their
ancestral sequences by assuming macaque genes as the
outgroup.
As seen in Figure 1, a marked difference was not
observed between the synonymous substitution rates of
autosomes and X chromosome. This result indicates
that the effect of “male-driven evolution” [25] is not
strong. The male-driven evolution is a phenomenon in
which the number of mutations is proportional to the
number of germ-line cell divisions, so that the sperms
have a higher rate of mutation than the eggs. There are
large discrepancies among the results of previous studies
with regard to the effect of male-driven evolution on
mutation rates [26] In this study, a large variation in the
rates of the substitution caused by CpG hypermutation
among chromosomes and genes was observed. The
mutation rate of the X chromosome was within the
range of the mutation rate among autosomes, which is
expected considering the variation in substitution rates
among chromosomes. Thus, this finding suggests that
the effect of male-driven evolution on the mutation rate
was less than that of regional variation.
Vogel and Motulsky [27] pointed out that since the
deamination of methyl-C occurs spontaneously and is
independent of DNA replication, the rate of CpG mutations should be scaled with time and not with the number of cell divisions. Recently, Taylor et al. [14]
investigated male mutation bias separately at non-CpG
and CpG sites by using human-chimpanzee whole-genome alignments. They concluded that CpG hypermutation is weakly affected by the number of cell divisions.
In this study, I demonstrated that the effect of male-driven evolution on CpG hypermutation is less strong than
that of other chromosomal properties. Thus, although
our result is similar to that of Vogel and Motulsky [27],
I cannot exclude the findings of Taylor et al. [14]. Variation in the mutation rates among chromosomes must be
one of the causes of the discrepancies among the results
of previous studies with regard to the effect of male-driven evolution on mutation rates. Therefore, further
study is warranted in this area.
Table 2 indicated that the CpG to TpG substitution
rates were negatively correlated to the GC content of

the chromosomes. This is consistent with the recent
finding that the CpG mutation rates in the non-coding
regions of human genes are positively correlated to the
local GC content [11-14]. On one hand, table 2 showed
that other types of substitution rates were positively correlated to the GC content of the chromosomes. On the
other hand, multiple regression analyses shown in table
3 indicated that other types of substitution rates were
negatively correlated to the GC content but the correlation was not significant. It should be noted that GC
content, gene density, and frequency of CpG islands
were correlated to each other. Discrepancy of these
coefficients indicates that the effects of genetic features
other than GC content on TpG to CpG substitution
rates might have overcome that of GC content.
The results presented in this study also suggest that
codon substitution rates are positively correlated to gene
density. The reason of this correlation is unclear, but it
might be due to fact that DNA melting is the rate-limiting step in cytosine deamination [28]. The difference
between CpG hypermutability of the coding and noncoding regions may be due to the difference in the reason of DNA melting in the 2 regions. In the case of the
coding regions, the cause of DNA melting is transcription; the DNA molecule separates into 2 single-strands
before being transcribed. The frequency of transcription
was positively correlated to the expression level of the
gene, which in turn was positively correlated to the
number of CpG islands [29]. In contrast, the reason for
DNA melting in the non-coding region is not transcription but denaturation. The base pairs open one at a
time, far below the melting temperature, and the halflife of individual GC base pairs are approximately 3
times longer than those of individual AT base pairs [30],
so that the rate of CpG hypermutability in the non-coding region is positively correlated to the local GC content. If this is the case, CpG hypermutability will depend
on the expression level of the genes. Recent study on
mouse genes showed that the effect of gene expression
level on codon bias is weaker than both the effect of
gene expression level on amino acid composition and
the effect of CpG hypermutability on codon bias [31], so
that effect of gene expression level on mutation rate
would be relatively small. Further study is needed in this
area.
In this study, the codon substitution rates were estimated by using the coding regions of thousands of
human and chimpanzee genes and inferring their ancestral sequences by assuming macaque genes as the outgroup. All types of substitutions show a significant
negative correlation to Grantham’s distance. This result
indicates that the properties of amino acids are one of
the major factors influencing the variation among nonsynonymous substitutions, as previously reported [22].

Page 5 of 7

The reason for the specific correlation found between
codon substitution rates and chromosome sizes might be
the physical distance between the genes and telomeres.
Tyekucheva et al. [11] suggested that distances from telomeres play important roles on mutation rates. However,
the numbers of substitutions are not very large; thus,
dividing too many bins by the distance from the telomeres may yield weak results. As more data become
available, incorporating these additional predictors in the
regression analyses may be beneficial. Of special interest
would be data on species other than humans.
On the basis of these results, a model that incorporates these genetic features was developed. The result
shown above indicates that including GC content, gene
density, CpG island density to the model improves the
ability of prediction of the substitution rates

Conclusion
The substitution rates of codons depend on gene densities of the chromosomes. Transcription-associated
mutation is one such pressure. On the basis of these
results, a model of codon substitutions that incorporates
the effect of genomic features on codon substitution in
human chromosomes was developed.
Methods
Data Set

To estimate the rates of codon substitutions, we used
10,372 orthologous gene trios obtained from human,
chimpanzee, and macaque genomes [32]. The alignment
of these genes comprised 4,717,227 codon triplets.
Macaque genes were used as the outgroup. It was
assumed that the human-chimpanzee divergence
occurred 5 million years (MY) ago [33].
Estimation of codon substitution rates by using the
maximum parsimony (MP) method

I determined the codon sequences of the common
ancestors of humans and chimpanzees by using the
maximum parsimony (MP) method. Next, I counted the
number of codon substitutions that had occurred along
the human lineage. For some codon trios, the ancestral
state between the human and chimpanzee codons
appeared ambiguous when estimated by the MP
method. In such cases, I treated all possible ancestral
states equally. I also calculated the substitution rates by
dividing the number of codon substitutions occurring
annually by the number of ancestral codons. The awk
program used in the analysis is available from the
author upon request.
Classification of codon substitutions

Because codon substitutions occur at different rates
[22,24], they were classified into 4 categories: CpG to

Misawa BMC Genomics 2011, 12:397
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/397

TpG substitutions, TpG to CpG substitutions, and nonCpG transitions and transversions. To distinguish CpG
to TpG substitutions and TpG to CpG substitutions
from non-CpG transitions, the adjacent nucleotides
were also considered. For example, a codon substitution
from CGC (Arg) to TGC (Ser) corresponds to a CpG to
TpG substitution. A codon substitution from GGT,
which codes Gly, to AGT, which codes Ser, corresponds
to one CpG to TpG substitution if the third nucleotide
of the 5’-adjacent codon is C. In contrast, a codon substitution from GGT to AGT is a non-CpG transition
mutation if the third nucleotide of the 5’-adjacent codon
is not C. If the observed nucleotide was T, its ancestral
nucleotide was C, and the downstream nucleotide was
G, the mutation was classified as a CpG type. If the
observed nucleotide was A, its ancestral nucleotide was
G, and the upstream nucleotide was C, the mutation
was again classified as a CpG type. If the observed
nucleotide was C, its ancestral nucleotide was T, and
the downstream nucleotide was G, the mutation was
classified as a TpG type. If the observed nucleotide was
G, its ancestral nucleotide was A, and the upstream
nucleotide was C, the mutation was again classified as a
TpG type. Other types of substitutions are classified
into two types: transitions and transversions [22,24,31].
Evaluation of the chemical properties of amino acids

The frequency of amino acid substitutions relative to the
frequency expected by chance decreases linearly with
the increase in physicochemical differences between the
amino acid pairs involved in a substitution. Grantham
[34] proposed a formula for estimating the difference
between amino acids; this formula combines the properties of amino acids such as composition, polarity, and
molecular volume, which correlate best with the substitution frequencies of protein residues. In this study, I
compared codon substitution rates with Grantham’s [34]
distance.
Comparison between codon substitution rates and GC
content, gene density and the density of CpG islands by
using multiple regression analysis

I compared the codon substitution rates with the GC
content and the gene and CpG island density, which are
defined as the number of genes and CpG islands per
MB of the chromosome, respectively. The GC content
of each chromosome was calculated using the human
reference sequence build 37. The gene density of each
chromosome was calculated from the data in Ensembl
release 57, and the density values of the CpG islands
were taken from the study by Varriale and Bernardi
[35]. Because of the lack of sufficient data, the relationship GC content, gene density and the density of CpG
islands could not be analyzed. The substitution rates

Page 6 of 7

were then multiplied by 108 to simplify the calculation
and transformed to their natural logarithms, as in a previous study [22]. These values were used in multiple
regression analyses, which was performed using the statistical software R [36].
