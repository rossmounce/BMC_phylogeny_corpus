Abstract
Background: Rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) is a pararetrovirus, and a member of the family
Caulimoviridae in the genus Badnavirus. RTBV has a long open reading frame that encodes a large
polyprotein (P3). Pararetroviruses show similarities with retroviruses in molecular organization
and replication. P3 contains a putative movement protein (MP), the capsid protein (CP), the
aspartate protease (PR) and the reverse transcriptase (RT) with a ribonuclease H activity. PR is a
member of the cluster of retroviral proteases and serves to proteolytically process P3. Previous
work established the N- and C-terminal amino acid sequences of CP and RT, processing of RT by
PR, and estimated the molecular mass of PR by western blot assays.
Results: A molecular mass of a protein that was associated with virions was determined by in-line
HPLC electrospray ionization mass spectral analysis. Comparison with retroviral proteases amino
acid sequences allowed the characterization of a putative protease domain in this protein.
Structural modelling revealed strong resemblance with retroviral proteases, with overall folds
surrounding the active site being well conserved. Expression in E. coli of putative domain was
affected by the presence or absence of the active site in the construct. Analysis of processing of CP
by PR, using pulse chase labelling experiments, demonstrated that the 37 kDa capsid protein was
dependent on the presence of the protease in the constructs.
Conclusion: The findings suggest the characterization of the RTBV protease domain. Sequence
analysis, structural modelling, in vitro expression studies are evidence to consider the putative
domain as being the protease domain. Analysis of expression of different peptides corresponding
to various domains of P3 suggests a processing of CP by PR. This work clarifies the organization of
the RTBV polyprotein, and its processing by the RTBV protease.

Background
Plant pararetroviruses are classified as members of the
family Caulimoviridae which comprises 6 genera [1]. Like
retroviruses, members of this group of viruses use reverse
transcriptase for replication of the genome [2,3]. However, they differ in two major points: retroviruses have an
RNA genome whereas pararetroviruses have a DNA
genome; and, a proviral form of retroviruses is integrated
into the host chromosome whereas the DNA of pararetroviruses accumulates within the nucleus as multiple copies
of a circular chromosome [4].
Retroviruses and pararetroviruses show similarities in
their molecular organization and replication process and
are phylogenetically related. These groups of viruses direct
the production of a terminally redundant RNA which is
used as a replicative intermediate and as mRNA. Many of
the genes encoded by pararetroviruses are homologous in
sequence and/or analogous in function to those of retroviruses. The genome of all replication-competent retroviruses consists of three major genetic elements that are
arranged in the order gag-pol-env (structural-replicationenvelope proteins). Each protein is produced as a result of
frameshifting during translation, or suppression of stop
codons in the polyproteins. Products of the gag ORF represent the structural components of the viral matrix, i.e.
capsid and nucleocapsidproteins; the pol domains generally comprise the protease, reverse transcriptase, ribonuclease and an endonuclease/integrase. Pararetroviruses
encode the gag-pol core, but lack an integrase, as viral
DNA integration into the host chromosome is not
required [5].
Retrovirus and pararetrovirus polyproteins are believed to
be processed by their own aspartate proteases [3,6,7].
These proteases contain several conserved regions when
compared with each other and share consensus sequences
in the active site; however, they show no homology with
other viral proteases. Protein cleavages by these and other
proteases are dependant on amino acid sequence and
conformation near the cleavage site [6].
Rice tungro is a major rice disease in southeast asia and is
caused by a double infection by two viruses [8,9]: Rice
tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) [10,11], a member of the
genus Badnavirus in the family Caulimoviridae [1], and Rice
tungro spherical virus (RTSV), a single-stranded RNA virus
and member of the genus Waikivirus in the family Sequiviridae [12,13]. RTBV is responsible for symptoms of the
disease [8] and RTSV is required for the transmission of
the two viruses by the leafhopper vector Nephotettix virescens [14,15].
RTBV genome is a double stranded DNA of 8.0 kbp with
two site-specific discontinuities resulting from replication

by reverse transcriptase [3,16]. The RTBV genome has four
open reading frames (ORF) [17]. ORF3 has similarities
with the gag-pol core of retroviruses. The polyprotein (P3)
contains a putative movement protein (MP), the capsid
protein (CP), the aspartate protease (PR), and the reverse
transcriptase (RT) with a ribonuclease H activity. The Nand C- terminal amino acid (aa) sequences of the CP were
deduced from MALDI-TOF mass spectral analysis [18].
The location of the CP domain, which is encoded by aa
477–791 in P3, was confirmed by immunodetection reactions using antibodies raised against different segments of
ORF3 [18]. P3 sequence aa 985–995 shows homologies to
the active site of aspartate proteases encoded by retroviruses and pararetroviruses, with the sequence DSGS
believed to be the RTBV protease active site. Changing of
D to A (aspartic acid to an alanine) in this sequence affects
the proteolytic processing of the RT [19]. Detection of
RTBV gene products in vivo revealed a major protein of
13.5 kDa in virus preparations, by using an antibody
raised against the domain aa 881–1098 [10,20]. The antibody was used in immunogold labelling reactions and
showed binding on the surface of the virus particle, suggesting that the PR is located at or near the surface of the
virus particle [20].
In this paper, we used mass spectrometry analysis to characterize the RTBV protease domain in a protein associated
with purified virions, and confirm the hypothesis by in silico modelling and in vitro expression studies. Analysis of
products of in vitro processing of P3 suggests that RTBV
aspartate protease is involved in the release of the CP from
the polyprotein P3.

Results
Determination of molecular mass
In-line HPLC electrospray ionization was used to determine the molecular mass of proteins that were isolated in
preparations of RTBV. Several peaks were observed using
this method, none of which correspond to the known
molecular mass of the CP subunits [18]. Many of the primary peaks were accompanied by low amounts of proteins of similar but not identical charge: we presumed that
these peaks represented various charge statesof the peptide/protein. Reconstruction of the data, after algorithms
were applied to convert the family of ion peaks, gave a
protein with molecular mass of 13,794 ± 4 Da (Figure 1).
The lack of recovery or detection of proteins of the size of
CP subunits is likely the result of retention on the HPLC
column due to the very basic charge of the protein; estimated isoelectric point (pI) of CP is 9.43.
Localization of the protease domain
By comparing the known sequence of P3 protein in RTBV
with aspartate proteases encoded by other retroviruses we
predicted that five possible proteins could be derived with

a molecular mass of 13,794 ± 4 Da that could contain the
putative active site domain DSGS (at aa 987–990) and the
IIG sequence. The IIG sequence motif is conserved
amongst retroviral proteases and is located at aa 1063–
1065 in P3. The five predicted proteins (Figure 2) were
covering amino acids 965–1085, 967–1086, 971–1091,
982–1102, and 984–1104, with predicted molecular
masses of 13,790.71 Da, 13,790.71 Da, 13,796.7 Da,
13,791.7 Da and 13,795.7 Da, respectively. These predictions of the five domains are based on the combination of
molecular mass and the presence of conserved motifs, and

not on putative protease cleavage sites that flank the five
predicted proteins.
Structural model of the protease
The overall sequence similarity between aspartate proteases is quite low (below 25%) based on pairwise scoring
criteria; therefore we applied fold recognition methods to
detect remote homologues. The sequence alignment for
the proteins selected for analysis showed strong conservation in the active site of the proteins (Figure 3). The pairwise alignment between the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)

Putative protease domains for RTBV. Position of five peptides that include the active protease domains with molecular
mass that correspond to the mass spectrometry analysis. Peptide A has a predicted molecular mass of 13,790.71 kDa; peptide
B of 13,790.71 kDa; peptide C of 13,796.70 kDa; peptide D of 13,793.60 kDa; peptide E of 13,795.70 kDa. Underlined

template and the RTBV sequence was submitted to
comparative modelling. As represented in the model (Figure 4), there is a strong resemblance between the structures predicted for RTBV and RSV proteases. The lack of
identity in the predicted structures may be due to inherent
inaccuracy of the modelling programs, due to inherent
differences in the protein and substrate, and other characteristics. Taking these differences into account, as deduced
by a folding assignment system [21] (where reliable scores
were obtained) the protease sequence had a predicted
folding structure that was highly similar to several other
aspartate proteases. The overall fold surrounding the
active site was well conserved between the putative RTBV
protease and RSV protease used as template (Figures 3 and
4).
Induction of putative protease domain
Specific primers (Ab-PR-F and Ab-PR-R) were designed to
amplify the putative protease domain deduced from the
mass spectrometry analysis (Figure 2-A). DNA used for
PCR amplification included the full-length RTBV clone
pBSR63A, and plasmid pBS-mp/PR; the reactions led to
isolation of peptide PR and mPR, respectively (Table 1

and Figure 5). PR and mPR differ from each other only at
amino acid 987, in which the residue was changed from
Aspartic acid (D) to Alanine (A). Peptides were expressed
in E. coli and, following induction of gene expression the
extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and gels were
stained with coomassie blue (Figure 6-A). The expected
size of the peptides was about 14 kDa. We did not detect
a protein in cultures that contain pTr-PR. However, in
extracts of cultures containing pTr-mPR, the protein mPR
was easily detected at the expected position on the gel.
Western immunoblot assays using antibodies raised
against mPR (Ab-PR) confirmed that the 14 kDa peptide
was mPR (Figure 6-C).
Analysis of the processing of polyprotein P3
Pulse-chase labelling techniques were used to reveal possible processing of P3 by the protease in E. coli. After 1
hour induction cultures were labelled with 35S-methionine for five min after which protein extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography.
Multiple bands were observed in cultures that contain
each plasmid (Figure 7). Protein patterns represent peptides that are expressed and processed between 60 and 65

with one visible difference, namely the presence of a band

absent in cells containing pET-MP-mPR, the plasmid with

site sequences are placed in the extended loop of the structural model, implying that the active site is a number of
amino acids away from the N-terminal of retroviral
proteins.

Retroviral proteases have been studied for many years as
they are essential in the control of the replication of retroviruses. Retroviral proteases contain about 100 amino
acids residues in length, and contain one copy of the
active site Asp-Thr-Gly or Asp-Ser-Gly [22]. It was proposed that they are active as homo-dimers [23]. Crystallographic structures of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) and
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) showed that the
PR of the viruses are dimeric, with two copies of the active
site being brought into close proximity at the junction
between the dimer partners [24,25]. To date, numerous
retroviral proteases have been investigated, and their
structures determined [26]. The retroviral protease is
formed by duplication of four structural elements: a hair-

The CP domain was previously characterized by MALDITOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of
flight) mass spectrometry analysis [18]. A single CP
domain was identified, with positions of the amino- and
carboxy- termini of the CP at aa 477 and 791, respectively.
The molecular mass of the CP was determined to be
37,303 Da with an estimated pI of 9.43. A basic pI can
explain the absence of peaks related to the CP in our mass
spectral analysis. In this paper, virions of RTBV were subjected to in-line HPLC electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis. The HPLC column is expected to have
retained the CP prior to mass spectrometry analysis. The
molecular mass of the protein found by these analyses

code a peptide that contains the CP and the protease, i.e.

was determined to be 13,794 ± 4 Da, with a putative isoelectric point of 6.3. We suspected that this protein was
the viral protease that was encoded in P3 protein.
Five peptide domains, with the predicted mass of the protein identified in virions, were found to contain the active
site DSGS, the active site of an aspartate protease, and the
conserved region IIG (Figure 2). We compared the derived
sequences of the five putative proteins with sequences of
retroviral proteases, a process that led us to predict that
the peptide comprising aa 965–1085 represents the
protease, based on the position of the active site within
the predicted sequence. In the predicted protein the
Aspartic acid residue of active site would be 23 amino acid
away from N-terminus; the active site is 25 and 37 aa from
the N-terminus for HIV and RSV, respectively.
To confirm if the target sequence is or is not a protease, we
used a combination of sequence and structural predictions procedures to build a structural model for the RTBV

protease (Figure 4-A) with RSV protease as a template
(Figure 4-B). The consistency in fold recognition was
given by reliable scores against different templates for the
same SCOP classification (SCOP classification b.50.1).
The proteins of this fold show a closed beta barrel. In the
model, some of the beta strands elements are missing,
however the remaining beta sheets can be arranged in a
predicted conformation as they are product of sequence
duplications. Keeping in mind that the protease domain is
part of a multi-domain protein, additional interactions
among the domains may influence the folding of individual subunits. The conservation in the predicted active site,
and the predicted overall folding of sequences led us to
predict that the domain posseses a protease activity. Subsequent experiment evidence that confirmed that the predicted active site can be inactive by mutation of D to A, the
predicted secondary structure and the fold recognition
analyses with model building led us to conclude that the
protein comprises an aspartate protease.

Underlined restriction enzymes are sites that are present in ORF3.

Plasmids that encode peptides PR and mPR were introduced for expression in E. coli: however, PR did not accumulate in E.coli while mPR was expressed normally and
reacted with Ab-RTBV and with Ab-PR antibodies. In
other studies, the mutation of D to A in the active site of
the RTBV protease was shown to affect its activity [19]. We
suggest that PR did not accumulate in E. coli because the
peptide was an active protease that was not tolerated in
the host. Previous attempts to express proteases in E. coli
have had similar outcomes [27,28].
An antiserum against the region aa 881–1098 of the P3
was produced in previous studies [20]; this peptide
includes the protease domain. Using this antibody a protein of approximately 13.5 kDa was detected by western
blots assays in virus preparations and in infected tissues,
suggesting that the protein that was detected represented
the viral protease [20]. Furthermore, the antiserum was
used to label virus particles, and revealed that the label

was attached to virions. The characterization of PR
domain, and the immunodetection reactions performed
in the present studies are in agreement with the previous
results, and also with studies performed by Marmey et al.,
[18], which investigated a peptide comprising aa 806–961
of P3, that was referred to as IR. IR did not react with AbRTBV serum, suggesting that the IR region did not contain
sequences related to the CP. Our results support the
hypothesis that peptide IR corresponds to the intervening
region between CP and PR, and that it may be involved in
the processing of P3 [18]. With the present study the Nand C- terminal amino acid sequences are now characterized for CP, PR and RT-Rnase H [18,19]. However, we did
not identify apparent sequence similarities between the
cleavage sites that would be used by the PR (Figure 8).
Such a lack of sequence similarity is usual for viral aspartate proteases [29,30]. Other details that remain to
beclarified in the organization of P3 include:

characterization of the movement domain, and the order
and rates in which the various sites on P3 are cleaved.
A previous work conducted in insect cells using baculovirus based constructs, including constructs in which the
active site of the protease was mutated revealed that RT
was processed by PR [19]. In the present work, in vitro
processing of CP by PR was demonstrated in E.coli. If
immunoprecipitations with antibodies were not achieved
for technical reasons, presence of the 37 kDa peptide was
associated with co-existence of CP and active PR in the
construct. It is the first time that such a processing is demonstrated for pararetroviruses (e.g. Commelina yellow mottle virus, Banana streak virus, Cacao swollen shoot virus),
where CP and PR are components of the same
polyprotein.
Our results clarify the organization of P3, and its processing by its own protease and lead to a more complete
understanding of the replication process and possible
points of control of pararetroviruses.

Methods
RTBV strain used for the analysis
The RTBV strain used for the analysis was from the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI, Los Banos, Philippines). Sequence of the genome was published [11], with
accession number [GenBank:M65026].
Mutation of the active site of protease
Plasmid pBS-mp/RT [19] contain the putative mutated
protease and reverse transcriptase of RTBV. The aspartic
acid in the sequence DSGS (RTBV P3, amino acid 987)
was changed to alanine, resulting in the sequence ASGS.
Plasmid pBS-mp/RT was used for further sub-cloning.
Analysis by mass spectrometry
In-line HPLC electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
[31] was employed. The experimental protocol was

(Sciex) were used to convert the family of ion peaks,
which result from the protein being in various charge
states, to an accurate molecular mass. Virus sample was
denatured with guanidium hydrochloride at 4.8 M prior
to injection onto the column.
Sequence and structural prediction analyses
The RTBV sequence was used as a query for the BLAST program against non redundant databases and PDB databases. No significant hits were identified with suitable evalues by these queries. The sequence was then submitted
to fold recognition methods at the metaserver http://gen
esilico.pl[32]. Reliable templates were found with high
scores, all of which were found in retroviral proteases (all
beta proteins: SCOP classification b.50.1.1). Several pairwise alignments between RTBV and templates were
checked using SQUARE [33] and further submitted to
homology modelling using the Swissmodel program [34].
Models were evaluated using PSQS http://www1.jcsg.org/
psqs/[35] and Whatif http://www.cmbi.kun.nl/gv/serv
ers/[36] tools. The structure of the Rous sarcoma virus
(RSV) protease (pdb code 1bai_A) provided the best
model as a viral aspartate protease and was chosen for this
purpose. Illustrations for the model were generated using
MolMol [37].
Constructions of plasmids
The full-length RTBV clone pBSR63A [11] was used as
DNA matrix for PCR reactions to amplify specific regions
of ORF3 using specific primers that were designed to
amplify specific sequences from the RTBV genome. Con-

structs were obtained by cloning the PCR fragments into
vectors and/or by cloning fragments obtained after digestion of constructs with restriction enzymes and pBS-mp/
PR (Table 1). Cloning was conducted in pBluescript KS
vector (Stratagene/USA), in pTrHis vector (Invitrogen/
USA) and in pET vector (Novagen/USA). Restriction
enzymes were used according to manufacturer (GibcoBRL, USA).
Expression of proteins
All pTrHis based vectors were transformed into E.coli
DH5-α. The resulting plasmids were designated pTr-PR,
pTr-mPR and resulted in synthesis of peptides, named PR,
mPR, corresponding to regions between residues 965–
1085 (Figure 5), with plasmid pTr-mPR encoding peptide
with amino acid 987 mutated from D to A.
Analysis of in vitro processing
All pET vectors were transformed into E.coli BL21/DE3
(pLys S). The resulting plasmids were designated pET-MP,
pET-MP/PR, pET-P3, pET-MP/mPR, pET-mP3. These plasmids encode (in order) peptides, named MP, MP-PR, P3,
MP-mPR, mP3 corresponding to regions between residues
1–606, 1–1195, 1–1675, 1–1195, 1–1675, respectively
(Figure 5). Plasmids pET-MP/mPR and pET mORF3
encode peptides with amino acid 987 mutated from D to
A. Bacteria were induced with IPTG in M9 salts medium,
using rifampicin and an amino acid mixture that lacks
methionine. At 60 minutes, 35S radiolabelled methionine
was added for five minutes. Bacteria were centrifuged for
three minutes and resuspended in Laemli sample buffer

[38]. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis, the gel
was dried and exposed to x-ray film overnight.

Antibodies and Western blot analysis
Antibodies were obtained as previously described [18].
Peptide mPR, corresponding to region between residues
965–1085 and expressed with construct pTr-mPR, was
used to produce Ab-PR. An antiserum (Ab-RTBV) was also
raised against purified virions. Proteins were subjected to
electrophoresis in SDS/PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was incubated with antiserum at a 1:1000 dilution. Immunogenic proteins were
detected using an alkaline phosphatase goat anti-rabbit
IgG at 1:10000 dilution. Proteins were visualized in the
presence of nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro3-indoyl phosphate, or using the Biomax chemiluminescent detection system (Kodak/USA).
