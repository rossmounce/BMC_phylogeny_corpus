ProFITS of maize: a database of protein families
involved in the transduction of signalling in the
maize genome
Yi Ling†, Zhou Du†, Zhenhai Zhang, Zhen Su*

Abstract
Background: Maize (Zea mays ssp. mays L.) is an important model for plant basic and applied research. In 2009,
the B73 maize genome sequencing made a great step forward, using clone by clone strategy; however, functional
annotation and gene classification of the maize genome are still limited. Thus, a well-annotated datasets and
informative database will be important for further research discoveries. Signal transduction is a fundamental
biological process in living cells, and many protein families participate in this process in sensing, amplifying and
responding to various extracellular or internal stimuli. Therefore, it is a good starting point to integrate information
on the maize functional genes involved in signal transduction.
Results: Here we introduce a comprehensive database ‘ProFITS’ (Protein Families Involved in the Transduction of
Signalling), which endeavours to identify and classify protein kinases/phosphatases, transcription factors and
ubiquitin-proteasome-system related genes in the B73 maize genome. Users can explore gene models,
corresponding transcripts and FLcDNAs using the three abovementioned protein hierarchical categories, and
visualize them using an AJAX-based genome browser (JBrowse) or Generic Genome Browser (GBrowse). Functional
annotations such as GO annotation, protein signatures, protein best-hits in the Arabidopsis and rice genome are
provided. In addition, pre-calculated transcription factor binding sites of each gene are generated and mutant
information is incorporated into ProFITS. In short, ProFITS provides a user-friendly web interface for studies in signal
transduction process in maize.
Conclusion: ProFITS, which utilizes both the B73 maize genome and full length cDNA (FLcDNA) datasets, provides
users a comprehensive platform of maize annotation with specific focus on the categorization of families involved
in the signal transduction process. ProFITS is designed as a user-friendly web interface and it is valuable for
experimental researchers. It is freely available now to all users at http://bioinfo.cau.edu.cn/ProFITS.

Background
Maize (Zea mays ssp. mays L.) is an important economic
crop, and has served as a model organism for plant
genetic research for several decades. The B73 maize
genome was sequenced in 2009 [1-3], providing unprecedented opportunities for genome-wide annotation, classification and comparative genomics research. However,
the comprehensive maize genome sequence repositories,
MaizeSequence http://www.maizesequence.org [1] and
maizeGDB http://www.maizegdb.org/ [4] provide limited

information concerning gene families’ categorization.
The thriving of research discoveries may be hampered
under these circumstances.
Signal transduction is a fundamental biological process
in living cells for sensing, amplifying and responding to
various extracellular or internal stimuli [5]. Many gene
products (proteins) are involved in this process. During
the signal transduction process, the status of proteinprotein interaction, protein three-dimensional architecture, and the localization of proteins could be altered by
rapid changes in protein activities or stabilities. Protein
phosphorylation and ubiquitination are two major donators of these changes through post-translation covalent
modification. Furthermore, when they are associated

with transcription factors (TFs) that can lead to the
multitude transcription cascades, these proteins act as
switches allowing the proper and timely response of signal information flow and avoiding overreaction. In the
past two decades, identifying the components involved
in signal transduction and determining specific signalling pathways have both been functional research hotspots. However, genome-wide classification of gene
families involved in signal transduction of maize is still
limited.
With the aim to facilitate studies on signal transduction in the maize genome, we developed the ‘ProFITS’
(Protein Families Involved in the Transduction of
Signalling) of maize, a database which categorizes TFs,
protein kinases/phosphatases (PKs/PPs) and ubiquitinproteasome-system (UPS)-related genes in maize.

Construction and content
Data acquisition

The B73 maize genome dataset (version 4a.53) which
includes gene, transcript and protein sequences were
downloaded from MaizeSequence http://www.maizesequence.org/index.html [1]. Four maize full-length cDNA
(FLcDNA) datasets [3,6-8] were obtained from GenBank
[9] by the searching key ‘FLI-CDNA’. To the FLcDNA
dataset generated by Alexandrov [8], only high quality
sequences labelled as ‘completed cds’ were selected for
further analysis. To those FLcDNAs whose corresponding protein sequences were not available in GenBank, the
EMBOSS suite [10] was applied for protein translation
and the longest one of each FLcDNA was selected for
further analysis. In addition, consensus sequences of TF
binding sites (TFBS) were retrieved from two publicly
accessible comprehensive plant cis-element databases,
PLACE [11] and AtcisDB [12]. These two datasets were
further merged into one by performing manual curation
that low-quality or redundant TFBS consensus sequences
were filtered or integrated. Furthermore, mutant information including mutant gene name, phenotype and
location were obtained from MaizeGDB [4].
Comprehensive annotation to the maize genome and
FLcDNA sequences

First of all, InterProScan [13] was performed against the
maize genome protein sequences and FLcDNA translations, and GO (gene ontology) [5] annotations were generated based on InterProScan results. In addition to
InterProScan, Pfam [14] search was implemented separately using the newest version of Pfam database (Version
24.0, as of July 2010), because Pfam accessions were key
identifiers used for TF classification. The gathering cutoff (-cut_ga), which is the minimum score a sequence
must attain when building a full alignment of a Pfam
entry, is applied as threshold. After that, the FLcDNA

Page 2 of 6

sequences were localized to the maize genome using
GMAP [15] and correlated with maize genome transcripts using BLAST search [16]. Appearance of TFBS
within 3 kb upstream sequences of each transcript was
also computed by short sequence match with curated
binding site consensus sequences using regular expression method. Then, putative homologs in Arabidopsis
and rice genomes were identified using BLAST (E-value
≤ 1e-40 and Coverage ≥ 0.5).
After series analyses above of the maize genome and
FLcDNA data, we integrated the comprehensive annotation into ProFITS (see flowchart, Figure 1). All the data
were made easily accessible and searchable.
Category classification

We specifically classified three protein families involved
in signal transduction: the TFs, the PKs/PPs and the
UPS-related genes. Different strategies were designed
and depicted as follow.
The identification approach of TFs is adopted from
PlnTFDB [17], that TFs were predicted and classified
based on protein domains identified by the Pfam search.
For each TF family, there exists one or more required
domains, while several families contain forbidden
domains (See detailed rules in Additional File 1).
As for PKs/PPs, a modified PlantsP kinase Classification/PlantsP Phosphatase Classification (PPC) [18] is
used for family classification. The H and No_PPC (not
included in PPC yet) classes were added in this modified
PPC system. The H class consists of two-component system related genes (e.g. histidine kinases), while No_PPC
contains Hpt genes, casein kinase II and other kinases/
phosphatases that cannot be classified in the original
PPC classification. The sequences associated with
required protein domains defined by InterPro accessions
(which generated by InterProScan) were selected firstly.
Then BLAST (E-value ≤ 1e-10 and Coverage ≥ 0.5) was
done on candidate sequences against PPC classified Arabidopsis PKs/PPs sequences. The candidates were
assigned to different PPC groups according to their best
hit in the reference. The required InterPro accessions
and a modified PPC criterion which intend to gather all
the protein phosphorylation related genes in one category
can be explored in Additional File 1.
Lastly, we identified UPS-related genes employing
same method as in plantsUPS [19]. A group of InterPro
accessions (see Additional File 1) were used for classification of different UPS-related gene families. Since there
is no consensus accessions for RBX (Ring-Box) and
DDB which is a component of CDD (CUL4-RBX1-CDD
complex) families, BLAST search (E-value ≤ 1e-10 and
Coverage ≥ 0.5) against protein sequences of these
family members in Arabidopsis were implemented for
identification.

Database architecture

We constructed and configured ProFITS upon a typical
LAMP (Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP) platform.
The dataset was stored in MySQL 5.0 http://www.mysql.
com, and the web interface was built by PHP scripts
http://www.php.net on Red Hat Linux, powered by an
Apache server http://www.apache.org. Server-side scripts
were developed using Python http://www.python.org.

Utility and results
Web interface overview

In ProFITS, the TFs are all displayed in flat HTML tables,
PKs/PPs and UPS-related genes are represented in a hierarchical tree mode. When exploring a particular family in
these three categories, the genes including their transcripts
and FLcDNAs in the family are simultaneously accessible,
including the BLAST best-hits in Arabidopsis. The genome
dataset is displayed on two levels (gene and transcript
levels) as one gene may have one or more corresponding
transcripts. In the page for gene level, comprehensive
annotations (e.g. gene sequences, corresponding transcripts and mutant information) are provided. In the page
for transcript level, more information generated by protein

signatures analysis and gene function prediction is displayed because protein sequence is available for each transcript (Figure 2). Moreover, besides basic information
similar to that of the gene-level page, users can check GO
annotation, protein best-hits in the Arabidopsis and rice
genomes, protein signatures and pre-calculated TFBS
information in the transcript-level page. More detailed
information containing TFBS consensus, promoter
sequence and related annotations are available through
links in the transcript-level pages. The FLcDNA annotation pages provide similar content as transcript-level pages.
Feature tools and functionalities

ProFITS provides several analysis and exploration tools
to facilitate users’ research. An advanced search tool in
ProFITS supports not only maize sequence IDs, but also
IDs of Arabidopsis or rice, and Arabidopsis gene names.
Additionally, we integrated an adopted GO enrichment
analysis tool from agriGO [20], which facilitates users
to uncover hidden biological meanings from a userprepared list of gene IDs.
Genome browsers have been shown as one kind of
useful tools in inspecting sequence structures and

locations in a direct and visualized way - thus we set up
and configured two different browsers, GBrowse [21]
and JBrowse (Additional File 2) [22], catering to users’
different requirements. Mutual links between the database and GBrowse/JBrowse are available so that users
can easily switch aspects of the investigation to interesting targets.
Statistics of three identified categories in ProFITS

In ProFITS, there are 32,540 genes and 53,764 transcripts of the maize genome [1], and 51,709 FLcDNA
sequences. There were 2,505 genes identified as TFs in
the maize genome, distributed in 80 different TF
families; and 1,046 genes were identified as PKs/PPs.
Lastly, 1,044 genes were characterized in the 12 UPSrelated gene families (see statistical summary of three
categories of the maize genome in Table 1).

Discussion
Although information concerning maize TFs and UPSrelated genes can be found in PlnTFDB [17] and PlantsUPS [19], a complete profile of these two categories in
the maize genome is still deficient. Based on gene

annotation of the B73 maize genome (version 4a.53) and
FLcDNA datasets, ProFITS provides a basic platform for
maize functional genome research - the three key categories involved in signal transduction are particularly
identified and classified. In addition, the predicted TFBS
of genes together with TFs in ProFITS may provide
clues to determine the possible effective TFs in a specific signal transduction pathway.
Completed profiles of Arabidopsis and rice PKs/PPs
can be found in PlantsP [18] and RKD [23]; however, a
similar categorization is limited in maize. In ProFITS,
we identified 1,046 PK/PP genes and classified them
using an InterProScan-associated PPC system. Compared with Arabidopsis and rice (1,168 and 1,467 genes,
respectively) [18,23], the total number of maize PK/PP
genes is relatively small. This may due to our more
stringent identification method of applying InterPro
accessions in pre-selection. We chose Mitogen Activated
Protein Kinase (MAPK) subfamily from Arabidopsis,
rice and maize for phylogenetic tree analysis using similar parameters as Hamel et. al. [24] (see Figure 3). Four
clades were detected in the phylogenetic tree which is
same as previous report [24]. Interestingly, MAPK members from rice and maize, both of which are monocot,
are tend to be clustered on the same branches.
Jasmonate (JA) is a plant hormone (phytohormone)
which participates in multiple developmental processes.
The core of the JA-signalling module in Arabidopsis,
SCFCOI1/JAZ/MYC2, has been defined [25]. SCFCOI1 is
an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. After hormone perception by SCFCOI1, JAZ (JAsmonate ZIM domain) repressors are targeted for proteasome degradation, releasing
MYC2 and de-repressing transcriptional activation [26].
We checked the putative maize homologs of these genes
using reciprocal BLAST (data not shown), and found
that they were all in the corresponding categories of
ProFITS.
We collected all 1,230 Arabidopsis genes classified in
the signal transduction process (GO:0007165), and then
explored their annotation of molecular function. Interestingly, among 1,169 genes annotated to have catalytic
activities, > 60% have protein kinase activity (725) and
about 10% have phosphatase activity (133). Only 0.8% of
genes have protein ligase activity; however, this is threefold that of the 0.28% of all annotated with protein ligase
activity genes in the Arabidopsis genome, which indicates
their important roles in signal transduction processes.
Other genes such as receptors, TFs, two-component
response regulators and protein phosphatase type 2A
regulators are under molecular transducer activity, transcription regulator activity and enzyme regulator activity
terms, respectively (see Additional File 3). The GO distribution is consistent with our definition of ProFITS.

MAPK genes .There are 20, 15, 17 MAPK genes from Arabidopsis,
rice and maize, respectively, all of which contain an activation loop
-TXY- motif. One MAPK gene from human (HsERK1) was used as an
outgroup. The protein kinase domains of each sequence were
predicted by Pfam and aligned by ClustalW [27] using the
parameters: Pairwise alignment - Gap opening, 35.0, Gap extension,
0.75; Multiple alignment - Gap opening, 15.0, Gap extension, 0.30. A
Neighbour-Joining bootstrapped tree was constructed by MEGA 4.0
[28] using pairwise deletion and JTT matrix-based model, and
adjusted manually.

As ProFITS provides a platform of maize information,
its expansibility will be useful when new data is available
or a new gene family needs to be categorized.

Conclusions
ProFITS provides users with a comprehensive profile of
genes involved in signal transduction. Sequences of the
maize genome and four maize FLcDNA projects are
available, making it valuable for experimental
