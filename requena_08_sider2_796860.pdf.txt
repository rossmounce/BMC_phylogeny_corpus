Abstract
Background: Protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania are causative agents of a diverse spectrum of
human diseases collectively known as leishmaniasis. These eukaryotic pathogens that diverged early from
the main eukaryotic lineage possess a number of unusual genomic, molecular and biochemical features. The
completion of the genome projects for three Leishmania species has generated invaluable information
enabling a direct analysis of genome structure and organization.
Results: By using DNA macroarrays, made with Leishmania infantum genomic clones and hybridized with
total DNA from the parasite, we identified a clone containing a repeated sequence. An analysis of the
recently completed genome sequence of L. infantum, using this repeated sequence as bait, led to the
identification of a new class of repeated elements that are interspersed along the different L. infantum
chromosomes. These elements turned out to be homologues of SIDER2 sequences, which were recently
identified in the Leishmania major genome; thus, we adopted this nomenclature for the Leishmania elements
described herein. Since SIDER2 elements are very heterogeneous in sequence, their precise identification
is rather laborious. We have characterized 54 LiSIDER2 elements in chromosome 32 and 27 ones in
chromosome 20. The mean size for these elements is 550 bp and their sequence is G+C rich (mean value
of 66.5%). On the basis of sequence similarity, these elements can be grouped in subfamilies that show a
remarkable relationship of proximity, i.e. SIDER2s of a given subfamily locate close in a chromosomal
region without intercalating elements. For comparative purposes, we have identified the SIDER2 elements
existing in L. major and Leishmania braziliensis chromosomes 32. While SIDER2 elements are highly
conserved both in number and location between L. infantum and L. major, no such conservation exists when
comparing with SIDER2s in L. braziliensis chromosome 32.
Conclusion: SIDER2 elements constitute a relevant piece in the Leishmania genome organization.
Sequence characteristics, genomic distribution and evolutionarily conservation of SIDER2s are suggestive
of relevant functions for these elements in Leishmania. Apart from a proved involvement in posttrancriptional mechanisms of gene regulation, SIDER2 elements could be involved in DNA amplification
processes and, perhaps, in chromosome segregation as centromeric sequences.

Background
Repetitive DNA sequences constitute a substantial proportion of eukaryotic genomes. For example, in mammals
they account for nearly half of the genome, and in some
plants they constitute up to 90% of the genome [1]. Most
of these repeated DNAs are, or were originated from,
transposable elements (TEs, also known mobile elements) through transposing and duplicating events. On
the basis of mechanisms of their transposition, TEs can be
divided into two classes: retrotransposons, which proliferate via reverse transcription, and DNA transposons, which
move strictly through DNA intermediates. Frequently,
genomes harbour few active TEs; instead, genomes contains multiple repetitive elements representing remnants
(or dead elements) derived from TEs [2]. Although repetitive DNA elements have been often considered as "selfish" or "parasitic" DNAs, the now growing evidence is that
these elements are involved in shaping genomes and are
playing important role in epigenetic regulation of genome
expression [1,3].
Protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania are causative
agents of a complex of diseases known as leishmaniasis.
The burden associated with these diseases remains important: 1.5–2 million new cases per year and 350 million
people at risk in 88 countries [4]. Apart from its impact in
human health, Leishmania parasites and related trypanosomes (i.e. Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei) are
being extensively studied because of peculiar molecular
and cellular characteristics. The genome of Leishmania
major was sequenced [5], and more recently the genome
sequences for two other Leishmania species (Leishmania
infantum and Leishmania braziliensis) have been also deciphered [6]. The comparison of these sequences reveals
marked conservation of the genome architecture within
the Leishmania genus, showing similar gene content and a
remarkable degree of synteny [7]. The organization of protein-coding genes into long, strand-specific, polycistronic
clusters is a conspicuous feature of the Leishmania species,
also observed in the T. brucei and T. cruzi genomes [8].
This peculiar gene organization seems to be related to the
lack of transcriptional control by RNA polymerase II promoters; rather, transcription initiation appears to begin in
a low fidelity manner transcribing long polycistronic precursor transcripts [9]. Despite having diverged 200 to 500
million years ago, the genomes of L. major, T. brucei and
T. cruzi are highly synthenic. For example, 68 and 75% of
the genes in T. brucei and L. major remain in the same gene
order [8]. In spite of this conservation in chromosome
organization, the genomes of these trypanosomes differ in
the content of repeated sequences. Unlike Leishmania, the
genomes of T. brucei and T. cruzi are riddled with interspersed elements [10-12].

The Leishmania genome is relatively poor in repeated
sequences. The first repetitive DNA sequence characterized in Leishmania corresponded to the telomeric repeats
[13]. Afterwards, multiple tandem repeats of a 60-bp
sequence, named Lmet2, were found on at least six chromosomes of parasites of the L. donovani complex, being
absent from other Leishmania species [14]. Piarroux et al
[15] characterized a low copy, repetitive DNA sequence
from L. infantum that was located exclusively at a large
chromosome; this sequence was detected in many other
Leishmania species. A repeated sequence with features of
minisatellite DNA was characterized in the L. infantum
genome; this element, called LiSTIR1, is 81-bp long and
G+C rich and it was found interspersed at the subtelomeric regions of four chromosomes [16]. A 348-bp long element, designated LiR3, was found tandemly repeated
within the non-transcribed spacers of the rDNA locus of L.
infantum [17]. Conserved repeats, named LCTAS, have
been characterized to be adjacent to telomeres in L. braziliensis, L. major, L. mexicana and L. lainsoni [18]. Also,
several subtelomeric repetitive sequences have been characterized, showing to be responsible for size differences
among the three L. major homologues for chromosome 1
[19]. Similar repeats have been found as tandemly
arranged clusters at subtelomeric regions in chromosomes
1, 19 and 22 of L. infantum. Interestingly, these repeats are
transcribed by RNA polymerase II into noncoding RNAs
in a developmentally regulated manner [20]. Non-LTR
retrotransposons are abundant in the genome of T. brucei
and T. cruzi; by contrast, retroelements are absent from the
L. major genome, where only remnants of degenerated
ingi/L1Tc-related elements (or DIREs) are detectable (the
L. major haploid genome contains 52 DIREs). Evolutionary analyses indicate that the trypanosomatid ancestor
contained active transposable elements that have been
retained in the genus Trypanosoma, but were lost in the L.
major evolutionary line [21]. Recently, in an outstanding
work, Bringaud et al [22] have found that the L. major contains two classes of short interspersed repeated sequences,
SIDER1 (785 copies) and SIDER2 (1073 copies), which
displays hallmarks of trypanosomatid retroposons. Members of the SIDER1 family show high sequence similarity
with a conserved 450–550-bp element, located in the
3'UTR of several Leishmania amastigote-specific transcripts, that is implicated in stage-specific translational
control [23,24]. SIDER2 elements, also located predominantly within 3'UTRs, have a demonstrated role in mRNA
degradation [22]. Thus, it was postulated that Leishmania
have recycled the retroposon remnants to regulatory
sequences to globally modulate the expression of a
number of genes [22].
In the course of studying repetitive DNA in the L. infantum
genome, we identified and characterized a family of
repeated sequences, which are interspersed along the dif-

ferent chromosomes. These sequence elements are present
in different Leishmania species and, here, we show a
detailed analysis of these elements in the L. infantum chromosomes 20 and 32, and in the L. braziliensis and L. major
chromosome 32. During the preparation of this manuscript, the existence of this class of sequences in the L.
major genome was reported [22], and, consequently, we
adopted the proposed name (SIDER, Short Interspersed
Degenerated Retroposon) for the elements identified in
this work.

subfamily was defined as a group of LiSIDER2s sharing
sequence identity ≥ 85%. Thus, the 54 LiSIDER2s can be
grouped into 13 subfamilies (named A to M), remaining
9 orphan elements (Table 1; Fig. 2). Remarkably, members of a given subfamily show a relationship of proximity, i.e. they are grouped close in the chromosome without
intercalating non-familiar LiSIDER2s (Fig. 1). For example, elements of the subfamily A, composed of eight members, are located at the left hand of L. infantum
chromosome 32 and no at other chromosomal regions.

Results

Another structural feature of LiSIDER2 elements, evidenced during the bioinformatics identification of the elements, was their composite nature. Thus, the elements
from different subfamilies share only sequence blocks of
variable size that are present in different combinations in
each LiSIDER2. An example illustrating this observation is
shown in Figure 3A. Nevertheless, a conserved consensus
sequence for the LiSIDER2s can be derived from the alignment of the 54 elements present in chromosome 32 (Fig.
3B), suggesting a common origin for all elements. As suggested by Bringaud et al. [22], SIDER2 elements could be
vestigial retroposons, derived from non-LTR retrotransposons of the ingi/L1Tc clade that remains active in the
genomes of T. brucei and T. cruzi [21]. This hypothesis is
based mainly upon the existence at the 5'-extremity of
some LmjSIDER2 elements of the "79-bp signature",
which constitutes the hallmark of trypanosomatid nonLTR retrotransposons and related elements [26]. Using the
two "79-bp signatures" found in the L. major SIDER2 elements (LmSIDER2a and LmSIDER2b, [22]) for BLASTN
searches, we found 35 matches in the L. infantum chromosome 32 sequence. Interestingly, 34 out of the 35 matches
were coincident with the location of LiSIDER2 elements,
indicating that this is not a fortuitous association. Thus,
34 (63%) out of the 54 SIDER2 elements, present in L.
infantum chromosome 32, have a distinguishable "79-bp
signature" that invariantly is located at, or close to, the
5'end of the element. For most of the LiSIDER2, the "79bp signature" was found to be more similar to the
LmSIDER2b sequence than to the LmSIDER2a one (Table
1). A comparison of the consensus "79-bp signature"
present in the LiSIDER2s with that existing in other
trypanosomatid elements is shown in figure 3C. For some
LmjSIDER2 elements (18.9%), the presence of putative
target site duplication (TSD) was noticed by Bringaud and
co-workers [22]. However, after inspection of sequences
immediately upstream and downstream of the different
LiSIDER2s in chromosome 32, we did not find clear TSD
sequences, even though when members of a subfamily
were separately analyzed. Also, the presence of short adenosine-rich stretches was described at the 3'-end of some
of the LmjSIDER2 elements. In the characterized
LiSIDER2, adenosine runs were found to be present in

Identification of a new family of repeated sequences in L.
infantum
As an approach to isolate and identify repetitive sequences
in the L. infantum genome, we hybridized genomic DNA
macroarrays of L. infantum (JPC strain) with labelled total
genomic DNA of this parasite. A clone, named pGLi5G8g, was selected for further analysis on the basis of its
strong hybridization signal. Sequence analysis showed
that the 2280-bp long insert locate on L. infantum chromosome 32 (EMBL accession number AM937229). However, the most striking observation, derived from the
BLAST analysis, was that sequences, homologous to the
5'-end region of this clone, were also present in many
additional locations in all the 36 L. infantum chromosomal contigs. A thoughtful search along the L. infantum
chromosome 32 (contig LinJ32_20070420_V3; [25]),
using iterative rounds of BLAST searches, led us to the
identification up to 54 sequence elements. We named
these elements as LiSIDER2s, following the nomenclature
coined by Bringraud and coworkers in a recent publication describing the existence of this class of sequences in
the L. major genome; SIDER stands for short interspersed
degenerated retroposon [22]. The different LiSIDER2s
found in chromosome 32 are listed in Table 1. These elements have two salient features: a size around 550 bp and
a high G+C content (mean value 66.5%). Based on the L.
infantum database (GeneDB), we have calculated that the
G+C content for the L. infantum chromosome 32 is 58.8,
very similar to the G+C content for the whole L. infantum
genome [7]. All LiSIDER2 elements have G+C content
higher than the mean value for the entire genome, and
some of them exceed 70%. A physical location of the
LiSIDER2 elements on L. infantum chromosome 32 is
shown in figure 1. These elements were found in both
plus and minus strands of the chromosome and they
showed a quite even distribution along the chromosome.
However, it is noticeable that most of the elements have
the same orientation as the polycistronic transcription
units in which they are located.

Phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 2), based on the ClustalW
alignment of the different LiSIDER2s [see Additional file
1], allowed us to group these elements into subfamilies. A

about 28% of the elements, either at the 3'-end or in close
proximity to it.
In order to know whether or not this peculiar organization of LiSIDER2 elements is shared by the elements
located in other L. infantum chromosomes, we carried out
a systematic search of LiSIDER2s along the chromosome
20. We chose this chromosome, because we realized that
sequences similar to LiSIDER2s had been previously
described in the homologue chromosome in L. major
[27]. As shown in Table 2, 27 elements were identified in
the L. infantum chromosome 20. Similarly, these
LiSIDER2s were found to have G+C-rich sequences, to
have a size around 500-bp, and can be grouped in subfamilies according to sequence homology (N to S). In
chromosome 20, we found that members of subfamilies
Q and R are intercalated (Fig. 4A); however, it should be
noted that these subfamilies are closely related each other
in sequence (Fig. 4B; [see Additional file 2]). Another relevant finding was that two LiSIDER2s, which constitute
subfamily S (Table 2), have an uncommon size (1270bp), being the SIDER2-homologue region located at the
3'-end half of these elements. As occurred with LiSIDER2s
of chromosome 32, most of LiSIDER2s in chromosome
20 are in the same orientation as the transcriptional units
(Fig. 4A). Furthermore, 15 out of the 27 (56%) LiSIDER220 have a distinctive "79-bp signature" (Table 2).
As deduced from BLAST analyses (data not shown), the
rest of L. infantum chromosomes must be also populated
by LiSIDER2 elements showing similar features as those
described in chromosomes 20 and 32. Taking into
account both the chromosomal size and the number of
SIDER2s found in L. infantum chromosomes 20 and 32,
we estimated that the L. infantum haploid content of
SIDER2s would be around 1150 copies. This estimation is
in agreement with the determination of 1073 copies of
LmjSIDER2 in the L. major genome [22].

Sequences homologous to LiSIDER2s are also present in
the genome of other Leishmania species
Since the complete sequence of the L. major is known [5],
we carried out the same bioinformatics analysis on the L.
major database using as query sequences the different
LiSIDER2 elements found in the L. infantum chromosome
32 (Table 1). In all cases, the best scores were observed
with sequences located in the L. major chromosome 32.
Table 1 summarizes molecular features of the SIDER2s
found in the L. major chromosome 32. Remarkably, it was
observed an extremely high conservation, both in
sequence and genomic location, of the SIDER2s found in
the L. major and L. infantum chromosomes 32. To avoid
confusion, following the genetic nomenclature directions
for kinetoplastids [28], we named the L. major elements as
LmjSIDER2. In an independent study, Bringaud et al [22]
identified 55 SIDER2s elements in the L. major chromosome. Except for small variations in the coordinates, there
was a total correspondence between the 54 elements identified by us (Table 1) and those identified by Bringaud
and colleagues. Our analysis failed to find the LmjSIDER2
starting at position 626445 [22].

Recently, the completion of the L. braziliensis genome
sequence has been announced [6], and we considered of
interest to search for the existence of these elements in this
species. First analyses indicated that SIDER2 sequences
indeed exist in the L. braziliensis genome, but the distribution of the elements in the chromosome 32 was not conserved regarding the conspicuous conservation of SIDER2
elements that exists between L. infantum and L. major
chromosome 32. Thus, BLAST searches using the
LiSIDER2 sequences from chromosome 32 showed that
best scores were not with sequences from L. braziliensis
chromosome 32. Rather, bestfits for each LiSIDER2-32
sequence were found with sequences distributed among
the different L. braziliensis chromosomes, indicating that
SIDER2s are not chromosome specific for all Leishmania
species. However, the intrachromosomal organization of
these elements in the L. braziliensis genome showed features similar to that found in the other two Leishmania
species. Thus, most of the 48 LbSIDER2 elements, which

Clustering
Clustering by phylogenetic analysis of SIDER2 elements found in the L. infantum chromosome 32. The alignment
of the SIDER2 sequences was produced by ClustalW [see Additional file 1]. The phylogenetic tree was constructed with the
program MEGA version 3.1 using the Neighbour-Joining method. The elements 32-775723r and 32-1141454r were excluded
from the phylogenetic analysis because the program failed when calculating the Kimura distances for these sequences. Bootstrap values, expressed as percentages, were obtained from 1000 replicates. Only values higher than 50 are shown. The positions of the different subfamilies (A-M) are shown in the right margin. The scale represents number of changes per nucleotide.

ever, all entries contained Leishmania sequences and
homologous sequences were not found in other organisms, with an intriguing exception. Thus, we found a significant homology between LiSIDER-32-121058d and the
EMBL entry with accession number AM094505, which
corresponds to a Lutzomyia longipalpis EST clone NSFM162h01. Remarkably, this sandfly species acts as Leishmania transmission vector. On the other hand, BLAST
searches in the T. cruzi and T. brucei genome databases
(GeneDB) yielded not results, indicating that these elements are specific for the Leishmania genus. Among the
retrieved entries from the EMBL and GenBank databases,
there are sequences derived from L. amazonensis (U70540,
AB029444, AY427440S3, DQ092336), L. braziliensis
(DQ092335), L. donovani (Z94053, AC093553,

(Z54138, AY227807, AY328521, AY491007), L. mexicana
(Z46971, AF350492, AJ131960, AJ427448, AJ548776,

AY170465), and L. tarentolae (AY842846). Remarkably,
there exist many entries corresponding to L. chagasi
cDNAs (CV669830, CV667316, CV670663, CV663048,
CV669636,

CV664167,
CV669564,
CV669797,
CV665051, CV663324, CV668078, CV668316) that have
significant BLAST scores with SIDER2 sequences.
The bioinformatics analysis indicated that SIDER2 elements are widespread among the different Leishmania species. In order to obtain experimental evidence, Southern
blots containing SalI-digested genomic DNA from L.
infantum, L. major, L. tropica, L. mexicana and L. braziliensis
were probed with two different LiSIDER2s, LiSIDER2-32121058r and LiSIDER2-20-575257d (Fig. 5). Complex
hybridization patterns were obtained with each one of the
probes, confirming the repeated nature of the SIDER2 elements. The hybridizations patterns are also in agreement
with a scattered distribution of these elements in the Leishmania genome. Although, differences were observed in
the signal intensity of particular bands among the different Leishmania species, the global hybridization signal was
found very similar, suggesting that a similar number of
SIDER2s elements must be present in the different species
tested.

Discussion
In a recent work, Bringaud and co-workers [22] identified
two related families of small elements by a bioinformatics
analysis of the L. major genome sequence using as bait the
"79-bp signature" common to trypanosomatid retroposons [21]. These families, named LmSIDER1 and
LmSIDER2, contain 785 and 1073 copies per haploid
genome, respectively. These authors raised a compelling
hypothesis: these elements are extinct retroposons that
have been recycled to accomplish regulatory functions for
gene expression in Leishmania. Here, we describe the existence of this class of elements in the genome of L. infantum
and other Leishmania species. The starting point of our
work was the isolation from a macroarray of a clone showing strong hybridization signal when L. infantum total
DNA was used as probe. Sequencing of this clone indicated that it contains a genomic fragment of chromosome
32, but the bioinformatics analyses showed also that this
clone would contain a repeated sequence because significant homology with different sequences located on the
different L. infantum chromosomes was observed. After a
thoughtful analysis, we identified a total of 54 elements in
the L. infantum chromosome 32 and 27 elements in the
chromosome 20. Sequence comparisons analysis between
the repeated elements identified in this work with those
described by Bringaud and co-workers in L. major, suggest
that the elements described here belong to the SIDER2
family [22].

the position according the contig LbrM32 (version 2.0) sequence; d
and r denote that the element is located on the plus or minus strand,
respectively.
*Truncated element.

SIDER2 elements show outstanding features regarding
genomic organization ([22]; this work): i) the elements
are abundant and distributed along the different chromo-

somes in all Leishmania species; ii) the elements constitutes subfamilies related in sequence and genomic
vicinity; iii) the L. major and L. infantum SIDER2s are
highly conserved both in sequence and chromosomal
location. This degree of conservation in chromosomal
location is not maintained between the L. major/L. infantum and L. braziliensis SIDER2s (at least for chromosome
32). It should be kept in mind that L. braziliensis is the
most genetically and biologically divergent of the three
species analyzed for this study [29]. A remarkable difference, which may be related with the variations in genomic
distribution of SIDER2 elements among the Leishmania
species, is that L. braziliensis possesses potentially active
retrotransposons that are absent in the other two Leishmania species [6].
Accumulating data from different organisms do indicate
that mobile elements and non-coding repetitive
sequences are important elements in a genome and may
be playing functional roles that vary from control of gene
expression to chromosomal organization [1,3]. In this
regard, the sequence features and genomic organization of
SIDER2 elements are suggestive of relevant functional
roles, but what kind of function can they be playing? The
search for these elements within coding regions in L.
infantum predicted genes indicates that no SIDER2
sequences are in coding region. The sole exception to this
rule is the L. infantum database entry LinJ10_V3.1340,
which contains sequence homology to SIDER2s. However, this entry is considered as pseudogene, since its
sequence contains several in-frame stop codons. Remarkably, this putative pseudogene shows high sequence conservation with genes containing uninterrupted ORF in
other
kinetoplatids:
LmjF10.1225
(L.
major),
LbrM10_V2.1350
(L.
braziliensis),
Tc00.1047053506153.6
(Trypanosoma
cruzi)
and
Tb927.8.4690 (T. brucei). In spite of this particular finding, as overall conclusion, it must be stated that SIDER2
elements are rare in coding sequences.
On the other hand, several lines of evidence suggest that
SIDER2 elements are frequently found in untranslated
regions (UTRs) of genes, mainly 3'UTRs. Using both bioinformatics and experimental approaches, Bringaud et al.
[22] demonstrated that SIDER2 elements are present in 3UTRs of many different genes. Furthermore, these authors
showed experimental evidence that SIDER2 sequences are
promoting downregulation of mRNA steady state levels.
In addition, our database analyses showed that several L.
chagasi cDNAs have SIDER2 sequences, reinforcing the
idea that these elements are frequently found in UTRs of
mRNAs, playing putative regulatory role in gene expression.

Southern blot analyses of the genomic distribution of SIDER2 sequences in different Leishmania species.
Figure 5
Southern blot analyses of the genomic distribution of SIDER2 sequences in different Leishmania species.
Genomic DNA (SalI-digested) of L. infantum (lane 1), L. major (lane 2), L. tropica (lane 3), L. mexicana (lane 4), and L. braziliensis
(lane 5) was analyzed by Southern blotting using as probes either LiSIDER2-32-121058r (panel A) or LiSIDER2-20-575257d
(panel B).

Extrachromosomal DNA amplifications are commonly
observed in different Leishmania species either after drug
pressure or even in natural isolates [30,31]. When parasites are subjected to selective stresses, appropriate
genomic DNA regions, containing flanking repeats, are
amplified as extrachromosomal structures. According to
the Beverley's model for explaining DNA amplification
phenomena, the Leishmania genome should contain
amplification-prone cassettes [30]. Thus, the genomic
organization of SIDER2 elements in the Leishmania chromosomes (see Figs. 1 and 4) could be related with the
amplification mechanism. Interestingly, another prediction of the model is the existence of two types of cassettes,
those flanked by direct repeats and those flanked by
inverted repeats. SIDER2 elements are found in both
direct and inverted orientations, which further suggest
their possible implication in Leishmania DNA amplification. In order to find additional cues supporting this idea,
we looked for SIDER2 sequences in characterized DNA
amplification structures of Leishmania. Remarkably,
SIDER2 related sequences were found in several GenBank
and EMBL entries corresponding to Leishmania DNA
amplification structures. For example, three repeated
sequences (RS1, RS2 and RS3) were identified in close
proximity to the recombination points of extrachromosomal linear DNA amplicons M210 and M230 of L. major
[32]. Schematic drawings for M210 and M230 amplicons,

and for the genomic region of the source chromosome are
depicted in figure 6A. Both amplicons have an inverted
repeat structure, and the inversion occurred between
repeats RS1 and RS2 for M210, and between RS2 and RS3
for M230. The three repeated sequences are 374-bp in size
and show a high level of sequence identity (98%) [32].
These repeated sequences have a remarkable homology
with LiSIDER2 sequences (figure 6B), suggesting that they
are members of an LmjSIDER2 subfamily. In other example, the repeated sequences, postulated to be involved in
the formation of a linear amplicon in L. tarentolae [33],
also share significant sequence homology with LiSIDER2
elements. These data suggest that indeed SIDER2 elements
could be involved in the generation of some Leishmania
extrachromosomal amplification.
Our search on GenBank and EMBL databases showed the
existence of SIDER2 elements in other relevant Leishmania
genomic regions. For example, homology to SIDER2
sequences is found in a 44-kb genomic region, which was
involved in mitotic stability of extrachromoses in L. donovani [34]. To date, the DNA elements participating in the
chromosomal replication and segregation processes are
largely unknown in Leishmania and other trypanosomatids. The difficulty to uncover the centromeres in trypanosomatids could be pointing to the existence of holocentric
chromosomes that are characterized by the presence of a

diffuse or nonlocalized centromere during mitosis [35]. In
this scenario, SIDER2 elements should be considered as
candidates for centromeric sequences. This hypothesis is
based on two features of SIDER2 elements: they are distributed regularly along the chromosomes (Figs. 1 and 4)
and they have G+C-rich sequences. Richness in G+Csequences is observed in centromeres and pericentromic
regions of many organisms [36]. Also, it is noticeable the
existence, within the SIDER2 sequences, of G-rich tracts
that are known for their propensity to form G-quadruplex
DNA structures [37].
Finally, the presence of the "79-bp signature" in a large
proportion of the SIDER2 elements may be suggestive of

a transcriptional role for this class of repeats. In a previous
report, we have demonstrated that the "79-bp signature"
(also named Pr77), derived from T. cruzi L1Tc non-LTR
retrotransposon has a RNA-pol II-dependent promoter
that strongly activates gene transcription [38]. In this context, it may be postulated that SIDER2s bearing the "79-bp
signature" could be acting as RNA-pol II recruiting points
to enhance the transcriptional active at some chromosomal regions.

Conclusion
In this study, we describe several features of a family of
novel repeated elements (named SIDER2) that are interspersed along the different chromosomes and present in

all Leishmania species. We show an in-depth analysis of
these elements in the L. infantum chromosomes 20 and
32, and in the L. major and L. braziliensis chromosomes 32.
Apart from their proved role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in Leishmania, our analyses suggest that SIDER2 elements could be involved in DNA
amplification phenomena and, perhaps, they can represent centromeric sequences of holocentric chromosomes.
In summary, SIDER2 elements constitute a relevant piece
of the Leishmania genome organization, and this work
provides a framework for investigating the functions of
these sequences.

Methods
Parasites and DNA isolation
L. infantum JPC strain (MCAN/ES/98/LLM-724, clone
M5) was used for arrays construction. For Southern blot
analysis, the following Leishmania species were used: L.
tropica (MHOM/SU/74/K-27), L. mexicana (MNYC/BZ/
62/M-379), L. amazonensis (IFLA/BR/67/PH-8), L. braziliensis (MHOM/BR/75/M-2904) and L. major (MHOM/
IL/80/Friedlin). Promastigote forms were cultured in vitro
at 26°C in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma), supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum (Sigma).

Genomic DNA was prepared from 2 × 108 promastigotes.
After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells
were suspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (0.15 M NaCl, 0.1
M EDTA (pH 8.0) and 0.5% SDS). Afterwards, proteinase
K was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. After
incubation for 30 min at 50°C, samples were extracted
sequentially with phenol, a phenol-chloroform-isoamyl
alcohol (25:24:1) mixture and a chloroform-isoamyl
alcohol (24:1) mixture. After adding 0.1 volumes of 3 M
sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of cold ethanol, DNA
was collected by centrifugation. The pellet was suspended
in 200 μl of Te buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl and 0.1 mM
EDTA, pH 8.0) and incubated with RNAse A (20 μg/ml
final concentration) for 30 min at 37°C. Afterwards, DNA
samples were extracted with a phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) mixture, and DNA precipitated by
addition of 0.5 volumes of 7.5 M ammonium acetate and
2 volumes of cold ethanol. Finally, DNA was suspended
in 100 μl of Te buffer.
L. infantum genomic arrays
Genomic DNA macroarrays were constructed as previously described [39]. Briefly, a genomic library of Sau3AI
DNA fragments (4-kb average size) was constructed in
pBluescript KS plasmid (Promega). DNA from individual
colonies was prepared using the Perfectprep Plasmid 96
Vac kit (Eppendorf) and the BIOMEK 2000 robot
(Beckam). DNA from 575 different clones was spotted in
triplicate onto positively charged nylon membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) by NewBioTechnic (Sevilla, Spain).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/263

Before hybridizations, macroarray membranes were
washed with 0.5 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and incubated for 2 h at 65°C in 20 ml of hybridization solution
(0.5 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 7% SDS and 1 mM
EDTA). For hybridization, 350 ng of L. infantum genomic
DNA were labelled by nick-translation using 50 μCi of [α32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmole; Amersham) and standard
methods [40]. The labelled-DNA was added to the hybridization solution, and membranes were further incubated
for 12 h at 65°C. Afterwards, membranes were washed
three times with washing solution (40 mM phosphate
buffer (pH 7.2) and 0.1% SDS) for 20 min at 65°C. Radioactive signals were analyzed by a Phosphorimager (Fuji
BAS-1500).
DNA sequencing of clone pGLi5-G8g
Both strands of the insert of clone pGLi5-G8g were
sequenced using an automated sequencer (ABI Prism
3730; Applied Biosystems) by the Genomics Unit of the
Parque Científico de Madrid (SIDI-UAM). Nucleotide
sequence of this clone has been deposited at European
Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL/EBI) nucleotide
sequence database under accession number AM937229.
Identification of SIDER2 sequence elements in
Leishmania databases
An initial BLASTN search of the L. infantum database [25]
using the sequence of clone pGLi5-G8g showed that this
clone contains a genomic region from chromosome 32.
However, a subregion of approximately 550-bp was
found to be widespread along the L. infantum genome. For
the identification of these repeated sequences, now called
LiSIDER2 elements, an iterative process was followed. For
a given chromosome, sequence blocks showing sequence
identity ≥ 60% and length ≥ 100 nucleotides with pGLi5G8g sequence were considered for further analysis.
Selected sequences (plus surrounding upstream and
downstream sequences) were aligned using ClustalW. The
clustering of sequences into subfamilies was carried out
by phylogenetic analysis (see below). To determine the
extent of the elements belonging to a given subfamily, the
particular sequences were aligned with ClustalW and the
extremities determined by visual inspection of the alignment. A subfamily was defined as a group of elements
sharing sequence identity ≥ 85%. When the size of an element was clearly different to the medium size for the elements of the subfamily, it was considered as truncated
element. Each time a subfamily was identify, the sequence
of the longest member of the subfamily was used to perform additional BLASTN searches in the Leishmania databases (contig sequences, [25]), the retrieved sequences (if
new) were aligned as indicated above; the process was
repeated until no new sequences were obtained. Finally,
the remaining matches, non-assigned to any subfamily,
were considered as SIDER2 "orphan" elements. Given the

with [α-32P]dCTP by nick-translation [43]. Hybridizations
were performed as reported earlier [44].

Authors' contributions
Identification of SIDER2 elements in L. major and L. braziliensis databases [25] was performed by BLASTN
searches using representative members for the LiSIDER2
subfamilies and the orphans LiSIDER2 elements of L.
infantum chromosome 32. Each time a homologous
sequence was retrieved, it was used to perform additional
BLASTN searches in the database. The size and genomic
positions for the different LmjSIDER2 or LbSIDER2 elements were determined by sequence alignments using
ClustalW and manual corrections. Again, we restricted our
analysis
to
chromosomes
32
of
L.
major
(LmjF32_01_20050601_V5.2)
and
L.
braziliensis
(LbrM32, version 2.0).

CF, MCL and MCT carried out the different steps of macroarrays construction. CF performed hybridization of
macroarrays, PCR amplification and Southern blotting.
JMR conceived the project, supervised the experiments
and performed the bioinformatics analyses. MCL and
MCT helped to draft the manuscript. CF prepared the final
version of figures. JMR wrote the final version of the manuscript. All authors have read and approved the final manuscript.

Other databases mining
The different LiSIDER2 elements found in L. infantum
chromosome 32 were used for BLASTN searches in T. brucei and T. cruzi databases [25]. Also, BLAST searches were
performed in GenBank and EMBL databases.
DNA probes and Southern blot analysis
LiSIDER2-32-121058r and LiSIDER2-20-575257d elements were PCR amplified using as template genomic
DNA from L. infantum JPC strain. As primers, the following oligonucleotides were used: LiRS-32-Ad (5'CCGCCCCGAAATATAAGT-3') and LiRS-32-Ar (5'GCCTCCATGCGCGGTGTC-3')
for
LiSIDER2-32121058r; 20R-d (5'-CCACATCGCGCGTGGCGC-3') and
20R-r (5'-TGACGTGTGGACCCCGCT-3') for LiSIDER220-575257d. The amplification products were cloned into
the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen), yielding clones pLiRS-32A
(LiSIDER2-32-121058r) and pLiRS-20Q (LiSIDER2-20575257d). The authenticity of clones and the fidelity of
the PCR-amplification were verified by nucleotide
sequencing.
