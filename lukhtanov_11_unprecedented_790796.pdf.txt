Unprecedented within-species chromosome
number cline in the Wood White butterfly
Leptidea sinapis and its significance for
karyotype evolution and speciation

Abstract
Background: Species generally have a fixed number of chromosomes in the cell nuclei while between-species
differences are common and often pronounced. These differences could have evolved through multiple speciation
events, each involving the fixation of a single chromosomal rearrangement. Alternatively, marked changes in the
karyotype may be the consequence of within-species accumulation of multiple chromosomal fissions/fusions,
resulting in highly polymorphic systems with the subsequent extinction of intermediate karyomorphs. Although
this mechanism of chromosome number evolution is possible in theory, it has not been well documented.
Results: We present the discovery of exceptional intraspecific variability in the karyotype of the widespread
Eurasian butterfly Leptidea sinapis. We show that within this species the diploid chromosome number gradually
decreases from 2n = 106 in Spain to 2n = 56 in eastern Kazakhstan, resulting in a 6000 km-wide cline that
originated recently (8,500 to 31,000 years ago). Remarkably, intrapopulational chromosome number polymorphism
exists, the chromosome number range overlaps between some populations separated by hundreds of kilometers,
and chromosomal heterozygotes are abundant. We demonstrate that this karyotypic variability is intraspecific
because in L. sinapis a broad geographical distribution is coupled with a homogenous morphological and genetic
structure.
Conclusions: The discovered system represents the first clearly documented case of explosive chromosome
number evolution through intraspecific and intrapopulation accumulation of multiple chromosomal changes.
Leptidea sinapis may be used as a model system for studying speciation by means of chromosomally-based
suppressed recombination mechanisms, as well as clinal speciation, a process that is theoretically possible but
difficult to document. The discovered cline seems to represent a narrow time-window of the very first steps of
species formation linked to multiple chromosomal changes that have occurred explosively. This case offers a rare
opportunity to study this process before drift, dispersal, selection, extinction and speciation erase the traces of
microevolutionary events and just leave the final picture of a pronounced interspecific chromosomal difference.

Background
Despite the fundamental role of chromosomal change in
eukaryotic evolution, the mechanisms related to this
process are still poorly known. Main karyotypic features
of organisms, such as the number of chromosomes, are
usually stable within species [1,2]. This stability is in
good correspondence with the fact that new chromosomal rearrangements usually originate as heterozygotes
and are often - although not always - associated with
heterozygote disadvantage (=negative heterosis; =underdominance). Therefore, their spread to fixation within a
large population has low probability [2]. At the same
time, differences in karyotype characters between species, including diploid chromosome number (2n), are
extremely common. Numerous cases of extraordinary
differences in chromosome number, especially in plants,
are due to polyploidy [3]. Even when excluding polyploidy, interspecific variation remains very frequent, and
many closely related species often have substantially different chromosome numbers. In metazoan animals, the
greatest range of within-genus karyotype variation not
related to polyploidy is found in Agrodiaetus blue butterflies, where diploid chromosome number ranges
between species from 2n = 20 to 2n = 268 in spite of
morphological similarity and very recent time of species
divergence [4]. Interestingly, Agrodiaetus also tends to
demonstrate the greatest karyotype difference between
very closely related species, e.g. sister species A. biruni
and A. posthumus have 2n = 20 and 2n = 180 respectively with no intermediates between them.
In vertebrates, the range of chromosome number variation between closely related species is smaller, yet still
impressive. For example, the analysis of 11 species of
the catfish genus Corydoras revealed that they have karyotypes ranging from 2n = 44 to 2n = 102 [5]. The
tuco-tucos, South American rodents of the genus Ctenomys, show chromosomal variation with diploid numbers varying from 2n = 10 to 2n = 70 among the 60
species described [6]. The deer genus Muntiacus
includes species with different karyotypes, ranging from
2n = 6 to 2n = 46 [7]. In plants, the greatest range of
within-genus karyotype variation not related to polyploidy is found in Carex, where diploid chromosome
number ranges from 2n = 12 to 2n = 132 [8].
The discrepancy between intra- and interspecific
variability in chromosome numbers poses a serious evolutionary problem. How can numerous species with
extremely diverse karyotypes evolve in a relatively short
period of time, if major chromosomal rearrangements
changing the number of chromosomes are mostly
underdominant and, consequently, intraspecific variations are rare and their range is limited?
One possible explanation is that extremely different
chromosome numbers evolve gradually through multiple

Page 2 of 11

speciation/raciation events, each involving the fixation
of a single (or few) chromosomal rearrangement(s), and
followed by the subsequent extinction of species or
races with intermediate karyotypes. This step-by-step
mechanism of karyotype evolution seems to be common
in nature, and its initial phase can be observed in some
chromosomally polymorphic organisms such as the
mouse Mus musculus domesticus and the shrew Sorex
araneus [9-13]. It has been recently demonstrated that
the reduction in fertility of hybrids between the house
mouse races separated by fixed monobrachial differences
is not so pronounced as previously supposed [14].
Nevertheless, this study generally supported the chromosomally-based monobrachial speciation model as a
process that accelerates the acquisition of reproductive
isolation in the house mouse [14]. In the step-by-step
process, the transitional forms are expected to demonstrate a chromosomal fusion/fission polymorphism and,
accordingly, numerous examples are known where single or few chromosomal fusions exist in the polymorphic phase, e.g., Robertsonian fusions in Drosophila
americana [15], melanopline grasshoppers [16] and
rodents of the genus Ctenomys [6,17].
An alternative hypothesis is that dramatic changes in
chromosome number appear as a consequence of a
within-species accumulation of numerous chromosomal
rearrangements, resulting in highly polymorphic systems
with the subsequent extinction of intermediate karyomorphs. A necessary precondition for this mechanism is
that major chromosomal rearrangements changing the
number of chromosomes are not strongly underdominant. This seems to hold true for different groups such
as butterflies, flies, grasshoppers, spiders, fishes and
mammals [6,15-25].
While the within-species mechanism of explosive
chromosome number evolution is possible in theory, it
has been less well documented compared to the evolution through multiple speciation/raciation events. In
practice, it is difficult to record such an extensive
within-species accumulation for two reasons. First, the
transition from one chromosomal form to another may
be very fast compared to the species lifespan. The only
exception is the chromosomal evolution operated by
balancing selection. However, this mechanism seems to
be rare, except in the case of inversions [[26,27], but see
[28]]. Second, even if polymorphism for multiple chromosomal rearrangements is found, it may be difficult to
distinguish between a polymorphic system primarily
evolved within a species and a polymorphism resulting
from hybridization between different, chromosomally
diverged species. For example, in the hybridization
zones between low and high chromosome number species of the rodent genus Ellobius, there is a so-called
“chromosomal fan” including all chromosome numbers

from 2n = 31 to 2n = 54 [29]. In fact, this case does not
represent evidence for within-species accumulation of
chromosomal changes, but simply represents the outcome of secondary parapatry by previously isolated
chromosomal races.
Furthermore, the clinal geographical distribution of
chromosomal races observed in some organisms [1,2],
apparently compatible with gradual within-species accumulation of chromosomal changes, may be better
explained by the multiple speciation mechanism. For
example, in butterflies of the Erebia tyndarus complex
there are several geographically isolate chromosomal
races (chromosome numbers ranging from 2n = 16 to
2n = 102) [30], and in fossorial mole rats of the Spalax
ehrenbergi complex four linearly distributed chromosomal races exist (from 2n = 52 to 2n = 60) [31]. In these
cases, intrapopulation chromosomal polymorphism is
absent and differences between neighbouring chromosomal races, although minor, are fixed. Detailed molecular
and morphological studies provide evidence for nonconspecificity of the E. tyndarus and S. ehrenbergi
forms, and several distinct species were identified and
formally described [32,33].
In this study we describe a chromosomal cline in the
Wood White butterfly, Leptidea sinapis (Insecta, Lepidoptera, Pieridae) that provides strong evidence for
rapid and extensive within-species chromosome number
evolution through accumulation of multiple chromosomal changes. This cline is exceptional in the geographic
area that it covers (6000 km) and in its range of withinspecies chromosome number variation (2n = 56-106).
Excluding polyploidy, this is the widest known withinspecies chromosome number range for any animal or
plant, and it is comparable with the highest known level
of within-genus karyotype variability.

Results and Discussion
We analyzed the karyotype, mitochondrial and nuclear
genetic markers, and the morphology of the Wood
White butterfly L. sinapis. This is a common species
widely distributed from Portugal and Spain in the west
to Siberia in the east [34]. From this territory different
chromosome numbers have been reported in literature
ranging from n = 28 to n = 41 [35]. However, these
results are impossible to interpret in practice because of
the discovery in 1993 of a cryptic sympatric species (L.
reali) in Europe and Asia [36]. As all karyotype data for
L. sinapis were published before this date, it is unclear
whether reported chromosome numbers reflect inter- or
intraspecific variability.
Our study covers populations from different parts of
the L. sinapis distribution (Figures 1, 2), as well as the
closely related species L. reali and L. morsei as comparison. We discovered that diploid chromosome number

Page 3 of 11

ranges in L. sinapis from 2n = 106 in Spain to 2n = 56 in
eastern Kazakhstan in a longitudinal cline (Figure 1a; for
more details, see Additional file 1). These findings are
based on the examination of 209 male specimens, with
metaphase plates observed in 35 individuals, out of which
23 had unambiguous chromosome number counts (Spain
- 4, France - 2, Italy - 2, Romania - 8, Kazakhstan - 7).
We also found that chromosome numbers are not stable
within some populations from Italy, Romania and
Kazakhstan. Specimens with different chromosome numbers were found within each of these populations, and
the great majority of the individuals were chromosomal
heterozygotes displaying from one to six multivalents in
metaphase I of meiosis (Additional file 1, Figure S1). In
the heterozygotes, we observed no abnormalities in the
anaphase I stage of meiosis, and the first division of
meiosis resulted in normal haploid metaphase II cells
where, as expected, two types of metaphase plates with
different chromosome numbers were observed. Therefore
we conclude that chromosomal rearrangements are not
fixed in several of the populations studied, and there
seems to be no strong selection against chromosomal
heterozygotes. Interestingly, chromosome number range
overlaps between some studied populations separated by
hundreds of kilometers, e.g. in Kazakhstan between the
population from Landman (2n = 56-61) and the population from Saur (2n = 56-64).
In certain species, variation in chromosome number
may be caused by the presence of so-called B-chromosomes (=additional chromosomes, =supernumerary chromosomes) [37]. B-chromosomes consist mainly of
repetitive DNA and can be usually found in low numbers
(one to five) in a percentage of the individuals of a given
population. Although they are dispensable, they can
sometimes accumulate through processes of mitotic or
meiotic drive [38]. B-chromosomes can be distinguished
from normal A-chromosomes because they are usually
smaller and can be seen as additional chromosomes present in only some of the individuals in a population. The
best diagnostic feature is their identity at meiosis, where
they may be found as univalents, or in various pairing
configurations (bivalents or multivalents), but never pairing with A-chromosomes. Thus, meiotic analysis is critical to distinguish between B-chromosomes and normal
A-chromosomes [37,38]. Although we cannot totally
exclude that B-chromosomes can be found in L. sinapis,
especially taking into account that they are known in
other genera of the family Pieridae [39], there is good evidence that B-chromosomes are not a valid explanation
for the chromosome number cline found in L. sinapis.
This is due to the fact that in the Spanish population,
where the number of chromosomes is maximal (and correspondingly where the highest number of B-chromosomes would be expected), they seem to be completely

absent: the chromosome number is stable within as well
as between individuals, and no univalents have been
observed during meiosis. Moreover, no univalents have
been observed during meiosis in any of the other populations studied. Additionally, the following clear pattern
was observed: the higher the chromosome numbers in a
population, the smaller the size of chromosomes, and
vice versa (Figure 1; Additional file 1, Figure S1). This
regularity indicates that chromosomal fusions/fissions
(but not B-chromosomes) were the main mechanism of
karyotype evolution.
Leptidea sinapis can be distinguished from its closest
relative L. reali by the length of the phallus, saccus and
vinculum (in male genitalia) or of the ductus bursae (in
female genitalia) [36,40] as well as by molecular markers
[41,42]. Therefore, to exclude the possibility of cryptic species involved in the formation of the extraordinarily high
chromosomal variability and to demonstrate the conspecificity of the populations studied, we performed morphological and molecular analysis of each studied individual.
The measured variables of the male genitalia showed
no significant difference or apparent trend between
chromosomal races according to one-way ANOVA (Figure 2a, b) and to discriminant analysis (DA) (Figure 2c).
100% of the L. reali were correctly classified to species
with the DA, but within L. sinapis, between 0 (France
and Italy) and 62.5% (Kazakhstan) of specimens were
correctly assigned to region (Additional file 1, Table S1).

uncorrected p distance of 0.61% for COI, 0.7% for CAD
and 0.16% for ITS2) suggesting the absence of cryptic
species (Figures 1b-d and Figure 3). The COI haplotype

connection steps are only four, and that the most common haplotype is found in all the studied regions. The
observed genetic variability is rather low for an almost
pan-Palaearctic species (e.g. [42,43]), even more so since
L. sinapis is considered a non-migratory poor flyer. The
fact that the same low variability is shown by several
independent markers rejects a recent mitochondrial
genetic sweep and strongly suggests a very recent geographic expansion. Coalescence-based dating with each
marker and with all the markers combined estimates
that the time to the most recent common ancestor of all
the populations is only 8,500 to 31,000 years. Thus, we
conclude that there is no evidence for multiple species
involved in the formation of the discovered cline, and
that its origin is very recent.
It is known that in some systems, variation in chromosome number may be a result of ongoing hybridization between different, chromosomally diverged species
[29]. Therefore, the chromosome number variability discovered may be a consequence of hybridization between
L. sinapis and its sibling species L. reali. This explanation may seem possible given that the presence of putative F 1 hybrids between L. sinapis and L. reali was
suggested [44]. However, these results [44] were based
on some apparent mismatches between DNA-based
identifications (which were congruent for RAPD markers and COI) and morphometry of the male genitalia.
The classification of the sequenced specimens based on
their genitalia was made by employing a bivariate plot,
which took into account only the lengths of the phallus
and saccus. A recent comprehensive morphometrical
study on L. sinapis and L. reali from Central Italy [40]
highlighted the limitation of the “phallus and saccus”
approach, which can lead to ambiguous classifications.
The same study showed that this limitation can be corrected when using additional genitalic characters (especially the vinculum width) and performing multivariate
analyses. Therefore, the report of possible hybrids
between L. reali and L. sinapis requires confirmation
since it may actually represent an artifact caused by the
interpretation of insufficient morphological traits. Moreover, in case of interspecific hybridization we can expect
that some individuals would be heterozygous for species-specific nuclear molecular markers and specimens
with intermediate morphology of genitalia should be
found. None of the specimens studied in our work has
shown these characteristics (see above). Due to genitalic
morphological constraints between the two species,
introgression is likely to be unidirectional with female L.
sinapis potentially inseminated by male L. reali [36,44].
Finally, several studies dealing with the mating behaviour of L. sinapis and L. reali reported that females of
both species exclusively mated with conspecific males,
suggesting the presence of strong precopulatory barriers

Page 6 of 11

[36,45,46]. Therefore, we can conclude that interspecific
hybridization is an unlikely explanation for the origin of
the discovered chromosomal cline.
The clinal distribution of chromosome numbers in L.
sinapis is statistically significant (p < 0.0001) and it is
very unlikely to have arisen by chance (Figure 4). Interestingly, the cline is longitudinally oriented (Figure 1a),
indicating either the direction of selective pressure
involved in its formation, or the direction of population
dispersal, or both of these processes. According to our
dating, the moment of this dispersal would correspond
to the upper Pleistocene and the Holocene, a period
characterized by a strong glaciation in northern Europe
and the Alps [47]. Thus, our estimates indicate that the
dispersal of L. sinapis could have occurred before or
after the last glacial maximum (24,000 to 17,000 years
ago).
Several other cases of broad intraspecific chromosomal
polymorphism have been described in animals
[6,18-21,23,24,48-56] and plants [8,57]. However, all
these cases differ from the cline found in L. sinapis by
the essentially smaller range of karyotype variability and
by the possible existence of two or more cryptic species
involved in the formation of the polymorphic chromosomal system. In order to demonstrate the intraspecific
nature of karyotype variability, the following three criteria should be met simultaneously: 1) segregating chromosomal polymorphism within a population should be
demonstrated, 2) molecular markers should not suggest
the presence of potential cryptic species, and 3) species-

correlated with longitude according to a linear function (r = 0.826;
p < 0.0001). Results based on 23 specimens with unambiguous
chromosome number counts (Spain - 4, France - 2, Italy - 2,
Romania - 8, Kazakhstan - 7).

Lukhtanov et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:109

diagnostic morphological differences should be lacking.
To our knowledge, only studies on the common shrew
and the house mouse have met all these criteria, but
chromosomal races within these mammals have essentially smaller differences in chromosome number and
apparently evolved through a step-by-step accumulation
of single chromosomal rearrangements [9-13] rather
than through wide intraspecific and intrapopulation
chromosome number polymorphism.

Conclusions
Given that (a) chromosomal races of L. sinapis belong to
the same species, (b) intrapopulation chromosome number polymorphism exists, (c) the chromosome number
range overlaps between some populations separated by
hundreds of kilometers, (d) the species has broad ecological preferences and is widely distributed, (e) the species has a rather homogenous genetic structure, and (f)
chromosomal heterozygotes are abundant, this represents a clearly documented case of rapid and massive
within-species accumulation of multiple chromosomal
rearrangements affecting the number of chromosomes.
The chromosomal rearrangements discovered in our
investigation display segregating polymorphism that
seems not to strongly affect reproductive fitness within
the populations studied. However, these rearrangements
are not necessarily irrelevant to the process of formation
of reproductive isolation (i.e. to speciation). It is well
known that Robertsonian rearrangements (i.e. nonreciprocal translocations involving fission and fusion at or
near a centromere), have the potential to limit gene flow
and drive speciation [58,59]. The Wood White butterfly,
like other Lepidoptera and some other insects, has holokinetic chromosomes in which the centromere is not
localized and centromeric activity is distributed along
the length of the chromosome [35,60-62]. It has been
recently demonstrated that fusions/fissions of holokinetic chromosomes restrict gene flow too, and that this
effect is cumulative (i.e. increases proportionally with
the level of chromosomal differences) [57]. In the case
of L. sinapis all evidence suggests that neighbour populations with relatively low differences in chromosome
number are reproductively compatible. We cannot
exclude that geographically distant and chromosomally
divergent populations would display reduced fertility if
crossed, although they are connected by a chain of compatible populations that should allow gene flow. Therefore, the discovered system opens the possibility to
study clinal speciation, a process that is theoretically
possible but difficult to document [[63], pages 113-123].
Chromosomal rearrangements are known to limit
introgression in parapatry or sympatry with regard to
isolation genes, thus facilitating the maintenance of incipient species boundaries [64,65], and serving as regions

Page 7 of 11

where isolation genes can accumulate [15,27,66-68]. The
preservation and/or accumulation of isolation genes protected by chromosomal rearrangements could represent
a prerequisite for speciation by means of suppressedrecombination mechanisms [15,27,64-68].
In conclusion, the L. sinapis chromosomal cline seems
to represent a narrow time-window of the very first
steps of species formation linked to multiple chromosomal changes that have occurred explosively. This case
offers a rare opportunity to study this process before
drift, dispersal, selection, extinction and speciation erase
the traces of microevolutionary events and just leave the
final picture of a pronounced interspecific chromosomal
difference.

Methods
Note: During the publication process of this paper it has
been shown that the Romanian specimens of L. reali
used here as outgroup actually belong to a new cryptic
species named Leptidea juvernica [69].
Sample collecting

Fresh male Leptidea specimens (Additional file 1, Table
S2) were collected with the insect net and were kept
alive in glassine envelopes. In the laboratory, butterflies
were killed by pressing the thorax and testes were
removed from the abdomen and immediately placed
into a 0.5 ml vial with freshly prepared Carnoy fixative
(ethanol and glacial acetic acid, 3:1). Bodies were placed
into a 2 ml plastic vial with 100% ethanol for DNA analysis and wings were stored in glassine envelopes. Each
sample has been assigned a unique sample ID. All the
samples are stored in Roger Vila’s DNA and Tissues
Collection in Barcelona, Spain.
Genitalia preparation and morphometric analyses

Male genitalia were prepared according to the following
protocol: maceration for 15 minutes at 95°C in 10%
potassium hydroxide, dissection and cleaning under a
stereomicroscope and storage in tubes with glycerin.
Genitalia were photographed laterally (Figure 2c), without being pressed, in a thin layer of distilled water
under a Carl Zeiss Stemi 2000-C stereomicroscope
equipped with a DeltaPix Invenio 3S digital camera.
Measurements were performed based on the digital
photographs by using AxioVision software. A total of 73
specimens of L. sinapis were included in the morphometrical analyses (Additional file 1, Table S3). These
included 35 of the karyotyped samples, and 38 individuals collected in the same locality and moment for
which the cytogenetic studies did not produce results.
In addition, five specimens of the sibling L. reali were
added as outgroup. Three elements of the male genitalia
were measured: phallus, saccus and vinculum width.

These are the best diagnostic characters to separate L.
sinapis from L. reali [40]. The vinculum width was used
to normalize the size of the specimen.
StatView 5.0.1 (SAS Institute Inc., 1992-1998) was
used to perform one-way ANOVA in order to test for
differences in the length of the phallus and saccus, each
normalized by the width of the vinculum, between
regions for L. sinapis, and between L. sinapis and L.
reali. All variables were normally distributed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, p > 0.05). The software SPSS 14.0
was used to perform a discriminant analysis by employing the stepwise method. The Box’s M test was used to
evaluate the homogeneity of covariance assumption (p >
0.05). The variables were selected with the Wilks’
lambda statistic, which measures how each function
separates cases into groups. In order to test the obtained
classification a cross validation was carried out.

spermatocyte cells, and consequently to analyze the
structure of the bivalents and multivalents.
In total, preparations from 209 males were analyzed. As
cell divisions are extremely rare in Leptidea during imago
stage [76], metaphase plates were observed in only 35
individuals (Additional file 1, Table S2). These individuals
were also used for morphological and molecular analysis.

Karyotype analyses

Specimen sequencing

Gonads were stored in Carnoy fixative (ethanol and glacial acetic acid, 3:1) for 2-6 months at 4ï‚°C and then
stained with 2% acetic orcein for 30 days at 20ï‚°C as it
was previously described [70,71].
Chromosomes of butterflies (Lepidoptera) are small,
numerous and uniform in both shape and size [35].
They lack a distinct primary constriction (the centromere) and are regarded as holokinetic with kinetochores
extended over a large portion of the chromosome surface [60]. The uniformity of lepidopteran chromosomes,
the absence of morphological markers such as the centromeres and the lack of convenient differential banding
techniques [61] make difficult the identification of individual chromosomes by standard cytogenetic methods.
Although new approaches to individual identification of
the Lepidoptera chromosomes based on the fluorescent
in situ hybridization (FISH) technique have been
recently elaborated [72-74], they are applicable only for
studying species bred in the laboratory. For this reason,
the chromosome number remains the most commonly
used karyotypic character in Lepidoptera cytogenetics
and karyosystematics. In our study we counted the
diploid chromosome numbers (2n) in mitotic spermatogonial cells and the haploid chromosome numbers (n)
in metaphase II of male meiosis. We also counted the
number of chromosomal elements (n) (bivalents + multivalents) in metaphase I of male meiosis. In the last
case, the number of chromosomal elements was equal
to the haploid number (n) if all the elements were
represented by bivalents, or less if some elements were
represented by multivalents. To distinguish between
bivalents and multivalents, we used a special method
[75]. Briefly, by varying the pressure on the coverslip,
we were able to manipulate chromosomes, e.g. change
their position and orientation in intact (not squashed)

Total genomic DNA was extracted using Chelex 100
resin, 100-200 mesh, sodium form (Biorad), under the
following protocol: one leg was removed and introduced
into 100 μl of Chelex 10% and 5 μl of Proteinase K (20
mg/ml) were added. The samples were incubated overnight at 55°C, afterwards were incubated at 100°C for 15
minutes and were subsequently centrifuged for 10 seconds at 3000 rpm.
A 676 bp fragment at the 5’ end of the mitochondrial
gene cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) was amplified
by polymerase chain reaction using the primers LCO
1490 (5’-GGTCAACAAATCATAAAGATATTGG-3’)
[77] and Nancy (5’-CCCGGTAAAATTAAAATATAAACTTC-3’) [78]. When these primers failed, we
used the primers LepF1 (5’-ATTCAACCAATCATAAAGATATTGG-3’) and LepR1 (5’-TAAACTTCTGGATGTCCAAAAAATCA-3’) [79], which amplified a
658 bp fragment of COI. Double-stranded DNA was
amplified in 25 μl volume reactions: 13.22 μl ultra pure
(HPLC quality) water, 2.5 μl 10× buffer, 4.5 μl 25 mM
MgCl2, 0.25 μl 100 mM dNTP, 1.2 μl of each primer
(10 mM), 0.13 μl Taq DNA Gold Polymerase (Qiagen)
and 2 μl of extracted DNA. The typical thermal cycling
profile was: 95°C for 60 seconds, 44°C for 60 seconds
and 72°C for 90 seconds, for 40 cycles. A total of 70 L.
sinapis samples were successfully sequenced for this
marker. These included 34 of the karyotyped samples,
and 36 individuals collected in the same locality as the
karyotyped samples. Five L. reali and two L. morsei specimens were also sequenced and used as outgroup.
A 571 bp fragment at the 5’ end of the nuclear gene
CAD was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using
the primers CADFa (5’-GDATGGTYGATGAAAATGTTAA-3’) and CADRa (5’- CTCATRTCGTAATCYGTRCT-3’) (designed by A. Kaliszewska). Double-stranded

Geographical longitude vs. chromosome number

Pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess the
degree of association between haploid karyotype and
geographical longitude. Longitude was measured in decimal degrees and only 23 samples with unambiguous
chromosome number counts were included (see Additional file 1, Table S4). If the specimen showed different
chromosome numbers in different cells, the average
between the different chromosome numbers was used.

DNA was amplified in 25 μl volume reactions: 16.65 μl
ultra pure (HPLC quality) water, 2.5 μl 10× buffer, 1 μl
100 mM MgCl2, 0.25 μl 100 mM dNTP, 1.2 μl of each primer (10 mM), 0.2 μl Taq DNA Polymerase (Bioron,
GmbH) and 2 μl of extracted DNA. The typical thermal
cycling profile was: 95°C for 60 seconds, 48°C for 60 seconds and 72°C for 90 seconds, for 40 cycles. A total of 14
samples (all karyotyped) were sequenced for this marker.
Three L. reali and two L. morsei specimens were also
sequenced and used as outgroup.
A 684 bp fragment at the 5’ end of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the primers ITS3 (5’GCATCGATGAAGAACGCAGC-3’) and ITS4 (5’TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3’) [80]. Doublestranded DNA was amplified in 25 μl volume reactions:
16.7 μl ultra pure (HPLC quality) water, 2.5 μl 10× buffer, 1 μl 100 mM MgCl2, 0.25 μl 100 mM dNTP, 1.2 μl
of each primer (10 mM), 0.15 μl Taq DNA Polymerase
(Bioron, GmbH) and 2 μl of extracted DNA. The typical
thermal cycling profile was: 95°C for 45 seconds, 47°C
for 60 seconds and 72°C for 60 seconds, for 40 cycles. A
total of 14 samples (all karyotyped) were sequenced for
this marker. Three L. reali and two L. morsei specimens
were also sequenced and used as outgroup. PCR products were purified and sequenced by Macrogen Inc.
(Seoul, Korea). Sequences obtained specifically for this
study were deposited in GenBank (accession numbers
indicated in Additional file 1, Table S2).

independently for COI, ITS2 and CAD haplotypes under
a Coalescent model with constant population size. Duplicate haplotypes were removed from the matrix using Collapse 1.2 [82]. A lognormal distribution (Mean = 0.15,
Stdev = 0.798) was used assuming a maximum possible
limit of 405000 years as the 95% HPD of the distribution,
trying to let the maximum exploratory space to MCMC
runs. To estimate this prior, we used the maximum COI
intraspecific divergence for L. sinapis under a rather slow
invertebrate mitochondrial substitution rate: 1.5% uncorrected pairwise distance per million years [89]. Since substitution rates are known to overestimate ages for recent
lineages still under the coalescence process, we are certain that 405000 years is a good maximum estimate for
the TMRCA of this species. The dataset was analyzed
using the HKY model and applying a strict molecular
clock along the branches. Base frequencies were estimated and a randomly generated initial tree was used.
Parameters were estimated using two independent runs
of 10 million generations each (with a pre-run burn-in of
100,000 generations) to ensure convergence, checked
with the program Tracer v1.4.
A multi-locus approach with *BEAST [90] was also
employed to check the results with a smaller set of 12
samples, including those with most divergent COI haplotypes. In order to study the effect of the outgroup,
COI and multilocus analyses were conducted by both
including and excluding L. reali haplotypes (Additional
file 1, Table S5).

Sequence alignment and phylogenetic inference

Additional material

COI, ITS2 and CAD sequences were edited and aligned
using Geneious Pro 4.7.5 [81]. These resulted in three
final alignments of 658 bp and 77 specimens for COI,
571 bp and 19 specimens for CAD, and 684 bp and 19
specimens for ITS2. For COI, duplicate haplotypes were
removed using Collapse 1.2 [82]. Maximum Likelihood
(ML) phylogenetic trees were inferred for CAD, ITS2
and COI using Phyml 2.4.4 [83], with the nucleotide
substitution model HKY [84] for nuclear markers and
HKY+I for COI, as suggested by jModeltest 0.1 [85],
and 100 bootstrap replicates.
Haplotype network

In order to examine relationships among haplotypes, a
maximum parsimony haplotype network was constructed using TCS 1.21 [86]. The haplotype network
was built with a 99% parsimony connection limit. The
network presented one loop, which was broken according to frequency and geographic criteria [87].
Estimation of TMRCA

Time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of
L. sinapis was inferred with BEAST v.1.5.3 [88]
