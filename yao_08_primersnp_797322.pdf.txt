Abstract
Background: The increasing number of genomic sequences of bacteria makes it possible to select
unique SNPs of a particular strain/species at the whole genome level and thus design specific
primers based on the SNPs. The high similarity of genomic sequences among phylogeneticallyrelated bacteria requires the identification of the few loci in the genome that can serve as unique
markers for strain differentiation. PrimerSNP attempts to identify reliable strain-specific markers,
on which specific primers are designed for pathogen detection purpose.
Results: PrimerSNP is an online tool to design primers based on strain specific SNPs for multiple
strains/species of microorganisms at the whole genome level. The allele-specific primers could
distinguish query sequences of one strain from other homologous sequences by standard PCR
reaction. Additionally, PrimerSNP provides a feature for designing common primers that can
amplify all the homologous sequences of multiple strains/species of microorganisms. PrimerSNP is
freely available at http://cropdisease.ars.usda.gov/~primer.
Conclusion: PrimerSNP is a high-throughput specific primer generation tool for the
differentiation of phylogenetically-related strains/species. Experimental validation showed that this
software had a successful prediction rate of 80.4 – 100% for strain specific primer design.

Background
Clinical and environmental microbiology often requires
the detection of a particular bacterial strain with/without

the presence of other closely related strains/species in the
samples [1]. Standard PCR is by far the most efficient
method in pathogen detection and disease epidemiology

research. The critical part of this method is the specific
primer design. The challenge of the primer design is that
PCR primers are being designed to amplify from one
sequence, but not from other homologous sequences. The
general approach of specific primer design by biologists is
often performed manually by searching primer sequences
against a DNA database, followed by experimental tests.
However, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs),
which represent micro but stable DNA variations, are difficult to analyze through regular BLAST searches and are
often ignored while designing specific primers. Further,
manually designing genome-wide primers based on
sequence alignments can be challenging if strains have
low sequence variability. An effective approach to process
such a large amount of genomic data requires computational tools that are capable of processing large amounts
of data and yet are easy to handle.
Although a large number of primer design programs are
available, very few packages are available for allele-specific primer design. Primer Premier from Premier Biosoft
International has an allele-specific PCR primer design
function but it is a commercial package which is not free
to the public. Primo [2], Primique [3] and Amplicon [4]
are both free to the public but they require either userdefined homologous genes or sequence alignment files.
All these software do not support batch design for multiple query sequences of a particular strain/species. None of
these programs take into consideration the whole genome
sequences of the non-target strains when designing specific primers. Therefore, the primers' specificity needs to
be further improved before they can be used for detection.
In this paper, we describe a new software program, PrimerSNP, which designs strain-specific primers that can specifically amplify the genomic sequences of a particular
bacterium strain but not the genomic sequences of other
phylogenetically-related strains. It automatically identifies unique SNPs of the strain and design primers based
on these unique SNPs. It also quantifies the primer specificity by calculating a weight score, which takes into
account both the number and location of SNPs on the
primers.
Although PrimerSNP is initially developed to design specific primers, a second function is also added, which
designs common primers that could amplify all the
homologous genes. Similar programs for common primer
design exist such as GeneFisher [5], but this program does
not support the batch design of primers.
Compared to currently available software, PrimerSNP
reduces users' involvement to a minimum level: only
uploading of multiple genomic sequences is required. It
can automatically search for unique SNPs from the input

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/185

genomic sequences. Importantly, this software has a high
successful prediction rate (>80%) as validated by our
experiments.
For user's convenience, a windows version of this software
is prepared and can be downloaded from the main page.

Implementation
PrimerSNP is built around other public domain programs, such as BLAST [6], ClustalW2 [7], me-PCR [8] and
Primer3 [9]. Implementation of PrimerSNP is shown in
Figure 1. Panel A shows the flowchart of specific primer
design (SPEC) and panel B shows the flowchart of common primer design (COMN).
The SPEC subprogram consists of the following steps:
1. Extract homologous regions of each query sequence
using BLAST search against all the reference genomic
sequences. Multiple sequence alignment of these
sequences is made with ClustalW2.
2. Identify unique SNPs and generate candidate primers.
Based on the multiple sequence alignment file, SNPs that
are unique to the query sequence are next identified. A
SNP is defined as unique if it is specific only to the query
sequence (Figure 2). Using each SNP as the 3' end base, a
series of sequences to the left and right of the SNP are
selected as either candidate left or right primers (Figure 3).
3. All the candidate primers generated in the previous step
are evaluated using Primer3 based on the user-defined
PCR parameters. If a candidate primer is appropriate, the
second half primer is generated by Primer3, if possible.
4. Calculate the weight score and free energy of melting
(ΔG°) of primer-DNA duplex. The weight score is a measurement of the number and the locations of SNPs in the
designed primer pair. A weight score of a specific primer
pair is calculated for the first 15 nucleotides as shown in
Figure 4A. A score of 2(15 – n) is assigned to a base if it is a
SNP and its position is n (starting from 3' to 5' end). The
weight score of a primer pair is the sum of all the score values of SNPs on the primer sequences. In addition to
weight score, the free energy of melting (ΔG°) is also calculated. This thermodynamic parameter is often used to
estimate nucleic acid stability [10]. To calculate ΔG° of
the primer-DNA duplex, we used the improved thermodynamic nearest-neighbor model [11].
5. Checking the primer specificity. A primer pair is defined
as specific if it satisfies the following conditions: a) The
primer pair has a perfect match with the target genome
sequence only once; b) both left and the right primer do
not show consecutive nucleotide matches of more than

eight (default value of Maximum Perfect Match (MPM),
can be user-defined) base pairs (starting from 3' to the 5'
end) with the reference genomes simultaneously; and c)
in case of the second condition is not satisfied, the amplicon size should be greater than 3,000 bp (default value of
Minimum Amplicon Size (MAS), Figure 5).
6. Sort output primers. The primer pairs are sorted in the
descending order of the weight score. The program output
format is similar to Primer3 with the additional parameters of weight score and ΔG°. A graphic view of the loca-

tions of the primers and their SNPs within the multiple
sequence alignment file is also provided (Figure 6).
The COMN subprogram consists of the following steps:
1. Extract homologous sequences for each query
sequence.
2. Generate primers for each query sequence using
Primer3 according to the user defined PCR parameters.
3. Select those primer pairs that have perfect match with
all the other homologous sequences.
4. Calculate the weight score, which is the difference
between the amplicon size of the possible PCR product
and the optimum product size (Figure 4B). For each query
sequence, the primer pair whose amplicon size is closest
to the optimum product size is selected.

Results
Common primer design
Forty pairs of primers were designed for 40 homologous
genes among the four strains (Temecula-1, 9a5c, Dixon
and Ann1) of Xylella fastidiosa. The experimental validation result showed that all the 40 common primers successfully amplified the corresponding homologous
sequences on each of the strains (data not shown).
Specific primer design
To design strain-specific primers, 2,766 genes of strain
9a5c, 2,622 genes of strain Dixon, 2,034 genes of strain
Temecula-1 and 2,815 genes of strain Ann-1 were used as
the input query sequences for specific primer design.
When one strain was used as the target, the genome
sequences of the other three were used as the reference.
These gene and genomic sequences were downloaded
from
http://cropdisease.ars.usda.gov/CVC_index.htm.
Except for PCR product length which is set at 100 – 400
bp for Dixon and 200 – 300 bp for others, the rest of the
parameters are the default values of this program. PrimerSNP generated 288 specific primers for strain 9a5c, 46 for
strain Temecula-1, 136 for strain Ann-1 and 6 for Dixon.
Since the number of specific primers for strain Dixon was
too low, we tried to increase the number of specific primers by manipulating the input files in various ways. First,
Dixon genome sequence was cut at 300 bp interval and
PrimerSNP designed specific primers for each individual
piece. Next, a similar process was repeated for the same
genome sequence that was cut at 500 bp, 800 bp, 1,000
bp and 2,000 bp intervals. Finally, all the specific primers
were combined together and the total number was 21.
Since the number of specific primers for strain 9a5c was
too many, we ranked the 288 primers in the descending
order of weight scores. A total of 41 specific primers were
selected at an even interval (see Additional file 1). We
tested the specific primers with three (9a5c, Temecula-1
and Dixon) of the four strains of X. fastidiosa due to the
availability of genomic DNA.

PCR reactions were done followed by running agarose
gels stained with ethidium bromide (EB) after electro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/185

phoresis. The results (Figure 7) showed that 80.4% of the
strain specific primers were successfully predicted (see
Additional file 2). They only amplified the target genomic
DNA, while no amplifications were detected using nontarget DNA. Further analysis of the result found that the
successful prediction rate was influenced by both the
weight score and the free energy (ΔG°). If the weight score
< 20,000, 75% of the primers were specific. At this weight
score level, ΔG° did not affect the prediction rate. However, if the weight score was above 20,000, ΔG° did influence the prediction rate. If ΔG° < = -55.0, 89.6% of the
primers were specific; If ΔG° < = -57.0, 100% of the primers were specific. To test the effect of the weight score and
ΔG° on the prediction rate, we categorized the data into
two groups. Group I consisted of the primers with weight
scores > = 20,000 and ΔG° < = -55.0, and Group II consisted of the rest. In both groups, the primer pairs with
false positive result were given a value of 0, and 1 otherwise. A t-test was done with R-2.6.2 on two independent
sample inference with unequal variances showed that the
value of Group I was significantly higher than Group II at
95% confidence level with a p-value less than 0.05 (see
Additional file 3).
System performance
The following example files were used to test the system
performance: four genomic sequences (totally 13.2 M) of
Xylella fastidiosa and a file (2.3 M) of 2,766 query
sequences. When no other jobs submitted, it took 3.23
hours to complete the design of specific primers and 3.43
hours for the common primers. The program efficiency of
Windows version was also tested on a PC with Windows
XP (2.8 GHz and 2 G RAM). It took 7.27 and 5.5 hours for
specific and common primer design, separately. Although
the PC version takes double the time of an online version,
it recommends that the user use the PC version since the
time for the completion of a job by the server is significantly delayed by the number of jobs in the server.

Discussion
An advantage of using PrimerSNP is that the generated
specific primers are not only allele-specific, but also
genome-specific. To ensure genome-specificity, PrimerSNP takes into consideration the partial matches of primers with non-target genomic sequences. The partial
sequences of a primer pair, especially sequences close to
the 3' end, are critical to primer specificity [2,12]. They
may have multiple matches with the target and reference
genomes. To eliminate this possibility, PrimerSNP checks
the first eight (default value, can be user-defined) nucleotides (starting from 3' to 5' end) to ensure that only one
perfect match exists between the partial 3' end sequence
and the target genomic sequences, and no match with the
non-target genomic sequences.

Figure 7
Validation of specific primers generated by PrimerSNP
Validation of specific primers generated by PrimerSNP. A total of 107 specific primers (amplicon ranges from 200 to
300 bp) of 9a5c, Temecula-1 and Dixon strains were tested using standard PCR. Each pair of the specific primer is displayed
according to its weight score (x-axis) and the free energy of melting (ΔG°) (y-axis). The red dots represent those primers that
are not specific, and blue dots represent specific primers.

PrimerSNP uses a binary exponent system to accurately
quantify the number and position of SNPs in each primer.
The weight score takes into consideration both the
number and the locations of SNPs. Thus, weight score is a
means to compare the specificity among the primer pairs.
No other programs have attempted to quantify the specificity of primers. Our initial thought was that higher
weight score could result in more specific primers. However, our experiment showed that both the weight score
and the free energy of melting (ΔG°) influenced the specificity of primers. A weight score of 20,000 is critical for
specificity. Below this value, 25% of primers are non-specific. If the weight score is greater than 20,000, the lower
the ΔG° value, the more specific of the primers. When
ΔG° value is less than -55.0, 89.9% primers are specific;
when ΔG° value is less than -57.0, all primers are specific.
Based on this result, we suggest the following selection criteria for the user: weight score > = 20,000 and ΔG° < = 55.0.

Since the purpose of PrimerSNP is to select reliable specific primers for detection purpose, it uses strict algorithm
to filter out those primers that have partial matches with
the non-target genomic sequences. Therefore, no specific
primers are generated for most query sequences. Only 1%
to 10% of query sequences have specific primers designed.
The strictness of this program ensures a higher prediction
rate (>80%).
PrimerSNP is ideal for bacterial species. It may not be suitable for virus species whose genomic sequences have high
mutation rate and therefore many strains. The detection
of a particular strain is usually out of the research interest.
PrimerSNP finds its potential usage in screening for risky
species and disease epidemics study. The Gram-negative,
xylem-colonizing bacterium Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) is the
causative agent of several important diseases including
Pierce's disease (PD) of grape vines, almond leaf scorch
disease (ALSD) and citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC)

[13]. Citrus variegated chlorois (CVC), caused by the 9a5c
strain, is not known to occur in America. Should Xf-CVC
be introduced into California, preventing its spread and
establishment in citrus growing areas would be very difficult and perhaps impossible. The availability of multiple
specific primers could be used to reliably identify this
pathogen from thousands of environmental samples.
Similarly, specific primer design could be used in identifying pathogens of citrus canker disease, caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (Xac), whose genomic
sequences are available and no occurrence has been
reported in California.

Strain differentiation is another area that PrimerSNP
could be used. Since each primer contains unique SNPs
for the strain, the change in these SNPs could be easily
detected by PCR. Instead of sequencing many target
regions, standard PCRs on these strains using specific
primers that are designed by PrimerSNP can provide a
rapid clue to this question for biologists. Multiple specific
primers can also be used for strain genotyping research.

Currently, the specific primer design using PrimerSNP for
higher organisms such as fungi is greatly limited due to
the availability of genomic sequences. With the rapid
development of sequencing technology such as 454, the
cost and time would be significantly reduced. PrimerSNP
will certainly be a useful tool for higher organisms.

Conclusion
PrimerSNP is a convenient tool that automates the process of selecting specific primers that contain strain-specific
SNPs at the genome level which can be used to reliably
differentiate one strain from other phylogeneticallyrelated strain/species.
