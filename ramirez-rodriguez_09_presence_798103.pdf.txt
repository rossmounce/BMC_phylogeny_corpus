Abstract
As part of a routine screening for the possible presence of the necrotic strains of potato virus Y
affecting potatoes in Mexico, five PVY isolates were submitted to biological and molecular analysis.
Considering their serological properties, two belong to the common strain (O) and three to the
necrotic strain (N). All the isolates induced vein necrosis in Nicotiana tabacum. To characterize the
isolates, 5' NTR and P1 genes were sequenced and compared with sequences from GenBank
database. Nucleotide sequence similarity ranged from 47–100% in the 5' NTR and from 63–100%
in the P1 coding region. The lowest amino acid similarity between sequences of P1 gene was 55%.
In phylogenetic trees of 5'NTR analysis, two PVYO Mexican isolates clustered with other PVYO
isolates. In turn, the three PVYN isolates grouped with PVYN-NTN isolates. The phylogenetic analysis
of P1 sequences (nucleotide and amino acid) showed two PVYO isolates grouping next to N-NTN
cluster. A detailed analysis of the PVYO isolates showed two potential recombination regions in the
P1 gene, in contrast to 5'NTR where no recombination was detected.

Background
Potato virus Y (PVY), the type member of the family Potyviridae, can infect potato, tobacco, tomato and pepper as
well as wild species, especially those in the Solanaceae
family [1]. The conventional classification of PVY isolates
is based on primary hosts, symptoms induced in differential plants and serological reaction to monoclonal antibodies. The isolates reported so far, have been classified in
three main strains: PVYN, PVYO and PVYC [2]. Isolates
belonging to the PVYN strain induce severe vein necrosis
on Nicotiana tabacum leaves. This strain has been divided
into two groups: the first one causing mild mosaic in most
potato cultivars, while the second one provokes "potato
tuber necrotic ring disease" (PTNRD) and severe chlorotic

mosaic in the leaves [3]. It also produces veinal necrosis in
tobaco leaves and is referred as PVYNTN [NTN = isolates
belonging to the necrotic group (N) of PVY and inducing
tuber necrosis (TN)], according to a decision of the European Association of Potato Research Virology Section
[4,5]. The PVYO strain isolates induce non-necrotic mosaics on tobacco leaves but more severe symptoms on
potato, such as crinkling, leaf dropping or severe necrotic
mosaic. The PVYC strain causes stipple streak on potato
cultivars carrying the Nc resistance gene and non-necrotic
symptoms, similar to those of PVYO, on N. tabacum leaves
[6]. The symptoms of mosaic are masked in temperatures
out of the normal rank from 10°C to 25°C.

The serological classification of PVY isolates is a matter of
discussion. Coat protein-directed polyclonal antibodies
do not discriminate between PVY strains so monoclonal
antibodies specific to O and N strains have been used to
characterize selected PVY isolates [7,8]. Moreover, some
isolates were determined as PVYO using monoclonal antibodies, nevertheless induced tobacco vein necrosis, which
are but infectious and induce less severe symptoms in
potato than the other PVYN isolates and it has been called
PVYN-Wilga isolate [9,10]. Which shows that the serological and pathogenic traits of a determined PVY isolate
seem not to have an absolute relationship and, on other
hand, some serological detections have not showed the
specificity expected [2,5,8,11].
Conventional methods of PVY classification do not result
in a universal criterion for grouping virus isolates within
species. Complete genomic nucleotide sequence analysis
of isolates which showed that the degree of similarity differs across the genome, being the 5' terminal untranslatable segment the most variable region of the PVY genome
[12]. This has led to a re-evaluation of the subgroup based
on gene sequences analysis, which has led to an alignment
with the phenotype-based classification with exceptions
concerning the ability to induce tobacco veinal necrosis.
The sequence-based clustering of all isolates reported so
far. A comparative analysis of available sequences of
necrotic and non necrotic isolates led to the hypothesis
that the tobacco vein necrosis determinant is localized in
the 3' terminal region covering the CP gene and 3' NTR
[13]. Other studies using the CP and P1 genes and the 5'
and 3' NTRs have concluded that those regions are not
involved in the induction of vein necrosis in tobacco [14].
From de clustering and necrotizing properties, it has been
suggested that the ability to cause vein necrosis in tobacco
could be located in the 5' rather than in the 3' half of the
viral RNA, in the HC-Pro protein specifically [15].
It has been suggested that the strain NTN of PVY resulted
of the natural combination between PVYO, or PVYC, and
PVYN [16]. Isolates of PVY, which might be intermediate
forms of the PVYO and PVYN groups, have been reported,
sharing similar symptoms as well as serological and
genomic properties with both groups [17]. Moreover, it
has been indicated upon comparisons of the 5'NTR and
P1 sequences of PVYN and PVYNTN from American and
European origin, that they formed separate geographic
groups whit a 98% or higher similarities between them
[18]. This suggests that the NTN strain detected in some
geographic region may have arisen from an N strain of the
same region. This may explain the difference among NTN
isolates of different geographic regions in the world. A
similar finding is reported from amino acid sequence
analyses of the capsid protein gene of American and Japanese isolates [11].

To strengthen the PVY group classification and to determine the relationships between Mexican isolates and PVY
isolates from other parts of the world, we determined the
nucleotide sequence of the 5'NTR and P1 coding region
for ten Mexican isolates and their biological characterization with six plants species. This is the first report of PVYW
and PVYN presence in Mexico.

Results
ELISA and biological tests
Two Mexican isolates showed positive reaction with PVYO
antibodies, Pic3 and Vic20 isolates (Table 1). The isolates
were inoculated to six plants species (Capsicum annuum
var. Serrano; Chenopodium quinoa; Solanum lycopersicum;
Nicotiana tabacum cv. Burley; Physalis floridana and S.
tuberosum cv. Alpha) (data no shown). In three species (N.
tabacum, Ph. floridana and S. tuberosum) symptoms were
more severe than in the other species tested. Three isolates
belonging to the N strain, Pic1, Vic6 and Vic15 (Table 1),
inoculated in plants of N. tabacum induced typical
necrotic symptoms; i.e. vein necrosis 7–10 days after inoculation. The Pic3 and Vic20 isolates, both PVYO (Table 1),
induced severe chlorotic mosaics on tobacco leaves as initial symptoms (7–10 days after inoculation) and moderate vein necrosis plus severe distortion of leaves three
weeks post-inoculation. The aggressiveness of PVY Pic3,
Vic6, Vic15 and Vic20 isolates on N. tabacum as well as the
severity of symptoms showed by Ph. floridana plants
infected with PVY Pic3, Vic6, Vic15 and Vic20 isolates was
remarkable.
Sequence analysis
5'-NTR
Twentynine nucleotide sequences of PVY 5'NTR were analyzed: (five O, sixteen N and eight NTN strains respectively). Of these sequences five were from Mexico (this
report, GenBank accession numbers AY700016–
AY700020) and twentyfour from other parts of the world.
The Mexican isolates of PVYO, namely Pic3 and Vic20
grouped in a cluster with those others identified as O and
N strains (O-N cluster) while the PVYN isolates (Vic6,
Vic15 and Pic1) grouped in a different cluster with other

N strains, besides all N-NTN strains in N-NTN cluster
(data no shown). The group "N-NTN" shows particular
clusters of the three Mexican PVYN isolates, along with
North American and European PVYN-NTN isolates. On the
other hand, the cluster "O-N" shows a specific grouping of
two PVYO isolates: PVYO-Pic3 with PVYN-Wi-P isolate
(from Poland) and PVYO-Vic-20 with PVYO-PO7 isolate
(from Canada). The twenty nine 5'NTR nucleotide analyzed ranged in similarity from 58 to 100%, and there
were no recombination sites detected after testing with the
RDP program (data not shown).
P1 gene
Thirty four sequences of the whole P1 gene (five from
Mexico) were analyzed, where they are included to O
strain (eight isolates), N strain (eighteen isolates) and
NTN strain (eight isolates), yielding a percentage of similarity ranking between 63–100%. The general clustering
shows two main groups: "O-N" and "N-NTN" (data not
shown). In the group "N-NTN" there is a subcluster composed by three isolates: two Mexican PVYO isolates (Pic3
and Vic20) with the PVYN-Wi-P Poland isolate (Accession
Number AF248500), having the highest similarity among
all the isolates analyzed: 96.5% (Vic20 and Wi-P) and
98.9% (Pic3 and Wi-P). In turn, the three Mexican isolates
of the N strain showed a clustering with seven European
isolates in the group "N-NTN" but separated from the
cluster of nine North American isolates. The P1 gene
amino acid sequences from the same isolates were analyzed; having a range in similarity of 55–100% and similar clustering to analysis of nucleotide sequences (data not
shown).

The thirtyfour nucleotide sequences of the P1 gene were
analyzed with the recombination program RDP. In this
analysis, different windows sizes and different maximum
acceptable probability values were used. In general, two
potentially recombinant regions were detected in PVYN-N
5yt and two PVYO Mexican isolates, detecting potential
crossover sites in the nucleotides in position 297, 301,
321 and 825 (Figure 1).
Based on the results obtained from the recombination
analysis of P1 gene, the thirtyfour nucleotides sequences
were analyzed in two regions. For this analysis the CLUSTALX, DNAStar, Mega3 and PAUP programs were used.
One region that included the 519 nucleotides of the 3' end
(with a similarity range of 62–100%), grouping the five
Mexican isolates next to PVYN-NTN isolates (data not
shown). The other putative region for recombination
included the 306 nucleotides near the 5' end (with a range
of 64–100%), produced a dendrogram that showed two
clusters: "O-N", where are included the Pic3, Vic20 and
PVYN-Wi-P (Accession Number AF248500) isolates, and
the "N-NTN" group which included Pic1, Vic6 and Vic15

Mexican isolates (Figure 2). The similarity between PVYO
isolates (Pic3 and Vic20) and PVYNWi-P was 98.7–99.3%,
the two Mexican PVYO isolates have 66–67% similarity
with three PVY necrotic isolates: Pic1, Vic6 and Vic15.

Discussion
Nucleotide sequence analysis of two hundred sequences
of different regions of PVY genome (data not shown) and
thirteen isolates with complete genomic sequence
reported, showed that the degree of similarity differs
across the genome, and that the 5' terminal segment is the
most variable region of the PVY genome as previously
reported [12]. In the nucleotide sequence analyses we
found more variability in the 5'NTR than in the P1 gene
(58 to 100% and 63 to 100%, respectively).
According to the antigenic and pathogenic properties
showed by five PVY Mexican isolates (Pic1, Pic3, Vic6,
Vic15 and Vic20) the serotype and the pathotype of three
necrotic isolates, Pic1, Vic6 and Vic15, they agreed. Different results were obtained with Pic3 and Vic20 isolates
wich might belong to pathotype "N" and serotype "O"
(Table 1). Isolates with similar traits to Pic3 and Vic20 isolates have been reported in Poland, Canada, Spain and
France [3,15,17,19,20]. For instance, the PVYNW (Wilga)
isolate discovered in Poland in 1984, was first described
as differing in virulence and aggressiveness in potato from
the earlier PVYN isolates and was later shown to be serologically related to PVYO isolates [14]. Additionally, the
nucleotide sequence comparisons from CP gene of Pic3
and Vic20 isolates (pathotype "N" and serotype "O" both
isolates) with seventy isolates from outside Mexico,
showed a 99% similarity with PVYO isolates and clustered
with other fifteen PVYO isolates analyzed (data not
shown).

the N strain cluster with seven European isolates in "NNTN" group but in different subgroup of nine North
American isolates. Interesting is the cluster "O-N" grouping three isolates: two from Mexico and one from Poland,
which have the highest similarity values among the thirtyfour sequences analyzed: 96.5% (between Vic20 and WiP) and 98.9% (between Pic3 and Wi-P). This subgroup of
new isolates is located in an independent branch different
from the "N-NTN" and "O-N"groups (data not shown).
There is growing evidence that RNA recombination is a
major evolutionary factor in plant RNA viruses. In our
study, from the four crossover areas detected between
PVYO-like and PVYN-like sequences, one putative recombination site was found in the P1 gene of several PVYNW
isolates. Moreover, in the P1 N-terminal region (at position 499–500) of the PVYNWi-P isolate there seems to be
a switching from PVYO- to PVYN-like sequence [15,16].

Despite the high variability of the 5'NTR, the clustering of
the twenty-nine isolates here analyzed can be arranged in
two groups, "O-N" and "N-NTN" (data not shown). The
PVYO-Pic3 Mexican isolate grouped with PVYN-Wi-P
(from Poland) and the PVYO-Vic20 grouped with PVYOPO7 (from Canada). The sequences of Mexico and Poland
isolates showed a sequence similarity of 99%, while the
sequences from other subcluster (Mexico-Canada)
showed a similarity of 96%. This specific and apparently
discordant clustering of two PVYO Mexican isolates with
isolates from different geographic regions is similar to the
one observed in other works [15,21]. Two Canadian isolates (I-136 and I-L56) were found to be closely related to
the PVYN N242 (European) isolate in the 5'NTR region
with 99% nucleotide similarity [15].
The dendrogram obtained using thirtyfour P1 gene whole
sequences (data not shown) shows two main groups, the
O-N and the N-NTN groups. The three Mexican isolates of

In this work with thirty four P1 gene sequences were analyzed and potential crossover recombination sites were
detected in the nucleotides 297, 301, 321 and 825 (Figure
1), resulting from a possible recombination event
between the N 5yt isolate (from North America and
potential parent) with the Pic3 and Vic20 isolates. This
result led us to analyze the same thirty four P1 gene
sequences (each one of 825 nucleotides) in two regions:
the first, from 3' terminal region of 519 nucleotides and,
the second, from 5' terminal region of 306 nucleotides.
Two different clusters for both PVYO Mexican isolates
(Pic3 and Vic20) were noticed. Firstly, the analysis of thirtyfour sequences of the 3' terminal region of the P1 gene
(519 nucleotides) clustered both PVYO Mexican isolates
within group of PVYN-NTN isolates (data not shown). On
the other hand, the analysis of the 5' terminal region (306
nucleotides) produced a clustering of PVYO Mexican isolates within the group of PVYO-N isolates (Figure 2).

Conclusion
This is the first report of PVY necrotic strains in Mexico
with two PVY isolates belonging to O strain (by serologic
detection) that could be described as PVYN-like isolates
(Wilga strains). Based in our analysis and observations,
we suggest that the virus determinants of tobacco necrosis
may be localized at the 3' end of the PVY P1 gene.

Methods
Viral isolates and bioassays
Five isolates of PVY were collected from potato plants in
the State of Mexico. The infected plants in all cases
showed distinct mottling and leaf distortion. The plants
were maintained the greenhouses of the Dirección General de Sanidad Vegetal (SAGARPA, Mexico) during the
course of this study.

The PVY isolates were inoculated in six host species maintained at greenhouse conditions on natural daylight periods (about 12 hours) and temperatures ranging between
15° to 26°C. Chenopodium quinoa, Capsicum annuum (var.
Serrano),Solanum lycopersicum, Nicotiana tabacum (cv. Burley), Physalis floridana and Solanum tuberosum (cv. Alpha)
were the host species used, and ten plants from each specie were inoculated with each one of the Mexican isolates.
ELISA testing
Serological tests were performed by double-antibody
sandwich enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (DASELISA) for detection of PVA, PLRV, PVS, PVX and PVY,
using commercial buffers and antibodies from AGDIA
(catalogue number in parenthesis). The tests were carried
out with: PAbs for PVA (SRA-60000), PLRV (SRA-30002),
PVS (SRA-40000), PVX (SRA-10000), PVY (SRA-20001)
and Mabs for PVYO+C (SRA-20600), PVYC (SRA-20700),
PVYN (SRA-26000). A positive result was taken as an
absorbance (at 405 nm) of three times the mean of the

corresponding negative control after incubation for 1 h at
room temperature
RT-PCR and sequencing
RNA was extracted from the same plants used for ELISA
test using the TRIZOL® method (Gibco BRL). DNA amplification of the 5'NTR and P1 regions was done in two
steps: the first one to perform the reverse transcription
(RT) reaction and later the PCR. RT step was done using
the enzyme M-MLV RT (Promega Corporation. Madison,
WI, USA), using the reverse primer 3P1R (5'-AGGATATCTCATTCGTGCCC-3') in order to reverse transcribe
the 5'NTR-P1 genomic region. The same primer used in
RT and the forward primer G-121 (5'-AATTAAAACAACTCAATACAACATAAGAAA-3') were used in the PCRs. The
amplified products were cloned in the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). Nucleotide sequencing of cloned PCR products was carried out
on plasmid minipreps (High Pure Plasmid Isolation Kit,
Hoffman-La Roche, LTD, Basel, Switzerland)) using an

Norwalk, CT).
Sequence analysis
In order to carry out a detailed comparison of the 5'NTR
region and the P1 gene of PVY, sequence alignments were
made of 29 and 34 different isolates, for 5'NTR region and
P1 gene respectively. The 5'NTR region analysis included
3 PVYO and 21 PVYN/NTN isolates obtained from the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (Table 2),
along with sequences from the two PVYO and three PVYN
isolates described in this paper (Table 1). The P1 gene
analysis included 6 PVYO and 23 PVYN/NTN isolates
obtained from sequence databases (NCBI) (Table 2),
along with the two PVYO and three PVYN sequences isolated in Mexico (Table 1). The sequence analysis was
made using the whole sequence of 5'NTR or P1 gene.

Multiple alignment of the 5'NTR and P1 genes of nucleotide sequences (and amino acid sequences for P1 gene)
were obtained using the CLUSTALX, DNAStar and PAUP
package. Phylogenetic relationships were determined in
the MEGA3 package. Distance matrices were calculated
with the Kimura two-parameter option, and distance trees
were constructed from these matrices by the Neighbor
Joining method. Other methods tested like UPMGA, Minimum Evolution and Maximum Parsimony gave similar
results, with little significant difference. A value for each
internal node was estimated for statistical significance of
branching by performing 10,000 replications of the bootstrap resampling from the original data. For recombination analysis in the 5'NTR and the P1 gene the
Recombination Detection Program (RDP) was used. Pairwise identity plots were used to identify possible recombinant regions.
