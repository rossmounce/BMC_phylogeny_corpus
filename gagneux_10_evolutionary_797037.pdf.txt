Evolutionary forces in Mycobacterium tuberculosis:
implications for product development

Research on the evolutionary forces that have shaped
the genetic diversity in Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(M.tb), in particular natural selection, random genetic
drift, migration, and changes in demography have
important implications for product development. Until
now, scientists have not been able to quantify the
genetic differences among M.tb groups. By tracking
genomic deletions, six major lineages of M.tb have been
identified in humans, with distinct geographical distributions. The Asian M.tb lineages cause the highest global
TB burden, but most research has been done on EuroAmerican strains. Our team has performed a multilocus sequencing analysis of 89 genes in 99 strains of
human M.tb, eight strains of animal-adapted strains and
the distantly-related M. canettii. We have worked to
identify the sources of diversity in human-adapted M.tb
and the evolutionary forces that shape this diversity.
Using the DNA sequences of the 89 selected genes as a
basis for a comparison, then we constructed a phylogentic tree which supported the M.tb groupings defined
earlier by genomic deletion analyses. However, using
DNA sequence data, actual genetic distances could be
computed that suggested there was as much difference
between some human strains as between M. bovis and
some human M.tb strains. Our research has also determined that the six human-adapted M.tb lineages are
part of two main clades, an evolutionary “ancient” clade
found in the Philippines, around the Indian Ocean, and
in West Africa, and an evolutionary “modern” clade
with a much wider geographic distribution.
Additionally, the role of selection in M.tb evolution
was analyzed through the ratio per site of non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions (dN), which change the
amino acid sequence, to synonymous nucleotide

substitutions (dS) that do not result in a change in the
amino acid sequence (dN/dS). The dN/dS in M.tb was
0.57, much higher than most other bacteria. We
explored three possible reasons for this high dN/dS: 1)
M.tb is a recently-evolved pathogen and insufficient
time has occurred for natural selection to remove nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (nSNP)
mutations which are likely to be deleterious, 2) the host
immune system is selecting for variability in M.tb to
evade the host immune responses, or 3) natural selection against nSNPs is reduced. Our team concluded that
the latter explanation was the most likely as we found
that 58% of non-synonymous changes in M.tb occurred
in regions of proteins that were highly conserved in
other mycobacterial species. This suggests that purifying
selection against nSNPs is reduced in M.tb compared to
other bacteria, and as a consequence many of these
nSNPs are likely to impact protein function.
