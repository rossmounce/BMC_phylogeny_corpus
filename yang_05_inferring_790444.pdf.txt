Abstract
Background: Since transcription factors are often regulated at the post-transcriptional level, their
activities, rather than expression levels may provide valuable information for investigating functions
and their interactions. The recently developed Network Component Analysis (NCA) and its
generalized form (gNCA) provide a robust framework for deducing the transcription factor
activities (TFAs) from various types of DNA microarray data and transcription factor-gene
connectivity. The goal of this work is to demonstrate the utility of TFAs in inferring transcription
factor functions and interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle regulation.
Results: Using gNCA, we determined 74 TFAs from both wild type and fkh1 fkh2 deletion mutant
microarray data encompassing 1529 ORFs. We hypothesized that transcription factors
participating in the cell cycle regulation exhibit cyclic activity profiles. This hypothesis was
supported by the TFA profiles of known cell cycle factors and was used as a basis to uncover other
potential cell cycle factors. By combining the results from both cluster analysis and periodicity
analysis, we recovered nearly 90% of the known cell cycle regulators, and identified 5 putative cell
cycle-related transcription factors (Dal81, Hap2, Hir2, Mss11, and Rlm1). In addition, by analyzing
expression data from transcription factor knockout strains, we determined 3 verified (Ace2, Ndd1,
and Swi5) and 4 putative interaction partners (Cha4, Hap2, Fhl1, and Rts2) of the forkhead
transcription factors. Sensitivity of TFAs to connectivity errors was determined to provide
confidence level of these predictions.
Conclusion: By subjecting TFA profiles to analyses based upon physiological signatures we were
able to identify cell cycle related transcription factors consistent with current literature,
transcription factors with potential cell cycle dependent roles, and interactions between
transcription factors.

Background
Transcription factor activities (TFAs) rather than levels of
transcription factor expression mediate transcriptional

regulations. Various post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications abolish significant correlations
between TFAs and the level of transcription factor

expression. Therefore, a strategy to determine the physiological functions and interactions of transcription factors
based on the analysis of TFA profiles would be more fundamentally sound than one based on transcript levels per
se. However, owing to post-translational modifications,
TFAs are difficult to measure experimentally and therefore, many analyses infer TFAs by computational analysis
of target gene expression levels either from single regulatory factors alone or in combination [1-10]. Among these,
Network Component Analysis (NCA) [3] and generalized
NCA (gNCA) [2] provide a robust framework for deducing TFAs based on DNA microarray data, promoter connectivity, and genetic regulatory constraints imposed by
regulatory knock-out experiments. Using TFA profiles
deduced by NCA and gNCA, we are now in a position to
assign transcription factor functions and reconstruct functional interactions between transcription factors.
The goal of this work is to demonstrate how we analyze
TFA profiles to determine physiologically relevant characteristics of transcription factors. Specifically, by analyzing
TFA profiles of the S. cerevisiae cell cycle we identify cell
cycle regulators and putative interaction partners of two
forkhead transcription factors (Fkh1 and Fkh2) that are
responsible for expression of a gene cluster within the M/
G1 interval and involved in mitotic exit [11].
Once TFA profiles are determined, the transcription factor
regulators and interactions are deduced based on the following hypotheses: 1) Transcription factors with similar
activity patterns function together; 2) Transcription factors involved in cell cycle regulation exhibit oscillatory
activity patterns, 3) Activities of transcription factors
which functionally interact with each other will be disturbed if one of the interacting partners is deleted. These
hypotheses are in spirit similar to the traditional analysis
of gene expression. In contrast to traditional analysis of
gene expression, our analyses are constructed and applied
directly to TFA profiles.

Results
Overall strategy
A flow diagram demonstrating the relationships between
each component of the methodology is presented in Figure 1. Given the gene expression data and connectivity
network between transcription factors and gene expression, we first deduced TFAs from gene expression by using
gNCA. The deduced TFAs were then analyzed by two complementary methods. First, we used cluster analysis [12]
to group TFAs that behave in a similar manner. Second, a
statistical analysis [4] was used to determine if the signal
from each of the TFAs was periodic. The results from these
two analyses were integrated to deduce putative cell cycle
regulators. We hypothesized that putative cell cycle regulators should exhibit periodic activity profiles and cluster

closely with known cell cycle regulators. Then TFA profiles
from wild type and the fkh1 fkh2 mutant strain under the
same experimental conditions were statistically analyzed
to deduce transcription factors whose profiles were significantly perturbed, thus identifying putative functional
interaction partners of the fork-head transcription factors.
Application of gNCA to the combined wild-type and
mutant data set
We used gNCA to analyze both the wild-type [13] and the
fkh1 fkh2 mutant data [11]. The wild-type data and the TFknockout data were organized in different columns of the
E matrix (expression data matrix where Eij corresponds to
the log of gene expression ratio of gene i evaluated at
experiment j, see Methods). The elements in P (TFA matrix
where Pij corresponds to the log of relative transcription
factor activity of TF i at experiment j, see Methods) corresponding to the specific knockout strain were kept at zero,
in addition to the zero constraints placed in A (control
strength matrix where Aij denotes the control strength of
transcription factor j on gene i, see Methods) according to
the transcription factor-gene connectivity information.

The first step in gNCA was to select sub-networks based on
available transcription factor-gene connectivity [14]. Each
sub-network was constructed to satisfy the gNCA criteria.
gNCA requires that the number of transcription factors (L)
in each sub-network be less than that of data points (M)
in the data matrix. In the combined cell cycle microarray
data set, M = 69, and thus the number of transcription factor in gNCA in each analysis cannot exceed 69. Thus, subsets of the 104 transcription factors included in the
genome-wide location analysis [14] were selected to form
sub-networks for gNCA. Overlapping random sub-networks were generated and screened using the gNCA criteria. Among them, four that satisfy the gNCA criteria were
selected in order to show that using multiple sub-networks makes it possible to determine TFAs more than the
number of data points (M = 69). Each sub-network contained 40 transcription factors, but together, a total of 74
transcription factors were analyzed. The transcription factors involved in each of the 4 sub-networks are shown in
Figure 2. Only 16 transcription factors among 74 transcription factors were fully overlapped among all 4 subnetworks.
After applying gNCA independently to the 4 sub-networks, 74 TFAs were determined. Figure 3 shows the TFAs
of the 11 known cell cycle factors from 4 different sub-networks. Qualitatively, these TFAs appear to show expected
oscillatory behavior for 1, 2, and 3 cycles according to the
method of synchronization (elutriation, α-factor arrest,
and cdc15 mutation). The dynamics of overlapping TFA
profiles between the four different sub-networks are very
similar. This indicates that the deduced TFAs were insen-

sitive to the sub-network selection. In addition, combining the fkh1 fkh2 mutant data with the wild-type data
yields similar TFAs predicted from wild-type data alone
[3], suggesting the consistency between the two data sets.
It is recognized that most transcription factors are regulated in post-transcriptional processes. Thus, their activity
may deviate significantly from the expression level as

noted previously [3]. For 27 transcription factors with
both gene expression level and TFA available, the correlation coefficients ranged from - 0.5 to 0.6. The wide range
difference in the correlation coefficients confirms that
TFAs and expression levels exhibit very different dynamic
profiles and therefore TFAs cannot be substituted by
expression levels in analysis.

Comparison of TFA profiles of 11 major yeast cell cycle related transcription factors between wild type and
fkh1 fkh2 mutant. The first 3 columns corresponds to data deduced from yeast cultures synchronized by elutriation, α-factor
arrest, and arrest of a cdc15 temperature-sensitive mutant which can give one cell cycle, two cell cycles, and three cell cycles
for given experimental measurements, respectively. The last column corresponds to fkh1 fkh2 double knock-out mutant synchronized with α-factor arrest. Different stages in the cell cycle are indicated by the color code. Different colors in TFA profiles for each transcription factor represent TFAs from different sub-networks. S1, S2, S3 and S4 represent sub-networks 1, 2,
3, and 4, respectively.

Table 1: Sensitivity of TFA profiles to errors in connectivity from ChIP-chip assay. Connectivity errors were simulated by randomly
inserting and deleting connections in the connectivity graph generated from the ChIP-chip assay. gNCA was performed on the
perturbed connectivity, and the resultant TFAs were compared to those from un-perturbed connectivity via the correlation
coefficient. This procedure was performed on each of the 4 subnetworks 100 times. The average correlation coefficients for
transcription factors in the 4 subnetworks are presented here. A low correlation coefficient (<0.5) suggests sensitivity to network
connectivity error.

Sensitivity Analysis
To assess the effect of connectivity errors on our results,
we altered up to 10% of the connectivity graph for every
subnetwork, by randomly deleting and inserting connections between transcription factors and genes. This effectively simulates the presence of false negatives and false

positives in ChIP-chip assays. Subsequently, we ran gNCA
on our randomly perturbed graphs and compared the
deduced TFAs to our reported results via the correlation
coefficient. The procedure was performed 100 times and
the TFAs deduced from each run were compared with the
TFAs computed with unaltered connectivity using Pearson

correlation coefficients (Table 1). Transcription factors
with high correlation coefficients suggest robustness of
the results against connectivity errors.

gested that transcription factors related to many other cellular processes may be involved in or dependent on cell
cycle regulation to coordinate cellular processes [14].

Determination of cell cycle-dependent regulators based on
TFA dynamics
We hypothesized that transcription factors with similar
activity patterns are involved in related processes. Thus,
clustering of TFAs would allow identification of transcription factors related to cell cycle regulation. After hierarchical clustering (Figure 4), 11 transcriptional factors (Dal81,
Dig1, Gat3, Hap2, Hir2, Mss11, Pdr1, Rlm1, Rph1, Yap5,
and Yap6) were found to cluster closely with the 11
known cell cycle regulators.

Functional interaction of FKH1 FKH2 with other
transcription factors
Comparing the TFAs derived from the wild-type strain and
the fkh1 fkh2 mutant under the same experimental conditions allows the determination of functional interactions
between Fkh1 Fkh2 with other transcription factors. If
such interaction exists, the activities of the interaction
partners will change in the fkh1 fkh2 mutant. In general
the fkh1 fkh2 mutant showed reduced oscillation amplitude as compared to the wild type (Figure 3). In particular,
Ace2, Swi5, and Ndd1 showed significantly reduced oscillation in the fkh1 fkh2 mutant, suggesting potential interactions between these transcription factors and the two
fork-head transcription factors. Indeed, it was found that
Fkh2 forms a complex with Mcm1 and Ndd1 [16,17]
which controls G2/M genes and also binds the promoters
of Ace2 and Swi5 to activate genes at the following M/G1
phase. The reduced amplitude in TFAs of Ace2 and Swi5
in the fkh1 fkh2 mutant support that there is a cascade
interaction between the two forkhead transcription factors and Ace2 and Swi5 [16].

In addition to cluster analysis, we performed a statistical
test to identify the set of TFAs with a periodic profile. Figure 5A shows the power spectra of the 11 known cell cycle
regulator. A power spectrum is a representation of a signal
in the frequency domain. A dominant peak in the power
spectrum corresponds to the fact that the underlying process has a principal oscillation frequency. Most of the
power spectra to identify periodic patterns exhibit a single
strong peak at low frequency. This suggests that the
dynamic profiles appear to be periodic. To classify
whether a signal is periodic or not, we employed a statistical criterion [4] of rejecting the null hypothesis of purely
random process. The result suggests that 9 out of 11
known cell cycle regulators exhibit periodic behavior. This
confirms that the activity profiles of cell cycle regulators
are periodic. We then applied the same periodicity test to
the rest of 63 transcription factors and found that about
16 of the deduced TFAs from elutriation and α-factor
arrest were statistically periodic and 44 of the deduced
TFAs from cdc15 were statistically periodic. Combining
the results of the periodicity test and cluster analysis, we
found that 5 (Dal81, Hap2, Hir2, Mss11, and Rlm1) out
of the 11 transcription factors closely clustered with the
known cell cycle factors were statistically periodic and
were regarded as putative cell cycle-related regulators.
The power spectra of these 5 putative cell cycle regulators
are shown in Figure 5B, and the TFA profiles of these regulators are illustrated in Figure 6. The clustered TFA pattern of all cell cycle-related transcription factors (Figure 8)
shows that the peak activities of these transcription factors
gradually change from one phase to another through the
cell cycle. Among the 5 putative cell cycle-related regulators, Hir2 is a regulator of histones [1,15], and it is therefore reasonable to expect it to have cell cycle related
functions. It is not clear how the other 4 transcription factors are related to cell cycle regulation. Lee et al. [14] categorized Dal81 and Mss11 as metabolism regulators, Hir2
as a DNA/RNA/Protein biosynthesis regulator, and Rlm1
as environmental response regulators. These results sug-

TFA profiles of the wild-type strain (Figure 3) show that
Ace2 and Swi5 were most active around M/G1 phase
while Fkh1, Fkh2, Mcm1, and Ndd1 were most active at
G2/M, G2, M/G1, and G2/M phase, respectively. These
results are well consistent with previous results that
Mcm1, Ace2, and Swi5 are M/G1 transcriptional regulators while the complex of Mcm1, Fkh2 and Ndd1 is a G2/
M activator. Therefore, this result shows that TFA in a
regulator knockout strain can be used to determine functional interactions.
By utilizing the Pearson correlation coefficient and deviation coefficient defined in the Methods section, Figure 8
shows that most transcription factors were aggregated in
one cluster. Outside of this cluster are transcription factors
which potentially were affected by the fkh1 fkh2 mutation
and thus are functional interaction partners of the forkhead transcription factors. These interaction partners
include Ace2, Ndd1, and Swi5, which are known to interact with Fkh2, and Hap2, Rts2, Cha4, and Fhl1, which
were not known to interact with the forkhead transcription factors. In particular, Hap2 was also identified in the
above analysis as a putative cell cycle-related regulator,
supporting their functional interaction with the forkhead
transcription factors. Cha4 and Hap2 were classified as
metabolism-related factors, Fhl1 DNA/RNA/Protein synthesis, and Rts2 cell cycle and data processing [14]. Their
modes of interaction with the forkhead transcription factors remain unknown.

Discussion
Transcriptional regulators are commonly modified at the
post-transcriptional level, and consequently their
biological activities do not correlate significantly with
expression levels. Previous work infer TFAs from expression levels of genes regulated by single factors or in combination [2,5-8,10]. In general, the major difference
between previous work and that of NCA is that the former
require an explicit quantification of the control strengths
(the A matrix in NCA) a priori. Bussemaker et al. [7]
defined the control strength as the motif copy number in
corresponding promoters and found that there was no statistical benefit to model expression with more than single
factors and thus deduced single TFAs. Wang et al. [6] considered an expression-weighted motif to find potential
target genes of single transcription factors. Gao et al. [18]
used ChIP-chip log occupancy ratios as a surrogate for
transcription factor binding affinity. In contrast, NCA
explicitly models combinatorial regulation of gene expres-

sion, and allows both the control strengths and the TFAs
to be deduced simultaneously with given network connectivity. In this approach, the lack of connectivity in specific
pairs of transcription factor and promoter is used to provide constraints for data decomposition in order to obtain
unique solutions when specific criteria are satisfied [3].
gNCA expands these capabilities by allowing incorporation of constraints onto the deduced TFAs, such as transcription factor knockout experiments, which offer a rich
source of data and biochemical information. Development of these methodologies significantly expands the
capabilities of transcriptional regulation analysis. With
gNCA, we analyzed the combined wild-type and fkh1 fkh2
mutant data set and showed that gNCA can be used to
identify TFAs which are consistent with cell physiology,
transcription factors with potential cell cycle dependent
roles, as well as interactions between transcription factors.

Hierarchical clustering of TFA profiles of the 11 known cell cycle factors (blue) and the 5 putative cell cycledependent factors (black). TFs denoted in blue are those TFs known to be involved in cell cycle.

On the basis that transcription factors exhibiting similar
activity patterns function together, we identified 11 transcription factors that clustered closely with the known cell
cycle regulators. We performed a periodicity test to determine the TFA profiles that exhibit periodic behavior, and
by combining the sets of transcription factors collected by
these two methods, we identified 5 putative cell cyclerelated regulators: Dal81, Hap2, Hir2, Mss11, and Rlm1.
These transcription factors may participate in functions
driven by cell cycles, or may regulate cell cycle directly or
indirectly.
Our comparison between the wild-type TFAs and the
mutant TFAs confirmed that the forkhead transcription
factors interact with Ace2, Ndd1, and Swi5. This result is
consistent with previous reports [16,17]. Using this
approach, we identified 4 additional transcription factors
that may functionally interact with Fkh1 Fkh2 directly or
indirectly: Hap2, Rts2, Cha4, and Fhl1. Most of these transcription factors are not known to be related to cell cycle,
suggesting that cell cycle regulation interacts with other
physiological functions.
It is worth noting that our analysis can be sensitive to
errors in the connectivity graph. Through a sensitivity
analysis we determined that all the known cell cycle regu-

lators and all the known forkhead interaction partners
have TFAs that exhibit low sensitivity to the connectivity
network when using 0.5 as a correlation coefficient
threshold. These results suggest that our analysis is robust
to errors in connectivity. With the same sensitivity criterion, 2 (Dal81 and Rlm1) of the 5 putative cell cyclerelated regulators and 1 (Fhl1) of the 4 putative forkhead
interaction partners were determined to be robust to connectivity errors. The lack of sensitivity to error increases
confidence in these predictions.
A total of 1529 (out of 6200) genes and 74 (out of 104)
transcription factors were analyzed from 69 microarray
experiments. Both limited connectivity information from
ChIP-chip and missing data points in DNA microarray
expression attribute to the limited number of genes and
TFs that can be studied in the current investigation. On the
other hand, the results suggest that our analysis on this
limited set of genes and TFs appears to be sufficient: our
analysis strategy recovers nearly 90% of the known cell
cycle regulators. On the basis of the TFA profiles, the time
series of the key cell cycle regulators are summarized in
Figure 9. A dominant feature in this map is the overlapping TFAs among known cell cycle regulators. This is common among some transcription factor complexes,
including SBF (Swi4/Swi6) and MBF (Mbp1/Swi6), as

well as transcription factors known to regulate the same
phase in the cell cycle including Ace2, Swi5 and Mcm1
(Figure 9A). In addition, overlapping TFAs were also
observed among different phases of cell cycle: transcription factors during one stage regulate transcription factors
that function in the next stage. It is well known that serial
regulation among transcription factors forms a connected
regulatory network [17]. From the TFA profiles, we also
observe the intrinsic property of the connected regulatory
network among cell cycle factors in cell cycle regulation
(Figure 9A).
Among the putative cell cycle-related transcription factors
(Figure 6), Dal81 is phosphorylated by Cdk1 [19] which
is considered to be involved in G2/M transition [20]. The
activity of Dal81 peaked over the G2/M phase is also in
agreement with its regulatory role (Figure 9B). Hir2 functions as a transcriptional repressor of histone gene expression during the cell cycle [15]. Histone synthesis is

triggered at the beginning of the S phase. So Hir2 is
expected to have the lowest TFA around S phase. As such,
TFA of Hir2 from NCA showed that it indeed has the lowest TFA around S phase (Figure 7). Most well characterized
transcription factors showed biologically relevant activity
profiles at specific cell cycle phases, suggesting that TFAs
deduced from gNCA are biologically meaningful and a
good predictor of transcription factor function and
interaction.

Conclusion
Protein function and interaction are often deduced computationally through analysis of genomic sequence, protein sequence, domain architecture, phylogenic profile, or
gene expression level. Gene expression analysis represents
the only current technique that takes into account
dynamic behavior to assign interaction and function.
However, it has been shown that for proteins significantly
regulated post-transcriptionally (e.g. transcription factors)

odicity analysis, we recovered more than 90% of transcription factors that are proposed to be involved in cell
cycle regulation. In addition, we discovered 5 putative
transcription factors that may be related to cell cycle
regulation. Functional interactions between transcription
factors were determined by isolating statistically significant perturbations in TFA patterns between mutant
∆fkh1∆fkh2 and wild-type experiments carried out under
the same experimental conditions. This method allowed
for the identification of 4 novel and 3 previously verified
fork-head transcription factor interaction partners. We
recognize that the Chip-chip data may be conditiondependent and noisy. However, together with microarray
data, they provide useful information for functional
deduction of transcription regulators.

Methods
Gene expression data and connectivity information
In this study, we utilized microarray data sets which were
taken from wild-type S. cerevisiae cultures synchronized by
three independent methods, α-factor arrest, elutriation,
and arrest of a cdc15 temperature-sensitive mutant [13]
and a mutant that lacks in two forkhead transcription factors [11], Fkh1 and Fkh2 synchronized by α-factor arrest.
The two data sets were combined after imputation [21] to
fill in missing points, and common genes without missing
data points between the two were selected for NCA. The
wild type and the mutant data were organized side-byside in different columns of the data matrix. The total
number of microarray experiments in the combined dataset was 69.

their gene expression levels do not correlate well with
their activity. Here a method for screening the physiological roles of transcription factors and their functional
interactions based on their dynamic activity profiles was
introduced. Our method first determines TFAs, which
were then further analyzed with cluster and periodicity
analysis to determine transcription factor function. By
combining the results from both cluster analysis and peri-

The connectivity information between transcription factors and their regulated genes comes from the genomewide location or ChIP-chip assay [14]. In this study, the pvalue threshold used was 0.001 for determining connectivity. As with any other method for determining genome
wide transcriptional networks, the ChIP-chip assay suffers
from miss-connectivity issues. Both under- and over-prediction errors in connectivity can be rationalized to occur
in genome wide location analysis. Since NCA deductions
are dependent on the connectivity graph generated by
ChIP-chip assays, we endeavoured to determine the
effects of connectivity errors on our TFA profiles.
gNCA
NCA and its extension, gNCA, are a recent-developed
technique that is capable of deducing TFAs based on gene
expression. Compared to NCA, a distinct feature of gNCA
is the capability of imposing constraints on both the
regulatory network and regulatory signals. This considerable expands the range of network topologies capable of
being analyzed with NCA, and thus allows application of
the method to a much larger expanse of scenarios. The
analysis starts with defining a model that expresses gene

Page 13 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:90

expressions as a function of TFA and the corresponding
control strengths (CS). The resulting model can be written
in a log-log form. In matrix notation, this model is:
E = A × P + Γ,

(1)

where Eij = log(gi(tj) / gi(t0)) and gi(tj) is the expression of
i-th gene evaluated at time tj, A is the regulatory network
of control strengths where Aij denotes the control strength
of transcription factor j on gene i (Aij = CSij), Pij = log(TFAi
(tj) / TFAi (t0)) with TFAi (tj) being the i-th transcription
factor activity evaluated at time tj, and Γ represents external stimulus and stochastic background noise from the
DNA microarray. The dimensions of E, A and P are (N ×
M), (N × L) and (L × M), respectively, where N is the
number of genes in the network, M is the number of data
points or experiments conducted, and L is the number of
transcription factors used in the study. Since most genes
are regulated by only a subset of transcription factors, A is
generally sparse. This sparse connectivity pattern in A is
defined by ZA, which can be obtained from ChIP-chip
assay or existing databases. In addition, gNCA can impose
constraints on P. For example, when a gene that codes for
a specific transcription factor is deleted, the TFA profile
(represented in the P matrix) is set to zero. The corresponding zero pattern of P is denoted as ZP. If ZA and ZP
satisfy a given set of conditions, then gNCA can
decompose the data E into A and P up to a diagonal scaling factor. This condition is called essential uniqueness
[3,22]. Additional technical details may be found
elsewhere.
Selection of multiple sub-networks for gNCA
Among the set of required conditions for an essentially
unique decomposition, a necessary condition is that the
number of transcription factors (L) must be less than the
number of data points (M) in a given network. Therefore,
to analyze a large network in yeast, we dissected the regulatory network into multiple sub-networks and recombine them at the end of the analysis. Each sub-network
was constructed such that the number of transcription factors was less than the number of time data points.

Satisfaction of the NCA identifiablity criteria [3,22] for
each sub-network requires that each sub-network contain
some overlapping TFs to ensure consistency among the
computed dynamics. This is possible because the nature
of the transcriptional regulatory network as determined
by genome-wide location analysis data reveals that some
transcript factors highly overlap the set of genes on the
microarray [14]. Including these transcript factors in each
sub-network decomposition step achieves the required
consistency. First we select randomly k transcript factors
from the column of A as an initial sub-network (S'). If this
sub-network fails a rank check we then remove the l TFs

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/90

that cause the rank deficiency, and replace them with l
new TFs that were not used to create S'. The top l TFs are
chosen by ranking the TFs by the total number of genes
they control in descending order. If this continues to fail
greater than a specified number of iterations, then we
change k (usually to a smaller number) and repeat the
process. For large enough k (40 TFs) it is likely that the
many genes overlap because of the a priori network structure. This is by no means the only way to construct subnetworks, nor is it the optimal way. We do not guarantee
that this will work in all cases, but for our purposes it is
sufficient to generate consistent TFAs.
Among the combined data set with imputed missing data
points, a total of 1818 genes with connectivity information of 104 TFs from genome wide location analysis were
used to generate random sub-networks. Sub-networks
with 40 transcription factors from total 104 TFs were generated and examined for gNCAuniqueness conditions.
Four gNCA-compliant sub-networks, with 1110, 847,
1015, and 795 genes respectively, were chosen such that
total number of TFAs deduced from 4 random sub-networks could be greater than the number of data points (M
= 69). For each sub-network containing Fkh1 or Fkh2, the
corresponding TFAs in the P matrix corresponding to the
deletion mutant were constrained to zero.
Cluster analysis of TFA profiles
The identification of potential new cell cycle factors was
conducted by using hierarchical clustering on the TFA profiles. Specifically, hierarchical clustering based on absolute value of Pearson correlation coefficient, which
measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables, was applied to TFA profiles
deduced by gNCA. We hypothesize that transcription factors with similar activities function together. Therefore,
transcription factors which are clustered together with 11
known cell cycle factors could be considered as possible
cell cycle-dependent transcription factors. Publicly
available software packages, Cluster and Treeview [12]
were used for this test.
Periodicity analysis of TFA profiles
We identify periodic functions from stochastic background noise by employing a statistical analysis technique
described previously [4]. This technique is based on rejecting the null hypothesis of a purely random process
through considering the power spectrum of a time
dependent signal. First, the technique computes the
power spectrum of a given signal and evaluates the g-statistics expressed as the contribution of the power
spectrum at a specific frequency to the total intensity of
the power spectrum. Large values of g-statistics suggest
that the underlying process is periodic. Then, the signals
are screened for periodic motion using multiple testing

under the criterion of false discovery rate (FDR). The R
package GeneTS. [4] was used for this study.
Statistical analysis for interaction determination
The effect of fkh1 and fkh2 mutations on TFAs is elucidated by examining the correlation between TFAs from
the wild type and the mutant under the same experimental condition. If there is a significant difference in TFAs
between the wild type and mutant, the correlation coefficient should be low. However, low correlation coefficients
may be caused by low overall activities, since in those situations the TFAs are dominated by noise. Therefore, we
need to define a new deviation coefficient of TFAs
between two strains to systematically identify transcription factors whose activity profiles are affected by fkh1
fkh2 mutation. This new deviation coefficient is defined
as,
