Abstract
Background: Coffee is one of the world’s most important crops; it is consumed worldwide and plays a significant
role in the economy of producing countries. Coffea arabica and C. canephora are responsible for 70 and 30% of
commercial production, respectively. C. arabica is an allotetraploid from a recent hybridization of the diploid
species, C. canephora and C. eugenioides. C. arabica has lower genetic diversity and results in a higher quality
beverage than C. canephora. Research initiatives have been launched to produce genomic and transcriptomic data
about Coffea spp. as a strategy to improve breeding efficiency.
Results: Assembling the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of C. arabica and C. canephora produced by the
Brazilian Coffee Genome Project and the Nestlé-Cornell Consortium revealed 32,007 clusters of C. arabica and
16,665 clusters of C. canephora. We detected different GC3 profiles between these species that are related to
their genome structure and mating system. BLAST analysis revealed similarities between coffee and grape (Vitis
vinifera) genes. Using KA/KS analysis, we identified coffee genes under purifying and positive selection. Protein
domain and gene ontology analyses suggested differences between Coffea spp. data, mainly in relation to
complex sugar synthases and nucleotide binding proteins. OrthoMCL was used to identify specific and prevalent
coffee protein families when compared to five other plant species. Among the interesting families annotated
are new cystatins, glycine-rich proteins and RALF-like peptides. Hierarchical clustering was used to
independently group C. arabica and C. canephora expression clusters according to expression data extracted
from EST libraries, resulting in the identification of differentially expressed genes. Based on these results, we
emphasize gene annotation and discuss plant defenses, abiotic stress and cup quality-related functional
categories.
Conclusion: We present the first comprehensive genome-wide transcript profile study of C. arabica and C.
canephora, which can be freely assessed by the scientific community at http://www.lge.ibi.unicamp.br/
coffea. Our data reveal the presence of species-specific/prevalent genes in coffee that may help to explain
particular characteristics of these two crops. The identification of differentially expressed transcripts offers a
starting point for the correlation between gene expression profiles and Coffea spp. developmental traits,
providing valuable insights for coffee breeding and biotechnology, especially concerning sugar metabolism
and stress tolerance.

Background
Coffee is the most important agricultural commodity in
the world and is responsible for nearly half of the total
exports of tropical products [1]. Indeed, coffee is an
important source of income for many developing tropical countries. Brazil, Vietnam and Colombia account for
> 50% of global coffee-production. In addition, coffee is
also important to many non-tropical countries that are
highly involved in coffee industrialization and commerce
and are intensive consumers of coffee beverages.
Two species of the genus Coffea are responsible for
almost all coffee bean production: C. arabica and C.
canephora (approximately 70 and 30% of worldwide
production, respectively). C. arabica is an autogamous
allotetraploid (amphidiploid; 2n = 4× = 44) species originating from a relatively recent cross (≅1 mya) between
C. canephora (or a canephoroide-related species) and C.
eugenioides, which occurred in the plateaus of Central
Ethiopia [2,3]. As a consequence of its autogamy and
evolutionary history, “Arabica” coffee plants have a narrow genetic basis. This problem is amplified in the main
cultivated genotypes (i.e., Mundo Novo, Catuai and
Caturra), which were selected from only two base populations: Typica and Bourbon [4]. Conversely, C. canephora is a diploid (2n = 2× = 22), allogamous and more
polymorphic Coffea species. In contrast to C. arabica,
which is grown in highland environments, C. canephora
is better adapted to warm and humid equatorial lowlands. C. arabica is regarded as having a better cup
quality, which seems to depend on the quality and
amount of compounds stored in the seed endosperm
during bean maturation [5-7]. Conversely, C. canephora
is considered more resistant to diseases and pests and
has a higher caffeine content than C. arabica [8]. Other
important differences are related to fruit maturation.
Though C. canephora blossoms earlier, its fruit maturation is delayed in comparison to C. arabica [9].
Improvements in the agronomic characteristics of coffee
(e.g., cup quality, pathogen and insect resistance and
drought stress tolerance) are long-sought by the coffee
farming-community. However, the introduction of a
new trait into an elite coffee variety via conventional
breeding techniques is a lengthy process due to the narrow genetic basis of C. arabica [4,10] and the long seedto-seed generation cycle.
Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) provide a source for
the discovery of new genes and for comparative analyses
between organisms. Many EST sequencing efforts have
successfully provided insights into crop plants development [11-18]. EST sequencing allows quantitative
expression analyses by correlating EST frequency with
the desirable traits of plant species. It also constitutes an
interesting tool for the detection of tissue/stress specific

Page 2 of 22

promoters and genetic variation that may account for
specific characteristics. Furthermore, EST analyses can
provide targets for transgenesis, an interesting tool for
genetic improvement of such a long generation time
crop as coffee. In fact, data in coffee genetic transformation indicate the potential of this approach in molecular
breeding [19,20].
Research on coffee genomics and transcriptomics has
gained increasing attention recently. A Brazilian consortium (Brazilian Coffee Genome Project; BCGP) [21] was
developed to investigate coffee traits by sequencing
cDNA derived from a series of tissues of C. arabica, C.
canephora and C. racemosa, a coffee species used in
breeding programs for the introgression of resistance
against coffee leaf miner. Concomitantly, an initiative
from the Nestlé Research Center and the Department of
Plant Biology at Cornell University sequenced ESTs
from C. canephora farm-grown in east Java, Indonesia.
This research group compared the EST repertoires of C.
canephora, Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) and Arabidopsis thaliana [22,23]. Based on their analysis, it was
verified that C. canephora and tomato have a similar
assembly of genes, which is in agreement with their
similar genome size, chromosome karyotype, and chromosome architecture [22]. In addition, an important
platform for functional genomics that can be applied to
coffee was carried out by the SOL Genomics Network
(SGN; http://sgn.cornell.edu), a genomics information
resource for the Solanaceae family and related families
in the Asterid clade, such as Coffea spp. and other
Rubiaceae species [23].
The availability of EST data from both of the commercially most important Coffea spp. prompted us to perform a wide bioinformatics analysis. In this report, we
surveyed the coffee transcriptome by analyzing ESTs
from C. arabica and C. canephora. Resources developed
in this project provide genetic and genomic tools for
Coffea spp. evolution studies and for comparative analyses between C. arabica and C. canephora, regarding
gene families’ expansion and gene ontology. We also
identified Coffea-specific/prominent gene families using
automatic orthology analysis. Additionally, we describe
the annotation of differentially expressed genes according to in silico analysis of EST frequencies.

Results and Discussion
Overall Coffea spp. EST libraries data

To evaluate ESTs from Coffea spp. we collected 187,412
ESTs derived from 43 cDNA libraries produced by the
Brazilian Coffee Genome Project initiative [21]. The
C. arabica libraries represent diverse organs, plant
developmental stages and stress treatments from Mundo
Novo and Catuaí cultivars, excluding germinating seeds

(cv Rubi) (Additional File 1). In the case of C. canephora, 62,823 ESTs from six cDNA libraries of the Nestlé and Cornell C. canephora sequencing initiative [22]
and 15,647 C. canephora ESTs from three cDNA
libraries constructed by the Brazilian Coffee Genome
Project initiative [21] were collected yielding a total of
78,470 ESTs (Additional File 1). All ESTs were produced
by the Sanger method, and cDNA clones were subjected
only to 5’ sequencing. The pipeline of C. arabica and C.
canephora EST analysis is described in Figure 1.
After trimming (i.e., vector, ribosomal, short, low quality
and E. coli contaminant sequences removal), 135,876 C.
arabica ESTs were assembled into 17,443 contigs and
17,710 singlets (35,113 clusters; Figure 1), and the C.
canephora ESTs were assembled into 8,275 contigs and
9,732 singlets (18,007 clusters; Figure 1). After manual
annotation, we detected some clusters similar to bacterial sequences that were not identified during trimming.
Clusters were then evaluated using BLASTN against a
version of NT-bac and BLASTX against the NR database. Sequences similar to bacteria were removed from
further analyses. These sequences are likely derived
from endophytes of coffee plants. After their removal
from the dataset, the final number of clusters was
32,007 (15,656 contigs and 16,351 singlets) from C. arabica and 16,665 (7,710 contigs and 8,955 singlets) from

Page 3 of 22

C. canephora (Table 1). The average length of C. canephora and C. arabica clusters in the dataset was 662 bp
(ranging from 100 to 3,584 bp) and 663 bp (ranging
from 100 to 2,988 bp), respectively (Table 1). The number of ESTs in the C. canephora and C. arabica contigs
ranged from 2 to 1,395 and 2 to 493, respectively
(Figure 2). In both cases, approximately 63% were composed of ≤ 20 ESTs, and 98% of the contigs contained <
50 ESTs. We also verified the distribution of ESTs in
contigs across multiple libraries. Nineteen percent of
C. arabica contigs and 4% of C. canephora contigs were
found in only one library (Additional File 2). The majority of C. arabica contigs (32%) have only two ESTs, each
one from a different EST library. Due to the limited
depth of sequencing and the variety of tissue samples
used to construct the C. arabica libraries, a smoother
distribution of contigs per library was observed in comparison with C. canephora (Additional File 2).
Evaluation of GC content, SNPs and sequence similarity
with other species

We evaluated the structure of Coffea contigs to identify
the percentage of coding sequences (CDS) in our dataset
using the QualitySNP program tools [24]. The mode
and median length of CDS and 5’ and 3’ UTRs were
similar to both species (Table 2). We also inspected the

Figure 1 Flow diagram of bioinformatics procedures applied in C. arabica and C. canephora transcriptomic analyses.

amount of full length CDS in our dataset, resulting in
1,189 contigs in C. arabica (8%) and 518 contigs in
C. canephora (7%; Table 2).
Based on the annotation of CDS, we evaluated the GC
content in coding regions. In general, the GC and GC3
profiles (i.e., the GC level at the third codon position) of
C. canephora and C. arabica are similar to Arabidopsis
and tomato. The unimodal GC distribution is a common feature of dicotyledons (Figure 3), whereas bimodal
distribution is common in monocotyledons [17,25].
Nevertheless, Coffea spp.and Arabidopsis have a slightly
higher proportion of genes with high GC content than
tomato and have a more accentuated peak shift in GC3
content (Figure 3). This difference between Arabidopsis
and tomato was found previously [25] and was attributed to differences in the gene samples, such as the presence of intron-retained transcripts (differentially spliced
transcripts) in tomato. A more detailed inspection
revealed that C. arabica has only one GC3 peak, while
C. canephora has two close peaks: the first similar to
that found for C. arabica and the other positioned
toward the “GC-rich content area”. This C. canephora
pattern may be related to its outcrossing mating system
because allogamous species tend to accumulate more
polymorphism in the third codon position and to be
more GC-rich than autogamous species [26], as is the
case of Arabica coffee, tomato and Arabidopsis.
We also used QualitySNP to calculate SNPs present in
C. arabica and C. canephora contigs. In the case of
C. arabica, we selected contigs containing at least four
reads, which in theory provide two copies for each allele,

yielding 8,514 C. arabica and 3,832 C. canephora
contigs. Approximately 53% (4,535) of the C. arabica
contigs and 52% (2,000) of the C. canephora contigs
were found to contain SNPs (Additional File 3). Similar
to other reports [27-29], more transitions than transversions were found for both species (Additional File 3),
likely reflecting the high frequency of cytosine to
thymine mutation after methylation. The frequency of
SNPs in C. arabica was 0.35 SNP/100 bp, almost double
the C. canephora SNP frequency (0.19 SNP/100 bp).
Similarly, Lashermes et al. [3] and Vidal et al. [30]
indicated that Arabica has a level of internal genetic
variability almost twice that present in C. canephora.
The majority of polymorphisms found in both species
was bi-allelic (99.8% for C. arabica and 99.5% for
C. canephora), with a low percentage of tri-allelic and
no tetra-allelic SNPs (Additional File 3)
We next used AutoFACT [31] to evaluate the putative
functions of the two Coffea datasets. The results of
BLASTX against the non-redundant protein sequence
database (NR; E-value cutoff of 1e-10) available at AutoFACT were inspected to evaluate the similarity of Coffea
clusters with proteins deposited in GenBank. Approximately 68% of C. arabica and 71% of C. canephora clusters
have significant sequence similarity (E-value ≤ 1e-10) with
genes in the databank. The remaining clusters represented
sequences with lower E-value scores (E-value > 1e -10 )
designated as “no-hits” (Table 3). Because C. arabica and
C. canephora are species from the Rubiaceae family, which
have few sequences deposited in the NR database, we
expected that sequences from other species in the Asteridae clade (e.g., members of the Solanaceae family S. lycopersicum, S. tuberosum and Nicotiana tabacum) would be
the most similar to Coffea sequences. However, the majority of Coffea clusters have higher similarity with Vitis vinifera sequences (~40%), a species from the Rosids clade,
followed by the other rosids Arabidopsis (~5.5%) and
Populus trichocarpa (~3.5%). The top hits of Coffee
sequences with Solanaceae range from 1 to 2% (Table 3).
We then compared the Coffea sequences with a database
containing contigs from the plant EST databank TIGR, the
plant transcript database http://plantta.jcvi.org and GeneIndex Plants http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/plant.html,
which have a higher amount of Solanaceae data. For both
C. arabica and C. canephora, N. tabacum was the species
with more top hits (11.15 and 11.59%, respectively), followed by V. vinifera (10.34 and 10.03%), S. lycopersicum
(6.5 and 5%) and S. tuberosum (5 and 4.8%; data not

shown). We believe that the most parsimonious hypothesis
for these results is related to phylogenetic issues. Grape is
basal to the rosids clade and did not undergo whole genome duplication (WGD) events, such as Arabidopsis, thus
being theoretically more similar to the rosids paleohexaploid ancestor [32,33]. Analysis of genomic sequences from
the asterid common monkey flower (Mimulus guttatus)
revealed extensive synteny with grape, suggesting that
paleohexaploidy antedates the divergence of the rosid and
asterid clades [33]. Notably, recent data prove that there is
a high level of collinearity between diploid Coffea and
V. vinifera genomic regions [34], and that these species
derive from the same paleohexaploid ancestral genome
[35]. Intensive genomic analyses are currently underway to
more deeply compare the genomes of rosids and asterids
species.
To gain insight into the molecular evolution of protein
coding genes in the two Coffea species analyzed, we estimated the rates of synonymous (KS, silent mutation)

3’UTR length (median)

and non-synonymous (KA, amino-acid altering mutation) substitutions generated by QualitySNP analysis,
and performed the KA/KS test for positive selection of
each hypothetical gene. KA/KS is a good indicator of
selective pressure at the sequence level. Theoretically, a
KA/KS >1 indicates that the rate of evolution is higher
than the neutral rate. Conversely, a gene with KA/KS <
1 has a rate of evolution less than the neutral rate [36].
As in other plant species [37,38], most genes in C. arabica and C. canephora appear to be under purifying
selection (KA/KS < 1), indicating that the majority of
protein-coding genes are conserved over time as a result
of selection against deleterious variants.

The correlation between AutoFACT annotations with
KA/KS analysis allowed the detection of genes with low
KA/KS ratios, such as those encoding proteins involved
in photosynthesis, morphogenetic development and
translation (Additional File 4). The majority of these
proteins have been shown to be highly conserved and to
suffer strong purifying selection [37]. Analyzing the
genes with the highest KA/KS, we identified effector
proteins and transcription factors related to biotic and
abiotic stress and proteins involved in oxidative respiration (Additional File 4). These results are in accordance
with previous reports, which show that genes acting in
response to stress are often positively selected for
diversification due to the competition with the evolving
effector proteins of pathogens [37,39].
Metabolic Pathways

We constructed hypothetical metabolic maps for both
C. arabica and C. canephora using BioCyc [40]. After
manual annotation, 345 pathways in C. arabica and 300
pathways in C. canephora were detected. C. arabica pathways included 3,366 enzymes in 1,807 enzymatic reactions. In the case of C. canephora, 1,889 enzymes were
present in 1,653 enzymatic reactions. The almost twofold difference in the number of enzymes between the
two coffee species is related to the number of ESTs annotated for each species. Therefore, assigning the presence/
absence of a pathway in one Coffea species relative to the
other should be done carefully. Further, the number of C.
arabica enzymatic reactions may be underestimated due
to duplicated genes in C. arabica, each one most likely
derived from a different ancestor (C. canephora and
C. eugenioides), because that two enzymatic reactions in
C. arabica may be annotated as only one. The data for
the fully annotated pathways are available at the website
http://www.lge.ibi.unicamp.br/coffea.

histogram. Protein domain analysis revealed significant
differences between the two species datasets (Figure 4).
For example, C. arabica contains more cytochrome P450
monooxygenases, tyrosine kinases, extensin-like proteins,
glycine-rich proteins, sugar transporters, UDP glucosyltransferases, NAD-dependent epimerases, DNA-J proteins, NB-ARC proteins, cellulose synthases, raffinose
synthases, D-mannose-binding lectins and flavin amine
oxidoreductases than C. canephora (Figure 4). In contrast, the C. canephora dataset contains a higher percentage of transcripts coding for proteins containing RRM
motifs, ubiquitin conjugation enzymes, ABC transporters,
Ras/Rab/Rac proteins, 2-OG oxygenases, cupin proteins,
HSP20 s, HSP70 s, ADP-ribosylation factors, dehydrins,
glutenins and seed maturation proteins (Figure 4).
Despite these dissimilarities between datasets may be
caused by the different tissues used for constructing the
C. arabica and C. canephora cDNA libraries, such results
offer clues for further comparative research.
One noteworthy difference between domains is the
greater percentage of proteins containing the retrotransposon gag protein domain (Pfam03732) in C. canephora (0.26%) than in C. arabica (0.02%). This domain
is found in LTR-retrotransposons, the most widespread
transposable element (TE) family in plants [41]. Lopes
et al. [42] found that Coffea species harbor fewer
TE-cassettes (> 0.04%) than would be expected from the
translation of TE-containing transcripts (0.23%). These
authors hypothesized that such incongruence may either
be a consequence of the exonization/exaptation of
TE fragments or an indication of the tolerance of
alternatively spliced “TE-invaded” mRNAs that do
not encode functional proteins. A more detailed
investigation is in progress to explore the diversity and
differences between Coffea spp. TEs (F.R. Lopes, M.F.
Carazzolle, G.A.G. Pereira, C.A. Colombo, C.M.A. Carareto; unpublished data).

Protein Domains

We performed a comparison of C. arabica and C. canephora gene clusters with the CDD-PFAM databank to
catalog the protein domains present in the Coffea EST
datasets. The submission of the clusters to RPS-BLAST
resulted in 30% (9,886) of C. arabica and 32% (5,478) of
C. canephora clusters containing an assigned domain. To
compare the prevalence of protein domains in Coffea
species, the number of clusters assigned to each domain
was normalized by dividing by the total number of clusters containing a domain. Serine threonine kinases
(Pfam00069), cytochrome P450 monooxygenases
(Pfam00067), tyrosine kinases (Pfam07714) and proteins
containing RNA recognition motifs (RRM; Pfam00076)
are among the top 20 PFAM families in Coffea species
(Additional File 5). Next, we plotted the percentage of
protein domains in Coffea datasets in a comparative

Gene Ontology Analysis and Annotation

A functional annotation was performed by mapping
contigs assembling onto gene ontology (GO) structures
[43]. Approximately 38% of C. arabica and 49% of C.
canephora clusters were mapped with a biological process, and 43 and 55% were mapped with a molecular
function. These differences reflect the greater amount of
C. arabica ESTs in the libraries compared to C. canephora and are likely related to the fact that some tissues
used in C. arabica libraries (i.e., callus) were not extensively studied, resulting in genes with unassigned ontologies. To compare the gene ontologies, the amount of
sequences associated with each term was normalized
(see methods), and then hypergeometric statistics were
applied [44]. To compare GO data with our other protein-related analysis, we focused our evaluation on

molecular activity ontology. We observed that C. arabica has a greater amount of transcripts coding for proteins with catalytic activity, transferase activity and
transporter activity than C. canephora (Figure 5). In
accordance, the CDD-PFAM analyses showed that C.
arabica had a greater percentage of cellulose synthases,
raffinose synthases, UDP-glucuronosyl transferases, secondary metabolism-related transferases, ABC transporters and sugar transporters (Figure 4; Additional File 5).
The evidence that transcripts coding for proteins related
to sugar metabolism and transport are more prevalent
in C. arabica than in C. canephora may be related to
the high content of sugars (especially sucrose) in fruits
of Arabica plants, one of the traits that provides a better
cup quality (see below). In contrast to C. arabica, C.
canephora has more proteins annotated as containing
binding activity, which is extended for the binding activity branch child terms of nucleic acid binding, DNA and
RNA binding activities, transcription regulation and
transcription factor activities (Figure 5). These data are
also in agreement with our domain analysis (Figure 4;
Additional File 5), indicating a higher percentage of Ras/
Rac/Rab GTPase proteins, including regulators of vesicle

biogenesis in intracellular traffic, ADP-ribosylation factors and proteins containing RRM and G-patch motifs,
involved in RNA binding activity [45].

species, we applied OrthoMCL, a graph-clustering algorithm designed to identify homologous proteins based
on sequence similarity [46,47]. Two different types of
datasets were used in this analysis: i) the annotated proteins from the available complete genomes of A. thaliana, V. vinifera, Oryza sativa, Ricinus communis and
Glycine max and ii) the proteins predicted by FrameDP
software [48] from the available ESTs assemblies for C.
arabica, C. canephora and S. lycopersicum. Based on the
fact that some genes are not picked in EST libraries, the
evaluation of Coffea spp. gene family retraction was not
performed (i.e., the absence of a gene does not mean
that it is not present in the genome but rather that it is
expressed in a minor amount).
We identified 24,577 different families using the eight
aforementioned species. The majority of families were
ubiquitous, being present in all analyzed species. The
top three OrthoMCL families in Coffea spp. are: i) a
family composed of serine/threonine kinases (family 1),
ii) pentatricopeptide repeat-containing proteins (family
2) and iii) cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (family 6;
Table 4). The analysis was focused on the annotation of
families that appeared to be specific from Coffea species
or that are prominent in those EST datasets. In C. arabica, we highlight family 544, which contains proteins
similar to the cysteine proteinase inhibitors cystatins.
This family includes 21 members in C. arabica, six in C.
canephora and only one member in the grape genome
(Table 4). Two other proteins families composed of
cystatin-like proteins (families 2703 and 11594) are also
prominent in coffee plants. Other protein families that
appear to be prominent/specific in C. arabica include
small secreted glycine-rich proteins similar to Panax
ginseng [49] (families 1231, 4031 and 11588), NBS-LRR
resistance proteins (families 453, 3289 and 2722), Pin2like serine proteinase inhibitors (families 7241 and
10273), conserved proteins of unknown function
(families 10956, 11617, 12384, 12386, 11626 and 13353),
proteins not previously described (no hits; families
14110 and 14413), etc. (Table 4). In C. canephora, the
“species-specific/prominent” gene families include those
encoding miraculin-like proteins (family 14813), C.
canephora-specific invertase inhibitors (family 14814),
small secreted glycine-rich proteins (family 11055), Ty3
Gypsy-like retrotransposons (family 10952), kelch repeat
phosphatases (family 14392), 2 S albumin storage proteins (family 14392), etc. (Table 4). Five families are specific or prominent in both C. arabica and C. canephora
when compared to the other species analyzed. Two of
these contain proteins not previously described (no hits,
families 10281 and 12375). The other three include proteins similar to rapid alkalinization factor (RALF, family
8498), GTP binding proteins (family 9023) and prolinerich extensins (family 12371; Table 4).

In silico Evaluation of Gene Expression in C. arabica and
C. canephora

We correlated the AutoFACT annotation results with
the distribution of contigs in the C. arabica and C.
canephora libraries (Additional Files 6 and 7). The
majority of the most widely distributed genes is related
to RNA processing, translation, protein turnover and
protein folding. This was an expected result because
these biological processes are ubiquitous and indispensable for cellular homeostasis (Additional File 6). In Arabica, the most widely expressed contigs encode a
papain-like cysteine (cys) proteinase (234 ESTs) and a
polyubiquitin (207 ESTs), each one distributed among
30 libraries, followed by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH; 162 ESTs) and a heme-containing peroxidase (245 ESTs), both distributed among
29 libraries (Additional File 6). Both polyubiquitin and
GAPDH were previously tested as suitable reference
genes for qPCR expression analysis in C. Arabica
[50-52], which reinforces the accuracy of our bioinformatics analyses. The data presented here provide additional genes to be tested for normalization of qPCR, an
essential procedure to avoid misinterpretation when
measuring gene expression [53]. The lack of libraries
from diverse tissues does not allow reliable inferences
about the ubiquity of genes in C. canephora. However,
the most widely expressed contig (22 ESTs in nine
libraries) encodes a putative VTC2 protein, a GDP-Dglucose phosphorylase involved in ascorbic acid biosynthesis [54], suggesting the synthesis of ascorbate
throughout fruit development in C. canephora, which is
likely used as an antioxidant and as a cofactor for
dioxygenases.
The evaluation of the contigs distribution in Coffea
libraries also revealed the contigs containing the most
redundant (most highly expressed) ESTs (Additional File
7). In C. arabica, a contig encoding a RuBisCo small
subunit was found to be the most highly expressed
gene, followed by a contig encoding a putative class III
chitinase (Additional File 7). Among the top 20 most
expressed ESTs are genes involved in detoxification and
reactive oxygen species (ROS) tolerance and genes
related to biotic and abiotic stress. These annotations
may be biased by the significant amount of ESTs derived
from biotic or abiotic stressed tissues (Additional File 1).
Two genes encoding seed storage proteins (2 S albumin
and 11 S globulin) were the most highly expressed
genes in the C. canephora dataset, a result similar to
that described by Lin et al. [22] (Additional File 7). The
use of regulatory elements of these highly expressed
genes may be an excellent tool for conferring strong
expression to a target gene in transgenesis approaches.
To identify genes uniquely or preferentially expressed
in specific coffee EST libraries, R statistics [55] and

*Annotation based on BLASTX-NR (E-value 1e-5).

Audic Claverie (AC) statistics [56] were used through
IDEG6, a web tool for the statistical analysis of gene
expression data [57]. Libraries containing < 300 ESTs
were discarded from these analyses, because libraries
with a small amount of ESTs tend to disturb the prediction of differentially expressed genes. After some manual
clusterization, we observed that several libraries derived
from the same tissues (EA1, IA1 and IA2; EM1 and SI3;
LV4, LV5, LV8 and LV9; FB1 and FB4; and FR1 and FR2)
present the same set of genes differentially expressed in
comparison to the other libraries. Thus, they were combined for further analyses. After evaluating statistical
data, the merging of AC and R statistical analyses
resulted in 331 contigs from C. arabica and 443 contigs
from C. canephora. Thereafter, hierarchical clustering
was applied to this data using a correlation matrix constructed from EST frequencies for differentially expressed

C. arabica and C. canephora contigs (Figure 6; Additional File 8). The clustering results indicated that the
differences among C. canephora libraries were more evident than in C. arabica, likely due to the small number
of libraries of the former (Figure 6A and 6B).
The libraries were manually separated into two
groups: “development” libraries, derived from tissues
that did not suffer stress; and “stress” libraries that were
constructed using RNA from plants challenged with biotic or abiotic stress-triggering factors. This expression
“fingerprinting” provides a guideline for the isolation of
promoters that regulate expression in specific tissues or
stress conditions. Brandalise et al. [58] applied a similar
strategy in the isolation of a C. arabica promoter that
drives stress-responsive expression in leaves. Some
genes with agronomical importance or with interesting
expression profiles depicted in Figure 6 are discussed in

Functional Classification of Differentially Expressed Genes
and Prevalent Protein Families in C. arabica and C.
canephora

Based on the results of protein domain annotation, GO
analysis, OrthoMCL data and Expression Hierarchical
Clustering, we established functional categories to elucidate putative gene expression and its consequences in
coffee development and environmental adaptations.
Genes related to plant defense
Pathogenesis related proteins (PR)

PRs are a heterogeneous group of plant proteins, inducible
by biotic stresses [59,60]. Some of these proteins are effectors against pathogens and insects, while others are
involved in reestablishing homeostasis after the stress [59].
Defensins or gamma-thionins (PR-12) are small, cationic, Cys-rich proteins structurally and functionally related
to biocide defensins previously characterized in mammals
and insects [61]. All EST reads that compose contigs
encoding gamma-thionins from OrthoMCL family 12385
were expressed in tissues treated with benzothiadiazole BTH (BP1, CL2) or infected with nematodes (NS1). This
OrthoMCL family was C. arabica-specific (Table 4), perhaps due to the lack of EST libraries from C. canephora
plants treated with BTH. However, their specificity in Arabica suggests that these proteins rapidly evolved in Coffea
spp., acquiring specific structural traits important for Coffea adaptation to pathogens.
The PR-10 protein family is a large group of PR proteins that are considered allergenic and exert ribonuclease activity, which is paralleled with cytokinin binding
and anti-pathogenic roles [62]. In C. arabica, a PR-10
was found to be highly expressed in an incompatible
reaction against the causative agent of coffee leaf rust,
the biotrophic fungus Hemileia vastatrix [63]. A PR-10
from C. arabica (CaContig15067) was predicted to be
more expressed in suspension cells treated with aluminum (Additional File 8). Concerning C. canephora, we
observed an expression prevalence of PR-10 genes in

late stages of fruit development (SE3 e SE4; Additional
File 8). A proteomic analysis indicated that a C. arabica
PR-10 was expressed only in the endosperm but not in
zygotic embryos [64]. This result is similar to that found
by Botton et al. [65], who reported the accumulation of
a peach PR-10 during the fruit ripening stage.
One interesting result was the presence of a relatively
large amount of chitinases (four contigs) and thaumatins
(six contigs) in C. arabica calli libraries (PC1, EA1, IA1,
IA2 and PA1; Additional File 8; Figure 6B). Several
reports indicate the participation of these PR proteins
not only in plant defense but also during somatic
embryogenesis [66-69]. The chitinases are hypothesized
to have signaling functions during embryogenesis,
because these proteins are able to rescue somatic
embryos beyond globular stage [70]. Moreover, arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), chitinases and thaumatins
secreted in suspension-culture cells can promote the
production of somatic embryos [69,71]. Our data
strongly indicate a role for these PRs during coffee
embryogenesis.
Resistance Genes

Most of the disease resistance genes (R genes) in plants
encode nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBSLRR) proteins. They are engaged in the recognition of
pathogens, being considered specific determinants of the
plant immune response [72,73]. Upon annotation of
OrthoMCL gene families, we detected 91 clusters and 36
clusters of CC-NBS-LRR proteins in C. arabica and C.
canephora, respectively. In addition, some CC-NBS-LRR
families were prevalent in C. arabica (Families 453, 3289,
2722) and in C. canephora (Family 6375; Table 4). The
majority of clusters have higher identity with the PRF
protein from tomato (with the exception of CaContig16622, which is more similar to RPP8 and LOV1 proteins). In a seminal report concerning the evaluation of
resistance genes in coffee, 43 resistance gene analogues
(RGAs) from both C. arabica and C. canephora were isolated, and it was verified that all RGAs are from the CCNBS-LRR subfamily [74]. Nevertheless, we identified a C.
arabica contig analogous to TIR-NBS-LRR proteins
(CaContig7327), with similarity to the nematode resistance potato proteins Gro1 [75] and Arabidopsis TAO1

Mondego et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:30
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/30

protein [76]. The extensive retraction (almost disappearance) of Coffea spp. TIR-NBS-LRR proteins is similar to
that described in cereals and sugar beet [77,78] and likely
resulted from independent gene loss events in such different plant lineages [74,77,78]. The implications of the
loss of TIR-type NBS-LRR genes and diversification of
CC-NBS-LRRs deserve special attention in the understanding of coffee defense mechanisms.
Genes Related to Abiotic Stress and Detoxification

Genes related to abiotic stresses are potentially important in the recent scenario of harsh environmental
changes, such as the increase of extreme temperatures
and drought periods. Coffee plantations are threatened
by global warming due to coffee’s susceptibility to high
temperatures and drought when these stresses occurs
during flowering and fruit development [79]. The understanding of the relationship between tolerance/susceptibility mechanisms and abiotic stress is essential for the
prospection of biotechnological and crop management
strategies in coffee.
We inspected the genes that were more expressed in C.
arabica drought stressed plants (SH2) in comparison to
well-watered plants conditions (SS1). Genes encoding
RuBisCo activases (CaContig 5581 and 14729), a putative
photosystem II type I chlorophyll a/b-binding (CAB) protein (CaContig5621) and a PSI-E subunit of photosystem
I (CaContig5564) were preferentially expressed in the
SH2 library (Additional File 8; Figure 6). Cramer et al.
[80] also found similar expression patterns with RuBisCo
activase and CAB proteins during water and salinity
stresses in grapevines. In drought stress, RuBisCo activase augments RuBisCo activity that is diminished as a
consequence of a lower stomatal conductance caused by
diffusion limitations through stomata and mesophyll
[80]. Damages in PSII proteins are associated with the
decrease of PSII chemistry caused by ROS [81]. The
increase of photosystem I and II genes (CAB and PSI-E
subunit) may be a mechanism to sustain photosystems
susceptible to ROS attack [80]. These results indicate
that the activation of the photosynthetic apparatus is a
mechanism of drought stress mitigation in coffee plants.
Catalase controls H 2O2 concentrations by dismuting
H2O2 to water and oxygen. Montavon and Bortlik [82]
detected increasing of catalase activity throughout coffee
grain maturation. Among genes preferentially expressed
in SH2 (Additional File 8; Figure 6A) CaContig13838 has
similarity to Arabidopsis catalase 2, which is activated by
drought stresses [83], supporting its involvement in the
dehydration response in C. arabica. Another contig preferentially expressed in the SH2 library (CaContig13998)
is similar to early light-induced proteins (ELIPs), thylakoid-target proteins that are similar to light harvesting
complex (LHC) proteins (Additional File 8; Figure 6B).

Page 13 of 22

ELIPs are reported to be up-regulated during various
environmental stresses, such as cold and drought, and
during fruit ripening [84,85]. ABA/WDS are proteins Cterminally enriched in His and Lys and are induced during ripening in pummel [86] and under water deficit
stress in loblolly pine [87]. CaContig1691 appears to be
one of the most expressed in water deficit stressed plants
(Additional File 8; Figure 6B).
Other genes encoding proteins related to drought
stress, such as dehydrins, metallothioneins and LEAs,
were not differentially expressed in the SH2 library.
However, we detected interesting profiles for these
genes, especially for dehydrins and LEAs during fruit
maturation and for metallothioneins preferentially
expressed in libraries from plants treated with arachidonic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid present in pathogens (further details in Additional File 9).
Plant Hormones: Auxin Regulation Genes and RALF-like
Peptides

Plant hormones (phytohormones) are crucial for a series
of developmental mechanisms, such as organ initiation
and development, resistance to stress and reproduction.
Auxins are the most studied class of phytohormones,
being implicated in cell division, cell elongation and cell
differentiation [88]. Using OrthoMCL analysis, we identified a family of GH3-like proteins that is expanded in
C. arabica (Family 9014; Table 4). GH3 enzymes conjugate amino acids to the auxin indole-3-acetic (IAA),
decreasing the concentration of free auxin [89]. This
mechanism is important in the regulation of IAA availability in plants. We also detected a family of Aux/IAA
proteins that is prominent in C. arabica (Family 770;
Table 4). Aux/IAA proteins have been shown to function as negative regulators of gene expression mediated
by auxin response factor (ARF). A gene similar to auxin
receptor TIR1 that promotes ubiquitin (Ub)-mediated
degradation of Aux/IAA repressors was identified in
C. arabica (CaContig 593). In addition, we also detected
another putative auxin receptor in C. arabica, ABP1
(CaContig16576), a cupin-like protein that is implicated
in early auxin responses [90].
Together with small lipophilic “classical phytohormones,” small peptides have been described as factors
involved in plant growth regulation [91]. Rapid alkalinization factor (RALF) is a small peptide initially isolated in
tobacco that induces a rapid alkalinization in cell suspension and inhibits root growth in tomato and Arabidopsis
seedlings [92]. Based on BLAST searching, we found a
family of RALF peptides in C. arabica (two members)
and C. canephora (five members). However, the evaluation of OrthoMCL families revealed that coffee has a particular family of small peptides slightly similar to RALFs
(Family 8498; Table 4). These proteins contain the four

Mondego et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:30
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/30

cysteines in their C-termini required for RALF activity
but are richest in Trp. Further, some members do not
contain the conserved dibasic site (Additional File 10),
which is essential for processing tomato and Arabidopsis
RALFs [92-94]. The isolation and functional analysis of
these coffee proteins/peptides constitute an important
approach in order to verify whether they exert the same
growth retarding effect as RALFs.
Glycine-Rich Proteins

The glycine-rich protein (GRP) superfamily is a large
complex of plant proteins that share the presence of glycine-rich domains arranged in (Gly)n-X repeats [95].
Generally considered as involved in protein-protein
interactions, GRPs have diverse functions and structural
domains [96]. Evaluating hierarchical clusterization data,
we found that several GRPs are preferentially expressed
in suspension cells treated with BTH, brassinosteroids
and NaCl, as well as in embryogenic calli (Additional
File 8). Those genes encode GRPs from Class I, which
may contain a signal peptide for secretion followed by a
glycine-rich region with GGGX repeats [95]. Other
GRPs (CaContigs 1089, 3317, 10126) were found to be
differentially expressed in plantlets and leaves treated
with arachidonic acid (Additional File 8). These genes
encode proteins containing signal peptides and are similar to class II GRPs, which contain a peptide motif rich
in cysteine and tyrosine residues located in their C-termini [95]. However, a deeper annotation revealed that
these coffee GRPs contain 12 cysteines instead of the six
cysteines of the aforementioned class II GRPs (Additional File 11). These cysteine-rich domain proteins,
such as class II AtGRP-3 and NtTLRP, were shown to
interact with receptor protein kinase WAK1 [97] and to
mediate the cross-linking of proteins to the cell wall
[98]. We also detected the presence of some “specific”
GRP OrthoMCL families in coffee (Table 4). Family
1231 is composed of class I GRPs, while family 4011 has
GRPs from class II that contain six to 10 cysteines
(Additional File 11). The diversification of GRPs in coffee is quite remarkable, especially in Class II and is
probably important to coffee cell wall dynamics and signal transduction.

predicted secondary-helix structure [99]. Family 544 of
hypothetical PhyCys was prevalent in coffee plants, containing 21 members in C. arabica and six members in C.
canephora (Table 4). Proteins from family 544 are ≅ 10
kDa, contain a variation of the LARFAV-like domain and
do not contain the canonical reactive site QxVxG but
have a GG-X-YY motif (Additional File 12). Other
OrthoMCL families (2703 and 942) were annotated as
containing putative cystatins prevalent in coffee (Table 4;
Additional File 12). All members of those three families
have low but significant identities (30-40%) with hypothetical cystatins from Arabidopsis (At5g47550), grape
(XP_002274494.1) and Brassica oleracea (ABD64972).
Two C. canephora members from those families (CcContigs 7844 and 3825) were highly expressed in leaves from
water deficit stressed plants (SH3; Additional File 8;
Figure 6A). The majority of these new coffee cystatins do
not have signal peptides (Additional File 12), likely being
responsible for the regulation of endogenous protein
turnover as hypothesized for alfalfa and barley cystatins
[101,102]. In a recent phylogenomic analysis, it was proposed that cystatins had undergone a complex and
dynamic evolution through gene losses and duplications
[103]. This assignment may explain the expansion of
cystatins in coffee and may indicate functional diversification of these proteins.
Members of the Potato type II (PotII) inhibitors (Pin2)
family are PIs restricted to plants that belong to the
MEROPS inhibitor family I20, clan IA [104]. Several
Pin2 proteins have a multi-domain structure. However,
sequences from coffee-prevalent proteins of OrthoMCL
families 7241 and 10273 appear to be uni-domain Pin2
proteins (Additional File 13). Although we did not find
any of the coffee Pin2 genes preferentially expressed in
EST libraries of stressed plants, predicted coffee Pin2
proteins contain signal peptides and, additionally, have
30-40% identity with a Pin2 protein of tobacco that confers tolerance to NaCl and resistance against herbivorous insects in transgenic plants [105]. In addition to the
fact that PI expansions may be related to biotic stress
regulation, PIs may also have an important role in proteolysis during coffee fruit development because the
peptides and amino acids are precursors of coffee flavor
and aroma (see below).

Proteinase Inhibitors (PIs)

The phytocystatins (PhyCys) are 12- to 16-kDa plant proteinaceous inhibitors of Cys-proteases of the papain C1A
family [99,100]. All cystatins contain three motifs
involved in the interaction with their target enzymes: the
reactive site QxVxG, one or two glycine residues in the
N-terminal part of the protein, and an A/PW located
downstream of the reactive site. In addition, PhyCys
contain a consensus sequence ([LVI]-[AGT]-[RKE][FY]-[AS]-[VI]-x-[EDQV]-[HYFQ]-N) that conforms to a

Coffee Cup Quality Related Genes

Coffee cup quality is a complex trait that is being unraveled. The components of coffee endosperm are the
source of the precursors of aroma and flavor after roasting. The degradation of sucrose and cell wall polysaccharides generate reducing sugars, which react with
amino acids during roasting through Maillard glycation
reactions. This reaction gives rise to aromatic products,
such as pyrazines, furans and aliphatic acids, which are

Mondego et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:30
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/30

associated with pleasant flavor and aroma [106]. Conversely, the bitterness of coffee is related to caffeine and
chlorogenic acid content in coffee beans [107]. During
our annotation, we give a panorama of genes related to
coffee cup quality that were, by some means, emphasized in at least one of our bioinformatics analyses.
Genes Related to Carbohydrate Metabolism

Due to the importance of the amount and composition
of carbohydrates to the final quality of the coffee beverage, the study of coffee bean carbohydrate synthesis and
degradation is intense [5-7,108-112]. Coffee bean cell
walls are mainly made of galactomannans, arabinogalactans and cellulose [108]. One interesting finding in our
analysis was the prevalence of cellulose synthase superfamily proteins (pfam 03552; CesA) in C. arabica in
relation to C. canephora (Figure 5 Additional File 5).
CesA proteins interact in a cellulose synthase complex,
and it is believed that each cell type contains three types
of CesA subunits in a single complex [113]. Therefore,
the broader origin of C. arabica ESTs may be the reason
for the prevalence of C. arabica CesAs in comparison to
C. canephora. The CesA family includes the “true” cellulose synthase genes and eight other families named ‘cellulose synthase-like’ genes CslA-CslH [114]. It was
verified that some CslA proteins act in the synthesis of
mannans and xyloglucans [112,115,116]. The orthologs
of these Csl genes were found in our C. arabica EST
data (CaContigs 3405 and 11680).
It is considered that the role of carbohydrates in the
differences in cup quality between C. arabica and C.
canephora is related to low molecular weight carbohydrate content, especially sucrose [117]. Arabica grains
have a higher amount of sucrose (7.3-11.4%) than C.
canephora grains (4-5%). Though sucrose is almost
completely degraded during coffee bean roasting (0.42.8% dry weight), sucrose remains are thought to
improve coffee sweetness and cup quality [118]. Privat
et al. [6] found that the synthesis of sucrose phosphate
synthase (SPS) was higher in late stages of C. arabica
grains than in C. canephora, and invertase activity was
lower in Arabica, likely due to the higher expression of
invertase inhibitors in this species, justifying the higher
sucrose content in C. arabica beans. Based on BLAST
and OrthoMCL analysis, we found that Invertase Inhibitor 3 (InvI3) is part of a Coffea spp.-specific protein
family (Family 14814; Table 4). These proteins have 2030% identity to Zea mays invertase inhibitors from the
pectin-methylesterase family [6,119,120]. We did not
detect C. arabica ESTs encoding InvI3, likely due to the
low coverage of fruit/seed libraries of this species. The
presence of such a particular InvI in coffee may indicate
new molecular mechanisms of invertase regulation.
The raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs) are soluble galactosyl-sucrose carbohydrates such as raffinose,

Page 15 of 22

stachyose and verbascose. Their participation in coffee
seed development was assessed by Joet et al. [7], who
indicated that RFOs were transiently present during the
storage phase and remobilized during mid-stages of
development to supply the extensive demand for galactose in galactomannan synthesis. Raffinose synthases
(RS; EC 2.4.1.82) catalyze the synthesis of raffinose from
sucrose and galactinol [121]. Our CDD-PFAM analysis
indicated that C. arabica has a larger amount of RS
than C. canephora (Figure 5). Such data seem to corroborate biochemical analyses that showed that grains
from C. canephora contain reduced raffinose levels in
comparison to Arabica [122,123]. A more careful
inspection of RS C. arabica clusters revealed that these
sequences were derived from diverse tissue libraries.
The presence of more EST libraries from stressed plants
in C. arabica may be the cause of such bias, because
RFO accumulation has been associated with responses
to abiotic stresses, protecting cellular metabolism from
oxidative damage and drought [124,125]. Indeed, a
recent analysis indicated that three C. arabica RFO
synthase transcripts are induced by drought and saline
stress (T.B. Santos, I. G. Budzinski, C.J. Marur, C.L. Petkowicz, L.F. Pereira, L.G. Vieira; unpublished results).
Therefore, raffinose may exert dual functions in coffee:
galactose reservoirs in coffee grains and protective roles
in vegetative development.
It is assumed that the RFOs decrease in late stages of
coffee bean development are caused by a-D-Galactosidase (a-Gal; EC 3.2.1.22) activity. We identified three aGal-encoding genes as more expressed in the late stages
of C. canephora seed development (CcContigs 2650,
3171, 7083; Additional File 8; Figure 6A), data that
agree with previous findings verifying increased a-Gal
activity during in vitro germination of coffee beans
[126]. Together with a-Gal, b-mannosidases (EC
3.2.1.25) and Endo b-mannanase (EC 3.2.1.78) are
enzymes involved in the degradation of galactomannans
during germination of seeds. Despite the fine analysis of
C. arabica b-mannanases and a-Gal [109,126], there is
no biochemical analysis of b-mannosidases activity in
coffee of which we are aware. We found that b-mannosidases are preferentially expressed in germinating seeds
of C. arabica and C. canephora (CaContig 3009,
CcContig6678; Figure 6; Additional File 8), a similar pattern in comparison to a-Gal from C. canephora
(CcContig 6678; Additional File 8).
Amino Acid Content: Storage Protein Synthesis and
Protease Expression

As cited above, proteins and amino acids are also fundamental for the generation of flavor and aroma-related
Maillard-end products. In effect, the level of protein
synthesis during early fruit stages, the amount of seed
storage proteins (SSPs) in the endosperm and the

Mondego et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:30
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/30

relationship between proteinases and their inhibitors during seed development are all factors that determine the
amino acid content in mature beans. Examining the
expression profile of the SE2 library, we found a series of
ribosomal proteins expressed in this stage of seed
maturation (Figure 6A; Additional File 8), indicating an
intense cellular effort in translation. Many SSPs are
enriched in cysteines, which confer high stability to these
proteins, an important factor for storage proteins. These
cysteines are also a source of sulfur used in seed germination. Two genes involved in cysteine metabolism, protein
folding and sulfur metabolism were preferentially
expressed in the early stage of C. canephora seed maturation (SE2 library; Figure 6A). CcContigs 7827 and 99
encode a cysteine synthase (O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase)
(EC 4.2.99.8), an enzyme that synthesizes cysteine [127],
and a protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), an enzyme that
catalyzes the formation and breakage of disulfide bonds
between cysteine residues within proteins as they fold
[128], respectively.
In coffee, the Cupin family protein 11 S globulin
represents 45% of the total protein in the endosperm
(corresponding to 5-7% of coffee bean dry weight) [129]
and is probably one of the main sources of nitrogen
during coffee bean roasting. Our expression hierarchical
clustering analysis indicated that two 11 S globulin
genes were preferentially expressed in C. arabica fruit
libraries (CaContigs 12252 and13966; Additional File 8),
and one was more highly expressed in the late stages of
C. canephora seed development (i.e., 42 weeks after pollination) (CcContig 4069; Additional File 8). This contig
was the second most abundant in the C. canephora
database (Additional File 7) after a 2 S albumin (CcContig1385; Additional File 7). We also identified a cysteine
and an aspartic protease preferentially expressed in the
last phase of Arabica seed maturation (CaContigs 7768
and 8165; Additional File 8). The coincidence of expression profiles of important storage proteins such as 11 S
globulin and 2 S albumin together with proteinases is
an indication that the release of free amino acids or
small peptides that contribute to coffee cup quality can
occur in the final stage of coffee maturation.
Secondary Metabolism: Caffeine, Trigoneline and
Chlorogenic Acid

Other precursors of flavor and aroma in coffee are secondary metabolites, such as alkaloids (caffeine and trigoneline) and phenylpropanoid chlorogenic acid (CGA).
These three components, together with sucrose, seem to
be the main factors influencing coffee quality, because
sucrose and trigoneline enhance coffee quality, while
CGA and caffeine confer bitter taste [7,107,130-133].
The comparison between the two coffee species showed
that C. arabica has more trigoneline and sucrose, and
C. canephora contains more CGA and caffeine [131].

Despite intense annotation, our data did not reveal any
outstanding results concerning the differential expression of the genes in the metabolic pathways of these
compounds during fruit development or any interesting
difference between C. arabica and C. canephora plants.

Conclusion
We assembled ESTs from C. arabica and C. canephora
and applied a diverse array of bioinformatics tools to
extract information about gene content features, transcriptome changes and novel genes and gene families.
The results concerning the prevalence of proteins
related to sugar metabolism in C. arabica and signal
transduction in C. canephora can be correlated with
agronomical characteristics of each species due to the
better cup quality of C. arabica and the high tolerance
to specific stresses in C. canephora plants. Despite
knowing that comparisons between these Coffea species
data should be carefully inspected, our initiative established possible transcriptomic elements that could guide
the coffee scientific community in unraveling the molecular mechanisms that distinguish these two extremely
important Coffea species. In addition, the annotation of
coffee-specific/prominent genes adds new elements to
genomic initiatives that are searching for traits that
could differentiate coffee from other Asteridae species.
In a recent report, Vidal et al. [30] showed that C. arabica displays differential expression of homeologous
genes and suggested that C. arabica ancestral subgenomes encode proteins involved in different physiological mechanisms, adding a new element of investigation
concerning gene expression regulation in coffee plants.
All data presented here are available at http://www.lge.
ibi.unicamp.br/coffea. We believe that such data are a
valuable aid to the interpretation of coffee development,
providing insights that could help coffee breeding programs and indicating potential targets for functional
analysis and biotechnology products of such socially and
economically important species.
Methods
EST assembly and trimming

ESTs from C. arabica (187,142) and C. canephora
(78,470) were derived from 43 libraries collected by the
BCGP and from 8 libraries of C. canephora EST sequencing initiative of the Nestlé Research Center (8). The
Brazilian project sources were mainly two C. arabica
genotypes (Catuai and Mundo Novo, with the exception
of germinating seeds from cv. Rubi) and one C. canephora genotype (Conillon). The Cornell-Nestlé project
EST sources were five different varieties of C. canephora
[22]. Sequences were trimmed using BDTrimmer to
remove ribosomal sequences, polyA/T tails, low quality
sequences, vector sequences (UniVec database) and E.

Mondego et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:30
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/30

coli contaminants [134]. EST assembling was executed
using the CAP3 program, with a minimum similarity
threshold of 90% and a minimum overlap of 40 bases.
ESTs from each species were assembled separately, and
the genotypes were assembled together into the same
species. After the assembly, nucleic acid contamination
from bacterial organisms that were not removed during
trimming analysis (putative endophytes of coffee) was
detected using BLASTN against a version of the NT
database containing only bacteria (NT-bac) and
BLASTX against the NR database. The results against
NT-bac with E-values > 1e-40 and the percent of identical nucleotides > 80% were considered bacterial contamination. In addition, hits against NR with a percent of
identity > 30% and all of the hits against bacteria were
considered bacterial contamination. All of the BCGP
ESTs were submitted to GenBank with accession numbers GT640310-GT640366, GT669291-GT734396,
GW427076 - GW492625 (C. arabica) and GT645618GT658452 (C. canephora).
Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) analyses and GC
content

QualitySNP [24] was used to analyze polymorphisms present in C. arabica and C. canephora. QualitySNP uses
three quality filters for the identification of reliable SNPs.
The first filter screens for all potential SNPs. False SNPs
caused by sequencing errors are identified by the chromatogram quality given by Phred. The second filter is the core
filter, which uses a haplotype-based strategy to detect reliable SNPs. The clusters with potential paralogs are identified using the differences in SNP number between
potential haplotypes of the same contig. All potential haplotypes consisting of only one sequence are removed, and
singleton SNPs that are not linked to other polymorphisms
are not considered. This may lead to an underestimation of
nucleotide diversity but assures that false positives will be
discarded. The last filter screens SNPs by calculating a confidence score based on sequence redundancy and base
quality. To label each polymorphism as synonymous or
non-synonymous, the correct open reading frame (ORF) of
each sequence was identified by looking for similarity calculated with the FASTA algorithm against the Uniprot
databank http://www.uniprot.org using an E-value threshold of -05. The alignments were analyzed with QualitySNP
script GetnonsySNPfasty, which corrects frame shifts
and attempts to expand the 3’ end until the next stop
codon and the 5’ end until the next ATG codon. This
script identifies if the polymorphism changes the amino
acid, labeling each polymorphism as non-synonymous
(KA) or synonymous (KS). This information was used to
calculate KA/KS ratios for positive selection using kaks
calculator software [135]. All of the ORFs predicted in
QualitySNP were used to calculate the GC content of

Page 17 of 22

C. arabica and C. canephora. A total of 1,380 full length
sequences > 200 bp of Arabidopsis thaliana were extracted
from Genbank. Sequences of Solanum lycopersicum were
also randomly retrieved from the Kazusa http://www.kazusa.
or.jp/jsol/microtom/indexj.html and SGN databanks [23].
Total GC and GC3 were calculated for each sequence and
plotted in a histogram graph with 100 classes, which were
smoothed by using the average of each three sets of classes.
Automatic Functional Annotation, Metabolic Pathways
and Evaluation of Protein Domains

The complete set of ESTs from C. arabica and C. canephora were automatically annotated using the AutoFACT
program [31]. AutoFACT summarizes results of BLAST
similarity searches against nucleotide, protein and
domain databases in functional annotation. The databases used were Uniref100, Uniref90, NCBI-nr, KEGG
and CDD (E-value ≤ 1E-5). The annotation was submitted to the Pathologic module of the Pathway Tools
program (version 13.0) in order to generate metabolic
maps. Pathologic module looks at the product name and
E.C. number of annotations and imports the pathways
likely to be present from the reference database (MetaCyc). The C. arabica and C. canephora metabolic maps
were compared with PlantCyc, which contains curated
information about pathways present in > 250 plant species. The divergence among the maps was manually
annotated to eliminate false positives. To evaluate protein
domains, ESTs were submitted to similarity searches
against the CDD-PFAM database using RPS-BLAST (Evalue ≤ 1e -10 ). Data were normalized by dividing the
number of clusters from each CDD-PFAM by the total
number of hits from each species against CDD-PFAM.
Gene Ontology Analyses

Coffee datasets were annotated and mapped for the gene
ontologies “Biological Process” and “Molecular Function” (only level 3) by Blast2go [43]. Blast2go lists all
gene ontology terms found in biological processes and
molecular functions found in each dataset and associates
the amount of sequences with each term. These data
were normalized to the total number of sequences that
were labeled with a gene ontology term. Hypergeometric
distribution statistical analysis [44] was applied in the
datasets from fruit and leaf to find the sub- and overestimated GO terms in each species.
Orthologous Clustering (Ortho-MCL)

The Ortho-MCL algorithm [47] was applied to generate
orthologous groupings. Two different datasets were
used: i) the annotated proteins from the available complete genomes of A. thaliana (27,379 proteins), O. sativa
(56,797 proteins), Ricinus communis (31,221 proteins)
and Glycine max (66,210 proteins) and ii) the proteins

Mondego et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:30
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/30

predicted by FrameDP software [48] from the available
EST assemblies for C. arabica (28,585 predicted proteins), C. canephora (16,477 predicted proteins) and S.
lycopersicum (52,437 predicted proteins). All proteins
were compared (all against all) using BLASTP, and a
score for each pair of proteins (u, v) with significant
BLAST hits was assigned (E-value 1e-5; with at least 50%
of similarity). Based on these scores, the MCL algorithm
was applied to find clusters in this graph. The protocol
used is described at http://lge.ibi.unicamp.br/Ortho_MCL_UserGuide.txt.
Gene Expression Hierarchical Clustering Analysis

For in silico expression analysis, contig and singlet frequencies across the libraries were obtained from the dataset derived from the CAP3 assembly. The frequency of a
contig over a library represents its transcript abundance.
Only contigs containing more than two ESTs were used
for transcript profiling. Differentially expressed contigs
were identified using two statistical tests, R [55] and AC
[56], with the webtool IDEG6 [57]. In R statistics, a threshold p-value of 0.05 (95% confidence) was used with Bonferroni correction. AC statistics were calculated for
pairwise combinations of all libraries. Under this criterion,
a contig was considered of significant interest if the AC
statistics of at least one library against all of the other
libraries were lower than the threshold 0.05. The resulting
differentially expressed contigs were obtained with the
union of the two sets above. Each library frequency was
then normalized by the frequency of the contig.
In an attempt to cluster elements that are similar (in
some sense), hierarchical clustering [136] of the differentially expressed contigs was performed using MatlabR2009a (The Mathworks). Hierarchical algorithms
attempt to group the differentially expressed contigs based
on the expression profile of these contigs in the libraries.
The clustering of the rows (contigs) was performed, generating a heat map and a dendrogram. The libraries were
manually sorted according to tissue sources and stress
conditions, visually creating two libraries groups: “development” libraries and “stress” libraries.
