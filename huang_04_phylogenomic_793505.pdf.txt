Results: We have identified 31 genes of likely plastid/endosymbiont (n = 7) or prokaryotic (n =
24) origin using a phylogenomic approach. The findings support the hypothesis that Cryptosporidium
evolved from a plastid-containing lineage and subsequently lost its apicoplast during evolution.
Expression analyses of candidate genes of algal and eubacterial origin show that these genes are
expressed and developmentally regulated during the life cycle of C. parvum.

Cryptosporidium is a member of the Apicomplexa, a eukaryotic phylum that includes several important parasitic pathogens such as Plasmodium, Toxoplasma, Eimeria and

Theileria. As an emerging pathogen in humans and other animals, Cryptosporidium often causes fever, diarrhea, anorexia
and other complications. Although cryptosporidial infection
is often self-limiting, it can be persistent and fatal for

Conclusions: Cryptosporidium is the recipient of a large number of transferred genes, many of
which are not shared by other apicomplexan parasites. Genes transferred from distant
phylogenetic sources, such as eubacteria, may be potential targets for therapeutic drugs owing
to their phylogenetic distance or the lack of homologs in the host. The successful integration and
expression of the transferred genes in this genome has changed the genetic and metabolic
repertoire of the parasite.

Background: The apicomplexan parasite Cryptosporidium parvum is an emerging pathogen capable
of causing illness in humans and other animals and death in immunocompromised individuals. No
effective treatment is available and the genome sequence has recently been completed. This
parasite differs from other apicomplexans in its lack of a plastid organelle, the apicoplast. Gene
transfer, either intracellular from an endosymbiont/donor organelle or horizontal from another
organism, can provide evidence of a previous endosymbiotic relationship and/or alter the genetic
repertoire of the host organism. Given the importance of gene transfers in eukaryotic evolution
and the potential implications for chemotherapy, it is important to identify the complement of
transferred genes in Cryptosporidium.

immunocompromised individuals. So far, no effective treatment is available [1]. Furthermore, because of its resistance to
standard chlorine disinfection of water, Cryptosporidium
continues to be a security concern as a potential water-borne
bioterrorism agent [2].

Table 1

Cryptosporidium is phylogenetically quite distant from the
hemosporidian and coccidian apicomplexans [3] and,
depending on the molecule and method used, is either basal
to all Apicomplexa examined thus far, or is the sister group to
the gregarines [4,5]. It is unusual in several respects, notably
for the lack of the apicoplast organelle which is characteristic
of all other apicomplexans that have been examined [6,7].
The apicoplast is a relict plastid hypothesized to have been
acquired by an ancient secondary endosymbiosis of a prealveolate eukaryotic cell with an algal cell [8]. All that remains
of the endosymbiont in Coccidia and Haemosporidia is a plastid organelle surrounded by four membranes [9]. The apicoplast retains its own genome, but this is much reduced (27-35
kilobases (kb)), and contains genes primarily involved in the
replication of the plastid genome [10,11]. In apicomplexans
that have a plastid, many of the original plastid genes appear
to have been lost (for example, photosynthesis genes) and
some genes have been transferred to the host nuclear
genome; their proteins are reimported into the apicoplast
where they function [12]. Plastids acquired by secondary
endosymbiosis are scattered among eukaryotic lineages,
including cryptomonads, haptophytes, alveolates, euglenids
and chlorarachnions [13-17]. Among the alveolates, plastids
are found in dinoflagellates and most examined apicomplexans but not in ciliates. Recent studies on the nuclear-encoded,
plastid-targeted glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) gene suggest a common origin of the secondary
plastids in apicomplexans, some dinoflagellates, heterokonts,
haptophytes and cryptomonads [8,18]. If true, this would
indicate that the lineage that gave rise to Cryptosporidium
contained a plastid, even though many of its descendants (for
example, the ciliates) appear to lack a plastid. Although indirect evidence has been noted for the past existence of an apicoplast in C. parvum [19,20], no rigorous phylogenomic
survey for nuclear-encoded genes of plastid or algal origin has
been reported.
Gene transfers, either intracellular (IGT) from an endosymbiont or organelle to the host nucleus or horizontal (HGT)
between species, can dramatically alter the biochemical repertoire of host organisms and potentially create structural or
functional novelties [21-23]. In parasites, genes transferred
from prokaryotes or other sources are potential targets for
chemotherapy due to their phylogenetic distance or lack of a
homolog in the host [24,25]. The detection of transferred
genes in Cryptosporidium is thus of evolutionary and practical importance.
In this study, we use a phylogenomic approach to mine the
recently sequenced genome of C. parvum (IOWA isolate; 9.1

prokaryotic lineages in C. parvum. The fate of several of these
transferred genes in C. parvum is explored by expression
analyses. The significance of our findings and their impact on
the genetic makeup of the parasite are discussed.

Results
BLAST analyses
From BLAST analyses, the genome of Cryptosporidium, like
that of Plasmodium falciparum [26], is more similar overall
to those of the plants Arabidopsis and Oryza than to any
other non-apicomplexan organism currently represented in
GenBank. The program Glimmer predicted 5,519 proteincoding sequences in the C. parvum genome, 4,320 of which
had similarity to other sequences deposited in the GenBank
nonredundant protein database. A significant number of
these sequences, 936 (E-value < 10-3) or 783 (E-value < 10-7),
had their most significant, non-apicomplexan, similarity to a
sequence isolated from plants, algae, eubacteria (including
cyanobacteria) or archaea (Table 1). To evaluate these observations further, phylogenetic analyses were performed, when
possible, for each predicted protein in the entire genome.

Phylogenomic analyses
The Glimmer-predicted protein-coding regions of the C. parvum genome (5,519 sequences) were used as input for phylogenetic analyses using the PyPhy program [27]. In this
program, phylogenetic trees for each input sequence are analyzed to determine the taxonomic identity of the nearest
neighbor relative to the input sequence at a variety of taxonomic levels, for example, genus, family, or phylum. Using
stringent analysis criteria (see Materials and methods), 954
trees were constructed from the input set of 5,519 predicted
protein sequences (Figure 1). Analysis of the nearest non-apicomplexan neighbor on the 954 trees revealed the following
nearest neighbor relationships: eubacterial (115 trees),

Searches of the C. parvum predicted gene set with the 551 P.
falciparum predicted nuclear-encoded apicoplast-targeted
proteins (NEAPs) yielded 40 significant hits (E-value < 10-5),
23 of which were also identified in the phylogenomic analyses. A combination of these two approaches identified 410
candidates requiring further detailed analyses. Of these candidates, the majority were eliminated after stringent criteria
were applied because of ambiguous tree topologies, insufficient taxonomic sampling, lack of bootstrap support or the
presence of clear vertical eukaryotic ancestry (see Materials
and methods). Thirty-one genes survived the screen and were
deemed to be either strong or likely candidates for gene transfer (Table 2).
Of the 31 recovered genes, several have been previously published or submitted to the GenBank [20], including those
identified as having plant or eubacterial 'likeness' on the basis
of similarity searches when the genome sequence was published [7]. The remaining sequences were further tested to
rule out the possibility that they were artifacts (C. parvum
oocysts are purified from cow feces which contain plant and
bacterial matter). Two experiments were performed. In the
first, nearly complete genomic sequences (generated in a dif-

ferent laboratory) from the closely related species C. hominis
were screened using BLASTN for the existence of the predicted genes. Twenty out of 21 C. parvum sequences were
identified in C. hominis. The remaining sequence was represented by two independently isolated expressed sequence tag
(EST) sequences in the GenBank and CryptoDB databases
(data not shown). In the second experiment, genomic Southern analyses of the IOWA isolate were carried out (Figure 2)
for several of the genes of bacterial or plant origin. In each
case, a band of the predicted size was identified (see Additional data file 1). The genes are not contaminants.

Genes of cyanobacterial/algal origin
Extant Cryptosporidium species do not contain an apicoplast
genome or any physical structure thought to represent an
algal endosymbiont or the plastid organelle it contained [6,7].
The only possible remaining evidence of the past association
of an endosymbiont or its cyanobacterially derived plastid
organelle might be genes transferred from these genetic
sources to the host genome prior to the physical loss of the
endosymbiont or organelle itself. Several such genes were
identified.
A leucine aminopeptidase gene of cyanobacterial origin was
found in the C. parvum nuclear genome. This gene is also

interactions

Only one gene of algal nuclear origin, glucose-6-phosphate
isomerase (G6PI), was identified by the screen described
here. Several other algal-like genes are probable, but their
support was weaker (Table 2). A 'plant-like' G6PI has been
described in other apicomplexan species (P. falciparum, T.
gondii [29]) and a 'cyanobacterial-like' G6PI has been
described in the diplomonads Giardia intestinalis and Spironucleus and the parabasalid Trichomonas vaginalis [30].
Figure 4b illustrates these observations nicely. At the base of
the tree, the eukaryotic organisms Giardia, Spironucleus and
Trichomonas group with the cyanobacterium Nostoc, as previously published. In the midsection of the tree, the G6PI of
apicomplexans and ciliates forms a well-supported monophyletic group with the plants and the heterokont Phytophthora. The multiple protein sequence alignment of G6PI
identifies several conserved positions shared exclusively by
apicomplexans, Tetrahymena, plants and Phytophthora.
This gene does not contain a signal or transit peptide and is
not predicted to be targeted to the apicoplast in P. falciparum. The remainder of the tree shows a weakly supported
branch including eubacteria, fungi and several eukaryotes.
The eukaryotes are interrupted by the inclusion of G6PI from
the eubacterial organisms Escherichia coli and Cytophaga.
This relationship of E. coli G6PI and eukaryotic G6PI has
been observed before and may represent yet another gene
transfer [31].

refereed research

Another C. parvum nuclear-encoded gene of putative cyanobacterial origin is a protein of unknown function belonging to
the biopterine transporter family (BT-1) (Table 2). Similarity
searches with this protein revealed significant hits to other
apicomplexans (for example, P. falciparum, Theileria annulata, T. gondii), plants (Arabidopsis, Oryza), cyanobacteria
(Trichodesmium, Nostoc and Synechocystis), a ciliate (Tetrahymena) and the kinetoplastids (Leishmania and
Trypanosoma). Arabidopsis thaliana apparently contains at
least two copies of this gene; the protein of one (accession
number NP_565734) is predicted by ChloroP [28] to be chloroplast-targeted, suggestive of its plastid derivation. The taxo-

nomic distribution and sequence similarity of this protein
with cyanobacterial and chloroplast homologs are also indicative of its affinity to plastids.

present in the nuclear genome of other apicomplexan species
(Plasmodium, Toxoplasma and Eimeria), as confirmed by
similarity searches against ApiDB (see Materials and methods). In P. falciparum, leucine aminopeptidase is a predicted
NEAP and possesses an amino-terminal extension with a
putative transit peptide. Consistent with the lack of an apicoplast, this gene in Cryptosporidium contains no evidence of a
signal peptide and the amino-terminal extension is reduced.
Similarity searches of the GenBank nonredundant protein
database revealed top hits to Plasmodium, followed by Arabidopsis thaliana, and several cyanobacteria including
Prochlorococcus, Nostoc and Trichodesmium, and plant
chloroplast precursors in Lycopersicon esculentum and Solanum tuberosum (data not shown). A multiple sequence alignment of the predicted protein sequences of leucine
aminopeptidase reveals overall similarity and a shared indel
among apicomplexan, plant and cyanobacterial sequences
(Figure 3). Phylogenetic analyses strongly support a
monophyletic grouping of C. parvum and other apicomplexan leucine aminopeptidase proteins with cyanobacteria
and plant chloroplast precursors (Figure 4a). So far, this gene
has not been detected in ciliates.

pathway contains at least two previously published, independently transferred genes from eubacteria. Inosine 5'
monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), an enzyme for
purine salvage, was transferred from ε-proteobacteria [32].
Another enzyme involved in pyrimidine salvage, thymidine
kinase (TK), is of α or γ-proteobacterial ancestry [25].
Another gene of eubacterial origin identified in C. parvum is
tryptophan synthetase β subunit (trpB). This gene has been
identified in both C. parvum and C. hominis, but not in other
apicomplexans. The relationship of C. parvum trpB to proteobacterial sequences is well-supported as a monophyletic
group by two of the three methods used in our analyses (Figure 4c).
Other HGTs of eubacterial origin include the genes encoding
α-amylase and glutamine synthetase and two copies of 1,4-αglucan branching enzyme, all of which are overwhelmingly
similar to eubacterial sequences. α-amylase shows no significant hit to any other apicomplexan or eukaryotic sequence,
suggesting a unique HGT from eubacteria to C. parvum.

Glutamine synthetase is a eubacterial gene found in C. parvum and all apicomplexans examined. The eubacterial affinity of the apicomplexan glutamine synthetase is also
demonstrated by a well supported (80% with maximum parsimony) monophyletic grouping with eubacterial homologs
(data not shown). The eubacterial origin of 1,4-α-glucan
branching enzyme is shown in Figure 5. Each copy of the gene
is found in a strongly supported monophyletic group of
sequences derived only from prokaryotes (including cyanobacteria) and one other apicomplexan organism, T. gondii. It is
possible that these genes are of plastidic origin and were
transferred to the nuclear genome before the divergence of C.
parvum and T. gondii; the phylogenetic analysis provides little direct support for this interpretation, however.

Mode of acquisition
We examined the transferred genes for evidence of non-independent acquisition, for example, blocks of transferred genes
or evidence that genes were acquired together from the same
source. Examination of the chromosomal location of the
genes listed in Table 2 demonstrates that the genes are cur-

Phylogenetic analyses of 1,4-α-glucan branching enzyme

rently located on different chromosomes and in most cases do
not appear to have been transferred or retained in large
blocks. There are two exceptions. The trpB gene and the gene
for aspartate ammonia ligase are located 4,881 base-pairs
(bp) apart on the same strand of a contig for chromosome V;
there is no annotated gene between these two genes. Both
genes are of eubacterial origin and are not found in other apicomplexan organisms. While it is possible that they have been
acquired independently with this positioning, or later came to
have this positioning via genome rearrangements, it is interesting to speculate that these genes were acquired together.
The origin of trpB is proteobacterial. The origin of aspartate
ammonia ligase is eubacterial, but not definitively of any particular lineage. In the absence of genome sequences for all
organisms, throughout all of time, exact donors are extremely
difficult to assess and inferences must be drawn from
sequences that appear to be closely related to the actual
donor.
In the second case, C. parvum encodes two genes for 1,4-αglucan branching enzymes. Both are eubacterial in origin and
both are located on chromosome VI, although not close
together. They are approximately 110 kb apart and many
intervening genes are present. The evidence that these
genes were acquired together comes from the phylogenetic
analysis presented in Figure 5. The duplication that gave rise
to the two 1,4-α-glucan branching enzymes is old, and is well
supported by the tree shown in Figure 5. A number of eubacteria (11), including cyanobacteria, contain this duplication.
The 1,4-α-glucan branching enzymes of C. parvum and T.
gondii represent one copy each of this ancient duplication.
This suggests that the ancestor of C. parvum and T. gondii
acquired the genes after they had duplicated and diverged in
eubacteria.

Expression of transferred genes
Each of the genes identified in the above analyses (Table 2)
appears to be an intact non-pseudogene, suggesting that
these genes are functional. To verify the functional status of
several of the transferred genes, semi-quantitative reverse
transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was carried out to characterize
their developmental expression profile. Each of the RNA samples from C. parvum-infected HCT-8 cells was shown to be
free of contaminating C. parvum genomic DNA by the lack of
amplification product from a reverse transcriptase reaction
sham control. RT-PCR detected no signals in cDNA samples
from mock-infected HCT-8 cells. On the other hand, RT-PCR
product signals were detected in the C. parvum-infected cells
of six independent time-course experiments for each of the
genes examined (those for G6PI, leucine aminopeptidase,

BT-1, a calcium-dependent protein kinase, tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, dihydrofolate reductase- thymidine synthetase
(DHFR-TS)). The expression profiles of the acquired genes
show that they are regulated and differentially expressed
throughout the life cycle of C. parvum in patterns characteristic of other non-transferred genes (Figure 6).
A small published collection of 567 EST sequences for C. parvum is also available. These ESTs were searched with each of
the 31 candidate genes surviving the phylogenomic screen.
Three genes - aspartate ammonia ligase, BT-1 and lactate
dehydrogenase - are expressed, as confirmed by the presence
of an EST (Table 2).

Discussion

A genome-wide search for intracellular and horizontal gene
transfers in C. parvum was carried out. We systematically
determined the evolutionary origins of genes in the genome
using phylogenetic approaches, and further confirmed the
existence and expression of putatively transferred genes with
laboratory experiments. The methodology adopted in this
study provides a broad picture of the extent and the importance of gene transfer in apicomplexan evolution.
The identification of gene transfers is often subject to errors
introduced by methodology, data quality and taxonomic sampling. The phylogenetic approach adopted in this study is
preferable to similarity searches [33,34] but several factors,
including long-branch attraction, mutational saturation, lineage-specific gene loss and acquisition, and incorrect identification of orthologs, can distort the topology of a gene tree
[35,36]. Incompleteness in the taxonomic record may also
lead to false positives for IGT and HGT identification. In our
study, we have attempted to alleviate these factors, as best as
is possible, by sampling the GenBank nonredundant protein
database, dbEST and organism-specific databases and by
using several phylogenetic methods. Still, these issues remain
a concern for this study as the taxonomic diversity of
unicellular eukaryotes is vastly undersampled and studies are
almost entirely skewed towards parasitic organisms.
The published analysis of the C. parvum genome sequence
identified 14 bacteria-like and 15 plant-like genes based on
similarity searches [7]. Six of these bacterial-like and three
plant-like genes were also identified as probable transferred
genes in the phylogenomic analyses presented here. We have
examined the fate of genes identified by one analysis and not
the other to uncover the origin of the discrepancy. First,
methodology is the single largest contributing factor. Genes

with bacterial-like or plant-like BLAST similarities which,
from the phylogenetic analyses, do not appear to be transfers
were caused by the fact that PyPhy was unable to generate
trees due to an insufficient number of significant hits in the
database, or because of the stringent coverage length and
similarity requirements adopted in this analysis. Only seven
of the previously identified 15 plant-like and 11 of 14
eubacterial-like genes survived the predefined criteria for tree
construction. Second, subsequent phylogenetic analyses
including additional sequences from non-GenBank databases
failed to provide sufficient evidence or significant support for
either plant or eubacterial ancestry. Third, searches of dbEST
and other organism-specific databases yielded other nonplant or non-eubacterial organisms as nearest neighbors,
thus removing the possibility of a transfer.
The limitations of similarity searches and incomplete taxonomic sampling are well evidenced in our phylogenomic analyses. From similarity searches, C. parvum, like P. falciparum
[26], is more similar to the plants Arabidopsis and Oryza
than to any other single organism. Almost 800 predicted
genes have best non-apicomplexan BLAST hits of at least 10-7
to plants and eubacteria (Table 1). Yet only 31 can be inferred
to be transferred genes at this time with the datasets and
methodology available (Table 2). In many cases (for example,
phosphoglucomutase) the C. parvum gene groups phylogenetically with plant and bacterial homologs, but with only
modest support. In other cases, such as pyruvate kinase and
the bi-functional dehydrogenase enzyme (AdhE), gene trees
obtained from automated PyPhy analyses indicate a strong
monophyletic grouping of the C. parvum gene with plant or
eubacterial homologs, but this topology disappears when
sequences from other unicellular eukaryotes, such as Dictyostelium, Entamoeba and Trichomonas are included in the
analysis (data not shown).
The list of genes in Table 2 should be considered a current
best estimate of the IGTs and HGTs in C. parvum instead of a
definitive list. As genomic data are obtained from a greater
diversity of unicellular eukaryotes and eubacteria, phylogenetic analyses of nearest neighbors are likely to change.

Did Cryptosporidium contain an endosymbiont or
plastid organelle?
The C. parvum sequences of cyanobacterial and algal origin
reported here had to enter the genome at some point during
its evolution. Formal possibilities include vertical inheritance
from a plastid-containing chromalveolate ancestor, HGT
from the cyanobacterial and algal sources (or from a secondary source such as a plastid-containing apicomplexan), or
IGT from an endosymbiont/plastid organelle during evolution, followed by loss of the source. Cryptosporidium does
not harbor an apicoplast organelle or any trace of a plastid
genome [7]; thus an IGT scenario would necessitate loss of
the organelle in Cryptosporidium or the lineage giving rise to
it. The exact position of C. parvum on the tree of life has been

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/11/R88

debated, with developmental and morphological considerations placing it within the Apicomplexa, and molecular analyses locating it in various positions, both within and outside
the Apicomplexa [3], but primarily within. If we assume that
C. parvum is an apicomplexan, and if the secondary endosymbiosis which is believed to have given rise to the apicoplast occurred before the formation of the Apicomplexa, as
has been suggested [18], C. parvum would have evolved from
a plastid-containing lineage and would be expected to harbor
traces of this relationship in its nuclear genome. Genes of
likely cyanobacterial and algal/plant origin are detected in
the nuclear genome of C. parvum (Table 2) and thus IGT followed by organelle loss cannot be ruled out.
What about other interpretations? While it is formally possible that these genes were acquired independently via HGT in
C. parvum, their shared presence in other alveolates (including the non-plastidic ciliate Tetrahymena) provides the best
evidence against this scenario as multiple independent transfers would be required and so far there is no evidence for
intra-alveolate gene transfer. Vertical inheritance is more difficult to address as it involves distinguishing between genes
acquired via IGT from a primary endosymbiotic event versus
a secondary endosymbioic event. Our data, especially the
analysis of G6PI and BT-1 are consistent with both primary
and secondary endosymbioses, provided that the secondary
endosymbiosis is pre-alveolate in origin. As more genome
data become available and flanking genes can be examined
for each gene in a larger context, positional information will
be informative in distinguishing among the alternatives.
The plastidic nature of some genes is particularly apparent.
There is a shared indel among leucine aminopeptidase protein sequences in apicomplexans, cyanobacteria and plant
chloroplast precursors (Figure 3). The C. parvum leucine
aminopeptidase does contain an amino-terminal extension of
approximately 85-65 amino acids (depending on the alignment) relative to bacterial homologs, but this extension does
not contain a signal sequence. The extension in P. falciparum
is 85 amino acids and the protein is believed to be targeted to
the apicoplast [26,37]. No similarity is detected between the
C. parvum and P. falciparum amino-terminal extensions
(data not shown).
Other genes were less informative in this analysis. Among
these, aldolase was reported in both P. falciparum [38] and
the kinetoplastid parasite Trypanosoma [38] as a plant-like
gene. The protein sequences of aldolase are similar in C. parvum and P. falciparum, with an identity of 60%. In our phylogenetic analyses, C. parvum clearly forms a monophyletic
group with Plasmodium, Toxoplasma and Eimeria. This
branch groups with Dictyostelium, Kinetoplastida and cyanobacterial lineages, but bootstrap support is not significant.
The sister group to the above organisms are the plants and
additional cyanobacteria, but again with no bootstrap support (see Additional data file 1 for phylogenetic tree). Another

has been shown to be functional in pyrimidine salvage [25]. It
is not yet clear whether these genes were acquired
independently in this lineage, or have been lost from the rest
of the apicomplexan lineage, or whether both these have happened. However, it is clear that their presence has facilitated
the remodeling of nucleotide biosynthesis. C. parvum no
longer possesses the ability to synthesize nucleotides; instead
it relies entirely on salvage.

information

Once thought to be a relatively rare event, reports of gene
transfers in eukaryotes are increasingly common. The abundance of available eukaryotic genome sequence is providing
the material for analyses that were not possible only a few

interactions

Cryptosporidium is the recipient of a large number (31) of
transferred genes, many of which are not shared by other apicomplexan parasites. The genes have been acquired from several different sources including α-, β-, and ε-proteobacteria,
cyanobacteria, algae/plants and possibly the Archaea. We
have described two cases of two genes that appear to have
been acquired together from a eubacterial source: trpB and
the aspartate ammonia ligase gene are located within 5 kb of
each other, while the two copies of 1,4-α-glucan branching
enzyme represent copies of an ancient gene duplication also
observed in cyanobacteria.

The impact of gene transfers on host evolution
Gene transfer is an important evolutionary force
[21,22,45,46]. Several of the transferred genes identified in C.
parvum are known to be expressed. IMPDH has been shown
to be essential in C. parvum purine metabolism [32] and TK

deposited research

The endosymbiotic event that gave rise to the mitochondrion
occurred very early in eukaryotic evolution and is associated
with significant IGT. However, most of these transfer events
happened long before the evolutionary time window we
explored in this study [41]. Many IGTs from the mitochondrial genome that have been retained are almost universally
present in eukaryotes (including C. parvum which does not
contain a typical mitochondrion [7,42-44]) and thus would
not be detected in a PyPhy screen since the 'nearest phylogenetic neighbor' on the tree would be taxonomically correct
and not appear as a relationship indicative of a gene transfer.

Many apicoplast and algal nuclear genes have been transferred to the host nuclear genome, where they were subsequently translated in the cytosol and their proteins targeted to
the apicoplast organelle. However, as there is no apicoplast in
C. parvum, acquired plastidic proteins are theoretically destined to go elsewhere. In the absence of an apicoplast, it is
tempting to suspect that plastid-targeted proteins would have
been lost, or would be detected as pseudogenes. No identifiable pseudogenes were detected and at least one gene is still
viable. The C. parvum leucine aminopeptidase, which still
contains an amino-terminal extension (without a signal peptide), is intact and is expressed, as shown in Figure 6. None of
the cyanobacterial/algal genes identified in our study
contains a canonical presequence for apicoplast targeting.
One exception to this is phosphoglucomutase, a gene not
present in Table 2 because of its poorly supported relationships in phylogenetic analyses. This gene exists in two copies
as a tandem duplication in the C. parvum genome. One copy
has a long amino-terminal extension (97 amino acids) beginning with a signal peptide. The extension does not contain
characteristics of a transit peptide. Expression of a fluorescent reporter construct containing this extension in a related
parasite, T. gondii, did not reveal apicoplast targeting but
instead secretion via dense granules (see Additional data file
1). Exactly how and where intracellularly transferred genes
(especially those that normally target the apicoplast) have
become incorporated into other metabolic processes remains
a fertile area for exploration.

reports

Several HGTs from bacteria have been reported previously in
C. parvum [25,32,40]. We detected many more in our screen
of the completed C. parvum genome sequence (Table 2). In
most cases, the exact donors of these transferred genes were
difficult to determine. However, for those genes whose
donors could be more reliably inferred (Table 2), several
appear to be from different sources and hence represent independent transfer events. In one compelling case, both the
trpB and aspartate ammonia ligase genes are located 4,881 bp
apart on the same strand of a contig for chromosome V and
there is no gene separating them. Both genes are of eubacterial origin and neither gene is detected in other apicomplexans. In addition, the aspartate ammonia ligase gene is
expressed, as evidenced by an EST. In another case, copies of
a 1,4-α-glucan branching enzyme gene duplication pair that is
present in many eubacteria, were detected on the same chromosome in C. parvum. C. parvum also contains many transferred genes from distinct eubacterial sources that are not
present in other apicomplexans (for example, IMPDH, TK
(thymidine kinase), trpB and the gene for aspartate ammonia
ligase).

The biochemical activity of the polyamine biosynthetic
enzyme arginine decarboxylase (ADC), which is typically
found in plants and bacteria, was previously reported in C.
parvum [19]. However, we were unable to confirm its
presence by similarity searches of the two Cryptosporidium
genome sequences deposited in CryptoDB using plant (Cucumis sativa, GenBank accession number AAP36992), cyanobacterial (Nostoc sp., NP-487441; Synechocystis sp., NP439907) and other bacterial (Yersinia pestis, NP-404547)

years ago. Analysis of the Arabidopsis genome [47] has
revealed potentially thousands of genes that were transferred
intracellularly. HGTs are still a relatively rare class of genes
among multicellular eukaryotes, most probably because of
the segregation of the germ line. By definition, unicellular
eukaryotes do not have a separate germ line and are obligated
to tolerate the acquisition of foreign genes if they are to survive. Among unicellular eukaryotes, there are now many
reports of HGTs: Giardia [48,49], Trypanosoma [38], Entamoeba [21,49], Euglena [50], Cryptosporidium [25,32,40]
and other apicomplexans [51].
As discussed earlier, genes transferred from distant phylogenetic sources such as eubacteria could be potential therapeutic targets. In apicomplexans, transferred genes are already
some of the most promising targets of anti-parasitic drugs
and vaccines [7,25,52]. We have shown that several transferred genes are differentially expressed in the C. parvum
genome, and in two cases (IMPDH and TK), the transferred
genes have been shown to be functional [25,32]. The
successful integration, expression and survival of transferred
genes in the Cryptosporidium genome has changed the
genetic and metabolic repertoire of the parasite.

Materials and methods
Cryptosporidium sequence sources
Genomic sequences for C. parvum and C. hominis were
downloaded from CryptoDB [53]. Genes were predicted for
the completed C. parvum (IOWA) sequence as previously
described using the Glimmer program [54] trained on Cryptosporidium coding sequences [52]. A few predicted genes
that demonstrated apparent sequence incompleteness were
reconstructed from genomic sequence by comparison with
apicomplexan orthologs. The predicted protein encoding data
set contained 5,519 sequences. A comparison of this gene set
to the published annotation revealed that the Glimmer-predicted gene set contained all but 40 of the 3,396 annotated
protein-encoding sequences deposited in GenBank. These 40
were added to our dataset and analyzed. Glimmer does not
predict introns and some introns are present in the genome
[7,20]; thus our gene count is artificially inflated. Likewise,
the official C. parvum annotation did not consider ORFs of
less than 100 amino acids that did not have significant BLAST
hits and thus may be a slight underestimate [7].

Database creation
An internal database (ApiDB) containing all available apicomplexan sequence data was created [25]. A second BLASTsearchable database, PyPhynr, was constructed that included
SwissProt, TrEMBL and TrEMBL_new, as released in August
2003, predicted genes from C. parvum, ORFs of more than
120 amino acids from Theileria annulata, and more than 75
amino acids from consensus ESTs for several apicomplexan
organisms. Genomic sequences for T. gondii (8x coverage)
and clustered ESTs were downloaded from ToxoDB [55,56].

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/11/R88

Genomic data were provided by The Institute for Genomic
Research (TIGR), and by the Sanger Institute. EST sequences
were generated by Washington University. In addition, this
study used sequence data from several general and speciesspecific databases. Specifically, the NCBI GenBank nr and
dbEST were downloaded [57] and extensively searched. To
provide taxonomic completeness, additional genes were
obtained via searches of additional databases including:
Entamoeba histolytica [58], D. discoideum [59], the kinetoplastids Leishmania major [59], T. brucei [59], T. cruzi [60],
and a ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila [61]. Sequence data
for T. annulata, E. histolytica, D. discoideum, L. major and T.
brucei were produced by the Pathogen Sequencing Unit of the
Sanger Institute and can be obtained from [62]. Preliminary
sequence data for T. thermophila was obtained from TIGR
and can be accessed at [63].

Phylogenomic analyses and similarity searches
The source code of the phylogenomic software PyPhy [27] was
kindly provided by Thomas Sicheritz-Ponten and modified to
include analyses of eukaryotic groups, and changes to
improve functionality [51]. For initial phylogenomic analyses,
a BLAST cutoff of 60% sequence length coverage and 50%
sequence similarity was adopted and the neighbor-joining
program of PAUP 4.0b10 for Unix [64] was used. A detailed
description of our phylogenomic pipeline and PyPhy implementation are described [51] and outlined in Figure 1.
Output gene trees with phylogenetic connections (that is, the
nearest non-self neighbors at a distinct taxonomic rank) [27]
to prokaryotes and algae-related groups were manually
inspected. As the trees are unrooted, several factors were considered in the screen for candidate transferred genes. If the C.
parvum gene does not form a monophyletic group with
prokaryotic or plant-related taxa regardless of rooting, the
subject gene was eliminated from further consideration. If the
topology of the gene tree is consistent with a phylogenetic
anomaly caused by gene transfer, but may also be interpreted
differently if the tree is rooted otherwise, it was removed from
consideration at this time. If the top hits of both nr and dbEST
database searches are predominantly non-plant eukaryotes,
and the topology of the tree was poor, the subject gene was
considered an unlikely candidate. Finally, all 551 protein
sequences predicted to be NEAPs in the malarial parasite P.
falciparum [26] were used to search the C. parvum genome
and the results were screened using a BLAST cutoff E-value of
10-5 and a length coverage of 50%. Sequences identified by
these searches were added to the candidate list (if not already
present) for manual phylogenetic analyses to verify their
likely origins. It should be noted that all trees were screened
for the existence of a particular phylogenetic relationship. In
some cases the proteins utilized to generate a particular tree
are capable of resolving relationships among many branches
of the tree of life, and in others they are not. Despite these differences in resolving power, the proteins which survive our
phylogenetic screen and subsequent detailed analyses

C. parvum (IOWA) oocysts (108) were obtained from the
Sterling Parasitology Laboratory at the University of Arizona
and were lysed using a freeze/thaw method. Genomic DNA
was purified using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen). Genomic
DNA (5 µg) was restricted with BamH1 and EcoR1 respectively and electrophoresed on a 0.8% gel in 1x TAE buffer,
transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (BioRad), and fixed using a UVP crosslinker set at 125 mJ as
described in [71]. C. parvum genomic DNA for the probes
(700-1,500 bp) was amplified by PCR (see Additional data file
1).

Primers specific for several transferred genes identified in the
study were designed (see Additional data file 1) and a semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis was carried out as previously
described [72]. Primers specific for C. parvum 18S rRNA
were used to normalize the amount of cDNA product of the
candidate gene to that of C. parvum rRNA in the same sample. PCR products were separated on a 4% non-denaturing
polyacrylamide gel and signals from specific products were
captured and quantified using a phosphorimaging system
(Molecular Dynamics). The expression level of each gene at
each time point was calculated as the ratio of its RT-PCR
product signal to that of the C. parvum 18S rRNA. Six independent time-course experiments were used in the analysis.

Detailed phylogenetic analyses of candidate genes identified
by phylogenomic screening: candidate genes surviving the
PyPhy phylogenomic screen were reanalyzed with careful
attention to taxonomic completeness, including representative species from major prokaryotic and eukaryotic lineages
when necessary and possible. New multiple sequence alignments were created with ClustalX [66], followed by manual
refinement. Only unambiguously aligned sequence segments
were used for subsequent analyses (see Additional data file 1).
Phylogenetic analyses were performed with a maximum
likelihood method using TREE-PUZZLE version 5.1 for Unix
[67], a distance method using the program neighbor of
PHYLIP version 3.6a package [68], and a maximum
parsimony method with random stepwise addition using
PAUP* 4.0b10 [64]. Bootstrap support was estimated using
1,000 replicates for both parsimony and distance analyses
and quartet puzzling values were obtained using 10,000 puzzling steps for maximum likelihood analyses. Distance calculation used the Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) substitution
matrix [69], and site-substitution variation was modeled with
a gamma-distribution whose shape parameter was estimated
from the data. For maximum likelihood analyses, a mixed
model of eight gamma-distributed rates and one invariable
rate was used to calculate the pairwise maximum likelihood
distances. The unrooted trees presented in Figures 4 and 5
were drawn by supplying TREE-PUZZLE with the maximum
parsimony tree and using TREE-PUZZLE distances as
described above to calculate the branch lengths. The trees
were visualized and prepared for publication with TreeView X
Version 0.4.1 [70].
