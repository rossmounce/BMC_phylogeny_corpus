Abstract
Background: Kocuria, established by Stackebrandt et al., previously was classified into Micrococcus. Only two species, K.
rosea and K. kristinae are reported to be associated as pathogenic and found with catheter-related bacteremia and
acute cholecystitis.
Case presentation: We herein report the first case of brain abscess caused by Kocuria varians, a gram-positive
microorganism, in a 52-year-old man. Hematogenous spread is the probable pathogenesis.
Conclusions: This report presents a case of Kocuria varians brain abscess successfully treated with surgical excision
combined with antimicrobial therapy. In addition, Vitek 2 system has been used to identify and differentiate between
coagulase-negative staphylococcus.
Background
Kocuria spp. are gram-positive, strictly aerobic microorganisms. Previously they were classified into genus
Micrococcus, but have now been removed from Micrococcus based on phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic analysis
[1]. This bacterial cluster consists of nine species and is
generally considered to be non-pathogenic commensals
that colonize the skin, mucosa and oropharynx. However,
they can be opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised patients, though documented cases of infections
are rare. We describe a case which presented as a brain
abscess caused by Kocuria varians. To our knowledge,
this is the first reported case of Kocuria varians associated with brain abscess in the English literature.
Case presentation
A 52-year-old male, who had a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension without regular medication control,
presented without fever, but with headache and dizziness
for 2 months. These headaches were located over the
right occipital area without radiation. The headache
worsened while thinking or looking at objects for a long
time. Also, he did not have any cutaneous/mucosal
lesions prior to or during the period in which these head* Correspondence: teishin8@hotmail.com

aches occurred and he had not received any injections or
acupuncture. On hospital admission, he still did not have
any fever and physical examination revealed normal findings, but a neurological examination showed left side
homonymous hemianopia. Brain computerized tomography (CT) (Fig. 1A) and magnetic resonance (MR) (Fig.
1B) showed a right occipital brain abscess. Systemic
third-generation cephalosporins (Ceftazidime) and Metronidaole were initially administered pre-operatively for
one day by IV. Then, crainotomy and surgical extirpation
were performed promptly after a completed image study
identified the abscess. The capsule of the abscess was
completely removed during the operation. Pus culture
yielded a gram-positive microorganism identified as
Kocuria Varians by the Vitek 2 system. Post-operatively,
Metronidazole was ceased due to the outcome of an antibiotic susceptibility test report, for 4 weeks Ceftazidime
was administered and then shifted to oral form third-generation cephalosporins (Ceftibuten) for 2 weeks. Neurological function was successfully recovered after
operation
Microbiological diagnosis

Culture of brain abscess was performed with sheep blood
agar, eosin methylene blue agar and chocolate agar. The
plates were incubated at 35 degrees for 48 hours. Anaerobic culture was performed on Bacteroides Bile Esculin
agar and incubated at 35 degrees for 48 hours. Gram-pos-

identified as Kocuria varians with very good validity (Fig

Discussion
The incidence of brain abscess varies between 1500 to
2500 cases/year in the US, with higher incidences in
developing countries [2]. It occurs with the following predisposing sources: 1) contiguous spread; 2) hematogenous spread; 3) head trauma; and 4) neurosurgical
procedure. According to the previous literature, the most
common modes of direct contiguous spread were from
the middle ear, mastoid infections and paranasal sinus
[3]. But nowadays, hematogenous spread has become the
most common source [2]. The organisms that cause brain
abscess are typically bacterial in origin. Streptococcus and
staphylococcus are the most frequent organisms and can

be isolated from abscesses of all types and at all sites,
whereas Enterobacteriaceae and Bacteroides spp. are isolated from otogenic temporal lobe abscess [4]. In neonates, Proteus and Citrobacter spp. are the most common
organisms. Occasionally Mycobacterium tuberculosis as
well as fungal infections can act as organisms. Listeria
monocytogenes and Burkholderia pseudomallei are rarely
reported [4]. Micrococcus spp. associated with brain
abscess is mentioned in only two case reports in the English literature [5,8]. In reviewing the English literatures,
Kocuria varians related to brain abscess has not yet been
documented. Our case is the first reported case in which
brain abscess is caused by Kocuria varians.
Kocuria spp. are gram-positive, aerobic microorganisms and found as normal skin flora in humans and other
mammals. Infections related to Kocuria spp. are uncommon but can be opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised patients with underlying diseases. Kocuria spp.
was previous classified as Micrococcus spp. Recently,
Stackebrant and colleagues made a taxonomic revision of
Micrococcus spp. and reclassified it in the new genus
Kocuria spp. (Kocuria rosea; K. kristinae; K. varians; K.
palustris; and K. rhizophila ap. Nov.) [2,6]. The organism
Micrococcus luteus has been reported as a pathogen in
meningitis [7], intracranial abscess [8], arthritis [9], pneumonia [10] catheter-related sepsis in patients with hemo-

dialysis [11], or leukemia treatment [12]. K. rosea and K.
kristinae have been reported as pathogens causing catheter-related bacteremia and acute cholecystitis [13-15].
Due to the normal flora of skin or oropharynx and the
reported catheter-related bacteremia of other species, the
possible predisposing source of Kocuria varians is by
hematogenous spread to brain parenchyma.
Due to phenotypic variability, misidentification of
coagulase-negative staphylococcus as Kocuria by using
standard biochemical analysis is common [16]. Therefore
the Vitek 2 system has been used, which is scored as
being "very good identification" and is reportedly used in
both morphotypes [17]. Also the utilization of genotypic
assay, such as 16s RNA is used to confirm species identity
[15].
Most strains of Kocuria and Micrococcus were reported
to be sensitive to doxycycline, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime,
amikacin, and amoxicillin and erythromycin [18], but in
consideration of BBB and penetration of the abscess capsule, third-generation cephalosporins should be used. In
our case, surgical excision was performed and then thirdgeneration cephalosporins were administered intravenously for 4 weeks and then shifted to oral form thirdgeneration cephalosporins for 2 weeks as an adequate
therapy.

Conclusion
Herein we report the first case of Kocuria varians associated with brain abscess in the reviewing the English literature. Because Kocuria spp. is found as normal flora and
the hematogenous spread of other related species in
reported cases, we supposed Kucuria varians caused
brain abscess by hematogenous spreading. Besides Vitek
2 system, 16s RNA may be additionally used to confirm
and thus avoid misidentification as coagulase-negative
staphylococcus. Surgical excision combined with thirdgeneration cephalosporins could serve as an excellent
standard therapy for Kocuria varians brain abscess.
