mediterranei and their function in different PHBV
copolymer biosyntheses in Haloarcula hispanica

Abstract
Background: The halophilic archaeon Haloferax mediterranei is able to accumulate large amounts of poly(3hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) with high molar fraction of 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) from unrelated
carbon sources. A Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase composed of two subunits, PhaCHme and PhaEHme, has
been identified in this strain, and shown to account for the PHBV biosynthesis.
Results: With the aid of the genome sequence of Hfx. mediterranei CGMCC 1.2087, three additional phaC genes
(designated phaC1, phaC2, and phaC3) were identified, which encoded putative PhaCs. Like PhaCHme (54.8 kDa),
PhaC1 (49.7 kDa) and PhaC3 (62.5 kDa) possessed the conserved motifs of type III PHA synthase, which was not
observed in PhaC2 (40.4 kDa). Furthermore, the longer C terminus found in the other three PhaCs was also absent
in PhaC2. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) revealed that, among the four genes, only phaCHme was transcribed
under PHA-accumulating conditions in the wild-type strain. However, heterologous coexpression of phaEHme with
each phaC gene in Haloarcula hispanica PHB-1 showed that all PhaCs, except PhaC2, could lead to PHBV
accumulation with various 3HV fractions. The three kinds of copolymers were characterized using gel-permeation
chromatography (GPC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Their thermal
properties changed with the variations in monomer composition as well as the different molecular weights (Mw),
thus might meet various application requirements.
Conclusion: We discover three cryptic phaC genes in Hfx. mediterranei, and demonstrate that genetic engineering
of these newly identified phaC genes has biotechnological potential for PHBV production with tailor-made material
properties.

Background
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are polymers of hydroxyalkanoates and are synthesized by various bacteria and
some haloarchaeal strains [1]. The molecular weight of
PHAs is generally distributed in the range of 50,0001,000,000 Da, which is sufficient to provide these polymers with similar characteristics as conventional plastics
[2]. However, due to the high production cost of PHAs,
semi-commercial production has been realized only for
the two common polyesters, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)
(PHB) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate)

(PHBV) [3-5]. Recently, halophilic Archaea have been
attracting strong interest in PHBV research due to their
comparable advantages as PHA producers, including utilizing unrelated cheap carbon sources, non-strict sterilization and easy method for PHA extraction [6-8]. A few
haloarchaeal strains have been found to synthesize intracellular short-chain-length PHAs (scl-PHAs), PHB and
PHBV, to serve as carbon and energy storage [8-16].
Compared with PHB, PHBV possesses better polymer
properties and thus has wider applications in commodity materials [17-19]. Among the halophilic archaea,
Haloferax mediterranei is one of the best-studied strains
due to its capability to accumulate large amounts of
PHBV from inexpensive carbon sources, including glucose, starch, and whey [6-8,20,21]. Therefore, it has

been evaluated as one of the most promising candidate
prokaryotes for the industrial production of PHBV [7].
PHA synthases are the key enzymes of PHA synthesis
and catalyze the incorporation of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA
into PHAs. Over the past few decades, extensive
research has been devoted to the study of PHA
synthases in the domain of Bacteria. This enzyme is
grouped into four types in bacteria, according to its substrate specificity and subunit composition [22]. The typical bacterial type III synthase is composed of two
subunits, PhaE (~40 kDa) and PhaC (~40 kDa) [23]. In
the domain of Archaea, a novel PHA synthase homologous to the bacterial type III PHA synthase, with subunits designated PhaC Hme and PhaE Hme , has been
identified and characterized in Hfx. mediterranei [6]. As
in bacteria, the PHA synthase-encoding genes
(phaECHme) in Hfx. mediterranei are clustered and cotranscribed, and both PhaC Hme and PhaE Hme are
indispensable for the PHBV synthesis from multiple
unrelated carbon sources. The haloarchaeal PHA
synthase and bacterial type III synthase share some conserved residues (e.g., the Cys-Asp-His catalytic triad).
However, they are quite different in molecular weights
and several characteristic motifs. The PhaC Hme (54.8
kDa) is much larger than its bacterial counterparts, in
which the longer sequence at the C terminus has been
shown to be indispensable for enzyme activity [6]. In
contrast, the PhaEHme (~20 kDa) subunit is much smaller than its bacterial counterparts. Moreover, although
“PhaE box” is strongly conserved in PhaEs of bacteria, it
is missing in PhaEHme of Hfx. mediterranei.
Recently, the genome sequence of Hfx. mediterranei
CGMCC 1.2087 has been completed in our laboratory
(Han J. et al: Bioplastic production in the domain of
Archaea: insights from the genome sequence of Haloferax
mediterranei, in preparation). Intriguingly, sequence analysis revealed that three additional phaC paralogs (named
phaC1, phaC2, and phaC3) were present and scattered
throughout the whole genome. In this study, we compared
the features of PhaCHme and these three putative PhaC
proteins (PhaC1-PhaC3), and determined their capabilities
of PHA polymerizing in Haloarcula hispanica. Furthermore, the material properties of the produced polymers
were also characterized using multiple methods.

Results
Identification and analysis of the phaC genes in Hfx.
mediterranei

Hfx. mediterranei is comprised of one chromosome and
three extrachromosomal elements (megaplasmids) [24].
The genome sequence of Hfx. mediterranei CGMCC
1.2087 has been recently completed by our group. The
genes encoding its PHA synthase, named phaEHme and

Page 2 of 10

phaCHme, have already been cloned and characterized
[6] and were found to be located on megaplasmid
pHM300. Interestingly, analysis of the whole genome
sequence revealed that three other phaC paralogs
existed in this strain and were designated phaC1,
phaC2, and phaC3.
The phaC1 was mapped to the chromosome, whereas
phaC2 and phaC3 were both mapped to megaplasmid
pHM500 (Figure 1). Most of the genes adjacent to the
four phaCs encoded conserved hypothetical proteins
with unknown functions (Figure 1). The four PhaC proteins of Hfx. mediterranei exhibited homology to each
other (43%-58% identity), and they all contained the catalytic triad residues (Cys-Asp-His) (Figure 2). Both the
“Lipase box-like” sequence (Gly-X-Cys-X-Gly-Gly) and
the conserved motif of type III PHA synthase were present in PhaCHme, PhaC1, and PhaC3 (Figure 2). In the
case of PhaC2, the last “Gly” residue of the “Lipase boxlike” sequence was replaced by an “Ala”, and the conserved motif of the type III PHA synthase was also not
strongly conserved (Figure 2). The deduced molecular
weights of the four PhaCs were as follows: PhaCHme 54.8 kDa, PhaC1-49.7 kDa, PhaC2-40.4 kDa, and
PhaC3-62.5 kDa. Only the molecular weight of PhaCHme
was equivalent to that of the PhaCs from Haloarcula
marismortui (53.1 kDa; Accession no., YP_137339),
Haloarcula hispanica (53.0 kDa; Accession no.,
ABV71394), and Haloquadratum walsbyi (52.1 kDa,
Accession no., YP_658052). When compared with the
primary sequences of the other three PhaCs, the C
terminal sequence was missing in PhaC2, which resulted
in the smallest molecular weight.
Only phaCHmewas transcribed in Hfx. mediterranei in
laboratory conditions

In previous work, we found that the phaECHme-deleted
strain Hfx. mediterranei PHBV-1 could not accumulate
detectable scl-PHAs and expression of phaEHme alone
could not restore the ability to accumulate scl-PHAs [6],
which indicated that there were no additional functional
PhaC subunits in Hfx. mediterranei PHBV-1. To provide
some clues to this phenomenon, RT-PCR with gene-specific primer pairs for the four phaC genes (Table 1) was
employed to determine whether they were transcribed
in the wild-type strain. The lengths of the PCR products
of phaC Hme , phaC1, phaC2, and phaC3 were 382 bp,
391 bp, 408 bp, and 412 bp, respectively. The results
demonstrated that of the four genes, only phaCHme was
actively transcribed in MG medium (Figure 3A), which
was consistent with our previous observation that
PhaC Hme was indispensable for PHBV biosynthesis in
Hfx. mediterranei, as the other three phaCs were not
expressed.

Genetic analysis of the functions of the four PhaCs in
Haloarcula

To determine if phaC1, phaC2, and phaC3 could
encode functional proteins, a PHA synthase genedeleted strain, named Har. hispanica PHB-1 [13], was
used to heterologously express these proteins. Because
PhaC proteins were proposed to be functional combined

with the PhaE subunit, the three expression plasmids
designated pWL3EC1, pWL3EC2, and pWL3EC3
(Table 1) were constructed based on the PhaE Hme expression plasmid pWL3E [6] and individually introduced into Har. hispanica PHB-1. During fermentation,
Har. hispanica PHB-1/pWL3E [6] and the wild-type
strain were used as the negative and positive control,

respectively. To compare the PHBV synthesized by the
four PHA synthases with distinct PhaC subunits, Har.
hispanica PHB-1/pWL3EC [6] harboring the phaECHme
genes of Hfx. mediterranei was also employed.
Table 2 summarized the results of PHA accumulation
in Har. hispanica and its five transformants. Compared
with the wild-type strain, there was no significant difference in final cell yield as evaluated by cell dry weight
(CDW). The expression of PhaEHme alone or coexpression with PhaC2 did not lead to the synthesis of any

PHA. However, the other three PhaC proteins
(PhaC Hme , PhaC1 and PhaC2) were functional during
PHBV polymerization when excess glucose was supplied.
PHBV content accumulated in recombinant PHB-1
strains harboring PhaEC Hme (17.33%) or PhaEC1
(15.61%) was a little higher than that of wild type
(12.26%), and resulted in a much higher PHBV concentration of 0.99 g/l or 0.94 g/l, respectively, as compared
to 0.58 g/l in wild type. In the case of PhaC3, the PHBV
content (10.02%) and concentration (0.53 g/l) were

similar with that of wild type. Compared to that of wild
type, the 3HV monomer composition of PHBV was a
little higher for PhaEC1 (4.06 mol %), a little lower for
PhaEC3 (1.95 mol %), and equivalent for PhaEC Hme
(3.14 mol %). In short, three types of PHBV with altered
3HV fractions had been synthesized by the Har. hispanica PHB-1 recombinants with phaEHme and different
phaC genes.
Properties of PHBV synthesized by different PhaC
subunits

A 400 MHz 1H NMR study showed that the monomer
composition of PHBV produced by the wild-type strain
of Har. hispanica and its recombinants (data not
shown) was in agreement with that determined by the
GC analysis (Table 2). Table 3 listed the molecular
weights and thermal properties of the accumulated
PHBV in the recombinant strains of Har. hispanica
PHB-1. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and
polydispersity (M w /M n ) of the polymers were in the
range of 22.7-46.5 × 104 Da and of 1.83-2.16, respectively. The PHBV synthesized by PhaEC3 had the highest Mw of 91.0 × 104 Da, two times of that of the PHBV

produced by PhaEC1, but the PHBV production was
lower (Table 2).
DSC analysis showed that the glass-transition temperatures (T g ) of the PHBV samples were 2.3°C
(PhaECHme-PHBV), -0.1°C (PhaEC1-PHBV), and 5.7°C
(PhaEC3-PHBV). This result was consistent with the
3HV monomer composition of the three types of PHBV;
a larger amount of 3HV incorporated into PHBV could
lead to lower T g. A similar melting temperature (Tm )
was observed for all three PHBV samples, of which the
PHBV with the lowest Tm synthesized by PhaEC1 could
facilitate its processing ability. Compared with the other
two polymers, no cold crystallization temperature (Tc)
was detected for the PHBV accumulated by PhaEC3.
This result demonstrated that this polymer (with a high
3HB fraction) possessed a fast crystallization speed,
which could also provide some advantages in processing.
Thermal stability plays an important role in polymer
melt processing. This characteristic of the three types of
PHBV was determined by TGA (Table 3 and Figure 4).
The temperature at 5% weight loss (T d ) was used to
evaluate their polymer thermal stability. The Td of the
three polymers ranged from 252°C to 257°C. Our results
showed that the three types of PHBV, with different
monomer composition, changed obviously in their thermal properties.

Discussion
Multiple phaC genes in a same genome have been
found in the domain of Bacteria. The complete genome
sequence of Ralstonia eutropha has revealed the existence of a second phaC gene, which is not clustered
with the phaCAB operon, and its function has not been
clarified [25]. Additionally, Pseudomonas strains synthesizing medium-chain-length PHAs (mcl-PHAs) usually
have two different phaC genes, which are separated by a
phaZ gene that encodes an intracellular PHA depolymerase [1]. To date, the haloarchaeon Hfx. mediterranei
has been found to possess the largest number of phaC
genes. Compared with the other PhaC subunits from
haloarchaeal strains, the three newly identified PhaCs

showed less homology with PhaC Hme . A phylogenetic
tree was constructed based on the four PhaCs from Hfx.
mediterranei and seven other PhaCs from Halobacteriaceae; 3 PhaC sequences from Thaumarchaeota were
used as the outgroup (Figure 5). The PhaCs from Halobacteriaceae and those from Thaumarchaeota clustered
separately. PhaC Hme was more closely related to the
PhaCs from other haloarchaea than to its three paralogs
(Figure 5). It seemed likely that phaC1, phaC2 and
phaC3 were not directly acquired from a common
source of PhaC Hme , but possibly by horizontal DNA
transfer from other sources during evolution.
Of the four paralogs in Hfx. mediterranei, only
phaCHme was found to be transcribed under PHA-accumulating conditions by RT-PCR assays (Figure 3A).
However, the putative promoters (including the TATA
box and BRE element) of the other three phaC genes,
were also detected (Figure 3B). As both phaC1 and
phaC3 encoded functional proteins, it is conceivable
that these silent genes in Hfx. mediterranei might be
activated under specific ecological conditions to increase
the environmental distribution of this haloarchaeon.
Regardless of the conserved catalytic triad residues
(Cys-Asp-His) in the primary sequence, PhaC2 was
found to have no PHA polymerization activity. This
might be the result of the truncated C terminus, which
has been shown to be indispensable for PHA synthase
enzyme activity [6]. However, a recombinant PhaC2

containing the C terminus from PhaC3 does not have
the ability to synthesize PHAs (data not shown). Alternatively, less conserved motifs such as the “Ala” residue
in the “Lipase box-like” sequence or the lack of the conserved motif of PhaC might lead to its inactivity.
The incorporation of 3HV into PHB could improve
material flexibility. Three types of PHBV with different
monomer compositions were produced from the Har.
hispanica PHB-1 recombinants, and the type of PHBV
was supposed to be determined by the different substrate specificities of PhaCHme, PhaC1, and PhaC3. Hfx.
mediterranei has been found to be the best PHBV producer in the family Halobacteriaceae, and can accumulate the highest PHBV content (>60%) with the highest
3HV fraction from many unrelated cheap carbon
sources [7,20,21]. Compared with Har. hispanica, Hfx.
mediterranei has a stronger ability to provide more
3HB-CoA and 3HV-CoA monomers for PHA synthase.
Therefore, the use of these phaC genes in Hfx. mediterranei PHBV-1 to produce PHBV with higher 3HV fractions and different properties would have much more
promise, which could extend the applications of PHAs
in the future.

Conclusions
In this study, we mined three silent phaC genes (phaC1,
phaC2, and phaC3) from Hfx. mediterranei, which
encoded potential PhaCs subunits of PHA synthase. In

Har. hispanica PHB-1, the heterologous coexpression of
phaEHme with phaCHme, phaC1, or phaC3 could lead to
the accumulation of PHBV polymers with different
molecular weights and thermal properties from excess
glucose. Therefore, we concluded that genetic engineering of these phaC genes in Hfx. mediterranei would produce PHBV with desirable material properties, at lower
production costs.

Methods
Strains, plasmids, and growth conditions

The plasmids used in this study were listed in Table 1.
All of the plasmids were derivatives of pWL3E [6].

These plasmids were first constructed in Escherichia coli
JM109 and then introduced into Har. hispanica PHB-1,
a phaEC-deleted strain [13], using the polyethylene
glycol-mediated transformation method [26].
E. coli JM109 was cultivated in Luria-Bertani (LB)
medium at 37°C [27]. When needed, ampicillin (100
mg/l) was added to the medium. Har. hispanica and
Hfx. mediterranei were grown in AS-168 medium. For
growth on plates, the media described above were supplemented with 1.2% (w/v) agar. For PHA accumulation,
the haloarchaeal strains were transferred from AS-168
medium to MG medium and cultivated as previously
described [6]. When required, mevinolin was added to a

final concentration of 5 mg/l for H. hispanica recombinants. All of the strains were cultured at 37°C.

PHAs. PHBV (Sigma) was used as the standard for peak
identification. The average results of three parallel
experiments were recorded.

Primers and plasmid construction

All of the primers used in this study were summarized
in Table 1. To determine the capabilities of PhaC1,
PhaC2, and PhaC3 to synthesize PHAs, three expression
plasmids were constructed. The expression vectors were
derived from pWL3E, which contained the phaE Hme
gene of Hfx. mediterranei with its native promoter [6].
The coding sequences of phaC1, phaC2, and phaC3
were amplified from Hfx. mediterranei by PCR with
primer pairs phaC1-BamHI-F/phaC1-KpnI-R, phaC2BamHI-F/phaC2-KpnI-R, and phaC3-BamHI-F/phaC3KpnI-R, respectively. The purified PCR products
(phaC1, 1.3 kb; phaC2, 1.1 kb; phaC3, 1.7 kb) were
digested with BamHI and KpnI and inserted into
BamHI and KpnI-treated pWL3E. The resulting expression plasmids pWL3EC1, pWL3EC2, and pWL3EC3
were confirmed by DNA sequencing and individually
introduced into Har. hispanica PHB-1. The haloarchaeal
recombinants harboring pWL3EC [6], pWL3EC1,
pWL3EC2, and pWL3EC3 were subjected to PHA accumulation analysis in which Har. hispanica PHB-1 harboring pWL3E and the wild-type strain were used as the
negative and positive control, respectively.
Isolation of total RNA and reverse transcription PCR (RTPCR)

Total RNA of Hfx. mediterranei was extracted using
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) from a logarithmic-phase
culture grown in MG medium. Four specific primer
pairs, phaC-RT-F/phaC-RT-F, phaC1-RT-F/phaC1-RTF, phaC2-RT-F/phaC2-RT-F, and phaC3-RT-F/phaC3RT-F, were designed for the phaCHme, phaC1, phaC2,
and phaC3 genes, respectively (Table 1). Prior to RTPCR, the specificity of these primers were confirmed by
sequencing of the corresponding PCR products using
the genomic DNA of Hfx. mediterranei as template. For
RT-PCR, the RNA sample was digested with RNase-free
RQ1 DNase (Promega) overnight to eliminate any DNA
contamination, which was subsequently confirmed by a
control PCR without prior reverse transcription as previously described [28]. The DNA-free RNA sample was
then used as the template for RT-PCR using the OneStep RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The PCR products were
electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel.
Measurement of PHA content and composition

Scl-PHAs were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed
by gas chromatography (GC) with the Agilent GC-6820
as described previously [6,13]. Benzonic acid was used
as an internal standard to calculate the amount of

Extraction and purification of PHAs

After fermentation, the liquid cultures were harvested
by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in distilled water containing
0.1% SDS (w/v) and agitated for 20 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min and
yielded whitish, compact sediment. The sediment was
resuspended and washed twice with 0.1% SDS solution
(w/v) and distilled water, respectively. The resulting
paste was dried in an oven at 70°C for 2 h for further
purification. The extracted PHAs were treated with hot
chloroform at 90°C for 4 h, followed by precipitation
with 15 volume of pre-chilled ethanol. To obtain pure
product, the precipitate was then redissolved in chloroform and the process was repeated. The collected
PHAs were dried at 40°C for 24 h to remove all residual solvent.
Molecular weight determination of PHBV

The molecular weight of PHBV was estimated via gel
permeation chromatography (GPC) with a Waters 1515
system at 30°C using a Waters 1525 pump equipped
with a four Styragel column series (Styragel HR, 5 μm).
A differential refractive index detector and a UV detector were both employed. Chloroform was used as the
elution solvent at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The concentration of the samples was 2 mg/ml and the injection
volume was 50 μl. The calibration curve was generated
with polystyrene standards (Sigma).
Characterization of PHBV thermal properties

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed
using a TA Instruments Q100 with an autocool accessory calibrated with indium to characterize thermal
transitions of the polymers. The following protocol was
used for each sample. A 3-5 mg sample in an aluminum
pan was cooled from room temperature to -60°C by the
autocool accessory. The pan was heated from -60°C to
180°C at a rate of 10°C/min, isothermally maintained at
180°C for 5 min, quenched to -60°C, and reheated from
-60°C to 180°C at 10°C/min under a nitrogen flow rate
of 50 ml/min. Data were collected during the second
heating run.
Thermal stability of the PHA polymer was determined
via thermogravimetric analysis using a Q50 thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) (TA Instruments). The procedures used were as the same as those described by Xie
et al. [29]. Briefly, samples were analyzed at a heating
rate of 10°C/min under a nitrogen atmosphere with a
N2 flow rate of 60 ml/min.

Phylogenetic tree construction

The phylogenetic tree for PhaC was constructed using
the neighbor-joining method [30] with Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software version 4.0
[31]. The topology of the phylogenetic tree was evaluated by bootstrap analysis on the basis of 1000 replications [32].

Nucleotide and protein sequence analysis

Sequences of the PhaC proteins from Hfx. mediterranei
were deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers phaC Hme -EU374220, phaC1-HM116246, phaC2HM116247, and phaC3-HM116248. These PhaC
sequences were analyzed using the GeneDoc program
(http://www.nrbsc.org/gfx/genedoc/index.html).
