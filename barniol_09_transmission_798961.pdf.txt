Abstract
Background: The overall incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in Western Europe has been declining
since the 19th Century. However, immigrant sub-groups from high-prevalence countries are
slowing down this trend. The aim of this study was to describe how immigration influences TB
transmission in Germany. For that we prospectively investigated the dynamics of TB transmission
between TB high-prevalence immigrant and TB low-prevalence local populations with molecular
epidemiological methods and conventional contact investigations. Besides, we assessed
transmission in relation to social mixing using an innovative tool that measures the integration of
immigrants into the local social environment.
Methods: A prospective study of confirmed culture positive cases of pulmonary TB and their
contacts was carried out in a German federal state from 2003 to 2005. Data for the study included:
1) case data routinely collected by the local public health staff and transmitted to the state health
office and the national surveillance centre, 2) a study questionnaire designed to capture social
interactions of relevance for TB transmission and 3) molecular genotyping data (IS6110 DNA
fingerprint and spoligotyping). The proportion of German cases caused by foreign-born cases, and
vice versa, was estimated and an integration index was computed using a selected set of questions
from the study questionnaire.
Results: A total of 749 cases of culture-positive pulmonary tuberculosis voluntarily enrolled in the
study, representing 57.8% of all registered cases diagnosed over the study period. Data that
included study questionnaire and DNA fingerprinting were available for 41% (n = 308) of the study
participants. Forty-seven clusters, defined as a least two cases infected by the same TB strains, were
identified by molecular methods and included 132 (17%) of the study participants. Epidemiological
links were identified for 28% of the clusters by conventional epidemiological data. In mixed clusters,

defined as clusters including German and foreign-born individuals, the probability of cases to be
caused by foreign-born cases was estimated at 18.3%. We observed a trend to mixed clusters with
increasing time spent by immigrants in the host country. This group also presented comparatively
higher integration indexes than immigrants in immigrant-only clusters.
Conclusion: Our results confirm the findings of other studies that there is no significant TB
transmission from TB high-prevalence immigrant to TB low-prevalence autochthonous population.
This may be explained by the good performance of tuberculosis screening programmes for certain
groups arriving in Germany from high- prevalence countries, by a low degree of mixing of
immigrants with the local population or by a combination of both.

Background
Although the incidence of TB in Western Europe has been
steadily declining in the last decades, immigrants coming
from high-endemic areas are slowing down this trend.
There are 7.3 million foreigners living in Germany, 8.9%
of the total population. The incidence of tuberculosis in
foreign citizens was 27.4 per 100,000 in 2005. This was
5.4 times higher than in Germans [1]. The impact on the
epidemiology and the transmission patterns of TB need to
be captured and understood to adapt TB control strategies. Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) fingerprinting of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) provides a powerful tool
to trace and identify TB transmission chains and outbreaks. Linkages of this information to unique features of
sub-populations including social behaviour and integration patterns will facilitate the identification of chains of
transmission and, ultimately, the design and implementation of appropriate control strategies.
Our study objectives were to prospectively describe the
dynamics of TB transmission between immigrant and
local populations in one of the federal states of Germany
(Baden-Württemberg) with the help of molecular epidemiological tools and traditional contact investigations
and to assess transmission in relation to the degree of integration. For this purpose we used a new tool to measure
integration among sub-groups with the help of an integration index, which was computed based on a selected set of
answers to the study questionnaire about socio-economic,
social behaviour and integration issues.

portion of epidemiologically confirmed clusters, for those
studies with available data, has remained quite low (10 to
31%).

Methods
A prospective study of incident confirmed culture-positive
cases of pulmonary TB, from this point onwards referred
as cases, and their contacts as identified through the public health authorities was carried out in Baden-Württemberg, Germany from 01.01.2003 to 31.12.2005 [16,17].
Data source
Data for the study were obtained from:

1) case data routinely collected by the local public health
staff using standard reports and, once depersonalized,
transmitted via the state health office of Baden-Württemberg to the national surveillance centre, Robert Koch Institute (RKI). The data include demographic and clinical
data of the patient, laboratory results, Drug Susceptibility
Tests (DST), and treatment outcomes (success, failure,
death, defaulters) according to the WHO working group
recommendations [18].

Several studies have already addressed the issue of TB
transmission between populations from high- and lowprevalence countries in different countries. Most of them
are retrospective molecular epidemiological studies [2-7]
or studies combining DNA fingerprinting with traditional
contact investigations [8-15]. Generally, no major risk of
transmission from immigrants into the autochthonous
population has been found.

2) Study questionnaire specifically designed to capture
social interactions of relevance for TB transmission. The
following variables were assessed: age, gender, nationality, country of birth, year of arrival in Germany, number
of visits to the country of birth and length of the visit, relatives/friends still living in the country of birth, postal
code in Germany, type of housing, number of rooms,
number of people living in the same house/sharing the
same room and their nationality, nationality of the neighbours, profession and occupation, nationality of colleagues/classmates, where and with whom spare time is
spent, behavioural habits (smoking, eating warm meals,
alcohol drinking), known contact to other TB patients,
knowledge of German language. See additional file 1:
Study questionnaire in English, and

The proportion of cases in DNA fingerprint clusters in the
above studies has ranged from 15.8% to 59% and the pro-

(RFLP) (for details see below).
Immigrant TB cases were defined as individuals whose
country of birth was not Germany, even if they later
acquired German citizenship. Children of immigrants
born in Germany were considered Germans. The statistics
of immigrants living in Baden-Württemberg were
retrieved from the Statistisches Landesamt Baden-Württemberg (available at: http://www.statistik-portal.de/Bevoe
lkGebiet/Landesdaten/LRt0601.asp). Figures from the
Statistics Bureau are based on nationality of the immigrants and do not include the foreign-born who have
acquired German nationality (i.e. German resettlers), thus
underestimating the proportion of immigrants.
The tuberculosis screening program for immigrants varies
according to the very heterogeneous groups of migrants in
Germany. Asylum seekers and some sub-groups of immigrants (e.g. German resettlers (in German Spätaussiedler)
from the Former Soviet Union (FSU) and East Europe) are
actively screened for active disease at the time of arrival in
Germany [19,20] and treated as needed according to the
German social welfare Law for asylum seekers ("Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz").
Genotyping and cluster identification
All cultures available at the NRC were analysed by IS6110
DNA fingerprinting (IS6110-RFLP) and spoligotyping
according to an internationally standardized protocol as
described elsewhere [21,22].

The DNA typing patterns were digitized, analysed with the
Bionumerics software (version 4.5, Applied Maths, StMartin-Latem, Belgium) and stored in a database. Subsequently a cluster analysis was performed as follows:
IS6110 RFLP clusters were defined based on fully identical
patterns (the same number of IS6110 bands and identical
positions [positions tolerance, 1.2%]). DNA fingerprint
and spoligotype patterns were reported to the study centre
in Heidelberg and to the local health authorities for further epidemiological analysis. Furthermore, based on genotyping results, the strains were classified into main
MTBC (Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex) genotypes to
allow the analysis of possible associations between strains
genotype and patient characteristics.
Recent studies have shown that the MTBC strains can be
subdivided in several phylogentic lineages that are differentially prevalent in different geographical areas [23,24].
Furthermore, there is growing evidence that strains of the
MTBC are genetically more diverse than previously anticipated and that this genetic heterogeneity indeed influ-

ences the transmissibility and virulence of clinical isolates
[25,26].
Genotype identification was carried out by using the
MIRU-VNTRplus webpage [27].
Contact investigations were performed routinely on all
cases. Once clusters were confirmed using molecular genotyping, public health offices with clustered patients were
requested to extend their general contact investigations
through systematic review of patient records and re-interviews to verify the duration and nature of possible contacts, etc. (epidemiological contact tracing). Three types of
links were established through conventional epidemiological methods: 1) patients with definite epidemiologic
links, 2) patients with probable links, or 3) patients with
possible links [28].
Anti TB drug resistance was extracted from the case reports
and recorded where available. These data were used as
additional information to identify clusters with recent
transmission.
Estimation of transmission
To estimate the proportion of German cases caused by
immigrant cases only clustered isolates were considered,
since no information on transmission was available for
the unique isolates. The proportion of German cases
caused by foreign-born cases was estimated as follows: We
denoted i = 1,..., i be the index for clusters, I the number
of clusters, Ji the number of members in cluster i, j the

index for the j-th member in that cluster and finally pijk the
probability that cluster member j of cluster i was infected
Ji

by cluster member k of that cluster such that

∑ p ij
=1

=1.

For these probabilities we made the following assumptions:
- If from epidemiological tracing the chain of infection
is known, then p ij * = 1 for that member κ* of the
cluster which infected member j and pijκ = 0 for all
other members
- If the date of diagnosis differs more than 12 months
between two individuals within a cluster, then the
probability that the individual with the earlier diagnosis was infected by the other is low and for estimation
processes set to zero.
- If no epidemiological tracing was possible, the probability pijk was estimated as 1/(number of individuals

We compared this estimate with the respective probability

cases in foreigners and Germans.
We also estimated the corresponding proportion of foreign cases caused by German cases for which the same
method applies.
Calculation of integration index
An integration index for immigrants was calculated based
on the standardized score sum of 11 selected variables
from the study questionnaire. Missing values were
assigned a zero. The integration index was standardized to
range from 0 to 10 by a linear transformation. For a list of

Incident cases in study period: 1291

The study population and sub-groups are displayed in Figure 1: Study population sub-groups and type of data collected. A total of 749 cases of culture-positive pulmonary
tuberculosis were enrolled in the study, representing 58%
of all cases (n = 1291) diagnosed in Baden-Württemberg
over the study period, including 7 cases that belonged to
clusters but were diagnosed or reported in late 2002 (2
cases) or early 2006 (5 cases) and who agreed to have their
isolates typed. In our study the average incidence rate for
the period 2003-2005 was 4.0 per 100.000 of culture positive pulmonary TB.
Study questionnaires were filled in and sent to the study
centre for 380 of these 749 cases (51%). For all study participants, national epidemiological surveillance data were
available. Epidemiological contact tracing information
was collected for 671 contacts.
As of March 2006, isolates for 636 cases were received at
the NRC. Removing the cases that were atypical mycobacteria, double-registered, misclassified or for which culture
did not grow, and adding the 7 cases belonging to 2002
and 2006, DNA fingerprinting results were available for
555 cases (74% of all culture-positive cases participating
in the study).
Complete data (epidemiological data, study questionnaire and results of the DNA fingerprinting) were available for 308 (41%) of the study participants.

The profile of the study participants did not differ from

gender (62% males, 37% females), age distribution
(mean 49.6 years for males SD: 18.7; mean 47.3 years for
females SD: 22.8, nationality and country of birth. Foreign-born study participants were significantly younger
than Germans, this being more accentuated in the case of
male immigrants (mean 46 years 95% CI 43.8 - 48.3 versus mean 53.7 years 95% CI 51.2- 56.2 for German male.
Female immigrants had mean 44 years (95% CI: 40.9 47.2) compared to a mean 52.8 years (95% CI: 47.9 57.7) for German females.

The proportion of immigrants enrolled in the study was
57.7% (432/749). While 40.7% of the study participants
were born in Germany, 57% actually had German nationality. This is due to the fact that an important sub-group
of the foreign-born in our study population, the so-called
German resettlers, are ethnic Germans born in the FSU
(11%) and in East Europe (5%) who, since 1986, have
been given the chance to immigrate to Germany and
obtain German citizenship. The second largest group of
immigrants were those coming from East Europe (10%).
Turkish immigrants alone represented 6.4% of the total
foreign-born population. The rest (34%) of the immigrants came from 43 different countries. For 12 cases
(1.6%) no country of birth was recorded. The proportion
of immigrants in Baden-Württemberg per year compared
with the proportion of the immigrant TB cases of all TB
cases in Baden-Württemberg per year remained constant
over the three year study period: immigrants accounted
for around 12% of the total population (10.7 million)
and for 57% of the total reported cases [29].
Clusters based on molecular typing data
As summarized in Table 1, of the study participants for
which mycobacterial genotyping were available (n = 555),
132 (24%) were classified into 47 DNA fingerprint clusters and the rest (66%) had a unique isolate. Of the 132
clustered isolates, 69 belonged to foreign-born, 60 to
native-born Germans and for 3 cases no country of birth
was available. Cluster sizes ranged from 2 to 9 persons.
There were a total of 28 multinational clusters (composed
of cases from 2 to 4 different countries), of which 16 were
mixed clusters (with Germans and immigrants) and 12
were immigrant clusters. 21 of the 28 multinational clusters were represented by two countries and those with
most representation (4 countries) were mainly composed
of immigrants from different FSU countries.

Regarding the uninational clusters, there were a total of 14
clusters with German cases only and 4 immigrant clusters
composed of cases from the same country. For one cluster
information on country of birth was missing. In the mixed
clusters we included three clusters with children born in
Germany with migration background.
Among the MTBC genotypes that were identified in the
study population, we looked in particular into the most
frequent genotypes with the largest numbers of cases (Beijing and Haarlem) and we observed that the Beijing genotype was predominantly found in individuals born in the
FSU with more than half of the cases belonging to clusters.
The Haarlem genotype, instead, was mainly found in German and in East European cases with only one fifth of the
cases being in clusters. Haarlem clusters were smaller (2
patients) than the Beijing ones (2 to 9 patients).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/197

To scrutinize the correlation of clusters over time after
arrival in Germany we plotted the time lag between arrival
and diagnosis of TB stratified by immigrants of mixed
clusters, immigrant clusters and non-clustered cases
where data was available. See Figure 2: Time between
arrival in Germany and diagnosis in the immigrant subgroup.
Of the cases diagnosed within four years after arrival, 40
(71%) did not belong to a DNA fingerprint cluster. Two
cases diagnosed within the first 48 months after arrival in
Germany were found to belong to a mixed cluster: one
from Nepal with a Delhi genotype diagnosed 11 months
after arrival and one from Bosnia with a Haarlem genotype diagnosed 29 months after arrival in Germany. Fourteen cases were grouped in 6 immigrant clusters: 3 with
Beijing genotype, 1 with Cameroon genotype and 2
unclassified. At a time span of one year between arrival
and diagnosis, we find 24 cases, 12 in clusters and 12 nonclustered. Almost half of these cases originate from the
FSU. Of interest is that 8 of the clustered cases had a Beijing genotype and all except one case came from the FSU.
The other 4 clustered cases had Cameroon, East African
Indian (EAI), Delhi and unclassified genotypes.
Epidemiological links
For 13 (28%) of the 47 DNA fingerprint clusters, epidemiologic links between some members of the clusters could
be identified. These 13 clusters include 32 individuals, for
26 of whom epidemiological links could be found. That
is, for 19.7% of all clustered cases epidemiologic links
were identified and confirmed. The majority of cases in
these clusters (n = 10) had a definite epidemiologic link
(members of a same family or household), followed by
cases with a probable link (n = 3), namely people frequenting the same milieu and one of the cases was
infected at work (health professional working with TB
patients). For two clusters possible links between cluster
members were suspected (homeless shelter), but could
not be confirmed.
Transmission risk
In our setting the proportion of German cases caused by
foreign-born cases was estimated at 18.3% (95% CI: 8.3 28.3%). This calculation was based on 56 individuals
whose date of diagnosis was within 12 months from
another cluster member's. For this analysis we excluded
those "mixed" clusters with immigrants and their children
born in Germany. This is an overall estimate and it must
be noted that the age of diagnosis for German cases in
mixed clusters is lower than for Germans in German-only
clusters (8.7 years lower in males and 11.6 years lower in
females). This indicates that the above proportion
decreases with age.

According to the TB case reports of Baden-Württemberg,
over the years 2003 to 2005, 58% of all TB cases were foreign-born. If we assume a constant immigration of
infected foreign-born persons and a random mixing
between Germans and the foreign-born, we would also
expect that 58% of all new infections in German cases are
from a foreign-born person. Since our estimate is considerably lower, we concluded that there is no random mixing.
The estimated proportion of foreign cases caused by Germans is 16.0% (95% CI: 7.6 - 24.3%). This estimate is
based on 74 foreign-born cases. This low percentage
shows a high transmission of disease within foreigners,

since, assuming random mixing, we would expect 100% 58% = 42% cases caused by Germans.
Degree of integration (Integration index)
The integration index was computed for the 217 immigrants with available questionnaires (corresponding to
57% of all the questionnaires received). For the correlation between integration index and time spent in Germany we used the year of arrival given in the study
questionnaires, when this information was available (n =
207). Of these, 41 belonged to a DNA fingerprint cluster
(26 to an immigrant-only cluster and 15 to a mixed cluster).

sub-group.

After omitting an outlier case who arrived in Germany in
1920, we observed that the mean crude integration index
differed between the two groups of interest: immigrants in
mixed clusters (mean: 4.57 (CI: 3.41 - 5.73) versus immigrants in immigrant-only clusters (mean 1.88: CI: 0.98 2.79). However, further linear regression analysis showed
that this difference is not significant after adjustment for
duration of residence. For illustration see Figure 3: Distribution of the integration index in a mixed cluster versus
an immigrant-only cluster over time. Small numbers,
however, do not allow further conclusions. Moreover, this
analysis includes some immigrants in clusters (mixed or
immigrant), which may in fact not be the result of recent
transmission.
Specific cluster types
We selected and interpreted (see discussion) some of the
most representative clusters for each genotype:

1) Beijing genotype: cluster 3 is an immigrant cluster with
individuals born in different FSU countries, where the Beijing genotype is known to be highly endemic. Cluster 35
is a mixed cluster with two immigrants and one German,
with one of the immigrants and the German presenting
the same Multi-Drug Resistance (MDR) pattern.
2) Cameroon genotype: cluster 9 is an immigrant cluster
with one case from Togo and one case from Cameroon,
where this genotype is endemic.
3) Delhi genotype: cluster 43 is a mixed cluster with an
immigrant from Nepal (where this genotype is endemic)
and a German. Cluster 15 is an epidemiologically confirmed "mixed" cluster with a Kenyan mother, her friend
and her two children born in Germany. In contrast to cluster 15, there are no epidemiological links available to confirm cluster 43.

4) EAI genotype: cluster 5 is an immigrant cluster with a
case from Romania and a case from the Philippines, and
cluster 14 is an immigrant cluster with three Pakistanis.
No contact tracing information is available for either of
the clusters.
5) Haarlem genotype: cluster 12 and 45 are mixed clusters
with a German and a Bosnian and a German and Yugoslavian (three countries where this genotype is endemic)
with no epidemiological information available linking
the members of these clusters. Cluster 8 is a German-only
cluster formed by two individuals who had close contact,
which has been confirmed through contact investigations.
6) LAM genotype: mixed cluster 6 is formed by a German
and a Brazilian from a LAM endemic area.

side the study period). A young Czech female contact was
diagnosed end of 2002. In July 2003, molecular typing of
a German contact showed an identical pattern with the
index case. The third case diagnosed during the study
period is an Iranian young male with no apparent connection to the others. The fourth case, diagnosed in April
2005, is a German female with contact to the index case.
In December 2005, a young second generation Turkish
man born in Germany was diagnosed. Seemingly, no contact exists between this case and the rest. For those with
DST (Drug Sensitivity Test) information available, resistance patterns are identical.

collected epidemiological and molecular data and data on
social interaction between sub-groups from high- (immigrants) and low- (Germans) prevalence countries. To the
best of our knowledge this it is the first time that someone
has attempted to develop a tool to prospectively measure
integration to better understand TB transmission between
immigrants and the local population in a given country.
The study questionnaire developed allowed us to collect
not only data on social habits and interaction between
groups, but also socio-economic and demographic data
and data on risk behaviours associated with TB.
Of the 57.8% study participants born outside Germany,
almost one third were German resettlers from the FSU and
East Europe, followed by immigrants from Turkey and
Sub-Saharan Africa. As in other studies, the well known
phylogeographical distribution of mycobacterieal genotypes was observed in the study participants [30,24,23].
Cases from the FSU presented mainly strains of the Beijing
lineage, while among the Germans and the East Europeans the Haarlem lineage was more common. The percentage of clustered cases was higher among patients of a
Beijing genotype than patients of a Haarlem genotype.
With these findings it cannot fully be elucidated if the
clustered cases indicate recent transmission in Germany
or importation of strains that are endemic in particular
home countries, i.e. a Beijing strain from the FSU. As in
the case of Somalis in the Netherlands [3], Denmark [12]
and London [31], reactivation of imported strains is likely
to explain why clusters with cases from the FSU without
any obvious epidemiological link occur in Germany. To
determine whether transmission took place outside the
country prior to immigration, in a reception centre after
arrival or whether it is simply an endemic strain predominant in the area of origin depends on in depth epidemiological contact tracing investigations. There is an urgent
need for enhanced international comparison of RFLP patterns to help confirming recent transmission.
Furthermore, when interpreting TB data we have to keep
in mind that the risk of developing TB is greater in the first
year after arrival in the host country [32] and that clustering of MTB in foreign-born persons increases with the
duration of residence, which suggests that transmission of
imported strains into the autochthonous population may
occur after a lag time [33].
The analysis of the time lag between arrival in Germany
and diagnosis shows that two thirds of the cases diagnosed within a year after arrival in Germany were from
FSU and that half of them where diagnosed in the first
month (Figure 2). This illustrates that screening programs
for German resettlers in Germany [19,20] effectively target

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/197

patients with imported TB belonging to this sub-group.
Furthermore, the same analysis of the time lag between
arrival in the host country and diagnosis confirmed that
little transmission into the autochthonous population
took place. Within 48 months between arrival in Germany and diagnosis of TB we only found two mixed clusters, one of which, as we will discuss later, may not even
be the result of recent transmission.
A range of clusters for the most representative genotypes
were selected to discuss (a) the problem of interpreting
DNA fingerprint clusters as recent transmission versus
being the result of imported endemic strains, (b) the significance of 'mixed clusters' for recent transmission
between high-incidence populations (immigrants) and
low-incidence populations (Germans), (c) the significance of endemic strains (e.g. Beijing, Haarlem) and (d)
the concept of the integration index and its importance
for understanding transmission dynamics in and between
sub-groups:
1) The fact that most cases in Beijing immigrant cluster 3
were diagnosed within 1-6 months after arrival in Germany makes it very unlikely that transmission took place
in one of the reception centres. We therefore assumed that
this was a cluster indicating importation of a strain that is
highly endemic in the FSU. However, recent transmission
in Germany cannot be entirely ruled out, especially for
those cases with the same DST pattern. Given the lack of
epidemiological information from the contact investigations, this second hypothesis could not be proven. The
same limitation applies to interpret cluster 35. This mixed
cluster with two immigrants and one German case could
represent recent transmission in Germany (see the identical DST pattern of the German and one of the immigrant
isolates). While we observe comparatively low integration
indexes in the immigrant cluster, the integration index in
the mixed cluster is much higher.
2) Cameroon cluster 9 may be the result of recent transmission in Germany, with the case from Cameroon infecting the case from Togo. However, given the absence of
epidemiological data linking the two cases this assumption could not be confirmed.
3) Although only one of the selected Delhi clusters was
confirmed through contact investigations, we believe
both clusters illustrate recent transmission in Germany:
cluster 43 is a mixed cluster with an immigrant from a
high-endemic country (Nepal) showing a high integration
index and a German. Cluster 15 is an epidemiologically
confirmed "mixed" cluster formed by a Kenyan mother,
her two children born in Germany and a friend from
Kenya visiting the family.

4) EAI cluster 5, with a Romanian and a Filipino, may represent recent transmission in Germany. Since no epidemiological information linking the two is available and this
genotype is not endemic in either of the two countries, we
reached the conclusion that both cases might have been
infected by a case not captured in the cluster/study period.
Cluster 14, instead, is an immigrant cluster formed by 3
cases from a highly EAI endemic country (Pakistan) with
no apparent epidemiological link and thus pointing in the
direction of an imported endemic strain.
5) As shown before, cluster 12 is a Haarlem mixed cluster
with a German and a Bosnian, which, in the absence of
epidemiologic information linking the two cases and the
fact that the diagnosis dates are more than one year apart,
we tend to interpret as casual contact of two cases from
two countries where this genotype is endemic. The nonGerman case shows a relatively low integration index.
Cluster 45 with a case from Germany and former Yugoslavia may also be an endemic cluster, since the DST patterns
also differ.
6) LAM mixed cluster 6, with a German and a Brazilian,
led us to the conclusion that since the LAM genotype is
endemic in Brazil this cluster may be due to recent transmission in Germany. The Brazilian has been in Germany
since 1957 and has a very high integration index.
As illustrated by the above examples, we observed a trend
whereby most immigrants in mixed clusters showed
higher integration indexes than immigrants in immigrantonly clusters, supporting our hypothesis that the higher
the degree of integration in the host country the higher the
likelihood to belong to a mixed cluster. This trend corroborates the strength of the tool in measuring integration
among sub-groups. It is accepted that social marginalization, including associated factors such as alcohol abuse
and nutritional deficiencies, pose a risk factor for TB [34].
We are sure that the investigation of integration patterns
and its impact on TB transmission will be a helpful tool to
design measures for TB prevention, control and treatment
which are adapted and responsive to the needs of specific
groups such as immigrants, but also other marginalized
groups (i.e. homeless, drug addicts, etc.). With increasing
numbers of studies in different countries and cities it has
become clear that there is substantial setting specific variation in transmission patterns. A standardized tool for
measuring integration patterns in relation to TB transmission might also be useful for comparison between countries.
In our study, the probability of cases among mixed clusters to be caused by a foreign-born case was 18.3%. This is
much lower than expected under random transmission

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/197

(58%). We can therefore conclude that integration is far
from random with limited social interaction between foreigners and the autochthonous population. This rate
includes two clusters (Haarlem cluster 12 and 46) which,
as argued before, may not be a result of recent transmission. If this is true, the rate we give even overestimates the
actual transmission risk meaning that the actual probability of cases to be caused by a foreign-born case would be
even lower. The risk of transmission from immigrants to
the local population from other published molecular
studies vary between 17% in the Netherlands [3] to very
low transmission rates in Denmark (0,9%) [12], Norway
[7] or in cities like London [26], New York [2] or Hamburg (2.8%), where the study focused on a marginalized
population.
If we look again at the mixed clusters we would like to
note that of the 16 mixed clusters, apparently 7 were first
identified in native-born Germans (35, 43, 12, 46, 31, 4
and 11). In cluster 43 and 31 the time difference between
the identification of the German (supposedly index case)
and the immigrant is less than one year, therefore it is still
possible that the one with later diagnosis may have
infected the earlier one. Mixed clusters with a German
index case support, once again, our conclusion that the
effect of imported TB on transmission into the autochthonous population is lower than expected.
Cluster 5, 24, 22, 41, 20 and 27 suggest that recent transmission amongst immigrant sub-groups is taking place in
Germany. This is certainly a problem that deserves further
research. However, our study sub-population sizes were
not sufficient to carry out further stratification.
As most studies, our study may underestimate recent
transmission due to the limited time of observation. The
full size of the clusters is not captured due to the fact that
TB transmission chains are building up slowly and delays
in diagnosis can be substantial. One recent study in Norway analyzed retrospectively the transmission dynamics
of TB between sub-groups over an extended period of time
[7]. They found that in twelve years, imported TB by
immigrants from high-incidence countries had little influence on the transmission into the receiving low-incidence
country. On average per year, only 2 non-immigrants and
13 immigrants developed disease as a result of transmission within the country by imported TB.
A limitation of our study was that only half of the study
participants completed the study questionnaire. This may
be in part explained by the situation of the foreign-born
study participants (mobility of the immigrants, language
barriers, fear of legal consequences, etc.). Translating the
questionnaire into eleven languages could not overcome

BMC Infectious Diseases 2009, 9:197

the language barrier. The crucial issue appears to be the
capacity of the local and state health offices to support the
data collection at the scale needed for a complete coverage.

Conclusion
In order to describe TB transmission dynamics between
high- and low- endemic populations it is necessary to be
able to distinguish between recent transmission and activation of imported endemic strains. Molecular typing is a
valuable contribution to epidemiological analysis provided it is combined with thorough epidemiological
investigations. As our study results reveal, contact investigations would need further improvement. Having this in
mind, the results obtained in this study confirm the findings of other studies that TB transmission from TB highprevalence immigrant populations to TB low-prevalence
local populations is lower than one would expect under
random transmission. This may be explained by the good
performance of TB screening programmes at entry for certain migrant groups arriving in the host country from
high-prevalence countries, by a low degree of integration
between immigrants and the local population or by a
combination of both.
Measuring the integration of immigrants into the local
social environment showed a trend supporting the
hypothesis that immigrants in mixed clusters had higher
integration indexes than those in immigrant clusters. Furthermore, we are convinced that this tool has great potential to improve control by measuring the degree of
integration and its impact on TB transmission in settings
with low-prevalence TB in the local population and immigration from high-incidence countries.
One goal of this investigation at the local level of the public health offices was achieved: the preparation and participation in this study effectively refined contact tracing
instruments in Baden-Württemberg. This study demonstrates that a combination of conventional contact tracing
in high risk groups with the input of molecular typing
data improves targeted case management of tuberculosis
in heterogeneous populations.
