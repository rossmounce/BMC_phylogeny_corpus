Abstract
Background: Duplication, followed by fixation or random loss of novel genes, contributes to
genome evolution. Particular outcomes of duplication events are possibly associated with
pathogenic life histories in fungi. To date, differential gene gain and loss have not been studied at
genomic scales in fungal pathogens, despite this phenomenon's known importance in virulence in
bacteria and viruses.
Results: To determine if patterns of gene duplication differed between pathogens and nonpathogens, we identified gene families across nine euascomycete and two basidiomycete species.
Gene family size distributions were fit to power laws to compare gene duplication trends in
pathogens versus non-pathogens. Fungal phytopathogens showed globally altered patterns of gene
duplication, as indicated by differences in gene family size distribution. We also identified sixteen
examples of gene family expansion and five instances of gene family contraction in pathogenic
lineages. Expanded gene families included those predicted to be important in melanin biosynthesis,
host cell wall degradation and transport functions. Contracted families included those encoding
genes involved in toxin production, genes with oxidoreductase activity, as well as subunits of the
vacuolar ATPase complex. Surveys of the functional distribution of gene duplicates indicated that
pathogens show enrichment for gene duplicates associated with receptor and hydrolase activities,
while euascomycete pathogens appeared to have not only these differences, but also significantly
more duplicates associated with regulatory and carbohydrate binding functions.
Conclusion: Differences in the overall levels of gene duplication in phytopathogenic species versus
non-pathogenic relatives implicate gene inventory flux as an important virulence-associated process
in fungi. We hypothesize that the observed patterns of gene duplicate enrichment, gene family
expansion and contraction reflect adaptation within pathogenic life histories. These adaptations
were likely shaped by ancient, as well as contemporary, intimate associations with monocot hosts.

Background
Change in gene inventory in pathogenic genomes is an
important evolutionary signal. Previous studies have documented the relationship between virulence and differential gene gain and/or loss in bacteria and viruses [1-8].
However, this phenomenon remains unexamined at a
genomic scale in fungal pathogens.
Our exploration of patterns of differential gene gain and
loss in pathogenic fungal genomes was prompted by two
possibly related observations. First, gene counts in phytopathogenic euascomycete species and fungus-like plant
parasites, such as species of Phytophthora, are often higher
than those for the most closely related non-pathogenic
genomes [9-17]. Second, some of the additional genes
identified in these pathogens are predicted to have roles in
secondary metabolism and managing encounters with
hosts [10,13,18-21]. For instance, polyketide synthetases
and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases are essential for
toxin production, while G protein-coupled receptors and
cytochrome P450s are critical for host perception and
quenching infection-related oxidative stress [10,22-26].
The differential expansion of a gene family by duplication
in a particular species is termed lineage-specific gene family expansion (LSE) [22,24,27,28]. Selection for virulence
could induce LSE among particular gene families
[10,11,13,18,22,24,29,30], as well as contraction among
other families [31,32]. Size differences between the
genomes of pathogenic and non-pathogenic species will
depend on the relative rates of gene duplication, gene loss
and horizontal transfer events. Two evolutionary trends
that would result in larger genomes among pathogens are
the consistent expansion of certain gene families
[10,11,26], as well as pathogens' apparent affinity for
gene acquisition through horizontal transfer [33-35].
However, it is also known that the number of genes in the
genomes of opportunistic human fungal pathogens [3640] appears to be reduced, as compared to non-pathogenic relatives, suggesting that gene loss may also be
increased among some pathogens [41].
In the present study, we evaluated patterns of gene duplication in pathogens versus non-pathogens and in phylogenetically-informed paired species comparisons. We
subsequently explored potential functional differences
among duplicate genes in pathogens as compared to nonpathogens. In addition, we investigated trends of gene
gain and loss in pathogenic fungal genomes.

Results
Altered patterns of gene duplication among diverse fungi
Gene duplicates identified by GenomeHistory in the
eleven sequenced fungal genomes were grouped into gene
families via single linkage clustering procedures (Meth-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/147

ods). Figure 1 and Table 1 give the number of gene families of size two or greater that met all minimum threshold
criteria, as well as the total number genes in gene families
for each species. U. maydis, a basally branching hemibiotrophic pathogenic basidiomycete lineage, had the fewest
gene families and the least number of genes in gene families, while the opportunistic euascomycete pathogen A.
flavus possessed the greatest number of gene families, and
also the largest number of genes in gene families.
We initially predicted greater proportions of duplicated
genes would become fixed in pathogenic lineages as a
result of increased preservation of duplicated genes by
natural selection and/or higher rates of duplication. In
this coevolutionary arms race scenario, continually evolving host resistance would give rise to constant selective
pressure for the preservation of duplications of genes relevant to virulence [20,42,43]. We thus compared the distributions of gene family sizes in pathogens versus nonpathogens. The distribution of gene family sizes in a
genome is thought to follow a power law distribution [4447], and we therefore modeled the pooled set of pathogenic gene families as following this distribution. Similarly, we allowed the pooled set of non-pathogenic gene
families to follow a power law distribution, with a potentially different value of the power law coefficient, a (which
describes the frequency of gene families of each size; see
Methods). We then applied a likelihood ratio test to
examine the null hypothesis that the value of a was the
same in pathogens as in non-pathogens.
Although we can reject the hypothesis of equal values of a
(P < 10-8), surprisingly, in view of our initial prediction,
we find that non-pathogenic fungi in fact have slightly
larger gene families than do the pathogens (a = 4.14 verses
a = 4.29 for pathogens). Interestingly, when the two basidiomycete species (P. chyrosporium and U. maydis) are
excluded from the analysis, no overall significant differences in gene family size distribution are evident (P =
0.14). We also compared lineages that were primary pathogens (U. maydis, M. grisea, F. graminearum and S. nodorum) to their non-pathogenic relatives (P. chrysosporium,
A. nidulans, N. crassa and T. reesei), finding again that the
non-pathogens have larger gene families (a = 4.57 and
4.26, respectively, P < 10-17). Again, excluding the basidiomycete species results in no significant difference being
found (P = 0.28). Finally, we examined only the Aspergillus
species, comparing the opportunistic pathogens A. flavus
and A. fumigatus to A. nidulans and A. oryzae. No significant differences in gene family sizes are evident in the
comparison between opportunistic pathogens and their
non-pathogenic relatives (P = 0.15).
The above approach is potentially flawed, because the
species in question do not represent independent realiza-

tions of the same general stochastic process. Rather, the
genomes are related by the phylogeny shown in Figure
2[48,49]. To control for this common ancestry, we performed phylogenetically independent contrasts for gene
family size distributions for the six species pairs indicated
in Figure 2, applying the same likelihood ratio test
described above. We find evidence for larger gene families
in phytopathogenic species for two paired-species comparisons (N. crassa versus M. grisea and T. reesei versus F.
graminearum; P â¤ 10-5), while the other comparisons
either showed either the opposite trend (A. nidulans versus
S. nodorum and P. chrysosporium versus U. maydis; P < 10-9)
or no significant differences (A. flavus versus A. oryzae and
A. fumigatus versus A. nidulans; P > 0.01). In all cases, we
used a significance threshold of Î± = 0.008, which reflects
application of a Bonferroni correction for 6 hypothesis
tests. Note that a maximum likelihood fit of another
potential distribution describing the probability of
observing a gene family of size x in a genome, the exponential distribution, visually provides a rather poorer
explanation of these data (see Additional File 1).
Functional distribution of gene duplicates in pathogens
versus non-pathogens
To elucidate potential functional differences in duplicated
genes in pathogenic versus non-pathogenic genomes, we
compared the distribution of GO terms between the two
groups. We initially selected twenty-two different GO
terms (Figure 3) representing functional categories that
are relevant to fungal pathogenesis, as well as others
related to basal metabolic processes. We compared the

proportions of gene duplicates associated with a GO term
for pathogens and non-pathogens.
When all eleven taxa were considered, two GO terms differed significantly in the number of gene duplicates
observed for pathogens versus non-pathogens, after allowing for a 20% false discovery rate (FDR, see Methods). The
"receptor activity" and "hydrolase activity" terms showed
significantly greater numbers of gene duplicates in pathogenic species than in non-pathogenic lineages. When the
same analysis was repeated for the nine euascomycete
genomes, we identified three additional functional categories where pathogenic species had a greater than
expected number of gene duplicates: "nucleic acid binding," "carbohydrate binding" and "regulation of transcription."
We also compared the number of gene duplicates associated with terms in the Generic GO Slim Ontology for
pathogens and non-pathogens. This survey revealed no
significant distinctions among pathogens versus non-pathogens for all taxa. When only euascomycete species were
considered, we found that gene duplicates associated with
following six terms were over represented among pathogens, again controlling for an FDR of 20%: "hydrolase
activity," "extracellular region," "carbohydrate metabolism," "nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic
acid metabolism," "carbohydrate binding" and "catalytic
activity" (Table 2).

Figure 2
Independent phylogenetic contrasts for pathogens and their closest non-pathogenic relatives
Independent phylogenetic contrasts for pathogens and their closest non-pathogenic relatives. Recent phylogenomics studies support relationships presented here [48, 49]. The distribution of gene family sizes in each genome is assumed
to follow a power law, and the data fit to this distribution by maximum likelihood. Family size versus frequency data shown here
are plotted on log-log-scales. Likelihood ratio tests were used to determine if pathogens (blue text) had larger gene families
(blue shading), smaller gene families (red shading) or no significant difference in the distribution of gene family sizes distribution
(grey shading), as compared to their closest non-pathogenic (red text) relative. P-values indicate the significance of these tests
(with the null hypothesis that the power law coefficient, a, is the same for the pathogenic and the non-pathogenic species in
each paired comparison). Values for the differences in the log likelihoods (i.e., 2ÎlnL) used to infer P-values are also given.

Functional distribution of gene duplicates in species pairs
For the four species pairs that showed global differences in
the magnitude of gene duplication (Figure 2), we surveyed the functional distribution of gene duplicates using
the Generic GO Slim Ontology.

The rice blast fungus, M. grisea, showed higher average
gene family size than its non-pathogenic relative N. crassa
(Figure 2). Correspondingly, we found four GO terms that
are overrepresented in pathogenic M. grisea, as compared
to exclusively saprophytic N. crassa (Table 3). Further,

while pathogenic F. graminearum had larger gene families
than did non-pathogenic T. reesei (Figure 2), we found
five overrepresented GO terms in F. graminearum and an
equal number of overrepresented terms in T. reesei (Tables
3 and 4). When we compared the species pairs where the
non-pathogenic taxon possessed more gene duplicates
globally, (A. nidulans versus S. nodorum and P. chrysosporium versus U. maydis), we found significantly more gene
duplicates associated with a total of eighteen particular
GO terms in the A. nidulans-S. nodorum test pair, and fourteen terms in P. chrysosporium (versus U. maydis), respec-

species comparisons were determined after applying corrections for multiple tests, as above.

Expansion or contraction of gene families in pathogens
To determine whether a given gene family showed significant expansion or contraction, we employed a binomial
test (see Methods). Sixteen gene families show significant
expansion in pathogens, while five gene families appear

carbohydrate metabolism (see Additional file 2). Examples of expanded gene families in the hydrolytic functional class included those with predicted chitin
deactylase, cutinase, amino peptidase and feruloyl esterase activities, among others. Specific examples of
expanded gene families that belong to the oxidoreductase
functional class included those with predicted galactose
oxidase and tyrosinase activities. The transporter functional class of expanded gene families included instances
of sugar porters, malic acid transporters, neutral amino
acid permeases and L-fucose permeases, among others.
For gene families that were deemed significantly contracted, the main functional categories, as indicated by
GO and GenBank annotations, also include hydrolases,
oxidases and transporters. However, the specific biological roles of particular gene families that showed contraction in pathogens differ from those that showed
significant expansion (see Additional files 2 and 3). For
instance, in the oxidoreductase functional class, homologues of ordA (O-methylsterigmatocystin reductase)
appear to be depleted in pathogens. In aflatoxin-producing species of Aspergillus, this gene catalyzes the last reaction in the biosynthesis of this secondary metabolite
[31,50,51]. Other interesting examples include gene families that were predicted to be components of the vaculolar ATPase complex, in addition to those encoding
glucose oxidase precursors (see Additional file 3).
Expanded gene families in species that have more
duplicated genes
For the four cases where phylogenetic contrast analyses
indicated significant differences in gene family sizes in
paired species comparisons (Figure 2), gene family expan-

sion was also examined using an approach similar to that
above (see Methods).
Five gene families are significantly expanded in M. grisea,
relative to non-pathogenic N. crassa. These gene familiesinclude those predicted to have oxidoreductase, transporter, peroxidase and melanin biosynthesis functions
(see Additional file 3). Four gene families are significantly
expanded in F. graminearum versus T. reesei, including
those predicted to have transporter, endoglucanase and
methyl transferase activities (see Additional file 4). Interestingly, the significantly expanded gene family with
methyl transferase functional attributes has substantial
homology to LaeA, a gene that may play a global regulatory role in secondary metabolism in Aspergillus species
[51,52]. There are two significantly expanded gene families in A. nidulans, relative to S. nodorum (see Additional
file 4). One family is predicted to have phosphorylase
activity, while the other encodes genes with ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) transporter function (see Additional file 4).
P. chrysosporium has eight significantly expanded gene
families, relative to pathogenic U. maydis. These eight families include genes with predicted oxidoreductase and
peptidase functions, as well as genes with roles in carbohydrate metabolism (see Additional file 4).

Discussion
Change in gene inventory and fungal genome evolution
Differential gene gain and loss clearly play definitive roles
in both degree of virulence, and in determining host range
[2,5-8,34,53,54]. Although there are numerous examples
of gene family expansion in pathogenic lineages of fungi
[10,22,24,26,29,31,38,53], to date, gene duplication
trends across whole genomes have not been analyzed.

Our analysis sought to understand whether the sum of
gene family expansions have given rise to an overall
increase in numbers of gene duplicates in the genomes of
pathogenic fungi. We observed no such trend when all
pathogenic species were compared to the non-pathogens,
nor when we performed phylogenetically-informed
paired species comparisons. Instead, the paired-species
comparisons showed no clear association between gene
family size distributions and pathogenicity. An example
of this lack of association is apparent in the Aspergillus species comparisons, where we found no significant differences in gene family size distributions, a result that derives
from both the opportunistic nature of the pathogens, as
well as the close phylogenetic relationships of the species
in question [16,17,37,40]. Another potential explanation
for similarity among the complement of gene duplicates
in genomes of the Aspergilli is the recent suggestion that
host animals, and humans in particular, do not generate
the sort of co-evolutionary arms-race characteristic of the
plant hosts of the other pathogenic species considered
[55].
A confounding factor for our analyses is that gene duplication's ability to drive biological innovation is diminished in some fungi by the process of repeat-induced
point mutation [9,56-59]. RIP is a pre-meiotic homologybased mechanism that introduces characteristic point
mutations into sequences present in multiple copies in a
genome, and may have evolved to limit the deleterious
effects of mobile genetic elements [56]. All euascomycete
genomes surveyed here likely possess some degree of RIP
[9-12,15,36,56-58]. However, the severity and efficiency
of the process varies, with N. crassa possibly possessing
the most stringent form [56]. We note that N. crassa shows
the smallest average gene family size among the species
studied, as would be expected, given RIP's severe pruning
of duplicates in this organism. There is no evidence for
RIP in either of the basidiomycete genomes examined in
this study, although it has recently been documented in
anther smut [18,60,61]. Some of the differences illustrated in Figure 2 (particularly the differences between M.
grisea and N. crassa) are possibly due to variation in RIP
stringency rather than pathogenicity.
Although quite variable, the approximate divergence
times among the six pathogenic and five non-pathogenic
species examined are reasonable for large-scale comparative studies of gene duplication in euascomycete and
basidiomycete lineages [36,62,63].
Functional patterns of duplicate gene enrichment in fungal
genomes
Enrichment of gene duplicates over particular functional
categories in the set of twenty-two GO terms, as well as
those in the Generic GO Slim Ontology appear consistent

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/147

with requirements of pathogenic lifestyles [26,64-67].
These results parallel those of previous studies, which
have demonstrated that fungal pathogenesis is associated
with increased catalytic potential among enzymes such as
hydrolases, relatively larger repertoires of receptors, and
the expansion of secreted proteins, as well as carbohydrate
recognition
and
binding
gene
families
[10,11,18,25,26,29,67].
For example, we found an increased number of duplicates
associated with transport functions in F. graminearum, the
causal agent of head blight in cereals, as compared to nonpathogenic T. reesei (Tables 3 and 4), a result consistent
with the known relative deficit of carbohydrate catalysis
genes in T. reesei [12].
Some of the differences observed between non-pathogenic P. chrysosporium and the hemibiotrophic corn smut
fungus U. maydis appear relevant to the markedly divergent ecology and development these basidiomycete species [18,60]. The over-represented terms "carbohydrate
binding," "extracellular region," "response to abiotic stimulus," "multicellular organismal development," "peptidase activity," as well as "amino acid and derivative
metabolic process" are associated with the suite of traits
that make the white rot fungus, P. chrysosporium, amenable to industrial applications, such as lignocellulose and
organopollutant degradation (Table 3). Moreover, the
observed enrichment of gene duplicates dedicated to particular developmental programs, such as muticellularity,
is also consistent with the differences in morphological
complexity between these two organisms in their fruiting
body structures; U. maydis produces no fruiting body, per
se, only teliospore-filled tumors on a host, whereas P.
chrysosporium possesses a resupinate fleshy fruiting body.
That U. maydis showed no enrichment for gene duplicates
for any GO term was consistent with recent analyses of
this genome, which indicated relatively few duplicates
[18].
When phylogenetic relationships are not considered, a
cohort of GO terms that is common to pathogens and
non-pathogens in all four paired-species comparisons
becomes evident (see Table 3). These three terms are: electron transport, generation of precursor metabolites and
energy, as well as catalytic activity. Biological explanations
for this observation include two possibilities that are not
mutually exclusive: first, that genes associated with these
three terms are not peculiar to pathogenesis, and/or secondly, that genes associated with these terms possess
inherently greater plasticity in copy number in fungal
genomes. Given numerous accounts of duplication in
pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungi, copy number plasticity in certain functional categories would seem the
more plausible explanation.

Our results, both from comparisons across all taxa, as well
as paired species comparisons, suggest an association
between organisms' lytic potential ("hydrolytic activity")
and receptor ("receptor activity") repertoires and pathogenesis (Figure 3; Tables 2 and 3). Moreover, even when a
pathogen had fewer gene duplicates overall (A. nidulans
versus S. nodorum), enrichment of terms associated with
lytic activities ("peptidase activity," "catabolic process"),
management of oxygen toxicity ("antioxidant activity"),
as well as terms possibly relevant to protein secretion
("extracellular region") were still evident in the pathogenic lineage (Table 3).
Gene family expansion or contraction in pathogens
Gene families that were expanded in pathogens largely fall
into two functional categories: those encoding lytic
enzymes and those encoding putative transporters (see
Additional file 2). Lytic enzymes, such as feruloyl esterases, cutinases, aminopeptidases and endoglucanases are
known to be significant in successful plant parasitism
interactions, as such genes have demonstrated roles in
plant cell wall decomposition [26,30,64]. Serine proteinases and the regulatory P domain of the subtilisin-like
proprotein convertases have been implicated in mutualistic, as well as pathogenic, interactions with grasses
[26,68,69]. Moreover, the importance of fungal chitin
deactylases in entomopathology has been empirically
demonstrated [70]. Expanded families that were predicted
to have diverse transporter functions included genes that
encode L-fucose and neutral amino acid permeases, as
well as MFS, malic acid and sugar transporters, respectively (see Additional file 2). L-fucose permeases have not
only been implicated in galactose transport and sphigolipid metabolism, but also in development of resistant sclerotia in A. flavus, while neutral amino acid permeases and
MFS transporters are possibly involved in efflux of nonribosomal peptides and other secondary metabolites
required for virulence [71,72]. Permeases may also be critical for the initial assault upon a host, as well as assimilation of host-derived carbohydrates [73,74]. The
remaining expanded families included those encoding
tyrosinases, galatose oxidase precursors and transmembrane receptors, all of which have been implicated in
pathogenic life styles [26,66,75]. Tyrosinases catalyze initial steps in melanin biosynthesis [76]. Melanization in
fungi is frequently, if not always, essential for virulence
[26,65,66]. It is notable that another gene in the melanin
synthesis pathway was also found to be over duplicated in
M. grisea, relative to non-pathogenic N. crassa [77]. Galactose oxidation yields peroxide [78], a reactive oxygen species known to be produced by fungal pathogens during
infection [19,79]. Recent work in M. grisea described a
phalanx of receptors that are linked to pathogenesis and
host perception [29].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/147

The five families that showed gene losses in pathogens
included those with predicted roles in secondary metabolism (see Additional file 3). One intriguing case is that of
O-methylsterigmatocystin oxidoreductase, which catalyzes the last step in aflatoxin biosynthesis. While only a
few species of Aspergillus are known to produce aflatoxin,
numerous euascomycete and basidiomycete lineages possess homologues of this gene, as well as others in the aflatoxin biosynthesis pathway [32,51]. The wide
phylogenetic distribution of these genes suggests not only
that that these genes are ancient, but also that they are
possibly important in secondary metabolism. We speculate that contraction of this family in pathogenic lineages
may be the result of random gene deletions after relaxation of selective pressure that maintains production of this
toxin [31,32,80,81]. Recent genomic and population
studies that focused on the aflatoxin biosynthesis cluster
in species of Aspergillus would seem to support this conjecture, as ordA, an O-methylsterigmatocystin oxidoreductase, appears to have undergone more extensive loss
following duplication than any other gene in the cluster
[22,31].
Gene family expansion in species pairs
Gene families that were expanded in two paired-species
comparisons also had either expected or previously demonstrated roles in virulence, host-pathogen interaction or
chemical defense [22,26,66,67]. For example, homologues of laeA, a methyltransferase, are over duplicated in
F. graminearum. This gene appears to be a global regulator
of secondary metabolism in species of Aspergillus [51,52].
It is interesting to speculate whether an expanded repertoire of upstream regulators of secondary metabolism in
F. graminearum could reflect either greater numbers of target genes or refined regulatory control of secondary metabolic networks in this primary pathogen (see Additional
file 4). In the second instance where a phytopathogen had
overall greater levels of gene duplication, five gene families were expanded. Gene families encoding diverse cytochrome P450s, MFS transporters, as well as those
predicted to have trihydroxynaphthalene reductase activity were expanded in M. grisea, as compared to exclusively
saprophytic N. crassa (Figure 2; see Additional file 4).

The white rot fungus P. chrysosporium had eight gene families that were significantly expanded, relative to basal
basidiomycete U. maydis (see Additional file 4). These
eight expanded families encode genes that have diverse
oxidoreductase activities, protease and endo-1, 3 (4)-betaglucanase functions, consistent with genes previously
reported to be present in high copy numbers in this
genome [60]. A large complement of such genes in this
organism's genome is likely a reflection of its saprotropic
wood-decay ecology.

Conclusion
Here, we present results on patterns of gene duplication
and differential gene gain and loss in pathogenic fungal
genomes. The scope of this study captures at least of one
billion years of fungal evolution [62]. No general relationship between pathogenicity and the magnitude of gene
duplication was evident, but differences in duplicate gene
retention among certain functional classes were consistent
with known and predicted requirements of virulent lifestyles [26,66,67,75]. Gene family expansion in species
with overall higher levels of duplication also showed
functional trends that could be reconciled with organismal life histories [9-12,15,18,36,37,55,60,66,75]. The
observed differences in overall levels of duplication
between phytopathogenic lineages and their non-pathogenic relatives implicate gene inventory flux as an important virulence-associated process in fungi.

Methods
Identifying gene duplicates within and among fully
sequenced genomes
Gene duplicates in nine euascomycte genomes, and two
basidiomycete genomes (Table 1) were identified using a
customized version of GenomeHistory (GH), which was
parallelized for implementation in a high performance
computing environment [82]. Each of these genomes is
publicly available [83-86]. Our GH analyses required that
candidate duplicate genes have at least 40% amino acid
identity and a BLAST-based significance threshold of E â¤
10-8.
Forming sequence homology-based single linkage
clustering gene families
Candidate gene duplicates obtained in the above GH
analyses that had BLAST hits with query and subject coverage of at least 40%, a minimum percent identity of 25%
and significance threshold of E â¤ -3 to Repbase V11.05
sequences were excluded from further analysis [87,88].
Homology-based single linkage clustering (SLC) gene
families were formed using standard graph theoretic
approaches and network graphing algorithms within the
GT Miner software package [89-91]. Our approach
required that a gene family have at least two members.
Candidate gene duplicate pairs obtained in the above GH
analyses were also filtered using minimum coverage
thresholds, where query and subject sequences were
required to show at least 70% coverage, prior to forming
single-linkage clustering gene families. Single linkage
gene families were computed across all eleven genomes
(Figure 1).
Distribution of gene family sizes in pathogenic species
verses non-pathogenic species
To assess the relative likelihood of observing gene families
of a given size in pathogenic and non-pathogenic species,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/147

we compared the distribution of gene family sizes across
eleven genomes. This comparison assumes that the probability of observing a gene family with n members is given
by:

P=

n âa
â âa
â i
i =1

For this distribution, the value of a can be thought of as
the "rate of decay" of gene family sizes: large values of a
indicate proportionally more small gene families. Thus,
we can thus compare values of a between genomes to test
for genome-scale differences in duplication propensities.
Given the observed distribution of family sizes in each
genome, we used numerical optimization to find the
value of a that gives the maximum likelihood of observing
these gene family sizes [92]. We first compared the overall
distribution of gene families in pathogens to that in the
non-pathogens. We separately fit these two sets of gene
families to the above distribution by maximum likelihood and retained the ln-likelihood of each dataset
(lnL_P and lnL_NP). We then created a pooled dataset
containing all gene families from both the pathogens and
non-pathogens and calculated the likelihood of that
pooled dataset (lnL_A). This pooled analysis is a special
case of the previous analyses, where the pathogens and
non-pathogens are required to have the same value of a
(i.e., required to have the same gene family size distributions). To test the hypothesis of equal values of a between
the datasets, we compared twice the difference in log-likelihood between the pooled model and the sum of the
other two likelihoods (i.e., 2Îln L = 2((ln L_P + ln L_NP)
- ln L_A)). Under the null hypothesis of no difference
between the pathogens and non-pathogens, 2ÎlnL will
follow a chi-square distribution, with one degree of freedom [93]. Cases where the P-values from these tests were
small (<0.05) indicated significant differences in duplication propensities in the genomes being compared. We
employed an identical procedure for testing for significant
differences among individual pairs of genomes.
GeneOntology-based functional annotation
Gene Ontology (GO) terms were associated with genes in
gene families using the 2006 version of the GO Consortium's database [94,95]. All genes in gene families were
queried against proteins extracted from the GO database
using BLAST, with cutoff values for significance at E â¤ 108, query and subject coverage of at least 40% and percent
amino acid identity of at least 25%. For each such hit, all
GO terms associated with the database sequence were
transferred to a given fungal gene. In sum, of 125, 902
genes that were queried against the GO database, a total
of 75, 511 were associated with GO terms.

Functional distribution of gene duplicates
We compared the number of gene duplicates across
twenty-two higher-level GO terms. For each GO term, we
performed a chi squared test of the null hypothesis that
the proportion of gene duplicates associated with that
term was the same for both pathogens and non-pathogens
[82,96]. We also compared the number of gene duplicates
associated with individual GO terms in the Generic GO
Slim ontology [97] in pathogenic versus non-pathogenic
genomes. Here, as in the above, we tested whether the
proportions of genes duplicates associated with a particular GO Slim term in pathogens versus non-pathogens were
similar. To correct for the multiple hypothesis tests problems inherent to this approach, we judged results to be
significant allowing a maximum false discovery rate
(FDR) of 20% [96,98]. These two analyses were performed on all eleven genomes, on the nine euascomycete
genomes and on the four pairs of genomes that showed
differences in the overall distributions of gene duplicates
(see above and Figure 2).
Characterizing expansion and contraction of gene families
In the 500 largest gene families in our analyses, we tested
for significant expansion or contraction in pathogenic
genomes using a binomial test. Thus, for the global families, we calculated the proportion p (= 0.528) of all genes
across all genomes in gene families of size two or greater
that were observed in pathogenic species. This value was
then used as the binomial parameter in the above test.

We also searched for significantly expanded families in
the four instances where differences in gene family size
distributions for pairs of genomes were evident (described
above). To test for significance in these cases, a binomial
test was again employed. For a given gene family, we compared the observed gene count for the lineage showing an
overall greater magnitude of gene duplication (Figure 2)
to the number genes contributed by the related species. In
this context, the binomial parameter was p = 0.5. No
attempt to account for differing genomes sizes was made
in this analysis because the phylogenetic control makes it
clear that any differences in genome size necessarily arose
after the species pair in question shared a common ancestor.
GenBank annotation for expanded and contracted gene
families
We also performed BLAST searches for all expanded and
contracted gene families against the GenBank non-redundant (nr) database [99]. Only sequences with BLAST Evalues less than 10-8, which had at least 25% identity
between subject and query, where the local alignment
spanned at least 40% of the query sequence, and that were
not annotated as "hypothetical protein" or "predicted
protein" were retained.
