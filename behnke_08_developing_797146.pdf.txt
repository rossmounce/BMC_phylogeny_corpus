Abstract
Intestinal helminth infections of livestock and humans are predominantly controlled by treatment
with three classes of synthetic drugs, but some livestock nematodes have now developed resistance
to all three classes and there are signs that human hookworms are becoming less responsive to the
two classes (benzimidazoles and the nicotinic acetylcholine agonists) that are licensed for treatment
of humans. New anthelmintics are urgently needed, and whilst development of new synthetic drugs
is ongoing, it is slow and there are no signs yet that novel compounds operating through different
modes of action, will be available on the market in the current decade. The development of
naturally-occurring compounds as medicines for human use and for treatment of animals is fraught
with problems. In this paper we review the current status of cysteine proteinases from fruits and
protective plant latices as novel anthelmintics, we consider some of the problems inherent in taking
laboratory findings and those derived from folk-medicine to the market and we suggest that there
is a wealth of new compounds still to be discovered that could be harvested to benefit humans and
livestock.

Introduction
Intestinal nematodes are extremely important pathogens
of domestic livestock, especially of sheep, goats and cattle.
Collectively, they are responsible for severe losses to livestock agriculture throughout the world. It has been calculated that, in the U.K., intestinal worms constitute the
most important disease-related cost of farming sheep,
being responsible for an estimated annual loss to the
industry of £83 million [1]. In developing countries of the
world, intestinal worm infections are perceived to be the
single most important threat to economic success, as was
made dramatically clear in a recent review of the attitudes
and concerns of small holder farmers in Africa [2].

Intestinal nematodes are also important pathogens of
humans, with a range of pathologies and consequences
for human health [3]. Four species dominate: Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and the two hookworms Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus. Global
estimates of disability adjusted life years lost to infection
are almost 5 million with some 3 billion people around
the world believed to carry some of the species involved
[3,4].

Synthetic anthelmintics and resistance
The treatment of intestinal nematode infections in the 21st
century is largely through the use of modern synthetic

anthelmintics. Three classes of these anthelmintics dominate the market, each mediating its effect through a different mode of action on the target nematodes. The group 1
anthelmintics include the benzimidazoles and these were
introduced in the early 1960s for use in livestock but
resistance (in this case to thiabendazole) was detected
after only 4 years of usage in the U.S.A. The group 2
anthelmintics, the nicotinic acetylcholine agonists such as
pyrantel, levamisole, morantel etc., were introduced in
the early 1970s and resistance was detected for the first
time in 1977 in Australia. The macrocyclic lactones (e.g.
ivermectin), which form the group 3 anthelmintics, were
first licensed for use in the early 1980s and resistance
became apparent again within seven years and was first
reported in S. Africa [5].
Since then, resistance has spread around the globe, particularly in species affecting sheep, but it is also a significant
problem in the husbandry of horses, especially with
respect to the cyathostomins [5-7], and is an increasing
problem in cattle and pigs [8,9]. Of particular concern is
the discovery of triple resistant nematodes which cannot
be easily controlled by any of the three classes of drugs.
This was first detected in S. Africa in sheep, and then in
Scotland among Angora goat flocks [10], but is now
known to be more widely distributed [11].
There are also some indications that human hookworms,
notably Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale are
becoming less sensitive to the benzimidazoles and to pyrantel, respectively [12-14]. Studies in communities in
Tanzania have shown that the efficacy of mebendazole
has declined significantly in areas where mebendazole
was given routinely to school aged children in a national
program to reduce GI nematode infections in the population and to give the children a good start in life [15,16].
Currently, there are a number of new programs being
implemented in developing countries based on mass
treatment of populations with ivermectin or praziquantel,
each combined either with mebendazole or albendazole,
and these have already made a significant impact on the
prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in these
regions [17-19]. Nevertheless, veterinary parasitologists
have repeatedly warned those working in the medical profession that where mass delivery of anthelmintics is being
implemented, the lessons from the veterinary experience
should be taken on board by the medical profession and,
if we are to preserve the efficacy of the available drugs into
the future, appropriate actions should be taken before it is
too late [20,21].
Although there are signs that novel synthetic drugs are
being developed (e.g. nitazoxanide, cyclic depsipeptides,
octadepsipeptides such as emodepside, tribendimidine,
diketopiperazines such as paraherquamides, amino-ace-

tonitrile derivatives {AADs}), no new drugs that operate
through a different mode of action to the Class 1, 2 and 3
anthelmintics have become available on the market for
the treatment of either livestock or humans [22-26]. However, there is an exception for companion animals because
emodepsides (a product of fungi associated with the
leaves of Camellia japonica) are being marketed already for
treatment of worms in cats (Bayer Health Care under the
trade name Profender). Nevertheless, it is now 28 years
since the avermectins appeared, and we are still largely
constrained by having to rely on just three classes of
anthelmintics, so despite the promise of new agents in the
pipeline, the range of effective agents is extremely limited
and there is a pressing need for new/additional solutions
to the problem of controlling intestinal worm infections.
The obvious route to follow is to develop novel synthetic
drugs. In this context, it may be that as yet undeclared
alternative drugs have been developed already by pharmaceutical companies but assessed as uncompetitive in the
current market in the face of the overwhelming success of
the macrocylic lactones. It is possible that some such
drugs are being kept in the wings until they have a likelihood of success, and can take centre stage, when the current agents become totally redundant. Whatever the
explanation for the lack of overt progress on this front,
whether through failure to develop novel compounds or
failure to develop commercially competitive agents, the
lack of new drugs over the last 28 years indicates that it is
not easy in this day and age to develop novel drugs with a
different mode of action from those already on the market.

Medicinal plants and the problems of developing
their active principles as novel medicines
An alternative is to exploit naturally-occurring compounds that exist in plants and trees and in their seeds and
fruits. Medicinal plants and fruits have been used by
indigenous peoples for centuries as sources of extracts
used in the treatment of a variety of problems, including
infectious diseases and those caused by parasites, in livestock and humans [27-29]. These are often referred to as
ethno-veterinary or ethno-medical remedies, and, in general, they are shunned by traditional, conventional western medicine.
There have been considerable efforts to identify the active
ingredients and indeed some are well known [30-32], but,
to a large extent, few have lived up to their expectations
when tested rigorously [33], and even fewer have been
found to have curative properties that can compete effectively with synthetic drugs [27]. Nevertheless, some exceptional natural products, have become widely accepted.
Quinine for the treatment of malaria is an obvious example, as is artemisinin or quinghaosu from Artemisia annula
[30,34]. Penicillin is a fungal product and indeed ivermec-

tin itself is a bacterial product, being derived from the soil
bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis [35]. Among plant
derived molecules that have anti-parasitic activity and
have been used as veterinary parasiticides at times there
are nicotine, pyrethrum and rotenone. The former two
provided templates for the development of synthetic
mimics which include the pyrantel group for nematodes
and synthetic insecticides, respectively. However, to our
knowledge, there are no naturally-derived plant products
sold commercially in the markets of the developed
nations of the world for the treatment of worm infections
[31].
If natural plant products are to be exploited in the future
as medicines for human use or for the treatment of livestock, then isolation and characterisation of their active
principles becomes an essential prerequisite to further
progress. Problems which follow include development of
methods for their stabilisation, preservation, formulation,
delivery etc., and all this requires enormous development
costs and many years of patient work. Furthermore, the
necessary clinical trials of efficacy (randomised, doubleblind, placebo-controlled) and essential safety trials add,
to the delay before drugs become available for treatment,
and enormously to the costs sustained by developers.
Inherent in the system is the accompanying bureaucracy
required by authorities to licence novel drugs for commercial production and this adds yet another tier of complexity, expense and delay.
Perhaps the most important impediment to further
progress is the obstacle presented by "prior art". Although
contemporary laboratory techniques may help to identify
the active compounds and solve some of the initial problems referred to above, the ultimate developmental costs
are dependent on investment by industry. But pharmaceutical firms are not charities. Their priority is to ensure good
returns on their outlay, for reinvestment in research and
for their shareholders; profits usually facilitated by patents
protecting the key steps involved in extraction or manufacture of the active principles. For many medicinal
plants, there is already too much published information
in the public domain to enable compounds to be patented securely, although if structure has not been disclosed, patenting is possible. Moreover, it is very clear to
us that there is a conflict between disclosure as part of academic research (publish or die!) and secrecy to ensure patentability in the longer term. These are real obstacles to
investment by industry, and an anomaly of the system
that is hindering progress in a world where novel drugs are
urgently required. It is also a sad reflection of our priorities since it is very clear that there are active compounds
that could be developed into new generations of modern
medicines. If we are to make progress, trusts and public
funds will need to support the initial sequence of develop-

mental steps, possibly right through to the marketable
product and at least some such schemes have already been
initiated (e.g. Wellcome Trust Translational Awards
Scheme). By way of encouragement, it is worth pointing
out that in developing formulations and delivery systems,
it is conceivable that novel steps will be discovered and
these will allow patents to be filed eventually and industry
to be guaranteed protection.
There are of course other problems that deter pharmaceutical companies from exploiting plant derived medicines.
These include variability in the concentration of active
principles in relation to how the plants were grown, climate, soil quality, site, and season of the year. Additionally governments may charge fees to access sources of
relevant plants, and royalties for their exploitation, and
these charges may eat into profits, discouraging investment and development.
An alternative avenue might be to develop natural products as food additives. Concerns about residues in food
and animal welfare under intensive stocking densities
have stimulated a growing market in the developed world
for organic farming, and organically farmed livestock are
as susceptible to parasites, perhaps even more so than
those intensively reared and regularly drenched with
wormers. Whole plants, leaves, stems, fruits and seeds
containing activity against worms could be incorporated
into feed without loss of organic status. This would be
more acceptable where the whole plant is itself a suitable
food for the target animals, as in the case of fruits, but perhaps less so where the only benefit of eating would be
from the medicinal principles, since plants, like all biological material, are extremely complex and may contain
thousands of molecules, only some of which would bring
benefits while others may be toxic. A good example of the
use of fodder that does not support transmission of intestinal worms is in chicory on organic sheep farms [36], or
plants with high tannin content [37]. More refined methods of administration may include extracts from plant tissues, given on their own or in combination with
conventional fodder.
Indeed, this whole approach may spawn a novel industry,
searching for novel plant varieties with up-regulated content of the active principles. In this age of genetic manipulation, transgenic approaches may also pay dividends
[32], but, of course, these would risk opening another
field of controversy: the reluctance of many consumers to
accept transgenic plants as viable alternatives to those
developed through conventional breeding programs
[38,39].
If natural plant products are to have a future in veterinary
or human medicine, they must be developed to a stage

Parasites & Vectors 2008, 1:29

where consistency of their effects can be assured, and rigorous quality control methods can be implemented. For
this, knowledge of the active principles is essential, and
specific in vitro-based assays that reflect accurately their
anti-worm potential need to be available. Minimal side
effects on either health or production traits are obvious
requirements of any such products if they are to compete
effectively with available drugs on the market.

Medicinal fruits containing cysteine proteinases
Some of the earliest known medicinal anthelmintic plants
include papaya (Carica papaya), figs (Ficus spp.) and pineapple (Ananas comosus). Anecdotal reports of their usage
for the treatment of worm infections by the native inhabitants of Panama and South America stretch back to over
a century ago [40]. Their extracts were shown to be highly
effective in clearing the most obstinate of human intestinal worms, Trichuris trichiura, in the 1920s [41] and more
effectively than any of the current synthetic drugs [42].
Indeed, European doctors used papain and papaya latex
for the treatment of worms in the 19th century [[43,44]
and see later in this review] but, it was not until the 1930s
that they were shown to be actually capable of digesting
nematodes [40] and their enzymic basis was discovered
[45]. The active principles are now known to be cysteine
proteinases (CP) that occur naturally in various parts of
the plant, and Table 1 summarises some of those known
to be contained within plants. For example, in pineapples,
different combinations of enzymes occur in the stem, and
in the fruit. The latex of both papaya and figs contains
CPs.
These plant-derived CPs probably evolved primarily to
defend plants against insect pests [46] but possibly also
against plant parasitic nematodes, against which they are
likewise highly effective [47,48]. Among the other important roles of CPs are facilitating the coagulation of latex
during the sealing of wounds on plants, leaf senescence
and possibly also in the ripening process [49-51].

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/1/1/29

Molecular characteristics of cysteine proteinases
and their target proteins
The CPs are phylogenetically classified into 9 clans which
show no evolutionary relationship between them, suggesting that the ability to utilise the thiolate anion of a
cysteine residue as the nucleophile in peptide bond
hydrolysis may have arisen independently on nine occasions. Fifty eight families of CPs are organised within
these clans, and the CPs that have been shown to be
anthelmintic are in Family C1, the papain family, in Clan
CA [52,53]. Much is known about how these enzymes
exert their activity. They have an active site groove into
which the target polypetides bind. Lying across the groove
are the active site cysteine and histidine residues, both crucial to the process of hydrolysis of the target polypeptide.
The amino acid residues lining the groove determine
which peptide bonds in a protein are susceptible to
hydrolysis, by complementary binding with the substrate
amino acid side-chains.
One important property of CPs is that their activity can be
easily quantified. As was emphasized earlier, a useful
property of any naturally occurring anthelmintic is to
have an assay of its activity that is independent of the in
vivo efficacy but correlates well with it. In the case of CPs,
the specific inhibitor E-64 can be used to measure the
operational molar concentration of enzyme activity in any
preparation. For this assay, convenient substrates are also
required and, for many of the enzymes, amide substrates
with coloured or fluorimetric leaving groups can be used,
such as, for papain, chymopapain and crude papaya latex,
benzoyl-(D, L)-arginine-p-nitroanilide (Bz-Arg-pNA). On
digestion, the nitroaniline group is released, which can be
accurately quantified with the use of a spectrophotometer.
For F. carica & F. benjamina latex, ficin, pineapple juice,
kiwi fruit extract and Asclepias sinaica latex, a useful substrate
is
benzyloxycarbonyl-phenylalanyl-arginyl-pnitroanilide (Z-Phe-Arg-pNA), and for stem bromelain, it
is benzyloxycarbonyl-arginyl-arginyl-p-nitroanilide (ZArg-Arg-pNA). All these substrates are commercially available.

Parasitic helminths have evolved to occupy virtually every
conceivable niche in the mammalian host. Each species of
intestinal nematode is a specialist to some degree and parasitizes a restricted region of the intestine. Table 2 is not
an exhaustive list, but gives some examples of important
nematode species affecting sheep, cattle, pigs, humans
and rodents. Anthelmintic drugs are clearly likely to have
varying efficacies in different regions of the gut because of
the differences in physiology, including pH, enzyme content, fluid and solid content, etc., and therefore, in evaluating candidate drugs, it is important to assess their
efficacies in laboratory systems with a spectrum of species

that occupy different niches along the entire length of the
intestine. The best suited systems for this approach are
laboratory rodents, and, fortuitously, laboratory rodents
are hosts to a range of relevant parasites, maintained in
different laboratories throughout the world.
Of the rodent species listed in Table 2, Heligmosomoides
bakeri is perhaps the easiest to maintain and to work with.
H. bakeri has changed its name twice in recent times, being
formally known as Nematospiroides dubius, and then H.
polygyrus, but now correctly as H. bakeri [54]. This species
causes chronic infections in the anterior of the small intestine of mice, so there is little concern about loss of parasites through host immunity in the immediate weeks
following a single-pulse infection [55]. With species such
as Trichinella spiralis and Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, which
are expelled within 3 weeks of infection by rats, experimental trials have to be carefully timed to complete observations before worm expulsion through immunity,
otherwise it is not possible to distinguish between worm
loss arising through treatment with a candidate drug and
worm loss through the development of the host-protective immune response.
Many of the most devastating problems in ruminants are
caused by nematodes that live in the abomasum, the
fourth stomach of ruminants, but there are no ideal models of these species in rodents. Recently, a spirurid worm
of wild spiny mice [56] has been isolated and adapted for
passage through laboratory mice [57], and we have used
this species successfully to assess the effects of our candidate anthelmintics in the rodent stomach [58]. Although
it is a member of a phylogenetic group that is not closely
related to the Trichostrongyloidae, it nevertheless lives in
the acid environment of the stomach and presents candidate drugs with similar problems to those encountered in
the abomasum of ruminants.

Trichuris muris

Many different species of nematodes exploit the large
intestines of mammals and, in some hosts, such as horses,
the list is very long indeed, notably the cyathostomins. In
mice, Trichuris muris, which is closely related to the Trichuris spp. that infect humans (T. trichiura), dogs (T. vulpis), pigs (T. suis) and ruminants (T. ovis, T. globulosa), is
an obvious species to exploit in screening programs.

Comparison of the efficacy of different extracts
on parasite motility in vitro
Note all experiments carried out by the authors involving
the use of laboratory animals were approved by the University of Nottingham ethics committee and were carried
out under UK Home Office Licence (Project Licence
number 40/2621).
Most species of nematodes can be kept alive and motile in
simple saline media for short periods of time after
removal from their hosts. As an initial screen, we developed a straightforward motility assay which was simple to
implement and highly reproducible. Worms were placed
in a saline solution kept at 37°C on a laboratory bench
incubator, and their motility was scored on a scale of 0–5,
where a score of 5 represents a highly active motile worm,
4 slightly less active, 3 less active still, 2 lethargic but capable of independent movement, 1 movement only apparent when prodded, and 0 no movement even when
prodded. With H. bakeri and T. muris the motility of
worms kept in control saline declined from the outset but
slowly relative to that of worms exposed to effective
anthelmintic agents. So with these species, assessment of
efficacy was based on the expectation that motility would
decline faster when the worms were exposed to an effective agent. P. muricola, however, is far more robust and
capable of moving vigorously in media for well over 24 h.

Representative results are shown in Fig. 1, where the more
rapid loss of motility of H. bakeri is clearly apparent when
worms were exposed to increasing operational molar concentrations of CP activity. The dataset in Fig. 1B shows
that all three concentrations of papain were highly effective in this case. Experiments such as these allow enzyme
activity from different sources to be compared. Table 3
shows EC50 values extrapolated from these in vitro assays
for plant extracts, and some purified enzymes as well.
Many were extremely effective at micromolar concentrations, but interestingly kiwi fruit extract, containing actinidain, had no effect at all.

ent damage. Fig. 3 shows scanning electron micrographs
of changes in H. bakeri, but similar changes were also seen
in the other species. Most surprisingly, even the tough,
resilient P. muricola could not hold out against the attack
by CPs in vitro [58].
Examination by transmission electron microscopy
showed that soon after exposure, the outermost layer of
the cuticle began to crinkle, and the ridges called crêtes
(longitudinal cuticular ridges without an internal cuticularized supporting element [59]), lost their rigidity,
gained electron dense interiors, and began to shrink (Fig.
4). Eventually, the whole of the architecture normally
seen on the outside of the parasite, constituting its synlophe (a technical term for the whole complex of crêtes that
together comprise the equipment through which the
nematode attaches to host villi [59]), disappeared revealing underlying collagen fibres, and then, at the weakest
point, the internal high hydrostatic pressure within the
pseudocoelomic cavity caused the worms to burst open,
often carrying externally sections of the intestine and
gonads (See Additional file 1). Further incubation invariably resulted in the almost complete digestion of the cuti-

cle of the worms. This sequence was evident on all three
species examined by us, and also on the canine hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum [60]. Although the detail of
our observations, under both scanning and transmission
electron microscopes, on the changes taking place were
original, the fact that parasitic worms dissolve in the presence of extracts from papaya, pineapple and figs is not
itself new. It was first suggested in the late 1870s [61] and
then shown convincingly in the last century, first with
extracts of figs [40] and then pineapples [62] and papain
on Ascaris suum [[63], cited as A. lumbricoides but obtained
from pigs so more likely to be A. suum].
Even more surprisingly, we found that the surface of the
tapeworm Rodentolepis microstoma also showed major
structural changes (Fig. 5), reflected in damage evident at
the scanning microscopical level to the surface of the syncytial external layer of the tegument. These studies on the
effects of CPs on cestodes are still at a very early stage, and,
currently, we have little information on the details of the
process involved. In fact, the anthelmintic properties of
pineapple extract against helminths other than nematodes, was reported as early as 1939 by Berger and Asenjo

cuticle has been lost and detachment of the cuticle from the underlying hypodermis is apparent in places. For TEM preparation
adult specimens of Heligmosomoides bakeri were fixed in glutaraladehyde, postfixed in osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in ethanol
embedded in epoxy resin and sectioned. The sections were stained in lead citrate and uranyl acetate and examined in a Jeol

[62] who found that the porcine acanthocephalan parasite Macracanthorynchus hirundinaceus was dissolved in the
presence of fresh pineapple juice. Later, the same authors
found that papain did not have the same effect against the
acanthocephalan [63]. The observations that CPs actually
damage cestodes, and acanthocepahalans, albeit selectively, raise the possibility that some CPs may have a
wider spectrum of activity than purely against nematodes.
Interestingly, de Amorin et al. [64], failed to detect an in
vivo effect of Ficus latex on Rodentolepis nana in mice. Nevertheless, the idea that there may be common target sites

in proteins in the nematode cuticle and the cestode and
acanthocephalan teguments is intriguing.

Effect of cysteine proteinases on worm burdens
in vivo
The real test of whether CPs have potential for development as novel anthelmintics is the demonstration that
they actually reduce worm burdens in infected animals.
Effect on helminth infections in humans
Indications that papaya latex and papain are actually
active in this respect go back to the early 1800s, when they

were used by physicians in Europe for treatment of nematode infections [29] at a time when there were few alternatives available and the synthetic drugs had not yet been
invented. Among other reports, Fernan-Nunez [65]
reported a centuries-old custom of native people in
Columbia who used the sap of the fig F. laurifolia (known
locally as Leche de Higueron) as a treatment for worm
infections, especially Trichuris trichiura. Two further
reports from this period, that are not based on full publications but are cited by others, include the recovery of up
to 500 expelled T. trichiura from subjects treated with the
sap of F. elastica in Panama by Schapiro [66] and the effective use of "Leche de Higueron" by Hall [67] against
trichiuriasis in Nicaragua. Caldwell & Caldwell [41]
reported successful treatment of patients at the Scarcy
Hospital for the insane at Mt. Vernon, Alabama where
trichiuriasis was extensive, with Higuerolatex. This report
documents faecal egg count reductions of up to 91%, and
averaging 89.5%, exceeding quite markedly the average
efficacy of modern anthelmintics [42] for T. trichiura
infections. Higuerolatex was also found to be effective
against A. lumbricoides, reducing faecal egg counts by
89.7%.
More recently, the commercially available formulation
Vermizym, manufactured in Germany, (based on papain)
was shown to be effective against human pinworm (Enterobius vermicularis) and round worm (Ascaris lumbricoides)
infections in a trial involving 60 subjects, who were apparently completely cleared of worms [68]. Jonxis & Bekins
[43], in Holland, used a preparation called Velardon, also

based on papain, to treat children less than 8 years old for
Ascaris infections. Stransky & Reyes [44], working in the
Philippines, assessed Vermizyn, treating subjects with
three doses at about one and a half hour intervals, each
with a teaspoon of Vermizyn. They reported very high efficacy reflected in reduced faecal egg counts after treatment
and expulsion of adult Ascaris from treated subjects. They
also confirmed that Trichuris infections were markedly
reduced but failed to detect any effect on hookworm
infections. Another trial with the same product showed
that it cured 70% of subjects with whipworm (Trichuris
trichiura) infections [69].
A trial in Amazonia in the 1980s with the latex of F. glabrata (= F. laurifloria?, the ojé tree) indicated strong efficacy against A. lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura, and
even Necator americanus in humans [70], but the study did
not meet contemporary standards for such trials and
lacked the necessary statistical analysis.
Effect on helminth infections in companion animals
There are few reports of the use of CPs to treat companion
animals, but the successful use of the latex from papaya
(at 1.3 ml/kg) to remove worms (most probably Toxocara,
although reported as Ascaris) from dogs in Cairo was
reported by Nagaty et al., [71].
Effect on helminth infections in livestock
Evidence that papaya latex was highly effective against A.
suum in pigs was provided by Satrija et al. [72], but we are
not aware of any other trials in monogastric livestock. To

Effect on helminth infections in experimental rodent trials
Satrija et al [74] provided evidence that papaya latex was
effective in removing H. bakeri from experimentally
infected mice. The dose response reported in this paper
indicated that a single treatment at 8 mg/kg body weight
papaya latex caused an 84.5% reduction in worm burdens.

We gave mice infected with H. bakeri daily treatments of
papaya latex for seven days, and assessed faecal egg counts
(FEC) on three days before treatment and then on four
days after treatment, including the final day when animals
were culled for worm counts [75]. The data in Fig. 6a show
that, soon after treatment with papaya latex commenced,
faecal egg counts of H. bakeri fell, and, by day 25, FEC had
fallen by 97% in the papaya latex-treated animals. When
the animals were autopsied, the reduction in parasite burdens was 92%, although complete loss of worms was not
achieved [75].
Fig. 6b shows that treatment of mice infected with T. muris
also resulted in rapid reduction of FEC, mean values dropping by 98% by day 55 post infection [76]. Worm burdens
fell by 93% relative to the control group treated only with
water. These results demonstrate convincingly that at least
some enzyme activity can survive passage through the
upper intestine and that sufficient amounts are present in
the large intestine to cause the suppression of egg counts
and loss of T. muris. In this respect, it is pertinent that Hale
[77] showed proteolytic activity throughout the alimentary tract and even in the faeces of mice that had been
treated with bromelain, and these observations concur
with our data showing that papaya latex CP activity is
recoverable throughout the intestine of mice in the hours
after treatment, but accumulates particularly in the large
intestine [58]. These experiments provide independent
confirmation of the outcomes of earlier trials in humans,
with worms living in both the small and large intestines
[68-70].
Dose response experiments confirmed that the efficacy of
papaya latex was based on low amounts of CP, with ED50s
in the nanomolar range (Fig. 7). Such low amounts with
the high anti-parasite activity that we observed indicate
that much of the papaya latex is in fact non-active, and
raises the possibility that refinement and concentration of
the active principles will enable a reduction of the volumes and weights of papaya latex that have to be currently
given to animals to cause loss of worms. Satrija et al. [74]

with these values. However, our demonstration that the
active principles are actually present in much smaller concentrations provides the clue that concentration of the
active principles may be a worthwhile avenue for refining
the use of these agents. Our unpublished data indicate
that the active principles are soluble and found in the
supernatant fraction of papaya latex after centrifugation,

encouraging us to believe that further refinement is a feasible option. As with in vitro experiments, we were able to
demonstrate that in vivo activity also depended on the
presence of active CPs, since papaya latex that had been
treated with E-64, had no effect on worm burdens and E64 by itself was also without any effect on worms (Fig. 8),
[75]).
A relevant question to resolve was whether the mode of
action of CPs in papaya latex in vivo was the same as that
evident in vitro. One complication of addressing this question adequately is that as soon as worms are damaged they
are likely to begin moving down the intestine, since they
would become incapable of holding their position against
the flow of ingesta as it is pushed down the intestine by
peristalsis. Thus damaged worms are likely to be detected
outside their normal site in the gut and it could be argued
that the damage was not so much a reflection of the activity of the CPs but rather the consequence of moving into
an abnormal site in the gut. However, our experiments
contained natural controls that helped to dispel this concern. Papaya latex does not clear all the worms out at each
treatment, so some worms remain in their normal anterior site. Indeed we found that 1 hour after treatment,
worms could be detected in the lower intestine, showing
damaged cuticle and signs of erosion of their surface
much like those observed in vitro. Two hours after treat-

Evidence that the in vivo effect of papaya latex on H. bakeri is
mediated through cysteine proteinases. Groups of mice
infected with 200 L3 of H. bakeri were treated with water, E64 alone, papaya latex (135 nmoles active enzyme) or papaya
latex pre-incubated with E-64 (0.64 nM) for 15 minutes prior
to oral delivery to mice. Only untreated papaya latex caused

ment some worms were in the colon with even more substantial damage to their surface, showing complete
erosion of the surface layers of the cuticle and exposure of
the underlying collagen fibers. However, even at 3 and 4
hours after treatment other worms were seen in the upper
small intestine, in their normal site, showing a normal
appearance of the synlophe with an undamaged cuticle.
That, together with our observation that after treatment
with conventional anthelmintics (such as pyrantel, which
paralyses worms), no changes were seen in the cuticle as
the worms were retrieved from the lower intestine, indicate that it is the CP activity, and not translocation into
abnormal sectors of the gut, that is responsible for the
damage to worms in vivo [75].

The special case of worms that parasitize the
stomach
The CPs found in the latices and extracts of fruits all have
a neutral pH optimum of around 7, with a range, for
example in the case of ficin, in which some activity is
retained from pH 4 to 8.5 [40]. Fruit derived, secreted CPs
cannot work effectively at lower or higher pH (although
some intracellular CPs have lower optimal pHs), so we
were not expecting to see an immediate effect on our
model stomach worm P. muricola. It has even been suggested that the effect of acidity on CPs is irreversible [78],
but quite clearly that cannot be the whole story because in
our experiments and the earlier trials with human para-

Page 11 of 18

Parasites & Vectors 2008, 1:29

sitic worms, the anthelmintic activity was convincingly
demonstrated against worms in the small intestine and in
the colon [75,76]. As expected, we initially observed no
effects against P. muricola when the papaya latex was given
orally. However, when acid secretion was temporarily
blocked by giving the antacid cimetidine 30 minutes
before the papaya latex, we observed loss of most female
worms, although surprisingly no effect on males [58].
This curious sex bias may just be a question of the available cuticular surface, since female worms are substantially
larger than males [79], although the surface area/volume
ratio is larger in smaller organisms. It may also reflect
molecular differences in the structural composition of the
cuticles of the two sexes of this species. The observation
that CPs in combination with cimetidine can be made to
express anthelmintic activity in a site where the pH would
normally be too acidic for them to be able to work effectively, opens the door to other refinements and combination treatments, although, as yet, this is an unexplored
topic.

Limitations of plant derived CPs
In exploring the range of anthelmintic properties of CPs,
we also encountered some limitations to their usefulness.
For example, we found that they were without any significant effects either in terms of motility or actual evident
cuticular damage to Caenorhabditis elegans (Stepek et al,
unpublished observation). In some respects, this was a
disappointing finding, since we had hoped that a rapid
through-put assay could be developed to screen as yet
untested plant sources for useful CP based anthelmintic
properties. We even examined some surface cuticular
mutant strains, but all to no avail (Stepek, Buttle, Lowe,
Duce and Behnke, unpublished observations).
Papaya latex was also without any effect on the parasitic
stages of nematodes that live in the mucosa as distinct
from the lumen of the intestine. The early developmental
stages of H. bakeri are located in the submucosa, often
lying just underneath the serosa, and when treatment was
given to coincide with this phase of infection, the worms
were unaffected, maturing normally and emerging subsequently to live in the gut lumen [75]. Similarly, we found
no effect on the early stages of T. muris, which burrow
deep into the crypts in the large intestine [76]. In some
respect, this may actually be a useful property of these
agents since there is considerable concern about the development of resistance to the available synthetic
anthelmintics, and the argument has been made that
worms in refugia may help to offset the appearance of
resistance and subsequent loss of activity [80,81]. Treatment with CPs would be selective in the sense that it
would be stage-specific, therefore, damaging only those
worms that actually expose parts of their surface in the gut
lumen. Any developmental stage buried in the gut mucosa

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/1/1/29

would escape treatment and help to repopulate the gut
subsequently. This in turn would mean that treatment
would need to be repeated frequently where the exposure
to infective stages is high, such as among ruminants grazing contaminated pasture. However, the treatment would
be directed at the adult stages that are seeding the pasture
with eggs, and would therefore have an impact on transmission. On an even more positive note, it may be possible to modify feeding regimes to include CPs in the
supplementary feed that is often given to grazing livestock
to ensure that they have a balanced diet and do not lack
essential ions and vitamins, particularly during pregnancy
and lactation. An alternative strategy may be to provide
fodder containing parts of pineapples, figs and papaya
that are rich in naturally-occurring CPs. Such approaches
are already being evaluated among small holder farmers
keeping pigs, goats and cattle in Australasia [82,83].
We were surprised to find that the plant-derived CPs did
not affect the motility or cuticle of free-living larvae (L1,
L2 and L3) of H. bakeri, nor the development of larvae
within eggs (Stepek et al., unpublished data). Given that
C. elegans was not affected, this may indicate that free-living and soil-dwelling stages of parasitic nematodes, as
well as totally free-living species, have a different composition to their outermost cuticular layers. CPs are not only
found in plants; they are also secreted by some soil-dwelling bacteria and may be present in the soil [84] and hence,
soil-dwelling nematodes may have evolved defences
against CPs. On the other hand, the mammalian intestine
does not secrete CPs, the key intestinal enzymes being
either serine or aspartic proteinases, against which intestinal nematodes have defences [85,86]. In the absence of
host secreted intestinal CPs, it is not unreasonable for parasitic stages to cease expression of defences against CPs
since cystatins (inhibitors of CPs) would be largely superfluous but nevertheless metabolically demanding to manufacture. In a similar vane, the third stage larvae of P.
muricola, which encyst in the haemocoele of insects, were
also found not to be susceptible to CPs, and it is pertinent
that the Drosophila melanogaster genome encodes 13 Family C1 proteases [87] perhaps suggesting that insect-parasitic larvae of nematodes may have evolved effective
countermeasures as a consequence. Interestingly, some
insects are susceptible to CPs from fruits, and indeed
defence against insect pests is considered to be one of their
essential functions [46,88]. This role is supported by the
disappearance of the protective latex from fruits such as
papaya once they have ripened, although pineapples are
an obvious exception [89].
Although Satrija et al [73,90] failed to find a significant
effect on the ruminant abomasal nematode H. contortus by
oral delivery, we believe that alternative methods of
administration, such as slow release from boluses, and

Page 12 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

Parasites & Vectors 2008, 1:29

combination treatments to temporarily suppress abomasal acidity, may succeed, but they have still to be evaluated. If useful efficacy against the intestinal parasites of
ruminants were to be demonstrated convincingly, the
industry may show some interest, since it is in their role in
livestock agriculture that anthelmintics succeed or fail.

Competition with synthetic anthelmintics and
the scope for improving formulation and
delivery
There can be little doubt that in an environment where
available anthelmintic drugs are rapidly losing efficacy,
alternatives have to be sought before the current drugs
cease having any useful effect. There are already signs that
in some parts of the world livestock farming has become
almost impossible and, for example, farmers have abandoned sheep husbandry because anthelmintics could no
longer be used to control worm burdens [91-93]. The
published information on naturally occurring CPs raises
optimism that they may be useful additions to the available armoury of weapons against GI helminths. Where synthetic anthelmintics are still effective, CPs would stand
little chance in direct competition (more complex manufacture and preparation, and expense), but they may be a
useful weapon where resistance has already tightened its
grip. They may also provide a useful control method
where CP-producing plants are indigenous in tropical and
sub-tropical countries where poor pastoral communities
are the norm and nematode infections are endemic. In
such areas, farmers could conceivably grow their own
anthelmintic crops. However, for commercial production
to become a reality, there is still a long way to go in terms
of provision of adequate supplies and improvement of
formulation and delivery. The pharmaceutical laboratories around the world have invented many sophisticated
and elaborate delivery systems for drugs, and we believe
that it is not beyond the scope of possibilities for contemporary methods of formulation and delivery to be
adapted to improve the access of CPs to the sites within
hosts where their target helminths live.
From an economic standpoint, ruminants must be the
prime target hosts, since this is where anthelmintics succeed or fail in terms of their market success and profitability. Formulations that will enable the CPs to pass through
the rumen, show efficacy in the abomasum and then in
the small and large intestines are not beyond the scope of
achievable objectives, given current advances in pharmacy.
As explained earlier there is already strong evidence that
CPs show efficacy in monogastric hosts such as rodents,
pigs, humans and even poultry. To our knowledge, they
have not been tested in horses, but resistance among
intestinal nematodes of horses is a big problem in the rac-

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/1/1/29

ing and leisure industries, and there are concerns in both
that resistance is becoming more prevalent [6,94].
Satrija et al [72] showed that papaya latex effectively eliminated A. suum from pigs, but were concerned about some
of the side effects in animals given the higher doses which
were more effective at clearing worms (see below for more
on pathology). Although pigs have their own spectrum of
helminths, including several species of nematodes (Table
2), there is little indication that these cause any significant
economic losses on farms where the animals are raised
intensively indoors [95]. However, there are reports that
in developing countries pigs do harbour quite intense
infections with nematodes and these may be responsible
for losses in production efficiency [96,97]. There are also
some indications of resistance [9], although this is not yet
a serious problem in the pig industry worldwide. However, in developed countries there is now a strong trend
for a return to outdoor, free-range pig husbandry, and
free-range farming is undoubtedly going to lead to higher
worm burdens since fields cannot be cleaned as easily or
as frequently as indoor concrete pens [98]. Controlling
worms through regular dosing of outdoor pigs is likely to
see an exacerbation of resistance in the future.
As stated earlier, CPs, have been used as anthelmintics for
humans in the past, even in Europe in the eighteenth century, but these and related products have never prospered
commercially because GI nematode infections are not a
real issue in Europe, and because they were overshadowed
by the synthetic drugs [34]. However, there are indications
that some species of human GI nematodes, notably hookworms, are beginning to show signs of resistance [12,15],
and it may be that we will have to return to these older recipes in the future. Undoubtedly, the formulation and
delivery of CPs for human use can be improved, and this
may help to make them acceptable in modern medicine.

Other uses
The molecular basis of the effect on nematodes is a fertile
field for future exploration. Nothing is known about the
target sites of CPs on the nematode cuticle. These must be
proteins, but what precise role do they play in the cuticle
and where exactly are they situated in relation to other
cuticular molecules such that their digestion has immediate dramatic consequences? And what of tapeworms and
acanthocephalans? Do they share the same surface proteins? This is unlikely given the fundamental differences
in structure between the nematode cuticle, and the platyhelminth and acanthocephalan teguments, but even if the
affected proteins are quite distinct with common target
sites, that in itself will be of considerable interest. Can further research into these aspects help to improve our
understanding of the composition of the nematode cuti-

cle and the platyhelminth and acanthocephalan teguments?

Side effects and pathology
The early reports of the use of papain for treatment of
human infections generally found little or no evidence of
side effects that could be ascribed as additional to the discomfort and pathology attributable to the worms. Jonxis
& Bekius [43] treated children less than 8 years old and
reported that none of the children showed any problems
during and after treatment. Likewise, our experiments in
mice [75], mostly with papaya latex, and those of Satrija
et al [72,74], have failed to indicate any significant side
effects, although the latter authors found some signs of
constipation at the higher doses that they employed.
However, the intestinal mucosa appeared not to have
been affected and this concurs with our own data, where
the treated mice showed a temporary period of weight loss
during the treatment phase, but even this was not substantial. Others have reported more substantial side effects.
Satrija et al. [72] were concerned about the effects on the
gut of pigs treated at the higher dose regimens. De Amorin
et al [64] observed hemorrhagic microfoci in the mucosa
of mice treated with the latices of F. insipida and F. carica,
and commented on lethargy in mice treated at the highest
levels, but we have not observed anything resembling
these symptoms in mice treated with papaya latex. If these
side effects are confirmed in respect of particular preparations of CPs, it is our belief that appropriate formulations
may be devised to reduce their effects on the host, whilst
preserving their anthelmintic properties.
CPs are renowned for their allergenic properties [99]. For
example, Der pI from the house dust mite, which is
responsible for many cases of asthma and various types of
allergies, is related to those from fruits such as papaya
[100]. As far as we are aware, the immunogenic properties
of orally administered fruit-derived CPs have only been
examined by Hale [77], who detected relatively low levels
of circulating bromelain specific IgG after 18 weeks of
daily oral treatment with bromelain. Nevertheless, papain
is known to be allergenic when inhaled, and precautions
would need to be taken if individuals or animals were
presensitized [29].

Who will use and profit from naturally-occurring
anthelmintics?
Whilst we believe that, with some investment, CPs could
be developed into anthelmintics that would have a useful
role in modern agriculture, in order to gain a licence for
use in this capacity, they would have to be of medicinal
quality. In other words, they would have to pass the standard randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials,
and this, we are confident, they can do in respect of
humans and pigs.

However, there is another road. CPs are naturally-occurring proteins in food that is eaten by people and animals
on a daily basis, and it may be that they will turn out to
have a better future as cruder versions in food additives,
perhaps in the niche market of organic farming. Whole
fruits, stems, leaves and extracts may all find a role in this
respect.
There is yet another group of potential users, among the
small-holder farmers in developing countries, who are
only too familiar with the losses caused by GI nematodes
to their livestock [2]. Again, cruder versions of extracts
from plants, or plants of local providence, may be the
solution in these cases and, as pointed out earlier, such trials are already under way in Australasia.
For human use, the CPs would have to jump through the
same legislative hoops as any other medicinal product for
public use, and eventually they would need to be available
in a tablet or syrup form, that is palatable. However, given
the enormous, burgeoning market in the health industry,
CPs may also find a place as herbal medicines on the
shelves of health stores rather than on those of pharmacists, although there is much controversy and a fine line to
tread with respect to what is medicine and what a health
supplement. Acceptable and appropriate labelling of such
products to ensure that they are not classified by health
authorities as conventional medicines is all important.
The biggest challenge of all is to persuade the pharmaceutical industry to support the development of CPs as novel
anthelmintics, but there are seemingly insurmountable
obstacles. How can the problem of prior art be surmounted? There is already a lot of information in the public domain about the anthelmintic properties of CPs, as
we have indicated in this review, and this presents an
impediment to attempts to patent the agents, an essential
step in protecting investments in development. There is
no easy solution, but the fact that we have available natural products that are known to show strong anthelmintic
properties in a world where parasitic worms continue to
cause disease in human populations and losses to the livestock agriculture, and seemingly cannot find the support
to develop them into effective medicines, speaks loudly
about contemporary priorities.
Perhaps the most exciting aspect of the possibilities for
CPs is the scope for developing new crops for farmers in
the developing nations of this world [27]. Currently, only
two species of fig latices have been examined, and yet the
family of trees to which these belong is enormous. There
are hundreds of species of figs that have yet to be tested,
and many other plants also synthesize CPs [101-103].
Some are likely to harbour less, others more effective CPs.
Recently, it has been discovered that highland papayas

Parasites & Vectors 2008, 1:29

(Vasconcellea spp.), of which 21 species are known, contain considerably higher levels of CP activity, associated
with more enzyme in the latex and have more constituent
CPs than C. papaya [104]. Other known sources of CPs
include the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae), as for
example Calotropis procerca [105,106] and Asclepias sinaica
[107], although, unlike those of fruits, the latices of these
plants also contain powerful toxins such as cardiac glycosides. Many more plant sources remain to be discovered,
as shown by a recent survey of plants from Mali [103],
which revealed 9 of ten plant species to express CP activity
and particularly high levels in Cissus qaudrangularis, Securidaca longepedunculus and Stylosanthes erecta. Many of the
source plants require a warm climate, so when suitable
plant species are identified, and once the market for CPs
grows, there will be opportunities for farmers to take on
this new challenge, which in the end, may turn out to be
more lucrative than current conventional crops.
Equally exciting is the possibility that through conventional breeding, scientists of the future may be able to
develop new varieties of the existing species as well as of
new species that have yet to be discovered, that will produce greater quantities of, or more effective, CPs. Where
CPs are co-expressed with toxins, it may be possible
through selective breeding to lose their toxicity without
impairing the yield of CPs. Although controversial, the
methodology of transgenesis is well established in this
age, and offers a further approach to improving the outputs of CPs from plants [38].
Undoubtedly, there are serious obstacles ahead, and a
long path to tread, but we believe that, in this current age,
where despite all the attempts at control, parasitic nematodes are still widely distributed in human populations
and livestock, we need to think ahead and prepare for the
eventuality of all currently available synthetic
anthelmintics failing in the near future. In this context,
standby alternatives will have an important role to play,
but more importantly we believe that, with investment in
improving the delivery and formulations of available CPs,
they can be developed into effective anthelmintics with
roles to play both in the niche markets of organic farming,
providing small holders throughout the developing world
with easily accessible local remedies and perhaps eventually in modern intensive farming and medicine as well.

Additional material
Additional file 1
A single adult female living specimen of Heligmosomoides bakeri was
mounted on a microscope slide in Hanks's saline and sandwiched beneath
a glass coverslip supported on petroleum jelly. The worm was imaged using
a Zeiss Axiovert 135TV inverted microscope and photographed using a
Scion CFW 1310 M digital camera. A solution of 25 μM papain was
introduced below the coverslip and images were captured on a PC using
Streampix III time-lapse software at a frame rate of approximately 1
image every 3 seconds for 30 minutes. The video file was edited and
exported as an mpeg running at 10 times the original speed. The file is
titled "H. bakeri female papain.mpg" and initially shows the worm freely
moving in the papain solution. After the animal forms a helical coil, a
lesion appears on the left of the worm. This is followed by rupture of the
worm and loss of the viscera through the rupture leading to the death of
the parasite.
