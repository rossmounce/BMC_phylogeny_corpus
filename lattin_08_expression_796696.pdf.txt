Abstract
Background: Monocytes and macrophages express an extensive repertoire of G Protein-Coupled
Receptors (GPCRs) that regulate inflammation and immunity. In this study we performed a
systematic micro-array analysis of GPCR expression in primary mouse macrophages to identify
family members that are either enriched in macrophages compared to a panel of other cell types,
or are regulated by an inflammatory stimulus, the bacterial product lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
Results: Several members of the P2RY family had striking expression patterns in macrophages;
P2ry6 mRNA was essentially expressed in a macrophage-specific fashion, whilst P2ry1 and P2ry5
mRNA levels were strongly down-regulated by LPS. Expression of several other GPCRs was either
restricted to macrophages (e.g. Gpr84) or to both macrophages and neural tissues (e.g. P2ry12,
Gpr85). The GPCR repertoire expressed by bone marrow-derived macrophages and thioglycollateelicited peritoneal macrophages had some commonality, but there were also several GPCRs
preferentially expressed by either cell population.
Conclusion: The constitutive or regulated expression in macrophages of several GPCRs identified
in this study has not previously been described. Future studies on such GPCRs and their agonists
are likely to provide important insights into macrophage biology, as well as novel inflammatory
pathways that could be future targets for drug discovery.

Background
Macrophages are key cellular mediators of acute and
chronic inflammation. They can be defined on the basis of

morphology, function (e.g. non-specific uptake of particles) and expression of specific cell surface markers (e.g.
EMR1 that is detected by the F4/80 antibody). EMR1

belongs to the GPCR super-family [1], and it is clear that
macrophages express a diverse repertoire of other GPCRs
[2]. A large number of GPCRs are yet to be deorphanized
and hence, there is great potential for this family in both
the discovery of gene function and in drug development.
In this study we performed a systematic micro-array analysis of GPCR expression in primary mouse macrophages
and identified family members that are either enriched in
macrophages compared to a panel of other cell types, or
are regulated by the pro-inflammatory stimulus, bacterial
LPS. Some of these GPCRs are likely to provide future targets for drug discovery in inflammatory disease settings.

Results
Constitutive GPCR expression in mouse macrophages
Micro-array expression profiling across a panel of mouse
and human tissues has enabled detailed analysis of tissuespecific gene expression [3]. In this study, we analyzed the
constitutive and regulated expression of GPCRs in macrophages by interrogating a more detailed micro-array dataset of 91 murine cell types and tissues [3,4]. This data,
available through NCBIs Gene Expression Omnibus ([5]
accession number GSE10246), can also be used to probe
gene expression profiles for an extensive array of other cell
types.

The cell and tissue panel included two of the most commonly used primary mouse macrophage models; bone
marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) and thioglycollateelicited peritoneal macrophages (TEPM), as well as microglia (a resident tissue macrophage population of the
brain) and the widely utilized macrophage-like cell line,
RAW264. We analyzed the expression patterns of all
GPCRs as defined by the International Union of Basic and
Clinical Pharmacology [6,7]. We then compared the
GPCR expression profiles of BMM and TEPM to the
remaining panel of cell types, and in doing so, identified
67 GPCRs that were detectably expressed either constitutively or in an LPS-induced manner in these primary macrophage populations [see additional file 1].
In order to identify GPCRs that were very highly expressed
by BMM and/or TEPM, we set an arbitrary cut-off in which
normalised expression in either BMM or TEPM was at
least 10-fold greater than the median normalised expression across all cell types. Using this very strict filtering
approach, we identified 33 GPCRs that were enriched in
BMM and/or TEPM as compared to the median normalised expression (Table 1 and 2). This, of course, does not
mean that such genes are exclusively expressed by macrophages. For example, Gpr85 was highly expressed in several macrophage populations and was further upregulated by LPS, but was also expressed in several regions
of the brain (Figure 1a). Nevertheless, included in this set
were GPCRs such as Emr1 (F4/80), C3aR, C5aR, Ccrl2 and

Ccr2 that are known to be either macrophage-specific or
highly expressed by macrophages [8-12], thus validating
our approach. Also included in this list were a number of
GPCRs (e.g. Edg5, P2ry2 and 6) that have not previously
been reported to have a macrophage-restricted expression
pattern (Table 2). As demonstrated in figure 1b, P2ry6
expression was strikingly restricted to macrophages and
two cell types closely related to macrophages (osteoclasts
and dendritic cells), whilst a number of other P2Y family
receptors were also highly expressed by this lineage (Table
2). Consistent with this conclusion, we recently observed
a macrophage-restricted expression pattern for P2ry6
mRNA in a much more limited analysis across seven different cell populations [2]. Gpr84 expression was also
largely restricted to macrophage populations and granulocytes (Figure 1c).
Differential GPCR expression in distinct macrophage
populations
We also searched for GPCRs with differing expression patterns in non-inflammatory macrophages (BMM) versus
inflammatory macrophages (TEPM). Those GPCRs that
were highly expressed by BMM, but not TEPM, included
Ebi2, Calcrl, Ccr2 and 5, Cxcr3, Cx3cr1 and Gpr84, whilst
TEPM expressed much higher levels of Cxcr4, Gpr35,
P2ry1, Ccr1, Cd97, Ccrl2 and Gprc5b (Table 2). As an
example, figure 2a and 2b demonstrate the selective
expression of Calcrl and Gprc5b in BMM and TEPM,

Micro-array analysis was used to identify GPCRs that were highly enriched in primary mouse macrophages (BMM and TEPM). GPCRs identified as
highly enriched in BMM or TEPM were defined as GPCRs where the normalised value was as least 10-fold greater and significantly different (p-value
< 0.05, Student's two-tailed t-test) from the median expression across all cell types. GPCRs are grouped according to their class type on the basis
of sequence similarity as previously described [65-67].

respectively. The divergent expression patterns could, of
course, reflect the differential growth state of the cells;
BMM are cycling cells whilst TEPM are post-proliferative.
Indeed, many of these genes showed similar expression

profiles in BMM and RAW264 cells, both of which are
proliferating macrophage populations. Nonetheless, there
were also GPCRs that had distinct expression levels in
BMM versus TEPM, as well as BMM versus RAW264. It is

therefore unlikely that the differential expression of these
genes in BMM versus TEPM is a reflection of the proliferative state of the cells. Examples of these include Ccr2,
Gpr84 and Fprl1 that were selectively enriched in BMM as
compared to TEPM and RAW264, whilst Gpr68 was
enriched in both TEPM and RAW264 but not BMM. Such
GPCRs may have distinct functions in macrophage differentiation, recruitment or activation. Apart from our analysis of macrophage-enriched GPCRs, we also identified
several GPCRs (e.g. Gpr65, Ccr1, Ccrl1, Cnr2 and P2ry14)
that were highly expressed by multiple leukocyte populations. As an illustration, figure 2c shows the immunerestricted expression of P2ry14.

LPS-regulated GPCR expression in mouse macrophages
LPS, the archetypal macrophage-activating stimulus that
signals via toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, regulated the expression of several GPCRs in macrophages (Table 3 and 4).
Whilst LPS is already known to regulate the expression of
many of these (e.g. Gpr109b/PUMA-G, Fpr1, Ccrl2 and
Ednrb) ([12-16], Sweet et al, unpublished data), regulated
expression of others has not been widely studied. Examples of these include Fzd1, Htr2b, Gpr84 (induced by LPS,
Table 3), and P2ry1 and 5 (repressed by LPS, Table 4). We
recently validated the LPS-mediated repression of P2ry5
mRNA expression in BMM by real time PCR [2]. Figure 3
highlights two examples of regulated GPCR expression:

GPCRs differentially regulated in BMM and TEPM
GPCRs differentially regulated in BMM and TEPM. Micro-array analysis of Calcrl (A), Gprc5b (B) and P2ry14 (C) mRNA

mRNA expression of Gpr84 was induced 10-fold by LPS (6
h) in BMM and 48-fold by LPS (7 h) in TEPM (Figure 3a),
whilst P2ry1 was repressed 7-fold by LPS (6 h) in BMM
and 18-fold by LPS (7 h) in TEPM (Figure 3b).
The LPS time courses studied in BMM (2, 6 and 24 h) and
TEPM (1 and 7 h) were not identical and so it is difficult
to make definitive conclusions about non-conserved regulation by LPS in these two cell populations. Nonetheless,
we did identify genes that appeared to be differentially
regulated by LPS in BMM or TEPM at similar time points.

Gpr18, P2ry2, P2ry12 and Adrb2 were all strongly regulated by LPS in BMM, but not TEPM (Table 3, 4), whilst
LPS regulated Gprc5b expression in TEPM, but not BMM
(Table 4). The effects of LPS could even be opposing in
these two cell populations; Prokr1 was induced 37-fold by
LPS in BMM (6 h), but repressed 20-fold in TEPM (7 h)
(Figure 3c). Again some of these differences may be
explained by the proliferative state of the cells; LPS triggers
growth arrest in BMM and so some of the LPS-regulated
genes unique to BMM may reflect this phenomenon. This
is clearly not the case for all genes however (e.g. P2ry14

Micro-array analysis was used to assess the gene expression profile of GPCRs upon LPS treatment in primary mouse macrophages (BMM and TEPM).
GPCRs regulated by LPS in primary mouse macrophages were defined as those that were 2-fold or greater up-regulated at 2, 6 or 24 h LPS in BMM and/
or 1 or 7 h LPS in TEPM (and significantly different from controls, p-value < 0.05, Student's two-tailed t-test). Values shown depict gene expression
relative to untreated control (0 h). GPCRs are grouped according to their class type on the basis of sequence similarity as previously described [65-67].

signaling pathways may exist in BMM versus TEPM.

Micro-array analysis was used to assess the gene expression profiles of GPCRs upon LPS treatment in primary mouse macrophages (BMM and
TEPM). GPCRs regulated by LPS in primary mouse macrophages were defined as those that were 2-fold or greater down-regulated at 2, 6 or 24 h
LPS in BMM and/or 1 or 7 h LPS in TEPM (and significantly different from controls, p-value < 0.05, Student's two-tailed t-test). Values shown depict
gene expression relative to untreated control (0 h). GPCRs are grouped according to their class type on the basis of sequence similarity as
previously described [65-67].

or (c) regulated by the pro-inflammatory stimulus LPS,
one can make some inferences about the role of specific
GPCRs in macrophage biology. One of the most obvious
findings from our analysis was that many of the P2Y
purinergic receptors, which detect purine and pyrimidine

nucleotides, were expressed in a restricted and/or regulated fashion in macrophages. Mechanical stress, cellular
injury, inflammatory stimuli such as LPS, degranulation
of mast cells and hypoxia can all increase extracellular
concentrations of ATP and UTP [17-20]. Consequently,

these receptors are very likely to impact upon macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses.
Of the P2Y family, perhaps most striking in its expression
pattern was P2ry6, which was essentially restricted to cells
of the myeloid lineage. P2ry6 mRNA levels were greatly
elevated in BMM, TEPM, RAW264 cells, microglia, osteoclasts and dendritic cells, compared to all other cell types
(Figure 1b). P2ry6 expression in osteoclasts, which are a

closely related lineage to macrophages, has been confirmed by others [21]. Whilst no previous studies have
indicated that P2ry6 expression is restricted to the monocyte/macrophage lineage, there is evidence to suggest that
this receptor does regulate the function of macrophages.
UDP, which is reportedly a selective P2RY6 agonist
[22,23], triggered interleukin (IL)-8 release from the
human monocyte-like cell line, THP-1 [24]. Conversely,
the P2RY6 receptor antagonists, anthraquinone-sulfonic
acid derivative reactive blue 2 and suramin, inhibited LPSinduced IL-8 production by THP-1 cells [24]. In microglia,
P2ry6 mRNA expression was up-regulated in response to
neuronal damage and UDP promoted phagocytosis by
microglia, thus implying a role for P2RY6 in the clearance
of damaged or dead neuronal cells [23]. Our observation
that this receptor is widely expressed in the mononuclear
phagocyte system suggests that this receptor may have a
broader function in sensing and engulfing damaged cells
throughout the body, as well as promoting pro-inflammatory responses in response to LPS and/or UDP.
This laboratory previously reported that P2ry5 mRNA
expression was dramatically repressed by LPS in human
and mouse macrophages [2], a finding supported by
micro-array data presented here. This receptor was originally classified as a member of the P2Y receptor family on
the basis of sequence identity and its ability to bind the
nucleotides ATP and ADP [25]. Nucleotides failed to initiate downstream signaling from this receptor however
[26], and it is therefore possible that P2RY5 acts as an
antagonist of other P2Y receptors and restricts the macrophage response to extracellular nucleotides. Down-regulation of P2RY5 in response to a macrophage activating
stimulus such as LPS might remove this inhibitory effect,
thus allowing activated macrophages to respond to nucleotides. Alternatively, it is possible that the initial assignment of P2RY5 as a P2 receptor was incorrect. Crossgenome phylogenetic analysis showed that it clustered
with a heterogenous group of receptors including the protease-activated receptors, as well as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPA) and sphingosylphosphorylcholine (S1P)
receptors, rather than with other P2Y receptors [27]. In
this case, LPS-mediated macrophage activation would
presumably render cells unresponsive to the true ligand
for this receptor.
Emerging evidence also implicates other P2Y receptors in
macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses. For
example, extracellular ATP, an agonist of P2RY2, induced
IL-6 transcription in human monocyte-derived macrophages [28] and chemotaxis in human neutrophils [29],
while the P2RY1 agonist 2-methylthio ATP increased IL-6
secretion from mouse splenocytes [30]. In support of a
role for P2Y ATP receptors in macrophage function, and
consistent with our data, P2ry1 and P2ry2 mRNAs were

expressed at high levels in macrophages and LPS-stimulated monocytes [31]. Apart from these P2Y family members, P2RY12 was also reported to be selectively expressed
in microglia in the rat brain [32]. Our analysis also
showed that this receptor was highly enriched in microglia, as well as BMM, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, osteoclasts and a variety of lymphoid and neural tissues [see
additional file 2a]. Finally, the P2Y-like receptor, P2ry14
(Gpr105), which is a receptor for UDP-conjugated sugars,
mediated chemotaxis of bone marrow hematopoietic
stem cells [33]. Despite the emerging literature that suggests a role for P2Y receptors in macrophage-mediated
migration and inflammatory responses, a clear understanding of the selective agonists of these receptors and
their interplay with each other and non-P2Y receptors is
lacking. Nonetheless, our demonstration of the restricted
and regulated expression of this family in macrophages
identifies them as promising candidates for further analysis.
Other GPCRs that had a relatively restricted expression
pattern and were strongly expressed by macrophages
include Edg5, Gpr85 and Gpr84 (Table 2, Figure 1a and 1c,
Additional file 2b). Edg5 is one of eight members of the
endothelial differentiation gene (EDG) family of GPCRs
that recognize LPA and S1P [34]. Several studies have documented potent effects of the EDG5 ligand, S1P on macrophages. Rat alveolar macrophages responded to S1P by
producing O2- at levels comparable to those induced by
LPS or formyl-Methionyl-Leucyl-Phenylalanine [35]. Not
surprisingly, given this finding, anti-microbial effects of
S1P have been reported. In human monocyte-derived
macrophages or THP-1 cells infected with M. smegmatis or
M. tuberculosis, S1P reduced intracellular bacterial loads in
a dose-dependent manner. Similar effects of S1P were also
apparent in mice infected with M. smegmatis or M. tuberculosis [36]. Apart from activating anti-microbial
responses, S1P also provided a survival signal to both
mouse and human macrophage cell lines upon subsequent exposure to an apoptosis-inducing signal [37].
EDG1 was implicated in this response, but given the high
expression of Edg5 reported here, this receptor may also
be involved in macrophage responses to S1P.
Expression of the SREB (super conserved receptor
expressed in brain) family member Gpr85 (Sreb2) was
restricted to macrophages and neuronal tissues (Figure
1a). Whilst the expression of Gpr85 in the central nervous
system was previously reported [38-40], a function has yet
to be identified. The co-regulated expression of receptors
such as Gpr85 in neural tissues and leukocyte populations
may provide a mechanism for the neuro-immune crosstalk that has been observed in several studies [41,42].

http://www.immunome-research.com/content/4/1/5

Gpr84 is an orphan GPCR that was strikingly restricted to
BMM and microglia in an unstimulated state (Table 2, Figure 1c) and was strongly up-regulated by LPS in both
BMM and TEPM (Figure 3a, Table 3). This up-regulation
is consistent with elevated Gpr84 expression in microglia
and tissue macrophages in an endotoxin shock model
[43]. Microglia also expressed high levels of Gpr84 in the
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of
multiple sclerosis [43]. These data imply that GPR84 has
a role in neuroinflammation, but the exact function is difficult to predict without any knowledge of a ligand. Nonetheless, given the highly restricted expression pattern of
Gpr84 mRNA, antibodies against this receptor may provide useful tools for tracking macrophage populations in
vivo.
As with Gpr84, mRNA for several other GPCRs, particularly chemokine receptors, were differentially expressed
between various unstimulated macrophage populations.
TEPM expressed elevated levels of mRNA for Cxcr4, Ccr1,
Ccrl2, whilst BMM expressed higher levels of Ccr2, Cx3cr1
and Cxcr3. The fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 has been
identified as a marker of patrolling monocytes that survey
the endothelial surface [44] and its down-regulation on
macrophages that have already trafficked to an inflammatory site is not surprising. Conversely, CXCR4 has a wellcharacterized function in targeting leukocytes and their
progenitors away from the circulation [45], consistent
with its enhanced expression in TEPM. Apart from chemokine receptors, the expression of a number of other
GPCRs was different between BMM and TEPM. For example, the thrombin-related receptor, Ebi2 [46], was strongly
expressed in BMM but not TEPM, whilst Gprc5b was
enriched in TEPM but not BMM. Such differences are
likely to contribute to functional divergence between tissue macrophage and inflammatory macrophage populations.
Many of the GPCRs that were highly expressed by macrophages in an unstimulated state (described above), were
also regulated by LPS. Several other GPCRs were weakly
expressed by unstimulated macrophages but were
strongly regulated by LPS. One such example was the frizzled family member, Fzd1. Frizzleds (Fzd) represent the
cell membrane receptors for a family of secreted glycoproteins called wingless-related proteins (WNTs). Wnts play
essential roles in development, including cell fate determination, adhesion, polarity, migration and proliferation
[47-50]. The WNT family has also been implicated in
immune regulation. For example, the WNT family member, WNTD, acted as a negative feedback regulator of Toll
signaling in Drosophila [51]. In human macrophages,
WNT5A expression was up-regulated by TLR ligands, as
well as challenge with M. tuberculosis and M. avium, and
the WNT5A/Frizzled-5 (FZD5) pathway promoted IL-12

Immunome Research 2008, 4:5

production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
[52]. The striking up-regulation of Fzd1 in BMM (17-fold
at 6 h LPS) implies that this FZD family member shares
similar functions in regulating macrophage inflammatory
responses.
We also identified several GPCRs that were differentially
regulated by LPS in BMM and TEPM. In BMM, Prokr1 was
transiently induced by LPS (37-fold at 6 h) but repressed
in TEPM (20-fold at 7 h). PROKR1 is a receptor for prokineticin 1 (PK1), a peptide that regulates monocyte differentiation, as well as macrophage activation and
migration. PK1 triggered the differentiation of both
murine and human bone marrow progenitor cells into the
monocyte/macrophage lineage [53], and reprogrammed
the response of human monocytes to LPS by amplifying
IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) production,
but inhibiting IL-10 release [53]. The differential regulation of Prokr1 by LPS in BMM versus TEPM implies that
this receptor has distinct functions during activation of tissue versus inflammatory macrophage populations.
Gpr18 was induced 52-fold in BMM following 6 h LPS
exposure, while it remained unchanged in TEPM. This
receptor was also highly expressed in other immune cell
populations including B cells, T cells and DC cells [see
additional file 2c]. N-arachidonylglycine (NAGly), a conjugate of arachidonic acid and glycine, is an endogenous
ligand for GPR18 [54] that was reported to suppress
inflammatory pain and have analgesic properties [55,56].
Given the potent regulation of Gpr18 expression in BMM
by LPS, NAGly is also likely to regulate macrophage function. The adenosine receptor, Adora2b was also strongly
induced by LPS in BMM (191-fold at 6 h) yet was only
modestly regulated (3-fold at 7 h) in TEPM. Adenosinemediated activation of this receptor augmented IL-10 production by RAW264 cells in response to LPS [57]. In contrast, adenosine attenuated LPS-induced production of
the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF [58-61] and IL-12
[60,62] in mouse and human macrophages. Inducible
Adora2b expression may therefore contribute to feedback
regulation of macrophage inflammatory responses.

Conclusion
In this study, we have documented several GPCRs that are
detectably expressed in primary mouse macrophages
(BMM, TEPM), enriched in either or both BMM and
TEPM, or regulated in activated macrophages (LPS-stimulated BMM and/or TEPM). For some of these genes, constitutive or regulated expression in macrophages has not
previously been described. Future studies on such GPCRs
and their agonists are likely to provide important insights
into macrophage biology, as well as novel inflammatory
pathways which could be future targets for drug discovery.

Methods
Cell culture and reagents
All cell lines and tissues were sourced from 8â10 week old
male C57Bl/6 mice, with the exception of female-specific
organs, which were sourced from female mice. All procedures were carried out in accordance with local guidelines
for animal research. For female tissues, material was
pooled from three females and for each female an average
four embryos resulting in four umbilical cords and placentas were obtained. For other tissues, material was
derived from a pool of three males. Biological replicates
were defined as independent RNA preparations from
independent pools of mice. Technical replicates were
defined as independent amplifications from the same
RNA sample. The full list of cell lines and tissues profiled,
as well as further details on biological versus technical
replication, is provided in additional file 3 (key to figures
1, 2 and additional file 2).

Mouse BMM were prepared from bone marrow cells from
femurs of adult C57Bl/6 mice by culturing for 7 days in
complete medium (RPMI containing 10% FCS, 20 U/ml
penicillin, 20 Î¼g/ml streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine
(Invitrogen) in the presence of 10 000 U/ml CSF-1 (a gift
from Chiron, Emeryville, CA) on bacteriological plastic
plates. On day 7, BMM were treated with 10 ng/mL Salmonella minnesota LPS (Re595 mutant, Sigma) for 2, 6 or 24
h, and RNA was extracted. To generate TEPM, cells were
harvested from the peritoneal cavity of C57Bl/6 mice 3 d
after i.p. administration of 3% thioglycollate broth
(Difco). Cells were then plated onto tissue culture plastic
for 2 h, after which time non-adherent cells were removed
by washing with PBS. Adherent TEPM were then treated
with LPS for 1 or 7 h, or were left untreated, and RNA was
extracted. Microglia were generated from cultures of
mixed cortical cells. After 10 d culture, microglia were separated from astroglia by shaking on an orbital shaker (180
rpm, 20 min, 37Â°C) in the presence of 12 mM lidocaine
(Sigma).
RNA and cDNA preparation
RNA extraction from mammalian cells or tissues was performed using RNeasy kits (Qiagen) or the standard Trizol
protocol. If tissue amounts were more than 50 mg per
mouse when dissected, tissues were pulverized while frozen. RNA was prepared separately for every mouse in
order to identify samples with potentially degraded RNA.
Trizol-extracted RNA was purified with a Qiagen RNeasy
column. For BMM, osteoblasts and osteoclasts contaminating genomic DNA was removed during the RNeasy
cleanup using DNaseI (Qiagen). The integrity and concentration of RNA was determined via microfluidic analysis
on a bio-analyser (Agilent Technologies) or by analysis on
a BioRad Experion (BioRad). Pooling occurred at the RNA
level. For samples containing more than two Î¼g total RNA

Page 10 of 13

Immunome Research 2008, 4:5

available after pooling, standard Affymetrix single amplification was performed using two Î¼g total RNA. For
pooled samples containing less than two Î¼g total RNA,
100 ng total RNA (or 50 ng for thymocyte SP CD8+) was
used in a standard Affymetrix double amplification protocol. The starting quantity of RNA for specific tissues is
included in additional file 3.
Microarray analysis
Standard Affymetrix protocols were used to process
Affymetrix MOE430_2 microarrays. All CEL file images
were processed as a single group using gcRMA [63,64],
after which the data for each gene was rescaled using pergene normalisation to the median (for tissue specificity
analysis) or per-gene normalisation to untreated control
samples (for analysis of BMM and TEPM gene regulation
by LPS). The microarray data described have been deposited in NCBIs Gene Expression Omnibus [5] and are
accessible through GEO Series accession number
GSE10246. GPCRs identified as highly enriched in BMM
or TEPM were defined as transcripts where the normalised
expression value was as least 10-fold greater in BMM/
TEPM when compared to the median expression across all
cell types and where BMM/TEPM expression significantly
deviated from this median value (p-value < 0.05, student's
two-tailed t-test). GPCRs regulated by LPS in primary
mouse macrophages were defined as those whose normalised expression values were two-fold or greater up- or
down-regulated at any point in the time course (2, 6 or 24
h LPS in BMM and/or 1 or 7 h LPS in TEPM) compared to
the unstimulated state (0 LPS). LPS regulated genes were
also filtered on the basis of statistical significance (p-value
< 0.05, student's two-tailed t-test). All statistical testing
was performed using the GeneSpring GX software, with
the cross-gene error model function enabled.
