Abstract
Background: The majority of the genes involved in the inflammatory response are highly
conserved in mammals. These genes are not significantly expressed under normal conditions and
are mainly regulated at the transcription and prost-transcriptional level. Transcription from the
promoters of these genes is very dependent on NF-κB activation, which integrates the response
to diverse extracellular stresses. However, in spite of the high conservation of the pattern of
promoter regulation in κB-regulated genes, there is inter-species diversity in some genes. One
example is nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS-2), which exhibits a species-specific pattern of expression
in response to infection or pro-inflammatory challenge.
Results: We have conducted a comparative genomic analysis of NOS-2 with different
bioinformatic approaches. This analysis shows that in the NOS-2 gene promoter the position and
the evolutionary divergence of some conserved regions are different in rodents and non-rodent
mammals, and in particular in primates. Two not previously described distal regions in rodents that
are similar to the unique upstream region responsible of the NF-κB activation of NOS-2 in humans
are fragmented and translocated to different locations in the rodent promoters. The rodent
sequences moreover lack the functional κB sites and IFN-γ response sites present in the
homologous human, rhesus monkey and chimpanzee regions. The absence of κB binding in these
regions was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays.
Conclusion: The data presented reveal divergence between rodents and other mammals in the
location and functionality of conserved regions of the NOS-2 promoter containing NF-κB and IFNγ response elements.

Background
The biological activity of most genes involved in adaptive
responses is regulated mainly at the level of transcription,
and to a lower extent at the post-transcriptional level [1].

A primary example is the highly conserved mammalian
inflammatory response, which involves the coordinated
transcriptional induction of multiple genes. In this process, an important integrating role is played by the tranPage 1 of 10

scription factor NF-κB [2,3]. Extensive and detailed
research has revealed common, evolutionarily conserved
patterns in the regulation of NF-κB target genes [4-8].
However, the NOS-2 gene presents an exception. The
NOS-2 coding region is highly conserved in all vertebrates
[9,10], but its transcriptional regulation differs significantly, with a more restricted inducibility in primate species than that seen in rodents and other mammals. We
have analyzed whether these different responses could be
explained, at least in part, by divergent evolution of the
NOS-2 promoter sequence.
Extensive studies of the mouse NOS-2 promoter have
shown that only the proximal 1 kb sequence of the 5'flanking region is necessary for complete inducibility by
LPS and cytokine treatment [11-13]. To confer full promoter activity in the rat, 2 kb of additional 5' flanking
region are required [14]. In contrast, the proximal region
of the human NOS-2 promoter shows no inducibility: the
proximal 3.7 kb sequence does not respond to LPS or
cytokines in DLD-1 colon cells [15] or A549 lung epithelial cells [16]; and although the 4.7 kb upstream region
has basal promoter activity in liver (AKN-1) and A549
cells, it does not show any cytokine-inducible activity
[17]. These differences between human and rodent NOS2 promoters correlate with differences in NOS-2 expression and NO synthesis, which is markedly less inducible
in human cells.
Vera et al. (1996) [17] cloned 16 kb of the human NOS-2
5'-upstream flanking region and generated deletional
NOS-2 promoter sequences ranging in size from 1.3 to 16
kb. Compared to the 1.3 kb sequence, they observed a 3fold increase in the activity of promoter regions containing the -5.8 kb sequence, a 4-fold increase with the -7.2 kb
sequence, and a 9-fold increase with the -16 kb sequence.
Moreover, deletion of the region between -2.1 and -4.7 kb
showed that this sequence lacks cytokine responsiveness.
NF-κB activation is required for cytokine induction of
both human and rodent NOS-2. Mutational analysis of
putative NF-κB sites in the 7.2 kb promoter region of the
human NOS-2 promoter identified four κB sites between
-5.2 and -6.1 kb, a region termed the distal NF-κB
enhancer region [13,18]. We have compared the distribution of κB and other transcription factor binding sites
(TFBSs) in the promoter region of NOS-2 in seven different mammals to evaluate their relative degree of evolutionary conservation and to investigate whether a pattern
of changes in their promoter sequences could be established. For this analysis, we downloaded the corresponding promoter sequences from EnsEMBL. An 11 kb
sequence spanning from -10 kb to +1 kb was first
obtained from the Human Genome, and the available
homologues in other species (orthologues) were then

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/271

directly selected and downloaded. Using this strategy, we
identified multiple conserved TFBSs that can be related to
the activity of these promoters, at the time that we compared the evolutionary divergence in the enhancer and
proximal region of the NOS-2 promoter to obtain information on the relative selective pressure on these
sequences. Taken together, the data obtained are in agreement with the different inducibility of NOS-2 observed in
mammals.

Results
Analysis of the promoter region of NOS-2 reveals different
degrees of sequence conservation among mammals
The -10 kb to +1 kb sequence of NOS-2 genes from different species were aligned by four independent methods to
identify conserved regulatory sequences (see Methods).
Mulan's graphical alignment is presented in Fig. 1A, with
the human sequences as the reference. Although agreement was not exact, most Mulan aligned sequences coincided with the alignments generated by AVID and BlastZ
(zPICTURE), and with MEME detected motifs. Because
chimp is phylogenetically very close to human, most of
the conserved regions were identical to their human counterparts. Consequently, analysis of these sequences was
not very informative, and the alignments of chimpanzee
sequences are not presented. In contrast, although human
and murine gene promoters were generally similar, there
were some significant differences. No similarities were
found between any of the analyzed promoters in mammals and the available fish orthologues (tetraodon, fugu
and zebrafish). The proximal region of the NOS-2 promoter was well conserved in all species analyzed, and two
domains could be defined: one from -700 bp to +500 bp,
the other from -1.3 kb to -1.0 kb. We also noted that
whereas some regions were conserved only between dog
and human (and therefore chimp), there was a region,
located between -3 kb and -4 kb, that was conserved
between rodents and primates but absent in dog. This
analysis also showed that domains similar to the NF-κB
enhancer region located between -5.2 and -6.1 kb in the
human NOS-2 promoter [13,19] are also found in chimp,
dog, cow, macaque, mouse and rat orthologues (Fig. 1A).
The human NOS-2 distal NF-κB enhancer has two
disrupted similar motifs in rodents
The MEME output revealed that the distal NF-κB enhancer
region in the human NOS-2 promoter and the similar
sequences in dog, mouse and rat contain two non-overlapping and very conserved motifs. Sequence analysis
showed that this region is split in the rodent promoters
(Fig. 1B) with one of the component motifs translocated
further upstream (-7618 in mouse and -7388 in rat, compared to -5114 in human, -5552 in macaque, -6733 in
cow and -4781 in dog). The position of the other motif
was maintained positioning all the mammalian species

examined (-6076 in human, -5981 in dog, -6524 in
macaque, -7701 in cow, -6593 in mouse and -6649 in rat).
When compared with human, dog and macaque, the
whole region in cow was located further from the transcription start site (TSS). Nevertheless, it was not disrupted as in rodents. Mulan and zPICTURE also detected
this fragmentation of the rodent sequence (Fig. 1A and
data not shown), expanding their extension through the
use of a gap-permitted alignment algorithm. AVID
detected the conserved sequence of the -5 kb to -6.5 kb
human NF-κB enhancer region in dog, cow and macaque,
but did not detect the similar but fragmented sequences in
rodents. This is probably due to the global alignment
strategy used in AVID, which assumes that the order of the
functionally conserved regions has been preserved [20].
Evolutionary analysis the proximal promoter and
enhancer regions reveals differences in rodents
We calculated the evolutionary distance between every
pair of species in the proximal promoter, in the enhancer
region and in the fifth intron (the last for reference, as an
approximation to the neutral rate of substitution). Afterwards, we computed the branch length for each sequences
from the unique common ancestor for each trio of species
using two phylogenetic schemes (see Methods). The
results are shown in Figure 2, and they reveal that the
proximal promoter and the enhancer have a similar
branch length in primates and dog (cow presenting a
branch even shorter in the enhancer). However, in mouse
and rat the enhancer seems to evolve almost to the same
rate than intron sequences. This result suggests that selective pressures are almost absent in the rodent enhancers,
probably due to a loss of function in this region. Alternatively, the high efficiency of the rodent proximal promoter
contributed to the loss of biological relevance of the
enhancer regions (see Discussion).
Bioinformatic analysis of κB sites and other inflammationrelated TFBSs
The 11 kb NOS-2 promoter sequences were scanned with
Match (TRANSFAC Professional 8.2) to ensure that the
published κB sites were identified. Interestingly, high
quality matrices from TRANSFAC (minimizing false positives) did not detect any κB sites in the human promoter,
and only detected one in mouse (at -998 bp, described to
be functional) and one in rat (at -2.46 kb), which has
never been described in the literature. In view of these
data, the promoters were scanned with all TRANSFAC vertebrate matrices. The results are summarized in Table 1.
Four human elements were identified correctly; as Kleinert and co-workers pointed out [8] the functionality of the
human κB at -119 is controversial. Three other functionally recognized human κB sites were not detected. In
mouse and rat we found several sites, including the two
functionally recognized murine κB sites. Strikingly, this

derived from the evolutionary divergence of the proximal

used. Branch length to species i (Li) was derived from pairwise distances (Di-j) according to an exact equation (see
methods). See text for further explanation.

analysis did not detect the described downstream and
upstream κB sites in rat (highly similar to the mouse functional sites). Moreover, we found six putative sites in the
rat promoter between -1601 and -2460. This is the region
described by Zhang and co-workers to be important for
full induction of NOS-2 by LPS and/or cytokines [14],
although these authors' data indicated involvement of elements other than κB [21].
Since this approach still failed to detect previously recognized human κB sites, we defined a consensus κB
sequence covering all functional κB elements described in
NOS-2 promoters (NFKB-NOS2, see Methods). Scanning
of NOS-2 promoters of human, dog, rat and mouse for
this consensus sequence obviously detected all known
human κB sites but the incidence of putative sites was
extremely high: there are 79 sites that match that consensus sequence in human, 80 in chimpanzee, 71 in mouse,
and 85 in rat (data not shown).
NOS-2 is positively regulated by NF-κB, but also by IFN-γ
dependent transcription factors (TFs) and AP-1, all of
them key TFs for the regulation of the inflammatory
response. In order to gain insight in the evolution of NOS2 regulatory TFBSs, further analysis of NF-κB, AP-1 and
IFN-γ regulated TFs was performed using MultiTF and
TRANSFAC matrices. MultiTF is a phylogenetic footprint-

ing tool interconnected with Mulan, a strategy that
searches for TFBSs conserved among all the sequences
aligned (i.e. multi-conserved sites). We included all mammal NOS-2 promoters in the analysis and tried all possible combinations of human vs. other mammal species
alignments. A schematic representation of the results is
shown (Fig. 3) and detailed information about these conserved TFBSs is available in additional file 1. It is remarkable the conservation of these sites in the distal regulatory
domain in primates, dog and cow, but not in rodents.
None of the human AP-1, IRF-1 and STAT-1 sites are conserved in the rodents' distal regions. Only the equivalent
κB sites -5201 (human) and -8307 (rodents) are detected
as conserved between primates and rodents with MultiTF,
but we proved that this site is not functional in mouse by
EMSAs (see below). A unique proximal conserved κB site
was found in human that was present also in the dog and
rodent NOS-2 promoters (at -115) and it corresponds to
the functional κB binding sites from the promoters of
mouse (at -110; -85 in the literature) and rat (at -71) NOS2 genes. Sequence conservation of this site in human
NOS-2 is interesting since apparently it is not functional.
In this connection it might prove significant that the
human and chimpanzee NOS-2 promoters contain an
(A)n simple repeat downstream of this putative -115 κB
site, between -94 and -75 bp. This sequence does not

occur in dog, mouse or rat (alignments provided in the
additional data file 2). This (A)n repeat in primates might
be responsible, at least in part, for the lesser importance or
loss of function of this human κB site (see Discussion).
NF-κB does not bind to mouse motifs homologous to the
human NF-κB enhancer region
All the previous data suggested that the distal rodent
regions homologous to the human enhancer are probably
not functional, at least not in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli. In contrast, the enhancer region is likely to be
important not only in human, but also probably in other
primates and dog too, based on their sequence similarity,
position from the TSS and pattern of conserved TFBSs. As
NOS-2 induction by LPS is totally dependent of NF-κB, we
decided to test NF-κB binding to some regions in the
mouse enhancer region by EMSA, in macrophages
exposed to LPS. EMSA probes were designed based on
mouse-human MEME alignments with the human
sequences containing functional human κB sites. The
functional mouse κB site at -103 (-87) was used as a positive control (Fig. 4). None of the three new putative
mouse κB sequences tested was capable of binding NF-κB,
and this probably indicates that this region does not operate as an NF-κB enhancer of NOS-2 transcription in
mouse.

Discussion
An immense amount of non-coding genomic sequence is
now available from different species, allowing the com-

Nevertheless, the important distal NF-κB enhancer region
between -5.2 kb and -6 kb in the NOS-2 promoter, containing four κB sites, was described by Taylor and coworkers [13], and an additional κB site at -8293 bp was
identified by Moss' group [19].

parison of large 5' upstream regions from orthologous
genes. Functional promoter analysis is normally performed by cloning part of the 5' upstream region of the
gene into an appropriate reporter vector, such as used for
luciferase assays. The regions cloned are normally no
longer than 2 or 3 kb, for two reasons. The first is that
most regulatory elements are located close to the transcription start site. The second reason is technical: cloning
of long inserts and cell transfection with large plasmids is
complex.
The minimal promoter regions of many NF-κB regulated
genes, as COX-2, IκBα or IκBβ, in mouse and human are
located within the proximal 1 or 2 kb 5' upstream region,
and the same applies to the mouse NOS-2 promoter. Thus
for these genes, all the important regulatory regions are
contained within this proximal 1 or 2 kb sequence. However, eukaryotic promoters frequently contain very distant
enhancer elements that are important, or indeed sometimes essential, for the regulation of gene transcription
[22]. This is the case with the human NOS-2 promoter,
where maximal induction in luciferase assays requires a
16 kb promoter [17]. The effort of cloning this insert was
necessary because human NOS-2 is poorly induced, or
not induced at all, with shorter promoters. This is such a
long sequence that the regulatory elements located
between -9 kb and -16 kb still remain to be identified.

We were interested in exploring larger upstream regions of
the NOS-2 promoter in mouse and other vertebrate species other than human, to see if we could find sequence
similarities among them. Promoter length in eukaryotes is
very variable; Nardone and co-workers [23] proposed that
bioinformatic promoter analysis should extend, ideally,
for 50–100 kb in either direction from the gene coding
sequence, and should include introns and neighboring
genes. Moreover, Dieterich and co-workers [24] estimated
that 10 kb upstream from the transcription start site is sufficient in most cases. We selected 10 kb upstream plus 1
kb downstream from the TSS for a total of 11 kb per
sequence, because this provides a good starting point with
enough computational burdens. The 11 kb sequence used
in this work contained all the described regulatory regions
in human NOS-2 promoter, the longest known of all the
promoters studied here. MEME (at the settings used)
allowed us to detect 10 conserved motifs ranging from 6
to 120 base pairs, but did not give us information about
the overall similarity between sequences; mVISTA, zPICTURE and Mulan provided this information. We preferred
Mulan for graphical alignments and calculation of ECR
lengths and similarities because it can detect sequence
rearrangements (AVID/mVISTA cannot) and for its
dynamic high power and flexibility. The Mulan graphical
alignments are shown in Fig. 1A. MEME was very useful
for highlighting the two motifs in rodents that were similar to the human distal NF-κB enhancer region, but which
are separated, with one motif located further upstream, in
the rodent sequences. This feature was also detected with
Mulan and zPICTURE, and we present a schematic model
in Fig. 1B to show the position of these regions in the
human and mouse promoters. The human NF-κB
enhancer region is entirely conserved in dog, cow and
macaque; but unlike the case in rodents, there is one
unique conserved region. The rodents are phylogenetically closer to human than to dog and cow [25], so we
hypothesize that a translocation of part of this ancestral
region has occurred in the rodent linage after its speciation from primates.
In addition to these strategies of analysis, we performed
an evolutionary analysis in order to evaluate the selective
pressures in the proximal promoter and the enhancer, to
gain insight into functional differences among the species
studied. The data obtained suggested a similar conservation of the enhancer and the proximal promoter in nonrodent species, while mouse and rat showed a comparative higher rate of evolution (in relation to intron

sequences) suggesting lower selective constraint in these
species.
These conserved distal sequences have not been previously described in rodents. MEME alignment with the κB
sites from the human sequence identified three putative
κB sites, but none showed any binding activity in EMSA
(Fig. 3). The mouse κB-like probes differed from the
homologous human sequences as follows: mouse -5.2 κBlike, 18 bp out of 28 bp equal to human (18/28); mouse
-5.8 κB-like, 20/28; and mouse -8.3 κB-like, 13/26. Thus,
these mouse sequences probably do not bind NF-κB
because, despite the similarity of the regions where they
are locate, the nucleotide substitutions in mouse sites are
critical for NF-κB binding in EMSA. The effects of these
sequence variations in the κB sites have been studied in
depth and their affinity appears to be dependent on the
nature of the co-activators engaged in the stabilization
and activity of the NF-κB complexes [2].
These negative results are in agreement with the accepted
idea that only the proximal 1000 bp of the 5'-flanking
sequence is necessary for mouse NOS-2 promoter induction by NF-κB, while human NOS-2 requires the distal
enhancer. The MultiTF results showed that not only is the
overall structure of the human NF-κB enhancer region
entirely conserved in dog, cow and primates, but also that
some inflammatory TFBSs sites not present in rodents are
conserved in the other species. We cannot be sure that
mice lost these hypothetical ancestral κB sites, or whether
the human κB sites were gained during evolution, but the
analysis of multi-conserved TFBSs (Fig. 4) supports the
first possibility. The functionality of these putative κB sites
in macaque, dog and cow needs to be tested before making any conclusion, but if the sites do retain activity, that
would support the hypothesis of a loss of functionality
during the evolution of rodents.
Controversy exists about the functionality of the human
proximal κB site located at -115 (additional file 1). Taylor
and co-workers concluded that this site is non-functional,
while others have reported a certain relevance (see [8]).
We have found that this region is very conserved indeed
(it corresponds to the multi-conserved κB site indicated
after alignment of the human, dog and rodent NOS-2 promoters; additional file 2). Whether it is functional or not
remains unclear, but it is certain that this region is less
functional than the homologous site in mouse and rat.
The (A)n simple repeat we found downstream of human
and chimp putative -115 κB sites is absent in dog, mouse
and rat (alignments in the additional files 2 and 3). The
insertion of this element in primates may account for the
reduced NF-κB activity of this site, as the insertion of
transposable elements is an important evolutionary
mechanism that can affect gene regulation [26]. Func-

tional experiments and analysis of available sequences
from more species will give us more data to test this
hypothesis. In this regard, it should be mentioned that
pathogens, as expected, have exerted a significant evolutionary pressure on NOS-2 inducibility, at least in mammalian macrophages. Although some controversy still
persists [27-30], in vivo data demonstrate that non-rodent
species display functional NOS-2 expression after infection with a wide array of pathogens. The relevant issue is
the unusual deviation in the upstream region of rodent
NOS-2 orthologues vs. other mammalian species. Solely
evolutionary distances cannot explain this divergence
since the same region is well-conserved in the more distant dog and horse orthologues. Availability of more
NOS-2 upstream sequences from mammalian species
might contribute to understand the evolutionary pressure
exerted by pathogens.
MultiTF was a very powerful tool for this analysis because
it can search common TFBSs in alignments of more than
two sequences, and it allowed us to use TRANSFAC matrices and a consensus sequence defined by ourselves. However, bioinformatic discovery of putative TFBSs based on
weight matrices (such as those in the TRANSFAC database) have serious drawbacks [31]. Attempts to minimize
false positives and the use "high quality" matrices can fail
to identify sites that have been experimentally demonstrated, as was the case with our analysis of the NOS-2
promoter. Indeed, phylogenetic footprinting of humanrodent alignments showed an acceptable degree of confidence [32] that is not the case for the NOS-2 promoter.
Given these limitations, bioinformatic analysis of promoters needs to be complemented with functional data
from wet-lab work. Even for very well known promoters,
such as those studied in this paper, the functional data
available for these types of studies is scarce. The results
presented here represent a first basic approach to the study
of vertebrate evolution of NF-κB regulated genes.

Conclusion
The analysis of the promoter sequences of these inducible
genes reveal differences in the degree of conservation,
with NOS-2 showing divergence between rodents and
other mammals in the location and functionality of conserved regions containing putative κB and IFN-γ elements.
These data that are in agreement with the refractoriness in
the induction of NOS-2 in primates and other non-rodent
species.

Sequences of NOS-2 (NOS2A) were obtained from
EnsEMBL [33]. The human gene sequence was downloaded from the Human Genome, and the NOS-2 orthologues in other species were directly selected from the

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:271

Human GeneView page. In all cases, we examined the 10
kb region upstream from TSS at base +1 and the 1 kb
downstream of this position. The EnsEMBL gene identities and chromosome positions sequence are listed in the
additional data file 3. Sequences were obtained from
EnsEMBL v22.1, except for dog sequences (v27.1 –
Dec2004) and macaque and cow (v36 – Dec2005).
EnsEMBL gene discrepancies: The rat NOS-2 5'-UTR was
not annotated in EnsEMBL, but we used the TSS described
[34]. The start of transcription of mouse NOS-2 in
EnsEMBL is 25 bp upstream with respect to the one first
published [11,35]; it should be noted that although this
site has been widely used in the literature, we used the TSS
given for the EnsEMBL gene (ENSMUSG00000020826).
Dog NOS-2 is only annotated in EnsEMBL as a fragment,
and the exact transcription start site is uncertain (there are
differences in the 5' end between NP_001003186 [GenBank:NP_001003186] and the genomic sequence in
EnsEMBL (data not shown). We decided to position the
dog NOS-2 +1 site further upstream than in the annotated
gene in EnsEMBL. The same decision was made with
macaque NOS-2. These decisions were based on the high
genomic sequence similarity between dog (and macaque)
sequence in this region and the start site of the human
NOS-2 gene. The dog and macaque NOS-2 base positions
are therefore only estimates; there are no experimental
data on the dog or rhesus monkey NOS-2 promoter, and
all results from these sequences presented in this work
should be considered as a tentative approximation based
on sequence comparison.
Sequence alignment methods
We compared the different promoters with MEME [36],
AVID at mVISTA [37-39], BlastZ with zPICTURE [40], and
Mulan [41]. Mulan is based in the tba method [42]. We
masked repetitive elements with RepeatMasker (A.F.A.
Smit & P. Green, unpublished data, [43]) with the Mulan
default settings, and we also used these masked sequences
with all other methods. For clarity, we used the human
sequence as the reference in AVID/mVISTA, zPICTURE
and Mulan. The following settings were established in the
analysis. MEME: one occurrence of a single motif per
sequence among all sequences; motifs between 6 and 120
bp, 10 motifs to find. mVISTA: window length 90 bp, 65%
minimum similarity. zPICTURE and Mulan: evolutionary
conserved region (ECR) length 90 bp, 65% minimum
similarity.
Evolutionary analysis of the NOS-2 promoter
Calculation of the pairwise evolutionary distances
between species was done for each one of the sequences
(intron, enhancer an proximal promoter) by means of the
Tajima-Nei method [44] using MEGA 3.1 program [45].
For each one of the sequences analysed, distances were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/271

transformed into branch lengths in a star-like unrooted
tree by means of the following equation [46]: La = (Dab +
Dac - Dbc)/2, where La is the length of the branch from
the common ancestor leading to a and Dab, Dac, Dbc are
the distances between species a and b, a and c, and b and
c, respectively. Two alternative unrooted trees (trios of
species) were considered: 1- human (H), mouse (M) and
cow (C) and 2- macaque (Mc), rat (R) and dog (D). Since
two of the species belongs to the same monophyletic
group in both trees (primates and rodents), the internal
node represents to the same common ancestor in both
diagrams and consequently, branch lengths can be compared between sequences within species. It is important to
emphasize that we are not considering that the phylogenetic relationships of these species is a star topology. We
used this exact equation for determining the branch
lengths of the three species, because the unique way to
arrange three species in a phylogenetic tree is a star topology.
TFBSs prediction
Match [47] was used, with false positives minimized with
TRANSFAC Professional 8.2. MutiTF is integrated in
Mulan [41], and uses an older version of TRANSFAC Professional 7.3. We used the default settings (optimized for
function) with TRANSFAC matrices. NFKB-NOS2 consensus site was obtained from the alignment of all known
functional κB sites in NOS-2 promoters of human, rat and
mouse: GGRDNNNYYY.
Protein extracts and EMSAs
Murine peritoneal macrophages were treated with 200 ng/
ml of LPS for 1 h. Nuclear extracts and EMSAs were prepared as previously described [48]. The oligonucleotide
sequences for binding were the following. Mouse -103 κB
