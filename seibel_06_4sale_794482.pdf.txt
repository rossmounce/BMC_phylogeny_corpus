Abstract
Background: In sequence analysis the multiple alignment builds the fundament of all proceeding
analyses. Errors in an alignment could strongly influence all succeeding analyses and therefore could
lead to wrong predictions. Hand-crafted and hand-improved alignments are necessary and
meanwhile good common practice. For RNA sequences often the primary sequence as well as a
secondary structure consensus is well known, e.g., the cloverleaf structure of the t-RNA. Recently,
some alignment editors are proposed that are able to include and model both kinds of information.
However, with the advent of a large amount of reliable RNA sequences together with their solved
secondary structures (available from e.g. the ITS2 Database), we are faced with the problem to
handle sequences and their associated secondary structures synchronously.
Results: 4SALE fills this gap. The application allows a fast sequence and synchronous secondary
structure alignment for large data sets and for the first time synchronous manual editing of aligned
sequences and their secondary structures. This study describes an algorithm for the synchronous
alignment of sequences and their associated secondary structures as well as the main features of
4SALE used for further analyses and editing. 4SALE builds an optimal and unique starting point for
every RNA sequence and structure analysis.
Conclusion: 4SALE, which provides an user-friendly and intuitive interface, is a comprehensive
toolbox for RNA analysis based on sequence and secondary structure information. The program
connects sequence and structure databases like the ITS2 Database to phylogeny programs as for
example the CBCAnalyzer. 4SALE is written in JAVA and therefore platform independent. The
software is freely available and distributed from the website at http://4sale.bioapps.biozentrum.uniwuerzburg.de

Background
Since multiple sequence alignments are the basis of many
analyses, for example in phylogenetics or in analysing

functional protein domains, there is a need for programs
to create and improve those alignments. Currently, several
programs are available to fulfil these necessities, e.g.,

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:498

CLUSTAL W [1], MUSCLE [2], DiAlign [3], T-Coffee [4] or
DCA [5] all of which are able to align multiple sequences
globally. The underlying methods have their strengths
and weaknesses, and resulting alignments can diverge
from the biologically correct ones. Editors like JalView [6],
SEAVIEW [7], CINEMA [8] or Align [9] are needed to
enhance the results by hand.
The just mentioned tools are based on sequence information only, but in RNA sequence analyses there is often also
structural information available. Databases like the ITS2
Database [10-12] provide a growing number of sequences
and their known secondary structures, as a prerequisite for
constructing RNA alignments for inferring phylogenies,
which of course is a precondition to understand the evolution of such RNA secondary structures [12].
All available methods that include structural information
to build RNA sequence alignments have a very high complexity. Rfam [13] provides a method to compare a single
nucleotide query sequence to handcurated alignments of
non-coding RNA families with annotated consensus secondary structures. MARNA [14] and RNAforester [15] can
be used to build global multiple alignments based on
sequence and simultaneously on secondary structure
information. However, the amount of sequences and/or
sequence lengths is limited due to the complexity of their
underlying algorithms, which is at least O(N3).
In current alignment editors like RALEE [16], DCSE [17]
or jPHYDIT [18] secondary structure information support
is very limited. While RALEE relys on the consensus structure only, jPHYDIT just shows the pairing information of
the selected sequence. Another RNA alignment editor
called SARSE has become available recently and focuses
on detection and editing of structural groups in RNA families [19]. So there is no editor available to align both,
sequence and secondary structure information of every
single RNA sequence simultaneously.

Implementation
4SALE is entirely written in JAVA, which enables to execute the software on any platform with a JAVA 5.0 virtual
machine available. The application consists of two parts,
the alignment algorithm, which is based on standard protein alignment algorithms, and the graphical editor frontend. For sequence and secondary structure alignments
running on the local machine 4SALE takes use of CLUSTAL W [1], so the binary is required to be installed.
Integration of different multiple alignment tools is realised by using SOAP based WebServices. Here, we take use
of RNAforester [15], CLUSTAL W [1], DCA [5] or DiAlign
[3]. The DiAlign and DCA WebServices currently support
sequence alignments without secondary structure infor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/498

mation only. The WebService technology enables the user
to run the tasks on remote machines. Therefore, it is possible to use 4SALE without restriction of any kind during
the calculation of the alignment. All WebServices require
an internet connection.

Results
Supported data
For RNA sequence and secondary structure alignment and
editing, 4SALE reads Vienna style DotBracket [20] formatted files. The ITS2 Database [10-12] represents a good
source for these kind of data. In addition we provide direct
access to the ITS2 Database from within 4SALE through
the ITS2 SOAP interface [10]. While RNA sequence information only is supported via the standard FASTA format,
alignment data can be loaded using the Clustal [1]
importer. Furthermore 4SALE handles XML based RNA
formats namely RNAStructML and RNAStructAlignmentML [21].
Standard features
In addition to the secondary structure based functionality,
4SALE integrates many useful features, that are known
from other alignment editors/programs. This includes
selecting multiple sections of an alignment to highlight
interesting regions and temporarily hide sequences to
focus on a subset of the alignment. Sequence-motifs,
including those, which are based on sequence and secondary structure information, can easily be highlighted by
pattern matching. Alignment column conservation based
on sequence information is visualized by either sequence
logos [22] or simply by bars on top of each column. Further importing, exporting and deleting sequences is possible by using the sequence names' context menu.
Additionally sequences can be reordered with the help of
the "Rearrange Sequences" window.
Algorithm
Beside the integration of RNAforester [15] we developed
an algorithm that uses the secondary structure information of every single sequence to align multiple RNA
sequences. This algorihm inherits the complexity of those
based on sequence information only. We achieve this by
mapping the sequence and secondary structure information of every single RNA sequence to artificial protein
sequences. The algorithm can be described as string alignment on a 12 letter alphabet comprised of the 4 nucleotides in three structural states (unpaired, paired left,
paired right). Horizontal dependencies given by the
sequence bindings are not modeled by this approach. To
align the string we use common alignment programs, like
CLUSTAL W [1] with a suitable scoring matrix. There are
several substitution models for this kind of scoring matrices discussed [23,24], we used a model as described by
[25,26]. The model is based on subsitutions that were

extracted from ITS2 sequence and secondary structure
alignments (Fig. 1). Those sequences and their associated
secondary structures were obtained from the ITS2 Database [10-12].
Synchronous editing
One of the main features of 4SALE is synchronizing the
sequence and secondary structure alignment, that is, every
operation on the sequence alignment is also performed
on the secondary structure alignment and vice versa.
Alignment editing in general works like in most alignment editors by using the space key to insert and the backspace key to remove gaps.

Block editing
As an effect of not using horizontal dependencies in our
greedy sequence and secondary structure alignment algorithm, there are often misaligned "blocks" in the result of
CLUSTAL W [1]. As shown in Fig. 2e the alignment could
be improved very fast, by using the block editing feature
in 4SALE.
Cursors
To make editing as convenient as possible, we provide different edit cursors. Beside the standard cursor, that
behaves as you expect from text editors for example, we
have an exclusive cursor, which performs the edit opera-

tion on every sequence but the selected ones. The leftside
cursor (c.f. [9]) allows edit operations only at the beginning of the sequence. As mentioned above all cursors perform synchronously on sequences and their secondary
structures.
Working with secondary structures
As current predictions of secondary structure information
is not highly reliable, performing changes to correct the
secondary structures is often needed.
Adding secondary structure information
4SALE supports two methods to add secondary structure
information to RNA sequences. First, by using the remote
folding feature to call the RNAfold WebService provided

by the University of Bielefeld (Germany), or manually
adding secondary structures by using the secondary structure editing feature.
Secondary structure editing
The secondary structure editing mode available in 4SALE
allows easy modification of the secondary structure information. It is context sensitive, which means it uses
sequence and secondary structure information to validate
whether a binding in this context is possible or not. Furthermore, it supports column based editing by holding
the control key. This enables insertion and deletion of
equivalent bindings in all sequences. In this case bindings
are only added to sequences allowing this binding (same
with deletions).

Secondary structure inspector
A secondary structure inspector allows to view and select
specific helical regions in secondary structures of loaded
sequences. The inspector consists of two parts; the upper
part shows a consensus of all secondary structures, the
lower part shows all secondary structures separately. The
secondary structure consensus is calculated not only on
column conservation, but also with respect of horizontal
dependencies, so the result is a valid secondary structure.
The conservation threshold can be modified using the
slider above.

Selecting an element in the inspector highlights the corresponding part in the alignment view. As shown in Fig. 3,
the inspector simplifies visualizing misaligned sequences.
"Masking" the sequence alignment based on the current
consensus structure is also possible. The result is shown in
a new window, which contains the alignment based on
sequence information only. The alignment can be processed like any other sequence alignment loaded in 4SALE.
This is particularly useful for calculating phylogenetic
trees based on the collective helical regions in the
sequence alignment.
Analyzing compensatory base changes
Compensatory base changes (CBC) occur when both
nucleotides of a paired site mutate while the pairing itself
stays stable. CBC analysis is important in detecting species
that are discriminated by their sexual incompatibility [2730]. We provide an easy-to-use CBC analysis mechanism

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/498

with the ability to calculate CBC matrices on the current
sequence and secondary structure based alignment. The
numbers in the CBC matrix are the counts of compensatory base changes in a pairwise sequence structure alignment, which are naturally given in the considered
multiple sequence structure alignment. A CBC-window in
4SALE (Fig. 2c) allows to select CBC counts between two
sequences and highlights directly all CBCs within the
alignment, giving an overview of all CBCs in the aligned
sequences.
Output & connection to other tools
For further analyses we provide several output formats.
Calculated CBC matrices can be saved as comma/tab
seperated values to be used in CBCAnalyzer [27]. CBCTree
(as implemented in CBCAnalyzer) can be used to calculate phylogenetic trees based on a CBC count matrix. At
present, no program is available to handle alignment outputs that include sequences and their individual secondary structures. However, for viewing purposes and
publication we support a MARNA-like [14] output.
Sequence alignments optimized by structural information
could, of course, be saved separately. For phylogenetic
analyses here we support the PHYLIP [31,32] formats.
Other tools that rely on multiple alignments are supported by FASTA.

Discussion
4SALE is the first alignment editor which allows synchronous editing of sequences and their corresponding sec-

Synchronous editing. This figure illustrates the synchronous sequence and secondary structure handling in 4SALE. When
selecting a helical region in the secondary structure alignment, as shown in this example, 4SALE synchronously selects its structural counterpart and its corresponding parts in the sequence alignment. The figure also shows very well, how easily an error
in the alignment could be detected and corrected by using the selection and edit features in 4SALE.

alignment and editing it contains many features using the
secondary structure information, e.g., the secondary structure inspector. All current standard alignment editors can

Acknowledgements
By using standard greedy protein alignment algorithms
we inherit their time efficiency. In contrast to, e.g.,
MARNA [14] or RNAforester [15], the time complexity of
calculation grows not rapidly with large files. We present
a completely new approach using nucleotides and every
single secondary structure for building and improving
RNA sequence alignments in comparison to others, which
just take the consensus structure information.

Special thanks go to Jan Krüger and Sven Hartmeier (both University of
Bielefeld, Germany) for their great help with integrating the WebServices
into 4SALE. Furthermore, we thank Andreas Pokorny and Joachim Friedrich (both University of Würzburg, Germany) for fruitful discussions and

der Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft Deutscher Forschungszentren e.V." (HOBIT

The structure output converted to Vienna style DotBracket
can be created from any desired RNA folding program,
e.g., RNAfold, Mfold [33] or RNAStructure [34]. It is then
aligned by using a suitable substitution matrix, which in
our case is based on information of the ITS2 Database.

Due to the natural limitation that two structures can be
hidden in one sequence, in general only one will be considered by our approach.

A future version of 4SALE will integrate in addition to
RNAforester [15] more real structural alignment methods
as WebServices via the SOAP interface. Also secondary
structure prediction algorithms as an alternative to RNAfold will be included. Furthermore, more visualizations
like secondary structure drawings can be implemented.

4SALE is easy to use and has a fast (<O(N3)) and good
heuristic to globally align multiple RNA sequences and
their associated secondary structures simultaneously.
