Abstract
Human polyomavirus BK (BKV) has been implicated in oncogenic transformation. Its ability to
replicate is determined by the binding of its large tumor antigen (LTag) to products of tumorsuppressor genes regulating cell cycle, as specifically p53. We investigated CD8+ T immune
responses to BKV LTag portions involved in p53 binding in HLA-A*0201+ BKV LTag experienced
individuals.
Peptides selected from either p53-binding region (LTag351–450 and LTag533–626) by current
algorithms and capacity to bind HLA-A*0201 molecule were used to stimulate CD8+ T responses,
as assessed by IFN-γ gene expression ex vivo and detected by cytotoxicity assays following in vitro
culture.
We observed epitope-specific immune responses in all HLA-A*0201+ BKV LTag experienced
individuals tested. At least one epitope, LTag579–587; LLLIWFRPV, was naturally processed in non
professional antigen presenting cells and induced cytotoxic responses with CTL precursor
frequencies in the order of 1/20'000. Antigen specific CD8+ T cells were only detectable in the
CD45RA+ subset, in both CCR7+ and CCR7- subpopulations.
These data indicate that widespread cellular immune responses against epitopes within BKV LTagp53 binding regions exist and question their roles in immunosurveillance against tumors possibly
associated with BKV infection.

Background
Human polyomavirus BK (BKV) is a DNA virus belonging
to the Polyomaviridae family that also includes human
polyomavirus JC (JCV), and Simian virus 40 (SV40)
(International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses
(ICVD))[1]. The virus is ubiquitous in the human population, establishing latent infections in the kidney and the
urogenital tract[2]. Spontaneous reactivation and lowlevel replication with shedding into urines is observed in
5–20% of healthy individuals[3]. Serological evidence
indicates that nearly 90% of individuals are infected by
early childhood, although a decrease in this rate during
the human lifespan may be due to viral seroconversion
(70–80%) [4,5]. Usually, polyomaviruses cause persistent
subclinical infections in humans and BKV infection rarely
leads to clinical manifestations. However, when the
immune system is compromised, as following transplantation, HIV infection, chemotherapy or pharmacologic
immunosuppression, rate and level of BKV replication
increase and may lead to organ diseases[6]. The polyomavirus genome consists of the non-coding control region,
the early genes and the late genes. The polyomavirusencoded early gene product large tumor antigen (LTag)
has been identified early on as a key regulatory molecule[7]. LTag interacts with a number of host cell molecules
including
the
tumor-suppressor
gene
retinoblastoma family (Rb) products and p53. Initially,
the LTag binds to products of the Rb-family (pRb, p107,
and p130) thereby interfering with their activity and
inducing the infected cell to enter the cell cycle (phase S).
Subsequently, and most importantly, the LTag inactivation of p53 allows the re-phosphorylation of pRb through
the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) pathway and prevents
the p53-mediated cell apoptosis of infected cell[8].
This mechanism is used by the virus to keep the infected
cells alive during productive infection but in non-permissive cells it may lead to cell transformation[9]. In fact,
abortive replication may result in oncogenic transformation which has rendered polyomaviruses prototypes of
DNA tumor virus well amenable to studies in experimental models. Indeed, p53 mutations and overall inactivation have been implicated in tumor progression.
The role of human polyomaviruses in human cancer is
still debated. Recent investigations have associated them
with the outgrowth of specific cancer types including
colorectal cancer[10,11], glioblastomas[12,13], mesotheliomas[14], prostate cancer[15] and, possibly, lymphomas[16,17].
Since LTag mediated inactivation of p53 has been suggested to represent a critical step for viral oncogenicity[18,19], this antigen has been identified as an
important target of cancer immunity in murine mod-

http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/4/1/47

els[20]. The involvement of BKV LTag in the alteration of
critical pathways of the human cell cycle together with the
detection of LTag-p53 complexes by immunohistochemical analysis of normal and pathological specimens[15],
prompted us to investigate the role of this viral antigen as
target of cellular immune surveillance. The specific aim of
this study was to evaluate in HLA-A*0201+ BKV LTag
experienced donors immune responsiveness to candidate
epitopes from portions of the LTag specifically expressed
in long lasting infected cells and possibly playing a role in
BKV mediated oncogenisis.

Materials and methods
Large Tag selection and peptide synthesis
The LTag sequence used in this study was selected by comparing 15 BKV LTag sequences available on the net[21]
sharing a homology between 97 to 100% as detectable by
using BLAST search[22]. Two major peptide-algorithms,
BIMAS[23] and SYFPHEITI[24] were employed to list candidate immune dominant epitopes from LTag. A standardization of peptides' scores was applied to identify best
binders according to their final values using the following
formula: zi = [(xi-µ) σ] [25]

Four peptides were used as positive or negative controls:
the HLA-A*0201-restricted vaccinia virus H3L peptide184–
192 (SLSAYIIRV)[26], the HLA-A*0201-restricted MelanA/
the
HLA-A*2402Mart126–35 (ELAGIGILTV)[27],
restricted CMV pp65341–350 (QYDPVALLFF) [28,29] and
the HLA-A*0201-restricted CMV pp65495–503 (NLVPMVATV) [30]. Peptides were synthesized by Princeton Biomolecules (Langhorne, PA) with purity from 90 to 100%
as analyzed by HPLC, dissolved in 100% DMSO and
stored at -70°C until use.
Peptide binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 processing
defective T2 cells
HLA-A*0201+ human antigen processing defective T2
cells were diluted in PBS at a concentration of 2 × 106
cells/ml and were distributed in 96-well U bottom plates
(100 µl total) in the presence or absence of peptides at a
250 µg/ml concentration. Plates were subsequently incubated for 16 hours at 37°C in humidified air containing
5% CO2. Cells were stained with FITC-tagged antibodies
against human HLA-A*0201 (BD, Bioscience, San Jose,
CA) and samples were analyzed by FACS. The fluorescence index (FI) was calculated by the following formula:
(mean fluorescence experimental sample-mean fluorescence background)/mean fluorescence background).
Results were reported in logarithmic scale with a 2-fold
increase cut-off based on the fluorescence intensity in the
presence of the irrelevant peptide HLA-A*2402-restricted
CMV pp65341–350.

Donor selection and serology
Upon informed consent, HLA-A*0201+ Caucasians
(mean age: 36.8 ± 7.6) were selected for this study. Detection of BKV-specific Ab (IgG) in donor sera was performed
by ELISA using recombinant LTag and capsid protein 1
(VP1) purified from baculovirus expression system
(H.H.H. and R. G., unpublished data). Briefly, the N-terminal part of LTag overlapping with the small T-antigen
was expressed as a Glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-fusion
protein in SF9-insect cells and purified by gluthathionesepharose affinity chromatography. The fusion proteins
and GST were coated on microtiter plates according to
standard procedures. Sera were diluted 1:400 and tested
in duplicates at room temperature. After washing 5 times
with PBS, peroxidase labeled goat anti-human IgG
(1:10'000 dilution in PBS) were added for 30 min before
extra washing (5 times with PBS). O-phenyldiamine (0.4
mg/L) was added as substrate for 30 min in the dark. The
reaction was stopped with H2O2 and the OD450 nm was
read. Reactive sera were defined by OD readings above
background subtracted of GST+2SD.
Peptide ex vivo induction and qrt-PCR analysis
Ex vivo induction of peptide-specific responses was
attempted as follows. Briefly, PBMCs isolated from
venous blood by Ficoll gradient centrifugation (Ficollhypaque density gradient), were incubated in 96 U bottom well plates at the concentration of 2 × 105 cells in 200
µl total RPMI medium supplemented with 100 µg/mL
Kanamycin, 10 mM Hepes, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1 mM
Glutamax and nonessential amino acids (all from GIBCO
Paisley, Scotland) thereafter referred to as complete
medium and 5% human serum (Blutspendezentrum,
Kantonsspital Basel, Switzerland). After an overnight resting, cells were both peptide-stimulated (1 µM) or left
unstimulated and 3 hours after they were harvested for
RNA extraction (RNeasy® Mini Kit Protocol, Qiagen, Basel,
Switzerland) and cDNA synthesis (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). Quantitative real-time PCR (qrt-PCR) assays were
performed as previously described [31] and conducted on
an ABI prism™ 7500 FAST sequence detection system
using TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix Reagents Kit
(Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) and sets of
primers and probes from cytokine genes (IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4,
and IL-10) already extensively utilized[28]. Beta actin (βactin) was used as endogenous reference gene. Normalized data were subsequently presented as relative quantification. The 2-∆∆Ct method [∆∆CT = (CT, cytokine – CT,βactin)induction – (CT, cytokine – CT,β-actin)baseline, where CT is
the mean cycle times of the triplicate well readings] was
utilized to compute the fold change of cytokine gene
expression after peptide induction relative to baseline
(unstimulated cells), normalized to an endogenous reference gene (β-actin)[32].

Cell collection and culture
Subpopulations of cells (CD14+, CD8+, CD45RA+) were
either positively or negatively purified from freshly isolated PBMCs by MACS (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) according to producers' protocols and in
relation to different experimental procedures. For dendritic cell (DC) generation, isolated CD14+ were cultured
for 5 to 7days in complete medium supplemented with
10% FCS (GIBCO Paisley, Scotland), β-mercaptoethanol
0.004%, recombinant human IL-4 (1000 UI/mL, courtesy
of Dr. Lanzavecchia, Bellinzona, Switzerland) and recombinant human GM-CSF (50 ng/mL, Laboratorio Pablo
Cassara', Buenos Aires, Argentina) to generate immature
DC (iDCs). Maturation of iDCs was induced by exposure
to lipopolysaccaride (Abortus Aequi, Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) at a concentration of 1 µg/mL. Both whole
CD8+ and CD45RA+ purified T cells were subsequently
plated in complete medium supplemented with 5%
human serum in either 96-well U bottom or 24-well
plates for in vitro inductions at various concentrations
and time exposures. Mature peptide-loaded DCs (mDCs)
were used as APC either for priming or for rounds of restimulations. Recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2) was
administered to the cultures at different concentrations
according to experimental procedures.
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vitro expansion and
cytotoxicity assay
CD8+ T cells purified from PBMCs of healthy donors
(106/mL) were primed with irradiated (30 Gy) autologous
mDCs (2 × 105/mL) previously loaded for 2 hours with
peptide at a final concentration of 5 µg/mL. On days7 and
14 cultures were restimulated with peptide loaded mDCs.
During the in vitro induction the cells were supplemented
every other day with rhIL-2 at the final concentration of
20 UI/mL. Cytotoxic activity was tested on day 21 by using
a 4-hrs chromium release assay on T2 cells previously
labeled with 51Cr (50 µCi of 51Cr for 1 h at 37°C) and
pulsed for 2hours with cognate or control peptides at a
concentration of 2.5 µg/mL in triplicate wells. Specific
lysis of target cells was calculated according to the standard formula: 100 × [(cpm experimental release - cpm
spontaneous release)/(cpm maximal release - cpm spontaneous release)]. Following testing, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were expanded by repeated
restimulations to generate epitope-specific CTL lines
which were used to test functional activities and to analyse
natural processing of defined peptides.
Limiting dilution analysis (LDA)
CD8+ T cells were cultured in 96-well plates according to
the same conditions as outlined above at 10'000, 5'000
and 2'500 cells/well for total of 32 wells for each concentration. Autologous mDCs were pulsed with peptides,
irradiated and used as APC at a final concentration of

2'500 cells/well. On day 7 cells were re-stimulated following the same procedure. On day 3 and day 10, rhIL-2 was
administered to cultures at a concentration of 20 UI/ml
and 100 UI/ml, respectively. Cytotoxic activity was tested
on day 14 against peptide pulsed 51Cr-labeled T2 cells, as
reported above. Cytotoxic T cell precursor (CTLp) frequencies were evaluated as previously described[33].
Wells were considered positive when their cytolysis
exceeded 3 standard deviations and at least 12% above
average values of negative control lysis. On the basis of the
single-hit Poisson model, the frequency of antigen specific
CTLp's was estimated from the initial responder cell
number at which 37% of the wells were negative for cytotoxicity.
Plasmid generation and transfection of HLA-A*0201 target
cells
In plasmid DNA pTRE2LTag, the cDNA coding sequence
of LTag of BKV is under control of a tetracycline-controlled transactivator-dependent promoter. The intron of the
LTag was removed by 'gene splicing' by overlap extension[34]. Two DNA fragments were generated by PCR
using primer pairs 1 -2: (1) 5'-GAGAGAGCTAGCCACCATGGATAAAGTTCTTAACAGGGAAGA-3'
(2)
5'TTCTGTTCCATAGGTTGGCACCTCTGAGCTACTCCAGGTTCC-3' and 3–4: (3) 5'-GGAACCTGGAGTAGCTCAGAGGTGCCAACCTATGGAACAGAA-3'
(4)
5'GAGAGAATCGATTATTTTGGGGGTGGTGTTTTAGG-3'
on DNA extracted from BKV-positive urine as template.
The two DNA fragments were subsequently joined in a
PCR reaction containing primer pair 1–4. The amplification product was digested with ClaI and NheI, followed by
ligation into ClaI-NheI digested pTRE2pur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The integrity of plasmid DNA was
verified by automated sequencing on a Beckman CEQ
8000 (Beckman Coulter Inc. Fullerton, CA).

The metastatic melanoma HBL cell line expressing HLAA*0201 molecule were selected for pTRE2LTag transfection. Cells were routinely passaged in conventional cultures in complete medium supplemented with 10% heatinactivated FCS. Transfection of HBL cells was performed
by liposome-mediated gene transfer in 6 or 12-well plates.
Cells at 90–95% confluency were transfected with a plasmid DNA (1.6 and 3.2 µg) to Lipofectamine 2000 (2 and
3 µl) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) ratio of 1.06 according to
the manufacturer's recommendations. For transfection,
pTRE2LTag and pTet-Off (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA)
were mixed at a ratio of 1:1. At 24 hours post transfection,
the cells were transferred into T75 culture flasks. To determine the peak of protein expression, a variant of wild-type
green fluorescent protein plasmid (pEGFP-N1; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) was transfected into parallel cell
cultures and the enhanced green fluorescent protein
(EGFP) expression was monitored by fluorescence micro-

scopy at 24 and 48 hours post transfection. The LTag gene
expression was measured by qrt-PCR using the following
primers and probe[15]:
Forward: 5'-TTTTGGAACCTGGAGTAGCTCAGAGGTTT3'
Reverse: 5'-GCTTGACTAAGAAACTGGTGTAGAT-3'
Probe:
5'-TTGAGTGTTGAGAATCTGCTGTTGCTTCTTCATCACTGGCAAACA-3'
Standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
Release of IFN-γ protein by either in vitro sensitized
PBMCs after peptide re-stimulation or expanded CTLs cultured with pTRE2LTag BKV tranfected targets was measured using an ELISA kit (Endogen, Woburn, MA) on
culture supernatants collected 18 hours after the last
induction. ELISA results were extrapolated from a standard curve generated by linear regression. All assays were
performed in duplicate and results were reported as average values.
Cell phenotype and multimer staining analysis
HLA-A*0201 MHC Pro5™ PE-labeled pentamers for
LTag579–587, LTag406–414 and Melan-A/MART-126–35
(ProImmune, UK) were used for surface staining of the
cells under investigation. Samples were analyzed on a
FACSCalibur flow-cytometer equipped with Cellquest
software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Cells were first
stained with 1 µl MHC PE-labeled pentamer for 15 min at
4°C in the dark. Subsequently, they were washed once
and stained with 5 µl of CD8-PE-Cy7, CCR7-APC and
CD45RA-FITC (BD, Bioscience, San Jose, CA) for 30 min
at 4°C (on ice) in the dark. After staining, cells were
washed twice and immediately analyzed on a flow cytometer or fixed in 200 µl 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS solution, kept at 4°C in the dark and analyzed later.

Results
Prediction of HLA-A*0201-restricted T cell epitopes within
BKV LTag
BIMAS and SYFPEITHI algorithm programs were used to
select HLA-A*0201 binding nonamer peptides from BKV
LTag. An unbiased search was performed focusing in particular on p53-binding regions of LTag. Standardization
of algorithm-scores[25] led to the final selection of 14
peptides out of a total of 250 sorted by the programs (Tab
1). Among the 14 peptides selected, 6 were nested within
the LTag p53-binding domain 351–450 (LTag351–450) and
3 within the LTag p53-binding domain 533–626
(LTag533–626). No peptide was selected within the LTag
p300-binding domain 1–82 (LTag1–82) and the LTag pRb(p107-) binding domain 101–118 (LTag101–118). The
remaining 5 peptides were randomly nested within LTag

regions not presumed to be directly involved in the regulation of the cell cycle (Tab 2 and Tab 3)[35].
To validate algorithm predictions, we performed a HLAA*0201 T2 binding assays to evaluate the ability of individual peptides within LTag351–450 and LTag533–626
regions to stably interact with HLA-A*0201 determinants
over time (16 hours). HLA-A*2402 CMV pp65341–350
(QYDPVALLFF) was used as irrelevant negative control
peptide while vaccinia virus H3L184–192 peptide
(SLSAYIIRV) was used as positive control. Based on these
studies, four peptides within p53-binding region
LTag351–450 (LTag 398, 406, 410, and 436), two within
p53-binding region Tag533–626 (LTag 558 and 579) and
three from non p53-binding regions (LTag 157, 216 and
472) capable of increasing * 2-fold the HLA-A*0201 specific mean fluorescence intensity on T2 cultured in the
presence of the irrelevant negative control peptide were
identified (Figure 1A).
Ex vivo immune reactivation against HLA-A*0201+ BKV
LTag experienced donors
PBMCs were obtained from seven donors (A to G). Five of
them (B to F) were HLA-A*0201+ and showed evidence of
humoral response against BKV LTag. Donor A was HLAA*0201+ but BKV LTag seronegative (Figure 1B), while
donor G was HLA-A*0201 negative.

Cells were ex vivo stimulated with 1 µM of each of the 6
LTag p53-binding regions peptides selected upon combining algorithm data and T2 binding assays (LTag 398,
406, 410, 436, 558, and 579). The three peptides not
included in the p53-binding domains (LTag 157, 216, and
472) were also tested to investigate eventual immune
responses against determinants encompassed by BKV
LTag regions not presumably involved in the cell cycle.
Responsiveness was assessed by using qrt-PCR to evaluate

http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/4/1/47

fold increase of IFN-γ gene expression in peptide stimulated cultures as compared to unstimulated controls. A
threshold of 2-fold increase over the baseline was considered as a cut-off. LTag 579 induced the highest IFN-γ gene
expression in PBMCs from all the 5 HLA-A*0201+ BKV
LTag seropositive donors tested (donors B-F). Potential
immunogenicity of the p53 binding domain LTag533–626
was confirmed by the response induced by LTag 558 in
two of these donors. Ex vivo immune responses against
LTag 398, 406, and 410 peptides from p53 binding region
LTag351–450 were also detected in 4/5 donors. Furthermore, immune reactivation was also induced by LTag 157,
216, and 472 peptides, particularly in PBMCs from one of
the donors included in this group (donor C) (Figure 1C).
Importantly, LTag 436, while showing effective T2 binding, was unable to induce specific IFN-γ gene expression
in any of the donors under investigation. As expectable,
no responsiveness was detectable in cells from HLAA*0201+ donor A, seronegative for BKV LTag, nor in cells
from HLA-A*0201 negative donor G.
Epitope-specific cytotoxic activity by BKV LTag351–450 and
LTag533–626 in vitro expanded CD8+ T cells
A 3-week peptide-specific in vitro expansion was carried
out on isolated CD8+ T lymphocytes from the five HLAA*0201+ BKV LTag seropositive donors included in the
study (B through F). The eight candidate immunogenic
LTag derived peptides identified in the previous phase
were used for the induction of cytotoxic activity in CD8+
T cells from donors shown to be responsive in terms of
specific "ex vivo" IFN-γ gene expression upon cognate
peptide stimulation. 51Cr release cytotoxicity assays were
used as read-out.

LTag 579 peptide induced specific cytotoxic activity in
cells from 4/5 responders. LTag 406 did in 3/3, LTag 410
and LTag 157 in 1/2 each (Figure 2). In contrast, LTag 216,

LTag 398, LTag 472 and LTag 558, while inducing some
degree of specific IFN-γ gene expression "ex vivo", were
unable to stimulate the generation of peptide specific
cytotoxic activity.
To further validate the specific CTL response obtained
against the p53-binding regions LTag351–450 and Tag533–
626, we correlated the extent of "ex vivo" immune reactivation detected after a 3-hour peptide-induction and the
cytotoxic responses detectable upon a 3-week in vitro culture at a 50:1 E:T ratio. A highly significant correlation
between the extent of IFN-γ gene expression and the percent specific lysis elicited respectively by 3-hrs ex vivo and
3-week in vitro stimulated CD8+ T cells with all peptides
selected from all five HLA-A*0201+ BKV LTag seropositive responders tested was indeed observed (Pearson's R =
0.820, p = 0.0001, Figure 3A). Correlations were still
highly significant when responses against specific p53binding domains were analyzed individually (LTag351–450;
Pearson's R = 0.640, p = 0.003 and LTag533–626; Pearson's
R = 0.898, p = 0.02) (Figure 3B and 3C).

HLA-A*0201-restricted LTag 579 epitope is a naturally
processed immune determinant among p53-binding
regions LTag351–450 and LTag533–626
The melanoma cell line HBL expressing the HLA-A*0201
molecule was transfected with BKV LTag and used as target
to test the ability of specific epitopes to be naturally processed and presented in the context of the HLA-A*0201
restriction. The highest transgene expression efficiency
was achieved 48 hours after transfection, as suggested by
detection of EGFP by fluorescence microscopy (Figure
4A). The transient LTag expression after 48 hours was also
confirmed at the gene level with similar timing (Figure
4B).

LTag 579-expanded CTL lines previously tested for their
ability to lyse LTag 579-loaded T2 cells (90% to 97% at
50:1 E:T ratio; data not shown) were incubated at a 5:1 E:T
ratio with either LTag transfected or untransfected HBL
cells. The resulting antigen specific activation was evaluated after 3-hrs incubation as IFN-γ gene expression and
after 18-hrs incubation as IFN-γ protein release. A CMV
pp65495–503 CTL line generated from a CMV seropositive
subject was used as a control. Three out of five LTag 579expanded CTL lines tested expressed IFN-γ gene upon
stimulation by LTag transfected cells, although to a lower
extent as compared to induction by peptide loaded autologous APC. (Figure 4C). Two LTag 579-expanded CTL
lines consistently released the corresponding protein (Figure 4D). On the other hand, LTag 406 and 410 stimulated
CTLs failed to specifically recognize LTag tranfected targets, as detectable by IFN-γ gene expression and protein
production (data not shown).
Epitope-specific cytotoxic T cell precursor frequency for
the immunodominant determinant LTag 579 within BKV
LTag533–626
T cell precursor (CTLp) frequency for LTag 579 was then
evaluated in HLA-A*0201+ LTag BKV seropositive donors
by limiting dilution analysis (LDA), according to the Poisson distribution as described in "materials and methods".

HLA-A*0201 binding and immunostimulatory capacity of peptides from BKV LTag sequence
HLA-A*0201 binding and immunostimulatory capacity of peptides from BKV LTag sequence. Nonamer peptides
identified by standardized assessment of epitope finding algorithms within BKV LTag sequence were tested for MHC affinity by
T2 binding assay (panel A). Data are reported as average mean fluorescence intensities from three different experiments. Representative histograms obtained upon incubation of T2 cells in the presence of vaccinia H3L184–192 (positive control), pp65341–350
(irrelevant peptide) and LTag579–587 (LTag peptide best binder) are also shown. Panel B shows data related to BKV antigen specific serological response to both LTag and VP1 antigen in the group of donors included in the study. Panel C shows responsiveness of PBMCs from BKV LTag seropositive donors cultured in the presence of the indicated peptides. The capacity to
induce IFN-γ gene expression upon stimulation ex vivo was analysed by qrt-PCR. Results are depicted as IFN-γ relative gene
expression (relative quantification, 2-∆∆Ct method) as compared to unstimulated PBMCs and include data from all HLAA*0201+ BKV LTag seropositive donors tested (B to F), including both HLA-A*0201+ BKV LTag seronegative (donor A) and
HLA-A*0201 negative (donor G) controls. The results are representative of two independent experiments.

The LTag 579 specific CTLp frequency under cognate peptide stimulation, as detectable in two representative
donors, was of 1:13'000 and 1: 24'000 (Figure 5).
Ex vivo analysis of BKV LTag 579 specific T cell population
CD8+ T cell phenotype of LTag 579 epitope-specific cells
was then analysed ex vivo in three HLA-A*0201+ BKV
LTag seropositive and one HLA-A*0201+ BKV LTag seron-

egative donors. LTag 579-HLA multimer specific CD8+ T
cells frequency for HLA-A*0201+ BKV LTag seropositive
donors was of 0.23%, 0.59% and 0.41%, respectively.
Epitope specific CD8+ populations showed a prevailingly
CD45RA positivity consistent with a naïve CD45RA+,
CCR7+ phenotype and an effector-memory CD45RA+,
CCR7- phenotype (Figure 6A). The gene expression of
three cytokines implicated in the control of CD8+ T cell

Detection of CTL activity against epitopes from BKV LTag domains among HLA-A*0201+ healthy donors
Detection of CTL activity against epitopes from BKV LTag domains among HLA-A*0201+ healthy donors.
CD8+ T lymphocytes from five HLA-A*0201+ BKV LTag seropositive donors (B through F) were expanded in vitro for 3
weeks, upon weekly stimulation using autologous irradiated mDCs loaded with BKV LTag derived peptides selected by combining results from T2 binding and IFN-γ gene expression assays (≥ 2-fold, as compared to either irrelevant peptide or unstimulated cells). Cytotoxic activity was then tested against specific (squares) or control (diamonds) peptide-loaded targets. Specific
cytotoxicity values at 50:1 E:T ratio are also included in each panel. An overview of specific lysis for all peptides tested in all
BKV LTag seropositive responders at 50:1 E:T ratio is reported in the lower panel, where an arbitrary cut-off of 30% was
applied.

immune reactivity (IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10) was also studied
ex vivo. LTag 579 induced the expression of IL-2 in two
out of the three donors, whereas expression of IL-4 and IL10 was always negligible (Figure 6B).
Characterization of the T cell population stimulated by
BKV LTag 579
Prompted by these data, we then attempted a further characterization of LTag 579 specific HLA-A*0201-restricted
CTLs. CD8+ T cells were separated into CD45RA+ and
CD45RA- fractions prior to peptide stimulation. The HLA-

A*0201-restricted melanoma associated antigen MelanA/
Mart-126–35 peptide was used as control due to its ability
to prime and expand specific T cell with a prevailingly
CD45RA+ phenotype in healthy donors[36]. After a 3week induction by LTag 579 or MelanA/Mart-126–35 peptides, cells from the CD45RA+ fraction showed a high
cytotoxic activity against either epitope under investigation. Specific lysis (SL) was still detectable at a 3:1 E:T ratio
(MelanA/Mart-126–35 ∆SL3:1 = 32.06; LTag 579 ∆SL3:1 =
23.19). While low level MelanA/Mart-126–35 specific cytotoxic activity was still observed in stimulated cultures gen-

Correlation between cytokine gene expression and lytic activity in T cells stimulated by BKV LTag epitopes.
Panels display correlations between IFN-γ gene expression, reported as fold increase, as compared to unstimulated cells, and
specific cytotoxic activity as detectable upon 3-week in vitro culture at a 50:1 E:T ratio. Correlations were significant either
when overall responses to LTag epitopes were analyzed (Pearson's R = 0.820, p = 0.0001, panel A) or when responses to both
p53-binding domain LTag351–450 (Pearson's R = 0.640, p = 0.003, panel B) and LTag533–626 (Pearson's R = 0.898, p = 0.02, panel
C) were separately evaluated. These data firmly establish that the ability of discrete peptides to induce specific cytotoxicity can
be reliably predicted based on their degree of "ex vivo" stimulatory capacity regarding IFN-γ gene expression.

erated from CD45RA- CD8+ T cell (MelanA/Mart-126–
35∆SL12:1 = 28.17%), we were unable to generate CTL specific for LTag 579 from this cellular fraction (Figure 7A,
upper panel). FACS analysis conducted on MelanA/Mart126–35 (36.27%) and LTag 579 (20.91%) HLA-A*0201
specific multimers revealed that over 99% of specific
CD8+ T cells indeed displayed a late effector phenotype

Notably, IFN-γ protein release assays carried on supernatants of MelanA/Mart-126–35 or LTag 579 in vitro

immune responses were prevailingly inducible in the

shares a homology between 98 to 100% with both BK and
JC LTag in almost 100% of the strains analyzed. In particular, a single amino acid substitution in position 6 involving serine vs phenylalanine (Ser→Phe) was found in one
out of 15 BKV strains and in position 7 involving lysine vs
arginine (Lys→Arg) in one out of 155 JCV strains
screened. This homology decreases to about 70% in com-

parison to the SV40 large Tag since all the 13 SV40 strains
screened report substitutions in positions 2 involving
methionine vs leucine (Met→Leu) and position 6 involving tyrosine vs phenylalanine (Tyr→Phe). These amino
acid substitutions, however, may not directly affect the
potential peptide binding affinity to the HLA-A*0201
molecule (Table 4).

Frequency of LTag579–587 peptide-specific CTLp in
HLA-A*0201+ BKV LTag seropositive donors. Frequency of LTag 579 peptide-specific CTLp from two HLAA*0201+ BKV LTag seropositive donors was evaluated by
LDA, as detailed in "Materials and methods", taking advantage
of Poisson distribution analysis.

Most importantly, LTag 579 peptide showed no homology beyond LTag of polyomaviruses, thus indicating that
the strong immune responsiveness detected cannot be
attributed to cross-reactivities against unrelated highly
immunogenic determinants (data not shown)[37].

Discussion
Polyomavirus large tumor-antigen (LTag) interacts with a
number of host molecules involved with cell cycle, including the tumor-suppressor gene product p53 and has been
identified as an important target of cancer immunity in
murine models[38]. Early studies in SV40 infected mice
have reported on conserved CD8+ T cells immune
responses against SV40 LTag[39]. In humans, however,
despite continuous efforts aimed at identifying potential
HLA class I restricted LTag epitopes[40,41], an epitopespecific cytotoxic immune response against this antigens
or its portions is still poorly characterized [42,43].
Upon viral entry in non-permissive cells, in the context of
an abortive infection, viral DNA is fully integrated in the
host genome or resides in host cells as plasmid, thereby
favouring the persistence of the virus without production
of progeny virions[8]. Within these modalities of viruscell interaction, LTag is the most highly expressed BKV
antigen in non permissive infected cells and might
encompass viral epitopes generated by the endogenous
class I restricted antigen processing pathway and, possibly, targeted by specific CTL responses. Thus, the identification of LTag derived antigenic peptides might provide

HLA-class I restricted immune responses against defined
viral antigens can be frequently induced by ex vivo stimulation of peptide-specific T cells from seropositive subjects[45]. Taking advantage of well studied algorithms, in
this study we comprehensively analysed CTL responses
against BKV LTag-related epitopes in HLA-A*0201+ BKV
LTag experienced individuals. In particular, we focused on
antigen triggered cytokine gene expression and lytic capacity in BKV specific CTL.
A first important result of our study is represented by the
validation of a rapid, previously characterized[31], screening technology. Indeed, we found a highly significant correlation between IFN-γ gene expression induced by a 3hour stimulation of CD8+ T cells and the corresponding
epitope specific cytotoxic activity detectable following 2–
3 week cultures in the presence of peptides and IL-2.
Most interestingly, since antigen triggered cytokine gene
expression is detectable after a 3-hour culture only, it is
unlikely to be related to primary "in vitro" sensitization,
but rather to the stimulation of antigen experienced specific CD8+ T cells, present in the peripheral blood samples
under investigation[46]. Moreover, this pattern of epitope
immunorecognition "ex vivo" and following "in vitro"
culture was consistently reproducible in serial tests performed on cells from the same donors for over one year,
thus suggesting that these sustained responses are not
associated to specific phases of the host-virus interaction.
LTag 406, 410 and 579 emerged as the most immunogenic peptides among those studied. The latter appeared
to be naturally processed in non professional HLAA*0201 positive antigen presenting cells expressing LTag.
The relatively weak response detected following co-cultures of peptide specific expanded T cells with LTag transfected targets (only 3 of 5 cultures produced detectable
levels of IFN-γ following stimulation) could be ascribed
either to: i) low expression of LTag protein (in spite the
relevant production of LTag mRNA following transient
transfection) and subsequent impaired peptide-processing; or ii) T cell anergy due to the lack of professional antigen presenting cells (i.e. mDC).
Four out of five HLA-A*0201+ BKV LTag seropositive
donors responded to LTag 579 and LDA data indicate that

Phenotype and functions of LTag 579/HLA-A*0201 multimer-labeled specific T cells "ex vivo"
Phenotype and functions of LTag 579/HLA-A*0201 multimer-labeled specific T cells "ex vivo". PBMCs from
three HLA-A*0201+ BKV LTag seropositive and one HLA-A*0201+ BKV LTag seronegative donors were stained with LTag
579/HLA-A*0201-multimers and the ex vivo CD8+ T cell phenotype was analyzed. Panel A shows frequencies of specific LTag
579-HLA-A*0201 multimer positive cells plotted against CD8+ T cells: cells were considered positive if their mean fluorescence intensities exceeded by ten fold that of multimer negative CD8+ cells. LTag 579/HLA-A*0201+ cells were also evaluated
for their CD45RA and CCR7 surface expression. Panel B reports the expression of IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 genes by "ex vivo" peptide induced PBMCs from the same donors. Data are reported as fold increase of specific gene expression (relative quantification, 2-∆∆Ct method), as compared to unstimulated cultures.

the frequency of CTLp specific for this peptide may be
comparable to that of CTLp specific for the highly immunogenic HLA-A*0201-restricted influenza matrix 58–66
epitope (Michel Adamina, manuscript in preparation), as
detectable in seropositive individuals.
CTL specific for antigens from viruses responsible for persistent infections are frequently characterized by specific
phenotypic profiles. For instance, EBV or CMV specific
CTL responses are elicited by distinct subsets of memory T

lymphocytes reported as early effectors for EBV (CD45RA(+)/CCR7+) or late effectors for CMV (CD45RA+/CCR7)[47]. Our studies indicate that BKV LTag 579 specific CTL
responders exquisitely belong to a CD45RA+/CCR7+(-)
CD8+ T cell population. Indeed "ex vivo" studies clearly
demonstrate CD8+ T cells characterized by a relatively
dim positivity for LTag 579/HLA-A*0201 pentamers and
displaying this phenotypic profile in the peripheral blood
of BKV seropositive donors. In addition 2–3 week cultures
of separated cell populations indicate that specific CTL

BKV LTag 579 specific CD8+ T cells belong to the CD45RA+ subpopulation. CD8+ T cells from HLA-A*0201+ BKV
LTag seropositive donors were separated into CD45RA+ and CD45RA- fractions prior to stimulation with HLA-A*0201
restricted melanoma associated antigen MelanA/Mart-126–35 or BKV LTag 579 peptide. After 3-weekly restimulations in the
presence of peptide-loaded autologous mature DCs, cytotoxic activity was tested by 51Cr release assays, using as targets T2
cells following pre-incubation in the presence of specific or control peptides. The phenotypes of CD8+ cells stained by MelanA/
Mart-126–35 or BKV LTag 579 specific HLA-A*0201 multimers were also evaluated (panel A). Peptide specific IFN-γ production
elicited by CD45RA+ and CD45RA- CD8+ T cell subpopulations is reported on panel B.

can only be generated from CD45RA+ cells. Importantly,
even after these culture times, LTag 579 specific CD8+ T
cells retain a CD45RA+/CCR7- phenotype, a relatively
infrequent event for CTL recognizing BKV unrelated peptides.
Our study demonstrates for the first time that virtually all
HLA-A*0201+ BKV seropositive donors mount a powerful CTL response towards epitopes encompassed by a
highly phylogenetically conserved region of the LTag
implicated in the viral replicative activity and in the p53
mediated control of the cell cycle of host cells.
These results set the stage for further research aiming at
identifying appropriate formulations of LTag immunogenic peptides that might be used to stimulate BKV specific CTL responses in patients at risk of infection
reactivation and at clarifying whether this specific immunosurveillance fails in patients bearing tumors potentially
associated to BKV mediated oncogenic transformation.

Interestingly, these results may possibly also be extended
to JCV-seropositive individuals, as already seen for
VP1[48], due to the high homology that the two LTag-p53
binding domains share among the human polyomavirus
BK and JC strains. Clearly, in this context, our data may
suggest combined use of epitopes from capsid proteins
and LTag leading to innovative approaches in the treatment and prevention of human polyomavirus related diseases.
