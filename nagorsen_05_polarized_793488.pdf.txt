Conclusions: This analysis is directly informative of the primary effect of individual cytokines on
the early stages of LPS stimulation and, therefore, may be most informative of the way MP
maturation may be polarized at the early stages of the immune response.

Resident and recruited mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) display a versatile phenotype that reflects the plasticity of these
cells in response to microenvironmental signals. This heterogeneity spans a continuous spectrum that can be polarized
into two extremes recently described by Mantovani et al. [1].

Pathogen stimulation exemplified, for instance, by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in the presence of interferon
(IFN)-γ induces M1 MPs through engagement of Toll-like
receptors (TLRs). M1 MPs are true antigen-presenting cells
capable not only of killing invading organisms but of concomitantly recruiting and activating immune effector cells [2,3].

Background

Results: Circulating CD14+ MPs were exposed to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) followed by
exposure to an array of cytokines, chemokines and soluble factors involved in the immune
response. Gene expression was studied by global transcript analysis. Two main classes of cytokines
were identified that induced a classical or an alternative pathway of MP activation. Expression of
genes affected by NFκB activation was most predictive of the two main classes, suggesting that this
pathway is a fundamental target of cytokine regulation. As LPS itself induces a classical type of
activation, the most dramatic modulation was observed toward the alternative pathway, suggesting
that a broad array of cytokines may counteract the pro-inflammatory effects of bacterial
components.

refereed research

Background: Mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) stand at the crossroads between the induction of
acute inflammation to recruit and activate immune effector cells and the downmodulation of the
inflammatory process to contain collateral damage. This decision is extensively modulated by the
cytokine microenvironment, which includes a broad array of cytokines whose direct effect on MPs
remains largely unexplored. Therefore, we tested whether polarized responses of MPs to
pathogens are related to the influence of selected cytokines or represent a mandatory molecular
switch through which most cytokines operate.

Nagorsen et al.

Treatment of MPs with type II cytokines such as interleukin
(IL)-4, IL-13 and, partly, IL-10 [4], polarizes their function
towards tissue repair, angiogenesis and containment of collateral damage through reduction of inflammation (the M2
macrophage phenotype). This alternative mode of macrophage activation accounts for a distinct phenotype with a key
role in humoral immunity and tissue repair [5].
It has been suggested that the extreme dichotomy between a
classical M1 and an alternative M2 polarization of macrophage function may not take into account intermediate regulation by cytokines such as IL-10, transforming growth
factors (TGF-α and TGF-β), macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (M-CSF), IFN-α and IFN-β and tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) [5]. Most important, a rigid dichotomy in MP function
may not directly apply to physiological and/or pathological
conditions in which these cells are exposed to an array of
cytokines produced by innate or adaptive immune mechanisms during infection, tissue damage or in other conditions.
Indeed, a comprehensive overview of the modulatory properties of cytokines on the MP reaction to a pathogen is missing.
In addition, little is known about the transcriptional changes
occurring in MPs on exposure to pathogen components such
as LPS.
A recent study analyzed the transcriptional profile induced by
the exposure of circulating MP conditioned in vitro for 7 days
with IL-4 and GM-CSF (immature dendritic cell, (DC)) to
pathogen components [6]. Bacterial, viral and fungal components elicited distinctive pathways that were, however,
largely overlapping. The predominant response of these DCs
to most pathogen components encompassed a rapid upregulation of genes associated with the innate arm of the immune
response followed by induction of adaptive immune response
genes.
The response of circulating MP-derived DCs is short-lived as
these cells can exhaust their production of effector molecules
(cytokines and chemokines) within a few hours of LPS stimulation [7]. The transience of mRNA and protein expression
can cause DCs to redirect the immune response in different
ways at different time points. For instance, soon after stimulation, DCs elicit T-cell responses of the Th-1 type, whereas at
later stage of activation they prime T-cell responses of the Th2 type, suggesting that their function is strongly dependent on
the timing and duration of exposure to individual and/or
combined stimulatory conditions in the surrounding microenvironment. At the transcriptional level, the dual function of
DCs shifted from an early pre-inflammatory phase occurring
within 3 hours to a later regulatory phase occurring approximately 8 hours following LPS exposure. During these evolving stages of DC activation, cytokines play a dominant role in
shaping the function of DCs and other immune cells, providing a malleable link between the innate and adaptive immune
responses [8]. In natural conditions, circulating or resident
MPs may encounter a pathogen before the surrounding

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/2/R15

microenvironment has a chance to influence their maturation. Therefore, it is unknown whether non-conditioned circulating CD14+ MPs would react similarly to DCs on
engagement with infectious agents. Thus, a preliminary aim
of this study was to evaluate the kinetics of the response of
non-conditioned circulating CD14+ MP to LPS. The results
suggested that these cells respond to LPS similarly to immature CD14- DCs, with a surge in transcriptional activity that
peaks around 3 hours after stimulation and in which the activation of genes associated with a classical activation of innate
immune mechanisms predominates [6].
The stringent dichotomy describing a classical activation of
MPs into mature antigen-presenting cells caused by IFN-γ
and an alternative induction into macrophages induced by IL4 and IL-13 may not apply to physiological conditions in
which the microenvironment responds to pathogen exposure
with a broad array of cytokine secretion. We therefore investigated whether polarized responses of MPs to pathogens are
extreme behaviors that can be observed in vitro by studying a
few illustrative cytokines or whether they represent a mandatory molecular switch through which most cytokines operate.
Thus, we stimulated non-conditioned CD14+ MPs with LPS
for 1 hour. The MPs were then exposed to an array of different
cytokines that may be expressed in distinct pathologic conditions by different immune-cell subsets. The 1-hour interval
was empirically selected to induce a biphasic model in which
the presumed modulation by cytokines occurred during an
ongoing reaction to LPS. This allowed mapping of cytokines
into conditional subclasses based on their effects on the global transcriptional changes responsible for MP activation and
differentiation.
Two main classes of cytokines were identified that induced a
classical or alternative pathway of MP activation, respectively. An intermediate class (including IL-10) was also identified, while TNF-α, TNF-β and GM-CSF displayed a quite
distinct behavior from the other cytokines. Expression of
genes affected by NFκB activation was most predictive of the
two main classes, suggesting that in most cases the NFκB
pathway is a central target of cytokine regulation that modulates the cascade of events following LPS stimulation. Overall,
it seems that MP maturation/differentiation goes through a
molecular switch that is partly independent of the fine differences in the stimulatory properties of the various cytokines
and, with few exceptions, is pre-programmed towards a classical or an alternative route. As LPS itself induces a classical
type of activation, the most dramatic modulation in this
model was observed toward the alternative pathway, suggesting that a broad array of cytokines may counteract the proinflammatory effects of bacterial components.

Aliquots of CD14+ MPs were stimulated in parallel with LPS

Although LPS alone strongly affected the transcriptional program of MPs, it was possible to discern the contribution of
individual cytokines. This analysis was limited to samples
treated for 4 hours, when the most dramatic effects on gene
modulation were noted. Genes differentially expressed in
samples treated with cytokines compared to those treated
with LPS alone were identified. Stringent criteria were
applied to select genes expressed in at least 80% of samples
with a threefold or greater increase or reduction in expression
over LPS in at least one of the cytokine-treated samples. This
gave 2,057 genes that were deemed most relevant to the analysis. Using these genes, all cytokine-treated samples were
subjected to unsupervised clustering to evaluate their relatedness (Figure 2a).

Kinetics of the response of CD14+ MPs to LPS and its
modulation by cytokines

Transcriptional modulation by cytokines 4 hours after
LPS stimulation of CD14+ MPs

refereed research

Enriched MP preparations (about 90% CD14+) were exposed
to LPS. Total RNA extracts were obtained 4 and 9 hours after.
These time points were selected to catch salient stages of the
biphasic response of MP to LPS described by others [6,7].
Amplified antisense RNA (aRNA) [9] was hybridized to a custom-made 17,000 (17K)-clone cDNA microarray chip
enriched with genes relevant to immune function. The transcriptional profile of LPS-induced MPs was similar to that
described by others in DCs [6]. In particular, genes associated
with the innate response of CD14-, immature DCs to pathogen
components [6,10] were similarly upregulated in CD14+ MPs
(data not shown). This finding suggests that the differential
expression of the LPS co-receptor CD14 between the two cell
populations has a relatively minor impact on the transcriptional regulation of the innate immune response [11].

The average number of genes whose expression was increased
compared to unstimulated MPs was higher (420 genes) after
4 hours than after 9 hours (265 genes). About half of the genes
upregulated after 4 hours remained upregulated at 9 hours
(223 genes). This is in accordance with Huang's observation
[6] that transcriptional changes in DCs occur predominantly
in the early phase of the response to pathogen components,
with about half the genes displaying transitory expression
and the other half sustained expression. For this reason, subsequent analyses were limited to the 4-hour time point.

Effect of LPS stimulation on circulating CD14+ MPs

greatest influence on the global transcriptional profile of MP
induction; samples preferentially clustered according to time
of stimulation rather than type of treatment. This was underlined by the observation that MPs stimulated with LPS alone
clustered with the cytokine-stimulated MPs according to the
time elapsed after stimulation. In addition, a cluster containing most of the samples obtained 9 hours after stimulation
(9') included three control samples consisting of CD14+ MPs
not exposed to LPS or cytokines (no stimulation). These three
samples were prepared at times 0, 4 and 9 hours to parallel
the culture conditions used for stimulation. This finding suggested that the transcriptional profile of CD14+ MPs 9 hours
after LPS stimulation and 8 hours after treatment with most
cytokines converges toward a less reactive metabolic state
closer to that of unstimulated MPs. Several cytokines, however, maintained a more active metabolic profile and after 9
hours retained a transcriptional footprint relatively close to
that of samples treated for 4 hours (9"). This group included
the genes for most IFN-α isoforms, IFN-β, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), FLT-3 ligand, TGF-α, the chemokine RANTES (CCL5), IL-2, IL-4, IL-15 and the chemokines
MIP1α (CCL3) and MIP1β (CCL4), suggesting that these
cytokines may have relatively prolonged kinetics of MP
activation.

hybridized to custom-made 17K cDNA arrays. Unsupervised Eisen

any stimulation and were obtained at different time points to parallel
culture conditions during stimulation (0, 4 and 9 h). Light blue and gold

black represents no stimulation. A375 is a melanoma cell line that was
used for quality control alternating conventional (Cy5, red) or reciprocal

Experiments cluster closer together according to time rather than type of

the exception of few cytokines (4"). With few exceptions (9"), cytokine
treatments at 9 h clustered together with non-stimulated MPs (9').

This independent analysis segregated cytokines into two

refereed research

Signatures associated with several pathways of immune-cell
activation were constructed by selecting genes from the global
pool of 17K clones according to literature information without
pre-existing information about the association of their
expression to either class of cytokines. Signature genes were
then subjected to supervised clustering according to the
cytokine classification shown in Figure 2a. This independent
process identified virtual signatures, in some cases portraying
opposite transcriptional regulation by the two classes. The
signature that most strongly discriminated the two classes
comprised 121 genes whose expression is closely dependent
on NFκB modulation [11] (Figure 3a). This is not surprising as
LPS acts through engagement of Toll receptor 4 (TLR4) and
CD14, with resulting activation of NFκB [3]. It would, therefore, seem intuitive that the strongest modulation in the
present experimental conditions would target this pathway.
In particular, several TNF- and IL-1-related genes classically
modulated by NFκB during the acute phases of the innate
immune response [11] were strongly and inversely modulated
by the two cytokine classes.

class (Figure 2a, red line) included IFN-α2, IFN-β, IFN-γ,
CD40 ligand (CD40L), and FLT-3 ligand, which are generally
associated with the classical pathway of MP activation [2,3].
Therefore, we considered the first cluster representative of
the alternative and the second of the classical pathway of MP
activation in response to LPS. As predicted by Gordon [5], few
cytokines (Figure 2a, green line) did not properly belong to
either class. These included IL-10, IL-1β, IL-15 and two IFNα isoforms. Because several of these cytokines have previously been associated with the alternative pathway, we
referred to this class as alternative II. Not surprisingly [5],
MPs stimulated with TNF-α (Figure 2a, purple line) and,
most dramatically, TNF-β and GM-CSF (Figure 2a, black line)
had a totally independent effect on the transcriptional regulation of LPS-induced CD14+ MPs [5].

Alternative cytokines induced the expression of several
cytokines and their respective receptors involved in the chemotaxis and activation of neutrophils, MPs, natural killer (NK)
cells, DCs, helper T lymphocytes (Th2) and B lymphocytes.
Several genes known to be associated with alternative MP
activation [5,23] were consistently upregulated. These
included the mannose receptor, the inhibitory Fc-IIb receptor
CD32, and the cell-surface molecule CD44 [24], which is
associated with the disposal of inflammatory cell corpses
without expansion of the inflammatory process. Several
inducible chemokines were expressed in response to alternative stimulation such as CCL22/MDC, supporting the emerging role of this cytokine as an enhancer of polarized Th2
responses [25]. Other chemokines known to be induced by
master type II cytokines and associated with the induction of
Th2 responses were also induced by alternative activation;
these included CCL11 (eotaxin), CCL1 (I-309), CCL2 (MCP-1)
and CCL7 (MCP-3) [23]. Of interest was the relatively higher
expression of IL-24, a cytokine belonging to the IL-10 family
constitutively expressed by MPs [26]. Although the true role
of this cytokine in inflammatory processes is not known, it is
likely that its pro-apoptotic and angioregulatory properties
have important roles in tissue repair and remodeling during

refereed research

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are tightly connected to
MP activation. MMP released by MPs contribute to normal
and pathological tissue remodeling and MP migration. In
addition MMP function as regulatory proteins by promoting
the activation or degradation of cytokines. Finally, MMP are
susceptible to cytokine stimulation. Thirty-six MMP and
MMP-related genes (filtered from a larger group of 184
MMPs, disintegrins, α-defensins, TGF-β, TNF-α, insulin-like
growth factor 1 (IGF-1), epidermal growth factor (EGF),
fibroblast growth factor (FGF), IL-1 and monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (CCL7/MCP-3) genes) [16,17] were clustered
according to the alternative and classical group denomination
and the 11 most representative are shown in Figure 4. The
alternative group of cytokines induced the transcription of
MMPs (MMP 7, 9, 10, 19), enzymes related to MMP function
(disintegrin ADAM 9, pro-collagen proline dioxygenase,
MEK1 kinase, serine protease inhibitor, cathepsin L) and
structural proteins (gap junction connexin 26, laminin A/C).
This confirms the role of alternative MP activation in promoting tissue remodeling, cell-cell interactions and local control
of the inflammatory process through activation (via MMP-7,
9) [18-21] or degradation (via MMP-19) of cytokine activity
[17,22]. In addition, these observations suggest a role for the

selection of genes relevant to MP function is shown in Figure
5. In most cases, the pattern of expression echoed the class
allocation suggested by the literature [23]. Classical cytokines
induced genes responsible for the cytotoxic and migratory
properties of MPs such as those for CD95, TRAIL, granzymes,
perforin, CD16 (stimulatory Fcγ receptor) and CD62L. In
addition, antigen presentation was enhanced as suggested by
the coordinate expression of several HLA class II genes. IFNγ and the other classical cytokines inhibited the expression of
the macrophage-derived chemokine CCL22/MDC, while
upregulating the expression of CXCR3, as previously reported
[23].

were caused by classical cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-3).
Extracts from MPs stimulated only with LPS also failed to
demonstrate changes in NFκB subunit release; this is probably related to the 90-minute period from stimulation that
allowed a return of signaling molecules to baseline conditions
(Figure 3c). The similarity of the IL-1α and TNF-α effects on
p50 to those of alternative cytokines contrasts with the dramatic differences observed on the respective transcriptional
profiles, suggesting that other pathways induced by these
cytokines may prevail in the conditions tested here.

Effect of cytokines on the expression of genes for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and MMP-related genes. MMP genes and MMP-related genes (such as
disintegrins, IFN-γ and related genes, IFN-α, α-defensins, TGF-β, TNF-α, IGF-1, EGF, FGF, IL-1, MCP-3 - complete list available from the authors on

inflammation. Finally, various chemokine receptors responsible for MP trafficking and localization were differentially
regulated by the two cytokine groups, including in particular
CCR1 and CCR5, which were induced by alternative stimulation, and CCR2, induced by classical stimulation.
This early transcriptional profile underlines the primary role
of MPs during the acute phases of the response to pathogen as
effector cells that can kill pathogens, take up antigen and
migrate to local regional lymph nodes to recruit adaptive
immune responses (classical activation). In contrast, alternative cytokines may be produced in the microenvironment to
maintain a resident MP phenotype rich in chemokine production, which can attract Th2-type immune responses while
continuing pathogen clearance through retention of phagocyte properties and promoting tissue remodeling.
Surprisingly, genes of the IL-1 family and its receptors, TNF
and IL-6 were consistently upregulated by the alternative

class of cytokines, suggesting that LPS alters MP polarization
with regard to these cytokines [5,10]. Particularly interesting
is the alternative induction of IL-6 and its receptor, which
may play a central role in mediating the transition from neutrophils to MP recruitment during progression from acute to
chronic inflammation [27].

Validation of microarray analysis by TaqMan real-time
PCR
To define the validity and accuracy of our global microarray
analysis, quantitative TaqMan real-time PCR was performed
on amplified RNA material isolated after stimulation of
monocytes obtained from five additional normal donors with
representative cytokines/soluble factors selected from the
alternative and from the classical groups. Comparison of
monocyte stimulation with a candidate cytokine from the
alternative/M2 (IL-4) and the classical/M1 (IFN-γ) group,
respectively, is shown in Figure 6. Ten genes whose expression

was upregulated by alternative cytokines were tested, as
the thrust of the analysis was the evaluation of the effect of
alternative cytokines on LPS-stimulated MPs. The relative
expression of five genes out of 10 (IL-1α, IL-1 receptor, mannose receptor, NFKb-p105/50 and TRAF) was significantly
higher after treatment with IL-4, as suggested by the array
data. Also, the expression profiles of the other genes tested
reproduced the pattern observed in the array experiments
even if they did not reach statistical significance for each individual gene. This is not surprising because array experiments
summarize in signature fine differences in gene expression,
that often describe patterns rather than absolute significance
for individual genes.
Reproducibility of the estimates of mannose receptor, NFKbp105/50 and TRAF gene expression in MPs obtained from the
same five donors was evaluated after stimulation with four
cytokines/soluble factors selected from the alternative (IL-13,
IL-1α, IL-4, TGF-β) and four from the classical groups (FLT3 ligand, IFN-γ, IL-3, CD40L) (Figure 7). In all cases gene
expression significantly reflected the pattern of gene expression detected by microarray analysis (Figures 3, 5).

Discussion

It has been suggested that MP activation and maturation
progresses through a polarized mechanism whereby two
extreme products result that promote inflammation on one
side and tissue repair on the other [1,5]. The first mechanism
has been called the classical pathway of MP activation. It
induces M1 monocytes specialized for pathogen killing and
activation of innate and adaptive immune effector cells. A second, alternative, pathway induces M2-type monocytes committed to clearing pathogen through internal metabolism
while reducing inflammation. This process limits the collateral damage induced by an excessive immune response, and,
upon cessation of the pathogenic stimulus, promotes tissue
repair. This dichotomy is based on the study of a few
cytokines deemed representative of the classical mode (LPS,
IFN-γ) or the alternative mode (IL-4, IL-13) of MP activation.
Other cytokines such as IL-10, TGF, M-CSF, IFN-α/β and
TNF, although partially overlapping both pathways, display
functional effects that diverge significantly enough that they
would be inaccurately grouped in either class [5].
In this study we evaluated whether MP commitment is
dependent on an early bipolar switch through which most
cytokines operate. This was done by testing in parallel a
library of 42 stimulatory molecules possibly present in the tissue microenvironment following a pathogenic insult. This
modulation was tested on MPs triggered by a pathogenic
stimulus, exemplified in this case by LPS. This was done on
the assumption that in most circumstances resident or migratory MPs reaching an infected area are exposed concomitantly to a pathogen and to the cytokine milieu resulting from
the infection. The transcriptional profile identified by this
study cannot distinguish between the direct effect of each soluble factor analyzed and the downstream activation of transcriptional pathways by secondary paracrine or autocrine
secretion of biological modifiers by MPs. However, the main
goal of this study was to identify the overall effect on MPs of
the exposure to individual cytokines. Future analyses,
focused on specific cytokine patterns described here, should
possibly include the addition of blocking antibodies to segregate secondary from primary MP responses.
The results suggest that MP activation is in most cases a bipolar process regulated by an internal switch through which
cytokines modulate the yin and yang of the MP transcriptional program. In fact, most cytokines preferentially induced
one or other pattern of transcriptional activation. We, therefore, mapped most of the cytokines within a classical or an
alternative classification according to their effects on CD14+,
LPS-induced MPs. In particular, it appeared that transcriptional programs down-stream of NFκB activation [11] were
mostly associated with either class, suggesting that the NFκB
system is at the center of the switch regulating MP activation/
differentiation in the conditions tested in the present study.
This is not surprising as LPS signaling is mediated through
the TLR-4 and CD14, which in turn directly regulate the IκB

This information cannot of course be generalized to other
conditions as the model tested is strongly biased by NFκB
induction by LPS. This is underlined by the unexpected alternative upregulation of genes associated with IL-1, TNF and
IL-6 [11]. This observation suggests that in different conditions, cytokines may differently modulate MP activation, possibly through various modulatory feedback mechanisms [5].

cytokine regulation modulates the release of the p50 subunit
of NFκB, whch is in turn responsible for the downstream
effects on the transcriptional program. Interestingly, reclustering of cytokines based on NFκB-dependent genes consolidated the two classes of cytokines adding TNF-α and TNF-β,
IFN-α2b and GM-CSF to the classical group and the alternative type II cytokines with the alternative group, suggesting
that NFκB may be central to MP polarization.

tion and are indirectly associated with NFκB function were, at
least in part, differentially regulated by the two classes of
cytokines [30-32]. It has been suggested that inducible nitric
oxide is produced rapidly after LPS stimulation of MPs and
inhibits NFκB through the stabilization of IκB [16]. It is possible that cytokines may counteract this effect through modulation of this metabolic junction.
Cytokine and chemokine effects on MP function are tightly
intertwined with the enzymatic activities of MMP. Membrane-bound cytokine receptors and adhesion molecules can
be released from the cell surface by MMPs acting as 'sheddases' or 'convertases'. This, in turn, can downregulate cellsurface signaling by removal of receptors, or induce paracrine
activity by release of soluble proteins. Not surprisingly, IL-13
overexpression results in production of several MMPs [33].
For instance, MMP-9 activates latent TNF-α on the surface of
MPs or soluble VEGF [19,34]. Furthermore, Yu and Stamenkovic [21] observed that gelatinase B/MMP9 bound to CD44
activates latent TGF-β stored in the pericellular matrix.
MMP-7 can enhance tissue repair by facilitating migration of
epithelial cells [16]. In agreement with these reports we
observed that the transcription of MMP-7, MMP-9 and CD44
are coordinately induced (Figures 4, 6) by the alternative activation of MPs. Conversely, the downregulation of MMP-7 and
MMP-9 by the classical cytokines confirms their inhibitory
effects on MMP expression. Inhibition of MMP-9 production
by IFN-β and IFN-γ has been recently reported by Sanceau et
al. [35], who noted that interferons regulate MMP expression
through IRF/NFκB interaction. Binding of NFκB p50/p65 to
the MMP-9 promoter is competitively inhibited by IFN-β and
IFN-γ-induced IRF-1. Possibly, NFκB regulation of MMP promoters through release of p50 (Figure 3) was responsible for
the transcriptional activation of MMP expression by alternative cytokines observed in this study (Figure 4). These observations confirm the tight specificity of the relationship
between cytokine and MMP regulation, which is finely toned
at several check points and strongly polarized, in these experimental conditions, toward an M2 phenotype.
Enhanced transcription of gap junction/connexin 26 by the
alternative cytokines is also of particular interest in view of
the hypothesized junctional communications among MPs or
between MPs and endothelial cells [36,37]. The finding that
MPs activated by alternative cytokines induce the transcription of genes for gap junction components is of physiological
importance and may be the missing link in the identification
of factors that regulate the expression of gap junction connexins in MPs. In addition, it opens up the possibility that in a
milieu dominated by alternative cytokines, where the ultimate goal is to return to homeostasis, the induction of gap
junctions increases the ability to transmit or receive regulatory signals [38] that could facilitate the return to normal
housekeeping functions.

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/2/R15

Conclusions

The early-phase transcriptional profile presented in this
study may not comprehensively parallel the plethora of biological effects that a given cytokine can induce under in vitro
or, most importantly, in vivo conditions. Secondary, autocrine and paracrine modulation through the cytokine
network following a primary stimulation may introduce novel
on and off switches that could override the original signal.
Nevertheless, this analysis is directly informative on the primary effect of individual cytokines on the early stages of LPS
stimulation and, therefore, may be most informative on the
way MP maturation may be polarized at the early stages of the
immune response. The clustering of most cytokines into two
main groups suggests that their control of central switches
(NFκB), or regulatory molecules (cytokines, MMPs, gap junctions, cytotoxic molecules, migratory markers) is essentially
bimodal. This polarization program turns MPs to a 'cytotoxic'
or a 'symbiotic' phenotype [18]. In physiologic conditions,
this dualism is probably modulated by a multiplicity of factors: the extent and duration of the environmental insult and
the conditions of the resulting microenvironment. Possibly,
predominant and persistent stimulation by pathogen components (such as LPS) may polarize MP towards the cytotoxic
phenotype. A predominantly regulatory response is then
mounted by the host, mediated by alternative cytokines that
would take over at a later stage to induce a symbiotic
phenotype aimed at resuming homeostasis upon pathogen
clearance.

Materials and methods
MP separation and FACS staining
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from an HLAA*0201-positive healthy caucasian male donor age 35 were
collected at the Department of Transfusion Medicine, NIH.
PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll gradient separation and frozen
until analysis. After thawing, PBMCs were kept overnight in
175-cm2 tissue-culture flasks (Costar) in complete medium
(CM) consisting of Iscove's medium (Biofluids) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated human AB-serum (Gemini
Bioproducts), 10 mM HEPES buffer (Cellgro; Mediatech),
0.03% l-glutamine (Biofluids), 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Biofluids), 10 µg/ml ciprofloxacin (Bayer), and 0.5
mg/ml amphotericin B (Biofluids). Adherent and non-adherent cells were gently removed from the flask and centrifugated. MPs were separated by negative selection using the MP
isolation kit and an autoMACS system (Miltenyi). Before and
after separation cells were stained with anti-CD14-FITC
(Becton Dickinson), and analyzed using a FACScalibur flow
cytometer and CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson).

Stimulation of MPs and RNA isolation
Negatively selected CD14+ cells were washed twice with
serum-free OPTI-MEM (OM) medium (Gibco-BRL) prepared
similarly to CM. CD14+ cells were then seeded at a concentration of 1 × 106/ml in 10 ml OM in 25 cm2 flasks (Falcon) and

stimulated with 5 µg/ml LPS (Sigma) for 1 h. LPS was used at
5 µg/ml to simulate maximal pathogen exposure as in [6]. No
LPS was added to the non-stimulation control flask. After 1 h,
42 cytokines, chemokines and soluble factors were added
individually to the MP suspensions (Table 1). Then, 4 and 9 h
after LPS stimulation, MPs were harvested, washed twice in
PBS and lysed for RNA isolation using 700 µl RNeasy lysis
buffer (Qiagen) per 25 cm2 flask, according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Probe preparation, amplification and hybridization to
microarrays
Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy minikits (Qiagen).
Amplified antisense RNA (aRNA) was prepared from total
RNA (0.5-3 µg) according the protocol previously described
by us [9,39]. Test samples were labeled with Cy5-dUTP
(Amersham) while the reference sample (pooled normal
donor PBMCs) was labeled with Cy3-dUTP. Test-reference
sample pairs were mixed and co-hybridized to 17K cDNA
microarrays.

from the classical groups (FLT-3L, IFN-γ, IL-3, CD40L). TaqMan real-time PCR was performed on amplified RNA material isolated after stimulation for 4 h in conditions identical to
those applied for the cDNA array study to validate the expression of the following 10 genes: TRAF binding protein, NFκBp105/50, MMP9, MMP19, MCP-1, mannose receptor, IL-24,
IL-1R, IL-1A and FADD-MORT. An ABI Prism 7900 HT
sequence detection system with 384-well capability (Applied
Biosystems) was used for detection. Primers and TaqMan
probes (Biosource) were designed to span exon-intron junctions and to generate amplicons of less than 150 bp. TaqMan
probes were labeled at the 5' end with the reporter dye molecule FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein; emission λmax = 518 nm)
and at the 3' end with the quencher dye molecule TAMRA (6carboxytetramethylrhodamine; emission λmax = 582 nm). The
following are the sequences for forward (f) and reverse (r)
primer and probe (p) pairs:

Microarrays and statistical analyses
Hybridized arrays were scanned at 10-µm resolution on a
GenePix 4000 scanner (Axon Instruments) at variable PMT
voltage to obtain maximal signal intensities with less than 1%
probe saturation. Resulting jpeg and data files were analyzed
via mAdb Gateway Analysis tool [40]. Data were further analyzed using Cluster and TreeView software [12] and Partek
Pro software (Partek). The global gene-expression profiling of
4- and 9-h treated and untreated MP consisted of 98 experimental samples. Subsequent low-stringency filtering (80%
gene presence across all experiments and removal of genes
that did not have a log2 ≥ 1.2: 2.3 ratio in at least one of the

[12] was based on these genes. Gene ratios were average corrected across experimental samples and displayed according
to the central method for display using a normalization factor
as recommended by Ross [41].

NFκB protein activation analysis
MPs separated from peripheral blood by adherence were
stimulated for 1 h with LPS and for an additional 30 min with
cytokines selected from the alternative group (IL-4, IL-13, IL1α) or the classical group (IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-3). In addition,
TNF-α was tested. After 90 min stimulation, cytoplasmic cell
extracts were isolated using a cytoplasmic and nuclear extract
kit (Active Motif), and the TransAM NFκB transcription factor kit (Active Motif) was used to detect activation of NFκB
subunits p50, p52, p65, c-Rel and RelB, according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Linear regression analyses of all standard curves were 0.98 or
greater. Standard curve extrapolation of copy number and
quantity means were performed using the ABI Prism SDS 2.1
software (Applied Biosystems). Normalization of samples
was performed by dividing the quantity mean of the gene of
interest run in duplicate by the quantity mean of reference
actin filament associated protein (AFAP) gene × 105 [43].

Standards for the selected genes were amplified by reverse
transcriptase primer-specific amplification of 6 µg antisense
RNA obtained from PBMCs stimulated in vitro with IL-2
(300 IU/ml and Flu M1 peptide) and reverse transcribed
using random dN6 primers (Boehringer Mannheim). Amplified cDNA standards were quantified by spectrometry and the
number of copies was calculated using the Oligo Calculator
software [42]. Six micrograms of test antisense RNA samples
were converted to cDNA using random primers and were
immediately used for quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR).
RT-PCR reactions of cDNA samples were conducted in a total
volume of 20 µl, including 1 µl cDNA, 1x TaqMan Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems), 2 µl of 20 µM primers and 1 µl of 12.5
µM probe. Thermal cycler parameters included 2 min at 50°C,
10 min 95°C and 40 cycles involving denaturation at 95°C for
15 sec, annealing-extension at 60°C for 1 min.
