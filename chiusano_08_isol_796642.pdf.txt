Abstract
Background: Present-day ‘-omics’ technologies produce overwhelming amounts of data which include genome
sequences, information on gene expression (transcripts and proteins) and on cell metabolic status. These data represent
multiple aspects of a biological system and need to be investigated as a whole to shed light on the mechanisms which
underpin the system functionality.
The gathering and convergence of data generated by high-throughput technologies, the effective integration of different
data-sources and the analysis of the information content based on comparative approaches are key methods for
meaningful biological interpretations.
In the frame of the International Solanaceae Genome Project, we propose here ISOLA, an Italian SOLAnaceae genomics
resource.
Results: ISOLA (available at http://biosrv.cab.unina.it/isola) represents a trial platform and it is conceived as a multi-level
computational environment.
ISOLA currently consists of two main levels: the genome and the expression level. The cornerstone of the genome level
is represented by the Solanum lycopersicum genome draft sequences generated by the International Tomato Genome
Sequencing Consortium. Instead, the basic element of the expression level is the transcriptome information from
different Solanaceae species, mainly in the form of species-specific comprehensive collections of Expressed Sequence
Tags (ESTs).
The cross-talk between the genome and the expression levels is based on data source sharing and on tools that enhance
data quality, that extract information content from the levels' under parts and produce value-added biological knowledge.
Conclusions: ISOLA is the result of a bioinformatics effort that addresses the challenges of the post-genomics era. It is
designed to exploit ‘-omics’ data based on effective integration to acquire biological knowledge and to approach a systems

biology view. Beyond providing experimental biologists with a preliminary annotation of the tomato genome, this effort
aims to produce a trial computational environment where different aspects and details are maintained as they are relevant
for the analysis of the organization, the functionality and the evolution of the Solanaceae family.

Background
The Solanaceae family comprises about 95 genera and at
least 2,400 species. Many of these species have considerable economic importance as food (tomato, potato, eggplant, garden pepper), drug (tobacco) and ornamental
plants (petunia). The Solanaceae species show a wide
morphological variability and occupy various ecological
niches though they share high genome conservation. The
need of increasing the knowledge on the genetic mechanisms which determine Solanaceae diversification and
adaptation has brought the scientific efforts to be gathered
into the International Solanaceae (SOL) Genome Project
[1].
The cultivated tomato, Solanum lycopersicum, is the plant
chosen by the SOL initiative for a BAC-by-BAC sequencing of the genome euchromatin portion, which is considered the gene rich region and represents the 25% of the
entire genome [2].
The long term goal is to exploit the information generated
by the Tomato Genome Sequencing Consortium [3] for
the analysis of the genome organization, the functionality
and the evolution of the entire Solanaceae family.
The major bioinformatics effort within the international
project currently aims to provide a high quality and
homogeneous annotation of the tomato genome. To this
end, the international Tomato Annotation Group (iTAG)
organized an annotation pipeline which is parcelled out
among different members of the consortium and which
will result in the release of the annotated tomato genome.
As members of the iTAG, we are committed to collect and
manage Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) data from different
Solanaceae species and to generate alignments of native
and non-native ESTs to the tomato genome.
Furthermore, large amounts of data from different ‘-omics’
approaches are being generated to address key questions
risen by the SOL vision. Raw data are hardly useful as they
stand and need to be converted into biologically meaningful information. Therefore, bioinformatics approaches
become pre-eminent, though their results may be far from
being exhaustive and complete. The success of bioinformatics is directly dependent on the efficiency of integration, which in turn is determined by the diversity of data
sources, the quality of their annotation and the level of
details of the information produced. This remarks the

need of designing computational platforms to support
research in the post-genome era. The Solanaceae family
represents a suitable context to face these challenges and
to optimize and tune up the existing bioinformatics methods. To this end, we designed a trial platform, ISOLA (Italian SOLAnaceae genomics resource), for exploiting
Solanaceae ‘-omics’ data to address different and complex
biological questions crossing the ‘-omics’ barrier for
exploring the data as a whole.
In addition, such an effort is going with the iTAG tomato
genome annotation, and will maintain details and features that will be reconciled into, or will be discarded by,
the official annotation, but that may still highlight useful
information. Meanwhile the tomato genome initiative is
under way, this platform provides a preliminary annotation of the tomato genome and makes available to the
plant community tools for its structural, functional and
comparative analyses.

Results
Here we present ISOLA, an Italian SOLAnaceae genomics
resource available at [4]. ISOLA is designed as a multilevel computational environment and meets the need to
collect, integrate and explore high-throughput and heterogeneous biological data with the intent that the quality
of the data gathered could be enhanced.
ISOLA is currently organized into two main levels: the
genome and expression levels (Figure 1). The cornerstone
of the genome level is represented by the tomato genome
draft sequences. The basic elements of the expression level
are the Solanaceae EST collections and the oligonucleotide probe-sets of the tomato expression micro-arrays
[5,6].
‘Basic’ tools are designed and included into the multi-level
environment for enhancing data quality and increasing
data information content. ‘Subsidiary’ tools lay over the
existing multi-level environment exploiting the synergy
between the levels.
Each level can be independently accessed through specific
Web applications which allow user-driven data investigation and permit overall as well as detailed views of specific
information (Figure 2). A non-stop cross-talk between the
genome and the expression levels is based on data source
sharing and on tools which accomplish data integration
and convergence.

Representation of the multilevel structure in ISOLA. Data sources, tools and methods of the platform are indicated.
The genome and the expression levels' under parts are included in the light and dark grey areas, respectively. Shared data are
located in the gridded area. Subsidiary tools lay on the interface of the two levels. Value-added data gathered from the platform
are listed and enclosed in the level to which they contribute more. Entry points for proteome and metabolome approaches are
indicated.

Herein, we describe the organization and the maintenance of the platform which has been designed in order
to be extended, through pre-defined entry points, to the
proteome and metabolome levels.

BAC annotation
The BAC annotation process aims to identify coding
regions and other genetic elements along the S. lycopersicum genome sequences.

Genome level
BAC sequences retrieval
An automated pipeline has been implemented in order to
ensure a daily retrieval of new S. lycopersicum BAC
sequences from the GenBank repository, which are used
to feed the genome annotation process. The current collection (May 2007) comprises 129 BAC sequences.

The protein coding ‘gene finding’ process is exclusively
based on the EST spliced-alignments to the genome
sequences. To accomplish this task, ESTs from different
plant sources (Solanaceae and Rubiaceae species), and the
corresponding tentative consensus sequences (TCs),
which have been generated by assembling ESTs in a cluster [7], are used. The available data are all described in
table 1 where the two rightmost columns (ESTs/TCs

Snapshot of the Web-based application for navigating ISOLA
Snapshot of the Web-based application for navigating ISOLA. ISOLA is accessible through two different gateways.
The Genome Browser gateway let the user explore the list of the tomato BAC sequences, grouped by chromosome number,
and visualize the tracks that are displayed along each BAC sequence. Each track is cross-linked to other local or external
resources. Cross-references to the tomato genome annotation pages at the SOL Genomics Network are part of the ‘genome
level’ too.
The Solanaceae EST database gateway let the user investigate Solanaceae transcriptomes as revealed by EST sampling. Each EST
database can be queried with keywords to identify functional annotations associated to a single EST or a TC. Cross-links to the
UniProt external resource are established. In case an expressed sequence affects an enzyme function, a cross-link to the corresponding KEGG metabolic pathway(s) is provided. These links permit data from proteomics and metabolomics approaches to
be integrated in the existing multi-level environment. In addition, the association of the tomato ESTs to the oligo-nucleotide
probes from the Affymetrix or from the TED database expands information concerning the ‘expression level’ and provides the
opportunity to integrate into the platform data from expression profiling arrays.

mapped) report the number of ESTs and TCs per species,
aligned to the 129 BAC sequences. ESTs of non-native origin (i.e. EST data compiled in the local PotatEST and
SOLEST databases) are included in the analysis so to
improve detection of coding regions which lack sourcenative EST evidence and support comparative approaches.

genomes [10], the transposable elements are ubiquitous
and heterogeneous also in tomato. The reason why no
other types of repeats have been aligned to the BACs is
that the tomato genome sequencing is preliminarily
focused on the euchromatic regions [3], which are considered gene richer.

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) from the Rfam collection [8]
are aligned to genome sequences too. We identified 105
RNA matches which correspond to 48 different gene loci.
They represent 10 distinct RNA types whose occurrence
and distribution are reported in table 2.

The tomato Genome Browser Database
The BAC sequences collected in ISOLA are annotated and
released to the scientific community through the Gbrowse
[11] Web application at [4]. Tracks showing annotations
and other features are displayed and cross-linked to other
local or external databases which can be explored through
Web interfaces (Figure 2).

The TIGR Solanaceae Repeats database [9] is the resource
selected for the identification of repetitive sequences in
the S. lycopersicum genome.
The repeats identified on the 129 BAC sequences are listed
in Additional file 1 according to the TIGR Plant Repeat
Database classification schema. We identified 264
matches corresponding to 71 different genome loci. All the
genomic regions identified, unless the one detected on the
BAC AC171733 (26388::27727) and labelled as unclassified, corresponds to the transposable element (TEs) superclass. Among these 66 are retrotransposons, while the
remaining 4 are members of the transposon class. Considering the retrotransposon class, 6 of them are unclassified,
20 are Ty1-copia and 40 are Ty3-gypsy. As usual in plants

Aligning Arabidopsis thaliana RNA sequences
The availability of the full genome sequence of Arabidopsis
thaliana is a cornerstone for plant biology [12,13]. We
aligned all the RNA sequences from the model plant Arabidopsis to the tomato genome in order to identify genes
that are conserved between the two species. However,
only 326 out of 31,249 RNA sequences were mapped onto
the S. lycopersicum BACs.

The majority of the RNA sequences (324) do not overlap
any genome region covered by Solanaceae ESTs. The RNA
sequences are annotated as tRNAs and locate 24 distinct
gene loci. The sole AT3G08520 sequence, annotated as “a

assigned to the chromosome 7. This indicates that, given
the large phylogenetic distance between tomato and Arabidopsis, mRNA sequences are hardly identified when the

RNA to genome alignments are filtered out with 90%
identity and 80% coverage (See Methods).

species [14]. The comprehensive array consists of over
10,000 probe sets to interrogate over 9,200 S. lycopersicum
transcripts [5].
To date, 4,445 out of 112,528 probes are mapped to the
tomato genome. Because some probes are aligned to BAC
sequences more than one time, the number of the
matches identified (5,827) is higher than the number of
the distinct probes aligned.
In particular, 680 oligonucleotide probes do not overlap
any S. lycopersicum EST. On the other hand 197 probes are
in genomic regions where non-native ESTs have been
aligned: S. tuberosum (164 probes), S. habrochaites (12
probes), S. chacoense (12 probes) and both S. habrochaites
and S. tuberosum (9 probes). 483 oligonucleotide probes
do not overlap any EST.
Expression level
EST data processing
We collected all the EST data from Solanaceae species
available in dbEST [15] (Table 1). In particular, data are
from six species that are members of the genus Solanum
of which four from species of subgenus Lycopersicon; five
species of the genus Nicotiana; two species of the genus
Capsicum and one species belonging to the genus Petunia. We considered also ESTs from two species of the family Rubiaceae genus Coffea, because coffee and tomato
share common gene repertoires, as revealed in [16].

A specific basic tool has been designed to remove over-represented EST sequences from each of the 16 collections in
order to clip the original datasets and produce non-redundant EST collections (Table 1 column 6). These EST collections are independently processed by the ParPEST
pipeline [7] in order to i) group ESTs that tag the same
gene and generate one tentative consensus sequences (TCs)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S2/S7

per putative transcript and ii) determine a preliminary
functional annotation of both ESTs and TCs.
EST sequence databases
The EST database architecture is relational. The database
stores raw EST sequences and library details; clustering
information as well as all the features which describes
EST-alignments within clusters. The EST set in a cluster
can be assembled into multiple TCs [17] so that their
number usually results larger than the number of clusters
(Table 1). The total putative transcripts are created by
combining the TCs and the singleton EST sequences
(sESTs). The putative transcripts are annotated according
to similarity versus protein and RNA family databases. A
standard classification is provided using the Gene Ontology vocabulary [18] and the Enzyme Commission numbers [19]. Specific Web applications allow transcripts to
be dynamically organized into enzyme classes and to be
on-the-fly mapped onto the KEGG metabolic pathways
[20]. Statistics of different sequence categories per species
are reported in table 1. In figure 3 we report information
on the functional annotation concerning the most representative transcript collections, i.e. S. lycopersicum and S.
tuberosum.
Comparing Tomato Genome Array probe-sets to EST sequences
ESTs from S. lycopersicum species are compared to i) the
Affymetrix Tomato Genome Array probe-sets [5] and ii) to
the EST dataset and the cDNA clones which have been
used to build the TOM1 array [6].

Of the 112,528 probes from the Affymetrix Tomato
Genome Array, 101,743 have at least one match with an
EST sequence. However, all the matches accounts for
735,124 hits.

Considering the 17,015 TOM1 cDNA clones, 9,696 are
the number of those sequences that align at least to one
EST sequence. The total number of hits is 1,057,491.
Value-added data-gathering
The higher quality collections obtained by the local data
processing are organized into dedicated repositories and
are provided to the community as value-added data both
through Web applications and FTP services. ISOLA provides: i) the collections of non redundant Solanaceae ESTs
and the corresponding computationally defined transcripts, used to sample the species-specific transcriptome
space; ii) the definition of the Solanaceae proteomes,
including functional annotations and the open reading
frame detection, enriching the still poor collection of
Solanaceae proteins available from general databases; iii)
gene models from tomato, necessary to increase the meagre gene information available to build a training set for
gene predictors [20-22]. In order to obtain a reliable and
number-consistent collection of gene models, we implemented the GeneModelEST software [24], a subsidiary tool
in ISOLA.

GeneModelEST requires the genome coordinates of the
spliced-alignments of ESTs and TCs which have been
independently aligned along the tomato genome draft
sequences. Hence, GeneModelEST detects non-overlapping TC sequences which are consistently supported by
EST alignments and therefore are evidence of expressed
genome regions. These ‘expressed’ loci are considered to
select highly confident gene models. Furthermore, the
software exploits the TC functional annotations stored in
the EST databases, to check if the ‘expressed’ loci represent
full-length products. Overlapping TCs are explored as they
could represent alternative transcripts but are neglected
from the selection of gene models because they provide
ambiguous information.
In the current update of ISOLA, 339 S. lycopersicum TCs
have been selected because consistently supported by EST
evidence [24] and are displayed as additional tracks in the
Gbrowse. Among these TCs, 50 cover at least the 95% of
the length of the most similar protein sequence; 96 at least
the 50%; 145 cover less than the 50% of the matching
protein and the remaining 48 present no significant similarity with any known protein. If the TCs from other
tomato species are considered, further 59 loci are located.
The number accordingly increases to 262 loci if the potato
TC sequences are also evaluated.
Only the TCs covering the 95% of the length of the matching protein are selected as reliable gene models for the
training of gene predictors. They account for a total of 111
gene models.

Discussion
The success of bioinformatics approaches is directly
dependent on the efficiency of data integration and on the
value added information which it produces. This is, in turn,
determined by the diversity of data sources and by the quality of the annotation they are endowed with.
In the light of these significant issues and in order to
approach a systems biology view, we designed a trial computational environment in the framework of the International Solanaceae Genome Project.
ISOLA represents an Italian resource for the genomics of
the SOLAnaceae family. It is conceived to collect the overwhelming amount of data that the ‘-omics’ technologies are
producing in a quest to investigate multiple aspects of a
biological system and tune up bioinformatics methods for
novel challenges.
ISOLA consists of data and tools, and aims to meet the need
to create a core collection of information from worldwide
efforts in order to transform experimental data into biological knowledge. This implies the major effort of enhancing
data quality efficiently and of exploiting data integration.
ISOLA is conceived as a ‘data warehouse’ which summarizes information collected periodically from other data
systems as well as value-added information generated by
the local data processing. The ‘data warehouse’ connects to
the external databases from which data are selectively
downloaded (Figure 1).
The biological semantic is represented in ISOLA through a
multi-level environment which currently consists of two
main levels: the genome and the expression levels.
The expression level is mainly represented by EST data collected from libraries of 16 different plant species. These collections are processed by the basic tool ParPEST and provide
an estimation of the species-specific transcriptome space.
The protein-based EST annotation together with the open
reading frame detection represents an entry point to plague
into the platform data collected from proteomics efforts.
The EST-based collections are organized so to offer the possibility to investigate on different libraries from different
tissues and at different developmental stages. The data/
tools design permits the study of species-specific expression
patterns and their time course, in normal or pathological
conditions and/or under specific biotic or abiotic stimula,
exploiting the large amount of cDNA libraries today available for tomato, potato and other Solanaceae species. In
addition, the link to the KEGG metabolic pathways let
metabolome data be integrated in ISOLA so to further support the definition of expression patterns.

Furthermore the genome level is enriched with the annotation of all the gene types (mRNA and non protein coding
RNAs), the repeats (simple and complex ones) and other
relevant features. In particular, the integration with the
wealth collection of pre-annotated data derived from ESTs
represents a valuable resource for an efficient analysis and
functional annotation of the daily uploaded BAC
sequences. In addition, it permits genome-based comparative analyses of the Solanaceae transcriptomes.

the user-driven investigations and the biological knowledge discovery. As an example, in the expression level, raw
EST sequence data are maintained to provide the user with
information concerning the quality of the cDNA libraries.
In order to permit investigations on putative alternative
transcripts, the organization of each cluster (made up of
ESTs which tag the same gene) into multiple TCs is available. This provides added value that will further support
genome investigations.

To provide a well-founded genome annotation, we are considering only evidence from experimental approaches or
from reference databases, neglecting results from gene predictions. Indeed, gene predictors still need to be trained on
a consistent set of tomato gene models. The definition of a
good quality and representative data set of gene models is
one of the tasks of the international Tomato Annotation
Group and a preliminary requirement for the training of ab
initio gene predictors. Gene models represent a value-added
information that can be elicited from the effective integration of the main levels of the platform. As an example, GeneModelEST, a subsidiary tool in the platform, collects
putative alternative transcripts from the ESTs/TCs aligned
to the genome and automatically selects high reliable gene
models. The availability in ISOLA of expressed sequence
collections from other Solanaceae species also contributes
to enrich the number of possible coding regions in the
tomato genome and to support comparative genomic studies.

Conclusions

The mapping of oligonucleotide probes to the tomato
genome as well as to the transcriptome is an entry point to
plague into the platform data from expression profiling
arrays. This corroborates gene expression studies and supports as the cross-validation of expression patterns derived
from microarray analysis, as the detection of network of coexpressed genes derived from EST-based investigations.
The probes-to-genome mapping provides also support for
their evaluation. Indeed results demonstrate the non-specificity of some probes and also highlight the presence of
probes which are not confirmed by experimentally defined
transcripts.
ISOLA can be accessed through two different gateways: the
Genome Browser gateway which permits investigations on
the BAC sequences and the EST databases gateway for
exploring the EST/transcript resources by friendly and flexible interfaces. Both gateways provide access points to the
respective levels which are, in turn, cross-linked to support
the Web-based navigation (Figure 2).
One of the major efforts in ISOLA is to maintain details of
information from all the analytical processes that are part
of the platform. This with the purpose to further support

ISOLA is based on the collection of the large amount of
data produced in the frame of the Solanaceae Genome
Project. It represents an Italian effort to integrate heterogeneous data at the semantic as well as at the data source levels. It aims to enhance the quality of the data gathered and
to self feed by the value-added information produced.
The platform is becoming a reference within the Solanaceae
Genome Project.
ISOLA is daily accessed from scientists from different countries because it provides a preliminary annotation of the
tomato genome, while awaiting for the official annotation
by the international Tomato Annotation Group. Furthermore, the platform collects and distributes the Solanaceae
transcripts, provides their functional annotation and classification, and allows investigations on genome functionalities on the basis of EST supported expression pattern
analysis.
Since ISOLA is designed as a multi-level computational
environment, it is thought to be flexible and to easily
evolve in consideration of the continuous production of
new data and novel methods. In addition, ISOLA meets the
need to collect, integrate and explore high-throughput biological data in the context of various experiments from
multiple organisms. This surely will support successful
analysis based on comparative approaches.
Among different platforms for plant genomics, ISOLA represents a novel effort where EST-based functional information is cross-linked to genome data and vice versa, and
details are maintained because they are relevant in revealing still hidden biological aspects. Therefore, we believe
that the approach here proposed, aimed to support investigations on the structure, the function and the evolution of
the Solanaceae genomes, could represent a suitable test
bench for similar challenges.

Methods
Data sources
1. BAC sequences were downloaded from the GenBank
repository.

2. EST sequences were downloaded from the dbEST division of the NCBI.

permit their uploading into the local Genome Browser
Database.

3. FASTA sequences of Rfam members (version 8.0) were
downloaded at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam/
ftp.shtml. The collection includes 45,644 sequences.

Transcriptome sampling
We used ParPEST [7] to pre-process, cluster, assemble and
annotate ESTs from Solanaceae species.

4. The file TIGR_Solanaceae_Repeats.v2 was downloaded
from
the
ftp
server
ftp://ftp.tigr.org/pub/data/
TIGR_Plant_Repeats/. The file is a collection of 252 repetitive sequences reporting transposable, telomere-related,
rDNAs and unclassified elements. No centromere-related
repeats are included in the collection.

ESTs and TCs are collected into dedicated repositories
whose features are described in [17]. The annotation of the
expressed sequences is based on the use of controlled
vocabularies such as the Gene Ontologies [18] and the
Enzyme Commission numbers [19] and the ‘on the fly’
mapping of the expressed sequences [17] onto known metabolic pathways from KEGG [20]. The annotation pipeline
includes the analysis of non coding RNAs from RNAfam [8]
and, for each tomato EST, a link to the identification numbers of TOM1, the reference cDNA microarray for Tomato
[6], and to the probe set of the Affymetrix Tomato Genome
Array [5].

5. The Tomato Affymetrix probe sequence file was retrieved
from
http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/
byproduct.affx?product=tomato. The collection includes
112,528 oligonucleotide probes.
6. The TOM1 cDNA microarray sequences data were kindly
provided by Jim Giovannoni on March 2006. The collection includes 17,015 sequences.
7.
The
files
NC_003070.frn,
NC_003071.frn,
NC_003074.frn, NC_003075.frn and NC_003076.frn were
downloaded from the genome session of the NCBI ftp
server in order to collect all the RNA from Arabidopsis thaliana. A total of 31,249 RNA sequences were retrieved.
BAC sequences retrieval and annotation pipeline
The automated pipeline, that downloads and annotates the
BACs which are released to GenBank from the Tomato
Genome Sequencing Consortium, is composed of several
Perl scripts. Each script enables a specific task inside the
pipeline. Using BioPerl an Entrez query is formulated to the
NCBI web services system. The query is daily performed to
select all the tomato BAC sequences to be retrieved as they
represent novel submissions to GenBank or modified
records. The pipeline checks, via BAC identifier (i.e. accession.version), if the sequences are already annotated and
deposited into the local Genome Browser Database. The
retrieved BACs are used to feed into the annotation pipeline.

The mapping of ESTs/TCs, cDNAs, RNAs and expression
array probes is performed by GenomeThreader [25]. The
parameter settings fixed the percent identity threshold to
90%, the percent coverage to 80% and, in case of EST/
mRNAs the poly-A tail masking is applied.
The identification of simple and complex repeats is performed by RepeatMasker [26] using the SGN tomato
UniRepeats [27] as filtering database. Two distinct Perl
script converts the results of the GenomeThreader as well as
the RepeatMasker analysis into the GFF3 [28] format to
