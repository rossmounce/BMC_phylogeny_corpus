Abstract

Genome Biology 2006, 7:R75

information

Conclusion: Evolutionary models indicate that total genomic GC content, probably the product
of directional mutation pressure, drives codon usage rather than the converse, a conclusion that is
supported by examination of nematode genomes.

interactions

Results: Codon usage similarity in Nematoda usually persists over the breadth of a genus but then
rapidly diminishes even within each clade. Globodera, Meloidogyne, Pristionchus, and Strongyloides have
the most highly derived patterns of codon usage. The major factor affecting differences in codon
usage between species is the coding sequence GC content, which varies in nematodes from 32%
to 51%. Coding GC content (measured as GC3) also explains much of the observed variation in
the effective number of codons (R = 0.70), which is a measure of codon bias, and it even accounts
for differences in amino acid frequency. Codon usage is also affected by neighboring nucleotides
(N1 context). Coding GC content correlates strongly with estimated noncoding genomic GC
content (R = 0.92). On examining abundant clusters in five species, candidate optimal codons were
identified that may be preferred in highly expressed transcripts.

refereed research

Background: Codon usage has direct utility in molecular characterization of species and is also a
marker for molecular evolution. To understand codon usage within the diverse phylum Nematoda,
we analyzed a total of 265,494 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from 30 nematode species. The full
genomes of Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae were also examined. A total of 25,871,325 codons
were analyzed and a comprehensive codon usage table for all species was generated. This is the
first codon usage table available for 24 of these organisms.

Background

Utilization of the degenerate triplet code for amino acid (AA)
translation is neither uniform nor random. In particular,
there are distinct patterns among different species and genes.
Such patterns can readily be characterized by codon usage,
namely the observed percentage occurrence with which each
codon is used to encode a given AA. This measure has direct
utility in molecular characterization of a species in that it enables efficient degenerate and nondegenerate primer design
for cross-species gene cloning, open reading frame determination, and optimal protein expression [1]. Such tools are
particularly important with respect to species for which limited molecular information exists. Codon usage also serves as
an indicator of molecular evolution [2]. Codon usage bias,
namely the degree to which usage departs from uniform use
of all available codons for an AA, can be influenced by a
number of evolutionary processes. The guanine and cytosine
(GC) versus adenine and thymine (AT) composition of the
species' genome, probably the product of directional mutation pressure [3,4], is a key driver of both codon usage and AA
composition [5,6]. Other factors that influence codon usage
may include the relative abundance of isoaccepting tRNAs [79], especially for highly expressed mRNAs that require translational efficiency [10,11], presence of mRNA secondary
structure [12,13], and facilitation of correct co-translational
protein folding [14]. Codon usage appears not to be optimized
to minimize the impact of errors in translation and replication [15].
Nematodes are a highly abundant and diverse group of organisms that exploit niches from free-living microbivory to plant
and animal parasitism. Molecular phylogenies divide nematodes into five major named and numbered clades within
which parasitism has arisen multiple times [16]: Dorylaimia
(clade I), Enoplia (clade II), Spirurina (clade III), Tylenchina
(clade IV), and Rhabditina (clade V). Following the sequencing of the complete genome of the model nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans [17], we have begun to catalog the
molecular diversity of nematode genomes through the generation of over 250,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from
more than 30 nematode species (including 28 parasites) in
four clades. Gene expression analyses for several medically
and economically important parasites such as filarial, hookworm, and root knot nematode species have been completed
[18-23] (for reviews [24,25]). Moreover, we recently conducted a meta-analysis of partial genomes across the whole
phylum with a focus on the conservation and diversification
of encoded protein families [26]. Project information is maintained on several online resources [27-30].
Now, in the most extensive such study yet performed for any
phylum, we extend the above analyses with a comprehensive
survey of observed codon usage and bias based on nearly 26
million codons in 32 species of the Nematoda. Because of its
completed genome, C. elegans has been the primary species
utilized in nematode codon usage studies [31-34]. Our find-

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/8/R75

ings provide more complete information for Caenorhabditis
based on all 41,782 currently predicted proteins in C. elegans
and C. briggsae [35]. Studies for other nematode species have
been more limited. Codon usage has been tabulated for a
number of parasitic nematodes including filarial species Brugia malayi, Onchocerca volvulus, Wucheria bancrofti, Acanthocheilonema viteae, Dirofilaria immitis [36-39],
Strongyloides stercoralis [40], Ascaris suum [41], Ancylostoma caninum, and Necator americanus [42]. Although
Fadiel and coworkers [39] used up to 60 genes per species,
sample sizes in the other studies were quite small, typically
fewer than 10 representative genes and 5,000 codons per species. In the present study we used an average of 2,350 genes
and 270,000 codons per species for the 30 non-Caenorhabditis species. Our results provide the first codon usage tables
for 24 of these organisms. Web available automated codon
usage databases compiled from GenBank [43] lack almost all
of this information because they rely only on full-length protein coding gene sequence submissions rather than the EST
data used here.
In analyzing codon distribution in Nematoda, we describe
how average usage varies between species and across the phylum. For instance, it has been shown that there is a level of
conservation in codon distribution between 'closely' related
nematodes such as Brugia malayi and B. pahangi [37] and
Brugia and Onchocerca [38]. These relationships do not
appear to extend over greater evolutionary distances, for
instance between Onchocerca and Caenorhabditis [36]. The
evolutionary distance at which conservation of codon usage
diminishes has not previously been established [32]. Here we
show that codon usage similarity in Nematoda is a relatively
short-range phenomenon, generally persisting over the
breadth of a genus but then rapidly diminishing within each
clade. We also show that the major factor affecting differences
in mean codon usage between distantly related species is the
coding sequence GC as compared with AT content. GC content also explains much of the observed variation in the effective number of codons, a measure of codon bias, and even
differences in AA frequency.

Results
Determination of codon usage patterns and amino acid
composition
Extensive nucleotide sequence data are now available for
many nematode species, largely because of recent progress
using genomic approaches [25,44]. To obtain a better understanding of codon usage and AA composition within the phylum Nematoda, we analyzed a total of 265,494 EST sequences
originating from 30 nematode species. The ESTs define
93,645 clusters or putative genes, with 208-9,511 clusters per
species (Table 1) [26]. Table 1 also provides two letter codes
for the nematode species used throughout the remainder of
the report. We used prot4EST, a translation prediction pipeline optimized for EST datasets [45], to generate protein

information

To examine these variables independent of species relatedness, correlations were calculated using phylogenetically
independent contrasts (see Materials and methods, below).
The variances of the contrasts were computed for each character as a measure of the variance accumulating per unit
branch length. The branch lengths were estimated from the
maximum likelihood phylogeny assuming a molecular clock
(Figure 1); by this criterion, the tips of the tree are all equidistant in branch length from its root. Computed contrasts were
plotted in all figures representing pair-wise comparisons, and
the correlation coefficients were calculated from the paired
contrasts. This method is robust to changes in molecular

predictions. To reduce noise derived from poor translations,
our analysis considered only the longest open reading frame
(ORF) translations with strong supporting evidence in the
form of similarity to known or predicted proteins (BLASTX
cutoff 1 × e-8) and retained only the polypeptide aligned portion of the nucleotide sequence. About 75% of the clusters met
these criteria, yielding 8,080,057 codons originating from
species other than Caenorhabditis, and 25,871,325 total
codons from all 32 species including available predictions
from C. elegans and C. briggsae. The 18 AA residues with
redundant codons gave a total of (18) × C32,2 = 496 comparisons of codon usage between species. Comprehensive tables
of AA composition (Tables 2 and 3) and codon usage (Table 4)
for all 32 Nematoda species studied are provided. Below we
use these tables to examine, first, variation in AA composition

clock assumptions. (Trees calculated without the assumption
of a molecular clock are similar in topology but differ in
rooting, and branch lengths vary according to amount of base
substitution in the 18S rRNA; the clock-based tree provides
branch lengths that should estimate most closely the relative
durations of branches in evolutionary time. Because independent contrasts are influenced mainly by relative branch
lengths, our results should be robust to alternative placements of the root.)

Amino acid composition of nematode proteins and
relationship to GC content
AA composition of predicted proteins in nematodes varies
among species within a narrow window and is similar to that
observed in other organisms (Tables 2 and 3). (Standard deviations in AA usage among nematodes range from 5% to 15%

of mean usage, and mean nematode AA usage differs from the
mean of four representative organisms by an average of 8%.)
Across nematodes, Leu is the most common AA (8.8% of all
codons) and Trp the least common (1.1%). Eight AAs contribute an average of more than 6% each to AA content (Ile, Gly,
Val, Glu, Ala, Lys, Ser, and Leu); these AAs are also among the
most common in the proteomes of other representative species, including humans (Table 3). As in other taxa [46],
nematodes show a correlation between AA usage and the
degree of codon degeneracy (R = 0.72).
In nematodes, coding sequence GC content, derived from our
EST clusters, varies from 32% to 51% (Table 1) among species,
with a mean of 43.6 ± 5.9%. The distribution is biphasic, with
a peak at 36% GC and a second peak at 48%. Strongyloides

Codon usage patterns and relationships to sampling
method, nematode phylogeny, and GC content
Similarity in codon usage was quantified and reported as D100

Because analyses
based on EST-derived partial genomes [26], comparisons
were performed to estimate the differences in codon usage
pattern that could be expected using EST collections versus
gene predictions derived from a fully assembled and annotated genome. Using C. elegans, parallel analyses were performed using either all 22,254 predicted gene products or two
EST datasets (CE-A and CE-B) each comprising 10,000 ESTs.
Clustering and peptide predictions were performed using the
same algorithms as for the other 30 species. The average D100

interactions

parasites (BM, DI, and OV) are the most AT rich (low GC);
and NB, PP, and cyst nematodes (GP, GR, and HG) are the
most GC rich (approximately 50%). The variation observed in
AA composition among species shows a clear relationship to
the species' coding sequence GC content. The frequency of
AAs encoded by WWN codons (AA, AT, TA, or TT in the first
and second nucleotide positions; Asn, Ile, Lys, Try, Phe, and
Met) decreases with increasing coding sequence GC content
(Figure 2a), whereas the proportion of AAs encoded by SSN
codons (GG, GC, CG, and CC; Ala, Arg, Pro, and Gly) increases
with higher coding sequence GC content (Figure 2b), and
these relationships remain even after removing the effect of
evolutionary relationships using phylogenetically independent contrasts. Among AAs, the most uniform and precipitous
decrease with increasing GC content was seen with Ile and
Tyr whereas the most uniform and rapid increase with higher
GC content was seen with Ala and Arg. The trend is less pronounced for other AAs (flatter slope, lower R value). Thr,
encoded by four GC/AT 'balanced' codons (ACN), exhibits no
change in its frequency with changing GC content (data not
shown).

Clickvariation 1
Additionalfor file
The here file observed in GC usage by codon position among
species exhibits a clear relationship to the species' overall
coding sequence GC content. Not surprisingly, both GC1 and
GC2 composition increase with higher coding sequence GC3
content (Figure 3). Specifically, species with high AT content
like root-knot Meloidogyne species (MI, MJ, and so on) and
filarial worms (BM, DI, and OV) [38,39] are biased toward
codons terminating in A or T, whereas species with higher GC
content such as NB, PP, cyst nematodes, and whipworms (TM
and TV) prefer codons ending with G or C. Differences in calculated GC composition by codon position (1-3) between
species are determined both by the species' AA usage (as
described above) and the codons used for each AA. For example, Cys was encoded by TGT as much as 85% of the time for
the AT-rich Strongyloides genomes, whereas TGC was used
up to 60% of the time in GC-rich genomes such as NB, PP, and
HG. To compare codon usage more systematically for individual AAs between species, we employed a statistical approach
(described in Materials and Methods and in the following
section).

Codon usage in nematode species was examined by several
methods, including comparison of base usage by position (13) over all AAs and comparison of codon usage within each
AA. Over all AAs, purine (AG) and pyrimidine (TC) usage in
positions 1, 2, and 3 is remarkably uniform between species,
favoring purines in position 1 (AG 59.6 ± 1.5%), near equal
usage in position 2 (AG 50.0 ± 0.8%), and pyrimidines in
position 3 (AG 47.9 ± 1.5%; Additional data file 1). Similar values were observed in Schistosoma mansoni (AG 61%, 53%,
and 48% in positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively) [1]. GC versus
AT usage also varies by position but with much greater variance, with near equal usage in position 1 (50.3% GC) and
lower GC usage in positions 2 and 3 (39.1 and 41.4%, respectively), mainly due to greater use of G in position 1 and T in
positions 2 and 3 [4].

information

The 16 intragenus comparisons of species sharing the same
genus name (Ancylostoma, Caenorhabditis, Strongyloides,
Globodera, Meloidogyne, Ascaris, and Trichuris) all have
low D100 values, with a mean of 0.14 ± 0.11 (median 0.09,
range 0.02-0.40), indicating very similar patterns of codon
usage among species within the same genera. By contrast, the
480 comparisons beyond named genera vary greatly, with a
mean D100 value of 8.10 ± 7.46 (median 5.26, range 0.0840.56). Low D100 values do sometimes extend to comparisons
among genera. For instance, relatively low D100 values (0.081.94) are observed within the following: order Haemonchidae
(HC, OO, and TD); subfamily Heteroderinae (GP, GR, and
HG); superfamily Ascaridoidea (AS, AL, and TC); and superfamily Filarioidea (BM, DI, and OV). However, low D100 values are not maintained across family Ancylostomatidae (NA,
AC, and AY), family Strongyloididae (SS, SR, and PT), superfamily Tylenchoidea (PE-MC), and order Trichocephalida
(TS, TM, and TV). Similarity in codon usage, as indicated by
low D100 values, does not extend to the level of the major
clades (I, III, IVb, IVa, and V).

interactions

value for the comparison of codon usage pattern between the
CE-A and CE-B datasets was 0.18, which was not statistically
different at the P < 0.05 threshold and less than the D100 value
of the C. elegans to C. briggsae comparison (0.40). Comparing the CE-A and CE-B datasets to the genome-derived full
gene set for C. elegans yielded average D100 values of 0.67 and
0.26, respectively. At a practical level, the calculated use of
the average codon in C. elegans based on CE-A and CE-B differs from that based on prediction from the whole genome by
just 3.4 ± 2.3% and 2.0 ± 1.5%, respectively. Therefore,
although differences in calculated codon usage using partial
versus whole genome data are modest enough to make ESTderived codon usage data highly informative, care must be
taken not to over-interpret minor differences in D100 values
because such differences are probably within the range of
sampling error (see Discussion, below). However, such
uncertainty around small differences in D100 values does not
alter the major trends that we describe.

Furthermore, species with very similar GC content, although
distantly related, can exhibit extremely similar codon usage
(for instance Ancylostoma caninum versus Toxocara canis,
GC = 48%, D100 = 0.79). Species with the lowest average D100
values in one-versus-all comparisons are those closest to the
median species GC content, such as PE (GC = 46%). Taxa with
the highest AT content, such as Strongyloides and Meloidogyne species, have among the most extreme differences in
codon usage when compared with species beyond their genus
(median D100 values are 15.3 and 9.4, respectively).
Phylogenetic analysis of changes in codon usage using (1 antilog [-D]) × 100, interpretable as percentage divergence in
overall codon usage (Figure 1), identifies five branches that
have accumulated more than 5% change in codon usage.
These branches are as follows: the most recent common
ancestor of clades III, IVa, and IVb (5.2%); the most recent
common ancestor of clade IVa (11.2%); the most recent common ancestor of genus Meloidogyne (6.7%); the most recent
common ancestor of genus Globodera (7.3%); and the lineage
represented by PP (8.3%). Genera Globodera, Meloidogyne,
Pristionchus, and Strongyloides therefore represent the most
highly derived patterns of codon usage in nematodes, with the
remaining species exhibiting less relatively divergence from
an ancestral nematode pattern.

Codon bias in nematode transcripts and relationship to
GC content
We used the effective number of codons (ENC) to measure the
degree of codon bias for a gene [49]. ENC is a general measure
of non-uniformity of codon usage and ranges from 20 if only
one codon is used for each AA to 61 if all synonymous codons
are used equally. The mean ENC across all sampled nematode
species is 46.7 ± 5.1, and many nematodes have ENC values
similar to those obtained for various bacteria, yeast, and Drosophila species (ENCs of 45-48) [50]. Outliers with low ENC
values include SS and SR, for which transcripts on average
utilize only about 35 of 61 available codons. The variation
observed in ENC values among species exhibits a clear relationship to the species' overall coding sequence GC3 content
(R = 0.70 following phylogenetic correction; Figure 4). The
correlation confirms that species with lower GC3 content in
coding sequence have greater codon usage bias than those
with higher GC3. ENC values for nematodes peak at 47-49%
GC (data not shown). In addition to comparing species' mean
ENC values, we also examined the distribution of ENC values
across all transcripts within each species. Although all species
have examples of transcripts across nearly the full range of
possible ENC values, in species with low GC3 content, such as
SR, the distribution is shifted toward a lower ENC peak
(Additional data file 3).

To ensure that

cies (for instance, cluster number and cluster length) were not
creating artifacts in ENC values, quality checks were performed. Unlike measures such as codon bias index, scaled ×2,

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/8/R75

and intrinsic codon bias index, ENC values should be independent of translated polypeptide length and sample size
[49,51], and our analysis confirmed this. No correlation with
ENC was observed with either average translated polypeptide
length or number of clusters for a species. In fact, SS and SR
with the lowest ENC values had above average cluster length
and number. As additional confirmation, we randomly
selected 2,400 C. elegans genes (the average number of
clusters for species other than CE and CB) and calculated
ENC based on either full-length genes or genes trimmed to
121 AAs (the average length cluster translation for species
other than CE and CB). Differences in the average ENC numbers for these datasets were not statistically significantly different from zero (P > 0.05).
In addition to codon bias, neighboring nucleotides influence
the codon observed at a position relative to synonymous
codons. The most important nucleotide determining such
context dependent codon bias [52-54] is the first one
following the codon (N1 context) [55,56]. An analysis using
the complete genesets of Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, C. elegans, and Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that
90% of codons have a statistically significant N1 contextdependent codon bias [57]. Using the same method we calculated that, for the 30 nematode species represented by ESTderived codon data, an average of 63% of codons with N1 context have a statistically significant bias (because the R values
differed from 1 by more than 3 standard deviations). Fedorov
and colleagues [57] showed that their results were not considerably affected by gene sampling. However, for our dataset
the calculated CE-A and CE-B N1 context with statistically
significant bias was 75% and 83% of the codons, respectively,
as compared with 96% when the complete C. elegans gene set
was used. Therefore, the extent of significant N1 contextdependent codon bias determined from EST-based codon
usage data may change as more complete nematode genomes
become available. The complete list of relative abundance of
all nematode species with N1 context, R values, and standard
deviations are available in Additional data file 4.

Coding sequence GC content versus total genome GC

Because of the clear relationships of AA composition, codon
usage pattern, and codon bias to the GC content of coding
sequences and the interest in the underlying cause of these
correlations (see Discussion, below), we examined the relationship between coding sequence GC3 content and genomic
GC content in nematodes. Total genomic GC content was calculated for the six nematode species for which significant
genome sequence data were available as unassembled
sequences (TS and HC), partial assemblies (BM and AC), or
finished assemblies (CE and CB). Noncoding genomic GC
content was calculated for CB and CE based on published estimates of the percentage of each genome that is composed of
noncoding sequence, namely 74.5% and 77.1%, respectively
[35]. Extrapolations were made for other species using the CE

across the genome for some organisms (for example, isochors
in vertebrates [58]), GC content is fairly uniform across the C.

correlation was observed between coding GC3 content and
both total GC content and extrapolated noncoding GC content (R = 0.92; Figure 5). Noncoding genomic sequences varied across a wider span of GC values than did coding

Correlations between GC content and mean codon usage and
mean AA usage similar to those we describe across the phylum Nematoda have been observed in many other species
[4,65-70]. Directional mutation pressure is a theory proposed
to quantify differences in GC content observed in species [3].
Important variables include the relative values of the mutation rates u (GC/CG → AT/TA change) and v (AT/TA → GC/
CG change). The preponderance of the evidence supports
causality of genome GC content, as determined by directional
mutation pressure or nucleotide level selective pressure,
driving both codon usage and AA composition rather than the
reverse. First, in an examination of sequence data from a
large number of a bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, a model
assuming directional mutation and selection at the nucleotide
level with different rates of change for each of the three codon
positions can explain 71-87% of the variance in codon usage

refereed research

A comprehensive and well supported codon usage table for 32
nematode species across most of the phylum's major clades
and based on nearly 26 million codons is now available. Use
of large EST datasets provide an excellent resource for determining a species mean codon usage with results that differ
only modestly from those obtained from full genomes. In
nematodes, codon usage varies widely, as does coding and
noncoding GC content of nematode genomes. GC content correlates with AA usage, similarity of codon usage, and codon
bias. Codon usage similarity in Nematoda usually persists
within a genus but then rapidly diminishes, even within each
major clade (clades I-V). Based on EST sampling, differences
in codon usage between highly abundant genes and moderately expressed genes are recognizable, and candidate optimal codons can be identified.

ESTs, we selected five species, each of which is a member of a
different clade. The selected species (AY, MI, OV, SR, and TS)
were represented by approximately 3,000 clusters each
(range 2,693-3,214), and codon usage tables were generated
for subsets of genes from each species: the 20 most abundant
clusters versus all remaining clusters, and the 50 most abundant clusters versus all remaining clusters. Results of both
comparisons were similar, and for simplicity we discuss only
the results based on the comparison of the 50 most abundant
versus all remaining clusters. Clusters 51 to about can be
described as containing mainly genes with low to moderate
expression because transcripts of extremely low abundance
are less likely to be represented in EST collections (for
instance, neuronal 7-transmembrane receptors). Codon
usage tables, AA frequencies, and relative differences
between AA usage of the most abundant and less abundant
genes are available in Additional data file 5.

in each species was generally similar for genes represented by
abundant EST clusters and genes represented by low to
moderate expression EST clusters. SR exhibited the greatest
difference between the two usage patterns (D100 = 6.15).
Additionally, for all the species at least seven AAs were used
significantly more frequently in the abundant genes than in
the remainder of the genes. For example, although the
abundant OV clusters had a Pro composition of 10.5% of all
AAs, the rest of the clusters were only 4.4% Pro.

The green line indicates the coding sequence %GC versus the full genomic
%GC. In this case, coding sequence %GC3 is a contributor to the full
genomic %GC such that X and Y are not independent variables. The red
line indicates the coding sequence %GC3 versus noncoding genomic %GC.
In this case, the coding sequence contribution has been removed from
genomic totals such that X and Y are independent variables. For BM, TS,
HC, and AC, the calculation of noncoding genomic %GC relies on the
assumption that the species will have a similar breakdown of coding and
noncoding sequence as CE. Assembly and gene calling for the BM, HC, TS,
and AC sequences are needed to test this assumption. Definitions of
species two letter codes are provided in Table 1.

Examining the codon usage frequencies within an AA, an
increase in usage has been noted with higher gene expression
for specific so-called 'optimal' codons [62,63]. Using the
codon usage tables for the top 50 and remaining clusters, we
have defined a list of potentially optimal codons with usage
that is higher in abundant transcripts by a statistically significant measure. Out of the 59 synonymous codons there were
24, 28, 25, 27, and 23 candidate optimal codons (Table 5) in
AY, MI, OV, SR, and TS, respectively. For example, Tyr is
encoded by two codons (TAC and TAT); in AY TAC is used
75% of the time in the abundant clusters and 59% of the time
in the less abundant clusters. Similar analysis documented
about 21 candidate optimal codons in C. elegans for which
usage differed significantly when comparing high and low
expressed genes [31,33,64]. Confirmation of these candidate
codons as truly 'optimal' will require additional
investigations, including other means of verifying relative
expression levels (for example, microarrays and reverse transcription [RT]-polymerase chain reaction [PCR]).

and 71-79% of the variance in AA composition [5]. Knight and
coworkers [5] found that between species an AA's change in
frequency in response to GC content is determined by the
mean GC content of its codons, whereas a codon's change in
frequency is determined by the difference between its GC content and the mean GC content of its synonyms. We observe
this result to be generally true across nematodes as well.
Second, an analysis comparing codon usage from eubacterial
and archaeal species with complete genomes [6] found that
codon usage can be predicted with some accuracy if one
knows only the sequence of the species' intergenic sequences
from which genome GC content, and context dependent
nucleotide bias parameters can be calculated. Using data

from six nematode species for which substantial genome
sequence data are available, we observed that coding
sequence GC3 content correlates with noncoding sequence
GC content. This perhaps indicates that, for nematodes too, it
should be possible to predict mean codon usage using only
knowledge of the intergenic sequences of the species. Our
findings are consistent with the model that genome GC content drives both mean codon usage and AA composition.
Little is known about why directional mutation pressure or
selective pressure leads to differences in genomic GC content
among species [5,6]. Within nematodes we see no pattern
based on ecologic niche or other factors that corresponds to
GC content. For instance, cyst nematodes (GP, GR, and HG)

and root knot nematodes (MI, MJ, MA, MH, and MC) have
similar life cycles as plant sedentary endoparasites, but their
coding sequence GC contents are completely different
(approximately 50% versus 36%). Whatever the driving
forces, it is important for nematologists to note that they are
sufficiently strong not only to change base composition in
wobble sites (third position) but also to alter first and second
codon positions and even AA sequences - features that are
sometimes assumed to be under selective pressure for
conservation.

rently lack knowledge of tRNA gene copy number, and
information on gene expression levels is largely limited to
estimations based on EST abundance. Here, we have
provided candidate optimal codons in AY, MI, OV, SR, and
TS. A more detailed examination of codon usage as it relates
to gene expression level in other nematodes will be possible
by taking advantage of microarray and RF-PCR confirmation
of transcript abundance.

Species' mean codon usage versus optimal codons in
abundantly expressed genes

The extent to which average nematode genes sequences are
susceptible to GC or AT shifts should sound a cautionary note
for phylogenetic studies of nematode species, genes, and proteins based solely on coding sequences because convergent
evolution may create confusing results. Knight and coworkers
[5] noted that, 'Pairs of species with convergent GC contents
might also evolve convergent protein sequences, especially at
functionally unconstrained positions. For example, the
frequencies of both lysine and arginine are highly (but oppositely) correlated with GC content, and lysine and arginine
can easily substitute for one another in proteins.' In
nematodes as well, one can envision exchanges of Lys and Arg
(Figure 2).

reviews

For cloning genes of interest from various nematode species,
we found that codon usage is a rapidly evolving feature such
that codon usage patterns beyond within a genus
comparisons are often divergent. Therefore, extrapolating
assumed codon usage patterns to unsampled species in nematodes beyond the genus level is unlikely to be successful. At
a practical level of species choice, cloning of orthologs and
homologs of interest from species that are AT rich and have
low ENC values, such as SS and MI with low ENC values, will
require fewer degenerate primers than may be needed for
more GC rich species such as TC and MI. Transcript abundance is also an important factor because genes suspected of
high level expression are likely to exhibit a shift in their codon
usage from the species average toward optimal codons
selected for translational efficiency.

Conclusion

interactions

Extensive sequence datasets from one complete, one draft,
and 30 partial genomes across the phylum Nematoda have
been used to analyze the conservation and diversification of
encoded protein families [26] and the factors effecting codon
usage and bias (the present report). The undertaken comprehensive survey of observed codon usage and bias is based on
26 million codons in 32 species, making it the most extensive
study for any phylum. Our data indicate that similarity
between species in average codon usage is a short range phenomenon, generally rapidly diminishing beyond the genus
level. Mapping codon usage changes to the phyla indicates the
genera Globodera, Meloidogyne, Pristionchus, and Strongyloides have the most highly derived patterns of codon usage in

Therefore, in C. elegans different pictures emerge of evolutionary forces acting on codons and AAs in low to moderately
expressed genes (directional mutation pressure, genome GC
content) compared with abundantly expressed genes (optimal codons, tRNA copy number). In other nematodes, it is
possible that a similar dichotomy exists, although we cur-

refereed research

Prior studies of C. elegans codon usage have examined codon
usage and the role of 'optimal codons' in putatively abundantly expressed genes [31,33,64]. Stenico and coworkers
[31] observed differences between usage of specific codons
based on 168 known genes, including many highly expressed
transcripts (for instance, actin, myosin, collagen, and vitellogenin), and 90 unidentified reading frames (URFs) emerging
from sequencing efforts presumed to represent a more 'random sampling' of the genome. Overall, our codon usage
results based on the full C. elegans genome are similar to both
the results from Stenico and coworkers' 168 known genes
(D100 = 0.97) and the 90 URFs (D100 = 1.1). Duret and coworkers [33] weighted 15,425 C. elegans genes for expression
levels based on their EST abundance and identified 21 favored
codons used most frequently in highly expressed genes. In all
cases, these optimal codons could be decoded by isoaccepting
tRNAs that had the highest gene copy number in the genome,
indicating that optimal codons are probably selected for
translational efficiency. Likewise, Kanaya and coworkers [64]
showed that, in C. elegans, ribosomal proteins and histones,
selected as representatives of highly expressed genes, also use
optimal codons different from those used by average genes
and that these optimal codons correspond to tRNA gene copy
number. AA frequencies in abundant C. elegans genes also
correspond to isoaccepting tRNA gene copy number (R2 =
0.67) [33].

reports

Our use of thousands of genes per species without weighting
for abundance of expression has produced a codon usage
dataset that probably reflects codon usage for genes with low
to moderate abundance of mRNAs. In the case of C. elegans
and C. briggsae, our codon usage table reflects the mean of all
predicted genes, although this is similar to that observed
based on sampling of 10,000 ESTs. At this 'genome-wide'
level, genome GC content is a dominant factor. However,
codon usage within a species does vary from gene to gene.

nematodes, with the remaining species exhibiting less
relatively divergence from an ancestral nematode pattern.
There was a strong correlation between the exonic GC content
and similarity in codon usage. GC content also explains much
of the observed variation in the effective number of codons, a
measure of codon bias, and even differences in AA frequency.
Results from partial genomes assembled from ESTs and complete genomes provide generally good agreement on codon
usage, although refinement will be necessary as more
sequences become available. EST collections from five species
have also been used as a starting point to identify potentially
abundant genes and predict optimal codons. These predictions will also be refined using more accurate measures of
gene expression, including microarrays and quantitative RTPCR.

Materials and methods
Sequence acquisition and organization
To perform the first meta-analysis of the genomic biology of
the phylum Nematoda [26], ESTs from 30 nematode species
generated by our laboratories and others were downloaded
from the dbEST division of GenBank in May 2003. For consistency, in this accompanying analysis of codon usage we
used this dataset for all analyses. Sequences were collated and
processed into partial genomes using the PartiGene pipeline
[71,72]. Polypeptide translations were predicted using
prot4EST [45,72]. Wormpep_dna121 (March 2004; Welcome
Trust Sanger Institute, unpublished data) was used for C. elegans analysis, and the hybrid gene set [35] was used for C.
briggsae analysis. Mitochondria can have codon usage differing from that of the nuclear genome, and therefore protein
coding genes from mitochondrial genomes were eliminated
from consideration. Codon usage tables for human, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Escherichia coli were derived from
the Codon Usage Table Database [73] derived from GenBank
Release 140.0 (22 March 2004 [74]).

Phylogenetic correction
Analyses of the relationships among GC content, AA, and
codon usage values require statistical correction for the phylogenetic relatedness of the species being studied using phylogenetically independent contrasts [75]. To generate these
contrasts, we performed the following procedures. First, to
construct a phylogenetic tree independent of the transcriptomic data analyzed in this paper, we aligned 18S ribosomal
RNA sequences using Clustalw [76] for all nematodes for
which more than 15 kilobases of sequence was available. The
18S sequence GenBank accession numbers are available in
Figure 1; the sequences from a priapulid worm and a nematomorph were used as outgroups [16] but excluded from our
analysis. Alignments were trimmed to reflect only the overlapping portion of the sequences from all species analyzed.
Second, this alignment, containing 1,841 base pairs/species
(including gaps) and an alternative alignment excluding any
region involving an insertion or deletion (1,423 base pairs/

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/8/R75

species remained), was used to estimate phylogenies from the
nucleotide sequences by parsimony and maximum likelihood
(with and without assumption of a molecular clock) using
Phylip [77]. Third, the trees with branch lengths derived from
molecular clock-based analysis were used to calculate phylogenetically independent contrasts for our parameters of interest [75]. The Phylip program 'contrasts' was used to compute
the phylogenetically independent contrasts using a Brownian-motion model [78,79] of genomic evolution.

Bioinformatics
The Emboss program 'cusp' was used to calculate codon usage
in the predicted translations [80]. The ENC [49] was calculated using the Emboss program 'Codon Heterozygosity
(Inverse of) in Protein-coding Sequences'. A genetic distance
statistic was used to quantify divergence of synonymous
codon usage between species [47] follows. Let tj be the
number of codons that code for the jth amino acid. We omit
analysis of the nondegenerate codons Met and Trp, as well as
the 'stop' codon, so that j = 1, 2 ... r, where r = 18. Furthermore, let aij and bij be the frequencies of the ith synonymous
codon in the jth AA of two organisms A and B, respectively.
Then, Nei's difference statistic D is defined as the following:
tj

2
J jaa = ∑ aij
i =1

J aa =

1
r

r

∑ J jaa
j =1

⎛
D = − log ⎜

J jbb = ∑ bij

J jab = ∑ aij bij

r

i =1

r

∑ J jbb
j =1

J ab =

1
r

r

∑ J jab
j =1

⎞
⎟.
⎠

Investigators have used D as an empirical measure of difference, averaged over all r residues, of the codon usage between
organisms [48]. There are a total of C32,2 = 496 meaningful
comparisons for the entire collection of 32 species. These
results are presented as an N × N square matrix and the values are presented as D × 100. For simplicity in the remainder
of the text we will refer to D × 100 as D100.
Phylogenetic changes in codon usage were analyzed using the
species tree derived from 18S rRNA sequences estimated by
maximum likelihood with a molecular clock imposed. Partitioning a matrix of distance values on a phylogenetic tree can
estimate amounts of change occurring on each branch, provided that the distance metrics obey the triangle inequality
(see the discussion on page 25 of the report by Page and Holmes [81]). Because of its logarithmic operation, Nei's difference statistic D violates the triangle inequality at high values.
For the phylogenetic analysis of codon usage, we substituted
for D a distance measure equal to 1 - antilog(-D), which obeys
the triangle inequality. Distances were partitioned on the tree
topology using the cyclic neighbor-joining algorithm illus-

To assess the differences in calculated codon usage distributions when using partial (EST-based) as compared with whole
genome data, we generated two datasets using C. elegans
ESTs and compared them with the curated gene set of C. elegans (Wormpep version 121). Each EST dataset was composed of 10,000 ESTs (approximately the average number of
ESTs used for the other 30 species); clustering and peptide
predictions were performed using the same algorithms as for
the other species.

Predicted expression level of a transcript (abundant, moderate, rare, and so on) was determined by counting the number
of ESTs comprising the cluster. Five species from different
clades that have been sampled with at least 10,000 ESTs from
several life-stage libraries were selected for these analyses.
Most of the cDNA libraries were constructed using the same
protocols [61,83], and although the libraries generally correlate with abundance in the original biologic sample, artifacts
can occur. The increase in use of a given codon for an AA in
highly expressed genes (optimal codons) was considered significant when the difference of the codon distributions within
that AA was statistically significant between datasets (P ≤
0.01).

comment

The ENC was used to measure the degree of codon bias for a
gene [49]. Because the ENC statistic is not reliable when analyzing very short sequences (20 AAs or less), 54 short translations out of a total of 70,358 were discarded from these
analyses. The relative abundance of nematode codons (per
species) having a statistically significant N1 context-dependent codon bias was calculated by computing the R values and
the standard deviations, as described by Fedorov and coworkers [57].
