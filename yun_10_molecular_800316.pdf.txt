Abstract
We sequenced the envelope (E) gene of 17 strains of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) isolated in South Korea in
1983-2005 and compared the sequences with those from previously reported strains. Our results show the remarkable
genetic stability of the E gene sequence in Korean JEV strains. Five pairs of E gene sequences from 10 Korean strains
were identical, despite geographical differences and a maximum five-year time span. Sequence comparisons with
other Asian strains revealed that the Korean strains are closely related to those from China, Japan, and Vietnam.
Genotype 3 strains were predominant in Korea before 1993, when genotype 1 strain K93A07 was first isolated. The two
genotypes were detected simultaneously in 1994 but since then, only genotype 1 has been isolated in South Korea.
Thus, the genotype change occurred according to the year of isolation rather than the geographical origin.
Findings
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus (genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae), which
causes acute viral encephalitis in humans. Approximately
30,000-50,000 cases, with 10,000 deaths, are reported
annually throughout Asia [1]. The JEV genome is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA molecule, approximately
11 kb in length. The polyprotein is processed into three
structural proteins, the capsid (C), membrane (M), and
envelope (E) proteins, and seven nonstructural proteins,
NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 [2].
Generally, RNA viruses have intrinsically high mutation
rates and consequently greater potential for rapid evolution than the DNA viruses [3]. Many studies have
revealed the phylogenetic relationships among the JEV
strains. Although full-genome sequences provide the
most reliable information, it takes several weeks to fully
sequence a strain and an enormous computing capacity is
required for the analysis of large sequences. Therefore,
much shorter sequences from various genes are typically
evaluated as phylogenetic markers. Historically, 3-4 JEV
genotypes have been proposed based on short sequences
(198 nt, 240 nt, or 280 nt) in the C/prM region [4-6], but

such short sequences are insufficient to identify exact
relationships. Therefore, the complete E gene (1,500 nt) is
preferred as a marker and 4-5 genotypes have been
reported in phylogenetic analyses [7-10]. To date, the
molecular epidemiology of JEV strains has been well
studied in Asian countries, including China, Japan, India,
Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam [6,11-14]. However, the
molecular characterization of the Korean strains, including their genetic diversity, has not been well documented.
Although over 100 JEV strains have been isolated during
extensive mosquito surveillance since 1975, most of them
have been lost, without further study. To date, only three
strains have been fully sequenced: K87P39, K94P05, and
KV1899 [15-17]. However, the C/prM or E genes of other
strains, such as K82P01, K91P55, and K93P05, have been
sequenced [18,19].
Previous studies have only dealt with a few Korean
strains isolated before 1999, and more recent strains must
be analyzed to fully characterize the molecular epidemiology of JEV in South Korea. In this study, we sequenced
the complete E genes of 17 Korean JEV strains isolated
between 1983 and 2005 and analyzed their genetic variation and their relationships to other Asian strains.
Since 1975, the Korea National Institute of Health has
annually checked JEV activity from vector mosquitoes
collected between July and September in nine provinces
of South Korea (Figure 1). Black-light traps were operated

once a week in cattle sheds and the mosquitoes were
identified morphologically and categorized to the species
level. Only Culex tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes (the
major JEV vector in Korea) were processed for virus isolation, using suckling mice as described previously [18].
Seventeen strains from among the JEV strains isolated in
South Korea in 1983-2005 were initially characterized in
the present study (Table 1). Viral RNA was extracted
from the stocks of each virus using the QIAamp Viral
RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The purified
RNA was used as the template for cDNA synthesis using
the SuperScript™ III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with primer JE-2623AS (NS1
region, 5'-GCTTTGTGGACGATCTTCGC-3'), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The synthesized
cDNA was then used for PCR amplification with
AccuPrime™ Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and primers JE-723 S (prM/M region, 5'-CGGACCAGGCATTCCAA-3') and JE-2623AS. The primers were designed
according to the consensus sequences of three Korean
JEV strains (K94P05, K87P39, and KV1899). The amplified products (1.9 kb) were purified and sequenced using

the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit
and an ABI 3730 × l sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) at Macrogen (Seoul, Korea). The
nucleotide sequences of the E genes (1,500 nt) were compared with those of other JEV strains representing each
genotype and different geographic regions. A total of 86 E
gene sequences were initially collected and 29 strains representing each country and genotype were finally selected
(Table 2). A multiple alignment was generated with the
ClustalX 2.0.11 program [20] and the percentage similarities between the aligned sequences were calculated using
the MegAlign program implemented in the Lasergene
software (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA). Phylogenetic
analyses based on the E gene were performed with the
neighbor-joining (NJ) and maximum likelihood (ML)
methods using MEGA 4.0 [21] and TREE-PUZZLE 5.2
[22], respectively. The E gene sequence of the Murray
Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV) was used as the outgroup (GenBank accession no. NC_000943). For the NJ
tree, the Tamura-Nei model was used to compute the
genetic distances, and the reliability of the tree was tested
by bootstrap analysis with 1,000 replications. For the ML

tree, the HKY85 evolutionary model of nucleotide substitution was used to build the tree based on the complete E
gene. The statistical significance of each internal branch
of the tree was indicated as a quartet puzzling (QP) value.
Other parameters for the ML tree are available upon
request. All the trees were produced with the MEGA 4.0
software.
Twenty-two Korean JEV strains showed minimal
sequence similarities (uncorrected p-distances) of 87.3%
and 96.2% at the nucleotide and amino acid sequence levels, respectively (Figure 2). Except for K82P01 and
K91P55 strains, Korean JEV strains were divided into two
groups, genotypes 1 and 3. The nucleotide sequence
divergence within the genotypes were only 0.3-1.7%
(mean 1.1%, genotype 1) and 0.1-2.7% (mean 1.5%, geno-

type 3), respectively. The sequence divergence between
the two genotypes was 11.5%-12.7% (mean 12.0%).
K82P01 showed nucleotide divergences of 9.5%-9.8%
from the genotype 1 strains and 3.8%-4.5% from the genotype 3 strains. K91P55 showed nucleotide divergences of
5.2%-5.9% from genotype 1 and 7.6-8.2% from genotype
3.
The E gene sequences of the Korean JEV strains showed
remarkable genetic stability. Five pairs of E gene
sequences from 10 Korean strains (K83P34 and K88A07,
K84A071 and K87A071, K93A07 and K96A07, K94A07
and K95A07, and K01JN and K01-JB) were identical,
despite differences in their geographic distributions and
the maximum five-year time span. This genetic stability
in JEV was also detected in strains from Taiwan, China,

and Japan [6,13,23]. When phylogenetic analyses were
performed, the branching patterns on both the NJ and
ML trees were similar, with slight differences in the reliability indices. Thus, only ML tree is presented in this
study (Figure 3). Most Korean strains were divided into
genotypes 1 and 3. Ten Korean strains grouped in genotype 3, together with those isolated in China, Japan, India,
Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam between the 1930 s
and the early 1990 s. Another 10 Korean strains clustered
in genotype 1, together with strains isolated in China,
Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam between the late 1970 s and
the present day. Historically, the genotypic classification
of some JEV strains was discordant, depending on the
phylogenetic markers or tree construction method used,
including substitution models.
Two Korean JEV strains, K82P01 and K91P55, were
notably problematic in phylogenetic analyses. K82P01
was grouped in genotype 3 or unclassified based on the E
gene sequence, and K91P55 was classified in either genotype 1 or genotype 3 depending on the gene region used
for the phylogenetic analysis [7,10,16]. Moreover, in an
analysis of Flavivirus recombination, K82P01 and
K91P55 appeared to be putative recombinant strains
derived from genotype 1 and 3 strains [24]. When we
analyzed the two strains using the RDP3 program [25],
both were shown to be recombinant strains (data not
shown). Chuang and Chen recently provided experimen-

tal evidence that RNA recombination occurs in JEV [26].
This genotypic conflict may be confirmed by sequencing
the E gene again or, more effectively, the full genome.
However, in this study, we could not pursue this
research because the two strains were lost during longterm storage. Therefore, we suggest that these two strains
are not used in future studies of JEV evolution. Our
results indicate that the genotypes of the Korean JEV
strains changed from genotype 3 to genotype 1 around
1993, with both genotypes isolated in 1994 (Figure 3).
Since then, only genotype 1 strains have been isolated in
South Korea. Before the present study, it was reported
that genotype 1 was introduced into Korea around 1991
(K91P55 strain) or 1994 (K94P05 strain) [14,15,27].
Interestingly, this genotype change was also reported in
Japan in 1991 [12,23], in China in 1979 [13], in Vietnam in
2001 [9], and in Thailand in 1991 [14]. Although several
explanations have been offered [5,7,9], we believe that
migrating water birds may be a major mediator of the
new genotypes in these regions. Consistent with this suggestion, the cattle egret, black-crowned night heron, and
little egret (the major JEV reservoir) are migratory species in at least the countries of Japan, Korea, and China
[28,29].
In summary, this study reports that at least two distinct
genotypes of JEV have circulated in South Korea. Genotype 3 strains were predominant in Korea before 1993,
when genotype 1 strain K93A07 was first isolated. The
two genotypes were detected simultaneously in 1994 but
since then, only genotype 1 has been isolated in South
Korea.
