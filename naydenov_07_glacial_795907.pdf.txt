Abstract
Background: At the last glacial maximum, Fennoscandia was covered by an ice sheet while the tundra occupied most of the
rest of northern Eurasia. More or less disjunct refugial populations of plants were dispersed in southern Europe, often trapped
between mountain ranges and seas. Genetic and paleobotanical evidences indicate that these populations have contributed much
to Holocene recolonization of more northern latitudes. Less supportive evidence has been found for the existence of glacial
populations located closer to the ice margin. Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is a nordic conifer with a wide natural range covering
much of Eurasia. Fractures in its extant genetic structure might be indicative of glacial vicariance and how different refugia
contributed to the current distribution at the continental level. The population structure of Scots pine was investigated on much
of its Eurasian natural range using maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms.
Results: A novel polymorphic region of the Scots pine mitochondrial genome has been identified, the intron 1 of nad7, with
three variants caused by insertions-deletions. From 986 trees distributed among 54 populations, four distinct multi-locus
mitochondrial haplotypes (mitotypes) were detected based on the three nad7 intron 1 haplotypes and two previously reported
size variants for nad1 intron B/C. Population differentiation was high (GST = 0.657) and the distribution of the mitotypes was
geographically highly structured, suggesting at least four genetically distinct ancestral lineages. A cosmopolitan lineage was widely
distributed in much of Europe throughout eastern Asia. A previously reported lineage limited to the Iberian Peninsula was
confirmed. A new geographically restricted lineage was found confined to Asia Minor. A new lineage was restricted to more
northern latitudes in northeastern Europe and the Baltic region.
Conclusion: The contribution of the various ancestral lineages to the current distribution of Scots pine was asymmetric and
extant endemism reflected the presence of large geographic barriers to migration. The results suggest a complex biogeographical
history with glacial refugia shared with temperate plant species in southern European Peninsulas and Asia Minor, and a genetically
distinct glacial population located more North. These results confirm recent observations for cold tolerant species about the
possible existence of refugial populations at mid-northern latitudes contributing significantly to the recolonization of northern
Europe. Thus, Eurasian populations of nordic plant species might not be as genetically homogenous as assumed by simply
considering them as offsets of glacial populations located in southern peninsulas. As such, they might have evolved distinctive
genetic adaptations during glacial vicariance, worth evaluating and considering for conservation.

Background
The cold periods of the Pleistocene have had a dramatic
impact on most organisms in temperate regions. Whereas
the Artic ice sheet began to grow about 2.5 Myr ago, more
severe climatic oscillations occurred mainly during the
last 700 000 year [1] with the consequence that the European biota has experienced repeatedly some drastic climate changes. Tree species responded through migration
to regions where environmental conditions allowed them
to survive [2,3]. Phylogeography investigates on the spatio-temporal dynamics of populations. It relies on inference from two main sources of information, i)
macrofossils and pollen in sediment profiles, ii) population structure in DNA markers ideally inferred at the
sequence level. Cytoplasmic markers, which are uniparently inherited in most plant species, are especially well
suited for phylogeographic studies. They helped infer the
number of genetically distinct ancestral lineages, their
location during the last glacial maximum, and the postglacial migration routes for several tree and plant species
in Europe [e.g. [4-11]]. These studies and others based on
fossil evidence suggested that most plant and tree refuges
were located in southern European peninsulas and the
Balkans [12-15]. Glacial refugia and recolonization routes
were found to coincide often for a number of plant and
animal species [[3,16] and [17]]. In North America, common patterns are also starting to emerge and much knowledge has been rapidly gained from the analysis of species
with wide distributions [e.g. [18-20]]. However, there is
now increasing evidence that some European species were
established much further north and east than previously
assumed during glacial time [21-25]. Similar inferences
have also been made in North America, where genetic and
palynological evidence is accumulating for the presence of
glacial populations much closer to the ice fronts as once
thought [e.g. [26-29]]. Phylogeographic studies in Europe
also indicate asymmetric contributions of glacial refugia
to Holocene colonization: some ancestral lineages
remained endemic, because of geographic barriers limiting migration, while others contributed considerably to
the postglacial colonization of more northern latitudes
[[3,6,8] and [30]].
Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L., subgenus Diploxylon) is a
long-lived evergreen monoecious forest tree species growing in a large variety of ecological conditions from western
Europe to Asia. Of all pine species, it has the largest distribution [31,32]. Its natural range extends northwards from
Spain to northern Fennoscandia, and westwards from
longitudes 5°W in Spain and Scotland to 135°E in Siberia. While most of its natural range is contiguous, there are
also large populations of Scots pine disconnected from
the main natural range such as in Scotland, Spain, France,
Turkey, and former Yugoslavia. Extensive variations in
phenotypic traits as well as geographic races and types

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/233

have been reported [33-37]. Much of this variation has
been usually attributed to adaptation to edaphic and climatic factors [35,38]. Studies carried out over the last 30
years using isozymes, terpenes and flavonoid markers
have also revealed the existence of distinct evolutionary
units in Scots pine, which might be indicative of isolation
in different glacial refugia. Although these studies were
not entirely congruent and not aimed at deciphering
effects related to glacial and postglacial history, they
helped define biogeographical hypotheses for the western
and northwestern European range of Scots pine [39-45].
Because of the regional scope of many of these studies and
the different phenotypic or genetic attributes used, much
biogeographical knowledge on the glacial and postglacial
history of Eurasia remains to be gained from analysing the
broad geographic distribution of Scots pine and by using
homologous gene markers with stronger historical
imprints.
In the Pinaceae, mtDNA is maternally inherited and dispersed through seeds only [46,47]. This mode of dispersion helps avoid the problems with inferring history from
present-day distributions of nuclear or cpDNA markers
because the latter are dispersed by both seeds and pollen
in the Pinaceae, which produce a more rapid breakdown
of the historical genetic signatures induced by glacial
vicariance. However, one of the major difficulties one
faces with plant mtDNA is the low level of variation in
their exons and introns [48,49], which limits the detection of variation between and within species at the
sequence level [e.g. [47,50]]. An indel has been discovered
in the intron B/C of the mitochondrial gene nad1 in Scots
pine, which allowed identifying a genetically distinct
ancestral lineage in the Iberian Peninsula [6]. Restriction
fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) of a region
encompassing the mitochondrial gene cox1 have also
been found in populations of Scots pine from western
Europe [5,51], which helped identifying two genetically
distinct groups of populations each distributed on a large
latitudinal range. The possibility for a refuge at northern
latitudes was suggested in a previous study [5]. Given the
little diversity observed in the mtDNA regions surveyed
and the population sampling limited mostly to western
Europe, it is likely that the pan-Eurasian Scots pine possesses more genetically distinct ancestral lineages. Such
evidence would contribute towards a more complete
understanding of the historical factors and processes leading to the current distribution of species genetic diversity
throughout Eurasia.
In an effort to discern from a phylogeographic perspective
the possible existence and contribution of mid-northern
refugia to the glacial and postglacial history of Eurasian
biota, we investigated the extant genetic structure of Scots
pine with a set of populations covering much of the natu-

ral range in Europe and also in Asia. We also report on a
novel polymorphic mtDNA region in Scots pine, the
intron 1 of the gene nad7, which is indicative of unknown
genetically distinct maternal lineages. The location of one
of these lineages in northern Europe supports the view
that Quaternary refugia located outside European peninsulas at mid-northern latitudes might have played a significant role in the Holocene recolonization of Europe [22].

Results
mtDNA polymorphisms and population differentiation
Out of 15 mtDNA regions surveyed (Table 1), intraspecific polymorphism was detected for only two loci in Scots
pine. Polymorphism was detected de novo for the intron 1
of nad7 with three length variants. They were 1175, 1170
and 1143 bp long and are hereafter called haplotypes A,
B, and C, respectively. The size differences were caused by
two single indels: one of 32 bp exclusive to haplotype C
and one of 5 bp exclusive to haplotype B (Table 2). As previously reported from a more limited sampling [6], two
size variants were detected for the intron B/C of nad1
among the 986 samples analysed herein. These fragments
differed by a 31 bp indel and are hereafter called haplotypes A (217 bp) and B (248 bp). A third variant restricted
to Italy was recently reported for this gene [30]. It was not
detected in our sampled trees which were all from outside
the Italian Peninsula. Primers for these two mtDNA
regions were also tested on 100 to 500 individuals for
each of five other pines of the subgenus Diploxylon (P. resinosa, P. mugo, P nigra, P. heldreichii, and P. contorta) and
positive amplifications were obtained (data not shown).

The first four species belong to the section Pinus, but the
first three are members of subsection Pinus (as for Scots
pine) and Pinus heldreichii is member of subsection Pinaster. As for P. contorta, it belongs to section Trifoliae, subsection Contortae. Fragment length polymorphism was
detected for both nad1 intron B/C and nad7 intron 1 in P.
heldreichii. For P. nigra, only nad1 intron B/C showed polymorphism. No polymorphism was detected in P. mugo
and P. resinosa. For P. contorta, polymorphism was only
observed for nad7 intron 1 involving the same minisatellite-like marker as previously reported for this species and
the closely related P. banksiana [20].
For Scots pine, the nomenclature used for mitochondrial
multi-locus haplotypes (mitotypes) followed a two-letter
code after the haplotypes observed for nad7 intron 1 (A, B,
C) and nad1 intron B/C (A, B), respectively (Table 2).
Among the four observed mitotypes, the most abundant
one was AA (72.3 %), followed by BA (17.3 %), CA (5.8
%), and AB (4.6 %) (Table 3). The minimum spanning
tree indicates that the mitotypes were more or less
arranged as a star phylogeny with little sequence variation
among them and no recombination (Figure 1B). The
observed number of mitotypes per population (nh) was 1
or 2 without exception, with an average of 1.50 (Table 3).
The mitotype diversity index per population (H) was low
to moderate (average of 0.141) and ranged from 0 to
0.500 (Table 3). Population differentiation was high
among the 54 populations, with GST and NST values of
0.657 and 0.685, respectively (Table 4). When excluding
the six more diverse populations from a presumed zone of

contact in central and northeastern Europe between two
distinct mtDNA lineages (see below), the GST and NST values increased to 0.746 and 0.767, respectively, among the
remaining populations. However, the presence of a formal phylogeographic structure was not supported, as NST
was not significantly higher than GST. Lack of test power is
likely the reason, given the small genetic divergence
observed among the four mtDNA variants detected.
Geographic structure
The geographic distribution of mitotypes appeared to be
essentially non-random, with clusters of mitotypes geographically quite well delineated (Figure 1A, see also
SAMOVA test below). The Mediterranean region showed
the highest diversity with three of the four mitotypes
revealed in the study. The cosmopolitan haplotype AA
was largely distributed and found in most of the populations sampled. Geographic structuring was evident for
other mitotypes. Mitotype CA was present only in Asia
Minor, in the Pontide Mountains of Turkey (populations
#14 to #16). Mitotype AB was found fixed in some high
mountain populations of the Iberian Peninsula (Iberian
cordillera – Zaragoza/Valencia provinces) (#52 and #54)
and was observed as a rare variant in some populations of
the Balkans (#3, #5, #6, #8 and #10). The distribution of
mitotype BA was quite unexpected: it was largely distributed in the lowland region of middle to northern latitudes
in eastern Europe. It was prevalent in the Baltic region and
quite frequent in Russia, west of the Ural Mountains. But
it was also detected in Siberia (population #44). A large
zone composed of populations with variable mixed
genetic background (mitotypes AA and BA) was observed
in central and northeastern Europe. It includes most if not
all populations bearing mitotype BA. The zone extends
from the southeast of Russia to the Baltic States (see populations #32, #33, #35, #38, #40, #41, and #43). The
within-population mitotype diversity of these populations (H = 0.463) was much higher than elsewhere.

SAMOVA was conducted repeatedly by increasing the
value of the number of population groups (K) until the

FCT value reached a maximum of 0.785, which was
obtained for K = 4 (Table 4). For K = 3, a maximum FCT
value of 0.720 was obtained. The four groups confirmed
trends from visual inspection and corresponded to: (I) the
majority of populations from Europe and Asia, (II) northeastern Europe, (III) Asia Minor and (IV) the high mountains of the Iberian Peninsula. Group I was the most
widespread geographically, including 44 populations
(Table 4). It contained mostly the cosmopolitan mitotype
AA and, at a lower frequency, mitotype BA and AB. Differentiation among the populations of the group was moderate. Population differentiation within each of the three
other groups (II, III, and IV) was smaller. Group II from
northeastern Europe was largely dominated by mitotype
BA. The two remaining groups III and IV were highly
homogenous. Group III regrouped populations from Turkey fixed or nearly fixed for mitotype CA, and group IV
regrouped populations from the Iberian Peninsula fixed
for mitotype AB.

Discussion
mtDNA diversity and population differentiation
DNA sequence variation is low in the mtDNA of conifers
[e.g. [47,50]]. Accordingly, little intraspecific variation has
been found in the mtDNA of P. sylvestris in western
Europe, including four RFLP variants for the cox1 region
[5] and three size variants at the locus nad1 intron B/C, of
which two were found endemic to the Iberian and Italian
Peninsulas [6,30]. The three new size variants reported
herein for the locus nad7 intron 1 indicate new regionspecific variants for northeastern Europe and Asia Minor.
No other length polymorphisms or substitutions were
detected in Scots pine in spite of the screening of 15 distinct mtDNA regions. Highly informative minisatellitelike motifs such as those rarely detected in some spruce
[52,53] and pine taxa [20] could not be detected in Scots
pine.

The overall level of population differentiation estimated
in this study from mitotype variation at the nad1 intron B/
C and nad7 intron 1 loci was rather high and similar to

that reported in earlier studies restricted to Scots pine populations from western Europe based on RFLPs of the cox1
region (GST = 0.83; [5]) or indels of the nad1 intron B/C
(GST = 0.60; [6]). Such estimates are in line with averages
reported for maternally inherited markers for a number of
conifer and angiosperm taxa [54]. The amount of population differentiation determined by nuclear markers such
as isozymes was generally much smaller in Scots pine with
GST values ranging between 0.025 and 0.076 [43,55-61]].
However, these studies were carried out mostly at the
regional level. Among-population differentiation was also
much higher for mtDNA markers than for paternally
inherited cpDNA markers in a Scots pine study covering
much of the species range (GST = 0.11; [62]), as usually
observed in other conifers [e.g. [54,63]].
Geographic structure
The present study confirms the existence of a genetically
distinct set of populations in the high mountains of the
Iberian Peninsula [5,6] while variants discovered in the
intron 1 of nad7 signal distinctive evolution in Asia Minor
and northeastern Europe. Haplotype B at locus nad1
intron B/C was observed mostly in the Iberian Peninsula
in some high elevation populations of the Zaragoza/
Valencia regions where it was fixed or nearly fixed. It was
observed only sparingly west of Catalonia. Such a distribution indicates that these Catalan populations have been
isolated during glaciations and have not contributed to
the recolonization of Europe [[5,6] and [30]]. A distinct
dynamics of Catalan populations from the rest of the Iberian Peninsula has also been reported for other species
like Aleppo pine [64], Maritime pine [9,65], and white
oaks [8]. In the present study, haplotype B of nad1 intron
B/C has also been discovered, albeit at low frequency, in
five other populations located in Bulgaria, in the Balkan
Peninsula, thus far away from the center of prevalence for
this haplotype in the Iberian Peninsula. Long-distance
seed dispersal could be invoked but is unlikely over such
long distances, given the heterogenous topography and
relative isolation of Iberia. The probability of such longdistance movements would be higher in the northern and
more eastern parts of Scots pine natural range, given the
lack of major physical barriers. Another perhaps more
plausible explanation for the rare presence of haplotype B
of nad1 intron B/C in some Balkan populations could be
that it is ancient and was present in more than one southern ice refugia. Its high or low frequency, depending on
the region considered, could be attributable to stochastic
variation, especially if southern refugia populations suffered from severe bottlenecks. The weak occurrence of this
haplotype in the Balkans might also result from human
activity, as previously suggested for the rare presence of
this variant in Poland [6]. Whereas the hypothesis of seed
source transfer cannot be totally ruled out, it is difficult to
sustain because of (i) the lack of hard evidence for such

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/233

seed source transfer between the Balkans and the Iberian
Peninsula in the past; (ii) natural stands in which seeds
were collected existed long before forest management
activities began in Europe; and (iii) the relative conservatism of forest seed transfer guidelines in the Balkan region
[66]. A third explanation could relate to ancient mtDNA
capture from hybridizing species in the region [67,68].
Accordingly, phylogeographical studies of other pine species in the region using the same gene locus might help
clarify the issue.
The detection and high prevalence of haplotype C of nad7
intron 1 in Asia Minor populations only is a strong signal
for the presence of a genetically distinct glacial population. This relictual population would have experienced
severe bottlenecks, because populations were all fixed for
this haplotype except for one tree harbouring the cosmopolitan haplotype A. After glaciation, it would have
remained isolated, eastward by the Caucasus Mountains,
northward by the Black Sea, and westward by the Bosphorus passage. The cold and arid climate in this region during the Holocene might have also impeded the expansion
of this population [69], but not its survival as Scots pine
can survive under very harsh conditions [70].
The high prevalence of haplotype B of nad7 intron 1 in
northeastern Europe suggests the presence of a genetically
distinct glacial population at more northern latitudes
than previously thought, an idea that had already been
suggested for Scots pine [5]. A recent mutation during the
Holocene giving rise to haplotype B of nad7 intron 1 is
unlikely, given the widespread distribution of this haplotype. As well, homoplasy is unlikely, given the low rate of
variation of angiosperm and conifer mitochondrial
introns [47,49]. A large number of populations had mixed
composition of both haplotypes A and B of nad7 intron 1
in central and northeastern Europe. Their diversity index
was highest among all populations surveyed, which could
result for the meeting of two genetically distinct glacial
lineages (A and B), or indicates that the glacial population
harboring haplotype B had mixed genetic composition.
The uneven distribution of haplotype B of nad7 intron 1
among these populations, with a higher prevalence of
haplotype B as one moves northward, could result from
successive founder events during colonization [71], as
recently proposed for European hedgehogs [72]. This is
likely, given than that migration from more southern latitudes was necessary to colonize these previously glaciated
areas.
Implications for glacial and postglacial history of
European vegetation
There is some evidence from fossil and palynological data
that cold adapted tree species occupied mid-altitude sites
in the mountains of southern Europe during the last gla-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:233

cial stage [13]. Moreover, the southern peninsulas of Iberia, Italy, the Balkans, and Greece, which are separated
from the rest of Europe by major mountain ranges such as
the Pyrenees, Alps and Caucasus, were identified as major
glacial refugia for many species [[14,30] and [65]]. Our
genetic data indicates that a genetically distinct glacial refuge existed in Asia Minor as well. Tree pollen, including
that of the genus Pinus, was recorded in the Balkans about
14 000 years BP [13] while it was barely present as late as
10 500 years BP in southwestern Turkey where the climate
was cold and dry with steppe vegetation [69]. Pine pollen
attained its maximum only in early Holocene in western
Anatolia and in mid-Holocene in more eastern areas,
likely because of similar climatic limitations [73,74].
Thus, it is apparent that tree populations would have been
scarce in the region at LGM, 21 Kyr ago. The refuge is also
unlikely to have contributed much to the postglacial colonization of Europe, given the genetic discontinuity
detected in Scots pine. The peculiar location of Turkey
between the Black and Mediterranean seas would have
promoted isolation from more northern areas. It is likely
that other elements of the steppe vegetation in the region
also represent relicts from the pre-Holocene era and suffered similar effects during glacial periods, as shown
recently for field mouse [75]. As such, it is expected that
they would show a distinct genetic background, as that
detected in Scots pine.
The exact location and size of the Scots pine glacial population giving rise to the large spread of haplotype B of
nad7 intron 1 in eastern or northeastern Europe remain
unknown. Based on fossil data, Scots pine glacial populations existed in the Balkans and possibly even in central
Europe [Litynska-Zajac M. cited by Stewart and Lister
[22,23]]. The large spread of haplotype A of nad7 intron 1
throughout Europe is likely the consequence of an expansion from glacial populations from that region [30]. Such
spread northwestwards towards Germany and France and
northeastwards throughout Eastern Europe and Siberia
correlates geographic dispersion patterns and colonization routes inferred for a grasshopper [76], for European
beech [77], for the oaks [4], and for Norway spruce
[52,78]. However, some of these colonization routes are
still open to alternative interpretation. Furthermore, such
observations do not correlate well with the exceptionally
northern location of haplotype B of nad7 intron 1.
The peculiar northern distribution of haplotype B of nad7
intron 1 indicates that Scots pine has likely survived in a
refuge distinct from those usually recognized in the southern peninsulas of Europe, perhaps under the form of scattered glacial populations spread over sizeable latitudinal
areas reaching European mid-latitudes not far from the ice
front. Scots pine is known to survive and grow reasonably
well upon permafrost [72]. Evidence is also accumulating

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/233

regarding the existence of glacial populations located at
more northern latitudes [e.g. [25,28] and [29]] and their
significant contribution to Holocene colonization
[22,25]. In addition, if the mixed zone observed in northcentral and northeastern Europe between the cosmopolitan AA mitotype and the northern BA mitotype represents
truly a zone of secondary contact, the northern location
and shape of this zone would not correspond well to the
meeting of two ancestral lineages both located in or near
southern European peninsulas. While the existence of
such zones with typically higher genetic diversity has been
reported for other tree species in Europe [[3,4] and [16]]
as well as in North America [19,20] where ancestral lineages from southern latitudes would converge at more
northern latitudes, this possible zone of contact would
more likely correspond to the junction between a lineage
moving northwards from the Balkans or from even more
east (the AA lineage), and a lineage of more northern or
northeastern origin (the BA lineage). In one rare occurrence of similar observation, Taberlet et al [3] recognized
a contact zone of migration fronts as far north as in Scandinavia for Picea abies. They proposed that the area was
presumably colonized from the south and from the northeast by populations originating from different refugia.
While the current areas of maximum abundance of haplotype B of nad7 intron1, Finland and northwestern Russia,
were completely glaciated at LGM [79], it is likely that
trees colonizing the region would have migrated northward from a region anywhere west of the Ural Mountains.
There are indications from general circulation models that
the climate during the last glacial maximum was warm
enough to allow Scots pine to survive well as far north as
above 50°N in isolated regions of northern Ukraine and
southwestern Russia, for instance [30]. A location more
south is also possible if founder events after long-distance
dispersal are hypothetized, followed by drift and lineage
sorting to account for the high abundance of haplotype B
of nad7 intron 1 as one moves into Finland and northwestern Russia. However, this hypothesis becomes
unlikely for long-distance dispersal from refuges located
in the southern European peninsulas, given the absence of
haplotype B of nad7 intron 1 in southern populations of
Scots pine.
More mtDNA polymorphisms will need to be discovered
in order to distinguish Scots pine disjunct populations
from eastern Europe and Asia and investigate if significant
glacial vicariance factors existed in this vast region. Siberian populations where the cosmopolitan mitotype AA
was dominant might have been established from a glacial
population located in southwestern Siberia, in the upper
Irtysh River Valley [80-82], or from a more southern location. As for Scots pine populations located in the far-east
in China where the cosmopolitan mitotype AA was found

Page 8 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:233

fixed, it is not clear if it is derived from a more western refuge located in southwestern Siberia (see above) or if a refuge existed in northeastern China. Palynological evidence
suggests that pine was present at several locations in the
region during the last glaciation, but it is unclear if the fossil pollen was representative of Scots pine as many pine
species are endemic to the region [82].

Conclusion
The present study suggests a more complex biogeographical history than previously thought for Scots pine and presumably, for its associated plant congeners. The study is
congruent with others [[3,15,17] and [21]] about the
asymetry of glacial refugia in contributing to the postglacial recolonization of Eurasia. This trend is best exemplified by the prevalent nad7 intron 1 haplotype found
specific to the relictual population from Turkey and from
nowhere else in Eurasia. It indicates that Asia Minor is
likely to represent a prime area of endemism supporting
genetically distinct lineages unlikely to be found in the
rest of Eurasia. Such a trend highlights the geography of
the region as an important vicariance factor limiting
migration and gene flow. Similarly as for other areas of
endemism in Europe (e.g. Iberian and Italian Peninsulas),
seed source movements from the rest of Eurasia to Asia
Minor should be restricted. Reserves could be considered
to ensure in situ preservation of relictual genetic diversity
and structure, which need to be further documented at the
level of the chloroplast and nuclear genomes as well as for
other plant and animal species.
The discovery of a genetically distinct North-European lineage suggests that some glacial populations may have survived isolated from refugia in South European peninsulas
at more mid- northern latitudes. Given the colonization
time lag for southern populations to reach northern latitudes due to distance, topographic barriers [2,83] and
competition from a possible network of resident populations sparingly distributed, such genetically distinct glacial populations have apparently played a major role in
the postglacial colonization of parts of northern Europe.
A likely consequence of such glacial vicariance is that
extant northern populations of nordic plant species might
not be as homogenous as assumed by simply considering
them as offsets of glacial populations located at southern
latitudes. This observation implies that they might have
evolved distinctive genetic adaptations during glacial
vicariance, worth evaluating and considering in conservation programs [84,85]. As well, the extensive mixing of
two ancestral lineages in central and northeastern Europe
provides the opportunity to perhaps identify and preserve
unique adaptive diversity.

Methods
Population sampling and DNA isolation
Fifty-four natural populations were sampled and their
location was chosen in order to represent most of the natural range of the species in Europe and Asia. Twenty populations were from the eastern part of the Ural Mountains
and Asia (Russia and China) as well as from Asia Minor
(Turkey), and the remaining 34 populations from 13
European countries (Figure 1 and Table 3). Each seed lot
represented a bulk of seeds from a minimum of 50 individuals with a minimum distance of 100 m between
them. Seed samples were collected from each population
and stored in darkness at 4°C until they were processed.

Seeds from each population were soaked on moistened
filter paper in Petri dishes at 26°C under a photoperiod of
14 hours for 2 days until DNA extraction. DNA was
extracted from the haploid megagametophyte for each of
9 to 20 seeds per population using a genomic DNA mini
preparation kit (Sigma-Aldrich), for a total of 986 DNA
samples and an average of 18.3 samples per population
(Table 3). A screening for mtDNA polymorphism was
conducted by assembling an exploratory panel of 26 out
of the 986 DNA samples, each representative of a different
population and ensuring that geographically widespread
populations were represented.
Screening for mtDNA polymorphism and sequencing
A total of 15 mtDNA regions were screened for polymorphisms using various techniques (Table 1). Polymorphism was detected for only two regions, nad1 intron B/C
(2 haplotypes), and nad7 intron 1 (3 haplotypes). DNA
samples bearing different haplotypes for each of the variable mitochondrial regions were selected (3 DNA samples
per locus and per haplotype from different populations)
and sequenced in order to determine the exact nature of
every fragment length polymorphism and to detect the
presence of potential fragment length homoplasies. Direct
sequencing of the two DNA strands was carried out on an
automated 3730XL DNA analyser (Applied Biosystems)
with the dideoxynucleotide chain termination procedure
using the appropriate amplification primers and Big Dye
Terminator kit-V.3.1 (Applied Biosystems). The complete
sequences for nad7 intron 1 haplotypes have been deposited in GenBank (GenBank: DQ665913 to DQ665915).
The complete sequence for nad1 intron B/C was already
available in GenBank [6]. Multi-locus mtDNA haplotypes
(mitotypes) were then defined by considering single-locus
mtDNA genotypes simultaneously and their relationships
were determined by statistical parsimony analysis of the
aligned sequences using the program TCS [86].
mtDNA population survey and numerical analyses
Single-locus haplotypes were determined for each of 986
individuals with the internal primers pair nad1H and

Page 9 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:233

nad1I for nad1 intron B/C, as described by Soranzo et al
[6], and the primers nad7 intron1 forward and nad7
intron1 reverse for nad7 intron 1, as described by Jaramillo-Correa et al [19]. Primers were synthetized by Invitrogen. DNA was amplified in a PTC225 thermal cycler (MJ
Research) using Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) in a 12 µl reaction volume, following protocols published by Soranzo et al [6] for nad1 intron B/C and
Jaramillo-Correa et al [19] for nad7 intron 1. PCR products
of nad7 intron 1 were digested with the restriction enzyme
Sau3A I (Promega) and then separated through 8 % non
denaturating polyacrylamide gels (in TBE) in order to
detect putative cleaved amplified polymorphic sites
(CAPS). PCR products of nad1 intron B/C were electrophoresed through 2 % agarose gel.
The number of observed mitotypes per population (nh)
and the total mtDNA diversity per population (H; equivalent to the expected heterozygosity, HE, for diploid data;
[87]) were estimated. Population differentiation was estimated using two fixation indices, GST and NST, using PERMUT [88]. The first statistics is calculated based solely on
mitotype frequencies, whereas the second one takes into
account the genetic relatedness among mitotypes. Thus, if
the estimated NST value is higher than the GST value, it
indicates that closely related mitotypes tend to cluster in
the same area, supporting the presence of a formal phylogeographic structure.
Geographic population structure was assessed using a spatial analysis of molecular variance SAMOVA 1.0 [89,90].
A matrix of pairwise distances between populations was
first constructed using mitotype frequencies, as well as a
matrix of pairwise geographic distances between populations. The method implemented in SAMOVA employs a
simulated annealing procedure and uses allele frequency
data along with geographic coordinates of the sampled
populations to identify population groups maximizing
genetic differentiation. We determined the most likely
number of K groups by repeatedly running SAMOVA with
variable numbers of groups and by choosing the number
resulting in a maximum FCT value [90]. The configuration
with the largest FCT value among the 100 tested was
retained as the best grouping of populations.
