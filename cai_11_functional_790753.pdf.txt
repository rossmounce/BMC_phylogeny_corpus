Functional investigation of grass carp reovirus
nonstructural protein NS80
Lin Cai, Xiaoyun Sun, Ling Shao and Qin Fang*

Abstract
Background: Grass Carp Reovirus (GCRV), a highly virulent agent of aquatic animals, has an eleven segmented
dsRNA genome encased in a multilayered capsid shell, which encodes twelve proteins including seven structural
proteins (VP1-VP7), and five nonstructural proteins (NS80, NS38, NS31, NS26, and NS16). It has been suggested that
the protein NS80 plays an important role in the viral replication cycle that is similar to that of its homologous
protein μNS in the genus of Orthoreovirus.
Results: As a step to understanding the basis of the part played by NS80 in GCRV replication and particle
assembly, we used the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system to identify NS80 interactions with proteins NS38, VP4, and
VP6 as well as NS80 and NS38 self-interactions, while no interactions appeared in the four protein pairs NS38-VP4,
NS38-VP6, VP4-VP4, and VP4-VP6. Bioinformatic analyses of NS80 with its corresponding proteins were performed
with all currently available homologous protein sequences in ARVs (avian reoviruses) and MRVs (mammalian
reoviruses) to predict further potential functional domains of NS80 that are related to VFLS (viral factory-like
structures) formation and other roles in viral replication. Two conserved regions spanning from aa (amino acid)
residues of 388 to 433, and 562 to 580 were discovered in this study. The second conserved region with
corresponding conserved residues Tyr565, His569, Cys571, Asn573, and Glu576 located between the two coiledcoils regions (aa ~513-550 and aa ~615-690) in carboxyl-proximal terminus were supposed to be essential to form
VFLS, so that aa residues ranging from 513 to 742 of NS80 was inferred to be the smallest region that is necessary
for forming VFLS. The function of the first conserved region including Ala395, Gly419, Asp421, Pro422, Leu438, and
Leu443 residues is unclear, but one-third of the amino-terminal region might be species specific, dominating
interactions with other viral components.
Conclusions: Our results in this study together with those from previous investigations indicate the protein NS80
might play a central role in VFLS formation and viral components recruitment in GCRV particle assembly, similar to
the μNS protein in ARVs and MRVs.

Background
Grass carp reovirus (GCRV) is a tentative member in
the Aquareovirus genus of the Reoviridae family which
shares a common genome of 9 to 12 double-stranded
RNA (dsRNA) segments packaged within a multilayered
icosahedral capsid shell [1]. Different from most identified aquareoviruses, GCRV has been recognized as one
of the most pathogenic agents amongst Aquareovirus
isolates, which has caused a severe epidemic outbreak of
hemorrhagic disease affecting a vast majority (~85%) of
fingerling and yearling grass carp in southern China

[2,3]. GCRV serves as a good model for studying viral
replication and pathogenesis of Aquareovirus due to its
high virulence.
Studies revealed that there is a close evolutionary relationship between MRVs (mammalian reoviruses) and
Aquareovirus [4]. Recent progress on 3D structural
reconstruction of single particles of GCRV by cryo-electron microscopy (CryoEM) confirmed the high similarities in the structures of viral proteins between GCRV
and MRVs [5-8]. Previous investigations indicate that
GCRV eleven genomic dsRNA segments (named S1S11) encoded seven structural proteins (VP1-VP7) and
five nonstructural proteins (NS80, NS38, NS31, NS26,
and NS16) [4]. Comparative studies revealed that

mature GCRV particles consists of five core proteins
VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4, and VP6 which are respectively
homologous to l2, l3, l1, μ2, and s2 in MRVs; and
two outer capsid proteins VP5 and VP7 which are analogues of μ1 and s3 in MRVs [4-7]. However, there is
no special cell attachment protein in GCRV that is
homologous to MRVs s1, hinting at different viral
attachment mechanisms in GCRV and MRVs.
While the structural proteins are of great importance
for GCRV entry into cells during its infection, nonstructural proteins are believed to be indispensable in replication and nascent virus particle assembly. Recent
progress on nonstructural proteins in genus Orthoreovirus including MRVs and ARVs (avian reoviruses) suggests that μNS serves as a versatile protein which could
form viral factory-like structures (VFLS) and recruit proteins sNS, l1, l2, l3, μ2, s2, and core particles to VFLS
[9-21]. As such, NS80 might act as a scaffolding protein
and a leading performer associated with the highly efficient viral replication and/or accurate assembly of progeny core particles during GCRV infection. Apart from
the central role played by μNS in VFLS formation, nonstructural protein sNS, core protein μ2 and s2 as well
as RNA transcription related proteins l1, l2, and l3 are
also crucial accessories in VFLS formation in associating
with μNS[17,20]. sNS is known to interact directly with
μNS and act as a plus single-stranded RNA (ssRNA)
binding protein involved in recruiting mRNAs to VFLS
for reovirus genomic dsRNA synthesis and assembly
[10,21-23]. The core protein μ2 is known to be a cellular
microtubule associated protein that is linked to the
VFLS morphology formation (showed either globular or
filamentous). It displays both ssRNA and dsRNA binding abilities that might function in reovirus transcription
[11,24-30] and also exhibits both nucleoside and RNA
triphosphatase activities[28,29]. Moreover, another core
protein s2 that is known to play a role in stabilizing the
core shell and outer capsid, has also been detected to
interact with μNS and performs dsRNA-binding ability
but shows no enzymatic activity [21,31,32].
Much progress has been made in identifying the multiple roles played by μNS in viral replication and assembly in MRVs/ARVs, but little is known about the
properties of NS80 protein in Aquareovirus. Previously,
we characterized that the full-length and carboxyl-proximal region (aa 335-742) of NS80 are able to form VFLS
in both infected and transfected cells[33]. To extend our
understanding of this multifunctional protein, we investigated interactions of NS80 with itself and with the proteins NS38, VP4 and VP6 using the yeast two-hybrid
system. Bioinformatic analysis was also conducted to
identfy and define the potential functional domains of
NS80 that are related to VFLS formation and other
roles in GCRV replication and assembly. Our results

provide valuable information for further detailed experimental design of NS80 to determine the functional
domains and explore currently unknown functions.

Methods
Virus and cell lines

GCRV strain named GCRV873, maintained in this
laboratory was used in this study. CIK (Ctenopharyngodon idellus kidney) cells were employed for GCRV propagation. The GCRV particles were purified from the
infected CIK cells and used for genomic RNA extraction. The first strand cDNA was synthesized using
GCRV total genomic RNA as a template that is
described elsewhere [3].
Construction of recombinant plasmids

The prepared total cDNA of GCRV873 was used as the
PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) template. A total of
four pairs of primers (listed in Table 1) were designed
and used in the PCR amplification of GCRV873 target
genes encoding proteins of NS80 (Y2H-NS80-F and
Y2H-NS80-R), NS38 (Y2H-NS38-F and Y2H-NS38-R),
VP4 (Y2H-VP4-F and Y2H-VP4-R), and VP6 (Y2HVP6-F and Y2H-VP6-R). The PCR amplification was
performed using an Eppendorf Mastercycler personal
(Hamburg, Germany) in a 50 μL volume containing
~10 ng cDNA, 1 ng μL -1 of each primer, 200 μM of
each dNTP, 10 μL of 5 × PrimeSTAR™ Buffer and 1.25
units of PrimeSTAR™ HS DNA Polymerase (TaKaRa,
Dalian, China), and ddH2O up to 50 μL. The PCR program consisted of an initial 2 min denaturation step at
98°C; 30 cycles of 10 sec at 98°C, 2 min at 68°C; and a

final extension step at 68°C for 5 min. The positive gene
fragments were purified by AxyPrep™ DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Axygen, Hangzhou, China). Clontech Y2H bait
plasmid pGBKT7, prey plasmid pGADT7, gel purified
gene fragments encoding NS80 and NS38 were double
digested at 37°C for 3 hours in a 50 μL volume containing 5 μL of 10 × buffer, 1 μL of EcoRI (TaKaRa, Dalian,
China), 1 μL of BamHI (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), 2-5 μg
of the vector or gene fragment, amending ddH2O to 50
μL. The pGBKT7 and pGADT7 vectors, gel purified
gene fragments encoding VP4 and VP6 were double
digested with NdeI (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) and SmaI
(TaKaRa, Dalian, China) using the same volume and
condition as the above. The digested products were
heated at 70°C for 10 min and then purified using AxyPrep™ PCR Cleanup Kit (Axygen, Hangzhou, China).
Here, it is important to note that EcoRI and NdeI sites
have the same fusion frame in both the pGBKT7 and
pGADT7 vectors. After estimating the concentrations by
running an agarose gel of the digested and purified vectors and inserted fragments of interest, ligations were
performed and incubated at 4°C overnight and transformed into E.coli DH5a competent cells by the chemical transformation method according to standard
protocol. The transformants were screened by using regular enzyme digestion and PCR methods, and the resulting candidate positive clones were confirmed using ABI
3730XL DNA sequencer by Invitrogen Biotechnology
Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China).
In vivo yeast two-hybrid assay and identification

Matchmaker™ GAL4 Two-Hybrid System 3 Kit, yeast
selective media and other necessary reagents used in
yeast transformation and Y2H assay were purchased
from Clontech Laboratories, Inc. After testing the bait
and prey constructs for autoactivation and toxicity, a
total of twelve yeast co-transformations were performed
to identify interactions of NS80-NS80 (pGBKT7-NS80
& pGADT7-NS80), NS80-NS38 (pGBKT7-NS80 &
pGADT7-NS38), NS80-VP4 (pGBKT7-NS80 &
pGADT7-VP4), NS80-VP6 (pGBKT7-NS80 & pGADT7VP6), NS38-NS38 (pGBKT7-NS38 & pGADT7-NS38),
NS38-VP4 (pGBKT7-NS38 & pGADT7-VP4), NS38VP6 (pGBKT7-NS38 & pGADT7-VP6), VP4-VP4
(pGBKT7-VP4 & pGADT7-VP4), VP4-VP6 (pGBKT7VP4& pGADT7-VP6), VP6-VP6 (pGBKT7-VP6&
pGADT7-VP6), 53-T (pGBKT7-53 & pGADT7-T, positive control), and Lam-T (pGBKT7-Lam & pGADT7-T,
negative control). Briefly, for each transformation, 100
ng of bait recombinant plasmid and 100 ng of prey
recombinant plasmid were mixed and transformed into
Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109 in small scale reactions
according to the Clontech Kit User Manual (PT3247-1).
The transformants were then grown at 30°C on SD

(synthetically defined) medium. Each yeast transformation was grown on both plates of SD/-Leu-Trp (Double
Dropout, ab. DDO) and SD/-Ade-His-Leu-Trp (Quadruple Dropout, ab. QDO).
Yeast AH109 transformants were inoculated into 5 mL
DDO broth and incubated, shaking at 30°C until OD600
reached an approximate concentration of 0.4-0.6. Aspirated 5 μL of the each cultured transformant and inoculated onto both plates of DDO and QDO containing 1 ×
BU salts (pH 7.0) and X-Gal (ab. DDO/X and QDO/X,
respectively). The remaining cultures were centrifuged
and used to isolate the co-transformed plasmids by E.Z.
N.A.™ Yeast Plasmid Kit (Omega, USA) and PCR identification performed. For preparation of yeast cultures
and protein extracts, we referred to the Clontech Yeast
Protocols Handbook (PT3024-1). The Urea/SDS method
recommended in this instruction was used to extract
yeast total proteins. For Western blotting, NS80 specific
antiserum that was previously described was employed
as primary antibody [33]. The alkaline phosphatase
coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma, USA) was used as
secondary antibody. The result was visualized by developing with NBT/BCIP AP substrate solution (Promega,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Phylogenetic and bioinformatic analyses

For phylogenetic analysis, NS80 deduced amino acid
sequence and related reference sequences were checked
manually and edited by using ClustalX software [34].
The MEGA 3.1 software package was used to construct
NS80’s phylogenetic tree by the neighbor-joining distance method [35]. The reliability of the inferred tree
was tested with 1000 bootstrap replicates.
For bioinformatic analyses, a total of three online programs were used to analyze sequences of NS80 and its
homologues extracted from NCBI GenBank database.
NS80 primary structure alignment was performed by
running the NCBI blastp search tool (http://blast.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). The Multicoil program was used
to predict NS80 a-helical coiled-coil regions and generate custom figures (http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cb/multicoil/cgi-bin/multicoil.cgi). Multiple sequence alignment
(MSA) was performed by the ClustalW program to
obtain conserved regions and residues (http://myhits.isbsib.ch/cgi-bin/clustalw).

Results
Identification of GCRV NS80, NS38, VP4, and VP6
interactions by Y2H assay

GCRV NS80, NS38, VP4, and VP6 encoding genes were
cloned into the Clontech Y2H bait plasmid pGBKT7 and
prey plasmid pGADT7 respectively, and the following eight
constructs: pGBKT7-NS80, pGADT7-NS80, pGBKT7NS38, pGADT7-NS38, pGBKT7-VP4, pGADT7-VP4,

Cai et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:168

pGBKT7-VP6, and pGADT7-VP6 were successfully
obtained. The validities of these recombinant plasmids
were confirmed by sequencing.
For yeast AH109 co-transformation assay, bait-prey
protein pairs of NS80-NS80, NS80-NS38, NS80-VP4,
NS80-VP6, NS38-NS38, 53-T (positive control) could
grow on both DDO and QDO plates, however, NS38VP4, NS38-VP6, VP4-VP4, VP4-VP6, VP6-VP6, and
Lam-T (negative control) could grow on DDO plates
but not QDO plates (summarized in Figure 1). Expression of interacting proteins in co-transformed AH109
strain must have the ability to activate all report genes
and to be cultured on both DDO and QDO plates.
Hence, only protein pairs of NS80-NS80, NS80-NS38,
NS80-VP4, NS80-VP6, NS38-NS38, and 53-T could be
the candidates of positive interactions. As we know,
interacting proteins constructs in yeast transformants
could not only grow on both DDO and QDO plates but
also form blue colonies. According to the phenotype
assessment on both DDO/X and DDO/X plates (Figure
1), the NS80 protein could interact with itself, NS38,
VP4, or VP6. The NS38 protein interacted with itself
but not with VP4 or VP6. The VP4 protein had no
interaction with itself or VP6. We could not make a
conclusion for self-interaction of the VP6 protein, as
transformants could not grow on QDO plates although
they could grow on DDO plates and formed blue
colonies.
To analyze yeast plasmid inserts, all the respective cotransformed bait and prey recombinant plasmids were
isolated and could be amplified by PCR identification
(data not shown). Moreover, the NS80 protein expression could be detected by Western blotting using NS80
rabbit antiserum as the first antibody (data not shown).
These results indicated that the bait and prey plasmids
could well replicate and express in yeast cells.
Phylogenetic characterization of GCRV NS80

In order to understand the evolutionary relationship
between the NS80 protein and other known homologues, phylogenetic analysis was performed. A representative phylogenetic tree based on deduced amino acid
sequences of NS80 and its homologues was constructed (Figure 2). The tree was divided into three
distinct clades: the ARV clade, the MRV clade, and the
Aquareovirus clade. The ARV clade and the MRV
clade were close members belonging to the Orthoreovirus genus, but they were phylogenetically distant
from the Aquareovirus clade. Phylogenetic analysis of
NS80 also revealed that the ARV clade was closer to
the Aquareovirus clade than to the MRV clade which
seemed to be similar to the phylogenesis of host species that belong to Aves, Pisces, and Mammalia,
respectively.

Bioinformatic analyses of GCRV NS80

Bioinformatic analyses were performed to further
explore the roles of NS80 in GCRV genome replication
and particle assembly. Pairwise comparisons of NS80
with homologues of ARVs or MRVs revealed amino
acid identity ranging from 24% to 25%, or 21% to 22%,
respectively. Both NCBI blastp (Figure 3A) and ClustalW MSF analysis (Figure 4B) indicated that NS80 and
its homologues only had identities in their carboxylproximal region which has already been proved sufficiently to form VFLS in MRVs [17,20]. According to the
Multicoil prediction program, two a-helical coiled-coils
(aa ~513-550 and aa ~615-690, respectively) were also
predicted in the carboxyl-proximal terminus region
(Figure 3B). Two conserved regions (aa ~388-443 and
aa ~562-580, respectively) and corresponding conserved
residues (Ala395, Gly419, Asp421, Pro422, Leu438, and
Leu443 for the former; Tyr565, His569, Cys571, Asn573
and Glu576 for the latter) were discovered in the NS80
protein by MSA analysis (Figure 4B). So far as we
known, the first conserved region and corresponding
residues have not been reported to be associated with
any known functions of NS80 or its homologues in
MRVs and ARVs. However, the second conserved
region (located in the linker domain, Figure 4A) and the
two predicted coiled-coils have been shown to be
required for forming VFLS in both MRVs and ARVs
[17,20]. According to the above findings, we conclude
that the minimum region of GCRV NS80 required for
the VFLS formation should be in the range of amino
acid residues from ~513 to 742. The one third of the
NS80 amino region with no identities or implications
(Figure 3) is thought to interact with other proteins or
nascent RNA that is facilitated for VFLS formation.

Discussion
Since Fields and Song firstly described the yeast twohybrid system [36], it has been become a powerful
genetic approach to identify protein-protein interaction
(PPI) in vivo. The system can be applied in three scenarios: novel PPI identification, putative PPI confirmation,
and definition of interacting domains. For application in
reovirus PPI identification, Becker et al. reported MRV
μNS could interact with sNS but not with outer capsid
protein s3 using the Clontech Y2H system [12].
Another recent associated investigation indicated that
ARV μNS could interact with itself using the Clontech
mammalian two-hybrid system [20]. In this study, the
protein NS80 was first identified to have interactions
with NS38, VP4 and VP6 except for NS80 and NS38
self-interactions, indicating that the NS80 and NS38
proteins are capable of both homologous and heterogenous interactions. At the same time, no interactions
could be detected between protein pairs NS38-VP4,

NS38-VP6, VP4-VP4, VP4-VP6, suggesting dominant
protein interactions happened in NS80 during the viral
life cycle. However, for VP6 self-interaction, we could
not draw a definite conclusion, since three reporter
genes including HIS3 (synthesis of histidine), ADE2
(synthesis of adenine), and lacZ (expression of b-galactosidase) should be simultaneously activated to define

positive interactions, but only lacZ was expressed in the
Y2H assay. Taking into consideration that blue colonies
formed on DDO/X plates, maybe this was caused by
protein misfolding, and further confirmation, by using
another PPI system is necessary.
Bioinformatic analysis is a very useful tool for predict
protein function and functional domains and was

applied to provide information related to NS80 function.
Blastp analysis indicated GCRV NS80 and MRVs/ARVs
μNS only displayed weak identities in the carboxyl-proximal region, however, this region is required for formation of VFLS of NS80 in Aquareovirus and μNS in
Orthoreovirus and remains relatively conserved amongst
different host species. It has been proved that the MRVs
μNS carboxyl-terminal one-third region (aa 471-721) is

the smallest region necessary for forming VFLS [17],
and the GCRV NS80 carboxyl-terminal region (aa 335742) has been characterized to have the same phenotype
[33]. It is important to note, however, this region spanning from aa residues 335 to 742 is apparently sufficient
but not essential for this phenotype. Based on our analysis, the necessary or smallest region for VFLS formation
in NS80 is located in aa residues 513-742, although this

needs to be experimentally confirmed in subsequent studies. We also note that it has been reported that the
second conserved region of NS80 and five conserved
amino acid residues (Tyr565, His569, Cys571, Asn573
and Glu576) located between the two coiled-coils are
thought to be necessary and crucial to the VFLS formation, and which has been proved to cause the loss of the
VFLS formation phenotype in MRVs/ARVs by mutating
either the conserved His or Cys residue or by truncating
this region [17,20].
As previously reported in MRVs, the first 40 residues
of the μNS N-terminus are sufficient for interaction
with both sNS (NS38’s homolog) and μ2 (VP4’s

homolog), and the region of 173-221 residues is sufficient for interaction with s2 (VP6’s homolog) [21].
Although we have experimentally proved NS80 interacts
with NS38, VP4, and VP6, we could not predict the
interacting domains because no conserved residues were
discovered in the corresponding position by either
blastp or MSF analyses. The μNS amino-terminal region
of 1-221 residues was sufficient to interact with sNS,
l1, l2, μ2, and s2 [21], however, no conserved residues
were identified in the NS80 amino-terminal region by
aligning analogous proteins from the genera of Aquareovirus and Orthoreovirus using the ClustalW program,
which indicates the amino-terminal region is highly

Cai et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:168
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/168

divergent. It is likely that the N-terminal functional
regions of NS80 are species special to dominate interactions with related components.
The NS80/μNS is approximately divided into three
regions, the carboxyl-terminal one-third region is
involved in VFLS formation and the amino-terminal
one-third region may be associated with protein recruitments. But the roles of the middle one-third region
have never been investigated and remain unknown.
Based on our bioinformatic analysis, the presence of a
conserved region (aa ~388-443 for NS80) including six
conserved amino acid residues (Ala395, Gly419, Asp421,
Pro422, Leu438, and Leu443 for NS80) located in this
region is reported here for the first time, which suggests
novel functions might be explored in NS80/μNS.
In this study, we established that NS80 interacted with
itself, NS38, VP4, or VP6 and the NS38 self-interaction,
characterized the phylogenesis of NS80, and proposed
the potential functional regions. The results contribute a
basic understanding of NS80 VFLS formation and interaction with other proteins during GCRV replication and
particle assembly, moreover, the study provides valuable
information for further experimental design and investigation of NS80 functions.

Conclusion
Based on our investigation, it is suggested that GCRV
NS80 shares common roles with MRVs/ARVs μNS in
VFLS formation and other viral components recruitment
during viral replication and assembly. Our findings give
a better understanding of NS80 functions and also provide guidance for the further study of this multifunctional protein.
