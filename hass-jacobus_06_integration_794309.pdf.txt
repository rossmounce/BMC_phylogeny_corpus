Abstract
Background: With the completion of the genome sequence for rice (Oryza sativa L.), the focus of rice genomics
research has shifted to the comparison of the rice genome with genomes of other species for gene cloning, breeding,
and evolutionary studies. The genus Oryza includes 23 species that shared a common ancestor 8–10 million years ago
making this an ideal model for investigations into the processes underlying domestication, as many of the Oryza species
are still undergoing domestication. This study integrates high-throughput, hybridization-based markers with BAC end
sequence and fingerprint data to construct physical maps of rice chromosome 1 orthologues in two wild Oryza species.
Similar studies were undertaken in Sorghum bicolor, a species which diverged from cultivated rice 40–50 million years ago.
Results: Overgo markers, in conjunction with fingerprint and BAC end sequence data, were used to build sequenceready BAC contigs for two wild Oryza species. The markers drove contig merges to construct physical maps syntenic to
rice chromosome 1 in the wild species and provided evidence for at least one rearrangement on chromosome 1 of the
O. sativa versus Oryza officinalis comparative map. When rice overgos were aligned to available S. bicolor sequence, 29%
of the overgos aligned with three or fewer mismatches; of these, 41% gave positive hybridization signals. Overgo
hybridization patterns supported colinearity of loci in regions of sorghum chromosome 3 and rice chromosome 1 and

suggested that a possible genomic inversion occurred in this syntenic region in one of the two genomes after the
divergence of S. bicolor and O. sativa.
Conclusion: The results of this study emphasize the importance of identifying conserved sequences in the reference
sequence when designing overgo probes in order for those probes to hybridize successfully in distantly related species.
As interspecific markers, overgos can be used successfully to construct physical maps in species which diverged less than
8 million years ago, and can be used in a more limited fashion to examine colinearity among species which diverged as
much as 40 million years ago. Additionally, overgos are able to provide evidence of genomic rearrangements in
comparative physical mapping studies.

Background
Rice is the world's most important agronomic plant. In
Asia, home to 70% of the world's poor, rice provides up
to two-thirds of the population's daily caloric intake and
as much as 60% of the daily protein intake [1]. Efforts to
improve our understanding of rice genetics, thereby
improving the breeding and cultivation of rice, have led to
numerous international collaborations, culminating in
the completion of a publicly available genome sequence
of rice in 2002 [2,3]. This sequence provides a powerful
tool for the identification of agronomically important
genes in rice, as well as for the identification of orthologous regions in other crop species. With a sequence in
hand, the focus for rice geneticists has shifted to the integration of rice physical and genetic maps[4], and comparison of the rice genome to genomes of other species, both
for comparative gene cloning efforts and evolutionary
studies [5,6].
The genus Oryza, of which cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.)
is a member, includes 23 species from a widely diverse
range of habitats. Wild rice species can be found in Central and South America, Australia, Africa, and Asia, while
O. sativa is distributed worldwide, in both temperate and
tropical climates [7]. Rice research is now looking to the
wild rice species to help answer questions about domestication, speciation, polyploidy, and to furnish genes for
breeding purposes [8]. However, there are no plans at this
time for an international full genome sequencing effort of
these species. Therefore, other methods must be
employed to harness the knowledge hidden in these wild
rice genomes.

mammals, birds, and reptiles. These probes are again constructed using whole genome alignments between
human, mouse, and rat as the basis for probe design. In
order to build BAC-based physical maps of wild rice, we
used the rice sequence to design overgo probes for hybridization to BAC libraries of eleven wild rice species.
Because no other monocot species has been completely
sequenced, we could not use multiple-species sequence
alignments for probe design, and instead relied on hits to
plant EST databases to design probes from putatively conserved regions.
Cultivated rice is a diploid species (2n = 24) of the AA
genome type [7,8,11]. The wild rice species used in this
study represent a diverse evolutionary background,
including both diploid and tetraploid species encompassing 8–10 million years of divergence [12] (Figure 1). In
addition to the Oryza species, we tested the effectiveness
of rice overgos when hybridized to Sorghum bicolor L.
Moench, a species within the Gramineae but outside of
the genus Oryza that diverged from rice 40–50 million
years ago [13] (Figure 1).
We will discuss the success rates of our overgos in hybridizations to O. sativa, the species from which the overgos
were designed, to eleven wild rice species in the genus
Oryza, and to the more distantly related grass S. bicolor. We
will then report on the use of these overgos for ongoing
physical and comparative mapping projects in two of the
wild rice species and for comparative mapping in S.
bicolor.

Results
Recent comparative genomics studies in animals have
used overgo (overlapping oligonucleotide) probes to construct sequence-ready contigs of large-insert clones in
multiple species. Thomas et al. (2002) [9] designed
probes from conserved regions of human-mouse alignments and used them to construct sequence-ready, bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based physical maps for
six other mammalian species. More recently, Kellner et al.
(2005) [10] reported improved probe design algorithms
that are being used to design overgo probe sets which can
identify most genes or regions of interest in placental

Overgo design and hybridization success in Oryza species
The goal of this project was to design overgo markers from
the rice (O. sativa) genomic sequence [14], hybridize
those overgos to BAC libraries constructed from wild
Oryza species, and use the data generated, in conjunction
with BAC fingerprinting and BAC end sequencing data
generated by the Oryza Map Alignment Project (OMAP)
[15], to link the physical maps of the wild Oryza species to
the O. sativa reference genome sequence. The first step
toward achieving this goal was to identify potential overgos from the rice reference sequence. In total, 1728 of the

potential overgo marker sequences spanning all sequence
contigs of O. sativa chromosome 1, were identified as having fit our selection criteria. While our optimum target
density was one overgo every 25,000 bp along rice chromosome 1, the spacing between selected overgos along
the chromosome ranged from 20,001 bp apart to 58,526
bp apart, for a mean spacing of 24,401 bp between overgos (Table 1). To test the efficacy of overgos designed from
sequences of other rice chromosomes, an additional 144
overgos were designed from chromosome 3 and were
spaced an average of 246,268 bp apart (Table 1). 864 of
the selected overgos (6 12 × 12 two dimensional pooling
arrays) were used for BAC library hybridizations. Data
from 72 of the 864 overgos hybridized, whose failures
were traced to laboratory errors, were not included in the
further analyses.
We labelled an overgo as successful if the overgo identified at least one positive clone. Figure 2 shows the success
rates of overgos hybridized to the O. sativa library as determined by three methods. The first two analyses shown on
the chart were performed to provide an estimate of the
success of overgos in one dimension when used as pooled
probes. Previous studies have defined overgo success as an
overgo identifying at least one positive clone, regardless of
whether the clone actually hybridized to the sequence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/199

from which it was designed. In addition to doing the same
analysis in our study, we desired a more accurate picture
of overgo success in terms of whether overgos are actually
hybridizing to the sequences in the regions from which
they were designed. While some clone data in FPC and
BES alignments to the rice sequence data is ambiguous,
these alignments can provide an estimate of overgo success, defined as an overgo successfully hybridizing to the
clone(s) to which we expect it to hybridize. Predicted
clone data from the alignments of the FPC and BES maps
to the rice pseudomolecule were used to calculate the percentage of overgos that identified at least one FPC or BES
clone, respectively, in at least one dimension. The list of
BAC clones identified by a twelve-overgo pool was compared to a list of clones expected to be detected by a given
overgo from that pool, based on either FPC or BES data. If
at least one predicted clone was found by the pool, the
overgo was counted as successful. These two analyses can
only be used for O. sativa, the positive control species,
because that is the only species for which we have complete, sequence-anchored fingerprint (FPC) and BES data.
Overall, 82% of the 792 overgos tested found at least one
FPC-predicted clone in at least one dimension, while 78%
of the overgos found at least one BES-predicted clone in at
least one dimension. Broken down by chromosome, 83%
of the chromosome 1 overgos tested found at least one
FPC-predicted clone in at least one dimension, while 77%
of the overgos found at least one BES-predicted clone in at
least one dimension. 78% of the chromosome 3 overgos
tested found at least one FPC-predicted clone in at least
one dimension, while 80% of the overgos found at least
one BES-predicted clone in at least one dimension. Twodimensional success rates were consistently lower than
either of the one-dimensional rates. This result is
expected, as the failure of an overgo in either of the two
dimensions would result in an overall false negative
result. As seen in Figure 2, 60% of the tested overgos identified at least one BAC clone in both dimensions. Based
on the average one-dimensional percentages, the maximum expected percentage of overgos that would detect at
least one overgo in two dimensions is estimated to be
(0.82 × 0.82 =) 67%. Therefore an estimated 7% of overgos overall were successful in one dimension but failed in
the second dimension, although the chromosome 3 overgos had a 16% higher two-dimensional success rate than
the chromosome 1 overgos.
Table 2 lists the success rates of overgos for all of the Oryza
species tested, as well as the percentage of successful overgos that were designed from EST sequences in each case.
Species are listed in the table in phylogenetic order,
according to Ge et al. (1999). Not surprisingly, the greatest percentage of overgos were successful in O. rufipogon,
an AA genome species like O. sativa. Hybridization success
rates fell as species lower in the phylogenetic hierarchy

were examined. Overgos hybridized least successfully to
O. brachyantha (FF genome), O. ridleyi (HHJJ genome),
and O. granulata (GG genome), the most basal genomes
in the Oryza phylogeny. As hypothesized, the sequences
from which the overgos were designed became more critical with increasing evolutionary distance from O. sativa.
Approximately 50% of all overgos designed showed similarity to sequences in the EST databases. As shown in
Table 2, 54% of the overgos that hybridized successfully
to the O. sativa BAC library were designed from EST
sequences. This is the expected result, since overgos
designed from O. sativa should hybridize back to the O.
sativa genome regardless of the character of the overgo
sequence. Genic regions, from which EST sequences are
derived, tend to be more conserved during evolution, so
we hypothesized that overgos not designed from EST

sequence would not work as well as EST-derived overgos
as we moved farther down the phylogenetic order of species. We observed that as we tested species more evolutionarily distant from O. sativa, in particular non-AA
genome species, fewer non-EST-derived overgos were successful in hybridizing to a particular library. In the species
most distantly related to O. sativa, 80–83% of the successful overgos were derived from EST sequences.
Hybridization of overgos to Sorghum
To determine the ability of probes to detect sequences of
a more distantly related member of the grass family we
conducted a pilot study using Sorghum bicolor. Previously,
Klein et al. (2003) [16] constructed an integrated genetic
and physical map of sorghum and demonstrated extensive colinearity over the lengths of chromosome 3 and rice
chromosome 1 [16]. For the current experiment, 3402
physically mapped sorghum BAC clones, spanning ~60
Mb of chromosome 3 (~10X coverage), were hybridized
with 288 randomly selected overgo probes. Sixteen probes
(5.6%) successfully identified at least one BAC clone, consistent with the trend of decreasing hybridization success
rate with increasing evolutionary distance from rice. To
better understand the relationship between hybridization
success rate and sequence conservation we examined the
level of probe-target mismatches in available sorghum
sequences. Although available sequence of sorghum is
limited, we were able to identify EST and genome survey
sequences corresponding to regions of rice that encompass 283 of the 1721 probes, and these were subsequently
examined by BLASTN to determine the level of mismatches. As shown in Figure 3, fewer than 4% of probes
had zero mismatches, while approximately half had six or
greater mismatches. We note that this sample of probes is
biased toward greater conservation than the probe set as a
whole since it excludes probes targeted to regions of rice
for which no homologues exist in sorghum. Among

probes for which we were able to obtain mismatch data,
the hybridization success rate was 23% (9 out of 39). This
was significantly higher (P < 0.001, chi-square test) than
the success rate of probes for which no mismatch data was
obtainable, which was 3% (7 out of 242). We further
found that among the nine positively-hybridizing probes
for which we have mismatch data, all but one had six or
fewer mismatches, while the success rate among all 20
probes having six or fewer mismatches was 40%, compared to only 5.6% (1 out of 19) for probes having greater
than 6 mismatches (data not shown).

Distribution of mismatches between rice overgos and SorDistribution of mismatches between rice overgos
and Sorghum sequence. The percentage of 36 bp overgo
probes having 0 to >6 mismatches to available Sorghum
sequence is shown. Sorghum sequences corresponding to
regions of rice from which overgo probes were designed
were identified using BLAT alignment data available from the
Gramene (version 19) database [33]. Overgo sequences
were aligned to Sorghum sequence by BLASTN using an
open-gap cost of two and a gap-extension cost of one, with
low-complexity filtration turned off.

Comparative mapping of the rice and wild rice (Oryza)
genomes
Clone data from the overgo probe hybridizations, in conjunction with clone fingerprint data, was used to construct
physical maps of the rice chromosome 1 orthologues in
O. nivara and O. officinalis. The O. nivara physical map of
chromosome 1 is shown in Figure 4. While in most cases
it is not possible to ascertain whether overgo markers were
solely responsible for contig builds or merges in the physical map, we have determined that at least 89 of the
overgo markers shown in Figure 4 confirmed the in silico
alignment of the BES to the corresponding pseudomolecule of O. sativa chromosome 1, providing robustness to
the physical map. Close inspection of the physical maps
also revealed areas where overgos aided in the assembly of
contigs, especially by bringing together clones in areas of
low coverage. Three examples of these areas are shown in
Figure 5.

Figure 6 illustrates a contig of the O. officinalis genome
that was originally assigned to rice chromosome 11 based
on the alignment of BES data from an FPC contig to the
rice sequence, although repeats and duplications in the
region caused this to be characterized as an ambiguous
assignment. Four overgo markers resolved the ambiguity,
allowing the contig to be placed unambiguously on the
rice chromosome 1 comparative map. Overgos have also
confirmed the placement of contigs around at least one
region of the O. officinalis genome containing a chromosomal rearrangement. This is shown in Figure 7, where
two overgos support an inversion in the comparative map
of O. officinalis with rice chromosome 1. Three additional
overgos upstream of this rearrangement point to colinearity of the chromosome outside of the putative inversion
breakpoints.
The assembly and alignment of physical contigs from a
wild rice species to the reference genome is often made

each alignment. Green lines stretching from the O. nivara pseudomolecule to the O. sativa pseudomolecule in each alignment
show where clones from the O. nivara contig align to the O. sativa chromosome, while purple lines show where O. nivara clones'
BESs align to the O. sativa pseudomolecule. In (D), blue vertical lines on the left half of the figure represent O. nivara BAC
clones. Circles on the ends of the clones represent BESs. Open circles are BESs that did not match sequences from O. sativa,
while closed circles are BESs that matched O. sativa sequences. Purple lines stretching from a BES on the left to the pseudomolecule on the right show where the BES to which the line is attached aligns to the pseudomolecule. In the case of overgo markers, a marker will often hit more than one BAC clone. Green lines stretch from the middle of all clones hit by that marker to a

sequence is located on the pseudomolecule, thereby showing where the O. nivara clones hit by the marker align to the O. sativa

Alignment of O. officinalis contig to region of rice chromosome 1 showing putative inversion
Figure 7
Alignment of O. officinalis contig to region of rice chromosome 1 showing putative inversion. Alignment of an O.
officinalis contig to rice chromosome 1. Overgos confirm the placement of clones in the contig such that a putative genomic
inversion of the region stretching from approximately 21.94 MB to 23.40 MB on the rice pseudomolecule is apparent. The
brown bar on the right side of the figure represents a portion of the O. sativa chromosome 1 pseudomolecule, and the coordinates along the pseudomolecule are listed in blue on the righthand side of the pseudomolecule. Blue vertical lines on the left
half of the figure represent O. officinalis BAC clones. Circles on the ends of the clones represent BAC end sequences (BES).
Open circles are BESs that did not match sequences from O. sativa, while closed circles are BESs that matched O. sativa
sequences. Purple lines stretching from a BES on the left to the pseudomolecule on the right show where the BES to which the
line is attached aligns to the pseudomolecule. Red text on the left side of the figure shows the names of overgo markers with
hits to clones in the O. officinalis BAC contig shown. In the case of overgo markers, a marker will often hit more than one BAC
clone. Green lines stretch from the middle of all clones hit by that marker to a red "marker join dot." The green line stretching
from the marker join dot to the pseudomolecule shows where the marker sequence is located on the pseudomolecule,
thereby showing where the O. officinalis clones hit by the marker align to the O. sativa pseudomolecule.

we drew a comparative map of sorghum chromosome 3
and rice chromosome 1. Shown in Figure 9, the map displays long-range colinearity between the two chromosomes, with the exception of one locus showing evidence
of having relocated in one lineage relative to the other. In
addition, the map detects an inversion event that was previously shown to encompass most of the short arms of
each chromosome [16]. These results are in agreement
with previous findings of a syntenic relationship between
these chromosomes, with small-scale changes resulting
from movement of individual or small clusters of genes
[16,18].

Discussion

Comparative map between Sorghum chromosome 3 and rice
Comparative map between Sorghum chromosome 3
and rice chromosome 1. Hybridization of overgo probes
detected the indicated BAC clones, which were previously
anchored to the Sorghum genetic map using a variety of
molecular markers [16, 17]. The rice physical map is based
on the TIGR Release 3 pseudochromosome assembly [39].
The data show a previously identified inversion event affecting the short arms of the chromosomes. Probe 5jp233835
identified a locus that has possibly moved in one lineage relative to the other.

more difficult by lower degrees of synteny between the
two species in these areas, as well as by the presence of
repetitive elements and rearrangements. In these cases,
overgo markers confirmed orthologous tracks in the chromosomes of the wild species in reference to O. sativa. One
example of this can be seen in O. officinalis. Contig 15,
shown in Figure 8A, was merged with O. officinalis contig
188 (Figure 8B), based on the hybridization of overgo
7jp629101 to BAC clones from both contigs. After this
merger, fingerprint data then pointed to a merger of contig 16 with contig 15/188, a merger that could not be
made from fingerprint data alone, but which was driven
by overgo 7jp629101 (data not shown). In the process,
the data from the same overgo resolved a false inversion
that had been observed in contig 15 prior to the merger.
Comparative mapping of the rice and Sorghum genomes
Based on the probe-to-BAC hybridization data and the
integrated genetic and physical maps of sorghum [16,17],

Overgo probes have been gaining popularity as markers
for large-scale physical mapping of both plant and animal
genomes. They are particularly useful for screening largeinsert libraries to identify clones belonging to regions of
interest, or to identify clones to sequence and fingerprint
for contig assembly [19,20]. One disadvantage of overgos
is that good quality sequence information must be available from which to design the probe. In addition, repeat
databases that can be used to filter out repetitive probes
are also essential. On the other hand, overgo probes can
be designed from sequences that are too short for optimal
PCR primer selection when a hybridization probe from
the region is needed. Overgo probes can also be labelled
to a high specific activity and can be pooled easily, making
them ideal candidates for high-throughput physical mapping [19].
The criteria used to select overgos for hybridization experiments play a huge role in the success of these markers.
Most of the studies reported to date in both plants and
animals have used overgos designed from the sequence of
one species to probe clone libraries of that same species
[4,21-30]. In animals, where comprehensive sequence
data is available for many species, overgos have been
designed from the conserved regions of aligned sequences
from multiple species [9,10,31,32]. The overgo design
process for our rice comparative mapping project presented a unique problem. As evidenced in the studies
cited above, it is necessary to design overgos as much as
possible to conserved regions for successful cross-species
hybridizations, yet the plant community does not have
the large repository of complete sequence data that exists
for animal and microbial species. At the time this study
began, Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. was the only plant
species that had been sequenced to completion, although
rice chromosome 1 had been completed and the rest of
the rice sequence was soon published [2,3]. While a multispecies alignment approach to overgo selection is preferable, these resources were not available, so we selected
overgos with a bias towards hits to available plant EST
databases.

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:199

The success rate of overgos in this study was 82%, a rate
that is comparable to the rates reported by other studies
[21-23,27,29,31]. Our two-dimensional overgo success
rate also closely matches the rate we would expect based
on the overall success of overgos in one dimension. Additionally, these rates are supported by the fact that overgos
not only had to positively hybridize to a clone, but that
the clone must map to the expected location in the FPC
and BES maps, criteria not used by prior studies using
overgos. The two-dimensional success rate could be
improved in future experiments by the addition of additional dimensions, possibly coupled with an increase in
the number of overgos per pool. Using three dimensions
and requiring a positive result in two of the three dimensions, for example, would increase the success rate by
reducing the number of false negatives due to the failure
of an overgo in one of the dimensions. In addition, our
data point to a need for the continuous improvement of
available sequence databases within the plant community, particularly EST databases; the continued sequencing
of other genomes that could be aligned to rice to disclose
regions of sequence conservation will also contribute to
improved overgo design and an increase in probe success.
We have shown that this is particularly important for
cross-species hybridizations. For example, while only
26% of the overgos successfully hybridized to O. coarctata
BAC clones, 83% of the overgos that were successful were
designed from EST sequences. This fact was also shown by
our Sorghum data, in which 40% of rice overgos with six
or fewer mismatches to Sorghum yielded positive hybridization results, compared to only 5.6% of overgos with
greater than six mismatches. The improvement of repeat
databases to screen out overgos designed from repetitive
regions will also be crucial to future cross-species overgo
success.
Even given the current overgo design constraints, this
study shows that overgos can be used successfully as
markers for the construction of physical maps, as evidenced by our data from O. nivara and O. officinalis.
Besides confirming the placement of clones into contigs
using fingerprint data, we have shown here the use of
these overgo markers to resolve conflicts in the chromosomal assignment of contigs and to drive the merges of
contigs during physical map construction. In addition, we
have shown evidence that overgos can be used successfully to confirm the placement of contigs in and around
regions containing suspected rearrangements in comparative maps, a possibility that will be examined in greater
detail in future investigations. As evolutionary distance
increases relative to the reference genome, it becomes
more difficult to design overgos that will be able to successfully hybridize to the genomes of other species. Yet
even in Sorghum, a species outside of the genus Oryza,
overgo probes were successfully used in this study to aid

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/199

in the construction of a comparative map between rice
and Sorghum, and were able to show micro-synteny
between regions of the Sorghum and rice genomes.

Conclusion
Overgos have been used successfully for physical mapping
in animals, but their utility for physical and comparative
mapping in plants has not been studied as extensively as
in animals. The study presented here shows that overgos
can be successfully hybridized cross-species, and can even
be used with limited success in species as distantly related
as rice and Sorghum. Of particular interest will be the possibility of using overgo probes to target potential regions
of chromosomal rearrangements and to target gaps in the
physical maps to drive the merging of contigs and the
placement of singletons in those maps. The improvement
of sequence databases, including EST databases, and
repeat databases will be instrumental in the successful
design of these probes for cross-species hybridizations.

Methods
Overgo design
Overgo probes consisted of 36 bp stretches of sequence
chosen from the Rice Genome Research Program's publicly available sequence data of the nine contigs of Oryza
sativa japonica L. cv. Nipponbare, chromosome 1 [14].
Each overgo is composed of two 22 mer oligonucleotides
that overlap at their 3' ends via 8 bp of complimentary
sequence. A collection of candidate overgo sequences
were extracted from each contig using the program SOOP
[9], which was modified to display all potential overgos
found in a sequence, instead of only the best overgo for a
given sequence. Candidate overgos were discarded unless
they were composed of 44–56% GC bases and displayed
less than 24/36 bases (32/36 bases for the pilot overgo set,
plate 21) of sequence identity to other sites on the chromosome from which they were extracted. The remaining
candidate overgos were then scored against publicly available databases [33] as follows. For chromosome 1 candidate overgos, a score of +5 was given for hits to the grain
EST database (excluding Japonica and Indica); +3 for hits
to the Indica EST database; +3 for hits to the Japonica
chromosome 1 EST database; +1 for hits to the Japonica
EST database; -1 for 4 to 7 hits, or -5 for 8 or more hits, to
the Indica genome database; and -2 for 4 to 7 hits, or -5
for 8 or more hits, to the Japonica genome database. For
chromosome 3 candidate overgos, a score of +5 was given
for hits to the grain EST database (excluding Japonica and
Indica); +3 for hits to the Indica EST database; +1 for hits
to the Japonica EST database; and -1 for 4 to 7 hits, or -5
for 8 or more hits, to the Indica genome database. Overgos were given a score of zero if they hit more than once
to the Japonica genome database.

Overgos suitable for use as hybridization probes were
selected to have the best possible score (minimum score
of 8) while achieving an optimum density of one overgo
every 25,000 bp. The overgos were ordered in 96-well
plates from Sigma-Genosys, maximizing the distance
between overgos in a 12 × 12 pooling array to a distance
equalling or exceeding the maximum BAC clone insert
size. Chromosome 1 overgos had an average of 3,610,538
bp between any two overgos in a row pool and 4,243,653
bp between any two overgos in a column pool, while the
chromosome 3 overgos had an average spacing of
2,340,440 bp between any two overgos in a row pool and
1,498,379 bp between any two overgos in a column pool.
All overgo sequences, each overgo's position on the chromosome from which it was designed, the overgo's score,
and the number of times the overgo matches each of the
databases, can be found at http://rice.genomics.pur
due.edu[34]. A list of the sequences and plate positions of
all 864 overgos used in this study is provided [see Additional file 1].

OR_ABa, OR_BBa, and OR_CBa. The overgos designed
from chromosome 3 were tested against all of the libraries
listed above except for OR_CBa. While OSJNBa, OA_ABa,
OA_BBa, and OB__Ba were hybridized against all of the
overgos, the other libraries were incorporated into the
study as they became available and were therefore tested
against only portions of the overgos from those arrays.

BAC libraries
The following 10x or greater coverage BAC libraries were
obtained from the Arizona Genomics Institute [35]:
OSJNBa (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare; AA
genome), OA_ABa (Oryza australiensis Domin.; accession
100882; EE genome), OA_BBa (Oryza alta Swallen; accession 105143; CCDD genome), OB__Ba (Oryza brachyantha A. Chev. et Roehr.; accession 101232; FF genome),
OC__Ba (Oryza coarctata Roxb.; accession 104502; also
known as Porteresia coarctata T.; HHKK genome), OG_ABa
(Oryza granulata Nees et Arn. ex Watt; accession 102118;
GG genome), OM__Ba (Oryza minuta J.S. Presl. ex C.B.
Presl.; accession 101141; BBCC genome), OO__Ba (Oryza
officinalis Wall ex Watt; accession 100896; CC genome),
OP__Ba (Oryza punctata Kotschy ex Steud.; accession
105690; BB genome), OR_ABa (Oryza ridleyi Hook.; accession 100821; HHJJ genome), OR_BBa (Oryza nivara
Sharma et Shastry; accession W0106; AA genome), and
OR_CBa (Oryza rufipogon Griff.; accession 105491; AA
genome).

The resulting colony filters were fixed by treatment with a
series of four solutions in the following manner. In preparation for fixing, Cellulose Chromatography Thick paper
(size 46 × 57 cm; Fisher Scientific cat. no. 05-714-4) was
cut and placed on 26 × 18 inch fiberglass cafeteria trays
(Carlisle cat. no. 2618SL). The chromatography paper was
moistened thoroughly with solution and excess solution
was poured off. Nylon filters were placed on the solutionmoistened paper for a specified period of time and then
either moved to the next solution or dried, as detailed
below. Filters were dried at room temperature by peeling
the filter from moistened paper after incubation and placing it directly on the surface of an empty fiberglass tray.
The fixing regimen proceeded according to the following
steps. Filters were peeled from the surface of the agarsolidified media, treated for 7 minutes with 0.5 N NaOH
and 1.5 M NaCl, then treated for 7 minutes with 1.5 M
NaCl and 0.5 M Tris, (pH 8.0 at 25°C). Next, the filters
were dried for more than one hour, then treated for 20
minutes with 0.4 N NaOH, followed by treatment for 7
minutes with 4X SSPE, pH 7.4. Following these incubations, the filters were allowed to dry overnight. Finally,
each filter was UV cross-linked using a Stratalinker 2400
(Stratagene) set on ''Auto'' to deliver 120 joules/cm2 to
each filter.

One species of note that was included in our study is
Oryza coarctata Roxb., also known as Porteresia coarctata T.
Taxonomists in the 1980s moved the coarctata species out
of the genus Oryza and into the genus Porteresia. Recently,
Ge et al. (1999) [11] found this species to contain an
HHKK genome type, like that of Oryza schlechteri Pilger,
and suggested that the coarctata species be placed back
into the genus Oryza. For that reason, we chose to include
the coarctata species in our study of Oryza wild rice species.
Overgos designed from chromosome 1 were hybridized to
the following BAC libraries: OSJNBa, OA_ABa, OA_BBa,
OB__Ba, OC__Ba, OG_ABa, OM__Ba, OO__Ba, OP__Ba,

Filter printing
High-density nylon filter arrays of each library were fabricated as follows. 22 × 22-cm Hybond N+ nylon filters
(Amersham GE Healthcare cat. no. RPN2222B) were
placed on the surface of 250 mL of agar-solidified LB
media supplemented with 10 mg/ml chloramphenicol
(Sigma cat. no. C-0378) in Qtrays (Genetix cat. no.
x6023). A Total Array System robot (BioRobotics) fitted
with a 0.4 mm 384-pin tool double spotted the contents
of 48 glycerol stock plates (18,432 clones) on each nylon
filter. Qtrays holding the filters were incubated overnight
at 37°C.

Each filter was labelled by hand with the library/filter designation (e.g. OR_BBa A) and a unique serial number
using a black Sanford Uni-Ball fine-point pen. A 1/16"
diameter hole punch (Making Memories) was then used
to punch holes in the filter at the corners of each of the six
panels. Filters generally had a gray background on phosphorimager scans or autoradiographs. The holes in the filter appeared as white spots in an otherwise gray

background and were used as guides to determine hit
coordinates in ComboScreen (see Data Analysis below).
Overgo labelling and hybridization
Forward and reverse oligonucleotides for each overgo
were obtained from Sigma-Genosys at a stock concentration of 100 µM. Overgo probes were labelled and BAC filters hybridized using protocols previously described
[19,20,31], with minor modifications. Forward and
reverse oligonucleotides for each overgo were combined
to a working concentration of 0.2 pmol/µL. For each
labelling reaction, 4.5 µL of this working solution was
incubated at 80°C for 5 minutes, followed by 37°C for 10
minutes, to anneal the 3' ends of the oligonucleotides. To
the annealed overgos for each reaction, 1.6 µL OLB [20],
4 µg Bovine Serum Albumin (New England Biolabs cat.
no. B9001S), 4 µCi [α32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences cat. no. AA0005), 4 µCi [α32P]dATP
(3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences cat. no. AA0004),
0.8 units DNA Polymerase I Large (Klenow) Fragment
(New England Biolabs cat. no. M0210L), and water were
added to a final reaction volume of 8 µL. The reactions
were incubated at room temperature for 1.5 hours, then
combined into pools of twelve probes each and purified
through NICK columns (Amersham Biosciences cat. no.
17-0855-02), eluting the probe in 400 µL TE buffer (pH
8.0).

BAC filters were soaked in 2X SSC [36], then prehybridized in 50 mL Church Buffer [36] for 30 minutes at 58°C.
Probes were denatured at 95°C for 5 minutes, chilled on
ice for 2 minutes, then 80 µL of probe was added to each
hybridization bottle and the filters were hybridized at
58°C overnight. Filters were washed in 1.5X SSC and
0.1% SDS at 58°C for 30 minutes and then in 1.0X SSC
and 0.1% SDS at 58°C for 30 minutes. Filters were
exposed to 23 × 25 cm type MS imaging plates (FUJIFILM
Medical Systems USA, Inc., cat. no. YBIP2325MS) for at
least 17 hours, then the imaging plates were scanned
using the FLA-5000 imaging system with Image Reader
FLA-5000 v2.1 and ImageGauge 4.0 software (FUJIFILM
Medical Systems USA, Inc.) at 16 bit gradation and a resolution of 200 µm. Images were cropped, labelled, and
contrast adjusted using Adobe® Photoshop® CS software.
Data analysis
A two-dimensional pooling strategy was used to identify
the specific probe hybridizing to a specific clone while
reducing the total number of hybridizations needed to
identify all positive clones with all overgos. Overgos were
pooled in 12-overgo pools by row and by column, and
row and column pools were used to probe the BAC filters.
Images from the hybridizations were scored and the data
assimilated into a database format using the program
ComboScreen [37,38]. ComboScreen was modified to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/199

include the following features: image rotation, adjustment of image brightness and contrast, ability to rotate
the grid, ability to copy a sized grid from one panel to
another, sorting of the hybridization bottles list, recall of
scoring information (grid information saved as .gda file),
and the ability to score the intensity of the hybridization
signal. Data were analyzed using custom programs
designed to display data in a web-based format [34].
Anchoring BAC clones to rice sequence
BAC clones from the OSJNBa (O. sativa) library were
anchored to O. sativa chromosome sequences (Release 2)
constructed by The Institute For Genomic Research
(TIGR) [39] from completed BAC sequences produced by
the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project
(IRGSP) [40] using both BAC end sequences (BES) of
OSJNBa clones and fingerprint (FPC) data of the same
clones. BES [41] and FPC [42] data files were obtained
from the Arizona Genomics Institute and Computational
Laboratory (AGI). BLAT [43] was used to generate position data for BES forward and reverse reads on the chromosome sequences. BAC clones were excluded from
further analysis unless both forward and reverse reads
were uniquely positioned and within 300 kb of each
other.

To anchor BAC clones to the O. sativa chromosome
sequence using FPC data, FPC files were converted into
GFF format using a PERL script [44]. The GFF file contains
size and overlap estimates of the FPC clones. Use of these
estimates resulted in smaller chromosome lengths than
those obtained from the chromosome sequences Therefore, manual resizing of the FPC-based map was undertaken as follows. First, clones on either side of the FPC
clone in question were analyzed to find the nearest flanking clones that were both found in the FPC map and
sequenced and positioned on the chromosome sequence.
Once left and right flanking clones were found meeting
those criteria, the clones' sizes and positions in both FPC
and on the chromosome sequence were compared. The
comparisons were then used to stretch or shrink the FPC
clone, then position it between the two sequenced clones
on the chromosome sequence, retaining the original
aspect ratio to maintain relative clone size and position.
