Abstract
Background: Members of plant WRKY transcription factor families are widely implicated in defense
responses and various other physiological processes. For canola (Brassica napus L.), no WRKY genes have
been described in detail. Because of the economic importance of this crop, and its evolutionary
relationship to Arabidopsis thaliana, we sought to characterize a subset of canola WRKY genes in the context
of pathogen and hormone responses.
Results: In this study, we identified 46 WRKY genes from canola by mining the expressed sequence tag
(EST) database and cloned cDNA sequences of 38 BnWRKYs. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using
the conserved WRKY domain amino acid sequences, which demonstrated that BnWRKYs can be divided
into three major groups. We further compared BnWRKYs to the 72 WRKY genes from Arabidopsis and 91
WRKY from rice, and we identified 46 presumptive orthologs of AtWRKY genes. We examined the
subcellular localization of four BnWRKY proteins using green fluorescent protein (GFP) and we observed
the fluorescent green signals in the nucleus only.
The responses of 16 selected BnWRKY genes to two fungal pathogens, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Alternaria
brassicae, were analyzed by quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR). Transcript abundance of 13 BnWRKY
genes changed significantly following pathogen challenge: transcripts of 10 WRKYs increased in abundance,
two WRKY transcripts decreased after infection, and one decreased at 12 h post-infection but increased
later on (72 h). We also observed that transcript abundance of 13/16 BnWRKY genes was responsive to
one or more hormones, including abscisic acid (ABA), and cytokinin (6-benzylaminopurine, BAP) and the
defense signaling molecules jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), and ethylene (ET). We compared these
transcript expression patterns to those previously described for presumptive orthologs of these genes in
Arabidopsis and rice, and observed both similarities and differences in expression patterns.
Conclusion: We identified a set of 13 BnWRKY genes from among 16 BnWRKY genes assayed, that are
responsive to both fungal pathogens and hormone treatments, suggesting shared signaling mechanisms for
these responses. This study suggests that a large number of BnWRKY proteins are involved in the
transcriptional regulation of defense-related genes in response to fungal pathogens and hormone stimuli.

Background
Canola (Brassica napus) is an economically important crop
in Canada and other temperate regions, and is susceptible
to adverse effects by fungal pathogens. Among these, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, causing stem rot and Alternaria brassicae, causing Alternaria black spot, have potential to cause
significant crop losses [1]. Considerable efforts are underway to develop canola varieties that are better able to tolerate these pathogens. We have previously used
proteomics and genomics to survey the global changes in
gene expression that occur as a result of pathogen challenge in canola [2-5].
Plant defense responses include the transcriptional control of expression of stress-responsive genes [6-9], including a number of transcription factors (TFs) whose
abundance is altered as a result of the pathogen challenge.
These TFs are presumably involved in regulating the
expression of defense-related genes, and specifically
include those containing Ethylene Response Factor (ERF)/
Apetala2 (AP2)-domain, homeodomain, basic Leucine
Zipper (bZIP), MYB, WRKY families and other zinc-finger
factors, all of which have been observed to increase in
response to pathogen challenge [10]. These defense-associated TFs can regulate downstream defense-related genes,
and may themselves be regulated by phosphorylation [1114].
The name of the WRKY family itself is derived from the
most prominent feature of these proteins, the WRKY
domain, which constitutes 60 amino acids [11]. In this
WRKY domain, a conserved WRKYGQK heptapeptide is
followed by a C2H2- or C2HC-type of zinc finger motif
[11]. One or two WRKY zinc-finger motifs may be present,
which can bind to the W-box DNA motif (C/T)TGAC(C/
T) [15-19]. Furthermore, cis-elements other than
TTGAC(C/T) have also been identified as a target of the
WRKY domain of a barley WRKY TF [20,21]. The Group I
WRKY TFs contain two WRKY domains: the C-terminal
domain that plays a major role in binding to the W-box,
while the N-terminal WRKY domain affects the binding
affinity [15,16].
WRKY proteins belong to a super-family of zinc finger
proteins [WRKY-Glial Cell Missing (GCM1)] containing
six members [22]. For example, genes coding WRKY proteins were found not only in plants but also in the slime
mold Dictyostelium discoideum and the protist Giardia lamblia, which indicates that WRKYs may have evolved prior
to the evolution of plant phyla [23-25]. Some WRKY functions are thought to be conserved between phylogenetically distant species [26].
WRKY TF genes form large families in plants, with 72
members in Arabidopsis and close to 100 in Oryza sativa

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/68

(rice) [27]. Previous studies have demonstrated that
WRKY TFs are implicated in plant defense responses [14],
sugar signaling [21] and chromatin remodeling [28]. Furthermore, WRKYs have been found to play essential roles
in various normal physiological processes, including
embryogenesis, seed coat and trichome development,
senescence, regulation of biosynthetic pathways, and hormonal signaling [29-34]. As alluded to earlier, abiotic and
biotic stresses are among the major external factors influencing the expression of WRKY genes in plants [11,23,3538] and have been demonstrated to be involved in the
defense against phytopathogens such as bacteria [25,3942]; fungi [43-45]; and viruses [46,47].
The responses of Arabidopsis to pathogens have been
observed to be mediated by signaling pathways [48-50].
For example, salicylic acid (SA) plays a positive role in
plants against biotrophic pathogens, whereas jasmonic
acid/ethylene (JA/ET) appears to be important in the case
of necrotrophic pathogens [50-53]. It is also known that
these (SA and JA/ET) signaling pathways are mutually
antagonistic [54]. In Arabidopsis, it was observed that 49
out of 72 AtWRKY genes are regulated by Pseudomonas
syringae or SA treatment [42]. On the other hand, of JAresponsive TF in Arabidopsis, AtWRKY TFs are one of the
greatest numbers of induced [45]. Moreover, it is observed
that cross-talk of SA- and JA-dependent defense response
could be mediated by AtWRKY70, which is downstream
of nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related gene 1 (NPR1)
[55].
Previous studies have shown that abscisic acid (ABA), a
negative factor in the SA and JA/ET signaling defense
response, did not increase disease resistance [56-60].
However, recent research has demonstrated that ABA has
a positive effect on callose deposition, which could lead to
increased resistance of plants towards some pathogens
[61-63]. Although WRKY TFs have been demonstrated to
be involved in abiotic stress and ABA signaling [31,35,6466], there are no reports available on the role of WRKYs in
ABA-mediated biotic stress responses. The role of other
hormones, such as cytokinins, has been investigated by
many groups and it was observed that cytokinins, serving
as endogenous inducers for distinct classes of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, are necessary for the biosynthesis of SA and JA [67-69]. Others have observed that the
effect of cytokinins is mediated through the stimulation of
ET production [70]. However, whether cytokinins induce
the expression of PR genes through WRKYs is not presently clear.
Despite the obvious importance of WRKYs in responses to
pathogens and hormone signaling, there are no reports as
of yet, describing WRKY TFs in canola and their role(s) in
mediating responses to pathogens. In our previous micro-

array analysis of canola response to S. sclerotiorum, we
identified three WRKY genes whose transcript abundance
was significantly affected by this fungus [5]. These results
prompted us to systematically identify and examine
WRKY TF genes in canola using the large set of available
expressed sequence tags (ESTs). In this study, we analyzed
ESTs from publicly available sequence information of
canola and identified 46 sequences with similarities to
Arabidopsis WRKY TFs. We investigated the evolutionary
relationship of canola WRKY TFs with their counterparts
from Arabidopsis and rice. We examined the subcellular
localization of four BnWRKY proteins using green fluorescent protein (GFP). Subsequently, we studied the
responses of representative members of monophyletically
distinct WRKY clades to two fungal pathogens, as well as
five plant hormones, in order to gain further insights into
their roles in canola defense responses.

Results
Identification of 46 WRKY transcription factor genes in B.
napus
Although the complete sequence of the B. napus genome
has not yet been determined, the number of publicly
available ESTs was 593,895 as of May 30, 2008. It is well
known that gene discovery and genome characterization
through the generation of ESTs is one of the most widely
used methods [71]. A keyword search in NCBI "nr" dataset, returned only two previously annotated BnWRKY
sequences. We used BLAST alignments to search the
dbEST database and identified 343 unique GenBank EST
accessions from B. napus that showed significant similarity to the 72 AtWRKY genes and 36 other WRKY
sequences. We then used ESTpass to remove four chimerical ESTs and clustered the remaining 339 ESTs into 69
contigs and 66 singlets. For subsequent analyses, we also
identified the largest open reading frame of each of the
135 contigs or singlets using OrfPredictor [72,73]. We
also searched the DFCI oilseed rape gene index (BnGI,
release 3.1) and identified 70 tentative consensuses (TC)
and 79 singlets, which consisted of 314 ESTs. We found
that all 314 of the BnGI ESTs were present within the 339
dbESTs we extracted from Genbank. The differences in
numbers of WRKY ESTs from these databases can be
explained by the fact that the number of entries in these
databases are different, based on their release frequency.
The Shanghai database http://rapeseed.plantsignal.cn/,
[74]) is more recent, with a greater number of entries, and
produced an additional number of WRKY EST's that were
incorporated in the current study. We note that the EST
information available for canola is biased towards seed
coat and embryo tissues, which likely limited our ability
to identify a complete set of WRKY genes for this species.
As the contigs/singlets output from ESTpass were annotated based on their similarity to Arabidopsis WRKY genes,
we were able to identify the presumptive orthologs of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/68

respective canola WRKY genes. Therefore, we assigned
names to each BnWRKY (Additional file 1) based on the
name of the corresponding Arabidopsis WRKYs.
We noted that among all the BnWRKY genes we annotated, BnWRKY11 has the largest number (40) of ESTs,
followed by BnWRKY32 with a total of 26 ESTs, while
BnWRKY26, 30, 36, and 66 have only one EST each (Additional file 1 and additional file 2). To facilitate subsequent
phylogenetic, GFP fusion, and qRT-PCR analyses, we
designed primers based on the identified ESTs for each of
the 46 BnWRKY genes to obtain full length cDNA
sequences, at least for each of the coding regions, employing RT-PCR together with 3'RACE. As a result, we succeeded in cloning the cDNA sequences of 38 of these 46
BnWRKY genes, among which we identified two different
alleles (or possibly homeoalleles) for each of 13 BnWRKY
genes (Additional file 1). We were also able to identify
putative orthologs of these BnWRKY genes in both Arabidopsis and rice using the program InParanoid [75] (Additional file 1).
Although WRKY proteins have a conserved heptapeptide
WRKYGQK motif [11], many studies have reported slight
variations of the sequence for some WRKY proteins in Arabidopsis, rice, tobacco and barley [24,26,31,76]. Similarly,
a number of the BnWRKYs we identified have amino acid
sequence substitutions in their conserved WRKY signatures. For example, the following variations were noted:
WRKYGKK in BnWRKY50, and WRKYGRK in BnWRKY51
(Additional file 3). We also observed a 25 amino acid
insertion in the C-terminal WRKY domain of BnWRKY26,
compared to AtWRKY26 (Additional file 3). An examination of the cDNA sequence of Bn WRYKY26 revealed that
the insert starts with TT and ends with GG, suggesting that
it is most probably not an intron. Usually the nucleotide
sequence of the predominant class of introns begins with
GT ends with AG and that of a minor class begins with AT
and ends with AC [77,78], neither of which are true in this
particular instance. Our results thus suggest that
BnWRKY26 has diverged considerably during the evolutionary process.
Phylogenetic analysis of BnWRKY proteins
From the 46 canola WRKY genes identified, we were able
to extract 53 WRKY domains that were each approximately 60 amino acids in length. In 11 BnWRKY TF proteins, we identified two separate WRKY domains
(Additional file 3), and both N- and C-terminal WRKY
domains of these proteins were included in the phylogenetic analysis. The WRKY domain amino acid sequences
were aligned with each other (Additional file 3) and a
consensus maximum parsimony (MP) tree was inferred
(Figure 1). Subsequently, we reconstructed a rooted MP
tree using a WRKY protein from the world's smallest uni-

amino acid sequences from WRKY domains only. Only the ~60 amino acid residues in the WRKY domain were aligned using
ClustalX (v1.83) and were further examined manually for optimal alignment. The parsimony tree was drawn using MEGA4. The

nature of BnWRKY TFs, which is consistent with previous
studies [22,23,26].

We next classified the BnWRKY TFs we identified into
three major groups using criteria that had been previously
described for this family [11]. Accordingly, the Group II
proteins were further divided into five subgroups. From
our study, at least two representatives for each subgroup

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/68

of WRKY proteins were identified in the canola genome
(Figure 1). For example, twelve BnWRKYs (BnWRKY1, 2,
3, 4, 19, 20, 25, 26, 32, 33, 34 and 44) code for proteins
with two WRKY domains and clearly cluster with Group I
of the AtWRKYs. The N- and C-terminal domains of these
twelve BnWRKY form two different clusters named Group
IN and Group IC (Figure 1). The 28 identified Group II
WRKY members of canola were distributed unevenly
among the five subgroups (subgroups IIa-e, Figure 1) and
this is in agreement with previous studies in Arabidopsis,
rice and barley [11,26,31]. Two BnWRKYs (BnWRKY18,
40) formed a distinct subclade, IIa, similar to the observations in A. thaliana [11]. Five canola WRKYs (BnWRKY6,
31, 36, 42, 72) belong to Group IIb; eight (BnWRKY8, 24,
28, 45, 50, 51, 56, 75) belong to Group IIc; seven
(BnWRKY7, 11, 15, 17, 21, 39, 74) belong to Group IId;
and six canola WRKY (BnWRKY22, 27, 29, 35, 65, 69)
belong to Group IIe. Group III is represented by four single WRKY domain canola proteins (BnWRKY46, 53, 66
and 70). The comparison of number of WRKY genes in
Arabidopsis (AtWRKY), rice (OsWRKY), barley (HvWRKY)
and canola (BnWRKY) within each of the WRKY group/
subgroups (Table 1) showed that about 53â59% of the
expected WRKY genes of canola have been identified. It
appears that within group IId, the same number of WRKY
genes from A. thaliana and canola have been identified
whereas for other subgroups, additional BnWRKY genes
remain to be identified (Table 1). Our observations are
similar to the study on the barley WRKY gene family in
which approximately 50% of the expected HvWRKY genes
were identified [26].
To further explore the phylogenetic relationships between
WRKYs from canola and other species, we generated a
phylogenetic tree incorporating all the WRKYs we identified from Arabidopsis, rice, and canola (Additional file 4;
[27]). These results are consistent with our proposed classification of the newly characterized WRKYs from canola.

According to a) Eulgem et al. [11], b) Xie et al. [31], Ross et al., [27],
and c) Mangelsen et al. [26].

However, in rice, there are four major groups of WRKYs, I,
II, III and IV [27,31] and it can be observed that some
members of the rice WRKY family are scattered throughout the phylogenetic tree, an observation that has also
been made previously [27,31]. For example, OsWRKY57
(a group II WRKY) is clustered with those from group I-N
and OsWRKY61 (a group Ib WRKY) is clustered with
those of group III members (Additional file 4). Similarly,
OsWRKY 9 and 83 (group Ia WRKYs) are clustered with
group II members (groups IIb and d, respectively; Additional file 4). The three group IVa WRKYs (OsWRKY52,
56, and 58; Additional file 4) are scattered within
branches of group II and III. Interestingly, we observed
that OsWRKY86 (a group I member) is clustered with
group III instead of group II as previously reported by others [27] and, OsWRKY84 is clustered within group III in
our study, contrary to a previous report of this WRKY
being clustered within group I ([38]; additional file 4).
These discrepancies may be due to the use of different
algorithms (neighbor-joining versus MP) to generate the
phylogenetic trees.
Nuclear localization of four BnWRKY proteins
The function of a TF normally requires that it is localized
in the nucleus, although TFs targeting chloroplasts, mitochondria, or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have also been
identified [79]. To confirm that the BnWRKY TFs we identified are indeed targeted to the nucleus, we selected four
BnWRKY genes based on their known functions in mediating defense responses in Arabidopsis [25,45,80-82] for
analysis in vivo. We fused the coding regions of BnWRKY6,
25, 33, and 75 to the N-terminus of synthetic green fluorescent protein (sGFP) [83] and expressed them in Arabidopsis under the control of the constitutive cauliflower
mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. Analysis of conceptually translated BnWRKY6, 25, and 33 coding sequences
revealed the presence of a monopartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) (prediction program of protein localization sites, http://psort.nibb.ac.jp), however, no NLS was
detected in the translated BnWRKY75 sequence. We analyzed transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings harboring the
respective four constructs. In all four cases, green fluorescent signals were observed only in the nucleus (Figure 2Aâ
D). With the control vector alone, GFP signals were distributed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Figure 2E).
Our results indicate that BnWRKY6, 25, 33, and 75 are
indeed nuclear-localized proteins, which is consistent
with their predicted function as transcription factors.
Expression analysis of BnWRKY genes in response to
fungal pathogens-S. sclerotiorum and A. brassicae
Because the divergence of paralogous genes is often after
the sub-functionalization [84], we employed qRT-PCR to
investigate the responses of representatives of each of the
three major WRKY clades. We selected 16 BnWRKY genes,

WRKY1, 6, 11, 18, 20, 25, 28, 32, 33, 40, 45, 53, 65, 69,
70 and 75, as representatives of each clade (Additional file
1, Figure 1). After challenge with the fungal pathogen S.
sclerotiorum, transcript abundance of 13 BnWRKY genes
was observed to be significantly (t-test, P < 0.05) modulated with 10 being increased, two being decreased and
one being decreased at 12 h but subsequently increased at
72 h (Figure 3A). BnWRKY6, 25, 28, 33, 40, 45, 53,65, 69
and75 were highly induced at 48 h after the inoculation.
However, BnWRKY20 and 32 were repressed by S. sclerotiorum infection. BnWRKY1 was observed to be repressed at
an earlier time point (12 h) but induced later (72 h, Figure
3A).
We then examined the changes in transcript abundance of
these 16 BnWRKY genes in response to a second fungal
pathogen, A. brassicae, which is also a necrotrophic pathogen. The symptom development in these two pathosystems (S. sclerotiorum and A. brassicae) is different with
respect to time required, with A. brassicae requiring a
much longer period before visible disease symptoms
could be observed (data not shown). Accordingly, the
transcript abundance of only four BnWRKY genes were
significantly affected by A. brassicae with two (BnWRKY33
and 75) being significantly increased at 48 h post-pathogen challenge and two (BnWRKY70 at both 48 and 72 h
and BnWRKY69 only at 72 h) with decreased transcript
abundance (Figure 3B). In summary, our results indicate
that BnWRKY33 and 75 are induced by both S. sclerotiorum and A. brassicae with BnWRKY75 exhibiting a similar
temporal pattern of changes in transcript abundance
between the two fungi. However, BnWRKY69 and 70 had
different responses to S. sclerotiorum and A. brassicae. Our
results suggest that although both pathogens investigated
in this study are necrotrophic, they elicit slightly different
responses with respect to changes in transcript abundance
of BnWRKY genes.
Response of selected BnWRKY genes to hormone
treatments
To investigate the hormonal control mechanisms underlying BnWRKY gene expression, we treated canola plants
with five phytohormones, JA, SA, ABA, BAP and ET and
analyzed the changes in transcript abundance of these 16
BnWRKY genes using qRT-PCR. To ensure that the hormone applications were eliciting expected responses in
plants, we first examined the responses of a few additional
canola genes that are proposed to be orthologs of Arabidopsis genes previously reported to respond to these hormones. These Arabidopsis genes were two bZIP
transcription factors, TGA5, TGA6 for SA [85-87]; allene
oxide cyclase (AOC) [88] and plant defensin 1.2 (PDF1.2)
for JA [50]; ethylene insensitive 2 (EIN2) [89] and ethylene responsive factor (ERF2 and ERF4) [90] for ET; ABA
insensitive 5 (ABI5) [91-93] for ABA, and Arabidopsis

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/68

response regulator 6 (ARR6) [94] and cytokinin response
1 (CRE) [95] for BAP. We observed that the abundance of
transcripts for all of these genes was significantly
increased in response to the hormone treatments (data
not shown), confirming the efficacy of our hormone treatments.
Our results demonstrated that among the 16 BnWRKY
genes studied, BnWRKY40, 69 and 75 were induced by ET
and BnWRKY53 was repressed by ABA at 6 h (Figure 4A,
Table 2). In contrast, BnWRKY25, 32, 45, 69 and 70 were
repressed by BAP at 6 h (Figure 4A, Table 2). At 24 h,
BnWRKY1, 28, 32, 33, 45, and 75 were specifically
induced by ET and BnWRKY70 was repressed by ET (Figure 4B, Table 2). Three BnWRKY genes exhibited modulation of expression in response to two hormones (Table 2).
At 6 h, both JA and ET repressed BnWRKY11 and both ET
and BAP repressed BnWRKY1, 20 and32 (Figure 4C, Table
2). However, none of the genes were observed to be
affected by the two hormones at 24 h. In addition, both
ABA and BAP repressed BnWRKY69 (Figure 4C, Table 2).
None of these BnWRKY genes were affected by three or
more hormones (Table 2).
As indicated earlier, JA and SA are important signaling
molecules which are implicated in plant defense
responses [96,97]; and other phytohormones, through
their effect on SA or JA signaling, may influence disease
outcomes [98]. BnWRKY11 was observed to be repressed
by JA at 6 h although no significant change was observed
at 24 h (Table 2). In response to SA treatment, we
observed that the transcript abundance for seven genes
(BnWRKY6, 18, 33, 40, 53, 70 and 75) exhibited modulation at 6 h and three (BnWRKY53, 70 and 75) at 24 h
(Table 2), however, these observed changes were not statistically significant.
In summary, SA did not significantly affect the transcript
abundance of any of the BnWRKYs tested, whereas ET,
ABA, JA and the cytokinin BAP did affect the transcript
abundance of various BnWRKY genes investigated in this
study (Table 2). Although the 16 genes tested did not
show significant changes in expression levels after exogenous treatments with SA, there is the possibility that other
BnWRKY genes may be responsive to SA.

Discussion
In this study, we describe the identification and annotation of cDNA sequences of 46 members of the WRKY gene
family in canola and their classification into groups I to III
(Figure 1, Additional file 1). Among the 46 BnWRKY
genes identified, both the hallmark WRKYGQK motif
(43) and its variants (two variants, WRKYGKK for
BnWRKY50 and WRKYGRK for BnWRKY51) were identified in the translated amino acid sequences while that of

BnWRKY10 waits to be identified (Additional file 3). A
recent study demonstrated that AtWRKY TFs bearing the
WRKYGQK motif exhibit binding site preferences, which
are partly dependent on the adjacent DNA sequences outside of the TTGACY-core motif [20]. For those WRKY TFs
that do not contain the canonical WRKYGQK motif, a
binding sequence other than the W-box element ((C/
T)TGAC(C/T)) may exist. For instance, the binding
sequence of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) NtWRKY12 with
a WRKYGKK motif is TTTTCCAC, which deviates significantly from W-box [76]. Moreover, soybean (Glycine max)
GmWRKY6 and GmWRKY21 lose the ability to bind to a
W-box containing the variant WRKYGKK motif [66]. It
seems likely that the BnWRKY TFs that lack the canonical
WRKYGQK motif might not be able to interact with Wbox and therefore may have different target genes and possibly divergent roles, a proposal that must be verified in
future studies. Finally, mutation of amino acid Q to K of
AtWRKY1 was observed to affect binding activity with the

consensus W-box [99]. Furthermore, the second characteristic feature of WRKY proteins is a unique zinc-finger
motif C-X4â5-C-X22â23-H-X-H [11]. Of the 53 BnWRKY
domains, most of them contain this unique zinc-finger
motif while BnWRKY46, 53 and 70 (group III) have an
extended zinc-finger motif which is C-X7-C-X23-H-X-C.
This observation is consistent with previous study in Arabidopsis [11], barley [26] and rice [100].
Complete or partial WRKY domains are found in ESTs
from many species of land plants [24]. Recently, 37 WRKY
genes were identified in the moss, Physcomitrella patens
[101]. So far, no WRKY genes have been identified in the
archaea, eubacteria, fungi, or animal lineages [24]. However, in the genomes of the protist, Giardia lamblia and the
slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum, a single WRKY gene
with two WRKY domains were recently identified [23,24].
Further examination of the two WRKY domains existing
in the two organisms indicates that G. lamblia WRKY TF

BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:68

has a WRKYGSK heptapeptide at its N-terminal and a
WKKYGHK at its C-terminal, whereas in D. discoideum,
both WRKY domains have a classical WRKYGQK heptapeptide [24,101]. This suggests an ancient origin of the
canonical WRKYGQK heptapeptide and its variants. In the
green algae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a WRKY TF containing two WRKY domains (Acc. XM_001692290) was
also identified [24,101]. In the genome of the recently
sequenced, world's smallest free-living eukaryote, the unicellular chlorophytic algae, Ostreococcus tauri, a WRKY
gene containing a single WRKY domain and a WRKYGCK
heptapeptide is also present (Acc. CAL54953).
The identification of WRKY genes in primitive eukaryotes
suggests an ancient origin of the WRKY family, and this
family had emerged before the evolution and diversification of the plant phyla [24]. During the long evolutionary
history, the WRKY gene family greatly expanded, as demonstrated by the increased numbers of WRKY genes in
higher plants [101], and this expansion may be primarily
due to segmental duplications of genomic fragments as a
result of independent polyploidy events [24,102-104].
Comparison of a genomic region harboring five genes,
one of which is WRKY10, between tomato, Arabidopsis
and Capsella rubella, has revealed a great degree of
microsynteny between closely and distantly related dicotyledonous species [105]. In addition, AtWRKY10, with
one WRKY domain, is clustered within group I AtWRKYs
possessing two-domains [11]. The ortholog of AtWRKY10
in tomato or rice (OsWRKY35, Os04g39570) contains
two WRKY domains, which may suggest that during evolution, the N-terminal domain has been lost and the
occurrence of the loss of the N-terminal WRKY domain of
AtWRKY10 is after the divergence of monocots and dicots
[27,105].
An overall genomic duplication event has been identified
to exist in the tribe Brassiceae after a comparative genomic
analysis, and many genomic units that are conserved
between canola and Arabidopsis have also been identified
[106-108]. We observed Brassicaeceae-specific clades and
rice-specific clades based on our current analysis. In group
III, Arabidopsis WRKY domains (six AtWRKYs) form Brassicaeceae-specific clade while rice WRKY domains (23
OsWRKYs) also form rice-specific clade (Additional file
4). Similar to that observed by [26], some monocot-specific clades were observed in groups IIc and III WRKY
domains of rice and barley. This further supports the conclusion by Mangelsen et al. [26] about the occurrence of
this diversification after the divergence of mono- and dicotyledonous plants. Possibly more Brassicaeceae-specific
WRKY clades could be indentified from future phylogenetic analysis after the whole genome of canola has been
determined. A further comparative genomic analysis of
the WRKY-containing regions between canola and Arabi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/68

dopsis should enable us to reveal the extent of microcolinearity between these closely related species and a better
understanding of the expansion of the WRKY gene family
in canola.
WRKY TFs are involved in the regulation of various biological processes, including pathogen responses and hormone signaling [109]. A previous expression analysis of
AtWRKY genes demonstrated that nearly 70% are differentially expressed by pathogen infection or SA treatment,
suggesting important roles for WRKY in defense responses
[42]. Recently, two studies of the rice WRKY genes also
demonstrated that many are responsive to JA, SA and ABA
treatments [37,38]. Increased transcript abundance of SAand JA-responsive genes is essential for the induced resistance conferred by the two signaling pathways
[97,110,111]. WRKY TFs are also reported to participate
in disease resistance in Arabidopsis and tobacco through
modulation of SA- or JA-responsive gene expression similar to that induced by the TGA class of basic leucine-zipper
transcription factors [39,40,45,81,112].
Previous studies from our laboratory as well as those of
others revealed that few genes related to SA-signaling were
modulated by infection of canola with S. sclerotiorum
[2,5], suggesting that SA does not play a crucial role in
mediating responses of canola to this pathogen. The
responses of Arabidopsis to A. brassicicola, which causes
black spot in canola as A. brassicae does, also appear to be
mediated through JA instead of SA [113], which is similar
to responses to other necrotrophic fungi, including
Pythium species [80,114]. Hence, it is possible that WRKY
TFs may play an important role in suppressing the
involvement of SA in response to those pathogens. This
suggestion is consistent with the conclusion that
AtWRKY33, which is induced by many pathogens, acts as
a positive regulator of JA- and ET-mediated defense signaling but as a negative regulator of SA-mediated responses
[45]. As mentioned earlier, both A. brassicae as well as S.
sclerotiorum are able to induce BnWRKY33, one of the
genes belonging to group I. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that pathogen-induced AtWRKY33 expression
does not require SA signaling [80]. Similar to AtWRKY33,
AtWRKY25 acts as a negative regulator of the SA-mediated
signaling pathway [25]. The increased abundance of
BnWRKY25 due to the infection by S. sclerotiorum, but not
in the case of A. brassicae challenge, also suggests that it
might also work as a negative regulator of SA-related signaling pathways in the canola-S. sclerotiorum pathosystem,
but not in the canola-A. brassicae pathosystem. Of the
other group I members investigated in our study,
(BnWRKY1, 20 and 32), BnWRKY1 was observed to be significantly induced by S. sclerotiorum only at 72 h (Figure
3), and BnWRKY20 and 32 were repressed by S. sclerotiorum (Figure 3), indicating the differences in behavior of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/68

group I BnWRKYs in response to fungal pathogens (S. sclerotiorum and A. brassicae).
It is possible that several BnWRKY TFs may also be
involved in signaling the responses of canola to the pathogens S. sclerotiorum and A. brassicae. For instance, group
IIa members have been demonstrated to play both positive and negative roles in plant defense [112,115-117].
The transcript levels of two genes of the group IIa:
BnWRKY18, and 40, orthologs of which are known to act
as negative regulators of plant defense in Arabidopsis [95],
were observed to increase in response to S. sclerotiorum
and A. brassicae challenge. For A. brassicae, the differences
in transcript abundance between controls and inoculated
plants were not statistically significant (Figure 3). In addition, it has been reported that AtWRKY6, one member of
the group IIb, acts as a positive regulator of the senescence- and pathogen defense-associated PR1 promoter
activity, and is also induced by SA and bacterial infection
[114]. Since leaf senescence is often linked to plant
defense [118], the induction of BnWRKY6 by S. sclerotiorum, ABA and SA at an early time-point (6 h) but not A.
brassicae, may suggest a role in leaf senescence, which is
observed very early in the S. sclerotiorum-canola pathosystem (Figure 5).
We also observed that group IIc (BnWRKY28,45) and III
(BnWRKY75) BnWRKYs in our study were all induced by
the infection of S. sclerotiorum and ET whereas BnWRKY75
was induced only by A. brassicae (Figure 3, Table 2).
Changes in expression of BnWRKY75 induced by both
pathogens suggest that an ET-mediated signaling pathway
may be involved in mediating the responses of canola to
necrotrophic pathogens. In Arabidopsis growing in 1/2 Ã
MS liquid media supplemented with 10 Î¼M of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC), it has been previously
observed that AtWRKY45 and AtWRKY75 were induced;
while AtWRKY28 was repressed compared to untreated
controls [119]. This differences between the expression of
AtWRKY28 [116] and BnWRKY28 (this study) in response
to ET treatment may be the result of subtle differences in
experiments including the use of different tissues (seedlings versus leaves), and/or the ethylene-generating reagents (ACC versus ET) used. Further studies on the role of
these three BnWRKY TFs in mediating defense responses
are ongoing in our laboratory.
Although BnWRKY11 (Group IId) was not affected by
either S. sclerotiorum or A. brassicae in this study, our previous microarray profiling of transcriptome changes in
canola as a result of S. sclerotiorum infection revealed that
transcript levels of BnWRKY11 and 15 increased while
that of BnWRKY17 decreased at specific time points,
although the magnitude of response was less than twofold [5]. Arabidopsis AtWRKY11 and AtWRKY17 are both

Hypothetical model of WRKY network in mediating
canola responses to S. sclerotiorum and phytohormones. JA/ET-responsive, but not SA-responsive genes
were observed in the necrotrophic pathogen S. sclerotiorumcanola interaction [2,5], and these induced BnWRKY genes,
such as BnWRKY25, 28, 33, 53 and 75, could potentially activate the downstream JA/ET signaling pathway or cell death.
Moreover, BnWRKY70 might also negatively regulate JA/ET
signaling pathway while BnWRKY6 possibly modulates the
expression of PR1 gene, culminating in cell death, which
would benefit the infection and growth of necrotrophic fungi
[114,118]. MPK3, one of mitogen-activated protein kinases,
was also observed to be induced by S. sclerotiorum in our previous microarray study [5], and MPK3 in Arabidopsis is a
positive regulator of AtWRKY22/29 [39]. Solid and dashed

regulation of the downstream genes.

known to act as negative defense regulators and WRKY11
appears to act upstream of JA [120] since it does not
respond to JA [119,121]. However, the expression of
AtWRKY11 has been reported to correlate with the induction of the JA biosynthesis enzymes AOS and LOX 2 h
after challenge with P. syringae [120]. Incidentally, the
accumulation of JA also occurs within the first hour of the
interaction with P. syringae [122]. Taken together with our
observations that BnWRKY11 was repressed by JA and ET
treatments at 6 h, and was not induced by the pathogens,
it is possible that the pathogen-induced accumulation of
JA might modulate the expression of BnWRKY11.
Given the recently emerging role for ABA in defense
responses [61-63], it is possible that ABA exerts some of
these effects through the modulation of BnWRKY genes,
specifically BnWRKY53 and BnWRKY69. Similarly, the
cytokinin BAP has been implicated in both alleviating and
exacerbating the hypersensitive response (HR), which is
characterized by tissue necrosis and is frequently accom-

BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:68

panied by the subsequent induction of systemic acquired
resistance (SAR) throughout the plant [123]. Furthermore, cytokinins can promote the susceptibility of biotrophs by inducing the necrotroph resistance pathway,
which is responsive to JA/ET [98]. As suggested for ABA
mediated plant defense responses, it is possible that the
BnWRKYs, which were observed to be modulated by exogenous BAP application, may be responsible, at least in
part, for mediating the observed effects with the necrotrophic pathogens.
Based on our previous and current studies, we propose a
model outlining the possible roles of BnWRKY TFs in
mediating the responses of canola to S. sclerotiorum and
phytohormones (Figure 5). Both S. sclerotiorum and JA/ET
can induce BnWRKY28, 33, and 75 at 24 h post inoculation and possibly activate the downstream JA/ET signaling
pathway at later time points (Figure 5). S. sclerotiorum specifically induces BnWRKY6, 25, and 53, and JA/ET specifically induce BnWRKY1 and 32 at 24 h post inoculation
(Figure 5). This may be explained by the more complicated molecular patterns generated by S. sclerotiorum during the infection compared to the application of JA or ET
only. BnWRKY70 in this study is also found to negatively
regulate JA/ET defense genes, and it is possibly positively
regulated by SA (Figure 5), which could lead to interference with the JA/ET signaling pathway. This is consistent
with previous report of AtWRKY70 being the node of convergence of JA and SA signaling [55]. It is also possible
that BnWRKY6 modulates the expression of PR1 gene, culminating in cell death (Figure 5), which is conducive for
the growth of necrotrophic fungi [114,118], a hypothesis
that must be tested in the future. A mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) gene, MPK3, was also observed to be
induced at 24 h and 48 h post inoculation in our previous
study [5]. MPK3 in Arabidopsis has been demonstrated to
positively regulate AtWRKY22/29 [39], (Figure 5). Similar
to AtWRKY25 and 33, BnWRKY25 and 33, may act as a
positive regulators of JA- and ET-mediated defense signaling pathways and as negative regulators of the SA-mediated signaling pathway [25,45] (Figure 5). Further work
needs to be performed to characterize orthologs of
AtWRKY22 and 29 in canola, and to examine the relationship between MAPK signaling cascade and BnWRKYs.
Moreover, a detailed functional characterization of
BnWRKY TFs, using a variety of reverse genetic techniques,
in the context of S. sclerotiorum response, will help to better delineate their physiological roles.
As discussed above for B. napus-S. sclerotiorum pathosystem and function of related AtWRKY gene, several WRKY
factors act as negative regulators of plant defense whereas
others positively modulate this response implying their
association with distinct regulatory complexes. Functional
redundancy in defense programs is an inherent feature of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/68

WRKY genes [109] and it may reflect a strong need to
backup essential regulatory functions [22]. Still, we can
expect exciting novel revelations about WRKY TFs in the
very near future on the basis of the enormous progress
made within the past two years.

Conclusion
In summary, we identified 46 BnWRKY TFs based on the
publicly available EST resources of canola and cloned the
cDNA sequences for 38 of them. We characterized the
responses of 16 selected genes, based on their phylogenetic relationship in response to two fungal pathogens
and five hormone treatments. Based on our data, we propose that BnWRKY TFs might play an important role in
plant defense response, possibly by acting as positive or
negative regulators of plant defense, and canola may
respond differently to S. sclerotiorum and A. brassicae from
BnWRKY mediated plant defense system. Our results also
confirm that there is cross-talk between biotic stress and
hormone signaling. Functional redundancy in defense
programs is an inherent feature of WRKY genes [109] and
future studies will be directed towards delineating the specific roles of individual WRKY TFs in those and related
pathosystems in order to explore the possibility that
manipulation of abundance of one or several of these proteins may lead to durable and robust resistance to the
pathogen, apart from contributing to our understanding
of the molecular processes that occur during host-pathogen interactions.

Methods
BnWRKY gene identification
Thirty-six WRKY domain sequences (WRKY-seed) downloaded
from
Pfam
http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/fam
ily?acc=PF03106 were used to search the dbEST http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/index.html
datasets
(release 053008) for WRKY genes in B. napus (oilseed rape
and canola) using the tBlastn program. The significant
hits (E < 1e-4) were retrieved and Microsoft Excel 2003
was then used to obtain unique sequences based on the
GenBank Accession numbers. 177 unique ESTs were
retrieved and organized into a FASTA format file before
input into ESTpass program [124] for cleansing, clustering, and assembling of the unique ESTs. To confirm that
the obtained contigs and singlets encode WRKY proteins,
the nucleotide sequences were translated in six possible
reading frames using OrfPredictor into amino acid
sequences, which were then examined for the existence of
the heptapeptide WRKYGQK and its variants. The resulting 36 contigs and 38 singlets were used as query
sequences in a BLASTn search against B. napus EST dataset
in NCBI dbEST and Shanghai RAPESEED database (http:/
/rapeseed.plantsignal.cn/, [74]) in order to obtain maximum sequence length for each BnWRKY, and 339 unique
ESTs were retrieved. We also used a key word search of

Page 13 of 19

BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:68

WRKY genes in B. napus in the non-redundant (nr) database of NCBI and obtained two cDNA sequences (GenBank Acc. DQ539648 and DQ209287), which were
annotated to be BnWRKY40. Altogether we obtained 341
unique sequences based on the accession numbers. We
then used the ESTpass program for cleansing, clustering,
and assembling of the unique ESTs. The resultant contigs
and singletons were then used as query sequences in a
Blastn search against Arabidopsis to find the best hit (putative orthologs) among the 72 AtWRKY genes. Afterwards,
the putative transcripts were analyzed using OrfPredictor
to predict open reading frames (ORFs) and obtain the
translated amino acid sequences. The amino acid
sequence of the largest ORF for each putative transcript
was filtered out and entered into the SMART program
http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/smart/
set_mode.cgi?NORMAL=1 to predict the WRKY domain.
In case of the absence of the characteristic features of the
WRKY domain for a particular transcript, it was translated
in six possible reading frames in DNAMAN (V4.0, Lynnon
BioSoft) and manually checked to output the amino acid
sequences. At this step, we obtained 46 unique BnWRKY
genes and identified those BnWRKY genes that contain
incomplete or no WRKY domain and therefore we used
RT-PCR together with 3'RACE to extend the WRKY
domain sequences.
Plant growth and gene cloning
Wild type canola (Westar) plants were grown in Sunshine
soil mix 4 (Sungro, Vancouver, BC, Canada) in the greenhouse with a photoperiod of 16 h light (combination of
natural light and T5 fluorescent tubes with a light intensity of approximately 200 Î¼E m-2 s-1)/8 h dark, and a temperature of 21Â°C day/18Â°C night for 18 days. Young
leaves were harvested for RNA isolation using the RNeasy
Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada). RNA
integrity was checked by electrophoresis on a formaldehyde agarose gel and quantified using the NanoDrop
1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Wilmington, DE,
USA). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 Î¼g of
total RNA using Superscript II (Invitrogen, Burlington,
ON, Canada) and Oligo(dT)18 primers (Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada). PCR primers were designed using
PrimerSelect (DNAStar Inc.) or Primer 3 (v0.4.0, http://
frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3_www.cgi and
are listed in additional file 5. PCR was conducted in a 50Î¼L final volume including 0.5 Î¼L of cDNA template, 1Ã
Pfx buffer, 200 Î¼M deoxynucleotide triphosphates
(dNTPs) (Fermentas), 400 nM of each primer, and 2 units
of Platinum Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen). The PCR conditions included an initial denaturation at 94Â°C for 2 min,
followed by 35 cycles of 94Â°C for 30 s, 50Â°C for 30 s,
68Â°C for 1 min per kb, with a final extension at 68Â°C for
5 min. PCR products were gel purified using the QIAquick
gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and cloned into pJET1.2 vector

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/68

supplied with the CloneJET PCR cloning kit (Fermentas)
and sequenced from the two ends using BigDye reagent
on an ABI3700 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster
city, CA, USA).
For rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3'RACE), firststrand cDNA was made from 2 Î¼g of total RNA extracted
from wild-type canola (cv. Westar) using Superscript II
and an oligo(dT)17 adaptor sequence [125], and 0.5 Î¼L of
cDNA template was used for 3' RACE. Reactions were conducted in a 50-Î¼L final volume including 1Ã Taq buffer,
0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.4 Î¼M of each primer, and 0.2 Î¼L (1 unit)
of Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The primers
designed by PrimerSelect (DNAstar) are outlined in the
additional file 5 and the adaptor sequence was 5'-GACTCGAGCGACATCGAT-3' [125]. The PCR conditions
included an initial denaturation of 94Â°C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94Â°C for 30 s, 50Â°C for 30 s, 72Â°C
for 1 min, with a final extension at 72Â°C for 5 min. PCR
products were purified and cloned into pGEM-T vector
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) or pJET1.2 vector (Fermentas) and sequenced. Sequences were analyzed and translated using DNAStar. Based on the sequenced cDNA
sequences from 3'RACE, new primers were designed,
which were then used to clone the full-length cDNAs of
some BnWRKY genes. At least two independent clones
were sequenced from both ends.
Phylogenetic tree construction and bioinformatics
The WRKY domain boundary was defined as previously
described [11]. The peptide sequences of the domains
were aligned using ClustalX (v1.83) with a gap opening
penalty of 35 and gap extension penalty of 0.75 in pairwise alignment, and a gap opening penalty of 15 and gap
extension penalty of 0.30 in multiple alignment parameters settings. The multiple alignments were adjusted with
gaps manually inserted for optimal alignment based on
the conserved features of the WRKY domains. The maximum parsimony algorithm implemented in MEGA4
[126] for amino acid sequences were used for phylogenetic tree reconstruction according to [127,128]. One
hundred bootstrapped data sets were used to estimate the
confidence of each tree clade. The protein sequences of
Arabidopsis WRKY TFs were retrieved from TAIR http://
www.arabidopsis.org and rice WRKY TFs from the Database of Rice Transcription Factors (DRTF, http://
drtf.cbi.pku.edu.cn/). The nomenclature of rice (Oryza
sativa. cv japonica) WRKY TFs was as previously described
[27]. Putative orthologs of BnWRKY genes were identified
in both Arabidopsis and rice using the translated amino
acid sequences in InParanoid [75].
Subcellular localization and confocal microscopy
The coding regions (CDS) of BnWRKY6, BnWRKY25,
BnWRKY33, and BnWRKY75 were amplified by RT-PCR

Page 14 of 19

BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:68

from canola (Westar) cDNAs using the primers listed in
additional file 5. PCR products were purified using a
QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), restricted by Nco
I (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and/or Bsp HI
(Fermentas), purified again and cloned into Nco I digested
pCsGFPBT (GenBank: DQ370426) vector with a Gly-Alarich peptide linker between CDSs and sGFP. All constructs
were sequenced and mobilized into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 through the freeze-thaw method and transformed into wild-type A. thaliana (Col-0) employing the
floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998). Resistant
lines were selected on 1/2 Ã MS containing 1% (w/v)
sucrose and 50 mg/L hygromycin B (Sigma-Aldrich) for 7
d before being transferred into soil to grow the plants to
maturity and to harvest T2 seeds, which were further sown
on the same type of hygromycin-containing medium.
Five-day-old seedlings from ten independent T2 lines were
mounted on slides for GFP observation under confocal
microscope (Carl Zeiss). At least five cells were screened
for each line.
Fungal pathogen inoculation and hormone treatments
Wild type canola (cv. Westar) plants were grown as
described previously in a greenhouse for 18 days. Potato
dextrose agar (PDA) agar plugs of S. sclerotiorum were prepared as described earlier [5] and placed on the first and
second true leaves, which were wounded slightly. The
preparation of spores of A. brassicae and inoculation of
canola leaves were performed as described previously [4].
Leaves of uninoculated/mock plants were treated similarly with PDA agar plugs without the mycelia or with
water in the case of A. brassicae. Plants were placed in a
humidity chamber for 24 h before being placed in the
greenhouse. Tissues were harvested 12, 24, 48 and 72 h
post inoculation and kept at -80Â°C after being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. JA, SA, BAP and ABA were applied
by spraying 50 Î¼M JA, 1 mM SA, 20 Î¼M BAP or 50 Î¼M (Â±)ABA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). A stock solution (500 Î¼M) of JA in water was first prepared and then
diluted with 0.1% (v/v) ethanol to 50 Î¼M. ABA was first
dissolved in absolute ethanol to prepare a 20 mM stock
solution and then diluted with 0.1% (v/v) ethanol to the
final 50 Î¼M solution. SA was dissolved in water to prepare
a 100 mM stock solution with the adjustment of pH to 6.5
using 1 M KOH before dilution in water to the 1 mM
working solution and BAP was dissolved in 1 M NaOH to
prepare a 1 mM stock solution after which it was diluted
with water to the 20 Î¼M working solution. The mock treatments were 0.1% (v/v) ethanol for JA and ABA, water
adjusted to pH 6.5 with 1 M KOH or 1 M NaOH for SA or
BAP treatments, respectively. Ethylene treatment was carried out in an airtight clear acrylic chamber (1.5 m Ã 0.6
m Ã 0.6 m) placed in the same greenhouse, into which
100 ppm ethylene gas in air (Praxair, Mississauga, ON,
Canada) was passed at a rate of 2 L/min. Mock plants were
placed in a separate chamber into which air (Praxair) was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/68

passed at the same rate. Leaves from mock and hormone
treated plants were harvested at 6 and 24 h time points,
flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80Â°C. The
entire sample preparation was independently repeated
three times.
Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated from mock, inoculated or hormone treated leaf tissue using the RNeasy Plant Mini kit
(Qiagen) with on-column DNA digestion. RNA was quantified by NanoDrop ND-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies,
Inc.) and the integrity of the RNA was assessed on a 1%
(w/v) agarose gel. Primers were designed using
PrimerExpress3.0 (Applied Biosystems) targeting an
amplicon size of 80â150 bp. The primers used are listed
in the additional file 5. The specificity of all primers
designed was submitted to BLASTn search against NCBI B.
napus nr and EST databases and any nonspecific primers
were eliminated or redesigned. Hence, the results from
qRT-PCR analysis might represent the response of specific
BnWRKY genes. The qRT-PCR assay was performed as
described previously [5]. qRT-PCR for each gene was performed in duplicate for each of the three independent biological replicates. Significance was determined with SAS
software version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc.) (p value < 0.05).
Accession numbers
The cDNA sequences of 38 BnWRKY TF genes cloned in this
study were deposited in public database [GenBank:

A bootstrap consensus maximum parsimony tree of WRKY TFs in canola, Arabidopsis and rice (japonica). Only the WRKY domain residues
were aligned using ClustalX (v1.83) and the evolutionary history was
inferred using the maximum parsimony method in MEAG4. The percentage of replicate trees is shown on the branches and it is calculated in the
bootstrap test (500 replicates) for the associated taxa being clustered
together. All alignment gaps were treated as missing data. There were a
total of 150 positions in the final dataset, out of which 66 were parsimony
informative. The two letters N and C after group I represents the N-terminal and the C-terminal WRKY domains of group I proteins, respectively.
A chlorophyte alga, Ostreococcus tauri (Ot) WRKY (Acc. CAL54953)
is used as the outgroup.
