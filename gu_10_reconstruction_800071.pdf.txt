Abstract
Background: Many Firmicutes bacteria, including solvent-producing clostridia such as Clostridium acetobutylicum, are
able to utilize xylose, an abundant carbon source in nature. Nevertheless, homology searches failed to recognize all the
genes for the complete xylose and xyloside utilization pathway in most of them. Moreover, the regulatory mechanisms
of xylose catabolism in many Firmicutes except Bacillus spp. still remained unclear.
Results: A comparative genomic approach was used to reconstruct the xylose and xyloside utilization pathway and
analyze its regulatory mechanisms in 24 genomes of the Firmicutes. A novel xylose isomerase that is not homologous
to previously characterized xylose isomerase, was identified in C. acetobutylicum and several other Clostridia species.
The candidate genes for the xylulokinase, xylose transporters, and the transcriptional regulator of xylose metabolism
(XylR), were unambiguously assigned in all of the analyzed species based on the analysis of conserved chromosomal
gene clustering and regulons. The predicted functions of these genes in C. acetobutylicum were experimentally
confirmed through a combination of genetic and biochemical techniques. XylR regulons were reconstructed by
identification and comparative analysis of XylR-binding sites upstream of xylose and xyloside utilization genes. A novel
XylR-binding DNA motif, which is exceptionally distinct from the DNA motif known for Bacillus XylR, was identified in
three Clostridiales species and experimentally validated in C. acetobutylicum by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay.
Conclusions: This study provided comprehensive insights to the xylose catabolism and its regulation in diverse
Firmicutes bacteria especially Clostridia species, and paved ways for improving xylose utilization capability in C.
acetobutylicum by genetic engineering in the future.
Background
The Firmicutes (Bacilli/Clostridia) are a diverse group of
Gram-positive bacteria that includes a large number of
species that produce lactic acid, acetone, butanol, and
ethanol through fermentation of a variety of carbon
sources. Many of these bacteria were originally isolated
from the plant environments such as garden soil, fruits,
and vegetables [1,2]. Among them, Clostridium acetobutylicum is one of the best-studied clostridia and was used
to develop an industrial fermentation process for producing solvents [3,4]. This strain is known to utilize a broad

range of monosaccharides, disaccharides, starches, and
other substrates such as whey and xylan [5,6].
Xylan and xyloglucan, the major hemicellulose components of plant cell walls, are two of the most abundant
polysaccharides in nature and play an important role in
supplying carbon and energy to a variety of organisms
[7,8]. Depolymerization of xylan and xyloglucan produces β- and α-xylosides, respectively, that are transported into the cell and further degraded into D-xylose
[9]. D-Xylose is finally transformed to the common metabolic intermediate xylulose 5-phosphate. Genetics and
regulation of the xylanolytic machinery have been studied in some model species of Bacilli class, such as Bacillus
subtilis [10] and Lactococcus lactis [11], but so far not in
Clostridia.
In bacteria, the transformation of D-xylose to xylulose
5-P is catalyzed via consecutive isomerization to D-xylulose and phosphorylation reactions (Figure 1). This two-

pathway in Firmicutes. Functional roles present in C. acetobutylicum
and B. subtilis are shown on green and yellow backgrounds, respectively. Those present in other bacteria of the same lineage (but not in C. acetobutylicum and B. subtilis) are shown on a gray background.

step biochemical pathway appears to be conserved in
both non-xylanolytic bacteria (such as Escherichia coli)
and xylanolytic bacteria such as B. subtilis [12,13]. In B.
subtilis, the genes involved in the xylose and xyloside utilization pathway are clustered into two operons, xylAB
and xynTB (Figure 2). Their expression is negatively regulated at the transcriptional level by the regulator XylR
[14]. Due to the lack of a xylose uptake system, B. subtilis
is unable to grow with xylose as a sole carbon source [15].
Several Clostridium species have been shown to metabolize D-xylose by early studies and our preliminary analysis [16,17]. However, the initial genomic survey of C.
acetobutylicum ATCC 824 identified only the gene
encoding xylulokinase in the xylose pathway, whereas the
ortholog of the xylA gene encoding xylose isomerase was
not found [4]. Although several genes of xyloside metabolism are annotated in public databases (e.g. GenBank or
KEGG), some of these annotations are imprecise and
have not been consistently projected across all the
sequenced clostridia. Moreover, our current knowledge
of transcriptional regulation of xylose utilization pathway
in Gram-positive bacteria was limited to Bacillus spp.
This prompted us to perform a detailed analysis of xylose
utilization and its regulatory mechanisms in the species
of Bacilli and Clostridia classes by combining comparative genomic analyses with genetic and biochemical techniques.
In this study, we used a subsystems-based comparative
genomic analysis [18,19] to explore the xylose and xyloside utilization machinery in the Firmicutes species with
completely sequenced genomes. A novel xylose
isomerase (named XylA-II) that is not homologous to
previously characterized XylA, was identified in several
Clostridia species (e.g. CAC2610). In C. acetobutylicum

Page 2 of 14

the xylose utilization pathway also includes a xylulokinase (XylB, CAC2612), a xylose proton-symporter (XylT,
CAC1345), and a transcriptional regulator (XylR,
CAC3673). The predicted functions of these genes in C.
acetobutylicum were experimentally confirmed through a
combination of genetic and biochemical techniques. We
conclusively showed that the identified gene xylA-II
encodes a fully functional xylose isomerase that catalyze
the transformation of D-xylose to D-xylulose. In addition,
we have also tentatively identified several other genes
likely associated with the utilization of β- or α-xyloside.
Many of these genes occurred in operons that formed a
predicted regulon controlled by XylR. Comparative analysis of upstream regions of the xylose and xyloside utilization genes allowed identification of candidate DNA
motifs for various groups of XylR regulators and reconstruction of XylR regulons. A novel XylR-binding DNA
motif, which is exceptionally distinct from the DNA motif
known for Bacillus XylR, was identified in three Clostridiales species and experimentally validated in C. acetobutylicum by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay
(EMSA).

Results
(i) Comparative genomics of xylose and xyloside utilization
in Firmicutes

The subsystems-based approach was used to assess metabolic potential of Firmicutes species with completely
sequenced genomes in utilization of xylose and its oligomeric precursors. For the twenty-four species that possess the xylose pathway genes, we reconstructed the
xylose and xyloside utilization pathway and analyzed its
regulatory mechanisms. The detailed results of this analysis are captured in the SEED subsystem available on line
and in Additional file 1. The key results are illustrated in
Figure 3 and Table 1 and contain both previously known
and novel features predicted using the genome context
analysis. Some of these features are briefly highlighted
below where we focus mostly on novel findings and conjectures.
XylR regulon

The transcriptional factor XylR belongs to ROK (Repressor, Open reading frame, Kinase) protein family and has
an N-terminal DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal
sugar kinase-like domain [20]. Based on homology supported by chromosomal clustering with xylose pathway
genes, we identified XylR orthologs in most genomes of
Firmicutes (Figure 3 and Additional file 1). Although
XylR has been characterized in Bacillus spp. as a repressor of the xyl operon encoding xylose pathway genes [12],
the annotations of XylR homologs in public databases are
incomplete and imprecise due to the presence of functionally divergent paralogs and limited experimental data
on their characterization. For example, xylR is assigned to

regulator in this study, because it displayed a closest
homology with the characterized XylR from B. subtilis

ure 2B). The lowest pairwise sequence similarity between
different groups of XylR proteins was 21% (between XylR
from C. acetobutylicum and Leuconostoc mesenteroides).
XylR from C. acetobutylicum was in the same group with
orthologous proteins from C. beijerinckii, and A. metalliredigens. This group of clostridial XylR proteins stands
alone from XylR orthologs in other Clostridium such as
C. phytofermentans and C. difficile.
Although the XylR regulons in Bacilli/Clostridia have
been analyzed previously [21], a rapidly growing number
of complete genomes in these classes allowed significant
improvement of the accuracy of XylR-binding DNA
motifs and expansion of XylR regulons. Analysis of
upstream regions of XylR-controlled genes and their
orthologs in XylR-encoding genomes resulted in identifi-

cation of the group-specific XylR-binding DNA motifs
that were used to search for additional candidate
XylR-binding sites in the analyzed groups of genomes
(Figure 2C). The obtained consensus sequences for XylRbinding sites in the Bacillaceae genomes (groups 5, 6 and
7 on the XylR protein tree) were in accordance with that
experimentally determined for B. subtilis XylR [22]. Predicted DNA motifs of XylR regulators from other groups
on the tree were partially similar to that from the Bacillaceae. However, the group 1 of XylR regulators from C.
acetobutylicum, C. beijerinckii, and A. metalliredigens has
an exceptionally different DNA recognition motif, a 25bp inverted repeat with consensus sequence 5'-ACTTattAAAnnnnnTTTaaAAAgt-3' (Figure 2C).
The identified candidate DNA-binding sites of different
groups of XylR regulators were detected in the promoter

regions of most xylose utilization genes in Firmicutes
(Figure 3 and Additional file 2). The most conserved part
of the XylR regulon includes the xylose pathway genes
xylA and xylB and transporter genes xylFGH or xylT. The
XylR regulon members also include the genes involved in
uptake and degradation of α-, and β-xylosides. In addition, the presence of XylR-binding sites upstream of the
xylR gene in many species suggests possible autoregulation of its expression. Hence, assignment of the gene xylR
(e.g. CAC3673) is further supported by sharing upstream
XylR-binding sites with xylose pathway genes. Remarkably, a XylR-binding site in the C. acetobutylicum and several other Clostridium genomes was detected upstream
of a hypothetical gene encoding a novel non-orthologous
variant of xylose isomerase characterized in this work
(see below).
Orthologs of XylR regulator were not found in several
species of Firmicutes possessing a complete version of the
xylose utilization pathway, i.e., Moorella thermoacetica
and L. lactis. In the first species, a hypothetical LacI-type
transcriptional factor (Moth_2024) was inferred based on
chromosomal clustering with the xylose pathway genes
(Figure 3). The xylose operon in L. lactis is known to be
controlled by an AraC-type regulator (also called XylR)
[23]. Since there are only few genomes encoding these
two types of xylose regulator, their DNA recognition
motifs could not be determined accurately. Overall, alternative transcriptional regulators of xylose metabolism
appear to be present in various species of Firmicutes.
Xyloside uptake and degradation

The analysis of operons and regulons associated with
xylose and xyloside utilization subsystem allowed us to
accurately annotate and map some previously uncharacterized components of xyloside utilization machinery in
Firmicutes. Most genes encoding β- and α-xylosidases
(xynB and xylS, respectively) appear to be clustered on

the chromosome and/or co-regulated with the xylose
pathway genes (Figure 3).
Based on the genome context analysis, we predicted the
involvement of three types of transporters, XynT, XynABC,
and XynPTS, in the xyloside uptake (Figure 3). XynT
belongs to the MFS (Major Facilitator Superfamily) transporter family. The xynT gene was identified as a member
of the XylR regulon in C. acetobutylicum (CAC3451) and
several Lactobacillales and Bacillales (designated as xynP
in B. subtilis by [24]). It is also positionally clustered with
xylosidase and xylose pathway genes (Figure 3). An alternative system of xyloside transport via a committed ABC
cassette was predicted for Oceanobacillus iheyensis
(OB3123-OB3121) and several other species. The XynABC
transport system is homologous to an oligosaccharide
ABC transporter from the Streptococcus mutans (~24%
identity; [25]). The functional prediction is supported by
chromosomal clustering and by sharing upstream XylRbinding sites with xylosidase and other xyl genes (Figure
2A). A novel xyloside transporter from the phosphotransferase (PTS) system family was predicted for Enterococcus faecalis and C. difficile. The gene cluster encoding
this XynPTS system (e.g. CD3070-CD3067) is a candidate
member of the predicted XylR regulons and co-localized
with α-xylosidase gene (xylS) in both species (Figure 2A),
suggesting involvement of XynPTS in uptake of α-xyloside.
Xylose transport

The ABC-type xylose transporter XylFGH was originally
described in E. coli [26]. An orthologous xylose ABC
transporter was found in the genomic context of the
xylose utilization genes in several Clostridiales, Thermoanaerobacterales, and Bacillales species (e.g.
Cbei_2380-Cbei_2382 in C. beijerinckii; see Figure 3).
Another xylose transporter belonging to the MFS transporter family, XylT, was described in Bacillus megaterium

Gu et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:255
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/255

[27] and L. brevis [28]. Its orthologs in several species of
Bacilli/Clostridia have been annotated as xylose protonsymporter in the public databases (e.g. CAC1345 of C.
acetobutylicum). In this study XylT was tentatively identified in more species such as C. beijerinckii. This functional assignment is supported by the conserved colocalization on the chromosome and by predicted co-regulation (via upstream XylR-binding sites) with other xyl
genes (Figure 3).
Xylose pathway

Xylose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.5) is required for the first
reaction of xylose utilization, converting D-xylose into Dxylulose. This enzyme, a product of the xylA gene, was
characterized in detail in L. lactis [29], and its orthologs
are present in many bacteria including B. subtilis. However, analysis of the xylose utilization subsystem showed
that this gene is missing in C. acetobutylicum and Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus that have other components of the xylose utilization pathway. Based on genomic
and functional context analysis (Figure 3), we have tentatively identified a candidate gene for an alternative xylose
isomerase (termed here XylA-II), which is not homologous to XylA from B. subtilis and other Firmicutes (called
here as XylA-I). XylA-II belongs to the fucose isomerase
FucI family (PF02952), with a weak ~14% similarity to
FucI from E. coli [30]. The xylA-II gene in C. acetobutylicum (CAC2610) and C. beijerinckii (Cbei_2389) is clustered with xylB and preceded by candidate XylR-binding
sites (Figure 2A), whereas C. phytofermentans has a separate xylA-II gene preceded by a candidate XylR site.
Xylulokinase (EC 2.7.1.17), XylB, is required for the
phosphorylation of D-xylulose yielding D-xylulose 5-P, a
key intermediate in the pentose phosphate pathway of the
central carbon metabolism. XylB, originally characterized
in E. coli [26], is the invariant component of the xylose
pathway (Figure 3). However, accurate functional assignment of sugar kinase genes such as xylB is not easy due to
the presence of functionally divergent paralogs. For
example, both CAC2612 and CAC1344 in C. acetobutylicum genome are annotated as xylulokinase in GenBank
based on homology. Here only CAC2612 and its
orthologs were identified as XylB based on the genome
context evidence as follows: chromosomal clustering with
xylose utilization genes and assignment to the XylR regulon (Figure 3).
In summary, the subsystem reconstruction and the
genome context analysis in 24 genomes of Firmicutes
allowed us to predict the candidate genes for a novel
xylose isomerase and a xylulokinase as well as for previously uncharacterized xylose and xyloside transporters
and xylose regulator (Table 1). The regulon analysis led to
tentative identification of different types of DNA motifs
that correspond to the binding sites of transcriptional

performed experimental validation of the predicted functions of xylA-II, xylB, xylT, and xylR genes as well as the
identified XylR-binding sites in C. acetobutylicum.
(ii) Experimental validation
Mutagenesis corroborates predicted xylose pathway genes

To validate the role of the inferred xylose pathway genes
in C. acetobutylicum, we disrupted the respective genes
by inserting an intron (confirmed by PCR as shown in
Additional file 3) and tested the ability of these mutants
to grow on xylose as the sole carbon source. Inactivation
of the gene encoding putative xylose isomerase (ΔxylA-II)
or xylulokinase (ΔxylB) abolished the growth of the
resulting strains on xylose (Figure 4A) whereas their
growth on glucose was not impaired (data not shown).
The mutants did not consume any xylose after a 80-h
incubation in the minimal medium containing 20 g l-1 of
xylose (Figure 4B). Therefore, the phenotypes of C. acetobutylicum mutants were consistent with the predictions
of the bioinformatics analysis and confirmed the predicted physiological roles of xylA-II and xylB in utilization of xylose.
Heterologous-host complementation supports functional
assignments of predicted xylose pathway genes

To test whether the identified genes are not only required
but also sufficient to perform the predicted functions, we
carried out genetic complementation experiments. Plasmid constructs containing C. acetobutylicum genes xylAII and xylB were introduced into E. coli K-12 mutants
deficient in xylose isomerase (ΔxylA) or xylulokinase
(ΔxylB). The resulting strains were tested for the ability of
xylose utilization using MacConkey agar supplemented
with xylose as a carbon source (Figure 5). Expression of
the C. acetobutylicum xylA-II gene completely restored
the ability of E. coli ΔxylA mutant to utilize xylose. Similarly, expression of xylB from C. acetobutylicum successfully complemented the xylulokinase deficiency and
restored the ability of E. coli ΔxylB mutant in xylose utilization (Figure 5). On the other hand, expression of the
gene CAC1344, which is also annotated as xylulokinase in
GenBank, had no appreciable effect on the impaired
xylose utilization of ΔxylB mutant (data not shown). Our
results indicate that xylA-II and xylB of C. acetobutylicum
encode active enzymes functionally equivalent to xylose
isomerase and xylulokinase, respectively.
In vitro activity of the novel xylose isomerase and
xylulokinase

To extend the genetic findings and provide biochemical
evidence to the proposed gene assignments, we used the
recombinant XylA-II and XylB from C. acetobutylicum,
which were overexpressed in E. coli with the N-terminal
His6 tag and purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, to test for xylose isomerase and xylulokinase activities, respectively. Expected enzymatic activities of both

Figure 4 Effect of xylA-II or xylB disruption on cell growth and xylose utilization of C. acetobutylicum. Cells were grown in the medium containing 20 g l-1 of D-xylose as the sole carbon source. The optical density at 600 nm (A) and xylose concentration in the medium (B) were monitored.

proteins were verified using the specific assays described
in Materials and Methods. The specific activity of the C.
acetobutylicum XylA-II was 1.90 ± 0.14 μmol mg-1 min-1,
which is comparable with the respective values reported
for the enzyme from E. coli (0.87 μmol mg-1 min-1) [31]
while lower than that for Bacillus licheniformis XylA (22.2
μmol mg-1 min-1) [32]. The C. acetobutylicum XylB displayed a xylulokinase activity, although the specific activity value (3.04 ± 0.13 μmol mg-1 min-1) is significantly
lower than that of E. coli XylB (298 μmol mg-1 min-1) [33].
Therefore, the biochemical activity assays provided an
independent verification of the predicted enzymatic
activities of XylA-II and XylB from C. acetobutylicum.

Experimental assessment of the predicted xylose transporter
gene

To test the role of the inferred xylose transporter gene in
C. acetobutylicum, we disrupted the gene CAC1345
(xylT) by inserting an intron (confirmed by PCR as shown
in Additional file 3) and assessed the effect of its inactivation on cell growth and xylose consumption. A significant
impairment of cell growth on xylose was observed for
ΔxylT mutant compared to the wild-type strain (Figure 6)
whereas their growth on glucose was not affected (data
not shown). In the medium containing 2 g l-1 of xylose,
specific growth rate of ΔxylT mutant (0.06 h-1) was more
than three-fold lower than that of wild-type strain (0.20
h-1). After a 20-h incubation on 2 g l-1 of xylose, about

Figure 5 Complementation of E. coli mutants deficient in xylose
isomerase or xylulokinase by C. acetobutylicum genes. The empty
vector was expressed in the same strain as a negative control. The ability of xylose utilization was tested using MacConkey agar supplemented with 10 g l-1 xylose. The colonies of cells with the ability in xylose
utilization showed red color, whereas the colonies of cells unable to
utilize xylose keep yellow.

50% of xylose was consumed by the wild-type strain,
whereas the ΔxylT mutant consumed less than 8% of
xylose (Figure 6A). The difference between the growth
curves was smaller at high concentrations of xylose (e.g.
50 g l-1; data not shown). These observations suggest that
xylT contributes to the uptake of xylose in C. acetobutylicum. The obtained results also revealed that in addition
to XylT, C. acetobutylicum must have another, hithertounknown transport system for xylose uptake.
An additional verification of the xylose transporter
gene was obtained using the genetic complementation
experiment. A plasmid construct containing C. acetobutylicum xylT gene was introduced into E. coli K-12 ΔxylE
mutant that lacks xylose proton-symporter while still has
the ABC transporter system for xylose (XylFGH). The
specific growth rate of this engineered strain (0.36 h-1)
was higher than that of the control strain carrying an
empty vector plasmid (0.25 h-1) when both strains were
grown in the minimal medium containing 5 g l-1 of xylose
(Figure 7A). Concomitantly, expression of C. acetobutylicum xylT led to an acceleration in xylose consumption
(Figure 7B), indicating that the xylT gene product is able
to transport xylose. Overall, the cumulative evidence generated in the two different types of experiments described
above provided strong support for the tentative gene
assignment of the xylose transporter in C. acetobutylicum.

Figure 6 Effect of xylT disruption on cell growth and xylose utilization of C. acetobutylicum. Cells were grown in the medium containing 2 g l-1 (A) or 5 g l-1 (B) of D-xylose as the sole carbon source.
Open symbols, optical density at 600 nm; filled symbols, xylose concentration in the medium. Data shown are means ± standard deviations calculated from triplicate individual experiments.

The ability of XylR protein to specifically bind to the predicted DNA sites was tested by EMSA using the purified
recombinant XylR protein from C. acetobutylicum. The
predicted XylR-binding sites in C. acetobutylicum and
several other species represent a distinct DNA motif from
that known for Bacillus XylR (as described in the previous section). Three predicted target DNA fragments
from the upstream regions of C. acetobutylicum xylA-II,
xylB, and xylR genes, respectively, were used in EMSA. A
substantial shift of the DNA band was observed in all
three cases upon incubation of XylR protein with the target DNA fragments (Figure 8). A typical protein concentration dependence of DNA-binding is illustrated in
Additional file 4 showing increasing intensity of the
shifted DNA band in the presence of increasing amounts
of the XylR protein. The shift of the DNA band for all
three target sites was essentially complete at XylR concentration above 0.7 μM. The band shift was suppressed
in the presence of 400-fold excess unlabeled DNA fragments but not in the presence of non-specific competitor,
salmon sperm DNA (Figure 8). No binding was observed
for the negative control DNA segment without XylRbinding DNA motif (see Additional file 4). These observations provided an experimental confirmation of the target XylR-binding sites and XylR-regulated genes

with or without 0.5-0.7 μM of the XylR protein. Specificity of the XylRDNA interactions was tested by competition with 0.4 μM of non-biotinylated target DNA (specific competitor). Salmon sperm DNA (2 μg)
was added to all binding reaction mixtures as a non-specific competitor.

tentatively identified by comparative genomic techniques
(as described in the previous section).

Discussion
The comparative genomics analysis and metabolic reconstruction of the xyloside and xylose metabolic subsystem
across a broad range of Firmicutes, including C. acetobutylicum and related species from Bacilli and Clostridia
classes, revealed a remarkable pattern of conservation
and variation. The role of this subsystem in utilizing
exogenous sources of xylose, and its overall topology (Fig-

ure 1) including uptake and degradation of xyloside,
xylose transport, and the biochemical conversion of
xylose to xylulose 5-P, is preserved in all of the analyzed
species. However, nearly all these aspects of its implementation are associated with significant variations such
as: (i) existence of alternative transcriptional regulators
and regulatory DNA signals; (ii) presence or absence of
xyloside utilization machinery and variations therein; (iii)
alternative mechanisms of xylose uptake; and (iv) nonorthologous gene displacement for a key enzymatic step of
the xylose catabolism, xylose isomerase (Figure 3).
Based on the subsystem reconstruction and the
genome context analysis, we have identified a novel
xylose isomerase, XylA-II that is not homologous to previously characterized XylA. Moreover, the gene encoding
xylulokinase, XylB, was unambiguously identified in all of
the analyzed Firmicutes species. These functional predictions were experimentally validated in C. acetobutylicum
by a combination of genetic and biochemical techniques.
The observed low specific activity of XylA-II and XylB
from C. acetobutylicum is consistent with the relatively
slow growth on xylose, suggesting that these two enzymatic reactions may be rate-limiting steps of xylose utilization in this organism. It is interesting that unlike in C.
acetobutylicum and C. saccharolyticus where XylA-II is
the only xylose isomerase, both XylA-I and XylA-II are
present in C. beijerinckii and C. phytofermentans. The
exact interpretation of the observed functional redundancy in these two organisms requires further investigation.

The genes encoding xylose proton-symporter, XylT,
were tentatively identified in several genomes of Firmicutes based on analysis of conserved operons and regulons. This prediction was experimentally assessed by
mutagenesis of the inferred gene in C. acetobutylicum
and by genetic complementation in E. coli. The results
allow us to conclude that XylT is involved in xylose transport in C. acetobutylicum, although there may be additional, unknown mechanism for xylose transport. Despite
the differences in cell wall structure between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, XylT from C. acetobutylicum was recognized by the cell sorting machinery of
E. coli and functioned properly to complement xylose
symporter deficiency. It is important to emphasize that
although the performed experiments provided strong
support for the predicted functional assignment of XylT,
additional studies are necessary to establish its substrate
specificity and kinetic parameters, as well as to elucidate
the mechanism of XylT-independent xylose uptake.
Based on the genome context analysis, the genes
encoding the xylose regulator, XylR, were unambiguously
assigned in all of the analyzed species. Comparative analysis of upstream regions of the xylose and xyloside utilization genes allowed identification of candidate XylRbinding sites and reconstruction of XylR regulons. A
novel XylR-binding DNA motif, which is exceptionally
distinct from the DNA motif known for Bacillus XylR,
was identified in C. acetobutylicum, C. beijerinckii, and A.
metalliredigens. Experimental validation was performed
by EMSA using purified recombinant XylR protein. The
results confirmed the proposed gene assignment of the
xylose regulator and the predicted XylR-binding sites in
C. acetobutylicum. In addition to XylR regulation, expression of xyl genes in Bacillus is also subject to catabolite
repression mediated by the transcriptional factor CcpA
that binds to the catabolite responsive element (cre) [34].
It has been reported that xylose metabolism in Clostridium was inhibited in the presence of glucose [16]. Studies
on the involvement of CcpA and cre in regulation of xyl
genes and the contribution of XylR to glucose repression
in Clostridium, are now underway.
Since pentose sugars (i.e. xylose and xyloside) are the
most abundant carbohydrate in the hemicellulose of
lignocellulosic materials such as hardwoods and crop residues, the efficient utilization of pentose sugars offers the
opportunity to significantly reduce the cost of solvent fermentation processes. However, before this study very little was known about the machinery for xylose and
xyloside utilization in solventogenic clostridia, although
some of the strains were shown previously to have this
catabolic potential [17]. A subsystem-based approach
applied in this study has allowed us to significantly
improve the quality of gene annotations and to accurately

Page 10 of 14

infer metabolic and regulatory networks associated with
xylose and xyloside utilization in Clostridium. Key conjectures about important aspects of this subsystem were
validated by focused genetic and biochemical experiments in the model system of C. acetobutylicum ATCC
824, although other functional predictions have yet to be
experimentally verified. This study paves the way for
genetically engineering the xylose pathway in solventogenic clostridia to enhance its capability of xylose utilization.

Conclusions
We reconstructed the xylose and xyloside utilization
pathway and XylR regulons in 24 Firmicutes species by
using comparative genomics techniques. It allowed us to
discover a novel xylose isomerase that is not homologous
to previously characterized xylose isomerase, unambiguously assign the genes encoding the xylulokinase and
XylR, and tentatively identify several genes involved in
xylose transport and xyloside uptake. The key functional
predictions were further experimentally verified in C.
acetobutylicum through genetic and biochemical techniques. XylR regulons were reconstructed by identification and comparative analysis of XylR-binding sites
upstream of xylose utilization genes. We identified and
experimentally validated a novel XylR-binding DNA
motif in Clostridiales, which is exceptionally distinct
from the DNA motif known for Bacillus XylR. These
findings provided an accurate and comprehensive understanding of xylose metabolism and its regulation in the
diverse species of Firmicutes.
Methods
Bioinformatics analysis
(i) Genome resources and bioinformatics tools

Complete genomes of bacteria from the Firmicutes analyzed in this study were uploaded from GenBank http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/. These and other
related genomes used for comparative analysis are integrated in the SEED genomic database http://theseed.uchicago.edu/FIG/index.cgi. Functional coupling of
genes via clustering on the chromosome and distribution
of genes in the genomes were analyzed using the integrated SEED tools. For analysis of protein families, we
used the ClustalX [35] and PHYLIP [36] programs that
construct multiple sequence alignments and maximum
likelihood phylogenetic trees, respectively. The SignalX
program and the Genome Explorer software were used
for identification of conserved DNA motifs of transcriptional regulators and genome scanning for candidate
DNA-binding sites, respectively [37]. Sequence logos for
regulatory motifs were constructed using WebLogo package version 2.6 http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/[38].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/255

(ii) Subsystem encoding and genome context analysis

A set of subsystems-based genomic annotations and metabolic reconstruction tools implemented in the SEED
were used to capture the existing knowledge of xylose utilization pathways and to tentatively project it to a broader
collection of bacteria with completely sequenced
genomes. This approach was previously applied for the
analysis of various metabolic subsystems and for gene
and pathway discovery in a broad range of species [3941]. Briefly, a subsystem is initiated by defining a list of
functional roles (enzymes, transporters, regulators) associated with xylose utilization. This information is
obtained by review of pathway-reaction-compound
information available in public resources such as KEGG
http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ and literature related to
xylose metabolism, mostly the studies in Bacillus spp.
[27,42] and L. lactis [23]. In this study we have focused on
the xylose transport and conversion of xylose to xylulose
5-P placed in a broader functional context with feeding
(xyloside degradation and uptake). Subsystem expansion
from model species to other bacteria is accomplished by
addition of increasingly distant genomes and orthologybased projection of gene annotations. The phylogenetic
boundaries were limited to the Firmicutes phylum that
consist mainly of Bacilli and Clostridia classes. The subsystems-based approach to genome analysis and the
extensive use of a genome context (clustering on the chromosome, phylogenetic profiling, and shared regulatory
sites) allowed significant improvement of the accuracy of
gene functional assignment and pathway reconstruction.
The results of this analysis are captured in the SEED subsystem "Xylose utilization" available at http://theseed.uchicago.edu/FIG/subsys.cgi.
(iii) Regulatory signals and regulons

To identify candidate DNA-binding sites of XylR regulators, we started from a set of upstream regions of potentially co-regulated genes in small subgroups of the Bacilli/
Clostridia genomes according to the phylogenetic tree of
XylR proteins. The training sets included the upstream
regions of known XylR targets in B. subtilis and/or their
orthologs in other XylR-encoding genomes [22,27,43]. An
iterative motif detection procedure implemented in the
program SignalX was used to identify common regulatory DNA motifs in the training sets and to construct the
motif recognition profiles (for a recent review see [44]).
The constructed recognition profiles were used to scan a
subset of the Bacilli/Clostridia genomes encoding XylR
orthologs from the same subgroup on the phylogenetic
tree. Positional nucleotide weights in the recognition profile and Z-scores of candidate sites were calculated as the
sum of the respective positional nucleotide weights.
Genome scanning for additional candidate XylR-binding
sites was performed using the Genome Explorer software. The threshold for the site search was defined as the

Page 11 of 14

lowest score observed in the training set. This analysis
produced gene sets with candidate regulatory sites in the
upstream regions.
Bacterial strains, plasmids, and reagents

E. coli strains DH5α (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and
ER2275 [45] were used for gene cloning, and BL21(DE3)
(Gibco-BRL, Rockville, MD) was used for protein overexpression. E. coli K-12 knockout mutants ΔxylA (Δb3565),
ΔxylB (Δb3564) and ΔxylE (Δb4031) from the Coli
Genetic Stock Center [46] were used for complementation analysis. C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 wild-type and
mutant strains were used for analysis of growth phenotype on xylose. The pSY6 vector [47] was used for gene
disruption in C. acetobutylicum, and pUC118 (Novagen)
and pET28a (Novagen) vectors were used for protein
expression in E. coli. Enzymes for DNA manipulations
and PCR were from Fermentas, and plasmid purification
kits were from Axygen Biotechnology (Hangzhou,
China). Antibiotics, buffer components, and all reagents
for enzymatic assays were purchased from SigmaAldrich.
Gene disruption in C. acetobutylicum and phenotype
analysis

Gene disruption in C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 was performed by using group II intron-based Targetron technology as described previously [47]. Briefly, respective
350 bp fragments for retargeting introns to insert
CAC2610 (xylA-II), CAC2612 (xylB), and CAC1345
(xylT) genes were generated by one-step assembly PCR
reaction using the primers shown in Additional file 5
according to TargeTron™ gene knockout system (Sigma).
The PCR products were then digested and ligated to a
targetron plasmid pSY6, yielding the pSY6-xylA-II, pSY6xylB, and pSY6-xylT. These plasmids were methylated in
vivo in E. coli ER2275 (pAN1) [45] and electroporated
into C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824, respectively. The
transformants were selected on CGM plates with 50 μg
ml-1 erythromycin. The resulting mutants with intron
insertion of xyl genes were confirmed by PCR (see Additional file 3).
For phenotype growth assays C. acetobutylicum ATCC
824 wild-type and mutant strains were pre-cultured on
CGM medium [48] to late-exponential growth phase, and
washed twice using P2 minimal medium [49] without any
carbon sources. The cultures were started with the same
optical density at 600 nm (OD600 nm~0.04), and performed at 37°C in triplicates in 100 ml of P2 minimal
medium supplemented with 2, 5, or 20 g l-1 xylose as the
sole carbon source. Cell growth was monitored spectrophotometrically at 600 nm. Xylose was quantified by
high-pressure liquid chromatography with a model 1200
instrument (Agilent) equipped with a Waters Sugar-Pak I

column and a refractive index detector. Double distilled
water was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6
ml min-1, and the column was operated at 70°C.
Gene cloning in E. coli and complementation analysis

The full-length coding regions of CAC2610 (xylA-II),
CAC2612 (xylB), and CAC1345 (xylT) from C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 were amplified using the primers
shown in Additional file 5. PCR amplification was performed using C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 genomic
DNA. PCR fragments were cloned into the pUC118
expression vector digested by BamHI and PstI. The
resulting plasmids were transformed into E. coli ΔxylA,
ΔxylB, or ΔxylE knockout mutants for the complementation analysis. The empty vector was expressed in the
same strain and used as a negative control.
The xylA-II, xylB, and xylT genes from C. acetobutylicum were expressed constitutively under control of the
lac promoter in E. coli ΔxylA, ΔxylB, and ΔxylE, respectively. Briefly, cells were pre-cultured on Luria-Bertani
medium to mid-exponential growth phase, washed twice,
and diluted to the same optical density (OD600 nm~0.04)
using the minimal medium without any carbon sources.
Complementation experiments were carried out on modified MacConkey agar plates [50] supplemented with 10 g
l-1 xylose or on M9 minimal medium containing 5 g l-1
xylose. After incubation at 37°C for 24 h, the colonies of
cells with the ability in xylose utilization showed red color
on MacConkey agar plates, whereas the colonies of cells
unable to utilize xylose keep yellow.
Protein overexpression and purification

For protein overexpression, the CAC2610 (xylA-II),
CAC2612 (xylB), and CAC3673 (xylR) genes were PCRamplified (primers shown in Additional file 5) and cloned
into the expression vector pET28a. The recombinant proteins were overexpressed as N-terminal fusions with a
His6 tag in E. coli BL21(DE3). The cells were grown on LB
medium to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.8 at 37°C,
induced by 0.2 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside, and harvested after 12 h shaking at 20°C. Protein
purification were performed using a rapid nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose minicolumn protocol as
described previously [51]. Briefly, harvested cells were
resuspended in 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) containing
100 mM NaCl, 0.03% Brij-35, and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol supplemented with 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich).
Lysozyme was added to a concentration of 1 mg ml-1, and
the cells were lysed by freezing-thawing, followed by sonication. After centrifugation at 16,000 g, the Tris-HCl
buffer (pH 8.0) was added to the supernatant (final concentration, 50 mM), and it was loaded onto a Ni-NTA
agarose column (0.2 ml). After bound proteins were

Page 12 of 14

washed with the starting buffer containing 1 M NaCl and
0.3% Brij-35, they were eluted with 0.3 ml of the starting
buffer containing 250 mM imidazole. The buffer was then
changed to 20 mM HEPES containing 2 mM DTT, 0.5
mM EDTA and 150 mM NaCl by using Bio-Spin columns
(Bio-Rad). In all three cases, soluble proteins were
obtained with high yield (>1 mg from a 50-ml culture)
and purified to >90% by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (see Additional file 6).
In vitro enzymatic assays
(i) Xylose isomerase activity

Xylose isomerase activity was assayed by using the colorimetric method as described previously [52]. Briefly, 4-8
μg of purified enzyme was added to 100 μl of 50 mM
sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 1 mM
MnCl2, 5 mM D-xylose, and incubated for 20 min at
37°C. Formation of D-xylulose was monitored by using
the cysteine-sulfuric acid-carbazole method and reading
the absorbance at 540 nm [52]. The concentration of
xylulose was determined from a standard curve which
was made using different concentrations of xylulose. No
activity was detected in the control experiments in which
another gene (CAC2612 or CAC3673) was expressed in
the same vector and purified in parallel.
(ii) Xylulokinase activity

Xylulokinase activity was assayed by coupling the formation of ADP to the oxidation of NADH to NAD+ via pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase and monitored at
340 nm. Briefly, 3-6 μg of purified enzyme was added to
500 μl of 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mM
MgSO4, 1.2 mM ATP, 1.2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.3
mM NADH, 1.2 U of pyruvate kinase, 1.2 U of lactate
dehydrogenase, and 1 mM D-xylulose. The change in
NADH absorbance was monitored at 340 nm by using a
Beckman DU-800 spectrophotometer. A NADH extinction coefficient of 6.22 mM-1 cm-1 was used for rate calculation. No activity was detected in the control
experiments in which another gene (CAC2610 or
CAC3673) was expressed in the same vector and purified
in parallel.
Analysis of XylR-DNA interactions by EMSA

Interaction of purified recombinant XylR protein with its
DNA motif was assessed by EMSA. The 180-bp DNA
fragments from the upstream region of xyl genes were
PCR-amplified from C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824
genomic DNA using the primers shown in Additional file
5. One of the primers was 5'-biotinylated by Sangon
Corp. (Shanghai, China). The PCR products were purified with the PCR purification kit, and their concentration was determined spectrophotometrically.
For EMSA the biotin-labeled DNA (1 nM) was incubated with the indicated amount of purified XylR protein

in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5),
50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 2.5% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, and
0.05% NP-40. After 20 min incubation at 28°C, the reaction mixture was electrophoresed at 4°C on a 6% native
polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA for 2 h at
80 V. The gel was electrophoretically transferred onto a
nylon membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and fixed by
UV cross-linking. Biotin-labeled DNA was detected with
the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce,
Rockford, IL). Specificity of the XylR-DNA interactions
was tested by including a 400-fold molar excess of nonbiotinylated target DNA (specific competitor) and 2 μg
salmon sperm DNA (non-specific competitor) in binding
reaction mixtures.
