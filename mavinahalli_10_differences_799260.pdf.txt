Abstract
The N terminal transactivation domain of p53 is regulated by ligases and coactivator proteins. The
functional conformation of this region appears to be an alpha helix which is necessary for its
appropriate interactions with several proteins including MDM2 and p300. Folding simulation
studies have been carried out to examine the propensity and stability of this region and are used to
understand the differences between the family members with the ease of helix formation following
the order p53 > p73 > p63. It is clear that hydrophobic clusters control the kinetics of helix
formation, while electrostatic interactions control the thermodynamic stability of the helix.
Differences in these interactions between the family members may partially account for the
differential binding to, and regulation by, MDM2 (and MDMX). Phosphorylations of the peptides
further modulate the stability of the helix and control associations with partner proteins.

Background
The tumour suppressor protein p53 is a transcription
factor, important for the stress management of eukaryotic cells. Under cellular stress p53 activates pathways
responsible for cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, senescence
and apoptosis [1,2]. p53 partly belongs to the class of
intrinsically unstructured proteins (IUP) [3], where
certain domains get structured upon interaction with

other partners. The N-terminal transactivation domain
(TA) of p53 is intrinsically largely unstructured, and is
the binding site for components of the transcription
machinery like p300/CBP, TAFII40/60 and of negative
regulators MDM2, MDMX [4-9]. Overexpression of
MDM2/MDMX as is seen in some tumours [10] can
inactivate p53 by degradation and hence lead to tumour
survival. This makes this interaction a potential

therapeutic target for interruption in an effort to stabilize
and activate p53 [11]. p53 TA adopts an a-helical
conformation upon binding to MDM2, MDMX [12] or
to p300 [13]. NMR studies have shown that this domain
lacks persistent structural order in solution in the absence
of MDM2 or p300, except for a small region that remains
helical [14]. Thus there is a strong coupling between
binding and folding in the functional interactions of p53
and MDM2/MDMX/p300 [15]. The consensus view is that
the ability of the TA region (residues 17-29) to adopt a
helical conformation is linked to its interactions with
partners. It is important to develop a detailed understanding of how this region folds and several studies have
contributed towards this [16-18]. Peptides that have been
engineered to induce higher helicity in this region such as
the stapled peptides [19] or those with altered sequence
[20,21] have been demonstrated to bind with more
avidity than the native peptide [22].

p63 and p73. It is well known that p53 and p73 are
regulated by MDM2 in a similar manner by interactions
between their N-terminal domains [35]. However the
interaction between the N-terminal domain of p63 and
that of MDM2 has been controversial [36,37]. This is
intriguing since all three sequences contain the sequence
FXXXWXXL which is the motif recognized by the Nterminal domain of MDM2.
In this study, we set out to explore the relationship
between the nature of amino acids that constitute the 1729 region (p53 numbering) of the TA domains in this
family and their ability to fold into conformations that
may modulate their interactions with MDM2; in related
work the details of these interactions have been modelled
[38]. We examine why MDM2 interacts preferentially
with p53 and p73. In addition we attempt to distil
features that may aid in the design of high affinity
peptides that could be used to disrupt the MDM2-p53/
p73 interactions as potential therapeutics [39].

The p53 family also consists of two homologues, p63
and p73. Their main functions have been shown to be
critical for development and differentiation. p63 has
been shown to be essential for limb, skin and craniofacial morphogenesis [23-27]; and p73 has been shown to
be involved in regulation of both the stress response and
development [28]. Phylogenetic analysis of these members suggests that p53 might have evolved from an
ancestral p63/p73 like gene [29,30]. All the family
members have similar domain architecture: an Nterminal transactivation domain (TAD), a central DNA
binding domain (DBD) and a C-terminal oligomerisation domain (OD) [31,32]. The N-terminus is the least
conserved domain among the family members (~25%29% sequence identity). Interestingly, both p63 and p73
can activate sets of p53 target genes including MDM2
[30,33,34]. In addition, the three important residues
(F19, W23 and L26, see Table 1), which are key players
in the MDM2-p53 interaction, are conserved in p63 and
p73; there is no structural data available on this region of

Methods
The initial linear peptide conformers were generated using
the XLEAP module of AMBER9 [40]. MD simulations were
carried out using an implicit solvent method (GB) that has
been shown to be successful in simulating peptide folding
[41]. The major advantage of this method over using
explicit solvent is faster sampling which enables us to study
several peptides. The force field ff96 was used along with
the Onufriev, Bashford and Case model (incorporated in
AMBER under the option igb=5) [42] for optimal Born
radii for macromolecules. A salt concentration of 0.2Mm
was used. Hydrogen containing bonds were constrained
using SHAKE [43]. Simulations were carried out at 325K to
explore larger regions of conformational space. After initial
minimizations, the system was gradually heated to 325K,
equilibrated for 100 ps and production runs were carried
out for 100ns on the wild type sequences of p53/p63/p73

and several mutants; in addition, the effects of phosphorylation were also examined in p53/p73 (this stretch of p63
does not contain any S/T residues). A total of 20 peptides
(listed in Table 1) was each simulated for up to 100ns –
resulting in a total simulation time of 2μs. In addition,
80ns of explicit water simulations were carried out on
structures that were taken from the implicit solvent
simulations for p53, p63 and p73, using the TIP3P
model [44]. Analysis was carried out using Visual
Molecular Dynamics (VMD) Version 1.8.6 [45]. Cluster
analysis was performed using kclust module of the
MMTBSA tool set [46]. Grace was used to plot all the
graphs. Hydrogen bond analysis was carried out using the
ptraj module of Amber9 with a distance cut off of 3Å and
an angle cut off of 120.0 degrees.

stable only beyond residue H21 as in p63 (equivalent
residue H21), we do find that around 50ns, it extends
towards the N-terminal. What is clear is that once this
helical state is reached, stability sets in. HB analysis
(Figure 3B) shows only one backbone-backbone HB
while the other two are side chain-backbone HBs. The
occupancy of the backbone-backbone interaction is
18.4% (greater than the 11.8% seen in p63) and 11%
between positions F19 and W23. Among the conformations sampled, helices occupy 45% (Figure 3C) and their
stability lies in between that of p53 and p63. Clusters 1
and 2 represent disordered motifs.

In contrast to p53, it is clear from Figure 2A that p63
takes a relatively long time to fold into an a-helix and
this in turn does not seem to be very stable, unfolding
frequently to a disordered state. There is no evidence of
helicity at the ends of the peptide and when the helix
does form, it begins at H21 (the region of the TA that
needs to be helical for appropriate interactions with
MDM2 begins at around residue 18). Figure 2B clearly
shows that most HBs are transient with the exception of
two backbone HBs (between residues L22-L26 and D21L25) with occupancy of around 11%. Figure 2C shows
two clusters of unstructured motifs: two in b-sheet and a
single cluster representing a helical motif. Although 34%
of the structures are helical, we find that they are short
both in space and in time and transit rapidly between
helical and non-helical states.

These observations suggest that there appear to be two
factors that are crucial for the formation and persistence
of a helix in the TA domain of the p53 family: (a) the
kinetics of helix formation which is governed by the
nature of the nucleation event that gives rise to a helix
and (b) the thermodynamic stability of the helix, once
formed. It appears that in all 3 cases, nucleation occurs
around residue 22 (L in p53/p73 and I in p63) which is
always part of a turn region in these folding studies. The
stability of the helix seems to be governed in p53 by the
presence of an ionic interaction between D20 and K24.
Interestingly this may explain the strong selection seen
for the non-contact residue D20 in Mdm2 binding
peptides as selected by phage display [47] . The
equivalent residues in p63 and p73 are H/D and H/S
respectively and it is likely that the lack of such long
range interactions may lead to the attenuation of helical
stability in these two systems. There is further contribution from the stretch of hydrophobic residues in p53 and
p73 i.e., F19, L22, W23, L25 and L26 which tend to
cluster hydrophobically. Such patterns of folding
nucleated by leucines and persistence of hydrophobic
clusters have also been reported in other simulation
studies that have investigated this region [48] . Indeed, it
seems that the presence of F at position 25 in p63 tends
to enhance this aggregation by forming pi-pi interactions
with F19 which appears to limit helical formation.
Another long range interaction that appears to limit
helicity in both p63 and p73 is that mediated between
Q20, D24 and Q28 in p63 and between E20, S24 and
E27 in p73. Indeed, p53 also has a larger number of
backbone HBs and they have longer lifetimes than in
p63 and in p73; p73 in turn has more HBs than p63.
Together these seem to point towards similarities in
helical propensities of p53 and p73 and explain the low
helical propensity of the p63 peptides. This may partly
explain why only p53 and p73 are involved in similar
biological functions [49,50] and the low affinity of
MDm2 for p63.

Figure 3A shows that a-helix formation in p73 lies inbetween that of p53 and p63. While the helix initially is

We see that the conformational landscape of the family
members has, in addition to the a-helix, other secondary

Results and discussion
Folding patterns in p53, p63 and p73
Figure 1A shows that the region of p53 that embeds into
MDM2 readily folds into a helix and is stable throughout
the simulation. Although there are structural fluctuations, these are localized largely to the terminal residues,
especially the C-terminus beyond P27. These fluctuations unwind the helix for short durations. Hydrogen
bond (HB) analysis (Figure 1B) shows that a strong and
long lived (42% occupancy) back bone hydrogen bond
between L22 and E17 together with two other backbone
HBs with 29% and 21% occupancy respectively between
residues F19-W23 and S20-K24 stabilize the helix.
Analysis of conformations sampled (Figure 1C) show
four major clusters – three represent helices covering
largely the region of p53 that embeds into MDM2 (and
covers 86% of the conformational space) and a smaller
cluster represents unstructured p53.

structure elements like b-hairpins (yellow lines in
Figure 1A), and π-helix (red lines in Figure 2A). Indeed
a beta-hairpin peptide and a cyclic nucleotide with the 3
residues displayed on the same side has been shown to
bind to MDM2 [51,52], as have several peptidomimetics
[53,54]. In fact it is clear from Figures 1C and 3C that
there are several nonhelical conformations of p53 and
p73 which have at least two of the 3 residues pointing in
the same direction. This is largely missing in p63 and
could be another reason why p63 does not seem to
interact with MDM2 [55] and MDMX [56].
It is heartening to see that the implicit solvent model
maps the conformational landscape of p53 that mirrors
the essential features that have been captured in detailed
simulations in explicit solvent environments [57]. Both
studies demonstrate the existence and persistence of very
similar patterns of helicity together with the other
structural motifs. Moreover, these are also in accord
with experimental studies [3,14,58]. This agreement with
experimental and simulation data gives us confidence in
the methods that have been applied in our study and the
associated findings.
We next attempt to understand the roles of specific
residues in modulating the conformational landscapes
of the 3 peptides.

Folding patterns in variants of p53, p63 and p73
Thus far, in summary, there appear to be two major
determinants of the folding patterns of the TA domain
peptides of the p53 family: nucleation largely by
hydrophobic interactions (a kinetic determinant) and
stability induced by ion-pairs or long range electrostatics
(thermodynamic determinants). We investigate these
further by in-silico mutagenesis of residues that seem to
mediate these interactions and study their folding
patterns. Our strategy is to mutate residues in each
wild type peptide to their equivalent residues in the
other peptides, particularly when we see a difference in
their folding patterns; so for example a particular residue
in wild type p53 is mutated to the corresponding residue
in wild type p63 and vice versa.

Nucleation site mutants
Detailed examinations of the p53 trajectory (Movie S1 –
url found in the Appendix section) suggest that interactions of residue L22 nucleate the formation of the helix
(in contrast to the T18-D20 HB) [59,60]. This position is
occupied by L in p53 and in p73 and by I in p63. In the 3
simulations we observe that a turn seems to form at this
residue and is associated with an HB between the side
chain of residue D21 and the backbone of residue W23

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/S1/S5

(Figure 1D). So we mutated L22 to I in p53 and p73, and
I22 to L in p63.
In p53, the L to I change disfavors helicity; indeed the
helix seems to get truncated at position 22 (Figure 4A).
In p63, the I22L change leads to an extension of the
helical conformation both spatially and temporally
(Figure 4B). The L22I change in p73 seemed to favor a
longer and much more stable helix compared to both
the p73 wild type and to the L22I mutant of p53
(Figure 4C). L22I in p73 creates a larger space for F19
and L26 (Movie S2) that leads to more packing amongst
these hydrophobic residues; this leads to smaller
fluctuations and hence results in a more stable helix.

Ion-pair mutants
We earlier described the D21-K24 ion-pair as possibly
contributing to the stability of p53. We introduced this
ion pair in p63 and p73 at the equivalent positions and
found that both the length of the helix and its stability
were significantly increased (Figure 5, Movie S3).

The above two observations lead us to then interrogate
the significance of this region and ask if this region as a
whole may be responsible for the enhanced helicity in
wild type p53. For this, we retained the essential W23
and incorporated the flanking residues in the p53
sequence into p63 and p73 as follows: HIWD->DIWK
for p63 and HLWS->DLWK for p73. It was observed
(Figure 5A, 5B) that this certainly enhances the helicity
in both p63 and p73. In both cases, this arises directly as
a result of the introduction of K at position 24 whose
interactions with D at position 21 and E at position 27
stabilize the extent and stability of the helix (Movie S4).
The above observations suggest that the electrostatic
modification of p63 and p73 certainly has a significant
effect on inducing and stabilizing helicity. To this, we
now add the modification whereby we mutated I to L in
p63 (taking cues from the differences we identified
between p53 and p63 earlier) resulting in p63 with
HIWD->DLWK (Movie S5). The long range interaction
between D21 and K24 and a cluster of HBs between D21
side chain and back bone amines of W23, K24 and F25
initiate helix formation. Within 2-3ns, the C-terminus
becomes fully helical and is stabilized by interactions of
K24 with the anionic D21, E27 and the C-terminus
(Figure 6). At the same time, at the N-terminus, a
hydrophobic cluster comprising of residues F19, L22,
F25 and L26 was observed to form and modulate the
folding patterns. This hydrophobic cluster, which was
quite stable when the L was an I at position 22, hindered
the propagation of the helix; upon mutation, this cluster
becomes relatively short lived, largely due to the larger

fluctuations of L22 compared to those in I22. The
ensuing destabilization of the hydrophobic cluster
results in a transition of F19 away from F25 and this
leads to propagation of the helix at N-terminus. Of
course, in p73 we see a similar picture, but now the I22
leads to such propagation (peptide 6, Table 1, Movie
S6), thus underlying the complexity of the relationship
between sequence and folding patterns.
Hydrophobic clusters
As we have seen above, π-π interactions in p63 and in all
its variants seem to modulate the folding patterns. In
particular, interactions between F19 and F25 in the

hydrophobic cluster appear to hinder helical propagation. To examine this, we studied L25F in p53, F25L in
p63 and S25F in p73.
It is clear (Figure 7A, Movie S7) that p53 is severely
destabilized, apart from a transient period of helicity as
the introduced F collapses against F19 (as seen in wild
type p63). In contrast, we see that in p63, the helix is
indeed propagated (Figure 7B, Movie S8) due to the
F25L mutation including the formation of full length
helical structures. The analogous mutation in P73 is
S25F and this leads to rapid helix formation followed by
its stability (Figure 7C, Movie S9).

Effect of phosphorylation
Phosphorylation of the TA region of this family controls
several of its biologically significant interactions [61]
such as interactions with the negative regulator MDM2/
MDMX and with the coactivator proteins such as p300
[13]. While the structural implications of this modification on these interactions is understood to some extent
for p53 [13,59,60,62,63] little is known about p63 and
p73. Having established that our current methodology
seems to reproduce experimental data on p53 and
rationalize the effects of the differences in sequence
amongst the family members, we now examine the
effects of phosphorylation on the family members.

The region of p53 investigated here has two phosphorylation sites - T18 and S20. Phosphorylation of T18
resulted in some loss of helical propensity (Figure 8A)
compared to that in unphosphorylated p53 and this
largely seems to arise because of long range interactions
between the phosphate and K24 that prevent helical
propagation (Movie S10). However helicity is still
retained, albeit reduced, and is in accord with our earlier
findings [63]. In contrast, phosphorylation of S20 actually
enhances the helical propensity of p53 (Figure 8B). This
appears to be stabilized by interactions between the
phosphate and K24. The reason why this interaction

stabilizes the helix appears to be the spatial proximity of
these two in contrast to the case of phosphorylated T18.
These folding patterns are consistent with the binding
affinity of p53 to MDM2 where only the phosphorylation of T18 attenuates binding to MDM2 [18]. Indeed,
the phosphorylation of S20 needs a helical conformation as this appears to be a structural requirement for
binding to p300 [64]. When both T18 and S20 are
phosphorylated the folding pattern (Figure 8C) seemed
to display an initial effect of phosphorylation of T18
(as in Figure 8A) followed by that of S20 (Figure 8B).
Consistent with the individual phosphorylations, the
pattern of interactions seen upon double phosphorylation is conserved. Recent work has demonstrated that
p53 has to be significantly helical to optimally interact
with p300 [62] and perhaps even for simultaneous
binding to MDM2 and p300 [13]. Our observations also
suggest that double phosphorylation does retain the
helicity required for binding to p300 and that dephosphorylation of T18 is not required prior to phosphorylation of S20 for such binding events.
In the case of p73, there are four potential phosphorylation sites – T17, T18, S24 and S25 (Table 1, Sequence 3).
Phosphorylation at T17 and T18 increases the helicity
much more compared to that seen in unphosphorylated

p73 (Figure 9A – 9B). This latter is known to be required
for binding of p73 to p300 [62] and our model suggests
that the picture is somewhat similar to that seen in p53.
Further, our models correlate well with the experimental
finding that phosphorylated p73 binds to MDM2 two
fold better than does phosphorylated p53 (Compare
Figure 8A with Figure 9B). Interestingly phosphorylations at S24 and S25 show no helicity at all (Figure 9C –
9D) and may suggest modifications either for dissociations of p73 from partners or for associations with other
proteins; experimental data on these is not available yet.
Long range repulsive interactions between the developing anionic environment as a result of phosphorylation
and the acidic residues E20, E27 seems to be responsible
for the lack/loss of helicity. It appears that position T18
in p53 and positions S24 and S25 in p73 are switches
that control the helical nature of the peptide.

Effects of explicit solvent
In order to test the robustness of these simulations, we
extracted snapshots along the trajectories describing the
folding of p53, p63 and p73 and carried out simulations
on these in explicit water. The snapshots were chosen to
represent the states that we have identified as nucleation
points. For p53, we additionally examine a state which
was characterized by an ionic interaction between D21
and K24 to examine the stability of this salt bridge. We
see that p53 readily folds into a helix in both cases
(Figure 10A, Figure 10B), as does p73 (Figure 10D),
albeit somewhat less readily. In contrast, p63 folds
(Figure 10C) into a helix very late in our simulation, but
nevertheless folds. The salt bridge between D21 and K24
in p53 appears to “catalyzes” the rapid onset of helicity
(Movie S11 and Movie S12) and is non-existent in p63
and p73. The delay in p63 is due to the stable
hydrophobic cluster (Movie S13).
Together these data show that the implicit solvent model
captures the essential features of the folding patterns of
these sequences although it is clear from the p63 data
that explicit solvent does mediate barrier crossings that
enable the transition from the cluster to the folded helix
[65].
Finally, although all 3 fold into helices, and indeed p73
seems to form a longer helix (Movie S14), there are two
characteristics that can be used to understand why the
order of binding is p53>p73>p63. The first is that
MDM2 modulates the binding of these peptides as has
been shown elsewhere [20,38]. The second feature is the
observation in the current study that while p53 forms a
helix rapidly (see for example Figure 10A), the onset is
delayed in p73 (Figure 10D) and only occurs very late in
the simulation in p63 (Figure 10C).

Conclusions
Folding studies of the TA domain of the p53 family in an
implicit solvent model support earlier findings that p53
TF is intrinsically largely unstructured with some regions
of helicity and an overall high propensity for helical
structure. This helix is responsible for mediating the
interactions of these proteins with a range of partners.
Helical propensity is similar between p53 and p73, but is
very low for p63. Mutations suggest that electrostatic
interactions mediated by K24 are important for the
thermodynamic stability of the helix, whose nucleation
and kinetics are in turn controlled by the size of the
hydrophobic residue at position 22 (stabilizing hydrophobic clusters). Successful benchmarks against available experimental/computational data for p53 enabled
us to suggest mutations in peptides derived from p63
and p73 that could bind effectively to MDM2. Further,
we find that the effects of phosphorylations (perturbation of helicity due to phosphorylation of T18 and
enhancement of helicity due to phosphorylation of S20)
are in accord with experimental findings and suggest that
the helical propensity of phosphorylated S20 in p53 is
very high. This enables doubly phosphorylated p53 (at
T18 and S20) to bind to p300 without the need for
dephosphorylating T18. Our results also are in accord
with the thesis that p53 may exist as a ternary complex in
unstressed cells with MDM2 and with p300 and that
stress related phosphorylation of T18 and S20 will
enable dissociation of MDM2 and tighter association
with p300 – an event directly linked to enhanced
helicity. This also corroborates our earlier finding
[59,60,63] that phosphorylation of T18 does not
diminish helicity of TA to the extent that it should
disrupt binding to MDM2; indeed the disruption of
binding was attributed to the development of electrostatic repulsions between phosphorylated T18 and the
MDM2 surface and our current results are in accord with
our earlier hypothesis [17]. Phosphorylation of p73 at
T17 and T18 enhances the helicity much more than at
equivalent position in p53 and may be responsible for
the higher affinity of phosphorylated p73 for MDM2 and
for p300 [62]. Similarities in helicity in p53 and p73
may be one of the reasons why p73 was able to replace
p53 in p53-deficient breast cancer cells [66]. This also
may have implications for the differential regulation of
post-translationally modified p53 and p73. For example
p53 is stabilized by releasing it from sequestration by
MDM2 while p73-dependant transcription is abrogated
(perhaps by tighter binding to MDM2) during events
such as mitosis [67].
Finally our results also point towards some resolution of
the controversy over the interaction between MDM2 and
p63 [36,37]. It is clear that under conditions such as an
excess of MDM2 and/or low concentrations of p53, the

interaction of MDM2 with p63 occurs [36]. This is in line
with in-vitro observations that do suggest weak interactions between the two [68] . Together, the fact that the
FXXXWXXL motif is shared by p53, p63 and p73 and this
pattern is recognized by MDM2 suggests that MDM2
should bind to all 3 proteins. Our results show that the
hydrophobic cluster that forms in p63 “slows” down
folding but yet eventually does lead to a conformation
that is suitable for sequestration by MDM2; this may
partly be responsible for the experimental demonstrations of weak interaction between p63 and MDM2
(relative to the interactions between MDM2 and p53/
p73). This possibly may account for the transient nature
of this complex and hence evades trapping [36]. In
addition, as we have shown elsewhere, the dynamic
surface of MDM2 modulates the interactions with these
peptides [20,38]. While there is always the possibility of
additional protein players in these orchestrated interactions, nevertheless, the current observations certainly
show that the intrinsic propensity of these sequences
determine their abilities to fold into states that can
interact with modulator proteins such as MDM2, with
varying affinities and this in turn will impinge upon their
biological functions.
