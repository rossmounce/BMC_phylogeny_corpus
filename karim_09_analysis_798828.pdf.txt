Abstract
Background: The fungivorus nematode, Aphelenchus avenae is widespread in soil and is found in
association with decaying plant material. This nematode is also found in association with plants but its
ability to cause plant disease remains largely undetermined. The taxonomic position and intermediate
lifestyle of A. avenae make it an important model for studying the evolution of plant parasitism within the
Nematoda. In addition, the exceptional capacity of this nematode to survive desiccation makes it an
important system for study of anhydrobiosis. Expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis may therefore be
useful in providing an initial insight into the poorly understood genetic background of A. avenae.
Results: We present the generation, analysis and annotation of over 5,000 ESTs from a mixed-stage A.
avenae cDNA library. Clustering of 5,076 high-quality ESTs resulted in a set of 2,700 non-redundant
sequences comprising 695 contigs and 2,005 singletons. Comparative analyses indicated that 1,567 (58.0%)
of the cluster sequences had homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans, 1,750 (64.8%) in other nematodes,
1,321(48.9%) in organisms other than nematodes, and 862 (31.9%) had no significant match to any
sequence in current protein or nucleotide databases. In addition, 1,100 (40.7%) of the sequences were
functionally classified using Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy. Similarity searches of the cluster sequences
identified a set of genes with significant homology to genes encoding enzymes that degrade plant or fungal
cell walls. The full length sequences of two genes encoding glycosyl hydrolase family 5 (GHF5) cellulases
and two pectate lyase genes encoding polysaccharide lyase family 3 (PL3) proteins were identified and
characterized.
Conclusion: We have described at least 2,214 putative genes from A. avenae and identified a set of genes
encoding a range of cell-wall-degrading enzymes. This EST dataset represents a starting point for studies
in a number of different fundamental and applied areas. The presence of genes encoding a battery of cellwall-degrading enzymes in A. avenae and their similarities with genes from other plant parasitic nematodes
suggest that this nematode can act not only as a fungal feeder but also a plant parasite. Further studies on
genes encoding cell-wall-degrading enzymes in A. avenae will accelerate our understanding of the complex
evolutionary histories of plant parasitism and the use of genes obtained by horizontal gene transfer from
prokaryotes.

Background
The complete genome sequence of the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the wealth of information
on gene expression and function for this nematode [1,2]
provide an excellent starting point for genome analysis of
other nematodes. For less well studied organisms, where
whole genome sequencing is currently unlikely, Expressed
Sequence Tag (EST) analysis is a cost-effective method for
gene discovery. EST analysis has been widely used within
the Phylum Nematoda. However, most effort has been
focused on plant or animal parasitic nematodes. Free living nematodes, with the notable exceptions of C. elegans,
C. briggsae and Pristionchus pacificus, remain under represented in terms of ESTs.
Aphelenchus avenae is a well-known fungal feeding nematode that is currently placed in the superfamily Aphelenchoidea (family Aphelenchidae) [3]. This nematode is
ubiquitous in soil and is associated with saprophytic,
pathogenic, and mycorrhizal fungi. As a fungal feeder, A.
avenae has potential as a bio-control agent against soilborne fungal plant pathogens [4-8] and, as it has a
remarkable ability to survive desiccation; it is also used as
a model system for studying anhydrobiosis in animals [9].
Although A. avenae is commonly found in soil samples
taken from the rhizospheres of diseased and healthy
plants, it is widely considered to be incapable of attacking
healthy tissues of higher plants [10,11]. It has been suggested that when the nematode is found in association
with plant material this occurs as a result of the nematode
feeding on fungi associated with the plant. Alternatively,
the finding of A. avenae within plant tissues [12,13] and
its demonstrated ability to reproduce on plant callus
material [13,14] may show that it can survive in healthy
plant tissues and act as a facultative plant parasite. The
role, if any, of A. avenae in relation to plant disease therefore remains uncertain.
In a previous study [15], we described the generation,
analysis and annotation of over 10,000 ESTs from the
pinewood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, a pathogenic nematode species which was thought to belong to
the same superfamily (Aphelenchoidea) as A. avenae [3]
(but see below) and which can feed on live trees as well as
on fungi. Genes encoding a range of cell-wall-degrading
enzymes including cellulase (β-1,4-endoglucanase) [16],
β-1,3-endoglucanase[17], pectate lyase [18] and expansin
[19] were subsequently identified and characterized from
this nematode. Similar enzymes [20-33] have also been
identified and characterized from other plant parasitic
nematodes including cyst and root-knot nematodes.
These enzymes are produced within the esophageal gland
cells of the nematode, secreted through the nematode
stylet into host tissues and are thought to play an impor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/525

tant role in the host-parasite interaction, allowing invasion and migration of the nematode through plant
tissues. The presence of these enzymes is unusual; they are
not usually present in animals and it is thought that the
genes encoding them may have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer [34,35].
In classical taxonomic classification, A. avenae (family
Aphelenchidae) has been placed in the same superfamily
(Aphelenchoidea) as B. xylophilus (family Aphelenchoididae) whereas cyst and root-knot nematodes are placed in
a different superfamily, the Tylenchoida (family Tylenchida), although the three nematode groups are all placed
within the infraorder Tylenchromorpha [3]. However,
recent phylogenetic studies using ribosomal DNA suggest
that A. avenae is more closely related to cyst and root-knot
nematodes than it is to B. xylophilus [36-38]. The current
view of the taxonomy of three nematode groups is summarized in Fig. 1.
Although some of the parasitism genes are common to
both superfamiles, Aphelenchoidea (Bursaphelenchus) and
Tylenchoidea (cyst and root-knot nematodes), there are
also differences between the parasitism genes present in
the two nematode groups [3]. For example, Bursaphelenchus and cyst/root-knot nematodes contain endogenous
expansins and pectate lyases which appear to have been
acquired by a common ancestor via horizontal gene transfer [18,19]. However, the cellulases in the two groups are
different. Those present in cyst and root-knot nematodes
are from glycosyl hydrolase family 5(GHF5) and are likely
to have been acquired from bacteria whereas those in Bursaphelenchus are from GHF45 and appear to have been
acquired from fungi [35]. Nothing is currently known
about such pathogenicity genes in A. avenae and the presence or absence of such genes in this nematode may shed
light onto whether this nematode can act as a plant paraPanagrolaimoidea

site. In addition, the presence of such horizontally
acquired genes in A. avenae may also help reveal the evolutionary history of these genes within nematodes.
To address these issues, we have generated over 5,000
high quality ESTs from a mixed-stage A. avenae cDNA
library. We report the identification of genes that could
encode enzymes that degrade the cell walls of plants or
fungi. We have also analysed the clustered A. avenae
sequences using the Gene Ontology (GO) classification
system and undertaken comparative analysis with C. elegans and other nematode protein databases.

Results and Discussion
Generation of ESTs from an A. avenae cDNA library
A mixed-stage A. avenae cDNA library (Aamk) was constructed to generate ESTs (Table 1). Sixteen clones were
randomly selected and the sizes of the inserts in these
clones were assessed after digestion with appropriate
restriction enzymes. These insert sizes ranged from 400 to
1,600 base pairs (bp) with an average of 1.1 kilobase pairs
(kb). A total of 5,472 cDNA clones were subsequently randomly isolated and sequenced from the 5' end in order to
generate ESTs. The sequences were trimmed of vector
sequence, adaptor sequence, poly(A) tail and low-quality
sequence and filtered for minimum length (150 bp),
resulting in a total of 5,076 high quality ESTs. The average
length of submitted ESTs was 468 nucleotides (nt).
Cluster formation and analysis
To identify overlapping EST sequences, improve base
accuracy and transcript length, and to produce nonredundant EST data for further functional annotation and
comparative analysis, the 5,076 ESTs from the A. avenae
library were grouped by sequence identity into clusters.
Based upon regions of nucleotide identity, EST sequences
were merged into contiguous consensus sequences (contigs). 'Contig' member ESTs derive from identical transcripts while 'cluster' members may derive from the same
gene but represent different transcript splice isoforms (i.e
ESTs form contigs, contigs form clusters). Two thousand
seven hundred non-redundant EST clusters were generated from the ESTs (Table 1). In 2,005 cases, clusters consist of a single EST, whereas the largest single cluster
contains 81 ESTs (1 case) (Fig. 2). The majority of contigs

(650 out of 695) were composed of 2-10 ESTs. 89 clusters
were found to contain multiple contig members, revealing
potential splice isoforms. By eliminating redundancy during this contig building, the total number of nucleotides
used for further analysis was reduced from 2.82 million to
1.61 million. In addition, this process significantly
increased the length of assembled transcript sequences
from 468 ± 114 nt for submitted ESTs alone to 595 ± 321
nt for contigs. The longest sequence generated also
increased from 724 to 2,154 nt.
Based on the identified clusters 2,700 A. avenae genes were
identified, corresponding to a new gene discovery rate of
53% (2,700/5,076). However, 2700 clusters is likely to be
an overestimate of the true gene discovery rate, as one
gene could be represented by multiple nonoverlapping
clusters. Such "fragmentation" has been estimated at 18%
using C. elegans as a reference genome [39]. After allowing
for such potential fragmentation, we estimated that the A.
avenae sequences derived from minimum of 2,214 genes
giving a discovery rate of 44% (2,214/5,076). Assuming
between 14,000 and 21,000 total genes, the range encompassed by Meloidogyne hapla [40], M. incognita [41] and C.
elegans (Wormpep v. 203), the cluster dataset could represent approximately 11-16% of A. avenae genes.
Transcript abundance and highly represented genes
A high level of representation in a cDNA library usually
correlates with high transcript abundance in the original
biological sample [42], although artifacts of library construction can result in a selection for or against some transcripts. The A. avenae clusters were ranked according to the
number of contributing ESTs, and the top 25 clusters are
summarized in Table 2. Each of these clusters contained
fifteen or more EST copies and represented 16% of the
total number of ESTs obtained. Eighteen of the clusters
had significant matches to genes with annotated functions
based on BLASTX (E < 1e-5) against the non-redundant
database, and all of these had homologues in nematodes.
Transcripts abundantly represented in the A. avenae
library included genes encoding structural proteins (such
as actin, collagen, tropomyosin and troponin C) and proteins which carry out core metabolic processes (e.g. cytochrome c oxidase, ATP synthase). Other abundant ESTs
included a small heat shock protein and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. The latter enzyme has previously been cloned from the parasitic nematodes,
Haemonchus contortus and Ascaris suum [43,44]. Cluster
AAC00541, containing 23 ESTs, was similar to an SXP/
RAL-2 family protein from the parasitic nematode, Anisakis simplex. Similar genes have previously been characterized from plant parasitic nematodes [45], and
individual genes have been shown to be expressed in a
range of secretory tissues including the gland cells sur-

rounding the main sense organs (amphids) and the hypodermis.
Seven of the 25 most abundantly represented transcripts
from A. avenae had no significant similarity to any
sequence in the non-redundant protein database (Table
2). Since most nematode data are available only as ESTs
and therefore not included in the BLASTX analysis, we
compared these 7 contigs against dbEST using BLASTN
and TBLASTX. However, these searches returned no significant matches (E < 1e-5). We also conducted BLASTN and
TBLASTX searches against the non-redundant nucleotide
database for these sequences. Six of the clusters did not
return any matches from this database but cluster
AAC00148 produced a match using TBLASTX analysis (E
< 1e-5) (Table 2).
Comparisons to proteins from other species
We compared the 2,700 cluster sequences from A. avenae
against three databases containing protein sequences
from different organisms. The cluster sequences were
compared with protein sequences from (i) C. elegans
(WORMPEP v.203 [46]), (ii) other nematodes (available
protein sequences and peptides from conceptually translated ESTs), and (iii) organisms other than nematodes

(from the NCBI non-redundant protein database) [47].
66% of the A. avenae clusters (1,782 of 2,700) had
matches in one or more of the three databases and these
matches were represented using SimiTri [48] (Fig. 3). In
the majority of cases where homologies were found
(1,242/1,782), matches were found in all three databases
surveyed. Gene products in this category are generally
widely conserved across metazoans and many are
involved in core biological processes. Examination of the
individual database searches showed that 1,567 (58.0%)
had homologues in C. elegans, 1,750 (64.8%) in other
nematodes and 1,321 (48.9%) in organisms other than
nematodes. The 918 clusters (34.0%) which had no significant similarity to any sequences in these three protein
databases were searched against non-redundant nucleotide and dbEST databases using BLASTN and TBLASTX
(employing a cut-off of 1e-05). 56 clusters generated
matches in these searches but no matches were obtained
for the remaining 862 sequences (31.9%).
Table 3 shows the 15 gene products with the highest level
of conservation (E-value ranging from 0 to e-151)
between A. avenae and C. elegans; these include gene products involved in cell structure (for example, actin, UNC87), protein biosynthesis or regulation (for example,

UBQ-1, elongation factor,) and metabolism (for example,
enolase, cytochrome c oxidase). Representation of these
clusters in the A. avenae EST collection varied from 81
ESTs to 2 ESTs. None of these most conserved gene products were nematode specific. Out of all clusters, 461
(17.1%) had homology only to nematodes, either C. elegans (4), other nematodes (137), or both (320) (Fig. 3).
The most conserved (1e-111) of these nematode-specific
proteins was a homolog of a serine proteinase inhibitor,
previously characterized from C. elegans (K10D3.4) and
parasitic nematodes [49,50]. Among the other most conserved nematode-specific clusters were homologs of previously characterized C. elegans structural proteins (for
example cluster, AAC01973 matched to a collagen family
protein, COL-176) as well as uncharacterized C. elegans
hypothetical proteins (for example, cluster, AAC01948
matched C. elegans gene, C34E7.4 which has no known
function).
The 137 cluster sequences where homologs were present
only in other nematodes were further categorized based
on their BLAST (BLASTX and TBLASTX) results (Additional file 1). Matches were found in plant parasitic, animal parasitic and free living nematodes. 24.8% of
sequences (34 of 137) had homology only to sequences
from plant parasitic nematodes. Some of these sequences
were similar to previously characterized cell-wall-degrading enzymes, which are known to be involved in the parasitism process of these nematodes. For example, cluster,
AAC01592 matched an expansin-like protein from B. xylophilus [19] and cluster, AAC02968 matched a β-1,4endoglucanase precursor from Globodera rostochiensis [20].
Further analysis of some of the cell-wall-degrading
enzymes present in A. avenae is presented below.

Identification of transcripts similar to stress-response
genes related to desiccation
BLASTX (E < 1e-5) searches of A. avenae cluster sequences
against nr protein databases allowed identification of
genes that can encode proteins or enzymes important in
providing protection against desiccation or other environmental-stress (Additional file 2). One notable observation
was the presence of sequences similar to late embryonic
abundant (LEA) proteins, which are known to be associated with tolerance to water stress resulting from desiccation [9]. Protein aggregation during desiccation is likely to
be a major potential hazard for anhydrobiotes; LEA proteins may act as molecular chaperones or molecular
shields and play an important role in the prevention of
this aggregation [51]. Thirteen ESTs, distributed in three
clusters, (AAC00729, AAC00888, and AAC01781) were
identified as having significant similarity to LEA proteins.
Cluster, AAC01781 which was identified as a singleton
matched a previously characterized LEA protein from desiccated A. avenae [9]. In addition, we also identified multiple copies of cytochrome P450, superoxide dismutase,
glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione S-transferase,
enzymes involved in protection against oxidative damage.
Desiccation stress of nematodes caused significant up-regulation of transcripts encoding these genes [52,53].
Functional classification based on gene ontology
Gene Ontology (GO) has been used widely to predict
gene function and classification [54]. BLAST2GO [55,56],
a universal, web-based annotation tool was used to assign
GO terms for the A. avenae cluster sequences, extracting
them from each BLAST hit against Swiss-Prot obtained by
mapping to extant annotation associations. 1222
sequences out of 2,700 did not retrieve any BLAST results
within the set E-value threshold (< 1e-5). Mapping of GO
terms and annotation were not possible for 173 and 205
sequences, respectively. The remaining 1,100 (40.7%)

sequences were successfully annotated and mapped to
one or more of the three organizing principles of GO: biological process, molecular function and cellular component. The matches obtained from this analysis are
summarized in Figs 4A-4C.
1,003 of the A. avenae cluster sequences generated
matches in the "molecular function" class, 933 in the
"biological process" class and 924 in the "cellular component" class. Within the "biological process" class the "regulation

biological
process
(GO:0050789)",
"biosynthetic process (GO:0009058)" and "transport
(GO:0006810)" categories were the most represented followed by "response to stimulus (GO:0050896) ", based
(A)

on the annotation assigned by BLAST2GO (Fig. 4A).
Within the "molecular function" class the "protein binding (GO:0005515)" term is the most represented followed by "nucleotide binding (GO:0000166)" and
"transferase activity (GO:0016740)" (Fig. 4B). Many cluster sequences encoding ribosomal proteins as well as
highly expressed genes coding for structural molecules
(such as actin) and regulatory molecules (such as transcription factors) are assigned to the "protein binding"
term. Since those clusters are abundantly present in the
dataset, this may cause overrepresentation of the "protein
binding" term. Within the "cellular component" class the
"mitochondrion (GO:0005739)" is the most highly represented (Fig. 4C). A complete listing of GO mappings

Additional file 3.
Identification of transcripts encoding cell-wall-degrading
enzymes
BLASTX analysis allowed us to identify various genes with
significant similarity to genes encoding enzymes which
degrade plant and fungal cell walls (Table 4). The plant
cell-wall-degrading enzymes that were identified included
cellulase, pectate lyase, polygalacturonase and expansin,
while transcripts encoding fungal cell-wall-degrading
enzymes included β-1,3-endoglucanase and chitinase.

Eight cellulase genes were present in 8 different A. avenae
clusters and in all cases homologues were found in other
plant parasitic nematodes. One cellulase gene
(AAC01152) was identified as a contig of six individual
ESTs. Two clusters (AAC00199 and AAC00801) contained
2 ESTs each and remaining cellulase clusters were present
as a singleton. Two types of pectin degrading enzymes:
pectate lyase and polygalacturonase were identified
(Table 4). While all transcripts encoding pectate lyase
genes were identified as singletons, polygalacturonase

clusters contained either single or two individual ESTs.
The features of the sequences of cellulase and pectate lyase
are discussed in more detail below.
In addition to the plant cell-wall-degrading enzymes, we
identified genes encoding expansin-like proteins in the A.
avenae dataset. Expansins and expansin-like proteins have
recently been described in several plant parasitic nematodes [19,31-33] and it is thought that these proteins disrupt non-covalent bonds in the plant cell wall, enhancing
the activity of other enzymes such as cellulases. All four
expansin-like transcripts were identified as a best match
with the expansin genes from the B. xylophilus [19].
Two different types of genes, β-1,3-endoglucanase and
chitinase, that could encode enzymes, important in degradation of the fungal cell wall were identified. A gene
encoding a β-1,3-endoglucanase has been cloned and
characterized from B. xylophilus [17] and is thought to aid
fungal feeding in this nematode. Chitinase, an enzyme
responsible for breakdown of β-1,4-glycosidic bonds
within chitin, has been found in wide ranges of nematodes. Since chitin is known to be present in the eggshell

[57] and the microfilarial sheath [58] of nematodes, it has
been suggested that chitinases have a role in remodeling
processes during the molting of filariae and in the hatching of larvae from the eggshell [59,60]. However, the existence of large families of chitinases in the free-living
nematode C. elegans suggests that these enzymes may also
fulfill other functions [61]. In the plant parasitic nematode, Heterodera glycines, chitinase was found to be
expressed in the subventral oesophageal gland cells of the
parasitic stages of this nematode, suggesting a role in parasitism but not in hatching [62]. The fungal feeding plant
parasitic B. xylophilus also contains chitinase [15]. Since β1,3-glucan and chitin are the two major structural polysaccharides of the fungal cell-wall, it is possible that fungal
feeding nematodes like B. xylophilus and A. avenae secrete
these enzymes in order to metabolize or soften the fungal
cell wall as part of the feeding process.

cluster, AAC001152 (Table 4). Although, six individual
ESTs, form a contig to represent this cluster, one EST was
selected as it showed a slightly different nucleotide
sequence from the other five ESTs. Two different plasmid
clones containing the full length cDNA sequences of the
cellulases were subsequently selected and sequenced
using the specific primers listed in Table 5.

Characterisation of genes encoding cellulases and pectate
lyases; analysis of sequences, phylogentics and expression
analysis
Cellulase and pectate lyase have been identified and characterized in a wide range of plant parasitic nematodes
[16,18,20-29]. The presence of genes encoding cell-walldegrading enzymes in A. avenae opens up a new avenue
for further molecular studies aimed at understanding their
functional role in this nematode and investigating the origin and evolution of these genes within the Nematoda.
We therefore cloned the full length cDNA and genomic
sequences of two putative cellulases (named Aa-eng-1 and
Aa-eng-2) and two putative pectate lyases (named Aa-pel-1
and Aa-pel-2) and compared these sequences to those
from other plant parasitic nematodes.

The Aa-eng-1 cDNA was 1,104 bp in length (excluding the
polyA tail) and included a 981-bp open reading frame
(ORF) that could encode a protein of 327 amino acids
with an ATG start codon at position 35 and a TGA stop
codon at position 1,016 (Fig. 5). The complete cDNA of
Aa-eng-2 was 1,107 bp in length and also contained a
potential ORF of 327 amino acids with an ATG start
codon at position 35 and TGA stop codon at 1,016. A signal peptide of 19 amino acids is predicted by SignalP [63]
at the N terminus of the deduced AA-ENG-1 and AA-ENG2 polypeptides. The predicted molecular masses of the
putative mature proteins were 34.130 kDa and 34.059
kDa respectively and the theoretical pI value was 6.2 for
both proteins. The AA-ENG-1 and AA-ENG-2 proteins
contained a catalytic domain homologous to GHF5 β-1,4endoglucanases as predicted by PRODOM [64]. The
deduced amino acid sequences showed highest similarity
with the GHF5 endoglucanase from the migratory plant
parasitic nematode Radopholus similis (GenBank Accession
No. [ABV54446]). The highest non-nematode similarities
of both AA-ENG-1 and AA-ENG-2 were with the β-1,4endoglucanase from Cytophaga hutchinsoni (cellulolytic
gliding
bacterium;
GenBank
Accession
No.
[YP_678708]). AA-ENG-1 and AA-ENG-2 share 99% identity in their amino acid sequences.

The full-length sequences of the cellulases were identified
from two plasmid clones whose EST sequences are part of

Genomic clones of Aa-eng-1 and Aa-eng-2 were obtained
by PCR amplification using gene-specific primers (Table

5) and genomic DNA as template. The Aa-eng-1 and Aaeng-2 genomic DNA products were1,518 bp and 1,522 bp
long respectively from the ATG to the stop codon. The
position of exon/intron boundaries of the genomic
sequences were determined by aligning the genomic
sequences with the corresponding cDNA sequences. All
introns were bordered by canonical cis-splicing sequences
[65]. Five introns were identified in Aa-eng-1 (Fig. 5) of
which four introns were small (40 bp to 85 bp) a feature
commonly found in nematodes [66]. Only the first intron
was larger (319 bp). Five introns were also identified in
Aa-eng-2. The first intron was 337 bp long and the length
of remaining four introns ranged from 40 to 72 bp. The
intron positions of Aa-eng-1 and Aa-eng-2 genes were
identical to each other.
Sequence alignment of the two endoglucanases from A.
avenae with GHF5 endoglucanases from nematodes and

other organisms revealed that both AA-ENG-1 and AAENG-2 possess a consensus pattern of GHF5 endoglucanases in their primary amino acid sequences in which two
glutamic acids residues are the predicted proton donor
and mucleophile/base of the catalytic site (Fig. 5) which is
also true for all previously described nematode GHF5
endoglucanases. In addition to the catalytic domain some
of these proteins contain a cellulose binding domain
(CBD) joined to the catalytic domain through a linker
peptide. The GHF5 endoglucanase genes isolated from
plant parasitic nematodes have also different structures:
all have a signal peptide and catalytic domain, some have
an additional linker and CBD and others only have a
linker but no CBD [25,67]. However, neither peptide linkers nor CBD domains were present in the two GHF5
endoglucanases isolated from A. avenae. Expansins from
cyst nematodes have also been shown to contain a CBD,

but no such domains were predicted in other sequences
within the EST dataset, including the putative expansins.

tode GHF5 cellulases evolved from a GHF5 sequence
acquired by a common ancestor of this group.

A phylogenetic tree was generated from an alignment of
the β-1,4-endoglucanase protein sequences from AAENG-1, AA-ENG-2, cyst and root-knot nematodes, the
migratory plant-parasitic nematodes R. similis, Pratylenchus penetrans, Pratylenchus coffeae and Ditylenchus africanus and GHF5 cellulases from phytophagous beetles,
bacteria and protists (Fig. 6). AA-ENG-1 and AA-ENG-2
clustered into a larger group of protein sequences including all nematode GHF5 cellulases, indicating that A. avenae cellulases are closely related to those of the
Tylenchida. This analysis supports the idea that all nema-

The β-1,4-endoglucanases are the largest family of cellwall-degrading enzymes that have been identified in parasitic nematodes to date. Over the last decade, a large
number of GHF5 endoglucanases have been identified
and extensively studied in plant parasitic Tylenchida
including cyst and root-knot nematodes [20-25]. Genes
encoding β-1,4-endoglucanases have also been found in
Bursaphelenchus spp but these enzymes are most similar to
GHF45 cellulases from fungi [16]. The presence of GHF5
cellulases within A. avenae (as opposed to GHF45 cellulases) provides further support for the suggestion that this

nematode is more closely related to the Tylenchida than
to Bursaphelenchus and its relatives.
Although the presence of GHF5 cellulases within A. avenae can be readily explained given the phylogenetic arguments above, the presence of a β-1,3-endoglucanase is
more surprising. These enzymes act to metabolise the fungal cell wall and have been previously described in Bursaphelenchus spp. Such genes are not usually present in
animals and it was suggested that the Bursaphelenchus
genes were acquired by horizontal gene transfer from bacteria [17].
No such genes are present in root-knot nematodes (for
which two genome sequences are available) or other
Tylenchida. It is possible that a fungal feeding common
ancestor of Aphelenchoidea and Tylenchida possessed
this gene but that more "advanced" plant parasites have
subsequently lost it. Further sequencing within both nematode groups is required to resolve this issue.
All the transcripts potentially encoding pectate lyases were
identified as singletons (Table 4). Two full-length cDNA
sequences of pectate lyases, designated Aa-pel-1 and Aapel-2, were identified from the plasmid clones corresponding to the cluster IDs AAC01649 and AAC03048 respectively. The complete cDNA of Aa-pel-1 was 821 bp in
length and contained an ORF of 247 amino acids with a
putative ATG start codon at position 30 and TAA stop
codon at position 771. A signal peptide of 18 amino acids
is predicted by SignalP [63] at the N-terminus of the putative AA-PEL-1 amino acid sequence. The mature protein
has a predicted molecular mass of 24.250 kDa and theoretical pI of 8.93.
The full-length Aa-pel-2 cDNA was 838 bp long and contained an ORF of 249 bp with an ATG start codon at position 31 and a TAA stop codon at position 778. An Nterminal signal sequence of 19 amino acids predicted by
SignalP [63]. The molecular mass and theoretical pI value
of the putative AA-PEL-2 protein were 24.329 kDa and
9.12 respectively. AA-PEL-1 has 61% identity to AA-PEL-2.
To obtain genomic sequences, the entire coding regions of
Aa-pel-1 and Aa-pel-2 gene were amplified from A. avenae
gDNA using gene specific primers (Table 5). Analysis of
these sequences showed that the Aa-pel-1 and Aa-pel-2
genes were 1,860 and 1,221 bp long respectively from the
ATG to the stop codon. Two introns (468 bp and 651 bp)
were identified in Aa-pel-1 whereas Aa-pel-2 contained
only one intron (690 bp) (Fig. 7). All introns were bordered by canonical cis-splicing sequences [65]. The position of the second intron of Aa-pel-1 was identical to the
intron in Aa-pel-2.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/525

The intron position in the A. avenae genes (Aa-pel-1 and
Aa-pel-2) were compared with other nematode pectate
lyase genes. The pectate lyase genes from Bursaphelenchus
species (Bx-pel-1/2 and Bm-pel-1/2) each have one intron
in their coding region at the same position [18]. This position is also identical to the common intron position of the
A. avenae genes (Fig. 7). Moreover, one of the three
introns of Mi-pel-1 from M. incognita is at the same position as that in the A. avenae and Bursaphelenchus genes. Grpel-1 from G. rostochiensis has six introns and Mi-pel-2
from M. incognita has two introns. Gr-pel-1 and Mi-pel-2
share two intron positions but none of the introns of these
genes have the same position as that in the A. avenae genes
(not shown).
A protein homology search using the deduced amino acid
sequences of AA-PEL-1 and AA-PEL-2 using BLASTP indicated high similarity to the pectate lyases belonging to the
the polysaccharide lyase family 3 (PL3) from plant parasitic nematodes, bacteria and fungi. Multiple sequence
alignment of AA-PEL-1 and AA-PEL-2 with the best
matches confirmed that both A. avenae sequences contained the four highly conserved regions characteristic of
PL3 pectate lyases in bacteria and fungi as well as 8-10
cysteine residues and four charged residues (Fig. 7) that
are potentially involved in catalysis [26,68]. AA-PEL-1 and
AA-PEL-2 were most similar to the pectate lyases (BXPEL1/2 and BM-PEL1/2) from the pinewood nematodes
B. xylophilus and B. mucronatus (52 to 59% identity for the
AA-PEL-1 and 53 to 63% identity for AA-PEL-2) [18]. A.
avenae sequences shared 23 to 33% identity with pectate
lyases (MI-PEL-1, MI-PEL-2, MJ-PEL-1 and GR-PEL-1)
from cyst and root-knot plant parasitic nematode spp
[28,29], and 39 to 45% identity with the sequences from
two microbes (Fig. 7).
A phylogenetic tree was generated from an alignment of A.
avenae pectate lyase sequences with selected proteins
belonging to PL3 from bacteria, fungi, and nematodes
using the maximum likelihood method (Fig. 8). Both Aapel-1 and Aa-pel-2 were clustered with the Bursaphelenchus
genes. Other nematode sequences were not monophyletic
but were clustered into distinct clades.
The pectate lyase genes from A. avenae are more similar to
the Bursaphelenchus genes compared to those from cyst
and root-knot nematodes (Figs. 7 and 8). The identical
position of the common intron of the A. avenae genes (Aapel-1 and Aa-pel-2) and introns within pectate lyase genes
from Bursaphelenchus and M. incognita (Fig. 7) suggests
that pectate lyase genes from a wide range of plant parasitic nematodes have the same origin. To determine which
A. avenae cells express GHF5 endoglucanases and pectate
lyases, in situ mRNA hybridisation was performed (Fig. 9).

As a part of the complex process of parasitism, a wide
range of plant parasitic nematodes use endogenous β-1,4endoglucanases and pectate lyases to degrade two abundant constituents of the plant cell wall and thus facilitate
their migration through host tissues. The presence of signal peptides in the deduced amino acid sequences of the
endoglucanases and pectate lyase from A. avenae coupled
with their expression in the esophageal glands suggest that
both enzymes have a similar role in A. avenae. The presence of such genes in A. avenae suggests that this nematode can enter and migrate through plant tissues and may
also be able to feed on plant cell contents. This is backed
up by the observation that A. avenae is known to feed on
plant tissue in culture [13,14]. A. avenae may therefore
have a wide ranging diet that includes fungi and plant tissues. This, coupled with the position of this nematode as
a basal member of a clade that includes a wide range of
plant parasitic nematodes, provides further support for
the idea that plant parasitism has evolved from fungal
feeding and suggests that A. avenae, may be a very primitive plant feeder.

Conclusion
The 5,076 ESTs identified in this study represent the first
attempt to define the A. avenae gene set and represents
over 2,200 genes. This collection of ESTs represents a starting point for studies in a number of different fundamental
and applied areas. A summary of the assignment of nonredundant ESTs to functional categories as well as their
relative abundance are listed and discussed. A substantial
number of putative Aphelenchus-specific genes were found
that do not share similarity with known genes and some
of these may be highly expressed, based on their abundance in the EST dataset. The presence of genes encoding
a battery of cell-wall-degrading enzymes in A. avenae and
their similarities with the genes from other plant parasitic
nematodes suggest that this nematode can act not only as
a fungal feeder but also as a plant parasite. The gene structures of GHF5 cellulase and PL3 pectate lyase from A. avenae, their phylogenetics and comparative analyses with
similar genes from other parasitic nematodes provides
information that helps understand the evolutionary origins of these genes within the Nematoda. Further studies
on genes encoding cell-wall-degrading enzymes in A. avenae will accelerate our understanding of the complex evolutionary histories of plant parasitism and the use of genes
obtained by horizontal gene transfer from prokaryotes.

Methods
Biological material
The AaF1 isolate of A. avenae was cultured on fungi, Botrytis cinerea for 2-3 weeks at 25°C and then extracted for 3 h
at 25°C using the modified Baermann funnel technique
[69]. Separated, mixed life stage, nematodes were cleaned
by flotation on a 30% (wt/vol) sucrose solution followed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/525

by three washes with 0.5× PBST [70]. Nematodes were
stored at -80°C until use.
Isolation of total RNA, cDNA synthesis and cDNA library
construction
Total RNA from mixed stage A. avenae was isolated using
Sepasol (Nakalai). Analysis of the total RNA on a denaturing agarose gel showed a smear from 50 to 3,000 bp with
two distinct bands of ribosomal RNA. Poly(A)+ RNA was
extracted from total RNA using a FastTrack® MAG micro
mRNA Isolation Kit (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized
using the SMART PCR cDNA amplification method
(Clontech) with a NotI oligo-dT primer (5'
AACTGGAAGAATTCGCGGCCGCAGGAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT). SalI/SmaI adaptors (Takara)
were added to double stranded cDNA which was digested
with NotI and size fractionated using a cDNA Size Fractionation Column to remove small cDNA (< 500 bp)
(Invitrogen). The appropriate fractions containing cDNA
were pooled and ethanol precipitated. Inserts were directionally cloned into NotI and SalI sites of the pSPORT1
vector, and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α cells.
The cDNA library was designated as Aamk.
EST generation
Individual transformants (n = 5,472) from the plasmid
library were picked into 96 well plates containing 0.5 ml
of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Plates
were incubated overnight at 37°C. A small aliquot of each
culture was stored at -80°C after being mixed with same
volume of 25% glycerol in LB. Plasmid DNA was isolated
and purified using FB glass fiber plates (Millipore) using
the glass bead method described in [71]. cDNA inserts
were sequenced from the 5' end using the M13-T7 primer
(5'-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3') and the BigDye terminator ver. 3.1 kit (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI 3100
DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Raw sequence trace
data from the 3100 sequencer were processed in an automated pipeline, the trace2dbEST package [72]. Before submitting them to the public database (DDBJ), sequences
were processed to assess quality, remove vector sequence,
contaminants and cloning artifacts and to identify BLAST
similarities.
Clustering and sequence analysis
Clustering was performed using PartiGene, a software
pipeline designed to analyze and organize EST data sets
[72]. Sequences were clustered into groups (putative
genes) on the basis of sequence similarity using CLOBB
[73]. Clusters were assembled to yield consensus
sequences using Phrap (P. Green, unpublished data).
Each consensus sequence was subjected to BLAST analysis
against the GenBank non-redundant protein database.

Unrooted phylogenetic tree of selected polysaccharide lyase family 3 proteins generated using maximum likelihood analysis. The PL3 proteins from A. avenae (AA-PEL-1 and AA-PEL-2) are labeled in bold. GenBank accession numbers
of PL3 proteins from Bursaphelenchus mucronatus (BM-PEL-1 and BM-PEL-2), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (BX-PEL-1 and BX-PEL2), Meloidogyne incognita (MI-PEL-1, MI-PEL-2 and MI-PEL-3), Meloidogyne javanica (MJ-PEL), Globodera rostochiensis (GR-PEL-1
and GR-PEL-2), Heterodera schachtii (HS-PEL-1 and HS-PEL-2), bacteria and fungi are indicated in brackets. The bootstrap values are calculated from 1000 replicates. The scale bar represents 20 substitutions per 100 amino acid positions.

Comparative analyses were performed with cluster
sequences as queries versus multiple databases including
C. elegans Wormpep v.203 protein database [46]. Protein
databases for 'other nematode' and 'non-nematodes' were
generated in-house for similarity searches. The 'other
nematode'database contained all available protein
sequences from nematodes other than C. elegans and A.
avenae as well as nematode ESTs in GenBank (April 30,
2009), translated into peptide sequences (in TBLASTX
analysis). The 'non-nematode' database comprises amino
acid sequences from the complete non-redundant protein
database (April 30, 2009) excluding those from nematodes. Homologues to cluster sequences were identified

via comparisons against WormBase and non-redundant
protein databases using the BLASTX algorithm. The
TBLASTX algorithm with default parameters was used to
compare the A. avenae cluster sequences to ESTs from
other nematodes. Each cluster sequence of A. avenae was
assigned a 'statistically significant' match if the E-value
from the BLAST output of the sequence alignment was <
1e-05. The program SimiTri [48] was used for the comparison (at the amino acid sequence level) of A. avenae cluster
sequences with data in C. elegans, other nematode and
non-nematode protein sequence databases, providing a
two dimensional display of relative similarity relationships among the three different datasets. "Fragmentation"

defined as the representation of a single gene by multiple
non-overlapping clusters, was estimated by comparing A.
avenae cluster sequences with C. elegans [39].
Gene ontology (GO)
Cluster sequences were classified into Gene Ontology
functional categories [54] based on BLAST similarities to
known genes in the NCBI Swiss-Prot protein sequence
(Swiss-Prot) and using the BLAST2GO annotation tool
[55,56] with an E-value cut-off of 1e-05 and summarized
according to their biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components. To obtain the complete
GO mapping, a node sequence filter in the GO graph was
used 50 for biological process, 20 for molecular function,
and 20 for the cellular component. The multi-level pie
charts were generated using sequence cut-offs of 140, 50
and 40 for biological process, molecular function and cellular components respectively.
Identification of genes encoding cell-wall-degrading
enzymes and sequence analyses
BLASTX searches against the GenBank database were used
to identify A. avenae clusters encoding potential cell-walldegrading enzymes. To obtain full length sequences of
genes, the plasmid clones from which each of these
sequences were obtained were identified and resequenced both directions using designed primers (Table
5) in order to obtain the full-length cDNA sequences. The
genomic coding region of each cDNA clone was obtained

by PCR amplification from A. avenae genomic DNA, using
pairs of gene-specific primers flanking each open reading
frame. PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy
vector (Promega) and sequenced using standard protocols.
Signal peptide predictions were made using the SignalP
program [63]. Protein theoretical pI and molecular mass
were predicted using the "Compute pI/MW tool" available
at
ExPASy
http://br.expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html.
Sequence alignments were made with a multiple alignment program, MAFFT version 6 http://align.bmr.kyushuu.ac.jp/mafft/software/about.html and output was produced using BOXSHADE 3.21 http://align.bmr.kyushuu.ac.jp/mafft/software/about.html
Phylogenetic analyses
The phylogenetic analyses of the catalytic domains of the
GHF5 proteins and PL3 proteins were performed on the
Phylogeny.fr platform [74] and comprised the following
steps. Sequences were aligned with MAFFT (v. 6) configured for highest accuracy (MAFFT with E-INS-i option).
Prior to the phylogenetic analysis, signal peptide
sequences and other N and C terminal extentions peculiar
to individual taxa were excluded. In total 337 and 249
characters were used for GHF5 endoglucanase and pectate
lyase respectively for phylogenetic anlaysis. The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the maximum likelihood method implemented in the PhyML program (v3.0
aLRT). The JTT substitution model was selected assuming
an estimated proportion of invariant sites (of 0.018) and
4 gamma-distributed rate categories to account for rate
heterogeneity across sites. The gamma shape parameter
was estimated directly from the data (gamma = 1.603).
Reliability for internal branch was assessed using the aLRT
test (SH-Like). Graphical representation and edition of
the phylogenetic tree were performed with TreeDyn
(v198.3).
In situ hybridisation
In situ hybridisation was performed as described previously[75]. PCR products were generated from the plasmid
stocks of the cDNA clones of Aa-eng-1 and Aa-pel-1 using
gene specific primers (Table 5). Sense or antisense stra nds
were labelled with digoxigenin by asymmetric PCR and
hybridised to fixed, permeabilised fragments of mixed
stage A. avenae. After washing to remove unbound probe,
specifically hybridising probe was detected using Alkaline-phosphatase conjugated Anti-Digoxigenin antibody
and NBT/BCIP stock solution (Roche Diagnostics). Specimens were examined with differential interference microscopy (Nikon).

Venn diagram illustrating the distribution of BLAST hits for "other
nematode" (other than C. elegans) specific A. avenae cluster
sequences. Positive hits were identified for the BLASTX and TBLASTX
searches of 137 sequences (Fig. 3) and matches were found in "plant parasitic", "animal parasitic and other", and "free living" nematodes. Thirty
four A. avenae cluster sequences produced significant match (E < 1e-5)
only to sequences from plant parasitic nematodes.
