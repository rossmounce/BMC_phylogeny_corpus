The origin and evolution of ARGFX homeobox loci
in mammalian radiation
Research article

Guang Li1,2 and Peter WH Holland*1

Abstract
Background: Many homeobox genes show remarkable conservation between divergent animal phyla. In contrast, the
ARGFX (Arginine-fifty homeobox) homeobox locus was identified in the human genome but is not present in mouse or
invertebrates. Here we ask when and how this locus originated and examine its pattern of molecular evolution.
Results: Phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses suggest that ARGFX originated by gene duplication from Otx1, Otx2
or Crx during early mammalian evolution, most likely on the stem lineage of the eutherians. ARGFX diverged extensively
from its progenitor homeobox gene and its exons have been functional and subject to purifying selection through
much of placental mammal radiation. Surprisingly, the coding region is disrupted in most mammalian genomes
analysed, with human being the only mammal identified in which the full open reading frame is retained. Indeed, we
describe a transcript from human testis that has the potential to encode the full deduced protein.
Conclusions: The unusual pattern of evolution suggests that the ARGFX gene may encode a functional RNA or
alternatively it may have 'flickered' between functional and non-functional states in the evolutionary history of
mammals, particularly in the period when many mammalian lineages diverged within a relatively short time span.
Background
The homeobox genes comprise a large and diverse gene
superclass characterized by presence of a DNA motif
encoding the homeodomain. Most homeodomain proteins function as transcription factors involved in switching other genes on or off during embryonic development,
cell fate specification and cell differentiation. The pivotal
importance of homeobox genes to animal development is
demonstrated by the fact that mutation or experimental
misexpression can cause dramatic developmental abnormalities or cancers [1-3]. The best known homeobox
genes include Hox, ParaHox, NK, Otx, Pax and Dlx genes
which have been extensively studied in many animal
model systems including mice, zebrafish, nematodes and
Drosophila. Indeed, it was comparison of homeobox
genes between species that led to one of the most striking
findings of twentieth century biology: the remarkable
conservation of homeobox and other developmental patterning genes between very divergent animal phyla [4,5].

Not all homeobox genes are ancient, however, and the
extent of their evolutionary conservation varies considerably. For example, a detailed search for all homeobox loci
in the human genome sequence revealed six novel genes,
DPRX, ARGFX, TPRX1, DUXA, DUXB and LEUTX, each
of which has no orthologue in the mouse genome, nor in
invertebrate genomes [6,7]. It was hypothesized that
these homeobox loci originated relatively recently in evolution and had undergone rapid sequence evolution.
Booth and Holland [6] suggested that DPRX, TPRX1 and
DUXA may have originated by tandem duplication and
extensive sequence divergence from the CRX homeobox
gene (a member of the ancient and conserved Otx gene
family), because TPRX1 is adjacent to CRX and the other
two homeobox genes are just 5.8 Mb and 9.2 Mb distant
in chromosomal region 19q13. The evolution of DUXA
and DUXB was studied by Clapp et al [8] who showed
that these genes originated before mammalian radiation
but have been lost from mouse. In contrast, the origin
and subsequent evolution of the ARGFX locus remains
very unclear. Human ARGFX maps to 3q13 so is not in
the same chromosomal region as CRX, or indeed any
other Paired (PRD) class homeobox gene. The sequence
of its homeodomain assigns ARGFX as a divergent mem-

ber of the PRD class [6], but gives no clear solution to its
mode of origin. In addition, it is not yet certain whether
ARGFX is a true functional gene or a nonfunctional
pseudogene. The existence of two human retrotransposed pseudogenes derived from ARGFX, three ESTs
from human testis tumor and a weakly positive RT-PCR
amplification from human testis and embryonic stem
cells indicates a low level of ARGFX transcription in
humans [6]. Here we undertake a comparative study of
ARGFX sequences in vertebrate genomes to investigate
the origin, the patterns of mutation and gene loss, and the
extent of evolutionary conservation of this locus.

Results and Discussion
Human ARGFX gene and transcript

Although human AGRFX has been shown to be weakly
expressed in human testis and ES cells [6], the full transcript has not been previously cloned or experimentally
verified. Indeed, only one of the four predicted intron
positions in the human ARGFX was originally verified
from cDNA (intron 4); the other three intron positions
were predicted by sequence comparison to two retroposed pseudogenes deduced to be derived from ARGFX
[6]. We therefore designed a range of ARGFX-specific
forward and reverse primers and conducted RT-PCR and
RACE PCR on human testis RNA. 5' RACE PCR was
unsuccessful, but 3' RACE generated a product that was
polyadenylated approximately 30 nucleotides downstream from the predicted stop codon. This termination
may be artificial or an alternative polyadenylation site; we
note that it is preceded by a canonical AATAAA polyadenylational signal. RT-PCR using forward and reverse
gene-specific primers successfully amplified from exon 1
to exon 5, verifying that all four predicted introns are
faithfully spliced out in a processed human RNA product
(Figure 1). The assembled sequence has the potential to
code for a protein of 315 amino acids including a 60
amino acid homeodomain. We conclude that the original
annotation was correct, at least across the putative cod-

ing region of the ARGFX locus. This annotation includes
the unusual exon 3 noted by Booth and Holland [6] which
is comprised from the 'right arm' of an Alu element.
Interestingly, the transcriptional direction of the ARGFX
locus is opposite to that expected for parental Alu elements; this is consistent with the finding of Gal-Mark et
al. [9] that most exonizations of Alu elements occur in the
right arms of antisense Alu elements.
Since the ARGFX mRNA is present at very low levels,
we suspected that detection of a protein product would
be difficult. We carried out western blots on human testis
total protein using a commercial polyclonal antibody and
detected a single band of 50 kDa (data not show); this is
much larger than the expected 36 kDa. The size discrepancy suggests the band is artefactual and may reflect the
fact that the antibody was raised to the whole protein
including the Alu region. We note that exonized coding
Alu elements are also found in several proteins; examples
include DSERG1 (GeneID 751816), ZMAT1 (GeneID
84460) and POLR3B (GeneID 55703). In addition, we
searched the PeptideAtlas http://www.peptideatlas.org/
and PRIDE database http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ and
found four matches in the latter. However, these spectra
did not pass the filtering criteria used, and thus do not
provide conclusive evidence for translation of human
ARGFX gene.
The evolutionary origin of ARGFX sequences

The ARGFX locus was first identified in the human
genome, but no homologous sequence was found in
mouse, even though the syntenic region is readily identified [6]. To trace the origin of ARGFX, we searched a wide
phylogenetic range of vertebrate genome sequences using
tblastn. We detected ARGFX-related sequences in many,
but not all, placental mammals (Figure 2; Additional file
1). ARGFX-related sequences with or without predicted
introns were identified in chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan,
rhesus macaque, marmoset, tarsier, mouse lemur, bushbaby, tree shrew, squirrel, guinea pig, rabbit, pika, horse,

cat, dolphin, alpaca, cow, megabat, shrew, elephant, tenrec and armadillo. No closely similar matches were
detected in mouse, rat, dog, non-placental mammals
(opossum and platypus) or non-mammalian vertebrates
(or indeed invertebrates),
To further refine these results, we used a more sensitive
method that exploited the fact that ARGFX has readily
recognized flanking genes within an easily identified syntenic region. Starting with the human ARGFX genomic
region, we were able to identify the corresponding
genomic region in virtually all placental mammals, plus
opossum (a non-placental mammal) and a frog (Xenopus
tropicalis). We then used mVISTA to search these regions
at low stringency for any sequences related to human
ARGFX. In neither opossum nor frog was there detectible
ARGFX-related sequence in the corresponding region.
The locus was also missing from the syntenic region of
mouse, rat and dog.

By combining the sequence similarity searching and the
synteny analyses with a probable phylogenetic tree of the
vertebrates, we can deduce the likely date of evolutionary
origin of ARGFX homeobox loci (Figure 2). The absence
of the locus in mouse, rat and dog clearly reflects secondary loss, since these species are nested within the tree of
placental mammals. The minimal inclusive clade containing taxa possessing ARGFX sequences encompasses
Xenarthra, Afrotheria, Supraprimates and Laurasiatheria.
In contrast, there is no evidence that ARGFX sequences
existed before the origin of placental mammals. We propose, therefore, that ARGFX originated after the divergence of Eutheria from Metatheria.
The human ARGFX gene has similar exon-intron
organisation to the human OTX1, OTX2 and CRX genes
as depicted in Figure 3. The latter three genes are part of a
gene family, Otx, which is well conserved across the
Metazoa. Although human ARGFX gene has an additional coding exon compared to the three Otx genes, this

derives from an Alu element (see above) and we find this
is not present in the predicted tree shrew and megabat
ARGFX genes (Figure 3). This is consistent with the
observation that Alu elements are primate-specific repetitive sequences [10]. In addition to similar gene organisation, we also detected patches of shared sequence
similarity in exons and surrounding genomic regions
between ARGFX and the three canonical Otx genes (Figure 4). A phylogenetic analysis using complete predicted
protein sequences reflects this, as it groups ARGFX with
OTX1, OTX2 and CRX (ML 97% bootstrap; Bayesian 1.0
support value; Figure 5). One possibility is that ARGFX
originated by gene duplication from one of the three
canonical vertebrate Otx genes, on the stem lineage of the
eutherian mammals. If this occurred, it must have been
followed by extensive sequence divergence because the
human ARGFX homeodomain shares only 55% to 56.7%
amino acid sequence identity with human Otx family
genes over 60 amino acids (genes within a homeobox
gene family generally share 70 to 100% homeodomain
amino acid identity [7,11]).
If ARGFX did originate as proposed, it is not clear
which Otx gene was the progenitor, since ARGFX is on a
different chromosome to all three candidates. Interest-

ingly, the canonical Otx genes share more sequence similarity with ARGFX than they do with DPRX and TPRX1
which are located close to CRX chromosomally (Figure
4).
If we accept the proposal that ARGFX is a duplicate
either of CRX, OTX1 or OTX2, then the vertebrate Otx
gene family comprises four genes (or indeed more, if
TPRX1 and DPRX originated by a similar mode). The
number four is interesting because it is now clear that
two rounds of whole genome duplication (2R) occurred
in early vertebrate evolution [12,13]. These events
expanded each ancestral chordate gene to a complement
of four, before subsequent gene losses. Although we
hypothesize that ARGFX originated on the stem lineage
of the eutherian mammals, it is also worth testing an
alternative hypothesis that ARGFX is actually the 'cryptic'
fourth Otx paralogue dating to the much more ancient 2R
genome duplications. Such a hypothesis would predict
that the three canonical Otx genes, plus ARGFX, map to a
fourfold paralogy region in the human genome, homologous to a single chromosomal region in amphioxus. To
test this we identified 24 genes neighbouring the
amphioxus Otx gene (scaffold 8; B. floridae genome

trees. Examining their chromosomal locations revealed
that most human orthologues are distributed on four
human chromosomes (2, 10, 11, 14), three of which

accommodate OTX1, OTX2 and CRX, plus a smaller
number on chromosome 1 (possibly reflecting breakage
of a fourfold paralogy region; Figure 6). In contrast, only
one human orthologue (BOC) was found on chromosome
3, the location of ARGFX. This result implies that while

human orthologues, which map primarily to chromosomes 1, 2, 14, 11 and 19, not chromosome 3. Amphioxus genes are shown in their physical order,
and are numbered as in amphioxus (B. floridae) genome assembly v. 1.0. GeneID 20 is amphioxus Otx. GeneID 22 and 23 are most likely two parts of
a gene and are treated as one locus. Human orthologues are not necessarily in order. Amphioxus genes 2 and 19 (black boxes) do not have clear human homologues; phylogenetic relationships are not well resolved for amphioxus genes 8, 17 and 24 (grey boxes). Human orthologues of amphioxus
gene 13 do not map to on the five main chromosomal regions.

OTX1, OTX2 and CRX were generated by two rounds of
genome duplication in early vertebrate evolution, ARGFX
was not.
In summary, we propose that ARGFX originated after
the divergence of Eutheria from Metatheria. This view is
strongly supported by the phylogenetic distribution of
ARGFX sequences in mammals and by analysis of the
ARGFX syntenic region in placental and marsupial mammals and an amphibian. An alternative hypothesis, that
the origin of ARGFX dates to genome duplication events
in early vertebrate evolution, gains no support from paralogy analysis. It is likely, therefore, that the eutherian
mammal ARGFX locus originated by gene duplication
from CRX, OTX1 or OTX2, followed by extensive
sequence divergence from these conserved Otx genes.
Mutation in placental mammals

Although ARGFX-related sequences were identified in
most placental mammals examined, we were surprised to
find that each one carried critical sequence mutations
when compared to the human ARGFX open reading
frame. In no case did a non-human ARGFX locus contain
an intact open reading frame of equivalent length to the
human sequence (Figure 1), and hence we conclude that
none can code for a functional protein. Furthermore,
each lineage of mammals has different disabling mutations (Additional file 2). For example, within the primates, chimpanzee and gorilla have the start codon ATG
mutated to ACG, in orangutan the stop codon TGA is

mutated to TCA causing termination four codons further
downstream, macaque has a four base-pair insertion
causing a frameshift, and marmoset and mouse lemur
each have different stop codon mutations resulting in a
shorter protein. In other mammals, tree shrew has two
frameshift mutations and one premature stop codon,
guinea pig has four separate frameshift deletions in the Cterminus, cow has a ten base pair deletion at the N-terminus causing a frameshift and a pair of two-nucleotide
deletions at the C-terminus, horse has a one nucleotide
insertion, two premature stop codons and deletions
within the homeobox, while megabat has three frameshift
mutations and a premature stop codon. As already mentioned, mouse, rat and dog have lost the locus secondarily.
These results are particularly surprising when considered in relation to the phylogenetic tree of mammals (Figure 2), because the range of species in which mutation of
the ARGFX locus is found do not form a monophyletic
group to the exclusion of humans. There are several possible explanations for this unusual pattern. First, ARGFX
may be a non-functional pseudogene in all mammals, and
the intact open reading frame in humans is simply a stochastic variant of a sequence diverging in a neutral manner. This would imply a single loss of function event soon
after the origin of ARGFX in the eutherians. Second, the
ARGFX locus may have been functional for the entire
evolutionary history of humans, and is still functional,
but has become a pseudogene (or has been lost) in many

Li and Holland BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:182
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/182

independent mammalian lineages. This would imply at
least 10 independent loss of function events in mammalian evolution, if the phylogeny used in Figure 2 is correct.
Third, the gene may have 'flickered' between functional
and non-functional states in the evolutionary history of
mammals. This might imply a smaller number of independent loss of function events, yet selective maintenance of function for at least part of human evolutionary
history. Fourth, the locus may be functional as an RNA
but not as a protein in most mammals.
Signatures of selection in ARGFX evolution

The unusual evolutionary pattern prompted us to reconsider whether human ARGFX locus encodes a functional
gene, or indeed whether ARGFX has ever been functional. Detection of a transcription product from the
locus, or even a putative translation product, is not sufficient evidence; many pseudogenes are transcribed
[14,15]. Finding a human phenotype associated with
mutation of ARGFX would be informative, but so far no
such human condition is known. We therefore addressed
this question from an evolutionary perspective. Two
approaches were employed.
First, we tested whether there were signatures of positive or negative selection pressure in the coding region by
calculating the ratio of numbers of nonsynonymous to
numbers of synonymous substitutions per site, dN/dS
(ω). We used human, chimpanzee and orangutan ARGFX
sequences to facilitate accurate alignment. Among the
three pairwise ω ratios, one is greater than 1.0 and the
other two close to 1.0 (table 1). We then divided the coding region into three parts, N-terminal, homeodomain
and C-terminal, and calculated ω values separately. All
three pairwise ω values for the N-terminal part were
more than 1.0, but ω values for the other two parts are far
below 1.0, suggesting that the N-terminal part has
encountered positive selection while the homeodomain
and C-terminus sequences have been strongly constrained by negative selection. Plotting potential positively selected sites onto the open reading frame revealed
nearly half of them (6/14, posterior probability > 80%) are
in the region coded by the Alu element (data not shown).
To control for the possibility that the Alu element is
affected by evolutionary processes beyond ARGFX functional constraints, we removed the Alu element and recalculated the nonsynonymous to synonymous ratio. As
expected, the ω values for the full sequence dropped significantly and were now below 1.0 (p < 0.05, Z-test).
Taken together, these results argue that human ARGFX is
a functional gene with some sites under positive selection
pressure, but the majority of the sequence is under negative or purifying selection.

The second approach taken was to compare more
widely divergent mammals and examine the extent of
conservation in exonic and intronic sequence. If the gene
has been functional during much of mammalian evolution, we predict that exonic sequence would be more
highly conserved than intronic sequence. Multiple alignments revealed that ARGFX exons (and sequences immediately flanking exons) show much higher conservation
than introns between divergent lineages (Figure 7). Furthermore, the level of conservation is not uniform
between regions of the deduced protein, but is much
higher within the homeodomain than the N-terminal and
C-terminal regions (mean Poisson corrected distance:
0.280 vs 0.851 and 0.461). Among 45 possible pairwise
comparisons between 10 species, all distances for homeodomains are much less than corresponding values for
the N-terminal region and only 8 of them are slightly
greater than corresponding values for the C-terminal
region (Additional file 3). These results indicate that the
coding sequence of the ARGFX homeobox locus, and in
particular the homeobox, has been under purifying selection for much of mammalian evolution.

Conclusion
In this study, we have performed a deep comparative phylogenetic and phylogenomic analysis on the recently
described homeobox locus ARGFX. We present evidence
that this gene originated by gene duplication from Otx1,
Otx2 or Crx during early mammalian evolution. The
most likely origin was on the stem lineage of the eutherian mammals, after their divergence from marsupials
and monotremes, and before the radiation of living placental mammals. The gene diverged extensively in
sequence from its progenitor homeobox gene and was
then subject to purifying selection. This purifying selection was maintained through much of placental mammal
radiation, even though the coding sequence of the locus is
disrupted in most mammalian genomes analysed.
Strangely, human is the only mammal studied to date in
which the full open reading frame is retained, and we suggest that the ARGFX locus is still functional in human.
Indeed, we detected a transcript in human testis that has
the potential to encode the full deduced protein. The
unusual pattern of conservation suggests either that there
have been very many independent losses of function for
this gene in mammalian radiation, or, that the gene
encodes a functional RNA molecule. An alternative
hypothesis is that the gene has 'flickered' between functional and non-functional states in the evolutionary history of mammals, particularly during the late Cretaceous
period when many mammalian lineages diverged in a relatively short timespan.

Methods
cDNA cloning of human ARGFX

Human testis total RNA was obtained commercially from
AMS Biotechnology Ltd. (Cat. No. R1234260-50), and
used to synthesize cDNA using a SMART RACE kit
(Clontech Laboratories Inc.). Based on open reading
frame predictions made from genomic DNA, gene-specific primers were used to amplify and clone ARGFX
cDNA covering the complete predicted open reading.
Forward primers used were: H.sa-ARGFX-F1 (CACGTAGGACTGAAAATGGTTACTC in exon 1) and
HsARGFX-51F (CGGAGAAGGCATAAAGAACG in
exon 4). Reverse primer was HsARGFX-51Rm
(AGGGTCTAAGGGCTGAGATGG in exon 5). Primer
positions are shown in Figure 1. To examine whether the
transcribed mRNA is translated, western blots were performed using human ARGFX polyclonal antibody
(Abcam Inc., Cat. no. ab67562) and human testis total
protein (AMS Biotechnology, Cat. no. P1234260).

Initially, we focused attention on nineteen vertebrate
genome sequences of high quality in Ensembl (release 56)
accessible at http://www.ensembl.org/index.html, comprising ten mammals (chimpanzee, orangutan, rhesus
macaque, mouse, rat, dog, cow, horse, opossum, platypus), two birds (chicken, zebra finch), one reptile (anole
lizard), one amphibian (Xenopus tropicalis) and five
teleost fish (Tetraodon, Takifugu, medaka, stickleback,
zebrafish). Genomes were searched using tblastn [16]
with human ARGFX deduced protein sequence as the
query and an E-value cutoff of 1e-5. Many partial genome
sequences were also searched. In cases where no match
was detected, this can be due either to incomplete
sequencing, complete absence or to partial degeneration.
To distinguish between these possibilities, we identified
the region of each genome assembly syntenic to the
human ARGFX location and searched this for short
degenerated sequences related to ARGFX using the
LAGAN program [17] implemented in mVISTA http://
genome.lbl.gov/vista/mvista/submit.shtml with a match
criterion of 50% identity over 50bp. All sequences used in
analysis are included in Additional file 1.
Phylogenetic analysis

Nucleotide sequences and deduced protein sequences
were aligned using CLUSTAL_X [18]. NJ (Neighbor-Joining) trees [19] were calculated using MEGA4 [20] using
the Kimura 2-parameter distance estimation for nucleotide sequences and Poisson distance estimation for protein sequences [21]. ML (maximum likelihood) trees were
constructed using PHYML [22] using the JTT model,
estimated to be the most appropriate model by ProtTest
[23]. The reliability of interior nodes in ML and NJ tree
was assessed by bootstrapping with 100 replications [24].
Bayesian trees were constructed using MrBayes 3.1 with
1.2 million cycles and sampling 1/10 of trees after a
30,000 cycle burn-in [25]. Deduced protein sequences
used for ARGFX trees were human ARGFX (without the
region encoded by the Alu element), NP_001012677, and
the thirteen most similar human proteins according to
blastp: human CRX, NP_000545; human OTX2,
NP_068374; human OTX1, NP_055377; human UNCX,
NP_001073930; human ALX1, NP_008913; human
PHOX2B, NP_003915; human PAX6, NP_001595; human
DRGX, NP_001073989; human DMBX1, NP_671725;
human ALX4, NP_068745; human PHOX2A,
NP_005160; human VSX1, NP_055403; human ALX3,
NP_006483. Numbers of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) per site were calculated using the modified
Nei-Gojobori Jukes-Cantor method [26] implemented in
MEGA4. Potential positive selected sites were determined using codeml program in PAML 4 package [27].
Alignments of genome sequences were undertaken using
