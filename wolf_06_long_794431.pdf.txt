Abstract
Background: The interpandemic evolution of the influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein is commonly considered a paragon of
rapid evolutionary change under positive selection in which amino acid replacements are fixed by virtue of their effect on antigenicity,
enabling the virus to evade immune surveillance.
Results: We performed phylogenetic analyses of the recently obtained large and relatively unbiased samples of the HA sequences
from 1995–2005 isolates of the H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes of influenza A virus. Unexpectedly, it was found that the evolution of H3N2
HA includes long intervals of generally neutral sequence evolution without apparent substantial antigenic change ("stasis" periods) that
are characterized by an excess of synonymous over nonsynonymous substitutions per site, lack of association of amino acid
replacements with epitope regions, and slow extinction of coexisting virus lineages. These long periods of stasis are punctuated by
shorter intervals of rapid evolution under positive selection during which new dominant lineages quickly displace previously coexisting
ones. The preponderance of positive selection during intervals of rapid evolution is supported by the dramatic excess of amino acid
replacements in the epitope regions of HA compared to replacements in the rest of the HA molecule. In contrast, the stasis intervals
showed a much more uniform distribution of replacements over the HA molecule, with a statistically significant difference in the rate
of synonymous over nonsynonymous substitution in the epitope regions between the two modes of evolution. A number of parallel
amino acid replacements – the same amino acid substitution occurring independently in different lineages – were also detected in
H3N2 HA. These parallel mutations were, largely, associated with periods of rapid fitness change, indicating that there are major
limitations on evolutionary pathways during antigenic change. The finding that stasis is the prevailing modality of H3N2 evolution
suggests that antigenic changes that lead to an increase in fitness typically result from epistatic interactions between several amino acid
substitutions in the HA and, perhaps, other viral proteins. The strains that become dominant due to increased fitness emerge from
low frequency strains thanks to the last amino acid replacement that completes the set of replacements required to produce a
significant antigenic change; no subset of substitutions results in a biologically significant antigenic change and corresponding fitness
increase. In contrast to H3N2, no clear intervals of evolution under positive selection were detected for the H1N1 HA during the
same time span. Thus, the ascendancy of H1N1 in some seasons is, most likely, caused by the drop in the relative fitness of the
previously prevailing H3N2 lineages as the fraction of susceptible hosts decreases during the stasis intervals.
Conclusion: We show that the common view of the evolution of influenza virus as a rapid, positive selection-driven process is, at
best, incomplete. Rather, the interpandemic evolution of influenza appears to consist of extended intervals of stasis, which are
characterized by neutral sequence evolution, punctuated by shorter intervals of rapid fitness increase when evolutionary change is
driven by positive selection. These observations have implications for influenza surveillance and vaccine formulation; in particular, the
possibility exists that parallel amino acid replacements could serve as a predictor of new dominant strains.

Background
The antigenic variability of Type A influenza virus is the
basis for the recurring epidemics that claim hundreds of
thousands of human lives globally each year [1]. Unlike
most pathogens where exposure leads to lasting immunity
in the host, influenza A virus presents a moving antigenic
target, evading specific immunity triggered by previous
infections. This process, called antigenic drift, is the result
of the selective fixation of mutations in the gene encoding
the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, the major target for the
host immune response[2]. Hemagglutinin variants that
best escape the host immune response are thought to have
a significant reproductive advantage [3].
Although less common than antigenic drift, antigenic shift
is considered another major force in the evolution of
influenza viruses[2,3]. Antigenic shift occurs when the
virus acquires an HA of a different influenza subtype via
reassortment of one or more gene segments and is
thought to be the basis for the more devastating influenza
pandemics that occurred several times in the last century[4]. There have been three pandemics in the last hundred years: in 1918 (H1N1 subtype), 1957 (H2N2
subtype), and in 1968 (H3N2 subtype). During each of
these pandemics, the new virus drove the previous pandemic subtype out of circulation. In 1977, the H1N1 subtype reappeared, albeit with a lower virulence than both
the original H1N1 of the 1918–1956 period and the
H3N2 subtype, and since then has been co-circulating
with H3N2 [3,4].
In some seasons, the Type A influenza cases are primarily
due to H3N2, the predominant subtype circulating in
humans since 1969. In other seasons, however, the H1N1
subtype predominates (c.f. [5]). Reassortment of influenza gene segments also occurs within co-circulating lineages of the same subtype, providing an additional
mechanism for generating diversity during the interpandemic evolution of the virus [6,7]. In particular, intra-subtype reassortment was responsible for generating the 2003
Fujian-type antigenic strain [8,9], demonstrating the epidemiological significance of this phenomenon.
The observations of extremely rapid evolution of influenza A, especially in the HA gene, has led to the suggestion
that the evolution of the surface regions of the HA is
driven by continual positive selection. In particular, Ratner et al., in a phylogenetic analysis of human H3 subtype

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/34

HA genes, found a significantly higher rate of amino acid
replacements than silent changes in antigenic positions of
the HA1 domain (which consists of the N-terminal 329
residues of HA and includes the epitopes recognized by
the immune system) as compared to the same rates (or
rate ratios) for the C-terminal HA2 domain [10]. These
findings of apparent positive selection in the HA gene
were further supported and extended in similar studies by
Fitch et al. [11] and Ina and Gojobori [12]. It has been
emphasized that the phylogenetic tree for the HA1 of
H3N2 isolates has a distinct, "ladder-like" shape, with a
prominent trunk (the path from the root to the base of the
latest included cluster of isolates) and, typically, short side
branches [11].
More recently, Bush et al. performed an in-depth study of
357 nucleotide sequences of the HA1 domain of the HA
gene from human H3N2 subtype influenza virus isolated
between 1983 and 1997 [13]. This study supported earlier
findings of positive selection for those amino acid positions involved in receptor and antibody binding and,
more specifically, for a subset of 18 amino acid sites in
HA1. In addition, Bush et al. found that 9 of these 18 positions showed evidence of positive selection only in the
internal branches and not the terminal branches (i.e. the
tips) of a phylogenetic tree generated from the entire set of
HA1 sequences. Given this bias, it has been proposed that
these positions would be useful in predicting future dominant epidemic variants [13]. This, and other efforts to
improve prediction of epidemic strains [14] are deemed
important for improving influenza vaccine formulation
because the closer the vaccine strain is to the dominant
variant, the more effective the vaccine [3].
Most influenza gene sequencing is done as part of international surveillance programs whose focus on identifying
serologically novel strains results in biased samples of the
viral population [14,15]. The Influenza Genome Sequencing Project, funded and managed by the US National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has recently
generated over 1000 fully sequenced influenza genomes
from clinical isolates obtained between 1995 and 2005
and publicly available in Genbank [16]. One goal of this
project was to provide researchers with a large set of
sequenced isolates that represent a relatively unbiased,
i.e., not enriched in antigenically novel isolates, view of
influenza strains in the population [17]. We analyzed this
data set along with other currently available H3N2 and
H1N1 sequences to further refine our understanding of
the interpandemic evolution of influenza A virus, the relative role of positive selection versus random genetic drift
in HA, and the implications for epidemic surveillance.

Results
Figure 1 shows juxtaposed evolutionary trees of human
H3N2 HA and PA (polymerase) genes, with colored shading connecting HA and PA tree partitions comprised of
gene segments from the same clinical isolate. The PA gene
was chosen as a control to the HA because it encodes an
internal viral protein and is among the viral genes that are
the least likely to be subject to substantial positive selection. As is generally seen in similar comparisons, gene segments roughly cluster by the sampling date. However, the
temporal ordering of the Sydney isolates (1997–2002) is
somewhat indistinct, with, for example, the dominant isolates of 2001 being derived from 1998 isolates rather than
the dominant isolates of 2000 or 1999. Associated with
this is a major branching of the PA tree with one subtree
comprised of isolates primarily from 2001–2003 and
another subtree with isolates from 1999 and 2002–2005.
While the HA and PA trees are generally consistent, the
lack of clear temporal succession in the HA tree during the
"Sydney" antigenic period, along with the bifurcation of
the PA tree, results in a HA/PA inconsistency, or apparent
"crossing" for isolates from 1999–2000 (Figure 1)). A
more dramatic inconsistency, however, is seen in the
Fujian antigenic interval associated with the reassortment
noted by Barr et al. and Holmes et al. [8,9]. As seen in Figure 1, the Fujian strain was first observed in Europe and
Southeast Asia in 2002 and in New York state in April,
2003, which was an H1-dominant influenza season in the
US, and appears more closely related to dominant strains
from 1998 (denoted here as "Early Sydney") than, for
example, to strains from 2001–2002. The reassortment
event generated a strain with the Early Fujian HA gene segment, but all other gene segments derived from a Late Sydney strain and this reassortant becomes the dominant
strain in 2003–2004 season. Notably, however, this reassortant strain is completely replaced by the non-reassorted
Fujian strain ("late Fujian") from 2004 onwards. This
observation has not been made by Barr et al or Holmes et
al. [8,9] because the relevant data was not available at the
time when these analyses were conducted.
To determine whether positive selection played a substantial role in the evolution of the HA gene during the period
covered by the isolates analyzed, we computed the ratio of
nonsynonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) nucleotide
substitutions per site (ratio dN/dS) for (i) all branches of
the H3N2 HA tree, (ii) for the branches comprising the
trunk lineage only, and (iii) for all non-trunk branches
(Table 1). The results were further subdivided to consider
mutations anywhere in the HA protein, or restricted to the
HA1 domain, the HA2 domain, the epitope regions of the
HA1, and the non-epitope regions of the HA1 (see Methods). In agreement with previous work [10-13,18], there
was a consistent pattern such that the dN/dS ratio was con-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/34

siderably higher in the regions of the protein recognized
by the host immune system (i.e., epitopes > HA1 > HA2)
and in the trunk lineage (i.e., the mutations transmitted to
the subsequent generations). These differences were not
statistically significant but this is, most likely, due to the
small number of substitutions in the currently available
data. Further, only the dN/dS value for the trunk mutations
in the epitope regions was >1, which is considered to be
indicative of positive selection [19]. Although this result
was not statistically significant, most likely, again because
of the small number of mutations in the trunk, it strongly
suggests that positive selection only affected the H3N2
trunk lineages and only the epitope regions of HA.
Because the sample of clinical isolates in the NIAID Influenza Genome Sequencing Project is approximately unbiased – antigenic variants are not preferentially selected –
the relative frequencies of H3N2 lineages over time are
expected to directly reflect fitness differences. Using the
HA tree from Figure 1 as a guide, we divided the H3N2
isolates into distinct lineages based on the trunk branch
from which they derive (Figure 2). We can then assign an
origination date to each lineage based on the earliest date
of any isolate within the group; although this is a conservative estimate, it is consistent across all lineages. With
these assignments of lineages and their origination dates,
we can compare the extinction times of successive lineages
as shown in Figure 3 (see Methods for details). This analysis reveals a sharp distinction between lineages with
short (<6 months) extinction times (green intervals in Figure 3) and those with long (>6 months) extinction times
(red intervals in Figure 3). The most likely explanation of
this pattern is that new lineages with greater advantages in
fitness more rapidly and fully drive older co-circulating
lineages to extinction than new lineages with minimal or
no fitness advantages. The latter lineages tend not to exterminate previously circulating isolates such that these can
reappear in later seasons. Compatible with this explanation, the intervals of rapid extinction (fitness change) are
associated with an excess of nonsynonymous over synonymous substitutions, with the former occurring almost
exclusively in the epitope regions (Figure 3). Specifically,
the ratio of the number of amino acid replacements in
epitopes to the number of replacements in non-epitope
regions was 23:1 for the sum of the rapid extinction intervals (green) and 9:8 for the sum of the slow extinction
intervals (red). The difference between these ratios was
statistically significant, with P = 0.0017 by Fisher's exact
test. Similarly, the ratio of nucleotide substitutions leading to amino acid replacements in the epitopes to all other
substitutions (both synonymous and nonsynonymous)
was 23:24 for the "green" intervals and 9:30 for the red
intervals (P = 0.012 by Fisher's exact test). These findings
strongly suggest that the rapid extinction of virus lineages
is driven by positive selection in the epitope regions of

each new dominant lineage, whereas the intervals of slow
extinction (defined here as "stasis" periods when no
major antigenic changes occur) largely involve neutral or
near-neutral evolution.
An additional distinction between the stasis intervals and
intervals of rapid fitness change became apparent through
the analysis of parallel mutations in HA, i.e., the mutations that occur on the side tree branches in parallel to

those occurring on the main trunk of the tree in approximately the same time period. Altogether, for the 1995–
2005 time interval, parallel replacements were detected in
11 positions of the HA protein (Figure 4). Notably, 7 of
these positions were located in the epitope regions and
nearly all the mutations in these positions mapped to the
putative positive selection intervals discussed above (the
green intervals in Figures 3 and 4). Two of these positions
harbor three parallel mutations each (HA positions 73

and 172) and one position – 242 – has five parallel mutations. Our observation of the same mutations recurring in
multiple lineages is compatible with the notion that each
confers a substantial selective advantage onto the respective lineage, and there are limited fitness trajectories available to viral evolution. This conclusion reverberates with
the results of recent studies on experimental evolution of
enzyme fitness which demonstrated that, among the multitude of possible mutational trajectories, only a small
fraction is accessible to selection [20]. In contrast, the only
parallel mutations that exclusively occurred in periods of
stasis (red intervals) were also the only ones to occur in
non-epitope regions of the HA protein (Figure 4).
In an attempt to obtain independent evidence of periods
of "stasis" in influenza evolution, we examined long-term
epidemiological records, namely, the weekly time series of
Pneumonia and Influenza (P&I) deaths from 1972 to
2002 in US states ([21]). We computed the influenzarelated mortality impact for each season as the number of
P&I deaths above a seasonal baseline. We also calculated
a measure of regional speed of spread for each epidemic,
based on the timing of P&I peaks in each state. The predominant virus subtype was defined for each season by
CDC laboratory surveillance as the subtype(s) representing >75% of influenza specimens collected in the US. A
pattern compatible with stasis was observed in the H3N2
seasons preceding an H1N1 season: these seasons were
associated with significantly slower spread than other
H3N2 seasons (spread index = 5.69 weeks versus 3.60, P
= 0.02 by the Wilcoxon test), and a somewhat lower mortality impact (3.32 P&I excess deaths per 100,000 population versus 4.55, Wilcoxon P = 0.08). Overall, H1N1
seasons were associated with lower mortality impact and
slower spread than H3N2 seasons (mortality index: 1.8
P&I excess deaths per 100,000 in H1N1 seasons versus 4.1
in H3N2 seasons, Wilcoxon P = 0.005; spread index: 7.1
weeks versus 4.4 weeks, P = 0.008). This suggests that
H1N1 is able to out-compete H3N2 only when the epidemiologic fitness of H3N2 lineages declines below a certain
level.
As noted above, most influenza seasons are dominated by
the H3N2 subtype whereas, since 1977, some other sea-

sons were dominated by the milder H1N1 subtype.
Immune cross-protection between different subtypes of
influenza A has been observed [22,23] such that there is
competition between H3N2 and H1N1. During the long
stasis interval spanning 1999–2002, there were two
H1N1-dominant seasons in the US, 2000–2001 and
2002–2003 [5]. Consistent with the surveillance results,
we observed a preponderance of H1N1 isolates in both
the New York and the New Zealand data sets during several intervals between 2000 and 2003 (Figure 3). The transition to H1N1 could be due to either positive selection
leading to increased fitness of H1N1 itself, or to a relative
decrease in H3N2 fitness as a greater proportion of the
host population had been exposed to a relatively static set
of H3N2 strains. The dN/dS analysis of the H1N1 tree,
including the portion corresponding to this interval,
showed no evidence of positive selection (Table 2), and
this was also the case when dN/dS ratios were computed
for each codon independently (data not shown). In
accord with these observations, there was no pattern of
lineage displacement in the H1N1 tree (Figure 5). These
results are consistent with a picture of the general neutral
evolution of the H1N1 strains and suggest that H1N1
took over only due to the drop in the relative fitness of
H3N2.

Discussion
Most studies on the interpandemic evolution of influenza
virus have focused on antigenic drift, in which mutations
in the epitope regions of the HA protein are thought to be
highly favored if they allow the virus to escape the host
immune system [3,11-13]. Under this view, evolution of
the influenza virus HA is, largely, driven by positive selection.
The results described here suggest a very different picture
of HA evolution. Indeed, the most salient feature of H3N2
evolution during the 1994–2005 time interval appears to
be the predominance of neutral sequence evolution manifest in extended periods of antigenic stasis that are not
associated with major fitness change. During these stasis
periods, there is a preponderance of silent nucleotide
changes, and those amino acid replacements that do occur
are not preferentially located in the antigenic regions of

the hemagglutinin, suggesting that they are neutral. Thus,
these amino acid replacements do not seem to affect the
antigenic properties of HA to the extent that would allow
the respective viruses to evade the immune system and,
consequently, are not favored by natural selection. Consistent with the excess of neutral mutations during the
intervals of stasis, displacement of pre-existing lineages by
new strains is slow, again suggesting that they only differ
minimally in fitness.
We therefore propose that, during periods of stasis, any
antigenic novelty is insufficient to yield substantial fitness
advantages for competing H3N2 strains. Consequently,
the absolute fitness of the H3N2 variants drops as the density of susceptible hosts gradually decreases. Hence,
although the H1N1 subtype also seems to be evolving
neutrally, its relative fitness increases as an increasing
number of individuals who have not been exposed to
H1N1 enter the population. Ultimately, the fitness trajectories of the H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes cross, such that
H1N1 was able to out-compete H3N2 in 2000 and 2002.
Although we do not have sufficient sequence data to
extend this analysis prior to 1995, the epidemiologic
observations of decreased speed of spread and, possibly,
decreased excess mortality for H3N2-years immediately
prior to H1N1 years suggest that periods of stasis have
always been a feature of the interpandemic evolution of
the H3N2 subtype.
The intervals of stasis in influenza A virus evolution are
punctuated by periods of apparent rapid change in fitness
(owing primarily to antigenic innovation), which are
associated with an excess of nonsynonymous mutations
in epitope regions of HA and the rapid displacement of
old lineages by new dominant ones. The high frequency
of parallel mutations during intervals of rapid fitness
change indicates both that the virus is able to rapidly
explore the adaptive landscape, fixing antigenically favorable mutations, and that there are a limited number of
pathways across the adaptive landscape. Thus, the observation that the H3N2 virus was in stasis for most of the
1995–2005 time interval suggests that for much of this
time the HA gene was more than a single mutational step
away from a significant increase in fitness. In other words,
from a given HA sequence, several mutations seem to be
required to yield an antigenically distinct HA, and little or
no fitness advantage is conferred by any subset of these
mutations – a form of epistasis. Consequently, new dominant strains are likely to often emerge as a result of a single mutation of pre-existing low frequency (and low
fitness) strains, a pattern that is clear from examination of
Figure 1.
Compelling evidence for this type of epistatic interaction
between amino acids in the influenza hemagglutinin has

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/34

been obtained in a study on the effect of HA mutagenesis
on its hemabsorption properties [24]. Consistent with
this, Smith et al. noted that some mutations caused much
greater antigenic change than others, i.e., that the longterm rate of antigenic change was less uniform than the
rate of genetic evolution [18]. A major role of synergistic
epistasis in virus evolution of has been convincingly demonstrated also for other RNA viruses including HIV
[25,26] and vesicular stomatitis virus [27]. From a more
general evolutionary standpoint, these results are consistent with the notion that neutral mutations provide essential material for subsequent evolutionary innovation [2831].
The great majority of influenza isolates analyzed here
come either from New York State or from New Zealand,
and in particular, all the results on extinction times were
obtained with isolates from these locations. Thus, the
sample is geographically limited, although both the
Northern and the Southern hemispheres are represented.
However, the observation on extended periods of stasis
described here is highly unlikely to be an artifact of
incompleteness in the data, especially as the genetic diversity of influenza virus in New York State is representative
of that on the global scale [9] and that viruses sampled
from New York State or New Zealand are intermingled on
our phylogenetic trees. Moreover, recently, it has been
shown that epidemics in New York State are seeded by the
seasonal importation of multiple lineages of influenza
viruses, rather than local strains persisting during the summer, suggesting that this dataset provides a good sample
of the global diversity of influenza viruses [32]. Additionally, such a hypothetical, "missing", positively selected
branch would have had to go extinct despite its high fitness, otherwise it would appear in our analysis of the
trunk isolates.
The observations described here, along with several previous ones, suggest that interpandemic evolution of influenza virus is a highly complex, multifaceted process in
which reassortment, as observed in the emergence of
Fujian-like viruses [8,9], played an important role. Critically, however, our results indicate that viral fitness does
not solely depend on antigenic novelty. A shown in Figure
1, the Fujian strain first appeared in 2002 from a low frequency predecessor that first diverged from the Sydney
strain, probably, in 1998. The experiments of Jin et al [33]
indicate that the amino acid replacement in position 171
resulted in a major change in antigenicity from the then
prevailing strains, and this change was further enhanced
by the replacement in position 172. The three parallel
mutations observed in position 172 (Figure 4) corroborate the selective value of this replacement and are consistent with the experimental results. However, the antigenic
novelty of the 2002 early Fujian strain notwithstanding, it

Page 10 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:34

was only a minor H3N2 variant during an H1N1 dominant season. That the HA of this virus was able to confer a
significant fitness advantage onto the reassortant virus
suggests that the early Fujian strain carried deleterious
mutations elsewhere in its genome that counteracted the
fitness advantages from the antigenically novel HA. By
2004, however, the "pure" Fujian had out-competed the
reassortant virus, most likely because of subsequent compensatory mutations. It is also conceivable that the reassortant, although benefiting from the antigenic novelty of
the Fujian HA gene, also suffered some disadvantages or
incompatibilities. For example, it has been suggested that
the HA and NA of the reassortant had mismatched
hemagglutinin and neuraminidase specificities [34].
These results have implications for influenza surveillance
and vaccine formulation. Accurate prediction of the dominant strain during intervals of rapid fitness change is
expected to be extremely challenging. Since fitness differences among strains are small during stasis, there could be
many genetically distinct clades at low frequency in the
population that are initially indistinguishable by serological surveillance. While we do not currently have methods
to predict which of these variants are one mutational step
away from an antigenically distinct descendant, there is
ample evidence that these new variants can rapidly
become dominant (e.g., Figures 1 and 3). Presumably,
this was the cause of the vaccine mismatch for the 1997
influenza season which saw the emergence of the Sydney
strain whereas the vaccine recommendation was for a
Wuhan H3N2 strain [35]. The Fujian strain also emerged
from a low frequency clade as discussed above but, perhaps, because of deleterious mutations elsewhere in the
genome, it was not initially dominant. Although the antigenic distinctiveness of Fujian had been noticed [36], this
strain grew poorly in eggs, thus presenting a challenge to
incorporate in the vaccine. Since a significant number of
the H3N2 isolates at that time were still of the Late Sydney
variant, the Sydney strain was retained for vaccine use
[36], leading to a mismatch with the Fujian reassortant
that dominated that year.
Matching the vaccine strain to the dominant strain is particularly challenging during periods of rapid antigenic
change. Furthermore, some of these intervals can be
extremely short, with only a small number of amino acid
replacements (e.g., the short green interval in the 1998–
99 season, with only 4 replacements, shown in Figure 1)
although they are nevertheless associated with significant
changes in fitness. As a case in point, Hardy et al. [37] and
Schweiger et al. ([38] noted new variants becoming dominant during the 1998–1999 season that were distinguishable genetically but not serologically. Because the
hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay was unable to
detect serological novelty with this new variant, the vac-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/34

cine strain choice for the 1999–2000 season was again an
early Sydney strain [39]. Thus, although, on average, the
HI test is a reasonable surrogate for the human immune
response, there might be cases when this test misses epidemiologically relevant serological differences between
influenza isolates.
Consequently, strains that have accumulated amino acid
replacements in epitopic regions and have been shown to
quickly displace co-circulating strains seem to merit attention as potentially epidemiologically significant even in
the absence of indications from the HI test. This study suggests particular retrospective cases in this category that
might be worth additional, detailed serological examination.
Correct prediction of the dominant strain is difficult even
for periods of stasis because of the temporal indistinctness
of the isolate succession (see above). However, the consequences of a mismatch during these intervals are likely to
be less dramatic given the absence of major antigenic
changes.
Considering that the stasis intervals allow the proliferation of low frequency clades, any of which might become
the next dominant strain, sequencing much larger numbers of representative isolates should be helpful in augmenting current surveillance methods. A clade that
persisted for several years at low frequency might warrant
further characterization, especially, considering the history of the Fujian strain. Furthermore, more intense sampling would allow the detection of additional cases of
parallel amino acid replacements, which might be the earliest sign that certain mutations are being fixed by selection and could soon provide significant fitness
advantages. To evaluate potential benefits of deeper sampling of influenza isolates by genomic sequencing, it will
be important to sequence a large number of geographically dispersed isolates from 1996 to determine whether
an increase in parallel mutations presaged the 1997 Sydney epidemic.
Taken together, the findings described here indicate that
interpandemic evolution of influenza A virus involves a
complex interplay between neutral evolution during periods of antigenic stasis, positive selection during relatively
short intervals of rapid change in fitness, and multiple
effects of reassortment. It is notable that analysis of a relatively large and unbiased sample of viral sequences from
multiple seasons with straightforward molecular evolutionary methods yields this unexpectedly complex picture
of virus evolution. To further elaborate and complete this
picture, additional, large-scale sequencing of diverse
influenza virus isolates is critical.

Materials and methods
Sequence data
Our analysis utilized human Influenza A virus data
retrieved from the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource [16]. All
(nearly) full-length protein and coding region (CDS)
sequences (550+ amino acids for HA and 714+ amino
acids for PA) were downloaded and aligned using the
MUSCLE multiple alignment program [40]. CDS
sequences were aligned to match the protein alignments
codon-by-codon. The resulting alignments included 227
H1N1 HA sequences, 994 H3N2 HA sequences and 894
H3N2 PA sequences. The Genbank accession numbers for
all analyzed sequences are available as Supplementary
Material (see Additional File 1)
Phylogenetic analysis
Maximum parsimony trees were reconstructed from the
CDS alignments using the PAUP* program [41] utilizing
subtree pruning-regrafting (SPR) branch-swapping. 50%
majority rule consensus trees (with zero-length branches
collapsed) were used to represent the evolutionary history
of each segment. Each tree was rooted at the cluster of
sequences from the oldest available isolates (1918 for
H1N1 and 1968 for H3N2). The "trunk" of the tree was
defined as the path from the root to the base of the cluster
including the latest (2005) sequences. Mutations were
mapped to individual tree branches using the DNAPARS
program of the PHYLIP package (with consensus maximum parsimony trees supplied to DNAPARS) [42,43].
Analysis of selection pressures
To examine the selection pressures acting on HA we used
a subset of recent (1995–2005) sequences representing all
distinct side branches that were selected using the complete maximum parsimony tree as a guide to the phylogenetic relationships between the isolates. The selected sets
included 100 H3N2 sequences and 20 H1N1 sequences.
A subtree joining the selected sequences, was extracted
from the full-size tree and used as input for the CODEML
program of the PAML package [44,45]. CODEML was
then used to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the
dN/dS ratio per site for the whole tree (basic model [46])
or independently for subsets of branches (e.g. trunk vs.
non-trunk branches, branch model [47].

In addition to the full-length HA sequences, this analysis
was performed with the alignment partitioned into the
HA1 and HA2 segments and into antigenic epitope and
non-epitope sites [48,49]. The sequence coordinates of
the epitope positions were from [48,49] which were
themselves derived from the crystal structure of the HA of
a 1968 Hong Kong isolate of H3N2 (A/Aichi/2/1968)
reported by Wiley et al. [48,49]. These coordinates were
then projected onto the multiple alignment of the HA
protein sequences (see Additional File 1).

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/34

Maximum likelihood reconstructions of ancestral
sequences and individual mutation events, provided by
PAML, were used to cross-validate the maximum parsimony reconstructions.
To estimate the selection pressures acting on the HA gene
from H1N1 in more detail, we inferred codon-specific dN/
dS values using the Single Likelihood Ancestor Counting
(SLAC), Fixed Effects Likelihood (FEL) and Random
Effects Likelihood (REL) methods, all incorporating the
HKY85 substitution models with phylogenetic trees
inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method available at
the Datamonkey facility [50]. No evidence for positive
selection in H1N1 was found under any method.
Extinction of lineages and the tempo and mode of
influenza evolution
Each trunk branch divides the tree (and the set of the terminal nodes) into two parts: one "below" this branch (i.e.
towards the root) and the other one "above" (Figure 2).
Terminal nodes (tips) associated with the proximal partition of the tree represent isolates whose lineages are
bound for extinction; the tips in the distal partition represent isolates descending from the breakpoint branch. The
oldest isolate in the descendant partition of the tree provides the upper bound time estimate for the breakpoint
branch (obviously, the breakpoint branch must predate
the oldest descendant node). The youngest isolate in the
extinct partition of the tree can survive well past the breakpoint. Proximal partition isolates that are younger than
the breakpoint represent the lineages co-existing with the
descendant lineages for some time. The process of extinction of these lineages can be described in terms of the fraction of the lineages that survive past the given time
interval from the breakpoint. Here, we associate each of
the trunk branches with the amount of time that is
required for 90% extinction (10% survival) of the coexisting lineages (Figure 2); similar results were obtained
with 50% or 75% extinction thresholds. Only isolates
with precisely known isolation dates, mostly, those from
the NIAID-funded projects in New York State, USA, and
New Zealand, were used in this analysis. It is reasonable
to assume that rapid displacement of the existing lineages
by the descendants of a particular trunk branch indicates
a highly competitive evolutionary landscape with the isolate replacement driven by positive selection. By contrast,
slow extinction indicates little (if any) difference in fitness
between the co-existing lineages from the proximal and
distal partitions of the tree, i.e., a (nearly) neutral mode of
evolution.

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer's report 1
Ron Fouchier, National Influenza Center and Department of Virology, Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam,
The Netherlands (nominated by Andrey Rzhetsky)

In the manuscript, in particular in the abstract, the authors
refer to phenotype changes while the phenotype is only
INFERRED from genetic data. For instance, antigenic
changes are inferred from amino acid replacements in
proposed epitopes, and changes in virus fitness are
inferred from rapid displacement of existing lineages. It
would be better to stick to the facts; e.g. refer to amino
acid substitutions in antigenic sites rather than antigenic
change and to use the term fitness with more care.
Author response: Antigenic changes are not, exactly, inferred
from changes in the (proposed) epitopes but, of course, when we
notice differential patterns for replacements in the epitope
regions, we believe that it makes sense to interpret these differences as being relevant to the evolution of the virus antigenicity
and fitness. We went through the corresponding language
throughout the paper and made minor changes, in particular,
in the Abstract, to emphasize that we are talking about "apparent" antigenic changes. As far as viral fitness is concerned,
there is no inference involved inasmuch as the rate of displacement of pre-existing lineages is what, actually, defines fitness.
Thus, apart from the aforementioned small modifications, we
believe that we have been sticking to the facts to begin with.
Background, 4th paragraph, and Results, 3nd paragraph,
and Methods section Please specify the "antigenic positions of the HA1 domain". The paper by Ratner et al. is in
Russian, which is not a language that everyone is familiar
with. The method section further refers to a statistical
analysis and a structural analysis, without providing us
with a list of positions that are considered to represent
epitopes. It is tricky to take either of these papers as the
gold standard for where the epitopes are located. It would
thus be good to list the "antigenic positions" in HA1 here.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/34

Background, last paragraph, Results, 4th paragraph, and
Discussion section on "bias" While I fully agree that the
influenza sequence databases are heavily biased towards
"outlier" strains (with unusual antigenic properties as
compared to other viruses isolated during the same epidemic), it is incorrect to assume that the sequence collection analyzed here is not biased. First of all, the sequences
are primarily from short epidemics in New York State and
New Zealand. With a virus that circulates (and evolves)
globally, this bias has large implications for the type of
work described here. In addition to geography, there may
be several other biases (sampled patient populations,
inclusion criteria for the sequencing project, etc.) that
could affect the fitness discussions that follow. The
authors have not addressed this issue at all, and simply
assume that their dataset is good enough. I am not so sure.
Author response: This is, indeed, an important issue, and we
agree that we did not address it in sufficient detail in the original version. However, there are relatively straightforward
arguments to the effect that geographical or other bias is
extremely unlikely to account for the pattern of stasis-rapid
change that we consistently observe in influenza evolution.
These arguments are presented in the revision (Discussion, 6th
paragraph).
Results, 2nd paragraph:
It is not clear to me what the results described here add to
the information provided in the papers by Barr et al., and
Holmes et al. that described the reassortant viruses in
detail (refs [7] and [8]). Could thus be shortened.
Author response: Surely, these papers have described the
reassortant viruses. However, a critical facet is missing there,
namely, the demonstration that "...reassortant strain is completely replaced by the non-reassorted Fujian strain ("late
Fujian") from 2004 onwards" (quote from our revised paper,
Results, 2nd paragraph; so this clarification was added.
Results, 2nd paragraph from the end:

Author response: The problem here is that the positions of the
epitopes in the particular isolate for which they have been
reported were projected on the multiple alignment of the HA
sequences. Thus, the specific coordinates in that particular isolate would hardly help much. In the revision, we expanded the
explanation of the procedure under Methods (section on Analysis of Selection Pressures, 2nd paragraph). The relevance of
Ratner's paper here is unclear as it is not about antigenic positions per se but about evidence of positive selection in HA. We
felt that it was highly desirable to cite this paper as the first one
(to our knowledge) that presented such evidence. It is available
in English translation.

Only data from the US are included, when the authors
state that 2000–2001 and 2002–2003 were H1N1 seasons. While this may be true in the US, it certainly was not
true for many other parts of the world. Should the competition between fit and less fit variants of H3N2 viruses and
those of the H1N1 subtype not be considered at the global
scale? Surely, with influenza viruses moving from Northern hemisphere to Southern hemisphere and back with
the seasons, the viruses evolve and compete on a global
scale, not just in the US.
Author response: The pattern was the same for New York
State and New Zealand which is shown in the revised Figure 3.

Page 13 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:34

We do not have comparable depth of data for other parts of the
world, unfortunately.
On the analyses of H1N1 strains (results and discussion)
The authors indicate that there was no positive selection
in H1N1. Despite the apparent lack of positive selection,
there have been vaccine updates in H1N1 strains because
of antigenic drift between 1995 and 2005 (e.g. A/New
Caledonia/2000). The question than arises; Do we need
positive selection for antigenic drift to occur? If not, we
cannot rely on sequences to identify when vaccine
updates are necessary?

Author response: We never claimed that antigenic drift
strictly requires positive selection. What we do claim is that
there is no evidence of substantial positive selection in H1N1
during the analyzed time interval, and accordingly, the dominance of H1N1 in some seasons was caused by the lack of
highly fit H3N2 isolates rather than by emergence of novel and
highly fit H1N1 viruses. In order to present the data on H1N1
evolution in a more compelling manner, we included Figure
5which shows the extensive mixing of isolates from different
years in the phylogenetic tree of H1N1.
Discussion section
I have some doubts about the interpretation of periods of
"stasis" and of "rapid evolution". Could this distinction
not be primarily due to incomplete nature of the sequence
set, temporally and spatially? While there may be relative
stasis locally among the strains that were sequenced in certain seasons in NY or NZ, using a "perfect" dataset (every
single flu strain globally is sequenced) the authors would
probably find "rapid evolution" somewhere at any given
time? This then would raise the question of how predictable the "rapid evolution" would be, and how useful such
analyses would be in predicting the dominant strains of
the next season.

Author response: As indicated above, this is an important
issue but we believe it is, effectively, logically impossible to
explain our conclusions by the incompleteness of the data (Discussion, 6thparagraph).
On the final conclusion of the authors that the common
view of influenza virus evolution as a positive selectiondriven process is incomplete
I am not convinced that the view of long periods of stasis
punctuated by short periods of fitness described here is
not primarily due to the use of a biased dataset. If the
authors disagree with this opinion (which I guess they
would) it would be good to discuss the issue of bias,
rather than just waiving it.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/34

Author response: Yes, we do disagree, i.e., we do not see how
the present results can be explained by biases in the data and
we did include the relevant discussion (see the responses
above).
I found the parallel amino acid replacements in different
genetic lineages interesting.
The last point worth mentioning is that prediction of the
predominant strain of the next influenza season is not the
primary task of the influenza surveillance network that
serves the WHO vaccine strain selection process. The primary task is to identify the emergence of strains that are
antigenically distinct and (as the result) will dominate the
next season. This way, the number of vaccine strain
updates can remain limited, which is important because
of cost, the interest of vaccine manufacturers, and perhaps
vaccine efficacy. It is unnecessary to update the vaccine
based on genetic changes that do not affect the antigenic
properties of the virus.
Author response: We certainly never claimed that it is necessary to change (update) the vaccine on the basis of sequence
changes per se. The salient considerations are different: i) it
might be possible to predict the future dominant strains by
sequence comparison, ii) the HI test is not necessarily reflective
of all relevant antigenic changes, so sequence analysis might
help identify other such changes.
Reviewer's report 2
David Krakauer, The Santa Fe Institute

Review of "Punctuated interpandemic evolution of influenza A virus"
The recent availability of broadly sampled influenza
genomes spanning the years 1995–2005 provides an
opportunity for a systematic analysis of genetic trends correlated with the emergence of flu pandemics. In this
paper, the authors adopting a phylogenetic framework,
report a punctuated mode of virus evolution, in which
diversity accumulates during periods of stasis and outbreaks are facilitated by selection against common strains.
Epistasis among sites of the HA gene provide one explanation for the "neutral" delays attending new outbreaks,
where multiple compensatory changes are required for
fixation of a new adaptive variant. This paper nicely serves
to illustrate that a constant rate model for microbial evolution, in which virulence is treated in terms of the independent contribution of amino acids in an epitope,
coupled to a simple competitive exclusion principle based
on replicative advantage, is too simple. Rather, new
strains can be generated neutrally long before their advantages are felt in a new selective context, where this context
shifts according the efficacy of host immunity to domi-

nant epitopes and the rates of recombination events promoting antigentic shift. I find the research very interesting,
but I do find, however, the final discussion of vaccine
development a little gratuitous given the findings of the
paper and perhaps an unnecessary appeal to the utility of
basic research.
Author response: We appreciate these insightful comments.
However, the discussion of the implications of the findings on
influenza evolution for vaccine development, in our view, has
nothing to do with "an ...appeal to the utility of basic research".
On the contrary, in the specific case of influenza, vaccine development and the basic trends in virus evolution are inextricably
(and traditionally) linked, and not considering the implications
of our findings would be strange. This being said, the corresponding part of the discussion was modified to make it less
evaluative.
Detailed remarks
1. I distrust the use of the term fitness in the abstract (end
of the Results section) to explain dominance, as in this
sentence, it provides no new information and sounds
vaguely circular.

Author response: Hard to agree. We believe that the current
wording, indeed, describes the situation properly: due to the
drop of the relative fitness of the previously dominant H3N2
isolates, the H1N1 isolates become dominant.
2. The final sentence of the results section of the abstract
could be stated more clearly. How about "The increase in
dominance of H1N1 in some seasons is most likely facilitated by an increased resistance to the incumbent H3N2
lineage during a period of stasis."
Author response: Again, we find the original wording to be
more precise, even if slightly more complicated. The issue is,
indeed, about the increase in the fraction of resistant hosts, not
just "resistance" in general terms. The preceding sentence,
though, has been reworded for clarity.
3. The final sentence of the conclusion of the abstract is
rather odd. How could parallel replacements serve as predictors of new dominant strains?

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/34

Author response: Point well taken, "striking" removed.
5. Figure 2 is rather impenetrable and could use a better
explanation
Author response: We added a new Figure 2(such that the
original Figure 2became Figure 3) that, hopefully, provides
such a explanation, at least with regard to the procedure used
to determine lineage extinction times.
6. I wonder whether it is not appropriate to simulate
(through bootstrapping for example) a null expectation
for the pattern of recurrent amino acid substitutions in the
data. It is hard to intuit how unlikely these events are.
Author response: We felt that this was beyond the scope of
the present work (it might become a subject of a future study).
Indeed, the main point here is the non-random distribution of
the parallel mutations across the lineages, and to establish this,
simulation does not seem to be required.
7. I am not yet convinced that what is being described is
competition among strains (last paragraph of the
Results). Competition implies a finite supply allocated
over a potentially more abundant demand population,
thereby promoting competitive exclusion. Here it is not
clear that the immune suppression of one strain is what
allows another to invade, or rather a simple suppression
of one and an indifference to another. This would be more
like sorting than selection in Wimsatts' usage with shifting
indifference allowing outbreaks. Perhaps a little more
detail on mechanism would help to make this distinction
clear?
Author response: There are some semantic issues involved
here that we are not entirely confident about. Regardless, there
does seem to be a competition (over a finite supply of susceptible
individuals) between H1N1 and H3N2, the outcome of which
depends on the fraction of the population that is naïve to each
of the respective viruses at a given time and evolution of the
viruses themselves that may allow them to escape immunity.

Author response: Why not? The isolates that undergo parallel changes are likely to be doing so due to positive selection and
might become dominant. This is explained in the Discussion.
We do recognize, however, that this is speculative and the language in the Abstract has been softened accordingly.

8. In the Discussion, an increase in fitness is associated
with rapid exploration of the adaptive landscape. But this
is not really correct. Selection increases the rate of hill
climbing to a local peak, but suppresses variance over the
landscape as a whole. As the authors argue earlier in the
paper, it is neutral evolution in the functionally "static"
period that promotes effective search, then new variants
are fixed through a rapid bout of selection.

4. I do worry a little about the lack of statistical significance for some of the results, given that they are described
as striking.

Author response: Yes, we must agree with this point. The
phrase in question was modified to indicate that, under selection, only specific areas on the landscape are quickly explored.

9. I think that the papers of Stadler and Fontana (e.g. current biology evodevo with RNA) on the role of neutrality
in promoting innovation more suitable than Gould and
Wagner.
Author response: We now cite Huynen, Stadler and Fontana, in addition to Gould and Wagner, along with a relevant
paper by one of us (Lipman and Wilbur 1991, ref. [23]).
10. A final remark on ds/dn ratios which offers an independent sites model of selection. Given the finding that
epistasis is likely to be very important, I worry about the
power of the ratio to reveal systematics trends. For example, there could be consistently strong directional selection, but little evidence of it, as a result of the
compensatory changes required by epistasis. I guess when
dn >> ds this might be sufficient to conclude directional
selection, but when ds > dn we can not really know. This
is hardly a unique failing of the current paper, but a common problem faced by the community of researchers
intent on quantifying selection.
Author response: The ambition of this paper is less general
than "quantifying selection". What we seek to demonstrate
and what does seem to become apparent is the existence of
major differences in the strength of selection between different
time intervals during influenza virus evolution.
Reviewer's report 3: Christopher Lee, University of
California-Los Angeles
This is a very interesting paper that sheds new light on a
scientifically and medically important question. It will
certainly be of interest to a broad audience of readers of
Biology Direct. The data and analysis methods appear
sound, although I have some questions about the graphical presentation and interpretation of the results. I also
suggest that additional text and a figure explaining some
of the paper's definitions and methods would be useful.

1. It would be helpful to have more explanation of exactly
what criteria were used for choosing the set of sequences
for identifying mutations and measuring dn/ds ratios. The
methods section indicates that only 100 H3N2 HA
sequences (of the 994 available) were used to obtain dn/
ds estimates. But the manuscript doesn't explain how the
100 sequences were chosen, why so few were used, and
how robust the dn/ds results would be if other samples of
HA sequences were used. If the results have some dependence on the sample chosen, it would be useful to give
some measure of their robustness (e.g. bootstrap).
Author response: We amended the text in question to indicate that the selected subsets represented all distinct side
branches (i.e., all except some that were adjacent in the tree
and were merged). It should be noted that the pattern of muta-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/34

tions mapped to the trunk branches and, accordingly, the dn/ds
estimates for the trunk is highly robust to the specific choice of
isolates from the side branches inasmuch as all of these
branches are represented. Of course, the dn/ds estimate for the
side branches themselves depends on the choice of isolates more
strongly but this is not crucial for our conclusions. As for bootstrap or a similar test, this is, unfortunately, computationally
prohibitive.
2. Given that the authors are having trouble showing statistical significance for the dn/ds results, I'd assume the
authors are using all the counts they can get; thus, some
further explanation of limiting the analysis to "100 HA
sequences" would be helpful. Similarly, do the mutations
counted in Fig. 2 (and shown in Fig. 3) comprise ALL
mutations in all 994 H3N2 HA sequences, or just a subset? Is this (sub)set of sequences different from that used
for the dn/ds calculations, and if so why? Alternatively, if
this (sub)set does not include all mutations observed in
the 994 sequences, what is the rationale for this different
choice of sequences? Reading the text I thought the dn/ds
counts in Fig. 2 should be measured solely on trunk
branches ("...positive selection in the epitope regions of
each new dominant lineage..."), but the text doesn't
explicitly say so. If the dn/ds numbers in Fig. 2 are not specific to the trunk branches, it would be helpful if the
authors could address how these results really relate to the
"dominant lineage" they refer to.
Author response: See above. The maximum likelihood calculations of dn/ds were performed for a subset of 100 sequences
for all branches and also for trunk and non-trunk branches separately as explained in the 3rd paragraph of the Results section
and shown in Table 1. As indicated in the response to (1), this
gives a complete picture of the mutations in the trunk. The rest
of the analysis dealt with all 994 sequences; in particular, the
data in Figure 3(former Figure 2) includes all trunk mutations
as is made explicit in the revised legend.
3. Since the dn/ds differences report in paragraph 3 of the
results ("To determine whether positive selection...") were
not statistically significant, it might make sense to move
this paragraph after the following paragraph (describing
Fig. 2 and epitope vs. non-epitope Fisher tests), whose dn/
ds differences were statistically significant. The current
paragraph 3 could then be positioned as an extension of
the statistically significant result, suggesting that there is
indeed dn/ds>1 positive selection.
Author response: We understand the potential advantages of
this order of presentation but we feel that the current order is
more logically cogent: the results of the standard test are given
first; these are suggestive but not compelling, so additional, less
common tests are described, and these do show that differences
in dn/ds values are statistically significant.

4. Distinguishing "trunk" vs. "non-trunk" branches is fundamental to much of the paper's analysis, but is not
explained prominently (the definition is hidden in the
Methods). Since the authors' criterion is quite simple, I
think it should be explained prominently in the paper, at
the first point these terms are used. I also think the definition of "dominant lineage" needs to be made explicit; e.g.
does this always mean the trunk branch? Similarly, it
would be helpful to clarify the distinction between "trunk
branches" (column title in Table 1) vs. "inter-clade
branches" (column title in Table 2).
Author response: The definition of the trunk is included in
the revised background section (4thparagraph). As for the
"inter-clade" branches, this is used for H1N1 because there was
no real trunk in that tree; this is made explicit in the revised
footnote to Table 2.
5. The precise definition of how H3N2 isolates are divided
into "lineages" is a bit hard to follow, and would be
greatly clarified by an explanatory figure. The Methods
section "Extinction of Lineages..." bristles with graphical
language ("below", "above", "proximal", "distal" etc.),
but all these complicated descriptions are not easy to picture. The authors seem to be going to considerable trouble
to describe a picture to the reader; I think it would be
much easier to just show the picture as a figure, with all the
relevant terms defined and labeled on the figure. As far as
I can tell, extinction times are computed for each trunk
branch node, based on the isolation times of its non-trunk
descendants, but a figure could make the definition both
clear and precise. For example, does the "90% extinction"
criterion mean sorting the non-trunk descendant isolates
by date, and finding the 90th percentile rank value of the
isolate dates? The "trunk" vs. "non-trunk" definition (see
above) could also be included in this figure. Since Biology
Direct has no limit on pages or figures, this seems like an
easy solution. I'm hoping this would also clarify Fig. 2 (see
next point).
Author response: The procedure employed to estimate extinction times is now illustrated in the new Figure 2; we believe that
this does, indeed, facilitate understanding of Figure 3(former
Figure 2).
6. In Fig. 2, why are extinction times shown for some
trunk branch nodes, but not others? E.g. between the
upper "41" and the "4" right above it, there are many
trunk branch nodes, but extinction times are not shown
for them. What is the criterion that determines which
trunk branch nodes have extinction times computed for
them?
Author response: The extinction times are given for all segments of the trunk bounded by precisely dated isolates. Without

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/34

such dating, extinction time could not be estimated. This is
noted in the last section of the Methods.
7. In Fig. 2, it would be helpful to label the left column
"Extinction time (mo.)" and the right column "Mutations
(n/s)".
Author response: done as suggested.
8. In Fig. 3, the use of color is potentially confusing (i.e.
red/green means very different things for the lines vs. letters). I suggest that all mutations simply be printed in
black, with BOLD for epitope mutations, and ITALICS for
non-epitope mutations.
Author response: modified as suggested.
9. Comparing the amino acid mutation counts in Fig. 2 vs.
the mutations shown in Fig. 3, the numbers don't match,
so it would be useful for the authors to clarify precisely the
criteria for what mutations are included in the counts for
Fig. 2 vs. Fig. 3. I had assumed that the Fig. 2 counts would
only reflect trunk branches (to measure positive selection
on the "dominant", trunk branch); am I wrong?
Author response: These figures (3 and 4 in the revision) present
different data. Only those mutations in the trunk for which
there are parallel mutations in side branches are shown in Figure 4. Thus, there is no reason to expect the same numbers.
10. It might be possible to improve the presentation of the
data in Fig. 2. Specifically, we're asked to correlate two
important types of data in this figure (extinction times
and dn/ds numbers); both are quantitative, but are only
presented as text, and are disconnected from each other by
two layers of "mapping". I suggest that this be reformatted
to show two separate results: the raw data for the extinction time result, and the correlation of extinction times vs.
dn/ds mutation events.
The first reason for suggesting this is that the extinction
time result is in fact an important result in itself, and I
think readers of the current manuscript will have trouble
understanding exactly how the authors got this result. I
suggest the following graphic. Use the y-axis to represent
the origination date of trunk branch nodes (i.e. inferred
origination date of each lineage, with a point shown for
each lineage), essentially drawn just like the time-axis currently shown on the right hand side of Fig. 2. Use the xaxis to show extinction times: draw a horizontal bar showing the extinction time for each lineage; optionally, you
could also draw tick marks showing the raw isolate dates
(relative to the lineage origination date). Hopefully this
would allow readers to evaluate for themselves the raw
data for the existence of two distinct phases of "stasis" vs.

Page 17 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:34

"rapid turnover". It would also be helpful to calculate
some kind of p-value for this hypothesis, and to show a
histogram of lineage extinction times so people can see
"two peaks" (or at least, not one peak).
There are several options for showing the correlation vs.
mutation counts. The mutation counts could simply be
juxtaposed as text (as in the current Fig. 2). Additionally,
dates of individual mutation events (epitope, nonepitope, and synonymous, each with a distinct symbol)
could be marked on the right hand side based on their
inferred date, so that readers can see the raw data. Doing
this as a separate figure (i.e. not within Fig. 2) would be
OK, if that helps reader comprehension by letting the
reader focus on one result at a time.
Author response: We tried several alternatives to Figure 3
(former Figure 2) but, in the end, decided to stick to the original format. Hopefully, the new Figure 2does clarify at least
some of it (also see the response to the next point).
11. Is it possible to include in the Fig. 2 the dominance
period of each subtype? This would make it easy to see
whether the H3N2 stasis is associated with H1N1 dominance or not.

Author response: As per this suggestion, the H1N1 dominance intervals are now shown.
12. For a general audience, it would be helpful to add
some explanation of what "Immune cross-protection"
means, e.g. "low frequency of co-infection by both H1N1
and H3N2"

6.

8.

Author response: In this context, immune cross-protection
simply means that individuals that develop immune response to
H1N1 are less likely to get sick when infected with H3N2 and
vice versa. Co-infection is not involved.

I hope some of these questions are helpful.
