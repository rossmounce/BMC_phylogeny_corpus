Abstract
Background: Previous phylogenetic analyses of African elephants have included limited numbers
of forest elephant samples. A large-scale assessment of mitochondrial DNA diversity in forest
elephant populations here reveals a more complex evolutionary history in African elephants as a
whole than two-taxon models assume.
Results: We analysed hypervariable region 1 of the mitochondrial control region for 71 new
central African forest elephants and the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene from 28 new samples
and compare these sequences to other African elephant data. We find that central African forest
elephant populations fall into at least two lineages and that west African elephants (both forest and
savannah) share their mitochondrial history almost exclusively with central African forest
elephants. We also find that central African forest populations show lower genetic diversity than
those in savannahs, and infer a recent population expansion.
Conclusion: Our data do not support the separation of African elephants into two evolutionary
lineages. The demographic history of African elephants seems more complex, with a combination
of multiple refugial mitochondrial lineages and recurrent hybridization among them rendering a
simple forest/savannah elephant split inapplicable to modern African elephant populations.

Background
The taxonomic status of the African elephant (Loxodonta
africana) has been debated since the turn of the 20th century [1] and up to 22 subspecies have been described [2].
However, modern taxonomy refers to two types, with
their names reflecting the habitat in which they are found,

namely the larger savannah (Loxodonta africana africana)
(Blumenbach 1797) and the smaller forest (Loxodonta africana cyclotis) (Matschie 1900) elephants. It has become
increasingly established in the literature that forest and
savannah elephants are distinct species (L. Africana and L.
cyclotis) [3-7], with recent publications considering their

datasets in the light of this concept. The most persuasive
genetic basis for a two-taxon model originates from a
series of studies exploring patterns of differentiation at
nuclear loci, culminating in a study using male inherited
Y-chr, andbi-parentally inherited X-chr sequences [6] that
concluded "there was a deep and almost complete separation
between African forest and African savannah elephants." In
this study, divergent nuclear DNA sequences segregated
with either forest or savannah elephant morphological
types. There were, however, a number of exceptions,
including a forest elephant from Garamba in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC, where forest and savannah populations are sympatric) that had nuclear
sequences typical of savannah elephants and two savannah elephants from Cameroon (at the limit of the forestsavannah transition zone) that had nuclear sequences typical of forest elephants [6]. The study estimated the divergence between the savannah and forest elephants to be 3
million years. The two-taxon argument has also been used
to explain data from two nuclear microsatellite DNA [5,7]
and one morphological study [8,9]. However, subsequently Debruyne [10] performed a morphometric analysis of museum elephant skulls, and found evidence for a
continuum between two morphotypes, suggesting that,
despite historical separation that promoted subdivision,
these two forms freely interbreed wherever their ranges
intersect.
Molecular studies using mitochondrial (mt) DNA [10,11]
including data from the study by Roca et al [6] have
pointed to a more complex scenario for African elephants.
Debruyne [10] examined several thousand base pairs of
mtDNA from elephants across Africa and although he also
reported two highly divergent molecular clades, these did
not conform to the morphological delineations of cyclotis
and africana. He interpreted these results as a consequence
of incomplete isolation between forest and savannah African elephant populations, followed by recurrent and
ongoing introgression between the two forms. Roca et al.
[6] obtained very similar mitochondrial results but
explained the non-concordance between mitochondrial
and nuclear markers as a result of cytonuclear genomic
disassociation such that the mitochondrial tree did not
reflect the species tree. The mtDNA results observed were
explained as having arisen during episodes of backcrossing between successive generations of savannah males
with forest females, leading to half of extant savannah elephants surveyed possessing 'forest' typical mitochondrial
haplotypes but almost exclusively 'savannah' nuclear X
and Y-chromosomal DNA. Eggert et al. [11] (in addition
to Nyakaana et al.'s mitochondrial sequences [12])
included samples from west Africa and found a more
complex picture using mtDNA and nuclear microsatellites, suggesting that western savannah and forest elephants formed a potential third Loxodonta taxonomic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/244

unit. Finally, Roca et al.[13]recently revisited the question
with a statistical re-analysis of eight morphological and
genetic datasets (nuclear and mitochondrial) including
their own and those of Eggert et al.[11] and Debruyne [10]
and reconfirmed their initial interpretation of a two taxon
model with cyto-nuclear genomic dissociation.
The above-mentioned studies largely share a pronounced
lack of forest elephant data. The nuclear DNA studies
[4,11] featured limited sampling from central African forest elephants. Despite describing a narrow hybrid zone
between the two elephant types, only one population
located in this zone (Garamba, (DRC)) was included and
none from elsewhere in DRC or from west central Africa
were examined. Elsewhere, Debruyne [10] included elephants from across DRC in his study but was again limited
by sample size. The study by Eggert et al. [11] was limited
by the inclusion of only two populations of Central African forest elephants, both from the edge of the forest
range in Cameroon which may conceivably have influenced their conclusion of the genetic uniqueness of forest
and western elephants. To date, no study has addressed
the partitioning of genetic diversity in the equatorial forests of Africa. Further, the potential effect of Pleistocene
forest refugia was partially addressed by Eggert et al.[11]
and also previously reported as having a major influence
on large mammal distribution and range dynamics [1418] has yet to be addressed in African elephants. Here we
report results from the most extensive sample of forest elephants to date, from the core of their range, and compare
these results with previously published mitchondrial
DNA sequences for savannah elephants from east and
southern Africa and populations from west Africa and
DRC.
We examined the phylogeographic history, population
structure and past demography of African elephants using
patterns of molecular diversity for the mtDNA control
region and cytochrome b gene. Since mtDNA is maternally inherited, this marker provides a female-biased view
of population history and structure. We included the most
variable mtDNA segment, the hypervariable region 1
(HVR1) of the control region since it has a high rate of
nucleotide change, allowing recently diverged lineages to
be distinguished [19-21]. This segment is equivalent to
data previously published by Eggert et al. [11] and Debruyne [10], allowing us to examine forest elephant
sequences within the context of a sample set with the largest geographic coverage. We could not use Roca's mtDNA
sequences as he studied a different fragment (ND5 instead
of control region).

Results
Central forest samples
We sequenced 316 bp of HVR1 of the control region from
71 samples and 396 bp of the cytochrome b from 28. No
nuclear copies of mitochondrial DNA (Numts) were
detected for either sequence.
Combined sequences
Genetic diversity
For HVR1, we analysed 189 sequences from 66 sites across
Africa in both forest and savannah elephants (Figure 1).
Of these 102 were from forest elephants (71 samples from
the present study and 31 from Genbank) and 87 savannah
elephants (all from Genbank). The combined dataset
comprised eighty-eight haplotypes (33 and 51 from forest
and savannah elephants, respectively) and four haplotypes found in both types. Of the 21 central African forest
elephant haplotypes identified in this study, 17 were
novel (Genbank accessions EU096114 – EU096130).
Mean nucleotide diversity (π) for HVR1 sequences for all
African elephants was 0.030 (SD = 0.015), while mean
haplotype diversity (h) was 0.985 (SD = 0.003). When
haplotypes were divided into forest and savannah, based
on prior designation, the forest population π was 0.022
(SD = 0.11), significantly lower than for savannah elephants (0.034, SD = 0.017; p < 0.001). The mean haplotype diversity for forest and savannah populations was
0.960 (SD = 0.007) and 0.986 (SD = 0.004), respectively.
The lowest nucleotide diversity of all groupings was for
the new central African forest samples in this study
(0.013, SD = 0.007), while haplotype diversity was 0.947
(SD = 0.009).

For cytochrome b, 100 sequences were analysed, 28 from
this study, 27 provided by SN and 45 from Genbank.
Forty-four haplotypes were identified including three and
22 new forest and savannah elephant sequences, respectively (Genbank accessions EU115995 – EU116019). Of
the 44 haplotypes, 32 were found in savannah elephants
and 10 in forest elephants, with two haplotypes found in
both. Mean π for cytochrome b was 0.023 (0.012) for all
elephants. When forest and savannah elephants were subdivided, π was again significantly lower for forest populations (0.009, SD = 0.005) than for savannah populations
(0.026, SD = 0.013; p < 0.001). These results contrast with
the study of Roca et al. (2005) who reported 15 haplotypes for 281 elephants at the mitochondrial ND5 locus
and described low genetic diversity as being typical for
savannah elephants.
Population structure
The median joining networks for the HVR1 and cytochrome b sequences (Figures 2 and 3, respectively),
exhibit patterns consistent with a complex demographic
history. The HVR1 pattern is more complex (comprising

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/244

four haplogroups – here labelled HVR1 Haplogroup I, II,
III and IV) than for cytochrome b (three haplogroups labelled Cytb Haplogroup I, II and III). Haplotype designations for this and previous studies for both sequences
are found in Table 1 (HVR) and Table 2 (cyt b). For the
HVR1 region, the most obvious feature is that central African forest elephants (excluding those from DRC) fall into
two separate groups (HVR1 Haplogroups I and II) with little geographic structuring, consisting of 19 (HVR1 Haplogroup I) and 20 (HVR1 Haplogroup II) haplotypes with
variable frequencies. Only two forest elephants from
DRC, share the same haplotype with other forest elephants in HVR1 Haplogroup II. The remaining seven DRC
forest elephant haplotypes (all south-east of the Congo
River), group with sequences in HVR1 Haplogroup III
(which additionally comprises savannah elephants from
eastern and southern Africa and one savannah elephant
from Cameroon). The other striking feature is that for
West African elephants (from Eggert et al 2002, see Table
1 for haplotype designations), both forest and savannah
types possess haplotypes found almost exclusively within
the same haplogroup as central African forest elephants
(HVR1 Haplogroups I and II). Twenty-five out of 26 haplotypes from west Africa are more closely related to central
Forest elephants from Gabon, Congo and CAR. A single
western savannah sequence (H15) can be found in HVR1
Haplogroup IV grouping with savannah elephants from
eastern, southern and central Africa. Analysis of Molecular
Variance (AMOVA) of HVR1 sequences revealed a nonsignificant (p = 0.065) genetic structure (18.62% variation
among populations) when populations were grouped
according to geographic distribution (west, central, east
and southern Africa).
As expected, Cytochrome b is less variable than HVR1.
However, direct comparison between patterns obtained
from both regions is compromised here due to a lack of
equivalent individuals examined at both loci, specifically
for savannah elephants. However the overall pattern
when individuals from different populations were examined is consistent with the pattern obtained with HVR1,
despite the resolution of only three haplogroups as
opposed to four. Savannah elephant haplotypes fall into
two distinct haplogroups (Cyt b Haplogroup II and III) as
do forest elephant haplotypes (Cyt b Haplogroups I and
II). Cytochrome b Haplogroup II, which is divided into
two haplogroups for HVR1, is characterised by a network
structure in which forest and savannah elephant samples
are not overlaid (see Figure 3). Again all western elephants, both forest and savannah, cluster with central
African forest elephants (Cyt b Haplogroup I).
Demographic history
When HVR1 sequences from forest and savannah elephants were examined separately, Fu's Fs was -14.2954

(P = 0.0021) and -24.4427 (P < 0.0001), respectively.
Although significant values can indicate historical population expansion, the multimodal pattern (Figure 4) for the
forest elephant groups suggests that these populations
encompass several subgroups as indicated in the networks. When we examined each haplogroup separately

for signatures of demographic change (Table 3), a smooth
and predominantly unimodal pattern was observed for
HVR1 Haplogroup I, indicating a recent demographic
expansion (Figure 5), while HVR1 Haplogroups II, III and
IV were more complex, including the presence of some
divergent haplotypes.

Discussion
In the light of the results obtained with the mitochondrial
sequences used here, additional interpretations of the history of African elephants become evident and suggest that
the conclusions drawn in previous studies may have been
hampered by incomplete sample sets. Forest elephants
have been affected by cyclical climatic changes that
occurred over the last 2.6 million years as the colder drier
periods experienced during Pleistocene glacial maxima
are believed to have led to the repeated retraction of forest
cover into refugial zones followed by re-expansion, fostering allopatric divergence between isolated populations
[22] and secondary contact. The forest elephant range is
therefore likely to have become centred around such refugia on several occasions. The dataset presented here raises
the possibility of at least two different refugia in the central African region harbouring distinct elephant populations that diverged allopatrically. If this was the case,
forest elephants possessing distinct mitochondrial genotypes are likely to have come into contact relatively rapidly after the end of the last glaciation (12,000 years BP),
when the forests re-expanded [23]. Such a scenario might
explain not only the two haplogroups present in forest
elephants but also the lower nucleotide diversity that
characterises elephant populations found in forest habitat.
This scenario might also explain the high microsatellite
diversity reported for forest elephants [5]. If several populations diverged in isolation, accumulating different microsatellite profiles, and subsequently became sympatric as
the forest expanded, the large single population that today
comprises two central African forest elephant lineages
might be expected to have engendered higher microsatellite diversity. Savannah populations, especially those in
the south and east, would not have been affected by forest
expansion since these areas remained unforested and thus
habitat would not have been lost. Those savannah populations that may have been affected are those that may
have occurred in areas that subsequently became forested.
One explanation for the close genetic proximity between
forest and savannah genotypes in DRC could be introgres-

sion between savannah haplotypes into forest genomes as
forests expanded and savannah habitat was lost. Such
introgression would be in the opposite direction to that
proposed by Roca et al. [4,6].
The results obtained for elephants in west and central
Africa have strong implications for the division of elephants into forest and savannah species. These elephants
are taxonomically indeterminate [24] and have been
described as having an intermediate morphology [8].
Mitochondrially, West African elephants are found in the
same haplogroups as the (two) forest elephant lineages of
central Africa. If ancient female-mediated introgression
between the two forms followed by backcrossing into
savannah populations is the reason why western savannah elephants possess largely 'forest' haplotypes then
nuclear markers at these loci should resemble predominantly those of southern and eastern savannah elephants
today. Alternatively these elephant populations could be
an example of protracted gene flow between two forms of
elephant, which is ongoing (or was until recently) and
that west African savannah elephants are not distinguishable at the genetic or morphological level from their forest
counterparts (thus undermining the two-taxon model). A
third explanation could be a 'second movement' of elephants out of the forest (from either west or central Africa)
and into the savannah. There are insufficient data to determine whether there was a single movement from forest to
savannah habitat or whether these were multiple events,
precipitating the morphological changes observed today.
Whatever the origin of the two types, our data would support continued extensive hybridisation between the two
proposed forms.

Conclusion
Our mitochondrial analysis does not support the simple
separation of modern African elephants into two groups.
The evidence is most clear in west Africa where savannah
elephants are indistinguishable at both the mitochondrial
and morphological level from their forest counterparts.
The two species model cannot be easily applied in this
region and neither do west African elephants represent a

third distinct entity. Central African elephant populations
west of the Congo river also question the current classification. Forest elephants fall into two major groupings
with mitochondrial DNA. Previous studies found two
major groups for all African elephants, savannah and
savannah/forest perhaps suggesting ancient introgression
between forest females and savannah males in the past.
However the inclusion of a larger central forest sample in
this study would suggest that this explanation is too simple and that African elephants were subject to a more
complex demographic history. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic reanalysis of species is important for many reasons but with the massive extinction of species in the wild
in the last 50 years accurate descriptions are essential for
management of wild resources. For elephants, the classification of species into savannah and forest may not reflect
their evolutionary history but simply the habitat in which
they currently exist. While ecotypic differentiation has
been shown to be the predominant factor driving molecular divergence in one widely distributed African herbivore recently [25], this may not apply in elephants and if it
does, may not conform to a simple forest versus savannah
habitat driven divergence. To develop management strategies incorporating a simple forest/savannah model could
be misleading until further lines of evidence give us a
clearer picture of the origins and current conservation
needs of elephants populations throughout the continent.
Future studies should analyse nuclear DNA markers,
including those which evolve rapidly, across the range of
forest and savannah elephants and especially in transition
zones to investigate this complex ongoing process further.

Methods
Sampling and laboratory procedures
Elephant sequences from 66 sites across Africa were incorporated (Figure 1). New forest elephant samples (HVR1
mtDNA: n = 71; Cyt b mtDNA: n = 28) were obtained
using feces from 12 sites in the central African forest block
(red dots, Figure 1).

Samples were stored in RNAlater (Ambion RNA later® and
Qiagen RNA later ™) or silica gel, and DNA was extracted
from these using the Qiagen DNA stool mini kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) kit following the manufacturer's protocol.
An approximately 630 bp fragment of mitochondrial
DNA was amplified, encompassing the 3' end of the cyto-

chrome b gene, transfer RNAs (Threonine, Proline) and
358 bp of the control region. The control region section
was amplified in 71 samples using primers MDL3 and
MDL5 [26]. Primers AFDL1 and AFDL2 (situated 400 bp
from the 3'end of the cytochrome b gene through to the 5'
end of the control region), and AFDL3 and AFDL4 (situated 377 bp from the 3' end of tRNA proline to the 5'end
of the control region) were employed to gain overlapping
sequence for some degraded samples [11]. A 494 bp fragment of cytochrome b was analysed separately with 28
sequences using the primers L15024 and H15516 [3].
Amplifications were performed in 50 μl containing 50
mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1.5 mM Mg2+, 200 μmol of
each dNTP, 0.2 μmol of each primer, 1.5 U Taq DNA
polymerase (Qiagen) and approx. 10 ng of genomic DNA.
Thirty to 40 cycles were carried out using a Perkin-Elmer
Cetus 9600 or 9700 DNA thermocycler with denaturation
at 94°C for 45s, annealing at 63°C for 45s, and extension
at 72°C for 45s. PCR products were purified using the
Qiagen PCR purification kit and subsequently sequenced
commercially (Macrogen, Korea).
Analysis of genetic diversity and differentiation
Forward and reverse sequences for each individual and
the consensus sequences for all individuals were aligned
using SEQUENCHER (Gene Codes Corporation 1998,
version 3.1.1) and rechecked by eye. Genetic diversity for
all geographic locations was estimated using haplotype h
and nucleotide π diversities as implemented in Arlequin
ver. 3.0 [27]. Paired t-tests were carried out to assess
whether there was significant difference in nucleotide
diversity between forest and savannah elephants. Genetic
differentiation between pairs of populations was tested
using the exact test using 10,000 Markov chain steps, as
implemented in ARLEQUIN ver. 3.0, and this program
was also employed for nested analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) to test for patterns of spatial genetic structure. The dataset was divided in forest and savannah
groupings and then four regional populations were
defined (west, central, east and south). Using AMOVA the
correlation among genotype distances is used as an F-statistic analog (Phi) at various hierarchical levels.

Weighted maximum likelihood distances [28] were used
to derive a median joining network (MJN) with the program NETWORK V4.1.1.1. Haplotype networks may more
effectively portray the relationships among sequences for
populations than maximum likelihood or maximum par-

simony which are the traditional methods developed to
define interspecific relationships, leading to poor resolution at the population level [29].
Analysis of population demography
Tests were performed to detect evidence of past demographic change. We used ARLEQUIN ver.3.0 to perform a
pairwise mismatch distribution, comparing the distribution of the observed pairwise nucleotide site differences
with the expected distribution in an expanding population [30]. In a single origin, demographically expanding
population, mismatches should follow a unimodal Poisson distribution whereas in populations at demographic
equilibrium or with sub-groups, the distribution is usually multimodal. We tested the goodness-of-fit of the
observed data to a simulated model of expansion with the
sum of square deviations (SSD) and the Harpending's raggedness index r, using ARLEQUIN.

Population history was also inferred using Fu's FS test of

this test because it is the most powerful coalescent-based
neutrality test for detecting population growth for larger
sample sizes.
