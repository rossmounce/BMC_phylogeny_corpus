Abstract
Background: Wood is a major renewable natural resource for the timber, fibre and bioenergy
industry. Pinus radiata D. Don is the most important commercial plantation tree species in Australia
and several other countries; however, genomic resources for this species are very limited in public
databases. Our primary objective was to sequence a large number of expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) from genes involved in wood formation in radiata pine.
Results: Six developing xylem cDNA libraries were constructed from earlywood and latewood
tissues sampled at juvenile (7 yrs), transition (11 yrs) and mature (30 yrs) ages, respectively. These
xylem tissues represent six typical development stages in a rotation period of radiata pine. A total
of 6,389 high quality ESTs were collected from 5,952 cDNA clones. Assembly of 5,952 ESTs from
5' end sequences generated 3,304 unigenes including 952 contigs and 2,352 singletons. About 97.0%
of the 5,952 ESTs and 96.1% of the unigenes have matches in the UniProt and TIGR databases. Of
the 3,174 unigenes with matches, 42.9% were not assigned GO (Gene Ontology) terms and their
functions are unknown or unclassified. More than half (52.1%) of the 5,952 ESTs have matches in
the Pfam database and represent 772 known protein families. About 18.0% of the 5,952 ESTs
matched cell wall related genes in the MAIZEWALL database, representing all 18 categories, 91 of
all 174 families and possibly 557 genes. Fifteen cell wall-related genes are ranked in the 30 most
abundant genes, including CesA, tubulin, AGP, SAMS, actin, laccase, CCoAMT, MetE, phytocyanin, pectate
lyase, cellulase, SuSy, expansin, chitinase and UDP-glucose dehydrogenase. Based on the PlantTFDB
database 41 of the 64 transcription factor families in the poplar genome were identified as being
involved in radiata pine wood formation. Comparative analysis of GO term abundance revealed a
distinct transcriptome in juvenile earlywood formation compared to other stages of wood
development.
Conclusion: The first large scale genomic resource in radiata pine was generated from six
developing xylem cDNA libraries. Cell wall-related genes and transcription factors were identified.
Juvenile earlywood has a distinct transcriptome, which is likely to contribute to the undesirable
properties of juvenile wood in radiata pine. The publicly available resource of radiata pine will also
be valuable for gene function studies and comparative genomics in forest trees.

Background
Radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) is the dominant forest
plantation species for the sawmill industry in Australia,
New Zealand, Chile and some other countries. Breeding
programs in radiata pine have been conducted in Australia since the early 1950s. The first generation of breeding increased the growth rate by 33%, thus reduced the
rotation period to 27–30 yrs from the previous 40–45 yrs
[1]. Consequently, the faster growth rate resulted in a large
proportion (30–50%) of juvenile wood in the harvested
logs [2,3]. Juvenile wood has a number of undesirable
wood properties [1,3] and its higher proportion in the
harvested logs reduces the value of timber products.
Improving juvenile wood quality and reducing its proportion have been identified as the priorities in the next generation breeding program of radiata pine. Understanding
wood formation at the molecular level would underpin
more efficient breeding strategies for the improvement of
juvenile wood.

82 up- or down-regulated transcript-derived fragments
(TDFs) [21]. Development of juvenile and mature wood
in radiata pine is still poorly characterised at the genomics
level.
We applied genomics approaches to investigate the transcriptional regulation of xylogenesis in radiata pine, with
a focus on juvenile wood formation. Six developing xylem
cDNA libraries were constructed from earlywood and latewood tissues collected from juvenile (7 yrs), transition
(11 yrs) and mature (30 yrs) trees, respectively. The sampled xylem tissues represent the major stages of wood
development in a typical rotation period of radiata pine.
A total of 6,389 high quality xylogenesis ESTs were
sequenced from 5,952 cDNA clones and assembled into
3,304 unigenes. Here we report the generation and analysis of a genomic resource for wood formation in radiata
pine.

Results
Genomics approaches have been applied to explore the
molecular basis of growth and development in forest tree
species. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and microarray
gene expression studies have been carried out in poplar,
loblolly pine, spruce and eucalypts [4-15]. Due to the economic value of wood, all forest genomic projects were primarily focused on the transcriptional regulation of wood
formation (xylogenesis). Xylogenesis is initiated in the
vascular cambium and proceeded from cell division to
expansion, secondary wall formation, lignification, and
finally programmed cell death [5,12]. Large numbers of
xylogenesis ESTs from forest tree species have been deposited in public databases, including 59,797 ESTs from
loblolly pine, 25,218 ESTs from poplars, 16,430 ESTs
from white spruce and 52,330 ESTs from sitka spruce
(extracted from [6,8,14,16], respectively). Furthermore,
the genome of Populus trichocarpa (~550 Mbp) has been
published [17], and efforts to sequence the Eucalyptus
grandis genome (~640 Mbp) are in progress [18]. However, the large conifer genome (~20,000 Mbp) [19] is
unlikely to be sequenced in the near future, thus EST
sequencing remains an important approach for gene discovery in conifers.
Despite the commercial importance of radiata pine in
many countries, little genomic research has been done for
this species compared to loblolly pine, Populus, spruce,
maritime pine and eucalypts. As of January 20, 2009, only
151 radiata pine ESTs appear in the NCBI GeneBank
(dbEST), and no unigene information is available.
Recently, 455 genes were observed to be differentially
expressed in the base to the crown of the radiata pine trees
using modified differential display [20]. Gene expression
in the early embryogenesis of Pinus radiata was studied
using the cDNA-AFLPs strategy, which revealed a total of

EST sequencing and assembly
In total, 6,389 high quality ESTs of at least 100 bp in
length were collected from approximately 8,000 raw
sequences. The 6,389 ESTs were sequenced from 5,952
different cDNA clones in six developing xylem cDNA
libraries. Average size of all 6,389 ESTs and the 5,952 ESTs
from 5' end sequences is 624 bp and 636 bp, respectively.
Of the 5,952 ESTs, 86.4% and 69.6% are greater than 300
bp and 500 bp in length, respectively. The number of ESTs
in each library ranged from 694 in earlywood at transition
age to 1,636 in latewood at juvenile age (Table 1). Juvenile wood has the highest proportion of ESTs due to the
focus of this study. The assembly of all 5,952 ESTs from 5'
end sequences generated 3,304 xylogenesis unigenes,
including 952 contigs (28.8%) and 2,352 singletons
(71.2%) (Table 1).

The 3,304 unigenes have an average length of 702 bp;
41.0% are more than 800 bp, and only 13.5% are less
than 300 bp. Of the 952 contigs, 28.4% (270) have four
or more transcripts (Figure 1) and the three deepest contigs included 69–79 transcripts. Since the ESTs and unigenes were derived from a total of seven different
genotypes of radiata pine, these deep contigs provide an
opportunity to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs). The number of ESTs forming a contig reflects the
level of EST redundancy in the cDNA libraries. The assembly of 5,952 ESTs from 5' end sequences revealed 47.8%
of redundancy in the radiata pine EST collection (Table 1).
However, the EST redundancy in each library varies from
14.2% to 44.4%, with an average redundancy of 28.8%
(Table 1). The redundancy may increase significantly during further EST sequencing. By comparison, the EST
redundancy in the radiata pine EST collection is slightly
higher than the estimated redundancy of 28% in Populus

Functional annotation and classification
Blast searches of the 5,952 ESTs against the NCBI nr database revealed 73.4% and 69.0% matches with tblastx and
blastx (E-value ≤ 10-5), respectively. However, 71.3% of all
matches with blastx are either unknowns (47.5%),
unnamed (13.6%), hypothetical (5.4%) or predicted proteins (4.7%). When using the UniProt database with
blastx (E-value ≤ 10-5) and TIGR database with blastn (Evalue ≤ 10-15), 97.6% of the 5,952 ESTs have homologs
and only 20.5% of all matches are unknowns or uncharacterized proteins. Of the 139 ESTs (2.3%) with no
matches in the UniProt and TIGR databases, 41 ESTs are

greater than 500 bp in length and remain as singletons
after assembly, thus some of which are likely to represent
putative novel ESTs in radiata pine wood formation.
Based on the Pfam known protein family database, 52.1%
of the ESTs have homologs with blastx (E-value ≤ 10-5)
and were classified into 772 protein families. Nearly half
of the ESTs (47.9%) did not match the known protein
families in the Pfam database, thus they were regarded as
unknown protein families.
Of the 3,304 xylogenesis unigenes, 68.1% have matches
in the NCBI nr database with blastx, however 77.3% of all
matches are unknowns or uncharacterized proteins. In
contrast, a total of 96.1% of the unigenes matched
sequences in the UniProt (with blastx) and TIGR (with
blastn) databases and only 42.9% of all matches were not
assigned GO terms (Table 2). The results blasted with unigenes are similar to those with ESTs. In the functional classification with GO terms, 89.1% of the 1,813 unigenes
with assigned GO terms have molecular functions, 74.6%
are involved in a biological process, and 47.8% are cellular components. The three categories of GO terms fell predominantly into one or two sub-categories (Figure 2). In
the molecular function category with 1,616 unigenes
56.4% and 57.2% have binding and catalytic activity,
respectively. Of the 867 unigenes in the cellular component, 98.9% are related to cell components. As for the
1,353 unigenes involved in biological process, 87.7% and
96.2% have functions in cellular process and physiological process, respectively.
The functional annotation of 3,304 unigenes using the
UniProt database revealed 2,101 (63.6%) matches, which
is slightly lower than the matches using the NCBI nr database. Of the 2,101 matched unigenes 1,813 were assigned
with GO terms and matched 1,582 different UniProt
accession numbers, which suggests that possibly 1,582
non-redundant genes with known functions have been
identified in wood formation of radiata pine. Significant

*: Annotation was based on blastx with unigenes against UniProt; for the no hits a further blastn was performed against the TIGR database;
functional classification was based on GO terms.

GO term enrichments of the xylogenesis related genes in
radiata pine (Table 3) were revealed using the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 2008 [23,24]. The mostly enriched
GO terms in biological process (BP) include cellular protein metabolic process, transport, cellular component
organization and biogenesis, and catabolic process. In cellular component (CC), cytoplasmic part, macromolecular
complex, and non-membrane-bound organelle are the
mostly enriched terms. While in the molecular function
(MF), nucleotide binding, transporter activity, peptidase
activity, and structural molecular activity are highly
enriched. Further DAVID functional classification
revealed 13 functional groups with an enrichment score of
at least 1.26 (Additional file 1). The most significant functional group is a cluster of 11 genes showing a peptidase
function.
Cell wall biosynthesis genes
In the 5,952 ESTs, only 6.8% have homologs (blastx, Evalue ≤ 10-5) in the Cell Wall Navigator, a primary wall
gene database of Arabidopsis [25]. However, all 18 categories of primary and secondary wall genes in the MAIZEWALL database [26] were represented in the radiata pine
EST resource, including 1,070 ESTs classified into 91 cell
wall gene families (Additional file 2). Therefore, genes
related to secondary cell walls are highly accumulated in
the radiata pine EST resource. The 1,070 cell wall related
ESTs of radiata pine were previously assembled into 826
contigs and 19 singletons, which matched sequences in
the UniProt and TIGR databases with 557 non-redundant
accession numbers, suggesting possibly 557 cell wallrelated genes occurred in the radiata pine EST resource.
The most abundant cell wall gene is cellulose synthase
(CesA), with a total of 175 ESTs (2.9%). Other cell wall
related genes in the 30 most highly abundant genes
include tubulin, arabinogalactan protein genes (AGP), S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (SAMS), actin, laccase, CCoAMT,
methionine synthase (cobalamin-independent) (MetE),phytocyanin, pectate lyase,cellulase, sucrose synthase (SuSy),
expansin, chitinase and UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (Table
4).

Some cell wall genes were moderately abundant (10–20
ESTs) in the radiata pine EST resource, including protective

protein for beta-galactosidase (PPGB), methionine synthase,
proline-rich protein (PRP), translationally controlled tumor
protein (TCTP), alpha-galactosidase, UDP-glucose glucosyltransferase, malate dehydrogenase, pectinesterase, and glycinerich protein (GRP). Other cell wall related genes including
pectin methylesterases (PMEs) and xyloglucan endotransglycosylases (XETs) have five ESTs each. Eight ESTs encoding
cyclin or cyclin-like and seven ESTs encoding cell cycle
proteins were identified in radiata pine. These cell cycle
genes can activate cell-cycle machinery and cell division
[27]. Interestingly, most genes involved in lignin biosynthesis were present in radiata pine wood formation. Laccases, SAMS and CCoAOMT are in the 30 highly abundant
genes with 29 to 46 ESTs (Table 4). C4H, 4CL, peroxidase,
CAD, C3H, COMT and dirigent-like protein are moderately
abundant with seven to 18 ESTs. CCR and PAL also
occurred with two ESTs each in the radiata pine EST
resource.
Based on the Pfam database, 772 known protein families
were identified in radiata pine. The 30 most highly abundant families included 11 protein families related to cell
wall
biosynthesis
(Table
5).
Unsurprisingly,
cellulose_synt is the most abundant family with 108 ESTs.
Other abundant protein families included actin, tubulin,
tubulin_C, meth_synt_2, methltransf_3, peroxidase, SAdoMet_synt_C, glyco_hydro_19 and glyco_hydro_9
(Table 5). These abundant families included many known
proteins associated with cell wall formation, such as
CesAs, actins, tubulins (α and β), methionine synthases,
MetE, CCoAOMT, peroxidases, SAMS, chitinases and cellulases. However, AGPs are not recognized as proteins in
the Pfam database, thus they are not listed in the abundant protein families. The most abundant protein families
here are broadly consistent with the most abundant genes
based on UniProt and TIGR databases (Table 4).
Identification of transcription factors
PlantTFDB, a recently developed database of transcription
factor (TF) families for 22 plant species [28], was used to
identify putative transcription factors expressed in radiata
pine wood formation. Blastx searches revealed 358 ESTs
(assembled into 284 unigenes) of radiata pine with
matches in PlantTFDB at E-value ≤ 10-5. These homologs

fell into 41 families (Table 6) and represented 64.1% of
the 64 TF families in the poplar genome, suggesting extensive involvement of transcription factors in the regulation
of xylogenesis gene expression. The most abundant TF
family in radiata pine wood formation is PHD (Cys4-HisCys3 zinc finger) with 55 ESTs. Other TF families with at

least five ESTs included C3H, HB, C2H2, NAC, MYBrelated, MYB, AP2-EREBP, PcG, bHLH, LIM, EIL, HMG,
C2C2-GATA, LUG, WRKY, bZIP, GARP-G2-like, SBP and
Trihelix. The higher abundance of PHD, C3H, MYB,
HMG, WRKY, NAC, HB and bZIP in radiata pine xylogenesis was also observed in white spruce [14].

Transcriptome reorganization during wood development
The ESTs and unigenes from different libraries represent
the transcriptome in the respective wood development
stages. We compared the transcriptomes from juvenile
earlywood, juvenile latewood, mature earlywood and
mature latewood tissues. These four tissues were collected
from trees growing within 50 m of each other, and at the
same date for earlywood or latewood to minimize the
environmental effects. Comparative transcriptome analysis highlighted 306 and 150 GO terms showing significant
differences (P-value < 0.01) in terms of EST and unigene
abundance, respectively. The hierarchical clustering dendrogram trees from both ESTs and unigenes revealed similar patterns of transcriptome reorganization during wood
formation in radiata pine (Figure 3A, B), which suggested
that juvenile earlywood has a distinct transcriptome compared to the other three developmental stages, whereas
the transcriptome of juvenile latewood is more conserved
with mature earlywood and latewood. The distinct gene
expression in juvenile earlywood is likely associated with
the unique properties of juvenile wood.

ondary wall biosynthesis (ie, peroxidase, AGP5, FLA17,
CAD and CesA1) are more expressed in mature wood.
Interestingly, in the large AGP gene family, PrAGP4 is
more expressed in earlywood, while PrAGP5 and PrFLA17
are more expressed in mature wood, suggesting divergent
roles of different AGP genes during wood formation.
GO term enrichments in different stages of wood development were also revealed using DAVID Bioinformatics
Resources 2008 (Additional file 5). Specifically enriched
GO terms in earlywood included: cellular component
organization and biogenesis, membrane, protein complex, catalytic activity, hydrolase activity and transporter
activity. Latewood specifically enriched terms included:
cellular macromolecule metabolic process, protein modification process, cytoplasm, nucleotide binding, and protein kinase activity. The number of specifically enriched
GO terms in juvenile wood is about two times as in
mature wood, suggesting more unique gene expression in
juvenile wood than mature wood (Additional file 5). The
most enriched specific GO terms in juvenile wood
included: cellular macromolecule metabolic process,
intracellular organelle part, protein complex, hydrolase
activity, and nucleotide binding; while in latewood cellu-

Discussion
The 6,389 xylogenesis ESTs and 3,304 unigenes described
here form a significant genomic resource for radiata pine.
Being derived from major stages of wood development in
a typical rotation period, this resource represents a broad
xylogenesis transcriptome in the species. The highest proportion of ESTs is derived from juvenile wood and will

assist in understanding transcriptional regulation at this
stage. Most families of genes involved in secondary cell
wall development are represented in the EST resource.
Gene expression in secondary wall formation
Lignin biosynthesis is a key developmental feature that
distinguishes secondary from primary cell walls. The synthesized monolignols are transported to the apoplast,
where polymerisation starts in the middle lamella and cell
corners [29]. Most genes in the monolignol pathway are
represented with high or moderate abundance in radiata
pine xylogenesis including SAMS, MetE,laccase,
CCoAOMT, C4H, 4CL,methionine synthase,peroxidase,CAD,

Hierarchical clustering dendrogram trees for juvenile
and mature wood cDNA libraries. ESTs or unigenes
from each of the four libraries (juvenile earlywood-JE, juvenile latewood-JL, mature earlywood-ME and mature latewood-ML) were annotated against the UniProt and TIGR
databases, and assigned with GO terms. The abundance of
ESTs or unigenes in each GO term was calculated for each
library, and further normalized as a percentage based on the
number of ESTs or unigenes in each library. Statistical significance of EST or unigene abundance in each GO term among
the four libraries was valuated by Chi Square tests and P-values. The normalized EST or unigene abundance was used to
construct the hierarchical clustering dendrogram trees. A:
the dendrogram tree for ESTs. B: the dendrogram tree for
unigenes.
C3H, COMT and cytochrome c oxidase. A total of 46 radiata
pine ESTs (four contigs and two singletons) were found to
encode SAMS protein. Lignin precursors are extensively
methylated in the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) dependent reaction [30]. In white spruce seven SAMS genes were
previously identified [14]. Some other lignin biosynthetic
genes were also identified at lower abundance including
CCR, PAL and dirigent-like. The dirigent protein was presumed to act as a template for lignin polymerization [31].
The presence and abundance of most lignin biosynthetic
genes in the radiata pine EST collection suggests active secondary cell wall biosynthesis in the xylem tissues sampled.
Cellulose is deposited in both primary and secondary cell
walls, but is much more abundant in secondary walls.
CesA is the most abundant gene in the radiata pine EST
collection with 175 ESTs representing six of the eight previously isolated PrCesA genes [32]. A phylogenetic tree of
plant CesAs (Figure 4) constructed using Muscle [33] and
MEGA 4 [34] revealed that five of the six PrCesA proteins
identified in this study are most homologous to the secondary wall CesAs of Arabidopsis [35]. The five PrCesAs are

also most homologous to the secondary wall CesAs of
Populus [36-38] and loblolly pine [39]. Interestingly, the
five PrCesAs cover all three sub groups of plant secondary
wall CesAs represented by three Arabidopsis secondary wall
CesAs (AtCesA4, AtCesA7 and AtCesA8), respectively, suggesting the functional conservation of secondary wall
CesAs across angiosperm and gymnosperm taxa. A single
EST encoding PrCesA10 was clustered with primary cell
wall CesAs, suggesting primary wall PrCesA genes are
poorly presented in the radiata pine EST resource. Cellulases and SuSy are also highly expressed during radiata
pine wood formation. Cellulase may be part of the cellulose synthesizing complex and required for wall assembly
and elongation [40]. A membrane-bound cellulase isoenzyme is up-regulated in poplar secondary walls [5]. In
Scots pine SuSy activity was observed to peak in the zone
of maturing tracheids where the secondary wall is formed,
and its expression was lowest in primary wall tissues [41].
Hemicelluloses and pectin form a large group of heteropolysaccharides composed of D-xylose, L-arabinose, Lrhamnose, L-fucose, D-mannose, D-galactose, D-galacturonate, or D-glucose. In the radiata pine EST collection we
identified genes involved in the synthesis and degradation
of hemicellulose and pectin biosynthesis, including 21
ESTs (three contigs) of UDP-glucose dehydrogenase. UDPD-glucuronate synthesis is the rate-limiting step for the
biosynthesis of both hemicellulose and pectin [42]. We
also identified four radiata pine ESTs of xyloglucan
endotransglycosylases (XETs). XETs can cut and rejoin
xyloglucan (XG) chains, and are believed to be important
regulators of primary cell wall expansion [43]. One radiata pine XET is most homologous to Arabidopsis XTH8,
which belongs to the same class as PttXET16A, a poplar
secondary wall XET [44]. The considerable involvement of
XETs in secondary walls is likely in the breakage and
reconnection of linkages between adjacent microfibrils
soon after their synthesis.
AGPs, AGP-like proteins and FLAs are highly abundant in
the radiata pine EST collection with a total of 89 ESTs. The
ortholog of loblolly pine PtaAGP4 is the most abundant
AGP in radiata pine with 45 ESTs. Other identified radiata
pine AGPs include PrAGP5, PrAGP6, PrAGP-like and
PrFLAs (PrFLA1, 8, 10, 12, 16, 17 and 26). Six loblolly pine
PtaAGPs (AGP3, AGP4, AGP5, AGP6, 3H6 and 14A9) were
predominantly expressed in xylem [45]. The role of these
AGPs in secondary wall development is currently
unknown. In loblolly pine PtaAGP6 epitopes are restricted
to cells formed immediately before secondary cell wall
thickening [46]. However, the preponderance of genes in
the radiata pine EST resource that are clearly involved in
secondary wall development suggests that AGPs may also
play an important role in secondary wall synthesis. AGPs
were also found to be expressed in xylem tissues of

Angiosperms. In Populus 15 FLAs are expressed in xylem,
ten of which are up-regulated in tension wood [47]. While
in eucalypts two FLAs are strongly up-regulated in upper
branch wood [15]. A tobacco AGP is a candidate linker at
the cell surface to mediate signal transduction between
the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton [48].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/41

Expression of cytoskeleton-related genes
Conspicuous in the radiata pine xylem EST resource are
genes encoding the cytoskeletal proteins: tubulin, actin
and other cytoskeletal-associated proteins. The cytoskeleton provides the structural basis for cell polarity establishment and maintenance [49,50]. Cellulose microfibril
arrangement and deposition is believed to be directed by
cortical microtubules, the dynamic heteropolymer arrays
of α-tubulin and β-tubulin proteins. A Eucalyptus grandis tubulin gene (EgrTUB1) has been implicated in determining the orientation of cellulose microfibrils in plant secondary walls [51]. Two Populus tremuliodes -tubulin genes
(TUA1 and TUA5) are highly expressed in wood tissues
[52] and ten tubulin genes in Populus tremula × P. tremuliodes are up-regulated in secondary walls [5]. In the radiata
pine EST resource, a total of 102 ESTs were annotated to
encode tubulin proteins, among which three tubulin genes
(PrTUA1, PrTUB2 and PrTUB3) are highly or moderately
abundant with 52, 26 and 15 ESTs, respectively. These
three PrTUBs are most homologous to poplar tubulin
genes that are strongly expressed in xylem tissues [52].

Actin microfilaments ensure the delivery of vesicles to specific sites in plant cells and are involved in cell shape
determination [53]. Actin genes are highly abundant in
the radiata pine EST collection with a total of 58 ESTs (six
contigs and five singletons). Other actin related and interacting genes are also found, including ADF, actin binding
protein (ABP), actin-related protein (ARP), profilin and villin.
Arabidopsis has ten actin genes [53], eight actin-related
proteins (ARP) [54] and many actin-interacting proteins
including profilin, actin depolymerisation factor (ADF),
fimbrin, villin, rho-type small GTPase, capping protein,
and actin-interacting cyclise-associated protein [55,56].
The radiata pine ARPs are the putative homologs to Arabidopsis ARP2, ARP3 and ARP6, suggesting the possible
involvement of the ARP2/3 complex in actin cytoskeleton
development during radiata pine xylem formation.
Cytoskeleton formation involves cycling dynamics of
polymerization and depolymerization of its basic structural subunits, such as G-actin and tubulin dimers. Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and actin-binding
proteins (ABPs) are believed to regulate the dynamic
cytoskeletal changes [57]. In the radiata pine EST resource,
several transcripts are present for MAPs (three ESTs),
microtubule-binding protein (one EST) and actin-binding
protein (two ESTs). Kinesin-1 (conventional kinesin) is a
dimeric motor protein that carries cellular cargo along
microtubules [58]. A novel kinesin (GhKCH1) from cotton fibers plays a role in coordinating the actin network
with the cortical microtubule array [59]. We identified
eight radiata pine ESTs annotated as kinesin-1 or kinesinlike proteins which may have similar roles in actin and
microtubule interactions.

Transcription factors in secondary wall formation
Of the 64 transcription factor families in poplar genome,
41 families (64.1%) are presented in the radiata pine xylogenesis genomic resource (Table 6). These transcription
factor families include many regulatory genes, such as
MYBs, MADS-box, LIM domain, zinc finger, Class III HDZip, WRKY and AUX/IAA. Several members of NAC, MYB,
zinc finger, LIM domain, MADS-box, AUX/IAA and homeodomain (HD) are believed to regulate secondary wall
biosynthesis [60-65]. MYBs and zinc fingers can recognise
AC elements in the promoters of many monolignol biosynthesis genes [65-67]. Some members of the NAC and
MYB families are the key switches in the transcriptional
network for secondary wall development [65].

Three radiata pine ESTs of R2R3-type MYB are most
homolgous to the three secondary xylem MYB genes
(MYB2, MYB4 and MYB8) in loblolly pine and Picea
glauca [68]. In loblolly pine PtMYB1 and PtMYB4 are transcriptional activators of lignin synthesis [66,67]. The Eucalyptus EgMYB2 regulates lignin biosynthesis through
binding to AC element [69]. Homeobox domain (HD)
transcription factors were also identified in the radiata
pine EST resource with 29 ESTs (two contigs). Three radiata pine ESTs were annotated as AUX/IAA genes. Auxin
can rapidly induce AUX/IAA gene expression [70] and five
AUX/IAA genes from hybrid aspen are up-regulated in
xylem [71].
In radiata pine EST resource Class III HD-Zip genes were
represented by 15 ESTs (six unigenes). Five Arabidopsis
HD-Zip III genes are up-regulated in secondary xylem
[63,72] and the hybrid aspen class III HD-Zip gene
(PtaHB1) is closely associated with wood formation [73].
Eleven radiata pine ESTs (four unigenes) were annotated
as LIM domain and four ESTs (one unigene) as MADS-box.
A tobacco LIM protein can bind to the Pal-box sequence
in the promoter regions of several phenylpropanoid biosynthesis genes [61]. Some Arabidopsis MADS-box genes
have been implicated in the regulation of lignin biosynthesis [62].
Gene expression and wood properties
Wood formation is a complex and continuous process
involving a series of developmental stages during which
considerable variation in wood properties is observed.
Compared to mature wood, juvenile wood shows higher
spiral grain, lower density, higher microfibril angle
(MFA), more longitudinal shrinkage, lower cellulose content, higher lignin content, more pectin and shorter tracheids [1,3,74]. Compared to latewood, earlywood has
higher growth rate, thinner cell walls, larger radial lumen,
more lignin, lower hemicellulose, lower pectin, slightly
lower cellulose, higher MFA and lower density [74-76].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/41

Most of the distinguishing properties of juvenile wood are
due to the high proportion of earlywood in the juvenile
wood [77]. The SilviScan profiling [78] of mature radiata
pine trees revealed the unique morphology and wood
properties of juvenile earlywood compared to other wood
development stages (Figure 5 and Additional file 6). Juvenile earlywood forms a larger proportion in the early rings
and has lower density, higher microfibril angle (MFA),
lower modulus of elasticity (MOE) and thinner cell walls.
These unique phenotypic characteristics of juvenile earlywood are likely to be caused by its distinct transcriptome
(Figure 3A, B). Some genes involved in cellulose synthesis
and secondary wall formation are more strongly expressed
in latewood and mature wood than in earlywood and
juvenile wood, respectively (P-value < 0.05) (Additional
file 3 and 4), which may be associated with some of the
observed differences in wood quality between the different wood tissues, such as cellulose content and cell wall
thickness. Many genes related to lignin biosynthesis are
more abundant in earlywood and mature wood than in
latewood and juvenile wood, respectively; however, only
some genes are statistically significant (P-value < 0.05)
(Table 7). These differences in gene abundance may give
rise to the higher lignin content found in earlywood and
mature wood.
Although Audic and Claverei proposed a statistical
method [79] to test the significance of digital gene expression, the preferentially expressed genes (even statistically
significant genes) derived from gene abundance analysis
still require further validation, such as microarray experiments, real time RT-PCR or other alternative methods.
Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification
(MLPA) [80] was used in this study for validation of
selected genes (Table 8). The normalized ratio of EST
abundance and MLPA gene expression ratio is highly
comparable for a proline-rich protein (PRP) gene in both
earlywood and latewood at transition age, as well as for a
dehydrin gene in latewood at transition age. The MLPA
gene expressions of AGP4 and peroxidase at both juvenile
and transition ages confirmed their high EST abundances
in earlywood. However, MLPA expression values of some
genes may differ from their EST abundances (Table 8),
suggesting EST abundance could not infer the exact gene
expression level.

Conclusion
The radiata pine genomic resource was developed from six
developing xylem libraries with 6,389 high quality ESTs
and 3,304 unigenes. This is the first large scale and publicly available genomic resource for radiata pine. Many
genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis and transcription
factors were identified in the wood formation of radiata
pine. Comparative analysis among different development

A wood core and SilviScan profile of wood density for a 32-year-old radiata pine tree. The cross section of wood
core sampled at 1.3 m height shows the annual change in width and colour of earlywood and latewood within each ring. Wood
density is the most important wood trait for the sawmill timber industry. SilviScan profiling for wood density of radiata pine
revealed the distinct characteristics of juvenile wood, particularly juvenile earlywood, compared to transition and mature
wood. SilviScan analysis was performed in the method of Evans, et al, 2000 [78].
stages revealed a distinct transcriptome in juvenile earlywood. Genes with relatively more expression in earlywood, latewood, juvenile wood and mature wood were
also identified, respectively. The identified genes in this
study will be candidates for functional genomics and
association studies in radiata pine. This genomic resource
will also be valuable for comparative genomics of wood
formation in forest trees.

Methods
Plant material
In order to broadly represent the xylogenesis transcriptome in radiata pine, developing xylem tissues were sampled at six critical development stages: earlywood (spring)
and latewood (autumn) tissues collected at juvenile (7
yrs), transition (11 yrs) and mature (30 yrs) ages. Two 7year-old and two 30-year-old trees were sampled at Yarralumla ACT in August 2004 (spring) and April 2005
(autumn). Three 11-year-old trees were sampled at Bondo
NSW in September 2003 (spring) and April 2004
(autumn). Developing xylem tissues were collected by
scraping the thin (approximately 1.0 mm) and partially
lignified layer on the exposed xylem surface at breast
height. All xylem tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen in the field, and then stored in the laboratory
at -80°C for later RNA extraction.

cDNA library construction and colony isolation
Total RNA was extracted using the method of Chang, et al
[81] with slight modification. Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated using the polyATtract system III/IV (Promega, CA).
Five micrograms of mRNA were used as starting template
for cDNA library construction using the ZAP-cDNAGigapack III Gold Cloning Kit (Stratagene, CA). After first and
second strand cDNA synthesis, the radioactive cDNA samples were checked on an alkaline agarose gel and exposed
to x-ray film. The double strand cDNAs were fractionated
using a drip column filled with Sepharose CL-2B gel. The
fractions at approximately 600 bp or more were pooled
and ligated into the EcoRI/XhoI cloning site in the UniZAP XR vector. One to two microliters of ligated cDNA
inserts were packaged using Gigapack III Gold Packaging
Extract. To make a large quantity of high titer stock of the
lambda phage library, the primary libraries were amplified according to the manufacturer's protocols (Stratagene, CA). The pBluescript phagemids containing cDNA
inserts were mass excised in vivo from the Uni-ZAP XR
vector using Ex-Assist helper phage and XL1-Blue MRF'.
The titer of lambda phage and phagemid libraries was
measured using the host cells of XL1-Blue MRF' strain and
SOLR strain, respectively. Library quality and the size of
cDNA inserts were determined by PCR screening of 96
randomly selected clones. All lambda phage cDNA libraries were stored at -80°C.

The excised phagemids were replicated in SOLR cells and
grown on LB-ampicillin agar plates overnight at 37°C for
colony isolation. All phagemid colonies were picked out
and put into LB broth with ampicillin. Colony picking
was done by a Versarray Colony Picking Robot (Bio-Rad,
CA) or manually with a tooth-pick. The picked colonies
were cultured overnight at 37°C with shaking. These suspension cultures were used for PCR reactions and EST
sequencing, or stored at -80°C in glycerol stock for later
use.
EST sequencing and assembly
An average of 1,200 cDNA clones from each of the six
libraries was used for EST sequencing. Approximately
8,000 sequencing reactions were performed on a total of
7,200 cDNA clones. The cDNA inserts were PCR amplified
using the M13 forward and reverse primers followed by

clean-up with ExoSap (GE Healthcare, UK). The sequencing primer for the 5' end of cDNA inserts was the SK, T3
or M13 primer. A small proportion of sequences were
obtained from the 3' end using the M13 forward primer.
The sequencing reaction was performed using BigDye 3.1.
After a quick start at 96°C 1 min, the reaction was cycled
25 times at 96°C 1 sec, 50°C 5 sec and 60°C 4 min, followed by holding at 4°C. After sodium acetate-EDTA-ethanol precipitation, the sequencing reaction was run using
ABI 3730 capillary sequencers (Applied Biosystems, CA).
The trace files were base called by Sequencing Analysis
v5.2 which was integrated into the ABI 3730 capillary
sequencers.
The raw EST sequences were processed using Sequencher
4.7 (Gene Codes Corporation, MI) to trim vector and
ambiguous ends. The poly(A) in the EST sequences was

deleted manually. A total of 6,389 high quality ESTs with
at least 100 bp in length were obtained. These ESTs were
submitted to dbEST at the National Center for Biotechnology Information with Genbank accession numbers
FE518213 to FE524601. The 5' end ESTs from 5,952 different clones were assembled to generate consensus
sequences for unigenes, including contigs and singletons.
The EST assembly was performed using the CAP3 program
[82] integrated in BIO301, an automated EST sequence
management and functional annotation system [83]. In
order to minimize chimeric contigs in assembly, an overlap of at least 40 bp and identity of sequence of at least
95% were used as thresholds in the assembly. The number
of ESTs in each contig was used to estimate the redundancy in the EST sequencing.
Annotation and functional classification
The high quality ESTs and derived unigenes were used to
search the NCBI nr (non-redundant) database using
blastx and tblastx (E-value ≤ 10-5). They were also used to
search the UniProt known protein database [84] using
blastx (E-value ≤ 10-5). The sequences with no matches in
UniProt were further blasted against the TIGR all tentative
consensus sequence gene indices database [85] using
blastn (E-value ≤ 10-15). Putative functions for ESTs and
unigenes were assigned with GO (Gene Ontology) terms
[86]. To identify the known protein families, the ESTs
were also searched with the Pfam protein family database
[87] using blastx (E-value ≤ 10-5). Initial functional classification was based on the assigned GO terms with two levels of classification. Gene enrichment analysis and further
functional classification on GO terms were conducted
using the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 2008 [23,24]
Identification and validation of differentially represented
genes
Comparison of EST abundance was used to identify differentially represented genes in different libraries or combined libraries. Number of ESTs for each gene in different
libraries was previously normalized at the presumed same
number of ESTs in each library. A normalized ratio of EST
abundance was calculated for the comparisons. The significance of differentially represented genes was statistically
tested using the method from Audic and Claverie [79].

Preferentially represented genes were validated using the
strategy of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) [80]. More specifically we used the RT-MLPA
protocol for mRNA detection and quantification. Four
genes (AGP4, proline-rich protein, peroxidase and dehydrin)
preferentially represented in the combined earlywood or
latewood libraries were included in the validation. Gene
expressions of these four genes were detected in earlywood and latewood tissues from three radiata pine trees at
transition age (11 yrs). In addition, expressions of AGP4
and peroxidase were also measured in earlywood and late-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/41

wood tissues from eight radiata pine trees at juvenile age
(5 yrs). We used four technical replicates in RT-MLPA.
Reverse transcription for ~400 ng total RNA after DNase
treatment was performed using the ImProm-II Reverse
Transcription System (Promega, WI) and oligo (dT)15.
Synthesized cDNA was hybridized with mixed NPK and
LIG probes designed for the validated genes (Additional
file 7) at 60°C overnight, followed by ligation and PCR
amplification with SALSA D4 primer. Mixture PCR products from multiple genes were separated and analysed
using the CEQ™ 8000 Genetic Analysis System (Beckman
Coulter, CA).
