Abstract
Salmonid alphavirus (SAV) causes disease in farmed salmonid fish and is divided into different
genetic subtypes (SAV1-6). Here we report the cloning and characterization of the 5'- and 3'untranslated regions (UTR) of a SAV3 isolated from Atlantic salmon in Norway. The sequences of
the UTRs are very similar to those of SAV1 and SAV2, but single nucleotide polymorphisms are
present, also in the 3' - conserved sequence element (3'-CSE). Prediction of the RNA secondary
structure suggested putative stem-loop structures in both the 5'- and 3'-ends, similar to those of
alphaviruses from the terrestrial environment, indicating that the general genome replication
initiation strategy for alphaviruses is also utilized by SAV. A DNA replicon vector, pmSAV3, based
upon a pVAX1 backbone and the SAV3 genome was constructed, and the SAV3 non-structural
proteins were used to express a reporter gene controlled by the SAV3 subgenomic promoter.
Transfection of pmSAV3 into CHSE and BF2 cell lines resulted in expression of the reporter
protein, confirming that the cloned SAV3 replication apparatus and UTRs are functional in fish cells.

Findings
Salmonid alphaviruses (SAVs) cause disease in farmed salmonids both in freshwater and the marine environment
in Europe [1]. The virus, also known as Salmon pancreas
disease virus, was molecularly characterized during the late
1990-ies, and assigned to the genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae [2,3]. Alphaviruses have single-stranded
RNA genomes of 11-12 kb length with a 5'-terminal cap
and a 3'-terminal polyadenylated tail. The coding
sequences are organized into two large non-overlapping
open reading frames (ORFs) that are flanked by three
untranslated regions (UTRs). The first ORF is approximately 8 kb and encodes the non-structural proteins
(nsPs) 1-4, while the second ORF is approximately 4 kb
and encodes the structural proteins capsid, E3, E2, 6K, TF

and E1. The second ORF is transcribed from an anti-sense
genome under the control of a subgenomic promoter in
the untranslated region that separates the two ORFs [4,5].
The genome is replicated by the nsPs, which together with
host proteins make up the replicase complex (RC). The
nsPs are translated as a polyprotein, P1234, that is cleaved
by a papain-like serine protease of the nsP2 component.
The different cleavage products of the RC have several
roles during replication that include (i) recognition of
viral genomic RNA and transcription of an anti-sense
genome, (ii) recognition of the anti-sense genome and
transcription of a new genome strand and (iii) recognition of the subgenomic promoter on the anti-sense
genome and transcription of a subgenomic mRNA that
contains the second ORF. The untranslated regions

(UTRs) in the genomic 5'- and 3'- ends act as promoters
for transcription of genomic and anti-genomic RNA. The
RNA secondary structure found in conserved sequence
elements (CSEs), rather than the primary sequence,
appears to be the prominent factor in the function of these
promoters [6].
Alphaviruses have been widely used in reverse genetics
and protein expression systems. A common strategy used
in alphaviral reverse genetics has been cloning of the viral
genome under the control of an RNA polymerase promoter following transcription into a capped and polyadenylated self-replicating RNA [7]. In alphavirus-based
replicons the subgenomic, second ORF is replaced with
that of the gene of interest (GOI). Expression of the GOI
is then executed by the alphavirus replication apparatus.
Such replicons are frequently used for basic studies of
alphavirus replication and for in vivo expression of GOIs,
and can be used as vector systems in vaccination. Alphaviral based expression systems are useful for the latter application since they typically provide high expression of the
transgene as well as activation of innate antiviral response
in the transfected/transducted cell [8].
SAV is not genetically homogenous in Europe. Sequence
comparisons of SAV isolates suggest that at least six distinct virus reservoirs exist and this has resulted in evolution into the subtypes SAV1-6 [9-11]. The coding
sequence of nsP3 is particularly variable between the subtypes and contains several insertions/deletions with
unknown effect in the C-terminal region. The SAV2 subtype appears to be widespread in freshwater farmed rainbow trout in continental Europe, whereas subtypes 1, 4, 5
and 6 have been found in Atlantic salmon from overlapping areas off the coast of Ireland, Northern Ireland and
Scotland. In Norway a genetically homogeneous subtype,
SAV3, is found to infect both Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout on the southwest coast, but has only occasionally been found in northern Norway [10,12].
A replicon allowing viral subgenomic promoter-driven
expression of a GOI, as well as a reverse genetics system,
has been developed for an attenuated strain of SAV2 [13].
In that system the SAV2 genome was transcribed by either
T7 RNA polymerase or cellular RNA polymerase II, and
the system has been useful for functional studies of SAV2
[13]. SAV3 and SAV2 represent two subtypes of the Salmonid alphavirus species showing approximately 7.1%
nucleotide sequence differences in their genomic
sequences [10]. SAV3 causes disease in farmed salmonids
in the marine grow-out phase, while SAV2 typically causes
disease in rainbow trout fingerlings. The optimum temperature for replication may also differ, as it appears to be
lower for SAV2 than for SAV3 [1]. In order to learn more
about these differences, we sought to obtain tools to study

the replication apparatus of SAV3. The genomic ends of
SAV3 had not been characterized. Therefore, we cloned
and sequenced these from chinook salmon embryo
(CHSE) cell cultures infected with SAVH20/03 [10] passage 28, using 5'- and 3'- rapid amplification of cDNA
ends (RACE) kits (Invitrogen) as recommended by the
manufacturer. Nucleotide sequence alignment of SAV3
UTRs with those of SAV1 and SAV2 (sequences of the
UTRs of SAV4-6 subtypes were not available) demonstrated 100% identity of the 5'-UTR of SAV3 (SAVH20/03)
and SAV2 strain rSDV, while four nucleotide polymorphisms were present in the 3'-UTR. Interestingly, one of
these polymorphisms was found in the 3'-CSE (Fig. 1a).
The 3'-CSE is conserved among alphaviruses, and functions as promoter for the initiation of minus-strand transcription [6].
The 5'- and 3'-UTRs of SAV are the shortest known among
alphaviruses [14]. This has caused speculation as to
whether SAV transcription initiation could be independent of a stem-loop structure in the genomic 5'- end [13].
Since secondary structure rather than nucleotide sequence
in the 5'-UTR is decisive for initiation of genomic replication in other alphaviruses [6], the lack of a stem-loop in
the SAV 5'-UTR would imply a different strategy for
polymerase/promoter recognition. The distinct phylogenetic position of SAV, and vast evolutionary distance from
terrestrial alphaviruses could make this plausible [2,15].
However, in silico analysis using Mfold RNA secondary
structure predictor [16] with folding temperature set to
14°C (the replication temperature for SAV3), suggested
that SAV 5'-UTR might form two short stem-loops in the
5'-end, and that a portion of the coding sequence of nsP1
is likely to be part of the second structure (Fig. 1b). In the
3'-UTR, four stem loops were predicted (Fig. 1c). Due to
the observed polymorphisms in the 3'-CSE, it is predicted
that SAV3 has a slightly longer stem loop than SAV2 (Fig.
1d).
Knowledge of the ultimate ends and thus full-length
sequence of SAV3 (isolate SAVH20/03), allowed construction of a SAV3 based replicon. Using a similar strategy as
previously used for SAV2 [13], we constructed the plasmid
pmSAV3 (Fig. 2a). The plasmid has the following characteristics: (i) a pVAX1 (Invitrogen) backbone optimized for
DNA-vaccination, with a transcription unit controlled by
the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early promoter
and a bovine growth hormone (BGH) polyadenylation
signal, (ii) the SAV3 genome in which the structural ORF
has been replaced with that of the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP), flanked by AgeI and AscI restriction
enzyme sites, (iii) a polyadenylated tail fused directly to
the 3'-UTR of SAV3, and (iv) a hammerhead ribozyme
fused directly to the SAV3 5'-UTR. The latter was included
since a correct genomic 5'-end has been reported to be

Ribozyme generation was done by annealing oligos
5HHribo2/3HHribo2 followed by polymerisation using
Klenow fragment (TaKaRa), as earlier described [13].
Primers and restriction enzyme sites that were used for
cloning purposes are listed in Table 1. The authenticity of
the plasmid construction was verified by EcoRI, AgeI and
AscI (New England Biolabs) digestion (Fig. 2b) and by
sequencing as previously described [12]. This information
indicated that eight substitutions were present in the RC
coding region compared to the nucleotide sequence of
passage 20 of the parental strain SAVH20/03 (Table 2).
One of the substitutions, the R to C in the nsP3 region,
was reported to be present in passage 3 of SAVH20/03
[10], suggesting that it could be part of a viral quasispecies.

orescence microscopy (Fig. 2c). In these experiments
transfected cells were kept for 24 h at 20°C, then moved
to 14°C, at which SAV3 replication is efficient [12]. The
incubation step at 20°C enables the efficient transcription
from the CMV promoter, which is more active at 20°C
than at 14°C in CHSE cells (personal observation). In this
SAV3 replicon system, expression of the EGFP reporter
showed slower kinetics compared to the positive control
used, i.e. EGFP under the direct control of the CMV promoter as in the plasmid pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), where
EGFP typically can be observed as early as 6-12 h post
transfection (p.t) (not shown). The earliest SAV3 replicon
expression of EGFP was observed 2 days p.t. in CHSE cells
and 3 days p.t. in BF2 cells. The number of positive cells
peaked between days 6 and 8 p. t. in CHSE cells and
around day 14 p.t. in BF2 cells.

Transfection of pmSAV3 into CHSE or BF2 cells using
Amaxa nucleofector kit T (Lonza) or Metafectene Pro
according to producer recommendations resulted in
expression of the EGFP reporter that was visualized by flu-

the vector backbone were not functional (not shown).
This is similar to previous reports for DNA-launched SINV
replicons [17], and suggests that SAV expression is sensitive for erroneous sequences between the 3'-UTR and the
polyadenylated tail. Presumably, this has a negative effect
on minus-strand synthesis as observed for SINV [18]. A
different construct, pmSAV3M10, where the SAV3 3'-CSE
was exchanged with SAV2 3'-CSE was also tested for its
ability to express the reporter. This plasmid was generated
by amplifying the 3'-UTR with primers AscI3UTRF and
NotIXbaIPolyAR, where the latter primer sequence contained the SAV2 3'-CSE (Table 2). The 3'-UTR of pmSAV3
was then exchanged with the amplification product
through AscI/XbaI cleavage and ligation. In transfection
studies this construct showed expression kinetics similar
to those observed for pmSAV3, confirming that the SAV3
replicase complex is able to recognise the SAV2 3'-CSE
during replication. Moreover, this suggests that the polymorphisms observed in the 3'-CSE have little or no impact
for SAV replication, and as predicted by in silico analysis,
are of minor importance for the RNA secondary structure.
The pmSAV3 based plasmids can become valuable tools
for functional studies of the SAV3 that currently is
regarded as enzootic on the Norwegian west coast, but
they may also be used for development of vectored vaccines for use in cold-water fish. It will be of interest to
compare the performance of SAV3- and SAV2-based replicons [13] in such studies.
